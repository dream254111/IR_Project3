j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1013965,Purpose and Scope of War Risk Insurance,i242668,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF WAR RISK INSURANCE BY SAMUEL McCUNE LINDSAY Professor of Social Legislation Columbia University The War Risk Insurance Act is now the official designation of that body of law which began with the establishment of a Bureau of War Risk Insurance in the Treasury Department by the Act of Congress of September 2 1914 The Bureaus powers and duties have been greatly expanded and modified by numerous amend ments and subsequent enactments It may be well to trace briefly at the outset the various steps in the history of this momentous legislation which constitutes so important a chapter of our special war legislation The act of September 2 1914 passed within a little over a month after the outbreak of the European war and while we were still a neutral nation explained its purpose in a preamble which said Whereas the foreign commerce of the United States is now greatly impeded and endangered through the absence of adequate facilities for the insurance of Ameri can vessels and their cargoes against the risks of war and whereas it is deemed necessary and expedient that the United States shall temporarily provide for the export shipping trade of the United States adequate facilities for the insurance of its commerce against the risks of war therefore be it enacted etc Then followed the authority granted to the Secretary of the Treasury through the Bureau of War Risk Insurance to issue in surance on American vessels and their cargoes and the appropria tion of funds for these purposes It was intended as a temporary measure and the President was authorized to suspend the operations of the act whenever in his judgment the necessity for further war in surance by the United States ceased to exist and in any event such suspension was to take place within two years after the passage of the act without however affecting outstanding insurance or claims pending at the time This provision for suspension of what is now the Division of Marine and Seamens Insurance has been extended by subsequent acts until by the amendment of July 11 1918 it is required to take place when the President so directs but in any event within six months after the end of the war except that for the purpose of the final adjustment of any such outstanding in surance or claims the Division of Marine and Seamens Insurance 52WAR RISK INSURANCE may in the discretion of the President be continued in existence for a period not exceeding three years after such suspension It would seem therefore that as far as marine and seamens insurance is concerned Congress has consistently declared its intention to provide government insurance merely as a temporary war measure INSURANCE ACTS OF CONGRESS Congress extended the scope of marine insurance by the Act of June 12 1917 which directed the bureau subject to the general direction of the Secretary of the Treasury to make provisions for the insurance by the United States of masters officers and crews of American merchant vessels against loss of life or personal injury by the risks of war and for compensation during detention follow ing capture by enemies of the United States whenever it shall appear to the Secretary that in any trade the need for such insur ance exists This act not only authorized the bureau to make provision for insurance and compensation for injury death and detention fol lowing capture by enemies for officers and crews of American mer chant vessels but it made such insurance and compensation com pulsory by providing that in the event of failure of the owner of any vessel to effect the insurance of master officer and crew prior to sailing in accordance with the plan it outlined the Secretary of the Treasury was authorized to effect it with the bureau at the expense of the owner The expense of the premium with interest and a penalty not to exceed 1000 in addition with interest and costs was made a lien on the vessel The compensation provided by this amendatory act for sea men is as follows In case of death or permanent disability which prevents the person injured from performing any and every kind of duty pertaining to his occupation or the loss of both hands both arms both feet both legs or both eyes or any two thereof     An amount equivalent to one years earnings or to twelve times the monthly earnings of the insured as fixed in the articles for the voy age     but in no case     more than 5000 or less than 1500 A percentage of this sum is allowed for the loss of one hand 50 one arm 65 one foot 50 one leg 65 one eye 45 total loss of hearing 50 and the bureau may include in its policy speci fied percentages for other losses or disabilities 53THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY In case of detention by an enemy of the United States follow ing capture payment is made during the continuance of such deten tion at the same rate as the earnings immediately preceding such de tention but the aggregate payments under all these provisions may not exceed one years earnings as above determined Payments are made only to the master officer or member of the crew except in case of loss of life to his estate for distribution to his family free from liability of debt and in case of capture to his dependents if such have been designated by him Another extension of the scope of marine and seamens insur ance was effected by an amendatory act of July 11 1918 whereby When it appears to the Secretary of the Treasury that vessels of foreign friendly flags or their masters officers or crews or ship pers or importers in such vessels are unable in any trade to secure adequate war risk insurance on reasonable terms the bureau is authorized to make provisions for the insurance by the United States of 1 such vessels of foreign friendly flags their freight and passage moneys and personal effects of the masters officers and crews thereof against the risks of war when such vessels are chart ered or operated by the United States Shipping Board or its agent or chartered by any person a citizen of the United States and 2 the cargoes to be shipped in such vessels of foreign friendly flags whether or not they are so chartered The bureau may also at the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury issue insurance in the above circumstances to protect masters officers and crew against loss of life or personal injury and to include compensation during detention following capture The business success of marine and seamens insurance which has not cost the government thus far a dollar and the extent of the benefits and protection it has given to our shipping are referred to elsewhere in this volume The second stage in the development of war risk insurance began with the amendatory act of October 6 1917 which was in reality three great legislative proposals in one Any one of the three features of this act was destined to relegate to relative in significance the provisions for marine and seamens insurance and the previous work of the Bureau of War Risk Insurance This act sought to apply the principles of mutuality governmental coopera 1 See articles by Assistant Secretary Thos B Love and Lt Col S H Wolfe 54WAR RISK INSURANCE tion and insurance to lighten the burdens of war for our soldiers and sailors their families and dependents The act was drafted after preliminary studies had been made of Canadian and European ex perience by Lt Col then Captain S Herbert Wolfe and others for the Childrens Bureau of the Department of Labor after numerous conferences with experts in various fields including representatives of commercial life insurance interests and after a careful study of many of these reports and of the whole problem by the Committee on Labor of the Council of National Defense whose representative Judge Julian W Mack rendered the greatest service of all not only in drafting but in piloting the bill through its legislative history It had the intelligent personal and active support of Secretary McAdoo and the unqualified endorsement of the President Before describing the three great governmental services it es tablished for our fighting forces we may complete the legislative history by stating that it has been amended by two joint resolu tions one2 extending the period for application for insurance from men in the active war service as to whom the time for making application would expire before April 12 1918 and the other3 making provision for insurance to be taken out by third parties within the permitted class of beneficiaries for uninsured persons taken prisoner prior to April 12 1918 The act establishing the bureau as amended October 6 1917 has also been amended in important particulars by two subsequent acts the detailed effects of which will be taken into account in our subsequent description of the provisions for soldiers and sailors of the War Risk Insurance Act The act of May 20 1918 regulated the activities of claim agents and attorneys who solicited business in the adjustment of claims of beneficiaries under the War Risk Insurance Act fixing the maximum charges for such services at 300 per case if any such services are necessary or to be allowed one in most cases and providing that the benefits to the insured should be protected in every way possible from diminution by the costs of unnecessary legal services The second act was that of June 25 1918 which represented the administrative changes which the experience of the bureau in the first six months operation of the Division of Military and Naval 2 Pub Res No 2265th Cong Feb 12 1918 3 Pub Res No 2765th Cong Apr 2 1918 55THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY Insurance had shown to be desirable It simplified considerably the records of the bureau and diminished the delay in payments of family allowances due to some 200000 changes per month owing largely to changes in rate of pay by providing for a flat allotment of 15 for Class A dependents or Class B dependents alone or 20 for both as a condition for the granting of a family allowance in stead of a varying amount equal to the allowance but not less than these sums in the cases mentioned nor more than half the mans pay Other changes likewise were made in the direction of greater liberality on the part of the government and some of them were made retroactive by this act and will be noted in the description of the act of October 6 1917 which follows Insurance benefits in the strict sense are only part of the bene fits provided for soldiers and sailors and intended to safeguard the welfare and morale of the army and navy by the act of October 6 1917 which created the Military and Naval Division of the Bureau of War Risk Insurance It provides for three new effective and farreaching services of the federal government namely 1 Allotment of pay and family allowance 2 compensation and in demnity for death or disability 3 insurance against death or total and permanent disability4 I ALLOTMENTS OF PAY COMPULSORY AND VOLUNTARY AND FAMILY ALLOWANCES Congress had already prior to October 1917 laid the right foundation for this part of the War Risk Insurance Law by raising the pay of the enlisted men in the army and navy making the mini mum pay for nearly all in the service 30 a month or double what it was before in most cases and higher than that of any other army in the world This was a just measure to protect the highest stand ards of living in any country at a time when so many citizens were to be called upon to forsake their usual peaceful occupations But this was not enough to equalize the sacrifices which all citizens must make in time of war No rate of pay for the army and navy 4 In the description of these three services liberal use has been made of the descriptive accounts given by the author in articles published in the Review of Reviews for October 1917 and April 1918 and in a paper read before the Gen eral Meeting of the American Philosophical Society April 20 1918 and published in its Transactions 56WAR RISK INSURANCE could be made high enough to do that So Congress proceeded to supplement the regular pay upon the theory that since the call to arms does not annul the moral and legal obligations of every man to support his family and those who have a bloodtie claim upon his earnings it is the plain duty of the whole country which he serves to aid him financially to do this without undue lowering of his standard of living and without requiring a disproportionate sacri fice on the part of his dependents This is sound doctrine however only when the enlisted man first does his part and contributes from his own resources all he can reasonably spare Therefore we begin with the allotment which must precede a request for an allowance Allotments and family allowances are not provided for commissioned officers or for mem bers of the army or navy nurse corps female The allotment is compulsory for every enlisted man who has a wife or child under 18 years of age or of any age if the child is insane or permanently helpless or a divorced wife to whom alimony has been decreed by a court and who has not remarried These persons constitute what is known as Class A dependents A commonlaw wife is entitled to the same consideration as a legal wife and the claims of a legal wife and of all children take precedence of those of a divorced wife Every enlisted man is required to file with the War Risk Bureau a statement for which an allotment and allowance blank is furnished showing whether or not he has any dependents and if so how many and what are their blood or marriage relationships to him More than half of the men in the army and navy claim that they have no dependents for whom allotment of pay is compulsory or for whom they wish to make a voluntary allotment Some of these no doubt will be found to have a wife or child for whom they seek to evade responsibility and such wife or child or someone on their behalf should make application direct to the bureau if they do not receive the allotment and the man will be brought to ac count If an allotment is made for any beneficiary and through inadvertence or otherwise no request has been made for a family allowance the wife child or beneficiary or someone on their behalf should apply to this bureau for the family allowance Some will later want to make voluntary allotments for Class B dependents when perhaps they find it more convenient to do so Class B 57THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY dependents for whom the allotment is voluntary include parents brothers sisters and grandchildren Parents include fathers and mothers through adoption as well as natural parents and grand parents and stepparents either of the person in the service or of the spouse Brothers and sisters include those of the half blood and stepbrothers and stepsisters and brothers and sisters through adoption Even if Class B dependents are in want an enlisted man is not compelled to make an allotment for their support but he must do so before the government will pay any family allowance to them The allowance in all cases both for Class A and Class B de pendents is granted only when applied for after the required allot ment of pay has been made The monthly compulsory allotment is 15 for class A dependents where such exist whether a family allowance is applied for or not Where a man has Class A dependents but no Class B depend ents and has allotted 15 per month the government grants on ap plication a family allowance according to the following schedule For a wife but no child 15 a wife and one child 25 a wife and two children 3250 with 5 per month additional for each addi tional child up to a total of 50 which is the maximum govern ment allowance to the dependents Classes A and B of any one man under all circumstances no wife but one child 5 two chil dren 1250 three children 20 four children 30 and 5 for each additional child These allowances to Class A dependents are made without reference to dependency or need except that they may be waived by a wife who gives evidence of sufficient means for her own support but may not be waived by a child and a man may be exempted in certain exceptional circumstances from making a compulsory allotment When a man in the service has Class A dependents for whom he is making an allotment and in addition has Class B dependents for whom he wants an allowance he must make an additional allot ment of 5 Class B dependents receive allowances as follows One parent 10 two 20 each grandchild brother or sister or additional parent 5 provided the total family allowance for Classes A and B dependents for one person does not exceed 50 per month As there are no compulsory allotments for a woman in the service her dependents are always Class B dependents For Class 58WAR RISK INSURANCE B dependents where there are no Class A dependents men and women alike in the service must allot if they want allowances for their Class B dependents 15 per month In the case of a woman the family allowances for a husband and children are the same as in the case of a man for a wife and children except that dependency must be proven to exist as in the case of Class B dependents Class B allowances are subject to two conditions 1 The per son receiving the allowance must need it and be dependent in whole or in part for support upon the person making the allotment They need not be wholly dependent They may have earnings of their own or also other sources of support 2 The total of the allotment and the allowance paid to the dependents must not exceed the amount of the habitual contribution from the man to the de pendents in all cases where dependency existed prior to enlistment or prior to October 6 1917 Otherwise the government allowance will be proportionately reduced The bureau in its regulations made under the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury has sought to interpret this provision of the law in a broad and sympathetic way The regulation which defines dependency says For the purposes of the War Risk Insurance Act a person is dependent in whole or in part upon another when he is compelled to rely and the relations be tween the parties are such that he has a right to rely in whole or in part on the other for his support Also if a Class B dependent for whom a family allowance is claimed becomes dependent in whole or in part on the enlisted man subsequent to both enlistment and October 6 1917 the limitation as to habitual contributions is regarded as not applicable and the family allowance is paid without regard to it Family allowances are payable for one month after a man is discharged from the service but are not provided for more than one year after the termination of the war The conditions of dependency and habitual contribution make investigation necessary to prevent fraud and adjustment to the changing conditions affecting dependents such as births and deaths in the family children reaching the age of eighteen or contracting marriage before that age and economic conditions affecting the family income of the greatest complexity and difficulty in maintain ing the necessary records in the War Risk Bureau in order that awards may be made promptly and allowances paid accurately each month 59THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY as they become due Severe penalties are provided for intentional fraud Anyone knowingly making a false statement of a material fact in connection with claims under the act is guilty of perjury and will be punished by a fine up to 5000 or by imprisonment up to two years or both A beneficiary whose right to payments under the act ceases and who fraudulently accepts such payments thereafter will be punished by a fine up to 2000 or by imprisonment up to one year or both II COMPENSATION FOR DEATH OR DISABILITY The application of the principles of mutuality and insurance to the risk of death or disability resulting from personal injury suf fered or disease contracted in the line of duty and not due to wilful misconduct on the part of the injured person is not new It has been successfully tried out on a large scale through the admirable workings of the national and state workmens compensation laws now operative for the civilian employes of the federal government and for the industrial workers of thirtysix states of the American Union These laws have largely displaced or superceded the old employers liability remedies for industrial accidents They have proven themselves to be increasingly satisfactory to employers and employes alike They operate also to place on each industry the cost of the financial burden of its unavoidable industrial accidents as far as that burden can be translated into dollars and cents They operate to distribute among the consumers of the goods produced the cost of industrial accidents incurred in their produc tion to the extent of providing for the payment of a sum propor tionate to the loss of earning power and a fair recompense for the suffering that an industrial accident causes the individual workman and his family They also operate to encourage industry to adopt and develop every possible safety device for the elimination of preventable accidents The analogy of this industrial experience with compensation remedies to the problem of caring for the hazards of war is plain In the case of our military and naval forces the industry is an extra hazardous one the payments for compensation must be liberal and the cost will be heavy The government of the United States is the employer and the nation or the people of the United States are the consumers or those for whom the operations of war are 60WAR RISK INSURANCE carried on The government therefore should bear the whole cost of compensation for death or disability for officers as well as for en listed men and for members of the nurse corps female and dis tribute the burden through taxation It does not require any con tribution from the beneficiaries as it does in the case of allotments of pay upon which family allowances are based or in the case of premiums covering the peace rates for insurance The soldier or sailor does his part when he risks his life and bears the unavoidable personal suffering from injury or disease incurred in the service of his country Compensation is a payment in addition to regular pay family allowances and insurance benefits and serves to equal ize the burdens and risks of military service which inevitably are unequally distributed between those called upon to serve in front line trenches as compared with those serving in no less necessary operations behind the lines This second great service of the War Risk Insurance Law which makes provision for compensation for death and disability is neces sarily a complicated and technical one and I cannot attempt here to describe it fully but only in its general outlines It is more liberal and far more just than any pension law that has ever been passed or now exists and it should make any supplementary pension legis lation for those engaged in this war wholly unnecessary While it will cost the government huge sums of money depending upon the number of men engaged in this war the length of the war and the severity of our casualties it will doubtless cost less be far more just and equitable in its benefits and give more aid and comfort where it is needed than any general pension scheme could possibly provide Compensation for death or disability is provided for all mem bers of the United States military and naval forces including not only enlisted men but also commissioned officers and members of the army and navy nurse corps female The only person entitled to receive compensation for disability is the man himself In the case of his death the widow child dependent mother and dependent father receive the benefits provided Compensation is not paid automatically but must be applied for on blank forms furnished by the Bureau of War Risk Insurance It varies in amounts from 30 to 100 a month paid to the disabled man and from 20 to 75 a month paid to his widow child dependent mother or dependent father 61THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY Unlike industrial compensation the amount does not vary in proportion to the wage or previous income of the disabled person or of the deceased It is based on a new principle namely that of the family need on the theory that under the conscription law the fam ily is conscripted when the bread winner is taken away There fore the amount paid if the man is disabled in the line of duty varies according to the size of his family and changes from month to month or year to year as the family status changes If a man is a bachelor and is totally disabled he gets 30 a month if he has a wife but no child living 45 a month a wife and one child 55 a wife and two children 65 a wife and three or more children 75 no wife but one child living 40 with 10 for each additional child up to two a mother or father either or both dependent upon him for support in addition to the above amounts 10 for each He is entitled in addition to free medical surgical and hospital service and supplies including artificial limbs etc as the Director of the War Risk Bureau may determine to be useful and reasonably necessary and for certain claims of disability such as the loss of both feet or hands or both eyes he gets in lieu of all other compen sation the fiat sum of 100 a month Partial disability is pro rated at a percentage of the compensation for total disability equal to the degree of the reduction in earning capacity resulting from the disability In case of death resulting from injury in the line of duty the monthly compensation paid is as follows For the widow alone 25 for the widow and one child 35 for the widow and two children 4250 with 5 for each additional child up to two if there be no widow then for one child 20 for two children 30 for three children 40 with 5 for each additional child up to two for a de pendent mother or dependent father 20 or both 30 except that the amount paid to a dependent mother or dependent father or both when added to the total amount payable to the wife and children shall not exceed 75 Compensation is payable for the death of but one child No compensation is paid to a dependent mother on ac count of a child if she is already in receipt of compensation on account of the death of her husband Compensation is further limited by the following considerations None is paid if the injury or disease was caused by the mans own wilful misconduct None is paid for death or disability occurring 62WAR RISK INSURANCE later than one year after the man leaves the service unless a medical examination at the time of his resignation or discharge or within one year thereafter proves that the man was then suffering from an injury or disease likely to cause death or disability later None is paid for death inflicted as punishment for crime or military offence unless inflicted by the enemy None is paid unless the claim is filed within five years after the death was recorded in the depart ment in which the man was serving at the time of his death or in case of death after discharge or resignation from service within five years after death None is paid for disability unless the claim is filed within five years after discharge or resignation from the service or within five years after the beginning of disability occurring after leaving the service None is paid for any period more than two years prior to the date of claim None is paid during the period in which the man is reported as missing if during that time his pay and family allowance go on a man is not considered dead until reported so by the department under which he is serving None is paid to those receiving service or retirement pay Dishonorable discharge terminates the right to the compensa tion Compensation is not assignable and is exempt from attach ment execution and from all taxation and the law providing for gratuity of payments for death in the service and all existing pension laws does not apply to persons in the active service at the time of the passage of this act or to those entering into the active service after or to their widows children or dependents except in so far as rights under such laws shall have heretofore accrued In addition to the benefits mentioned there is provision for the payment by the United States of burial expenses not to exceed 100 The com pensation to a widow or widowed mother ceases upon her remarriage and to a child when it reaches the age of 18 years or marries unless the child be incapable because of insanity idiocy or being otherwise permanently helpless in which case it continues during such inca pacity In the interpretation of the compensation provision the Bureau of War Risk Insurance has endeavored to be as liberal as the spirit of the law permits An illustration of this is found in the definition by regulation of the term total disability which is defined as an impairment of the mind or body which renders it impossible for the disabled person to follow a gainful occupation and again in 63THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY the regulation which says that total disability is deemed to be permanent whenever it is founded upon conditions which render it reasonably certain that it will continue throughout the life of the person suffering from it In addition to providing compensation for disability and death the government promises in this act to do everything in its power to restore a man who has been injured by accident or diseases incurred in the line of duty to the fullest possible physical and economic power The people of the United States do not want this war to produce a large crop of corner loafers that is men who will come back injured more or less seriously by their war experience and without ambition to rely upon what the government will do for them and consider that it owes them a living They will be far happier if they can be restored in part if not in whole to their previ ous earning ability and have found for them some new occupation which they can successfully pursue even though maimed and im paired in physical powers Courses of education and rehabilita tion will be provided by the United States Already rehabilitation work and vocational training have been begun by the Surgeon General of the Army and by the Surgeon General of the Navy who make provision for bedside instruction and training during convalescence until the men are discharged from the service The Vocational Rehabilitation Act of June 27 1918 makes provisions whereby the Federal Board for Vocational Education is authorized and directed to furnish where vocational rehabilitation is feasible such courses as it may prescribe to every person who is disabled under circumstances entitling him after dis charge from the military or naval forces of the United States to compensation under the War Risk Insurance Act While taking such courses the injured person receives monthly compensation equal to the amount of his monthly pay for the last month of his active serv ice or equal to the amount of his compensation under the War Risk Insurance Act whichever amount is the greater and in the case of an enlisted man his family receives compulsory allotment and family allowance in the same way as provided for enlisted men in active service It also authorizes the bureau to withhold the pay ment of compensation during the period of any wilful failure to follow any prescribed course of rehabilitation or to submit to medi cal examination whenever required to do so or to enlist in any 64WAR RISK INSURANCE service established for the purpose of rehabilitation reeducation or vocational training The board may also pay additional ex penses where necessary to enable injured men to follow successfully its prescribed courses of rehabilitation III INSURANCE AGAINST DEATH AND PERMANENT AND TOTAL DISABILITY AS ADDED PROTECTION The third great national service provided for the military and naval forces by the War Risk Insurance Bureau is intended to cop per rivet the protection afforded by the other twoallotments and family allowances and compensation and indemnity It is what is generally known as annual renewable term insurance with prem iums paid monthly It is voluntary but may be taken by officers enlisted men and members of the army or navy nurse corps fe male in amounts of not less than 1000 in multiples of 500 up to a maximum of 10000 Its chief purpose is to restore the in surability which a man in prime physical condition who passes the medical tests required for active military or naval service either loses or finds impaired when he enters such service This lost or impaired insurability is restored by giving him the opportunity to buy insurance at peace rate cost renewable from year to year and convertible into any of the ordinary forms of insurance within five years after the end of the war without physical examination The premium rates are based upon the American Experience Table of Mortality and interest at 34 per cent per annum and rep resent the actual cost of the insurance not including administra tive expenses which the government bears or any loading for solicitors commissions advertising inspection or medical examina tions The extra hazard of the war risk is created by the govern ments call to service and it properly bears that cost also Therefore the man gets insurance in an extra hazardous occu pation at less cost than the same form of insurance would cost him in peace times in any commercial insurance organization He has 120 days after enlistmentor entering the service in which to elect to take the insurance and to decide upon the amount he wants After that time he may drop any part of his insurance he does not want to carry but may not increase his policy The insurance is in force immediately the signed application is mailed or delivered and even a formal application is not necessary as the bureau recog 65THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY nizes any written application which sufficiently identifies the ap plicant and specifies the amount desired The acceptance is of course conditioned upon the man passing his physical examination and being admitted to the active service if that is not already the case Premiums may be and usually are paid automatically by monthly allotment of pay The rates during the war run from 63 cents per month per thousand dollars of insurance at the age of fif teen to 335 at the age of sixtyfive increasing annually upon the anniversary of the policy to the age rate for the next age year The insurance will run as long as the premiums are paid whether the man leaves the service or not provided it is converted into permanent forms of insurance within five years after the close of the war unless it is terminated by the discharge or dismissal of any person from the military or naval forces on the ground that he is an enemy alien conscientious objector or a deserter or as guilty of mutiny treason spying or any offense involving moral turpitude or wilful and persistent misconduct The amount of the policy in the event of death or total and permanent disability is payable in 240 monthly instalments ex cept that if the insured is permanently and totally disabled and lives longer than 240 months payments continue at that rate as long as he lives and is so disabled and in the event of his death before 240 payments have been made the remaining monthly instalments go to his beneficiary In the event of death before any or all of the 240 payments have been made the insurance is payable likewise in monthly in stalments to any beneficiary designated by the insured within a limited class consisting of a spouse child grandchild parent brother or sister as defined above in the case of allotments allow ances and compensation If no beneficiary within the permitted class is designated by the insured or if the designated one does not survive the insured the payments go to such persons within the permitted class of beneficiaries as would be entitled under the laws of the state of the residence of the insured to his personal property in case of intestacy If no such person survive the insured then there shall be paid to the estate of the insured an amount equal to the reserve value if any of the insurance at the time of his death calculated on the basis of the American Experience Table of Mor 66WAR RISK INSURANCE tality and 3 per centum interest in fu o ll of all obligations under the contract of insurance There are no other provisions for lump sum payments The insurance payments are further protected however by the pro vision which applies also to payments for allotments and family allowances and compensations that they are not assignable nor subject to the claims of creditors of any person to whom an award is made except claims of the United States against the person on whose account the allotments and family allowances compensa tion or insurance is payable The act of October 6 1917 contained a very wise provision for automatic insurance whereby all men in the active service on or after April 6 1917 the date when war was declared who during the 120 day period immediately following the date of publication of the terms of the contract of insurance Oct 15 1917 were totally and permanently disabled or died without having applied for insurance were to be deemed to have applied for and to have been granted insurance payable to such person during his life in monthly instalments of 25 each This was about the equivalent of 4500 of insurance In the event of death how ever the payments of the balance of 240 such payments to bene ficiaries were restricted to a widow remaining unmarried a child or a widowed mother This restriction was amended June 25 1918 so that the beneficiary might be a widow during her widowhood or if there is no widow surviving then to the child or children of the insured or if there is no child surviving him then to his mother or if there is no mother surviving him then to his father if and while they survive him This provision was made retroactive and the bureau was directed to revise all awards of automatic insurance in accordance with its terms on July 1 1918 The appreciation on the part of the men and women in the military and naval forces of the benefits of this voluntary insurance is abundantly shown by the fact that over twentythree billion dol lars of insurance have been applied for and over 95 per cent of the entire army and navy is covered by it in amounts averaging nearly 85 per cent per person of the maximum allowed The voluntary insurance feature of the War Risk Insurance Act superadded to the compensation and allotments and allow ances constitutes one logical and farreaching scheme to promote 67THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY and protect the welfare and morale of our fighting forces whether abroad or at home It is a governmental undertaking of the great est magnitude and importance and one in which every American may take just pride Almost automatic in its operation it is a selfrespecting wellbalanced and democratic expression of a new sense of social solidarity and unity of national purpose EIGHT MONTHS OF WAR RISK INSURANCE WORK BY LIEUTCOL S H WOLFE1 Quartermaster Corps United States Army Shortly after the United States entered the war it was felt that a more detailed knowledge was desired of relief measures re quired by modern war conditions Canada was visited and the results of my investigation have been published as Bulletin No 10 Miscellaneous Series Childrens Bureau Department of Labor The realization of the necessity for doing away with haphazard methods and of substituting therefor a scientific program of govern ment relief led the Secretary of War to direct me to prepare a system of relief for the dependents of enlisted men in our armya question which was then being considered by the members of the cabinet forming the Council of National Defense and by the Secretary of the Treasury The various steps leading to the preparation of the War Risk Insurance Act are matters of record and it is unnecessary to refer to them at length The act was enacted by Congress was approved October 6 1917 and became effective November 1 In a little over three weeks therefore the bureau was called upon to prepare for the handling of a proposition

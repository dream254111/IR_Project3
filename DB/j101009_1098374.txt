of the State thereby interfered with See 3 Va Law Reg 831 TRESPASSING ON PUBLIC HIGHWAYThat one may trespass on a public high way in which the public has only the easement of passage is strikingly shown in the recent English case of Hickenson v Maisey 1900 1 Q B 752 We take the following statement of the case from the Canada Law Journal The plaintiff was possessed of land traversed by a highway A trainer of horses had agreed with the plaintiff for the use of some of his land for the train ing and trial of race horses A view of the land so used could be obtained from the highway on the plaintiffs land The defendant was one of the proprietors of a paper which published accounts of the doings of race horses and for the pur pose of getting information as to the performances of horses being trained on the plaintiffs land the defendant walked backwards and forwards on the highway on the plaintiffs land about fifteen yards in length for about an hour and a half1900 NOTES OF CASES 269 watching and taking notes of the trials of race horses on the plaintiffs land The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for trespass in thus using the highway and the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff and Day J who tried the action gave judgment for the plaintiff and granted an injunction to restrain further trespass by the defendant On appeal from that judgment the Court of Appeal Smith Collins and Romer L JJ following Harrison v Rutland 1893 1 Q B 142 affirmed the decision ANTICIPATORY BREACH OF CONTRACTIn Roehm v Horst 20 Sup Ct 780 in which was involved the anticipatory breach of contracts it is said  But there are many cases in which before the time fixed for performance one of the con tracting parties may do that which amounts to a breach and filrnishes a ground of damages It has always been the law that where a party deliberately incapacitates himself or renders performance of his contract impossible his act amounts to an injury to the other party which gives the other party a cause of action for breach of contract yet this would seem to be inconsistent with the reasoning in Daniels v Newton 114 Mass 530 though it is not there in terms decided that an abso lute refusal to perform a contract after the time and under the conditions in which plaintiff is entitled to require performance is not a breach of the contract even although the contract is by its terms to continue in the future Parcer v Russell 133 Mass 74 In truth the opinion goes upon a distinction between cases of renunciation before the arrival of the time of performance and those of renunciation of un matured obligations of a contract while it is in course of performance and it is said that before the argument on the ground of convenience and mutual advan tage to the parties can properly have weight the point to be reached must first be shown to be consistent with logical deductions from the strictly legal aspects of the case We think that there can be no controlling distinction on this point between the two classes of cases and that it is proper to consider the reasonableness of the conclusion that the absolute renunciation of particular contracts constitutes such a breach as to justify immediate action and recovery therefor The parties to a contract which is wholly executory have a right to the maintenance of the con tractual relations up to the time for performance as well as to a performance of the contract when due If it appear that the party who makes an absolute refusal intends thereby to put an end to the contract so far as performance is concerned and that the other party must accept this position why should there not be speedy action and settlement in regard to the rights of the parties  Why should a locus poenitentice be awarded to the party whose wrongful action has placed the other at such disadvantage What reasonable distinction per se is there between liability for a refusal to perform future acts to be done under a contract in course of per formance and liability for a refusal to perform the whole contract made before the time for commencement of performance As Lord Chief Justice Cockburn observed in Frost v Knight L R 7 Exch 111 the promisee has the right to insist on the contract as subsisting and effective before the arrival of the time for its performance and its unimpaired and unim peached efficacy may be essential to his interests dealing as he may with rights

Read 25th February 1839 IT was not until I llad arrived at Wadi Halfah at the second or great cataract of the Nile in lat z2 N that I finally resolvel to pene trate into the BeledesSudEn countries of the Blacks and even then I dicl not anticipate prosecuting my journey beyond the ruins of Musawwerat in the neighbourhood of Shendi or at the utmost to Ihartum Proboscis the seat of the Pashtis government for the provinces to the south of the second cataract The sequel will show that I visited Sennar and then proceeled to the west to E1 Obeid the capital of Wordofan In the afternoon of December 5th 1Ss36 having enfflaged ca mels at 35 piastres each l left Wadi IIalfah accompaniel by HAji Suleiman my interpreter and Ali an inferior lomestic anl having crossed the Nile determined to take the road on its west bank to New Dongola Donkolah  Our route lay through Abusir Tahti Kagmi Semneh Askur Melikennasr anl Okmeh all small villages consisting of only a few huts at this latter place there is a hot saline spring close to the river it is alout 4 miles S from the village A small quaelrangular burnt larick ruin without either door or windoss but with an opening at the top now nearly closed by the drifted sanl shows that this was in all proloability anciently used as a bath At the back of this building is the principal spring which is so close to the elge of the river that it must be concealel during the inuntlation The temperature of this water at its source is 130 of Fahrenheit Smaller and more insignificant springs ooze through the ground on each siele of the principal one to the distance of 250 paces anl the saline matter left ly the e7aporation gave the bank a frosty appearance The peasants ofOlimeh have an ilea that the hot spring comes unler grounel from the Oasis of Selimall 70 miles to the W where there is abundance of muriate of soda in a state of great purity and I afterXarls askel an inteligent cameldriver who had made many excursions to Selimah at what point he thought he shouXl come upon the Nile if he travelel elue E from Sel imah antl he replied at  Okmell This is strongly corroborative of the position of Selimah lail down by Mr W G Browne anl of its positionrelative to Okmeh as given in lIr John Arrowsmiths ma From Okmeh we passed through Da1 Sakiyet el Abt Deir Hamil Setlaenga roshe Sc leil Koyeh Tinareh Gurgol Saesa Maraliol

New Donkolah which I reached at noon on the 22nd of December The journey is usually performed in ten days but I stopped on the road to examine a11 the antiquarian remains Utrdeh Agi Marvikaht or New Donkolah for it is known by all these names has sprung into a place of importance within the last twelve years The population is estimated at 6000 including 800 troops their wives and families an estimate which appearel to me much too high The number of Copts is about 100 The bazar is daily increasing and is supplied from Cairo the principal articles brought from thence being shoes printed cottons calicoes sugar rice cloth hardware c The duties upon goods entering New Donkolah are heavy so that articles of consumption are dear in many instances treble or quadruple what they are in Cairo Donkolah can boast of a coSeehouse The government is at present building baths and there is alreaely a large manufactory for indigo The thermometer on Christmas day stood in the shade at 2 PM at 86 and at 8 PM at 80 The position of New Donkolah as statel by M Linant is 1S 7 30 N lat and 29 54 35 long E of Greenurich The town is placed on the edge of the river the banks of shich when the water is lowest are abollt 25 feet high and I shoulel think that the Nile rises here about 18 or 20 feet On the 31st of December having procured a boat I left New Donkolah and on the afternoon of the 3rd January 1837 I reached Old Donkolah The town is in ruins and does not contain a population of more than 3Q0 The most striking object here is a mosque on ratller an elevated site from the to of which there is an extensive prospect of the arid Desert and meandering Nile The sand is of a very bright yellow colour and has accumulated in such quantities as in 1nany places to conceal the houses its surface being level with their roofs anl the entrance tl the apartments being through the ceiling of the rooms There is no land capable of cultivation near the ruined town in short almost all the east bank of the river between Oll and New Donkolah is covered with drifted sand anl rare is it to see even a few feet of cultivable soil Our direction from Okl Donkolah was SE then due E until near Ambukol whence we traveiled a few miles a point to the N of E The only object of interest in the neighbourhool of Ambukol is a portion of desert near the river about 8 miles W of the village This waste is called Haaybarlak The superficial stratum here is a coarse sandstone curious and interesting from its  The collrt a Turkish termFS  Calital of lne of the ancient ecclesiastical divisions of

siliceous fossil trees I observed five or six the largest of which situated 20 minutes walk from the river is 51 feet in length and 20 inclles in diameter at its largest ex tremity It is lartially buried in the sand The peasantry splinter off fragments and use them for gunflints and tc strike a light It appeared to me that these fossils were d6mtrees Cucifera Thebaica On the 8th of January I arrivel at Amloukol and a severe attack of fever arrested lny progress until the 24th when being sufficiently recovered I resolsed to cross the desert of E3ayudah to Khartum a route I beieve not previously passed by any Euro peantraveller Thermometer 75 I engagedcamelsat 25piastres eacll from Ambukol to KhartCm My first days journey was short as first days journeys always are in the East and I rested for the night after travelling 2w hours at a place to which the Arabs have given the name of Berj el kuran Koran tower On the 25th I travelled 71 hours and resteel at Khorel ghanim On the 26th 9 hours to AlJu Samud On the 27th in 3 hours we reached the wells of Bayudah Many wells have been sunk but we found water only in three and in very small quantities The water is good free from any brackish taste thick and of a deep yellow colour deriving these latter properties from the soil through which it passes The water which we had brought from the Nile was putrid and nauseous anl we were glad to avail ourselves of the opportunity of procuring a fresh supply We were delayed several hours in taking a small quantity the wells having been visitel during the morning before we arrived by Arabs who had drawn largely upon the springs for tlleir goats sheep asses and camels These are the orlly wells between Ambukol and E1 Hajir the latter the point at which we met the Nile again In the afternoon we resumed our journey crossed a small ascent of about 70 feet and rested for the night after 3 hours at KhorelLaban The distance on the 27th six hours 18 miles On the 28thn 81 hours to Ks Abu Deluah On the 29th 7 hours to E1 Atherleh On the 30th 8 hours to E1 Gharah On the 31st in 31 hours we arrived at the Nile leaving the Desert letween two rocky hills E1 Hajir about 150 feet high on the right and JebalelRoyan situated on an island of the same name about 250 feet high on our left I crossed the desert of Bayudah as I have shown between Ambukol and E1 Hajir anl the journey is usually lerformed in seven days though it might with ease be made in sis It is flat with few hills and those small and of easy ascent After leaving Ambukol the surface is alternately sand and gravel but the sub  4 from its whitenessF S n t N 2166 Mr HOLROYDS Journewy to Kordofan  1837 stratum is sandstone and continues to be such till within an hour of reaching Abil Samud wherc we came upon grey granite fur rowel by veins of primitisTe quartz The gravel both to the AIr and S of Abu Samufl contains quartz peblles in great aloun dance and I noticed also portions of siliceous fossil trees similar to those observed at Haagbarlak At Abu Samud the wells of Bay Ildah and in short as far as E1 Hajir sandstone occurs with only one exception where a vein of rel granite crossed from W to E between these two latter places I observed occasionally stones of a yellowish grey colour spotted with black points resemlling those which are thrown up by Vesusius during its eruptions I also found abllndance of fragmexlts of hard sanlstone containing quartzose pebbles wllich were in patches andat no great lis tance from each other The patches of stones of a grey cclour which appearel volcanic were at least 40 or 50 miles from the hills and though they appeared to have been deposited after some volcanic convulsion we were unable to discover any ex tinct volcano the sand dves not drift much in this desert I also occasionally found hard black cinders It is however re narkable that these isolated patches are found at so great a distance from the mountains At 8 hours S of Ambukol we came upon patches where water had collected during the periodical rains and upon looking at the map I observed that Mr Arrow smith had laid down their northern limits very correctly The desert of Bayudah abounds in herbaceous plants and one or two varieties of the mimosa It also possesses many objects of great interest in the zoological kingdom especially the leopard orys and gazelle Its few inhabitants belong to the tribe of Kababish Aralas In 2 hours and 40 minutes we halted for the night at Jagjoke Feb 1 We travelled E3 hours and 40 minutes to Kerreri On the following day in 4 hours we arrived at the northern point of the White Nile Nil el Abyad on which we embarked anl in less than an hour arrived at Khartum The direction from Ambukol to E1 Hajir was from NW to SE and the distance occupied us 52 hours march nvhich at 22 miles per hour would gi7e us 130 miles from E1 Hajir to Khartum from N to S folloving the course of the river 16 hours 20 minutes or about 42 miles The position of the junction of the Bahr el Abyad or White River with the Bahr elAzrak or Blue Rirer in the observations given me by M Linant is 15 34 40tt N and Si 11 25t E of Gr These oleservations do not agree

undertook the construction of my map pointed out the discrepancy between these observations and we immediately saw M Linant on the subject when he told us that he considered the list fllrnished to me from which I took all the fised points to lbe the most leserving of reliance because he carefully looked over and correctetl his observations after his return to Cairo and subsequently to his sending his paers to the African Association Khartum the Proboscis is situated on the W bank of the Blue River alvout 11 mile from its junction with the Bahr el AlJyad It is the seat of government of the Beledessudan and the present governor is Khurshid Pasha It was a small village shen A1ohammed Ali suledued the kingdom but has risen rapidly into importance at the expense of Shendi and Sennar and is now a place of considerable trade being convenient as a rendezvous for the slavecaravans from Abyssinia Sennctlr anal Kordofan It contains 15000 inhabitants including about 1600 solliers and their families Parts of it are regularly built Many of the houses are large and isolated enclosed by a garden They as well as Ihurshid Pashas palace which is by no means strik ing are built of sunburnt bricks The buzars are irregular small and confined and when the troops are absent extremely ill supplied The principal articles of consumption are shoes calicoes printed goods suvar rice broad cloth pistolbelts saldles worked saldlecloths a little tea crockery hardsare qnishmisht kamaraddatn  Ac an3 a corlsiderablJle trade in sla es is carried on both by auction and prisate contract Just outside the bazAr is the market for vegetables bread fruit sugarcane butter dates grain straw grease for the heal c c Alld here stands the fraxne to which criminals are suspentled when ese cuted complete with rings and accommodation for three persons The land upon which Khartum is built as well as that wllich surrounds the town is rich allus7ial soil similar to the deposit of the Nile The ground is flat anl without trees The banks of the river at the season of lov water are about 30 feet in height and I should think from their appearance that the average lise of the river here is about 20 feet During this my first stay at Khartuln the mercury in the thermoineter never stood in the daytime below 7S but on the 10th of February it rose to 90 Feb l l I left Khartum to proceel 1lp the Blue River Ehurshid Pasha having pros7ided me with an excellent boat  Voliip171Lollg3241tis adopted in themapfromBrucesobservationsat Halfayeh t Dried apricot  The pulp of apricots spread out and driedfor that purpose and on the lSth I arrived at Abfi Kharraz on the E bank and at the junction of the Rahal an eastern tri butary stream about half a mile wide of blue water and rapid current Here is a village of considerable size and a station of 300 Moghrebi cavalry Most of the houses are of straw of a circular forms and resembling cornstacks There are only one or two of sunburnt brick and the largest of these is that of the kashif There is a market here daily the wares are scanty in small quantity and of inferior quality On the same day I crossed the river to Wad Mellnah and in an hour reached a military post here one battalion of 800 men is sta tioned ISere is a laily market small and ill supplied with articles of a very coarse description There are two lare bazars hell in the neighbourhood of Wad Medinah weekly that to the northward is at Salemiyah the other to the SW at Sorribah To the latter I went on the 16th The village is situated about 6 miles from the river and the roal to it is over a rich plain Dhurrah millet or sorghum is culti vatel round it in patches after the kharif or rainy season is over Iut for want of capital and labour by far the greater proportion of the soil lies idle This market was well attended principally by Belowins and the rares exposed for sale much better than those at AlJu Kharraz and WAd Medinah The banks of the river at Wil Medinah are about the same height as those of Khartum and I should think that the rise of the Nile is in the same yropor tion Thermometer at Wad Medinah Feb 16 88 On the 1 7th I left Wad Medirlah and at 4 PM on the Glst I had moored my boat immediately below SennEr I took up my quarters in a house in the barracks provided for me by the mili tary commandant and I was hardly settled in my new haloitation before the peasantry flocked in numbers with their manufactures to entleavour to seduce me into becoming a purchaser Among their wares were mats with beautiful devices made of split lom Cucifera ThelJaica leaves and dyed of various colours conical straw covers for plates in elegant patterns silver zerfs stanls for coSeecups in filagree warlike weapons spears knives c and lastly hegabart or amulets for security from every kind of disease and casualty including the fatal fever of the country and the voracious jaws of the crocodile A small bazar is held daily at Sennar and the principal articles for sale are butchers meat grease oil tobacco dhurrah bilbil and merisah  but on Mondays and Thursdays a market attended by persons for many 1niles round is held at Kadero a village to the S Of Sennar about 1  mile from it and between it and Jebel Mowil That held on Mondays is the largest and best supplied Near the place where the daily bazar of Sennar is held is a mosque  Bilbil and merisah re kinds of beer made from fermented dhurrah 168 Mr HOLROYDS Journey to Kordofan 18371837 Wad Medinah Senncir 169 adjoining to which may be traced the foundations of the palace now no longer existing of the last sultan and near it is a coSee house the favourite resort of the military officers and fashionables of this capital The banks of the river at Sennar are between 40 and 50 feet high The Nile rises about 20 feet The country around is dull uninteresting and flat with the e2ception of Jebel Mowil a hill about 800 feet high six miles SW by S of the town Scarcely a tree is to be seen except in the distance towards the S To the N S and E are villages about 20 miles oR Theinhabitants of Sennar are of a darkbrown colour The women are lighter than the men and both are llandsome The latter wear drawers and a cotton shirt reaching to their ankles or a fold of cotton round the waist anl afterwards thrown loosely over the shoulder Most of them wear rosaries of black seeds of ebony or other wooden beals round their necks They al most all have a purse suspended from the neck hegabart or amulets on the right arm above the elbow and a knife on the left in the same situation Some wear leather ornaments round the ankles They generally allow their hair to grow and do not wear the Takiyeh or white skullcap The women wear a fold of cotton round their bolies thrown afterwards over the shoulders and sometimes covering the heal also The unmarried girs and slaves usually wear only a rahat or leather fringe round the waist Their hair is plaited into tresses about the thickness of rats tails and this operation of plaiting is preceded by the destruction of the parasites which abound in these localities a massacre which they carry on against those insects every fortnight or three weeks The head is then dressed and loaded with three or four pounds of muttonsuet or camels fat Some of the women wear silver earrings all neck laces of glass beals and most of them an immense bunxh of hegabart suspended from the neck They also ornarnent them selves with bracelets of silver of rings of horn or ivory plain or slightly alorned with black spots leather ornaments on the wrists and ankles and I noticed a ifew who hal a ring or beads passel through a perforation in the right nostril but this was by no means common Both men anl women have gool teeth In many the gums are black or lrown deriving this peculiarity from their admixture with the negroes Many of the women allow the nails on the fingers of the left hand to grow to an extraordinary length an inch or more beyonl the tip of the finger similar to the women and grandees in China They however pare the nails of the right hand as the not doing so would interfere they said with their custom of eating with their fingers Most of tlle lower orders possess one or two slaves170 Mr DIOLRO1LDS Journey to Kordofan L1837 The neighbourhood of SennEr is interesting to tlle naturalist A very great variety of animals and birds are to lJe found durinZ the kharif or rainy season anl when the dhurrah is ripe At all times the crested crane abounds as well as seseral other species of cranes storks eagles anlvultures I observed great numbers of wild guineafowls and lnany varieties of ducks and geese Elephants hippopotami and crocodiles are in great abundance During my stay at Sennar the thermometer never stood lower than 88 anl on the 27th anl 28th of February it rose to 94 March 2 At 5 AM I took my deyarture from Sennar ly the Nile at 10 AM on the Sth I arrived again at Wad Medinah and in the afternoon of the 9th I left it in order to proceed to Afonkarah near Wad Shellai on the White Nile In 1 hour and 40 minutes from Wad Medinah we reached the village of E1 Bessatner and in 1 hour and 10 minutes more we arrived at E1 Leiweh where we rested for the night March 10 In 2 hours to Hegligah and in 3 hours more to Abut This tract is a dead level with a soil of the richest quality but from want of capital anl paucity of inhabitants llttle of lt 1S cultlvateds and that only lurng thc ramy season The peasarltry are content to raise a crop of dhurrah sufficient to answer the demands of the government antl tv maintain them selves during the year The water of Abut is good and whole some Thermometer 90 March 11In 5 hours we arrived at Monakil and took a meal of sour milk pastry and honey with a Turkish soldier kaimmakaxn or governor of the village A market hell here every Sunday is better attellded than any other in the neighbour hood The water of Monakil is slightly impregnated with iron but by no means unpalatable In 5 hours from hence we ar rised at the small village of E1 FAkirkir X a mile frozn which are wells of good water Our journey today was 10 hours March 12In 1 hour and EO minutes from E1 Fakirkirwe arrived at the wells of Emmdakkat where the water is sliglltly brackish though not so much so as to be despised 3 hours xnore brought us to Egarina a village consisting of several huts but only three inhabited The water here also is brackish We left Egarin in the evening and after travelling 5 hours haltel for the night March 13 I resumed my journey at an early hourv and in 6 hours 15 minutes arrived at Monkarah with the thermometer at 93 Our general lirection from SNid Medlnah to Nlon karah was W  and the distance 86 miles The price we paid for each of our camels 121 piastres is 6d From Abut to Monakil the country is not cultivated but I am of opinion that in proper hanals it might lve made available1837 A butMonak z1Monkarah 171 for agricultural purposes From Monakil to Monkarah the lanl is of excellent quality vith the exception of a small strip about 7 miles distance from the latter place After having male several excursions into this lesert and crossed from Wad Me dinah to Monkarah I have colne to the conclusion with respect to the country from Jebel Mowll near Sennar to Alleis west ward and to Khartiim northward that the greatest portion if not the whole of this trianole is formed by the alluvial deposit of the Nile The soil of this desert if desert it may be callel is precisely similar to that near the banks of the river its surface is nearly a dead level there are no hills or mountains and the Nile even now rises during its increase to within 2 or 3 feet of the top of its banks on the Blue and White Rivers and in many parts of the latter where no banks exist it spreads itself over a large tract of country If a canal were cut from Wtid Medinah to Monkarah with lranches N and S almost all the land might be used for the proluction of cotton indigo tolacco sugar grain c Much might be accomplished by means of tanks for collecting the rainwater during the kharif and ly sink ing wells But still this would not suffice to irrigate the whole of this rich and valualJle lanl Between Wad Medinah anl Monkarah the country is beautifully studded with prickly acacias Monkarah is one of the Pashas boatbuilding stations There is abundance of wood in the neighloourhood but little of it is used as larger and better timber is found near Alleis or in the country of the Shilluks About thirty boats are built here an nllally I observed eighteen or twenty pairs of sawyers and five or six boats on the stocks The sawyers are negro slaves anl convicts The whole population may be 100 persons In travelling in this cotlntry it is alJsolutely necessary to pre vent the skin being exposed to the scorching rays of the sun or it is immediately attacked with swelling and inflawmmation Between Abut and Monkarah I was so imprudent as to lwide with my legs bare from the knees downward and when I arrived at the latter vil lage they were so swollen painful and inflamed that I was confinel to my bed several das before I was able to proceed to Kordofan On the morning of the 15th I crossed over from Monkarah to Eajebi a small settlement of Hasanlyeh Arabs on the W bank of the Nile and NW of the former place Here were also the tents of Suleiman Kaschif who was collecting the contributions from tlie villages in the neighbourhood During my stay at Wajebi a party of Shilluks arrived accompaniel by the son of their sultan This prince was dressed in a blue cotton shirt similar to those worn by the fellahs labourers in Egypt They were on their way to Ihartfim for the purpose of enleavouring to make terms of peace wvith Khurshid Pasha and addiIlg their dsminionstoMr HOLROYDS JOUTneY 0 Zordtofan 1837 172 those already subject to the Viceroy of Egypt a policy they thought it better to adoptthan to expose themselves to the armual or bien nial incursions of his troops for the purpose of seizing them as slaves I heard that subsequently to my leanng the BeledesSudan Khurshid Pasha had concltlded treaties with them and that they are now subject to Mohammed Ali These Shilluks were fine men none of them less than six feet high and many of them several inches taller They were clumsily formed their legs being too short for the size of tlle trunk The heads of some were shaved the hair of those unshorn was curled and woolly Their countenances were harsh and savage their cheekbones high and noses narrow near the root but broal and flattened to wards the nostrils Like the inhabitants of Denkah the incisors of their lower jaw had been extracted The only weapons they had with them were sticks shields and spears of a rude construc tion Some of them wore a single ring of ivory above the elbow of the right arm Their prince was distinguished from the others 1JY two large rings of solid silver which he wore as bracelets on his left wrist They indulge in smoking but not to excess They amused us one evening with several choruses and cajtches wthich they sang in a very pleasing manner keeping excellent time They are very expert sportsmen killing the crocodile and hippo potamus with the same spears which they use in selfdefence At Kajebi in a double tent the thermometer reached 112 on the l9th lMarch The west bank of the White River is occupied to the N ancl S of Kajebi by Hasaniyeh Arabs whose only other settlement which I observed was opposite Berber They are generally fine men a shade lighter than the Sennarese and their females not so dark as the males They are social lively and gay and their females particularly fond of their national dance which they ac company by clapping of hands and singing March 22 At B past 7 AM having procured camels at 25 pi astres each I left Kajebi to proceed to Kordofan by the desert of Habshabeh Our guide lost his way and took us in a SW di rection to Turah where we arrived in 61 hours The track is over land some portions only of which are tilled much more might be brought into cultivation though not all for some of it is light and too sandy I noticed the impressions of hippopotami in several places the first I had seen they were as much as two miles distant from the present channel though at the height of the inundation the river passes through temporary channels close to the place where I observed the footmarks and there is little doubt but that the animals had been basking in some of these shallow streams which at this season of the year are dry Turah is a village con sisting of a few circular straw huts there is good water in four1837 KajebzJ SbugharatEl tAdayaEr 173 wells In the evening I left Tiirah our direction due W to Abb ghErat where we halted for the night The distance travelled today 8 hours 40 minutes The nest morning a carasan arrived at Abb gharat arld I soon ascertained that it was that of Atii Med an halfbrother to the pre sent Sultan of Dar Fur who yvas on his way to Khartiim intending with lihurshid Pashas permission to go to Cairo to endeavour to persuade Mohammed Ali to furnish him with troopsto proceed against his brother and if possible make Dar Fur tributary to the Egyptian viceroy A gentleman at Khartum had given me a letter of introduction to this sable prince anl I lost no time in presenting myself at his dvan I found him about 25 years of age of the most complete jet black with a countenance frank ingenuous and pleasing and features partaking little of those characteristic of the negro in stature short and inclined to corpulency From him I learnt that the present Sultan would detain all Europeans Yvho shouItI enter his kingdom as pri soners unaler the impression that they llad visited it to make surveys with the idea of returning to Europe and bringing an army to subdue and overthrow him that such prisoners he would treat with collrtesy furnish them with a housen good provisions horsesn slaves a harem c but that a guarl would always be stationed at the door anl the stateprisoners would never be a1 loved even to ride or walk out unless acdompanieel by an escort The Sultan resides at E1 Fisher which is calleal also Tendelti he has an army equipped with swords spears and shields fire arms are unknowvn amongst them The inhabitants of Dar Fur as well as Dar NIarahv to the S of it are Mohammedans Abu Medyan informed me that the distance from ElOleid the capital of Kordofan to E1 Fasher was 13 days of camel journeys lFrom Kobbeh to Kubkabiyah 3 days and from Kobbeh to Debbah nearly opposite to Old Donkolah iS lays In the evening I resumed my journey in a SW direction anel in 3 hours arrived at E1 Adayir The water at Abugharat is good while that at E1 Adayir is ltrackish This latter village is situated on the edge of an uninhabited waste and as it was a bright moonlight night I determined to enter it immediately In 1 hour and 0 minutes we were obliged to stop as the Hfiji was taken suddenly ill Our jourrley today was 4 hours 50 minutes I5hermometer 96 March 24 I set off early and in 51 hours arrived at a single isolated tree the only one between E1 Adayir and Habshabeh

camels eat with avidity Tlle plants are coverel with fine thorns which readily enter the skin and giwe great incon venience and annoyance to the traveller In the evening we travelled 3 hours before

Bornu who were on their way to NIelika They had come by way of Dar Fur anl Kordofan and hal already been twelve months on their journey They hal a very vague idea of their country and all the information I could obtain froin them was that it was situated upon a rilrer called Shari which they believed to be one of the tributary streams of the White River and that the name of their present Sultan is Moharnmel Between E1 Habshalveh and Kowermat innumerable trees are deeayed and laid prostrate the work of those destruetive insects the white ants which abound in this desert The soil

properly belong ing to KordofEn In choosing a wife a man is not obliged to marry a woman of Kordofan and vice terssw In many Arab tribes if a man marries a woman of another tribe and loses his wife he is not afterwards allowed to marry one of his own tribe The tribe of Aulad Seid for example which inhabits Jebel Tor in the peninsula of Mount Sinain does not permit a man who has once married out of his tribe to take a wife from it afterwards but in Kordofan if a man of GunjArah marries a woman of the Meserbat and either divorces her or loses her by deathn he can marry into the tribe to thich he himself belongs or into any other as he chooses Kordofan has been subject to Alohammed Ali Pasha about sixteen years Before he obtained possession of it it was a province of DarElir and when subdued by the DefterdEr Bey was governed by T owashl Emmsellam a black eunuch who with the assistance of Ibrahim Idwir a sultan of DarFur maintained a contest against the Turks for an houl when both he and the sultan being killed his people gave way and submitted to the government of the viceroy of Egypt A market is held every afternoon at 4 oclock where provisions of the most ordinary kind are offered

Kordofan make an iron money from the ore obtained from the neighbourhood of Wad Dhassakiyeh and to which they have given the name of Hasshashah This money resembles a section of a mushroom is made

purpose of capturing slalres from these mountains These expeditions were called Ghaziyeh and when I arrived at ElObeil the troops had just returned with the produce of such an expedition The handsome wome were skl for the harems of the Turks and Arabs the able lsodied men were placed in the ranks the decrepit of both seses the pregnant females and young children were allotted to the soldiers in lieu of money to the amount of a Inoiety of their arrears I cnce witnessed this distribution and a more heart rending scene cannot be imagined for though these blacks had been seized two or three months and had been deprived of their liberty they felt severely the final separation from their friends and families As the soldiers were many months in arrear they were obliged to receive the slaves consitlerably abore their value and sell tilem again at a great sacrifice and many were com pelled to turn their slaves into money in order to relieve their immediate embarrassments A slave therefore who had been received by two soldiers in lieu of 300 piastres was solfl in the bazar for little more than half that sum and many were daily hawked about and disposel of by public auction The slaves are of various prices a child 4 or 5 years old is worth 5 or 60 piastres lOs or  Qs an adult selis from 41 to 61 Beautiful Darfuwi girls are in great request and an unex ceptionable looking one will fetch from 15l to 201 Abyssinian women are much in demand and sell from 101 to 201 ahead But for domestic purposes slaves from Darfur are preferred Up to the period of my visiting Kordofan the bodies of negroes and criminals were never interred but thrown outside the town to be devoured by birds and beasts of prey When Moham med Bey succeeded Mustafa Bey as governor one of his first orders was to collect and burn all the human bones in the vicinity of ElObeid and to direct that slaves in filture should be interrel according to the Mohammedan rites of sepulture But the most distressing circumstance resulting from the slave trade and one more than any other calculated to excite our sym pathy is the system of emasculation carried on at ElObeid This  It is gratifying to add that owing to representations I made to Dr Bowring when he was in Egypt he succeeded in obtaining a promise from Mohammed Ali lfisha to abolish the Ghaziyehs in the BelEdesSudan to discontinue paying the troops

tremendously for twenty minutes the atmosphere was of a bloodred colour succeeded by total darkness this lasted for a quarter of an hour when it began to be lighter and at the end of two hours from the commencement subsided a little though the winl blew hard all the afternoon and during the night The air was charged with fine sand for two or three days afterwards The thermometer during the hurricane was 102 On the 14th while riding near the river I saw the second storm approach and it appeared as if an immense chain of sanl stone rocks was driven before the wind I had just time to reach the residence of Signor Boreani when it overtook me and dark ness came on instantaneollsly This lasted for ten minutes when the atmosphere assumed a deepred colour becoming gradually lighter It was nearly two hours before the hurricane subsided and it was followed by a slight shower of rain on the following day the air was loaded with sand The thermometer at 2 PM On this day was 104 These winds

where each body was depositecl a stone wall was built in form resembling the gable end of a house Each wall was about 5 feet high in the centre and 7 feet in length anel corlstructed of sInall stones with some neatness and not ulllike the way in which the stone walls are built as ferlces to the fielels in many parts of York shire This cemetery is called E1 Arfall  Plllral of Mallstirs1837 Btr Shimazl XbzRarie Ber SarnSyah 187 In 11 hour from the cemetery we reached Bir Abulvaraet Shese wells are situateel in a small grove of domtrees I had taken suffilcient ater from Bir Shimail not to require to re lenish my skins from thcse as the uicle informed me that though the water was gond it was not alras in abuntlancc I lbserved howeser that the rater was springing freely and that the lepth of eacll rell dil not exceed 2O feet At 40 min Iveyond I haltel for thej night having travelled 3 hours from Bir Shimtlil Our tract tolcay sas exceedingly rough iFirst we 1lassed a plain covered with broken stones followed by a smooth harel sur face AfteruJards we made an ascent gradual and telious anl passed over a second plain coTered with broken stones bearing a strong resemblance to the lava of Vesuvius in fact the whole lain aypeared of lroleanie formation I 1lotiee1 in many places the lava in a state of decompsition Iresenting a similar alrlrcear anee to that seen at the foot of Vesuvius thoutll from the in tense lleat of a tropieal sun and the small quantity of rain which falls annually in these latitudes the clecomposition was proceenJing vcry slowly I eould not find ally eraters or etinet xoleanoes The hills on eaeh siele of our route are distant froIn eacll other abut ll2 mile They are numerous some isolated anl others forming small eontinuous chains Some arc formed of grey glanite of a eoarse testure hilst others alpcar to lJe composcel of freestone There is no retularity in the disposition of these formations eaell apearing when and wherc one least expectel to find them Of all the scenery I eser witnessed this was the willest and most savage There is no verdure and rarely a single shrub The desolation is complete Jtl7y 2 After 4 h 45 min travelling re arriered at Bir Sarniyah where we remainel for the remaix der of the dtly Before arriving at the wells we passed a spot wllere the Arales turn up the surface of the desert anel at the depth of from 8 to  2 inches they find a saline earth containing impure muriate of soda in large quantities and from which they malic salt for lcmestic purposes Bir Sarniaah is picturesquely situatel in the midst of mimosas anl doms The latter were particularly fine trees anl the riIve fruit hung in clusters upon the branches There is only one well It is large and its sides substantially built of storle Ttle water is plentiful and quitc free from any lrackish flavour theugh it is slightly tainted with a putrid taste whicll disappears after being a few hours in the skins The guile mentioned that the Manasir Arabs who itlhabit this part of the deaert sometimes attacls antl pillage caravansMr HOLROYDS Journey to Kordofan 1837 188 whilst reposing at the wells I therefore deemed it prudent to put on a watch during the night we were not however molested July 3  We left Bir Sarniyah at a 4 past 6 AM and shortly afterwards passed a cemetery of the Mancisir Arabs The sun was so hot and oppressive that after travelling 2 h 50 Inin we were obliged to stop until the afternoon when we proceeded for 2 h 30 min more Thermometer 102 We travelled for 6 h 30 min on the following day July b We resumed our journey at 20 min to  AM and in 2 h 50 min arrived at EddukEyet a village situated on the Nile Soon after leaving Bir Sarniyah the stratum is coarse grey granite with veins of quartz running from SW to NE and this structure continues to the Nile T was delighted once more to arrive at the river more especially as passing this desert is very severe travelling and doulJly so to me suSering as I was from a violent attack of dysentery which would not give way to any remedy that I adopted though for the benefit of travellers in Africa I may state that I found it uni versally yield in other cases in the course of a few hours to the internal use of ipecacuanha in about the dose of 3 or 4 grains every 4 hours With me this remedy produced no eXect but on the contrary aggravated the symptoms anl I consequently tried laudanum and partially succeeded in controlling it until I arrivel at Cairo From Berber to Eddukayet scarcely a tree is to be founel along the route capable of affording the least shade if we except those in the vicinity of the wells the trees in fact are little more than bushes Fortunately for the first 7 or 8 days the sun was slighly obscured by clouds or the heat would have been insuSerable Of all the journeys I have made this desert is the most wild aril comfortless and uninteresting and I should strongly recommend future travellers to take the line from E1 Metemmeh to Jebel Berkel in preference to that from Berber The whole of this desert is thinly peopled from Berber to 13ir Shimail it is inhabited by the Hasaniyeh Arabs from Blr Shimail for twothirds of the way to the river lJy Manasir Arabs and the last third towards the Nile by Seikiyahs At Eddukayet the placidity of the stream of the Nile is broken ly rocks and here is a slight rapid At 1 days journey from hence higher up the river is the fourth cataract At l past 4 PM I left Eddukayet in l hour 30 minutes we passed the village of E1 Bellal on our right and in 30 minutes afterwards arrived at the Pyramids of Nuri In l0 minutes from the Pyramids we reachel E1 Jerayib and I repaired to the house of the Sheikh where I remained all night1837  EdduRccyetMerawe7zWadzR Halfah 189 The land about Eddukayet is rich but only a small portion of it is under cultivation It continues good to E1 Kerayib Our journey today was 6 hours July 6 At E1 Kerayib the sennaplant is indigenous very luxuriant and in great abunalallce If properly cultivated it might aXord a great profit to the grower At 5 PM I resumed my journey and in s hours 20 minutes arrived at Abdum a small village situatel oposite Meraweh The distance from Berber to EeldukAyet was 54 hours 25 mins Or about 137 miles in a general WNW direction From Eddukayet to Abdiim SW 14 miles The expense of each camel from Berber to Meraweh was 15 piastres 3s July 7 At daybreak I crossed the Nile to Meraweh which may have a population of about 700 I remained here until the evening of the 14th when having procured a boat I returned to lSonkolah where I arrived in the morning of the 221le1 On the 05th I took my leparture from New Donkolall and after a de tention for camels of a few days at Hafir I arrived at Wadi Halfah on the 16th of Augusts 1837 Tv the foregoing paper I beg to append a few observations on the practicability of exploring the sources of the White Nile with a small steamvessel If an expedition left Cairo in the month of July in a steamer with a draught of water not exceeding 2 feet it might with a little care pass all the cataracts betsveen Cairo and Khartum At hlgh Nile the cataract of Essuan lisappears and becomes a rapid The second cataract is a succession of rapids from Wadi Halfah to the third cataract at Hannek which latter is most improperly called a cataract since even at low Nile there is hardly any fall and not so much as to attract notice The fourth and fifth cataracts I hawe not seen ljut from inquiries 1 made I learnt that they would form no obstacle and the sisth is passed without the least difficulty  In passing all the cataracts it would be judicious to have the steamer preceded ly a pilotboat sounding as it proceelcln to prevent any accidellt to the former I lmlentioned the subject to Mr Perring an eminent civil engineer in the employment of Mohammed Ali Pasha and from his knowledge of the Nile and its peculiarities he very kindly made a dravving of a steamer which he calculated to be adapted for a steam expedition He recom mended a boat of light sheetiron 70 feet long on the waterline 16 feet beam and 8 feet deep including the keel and which would not with all requisite stores on boaral draw more than 2 feet of water The power to be two twelveherse oscillating highpressure engines and the fuel to be used wood or charcoal If a steam expedition

J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107141,AN ENQUIRY CONCERNING THE NATURE OF HEAT AND THE MODE OF ITS COMMUNICATION,I206959,VII AN ENQUIRY CONCERNING THE NWTURE OF HEAT AND THE MODE OJ ITS COMMUNICATION BY BENJAMIIIN COUNT OF RUMFORD V P R S FOREZGN ASSOCIATE OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF FRANCE C READ FEBRUARY S 1804 HEAT IS EMPLOYED IN SUCH A VAST VARIETY OF DIFFIERNT PROCESSES IN THE AFFAIRS OF LIFE THAT EVERY NEW DISCOVERY RELATIVE TO IT MUST NECESSARILY BE OF REAL IMPORTANCE TO MANKIND FOR BY OBTAINING A MORE INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF ITS NATURE AND MODE OF ACTION WE SHALL NO DOUBT BE ENABLED NOT ONLY TO EXCITE IT WITH GREATER ECONOMY BUT ALSO TO CONFINE IT WITH GREATER FACILITY AND DIRECT ITS OPERATIONS WITH MORE PRECISION AND EFFECT HAVING MANY YEARS AGO FOUND REASON TO CONCLUDE THAT A CAREFUL OBSERVATION OF THE PHENOMENA WHICH ATTEND THE HEATING AND COOLING OF BODIES OR THE COMMUNICATION OF HEAT FROM ONE BODY TO ANOTHER WOULD AFFORD THE BEST CHANCE OF ACQUIRING A FARTHER INSIGHT INTO THE NATURE OF HEAT MY VIEW IN ALL MY RE SEARCHES ON THIS SUBJECT HAS BEEN PRINCIPALLY DIRECTED TO THAT POINT AND THE EXPERIMENTS OF WHICH I AM NOW TO GIVE AN AC COUNT MAY BE CONSIDERED AS A CONTINUATION OF THOSE I HAVE ALREADY AT DIFFERENT TIMES HAD THE HONOUR OF LAYING BEFORE THE ROYAL SOCIETY AND OF PRESENTING TO THE PUBLIC IN MY ESSAYS IN ORDER THAT THE ATTENTION OF THE SOCIETY MAY NOT BE INTER RUPTED UNNECESSARILY BY DESCRIPTIONS OF INSTRUMENTS IN THE MIDST OF THE ACCOUNTS OF INTERESTING EXPERIMENTS I SHALL BEGIN BY DE SCRIBING THE APPARATUS WHICH WAS PROVIDED FOR THESE RESEARCHES78 COUNT RUMFORDS ENQUIRY CONCERNING THE NATURE OF HEAT AND AS A PERFECT KNOWLEDGE OF THE INSTRUMENTS MADE USE OF IS INDISPENSABLY NECESSARY IN ORDER TO FORM DISTINCT IDEAS OF THE EXPERIMENTS I SHALL TAKE THE LIBERTY TO BE VERY PARTICULAR IN THESE DESCRIPTIONS THE THERMOMETERS FOUR IN NUMBER WHICH WERE USED IN THESE EXPERIMENTS WERE CONSTRUCTED UNDER MY OWN EYE AND WITH THE GREATEST POSSIBLE CARE AND AFTER EVERY TRIAL I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE WITH THEM IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN THEIR ACCURACY THEY APPEAR TO BE VERY PERFECT THEY ARE MERCURIAL THERMOMETERS GRADUATED ACCORDING TO FAHRENHEIT THEIR BULBS ARE CYLINDRICAL 4 INCHES LONG AND O OF AN INCH IN DIAMETER AND THEIR TUBES ARE FROM HA TO 16I INCHIES LONG THE MERCURY WITH WHICH THEY ARE FILLED IS QUITE PURE AND THEY ARE FREED FROM AIR THEIR SCALES WERE DIVIDED WITH THE GREATEST CARE AND BY MEANS OF A NONIUS THEY SHOW EIGHTH PARTS OF ADEGREE VERY DISTINCTLY THEY ARE GRADUATED FROM ABOUT IO DEGREES BELOW THE FREEZING POINT TO OR 6 DE GREES ABOVE THE POINT OF BOILING WATER THEIR BULBS ARE QUITE NAKED THEIR SCALES ENDING ABOUT 1 INCH ABOVE THE JUNCTION OF THE BULB WITH ITS TUBE THE FREEZING POINT IS SITUATED ABOUT 5 INCHES ABOVE THE UPPER END OF THE BULB THE REASON FOR PLACING IT SO HIGH WILL BE EVIDENT FROM THE DETAILS OF THE EXPERIMENTS IN WHICH THESE INSTRUMENTS WERE USED THE INSTRUMENT I CONTRIVED FOR ASCERTAINING THE WARMTH OF CLOTHING IS EXTREMELY SIMPLE IT IS MERELY A HOLLOW CYLINDRICAL VESSEL MADE OF THIN SHEET BRASS IT IS CLOSED AT BOTH ENDS AND HAS A NARROW CYLINDRICAL NECK BY WHICH IT IS OCCASIONALLY FILLED WITH HOT WATER THIS VESSEL BEING COVERED WITH A GARMENT MADE TO FIT ITAN4 THE MODE QF ITS COMMUNICATION 79 COMPOSED OF ANY KIND OF CLOTH ER STUFF OR OTHER WARM COVERING IS SUPPORTED IN A VERTICAL POSITION ON A WOODEN STAND WHICH IS PLACED ON A TABLE IN A LARGE QUIET ROOM AND ONE OF THE THERE MOMETERS ABOVE DESCRIBED BEING PLACED IN THE AXIS OF THE VESSEL THE TIME EMPLOYED IN COOLING THE WATER THROUGH THE CLOTHING WITH WHICH THE INSTRUMENT IS COVETED IS OBSERVED AND NOTED DOWN NOW AS THE TIME OF COOLING THROUGH ANY GVEN INTERVAL OF THE SCALE OF THE THERMOMETER OR FROM ANY GIVEN DEGREE ABOVE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR OF THE ROOM TO ANY OTHER GIVEN LOWER DEGREE BUT STILL ABOVE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR OF THE ROOM WILL BE LONGER OR SHORTER AS THE COVERING OF THE INSTRUMENT IS MORE OR LESS ADAPTED FOR CONFINING HEAT IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE RELATIVE WARMTH OF CLOTHING OF DIFFERENT KINDS MAY BE VERY ACCU RATELY DETERMINED BY EXPERIMENTS OF THIS SORT I PROVIDED FOUR INSTRUMENTS OF THIS KIND ALL VERY NEARLY OF THE SAME DIMENSIONS THEIR CYLINDRICAL BODIES ARE EACH 4 INCHES IN DIAMETER AND 4 INCHES LONG AND THEIR CYLINDRICAL NECKS ARE ABOUT  OF AN INCH IN DIAMETER AND 4 INCHE IN LENGTH THIS NECK IS PLACED IN THE CENTRE OF THE CIRCULAR FLAT TOP OR UPPER END OF THE VERTICAL CYLINDRICAL BODY AND OPPOSITE TO IT IN THE CENTRE OF THE FLAT BOTTOM OF THE BODY THERE IS A HOLLOW CYLINDER 1 OF AN INCH IN DIAMETER AND 3 INCHES LONG PROJECTING DOWNWARDS INTO WHICH A VERTICAL CYLINDER OF WOOD IS FITTED ON THE TOP OF WHICH THE INSTRUMENT IS SUPPORTED IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THE AIR HAS FREE ACCESS TO EVERY PART OF IT THIS CYLINDER OF WOOD CONSTITUTES A PART OF THIE WOODEN STAND ABOVEMENTIONED AS THE THERMOMETER IS PLACED IN THE AXIS OF THE CYLINDRICAL VESSEL AND AS ITS BULB ISJUST AS LONG AS THE BODY OF THIS VESSEL IT IS EVIDENT THAT IT MUST EVER INDICATE THE MEAN TEMPERATURE OF80 COUNT RUMFORDS ENQUIRY CONCERNING THE NATURE OF HEAT THE WATER IN THE VESSEL HOWEVER DIFFERENT THE TEMPERATURE OF THAT WATER MAY BE AT DIFFERENT DEPTHS THE THERMOMETER IS FIRMLY SUPPORTED IN ITS PLACE BY CAUSING A PART OF THE LOWER END OF ITS SCALE TO ENTER THE NECK OF THE CYLINDRICAL VESSEL AND TO FIT IT WITH SOME DEGREE OF ACCURACY BUT NOT SO NICELY AS TO BE IN DANGER OF STICKING FAST IN IT THE LOWER END OF THE BULB OF THE THERMOMETER DOES NOT AB SOLUTELY TOUCH THE BOTTOM OF THE VESSEL BUT IT IS VERY NEAR TOUCHING IT FIGURES I PLATE IV VILL GIVE A CLEAR IDEA OF THIS INSTRUMENT PLACED ON ITS WOODEN STAND WHICH IS SO CONTRIVED THAT THE INSTRUC NENT MAY BE PLACED HIGHER OR LOWER AT PLEASURE THE FOREGOING DESCRIPTION OF THIS INSTRUMENT IS SO PARTICULAR THAT THE FIGURE WILL BE EASILY UNDERSTOOD WITHOUT ANY FARTHER ILLUSTRATION THE CYLINDRICAL VESSEL IS REPRESENTED PLACED ON THE STAND WITH ITS THERMOMETER IN ITS PLACE AS IN SOME OF THE FIRST EXPERIMENTS I MADE WITH THIS IN STRUMENT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO APPLY THE COVERINGS WHICH I USED TO THE ENDS OF THE BODY OF THE INSTRUMENT I ENDEAVOURED BY COVERING UP THOSE ENDS WITH A PERMANENT AND VERY WARM COVERING TO OBLIGE MOST OF THE HEAT TO PASS OFF THROUGH THE VERTICAL SIDES OF THE INSTRUMENT TO WHICH IT WAS EASY TO FIT AL MOST ANY KIND OF COVERING AND MORE ESPECIALLY COVERINGS OF VARIOUS THICKNESSES OF CONFINED AIR THE RELATIVE WARMTH OF WHICH I WAS VERY DESIROUS OF ASCERTAINING THE MEANS I EMPLOYED FOR COVERING UP THE ENDS OF THE IN STRUMENT WERE AS FOLLOWS HAVING PROVIDED TWO THIN CYLINDRICAL WOODEN BOXES LIKE COMMON PILLBOXES BUT MUCH LARGER SOMETHING LESS IN DIAMETER THAN THE BODY OF THE INSTRUMENT AND 2 2 INCHES DEEP I DRIED THEM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND AFTERAND THE MODE OF ITS COMMUNICATION 8T HAVING VARNISHED THEM WITHIN AND WITHOUT WITH SPIRIT VARNISH I COVERED THEM WITHIN AND WITHOUT WITH FINE WOVE WRITINGPAPER AND THEN GAVE THE PAPER THREE COATS OF THE SAME VARNISH I THEN PERFORATED THE BOTTOMS OF THESE BOXES WITH ROUND HOTES JUST LARGE ENOUGH TO ADMIT THE NECK OF THE INSTRUMENT AND THE CYLINDRICAL PROJECTION AT ITS BOTTOM AND THEN INVERTED THEM OVER THE TWO ENDS OF THE INSTRUMENT FILLING THE BOXES AT THE SAME TIME WITH EIDERDOWN THESE BOXES WERE FIXED AND CONFINED IN THEIR PLACES BY MEANS EASY TO BE IMAGINED AND IN ORDER TO CONFINE THE HEAT STILL MORE EFFECTUALLY EACH OF THE BOXES WAS COVERED ON THE OUTSIDE WITH A CAP OF FUR AS OFTEN AS THE INSTRUMENT WAS USED AS WAS ALSO THAT PART OF THE NECK OF THE INSTRUMENT WHICH PROJECTED ABOVE THE BOX TWO OF THE INSTRUMENTS WHICH I SHALL DISTINGUISH BY THE NUMBERS 1 AND 2 WERE COVERED UP AT THEIR ENDS IN THIS MANNER THE OTHER TWO INSTRUMENTS NO 8 AND NO 4 WERE LEFT IN THE STATE REPRESENTED BY THE FIGURE 1  THAT IS TO SAY THE ENDS OF THEIR CYLINDRICAL BODIES WERE NOT COVERED WITH PERMANENT COVERINGS IN EACH EXPERIMENT TWO SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS NO T AND NO 2 FOR INSTANCE OR NO 3 AND NO 4 WERE USED THE ONE NAKED AND THE OTHER COVERED AND AS THE NAKED INSTRU IENT ALWAYS SERVED AS A STANDARD WITH WHICH THIE RESULTS OF THE EXPERIMENTS MADE WITH THE OTHER WERE COMPARED IT IS EVIDENT THAT THIS AR RANGEMENT RENDERED THE GENERAL RESULTS OF THE EXPERIMENTS MUCH MORE SATISFACTORY AND CONCLUSIVE THAN THEY COULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN HAD THE EXPERIMENTS MADE ON DIFFERENT DAYS AND WITH VARIOUS KINDS OF COVERING BEEN MADE SINGLY OR UNACCOMPANIED BY A FIXED AND INVARIABLE STANDARD THE EXPERIMENTS WERE MADE AND REGISTERED IN THE FOLLOWING MDCCCIV M82 COUNT RUMFORDS ENQUIR NCERNING THE NATURE OF HNEAT MANNER THE TWO INSTRUMENTS USED IN THE EXPERIMENT PLACED ON THEIR WOODEN STANDS BEING SET DOWN ON THE FLOOR WERE FILLED TO WITHIN ABOUT XJI INCH OF THE TOPS OF THEIR CYLINDRICAL NECKS WITH BOIIING HOT WATER AND A THERMOMETER BEING PT INTO EACH OF THEM THEY WERE PLACED AT THE DISTANCE OF 3 FEET FROM EACH OTHER ON A LARGE TABLE IN A CORNER OF A LARGE QUIET ROOMED WHERE THEY WERE SUFFERED TO COOL UNDISTURBED NEAR THEM ON THE SAME TABLE AND AT THE SAME HEIGHT ABOVE THE TABLE THERE WAS PLACED ANOTHER THERMOMETER SUSPENDED IN THE AIR TO THE ARM OF A STANDBY WHICH THE TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR OF THE ROOM WAS ASCERTAINED FROM TIME TO TIME NO PERSON WAS PERMITTED TO PASS THROUGH THE ROOM WHILE AN EXPERIMENT WAS GOING ON AND IN ORDER TO PREVENT AS FAR AS IT WAS POSSIBLE ALL THOSE CURRENTS OF AIR IN THE ROOM WHICH WERE OCCASIONED BY PARTIAL HEAT PRODUCED BY THE LIGHT WHICH CAME IN AT THE WINDOWS THE WINDOWSHUTTERS WERE KEPT CONSTANTLY SHUT ONZE OF THEM ONLY BEING OPENED FOR A MOMENT NOW AND THEN JUST TO OBSERVE THE THERINOMETERS AND NOTE DOWN THE PROGRESS OF THE EXPERIMENT THE RESULTS OF EACH EXPERIMENT WERE ENTERED ON A SEPARATE SHEET OF PAPER WHICH PAPER WAS PREVIOUSLY PREPARED FOR THAT ISE BY BEING DIVIDED INTO SEPARATE VERTICAL COLUMNS BY LINES DRAWN WITH A PEN AND RULED IN PARALLEL HORIZONTAL LINES WITH A LEAD PENCIL THE FOLLOWING IS AN EXACT COPY OF ONE OF THESE REGISTERSHEETS AND CONTAINS THE RESULTS OF ANL ACTUAL AND VERY INTERESTING EXPE RIINENT WHICH

THE RESULTS OF DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTS AND PARTICULARLY OF SUCH AS WERE MADE ON DIFFERENT DAYS SO AS TO DETERMINE WITH PRECISION HOW MUICH WARMER ONE KIND OF COVERING WAS LTHAN ANOTHER IT XAS NECESSARY TO FIX ON SOME PARTICULAR INTERVAL IN THE SCALE OF THE THERMOMETER OR NUMBER OF DEGREES COMMENCING AT SOME CERTAIN INVARIABLE NUMBER OF DEGREES ABOVE THE TEMR PEIATURE OF THE AIR BY WHICH THE INSTRUMENT WAS SURROUNDED IN ORDER THAT THE WARMTH OF THE COVERING OR ITS POWER OF CONFINING HEATN MIGHT WITH CERTAINTY BE ESTIMATED BY THE TIME EMPLOYED IN COOLING THROUGH THAT INTERVAL BY THE RESULTS OF A GREAT NUMBER OF EXPERIMENTS I FOUND THAT THE SAME INSTRUMENT COOLED THROUGH ANY GIVEN SMALL NUMBER OF DEGREES IO DEGREES FOR INSTANCE IN VERY NEARLY THE SAME TIME WHATEVER WAS THE TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR OF THE ROOM PRO VIDED ALWAYS THAT THE POINT FROM WHICH THESE 0O DEGREES COM MENCED WAS AT THE SAME GIVEN NUMBER OF DEGREES ABOVE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR ATITHE TIME BEING THE

PARTICULAR ACCOUNT OF THLR N TWFLIIS PLANE AS IT SOMETIMES HAPPENED THOUGH VERY SELDOI IN THE COURSE86 COUNT RUMFORD S ENQUIRY CONCERNING THE NATURE OF HEAT OF AN EXPERIMENT WHICH COMMONLY LASTED SEVERAL HOURS THAT I WAS CALLED AWAY AND WAS NOT PRESENT TO OBSERVE THE THERMO METER AT THE MOMENT OF THE PASSAGE OF THE MERCURY THROUGH ONE OR BOTH OF THOSE POINTS OF ITS SCALE WHICH FORMED THE LIMITS OF THE GIVEN INTERVAL CHOSEN AS THE STANDARD FOR A COMPARISON OF THE RESULTS OF THE EXPERIMENTS WITH EACH OTHER IT BECAME A MATTER OF CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE TO FIND MEANS FOR SUPPLYING THESE ACCIADENTAL DEFECTS AND ASCERTAINING THE POINTS IN QUESTION BY INTERPOLATION IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE MEANS OF DOING THIS I ENDEAVOURED TO INVESTIGATE THE LAW OF THE COOLING OF HOT BODIES IN A COLD FLUID MEDIUM AND I FOUND REASON TO CONCLUDE A B C E G L THAT IF ON THE RIGHT LINE AB A PERPENDICULAR CD BE TAKEN EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE OF THE TEMPERATURES OF THE HOT BODY AND OF THE COLDER MEDIUM

EXPOSED TO COOL IN A COLD FLUID MEDIUM PARTS WITH ITS HEAT IS AS THE DIFFERENCE OF THE TEMPERATURES OF THE BODY AND OF THE ME DILIM IT IS MOST CERTAIN THAT THE CURVE PQ COULD BE NO OTHER THAN THE LOGARITHMIC CURVE PERHAPS IT MAY BE SO IN FACT AND THAT THE VARIATIONS FROM IT WHICH MY EXPERIMENTS INDICATED WERE OWING SOLELY TO THE IMPERFECTION OF THE DIVISIONS OF OUR THERMO METERS IF IT BE SO IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO DIVIDE THE SCALE OF A THERMOMETER IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO INDICATE WITH CERTAINTY EQUAL INCREMENTS OF BEAT AS THERMOMETERS OUGHT TO DO BUT THIS IS NOT THE PROPER PLACE TO ENLARGE ON THIS SUBJECT I MAY PERHAPS RETURN TO IT HEREAFTER PASSING OVER IN SILENCE A NUMBER OF EXPERIMENTS I MADE IN ORDER TO GET THOROUGHLY ACQUAINTED WITH MY NEW INSTRU MENTS AND TO ASSURE MYSELF THAT THE RESULTS OF SIMILAR EX PERIMENTS MADE WITH THEM WERE UNIFORM AND MIGHT BE DE PENDED ON I SHALL NOW PROCEED TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF SEVERAL EXPERIMENTS MADE WITH POINTED VIEWS THE RESULTS OF SOME OF WHICH

WITH ITS VERTICAL SIDES COVERED WITH A SINGLE COVERING OF FINE IRISH LINEN SUCH AS IS SOLD IN LONDON FOR ABOUT 4S PER YARD CLOSELY APPLIED TO THE BODLYOF THE INSTRUMENT WAS FILLED WITH HOT WATER AT THE SAMETIME AND PLACED ON THE SAME TABLE TO COOL THIS EXPERIMENT LASTED MANY HOURS AND IN THAT PERIOD THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER IN EACH OF THE INSTRUMENTS WAS CARE FULLY OBSERVED AND NOTED DOWN A

PASSAGE OF HEAT OUT OF A HOT BODY INSTEAD OF CONFINING IT IN IT DESIROUS OF SEEING WHETHER THE SAME COVERING WOULD OR WOULD NOT EXPEDITE THE PASSAGE OF HEAT INTO THE INSTRUMENT AFTER HAVING SUFFERED BOTH INSTRUMENTS TO COOL DOWN TO THE TEMPERATURE OF ABOUT 420 I REMOVED THEM INTO A WARM ROOM IN WHICH THE AIR WAS AT THE TEMPERATURE OF 620 AND I FOUND THAT THE INSTRUMENT NO 2 WHICH WAS CLOTHED ACQUIRED HEAT CONSIDERABLY FASTER THAN THE OTHER NO I WHICH WAS NAKED THE DETAILS OF THIS EXPERIMENT WHICH WAS MADE ON THE I ITH OF MARCH 3803 MAY BE SEEN IN PAGE 83AND THE MODE OF ITS COMMUNICATION 9 THE DISCOVERY OF THESE EXTRAORDINARY FACTS SURPRISED ME AND EXCITED ALL MY CURIOSITY AND I IMMEDIATELY SET ABOUT INVESTI GATING THEIR CAUSE AS IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT AIR ADHERES WITH CONSIDERABLE OBSTI NACY TO THE SURFACES OF SOME SOLID BODIES I CONCEIVED IT TO BE POSSIBLE THAT THE PARTICLES OF AIR IN IMMEDIATE CONTACT WITH THE SURFACE OF THE CYLINDRICAL VESSEL NO 1 MIGHT IN FACT BE SO AT TACHED TO THE METAL AS TO ADHERE TO IT WITH SOME CONSIDERABLE FORCE AND IF THAT WERE THE CASE AS CONFINED AIR IS KNOWN TO CONSTITUTE A VERY WARM COVERING IT APPEARED TO ME TO BE POSSIBLE THAT THE COOLING OF THE VESSEL NO IN MIGHT HAVE BEEN RETARDED BY SUCH AN INVISIBLE COVERING OF CONFINED AIR WHICH COVERING IN THE EXPERIMENT WITH THE VESSEL NO 2 HAD BEEN DISPLACED AND IN A GREAT MEASURE DRIVEN AWAY BY THE COLDER COVERING OF LINEN BY WHICH THE BODY OF THE INSTRUMENT WAS CLOSELY EMBRACED I CONCEIVED THAT THE LINEN MUST HAVE ACCELERATED THE COOLING OF THE INSTRUMENT EITHER BY FACILITATING THE APPROACH OF A SUC CESSION OF FRESH PARTICLES OF COLD AIR OR BY INCREASING THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION AND WITH A VIEW TO ELUCIDATE THAT IMPORTANT POINT THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTS WERE MADE EXPER NO 2 REMOVING THE LINEN WITH WHICH THE INSTRUMENT NO 2 WAS CLOTHED I NOW COVERED THE SIDES OF THAT INSTRUMENT WITH A THIN TRANSPARENT COATING OF GLUE AND WHEN IT WAS QUITE DRY AND HARD I AGAIN FILLED THE TWO

HEAT WHEN WE CONSIDER THIS EXPERIMENT WITH ATTENTION WE SHALL FIND REASON TO CONCLUDE THAT IF IT WERE BY FACILITATING THE AP PROACH AND TEMPORARY CONTACT OF A SUCCESSION OF FRESH PARTICLES OF THE COLD AIR OF THE ROOM TO THE SURFACE OF THE GLUE WHICH WAS NOW IN FACT BECOME THE SURFACE OF THE HOT BODY THAT THE COOLING OF THE INSTRUMENT WAS ACCELERATED THE METAL BEING AS COMPLETELY COVERED AND THE AIR SUPPOSED TO BE ATTACHED AND FIXED TO ITS SURFACE AS COMPLETELY EXCLUDED BY ONE COATING OF THE GLUE AS IT COULD BE BY TWO OR MORE TWO COATINGS COULD NOT POSSIBLY ACCELERATE THE COOLING OF THE INSTRUMENT MORE THAN ONE  BUT IF ON THE OTHER HAND THE COOLING OF THE INSTRUMENT IN THIS EXPERI MENT WAS ACCELERATED NOT BY FACILITATING AND ACCELERATING THE MOTIONS OF THE CIRCUMAMBIENT COLD AIR BUT BY FACILITATING AND INCREASING THOSE RADIATIONS WHICH ARE KNOWN TO PROCEED FROM HOT BODIES I CONCEIVED THAT TWO COATINGS OF THE GLUE MIGHT POSSIBLY ACCELERATE THE COOLING OF THE VESSEL MORE THAN ONE IN ORDER TO PUT THIS CONJECTURE TO THE TEST I MADE THE FOLLOWING DECISIVE EXPERIMENT EXPER NO S I NOW GAVE THE INSTRUMENT NO 2 A SECOND COATING OF GLUE AND WHEN IT WAS THOROUGHLY DRY I REPEATED THE

VARNISH HAD BECOME QUITE DRY AND HARD I REPEATED THE EXPERIMENT ABOVEMENTIONED AND FINDING THAT THIS COVERING LIKE THAT OF GLUE EXPEDITED THE COOLING OF THE INSTRUMENT I FIRST ADDED A SECOND COATING

INSTRUMENT NO 2 I NOW RENDERED ITS SIDES OF A PERFECTLY DEEP CBLACK COIOUR BY HOLDING IT OVER THE FLAME OF A WAX CANDLE AND REPEATING THE USUAL EXPERIMENT THE RESULTS WERE AS FOLLOWS TIME OF COOLING THROUGH THE STANDARD INTERVAL THE INSTRUMENT NO I NAKED  J MM NO 2 BLACKENED    36 MIN IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN THE QUANTITY OF MATTER WHICH COMPOSED THIS BLACK COVERING I WEIGHED A SMALL PIECE OF CLEAN AND VERY FINE LINEN AND HAVING WIPED OFF WITH IT ALL THE BLACK MATTER FROM THE BODY OF THE INSTRUMENT NO 2 IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THE WHOLE OF IT REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE LINEN I WEIGHED IT AGAIN AND BY THAT MEANS DISCOVERED THAT THE WHOLE OF THIS BLACK SUBSTANCE WHICH HAD SO COMPLETELY COVERED THE SIDES OF THE IN STRUMENT A SURFACE OF POLISHED BRASS O SUPERFICIAL INCHES THAT THE METAL DID NOT SHINE THROUGH IT IN ANY PART WEIGHED NO MORE THAN 1 OF A GRAIN TROY IHLOW THIS VERY THIN COVERING WHICH IF THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THE BLACK MATTER WERE ONLY EQUAL TO THAT OF WATER WOULD AMOUNT TO NO MORE THAN  OF AN INCH IN THICKNESS COULD EXPEDITE96 COUNT RUMFORDS ENQUIRY CONCERNING THE NATURE OF HEAT THE COOLING OF THE INSTRUMENT IN THE MANNER IT WAS FOUND TO DO IS WHAT STILL REMAINS TO BE SHOWN BUT BEFORE I PROCEED ANY FARTHER IN THESE ABSTRUSE ENQUIRIES I SHALL MAKE A FEW OBSERVA TIONS RELATIVE TO THE RESULTS OF THE FOREGOING EXPERIMENTS ALTHOUGH WE MAY WITH SAFETY PRESUME THAT THE VELOCITIES WITH WHICH THE HEAT ESCAPED THROUGH THE SIDES OF THE INSTRUMENTS WERE NEARLY AS THE TIMES INVERSELY TAKEN UP IN COOLING THROUGH THE GIVEN INTERVAL OF IO DEGREES YET AS SOME HEAT MUST HAVE MADE ITS WAY IN THE COURSE OF THE EXPERIMENT THROUGH THE ENDS OF THE INSTRUMENT NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE CARE THAT WAS TAKEN TO PREVENT IT BY COVERING THEM UP WITH WARM CLOTHING IT IS NECES SARY IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO COMPARE THE RESULTS OF THE PRECEDING EXPERIMENTS IN A SATISFACTORY MANNER TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH OF THE HEAT MADE ITS ESCAPE THROUGH THE COVERED ENDS OF THE INSTRU MENTS DURING THE TIME THE INSTRUMENTS WERE COOLING THROUGH THE INTERVAL IN QUESTION IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THAT POINT I NOW REMOVED THE COVERING FROM THE ENDS OF THE INSTRUMENT NO 1  AND WHEN IT WAS QUITE NAKED I FOUND ON MAKING THE EXPERIMENT THAT IT COOLED THROUGH THE GIVEN INTERVAL ITN 45 MINUTES WHEN ITS TWO ENDS AND ITS CYLINDRICAL NECK WERE COVERED UP  I HAVE FOUND MYSELF OBLIGED IN THIS AS IN MANY OTHER PLACES TO MAKE USE OF LAN GUAGE WHLCH IS FAR FROM BEING AS CORRECT AS I COULD WISH I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT HEAT EVER MAKES ITS ESCAPE IN THE MANNER HERE INDICATED BUT I COULD NOT VENTURE TO USE UNCOMMON EXPRESSIONS ILL POINTING OUT THE PHENOMENA IN QUESTION HOWEVER WELL ADAPTED SUCH EXPRESSIONS MIGHT BE TO DESCRIBE THE EVENTS WHICH REALLY TAKE PLACE IF IT SHOULD BE FOUND THAT CALORIC LIKE PHLOGISTON IS MERELY A CREATURE OF THE IMAGINATION AND HAS NO REAL EXSTENCE WHICH HAS EVER APPEARED TO ME TO BE EXTREMELY PROBABLE IN THAT CASE IT MUST BE INCORRECT TO SPEAK OF HEAT AS MAKING ITS ESCAPE OUT OF ONE BODY AND PASSING INTO ANOTHER BUT HOW OFTEN ARE WE OBLIGED TO USE INCORRECT AND FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE IN SPEAKING OF NATURAL PHENOMENAAND THE MODE OF ITS COMMUNICATION 97 NVITH WARM CLOTHING I FOUND BY TAKING THE MEAN OF THE RESULTS OF SEVERAL EXPERIMENTS THAT IT REQUIRED SS2 MINUTES TO COOL THROUGH THE SAME INTERVAL ON MEASURING THE INSTRUMENT WITH CARE I FOUND ITS DIMENS SIONS TO BE AS FOLLOWS

MINUTES FOR THE QUANTITY IN QUESTION 805S8 PARTS TO PASS OFF THROUGH THE SAME SURFACE BUT WHEN THAT SURFACE WAS BLACKENED OVER THE FLAME OF A CANDLE THAT QUANTITY OF HEAT PASSED OFF THROUGH IT IN 361 MINUTES HENCE IT APPEARS THAT THE VELOCITY WITH WHICH HEAT IS GIVEN OFF FROM THE NAKED SURFACE OF A HEATED METAL EXPOSED TO COOL IN THE AIR IS TO THE VELOCITY WITH WHICH IT IS GIVEN OFF BY THE SAME METAL WHEN ITS SURFACE IS BLACKENED IN THE MANNER ABOVE DE SCRIBED AS 36T TO 634 OR AS 5654 TO 10000O VERY NEARLY FOR THE VELOCITIES ARE AS THE TIMES OF COOLING INVERSELY AGAIN IN THE EXPERIMENT NO 6

I SHALL HASTEN TO EXPERIMENTS FROM THE RESULTS OF WHICH WE SHALL OBTAIN MORE SATISFACTORY INFORMATION BUT BEFORE I PROCEED ANY FARTHER I MUST GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF AN IN STRUMENT I CONTRIVED FOR MEASURING OR RATHER FOR DISCOVERING THOSE VERY SMALL CHANGES OF TEMPERATURE IN BODIES WHICH ARE OC CASIONED BY THE RADIATIONS OF OTHER NEIGHBOURING BODIES WHICH HAPPEN TO BE AT A HIGHER OR AT A LOWER TEMPERATURE THIS INSTRUMENT WHICH I SHALL TAKE THE LIBERTY TO CALL A THERM MOSCOPE IS VERY SIMPLE IN ITS CONSTRUCTION LIKE THE HYGROMETER OF MR LESLIE AS HE HAS CHOSEN TO CALL HIS INSTRUMENT IT IS COMPOSED OF TWO GLASS BALLS ATTACHED TO THE TWO ENDS OF A BENT GLASS TUBE BUT THE BALLS INSTEAD OF BEING NEAR TOGETHER ARE PLACED AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM EACH OTHER AND THE TUBE WHICH CONNECTS THEM INSTEAD OF BEING BENT IN ITS MIDDLE AND ITS TWO EXTREMITIES TURNED UPWARDS IS QUITE STRAIGHT IN THE MIDDLE AND ITS TWO EXTREMITIES TO WHICH ITS TWO BALLS ARE ATTACHED ARE TURNED PERPENDICULARLY UPWARDS SO AS TO FORM EACH A RIGHT ANGLE NWITH THE MIDDLE PART OF THE TUBE WHICH REMAINS IN A HORI ZONTAL POSITION AT ONE OF THE ELBOWS OF THIS TUBE THERE IS INSERTED A SHORT TUBE OF NEARLY THE SAME DIAMETER BY MEANS OF WHICH A VERY SMALL QUANTITY OF SPIRIT OF WINE TINGED OF A RED COLOUR IS INTRO DUCED INTO THE INSTRUMENT AND AFTER THIS IS DONE THE END OFIOG COUNT RUIFORDS ENQUIRYCONCERNING THE NATURE OF IEAT THIS SHORT TUBE WHICH IS ONLY ABOUT AN INCH LONG IS SEALED HER INETICALLY AND ALL COMMUNICATION IS CUT OFF BETWEEN THE AIR IN THE BALLS OF THE INSTRUMENT AND IN ITS TUBE AND THE EXTERNAL AIR OF THE ATMOSPHERE A SMALL BUBBLE OF THE SPIRIT OF WINE IF I MAY BE ALLOWED TO USE THAT EXPRESSION IS NOW MADE TO PASS OUT OF THE SHORT TUBE INTO THE LONG CONNECTING TUBE AND THE OPERATION IS SO MANAGED THAT THIS BUBBLE WHICH IS ABOUT 1 OF AN INCH IN LENGTH REMAINS STATIONARY AT OR NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THE HORIZONTAL PART OF THE TUBE WHEN THE TEMPERATURE AND CONSEQUENTLY THE ELASTICITY OF THE AIR IN THE TWO BALLS AT T1HE TWO EXTREMITIES OF THE TUBE IS PRE CISELY THE SAME BY MEANS OF A SCALE OF EQUAL PARTS ATTACHED TO THE HORIZONTAL PART OF THE CONNECTING TUBE THE POSITION OF THE BUBBLE CAN BE ASCERTAINED AND ITS MOVEMENTS OBSERVED IF N1OW THE BUBBLE BEING AT REST IN ITS PROPER PLACE ONE OF THE BALLS OF THE INSTRUMENT BE EXPOSED TO THE CALORIFIC RAYS WHICH PROCEED IN ALL DIRECTIONS FROM A HOT BODY WHILE THE OTHER BALL IS DEFENDED FROM THOSE RAYS BY A SCREEN THE AIR IN THE BALL SO EX POSED TO THE ACTION OF THESE RAYS WILL BE HEATED AND ITS ELAS TICITY BEING INCREASED BY THIS ADDITIONAL HEAT ITS PRESSURE WILL NO LONGER BE COUNTERBALANCED BY THE ELASTICITY OF THE COLDER AIR IN THE OTHER BALL AND THE BUBBLE WILL BE FORCED TO MOVE OUT OF ITS PLACE AND TO TAKE ITS STATION NEARER TO THE COLDER BALL BY PRESENTING TWO HOT BODIES AT THE SAME TIME TO THE TWO BALLS OF THE INSTRUMENT TAKING CARE THAT EACH BALL SHALL BE DE FENDED FROM THE ACTION OF THE HOT BODY PRESENTED TO THE OPPOSITE BALL THE DISTANCES OF THESE HOT BODIES FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE BALLS MAY BE SO REGULATED THAT THEIR ACTIONS ON THOSE BALLS MAY BE EQUAL HOWEVER THE TEMPERATURES OF THOSE HOT BODIES MAY DIFFERAND THE MODE OF ITS COMMUNICATION 103 OR HOWEVER DIFFERENT MAY BE THE QUANTITIES OR INTENSITIES OF THE CALORIFIC RAYS WHICH THEY EMIT THE INSTRUMENT WILL SHOW WITH THE GREATEST CERTAINTY WHEN THE ACTIONS OF THESE HOT BODIES ON THEIR RESPECTIVE BALLS ARE EQUAL FOR UNTIL THEY BECOME UNEQUAL THE BUBBLE WILL REMAIN IM MOVEABLE IN ITS PLACE AND WHEN THE ACTIONS OF TWO HOT BODIES ON THE INSTRUMENT ARE EQUAL THE RELATIVE INTENSITIES OF THE RAYS THEY EMIT MAY BE ASCERTAINED BY THE DISTANCES OF THE BODIES FROM THE BALLS OF THE INSTRUMENT IF THEIR DISTANCES FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE BALLS ARE EQUAL THE INTENSITIES OF THE RAYS THEY EMIT MUST OF COURSE BE EQUAL IF THOSE DISTANCES ARE UNEQUAL THE INTENSITIES WILL PROBABLY BE AS THE SQUARES OF THE DISTANCES INVERSELY A DISTINCT AND

PROCEED FROM THE PERSON WHO APPROACHES IT TO MAKE THE EXPERIT MENTS UNLESS CARE BE TAKEN BY THE INTERPOSITION OF SCREENS TO PREVENT THOSE RAYS FROM FALLING ON THE BALLS THESE SCREENS CAN BE BEST AND MOST READILY MADE BY PROVIDING LIGHT WOODEN FRAMES ABOUT 2 FEET SQUARE AND HALF AN INCH IN THICKNESS AND COVERING THEM ON BOTH SIDES FIRST WITH THICK CARTRIDGE PAPER AND THEN WITH WHAT IS CALLED GILT

BEING NECESSARY FOR HIM TO REMOVE HIS EYE FROM THE BUBBLE WHICH HE SHOULD CONSTANTLY HAVE IN HIS VIEW I MAKE USE OF A SIMPLE MACHINE WHICH I HAVE FOUND TO BE VERY USEFUL IT IS A LONG AND SHALLOW

TO THE UNDER SIDE OF EACH OF THESE SLIDING BOARDS AND THERE IS AI SMALL COG WHEEL IN THE BOX THE AXIS OF WHICH PASSES THROUGH THE SIDES OF THE BOX AND IS FURNISHED WITH A WINCH IN THE FRONT OF THE BOX BY TURNING ROUND THESE WHEELS BY MEANS OF THEIR WINCHES BOTH OF WHICH CAN BE MANAGED BY THE SAME PERSON AT THE SAME TIME THE SLIDERS MAY BE MOVED BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AT PLEASURE IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN WITH FACILITY AND DISPATCH THE DISTANCES OF THE HOT BODIES FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE BALLS THE TOP OF THE FRONT SIDE OF THE WOODEN BOX IS DIVIDED INTO INCHES ON EACH SIDE OF THE FIXED PART OF THE COVER OF THE BOX AND THERE IS A NONIUS BELONGING TO EACH OF THE SLIDERS WHICH IS PLACED IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO INDICATE AT ALL TIMES THE EXACT DISTANCE OF THE HOT BODY FROM ITS CORRESPONDING BALL THE LEVEL OF THE UPPER SURFACE OF THAT PART OF THE COVER B DCCCIV PIO6 COUNT RUMFORDS ENQUIRY CONCERNIGG THE NATURE OF HEAT WHICH IS FIXED IS ABOUT  OF AN INCH HIGHER THAN THE LEVEL OF THE UPPER SURFACE OF THE SLIDERS IN ORDER THAT WHEN A THER MOSCOPE LONGER THAN THIS FIXED PART IS PLACED ON IT THE SLIDERS MAY PASS FREELY UNDER ITS TWO PROJECTING ENDS WITHOUT DE RANGING IT IT IS EVIDENT FROM THIS DESCRIPTION THAT BY PLACING THE THER MOSCOPE ON THE FIXED PART OF THE COVER OF THE BOX WITH ITS TWO BALLS IN A LINE PARALLEL TO THE AXIS OF THE BOX AND BY PLACING THE TWO HOT BODIES PRESENTED TO THE TWO BALLS OF THE INSTRUMENT ELEVATED TO A PROPER HEIGHT ON STANDS SET DOWN ON THE SLIDERS AN OBSERVER BY TAKING THE TWO WINCHES IN HIS HANDS KEEPING HIS EYE FIXED ON THE BUBBLE MAY WITH THE GREATEST FACILITY SO REGULATE THE DISTANCES OF THE HOT BODIES FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE BALLS THAT THE BUBBLE SHALL REMAIN IMMOVEABLE IN ITS PLACE IN ORDER TO BE LABLE TO ASCERTAIN PRECISELY THE TEMPERATURES OF THE HOT BODIES PRESENTED TO THIS INSTRUTMENT AND IN ORDER THAT THEIR SURFACES MIGHT BE EQUAL TWO EQUAL CYLINDRICAL VESSELS OF THIN SHEET BRASS WITH OBLIQUE CYLINDRICAL NECKS WERE

INSERTED INTO THE BODY OF THIS VESSEL THROUGH ITS NECK SHOWS THE TEMPERATURE OF THE CONTAINED WATER CARE IS NECESSARY IN CONSTRUCTING A THERMOSCOPE TO CHOOSE A TUBE OF A PROPER DIAMETER IF ITS BORE BE TOO SMALL IT WILL BE FOUND VERY DIFFICULT TO KEEP THE SPIRIT OF WINE IN ONE MASS AND IF IT BE TOO LARGE THE LITTLE HORIZONTAL COLUMN IT FORMS WHICH I HAVE CALLED A BUBBLE WILL BE ILL DEFINED AT ITS TWO ENDS WHICH WILL RENDER IT DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN ITS PRECISE SITUATION AFTER A NUMBER OF TRIALS I HAVE FOUND THAT A TUBE THE BORE OF WHICH IS OF SUCH A SIZE THAT I INCH OF IT IN LENGTH CONTAINS ABOUT AD OR IS GRAINS TROY OF MERCURY ANSWERS BEST FOR A TUBE OF THAT SIZE THE BALLS MAY BE ABOUT II INCH IN DIAMETER AND THEY SHOULD BOTH BE PAINTED BLACK WITH INDIAN INK WHICH RENDERS THE INSTRUMENT MORE SENSIBLE I HAVE AN INSTRUMENT OF THIS KIND THE TUBE OF WHICH IS QUITE FILLED WITH SPIRIT OF WINE EXCEPTING ONLY THE SPACE OCCUPIED BY A SMALL BUBBLE OF AIR WHICH IS INTRODUCED INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE HORIZONTAL PART OF THE TUBE BUT IT DOES NOT ANSWER SO WELL AS THOSE WHICH CONTAIN ONLY A VERY SMALL QUANTITY OF THAT LIQUID SUFFICIENT TO FORM A SMALL BUBBLE BUT WITHOUT ENLARGING ANY FARTHER AT PRESENT ON THE CON STRUCTION OF THESE INSTRUMENTS I NOW PROCEED TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF THE EXPERIMENTS FOR WHICH THEY WERE CONTRIVED HAVING FOUND ABUNDANT REASON TO CONCLUDE FROM THE RESULTS OF THE EXPERIMENTS OF WHICH AN ACCOUNT HAS ALREADY BEEN GIVEN P 2108 COUNT RUMFORDS ENQUIRY CONCERNING THE NATURE OF HEAT THAT ALL THE HEAT WHICH A HOT BODY LOSES WHEN IT IS EXPOSED IN THE AIR TO COOL IS NOT GIVEN OFF TO THE AIR WHICH COMES INTO CONS TACT WITH IT BUT THAT A LARGE PROPORTION OF IT ESCAPES IN RAYS WHICH DO NOT HEAT THE TRANSPARENT AIR THROUGH WHICH THEY PASS BUT LIKE LIGHT GENERATE HEAT ONLY WHEN AND WHERE THEY ARE STOPPEDC AND ABSORBED I SUSPECTED THAT IN EVERY CASE WHEN IN THE FOREGOING EXPERIMENTS THE COOLING OF MY INSTRUMENTS WAS EXPEDITED BY COVERINGS APPLIED TO THEIR METALLIC SURFACES THOSE COVERINGS MUST BY SOME MEANS OR OTHER HAVE FACILITATED AND ACCELERATED THE EMISSION OF CALORIFIC RAYS FROM THE HOT SURFACE TRHOSE SUSPICIONS IMPLIED IT IS TRUE THE SUPPOSITION THAT DIF FERENT SUBSTANCES HEATED TO THE SAME TEMPERATURE EMIT UNEQUAL QUANTITIES OF CALORIFIC RAYS BUT I SAW NO REASON WHY THIS MIGHT NOT BE THE CASE IN FACT AND I HASTENED TO MAKE THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTS WHICH PUT THE MATTER BEYOND ALL DOUBT EXPER NO 12 TWO EQUAL CYLINDRICAL VESSELS MADE OF SHEET BRASS AND POLISHED VERY BRIGHT EACH 3 INCHES IN DIAMETER AND 4 INCHES LONG SUSPENDED BY THEIR OBLIQUE NECKS IN A HORIZONTAL POSITION BEING PLACED ON THEIR WOODEN STANDS WERE FILLED WITH WATER AT THE TEMPERATURE OF 1800 AND THEIR CIRCULAR FLAT BOTTOMS WERE PRESENTED IN A VERTICAL POSITION TO THE TWO BALLS OF THE THERMOSCOPE AT THE DISTANCE OF 2 INCHES WHEN THE TWO HOT BODIES WERE PRESENTED AT THE SAME MOMENT TO THE TWO BALLS OF THE INSTRUMENT OR WHAT WAS STILL BETTER WHEN TWO SCREENS WERE PLACED BEFORE THE TWO BALLS AT THE DIS TANCE OF ABOUT AN INCH AND AFTER THE HOT BODIES WERE PLACED THESE SCREENS WERE BOTH REMOVED AT THE SAME INSTANT THE SMALL COLUMN OF SPIRIT OF WINE WHICH I HAVE CALLED A BUBBLE REMAINED IMMOVEABLE IN ITS PLACE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HORIZONTAL PART OF THE TUBE OF THE INSTRUMENTAND THE MODE OFITS COMMUNICATION 109 IF ONE OF THE HOT BODIES WAS NOW BROUGHT NEARER THE BALL TO WHICH IT WAS PRESENTED THE OTHER HOT BODY REMAINING IN ITS PLACE THE BUBBLE IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO MOVE FROM THE HOT BODY WHICH WAS ADVANCED FORWARD TOWARDS THE OPPOSITE BALL TO WHICH THE OTHER HOT BODY WAS PRESENTED IF INSTEAD OF ADVANCING ONE OF THE HOT BODIES NEARER THE BALL TO WHICH IT WAS PRESENTED IT WAS DRAWN BACKWARD TO A GREATER DISTANCE FROM IT THE ACTION OF ITS CALORIFIC RAYS ON THE BALL WAS DIMINISHED BY THIS INCREASE OF DISTANCE AND BEING OVERCOME BY THE ACTION OF THE RAYS FROM THE HOT BODY PRESENTED TO THE OP POSITE BALL AT A SMALLER DISTANCE THE BUBBLE WAS FORCED OUT OF ITS PLACE AND OBLIGED TO MOVE TOWARDS THE BALL WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN BACKWARD WHEN ONE OF THE HOT BODIES ONLY WAS PRESENTED TO ONE OF THE BALLS THE BUBBLE WAS IMMEDIATELY PUT IN MOTION AND BY BRINGING THE HOT BODY NEARER TO THE BALL IT MIGHT BE DRIVEN QUITE OUT OF THE TUBE INTO THE OPPOSITE BALL THIS HOWEVER SHOULD NEVER BE DONE BECAUSE IT TOTALLY DERANGES THE INSTRU MENT AS IT IS EASY TO PERCEIVE IT MUST DO HAVING BY THESE TRIALS ASCERTAINED THE SENSIBILITY AND THE ACCURACY OF MY INSTRUMENT I NOW PROCEEDED TO MAKE THE FOL LOWING DECISIVE EXPERIMENT EXPER NO 13 HAVING BLACKENED THE FLAT CIRCULAR BOTTOM OF ONE OF THE CYLINDRICAL VESSELS BY HOLDING IT OVER THE FLAME OF A WAX CANDLE I NOW FILLED BOTH VESSELS AGAIN WITH WATER AT THE TEMPERATURE OF I 80 F AND PRESENTED THEM AS BEFORE TO THE TWO OPPOSITE BALLS OF THE INSTRUMENT AT EQUAL DISTANCES THE BUBBLE WAS INSTANTLY DRIVEN OUT OF ITS PLACE BY THE SUPERIOR ACTION OF THE BLACKENED SURFACE AND DID NOT RETURN TO ITS FORMER STATION TILL AFTER THE VESSELWHICH WAS BLACKENED11O COUNT RIFUMFORDWS ENQUIRY CONCERNING THENATU RE OF HEAT HAD BEEN REMOVED TO MORE THAN 8 INCHES FROM THE BALL TOAWHICH IT WAS PRESENTED THE OTHER VESSEL WHICH HAD NOT BEEN BLACKENED REMAINING IN ITS FORMER SITUATION AT THE DISTANCE OF 2 INCHES FROM ITS BALL THE RESULT OF THIS EXPERIMENT APPEARED TO ME TO THROW A NEW LIGHT ON THE SUBJECT WHICH HAD SO LONG ENGAGED MY ATTENTION  AND TO PRESENT A WIDE AND VERY INTERESTING FIELD FOR FARTHER INVESTIGATION I COULD NOW ACCOUNT IN A MANNER SOMEWHAT MORE SATISFACTORY FOR THOSE APPEARANCES IN THE FOREGOING EXPERIMENTS WHICH WERE SO DIFFICULT TO EXPLAINFOR THE ACCELERATION OF THE PASSAGE OF THE HEAT OUT OF MY INSTRUMENTS WHICH RESULTED FROM COVERING THEM WITH LINEN VARNISH C AND I IMMEDIATELY SET ABOUT MAKING A VARIETY OF NEW EXPERIMENTS FROM WHICH I CONCEIVED I SHOULD ACQUIRE A FARTHER INSIGHT INTO THOSE INVISIBLE MECHANICAL OPERA TIONS WHICH TAKE PLACE WHEN BODIES ARE HEATED AND COOLED FINDING SO GREAT A DIFFERENCE IN THE QUANTITIES OF CALORIFIC RAYS WHICH ARE THROWN OFF BY THE POLISHED SURFACE OF A METAL WHENR EXPOSED NAKED TO THE COLD AIR AND WHEN BLACKENED I NOW PRO CEEDED TO MAKE EXPERIMENTS TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER OR NOT ALL THOSE SUBSTANCES WITH WHICH THE SIDES OF MY CYLINDRICAL VESSELS HAD BEEN COVERED AND WHICH HAD BEEN FOUND TO EXPEDITE THE COOLING OF THOSE INSTRUMENTS WOULD ALSO FACILITATE THE EMISSION OF CALORIFIC RAYS FROM THE SURFACES OF THE INSTRUMENTS I PRESENTED TO THE BALLS OF MY THERMOSCOPE AND I FOUND THIS TO BE THE CASE IN FACT AS THE RESULTS OF ALL THESE EXPERIMENTS PROVED IN THE MOST DECISIVE MANNER THAT ALL THE SUBSTANCES WHICH WHEN APPLIED TO THE METALLIC SURFACES OF MY LARGE CYLINDRICAL VESSELS HAD EXPE DITED THEIR COOLING FACILITATED AND EXPEDITED THE EMISSION OFEAND THE MODE OF ITS COMMUNICATION III CALORIFIC RAYS I COULD NO LONGER ENTERTAIN ANY DOUBTS RESPECTING THE AGENCY OF RADIATION IN THE HEATING AND COOLING OF BODIES MANY IMPORTANT POINTS HOWEVER STILL REMAINED TO BE INVESTIGATED BEFORE DISTINCT AND SATISFACTORY IDEAS COULD BE FORMED RESPECTING THE NATURE OF THOSE RAYS AND THE MODE OF THEIR ACTION I HAD HITHERTO MADE USE OF BUT ONE METAL BRASS IN MY EX PERIMENTS AND THAT WAS NOT A SIMPLE BUT A COMPOUND METAL THE FIRST SUBJECT OF ENQUIRY WHICH PRESENTED ITSELF IN THE PRO SECUTION OF THESE RESEARCHES WAS TO FIND OUT WHETHER OR NOT SIMILAR EXPERIMENTS MADE WITH OTHER METALS XVOULD GIRE SIMILAR RESULTS EXPER NO I P ROCURING FROM A GOLDBEATER A QUANTITY OF LEAF GOLD AND LEAF SILVER ABOUT THREE TIMES AS THICK AS THAT WHICH IS COMMONLY USED BY GILDERS I COVERED THE SURFACES OF THE TWO LARGE CYLINDRICAL VESSELS NO I AND NO 2 WITH A SINGLE COATING OF OIL VARNISH AND WHEN IT WAS SUFFICIENTLY DRY FOR MY PURPOSE I GILT THE INSTRUMENT NO T WITH THE GOLD LEAF AND CO VERED THE OTHER NO 2 WITH SILVER LEAF WHEN THE VARNISH WAS PERFECTLY DRY AND HARD I WIPED THE INSTRUMENTS WITH COTTON TO REMOVE THE SUPERFLUOUS PARTICLES OF THE GOLD AND SILVER AND THEN REPEATED THE EXPERIMENT SO OFTEN MENTIONED OF FILLING THE INSTRUMENTS WITH BOILING HOT WATER AND EXPOSING THEMN TO COOL IN THE AIR OF A LARGE QUIET ROOM THE TIME OF COOLING THROUGH THE GIVEN INTERVAL OF IO DEGREES WAS JUST THE SAME AS IT WAS BEFORE WHEN THE NATURAL SURFACE OF THESE BRASS VESSELS WAS EXPOSED NAKED TO THE AIR I REPEATED THE EXPERIMENT SEVERAL TIMES BUT COULD NOT FIND THAT THE DIFFERENCE IN THE METALS MADE ANY DIFFERENCE IN THE TIMES OF COOLING EXPER NO 5 NOT SATISFIED TO REST THE DETERMINATION OF SO IMPORTANT A POINT ON A TRIAL WITH THREE METALS ONLY BRASS GOLDI12 COUNT RUMFORDS ENQUIRY CONCERNING THE NATURE OF HEAT AND SILVER I NOW PROVIDED MYSELF WITH TWO NEW INSTRUMENTS THE ONE MADE OF LEAD AND THE OTHER COVERED WITH TINNED SHEET IRON IMPROPERLY IN ENGLAND CALLED TIN AS THE CONDUCTING POWER OF LEAD WITH RESPECT TO HEAT IS MUCH GREATER THAN THAT OF ANY OTHER METAL I CONCEIVED THAT IF THE RADIATION OF A BODY WERE ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH ITS CONDUCTING POWER THE COOLING OF THE WATER CONTAINED IN THE LEADEN VESSEL WOULD NECESSARILY BE EITHER MORE OR LESS RAPID THAN IN A VESSEL CONSTRUCTED OF ANY OTHER METAL THE RESULT OF THIS EXPERIMENT AS ALSO THE RESULTS OF SEVERAL OTHERS SIMILAR TO IT SHOWED THAT HEAT IS GIVEN OFF WITH THE SAME FACILITY OR WITH THE SAME CELERITY FROM THE SURFACES OF ALL THE METALS IS NOT THIS OWING TO THEIR BEING ALL EQUALLY WANTING IN TRANSPARENCY  AND DOES NOT THIS AFFORD US A STRONG PRESUMPTION THAT HEAT IS IN ALL CASES EXCITED AND COMMUNICATED BY MEANS OF RADIATIONS OR UNDULATIONS AS I SHOULD RATHER CHOOSE TO CALL THEM I AM SENSIBLE HOWEVER THAT THERE IS ANOTHER AND MOST IM PORTANT QUESTION TO BE DECIDED BEFORE THESE POINTS CAN BE DETER MINED AND THAT IS WHETHER BODIES ARE COOLED IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE RAYS THEY EMIT OR BY THOSE THEY RECEIVE THE CELEBRATED EXPERIMENT OF PROFESSOR PICTET WHICH HAS OFTEN BEEN REPEATED APPEARS TO ME TO HAVE PUT THE FACT BEYOND ALL DOUBT THAT RAYS OR EMANATIONS WHICH LIKE LIGHT MAY BE CONCENTRATED BY CONCAVE MIRRORS PROCEED FROM COLD BODIES AND THAT THESE RAYS WHEN SO CONCENTRATED ARE CAPABLE OF AFFECTING IN A MANNER PERFECTLY SENSIBLE A DELICATE AIR THERMO METER ONE OF THE OBJECTS I HAD PRINCIPALLY IN VIEW IN CONTRIVING THEAND THE MODE OF ITS COMMUNICATION 113 BEFORE DESCRIBED INSTRUMENT WHICH I HAVE CALLED A THERMOSCOPE WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE NATURE AND PROPERTIES OF THOSE EMANATIONS AND TO FIND OUT IF POSSIBLE WHETHER THEY ARE NOT OF THE SAME NATURE AS THOSE CALORIFIC RAYS WHICH HAVE LONG BEEN KNOWN TO PROCEED FROM HOT BODIES MY FIRST ATTEMPTS IN THESE INVESTIGATIONS WERE TO ASCERTAIN THE EXISTENCE OF THOSE EMANATIONS UNIVERSALLY AND TO DISCOVER WHAT VISIBLE EFFECTS THEY MIGHT BE MADE TO PRODUCE INDEPENDENTLY OF CONCENTRATION BY MEANS OF CONCAVE MIRRORS EPER NO 16 MY TWO HORIZONTAL CYLINDRICAL VESSELS OF SHEET BRASS OF THE SAME FORM AND DIMENSIONS HAVING BEEN MADE VERY CLEAN AND BRIGHT WERE FIXED TO THEIR STANDS AND BEING ELEVATED TO A PROPER HEIGHT TO BE PRESENTED TO THE BALLS OF THE THERMOSCOPE WERE SET DOWN NEAR THAT INSTRUMENT WHICH WAS PLACED ON A TABLE IN A LARGE QUIET ROOM WHERE THEY WERE SUF FERED TO REMAIN

MANNER THAT ITS BALLS WERE COMPLETELY DEFENDED FROM THOSE RAYS THINGS HAVING BEEN THUS PREPARED I ENTERED THE ROOM AS GENTLY AS POSSIBLE IN ORDER NOT TO PUT THE AIR OF THE ROOM IN MOTION AND

AND TAKING IT INTO ANOTHER ROOM I FILLED IT WITH POUNDED ICE AND WATER ENTERING THE ROOM AGAIN I NOW PRESENTED THE FLAT VERTICAL BOTTOM OF THIS HORIZONTAL CYLINDRICAL VESSEL FILLED WITH ICE AND WATER

GENERATING COLD IN WARMER BODIES WHICH ARE EXPOSED TO THEIR INFLUENCE YET IN A MATTER SO EXTREMELY CURIOUS AND OF SUCH HIGH IMPORTANCE TO THE SCIENCE OF HEAT I WAS NOT WILLING TO REST MY ENQUIRIES ON THE RESULT OF A SINGLE EXPERIMENT IN ORDER TO VARY THE SUBSTANCE OR SPECIES OF MATTER PRESENTED COLD TO THE INSTRUMENT AND AT THE SAME TIME TO REMOVE ALL SUSPICION RESPECTING THE POSSIBILITY OF THE EFFECTS OBSERVED BEINGIXDD THE MODE OF ITS COMMUNICATION L 1I PRODUCED BY CURRENTS OF COLD AIR OCCASIONED IN THE ROOM BY THE PRESENCE OF THE COLD BODY I NOW REPEATED THE EXPERINENT WITH THE FOLLOWING VARIATIONS THE TBERMOSCOPE WAS LAID DOWN ON ONE SIDE SO THAT THE TWO ENDS OF ITS TUBE TO WHICH ITS BALLS WERE ATTACHED INSTEAD OF BEING VERTICAL WERE NOW IN A HORIZONTAL POSITION L AND THE COLD BODY INSTEAD OF BEING PRESENTED TO THE BALL OF THE INSTRUMENT ON ONE SIDE OF IT AND ON THE SAME HORIZONTAL LEVEL WITH IT WAS NOW PLACED DIRECTLY UNDER IT AND AT THE DISTANCE OF 6 INCHES THIS COLD BODY INSTEAD OF BEING A METALLIC SUBSTARNCE WAS A SOLID CAKE OF ICE CIRCULAR FLAT AND ABOUT 8 INCHES THICK AND 8 INCHES IN DIAMETER IT WAS PLACED IN A SHALLOW EARTHEN DISH ABOUT 9 INCHES IN DIAMETER BELOW 12 INCHES IN DIAMETER ABOVE AT ITS BRIM AND 4 INCHES DEEP THE CAKE OF ICE BEING LAID DOWN ON THE BOTTOM OF THE DISH THE TOP OF THE DISH WAS COVERED BY A CIRCULAR PIECE OF THICK PAPER 14 INCHES IN DIAMETER WHICH HAD A CIRCULAR HOLE IN ITS CENTRE JUST 6 INCHES IN DIAMETER THIS EARTHEN DISH CONTAINING THE ICE AND THUS COVERED WAS PLACED PERPENDICULARLY UNDER ONE OF THE BALLS OF THE THERMOS SCOPE AT SUCH A DISTANCE THAT THE CENTRE OF THE UPPER SURFACE OF THE FLAT CAKE OF ICE WAS 6 INCHES BELOW THE BALL THE RESULT OF THIS EXPERIMENT WAS JUST WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED THE ICE W AS NO SOONER PLACED UNDER THE BALL OF THE INSTRUMENT THAN THE BUBBLE OF SPIRIT OF WINE BEGAN TO MOVE TOWARDS THAT SIDE WHERE THE COLD BODY WAS PLACED AND IT DID NOT REMAIN STATIONARY TILL AFTER IT HAD ADVANCED MORE THAN AN INCH IN THE TUBE EXPER NO 19 DESIROUS OF DISCOVERING WHETHER THE SURFACE OF A LIQUID EMITS FRIGORIFIC OR CALORIFIC RAYS AS SOLID LO LIES HAVE BEEN FOUND TO DO I NOW REMOVED THE CAKE OF ICE FROM THE Q2I I6 COUNT RUMFORDS ENQUIRY CONCERNING THE NATURE OF HEAT EARTHEN DISH AND REPLACED IT WITH AN EQUAL MASS OF ICECOLD WATER THE RESULT OF THIS EXPERIMENT WAS TO ALL APPEARANCE JUST THE SAME AS THAT OF THE LAST THE BUBBLE MOVED TOWARDS THE COLD BODY AND TOOK ITS STATION IN THE SAME PLACE WHERE IT HAD RE MAINED STATIONARY BEFORE I FOUND REASON HOWEVER TO CONCLUDE AFTER MEDITATING ON THE SUBJECT THAT ALTHOUGH THE LAST EXPERIMENT PROVES IN A MOST DECISIVE MANNER THAT RADIATIONS ACTUALLY PRO CEED FROM THE SURFACE OF WATER YET THE PROOF OF THE RADIATION FROM THE SURFACE OF ICE AFFORDED BY THE PRECEDING EXPERIMENT IS NOT EQUALLY CONCLUSIVE FOR AS THE TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR OF THE ROOM IN WHICH THESE EXPERIMENTS WERE MADE WAS MANY DEGREES ABOVE THE FREEZING POINT IT IS POSSIBLE AND EVEN PRO BABLE THAT THE SURFACE OF THE ICE WAS ACTUALLY COVERED WITH A VERY THIN AND CONSEQUENTLY INVISIBLE COATING OF WATER DURING THE WHOLE OF THE TIME THE EXPERIMENT LASTED FINDING REASON TO CONCLUDE THAT FRIGORIFIC RAYS ARE ALWAYS EMITTED BY COLD BODIES AND THAT THESE EMANATIONS ARE VERY ANA LOGOUS TO THE CALORIFIC RAYS WHICH HOT BODIES EMIT I WAS IMPA TIENT TO DISCOVER WHETHER ALL COLD BODIES AT THE SAME TEMPERATURE EMIT THE SAME QUANTITY OF RAYS OR WHETHER AS I HAD FOUND TO BE THE CASE WITH RESPECT TO THE CALORIFIC RAYS EMITTED BY HOT BODIES SOME SUBSTANCES EMIT MORE OF THEM AND SOME LESS WITH A VIEW TO THE ASCERTAINING OF THIS IMPORTANT POINT I MADE THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTS EXPER NO GO HAVING FOUND THAT A METALLIC SURFACE RENDERED QUITE BLACK BY HOLDING IT OVER THE FLAME OF A WAX CANDLE EMITS A MUCH LARGER QUANTITY OF CALORIFIC RAYS WHEN HOT THAN THE SAME METAL AT THE SAME TEMPERATURE THROWS OFF WHEN NAKED I WAS VERY CURIOUS TO FIND OUT WHETHER BLACKENING THE SURFACE OFAND THE MODE OF ITS COMNMUNICATION I A COLD METAL WOULD OR WOULD NOT INCREASE IN LIKE MANNER THE QUANTITY OF FRIGORIFIC RAYS EMITTED BY IT HAVING BLACKENED IN THE MANNER ALREADY DESCRIBED THE FLAT BOTTOM OR RATHER END OF ONE OF MY HORIZONTAL CYLINDRICAL BRASS VESSELS WITH AN OBLIQUE NECK I FILLED IT WITH A MIXTURE OF ICE AND COMMON SALT AND FILLING ANOTHER VESSEL OF THE SAME KIND THE BOTTOM OF WHICH WAS NOT BLACKENED WITH THE SAME COLD MIXTURE I PRESENTED THEM BOTH AT THE SAME INSTANT AND AT THE SAME DISTANCE TO THE TWO OPPOSITE BALLS OF MY THERMOSCOPE THE RESULT OF THIS EXPERIMENT WAS PERFECTLY CONCLUSIVE THE BUBBLE OF SPIRIT OF WINE BEGAN IMMEDIATELY TO MOVE TOWARDS THE BALL TO WHICH THE BLACKENED COLD BODY WAS PRESENTED INDICATING THEREBY THAT THAT BALL WAS MORE COOLED BY THE FRIGORIFIC RAYS WHICH PROCEEDED FROM THE BLACKENED SURFACE THAN THE OPPOSITE BALL WAS COOLED BY THE RAYS WHICH PROCEEDED FROM AN EQUAL SURFACE OF NAKED METAL AT THE SAME TEMPERATURE AS THIS EXPERIMENT APPEARED TO ME TO BE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE I REPEATED IT SEVERAL TIMES AND ALWAYS WITH THE SAME RESULTS THE MOTION OF THE BUBBLE WHICH CONSTITUTED THE INDEX OF THE INSTRUMENT CONSTANTLY SHOWING THAT THE FRIGORIFIC RAYS FROM THE BLACKENED SURFACE WERE MORE POWERFIUL IN GENERATING COLD THAN THOSE WHICH PROCEEDED FROM THE NAKED METAL THE BUBBLE IT IS TRUE DID NOT MOVE SO FAR OUT OF ITS PLACE AS IT HAD DONE IN THE EXPERIMENTS IN WHICH HOT BODIES WERE PRESENTED TO THE BALLS  BUT THIS WAS NOT TO BE EXPECTED FOR THOUGH I HAD TAKEN PAINS BY MIXING SALT WITH THE ICE TO PRODUCE AS GREAT A DEGREE OF COLD AS I CONVENIENTLY COULDH YET STILL THE DFFIRENCE BETWEEN THE TEMPERATURE OF THE BALLS AND THAT OF THE BODIES PREA SENTED TO THEM WAS MUCH GREATER WHEN THE HOT BODIES WERE USED THAN WHEN THE EXPERIMENTS WERE MADE WITH THE COLD BODIESI I8 COUNT RUMFORDS ENQUIRY CONCERNIN THE NATTURE OF FEAT AND IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE DISTANCE TO WHICH THE BUBBLE IS DRIVEN OUT OF ITS PLACE MUST NECESSARILY BE GREATER OR LESS IN PROPOR TION AS THAT DIFFERENCE IS GREATER OR LESS IN THOSE EXPERIMENTS IN WXHICH THE HORIZONTAL CYLINDRICAL VESSELS WERE FILLED WITH HOT WATER AND THEN PRESENTED TO THE BALLS OF THE INSTRUMENT THE TEMPERATURE OF THE CIRCULAR FLAT SUR FACES WAS THAT OF 1 8E WHILE TEILE TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR OF THE ROOM IN WHICH THOSE EXPERIMENTS WERE MADE AND CONSEQUENTLY THAT OF THE BALLS WAS ABOUT 60 THE DIFFERENCE AMOUNTS TO NO LESS THAN 20 DEGREES OF FAHRENHEITS SCALE BUT IN THESE EXPERI MENTS WITH COLD THE DIFFERENCE OF THE TEMPERATURES AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE COLD BODIES WERE FIRST PRESENTED TO THE INSTRUMENT DID NOT PROBABLY AMOUNT TO MORE THAN 40 OR AT THE MOST 5O DE GREES AND IN A VERY FEW SECONDS IT MUST HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO LESS THAN SO DEGREES IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE FREEZING OF THE WATER PRECIPITATED BY THE AIR OF THE ATMOSPHERE ON THE SURFACE OF THE VESSEL CONTAINING THE COLD MIXTURE THIS PRECIPITATION OF WATER BY THE SURROUNDING AIR WAS SO COPIOUS THAT THE BRILLIANCY OF THE POLISH OF THE METALLIC SURFACE WAS ALMOST INSTANTLY OBSCURED BY IT AND THE VESSELS WERE VERY SOON COVERED WITH A THICK COAT OF ICE THESE ACCIDENTS WHICH WERE NOT TO BE PREVENTED AFFECTED IN A VERY SENSIBLE MANNER THE RESULTS OF THE EXPERIMNENT THE BUBBLE INSTEAD OF REMAINING STATIONARY FOR SOME TIME AFTER IT HAD REACHED THE POINT OF ITS GREATEST ELONGATION AS IT HAD DONE IN THE EXPERI MENTS WITH HOT BODIES HAD NO SOONER REACHED THAT POINT THAN IT BEGAN TO RETURN BACK TOWARDS THE PLACE FROM WHICH IT HAD SET OUT AND AS OFTEN AS I WIPED OFF THE ICE FROM THE SURFACE OF THE FLAT END OF THE VESSEL WHICH WAS NOT BLACKENED AND PRESENTED IT LEAN AND BRIGHT TO THEBALL OF THE INSTRUMENT THE BUBBLE BEGANAND TIE LODE OF ITS COMMUNICATION 119 AGAIN TO MOVE TOWARDS THE OPPOSITE SIDE WHICH BY THE BYE SHOWS THAT ICE EMITS A GREATER QUANTITY OF FRIGORIFIC RAYS THAN A BRIHT METALLIC SURFACE AT THE SAME TEMPERATURE IHAVING FREQUENTLY OBSERVED ON PRESENTING MY HAND TO ONE OF THE BALLS OF THE THERMOSCOPE THAT THE INSTRUMENT WAS GREATLY AFFICTED BY THE CALORIFIC RAYS WHICH PROCEEDED FROM IT APPARENTLY MUCH MORE SO THAN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BY A MUCH HOTTER BODY OF THE SAME QUANTITY OF SURFACE BUT OF A DIFFERENT KIND OF SUB STANCE PLACED AT THE SAME DISTANCE I WAS EXTREMELY CURIOUS TO FIND OUT WHETHER ANIMAL SUBSTANCES DO NOT EMIT CALORIFIC AND CONSEQUENTLY FRIGORIFIC RAYS MUCH MORE COPIOUSLY THAN OTHER SUBSTANCES  AND WHETH ER LIVING ANIMAL BODIES DO NOT EMIT THEM IN GREATER ABUNDANCE THAN DEAD ANIMAL MATTER THE FIRST EXPERIMENT I MADE WITH A VIEW TO THE INVESTIGATION OF THIS PARTICULAR POINT WAS AS SIMUPLE AS ITS RESULT WAS STRIKING AND CONCIUSIVC EXPER NO 2 I HAVING PROCURED A PIECE OF GOLDBEATERS SKIN WHICH AS IS WELL KNOW N IS ONE OF THE MEMBRANES THAT LINE THE LARGER INTESTINES IN CATTLE AND IS EXCEEDINGLY THIN I MOISTS ENED IT WITH WATER AND APPLYING IT WHILE MOIST TO THE FLAT CIRCULAR END OF ONE OF MY HORIZONTAL CYLINDRICAL VESSELS IT RE MAINED FIRMLY ATTACHED TO THE SURFACE OF THE NMETAL WHEN IT BECAME DRY I NOW FILLED THIS VESSEL AND ANOTHER OF EQUAL DIMEN SIONS THE END OF WHICH WAS NOT COVERED WITH HOT WATER AT THE TEMPERATURE OF 1800 AND PRESENTED THEM BOTH AT THE SAME MOMENT TO THE TWO BALLS OF THE TLHERMNOSCOPE AND AT THE SAME DISTANCE THE BUBBLE OF SPIRIT OF WINE WAS IMMEDIATELY DRIVEN OUT OF ITS PLACE TO A GREAT DISTANCE AND DID NOT RETURN TO ITS FORMER STATION TILL AFTER THE VESSEL WHOSE END WAS COVERED WITH GOLDINO CONT RUMRODS ENQUYR CONCERNING TBE NATURE OF HEAT BEATERS SKIN HAD BEEN REMOVED TO A DISTANCE FROM THE BALL TO WHICH IT WAS PRESENTED WHICH WASFIVE TIMES GREATER THAN THE DISTANCE AT WHICH THE OTHER VESSEL WAS PLACED FROM THE OPPOSITE BALL I WAS INDUCED TO CONCLUDE FROM THE RESULT OF THIS INTERESTING EXPERIMENT THAT AN ANIMAL SUBSTANCE EMITS 25 TIMES MORE CALORIFIC RAYS THAN A POLISHED METALLIC SURFACE OF THE SAME DIM MENSIONS BOTH SUBSTANCES BEING AT THE SAME TEMPERATURE EXPER NO 22 HAVING EMPTIED BOTH THE VESSELS USED IN THE LAST EXPERIMENT AND REFILLED THEM W 1TH POUNDED ICE AND WATER I NOW PRESENTED THEM AGAIN TO THE THERMOSCOPE AT EQUAL DIS TANCES FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE BALLS THE RESULT OF THIS EXPERIMENT CONFIRMED THE CONCLUSION I HAD BEEN INDUCED TO DRAW FROM A FORMER EXPERIMENT OF THE SAME KIND NO 13 THE NOTION OF THE BUBBLE TOWARDS THE VESSEL WHOSE SURFACE WAS COVERED WITH GOLDBEATERS SKIN SHOWVING THAT THE RAYS WHICH PROCEEDED FROM THAT ANIMAL SUBSTANCE WERE CON SIDERABLY MORE EFFICACIOUS IN PRODUING COLD THAN THOSE WHICH PROCEEDED FROM THE NAKED METAL THE RADIATION OF COLD BODIES APPEARING TO ME TO HAVE BEEN PROVED BEYOND ALL DOUBT BY THE PRECEDING EXP RIINENTS I NOW SET ABOUT TO INVESTIGATE A VEY IMPORTANT POINT WXHICH SHTI1L RE MA NED TO BE DETERMINED I ENDEAVOURED TO FIND OUT WHETHER THE INTENSITY OF THE ACTION OF THE FRIGORIFIC RAYS WHILCH PROCEED FROM COLD BODIES OR THEIR POWER OF AFFECTING THE TERNPERATURES OF OTIER WARMER BODIES AT EQUAL INTERVALS OF TEMPERATURE IS OR IS NOT EQUAL TO THE INTENSITY OF THE ACTION OF THE ALORIFIC RAYS WHICH PROCEED FROM HOT BODIES TO ASCERTAIN THIS POINT I MADE THE FOLLOWING VERY SIMPLE AND DECISIVE EXPERIMENT FXPER NO 2AD HAVING P LACED THE THERMOSCOPE ON A TABLE INAND THE MODE OF ITS COMNMUNICATION 121 THE MIDDLE OF A LARGE QUIET ROOM AT THE TEMPERATURE OF 720 F I PRESENTED TO ONE OF ITS BALLS AT THE DISTANCE OF 3 INCHES THE FLAT CIRCULAR END OF ONE OF THE HORIZONTAL CYLINDRICAL VESSELS A ABOVE DESCRIBED WITH AN OBLIQUE CYLINDRICAL NECK THIS VESSEL BEING FILLED WITH POUNDED ICE AND WATER AND AT THE SAME MO MENT AN ASSISTANT PRESENTED TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE SAME BALL OF THE THERMOSCOPE AT THE SAME DISTANCE 3 INCHES THE FLAT END OF THE OTHER SIMILAR AND EQUAL CYLINDRICAL VESSEL B FILLED WITH WARM WATER AT THE TEMPERATURE OF I 12T F THE OPPOSITE BALL OF THE THERMOSCOPE BEING HID AND DEFENDED BY MEANS OF SCREENS FROM THE ACTIONS OF THE BODIES PRESENTED TO THE OTHER BALL AS ALSO FROM THE CALORIFIC RAYS WHICH PROCEEDED FROM THE BODIES OF THE PERSONS PRESENT FROM THIS DESCRIPTION IT APPEARS THAT WHILE ONE OF THE BALLS OF THE THERMOSCOPE WAS SO DEFENDED BY SCREENS THAT IT COULD NOT BE SENSIBLY AFFECTED BY THE RADIATIONS OF THE NEIGHBOURING BODIES THE OTHER BILL WAS EXPOSED TO THE SIMULTANEOUS ACTION OF TWO EQUAL BODIES AT EQUAL DISTANCES TWO VERTICAL METALLIC DISKS 3 INCHES IN DIAMETER PLACED ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE BALL AT THE DIS TANCE OF 3 INCHES ONE OF THESE BODIES BEING AT THE TEMPERATURE OF 3OQ F OR 40 DEGREES BELOW THAT OF THE BALL WHILE THE OTHER WAS AT 1 I2 F OR 40 DEGREES ABOVE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE BALL I KNEW FROM THE RESULTS OF FORMER EXPERIMENTS THAT THIS BALL WOULD AT THE SAME TIME BE HEATED BY THE CALORIFIC RAYS FROM THE HOT BODY AND COOLED BY THE FRIGORIFIC RAYS FROM THE COLD BODY AND I CONCLUDED THAT IF ITS MEAN TEMPERATURE SHOULD REMAIN UNCHANGED UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THESE TWO OPPOSITE ACTIONS THAT EVENT WOULD BE A DECISIVE PROOF OF THE EQUALITY OF THE INTENSITIES OF THOSE ACTIONS THE RESULT OF THE EXPERIMENT SHOWED THAT THE INTENSITIES OF MDCCCIV R122 FCOUNT RUMFORDS ENQUIRY CONCERNING THE NATURE OF HEAT THOSE OPPOSITE ACTIONS WERE IN FACT EQUAL THE BUBBLE OF SPIRIT OF WINE WHICH BY ITS MOTION WOULD HAVE INDICATED THE SMALLEST CHANGE OF TEMPERATURE IN THE BALL OF THE THERMOSCOPE TO WHICH THE HOT AND THE COLD BODIES WEREPRESENTED REMAINED AT REST ON REMOVING THE COLD BODY A LITTLE FARTHER FROM THE BALL TO THE DISTANCE OF 3 INCHES FOR INSTANCE THE HOT BODY REMAINING IN ITS FORMER STATION AT THE DISTANCE OF S INCHES THE BUBBLE BEGAN IMMEDIATELY TO MOVE TOWARDS THE OPPOSITE BALL OF THE THERMOSCOPE INDICATING AN INCREASE OF HEAT IN THE BALL EXPOSED TO THE ACTIONS OF THE HOT AND THE COLD BODIES BUT WHEN THE HOT BODY WAS REMOVED TO A GREATER DISTANCE THE COLD BODY REV MAINING IN ITS PLACE THE BUBBLE INDICATED AN INCREASE OF COLD THE CELERITY WITH WHICH THE BALL OF THE THERMOSCOPE ACQUIRED HEAT OR COLD MIGHT BE ESTIMATED BY THE VELOCITY WITH WHICH THE BUBBLE OF SPIRIT OF WINE ADVANCED OR RETIRED IN ITS TUBE BUT ON THE MOST CAREFUL AND ATTENTIVE OBSERVATION I COULD NOT PER CEIVE THAT IT MOVED FASTER WHEN THE BALL WAS ACQUIRING HEAT THAN WHEN IT WAS ACQUIRING COLD  PROVIDED THAT THE HOT AND THE COLD BODIES FROM WHICH THE CALORIFIC AND FRIGORIFIC RAYS PRO CEEDED WERE AT THE SAME RELATIVE DISTANCES FROM THESE EXPERIMENTS WHICH I LATELY REPEATED AT GENEVA IN THE PRESENCE OF PROFESSOR PICTET MONS DE SAUSSURE M SENEBIER AND SEVERAL OTHER PERSONS WE MAY VENTURE TO CON CLUDE THAT AT EQUAL INTERVALS OF TEMPERATURE THE RAYS WHICH GENERATE COLD ARE JUST AS REAL AND JUST AS INTENSE AS THOSE WHICH GENERATE HEAT OR THAT THIIR ACTIONS ARE EQUALLY POWERFUL IN CHANGING THE TEMPERATURES OF NEIGHBOURING BODIES ON A SUPERFICIAL VIEW OF THIS SUBJECT IT MIGHT APPEAR EXTRAOR DINARY THAT SO IMPORTANT A FACT AS THAT OF THE FRIGORIFIC RADIATIONS OF COLD BODIES SHOULD HAVE BEEN SO LONG UNNOTICED WHILE THEAND TJE MODE OF ITS COMMUNICATION 123 CALORIFIC RADIATIONS OF HOT BODIES HAVE BEEN SO WELL KNOWN BUT IF WE CONSIDER THE MATTER WITH ATTENTION OUR SURPRISE WILL CEASE THOSE RADIATIONS BY MEANS OF WHICH THE TEMPERATURES OF NEIGH BOURING BODIES ARE GRADUALLY CHANGED AND EQUALIZED ARE NOT SENSIBLE TO OUR FEELING UNLESS THE INTERVALS OF TEMPERATURE BE VERY CONSIDERABLE AND THE CONSTITUTION OF THINGS IS SUCH THAT WHILE WE ARE OFTEN EXPOSED TO THE INFLUENCE OF BODIES HEATED SEVERAL THOUSAND DEGREES AS MEASURED BY THE THERMOMETER ABOVE THE MEAN TEMPERATURE OF THE SURFACE OF THE SKIN IT IS VERY SELDOM THAT WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES OF EXPERIENCING THE EFFECTS OF THE RADIATIONS OF BODIES MUCH COLDER THAN OURSELVES AND WE HAVE NO MEANS OF PRODUCING DEGREES OF COLD WHICH BEAR ANY PROPORTION TO THE INTENSE HEATS EXCITED BY MEANS OF FIRE FROM THE RESULT OF THE EXPERIMENT OF WHICH AN ACCOUNT HAS JUST BEEN GIVEN IT IS EVIDENT THAT WE SHOULD BE JUST AS MUCH AFFECTED BY THE CALORIFIC RAYS EMITTED BY A CANNON BULLET AT THE TEMPERATURE OF 16O DEGREES OF FA1IRENHEITS SCALE 64 DEGREES ABOVE THAT OF THE BLOOD AS BY THE FRIGORIFIC RAYS OF AN EQUAL BULLET ICE COLD PLACED AT THE SAME DISTANCE AND THAT A BULLET AT THE TEMPERATURE OF FREEZING MERCURY COULD NOT AFFECT US MUCH MORE SENSIBLY BY ITS FRIGORIFIC RAYS THAN AN EQUAL BULLET AT THE TEMPERATURE OF BOILING WATER WOULD DO BY ITS CALORIFIC RAYS BUT AT THESE COMPARATIVELY SMALL INTERVALS OF TEMPERATURE THE RADIA TIONS OF BODIES ARE HARDLY SENSIBLE AND COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN PERCEIVED MUCH LESS COMPARED AND ESTIMATED WITHOUT THE ASSIS TANCE OF INSTRUMENTS MUCH MORE DELICATE THAN OIUR ORGAMS OF FEELING HENCE WE SEE HOW IT HAPPENED THAT THE FRIRORIFIC RA DIATIONS OF COLD BODIES REMAINED SO LONG UNKNOWN THEY WERE SUSPECTED BY BACON BUT THEIR EXISTENCE WAS FIRST ASCERTAINED124 COUNT RUMFORDS ENQUIRY CONCERNING THE NATURE OF HEAT BY AN EXPERIMENT MADE AT FLORENCE TOWARDS THE END OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY XAND IT IS NOT A LITTLE CURIOUS THAT THE LEARNED ACADEMICIANS WHO MADE THAT EXPERIMENT AND WHO MADE IT WITH A DIRECT VIEW TO DETERMINE THE FACT IN QUESTION WERE SO COM PLETELY BLINDED BY THEIR PREJUDICES RESPECTING THE NATURE OF HEAT THAT THEY DID NOT BELIEVE THE REPORT OF THEIR OWN EYES BUT REGRARDING THE REFLECTION AND CONCENTRATION OF COLD WHICH THEY CONSIDERED AS A NEGATIVE QUALITY AS IMPOSSIBLE THEY CONCLUDED THAT THE INDICATION OF SUCH REFLECTION AND CONCENTRATION WHICH THEY OBSERVED MUST NECESSARILY HAVE ARISEN FROM SOME ERROR COMMITTED IN MAKING THE EXPERIMENT HAPPILY FOR THE PROGRESS OF SCIENCE THE MATTER WAS AGAIN TAKEN UP ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO BY PROFESSOR PICTET AND THE INTERESTING FACT WHICH THE FLORENTINE ACADEMICIANS WOULD NOT DISCOVER WAS PUT BEYOND ALL DOUBT BUT STILL THIS INGENIOUS AND ENLIGHTENED PHILOSOPHER DID NOT CONSIDER THE APPEARANCES OF A REFLECTION OF COLD WHICH HE OBSERVED IN HIS EXPERIMENTS AS BEING REAL NOR WAS HE LED BY THEM TO ADMIT THE EXISTENCE OF FRIGORIFIC EMANATIONS FROM COLD BODIES ANALOGOUS TO THOSE CALO RIFIC EMANATIONS FROM HOT BODIES WHICH HE CALLS RADIANT HEAT HE EVERY WHERE SPEAKS OF THE REFLECTION OF COLD BY METALLIC MIRRORS AS BEING MERELY APPARENT  AND IT IS ON THAT SUPPOSITION THAT THE EXPLANATION HE HAS GIVEN OF THE PHENOMENA IS FOUNDED ON A SUPPOSITION THAT THE CALORIC OF MODERN CHEMISTS HAS ANY REAL EXISTENCE AND THAT HEAT OR AN INCREASE OF TEMPERATURE IN ANY BODY IS CAUSED BY AN ACCUMULATION OF THAT SUBSTANCE IN SUCH BODY THE REFLECTION OF COLD WOULD INDEED BE IMPOSSIBLE AND THE SUPPOSITION THAT SUCH AN EVENT HAD TAKEN PLACE WOULD BE ABSURD AND COULD NOT BE ADMITTED HOWEVER STRIKING AND CONVINCING THEAND THE MODE OF ITS COMMUNICATION IDD APPEARANCES MIGHT BE WHICH INDICATED THAT EVENT BUT TO RETURN FROM THIS DIGRESSION HAVING FOUND THAT THE INTENSITY OF THE CALORIFIC RAYS EMITTED BY A HOT BODY AT ANY GIVEN TEMPERATURE DEPENDS MUCH ON THE SURFACE OF SUCH BODYTHAT A POLISHED METALLIC SURFACE FOR IN STANCE THROWS OFF MUCH FEWER RAYS THAN THE SAMUE SURFACE AT THE SAME TEMPERATURE WOULD EMIT IF PAINTED OR BLACKENED IN THE SMOKE OF A LAMP OR CANDLE I WAS DESIROUS OF FINDING OUT WHET VER THE FRIGORIFIC RAYS FROM COLD BODIES ARE AFFECTED IN THE SAMNE MANNER BY THE SAME MEANS AND IN THE SAME DEGREE IT WAS TO ASCERTAIN THAT POINT THAT THE EXPERIMENT NO 20 WAS MADE AND ALTHOUGH THE RESULT OF THAT EXPERIMENT AFFORDED ABUNDANT REASON TO CONCLUDE THAT THOSE SUBSTANCES WHICH WHEN HOT THROW OFF CALORIFIC RAYS IN THE GREATEST ABUNDANCE ACTUALLY THROW OFF GREAT QUANTITIES OF FRIGORIFIC RAYS WHEN THEY ARE COLD YET AS THE RELATIVE QUANTITIES OF THESE RAYS COULD NOT BE EXACTLY DETERMINED BY THAT EXPERIMENT IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN SO IMPORT ANT A FACT I HAD RECOURSE TO THE FOLLOWING SIMPLE CONTRIVANCE EXPER NO 24 HAVING FOUND BY THE RESULT OF THE LAST EX PERIMENT NO 23 THAT THE CALORIFIC EMANATIONS OF A CIRCULAR DISK OF POLISHED BRASS 3 INCHES IN DIAMETER AT THE TEMPERATURE OF 1120 F WERE JUST COUNTERBALANCED BY THE FRIGORIFIC EMANA TIONS OF AN EQUAL DISK OF THE SAME POLISHED METAL AT THE TEM PERATURE OF 32 F PLACED OPPOSITE TO ITSO THAT ONE OF THE BALLS OF THE THERNMOSCOPE PLACED BETWEEN THESE TWO DISKS AT EQUAL DISTANCES WAS JUST AS NMUCH HEATED BY THE ONE AS IT WVAS COOLED BY THE OTHER I NOW BLACKENED THE TWO DISKS BY HOLDING THEM OVER THE FLAME OF A WAX CANDLE ATOD REPEATED THE EXPERIMENT WITH THEM SO BLACKENED126 COUNT RUMFORDS ENQUIRY CONCERNING THE NATURE OF HEAT I KNEW FRONM THE RESULTS OF FORMER EXPERIMENTS THAT THE INTENSITY OF THE CALORIFIC RADIATIONS FROM THE HOT DISK WOULD BE VERY MUCH INCREASED IN CONSEQUENCE OF ITS SURFACE BEING BLACK ENED AND I WAS CERTAIN THAT IF THE INTENSITY OF THE FRIGORIFIC RADIATIONS OF THE COLD DISK SHOULD NOT BE INCREASED IN EXACTLY THE SAME DEGREE THE BALL OF THE THERMOSCOPE EXPOSED TO THE SIMUL TANEOUS ACTIONS OF THESE TWO DISKS COULD NOT POSSIBLY REMAIN AT THE SAME CONSTANT TEMPERATURE THAT OF 72 THE RESULT OF THE EXPERIMENT WAS VERY DECISIVEE THE BUBBLE OF SPIRIT OF WINE REMAINED AT REST WHICH PROVED THAT THE IN TENSITIES OF THE RAYS EMITTED BY THE TWO DISKS STILL CONTINUED TO BE EQUAL AT THE SURFACE OF THE BALL OF THE THERMOSCOPE WHICH AT EQUAL DISTANCES WAS EXPOSED TO THEIR SIMULTANEOUS ACTION HENCE WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH ARE FAVOURABLE TO THE COPIOUS EMISSION OF CALORIFIC RAYS FROM THE SURFACES OF HOT BODIES ARE EQUALLY FAVOURABLE TO A COPIOUS ENMIIS SION OF FRIGORIFIC RAYS FROM SIMILAR BODIES WHEN THEY ARE COLD BUT IT IS TIME TO CONSIDER THESE EMANATIONS IN A NEW POINT OF VIEW WHAT DIFFERENCE CAN THERE BE BETWEEN CALORIFIC RAYS AND FRIGORIFIC RAYS  ARE NOT THE SAME RAYS EITHER CALORIFIC OR FRI GORIFIC ACCORDING AS THE BODY AT WHOSE SURFACE THEY ARRIVE IS HOTTER OR COLDER THAN THAT FROM WHICH THEY PROCEED LET US SUPPOSE THREE

PLAINED BUT WITHOUT STOPPING TO FORM ANY HYPOTHESIS FOR THE EXPLANATION OF THESE APPEARANCES I SHALL PROCEED IN MY ACCOUNT OF THE VARIOUS ATTEMPTS I HAVE MADE TO ELUCIDATE BY NEW EXPE RIMENTS THOSE PARTS OF THIS INTERESTING SUBJECT WHICH STILL AP PEARED TO BE ENVELOPED IN OBSCURITY AS THE COOLING OF HOT BODIES IS SO MUCH ACCELERATED BY COVERING THEIR SURFACES WITH SUCH SUBSTANCES AS EMIT CALORIFIC RAYS IN GREAT ABUNDANCE OR WITH SUCH AS ARE MUCH AFFECTED BY THE FRIGORIFIC RAYS OF THE COLDER BODIES BY WHICH THEY ARE SURROUNDED IT SEEMS TO BE HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT A COMPARATIVELY SMALL PART OF THE HEAT WHICH A BODY SO COOLED ACTUALLY LOSES IS ACQUIRED BY THE AIR A MUCH GREATER PROPORTION OF IT PASSING OFF THROUGH THAT TRANSPARENT FLUID UNDER THE FORM OF CALORIFIC RAYS WITHOUT AF FECTING ITS TEMPERATURE IF THIS SUPPOSITION SHOULD TURN OUT TO BE WELL FOUNDED THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE FACT WOULD ENABLE US TO EXPLAIN SEVERAL INTER RESTING PHENOMENA AND PARTICULARLY THAT MOST CURIOUS PROCESS BY MEANS OF WHICH LIVING ANIMALS PRESERVE AN EQUAL TEMPERATURE NOTWITHSTANDING THE VAST QUANTITIES OF HEAT THAT ARE CONTINUALLY GENERATED IN THE LUNGS AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE GREAT VARIATIONS WHICH TAKE PLACE IN THE TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR IN WHICH THEY LIVE IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE GREATER THE POWER IS WHICH AN ANIMAL POSSESSES OF THROWING OFF HEAT FROM THE SURFACE OF HIS BODY INDE PENDENTLY OF THAT WHICH THE SURROUNDING AIR TAKES OFF THE LESS WILL HIS TEMPERATURE BE AFFECTED BY THE OCCASIONAL CHANGES OF DMCCCIV S13O COUNT RUMFORDS ENQUIRY CONCERNING THE NATURE OF HEAT TEMPERATURE WHICH TAKE PLACE IN THE AIR AND THE LESS WILL HE BE OPPRESSED BY THE INTENSE HEATS OF HOT CLIMATES IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT NEGROES AND PEOPLE OF COLOUR SUPNORT THE HEATS OF TROPICAL CLIMATES MUCH BETTER THAN WHITE PEOPLE IS IT NOT PROBABLE THAT THEIR COLOUR MAY ENABLE THEM TO THROW OFF CALORIFIC RAYS WITH GREAT FACILITY AND IN GREAT ABUNDANCE AND THAT IT IS TO THIS CIRCUMSTANCE THEY OWE THE ADVANTAGE THEY POSSESS OVER WHITE PEOPLE IN SUPPORTING HEAT AND EVEN SHOULD IT BE TRUE THAT BODIES ARE COOLED NOT IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE RAYS THEY EMIT BUT BY THE ACTION OF THOSE FRIGORIFIC RAYS THEY RECEIVE FROM OTHER COLDER BODIES WHICH I MUCH SUSPECT TO BE THE CASE YET AS IT HAS BEEN FOUND BY EXPERIMENT THAT THOSE BODIES WHICH EMIT CALORIFIC RAYS IN THE GREATEST ABUNDANCE ARE ALSO MOST AFFECTED BY THE FRIGORIFIC RAYS OF COLDER BODIES IT IS EVIDENT THAT IN A VERY HOT COUNTRY WHERE THE AIR AND ALL OTHER SURROUNDING BODIES ARE BUT VERY LITTLE COLDER THAN THE SURFACE OF THE SKIN THOSE WHO BY THEIR COLOUR ARE PREPARED AND DISPOSED TO BE COOLED WITHTHE GREATEST FACILITY WILL BE THE LEAST LIKELY TO BE OPPRESSED BY THE ACCUMULATION OF THE HEAT GENERATED IN THEM BY RESPIRATION OR OF THAT EXCITED BY

WAS DESIROUS BY VARYING MY EXPERIMENTS TO BRING IF POSSIBLE A VARIETY OF PROOFS TO SUPPORT THE IMPORTANT CONCLUSIONS WHICH RESULT FROM IT EXPER NO 28 HAVING COVERED THE TWO LARGE CYLINDRICAL VESSELS NO 3 AND NO 4 WITH GOLDBEATERS SKIN I PAINTED ONE OF THEM BLACK WITH INDIAN INK AND FILLING THEM BOTH WITH BOILING HOT WATER I EXPOSED THEM TO COOL IN THE MANNER ALREADY OFTEN DESCRIBED IN THE AIR OF A QUIET ROOM NO 4 WHICH WAS BLACKENED COOLED THROUGH THE STANDARD IN TERVAL OF LO DEGREES IN A3 MINUTES  WHILE THE OTHER NO A WHICH WAS NOT BLACKENED TOOK UP 28 MINUTES IN COOLING THROUGH THE SAME INTERVAL IN A FORINER EXPERIMENT NO 2E THE INSTRUMENT NO 4 COVERED WVITH GOLDBEATERS SKIN BUT NOT BLACKENED HAD TAKEN UP 27I MINUTES IN COOLING THROUGH THE GIV7N INTERVAL AS WE HAVE BEFORE SEEN THE RESULTS OF THESE EXPERIMENTS DO NOT STAND IN NEED OF ILLUS TRATION AND I SHALL LEAVE TO PHYSICIANS AND PHYSIOLOG ISTS TO DETERS MNINE WHAT ADVANTAGES MAY BE DERIVED FROM A KNOWLEDGE OF THE S232 COUNT RUMFORDS ENQUIRY CONCERNING THE NATURE OF HEA FACTS THEY ESTABLISH IN TAKING MEASURES FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE HEALTH OF EUROPEANS WHO QUIT THEIR NATIVE CLIMATE TO INHABIT HOT COUNTRIES ALL I WILL VENTURE TO SAY ON THE SUBJECT IS THAT WERE I CALLED TO INHABIT A VERY HOT COUNTRY NOTHING SHOULD PREVENT ME FROM MAKING THE EXPERIM NT OF BLACKENING MY SKIN OR AT LEAST OF WEARING A BLACK SHIRT IN THE SHADE AND ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT IN ORDER TO FIND OUT IF BY THOSE MEANS I COULD NOT CONTRIVE TO MAKE MYSELF MORE COMFORTABLE SEVERAL OF THE SAVAGE TRIBES WHICH INHABIT VERY COLD COUNTRIES BESMEAR THEIR SKINS WITH O1 WHICH GIVES THEM A SHINING APE PEARANCE THE RAYS OF LIGHT ARE REFLECTED COPIOUSLY FIOM THE SURFACE OF THEIR BODIES MAY NOT THE FRIGORIFIC RAYS WHICH ARRIVE AT THE SURFACE OF THEIR SKIN BE ALSO REFLECTED BY THE HIGHLY POX LISHED SURFACE OF THE OIL WITH WHICH IT IS COVERED IF THAT SHOULD BE THE CASE INSTEAD OF DESPISING THESE POOR CREAM TURES FOR THEIR ATTACHMENT TO A USELESS AND LOATHSOME HABIT WE SHOULD BE DISPOSED TO ADMIRE THEIR INGENUITY OR RATHER TO ADMIRE AND ADORE THE GOODNESS OF THEIR INVISIBLE GUARDIAN AND INSTRUCTOR WVHO TEACHES THEM TO LIKE AND TO PRACTICE WHAT HE KNOWS TO BE USEFUL TO THEM THE 1 O TENTOTS BESMEAR THEMSELVES AND COVER THEIR BODIES IN A MANNER STILL MORE DISGUSTING THEY THINK THEMSELVES FNE WHEN THEY ARE BESMEARED AND DRESSED OUT ACCORDING TO THE LOATHSOME CUSTOM OF THEIR COUNTRY BUT WHO KNOWS WHETHER THEY MAY NOT IN FACT BE MORE COMFORTABLE AND BETTER ABLE TO SUPPORT THE EXCESSIVE HEATS TO WHICH THEY ARE EXPOSED  FROM SEVERAL EXPERIMENTS WHICH I MADE WITH A VIEW TO ELUCIDATE THAT POINT OF WHICH AN ACCOUNT WILL BE GIVEN TO THIS SOCIETY AT SOME FUTURE PERIOD I HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO CONCLUDE THAT THE HOTTENTOTSAND TLHE MODE OF ITS COMMUNICATION 1A3 DERIVE ADVANTAGES FROM THAT PRACTICE EXACTLY SIMILAR TO THOSE WHICH NEGROES DERIVE FROM THEIR BLACK COLOUR IT CANNOT SURELY BE SUPPOSED THAT I COULD EVER THINK OF RE COMMENDING SERIOUSLY TO POLISHED NATIONS THE FILTHY PRACTICES OF THESE SAVAGES THAT IS VERY FAR INDEED FROM BEING MY INTEND TION FOR I HAVE EVER CONSIDERED CLEANLINESS AS BEING SO INDIS PENSABLY NECESSARY TO COMFORT AND HAPPINESS THAT WE CAN HAVE NO REAL ENJOYMENT WITHOUT IT BUT STILL I THINK THAT A KNOWLEDGE OF THE PHYSICAL ADVANTAGES WHICH THOSE SAVAGES DERIVE FROM SUCH PRACTICES MAY ENABLE US TO ACQUIRE THE SAME ADVANTAGES BY EMPLOYING MORE ELEGANT MEANS A KNOWLEDGE OF THE MANNER N WHICH HEAT AND COLD ARE EXCITED WOULD ENABLE UTS TO TAKE MNEASURES FOR THESE IMPORTANT PURPOSES WITH PERFECT CERTAINTY IN THE MEAN TIMES WE MAY DERIVE MUCH USEFUL INFORMATION BY A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE PHENOMENA WHICH OCCASIONALLY FALL UNDER OUR OBSERVATION IF IT BE TRUE THAT THE BLACK COLOUR OF A NEGRO BY RENDERING HIM MORE SENSIBLE TO THE FEW FRIGORIFIC RAYS WHICH ARE TO BE FOUND IN A VERY HOT COUNTRY ENABLES HIM TO SUPPORT THE GREAT HEATS OF TROPICAL CLIMATES WITHOUT INCONVENIENCE IT MIGHT BE ASKED HOW IT HAPPENS THAT HE IS ABLE TO SUPPORT NAKED THE DIRECT RAYS OF A BURNING SUN  THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN NEGROES EXPOSED NAKED TO THE SUNS RAYS IN HOT COUNTRIES MUST HAVE OBSERVED THAT THEIR SKINS IN THAT SITUATION ARE ALWAYS VERY SHINING AN OIL EXUDES FROM THEIR SKIN WHICH GIVES IT THAT SHINING APPEARANCE AND THE POLISHED SURFACE OF THAT OIL REFLECTS THE SUNS CALORIFIC RAYS IF THE HEAT BE VERY INTENSE SWEAT MAKES ITS APPEARANCE AT THE SURFACE OF THE SKIN THIS WATERY FLUID NOT ONLY REFLECTS VERY13I COUNT RUMFORDS ENQUIRY CONCERNING THE NATURE OF HEAT POWERFULLY THE CALORIFIC RAYS FROM THE

LEFT IDI A STATE VERY FAVOURABLE TO THE ADMISSION OF THOSE FEEBLE FRIGORIFIC RAYS WHICH ARRIVE FROM THE NEIGHBOURING OBJECTS BUT I SHALL REFRAIN FROM PURSUING THESE SPECULATIONS ANY FARTHER AT PRESENT I SHALL NOW PROCEED TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF SEVERAL EXPERIMENTS OF VARIOUS KINDS WHICH WERE MADE WITH A VIEW TO A FARTHER IN VESTIGATION OF THE RADIATIONS OF COLD BODIES HAVING FOUND BY SEVERAL OF THE FOREGOING EXPERIMENTS THAT THE RADIATIONS OF COLD BODIES AFFECTED MY THERMOSCOPE VERY SEN SIBLY EVEN WHEN PLACED AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM IT AND IN SITUATIONS WHERE CURRENTS OF COLD AIR COULD NOT BE SUSPECTED TO EXIST I WAS DESIROUS OF FINDING OUT WHETHER THE COOLING OF A HOT BODY WOULD OR WOULD NOT BE SENSIBLY ACCELERATED BY THOSE RAYS TO DETERMINE THAT POINT I MADE THE FOLLOWING EXPE RIMENT EXPER NO 2J HAVING PROVIDED TWO CONICAL VESSELS MADE OF THIN SHEET BRASS EACH 4 INCHES IN DIAMETER AT THE BASE AND 4 INCHES HIGH ENDING ABOVE IN A CYLINDRICAL NECK O88 OF AN INCH IN DIAMETER I ENCLOSED EACH OF THEM IN A CYLINDER OF THIN PASTEBOARD COVERED WITH GILT PAPER AND THEN COVERED THEM UP WITH RABBITSKINS WHICH HAD THE HAIR ON THEM IN SUCH A MANNER THAT NO PART OF THESE VESSELS EXCEPT THEIR FLAT BOTTOMSWAS EXPOSED NAKED TO THE AIR I THEN COVERED THEIR BOTTOMS WITH GOLDBEATERS SKIN PAINTED BLACK WITH INDIAN INK IN ORDER TO RENDER THEM AS SENSIBLE AS POSSIBLE TO CALORIFIC AND FRIGORIFIC RAYSAND THE MODE OF ITS COMMUNICATION 13 THIS BEING DONE I SUSPENDED THESE TWO VESSELS IN AN ERECT POSITION OR WITH THEIR BOTTOMS DOWNWARDS TO THE TWO OPPOSITE HORIZONTAL ARMS OF A WOODEN STAND PROVIDED FOR THE EXPERIMENT AND I PLACED UNDER EACH OF THEM A PEWTER PLATTER BLACKENED ON THE INSIDE BY HOLDING IT OVER A LIGHTED WAX CANDLE EACH OF THESE PLATTERS WAS I2 INCHES IN DIAMETER AND THEY WERE SUPPORTED ON THE TOP OF TWO SHALLOW EARTHEN DISHES EACH OF WHICH WAS I IL INCHES IN DIAMETER AT ITS BRIM THESE EARTHEN DISHES BEING SUPPORTED ON CIRCULAR VOODEN STANDS LO INCHES IN DIAMETER A CIRCULAR PIECE OF THICK DRAWINGPAPER 12J INCHES IN DIA METER WITH A CIRCULAR HOLE IN ITS CENTRE JIUST 6 INCHES IN DIAMETER WAS PLACED ON EACH OF THE PLATTERS AND SERVED AS A PERFORATED COVER TO IT THE STANDS ON WHICH THE PLATTERS WERE SUPPORTED WERE OF SUCH A HEIGHT THAT THE UPPER SURFACE OF THE FLAT BOTTOM OF EACH OF THE PLATTERS WAS ELEVATED JUST 40 INCHES ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE FLOOR OF THE ROOM AND THE HORIZONTAL ARMS OF THE WOODEN STAND WHICH SUPPORTED THE CONICAL VESSELS WAS OF SUCH A HEIGHT THAT THE FLAT BOTTOMS OF THESE VESSELS WHICH WERE PLACED PER PENDICULARLY OVER THE CENTRES OF THE PLATTERS WERE JUST 4 INCHES ABOVE THE FLAT HORIZONTAL SURFACE OF THE BOTTOMS OF THE PLATTERS ONE OF THE PLATTERS WAS AT THE TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR OF THE ROOM 63G F BUT THE OTHER WAS KEPT CONSTANTLY ICECOLD DURING THE WHOLE OF THE TIME THE EXPERIMENT LASTED BY MEANS OF POUNDED ICE AND WATER WHICH WAS PUT INTO THE EARTHEN CDISH OVER WHICH OR RATHER IN WHICH THIS PLATTER WAS PLACED EACH

BOTTOM THIS FLAT PART WAS ABOUT 8 INCHES IN DIAMETERE THE TWO CONICAL VESSELS WERE NOW FILLED WITH BOILING HOT WATER AND THE TIMES OF THEIR COOLING WERE CAREFULLY OBSERVED FROM THE ABOVE DESCRIPTION OF THE APPARATUS USED IN THIS EXPERIMENT IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE VESSEL WHICH WAS SUSPENDED OVER THE ICE COULD NOT BE REACHED BY ANY STREAMS OF COLD AIR THAT MIGHT BE OCCASIONED BY THAT ICE OR BY THE COOLED SIDES OF THE VESSEL WHICH CONTAINED IT FOR THE AIR WHICH COMING INTO CONTACT WITH THE SIDES OF THAT VESSEL WAS COOLED BY IT BECOMING SPECI FICALLY HEAVIER THAN IT WAS BEFORE NATURALLY DESCENDED AND SPREAD ITSELF OUT ON THE FLOOR OF THE ROOM AND THE PERFORATED CIRCULAR SHEET OF PAPER WHICH WAS LAID DOWN HORIZONTALLY ON THE PLATTER EFFECTUALLY PREVENTED ANY OF THE AIR SO COOLED FROM BEING

PLACED IN THE CONICAL VESSELS IN ORDER TO GUARD STILL MORE EFFECTUALLY THE BOTTOMS OF THE VESSELS WHICH WERE COOLING FROM THE EFFECTS OF OCCASIONAL UNDU LATIONS IN THE AIR OF THE ROOM OVER EACH OF THESE VESSELS THERE WAS DRAWN A CYLINDRICAL COVERING OF VERY FINE THIN POST PAPER THE LOWER OPEN END OF WHICH PROJECTED JUST HALF AN INCH BELOW THE HORIZONTAL LEVEL OF THE FLAT BOTTOMN OF THE VESSEL

OUTSIDE OF EACH CONICAL VESSEL AND ITS CYLINDRICAL NECK AND THE INSIDE OF THE HOLLOW CYLINDER OF PASTEBOARD IN THE AXIS OF WHICH IT WAS FIXED AND CONFINED THE RESULT OF THIS EXPERIMENT WAS VERY

TIME OF THE SOCIETY BY GIVING A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THEM I MAY PERHAPS AT A FUTURE TIME FIND OCCASION TO MENTION SOLME OF THEM MORE PARTICULARLY IN THE TWO LASTMENTIONED EXPERIMENTS AS THE CONICAL VESSELS WERE SUSPENDED IN AN ERECT POSITIOR AND HAD A CIRC LAR BAND OR HOOP OF FINE POST PAPER BY WHLICH TH LOWER END OF EACH OF THEIN WAS SURROUNDED AND WHICH PROJECTED DOWNWARDS HALF AN INCH BELOW

DOUBT BUT THAT THE TIME OF COOLING WAS PROLONGED BY THIS ARRANGEMENT FOR THERE BEING MUCH REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE PROPAGATION OF HEAT DOWNWARDS IN AIR FROM ONE PARTICLE OF THAT FLUID TO ANOTHER IS EITHER QUITE IMPOSSIBLE OR SO EXTREMELY SLOW AS TO BE IMPER CEPTIBLE AS A SUCCESSION OF FRESH PARTICLES OF COLD AIR WAS PRE VENTED FROM COMING INTO CONTACT WITH THE BOTTOMS OF THE VESSELS BUT VERY

MIGHT REASONABLY BE EXPECTED THAT AS MUCH HEAT AS POSSIBLE WOULD BE COMMUNICATED IMMEDIATELY TO THE AIR BY THE HOT BODY AND THAT THE HEAT SO COMMUNICATED WOULD OF COURSE ACCELERATE THE COOLING OF THAT VESSEL IT WAS IN FACT COOLED IN A SHORTER TIME THAN THE OTHER NO  WHICH WAS SUSPENDED IN A VERTICAL POSITION BUT THE DIFFERENCE OF THE TIMES OF COOLING WAS VERY SMALL WHICH INDICATES IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN THAT A COMPARATIVELY SMALL QUANTITY OF THE HEAT A HOT BODY LOSES WVHEN IT IS COOLED IN AIR IS COMMUNICATED TO THAT FLUID MUCH THE GREATER PART OF IT BEING SENT OFF THROUGH THE AIR TO A DISTANCE IN CALORIFIC RAYS THE VESSEL NO I WAS FOUND TO COOL THROUGH THE STANDARD INS TERVAL OF IO DEGREES IN 381 MINUTES AND NO 6 WHICH WAS IN A RECLINED POSITION IN 3 MINUTES IT WILL NO DOUBT BE REMARKED THAT THE VESSEL NO 5 COOLED SOMEWHAT FASTER IN THIS EXPERIMENT THAN IT HAD DONE IN THE TWO PRECEDING EXPERIMENTS NO 29 AND NO O LWHEN IT STOOD OVER A PEWTER PLATTER WHICH AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EXPERIMENT AT LEAST WAS AT THE SAME TEMPERATURE AS THE AIR OF THE ROOM THE CALORIFIC RAYS FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE VESSEL HEATING THE PLATTER IN SOME SMALL DEGREE AND STILL MORE PERHAPS THE UPPER

WHETHER THE COOLING OF A HOT BODY IN AIR IS OR IS NOT SENSIBLY ACCELERATED OR RETARDED BY THE GREATER OR LESSER DISTANCE AT WHICH THE BODY IS PLACED FROM OTHER NEIH BOURING SOLID BODIES WHEN THESE

COOLING OF THE CONICAL VESSEL IN THE PRECEDING EXPERIMENTS HAD IN FACT BEEN RETARDED BY THE VICINITY OF THE PEWTER PLATTER OVER WHICH IT WAS SUSPENDED I WAS NOW INDUCED TO REPEAT THESE EXPERIMENTS

IF THE HOT BODY INSTEAD OF BEING A CONICAL VESSEL COVERED UP ON ALL SIDES EXCEPT ITS FLAT BOTTOM HAD BEEN A GLOBE AND IF THIS HOT GLOBE HAD BEEN SUSPENDED IN THE CENTRE OF ANOTHER LARGER THIN HOLLOW SPHERE THIS LAST BEING AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EXPERIMENT AT THE SAME TEMPERATURE AS THE AIR AND WALLS OF THE ROOM THE VICINITY OF THE SURFACE OF THIS HOLLOW GLOBE TO THE SURFACE OF THE HOT BODY WOULD HAVE RETARDED THE COOLING OF THE HOT BODY IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE COOLING OF THE CONICAL VESSEL NO KI WAS RETARDED IN THE FOREGOING EXPERIMENTS AND IF INSTEAD OF INCLOSING THE HOT BODY IN THE CENTRE OF A SINGLE HOLLOW SPHERE OF ANY GIVEN THICKNESS IT WERE PLACED IN THE COMMON CENTRE OF A NUMBER OF MUCH THINNER CONCENTRIC SPHERES OF DIF FERENT DIAMETERS THE TIME OF COOLING WOULD BE STILL MORE RETARDED BY TRACING THE VARIOUS OPERATIONS WHICH WOULD TAKE PLACE IN THE COOLING OF THE HOT BODY IN THIS IMAGINARY EXPERIMENT WE SHALL BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH THE NATURE OF THOSE WHICH ACTUALLY TAKE PLACE WHEN THE COOLING OF A HOT BODY IS PROLONGED BY MEANS OF WARM CLOTHING FROM THE RESULTS OF SEVERAL OF THE FOREGOING EXPERIMENTS WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT SUPPOSING THE THIN CONCENTRIC HOLLOW SPHERES IN WHICH THE HOT BODY IS CONFINED TO BE MADE OF METAL THE COOLING WILL BE SLOWER IF THE SURFACES OF THESE SPHERES ARE POW LISHED THAN IF THEY ARE UNPOLISHED OR BLACKENED  AND HENCE WE MIGHT VERY

BEING COOLED BY THE INFLUENCE FRIGORIFIC RADIATIONS OF SURROUNDING COLDER BODIES DEPENDS VERY MUCH ON THE POLISH OF ITS SURFACE IF WXITH THE ASSISTANCE OF A MICROSCOPE WE EXAMINE THOSE SUBSTANCES WHICH SUPPLY US WITH THE WARMEST COVERINLGS SUCH FOR INSTANCE AS FURS FEATHERS SILK C WE SHALL FIND THEIR SUR FACES NOT ONLY SMOOTH BUT ALSO VERY HIGHLY POLISHED  WE SHALL ALSO FIND THAT OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES BEING EQUAL THOSE SUBSTANCES ARE THE WARMEST WHICH ARE THE FINEST OR WHICH ARE COMPOSED OF THE GREATEST NUMBER OF FINE POLISHED DETACHED THREADS OR FIBRES THE FINE WHITE SHINING FUR OF A RUSSIAN HARE IS MUCH WARMER THAN COARSE HAIR AND FINE SILK AS SPUN BY THE SILKWORM IS WARMER THAN THE SAME SILK TWISTED TOGETHER INTO COARSE THREADS  AS I FOUND BY ACTUAL EXPERIMENTS AN ACCOUNT OF WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN LAID BEFORE THIS SOCIETY AND PUBLISHED IN THE PHI LOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS I1 FORMERLY CONSIDERED THE WARMTH OF NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL CLOTHING AS DEPENDING PRINCZPALLY ON THE OBSTACLE IT OPPOSES TO THE MOTIONS OF THE COLD AIR BY WHICH THE HOT BODY IS SURROUNDED BUT BY A PATIENT AND CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE SUBJECT I HAVE BEEN CONVINCED THAT THE EFFICACY OF RADIATION IS MUCH GREATER THAN I HAD SUPPOSED IT TO BE FROM THE RESULT OF THE EXPERIMENT NO 31 1WE MIGHT BE LED TO CONCLUDE THAT A VERY SMALL PART ONLY OF THE HEAT WHICH A HOT BODY APPEARS TO LOSE WHEN IT IS COOLED IN AIR IS IN FACT COMMU NICATED TO THAT FLUID A MUCH GREATER PORTION OF IT BEING COM MUNICATED TO OTHER SURROUNDILN BODIES AT A DISTANCE AND II ONE OF MY FORMER EXPERIMENTS A HOT BODY WAS COOLED THOUGH IT WAS PLACED IN A RRICELLAN VACUUM150 COUNT RUMFORDS ENQUIRY CONCERNING THE NATURE OF HEAT THESE RESEARCHES APPEAR TO ME TO BE THE MORE INTERESTING AS I HAVE LONG BEEN OF OPINION THAT IT MUST BE BY EXPERIMENTS OF THIS KIND SHOWING IN WHAT MANNER THE TEMPERATURE OF BODIES ARE AFFECTED RECIPROCALLY AT DIFFERENT DEGREES OF TEMPERATURE AND AT DIFFERENT DISTANCES THAT THE HYPOTHESIS OF RADIATION MUST BE ESTABLISHED OR PROVED TO BE UNFOUNDED WHEN I SPEAK OF HEAT AS BEING COMMUNICATED TO AIR IMME DIATELY BY A HOT BODY WHICH IS COOLED IN IT I MEAN ONLY THAT IT IS NOT FIRST COMMUNICATED TO OTHER NEIGHBOURING BODIES AND THEN GIVEN BY THEM TO THE PARTICLES OF AIR WITH WHICH THEY HAPPEN TO BE IN CONTACT IN THIS LAST MENTIONED WAY MUCH OF THE HEAT NO DOUBT WHICH A HOT BODY LOSES WHEN COOLED IN AIR IS ULTIMATELY COMMUNICATED TO THAT FLUID I AM FAR FROM SUPPOSING THAT THE PARTICLES OF AIR WHICH COMING INTO CONTACT WITH A HOT BODY ARE HEATED IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT NEAR APPROXIMATION RECEIVE HEAT IN ANY OTHER MANNER THAN THAT IN WHICH OTHER BODIES AT A GREATER DISTANCE RECEIVE IT IF IN THE ONE CASE IT BE GENERATED OR EXCITED BY THE AGENCY OF CALORIFIC RAYS OR UNDULATIONS CAUSED BY THE HOT BODY IT MUST I AM PERSUADED BE EXCITED IN THE SAME MANNER IN THE OTHER THE REASON WHY THE PARTICLE OF AIR WHICH IS IN IMMEDIATE CONTACT WITH A HOT BODY IS HEATED WHILE OTHER PARTICLES NEAR IT ARE NOT AFFECTED BY THE CALORIFIC RAYS FROM THE HOT BODY WHICH ARE CONTINUALLY PASSING BY THEM THROUGH THE AIR IS I CONCEIVE BECAUSE THE PARTICLE HEATED IS AT THE SURFACE OF THE FLUID AIR WHERE THESE RAYS ARE EITHER REFLECTED REFRACTED OR ABSORBED BUT WHEN A RAY HAS ONCE PASSED THE SURFACE OF A TRANSPARENT FLUID IT PROCEEDS STRAIGHT FORWARDS WITHOUT BEING FARTHER AFFECTED BY IT AND CONSEQUENTLY WITHOUT AFFECTING IT TILL IT COMES TO THE CONFINES OF THE MEDIUM OR TO THE SURFACE OF SOME OTHER BODYAND THE MODE OF ITS COMMUNICATION 151 IF THIS HYPOTHESIS OF THE COMMUNICATION OR RATHER GENERATION OF HEAT AND OF COLD BY RADIATION BE TRUE IT WVILL ENABLE US TO EXPLAIN IN A SATISFACTORY MANNER WHAT HAS BEEN CALLED THE NON CONDUCTING POWER OF TRANSPARENT FLUIDS WITH RESPECT TO HEAT FOR IF HEAT BE REALLY COMMUNICATED OR EXCITED IN THE MANNER ABOVE DESCRIBED IT IS QUITE EVIDENT THAT A PERFECTLY TRANSPARENT LUID CAN RECEIVE HEAT ONLY AT ITS SURFACE AND CONSEQUENTLY THAT HEAT CANNOT BE PROPAGATED IN SUCH A FLUID BY COMMUNICATION FROM ONE PARTICLE OF THE FLUID TO ANOTHER BY A TRANSPARENT FLUID I MEAN SUCH AN ONE AS ADMITS THE CA LORIFIC AND FRIGORIFIC RAYS EMITTED BY HOT AND BY COLD BODIES TO PASS FREELY THROUGH IT WITHOUT OBSTRUCTING THEIR PASSAGE OR DI MINISHING THEIR INTENSITIES WHETHER ANY OF THE FLUIDS WITH WHICH WE ARE ACQUAINTED BE PERFECTLY TRANSPARENT IN THIS SENSE OF THE WORD OR NOT I WILL NOT PRETEND TO SAY BUT THERE IS REASON TO THINK THAT PURE WATER AND AIR AND MOST OTHER FLUIDS WHICH ARE TRANSPARENT TO LIGHT POSSESS A HIGH DEGREE OF TRANSPARENCY IN REGARD TO CALORIFIC AND FRIGORIFIC RAYS OR THAT THEY GIVE A VERY FREE PASSAGE TO THEM WHEN THEY HAVE ONCE PASSED THEIR SURFACES AN EVEN OR POLISHED SURFACE HAS BEEN FOUND TO FACILITATE VERY MUCH THE REFLECTION OF THE RAYS OF LIGHT MAY IT NOT IN ALL CASES HAVE AN EQUAL TENDENCY TO FACILITATE THE REFLECTION OF CALORIFIC AND FRIGORIFIC RAYS  IN THE EXPERIMENTS WITH THE LARGE CYLINDRICAL VESSELS WHERE THEY WERE EXPOSED NAKED TO COOL IN THE AIR THEIR SURFACES WERE POLISHED AND THEY WERE A LONG TIME IN COOLING BUT WHEN THE SURFACE OF THE VESSEL WAS BLACKENED OR COVERED WITH OTHER SUB STANCES THE VESSEL WAS FOUND TO COOL MUCH MORE RAPIDLY A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE FRIGORIFIC RAYS FROM THE SURROUNDINGALE COUNT RUMFORDS ENQUIRY CONCERNING THE NATURE OF HEAT COLDER BODIES WERE IN THE FORMER CASE REFLECTED AT THE POLISHED SURFACE OF THE METALLIC VESSEL BUT IN THE LATTER CASE MORE OF THEM WERE ABSORBED WHEN A LARGE DROP OF WATER ROLLS ABOUT WITHOUT BEING EVA PORATED UPON THE FLAT SURFACE OF A PIECE OF REDHOT IRON THE SURFACE OF THE DROP IS POLISHED AND THE CALORIFIC RAYS BEING MOSTLY REFLECTED THE WATER IS VERY LITTLE HEATED NOTWITHSTANDING THE EXTREME INTENSITY OF THE HEAT OF THE IRON AND ITS NEARNESS TO THE WATER IF THE IRON BE LESS HOT THE WATER PENETRATES THE PORES OF THE OXIDE WHICH COVERS THE METALTHE DROP CEASES TO HAVE A PO LISHED SURFACEACQUIRES HEAT VERY RAPIDLYAND IS SOON EVA PORATED IF A DROP OF WATER BE PLACED ON THE CLEAN AND POLISHED SURFACE OF A METAL NOT SO EASILY OXIDABLE AS IRON IT WILL RETAIN ITS SPHE RICAL FORM AND POLISHED SURFACE UNDER A LOWER DEGREE OF TEM PERATURE THAN ON IRON AND CONSEQUENTLY WILL BE LESS HEATED AND LESS RAPIDLY EVAPORATED BY A MODERATE HEAT IF A LARGE DROP OF WATER BE PUT CAREFULLY INTO A CLEAN SILVER SPOON PREVIOUSLY HEATED VERY HOT THAT IS TO SAY SO HOT AS TO GIVE A LOUD HISSING NOISE WHEN TOUCHED WITH THE WETTED FINGER BUT MUCH BELOW THE HEAT OF REDHOT METAL THE DROP WILL SUP PORT OR RATHER RESIST THIS HEAT FOR A CONSIDERABLE TITIE BUT AFTER THE SPOON HAS BEEN SUFFERED TO COOL DOWNR NEARLY TO THE TEM PERATURE OF BOILING WATER A DROP OF WATER PUT INTO IT WILL BE EVAPORATED INSTANTANEOUSLY IT APPEARS FROM THE RESULTS OF THESE EXPERIMENTS TO BE PRO BABLE THAT UNDER HIGH TEMPERATURES AIR IS ATTRACTED BY METALS SO MUCH MORE STRONGLY THAN WATER THAT EVEN THE WEIGHT OF A DROP OF WATER IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO FORCE AWAY THE STRATUM OF AIRAND THE MODE OF ITS COINUZNICATZON2XA WHICH COVERS AND ADHERES TO THE SURFACE OF A METAL ON WHICH THE DROP REPOSES BUT AT LOWER TEMPERATURES THIS DOES NOT SEEM TO BE THE CASE THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENT WHICH I MADE SEVERAL MONTHS AGO WITH A VIEW TO INVESTIGATE THE CAUSE OF THE SLOW EVAPORATION OF DROPS OF WATER PLACED ON HOT METALS WILL I THINK THROW MUCH LIGHT ON THIS SUBJECT EXPER NO 34 TAKING A CLEAN POLISHED SILVER SPOON I BLACKENED THE INSIDE OF IT BY HOLDING IT OVER THE FLAME OF A WAX CANDLE THEN PUTTING A LARGE DROP OF WATER INTO IT I FOUND AS I EXPECTED THAT THE DROP TOOK A SPHERICAL FORM AND ROLLED ABOUT IN THE SPOON WITHOUT WETTING ITS BLACKENED SURFACE I NOW HELD THE SPOON OVER THE FLAME OF A CANDLE AND ATTEMPTED TO MAKE THE WATER BOIL BUT I FOUND IT TO BE ABSOLUTELY IMPOS SIBLE THE HANDLE OF THE SPOON BECAME SO VERY HOT THAT I COULD NOT HOLD IT IN MY HAND WITHOUT BEING BURNT THOUGH IT WAS WRAPPED UP IN THREE OR FOUR THICKNESSES OF LINEN BUT STILL THE DROP OF WATER DID NOT APPEAR TO BE AT ALL AFFICTED BY THIS INTENSE HEAT IF THE BOWL OF THE SPOON WERE TOUCHED WITH THE FINGER A HISSING NOISE ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS EXTREMELY HOT BUT STILL THE WATER REMAINED PERFECTLY QUIET IN THE SPOON WITHOUT BEING EVAPORATED HAVING IN VAIN ATTEMPTED TO MAKE THIS DROP OF WATER BOIL AND NOT BEING ABLE TO HOLD THE SPOON OVER THE FLAME OF THE CANDLE ANY LONGER ON ACCOUNT OF THE HEAT OF ITS HANDLE I NOW POURED THE DROP INTO THE PALM OF MY HAND I FOUND IT TO BE WARM BUT BY NO MEANS SCALDING HOT BY HOLDING THE SPOON WITH A PAIR OF TONGS OVER THE FLAME OF THE CANDLE FOR A LONGER TIME I FOUND THAT A DROP OF WATER IN MDCCCILV X151 COUNT RUMFORDS ENQUIRY CONCERNING THE NATURE OF H1EAT1I THE SPOON GRADUALLY CHANGED ITS FORM BECAME LESS AND WAS AT LENGTH EVAPORATED FROM BEING SPHERICAL AND LUCID IT GRADUALLY TOOK AN OBLONG FORM AND ITS SURFACE BECAME OBSCURE AND WHEN IT WAS EVAPORATED IT LEFT A KIND OF SKIN BEHIND IT WHICH WAS EVIDENTLY COMPOSED OF THE PARTICLES OF BLACK MATTER WHICH HAD BY DEGREES ATTACHED THEMSELVES TO ITS SURFACE AND WHICH PRO BABLY HAD CONTRIBUTED NOT A LITTLE TO ITS BEING AT LAST HEATED AND EVAPORATED THE CHANGE IN THE CORM OF THE DROP OF WATER AND MORE ESPECIALLY THE GRADUAL LOSS OF ITS LUCID APPEARANCE MADE ME SUSPECT THAT IT HAD TURNED ROUND DURING THE EXPERIMENT IF IT REALLY DID SO ITS MOTION MUST EITHER HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY RAPID OR VERY SLOW FOR THOUGH I EXAMINED IT WITH GREAT ATTENTION I COULD NOT PERCEIVE THAT IT HAD ANY ROTATORY MOTION I WILL TAKE THE LIBERTY TO MENTION ANOTHER LITTLE EXPERIMENT WHICH I HAVE OFTEN MADE TO AMUSE MYSELF AND OTHERS THOUGH IT MAY PERHAPS BE THOUGHT TOO TRIFLING TO DESERVE THE ATTENTION OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY EXPER NO 3 IF A LARGE DROP OF WATER BE FORMED AT THE END OF A SMALL SPLINTER OF LIGHT WOOD DEAL FOR INSTANCE AND THIS DROP BE THRUST QUICKLY INTO THE CENTRE OF THE FLAME OF A NEWLY SNUFFED CANDLE WHICH BURNS BRIGHT AND CLEAR THE DROP OF WATER WILL REMAIN FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME IN THE CENTRE OF THE FLAME AND SURROUNDED BY IT ON EVERY SIDE WITHOUT BEING MADE TO BOIL OR OTHERWISE APPARENTLY AFFECTED BY THE HEAT AND IF IT BE TAKEN OUT OF THE FLAME AND PUT UPON THE HAND IT WILL NOT BE FOUND TO BE SCALDING HOT IF IT BE HELD FOR SOME TIME IN THE FLAME IT WILL BE GREADUTALLY DIMINISHED BY EVAPORATION BUT THERE IS MUCH REASON TO THINKAND THE MODE OF ITS CORNMNI CDATION THAT THE HEAT WHICH IT ACQUIRES IS NOT COMMUNICATED TO IT BY THE FLAME BUT BY THE WOOD TO WHICH IT ADHERES WHICH IS SOON HEATED BY THE FLAME AND EVEN SET ON FIRE I CANNOT REFRAIN FROM JUST OBSERVING THAT IT APPEARS TO ME TO BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO RECONCILE THE RESULTS OF ANY OF THE FORES GOING EXPERIMENTS WITH THE HYPOTHESIS OF MODERN CHEMISTS REM SPECTING THE MATERIALITY OF HEAT DEEPLY SENSIBLE OF THE INSUFFICIENCY OF THE POWERS OF THE HUMAN MIND TO UNFOLD THE MYSTERIES OF NATURE AND DISCOVER THE AGENTS SHE EMPLOYS AND THEIR MODE OF ACTION IN HER SECRET AND INVISIBLE OPERATIONS AND BEING MOREOVER FULLY AWARE OF THE DANGER OF FORMING AN ATTACHMENT TO A FALSE THEORY AND OF THE FOLLY OF WASTING TIME IN IDLE SPECULATIONS I HAVE EVER IN MY PHI LOSOPHICAL RESEARCHES BEEN MUCH MORE ANXIOUS TO DISCOVER NEW FACTS AND TO SHOW HOW THE DISCOVERIES OF OTHERS MAY BE MADE USEFUL TO MANKIND THAN TO INVENT PLAUSIBLE THEORIES WHICH MUCH OFTENER TEND TO MISGUIDE THAN TO LEAD US IN THE PATH OF TRUTH A ND SCIENCE THERE ARE HOWEVER SITUATIONS IN WHICH AN EXPERIMENTAL ENLL QUIRER SOMETIMES FINDS HIMSELF WHERE IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO ABSTAIN FROM FORMING OR ADOPTING SOME GENERAL THEORY FOR THE PURPOSE OF EXPLAINING THE PHENOMENA WHICH FALL UNDER HIS OBSERVATION AND DIRECTING HIM IN HIS FUTURE RESEARCHES FINDING MYSELF IN THAT SITUATION AT THIS TIME I BEG THE ATTEND TION AND ABOVE ALL THE INDULGENCE OF THE SOCIETY WHILE I EN DEAVOUR TO EXPLAIN THE CONJECTURES I HAVE FORMED RESPECTING THE NATURE OF HEAT AND THE MODE OF ITS COMMUNICATION HOIT AND COLD LIKE FAST AND SLOW ARE MERE RELATIVE TERMS ANDO AS THERE IS NO RELATION OR PROPORTION BETWEEN MOTION AND A STATE OF REST SO THERE CAN BE NO RELATION BETWEEN ANY DEGREE156 COUNT RUMFORDS ENQUIRY CONCERNING THE NATURE OF HEAT OF HEAT AND ABSOLUTE COLD OR A TOTAL PRIVATION OF HEAT HENCE IT IS EVIDENT THAT ALL ATTEMPTS TO DETERMINE THE PLACE OF ABSOLUTE COLD ON THE SCALE OF A THERMOMETER MUST BE NUGATORY IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT MOTION IS AN ESSENTIAL QUALITY OF MATTER AND THAT REST IS NO WHERE TO BE FOUND IN THE UNIVERSE WE WELL KNOW THAT ALL THOSE BODIES WHICH FALL UNDER THE COGNIZANCE OF OUR SENSES ARE IN MOTION AND THERE ARE MANY APPEARANCES WHICH SEEM TO INDICATE THAT THE CONSTITUENT PARTICLES OF ALL BODIES ARE ALSO IMPRESSED WITH CONTINUAL MOTIONS AMONG THEMSELVES AND THAT IT IS THESE MOTIONS WHICH ARE CAPABLE OF AUGMENTATION AND DIMINUTION THAT CONSTITUTE THE HEAT OR TWNM PERATURE OF SENSIBLE BODIES THE ONLY EFFECTS OF WHICH WE HAVE ANY IDEA RESULTING FROM THE ACTION OF ONE BODY ON ANOTHER ARE A CHANGE OF VELOCITY OR A CHANGE OF DIRECTION OR BOTH WE PERCEIVE IT IS TRUE THAT CERTAIN BODIES HAVE A POWER OF AFFECTING CERTAIN OTHER BODIES AT A DISTANCE BUT THIS IS NO PROOF THAT THE EFFECTS PRODUCED ARE ES SENTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE WHICH RESULT FROM COLLISION FOR IF AN ELASTIC BODY BE INTERPOSED BETWEEN THE TWO BODIES THEIR ACTIONS ON EACH OTHER MAY BE COMMUNICATED THROUGH SUCH IN TERMEDIATE ELASTIC BODY WHICH WHEN THE ACTION IS AT AN END AND THE EFTICTS RESULTING FROM IT ON THE TWO BODIES HAVE TAKEN PLACE WILL BE IN THE SAME STATE PRECISELY IN WHICH IT WAS BEFORE THE ACTION BEGAN IF A BELL OR ANY OTHER SOLID BODY PERFECTLY ELASTIC PLACED IN A PERFECTLY ELASTIC FLUID AND SURROUNDED BY OTHER PERFECTLY ELASTIC SOLID BODIES WERE STRUCK AND MRADE TO VIBRATE ITS VIBRATIONS WOULD BY DEGREES BE COMMUNICATED BY MEANS OF THE UNDULA TIONS OR PULSATIONS THEY WOULD OCCASION IN THE ELASTIC FLUID RNEDIUM TO THE OTHER SURROUNDING SOLID AND ELASTIC BODIES IFAND THE MODE OF ITS COMMUNICATION 1S7 THESE SURROUNDING BODIES SHOULD HAPPEN TO BE ALREADY VIBRATING AND WITH THE SAME VELOCITY AS THAT WITH WHICH THE BELL IS MADE TO VIBRATE BY THE BLOW THE UNDULATIONS IN THE ELASTIC FLUID OCCA SIONED BY THE BELL WOULD NEITHER INCREASE NOR DIMINISH THE VELOCITY OR FREQUENCY OF THE VIBRATIONS OF THE SURROUNDING BODIES NEITHER WOULD THE UNDULATIONS CAUSED BY THE VIBRATIONS OF THESE BODIES TEND TO ACCELERATE OR TO RETARD THE VIBRATIONS OF THE BELL BUT IF THE VIBRATIONS OF THE BELL WERE MORE FREQUENT THAN THOSE OF THE SURROUNDING BODIES THE UNDULATIONS IT WOULD OCCASION IN THE ELASTIC FLUID WOULD TEND TO ACCELERATE THE VIBRATIONS OF THE SURROUNDING BODIES ON THE OTHER HAND THE UNDULATIONS OC CASIONED BY THE SLOWER VIBRATIONS OF THE SURROUNDING BODIES WOULD RETARD THE VIBRATIONS OF THE BELL AND THE BELL AND THE SURROUNDING BODIES WOULD CONTINUE TO AFFECT EACH OTHER UNTIL BY THE VIBRATIONS OF THE LATTER BEING GRADUALLY INCREASED AND THOSE OF THE FORMER DIMINISHED IN CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR ACTIONS ON EACH OTHER THEY WOULD ALL BE REDUCED TO THE SAME TONE SUPPOSING NOW THAT HEAT BE NOTHING MLNORE THAN THE MOTIONS OF THE CONSTITUENT PARTICLES OF BODIES AMONG THEMSELVES AN HYPOTHESIS OF ANCIENT DATE AND WHICH ALWAYS APPEARED TO ME TO BE VERY PROBABLE IF FOR THE BELL WE SUBSTITULTE A HOT BODY THE COOLING OF IT WILL BE ATTENDED BY A SERIES OF ACTIONS AND REACTIONS EXACTLY SIMILAR TO THOSE JUST DESCRIBED THE RAPID UNDULATIONS OCCASIONED IN THE SURROUNDING ETHEREAL FLUID BY THE SWIFT VIBRATIONS OF THE HOT BODY WILL ACT AS CALORIFIC RAYS ON THE NEIGHBOURING COLDER SOLID BODIE AND THE SLOWER UNDULATIONS OCCASIONED BY THE VIBRATIONS OF THOSE COLDER BODIES WILL ACT AS FRIGORIFIC RAYS ON THE HOT BODY AND THESE R CIPROCAL ACTIONS WILL CONTINUE BUT WITH DECREASING INTENSITY TILL THE NOT BODY

HAVE BECOME ISOCHRONOUS ACCORDING TO THIS HYPOTHESIS COLD CAN WITH NO MORE PROPRIETY BE CONSIDERED AS THE ABSENCE OF HEAT THAN A LOW OR GRAVE SOUND CAN BE CONSIDERED AS THE ABSENCE OF A HIGHER OR MORE ACUTE NOTE AND THE ADMISSION OF RAYS WHICH GENERATE COLD INVOLVES NO ABSURDITY AND CREATES NO CONFUSION OF IDEAS ON A SUPERFICIAL VIEW OF THE SUBJECT IT MAY PERHAPS APPEAR DIFFICULT TO RECONCILE SOLIDITY HARDNESS AND ELASTICITY WITH THOSE NEVERCEASING MOTIONS WHICH WE HAVE SUPPOSED TO EXIST AMONG THE CONSTITUENT PARTICLES OF ALL BODIES BUT A PATIENT INVESTIGA TION OF THE MATTER WILL SHOW THAT THE ADMISSION OF THAT SUPPOSED FACT INSTEAD OF RENDERING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO FORM DISTINCT AND SATISFACTORY IDEAS OF THE CAUSES ON WHICH THOSE QUALITIES OF BODIES DEPEND WILL RATHER FACILITATE THOSE ABSTRUSE RESEARCHES JUDGING FROM ALL THE OPERATIONS OF NATURE OF THE CAUSES OF WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO FORM ANY DISTINCT IDEAS WE ARE CERTAINLY LED TO CONCLUDE THAT THE FORCE OF DEAD MATTER AND PERHAPS OF LIVING MATTER ALSO OR ITS POWER OF AFFECTING THAT IS TO SAY OF MOVING OTHER MATTER OR OF RESISTING ITS IMPULSE DEPENDS ON ITS MOTION IF THEREFORE SOLID OR FLUID BODIES HAVE ANY POWERS WHATEVER EITHER OF IMPULSE OR OF RESISTANCE IT APPEARS TO ME TO BE MORE REASONABLE TO ASCRIBE THEM TO THE LIVING FORCES RESIDING IN THEM TO THE NEVERCEASING MOTIONS OF THEIR CONSTITUENT PARTICLES THAN TO SUPPOSE THEM TO BE DERIVED FROM THEIR WANT OF POWER AND THEIR TOTAL INDIFFERENCE TO MOTION AND TO REST NO REASONABLE OBJECTION AGAINST THIS HYPOTHESIS OF THE IN CESSANT MOTIONS OF THE CONSTITUENT PARTICLES OF ALL BODIES FOUNDED ON A SUPPOSITION THAT THERE IS NOT ROOM SUFFICIENT FOR THESEAND THE MODE OF ITS COMMUNICATION S9 MOTIONS CAN BE ADVANCED FOR WE HAVE ABUNDANT REASON TO CONCLUDE THAT IF THERE BE IN FACT ANY INDIVISIBLE SOLID PARTICLES OF MATTER WHICH HOWEVER IS VERY PROBLEMATICAL THESE PARTICLES MUST BE SO EXTREMELY SMALL COMPARED TO THE SPACES THEY OCCUPY THAT THERE MUST BE AMPLE ROOM FOR ALL KINDS OF MOTIONS AMONG THEM AND WHATEVER THE NATURE OR DIRECTIONS OF THESE INTERNAL IMO TIONS MAY BE AMONG THE CONSTITUENT PARTICLES OF A SOLID BODY AS LONG AS THESE CONSTITUENT PARTICLES IN THEIR MOTIONS DO NOT BREAK LOOSE FROM THE SYSTEMS TO WHICH THEY BELONG AND TO WHICH THEY ARE ATTACHED BY GRAVITATION AND RUN WILD IN THE VAST VOID BY WHICH EACH SYSTEM IS BOUNDED WHICH AS LONG AS THE KNOWN LAWS OF NATURE EXIST IS NO DOUBT IMPOSSIBLE THE FORM OR EXTERNAL APPEARANCE OF THE SOLID CANNOT BE SENSIBLY CHANGED BY THEN BUT IF THE MOTIONS OF THE CONSTITUENT PARTICLES OF ANY SOLID BODY BE EITHER INCREASED OR DIMINISHED IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE ACTIONS OR RADIATIONS OF OTHER DISTANT BODIES THIS EVENT COULD NOT HAPPEN WITHOUT PRODUCING SOME VISIBLE CHANGE IN THE SOLID BODY IF THE MOTIONS OF ITS CONSTITUENT PARTICLES WERE DIMINISHED BY THESE RADIATIONS IT SEEMS REASONABLE TO CONCLUDE THAT THEIR ELONGATIONS WOULD BECOME LESS AND CONSEQUENTLY THAT THE VO LUME OF THE BODY WOULD BE CONTRACTED BUT IF THE MOTIONS OF THESE PARTICLES WERE INCREASED WE MIGHT CONCLUDE A PRIORI THAT THE VOLUME OF THE BODY WOULD BE EXPANDED WE HAVE NOT SUFFICIENT DATA TO ENABLE US TO FORM DISTINCT IDEAS OF THE NATURE OF THE CHANGE WHICH TAKES PLACE WHEN A SOLID BODY IS MELTED BUT AS FUSION IS OCCASIONED BY HEAT THAT IS TO SAY BYI6O COUNT RUMFORDS ENQUIRY CONCERNING THE NATURE OF HEAT AN AUGMENTATION FROM WITHOUT OF THAT ACTION WHICH OCCASIONS EXPANSION IF EXPANSION BE OCCASIONED BY AN INCREASE OF THE MOTIONS OF THE CONSTITUENT PARTICLES OF THE BODY IT IS NO DOUBT A CERTAIN ADDITIONAL INCREASE OF THOSE MOTIONS WHICH CAUSES THE FORM OF THE BODY TO BE CHANGED  AND FROM A SOLID TO BECOME A FLUID SUBSTANCE AS LONG AS THE CONSTITUENT PARTICLES OF A SOLID BODY WHICH ARE AT THE SURFACE OF THAT BODY DO NOT IN THEIR MOTIONS PASS BY EACH OTHER THE BODY MUST NECESSARILY RETAIN ITS FORM OR SHAPE HOW EVER RAPID THOSE MOTIONS OR VIBRATIONS MAY BE BUT AS SOON AS THE MOTION OF THESE PARTICLES IS SO AUGMENTED THAT THEY CAN NO LONGER BE RESTRAINED OR RETAINED WITHIN THESE LIMITS THE REGULAR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PARTICLES WHICH THEY ACQUIRED IN CRYSTALLIZATION IS GRADUALLY DESTROYED  AND THE PARTICLES SO DETACHED FROM THE SOLID MASS FORM NEW AND INDEPENDENT SYSTEMS AND BECOME A LIQUID SUBSTANCE WHATEVER MAY BE THE FIGURES OF THE ORBITS WHICH THE PARTICLES OF A LIQUID DESCRIBE THE MEAN DISTANCES OF THOSE PARTICLES FROM EACH OTHER REMAIN NEARLY THE SAME AS WHEN THEY CONSTITUTED A SOLID AS APPEARS BY THE SMALL CHANGE OF SPECIFIC GRAVITY WHICH TAKES PLACE WHEN A SOLID IS MELTED AND BECOMES A LIQUID AND ON A SUPPOSITION THAT THEIR MOTIONS ARE REGULATED BY THE SAME LAWS WHICH REGULATE THE SOLAR SYSTEM IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE ADDITIONAL MOTION THEY MUST NECESSARILY ACQUIRE IN ORDER TO THEIR TAKING THE FLUID FORM CANNOT BE LOST BUT MUST COTINUE TO RESIDE IN THE LIQUID AND MUST AGAIN MAKE ITS APPEARANCE WHEN THE LIQUID CHANGES ITS FORM AND BECOMES A SOLID IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF HEAT IS REQUISITE TO TNELT A SOLID WHICH QUANTITY DISAPPEARS OR REMAINS LATENT IN THEI AND THE MODE OF ITS COMMUNICATION I61 LIQUID PRODUCED IN THAT PROCESS AND THAT THE SAME QUANTITY OF HEAT REAPPEARS WHEN THIS LIQUID IS CONGEALED AND BECOMES A SOLID BODY BUT BEFORE I PROCEED ANY FARTHER IN THESE ABSTRUSE SPECULAR TIONS I SHALL ENDEAVOUR TO INVESTIGATE SOME OF THE CONSEQUENCES WHICH WOULD NECESSARILY RESULT FROM THE RADIATIONS OF HOT AND OF COLD BODIES SUPPOSING THOSE RADIATIONS TO EXIST AND THEIR MOTIONS AND ACTIONS TO BE REGULATED BY CERTAIN ASSUMED LAWS AND FIRST IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE INTENSITY OF THE RAYS EMITTED BY A LUMINOUS POINT IN A PERFECTLY TRANSPARENT MEDIUM IS EVERY WHERE AS THE SQUARES OF THE DISTANCE FROM THAT POINT INVERSELY FOR THE INTENSITY OF THOSE RAYS MUST BE AS THEIR CON DENSATION AND THEIR CONDENSATION BEING DIMINISHED IN PROPLOR TIONL AS THE SPACE THEY OCCUPY IS IN REASED IF WE SUPPOSE ALL THE RAYS WHICH PROCEED IN ALL DIRECTIONS FROM ANY POINT TO SET OUT AT THE SAME INSTANT AND TO MOVE WITH THE SAME VELOCITY IN RIGHT LINES THESE SIMULTANEOUS RAYS OR UNDULATIONS WILL IN THEIR PROGRESS FORM A SPHERE WHICH SPHERE WILL INCREASE CONTINUALLY IN SIZE AS THE RAYS ADVANCE AND AS ALL THE RAYS MUST BE FOUND AT THE SURFACE OF THIS SPHERE THEIR INTENSITY OR CONDENSATION MUST NECESSARILY BE AS THE SURFACE OF THE SPHERE INVERSELY OR AS TIE SQUARES OF THE DISTANCE INVERSELY FROM THE CENTRE OF THE SPHERE OR WHICH IS THE SAME THING FROM THE LUMINOUS POINT FROM WHICH THESE RAYS PROCEED THE SURFACES OF SPHERES BEING TO EACH OTHER AS THE SQUARES OF THEIR RADII SUPPOSING NOW WHAT INDEED APPEARS TO BE INCONTROVERTIBLE THAT THE INTENSITY OF THE RAYS WHICH HOT AND COLD BODIES EMIT IN A MEDIUMN PERFECTLY TRANSPARENT FOLLOWS THE SAME LAW WE CAN DETERMINE WHAT EFFECTS MUST BE PRODUCED BY THE LARGENESS OR MDCCCIV Y162 COUTTT RUMFORDS EINQUIRY CONCERNING THE NATURE OF HEAT SMALLNESS OF THE CONFINED SPACE OF A ROOM FOR INSTANCE IN WHICH A HOT BODY IS PLACED TO COOL TO SIMPLIFY THIS INVESTIGATION WE WILL SUPPOSE THIS CONFINED SPACE TO BE A HOLLOW SPHERE OF ICE 9 FEET IN DIAMETER AT THE TEMPERATURE OF FREEZING WATER AND THE HOT BODY TO BE A SOLID SPHERE OF METAL 2 INCHES IN DIAMETER AT THE TEMPERATURE OF BOILING WATER PLACED IN THE CENTRE OF IT AND WE WILL SUPPOSE FARTHER THAT THIS HOLLOW SPHERE IS VOID OF AIR AND THAT THE COOL ING OF THE HOT BODY IS EFFECTED SOLELY BY THE FRIGORIFIC RAYS FROM THE ICE THE QUESTION TO BE DETERMINED IS IN WHAT MANNER THE COOLING OF THE HOT BODY WO ILD BE AFFECTED BY INCREASING THE DIAMETER OF THIS HOLLOW SPHERE OF ICE  LET US SUPPOSE ITS DIAMETER TO BE INCREASED TO I8 FEET ITS IN TERNAL SURFACE NVILI THEN BE TO THE SURFACE OF A SPHERE 9 FEET IN DIAMETER AS THE SQUARE OF 18 TO THE SQUARE OF 9 THAT IS TO SAY AS 32ZL4 TO SI OR AS 4 TO I AND AS THE QUANTITY OF FRIGORIFIC RAYS EMITTED ARE CATERNS PARIIBUS AS THE SURFACE FROM WHICH THEY PROCEED THE QUANTITY OF RAYS EMITTED BY THE INTERNAL SURFACE OF THE LARGER SPHERE WILL BE TO THE QUANTITY EMITTED BY THE INTERNAL SURFACE OF THE SMALLER AS 4 TO 1 BUT THE INTENSITIES OF THESE RAYS AT THE COMMON CENTRE OF THESE SPHERES WHERE THE HOT BODY IS PLACED BEING AS THE SQUARES OF THE DISTANCES FROM THE RADIATING POINTS INVERSELY THE INTENSITY OF THE RAYS FROM THE INTERNAL SURFACE OF THE SMALLER SPHERE MUST BE TO THE INTENSITY OF THE RAYS FROM THE INTERNAL SURFACE OF THE LARGER SPHERE AS 4 TO I AT THE COMMON CENTRE OF THOSE SPHERES NOW AS THE TIME OF THE COOLING OF THE HOT BODY WILL DEPENDAND THE MODE OF ITS COMMUNICATION 160 ON THE QUANTITY OF FRIGORIFIE RAYS WHICH ARRIVE AT ITS SURFACE AND ON THE INTENSITY OF THEIR ACTION AND AS THE INTENSITY OF THE RAYS FROM THE INTERNAL SURFACE OF THE SPHERE AT ITS CENTRE IS DIMI NISHED IN THE SAME PROPORTION AS THE SURFACE OF THE SPHERE IS AUGMENTED WHEN ITS DIAMETER IS INCREASED IT FOLLOWS THAT A HOT BODY PLACED IN THE CENTRE OF A HOLLOW SPHERE AT ANY GIVEN CONSTANT TEMPERATURE BELOW THAT OF THE HOT BODY WILL BE COOLED IN THE SAME TIME OR WITH THE SAME CELERITY WHATEVER MAY BE THE SIZE OF THE SPHERE IF THIS CONCLUSION BE WELL FOUNDED AND I SEE NO REASON TO SUSPECT THAT IT IS NOT SO IT WILL FOLLOW FROM THE PRINCIPLES ASSUMED THAT THE HOT BODY WILL BE COOLED IN THE SAME TIME IN WHATEVER PART OF THE HOLLOW SPHERE IT BE SITUATED AND AS THE COOLING OF THE BODY IS NOT AFFECTED THAT IS TO SAY ACCELERATED OR RETARDED EITHER BY THE GREATER OR SMALLER SIZE OF THE INCLOSED SPACE IN WHICH IT IS CONFINED OR BY ITS SITUATION IN THAT CONFINED SPACE SO IT CANNOT BE IN ANY MANNER AFFECTED EITHER BY THE FORM OF THAT HOLLOW SPACE OR BY THE PRESENCE OF A GREATER OR LESS NUMBER OF OTHER SOLID BODIES PROVIDED ALWAYS THAT ALL THESE SUR ROUNDING BODIES BE AT THE SAME CONSTANT TEMPERATURE IF HOWEVER ANY OF THESE SURROUNDING BODIES THE TEMPERATURE OF WHICH IS LIABLE TO BE SENSIBLY CHANGED DURING THE EXPERIMENT BY THE CALORIFIC RAYS EMITTED BY THE HOT BODY BE PLACED VERY NEAR THAT BODY THE COOLING OF THAT HOT BODY WILL BE RETARDED THE RAYS FROMN THIS NEIGHBOURING BODY SO HEATED BEING LESS FRIGORIFIC THAN THOSE FROM OTHER BODIES AT A GREATER DISTANCE WHICH IT INTERCEPTS THE RESULTS OF ALL MY EXPERIMENTS ON THE COOLING OF BODIES TENDED UNIFORMLY TO CONFIRM THE ABOVE CONCLUSIONS ADMITTING THAT THE COOLING OF A HOT BODY IS EFFECTED SOLELY BY Y2I65 COUNT RUMFORDS ENQUIRY CONCERNING THE NATURE OF HEAT THE RAYS WHICH PROCEED FROM COLDER BODIES AND THAT THESE RAYS LIKE THOSE OF LIGHT ARE REFLECTED REFRACTED AND CONCENTRATED ACCORDING TO CERTAIN KNOWN LAWS BY THE POLISHED SURFACES OF HIRRORS AND LENSES IT MIGHT PERHAPS BE IMAGINED THAT THE COOLING OF A HOT BODY MIGHT BE ACCELERATED OR RETARDED BY GIVING IT SOME PECULIAR FORM OR BY PLACING NEAR IT AND IN CERTAIN POSITIONS WITH RESPECT TO IT TWO OR MORE HIGHLY POLISHED REFLECTING MIRRORS AS THESE CONJECTURES IF WELL FOUNDED MIGHT LEAD TO EXPERI MENTS FROM THE RESULTS OF WHICH THE TRUTH OR FALSEHOOD OF THE HYPOTHESIS IN QUESTION MIGHT BE DEMONSTRATED IT IS OF MUCH IMPORTANCE THAT THIS MATTER SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED I SHALL THEREFORE BEG THE INDULGENCE OF THE SOCIETY WHILE I EN DEAVOUR TO EXAMINE IT WITH THAT CAREFUL ATTENTION WHICH IT APPEARS TO ME TO DESERVE WHEN DIFFERENT SOLID SUBSTANCES HEATED TO THE SAME DEGREE OF TEMPERATURE ARE EXPOSED IN THE AIR TO COOL THOSE AMONG THEM WHICH APPEAR TO THE TOUCH TO BE THE HOTTEST ARE NOT THOSE WHICH COOL THE FASTEST OR WHICH SEND OFF CALORIFIC RAYS THROUGH THE AIR IN THE GREATEST ABUNDANCE AS POLISHED METALS REFLECT A GREAT PART OF THE RAYS FROM OTHER BODIES WHICH ARRIVE AT THEIR SURFACES AND AS THEY ARE NEITHER HEATED NOR COOLED BY THE RAYS SO REFLECTED THEIR TEMPERATURES ARE SLOWLY CHANGED BY THE ACTIONS OF THE SURROUNDING BODIES AT A DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE WHEN A HOT POLISHED METALLIC BODY IS EXPOSED IN THE AIR TO COOL SURROUNDED BY OTHER BODIES AT THE SAME TEMPERATURE AS THAT OF THE COLD AIR AS MOST OF THE RAYS FROM THE SURROUNDING BODIES ARE REFLECTED AT THE POLISHED SURFACE OF THE HOT BODY IT IS EVIDENT THAT TWO SORTS OF RAYS MUST PROCEED FROM THE SURFACE OFAND THE MODE OF ITS COM MUNICATION I THAT BODY NAMELY THOSE CALORIFIC RAYS WHICH THAT HOT BODY EMITS AND THOSE OTHER RAYS WHICH WITH REGARD TO THE SUR ROUNDING BODIES ARE NEITHER CALORIFIC NOR FRIGORIFIC WHICH IT REFLECTS ON A CURSORY VIEW OF THE SUBJECT ONE MIGHT BE LED TO IMAGINE THAT AS THE RAYS WHICH PROCEED FROM THE HOT METALLIC BODY ARE OF TWO KINDS THE ENERGY OF THE CALORIFIC RAYS WHICH PROPERLY BELONG TO THE HOT BODY MIGHT BE DIMINISHED BY THOSE OTHER REFLECTED RAYS BY WHICH THEY ARE ACCOMPANIED AND WITH WHICH THEY MAY BE SAID TO BE MIXED BUT A MORE CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE MATTER WILL SHOW THAT THIS CANNOT BE THE CASE THAT IS TO SAY AS LONG AS ALL THE SURROUNDING BODIES CONTINUE TO BE AT THE SAME TEMPERATURE IF THE TEMPERATURE OF THE SURROUNDING BODIES BE DIFFERENT SUCH OF THEM WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE REFLECTED RAYS AS HAPPEN TO BE OF A TEMPERATURE DIFFERENT FROM THAT FROM WHICH THE RAY ORIGINATED BUT STILL THE EFFECTS PRODUCED BY THE RAYS EMITTED BY THE HOT BODY WILL BE THE SAME OR THEIR POWER OF EFFECTING CHANGES IN THE TEMPERATURES OF OTHER HOTTER OR COLDER BODIES WILL REMAIN UNDIMINISHED AND UNCHANGED THE REASON WHY THEIR EFFECTS ARE NOT MORE POWERFUL THAN THEY ARE FOUND TO BE IS NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE MIXED WITH OTHER RE FLECTED RAYS BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE FEW THE GREATER PART OF THE RAYS WHICH THE HOT BODY ACTUALLY EMITS BEING REFLECTED AND TURNED BACK UPON ITSELF BY THE REFLECTING SURFACE BY WHICH IT IS IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDED THAT THE REFLECTING SURFACE AT WHICH THE RAYS OF LIGHT ARE TURNED BACK AND REFLECTED WHICH IMPINGE AGAINST THE POLISHED SURFACE OF ANY SOLID OR FLUID BODY IS ACTUALLY

ANALOGIES BETWEEN THE RAYS OF LIGHT AND THOSE INVISIBLE RAYS WHICH ALL BODIES AT ALL TEMPERATURES APPEAR TO EMIT THAT WE CAN HARDLY DOUBT OF THEIR MOTIONS BEING REGULATED BY THE SAME LAWS PERHAPS THERE MAY BE NO OTHER DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM THAN EXISTS BETWEEN THOSE VIBRATIONS IN THE AIR WHICH ARE AUDIBLE AND THOSE WHICH MAKE NO SENSIBLE IMPRESSION ON OUR ORGANS OF HEARING IF THE EAR WERE SO CONSTRUCTED THAT WE COULD HEAR ALL THE MOTIONS WHICH TAKE PLACE IN THE AIR WE SHOULD NO DOUBT BE STUNNED WITH THE NOISE AND IF OUR EYES WERE SO CONSTRUCTED AS TO SEE ALL THE RAYS WHICH ARE EMITTED CONTINUALLY BY DAY AND BY NIGHT BY THE BODIES WHICH SURROUND US WE SHOULD BE DAZZLED AND CONFOUNDED BY THAT INSUPPORTABLE FLOOD OF LIGHT POURED IN UPON US ON EVERY SIDE TAKING IT FOR GRANTED THAT THESE INVISIBLE RADIATIONS EXIST WE WILL ENDEAVOUR TO TRACE THE EFFECTS WHICH MUST NECESSARILY BE PRODUCED BY THEM IN ORDER TO SEE IF THESE INVESTIGATIONS WILL NOT LEAD US TO A DISCOVERY OF THE CAUSES

WITHOUT ANY VARIATION IF WE SUPPOSE THE FLOOR CEILING WALLS OF THE ROOM AND DOORS AND WINDOWS TO BE LINED WITH A COVERING OF ICE AT THE TEMPERA TURE OF FREEZING WATER WE CAN THEN WITHOUT ANY DIFFICULTY CON CEIVE THAT THE TEMPERATURE OF THE ROOM MAY REMAIN THE SAMEAND THE MODE OF ITS COMMUNICATION I67 NOTWITHSTANDING THE PRESENCE OF HOTTER BODIES WHICH ARE BROUGHT INTO IT FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING EXPERIMENTS LET US NOW SUPPOSE ONE OF THE MIRRORS TO BE AT THE TEMPERA TURE OF FREEZING AND THE OTHER AT THAT OF BOILING WATER AND LET US SEE WHAT EFFECTS THEY WOULD PRODUCE ON EACH OTHER BY THEIR RADIATIONS AND FIRST WITH RESPECT TO THE HOT MIRROR IT IS EVIDENT THAT IT WILL BE COOLED NOT ONLY BY THE FRIGORIFIC RAYS WHICH PROCEED FROM THE COLD METAL OF WHICH THE OPPOSITE MIRROR IS CONSTRUCTED BUT ALSO BY SUCH OF THE FRIGORIFIC RAYS FROM THE SIDES OF THE ROOM AS IMPINGING AGAINST THE POLISHED REFLECTING SURFACE OF THE COLD MIRROR AND BEING REFLECTED BY THAT SURFACE HAPPEN TO FALL ON THE SURFACE OF THE HOT MIRROR WITHOUT BEING REFLECTED BY IT BUT AS THE QUANTITY OF RAYS WHICH THE COLD MIRROR REFLECTS IS GREATER IN PROPORTION AS THE REFLECTING SURFACE IS MORE PERFECT WHILE THE QUANTITY OF RAYS EMITTED BY THIS COLD MIRROR IS LESS IN PROPORTION AS ITS REFLECTING SURFACE IS MORE PERFECT IT IS EX TREMELY PROBABLE THAT THE TOTAL QUANTITY OF FRIGORIFIC RAYS EMITTED AND REFLECTED WHICH COMING FROM THE SURFACE OF THE COLD MIRROR IMPINGE AGAINST THE SURFACE OF THE HOT MIRROR WILL BE THE SAME WHATEVER MAY BE THE DEGREE OF POLISH OR REFLECTING POWER OF THE COLD MIRROR AND IF THIS BE THE CASE WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT THE PRESENCE OF THIS MIRROR WILL HAVE NO EFFECT WHATEVER ON THE HOT MIRROR OR THAT IT WILL NO MORE EXPEDITE ITS COOLING THAN ANY OTHER BODY OF ANY OTHER FORM WOULD DO AT THE SAME DISTANCE AND OCCUPYING THE SAME SPACE IT MIGHT PERHAPS BE IMAGINED THAT THEFORMN OF THE COLD MIRROR MIGHT CONCENTRATE THE RAYS IT EMITS AND REFLECTS AND BY SUCH CONCENTRATION PRODUCE A GREATER EFFECT ON THE OPPOSITE MIRROR THAN IF ITS SURFACE WERE FLAT OR OF ANY OTHER FORM  BUT A MOREI68 COUNT RUMFORDS ENQUIRY CONCERNING THE NATURE OF HEAT ATTENTIVE EXAMINATION OF THE MATTER WILL SHOW THAT NO SUCH CON CENTRATION ACTUALLY TAKES PLACE FOR WITH REGARD TO THOSE RAYS WHICH ARE EMITTED BY THIS COLD BODY AS THEY PROCEED FROM EACH POINT OF ITS SURFACE IN ALL DIRECTIONS IT IS PERFECTLY EVIDENT THAT THESE ARE NOT CONCENTRATED AND WITH RESPECT TO THOSE WHICH ARE REJECTED IT IS EQUIALLY CERTAIN THAT THEY ARE NOT CONCENTRATED BECAUSE IN ORDER TO THEIR BEING CONCENTRATED THEY MUST ARRIVE AT THE SURFACE OF THE MIRROR IN PARALLEL LINES AND IN THE DIRECTION OF THE AXIS OF THE MIRROR WHICH UNDER THE GIVEN CIRCUMSTANCES IS EVIDENTLY IMPOSSIBE HENCE WE SEE THAT THE PRESENCE OF THE COLD MIRROR WILL NOT TEND IN THE SMALLEST DEGREE EITHER TO ACCELERATE OR TO RETARD THE COOLING OF THR HOT MIRROR THAT IS TO SAY PROVIDED ITS TEM PERATURE BE NOT RAISED BY THE CALORIFIC RAYS FROM THE HOT MIRROR IF ITS TEMPERATURE BE RAISED BY THOSE RAYS IT WILL TEND TO RETARD THE COOLING OF THE HOT MIRROR BUT EVEN IN THIS CASE IT WILL NOT RETARD IT MORE THAN ANY OTHER POLISLHED METALLIC BODY WOULD DO OF ANY OTHER FORM HAVING THE SAME AREA OR QUANTITY OF SURFACE OPPOSED TO THE HOT MIRROR AND BEING PLACED AT THE SAMIE DISTANCE FROM IT BY A SIMILAR TRAIN OF REASONING IT MAY BE SHOWN THAT THE FRRM OF THE HOT BODY THAT OF A CONCAVE MIRROR WILL CONTRIBUTE NOTHING TO THE EFFECT IT WILL PRODUCE ON THE COLD MIRROR IN HEATING IT BY THE CALORIFIC RAYS IT EMITS AND THAT IT WILL ITSELF BE COOLED NEITHER FASTER NOR SLOWER ON ACCOUNT OF ITS PECULIAR FORM LET US NOW SUPPOSE BOTH MIRRORS TO BE AT THE TEMPERATURE PRECISELY OF THE ROOM THAT OF FREEZING WATER AND THAT A BULLET OR OTHER SMALL BODY OF A SPHERICAL FORM AT THE TEMPERA TURE OF BOILING WATER BE PLACED IN THE FOCUS OF ONE OF THE MIRRORS WHICH MIRROR WE SHALL CALL AALZD THE MODE OF ITS COMMUN CATION 16A9 AS THE RAYS EMITTED BY THIS HOT BODY ARE SENT OFF IN RIGHT LINES IN ALL DIRECTIONS IN THE SAME MANNER AS LIGHT IS EMITTED BY LU MINOUS BODIES ALL THOSE RAYS WHICH FALL ON THE CONCAVE POLISHED SURFACE OF THE MIRROR A WILL BE REFLECTED AS IS WELL KNOWN IN LINES NEARLY PARALLEL TO THE AXIS OF THE MIRROR THEY WILL CONSET QUENTLY FALL ON THE CONCAVE POLISHED SURFACE OF THE OPPOSITE MIRROR B AND BEING THERE AGAIN REFLECTED THEY W ILL BE CORICEN TRATED AT THE FOCUS OF THE SECOND MIRROR IF NOW A SENSIBLE THERMOMETER AT THE TEMPERATURE OF THE ROOM BE PLACED IN THIS FOCUS IT WILL IMMEDIATELY BEGIN TO RISE IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE HEAT GENERATED IN IT BY THE ACTION OF THESE CALORIFIC RAYS SO ACCUAULAATED IN THAT PLACE IF INSTEAD OF BEING PLACED IN THE FOCUS OF THIS SECOND MIRROR THE THERMOMETER BE PLACED AT A VERY SMALL DISTANCE FROM THAT FOCUS ON ONE SIDE OF IT THE INSTRUMENT HOWEVER SENSIBLE IT MAY BE WILL NOT BE APPARENTLY AFFECTED BY THE RAYS FROM THE HOT BODY THIS EXPERINWENT WHICH IS OF ANCIENT DATE HAS OFTEN BEEN MADE AND ALWAYS WITH THE SAME RESULTS LET US NOW SUPPOSE THE HOT BODY TO BE REMOVED FROM THE FOCUS OF THE MIRROR A AND THAT A COLDER BODY BE SUBSTITUTED IN PLACE OF IT AND IN THE FIRST PLACE WE WILL SUPPOSE THE TEMPERATURE OF THIS COLDER BODY TO BE THAT OF FREEZING WATER OR JUST EQUAL TO THAT WHICH REIGNS IN THE ROOM AS THE RAYS WHICH BODIES AT THE SAME TEMPERATURE SEND OFF FROMN ONE TO THE OTHER HAVE NO TENDENCY TO INCREASE OR TO D MINISH THE TEMPERATURE OF THOSE BODIES THE CONCENTRATION OF RAYS IN THE FOCUS OF THE MIRROR B PROCEEDING FROM THE ICECOLD BODY PLACED IN THE FOCUS OF THE MIRROR A CAN HAVE NO EFFECT ON A MDCCCIV Z170 COUNT RUM ORDS ENQUDRY CONCERNING THE NATURE OF FEAT THERMOMETER AT THE SAME TEMPERATURE WHICH IS EXPOSED TO THEIR ACTION IF HEAT BE A VIBRATRY T MOTION

BODIES AT THE SURFACES OF WHICH THEY ARRIVE PROVIDED THE VIBRATIONS OF THE CONSTITUENT PARTICLES OF SUCH BODIES ARE AT THAT TIME ISOCHRONOUS WITH THE VIBRATIONS OF THE CONSTITUENT PARTICLES OF THE BODY FROM WHICH THESE UNDULATIONS PROCEED BUT TO RETURN TO OUR EX PERIMENT SUPPOSE NOW THAT INSTEAD OF THIS ICECOLD BODY ANOTHER MUCH COLDER AT THE TEMPERATURE OF FREEZING MERCURY FOR INSTANCE BE PLACED IN THE FOCUS OF THE MIRROR A AND THAT A THERMOMETER AT THE TEMPERATURE OF FREEZING WATER BE PLACED IN THE FOCUS OF THE MIRROR B WHAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO BE THE RESULT OF THIS EX PERIMENT THAT THE THERMOMETER WOULD FALL IN CONSEQUENCE OF ITS BEING COOLED BY THE ACCUMULATION OF FRIGORIFIC RAYS PROCEEDING FROM THIS VERY COLD BODY NOW THIS IS WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN THE CELEBRATED EXPE RIMENT OF MY INGENIOUS FRIEND PROFESSOR PICTET OF GENEVA SEVERAL ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO EXPLAIN THE RESULT OF THAT EXPERIMENT ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT CALORIC HAS A REAL OR MATERIAL EXISTENCE AND THAT RADIANT HEAT IS THAT SUBSTANCE EMITTED AND SENT OFF IN RIGHT LINES IN ALL DIRECTIONS FROM THE SURFACES OF HOT BODIES BUT NONE OF THESE LXPLANATIONS APPEAR TO ME TO BEANDR THE MODE OF ITS CO ZMIN ICO SATISFACTORY ONE OF THE MOST PLAUSIBLE OF THEM IS THAT WHICH IS FOUNDED ON A SUPPOSITION THAT CALORIC IS EMITTED CONTINUALLY UNDER THE FORM OF RADIANT HEAT BY ALL BODIES AT ALL TEMPERATURES BUT IN GREATER ABUNDANCE BY HOT BODIES THAN BY SUCH AS ARE COLDER AND THAT A BODY AT THE SAME TIME THAT IT SENDS OFF RADIANT CALORIC IN ALL DIRECTIONS TO THIE BODIES BY WHICH IT IS SUR ROUNDED RECEIVES IT IN RETURN IN GREATER OR LESS QUANTITIES FROM ALL THOSE BODIES THAT IN ALL CASES WHERE A BODY IN ANY GIVEN TIME RECEIVES MORE RADIANT CALORIC THAN IT GIVES OFT AN ACCUMU LATION OF CALORIC IN THE BODY TTAKES PLACE IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH ACCUMULATION IT BECOMES HOTTER   BUT WHEN IT GIVES OFF MORE CALORIC IN ANY GIVEN TIME THAN IT RECEIVES ITS QUANTITY OF CALORIC IS GRADUALLY DIMINISHED AND IT BECOMES COLDER AND THAT A CONS STAN TEMPERATURE RESULTS FROM THE QUAITIAE OF CALORIC EMITTED AND RECEIVED CONTINUALLY BEING EQUAL BUT BESIDES THE DIFFICULTY OF EXPLAINING HOW OR BY WHAT MECHANISM IT CAN BE POSSIBLE FOR THE SAME BODY TO RECEIVE AND RETAIN AND REJECT AND DRIVE AWAY THE SAME KIND OF SUBTANCE AT ONE AND THE SAME TIM AN OPERATION NOT ONLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE BUT APPARENTLY IIM POSSIBLE AND TO WHICH THERE IS NOTHING TO BE FOTUND ANALOGOUS TO RENDER IT PROBABLE MANY OTHER REASONS MIGHT BE BROUGHT TO SLOW THAT THI HYPOTHESIS OF THE SUPPOSED CONTINUAL INTERCHANGES OF CALORIC BETWEEN NEIGIHBOURING BODIES IS VERY IMPROBABLE AND AMONG THE REST THERE IS O LE WHICH APPEARS TO ME TO BE QUIT CONCLUSIVE AS THE POINT INDISPUTE SEEMIS TO BE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO THE SCIENC OF HEAT I SHALL ENDEAVOUR TO EXAMINE IT WITH ALL PSSIBLE ATTENTION AND IN ORDER TO PUT THE HYPOTHESIS IN QUES TION TO THE TEST WE WILL SEE IF IT WILL ACCORD WITH THE RESULTS OF Z2172 COUNT RUMFORDS ENQUIRY CONCERNING THE NATURE OF HEAT SOME OF THE FOREGOING EXPERIMENTS WHICH IN ORDER TO THEIR BEING MORE EASILY COMPREHENDED AND EXAMINED I SHALL ELUCIDATE BY FIGURES LET THE TWO OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE CYLINDERS A AND B PLATE V FIG 4 REPRESENT THE TWO VERTICAL METALLIC DISKS OF EQUAL DI MENSIONS WHICH WERE PRESENTED AT THE SAME TIME TO THE BALL OF THE THERMOSCOPE C IN THE EXPERIMENT NO 23 IN THAT EXPERIMENT THE DISK A BEING AT THE TEMPERATURE OF 32 F THAT OF FREEZING WATER AND THE DISK B AT I IE F WHILE THE BALL OF THE THERMOSCOPE CA AND ALL OTHER SURROUNDING BODIES WERE AT 79 IT WAS FOUND THAT THE TEMPERATURE OF THE THERMO SCOPE WAS NOT CHANGED BY THE SIMULTANEOUS ACTIONS OF THESE TWVO BODIES THE ONE HOT AND THE OTHER COLD IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS RESULT ON THE HYPOTHESIS BEFORE MENTIONED WE MUST BEGIN BY SUPPOSING THAT THE BALL OF THE THERMOSCOPE GIVES OFF RADIANT CALORIC CONTINUALLY IN ALL DIREC TIONS AND RECEIVES IT IN RETURN FROM THE SURFACES OF ALL THE BODIES BY WHICH IT IS SURROUNDED WITH REGARD TO ALL THESE SURROUNDING BODIES EXCEPTING THE DISKS A AND B AS THEY ARE AT THE SAME TEMPERATURE AS THE BALL OF THE THERMOSCOPE THAT OF 72 THEY WILL GIVE CONTINUALLY TO THAT INSTRUMENT JUST AS MUCH RADIANT CALORIC AS THEY RECEIVE FROM IT  AND NO CHANGE OF TEMPERATURE WILL RESULT FROM THESE EQUAL INTERCHANGES BUT IN RESPECT TO THE DISK A AS THAT IS COLDER THAN THE BALL OF THE THERMOSCOPE IT RETURNS TO IT A SMALLER QUANTITY OF RADIANT CALORIC THAN IT RECEIVES FROM IT CONSEQUENTLY THE THERMOSCOPE RECEIVES CONTINUALLY LESS THAN IT GIVES IT WOULD OF COURSE BE GRADUALLY EXHAUSTED OF CALORIC AND BECOME COLDER WERE IT NOTAND THE MODE OF ITS COMMUNICATION 173 FOR THE COMPENSATION IT RECEIVES FOR THIS LOSS FROM THE DISK B THIS DISK BEING HOTTER THAN THE THERMOSCOPE GIVES TO IT CON TINUALLY MORE RADIANT CALORIC THAN IT RECEIVES FROMN IT AND WERE IT NOT FOR THE SIMULTANEOUS LOSS OF CALORIC WHICH THE INSTRU MENT SUSTAINS IN ITS INTERCHANGES IWITH THE COLD DISK A ITS QUANTITY OF CALORIC WOULD BE AUGMENTED AND IT WOULD BECOME HOTTER NOW AS THE TEMPERATURE OF THE BALL OF THE THERMOSCOPE IS AN ARITHMETICAL MEAN BETWEEN THAT OF THE DISK A AND THAT OF THE DISK B IT IS REASONABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT THE THERMOSCOPE RECEIVES JUST AS MUCH MORE CALORIC FROM B THAN IT GIVES TO IT AS IT GIVES TO A MORE THAN IT RECEIVES FROM IT AND IF THAT BE THE CASE IN FACT IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE SIMULTANEOUS ACTIONS OF THE TWO DISKS ON THE BALL OF THE THERMOSCOPE OR THE TRAFFIC WHICH THEY CARRY ON WITH IT IN CALORIC CAN NEITHER TEND TO INCREASE NOR TO DI MINISH THE ORIGINAL STOCK OF THAT SUBSTANCE BELONGING TO THAT INSTRUMENT CONSEQUENTLY THE INSTRUMENT WILL NEITHER BE HEATED NOR COOLED BY THESE INTERCHANGES BUT WILL CONTINUE INVARIABLY AT THE SAME CONSTANT TEMPERATURE THIS EXPLANATION IS PLAUSIBLE BUT BEFORE THE HYPOTHESIS ON WHICH IT IS FOUNDED CAN BE ADMITTED WE MUST SEE IF IT WILL AGREE WITH THE RESULTS OF OTHER EXPERIMENTS FOR THE GREATEST CARE OUGHT ALWAYS TO BE USED IN THE ADMISSION OF HYPOTHESES IN PHY SICAL RESEARCHES  AND IN NO CASE CAN IT BE MORE INDISPENSABLY NECESSARY THAN WHERE AN HYPOTHESIS HAS EVIDENTLY BEEN CON TRIVED FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF EXPLAINING A SINGLE EXPERIMENT OR ELUCIDATING A NEW FACT WHEN THE SURFACE OF THE METALLIC DISK B WAS BLACKENED BY HOLDING IT OVER THE FLAME OF A CANDLE THE INTENSITY OF ITS RADIATION174 C8OUNT RUMRODS ENQUIRY CONCERNING TBE NATRE OF LHEAT AT THE GIVEN TEMPERATURE THAT OF 1120 WAS FOUND TO BE VERY CONSIDERABLY INCREASED AND WHEN BEING SO BLACKENED IT WAS AGAIN PRESENTED TO THE BALL OF THE THERMOSCOPE AT THE SAME DISTANCE AS IN THE LASTMENTIONED EXPERIMENT AND THE COLD DISK A AT THE TEMPERATURE OF 32 WAS PLACED OPPOSITE TO IT AT AN EQUAL DISTANCE AS REPRESENTED IN FIG 5 THE THERMOSCOPE IN STEAD OF CONTINUING TO RETAIN ITS ORIGINAL TEMPERATURE THAT OF 720 WAS NOW GRADUALLY HEATED THERE IS NOTHING IT IS TRUE IN THAT EVENT WHICH APPEARS DIFFI CULT TO EXPLAIN ON THE ASSUMED PRINCIPLES  FOR IF THE QUANTITY OF RADIANT CALORIC EMITTED BY THE DISK B BE INCREASED BY BLACKENING ITS SURFACE THE QUANTITY RECEIVED FROM IT BY THE BALL OF THE THER MOSCOPE MUST BE INCREASED ALSO AND THAT ADDITIONAL QUANTITY MUST OF COURSE TEND TO RAISE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE INSTRUMENT BUT HERE IS AN EXPERIMENT WHICH CANNOT BE EXPLAINED ON THOSE PRINCIPLES THE SURFACE OF THE COLD DISK A HAVING BEEN BLACK ENED AS WELL AS THAT OF THE HOT DISK B WHEN BOTH DISKS BLACKENED WERE AGAIN PRESENTED AT EQUAL DISTANCES TO THE BALL OF THE THERMO SCOPE AS REPRESENTED IN FIG 6 IT WAS FOUND THAT THE ORIGINAL TEMPERATURE OF THE THERNOSCOPE REMAINED UNCHANGED THE RESULT OF THIS MOST INTERESTING EXPERIMENT PROVES THAT THE BALL OF THE THERMOSCOPE WAS JUST AS MUCH COOLED BY THE INFLUENCE OF THE COLD BLACKENED DISK AS IT WAS HEATED BY THE HOT BLACKENED DISK NOW AS IT WAS FOUND BY EXPERIMENT THAT THE INTENSITY OF THE RADIATION OF THE DISK B WAS IICREASED BY THE BLACKENING OF THE SURFACE OF THAT DISK WE MUST CONCLUDE THAT THE INTENSITY OF THE RADIATION OF THE DISK A WAS LIKEWISE INCREASED BY THE USEAND THE MODE OF ITS COMMUNICATION AC OF THE SAME MEANS BUT IF THOSE RADIATIONS BE CALORIC EMITTED BY THOSE BODIES WHICH THE HYPOTHESIS IN QUESTION SUPPOSES HOW DID IT HAPPEN THAT THE BALL OF THE THERMOSCOPE INSTEAD OF BEING MORE HEATED BY THE ADDITIONAL QUANTITY OF CALORIC WHICH IT RECEIVED IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE BLACKENING OF THE DISK A WAS ACTUALLY MORE COOLED  IT MAY PERHAPS BE SAID BY THE ADVOCATES FOR THE HYPOTHESIS IN QUESTION THAT THE BLACKENING OF THE SURFACE OF THE DISK A CAUSED A GREATER QUANTITY OF CALORIC TO BE SENT OFF TO IT BY THE BALL OF THE THERMOSCOPE WITHOUT INSISTING ON AN EXPLANATION OF THE MODE OF ACTION OF THE CAUSE WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO PRODUCE THIS EFFECT WHICH I MIGHT CERTAINLY DO AS THE SUPPOSITION IS PERFECTLY GRATUITOUS I WILL CONTENT MYSELF WITH JUST OBSERVING THAT AS THE SURFACE OF THE OPPOSITE DISK WAS ALSO BLACKENED THIS SUPPOSED AUGMENTATION OF THE QUANTITY OF CALORIC EMITTED BY THE BALL OF THE THERMOSCOPE OCCASIONED BY THE BLACKENING OF THE SUR FACES OF THE BODIES PRESENTED TO IT CAN BE OF NO USE IN EXPLAINING THE PHENOMENA IN QUESTION THE RESULTS OF THE TWO LAST MENTIONED EXPERIMENTS APPEAR TO ME TO BE VERY IMPORTANT AND I DO NOT SEE HOW THEY CAN BE RE CONCILLED WITH THE OPINIONS OF MODERN CHEMISTS RESPECTING THE NAIJIRE OF HEAT IN ORDER TO SIMPLIFY OUR SPECULATIONS ON THIS ABSTRUSE SUBJECT WE HAVE HITHERTO SUPPOSED THAT DIFREECE OF TEMPERATURE DEPENDS SOLELY ON THE DIFFERENCE OF THE TIMES OF THE VIBRATIONS OF THE COM PUNENT PARTICLES OF BODIES IT IS POSSIBLE HOWEVER AND EVEN PROBABLE THAT IT DEPENDS PRINCIPALLY ON THE VELOCITIES OF THOSE PARTICLES FOR IT IS EASY TO PERCEIVE THAT THE MORE RAPID THE MOTIONS OF THOSE PARTICLES ARE THE GREATER THEIR ELONGATIONS MUST176 COUNT RUMFORDS ENQUIRY CONCERNING THE NATURE OF HEAT BE IN THEIR VIBRATIONS  AND THE MORE OF COURSE WILL THE VOLUME OF THE BODY THEY COMPOSE BE EXPANDED IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE PULSATIONS OCCASIONED IN AN ELASTIC FLUID BY THE VIBRATIONS OF AN ELASTIC SOLID BODY PROCEED FROM THAT BODY IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND THAT THESE PULSATIONS ARE EVERY WHERE THAT IS TO SAY AT ALL DISTANCES FROM THE BODY ISOCHRON US WITH THE VIBRATIONS OF THE SOLID BODY IT IS KNOWN ALSO THAT THE MEAN VELOCITY OF ANY INDIVIDUAL PARTICLE OF THE FLUID IS LESS IN PROPORTION AS THE DISTANCE OF THE PARTICLE IS GREATER FROM THE CENTRE FROM WHICH THESE PULSATIONS PROCEED IN THE CASE OF THE PULSATIONS OCCASIONED IN THE AIR BY THE VIBRA TIONS OF SONOROUS BODIES THOSE PULSATIONS ARE EVERY WHERE ISOCHRONOUS WITH THE VIBRATIONS OF THE SONOROUS BODY AND THE TIME OR FREQUENCY OF THOSE PULSATIONS DETERMINES THE NOTE BUT IT IS THE VELOCITY OF THE PARTICLES OF THE AIR OR THE BREADTH OF THE WAVE ON WHICH THE FRCE OR STRENGTH OF THE SOUND DEPENDS  AND THIS VELOCITY BECOMING LESS AS THE DISTANCE FROMN THE SONOROUS BODY INCREASES THE SOUND IS WEAKENED INL THE SAME PROPORTION THERE ARE SEVERAL CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH MIGHT LEAD US TO SUSPECT THAT COLOUR DEPENDS ON THE FREQUENCY OF THOSE PULSATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN SUPPOSED TO CONSTITUTE LIGHT AND THAT THE HEAT PRODUCED BY THEM IS IN PROPORTION TO THEIRFORCE IF THIS SUPPOSITION SHOULD BE WELL FOUNDED A KNOWLEDGE OF THAT IMPORTANT FACT MIGHT PERHAPS ENABLE US TO EXPLAIN SEVERAL VERY INTERESTING PHENOMENA THE COMBUSTION OF INFLAMMABLE BODIES FOR INSTANCE AND THE GREAT INTENSITY OF THE HEAT WHICH IS PRODUCED BY THE CONCENTRATON OF CALORIFIC RAYS THERE ARE SEVERAL WELL KNOWN EXPERIMENTS WITH BURNING GLASSES WHICH SHOW THAT THE INTENSITY OF THE HEAT GENERATED BYAND THE MODE OF ITS COMMUNICATION I77 THE CONCENTRATION OF THE SOLAR RAYS IS NOT SIMPLY AS THE CONDEN SATION OF THOSE RAYS BUT IN A HIGHER PROPORTION AND THAT IT DEPENDS MUCH ON THEIR DIRECTION BEING GREATER AS THE ANGLE IS GREATER AT WHICH THEY MEET AT THE FOCUS OF THE LENS THAT FACT IS CERTAINLY VERY REMARKABLE IT HAS OFTEN BEEN THE SUBJECT OF MY MEDITATIONS AND IT HAS CONTRIBUTED NOT A LITTLE TO THE OPINION I HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ADOPT RESPECTING THE NATURE OF LIGHT AND OF HEAT I NEVER COULD RECONCILE IT WITH THE SUPPOSI TION THAT HEAT IS CAUSED BY THE ACCUMULATION OF ANY THING EMITED BY THE SUN OR BY ANY OTHER BODY WHICH SENDS OFF CALORIFIC RADIATIONS IGESERVING FOR A FITURE COMMUNICATION AN ACCOUNT OF THE SEQUEL OF MY ENQUIRIES RESPECTING THE SUBJECT WHICH I HAVE UN DERTAKEN TO INVESTIGATE I SHALL CONCLUDE THIS LONG PAPER WITH SOME OBSERVATIONS CONCERNING THE PRACTICAL USES THAT MAY BE DERIVED FROM A KNOWLEDGE OF THE FACTS WHICH HAVE BEEN ESTA BLISHED BY THE RESULTS OF THE FOREGOING EXPERIMENTS IN ALL CASES WHERE IT IS DESIGNED TO PRESERVE THE HEAT OF ANY SUBSTANCE WHICH IS CONFINEDI IN A METALLIC VESSEL IT WILL GREATLY CONTRIBUTE TO THAT END IF THE EXTERNAL SURFACE OF THE VESSEL BE VERY CLEAN AND BRIGHT BUT IF THE OBJECT BE TO COOL ANY THING QUICKLY IN A METALLIC VESSEL THE EXTERNAL SURFACE OF THE VESSEL SHOULD BE PAINTED OR COVERED WAITH SOME OF THOSE SUB STANCES WHICH HAVE BEEN FOUND TO EMIT CALORIFIC RAYS IN GREAT ABUNDANCE POLISHED TEAURNS MAY BE KEPT BOILING HOT WITH A MUCH LESS EXPENCE OF SPIRIT OF WINE BURNT IN A LAMP UNDER THEMN

A SMALLER FIRE THAN SSUCH AS ARE BLACK AND DIRTY BUT THE BOTTOM OF A SAUCEPAN OR BOILER SHOULD BE BLACKENED IN ORDER THAT ITS CONTENTS MAY BE MADE TO BOIL QUICKLY AND WITH A SMALL EXPENCE OF FUEL WHEN KITCHEN UTENSILS ARE USED OVER A FIRE OF SEACOAL OR OF WOOD THERE WILL BE NO NECESSITY FOR BLACKENING THEIR BOTTOMS FOR THEY WILL SOON BE MADE BLACK BY THE SMOKE BUT WHEN THEY ARE USED OVER A CLEAR FIRE MADE WITH CHARCOAL IT WILL BE ADVISEABLE TO BLACKEN THEMR WHICH MAY BE DONE IN A FEW MO MENTS BY HOLDING THEM OVER A WOOD OR COAL FIRE OR OVER THE FLAME OF A LAMP OR CANDLE PROPOSALS HAVE OFTEN BEEN MADE FOR CONSTRUCTING THE BROAD AND SHALLOW VESSELS FLATS IN WHICH BREWERS COOL THEIR WORT OF METAL ON A SUPPOSITION THAT THE PROCESS OF COOLING WOULD GO ON FASTER IN A METALLIC VESSEL THAN IN A WOODEN VESSEL BUT THIS WOULD NOT BE FOUND TO BE THE CASE IN FACT A METALLIC SURFACE BEING ILL CALCULATED FOR EXPEDITING THE EMISSION OF CALORIFIC RAYS THE GREAT THICKNESS OF THE TIMBER OF WHICH BREWERS FLATS ARE COMMONLY MADE IS A CIRCUMSTANCE VERY FAVOURABLE TO A SPEEDY COOLING OF THE WORT FOR WHEN THE FLATS ARE EMPTY THIS MASS OF WET WOOD IS MUCH COOLED NOT ONLY BY THE COLD AIR WHICH PASSES OVER IT BUT ALSO AND MORE ESPECIALLY BY EVAPORATION AND WHEN THE FLAT IS AGAIN FILLED WITH HOT WORT A GREAT PART OF THE HEAT OF THAT LIQUID IS ABSORBED BY THE COLD WOOD IN ALL CASES WHERE METALLIC TUBES FILLED WITH STEAM ARE USEDAND THE MODE OF ITS COMMUNICATION 179 FOR WARMING ROOMS OR FOR HEATING DRYINGROOMS THE EXTERNAL SURFACE OF THOSE TUBES SHOULD BE PAINTED OR COVERED WITH SOME SUBSTANCE WHICH FACILITATES THE EMISSION OF CALORIFIC RAYS A COVERING OF THIN PAPER WILL ANSWER THAT PURPOSE VERY WELL ESPE CIALLY IF IT BE BLACK AND IF IT BE CLOSELY AND FIRMLY ATTACHED TO THE SURFACE OF THE METAL WITH GLUE TUBES WHICH ARE DESIGNED FOR CONVEYING HOT STEAM FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER SHOULD EITHER BE WELL COVERED UP WITH WARM COVERING OR SHOULD BE KEPT CLEAN AND BRIGHT IT WOULD I AM PERSUADED BE WORTH WHILE IN MANY CASES TO GILD THEM OR AT LEAST TO COVER THEM WITH WHAT IS CALLED GILT PAPER OR WITH TIN FOIL OR SOME OTHER METALLIC SUBSTANCE WHICH DOES NOT EASILY TARNISH IN THE AIR THE CYLINDERS AND PRINCIPAL STEAMTUBES OF STEAMENGINES MIGHT BE COVERED FIRST WITH SOME WARM CLOTHING AND THEN WITH THIN SHEET BRASS KEPT CLEAN AND BRIGHT THE EXPENCE OF THIS COVERING WOULD I AM CONFIDENT BE AMPLY REPAID BY THE SAVING OF HEAT AND FUEL WHICH WOULD RESULT FRONT IT IF GARDEN WALLS PAINTED BLACK ACQUIRE HEAT FASTER WHEN EXPOSED TO THE SUNS DIRECT RAYS THAN WHEN THEY ARE NOT

IS BELOW THAT OF THE SURFACE OF THE SKI ANDI CWHEN THE BODY IS NOT EXPOSED TO THE ACTION OF CALORIFIC RAYS FROM OTHER SUBSTANCES AAXO80 COUNT RUMFORDS ENQUIRY CONCERNING THE NATURE OF HEAT IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT THE WARMTH OF CLOTHING DEPENDS MUCH ON THE POLISH OF THE SURFACE OF THE SUBSTANCE OF WHICH IT IS MADE AND HENCE WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT IN CHOOSING THE COLOUR OF OUR WINTER GARMENTS THOSE DYES SHOULD BE AVOIDED WHICH TEND MOST TO DESTROY THAT POLISH AND AS A WHITE SURFACE REFLECTS MORE LIGHT THAN AN EQUAL SURFACE EQUALLY POLISHED OF ANY OTHER COLOUR THERE IS MUCH REASON TO THINK THAT WHITE GARMENTS ARE WARMER THAN ANY OTHER IN COLD WEATHER THEY ARE UNIVERSALLY CONSIDERED AS THE COOLEST THAT CAN BE WORN IN VERY HOT WEATHER AND ESPECIALLY WHEN A PERSON IS EXPOSED TO THE DIRECT RAYS OF THE SUN AND IF THEY ARE WELL CALCULATED TO REFLECT CALO RIFIC RAYS IN SUMMER THEY MUST BE EQUALLY WELL CALCULATED TO REFLECT THOSE FRIGORIFIC RAYS BY WHICH WE ARE COOLED AND ANNOYED IN WINTER I HAVE FOUND BY DIRECT AND DECISIVE EXPERIMENTS OF WHICH AN ACCOUNT WILL HEREAFTER BE GIVEN TO THIS SOCIETY THAT GARMENTS OF FUR ARE MUCH WARMER IN COLD WEATHER WHEN WORN WITH THE FUR OR HAIR OUTWARDS THAN WHEN IT IS TURNED INWARDS IS NOT THIS A PROOF THAT WE ARE KEPT WARM BY OUR CLOTHING NOT SO MUCH BY CONFINING OUR HEAT AS BY KEEPING OFF THOSE FRIGORIFIC RAYS WHICH TEND TO COOL US THE FINE FUR OF BEASTS BEING A HIGHLY POLISHED SUBSTANCE IS WELL CALCULATED TO REFLECT THOSE RAYS WHICH FALL ON IT AND IF THE BODY WERE KEPT WARM BY THE RAYS WHICH PROCEED FROM IT BEING REFLECTED BACK UPON IT THERE IS REASON TO THINK THAT A FUR GARMENT WOULD BE WARMEST WHEN WORN WITH THE HAIR IN WARDS BUT IF IT BE BY REFLECTING AND TURNING AWAY THE FRIGORIFIC RAYS FROM EXTERNAL COLDER BODIES THAT WVE ARE KEPT WARM BY OUR CLOTHES IN COLD WEATHER WE MIGHT NATURALLY EXPECT THATWND THE MODE OF ITS GOMMUNICATION AGO PELLISSE WOULD BE WARMEST WHEN WORN WITH THE HAIR OUTWVARDS AS I HAVE FOUND IT TO BE IN FACT THE POINT HERE IN QUESTION IS BY NO IMEAIS A MATTER OF SMALL IMPORTANCE FOR UNTIL THE PRINCIPLES OF THE WARIMTH OF CLOTHING BE UNDERSTOOD WE SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE OUR MEASURES WITH CERTAINTY AND WITH THE LEAST POSSIBLE TROUBLE AND EXPENCE FOR DEFENDING OURSELVES AGAINST THE INCLEMENACIES OF THE SEASONS AND MAKING OURSELVES COMFORTABLE IN ALL CLIMATES THE FUR OF SEVERAL DELICATE ANIMALS BECOMES WHITE IN

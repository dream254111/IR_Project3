j100000,Science,1624033,Further Considerations on the Systematic Position of Tarsius,i295444,SCIENCE are illusions of some sort Their general char acter is what would be shown if the adjusting screws of an objective were set up too tightly producing a set of strains in the glass or if the objective were strained by its cell Strains of this sort will sometimes produce faint com panions to stars sufficiently bright A com parison of all the drawings of Venus available in the library of the Lick Observatory is very instructive All observers except those at Flagstaff see faint markings of one class while those drawn by Mr Lowell are of a totally dif ferent nature Venus has been observed on very many oc casions at Mt Hamilton with our essentially perfect twelveinch objectglass in the years 18881897 without once seeing markings of the kind drawn by Mr Lowell or distinct mark ings of any kind Faint and indistinct mark ings of the character of those drawn by scores of observers for a century past are however seen when the circumstances are good The foregoing notes seem to me to throw doubt on the reality of the markings reported from the Flagstaff Observatory Until Mr Lowells observations are fully comfirmed by other observers with other telescopes it will be wise not to accept them unreservedly EDWARD S HOLDEN MT HAMILTON March 9 1897 FURTHER CONSIDERATIONS ON THE SYSTEMATIC POSITION OF TARSIUS PROFESSOR HUBRECHT has replied with some warmth to the paper I lately published in SCIENCE in which I attempted to show that in my opinion Tarsius is more of a lemur than an ape although in reality an annectant type between the two The objection I raised to placing Tarsius among the apes and the effect of this transferral on the classification of the Primates based on their osteology re lated to recent forms Professor Hubrecht is probably quite aware that when we introduce the fossil Primates into the question of classify ing the recent forms the apparently sharp lines of demarcation between the skeletons of recent lemurs and apes disappear Six or more radial rays thicker at the outer rim of the image of the planet I entirely agree with Professor Hubrecht in the idea that classification should be based as far as possible on phylogeny and that the only truly scientific arrangement of animals depends upon a knowledge of their whole or ganization both embryonic and adult I claim however that the paleontological method in determining phylogeny is more nearly accurate than the embryological as in the latter many characters are lost and innumerable csenogenetic variations are introduced which the embryolo gists often cannot distinguish from real homo genetic structures The great number of phy logenetic trees based on embryology which are annually cut down is amazing and in fact the truth of the theory of recapitulation as applied to the embryonic stages is now somewhat ques tioned I do not at all regret quoting the name of Francis Maitland Balfour in regard to his warn ing against placing too much reliance on pla cental arrangements as criteria for the classifi cation of the Mammalia and hold that it applies directly to the question of the systematic posi tion of Tarsius On this side of the Atlantic we do not all follow the NeoDarwinians in believing that the germinal products are locked up in iron safes as it were and not affected by external conditions as the rest of the organism I will now sum up my principal reasons for not accepting Professor Hubrechts views that Tarsius is only related among the Primates to the Anthropoids 1 It has not been shown as yet that the placenta in the lemurs is not a derivative of the chorion as in the apes M A MilneEdwards remarks Or lallan toide des Indrisines est si facile A detacher des parties adjacentes quil me semble pen probable quil ait laiss6 un de ses feuillets adh6rent au chorion et il y a tout lieu de penser que lexplication m6canique de la production

externe du chorion provoque une hypertrophie dans les parties correspondantes du tissu de cette en vellope feetal et que cest de cette mani6re que se forme le placenta et non A la suite de laccolement dune portion des parois de la vesicule allantoidi enne Mammiferes de Madagascar p 284 APRIL 23 1897658 SCIENCE 2 The diffuse stage of the placenta of some of the anthropoids is apparently directly com parable to that of the lemurs 3 There is no fundamental distinction be tween a large free allantois and one which is rudimentary it is merely a matter of degree and not one of kind 4 There is no paleontological evidence as yet deduced which proves that apes and lemurs have arisen independently and that these two phyla were distinct as early as the Meso zoic 5 The Santa Cruz beds of Patagonia in which lIomunculus occurs are probably as late as the Lower Miocene 6 Anaptomorphus of the Lower Eocene is much more closely related to the lemurs than to the apes but it has certain anthropoid characters which indicate that some of the latter may have been derived from this genus 7 Our present paleontological knowledge indicates that the Old World apes have been derived from a lemurine stock as late as the Oligocene 8 Synthetic types as Adapis Tarsius and Mesopithecus demonstrate that apes and lemurs are genetically related It remains to be seen whether naturalists in general will be willing to accept Professor Hu brechts views as to the systematic position of Tarsius depending upon the connection of placenta with the embryo bauchstiel and also on the histological details of the former It seems probable that in forming an opinion as to the affinities of any animal the only judicious course to pursue is to consider the whole organ ization as well as the development As far as I can learn from Professor Hubrechts paper he has not followed this method but wishes us to accept his conclusions hardly referring to the structures of Tarsius which are iden tical with those of the lemurs and which occur in no other mammalian group except the lemurs In conclusion I would like to call Professor Hubrechts attention to the following passage from Burmeisters Monograph which shows that he considered Tarsius to be a lemur al though Professor Hubrecht does not mention this fact in his memoir Aber Tarsius ist N S VOL V No 121 nicht mal ein Affe er ist vielmehr nur ein Halbaffe ein Mitglied jener Gruppe     Darin unterscheidet er sich von allen iibrigen Halbaffen und steht eben desshalb so isolirt unter ihnen da It would be of interest if other morphologists would enter into this dis cussion and give their opinions as to the sys tematic position of Tarsius If I did not state Professor Hubrechts case thoroughly it was an oversight on my part CHARLES EARLE NEW ROCHELLE NEW YORK April 7 1897 THE COMING ICE AGE TO THE EDITOR OF SCIENCE In SCIENCE Of March 19th Professor G Frederick Wright in hisnotice of the Coming Ice Age says that he is not sure that he has comprehended the au thors meaning And it seems that such is the case where he writes that the theory of the author is that a land conection between Patagonia and the Antarctic Continent or a great diminution of the channel between these lands would produce an effect upon the ocean currents favorable to the glaciation of both hemispheres This description is so inade quate that it may produce a wrong impression and so prevent a clear apprehension of what follows in the review One of the main objects of my explanations has been to show that the closing or diminution of the channel south of Cape Horn would cause the tropical currents to enter the southern seas in sufficient volume to cause an age of mildness in the high southern latitudes which would spread over the globe and the warm climate would continue until the southern oceans through a slow process re tained water sufficient to greatly enlarge the channel south of Cape Horn and so cause con ditions favorable for the glaciation of lands situated in the high southern latitudes such as is being performed today Consequently my prognostication of a coming ice age is based on the present enlarged condition of the Cape Horn channel which affords sufficient space for the strong prevailing westerly winds of that latitude to force the surface waters of the southern oceans through the wide channel and so onward around the globe Therefore the

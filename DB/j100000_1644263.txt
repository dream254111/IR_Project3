letters might publish a note of appreciation of the life and work of this savantthe last of the illustrious trio of paleobotanist Renault Zeiller GrandEurywho made the French Carboniferous and Permian floras classic and a standard for the whole world Francois Cyrille GrandEury was born at Houdreville Meurthe on March 9 1839 He N S VOL XLVII No 1203 was a mining engineer by profession and early in his career he became interested in the fos sil plants of the Carboniferous publishing a paper on the St Etienne flora as early as 1869 His large work on the Loire flora a folio monograph of 624 pages and 27 plates was published as a memoir of the French Academy in 1877 and is one of the most comprehensive works of its kind ever printed The only other large systematic work from his pen was that on the geology and paleontology of the coalfield of the Gard published in 1890 GrandEury was always much interested in the stratigraphic applications of his subject in the conditions of growth of the coal plants and the origin of coalsubjects upon which he repeatedly published He may be said to have established the chronologic succession of floras for the coal seams of the Stephanian named from the typical development of this stage at St tienne Probably no other Stu dent of Carboniferous floras had so thorough a field experience or saw one tenth the amount of material in place in the rocks as did GrandEury Consequently his observa tions on the habit sizes and positions of growth of the various Cordaites Lepidophytes and Calamites are especially trustworthy His name is inseparably associated with the elucidation of the habit and morphology of Cordaites and his restorations of these and other coal plants are to be found in every textbook He published a memoir upon the formation of coal in the Annales des Mines in 1882 a subject to which he returned in his paper be fore the International Geological Congress in 1901 and in his last large work commenced in 1912 He was not a voluminous writer and with the exception of his work on the Oar boniferous plants of the Spanrish peninsula embodied in lists of species all of his work was centered on the French floras Nor did he so far as I know publish anything in the fields of Mesozoic and Cenozoic paleobotany unless his paper of 1902 on the formation of stipite brown coal and lignite can be so con sidered He did however

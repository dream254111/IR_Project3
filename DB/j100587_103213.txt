ad mortuos se adplicaret it being from Them their Writings and other Remains that the greatest part of Knowledge is derived to us and what the Living fur nish us with is chiefly taken from the Monuments of the Dead Inscriptions are in this kind most valuable as being for the generality Originals of undoubted Veracity not subject to the Errors of Copying The Inscription here publishd is of the greater value for that it is the on ly one as yet discoverd any way relating to the British Belgae You have Tab VII the Inscription with the Figure of the Stone as it was dug up near Bath 1708 and is now to be seen set up in a Wall at the East end of the Church in the Abby Green Tab VII I read it thus at length according to our Modern way of writing Latin Julius Vitalis Fabricensis Legionis

Inscription divides his Explication of it into Ten Sections which have the following Titles S E C T I Legionum Fabricenses Fabricenses sub pri mis duntaxat Imperatoribus II Alij Fabricenses hi a

Nationis nomine Patria designatur Julij Vitalis quae in Belgarum territorio fuerit non Gallicorum sed Britannicorum X Ad honorem Julij Vitalis faciuni quae de co in hoc monumento dicuntur To this Explication of Julius Vitalis his Epitaph the same learned Gentleman adds two other Inscriptions one found not long since at Pozzuoli the other at Baiae with Explications of them After a Letter of Compliment to Dr Nicholes late Warden of Winchester College the Editor produces his Commentary on Julius Vitalis his Epitaph They are both divided into Sections in the following Order Sect I I V L I V S V I T A L I S These Names are enquired into and Instances given of many Persons having this Sirname and of those some of Quality now living in Italy Sect II F A B R I C I E S I S It is here observed that the Romans for the sake of easy Pronunciation used sometimes to interpose an I and omit N That they being great Masters of the Art Military had duum generum Officinas Armorum qua rum hae Legionariae illae Opidanae erant The sormer came at last to be calld Fabricae as appears from Hyginus al lowing in every Camp for three Regions room for a Fabrica Vide Antiq Rom a Cl Graevio edit Vol X From Fabrica comes Fabricenses which is read in the Theodosian Code in a Law made Leontio  Sallustio Coss A D 344 And because the Author has not met with this Word earlier than this Year He does not place J Vitalis much above this time Sect IIIinferredinferred286 Sect III L E G XX The Author here delivers it as probable That this was one of Antonyes Legions which amounted without Interruption to the Number XXV inclusive The In signia for the first Cohort of this Legion and two such as belong to the other Cohorts are from a Coyn of Ur sinus here represented in a Cut Under this head it is affirmed That there were seve ral Vicesimae Legiones but how many is uncertain The several Names of this Legion as they lye scatterd up and down in Authors are recited A short History of it producd particularly of its coming into Britain un der Plautius about the Year 43 That Invasion one of the most remarkable Epochai that ever concerned this Island Graecina Wife to Plautius probably the first Christian in Britain This Legion was in the last Battel with and overthrow of Boadicia Was under the Com mand of Roscius Caelius and after that of Agricola Had its chief Station at Deva Chester which had its Increase if not its Rise from this Legion about the Year 80 Near the River Deva He thinks the Cangi were seated and proves That they were overcome by Agricola in the first Year of Domitians Reign This Legion in Bri tain in the Reign of Adrian The Vexillarii of this Le gion built part of that Wall between Dunbritton and Edenborough Friths Ptolemy and the Itinerary of Anto ninus mention this Legion as settled at Deva Chester It was there in the time of Commodus and at Crowdun  dalewaith It sided with Carausius against Maximinian and Diocletian The Romans did often place Coyns under their Altars and other Buildings Of the XXth Legion part had their Station at Bath and was there about the middle of the 4th Century This Legion continued in Britain about three hundred Years con sequently287 sequently must be of great use in communicating to the Britains the many Arts and Sciences they learnt of the Romans Sect IV V V Tho Learned Men agree That the latter V signifies Victrix an Epithet common to this with several other Legions there is among them much controversy what it meant by the former V some reading it Valens others Valeria others Valeriana The Author is of the latter Opinion urging That as the Legion called by Dio  is by Tacitus more than once termd Claudiana Legio so this Legion termd by Dio  ought in his Opinion to be in Latin rendred Legio Valeriana Especially if we consider That the word Legio affects to be joined with an Adjective ending in ana of which He produces almost twenty Examples and can produce many more On the other hand it does not appear to him That Legio is in any good Author joyned with the word Valeria He farther adds That tho it be undoubt edly true there was a Legion calld Valens Victrix for this is evident from an Inscription reported by Lipsius and others yet there is no proof That any Legion ha ving that Name was ever in Britain He enquires how this Legion came to be calld Valeriana and how Vi ctrix And says there is a longer Account of this Le gion than perhaps of any other viz up to 374 Years Sect V S T I P E N D I O R U M IX The yearly Stipends are here placed to express the Years of Service and shew That J V served nine Years in the Army Sect VI288 Sect VI A NN O R XXXIX This double N is very remarkable rarely if at all to be met with in any other Inscription The last Line in the Ligature is raised higher than ordinary perhaps to include for softness of Pronounciation an I and then the Word is to be read Anniorum There are many Instances of this kind to be met with in ancient MSS and Inscriptions Julius Vitalis enterd into the Service in the Twentieth Year of his Age though the Romans gene rally listed at Seventeen and sometimes earlier Coyns are mentioned as proving Cifres to be of use among the Romans Sect VII N A T I O N E The first Vowel here without a Line transverse is accoridng to Mr Cambdens Rule a good Argument to prove this Inscription not to be more ancient than Se veruss Age There being as that Learned Antiquary affirms no such Form of this Letter in this Island before that time Sect VIII B E L G A The Belgae came out of Germany and settled in Gaul from whence a part of them invaded Britain about the Time of Diviaticus They landed in or near the Bay of Clausentum old Southhampton and possest the SeaCoast of Hampshire as it is now calld Thence they marchd to Venta Winchester and gave it the Name of Venta Belgarum and extended their Conquests farther into the Countreys now known by the Names of Wiltshire and Somerset The289 The Cangi could not inhabit any part of this Belgium as some learned Men have formerly affirmed and others of late undertaken to prove for the Leaden Pigs in number twenty found some time since in Cheshire each having the following Inscription IMP DOMIT AVG GER DE CEANG That is Imperator Domitianus Augustus Germanicus de Ceangis sive inferredCangisinferred These Laminae Plumbeae do I say evidently prove the Victory of the Cangi to have been near the River Deva where in all likelihood they were seated Tis farther manifest from Ptolemey they could not at least in his time and according to his Geography inha bit any part of Belgium and this by an undeniable Ar gument The Maritime Belgians near the Isle of Wight were overcome by Vespasian whose Camp now to be seen near Chichester was capable of three Legions that is Thirty six thousand Men Vitalis a Citizen of Rome by virtue of Caracallas Constitution if no other way The Britains were some times calld Romans Vespasian never overcame the Dun monij Sect VIIII EX

The Ar mamentarium at the Mouth of the old Rhine very an cient Its Communication in latter Times with our Fabrica Not unlikely but that the Legionary Fabri censes were incorporated into the

Mosaic Pavements Of which one is here described Vitalis seems to have been Praefectus Fabricen sium from the Honour done Him by the whole College in his Funeral and Monument Sect X E L A T U S The true Signification of this Word in opposition to Sipontinus Collegium in the purest Latin Authors never signifies a Place Sect XI H S E The Rise of Notes Singulae or Siglae No Points in this Note being of itself easily understood The common way of Deciphering not difficult and may be per formd by one who understands not the Language of the Writing A way of writing proposed so occult as not to be discovered No Digamma AEolicum in any of the British Inscriptions Phrases as well as Words have291 have their Rise and Fall This of Hic situs est one of the most ancient The Military Ways as now seen are some of the most Magnificent Remains of the Roman Greatness begun near Bath under Claudius The Roman Army in Britain under Nero 70000 which after the De feat of Boadicia was in all likelihood employd in public Works as Ways c At Bath four Military Ways meet in this Quadrivium about a Mile out of the Town near the LondonRoad was a famous Burying  Place in which Julius Vitalis and several others were buryed BuryingPlaces most proper remote from Cities and therefore recommended to more frequent use after the Example of most wise Nations In the last Chapter the Author treats of the Ortho graphy Ornaments and other Accidents of this Inscrip tion setting forth in particular That as Inscriptions best of all teach Orthography so they are often most faulty in this respect Points at first were used to di stinguish Words In this Inscription they are where most perfect Triangular and placed near the middle of the preceding Letter The Roman V was pronouncd like our W consequently Julius Witalis This Vowel was sometimes pointed beneath sometimes Archd as appears from MSS of a thousand Years age now to be seen in the Bodleian Library contrary to the Opinion of Cellarius who affirms That the round inferredbottomdinferred U U is not above a hundred Years standing This last Figure of this Letter taken from the Runer as the other V was from the Greck T Of the mixing small with great Letters and mixing in the same inferredWritinginferred Letters of divers Alphabets Lithotomists careless in dividing Syllables Knowledge of the Antients best preserved by Inscriptions which yet labour

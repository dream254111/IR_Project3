PLACE J VITALIS MUCH ABOVE THIS TIME SECT IIIINFERREDINFERRED286 SECT III L E G XX THE AUTHOR HERE DELIVERS IT AS PROBABLE THAT THIS WAS ONE OF ANTONYES LEGIONS WHICH AMOUNTED WITHOUT INTERRUPTION TO THE NUMBER XXV INCLUSIVE THE IN SIGNIA FOR THE FIRST COHORT OF THIS LEGION AND TWO SUCH AS BELONG TO THE OTHER COHORTS ARE FROM A COYN OF UR SINUS HERE REPRESENTED IN A CUT UNDER THIS HEAD IT IS AFFIRMED THAT THERE WERE SEVE RAL VICESIMAE LEGIONES BUT HOW MANY IS UNCERTAIN THE SEVERAL NAMES OF THIS LEGION AS THEY LYE SCATTERD UP AND DOWN IN AUTHORS ARE RECITED A SHORT HISTORY OF IT PRODUCD PARTICULARLY OF ITS COMING INTO BRITAIN UN DER PLAUTIUS ABOUT THE YEAR 43 THAT INVASION ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE EPOCHAI THAT EVER CONCERNED THIS ISLAND GRAECINA WIFE TO PLAUTIUS PROBABLY THE FIRST CHRISTIAN IN BRITAIN THIS LEGION WAS IN THE LAST BATTEL WITH AND OVERTHROW OF BOADICIA WAS UNDER THE COM MAND OF ROSCIUS CAELIUS AND AFTER THAT OF AGRICOLA HAD ITS CHIEF STATION AT DEVA CHESTER WHICH HAD ITS INCREASE IF NOT ITS RISE FROM THIS LEGION ABOUT THE YEAR 80 NEAR THE RIVER DEVA HE THINKS THE CANGI WERE SEATED AND PROVES THAT THEY WERE OVERCOME BY AGRICOLA IN THE FIRST YEAR OF DOMITIANS REIGN THIS LEGION IN BRI TAIN IN THE REIGN OF ADRIAN THE VEXILLARII OF THIS LE GION BUILT PART OF THAT WALL BETWEEN DUNBRITTON AND EDENBOROUGH FRITHS PTOLEMY AND THE ITINERARY OF ANTO NINUS MENTION THIS LEGION AS SETTLED AT DEVA CHESTER IT WAS THERE IN THE TIME OF COMMODUS AND AT CROWDUN  DALEWAITH IT SIDED WITH CARAUSIUS AGAINST MAXIMINIAN AND DIOCLETIAN THE ROMANS DID OFTEN PLACE COYNS UNDER THEIR ALTARS AND OTHER BUILDINGS OF THE XXTH LEGION PART HAD THEIR STATION AT BATH AND WAS THERE ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE 4TH CENTURY THIS LEGION CONTINUED IN BRITAIN ABOUT THREE HUNDRED YEARS CON SEQUENTLY287 SEQUENTLY MUST BE OF GREAT USE IN COMMUNICATING TO THE BRITAINS THE MANY ARTS AND SCIENCES THEY LEARNT OF THE ROMANS SECT IV V V THO LEARNED MEN AGREE THAT THE LATTER V SIGNIFIES VICTRIX AN EPITHET COMMON TO THIS WITH SEVERAL OTHER LEGIONS THERE IS AMONG THEM MUCH CONTROVERSY WHAT IT MEANT BY THE FORMER V SOME READING IT VALENS OTHERS VALERIA OTHERS VALERIANA THE AUTHOR IS OF THE LATTER OPINION URGING THAT AS THE LEGION CALLED BY DIO  IS BY TACITUS MORE THAN ONCE TERMD CLAUDIANA LEGIO SO THIS LEGION TERMD BY DIO  OUGHT IN HIS OPINION TO BE IN LATIN RENDRED LEGIO VALERIANA ESPECIALLY IF WE CONSIDER THAT THE WORD LEGIO AFFECTS TO BE JOINED WITH AN ADJECTIVE ENDING IN ANA OF WHICH HE PRODUCES ALMOST TWENTY EXAMPLES AND CAN PRODUCE MANY MORE ON THE OTHER HAND IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO HIM THAT LEGIO IS IN ANY GOOD AUTHOR JOYNED WITH THE WORD VALERIA HE FARTHER ADDS THAT THO IT BE UNDOUBT EDLY TRUE THERE WAS A LEGION CALLD VALENS VICTRIX FOR THIS IS EVIDENT FROM AN INSCRIPTION REPORTED BY LIPSIUS AND OTHERS YET THERE IS NO PROOF THAT ANY LEGION HA VING THAT NAME WAS EVER IN BRITAIN HE ENQUIRES HOW THIS LEGION CAME TO BE CALLD VALERIANA AND HOW VI CTRIX AND SAYS THERE IS A LONGER ACCOUNT OF THIS LE GION THAN PERHAPS OF ANY OTHER VIZ UP TO 374 YEARS SECT V S T I P E N D I O R U M IX THE YEARLY STIPENDS ARE HERE PLACED TO EXPRESS THE YEARS OF SERVICE AND SHEW THAT J V SERVED NINE YEARS IN THE ARMY SECT VI288 SECT VI A NN O R XXXIX THIS DOUBLE N IS VERY REMARKABLE RARELY IF AT ALL TO BE MET WITH IN ANY OTHER INSCRIPTION THE LAST LINE IN THE LIGATURE IS RAISED HIGHER THAN ORDINARY PERHAPS TO INCLUDE FOR SOFTNESS OF PRONOUNCIATION AN I AND THEN THE WORD IS TO BE READ ANNIORUM THERE ARE MANY INSTANCES OF THIS KIND TO BE MET WITH IN ANCIENT MSS AND INSCRIPTIONS JULIUS VITALIS ENTERD INTO THE SERVICE IN THE TWENTIETH YEAR OF HIS AGE THOUGH THE ROMANS GENE RALLY LISTED AT SEVENTEEN AND SOMETIMES EARLIER COYNS ARE MENTIONED AS PROVING CIFRES TO BE OF USE AMONG THE ROMANS SECT VII N A T I O N E THE FIRST VOWEL HERE WITHOUT A LINE TRANSVERSE IS ACCORIDNG TO MR CAMBDENS RULE A GOOD ARGUMENT TO PROVE THIS INSCRIPTION NOT TO BE MORE ANCIENT THAN SE VERUSS AGE THERE BEING AS THAT LEARNED ANTIQUARY AFFIRMS NO SUCH FORM OF THIS LETTER IN THIS ISLAND BEFORE THAT TIME SECT VIII B E L G A THE BELGAE CAME OUT OF GERMANY AND SETTLED IN GAUL FROM WHENCE

BELGIUM AND THIS BY AN UNDENIABLE AR GUMENT THE MARITIME BELGIANS NEAR THE ISLE OF WIGHT WERE OVERCOME BY VESPASIAN WHOSE CAMP NOW TO BE SEEN NEAR CHICHESTER WAS CAPABLE OF THREE LEGIONS THAT IS

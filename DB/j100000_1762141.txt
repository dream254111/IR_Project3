Mascart insulators and the necessary adjuncts As the thunderclouds approach the electrometerneedle becomes very ac tive and after considerable oscillation begins to move steadily in one direction generally negative until a deflection indicating for example a potential of three thousand volts is reached when simultane ous with a flash of lightning occurs a quick drop to zero to begin again slowly to increase and then more rapidly until the next flash of lightning So perfect is this correspondence that the lightning can be timed as accurately from the indications of the electrometer as by direct vision If at this time a finger be held out towards the collector sparks are given with the accompanying crackling and hissing and the tingling sensation in the finger In such a case the observer is simply grounding the insulated charged collector The greatest sparking distance in our experience thus far as determined by direct measurement was a little under four millimetres I have never found any difference as one of your correspondents intimates in the sparking distance depending on the finger The potential of the air however as shown by the electrometer readings is constantly fluctuating often very rapidly and at certain times the potential of the air is zero Of course a finger presented at such a time fails to draw a spark To imitate more closely the conditions of the mountainside the previous arrangement was re versed and the observer insulated by standing on a Navajo blanket folded several times This is but poor insulation though it answered the purpose Standing close to the open window of the monument the results were as anticipated My hair stood on end and on presenting a knuckle to the iron frame work a spark passed I should remark that these effects were only experienced during a thunder storm I tried the experiment at other times with out success There are two further points of interest to which attention is called Professor LeConte has instanced Science ix No 205 the case of the survey party on one of the San Juan mountains where  a sudden ces sation of the distressing electrical effects was experi enced whenever there occurred a flash of lightning This is confirmed by what precedes and our elec trometer readings make it certain that every light ningflash relieves the electrical tension and gives us also the means of estimiating the electromotive force producing the disruptive discharge and the electric strength of the air under natural conditions The second point of interest is the effect of electrifica tion upon the waterparticles present Lord Rayleigh has shown how the character and direction of a fine stream of water may be altered by electrical in fluences for example a stick of sealingwax when rubbed distorting a fine jet of water Effects of the same character I noticed in the jet of water issuing from the nozzle of the collector When the collector was  grounded the stream would preserve a certain even rounded character breaking into drops some four inches away from the place of issue Remov ing the ground connection the stream would twist and split into sprays with the increasing electrifica tion Simultaneous with a flash of lightning this distortion ceased and for the moment the stream resumed its first character only to be again distorted NCE VoL IX No 226 and repeat the same operation with the next light ningflash ALEXANDER McADIE Cambridge May 25 Railway jubilee Paris I887 I am requested by the executive committee in Paris to ask the favor of appealing through your columns for the loan of any objects books medals drawings etc relating to the history of railways and means of transportation generally both ancient and modern in this country I am directed also to say that all expenses of forwarding and returning the same to the lenders packing and unpacking will be defrayed by the ex ecutive that each object will be insured for the value the lender may put upon it and that special attendants will be told off for their safe custody All communications on the subject may be ad dressed to M G Senechal 8 Faubourg Montmartre Paris or to Mr George L Fowler ME of New York City commissioner in charge for the United States Palais de 1Exposition Bois de Vincennes Paris France By addressing communications direct to Paris much valuable time will be saved JOHN W WESTON Chicago Ill May 23 The maxillopalatines of Tachycineta With respect to what your correspondent says in regard to a drawing of mine I can only say that the skull of T thalassina from which it was made is a perfect one and my copy correct in all particulars This is more than I can say for the reproduction of it Science No 223 fig 1 but however this may be it at least affords me now the opportunity to yield gracefully to my critic for I am free to confess that the maxillopalatines of that skull are  im perfect  and  broken off  on paper  by Mr F A Lucas as any one may see who cares to compare my drawing in the Proceedings of the Zoological society of London Dec 1 1885 p 899 fig F with his copy of it in Science to which I refer above R W SHUFELDT Fort Wingate NMex May 20 No parietal foramen in Tritylodon Dr George Baur of the Peabody museum New Haven has been recently studying the fossil verte brates in the British museum of natural history At my request he has kindly made a careful study of the skull of Tritylodon and finds that Professor Owens observation of a foramen between the parie tal bones is incorrect He writes London May 8 Ich habe Tritylodon hier genau untersucht ein ParietalForamen existirt nicht es ist wenigstens keine Spur desselben nachweisbar This contra dicts without question the suggestion I made in a recent number of Science upon the strength of Pro fessor Owens observation that there was probably a pineal eye of considerable size in Tritylodon I hasten to make the correction before the suggestion goes any further Although it has proved incorrect I think any one who will examine Professor Owens figure and description of the Tritylodon skull Quart journ geol soc 1884 will admit that there was suf ficient ground for this conjecture HENRY F OSBORN

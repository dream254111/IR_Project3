the tribes found there resident by the first ex plorers He presents the question temper ately and free from the fantastic notions which one generally anticipates in this in vestigation His results may be briefly stated Beginning with the  mound builders lie points out numerous reasons for consider ing them the immediate ancestors of the present Indians going further into their identification lie decides that the ancestors of the Cherokees were the mound builders of the Ohio Valley The original seat of the HuronIroquois family he locates north of the Great Lakes and that of the Algon quian family somewhere to the south of Hudsons Bay where the Crees are still found speaking a pure and ancient dialect These two mighty stocks moved slowly southward driving the mound builders from thle Ohio and penetrating into Vir ginia There they met the Dakotas whom they destroyed except the small tribes of the Tuteloes and Catawbas The Gulf States were peopled by the Muskoghean tribes from the southwest The debated question whether there was a rougli stone or palaolithic age in the United States he answers from the evidence before him in the negative GALTONS METHOD OF ISOGENS MiR GALTON is fertile in the application of new methods to anthropologic data In a recent article in the Journal of Statistics he applies the method in use among meteorolo gists to define lines of equal barometric pressure to data of natality His socalled isogens  are analogous to the isobars of the weather maps They are lines of equal birthrate forming a constant derived from the two variables the age of the father and that of tle mother 257 By this ingenious and simple process he reaches some curious results One is the unexpected law of natality That the sums of the ages of the parents are con stant in other words that the birthrate is determined by the joint ages of the father and mother The difference between the ages of the two parents is of no account whatever in ninetenths of the total num ber of marriages Only in the obvious case where the wife is older than the hus band and is approaching the limit of the childbearing age is this law at fault An other odd fact developed by this method is that a woman approaching somewhat closely the limit of the childbearing age say about thirtyfive or thirtyeight is more fertile with a man of her own age than with one who is younger though it is admitted cer tain social reasons may help to this result Like all of Mr Galtons articles this one will be found admirably presented and well worth study D G BRINTON UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA CURRENT NOTES ON PHYSIOGRAPHY I SIXTH INTERNATIONAL GEOGRAPHICAL CONGRESS THE Sixth International Geographical Congress is to be held in London from July 26th to August 3d 1895 under the auspi ces of the Royal Geographical Society An invitation circular has lately been issued stating the general plan of the Congress the conditions under which tickets of mem bership can be obtained the program of subjects for discussion and a most compre hensive list of honorary fficers honorary general committeemen and committees in charge of various divisions of the subject proposed for discussion An extended ex hibit of geographical materials will be held in connection with the Congress which altogether promises to be a most attractive reunion The invitation circular can be MARCH 8 1895258 SCIENCE had from the Secretary Royal Geographical Society 1 Saville Row London AM A representative American attendance is highly desirable NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MONOGRAPHS A RECENT number of the  National Geo graphical MIagazine as well as a circular distributed by the American Book Co New York announces the early preparation of a series of geographical essays under the above title prepared by various experts and addressed particularly to the public school teachers of this country The intention of this series of monographs is to present ac curate and properly correlated informa tion upon the geography of our country in simple untechnical language and with good illustrations in such form that it may be practically useful in supplement ing the ordinary teaching of physical geo graphy They are to help supply the teach er with that background of knowledge that is so essential to good teaching They will not replace any existing text books but in time as the number of mono graphs increases they will certainly be free ly drawn on by textbook makers They deserve prominent mention in SCIENCE for although reduced to as simple form as pos sible the names of the authors announced are a guarantee that the monographs will be essentially scientific in character Their appearance will be watched for with inter 2st GEOGRAPHICAL PRIZES THE National Geographic Society an nounces as a subject for a competitive prize essay in 1895  The River Systems of the United States The essays must not ex ceed two thousand words in length and will be received only fiom those public schools whose intention to compete is an nounced not later than ay 1895 The es saysmust be composed entirely by scholars They must be written by the end of the N S VoL I No10 school year 189495 and submitted to the Society not later than July 15th next The geographical gold medal of the Society will be awarded to the best essayist of the country the second best will receive a cer tificate of honorable mention The best es sayist of each State will receive a certificate of proficiency from the committee on awards This committee consists of General A WT Greely Professor T H Mendenhall and Superintendent WT B Powell Further in formation concerning the competition may be had from the Society by addressing its Secretary in Washington D C NEWELLS REPORT ON AGRICULTURE BY IRRIGATION IMcH physiographic material is gathered in the harvest fields of other subjects A good opportunity for physiographic glean ing is Newells Report on agriculture by irrigation in the western part of the United States at the eleventh census 1890 re cently issued In California where irriga tion has attained greater importance than in any other State the advantageous ar rangement of the canals and ditches is in many cases peculiarly dependent on the aggraded alluvial fans that the streams from the Sierra have so often built out from their canyons on emerging upon the open valley plain The fans of Kings and Kern rivers are the best illustrations given of this kind The abrupt slopes of the San Bernardino mountains in the southern part of the State are cut by deep narrow valleys from which the waste is strewn ingreat al luvial fans of unusual height and iadius Newell shows these to be of much impor tance in their relation to agriculture but as if to illustrate the backward condition of geographical terminology and the slow penetration that the few terms already in vented make among practical engineers he calls these wellformed fans by the vague term great masses The debris conSCIENCE sisting of sand gravel and bowlders lias been piled in great masses at the points where the streams enter upon the lower plains If it were not forthe earlier ac count of these huge fans by Hilgard Bull Geol Soc Amer iii 1891 124 theycould hardly be recognized here  In Arizona we read that the irrigating streams are largely supplied by rains induced by the en forced ascent of the winds when tlhey en counter the precipitous and ragged fault scarp where the great plateaus rise out of the lower desert plains In Idaho a great expanse of dissectedcotuntry where the rivers have cut down deep valleys cannot be irrigated without expensive engineering operations but farther up the Snake River  where the streams have not yet succeeded in cutting tllrough the lava the river water can be distributed over the plain withi comparative ease Yet is a most ex pressive word for the geographer The whole report is full of suggestive examples for extract and quotation BAYS AND FIORDS REGARDED AS SUBMERGED VALLEYS EARLY writers generally ascribed bays and fiords to the destructive action of the isea or to local dislocation Esmark about 1826 was perhaps the first to ascribe much importance to ice as an agent in making the Norwegian fiords a suggestioin that was afterward carried to an extravagant ex treme Dana on returning from the Vilkes expedition introduced the idea that fiords are drowned valleys  but whether the ero sion of the valleys was done by river work alone or more or less by glaciers must be determined by local study In the present view of the problem glacial erosion is almost by general consent reduced to a moderate measure it is chiefly the fiord basins that are now attributed to ice action while fiord valleys are regarded by nearly all observers as of preglacial origin as ordi 259 nary land valleys afterwards submerged Bays like Chesapeake and Narragansett are commonly regarded as resulting from the submergence of wide river valleys modi fied by glacial erosion or deposition if in glaciated regions This modern view is lately reenforced inan article by Professor ShalerEvidences as to change of sea level1 Bull Gebl Soc Amer vi 1885 141166 in which various reentrants of our coast such as Chesapeake and Narragansett bays the fiords of Maine and the numerous de pressions which break the northern part of the continent into a groupof islands are all ascribed wholly or chiefly to the submerg ence of streamworn lands The general problem of submergence seems however hlardly so simple as to indicate a progres sive subsidence of a somewhat uniform nature along the Atlantic coast from Mexico to near the pole The possibility of numer ous subordinate and discordant oscillations in different parts of the coast is wide open and while in a general way it may be said that our eastern coast has been depressed it does not follow that the depression was synchronous throughout as it must have been if its cause were a movement of the sea floor hence a preference for this hypo thesisof Strabo hardly seems warranted The submergence of our southern coast may now be going on while the northern coast may be at present rising but not risen enough to correct an earlier and greater sub mergence This would make diverse conti nental movements the essential cause and displacement of the sea floor only secondary GEOLOGIC ATLAS OF THE UNITED STATES ALTHOUGH primarily of geological inter est the several folios of this great atlas now issued are important to geographers from the accurate and succinct accounts that they give of topographical features The topo graphical sheets alone are very instructive but their value is greatly increased when MARCH 8 1895N S VOL I No 10 accompanied by explanations that have been prepared by trained observers who have been all over the ground examining the forms ofthe surface as the expressions of internal structures From the sheets in eastern Tennessee we may learn of the two peneplains that there give local illustration of widespread Appalachian forms On the Livingston sheet Montana there is a fine illustration of one of the many extinct lake basins now dlrained tlnrough a steepwalled gorge in a way so characteristic of the northern Rocky Mountains  With the Placerville sheet in the California Sierra the text tells of the reduction of the mountain belt to gentle slopes before the eruption of the great Neocene lava flows by which many of the older valleys were broadly filled and of the deep canyons cut by the displaced rivers since the mountain belt has been up heaved with a westward slant The plan of liberal distribution of these folios ensures that they will reach a wide variety of readers They will be welcomed by many workers students teachers and investiga tors geographers geologists and econo mists GEIKIES GREAT ICE AGE THE third edition of this important work has been lately issued New York Apple ton 1895 Although distinctly a geolog ical treatise not written from the geograph ical point of view it contains numerous pages of physiographic interest for many glacial deposits are so young as still to pre serve essentially their constructional form hence the account of moraines drumlins rockbasins and so on are of immediate geographical value The general subject of glacial erosion is hardly treated with the fulness that the many discussions it has given rise to would warrant and the ex planation of rockbasins does scanty justice to the opinions of many Swiss geologists who look on ice action as a secondary pro cess compared to a gentle warping of pre existent Valleys The extract from Wal laces paper defending the glacial excava tion of rockbasins would imply that that author was not acquainted with the numer ous lakes of dislocation in our western ter ritory For American readers the two chapters and the several maps by Cham berlin will prove attractive W M DAVIS HARVARD UNIVERSITY LABORATORY TEACHING OF LARGE CLASSESZOOLOGY IF the large and increasing attendance at our summer schools and the publication of many books and the reports made by those dealing in scientific apparatus can be taken as an index the amount of zoblogical teach ing is very rapidly increasing and the con duction of large classes is a problem of con siderable importance A class of college students numbering twenty or twentyfive and conducted by one officer is a large class and even with a favorably equipped laboratory is quite as large as a single teacher should attempt to carry Of course if a certain number of assistants can be engaged a largernumber of students can be directed though this is virtually the establishment of so many sub classes One of the first conditions for successful zoological instruction is that of immediate environment To crowd a score or more of katabolic youth into a small miserably lighted room and compel them to breathe the fumes of stale alcohol for two or three hours is to invite failure Each student should have a table to hlimself where there is good ligllt and where he feels a certain amount of proprietorship It should be so located that he is not tempted to carry on a clandestine parasitisni or even a symbiotic X A paper read

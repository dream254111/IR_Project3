change of screen so that each magnitude may show against its customary degree of color or brilliancy of back ground Such screens may also be used for photo metric purposes when once their coefficients of transmission have been determined Those having occasion to use them in this way will do well to consult a paper by Professor Langley Amer journ sc xxx 210 on this subject In this it is shown that the effective transmission coefficients are decidedly different according as the luminous image is an extended surface or practically a point like a star In the latter case there is a central image surrounded by a system of diffraction images into which a large part of the light goes so much so that Professor Langley found that a screen of which one and two thicknesses trans mitted 47 and 21 respectively of the full light upon a surface gave only 18 and 02 for one and two thicknesses respectively when measured by the brilliancy of the central image of a small pin hole as a source of light

belong to a network covering 33 stations extending from Paris to Omaha thus furnishing 21 rigorous conditions to be fulfilled by the longi tudes of the 33 stations a much stronger system than that

observers personalequation which the a priori probableerrors do not cover There is only one resulting correction to an observed value which reaches Os1 while in the latest adjusted system of European longitudes which involves 59 measures with 26 conditions although the average probableerror of a AX comes out only 0s035 yet there are six corrections to observed values which exceed 0s1 It will be seen that the American work compares very favorably with the European while it includes the three difficult transatlantic cable links Mr Schott has accepted the decision of the Meridian coinference and in his final table prints longitudes east of Greenwich as  and west as  He has also gone through the tedious process of computing the probableerror of a func tion of adjusted values for the

agreement in the three transatlantic determinations of the longitude of the HIarvard college observatory as given in the report for 1874 was more an agreement of adjust ment than of observation and that the observed values have really a range of 0s13 This is the most complete discussion of a network of longi tude determinations yet made and it well sustains the high reputation which the scientific work of the coast survey bears at home and abroad very much of which is due to the thorough work of Assistant Schott and his efficient computing di vision NOTES AND NEW7S VWHAT is in some points a remarkable circular is prefixed to the current number of the Zeitschrift fiur philosophie und philosophische kritik the most conservative and oldfashioned of periodicals The management of the zeitschrift announces a new policy in view of the tendency of the best thought of the day which is to strive for a re vival of the idealistic view of the universe it being compelled thereto not less by practical than by scientific considerations Therefore the polemi cal character of the zeitschrift will cease the reason for it having been removed In the second place the vast amount of criticism will give way to explanatory sketches and sympathetic notices of new books and results so that no investigation may have injustice done it at the hands of a re viewer of an opposite school More attention is to be paid to the historical aspect of philosophy and the social sciences and in especial will the work of countries other than Germany receive its shareNOVEMBER 27 1885 SCIEj of attention This liberal programme is a cheer ing sign and only shows that even the ultra conservatism of this oldestablished journal has had to yield to the spirit of modern progress  Dr Currier of New York has invented an apparatus by which the large class of deaf persons who have some small amount of latent hearing can learn to speak with greater uniformity and exactness The difficulty is that the person af fected hears only the voice of the teacher or the speaker through the tube but does not hear his own tones To accomplish this a tube goes first from the mouth to the ear of the deaf person and from there to the mouth or ear of the speaker  A stalactite cavern has been discovered in a hill called Kalksberg near Wolmsdorf The work men were quarrying for marble when they unex pectedly broke into the cavern which they ex plored for about a mile and a half In some places there were deep ponds and an inner cavern was found that could only be entered by means of a ladder they have only explored the cavern very imperfectly as yet  M Duclaux a disciple of M Pasteur has been studying the effect of sunlight on germs of parasitic life For three years he has been watch ing tubes containing cultures of Tyrothrix scaber This organism grows very well in milk or in Liebigs infusion by destroying albuminoid mat ter as pathogenic bacteria do Drops of milk con taining the organism were taken at the moment of spore formation and enclosed in glass tubes plugged with cotton wool so as to exclude external germs The milk having been evaporated some of the tubes containing the remaining spores were ex posed to various degrees of sunlight for various periods  a few days a month two months a whole summer Others were placed in a stove at a temperature equal to the maximum of tropical re gions in the dark or in diffused light Eventually small quantities of milk were introduced into the tubes so that the spores might be provided with the means of growth None of the tubes sub jected to warmth but sheltered from the sun have proved sterile  a fact which shows that the spores of the microbe in question even after being re tained in a dry state and subjected to tropical heat for three years do not lose their vitality if shel tered from the suns light Fifteen days exposure to the light produces no observable effect but after a months exposure germination becomes ob viously slower while 50 per cent of the tubes ex posed for two months have proved sterile Spores subjected to sunlight proved much more feeble in Liebigs infusion than in milk that is a much larger proportion of the tubes remained sterile CCE 475 after a given exposure if development in the for mer beverage was attempted than if the latter was the medium of culture Hence we must infer that not only is sunlight a powerful hygienic agent but that much depends upon the character of the liquid to which a disease germ obtains access M Arloing has tried similar experiments with the for midable Bacillus anthracis the organism asso ciated with that malady so destructive to sheep which when transmitted to man is known as the terrible woolsorters disease He finds not only that sunlight has an attenuating influence so that by its aid the germs can be converted into a vaccine but that the influence can be transmitted and in tensified through several generations A spore born of a  solarized bacillus is more susceptible to the reforming influence than its parent was  The Henry Shaw school of botany in Wash ington university St Louis was opened on the 6th of November by an inaugural address given by the professor Dr Trelease which has been printed While the school bears the name of its founder and will in due time take its full development in connection with the Missouri botanic garden at Tower Grove the first professorship as we are delighted to learn commemorates in its title the late Dr Engelmann By this address the earnest and judicious young professor begins to open the eyes of the St Louis people to the breadth the interest and both the educational and practical importance of the subject which he is to teach  Felix Plateau has recently published Bull soc zool France a series of interesting experi ments on the palpi of insects the results of which are quite opposed to the current idea that these oral appendages are essential both to the recogni tion and the seizure of food He found that beetles cockroaches etc may be deprived of either the labial or maxillary palpi or both and still retain the power of identifying and masticat ing their food It is very curious that the function of such welldeveloped organs should so entirely elude us  The Congress of German anthropologists will meet at Stettin next summer Prof Hugo Lemcke president of the City college as chair man of the local board of managers tenders an invitation to be present to all American students of anthropology desirous of attending the congress at Stettin where they will meet Virchow Schlie mann Schaffhausen and others and where their presence will be especially appreciated by the cordial hospitality of the Stettiners Mr E Lemcke of B Westermann  Co New York will undertake

courses of lectures M Mathias Duval lectures on zoological athro pology including comparative embryology and kindred topics General anthropology is in the able hands of Dr Paul Topinard whose lectures will cenatre about the discussion of races and types M Manouvrier lectures on ethnology giving special attention to normal and abnormal craniology Med ical geography by which is understood the action of the environment is the subject of a course by M Bordier The remaining courses are on Pre historic anthropology by M Gabriel de Mortillet and on the History of civilizations by M Letour neau The lectures are held weekly and in addition conferences are held from time to time The course of lectures was begun on Nov 9 7NCJEVOL VI No 147  Dr Topinard has published a revised series of anthropometric instructions for travellers The traveller he says need not trouble himself with questions of race but should merely observe vari eties of type For this purpose he should take measures of as large a number of individuals as practicable ten different measurements of one hundred individuals being more valuable than fifty of twentyfive persons The measurements must be so simple as to reduce the personal equa tion as low as possible They should also be so arranged as not to keep the subject in one attitude any longer than necessary Men should be selected for measurement rather than women All the instruments required may be collected into a small anthropometric box the slide being the most useful Dr Topinard furnishes a form for record ing results and remarks  M Mercadier recently described before the Paris academy of sciences experiments under taken in order to show that the elasticity of the metal diaphragms at the extremity of telephonic wires counts for nothing in the transmission of sonorous vibrations or rather that it merely gives to the voice the nasal tone associated with tele phonic conversation M Mercadier successively substituted for such diaphragms plates of greater and greater thickness pieces of cardboard and finally ironfilings The intensity of the vibrations was diminished but the tone of the voice became normal and the most delicate inflections were transmitted with perfect exactitude BOSTON LETTER VISITORS to Boston many years ago were struck by the then novel sight of large labels attached to the stately trees on the Common designating their scientific and common names and the country of their origin This simple device for the instruc tion of the public was almost entirely the work of a single publicspirited man the late Dr A A Gould the naturalist whom more than one gener ation of Bostonians held in the highest esteem Snatching the early hours from a laborious prac tice he could be seen by early risers tacking his tins upon one tree after another for a whole sea son After his death I think it was when these had grown dilapidated some city forester who like many others since appointed had no other than political

ENGLAND,I206929,153 XIX REMARKS UPON A PASSAGE IN CASTIL LIONES LIFE OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON BY JOHN WINTHROP LL D HOLLISIAN PRO FESSOR OF MATHEMATICS AT CAMBRIDGE IN NEW ENGLAND T H E R E IS A PASSAGE IN CAS TILLIONES LIFE OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON PREFIXED TO HIS EDITION OF THE OPUS CULA IN THREE VOLUMES 4TO PUBLISHED AT LAU SANNE AND GENEVA IN 1744 WHICH APPEARS TO ME A PALPABLE MISTAKE AND TENDS TO PLACE SIR ISAAC NEWTON IN AN INFERIOR LIGHT TO DES CARTES IN THE EYES OF FOREIGNERS IT IS THIS P XXXII  SAEPIUS SE REPREHENDEBAT NEUTONUS  QUOD RES MERE GEOMETRICAS ALGEBRAICIS RATIONIBUS  TRACTAVISSET

ESSE GEOMETRIS AD  INVENIENDUM THE AUTHORITY HE QUOTES FOR THIS IS DR PEMBERTON IN THE PREFACE TO HIS VIEW OF SIR ISAAC NEWTONS PHILOSOPHY BUT I WILL VENTURE TO SAY HE HAS MISINTERPRETED HIS AUTHOR HE REPRESENTS DR PEMBERTON AS SAY ING 1ST THAT SIR ISAAC NEWTON OFTEN CEN VOL LXIV X SURED REDDE JAN 20 1774154 SURED HIMSELF FOR HANDLING GEOMETRICAL SUBJECTS BY ALGEBRAIC CALCULATIONS 2DLY THAT ANOTHER THING HE OFTEN CENSURED HIMSELF FOR WAS HIS HAVING CALLED HIS BOOK OF ALGEBRA BY THE NAME OF UNIVERSAL ARITHMETIC 3DLY THAT HE COMMENDED DES CARTES AS HAVING DONE BETTER IN GIVING THE TITLE OF GEOMETRY TO HIS TREATISE ON THE SAME SUBJECT THE TWO LAST PARTICULARS CERTAINLY AND I THINK THE FIRST ALSO HAVE NO FOUNDATION IN THE ACCOUNT DR PEMBERTON HAS GIVEN OF THIS MATTER HIS WORDS ARE  I HAVE OFTEN HEARD HIM SIR ISAAC  CENSURE THE HANDLING GEOMETRICAL SUBJECTS BY AL  GEBRAIC CALCULATIONS AND HIS BOOK OF ALGEBRA  HE CALLED BY THE NAME OF UNIVERSAL ARITHMETIC  IN OPPOSITION TO THE INJUDICIOUS TITLE OF GEOME  TRY WHICH DES CARTES HAD GIVEN TO THE TREA  TISE WHEREIN HE SHEWS HOW THE GEOMETER MAY  ASSIST HIS INVENTION BY SUCH KIND OF COMPUTA  TIONS DR PEMBERTONS EXPRESSION DOES NOT AT ALL IMPLY THAT SIR ISAAC NEWTON CENSURED HIMSELF FOR HANDLING GEOMETRICAL SUBJECTS BY ALGE BRAIC CALCULATIONS THE ONLY IDEA IT SUGGESTS IS THAT HE CENSURED THAT WAY IN GENERAL AND THOSE WHO PRACTISED IT AND THAT HE HAD HIS EYE PARTICU LARLY UPON DES CARTESAND FAR FROM INTIMA TING THAT HE HAD INCONSIDERATELY CALLED HIS BOOK OF ALGEBRA BY THE NAME OF UNIVERSAL ARITHMETIC AND AFTERWARDS CENSURED HIMSELF FOR DOING SO AND WISHED THAT HE HAD RATHER CALLED IT GEOMETRY AS DES CARTES DID HIS IT DIRECTLY AFFIRMS ON THE CONTRARY THAT BY EXPRESS DESIGN AND CHOICE HE CALLED IT ARITHMETIC IN OPPOSITION TO DES CARTESS INJUDICIOUS TITLE OF GEOMETRY IT155 IT IS TRUE INDEED THAT IN A FOLLOWING PASSAGE DR PEMBERTON SAYS  OF THEIR THE ANTIENTS TASTE  AND FORM OF DEMONSTRATION SIR ISAAC ALWAYS  PROSESSED HIMSELF A GREAT ADMIRER I HAVE HEARD  HIM EVEN CENSURE HIMSELF FOR NOT FOLLOWING THEM  YET MORE CLOSELY THAN HE DID AND SPEAK WITH  REGRET OF HIS MISTAKE AT THE BEGINNING OF  HIS MATHEMATICAL STUDIES IN APPLYING HIMSELF  TO THE WORKS OF DES CARTES AND OTHER ALGE  BRAIC WRITERS BEFORE HE HAD CONSIDERED THE ELE  MENTS OF EUCLID WITH THAT ATTENTION WHICH  SO EXCELLENT A WRITER DESERVES  BUT THE MODE OF EXPRESSION HERE USED IS SO DIFFERENT FROM THE FOREGOING THAT THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT BUT THAT IT WAS INTENDED TO CONVEY A DIFFERENT MEANING AND IF IN THE CENSURE FIRST MENTIONED VIZ  FOR  HANDLING GEOMETRICAL SUBJECTS BY ALGEBRAIC CAL  CULATIONS DR PEMBERTON HAD UNDERSTOOD THAT SIR ISAAC MEANT TO INCLUDE HIMSELF THIS LAST PASSAGE WOULD HAVE BEEN A MERE TAUTO LOGY BUT THIS LAST STRONGLY IMPLIES ON THE CON TRARY THAT SIR ISAAC HAD IN GENERAL ENDEAVOURED TO FOLLOW CLOSELY THE ANTIENT GEOMETRICAL FORM OF DE MONSTRATION IN PREFERENCE TO THAT BY ALGEBRAIC CAL CULATION WHICH IS OF MODERN INVENTION THERE IS A REMARKABLE INSTANCE OF THE ATTENTION HE PAID TO THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THESE METHODS AND OF THE PREFERENCE HE GAVE TO THE FORMER IN HIS GREAT WORK OF THE PRINCIPIA HAVING IN LEMMA XIX AND ITS COROLLARIES GIVEN A CONCISE AND ELE GANT SOLUTION OF A NOTED GEOMETRIC PROBLEM HE SUBJOINS  ATQUE ITA PROBLEMATIS VETERUM DE QUA X 2  TUOR156  TUOR LINEIS AB

REFER TO DES CARTESS PROLIX ALGEBRAIC SOLUTION OF THIS PRO BLEM IN HIS GEOMETRY P 2534 WILL I BELIEVE BE READILY GRANTED BY EVERY ONE THAT IS ACQUAINTED WITH SIR ISAAC NEWTONS WRITINGS UPON THE WHOLE I HUMBLY CONCEIVE THAT DR PEMBERTONS MEANING IN THE FORMER PASSAGE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER EXPRESSED IN LATIN AS FOLLOWS  SAEPIUS EOS REPREHENDEBAT QUI RES MERE  GEOMETRICAS ALGEBRAICIS RATIONIBUS

UNDERSTANDS BOTH THE LANGUAGES I WOULD ONLY ADD THAT THIS MISTAKE OF CAS TILLIONE MUST HAVE BEEN OWING EITHER TO IN ADVERTENCE OR TO HIS NOT BEING PERFECTLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE AS HE ELSEWHERE AP PEARS TO HAVE HAD THE HIGHEST VENERATION FOR SIR ISAAC NEWTON THIS MISTAKE MAY TO SOME APPEAR TRIVIAL BUT IN MY APPREHENSION EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE RELATIVE TO SO ILLUSTRIOUS A CHARACTER AS THAT OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON157 NEWTON DERIVES IMPORTANCE FROM IT AND OUGHT TO BE MARKED WITH GREAT EXACTNESS THE FOREGOING REMARKS ARE WITH ALL DEFERENCE SUBMITTED TO THE JUDGEMENT OF THE ROYAL SO CIETY

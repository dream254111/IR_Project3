LIGHT THE most brilliant display of the zodiacal light that I have observed occurred on the night of April 8 1922 My point of observa tion was Poulan Worth County Georgia lati tude 3130 north longitude 8345 west The light covered more of the heavens than shown as a zone of zodiacal light in any of the sev eral hundred charts made of it by an observer with Commodore Perrys expedition to Japan in 18531856 and printed in a huge tomed report by the United States government as a part of the reports of that historic occurrence One great volume of the Perry reports is given over entirely to the zodiacal light forming the most massive single piece of literature upon the subject I have observed the zodiacal light from the Straits of Magellan to 46 north latitude without having seen such a display as the one here alluded to It dulled the near full moon There was not a cloud in the sky In the brilliant moonlight the zodiacal light made the spots in the heavens unilluminated by it looks like coal sacks so great was the contrast I have seen the aurora borealis above the Arctic circle and the aurora australis below the Ant arctic line and seldom were these exhibitions more brilliant and effective than the display that was neither on the night of April 8 last It must be true that observers in southern latitudes are often confused by the zodiacal light and take it for an auroral burst The zodiacal light is usually most noticeable in the western sky This one covered more than half the heavens irregularly It continued from 9 PM until 3 AM with varying bril liancy Judge Roberts P Hudson of Sault Ste Marie Michigan was my companion ob server on the night of April 8 CHASE S OSBour SAULT STE MAIE MICHIGAN THE MEALYBUG CALLED PSEUDOCOCCUS BROMELIUE AND OTHER COCCIDS IN my recent review of Wheeler on Tachi galia insects I gave a footnote questioning the validity of the name Pseudococcus bromeliae Bouche as applied to the species of mealy bug found on Tachigalia This has brought 308 SCIENCESEPTEMBER 15 1922 me a letter from Hawaii where an insect pre sumed to be the same is of economic impor tance asking for additional information Since the matter is one of importance to economic entomologists it may be worth while to state explicitly why Bouches name can not be used I have not seen Bouches original work 1834 but his whole description is quoted by Signoret In 1875 Signoret received a mealybug on pineapple which he described saying that it was probably Bouches Coccus bromelite Since there was already an entirely different Coccus bromelie published in 1778 now called Diaspis bromelice it appears that Bouches name was in any case unavailable Signoret uninfluenced by the homonym was still in con siderable doubt as to the identity of his insect and accordingly gave Bouches description so that the reader might form his own opinion That description is somewhat confusing but we are told that the fertilized female takes the form of a convex short elliptical shield a little narrower in front The last abdominal segment is cleft The females after an early stage remain in one iplace all their lives un less one tears them off The insect is common in greenhouses on various plants There can I think be little doubt that Bouche had before him the Lecaniid Saissetia hemisphacerica Tar gioni 1867 surely it was not a mealybug In the Fernald Catalogue of Coccide there is confused with this Lecanium bromelife Bouche grey marbled with brown which Signoret did not undertake to identify It was probably Lecanium hesperidum L Another coccid which seems to need discus sion is the large Lecaniid of the tuliptree Dr W E Britton Bull 234 Conn Agric Exp Station gives a good account of this insect bat calls it Toumeyella liriodendri Gmelin stating that it was so identified by Sanders after a careful study Gmelins Coccus liriodendri was based on an account by Dr John Hill of London appearing in the Ham burgisches Magazine for 1753 Many years ago I borrowed this work from the Library of Congress and together with Mr Pergande went over the description The account is very vague and contains some apparently inaccu rate statements but it evidently applies to a Lecaniid on the tuliptree We concluded at the time that it was not possible to reach a definite decision and were not in favor of dis placing Cooks name tulipifere 1878 There is no indication that any one has really recon sidered this evidence and I think the scale should stand as Tounmeyella tulipiferce Cook Sanders Journ Economic Entomology 1909 p 432 adopting Pseudococcus adoni dum L as the name of the common long tailed mealybug P longispinzs Targ refers to the good description of the insect in Systema Naturce Ed XII The good de scription refers to linea dorsalis longitu dinalis elevata   area inter lineam dosalem marginemque totidem punctis in seriem longi tudinalem dispositis    cauda bifida etc Conceivably this may be Orthezia urtice L but this is guessing There is not anything to clearly indicate the mealybug and part of the description contradicts such a reference I am in favor of using the oldest names when there is real evidence or even a satisfactory pre sumption in their favor but when the descrip tions are inapplicable it is another matter The application of the generic name Coccus L to the soft scales may have to be reconsid ered The original Coccus the word meaning a berry was the hard round scale of the oak commonly called Kermes Under the rules a good argument can be made for considering Coccus ilicis L Kermes ilicis the type of Coccus on grounds of tautonomy but there is room for diversity of opinion Lecanium pul chrum King well redescribed by Marchal 1908 should apparently stand as L rufulum Eulecanium alni var rufulum Ckll T D A COCKERELL UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO THE DETERMINATION OF FAT IN CREAM To THE EDITOR OF SCIENCE I noticed in SCIENCE for July 7 page 25 an abstract of a paper read before the American

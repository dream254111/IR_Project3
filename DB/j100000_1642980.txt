VOL XLVIII No 1262 sented by the president Sir J J Thomson as announced in last weeks issue of SCIENCE The characterization of the work of the medal lists as printed in Nature was as follows The Copley Medal is awarded to Hendrik Antoon Lorentz For Mem R S Lorentz is generally recognized as one iof the most distinguished mathe matical physicists of the present time His re searches have covered many fields of investigation but his principal work deals with the theory of electrons and the constitution of matter considered as an electrodynamic problem When Zeeman had discovered the effect of magnets on spectroseopic lines he perceived at once the theoretical bearing of the effect which led to the discovery of the eir cular polarization of the components of the lines split up by magnetic force Lorentz s name is also associated with that of Fitzgerald in the inde pendent explanation of the MichelsonMorley ef fect from which farreaching consequences have been derived An important optical relationship between the density of la medium and its index of refraotion independently by L Lorentz was pub lished in 1878 and he has been an active and fruit ful investigator ever since A Royal Medal is awarded to Professor Alfred Fowler Professor Fowler s investigations have been in the main on spectroscopy and one of his specialties has been the identification and reproduc tion of celestial spectra in the laboratory His ex traordinary success in identification of this kind is attributable in part no doubt to a special intuition but also to a great and laboriously acquired knowl edge of detail For instance the origin of the bands dlominating the spectra of stars of Secchis third class remained a mystery for many years Fowler showed that they were due to titanium oxide He accounted for many of the bandlines in the sunspot spectrum by showing that they be longed to magnesium hydride and several other instances of slearcely less importance might readily be given Another important branch of his work is connected with spectrum series The lines of many elements which appear in the are spectrum have long been classified into series and empirical relations have been obtained between the position of a line in the series and its frequency of oscilla tion Those lines which are characteristic of the spark and require higher stimulation were not in cluded in the scheme Fowler was the first to show that the sparklines form series at all For this purpose he had first to work out experimentally the conditions for obtaining an adequate number of lines belonging to these series Helium and mag nesium were the elements chiefly studied It was found that the sparkline series could be repre sented by formulae similar to those which hold good for the are lines but with a fourfold value of the universal constant holding for the arcline series of all the elements Apart from these investigations leading to re sults so simple and definite there is much descrip tive work on spectra standing to the credit of Pro fessor Fowler and his pupils which is highly ap preciated by specialists for its accuracy and tech nical value A Royal Medal is awarded to Professor Fred erick Gowland Hopkins Professor Hopkins was among the very earliest if not actually the earliest to recognize and announce that minute quantities of certain bodies the nutritive value of which had hitherto been unsuspected exert an enormous in fluence upon growth and upon normal adult nutri tion He showed that without these accessory fac torsvitamineisa diet otherwise full and seem ingly complete is incapable of allowing growth and even of maintaining bodyweight or life He has also made important researches into what may be styled the determination of the specific nutri tive values of individual main components of the protein molecule he has for example shown that when from a certain diet which was proved to maintain nutrition satisfactorily the two amino acids arginine and histidine were together re moved the diet though amply sufficient in energy and fully assimilable failed to maintain life More recently Hopkins has attacked the question whether an animals life can be maintained under the condition that in place of protein or of the entire set of aminoacids constituting protein a limited few of the several representative types of these constituents are provided in the diet He shows that when instead of the eighteen different aminoacids composing the protein five only are administered death rapidly ensues if those five be selected from the simpler aliphatie components e g lucine valine alanine glycine and glutamic acid but that on the other hand nutrition and life are satisfactorily maintained at least for a considerable period if the five aminoacids given be chosen from the more complex types such as tyrosine tryptophane histidine lysine and cystine which experiment has shown to lie outside the range of the synthetic power of the animal body The Rumford Medal is awarded to Dr A Perot and Professor Charles Fabry MM Perot and Fabry have introduced a new method of measuring 638 SCIENCEDECEMBER 27 1918 wavelengths by an ingenious method of utilizing the luminous rings formed by interference between two reflecting plates Their researches have proved of fundamental importance 1 In comparing accurately the wavelengths of different spectro scopic lines with that of some standard line 2 In comparing directly the wavelength of the stand ard line with that of the standard unit of length This comparison has confirmed in a remarkable way the previous measurements of Michelson whose method is less direct and miore lilable to certain errors The independent confirmation thus ob tained has therefore placed the subject on a much firmer basis The Davy Medal is awarded to Professor F Stanley Kipping Professor Kipping has worked with distinction during the past thirty years on a great variety of problems connected with organic chemistry involving fatty acids derivativesof hy drindone camphoric acid and its halogen com pounds the 7rderivatives of camphor racemism and pseudoracemism derivatives of quinquevalent ni trogen organic compounds of silicon including derivatives having optical aetivity due to the asym metry of the silicon atom The Darwin Medal is awarded to Dr Henry Fairfield Osborn Dr Osborns chief work has been in paleontology and in connection with it he has organized many collecting expeditions to the early Tertiary rocks of the west One of the results of his work is the more precise determination of the relative ages of the extinct mammals in North America and that has led to a correlation between the order of succession of the Mammalia in Eu rope and in America A good deal of this work was summarized in his book The Age of Mam mals in Europe Asia and North America pub lished in 1910 In 1900 Osborn had come to the conclusion that the common ancestors of Probos cidia Eirenia and Hyraeoidea would be found in Africa and the correctness of this view has since been confirmed by Dr Andrew s discoveries in the Egyptian Fayum Amongst the more important of Osborn s contributions to our knowledge of extinct vertebrata are his memoirs on the rhinoceroses the horses the titanotheres and the dinosaurs In addition to all the work he has done personally Dr Osborn has had a wide and most beneficial in fluence upon biological research in North America and he has produced a flourishing school of younger vertebrate paleontologists The Hughes Medal is awarded to Mr Irving Langmuir Mr Irving Langmuir is a distinguished worker in the physics and methods of production of high vacua He has studied the vapor pressure of platinum and molybdenum by heating fine wires in vacuo and noting the loss of weight He has in vestigated the speeds of chemical reaction of dif ferent gases on various metals at very low pres sures He has investigated also the dissociabion of hydrogen and its apparent abnormal heat condue tivity and the dissociation of chlorine and oxygen also the chemical activity of dissociated hydrogen His work on the emission of electrons from hot metals in high vacua led to the evolution of the kenotron and pliotron and of the half watt lamp His determination of the melting point of tungsten is generally accepted Much of his work such as the investigation of the cause of blackening of tungsten lamps is of commercial as well as of academic scientific value

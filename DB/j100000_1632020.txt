j100000,Science,1632020,Report of the President of the Carnegie Institution,i295901,SCIENCE A WEEKLY JOURNAL DEVOTED TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE PUBLISHING THE OFFICIAL NOTICES AND PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE REPORT OF THI PRESIDENT OF THE CARNEGIE INSTITUTION IN compliance with the provisions of article IV of the bylaws of the Carnegie Institution of Washington I have the honor to submit the following report on the work of the institution during the fiscal year ending October 31 1905 along with recommendations of appropriations for work during the succeeding year and with some suggestions concerning the future course and progress of the institution Coming as the writer has to the presi dency of an institution already well organ ized but still in the earlier stages of its development it is essential for the purposes of a report to assume as a point of de parture the plan and scope of operations found well under way Accordingly the resume of the work of the year given below is an account of work planned substan tially by the executive committee of the preceding year Similarly the recom mendations made with respect to the ensu ing year are mainly in accord with the lines of policy hitherto followed by the executive committee The additional ex perience of this year seems to confirm espe cially the wisdom of concentrating the resources of the institution on a small num ber of large projects rather than on a large number of small nroieetq Coneornino this  From the Year Book for 1905122 SCIENCE N S VOL XXIII No 578 mooted question however some observa tions will be found in a later section of this report As regards the larger aspects of the work of the institution this report aims to give only a few suggestions derived from a preliminary reconnaissance of the fields of activity already entered A survey of these fields not to mention other promising fields of activity will obviously require more than the available time of one year Existing Plan Scope and Mode of Admin istration of the Institution As a matter of record and as a matter of information to the general public which takes an enlightened interest in the affairs of the institution it seems desirable to ex plain briefly in this connection and at this epoch the plan scope and mode of admin istration of those affairs Referring to the articles of incorporation and bylaws pub lished on pages 18 of the Year Book for a full statement of the objects of the insti tution and the rules adopted for its admin istration the fields in which its activities are now concentrated may be summarized under four principal heads namely 1 Large projects whose execution re quires continuous research usually by a corps of investigators during a series of years Ten such projects are already under way 2 Small projects which are usually car ried on by individual experts during a lim ited period of tfme About three hundred grants in aid of such projects have thus far been made 3 Tentative investigations carried on by young men and women who have shown aptitude for research and have desired to pursue specific problems for one or two years A limited number of persons have been aided by the institution in this line of work in the hope that some of them might develop exceptional abilities 4 Considerable sums of money have been allotted annually for the publication of meritorious works which would not other wise be readily printed and for the pub lication of the reports and results of the investigations carried on under the auspices of the institution This promises to be a fruitful field of activity About forty vol umes of works in diverse fields have already been issued Briefly described the administration of the institution is vested in a board of trus tees which meets annually During the intervals between the meetings of the board of trustees the affairs of the institution are conducted by an executive committee chosen by and from the trustees acting through the president of the institution as chief executive officer Financial Statement for thpe Year 19045 The following table shows the balances brought forward from

Projects One of the tasks the president has under taken is that of conferring personally with all investigators at work under the auspices of the institution and inspecting all labora tories observatories or other establishments where projects of the larger type are under way Since there have been about three hundred and sixty men and women at work under grants during the past year and since they reside in widely separated locali ties it has been impossible to complete this task in the three hundred days thus far available for the work Nearly all of the more important establishments have been visited however and conferences have been held with nearly all of the investigators Considering the wide range and the tech nical character of the researches of these investigators it would be presumptuous to attempt in a general report anything more than a summary of their work and this summary may be brief since the reports of individual investigators which will be found on pages 5152 of the Year Book are designed to give all needed details Specially worthy of mention in this con nection are the ten larger projects now under way Without seeking to designate them by inelastic terminology for they are in a process of development they may be classified departmentally as shown in the following list which gives also the names of the principal investigators conducting these works of research Experimental evolution in biology Charles B Davenport Marine biology Alfred G Mayer Desert plant biology D T MacDougal and F V Coville Horticulture Luther Burbank Economics and sociology Carroll D Wright History Andrew C McLaughlin and J F Jameson Geophysics F D Adams George F Becker and Arthur L Day Nutrition F G Benedict R H Chittenden L B Mendel and T B Osborne Solar physics George E Hale Terrestrial magnetism L A Bauer Of these departments of research four have semipermanent quarters constructed or under construction by the institution These are the Station for Experimental Evolution in Biology at Cold Spring Har bor Long Island N Y in charge of Pro fessor Charles B Davenport the Marine Biological Laboratory at Dry Tortugas Fla in charge of Dr Alfred G Mayer the Desert Botanical Laboratory at Tucson Ariz at present in charge of a nonresident committee of advisers Dr D T Mac Dougal and Mr Frederick V Coville and the Solar Observatory now under construc tion on Mount Wilson near Pasadena Cal and in charge of Professor George E Hale Although these departments are barely started and necessarily require additional time for the formative stages they areJANuARY 26 190i SC ATENCE 125 already producing noteworthy results and need only the energetic application of pa tience and persistence to insure contribu tions to knowledge of prime importance Biological Investigations The observational and experimental work undertaken in animal and plant biology is of a fundamental character and is con templated it is thought according to a scale adequate for the solution of the very difficult problems presented The system atic study of these for a series of years can hardly fail to yield results of signal prac tical and theoretical value Several publi cations with reference to these investiga tions have already been issued and others will soon be ready for publication The advantages for research in botany and zool ogy afforded by our biological stations are attracting the attention and stimulating the activity of eminent investigators Several of the leading zoologists of America availed themselves during the past summer of the facilities for the study of marine fauna afforded by the laboratory at Tortugas Fla Similar use has been made of the oppor tunities presented by the station at Cold Spring Harbor N Y while the Desert Botanical Laboratory by reason of the novelty and the probable economic impor tance of its work is an establishment of profound interest alike to the scientific and to the general public Horticultural Experiments The horticultural experiments and the remarkable achievements of Mr Luther Burbank are well known in a popular way though it must be said that the more im portant aspects of his work remain yet to be interpreted to men of science as well as to the interested public Owing to the im practicability during the past year of securing the services of a trained biologist the preparation of a scientific account of the ways means methods and results of Mr Burbanks work has been delayed He has continued his experiments however as related in his report and it is hoped that the necessary arrangements for securing the scientific account of his work contem plated by the board of trustees will not be long deferred Little short of five years will be required for this work if it is done thoroughly well Department of Economics and Sociology As will be seen from the report of Dr WVTright the department of economics and sociology has undertaken a comprehensive project which should bring in a few years extensive contributions to the social and economic history of the United States and probably also equally important data for a forecast of American social and economic development The goal of science is ca pacity for prediction and although eco nomic and social science are still sometimes regarded as somewhat dismal in com parison with the older science of astronomy for example they are plainly destined to play an increasingly important role in the progress of mankind Department of Historical Research The department of historical research which was one of the first to be organized under the auspices of the institution has attained an assured position of prominence and approval in the historical world Under the energetic direction of Professor Andrew C McLaughlin this department has stimulated historical research to a note worthy degree The publications issued under his editorship have been widely read by students and by investigators and the demand for historical papers and docu ments issued and discovered by the depart ment is constantly increasing It is with regret that the executive committee has been called upon to accept the resignation of Professor McLaughlin to take effect at the end of the current fiscal year His re126 SCIENCE N S VOL XXIII No 57q port for this year will be found in the Year Book  and attention is invited to the summary he gives of the work of the department up to date Professor Mc Laughlin has been succeeded by Professor J Franklin Jameson formerly professor of history in the University of Chicago Geophysical Research Work in geophysics has been carried on independently by three investigators namely by Professor Frank D Adams at McGill University Montreal and by Dr George F Becker and Dr Arthur L Day of the U S Geological Survey Briefly characterized their researches aim to de termine the modes of formation and the physical properties of the rocks of the earths crust We may confidently expect that the results of these researches will be of great economic as well as of great the oretic importance The conditions of oc currence of rock constituents and materials including the precious metals appear now essentially discoverable by means attain able in the laboratory Certain kinds of rocks have already been made artificially and the making of others is only a question of time and the applica tion of available resources Publications already issued and in press from this de partment of work are furnishing remark able contributions to our knowledge of the properties of matter alike of interest and value to the theoretical physicist and to the practical engineer Investigations on Nutrition Some degree of novelty it may be said attaches to the investigations into the phys ics and chemistry of human nutrition car ried on by Professor F G Benedict at Wesleyan University Middletown Conn by Professors R M Chittenden and L B Mendel at Yale University New Haven Conn and by Dr T B Osborne of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Sta tion at New Haven Conn The details of these investigations are far too numerous and technical to permit adequate descrip tion here Summarily however it may suffice to state that Professor Benedict is making experiments on men similar to the experiments made by mechanical engineers on steamengines and power plants to de termine their physical properties and effi ciencies An apparatus has been devised whereby man as an engine or power plant may be studied as carefully and as conclu sively as any other mechanical plant An account of this apparatus and of the results to be expected from its use will soon appear as No 42 of the publications of the insti tution Professors Chittenden and Mendel on the other hand are studying the chem ical and physiological processes and effects in man arising from the qualities and quan tities of foods he consumes while Dr Osborne is engaged in an exhaustive de termination of the chemical properties of that large group of foodstuffs known as proteids The prospective value of these researches admits of no doubt and in addi tion to their direct bearing on the human economy in health and disease they possess a peculiar interest arising from the fact that the instruments of investigation are also the objects of research The Solar Observatory Of the larger projects undertaken by the institution the solar observatory ranks first in order of cost for initial construction and equipment This cost however is no more than commensurate with the magnitude of the problem attacked namely that of the physical constitution of the sun and his role in the solar and stellar systems of the visible universe The work of construction and equipment of the observatory has been pushed forward with great energy and effi ciency during the year Aso that the estab lishment may be expected to be nearly ifJANUARY 26 1906  SCIENCE 127 not quite complete by the end of another year Through the courtesy of the Uni versity of Chicago the Snow telescope of the Yerkes Observatory has been mounted and been in constant use at the solar ob servatory during the past summer This threefoot reflecting telescope has already furnished excellent results and justifies the sanguine expectations entertained with re gard to thefivefoot reflector now nearing completion The unusually favorable at mospheric conditions which prevail day and night at the site of the observatory have attracted the attention of astronomers and astrophysicists generally During the past summer a party under the direction of Professor S P Langley secretary of the Smithsonian Institution has been there ob serving data for the solar constant while Professor E E Barnard of the University of Chicago has utilized the peculiar facili ties of the site by installing the Bruce tele scope of the Yerkes Observatory and ex tending his remarkable photographic charts of the Milky Way Departmeent of Terrestrial Magnetism Not very remotely allied to the work of the solar observatory is the work of the department of terrestrial magnetism though the utility of the latter is perhaps more apparent than the utility of the former All of the sciences however like the phenomena of nature are more or less interrelated and this is especially the case with solar and terrestrial physics There is no doubt at any rate that solar activity and terrestrial magnetism are in some de gree related Since the publication of the investigations on terrestrial magnetism by the illustrious Gauss during the first half of the nineteenth century comparatively little progress has been made in either the ory or practise until within the past decade It is but just to remark that the recent friiit0M rvAen 1 bof acfivity intrhis line of work is due chiefly to the enterprise and energy of Dr L A Bauer in charge of the department of terrestrial magnetism The execution of the plan he has outlined for a magnetic survey of the oceanic areas as well as of the land areas can not fail to secure data of signal value alike to marine transportation and to magnetic theory By means of specially devised instruments and apparatus as explained in Dr Bauers re port the department has demonstrated the practicability of making magnetic measure ments on a moving ship and the brig Gali lee chartered at San Francisco and refitted for this special purpose is now engaged on such a survey in the North Pacific Ocean Considering that the oceanic areas are in the aggregate about three times the aggregate of the continental areas it is seen that the fulfillment of the plan con templated will add greatly to our knowl edge of the actual distribution of terrestrial magnetism even if it should not imme diately elucidate this obscure phenomenon Minor Projects Separate mention of the large number of investigations carried on by the aid of small grants would require undue space here It will be seen from the list given above that there were sixtyfour such grants subject to payment during the year Many more than this number of investigations however were under way while a few grantees of the year have been unable to begin their projects A number of researches undertaken by aid of grants made in previous years have been com pleted and offered for publication Some of these have been issued during the year and several of them are now in press It should be stated also that numerous pre liminary papers resulting from researches under way have appeared in the current journals A list of these obtained by aid ofthe authorA t1iemselves wIill be found on pages 4350 of the Year Book128 SCIENCE N S VOL XXIII No 578 Specially worthy of mention among the minor projects are the following by reason of contributions already published or soon to be ready for publication namely 1 The archeological and geological re searches of Professor Raphael Pumpelly in Turkestan The first volume of a report on these researches has been issued during the year and a second is in preparation Professor Pumpelly had planned to resume field work in Turkestan during the past summer but the Russian government de clined to permit him to return there at this time 2 The preparation by Professor Lewis Boss of a fundamental catalogue giving the precise positions of about six thousand stars embracing all stars from the bright est down to the sixth magnitude This will make a solid contribution to stellar astronomy 3 The researches on the moon by Pro fessor Simon Newcomb 4 The precise quantitative investigations of Professor A A Noyes and T W Rich ards in chemistry 5 The comprehensive researches in geol ogy and cosmology by Professor T C Chamberlin whose preliminary papers have already proved full of interest and sugges tion to a wide circle of readers 6 The work of Professor Carl Barus on the nucleation of dustfree atmosphere of Professor E W Scripture on researches in phonetics of Professor G R Wieland on American cycads and the work of Mr W L Tower on the evolution of beetles all of which are now in press Publications and Their Distribution One of the most pressing demands that fell to the president immediately after as suming the duties of his office was that of devising a mode of distribution of the publications of the institution Aegord ingly at the meeting of the executive com mittee held January 9 1905 the following tentative rules were submitted and adopted 1 That unless otherwise ordered by the execu tive committee the edition of the publications of the Carnegie Institution of Washington be 1000 2 That unless otherwise ordered by the execu tive committee the publications be distributed as follows a to the founder and trustees of the institution b to the leading public libraries of the world c to a few of the principal jour nals which give space to critical reviews of cur rent scientific progress 3 That subject to approval by the president authors of publications of the institution be per mitted to designate a list of 100 persons to whom copies of said publications may be sent free of charge 4 That authors be furnished free of charge with 25 copies of their contributions published by the institution 5 That the president have authority to distri bute not to exceed 100 copies of each publication of the institution if in his discretion it may seem advantageous to do so 6 That copies of publications not otherwise pro vided for be offered for sale at a price sufficient to cover the cost of presswork paper and binding plus an addition of 10 per cent Soon after the adoption of this basis for action a list of the principal libraries and institutions of the world contemplated un der rule 2 was compiled and having been approved by the executive committee the work of distribution rapidly followed The plan thus adopted has worked with out serious embarrassment up to date but it promises to become inadequate to meet the demands for gratuitous distribution to the less important libraries and to the great number of individuals who may be desig nated as bibliophiles rather than as users of books Concerning this matter some suggestions will be found in a later section of this report Great pains have been taken to secure a high quality of paper and firstclass press work for the publications of the institution This has proved no easy task since it has been essential to deal with many authors and firms whose desires standards andJANUARY 26 1906 SCIENCE 129 judgments are often found in conflict with what appears to be for the best interest of the work from the institutions point of view Thus some lack of obviously desir able uniformity in paper presswork and binding has resulted Certain of these defects have been unavoidable owing to the fact that some publications had been in trusted wholly to grantees or authors It is hoped however that arrangements will soon be perfected whereby the desired uni formity and excellence in paper and press work of the publications of the institution may be secured A list of the twenty volumes published by the institution during the year will be found on page 42 of the Year Book They aggregate 2339 octavo pages and 1450 quarto pages making a total of 3789 pages SUGGESTIONS CONCERNING PENDING PROB LEMS OF THE INSTITUTION Large Versus Small Projects Rationally considered the development of a novel institution like the Carnegie Insti tution of Washington can not be expected to proceed without encountering difficulties and dangers That the mere establishment of such an institution is no easy matter is witnessed by the fact that the Congress of the United States debated the question of founding the Smithsonian Institution for a decade before attaining a definite plan of procedure Although the Carnegie Insti tution of Washington has been free in large measure from difficulties in the way of initial organization it has nevertheless met with other difficulties of a somewhat ominous character Among these is that of the relative merits of large and small projects and hence large and small grants In the absence of experience it might well appear doubtful whether the income of the instifdtironYWtIy Pbest used iii p46m6ting a small number of large projects not likely to be undertaken by other agencies or whether the income may be best used in promoting a largenumber of small projects for which the ways and means are already in part available Strong a prior argu ments may be adduced in support of each of these extreme methods of administration of the income and the executive committee has no doubt acted wisely in taking a mean course testing thus simultaneously by actual experience the merits of both methods While careful observation and study of these methods during one year only may not justify the recommendation of any radical departure from the course hitherto followed it seems essential to indicate cer tain grave objections to the policy of award ing numerous small grants These objec tions are 1 The excessive amount of time and energy required in the consideration of ap plications for and in the administration of small grants Thus far the institution has formally considered about 1200 applica tions for such grants and has made awards to about 300 applicants but the amount of attention given to the consideration of formal applications represents only a part of the time and labor consumed by the im portunities incident to if not inherent in Sthe policy in question Many of the evils of the spoils system already confront us Some applicants file claims many are im patient for speedy action and may as in the case of academic degrees speak in the possessive case with respect to grants long before they are awarded 2 The returns from small grants do not seem to justify the outlay especially since it is applied in many cases to work which would go on as well without aid from the institution Probably a more deliberate and searching investigation of the applicant than iiks hitheAttV1en iacticablM would insure better results It is certain at any130 SCIENCE N s Vo XXIII No 78 rate that the possession of a laboratory and enthusiasm along with a bundle of recom mendations should not suffice to qualify an applicant for the arduous work of research 3 A graver objection to this system of small grants lies in its tendency to supplant other sources of support for scientific in vestigation in allied institutions and espe cially in colleges and universities The facts should be known that thus far the institution has carried on work through aid given to about 270 individuals connected with 89 different institutions Of these latter nearly three fourths are schools col leges and universities Since the normal condition of an educational institution too often borders on poverty it is only natural that investigators connected with such or ganizations should look to the Carnegie Institution of Washington for relief An easy calculation however shows that the possible relief from this source in inade quate Thus a conservative estimate of the men and women connected with Ameri can institutions of learning alone and cap able of making fruitful researches would include not less than one thousand The smallest average annual grant that would be effective in such work is 1000 Hence it is seen that twice the income of the insti tution would not begin to meet the demands on it coming from educational institutions alone Depending unduly on another in stitution for support tends also it would appear not only to dry up the local springs of support but to sap the independence of educational institutions That any of them should desire to know how much aid may be expected from the institution before ma king up their budgets for an academic year is a matter of serious import Obviously it is the duty of the Carnegie Institution of Washington to avoid the danger of sup planting while seeking in part to supple ment the functions of educationall institu tions No similar difficulties or objections have arisen in the administration of the larger projects of the institution In the case of these projects however the ways and means are provided by rather than for and the investigators are chosen by rather than fort the institution In short the institution is in this case enabled to assume and fix re sponsibility in the conduct of its affairs and to push them energetically whereas in the other case responsibility is divided energy is generally lacking and time and money are in constant danger of being frittered away amongst a multitude of minor in terests Summarily stated therefore the indica tions are that the policy of awarding numerous small grants to selfsuggested in vestigators is destined to break down under the sheer weight of the importunities it entails that the results to be expected from such grants are meager and that the award of them unless narrowly limited and care fully guarded may work grave injury to educational institutions New Projects The demands for attention from appli cants for small grants have left scant time during the year for the consideration of more important prospective work falling within the scope of the institution It has been deemed essential also to devote most of this time to the larger projects already under way with a view to increasing their facilities and insuring their success Never theless many new projects have been con templated and several of these may be formulated for action without undue delay whenever the institution is ready to con sider them Two of these projects which merit special attention by reason of the fact that they have been considered at much length by ad visory committees and byr ihe executive com mittee during the past three years are 1JANUARY 26 1906 SCIENCE 131 an astronomical observatory in the southern hemisphere and 2 a laboratory for geo physical research Referring to Year Books 1 and 2 therefore for voluminous details with reference to the history of these projects it is desired here to commend them as worthy of favorable action by the board of trustees as soon as the essential funds are available With regard to new projects in general it appears fitting here to call attention to the desirability of allotting ample time for the preparation of plans and specifications and to the necessity of allotting ample time for their execution The inevitable dangers that confront a research institution are dilettanteism and haste for results Thor ough deliberation in preparation and ener getic patience in execution are indispensable to the highest success of such projects Since the query whether different depart ments of research are likely to be equally promoted by the institution is often raised it seems worth while to remark that it is an obvious duty of the executive committee to select those projects which give highest ex pectations of adequate returns Projects of this kind are generally susceptible of denite specifications as to ways means and objects At present however judging from the great inequalities in definiteness of the projects submitted to the institution it must be much easier to formulate plans for good work in some sciences than in others Hence quite irrespective of per sonal prepossessions it seems best in this case to follow lines of least resistance pro moting chiefly those departments of re search which promise sure returns while seeking at all times to raise the less highly developed to the level of the more highly developed sciences Suggestions on Distribution of PPublcations A difficulty which is likely to beset the institution in the near future is that of a just and equitable distribution of its publi cations Society has only lately emerged from a period when libraries were main tained chiefly for librarians and book binders and when every scholar was either his own librarian or a bibliophile Along with this laissez fare system there grew up also a system of exchanges especially be tween learned academies and men of learn ing but the numberof such academies and individuals was until lately quite small and well within the limits of a possible free dis tribution or exchange of publications In recent decades however the number of institutions maintaining libraries and the number of individuals desiring access to publications have greatly increased The needs of individuals it must be said have been admirably met in a general way by the facilities afforded in all of the great libraries of the world so that the worker with books can no longer afford to be his own librarian any more than he can afford to be his own banker Nevertheless the demand for a free distribution of books has increased to an extent far surpassing the increase in effective libraries and effect ive workers with books This demand has grown to large proportions in the United States especially partly by reason of the broadcast distribution of public documents Questioning the wisdom of an indis criminate distribution of the publications of the institution the provisional rules given on page 128 above were drawn along conservative lines The experience of the year however shows that great pres sure will soon be brought to bear on the institution by individuals and by smaller libraries desiring to be placed on the free omnia list Since drawing up such a list which embraces about three hundred of the leading libraries of the world an attempt has been made toprepare various special lists of institutions and individuals to132 SCIENCE N S VOL XXIIT Na 578 which respectively publications in the varied departments concerned might be sent This attempt has developed certain baffling obstacles Chief among these is the awkward duty of discriminating between the persons and the institutions which should and those which should not receive books gratis The officer called upon to decide must necessarily play the role fre quently of a dispenser of favors and be thus subject to the charge of favoritism The practical questions raised by this matter are first Is the work entailed worth what it costs And secondly Does such work advance science My opinion is that both questions should be answered in the negative and my suggestion is that a dis tribution of publications at once practic able equitable and effective may be at tained by offering all of them for sale except those reserved for free assignment to authors and to the leading libraries of the world Publications thus distributed would be pretty certain to go where they are needed and they would thus also stand or fall by reason of their merits or de merits as the case may be Relations of Istitution to the Public Precisely what relations the Carnegie In stitution of Washington should sustain to the public is a question which does not ad mit a ready answer Experience alone can disclose a complete reply since it must evolve with the development of the institu tion itself Clearly however it must be regarded as a semipublic organization somewhat similar to a university More exactly it may be likened to a university in which there are no students Obviously the institution ought to sus tain close relations with universities since they are now the chief centers of research and within the limits permitted by mutual independence those relations should be co operative to the end that time and effort may be conserved Similar relations should obtain likewise between the institution and learned societies But the possible methods of effective cooperation remain essentially to be discovered Much less obvious though hardly less essential of provisional definition are the relations which the institution should sus tain to the larger nonacademic world One of the favorable signs of the times is seen in the intelligent interest taken in the affairs of the institution by this larger world In spite of a widely prevalent tendency to anticipate the marvelous and the spectacular from scientific investiga tions and thus to expect too much if not the impossible there is manifest a very gen erally just appreciation of such work Hence the commendable eagerness of the modern public to learn the results of re condite researches calls for some sort of cooperation between the institution and ex isting media for the dissemination of infor mation with a view to furnishing such in formation in a form at once intelligible and trustworthy This among many other questions concerning the relations of the institution to the general public seems to merit special consideration in the near future Attention may be not inappropriately called here to the fact that while the insti tution deeply appreciates the interest in its affairs shown by the public there is no pos sibility of following more than a small frac tion of the suggestion and the advice wel comed from that source for their abun dance is overwhelming and a choice must be made Out of the chaos of such sug gestion and advice and out of the delibera tions within the institution itself ways and means for growth and achievement will be found In the meantime there will be a common need for application ofthe for bearance and the patience so indispensableJANUAY 26 1906 SCIENCE 143 to the higher forms of research which it is the object of the institution to promote R S WOODWARD November 11

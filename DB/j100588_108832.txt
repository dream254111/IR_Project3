CAYLEY Esg FRS Received October 31Read December 5 1861 ONE of the first efforts towards the formation of the Calculus of Functions is due to LAPLACE whose solution of the functional equation of the first order by means of two equations in finite differences is well known Functional equations were afterwards treated systematically by Mr BABBAGE his memoirs were published in the Transactions of this Society and there is some account of them in Professor BOOLES Treatise on the Calculus of Finite Differences A very important functional equation was solved by POISSON in his Memoirs on Electricity which suggested to me the investigations I have now the honour to lay before the Society I have commenced by discussing the linear functional equation of the first order with constant coefficients when the subjects of the unknown functions are rational functions of the independent variable and have shown how the solution of such equations may in a variety of cases be effected by series and by definite integrals I have then considered functional equations with constant coefficients of the higher orders and have proved that they may be solved by methods similar to those used for equations of the first order I have next proceeded with the solution of functional equations with variable coefficients In connexion with functional equations I have considered equations involving definite integrals and containing an unknown function under the integral sign the methods employed for their resolution depend chiefly upon the solution of functional equations as effected in this paper The Calculus of Functions has now for a long time engaged the attention of analysts and I hope that the following investigations will be found to have extended its power and resources Let the functional equation be nf l28 nxrx2 pxFx where p is an unknown and F a known function Let n 2  rr osz 2r r and the equation becomes nn2 n 2 2rr cos 2zp2 r cos F  cos or if n 2 Cz lz prrcosMR W H L

beautiful soul in a beautiful body those are ones first thoughts about Jens Westengard Then one remembers that here was a man equally at home and equally honored in a New England farmhouse a Harvard facultyroom and a Siamese palace a man who held noble rank in an Oriental kingdom who was received on friendly terms by an English queen who was to have occupied a distinguished position in the most august assembly ever held on earth yet as modest and unassuming as simplehearted and un spoiled as when he earned his living as a stenographer in a Chicago office The rapidly changing circumstances of his outward life the sweet unclouded serenity of his soul give to his life a touch of romance unusual in this prosaic age of science Jens Iverson Westengard was born in Chicago September I5 187I His father was a Dane of an old family who gave his son a good commonschool education but was unable to send him through college The son made himself an expert stenographer but it was his ambition to graduate from the Harvard Law School and become a lawyer To that end he began to lay up money and to fit himself to pass the admission examinations required from all who were not college graduates He expected to be ready in i896 but the faculty having decreed that no one without a college education should enter the school as a regular student after i895 he cut his preparations short by a year He came to Cambridge in the fall of i895 with a little money an adequate acquaintance with Blackstones Com94 HARVARD LAW REVIEW mentaries and a sufficient knowledge of Latin and German to pass the admission examinations The unknown young man made his way in the Law School and in Cambridge as easily as he did everywhere through his life He was soon acting as secretary for several professors was popular in his class and was gaining high rank in his studies He became much sought as a private tutor but was not too busy earning his way to serve on the board of the LAW REVMW with distinction At graduation he stood second in a class of I 29 Just at this time the faculty voted to try the experiment of dividing the firstyear class into small sections in order to give the students at the beginning of their course the advantages of a small class with more frequent opportunity for discussion and more in timate contact with the teacher The plan as adopted provided for the division of the class in criminal law into two sections each of which in turn the professor in charge of the subject would teach while an assistant taught the other For success in this plan it was necessary to find a young teacher whose instruction should compare so favorably with that of his older colleague that the students assigned to his section would willingly stay there and not defeat the object of the division by following the professor and swelling the size of his section To fill this difficult position the faculty unanimously chose Westengard His legal ability his character and personality and his experience as a tutor marked him out as the one man among the recent graduates of the school best fitted for the appointment The experiment was a complete success If there was any observable drift among the class it was not away from the younger man The next year March i3 i899 he was appointed Assistant Professor of Law for five years He proved to have a winning manner and excellent method as a teacher and at once established his place in the school His future as a successful professor of law seemed clear and secure About the time that Westengard was appointed Assistant Pro fessor of Law Edward H Strobel was elected to the chair of Bemis Professor of International Law Strobel was a bachelor Westengard just married was setting up a home of his own and the two joined forces For two years they formed one household The intimacy thus arising made it natural for Strobel on his appointment in i903 to the important and difficult office ofJENS I VERSON WESTENGARD 95 General Adviser to the Siamese government to offer the position of Assistant Adviser to Westengard The question whether to accept or to refuse this offer was a diffi cult one On the one hand Westengard loved his work and was successful in it If he left it he would be giving up an honorable and congenial career for an uncertainty and he would be leaving his wife and his young son behind him On the other hand the romance of the Orient as well as the greatness of the work attracted him The fiat of his physician that he must leave Cambridge for a time turned the scale He accepted the appointment and before the open ing of the school in September I903 set out with Strobel for Siam The work that was ready to the hand of these two teachers of law was indeed a wonderful one The ancient kingdom of Siam country of a peaceful folk ruled by a king and government of cultivated gentlemen was being squeezed between the upper and the nether millstone of British Burma and French Tonquin The Advisers must obtain from Britain and France a just settlement of boundaries they must foster a native government that could sus tain the position thus acquired and they must perfect and bring up to the Western standard the Siamese administrative system already good for the Orient Strobel was a skilled diplomat and he was able to obtain favorable treaties almost at once In sug gesting governmental reforms they had the sympathetic and powerful support of King Chulalongkorn a very able and en lightened monarch A criminal code was adopted and other necessary legislation obtained After about five years of service Strobel died of a lingering tropical disease contracted in Egypt during a short leave home and Westengard became the General Adviser His place had already been made among the Siamese No one ever knew Westen gard without loving him The king he served was no exception nor could one hear Westengard speak of the king without realizing that their affection was mutual On Westengards return to Siam after his first leave the king was absent on a hunting trip and his first word on reaching his capital was Is Westengard come and as soon as he saw his adviser he kissed him on both cheeks The favorite of a king is proverbially hated most cordially by the court but no one ever hated or disliked Westengard The great work which he did for the foreign relations of Siam96 HARVARD LAW REVIEW during his advisership was the abolition of exterritoriality Like all Oriental nations Siam had been marked in its international relations with a certain badge of inferiority The native courts were not allowed to take jurisdiction over European or American sub jects who were entitled to have their suits civil or criminal tried in the consular courts Even Japan had only recently thrown off this condition Siam having adopted civilized codes and having occidentalized her administration had grounds for requesting the same privilege but it was hard for a small nation to secure the ear of indifferent foreign offices and to persuade diplomats for whom inaction was safe to change the beloved status quo Westengard proved to be an extraordinarily able advocate of a small state He could offer no good bargain he could threaten no bad alternative justice was his only plea But justice in the mouth of a charming sincere andenlightened advocate prevailed amazingly Treaties abolishing exterritoriality were rapidly obtained Westengard was showered with honors by the kings he served Rank orders and decorations were his reward for devoted service The old king died but his successors esteem for his adviser was as high as his fathers had been Westengards position was one of almost unbounded power for good to a people he had learned to respect and love He might spend his life in a rank little less than royal and occupy an imperishable place in the history of the Orient But after all he was an American and as he said the time had come when he must decide whether to remain one or to put off his native character and become Siamese The position of Bemis Professor of International Law at Harvard was waiting for him and he returned to Cambridge a private citizen again to undertake anew the laborious and obscure life of a teacher He came back to a very different school from the one he left In the twelve years of his absence all the older teachers who had been his colleagues had gone from the school Langdell had died in i906 and Ames in i9io Gray had retired in I9I3 and died in I9I5 and Judge Smith had retired in I9I2 The younger Thayer had just died tragically and the school was again in a time of stress It was a painful moment at the best to begin anew and the new beginning meant for him a change of climate of position of work and of thought Many a time during that first year Westengard must have wishedJENS IVERSON WESTENGARD 97 himself back in Siam He had to adjust himself to a different style of life he had to make himself master of three difficult subjects only one of which he had ever taught before and above all he had to reacquire the art of teaching law The last was hardest Seven teen years before young and fresh from the school teaching had been easy for him but in the twelve years of his absence he had grown to middle life in a very different occupation A good teacher must be quick of thought if not of speech he must be ready forceful graphic The diplomat must be patient and sure rather than quick unhurried considering carefully every word and act As a diplomat Westengard had to unlearn his teachers art and now a teacher again he had to change once more He set himself loyally to the task and at the end of three years had be come a power in the school and one of those on whom it chiefly relied for service and counsel in the future Then almost without warning peacefully courteously serenely he sank to rest Westengards early style as a teacher was assured incisive suggestive He was clever helpful inspiring After his experience in Siam without losing his clearness of presentation he became a teacher of force and power in whom strength of character and sincerity of soul thoroughness of research and matured judgment supplied the place of youthful zest He was one of the masters If he lacked Amess splendid sweep of thought Grays deftness of touch Keeners wonderful dialectic and the younger Thayers keen analy sis he was worthy to stand with them byvirtue of his shining courage and sincerity He taught comparatively few men but those happy few know that they were taught by a man of light and leading Of the loss to the school it is hard for one to speak whose personal grief is paramount It is impossible to overrate Westengards ability The time will come when his force of character his calm ness of judgment his trained statesmanship will be sadly needed It will be hard to find these qualities in another And his service to the school was nothing short of devotion For it he left an almost viceregal position to it he devoted days and nights of hard study and almost his last words were of regret at the difficulty he was causing the school by his sudden withdrawal His was no divided loyalty having no college ties his whole love was given to the school And loyalty was the bedrock of his character Joseph H Beale98 HARVARD LAW REVIEW W ESTENGARDS life work was in Siam There opportunity was afforded to bring out his true greatness Whatever influence he may have exerted as a teacher in the Law School was limited to two periods of five and three years Twelve years of his life were devoted continuously and exclusively to the service of Siam and even after his final departure he kept in close touch with that countrys administrative affairs As the representative of the Siamese government he was to have sat at the coming Peace Conference His intimate knowledge of European politics his thorough understanding of the working of the foreign departments of the Great Powers the respect with which he was regarded in the chancelleries of Europe his lack of prejudice clear vision and sure judgment would have proved of the highest value not to Siam alone but to all the twentyfour allied and associated countries which have been sacrificing and fighting these four years long to make a better world Death intervened at a time when opportunity was opening for his truly great qualities when international tasks for which his training and experience had so admirably equipped him awaited his sure hand Whatever impress he mhay have made on the Law School no appreciation of his greatness and no proper estimate of his capacities for the future can be arrived at without a thorough understanding of the magnitude and difficulty of the work he accomplished during twelve years of service in Asia Westengards devotion to his work in Siam was such that for the first seven years he took no leave except for a seven months tour of Europe in the company of the late king For ten years of the twelve he was separated from his family His one long period of leave in I9I2 he improved to visit the foreign offices of the European powers In the fall of I9I3 Mrs Westengard and his son Aubrey joined him in Siam for the first time The next June I914 he and his family came to America on leave but he returned again to Siam late in the year and there remained until his final resignation in June I915 At first he bore the title of Assistant General Adviser but duringJENS I VERSON WESTENGARD 99 Strobels long absence and illness from December I905 to Febru ary I907 he was the Acting General Adviser and after Strobels death he was appointed General Adviser with the rank of Minister Plenipotentiary As his years of service increased offices and honors were heaped upon him He was appointed a member of the Hague Permanent Arbitration Court France made him an officer of the Legion of Honor and Denmark conferred upon him the Grand Cross of the Order of Dannebrog The Siamese royal government bestowed upon him the highest honors Successively he was decorated with the Grand Cordon of the Order of White Elephant Grand Cross of the Crown of Siam Order of Chula Chom Klao and Order of Ratanaphorn These orders were ac cepted and worn gracefully but not too seriously for he wrote home I consider them of value because of the kindly spirit which is manifested by their disposal As he came to exert an influence in the government second only to the JlyIing every problem of internal administration and foreign diplomacy passed through his office He drafted laws made treaties arranged foreign loans built railroads improved agricul ture revised the kingdoms system of finance rearranged and classified the revenues and practically did away with the opium traffic and with gambling both of which had been a large source of revenue to the government The Siamese even to the common people came to have a great respect veneration and affection for Phya Kalyana Maitri as he was uniformly known To American friends who visited Siam however slight their claim upon him he dispensed a royal hospi tality not only in Bangkok but wherever they went in the king dom I am sure that we who have enjoyed the pleasures and royal conveniences bestowed upon us have all felt profoundly that the Siamese officials and people who served and feted us did so only because of the affection and admiration in which they held our fellow alumnus and countryman To all this I believe Sinclair Kennedy 97 and other visitors to Siam have borne testi mony When Phya Kalyana Maitri himself traveled into the re moter provinces of the kingdom he was shown royal honors In fact it was said that on his trip to ChiengMai in the extreme north the festivities and the welcoming pavilions prepared in his honorI00 HARVARD LAW REVIEW by the people of the province almost equaled those that the fol lowing year greeted the Crown Prince During the fall of i903 Strobel and Westengard were in Paris negotiating with the French government for a new Siamese treaty Strobel remained behind to complete it while Westengard preceded him to Siam by some weeks During the first summer the king sent Westengard as his per sonal representative to investigate the vexatious questions of the eastern frontier bordering on the French Protectorate of Cam bodia For months he traveled through a region where few Euro peans have been As royal commissioner he was shown every consideration by the local governors and won the confidence of the officials with whom he dealt His letters present a vivid picture of the country the wild life its interesting people and reflect an earnest man skillfully handling with success the most intricate problems of human psychology and attaining a consummate grasp of obscure human affairs They show too keen zest for life appreciation for beauty in nature and Asiatic artin short a great depth of human understanding From Battabong he writes in September i904 Most of our work is done and we have considerable leisure on our hands We have had a very delicate and difficult work to do I wonder if we have accomplished anything Time will show and very quickly whether we have erected a house of stone or only a palace of cards The country and people  the political situation  the problems of internal administration are all very interesting and very difficult I have seen a great deal of a state government and law such as our ancestors must have lived under a thousand years ago Curious institutions whose parallels in Europe are faintly outlined in old old books are in full vigor here but must fall swiftly before the approach of the white man armed as he is with powerful political weapons obtained through the treaties with Siam I see a province which is in reality a little kingdom At its head is a man who is certainly the Lord of his people His rule has been almost absolute Law Yes there is law  his word But as for the law of the printed page you can hardly find a line of it Until the white men actually settled down here  two or three of them  even the treaties hardly ran here In fact I found one important treaty was not to be found hereJENS IVERSON WESTENGARD I0i Debt Slavery not the repulsive form of servitude we had before the war but yet a servitude that usually lasts for life was abol ished in Bangkok thirtysix years ago I have told the governor it can no longer exist here but must go and he has agreed it shall The framing of a proper law on this point will be my first care on returning to Bangkok The old rule has been absolute but I am inclined to think that after all it was probably the best rule for the people however it is useless to philosophize on this point The old order must change All that can be done is to make the change in the least painful way Here speaks the born administrator thirtythree years of age and six months on the job His work with the local Siamese officials completed his mission took him to Saigon the capital of French Cochin China where he had a long and serious conversation with the Governor General covering the relations of Siam with France The understanding there arrived at led to better relations between the two countries and eventually to the treaty of I907 which settled all questions of dispute Strobel left Siam on leave in December i904 On the homeward journey he contracted the infection which so hampered his later activities and eventually caused his death in i908 From that time on the administrative burden was carried chiefly by Westen gard In the second treaty with France concluded in I907 he relinquished to the French all territory on the eastern boundary that was not inhabited by Siamese and in exchange secured the return to Siam of more vital districts nearer the capital thus placing the boundary on a secure geographical and ethnical basis which insured stability and permanence Moreover Siam obtained im portant modifications in the exterritoriality of French subjects in Siam and from an attitude of stimulated nationalism and antagonism he brought the Siamese people and government into cordial relations with their French neighbors thus paving the way for Siams support to France in the Great War But perhaps his greatest triumph in foreign diplomacy was the treaty concluded with Great Britain in i909 By its terms Siam relinquished to Great Britain all claims over three petty states in the Malay peninsula over which Siam had exerted only a nominal sovereignty In return the British government gave up their exterritorial rights and granted a loan of six million pounds atI02 HARVARD LAW REVIEW four and onehalf per cent which Westengard proposed to use in building a railway from Bangkok through the Malay Peninsula This treaty was strongly opposed by the whole cabinet and even by the King holding that such a railroad paralleling steamer transportation could be of no advantage The King finally yielded because of his confidence in Westengard which was soon justified for the railroad paid from the first and since its completion in I917 when shipping was practically unavailable it provided the one outlet for Siams tin and other valuable products Moreover the money borrowed at four and onehalf per cent was so well invested in public utilities that a few years later Siam was loaning the same money back to the Federated Malay States at six per cent After the ratification of the British treaty which involved a long period of delicate diplomacy and incident strain Westengard with some pride in his achievement wrote to one who regretted his long absence from the Law School maintaining that the work he was doing was at least equal to that of a moderately successful law teacher I do think it is more than that  though perhaps I am not competent to judge Only I think I may safely say that the average law teacher could nt do it Siam has rid herself of ex territoriality as far as concerns the two most important powers Lord Cromer with the whole power of the British Empire and the British Army of Occupation has hardly moved one inch along that path for Egypt I remember well that I dined one night with President Eliot when pointing out the happiness of the law teachers lot he said that the practicing lawyer was a man whose name was writ in water No man should boast till he has safely finished his task but come what may in Siam my name is writ more substantially on the land than that Westengard early won the confidence of the late King Chula longkorn who was always reasonable with a profound sense of the right and later ready to yield his own inclination to what he con sidered his advisers better judgment Gradually he won the confidence of all the kings ministers the respect of the foreign ministers and other foreign advisers of the government Adminis trative circles in the East with their intricate diplomacy delicate problems conflicting claims are notoriously a hotbed of jealousies Westengards intellectual calm his smoothly accurateworkingJENS IVERSON WESTENGARD I03 mind his profound sense of right his capacity to see the other point of view his masterly analysis of intricate problems his capacity for multitudinous detail won for him an influence in the kingdom second only to that of the king and a standing with the representatives of foreign governments such that a distinguished traveler visiting Siam once remarked that Mr Westengard was the only European administrative he had encountered in the East of whom he had heard no unkind criticism With the new king his influence was not less than with his father If the relation was less intimate and affectionate it was perhaps because the younger man regarded his adviser with the respect due an elder who had already arrived before he had come to take up the reins of power Of an important change in the policy of the kingdom put m effect the first month of the new reign he writes December I3 I9IO Naturally I am not in a position to say whether my remarks have had anything to do with accomplishing the most desirable result I shall never know nor do I care to inquire for if that be the case it is the highest good I have yet done here However as I suppose is most often the case with the really great things that are accom plished the world does not know who really brought them about   Do not be surprised if when I leave Siam no great praise is given to my work The best things I have done are not known  sometimes not even to myself But this is the lot of most public men It is particularly so here because I honestly feel that I can do most good by retiring as far as possible from the appearance of driving the machine Success and the governments increased confidence brought new tasks From this time on every measure that did not originate there was referred to Westengards office for revision We find him negotiating treaties with Denmark and Italy proposing ministers and ambassadors bringing together for the coronation the greatest assemblage of European royal personages that had ever met in Asia planning new water works building and operating railroads revising the kingdoms finances and system of internal revenues He drafted a vast body of law modified existing laws and as judge of the San Dika the Supreme Court of Appeal inter preted statutes He wrote thus of his work September 29 I9IO But you know the nature of the tenure on which in my ownI04 HARVARD LAW REVIEW mind I hold the post It is only as long as I can see that I am able to do effective work But I also think that this is one of the great reasons why I have been able to do some effective work It is true that an enormous amount still remains to be accom plished But of course the art of government is one which must be pursued incessantly and in a place like this where so much has to be built up  where so many bricks must be made without the requisite straw  the task is even larger than at home where the machinery and establishment of government is already so old The problems that we now face here are becoming more and more like the ones that confront the governments of Europe and America In so doing the face of affairs changes I feel as if with the signing of the British treaty the heroic age closed No more can we negotiate for the surrender of territories as large as a small kingdom in Europe No more alien races populate sections of what was once called the Empire of Siam Many treaties are still to be negotiated but they are of a different character Apart from these the most interesting questions are those of legislation As you know we must make our codes This work is not only necessary for the internal administration but it is of great political importance When in June I9I5 he took his final departure the Siamese government the press and the people were outspoken in their expressions of regret and gratitude Mr Hornibrook then the American minister at Bangkok wrote the State department The great progress made along educational political commercial and sanitary lines in this country has been largely due to the influ ence of the General Adviser An article published in a Bangkok vernacular newspaper from the pen of the King himself states During the twelve years in which Phya Kalyan filled first the post of Acting General Adviser and later was promoted to General Adviser he has served in these posts with great faithfulness dignity and conscientiousness rarely rivalled His friendliness and social intercourse with the Siamese have been such that those who come in contact with him in business sometimes forget that he is not a Siamese In all matters which he has had to examine and carry through he has always been actuated with the desire to further the interests of Siam He labored without any discouragement in spite of the difficulties or laboriousness of the task and continued trying withJENS IVERSON WESTENGARD I05 patience until all difficulties have been overcome Phya Kalyan ought to be held up as an example of a man true to his post Westengards years of devoted service to Siam were in part due to his love for the people a love in no way touched by the slightest color of false sentimentality He knew the East to respect it Thus he writes  I suppose I have seen the East under some of its most attractive aspects for I have gained the confidence of one of its peoples those Sullen silent peoples Who weigh your God and you though the Siamese like the Burmese are probably the most cheerful and open of the races of Asia For me Asia will always have the attractions that come from its antiquity and the fact that it is the birthplace of most of the peoples and of all the great religions of the world To his task he brought humility sympathy clear judgment unlimited patience and indomitable perseverance The spirit of his work through the twelve years is set forth in a letter written in September i904 after eight months in Siam It has been a busy and trying time The situation here is extremely difficult and delicate I am trying to do the best I can to adjust the ancient regime to the rules of a modern civilization which is at the door which has one foot over the threshold and will not be denied complete entrance    I can understand and sym pathize with the views of both sides I must confess to a very serious doubt that the white mans regime with all its just laws and administration is really better for the native than the rule under which he has lived But whatever I may think on the matter I must deal with an actual situation and do the best I can Entering on great administrative tasks at the age of thirtythree he bore every burden with equanimity solved every problem that presented itself won the love and affection of the people and the confidence of her rulers and universal respect in the chancelleries of Europe Whereas Englands empire builders and colonial adminis trators have worked as part of the great imperialistic nation with the active participation and assistance of permanent colonial undersecretaries of state who have devoted their lives to the understanding of the problems of a particular people Westengardio6 HARVARD LAW REVIEW after Strobels death worked absolutely alone Our own state department had little knowledge of or direct interest in his work and gave it no backing Because of his modesty and reticence his own countrymen knew little of the great work he was accomplishing He brought to his work the most engaging personal qualities of an impersonal man  one who thought not of himself but always in terms of the people of the problem before him The principle the aim was always the propulsion never just what he the man was trying to do Porter E Sargent 96JENS IVERSON WESTENGARD 107 1 GOOD many of my American friends who attended Professor Westengards funeral last September have expressed to me their surprise at the large number of students Siam has sent to Harvard University I had to explain that not all of them were Harvard men in fact only a few were living in Cambridge but that the majority of them have come from other colleges and schools to pay their last respects to the man who through his notable achievement in their country has become so well known to all of them and whose death meant so great a loss not only to their government and people but especially to themselves too For although with his retirement Mr Westengard indeed severed his official relations with Siam in the capacity of one of her high gov ernment officials he nevertheless preserved that great interest for the future welfare of the country that he for many years so faith fully served An instance of his friendship to Siam is well shown by his relation to the officials of the Siamese Legation in Washington to whom he was the best adviser on the internal affairs of Siam herself as well as on her relations with foreign powers Just as lively was however his interest in the progress and development of the Siamese students whether sent to this country by the Government or private persons for as he himself has said in the hands of these young men lies the future of Siam None appreciates his remark better than the Siamese students themselves Although Mr Westengards relations to the Siamese students in the United States would only form a very small chapter of the history of his great work for the good of Siam it is none the less of some interest as it illustrates in a small scale how his sympathetic attitude towards the Siamese people has earned him such a splendid position of Iove and respect deep in their hearts 1 There are a considerable number of Siamese students in this country some sent by the Siamese government some by unofficial enterprise and some by their own families An official of the Legation supervises all the educational work of these students This article was prepared on their behalf as an expression of their apprecia tion of the memory of Professor Westengard  EDIo8 HARVARD LAW REVIEW Professor Westengard on being consulted about the sending of students to be educated in foreign countries never exercised his personal influence upon the officials who had the choice in their hands in favor of sending them to his own country in particular Yet many of the officials as well as the parents of other students were persuaded to send them to this country in the first place of course by the desire to avoid the war conditions of Europe but not to a small degree by attraction to the personality of the former American adviser People in Siam knowing America only from what was left in their memory of the geography lessons and the atlas in school hardly realize the enormous expansion of this country so that we often find among students coming to study at the University of California for instance a man who prides himself on having a letter of introduction to Professor Westengard and was told to drop around on Sunday afternoon to visit him when the Professor is not so busy All his friends in Siam whether connected with him in their official capacities or only socially are anxious that their sons should not miss the opportunity to pay a visit to the General Adviser in his home country and thus enjoy even only just a little of the privilege of being his friends friend None of the students who ever have reached him were dis appointed for each and all of them he would greet with the same characteristic gentleness that so much pleased the Siamese at home He asked them of their parents and relatives often remem bering and pronouncing correctly names most unpronounceable to other Westerners His memory for faces and names set us in aston ishment he would recall every kindness he received from the Siamese people with touching appreciation The Professors intimate knowledge of the persons and their good and bad characteristics is well illustrated by this little anecdote which perhaps with some apology can be quoted here A certain Siamese student S  came to Cambridge and asked to be taken to be introduced to Chow Koon Kalyan as we called him by the title given to him by the King of Siam As soon as I introduced the young man as the son of Admiral S who was by the way as many sailors inclined to profanity in his expressions Ah yes exclaimed our Professor I am very gladJENS IVERSON WESTENGARD lo9 to meet you here Then turning to me he asked in a low voice Does he swear like his old father I denied it Professor Westengards interest for the Siamese students of this country began with the sending of the first few while he was in Siam He followed their career closely and visited them sometimes when on leave in this country Thus Mr Nai Aab then a Siamese student at Harvard and for one year president of the Cosmopolitan Club of this University received through this kind recommenda tion a very beautiful portrait of the late King of Siam as a gift of His Majesty to the Cosmopolitan Club of Harvard Last year the Siamese government was able to establish scholar ships to enable successful students of Siamese law schools to come and perfect their training in American universities Mr Westen gard who always manifested sympathetic interest in the study of law by the Siamese students was asked by the Minister of Justice to act as an adviser to the students sent by this scholarship He gladly complied with the request of the Minister and took up most carefully and individually the problems and needs of each of the young men He corresponded with them and enjoyed the progress of even their English letterwriting In view of the admiration the Siamese have for his knowledge of law it is not surprising that all our law students should have a great ambition to become one of his pupils for this qualification would be better than other recommendations they could bring back home to Siam The other students who do not specialize in law also receive their full share of his kind attention they were free to come and consult him on all kinds of problems In spite of his pressing work Mr Westengard had time enough left to help everybody The greatest benefit and at the same time the greatest pleasure derived from intercourse with the Professor was to discuss with him Siamese affairs We could not find a better opportunity to learn the history of our country than from the statement of such an eminent authority Professor Westengard has occupied one of the highest and most confidential positions in the Siamese government He had access to all the archives of the kingdom and was one of the best informed about her recent history in the latter thirteen years of which he was one of the most prominent of its makersI1 IOHARVARD LAW REVIEW With his glorious gift of clear and concise expression he rendered the tangled chains of events intelligible and simple to remember again avoiding the monotony of one thing following another chronologically he added much fascination to his story by making a panoramalike sketch of a vast situation and again he would paint in the minutest details an important action in which perhaps he himself took part as the driving impulse or as a silent witness His comments on the situations and the people therewith con nected or responsible for them were sometimes favorable some times not but always frank and fair and above all most logical His criticism of the Siamese government however severe was given in such a delicate expression that none of us could have felt hurt although it always had the full effect upon everybody His judgment deserves to our mind the greatest confidence by the one fact that he was a citizen of the United States a country politically disinterested in Siam but very friendly to her His personal integrity and fairmindedness would exclude any kind of prejudice or misrepresentation of facts Mr Westengard keen observer as he was understood human nature which he used to say is governed by more or less the same kinds of passions whether Eastern or Western    composed of strength and weakness greatness and selfishness If all the people of the West had understood as well as Mr Westengard did the nature of Oriental peoples many grievous hours would have been avoided Although he shared with us the love and veneration for those who so wisely have guided our little nation through the period of adolescence yet he was not blinded by the glory of their achieve ments like the rest of us but could give us a fairer estimate of their real worth their human weakness and errors but also their praiseworthy qualities We do not feel deprived of that mysterious respect and confidence of Easterners for their great ones on the contrary our admiration grows with his words because he has added a touch of the purely human to their other almost divine qualities He showed us that those men did not do miracles but did more they were possessed of wonderful human resourcefulness The fact that Mr Westengard did so much and so well for the happiness of Siam we could learn from everybody out there but to hear him give account in such a modest and unassuming wayJENS IVERSON WESTENGARD III of some of the most important events of our history shaped by his own hands was a priceless privilege that alas was granted to an unworthy few and only for such a short time Talking with Professor Westengard I often felt like having dis covered the quiet and crystalclear source of the stream that made our dearly beloved soil of Siam ever so fertile and the people who live on its banks one of the happiest in the world Having received all these valuable informations from his own mouth we feel that we shall now better appreciate the great good we possess in that independent and free land of ours It is curious and touching though that we should have to travel ten thousand miles across the ocean to find through this brilliant son of America the faith and hope in our country again For the sake of his noble and serviceable work in Siam as well as what he has been to us students far from home we venture to appeal to Professor Westengards American friends to be persuaded not to feel so keenly the regret for his long absence during his best years but rather to rejoice in being able to give through this one of your most brilliant countrymen so much strength and happiness to a small and friendly people A Siamese Student On behalf of all the Siamese studentsI12 HARVARD LAW REVIEW IT was singular that Mr Westengard should have returned to the Law School to become Bemis Professor of International Law in the fall of the year I9I5 at the precise time when events were be ginning both to disclose and to increase the practical importance of the law of nations The world had suddenly found that the regulation of international conduct was for the time being a great deal more exigent than the regulation of individual relations and accordingly the study of international law was greatly developing everywhere even in that most utilitarian of educational institu tions the Law School A relatively large number of men took Mr Westengards course and when he came in i9i6 to teach Admiralty a number elected that course also It was in the work of these courses and of the graduate course in war problems that Mr Westengards heart really lay I think He taught property and torts well and he was interested in them both but I am sure that he had not for either of them the keen enthusiasm that a delicate question of international law or a vivid picturesque and frequently intricate question of admiralty would promptly arouse in him He was a master of the technical reason ing required for the problems often such dry ones of the common law but he preferred those fascinating questions whose solution sometimes took one back to the laws of Oleron the Black Book of the Admiralty or the De Jure Belli et Pacis of Hugo de Groot upon the answer to which might rest the action of a nation and in whose determination heavy and inextricable cords of policy so often pulled one way and another The law governing the rights and duties of neutrals for instance was to Mr Westengard peculiarly vital he once said speaking of the Netherlands and the Scandi navian countries My heart bleeds for the poor neutrals As has been said Mr Westengard returned to the Law School after a most honorable and successful career in Siam during the course of which that country had achieved the fullest measure of independent sovereignty at a fortunate time He brought to his new duties not only much experience in diplomatic practice and in the administration of international law but also wide learningJENS IVERSON WESTENGARD II3 sound judgment and a certain quality of intellectual candor and courage which contrasted oddly with his habitual caution He could neither be forced nor manceuvered into taking a position however safe and sound it might seem until he had convinced him self that it was not probably but surely so But once he had con vinced himself of this he did not hesitate to express an opinion which others and those the greatest of authorities might not share Thus when the Supreme Court affirmed the District Courts decision in the celebrated case of The Appam Mr Westengard after giving the opinion of the court more consideration than the writer of the opinion appeared to have given to the case did not hesitate to say without going into other serious questions pre sented by the decision that he wished the court could have felt free to explain at a little more length its reasons for making so distinct an addition to what had been for more than a century the settled jurisdiction of neutral courts of admiralty Mr Westengard came back to the Law School at a fortunate time but he had only a short period in which to make a record of his presence He must have wished when he began to teach inter national law to turn out as the finished product of his courses men whose diligence would make the library of the Marquis de Olivart an asset to the nation men who by reason of the intensive training of the case system would become not publicists who wrote upon international law but real international lawyers This in a small measure only he may have been permitted to do But he did succeed in imbuing his pupils with a realization of the inherent fallacy of inter arma leges silent with a belief that the highest national service is the establishment of international law and with a deep personal affection for himself John Raeburn Green DEPARTMENT OF STATE WASHINGTON D C November 4 i9i8

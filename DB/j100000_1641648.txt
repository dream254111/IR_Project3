give the dis ease a more descriptive titlethat now pre vails in New York has not unnaturally given rise to a certain degree of anxiety in our own country also During the last two months this epidemic has caused the death of some 1400 children in New York the mortality being about 25 per cent comparatively few adults have been attacked Quarantine regulations are now being widely enforced in the neigh boring districts and children under 16 years of age we read in the Times are forbidden to travel to the vast inconvenience of holiday makers The public health authorities in New York are only too familiar with epidemic in fantile paralysis for the disease is always pres ent and always more or less active in that cos mopolitan town They are endeavoring to limit the epidemic by the isolation or quaran 352 SCIENCESEPTEMBER 8 1916 tine of the most susceptible part of the popu lationthat is to say of the children No more effectual way of dealing with the situa tion is known The disease is one that has been studied with great success during the last few years in America more particularly by Flexner and his pupils to whom we owe many of the re cent discoveries made as to its etiology and the way in which it may be communicated from one person to another The great advances made in this regard during the last five or six years may perhaps be shown by a brief history of the disease It was first isolated as a dis tinct entity from the mixed mass of paralyses affecting children by von Heine in 1840 re ceiving the name spinal paralysis of chil dren naturally there could be no exact knowledge of its pathological anatomy at this early date Two or three decades later Pre vost and Vulpian Charcot and Joffroy and others described accurately the microscopical lesions that could be found in the spinal cords of patients dying of the disease In 1890 Medin taught by the study of a Swedish epi demic of infantile paralysis extended our knowledge of its various clinical types par ticularly in the symptomatology of their initial stages Further advances were made by Wickman in 1905 and the succeeding years particularly so far as the epidemiology of the disease is concerned Many other physicians and pathologists could be mentioned as having cleared up various obscure points in connec tion with infantile paralysis or as it is some times termed HeineMedins disease or the HeineMedinWickman disease its bacterial cause was looked for with great persistence and between the years 1898 and 1907 was identified by a number of observers quite wrongly with various cocci cultivated from the cerebrospinal fluid of patients who had or had died of the disease Fuller experience however proved that errors had been made here and in 1911 R6mer summed the matter up correctly when he said that the true bac terial cause of the disease was still unknown Both cultural experiments and experiments on animals had failed to reveal it Yet the sea sonal and epidemic incidence of infantile paralysis and the inflammatory character of the lesions observed in it post mortem made it certain that some living and transmissible virus was the cause of the disease So far as its transmissibility was concerned Landsteiner and Popper have shown that cer tain apeshamadryads and macaquescould be infected with a disease indistinguishable from infantile paralysis as we see it in chil dren by inoculation with an emulsion of the spinal cord of patients dying of the disease The virus was found to be a filterpasser and to survive preservation in glycerine for many months In 1912 Kling of Stockholm suc ceeded in recovering the virus from washings from the mouth nose trachea and small in testine of fatal cases of infantile paralysis But the actual microbe causing the disease re mained unknown until 1913 when it was iso lated grown on artificial media and carefully described by Flexner and Noguchi The suc cess of these investigators where so many others had failed is to be attributed to their discovery of a suitable culture medium Growths were made anserobically under a layer of paraffin in a solid agar medium containing sterile unfiltered ascitic fluid or brain extract and sterile rabbit kidney Minute colonies of the virus were obtained composed of globular or globoid bodies averaging in young cultures 015 to 030 A in size arranged singly or in short chains or masses Third generation cul tures from human tissues and cultures in the fifth generation from the tissues of experi mentally infected monkeys were found to pro duce typical acute anterior poliomyelitis in ex perimental animals At the present time therefore we are in the possession of a good deal of positive knowl edge with regard to the pathogenesis and epi demiology of infantile paralysis The virus producing the disease has been isolated culti vated and employed for the transmission of the disease to experimental animals in in vestigations that have proved invaluable and indispensable for the increase of our knowl edge of its spread among human beings The virus has been found in the nasopharynx of human carriers of the disorder who though they have never apparently suffered from it SCIENCE 353N S VOL XLIV No 1132 themselves yet are capable of transmitting it to others The virus has also been found in the alimentary tract of patients and experi mental animals with infantile paralysis a fact which may explain why it is that a gastroin testinal upset sometimes precedes and appears to be the cause of an attack of infantile paraly sis The virus has been proved to reach the patients central nervous system in which its main pathological action is exerted by travel ling along peripheral nervesthe sciatic the nasal nerves the optic nerves and tracts for exampleto the spinal cord or brain as the case may be and this is to be regarded as the normal mode of infection in poliomyelitis gross infection of the blood stream with the virus may also suffice to infect the brain Evi dence has been adduced to show that certain flies particularly Stomoxys calcitrans the common stable fly may act as carriers of the disease In addition the virus has been found on clothes handkerchiefs and toys used by pa tients in the acute stages of infantile paraly sis The careful examination of washings from the mouth or intestine have shown that human beings may remain carriers of the virus for as long as six months According to Kling quarantine for infantile paralysis chould last at least a fortnightin New York it now lasts for ten days or thereabouts we are toldthough it is clear that no certainty at taches to any fixed period in this connection There is reason to believe that the great ma jority of adults and many children may be in fected with the virus without being a penny the worse for it either because the virus is en feebled or because the resistance of such in dividuals is high Thus it is probable that every patient actually ill with the disease has in his immediate environment a number of mild and abortive cases of infantile paralysis that escape observation or detection and diag nosis and also a still larger number of per fectly healthy people who are all carriers 6f the infecting agent and therefore potential sources of infection to others It would seem as if all these persons developed a relatively high de gree of immunity to the virus a fact which may explain the comparative immunity of European towns or villages visited by epi demics of infantile paralysis to the occurrence of further epidemics during the next few years In fact as with cerebrospinal menin gitis the number of the carriers of the infec tion may be much larger in infantile paralysis than the number of the victims of an epidemic of that diseaseThe

management of the Naples Zoolog ical Station and its proposed future disposi tiona subject that will be of interest to the readers of SCIENCE In the train of events following May 1815 R Dohrn director of the station and all the German personnel departed The zoological station was taken over by the Italian govern ment The management was placed under the administration of a special commission com posed of Professor F S Monticelli of the University of Naples Professor L De Marchi of the University of Padua and Comm G Biraghi department chief of the Ministry of Education Professor Monticelli was made president of the commission This commis sion then appointed Professor U Pierantoni of the University of Naples director of the zoological section of the station Professor F Bottazzi of the University of Naples director of the physiological section and some other assistants By a decree May 26 1918 the commission placed the station under the auspices of the Ministry of Education as an autonomous in stitution and by another decree June 9 1918 the statute compiled by the commission itself was approved and now governs the ad ministrative management of the station The part of the statute which concerns the scientific management of the station has aroused objections from those interested in the physiology and physiological chemistry sec tions as there was a feeling that in time these two sections would be overshadowed With out going into the details of the discussion of this portion of the statute for the formation of which the president of the commission seems to have been solely responsible it suffices toN S VOL LII NO 1345 say that at present the main objection is the method of appointing the scientific staff and of apportioning the appropriations among the different sections The director of the sta tion who according to the now existing statute must be a zoologist has sole control of the recommendation for the appointment and discharge of the entire scientific staff assistants and other attendants and also makes recommendations for the financing of the station The station is nowand has been since the approval of the decree by the commission June 1918under the direct supervision of the Ministry of Education This is a tempo rary arrangement and will continue until June 1921 A committee of eleven has lately been ap pointed to formulate a plan for the future or ganization of the station Of these three never took part and two others were called away on urgent business after the beginning of the deliberations Of the six who partici pated in the discussion fiveProfessor V Vol terra Rome Professor P Del Pezzo Naples Professor D Carazzi Florence Professor F Bottazzi Naples and Comm Martini of the Ministry of Educationmade a majority report May 1920 with oneProfessor F S Monticellidissenting The committee recommend that the zoolog ical station be an autonomous institution open to Italian and foreign investigators alike They also recommend that the state provide an annual subsidiary for the maintenance of the station to be divided as recommended by the commission between the Ministry of Educa tion the Committee on Oceanography and the Ministry of Agriculture all of which are in terested in the future welfare of the station The station would thus be of the same char acter as other autonomous institutions having an organization which would presuppose its administrative and scientific autonomy and at the same time the Italian government would support it with annual appropriations Each contributing organization of the state would reserve a given number of tables for its in vestigators The committee also recommend that the rules and regulations now in force be retained and changes be made only where necessary to carry out the plans as set forth in the report The most important change is that in the statute relating to the appointment of the director of the station and the scientific personnel The committee recommend modifications that will guarantee the stability and welfare of all the sections of the station The scientific per sonnel is to be placed on the same footing as that of civil employees of the state The essential points of the statute recom mended by the committee can be briefly stated 1 The station is to beas approved by the decree of May 26 1918an autonomous insti tution for the investigation of marine biology open alike and on the same basis to Italians and foreigners 2 The station is to have the full control and the use of all funds and property belonging to it as proclaimed by the municipality of Naples July 30 1917 3 The sources of income are to be a Appropriations of the Ministry of Edu cation b Appropriations of the Committee on Oceanography c Appropriations of the Ministry of Agri culture d Appropriations of the Municipality of Naples e Proceeds of public contributions and from Italian and foreign institutions f Proceeds from the fees of admission to the public aquarium g Proceeds from tables secured by Ital ians and foreigners for study h All other sources 4 The station will administer its own funds 5 The station is to have a council of ad ministration composed thus a Three members appointed by the mu nicipality of Naples The mayor is president ex officio b Three members appointed by the Min istry of Education 324 SCIENCEOCTOBER 8 1920 SCIENCE c Three members appointed by the Com mittee on Oceanography d One member appointed by the Ministry of Agriculture e The director of the station This council is to have charge of the financ ing and the administration of the station 6 Each regular contributor will be allowed to take part in the administration of the sta tion and according to the rules of the statute will be given tables in proportion to the con tribution 7 The director legally represents the sta tion and is responsible to the council of ad ministration 8 The station is composed of sections of zoology physiology and physiological chemis try The council of administration has the power to organize other sections within cer tain specifications 9 The scientific staff is composed of the di rectors of the various sections of the station the assistants and librarian I 10 The directors of the different sections are chosen through competing examinations following the general rules governing the uni versity competing examinations and special regulations to be fixed in the statute From these the council of administration selects one as director of the station The director of the station serves for three years and may be re appointed These will constitute the scientific council The scientific council provides for the regulation of the station and collaborates in the preparation of the budget pertaining to the financial needs of single sections 11 The assistants and librarian will be ap pointed by the council of administration ac cording to the rules to be fixed by the statute The council of administration also has charge of the appointment of all other of the station personnel I 12 The personnel according to 10 consti tuting the scientific staff must devote their entire time to the work of the station The same laws governing civil employees will apply to them As the writer understands it these proposed changes will not prohibit private subscriptions for tables by either Italian or foreign institu tions and such tables may be taken as in pre war times EDWIN B POWERS DEPARTMENT OP ZOOLOGY UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA

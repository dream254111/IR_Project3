communicated to the Society entitled  Experimen tal Researches on Electricity Third Series by Michael Faraday Esq DCL FRS MRI the reading of which was deferred tothe next Meeting The Society then adjourned over the Christmas Vacation to meet again on the 10th of January January 10 1833 JOHN WILLIAM LUBBOCK Esq MA VP and Treasurer in the Chair The reading of Mr Faradays paper communicated at the last Meeting and entitled  Experimental Researches on Electricity Third Series was commenced January 17 1833 MARK ISAMBARD BRUNEL Esq VicePresident in the Chair The reading of Mr Faradays paper was resumed and concluded The object of the inquiries of which an account is given in the pre sent paper is to establish the identity of the electricities derived from different sources The author was induced to investigate this sub ject because doubts have been frequently expressed as to the accu racy of some experiments from which the identity of common and voltaic electricities is inferred  and distinctions have been drawn between them as if they were different forms and modifications of one common power In order to examine the question in all its bearings he arranges the phenomena under two general heads  namely those arising from electricity in a state of equilibrium or tension as it has been called  and those which are the consequence of its motion when that equilibrium has been destroyed The visible effects of electricity of tension are attractions or repulsions at sensible distances j those of electricity in motion are the evolution of heat the production of magnetism chemical decompositions physiological changes and lastly the evolution of light in the form of a spark The author proves by experiments that every one of these phaeno mena takes place from the operation either of ordinary or of voltaic electricity  the degree in which they are produced depending on the different circumstances of quantity of intensity and of velocity at tendant on the different modes in which electricity has been excited and supplied Thus no difference was found to exist in the mode in which a Leyden battery charged with ordinary electricity and a vol taic battery were discharged when the comparison was made by means of fine points nicely arranged and approximated either through air of the ordinary temperature or through heated air such as the flame of a spiritlamp interposed between the points By the term current the author designates any progressive change of whatever nature itmay be in the electric state whether consisting162 in the motion of one electric fluid in a particular direction or of two fluids in contrary directions  and by the term arrangement he under stands a local adjustment of particles or fluids or forces not pro gressive By ordinary electricity he understands that which can be obtained from the common electrical machine or from the atmosphere or by pressure or cleavage of crystals or similar mechanical operations 5 its character being that of great intensity and the exertion of attrac tive and repulsive forces not merely at small but also at considerable distances The parallel between voltaic and ordinary electricity is then pursued by the production of evidence that those attractions and repulsions which were thought to characterize the latter are exhibited also by the former and that on the other hand ordinary electricity when in motion gives rise to an increase of temperature to magnetic phenomena to chemical decompositions to physiological impressions and to luminous appearances precisely ofthe same kind as those which had been supposed to be the peculiar effects of voltaic electricity The experiments of Mr Colladon which seemed to show that a stream of common electricity has power to produce the deflexion ofa magneta conclusion which has hitherto rested on the single testimony of that experimentalisthave been repeated and extended by Mr Faraday who completely confirms their accuracy and the truth of the result that had been obtained from them The author succeeded in making common electricity assume more of the charac ters of voltaic electricity by availing himself of the retarding power of bad conductors interposed in the electric circuit In this way he easily succeeded in obtaining the same decisive evidence of chemical action by common electricity as Dr Wollaston had done in his expe riment But Mr Faraday considers the experiment in which water is decomposed by this power as affording no proof of electrochemical agency because as Dr Wollaston had pointed out both oxygen and hydrogen are evolved at each of the points of the interrupted circuit and not separately at the respective poles The author re gards the amount of electrochemical decomposition as being pro portional not to the intensity but to the quantity of electricity trans mitted It is not effected by electricity passed from the machine in sparks although these tend to decompose water into its constituent elements Some experiments of Bonijol on the decomposition of water by atmospherical electricity are commented on by the author who considers them as analogous to the experiment of Dr Wollaston already referred to Mr Faraday also makes some remarks upon Mr Barrys paper in the Philosophical Transactions for 1831 and suggests doubts of thesoundness of the inferences he draws from his experiments The author then proceeds to examine the electrical phenomena elicited by magnetoelectricity and shows that as far as they have been observed they coincide with those of voltaic electricity and consequently are referrible to the same agency The only effects that have not been yet obtained are chemical decompositions The quan tities of thermoelectricity that can be elicited in ordinary cases are163 too small to produce any effects but those of magnetism and also muscular contractions in the limbs of frogs The animal electricity of the torpedo produces most of the effects of voltaic electricity ex cepting the evolution of heat and light The general conclusion de duced by the author from these researches is that electricity what ever beits source is perfectly identical in its nature In the concluding chapter of the present paper the author endea vours to establish some relation by measure between common and voltaic electricity He shows by experiment that whenever the same absolute quantity of electricity whatever be its intensity passes through the galvanometer the deflecting force exerted upon the magnetic needle is invariably the same Hence this deflecting force may be taken as the measure of the absolute quantity o transmitted electri city  a principle which establishes the value ofthe galvanometer as an instrument of measurement in all cases of electricity in motion The power of chemical decomposition he finds to be also directly as the quantity of transmitted electricity

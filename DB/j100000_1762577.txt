behalf of the Confederacy and he was thrown with men like Tennyson Carlyle Gladstone IJickens Thackeray and many others of whom he gives entertaining reminiscences and anecdotes Lincoln L Eyres article on  Corporate Suretyship  is interesting and valuable NOTES AND NEWS THE topographic work of the arid lands and irrigation survey has been completed at the United States Geological Survey in Washington ancl all tlle parties to be employed this year are already in the field The hydrographic branch involves some very difficult scientific problems the solution Df which may cause some delay Among these are the discovery of a method that shall be more ac curate than any now employed to measure the volume of water that passes through a river This is probably among the simplest of the problems Another is a means of ascertaining the amount of sediment a river carries and a third is the invention of some method of determining the annual amount of evaporation from the surfaces of the proposed reservoirs General Greely in his annual report says that the percentages of successful weatherpredictions made by the signal office for the yearwere 784 wind 755 temperature 742 general average 767 The number of coldwave signals displayed was l743 of which l240 or 7IS per cent were verified Vr Theodore Gill at the meeting of the Washington Biologi cal Society last Saturday evening read a paper on  The Families of Fishes He said that in I872 after eleven years study of the subject he published a list of the families of fishes numbering 244 Subsequent studies have increased this numberto 300 Cuvier rec ognized only 30 At the same meeting Dr Gill defended his use of the suffix  ida  to the Greek or Latin root to designate a family instead of  atida the one used by naturalists for a century He read letters from the most distinguished Greek and Latin scholars in the country asserting that ida  was grammatically the only proper form The members of the society who discussed the sub ject were not convinced by Dr Gills arguments and authorities  Sexual Characteristics of the Lachnosternis  was the title of a paper read by Mr J B Smith of the Department of Agriculture before the Washington Biological Society at its meeting last Satur day evening It described a study by the author last summer of the Junebug about which strange to say entomologists before knew comparatively little The study resulted in the identlfication among the many thousands of specimens captured in the District of Columbia of four strongly marked welldeSned species the female as well as the male of each species being determined In a pamphlet  GreatCircle Sailing published by Long mans Green  Co Richard A Proctor advocates the use of the stereographic polar projection for laying out the shortest sea routes As is well known the gnomonic projection is used for finding the great circle between tszo points that are not too far dis tant from each other As this projection however does not allow the representation of more than about onethird of the earthvs sur face it is not suitable for finding the great circle between points that are tar apart Proctor uses the property of the stereographic projection that each circle on the sphere is projected into a circle which may be constructed on the map with great ease Thus by laying a circle through two points and one of their antipodes the shortest route between the two points is found A similar con struction permits the finding of the shortest route whichdoes not cross a certain degree of latitude beyond which natigation would be dangerous Two maps of the earth are constructedone in south polar projection the other in north polar projectionand each is adapted to construct routes in one hemisphere Prof Dr Paulsen of the University of Berlin Germany in a letter in regard to the Berlitz schools of languages says The method of Mr Berlitz appears to me as far as I have had the op portunity of familiarizing myself

essentially in introducing the foreign tongtle as a living tongue drilling It from the very beginning by ear and speech instead of teaching it by reading and writingfi like at deafmute language During the instruction the pupil hears and speaks only the lan guage he is to learn The effect of this is first that he is enabled to follow without diRSculty even rapid conversation in the foreign tongue and seconds that he thoroughly acquires the pronurlcia tion as well as the srarious expressions usecl in forming an assertion question or command Whether the method can be employed in the instruction of large publicschool classes I am not yet able to state It appears to me however beyond doubt that the method is specially adapted to advance rapidly adults who desire to study a modern language for practical application But I arrl also in clined to believe that its useJ at least supplementary to the orclinary publicschool course is practicable even in large classes proxrided the teacher himself can converse in the language to be taught It would be apt above all to reawaken the pupils interestJ so easily blunted by grammatical exercises and translations Really the method is only the systernatized form of learning a foreign lan guage in a foreign country by its actual use LETTERS TO THE EDITOR  Take Heed   MAY I be aIlowed to draw attention to an expression that is now creeping into our textbooks and journals Every teacher of chemistry is aware that students when endeavoring to describe experiments prefix to almost every sentence the word  take  Zake a glass cylinder replies the student when asked to de scribe the method by which hydrogen is collected fill it with water and invert it in a vessel filled with water Then take a glass tube arld put the end of it under the mouth of the cylinder Then when the cylinder is full take a glass plate and put it on the end of the cylinder and take it out of the water etc The careful teacher would interrupt this laborious and inz7olved description at the start by suggesting the more concise statement 4 Invert a jar filled with water etc Indeed it is quite remarkable how students when drilled by good teachers soon fall into the way of expressing their ideas concisely and accurately but it is dis couraging in reading articles written by men of high standing to find directions beginning  Take a jar  Take a tube Time is short life is short and our sciences are getting to be endless Let us therefore discourage all verbosity and inaccuracy and eIlcourage simplicity and terseness of expression Let the teacher when the student begins his ramble by saying 4 Well you take salt manga nese dioxide and strong sulphuric acid to which some water has been added stop him gently but firmly with 44 I will roX  I am willing to teach chemistry for a small salary and to sacrifice myself in the irlterest of science but I must draw the line somewhere and I draw it here I will no take salt manganese dioxide and strong sulphuric acid to which some water has been added Let evert one be on his guard against the ravages of this word PETER T AUSTEN New Brunswick NJ Oct IS Ants transplallting the ScaleBug IN bringing in from outside the window the other day some pots of agave infested with scalebug I placed one of these near a hox of plants Next day I noticed some red ants engaged at something on the point of one of the leaves On examining more closelyJ I found three allts bringing scalebugs from off a dying leaf of an agave to the leaf of a plant which it barely touched They incited the slow bugs to move along by touching them with their antenna and in the course of half a day they had transplanted several of the halfgrown insects I am pretty sure from the circumstances that they were doing this and I hardly think the scale could have crossed aIone from the position of the leaves I question if the scale gives up its honey by excitation like the aphis I am inclined to believe that they deposit the drops of beautifully clear viscid honey at night The ants do associate with the scale for the pur pose of gathering this product and have nests at the base of each plant suffering from scale The ants have been in my office for more than Iour years and I have come to the conclusion that in my fight with the scale they aid and abet the enemy There is one circumstance that reconciles me to the ants they search out and destroy the larv of museum pests A deerskin coat infested with moth was thrown on the floor one day and after a little while I noticed some ants crossing and Trurrowing in the hair in the most excited manner ancl I also noticed some ants car rying away and devoulXing the plump white mothlarv they had secured I have seen them carrying the struggling 4 millers alsoe WALTER HO UGH U S National Museum Oct I6 ChestDevelopment I AM glad to say the practical experience of another year has completely confirmed the research I laid before the British Assocla tion at Birmingham and Manchester The best type of chest has been easily obtained in young people but anthlopologists willS no doubt be surprised to learn that a change in the same direction can with care be made in those of matureage This I have seerl in the diseased chest of a gentleman aged thirtyseven 13etween the ages of twentyfive and thirtythree similar results have beerb frequently noted Here are facts that prove the direct power of the surroundings in making the dfferent types of chest we meet with and consequently we can now avoid those types that are known to be so injurious to the race by substituting for them that which we find at birth No doubt the proportion between the height and chestgirth that obtains at birth is a very high one so rrluch sos an fact that it has been thought that I was acting unadvisedly in selecting it as the standard we ought to seek to attain But it ex ists and Mr Brents maximum chestgirthS obtainecl from a large nutnber of actual measurements over forty years ago closely agrees with it The method of treatment advocated in the paper on consump tion has been successfully applied in six cases One whose chest girth has increased about five inches and whose vital capacity ex ceeds Hutchinsons socalled standard of health by seventy cubic inches has passed medical examination for lifeassurance a secondt whose chestgirth has increased nearly three inches has been examined by a physician who detected no signs of the pre vious dasease a third whose vital capacity was eightyfive cubic inches and now is two hundred and twentycubic inches has borne children and continues welly and most satisfactory progress has been made in the others To these we must add Sydenhams cures and the numerous recoveries by nature which were obtaaned by similar conditions Hence the practical application of this method has completely confirmed the explanation I gave of the nature of the disease and I have no doubt whatever that science has gaaned another victory in the conquest of a great enemy of civil ized man G W HADABLETON Dorchester Place Blandford Square London Oct II Queries 37 WHAT NUMBERS DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE A BILLION  During colonial times both in England and the Colonies it took one million of millions to make a billion During the first half of the present century I think it may be affirmed that this notation had not been changed and would have been held binding in law in the United States It is certainly the most convenient for the as tronomerw who has to deal with such enormous distances The nearest of the twelve or fourteen fixed stars whose distances are approximately known to us require twenty thirty or forty English billions of miles to measure the space between the earth and them The compilers of our modern American arithmetics without any legislation on the subject seem to have disregarded the old nota tions and to have adopted the French method of calling in numbers a thotlsand millions a billion It is true that the French metric system has been legalized but it does not make a kilometre ar English mile E T MERRICK New Orleans La OCt I3

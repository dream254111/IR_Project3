breeders first the possibility of increasing the oilcontent 5 North Amer Fauna No 28 April t7 1909 pp 52 53 66 69 and 70 in the seeds of lintbearing varieties and second the breeding of a lintless cotton to be grown strictly as a seedcrop In asking the first question it is assumed that the oil might be increased without reducing the lint while the second is prompted by the idea that lint less varieties could be harvested by machinery thus avoiding the chief difficulty and expense in the production of fiber the labor of picking the cotton by hand Increasing the oil in cotton seed was under taken several years ago in connection with the breeding of the Trice variety A large amount of careful work was done by Professor S M Bain of the University of Tennessee as sisted by the late Mr Albert T Anders for merly of the Bureau of Plant Industry but without finding the definite differences that were sought as the basis of selection for oil content The fluctuations induced by condi tions of growth or associated with various de grees of maturity attained by the seeds were so large as to conceal inherent differences of in dividual plants or progenies As might be ex pected from the greater proportion of kernel to shell the oilcontent seems to be higher in varieties with large seeds more than 24 per cent of oil or 64 gallons per ton of seed be ing reported for the Meade cotton in Georgia but largeseeded varieties are unpopular be cause they do not have the highest percentages of lint The breeding of lintless varieties might not prove difficult since individual plants with entirely naked seeds have been found as chance variations in lintbearing stocks Degenerate  slickseeded  plants with little or no fuzz on the seeds and only a sparse covering of lint are of rather common occurrence in the South eastern States in ordinary short staple fields raised from  ginrun  seed Some of the in ferior Hindi variations of the Egyptian type of cotton have nearly naked seeds Fail ure to eliminate the Hindi admixture in Egypt damages the crop to the extent of several million dollars every year A lintless cotton would need to be excluded rigorously from any region where other varieties are grown The seed must become much more valuable than 167N S VOL XLVIII No 1233 it even now is before overtaking the value of the lint especially in long staple varieties No compensating increase in the yield of seed is to be expected from a lintless cotton the fiber being merely cellulose like the woody tissues of the plant Picking a lintless cotton by hand would be out of the question because the seeds fall out as soon as the bolls open but possibilities of avoiding this difficulty have been suggested by the fact that all varieties do not open the bolls to the same extent or with equal readiness Certain foreign cottons have nearly indehis cent capsules as have some of the relatives of cotton including the okra plant which could be grown as a seed crop Other factors that affect the opening of cotton bolls are heat and dryness Fullgrown bolls of Kekehi cotton remained fresh and apparently unchanged for nearly six months in a greenhouse experiment and yet opened normally when the plants were taken outside and allowed to dry The failure of bolls to open in cool autumn weather which now appears as a danger or limiting factor of cotton culture in some parts of California might be an advantage if harvesting by machinery were practicable In considering the possibility of utilizing lateopening cotton in California it seemed that two kinds of machines would be needed The first machine might be thought of as a modified cornbinder that would cut or pull the plants and at the same time press and tie them into loose bundles or small bales not too large to be handled easily nor too dense to dry without rotting The bundles could be kept rather narrow since the form of the plants can be controlled by methods of spacing and thinning that have been worked out The stalks would be in the middle of the bundle while most of the bolls would be on the outside so that gradual drying and normal opening might be expected As the plants would be pressed flat in the bundles they should come out in convenient shape for running into another machine for picking the seed cotton from the bolls Rela tively slight adaptations of existing types of picking machinery might serve the problem in this form being much simpler than that of picking cotton from live plants in the field which many inventors have attempted to solve Gumming of the machinery and staining of the fiber with the plant juices would be avoided as well as the difficulties of operating and repairing very complicated machines in the field That machine picking could produce grades equal to those of cotton picked carefully by hand is hardly to be expected although the quality might not be seriously impaired if admixture with weak immature fiber can be avoided This might be possible in parts of California where the bolls are not likely to be frozen though the leaves may be killed Cleaners and gins could be operated in con nection with stationary picking machines and utilization of the stalks for papermaking or other industrial purposes would become more feasible Leaving the fields clear at the end of the season would facilitate the planting of other crops and might have advantages in relation to pests or diseases Even with cotton considered as a seedcrop the possibili ties of mechanical harvesting do not appear to depend upon the breeding of lintless va rieties Special characters conditions or ap pliances that might be expected to facilitate the harvesting of lintless cotton seem likely to be more useful in connection with lintbear ing varieties 0 F

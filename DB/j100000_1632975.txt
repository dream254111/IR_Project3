j100000,Science,1632975,Toxicity as a Factor in the Productive Capacity of Soils,i296017,DISCUSSION ANYD CORRESPONDENYCE TOXICITY AS A FACTOR IN THE PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY OF SOILS THE U S Department of Agriculture in 1903 promulgated through its Bureau of Soils in Bulletin 22 the teaching 1 that practically all agricultural soils contain suffi cient plant food for good crop yields and that this supply will be indefinitely maintained 2 that not only is the soil moisture a natural nutritive solution but that it has sen sibly the same concentration in productive and unproductive soils 3 that this concentra tion is by natural processes constantly main tained of sufficient strength to meet the needs of crops giving good yields and 4 that the good effects observed in all parts of the world to follow the practise of proper rotation of crops the application of stable and green manures and of mineral fertilizers must be due to some other mode of action than that of supplying the crop on the ground with needed additional plant food During the four years since the publication of these views the Bureau of Soils has de voted much of its time energy and funds to an attempt to show 1 that crops excrete through their surfaces and leave in the soils or upon the feld toxic substances which when tilth and climatic conditions are riglht are the chief cause of reduced yields and runout lands and 2 that proper crop rotations stable and green manures and mineral fertilizers owe their observed good effects on crop yields to destroying or removing these toxic principles rather than to contributing plant food to the crops In the support and promnulgation of these views there have now been published four other bulletins from the Bureau of Soils and one circular from the office of the Secretary of Agriculture in reply to adverse criticisms made upon them It is the purpose here to discuss broadly but concisely what basis there may be for these views Amount of Plant Food Carried by Soils When no distinction is made between the amount of plant food proper and the amount of the elements and substances from whichAPRIL 17 1908 SCIENCE 627 plant food may be derived there is no doubt but that the amount present even in the poorest soils is very large when measured in units of yearly crop demands But the amount is not so large either absolutely or in the rate of renewal by rock weathering as to be inexhaustible if only it could be made con tinuously available at the rate required for good yields Indeed the untruth of an as sertion that by establishing good mechanical facilities for a high rate of removal of coal and thorough sanitary conditions for the miners the supply of coal in a given mine will be indefinitely maintained is no more certain than the contention that by a proper rotation of crops and the maintenance of good tilth and proper sanitary conditions uniformly large yields may be indefinitely maintained on any and all fields without a return to the soil of the plant food removed We have in Wisconsin residuary soils whose absolute con tent of potassium is only 46 tons of calcium 53 tons of magnesium 3 tons of nitrogen 9 ton and of phosphorus 8 ton per acrefoot of field But it is very important to recognize that by very far the larger proportion of these plant food elements existing in the soil is properly speaking no more to be regarded as plant food for the crop growing upon the ground than it is food for the cattle feeding upon pasture grass hence there is never pres ent in the soil of a field any such large amounts of plant food proper as have been stated But considering these amounts as capable of being converted into plant food proper as rapidly as large yields of crops would demand the whole amount of the phosphorus finds its equivalent measure in the amount carried in 268 and the whole of the potassium in but 634 20bushelperacre crops of wheat allowing nothing for losses by leaching And yet the rate of surface erosion which will expose un cropped material from below as rapidly as one foot in 4000 years could supply phosphorus only one fifteenth and potassium one sixth as fast as would be demanded by the 20bushel crops of wheat It follows therefore that for the soil in question to have a productive capacity of 20 bushels per acre per annum indefinitely maintained without the applica tion of phosphorus and potassium the rate of surface erosion and of subsoll and rock weathering must equal one foot in every 268 years for the phosphorus and one in every 634 for the potassium But these are rates seldom if ever experienced in any agricultural region and the mean rate of erosion for the whole Mississippi Valley has been placed by geolo gists at not more than one foot in 4000 to 6000 years Natures method of developing and of main taining the productive capacity of fields has always been that of returning to the soil the whole crop but even so nowhere has the concentration of the mineral elements of plant food been large as a result of soil formation by rock weathering under plant growth The reverse rather has been the rule and very em phatically so with lime and magnesia Only organic matter with its ash has at times and places accumulated to form peat and coal but always under nonagricultural conditions There appears therefore no ground for a dif ference of opinion as to the point that it is possible for a mere rotation of crops coupled with good tillage and ample and timely moisture supply to indefinitely maintain high yields where the whole crop above ground is regularly and continually removed from the field Concentration of Soil Solutions Notwithstanding the contention made in Bulletin 22 of the Bureau of Soils and reiter ated in later publications from the same office that all soil solutions have essentially the same concentration it must nevertheless be admitted that no observations yet published can be re garded as indicating even the approximate concentration of a single soil solution as it exists in the soil and functions in the growth of plants under field greenhouse or pot culture conditions It must further be admitted that the water solutions which have been recovered from soils do show a very wide range in both composition and concentration when judged by any standard admissible from the cultural point of view It is of the greatest importance in the con628 SCIENCE N S VOL XXVII No 694 sideration of this question to recognize the fact that neither the water solutions decanted from soil samples the water filtered through soil nor the solutions separated from field soil by either natural drainage or a centrifuge represent either the relative composition or the concentration of the portion remaining behind in contact with the soil The only conclusion which is warranted based upon existing pub lished data regarding the concentration of soil solutions as they exist under field plant house and pot culture conditions is that they are certainly an undetermined amount stronger than would be indicated by the observed con centrations of solutions recovered thus far from soils under such cultural conditions It had been demonstrated in the laboratory of the Bureau of Soils before the data pre sented in Bulletin 22 had been obtained that when a coarse thoroughly acidcleaned and washed sand known to contain 8471 parts per million of NO3 in so soluble a form as potas sium nitrate was washed three minutes in twice its weight of water only 737 per cent of the actual amount present was recovered in the first washing and after ten consecutive similar washings there was still retained in the moisture films closely investing the sand grains 1802 per cent of the original amount given to the sand which amount was subse quently recovered after rendering the sand waterfree After the sixth washing in this experiment the strength of successive solu tions became constant at 11 part per million of NO the concentration standing as below 1 washing  31210 p m 2 washings 3284 3   452 4   174 5   138 6   128 7   111 8  110 9   110 10   110  Schreiner and Failyer in Bulletin 32 Bu reau ef Soils have since published similar results working with very soluble phosphates and potassium chloride in connection with several soils The simplest explanation for results like these is to suppose that these salts are retained in solution within the stationary films investing the sand and soil grains and that the salts recovered by successive wash ings after the concentrations become constant measure the rate of outward diffusion from the stationary film into the free water But the Bureau of Soils holds and presumably the authors of Bulletin 32 that the fact that after prolonged leaching of soils with pure water the filtrate appears to attain a constant concentration furnishes direct proof in sup port of the contention that all soil solutions have a concentration sensibly the same the thought being that certain amounts of the salts experimented with had been absorbed by the soils which were later redissolved by the excess of water on its passage over the soil grain surfaces It is to be observed however that in the case of the solutions and soils re ported upon by Schreiner the salts retained even in the case of phosphates had not be come sufficient to make the retained water a saturated solution under conditions not affected by the soil surface action It must therefore be admitted we think that the data of Bulletin 32 lends little support such as is being eagerly sought in defense of the views of Bulletin 22 to wit that in all cultivable soils the moisture is a nutritive solution hav ing sensibly the same concentration So far is this view from being a demon strated fact that if the data presented in Bulletin 22 in support of it be admitted in evidence quite the reverse proposition must be counted proved by nearly every table there presented To illustrate The data on pages 31 32 and 33 show a range of soluble phos phoric acid varying from 12 parts per million of soil moisture to 203 parts per million sup posing the water content in each soil sample to be 20 per cent computed on the dry soil That this wide range in concentration is not due to exceptional cases is made clear by arranging the data of this table in an ascend ing series averaging in groups of ten to re duce errors and unusual irregularities we get the following series of concentrations 168 288 372 417 454 503 546 598 643 706APRIL 17 1908 SCIENCE 629 867 and 1658 the last average containing but four analyses  This table here referred to contains only analyses of a single soil type known as Cecil clay as it occurs in the vicinity of Statesville N C and instead of indicating that all soil solutions have the same concentration if it proves anything it shows that even one and the same soil type as mapped by the Bu reau of Soils may carry solutions of phos phoric acid ranging all the way from 16 to 165 parts per million if indeed not from 12 to 203 parts But from what has been demonstrated re garding potassium nitrate from clean sand and indeed from the data presented in Bul letin 32 referred to above there is every reason to think that the first threeminute washing to which these soil samples were sub jected should not be expected to give a solution which would indicate the true concentration of the fixed water films investing the soil gran ules and soil grains and which must be regarded functional in root feeding and hence the true difference between the extremes in this series of soil samples should be expected to be much greater than that observed During the year of preliminary studies re garding the nature and concentration of soil solutions preceding the collection of the data presented in Bulletin 22 a very carefully selected series of samples of soils was taken by the writer from 67 localities covering 41 of the bureaus soil types distributed in seven states each sample being always a composite of four cores taken with the soil tube instead of with the auger The total water soluble salt content in the surface foot of 66 samples from these soil types were determined by the gravimetric method the residues being dried at 1100 C before weighing These results showed an extreme variation ranging from 105 parts per million of soil solution computed to a moisture content of 20 per cent of the dry soil to as high as 1962 parts and when this series of determinations is arranged in an ascending order and the analyses averaged in groups of ten the concentrations stand 2395 4181 5468 6737 810 950 and 1530 parts per million and when these differences are shown with only threeminute washings in water equal to five times the weight of the soil in its fresh normal field condition a liter of the solution being evaporated in each case it is difficult to understand how such data originating in the bureau should have been ignored in drawing conclusions so at variance with the experimental records In the case of the phosphoric acid for this series which was determined for each of the surface four feet separately and the data published in Bulletin 26 of the bureau the extreme range of phos phates is from 164 to 3956 parts per million and when grouped and averaged in tens as in previous cases the results are 364 665 965 1243 1757 2673 and 3556 parts per about 4000000 of dry soil In Bulletin 26 there are also given data from various sources regard ing drainage waters from England analyzed by Way Frankland and Voeleker all of which show strong differences in the concentration of soil moisture as it leaves natural field soil by way of underdrains It must be conceded therefore that there is no good foundation in observation or indeed from a priori considera tions for the contention that all soil solutions have essentially the same composition and con centration when viewed from the standpoint of their function in plant growth Soluble Salt Content of Soils in Relation to Yield of Crops It is further contended from data presented in Bulletin 22 that there is no apparent rela tion between the yield of crops and the soluble salt content of soils and the statement is quite true when thus based But it should be gen erally understood that were the converse of this contention very strongly marked such data as are collected and presented in Bulletin 22 must be expected to fail utterly to reveal the fact These are the facts regarding the data used 1 Assumed not measured yields of crops form the basis of comparison 2 single and isolated soil samples for determination are taken to reveal field conditions which they seldom do closely 3 much of the chemical work was done outside the laboratory under conditions prohibitive of the necessary accu racy 4 duplicate solutions prepared from4630 SCIENCE N S VOL XXVII No 694 the same sample of soil are recorded as differ ing by as much as 638 and 1234 parts per million for P04 315 and 2339 for NO3 943 and 1533 for K It would be strange indeed if under such conditions anything but a medley of results were secured But the results of a whole season of much more critical and reliable work along these lines which preceded the gathering of the data in Bulletin 22 and a second years work fol lowing this still more critical and exhaustive are left out of consideration wholly in reach ing the conclusion under discussion The first years work referred to pointed strongly to the conclusion that where other conditions of growth are equally favorable the largest yields of crops are not only associated with the soils yielding the largest amount of watersoluble salts but that the sap of crops growing on such soils is also richer in the same salts In other words it had been shown that on soils from which the largest amounts of water soluble salts could be recovered more of the same salts were carried in the sap of the plants growing upon these soils and the data may be found in Bulletin No 26 of the Bureau of Soils in which the letter of transmittal acknowledges the accuracy of the data but rejects the conclusions drawn therefrom The second years work whose results are throughout in accord with those of the first year show the following relation between yields and the watersoluble salts which had been recovered from eight soil types upon which two crops were grown to maturity under normal field conditions and where the yields were accurately determined by weighing The soil types used were selected with a view to having those of different productive capacity and four of those were rather above and the other four rather below the average of good soils Taking the yields and the watersoluble salts recovered from the poorer soils as 100 the relations found are as stated below Four Four Poor Good Soils Soils NPK in samples once washed 100 1885 NPK in  11 times    100 1931 Yield of shelled corn  100 1917 Yield of potatoes 100 2714 It is here clear that there is a marked in crease in yield both of corn and of potatoes where the watersoluble salts carrying nitro gen phosphorus and potassium are present in largest removable amounts whether this is shown by one or by eleven washings of the same sample Not only was this strongly marked relation shown to exist when the soils are thus grouped but four equal areas of each of the eight soil types were treated to 300 pounds of guano and other fours to 5 10 and 15 tons of stable manure respectively and the differences in re coverable water soluble salts determined throughout the season together with the yields of corn and potatoes with the results given below In this table each value is a mean from 32 field plots Soluble Yield of Yield of N  P  K Corn Potatoes No fertilization  100 100 100 300 pounds guano 1031 1105 1172 5 tons manure 1068 1209 1317 10   1097 1359 1419 15    1135 1400 1574 It is thus here shown that with each in crease in the amount of the three plant food elements which could be recovered from the soil there was a regular and corresponding in crease in the yield of each of the two crops the gain in the corn being almost directly pro portional to the increase of the three plant food elements recovered by water from the soil With data thus strongly indicating larger yields associated with increasing amounts of watersoluble salts recovered from the soil collected before the data of Bulletin 22 and confirmed by a second year of still more critical work the whole work is ignored and the reverse relation held to be demonstrated by data of the character stated Soluble Salt Content in Soils Constantly Maintained This is another of the contentions woven into the fabric of Bulletin 22 but without basis in recorded data other than that spread upon its pages in the form of analyses of some Rothamsted soils which are offered to introduce the statement that the decreasingAPRIL 17 1908 SCIENCE 631 yield from the continuously unmanured wheat plot has not been due to a loss of water soluble material or rather that there has beeih no permanent disturbance of the solution equilibrium and concentration citing espe cially the bureaus analyses of soils from plots 3 and 11 of the Broadbalk field Such data are given in evidence utterly ignoring the detailed full and careful data published from the Rothamsted laboratories pointing strongly to the very opposite conclusion as may be seen from the tables Bulletin 26 Bureau of Soils pp 23 24 80 83 The detailed analyses of the soil solutions leaving the Rothamsted plots as drainage water show that that from the plot continuously unfertilized are not only the least concentrated of any in the whole series of 16 plots but that the total solids in solution from this plot stand as 2464 to 4259 coming from plot 11 or as 100 to 173 while the relative mean yields of wheat stand as 100 to 215 Moreover there is a remarkable and clear relation between the yields of nearly all of the plots of this series and the concentration of the drainage water leaving the respective plots the yields generally in creasing with the soluble salt content of the drainage water Not only is this true for the total soluble salt content but the amount of potash carriedi in the drainage water coming from the plots to which potash fertilizers have been continuously applied when compared with that from those td which none has been given stands in the ratio of 425 to 100 as an average and there is no individual excoption Such in brief is the character of the data spread out by Whitney and Cameron in Bul letin 22 Thus did they ignore pertinent undoubted facts collected by the bureau or published elsewhere tending to disprove their views Such is the almost utter lack of evi dence collected either by the bureau or by others which may fairly be placed in support of their main contentions and yet no work has since been done or at least published which can be placed in support of these views On the contrary the energy of the bureau is being expended in an effort to accumulate data in support of the theory that poor and runout lands are so because of the accumula tion in them of imaginary toxic substances Bulletins 36 to 40 record their most strenu ous efforts along this line Toxicity as a Factor in the Productive Capa city of Soils In Bulletins 36 and 40 are given general reviews of literature relating to this subject and in these and No 28 the main body of experimental data thought to support the theory that soils are rendered unproductive by poisonous excreta thrown off by the roots of higher plants However plausible and attract ive such a theory may appear a eview of the data and discussions presented will convince the unbiased student that little has yet been done which may properly be considered other than speculative contributions to the subject As pointed out the main contentions of the Bureau of Soils supposed to make the con sideration of the toxicity factor pertinent are not supported by its own work or that of others and are not true It has made no discovery therefore demanding such a factor but while this fact should be clearly recog nized it may be well to retain the old theory in the list of alternative working hypotheses although it must be conceded to offer less of promise than many others or than it did when originally proposed for our present knowledge makes it quite uncalled for in ex plaining observed relations But were it true that toxic excreta do play an iimportant role in rendering soils unpro ductive it must be admitted that nothing yet has been published either by the Bureau of Soils or others to which reference is made by the bureau which should in any sense be re garded as proof Indeed much of the bu reaus data can hardly rank as even sug gestive evidence regarding the existence of such conditions in the field because nearly all of the work has been done with seedlings placed under extremely cramped abnormal and unsanitary conditions the plants fed chiefly by the small amount of nutrients stored in the seed and the experiments termi nated after a few days or at most after two or three weeks In illustration take the ex632 SCIENCE N S VOL XXVII No 694 periments with agar agar where wheat seed lings are grown inside of glass tubes with inside diameters less than that of an ordinary lead pencil 6 to 8 mm and 33 cm long three such tubes placed end to end supported on a glass rod with their ends separated 2 to 3 mm thus forming a segmented tube to be filled with transparent agar agar solid when cold and standing in similar agar contained in a glass vessel the whole system arranged to be revolved on a klinostat to neutralize the directive effect of gravity When previously germinated wheat plants are transplanted into the agar inside one of these tubes before it has solidified3 and compelled to grow with its roots thus circumscribed it is held that if toxic excreta are developed they will become so potent as to compel the roots when they reach a gap between two segments to turn from their course along the axis of the tube and grow outward into the fresh uncontami nated agar of the outer vessel It is assumed that if more roots turn outward the presence of a toxic substance is demonstrated and further that the toxic substance was excreted by the roots and is a normal and necessary function under field conditions Plants were grown in free agar in large numbers until the roots by assumption had charged it with toxic substances such agar was then remelted and filtered and used to fill other tubes or to surround tubes containing fresh agar the contention being that if the outside agar is more toxic than that inside the tube a smaller number of roots would grow outward into the poisoned agar Just why any should grow outward into the poisoned agar is not made clear probably it is because those particular roots had rendered the immediate contact agar more toxic than that outside But seriously the experiments would seem to be quite as con clusive a proof that the roots growing inside the tube or growing in the free agar have reduced the water content of thb agar or its soluble salt content and that the roots simply turned one or the other way according as available water or soluble salts are more abundant Our own observations have shown that plant slips placed in water containing sugar dextrine agar agar in the condition de scribed by the Bureau of Soils and even in water holding suspended clay wilt sooner or become less turgid than check slips placed in pure water thus indicating that water is less readily obtained under those conditions It is certainly to be expected that when as many wheat roots grow under such cramped con ditions as are here under consideration as are reported in the bureaus experiments there must be developed a stress for water and it seems just as rational and quite as certain that the deflection of the roots may have been due to this condition The growing of large num bers of plants in free agar agar would cer tainly reduce the per cent of water and the melting of it over would reduce it still further As it is not said that strict quantitative meas ures were taken to secure absolute equality of water and salt content between the inside and outside agar the results are subject to the same interpretation as that suggested These ingenious experiments therefore can not be seriously held to demonstrate that roots ex crete toxic substances neither can it be held that even if toxic substances were developed as either normal or abnormal conditions the deflection of the roots was due to them and there is nothing in the whole range of experi mental work covered by the three bulletins in question which can be held to establish or even necessarily suggest a probability of toxic substances in soils which seriously affect their productivity The loose reasoning here referred to and characterizing the whole of Bulletin 40 and indeed of the other two as well appear to the writer so out of accord with the planning and execution of these particular experiments with agar agar when coupled with our personal acquaintance with the one whose name appears as senior author that we are unable to feel that either the language used or the conclu sions drawn are his This I do know It was my great surprise and misfortune after hav ing submitted manuscript for publication to find my own name on the printers proof as joint author of Bulletin 22 maintaining views directly opposed to those we had submitted and which had been laid aside not to be pubAPRIL 17 1908 SCIENCE 633 lished until after the bureau had expressed its views This much in justice appears necessary to avoid placing criticism where it may not belong It can never be the privilege of the head of a government bureau to sub scribe the names of subordinates to views he knows they do not hold Indeed the interests of science if not a sense of justice should impel any chief to encourage in his subordi nates the greatest freedom of expression of views on scientific problems of investigation and to avoid in every way indicating the sup posed trend of lines of experimentation from which data are sought The true character of some of the more recent evidence being presented in defense of Bulletin 2 along the line of toxicity studies can be better understood from the closing sen tence in Camerons preface to Bulletin 28 when the facts in the case are known Cam eron says The authors of the present paper have had a leading part in the development of the work which the bureau has been conducting along these newer lines of soil investigation and it is believed that the description of the investigations which have made possible the production of a luxuriant lawn upon a naturally unproductive soil at Takoma Park Maryland as well as helped in a very large measure in the development of our present views concerning soil fertility will mark a decided step forward in soil studies and prove suggestive to other investigators in this most important branch of applied science The facts regarding the investigations which have made possible the production of a luxuriant lawn upon a naturally unipro ductive soil  in Professor Whitneys front yard in Takoma Park as pointed out by Cameron are these In August 1904 the area to be treated was dressed with stable manure at the rate of about forty tons per acre and the soil which at the time was filled with a dense network of tree roots many of them large making it difficult to dig was spaded and then seeded to lawn grass which came up and during the fall looked well Cameron thought he saw the utter rout of the bureaus toxicity demon from this lawn and the transformation of a naturally un productive soil  into one of rare fertility But the severe root pruning and the loosening of the soil incident to spading in the manure combined with the fall rains and cool weather which gave the grass seed exceptional facili ties for growth at the same time provided excellent opportunity for the development of new and active tree roots as was later dis covered by the bureau and early in the spring of 1905 as reported in Bulletin 40 the ground became  almost completely filled with young active growing tree roots The plain and simple fact is these roots so thoroughly sapped the soil of its available moisture ren dering it so hard and dry that early in May the grass had died Nevertheless the preface was allowed to stand The new roots in the lawn soil were dis covered and the thought at once arose that these mnight exercise some malignant effect upon the growth of grass Five full table spoons of soil each were effectually paraffined into the standard wire baskets in these were carefully transplanted young trees of pine maple tulip dogwood and cherry two baskets being reserved without trees as checks This done equal numbers of germinated wheat seedlings were set out about the trees in the baskets and allowed to grow two to three weeks replanting as the stress became too severe until at the end of the season 81 trials had been made under such rigid labora tory controland with the remarkable result that in all but 10 of the 81 trials the green weight of the wheat trials was less where the wheat grew under the trees Moreover the bureau wisely observes this reduced yield oc curred in spite of the fact that the roots of the several wheat crops were left in the soil which must have acted as green manure and thus tended to counteract the deleterious effect of the tree roots on the wheat p 19 Bull 40 Then again and with characteristic logic the better growth of wheat under the trees in the last three crops is ascribed to the trees pass ing into the condition of winter rest It is thus the pages run on and one bulletin follows another all having the same indeci sive and misleading character all clearly bearing the stamp of two minds although dif634 SCIENCE N S VOL XXVII No 694 ferent authors may be assigned on title pages If the bureau really has faith in its utter ances why will it not rise to the stature of serious work and get out upon some field with appliances which will enable it to extract from one or more of its highly unproductive soils the toxic substances about which it has written so much and yet in reality accomplished almost nothing This the farmers of the country have a right to demand or else that it shall turn at once its energies into chan nels which have more of promise SINCE writing the above there has been issued from the bureau November 6 another bulletin No 47 along the same line under the title  Certain Organic Constituents of Soils in Relation to Soil Fertility  which not to be misleading and to be true to the sub jectmatter presented as well as to the facts as known with which the bulletin deals should read Certain Organic Constituents in Plants in a Possible Relation to Soil Fertility for although it is stated p 9 that  The toxic properties of soils have been demonstrated and the existence of toxic bodies is a reality with which it is necessary to deal in future soil studies on the fertility and infertility of our agricultural lands and further along it says p 12 It has been demonstrated by the studies described in this bulletin that sub stances commonly used as fertilizers in agri cultural practise have in addition to their function as plant nutrients a welldefined power to overcome and actually destroy toxic bodies yet the facts are nothing which the bureau has yet published can be considered strictly as demonstrating either of these propositions even under the strained and highly abnormal conditions of the experiment cited not to say what does occur under nor mal field conditions In these experiments as heretofore ten wheat seedlings are grown but six to thirteen days in solutions contained in 250cc salt bottles depending for nourishment upon ma terials stored in the seed while the chief cri teria for differences in growth have been the very misleading and indecisive quantities of transpiration or of green weights whereas in such experiments as these it is perfectly feas ible to determine precisely the increase in dry weight both in tops and roots and thus ob tain quantities which can not be misleading as those used are known to be and so acknowl edged at page 15 of the bulletin Moreover in each of the experiments cited with tyrosine choline piperidine quinone vanillin cumarin cinnamic acid esculin and heliotropine it is quite as rational to assume as another among several alternative hypotheses that the real effect of these substances instead of being in any sense toxic to the wheat plants has been to simply diminish the rate at which the stored nourishment in the seed was rendered soluble and available to the growing seedlings Indeed the coating of the roots in several of the cases as cited in the bulletin suggests that the substance of the kernels may have been markedly affected in such a way as to have retarded its transformation into avail able plant food and the failure of the roots to develop into the solution may quite as well have been due to a lack of dissemination of plant food so that there was little to stimulate root development in those cases for it is a fact well established by observation in the field that the roots of crops develop most strongly into portions of the soil where nutri ments are most abundant and available It would clearly be a waste of energy and of food materials for a plant to develop its roots into a nonnutritive solution and these experiments were never continued long enough to have de veloped a stress for water It is worthy of note in this connection that often there was associated with the substances used a relatively less root development than of top if we may judge by the appearances of the illustrations supplemented by definite statements to this effect in the text It is greatly to be regretted that where so much pains has been taken to accumulate data and where the dry weights of the roots and of the tops could with ease and exactness have been determined it was not done as the extra time expense and labor are not worth considering in view of the increased value of the data which would have resulted We speak advisedly on this point because we have done a large amount of work along theAPRIL 17 1908 SCIENCE 635 lines of transpiration and green weights in plants in relation to the dry matter produced the observations covering the full life of the crop coming to complete and normal fruitage In the case where wheat seedlings were grown a second time in the same supposedly toxic solutions a better growth would be ex pected if these substances had the effect of simply rendering the nutrients of the kernels less readily transformed into available food and it is quite possible that crushed wheat kernels placed in these solutions thus elimi nating the vital activities of seedlings might have affected them as favorably as did the growth of the first crop and might have caused a disappearance or a reduction in the amount of the toxic substance These experiments therefore can not be considered fully demon strative Por the same reason and because transpiration is not a measure of growth the experiments with nitrates and with lime are also inconclusive But granting that the data of Bulletin 47 do demonstrate that the substances experimented with are truly toxic to wheat seedlings under the highly cramped and abnormal conditions of the experiment it will be conceded quite rash to affirm that these substances in like quantities would be found similarly toxic in the soil under field conditions until it were known not only that such substances do exist in the field soils but also that they are more abundant in those which are unproductive The unwarranted publication of such posi tive conclusions as those quoted becomes still more evident when an effort is made to give quantitative expression to the recorded data of Bulletin 47 in terms of field conditions cor related with other contentions of the Bureau of Soils It is maintained by the bureau but without sufficient evidence that the capillary movement of soil moisture under crop condi tions is of negligible magnitude and that for this reason the roots of crops in order to secure moisture and plant food and also in order to place the active absorhing root tips into fresh soil not poisoned by their own exereta are compelled to constantly advance into previously unoccupied soil and they are known to spread throughout a depth exceeding three to four feet in the case of most crops The toxic substances of unproductive soils must therefore be deeply distributed through out the root zone and to a depth of at least four feet But the strongest solution used in the experiments of Bulletin 47 of 1000 parts per million means not less than 2800 pounds per acre of field where the water con tent of the soil is 20 per cent and it would mean 700 pounds per acre for the surface foot alone In the case of 100 parts per million the amounts would be 70 pounds and 280 pounds per acre for depths of one and four feet respectively In the light of failures up to the present time to isolate these toxic sub stances from soils it will hardly be seriously contended that any such large amounts of toxic substances do exist in unproductive soils But the smaller amounts experimented with as recorded in Bulletin 47 either had little or no effect or they produced positive increases in growth If therefore the data of the bureau along this line of toxic sub stances are to be given serious consideration at all Bulletin 47 must be regarded as suggesting that on account of the probably small amounts of these toxic substances present in soils and on account of their observed small or else stimulative effect when present in such quan tities toxic substances are either negligible factors in soil fertility or else they are bene ficial to crops F II KNG MADISON WIS

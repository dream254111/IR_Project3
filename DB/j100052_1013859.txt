AND GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION BY FRANK JULIAN WARNE PHD1 WASHINGTON D C A UTHENTIC REPORTS FROM EUROPE THAT EMIGRANTS BY THE HUN DREDS OF THOUSANDS ARE CROWDING ALL THE EMBARKATION PORTS AND ARE OVER FLOWING ALL SHIPPING FACILITIES IN THEIR MAD RUSH TO THE UNITED STATES COUPLED WITH THE STEADY INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF FOREIGNBORN ARRIVALS ON OUR SHORES SINCE THE CLOSE OF THE EUROPEAN WAR2 ARE EVIDENCE THAT THE TIDE OF IMMIGRA TION IS SETTING IN ONCE MORE TO THE SHORES OF THE UNITED STATES AND THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE AGAIN CON FRONTED WITH THIS GREAT NATIONAL PROB LEM BUT FEW REALIZE THE MAGNITUDE THIS IMMIGRANT INVASION HAS ASSUMED AND STILL FEWER APPRECIATE ITS FARREACH ING EFFECTS UPON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND NATION RACIALLY SOCIALLY INDUS TRIALLY AND INSTITUTIONALLY A BRIEF STATISTICAL SURVEY OF THIS TIDE AS IT HAS WASHED UPON OUR SHORES THE PAST ONE HUNDRED YEARS WILL ASSIST IN A COMPRE HENSION OF THE TREMENDOUS INCREASE IN ITS VOLUME PRIOR TO ITS TEMPORARY INTER RUPTION BY THE EUROPEAN WAR A PICTORIAL BIRDS EYE VIEW OF THIS IN FLOW OF FOREIGN BORN IS GIVEN IN THE 1 AUTHOR OF THE SLAV INVASION AND THE MINE WORKERS 1904 THE COAL MINE WORKERS 1905 IMMIGRATION

430000 ALIENS ARRIVED IN THE UNITED STATES DURING THE SIX MONTHS FROM JANUARY TO JULY 1920 ACCOMPANYING CHART REPRODUCED FROM WARNES BOOK OF CHARTS AND WHICH IS BASED UPON STATISTICS FROM THE BUREAU OF IMMIGRATION OF THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR IN THE PAST ONE HUNDRED YEARS THIS IMMIGRATION HAS COMPRISED MORE THAN 33200000 HUMAN BEINGS FROM AN INFLOW OF LESS THAN 129000 FOR THE TEN YEARS FOLLOWING 1820 IT INCREASED TO MORE THAN 8200000 FOR THE DECADE ENDING WITH 1909 THE WAR PERIOD GREATLY REDUCED THIS VOLUME BUT EVEN INCLUDING THOSE FOUR YEARS IMMIGRATION FOR THE DECADE CLOSING WITH 1919 GAVE AN INFLOW OF MORE THAN 6347000 HERE IS AN INCREASE IN THE ONE HUNDRED YEARS FROM A DECENNIAL YEARLY AVERAGE OF 12900 TO NEARLY 635000 THE LARGEST TENYEAR IMMI GRATION WAS FROM 1905 TO 1914 ITS VOLUME EXCEEDING 10100000 OF THE TOTAL OF MORE THAN 33200000 IMMI GRANTS AS MANY AS 26200000 OR 79 PER CENT CAME DURING THE PAST FIFTY YEARS AND AS GREAT A PROPORTION AS 30 PER CENT OF THE TOTAL OR 10122000 DURING THE TEN YEARS IPRIOR TO THE BE GINNING OF THE EUROPEAN WAR THE TEMPORARY EFFECTS OF THE WAR UPON THE VOLUME OF IMMIGRATION ARE INDICATED IN THE FACT THAT WHILE IT REACHED NEARLY 5175000 OR A YEARLY AVERAGE OF MORE THAN 1000000 FOR THE FIVE YEARS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING IT DECREASED TO 1173000 OR AN AVERAGE INFLOW OF ONLY 235000 FOR THE FIVE YEARS FOLLOWING 1914 THIS IS NEARLY 36000 LESS THAN THAT FOR THE SINGLE YEAR IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE BE GINNING OF HOSTILITIES THE LOWEST 181THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY NUMBER OF ARRIVALS IN ANY ONE OF THESE FIVE YEARS WAS 110618 IN 1918 THE SMALLEST YEARLY IMMIGRATION SINCE 1862 JUST PRECEDING THE BEGINNING OF THE CIVIL WAR OUR TOTAL IMMIGRATION OF MORE THAN 33200000 AND THE YEARLY AVERAGE BY DECADES DURING THE PAST ONE HUNDRED YEARS ARE SUMMARIZED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE THESE FIGURES ARE FOR IMMIGRANT ALIENS ONLY AND DO NOT INCLUDE NON IMMIGRANT ARRIVALS THAT IS THOSE RE CORDED AS COMING HERE FOR TEMPORARY PURPOSES ONLY AND NOT FOR PERMANENT RESIDENCE IF THE LATTER WERE INCLUDED THE TOTALS WOULD OF COURSE BE MUCH LARGER ESPECIALLY FOR THE MORE RECENT YEARS BEFORE THE WAR DECENNIAL IMMIGRATION THE PAST

DIED AND STILL OTHERS HAVE EMIGRATED OUR PRESENT FOREIGN BORN POPULATION IS NOT YET KNOWN THE BUREAU OF THE CENSUS NOT HAVING COM PLETED ITS TABULATION OF THE LAST ENU MERATION BUT IN 1910 THERE WAS A TOTAL FOREIGNBORN POPULATION IN THE UNITED STATES OF APPROXIMATELY 13500000 OUT OF A TOTAL IMMIGRATION DOWN TO THAT TIME OF ABOUT 26853000 WHILE THE FIGURES IN THE PRECEDING TABLE IMPRESS ONE WITH THE MAGNITUDE OF THE VOLUME OF IMMIGRATION AT THE SAME TIME THEY SMOOTH OUT THE DIFFER ENCES IN THE INFLOW FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND AT DIFFERENT PERIODS OF TIME BY STUDYING THE YEARLY FIGURES IN THE TABLE OF THE ACCOMPANYING CHART AND RELAT ING THEM TO EVENTS OF INDUSTRIAL OR ECONOMIC HISTORY WE ARE ABLE TO UNDER STAND WHAT IS PROBABLY THE MOST SIG NIFICANT OF ALL THE OPERATING FORCES OR INFLUENCES AT WORK BEHIND THIS GREAT MOVEMENT OF POPULATION ACROSS THE ATLANTIC FOR ILLUSTRATION THE NUMBER OF IM MIGRANT ARRIVALS STRIKINGLY DECREASED FROM NEARLY 428000 IN 1854 TO 200877 THE FOLLOWING YEAR A DECREASE OF MORE THAN ONEHALF THIS FALLING OFF REFLECTED THE EFFECTS OF THE GREATEST FINANCIAL PANIC EVER EXPERIENCED IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES UP TO THAT TIME THE ENSUING INDUSTRIAL DEPRESSION WAS FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY THE CIVIL WAR AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL 1873 THAT THE YEARLY INFLOW AGAIN REACHED AS LARGE A VOLUME THE NUMBER BEING NEARLY 460000 THE YEAR 1873 MARKS ANOTHER PANIC AND A STRIKING DECREASE THE FOLLOWING YEARS IN THE NUMBER OF ALIEN ARRIVALS IS AGAIN RECORDED BEGINNING IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES AND ACCOMPANYING INCREASING PROSPERITY IN ALL OF OUR INDUSTRIES THE VOLUME OF IMMIGRATION STEADILY IN CREASED UNTIL THIS TENDENCY WAS INTER RUPTED BY THE PANIC OF 1893 THE FINANCIAL DISTURBANCE IN THIS COUNTRY IN 1907 WAS SIMILARLY FOLLOWED BY A STRIKING DECREASE IN IMMIGRATION THIS CLOSE RELATION BETWEEN INDUS TRIAL DEPRESSION AND DECREASE IN IMMI GRATION ON THE ONE HAND AND INDUSTRIAL PROSPERITY AND INCREASE IN IMMIGRA TION ON THE OTHER IS THE ECONOMIC EXPLANATION OF THE PERIODIC WAVES OF IMMIGRATION THAT HAVE WASHED OUR SHORES SINCE 1820 AND PARTICULARLY SO IN MORE RECENT YEARS IT POINTS UN MISTAKABLY TO THE ECONOMIC CHARACTER ISTICS OF THIS GREAT MOVEMENT OF POPU LATION AND TO THE FACT THAT BY FAR THE GREATER PART OF IT IS DUE TO THE INDUS 182THE TIDE OF IMMIGRATF DURING THE PAST 100 YEARS IMMIGRATION INTO THE UNITED STATES 1820  P   1820 1830 I 1840    4 1830

1914 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONERGENERAL OF IMMIGRATION IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THE SUCCESSIVE PERIODICAL INCREASES RECEDING LESS EACH TIME COINCIDENT WITH THE PERIODS OF FINANCIAL DE PRESSION ONLY TO REACH TO A GREATER HEIGHT WITH THE NEXT ASCENDING WAVE  THE THREE PERIODS OF DEPRESSION FOLLOWING 18571873 AND 1893 STAND OUT PROMINENTLY AND THE 1907 FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL DE PRESSION CAUSED THE WAVE LINE TO DROP TO A MARKED DEGREE THIS PERIODICAL RISE AND FALL WELL REPRESENTS THE RELATIVE PROSPERITY OF THE COUNTRY THIS INDUSTRIAL DEMAND FOR LABOR WHICH IS MET MOST LARGELY BY IMMIGRA TION IS FOR THE ROUGH UNSKILLED OR COMMON KIND NEARLY 60 PER CENT OF ALL INCOMING ALIENS BEING MALES WITHOUT TRAINED SKILL AND LACKING EVEN THE RUDI MENTS OF AN EDUCATION THIS RAISES A HUNDRED AND ONE QUES TIONS THAT IN RECENT YEARS HAVE COME TO VEX THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN THEY CONTINUE TO BUILD A SAFE DEMOCRACY NOT OUT OF SUCH MATERIAL BUT OUT OF TOO GREAT A SUPPLY OF SUCH MATERIAL ASSIMILATION OF THE IMMIGRANT INTO AMERICAN LIFE IN ALL ITS ASPECTSAND NO OTHER CONSUMMATION OF THE PRESENCE AMONG US OF THE FOREIGN BORN SHOULD BE ENTERTAINEDRESTS PRIMARILY UPON THE OPPORTUNITY FOR CONTINUOUS EM PLOYMENT IN A GAINFUL OCCUPATION AT A WAGE SUFFICIENT AT LEAST TO SUPPLY HIM AND THOSE DEPENDENT UPON HIM WITH THE NECESSITIES FOR PHYSICAL EXISTENCE A NEEDY ALIEN IN THE UNITED STATES OUT OF WORK IS NOT ONLY RETARDED IN ASSIM ILATION BUT HE ALSO HINDERS OR OBSTRUCTS THE OPERATION OF THE FORCES OF ASSIM ILATION THEMSELVES WITH CONTINUOUS EMPLOYMENT AT A LIVING WAGE THE TYPI CAL IMMIGRANT BECOMES AN ASSET TO ALL CONCERNED AND NOT A LIABILITY EITHER TO HIMSELF OR TO OTHER WORKERS OR TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ONLY THAT NUMBER OF IMMIGRANTS THEN SHOULD BE PER MITTED TO ENTER AT ANY ONE TIME FOR WHICH THERE IS OPPORTUNITY FOR SUCH EMPLOYMENT WITHOUT DEPRIVING THOSE ALREADY HERE FOREIGN BORN AS WELL AS NATIVE OF SIMILAR OPPORTUNITY THE FACTS AS TO THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH A CONDI TION CAN BE FAIRLY ACCURATELY ASCER TAINED AS I HAVE ALREADY SUGGESTED BEFORE THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE AND THE NATIONAL CIVIC FEDERATION BY THE ORGANIZATION OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENTAL MACHINERY FOR MEASURING THE ANTICI PATED DEMAND OF OUR INDUSTRIES FOR UNSKILLED WORKERS AT THE PREVAILING AMERICAN RATE OF WAGES THIS IS THE THEORY OF IMMIGRATION CONTROL UPON WHICH IS BASED THE PRINCI PLE OF GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION THAT WILL RESTRICT IT WITHIN THE LIMITS OF AN ASSIMILATIVE SUPPLY ITS FOUNDATION RESTS UPON THAT VIEW OF AMERICAN LIFE WHICH BELIEVES THAT THE ALIEN MUST BE COME AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE MOMENT AN INDISTINGUISHABLE PART OF AMERICAN SOCIETY IT IS NOT SUPERFICIAL SENTIMEN TALITY NEITHER IS IT MISGUIDED OR HUM BUG PHILANTHROPY IT IS NOT BASED ON ECONOMIC EXPLOITATION OF THE ALIEN BY EMPHASIZING HIS CONTRIBUTION TO PRO DUCTION IT IS FUNDAMENTALLY HUMANI TARIAN IN THAT IT SEEKS THE ULTIMATE WELFARE OF BOTH THE IMMIGRANT AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THIS VIEW IT IS NOW NECESSARY TO EMPHASIZE BECAUSE THE EFFECTS FLOWING OUT OF THE EUROPEAN WAR HAVE BROUGHT TO PUBLIC ATTENTION WITH STARTLING SUD DENNESS LIKE THE RAPID SHIFTING OF SCENES ON A MOVINGPICTURE SCREEN ASPECTS OF IMMIGRATION WHICH HERETO FORE HAVE BEEN REGARDED WITH UNRUFFLED COMPLACENCY WE HAVE BEEN MADE CONSCIOUS OF THE EXISTENCE AMONG US IN SPIRIT AS WELL AS IN NAME OF THE HYPHEN ATED AMERICANOF THE GERMANAM ERICAN THE ITALIANAMERICAN AND SO ON WE HAVE FOUND THAT OUR MUCH 183THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY BOASTED FORCES FOR ASSIMILATING THE FOREIGNBORN ELEMENT HAVE NOT BEEN WORKING AS EFFICACIOUSLY AS OUR OPTIMIS TIC IGNORANCE OF THE FACTS HAD LED US TO BELIEVE WE HAVE LEARNED THROUGH SAD EXPERIENCE THAT THESE FORCES NEED INTELLIGENT ATTENTION AND DIRECTION WE HAVE BEEN TAUGHT THAT THEY MUST BE GIVEN GREATER VIGOR IF WE ARE TO BECOME A HOMOGENEOUS PEOPLE AND THUS ESCAPE THE DANGER OF AN INTERNAL DIVISION AMONG OURSELVES OF EVEN GREATER IM PORTANCE POSSIBLY IS THE FACT THAT THERE ARE MILLIONS OF ALIEN SUBJECTS AMONG US WHO HAVE NOT BECOME AND WHO DO NOT INTEND TO BECOME AMNERICAN CITIZENS IN CONSEQUENCE OF ALL THIS AS A NATION AND AS A PEOPLE WE MUST NOW CON SCIOUSLY AND INTELLIGENTLY FACE A WHOLLY NEW GROUP OF PROBLEMS ARISING OUT OF IMMIGRATION THESE PROBLEMS ARE IN EXTRICABLY INTERWOVEN INTO OUR NATIONAL DESTINY THEY ARE A PART OF THE WORK ING OUT OF OUR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS THEIR SOLUTION DEPENDS UPON OUR POW ERS OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ASSIMILATION FOR MANY YEARS TO COME THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SHOULD SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM OF IMMIGRATION FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF ITS RELATION TO OR ITS EFFECT UPON THIS ASSIMILATIVE ABILITY OUR EYES SHOULD HENCEFORTH BE FOCUSED UPON THIS ONE SOLUTION ALL OTHER ASPECTS OF IMMIGRA TION SHOULD BE MADE SUBORDINATE TO IT IT SHOULD CONSCIOUSLY BECOME OF THE VERY GREATEST IMPORTANCE TO US AS A PEOPLE THAT THE IMMIGRANTS WHOM WE WELCOME INTO OUR SOCIETY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE BLESSINGS AND DUTIES OF OUR INSTI TUTIONS SHOULD BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THAT SOCIETY AND NOT FOREIGN TO IT THIS VIEW SAFEGUARDS THE PERMANENT WELFARE OF THE ALIEN WHO COMES HERE TO BECOME A HOMOGENEOUS PART OF US AS WELL AS THE WELFARE OF THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES THEMSELVES THERE IS ABUNDANT EVIDENCE THAT THIS VIEW IS COMING TO BE THAT OF THE AMERI CAN PEOPLE IT IS REFLECTED IN THE PASS AGE BY CONGRESS OF THE LITERACY TEST OVER THE PRESIDENTIAL VETO AND IN THE PRESENT ACTIVITIES OF INNUMERABLE SOCIE TIES AND ORGANIZATIONS WHICH ARE BEING DIRECTED TOWARDS THE AMERICANIZATION OF THE ALIEN MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIA TIONS LABOR UNIONS RELIGIOUS BODIES SOCIETIES OF FOREIGN BORN BOARDS OF EDUCATION STATE AND CITY AMERICAN IZATION DEPARTMENTS OR BOARDS THE WAR AND INTERIOR DEPARTMENTS OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT WOMENS CLUBS COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES LIBRARIES COMMUNITY CENTERS AND SERVICE ORGAN IZATIONS CIVIC COMMITTEES THE BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA THE YOUNG MENS AND YOUNG WOMENS CHRISTIAN ASSO CIATIONS KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS AMERI CAN RED CROSS AND A HOST OF SIMILAR ORGANIZATIONS ARE NOW ENGAGED IN THIS LAUDABLE AND VERY NECESSARY WORK IF AMERICA IS TO MEAN TO THE IMMIGRANT AND THE IMMIGRANT IS TO MEAN TO AMERICA ALL THAT IS NECESSARY AND VITAL TO A HOMOGENEOUS PEOPLE RECENTLY A FOUR DAYS SESSION OF AN AMERICANIZA TION CONFERENCE WAS HELD IN WASHING TON UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR WHILE THERE MAY BE DIFFERENCES AS TO THE MEANING OF AMERICANIZATION AND DISPUTES AS TO THE BEST MEANS TO BE EMPLOYED TO ATTAIN IT THE PRINCIPLE OF ASSIMILATION SHOULD BE THE FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF MEASUREMENT TO BE APPLIED TO IMMIGRATION GENERALLY AS WELL AS TO ANY PARTICULAR RACIAL GROUP WITHIN THE IMMIGRATION STREAM IT SHOULD BE THE BASIS OF ANY ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION ON IMMIGRATION BY CONGRESS OUR MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED YEARS EXPERIENCE OF THE EFFECTS OF IMMIGRATION HAS TAUGHT US THE RACIAL GROUPS THAT DO NOT ASSIM ILATE AMERICAN CUSTOMS AND DO NOT BECOME A HOMOGENEOUS PART OF OUR POPULATION THEN AGAIN WE KNOW WITHOUT QUESTION THAT IF THOSE WHO DO ASSIMILATE MORE OR LESS READILY UNDER FAVORABLE CONDITIONS ARE PERMITTED TO 184THE INDUSTRIAL SIGNIFICANCE OF IMMIGRATION ENTER IN TOO GREAT A VOLUME THEY ARE CERTAIN TO DISARRANGE THE ASSIMILATING PROCESS IF THE VOLUME OF TOTAL IMMI GRATION IS LIKELY AT ANY TIME TO BECOME SO LARGE AS TO MAKE INEFFECTIVE OUR FORCES OF ASSIMILATION THEN THIS VOLUME SHOULD BE DECREASED BY RESTRICTIVE MEASURES IF THE ELEMENTS COMPRISING ANY PARTICULAR GROUP OR RACE NO MATTER HOW FEW IN NUMBER RELATIVELY ARE UN ASSIMILABLE INTO OUR AMERICAN LIFE THEN THESE TOO SHOULD BE RESTRICTED THE INDUSTRIAL SIGNIFICANCE OF IMMIGRATION BY W JETT LAUCK1 FORMER SECRETARY NATIONAL WAR LABOR BOARD WASHINGTON D C URING PRESIDENT ROOSEVELTS AD MINISTRATION THE CONGRESS ES TABLISHED AN IMMIGRATION COMMISSION AND PROVIDED IT LIBERALLY WITH FUNDS SO THAT IT MIGHT MAKE A SATISFACTORY IN QUIRY INTO ALL PHASES OF THE IMMIGRA TION PROBLEM IT WAS COMPOSED OF THREE MEMBERS SELECTED FROM EACH BRANCH OF THE CONGRESS AND THREE REP RESENTATIVES OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC NAMED BY THE PRESIDENT THIS BODY BEGAN ITS WORK IN 1907 AND SUBMITTED ITS VOLUMINOUS REPORT THREE YEARS LATER THE ORIGINAL INVESTIGATION WHICH WAS CONDUCTED AS TO THE ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF IMMIGRATION INCLUDED WITHIN ITS SCOPE ALL THE BASIC INDUSTRIES OF THE COUNTRY ALL PHASES OF THE INDUSTRIAL SIGNIFICANCE OF IMMIGRATION WERE EX HAUSTIVELY STUDIED AND ANALYZED THE FINAL CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDA TIONS WHICH WERE BASED ON THIS INQUIRY MAY BE SAID TO BE REPRESENTATIVE AND ENTIRELY ACCEPTABLE FOR THE PERIOD IM MEDIATELY PRECEDING THE WAR THEY WERE IN BRIEF AS FOLLOWS 1 WHILE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AS IN THE PAST WELCOME THE OPPRESSED OF OTHER LANDS CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN THAT IMMIGRATION BE SUCH BOTH IN QUALITY AND QUANTITY SO AS NOT TO MAKE TOO DIFFICULT THE PROCESS OF ASSIMILATION 2 SINCE THE EXISTING LAW AND FURTHER SPECIAL LEGISLATION RECOMMENDED IN THIS RE AUTHOR OF THE IMMIGRATION PROBLEMWITH PROF J W JENKS 1911 REPORTS OF U S IMMIGRATION COMMISSION VOLS IVXVIIITHE EDITOR PORT DEAL WITH THE PHYSICALLY AND MORALLY UNFIT FURTHER GENERAL LEGISLATION CONCERN ING THE ADMISSION OF ALIENS SHOULD BE BASED PRIMARILY UPON ECONOMIC OR BUSINESS CON SIDERATIONS TOUCHING THE PROSPERITY AND ECONOMIC WELLBEING OF OUR PEOPLE 3 THE MEASURE OF THE RATIONAL HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT OF A COUNTRY IS NOT THE EXTENT OF ITS INVESTMENT OF CAPITAL ITS OUTPUT OF PRODUCTS OR ITS EXPORTS AND IMPORTS UNLESS THERE IS A CORRESPONDING ECONOMIC OPPOR TUNITY AFFORDED TO THE CITIZEN DEPENDENT UPON EMPLOYMENT FOR HIS MATERIAL MENTAL AND MORAL DEVELOPMENT 4 THE DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS MAY BE BROUGHT ABOUT BY MEANS WHICH LOWER THE STANDARD OF LIVING OF THE WAGEEARNERS A SLOW EXPANSION OF INDUSTRY WHICH WOULD PERMIT THE ADAPTION AND ASSIMILATION OF THE INCOMING LABOR SUPPLY IS PREFERABLE TO A VERY RAPID INDUSTRIAL EXPANSION WHICH RE SULTS IN THE IMMIGRATION OF LABORERS OF LOW STANDARDS AND EFFICIENCY WHO IMPERIL THE AMERICAN STANDARD OF WAGES AND CONDI TIONS OF EMPLOYMENT      8 THE INVESTIGATIONS OF THE COMMISSION SHOW AN OVERSUPPLY OF UNSKILLED LABOR IN BASIC INDUSTRIES TO AN EXTENT WHICH INDI CATES AN OVERSUPPLY OF UNSKILLED LABOR IN THE INDUSTRIES OF THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE A CONDITION WHICH DEMANDS LEGISLATION RE STRICTING THE FURTHER ADMISSION OF SUCH UN SKILLED LABOR IT IS DESIRABLE IN MAKING THE RESTRICTION THAT A A SUFFICIENT NUMBER BE DEBARRED TO PRODUCE A MARKED EFFECT UPON THE PRESENT SUPPLY OF UNSKILLED LABOR I85

the differences between the velocities in Cases I and II and between those in III and IV representing double the velocity due to the difference in density of the water in different parts of the tube are about equal also the differences between Cases I and III and II and IV representing the variation due to imperfect adjustment of the axis are approximately the same In order to show that there was no appreciable effect from convection currents while the ring was in a horizontal position several readings were taken after the tube had remained at rest for some time none of which showed a motion larger than 015 mm per second In order to obtain the best possible results the ring should be mounted as rigidly as pos sible in a room of equal temperature through out and the axis should be capable of accu rate adjustment parallel to the ring If the radius of the ring were made smaller although the effect of the earths rotation would be less it would be easier to keep all parts of the tube at an equal temperature and the ring could be turned more quickly Moreover since the motion would not be so great the velocity of the water would diminish less rapidly so that more accurate readings could be obtained With a more mobile liquid the motion would of course continue longer Even with the comparatively crude apparatus described above however it is not difficult to show that the earth revolves

expressed similar views while Moodie correcting Baurs observations on the lateral line grooves in the skull has seemingly demonstrated the general homology of the skull top of Polypterus with that of Stego cephalia Gegenbaur supported the homology of the Stegocephalian cleithrum with the  clavicle of Polypterus and other fishes while Klaatsch6 showed that the pectoral limbs of Polypterus both in musculature and osteology in many respects remotely suggest Amphibian conditions On the other hand Goodrichs studies on the scales of fishes to gether with the evidence offered especially by the brain of Polypterus tend to remove that genus widely from genetic relationship with the Amphibia The Paleozoic Crossopterygii have hitherto yielded a few though significant hints of Amphibian relationship The Texas Permian Crossopterygian fish named by Cope Ecto steorhachis nitidus and recently figured by Hussakof as Megalichthys nitidus suggests remote Stegocephalian affinities in the skull and the

has recently been ad duced by D M S Watson8 of Manchester in describing some of the large Stegocephalia of the Coal Measures preserved in the Newcastle Museum He finds that the skulls of the Carboniferous Labyrinthdonts Lox omma and Pteroplax reveal striking re semblances to the Carboniferous Crossoptery gian Megalichthys The Basisphenoid of Megalichthys has some times carotid foramina just as in Loxomma It has small but distinct basipterygoid processes which are however not provided with articulating surfaces but with sutural ones The long para sphenoid extends forward to the premaxillme as it may do in Pteroplax Its lateral borders are in contact with the Pterygoids to which they afford support and the bone is connected with the roof of the skull by a fused ethmoid The prevomer is identical with that of Lox oemma in the majority of its attachments carries one large tusk and a pit for the replacing tooth It meets its fellow of the opposite side and forms the front of the posterior naris it is doubtful however if it meets the palatopterygoid The Palatopterygoid of Megalichthys is exceed ingly like the palatine and ptQrygoid of Pteroplax They have similar relations to the basisphenoid parasphenoid and maxilla There is the same row of small teeth parallel to those of the maxilla with lot Ueber die Saurodipterinen Dendrodonten Glyptolepiden und Cheirolepiden des

teeth inside them and the pterygoid is cov ered with the same shagreen of fine teeth Examination of these primitive and extremely wellpreserved skulls seems to show that the ordi nary idea of autostylism of the Tetrapoda is incorrect in postulating a connection between the pterygoquadrate cartilage and the otic region It is I think quite certain that there never was such a connection in primitive forms except through the dermal bones of the temporal region The lower attachment with the basisphenoid I have just shown to exist in Crossopterygians which are hence  amphistylic in a different way to Notidanus The large teeth on the palatine with in folded bases exhibit a curious type of tooth replacement which is very characteristic of the Stegocephalia and is unknown elsewhere except in the Crossopterygian fish where it occurs in a very typical form in the vomerine tusks of Megalichthys and no doubt in many other genera and in Lepidosteus This oc currence seems to me a strong additional reason for regarding the Tetrapoda as derived from this group of fish14 The lower jaw of Loxomma likewise ap proaches the Crossopterygian type in the fact that the splenial is entirely a bone of the outer side of the jaw as is the first infraden tary of the Crossopterygian mandible Watsons observations also have important bearing on the relations of the Permian rep tilia These have been distinguished from contemporary Stegocephalians chiefly by the single basioccipital condyle and by the large pterygoids which leave only a small inter pterygoid vacuity divided by a narrow para sphenoid Watson has shown that these and other reptilian characters are fully ex hibited in Loxomma Pteropldx Anthraco saurus and other Carboniferous Stegocepha lians that these characters they share also with Megalichthys and that no palate with large vacuities like that of Eryops or Capitosaurus has ever been found in Carboniferous rocks He therefore concludes that  the reptilia were separated off very early in the history of the Stegocephalia preserving features which were 141bid p 5 807N S VOL XXXVII No 960 rapidly lost by the latter group which had a much accelerated evolution

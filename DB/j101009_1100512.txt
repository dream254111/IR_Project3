Court of Appeals At Richmond November 21 1901 1 CHANCERY PLEADINGDemurrerFailure to pass on A demurrer to a bill of which no disposition has been made will be regarded as overruled  Reported by M P Burks State Reporter19011 MILLER V BLACK ROCK SPRINGS IMPROVEMENT CO 557 2 SUBSURFACE WATERPercolationaOwnershipRight to intercept SuDsurface waters which merely percolate ooze or filter through the soil and which do not flow in any permanent distinct or definite channel belong to the owner of the soil and pas with it just as the rocks and ores beneath the surface pass In the absence of malice or negligence the owner may appropriate them to his own use and if in so doing such waters are diverted from the lands of the adjacent proprietor it is damnum absque injutia 3 SUBSURFACE WATERCase in judgmentInterception of water In the case in judgment the appellant in order to procure water for his own use dug a ditch on his own land near the line of the appellee in consequence of which the water which had formerly flowed through unknown and indistinct channels into appellees spring just across the line was diverted and thereafter perco lated into the ditch and flowed through the lands of appellant Neither malice nor negligence being established it was held that appellant had not exceeded his rights in digging the ditch 4 SUBSURFACE WATER Well defined stream Us by upper proprietor If the supply of a spring on the land of one person is by a well defined stream of water coming through the land of another the latter is entitled to a reason able use of the water on his own land Appeal from a decree of the Circuit Court of Augusta county pro nounced July 3 1901 in a suit in chancery wherein the appellee was the complainant and the appellant was the defendant Reversed The opinion states the ease George G Grattan for the appellant Patrick  Gordon for the appellee CARDWELL J deliverecd the opinion of the court The bill in this case filed by appellee a corporation and the com plainant in the court below alleges that it and the defendant below appellant here are the owners of two adjoining tracts of land lying on the slope of the Blue Ridge Mountains near the dividing line between the counties of Rockingham and Augusta the property of each being used as a summer resort or watering place that soon after appellee was incorporated and purchased its tract of land a question arose between it and appellant as to the ownership of two springs the smaller one a mineral spring situated near the dividing line between the two properties that litigation was the result of this controversy and it was finally decided that the springs were upon the land of appellee and appellant was restrained by injunction in 1893 from using the water from the springs c and that thereafter appellant made several fruitless efforts to secure the use of these waters for his558 7 VIRGlINIA LAW REGISTER Dec boardinghouse and his guests The bill then concludes as follows Finding that he had finally to give up the use of these waters by open means above the surface Miller appellant has recently under taken to tap the springs by a ditch along close to the line between the two properties which digging has been done in the county of Augusta By this means he has crossed the sources of one of the springs and turned it into the ditch he has dug and carried it down to his own property So much so that the spring has almost entirely ceased to flow and your orator is advised that he is going on in his search for the other one This is not only an invasion of your orators property rights in the diversion of water whose natural flow is on the lands of the orators property as it is at present used and an almost absolute destruction of its value for any purpose if this water is allowed to be taken away The injury thus worked to your orator would be irrepa rable c The prayer is for an injunction to restrain appellant his agent c from digging on his own land so as to strike the sources of the springs which rise on appellees land or from in any way re ducing the flow of the water that would naturally flow out at the springs or from in any way interfering with appellees use of said water whether above or below the ground that he appellant may be required peremptorily at once and if he does not do so promptly that complainant may be permitted to go on his premises and fill in the ditch that he has already dug so as to restore said stream if it can possibly be done to its natural flow c Appellant demurred to and answered the bill and in his answer admits the former litigation concerning the spring in question resulting in an injunction restraining him from using the water therefrom and that he did dig upon his own land to obtain water but claims that he was simply doing what he had a perfect right to do that he was not seeking to cut off the sources of any spring on appellees land that he did not know and could not tell where the water which flowed from appellees spring came from but if it be true as appellee infers that it comes from appellants land he will certainly be allowed a reason able use of waters flowing through his land whether above or below the surface c He further claims that he does not know neither can any one say where are the sources of these springs other than the springs themselves and that the digging he did on his own land was not done to vex appellee or done with malice and intent to injure its property but was simply done in the exercise of his lawful rights on his own soil in order to procure water for his own use1901 MILLER V BLACK ROCK SPRINGS IMPROVEMENT CO 559 No disposition seems to have been made of the demurrer to the bill and it is to be regarded as overruled Miller v Miller 93 Va 193 but this does not constitute error as the bill upon its face states a case for equity jurisdiction Upon hearing the cause upon the bill and answer and the deposi tions of witnesses the Circuit Court being of opinion that the nature and extent of the digging complained of in the bill was not plainly shown by the evidence ordered that the complainant appellee take furtlher evidence on this point Whereupon only the deposition of C S Patterson president of the appellee company who had twice before testified in the cause was taken and upon a final hearing the decree appealed from was made perpetuating the temporary injunction A great number of cases have been considered by this court involv ing the correlative rights of adjoining owners of land in reference to running streams on the surface but the question presented in this case has not heretofore been considered In Frazier v Brown 12 Ohio St Rep 294 the facts were almost identical with those appearing in this record and in an able and exhaustive opinion concurred in by the entire court it was held 1 that in the absence of express contract and positive legislation as between proprietors of adjoining lands the law recognizes no correla tive rights in respect to underground waters percolating oozing or filtering through the earth hence where a landowner digs a  hole  on his own land for purposes connected with the use of his own land thereby cutting off or diverting underground waters which have always been accustomed to percolate ooze through his land to the land of an adjoining proprietor and there form the source of a spring or rivu let any damage thereby occasioned to such adjoining proprietor is damnurm abeque injuria 2 the act towit the use of his own prop erty being lawful in itself the motive with which the act was done is a matter of indifference The question was left open in that case whether it would have made any difference in law if the  hole  had been dug from motives of un mixed malice and was designed for no purpose of either ornament or use A large number of cases are to be found and some of them are cited for appellee in which it was held that owner of an adjoining tract of land by digging thereon cannot divert the water from his neighbors spring or well if the digging is done with malice or with the intent to deprive his neighbor of the water but they have no application to this560 7 VIRGINIA LAW YEGISTER Dec case as it is neither alleged nor proved that the acts of the appellant were done either maliciouslv or with intent only to deprive appellee of the flow of water to its spring The opinion in Frazier v Brown supra says  In considering the relative rights and obligations of owners of adjoining lands in respect to water passing from the lands of one to those of the other the sub ject naturally divides itself into four branches of enquiry and this on account of the four different modes in which water may and sometimes does pass from one tract to another 1 In respect to surface streams which flow in a permanent dis tinct and welldefined channel from the lands of one owner to those of another 2 In respect to surface watershowever originatingwhich without any distinct or welldefined channel by attraction gravitation or otherwise are shed and pass from the lands of one proprietor to those of another  3 Subterranean streams which flow in a permanent distinct and welldefined channel from the lands of one to those of another pro prietor  4 Subsurface waters which without any permanent distinct or definite channel percolating in mere veins ooze or filter from the lands of one owner to the lands of another  The whole subject in all of its branches is governed by two general and fundamental maxims which are first that the estate usufruct and dominion of the owner of lands extends from the sky to the lowest depths of the earth second that every man shall so use his own as not to injure his neighbor These maxims however like most general rules are in their application subject to modifications or exceptions growing out of certain great principles of natural right anterior in their origin and superior in their obligation to all individual proprietorship out of certain paramount considerations of public policy and from the established principles that however great or obvious the damage may be the law will regard as an injury that only which contravenes or interferes with a recognized right In the case before us we are only concerned with the fourth branch of inquiry mentioned above towit Subsurface waters which without any permanent distinct or definite channel percolate in mere veins ooze or filter from the lands of another The bill does allege that there are two springs upon appellees land supplied with water coming from appellants land and which are in1901 MILLER V BLACK ROCK SPRINGS IMPROVEMENT CO 561 fact the only value that the property of appellee has so that to be in any way deprived of these springs would be practically to be deprived of the property but as we have already seen it is not alleged that the water the obstruction and detention or diversion of which is com plained of reaches appellees land from the lands of the appellant in any distinct definite or known channel either bove or below the snrface What then is the proof as to the character of the supply of water to the spring alleged to have been destroyed or injured by the acts of appellant  Much testimony was introduced for appellee to show the conduct of appellant in attempting to obtain the use of the water from the springs and as to the digging of the ditch along or near the dividing line be tween the two properties and its effect upon the smaller of the springs which is situated fifteen or sixteen feet from the dividing line but very little testimony as to the character of the supply of water to the spring Instead of showing that the supply of water to the spring is through a distinct definite or known channel the reverse is the effect of the testimony C S Patterson president of the appellee company testifying in its behalf describes the premises and the ditch dug by appellant and both he and other witnesses say that the water in the smaller of the springs was so reduced and lowered by the digging of the ditch and the gath ering of the water in it that the water would not run out of the spring The ditch is described as beginning with the top of the ground and running into the slope of the mountain thirty feet and of a depth of from eight to ten feet where it stops above the spring The witness Patterson was asked if the water came into the ditch at the point where it stopped and his answer was  The water came in along the side and continued on as far as he dug the ditch This is practically all the testimony in the record as to the character of the supply of water to the spring in question The appellant in his answer says that he dug upon his own land to ob tain water that he was simply 01oing what he had a perfect right to do that he was not seeking to cut off the sources of any spring on appel lees land that he did not know and could not tell where the water which flowed from appellees spring came from but if it be true as inferred by appellee that it came from appellants land he would certainly be allowed a reasonable use of it c In his deposition he says that he started the digging upon his own land with the view of562 7 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Dec putting in a pair of steps but after going in a few feet he struck water and concluded to open up a spring That when he discovered there was a prospect for water at that point and began to open it up he bad no intention whatever of cutting the sources of appellees springs as he did not know where the sources of the springs were nor did he intend to injure appellee in any way but only intended to add to the value of his own property and to his own comfort There is testimony for appellee tending to show that appellants statement as to why he began the digging on his land was untrue that there was bad feeling between the parties and that appellant was actuated by malice in digging the ditch but it is we think irrele vant The simple question made by the pleading is Did appellant have a lawful right to do what appellee complains of  Cooley in his work on Torts 2d ed 689 says If one by excavation on his own land draws off the subterraneous waters from the lands of his neighbors to the prejudice of the latter no action will lie for the consequent damages This is fully settled in England by the leading case of Acton v Blundell 12 M  W 324 and in a later case it is decided that prospective rights cannot be gained in subterraneous waters which will preclude such excavations on adjoin ing grounds as may draw them off These decisions have been gener ally followed in this country and it may be considered settled law that if the well dug by one man ruins the well or spring of his neighbor by drawing off its water it is damnum absque injuria Probably if the subterraneous water were a stream flowing in a wellknown course it would be different and one through whose land it flowed would be protected against its being drawn away from him But one claiming rights in such a stream would be under the necessity of proving its existence and tracing it not an easy task in any case In Gould on Waters 3d ed  sec 280 it is said Water per colating through the ground and beneath the surface either without a definite channel or in courses which are unknown and unascertainabale belongs to the realty into which it is found The rule that a man may freely and absolutely use his property so long as he does not directly invade that of his neighbor or consequently injure his clearly defined rights is applicable to the interruption of subsurface supplies of water or of a stream and the damage resulting therefrom is not the subject of legal redress The landowner may therefore nmake a ditch to drain his land or dig a well thereon or open and work a quarry upon it or otherwise change its natural condition although by so1901 MILLER V BLACK ROCK SPRINGS IMPROVEMENT CO 563 doing be interrupts the underground sources of a spring or well on his neighbors land The only remedy for the latter is to sink his own well deeper He may take the water which would otherwise pass by natural percolation into the adjoining land or draw off the water which may come by natural percolation from that land and no ad verse right to prevent the exercise of this privilege can be acquired by prescription Among the many authorities cited in support of the text just quoted is the case of Wheately v Baugh relied on by appellees counsel here and reported in 25 Penn St 528 and 64 Am Dec 721 It fully sustains the principles stated in the text and not the contention of appellee It holds that the destruction of a spring depending for its supply on percolation from the land above by use of the land above for mining or other lawful purposes will not render the owner liable in damages to the owner of the lower land whose spring is destroyed unless the injury was occasioned by malice or negligence In a note to the case 64 Amer Dec supra it is said Water percolating beneath the surface without a definite channel or in courses which are unknown and unascertainable is not subject to the settled law gcverning the rights of riparian owners Waters which thus appear not to be supplied by a definite flowing stream are presumed to be the result of the ordinary percolations of water in the soil such a presumption being necessary to obviate the difficulty of determining whether the water flows in a channel Where percolating water is found it belongs to the realty where it is found The rules of law stated in the note are sanctioned by all the text writers and among the authorities cited in support of them are the leading cases of Chasemore v Richards 7 H L Cas 349 Dickenson v Grand Junc Canal Co 7 Exch 282 and Acton v Blundell supra In Cha8emore v Richards it was said The principles which regulate the rights of owners of land in respect to water flowing in known and different channels whether upon or below the surface of the ground do not apply to underground water which merely percolates through the strata in no known channels Where therefore a land owner and a millowner who had for above sixty years enjoyed the use of a stream which was chiefly supplied by such percolating under ground water lost the use of the stream after an adjoining owner had dug on his own ground an extensive well fbr the purpose of supplying564 7 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Dec the inhabitants of the district many of whom had no title as land owners to the use of the water the millowner had no right of action and the principle applies although the water flows sub terraneously in a channel which was and by excavation could have been ascertained to be definite if the chanrnel is not absolutely known  The only difference in the application of the law to surface and sub surface streams is in ascertaining the character of the stream If it does not appear that the waters which came to the surface are supplied by a definite flowing stream they will be presumed to be formed by the ordinary percolations of water in the soil    A stream or water course consists of bed banks and water and to maintain the right to a water course it must be made to appear that the water necessarily flows in a certain direction and by regular channel with banks or side and having a substantial existence but it ned not be shown that the water flows continually as it may be dry at times Tampa Water Wks v Cline 37 Fla 586 33 L R A 376 Roath v Driscoll 20 Conn 533 In Wheelock v Jacobs 70 Vt 162 43 L R A 1005 it is held that a stream of water large enough to fill a fiveeighths pipe running through a fissure or hole in the bedrock several feet below the surface of the ground but not flowing in a welldefined channel underground is to be deemed percolating water which can be appropriated by the owner of the land without liability to the owner of a spring a short distance therefrom into which some of the water has been accustomed to find its way See also So Pac R R v Dufour 19 L R A 92 and authorities cited in foot note to that case Subterranean waters can only be the subject of riparian riglits when flowing in defined or known channels Defined means a con tracted and bounded channel although the course of the stream may be undefined by human knowledge  Known  means the knowl edge by reasonable inference from existing and observed facts in the natural or preexisting condition of the surface of the ground  Known  in this rule of law is not synonymous with  visible nor is it restricted to knowledge derived from exposure of the channel by excavation Water percolating through the ground in no defined or visible channel is not a stream 14 Mews E C L 1955 It was said by Lord Watson in MeNab v Robertson 1 A C 134 The word  stream in its primary and natural sense denotes a body of water having as such body a continuous flow in one direction    I see no reason to doubt that subterraneous flow of water may1901 MILLER V BLACK ROCK SPRINGS IMPROVEMENT CO 565 in some circumstances possess the very characteristics of water running on the surface but in my opinion water whether falling from the sky or escaping from a spring which does not flow onward with any con tinuity of parts but becomes dissipated in the earths strata and simply percolates through or along those strata until it issues from them at a lower level through dislocation of the strata or otherwise cannot with any propriety be described as a I stream  In Roath v Drisoll supra it is said Water whether moving or motionless in the earth is not in the eye of the law distinct from the earth The laws of its existence and progress while there are not uniform and cannot be known and regulated It rises to great heights and moves collaterally by influences beyond our apprehension These influences are so secret changeable and uncontrollable we can not subject them to the regulations of law nor build upon them a system of rules as has been done with streams upon the surface Priority of enjoyment does not in like cases abridge the natural rights of adjoining proprietors Another case in which the facts are very similar to the case at bar is Trustees v Youman 50 Barb 316 45 N Y 362 In that case the plaintiff owned land in which were two springs which supplied him with water Adjacent to those and situated upon a higher slope was the defendants land One of the plaintiffs springs was close to the line of defendants land the other about two rods distant from it The defendant in order to procure water within his land for his own use dug a trench therein along the lower border of his land and in so doing diminished the quantity of water in plaintiffs springs by cutting off some of the underground sources of supply In opinions by two of the judges affirming the judgment of the lower court dismissing the plaintiffs complaint nearly all the authorities bearing upon the question are reviewed and it was held that the weight of authority clearly sustained the right of the defendant to dig in his own land to obtain water for proper and necessary uses at his house and barn even if by so doing he materially interfered with the natural flow of water from the springs issuing from the lands of the plaintiff adjoining the defendants premises that the question was not whether the plaintiff could maintain an action against the defendant for damages for negligence or want of due care in digging in his land close to the line of plaintiffs land but was whether the defendant should be restrained from digging in his land whatever his object or motives were to the injury of the plaintiffs springs The opinion of566 7 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Dec Balcom J concludes  If the defendant were liable for digging in his land for water for domestic or agricultural purposes near the line of the plaintiffs land out of which these springs issue because such digging materially lessened or prevented the flow of water from such springs then he and all others would be liable for digging for a like proper purpose in their lands though a half mile from plaintiffs springs provided such digging would prevent the water issuing from such springs Such a rule would create more vexation than it would do good and it might become intolerable The weight of authority is opposed to such a rule The decisions in Campbell and Storys Reports supra and the doctrine of Chancellor Walworth in Smith v Adams supra are overborne by the numerous opposing authorities I have cited Many of the authorities referred to above and a number of others are cited by Mr Minor in support of the following text Upon considerations of policy as well of natural right subterranean streams whose springs and sources are not known are not governed by like principles as regulate those which flow over the surface but they are held rather to fall within the doctrine which gives to the owner of the soil all that lies beneath it whether it be solid rock porous earth or veins of water so that he may dig therein and apply that which is found there to his own purpose at his absolute will and pleasure and if in the exercise of such rights he intercepts or draws off water col lected from underground springs in his neighbors well the inconveni ence of his neighbor falls within the description of damnum absque in juria and is no ground for an action 3 Minors Inst 2d ed  18 In 27 Amer  Eng Enc L at page 425 it is said  The cor relative rights of adjoining proprietors in reference to runninlg streams whether on the surface or subterraneous and the general principles relating thereto have no application to undefined subterranean waters which are merely the result of natural and ordinary percolations through the soil such waters are part of the land itself and belong absolutely to the proprietor within his territory and it has been well settled by a long and unbroken line of authority that a proprietor of land may dig a well upon his own premises mine drain it or in any way change its natural condition even though in so doing he may intercept or impede the natural underground percolations the sources of supply of his neighbors spring or water He may as lawfully draw the natural percolations from his neighbors land as prevent the percolations of his own well going into the well of his neighbor1901 MILLER V BLACK ROCK SPRINGS IMPROVEMENT CO 567 Such underground waters are as much the property of the owners of the land as the ores rocks etc beneath the soil The text is sup ported by a great number of authorities cited In the well reasoned opinion of Lewis C J in Wheatley v Baugh upra it is said  When the filtrations are gathered into sufficient volume to have an appreciable value and to flow in a clearly defined channel it is generally possible to see it and to avoid diverting it without serious detriment to the owner of the land through which it flows But percolations spread in every direction through the earth and it is impossible to avoid disturbing them without relinquishing the necessary enjoyment of the land Accordingly the law has never gone so far as to recognize in one man the right to convert anothers farm to his own use for the purposes of filter Such a claim if sus tained would amount to a total abrogation of the right of property No man could dig a cellar or a well or build a house on his own laud because these operations necessarily intercept the filtrations through the earth Nor could he cut down the forest and clear his land for the purposes of husbandry because the evaporation which would be caused by exposing the soil to the sun and air would inevitably dimin ish to some extent the supply of water which would otherwise filter through it He could not overturn a furrow for agricultural purposes because this would partially produce the same result Even if this right were admitted to exist the difficulty in ascertaining the fact of its violation as well as the extent of it would be insurmountable There is respectable authority and several of the cases are cited for appellee seemingly in conflict with those we have referred to above but they are cases in which the facts and circumstances were very different from those in this case They are cases in which the stream in question though subterranean was well defined and came more properly under the rules of law applicable to surface water or in which the acts complained of were done maliciously or with the sole purpose on the part of one landowner to deprive another landowner his neighbor of the supply of water to his spring or well In this case if appellant had dug a well on his own land for the purpose of obtaining a supply of water for his own use the result of which was to dry up the spring on appellees land it would not be contended that appellee would have had a cause of action against appellant for so doing It is also unnecessary to cite authority for the proposition that if the supply of the spring in question is by a welldefined stream of water coming from the lands of aupellant though subsurface568 7 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Dec he would be entitled to a reasonable use of the water on his own land The water did not come into the ditch dug by appellant in a stream of aiiy size or character but according to appellees principal witness The water came in along the side and continued on as far as he dug the ditch In other words the water percolated or filtered into the ditch along its side its whole lengththirty feet Whether if it appeared that the supply of the spring was through a welldefined channel which could have been preserved without detriment to appel lants property through which it flowed as well as the question whether if the interference with the sources of the spring was attributable to malice or negligence are questions not before us We are unable to see from the evidence in the case that appellant has been guilty of any act beyond the lawful use of his own property and are therefore of opinion that the decree appealed from must be reversed and annulled and this court will enter such decree as the Circuit Court ought to have entered dismissing appellees bill Reversed NOTEThis case seems well decided on principleand authority Weconfess to an especial partiality for opinions that indicate on their face that the court has carefully gone through the authoritiesand that contain a review of the cases so that the profession is able to see from the opinions themselves whether the authorities sustain the court or otherwise Such opinions require more time and care in their preparation and take up more space in the reports but they render erro less probable they invite the confidence of the bar and contribute something to the science of the law It is to be observed that the real point decided in this case is that the adjoining owner may reasonably and for a proper purpose interrupt the flow of his neigh bors spring by digging on his own property when the spring is fed by percolation There is much said in the numerous quotations from other opinions as to subter ranean waters flowing in defined streams but the decision is expressly based on the fact that the intercepted water was not flowing in a defined subterranean channel but was percolating water only Much more difficulty is presented when the sub terranean water flows in a defined channel as shown in the annotation to Wheatley v Baugh 64 Am Dec 721 cited in the opinion In a recent New York case an exception was established to the rule announced in the principal case that the interception of percolating water is damnum absque injuria The city of New York had purchased two acres of land into which it sunk numerous wells and on which established pumping stations with suction pumps of great power for the purpose of supplying water to private consumers in the city for a money consideration The effect was to lower the underground water table on the adjoining farms and to render them unfit for the cultivation and growth of the crops for which the soil was especially adapted The court recognized the1901 MILLER V BLACK ROCK SPRINGS IMPROVEMENT CO 569 ordinary right of every proprietor to use the subsurface water in order to enjoy the land as land  either for the purposes of pleasure abode productiveness of soil trade manufacture or for whatever else the land as land may serve But to fit it up with wells and pumps of such pervasive and potential reach that from their base the defendant can tap the water stored in the plantiffs land and in all the region thereabout and lead it to his own land and by merchandising it prevent its return is however reasonable it may appear to the defendant and its customers unreasonable as to the plaintiff and the others whose lands are thus clandestinely sapped and their value impaired Forbell v New York 164 N Y 522 51 L R A 695 79 Am St Rep

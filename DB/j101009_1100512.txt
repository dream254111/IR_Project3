APPEAL FROM A DECREE OF THE CIRCUIT COURT OF AUGUSTA COUNTY PRO NOUNCED JULY 3 1901 IN A SUIT IN CHANCERY WHEREIN THE APPELLEE WAS THE COMPLAINANT AND THE APPELLANT WAS THE DEFENDANT REVERSED THE OPINION STATES THE EASE GEORGE G GRATTAN FOR THE APPELLANT PATRICK  GORDON FOR THE APPELLEE CARDWELL J DELIVERECD THE OPINION OF THE COURT THE BILL IN THIS CASE FILED BY APPELLEE A CORPORATION AND THE COM PLAINANT IN THE COURT BELOW ALLEGES THAT IT AND THE DEFENDANT BELOW APPELLANT HERE ARE THE OWNERS OF TWO ADJOINING TRACTS OF LAND LYING ON THE SLOPE OF THE BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS NEAR THE DIVIDING LINE BETWEEN THE COUNTIES OF ROCKINGHAM AND AUGUSTA THE PROPERTY OF EACH BEING USED AS A SUMMER RESORT OR WATERING PLACE THAT SOON AFTER APPELLEE WAS INCORPORATED AND PURCHASED ITS TRACT OF LAND A QUESTION AROSE BETWEEN IT AND APPELLANT AS TO THE OWNERSHIP OF TWO SPRINGS THE SMALLER ONE A MINERAL SPRING SITUATED NEAR THE DIVIDING LINE BETWEEN THE TWO PROPERTIES THAT LITIGATION WAS THE RESULT OF THIS CONTROVERSY AND IT WAS FINALLY DECIDED THAT THE SPRINGS WERE UPON THE LAND OF APPELLEE AND APPELLANT WAS RESTRAINED BY INJUNCTION IN 1893 FROM USING THE WATER FROM THE SPRINGS C AND THAT THEREAFTER APPELLANT MADE SEVERAL FRUITLESS EFFORTS TO SECURE THE USE OF THESE WATERS FOR HIS558 7 VIRGLINIA LAW REGISTER DEC BOARDINGHOUSE AND HIS GUESTS THE BILL THEN CONCLUDES AS FOLLOWS FINDING THAT HE HAD FINALLY TO GIVE UP THE USE OF THESE WATERS BY OPEN MEANS ABOVE THE SURFACE MILLER APPELLANT HAS RECENTLY UNDER TAKEN TO TAP THE SPRINGS BY A DITCH ALONG CLOSE TO THE LINE BETWEEN THE TWO PROPERTIES WHICH DIGGING HAS BEEN DONE IN THE COUNTY OF AUGUSTA BY THIS MEANS HE HAS CROSSED THE SOURCES OF ONE OF THE SPRINGS AND TURNED IT INTO THE DITCH HE HAS DUG AND CARRIED IT DOWN TO HIS OWN PROPERTY SO MUCH SO THAT THE SPRING HAS ALMOST ENTIRELY CEASED TO FLOW AND YOUR ORATOR IS ADVISED THAT HE IS GOING ON IN HIS SEARCH FOR THE OTHER ONE THIS IS NOT ONLY AN INVASION OF YOUR ORATORS PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE DIVERSION OF WATER WHOSE NATURAL FLOW IS ON THE LANDS OF THE ORATORS PROPERTY AS IT IS AT PRESENT USED AND AN ALMOST ABSOLUTE DESTRUCTION OF ITS VALUE FOR ANY PURPOSE IF THIS WATER IS ALLOWED TO BE TAKEN AWAY THE INJURY THUS WORKED TO YOUR ORATOR WOULD BE IRREPA RABLE C THE PRAYER IS FOR AN INJUNCTION TO RESTRAIN APPELLANT HIS AGENT C FROM DIGGING ON HIS OWN LAND SO AS TO STRIKE THE SOURCES OF THE SPRINGS WHICH RISE ON APPELLEES LAND OR FROM IN ANY WAY RE DUCING THE FLOW OF THE WATER THAT WOULD NATURALLY FLOW OUT AT THE SPRINGS OR FROM IN ANY WAY INTERFERING WITH APPELLEES USE OF SAID WATER WHETHER ABOVE OR BELOW THE GROUND THAT HE APPELLANT MAY BE REQUIRED PEREMPTORILY AT ONCE AND IF HE DOES NOT DO SO PROMPTLY THAT COMPLAINANT MAY BE PERMITTED TO GO ON HIS PREMISES AND FILL IN THE DITCH THAT HE HAS ALREADY DUG SO AS TO RESTORE SAID STREAM IF IT CAN POSSIBLY BE DONE TO ITS NATURAL FLOW C APPELLANT DEMURRED TO AND ANSWERED THE BILL AND IN HIS ANSWER ADMITS THE FORMER LITIGATION CONCERNING THE SPRING IN QUESTION RESULTING IN AN INJUNCTION RESTRAINING HIM FROM USING THE WATER THEREFROM AND THAT HE DID DIG UPON HIS OWN LAND TO OBTAIN WATER BUT CLAIMS THAT HE WAS SIMPLY DOING WHAT HE HAD A PERFECT RIGHT TO DO THAT HE WAS NOT SEEKING TO CUT OFF THE SOURCES OF ANY SPRING ON APPELLEES LAND THAT HE DID NOT KNOW AND COULD NOT TELL WHERE THE WATER WHICH FLOWED FROM APPELLEES SPRING CAME FROM BUT IF IT BE TRUE AS APPELLEE INFERS THAT IT COMES FROM APPELLANTS LAND HE WILL CERTAINLY BE ALLOWED A REASON ABLE USE OF WATERS FLOWING THROUGH HIS LAND WHETHER ABOVE OR BELOW THE SURFACE C HE FURTHER CLAIMS THAT HE DOES NOT KNOW NEITHER CAN ANY ONE SAY WHERE ARE THE SOURCES OF THESE SPRINGS OTHER THAN THE SPRINGS THEMSELVES AND THAT THE DIGGING HE DID ON HIS OWN LAND WAS NOT DONE TO VEX APPELLEE OR DONE WITH MALICE AND INTENT TO INJURE ITS PROPERTY BUT WAS SIMPLY DONE IN THE EXERCISE OF HIS LAWFUL RIGHTS ON HIS OWN SOIL IN ORDER TO PROCURE WATER FOR HIS OWN USE1901 MILLER V BLACK ROCK SPRINGS IMPROVEMENT CO 559 NO DISPOSITION SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN MADE OF THE DEMURRER TO THE BILL AND IT IS TO BE REGARDED AS OVERRULED MILLER V MILLER 93 VA 193 BUT THIS DOES NOT CONSTITUTE ERROR AS THE BILL UPON ITS FACE STATES A CASE FOR EQUITY JURISDICTION UPON HEARING THE CAUSE UPON THE BILL AND ANSWER AND THE DEPOSI TIONS OF WITNESSES THE CIRCUIT COURT BEING OF OPINION THAT THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE DIGGING COMPLAINED OF IN THE BILL WAS NOT PLAINLY SHOWN BY THE EVIDENCE ORDERED THAT THE COMPLAINANT APPELLEE TAKE FURTLHER EVIDENCE ON THIS POINT WHEREUPON ONLY THE DEPOSITION OF C S PATTERSON PRESIDENT OF THE APPELLEE COMPANY WHO HAD TWICE BEFORE TESTIFIED IN THE CAUSE WAS TAKEN AND UPON A FINAL HEARING THE DECREE APPEALED FROM WAS MADE PERPETUATING THE TEMPORARY INJUNCTION A GREAT NUMBER OF CASES HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED BY THIS COURT INVOLV ING THE CORRELATIVE RIGHTS OF ADJOINING OWNERS OF LAND IN REFERENCE TO RUNNING STREAMS ON THE SURFACE BUT THE QUESTION PRESENTED IN THIS CASE HAS NOT HERETOFORE BEEN CONSIDERED IN FRAZIER V BROWN 12 OHIO ST REP 294 THE FACTS WERE ALMOST IDENTICAL WITH THOSE APPEARING IN THIS RECORD AND IN AN ABLE AND EXHAUSTIVE OPINION CONCURRED IN BY THE ENTIRE COURT IT WAS HELD 1 THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPRESS CONTRACT AND POSITIVE LEGISLATION AS BETWEEN PROPRIETORS OF ADJOINING LANDS THE LAW RECOGNIZES NO CORRELA TIVE RIGHTS IN RESPECT TO UNDERGROUND WATERS PERCOLATING OOZING OR FILTERING THROUGH THE EARTH HENCE WHERE A LANDOWNER DIGS A  HOLE  ON HIS OWN LAND FOR PURPOSES CONNECTED WITH THE USE OF HIS OWN LAND THEREBY CUTTING OFF OR DIVERTING UNDERGROUND WATERS WHICH HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO PERCOLATE OOZE THROUGH HIS LAND TO THE LAND OF AN ADJOINING PROPRIETOR AND THERE FORM THE SOURCE

THE ACT WAS DONE IS A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE THE QUESTION WAS LEFT OPEN IN THAT CASE WHETHER IT WOULD HAVE MADE ANY DIFFERENCE IN LAW IF THE  HOLE  HAD BEEN DUG FROM MOTIVES OF UN MIXED MALICE AND WAS DESIGNED FOR NO PURPOSE OF EITHER ORNAMENT OR USE A LARGE NUMBER OF CASES ARE TO BE FOUND AND SOME OF THEM ARE CITED FOR APPELLEE IN WHICH IT WAS HELD THAT OWNER OF AN ADJOINING TRACT OF LAND BY DIGGING THEREON CANNOT DIVERT THE WATER FROM HIS NEIGHBORS SPRING OR WELL IF THE DIGGING IS DONE WITH MALICE OR WITH THE INTENT TO DEPRIVE HIS NEIGHBOR OF THE WATER BUT THEY HAVE NO APPLICATION TO THIS560 7 VIRGINIA LAW YEGISTER DEC CASE AS IT IS NEITHER ALLEGED NOR PROVED THAT THE ACTS OF THE APPELLANT WERE DONE EITHER MALICIOUSLV OR WITH INTENT ONLY TO DEPRIVE APPELLEE OF THE FLOW OF WATER TO ITS SPRING THE OPINION IN FRAZIER V BROWN SUPRA SAYS  IN CONSIDERING THE RELATIVE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF OWNERS OF ADJOINING LANDS IN RESPECT TO WATER PASSING FROM THE LANDS OF ONE TO THOSE OF THE OTHER THE SUB JECT NATURALLY DIVIDES ITSELF INTO FOUR BRANCHES OF ENQUIRY AND THIS ON ACCOUNT OF THE FOUR DIFFERENT MODES IN WHICH WATER MAY AND SOMETIMES DOES PASS FROM ONE TRACT TO ANOTHER 1 IN

FILTER FROM THE LANDS OF ONE OWNER TO THE LANDS OF ANOTHER  THE WHOLE SUBJECT IN ALL OF ITS BRANCHES IS GOVERNED BY TWO GENERAL AND FUNDAMENTAL MAXIMS WHICH ARE FIRST THAT THE ESTATE USUFRUCT AND DOMINION OF THE OWNER OF LANDS EXTENDS FROM THE SKY TO THE LOWEST DEPTHS OF THE EARTH SECOND THAT EVERY MAN SHALL SO USE HIS OWN AS NOT TO INJURE HIS NEIGHBOR THESE MAXIMS HOWEVER LIKE MOST GENERAL RULES ARE IN THEIR APPLICATION SUBJECT TO MODIFICATIONS OR EXCEPTIONS GROWING OUT OF CERTAIN GREAT PRINCIPLES OF NATURAL RIGHT ANTERIOR IN THEIR ORIGIN AND SUPERIOR IN THEIR OBLIGATION TO ALL INDIVIDUAL PROPRIETORSHIP OUT OF CERTAIN PARAMOUNT CONSIDERATIONS OF PUBLIC POLICY AND FROM THE ESTABLISHED PRINCIPLES THAT HOWEVER GREAT OR OBVIOUS THE DAMAGE MAY BE THE LAW WILL REGARD AS AN INJURY THAT ONLY WHICH CONTRAVENES OR INTERFERES WITH A RECOGNIZED RIGHT IN THE CASE BEFORE US WE ARE ONLY CONCERNED WITH THE FOURTH BRANCH OF INQUIRY MENTIONED ABOVE TOWIT SUBSURFACE WATERS WHICH WITHOUT ANY PERMANENT DISTINCT OR DEFINITE CHANNEL PERCOLATE IN MERE VEINS OOZE OR FILTER FROM THE LANDS OF ANOTHER THE BILL DOES ALLEGE THAT THERE ARE TWO SPRINGS UPON APPELLEES LAND SUPPLIED WITH WATER COMING FROM APPELLANTS LAND AND WHICH ARE IN1901 MILLER V BLACK ROCK SPRINGS IMPROVEMENT CO 561 FACT THE ONLY VALUE THAT THE PROPERTY OF APPELLEE HAS SO THAT TO BE IN ANY WAY DEPRIVED OF THESE SPRINGS WOULD BE PRACTICALLY TO BE DEPRIVED OF THE PROPERTY BUT AS WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN IT IS NOT ALLEGED THAT THE WATER THE OBSTRUCTION AND DETENTION OR DIVERSION OF WHICH IS COM PLAINED OF REACHES APPELLEES LAND FROM THE LANDS OF THE APPELLANT IN ANY DISTINCT DEFINITE OR KNOWN CHANNEL EITHER BOVE OR BELOW THE SNRFACE WHAT THEN IS THE PROOF AS TO THE CHARACTER OF THE SUPPLY OF WATER TO THE SPRING ALLEGED TO HAVE BEEN DESTROYED OR INJURED BY THE ACTS OF APPELLANT  MUCH TESTIMONY WAS INTRODUCED FOR APPELLEE TO SHOW THE CONDUCT OF APPELLANT IN ATTEMPTING TO OBTAIN THE USE OF THE WATER FROM THE SPRINGS AND AS TO THE DIGGING OF THE DITCH ALONG OR NEAR THE DIVIDING LINE BE TWEEN THE TWO PROPERTIES AND ITS EFFECT UPON THE SMALLER OF THE SPRINGS WHICH IS SITUATED FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN FEET FROM THE DIVIDING LINE BUT VERY LITTLE TESTIMONY AS TO THE CHARACTER OF THE SUPPLY OF WATER TO THE SPRING INSTEAD OF SHOWING THAT THE SUPPLY OF WATER TO THE SPRING IS THROUGH A DISTINCT DEFINITE OR KNOWN CHANNEL THE REVERSE IS THE EFFECT OF THE TESTIMONY C S PATTERSON PRESIDENT OF THE APPELLEE COMPANY TESTIFYING IN ITS BEHALF DESCRIBES THE PREMISES AND THE DITCH DUG BY APPELLANT AND BOTH HE AND OTHER WITNESSES SAY THAT THE WATER IN THE SMALLER OF THE SPRINGS WAS SO REDUCED AND LOWERED BY THE DIGGING OF THE DITCH AND THE GATH ERING OF THE WATER IN IT THAT THE WATER WOULD NOT RUN OUT OF THE SPRING THE DITCH IS DESCRIBED AS BEGINNING WITH THE TOP OF THE GROUND AND RUNNING INTO THE SLOPE OF THE MOUNTAIN THIRTY FEET AND OF A DEPTH OF FROM EIGHT TO TEN FEET WHERE IT STOPS ABOVE THE SPRING THE WITNESS PATTERSON WAS ASKED IF THE WATER CAME INTO THE DITCH AT THE POINT WHERE IT STOPPED AND HIS ANSWER WAS  THE WATER CAME IN ALONG THE SIDE AND CONTINUED ON AS FAR AS HE DUG THE DITCH THIS IS PRACTICALLY ALL THE TESTIMONY IN THE RECORD AS TO THE CHARACTER OF THE SUPPLY OF WATER TO THE SPRING IN QUESTION THE APPELLANT IN HIS ANSWER SAYS THAT HE DUG UPON HIS OWN LAND TO OB TAIN WATER THAT HE WAS SIMPLY 01OING WHAT HE HAD A PERFECT RIGHT TO DO THAT HE WAS NOT SEEKING TO CUT OFF THE SOURCES OF ANY SPRING ON APPEL LEES LAND THAT HE DID NOT KNOW AND COULD NOT TELL WHERE THE WATER WHICH FLOWED FROM APPELLEES SPRING CAME FROM BUT IF IT BE TRUE AS INFERRED BY APPELLEE THAT IT CAME FROM APPELLANTS LAND HE WOULD CERTAINLY BE ALLOWED A REASONABLE USE OF IT C IN HIS DEPOSITION HE SAYS THAT HE STARTED THE DIGGING UPON HIS OWN LAND WITH THE VIEW OF562 7 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER DEC PUTTING IN A PAIR OF STEPS BUT AFTER GOING IN A FEW FEET HE STRUCK WATER AND CONCLUDED TO OPEN UP A SPRING THAT WHEN HE DISCOVERED THERE WAS A PROSPECT FOR WATER AT THAT POINT AND BEGAN TO OPEN IT UP HE BAD NO INTENTION WHATEVER OF CUTTING THE SOURCES OF APPELLEES SPRINGS AS HE DID NOT KNOW WHERE THE SOURCES OF THE SPRINGS WERE NOR DID HE INTEND TO INJURE APPELLEE IN ANY WAY BUT ONLY INTENDED TO ADD TO THE VALUE OF HIS OWN PROPERTY AND TO HIS OWN COMFORT THERE IS TESTIMONY FOR APPELLEE TENDING TO SHOW THAT APPELLANTS STATEMENT AS TO WHY HE BEGAN THE DIGGING ON HIS LAND WAS UNTRUE THAT THERE WAS BAD FEELING BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND THAT APPELLANT WAS ACTUATED BY MALICE IN DIGGING THE DITCH BUT IT IS WE THINK IRRELE VANT THE SIMPLE QUESTION MADE BY THE PLEADING IS DID APPELLANT HAVE A LAWFUL RIGHT TO DO WHAT APPELLEE COMPLAINS OF  COOLEY IN HIS WORK ON TORTS 2D ED 689 SAYS IF ONE BY EXCAVATION ON HIS OWN LAND DRAWS OFF THE SUBTERRANEOUS WATERS FROM THE LANDS OF HIS NEIGHBORS TO THE PREJUDICE OF THE LATTER NO ACTION WILL LIE FOR THE CONSEQUENT DAMAGES THIS IS FULLY SETTLED IN ENGLAND BY THE LEADING CASE OF ACTON V BLUNDELL 12 M  W 324 AND IN A LATER CASE IT IS DECIDED THAT PROSPECTIVE RIGHTS CANNOT BE GAINED IN SUBTERRANEOUS WATERS WHICH WILL PRECLUDE SUCH EXCAVATIONS ON ADJOIN ING GROUNDS AS MAY DRAW THEM OFF THESE DECISIONS HAVE BEEN GENER ALLY FOLLOWED IN THIS COUNTRY AND IT MAY BE CONSIDERED SETTLED LAW THAT IF THE WELL DUG BY ONE MAN RUINS THE WELL OR SPRING OF HIS NEIGHBOR BY DRAWING OFF ITS WATER IT IS DAMNUM ABSQUE INJURIA PROBABLY IF THE SUBTERRANEOUS WATER WERE A STREAM FLOWING IN A WELLKNOWN COURSE IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT AND ONE THROUGH WHOSE LAND IT FLOWED WOULD BE PROTECTED AGAINST ITS BEING DRAWN AWAY FROM HIM BUT ONE CLAIMING RIGHTS IN SUCH A STREAM WOULD BE UNDER THE NECESSITY OF PROVING ITS EXISTENCE AND TRACING IT NOT AN EASY TASK IN ANY CASE IN GOULD ON WATERS 3D

ONLY DIFFERENCE IN THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW TO SURFACE AND SUB SURFACE STREAMS IS IN ASCERTAINING THE CHARACTER OF THE STREAM IF IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT THE WATERS WHICH CAME TO THE SURFACE ARE

SUBTERRANEOUS FLOW OF WATER MAY1901 MILLER V BLACK ROCK SPRINGS IMPROVEMENT CO 565 IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES POSSESS THE VERY CHARACTERISTICS OF WATER RUNNING ON THE SURFACE BUT IN MY OPINION WATER WHETHER FALLING FROM THE SKY OR ESCAPING FROM A SPRING WHICH DOES NOT FLOW ONWARD WITH ANY CON TINUITY OF PARTS BUT BECOMES DISSIPATED IN THE EARTHS STRATA AND SIMPLY PERCOLATES THROUGH OR ALONG THOSE STRATA UNTIL IT ISSUES FROM THEM AT A LOWER LEVEL THROUGH DISLOCATION OF THE STRATA OR OTHERWISE CANNOT WITH ANY PROPRIETY BE DESCRIBED AS A I STREAM  IN ROATH V DRISOLL SUPRA IT IS SAID WATER WHETHER

UNDERGROUND SOURCES OF SUPPLY IN OPINIONS BY TWO OF THE JUDGES AFFIRMING THE JUDGMENT OF THE LOWER COURT DISMISSING THE PLAINTIFFS COMPLAINT NEARLY ALL THE AUTHORITIES BEARING UPON THE QUESTION ARE REVIEWED AND IT WAS HELD THAT THE WEIGHT OF AUTHORITY CLEARLY SUSTAINED THE RIGHT OF THE DEFENDANT TO DIG IN HIS OWN LAND TO OBTAIN WATER FOR PROPER AND NECESSARY USES AT HIS HOUSE AND BARN EVEN IF BY SO DOING HE MATERIALLY INTERFERED WITH THE NATURAL FLOW OF WATER FROM THE SPRINGS ISSUING FROM THE LANDS OF THE PLAINTIFF ADJOINING THE DEFENDANTS PREMISES THAT THE QUESTION WAS NOT WHETHER THE PLAINTIFF COULD MAINTAIN AN ACTION AGAINST THE DEFENDANT FOR DAMAGES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR WANT OF DUE CARE IN DIGGING IN HIS LAND CLOSE TO THE LINE OF PLAINTIFFS LAND BUT WAS WHETHER THE DEFENDANT SHOULD BE RESTRAINED FROM DIGGING IN HIS LAND WHATEVER HIS OBJECT OR MOTIVES WERE TO THE INJURY OF THE PLAINTIFFS SPRINGS THE OPINION OF566 7 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER DEC BALCOM J CONCLUDES  IF THE DEFENDANT WERE LIABLE FOR DIGGING IN HIS LAND FOR WATER FOR DOMESTIC OR AGRICULTURAL PURPOSES NEAR THE LINE OF THE PLAINTIFFS LAND OUT OF WHICH THESE SPRINGS ISSUE BECAUSE SUCH DIGGING MATERIALLY LESSENED OR PREVENTED THE FLOW OF WATER FROM SUCH SPRINGS THEN HE AND ALL OTHERS WOULD BE LIABLE FOR DIGGING FOR A LIKE PROPER PURPOSE IN THEIR LANDS THOUGH A HALF MILE FROM PLAINTIFFS SPRINGS PROVIDED SUCH DIGGING WOULD PREVENT THE WATER ISSUING FROM SUCH SPRINGS SUCH A RULE WOULD CREATE MORE VEXATION THAN IT WOULD DO GOOD AND IT MIGHT BECOME INTOLERABLE THE WEIGHT OF AUTHORITY IS OPPOSED TO SUCH A RULE

WELL OF HIS NEIGHBOR1901 MILLER V BLACK ROCK SPRINGS IMPROVEMENT CO 567 SUCH UNDERGROUND WATERS ARE AS MUCH THE PROPERTY OF THE OWNERS OF THE LAND AS THE ORES ROCKS ETC BENEATH THE SOIL THE TEXT IS SUP PORTED BY A GREAT NUMBER OF AUTHORITIES CITED IN THE WELL REASONED OPINION OF LEWIS C J IN WHEATLEY V BAUGH UPRA IT IS SAID  WHEN THE FILTRATIONS ARE GATHERED INTO SUFFICIENT VOLUME TO HAVE AN APPRECIABLE VALUE AND TO FLOW IN A CLEARLY DEFINED CHANNEL IT IS GENERALLY POSSIBLE TO SEE IT AND TO AVOID DIVERTING IT WITHOUT SERIOUS DETRIMENT TO THE OWNER OF THE LAND THROUGH WHICH IT FLOWS BUT PERCOLATIONS SPREAD IN EVERY DIRECTION THROUGH THE EARTH AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID DISTURBING THEM WITHOUT RELINQUISHING THE NECESSARY ENJOYMENT OF THE LAND ACCORDINGLY THE LAW HAS NEVER GONE SO FAR AS TO RECOGNIZE IN ONE MAN THE RIGHT TO CONVERT ANOTHERS FARM TO HIS OWN USE FOR THE PURPOSES OF FILTER SUCH A CLAIM IF SUS TAINED WOULD AMOUNT TO A TOTAL ABROGATION OF THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY NO MAN COULD DIG A CELLAR OR A WELL OR BUILD A HOUSE ON HIS OWN LAUD BECAUSE THESE OPERATIONS NECESSARILY INTERCEPT THE FILTRATIONS THROUGH THE EARTH NOR COULD HE CUT DOWN THE FOREST AND CLEAR HIS LAND FOR THE PURPOSES OF HUSBANDRY BECAUSE THE EVAPORATION WHICH WOULD BE CAUSED BY EXPOSING THE SOIL TO THE SUN AND AIR WOULD INEVITABLY DIMIN ISH TO SOME EXTENT THE SUPPLY OF WATER WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE FILTER THROUGH IT HE COULD NOT OVERTURN A FURROW FOR AGRICULTURAL PURPOSES BECAUSE THIS WOULD PARTIALLY PRODUCE THE SAME RESULT EVEN IF THIS RIGHT WERE ADMITTED TO EXIST THE DIFFICULTY IN ASCERTAINING THE FACT OF ITS VIOLATION AS WELL AS THE EXTENT OF IT WOULD BE INSURMOUNTABLE THERE IS RESPECTABLE AUTHORITY AND SEVERAL OF THE CASES ARE CITED FOR APPELLEE SEEMINGLY IN CONFLICT WITH THOSE WE HAVE REFERRED TO ABOVE BUT THEY ARE CASES IN WHICH THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES WERE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE IN THIS CASE THEY ARE CASES IN WHICH THE STREAM IN QUESTION THOUGH SUBTERRANEAN WAS WELL DEFINED AND CAME MORE PROPERLY UNDER THE RULES OF LAW APPLICABLE TO SURFACE WATER OR IN WHICH THE ACTS COMPLAINED OF WERE DONE MALICIOUSLY OR WITH THE SOLE PURPOSE ON THE PART OF ONE LANDOWNER TO DEPRIVE ANOTHER LANDOWNER HIS NEIGHBOR OF THE SUPPLY OF WATER TO HIS SPRING OR WELL IN THIS CASE IF APPELLANT HAD DUG A WELL ON HIS OWN LAND FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING A SUPPLY OF WATER FOR HIS OWN USE THE RESULT OF WHICH WAS TO DRY UP THE SPRING ON APPELLEES LAND IT WOULD NOT BE CONTENDED THAT APPELLEE WOULD HAVE HAD A CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST APPELLANT FOR SO DOING IT IS ALSO UNNECESSARY TO CITE AUTHORITY FOR THE PROPOSITION THAT IF THE SUPPLY OF THE SPRING IN QUESTION IS BY A WELLDEFINED STREAM OF WATER COMING FROM THE LANDS OF AUPELLANT THOUGH SUBSURFACE568 7 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER DEC

IF IT APPEARED THAT THE SUPPLY OF THE SPRING WAS THROUGH A WELLDEFINED CHANNEL WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN PRESERVED WITHOUT DETRIMENT TO APPEL LANTS PROPERTY THROUGH WHICH IT FLOWED AS WELL AS THE QUESTION WHETHER IF THE INTERFERENCE WITH THE SOURCES OF THE SPRING WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO MALICE OR NEGLIGENCE ARE QUESTIONS NOT BEFORE US WE ARE UNABLE TO SEE FROM THE EVIDENCE IN THE CASE THAT APPELLANT HAS BEEN GUILTY OF ANY ACT BEYOND THE LAWFUL USE OF HIS OWN PROPERTY AND ARE THEREFORE OF OPINION THAT THE DECREE APPEALED FROM MUST BE REVERSED AND ANNULLED AND THIS COURT WILL ENTER SUCH DECREE AS THE

SUSTAIN THE COURT OR OTHERWISE SUCH OPINIONS REQUIRE MORE TIME AND CARE IN THEIR PREPARATION AND TAKE UP MORE SPACE IN THE REPORTS BUT THEY RENDER ERRO LESS PROBABLE THEY INVITE THE CONFIDENCE OF THE BAR AND CONTRIBUTE SOMETHING TO THE SCIENCE OF THE LAW IT IS TO BE OBSERVED THAT THE REAL POINT DECIDED IN THIS CASE IS THAT THE ADJOINING OWNER MAY REASONABLY AND FOR A PROPER PURPOSE INTERRUPT THE FLOW OF HIS NEIGH BORS SPRING BY DIGGING ON HIS OWN PROPERTY WHEN THE SPRING IS FED BY PERCOLATION THERE IS MUCH SAID IN THE NUMEROUS QUOTATIONS FROM OTHER OPINIONS AS TO SUBTER RANEAN WATERS FLOWING IN DEFINED STREAMS BUT THE DECISION IS EXPRESSLY BASED ON THE FACT THAT THE INTERCEPTED WATER WAS NOT FLOWING IN A DEFINED SUBTERRANEAN CHANNEL BUT WAS PERCOLATING WATER ONLY MUCH MORE DIFFICULTY IS

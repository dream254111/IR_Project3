HENRY CLAY IN WHOSE BEHALF HE MADE A NUMBER OF SPEECHES IN THE POLKCLAY CAMPAIGN FOR THE PRESIDENCY BUT THE OVERWHELMING DEFEAT OF HIS POLITICAL IDOL TO USE HIS OWN EXPRESSION SOMEWHAT SOBERED HIM AND HE THEREAFTER REFRAINED FROM ACTIVE POLITICS NOW OLD WHIGS AND OLD DEMOCRATS WERE UNITED UNDER THE COMPROMISE NAME OF CONSERVATIVE WITH A COMMON DESIRE TO REHABILI TATE THE STATE WHICH THEY ALL LOVED AND TO ALLEVIATE AS FAR AS POSSIBLE BY WISE LEGISLATION THE MISFORTUNES WHICH HAD COME IN THE WAKE OF WAR SUCH MEN AS JUDGE KELLY WERE ESPECIALLY NEEDED FOR THE SUC CESSFUL ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THIS UNDERTAKING HE ACCEPTED THE NOMI NATION ON CONDITION THAT HE WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO MAKE A PERSONAL CANVASS WHICH CONDITION WAS READILY ACCEDED TO BY THE CONVENTION AS THE PARTY IT REPRESENTED HAD AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY IN THE COUNTY AFTER HIS NOMINATION HOWEVER A GENTLEMAN OF HIS OWN PARTY AND THE EDITOR OF THE ONLY NEWSPAPER THEN PUBLISHED IN THE COUNTY ANNOUNCED HIMSELF AN INDEPENDENT CANDIDATE AND THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF HIS PAPER MADE SUCH AN ATTACK ON THE NOMINEE THAT THE FRIENDS OF THE LATTER URGED HIM TO CHALLENGE THE INDEPENDENT FOR A JOINT DISCUSSION TO BE HELD AT THE COURTHOUSE ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE NEXT TERM OF THE COUNTY COURT THE CHALLENGE WAS MADE AND ACCEPTED AND THE SPEECH MADE BY JUDGE KELLY ON THAT OCCASION IS ONE OF THE TRADITIONS OF THE COUNTY HE SUR

RECOLLECTIONS OF THE LIFE AND CHARACTER OF JUDGE JOHN A KELLY FROM THE TIME I CAME TO THE BAR MORE THAN A QUARTER OF A CENTURY AGO I 726 MARCHJUDGE JOHN A KELLY KNEW JUDGE KELLY INTIMATELY AND IT WAS MY PRIVILEGE TO ENJOY HIS CLOSE AND WARM FRIENDSHIP AS LONG AS HE LIVED  IN ALL THE AVENUES OF LIFE JUDGE KELLY MEASURED UP TO THE HIGHEST STANDARD OF MANHOOD AND WALKED UPRIGHTLY BEFORE GOD AND HIS FELLOW MAN HE NEVER COMPROMISED WITH DUTY BUT FEARLESSLY CONSCIEN TIOUSLY AND FIRMLY PERFORMED IT WITHOUT FLINCHING  AS A JUDGE HE WAS PREEMINENT IN EVERY ATTRIBUTE REQUISITE TO THE SUCCESSFUL ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE FEW LAWYERS NOW PRACTISING AT THE BAR HAVE ANY ADEQUATE CONCEPTION OF THE DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED BY THE JUDGES WHO CAME TO THE BENCH AT THE TIME JUDGE KELLY WAS ELECTED THE COUNTRY HAD JUST EMERGED FROM A DEVASTATING WAR WHICH HAD UPROOTED THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY AND DESTROYED HUNDREDS OF MIL LIONS OF OTHER PROPERTY LEAVING ALMOST EVERY FAMILY IN POVERTY AND MANY BANKRUPT STAYLAWS IN FORCE FOR SEVERAL YEARS EXPIRING WITH INCIDENT LITIGATION AND CONSTRUCTION TO BE GIVEN TO CONSTRACTS THERE UNDER OR SUSPENDED THEREBY A BANKRUPT LAW IN FORCE WITH NUMEROUS

TAKEN UNDER COLOR OF MILITARY AUTHORITY WITHOUT RIGHT AND HUNDREDS OF SIMILAR QUESTIONS NEARLY ALL OF FIRST IMPRESSION WERE PRESENTED TO THE COURTS FOR DECISION  DURING HIS FIRST TERM JUDGE KELLY HAD MORE NEW QUESTIONS TO DE CIDE THAN HAD BEEN PRESENTED TO HIS PREDECESSORS FOR FIFTY YEARS TO THE DISCHARGE OF THESE ONEROUS AND EXACTING DUTIES JUDGE KELLY BROUGHT A MIND WELL STORED WITH LEGAL LORE LOGICAL AND WELL DISCIPLINED METHODICAL HABITS OF STUDY AND MATURE JUDGMENT HIS BODY THOUGH NOT ROBUST HAD NEVER BEEN WEAKENED BY DISSIPATION AND HIS REGULAR HABITS ENABLED HIM TO UNDERGO FOR YEARS THE MOST EXACTING AND PROLONGED JUDICIAL WORK WITHOUT BREAKING DOWN JUDGE KELLY WENT UPON THE BENCH AT A TIME WHEN THE BAR NUM BERED AMONGST ITS MEMBERS MANY INTELLECTUAL GIANTS INCLUDING BEVERLY R

SHEFFEY AND JOHN W JOHNSTON ALL OF WHOM SAVE MR HAGAN PRECEDED HIM TO THE GRAVE WITH SUCH MEN AS THESE PRESENTING THE DIFFICULT QUESTIONS ARISING OUT OF THE CONDITIONS ABOVE REFERRED TO THE PRESIDING JUDGE WAS ALWAYS UPON HIS METTLE I HAVE LISTENED TO ARGUMENTS FROM THESE MEN THAT REMINDED ME OF THE WRESTLING OF GREEK ATHLETES MEN WITH MINDS DEEPLY IMBUED WITH THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE LAW DEPENDING MORE UPON THE BEDROCK OF ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES THAN CASELAW WHO MET AND CROSSED TRUE DAMASCUS BLADES WITH MATCHLESS SKILLMEN THE LIKE OF WHOM I FEAR I SHALL NEVER SEE AGAIN WITH SUCH A BAR PRESENTING SUCH QUESTIONS JUDGE KELLY WAS EASILY THE PEER OF ANY AND SAT UPON THE BENCH CALM DIGNIFIED AND SELFPOSSESSED AS READY AND ABLE TO DECIDE QUESTIONS AS THE BAR TO MAKE THEM JUDGE KELLY WAS THE MOST INDUSTRIOUS JUDGE I EVER KNEW EVERY CAUSE SUBMITTED TO HIM FOR DECISION WHETHER TRIVIAL IN AMOUNT OR INVOLVING A FORTUNE RECEIVED THE SAME CAREFUL AND PAINSTAKING INVESTI GATION AND WHEN HE HAD REACHED A CONCLUSION NEITHER THE RANK NOR STATION OF THE LITIGANT NOR THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS JUDGMENT CAUSED HIM TO WAVER FOR AN INSTANT BUT RESOLUTELY FACING THE RIGHT HIS DECISION WAS ANNOUNCED WHILST AS A JUDGE HE WAS UNMOVED BY ANY OTHER CONSIDERATION THAN TO PRONOUNCE THE JUDGMENT OF THE LAW UPON THE FACTS HE WAS NEVER DEVOID OF COMPASSION AND SYMPATHY FOR THE UNSUCCESSFUL LITIGANT I HAVE OFTEN GONE TO HIS CHAMBERS IN THE EVENING TO PRESENT CHANCERY ORDERS AND DECREES WHEN HE WOULD TURN FROM HIS WORK PLACE A CHAIR FOR ME AND SOON REVEAL THAT HIS HEART WAS TORN WITH ANGUISH AND SYMPATHY FOR SOME UNFORTUNATE LITIGANT AGAINST WHOM HE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO PRONOUNCE A DECREE RENDERING HIM HOMELESS OR PENNILESS HE WOULD GO OVER THE WHOLE CASE WITH ME IF I HAD NOT BEEN COUNSEL AND GIVE ME ALL THE REASONS FOR HIS CONCLUSIONS THESE INTERVIEWS BE CAME MORE FREQUENT AS I GREW OLDER AT THE BAR AND REVEALED TO ME THOSE TRAITS OF CHARACTER WHICH ENNOBLED THE MAN AND SUPPORTED THE JUDGE IN THE MANY TRYING DUTIES OF OFFICE JUDGE KELLY WAS MORALLY AS BRAVE AS A LION HE COULD NOT BE CAJOLED OR BROWBEATEN FLATTERED OR INTIMIDATED BUT WITH DIGNITY PURITY AND GREAT ABILITY DISCHARGED THE TRUST REPOSED IN HIM WITHOUT SWERVING ONE HAIRS BREADTH TO THE RIGHT OF LEFT THESE QUALITIES ENDEARED HIM NOT ONLY TO THE BAR BUT TO ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE LARGE CIRCUIT OVER WHICH HE PRESIDED AND HIS NAME IS TODAY A HOUSEHOLD WORD REVERED IN THE HOMES OF THE POOR AS WELL AS THE RICH AS A GREAT 728 MARCHJUDGE JOHN A KELLY AND GOOD MAN A FEARLESS AND UPRIGHT JUDGE AND FRIEND OF HIS FELLOW MAN AMONGST HIS WARMEST FRIENDS WERE NUMBERED MANY MEN AGAINST WHOM HE HAD DECIDED IMPORTANT CAUSES AND NO MATTER HOW BITTERLY DISAPPOINTED AT ANY DECISION NO LITIGANT WAS EVER KNOWN TO ASSAIL HIS INTEGRITY DURING HIS PROTRACTED SERVICE UPON THE BENCH HE CAME TO KNOW A GREAT MANY MEN IN HIS CIRCUIT AND UPON THE FIRST DAY OF COURT IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO GET TO THE COURTHOUSE OWING TO THE MANY PEOPLE WAITING TO SPEAK TO AND GREET HIM FOR ALL HE HAD A KIND AND CHEERY WORD AND FOR THOSE HE KNEW WELL HE ALWAYS ENQUIRED AS TO THEIR FAMILIES AND EXPRESSED WARM SYMPATHY FOR ANY BEREAVEMENT OR MIS FORTUNE FOR THESE TRAITS THE PEOPLE ALL LOVED HIM DEEPLY REGRETTED HIS RETIREMENT AND MOURNED HIS DEATH HE WAS BY NATURE GENTLE CONSIDERATE AND FORBEARING BUT WHEN NECESSARY NO MAN WAS MORE CLEARLY DIRECT AND EMPHATIC IN ADMINIS TERING A MERITED REBUKE OR UPHOLDING THE DIGNITY OF HIS COURT HE TOTALLY ABSTAINED FROM THE USE OF INTOXICANTS AND WAS ALWAYS OPPOSED TO THEIR USE OR SALE WITNESSES AND JURORS OCCASIONALLY CAME INTO COURT INTOXICATED AT WHICH HE WAS ALWAYS INDIGNANT GENERALLY IMPOS ING A FINE AND SENDING THE OFFENDER TO JAIL TO SOBER UP HOWEVER AS A RULE IF SUCH OFFENDER CAME INTO COURT THE NEXT MORNING REPENTANT AND SORRY THE FINE WAS REMITTED  JUDGE KELLY WAS A DEMOCRAT AND ALWAYS DEEPLY INTERESTED IN THE SUCCESS OF THE PARTY BUT AFTER HE WENT UPON THE BENCH HE DID NOT TAKE ANY ACTIVE PART IN POLITICS RARELY DISCUSSED POLITICAL QUESTIONS AND THEN ONLY IN PRIVATE WITH HIS INTIMATE FRIENDS DURING THE SPRING TERM OF LEE CIRCUIT COURT 1885 JUDGE KELLY SENT FOR ME ONE EVENING AND SURPRISED ME VERY MUCH BY ADVISING ME TO BECOME A CANDIDATE FOR ATTORNEYGENERAL SAYING THAT IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY I SHOULD NOT NEGLECT AND THAT I WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY BE NOMINATED AND ELECTED IF I BECAME A CANDIDATE I WAS DUBIOUS AT FIRST AND SUGGESTED MANY DIFFICULTIES SAYING I WAS TOO YOUNG HE COMBATTED EVERYTHING I ADVANCED SAYING THAT AT THAT JUNCTURE THE STATE NEEDED AN ACTIVE ENERGETIC AND AGGRESSIVE ATTORNEYGENERAL AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE NO FEAR OF ELECTION OR THE SUCCESSFUL DISCHARGE OF THE DUTIES OF THE OFFICE HE WAS VERY EARNEST AND AS MUCH INTERESTED AS A FATHER AND IT WAS LARGELY OWING TO HIS ADVICE THAT I BECAME A CANDIDATE MY ELECTION VERIFYING HIS POLITICAL SAGACITY IN THE OLD DAYS OF THE SADDLEBAG PRACTICE WHEN WE TRAVELLED ON HORSEBACK FROM COURT TO COURT JUDGE

PROFANITYINDEED NO ONE EVER ATTEMPTED A REPETITION OF SUCH AFTER ONE EXPERIENCE IN SITTING AROUND THE FIRESIDE AT THE COUNTRY HOUSES WHERE WE STOPPED IN GOING FROM COURT TO COURT THE PRESENCE OF JUDGE KELLY ALWAYS EXERCISED A WHOLESOME RESTRAINT UPON THE LAWYERS HE ENJOYED THEIR MERRIMENT AND FREQUENT HEATED DISCUS SIONS BUT THEY ALL REGARDED HIM TOO HIGHLY TO SAY AUGHT THAT WOULD BE DISAGREEABLE

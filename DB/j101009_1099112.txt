j101009,The Virginia Law Register,1099112,Judge John A Kelly,i245881,JUDGE JOHN A KELLYVIRGINIA LAW REGISTER VOL VI MARCH 1901 No 11 JUDGE JOHN A wTTT y Judge John Alexander Kelly was born in Lee county Virginia June 23 1821 and died at Marion Virginia November 17 1900 In early life by reason of financial reverses overtaking his father Judge Kelly was thrown upon his own resources and compelled to solve the problem of life on his own responsibility The first work which he undertook was carrying the mail on horseback over a rough mountainous route eighty miles in length He made the round trip in four days including Sundaythe other days of the week he utilized in attending school After being thus engaged for three years he changed his route for a shorter one which only required two days riding Saturday and Sunday thus giving him five days in the week at school The school he attended was at Abingdon and was taught by Mr J W Clapp who was afterwards a distinguished lawyer and member of Congress from Mississippi In writing of his schooldays at Abingdon Judge Kelly said During this period from observa tion of the dreadful consequences of the use of intoxicating drinks I was led to resolve never to use any intoxicant as a beverage This resolution since I was twelve years of age I have scrupulously kept At the age of sixteen he was offered and accepted a position in the office of the clerk of the courts of Russell county and spent a year in this work The clerk Rev James P Carroll was a man of consid erable wealth and was liberal with his means He was attracted by the industry and intelligence of his young prot6g and learning of his desire to obtain an education proposed to furnish the necessary money to send him to Emory and Henry College which institution had just been established in Washington county This offer Mr Carroll ac companied with the assurance that if health failed his young friend the money furnished him would be considered a gift otherwise it was to be a loan This generous proposition after some hesitation was accepted and6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER we find young Kelly in his seventeenth year a student at Emory and Henry which was then a manual labor school the students being re quired to work three hours each day for which they were paid five cents per hour Our young friend was made prefect of a company of twelve students and aided in leveling and grading the grounds around the main college building While at college he attained the highest grade in his class and was made tutor in Latin and Greek In 1841 his dread of accumulating a debt which he could not pay induced him to leave college before receiving his degree but some years afterwards the trustees conferred upon him the Masters degree honoris causa After leaving college he taught school for a time in Smyth and Giles counties and while teaching in the latter county began the study of law with Mr Samuel Pack a prominent lawyer with whom he after wards formed a partnership for the practice of his profession On ad mission to the bar in 1843 his practice extended to the counties of Giles Bland and Tazewell where he was thrown in contact with such legal luminaries as John B Floyd Benjamin R Floyd John W Johnston James W Sheffey Joseph Stras and others who were the peers of any lawyers Virginia has produced Nothing can be said more complimentary to Judge Kelly than that in the outset of his legal career he maintained himself with great credit among this galaxy of intellectual giants He was a natural lawyer endowed with a strong analytical mind which seemed to grasp intuitively legal principles and distinctions He mastered every question which presented itself in his practice and never went to trial without thorough preparation His practice in creased from the beginning and it is said he never lost a client who had once employed him In 1854 he was induced to accept the position of cashier of the Northwestern Bank of Virginia then the most important financial in stitution perhaps west of the Alleghanies The State of Virginia was largely interested in this bank and at the urgent solicitation of its officers Judge Kelly continued in his position as cashier during the civil war and had entire control of the banks affairs during that period The manner in which he discharged this trust during so try ing a period demonstrated his business ability and keen foresight as well as his fidelity to the interest of those who had entrusted their property to his keeping He saw that the fall of the Confederate States was probable and converted as far as practicable all of the 724 Marchassets of his bank into gold and deposited the gold in the Bank of Wheeling at Wheeling West Virginia As a result at the close of the war when all our financial institutions were wrecked and our cur rency made worthless the Northwestern Bank of Virginia had about 90000 deposited to its credit in a solvent bank which enabled it to pay all of its creditors in full and about sixty per cent to its stock holders on their capital stock This business acumen saved a number of our best citizens from bankruptcy and furnished the capital they so much needed to start afresh in retrieving fortunes laid waste by the ravages of war After the war closed Judge Kelly removed to Smyth county where he soon resumed the practice of his profession forming a partnership with the late Judge Robert A Richardson This firm enjoyed a lucrative practice in Smyth Bland and Tazewell counties being em ployed in almost every important case In 1869 Judge Kelly was urged to accept the nomination for repre sentative to the House of Delegates from Smyth county Politics was a new role for him to play Before the war he had been a Whig and was an ardent admirer of Henry Clay in whose behalf he made a number of speeches in the PolkClay campaign for the Presidency but the overwhelming defeat of his political idol to use his own expression somewhat sobered him and he thereafter refrained from active politics Now old Whigs and old Democrats were united under the compromise name of Conservative with a common desire to rehabili tate the State which they all loved and to alleviate as far as possible by wise legislation the misfortunes which had come in the wake of war Such men as Judge Kelly were especially needed for the suc cessful accomplishment of this undertaking He accepted the nomi nation on condition that he would not be required to make a personal canvass which condition was readily acceded to by the convention as the party it represented had an overwhelming majority in the county After his nomination however a gentleman of his own party and the editor of the only newspaper then published in the county announced himself an independent candidate and through the medium of his paper made such an attack on the nominee that the friends of the latter urged him to challenge the independent for a joint discussion to be held at the courthouse on the first day of the next term of the county court The challenge was made and accepted and the speech made by Judge Kelly on that occasion is one of the traditions of the county He sur prised friend and foe with his magnificent effort and the fire and force 1901 725 JUDGE JOHN A KELLY6 VIRGINIA LAW REGWilikR of its delivery He resented and denounced in indignant terms the newspaper attack made on him and in turn so effectively and merci lessly ridiculed and belittled the position of his opponent that he ceased to be a factor in the race and soon thereafter left the county Kelly was triumphantly elected his independent opponent receiving but forty votes in the county The legislature to which he was elected was one of the most important in the history of Virginia and in this body Judge Kelly took high rank being made chairman of one important committee and a mem ber of the committee on courts of justice At this session the judges for the circuit courts of the State were to be elected and Judge Kelly had so impressed the bar of his circuit with his ability and his peculiar fitness for judicial honors that he was urged to stand for election to the judgeship of the sixteenth circuit When his consent was obtained no one opposed him and he was unani mously elected The sixteenth circuit was then composed of the counties of Smyth Washington Russell Scott Lee Wise and Buch anan and to these Dickenson was added when that county was formed He qualified as judge on April 23 1870 and was continued in office without opposition until 1894 when he declined reelection In 1887 his circuit which was by far the largest in the State was divided and a new circuit the seventeenth was formed out of the counties of Lee Scott Wise Buchanan and Dickenson As a judge no eulogy could do Judge Kelly more than justice He was a model jurist and would have adorned any bench state or fed eral No man was ever better fitted for the high duties of his office no one ever discharged a trust more faithfully Learned diligent upright and pure it may be said of him as was said of the great Hardwicke that in the administration of his office he was likened to the personification of wisdom distributing justice and delivering instruction The following letter written by exAttorneyGeneral Rufus A Ayres who was one of Judge Kellys most intimate friends and who lived in his circuit before it was divided expresses so admirably my estimate of the man that I take the liberty of incorporating it in full in this sketch It would be impossible to compress in the scope of a letter my recollections of the life and character of Judge John A Kelly From the time I came to the bar more than a quarter of a century ago I 726 MarchJUDGE JOHN A KELLY knew Judge Kelly intimately and it was my privilege to enjoy his close and warm friendship as long as he lived  In all the avenues of life Judge Kelly measured up to the highest standard of manhood and walked uprightly before God and his fellow man He never compromised with duty but fearlessly conscien tiously and firmly performed it without flinching  As a judge he was preeminent in every attribute requisite to the successful administration of justice Few lawyers now practising at the bar have any adequate conception of the difficulties encountered by the judges who came to the bench at the time Judge Kelly was elected The country had just emerged from a devastating war which had uprooted the institution of slavery and destroyed hundreds of mil lions of other property leaving almost every family in poverty and many bankrupt staylaws in force for several years expiring with incident litigation and construction to be given to constracts there under or suspended thereby a bankrupt law in force with numerous distinctions as to jurisdiction arising thereunder and the effect of dis charges upon preexisting liens the settlement of estates which had been sold for Confederate money the scaling down and reducing to present value all obligations executed for the payment of money during the war the distinctions between contracts executed with reference to Confederate money as a standard of value and those executed with reference to specie as a standard of value often turning upon proof aliunde the writing the effect of obligations executed for the price of slaves the rights of action for property taken under color of military authority without right and hundreds of similar questions nearly all of first impression were presented to the courts for decision  During his first term Judge Kelly had more new questions to de cide than had been presented to his predecessors for fifty years To the discharge of these onerous and exacting duties Judge Kelly brought a mind well stored with legal lore logical and well disciplined methodical habits of study and mature judgment His body though not robust had never been weakened by dissipation and his regular habits enabled him to undergo for years the most exacting and prolonged judicial work without breaking down Judge Kelly went upon the bench at a time when the bar num bered amongst its members many intellectual giants including Beverly R Johnston William H Burns John A Campbell James W Humes Sydney S Baxter Peter C Johnston Joseph T Campbell Henry S Kane William B Aston M B D Lane Patrick Hagan 1901 7276 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER James W Sheffey and John W Johnston all of whom save Mr Hagan preceded him to the grave With such men as these presenting the difficult questions arising out of the conditions above referred to the presiding judge was always upon his mettle I have listened to arguments from these men that reminded me of the wrestling of Greek athletes men with minds deeply imbued with the philosophy of the law depending more upon the bedrock of elementary principles than caselaw who met and crossed true Damascus blades with matchless skillmen the like of whom I fear I shall never see again With such a bar presenting such questions Judge Kelly was easily the peer of any and sat upon the bench calm dignified and selfpossessed as ready and able to decide questions as the bar to make them Judge Kelly was the most industrious judge I ever knew Every cause submitted to him for decision whether trivial in amount or involving a fortune received the same careful and painstaking investi gation and when he had reached a conclusion neither the rank nor station of the litigant nor the consequences of his judgment caused him to waver for an instant but resolutely facing the right his decision was announced Whilst as a judge he was unmoved by any other consideration than to pronounce the judgment of the law upon the facts he was never devoid of compassion and sympathy for the unsuccessful litigant I have often gone to his chambers in the evening to present chancery orders and decrees when he would turn from his work place a chair for me and soon reveal that his heart was torn with anguish and sympathy for some unfortunate litigant against whom he had been compelled to pronounce a decree rendering him homeless or penniless He would go over the whole case with me if I had not been counsel and give me all the reasons for his conclusions These interviews be came more frequent as I grew older at the bar and revealed to me those traits of character which ennobled the man and supported the judge in the many trying duties of office Judge Kelly was morally as brave as a lion He could not be cajoled or browbeaten flattered or intimidated but with dignity purity and great ability discharged the trust reposed in him without swerving one hairs breadth to the right of left These qualities endeared him not only to the bar but to all the people of the large circuit over which he presided and his name is today a household word revered in the homes of the poor as well as the rich as a great 728 MarchJUDGE JOHN A KELLY and good man a fearless and upright judge and friend of his fellow man Amongst his warmest friends were numbered many men against whom he had decided important causes and no matter how bitterly disappointed at any decision no litigant was ever known to assail his integrity During his protracted service upon the bench he came to know a great many men in his circuit and upon the first day of court it was difficult for him to get to the courthouse owing to the many people waiting to speak to and greet him For all he had a kind and cheery word and for those he knew well he always enquired as to their families and expressed warm sympathy for any bereavement or mis fortune For these traits the people all loved him deeply regretted his retirement and mourned his death He was by nature gentle considerate and forbearing but when necessary no man was more clearly direct and emphatic in adminis tering a merited rebuke or upholding the dignity of his court He totally abstained from the use of intoxicants and was always opposed to their use or sale Witnesses and jurors occasionally came into court intoxicated at which he was always indignant generally impos ing a fine and sending the offender to jail to sober up However as a rule if such offender came into court the next morning repentant and sorry the fine was remitted  Judge Kelly was a Democrat and always deeply interested in the success of the party but after he went upon the bench he did not take any active part in politics rarely discussed political questions and then only in private with his intimate friends During the spring term of Lee circuit court 1885 Judge Kelly sent for me one evening and surprised me very much by advising me to become a candidate for AttorneyGeneral saying that it was an opportunity I should not neglect and that I would almost certainly be nominated and elected if I became a candidate I was dubious at first and suggested many difficulties saying I was too young He combatted everything I advanced saying that at that juncture the State needed an active energetic and aggressive attorneygeneral and that I should have no fear of election or the successful discharge of the duties of the office He was very earnest and as much interested as a father and it was largely owing to his advice that I became a candidate my election verifying his political sagacity In the old days of the saddlebag practice when we travelled on horseback from court to court Judge Kelly erect upon his large 1901 7296 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER gray horse was a familliar figure and he was generally first in at court or the stopping place It was during these long rides that I came to know him so intimately conversing hour after hour profiting greatly from his rich store of general information He enjoyed keenly an amusing anecdote but frowned upon anything approaching vul garity or profanityindeed no one ever attempted a repetition of such after one experience In sitting around the fireside at the country houses where we stopped in going from court to court the presence of Judge Kelly always exercised a wholesome restraint upon the lawyers He enjoyed their merriment and frequent heated discus sions but they all regarded him too highly to say aught that would be disagreeable unpleasant or deemed improper by him  It would require a book to recount the interesting incidents in Judge Kellys life the kind deeds the noble selfsacrificing spirit the solicitude for his family his friends the church the happiness of the people the enactment of wise legislation the prevention of oppression all found a place in his broad and generous nature He thoroughly impressed his character upon the people his good deeds live after him as a bright landmark pointing the coming generation to the paths of virtue and moral rectitude When the sixteenth circuit was divided the attorneys of the counties composing the new circuit prepared and had spread upon the records of their several courts expressions of their high appreciation of Judge Kellys services and on his final retirement every bar in his circuit passed resolutions in his honor Short extracts from some of these resolutions are given to show the universal esteem in which he was held by the profession It is with pleasure that we can give assurance that for him they entertain profound respect and veneration with admiration for his learning and ability as a judge and for his untiring energy and the unbiassed and impartial manner in which he at all times discharged his dutiesScott County Bar November 20 1886  No doubts have ever been entertained as to his motives no complaints have ever been uttered as to his fairness or of his failure to fully investigate and under stand before he decided We know not which most to commend to the future for imitation his ability his justice his indefatigable labor or his meek Christian lifeLee County Bar November 27 1886 It may be said of the members of the present bar that they have received their legal training in the courts held and presided over by Judge Kelly for in the innumerable decisions rendered by him he has expounded the law with such 730 MarchJUDGE JOHN A KELLY profound ability as to make it a law school for those who have had the pleasure of practicing in his courtsRussell County Bar November 10 1894 We regard him as one of the purest most learned conscientious and able of virginias jurists and on retiring from the bench it is no disparagement to the reputation and distinguished ability of Campbell Johnston Fulkerson Estill and others who were his predecessors in office to say that in all the attributes that go to make up a learned lawyer a conscientious impartial and learned jurist he was the peer of any of them   Socrates said Four things belong to a judge to hear cautiously to answer wisely to consider soberly and to decide impartially These four things have been characteristic of this beloved judge whose term of office is now soon to end Smyth County Bar December 8 1894 Such was John A Kelly the judge and this but measures the man In all the walks of life in church or state he was characterized by the same dignity purity and nobility In his home and domestic relations he was the idol of his wife and children who were in turn the recipients of his constant attention and loving care In 1843 Judge Kelly was married to Miss Martha M Peck the daughter of a prominent citizen of Giles county He was then twenty two years of age and his wife sixteen The union was a most happy one In writing of his wife after her death Judge Kelly said  My wife though so young soon developed so sound a judgment as that in this respect she wr3 to me invaluable but her devotion to my interests and happiness her cheerful willingness to make any sacrifice for her family her beautiful example before and skillful training of our children and especially our daughters were above all praise Her death on the 3d day of July 1890 was almost more than I could bear and it has cast a gloom over both my present and future After retiring from the bench Judge Kelly for a time devoted him self to the practice of law and would soon have had an extensive and lucrative business but his health failed him and at the solicitation of his children he gave up all work and spent his remaining days with themreceiving at their hands every care and attention that venera tion and love could suggest The news of his death while not unex pected was received with profound regret in a community where every one was his admirer and friend Thus closed the career of a man loved and revered for his learning his justice the example of his life and his sweet Christian character B F BUCHANAN Marion Va 1901 731

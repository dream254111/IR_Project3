TURIN SERVING TO DISCOVER THE TRUE SITUATION OF THE ANCIENT CITY INDUSTRIA BY DAVID ERSKINE BAKER DR JOSEPH LAURENTIUS BRU NI FELLOW OF OUR ROYAL SOCIETY AND PHYSICIAN OF THE COLLEGE AT TURIN HAVING IN THE MONTH OF MARCH 17445 SENT FROM THENCE TO MY FATHER THE DESCRIPTION OF A MOST CURI OUS ANTIQUE TRIPOS OF METAL FOUND SOME LITTLE WHILE BEFORE TOGETHER WITH A PLATE OF THE SAME BEARING AN EXTRAORDINARY INSCRIPTION THEREON AT A VILLAGE CALLD MONTEU ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE RIVER PO ABOUT 16 MILES FROM TURIN AND THE SAME GENTLEMAN HAVING LATELY SENT US LIKEWISE AN ITALIAN DISSERTATION PRINTED AT TURIN WHEREIN THE LEARNED AUTHORS PAUL RICOLVI AND ANTHONY RIVAUTELLA UNDERTAKE TO DISCOVER FROM THE SAID INSCRIPTION AND OTHER CONCURRING CIRCUMSTANCES THE TRUE PLACE OF THE ANCIENT CITY INDUSTRIA MENTIONED TWICE BY PLINY A SHORT ACCOUNT COLLECTED FROM THE WHOLE AND TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH MAY PROVE I HOPE NOT UNACCEPTABLE THIS IS AN ABSTRACT OF THE PAPER READ DEC 5 1745 THIS TRIPOS THEY SAY FAR EXCEEDS EVERY THING OF ITS KIND PRESERVED HITHERTO IN ANY OF THE CABINETS IN EUROPE AS WELL FOR ITS STRUCTURE AS FOR THE VA RIETY AND ELEGANCE OF THE SEVERAL RELIEVOS WHERE WITH IT IS ADORNED EACH OF ITS THREE PILLARS HAS ON IT FOUR SMALL FIGURES THE FIRST WHICH IS PLACED AT TOP REPRESENTS A TERMINUS OF VENUS THE SECOND IS A VICTORY541 VICTORY OR A WINGED FORTUNE RATHER STANDING WITH HER FEET UPON A GLOBE THE THIRD WHICH IS NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THE PILLAR IS AN HARPY WINGED WITH A WOMANS FACE AND THE FOURTH FIGURE AT THE FOOT OF THE PILLAR APPEARS TO BE AN OLD SILENUS OR SATYR CROUCHING HIMSELF TOGETHER IN AN ODD MANNER THE PILLARS ARE JOINED TO ONE ANOTHER BY LITTLE BARS OF METAL FASTENED BY RIVETS AT TOP AND RINGS AT BOTTOM IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THEY MAY BE CLOSED TOGETHER OR DRAWN ASUNDER AT PLEASURE AND WHEN THEY ARE EXTENDED TO THE UTMOST THE SIZE OF THE TRIPOS IS SOMEWHAT MORE THAN A TURIN FOOT WHICH DR BRUNI SAYS IS EQUAL TO TWENTY ENGLISH INCHES T A B L E 1 FIG 2 IS AN EXACT COPY OF THE INSCRI PTION ON THE METAL PLATE AS GIVEN BEFORE THE DIS SERTATION THE AUTHORS EXPLAIN THE READING OF EACH WORD AND GIVE THEIR COMMENTS THEREON TOGETHER WITH A LONG DESCRIPTION OF THE ROMAN CUSTOMS AND OFFICES WHICH BEING SUFFICIENTLY KNOWN I SHALL TAKE FROM THEM ONLY A BRIEF ABSTRACT OF SUCH PAS SAGES AS ARE LEAST EASY TO BE UNDERSTOOD THE FIRST OBSERVATION OF THIS KIND IS THAT WHEREAS IN OTHER INSCRIPTIONS IT IS USUAL TO FIND HONORI AND THEN THE NAME OF THE PERSON IN THE DATIVE CASE AS HONORI MEMMIO VITRASIO ORFITOA OR ELSE HONORI IM PERATORIS CAESARIS C OR AS IN ANOTHER STONE B IN HONOREM T CLAUDII IMPERATORIS AND CONSEQUENTLY THE TITLES OF THE PERSON IN THE GENITIVE CASE HERE AFTER HAVING SAID HONORI L POMPEI HERENNIANI WE FIND CURATORI AND PATRONO WHICH TWO WORDS MUST AGAIN A GRUT P 443 B MARM TAUR P 189542 AGAIN REFER TO THE WORDS GENIO  HONORI AND THEY MENTION ANOTHER INSCRIPTION WHERE A MISTAKE OF THE SAME KIND IS FOUND VIZ A HONORI M GAVIMF POPSQVILLANI EQ PVBIIIIVIRID IIIIVIRAPVB CVRATORIVICETINOR APPARITORESET LIMOCINCTI TRIBVNALISEIVS EQ ROM EQ PVB THESE WORDS INFER THAT LUCIUS POMPEIUS THE PERSON TO WHOSE HONOUR THIS PLATE IS INSCRIBD WAS A ROMAN KNIGHT WHO HAD A STIPEND FROM THE PUBLIC THE ROMAN KNIGHTS SERVED AT THEIR OWN EXPENCE TILL THE YEAR OF ROME 451 WHEN THEIR HORSES BEGAN FIRST TO BE MAINTAIND AT THE EXPENCE OF THE COMMON WEALTH AND IT APPEARS FROM VARIOUS INSCRIPTIONS UNDER THE EMPERORS THAT THE WORDS EQUES PUBLICUS EQUO PUBLICO DONATUS OR ORNATUS C ALWAYS MEAN A MILITARY DIGNITY AND MUST BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE ROMAN KNIGHTS TOWARDS THE END OF THE COM MONWEALTH WHO WERE A DEGREE OF CITIZENS BETWEEN THE SENATORS AND THE PLEBEIANS Q AER PET ALIM IT A MARM PISAUR P 17 N 38543 IT APPEARS HEREBY THAT LUCIUS POMPEIUS WAS QUAES TOR AERARII THO ONLY OF THE FINANCES OF THE CITY INDUSTRIA AND NOT OF THE EMPEROR UNDER WHOM HE LIVD BUT THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY ARISES FROM PET ALIM WHERE OUR AUTHORS SUPPOSE THE ENGRAVER MAY HAVE LEFT OUT THE STOP BETWEEN THE LETTER P AND THE LETTERS ET SO THAT WE SHOULD READ IT QUAES TORIS AERARII PUBLICI ET ALIMENTORUM AND THEN WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT DIGNITIES OF LUCIUS POMPEIUS THAT OF QUAESTOR OF THE PUBLIC TAXES AND THAT OF QUAESTOR OF THE PROVISIONS BOTH REGARDING THE CITY OF INDUSTRIA SEVERAL OTHER INSCRIPTIONS ARE ALSO PRO DUCD TO PROVE THE OFFICE OF QUAESTOR ALIMENTORUM AND A GREAT DEAL OF READING IS INTRODUCD TO SHEW THAT THE QUAESTOR ALIMENTORUM WAS SOME TIMES UNDERSTOOD TO BE AN OFFICER HAVING THE CARE OF THE PUBLIC ALLOWANCE FOR BRINGING UP CHIL DREN AND THAT AT OTHER TIMES HIS OFFICE WAS UN DERSTOOD TO BE THE PROCURING ALL SORTS OF PROVISIONS FOR THE USE OF THE EMPERORS TROOPS PASSING BY HIS OFFICE OF AEDILIS AND DUUMVIR WE FIND HE PRESIDED LIKEWISE OVER THE RECEIPT OF THE TAXES BY THIS ADDRESS TO HIM CVRATORI KALENDARIORVM REI P THE DAYS FIXED FOR PAYMENT OF THE TAXES AND DEBTS WERE REGISTERD IN THE PUBLIC CALENDARS AND CREDITORS USUALLY DEMANDED THEIR INTEREST ON THE KALENDS OR FIRST DAY OF EVERY MONTH WHENCE THE REGISTER OF THE DEBTORS AND THE SUMS DUE OR THE TRIBUTE TO BE PAID BY PARTICULARS TO THE PUBLIC AND INDEED THE GENERAL544 GENERAL STATE OF THE DEBTS AND CREDIT OF EVERY COM MUNITY CAME TO BE CALLED CALENDARIUM COLLEGIVM PASTOPHORORVM THE COLLEGE OF PRIESTS CALLED PASTOPHORI A NAME TAKEN AS SOME

HEREBY THE CITY INDUSTRIA ACKNOWLEDGES LUCIUS POMPEIUS AS ITS PATRON OR PROTECTOR AND SHEWS ITS GRATITUDE A LIB XI METAM 3545 GRATITUDE FOR SINGULAR BENEFITS RECEIVED PATRONS AND CLIENTS WERE IN THE EARLIEST TIMES OF THE COMMON WEALTH BUT UNDER THE EMPERORS INSCRIPTIONS SHEW US FREQUENTLY THAT CITIES AND NATIONS CHOSE FOR THEIR PATRON SOME EMINENT ROMAN CITIZEN IN FAVOUR WITH THE PRINCE ON WHOM THEY OFTEN CONFERRED GREAT HONOURS T GRAE TROPHIMVS IND FAC THESE WORDS ON THE CORNICE OUR AUTHORS WON DERED TO FIND AS IT WAS UNUSUAL FOR ANY BUT THE MOST EMINENT PAINTERS AND SCULPTORS TO PUT THEIR NAMES AND THAT ONLY TO THE MOST FAMOUS AND PERFECT OF THEIR WORKS WHENCE THEY CONJECTURE THAT THIS TITUS GRAECUS TROPHIMUS OF INDUSTRIA MIGHT BE NOT ONLY THE ENGRAVER OF THE INSCRIPTION BUT LIKEWISE THE SCULPTOR OF SOME IMAGE TO WHICH THIS MAY HAVE BEEN THE PEDESTAL THESE GENTLEMEN WHO ARE AUTHORS OF THE MAR MORA TAURINENSIA WENT TO THIS VILLAGE OF MONTEU IN THE AUTUMN OF THE YEAR 1743 WHERE THEY FOUND MANY INSCRIPTIONS WITH THE NAMES OF VARIOUS MA GISTRATES BOTH CIVIL AND CCCLESIASTICAL WHICH WERE CER TAIN PROOFS THAT SOME CONSIDERABLE CITY HAD BEEN IN THAT PLACE FORMERLY AND RETURNING THITHER THE AUTUMN FOLLOWING THEY FOUND A BROKEN STONE WHEREON BY PUTTING THE PIECES TOGETHER THEY COULD PLAINLY READ THAT THERE HAD BEEN DECREED TO A PERSON NAMED COCCEIA AT THE EXPENCE OF THE PUBLIC

THEY ALSO TAKE NOTICE THAT THE HILL NEAR THE PLAIN OF MONTEU IS CALLED MONDICOI WHICH THEY SUPPOSE A CORRUPTED REMAIN OF THE ANCIENT WORD BODINCOMAGUS THEY FIND LIKEWISE IN THE BULLS OF THIS PARISH

FIFTEENTH EDUCATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE ACADEMIES AND HIGH SCHOOLS AFFILI ATING OR COOPERATING WITH THE UNIVER SITY OF CHICAGO I EXECUTIVE SESSION OF DEANS AND PRINCIPALS THE fifteenth educational conference of the academies and high schools affiliating or cooperating with the University of Chicago opened as usual on November 8 with the executive session of deans and principals of the secondary schools with the board of affiliations of the university Certain committees had been appointed at the fourteenth conference to present further reports upon questions which were discussed at some length at that meeting SEPARATION OF STUDENTS INTO SECTIONS UPON BASIS OF SCHOLARSHIP The fourteenth conference had expressed a favorable opinion with reference to the separation of students into sections upon the basis of scholarship and appointed a committee to make suggestions for the practical carrying out of this plan Mr J O Leslie reported for the committee the following recommenda tions i That where the classes entering high schools are large enough to make three or more sections of say thirty pupils each these sections be based tem porarily on scholarship as shown by the work done in the grades in mathe matics and language studyTHE SCHOOL RE VIEW 2 That after pupils have been in the high school for a period of two months a reclassification be made if necessary based upon the pupils high school record in two continuous studies e g Latin and algebra 3 That where the difficulties of separation are not too great it be main tained through the second year and in some studies say mathematics through the third thus allowing those whose ability is approximately equal to advance in accordance with their ability 4 Your committee earnestly recommends that so often as may be advis able the teacher meet the slower sections caused by the plan of separation and the slower pupils in all the sections where such separation is not prac ticed and with them go over the work proposed for the regular class work discussing its difficulties suggesting the best methods of overcoming the same so that they may come to a better comprehension of the work they are trying to do After a full consideration of the report in which the discus sion bore not so much upon the details for the carrying out of the plan as upon the plan itself it was ascertained by an informal vote that the present conference was not in favor of the separation into sections upon the basis of scholarship The report of the committee was accepted and ordered placed on file The second committee following the printed order reported as follows PLACE OF GENERAL HISTORY IN SCHOOLS Your committee appointed to consider the following resolution  That it is the sense of this conference that general history socalled should not have a place in our secondary schools but that even when one year only is devoted to history it should be given to some important division of the subject would respectfully report that after a careful consideration of the questions involved they would answer both propositions in the resolution in the nega tive viz that general history socalled should have a place in our sec ondary schools but should extend over at least two years and that when only one year is devoted to history it should not be given to some important division of the subject The committee would heartily disapprove of any course of study which permits only one year of history work and would not be understood in any thing that follows to sanction directly or indirectly such a course The committee believes that the importance and value of the study of history cannot be overestimated and would most cordially indorse the report of the Committee of Sevenwhich recommends a fouryear course in history as follows FirstyearAncient history to 800 A D SecondyearMediaeval and modern European history 2CONFERENCE OF ACADEMIES AND HIGH SCHOOLS Third year English history Fourth yearAmerican history and civics One member of the committee prefers a three years course and the rest concur where a full four years course is not practicable The three years course is the one recommended by the Committee of Seven as follows Second year of high schoolAncient history to 800 A D Third yearEnglish history with special reference to the chief events in the history of continental Europe Fourth yearAmerican history and civics The committee is agreed that it is desirable to introduce into the course in history the elements of the study of sociology and would recommend that steps be taken by this conference looking toward this end In regard to the second part of the resolution which contains the ques tion most liable to be controverted the committee is very clear in the opinion that general history should be taught in preference to the history of any isolated period where there is time for only one but there is some difference of opinion as to its place in the course one or two members of the committee believing it should come at least as late as the third year while another would have it come earlier in order to reach the largest possible number of students The reasons which have led the committee to this decision are very briefly as follows I There are many great facts and persons in general history with which every wellinformed person must be familiar in order that he may understand the numerous allusions which he will come across in the course of his read ing and in his daily life Without this general information he will be wholly at a loss to understand the life conditions by which he is surrounded both in their causes and their tendencies This information cannot be obtained in any other way than by a general survey of the worlds history and in general it will not be secured at all unless such a course is provided in the schools It is far more important that the student should be measurably familiar with the great sweep of history and the movements which have laid the foundations of civilizations and promoted its progress than that he should have studied with more care the comparatively unimportant and limited life of faraway Greece and Rome Even if he secures a better dis cipline which is not certain and acquires a taste for going to original sources the value of which is at least questionable it certainly cannot compensate for his entire ignorance of the great realm of history outside of this area The simple statement of this condition seems to the committee to be conclusive 2 The second reason is not utilitarian but is based upon the nature of historic materials and the method of presentation which they seem to demand inherently It is not possible to present this argument satisfactorily within the limits of a report of this kind but roughly and categorically it may be stated as follows 3THE SCHOOL REVIEW History is an organic unit and not an assemblage or succession of iso lated or incoherent units It must be remembered that history is not mainly or primarily a record of facts but that it is the story of human life as it has gradually developed in individual character and human institutions In each generation is summed up the results of all the vital processes of human life from the very beginning nor can its social and civic conditions be satisfactorily studied except in the light of bygone centuries Thus the study of history rightly becomes the study of human life and society as the increasing product of evolutionary forces acting under laws which are fixed and thus have been operative from the beginning of all things If this is true then history is a science and must be taught by methods which will submit themselves to scientific tests From this standpoint it may easily be shown that the study of history by isolated periods is unsci entific and totally inadequate It violates the generally accepted canons of scientific research and is certainly out of harmony with what has come to be almost a pedagogical axiom that any subject should be presented as a wholein its entiretybefore any part of it becomes the object of special research or intensive study Upon these considerations the conclusions of this committee have been based Respectfully submitted C W FRENCH B F BUCK A A REED A W SMALL Committee THE QUESTION OF SCHOOL AND COLLEGE ATHLETICS Your committee appointed a year ago to consider the questions proposed by Principal C W French wishes hereby to report as follows I The relation of athletics to the school or institution I Athletics can no longer be conducted as a recreation without super vision The instinct of contest for supremacy has created such competition that without supervision pupils will develop unfair tactics and go beyond the bounds of safety 2 Athletics are certainly for all but not all kinds of athletics are for every pupil any more than all studies taught are for every pupil or all kinds of food for every stomach 3 While doubtless some football enthusiasts rank college standing by punts and goals it would be as unfair to charge institutions of learning with such views as to claim that they give credit toward graduation for hazing II In relation to control I Athletics should not and cannot be prohibited Childrens play can not be prohibited neither can courtship These are instincts of humanity 4CONFERENCE OF ACADE MIES AND HIGH SCHOOLS Football is a form of athletics that is of most interest to healthy vigorous young men because it calls for the greatest amount of generalship strategy concerted action selfcontrol and physical vigor 2 Athletics should be encouraged under proper control because it calls forth the exercise of the manly faculties enumerated 3 Athletics should not be allowed to dominate school and college life We may differ as to what constitutes dominating Though the main business of the institution goes on as serenely in the class room as the most scholarly might desire if a crowd of enthusiastic students from the same class room cheer at a football game the inference is immediately drawn that football dominates the institution Both work and play have their function and one cannot take the place of the other III The extent of control I Credit should be given for all systematic work done under faculty supervision Credit for athletics be it ever so small will give it the dignity of work to be well done and will remove the objection raised to faculty control 2 As athletics are for recreation and physical development they should be subservient to intellectual development To this end no one should be permitted to represent an institution in athletics who is not carrying his school work He may still have athletics but not that part in which he represents his school Such honors must be reserved for those who do the work in the class room 3 Since young people are apt to be carried beyond proper bounds by their enthusiasm all such contests should be directed and controlled by a conservative body In the high school the faculty should be that controlling body 4 If a passing average is not maintained in every study the whole case will go by the board High marks with one teacher should not effect low marks with another Such an arrangement will only promote sharp practice and defeat the object of proper relations No matter how severe the physi cal training may be no one should be permitted to represent a school in athletics who is not carrying fifteen hours of regular school work per week To let this down to a general average of 75 per cent is to offer a temptation to professionalism IV Safeguards that should be provided i A physicians certificate The recent examination of the physical con dition of the young men who aspired to play football in our Chicago high schools showed that I2 per cent of them should not be permitted to play at the risk of their lives by reason of heart failure due to organic defects This first attempt at such a regulation shows the wisdom of the rule The parents consent places the responsibility where it belongs Enclosed grounds prevent the spectators from interfering with the game and give both sides fair play It is unreasonable to expect that a fair contest can be held under other conditions 5THE SCHOOL REVIEW 2 No radical change seems possible under the rules of the game at present whereby the dangers of accident may be entirely eliminated To make it as safe as marbles would be desirable if it did not at the same time rob the game of all interest It does not follow however that the great interest in football is the danger to life and limb Life is full of dangers from the cradle to the grave and yet no one would claim that it is on account of these dangers that life is desirable The association game has been pro posed as a substitute for our American game but this can no more be done than a pink tea can take the place of ham and eggs in the case of the day laborer The association game is a kind of free for all goasyouplease game that calls for very little training or skill the other calls for the highest type of athletic specialization 3 There is no more danger from moral deterioration on account of foot ball than from secret societies or dancing parties Competent officials should be provided who will rule a player off the field for swearing or using objec  tionable language or losing his temper 4 Championships and banners are desirable if fairness and honesty pre vail They are the emblems of victory and are essential to the spirit of contest 5 Supression of the athletic tendencies of pupils will not raise the ideals of scholarship Men once denied themselves food and sleep as a means of promoting moral growth Fortunately they have passed on to a world where food sleep and exercise are not needed so far as we are aware We need to prepare men to live in the body and so the physical must be cared for We should teach the young however that mental victories are greater than physical and moral victories greater than either but not that intellectual and moral victories are to be gained by suppressing our physical being 6 The time has indeed come when schools and colleges should recognize the need of fully directing the athletic interests of these institutions For this reason the high schools of the state recently formed an association and adopted rules governing the eligibility of players and provided means for deciding protests A copy of the rules is hereby submitted as a part of this report SECTION I No person shall be qualified to represent any school under this agree ment in any athletic contest with members of another school or schools belonging to this association unless he shall have been enrolled as a member of that school from the beginning of the third week of the semester in which the contest or events take place By the beginning of the semester is meant the first week of school in September and February of each year SEC 2 No person who has represented any school in an interschool contest in any capacity during a semester and whose school connection has lapsed shall be again eligible to represent such school in any athletic capacity until he shall have successfully carried the work of the semester lapsed expulsion suspension for one week or more or absence for more than two weeks for any reason other than disabling sickness shall be deemed lapse of school connection under this rule 6CONFERENCE OF ACADEMIES AND HIGH SCHOOLS SEC 3 No person shall be allowed to represent his school in athletics in any capacity whatever unless he shall be doing passing work in at least fifteen regular periods weekly of recitation work said work to be determined from the teachers reports according to the regular method of the school SEC 4 Any person taking part in athletics and failing to pass in ten hours work during that semester shall be declared ineligible to play another semester until that amount of

representative of a school under this agreement shall be required before every contest SEC 9 No person shall participate in any interschool contest who has ever used or is using his knowledge of athletics or athletic skillfor gain SEC IO No person shall be allowed to represent any school in a contest in foot ball who has not within a period of twelve weeks preceding such contest furnished his principal with a physicians certificate stating that he has personally examined the applicant as to his physical condition and that in his judgment the applicant is in sound health and able to take severe exercise without undue risk SEC I I No person shall play on any school team or contest in any athletic event for more than four years SEC 12 The Board of Control shall furnish blank certificates to all schools belonging to this association SEC 13 The principals of the schools contesting shall exchange certified lists of eligible contestants at least one week before each contest between schools They shall furnish the managers of any organization holding a contest or meet under the rules of this association a certified list of eligible contestants one week before such contest or meet SEC 14 It shall be the duty of the secretarytreasurer to furnish all schools from time to time with an official list of the schools belonging to this association SEC 15 The officers shall prepare a form of agreement to be signed by the principal of each school at the time application is made for membership in this association These agreements shall be kept on file by the secretary SEC 16 No person shall contest or take part in any athletic contest under an assumed name RECOMMENDATIONS I It is recommended that a member of the faculty accompany each team on its trips 2 It is recommended that the parents or guardians consent in writing should be required before any person shall be eligible to play football on any school team 3 It is recommended that the Board of Managers secure competent officials who are not graduates or former pupils of either of the schools engaged in the contest 4 It is recommended that all universities conducting athletic contests between high schools require all contestants to compete under the rules of this association 5 It is recommended that the Amateur Athletic Union adopt the rules of this association governing the eligibility of contestants from all high schools of the state 7THE SCHOOL REVIEW Your committee would therefore respectfully offer the following resolu tions WHEREAS many abuses of amateur athletics have developed in our schools and universities for lack of proper regulations by conservative con trolling bodies and whereas such control has been undertaken among high schools by highschool athletic associations and among universities by a conference of representatives therefore be it Resolved That it is the sense of this conference that we discourage all athletic contests between schools or colleges not under local or state boards of control Resolved That we respectfully request all universities and colleges to hold no athletic meets or contests for high schools except under the rules of state or local boards of control regularly organized and be it further Resolved That we hereby endorse the action of Superintendent E G Cooley in requiring all contestants in football to furnish a physicians certifi cate and the parents consent and to maintain a passing average in all studies provided this shall mean not less than fifteen hours a week in order to be permitted to play on a regular team and be it finally Resolved That we cordially recommend this last resolution to superin tendents of schools and boards of education Respectfully submitted J E ARMSTRONG SPENCER R SMITH A V GREENMAN A new topic The Relative Merits of the Semester and Quar ter Systems in Secondary Schools was next considered The following brief was presented by Superintendent J Stanley Brown of the Joliet Township High School THE QUARTER SYSTEM IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS By the quarter system in secondary schools I understand that in which provision is made for all subjects mentioned in the curriculum to begin three times a year and for the reception of incoming students three times a year I shall proceed on this basis I have no knowledge of any secondary school whose plan of work includes the quarter system and whose curriculum contemplates the addition of students at regular intervals three times a year So what I say will not be based entirely on experience and observation but rather on deductions made from the annual and semester systems of promotion The annual system which provides for the admission of pupils once a year represents one extreme in promotion the district school 8CONFERENCE OF ACADEMIES AND HIGH SCHOOLS in which promotion or demotion may take place at the close of any week represents the other The former exalts the class instruction and debases the individual instruction the latter exalts the individual instruction and debases the class instruction The golden mean is often thought to be in the semester system but with the redistribution of pupils and the consequent forming of slow and fast divisions in various subjects for pupils who entered at the same time the semester system differs very little from the quarter system if indeed it differs at all It seems to me the fundamental reason for making a way to admit pupils two or three times a year is that almost without exception such a scheme benefits the average pupil and those below the average Neither the annual system nor the quarter system affects the strong student He can stand in spite of the curriculum but the weaker stu dent who finds at the close of the first term that he is unable for reasons purely intellectual to go on with his class hails with joy the opportunity to enter a new class where he may review the work and yet have a chance to recover himself and graduate with his class If this new class which the quarter system provides is not awaiting him he drags along at a dying rate till the semester closes and then dis gusted with himself and the school goes out The average pupil who finds his work pretty hard easily persuades himself that he can make an unusual effort because the period over which the extra nerve tension is to extend is short whereas if he must look forward to a years work or even a semesters work he is inclined to think that he cannot pass and hence will not make a trial The quarter system necessitates a larger number of teachers than either the semester or the annual system This condition has its advantage in the fact that instructors may then be chosen to do cer tain specific lines of work covering not more than two subjects related to each other Teachers chosen in such a manner do much more satis factory work and hence in this respect the quarter system may be pro nounced all right The state law requires ten weeks work in physiology to be given in the first year of the high school The quarter system makes it easy to keep this unpopular law without any interference with other work of the school There is quite a large number of educators who look upon second ary work in extension rather than intension They reverse the pro verb so that it reads not much but many things These men would 9THE SCHOOL REVIEW have not a few subjects pursued for one two three or four years in the secondary school but many subjects pursued for a quarter and at most a quarter and a half They would have the young people so it is said obtain a broad foundation for their educational structure This end is accomplished beyond question but in the effort to become broad the foundation had become so thin it would scarcely cast a shadow Now the quarter system furnishes an admirable means of furnishing a broad foundation for three or four new subjects may be begun and finished each quarter Now that many schools have courses wholly or in part elective the quarter system may be looked upon with favor because so many young people know much better what they want or rather what they dont want after the study has been pursued three months The quarter system enables them to begin again and thus recover them selves before it is too late Students are found in all secondary schools who are dependent upon their own resources and while this number is small the quality of work done by them ranks high and the personal worth of the indi vidual is far above the average of the school Now the quarter sys tem is for this somewhat small class of students a great inducement to enter school and complete a course The fact that this system per mits them to work whatever portion of the year employment seems easiest to secure and then to enter classes beginning a subject or at least taking it up at a point wellknown to the entering student is a consideration weighty enough in itself to draw into school many who could not attend under other conditions and to hold in school some who under less favorable conditions would drop out of school The quarter system in secondary schools favors the young men and women who enter professional schools conditioned in some study or studies because they may attend the professional school the six months required and then enter the lower school at the beginning of the next quarter and have their conditions removed by the next year of their professional training The quarter system seems to favor students who have poor health because instead of going to the close of the third month and being compelled to loose the credit for the work done for failing to com plete the required amount he does get credit under the quarter system and is at liberty to remain out for recuperation the following quarter The quarter system is its own defense in the case of students intending to enter colleges or universities in which the quarter system IOCONFERENCE OF ACADEMIES AND HIGH SCHOOLS is in force because the student is not compelled to wait until Septem ber or October before entering but may begin his work at once So it would seem that there is economy of time and energy in the quarter system To summarize this discussion we give the following in favor of the quarter system i It gives an opportunity for the student to recover himself before he has gone so far as to make recovery impossible 2 The period is so brief that even a lazy student persuades himself he can endure whereas if the period were two or three times as long he would not make a trial 3 It gives better opportunity to assign work to teachers according to special fitness 4 It makes it easy to keep the state law concerning physiology 5 It finds a way to satisfy all who wish a broad foundation laid in secondary schools 6 It gives valuable assistance in working out the elective system of studies 7 It is an aid to students working their way through school 8 It favors those entering professional schools on condi tion 9 It works to the advantage of those who drop out of school because of illhealth io It is its own defense in case of students entering universities having the quarter system Dean Miller of the Board of Affliations of the University then presented the following facts relative to the granting of advanced standing in the University of Chicago for work done by students in secondary schools I General principles governing advanced standing I The university recognizes a that it is possible for a student in a first class secondary school to accomplish more in his four years of study in such a school than the fifteen units required for admission to the university b that it is proper that such extra work should be credited toward a college degree where it is comparable in amount and quality with similar work required in the college Such credit is in this paper termed advanced stand ing of the first class 2 The university further recognizes that certain departments in certain schools are so excellently equipped that the privilege may safely be extended to these departments of giving instruction to postgraduate students in sub jects which are not common to the secondary school and the college but which are found only in the junior college required curriculum and of recognizing for credit such instruction after proper examination Such credit is here termed advanced standing of the second class 3 It is held that no student has any claim for advanced standing so long as there is any condition either quantitative or qualitative outstanding against him I ITHE SCHOOL REVIEW II The practical administration of these princip5les I Advanced standing of the first class a Owing to the assumed dif ference in age between the secondary and college student and the conse quent greater immaturity of the former at the time when the subject in question was pursued credit for advanced standing is given at the ratio of 2 to 3 that is for one unit of work in the secondary school two majors of credit in college are allowed b The subjects which are common to school and college curricula are history mediaeval and modern French and German c In case of students from affiliated schools whose examinations in course are set read and graded by the university itself advanced stand ing for excess credit in these subjects is assigned upon the students entrance without further examination d Students from co6perating schools whose work has not been so examined are given a statement of claim for advanced standing upon their admission to the university which claim they are required to present to the departmental examiner and make good this claim by such examination as he may require 2 Advanced standing of the second class The university recognizes for credit distinctive college work in the secondary school under the follow ing conditions a That this shall be of the nature of postgraduate work the student having previously completed all units required for admission b That the departmental examiner shall have approved the work as offered c That the student shall pass the university examination upon the course in question The subjects hitherto offered under these conditions are third year Greek Homer junior college Latin junior college mathematics and the required course in rhetoric styled in the junior college English I III Some results of this system Of the students who entered the university from the secondary schools October i I900 fiftythree had claim for advanced standing in the different subjects of both classes mentioned above Of these eighteen received credit upon their claim after examination It would appear that in most cases the claims were not presented to the departmental examiners but were allowed to go by default On October i I901 thirteen students from affiliated schools received without further examination credit aggregating forty majors This was given largely in French and German with some additional credits in college Latin mathematics and English On the same date the claims for advanced stand ing of over forty students from cooperating schools were recognized largely in German French and trigonometry The returns upon the claims have not yet been received The president appointed the following committee on program for the next conference Superintendent A V Greenman W Aurora chairman President Ellen Sabin Milwaukee

class for boys was Sherwood Fender of the Kansas City Central High School THE GENERAL CONFERENCE The general conference on Saturday morning considered the topic  Current Problems in Secondary Education The lead ing paper in the discussion was presented by Professor John Dewey of the University His paper with syllabus follows CURRENT PROBLEMS IN SECONDARY EDUCATION I should feel hesitant indeed to come before a body of teachers engaged in the practical work of teaching and appear to instruct them regarding the solution of the difficult problems which face them My task is a more grateful one It is mine simply to formulate and arrange the difficulties which the current state of discussion shows teachers already to have felt Those concerned with secondaryschool work have realized that their energies must be peculiarly concentrated at certain points they have found that some problems are so urgent that they must be met and wrestled with I have tried in the accom panying syllabus to gather together these practical problems and to arrange them in such form as to show their connections with one another and by this classification to indicate what seem to me the roots of the difficulty 13

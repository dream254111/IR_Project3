vicepresidential addresses delivered in sections C D or G In our next num ber we shall print in full the promised papers of Messrs Carhart and Dana At some future time we may also take occasion to refer more particularly to the report of the committee upon the removal of duties on imported textbooks and the discussion of the same of which we have a full account Few other committees besides this and those already announced mnade any reports and the several com mittees on weights measures and coinage on stand ard time on primary meridian and international standard time and on the records of science were discontinued that on standard time in consequence of the favorable action of the railways of the country in the proper direction The committee on the intro duction of science teaching in the public schools on the registration of deaths births and marriages on stellar charts and on an international convention of scientific associations reported progress and were continued A bylaw to the constitution was passed providing that every member should have the privilege of regis tering the members of his family at meetings of the association not including men over twentyone years of age by paying three dollars for each registration the person so registered being entitled to all privileges offered members by the local committee The stand ing committee also passed a rule that hereafter no paper will be accepted for reading before any of the sections unless accompanied by such abstract as the writer deems ready for publication Sections H and I had in some respects a similar experience at Minneapolis Both were unable to organize until the week of the meeting was half over To each there came almost at the very last moment a paper of unusual interest In the anthropological section Miss Babbitts paper announced the dis covery in Minnesota of traces of human labor be neath a deposit of twelve or fifteen feet of the material which forms one of the terraces of an ancient river This seems to be a confirmation of the theory ad vanced by Dr Abbott respecting his similar dis coveries in New Jersey that man existed on this continent during at least a portion of the glacial epoch There will of course be a lively discussion between experts as to whether these qulartz speci mens are actual relics of human industry Thus far at best the glacial workmian is known only by his chips In the section devoted to statistics Mr Dodge an nounced wliat may perhaps be accounted a discovery in that dry branch of science lie has found that a singular and quite definite relation exists in large communities between an excess of nonagricultural over agricultural workers and an increase of values in the land products and wages of agriculture The figures may soothe the fears of those political econo mists who from time to time predict national disaster NCE VOL II No 22 because so few American youths take kindly to farm ing pursuits An obvious inference from the statis tistics is that prosperity comes where industry is diversified Weapons of argument may thence be drawn by those who believe in a public policy tend ing to encourage nonagricultural industries  The Royal academy of medicine of Turin has unanimously awarded the Riberi prize of 20000 francs 4000 to Prof Bizzozero for his researches on the Physiopathology of blood the subject proposed by the academy The commissioners of award received several essays those of Wharton Jones Norris Hayem and Bizzozero were consid ered to deserve special consideration The last two were assigned the first rank The most important matter in both of these is the investigation of the third morphological element of the blood Hayems haematoblasts The commissioners all wellknown savants judged that Hayem did not completely dem onstrate that the red globules are derived from the haematoblasts Bizzozero solves the important prob lem of the origin of the red globules determines the relation of the haematoblasts to coagulation and throws new light on the formation of thrombi His memoir was therefore deemed the more impor tant and to Bizzozero accordingly the very valuable award has been made  The officers of the Cincinnati society of natural history inaugurated about June 1 a course of free lectures on botany The first was given on June 9 to a company of fortyseven many of them teachers in the public schools The lectures have been con tinued weekly and the last was given on Aug 11 The object of the society in the establishment of this course was to get the public generally interested in scientific pursuits and the success of this the first attempt of the kind in this city for many years has been most gratifying The average attendance has been over thirty notwithstanding the hot weather lateness of the season and the absence from the city of many who would otherwise have attended The officers hope in the autumn to have courses in other branches of science so that a general interest may be awakened among the citizens and atttetion called to the importance of the study  News has been received from the French meteor ological station at Orange Harbor Patagonia all were in good health and work progressing favorably The cattle which had been brought from Montevideo had perished but those from Punta Arenas were flourishing The surgeon of the party Dr Hyades had made full anthropological investigations of the Fuegians who were settled near the station Casts of heads and limbs had been secured and many photographs taken A collection of utensils etc had been brought together including a large canoe with its entire outfit He was engaged in studying the language which appeared to be somewhat dit ferent from the vocabularies collected by Darwin nearly half a century ago Professor W A Rogers wishes us to state that the relation between the imperial yard and the metre des archives is wrongly given in our abstract of hisSEPTEMBER 14 1883 SCIE paper on p 250 It should have been stated as fol lows Imperial yard  337027 inches  metre des archives Matthew Arnolds ingenious argument for the survival of literature from its relation to conduct encounters an objection in the apparent effect of sci entific pursuits upon the character of his country men When one affirmed of Clerk Maxwell that he was free from every taint of the world the flesh and the devil it seemed no exaggeration to those who knew him Darwin Balfour Sir Rowan Hamil ton and H J S Smith each in his turn was scarce ly less endeared by his genial virtues than admired for his lofty powers None of these was so largely identified with the world its business temptations its social allurements as William Spottiswoode the late president of the Royal Society and none left the memory of a purer life a heart more full of exer cised humanity In his funeral sermon referring to the text  The world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of the Lord abideth forever the Dean of Westminster Abbey said Apart from gen eral considerations of life and death the words have special reference to that last one of our own time ac counted worthy to rest with the illustrious dead within these walls  To his great talents and his pro found knowledge were united such graces of charac ter as the most modest unselfishness and the most spotless integrity He was ever anxious earnestly and justly to place before his fellowmen such knowl edge as would conduce to their welfare and so well did he do this work among his countrymen that it might be doubted whether his philanthropy did not predominate over his love of science M Pasteur has proved that the burial of diseased animals does not destroy the germs of disease or obviate the chalnce of infection to any animals who may afterwards feed on the ground above where the body of the diseased animal was buried M Aime Girard proposes to destroy the germns in the dead bodies of diseased animals by treating the carcasses with cold concentrated sulphuric acid The destruc tion of the germs is proved to be complete Experi ments made at St Gobain show that three hundred and twentyone kilograms at 60 proof dissolved in ten days nine sheep weighing two hundred and four kilograms The resulting liquid mixed with four hundred and forty kilograms of coprolites from Ar dennes produced nine hundred and forty kilograms of superphosphate of lime containing thirtysix per cent of nitrogen Thus by a simple process most dangerous bodies are destroyed and a valuable fer tilizer obtained Nature announces that the Lords of the com mittee of council on education of England have by a recent minute decided to withdraw the prizes hitherto given to candidates in the science examina tions who obtain a first class in the elementary stage of the various subjects of science substituting cer tificates of merit and retaining only the prizes given in the advanced stage The money hitherto devoted to prizes will be employed in providing thirtysix NCE 385 national scholarships twelve each year  which will be offered in competition to students of the in dustrial classes and awarded at the annual examina tions of the department The National scholarship will be tenable at the option of the holder either at the Normal school of science South Kensington or at the Royal college of science Dublin during the course for the associateship  about three years The scholar will receive thirty shillings a week during the session of nearly nine months in the year second class railway fare to and from London or Dublin and free admission to the lectures and laboratories This is a most important step in advance  The Rev Father Emile Fortune Stanislas Joseph Petitot well known for his valuable contributions to American linguistics and his extended journeys over the Hudson Bay territory has received a medal from the Royal geographical society He is the first French man thus honored since Francis Garnier He has now retired from missionwork and will devote him self to study for some years  The DelalandGuerineau prize has for the second time been bestowed by the French academy upon M Savorgnan de Brazza of Congo notoriety The military medal for exceptional services has been given to the sergeant Malamine a native of Senegal for his defence of Brazzaville against all comers dur ing the absence of his superior The last number of the bulletin of Nuttal club contains part of Burrows list of birds from the lower Uruguay which is sufficiently full to be of value The critical list of birds in vicinity of Col orado Springs is of great interest Mr Allens val uable list of minor ornithological publications should also be mentioned Mr E H Miller states in the American agricul turist that wherever the ornamental shrub commonly called Deutzia scabra grows near grapevines the rosebugs prefer the flowers of the Deutzia and thus the grapes are protected Grapegrowers may there fore cultivate a charming shrub with a double pur pose Rev W W Meech recommends in the American agriculturist judicious salting to prevent the blight which troubles quinces and burning affected parts to overcome the ravages of the fungus Roestelia au rantiaca The sixth annual report on the birds of Ger many in the Journal fiir ornithologie contains many interesting notes on migrations and breedingdates At a lecture recently given at Mauch Chunk Penn by Mr Charles A Ashburner geologist in charge of the anthracite surveys in that state the lecturer made some general statements in regard to the amount of coal which has been mined and which still remains in the region which we copy from the Mining herald of Shenandoah  The total amount of coal produced from the anthracite fields up to Jan 1 1883 was 509333695 tons It is hard to realize this amount To place it in a popular form it was stated that it would form a solid compact wall of coal 25 cubic feet  2240 pounds  1 ton 100 feet wide and 100 feet high for a distance of 241 miles or it386 SCIE would form a similar wall along the railroad between Philadelphia and New York 100 feet wide and 268 feet high It was estimated that the region originally contained 25000000000 tonls If it be assumed that in the production of 509333695 tons an area has been practically exhausted which originally contained 1500000000 tons there is 94O of the coal origi nally contained which still remains untouched In comparing the anthracite region with the bitumi nous fields of England the estimated contents of the former is about onesixth of what the most recent estimates assign to the latter About the same pro portion exists between the annual production of Pennsylvania anthracite and English bituminous Mr A shburner stated the estimates were based upon very general but at present the most reliable data The geologicalsurvey estimates have not yet ex tended beyond the Panther Creek basin between Mauch Chunk and Tarnaqua It was stated that this basin originally contained 1032000000 tons of coal double the amount which has already been shipped from the entire region An area had been mined over in this basin up to last January which originally contained about 92000000 tons so that 91 of the original coal still remains untouched About 88 y of the coal which has been mined from this basin was taken from the mammoth bed In a subsequent communication to the same paper Mr Ashburner disclaims having made any statements with regard to the exhaustion of the anthracite coal fields of Pennsylvania with which he had been credited by various newspapers He adds however that Mr P W Sheafer who has probably given this subject more careful consideration than any one else has made a very general statement that the field still contains about 25000000000 tons of coal Up to Jan 1 1883 he had estimated that the total produc tion amounted to 509333695 tons It has been gener ally thought that but onethird of the coal contained has been consumed as fuel so that up to last January an area had been exhausted which originally contained about 1500000000 tons 23500000000 tons remain ilg untouched If this same proportion of produc tion to original content be applied to that which still remains about 8000000000 tons would represent the possible future production According to the mine inspectors report there was produced last year 31281066 tons If this production should remain constant for all future time the field would be ex hausted in a little over 250 years Such a conclusion is quite untenable for our yearly production is rap idly increasing In 1870 there was shipped from the region 16182191 tons and in 1880 23437242 tons The abrupt exhaustion of the coalfields is a practical impossibility nor is it reasonable to suppose that if on an average for every ton of coal won there are two lost this will be the practice in future mining The geological survey has already in its possession many valuable facts to throw light on this subject but as it is hoped that the survey will be completed before this question of ultimate exhaustion will be come one of practical concern it would be folly to make any statement as to how long the coal will last NCE VOL II No 32  M Daubree has been examining an interesting meteorite which fell not far from Nogoga in the province of Entre Rios Argentine Republic Chemi cal analysis proves that the meteorite contains iron lime and magnesia but its most important feature is that it is said to contain carbon in an organic form which is chiefly proved by the action of potash in it M Daubree from this is led to hope that he may yet find organic remains in a meteorite In the September Atlantic Bradford Torrey prints some studies in the temperaments of birds which will interest ornithologists as they are made from personal observation The chickadee goldfinch brown thrush towhee bluejay shrike whiteeyed vireo and chat and the NewEngland species of Hylocichlae are discussed The Florence newspapers announce the acqui sition of a skull of Mastodon arvernensis by the Isti tuto di studii superiori Professor dAncona writes to La nazione that it was found through excavations that were making in pliocene deposits in the neighbor hood of Percussina situated about two hundred metres above the sea between Siena and Florence  In his recent work on cultivated plants DeCan dolle says  In the history of cultivated plants I have found no indication of communications between the inhabitants of the old and new world anterior to the discovery of America by Columbus The Gulf Stream has equally been without effect Between America and Asia two transportations may have been effected one by man the batatas the other by man or by the sea cocoanut Drs Gray and Trumbull in com menting on this in the last number of the Amlerican journal of science say  Perhaps the banana should be ranked with the sweetpotato in this regard And we may merely conjecture that the purslain came to our eastern coast with the Scandinavians or the Basques Ostrichchicks are hatching out at the ostrich farm near Anaheim Cal at the rate of one a day When they first come out of the egg they are about the size of a halfgrown duck They have good ap petites and grow rapidly Means of transportation are rapidly increasing on the borders of countries not within the recognized bounds of civilization Thus it is announced that the journey from Paris to Algiers will shortly be re duced to thirtythree hours rail and steamer travel of which only sixteen will be by boat Hitherto passengers by the Marseilles line in the regular rou tine of travel have spent forty hours on the water alone beside the railway journey from Paris At the meeting of the French entomological society held July 11 Mr E Lefevre showed a large solitary ant allied to Ponera found about Hong Kong remrarkable for the extraordinary development of its mouth parts and for its power of leaping being able when disturbed to make bounds of twenty to twenty five centimetres The statement was confirmed by the experience of earlier observers As the legs are in no way developed for springing Mr Lefevre was inclined to think that it was accomplished in some way by its buccal organs

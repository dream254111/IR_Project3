j101009,The Virginia Law Register,1101809,Section 3211 Remedy by Motion Generally Proceedings Therein,i245951,CORRESPONDENCE CORRESPONDENCE Acts to Simplify Our Pleading and Practice Editor of Virginia Law Register In response to the sentiment of a large proportion of the profession there were introduced at the last session of the legislature several bills looking to a reformation and simplification of our system of pleading and practice Some of these bills contained much merit but to the committees to which they were referred the changes proposed by them appeared to be too sweeping and radical for commendation This has been the fate of all efforts to bring about a general codifica tion of our procedure and convinces that such codification though certain ultimately will be accomplished gradually partial reforms being adopted as the necessity for them becomes manifest In view of the many unsettled points involved in the proceeding by motion under Section 3211 of the Code which appear to make leg islation advisable for the perfection of that remedy it seems that an easy and perhaps the best way to accomplish a considerable and yet not too general or radical reform in our procedure would be by way of amendment of that section in such manner as to enlarge the scope of the remedy by motion and at the same time make the procedure thereunder simple and certain Accordingly the following suggested amendment of Section 3211 has been prepared for submission to the members of the bar through the Register merely as a suggestion for their consideration It is believed that the remedy by motion with its procedure defined and simplified into certainty will be even more popular with the pro fession than it is now Very truly yours JAMES M QUICKE Jr Section

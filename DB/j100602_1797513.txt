Hamilton Esq F RS Real January 9 1837 TIE situation of Taviums the larincial town of the Troomi or Eastern Galatians has been considered a point of great importance by those who have taken an interest in the geography of Asia Minor and wllo irl ignoIance of any ancient ruins iII tlle art of the country where the ancient Itineraries tenl to place TaviumOn Tamum 75 have conjecturally assigned three lifferent modern llaces as its site viz Chorfim YuzkEt and Tekiyeh Tt is probable how erer that none of these places represent the ancient capital of the Troomi but a nllage namel Boghazkoi situated between Choriim anl Yuzkat about twentyfive miles listant from the former and within twenty miles of the latter Here M Texier two years ato discovered extensive remains of antiquity though for reasons which I mnnot unlerstanl he has attriluteal them not to Tanum but to Themiseyra Neither Cllorum nor Yuzkat have tlle appearance of hxaing been ancient sites The former town which has not been deseribel by an molern tra reller is situatetl in the mixldle of an extensise elongatel plain surrounlel by larren hills at the distance of about tlvo miles from the tolvn tv the east anzl lvest Its lengthismuchmoreconsielerahle A smlll stream runs through it from north to south which aftersards flolvs to the castward and ultimately falls into the Chotilek IrmAk a large river which joins the Iris or TokatSu about eight miles above Amasia It lies consequently on the eastern sieRe of the range of hills which forms the watershed between the Halys and the Iris anl as natural boundaries generally formell the limits of ancierlt coun tries this district was in all Irobability not incluleti within the province of Galatia Accorling to the Turks Choriim is eom paratively speaking a mollern town founleel by Sultan Amu rath by whom a large handsome mosque anl a square ugly for tress were built In the walls of this castle are insertel many Greek inscriptions and shxafts of columns but the former are all sepulchral and apparently of Christian times They are saixl to hase come from a village called Hurhat about thilty miles lvest by south from Amasia anl where there are some few remains of the substructions of a church This is proltable for there is another inscription in the courtyard of the Governor of Chorum of the same character mrhiCh my Tatar then in the service of this Gvvernort seized in the possession df some Armenians who were taking it to hIarsilan anl which hal leen found at the same place The distance of Chorum from Amasia is only about 48 miles Xhereas the Peutinger Table gives 73 Roman miles be tween Amasia anl Tanum Yuzkat is situatel in a narrow valleys confined on the north and soutll ly high barren hills anl offers no natural atlvantages for the situation of a town Wool and fuel are extremely scarce anl it commands no rich or fertile plaitl antl possesses no suffici ently insulated heigllt to answer the purpose of an Acropolis As a town aIso its date is very recent llanng been founlel by Achmet  See Leakes Asia Minor iJne76 On  Taq3ium Pasha the father of the famous Suleiman Bey oiX the Chaptin Oghlu family about eighty years ago Not a fountawin or corner of a house can boast a block of stone which has the least trace or appearance of antiquity It is said indeed to have been a miser able mountain yaila or summer residence of the peasants before Chapan Oglllu fixed upon it as his residence Rennell on the authority of Tollrnefort supposed Tekiyeh to represent Tavium Tournefbrt merely mentions that he halted at a place called Tekiyeh between Tokat andAngora but this probably Tekiyeh being a common Turkish name meaning a saints tomb is not the same place as the village Tekiyeh which is situated between Amasia arld Chorum six miles east by north of the latter where are some fragments of antiquity and where I copied two inscriptions for in this case Tournefort Inust also have passed through Chorum which does not appear to have loeen the case This Tekiyeh moreover is too near to Amasian being not more than 13 hours or 42 miles distant from it Elut there is another Tekiyeh in the Hasan Ova an extensive plain half way between Chorum and Yuzkat producing much corn and in the middle of which is situated the large village of Alajah This place is between eight and nine hours nearly due south from Chorum and in the plain alJout two miles southwest from AlX jah there is a large ruined Tekiyeh or sepulchre and near it a beautiful spring of water very cold and copious Alajah being on or near the great road from Tokat to Angora this probaloly is the Tekiyeh where Tournefort halted The caravans even now seldom halt in the villages but in the neighbourhood near some fountain or where pasture is found for their cattle Here is nothing to indicate the existence of an ancient town The building is of early Saracenic times with a handsome marble doorway on one side very richly ornamented with early Gothic carvings Besides a few small apartments attached to it it consists only of the nave or centre with four large niches or recesses one on each side arched over and the centre appears to have been covered with a dome In the outside wall I found one imperfect Christian Greek inscription much mutilated and in the burialgroundnof Alajah several tombstones evidently Chris tian hanng large crosses carved upon them but without any mscrlptlon The ruins at Boghazkoi have an air of remote antiquity and impress the beholder with a grea idea of the power and wealth  Fuleiman Bey is nvell knonvn for his successful resistance to the orders of the Porte anl for his great wealth alld power He was one of the most influential Dereh Beys itl Asia Millor before the Porte deprived them of their feudal

giles 32 hours wilich calculatel at 31 miles per hour gives 104 miles anl at 3 miles per hour 96 miles An intermediate number in statute miles will be nearly equal to 116 Roman WI P So far therefore the situation of Boghazkii wa11 agree with that of  t  anum 2 Tavium to CcesareaOn this road the Antonine Itinerary gises 109 miles the Table 191 But this number being evidently incorrect the route in the Table is useless unless we supose Aquas Aruenas to be the same place as Therma in which case we shall 11ave 1 13 miles by this route in the Table Now the Turlis reckon 30 hours Iom Yuzkat to

and Tanum as con tainel in the Peutinger Table the only authority onthis route lvhereas tlle distancc from I3oghiskii to Amasia is about 27 hours or 88 miles passing by Alajah But there is probably some crrr in the Table here for if we move Tanum to a position wllich is nearer than Boghaskoi to Amasia the listance5 in the Itinertlry whicl are generally more correct than in the Table viill no longer agree with those from BoghAzkii to Angora and Kaisa riyweh respectixely The rviins at Boghazk6i have already been descriled bv M Tesier in some letters partly pululishel in the French papers Tllough few they are striking and interesting The princiyal ruin and which tllrows every thing else into the shazle not ex ceptint even tlle basrelief cut on the rocks consists of the perfect remains of thc groundplan of a temylf f large yroportilns Witll the exception of one corner the hole internal structure anl arrangement of the cella pronaos adytuln passages and small apartments on two siles may be distinctly traced The whole is forInel of hute luloks of marble with the excetion of one end of the buikling either the pronaos or adytum as architects shall letermine The whole length of the building not incluling two listinct enclosures wllich surround it is 219 feet by 140 The walls are of solitl bloeks five feet thick the interior of the cella measures 87 feet by 65 The temple stands upon a rising ground facing the northeast on which sle the ground appears to have been artificiMly raisetl to form a level space Both to the northeast and northwest flights of steps appear to have led up to the building anl a ortico appears to have existed on the northvest siele Tllat Taium possessel a celebrated temple of Jupiter we may inferfrom its beillg mentionel by Strabo lib xii Tho speaks of vln vIssluTn anl of a colossal statue of the lcit and rho woull in a11 lrlleability not have allulel to it hal it not been a remarkalle louilzling The large lulocks of stone wllich althougll fitting close are sometimes irrewular in their shape have been fastenel togethr ly larte xnetal pins Most of the blocks have sis antl sometimes more sockets an inch and a half  in liameter anfl bom the moule in lvhich the stones are broken away it seems probable that the temple was destroyed by barbarians for the sake of extracting the metal I lid not discover the slightest trace of shafts or bases or capi tals of columns or architectural sculrture or ornaments of any kinel A ruxle simplicity seems to have persaded all parts of thc buikling The space letween the cella antl tlle outer wall on the southeast side is divided into a number of small chambers theOn Tauum 79 outer wall of each being formed of a smgle stone varying from 15 to 17 feet in length These apartments were yrobably coverel over and on them the columns may have been placel if any SUC1 e2ziste1 On tlle hillsile to the southwest lehinel the telnple I saw many large llocks of storle but they appearel to me ratllr to hase been derivel from the ruins of the temple anl its to inclosures than to have belongezl to other buildings To the westwarl of the temple and on tlle same sloping grounl are the remains of a square enclosure probably a fortress It is surrounded by a raised mounl on the summit of which I tracel ill several places remains of a massie and almost Cyclopean wall To the east of the temple are the remains of another fortress on tl1c summit of a high steep hill commanling the town Tlle sumInit of this hill is surrounlel with a tllick wall or ratlaer heaI of loosc stones sloling loth insile anl outsile at an angle of 40 except on the northeast sile where there is a perpenlicular cliS down tc a deep ravine At the top I found several large holes excavated in the soliel rock apparently for cisterns and the whole surface was covered vith fragments of ancient pottery anl tiles The basrclief cut in tlle roeks is situatefl about a mile or a mile anel a half northeast from the temple It is in a small irregularshaped hollow resemiling an ancient quarry It is open to the southwest the rocks being from 30 to 50 feet hith on each sile but lower at the end opposite the opening It is a curious and interesting monument anel although many of the figures are nearly obliteratel particularly those furthest removel from the centre it is llneloultetlly the most remarkalle Inonu ment hitherto discoerezl in this part of Asia It rere sents tlle meeting of tro kings eacll llolding emllems of roalty in his hand and with a long train o followers who extend along the tlvo sides of tlle hollow space The two princiyal figures are five Qfeet higlln the fexv figures near them are three feet sis inehes anl tilC OtllerS tFo feet sis inches high One of tllc princiyal figures that on the left colninr from tlle west as well as llis folloXers are in light closefitting dresses wearing higll conical caps anxl beards The other lrincipal figure and follovers are lressel in loose flowing robes with a square turreted heal dress These hale no beards The former may possibly re Ilresent the king of Lydia or of Egypt and the latter the liing of Persia or of Media and may not this monilment have beex intend el to commemorate a peace con cluled letweerl theln  Both these kings were at tvar with tlle king of Persia or of the Medes in this part of Asia anal the Halws whichflows about 15 or QO miles to the northwest was at one time the boundary of the possessions of the Lydians and the Medes I am inclinel to80 On Tevium consiler that the figures mthout beards and in loose flowing dresses represent the Medes or Persians rather than Amazons from the circumstance of some of the attendants immediately behinl the rinciIal figure being represented standing upon the wings of a loublehealed eagle a symbol frequently met vith on the ruined Persian buiklins of a later perioel which occur in Armenia and other Iarts of Asia Minor anl the king himself is reprcsenteel stanling on a wilul least

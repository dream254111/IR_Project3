HIGHNESS THE PRINCESS DOWAGER OF WALES AT KEW ON A NEW SPECIES OF ILLICIUM LINNAEI OR STARRY ANISEED TREE LATELY DISCOVERED IN WEST FLORIDA S I R Y O U R EXTENSIVE KNOWLEDGE IN BO TANY AND GREAT SKILL IN THE CULTI VATION OF THE RAREST EXOTIC PLANTS FROM ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD IN THE CELEBRATED BOTANIC GARDEN OF HER ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCESS DOWAGER OF WALES AT KEW WILL I HOPE APOLOGIZE FOR ME TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY FOR THE LIBERTY I TAKE IN LAYING THIS LETTER WHICH I ADDRESS TO YOU BEFORE THEM ESPECIALLY AS MOST OF THAT ILLUSTRIOUS BODY WHO HAVE MADE THAT AGREEABLE SCIENCE THEIR STUDY ARE FULLY CONVINCED OF THE TRUTH OF IT BY OFTEN HAVING THE PLEASURE OF SEEING THAT MOST NOBLE AND TRULY PRINCELY COLLECTION WHICH IS SO HAPPILY PLACED UNDER YOUR CARE READ DEC 13 1770 I CONFESS MYSELF PARTICULARLY OBLIGED BY YOUR SKILL AND ATTENTION IN RAISING NOT ONLY THE OAK ACORNS WHICH WERE PUT INTO YOUR HANDS BY THE ROYAL SOCI ETY AFTER THEY HAD BEEN PRESERVED BY ME A WHOLE SEASON525 SEASON IN WAX BUT ALSO FOR THE CARE YOU HAVE TAKEN IN RAISING ONE OF THE FIRST TEAPLANTS THAT HAS BEEN PRODUCED FROM SEED IN THIS KINGDOM ESPECIALLY AS IT CAME TO ME IN SUCH A SITUATION THAT IT COULD SCARCELY BE EXPECTED TO VEGETATE YOU HAVE FURTHER SHEWED YOUR SKILL IN RAISING MANY OF THE STARRY ANISEED TREES FROM WEST FLORIDA AFTER THEY HAD BEEN CONFINED IN A BOX UNDER THE SHIPS DECKS FOR NEAR FOUR MONTHS A VOYAGE NEAR AS LONG AS FROM ST HELENA OR EVEN THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE I SHALL NOW PROCEED TO GIVE YOU A HISTORY OF THIS CURIOUS TREE BOTH AS A NATIVE OF JAPAN CHINA AND OTHER PARTS OF THE EAST AS WELL AS BOTH THE FLORIDAS IN NORTH AMERICA WE MEET WITH AN ACCOUNT OF THE EASTERN ONE TO GETHER WITH A FIGURE OF IT TAKEN FROM CLUSIUS IN PARKINSONS THEATRE OF PLANTS P 1569 WHERE HE OBSERVES THAT SOME BRANCHES OF IT WITH THE HUSKS AND SEEDS ONLY WITHOUT LEAVES OR BLOSSOMS WERE BROUGHT INTO ENGLAND BY SIR THOMAS CAVENDISH IN QUEEN ELIZABETHS TIME FROM THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS WHERE HE MET WITH IT IN HIS VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD THESE BRANCHES WERE GIVEN TO MR MORGAN THE QUEENS APOTHECARY AND TO MR JAMES GARRAT OF WHOM CLU SIUS RECEIVED THEM MONSIEUR GEOFFROY IN HIS MATERIA MEDICA TRANS LATED IN 1736 BY DR G DOUGLASS P 322 CALLS IT ANISUM SINENSE SEMEN BADIAN  FRUCTUS STELLATUS AND SAYS IT IS HIGHLY ESTEEMED IN CHINA AND ALL OVER THE EAST THAT IT IS USED TO CURE ANY BAD TASTE IN THE MOUTH AS A PRESERVATIVE AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF BAD AIR AND ALSO FOR THE STONE AND GRAVEL THE INDIANS LIKEWISE 5526 LIKEWISE STEEP THIS FRUIT IN WATER AND AFTERWARDS FER MENT THE INFUSION AND THUS MAKE A VINOUS LIQUOR THAT THE DUTCH IN THE EASTINDIES AS WELL AS THE NATIVES MIX THIS FRUIT WITH THEIR TEA AND SHERBET KAEMPFER IN HIS AMAENITATES EXOTICAE P 880 CALLS IT SOMO OR SKIMMI AND HAS GIVEN US A VERY GOOD FIGURE OF A BRANCH OF IT WITH THE LEAVES FLOWERS AND FRUIT HE FOUND IT IN JAPAN AND SAYS THAT THE JAPONESE AND CHINESE ESTEEM IT A SACRED TREE THAT THEY OFFER IT TO THEIR IDOLS AND BURN THE BARK OF IT AS A PERFUME ON THEIR ALTARS AND LAY THE BRANCHES UPON THE GRAVES OF THE DEAD AS AN OFFERING TO THE GHOSTS OF THEIR PIOUS DEPARTED FRIENDS AND THAT THE PUBLIC WATCHMEN USE THE POWDER OF THIS AROMATIC BARK STREWED IN SMALL WINDING GROVES OR LITTLE CHANNELS ON SOME ASHES IN A BOX SECURED FROM THE WEATHER FOR THE FOLLOWING PURPOSE THIS POWDER BEING LIGHTED AT ONE END BURNS SLOWLY ON AND BEING COME TO CER TAIN MARKED DISTANCES THEY STRIKE A BELL AND BY MEANS OF THIS TIMEKEEPER PROCLAIM THE HOURS OF THE NIGHT TO THE PUBLIC AND LASTLY THAT IT HAS THE REMARK ABLE PROPERTY OF RENDRING THE POISON OF THE BLADDER FISH TETRAODON OCELLATUS OF LINN SYST OF NATURE P 333 MORE VIRULENT AS MANY HAVE EXPERIENCED THAT HAVE USED VIOLENT MEANS TO DESTROY THEMSELVES WE ARE INDEBTED FOR THE FIRST DISCOVERY OF THIS CU RIOUS AMERICAN TREE TO A NEGRO SERVANT OF WILLIAM CLIFTON ESQ CHIEF JUSTICE OF WEST FLORIDA WHO WAS SENT TO COLLECT SPECIMENS OF ALL THE RARER PLANTS BY HIS MASTER AT MY REQUEST AND IN APRIL 1765 HE MET WITH THIS CURIOUS TREE GROWING IN A SWAMP NEAR THE TOWN OF PENSACOLA THE SPECIMENS I RECEIVED IN JULY FOLLOWING AFTER527 AFTER THIS IN THE LATTER END OF JANUARY 1766 MR JOHN BARTRAM THE KINGS BOTANIST FOR THE FLO RIDAS DISCOVERED IT ON THE BANKS OF THE RIVER ST JOHN IN EAST FLORIDA AS APPEARS FROM HIS DESCRIPTION OF IT AND THE DRAWING OF A SEEDVESSEL WITH SOME OF THE LEAVES WHICH HE SENT TO OUR LATE WORTHY MEMBER PETER COLLINSON ESQ WHO WAS SO KIND AS TO COM MUNICATE THEM TO ME MR BARTRAMS DESCRIPTION OF IT AS IT APPEARS IN HIS JOURNAL UP THE RIVER ST JOHNS PUBLISHED BY DR STORK IN HIS ACCOUNT OF EAST FLORI DA IS AS FOLLOWS  NEAR HERE MY SON FOUND A LOVELY SWEET TREE  WITH LEAVES LIKE THE SWEET BAY WHICH SMELLED LIKE  SASSAFRAS AND PRODUCES A VERY STRANGE KIND OF SEED  POP BUT ALL THE SEED WAS SHED THE SEVERE FROST  HAD NOT HURT IT SOME OF THEM GREW NEAR TWENTY  FEET HIGH A CHARMING BRIGHT EVERGREENARO  MATIC THIS OBSERVATION OF MR BARTRAM RELATING TO ITS BEARING A SEVERE FROST MAY AFFORD US A USEFUL HINT IN THE CULTIVATION OF THIS TREE ESPECIALLY AS I AM CON VINCED FROM REPEATED ACCOUNTS OF THE WEATHER IN WEST FLORIDA THAT THE FROST IS MUCH MORE INTENSE THERE FROM WHENCE THOSE PLANTS WHICH YOU NOW HAVE IN VIGOUR WERE BROUGHT THAN IN EASTFLORIDA SO THAT THE EXPERIMENT IS WELL WORTH MAKING WITH ONE OF THEM TO SEE HOW FAR IT WILL STAND THE SEVERITY OF OUR WINTERS SHOULD IT SUCCEED IT WOULD BE A VERY GREAT ACQUISITION TO OUR GARDENERS AND BE HIGHLY ORNA MENTAL TO OUR PLANTATIONS OF EVERGREENS THE MEDICINAL PROPERTIES OF THIS TREE ARE CERTAINLY WORTH ENQUIRING INTO THE LEAVES AFFORD A MOST AGREEABLE BITTER A SPRIG OF IT SET TO PUTRISY IN A PHIAL OF528 OF WATER THE BARK SOON BECAME FULL OF A CLEAR MUCI LAGE THE YOUNG BLOSSOMS PUT INTO WATER WITH A SMALL QUANTITY OF OIL OF TARTAR PER DELIQUIUM FROM A DARK REDDISH COLOR BECAME A LIGHT BROWN BUT FROM THE SAME PROPORTION OF OIL OF VITRIOL IN WATER THEY TURNED TO A FINE CARMINE COLOR WHICH STAINED THE PAPER OF A FINE RED THIS POINTS OUT ITS ASTRINGENT QUALITY BEFORE I COME TO THE BOTANICAL CHARACTERS OF OUR FLORIDA ILLICIUM I MUST OBSERVE THAT IT APPEARS TO ME TO BE A DIFFERENT SPECIES FROM THE ORIENTAL ONE THE SEED VESSELS FROM CHINA WHICH ARE TO BE SEEN IN COLLECTIONS OF THE MATERIA MEDICA ESPECIALLY AMONG FOREIGNERS SMELL VERY DISAGREEABLY OF ANISEED OUR FLORIDA SEED VESSEL IS AGREEABLY AROMATIC AS ARE THE LEAVES AND YOUNG BRANCHES THE FLOWER ACCORDING TO KAEMPFER IS OF A YELLOWISH WHITE AND LOOKS AT A DISTANCE LIKE A NARCISSUS OURS IS OF A DARK RED COLOR KAEMPFER RECKONS THE NUMBER OF PETALS SIXTEEN AND THE RAYS OR SEEDVESSELS EIGHT THE NUMBER OF PETALS IN OURS IS FROM TWENTYONE TO TWENTYSEVEN AND THE SEEDVESSELS TWELVE OR THIRTEEN THAT RIPEN IN RESPECT TO THE FORM AND GROWTH OF THE TREE THEY ARE MUCH THE SAME FOR INSTANCE THEY BOTH GROW TO THE SIZE OF A CHERRYTREE THEIR LEAVES ARE OF AN OBLONG OVAL SHAPE POINTED AT BOTH ENDS FLESHY WITH FEW VEINS GROWING ALTERNATELY AND IN TUFTS AT THE ENDS OF THE SMALL BRANCHES DR LINNAEUS WHO TAKES HIS CHARACTERS OF THE ILLI CIUM ANISATUM GEN PLANT P 244 FROM KAEMP FER PLACES IT AMONG THE DODECANDRIA POLYGYNIA BUT I AM PERSUADED YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME THAT FROM THE529 THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERS OURS MUST BE OF THE POLY ANDRIA POLYGYNIA AND SHOULD STAND NEXT TO THE MAG NOLIA CHARACTERS OF THE ILLICIUM FLORIDANUM OR FLORIDA STARRY

J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1076954,MODERNLANGUAGE INSTRUCTION IN NORMAL SCHOOLS,I244660,DISCUSSION MODERNLANGUAGE INSTRUCTION IN NORMAL SCHOOLS WHEN THE FIRST NORMAL SCHOOLS WERE FOUNDED IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE LATE THIRTIES AND EARLY FORTIES OF THE PAST CENTURY THE MODERN LAN GUAGES WERE NOT MADE A PART OF THE CURRICULUM FOR THE REASON THAT THERE WAS NO GREAT DEMAND FOR TEACHERS IN THESE SUBJECTS IN THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS BUT AS TIME PASSED AND THE COURSES WERE ENLARGED AND BROADENED AND AS THE MODERN TONGUES BECAME A PART OF THE COURSE IN OUR PUBLIC SECONDARY SCHOOLS FRENCH AND GERMAN WERE ADDED TO THE NORMALSCHOOL TRAINING ALONG WITH LATIN AND GREEK IT IS A MATTER OF INTEREST TO INQUIRE WHETHER UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE STUDY OF EDUCATION AND EDUCATIONAL METHODS IN NORMAL SCHOOLS THE METHOD OF INSTRUCTION IN MODERN LANGUAGES HAS SHOWN IMPROVEMENT BEYOND THAT FOUND IN THE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WHICH UNTIL LATE YEARS HAVE MADE BUT LITTLE OF THE STUDY OF METHODS THIS PROBLEM MAY BE APPROACHED IN VARIOUS WAYS BUT IT MUST BE SOLVED NO DOUBT BY A COMBINATION OF SEVERAL METHODS THE BEST METHOD WOULD BE PERSONAL VISITATION OF THE CLASSROOMS BY A COMPETENT JUDGE BUT SINCE NO ONE PERSON IS ABLE TO VISIT ANY GREAT NUMBER OF CLASSROOMS IN THE VARIOUS SECTIONS OF THE COUNTRY WE SHALL PROBABLY NEVER HAVE AN ESTIMATE BASED ENTIRELY UPON THIS METHOD AN AUXILIARY METHOD IS TO NOTE THE TEXTBOOKS USED AND THE STATEMENT CONCERNING COURSES AND METHODS USED IN THE SCHOOLS AS PUBLISHED IN THEIR CATALOGUES AND FINALLY ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE TEACHERS THEMSELVES THEIR TRAINING GENERAL SCHOLARLY ACTIVITY AND THE BOOKS THEY PUBLISH FORMS A FAIRLY RELIABLE CRITERION OF THEIR CLASSROOM WORK FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS STUDY PERSONAL VISITATION WAS MADE USE OF TO SOME EXTENT PRINCIPALLY IN THE SCHOOLS OF THE CENTRAL WEST AND THE NORTH WEST AND THE RESULTS OF SUCH OBSERVATIONS ARE INCLUDED IN THE DATA ON METHODS GIVEN BELOW BEYOND THIS THE METHODS IN USE WERE DETERMINED FROM CATALOGUES AND MORE ESPECIALLY INFERENTIALLY FROM THE DESCRIPTION OF THE COURSES IN THE CATALOGUES AS TO THE TEXTBOOKS USED IN NORMAL SCHOOLS THE DECIDED TENDENCY TO USE THE LESS BULKY GRAMMARS WOULD INDICATE THAT LESS STRESS IS LAID ON GRAMMATICAL MINUTIAE AND MORE UPON THE ABILITY TO READ OR TO READ AND SPEAK BEYOND THIS THERE IS LITTLE DIVERGENCE FROM THE BOOKS USED IN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES 694DISCUSSION THERE IS LITTLE INFORMATION AVAILABLE CONCERNING THE PREPARATION OF THE TEACHERS OF MODERN LANGUAGES IN NORMAL SCHOOLS BUT IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT NORMALSCHOOL TEACHERS AS A WHOLE HAVE RATHER INADEQUATE PREPARATION AND THAT INBREEDING IS PREVALENT IN THESE SCHOOLS CERTAIN IT IS THAT THE TEACHERS OF MODEM LANGUAGES DO NOT FIGURE AT ALL PROMI NENTLY IN THE MEETINGS OF THE MODERN LANGUAGE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA NOR IN THE VARIOUS STATE AND SECTIONAL MODERN LANGUAGE ASSOCIATIONS AS MAY BE SEEN BY RUNNING THROUGH THE VOLUMES OF THE PUBLICATIONS THERE ARE COMPARATIVELY VERY FEW SCHOLARLY CONTRIBUTIONS BY NORMALSCHOOL TEACHERS MERIAM2 HAS SHOWN THAT THE PROPORTION OF WORKS BY NORMAL SCHOOL HIGHSCHOOL AND COLLEGE TEACHERS IS 5 13 AND 48 ONE SHOULD EXPECT HOWEVER THAT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE STUDY OF EDUCATIONAL METHODS IN THE NORMAL SCHOOLS THE TEACHERS OF THE MODERN TONGUES WOULD HAVE BECOME DISSATISFIED WITH OUR OLD STYLE OF TEXTBOOKS AND WOULD HAVE DEMANDED BETTER LONG ERE NOW WHEN THE DIRECT METHOD IS BEING IMPORTED FROM EUROPE BUT SUCH HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE RATHER HAVE THEY BEEN CONTENT TO USE MUCH THE SAME TEXTS USED IN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AND EVEN IN THE HIGH SCHOOLS AND THEY HAVE FURNISHED PROPORTIONALLY FAR FEWER MODERN LANGUAGE TEXTS THAN HAVE THE COLLEGE TEACHERS AN EXAMINATION OF THE CATALOGUES OF FOUR OF THE MOST PROMINENT PUBLISHERS OF MODEM LANGUAGE TEXTS IN THE UNITED STATES DISCLOSES THE FACT THAT NORMALSCHOOL TEACHERS HAVE FURNISHED LESS THAN 5 PER CENT OF THE GRAMMARS INTRO DUCTORY BOOKS AND MANUALS OF COMPOSITION AND CONVERSATION PUBLISHED IN THIS COUNTRY HOWEVER AFTER THIS RATHER ADVERSE ARRAIGNMENT WHICH MUST CER TAINLY IN GREAT PART BE LAID TO THE PENNYWISEANDPOUNDFOOLISH CUSTOM OF OVERLOADING THE TEACHER WITH TEACHING IN THESE SCHOOLS IT MUST BE RECORDED THAT THE TEACHERS OF MODERN LANGUAGES IN NORMAL SCHOOLS HAVE MADE MORE RAPID ADVANCE IN THE ACTUAL CLASSROOM USE OF THE DIRECT METHOD THAN HAVE THEIR COLLEAGUES IN THE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES THE DIRECT METHOD AIMS TO TEACH THE FOREIGN LANGUAGE FOR THE GREATEST PART WITHOUT THE INTERVENTION OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR IS THOROUGHLY TAUGHT ALTHOUGH PARTIALLY INDUCTIVELY AND IN SMALL INSTALMENTS WHILE CONVERSATIONAL ABILITY IS CONSIDERED A VALUABLE BYPRODUCT THIS METHOD WHICH IS NOW IN THE OPINION OF MOST COMPETENT JUDGES THE MOST J L MERIAM

I3 PER CENT OF THE 117 NORMAL SCHOOLS INVESTIGATED BUT IS USED IN ONLY 5 PER CENT OF OUR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES 890 MODERN LANGUAGE DEPARTMENTS INVESTIGATED AND THIS MUST BE ATTRIB UTED IT SEEMS TO ME TO THE EMPHASIS LAID ON THE STUDY OF METHODS IN NORMAL SCHOOLS HERE IS A GROUP OF TEACHERS WHO IN POINT OF TRAINING AND OF TIME TO DEVOTE TO RESEARCH ARE LESS FORTUNATE THAN THE COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY MEN BUT THEY HAVE UNDER THE CONTINUAL NEEDS AND INSPIRA TION OF PUPILS WHOM THEY ARE TRAINING FOR A SPECIFIC SERVICE STRIVEN TO GIVE TO THEIR STUDENTS NOT ONLY A KNOWLEDGE OF THE GRAMMAR AND THE LITERATURE BUT OF THE SPOKEN LANGUAGE AS WELL TO BE SURE THIS ADVANCE IS NOT PHENOMENAL BUT IT IS NOTICEABLEAS WE WILL SHOW STILL FURTHER THE GRAMMARREADINGCONVERSATION METHOD IS AN EXCELLENT METHOD IT CONSISTS IN MAKING THE START WITH THE GRAMMAR IN ENGLISH BUT READING FORMS THE CENTER OF THE INSTRUCTION WITH CONVERSATIONAL ABILITY AS A THIRD OBJECT TO ACHIEVE THE LAST THE TEXTS ARE OFTEN DISCUSSED IN GERMAN INSTEAD OF MERELY TRANSLATING THE ENTIRE PASSAGE INTO ENGLISH THIS METHOD IS THE MOST PREVALENT ONE IN NORMAL SCHOOLS AND IS FOUND IN 51I PER CENT OF THESE SCHOOLS WHEREAS IT IS USED IN ONLY 37 PER CENT OF THE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES THE GRAMMARTRANSLATION OR GRAMMARREADING METHOD IS A DIS TINCTLY INEFFICIENT METHOD WHICH AIMS TO TEACH BY MEANS OF PARADIGMS AND SET TRANSLATION AFTER THE TIMEHONORED FASHION OF INSTRUCTION IN THE CLASSICS THIS METHOD IS USED IN 42 PER CENT OF THE COLLEGES BUT IN ONLY 23 PER CENT OF THE NORMAL SCHOOLS2 CHARLES HART HARDSCHIN MIAMI

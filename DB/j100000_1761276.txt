environment becomes less favorable and as male births are then in excess lie believes that the excessive production of males is an adaptation which has gradually been acquired by natural selection for the purpose of preventing close interbreeding at the time when it is injurious but as an injurious property cannot be established by natural selection the evil effects of interbreeding cannot be primary The end which is advantageous and which has been secured by natural selection is the crossing or sexual union of individuals which are not closely related As the object of crossing is to secure variability it is most necessary when change is needed that is when the conditions of life are unfavorable Natural selection has accordingly acted to secure this by rendering the offspring of a cross more able to resist an unfavorable change than the offspring of closely related parents or the parthenogenetic chil dren of a single parent and the excessive production of males under an unfavorable environment is for the purpose of securing variation rather than the prevention of interbreeding This very suggestive topic opens many fields for research where our information is very scanty and any readers of Science who are able to contribute information regarding the number of births of each sex in wild or captive or domestic animals will help to a clearer insight into an extremely interesting and important problem The writer will gladly receive and tabulate information upon this point and will give proper credit to contributors W K BnOOKS Johns Hopkins university Baltimore IJ CONTEMPORARY SOCIALISM Contenmporary socialism By JOHN RAE MA New York Scribner 1881 13  455 p 8 AMONG the merits of this volume may be mentioned the spirit with which the subject of socialism is approached The author under standing that his position is not that of an ad vocate either of existing society or of any pro posed future social form attempts to present an impartial but critical account of the schemes which contemporary socialists assure us will inaugurate an earthly paradise Mr Rae in dulges neither in abuse nor declamation nor frightened outcry but manifests a judicial calmnness of temperament befitting a man of science The scope of this work is indicated by the titles of the chapters which are the following Introductory containing a preliminary survey of the field Ferdinand Lassalle Karl Marx The federalism of Carl Marlo The socialists of the chair The Christian socialists Russian NCE VOL IV No 97 nihilism Socialism and the social question Progress and poverty HIenry George The arrangement of topics is not at all what one might expect and is due perhaps to the fact that the book consists in part of articles previously published in the Contemporary re view and the British quarterly These have been enlarged and supplemented with addi tiofial chapters and the old and new are not well joined together It exhibits more or less of the character of patchwork in many places eacl chapter not leading naturally to the fol lowing nor being an outgrowth of what has preceded Thus Lassalle who built on Marx and Rodbertus and who simply interpreted their doctrines to the common people kindling in their breasts a fire of enthusiasm not yet extinguished is treated in the second chapter while Karl Marx his logical predecessor fol lows Rodbertus the father of scientific so cialism in Germany of whom Mnarx is only a further evolution receives no separate treat ment at all and is barely alluded to in the chapter on Marlo The greatest figure in modern socialism is thus passed by in scarcely half a dozen words in a work professing to give a picture of contemporary socialism French socialism fares scarcely better receiv ing only three or four pages in the introduc tory chapter and that in a work of four hundred and fiftyfive pages This is certain ly inadequate Ienry George on the other hand who it is acknowledged is not a socialist in the ordinary acceptation of the term re ceives seventyseven pages The book is a disappointment because it is a series of detached essays instead of a con nected whole and is not what a perusal of the authors articles in the Conternporary re view might reasonably have led one to expect The entire work betrays either indolence or lack of sufficient time for the adequate per formance of the authors task for it ought to have been rewritten the style improved a more philosophical and symmetrical arrange ment secured and more careful attention given to the most recent phases of con temporary socialism Parts of the book were written several years ago and though per haps true then are not accurate now and even in the apparently more recent additions there is an oversight of what is transpiring at the present time Thus on p 56 Mr Rae uses these words England is the only great country where socialism has at present neither organ nor organization that reaches the public eye or ear This sounds strange for in this country we hear frequently l   DECEMBER 12 1884 SCIE of the  democratic federation and at least three periodicals of a radically socialistic na ture are supportedviz the monthly To day and the weeklies Justice and Christian socialist  while Hyndmans books  England for all The historical basis of socialism etc have certainly attracted wide discussion as have also the contributions of the poet Morris to the literature of socialism Ameri can socialistic movements likewise receive entirely inadequate attention and the im pression is conveyed that there is practical ly no American socialisma most radical error One of the peculiarities of modern socialism is its unexpectedness wherever it makes its ap pearance This is brought out in several places by Mr Rae Referring to German socialism on p 61 he says  Professor Lorenz von Stein of Vienna   who wrote an acute and thoughtful book on French communism in 1842 says in that work that Germany unlike France and particularly England had nothing to fear from socialism because Germany had no proletariate to speak of Yet in twenty years we find Germany become suddenly the theatre of the most important and formidable embodi ment of socialism that has anywhere appeared This is a correct statement Again and again it was said that communism was a French disease from which Germany had nothing to fear as her peaceloving laborious frugal and contented laborers could never become infected with the poison of discontent Now to use a socialistic phrase she leads the labor battalions of the world Less than ten years since Englishmen boasted that socialism was a conti nental plague from which the free institutions of England and the manly selfreliant char acter of her sons forever exempted the British Isle now it is doubtful whether socialism has anywhere a more respectable following and even the government is influenced by socialistic ideas A tinge of socialism is diffusing itself over the institutions of England the classic land of laissezfaire And in America how proud has been our selfconfidence With what satisfaction have we pointed to our broad prairies offering homes to all With what con tentment have we talked about the prosperity of the American laborer  With what scorn have we referred to the pauper labor of Europe Surely no sane man could expect a social disease like socialism in the United States But here it is and it is nowhere making more rapid strides The proof of this is on every hand It is but necessary to open ones eyes and watch the movements of the laboring NCE 535 classes rTheir parades mottoes laborunions newspapers conventions and congresses tell the tale but of all these Rae has little or nothing to say The book is timely and it is unfortunate that our author did not do himself better justice in a more carefully prepared treatise THE FACE OFJ THE EARTH Das antlitz der erde By E SUEss Abteilung i Leipzig Freytag 1883 310 p

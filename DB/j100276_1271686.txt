nothing from it made inquiry some ten days after sending it and found it had not been received After waiting several days longer further inquiry was made by defendant but the check had not yet been received by the drawee Plaintiff was not notified of these facts until nearly a month after he made the deposit At the request of defendant plaintiff procured a duplicate check to be drawn which was mailed direct to defendant by the drawer This check was marked duplicate with the notation Original not payable and plaintiff called at the bank and indorsed it Upon presentment payment was refused for lack of funds and defendant charged the amount back against plaintiffs account Plaintiff sues to recover this amount as part of the balance of his account Held that the plaintiff could recover Aebi v Bank of Evansville I905  Wis  Io2 N W Rep 329 Through the negligence of defendant in failing to present the check for payment within a reasonable time the indorser was discharged from liability whether his rights were substantially affected by such negligence or not Wymore First National Bank v Miller 43 Neb 791 40 Am St Rep 499 7 Cyc 979 22 L R A 785 note As to what is a reasonable time must depend upon the circumstances of each particular case except in so far as the matter is regulated by statute See DANIELS NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS 4th Ed Vol II Sec 464 But it was contended here that by indorsing the duplicate check with knowledge of the facts plaintiff waived the benefit of his discharge Had the indorser made an express promise to pay with full knowledge of the laches no doubt he would have been held liable Tebbetts v Dowd 23 Wend N Y 379 Ross v Hurd 71 N Y 14 27 Amer Rep I But waiver being in derogation of the rights of the indorser will be strictly construed AM  ENG ENCY Vol V p 1049 In the present case the court seems to be well supported by reason and authority that there was no new promise to pay The duplicate instrument was merely representative as a substitute for the original and indorsing it created no new contract whatever A like decision on the same point was reached in the case of Bank of Gilby v Farnsworth 7 N D 6 See also Benton v Martin 52 N Y 570 BILLS AND NOTESINDORSEMENT OF PAYEE FORGED BY DRAWERRECOVERY BY DRAwEEPlaintiff agreed to advance money to A for purchase of cattle by honoring drafts drawn on him by A each draft to have on the back thereof a bill of sale to plaintiff of the cattle for which it was given in payment A drew drafts in favor of B et al indorsed their names thereon and also filled out and signed with their names the bills of sale on the back These drafts he procured to be cashed by the defendant bank which through another bank collected them from plaintiff who did not discover the fraud until some months afterward Plaintiff then demanded repayment from defendant and upon the latters refusal brought suit Held that plaintiff could recover LaFayette  Bro v Merchants Bank of Fort Smith I905  Ark  84 S W Rep 700 The general rule in such cases where money has been paid under a mis take of fact is that it may be recovered Mer Nat Bank v Nat Bank of 478RECENT IMPORTANT DECISIONS Commerce 139 Mass 513 Thompson v Bank 82 N Y i But to this rule there is the well settled exception that where a draft with a forged indorse ment has been put into circulation by the drawer or his agent no recovery is allowed by the drawee as against the bona fide holder to whom he has paid Hortsman v Henshaw ii How I77 The latter class of cases are held to be analagous to those where a draft is drawn and indorsed in the name of a fictitious payee in which case the drawer or his principal is estopped to deny its validity Meachers v Fort 3 Hill S C 227 Phillips v Mer Nat Bank 140 N Y 556 23 L R A 554 Coggill v Amer Ex Bank t N Y II3 49 Amer Dec 3IO By virtue of the relations in this case between the drawee and the drawer it was argued that the exception to the general rule as to mistake ought to apply and the defendant be discharged But the court held very justly it seems that the bill of sale on the back of the draft was sufficient notice to defendant of the arrangement between drawer and drawee to have put defendant on its guard and that the bill of sale was really a part of the draft Thus though the signature on the draft was genuine the instrument itself was fraudulent and defendant must suffer the loss Weisser v Dennison o1 N Y 69 note 12 L R A 791 5 CYC 547 et seq CONSTITUTIONAL LAWEQUAL PROTECTION OF THE LAWSMASTER AND SERVANTRAILROAD FELLOW SERVANTS ACTAction to recover damages for the wrongful death of plaintiffs intestate a fireman on an engine of defend ant resulting from a collision due to the negligence of the engineer of another train The action is brought on the Ohio Act of 1890 p I50 which renders a railroad company liable for the negligence of a superior fellow servant and makes all employees having control of one or more employees a superior The defense was that the law is unconstitutional as class legisla tion Held that the classification established by the Act is reasonable and valid Kane v Erie R Co I905 133 Fed Rep 68i The principle is well established that the states have a right to make dis criminations provided they are founded on a reasonable basis and it is doubt ful whether the classification established by the Act in question is reasonable because as it was argued in the lower court 128 Fed Rep 474 it gives a remedy to some employees and denies it to others the test being whether the negligent employee was a superior fellow servant However inasmuch as the Act in question has been before the Ohio Supreme Court incidentally and that court has upheld its constitutionality R R Co v Shanower I904 70 Oh St I66 and Margrat v R R 5I Oh St 130 and the majority of the Ohio inferior courts have upheld it in cases where its validity was directly in question Roe v R R I3 Oh Dec 26o Froelich v R R 24 Ohio Cir Ct Rep 359 Ry Co v Hottman 25 Oh Cir Ct Rep I40 but see Malby v R R I3 Oh Dec 280 it seems that the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals is justified in holding the statute constitutional under the maxim that statutes are presumed to be constitutional unless the contrary is apparent Before the enactment of the Act of I8go it was the rule in Ohio that where one employee is put under the control of another the railroad company is liable for injuries 479

Among uncivilized people Dr Favres results from Algiers already alluded to show 414 examined and only 26 per cent colorblind Dr Fox reports 161 young Indians in the United States tested and only 181 per cent are colorblind These percentages so low compared with those for civilized people suggested to us the thought that colorbindness may be a product of civilization and these have led to our own tests here reported At the Haskel Institute at Lawrence Kansas are several hun dred Indians representing many tribes These we have recently tested by Holmgrens method with Berlin worsteds 418 have been examined  285 males and 133 females only three cases of colorblindness exist or only 7f of 1 per cent These were males and all fullblooded Indians The tribes were Pottawa tomie Pawnee and Cheyenne Of these two had defective color sense for red and one for green The Indians were almost evenly divided as fullbloods and half breeds It seemed to us that the halfbreeds showed more in stances of blunted colorsense than the fullbloods This was evidenced in more frequent and prolonged hesitation among them in comparing the colors than among the fullbloods If this be confirmed by more extended examinations it would in conjunction with the low percentages obtained as above be a strong argument for the theory proposed by us that defective color vision is in some way the product of civilization To this conclusion ouI tests at least seem to point The data are too meagre at present to propose any explanation why defective colorvision comes with civilization It is not accidental that nearly every case of colorblindness is for red fewer for green and seldom one for violet What is the meaning that the defects are thus limited at present at least to the lower end of the spectrum  The Helm holtzYoung theory of color perception will locate the affection in the layer of rods and cones responding to the first of the three primary sensations of color But why this special layer is with few exceptions the only one affected has at present no explana tion Also why the percentage among females is so small has no explanation The law of heredity indicates increased sensitiveness in those nerves which are subjected to special use through many genera tions It seems reasonable to look for an explanation of the more perfect colorsense in females to this factbut whether this law of heredity will increase the percentage among males cannot be foretold without an enormous increase of data The theory here proposed is that defective colorsense is a product of civilization with the use of tobacco as a possible fac tor The nonuse of tobacco would explain also the low percent age of colorblindness among females This theory leads to the thought of increase of colorblindness in males in the future gen erations THE VERTICAL SCRIPT BY W H METZLER BOSTON MASS I PRESUME that most of the people of this country were taught to write the slanting script according to a code of rules such as that given by Spencer DeGraff and others It would be interesting to know what proportion have continued consciously or uncon sciously to observe those rules and what proportion have for saken them for a position of body pen and book more suited for rapidity and ease and no doubt in many cases better from an hygienic standpoint Little observation will be required to convince us that there are but few who observe the rules they were taught Some years ago I had charge of about one hundred and twenty five pupils in writing who had been taught the slanting script according to Spencers rules After using that method a short time I became convinced that the collapsed position which very many assumed was due to the methods When allowed to write VOL XXI No 539 as they pleased about 5 per cent of them observed all the rules about 70 per cent observed part of them but not all and the re mainder apparently observed none of them Those pupils placing the book directly in front with about an equal amount of both forearms on the desk sat most erect and wrote a script varying but little from the vertical and those turning the right side placing the right forearm on the desk parallel to its edge sat least erect Observing this and my own experience having taught me that with paper directly in front I must sit more erect could write faster and with a good deal more ease than with it at the right I directed the pupils to place their writingbooks in front of them and found beneficial results follow in that the body was kept more erect and the writing on the whole much improved At that time I had not heard of what is now known as the verti cal script It together with the many evils resulting from the methods so commonly used in this country was first prominently brought to my mmd while attending a course of lectures given by Dr W H Burnham at Clark University in 189192 The substance of which is contained in an invaluable paper published in the Pedagogical Seminary Vol II No 1 Dr Burnham has made a thorough study of the subject of school hygiene and his paper gives besides a comprehensive bibliography the opinions and conclusions of the best writers and investigators of different countries and should be in the hands of all teachers and school boards The following are some of the rules given by Schubert for writing the vertical script   1 Straightcentral position of the tablet or copybook 2 Twothirds of both forearms should rest on the desk in sym metrical positions meeting at rightangles and forming an angle of 45 with the edge of the desk The elbows should be about a handsbreadth from the body 3 The hand should rest on the outer edge of the nail of the little finger The index finger should form a slightly convex bow 4 The penholder should be long and grasped not too near the pen Its upper part should not rest against the index finger but on the middle of the hand between the thumb and index finger and should point towards the elbow rather than towards the shoulder or breast 5 The arm as it moves toward the right in writing should bemoved as a whole so that all positions that it occupies will be parallel 6 After each line the paper should be correspondingly raised so that a proper distance between the point of the pen and the edge of the desk be preserved 7 The lines should be short 8 The lines joining the eyes and the shoulders should be horizontal and the eyes from 30 to 35 centimetres from the paper Since hearing the lectures and reading the paper I have made some observations to ascertain whether those placing the book directly in front of them sit more erect than those who place it at the right and though I did not find many who used the straTght central position yet I found that a larger per cent of those placing the book in front sit erect than of those placing it at the right Since so many evils are due to poor methods in writing it would seem that the subject should receive far more attention than has heretofore been given to it and the vertical script be given a thorough test at least The fact that no two handwritings like no two faces are exactly alike would indicate that after a few general instructions to secure a healthful position of the body no complex set of rules should be given Each person will then de velop that particular handwriting most suited to him DISINFECTANTS AND DISINFECTION BY DAVID BEVAN ID PHILADELPHIA PA THE question of disinfectants and disinfection has come to be of as great practical importance as it is of scientific interest The term disinfectant is by the laity and to some extent by the medical profession grossly misused in being considered as syn onymous with antiseptic and deodorant since science has so ably demonstrated the nature of the contagium in infectious and con tagious diseases only such agents as are capable of destroyingJUNE 2 1893 SCIENCE the contagium are to be designated as disinfectants An anti septic retards or prevents the development and pullulation of the organism but the organism is not destroyed A deodorant merely destroys odors but does not necessarily have any effect whatever upon the organism The cholera scare of last summer inaugurated a season of ap prehension and an unprecedented demand for disinfectants The universal cry for a disinfectant has given birth to a num ber of compounds the virtues  of which are only equalled by the number and chemical incompatibilities of their ingredients These compounds are often efficient deodorants sometimes they are antiseptics but never are they disinfectants To consummate the process of disinfection there are two essen tial requirements 1st that the substance to be acted upon is in fected 2d that the agent employed is a disinfectant During an epidemic or in sporadic cases of infectious diseases the effi ciency and adaptability of a given disinfectant will depend greatly upon the nature of the substance to be disinfected and also as to the presence or absence of spores The various subjects for disinfection will now be considered and under each the most available and efficient disinfectant Excreta Sputum or other Discharges By far the best disin fectant that we possess is the bichloride of mercury as in solu tion of 1 1000 it destroys anthrax spores after a few minutes exposure In using this salt three precautions are to be ob served 1st its extremely poisonous character 2d its corrosive action on all of the common metals and 3d the facility with which it combines with albumen to form an insoluble inactive compound That the dangers arising from poisoning may be reduced to a minimum it will be found expedient 1st to color the tablets or solution whichever it may be with one of the aniline dyes and further to keep the salt in a peculiarlyshaped bottle conspicu ously labelled In reference to the second precautionary measure it should never be used except in metallic vessels To prevent the salt combining with albumen acidulate the solution In Wilsons  Hygiene  we find the following formulae recom mended by the Local Government Board of Great Britain Dis solve half an ounce of corrosive sublimate one fluid ounce of hydrochloric acid and five grains of commercial aniline blue in three gallons of water Carbolic acid in a five per cent solution as a disinfectant for excreta though very popular is taken all in all extremely un satisfactory Upon adding such solution to a quantity of ex creta the additional dilution and the presence of large quanti ties of organic material decidedly interfere with its action and render it unreliable If carbolic acid be used it should be ac cording to the following formula  Carbolic acid Glycerine Water qs Mix 10 parts 10  100  Expose the excreta to an equal quantity of this solution for at least six hours Chloride of lime has been highly recommended in a solution containing four per cent of available chlorine Although the chloride of lime will not destroy the more highly resisting forms of contagium e g anthrax spores it is a most excellent agent for disinfecting the stools of cholera Asiatica and typhoid fever To make the above strength solution dissolve six ounces of the best chloride of lime containing twentyfive per cent of available chlorine in one gallon of water Underclothing bed linen towels napkins etc if of little value should be destroyed by fire otherwise we may expose them in a suitable apparatus to flowing steam for fifteen minutes or re sort to boiling for twenty minutes or immersing in a 1 1000 solution of the bichloride of mercury For disinfecting the hands we recommend one of the follow ing methods The nails should be short and clean The hands are thoroughly washed for several minutes with soap and water the water being as warm as can be comfortably borne and being changed frequently Use a brush which has been sterilized by steam The excess of soap is washed off with clean warm water The hands are immersed for one or two minutes in a warm saturated solution of permanganate of potash and are rubbed over thoroughly with  sterilized swab Then place the hands in a warm saturated solution of oxalic acid until they are completely decolorized Wash the hands with a steril ized salt solution of water Immerse the hands for two minutes in a 1 500 solution of the bichloride of mercury The above method is used by Welch of the Johns Hopkins Hos pital Professor Keen of the Jefferson Medical College Hospital uses the following method The hands are washed with soap and warm water the nails being cleaned and trimmed with a knife are then scoured with a sterilized brush All loose skin about the nails is removed The hands are again washed in warm water but without soap Im merse the hands in alcohol for two minutes and briskly rub one over the other They are then immersed in a 1 1000 solution of the bichloride of mercury This latter method is a most excel lent one The writer has tested the skin and nails of the hands after being sterilized as above directed and also the catgut and silk which were handled by the professor or his assistants with almost invariably negative results To disinfect the general surface of the body wash with a 1 2000 solution of the bichloride of mercury and then bathe in warm water Should a person die of an infectious or contagious disease the body must be cleaned and disinfected before removing from the isolation quarters To disinfect the body first wash it in clean water and then wrap in a sheet thoroughly saturated with a 1 500 solution of the bichloride of mercury So long as the source of infection remains there is a continuous reproduction of the poison It is impossible to disinfect a room during its occupancy by a person suffering with an infectious or contagious disease by liberating gaseous disinfectants as any such agents of sufficient potency will kill the patient However the wall furniture etc may be washed with a 1 2000 solution of the bichloride of mercury and then with warm water In such instances the greatest reliance is to be placed upon cleanliness and ventilation If these two provisions be thoroughly carried out offensive odors will be abolished or prevented from accumu lating in such force as to be disagreeably perceptible Ventila tion should never be effected through another room or hallway but communication established and maintained with the outside air and in such a manner as not to create draughts As soon as the infectious nature of the disease is determined the patient should be isolated The room should contain as few articles as possible All upholstered furniture and drapery should be re moved and their places supplied by wooden articles and simple muslin or linen curtains The attendant or attendants upon the sick should not be permitted to associate with other persons or to leave the isolated portion of the dwelling without first disin fecting their person and putting on clean clothes from the skin out The sending of unnecessary articles into the room such as extra napkins towels etc should be strictly interdicted Every thing coming from the sick quarters should be disinfected by one of the methods already indicated To disinfect the vacated room or rooms first disinfect and re move all the furniture etc then close all cracks and crevices about the windows and doors leaving one door open place in the room a tub in which there are about three inches of water In the centre of the tub place a large shallow pan preferably of iron containing two pounds of sulphur for every one thousand cubic feet of air space in the room Set fire to the sulphur and drop into the tub about the sulphur pan several very hot bricks Quickly leave the room close the door and all crevices about it The infected quarters are now airtight sulphurous acid gas is being generated so also is steam which will facilitate the action of the gas and secure better penetration The room is to remain thus for twentyfour hours then to be ventilated freely the surfaces washed with a 1 1000 solution of the bichloride of mer cury and lastly with warm water 299

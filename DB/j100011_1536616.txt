FEBRUARY 7 ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SPONTANEOUSLY PARTHENOGENETIC EGGS OF ASTERINA PATIRIA MINIATA H H NEWMANi INTRODUCTION While engaged in a series of experiments on echinoderm hy bridology which I was conducting during the months of April and May I920 at Pacific Grove California I was forcibly struck by the frequency with which spontaneous parthenogenesis occurs in the starfish Asterina Patiria minata When I use the term  spontaneous I mean that eggs were in no way treated either by physical or by chemical agents Precautions were taken moreover to prevent accidental fertilization The procedure was as follows Sea water brought in from the open sea and therefore free from the chemical impurities present in sea water that has been pumped through metal pipes was allowed to stand at least four days at laboratory temperatures which during the month of May ranged from 16 to I9 C It is certain that no sperms could live for this length of time in sea water This method is chosen in preference to Loebs practise of heating the sea water to 60 C for some time because it involves no possible chemical changes in the sea water nor any driving out of oxygen Before opening a starfish it was scrubbed thoroughly in cold running fresh water and rinsed in a strong stream of fresh water In case the animal proved to be a male it was discarded and hands and instruments were scrubbed in fresh water before touching another starfish If the animal proved to be a ripe female the ovaries were gently shaken into a fingerbowl containing 150 cc of the sea water prepared for the purpose and the bowl was cov ered with a clean glass plate and placed upon a table out of reach 1 From the Hopkins Marine Station of Leland Stanford Jr University and the Hull Zoological Laboratory of the University of Chicago 105H H NEWMAN of direct sunlight For purposes of observation eggs were re moved from time to time and placed in watchglasses with a ster ilized pipette It was thought safer not to run as direct controls normally fertilized eggs but on other days and under identical conditions numerous observations were made on the course of normal fertilization and development The differences observed between the behavior of parthenogenetic and that of fertilized eggs were so striking that it seemed well worth while to study and to describe them PECULIARITIES OF THE MATERIAL USED Asterina Patiria miniata is one of the commonest starfishes of the California coast It is a relatively small species in which the five rays are almost completely amalgamated with the central disc in such a way as to give the creature a nearly pentagonal out line In color it ranges from a brilliant scarlet to a light cream color with various intergrades and piebald combinations It seems likely that there are several subspecies that freely inter breed My experience seems to indicate that relatively few eggs mature at a time and are exuded in small numbers over a long season Among the very large number of females examined I never found an ovary that showed any large percentage of ripe eggs Those that were shed from the removed ovary and gently shaken in sea water contained o6cytes in all stages of develop ment some quite small others fully grown but incapable of mat uration still others mature and ready for maturation and fer tilization after standing about one and a half to two hours in sea water None of the eggs when freshly shed had undergone matu ration This may mean that the artificial shedding of the eggs is a premature process and that as seems to be the case in some asteroids if the eggs were to be normally extruded through the genital pores they would be immediately ready for fertilization I have never been able to observe the extrusion of eggs in As terina nor to induce it by massaging as can be done in some asteroids This may possibly be due to some peculiar sexual rhythm in this species which results in ovulation occurring only at night or at some particular phase of the moon or of the tide io6EGGS OF ASTERINA PATIRIA MINIATA On this point I have no evidence So it should be borne in mind that the eggs used in these experiments and presumably by Loeb who did a considerable amount of work upon artificial partheno genesis in this species are not the normally shed eggs equivalent to those which are fertilized in nature but are probably prema turely shed eggs It is very questionable therefore whether parthenogenesis ever occurs in nature It seems more probable that the parthenogenetic eggs observed in these experiments re sult from the artificial conditions involved in shedding some of the eggs prematurely The eggs of Asterina are very hardy and resistant of the cyto lytic action of sea water While the unmaturated o6cytes of most echinoderms begin to disintegrate within twentyfour hours those of Asterina frequently remain unchanged as though in stable equilibrium for from four to eight days I have before me a number of microscopic whole mounts showing numbers of eggs and larvae of Asterina fixed in Bouins solution on the eighth day after fertilization in which there occur a number of un matured oocytes with germinal vesicle cleancut and spherical and plasmosome well defined This ability of the unripe eggs to withstand disintegration is of great practical value in the study of development for the water is kept free from the products of egg decay a decided advantage in view of the fact that where there are small percentages of developing eggs surrounded by large percentages of nondeveloping eggs the former would have very small chance of survival if the latter were to decay and foul the water EXPERIMENTAL DATA Most of the detailed data on pathenogenesis in Asterina were obtained during the month of May I920 although the phenom enon was noted incidentally throughout April The month of May seems to be the best month for work with Asterina as there appear to be larger ovaries and more fullgrown o6cytes then than earlier Possibly June would be still better though I have not tried any experiments at that time Some thirtytwo experiments were made in all and no two gave exactly identical results A large series of ten experiments I07H H NEWMAN made on May 20 shows the full range of diversity and will serve to illustrate all of the points of interest As the time element is of prime importance in this study it is necessary to give readers as a norm for purposes of comparison a time schedule of the development of the normally fertilized Asterina TIME SCHEDULE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF NORMALLY

This culture was made the basis of a study of the more advanced development of parthenogenetic eggs and will be referred to in more detail in a subsequent dis cussion SIGNIFICANT POINTS BROUGHT OUT BY THE DATA SHOWN IN THE ABOVE SCHEDULE I Membrane formation occurs in exactly half of the experi ments here described It was observed in from I to 8 per cent of the maturated eggs 2 The degree of completeness of membrane formation varies greatly in different sets of eggs and in different eggs of a given set In some eggs the membrane is so little lifted from the sur face of the egg as to be scarcely noticeable but in others the membrane is indistinguishable from that seen in fertilized eggs 3 Eggs that form membranes whether narrow or wide do not further develop but undergo cytolysis within twentyfour hours 4 The percentage of maturated eggs that undergo partheno genetic development varies from none to about seventyfive in experiment II no cleavage occurred while in experiment X 75 per cent of all maturated eggs at least began cleavage The aver IIOEGGS OF ASTERINA PATIRIA MINIATA age number of parthenogenetic eggs is about two per cent of maturated eggs 5 Eggs that undergo parthenogenetic cleavage never form fertilization membranes the closely fitting vitelline membrane being the only envelope that surrounds the blastomeres 6 Cleavage in parthenogenetic eggs never begins earlier than six and one half hours after the eggs are placed in sea water and the average time for the beginning of cleavage is about seven and a quarter hours Cleavage begins in fertilized eggs sometimes as early as three and one half hours and the average time of be ginning is about four hours Subtracting two hours for matura tion to complete itself we have cleavage beginning five hours after maturation in parthenogenetic eggs and two hours after maturation in fertilized eggs There is therefore a retardation in development in the case of parthenogenetic eggs of three hours and at a very critical period   4 U 1 13 5 o 0 2 c G FIGS i6 Cleavage stages in spontaneously parthenogenetic eggs of As terina I An incompletely segmented twocell stage in which one blastomere is in advance of the other 2 A normal twocell stage 3 and 4 Irregular cleavage stages 5 A typical normal fourcell stage 6 A rather common type of abnormal cleavage in which one blastomere is undergoing cytolysis and the other is remaining normal 7 Cleavage and subsequent development in parthenogenetic eggs take place much more slowly than in fertilized eggs Even the most nearly normal parthenogenetic eggs take nearly twice as long to reach a given stage as do fertilized eggs Develop ment is therefore greatly retarded and we would naturally ex IIIH H NEWMAN pect the larvae to exhibit the various types of developmental de fects that are commonly seen in inhibited individuals 8 In none of the numerous experiments did parthenogenetic eggs give rise to even approximately normal bipennaria The most successful larvae were certain double monsters that will be discussed later 9 The average viability of parthenogenetic larvae varies greatly in different sets As a rule viability was lowest in those sets in which the smallest percentage of larvae occurred and highest in those in which the largest percentage of larvae occurred Io Individual viability varies greatly within a given set of eggs Quite frequently eggs die and disintegrate during the first or subsequent cleavages while it was not uncommon for a few larvae in each of the best sets to live for from four to seven days I  Cleavage in parthenogenetic eggs is sometimes very normal in appearance but in every set the majority of cleavage stages are irregular Figs I6 Sometimes blastomeres of the two cell stage separate and form halfsized blastulae seldom going further In other cases one or more blastomeres cease cleavage while the rest go on and form a covering of small cells about a large central cell Numerous other cleavage anomalies occur which need not be detailed here DISCUSSION Loebs Observations of Spontaneous Parthenogenesis in Asterina Doubtless the reader recalls the work of Loeb 1905 on Artificial membrane formation and chemical fertilization in a starfish Asterina In this paper the author describes various methods employed first for inducing membrane formation and second for inducing cleavage and subsequent development in the same species of starfish which forms the material of the present investigation Loeb recognizes the occurrence of spontaneous parthenogenesis in Asterina as is shown by the following quota tions  The eggs of the starfish show a slight tendency to develop spontaneously without any external influence If the eggs of Asterina are allowed to mature in sea water and are left to them selves sometimes none sometimes a fraction of a per cent some 112EGGS OF ASTERINA PATIRIA MINIATA times more will segment and develop into larvae But the de velopment of these eggs is much slower than that of fertilized eggs and as a rule the larva are not so perfect and die sooner We have therefore two types of development in these As terina eggs One type is represented by the fertilized egg and this type can be produced artificially in a number of eggs at least by calling forth the membrane formation by the abovenamed artificial means The second type is represented by the spon taneously developing egg in which no membrane has been called forth these latter eggs begin to segment later and possibly develop more slowly than the other eggs and form larvae which are not as perfect as those belonging to the first type It will be seen that Loeb has touched upon some of the essential points that are brought out in my experiments He notes that spontaneous parthenogenesis occurs in a small per cent of eggs that parthenogenetic cleavage takes place without membrane formation that cleavage begins later and that development is slower and less normal than is fertilized eggs Loeb however was not primarily interested in the course or results of spon taneous parthenogenesis but merely dealt with it incidentally as a check upon his work on artificial parthenogenesis or chemical fertilization He therefore merely points out the foregoing par ticulars without entering into any discussion as to their significance Spontaneous Membrane Formation In only one important point is there lack of essential agreement between his results and mine he failed to note any cases of spon taneous membrane formation which was so frequently noted in my experiments I am at a loss to explain this discrepancy between his results and mine both performed at Pacific Grove and both unquestionably safeguarded against accidental error Possibly the material behaves differently at different times of the year and Loebs work was done at quite a different time from mine which was confined to the last few days of April and the first three weeks of May The only difference in treatment be tween Loebs cultures and mine had to do with the methods of I13H H NEWMAN sterilizing the sea water in order to avoid normal fertilization Although he does not mention the fact in these particular experi ments his practice was to use boiled or highly heated sea water while I used sea water that had been kept in a demijohn for at least four days It seems barely possible that heating of the water prevents spontaneous membrane formation I would of course have tried this experiment had I known of Loebs detailed paper at the time of my experiments but I had with me only his book on Artificial Parthenogenesis and Fertilization and in that book he fails to mention the occurrence of spontaneous parthenogenesis in Asterina Heated sea water would doubtless be relatively poor in oxygen and this might be responsible for his failure to find spontaneous membrane formation It is possible also that this process membrane formation was so belated in its appearance that it occurred after Loeb had ceased to look for it in his cultures Unless one gets a very early start in experi ments with this material the working day is likely to be over before any signs of membrane formation appear and the next morning these eggs will have undergone cytolysis and their mem branes will have disappeared My plan was to make a before breakfast expedition to the collecting grounds get the material ready for work breakfast and be ready for experimentation by 800 AM If one begins to collect after breakfast it is likely to be nearly I oo AM before experiments with Asterina eggs could be commenced If such were the case it would be 600 PM before distinct membranes would be visible later than the time when the investigator habitually knocks off for the day It is barely possible then that Loeb may have missed spontaneous membrane formation in some such way as this Of the validity of my obervations there seems to be no doubt In answer to the criticism that failure to heat the seawater vitiates the observations it may be said that if these eggs with membranes are fertilized they should segment but they never do We seem to be forced to the conclusion therefore that membrane formation in Asterina which Loeb has been at such pains to bring about by chemical means occurs spontaneously in a considerable percentage of cases This being true the various manipulations II4EGGS OF ASTERINA PATIRIA MINIATA used by Loeb have merely served to hasten a natural process and to cause it to occur in a larger percentage of eggs Something in addition to membrane formation occurs in the eggs handled by Loeb for they go ahead and segment as do normally fertilized eggs while the eggs that form spontaneous membranes do not segment From this it would appear that the socalled fertilization membrane is not an essential feature of development but merely its usual accompaniment Thus the voluminous literature dealing with artificial membrane formation as though it were the most important event in the initiation of development loses some of its force Loeb himself recognized that development at least in Asterina could proceed without membrane formation witness his statement corroborated by my own observations that spontaneous parthenogenesis proceeds without the preliminary of membrane formation He seems to suggest however that this is not to be considered as typical de velopment since it begins later goes more slowly and results less normally than in the case of fertilized eggs Exactly similar results may be obtained however in fertilized eggs by the use of agents that retard development such as cold hybridization aneesthetics etc So we must admit that real development may occur without membrane formation and that membrane forma tion may occur without initiation of development The two processes are independent though they usually are associated in normal ontogeny The Development Spontaneously of Parthenogenetic Eggs of Asterina According to Loeb the development of the chemically fertil ized eggs differs from that of the spontaneously fertilized eggs in two respects first in forming membranes and second in be ginning earlier and proceeding more rapidly With this distinc tion I fully agree Evidently in the chemically fertilized eggs something in addition to membrane formation takes place a something that results in prompt initiation of the changes ex pressed by cleavage In the spontaneously parthenogenetic eggs however initiation to development is very slow in beginning and I 15H H NEWMAN is less effective when it does begin In last analysis the difference is evidently to be expressed in terms of rate of change The whole process of ontogeny in these eggs is from the beginning retarded and the results are exactly similar to those which may be obtained by the use of growthretarding agents applied to newly fertilized eggs The first effect of pronounced retardation of the normal growth process in the egg is the partial or complete obliteration of the characteristic axes of polarity and symmetry in the egg a breaking down of the axial gradient This results subsequently in loss of unity of organization involving physio logical isolation of blastomeres or of cell aggregates in double and triple polarity and consequent double or triple monsters and in a whole series of products of differential inhibition such as those described by Child for seaurchin 8 1 2a 8 lo 0 FIGS 7I2 Later developmental stages in spontaneously parthenogenetic eggs of Asterina 7 The commonly occurring solid blastula

in which I intend to discuss the physiology of twinning in general I shall not enter further into an account ofthe various types of inhibited larvae that result from spontaneous parthenogenesis for the same types result from several other kinds of inhibiting factors In closing I merely wish to emphasize this one point that the results of spontaneous parthenogenesis are those usually found to accom pany early growth retardation For a summary of this paper the reader is referred to the eleven points referred to on pages IO 112 and to the italicized clauses in the general discussion I am

NATHAN FAIRFAX TO THE PUBLISHER ABOUT A BULLET VOIDED BY URINE SIR I SENT A WHILE SINCE BY MR A C TO MR B FOR YOUR SELF A CERTAIN LEADENBULLET VOIDED BY A WOMAN AT THE PASSAGE OF URINE THE CIRCUMSTANCES RELATING TO WHICH I DESIGND TO COMMIT PRESENTLY AFTER TO A LETTER BUT WAS DIVERTED FROM IT TILL NOW THE RUDE HISTORY OF IT YOU MAY PLEASE TO TAKE AS FOLLOWS G ELIOT OF MENDLESHAM IN SUFFOLK A PALE MIDDLEAGD FULLBO DIED WOMAN SORELY AFFLICTED FOR SOME YEARES WITH A TORMENT OF THE BOWELS WAS PREVAILED WITH BY A NEIGHBOUR WHO HAD SUFFERD MUCH IN THE LIKE CASE TO SWALLOW TWO FIT BULLETS WHEREUPON SHE FOUND AS HE HAD DONE BEFORE HER PRESENT EASE BUT AFTER WARDS HER PAINS RETURND AND INCREASD AND SHE HAVING MANY CON FLICTS FOR ABOUT 15 YEARS THEN APPLYD HER SELF TO MY APOTHECARY MR GIBSON OF STOW MARKET WHO ADMINISTRED TO HER IN THE FIT A DOSE OF LADY HOLLANDS POWDER WHICH SHE TOOK IN POSSETDRINK IN THE MORNING WAS MOVD GENTLY BY IT IN THE AFTERNOON SPENT THAT NIGHT IN TORTURE OF BODY WITH VOMITINGS AND NEXT MORNING DURING THE USE OF THE CHAMBERPOT TOGETHER WITH THE URINE THERE CAME THAT FROM HER WHICH GIVING A TWANG AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE VESSEL SURPRISED HER WITH WONDER WHAT IT SHOULD BE AND THE URINE BEING POURED OFF WARILY THERE WAS LEFT IN IT A HEAVY AND TO APPEARANCE GRAVELLY STONE OF A COLOUR BETWEEN YEL LOW AND RED NEAR AS BIG AS ONS THUMBSENDS AS SHE CONFI DENTLY ASSERTS TO ME BUT MAKING USE OF AN HAMMER AND KNOCKING OFF THE OUTER PARS OF ITS CRUST THEY CAME AT A BUL LET INCLOSED IN IT OF A KIND OF BRAZEN COLOUR ON THE OUTSIDE BUT CUTTING A LITTLE WITH A KNIFE IT PROVED LEAD WITHIN WHICH BEING DISCOVERD COULD EASILY BE ACCOUNTED FOR ASKING HER IF NO IN QUIRY HAD BEEN MADE OF SUCH A BULLETS COMMING FROM HER BE FORE SHE TOLD ME THAT SOME DAYES AFTER SHE TOOK THEM THE STOOLS HAD BEEN SLIGHTLY EXAMIND BUT FINDING NEITHER THEY GAVE OVER SEARCH SHE BEING FURTHER ASKD ABOUT THE BIGNESS OF THE BULLET SHE TOLD ME IT WAS APPARENTLY BIGGER WHEN SHE TOOK IT THAN WHEN SHE VOYDED IT THE STATE OF HER BODY IN RE FERENCE TO THE STONE BEING INQUIRED INTO SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD BEFORE AND SINCE THAT BEFELL HER BEEN A VOYDER OF ABUNDANCE OF RED804 RED GRAVEL AND PARTICULARLY ABOUT THREE YEARES AFTER SHE TOOK THEM SHE VOIDED A CONSIDERABLE REDDISH STONE WHEN I ASKD HER ABOUT THE MANNER OF AFFECTING HER BODY AT THE COMMING FORTH SHE ANSWERD TWAS MUCH LIKE A COMMON FIT OF THE STONE ONELY IT HELD HER LONGER LASTING SOME WEEKS BOWD HER SADLY FORWARD AS A STONE OFTEN DOES IN THE URETERS PRO VOKD TO VOMITINGS AND PARTICULARLY SHE FELT IT CROWD LOWER AND LOWER FROM THE KIDNEY TO THE BLADDER IN THE LEFT URETER ASKING HER FARTHER WETHER SHE WAS SURE IT CAME BY THE PASSAGE OF U RINE AND NOT BY SIEGE SHE ASSURD ME SHE WAS NOT MISTAKEN IN THAT AND INDEED THE GRAVELLY COAT WHICH THE BULLET HATH SHEWS SUFFICIENTLY WHEREABOUT TWAS LODGD INQUIRING ALSO WHETHER THE OTHER BULLET WAS COME FROM HER SHE SAID NO FOR OUGHT SHE KNEW TWAS STILL IN HER BODY AND AS TO HER STATE SINCE THIS EVACUATION SHE SAITH THAT SHE HATH HAD EVER SINCE STONECOLLICKPAINS BUT NONE IN SO HIGH A DEGREE AS BE FORE THIS IS THE PLAIN RELATION OF THE MATTER OF FACT THE MAINE USE I WOULD MAKE OF THE INSTANCE IF IT BE WORTH MENTIONING IS TO STRENGTHEN A CONJECTURE I HAVE HAD A LONG TIME OF SOME OTHER PASSAGE FROM THE STOMACK TO THE BLADDER BESIDES WHAT ANATOMISTS HAVE HITHERTO GIVEN ACCOUNTS OF FOR THAT THIS BUL LET NEVER CAME AT THE URETERS THROUGH THE VEINES ARTERIES NERVES LYMPHEDUCTS THE ONELY VESSELS THAT CAN BE CHARGD WITH IT IS I THINK BEYOND DISPUTE IF IT SHALL BE SAID THAT NATURE WHEN PUT TO SHIFTS FINDS OUT STRANGE CONVEYANCES TO RID THE BODY OF WHAT IS EXTRANEOUS AND OFFENSIVE TO IT I READILY GRANT IT BECAUSE MANY INSTANCES ARE KNOWN MAKING THAT GOOD YET I THINK IT NOT SO PERTINENTLY URGD FOR AS MUCH AS SOME OTHER INSTANCES SEEM TO SIDE WITH IT WHICH CANNOT BE TAKEN OFF BY THE SAME EVA SION VIZ MANY DO FIND THAT DRINKING 4 OR 5 GLASSES OF RHE NISH FOR INSTANCE WITHIN LESS THAN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR THEY SHALL HAVE A STRONG LIST TO MAKE WATER ESPECIALLY IF THE BODY HATH BEEN AGITATED NOW THAT IT SHOULD PASS THROUGH THE LACTEALS VEINS HEART AND ARTERIES AND BE STRAIND FROM THE BLOOD IN SO SHORT A TIME IS TO ME SCARCE CONCEIVABLE BUT SURELY THIS SHORTER PASSAGE WHEREVER TIS IS AS NATURAL AS THAT BY WHICH IT SHOULD HAVE GONE HAD IT STAID LONGER IN THE BODY805 BODY NOT TO SAY HOW LITTLE IT FAVORS OF THE RANKNESS OF THE KIDNEYS AND HOW MUCH IT RESEMBLES THAT WHICH IT WAS BEFORE TWAS TAKEN INTO THE BODY AND METHINKS THE CONVEYANCE OF THE MILK INTO THE BREAST HATH MUCH AFFINITY WITH THIS OF THE URINE INTO THE BLADDER THE SUDDEN PRESSING WHEREOF INTO THE PAPPS AFTER THE NURSES DRINKING ORDINARY MILK COULD NO MORE BE EXPLAIN ED BY THE ORDINARY DOCTRINE OF CIRCULATION THAN THIS OF THE URINE INTO THE BLADDER TILL THE SHORTER CUT WAS HIT UPON BY THE DUCTUS THORACICI THOUGH ORDINARILY IT MAY BE STRAYND IN FROM THE AR TERIES AS THE SERUM ALSO IN THE KIDNEYS ONELY IN A MILKFLOUD NATURE FINDS SOME OTHER CHANNEL THERE AS HERE IN A WATER FLOUD LASTLY SOMETIMES THINGS ARE SHED FORTH AT THE NIPLES AL MOST AS MUCH SURPRIZING AS THIS WE HAVE SPOKEN OF AT THE NECK OF THE BLADDER BUT I AM PERHAPS TOO PROLIX IN MY REFLEXIONS OF WHICH I DESIRE YOU TO BELIEVE I HAVE AS MEAN THOUGHTS AS THE CANDIDST OF READERS SHALL I AM C WOODBRIDGE SEPT

results which he has obtained from observations made at Ply mouth Portsmouth and Sheerness under the superintendance of the masters attendant at those dockyards The establishments of these ports that is the time of high water when the moon passes the meridian at 12 oclock may now be considered as accurately determined The retard x at Portsmouth appears to be intermediate between that at Brest and at London being about 1h 3Om that at Plymouth appears to be greater and not less than that which obtains at London for which circumstance it is difficult to account The retard at Sheerness agrees with that observed at the London Docks The constant which involves the mass of the moon does not differ much as inferred from these observations at various places it is however im possible to obtain more than a rough approximation by these means to that important element in astronomy the mass of the Moon Even a minute of time in the difference of the interval between the moons transit and the cor responding time of high water materially affects the value of the moons mass and insurmountable difficulties appear to be in the way of any nice determination of that quantity by these means even if there were none of an analytical cha racter It would be well by a discussion of the inevitable errors of the various data employed to ascertain the limits of the errors which may be incurred in determining the mass of the moon by various methods particularly through the constant of the moons parallax Mr DEssIou with undaunted perseverance has just completed the discus sion of about 6000 more observations of the tides at the London Docks with a view to rest upon a sure basis the corrections for the moons parallax and declination but these cannot be published unless he is fortunate in meeting with more encouragement than he has hitherto experienced These results doMR LUBBOCKS NOTE ON THE TIDES not differ materially from those already published in the Phil Trans 1831i Part II p 413 the accuracy of which therefore they serve to confirm The results which Mr DEssIOU has obtained are not reconcileable with the theory of BERNOULLI therefore the Tables founded on this theory which profess to give the corrections for the moons parallax and declination and which are to be found in various works on navigation but had never previously been compared with observation must be rejected as inaccurate and utterly inapplicable The following Table has been formed by taking the mean of all the times of the moons transit occurring within a given half hour and the mean of all the corresponding times of high water according to the method explained Phil Trans 1831 Part II p 384 the difference is of course the interval between the time of the moons transit and the corresponding high water which inter val is given in the Table The following Table has been obtained by laying down the observed points and drawing a curve amongst them by the hand from which curve the inter

two groups of vessels involve very different questions though both are loosely referred to as the Packers Cases from the nature of their cargoes The vessels whose cargoes were in large part condemned

MORGAN WAR ITS CONDUCT AND LEGAL RESULTS 372I96 HARVARD LAW REVIEW declared to be absolute contraband3 Nearly all the consignments were  to order instead of being made to named consignees The court had to determine two questions in order to make both the rubber and the foodstuffs confiscable under the doctrine of continuous voyage It had to find first that the rubber as absolute contraband was destined for Germany and second that the foodstuffs as conditional contraband were destined not only for Germany but for the enemys forces It is advisable to consider the two questions separately To find that the cargoes were ultimately destined for Germany Sir Samuel Evans seems to have considered that the fact that these con signments were out of all proportion to the annual Danish imports of the same commodities raised a presumption against the claimants which they failed to rebut4 Sir Edward Grey however has intimated to our government that there was further affirmative evidence introduced against the claimants by the Crown5 Under strict prize procedure the admission of such evidence is questionable The longaccepted practice has been to confine the hearing to the ships papers and statements of the crew and only where this evidence was suspicious or unsatisfactory would there be an order for further proof Captors were held to such rigid exactness to avoid delay expense and uncertainty and to reduce this irritating interference with neutrals to a minimum by confining seizures to the clearest cases The rise of the doctrine of continuous voyage only increased the number of exceptional circumstances where further proof was necessary6 But the procedure of British prize courts has been altogether relaxed by the Prize Court Procedure Act of I914 SO thatexternal evidence may

searching about for further proof7 Without such evidence in the principal cases which the court showed a natural disinclination to rely upon the presumption arising from Denmarks increased imports was clearly inadequate8 It could only go to show that quantities of foodstuffs were being shipped to Den mark with the hope of resale and reshipment and this has never been deemed sufficient to allow the doctrine of continuous voyage to apply9 The second step which the court took in order to hold the foodstuffs confiscable was still more questionable It involved the application of two Orders in Council The first permitted the extension of the doctrine of continuous voyage to conditional contraband0 So many excellent ar ticles have been written on this doctrine that it is unnecessary to con sider its history in detail It is sufficient to say that there has never been a case which has applied the doctrine to conditional contraband where there has been no blockade The American cases of conditional contraband cited by Sir Samuel Evans were all cases where the doctrine was being applied on the basis of blockade and not simply on the basis of contraband2 Such an extension of the doctrine is particularly to be deplored when it is so generally conceded in thoughtful times of peace that the seizure of conditional contraband under the clearest circum stances involves loss and annoyance to the neutral which are not compen sated for by the benefit to the belligerent3 But the court in applying 7 4  5 GEO V c I3 MANUAL OF EMERGENCY LEGISLATION I914 256 274 The Naval Prize Act

placed upon a second Order in Council which declared that such a destination would be presumed where the goods were shipped to order 4 Sir Samuel Evans was doubtless bound to follow this Order in Council5 But the net result of doing so is a close approach to ignoring the distinction between food des tined for the civil population and for the enemys forces6 This result seems to be appreciated by England as would appear from the constant references to Germanys high state of organization and government control7 The fact however that every shipment to civilians releases pro tanto domestic foodstuffs to the military and that governments make necessary requisitions anyway indicates that the distinction does not rest upon a mere question of relative belligerent advantage but is another evidence of the desire of nations to confine narrowly the injurious effects of war upon strangers to the quarrel In short the decision of Sir Samuel Evans in its several steps appears to be nothing but an instance of the spirit of protective retaliation which tral commerce and shipping from the interference which the suppression by belligerents of the trade in contraband involves should receive your sympathetic consideration and if not otherwise open to objection your active support BRIT BLUE BOOK Misc No 4 I909 23 See also the admirable argument to this end by Earl Lore burn made as

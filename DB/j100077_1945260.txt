been adopted since the organization of our government have invariably provided for the removal of faithless public servants by a quasijudicial process known as impeachment for treason bribery negligence incapacity and other high crimes and misdemeanors Impeachment has proved to be a costly dilatory and unsatisfactory process comparatively few impeachment proceedings have ever been instituted and in at least one state it has been definitely abandoned In spite of a growing conviction that official delinquency was becoming more prevalent and in spite too of the immunity afforded to unworthy public officers by an unresponsive and sluggish method of removal no new or supplemental device was perfected until 1903 when a recall provision was incorporated in the Los Angeles charter The a9 Laws 1913 p 894 41 Laws 1913 p 450 40 Laws 1913 p 48622 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW widespread discussion of this wellknown measure has quickened the public conscience and the legislatures which have met during the last ten years have been unusually enterprising and ingeniousin devising and adopting new expedients for the discharge of dishonest and incompetent public officials or in reviving methods which had temporarily fallen into abeyance and disuse Moreover the number of cases in which the machinery which has been provided may be invoked has been greatly increased and acts of official delinquency and moral turpitude have been defined with greater particularity and precision A deliberate inspection of the legal literature covering the decade which has elapsed since the adoption of the celebrated recall provision of the Los Angeles charter discloses the significant fact that 33 states have either adopted new laws providing for the summary discharge of undutiful public officers or have strengthened their old laws by the passage of vigorous amendments or have somehow facilitated the power of removal While the movement for an easy and expeditious removal of public officers has not been confined exclusively to the western states it has undoubtedly achieved its greatest popularity in that section This is evidenced by the fact that of the 33 states which have adopted such laws during the past ten years 21 are western 2 are southern and 10 are eastern The number and variety of offenses for which a public officer may be removed have been greatly increased and differentiated and now include dishonesty corruption habitual drunkenness gambling delinquency unprofessional or disorderly conduct habitual and wilful neglect of duty incompetence disability financial irregularity gross partiality oppression extortion maladministration conscious obstruc tion to the due course of the administration of public affairs malpractice malfeasance nonfeasance misfeasance conviction of a felony or mis demeanor or any other cause deemed sufficient Some half dozen effective but widely dissimilar methods have been devised for cashiering delinquent public officials and the power of re moval thereby conferred is vested in specially constituted impeachment tribunals in the qualified electors themselves in the governor of the commonwealth in some designated court of competent jurisdiction in an executive administrative or legislative board or council in the governor and state senate acting jointly in the state legislature in the executive head of a department and in the mayor of a city Provision is also made for the mere ipso facto forfeiture of office Judging from the comparative prevalence of these methods we are justified in the conclusion that the most popular method of removal is the recall theLEGISLATIVE NOTES AND REVIEWS 623 least popular impeachment while removal by the governor or the courts are both in high favor Removal by Impeachment The operation of the process of removal by impeachment is well known Aside from the celebrated Sulzer case in New York the only recent impeachment proceeding of any conse quence was that of the Insurance Commissioner of the state of Washing ton a performance which cost the commonwealth upwards of 500001 In 1910 Oregon adopted a constitutional amendment prohibiting the impeachment of any public officer2 and only two States Alabama and Nevada have adopted any measures on the subject In 1905 Alabama authorized the impeachment of solicitors and sheriffs who neglect to enforce the law providing for the detection and suppression of crime3 and in 1909 Nevada provided for the impeachment of any civil officer of the State by a twothirds vote of the General Assembly4 Removal by the Plebiscite The process of removal which is most generally employed and which has attracted the widest attention is known as the recall a purely political device designed to provide for the discharge of a public official in the same manner in which he is elected by submitting the question to a vote of the proper constituency Los Angeles adopted this method in 1903 and a similar provision has since been adopted by 17 other cities and counties in California In addition 20 States including Arizona California Colorado Idaho Illinois Iowa Kansas Louisiana Michigan Minnesota Missouri Nebraska Nevada New Jersey North Dakota Ohio Oregon Washington Wisconsin and Wyoming have passed laws providing for the recall although this does nt seem to be the only form of removal which may be exercised in these states Removal by the Governor The power of removal which is exercised by the governor has two rather interesting and characteristic aspects The first relates to the nature of the process by which an official is re moved and the second to the classification of the officials upon whom this power is designed to operate One process of removal is predomi nantly an executive or administrative function by which an official is summarily ejected from office Theotherprocess is more clearly judicial in its character the governor sitting as a court hearing testimony sifting evidence and ultimately exercising his authority after the manner of a judge The officers whom the governor is authorized to remove a Laws Extra Session of 1909 pp i and 59

appointed solely or concurrently by the governor The former class have adhered most tenaciously to the vested interest theory of office Moreover these two aspects of the question appear in different combinations and will for convenience be so treated in this article 1 Removal of Appointive Officers by Judicial Process Removal of appointive officers by the governor exercising his power by judicial process affording a hearing to the accused and providing for the accu mulation and submission of pertinent testimony is in operation only in the State of Connecticut The necessary investigations are instituted by the attorneygeneral who cites the accused before the governor and affords him the opportunity to show cause why he should not be re moved5 2 Removal of Appointive Officers by Executive Action The power of the governor to remove public officers whom he has appointed is extensive and is authorized by 12 States including Delaware Iowa Missouri New Mexico New York Oregon Utah Vermont Washing ton West Virginia Wisconsin and Wyoming In New York and Wyoming6 the governor is authorized to remove any officer or com missioner appointed by hin and investigations instituted to ascertain the character of official delinquency in the former state have been so extensive that approximately 30000 has been appropriated since 1908 to defray the expense In the other 10 States the governors power is not so extensive and the specific officers over whom he is author ized to exercise the power of removal are designated The list includes special constables and delinquent tax agents8

Connecticut Iowa Kansas Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada Oregon Utah Wyoming and Ohio an officer against whom charges are preferred for alleged delinquency is given a hearing before a court of competent jurisdiction and the judge or the jury determines whether the offense with which he is charged is sufficiently flagrant to justify his removal An action may be instituted by a states attorney the attorneygeneral the grand jury the governor or by private citizens The Iowa Kansas Missouri Nebraska Nevada Ohio Oregon and Utah laws are substantially identical Practically all state district county township or city officers are subject to removal In Missouri the question is submitted to a jury in Iowa the case is tried without the intervention of a jury Except in the case of state officers appeals lie to the higher courts and take precedence over all other matters23 In Connecticut town clerks town treasurers highway commissioners justices of the peace and constables are subject to removal by the superior or the levy court24 In Montana the state inspector of mines is subject to removal if charges are preferred against him by 50 or more legal residents and sustained by the district court25 Wyoming provides for the dismissal of county commissioners only26 The procedure in removing commissioners of cities of the third class in Kansas is unique If any one of the three commissioners so conduct himself in office as to knowingly obstruct the due course of the administration of the affairs of the city the other two commissioners may notify him in writing specifying his objectionable acts all of which is entered on the journal If the delinquent commissioner remain obdurate and recalci trant his colleagues may join in a complaint to the judge of the district court who is required to cite the offender within 10 days and give him the opportunity of showing cause why he should not be removed from office27 22 Laws of Louisiana 1912 p 168 Minnesota 1913 p 670 Montana

TO RECOVER UNLESS AS CLAIMED BY THE DEFEND ANTS COUNSEL THE PLAINTIFF WAS GUILTY OF CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE WAS THE PLAINTIFF GUILTY OF SUCH CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION INVOLVES THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE ORDINANCE OF THE TOWN OF WAKEFIELD SUPRA ADOPTED MAY 12 1903 HAD THE1905 MURPHY V NORFOLK  WESTERN RY CO 127 PLAINTIFF BEEN A RESIDENT OF SAID TOWN IT WOULD BE UNNECESSARY AC CORDING TO THE DEFENDANTS VIEW OF THE CASE TO CONSIDER THE MEAN ING AND EFFECT OF SAID ORDINANCE BUT THE LAST SENTENCE OF SECTION 1 OF THE ORDINANCE WHICH MAKES IT UNLAWFUL TO ALLOW COWS AND OTHER LIVE STOCK NAMED THEREIN TO RUN AT LARGE WITHIN THE COR PORATE LIMITS OF THE TOWN OF WAKEFIELD READS AS FOLLOWS THIS ORDIANCE APPLIES TO ALL STOCK OWNED BY PEOPLE LIVING IN THE TOWN OF WAKEFIELD AND THE LAST SENTENCE OF SECTION 2 OF THE ORDINANCE THE SECTION WHICH RELATES TO BULLS AND BOARS READS AS FOL LOWS THIS ORDINANCE APPLIES TO THE ABOVE DESCRIBED STOCK OWNED BY PERSONS LIVING OUTSIDE OF THE CORPORATE LIMITS OF WAKEFIELD IT IS SAID BY JUDGE DILLON IN 1 DILLON ON MUNICIPAL CORPORA TION SECTION 322 AS IT WOULD BE UNREASONABLE AND UNJUST TO MAKE  AN ACT DONE BY ONE PERSON PENAL AND IF DONE BY ANOTHER NOT SO ORDINANCES WHICH HAVE THIS EFFECT CANNOT BE SUS TAINED  THE POWERS VESTED IN MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS SHOULD AS FAR AS PRACTICABLE BE EXERCISED BY ORDINANCES GENERAL IN THEIR NATURE AND IMPARTIAL IN THEIR OPERATION IOLT C J SPEAKING FOR THE COURT IN SIMRALL V COVINGTON 90 KY 44 SAYS PERHAPS THE MOST DISTINGUISHING FEATURE OF THE COMMON LAW IS ITS REGARD FOR THE PROTECTION AND EQUALITY OF INDI VIDUAL RIGHTS IT IS A RULE THEREFORE THAT WHEN THE BYLAWS OF A MUNICIPALITY ENACTED UNDER A GENERAL GRANT OF POWER OR BY VIRTUE OF ITS INCIDENTAL AUTHORITY IS UNFAIR AND PARTIAL IN ITS OPERATION IT WILL BE DECLARED VOID A BYLAW TO BE REASONABLE SHOULD BE IN HARMONY WITH THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF THE COMMON LAW SEE COOLEY ON CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS PAGES 200 AND 202 IT IS PLAIN THEREFORE THAT THE ORDINANCE OF MAY 12 1903 WHEN CONSTRUED AS A WHOLE AND ACCORDINGY AS ALLOWING THE STOCK OF NONRESIDENTS BULLS AND BOARS EXCEPTED TO RUN AT LARGE WITHIN THE CORPORATE LIMITS OF THE TOWN WHILST FORBIDDING THE RUNNING AT LARGE OF THE STOCK OF RESIDENTS OF THE TOWN BULLS AND BOARS EX CEPTED IS UNREASONABLE AND NEITHER GENERAL IN ITS NATURE NOR IMPARTIAL IN ITS OPERATION AND THEREFORE VOID AND UPON SUCH CONSTRUCTION OF SAID ORDINANCE THE CONTENTION OF THE DEFENDANT THAT THE PLAINTIFF WAS DOING AN ILLEGAL ACT WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE INJURY SUSTAINED BY HIM MUST BE OVERRULED BUT IT IS EARNESTLY AND ABLY CONTENDED BY THE DISTINGUISHED COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENDANT THAT UNDER THE RULE OF LAW THAT AN ORDINANCE LIKE A STATUTE MAY BE VALID IN PART AND VOID AS TO THE128 11 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER JUNE RESIDUE THE COURT SHOULD STRIKE OUT THE LAST SENTENCE OF EACH SEC TION OF THE ORDINANCE THE SENTENCE ABOVE QUOTED IN EACH SECTION THAT MAKES THE ORDINANCE UNREASONABLE AND PARTIAL IN ITS OPERA TION AND CONSTRUE THE RESIDUE OF THE ORDINANCE AS THOUGH THESE OBJECTIONABLE PARTS HAD NO EXISTENCE WITH THE RESULT THAT THE ORDI NANCE SO CONSTRUED WOULD APPLY TO COWS OWNED BY PERSONS RE SIDING OUTSIDE OF THE TOWN OF WAKEFIELD THE RULE IS THAT IF A BYLAW CONSISTS OF SEVERAL DISTINCT AND IN DEPENDENT PARTS ALTHOUGH ONE OR MORE OF THEM MAY BE VOID THE REST ARE EQUALLY VALID AS THOUGH THE VOID CLAUSES HAD BEEN OMITTED M  0 R R CO V STATE 29 ALA 573 THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL CASES IN VIRGINIA WHERE STATUTES HAVE BEEN HELD VALID IN PART AND VOID IN PART CARTER V COMMON WEALTH 96 VA 791 AND TRIMBLE V COMMONWEALTH 96 VA 818 THE RULE OF CONSTRUCTION AS TO STATUTES AND ORDINANCES IS THE SAME IN THIS RESPECT WHEN THE VALID PART IS SO CONNECTED WITH AND DEPENDENT ON THAT WHICH IS VOID AS THAT THE PARTS ARE NOT DISTINCTLY SEPARABLE SO THAT EACH CAN STAND ALONE AS THE WILL OF THE LAWMAKING BODY THE WHOLE MUST FALL BLACK V TROWER 79 VA 129 AND AUTHORITIES CITED IN PASSING THE ORDINANCE IN QUESTION IT WAS THE EVIDENT PURPOSE OF THE COUNCIL OF THE TOWN OF WAKEFIELD NOT TO PROHIBIT THE COWS OWNED BY NONRESIDENTS OF SAID TOWN FROM GOING AT LARGE WITHIN THE CORPORATE LIMITS OF SAID TOWN TO HOLD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE VIEW WHICH HAS BEEN URGED BY THE DEFENDANT THAT THE ORDINANCE IS VALID IN PART AND VOID IN PART WOULD BE IN EFFECT NOT ONLY TO MAKE A NEW ORDINANCE BUT ONE WHICH IT CANNOT BE ASSUMED THAT THE COUN CIL OF SAID TOWN WOULD HAVE BEEN WILLING TO MAKE THIS THE COURT HAS NO RIGHT TO DO AND THE QUESTION OF NEW LEGISLATION MUST BE LEFT TO THE COUNCIL OF SAID TOWN THE COURT IS THEREFORE OF THE OPINION THAT THE ENTIRE ORDINANCE IS INOPERATIVE AND VOID AND DOTH SO ADJUDGE AND THAT THE PLAINTIFF WAS NOT DOING AN ILLEGAL ACT WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE INJURV SUS TAINED BY HIM WHEN HE KNOWINGLY PERMITTED HIS COW TO GO AT LARGE IN THE CORPORATE LIMITS OF THE TOWN OF WAKEFIELD IT FOLLOWS NECESSARILY THAT THE PLAINTIFF IS ENTITLED TO RECOVER OF THE DEFENDANT THE VALUE OF HIS COW WHICH THE COURT ADJUDGES TO BE 30 WVHERE UPON IT IS CONSIDERED BY THE COURT THAT THE PLAINTIFF RECOVER OF THE DEFENDANT THE SAID SUM OF 30 AND HIS COSTS BY HIM IN THIS BEHALF EXPENDED

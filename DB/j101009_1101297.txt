unreasonable length of time in places where it is likely to attract stock running at large 2 MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS  Ordinances  anstruction An ordinance of a municipal corporation allowing the stock of nonresidents to run at large within the corporate limits whilst forbidding the running at large of the stock residents of the town is unreasonable and neither general in its nature nor impartial in its operation and is therefore void 3 MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONSOrdinances Valid in part If an ordinance con sists of several distinct and independent parts although one or more of them are void the rest are eqaally valid as though the void clauses had been omitted but when the valid part is so connected with and dependent on that which is void as that the parts are not distinctly separable so that each can stand alone as the will of the law making body the whole must fall The opinion states the case R W Arnold for the plaintiff George S Bernard for the defendant HON J F WEST J This is an action brought by the plaintiff against the defendant company to recover damages for the alleged negligent killing of the plaintiffs cow STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS IN THE CASE Plaintiffs cow was killed by the defendant companys engine near the companys depot in the town of Wakefield Sussex county Virginia on September 8 1903 The engineer in charge of the train did all he could do having a due regard for the duty which he owed the passengers on his train to stop his train and prevent an injury to defendants cow The plaintiff resided outside of the town of Wakefield in Wakefield Magisterial District where the fence law was in force that is where the land owners are re quired to fence in their open lands and are permitted to let their stock run at large The town of Wakefield is also located in Wakefield Magisterial District At the time the cow was killed it was the habit of the defendant company to leave hay and grain  Reported by C B Garnett1905 MURPHY V NORFOLK  WESTERN RY CO 125 scattered about the sidetrack at the point at which the cow was killed and at other places about the depot The grain and hay were scattered there by different people who bought in carload lots whilst unloading the cars It was a custom of the company to clean up around the depot about once a week but cattle and hogs were frequently attracted to this place by the hay and grain which were scattered upon and permitted to remain upon the premises Othe stock had been killed about the same spot At the time the cow was killed there was in force in the town of Wakefield an ordinance adopted May 12 1903 regulating the running at large of stock within the corporate limits of said town which ordinance was in the following words and figures towit First Be it ordained by the Council of the town of Wakefield that if any horse sheep goat cow or hog be found running at large within the corporate limits of said town the owner thereof shall pay a fine of not more than 100 one dollar for each of fense and it shall be the duty of the sergeant of said town to im pound such horse sheep goat cow or hog and he shall be allowed fifty cents for his services in each case and twentyfive cents per day for feeding such horse sheep goat cow or hog so impounded which amount shall be assessed and collected from the owner of such animal And if the owner of any such animal so impounded shall fail to reclaim the same and pay such fine and charges with in twentyfour hours the sergeant shall after duly advertising the time and place of sale for five days sell such animal by public auction and pay such fine costs and charges This ordinance ap plies to all stock owned by persons living in the town of Wakefield Second Be it ordained by the Council of the town of Wake field that if any bull or boar be found running at large within the corporate limits of said town the owner thereof shall pay a fine of not more than one dollar 100 for each offense and it shall be the duty of the sergeant of said town to impound such bull or boar and he shall be allowed fifty cents for his services in each case and twentyfive cents per day for feeding such bull or boar so impounded which amount shall be assessed and collected from the owner of such animal And if the owner of such animal so impounded shall fail to reclaim the same and pay such fine and charges within twentyfour hours the sergeant shall after duly advertising the time and place of sale for five days sell such ani mal by public auction and pay such fire costs and charges This126 11 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER June ordinance applies to the above described stock owned by persons living outside of the corporate limits of the town of Wakefield The plaintiff contends that the defendant is liable for the value of the cow for the reasons that the defendant negligently per mitted hay and corn to remain scattered upon its depot premises by means whereof the defendants cow was attracted there and killed The defendant claims that there was no negligence in leaving hay or corn on or near the track at the place at which the cow was struck by defendants engine and that if the defendant was negligent in that respect the plaintiff was doing an illegal act which contributed to the injury sustained by him and therefore cannot recover It is negligence in a railroad company to allow hay or other food for live stock to remain on its depot premises an unreasonable lenlgth of time in places where it is likely to attract stock running at large The law governing such cases is stated in section 1211 on page 1868 vol 2 Elliott on Railroads as follows When an animal has been attracted by an article which has been scattered over and about the track during the process of loading or unloading and is allowed to remain there the company may sometimes be liable Thus where salt in being unloaded was scattered over the track and allowed to remain there the com pany was held liable for injuries to an animal which had been at tracted to the place by the salt And the company was held liable under similar circumnstances where cotton seed had been allowed to accumulate on the track See also Schooling v St Louis etc R Co 75 Mo 518 Crafton v Hannibal etc R Co 55 AiMo 580 LUttle Rock etc R Co v Dick t2 Ark 402 Page v North Carolina R Co 71 N C 222 The preponderance of the evidence in this case shows that the defendant had permitted hay to be scattered upon and to negli gently remain upon the depot premises at Wakefield and that the plaintiffs cow was attracted there by it and killed The plaintiff is therefore entitled to recover unless as claimed by the defend ants counsel the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence Was the plaintiff guilty of such contributory negligence The answer to this question involves the construction of the ordinance of the town of Wakefield supra adopted May 12 1903 Had the1905 MURPHY V NORFOLK  WESTERN RY CO 127 plaintiff been a resident of said town it would be unnecessary ac cording to the defendants view of the case to consider the mean ing and effect of said ordinance But the last sentence of section 1 of the ordinance which makes it unlawful to allow cows and other live stock named therein to run at large within the cor porate limits of the town of Wakefield reads as follows This ordiance applies to all stock owned by people living in the town of Wakefield And the last sentence of section 2 of the ordinance the section which relates to bulls and boars reads as fol lows This ordinance applies to the above described stock owned by persons living outside of the corporate limits of Wakefield It is said by Judge Dillon in 1 Dillon on Municipal Corpora tion section 322 As it would be unreasonable and unjust to make  an act done by one person penal and if done by another not so ordinances which have this effect cannot be sus tained  The powers vested in municipal corporations should as far as practicable be exercised by ordinances general in their nature and impartial in their operation iolt C J speaking for the court in Simrall v Covington 90 Ky 44 says Perhaps the most distinguishing feature of the common law is its regard for the protection and equality of indi vidual rights It is a rule therefore that when the bylaws of a municipality enacted under a general grant of power or by virtue of its incidental authority is unfair and partial in its operation it will be declared void A bylaw to be reasonable should be in harmony with the general principles of the common law See Cooley on Constitutional Limitations pages 200 and 202 It is plain therefore that the ordinance of May 12 1903 when construed as a whole and accordingy as allowing the stock of nonresidents bulls and boars excepted to run at large within the corporate limits of the town whilst forbidding the running at large of the stock of residents of the town bulls and boars ex cepted is unreasonable and neither general in its nature nor impartial in its operation and therefore void And upon such construction of said ordinance the contention of the defendant that the plaintiff was doing an illegal act which contributed to the injury sustained by him must be overruled But it is earnestly and ably contended by the distinguished counsel for the defendant that under the rule of law that An ordinance like a statute may be valid in part and void as to the128 11 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER June residue the court should strike out the last sentence of each sec tion of the ordinance the sentence above quoted in each section that makes the ordinance unreasonable and partial in its opera tion and construe the residue of the ordinance as though these objectionable parts had no existence with the result that the ordi nance so construed would apply to cows owned by persons re siding outside of the town of Wakefield The rule is that if a bylaw consists of several distinct and in dependent parts although one or more of them may be void the rest are equally valid as though the void clauses had been omitted M  0 R R Co v State 29 Ala 573 There have been several cases in Virginia where statutes have been held valid in part and void in part Carter v Common wealth 96 Va 791 and Trimble v Commonwealth 96 Va 818 The rule of construction as to statutes and ordinances is the same in this respect When the valid part is so connected with and dependent on that which is void as that the parts are not distinctly separable so that each can stand alone as the will of the lawmaking body the whole must fall Black v Trower 79 Va 129 and authorities cited In passing the ordinance in question it was the evident purpose of the council of the town of Wakefield not to prohibit the cows owned by nonresidents of said town from going at large within the corporate limits of said town To hold in accordance with the view which has been urged by the defendant that the ordinance is valid in part and void in part would be in effect not only to make a new ordinance but one which it cannot be assumed that the coun cil of said town would have been willing to make This the court has no right to do and the question of new legislation must be left to the council of said town The court is therefore of the opinion that the entire ordinance is inoperative and void and doth so adjudge and that the plaintiff was not doing an illegal act which contributed to the injurv sus tained by him when he knowingly permitted his cow to go at large in the corporate limits of the town of Wakefield It follows necessarily that the plaintiff is entitled to recover of the defendant the value of his cow which the court adjudges to be 30 WVhere upon it is considered by the court that the plaintiff recover of the defendant the said sum of 30 and his costs by him in this behalf expended

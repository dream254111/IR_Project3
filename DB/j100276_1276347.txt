j100276,Michigan Law Review,1276347,The New Law of Nations,i254511,THE NEW LAW OF NATIONS FOREWORD IF THE article upon THE NEW LAW OF NATIONS had been writ ten by an obscure man for a sensational periodical it would not have been worthy of serious consideration It appeared in September I915 however in the ZEITSCHRIFT FUR V6LKERRECHT generally reputed to be the leading periodical devoted to international law published in the German language Its author Dr JOSEF KOHLER is generally conceded to be the most distinguished living German jurist His PHILOSOPHY OF LAW was deemed worthy of translation into English and appeared as Volume 12 of the Modern Legal Philosophy Series Dean RoscoE POUND has referred to him as the first of living jurists No one else he says has come so near to taking all legal knowledge for his province No one there fore is so well prepared to reduce all legal knowledge to a system Professor KOHLER was born at Offenburg Baden March 9 I849 and was educated at Freiburg and Heidelberg He was Professor of Jurisprudence at the University of Wiirzburg from 1878 to I888 when he was appointed to a professorship in the University of Berlin a chair which he still holds He is also a Privy Councillor Dr KOIlLERS contributions to law and jurisprudence have been enormous in bulk and in range He has published much in the field of patent and copyright law as well as in jurisprudence and legal philosophy His versatility is remarkable for his writings are not confined to law and jurisprudence but he has made excursions into the fields of aesthetics poetry and musical composition The following article at first sight appears most striking because of the virulence of the animadversions upon everything nonGerman In this respect KOHLER has only done what many other distinguished German Gelehrten have allowed themselves to do since the outbreak of the present war notably LASSON HARNACK HAECKEL as well as ninetyodd other German professors who signed a remarkable manifesto soon after the outbreak of the war In some fields of intel lectual activity such an absence of objectivity might be pardoned less pardonable is it in the field of international law This was rec ognized by KOHLERS collaborator Dr HANS WEHBERG of Diissel dorf whose monograph upon THE LAW OF CAPTURE ON LAND AND I Boston Book Company I914 2The Scope and Purpose of Sociological Jurisprudence 155 seq quoted in the editorial preface to the Philosophy of Law xvxviMICHIGAN LAW REVIEIV AT SEA is distinguished by breadth of view and conservatism of state ment Dr WVHBERG discontinued his association with KOHLERS ZEITSCHRIRT in a letter printed in the BERLINER TAGEBLATT Sep tember 24 I9155 To those who would insist that KOHLER repre sents completely the German attitude toward international law the statements of Dr WEHBE1RG may be opposed If all that KOHLER has said was true Dr WEHBRG wrote he should have gone to the limit and drawn the conclusion that an international law is no longer possible and that a review of international law has no longer any right to exist If however he issues a review of inter national law he must in that case take preliminary measures in this review for the purpose of effecting an understanding with other nations with reference to questions upon which different points of view may be entertained Such a review must not hold up neutral nations to public scorn and thus offending them claim the right to assert that outside of the German science of international law there is no other such science in the true sense KOHLER expresses this last idea with even greater emphasis when he flatly denies to other nations the capacity of systematic juridical thinking    Whoever is well acquainted with scientific research and the peculiar essence of international law will no doubt comprehend my viewpoint and respect it In the great crisis by which all mankind was con fronted through the outbreak of the war it became the sacred duty of all learned men at least within the field of science to pay just and impartial tribute even to other nations and to uphold faith in a better future for humanity KOHLERS tirade against all nonGerman peoples might be con sidered merely as a disfigurement of his article A closer examina tion however of his attitude strengthens the conclusion that it is the natural byproduct of his general philosophical position One of the first to recognize the value of the science of comparative law was not a jurist but a philosopher whose like since HEGEL the world has not seenNIETTZSCH Again he says The Philosophy of Law as indeed philosophy in general has recently been much furthered thanks to the great mind of NIETZSCHE wlho subjected the prime cultural questions anew to searching thought and estab lished some of them on a new basis4 The general scheme of neo Hegelian and Nietzschian philosophy as applied to international law may be seen in his treatise on the PHILOSOPHY OF LAW especially in Chapter I45 Therein he suggests the doctrine of the superstate 3 A translation of this letter was printed in the American Journal of International Law for October i9I pp 925927 4 Philosophy of Law II 27 5 Pp 294307 632THE NEW LAW OF NATIONS with supernational law taking the place of international law al though he admits that supernational law without the support of a superstate cannot of course be true legislation but it can be law that develops in legal custom it can be customary law The logical conclusion of Dr KOHLRS article is the nega tion of international law That the international law of the future will be based upon the traditional primordial rights of states may well be doubted Modern international society cannot be organized upon the few fundamental or primordial rights of states sover eignty independence and equality which have their counterpart in municipal law in the natural rights of individuals as developed in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries All law is a social prod uct and the realization of juristic ideals in positive law is possible only by what KOHLER calls the general cultural process or as we should say by the general advance of civilization To that extent one may agree with the general Hegelian doctrine of law develop ment The difficulty is that as yet world society has developed through the interplay of those units of world society which we think of as states and the basis of international law is the concept that the general furtherance of world civilization rests upon a system of law which recognizes these units sets up for them standards of legal capacity and exacts from them measures of legal duty These standards are and have been subject to change The emphasis of eighteenth century international law was upon the fundamental rights of states This doctrine has been revamped to an extraordi nary degree by the recent declaration of the American Institute of International Law upon the rights and duties of states Modern international society however tends to stress international duties The present world war is in many respects a world protest against the denial by the German Empire of the foremost of international duties namely the duty to fulfill treaty obligations To hold that the treaty by which Belgium was neutralized was a scrap of paper and to act accordingly is justified by KOHLERS conception of in ternational law which fits in with the doctrine of necessity It was a repudiation of international law Were the doctrine vic torious world society could not exist save under a world empire University of Michigan J S REEvEs TRANSLATORS NOTEI am well aware that the translation of Kultur by culture may be criticized Kultur is an eauivalent neither of culture nor of civilization Their antithesis was well illustrated by a statement made by Professor Karl Lamprecht in a public address made in I904 at the St Louis Worlds Congress of Arts and Sciences He then said Anerika hat eine hohe Zivilization aber eine geringe Kultur The remark does not appear in the address as published but was noted at the time by me It showed that at least in Professor Lamprechts mind Kultur did not preclude hasty generalization or necessarily include tact and courtesyJ S R 633MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW THE NEW LAW OF NATIONS HGco GROTIUS founded the Law of Nations upon the Jus Na turae for his historical citations are for the most part fables and rococo ornament which have nothing to do with the argument PUFENDORF and WOLFF enlarged the Law of Nature for interna tional commerce and the compatriot of HUGO DE GROOT BYNKER SHOEK added many important features The barocque fashion of the era following lost itself within the tortuous mazes of diplomatic etiquette and found therein a matter of huge importance But from then on there gradually appeared an historical attitude which sought to substitute a deeper meaning for the pseudoscience The historical development of maritime law after the Consolato del Mare and especially after the Peace of Utrecht was more closely investigated and a new wealth of knowledge based on apposite historical inci dent was brought into the science Just as in the scattered and un systematic notices of PLATO and ARISTOTLE lay the germ of the future science of comparative jurisprudence so the historical meth od was foreshadowed by the many citations of GROTIUS It was however HEGEL who first taught us to know history as the embodiment of juristic reason and the historical spirit came to animate the science Its importance will never be forgotten not that we are to be riveted to the past but because we can know the present only in the light of the past as the product of a great cul tural process From this product we must begin for to this extent the actual is also the rational Some decades ago another element came into International Law Since the armed neutrality of KATHERINE II even more since the Vienna Congress and especially since the Declaration of Paris in ternational treaties have come to be emphasized as a creative element of juristic norms and in The Hague Peace Conferences this point of view celebrated its apparent victory It was thought that the goal had been reached a new international community which em braced all states The belief became steadily stronger that now the angel of peace had spread its broad wings that international arbitra tion and conciliation had reunited erstwhile quarreling brothers and if War as an atavistic reminiscence should indeed occur it would be but a duel hedged about by many rules at which the rest of the nations stood watch as seconds in order to assure the punctilious ob servance of all its conventionalities War like the duel was bound gradually to disappear Meanwhile the members of the family of nations decided to conduct themselves as brothers do when they 634THE NEW LAW OF NATIONS disagree It was assumed that they could not behave so very badly and that at the worst strife would soon softly expire in the bosom of universal peace This phantasmagoria of a family of nations which would dictate the norms of International Law and by judicial methods decide in ternational disputes so that only exceptionally and here and there the structure of the international community would be convulsed by Warall that is far behind us Twelve months only have passed but they divide us from all that has gone before as if years had intervened The occurrences of the past year have accomplished more than decades The Hague Peace Conferences were dreams of peace which have burst like bubbles and the Peace Palace at The HIague can appropriately open its halls for other praiseworthy aims of mankind We also were enthralled by these illusions and we are frank enough to confess it if we are rebuked for being unpractical and shortsighted for doing so that it was our honorable German nature which permitted us to overlook cunning and wickedness it was our belief in mankind which led us and the thought that at least a spark of our German idealism was to be found among other peoples We fully believed that we had to do with civilized peoples who like us were constantly striving to solve the greatest problems of human ity We assumed that every nation had its own task in the further ance of culture We believed that the world was big enough so that all nations in furthering their own interests would by straightfor ward intercourse increase the spiritual assets of the entire world This illusion was a huge deception of race psychology but it was the deception of a man of honor who falls into the grip of a cunning band such an error honors him who errs and loyalty to a mistaken morality raises him who is thus deceived gianthigh above the reptile which crawls about him Then we became clearvisioned The German SIEGFRIED who has never learned to know fear is awakened at the right moment Just as SIEMGRIED once understood the speech of birds so now we recog nize in the buzzing and tumult of the worldstrife the true soul of our opponents and the dragon of cunning lies and slander is stretched beneath our victorious sword The noble myth of our people has become a reality An International Law based on international treaties can no longer be International association can only lead to norms of law if the peoples are actuated by legal endeavors Treaties with liars and falsifiers cannot form sources of law only those peoples can co operate in the development of law who have a living conscience 635MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW Shall we recognize as brother nations having kindred conceptions of justice those like the Frencha nation of bragging tricksters who drench us with most miserable abuse and outrageous slanderor a perfidious company of peddlers like the English who from the first day of the war have flooded the world with statements which they knew to be calumnies and liesa nation whose government did not hesitate like bandits following the fashion of CAESAR BORGIA to undertake sneaking bribery in order to get rid of a ROGER CASE MENT Or a nation of barbarians like the Russians whose excesses in East Prussia have suddenly brought before our eyes the whole Muscovite brutality Or the Italians among whom a miserable lot teryplaying group made up of the immature and halfeducated proletariat and of phrasedrunken demagogues could bring the gov ernment to violate sacred treaties and to fall upon the flank of their sworn allies No and thrice No These ties are forever broken And as for neutrals the United States glorying in an empty play of moral platitudes with the blessing of the VANDERBILTMORGAN mil lions has done enough injury to us with its munitions policy Neu tral states like Spain Switzerland and Sweden will always appear to us dear and worthy On the other hand a portion of the press of Holland Norway and Denmark has wounded us sorely by its unjust treatment of us And Holland has persuaded herself by putting her trade under English control to further Englands war of starvation In all these circumstances these peoples can never be bound with us into an Areopagus wherein every state works with even justice in order to lay down for the world the statutes of the Law of Nations In what fashion are to be shaped the relations of the great sources of culture for humanity the relations of Germany in union with Austria which draws within our circle of culture the highly gifted Hungarians and an important group of Slavs and in alliance with Turkey as the powerful fortress of Islamic culturethat is not now a subject for discussion But we are indeed clearsighted enough to form a correct estimate of the past The look into the future is denied us and to make guesses is fruitless and dangerous We can however speak with confidence as to the future of In ternational Law and here we must be guided back into the path of HUGO GROTITS Just as he depended upon the Law of Nature so ought we But for us the Law of Nature is not an eternal inflexible changeless thing It is for us the historical Idea controlling culture This Idea is a rational one and is therefore to be developed as a logical one Because if an illogical element now and then enters 636THE NEW LAWV OF NATIONS in it becomes engrafted upon the system of the science Of course International Law is not a conceptual science in the sense of a speculation wholly divorced from actualities which we wish to en throne but a science which draws its guiding principles from the observation of life and its rational cultureaims forms them into conceptions and out of the conceptions constructs the particulars of law This is German science for German science alone has been able to work in systematic fashion How incapable of this other peoples are may be shown by a single illustration The French who are yet far beyond the English did not succeed in creating a system of the CODE NAPOLEON So that in their incapacity they were com pelled to lay down as a basis the system of a German ZACHARIA wherein they have attempted to escape from their antiquated com mentary If we are to frame the International Law of Peace and the International Law of War we must fix our eyes upon the aims and efforts of culture We must test the means which may be suitable we must make the best choice and in this we must of course consult the expert Science acts here as a legislator If it were a question of the efforts of Peace something let us say about traffic over roads and rivers we should decide that those regulations are the best which direct traffic upon the best road No reasonable man can possibly doubt that the great trade streams must be common to all peoples and so must be the use of the atmosphere The law of the air is to be developed and constructed in this manner and quite without international legal agreements As to that which concerns War there are three controlling principles OneWar is waged not between peoples but between states so that only the organs of the state may be concerned in it twoWar may destroy but the destruction must be sanctified by its aim it may only be carried on so as to overcome the enemy without unnecessary injuries and suf fering and threeWar should not bring about a lawless condi tion of the civil population but a governmental organization for the occupied territory should be effected as quickly as possible All of these ideas are so extremely fruitful that out of them a complete Law of War might be developed For example the whole Geneva Red Cross Convention is but an emanation of the second of these statements So also is the provision as to prisoners of war so also the further provision as to reprisals and hostages requisitions and contributions Execution of details follows almost everywhere auto matically Whether we designate the sanitary corps with the Ge neva Cross or as the Turks do with the Crescent is one of the many small details in execution which cannot disturb the unity of the fundamental idea 637MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW Hence it appears that International Law has to work for the most part with logical constructions from fundamental principles So far as particular practices are concerned their importance is not to be exaggerated They are at any rate valuable as examples of practice which is often striving after rational expression but a greater significance they do not have If peoples like the English and the Americans merely follow their particular practices because they are not logically constructive they must forego taking part in the development of the science and confine themselves to the fetch ing of materials At this rebuilding of International Law upon historical founda tions with a logically constructed plan motivated from the culture world we have to work It is a great elevating and fruitful en deavor The future will demonstrate the ever increasing impor tance of this constructive International Law The claim is often made that there is no International Law because it is trampled under foot by our enemies This is as erroneous as it would be to assert that there is no municipal law because at the present time one might be liable to be robbed by the banditti of the Italian Abruzzi or as saulted by Parisian apaches or by the Milanese rabble Naturally International Law needs its sanction just as every branch of law does but we shall as I hope be so vastly fortified by our victorious war that we can undertake the protection of International Law just as centuries ago the Lombard DANTE invoked the German Em peror as the protector of law and the shield of justice JOSEPH KOHLER Privy Councillor and Professor in the University of Berlin 638

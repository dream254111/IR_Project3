view either to prolong the life of the wood by rendering it as resistant as possible to de cay or to make it resistant to the attack of fire and to cause it when exposed to flame to carbonize as slowly as possible without of or from itself contributing to the in crease of the flame We will take up the second of these two lines of treatment for present discussion The treatment of wood with a view of making it fireresistant is not a matter of  The use of the curve of progress some times finds curious and unexpected application The study of the curve of progress of the speed of the horse was years ago attempted by this method and it was found by the author of this address that the twominute horse might be expected at about the commencement of the twentieth century Several periods of smooth progress broken catastrophically by improve ments or by inventions were observed as when the fourwheeled wagon was superseded by the sulky and when the pneumatic tire was intro duced In each curve the trend has at the break become approximately asymptotic The horse had nearly reached his limit and the reduction of load was the only recourse in further promotion of progressSci American Supplement December 1 894 t Read before Section C of the American Asso ciation for the Advancement of Science Pitts burgh meeting June 1902SEPTEMBER 12 1902 recent years The Bavarian chemist Fuchs in 1820 applied the newly discovered sili cate of soda to the fireproofing of wood and employed it in the rebuilding of the Munich theater for the treatment of both the wood work and the hangings of the theater Gay Lussac in 1821 suggested the salts of ammo nia and borax Tungstate of soda also figured at an early day in the list of fire proofing salts as well as the salts of zinc and the chlorides of the alkalies and cal cium and magnesium Antedating all of these however going back indeed to the records of ancient Greece and Rome was alum which has always been a favorite fire proofing material used both alone and in admixture with other compounds All of these materials can under circum stances exert a notable fireretarding effect and have served as the basis of a variety of patented processes for the treatment of wood But we must not lose sight of the fact that the problem of satisfactorily impreg nating wood for fireproofing purposes is a mechanical as well as chemical one and it will be best to look at the mechanical side of it for a few moments The typical ap paratus until recently employed every where wherewith to saturate lumber with fireproofing solutions was a large cylinder running from 60 in diameter and 70 to 80 ft long to 84 in diameter and 105 ft long closed at one end with a movable head at the other swinging horizontally or lifting vertically to open or close It was fastened when closed by a complicated system of radial bolts to the external end of the cyl inder The cylinder itself composed of steel plates riveted together was intended to be filled with truck loads of lumber and when the entrance door was closed and lock ed the wood was subjected after some pre liminary treatment to hydraulic pressure through the medium of the treating solu tion which envelopes the surface of each piece of lumber and which the pressure was intended to force into it at every point With cylinders of such enormous diam eters and riveted plates the pressure that can be withstood is relatively light and as a consequence the time of saturation is necessarily long The preliminary treatment before re ferred to is usually a steaming of the wood followed by application of a vacuum for the purpose of facilitating the final step o  im pregnation A pressure of 150 lbs is quite as much as can be maintained as an aver age in such a cylinder and to effect a com plete saturation even with soft woods one inch thick requires in such a case from 36 to 40 hours A core saturation in heavier timbers such as 4 x 4 in or 6 x 6 in is rare ly if ever obtained even in soft woods and never in the hard woods A radical improvement upon this meth od of working was effected by Mr Jos L Ferrell of Philadelphia in the invention of the apparatus now in use by the U S Fireproof Wood Co of Philadelphia and which was described andf figured in the Scientific American of July 28 1900 By the replacement of the hinged gate by a heavy gate sliding between vertical guides against a phosphorbronze bearing and placed in a massive gate housing near the end of the cylinder which is of heavy cast tubing he was able to use pressures rang ing from 400 to 1500 pounds in extreme cases By the intervention of a hydraulic accumulator he was able to perfectly cush ion the shock of the highpressure pumps so as to prevent all bruising of the wood when under strong pressure No prelimin ary steaming or vacuum is necessary but after the receiver is full of liquid and the pressure is applied the liquid penetrates and in what seems an incredibly short space of time has followed the medullary rays from end to end of the lumber and ef fected what is bound to be a thorough core SCIENCE 428N S VOL XVI No 402 saturation One hundred per cent satura tion weighed wet is readily effected in ten minutes and after the kiln drying the permanent gain in the weight of the wood will be found to be from 5 to 10 per cent distributed throughout its whole cellular structure and not on the surface or in the exterior layers only Hard woods in large sizes up to 12 by 12 in have been so treated and upon being sawed through have been found to have perfect heart saturation With the mechanical side of the fire proofing treatment thus perfected let us turn again to the choice of a chemical which shall prove as fireresistant as possible and impart this quality to the wood Some of the qualities that such a chemical should possess may be briefly reviewed 1 It must not be of a hydroscopic na ture because in such case it would destroy paint and keep the surface of the wood in an undesirable moist condition For this reason the chlorides of calcium magnesium and zinc are excluded although an attempt has been recently made in a German patent to produce for this purpose a basic chloride of calcium which it is claimed is free from this drawback and is recommended for fire proofing of wood 2 It must not be a volatile substance because in such case it will gradually be liberated from the cells of the wood and show as an efflorescence besides leaving the wood after a time weaker in its fire resist ant character The ammonia salts notably the sulphate and chloride will not stand this test at all satisfactorily In the dry kiln the liberation of ammoniacal gas be gins already at 125 F and the efflorescence is frequently recognizable even when the surface has been varnished if the wood has been exposed to strong sunshine for any length of time Of course such efflores cence speedily ruins the appearance of a varnished wood 3 The chemical used must not allow of fungus growth for in such case the wood will decay more rapidly than untreated wood Here again the ammonia salts in cluding the phosphate as well as sulphate are unsatisfactory as when the conditions of warmth and moisture are favorable the treated wood develops a fungus rapidly and deteriorates in strength 4 If possible the chemical should have exactly the opposite character viz a dis tinct preservative effect so that the life of the treated wood should exceed that of untreated wood 5 There should be no noxious gas liber ated in the heating or carbonizing of the wood 6 The chemical used must not be poison ous in character so that splinters impreg nated with it if by accident run into the flesh or wounding it shall not endanger life or health 7 It should not cause the corrosion or rusting of metal which in the form of screws or bolts are passed through it 8 The cost must be moderate as its practical utilization will be barred if the materials be such as to make the process an expensive one After a most exhaustive series of experi ments extending over several years with a wide range of compounds Mr Ferrell the inventor of the fireproofing method just referred to has found in sulphate of alum ina a compound that appears to answer all the requirements as stated It has the ad ditional feature of no slight importance in its bearing upon the fireproofing effect that when strongly heated it leaves an infusible and nonconducting residue to cover and protect the cellular structure throughout the wood It absolutely prevents the pro pagation not only of flame throughout the wood but even of a glow because of its non conducting and unalterable character Sulphate of alumina in concentrated 426 SCIENCESEPTEMBER 12 1902 solution is far more efficient than an alum solution in fact it would seem as if the alkaline sulphate of the alum simply de tracted from the power of the aluminum sulphate in the matter of making wood fire resistant I have before referred to the way in which sulphate or phosphate of ammonia act to make wood fireresistant viz by rapidly liberating ammonia gas which has the effect of checking the flames on the sur face of the wood The fiercer the flame which plays against such wood the more rapid the liberation and exhaustion of the protecting vapor There is no residual protective substance remaining in the wood and the carbonization of the fiber proceeds apace On the other hand so soon as the sulphate of alumina of the superficial layer of the wood impregnated with this chemical is decomposed by the heat of a flame a depos it of alumina is formed the nonconducting properties of which make it a barrier against the propagation of the carbonizing effect and protect the interior in a very no table degree An actual experiment one of a large number which I carried out joint ly with the inventor will illustrate this If a piece of wood be saturated with a solu tion of sulphate of alumina of 30 B strength to a depth of not more than three eighth inch from the surface and the point of the inner blue cone of a strong Bunsen flame be made to impinge upon it and kept in such a position a boring effect takes place while an abundant separation of alumina will be observed The average re sistance of a piece of oneinch white pine so treated to the complete boring result with final penetration of the flame to the other side will be over three hours If a similar piece of oneinch white pine be heartsaturated with ten times the quan tity of sulphate of ammonia and the same Bunsen flame be applied under exactly similar conditions the average resistance to complete penetration will not be over seventy minutes These results have been obtained repeatedly and in instances the disproportion was much greater Some very interesting observations have been made on the physical changes which the fireproofing material undergoes on the continued application of heat As a result of repeated measurements it is found that the residual alumina occupies a space from two and a half to three times as great as the dried salt from which it is formed Hence in forming it apparently expands to fill out the air spaces and intercellular spaces of the wood very fully This results in the formation of a very compact nonconduct ing barrier which interposes itself to the action of the flame and protects the layers of woody tissue upon which it is formed The protection is therefore a real and much more lasting one than that which could come from the liberation of a gas whose ac tion from the nature of things could be evanescent only In working on a large scale where heavy timbers or boards in the rough are treated the saturation with the sulphate of alum ina solution is always carried out until complete heart saturation is attained as the wood has to be sawed planed mortised and otherwise worked and cut into and all surfaces that will be exposed later must be fireresistant to the fullest degree As irrespective of the large number of both soft and hard woods that because of their practical value had to be tested the same kind of wood will differ greatly in its physical characters according as it may be heartwood or sapwood and according as it may be young wood or thoroughly ma tured a vast number of saturation tests have been made in establishing the effi ciency of the different methods of working and the value of different solutions No deduction has been thought to be of value SCIENCE 427N S VOL XVI No 402 that was not based upon a large number of tests carried out under similar conditions so as to obtain an average that could be relied on The immensity of the task may be un derstood when it is stated that 88000 sat urations and fire tests with complete attend ing records have been made of different thicknesses of 19 different varieties of wood and 46 chemical formulae requiring the con stant application of the inventor and his assistants and running through a period of over six years One remaining question and a very im portant one is what effect has the fire proofing treatment upon the structural strength of the wood When the older methods of saturation whereby the wood was steamed and then subjected to pressure for long periods was the only one available it was recognized that a compression of the cellular structure of the exterior layers of the wood took place so that the wood was distinctly weakened and the results for tensile strength and bending and break ing tests were accepted as necessarily lower than for the same wood untreated With the superior method of impregnation now adopted however no such allowance is necessary and the treated wood is in no way inferior in strength to the untreated Pro fessors Mason and Bliss of the University of New York have made a large number of physical tests upon the wood treated by the Perrell process and have established this important fact very fully The whole mat ter however of the fireresistant properties of wood treated by different processes to gether with physical tests upon the same is now under investigation by a Commission appointed by the Bureau of Building Con struction of the City of New York and I have no doubt that its report when pub lished will throw much additional light upon this most important subject SAMUEL P SADTLER PHILADELPHIA July 1902 AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE

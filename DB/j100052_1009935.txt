j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1009935,Fire Insurance Rates and Methods,i242558,FIRE INSURANCE RATES AND METHODS In the spring of 1902 the price of fire insurance throughout this country suddenly rose 25 per cent During the ensuing hub bub the fire insurance companies furnished ingenious explanations and waited for the storm to blow over For the remaining months of I902 alone this increased charge for insurance produced about sixteen million dollars more income to the companies This sudden rise in the price of fire insurance was due to the application by the companies of the old principle of charging all that the traffic will bear Evidences of commercial prosperity displayed on all sides could not but excite the cupidity of corpora tions manifestly in business for the benefit of their exchequer A conclave of primemovers in the insurance world was held at which the formula was adopted that the insurance companies for years having lost much money it is imperatively necessary to raise rates 25 per cent and said raise goes into effect immediately No esoteric meaning attached to the words we are losig money They were explained as meaning that the profits realized from the employment of capital in the fire insurance business were inadequate to keep that capital from flowing to other more remunerative indus tries What are the facts of the case  From the tables presented at the annual meeting of the National Board of Fire Underwriters on Mav 14 1903 it is found that the paid dividends of the American jointstock fire insurance com panies combined have averaged from I860 to 1902 inclusive not less than III4 per cent Since 1892 the yearly averages have been as follows Year Per ct Year Per ct 1892  Io5I 1898  I64 1893  043 1899  I 65 1894  io6o0 900  I I8 1895  1 40 190I  I 63 I896  I124 1902  1 96 1897  I133 So that the average dividends of the last eight years have been higher than the average of the last fortytwo years and the divi dends declared in 1902 were the largest since i860 413The Annals of the American Academy Turning to the market price of fire insurance companies stocks the investigator is confronted with symptoms of decided prosperity The Insurance Year Book for 1903 published by the Spectator Company New York on pages I80 to I87 quotes the latest sale of stock per cent of 139 American fire insurance companies These selling prices fall into the following subdivisions Ioo Stock selling below oo  Stock selling at 101I50  65 Stock selling at 151200  25 Stock selling at 20I300   23 Stock selling at 301400   13 Stock selling at 40I1400  12 139 Can anything be discovered in these prices warranting dis appointment or pessimism It should be remembered that the income of the fire insurance companies is derived mainly from two sources underwriting and investment of funds So that dividends on capital invested are declared out of the profits accruing either primarily from the under writing or secondarily from the investment of funds An under writing loss arises when the indemnity paid out for loss by fire and the expenses of management together exceed the income derived from premiums for the indemnity furnished The alleged total underwriting loss of all American com panies in I9OI is an elusive quantity but the insurance companies seem to have agreed to give it as considerably over six million dollars For arguments sake we might assume that this statement is truthful It would then follow that the dividends declared by these companies in I9OI arose from profits derived from the sec ondary sources of income after making good the alleged under writing loss of 6oooooo In other words if the primary source of income showed a debit of 6oooooo so that a dividend of II63 per cent was declared out of profits derived from the secondary sources of income it is obvious that but for this debit of 6oo00 ooo total dividends of 2254 per cent could have been paid on the capital of 55000000 Either one of two things follows when telling the public we are losing money the fire insurance com panies really meant we are losing money on one of our sources 414 2Fire Insurance Rates and Methods of income though from our secondary sources of income we are making very much money or else they were distributing unearned dividends That they were guilty of this illegal act is not probable So far then it seems that there was but little reason if any for increasing the fire insurance burdens of this country 25 per cent The business of fire insurance in this country is not only highly profitable but is profitable in spite of an extravagance and a waste of money which in any other industry could not be tolerated The combined American and foreign jointstock fire insurance companies doing business in the United States entered into contracts for con tingent indemnity or to use the technical phrase wrote the follow ing aggregate amount of risks In 902  21320333036 In I900  9130399000 An increase of  2189934036 or II2 They paid out for commissions and brokerage In 902  37628785 In 900o  29705775 An increase of   7923010 or 26 23 In other words in order to increase sales of indemnity by II12 per cent the companies actually increased the commissions paid to their agents by 26 23 per cent Any competitive industry which treated its traveling repre sentatives or sales agents similarly would be guilty of foolishness or excessive generosity and in either case would be inviting bank ruptcy The peculiar extravagance of this method of doing busi ness is more apparent when consideration is given to the following figures The consideration or price or technically speaking the premiums charged for writing the foregoing risks was In 1902  85494632 In I  46263565 An increase of    3923I067 So that out of an increased income of about thirtynine millions eight millions went to brokers In other words over 20 per cent of the increase of money arbitrarily taken from the public went 415 3The Annals of the American Academy immediately into the pockets of insurance brokers This it should be remembered happened at the very time when the public all over the country was being told that the companies were losing so much money that there was nothing left to do but to raise the price of insurance 25 per cent This immense drain for commissions made upon the whole business community is not only excessive and unreasonable but it is a condition of affairs which has been steadily growing worse for the last forty years In fact for every policy or contract promising indemnity to the amount of Ioo there was paid as commissions and brokerage the following sums In the years 186070 an average of  105 cents In the years 187180 an average of  I39 cents In the years I88190 an average of  I56 cents In the years I89II900 an average of  158 cents In the year I9OI an average of  I66 cents In the year 1902 an average of  I77 cents It will be seen that the payment to the insurance broker has steadily and persistently grown until it is today greater than at any time since I860 and this in spite of the fact that the public is much more desirous of insurance and more than ever accustomed to assume the duties which should really be fulfilled by the broker So farthenit is found that dividends paid on the capital invested in the fire insurance business and the commissions paid to agents are higher today than at any time during the last fortytwo years Now it will be admitted that the prime function of fire insurance is to indemnify the public against loss by fire We have seen that in I902 all the United States companies combined made the follow ing payments For commissions and brokerage  26548587 For dividends  6554570 Total  33I03I57 These thirtythree millions of course came out of the pockets of the insured Besides the 33000000 above accounted for there were other expenditures incurred in the conduct of fire insurance in this country the disbursements for which were drawn also directly 1As the dividends paid by foreign companies transacting business in the United States are in a great measure dependent on the results of European underwriting they cannot serve as a criterion of conditions in this country and therefore are not considered 4I6 4Fire Insurance Rates and Methods from the pockets of the public Over fourteen million five hundred thousand dollars were paid out for sundry expenses by these same companies in 1902 So that in that year these American companies combined actually retained 47644ooo for themselves their agents and their expenses and as indemnity to the public they paid how much less than sixtysix million dollars Yet every penny of this money was furnished by the insuring public What would be thought of the methods of a savings bank which could say to the public We shall allow you to deposit your savings in our bank and you will he allowed to draw on your account at sixty days sight2 on condition that for every II4 which you deposit we shall be allowed to retain 48 for ourselves this sum to be retained by us not for a certain short time but for all time That in a crude way illustrates what the American fire insurance companies said to the public of the United States in I902 They even went further as will be shown From I86o to 1902 inclusive the average yearly premium on a policy of Ioooo charged by all the jointstock fire insurance companies doing business in the United States has been as follows Years 186070   8032 187180  9432 i88190  9880 I89195    o640 1896900  148 1901I I   0605 1902 II5I8 It will be seen that the price charged for furnishing insurance today is much higher than at any time in the last fortytwo years Leaving this phase of the matter out of the question for the time being one finds further that during the same periods these contracts of insurance involved the fire insurance companies in the following losses by fire for every Iooo0 of risk assumed by them Years  I86070  4655 i86o70 4655 I8780 5060 I88190  4870 88igo 4870 I89195  5167 2 According to insurance policies losses are payable at any time within sixty days after ascertainment thereof though in justice to the companies it is only fair to say that in general they do not avail themselves of the full delay accorded to them 417 5The Annals of the American Academy Years I896900  4292 9  45I5 1902  4417 It will be noted that fire insurance losses are not growing worse The difference between the amount deposited by the public with the insurance companies and the amount refunded by these com panies constitutes the gross residue retained by the companies for exercising the privilege of being trustees of and depositaries for the publics funds The publics share of its own premiums compares with the companies share thereof as follows ross Residue Returned of Charge to Years to Public Public 186070  4655 3377 187180  5060 4372 i88I90  4870 50Io 189195  5167 5473 1896900  4292 5856 90  4515 6090 I902  44I7 7OI The premiums charged to the public have been such as to permit a continually growing sum to be at the disposal of the companies for some purpose or other after reimbursing the public for losses suffered However that is a detail the main fact which we wish to keep in mind is this last year 1902 the average charge for a policy of insurance for Ioooo was 11518 and under this same policy there was paid out an average indemnity of 44I7 The pub lic made a deposit of 11I58 and of this sum drew out 44I7 The trustees kept the change Lest it may appear incredible that such a condition of affairs really existed the following corroborative figures are reproduced from the latest report3 1903 of the Insurance Commissioner of Connecticut It should be remembered that the figures given are compiled by the Insurance Commissioner of Connecticut from the sworn statements of the companies themselves They cover the operations of all the representative American stock fire insurance companies and for reasons already given do not cover the opera tions of European companies transacting business in this country a Any one can obtain this report for the mere request The figures will be found on pages 689 to 698 Reports published by almost any other state will furnish the same infor mation though in somewhat less convenient form 418 6Fire Insurance

Salaries and fees  7770000 Taxes  3334000 All other disbursements  95I9000 Total outgo  II652I000 The foregoing figures represent the joint operations of prac tically all the American fire insurance companies They show that after paying all the losses of the year after paying out half as much as the losses merely for dividends and commissions after paying out all the disbursements the total income exceeded the total outgo by about thirty million dollars Now the aggregate paidup capital of the companies in question was in round figures 47000000 so that this excess of total income over total outgo would suffice to pay further dividends of about 63 per cent on the paidup capital It will be said that much of this 30000000 is not necessarily an item of profit but that it represents in fact the sum of premiums which have not been fully earned Let us see how accurate this is The law requires fire insurance companies to have on hand an unearned premium fund amounting to onehalf of what is paid in to them so that a policyholder canceling a policy mav be reim bursed the ratable portion of the premium paid This liability is constantly being incurred and constantly being removed For the dollars which at this moment are being impounded there are the dollars being released which were put in escrow as it were a vear ago Thus the liability reserve can only be considered to affect our statement in regard to that portion of the above 30000000 419 7The Annals of the American Academy which corresponds to an increase of business If in this month a company receive as premiums IIoo for every iooo which it received in the corresponding month of last year it is evident that under the provisions of the law for every IIoo which it impounds today it can release but Io00 of fully earned premiums Now the natural increase of business does not materially affect this 30 oooooo Let it be assumed that in one way or the other even one half of this sum disappeared in the next twelve months there would still remain a sum equal to 32 per cent on the capital available for dividend purposes WVe may be told also that most of this 30000000 would be placed in a surplus fund to be used for the benefit of the public in case of a sweeping fire bringing unusual loss The companies have been providing for this possible calamity for years by means of greatly inflated surplus funds created by the public and earning great interest and dividends But the lays of conflagrations such as swept Chicago thirty years ago have probably gone and a con tingency so remote should not be made the excuse for a perpetual heavy tax of insurance One of the latest calamities that which visited Jacksonville Fla caused an insurance loss of only 5932500 As compared with the surplus above mentioned surely an insignifi cant sum That the companies themselves do not really worry about the possibilities of sweeping conflagrations repeating the events of thirty years ago may be gathered from the fact that they do not hesitate to risk their all on the chance of such calamities not being repeated as witness the congested district of Chicago where alone 170000 ooo is at stake Proportionately large sums are risked similarly in the conflagration districts of Philadelphia Boston and other large towns It will be shown below that even in regard to this con flagration fund the public is being sorely abused The full extent of the exploitation to which the public submits is understood only after tracing the origin of the secondary sources of income enjoyed by the fire insurance companies If we revert to the income and outgo account for the year 1902 we find that over thirteen million dollars out of a total income of I46oooooo was due to interests dividends rents and other sources This I3 oooooo arose from what is generally called the investment income in contradistinction to the remainder the underwriting income 420 8Fire Insurance Rates and Methods The paidup capital of the companies furnishing this income account amounted to about 47oooooo This sum was in no wise sunk as it would be if invested in any industry none of it went into machines raw material mines rolling stock or right of way It was all the time visible tangible dormant in the banks It was practically a token of good faith nothing more By reason of this deposit in the banks by virtue of this evidence of good faith the owners of this 47oooooo00 by law were permitted to offer insurance against fire and to demand for this insurance such consideration as they pleased and among themselves agreed to charge The public having accepted these offers of insurance drew from its pockets considerations called premiums to the amount of over one hun dred and twentyeight million dollars Of this I28000000 there was refunded as indemnity for losses 64000000 The remainder of these premiums 64000000 and the original 47000000 which of course was intact belong to the fire insurance companies by law They could close their business tomorrow and the public could not say nay Instead the companies left their capital of 47000000 in the banks and out of that part of the premiums not touched by fire they paid dividends and commissions and salaries and taxes and as has been seen had a great fund left over This fund amounting to many millions they placed in the banks alongside of the untouched capital of 47oooooo and they called it a surplus fund put there to pay losses in case the public had another Jacksonville fire Now since the public furnished all the premiums out of which all the losses and all the dividends and all the salaries and all the other items were paid the surplus or conflagration fund was in reality the excess charge demanded of the public over and above what was sufficient compensation for trouble and risk taken though if any Jacksonville fire should recur the indemnity for the fire would be paid out of the accumulated surplus saved out of the publics money and next year thepublic would be further assessed the recent conflagration serving as excuse All of this money all of this excess charge over and above the amount necessary to recompense the custodians and administrators of the publics contributions should be held in trust as the property of the insuring public By all moral ethical and financial rights the conflagration fund belongs to the insurers But it never will be 421 9The Annals of the American Academy theirsunless the law is changed Instead this fund will grow and growing too big some fine day it will melt away as an extra divi dend of 40 or 60 per cent or else it will amalgamate with the dormant capital of 47000000 so that the shareowners will own two shares of stock where now they own but one But it will be said supposing that the companies owning this capital of 47000000 had not been able to pay losses and expenses and dividends out of the contributions of the public would they not have drawn upon this 47000000 their capital Assume that they had the inevitable result would be that next year the public would be forced willy nilly to pay enough to make good the impairment of the 47000000 and besides that would be severely taxed for not having in the previous year contributed enough premiums to pay for all its losses and all the commissions and all the dividends and the sundry items and the conflagration fund It is a distinctive feature of these insurance companies that they act as one man throughout the country in every town and village There is no competition among them but on the contrary a most exclusive and brotherly entente cordiale Hence when in the recesses of their council chambers they reach a conclusion be it right or wrong that they have lost money with hearts thatbeat as one they set out to seek that which they have lost and so far their quests have been successful It isseen that by reason of practically depositing a bond of 47 oooooo fire insurance companies were entrusted with premiums of I28ooo000  Whilst they were the custodians of these premiums their capital was earning interest even if only a beggarly 3 per cent In the same way the trust fund the 128000000 was earn ing interestwhich interest was retained by the trustees of course not interest on I280000oo for 365 days for this trust fund came in gradually and little by little some of it disappeared for fire and expenses But a great deal was there all the year If it be assumed that in view of what was held for the year the whole amount earned an average of 3 per cent then 3840ooo would have heen earned as interest or dividends In the same way at the end of the year when the conflagration fund became swollen by the excess of the publics contributions another source of interest and dividends was created On the supposition that the above modest sum of 3840ooo could have been earned it would of itself have sufficed to pay a 422 IO0Fire Insurance Rates and Methods dividend of 8 I6 per cent on 47000000 which dividend added to the 3 per cent assumed to be earned by the 4700000o lying in the banks would make II I6 per cent joint interest and dividends A handsome return on money invested as investments go today From the observations immediately preceding one may gather that the interest earned on the capital merely deposited in banks and the interest derived from the use of the publics premiums together produce an income ample enough to enable the companies to renounce all further claims to compensation that is to run the underwriting account at bare cost without a cent of profit Underwriting profits such as are insisted upon by the insurance companies are in the nature of extortion and a display of their underwriting results alone without a simultaneous display of their investment profits is a delusion of the insuring public The public may view with a certain amount of indifference the fact that it furnishes all the funds that go to indemnify it for losses that it sacrifices at least onehalf of its contributions for the sake of having the remaining half administered it may contemplate with equanimity the fact that this cost of guardianship is today greater than ever before it may overlook the greed of companies which exact today the greatest dividends since I860 it may know that tlle recent startling increase in the rates was absolutely unwarranted and that 20 per cent of the spoils thereof immediately went to brokers already better paid than ever before Yet surely the public temper should be stirred when it reflects that it is not even given credit for the serious and persistent efforts which it has made and continues to make in the direction of fire prevention and extinction In the last thirty years vast improvements in protection have been made by the public buildings are better constructed fire retarding materials and devices have been introduced fire alarms watchmens clocks automatic sprinklers chemical fire pails have been put in water supplies and pumps have been improved hazards recognized and avoided better brigades drilled and maintained better equipments furnishedin fact the responsible insured have spent huge sums to keep fires down Fires have been kept down as the figures show and yet the vast expenditures by property owners to protect their premises and cities so as to avoid fire and to provide for its prompt extinction have merely resulted in the highest average premium in the last fortytwo years Is it not 423 IIThe A4nnals of the American Acadeimy evident that there is something woefully defective in the system that brings about such results It would be impossible within the space now at command to deal with every aspect of fire insurance deficiencies An endeavor has been made to show that viewing the question on its economic or financial side only the public is being wretchedly exploited Only a brief indication can be given of how this exploitation is accentuated by the languid attitude of the companies and their agents towards the ethical elements of insurance It has been shown that the whole fire insurance bill with the terrible waste and insatiable greed involved has to be settled by the section of the business community which is responsible and honest It is one of the worst one of the most glaring defects of the present methods of insurance that the insured are not only heavily taxed for the benefit of their trustees but that in view of the fact that fourfifths of the fire loss is due to incendiarism and criminal carelessness the honest and careful must pay heavily for the crime and folly of the unscrupulous and careless It is unreasonable that for so many years in succession the fire loss should maintain such huge dimensions This heavy loss has persisted because of the erroneous principles upon which the business of insurance is conducted Consider one element alone the accept ance of a risk in nearly every case the desirability of accept ing a risk should be gauged by the moral character of the applicant for insurance The nature of this character whilst ascertainable by the agent familiar with local conditions is most often beyond the ken of the companies head men The man who is to receive 20 per cent of the premium is naturally not too cautious in regard to the acceptance of risks and certainly with this 20 per cent in prospect it would be strange if the benefit of a doubt were not given in his own favor It is well known that among stock companies no ade quate or efficient system exists for checking moral risks and it is equally well known that the vast majority of fire losses are con sequent upon moral laxities of some kind or other chief among which may be classed gross negligence and carelessness and other preventable conditions With the great majority of applicants for insurance the prevailing methods are inadequate to gauge these qualities Much loss also could be obviated if the companies sought more actively to eliminate the causes of fire and to increase the facilities 424 12Fire Insurance Rates and Methods for extinguishing it rather than to await its scourgings and then to raise prices The easiest manner of recouping themselves for losses has of course been the raising of rates but this act does not coerce destructive elements and classes into becoming a profitable invest ment at least it never has It merely swells the agents income and places a heavier burden on the honest insured The most efficacious means of improving fire conditions is to enlist personal selfishness on the side of fire prevention As long as a state which invites fire costs for insurance scarcely more than a condition which precludes fire 50 per cent of the premiums will burn up each year For today most people buy insurance because it allows them to become more careless Among heavy insurers the truth begins to be realized that they have been grouped and allied with innumerable heterogeneous and utterly undesirable elements for the purpose of paying individual losses out of the common purse Also the conviction gains ground that under existing methods of insurance those who as a class have an excellent record and do not burn down must neces sarily pay the indemnity given to those classes who do burn down frequently whether accidentally or with pleasure aforethought These heavy insurers in many instances have discovered that it is possible to form from among themselves a homogeneous mutually protective group rigidly defined in regard to business moral and physical hazard They have thereby set up conditions of mutual service which can be watched and controlled for the best benefit of all concerned They have not been burdened with the losses arising from elements more dangerous than themselves whether the dangers were inherent to the business conducted or to the character of the persons engaged therein The consequence of such action has been that these groups of insurers associated for mutual helpfulness have made immense savings whilst securing ample protection No better illustration of the results obtainable by such organization can be afforded than by the New England Mutuals which today insure over one billion four hundred million dollars worth of factory property at a net cost of about fourteen cents per Ioo of insurance Despite the great difficulties of organization and of develop ment attaching to such associations for mutual benefit despite the spirit of suspicious antagonism often evinced and the shortsighted ness often displayed when the public is asked to bestir itself for 425 I314 The Annals of the American Academy selfinterest and common benefit the business community more and more will protect itself against loss by fire by forming voluntary associations of men known to each other engaged in the same busi ness exposed to the same hazards and convinced of their individual inability to have a successful fire For such as fail to ally them selves under such conditions and for such purposes there will always remain the present method and plan of insurance However the dignity of the profession and the public peace of mind call aloud for the introduction of more intelligent more economical less distasteful and less evident methods of exploitation WALTER C BETTS Philadelphia

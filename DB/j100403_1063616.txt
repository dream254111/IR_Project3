J100403,VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW,1063616,THE EIGHT HOUR RAILWAY WAGE LAW,I243784,VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW VOL IV NOVEMBER 1916 NO 2 THE EIGHT HOUR RAILWAY WAGE LAW T HE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE CAPITAL INVESTED IN THE RAILROADS IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE LABOR INVOLVED IN THEIR OPERA TION HAVING BECOME SO ACUTE THAT THEIR REPRESENTATIVES COULD NO LONGER AGREE UPON THE TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT THE FOURTH DAY OF SEPTEMBER 1916 WAS DEFINITELY FIXED FOR A STRIKE OF SUCH MAG NITUDE AS TO INVOLVE THE PRACTICAL SUSPENSION OF ALL RAILROAD SERV ICE IN THE UNITED STATES FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD THE CALAMITY WITH WHICH THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES WERE THUS CONFRONTED INVOLVED A SUSPENSION OF THE MAILS AND THE STOPPAGE OF TRANS PORTATION AT A TIME WHEN THE MOVEMENT OF THE NATIONAL GUARD OF THE COUNTRY MIGHT BECOME IMPERATIVE AT ANY MOMENT THE FRUIT CROPS STOOD IN JEOPARDY OF PERISHING NO MANUFACTURING ENTER PRISE IN THE COUNTRY WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MOVE ITS PRODUCT AND THE FOOD SUPPLY IN MANY LOCALITIES WOULD SOON HAVE BEEN EX HAUSTED THERE IS HARDLY A MAN WOMAN OR CHILD IN THE LAND WHO WOULD NOT HAVE FELT THE LOSS AND IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO OVER ESTIMATE THE NUMLER OF THOSE WHO WOULD HAVE SUFFERED PRIVA TION NOR WAS THERE ANY HOPE THAT IF THE NATION ACCEPTED THE TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCE OF PERMITTING THE RAILROADS ANL THEIR EMPLOY EES TO FIGHT IT OUT THE SETTLEMENT WOULD BE PERMANENT WHETHER LABOR WON THE FIGHT OR LOST FOR IT IS USELESS TO HOPE THAT WHEN THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN DOMINATED ONCE LEARN TO FIGHT THEY WILL BE EASILY DISCOURAGED LY FAILURE OR RESTRAINED BY SUCCESS THE CON FLICT BETWEEN CAPITAL AND LABOR HAS EVER INCREASED IN ITS INTENSITY AS LABOR HAS BECOME ORGANIZED AND MORE POWERFUL IN ITS IN FLUENCE AND THE CONFLICT WILL INEVITABLY GO ON UNTIL IT IS DEFINITELY SETTLED AS TO WHO SHALL BE THE MASTERVIRGINIA LAW REVIEW WHEN AN ENTERPRISE IS PRIVATE IN ITS NATURE WE MUST RELY FOR AN ADJUSTMENT OF THIS CONFLICT UPON THE NATURAL LAWS OF SUPPLY AND DEMANDONCE REGARDED AS CONTROLLING BUT NOW OFTEN IN COMPETENT TO PROTECT THE CONSUMER FROM IMMEDIATE SACRIFICEAT LEAST UNTIL IT IS RECOGNIZED THAT COMBINATIONS TO CONTROL THE PRICE OF LABOR ARE OFTEN JUST AS VICIOUS AS COMBINATIONS TO CONTROL THE PRICE OF ANY OTHER COMMODITY AND THE STRIKE COMES TO BE REGU LATED BY STATUTE WITH A PUBLIC SERVICE IT IS DIFFERENT THE RIGHT TO CONTRACT HAS NEVER BEEN REGARDED AS ABSOLUTE1 IT EXISTS ONLY WHERE IT DOES NOT CONFLICT WITH THE PUBLIC WELFARE AND THERE IS NO REASON WHY THE PUBLIC SHOULD CONSENT TO SUFFER GREAT INJURY IN ORDER TO PER MIT CAPITAL AND LABOR TO FIGHT EACH OTHER OVER TERMS OF EMPLOY MENT WHEN THE PRACTICAL RESULT OF THE CONFLICT MUST BE THE DE STRUCTION OF PUBLIC BUSINESS PROPERTY AND WELFARE THERE ARE THREE INTERESTS INVOLVED IN THE PUBLIC RAILROAD SERVICE THAT OF CAPITAL THAT OF LABOR AND THAT OF THE PEOPLE AT LARGE THE CON TRIBUTION OF EACH IS ESSENTIAL TO THE SERVICE THE MAN THE PLANT AND THE CAPITAL EMPLOYED IN THE OPERATION OF INTERSTATE RAILROADS ARE ALL EQUALLY TO BE REGARDED AS INSTRUMENTS OF THE PUBLIC SERV ICE AND SUBJECT TO PUBLIC CONTROL IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THAT SERV ICE2 AS EARLY AS THE CASE OF SEARIGHT V STOKESS CHIEF JUSTICE TANEY POINTED OUT THAT THE UNITED STATES HAVE UNQUESTIONABLY A PROPERTY IN THE MAILS THEY ARE NOT MERE COMMON CARRIERS BUT A GOVERN MENT PERFORMING A HIGH OFFICIAL DUTY IN HOLDING AND GUARD ING ITS OWN PROPERTY AS WELL AS THAT OF ITS CITIZENS COMMITTED TO ITS CARE FOR A VERY LARGE PORTION OF THE LETTERS AND PACK AGES CONVEYED ON THIS ROAD ESPECIALLY DURING THE SESSIONS OF CONGRESS

HOW 151 169 84THE EIGHT HOUR LAW LIC CONCERN    WE THINK THAT A CARRIAGE WHENEVER IT IS CARRYING THE MAIL IS LADEN WITH THE PROPERTY OF THE UNITED STATES WITHIN THE TRUE MEANING OF THE COMPACT THIS LANGUAGE WAS QUOTED WITH APPROVAL IN THE CASE OF IN RE DEBS 4 IT APPEARS THEREFORE THAT IN COMPELLING THE RAILROADS TO SUB MIT TEMPORARILY TO THE ONLY SCALE OF WAGES UPON WHICH THEY COULD CONDUCT THEIR BUSINESS WITHOUT SERIOUS INTERRUPTION THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT WAS SIMPLY PROHIBITING THE RAILROADS FROM DESTROYING BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PROPERTY THE VALUE OF WHICH DEPENDED UPON TRANSPORTATION THE QUESTION WAS NOT WHETHER CONGRESS SHOULD YIELD TO THE DEMAND OF LABOR FOR THE PASSAGE OF THIS STATUTE BUT WHETHER CONGRESS SHOULD PERMIT THE INTERSTATE COMMON CARRIERS TO SUSPEND THE PERFORMANCE OF THEIR PUBLIC FUNCTIONS FOR WHICH THEY HAD RECEIVED SO LARGE A CONSID ERATION FROM THE HANDS OF THE PUBLIC IN ORDER TO PROTECT THEIR PRIVATE INTERESTS ALTHOUGH THIS INTEREST COULD BE AMPLY PROTECTED AT A MUCH SMALLER LOSS BY A READJUSTMENT OF THE FREIGHT RATES NOT ONLY WERE THESE INSTRUMENTALITIES ENGAGED IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE BUT THE BUSINESS WHICH THEY WERE CONDUCTING WAS MADE POSSIBLE ONLY BY PUBLIC CONSENT AND THE RIGHT OF EMINENT DOMAIN THE RELATION BETWEEN THE EMPLOYER AND THE EMPLOYEE WAS IN NO JUST SENSE A PRIVATE RELATION FOR THE PUBLIC WAS CONCERNED IN THAT RELATION JUST AS MUCH AS WERE THE OTHER TWO PARTIES NOT ONLY BE CAUSE THE RIGHTS AND PROPERTY OF THE PUBLIC WERE DIRECTLY INVOLVED AND NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE PUBLIC CONCESSIONS MADE IN CONSID ERATION OF A PUBLICLY REGULATED SERVICE BUT ALSO BECAUSE THE PUB LIC WAS TO PAY FOR THE SERVICE RENDERED BY THE COMBINED EFFORTS OF CAPITAL AND LABOR AT A RATE OF FREIGHT BASED UPON THE SCALE OF WAGES WHENEVER THERE ARE THREE INTERESTS INVOLVED AND IT BECOMES AP PARENT THAT THERE IS A DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN TWO OF THESE INTER ESTS WHICH THEY CANNOT SETTLE BETWEEN THEMSELVES WITHOUT GREAT INJURY TO THE RIGHTS AND PROPERTY OF THE THIRD IT IS BUT NATURAL AND PROPER THAT THE THIRD PARTY SHOULD ASSERT ITS LEGITIMATE POWER TO COMPEL THE OTHER TWO TO COME TO TERMS WHEN THEREFORE THE RAILROADS AND THEIR EMPLOYEES HAVE REACHED A POINT WHERE THEY 158 U S 564 584 85VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW CAN NO LONGER AGREE AND WHERE THIS DISAGREEMENT THREATENS TO DESTROY THE PUBLIC SERVICE THE TIME HAS ASSUREDLY COME WHEN THE PUBLIC MUST SAY TO THEM YOU MUST EITHER SERVE THE PUBLIC OR YOU MUST GIVE UP YOUR FRANCHISE AND IF YOU CANNOT SERVE THE PUB LIC BY PAYING ONE WAGE YOU MUST PAY ANOTHER NO ONE WILL DENY THE WISDOM OF INVESTIGATION BEFORE ACTION WHENEVER INVESTIGATION IS POSSIBLE BUT IT IS EQUALLY PLAIN THAT THERE ARE MANY SITUATIONS IN LIFE WHEN MEN MUST ACT UPON THEIR JUDGMENT AND ACT AT ONCE RATHER THAN SUFFER INJURY FROM DELAY NECESSARILY INCIDENT TO INVESTIGATION IT IS OFTEN NECESSARY TO PRE SERVE THE STATUS QUO WHILE AN INVESTIGATION PROCEEDS AND THIS MAY NOT BE DENIED BY ANY PERSON WHO IS FAMILIAR WITH THE CHAN CERY PRACTICE OF USING INJUNCTIONS PENDENTE LITE IN ORDER TO PRE SERVE THE STATUS QUO UNTIL INVESTIGATION CAN BE MADE WHEN AN INJUNCTION OF THIS KIND IS NECESSARY AT ALL IT IS ALWAYS NECESSARY TO ACT WITHOUT SUCH AN INVESTIGATION AS WOULD JUSTIFY A FINAL DECREE IN ORDER TO PRESERVE THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE INQUIRY UNTIL IT CAN BE ASCERTAINED WHERE THE RIGHT OF THE MATTER REALLY LIES TO DESTROY THIS WRIT SO AS TO ENABLE ONE PARTY TO DESTROY THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE CONTROVERSY PENDING AN INVESTIGATION BY THE COURT WOULD BE TO DEPRIVE THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE OF ONE OF ITS MOST EFFICIENT INSTRUMENTS IN THIS INSTANCE THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE CONTROVERSY WAS THE PUBLIC SERVICE FOR IT IS UPON THIS SERVICE THAT THE BURDEN OF THE THREATENED STRIKE WOULD HAVE FALLEN IF THE STRIKE HAD BEEN CON SUMMATED AND MORE THAN THIS THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO POS SIBLE WAY OF ADJUSTING THE LOSS AFTER IT HAD ONCE OCCURRED ON THE OTHER HAND THERE WAS NOT THE SLIGHTEST DIFFICULTY IN PROTECT ING THE RAILROADS FROM ANY LOSS THEY MIGHT SUFFER BY REASON OF FIXING AN EXCESSIVE SCALE OF WAGES PENDING AN INVESTIGATION IF IT SHOULD BE DETERMINED THAT THE SCALE WAS TOO HIGH THE CHARGES WHICH THE INTERSTATE COMMON CARRIER IS PERMITTED TO DEMAND FROM THE PUBLIC FOR ITS SERVICE ARE FIXED BY LAW AND ARE NECESSARILY BASED UPON THE SCALE OF WAGES PAID IT WOULD NEVER BE POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER ANY RATE WAS FAIR OR WHETHER IT WAS CON FISCATORY EXCEPT BY TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE WAGES WHICH THE RAILROADS MUST PAY FOR THE SERVICE OF THEIR EMPLOYEES AND WHEN EVER IT IS DETERMINED THAT THE SCALE OF WAGES WHICH IS FIXED BY THE 86THE EIGHT HOUR LAW DEMANDS OF LABOR OR BY AN ENACTMENT OF CONGRESS IS SO HIGH THAT THE PREVAILING FREIGHT RATE IS INADEQUATE THERE IS NOT THE SLIGHT EST DIFFICULTY IN ADMINISTERING JUSTICE THROUGH THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION CONGRESS WAS THEREFORE CONFRONTED WITH A SITUATION IN WHICH A FAILURE UPON ITS PART TO ACT WOULD RESULT IN INESTIMABLE DAMAGE TO THE PUBLIC A SITUATION IN WHICH IT COULD AVOID THIS DAMAGE ONLY BY FIXING A TEMPORARY RATE AT WHICH THE MEN WERE WILLING TO WORK FOR IT IS MANIFEST THAT IT WAS ENTIRELY BEYOND ITS CONSTITUTIONAL POWER TO COMPEL THE MEN TO WORK A SITUATION IN WHICH THERE WAS NO DANGER OF DOING ANY INJUSTICE TO ANY INTEREST AS IT WAS EASILY WITHIN THE POWER OF CONGRESS AND OF ITS AGENCIES TO REIMBURSE THE RAILROADS FOR ANY INJURY WHICH PRELIMINARY REGULATION MIGHT DO BY INCREASING THE FREIGHT RATE IF NECESSARY JUST AS IT IS WITHIN THE POWER OF THE COURTS TO REIMBURSE ANY INJURY WRHICH THEY MAY DO BY THE ISSU ANCE OF A TEMPORARY INJUNCTION OR INJUNCTION PENDENTE LITE BY AN ACTION UPON THE BOND IN THIS DILEMMA CONGRESS ACTED AND WE TURN TO THE INQUIRY AS TO WHETHER IT IS WITHIN THE CONSTITUTIONAL POWER OF CONGRESS TO REGULATE THE SCALE OF WAGES TO BE PAID BY THOSE ENGAGED IN PUBLIC INTERSTATE SERVICE CONFISCATION WAS NOT INVOLVED BECAUSE CONFIS CATION COULD RESULT ONLY FROM A DISPROPORTION BETWEEN THE SCALE OF WAGES AND THE SCALE OF FREIGHT AND SO LONG AS THE SCALE OF FREIGHT IS MOVABLE THERE CAN BE NO DIFFICULTY IN ADJUSTMENT TREATED AS A REGULATION OF THE HOURS OF LABOR BY TRAINMEN THE VALIDITY OF THE STATUTE IS OF COURSE BEYOND DISCUSSION5 WHILE IT IS DOUBT LESS TRUE THAT THE ENACTMENT TENDED STRONGLY TO THE ESABLISHMENT OF AN EIGHT HOUR DAY IT MUST BE CONCEDED THAT THAT WHICH THE STATUTE DIRECTLY ENACTED WAS TO REGULATE THE WAGES TO BE PAID BY THE RAILROAD COMPANIES TO THEIR EMPLOYEES FOR A LIMITED PERIOD PENDING AN INVESTIGATION IT THEREFORE REMAINS ONLY TO INQUIRE WHETHER THE FIXING OF THE SCALE OF WAGES TO BE PAID TO THE EMPLOY EES OF INTERSTATE RAILROADS WAS WITHIN THE CONSTITUTIONAL POWER OF CONGRESS TO REGULATE INTERSTATE COMMERCE IT IS NOW TOO LATE TO QUESTION THE POWER OF CONGRESS TO REG ULATE THE RATE OF FREIGHT TO BE CHARGED FOR THE SERVICE OF AN IN TERSTATE COMMON CARRIER AND THE POWER TO DETERMINE WHAT 6 HOLDEN V HARDY SUPRA LOCHNER V NEW YORK 198 U S 45 87VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW COMPENSATION IS TO BE ALLOWED FOR THE WHOLE SERVICE NECESSARILY CARRIES WITH IT THE POWER TO DETERMINE JUST HOW THAT COMPENSATION SHALL BE DIVIDED AMONG THE DIFFERENT INSTRUMENTALITIES WHICH GO TO MAKE UP THE COMMON CARRIER AS A WHOLE IN ORDER TO DETER MINE WHAT IS A PROPER FREIGHT RATE IT IS OF COURSE NECESSARY TO INQUIRE WHAT ARE THE ELEMENTS WHICH ENTER INTO THE SERVICE WHAT IS THE COST OF THE TRACK ITS CONSTRUCTION AND ITS MAINTENANCE WHAT IS THE EXTENT OF THE INVESTMENT IN ROLLING STOCK AND WHAT IS NECESSARY FOR ITS MAINTENANCE WHAT IS THE COST OF THE LABOR CONTRIBUTED AND WHAT SHOULD BE THE PROFIT AL LOWED ON THE CAPITAL INVESTED TO SAY THAT CONGRESS HAS NO POWER TO FIX THE COMPENSATION TO BE ALLOWED TO LABOR IS AS UNWARRANTED AS IT IS TO SAY THAT CONGRESS HAS NO POWER TO DEAL WITH THE SUBJECT AS TO THE COMPENSATION WHICH IS ALLOWED ON THE CAPITAL INVESTED INDEED THE POWER OF CONGRESS TO FIX OR TO LIMIT THE COMPENSATION WHICH THE INTERSTATE COMMON CARRIER SHALL PAY TO ITS EMPLOYEES NECESSARILY RESULTS FROM THE SIMPLE FACT THAT THIS COMPENSATION IS ONLY A PART OF THAT WHICH IS ALLOWED TO BE COLLECTED FROM THE PUBLIC AND THAT THE ALLOWANCE WHICH MUST BE MADE FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF LABOR IS NOT TO BE DIFFERENTIATED FROM THE ALLOWANCE THAT IS TO BE SET APART AS COMPENSATION FOR THE USE OF THE CAPITAL INVESTED CONGRESS HAS INDEED SO FRE QUENTLY ENACTED AND THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS SO FREQUENTLY SUPPORTED OTHER STATUTES OF A SIMILAR CHARAC TER THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO REALIZE THAT THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF SUCH A STATUTE SHOULD NOW BE INVEIGHED AGAINST THE PILOT WHO DIRECTS THE SHIP INTO PORT STANDS UPON THE SAME FOOTING AS THE ENGINEER WHO DIRECTS THE LOCOMOTIVE THE POWER OF CONGRESS AND INDEED THE POWER OF THE STATES TO FIX THE COMPENSATION WHICH SHALL BE PAID TO PILOTS IS BASED UPON THE IDEA THAT THEY ARE ENGAGED IN A PUBLIC SERVICE IN WHICH THE PEOPLE AT LARGE ARE CONCERNED CONGRESS COULD REGULATE THEIR CHARGES ONLY UNDER THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE CLAUSE OF THE CONSTITUTION BUT THE POWER OF CONGRESS TO FIX THE COMPENSATION WHICH SHOULD BE PAID TO THE PILOT FOR HIS PERSONAL SERVICES WAS SETTLED FROM A VERY EARLY PERIOD IN THE CASE OF EX PARE MCNCIL JUDGE SWAYNE IN RENDERING THE OPINION OF THE COURT SAID  SUPRA 88THE EIGHT HOUR LAW IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT PILOT REGULATIONS ARE REGULATIONS OF COMMERCE A PILOT IS AS MUCH A PART OF THE COMMERCIAL MARINE AS THE HULL OF THE SHIP AND THE HELM BY WHICH IT IS GUIDED AND HALF PILOTAGE AS IT IS CALLED IS A NECESSARY AND USUAL PART OF EVERY SYSTEM OF SUCH PROVISIONS THIS CASE INVOLVED THE VALIDITY OF A STATUTE NOT ONLY FIXING THE COMPENSATION WHICH A PILOT SHOULD RECEIVE FOR HIS SERVICES BUT COMPELLING THE SHIP TO PAY HALF PILOTAGE IF IT HAD NOT ACCEPTED THE SERVICES OF THE PILOT WHEN TENDERED THE AUTHOR OF THE OPINION POINTED OUT THAT FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL THE COMPENSATION OF PILOTS HAS BEEN REGULATED BY THE STATES THE ACT OF CONGRESS APPROVED AUGUST 7 17897 PROVIDED THAT PILOTAGE SHOULD BE REG ULATED BY THE EXISTING LAWS OF THE STATES OR SUCH LAWS AS THE STATES SHOULD THEREAFTER ENACT UNTIL FURTHER PROVISIONS SHOULD BE MADE BY THE CONGRESS AND THIS PROVISION IS NOW FOUND IN THE REVISED STATUTES OF THE UNITED STATES8 IN THE CASE OF GIBBONS V OGDEN9 THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES HELD THAT CONGRESS HAS THE POWER OF REENACTING THE STATE STATUTES UPON THIS SUBJECT AND FROM THIS EARLY DATE DOWN TO THE PRESENT TIME NO ONE HAS SUCCESSFULLY QUESTIONED THE CONSTITUTIONAL POWER OF CON GRESS TO FIX THE RATE OF COMPENSATION AS A REGULATION OF COMMERCE IN THE CASE OF CHARLOTTE C  A R CO V GIBBES1 THERE CAME BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES THE QUES TION AS TO WHETHER IT WAS COMPETENT FOR THE STATE TO REQUIRE THE RAILROADS TO PAY A FIXED SALARY TO RAILROAD COMMISSIONERS FOR THEIR SERVICES IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT AS IN THE CASE OF PILOTS THE SERVICES OF THE RAILROAD COMMISSIONERS WAS COMPULSORYTHE RAILROADS WERE NOT PERMITTED TO SAY WHETHER THEY CARED FOR THE SERVICE OR NOT SPEAKING OF THE SUBJECT THE COURT SAID THOUGH RAILROAD CORPORATIONS ARE PRIVATE CORPORATIONS AS DISTINGUISHED FROM THOSE CREATED FOR MUNICIPAL AND GOVERN MENTAL PURPOSES THEIR USES ARE PUBLIC THEY ARE FORMED FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE PUBLIC IN THE TRANSPORTATION OF PER SONS AND MERCHANDISE AND ARE INVESTED FOR THAT PURPOSE WITH SPECIAL PRIVILEGES THEY ARE ALLOWED TO EXERCISE THE STATES RIGHT OF EMINENT DOMAIN THAT THEY MAY APPROPRIATE FOR THEIR USES THE NECESSARY PROPERTY OF OTHERS UPON

THEIR CHARTERS THE OBLIGATIONS TO TRANSPORT ALL PERSONS AND MER CHANDISE UPON LIKE CONDITIONS AND AT REASONABLE RATES AND THEY ARE AUTHORIZED TO CHARGE REASONABLE COMPENSATION FOR THE SERVICES THEY THUS PERFORM BEING THE RECIPIENTS OF SPECIAL PRIVILEGES FROM THE STATE TO BE EXERCISED IN THE IN TEREST OF THE PUBLIC AND ASSUMING THE OBLIGATIONS THUS MEN TIONED THEIR BUSINESS IS DEEMED AFFECTED

SUPERVISION OF THE OPERATION OF THEIR ROADS WHICH MAY BE EXERCISED BY DIRECT LEGISLATION COMMANDING OR FORBIDDING UNDER SEVERE PENALTIES THE DO ING OR OMISSION OF PARTICULAR ACTS OR IT MAY BE EXERCISED THROUGH COMMISSIONERS SPECIALLY APPOINTED FOR THAT PURPOSE THE MODE OR MANNER OF REGULATION IS A MATTER OF LEGISLATIVE DISCRETION WHEN EXERCISED THROUGH COMMISSIONERS THEIR SERVICES ARE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE RAILROAD CORPORATIONS AS WELL AS OF THE PUBLIC BOTH ARE SERVED BY THE REQUIRED SUPER VISION OVER THE ROADS AND MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION AND THERE WOULD SEEM TO BE NO SOUND REASON WHY THE COMPENSATION OF THE COMMISSIONERS IN SUCH CASE SHOULD NOT BE MET BY THE CORPORATIONS THE OPERATIONS OF WHOSE ROADS AND THE EXER CISE OF WHOSE FRANCHISES ARE SUPERVISED IN EXACTING THIS THERE IS NO ENCROACHMENT UPON THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT REQUIRING THAT THE IBURDEN OF A SERVICE DEEMED ESSENTIAL TO THE PUBLIC IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE CORPORA TIONS AND THE EXERCISE OF PRIVILEGES OBTAINED AT THEIR RE QUEST SHOULD BE BORNE BY THE CORPORATIONS IN RELATION TO WHOM THE SERVICE IS RENDERED AND TO WHOM IT IS USEFUL IS NEITHER DENYING TO THE CORPORATIONS THE EQUAL PROTECTION OF THE LAWS NOR MAKING ANY UNJUST DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THEM THERE IS REALLY NOTHING NEW IN THE FIXING OF THE COMPENSATION TO BE PAID BY THE COMMON CARRIER FOR SERVICES WHICH THEY RECEIVE FROM INDIVIDUALS AND OTHER CORPORATIONS ASSISTING THEM IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THEIR DUTIES WE ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THE REG ULATION OF SWITCHING CHARGES THE REGULATION OF TAP LINE SERVICES AND THE LIKE 90THE EIGHT HOUR

POWER TO REGULATE NAVIGATION IS THE POWER TO PRESCRIBE RULES IN CONFORMITY WITH WHICH NAVIGATION MUST BE CARRIED ON IT EXTENDS TO THE PERSONS WHO CONDUCT IT AS WELL AS TO THE INSTRUMENTS USED THE COURT HELD THAT THE FIXING OF THE PILOTAGE FEES WAS NOTHING MORE NOR LESS THAN A REGULATION OF COMMERCE IT HAS LONG SINCE BEEN SETTLED THAT A STATE MAY REGULATE THE METHOD OF COMPENSATING COAL MINERS12 IN THE CASE OF MCLEAN V ARKANSAS13 THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES UPHELD THE STATUTE OF ARKANSAS REQUIRING COAL TO BE MEASURED FOR PAYMENT OF MINERS WAGES BEFORE SCREENING IT THE COURT SAID BUT IN MANY CASES IN THIS COURT THE RIGHT OF FREEDOM OF CON TRACT HAS BEEN HELD NOT TO BE UNLIMITED IN ITS NATURE AND WHLEL THE RIGHT TO CONTRACT OR CARRY ON BUSINESS CONFLICTS WITH LAWS DECLARING THE PUBLIC POLICY OF THE STATE ENACTED FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SAFETY OR WELFARE THE SAME MAY BE VALID NOTWITHSTANDING THEY HAVE THE EFFECT TO CURTAIL OR LIMIT THE FREEDOM OF

SAID BY MR CHIEF JUSTICE TANEY IN THE LICENSE CASES 5 HOW 583 ARE NOTHING MORE OR LESS THAN THE POWERS OF GOVERN MENT INHERENT IN EVERY SOVEREIGNTY    THAT IS TO SAY    THE POWER TO GOVERN MEN AND

LENGTH THAT WHATEVER MAY BE THE RIGHT OF A PRIVATE CITIZEN TO DEMAND WHAT EVER HE CAN GET FOR HIS OWN SERVICES OR FOR THE USE OF HIS PROP ERTY YET WHEN HE AND HIS PROPERTY BECOME ENLGAGED IN A PUBLIC BUSINESS THEY BECOME AFFECTED WITH THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND CEASE TO BE JURIS PRIZATI ONLY AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE PUBLIC CONTROL IN THE CASE OF ST LOUIS IRON MTN  ST PAUL RY CO V PAUL5 THE SUPREME COURT UPHELD THE STATUTE REQUIRING EMPLOYEES TO BE PAID IN MONEY WHEN DISCHARGED IN THE CASE OF ERIE R V WILLIAMTSLG THE SUPREME COURT UPHELD THE LAW REQUIRING RAILROAD EMPLOYEES TO BE PAID TWICE A MONTH IN THE CASE OF MORGANS S S CO V LOUISIAINA BOARD OF HEALTHL7 IT WAS HELD THAT CON GRESS COULD FIX QUARANTINE FEES AND SEAMENS WAGES HAVE AL WAYS BEEN REGULATED8 IT SEEMS THEREFORE TO BE CLEAR THAT IT IS WITHIN THE POWER OF CONGRESS AT ALL TIMES TO REGULATE THE WAGES WHICH ARE TO BE PAID BY THE INTERSTATE COMMON CARRIER TO ITS EMPLOYEES IT POSSESSES THIS POWER BECAUSE THE EMPLOYER AND THE EMPLOYEE ARE ENGAGED IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE THE BUSINESS WHICH THEY ARE CARRYING ON IS MADE POSSIBLE BY PUBLIC CONCESSION AND THE PUBLIC IS A PARTY TO THE ENTERPRISE THE REGULATION OF SUCH A BUSINESS HAS ALWAYS BEEN VESTED IN THE GOVERNMENT NOT FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE EMPLOYER OR OF THE EMPLOYEE BUT FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PUBLIC WHOM THEY BOTH SERVE THE RATES OF COMPENSATION WHICH THEY MAY RECEIVE FROM THE PUBLIC FOR THE ENTIRE SERVICE ARE DEFINITELY FIXED AND WHERE THERE ARE SEVERAL ELEMENTS WHICH GO TO MAKE UP THAT SERVICE SUCH AS THE CONTRIBUTION OF LABOR THE PROPERTY USED AND THE CAPITAL INVESTEDTHE COMPENSATION OF EACH OF THESE MUST BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN FIXING THE RATE FOR THE ENTIRE SERVICE AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE FREIGHT RATE ALLOWED FOR THE ENTIRE SERVICE AMONGST THE DIFFERENT CONTRIBUTORS TO THAT SERVICE MUST NECES SARILY BE WITHIN THE POWER OF CONGRESS IN WHOM THE REGULATION OF COMPENSATION FOR THE ENTIRE SERVICE IS VESTED AND THE EXERCISE OF THIS POWER MAY BE BY WAY OF FIXING EITHER A MINIMUM OR A MAXIMUM COMPENSATION TO BE PAID THE FIXING OF THE MINIMUILL COMPENSATION HAS BEEN NECESSARY IN THIS INSTANCE TO PRESERVE THE SERVICE TEMPORARILY PENDING AN IN

COM MON CARRIER TO PERFORM ITS FUNCTIONS UPON A REASONABLE TARIFF OF FREIGHT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE PUBLIC WITHOUT A SACRIFICE OF ALL COMPENSATION FOR THE CAPITAL INVESTED AND RESULTING CON FISCATION BY REASON OF THE DEMANDS OF LABOR WHICH ARE SO RAPIDLY INCREASING THE POWER OF CONGRESS TO FIX THE SCALE OF WAGES IS EXERCISED TODAY BY FIXING A MINIMUM WHICH SHALL BE PAID FOR LA BOR BUT IT MAY BE NECESSARY TOMORROW TO EXERCISE THAT SAME POWER IN FIXING A MAXIMUM IN ORDER THAT THE COMMON CARRIER AS A WHOLE MAY BE ENABLED TO SERVE THE PUBLIC UPON A REASONABLE BASIS CONGRESS OF COURSE HAS NO POWER TO COMPEL ANY MAN TO WORK FOR THE INTERSTATE COMMON CARRIER FOR LESS THAN HE MAY BE PLEASED TO DEMAND FOR WHILE IDLE OR ENGAGED IN SOME PRIVATE EMPLOY MENT HE IS NOT AN INSTRUMENT OF INTERSTATE COMMERCE HIS DOINGS ARE NOT CONCERNED WITH THE PUBLIC AND HIS POWER TO CONTRACT CAN NOT BE LIMITED NOR CAN CONGRESS COMPEL THE OWNERS OF THE PHYS ICAL PROPERTIES WHICH CONSTITUTE THE RAILROAD OR THE CAPITAL WHICH IS USED IN ITS OPERATION TO ENTER INTO ANY CONTRACT FOR SERVICE IN REGARD TO ANY PRIVATE UNDERTAKING19 BUT IT IS WITHIN THE POWER OF CONGRESS TO PRESCRIBE THE TERMS OF ANY CONTRACT WHICH HAS TO DO WITH THE PUBLIC SERVICE BY INTERSTATE COMMON CARRIERS AND IT MAY BE CONFIDENTLY ASSERTED THAT WHEN THE SCALE OF WAGES WHICH THE RAILROADS ARE COMPELLED TO PAY BECOMES SO GREAT AS TO MAKE THE PRESENT FREIGHT RATE IMPRACTICABLE OR UNFAIR THAT FREIGHT RATE WILL BE READJUSTED UNTIL THE DEMANDS OF LABOR BECOME SO GREAT THAT CAPITAL CANNOT RECEIVE A FAIR RETURN FOR ITS CONTRIBUTION TO THE SERVICE WITHOUT IMPOSING UPON THE PUBLIC A BURDEN WHICH IS DIS PROPORTIONATE TO ITS REAL VALUE AND WHEN THIS HAPPENS CONGRESS MUST FIX A SCALE OF WAGES WHICH WILL BE FAIR TO ALL PARTIES CON CERNED THUS IT MAY COME TO PASS THAT THE POWER OF CONGRESS TO FIX THE SCALE OF WAGES FOR THE EMPLOYEES OF INTERSTATE RAILROADS WILL SOME DAY PROVE TO BE THE GREATEST SAFEGUARD THAT EXISTS AGAINST RUINOUS INJUSTICE TOWARDS THE CAPITAL INVESTED IN INTERSTATE RAIL ROADS MOBILE ALA HARRY T SMITH  ADAIR V UNITED STATES 208 U S 161 94

BY GEORGE C SIKES Secretary Municipal Voters League Chicago The keynote of Chicagos public utility policy is home rule New York and Massachusetts are tending more and more toward state domination in such matters Chicago on the one hand and New York and Massachusetts on the other represent opposite tendencies Wisconsin is steering a middle course between the two Recent public utility laws of the Badger State provide for a combination of state regulation and local control In theory the Wisconsin method would seem to be the wisest of the three but public sentiment in Chicago insists upon the largest measure of home rule and under the conditions there existing this policy appears to be the safest Wisconsin has no great cities Mil waukee the largest has a population of only about 300000 In New York State there are other cities of considerable size besides the metropolis notably Buffalo with about 400000 inhabitants More important than all other considerations perhaps in explana tion of the difference of policies is the fact that New York City and Boston have been less vigorous than Chicago in their deter mination to oppose state interference in matters of municipal con cern Boston being the capital of Massachusetts is able however to protect its public rights before the legislature under a system of state domination in a better manner than can a community like Chicago which is not the seat of government Chicago with a population of more than 2000000 is located in a state which has no other city approaching even Iooooo in population Chicago and the rest of Illinois do not understand each other as well as they should The people of Illinois although they respond readily to such requests for help as can be brought home to them have a vague general mistrust and fear of the city by the lake The people of Chicago on the other hand have a corre sponding fear that the people of the state at large will not com prehend their great city problems and in case of state control would leave them at the mercy of officials amenable to influence by 689The Annals of the Americanl Academy special interests Corporate influences from time to time have suggested state regulation of local public utilities but the proposi tion has always met with such popular protest as to doom it to defeat In fact Illinois has even failed to provide effective state regulation over matters that properly call for that control such as the interurban phases of the street railroad business In the exercise of the home rule powers which Chicago insists upon that city appears to be groping toward a public utility policy with rather clearly lefinel features Speaking broadly those feat ures are i short term franchise grants with reservation to the city of the right of municipal purchase at any time or at stated intervals during the life of the grant 2 full publicity in the affairs of public utility corporations 3 regulation of rates and service by the city council 4 the disposition to promote unifica tion and to recognize the natural monopoly nature of public utility enterprises Of local public utilities in Chicago the street railways have occupied most attention in the public mind The first street railway franchise grants were made by the city council for twentyfive year periods The companies in 1865 secured legislation from the state which they confidently believed had changed these twentyfive year grants into ninetynine year grants So great was the public out cry at this outrage that the constitutional convention of 1870 sought to make its repetition forever impossible by providing that no future street railway grants could be made without the consent of the proper local authorities In I897 Mr Yerkes then the dominant figure in Chicago traction matters came forward with a proposition for a state commission to exercise control over all street railways Mr Yerkes program became a burning political issue and was repudiated While the state commission plan was defeated Mr Yerkes did secure from the legislature of I897 a law authorizing the city to make fifty year franchise grants where the statutory limit before had been twenty But the public outcry against this measure forced its repeal by the succeeding legislature without any grants having been conferred under it in the City of Chicago The street railway commission created by resolution of the city council submitted a report in December I9oo outlining a street railway policy for the City of Chicago which has been adhered to by the city more closely than even its framers anticipated 690 156Relation of Chicago to Public Service Corporations would be the case That commission recommended securing from the general assembly legislation authorizing the city to own and operate street railways as a prerequisite to any settlement of the street railway franchise question by the city council It was not the idea of this commission that the city should actually munici palize the lines at once The Chicago idea is that the city should have full power from the legislature to deal with the general sub ject in such manner as may seem to it wise It should be in a position either to municipalize or to secure service through a fran chise arrangement with a private corporation It was another im portant recommendation of this commission that a modified form of the indefinite term franchise grant in use in Massachusetts be adopted in Chicago The commission also urged unification through routes and universal transfers Due emphasis was laid upon the need for publicity In substance these recommendations have all been carried out The legislature passed an act known as the Mueller municipal ownership law giving Chicago the legal power to own and operate street railways That the legislature did not also confer upon the city at the same time the financial power actually to acquire street railways was due wholly to constitutional limitations which the legislature could not overcome The street railway franchise settlement ordinances approved by the people of Chicago on a referendum vote last April giveto the principal street railway companies twenty year renewals of their franchise grants These grants are subject to termination at any time on specified notice for the following purposes I for city purchase for municipal operation 2 for purchase by another corporation designated by the city but if such corporation is or ganized for profit it must pay for the property twenty per cent more than the city would be obliged to pay or 3 the grant may be terminated by purchase by a corporation designated by the city which shall agree to forego all profits in excess of five per cent on the investment and in this case the purchase price shall be the same as the city would be required to pay if it were the purchaser The purchase price for the city is to be the agreed price of the property at the time the ordinances were passed which agreed price was inserted in specific figures in the ordinances plus all new money thereafter expended by the companies under the supervision of the 69I I57The Annlals of the Americanz Academy city There are provisions designed to take care of depreciation The ordinances require unified operation with interchange of trans fers between companies Full publicity of accounts is required Under these ordinances the companies while they operate are to receive five per cent not upon their stock but upon their recognized investment and all earnings in excess of the five per cent are to be divided between the city and the companies in the ratio of fiftyfive per cent to the city and fortyfive per cent to the companies It is expected that the portion of the city under the first years operation will amount to nearly I5ooooo If the intent of the ordinances is carried out these revenues will not be utilized for ordinary municipal purposes but will be allowed to accumulate towards a purchase fund for the municipal acquisition of the street railways at some future time The elevated railroads of Chicago operate under fifty year grants which were made by the city council a dozen or more years ago There are four elevated railroad systems in addition to the union elevated loop which is used jointly by all At the present time the elevated railroad question is acute through the inability of the companies to handle their traffic properly and the public is taking advantage of the situation to demand unified operation through routes and interchange of transfers among the different elevated systems The public has not yet seriously begun to de mand unification and correlation of service as between the elevated roads and the surface roads but in the order of logical development that is the next step The gas company operates under a perpetual franchise secured many years ago Fifteen or twenty years ago there was an era of com petition in gas manufacture The council gave franchises usually for fiftyyear periods to competing companies The effort to maintain competition was abortive In I897 the gas and electric lighting inter ests secured from the legislature a law requiring the consent of abutting property owners as a prerequisite to the granting of a franchise for lighting purposes The practical effect of this law was to prevent further grants to competing gas companies By this time the people had become tired of seeking relief through competition As a result of much agitation the legislature was forced in I905 to pass a law authorizing the city council to regulate gas rates Under the authority thus conferred the price of gas was 692 I58Relation of Chicago to Public Service Corporations reduced by the council from one dollar to eightyfive cents per thousand feet The reduction was agreed to by the companies with out litigation on consideration that the city on its part would recognize the consolidation of companies and cease its harassing litigation The price of eightyfive cents was fixed for a period of five years after which period the council will be in a position to exercise its regulating authority again The electric light business has been carried on by the Chicago Edison Company under a twentyfive year franchise which will expire in I912 In I897 when gang influences dominated the city council a fifty year franchise was given to the Commonwealth Company supposed to be controlled by a group of speculating politicians Later men powerful in the Edison Company purchased the Commonwealth franchise and have sought to consolidate the two companies The company while claiming the consolidation is completely effected and legal still seems desirous of securing coun cils approval for the merger The same legislature that authorized the Chicago city council to regulate the price of gas also authorized the reasonable regula tion of electric light rates The council has been wrestling for some time with the question of regulation of such rates At this writ ing March 15 the question is under consideration The company is willing to agree to make certain rates and to pay the city three per cent of the gross receipts on its entire business if the city will recognize the consolidation Among other things there is a strong popular demand that the company as a condition of this ordinance agree to publicity of its affairs There are a number of companies doing a small electric lighting business within limited areas but none except the Commonwealth Edison Company covers the entire city The City of Chicago has a municipal electric lighting plant but it can use the plant only for purposes of public lighting It cannot sell to private consumers A strong demand has been made that the legislature authorize the city to engage in the commercial lighting business The best that could be secured was a provision in the act authorizing rate regulation purporting to confer upon the city the power to sell surplus electricity from its public plant but it is said to be doubtful if this clause in the law will prove of much practical value 693 I59The Annals of the American Academy The bills authorizing the Chicago city council to regulate the price of gas and electricity were bitterly opposed in the legislature by the gas and electric lighting interests The suggestion that the state create commissions to exercise this regulating authority in stead of vesting it in the city council was put forth by these interests in vain The telephone question has been much under discussion during the past two years The twenty year grant to the Chicago Tele phone Company in I889 expires next year Recently the city coun cil has passed an ordinance renewing the grant for another twenty year period but providing for possible municipal purchase at the end of ten years and at the end of fifteen years as well as at the date of termination of the grant This ordinance also calls for publicity in the affairs of the company It further provides that the rates shall be subject to regulation by the city council thirty months after the passage of the ordinance and at the end of every five year period thereafter The water plant in Chicago has been the property of the city for more than half a century Less important franchises such as those for switch track and other like privileges are commonly made for short terms only and of late years it has been customary to make all such grants subject to termination at any time The following section is the one that is usually incorporated in such grants The permission and authority herein given shall cease and determine ten Io years from and after the date of the passage of this ordinance or at any time prior thereto in the discretion of the mayor This ordinance shall at any time before the expiration thereof be subject to modification amendment or repeal and in case of repeal all privileges hereby granted shall thereupon cease and determine The municipal ownership sentiment has been strong in Chicago and three years ago Judge Edward F Dunne was elected mayor on the issue of immediate municipalization of street railways As a reactionary consequence of Mayor Dunnes weak administration the cause of immediate municipal ownership received a serious setback But it is my opinion that sentiment in Chicago for munic ipal ownership of public utilities when it can actually be brought about on proper terms is as strong as ever 694 I6o

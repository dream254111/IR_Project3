j100276,Michigan Law Review,1275526,The Economic and Legal Basis of Compulsory Industrial Insurance for Workmen II,i254469,THE ECONOMIC AND LEGAL BASIS OF COMPULSORY INDUSTRIAL INSURANCE FOR WORKMEN II IN Part I of this article it has been shown that the economic effect of the operation during the past centuries of the commonlaw remedies for compensating personal injuries has shown such remedies to be almost a total failure In Part II it is proposed to discuss the effect and the legal validity of the Ohio Industrial Insur ance Act of 9II1 which is founded not upon the commonlawrem edies but upon the German Industrial Insurance Law of 1884 which has been adopted in a more or less modified form in most European countries THE NATURE AND REMEDIAL PROVISIONS Of THE OHIIO INDUSTRIAL INSURANCE ACT ARE AS FOLLOWS I That every workman injured shall be compensatedi at the rate of 6623 per cent of his loss of wages for not longer than 300 weeks nor more than 1200 per week in case of death where there are dependents the compensation shall not be less than I50000 nor exceed 340000 plus doctor bills and funeral expenses to a maximum amount of 20000 and in no case shall the compensation exceed for any injury 340000 excepting in the case of total dis ability 2 That every employer of five or more persons shall pay into the State insurance fund the premium based upon the pay roll and hazard of his business sufficient to pay his pro rata share of the com pensation awarded to workmen against the fund 3 That every employer of five or more persons who fails to pay said premiums shall not avail himself of any of the socalled commonlaw defenses in case he is sued by a workman who is in jured while in his employ 4 That every workman is obliged to accept the compensation provided by the act in lieu of all rights and remedies heretofore ex isting excepting the case where he may be denied any relief what ever or where he may be injured through a willful act of the em ployer or through the employers violation of a statute or ordinance in which case he may elect to sue his employer at law or take under the compensation act  The constitutionality of this Act was unanimously upheld by the Supreme Court of Ohio in the case of State ex rel Yaple v Creamer Treasurer of State 85 Ohio St  97 N E 602 57 Ohio L Bul Supp 65MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW 5 That in case a workman covered by the act is totally dis abled he shall be compensated at the rate of 6623 per cent of his average weekly wage in no case at less than 5 per week nor at more than I2 per week and the compensation shall be paid as long as total disability lasts ANALYSIS OS THE RELATIONShIIP CREATED BETWEEN EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE AS A RESULT OF THE ENACTMENT OF AN INDUSTRIAL INSURANCE ACT FOR WORKMEN The distinction between the principles of law applicable on the one hand to the common law of torts and employers liability acts and on the other hand those applicable to industrial insurance or work mens compensation may be stated as follows The body of law involved in the law of torts and employers lia bility statutes pertains entirely to the redress of private wrongs In such instances liability results in the payment of damages to the em ployee intended to be commensurate with and to reimburse him for the injury suffered Such law has for its sole object and end the regulating of private rights that is the readjustment of relationship between individuals to reproduce the parity presumptively existing between them On the other hand the obligations of industrial insurance and workmens compensation accrue from contingencies not dependent upon or within the control of the parties and thus have no relation ship whatever to the conduct of the parties hence these obligations are not based upon wrongs It follows then that they must pertain to the subject of government regulations and are in the nature of economic provisions taking the form of indirect taxation levied te regulate occupations for on what other basis would the government be justified in writinginto the labor contract against the will of the parties an insurance policy Were this not so industrial insurance or workmens compensation would be free from the standpoint of both the employee and the employer without basis of justice or equity for the theory of such laws is that compensation is not to be commensurate with injury but is to be based upon wages thus sub stituting for the former obligations based upon tort which offered damages commensurate with injury a purely arbitrary sum Such a scheme can have no relation to the adjustment of private wrongs If it be justifiable it must be on the sociological theory of the right of the state to levy a tax for the purpose of protecting from an econom ic standpoint the community as a whole It therefore follows that in our analysis of constitutional limita tions we can not look for any analogy in the decisions which have to 438INDUSTRIAL INSURANCE FOR WORKMEN do with the regulation of the private relations between the employer and his employees However for this purpose there have been brought into the earlier stages of the discussions on this subject cases which hold a statute of Pennsylvania constitutional which abol ished the doctrine of respondeat superior in the cases of persons on or near railroads and not in the employ of the railroad company1 cases which hold statutes constitutional that make railroads liable for fires set by engines though without fault2 cases holding a statute constitutional making a railroad company liable for injury though without fault3 or the common illustrations as the liability of a mas ter for the acts of his servant or the ancient law of deodands or the liability of the husband for the tort of his wife All of the common law or statutory duties defined in these decisions relate to the preservation of private rights Our problem is therefore the following has the State the power to regulate its industries for the purpose of protecting the health safety and general welfare of the community by levying a tax in the form of an insurance obligation upon such industries for the benefit of all employees injured while employed in the same And assuming that the State has the right to levy such a tax may it in appropriating private rights for the benefit of the general wel fare take as a part of the same from the employee the right which belongs to him to compensate himself for his personal injury caused by the default of his employer by recovering damages from the latter The attributes limitations and scope of the taxing power Judge CooIEY states the extent of the taxing power as follows The power of taxation is an incident of sovereignty and is pos sessed by the government without being expressly conferred by the people It is a legislative power and when the people by their constitution create a department of government upon which they confer the power to make laws the power of taxation is conferred as part of the more general power4 Everything to which the legislative power extends may be the subject of taxation whether it be person or property or possession franchise or privilege or occupation or right Nothing but express constitutional limitation upon legislative authority can exclude any 1 See Kirby v Pennsylvania R Co 76 Pa 506 and Martin v Pittsburgh  L E R Co 203 U S 284 2

grasp of the taxing power if the legislature in its discretion shall at any time select it for revenue purposes and not only is the power unlimited in its reach as to subjects but in its very nature it acknowledges no limits and may be carried even to the extent of exhaustion and destruction thus becoming in its exercise a power to destroy If the power be threatened with abuse security must be found in the responsibility of the legislature that imposes the tax to the constituency which must pay it The judiciary can afford no redress against oppressive tax ation so long as the legislature in imposing it shall keep within the limits of legislative authority and violate no express provision of the constitution The necessity for imposing it addresses itself to the legislative discretion and it is or may be an urgent necessity which will admit of no property or other conflicting right in the citi zen while it remains unsatisfied But the taxing power is one that is subject to very distinct and positive limitations It is the first requisite of lawful taxation that the purpose for which it is laid shall be a public purpose The decision to lay a tax for a given purpose involves a legislative conclusion that the pur pose is one for which a tax may be laid in other words is a public purpose But the determination of the legislature on this question is not like its decision of ordinary questions of public policy conclu sive either on the other departments of the government or on the people The question what is and what is not a public purpose is one of law and though unquestionably the legislature has large dis cretion in selecting the object for which taxes shall be laid its de cision is not final In any case in which the legislature shall have clearly exceeded its authority in this regard and levied a tax for a purpose not public it is competent for any one who in person or property is affected by the tax to appeal to the courts for protec tion6 Notwithstanding the vast power which resides in the States to tax all taxation proceeds upon the theory that a corresponding bene fit returns to the individual taxed for the property which belonged to him and which was appropriated For example in the use of a gen eral tax collected for the general revenues of the State it is assumed that the State is suffered to make full and adequate return in the pro tection which the State gives to the individual life liberty and property and in the increase to the value of his possessions by the 5 Cooley Taxation p 82 Lane County v Oregon 7 Wall 7I 6 Cooley Taxation Ed 2 p 55 440INDUSTRIAL INSURANCE FOR WORKMEN uses to which the state applied the money contributed7 In the case of a tax which is levied for a special purpose this theory of return becomes emphasized so that for the purpose of determining the valid ity of the tax it becomes necessary to find an immediate specific benefit passing to the individual taxed In the words of Judge COOLEY Taxation and eminent domain indeed rest substantially on the same foundation as each implies the taking of private property for the public use on compensation made but the compensation is different in the two cases When taxation takes money for the public use the taxpayer receives or is supposed to receive his just compensation in the protection which government affords to life liberty and property in the increase in the value of possessions which comes from the use to which the gov ernment applies the money raised by the tax and these benefits amply support the individual burden8 Therefore the underlying principle of special taxation general taxation and eminent domain is one and the same namely that for the tax collected a return shall be given back to the individual whose property is appropriated The regulation of private rights for a public purpose under the police power is as much an appropriation of property as the direct taking of property under the taxing power Thus one of the powers of exercising the police power is to levy a tax for regulatize pur poses instead of for revenue Judge COOLEY in his work on Taxation says There are some cases in which levies are made and collected under the general des ignation of taxes or under some form employed in revenue laws to indicate a particular class of itaxes where the imposition of the bur den may fairly be referred to some other authority than to that branch of the sovereign power of the State under which the public revenues are apportioned and collected The reason is that the im position has not for its object the raising of revenue but looks rather to the regulation of relative rights privileges and duties as between individuals to the conservation of order in the political society to the encouragement of industry and the discouragement of pernicious employments Legislation for these purposes it would seem proper to look upon as being made in the exercise of that authority which is inherent in every sovereignty to make all such rules and regulations as are needful to secure and preserve the pub lic order and to protect each individual in the enjoyment of his own rights and privileges by requiring the observance of rules of order fairness and good neighborhood by all around him This manifes 7 Cooley Taxation Ed 2 p 3 8 Cooley Const Lim Ed 7 p 7I5 See also Scovill v Cleveland I Ohio St I26 441MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW tation of the sovereign authority is usually spoken of as the police power9 Industrial insurance would seem in part to come within the scope of regulative legislation since the fund necessary to be raised to protect the employed class must necessarily be created through the exercise of some form of the taxing power and moreover the primary object of such regulative legislation is to readjust relations between certain classes of society to the development of the public welfare Therefore in determining whether such legislation be constitutional or not one is confronted with the limitations placed by the Fifth Amendment upon the exercise of the police power by the State in the form of the taxing power What then is a public purpose from the standpoint of such regu lative legislation It must always be conceded that the proper authority to determine what should and what should not constitute a public burden is the legislative department of the State And in determining this ques tion the legislature cannot be held in any narrow or technical rule Not only are certain expenditures absolutely essential to the continu ed existence of the government and the performance of its ordinary functions but as a matter of policy it may sometimes be proper and wise to assume other burdens which rest entirely on considerations of honor gratitude or charity The officers of government must be paid the laxws printed roads constructed and public buildings erected but with a view to the general well being of society it may also be important that the children of the State should be educated the poor kept from starvation losses in the public service indemnified and incentives held out to the faithful and fearless discharge of duty in the future by the payment of pensions to those who have been faithful public servants in the past There will therefore be neces sary expenditures which rest upon considerations of policy only and in regard to the one as much as to the other the decision of that department to which alone questions of State policy are addressed must be accepted as conclusive Very strong language has been used by the courts in some of the cases on the subject In a case where was questioned the validity of the State law confirming township action which granted gratuities to persons enlisting in the military service of the United States the Supreme Court of Connecticut assigned the following reasons in support In the first place if it be conceded that it is not competent for 9 2 Cooley Taxation Ed 3 II25 442INDUSTRIAL INSURANCE FOR WORKM EN the legislative power to make a gift of the common property as of a sum of money to be raised by taxation where no possible public benefit direct or indirect can be derived therefrom such exercise of the legislative power must be of an extraordinary character to justi fy the interference of the judiciary and this is not the case Second If there be the least possibility that making the gift will be promotive in any degree of the public welfare it becomes a question of policy and not of natural justice and the determination of the legislature is conclusive And such is this case Such gifts to unfortunate classes of society as the indigent blind the deaf and dumb or insane or grants to particular colleges or schools or grants of pensions swords or other mementos for past service involving the general good indirectly and in slight degree are frequently made and never questioned9a It appears then that under the limitations under which the tax ing power may be exercised for public purposes a tax may be so levied which in fact could be used under appropriate limitations to insure workmen against injuries Finally it must be shown that where a tax is levied upon a special class for a special purpose some form of return must be traced to the class paying the same In the case of Southlwestern Oil Co v State of Texas10 the court holds that a State may tax all or it may tax one or more taking care to accord equal rights to all in the same class Speaking of the Four teenth Amendment the court says Nor does the amendment pro hibit special legislation Indeed the greater part of all legislation is special either in the extent to which it operates or the objects sought to be obtained by it In the case of Connelly v Union Sewer Pipe Co the court says A tax may be imposed upon certain callings and trades for when the State exerts its power to tax it is not bound to tax all pursuits or all property that may be legitimately taxed for governmental pur poses It would be an intolerable burden if a State could not tax any property or calling unless at the same time it taxed all property or all callings Its discretion in such matters is very great and should be exercised solely with reference to the general welfare as involved in the necessity of taxation for the support of the State A State may in its wisdom classify property for purposes of taxa tion and the exercise of its discretion is not to be questioned in a 9a Cooley Const Iim Ed 7 p 696 10 217 U S 114 and 123 11 184 U S 540 562 443MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW court of the United States so long as the classification does not in vade rights secured by the Constitution of the United States Industrial insurance as already ordered is a State regulation read justing the relations of employer and employe for the economic wel fare of the community For this purpose the State appropriates the property of the employer and gives it to the employe We have already seen that from a constitutional standpoint the status of the employer and employe cannot warrant such an appropriation In consequence if the principle above stated be correct there must be a specific benefit moving to the class taxed for otherwise no relation can be traced between it and the special purpose for which the funds realized are to be used In this instance the public good is sought not only in the adequate protection of the wage earning class but also in the prevention of the vast economic waste now arising from personal injury litigation Any law then which justifies the appro priation of private property for the public welfare in this respect must be so drawn as in fact to produce these desired results So far as the employe is concerned it is clear that for any rights of his so appropriated comes a return in the form of insurance compensation However in the scheme of industrial insurance no such direct bene fit is traceable to the employer It remains then that he be indirectly compensated in the only way possible if his property is to be taken specifically to be used to insure the employe class viz by appro priate protection against the present evils of litigation Thus one would surrender to the State a right of action for personal injury and receive insurance and the other would pay a tax in exchange for protection against litigation As a result each party would have received a peculiar benefit for the particular property interest in voluntarily surrendered by it to the common welfare The principles above stated have been laid down in those decisions of the court which pertain to the distribution of burdens where the interests of the public and individuals are blended in a common work or service imposed by law In the case of C C  A R Co v Gibbesl2 the Supreme Court says There are many instances where parties are compelled to perform certain acts and to bear certain expenses when the public is interested in the acts which are performed as much as the parties themselves Thus in opening widening and improving streets the owners of adjoining property are often compelled to bear the expenses or at least a portion of them notwithstanding the work done is chiefly 12 142 U S 386 394 444INDUSTRIAL INSURANCE FOR WORKMEN for the benefit of the public So also in the draining of marsh lands the public is directly interested in removing the causes of malaria and yet the expense of such labor is usually thrown upon the owners of the property Quarantine regulations are adopted for the pro tection of the public against the spread of disease yet the require ment that the vessel examined shall pay for the examination is a part of all quarantine systems Morgan v Louisiana ii8 U S 455 466 So the expense of a compulsory examination of a railroad en gineer to ascertain whether he is free from color blindness has been held tobe properly chargeable against the railroad company Nashzille C  St L R Co v Alabama 128 U S 96 ioI So where work is done in a particular county for the benefit of the public the cost is oftentimes cast upon the county itself in stead of upon the whole State Thus in M7obile County v Kim ball I02 U S 691 it was held that a provision for the issuing of bonds by a county in Alabama could not be invalid although it im posed upon one county the expense of an improvement in which the whole State was interested In such instances where the interests of the public and individuals are blended in any work or service imposed by law whether the cost shall be thrown entirely upon the individu als or upon the State or be apportioned between them is matter of legislative direction But the employers property can only be appropriated in the form of a tax to be used as industrial insurance upon the condition that the employer being so taxed obtain a peculiar benefit That is to say if As property be given to B under the guise of a tax for the public need then A must be put in a special class receiving a peculiar benefit in lieu of his appropriated property Under the Ohio law the employer is discharged from suit when he has made his contribution to the fund which complies with the foregoing principle In other words to levy this tax without giving A this benefit would be to appropriate his property without due process of law Thus to pass a law which would leave the employe the right to exercise the option as to whether he would accept the insurance or continue to exercise his present rights of action at law would so far as the question of benefits are concerned leave the employer class exactly where it is at present and would in consequence be the appropriation of his proper ty without due process of law for in such instance such a law would not only fail to regulate in an economic manner the relation between the employer and employe as desired but would also by reason of continuing the opportunity to sue under the present methods for personal injuries fail completely to carry out the sole public object 445MIICHIGAN LAW REVIET of socalled compensative legislation namely the economic wel fare of the community Legislation similar to the Ohio law is already well grounded or four distinct lines of cases in American jurisprudence al The bank depositors guarantee act cases b The sheepdog law cases c The cases which uphold laws taxing saloonkeepers for the purpose of creating a fund to be disbursed by a State commission in the erection and operation of a State asylum for inebriates d The cases which uphold statutes imposing a liability upon fire insurance agents of the nature of a tax based upon the amount of insurance effected by them for the benefit of a fund to care for and cure sick and injured firemen a The cases zuhicli stustain Bank Depositors Guliaranltee Acts The constitutionality of these laws was upheld in the Bank Guaran tee Cases13 in which Mr Justice HOLMES delivering the opinion of the court said This is a proceeding against the Governor of the State of Okla lhoma and other officials who constitute the State Banking Board to prevent them from levying and collecting an assessment from the plaintiff under an act approved December 17th I907 This act creates the Board and directs it to levy on every bank existing under the laws of the State an assessment of one per cent of the banks aver age daily deposits with certain deductions for the purpose of creat ing a Depositors Guaranty Fund There are provisos for keeqing up the fund and by an act passed Miarch I  I909 since the suit was begun the assessment is to be five per cent The purpose of the fund is shown by its name It is to secure the full repayment of deposits When a bank becomes insolvent and goes into the hands of the bank commissioner if its cash immediately available is not enough to pay depositors in full the banking board is to draw from the depositors guaranty fund and from additional assessments if required the amount needed to make up the deficiency   In answering that question we must be cautious about pressing the broad words of the I4th Amendment to a drily logical extreme Many laws which it would be vain to ask the court to overthrow could be shown easily enough to transgress a scholastic interpretation of one or another of the great guarantees in the Bill of Rights They more or less limit 13 Noble State Bank v Haskell 2I9 U S 104 Shallenberger Governor of the State of Nebraska v First

property to a certain extent VWe have few scientifically certain criteria of legislation and as it is often difficult to mark the line where what is called the police power of the States is limited by the Constitution of the United States judges should be slow to read into the latter a nolu 1ims rnutare as against the lawmaking power The substance of the plaintiffs argument is that the assessment takes private property for private use without compensation And while we should assume that the plaintiff would retain a reversionary interest in its contribution to the fund so as to be entitled to a return of what remained of it if the purpose were given up see Danby Bank v State Trealsurer 39 Vt 92 98 still there is no denying that by this law a portion of its property might be taken without return to pay debts of a failing rival in business Nevertheless notwithstand ing the logical form of the objection there are more powerful con siderations on the other side In the first place it is established by a series of cases that an ulterior public advantage may justify a com paritively insignificant taking of private property for what in its immediate purpose is a private use    And in the next it would seem that there may be other cases beside the every day one of taxation in which the share of each party in the benefit of a scheme of mutual protection is sufficient compensation for the cor relative burden that it is compelled to assume    At least if we have a case within the reasonable exercise of the police power as above explained no more need be said It may be said in a general way that the police power extends to all the great public needs Cam field v United Staites 167 U S 518 42 L ed 260 17 Sup Ct Rep 864 It may be put forth in aid of what is sanctioned by usage or held by the prevailing morality or strong and preponderant opinion to be greatly and immediately necessary to the public welfare b SheepDog Lawv Cases Many States notably Ohio Illinois Indiana Kentucky Michigan and Massachusetts exercising the police power for the promotion of the sheep industry and public welfare have enacted statutes im posing a tax or license upon dogs in a stated sum collecting the same from the owner placing the collections in a public fund and dis tributing the same through State officers in paying damages to own ers of sheep killed by dogs These statutes have been universally upheld by the courts The Ohio Act was attacked as being an unconstitutional exercise 447MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW of the taxing power of the State and an unreasonable exercise of the police power but the court sustaining the law said14 While the dog as a species possesses many valuable traits which by some are denominated virtues it is nevertheless known of all men that he possesses vicious traits whichl are especially inimical to the important industry of raising sheep and wool If the government were powerless to protect this industry from the ravages of dogs it would indeed be impotent to protect its citizens in the enjoyment of property than which none other is more essential to the public welfare But such power is unquestionably vested in the general assembly as a police power and in the judgment of the general as sembly a per capita tax on dogs has been deemed a means of securing the necessary protection to sheep owners and as the choice of means was within the power and discretion of the general assembly its judgment is not subject to judicial control The original statute on this subject which has been in substance transferred to Revised Statutes above quoted was entitled An Act for the protection of wool growers and the confiscation of dogs a subject not only within the police powers of the general assembly but one deserving of its consideration c Cases zwhich sustain an act to tax saloonists to create a fund for thec benefit of inebriates In State v Cassidyl5 the court sustained an act to establish a fund for the foundlation and maintenance of an asylum for inebriates requiring all sellers of liquors to pay ten dollars a year to the State treasurer through the county treasurers in addition to the usual license the fund to be disbursed by a State commission in the erec tion and operation of a State asylum for inebriates The court in its opinion points out that the act is an exercise of the police power upon a subject clearly within that power saying This act regards the traffic as one tending to produce intemper ance and as likely by reason thereof to entail upon the State the expense and burden of providing for a class of persons rendered incapable of selfsupport the evil influence of whose presence and example upon society is necessarily injurious to the public welfare and prosperity and therefore calls for such legislative interposi tion as will operate as a restraint upon the business and protect the community from the mischiefs evils and pecuniary burdens flowing from its prosecution    That these provisions unmistakably 14 Hoist v Roe 39 Ohio St 340 344 15 22 Minn 312 448INDUSTRIAL INSURANCE FOR WORKMEN partake of the nature of police regulations and are strictly of that character there can be no doubt nor can it be denied that their expediency or necessity is solely a legislative and not a judical ques tion    Regarding the law as a precautionary measure intended to operate as a wholesome restraint upon the traffic and as a pro tection to society against its consequent evils the exacted fee is not unreasonable in amount and the purpose to which it is devoted is strictly pertinent and appropriate It could not be questioned but that a reasonable sum imposed in the way of an indemnity to the State against the expense of maintaining a police force to supervise the conduct of those engaged in the business and to guard against the disorders and infractions of law occasioned by its prosecution would be a legitimate exercise of the police power and not open to the objection that it was a tax for the purpose of revenue and therefore unconstitutional Reclaiming the irebriate restoring him to society prepared again to discharge the duties of citizenship equally promotes the public welfare and tends to the accomplish ment of like beneficial results and it is difficult to see wherein the imposition of a reasonable license fee would be any the less a proper exercise of this power in the one case than in the other The purpose to which the license fund created by the act is designated is more consonant to the idea of regulating the traffic and preventing its evils than is the case under the general license law which devotes the fees received to common school purposes and we are not aware that any objection has ever been urged against that law on that ac count This case is cited with approval by Professor FREUND in his work on the Police Power Sec 623 d Cases which sustain acts which create a fund for the benefit of sick and inj d fired rmen Statutes imposing a liability upon fire insurance agents based upon the amount of the insurance effected by them for the benefit of a fund to care for and cure such sick and injured firemen have been upheld in the States of New York and Illinois Fire Depart ment v Noblel6 Each class of these four lines of cases is an example of the exer cise of the police power of the States to create a fund by taxation for the protection of the

more sacred than any other Rights of property which have been created by the common law cannot be taken away without due process but the law itself as a rule of conduct may be changed at the will or

Ohio Act of Uniform Operation upon Individuals  20I of the Act provides as follows Any employer who em ploys five or more workmen or operatives regularly in the same bus iness or in or about the same establishment who shall pay into the State insurance fund the premiums provided by this act shall not be liable to respond in damages at common law or by statute save as hereinafter provided for injuries or death of any such employee wherever occurring during the period covered by such premiums provided the injured employee has remained in his service with notice that his employer has paid into the State insurance fund the premiums provided by this act the continuation in the services of such employer with such notice shall be deemed a waiver by the em ployee of his right of action as aforesaid Each employer paying the premiums provided by this act into the State insurance fund shall post in conspicuous places about his place or places of business typewritten or printed notices stating the fact that he has made such payment and the same when so posted shall constitute sufficient notice to his employees of the fact that he has made such payment and of any subsequent payments he may make after such notices have been posted It is claimed that this Section is in violation of Article I Sec 2 of the Constitution of Ohio in that said act is not of uniform opera tion upon individuals in the State being limited to cover employ ments in which five or more persons are regularly employed That such a limitation is a reasonable exercise of the Police Power has been decided by abundance of authorities The United States Supreme Court in St Louis Consolidated Coal Co v Illi nois4 said Another question is whether the act as amended in 1897 in so far as it discriminates as to penalties imposed upon some persons engaged in the mining business and not upon others is a proper exercise of the police power It is true that the act of I897 amended the former law of 1895 by limiting its application to coal mines where more than five men are employed at any one time This is a species of classification which the legislature is at lib erty to adopt provided it be not wholly arbitrary or unreasonable as it was in Cotting v Kansas City Stock Yards Company 183 U S 79 in which an act defining what should constitute public stock yards and regulating all charges connected therewith was held to be uncon stitutional because it applied only to one particular company and not to other companies or corporations engaged in a like business in Kansas and thereby denied to that company the equal protection 24 I85 U S 203 452INDUSTRIAL INSURANCE FOR WORKMEIN of the laws In the case under consideration there is no attempt ar bitrarily to select one mine for inspection but only to assume that mines which are worked upon so small a scale as to require only five operatives v uld not be likely to need the careful inspection provided for the larger mines where the workings were carried on upon a larger scale or at a greater depth from the surface and where a much larger force would be necessary for their successful operation It is quite evident that a mine which is operated by only five men could scarcely have passed the experimental stage or that precautions necessary in the operation of coal mines of ordinary magnitude would be required in such cases There was clearly reasonable foundation for a discrimination here To the same effect is the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in McLean v Arkansas25 where the court held that it was not an unreasonable classification to divide coal mines into those where less than ten miners are employed and those where more than that number are employed and that a State police regu lation was not unconstitutional under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because only applicable to mines where more than ten miners are employed A similar classification was sustained by the same court in Wil liamns v Arkansas26 and in Engel v OMalley27 In Borgnis v Falk Co28 the Wisconsin Supreme Court unanimously sustained a like provision in the Wisconsin Compensation Act Does the Liability Board of Awards Exercise a Judicial Function In considering this proposition it is necessary to investigate the nature of the limitations created by the 5th Amendment to the Con stitution of the United States with respect to the provision due pro cess of law which is deemed to apply not only to the power of the legislative but also to the judicial branches of the State government The 5th Amendment reads No person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation The phrase due process of law has application in our problem not only to the rights created by the act but also rather to the rem edy provided by the act to make the putting into operation of the same effective The executive arm of every State government disposes of many 252II U S 539 21 217 U S 79 27 2I9 U S 129 28 133 N W 209 453MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW problems which considered by themselves are purely judicial in character This principle as the authorities show is illustrated in the following examples viz i In the levying of special assess ments 2 in the exercise of the power of eminent domain 3 in the collection of various taxes 4 in the adjudication of those con troversies of purely judicial nature which deal with questions of account between tax collectors and the State in which the State may finally determine all issues through its administrative agencies In the case of Murray v Hoboken Land  Improv Co29 Justice CUR TIS after referring to the summary methods used in England in the collection of taxes and in adjusting accounts of receivers of revenue says For though due process ol law generally implies and in cludes actor reus judex regularly allegations opportunity to answer and a trial according to some settled course of judicial proceedings    yet this is not universally true There may be and we have seen that there are cases under the law of England after Magna Charta and as it was brought to this country and acted on here in which process in its nature final issues agalinst the body lands and goods of certain public debtors without any such trial and this brings us to the question whether those provisions of the Constitu tion which relate to the judicial power are incompattible with these proceedings  That the auditing of the accounts of a receiver of public moneys may be in an enlarged sense a judicial act must be admitted So are all those administrative duties the performance of which involves an inquiry into the existence of facts and the application to them of rules of law    But it is not sufficient to bring such matters under the judicial power that they involve the exercise of judgment upon law and act CooLEY30 speaking of trial by jury in eminent domain cases cites the case of People v Smith3 and quotes from the decision as fol lows The constitutional provision securing a trial by jury in certain cases and that which declares that no citizen shall be de prived of his property without due process of law have no applica tion to the case The jury trial can only be claimed as a constitu tional right where the subject is judicial in its character The exer cise of the right of eminent domain stands on the same ground with the power of taxation Both are emanations of the lawmaking pow er They are the attributes of political sovereignty for the exercise of which the legislature is under no necessity to address itself to the 28 8 How 272 i5 L Ed 372 30 Cooley Const Lim Edi 7 p 778 312I N Y 595 454INDUSTRIAL INSURANCE FOR WORKMEN courts In imposing a tax or in appropriating the property of a cit izen or a class of citizens for a public purpose with a proper pro vision for compensation the legislative act is itself due process of law though it would not be if it should undertake to appropriate the property of one citizen for the use of another or to confiscate the property of one person or a class of persons or a particular de scription of property upon some view of public policy where it could not be said to be taken for a public use   It follows from these views that it is not necessary for the legislature in the exercise of the right of eminent domain either directly or indirectly through public officers or agents to invest the proceedings with the forms of substance of judicial process It may allow the owner to intervene and participate in the discussion before the officer or board to whom the power is given of determining whether the appropriation shall be made in a particular case or it may provide that the officers shall act upon their own views of propriety and duty without the aid of a forensic contest The appropriation of the property is an act of public administration and the form and manner of its performance is suich as the legislature shall in its discretion prescribe In respect to the levying and collection of taxes in a summary manner the court says in Kelly v Pittsburgh32 Taxes have not as a general rule in this country since its independence nor in Eng land before that time been collected by regular judicial proceedings The necessities of government the nature of the duty to be perform ed and the customary usages of the people have established a dif ferent procedure which in regard to that matter is and always has been due process of law In Palner v McMahon33 the court said  That amendment the I4th provides that no State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States nor shall any State deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor deny to any person with in its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws It is insisted that Palmer had no notice and no opportunity to be heard or to confront or crossexamine the witnesses for the taxing authorities or to sub poena witnesses in his own behialf and had not otherwise the pro tection afforded in a judicial trial upon the merits The phrase due process of law does not necessarily mean a judicial proceeding The nation from whom we inherit the phrase due process of law said this court speaking by Mr Justice MILLER has niever

provides for a mode of con firming or contesting the charge imposed with such notice to the person as is appropriate to the nature of the case the assessment cannot be said to deprive the owner of his property without due process of law    The imposition of taxes is in its nature ad ministrative and not judicial but assessors exercise quasijudicial powers in arriving at the value and opportunity to be heard should be and is given under all just systems of taxation according to value It is enoguh however if the law provides for a board of revision authorized to hear complaints respecting the justice of the assess ment and prescribes the time during which and the place where such complaints may be made These decisions show that controversies arising under the subject of taxation and eminent domain have no relation to judicial pro ceeding and in consequence due process of law does not require in such instances proceedings in a court of law unless the government consent Is the Employe Entitled to a Trial by Jury Mr Robert J Carey in his Brief on the Power of Congress in Respect of Industrial Insurance at page I37 has well summarized the principles involved in this proposition referring to the decisions of the Court in Parsonzs v Bedford34 and Knickerbocker Ins Co v Comstock3 But be this as it may we still think these decisions would not require trial by jury for the purpose of adjudicating a claim made by an employee against a government agency for the payment out of a tax fund of a stipulated sum alleged to be due such employee as insurance Such right so vested in the employee is not a new private right against his employer Thus it bears no resemblance to new substantive private rights akin to commonlaw rights though created by statute It is rather a right to share in a tax fund and thus is necessarily a claim against the government though the details of the law might be such that the claim is to be made against a gov ernment agency as for instance a bureau commission or associa tion The fund against which such claim is made is collected ad mittedly in a summary proceeding the right to an interest in such 4 3 Pet 433 7 L Ed 732 35 i6 Wall 258 21 L Ed 493 456INDUSTRIAL INSURANCE FOR WORKMEN 457 fund arises not for the purpose of recoupment in damages on ac count of a private wrong done the employee but solely because the employee being a victim of a prevalent evil is to be protected by the State as a member of a class of society The right indeed is in one respect akin to the right of a landowner in an eminent domain suit to compensation due him in lieu of his property appropriated In the present instance the employees chose in action against his employer for a personal wrong suffered is taken from him and in lieu of which he is paid a benefit for the appropriation of such right Under such circumstances even though a controversy arising over the payment of a fund take judicial form we think it within the power of the government to determine the character of the remedy The following cases are in point McElrath v United States I02 U S 426 26 L ed 189 Guthrie Nat Bank v Guthrie 73 U S 534 43 L ed 798 I9 Sup Ct Rep 51336 JAMES HARRINGTON BOYD TOLEDO OHIO 3 That there would be a legal basis for the establishment of Compulsory Industrial Insurance for Workmen in any of the provinces of the Dominion of Canada under the British North America Act is indicated in Kelly v Sulivan 2 Prince Edward Island Reports 34 18757 on appeal I Supreme Court Report of Canada 3 The Prince Edward Island Land Act of I875 was passed to convert the leasehold tenures into freehold estates upon terms just and equitable to the tenants as to the pro prietors for which purpose it provided a Commissioners Court by proceedings in which a compulsory transfer of the lands affected could be obtained In Kelly v Suli van the Supreme Court of the Island held that the Act came within Number 13 of Section 92 of the British North America Act as legislation on the property and civil rights in the province Peters J observes 2 P E I p 878 that if the provincial legislature were restricted to subjects coming within what American jurists call the right of eminent domain the act at least in some of its provisions would be an excess of legis lative power that no such public emergency or necessity existed as would justify the legis lative interference under the right of eminent domain in connection with which he quotes the following passage from Kents Commentaries I2th ed Vol 2 at p 340 It un doubtedly must rest as a general rule in the wisdom of the legislature to determine when public uses require the taking of private property but if they should take it for a purpose not of a public nature as if the legislature should take the property of A and give it to B or if they should vacate a grant of property or of a franchise under the pretext of some public use or service such cases would be gross abuse of their discre tion and fraudulent attacks on private right and the law would be clearly unconstitu tional and void The Act was sustained by both the courts Therefore the right of the provinces to enact legislation in Canada necessary to establish Compulsory Industrial Insurance for Workmen would seem to be unquestionably authorized under the British North America Act Number 13 of Section 92 For as in the case just cited the Pro vincial legislature might even disturb vested interests in real property if a pro vincial legislature thought that the peace order and good government of the province or Dominion required it

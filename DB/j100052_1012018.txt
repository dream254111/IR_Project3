J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1012018,THE COST OF LIVING FOR A WAGEEARNERS FAMILY IN NEW YORK CITY,I242633,THE COST OF LIVING FOR A WAGEEARNERS FAMILY IN NEW YORK CITY BY MRS LOUISE B MORE AUTHOR OF WAGEEARNERS BUDGETS DENVER COLO THE PROBLEM OF LIVING AS IT CONFRONTS THE CITY WAGEEARNER TODAY NOT ONLY CONCERNS THE WHOLE QUESTION OF WAGES AND LABOR BUT ALSO HOUSING CONDITIONS THE RENT PROBLEM THE COST OF FOOD AND FUEL HIS PLEASURE AND RECREATION THE EDUCATION OF HIS CHILDREN AND SOME PRO VISION FOR THE FUTURE THE STANDARDS OF A WORKINGMANS NEIGHBORHOOD RECOGNIZE THE WIFE AS THE FINANCIER OF THE FAMILY GROUP IT IS NOT AN UNATTAINED IDEAL BUT A REGULAR STANDARD OF RESPECTABILITY THAT A GOOD HUSBAND TURNS OVER TO HIS WIFE ALL HIS WAGES AND RECEIVES FROM HER 1 OR 2 A WEEK FOR HIS SPENDING MONEY  THE EARNINGS OF THE YOUNGER CHILDREN ALL GO TO THE MOTHER AND THE OLDER CHILDREN PAY BOARD TO HER FROM 3 TO 8 PER WEEK SHE IS THE MANAGER AND DISPENSER OF THE HOUSEHOLD INCOME AND PROVIDED THAT INCOME IS OF AVERAGE SIZE AND FAIRLY STEADY THE COMFORT OF THE ENTIRE FAMILY DEPENDS UPON HER CHAR ACTER AND ABILITY WITH NO DOMESTIC TRAINING THE AVERAGE WORKING GIRL GOES STRAIGHT FROM THE FACTORY STORE OR OFFICE TO START A NEW HOME SOMETIMES THE RESULTS ARE DEPLORABLE BUT GENERALLY THOUGH EXTRAV AGANT AND WASTEFUL AT FIRST THROUGH IGNORANCE AN INTELLIGENT AND HONEST WOMAN SOON WORKS OUT A SYSTEM OF HOUSEHOLD ECONOMY THAT IS SURPRISING IN MANY CASES AS WE ALL KNOW GOOD MANAGEMENT GOES FAR TOWARD MAKING ADEQUATE AN INCOME GENERALLY BELIEVED INSUFFICIENT FOR THE NECESSITIES OF LIFE A STUDY OF EXPENDITURES IN A WAGEEARNERS FAMILY IS THEREFORE LARGELY ONE OF THE HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT OF THE MOTHER A FEW YEARS AGO WHILE RESIDENT AT GREENWICH HOUSE A SOCIAL SETTLEMENT ON THE LOWER WEST SIDE OF NEW YORK CITY I HAD THE OPPOR TUNITY OF MAKING AN INTENSIVE STUDY OF THE INCOMES AND EXPENDITURES IN 200 WAGEEARNERS FAMILIES IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD RESIDENCE IN A SETTLEMENT GAVE AN UNUSUAL OPPORTUNITY TO KNOW PERSONALLY AND OFTEN INTIMATELY THE FAMILIES WHO WERE CAREFULLY SELECTED AS REPRESENTATIVE 104THE COST OF LIVING IN NEW YORK CITY OF DIFFERENT INCOMES AND NATIONALITIES I BELIEVE THAT MY ASSISTANTS AND I HAD THE CONFIDENCE AND FRIENDSHIP OF ALL THE WOMEN WHO GAVE US THIS INFORMATION THEY CO6PERATED INTELLIGENTLY AND FAITHFULLY IN KEEPING SIMPLE HOUSEHOLD BUDGETS OR IN MAKING CAREFUL VERIFIABLE STATEMENTS THEY WERE PROBABLY SOMEWHAT MORE INTELLIGENT THAN THE AVERAGE OF THE CLASS IN WHICH THEIR ECONOMIC LIFE IS CAST WHICH ENABLED THEM TO GIVE THE INVESTIGATORS A MORE ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF EXPEND ITURES IN WAGEEARNERS FAMILIES THAN LESS INTELLIGENT WOMEN COULD HAVE DONE THIS INQUIRY COVERED A PERIOD OF TWO YEARS AND THE RESULTS WERE COMPILED FOR ONE YEAR THE INCOMES FROM ALL SOURCES VARIED FROM LESS THAN 300 TO OVER 2000 A YEARBOTH OF THESE EXTREMES ARE EXCEP TIONAL BUT EACH REPRESENTS A CLASS ONLY 27 HAD INCOMES LESS THAN 500 A YEAR THE VERY POOR ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE NORMAL WORKING MANS FAMILY 57 HAD INCOMES OVER 1000 A YEAR THE LARGEST NUMBER 116 THEREFORE HAD INCOMES BETWEEN 500 AND 1000 A YEAR THE 47 MORE PROSPEROUS FAMILIES WHO WERE ABLE TO REPORT ANY SURPLUS AVERAGED 10437 ALMOST HALF THE FAMILIES CAME OUT EVEN AT THE END OF THE YEAR AND 55 FAMILIES HAD A DEFICIT MAKING THREEFOURTHS OR 75 PER CENT WHO WERE UNABLE TO MAKE ANY PROVISION FOR A RAINY DAY UNLESS INSURANCE IS CONSIDERED A FORM OF SAVING IT IS IN ONLY EXCEP TIONAL CASES THAT IT IS POSSIBLE FOR A CITY WORKINGMANS FAMILY OF AVER AGE SIZE AND INCOME TO MAKE MUCH PROVISION FOR THE FUTUREIN MANY CASES IT SEEMS ENTIRELY A QUESTION OF LUCK WHETHER THERE WILL BE A SUR PLUS OR DEFICIT THE AVERAGE HOUSEWIFE PLANS TO SPEND HER INCOME EACH WEEK AS CAREFULLY AS SHE CAN BUT SHE IS SELDOM ABLE TO PREPARE FOR A FUTURE SEASON OF UNEMPLOYMENT OR A TIME OF SICKNESS OR DEATH IF THESE CRISES COME THERE IS LIKELY TO BE AN INDEBTEDNESS OR DEPENDENCY OR AT BEST SHE MAY MANAGE TO COME OUT EVEN AT THE END OF THE YEAR IN ORDER TO ANALYZE THE COST OF LIVING FOR A CITY WAGEEARNERS FAMILY AN INCOME FROM ALL SOURCES OF 850 A YEAR MAY BE CHOSEN AS A REPRESENTATIVE ONE FOR A NORMAL FAMILY OF FIVE OR SIX PERSONS OTHER INVESTIGATIONS AS WELL AS MY OWN HAVE PLACED THIS AS A FAIR AVERAGE FOR WORKINGMENS FAMILIES IN A CITY LIKE NEW YORK IT IS A LITTLE ABOVE THE POINT WHERE THE AVERAGE FAMILY CEASES TO RUN IN DEBT I HAVE NO DESIRE TO PLACE THE INCOME AT THE LOWEST POINT POSSIBLE FOR THE MAINTE NANCE OF PURELY PHYSICAL EFFICIENCY BUT RATHER TO ALLOW ENOUGH MARGIN TO ENABLE A SELFRESPECTING FAMILY TO MAINTAIN A FAIR PHYSICAL AND MORAL STANDARD UNDER CITY CONDITIONS WHETHER THIS INCOME IS SUFFICIENT FOR SUCH 4 STANDARD I SHALL ENDEAVOR TO SHOW 105THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY A CAREFUL HOUSEWIFE WOULD PLAN DEFINITELY HOW TO SPEND THIS INCOME OF 1650 PER WEEK TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE ON THIS AMOUNT SOME FAMILIES LIVE COMFORTABLY OTHERS SUFFER PRIVATIONS OWING TO THE REGULARITY OF THE WEEKLY INCOME SIZE OF THE FAMILY AND CHARACTER AND AMOUNT OF THE EXPENDITURES IN THE ORDER OF THEIR IMPORTANCE ALL EXPENDITURES CAN BE GROUPED UNDER THE HEADS OF RENT FOOD CLOTHING LIGHT AND FUEL INSURANCE AND SUNDRIES FIRST OF ALL RENT AND FOOD ARE THE TWO ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY EXPEND ITURES MANY WOMEN PLAN TO KEEP THE RENT EQUAL TO THE WEEKLY INCOME OR ABOUT ONEFOURTH OF THE TOTAL EXPENDITURES THIS IS AN UNFORMULATED ECONOMIC IDEAL WITH THEM THE VERY POOR IN THE CITY MUST SPEND AS HIGH AS 30 OR 35 PER CENT OF THEIR INCOME FOR RENT THEY MOVE TO BETTER ROOMS AS THE INCOME INCREASES WHILE THE PERCENTAGE OF EXPENDITURES FOR RENT DECREASES THE AVERAGE RENT FOR 200 FAMILIES WAS 1350 A MONTH 194 PER CENT OF THE TOTAL EXPENDITURE CITY FAMILIES MOVE VERY FREQUENTLY EITHER TO BETTER THEMSELVES OR FOR LOWER RENTS AS RENTS ARE CONSTANTLY INCREASING THERE IS NO PERMA NENT HOME IN A CITY TENEMENT IN ORDER NOT TO BE OVERCROWDED THE EVILS OF WHICH IN HEALTH AND MORALS ARE APPARENT A NORMAL FAMILY OF THIS SIZE AND INCOME WOULD CONSIDER IT NECESSARY TO HAVE AN APARTMENT OF 3 OR 4 ROOMS FOR WHICH THEY WOULD PAY AT PRESENT RATES FROM 12 TO 16 OR 18 A MONTH A CONSERVATIVE EXPENDITURE FOR RENT WOULD BE 14 A MONTH OR 168 A YEAR THE FOOD FOR THE FAMILY MUST NEXT BE PROVIDED THE AMOUNT ESTIMATED BY DIETITIANS AS NECESSARY FOR FOOD VARIES FROM 1 A WEEK FOR EACH PERSON NOT AN INFANT TO 1 A DAY FOR FAMILIES OF MODERATE SIZE RECENT INVESTIGATORS PLACE AN EXPENDITURE OF 22 CENTS PER MAN PER DAY AS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR PHYSICAL EFFICIENCY AT CITY PRICES IN A FAMILY OF FATHER MOTHER AND THREE CHILDREN UNDER 14 YEARS OF AGE SAY 12 8 AND 3 THIS WOULD REQUIRE ABOUT 570 FOR A MINIMUM EXPENDITURE ACCORDING TO THE UNITED STATES BUREAU OF LABOR ESTI MATES OR 508 IF WE USE ATWATERS FACTORS IN ESTIMATING DIETARY STANDARDS THIS IMPLIES A SCIENTIFIC CARE IN THE SELECTION AND PREPA RATION OF FOOD WHICH IT IS UNFAIR TO EXPECT FROM A HOUSEWIFE IN A TYPICAL INDUSTRIAL FAMILY THE MOST ECONOMICAL EXPENDITURE FOR FOOD REQUIRES FAR MORE KNOWLEDGE THAN IS POSSESSED BY THE AVERAGE WOMAN ANY WHERE MALNUTRITION IS VERY PREVALENT IN CITY WAGEEARNERS FAMILIES DUE BOTH TO SMALL INCOMES AND TO IGNORANCE IN BUYING THE PROPER FOOD 106THE COST OF LIVING IN NEW YORK CITY OFTEN THERE IS ENOUGH FOOD BUT TO US A DEPRESSING LACK OF VARIETY YET COMPARED WITH THAT OF OTHER COUNTRIES IT IS GENERALLY AGREED THAT THE ORDINARY DIET OF THE AMERICAN WORKINGMANS FAMILY IS ABUNDANT AND VARIED FOREIGNERS BRING THEIR MACARONI BOLOGNA AND BEER OR POTA TOES AND TEA STANDARDS TO THIS COUNTRY BUT DIFFERENT CONDITIONS OF LABOR AND CLIMATE SOON MODIFY AND ENLARGE THIS DIET OR THE FAMILY REMAINS UNDERNOURISHED A DOLLAR A DAY WAS GENERALLY REGARDED BY THE WOMEN THEMSELVES AS AN ADEQUATE AMOUNT FOR FOOD FOR A FAMILY OF FIVE OR SIX IF WE HAVE ALL WE WANT THE WIVES OF CITY WAGEEARNERS ARE OFTEN CRITICISED FOR BUYING FOOD AND FUEL IN SMALL AMOUNTS FOR EXAMPLE POTATOES AND VEGETABLES BY THE QUART OR HALFQUART SUGAR AND FLOUR BY THE POUND TEA AND COFFEE BY THE QUARTERPOUND A SINGLE CARROT TURNIP OR ONION AND 1 CENTS WORTH OF SALT PEPPER VINEGAR ETC THIS HABIT IS OFTEN A NECESSITY BECAUSE OF LIMITED STORAGE FACILITIES AND OF ONLY ENOUGH MONEY FOR EACH DAYS NEEDS EVEN THE POORER HOUSEWIFE KNOWS WHAT GOOD BARGAINS ARE SHE KNOWS SHE COULD BUY SIX BARS OF SOAP OR THREE CANS OF TOMATOES FOR 25 CENTS BUTTER FOR 35 CENTS A POUND SUGAR 5 CENTS A POUND OR A BUSHEL OF POTATOES FOR 1 BUT SHE HAS TO DIVIDE HER MONEY SO CLOSELY THAT SHE CAN ONLY BUY ONE BAR OF SOAP AT 5 CENTS ONE CAN OF TOMATOES AT 10 CENTS A QUARTERPOUND OF BUTTER AT 9 CENTS HALFPOUND OF SUGAR FOR 3 CENTS AND ONE QUART OF POTATOES AT 10 CENTS 320 A BUSHEL SHE HAS LOST HEAVILY ON EVERY ONE OF THESE PURCHASES AND SHE KNOWS IT BUT HER PURSE MUST BE STRETCHED EACH WEEK TO COVER NOT ONLY FOOD BUT COAL AND GAS PERHAPS THE RENT THE INSURANCE A PAIR OF SHOES OR A NEW COAT FOR ONE OF THE CHILDREN TRULY THE DESTRUC TION OF THE POOR IS THEIR POVERTY MANY CAREFUL MANAGERS DO BUY THEIR GROCERIES FOR A WEEK ON PAYDAY NIGHT OR WATCH FOR SALES IN DEPART MENT STORES AND BUY IN QUANTITIES WHETHER THIS IS POSSIBLE ON AN ALLOWANCE OF 7 A WEEK FOR FOOD DEPENDS ENTIRELY UPON THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE HOUSEWIFE AND THE REGULARITY OF HER INCOME WHICH MAY VARY GREATLY FROM WEEK TO WEEK MAKING SUCH SYSTEMATIC BUYING IMPOSSIBLE IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT THE AVERAGE HOUSE WIFE ON THIS INCOME NEEDS TO CLOTHE HER FAMILY FAMILIES OF NEARLY THE SAME SIZE AND INCOME SPEND VERY DIFFERENT AMOUNTS ACCORDING TO THEIR STANDARDS OF LIVING AND THE SKILL OF THE MOTHER WHEN THE MOTHER CANNOT SEW THE CHEAPEST READYMADE CLOTHING MUST BE BOUGHT WHICH WEARS OUT QUICKLY AND IS OFTEN NOT WORTH REPAIRING THIS EXTRAVAGANCE ALMOST JUSTIFIES THE OTHER ALTERNATIVEBUYING BETTER 107THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY QUALITY ON INSTALLMENT MANY FAMILIES OF THIS GRADE HAVE CLOTHES GIVEN TO THEM BY FRIENDS AND RELATIVES OR BUY SECONDHAND CLOTHING MAKING ALL ALLOWANCES AND ITEMIZING THE ARTICLES AT THE PRICES PAID FOR THEM I BELIEVE 100 A YEAR SHOULD BE THE MINIMUM ALLOWANCE TO CLOTHE WARMLY AND DECENTLY AN AVERAGE FAMILY OF FIVE OR SIX IN THE CITY ALLOWING FOR SOME ATTRACTIVENESS AND A BETTER GRADE OF CLOTHES 120 A YEAR WOULD BE NECESSARY TO CLOTHE SUCH A FAMILY WITH THE STANDARDS DESIRABLE ON AN INCOME OF 850 THERE IS NO ITEM IN WHICH THE ECONOMY OR EXTRAVAGANCE OF A CITY HOUSEKEEPER SHOWS MORE QUICKLY THAN IN THE EXPENDITURE FOR HEAT AND LIGHT ONE WOMAN MAY BURN TWO BUSHELS OF COAL A DAY IN WINTER WHILE A CAREFUL HOUSEWIFE WITH THE SAME NUMBER OF ROOMS AND STOVES ONLY BURNS THREE OR FOUR BUSHELS A WEEK IN MOST CASES COAL LIKE FOOD IS BOUGHT IN SMALL QUANTITIES BY THE BUSHEL OR PAIL AND FOR THE SAME REASONS DURING THE TWO YEARS OF MY INVESTIGATION COAL COST 6 TO 650 A TON OR 25 CENTS A BUSHEL OR 10 CENTS A PAIL GAS IS BURNED BY THE QUARTERMETRE 25 CENTS FOR 250 CUBIC FEET WOOD FOR KINDLING AND SOMETIMES FOR FUEL IS FREQUENTLY GATHERED BY THE CHILDREN ON THE STREETS AND IS THEREFORE AN IRREGULAR EXPENSE THE TWENTYFIVE FAMILIES WITH INCOMES BETWEEN 800 AND 900 AVERAGED 4451 A YEAR FOR LIGHT AND FUEL SO THAT 40 IS A REASONABLE ALLOWANCE FOR A HOUSEWIFE TO HAVE IN ORDER TO HEAT AND LIGHT HER THREE OR FOUR SMALL ROOMS WITH ONLY ONE STOVE SO FAR WE HAVE ONLY CONSIDERED THE EXPENDITURES NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN A FAIRLY NORMAL PHYSICAL STANDARD ON AN INCOME OF 850 A YEAR THESE HAVE BEEN ESTIMATED AS FOOD 364 RENT 168 CLOTHING 100 LIGHT AND FUEL 40TOTAL 672 OR ALMOST 80 PER CENT OF THE INCOME THIS LEAVES ONLY 178 TO PROVIDE FOR SICKNESS AND DEATH IN THE FORM OF LIFE INSURANCE OR MEMBERSHIP IN BENEFIT SOCIETIES AND TO MAINTAIN WHAT MAY BE CALLED THE MORAL OR INTELLECTUAL STANDARD OF THE FAMILYTHE SOCALLED CULTURE WANTS OF THESE EXPENSES THAT FOR LIFE INSURANCE IS THE LARGEST AND THE MOST UNIVERSAL ONLY 26 OUT OF MY 200 FAMILIES DID NOT CARRY INSURANCE AND MOST OF THEM WERE VERY POOR OR SHIFTLESS AND IMPROVIDENT IT IS USUALLY THE INDUSTRIAL OR FRACTIONAL KIND FREQUENTLY CALLED WORKING MENS INSURANCE THE POLICIES ARE FROM 50 TO 300 AND 10 CENTS A WEEK OR MORE IS PAID FOR EACH MEMBER OF THE FAMILY THE USUAL AMOUNT PAID BY AN AVERAGE SIZE FAMILY WAS FROM 30 TO 40 THE AVER AGE AMOUNT IN FAMILIES WHO CARRIED INSURANCE BEING 3719 I FOUND 108THE COST OF LIVING IN NEW YORK CITY THIS EXPENDITURE AS HIGH AS 127 A YEAR WITH AN INCOME OF 1200 IN MANY FAMILIES THE AMOUNT CARRIED IS A REAL BURDEN INSURANCE KEEPS US POOR I HAVE FREQUENTLY BEEN TOLD AND YET THEY WILL BE DISPOS SESSED OR GO WITHOUT FOOD OR CLOTHING IN ORDER TO KEEP UP THE INSURANCE THE INSURANCE IS ALMOST INVARIABLY SPENT ON THE FUNERAL THE LARGER THE POLICY THE FINER THE FUNERAL UNDERTAKERS ARE OFTEN UN SCRUPULOUS OBTAIN POSSESSION OF THE POLICY AND MAKE THE COST OF THE FUNERAL EQUAL TO THE WHOLE AMOUNT OF THE INSURANCE WHERE THERE IS NO INSURANCE THE FAMILY IS PLUNGED INTO A DEBT WHICH IT TAKES YEARS TO REPAY IN SPITE OF THE BURDEN IT IS TO MANY AND THE EXCESSIVE RATE THAT IS PAID FOR THIS FORM OF INSURANCE THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THIS PROVI SION HAS BEEN MADE FOR SICKNESS OR DEATH FOSTERS A PRIDE AND A SPIRIT OF INDEPENDENCE AND A HORROR OF PAUPERISM AND BURIAL IN THE POTTERS FIELD THAT ARE COMMENDABLE THIRTYFIVE DOLLARS WOULD BE CONSIDERED BY OUR WAGEEARNERS FAMILY A FAIR AND NECESSARY PROVISION TO MAKE FOR INSURANCE THERE IS NOW ONLY 143 LEFT FOR ALL OTHER EXPENSES WHICH I HAVE CLASSED IN MY REPORT AS SUNDRIES THESE EXPENDITURES NATURALLY AND INVARIABLY INCREASE WITH THE INCOME I WILL VENTURE TO SUGGEST SOME OF THE EXPENDITURES WHICH A NORMAL FAMILY ON AN INCOME OF 850 WOULD CONSIDER ESSENTIAL TO THEIR HAPPINESS AND COMFORT I BASE THESE ESTI MATES ON MY KNOWLEDGE OF WAGEEARNERS STANDARDS AND ON THE AVER AGES FOR SIMILAR FAMILIES IN MY INVESTIGATION AND HAVE ENDEAVORED TO UNDERESTIMATE RATHER THAN OVERESTIMATE THEM GIVING THEM AS SUG GESTIONS NOT AS SCIENTIFICALLY PROVED FACTS THIS TYPICAL FAMILY WOULD PROBABLY BUY A PENNY PAPER SEVERAL TIMES A WEEK OR ONLY THE SUNDAY EDITION AND A FEW OF THE MORE POPULAR MAGAZINESIN ALL NOT MORE THAN 5 A YEAR FOR THIS PURPOSE FOR RECREATION SUMMER EXCURSIONS DANCES AND THEATRES THEY WOULD CONSIDER 20 A MODERATE ALLOWANCE FOR DRINK IF THEY OCCASIONALLY HAD A PINT OF BEER FOR SUPPER AND THE MAN WAS NOT A HARD DRINKER 20 WOULD BE A LOW ESTIMATE FOR FURNITURE KITCHEN UTENSILS ETC 15 WOULD BE A FAIR AVERAGE FOR CHURCH DUES 5 FOR SPENDING MONEY FOR THE FATHER 50 THIS WOULD INCLUDE SHAVING MONEY TOBACCO CARFARES TO WORK UNION DUES AND DRINK OUTSIDE THE HOME FOR OCCASIONAL SICKNESS 10 OR LESS DEPENDING HOW MUCH FREE DISPENSARIES AND HOS PITALS ARE USED AND FOR MISCELLANEOUS EXPENSES SUCH AS DOMESTIC SERVICE IN TIME OF SICKNESS SOAP AND WASHING MATERIALS WRITING PAPER 109THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY STAMPS MOVING EXPENSES ETC ANOTHER 18 WOULD SOON BE USED TOTAL FOR SUNDRIES 143 IF THERE WAS NO EXPENDITURE FOR DRINK IN THE FAMILY OUTSIDE OF THE MANS SPENDING MONEY AS WAS THE CASE IN MORE THAN HALF OF MY FAMILIES THAT ALLOWANCE COULD MOST ACCEPTABLY BE APPLIED ON MORE AND BETTER CLOTHING AND FURNITURE OR FOR THE EDU CATION OF THE CHILDREN IT WILL READILY BE SEEN THAT THESE ESTIMATES MAY OVERLAP BUT ON THE WHOLE I THINK IT WILL BE ADMITTED THAT THEY ARE BARELY ENOUGH TO MAKE LIFE WORTH LIVING FOR A NORMAL WORKINGMANS FAMILY THEY DO NOT ALLOW FOR MUCH EXPANSION OF THE SOUL OUR WAGEEARNERS FAMILY HAS SPENT EVERY CENT OF ITS INCOME NOTHING HAS BEEN SAVED AND NO ALLOWANCE HAS BEEN MADE FOR ANY EXCEPTIONAL EXPENSES SUCH AS CONTINUED ILLNESS NOR ANY PROVISION FOR A LONG PERIOD OF UNEMPLOYMENT NOR ANYTHING FOR THE EDUCATION OF THE CHILDREN AND AN INCOME WHICH DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR THESE THINGS AS WELL AS A MODERATE STANDARD OF COMFORT AND WELLBEING IS NOT SUFFI CIENT FOR A NORMAL WAGEEARNERS FAMILY THRIFT OR EXTRAVAGANCE MAY MODIFY THESE EXPENDITURES SOMEWHAT IN INDIVIDUAL CASES WE FIND THE CHARACTERISTIC GERMAN THRIFT ITALIAN ECONOMY IRISH LAVISHNESS AND AMERICAN EXTRAVAGANCE IF WE DEFINE THRIFT AS SAVING IN ORDER TO PROVIDE FOR FUTURE EASE OR EMERGENCIES IT IS FREQUENTLY IMPOSSIBLE IN THE AVERAGE WAGEEARNERS FAMILY WITH A VARIABLE INCOME A SYSTEM ATIC HOUSEKEEPER CAN NEVER GET AHEAD SHE MAY SET ASIDE 20 TO 100 DURING THE BUSY SEASON BUT IT MUST BE USED WHEN WORK IS SLACK AND INCOME IRREGULAR THERE IS A LIMIT OR DANGERLINE BELOW WHICH THIS KIND OF THRIFT IS A MENACE IT IS NOT THE RIGHT KIND OF THRIFT WHICH CROWDS SIX PERSONS IN TWO ROOMS OR TEN PERSONS IN THREE ROOMS IT IS NOT A WISE ECONOMY WHICH TENDS TO LOWER THE VITALITY OF ANY MEMBER OF THE FAMILY IN ORDER THAT PROVISION MAY BE MADE FOR THE FUTURE AS MR ROWNTREE SAYS THERE IS FREQUENTLY NO MARGIN FOR THRIFT MONEY SAVED MEANS NECESSARY FOOD FOREGONE  IF HOWEVER WE DEFINE THRIFT AS GOOD MANAGEMENT AS GETTING THE MOST FOR ONES MONEY AND AS LACK OF WASTE THEN IT IS AS HIGHLY DESIR ABLE AMONG WAGEEARNERS AS ELSEWHEREAND THANKS TO THE NATIVE INTELLIGENCE AND COMMONSENSE OF THE MOTHER IT IS FREQUENTLY FOUND TO MAKE ADEQUATE AN INCOME OTHERWISE INSUFFICIENT FOR THE NECESSITIES OF LIFE A SYMPATHETIC STUDY OF THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT OF CITY WAGEEARNERS WILL FIND AMONG THEM AN ENCOURAGING AMOUNT OF THIS KIND OF THRIFT 110THE COST OF LIVING IN NEW YORK CITY THESE FACTS ARE ONLY REPRESENTATIVE PERHAPS ONLY INDICATIVE OF THE SOCIAL ECONOMY OF WAGEEARNERS IT IS EVIDENT THAT MOST FAMILIES MUST LIVE FROM WEEK TO WEEK THAT THE AMOUNT OF COMFORT ATTAINABLE ON A GIVEN INCOME DEPENDS LARGELY UPON THE IDEALS AND AMBITIONS OF THE MOTHER BUT THAT EVEN A PROVIDENT AND CAPABLE HOUSEWIFE CAN MAKE VERY LITTLE PROVISION FOR THE FUTURE AND KEEP HER FAMILY IN HEALTH AND COMFORT UNLESS HER INCOME IS OF MODERATE SIZE AND FAIRLY STEADY HIGHER INCOMES WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN PRICES ARE DESIRABLE BUT BEYOND THE QUESTION OF WAGES AND INCOME IS THAT OF THE PRACTICAL AND DOMESTIC EDUCATION OF THE WOMEN IN WHOSE HANDS LIES THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN SPITE OF EDUCATIONAL AND INDUSTRIAL LIMITATIONS THOUSANDS OF WOMEN DO MANAGE ADMIRABLY BUT TO BRING EXPENDITURES DOWN TO AN IDEAL ECONOMY IS NOT WITHIN THE ABILITY AND TRAINING OF THE ORDINARY WAGEEARNERS WIFE IF THE NATIVE INTELLIGENCE AND AMBITION OF THE AVERAGE HOUSEWIFE COULD BE SUPPLE MENTED BY SYSTEMATIC AND UNIVERSAL INSTRUCTION IN MARKETING FOOD VALUES COOKING AND SEWING IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND CIVIC CENTERS THE INCREASED EFFICIENCY IN THEIR HOMES WOULD BE APPARENT IN EDUCA TION FOR HOUSEHOLD EFFICIENCY LIES ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MEANS OF BETTERING THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITION OF OUR CITY WAGEEARNERS 111

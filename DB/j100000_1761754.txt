j100000,Science,1761754,The ShipRailway between the Atlantic and Pacific,i300385,SCIENCE no evidence for or against the danger of using bad water The influences are felt principally by the weaker members of a community As regards the specific objections which may be raised to using the water of city wells it may be said in the first place that the evidence is pretty clear that water contaminated with sewage does at times give rise to low fevers Though it is difficult to furnish satisfactory proof of the statement that the use of contami nated water tends to lower the general condi tion of health of those who habitually use it those who have paid most attention to the sub ject unanimously agree that pure water is as important as pure air for the preservation of good health One of the chief dangers in the use of water contaminated with sewage is that by establishing connection between the sick and the well it contributes to the spread of some forms of epidemic disease As is well known it is now held by many of the highest authorities that in some diseases the organ isms which are believed to be the active causes are given off from the patients with the alvine discharges If now by any means these or ganisms or their germs are introduced into the system of a well person the diseased condition is set up What more efficient method of dis tributing these organisms than drinking water which is contaminated with the contents of cesspools  Exactly what forms of disease may be spread in this way it is difficult to say but there is strong evidence in favor of the view that typhoidfever and cholera are among them Over and over again outbreaks of ty phoidfever have been traced with practically absolute certainty to the use of water known to be contaminated by sewage In regard to cholera the evidence is quite sufficient to jus tify the destruction of all city wells IRA REMSEN TIE SHIPRAILWAY BETWEEN THE ATLANTIC AND PACIFIC THE article by Mir Hubbard in Science of Nov 4 1884 on canal routes between the Atlantic and Pacific discussed briefly the ad vantages of the three routes and methods pro posed The object of the present paper is to present the scientific and commercial reasons why the shiprailway across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec may be superior to either the Panama sealevel canal or the Nicaragua lock canal It is estimated that 50000000 will be ample to put the shiprailway into operation for the transportation of vessels of 5000 tons 33 The estimated cost of the Nicaragua canal on a cash basis is 140000000 and of that at Panama as high as 350000000 The route via Panama between Liverpool and San Francisco is about 700 miles longer than by Tehuantepec between New York and San Francisco about 1200 miles and between New Orleans and San Francisco about 2000 miles Probably 1000 miles excess of dis tance would be a fair average The time in transit across the isthmus would be at least three days shorter at Tehuantepec than at Nicaragua for either a steamer or sail ingvessel The Suez canal which is 100 miles in length delays a steamer 48 hours in transit or her passage is at the rate of about two miles per hour twothirds of the distance is through the lakes and there are no locks At Nica ragua about onesixth of the distance only is through an open lake and there will be from twelve to twenty locks at each of which a vessel will be detained nearly an hour The time required for passage therefore will be about four days so that although the total dis tance is shorter than at Panama the time re quired for a steamer would be about the same In the article by Mr Hubbard above referred to reference has already been made to the favorable situation of Tehuantepec with ref erence to the tradewinds It is also hoped that the maintenance will cost much less per annum than that of either canal The Panama canal being below the level of the sea with the slopes of its enor mous cuts exposed to the wash of the tropical rains the difficulty of removing the material washed into its prism and the controlling of the Chagres River make the maintaining of the shipchannel difficult and expensive At Nicaragua the conditions are nearly similar The shiprailway will not be subject at any point to the ravages of floods It will be built over its entire length on the solid ground with excellent materials at hand for construc tion and maintenance On either side is a natural harbor which with small expense by the construction of jetties will give two excel lent ports The climate is remarkably healthy and native labor abundant and cheap It is located in a country which has a comparatively strong government The estimated total cost of maintenance and operation in lifting hauling and placing the vessel with its cargo in the water again is less than thirty cents per ton of cargo carried The great doubt which must exist in the mind of the reader is in the practicability of lifting and hauling a loaded vessel The method JULY 10 188534 SCIENCE proposed is very briefly this to lift the vessel by an ordinary liftingdock distributing and equalizing completely the weight of the vessel by a system of hydraulic presses before the weight is brought upon the carriage which is to transport it This is all done under the water as the vessel rises out of it and in such a manner as to be perfectly safe and easy for the vessel The weight is finally placed upon the carriage in such a way that there is no more weight upon one wheel or upon one part of the carriage in its length or width than upon another The weight upon no wheel will be over eight or nine tons although they will be tested to twenty tons when manufactured The whole load is transferred to the wheels by means of powerful springs which will also be tested to twenty tons and none of which will have imposed upon them in practice a weight of over eight and a half or nine tons These springs not only give a perfect cushion for the vessel and carriage while being transported but also serve to take up any slight irregulari ties there may be in the track The system of supports designed and shown in the work ing model gives an area of support under the vessel from fifty to seventyfive times as great as that in the best liftingdock in the world and moreover these supports com pletely adjust themselves to the model of the vessel in each case As it has been said fre quently by practical experts in designing and building docks and handling vessels in them the desideratum is to have a sufficient number of adjustable supports and this has been sought for in the plans for the work as shown in the model The railway roadbed will be about 50 feet in width the width between the outer rails about 30 feet There will be six of these rails weighing from 100 to 125 pounds per lineal yard All six rails will be connected by a long steelplated tie set into two feet of broken stone ballast or concrete as the case may be The locomotive power as designed is to consist of engines of from 75 to 100 tons each of which will haul at least 3000 tons on a grade of as much as 40 feet to the mile so that two or at the most three such locomotives will haul the maximum load The grades are very light Much of the line of railway is practically level The maximum gradient of which there is only one length of about 12 miles is one per cent or 528 feet per mile The change between grades will be made by the ordinary vertical curve but a very flat one one that will change from a straight line two inches in 400 feet The railway is prac VOL VI No 127 tically straight the minimum radius being 20 miles The line as laid down on the isthmus has curves of from 20 to 53 miles radius At five points on the line in order to avoid heavy mountain cuttings or very high embankments a change of direction will be made by floating turntables  a simple and economical device in first cost and operation on which the vessels will be turned about while resting on a cushion of water The whole line has been very carefully surveyed and is practically located Careful examinations have been made to as certain the character of the foundations both for the roadbed and for the masonry structures The result of these examinations shows that there is no bad or even questionable ground anywhere between the two termini The ac companying map shows the topography of the country and the route of the railway the river to be navigated and the harbors on the two sides It will be seen from the foregoing that the vessel when lifted out of the water is really waterborne on a system of columns of water under pressure and that in the position given by this hydraulic system she is transported across the isthmus It will also be seen and appreciated by every person who is accustomed to travel on the ocean that the strain to the vessel by the methods proposed can never be so great as that which she must undergo every time she goes to sea E L CORTHELL THE WATERSUPPLY OF BRESLAU THE results of Hulwas numerous examinations of the waters of Breslau made during the years 187681 and which up to that time had appeared only in fragmentary official reports hardly obtainable even by specialists were brought together into a single paper on the occasion of the German health exhibi tion in 188283 This paper recently published is of great value to all interested in watersupply As far as the wellwaters are concerned the nu merical results are given only in selections and aver ages and are indeed mainly of local interest The story is essentially the same as may be told of any compactly built city especially of the older parts where the same houses have been occupied for hun dreds of years Of a hundred and fifty wells exam ined less than ten per cent furnished water really good enough to use and only two or three water which was above all suspicion Since the year 1871 Breslau has enjoyed a supply of water from the river Oder The works are situ ated above the city and the water is subjected to a thorough filtration through beds of sand and gravel Beitrdge zur schwemmkanalisation ulnd wasserversorgung der stadt Breslau Von Dr FRANZ IHULWA

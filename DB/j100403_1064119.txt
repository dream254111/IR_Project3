AND MU NICIPALITYA State statute empowered cities and towns to pass ordi nances regulating the sale of ardent spirits and to provide adequate penalties therefor provided that such penaltes be not less than those for similar offenses under the State statute The accused was tried and convicted upon a warrant issued by a city mayor Later he was indicted in the circuit court for the same offense He entered a plea of autrefois convict Held the plea should be sustained Bryan v Com monwealth Va 101 S E 316 The same act may and often does constitute separate and distinct offenses one punishable under a municipal ordinance and the other under a State statute Where this occurs a conviction in the munic ipal court is no bar to a prosecution in the State court Morris v State 18 Ga App 684 90 S E 361 So also a person acquitted of as sault and battery in a State court cannot plead autrefois acquit to a prosecution for disorderly conduct under a municipal ordinance Mc Rea v The Mayor 59 Ga 168 27 Am Rep 390 In one case a munic ipal ordinance punished the selling of intoxicating drinks on Sunday with a fine The State statute provided for this same penalty and also an additional fine for each drink sold It was held that a conviction under the municipal ordinance was no bar to a prosecution under the State statute Morganstern v Commonwealth 94 Va 787 26 S E 402 Some courts have gone to the extent of holding that even though the same act constitutes the same offense and is punishable by the same penalty under both the municipal ordinance and under the State stat ute still a conviction or acquittal under one will not bar a prosecu tion under the other State v Clifford 45 La App 980 13 South 281 The courts that take this view contend that the State holds the same relation to the municipality as any sovereign State holds to another and that therefore an act violating the laws of both is punishable by both See Greenwood v State 6 Baxt Tenn 567 32 Am Rep 539 But this analogy is false since the municipality is but an arm or agent of the State The rule on reason and principle which is supported by substantial authority seems to be that where the same act constitutes the same offense against the municipality as against the State an ac quittal or conviction by the courts of one will bar a prosecution by the courts of the other Lynch v Commonwealth 18 Ky Law Rep 135 35 S W 264 See also Morganstern v Colmmonwealth supra Howell v State 13 Ga App 74 78 S E 859 Under this rule the test as laid down to determine the validity of the plea of former jeopardy is to ascertain whether the ordinance of the municipality can be violated where some essential ingredient necessary to constitute the offense under the State law is lacking from the act punished under the mu nicipal ordinance or some additional ingredient is included See Mor ris v State supra Thus where a person is indicted under a State stat 372RECENT DECISIONS 373 ute for being drunk and boisterous and thereby disturbing the pub lic he cannot plead former conviction under a municipal ordinance which provides for the punishment of any person whether intoxicated or not who becomes so boisterous or disorderly as to disturb the pub lic Morris v State supra Where however a State statute confers upon municipal officers jurisdiction to try offenses against the State it makes such officers officers of the State for the trial of these offenses and such a case is not analogous to the trial for a mere violation of a city ordinance See Brooke v State 155 Ala 78 46 South 491 And under a statute providing that a conviction before any police or mayors court in any city or town shall be a bar to further prosecution before a justice of the peace for such offenses and for any misdemeanor embraced in the act committed it was held that a conviction in a mayors court would bar a prosecution before a justice of the peace although the mu nicipal ordinance did not provide the same penalty as the State statute prescribed Richardson v State 56 Ark 367 19 S W 1052 In the instant case the court held that the legislature by providing that the penalty under the municipal ordinance should not be less than that under the State statute intended that a violation of both by the same act would constitute but one offense and therefore the plea of former jeopardy should be sustained EQUITYINJUNCTIONMULTIPLICITY OF SUITS IN JUSTICES COURT WITH OUT MERITORIOUS CAUSEA number of separate suits based upon the same alleged wrongful act and to which the same defense would apply were insti tuted against the appellants in a justices court These suits were with out merit and the damages claimed were placed just below the amount that would permit the appellants to appeal The appellants brought suit to enjoin the appellees from further prosecuting their suits sepa rately in a justices court and further to require appellees to implead their separate causes of action and to determine all issues between the parties in the suit brought by appellants Held the injunction is granted Houston Heights Water  Light Assn v Gerlach Texas 216 S W 634 Under ordinary circumstances the fact that a number of persons have separate and distinct rights of action arising out of the same transac tion of a similar character and against the same defendant does not interfere with the individual right and privilege of such persons to prosecute their suits separately to a conclusion See Illinois etc R Co v Baker 155 Ky 512 159 S W 1169 49 L R A N S 496 Modern decisions however with few exceptions seem to uphold the doctrine that equity has jurisdiction to enjoin plaintiffs from bringing separate suits where the cases arise from the same common cause are governed by the same legal principle and involve similar facts The injunction is granted to prevent a multiplicity of suits See 1 POMEROY EQUITY JURISPRUDENCE 3rd ed  245 and cases cited in footnotes In the instant case the injunction was granted merely to prevent a multiplicity of suits even though the claims asserted were valid and meritorious Houston Heights Water  Light Assn v Gerlach supra

FALSE SINCE THE MUNICIPALITY IS BUT AN ARM OR AGENT OF THE STATE THE RULE ON REASON AND PRINCIPLE WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY SUBSTANTIAL AUTHORITY SEEMS TO BE THAT WHERE THE SAME ACT CONSTITUTES THE SAME

AS TO DISTURB THE PUB LIC MORRIS V STATE SUPRA WHERE HOWEVER A STATE STATUTE CONFERS UPON MUNICIPAL OFFICERS JURISDICTION TO TRY OFFENSES AGAINST THE STATE IT MAKES SUCH OFFICERS OFFICERS OF THE STATE FOR THE TRIAL OF THESE OFFENSES AND SUCH A CASE IS NOT ANALOGOUS TO THE TRIAL FOR A MERE VIOLATION OF A CITY ORDINANCE SEE BROOKE V STATE 155 ALA 78 46 SOUTH 491 AND UNDER A STATUTE PROVIDING THAT A CONVICTION BEFORE ANY POLICE OR MAYORS COURT IN ANY CITY OR TOWN SHALL BE A BAR TO FURTHER PROSECUTION BEFORE A JUSTICE OF THE PEACE FOR SUCH OFFENSES AND FOR ANY MISDEMEANOR EMBRACED IN THE ACT

equity to authorize railroad receivers to issue certificates having priority over existing mortgages is now well established Kneeland v American Loan  Trust Co 136 U S 89 Bank of Commerce v Cen tral Coal  Coke Co 115 Fed Rep 878 C C A Eighth Circ The limits of that power however have not yet been fixed and there has been an alarming tendency to juggle interests and rights without due regard for the bondholders The decision of a recent case emphasizing the need of caution in the exercise of this extraordinary right is a welcome check Certificates were issued to com plete a road only onethird built and later a second series was issued with priority over the first the result being sure loss to the first mortgagees and only conjectural benefit to the other creditors The Court of Appeals in reversing the ruling of the lower court well said  The appointment of a receiver vested in the court no absolute power over the property and no general authority to displace vested contract liens Bibber White Co v White River etc Co 115 Fed Rep 786 C C A Second Circ The subordination of existing mortgages and prior liens to liens for running expenses is justified under the plea of necessity rather than defended on prin ciple The argument is twofold The peculiar nature of the corporate business makes it imperative that the railroad should be kept running if the property is to be preserved Loans for this purpose can be secured only by granting priority of lien and thus this power though dangerous is necessary for the ultimate pro tection of even the bondholders The same reasoning shows that the stock holders and the other creditors will often have to depend on such action by the court as their only hope of relief Again it is urged that the court in charge of the railroad must continue it in operation to enable it to fulfill its obligations to the public It would seem that both these reasons or at least the first should exist in any given case before the vested rights of the mortgagees should be dis placed It is on the element of public duty however that the chief emphasis has been laid and consequently the doctrine has not been applied to private corporations owing no such duty Baltimore etc v Alderson 32 C C A 542 On the other hand probable loss to the mortgagees has not always been thought a fatal objection when the public welfare was concerned Ellis v Vernon Ice etc Co 4 Tex Civ App 66 see 7 Harv L Rev 375 The arguments based on the interest of the public and on the probable ultimate benefit of all the par ties interested lead on to an indefinite extension of the doctrine and the danger lies in the lack of a fixed limit This is shown in cases where the courts have considered it their duty to complete unfinished roads Miltenberger v Logans port By Co 106 U S 286 The action of the lower court in the principal case is the most extreme instance of this danger It is conceded that the bondholders have a right to be notified so that they may appear and argue against the issue of the certificates But that precaution helps little if the test is to be not their interest but that of the public It is claimed that in extending credit to the railroad they have taken the risk of the issue of certificates with the consequent1902 MISCELLANY 519 postponement of their liens But it is unjust to force them to take the chance of arbitrary action The question before the court in each case should be not a balancing of benefits to see whether the gains will be greater than the losses to all concerned treating all on an equal footing but whether the probable protec tion of the bondholders and the benefit to the other interested parties and to the public require and justify interference with vested rights otherwise sacred Harvard Law Review PUBLICATION OF PHOTOGRAPH As Ax ADVERTISEM TIn the present number of this Review Judge OBrien of the New York Court of Appeals de fends the decision of that court denying any remedy so long as the publication is not libellous to a girl whose photograph had been used as an advertisement without her consent Roberson v Folding Bbx O 171 N Y 538 When the defendants demurrer was overruled in the lower court 64 App Div 30 we commended the decision see 1 Caolumbia Law Review 591 and with due deference to the learned judge are still inclined to the same view The feeling that everyone has a right to a certain amount of privacy in hia life is widespread As to the extent of the right however this feeling is very indefinite A right as extensive as that said by Chief Judge Parker to have been claimed in the Roberson case a  right to pass through this world if a man wills without having his picture published his business enterprises discussed his successful experiments written up for the benefit of others or his eccentrici ties commented upon would be more than the public would admit It would be a very unsocial right Everyone claims an antagonistic right to know some things about his fellows things which are important for him to know politically or in connection with business and other things which interest him with merely a human interest The line between the things which the individual has a right to keep to himself and those in which society may have a legitimate interest is yet to be drawn it is a question of conflicting claims and public opinion has not settled whether a newspaper has a right to print an account of a wedding with a picture of the bride and whether one private citizen can take a snapshot photograph of another for his own amusement But there is a great difference between publishing a persons photograph for the satisfaction of social curiosity and publishing it as an advertisement In the former case privacyconflicts with a social claim a right akin to freedom of thought and speech in the latter privacy is made to yield to the claim of another individual to make commercial profit This difference is the founda tion of the prevailing public belief that in the Robersn case there was a right invaded whether the courts recognized such a right or not There being an injury is there any remedy or is the law at fault The Court of Appeals has taken the latter view suggesting remedial legislation The reasons for refusing a remedy are that otherwise a flood of litigation would ensue and that a court of equity has no jurisdiction except where property is concerned The first objection would be considerable if a decision for the plaintiff would have established an indefinite right of privacy a general right to be let alone But that result would not necessarily follow because the present case rests on narrower principles as already shown In regard to the second point if a property basis really is necessary for equity jurisdiction it is no great520 8 VIRGIrIA LAW REGISTER Nov stretch of legal ideas to say that everyone has a property right in his own form as was urged by Rumsey J in the lower court Its value as property is proved by the use made of it in the case in hand When the description of property kept in private is an invasion of the owners property rights Prince Albert v Strange 1849 2 DeG  Sm 652 1 McN  G 25 the reproduction of a persons features for advertisement would seem no less so But it may even be questioned whether a property basis is necessary In reading Gee v Pritehard 1818 2 Swanst 402 and Prince Albert v Strantge supra one cannot but feel that the real object of the courts in granting as well as of the plaintiff in asking the injunctions was to protect privacy and the use of property rights as a ground of jurisdiction was merely a fiction  Privacy is the right invaded said Lord Chancellor Cottenham 1 McN  G 47 and the right of preventing publica tion altogether was considered at least as important as the right to the profits of publication It would not be a greater step than has been taken at other times to cast off the fiction of protecting property and in terms protect the more personal right The conservatism of the decision expresses the courts belief that society has reached a state where law must progress by legislation but the general adverse criticism it has received indicates an opposing belief in Sir Henry Maines gen eralization that between the periods of fiction and legislation there is another agency in the growth of the law namely equityCOolumbia Law Review

f may be substituted for OE and OE A very similar solution which need not be given here can be obtained for the cases where one focus lies between Q and F or F and the other on QE or QE produced and which result in virtual instead of real images This equation applies to the refraction at one lens surface For simple lenses or for lens systems two or more equations according to the number of refractions must be com bined When the cone of light is narrow and does not diverge far from the optical axis the last factor cos acos b becomes practically 1 This produces the simplest form of the equation It can be used in calculating the foci of thick lenses in case the aberrations are neglected For the study of aberration the angles a and b can be calculated by solving the two triangles EDO and QDO in which EO and QO remain constant and the other sides vary according to the refractive index of the color of the ray of light investigated in the study of the chromatic aberration or according to the posi tion of Q when studying spherical aberration The usual equation found in the books can not be employed for either of the foregoing calculations when more than approximate re sults are required 0 W WOODWORTH ANTHROPOLOGY AT THE WASHING TON MEETING II A New Type of Ruin Recently Excavated in the Mesa Verde National Park Colorado J WALTER FEWKES An account of the excavation and repair of a new type of ruin on the point of a mesa opposite Oliff Palace conducted under the auspices of the Interior Department and the Bureau of American Ethnology Before the work was begun the exist ence of a large building was indicated by a large mound the surface of which was strewn with artificially fashioned stones partly covered with soil with a few feet of wall ishowing at one point On top of the mound at a place found later to indicate the highest wall grew a large cedar tree 825 a crosssection of which revealed 360 annual rings The building excavated is Dshaped measuring 122 feet on the straight side and 64 feet broad The standing walls now contain 120000 cubic feet The facing of the walls is artificially pecked with stone implements and in many instances rubbed smooth Many stones set in the walls or found in the d6bris bear incised ornamentation the begin ning of mural embellishment The masonry is not only among the best in any prehistoric building north of Mexico but the building itself is the most mysterious yet brought to light in our south west There are evidences that it was neither com pleted nor inhabited and evidently it was not in tended for habitation Its groundplan exhibits a unity in design and a strict adherence to that plan throughbut the construction of the building It is believed to have been constructed by the neigh boring cliffdwellers it is prehistoric and regarded as more modern than Cliff Palace A fossil leaf of a palm in relief on the upper surface of the cornerstone at the western end of the building is believed to be a sun symbol and the walls about it a solar shrine The building is regarded as a sun temple of the neighboring cliffdwellers and is the first of its type yet excavated in the Mesa Verde National Park The Passing of the Indian JAMES MOONEY The subject of the aboriginal population of America and more particularly of the United States at the first coming of the white man has been a matter of much speculation but of very little detailed investigation There has been about as much error and loose statement on one side as on the other some theorists claiming for the pre Columbian period a dense population for which there is no evidence in fact while others largely those interested in various civilizing schemes maintain that the Indian has held his own or is even actually increasing The claim for a dense earlier population is based chiefly on ignorance of Indian living habit and the error of assuming as contemporaneous in occupancy settlement remains belonging to widely separated periods The argu ment for stability or increase of the Indian popu lation rests in part on the error of beginning the calculation with the beginning of federal relations with the tribes ignoring the centuries of coloniza tion and disturbance which preceded that period and is also colored to some extent by a desire to draw good results from philanthropic and civilizing effortsN S VOL XLIII No 1119 Another source of confusion in this direction is in the improper designation as Indian for ad ministrative purposes of any individual who can establish even the most remote and diluted Indian ancestry Thus we have upon the official rolls and thereby legally entitled to full Indian rights thousands of persons whose pedigrees show one thirtysecond onesixtyfourth or even less of In dian blood We need an official or at least an ethnologic definition of an Indian based on the actual proportion of Indian blood In a detailed study of past and present Indian population of the United States and northern territories under taken for the Bureau of American Ethnology Mr Mooney arrives at the conclusion that the entire Indian population north of Mexico at the period of earliest white occupancy was approximately 1140000 of whom about 860000 were within the present limits of the United States The total number has been reduced by about two thirds through disease famine and war consequent on the advent of the white man Indian Missions in North America J F X O CONOR Indian missions were established in various states of North America during two hundred and fifty years from 1613 to 1776 and from that date to 1893 The Indian tribes evangelized during that period were the Abnakis and the Iroquois the Ottawas Illinois Mohawks the Hurons Onon dagas the Oneidas Cayugas Senecas Seminoles the Neuter Nation and the Algonquins the Kas kaskias the Natchez tribe the Yazoos the Sioux the Chickasaws and the Nezperces the Coeur dAlenes and the Miamis the Alabamas and the Susquehannas The Jesuit missionaries visited all these tribes and among many built churches mis sion houses and schools They lived with the In dians traveled with them taught them and strove in every way to bring to them the advantages of Christianity and civilization They traversed every section of that territory now the United States from Maine to California and from the Great Lakes to Florida These Indian missions were connected with the discovery of the falls and river of Niagara the discovery of the Mississippi by Marquette and of Lake George and the salt mines of Syracuse The records of these earlier missionaries are the most authentic and reliable accounts of the early days of America and of the lives customs occupations character in peace and war of the Indian tribes of North America Volumes have been written by the missionaries on the lives and habits of the North American In dian and the earlier valuable editions have been republished in the monumental series of the Jesuit Relations or Histories of the Indian Missions by R Goldthwaites secretary of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin Recent Developments in the Study of Indian Musio FRANCES DENSMORE The study of many sciences is dependent to some extent on mechanical aid and the progress of such sciences is measured by the invention or adaptation of such aids The invention of the phonograph and its recording apparatus marked an epoch in the study of Indian music It seems probable that the next epochmarking invention bearing on this study will be that of a device for accurately measuring small intervals of tone The musical system in use among civilized peo ples contains certain fundamental principles among them being a the importance of the key note octave and dominant of the scale and b the use of a unit of rhythm A melodic and rhythmic analysis of six hundred Indian songs Chippewa and Sioux shows that the same funda mental principles underlie the structure of a ma jority of these songs The interval of the minor third characterizes the folksongs of certain European peoples some of the ancient music of the white race and the songs of many uncivilized tribes Analysis of the above mentioned Indian songs shows that a the minor third is the interval of most frequent occurrence and b the average interval in these songs com prises 31 semitones which is approximately the number of semitones contained in a minor third Besides the studies mentioned tests of tone per ception were made among Chippewa and Sioux Indians with interesting results The Beaver Indians P E GODDARD The Beaver have hitherto received little or no attention from ethnologists They live in the Peace River district in northern Alberta with bands of Cree separating them from the Plains area Life seems to have been simple in that re gion consisting mainly in a severe struggle for food They depended largely on hunting and trapping resorting to fishing only in the lack of other food By means of caches transportation was avoided as much as possible Religious life while simple and devoid of elaborate ceremonies was emotionally strong The Beaver fall in with the Slavey and Chipewyan in other particulars 826 SCIENCEJUNE 9 1916 SCIENCE besides language Their only connections with their linguistic relatives to the south the Sarsi seems to have been only recent The Growth of the Tsimshian Phratries C M BARBEAU In nine unfederated tribes of the Tsimshian proper the phratries were unevenly represented Evidence shows that the structure and distribu tion of the four phratries have undergone consid erable change in recent times The phratries as they now stand consist of clans either grown out of each other or introduced from outside and in corporated mostly on account of political circum stances The HuronWyandot Clans C M BARBEAU The exogamic and totemic clans of the Huron Wyandots are at the basis of their social struc ture At least two out of eleven clans are mod erg and confined to one section of the tribe The remaining nine clans seem once to have been grouped into two opposite phratries with one odd clan but the evidence to this effect is slender The grouping of clans within such phratries must have been largely accidental and of comparatively short duration since there is barely any record bearing on their existence and practically no sur vival Herb Medicine Practises of the Northeastern Al gonkins FRANK G SPECK This paper presents lists of plants used in the medicine practises of several eastern Algonkin tribesthe Montagnais Penobscot and Mohegan Practically devoid of ceremonial associations in this area the pseudoscientific use of herbs by the northeastern tribes is taken as another indication of the primitive character of their culture As suming that a simple herbalism unmodified by ritual is more elementary than where subordinated to ceremonial practises the author brings forth another reason for regarding the northeast as a region where a fundamentally characteristic type of Algonkian culture has survived unmodified by contact with outside and more advanced types The associations of color taste name and the like are shown to underlie the remedies and their func tions in most cases as appears in the botanical identifications and the analyses of native names The Social Significance of the Creek Confederacy JOHN R SWANTON The Creek confederacy was a result of those social linkings from which in all parts of the world nationalities and governments have arisen 827 Although it originated among peoples related by language and bound together by similar customs and a similar economic life the constituent parts had themselves been subjected to still earlier uni fying tendencies as is evidenced by their clan sys tems and to some extent by their known history Their gradual consolidation was in accordance with a certain plan having both social and relig ious aspects a plan itself probably evolved pro gressively with the organization It had a relig ious seal in the shape of a myth in which a super natural origin and character were attributed to it As with similar complexes elsewhere some of which have been brought about more rapidly the Creek organization resulted from a progressive sur rendering of cultural religious and governmental independence by the several parts and approxima tion toward a typical mean The relation of the various incorporated tribes towns and clans to each other and to the entire body the dual division of towns and of clans and the method of sharing out the functions of the collective body all bear wit ness to this evolution and furnish material for comparison with the development of social bodies in other parts of the world Notes on the Sign Language of the Plains In dians HUGH L SCOTT After referring briefly to the development and communication of the languages in general and of the American languages in particular the author treats of the language of signs employed by divers indigenous tribes which inhabit the region extend ing from the Mississippi River to the Rocky Moun tains and from the Saskatchewan River in British Columbia to the frontiers of Mexico He also refers briefly to the principal dialects of the American Indians and to the fact that these dia lects served as an international vehicle of com munication With respect to the language of signs the au thor demonstrates that it is one of the natural modes of communication and that it obeys the general law of linguistics with exception of those concerned with phonetics He traces the history of sign language which in his opinion appeared in the year 1535 of the Christian era and perhaps at a more remote epoch The author then refers to the opinions and data which the first chroniclers and historians of Spain secured with respect to this language These Spanish chroniclers and historians make it clear that this language existed in Mexico and was replaced by the spoken lan guage of the Aztecs The author compares theN S VOL XLIII No 1119 signs used by the Indians with those employed by deaf mutes and indicates the origins of the Indian sign language citing cases related to this class of language which were referred to by Homer in the Odyssey In speaking of the signs of the Indians the author treats of pantomime as a means employed in the communication between races of distinct ethnic origin from times of the most re mote antiquity He then refers to the particular sign language of the North American Indians and to the origin and propagation of the signs as well as to the grammatical rules to which the sign lan guage was subject Omaha and Osage Traditions of Separation FRANCIS LA FrLESCHE Before the advent of Europeans the Indians had no means other than by oral accounts to trans mit their rituals and stories of important events Narratives in their transmission often lost im portant details of time or place Accounts of changes that occurred in a tribe became reduced to a few words as in the story of the separation of the Omaha from the Osage The Omaha story of the separation came down in two versions One tells of the attempt to cross the Mississippi in skin boats of being separated by the rising of a heavy mist the other of their efforts to cross the river by means of grapevines spliced together On the visits of the Omaha to the Osage and the Quapaw members of these tribes say to their vis itors I You were a part of us but you went away in an angry mood and never came back because in the distribution of sinew you were slighted An Osage who recently visited the Omaha gave the detailed story here recounted of the separa tion as told by one who was a recognized authority on the traditions of the Osage In this story it was shown that at a tribal ceremony two leaders were reproved for violating the hunting usages Taking offense at this reproof the two leaders broke away from the tribe with many of the fam ilies of the various gentes and these afterward organized and became known as the Omaha tribe Zuii

HEWITT In the esoteric thinking of the early prophetic statesmen of the Iroquois and their cotribesmen the League of the Five Tribes as an institution an organic unity was conceived as a bisexed being or rather person i e an organic whole or totality formed by the union of two human per sons of opposite sex This conception appears in the organic parts of the institution and in the ritual governing the installation of its officers and of those of its constituent organic parts Owing to the vastly differing viewpoint of the civilized man of today from that of the founders of the league this esoteric meaning with its implications is perhaps strange and he may apprehend it only as metaphor because to him it is only poetic To those early prophetic statesmen life was omnipresent obtrusively so For unconsciously it had been imputed by their ancestors to all bod ies and objects and processes of the complex world of human experience The life so imputed was humanlike life And so as an organic totality the league of the Iroquois was conceived as an animate person or being endowed with definite biotic properties or functions among these char acters may be mentioned male and female sex fatherhood and motherhood mind eyesight dream power human blood it was also conceived as hav ing a guardian spirit even as its essential organic parts had These were distinct from those pos sessed or supposed to be possessed by the per sons who composed the people of the league In the ritual of installation of chiefs each of the constituent persons the father and the mother principles represented in the league is addressed as a single individual in all of the many ad dresses and chants and songs In the socalled Six Songs which are so dramatically sung by one rep senting the dead chief to be resurrected each of these constituent persons is addressed but in the fifth song the Totality the League as a Unity is addressed as a person for in its honor is this fifth song being sung Tribes of the Pacific Coast A L KROEBER This paper analyzes a commonly accepted cukl 828 SCIENCEJUNE 9 1916 SCIENCE tural differentiation between the Indians of the narrow belt of the Pacific coast from southern Alaska to southern California and those of the remainder of the continent The difference is found not to extend to specific elements of native civilization but to consist in the use to which such specific elements are put by the two groups of peoples or the setting in which the elements are placed The difference is traceable in material aspects of culture such as agriculture and the art of potterymaking and in nonmaterial as polit ical organization the employment of property and ritualistic expression in religion While the culture of the Pacific coast tribes thus forms a wellmarked unit distinct from the com paratively uniform culture of the remainder of America it does not reveal any indications of definite connection with Asiatic civilizations either in type or in source Its origins must be sought in America When the extreme and puzzling lin guistic diversity of the Pacific coast is examined in the light of recent comparative philological studies this diversity appears to be not funda mental but the result of a differentiating inclina tion connected with the peculiar type of political organization on the Pacific coast The linguistic relationships also indicate that the Pacific coast has long been a fairly defined historical area whose development and population have proceeded at least for several thousand years from within rather than by importation and immigration The Relationship Terms of the Crow and Hidatsa Indians ROBERT I LOWIE The various principles determining the develop ment of kinship terminologies have become clear through the writings of Morgan Rivers and others The time has now come for testing their relative efficacy in concrete instances and within restricted areas More particularly is it desirable to compare the nomenclatures of very closely re lated tribes and to correlate empirically observed changes with probable causes The Crow and Hidatsa systems furnish an instructive case in point While on the one hand they bear clear evi dence of the operation of sociological factors in fundamental features common to both the minor variations are not reducible to such causes and must be referred to the psychologicolinguistic agencies of Kroeber The Sacred Literature of the Cherokee JAMES MOONEY The Cherokee Indians were the aboriginal moun 829 taineers of the southern Alleghanies holding un disputed possession of a territory of some 40000 square miles with a population of about 25000 being numerically historically and culturally the most important single tribe within the United States In 1838 the bulk of the tribe removed to what is now Oklahoma but some 1800 still re main in their native mountains keeping up fairly well their purity of blood and their ancient lan guages and customs Their native culture reached its highest point with the invention of the Chero kee syllabic alphabet by a mixedblood of the tribe about the year 1820 The system was at once adopted by them for purposes of book and newspaper publication current record and corre spondence and even as a medium of instruction in their schools At the same time their priests and doctors seized the opportunity to preserve in permanent form for their own secret use the ritualistic formulas and occult knowledge which had hitherto been transmitted orally and confined to the keeping of initiates of exceptional power of memory In a study of the tribe extending at intervals over a period of thirty years Mr Mooney has been so fortunate as to obtain the original Oherokee manuscripts embodying virtually the whole of this ancient ritual as recorded by noted priests dead many years ago They cover the whole range of Indian interestwar love hunting fishing agri culture gaming and medicineand are without parallel as a revelation of the Indian spiritual idea The expression of the formulas is archaic and symbolic and frequently of high degree of poetic beauty Mr Mooney has them now in prep aration for publication by the Bureau of Ameri can Ethnology Sauk and Fox Notes TRUMAN MICHELSON The writers phonetic scheme of the Fox dialect differs in certain respects from that of the late Dr William Jones These differences consist mainly in the position of the accent the quantity of vowels the quality of o and u vowels and as pirations Some of these differences can be ex plained if we assume that Dr Jones was influenced by the iSauk dialect It is clear that the verbal complex will have to be viewed from a different psychological point of view than has obtained hitherto A few obscure grammatical points have been elucidated The regulations concerning membership in the tribal dual division of the Sauk are not clear whereas those governing membership in the tribalN S VOL XLIII No 1119 dual division of the Foxes have been definitely as certained That the dual division among the Foxes is ceremonial and not merely for athletic purposes has been amply confirmed The ritualistic myths on the origin of sacred packs especially those belonging to entire gentes are all of one and the same type They were doubtless invented in the remote past to account for existing ceremonies Le Verbe dans les Adjectifs et les Adverbes Por teurs A G MORIOE In the Carrier Porteur dialect of the Dene language there is scarcely any regular adjective in our sense of the word Practically all the quali ficative adjectives are regular verbs which may be divided into primary and secondary The former have several forms that change not only according to the nature of the nouns they qualify but also when they imply some comparison Be sides those two categories the Carrier language contains also a third class of verbal adjectives which may be called composite adjectives and are distinguishable by their being made up of an im personal verb and a pronominal prefix A few ad verbs are likewise occasionally conjugated Terms of Relationship and the Levirate E SAIRn Evidence has recently been adduced from Mela nesia and other parts of the world to show that specific features of relationship systems are fre quently explainable as due to definite types of marriage Evidence here presented from aborig inal America shows that in some systems certain relationship terms imply the custom of the levi rate that is the marrying of the deceased wifes sister and its correlate the marrying of the de ceased husbands brother The North Building of the Great Ball Court Chichen Itza Yucatan ADELA BRETON The detached building called Chamber C in Dr A P Maudslays survey at the northern end of the great Ball Court had a single long narrow chamber the inner walls covered with sculptured human figures in relief These are of great inter est and appear much older than those of Chamber E below Temple A the Temple of the Tigers Although part of the vaulted roof remains and though hardest limestone was used it is so weath ered that prolonged study is needed to see the de tails The stones are not large and appear to have been removed from some other building and reerected Instead of the regular rows of armed warriors that cover all three walls in Chamber E there are here two principal groups and a number of detached figures conversing in twos and threes whose relation to the whole is difficult to under stand At the base of the walls is a flowery border separated by a blue band from the figures and the colors were still visible in this border in 1902 The recumbent personage of the paintings in Temple A occupies the center Above there is first a sort of altar with an animal laid on it and five chiefs standing on either side The next set higher has a seated chief with the feathered rattlesnake Facing him stands a being in a gar ment of scales and surrounded by flames or tongues Five chiefs on either side seated on round stools and carrying atlatls complete this group The sculptures on the two round columns which divide the entrance are particularly fine Excavation in the center of the chamber floor exposed a massive round stone cist with heavy cover finely wrought Pocomchi Notes ADELA BRETON The Berendt manuscript collection in the library of the University Museum of Philadelphia con tains three Doctrinas in Pocomchi a volume of sermons at Tactic 181820 with Spanish trans lations a confesionario of 1814 and a fragmen tary original vocabulary The  Doctrinas  can be studied only by making a parallel copy of the three so that the varieties of misspelling may be compared One is dated 1741 by H Aguilera Cura of Tactic but is a poor copy Another is a copy from a manuscript at Tactic of 1810 The third is evidently taken from that and is in Villa cortas Doctrina en lengua Castellana Quekehi y Pocomehi made at Coban 1875 The ignorance of the copyists is well shown in these Thomas Gage the Dominican who was in Guate mala for several years about 1680 was advised to study Pocomehi as it was most spoken about there and in Vera Paz Salvador He calls it Pocomchi or Pocoman and most elegant In three months he learned enough to be able to preach The rudi ments given in his work served Dr Stoll in his study of the modern language but this differs much from the vocabulary Gage was intimate

of the Land as a Factor in Mexican History LEON DOMINIAN The relief of the land has afforded certain lines of easiest access to the plateau region The line of advance of the Mexicans in the course of their early migrations the routes followed by the white man in modern times and railway penetration have all been determined by preexisting natural routes iSettlement has taken place mainly on the plateau and above the 4000foot contour This region constitutes the only favorable human habi tat within present Mexican territory hence is ex plained the excess of population and of the exist ence of the larger cities on the plateau Physical conditions within this tableland have affected the social status of the inhabitants at all times The want of political union found by Cortes and mani fest throughout known Mexican history is largely the result of the conspicuous lack of means of communication Navigable rivers are not found in Mexico while the mountainous and intermon tane regions are characterized by a succession of narrow valleys each practically walled up from the others by intervening ridges over which travel is arduous In the same way the Mexican form of land tenure can be traced to the occurrence of large arid areas The inhabitants of the three tierras reflect respectively the conditions which surround them Prom the standpoint of conti nental relations Mexico is a transition zone both physical and human In the former case the sa lient features of North American physiography are prolonged into Mexico to end in the vicinity of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec In the latter the country can be considered as the link connecting AngloSaxon and Latin America Incense Burners from a Cave near Orizaba H NEWELL WARDLE The Lamborn Collection of the Academy of Nat ural Sciences of Philadelphia contains four curi ous earthenware beasts found in a cave near Ori 831 zaba Mexico Two of the monsters have sup ported incensepans and two were probably at tached to and form a part of such cultus objects of a cave temple The types are believed to be previously undescribed but show affinities both in form and in style of art to the cultus objects from the ancient religious center of Chavcla Guatemala Their relationship to the distribution and signifi cance of the cave god is briefly considered The Rain Ceremony as Practised today by the Maya Indians of Southern Yucatan and North ern British Honduras THOMAS GANN The paper describes the ceremony as practised by the Santa Cruz Icaiche and Xcanha Indians and the mixed Indians inhabiting the northern portion of British Honduras and indicates pointas of resemblance between the ceremony and various ceremonial religious procedures of the Maya of Yucatan at the time of the conquest as well as of the modern Lacandon Indians Climatic Changes and Maya Civilization ELLS WORTH HUNTINGTON In the search for the causes of the rise and fall of civilization the Maya hold a peculiarly impor tant place since they afford an independent Amer ican means of testing conclusions reached in the Old World Perhaps the most striking fact about the Maya civilization is that it developed in a re gion where agriculture is today extremely diffi cult or wellnigh impossible where tropical fevers are at their worst where the hot damp climate is in itself highly enervating and where neither the natives nor the people of Spanish descent have been able to make any progress In the better climate of the Yucatan coast and of the Guate malan plateau however the physical conditions are far more favorable and a certain amount of prog ress can now be seen This suggests that when the Maya flourished the climate can scarcely have been so unfavorable as at present In the corresponding parts of Asia that is in IndoChina and the East Indies similar ruins are found in a similar geographical environment Farther north in the desert belt of both America and Asia there is abundant evidence of an irregular shifting backward and forward of the rainy con ditions of the temperate zone into and out of the present arid regions This process would nat urally force the dry belt alternately to invade the Maya region causing dry conditions favorable to the civilization and to retreat from it causing the present unfavorable conditions Recent investiga tions of the chemical history of the salt lakes ofN S VOL XLIII No 1119 California and Nevada have greatly strengthened this pulsatory hypothesis as it is called If the hypothesis is well grounded the course of his tory in all parts of the world must have been pro foundly modified by repeated climatic changes which have been powerful factors in the fall of civilization at certain times and its rapid develop ment at others Thus the correct interpretation of the general course of Maya history and espe cially the establishment of an unimpeachable chronology assumes added importance It will furnish one of the most critical tests of an hypoth esis which if true will demand a widespread re modeling of the established ideas as to the condi tions necessary to the advancement of civilization The Hotun as the Principal Chronological Unit of the Old Maya Empire SYLVANUS GRISWOLD MORLEY Nine years ago attention was attracted by a certain periodicity in the occurrence of the dated monuments at Quirigua eastern Guatemala a con dition previously noted but not at that time defi nitely established The Quirigua monuments were found to follow each other at intervals of 1800 days and although the sequence was then incomplete subsequent stud ies at the ruins in 191014 have resulted in filling all the lacunae and in finding a corresponding monument for every 1800day period during which the city seems to have been occupied Later investigations particularly during the last two years at all the principal Old Empire sites amply established the former prevalence of this same periodicity in the occurrence of the dated monuments and furthermore have resulted in the identification of the glyph for this 1800 day period for which the name hotun is here sug gested as well as that for the 3600day period for which the name lahuntun is suggested In deed the practise seems to have been so universal during the Old Empire that it is possible to for mulate the following general thesis based upon it The stela type of monument seems to have been used primarily to record the passage of time stelae being erected at intervals of every hotun 1800 days or even multiples thereof as la huntuns 3600 days or katuns 7200 days throughout the Old Empire approximately AD 200 to AD 600 The paper offers this thesis to Maya archeolo gists and presents coincidently a partial summary of the evidence on which it is based illustrated with photographs maps and diagrams The Chilam Balam Books and the Possibility of their Translation ALFRED M TOZZER Owing to the large amount of original manu script material made available during the last two years by Professor William E Gates a great op portunity is offered to Maya students for the study and translation of the Ghilam Balam books With photographic copies of the Motul and San Francisco dictionaries and copies of all the known original Chilam Balam books one has for the first time the material at his disposal As Brinton remarked many years ago CThe task of deciphering these manuscripts is by no means a light one The importance of the re sults which may be expected should serve as a powerful incentive to all Maya students The task is not an impossible one There are cer tainly some passages which will never be trans lated The books as they now appear are copies made chiefly in the eighteenth century or earlier works going back in some cases probably to the sixteenth century The text as a consequence has suffered badly The copyist shows in many cases an ignorance of Maya and in some instances a surprising ignorance of Spanish In several cases Latin words appear in an almost unrecognizable form The Maya is most arbitrarily separated into several different ways on the same page The punctuation is also never consistent The few passages already translated show the great importance attached to the manuscripts The chronological parts have already served to make possible the coordination of Maya and Christian chronology These portions are of course of primary importance The parts deal ing with prophecies and the good and bad days of a year are other parts worthy of study There is much that is almost entirely Spanish in character with little reflection of the native element The medical parts figure largely in many of the manu scripts In most cases the directions for curing various kinds of illness are entirely Spanish in origin The Christian teaching with the  Doc trinas the astrological information and discus sion of the Zodiac as in the Kaua manuscript have little of interest for students of precolum bian history as compared with those portions deal ing with the ancient chronology and the history of the wanderings of the Maya In addition to the translations a careful colla tion of the material from all the manuscripts is absolutely necessary The reconciliation of the various statements regarding similar events in the 832 SCIENCEJUNE 9 1916 SCIENCE different books will be no less difficult than the simple translation of the Maya text Recent Progress in the Study of Maya Art HER BERT J SPINDEN The historical arrangement of sculptures at Copan has now been reduced to great certainty and there is hardly a monument that after exami nation of the carving can not be dated within twenty years Mr S G Morley has succeeded in deciphering most of the inscriptions and there is entire agreement between the dates and the sty listic sequence At cities that flourished in the Great Period 455600 AD the criterion of se quence is seen mostly in the progressive elabora tion of designs by flamboyant details It is neces sary to treat homogeneous material At Quirigua the faces carved on the tops of the bowlder altars furnish an interesting series At Naranjo the ceremonial bar passes from comparative simplicity to extreme complexity and the change is in ac cordance with the inscribed dates Piedras Negras proved to be the most interesting of the sites visited by Mr Morley and the writer in 1914 The monuments give an especially full ac count of the Middle Period and extend well into the Great Period Four monuments represent ing the same subject with considerable intervals of time show a remarkable increase in design elaboration In spite of provincialism that appears in some sites we are now able to strike the general levels of artistic development in practically all Maya cities of the First Empire 200600 AD Pro gressive changes in the construction and orna mentation of buildings is seen very clearly at Yaxchilan The most interesting problems are those of roofcomb support and the origin of the sanctuary Several Yaxchilan temples have dated lintels which bring the sequence in architecture in touch with sequence in sculpture On the Origin and Distribution of Agriculture in America HERBERT J SPINDEN Without agriculture none of the high civiliza tions of the New World would have been pos sible Agriculture was independently developed in America because the plants under domestica tion are different from those of the Old World It probably had one point of actual origin and that was in the region where maize grew wild This region was pretty clearly the highlands of Mexico and Central America Maize with beans and squashes are found throughout the area of agriculture Secondary centers in which special plants were brought under cultivation are seen in 833 Peru the lower Amazon valley etc In the re gion north of Mexico all cultivated plants except tobacco were introduced and none is indigenous therefore the pueblo and mound cultures are not strictly autocthonous Pottery and weaving are practically dependent on agriculture The earliest pottery of Mexico that of the socalled Archaic cultureseems to have developed soon after the rise of agriculture and to have been carried well into South America with the same cultural stream that carried agri culture A peculiar technique can be traced with out change to the Isthmian region and with pro gressive modifications under which the original features can still be seen it can be traced to southern Colombia and well intoVenezuela Rdsum6 of Recent Excavations in Northern Yuca tan EDWARD H TiHOMPSON A r6sume of the excavations conducted in and about northern Yucatan up to the time of the

on the estate of Santa Rita near Corozal in British Honduras a rectangular building the walls of which were covered with stucco paintings of the preCortesian period Those on the north will present a continuous series of Munan figures associated with conventional symbols of glyphs and some of them holding a rope The whole may be interpreted as a picture of the cosmos with the sky and stars above the earth below and the waters under all The figures and symbols repeat the zodiacal sequence found in the constellations of Tezozomoc Sahagun and Duran the Maya day signs the paintings at Mitla and Acanceh the various pictorial sequences in the codices They seem therefore to represent the asterisms deities and daysigns of the Maya zodiac in a correct and continuous sequence the rope being that

his Son made a reconnaissance in the department of Cortes Honduras An examination was made of the archeological conditions along the Ulua River previously reported on by Gordon An important collectioA of antiquities was brought together il lustrating the complex features of this section of Central America objects of several wellknown and fardistant cultures being found in the re stricted area of the broad valley in which flows both the Ulua and ChameliCon rivers Pottery vessels recalling Tarascan Nahuan Costa Rican and Colombian ware in shape and decoration were found as well as the characteristically Mayan type of polychrome and undecorated vessels Jadeite ornaments of unquestioned Costa Rican origin occur and two welldefined examples of the palmastones of the Totonacan class of sculp tures of Vera Cruz were collected In the mountains toward the department of Santa Barbara several large groups of mounds were visited the unknown groups of Mancha gualla and Chasnigua being of particular inter est for further investigation and excavation Mounds and village sites were found also near the borders of Lake Yojoa It is the intention of the Museum of the Ameri can Indian in New York to make a survey of Mos quitia the region lying along the Caribbean Sea from the vicinity of the mouth of the Ulua River to Bluefields embracing a vast strip of territory partly in Honduras partly in Nicaragua This area is little known geographically and less so archeologically Information was obtained show ing Nicaraguan and Costa Rican resemblances in the antiquities such as animalshaped metates and stools reported in this country and shown by sev eral examples in the collections of the Museum of the American Indian collected many years ago by the late Dr Joseph Jones

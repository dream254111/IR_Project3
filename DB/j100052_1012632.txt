BAR AMONG THE EARLY EXPLORERS OF NORTH AMERICA WHO HAVE LEFT THEIR NAMES CLEARLY FIXED UPON THE MAP OF THE WORLD WAS HENRY HUDSON THIS HAS HAPPENED IN A THREEFOLD WAY FOR BY HIS NAME ARE DESIGNATED A MAJESTIC RIVER A WIDE STRAIT AND A GREAT SEA AN ENGLISHMAN HE NAVIGATED NOT ONLY UNDER THE FLAG OF HIS OWN COUNTRY BUT LIKEWISE AT TIMES HE SERVED THE STATES GENERAL OF THE NETHERLANDS IN 1607 IN COMMAND OF THE DUTCH SHIP THE HALF MOON HUDSON ENTERED THE HUDSON RIVER THREE YEARS LATER WITH THE ENGLISH VESSEL THE DISCOVERY HE PASSED THROUGH AND EXPLORED HUDSONS STRAIT IN JUNE 1610 HE ENTERED AND DISCOVERED THE GREAT SEA THAT EVER SINCE HAS BEEN KNOWN AS HUDSONS BAY WHICH WAS TO BE ALIKE HIS TOMB AND HIS CHIEF MONUMENT UNTIL COMPARATIVELY RECENTLY HUDSONS BAY HAS BEEN ACCEPTED BY THE INTERNATIONAL JURISCONSULTS OF THE WORLD AT LARGE AS FORMING ACCORDING TO THE TESTS OF THE RULES OF THE LAW OF NATIONS A PART OF THE HIGH SEAS WITHIN THE LAST FEW YEARS HOWEVER A DESIRE HAS BEGUN TO GROW UP IN CANADA TO ANNEX TO THE TERRITORIAL WATERS OF THE DOMINION IN TOTO THAT GREAT SEA WHICH BEARS HUDSONS NAME FOR EXAMPLE IN THE LAST EDITION OF THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA 1910 IT IS STATED THAT CANADA IS ANXIOUS TO DECLARE HUDSONS BAY A MARE CLAUSUM ON ACCOUNT OF THE WHALE FISHERY LET US CONSIDER VERY BRIEFLY THE LEGAL STATUS OF THE WATERS OF THE HUDSONIAN SEA1 HUDSON ENTERED THAT SEA AT A TIME WHEN THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE PRINCIPLE OF MARE LIBERUM AND MARE CLAUSUM WAS BECOMING AN ACTIVE FACTOR IN THE POLITICAL RELATIONS BETWEEN THE ENGLISH AND THE DUTCH IN EARLIER TIMES UNDER THE TUDORS AND OTHER MORE ANCIENT SOVEREIGNS ENGLAND HAD PURSUED A LIBERAL POLICY AS REGARDS COM MERCE UPON AND FISHERY IN THE SEA INDEED THE GREATEST OF THE TUDORS FOR A MORE EXTENDED AND DETAILED

PERSONAL ACTION IN THE COURTS OF ENGLAND IF HE HAD INJURED ANY ONE THE QUEEN CONTINUED THAT THE SPANIARDS HAD NO RIGHT TO JUSTIFY THEM IN EXCLUD ING THE ENGLISH FROM TRADING WITH THE WEST INDIES THEN

MAGELLAN OVER WHICH THE EMPIRE CANNOT EXTEND AND STILL LESS A RIGHT OF PROPERTY A BAY WHOSE ENTRANCE MAY BE DEFENDED MAY BE POSSESSED AND RENDERED SUBJECT TO THE LAWS OF THE SOVEREIGN AND IT IS OF IMPORTANCE THAT IT SHOULD BE SO SINCE THE COUNTRY MAY BE MUCH MORE EASILY INSULTED IN SUCH A PLACE THAN ON THE COAST OPEN TO THE WINDS AND THE IMPETUOSITY OF THE WAVES THUS VATTEL INSISTS THAT IN ORDER THAT A BAY MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A MARE CLAUSUM ITS ENTRANCE FROM THE SEA MUST BE SO NARROW THAT IT CAN BE DOMINATED AND CONTROLLED FROM THE OPPOSING SHORES HUDSONS STRAIT WHICH CONNECTS HUDSONS BAY WITH BAFFINS BAY AND THE ATLANTIC OCEAN IS AT ALL POINTS FORTYFIVE MILES WIDE AND IN GENERAL IT EXTENDS TO A WIDTH FAR GREATER GENERALLY OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILES5 ACCORDING TO THE ABOVE

OPINION THAT HUDSONS BAY WAS AN OPEN SEA THE EXTENT OF THE TERRITORIAL SEA WAS GRADUALLY FIXED AT THE DISTANCE OF A CANNON SHOT FROM THE LAND WHICH WAS TRANSLATED BY DEGREES INTO ONE MARINE LEAGUE OR

THE ZONE OF TERRI TORIAL WATERS TO BAYS AND GULFS AND OTHER SINUOSITIES THERE GRADUALLY AROSE AS A COROLLARY THE RULE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW THAT WHERE THE THREEMILE ZONES ADVANCING FROM EACH SHORE AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE BAY OR OTHER KIND OF SINUOSITY MEET AND FORM A LINE SIX MILES ACROSS FROM LAND TO LAND THAT LINE OF SIX MILES SHOULD BE TAKEN AS THE BASE FROM WHICH TO MEASURE THE THREEMILE ZONE SEAWARD AND THAT THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE STATE MASTER OF THE SURROUNDING LAND DID NOT EXTEND FURTHER OUTWARD TOWARDS THE SEA BUT THAT ALL THE EXPANSE OF THE BAY INSIDE OF THAT SIXMILE LINE NO MATTER HOW WIDE AND LARGE THE BAY FURTHER WITHIN MIGHT BECOME SHOULD BELONG TO THE ENCIRCLING NATION BECAUSE THE ENTRANCE WAS EFFECTUALLY OCCUPIED WHERE THE SHORES WERE NOT MORE THAN SIX MILES APART BUT THE

A BAY SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO CLOUD THE QUESTION IN ISSUE FOR THOUGH IT IS CAILED A BAY IT IS IN REALITY A LARGE SEA NOT ONLY IS HUDSONS BAY SEVERAL TIMES AS LARGE AS THE AREA OF GREAT BRITAIN BUT IN ADDITION IT IS MUCH LARGER THAN SUCH SEAS AS THE BALTIC AND THE ADRIATIC BOTH OF WHICH WERE IN FORMER CENTURIES CLOSED BUT ARE NOW OPEN SEAS IN FACT IT IS LARGER THAN THE NORTH SEA AND THE SEA OF JAPAN AND COMPARES FAVORABLY IN ITS AREA WITH BERING SEA ALL OF WHICH FORM PART OF THE HIGH SEAS ESPECIALLY HOWEVER A COMPARISON OF THE SIZE AND LEGAL STATUS OF HUDSONS BAY AND THE GULF OF ST LAWRENCE

WAS ARRANGED BY THE TREATY OF 517 OF APRIL 1824 WHICH RECOGNIZED AMONG OTHER THINGS THE FREEDOM OF THE NORTH PACIFIC OCEAN THE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN GREAT BRITAIN AND RUSSIA WERE MORE PROTRACTED BUT WERE FINALLY ARRANGED BY TREATY IN 1825 GEORGE CANNING FOREIGN SECRETARY OF GREAT BRITAIN WROTE ON SEPTEMBER 27 1822 TO THE BRITISH PREMIER THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON WITH RESPECT TO THE CLAIMS ADVANCED BY THE MOSCOVITE GOVERNMENT OVER THE WATERS OF BERING SEA AND THE EXTREME NORTHERN PART OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN CONCERNING THE PRETENSIONS ADVANCED BY RUSSIA IN THE UKASE OF 1821 CANNING MAINTAINED THAT SUCH CLAIMS WERE ACCORDING TO THE BEST LEGAL AUTHORITIES POSITIVE INNOVATIONS ON THE RIGHTS OF NAVIGATION BY COMMON USAGE AN ACCESSORIAL BOUND ARY HE SAID HAD BEEN ADDED FOR A LIMITED DISTANCE TO THE SHORES OF A STATE IN ORDER TO SECURE TO THAT NATION SUFFICIENT PROTECTION WITHOUT INTERFERING WITH THE RIGHTS OF THE SUBJECTS OF OTHER STATES TO NAVIGATE AND TRADE FREELY AS STATED IN THE UKASE THE RUSSIAN CLAIMS HE MAINTAINED DISREGARDED THIS IMPORTANT QUALIFICATION AND CONSEQUENTLY WERE AN ENCROACHMENT ON THE FREEDOM OF NAVIGA TION AND THE INALIENABLE RIGHTS OF NATIONS CONTINUING CANNING REFERRED TO AN EXCHANGE OF VIEWS THAT HE HAD HAD WITH THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR AND SAID THAT HE THOUGHT THAT RUSSIA WOULD RESCIND THAT PORTION OF HER PUBLIC NOTIFICATION WHEREBY SHE HAD ANNOUNCED THAT SHE WOULD CONSIDER THE PORTIONS OF THE OCEAN INCLUDED BETWEEN THE ADJOINING COASTS OF AMERICA AND THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE AS A MARE CLAUSUM AND TO EXTEND THE EXCLUSIVE TERRITORIAL JURISDICTION OF RUSSIA TO 100 ITALIAN MILES THUS CANNING IN A COMMUNICATION TO HIS CHIEF THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON THE EXECUTIVE HEAD AT THAT TIME OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE MAINTAINED THAT THE CLAIM OF RUSSIA TO EXERCISE TO THE EXCLUSION OF OTHERS HER SOVEREIGNTY OVER A LARGE PORTION OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN AND ALSO OVER BERING SEA WHICH WAS BOUNDED EXCLUSIVELY BY HER COASTS THOUGH WITH MANY PASSAGES MORE THAN SIX MILES WIDE CONNECTING THE MAIN OCEAN WITH BERING SEA WAS NOT JUSTIFIED BY THE LAW OF NATIONS EITHER AS TAUGHT BY THE JURISTS LEARNED IN THAT SCIENCE OR BY THE ACTUAL PRACTICE OF NATIONS 53THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY THE PRINCIPAL OBJECT OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH RUSSIA FROM 1821 TO 1825 THAT RESULTED IN THE TREATY OF 1825 WAS TO MAINTAIN THE FREEDOM OF THE WATERS OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN AND BERING SEA THIS WE KNOW FROM THE INSTRUCTIONS THAT GEORGE CANNING BRITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY GAVE TO HIS COUSIN SIR STRATFORD CANNING AS THE LATTER WAS ABOUT STARTING TO RESUME NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT AT THE POINT WHERE THEY HAD BEEN SUSPENDED AT AN EARLIER DATE IN THE LATTER PART OF THE INSTRUCTIONS TO SIR STRATFORD THE BRITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY SAID 7 IT REMAINS ONLY IN RECAPITULATION TO REMIND YOU OF THE ORIGIN AND PRINCIPLES OF THIS WHOLE NEGOTIATION IT IS NOT ON OUR PART ESSENTIALLY A NEGOTIATION ABOUT LIMITS IT IS THE DEMAND OF THE REPEAL OF AN OFFENSIVE AND UNJUSTIFIABLE ARROGATION OF EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OVER AN OCEAN OF UNMEASURED EXTENT BUT A DEMAND QUALIFIED AND MITIGATED IN ITS MANNER IN ORDER THAT ITS JUSTICE MAY BE ACKNOWL EDGED AND SATISFIED WITHOUT SORENESS OR HUMILIATION ON THE PART OF RUSSIA WE NEGOTIATE ABOUT TERRITORY TO COVER UP THE REMONSTRANCE UPON PRINCIPLE BUT ANY ATTEMPT TO TAKE UNDUE ADVANTAGE OF THIS VOLUNTARY FACILITY WE MUST OPPOSE THUS THE BRITISH EMPIRE SOUGHT FOR HER CHIEF OBJECT DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS OVER HER CONFLICTING INTERESTS WITH THOSE OF THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE CONCERNING LAND AND SEA IN NORTHWESTERN AMERICA AND BERING SEA TO OBTAIN FROM THE MOSCOVITE GOVERNMENT A PUBLIC DISCLAIMER OF IHE CLAIM ADVANCED BY RUSSIA IN 1821 THAT BERING SEA AND LARGE PARTS OF THE NORTHERN PACIFIC OCEAN WERE RUSSIAN TERRITORIAL WATERS IN THE ANGLORUSSIAN TREATY OF FEBRUARY 1628 1825 CONCLUDED BY SIR STRATFORD CANNING FOR GREAT BRITAIN AND COUNT NESSELRODE AND M DE POLETICA FOR RUSSIA THE LATTER NATION GAVE UP HER PRETEN SIONS TO ABSOLUTE JURISDICTION OVER THE WATERS OF THE NORTH PACIFIC OCEAN OR BERING SEA BEYOND THE USUAL LIMIT ALONG THE COASTS18 AT THE SAME TIME THE TWO NATIONS AGREED UPON

SEA AS WELL AS PART OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN FURTHER TOWARD THE SOUTH RUSSIA WISHED VERY MUCH TO INCLUDE BERING SEA WITHIN HER OWN DOMAIN AS A MARE CLAUSUM LIKE THE UNITED STATES HOWEVER GREAT BRITAIN CONTESTED THIS PROPOSED EXTENSION OF RUSSIAN JURISDICTION OVER ALL OF BERING SEA ON THE PLEA THAT ACCORDING TO THE ACCEPTED RULES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW BERING SEA FORMED A PART OF THE HIGH SEAS AND CONSEQUENTLY WAS AN OPEN SEA AND AS THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT GAVE UP IN 1824 TO THE UNITED STATES IT LIKEWISE YIELDED IN 1825 BEFORE THE PROTEST OF GREAT BRITAIN THE MOSCOVITE CLAIM THAT BERING SEA WAS A MARE CLAUSUM BUT IF BERING SEA WAS A MARE LIBERUM AS THE GOVERNMENT OF GREAT BRITAIN ASSERTED WITH SO GREAT SUCCESS IN 1825 AGAINST THE CONTRARY CLAIM OF THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT WHY THEN ACCORDING TO THE SAME LINE OF ARGUMENT IS NOT HUDSONS BAY ALSO A MARE LIBERUM SURELY THE STRONG PRESENTATION OF FACTS AND THE ABLE ARGUMENTS MADE WITH SUCH SUCCESS BY THE OFFICIAL REPRESENTATIVES OF GREAT BRITAIN IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE LAST CENTURY AGAINST THE ATTEMPT OF RUSSIA TO WITHDRAW BERING SEA FROM THE AREA OF THE HIGH SEAS BY DECLARING IT A CLOSED SEA ARE APPLICABLE TO THE ANALOGOUS STATUS OF THE WATERS OF HUDSONS BAY SURELY IF BERING SEA WAS AN OPEN SEA IN 1825 SO ALSO WAS HUDSONS BAY WHEN SINCE THAT TIME HAVE EITHER OR BOTH OF THEM BECOME CLOSED SEAS FROM THE FOREGOING BRIEF SURVEY OF SOME OF THE HISTORIC FACTS AND RULES AFFECTING THE INTERNATIONAL STATUS OF THE WATERS OF THE HUD SONIAN SEA IT IS EVIDENT THAT THAT GREAT BODY OF SALT WATER FORMS LIKE BERING SEA THE BALTIC SEA THE

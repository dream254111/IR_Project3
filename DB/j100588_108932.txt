THALMIC MEDICINE AND SURGERY IN UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON OPHTHALMIC SURGEON TO THE UNIVERSITY COLLEYEHOSPITAL C RECEIVED NOVEMBER 26 1867READ JANUARY 8 1868 INTRODUCTION THE REMARKABLE PULSATING ORGAN IN THE TAIL OF THE EEL WHICH FORMS THE SUBJECT OF THIS PAPER WAS DISCOVERED BY THE LATE DR MARSHALL HALL HE VIEWED IT AS BELONGING TO THE BLOODVASCULAR SYSTEM AND NAMED IT THE C CAUDAL HEART HIS DESCRIPTION OF IT WAS FOUNDED ON OBSERVATIONS MADE ON SMALL EELS UNDER THE MICRO SCOPE IN LARGE EELS THE HEART MAY AS HE ALSO POINTED OUT BE SEEN WITH THE NAKED EYE BY SPREADING THE TAIL ON A PLATE OF GLASS AND VIEWING IT AGAINST THE LIGHT NOT ONLY HOWEVER ARE THE PULSATIONS OF THE ORGAN ITSELF THUS VISIBLE BUT ALSO THE VERY PECULIAR APPEARANCE OF SUCCESSIVE DROPS OF BLOOD PROPELLED AS IF FROM THE HEART WITH GREAT VELO CITY ALONG THE CAUDAL VEIN WHICH WAS OBSERVED BY DR MARSHALL HALL IN HIS MICROSCO PICAL EXAMINATIONS THOUGH INCORRECTLY INTERPRETED BY HIM TO EXPLAIN THE TRUE NATURE OF THE PHENOMENON HERE REFERRED TOTO PROVE THEREBY THAT THE CAUDAL HEART BELONGS NOT TO THE BLOODVASCULAR SYSTEM BUT TO THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM AND TO INQUIRE INTO THE INFLUENCE WHICH THE FORCE OF THE LYMPHSTREAM FROM THE HEART EXERTS IN ACCELERATING AND PROMOTING THE FLOW OF BLOOD IN THE CAUDAL VEIN CONSTITUTE THE OBJECT OF THE COMMUNICATION HERE PRESENTED TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY MY OBSERVATIONS LIKE THOSE OF DR MARSHALL HALL WERE MADE ON SMALL EELS UNDER THE MICROSCOPE A THIRD OF AN INCH OBJECTIVE BY THE MESSRS MERZ OF MUNICH WITH THE LOWEST EYE PIECE WAS THE MICROSCOPICAL POWER EMPLOYED THE SMALL EEL USED FOR THE PURPOSE ONE OF THE SIZE OF THOSE COMMONLY KEPT IN AQUARIA WAS SECURED BY WRAPPING IT UP IN A BIT OF WET RAG LEAVING ONLY ABOUT ONE INCH OF THE TAIL HANGING OUT THE GLASS SLIDE ON WHICH THE ANIMAL WAS PLACED WAS ABOUT DOUBLE THE USUAL LENGTH MDCCCLXVIII 4 Z676 PROFESSOR T WHARTON JONES ON THE CAUDAL HEART OF THE EEL BEING LAID ON THE SLIDE WITH THE TAIL IN PROPER POSITION THE ANIMNAL WAS FIXED BY TYING A STRING LOOSELY ROUND THE SLIDE AND ITS BODY WHERE ENVELOPED IN THE RAG THE PART OF THE TAIL TO BE EXAMINED WAS COVERED WITH WATER AND A THIN PLATE OF GLASS MATTERS BEING THUS ARRANGED AND THE MICROSCOPE ADJUSTED RAPID PULSATIONS ARE IMME DIATELY DETECTED ON DIRECTING THE EYE TO THE REGION OF THE EXTREME END OF THE VERTEBRAL COLUMNABDOMINAL SIDED NO VERY WELLDEFINED HEARTLIKE ORGAN IS OBSERVABLE AT FIRST SIGHT BUT THE PULSATIONS SEEM AS IF IN THE TISSUE OF THE PART GENERALLY THE SKIN AND SUBSTANCE OF THE TAIL SUR ROUNDING THE HEART ARE DRAWN SOMEWHAT TOGETHER AT EACH SYSTOLE AND FALL BACK INTO THEIR PREVIOUS STATE AT EACH DIASTOLE FROM THIS IT MAY BE INFERRED THAT THE HEART DOES NOT LIE FREE IN A SPECIAL CAVITY NOR EVEN IN LOOSE CELLULAR TISSUE BUT THAT IT IS IMBEDDED IN THE SUBSTANCE OF THE TAIL DISSECTION OF THE TAIL OF A LARGE EEL SHOWS THAT THE HEART IS CONNECTED WITH THE ADJACENT BONEST THE GREAT VEIN OF THE TAIL IS FORMED BY THE JUNCTION OF TWO TRUNKS A LARGER AND A SMALLER  THE LARGER TRUNK RECEIVES THE VENOUS RADICLES RETURNING THE BLOOD FROM THE TERMINAL AND ABDOMINAL PARTS OF THE CAUDAL FIN THE SMALLER TRUNK RECEIVES THE VENOUS RADICLES RETURNING THE BLOOD FROM THE DORSAL PART IT IS INTO THIS SMALLER TRUNK NEAR ITS JUNCTION WITH THE LARGER THAT THE CAUDAL HEART OPENS THE GREAT ARTERY OF THE TAIL 1 RUNS CLOSE ALONGSIDE THE VEIN AND IS SMALLER THAN IT AND SOMEWHAT TORTUOUS IT GIVES OFF BRANCHES TO THE ABDOMINAL AND DORSAL PARTS OF THE CAUDAL FIN WHILST THE CONTINUATION OF IT SUBDIVIDES INTO THE SMALL RAMIFICATIONS DISTRIBUTED TO THE TERMINAL PART THIS CONTINUATION OF THE ARTERY AND THE LARGER TRUNK OF THE GREAT CAUDAL VEIN DIVERGE FROM EACH OTHER IN THEIR COURSE TOWARDS THE END OF THE TAIL AND THEN AFTER HAVING BECOME SMALL BY THE GIVING OFF OF BRANCHES APPROACH CURVINGLY AND CROSS EACH OTHER AT THE PLACE WHERE THE SPINE ENDS AND THE TERMINAL PART OF THE CAUDAL FIN COMMENCES THE ELONGATED SPACE BOUNDED BY THE ARTERY AND VEIN THUS DIVERGING FROM AND AGAIN APPROACHING EACH OTHER IS THAT IN WHICH THE LYMPHATIC HEART IS SITUATED DESCRIPTION AND EXPLANATION OF THE PHENOMENA ATTENDING THE PROPULSION OF THE LYMPHFROM THE CAUDAL HEART INTO THE CAUDAL VEIN AT THE OPENING OF THE CAUDAL HEART INTO THE VEIN THERE IS A VALVE WHICH PREVENTS REGURGITATION OF THE LYMPH BACK FROM THE VEIN INTO THE HEART BUT OWING

THE THIN WEB OF THE BATS WING AND THEIR WORKINGS CANNOT BE OBTAINED WHEN BY THE CONTRACTION OF THE HEART THE LYMPH IS PROPELLED INTO THE VEIN THE FLOW OF BLOOD FROM THAT VESSEL INTO THE GREAT CAUDAL TRUNK IS INTERRUPTED BY THE FORCE OF THE LYMPHSTREAM FROM THE PLACE WHERE THE HEART OPENS INTO THE VEIN TO THE JUNCTION OF THE LATTER WITH THE CAUDAL TRUNK COLOURLESS LYMPH THUS REPLACES RED BLOOD WHILST IN THE CAUDAL TRUNK ITSELF THE LYMPH STILL UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE HEARTS FORCE SO FAR DISPLACES THE BLOOD AS TO FLOW IN A COLOURLESS STREAM ON ONE SIDE OF THE VESSEL THE SIDE CORRESPONDING TO THAT ON WHICH THE HEART OPENS FOR SOME DISTANCE DISTINCT FROM AND UNMINGLED WITH THE BLOODSTREAM FROM THE LOWER PART OF THE VEIN AND FROM ITS LATERAL BRANCHEST DURING THE DIASTOLE OF THE HEART THE STREAM OF LYMPH INTO THE VEIN INTERMITTING THE FLOW OF BLOOD FROM THAT VESSEL INTO THE GREAT TRUNK OF THE CAUDAL VEIN AGAIN TAKES PLACE NO SOONER HOWEVER HAS A SMALL QUANTITY OF BLOOD ENTERED THAN SYSTOLE OF THE HEART ENSUING THE STREAM OF LYMPH THEREBY PROPELLED INTO THE VEIN DRIVES THE SMALL QUANTITY OF BLOOD BEFORE IT INTO THE GREAT CAUDAL VENOUS TRUNK WHILST IT AT THE SAME TIME ARRESTS AS BEFORE THE FLOW OF BLOOD INTO THE GREAT CAUDAL VEIN FROM ITS TRIBUTARY VESSEL IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE ARRESTMENT OF THE FLOW OF RED BLOOD IN THE VEIN UNDER NOTICE THOUGH FOR SO SHORT A TIME THE RED CORPUSCLES APPEAR TO BECOME UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CONTACT WITH THE LYMPH AGGREGATED TOGETHER AT THE PLACE  SO THAT WHEN BY THE DIASTOLE OF THE HEART THE FLOW OF BLOOD IS AGAIN PERMITTED IT IS A SMALL MASS OF AGGREGATED RED CORPUSCLES WHICH ENTERS THE GREAT CAUDAL VEINI AND IS DURING THE ENSUING SYSTOLE OF THE HEART DRIVEN BEFORE THE STREAM OF LYMPH ISSUING THEREFROM IN THE OBSERVATION NOW DESCRIBED WE HAVE THUS PRESENTED TO OUR EYE THE REMARKABLE PHENOMENON OF SMALL DROPS OF RED BLOOD OR AGGLOMERATIONS OF RED CORPUSCLES PROPELLED IN RAPID SUCCESSION IN THE COLOURLESS STREAM OF LYMPH ABOVE DESCRIBED AS SEEN WITHIN AND TO ONE SIDE OF THE GREAT CAUDAL VENOUS TRUNK 11 SUCH IS THE TRUE NATURE OF THE PHENOMENON WHICH HAS HITHERTO BEEN ERRONEOUSLY SUP POSED TO BE OWING TO THE CAUDAL HEART TRANSMITTING AT EACH SYSTOLE A DROP OF BLOOD INTO THE CAUDAL VEIN THE INTERMITTENT PROPULSION OF DROPS OF RED BLOOD INTO AND ALONG THE CAUDAL VEIN GIVES THE APPEARANCE AT FIRST SIGHT AS IF THE VEIN PULSATED BUT NEITHER THAT VESSEL NOR THE ADJACENT ARTERIAL TRUNK DOES SO THE UNDULATORY APPEARANCE OF THE STREAM IN THE CAUDAL VEIN IS SEEN TO BE CONTINUED TO A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE UPWARDS THE BLOOD AND LYMPHSTREAMS AT LAST MINGLE AND THE RESULT IS A BLOOD PALER AND BRIGHTER EVEN THAN THAT IN THE ADJACENT ARTERY  PLATE XXXV FIG 1 D FIG 2 DF T PLATE XXXV FIG 1  PLATE XXXV FIGS 2 G  IN A

TRIBUTARY VEIN THE BLOODSTREAM DOES NOT YIELD SO READILY AS ABOVE DESCRIBED TO DISPLACEMENT BY THE LYMPHSTREAM FROM THE HEART BUT THE PROPULSION OF THE DROPS OF RED BLOOD PRESENTS A REMITTENT RATHER THAN AN INTERMITTENT CHARACTER INFINENCE OF THE FORCE WITH WHICH THE 4YMPHSTREAM IS PROPELLED FROM THE CAUDAL HEART IN ACCELERATING ANDPROMOTING THE FLOW OF BLOOD IN THE CAUDAL VEIN THE FORCE WITH WHICH THE LYMPH IS PROPELLED BY THE HEART INTO THE CAUDAL VEIN MAY BE JUDGED OF COMPARATIVELY BY CONTRASTING THE FORCE OF THE STREAM AS INDICATED BY RAPIDITY OF FLOW IN THE TRIBUTARIES OF THE VEIN WITH THAT OF THE STREAM IN THE VEIN ITSELF WHILST THE LYMPH IS BEING PROPELLED INTO IT WITHIN THE VEIN THE FORCE OF THE LYMPH STREAM IS EVIDENCED BY THE FACT ABOVE MENTIONED THAT AT THE MOMENT OF THE PROPULSION OF THE LYMPH INTO THE VEIN BY THE CONTRACTION OF THE HEART THE ONWARD COURSE OF THE BLOOD IN THE TRIBUTARY VEIN IS ARRESTED AND THE COLUMN OF BLOOD IN THE CAUDAL TRUNK DISPLACED TO ONE SIDE AND ALSO BY THE MANNER IN WHICH THE DROPS OF RED BLOOD OR AGGLO MERATIONS OF RED CORPUSCLES WHICH ENTER THE CAUDAL TRUNK FROM THE TRIBUTARY VEIN DURING THE DIASTOLE ARE SEEN DRIVEN ON IN THE LYMPHSTREAM AT EACH SYSTOLE OF THE HEART THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF THE STREAM OF LYMPH PROPELLED INTO THE GREAT CAUDAL VEIN AT EACH STROKE OF THE HEART AN IMPETUS IS COMMUNICATED TO THE COLUMN OF BLOOD IN THAT VESSEL WHICH WE CAN OBSERVE HAS THE EFFECT OF ACCELERATING AND PROMOTING ITS ONWARD FLOW TO THE BLOODHEART OF THE ANIMAL WE THUS SEE THAT THOUGH THE CAUDAL HEART OF THE EEL IS A LYMPHATIC HEART ITS FUNCTION BEING TO RECEIVE LYMPH ON THE ONE HAND AND TO PROPEL IT INTO THE GREAT VEIN OF THE TAIL ONE THE OTHER IT AT THE SAME TIME PERFORMS THE SECONDARY FUNCTION OF ACCELERATING AND PROMOTING THE FLOW OF THE BLOOD IN THAT VESSEL IN ITS COURSE BACK TO THE BLOODHEART RELEOLOGICALLY SPEAKING THE GREAT LENGTH OF THE TAIL OF THE EEL SEEMS TO RENDER A REASON FOR SUCH A PROVISION IN RESPECT TO THE SECONDARY FUNCTION OF THE CAUDAL HEART OF THE EEL HERE MENTIONED AN ANALOGY MAY THUS BE TRACED BETWEEN IT AND THE RHYTHMICALLY CONTRACTILE VEINS OF THE MUCH ELONGATED WING OF THE BAT FOW DOES THE LYMPH ENTER THE CAUDAL HEART THIS QUESTION DOES NOT PROPERLY COME WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE PRESENT PAPER IT MAY HOWEVER BE REMARKED THAT I HAVE OBSERVED UNDER THE MICROSCOPE NO DEFINED LYMPHATIC VESSELS OPENING INTO THE HEART AND ONLY AN INDISTINCT APPEARANCE OF AFFERENT STREAMS OF LYMPH IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY LYMPHATIC CANALS OPENING INTO THE HEART SUCH AS THOSE THE LATE PROFESSOR JOHANNES

ARRANGEMENT OF THE CANALS DESCRIBED BY MFLLER IS IDENTICAL WITH THAT OF THE BLOODVESSELS OF THE CAUDAL FIN AND I CANNOT HELP SUSPECTING THAT IT WAS THOSE VERY VESSELS WHICH THAT DISTINGUISHED PHYSIOLOGIST HAD INJECTED INDEED HE SEEMS TO HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY TACITLY ADMITTED AS MUCH WHEN IN HIS PHYSIOLOGY BALYS TRANSLATION 2ND EDITION VOL I P 245 1839 HE SAYS WITHOUT ANY EXPRESSION OF DISSENT OR COMMENT 4 DR MARSHALL HALL HAS DISCOVERED IN THE EEL A KIND OF AUXILIARY VENOUS HEART SITUATED AT EACH SIDE OF THE LAST CAUDAL VERTEBRA WHICH PUMPS THE BLOOD OUT OF THE SMALL VEINS OF THE EXTREMITY OF THE CAUDAL FIN INTO THE VENA CAUDALIS IT MAY BE PROPER TO REMARK HERE THAT MFLLERS INJECTIONS OF THE ALLEGED LYMPHATIC CANALS APPEAR TO ME FROM HIS DESCRIPTION POGGENDORFFS ANNALEN LOC CIT TO HAVE BEEN MADE NOT FROM THE CAUDAL HEART NOR EVEN FROM THE GREAT CAUDAL VEIN BUT FROM THE TWO TRIBUTARY VENOUS TRUNKS WHICH UNITE TO FORM THAT VESSEL HISTORICAL RETROSPECT REGARDING THE DISCOVERY OF THE CAUDAL HEART OF THE EEL AND THE OPINIONS ENTERTAINED OF ITS NATURE DR MARSHALL HALL MADE KNOWN HIS DISCOVERY OF THE CAUDAL HEART IN THE EEL IN HIS CRITICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ESSAY ON THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD PUBLISHED IN 1831 HE VIEWED IT AS AN AUXILIARY HEART BELONGING TO THE BLOODVASCULAR SYSTEM AS PREVIOUSLY STATED AND ERRONEOUSLY SUPPOSED THAT THE DROPS OF RED BLOOD SEEN PASSING IN RAPID SUC CESSION ALONG THE CAUDAL VEIN WERE PROPELLED FROM IT HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENON IS IN THE FOLLOWING WORDS  BY A SUDDEN CON TRACTION OF THIS THE VENTRICLE OF THE HEART IT I E THE BLOOD WHICH HAD ENTERED IT IN THE MANNER HE ERRONEOUSLY SUPPOSED IS GATHERED INTO A DROP AND PROPELLED WITH GREAT VELOCITY AND AT FIRST WITH THE PECULIAR APPEARANCE OF SUCCESSIVE DROPS ALONG A VESSEL WHICH ASCENDS ALONG THE INFERIOR SPINAL CANAL AND WHICH MUST ALTHOUGH IT PURSUES A DIRECTION TOWARDS THE HEART BE CONSI DERED AN ARTERY  THE ANATOMICAL RELATIONS BETWEEN THE CAUDAL HEART AND BLOOD VESSELS AND BETWEEN THE BLOODVESSELS THEMSELVES AS DESCRIBED AND DELINEATED BY DR MARSHALL HALL ARE ALTOGETHER INCORRECT IN HIS FIGURE OF THE CAUDAL HEART AN OUTLINE COPY OF WHICH IS HERE ANNEXED VESSELS ARE REPRESENTED AS ARISING FROM THE HEART AND RETURNING SOME TO IT AND SOME TO THE CAUDAL VEIN AFTER HAVING FORMED A LOOP AN ANATOMICAL ARRANGEMENT VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE REALITY AS MAY BE SEEN BY COMPARING PLATE XXXV FIG I WHICH ACCOMPANIES THIS PAPER 71  1 I K IT NEED SCARCELY BE REMARKED THAT AN ORGAN WITH SUCH A STRUCTURE AS THAT DESCRIBED BY  OP CIT P 172680 PROFESSOR T WHARTON JONES ON THE CAUDAL HEART OF THE EEL DR MARSHALL HALL WOULD HAVE BEEN INADEQUATE FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FUNCTION LHE ATTRIBUTED TO THE CAUDAL HEART OF THE EEL THOUGH THE LATE PROFESSOR JOHANNES MTLLER IN HIS PAPER IN POGGENDORFFS  ANNALEN FOR 1832 ABOVE QUOTED REMARKS THAT FURTHER OBSERVATIONS MUST TEACH WHETHER THE FUNCTION OF THIS ORGAN THE CAUDAL HEART IN THE EEL THE DISCOVERY OF WHICH BY DR MAR SHALL HALL HE HAD JUST LEARNED FROM THE 698TH NUMBER OF FRORIEPS  NOTIZEN IS TO DRIVE THE LYMPH OF THE TAIL INTO THE END OF THE CAUDAL VEIN HE DID NOT IN HIS PAPER ON THE LYMPHATIC HEARTS OF AMUPHIBIA QUESTION DR MARSHALL HALLS REPRESENTATION OF IT AS A BLOODHEART IN THE PAPER REFERRED TO WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS FOR 1833 AND IS ENTITLED ON THE EXISTENCE OF FOUR DISTINCT HEARTS HAVING REGULAR PULSA TIONS CONNECTED WITH THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM IN CERTAIN AMPHIBIOUS ANIMALS PROFESSOR MPLLER THEN OF BONN MAKES THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT IN THE VASCULAR SYSTEM OF THE BLOOD THERE CERTAINLY ARE PARTICULAR PLACES BESIDES THE HEART WHICH ARE CAPABLE OF CON TRACTIONS AS FOR EXAMPLE THE BULBUS AORTAE IN FISHES AND BATRACHIA THE VEND CAVE WHERE THEY ENTER THE ATRIUM AND THE PULSATING ORGAN DISCOVERED BY DR MARSHALL HALL IN THE EEL AT THE END OF THE VENA CAUDALIS WHERE THAT ORGAN RECEIVES THE BRANCHES OF THE EXTRE MITY OF THE TAIL AND CONDUCTS ITS BLOOD INTO THE VENA

216 AND 245 SHOWS THAT PROFESSOR MFLLER DID NOT IN THESE MORE RECENT WRITINGS DISSENT FROM DR MARSHALL HALL IN THE OPINION HE ENTERTAINED THAT THE C CAUDAL HEART  IN THE EEL BELONGS TO THE BLOODVASCULAR SYSTEM SO FAR AS I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ASCERTAIN NO ONE HAS HITHERTO GIVEN A CORRECT EXPLANATION OF THE PHENOMENON OF SMALL DROPS OF RED BLOOD PROPELLED IN RAPID SUCCESSION AS IF FROM THE CAUDAL HEART ALONG THE CAUDAL VEIN WITHOUT FIRST SHOWING THAT THESE DROPS OF BLOOD OR AGGLOMERATIONS OF RED CORPUSCLES ARE MT PROPELLED FROM THE HEART AND WITHOUT SHOWING THAT IT IS COLOURLESS LYMPH

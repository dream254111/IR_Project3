South America By WILLIAM C WELLS Chief Statistician Pan American Union TO appraise the present status of South American international trade it is necessary that we have a correct understanding of what this trade was before the war what had been its development and what its tendencies were More than all we must understand what was its economic base Fourfifths of the trade was with the countries that took part in the Great War ninetenths if we do not count the noncompetitive and the interstate trade The war produced temporary changes in the currents of South American trade and industry and some of these may prove to be permanent Complete returns for working out the percentages of 1920 can not yet be assembled but partial reports make it certain that no material change in the current of trade has occurred since January 1 1920 Before the war about twothirds of South Americas exports were to Great Britain the United States Germany and France Leaving out the inter state frontier exports which are only in a technical sense international practi cally the whole export trade was to the United States and Western Europe and nearly 90 per cent to the four countries mentioned It could not be

On the other hand South America needed manufactures of all kinds Outside of a few food deficiencies in certain countries supplied in the main by neighboring countries the only im ports of South America were of manu factures so that the countries to which their raw products went were the same and the only countries from which the imports came or could come The war produced certain changes in the distribution of exports and imports but it did not and could not alter the essential fact that the United States and Western Europe were the only sources from which South America drew its needed supplies and the only markets wherein to sell its produce Here and elsewhere in this article Canada is viewed as an economic ex tension of the United States or of Great Britain if one so chooses

States and in England France Bel gium and other countries of Western Europe all the countries of Latin America would have been thrown back upon themselves There would have been no market for the sale of their produce nor any competent to supply their needs But the war did not produce such an effect and we who are optimists do not believe that it will notwithstanding what has happened in Russia and the partially disorganized state of Germany Yet the war did to a certain extent throw Latin America back on its own resources but not to any great degree nor so much as is generally believed It was difficult to secure all that was needed even at the advanced prices Some things at times were not procurable at all and the market for some products coffee and nitrate for example was at times re stricted The result was to give a stimulus to manufacture especially of 12THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE SITUATION IN SOUTH AMERICA textile goods and to lessen production of exportable products when markets were restricted But neither increased manufacture nor decreased agricultural and mining production assumed more than minor proportions The large movement was the other way towards stimulated agricultural and mining production and an increasing depend ence on the United States and Western Europe for manufactured products In the main these demands were met South America increased as far as it could the exportation of food of the same kinds it had always exported but and this is the more significant fact it began the exportation of foods it had not theretofore exported or produced such as beans and dairy products and it extended the area of its meat and grain production The war gave a start in South America to a more diver sified agricultural and grazing industry In fact the impulse was and is felt in all of its industries But on the whole the effect was not and will not prove to be any weakening of the interde pendence of South America on one side and the United States and Western Europe on the other Rather the two sides have become to a larger degree complementary In the distribution of the trade there were many changes Germany and the countries of the German group were shut off not of course because of any economic fact or reason but by the stern decree of the allied and opposing powers who ruled the Seas Not all the German trade was shut off a very considerable trickle passed back and forth through Holland and the Scandi navian countries However disturbing this last fact was to the war offices of the Allied powers it in no way af fected the economic situation of South America Many factors enter into the problem whether a country or a great section of the world is selfsustaining or may become so in the event of great stress such as the war brought about Under modern conditions no locality not even the most inaccessible portion of the globe is strictly speaking self sustaining Civilization tends towards making the world more and more interdependent Nevertheless certain countries could maintain a more or less even tenor of individual life although an impenetrable curtain were dropped to shut them off from all the rest of the world Such a country is the United States or China In a lesser degree Germany and France under the same condition might maintain their indus trial and social civilization without radically destructive changes On the other hand the whole founda tion and superstructure of industrial and social life of Great Britain or of Argen tinawould be uprooted and cast down if the country were thrown back upon it self A very little reflection will show the soundness of the observation and account for what at first glance may ap pear a fanciful grouping of the United States and China and Great Britain and Argentina Among the highly developed industrial countries espe cially of high manufacturing develop ment the United States is in the mat ter of selfdependence at one pole and Great Britain and Belgium at the other with France and Germany between Among the undeveloped or slightly de veloped countries and again with spe cial reference to manufacturing indus try China is in the main independent because its standard of living has not yet advanced to the point of requiring much of what it does not itself produce Like the United States it is independ ent but for a different reason South America is like England in that it has built its house upon the foundation of having and using what it does not produce It is also like England in 13THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY that it produces large excesses of the things which it does produce In the matter of dependency on foreign trade therefore South America stands with England although its industry is the exact antithesis of Englands To have shut South America off dur ing the war would have caused almost as disastrous an effect there as would have been caused in England had Germany succeeded in maintaining an impenetrable submarine cordon around the British Isles It would when the reserve stock of foreign goods was ex hausted have thrown all South Amer ica back to the stage of primitive agriculture living from hand to mouth Large production would have ceased the mines not have produced the herds of cattle would have starved or wan dered away to the forest the wheat and corn lands would have lain fallow coffee plantations would have grown to brush the cities would have emptied the railroads would have ceased to operate and only the simple handcrafts would have functioned for the mines the great herds of cattle horses and sheep the broad stretches of waving corn wheat flax and oats the thou sands of miles of green coffee trees in rows the plantations of cacao the mountains of rubber gathered from the forests the innumerable bales of hides skins and wool that crowd the docks all exist and have been called into being to supply a foreign demand A tithe or a tithe of a tithe of these things would supply South Americas own needs but none of them nor all together respond to the need for machinery tools rail way supplies hardware and the thou sand and one other articles of modern civilization which South America must have but does not make and can not improvise The war threw into high relief the dependency of South America on for eign trade incoming and outgoing but it did not alter or appreciably decrease this dependency What little it gained in independency by enlarged manu facture was more than offset by in creased production of the exportable products Furthermore it is more than doubtful whether increasing man ufacture in South America at the present time or for a long time to come does or will lead to a lesser dependence on foreign imports It broadens the field creates a demand for more tools and appliances and for raw material as in the case of cotton Es pecially does it create a demand for the secondary materials of manufacture the trimmings the fastenings the ornamentation the chemicals in short all of what one may call the fluxes of manufacture Not only did the war not lessen the dependency of South America on for eign trade it did not radically upset the destinations and derivations of this trade At the most it was a shifting within identical groups The chief and only considerable source of South American imports was the group of the United States Great Britain France Germany and Belgium and this group was the same that received South American exports In general Spain Italy Austria Holland the three Scandinavian countries and all others appearing in the statistical tables as having a part in South American trade did not enter seriously into the problem of competition Either their trade was specialized or it was small or it was transit With all the members of the chief group engaged in a life and death struggle that taxed and strained to the utmost their resources it might have been expected that the countries of the second group who remained neutral would have captured the South Ameri can trade Such has been the result of past wars and such some persons antici 14THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE SITUATION IN SOUTH AMERICA pated would be the result of this war These persons failed in understanding that while Sisyphus might roll a great stone it was Atlas alone who could bear the burden of the world Spain Holland and the other neutrals did not capture South American trade simply because they could not carry the load They had not the industrial plant sufficient to handle more than a very small fraction of South American produce nor could they from their own production supply the volume and al most infinite variety of South American imports They had not the skill the organization the material nor the personnel for such an undertaking Their industries were constituted to meet lesser requirements They did increase their trade up to the limit of the possible but the chief increase was a more or less disguised transit trade to the belligerent countries of the main group The chief effect of the war was a shifting within the main group Bel gium entirely and Germany almost entirely were shut off Imports from England and France decreased and exports of food products to the same countries remained the same or in creased Exports of industrial raw materials to France and England de creased The slack in every case was taken up by the United States What the other members of the group in cluding Germany and Belgium or what the neutral group could not supply the United States did What they could not buy it bought There was much talk in Europe and in South America of unfair advantages taken Here there was a complementary and provocative outcry from a like class that may be epitomized in one phrase Now is our opportunity In truth on both sides it was puerile chatter having no regard to the actualities of the case The war threw all international selling to the passive side He who had goods to sell did not need to cry his wares The buyer came to him South America which had always been both a passive seller and a passive buyer remained passive as to selling but it became active as to buying Not only South America but all the world was in the mad rush to buy Argentino Briton Frenchman and Hollander armies na vies government boards civilians all were in a scramble to buy buy The seller he who had was in the saddle all others trailed at his bridle rein He was not thinking of opportunities in the future His opportunity was the present and he drove it to the limit At the end the one enduring thought that remained in the mind of the buy ers was resentful This is why South America now cries loudly for the return of German trade It feels that although it was not in the war it has been made to pass through the Caudine Forks The resentment is chiefly towards the United States but in a lesser degree toward England The angry feeling will cool but it exists and must be reckoned with South America will come to appreciate the fact that the same causes that drove the prices up on what it had to buy also drove them up on some things it had to sell It will understand that economic dependence is correlative Before the war the exports of the twenty Latin American republics to the United States in 1913 478000000 was not far from being equal to the exports to both Great Britain and Germany 330000000 and 192000 000 Leaving out the exports of meat and grain from Argentina and Uru guay which the United States did not need and which therefore did not enter into the competitive trade and leaving out also the interstate trade the exports of industrial raw materials including wool hides tallow and 15THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY other byproducts of the meat industry and including also tropical foods cane sugar coffee cacao fruits etc to the United States were greater than the exports to Great Britain Germany and France combined After the close of the war 1919 France remained at about the same proportion and the United States and Great Britain to 1913 1919 1913 1919 not and is not nearly so great Al though on the export side it took more of South American industrial raw material and tropical foods than did England and twice as much as did Germany yet it was behind England in the whole export field and only 25 per cent ahead of Germany and on the im port side it was

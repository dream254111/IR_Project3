j100195,The Jewish Quarterly Review,1451278,The Jewish Law of Agency,i263243,THE JEWISH LAW OF AGENCY By ISRAEL HERBERT LEVINTHAL Brooklyn N Y INTRODUCTION THE JEWISH people have been credited by the world with having contributed more than any other people in the domain of Religion and Religious Morality Even the most stubborn of our opponents admit that Religion would not have been the force and the power in civilization that it is were it not for the Jew Few however know how much the Jew has contributed to other fields in the realm of human progress To Rome is given unstinted praise for her legal system and for her influence upon juristic develop ment No textbook on any legal topic fails to pay homage to Rome for her contribution in the field of law That she deserves most of this praise no one will doubt But that the Jew is deserving of more credit than he receives for his contribution in the field of law is realized by only a few When one delves in the pages of the Talmud and glimpses in the works of the later rabbis he marvels at the fine legal insight possessed by these ancient sages and at times he would almost be led to believe that he is study ing the laws of some modern and highly developed code Nay more he would begin to ask himself Is it possible that this ancient collection of laws that are so in consonance with the modern juristic spirit should have had no influence upon the systems of law that rule the peoples of today He would then undoubtedly come to the conclusion reached by President Woodrow Wilson when he said in his treatise on the State It would be a mistake however 117THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW to ascribe to Roman legal conceptions an undivided sway over the development of law and institutions during the Middle Ages The Teuton came under the influence not of Rome only but also of Christianity and through the Church there entered into Europe a potent leaven of Judaic thought The laws of Moses as well as the laws of Rome contributed suggestion and impulse to the men and institu tions which were to prepare the modern world and if we could but have the eyes to see the subtle elements of thought which constitute the gross substance of our present habit both as regards the sphere of private life and as regards the action of the state we should easily discover how much besides religion we owe to the Jew It is true that all ancient peoples have developed certain systems of law and in fact many are the laws that are found to be similar among them The eminent scholar and father of the study of Comparative Law Josef Kohler has even gone so far as to say The more we proceed in our study of humanity the clearer and the more evident it becomes to us that the whole human family despite national pecu liarities are actuated not only by similar instincts and desires but especially in law and in the development of public institutions they show the influence of similar cul tural forces2 But the more we study ancient law the more we come to the conclusion that in no other system has law so much in commcn with the modern development and nowhere are the true grounds and reasons of law so well declared as in the jurisprudence of the Jew The study of Jewish law is important not only because of its essentially modern conception of human rela tionship but also because by means of this study we get the clearest insight into the unconquerable spirit of the 1 Section 220 2 Ucber die Methode der Rechtsvergleichung in Gruenhuts Zeitschr Vol XXVIII p 273 118THE JEWISH LAW OF AGENCYLEVINTHAL Jewish people He who would endeavor to comprehend and to appreciate the national life of the Jew he who wants to understand the spirit which helped to create his divine literature must first become acquainted with the founda tion the groundwork upon which such a life was reared This foundation and groundwork is not as in the case of other peoples to be found in their land but in the law of Israel3 THE DISTINCTIVENESS OF JEWISH LAW What impresses the student of Jewish law even more than its similarity to the latest modern systems is the humane spirit that permeates the entire body of the law To do justice is the very purpose of all law but justice itself if carried to extremes may sometimes result in in justice Jewish law endeavors to be humane as well as just and therefore takes cognizance of the human element in all human relationship And it is this humane element that strikes a distinctive note and makes its strongest appeal even to the nonJewish student4 Perhaps this is due to the fact that among the Jews the distinction between religious and secular law was not known5 The division by scholars of the Mosaic and rabbinic legislation into moral ritual and legal laws is wholly arbitrary6 In fact the re ligious element plays a very important role in all ancient nature peoples and permeates every phase of their life Law and religion are to them one and the same thing Indeed law is but one of the many forms by means of which their religious ideas are put into effect7 In the 3 cf J L Saalschiitz Das Mosaische Recht Berlin 1853 p 13 4 cf Dr Josef Kohlers Introduction to Der Talmud und sein Recht by Dr Mordche W Rapaport Berlin 1912 p 4 Besonders wohltuend aber wirkt die Humanitat des jiidischen Rechts 5 Roman law does make this distinction in Jus and Fas cf Leopold Wenger Das Recht der Griechen

Rechtsgeschichte p 3 119THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW case of the Jew however his religion not only influenced his law but permeated its very structure His law was to him part and parcel of his religion and Kohler grasped the force of this truth when eulogizing Jewish law he exclaims Das Recht des alten Israel es war ein Sak ralrecht im h6chsten Sinne8 THE BASIS AND DEVELOPMENT OF JEWISH LAW At the outset we must endeavor to understand the basis and the development of all Jewish law Each and every law must be based upon and find its source in Holy Writ or at least in an oral tradition bearing upon an interpretation of the biblical word or phrase In the dis cussion of every law you will always find the expression Upon what Scriptural verse is it based The Talmud is not a code formulated by a legislative body nor does it of its own volition decree the law It derives its authority solely from the Scriptures and the interpretation of the biblical words is its principal function9 That does not mean that all Jewish laws are to be found in the Bible Postbiblical Jewish law most cer tainly went beyond Scripture New provisions had to be created to meet new conditions which could not have been foreseen The scribes and later the rabbis for political national and natural reasons endeavored to create by legal fictions by equity and by legislation a hedge around the Torah a chain of tradition Though in theory the legal canon was closed forever it did not in fact prevent the Jews from interpreting and developing their laws and precepts with lifegiving freedom But this interpretation and development was always centered about the Bible10 8 J Kohler ibid ch on Israelitisches Recht p 71 9 Cf Der Talmud und sein Recht by Dr M W Rapaport p 4 10 N Isaacs ibid p 4 cf Sir Henry Maine Ancient Law ch 2 for a discussion of the agencies by which law in general is brought into harmony with the progress of society The same instrumentalities operated in the development of Jewish law 120THE JEWISH LAW OF AGENCYLEVINTHAL Especially is this true in the case of the Civil Law The development here presents a remarkable contrast to that of the Criminal Law While the latter retained all through the course of existence its Mosaic character the former was practically a talmudic edifice reared on Mosaic principles But this contrast is explained easily enough Criminal and capital laws are closely connected with the existence of an independent state civil laws enjoy a certain independence of political conditions autonomy itself offers an ample field for the growth of the latter And as the Jews continued to enjoy their autonomy for a long time in Palestine and especially in Babylon after their right to practise their criminal law was taken from them their civil system continued to develop after the destruction of the state with ever increasing vigor In fact it reached its culmination in Babylon1l The Bible itself contains comparatively very few civil laws and even those mentioned are not stated explicitly but casually Contracts and obligations are hardly touch ed upon The only laws sufficiently expounded are those of damages guardians and inheritance It is evident that the civil laws mentioned in the Pentateuch were adjusted to an agricultural community living in the small circle of its family possessions without practising much com merce or industry As soon as the family circles were broken and intercourse and commerce spread the few pre scribed laws proved insufficient and a system of civil laws had to be constructed It is possible that under these conditions Jewish civil law was somewhat influenced by the system of more commercial nations such as the Baby n It is for the same reason that one may note that Philo in his discussion of Jewish law is more in conformity with the rabbis in civil law than in criminal law The latter was not permitted to be practised by the Jews in his day and so he was dealing with theory alone and there he was often the preacher or philosopher instead of the legalist In his discussion of the civil law he was in agreement with the rabbis because that was actually practised and he could not therefore interpret it differently 121THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW lonians with whom they came in contact During the second Temple the civil law kept on developing according to the life conditions usages and rules of conduct of the age adapting and modifying usages of other legal systems most likely the Roman12 As already stated the Jews practised their own civil law even after the loss of their sovereignty and it continued its development reaching the height of its glory in the Babylonian period In later years attempts were made to collect in syste matic fashion the manifold legal decisions scattered through out the pages of the Talmud One of the first and foremost of these codes or digests of the law was the Mishneh Torahor the Yad haHazakah of Maimonidesl3 in which the author strives to state the law as the Talmud has it and in which he also mentions certain cases which show the later develop ment of the law The next great work of systematizing talmudic law is the Tur a code of law written about 1340 by Jacob ben Asher14 Finally must be mentioned the Shulhan Aruk of Joseph Caro15 which again endeavors to give a clear and concise statement of Jewish law The law in these codes however must be studied carefully in order to know which may be traced to talmudic sources as in the interim between the Talmud and the Shulhan Aruk Jewish law continued to grow and to develop DIFFICULTY IN STUDYING TALMUDIC LAW When we compare the Jewish law of the Talmud with the Roman law one thing must be said to the advantage of the latter Roman law is a model of system and arrange 12 Cf M Waxman Civil and Criminal Procedure of Jewish Courts Seminary Annual 1914 p 263 For arguments endeavoring to prove that the rabbis did not consult and were not influenced by the Roman law see Hirsch B Fassel Das Mosaisch Rabbinische Civilrecht Vol I p 6 f 13 Rabbi Moses ben Maimon Arabic name Abu Imran Musa ben Maimun ibn Abd Allah b 1135 in Cordova d 1204 in Cairo cf J Encycl IX p 73 14 12801340 cf J Encycl VII 27 15 14881575 cf J Encycl III 585 122THE JEWISH LAW OF AGENCYLEVINTHAL ment It was a guide for the actual life of its citizens General principles of law only are given and it was the function of the judge to decide the detailed case before him upon these stated principles In the Talmud however the reverse is the truth System and arrangement are lacking The Talmud is not a code of general legal principles but rather a compilation of discussions of de tailed and specific cases of law Furthermore it must be remembered that the Talmud is not a legal work alone but comprises many other subjects The legal subjects treated therein are therefore not sys tematized and arranged in certain parts but scattered throughout the many volumes and their pages The same subject may often be discussed in various sections and un der different headings16 It is because of this difficulty that so few attempts have been made to treat the legal topics of the Talmud and that many of those which have been made contain conclusions and deductions that are erroneous and fallacious It must furthermore be remem bered that most of those who hitherto wrote on the law of the Talmud were theologians rather than jurists and theo logians not altogether free from prejudice and bias17 The day has come when this interesting branch of study should engross the attention not only of theologians but of lawyers and jurists as well especially those students who realize the importance of the study of Comparative Juris prudence They will then find that what was said by Hale the distinguished English jurist with reference to Roman law might equally well be said of Jewish law He set himself much  says Bishop Burnet his biographer to the study of the Roman law and though he liked the 16 For a study of the contents and system of the Talmud cf H Strack Einleitung in den Talmud M Mielziner Introduction to the Talmud 17 For an exhaustive analysis of works by Christian authors treating erroneously Jewish law see Die Rechte der Israeliten Athener und Romer by Dr Samuel Mayer Leipzig 1862 p 3 ff 123THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW way of judicature in England yet he often said that the true grounds and reasons of law were so well delivered in the Digests that a man could never understand law as a science so well as by seeking it there and lamented much that it was so little studied in England18 THE LAW OF AGENCY MEANING AND SCOPE OF SUBJECT Agency in its broader sense includes every relation in which one person acts for or represents another by his authority This is not the sense in which it is endeavored in this paper to study the Jewish law of Agency Such an inquiry would be too broad in its scope and would include studies in guardianship bailments letting and hiring trust and partnership wherever one may act in the interest of another without being technically his agent19 Here we shall limit ourselves to the more restricted sense in which the term is used in the AngloAmerican law and shall deal with the relations established when a person known as the agent is authorized to represent and act for another known as the principal and does so represent and act for him thereby legally binding the principal in his connection with a third person and also with the relations established when a representative is vested with authority to perform operative or mechanical duties for his principal not intend ing to create any new legal relations between him and third persons but simply acting for his benefit or interests alone20 In other words we shall deal with the subject as understood in the modern law under the headings of prin cipal and agent and master and servant 18 Quoted by James Bryce in The Academical Study of the Civil Law Macmillan 1871 p 61 19 Though the Tur and Shulhan Aruk Hoshen Misphat 186 12 include con ditional sales in their chapters on Agency 20 Mechems Agency p 5 6 124THE JEWISH LAW OF AGENCYLEVINTHAL The person who serves a principal in this relation is his agent known in Jewish law as nl Shaluah or nt Shaliah one who is sent21 the person who sends or who authorizes the Shalia to represent him is usually termed LnI the Meshallea or nOiV Sholeah one who causes to be sent or one who sends the relation created between the two is known as nlnr Shelihut or agency DISTINCTION BETWEEN AGENCY AND OTHER LEGAL RE LATIONS It is sometimes quite difficult to determine whether a certain contract creates the ordinary relation of principal and agent or a special relation covered by some of the other branches of the law as for instance the relation of partner ship A partner is also an agent but his agency is of a special and peculiar character Maimonides for instance felt the closeness of the legal relationship to such an extent that he joins the laws of both of these subjects under one headingHilkot Sheluhin weshutafin22 As in the English law23 so also in the Jewish it is safe to say that it becomes a question of construction upon the whole agreement and the intention of the parties will be the controlling consi 21 I am indebted to Prof Louis Ginzberg for the suggestion that these two terms are not altogether synonymous but that originally there was a distinction between them The term mrltV shaluah is the participle of nir and denotes one who is sent and would refer to anyone sent or appointed to do a certain act The term rPiV shaliah on the other hand would be the technical designation of Agent of one who was recog nized to hold that position regularly for a principal cf Baba Kamma IX 5 for an ex cellent example where the Mishnah is careful in noting this distinction H1l 13 In7 f K7 Jn ni rriP Imi3 K llinmtr7  The Mishnah here uses mllt when it refers to the mans representative appointed by him simply to receive for him the stolen property it uses PIM when it refers to the Courts representative to the one holding the office of agent for the Bet Din So too it is worth noting that the expression 1 r1n mI7 referring to the technical Court agent never occurs Cf also Yoma 14 for another example showing this distinction 22 Cf Kiddushin 41a where the Talmud already noticed the nearness of the rela tionship between partnership and agency and where it in fact hints that partnership is a special form of agency 23 Burdick on Partnership p 59 195 E W Huffcutt The Law of Agency 2d ed p 7 Crintorl v Strong 148 Ill 587 Wright v Davidson 13 Minn 449 125THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW deration as to whether an agency or some other special relation is created AGENCY BELONGS TO COMMERCIAL AGE Accepting our definition of agency it will at once be seen that it belongs to a condition of society in which com mercial transactions are highly developed A noncom mercial society while it might have much use for servants would have little need of agents empowered to represent the principal in business dealings with third persons It is for that reason that in the English Common Law Agency as a separate subject is a matter of late development24 In fact the very title Agency is of modern origin Blackstone scarcely refers to it The Law of principal and agent says oneof Blackstones most learned editors Prof Hammond is derived from the canon law and has only been introduced in the common law in recent times Principal and Agent does not occur in Viners Abridgement or those preceding it and it is only at the end of the 18th century that we find it beginning to appear as a separate title as yet of very limited applications25 The index of Reeves History of English Law contains no reference either to Agency or to Principal and Agent So too Sir Henry Maine has no reference to this subject in his Ancient Law That the early Roman Law was destitute of the modern notion of Agency is admitted by Mr Hunter who at tempts to explain it with the statement It must be remembered that the absence of Agency characterizes every department of the ancient law26 24 Mechem  10 25 Hammonds Blackstone Bk I p 719 Cf I Blackstone Comm 427 0 W Holmes History of Agency in Select Essays AngloAmer Legal Hist Vol III p 398 26 Hunters Roman Law 4th ed p 609 Roman law was very slow to recognize the idea of representation and the sphere within which it was applied remained through out a restrictive one Cf The Institutes by Rudolph Sohm 1907 p 220 also Mitteis Die Lehre von der Stellvertretung nach romischen Recht 1885 p 9 ff 126THE JEWISH LAW OF AGENCYLEVINTHAL But Mr Hunter in this sweeping assertion fails to note the one important exception the Jewish Law Not only does Maimonides know and deal with the specific term of Shelihut Agency but even the rabbis of the Talmud frequently speak of the Shaliah the agent and the Meshalleah or Sholeah the principal and show their complete understanding of the importance of this legal relationship CLASSIFICATION OF AGENTS Some modern jurists make a distinction between the relation of principal and agent and that of master and servant27 It is often said that the distinction lies in the fact that an agent is vested with discretion while a servant is not28 According to Huffcutt29 the difference between the agent and the servant is not that one hasdiscretion and the other has not but depends upon whether his authority is to do an act which results in a contractual obligation with a third party or not In the first instance he is an agent in the second he is the servant30 If we would apply Huffcutts theory to Jewish law a man sent by the principal to deliver to his wife a get a bill of divorce would be an agent if however the man was vested with authority to drive a horse to a designated place he would be a servant But it must be noted that Jewish law makes no such distinction In both of the above instances Jewish law would designate the party 27 So the Roman law speaks of procurator representative and nuntius messenger 28 XXVIII Am Law Rev 9 22 Sohm in his Institutes puts the distinction thus A messenger is merely a conduit pipe for conveying my will a representative is a person who wills instead of me 29 Agency p 18 30 He gives the following illustration as proof of his theory A railroad conductor is not an agent merely because he is vested with a wide discretion as to the manage ment of his train He is a servant as long as his authority is to do an act not resulting in contractual obligation if vested with authority to engage employees then he is an agent So a representative authorized to sell a horse at a specified price to a speci fied person for cash is not a servant merely because he has no discretion as to the terms of the sale his act results in a contractual obligation and he is therefore an agent 127THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW vested with authority as the Shalia agent31 And it is interesting to note that while modern textbooks do speak of agent and servant legal writers of renown minimize the distinction and evidently agree with the Jewish law that in legal essence there is no difference between the relation of master and servant and that of principal and agent The terms they say are fundamentally interchangeable and the distinction between them evidential only32 Modern writers in treating the theme of Agency also make a distinction between general agents and special agents the first applying when the agent has authority to act for his principal in all matters the second applying when the agent is authorized to act for his principal only in a single specific transaction Jewish law makes no such distinction and again it is worth noting that the more advanced authorities are in agreement with the Jew ish view33 Jewish law makes only the following distinctions or rather classifications in the field of agency It speaks of the ninD Sarsor literally a broker or middleman but which is defined by Maimonides and the later codes as a ShaliaJ or agent who receives pay for his labors in the principals behalf34 The Bah35 makes a very striking dis tinction between the word Sarsor as used by Maimonides in connection with agency and the word nD1D Sarser also 31 Many cases discussed in the modern textbooks under the heading of Master and Servant would in Jewish law find their place under the specified subject of Laws of Hiring nIrvDt 32 XXVIII Am Law Rev 9 IV Harvard Law Review 345 and V Harv Law Rev 1 articles by Holmes Historically of course the law of principal and agent is an outgrowth and expansion of the law of master and servant Cf Kingan v Silvers 13 Ind App 80 Mechem  8 33 The distinction given by writers referring to terms general and special in agency is a vague one and often leads to more confusion than it cures Writers do not agree as to the distinction itself much less as to its legal effects Huffcut ibid p 19 34 Maimonides Sheluhim 116 Tur and Shulhan Aruk Hoshen Mishpat 185 1 35 Bayit Hadash commentary on the Tur by R Joel Sirkes b at Lublin 1561 d Cracow 1640 cf J Enc XI 397 to Tur 181 1 128THE JEWISH LAW OF AGENCYLEVINTHAL used by him in his discussion of Sales36 The former he suggests means agent the latter means a broker a middle man or commissioner37 called in the Talmud nrpD Safsira broker38 The Sarser is subject to the same laws as an ordinary purchaser and not as the Sarsor or agent Hence if a principal said to his Sarsor or agent Sell for me my pin for 100 and he sold it for 200 the extra money received would belong to the principal39 but if a Sarser were told to sell for 100 and the article brought more the surplus would belong to the broker40 From the definition of Sarsor as given by Maimonides that he is the paid agent we would infer that the general term Shaliah agent as used in the Jewish law refers to a gratuitous agent alone41 While there is this distinction between the Sarsor and the Shaliah viz that the former is a paid agent and the latter is a gratuitous agent the legal consequence of their relation to the principal and to the third party is the same with the one exception the question of the agents liability to the principal for loss or damages suffered by him42 I believe that it would be more correct to say that the term Shalia is the general or inclusive term of agency and is used when we speak of rules applying both to the paid and to the gratuitous ones while the term Sarsor is used when we speak of the rules applying to the 36 Maim Hilkot Mekirah ch 7 37 Jastrows Talmudic Dictionary translates ID0D broker middleman agent thus making no distinction between them 10DD he translates agentthe reverse of the Bahs suggestion While the Bahs suggestion has force in connection with Mai monides use of the terms and also in connection with the use by later rabbis Jastrow seems to be correct in his interpretation as used in the Talmud Cf Jerusalem Talmud Aboda Zarah 1 39c WKlf 1D1D01 D3p lD117D he fined the broker and they called him a man that serves as a Roman agent 38 Cf B Mesia 42b 39 See below p 135 o Cf Bah Tur 181 1 l1 According to Roman law agency must be gratuitous otherwise it would be Locatio et Conductio letting to hire Digest XVII 1 6 cf S F Harris Elements of Roman Law 1875 P 145 42 See below p 176 129THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW paid agent alone In their legal effect there is absolutely no difference with the exception just noted43 There is a third type of agency spoken of in Jewish law niniW harshaah44 literally an authorization author ity or power of attorney and refers mostly to cases where the agent has a written power of attorney nni naO to represent his principal in court bringing an action in his behalf to recover money land or goods that belong to him45 While harshaah is used mostly in connection with court action it does not limit itself to that and may be used as written authority in ordinary agency to collect from the third party an article belonging to or a debt due to the principal46 The main difference between harshaah and shelihut then is this that the latter would refer to all contracts of agency while the former would be used only to collect a debt or in an action to secure a certain article from a bailee or trustee belonging to the principal There is also a practical difference between ordinary sheliut and harshaah It will be shown later that the death of the principal revokes at once all agency47 Now suppose Reu ben sends Simeon to collect from Levi a debt due him or 43 Rabbenu Jeroham distinctly said that the laws of Sarsor and Shaliah in business transactions are exactly the same Quoted by Bet Yosef commentary by Joseph Caro to Tur 185 1 44 Ketub 95a Shebu 31a 45 The term harshaah is derived from the Hiphil form of the verb TV1 to have power which originally was used in connection with the power to claim a debt cf Targum Onkelos to Deut 24 10 where the words ly l1rn I are translated VIln lN fll12 So also in Assyrian Eresu means a claim Harshaah then would mean the givng of authority or power to claim a debt It refers however to written authority alone though the word t3iy written document is ofttimes to be understood cf Shebu 31a The principal or the one who gives the Harshaah is termed the 1I7o Marsheh the agent to whom it is given is known as the ltlt3 Mursheh sometimes also as the MBlqIL KC he who comes with a harshaah 46 Cf Sh Ar Hosh Mish 122 13 According to the Roman civil law the cred itor in an obligation cannot transfer or assign his rights to another But he may by a Mandatum Actionis constitute the other his procurator or processual agent for purposes of the action i e he may commission the other to sue as his agent for the amount due under the obligation and may further agree by what is called a Man datum In Rem Suam to let the agent retain the sum recovered in the action Cf R Sohm I c p 221 The Mandatum Actionis would be similar to the harshaah 47 See below p 170 130THE JEWISH LAW OF AGENCYLEVINTHAL to take from him an article of his held by Levi suppose further that before Simeon performs his mission Reuben dies Levi not knowing of Reubens death pays the money to Simeon If Simeon would then lose the money Levi would be responsible to Reubens heirs for the amount If however Reuben in the same case gives Simeon a harshaah Levi could pay him the money even after Reu bens death and Simeon would assume all responsibility The harshaah in legal effect transfers or assigns the claim itself to the agent and hence the death of the principal has no effect48 Hence the third party if he so desired has a right to refuse to acknowledge an ordinary agent sent to collect from him a debt while he must recognize the Mursheh49 It is interesting to review briefly the historical de velopment of harshaah50 From the Talmud and Mai monides it can be seen that its use was gieatly restrict ed Originally it was not to be used in the case of a debt or in the case where an article was sought from a bailee the possession or title of which was denied by him51 It was not given in the case of a debt even where there was documentary evidence of the loan on the principle that the identical money loaned could not be traced and D31y Nl 3 v  t rpD 2rTR 1S a man cannot give possession transfer to his neighbor of that which does not exist52 48 Sh Ar Hosh Mish 122 1 cf below p 171 49 Ibid 50 For an ingenious explanation of the origin of the institution of harshaah see Das Jiidische ObligationesRecht by Dr Leopold Auerbach Berlin 1871 p 567f 51 Baba Kamma 70a Maim Sheluhin III 6 It must be noted that the Talmud ibid discusses only the question of harshaah in relation to Personal Property as in the case of Real Property there is no doubt that harshaah could be given In the case of Real Property ownership was the allimportant matter and implied the notion of possession even though possession was temporarily denied him 52 Maim III 7 cf BabaBatra 157a The distinction must be noted between the do cumentary evidence of an oral debt which was simply an I O U paper not sealed nor attested by witnesses and a Zln lt3t writing of debt a sealed bond i e an acknowl edgement of debt attested by two or more witnesses The latter operates in Jewish 131THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW The Geonim however saw the hardships caused by this rule in that it discouraged loans and ruled that in the case of loans where there was written evidence of the debt harshaah could be given even where the debt was denied53 but it was still not allowed in the case of debts arising by parol It was only later with the development of trade and business that the rabbis allowed harshaah to be used in all cases in debts arising from verbal as well as written con tractes and in disputed cases of bailment as well as where possession was admitted54 It is interesting to note that the rabbis limit the MursFeh to represent the plaintiff only55 The principal reason for compelling the defendant to appear in person seems to have been the feeling that if he were obliged to face the plaintiff in open court there would be slighter probability of false plea or concealment of the truth on his part56 Besides the plaintiff is supposed to have positive right to tangible things whether property or money and such rights can be transferred to an agent by the normal act of kinyan while the defendant has only verbal answers which cannot be transferred so that his representative is only a lawyer and such an office did not find favor in legal understanding as a mortgage from the time of its delivery of all the debtors land wherever situated In the case of a 1n 1 N31t sealed bond harshaah could always be given as may be seen already from a Tannaitic source Kidd 47b for the reason that the bond itself is something tangible and concrete and also because it carries with it subjected property lt 11Uyltl 1IpD 1IP WD i e a judgment on this bond may be levied on all real property of the debtor sold or pledged to others after the delivery of said bond Cf B B 75b 77a 77b Maim III 7 Harshaah could not be given for the purpose of securing an oath from a third party because it was limited to cases dealing with claims of tangible things not where the claim was for mere words Cf Maim III 7 53 Tosafot Bab Kam 70a quoting R Hananel and R Tam cf also Maim ibid Kesef Mishneh commentary to Maim by Joseph Caro ibid 64 Hosh Mish 123 1 The earlier authorities did not favor the institution of harshaah as may be seen from the statement of the

which means that one who acts through an agent is in law regarded as if he does the act himself and also that what a man may do in person he may also in most instances do through a representative Jewish law carries this principle to its logical conclusion and shows how far more advanced and more modern it is than the law of Rome While the latter declares that no acquisition of property could be made by a free person for the benefit of another60 the following passages cited from 57 The Rosh R Asher ben Jehiel b Germany 1250 d Toledo 1328 wrote an abstract of all Talmudic laws cf J Enc II p

would seem that the reverse was the truth and that the statement Let the priest be represented by an entlar was merely an hypothetical suggestion offered which was quickly answered by the remark that he cannot because an oath may have to be administered On the other hand the Rashba quoted in the 71HW rlI ibid interprets the passage to the effect that while no express n3pn rule can be stated that the priest must be represented by an Entlar yet if he desires to be so repre sented in a matter where no oath will be administered he may do so The Beer ha Golah seems to be of the like opinion In either case it must be noted that the insti tution of entlar is of a later development as its Greek origin signifies cf Aruch Com pletum It was probably borrowed from Greek or Roman law and never received any widespread sanction in Babylonia since we have no mention of it in the Baby Ionian Talmud nor an equivalent Hebrew or Aramaic name The Rosh in Shebu ch 4 mentions the fact that it was a disputed point among the earlier authorities whether the Entlar came under the rules of agency or under special laws applying to him alone 69 Kiddushin 41b Nazir 12b Nedarim 72b That this is a very old established legal maxim can be seen from the fact that it is already used as a legal term in the Mishnah Cf Berakot 34b though there used in connection with a discussion of a question of ritual The Common Law also rests upon the like principleQui facit per alium facit per se Coke Littleton 1258a 60 Sheldon Amos The History and Principles of the Civil Law of Rome 1883 p 137 To the early Roman law as to the early German law it seemed inconceivable that a134 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW the Tur will show to what length the principle was followed by the former If Reuben says to Simeon TV  p1rt Buy something for me and Simeon buys NnnDD without stating whether he purchases it for himself or for someone else then in that case Reuben acquires possession nil 1ln from the very moment of delivery61 And even if Simeon purchases the article with his own money he can not once the article has been delivered to him claim that he meant to purchase it for himself It is Reuben who ac quires possession and the article belongs to him it is he who can sue and be sued on the transaction and not the agent62 person should acquire rights or liabilities by means of a form to which he had not been a party As regards slaves and filii familias it is true that whatever they acquired they acquired by the necessary operation of law by virtue of the potestas for their superior But the civil law steadily refused to admit that rights could be acquired through a free representative Per liberam personam nobis adquiri nihil potest Later during the Empire acquisition by a procurator i e a freely chosen representa tive in the name of the principal was allowed As regards contracts however the rule remained unaltered that is to say it continued to be held that contractual rights and liabilities could only accrue to the contracting party himself and that contracts could not be validly concluded in the name of the third party Cf R Sohm 1 c p 220f 61 From Bab Kam 102b bot n1I 7yh lr i3p v 1n yh lyTli D 3 we would infer that the 3Y0 3 Palestinian view was that the third party must know that the agent acts in behalf of a principal thus agreeing with the Roman view while the Babylonian opinion holds that the agent may also act in behalf of an undisclosed principal Upon closer examination however it appears that the Palestinian view also permits acts in behalf of an undisclosed principal the only case in which their claim is that the principal must be known is where there is a lPW change in the per formance where the agency is broken off by a noncompliance of principals request For instance where principal asks agent to purchase wheat and instead he purchases barley there the Palestinian view is that the principal must be disclosed to allow the latter to take advantage of the bargain Cf Rosh ibid 62 Hosh Mish 183 4 Moyle Institutes of Justinian gives this as the test of true agency To what extent is it possible for B to make a contract with C for A so that assuming of course that B discloses the fact of his agency and his principals name and does not exceed his instruction A alone acquires rights against and can sue C C acquires rights against and can sue A and B neither acquires rights nor incurs liabilities under the contract The above case is in conformity with this test The Roman method of procedure in such a case is very clumsy Moyle puts the matter thus If A being at Rome wishes to buy a house belonging to C at Naples he would give B at Naples a mandate to buy it for him B does so and then assigns his rights against C to A Cs rights against B e g his claim for the purchase money can be made available against A only by a novation that is to say a distinct stipulation from A that he will pay C for B if this is not done C if necessary must recover from B by actio venditi and B from A by actio mandati contraria an action to recover the money which B has laid out for him Here then none of the conditions above specified are realized and it should be noted that B is in fact the principal and the true vendor throughout and the only person who is entitled and bound in that capacity Accoroing to later Roman law it was different when res corporeales were actuallyTHE JEWISH LAW OF AGENCYLEVINTHAL Another and a still more striking case will prove how logically they clung to the legal fiction that a persons agent is in legal effect the person himself If Reuben says to Simeon Sell for me this article for 400 Simeon succeeds in getting 600 for the article to whom does this extra profit belong Unhesitatingly the rabbis decide that it belongs to Reuben because as soon as Simeon re ceived the money in payment it were as if Reuben himself had received it with his own hand for nrly i n 01p a1mp the agent stands but in the place of the principal63 WHENCE THE DOCTRINE IS DERIVED As was said above64 rabbinic law was based upon the Scriptures Talmudical law hardly knew the meaning of direct legislation but concerned itself with the development of the law of the Torah Agency had become a necessity in the developed life of the community It was important therefore to find the doctrine of agency in the Pentateuch And so the rabbis seriously discussed the question mnlni 15 whence is the doctrine of agency derived65 upon what Scriptural word or phrase is it based And it is worth while to record here in brief their ingenious but always logical interpretation We must derive it says the Tal mud from the word nMi and he sendeth her out66 used in connection with the husbands giving his wife a bill of divorce Scripture might have said wtnZl and he giveth her a divorce but expressly used the word nnil the same root as in the term ns to teach us that the husband can appoint an agent to deliver the bill delivered Then the agent could take possession for his principal But according to the older Roman law even this was not possible for the maxim held good per extra neam personam acquiri non potest a Tur ibid 185 13 This refers to the case where the article has no fixed market value For further discussion of this case see below p 181 64 Above p 120 65 Kidd 41a and b 66 Deut 241 135THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW of divorce unto his wife and hence that a man may appoint an agent to act in his behalf The rabbis then ask Scrip ture could have said rnit why does it say nmbr to teach us that the wife though she is only a passive character in the matterthe husband alone being the active party in divorce proceedingscan likewise appoint an agent to receive her bill of divorce From the fact that the Bible in the same context67 repeates the word nnrmtv we may de duce the rule that an agent may appoint a subagent68 The Rabbis then want to know whence agency may be derived in the case of marriage for according to Jewish law a man may marry i e become betrothed lDrmN through an agent69 We cannot make an analogy from the case of divorce because the latter suggests a distinct difference inasmuch as it is a case of nnnD y compulsion The wifes consent is not necessary in the matter of divorce we would therefore say that here agency applies but in the case of marriage it does not In answer to this the rabbis refer to the two words in the same verse70 n1fCW and nm she departeth and she becometh another mans wife and make a comparison between the two Just as in the case of her departing i e divorce an agent may be created to represent the principal so also in the case when she becometh the mans wife i e marriage an agent also may be appointed to represent him The rabbis then ask We learned that in the case of nnin the gift offerings that were to be set aside for the priest an agent may set aside the gift for his principal Whence do we 67 Deut 243 68 See later p 154 69 Below p 157 In rabbinic times there were two distinct stages in the marriage ceremony 1 the Betrothal erusin or acquisition and 2 the marriage proper nissuin the latter consisting in conducting the bride to the grooms permanent or improvised home The betrothal carries with it almost all the legal consequences of marriage It is the act of betrothal which might also be performed by proxies appointed by either the bride or by the groom or by both 70 Deut 242 136THE JEWISH LAW OF AGENCYLEVINTHAL derive that agency is to be allowed here We cannot infer this from the case of divorce because the latter is an in stance of lin a secular matter here we would say agency is permissible but in the case of Terumah which is a sacred matter we would say that agency cannot apply We de rive the law answers the Talmud from the seemingly superfluous word Da also in the verse Dnt a Irnn Ip Thus ye also shall set apart71 and from this m3 also we infer that agency applies here too The rabbis then produce another instance where agency is recognized viz the case of nn 1IP the offering of the Paschal lamb Again they note that we cannot infer it from divorce because that is a secular matter and here is mtWrp matter belonging to the realm of sanctity It is deduced they tell us from the Scriptural verse referring to the slaying of the Paschal lamb n rw nry 7np  i nli linrw and the whole congregation of Israel shall kill it 72 This verse does not mean says R Joshua b Korhah that the entire congre gation had to kill it one only did the slaying but the Bible regards the act as done by and in behalf of the entire congregation and thus we learn from Scripture that the act of the agent is the act of his principal The Talmud proceeds in this manner endeavoring to infer one case from the other but comes to the conclusion that each case possesses some distinctive feature and must therefore find its own source in the Bible73 FORMATION OF THE RELATION OF PRINCIPAL AND AGENT There are various ways in which the legal relation of 71 Numb 1828 For another inference from this word see below note 123 72 Exodus 126 The three instances of divorce marriage and sacrifices form a combination from which all other cases of agency may in fact be derived We have there the ordinary case of agency and the exceptional cases where no consent is neces sary and where it pertains to sacred matters The case of Terumah may be dispensed with for while it is a sacred matter compared to divorce it is secular in comparison to sacrifices 73 For an elaborate account of biblical proofs that lmll D tR I lIM9t compare Sifre Zutta Ed S Horovitz 1910 p 87 88 137THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW principal and agent may be created 1 by mutual agree ment 2 by estoppel and 3 by subsequent ratification74 1 BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT The relation of agency in Jewish law as in modern law is created immediately upon the authorization of the agent by the principal to do for him a certain act and the acceptance of this authorization or appointment by the agent either by express words or by proceeding upon the performance of the act so authorized75 2 BY ESTOPPEL The modern doctrine of estoppel may also be noted in the Jewish law of agency The principal has the power to revoke his agents authority to act in his behalf at any time he may so deem fit76 But suppose A held out B to be his agent to collect a certain debt due him from C and before B collected the debt A revoked his agency suppose furthermore C not knowing of the revocation paid the debt to B then A has no further claim upon C77 His revocation in so far as it related to C can have no effect and A is estopped from proving it because C can claim that not having knowledge to the contrary he had the right to rely upon the presumption that the principal had not revoked his authority78 The theory of estoppel is based upon the desire to do justice so that where one of two parties must suffer he who at first held out the agent as his and thus led others to believe that he was acting with full authority in his principals behalf should be the 74 So also in the EnglishAmerican law cf Huffcut p 23 Agency by necessity or by operation of law the gesetzlicher Vertreter of the German Civil Code would come under the heading of 1 nrl nTlt agent appointed by court not discussed here as it comes under the law of DOIlDIDt guardianship 75 Maim ibid I 1 Tur ibid 182 4 Sh Ar ibid 182 1 76 Below p 168 77 HoshMish 122 2 78 Cf 7laL C  Hosh Mish ibid cf also below p 190 138THE JEWISH LAW OF AGENCYLEVINTHAL one to suffer rather than the party who was absolutely in nocent It is no surprise then that the same theory should be applied in Jewish law And so we note the case that where Reuben gives Simeon a power of attorney to sue Levi for a debt due him and Levi goes to court with Simeon but judgment is given in Levis favor Reuben cannot now come and claim that he had revoked Simeons power to represent him before the suit began and that therefore the judgment should be set aside79 As another example of agency by estoppel may be noted the mpn decree of R Gamaliel the Elder that a husband who sends a bill of divorce by an agent should not revoke it unless knowledge of revocation is given either to wife or to agent the reason for such decree being lyn plpn 3n public policy80 The clearest case of the formation of the relation by estoppel is the following When A in the presence of B says to C I am Bs agent and B remains silent B will after wards be estopped from denying As agency81 3 BY RATIFICATION The English Common Law has recognized the theory of agency by ratification Briefly the rule may be stated thus Where one person whether no agent at all or an agent exceeding his authority does an act as agent in the name of or on behalf of another the person in whose name or on whose behalf the act was done may ratify the act and thereby give to it the same legal effect as if the one doing it had been in fact an agent or being an agent for some purposes had been in fact authorized to do the act in question82 Does the Jewish law of agency recognize 79 Hosh Mish 122 3 80 Gittin 32a 33a 81 Gloss 11i to Rosh Kidd 45b 82 Dempsey vs Chambers 154 Mass 330 The theory is based upon the maxim Omnis ratihabitio retrotrahitur et mandato priori aecquiparatur Every ratification relates back and is equivalent to prior authority 139THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW this rule83 While the rabbis do not give concrete cases bearing upon this phase of the subject it can be shown that the principle was not foreign to them In fact there is a doctrine frequently stated in rabbinic law which recognizes the fundamental principle upon which the theory of ratification is based r3n tIw Dr prt you may obtain a privilege or benefit in behalf of a person in his absence84 Accepting this principle it would appear that where A purchased a piece of land in behalf of and in the name of B B not having appointed A as his agent at all yet when B learns of the purchase he may ratify the act that this ratification will relate back and will be equivalent to a prior authority B will be able to sue and be sued upon the transaction The important element in the principle of ratification is that the wouldbe agent must do the act in the name of and in behalf of the person he desires to represent If however he makes the contract or deal in his own name not purporting to act on behalf of a prin cipal but having a secret intention to act though without authority for a principal the contract so made cannot be ratified by the undisclosed principal85 It is this element especially that the rabbis recognize and discuss The Tur86 gives the following case which may be in point Desiring to prove that by the agents acquisition of property in behalf of the principal when he was told by the principal to purchase it for him the property already belongs to the principal and the agent cannot afterwards claim that he made a mistake and had meant to purchase it for him self87 the Tur makes this additional significant assertion If the agent purchases the article in the name of Reuben 83 C M Simmons in his article on Talmudic Law of Agency J Quart Rev VIII p 621 merely puts the question and answers that it is not definitely decided without giving any proof one way or the other 84 Erubin 81b afr 86 Huffcut 1 c p 43 Cf Principal case Keighly v Durant 1901 App Cas 240 86 Ibid 183 4 87 Cf above p 134 140THE JEWISH LAW OF AGENCYLEVINTHAL then even if he gives his own money for the purchase price he cannot later claim that he purchased the article for himself once nro the act of transference had taken place and he accepted the article in the name of Reuben It is true that the Tur in making this statement meant it to apply to the former case where the agent was appointed by his principal Nevertheless I believe that from the wording of this statement of the law especially the em phasis upon the condition that even if he used his own private money as the purchase price the rabbis would follow the theory of ratification A still clearer case in point is the following which even goes beyond the modern accepted theory of ratifica tion where the notion is that the third party does not know that the agent has no authority to act If A comes to sue C for a debt the latter owes to B without having the nrwnn harshaah or power of attorney the proof of his agency without which he cannot force C to go to court88 then even though he is at present not Bs agent at all never theless if he offers to guarantee that he will later get the harshaah or authorization from B C must recognize him and answer him in court for we accept the principle lzr 13D hW DKI t we may obtain a benefit in behalf of a person in his absence89 The following case must also be mentioned for here the principle seems to be accepted to the fullest extent If Reuben purchases a piece of land from Simeon in behalf of Levi whose agent he claims to be and the deed is written in Levis name Reuben cannot afterward say I purchased it for myself and want you to write another deed in my name90 The rabbis it is true base their ruling upon the theory that the seller ought not to be troubled to write an extra deed but I believe that the 88 Cf Ibid 89 Isserles to Hosh Mish 122 1 90 Maim 1 c II 5 Tur and Sh Ar ibid 184 3 141THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW underlying principle is after all the desire to benefit a person in whose behalf another undertook to act And Isserles in his gloss to this passage expressly says Even though Levi never authorized or appointed Reuben to purchase the land for him if Reuben did purchase the land in Levis name and paid for it with money that belonged to Levi then the sale cannot be rescinded9l Were it not for this ex tra stipulation which the glossator requiredviz that the money should belong to the principal in whose behalf the act was donethis statement would coincide in every par ticular with the modern doctrine That the rabbis accepted the principle of Ratification can be seen also from their statement of the reason for the law that if one finds an article in the street and takes possession of it in the name of another it immediately belongs to the one in whose name and in whose behalf possession was taken There the rabbis give as their reason that ninriy yDn irtr when he takes possession in behalf of the other he makes himself an agent for him and the law of possession that is applied here is the law that applies to agency92 A case where the principle of ratification is fully recognized is the following Where B who is not appointed agent learns from a hint that A would like to marry C and B performs the Kid dushin in behalf of A C then becomes lawfully the wife of A93 The theory of ratification is also recognized by the Talmud in the case when one voluntarily takes possession of goods from a debtor in behalf of a creditor though he was not requested by the creditor to do so  oyn7 DD1ir i1p 2in The rabbis allow such action where there is only one creditor but refuse to sanction it where there are a number of creditors not because they dispute the prin ciple of ratification but because of public policy the injury 91 Ibid 92 Cf Tosfaot B Mesia lOb 93 Sh Aruk Eben haEzer 35 4 cf above note 69 142THE JEWISH LAW OF AGENCYLEVINTHAL that will thus accrue to the others94 The clearest case and the most direct reference for Ratification is the follow ing cited in the Shulhan Aruk Where A sells real or personal property and B purchases and takes possession of the property or the article in behalf of CC being ignorant of the transactionit is in Cs power to ratify the sale or not If he ratifies it the article belongs to him if not the sale is nullified and the article belongs once more to A 95 There is however one important distinction between the theory of ratification as understood by the rabbis and as understood in the law today The latter applies the rule not only where it works to the benefit of the principal but also to his injury or disadvantage and thus permits him even to ratify the tort of an agent Jewish law clearly limits the theory to cases where it works to the principals ibenefit only the principle being 1w ra K n l r  Z3 m n 7 1 l we may benefit a person in his absence but cannot add a burden upon him96 Says the Beer ha Golah in commenting upon the above rule of law enunciated by R Isserles97 that if the court sees that the agency will not benefit the party in behalf of whom he acts then the agent will not be permitted to act for him Even in agency by appointment the principal can always say to his agent nmly5 til 1nnwW pn7 I have appointed you to benefit me not to injure me in this case where he has not even appointed him he could surely make this claim The Nimuke Yosef98 expressly states in speaking of a woman who desires to ratify the act of a man who with out her authority accepted in her behalf a bill of divorce 94 Gittin lib 95 Hosh Mish 235 23 cf 7l11n IN ibid The source of this law is in Maimonides Mekirah ch 30 The reading in the text ibid npli 1 nT1 is evidently incorrect cf Tur Hosh Mish 23525 nrN T1l3 IT1 trDlDn lD l plp DZt nD1Dr r1 rIt nD npl1Y In

husband that she cannot do so even though she wishes it because a divorce generally speaking does not come under the category of benefits to the principal CAN THE THIRD PERSON RECEDE BEFORE RATIFICATION Can the third person recede from the transaction after he finds out that the agent had no actual authority to act for his principal and the latter had not yet ratified the act This is a disputed point in modern law99 According to Jewish law it is clear that he could not for applying the rule of nirnrw DpD rrt acquiring possession in behalf of another in which it was said that the finder is regarded as an agent we know that the article belongs immediately to the party in whose behalf it was taken and not to the agent Hence by analogy if the agent does an act in behalf of another without being appointed by him immediately upon the performance of the act we apply the rule plr 1r1l MqV D31i we benefit a person in his absence and it is the same as if the principal had done it himself The above quoted case in the Talmud where one acts in behalf of a creditor also gives evidence of the fact that the third party deals not with the agent but with the principal even before the ratificationand therefore cannot recede from the transaction But we need not come to this con clusion by analogy alone The above quoted reference affirming the theory of ratification expressly states that m1r17yn y npli n the man for whom the purchase was made i e the principal has the upper hand If he wants to ratify the act the seller cannot recede from the trans action if he does not want to ratify the act he cannot be forced and the article goes back to the third partyIoo 99 In the United States the third person may recede before the ratification comp Tounsend v Corning

AGENCYLEVINTHAL 145 FORM OF APPOINTMENT a In Shelihut A Shalia or Sarsor a gratutious or paid agent may be appointed by oral communication alone The appoint ment does not need p1p Kinyan the special symbolical form of making an agreement binding nor does it have to be in writing or in the presence of witnessesIoI As Mai monides puts it witnesses can serve only where there is a conflict in testimony to enable us to know who speaks the truth or as the Talmud says102 quoting Rab Ashi wit nesses are created only for liars i e witnesses are not necessary to legalize the appointment of the agent but only as a guard against faithless persons who might deny the transaction o3 b In Harshaah The harshaah or power of attorney is always in writing and is given in a particular way It is accompanied by 1pp Kinyanl04 the special symbolical act of seizure by means of which the Mursheh becomes invested with all the power specifically defined in the instrument105 The HW1nn to W shetar harshaah or the written document must 101 Maim I 1 Hosh Mish 182 1 102 Kidd 65b 103 So also in Roman law no fixed form is necessary to constitute a mandatum and verbal appointment is sufficient D XVII I 1 2 cf G Leapingwell Manual of the Roman Civil Law 1859 p 212 In the modern EnglishAmerican law too oral authority is sufficient 104 Maim III 1 Hosh Mish 12 4 105 In case the claim for which the harshaah was given was for money kept by the third party there was a peculiar form of kinyan to mark the transfer of the claim As the law does not allow money to be transferred by the symbolical act the principal would hand over to the attorney a little earth and upon that the transfer of the claim was made Cf Maim III 7 B M 45b 46a B K 104b The Geonim however saw the hardships of this especially in the case where the principal possessed no land of his own They therefore ruled that in such a case the principal may trans fer the claim without using the earth applying the legal fiction that he conveys it upon four ells of the portion of earth that every Jew is supposed to possess in the Holy Land Maimonides was of the opinion that this legal fiction was resorted to so as more emphat ically to impress the defendant but where the third party refuses to recognize the Mursheh even where the P of ypip was made he cannot be compelled to do so and the plaintiff must make the demand himself Maim III 7 The Haggahot Mai muniyyot ibid quoting R Tam say that the partys mere declaration that he has ypnp is sufficient146 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW contain this formula Wh pNm ztl ri t proceed litigate acquire and possess for thyself106 or words to that effect If such words were not used the defendant was not obliged to answer the attorney or to recognize him and he could plead nK r Drn3 3y iN I have nothing to do with thee107 It must also conclude with the formula rm n y N l 1n  ynDT i I am respons ible for that which thou wilt expend for me in this suit108 This latter provision however is for the benefit of the principal or Marsheh as between him and the agent to show that the latter despite the formula litigate and pos sess for thyself cannot lay claim to what he acquires but remains an agent and must hand over the article to the principal If therefore this latter formula with reference to the expense is omitted from the document it remains valid and the third party can have no objection to it109 We see then that the formula go to law win and get for thyself does not actually transfer or assign the claim to the Mursheh but it is only a legal fiction used to give him the right to sue just as if the claim had actually been assigned An interesting case must here be noted A has a jewel in the possession of B and comes to B to claim it The latter answers that C came to him with a harshaah written by A making claim for it and he re turned it to C but C later loaned it back to him and that therefore he is responsible to C alone and is no longer responsible to A The law decided that B must return the jewel to A the rightful owner for C though he came with a harshaah was no more than As agent and had no legal right to loan it to anyone110 The rabbis however cling 106 B K 70a Maim Hosh Mish ibid 107 Maim and Hosh Mish ibid The Hosh Mish 122 7 rules that even if the word 11 litigate is omitted it is valid as long as it contains the concluding phrase to be noted later 108 Hosh Mish 122 6 Maim ibid words the formula as follows HXlnt iD 1D66 Y It I73 109 Hosh Mish 122 6 7 Maim III 1 11 Isserles to Hosh Mish 122 6 quoting Glosses of R MordecaiTHE JEWISH LAW OF AGENCYLEVINTHAL to this legal fiction to the fullest extent The document must show that the Mursheh will acquire for himself some part of the actual claim itself And so they decree that if the harshaah states that the Mursheh acquires a third or a fourth part of the claim for himself and not the entire claim even then the third party cannot say I have nothing to do with thee for a claim on a part gives you a right to make a claim on the whole111 But that is suf ficient as long as the Mursheh has a right to acquire for himself an actual part of the claim If however instead of a part in the claim the harshaah gives to the Mursheh a definite sum e g one hundred denars for his services even if this money is to be taken out of the money that is claimed it will not be a valid harshaah There must be an assigned legal claim to a definite part of the article claimed112 PARTIES TO THE RELATION Any person man or woman may be a principal or agent and even a married woman may be an agent The rule includes also the Canaanite bondman or bondwoman of a Jew for they are not regarded as Gentiles but come under the category of Bene berit113 There are however two important exceptions to this rule a One who is 11 Maim III 2 112 If the party himself has an actual claim in the article he naturally does not need a harshaah in order to bring suit So a partner or one of the heirs of an estate of which no partition has been made could sue without a harshaah their interests being joined each is authorized to act for the others Cf Maim III 3 note the differ ence however where one of the coheirs or copartners was absent from the city So also a husband cannot sue for property belonging to his wife alone without a har shaah from her If the controversy concerns those portions of his wifes property in which he has usufructuary rights he can sue without a harshaah Maim III 4 cf Gittin 48b 113 They are bound like women by all the negative commandments and by affirmative commandments not applying to stated times only While with reference to marriage they occupy a wholly different position from Israelites proper yet they are regarded as a subordinate part of the Jewish community They cannot however act as agents in marriage or divorce because the law of marriage and divorce does not apply to them 147148 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW deaf and dumb insane or a minorl14 cannot be either a principal or an agent5 b Neither can the oly one who is an idol worshipper serve in either capacity116 The exceptions to the rule17 a A minor can under no circumstances act as a principal nor can he appoint an agent even for those acts which he would be competent to do himself Thus a wife who is a minor cannot depute one to receive her bill of divorce though she may receive it herselfll8 On the other hand it must be remembered that while a minor or one non compos mentis is barred from being an agent yet for certain acts such as those that are purely ministerial or mechanical in their nature he may so act if both parties have previously agreed that he should Thus a minor may act as a messenger to carry money or goods for his principal to a third party or vice versa if the third party had previously given his consentll9 In discussing the capacity of the minor to act as agent the following interesting case is worth recording A father sends his minor son with a bottle and a coin of the value of a florin to buy a shillings worth of oil and also to bring back the change The shopkeeper gives the boy 114 The minor in Jewish law refers to a boy under 13 or a girl under 12 years of age 115 Maim II 1 Tur and Sh Ar 188 1 116 Ibid 117 In the modern law the question raised in this exception is a disputed one Whether an infant may be a principal earlier cases hold that action done by infants agent are void Tucker v Moreland 1 Am Lead Cas 247 note Later cases deny preferring the view of Chancellor Kent 2 Kent comm 235 that the tendency of the modern decisions is in favor of the reasonableness and policy of a very liberal extension of the rule that the acts and contracts of infants shall be deemed voidable only and subject to their election when they become of age either to affirm or to disavow them As to the principal who is non compos mentis there is also conflicting opinion All modern cases seem to agree that any person may as to the third person act as an agent Coke on Littleton 52a cf Huffcut p 34 unless perhaps one who is too young or too imbecile to perform at all the act in question cf Lyon v Kenl 45 Ala 656 So infants and even lunatics and other incompetents may be the channet of communication between a principal and one with whom he deals He himself however will incur none of the contractual liability attaching to an adult agent either to his principal or to the third person Jewish law certainly appears to be more logical in dealing with these cases 11s Gittin VI 3 Eben haEzer 141 2 3 119 Maim II 13 Hosh Mish 121 1THE JEWISH LAW OF AGENCYLEVINTHAL the oil and also the change from the florin On his way home the boy breaks the bottle and loses the change The rabbis decide that the shopkeeper is responsible for the loss of the oil and also for the change lost because he should have understood that the father sent the child only to notify the shopkeeper as to what he wants and it was the duty of the shopkeeper to have sent the oil with a respon sible person120 In other words the rabbis would deduce from this that a minor cannot act as an agent even for a purely ministerial act without having the express consent of the third party Here he did have the fathers implied consent but that was not sufficientl12 b As to the second exception viz the idol worship per the rule must be studied a little more closely in order to understand what the rabbis meant to decide First of all the above rule applying to the minor appointed to perform a minsterial act with the consent of the third party applies also to the Akum122 Secondly it is significant to note that the Talmud in laying down the qualifications for the parties to the relation of agency uses the expression that the party must be a Ben berit a son of the covenant23 and not the term Wno Israelite In fact an attempt was made to word the rule 5wN  aOrnv 9 N nIw  Dtn nrD just as you are Israelites so your agents must be Israelites but it did not succeed and the wording Bene berit remaineds24 We 120 B B 87b Maim II 2 121 R Judah ibid disagrees with this decision and holds that the fathers act in sending the boy with the bottle was a sufficient consent on his part The dispute is as to question of fact not of law As to the loss of the bottle itself both are agreed that the father is responsible because in giving the bottle to the child he wilfully ran the risk of its breaking In rabbinic language the bottle was nynF nrRout of his mind at the very moment he gave it to the child 122 Maim and Hosh Mish ibid 123 Kidd 41b R Yannai commenting upon the seemingly superfluous word D also in Numb 17 28 cf above p 137 says that from this word we derive the law that just as the principal must be a Ben berit so also must the agent be a Ben berit 124 Cf Gittin 23b 149THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW have also noticed that the Canaanite bondman was allowed to act as an agent even though he was not an Israelite because he came under the classification of Bene berits25 We may deduce from this that the exclusion of the mliy or heathen did not have the unanimous consent of the rabbis In fact we have the clearest proof that there was a very strong effort made to include the Akum among the eligibles for the agency relation It was reported in behalf of Rab Ashi that he limited the exclusion of the Akum from the rl6e of agent only in the case of lnrn perhaps because of its religious nature In all other cases the tradition has it he allowed the use of an Akum as agent Another tradition was reported to the effect that Rab Ashi prohibited them to act as agents for Israelites but did allow Israelites to act as agents for them The prevailing opinion however did not favor these traditions and curtly declared wi niinn the tradition is not a truthful oneI26 The rabbis whose opinion in this matter prevailed are not to be censured for their apparent exclusiveness There was a valid reasona religious reason it is true that prompted them to take this step The agent in Jewish law frequently is compelled to take an oath127 The oath played a most sacred r61e in the life of the people and there was no desire to force a nonJew to comply with the strictness of that act That this was the principal factor in swaying the rabbis in their decision barring theAkum from the r6le of agent I believe may be seen from the rabbis wording of the law prohibiting an Israelite from entering into a partnership relation with an Akum n11D lvtw 17 24nnr HNw r3z1 nirly my nlsnrw mwvyw D7 17t 212 n rMly yZtzml It is prohibited to join in part 125 Above p

this matter was relaxed permission being given to confer the power of attorney also upon the Akum129 There is in fact a distinct historical reference to a harshaah that was given to a non Jew by Rabbenu Tam and which was accompanied by the symbolical act of kinyanI3o AN ASSUMPTION WORTH NOTING A fact that well illustrates how far ethical and religious principles were interwoven with purely legal discussion is the statement made by the Talmud that we assume that a son will not delegate his father to serve him in a ministerial or operative act the feeling prompting this assumption being that such a request would be disrespectful to parentsI3 This rule however would not apply to his appointment as agent in business transactions ELIGIBILITY OF AGENT DETERMINED AT TIME OF APPOINTMENT A person may not be appointed as agent if he is not eligible at the time of the appointment even though he would become eligible at the time the act of agency was to be executed Thus if a man appointed a minor or one non compos mentis to deliver a bill of divorce to his wife 128 Sanhedrin 63b ct Tur Hosh Mish 181 1 We must also bear in mind that the status of agency undoubtedly had its origin in religious at least in sacred relationship as may be seen from the talmudic interpretation of the biblical authority for the agency relation cf above p 135 We can therefore understand that the nonJew could not possibly be included Indeed for the same reason the Jew could not serve as an agent for an Akum principal 129 Hosh Mish 123 14 A slight changing in the wording of the document was however necessary Instead of the phrase 1P2 Kl3lpl only 1DDY 13pl was to be written 130 Tosafot Kidd 3a Tur ibid 123 15 131 Cf Kidd 45b rPv 1i 11 riiV V Yn I t the aversion was more to asking the father to act than in having him act The reference quoted shows that a son may hint to his father that he would like to have a certain act performed Cf also the striking citation by R Jacob Emden of Judges 143 Emden to Kidd ibid 151THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW then even though at the time the divorce was delivered the minor became of age or the imbecile became of sound mind the delivery was invalid and the divorce could not take effectl32 If however the agent was qualified at the time of appointment but afterward became incapacitated and at the time of the performance of the act again became qualified the appointment was valid Thus if in the above case the bill of divorce was delivered to the agent when he was of sound mind and later he became non compos mentis if at the time he delivered the divorce to his prin cipals wife he was again sound then the appointment and the delivery are both valid because as the rabbis point out nrmi 1iDDi innn the beginning i e the appointment and the conclusion i e the performance were in time of eligibility 33 JOINT PRINCIPALS As in the modern lawI34 so also in the Jewish law two or more persons may jointly be the principals of an agent Maimonides gives us the following illustration Three men appointed Reuben as agent and each gave him money to purchase a certain article Reuben spent only a part of the money given to him The article will nevertheless belong jointly to the three who appointed him even though it was Reubens intention to purchase the article for only one of the principalsI35 This decision is based upon the principle that the money that was given to him was given jointly and was mixed together it was therefore impossible 132 Sh Ar Eben haEzer 141 32 133 Ibid 134 Cf Perminter v Kelley 18 Ala 716 135 Maim Hilkot Mekirah VII 13 14 Cf B Mesia 74a The RaMA adds that this decision will be the same even if the agent had expressly said to the seller that he was purchasing the article for only one of the principals cf Tur ibid 184 1 R Isaiah quoted by the Tur ibid however carrying the doctrine of renunciation to an extreme says that if the agent before the purchase expressly says that he is going to purchase the article for one of the parties alone the purchase will belong to him because this statement implies that he renounces his agency for the others R Isaiahs view however is an isolated one and is not accepted as the general law 152THE JEWISH LAW OF AGENCYLEVINTHAL for the agent to take part of this mixed sum and with it to serve only one of his principals If however each of the principals gave him his money separately the money being separately wrapped or sealed and distinctly marked in that case if he purchased the article using only part of the money the article will belong to the party whose money was used as the purchase price even though he had intended that the article should belong to allI36 The difference in the two cases is a difference in factin the first the prin cipals were joined and therefore he could not serve one at the expense of the others in the second case the appoint ment was joint and several and he therefore could serve only one of the parties The pupils of the Rashba R Solomon ben Abraham ibn Adret discussing the rule as laid down by Maimonides give us this clearer illustration of joint principalship If the three principals gave the mo ney in the presence of each other then it is as if the moneys were mixed together and the agent must serve all of them or none They are then like partners and the agent cannot renounce part of his agency If however each of the principals gave the money separately not in each others presence then it is a joint and several agency and he is at liberty to serve one and renounce the agency of the others137 JOINT AGENTS Just as there may be joint principals so too there may be joint agents i e two or more persons may be appointed by the principal to perform the same act When the agents are joint the execution of the agency must be jointI38 Whether in a particular case the agency is joint or several is a question of fact and will depend upon the 136 Ibid 137 Cf Bet Yosef to Tur 184 1 138 Cf Isserles to Hosh Mish 122 3 so also in English law cf Commonwealth v Canal Commissioners 9 Watts Pa 466 153THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW circumstances surrounding the appointment Thus if a man while in a dangerous condition says to a group of men standing by Take for me a bill of divorce to my wife then anyone of the men may act as agent for himI39 If how ever he said to the group lmnlin QD All of you take for me the divorce to my wife then the act must be done jointly by all the people in that groupI40 The former is a case where the agency is several the latter an example of joint agency alone DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY Can the agent appoint a subagent to perform the act for which he was originally appointed and thus make the principal responsible for the subagents action There is some confusion in the rabbinic decisions as to the answer but on closer examination we shall see that they agree with the view accepted by the English Common Law4 We noted aboveI42 that from the double use of the word nn1JI43 the rabbis deduce the law that an agent may ap point a subagent But this inference must not be under stood to apply in all cases What the rabbis there meant to imply was that this law may be deduced to apply in some special cases in other words that this was to be the exception to the general rule viz that unless the principal gave his sanction an agent may not entrust the perfor mance of his duties to another The very case that the rabbis were there considering was exceptional it was the case of divorce and there they say a mans agent 33 Shul Ar Eben haEzer 141 21 140 Ibid 141 23 141 The general rule is Delegatus non potest delegare Exceptions to this rule are to be found when the principal grants the power or where there is an implied power to delegate the authority Also where the acts are merely mechanical clerical or ministerial involving no judgment or discretion Cullinan v Bowker 180 N Y 93 72 N E 911 Lyon v Jerome 26 Wend 485 37 Am Dec 271 142 Above p 136 cf Kidd 41a 143 In Deut 24 3 154THE JEWISH LAW OF AGENCYLEVINTHAL could appoint a subagent because it is a case of nrnn y where the wifes consent is not required She is in fact not a third party to deal with at all as she is not asked whether she desires to receive it or not In other words the act on behalf of the agent is purely ministerial and as in modern law where the act to be performed is only minis terial the authority to execute it may be delegated Even where the act is purely ministerial where the principal expressly states that the agent himself is to perform the action the power cannot be delegated Thus where the husband says to the agent 1iln rnn You deliver itI44 he must do the act himself unless an accident overtakes him on the way or he becomes seriously ill when the authority may be delegatedI45 If however he expressly commands him not to permit any one else to do the act he cannot delegate even in the case of accident or sick ness 46 Where the agent on the other hand is required to exercise discretion judgment or skill or where it may be seen that the agents appointment is due to the confidence that the principal reposes in him he cannot delegate the performance of his duties without the consent of the principal Thus it is the prevailing opinion that an agent appointed to give Kiddushin to a certain woman in behalf of his principal cannot appoint a sub agent to do it for himI47 So also where the principal has appointed one to hold an article for him the agent cannot appoint a sub agent without the principals permissions48 because of the confidential character of the relation The principal may say inn r n n nps P nn rinx 1p I trusted you but I 144 According to some authorities even if he said 171 Deliver he must do it himself 145 Eben haEzer 141 38 146 Cf Isserles ibid 147 Isserles quoting Glosses of R Mordecai Eben haEzer 36 5 ibid 36 5 cf note 69 148 Tur Hilkot Pikkadon 291 24 155THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW would not trust another It is for the same reason that the law holds that a Mursheh cannot delegate his power of attorney to anotherI49 As the harshaah is almost al ways given to sue for a definite article the principal can say also here It was my desire that you take it but I did not want anyone else to lay hands upon it The rabbis give us the explanation of this divergence in ruling because 1in3 D they are wordsso0 and there is an express ruling in the Talmud nlv r pDD 1 D an agent may delegate an act to a subagent but he may not delegate words that are to be spoken or consent that is to be given or asked Is5which is but another form of the way modern law makes the distinction Thus B appointed by A to give Kiddushin to C cannot delegate his authority to D because his act depends upon the consent of the third party If on the other hand B is appointed to give a get bill of divorce to C in behalf of A he may delegate this act to D because the act which is purely ministerial consists in transmitting through another a tangible object and does not require any words to be spoken nor consent to be asked So too the wifes agent appointed to receive the get cannot appoint a subagent because the action depends first of all upon the consent or will of the hus bands52 and secondly because that which he imparted to the agent was only words The subagent where the authority to appoint one is given is in the same legal status as the first agent and can of course not appoint a second subagent without the con sent of the principal1s3 149 Maim ibid III 8 Hosh Mish 123 4 He can of course if he gets the express consent of the Marsheh 150 Cf Sh Ar Eben haEzer 36 5 151 Gitrin 29a 152 Cf Bet Shemuel to Eben haEzer 35 6 for a difference in interpreting the word 1D by the DID Mordecai and 1X1D

rw inib Inm1 DIM A mans agent is like unto himself may be thus statedthat an agent may be appointed to do every thing that a principal could do himself s4 This rule goes further in its application than does the modern English law The latter does not apply the rule to certain acts which because of their nature or because of a matter of policy are required to be performed by the person himself Thus for instance the law does not tol erate the substitution of an agent or representative to perform the rite of marriage55s In the Jewish law agency does apply to marriage and in fact it is safe to presume that the whole law of agency developed from the law of marriage and divorceis6 Not only could the man marry by proxy but the woman too could appoint an agent to represent her in the marriage ceremonyI57 While this practice of marrying by proxy was quite common to the whole of medieval Europe158 it is very seldom practised today There is however an interesting American record of such a marriage worth relating The Rev Joseph Jessurun Pinto who was Minister of the Congregation Shearith Israel of New York in the Revolutionary Days fell in love with Rebekah the daughter of Moses de la Torre of London Before she came to New York he sent a commission to Dayyan de Crasto of London to give Kiddushin to Miss de la Torre for him She was thus married to him in London while he remained in New 164 See above p 148 where a minor cannot appoint an agent even for that which the minor can do himself 155 Cf Mechems Agency par 126 Exception was at times made in the case of princes ibid 156

marriage rite so too does agency apply in divorce A man may appoint an agent to deliver the get to his wife and the wife may appoint an agent to accept the get in her behalfI6I All the laws that apply to the principals in the case of divorce apply with equal force to the agentsi62 The prevailing opinion here too is that the wife cannot appoint an agent to receive the get from an agent of the husbandI63 LIMITATION TO GENERAL RULE The general rule stated above calls for one limitation and one important exception The limitation to the rule is as follows Whether a certain act can be performed by an agent will depend upon the validity of the act at the time of appointment and not at the time of performance A man cannot appoint an agent to do that which he could not do himself at the time of the appointment of the agent although he might have been able to do it afterwards Thus A appoints B as agent to marry for him C wlom he believes to be divorced C however is not divorced at the time of Bs appointment but is divorced at the time when B reaches her B cannot 159 Cf Items Relating to the History of the Jews of New York by N T Phillips in Amer Jewish Historical Society Vol XI p 153 I am

mnnn Nnwr7 rylr Nn ri H9K nLb w Mw1V V Im K nWm nv s inwn n iTny A man can only be appointed to do an act which may be performed at the time of ap pointment i64 EXCEPTION TO GENERAL RULE ILLEGALITY OF ACT The one important exception to the above rule is that the appointment of agency must not contemplate an il legal object Accordingly an act which if done by the principal would be illegal cannot be done through the agency of another and such appointment is consequently void Modern law too recognizes this principle There can be no such thing as agency in the perpetration of a crime but all persons actively participating are principals  65 The Talmud expresses it nlmy n3 nint 1pN There can be no agency for wrongful acts i e he who commits a wrongful act under the direction of his principal is himself responsible for it The reason for this rule is that the authority of the principal cannot justify an act prohibited by the divine authority of the law or as the rabbis ex pressed it 1Dri   nr 7 nn in r in in n If the Masters Gods words conflict with the pupils the prin cipals words to whom should you give heedI66 Thus in all cases where the act done is illegal the doer of the act is alone responsible and the man who ap 164 Nazir 12b rID TIDI Tur ibid 182 1 166 Pierce v Toote 113 Ill 228 Leonard v Poole 114 N Y 371 He who exe cutes the criminal act is particeps criminis with the principal who directs it cf Mechems Agency  121 So also in Roman law Rei turpis nullum est mandatum D XVII 1 6 3 Inst III 26 par 7 13 166 Kidd 42b The Talmud also builds up this rule by emphasizing the demon strative pronoun llW1 that in Leviticus 174 lIlT Vt1 rr  I it shall be reck oned sin to that man only 159THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW pointed him or authorized him to do it bears no responsi bility While this is the accepted law the Talmud shows that there was a strong opposing view held by Shammai the Elder who did not admit this exception to the general rule but held that when a man directed a crime the prin cipal should bear the responsibility for his agents act quoting as support for his contention the words spoken by the Prophet Nathan to King David liy 3 anna nnni inml Him hast thou slain with the sword of the children of Ammon167 although it was not David himself who killed Uriah but his representative Joab who carried out Davids instruction But even Shammai adds a limitation to his view viz he would hold the principal liable only in the case where the agent derives no personal enjoyment from the act Shammai too holds that a sinful act the nature of which consists in the enjoyment derived therefrom cannot be imputed to the principal and the doer of the act8 himself must bear the responsibility Thus an example of a purely religious act is given If A said to B Go and eat forbidden food A is not held responsiblethe principle being nnon t rmm rit r n r rninn 5 1irxD t we do not find in the Torah any case where one can enjoy the fruits of the act and the other is to bear the responsibilityi6 We must note here the very inclusive nature of the word iinnmy transgression or wrongful act It includes all acts that are sinful i e opposed to the laws of the Jewish religion and also all acts that are criminal in their nature Whether the act done by the agent was to marry a divorced woman for the principal who happened to be a priest69 or whether the act done was to kill a human being at the 167 II Sam 12 9 cf Kidd 43a See S Zeitlin The Semicha Controversy Be tween the Zugoth Jew Quart Rev New Series VII p 510 for an ingenious sug gestion that

160THE JEWISH LAW OF AGENCYLEVINTHAL request of another70o makes no difference in the applica tion of the law Both come under the category of naly wrongful or illegal acts and there is no responsibility on the part of the principalI7I The rule rr3y imnn n9 1 goes even further than that It applies also to torts or civil wrongs which arise from negligence or carelessness of an agent or servant in the performance of his duty172 While this is contrary to our modern English practice and may seem somewhat harsh in its rulings it must be said in its favor that it is logical and carries out the purposes for which agency has has been establishedI73 It inust here be noted that many modern jurists of note admit that the English rule re spondeat superior is illogical and contrary to reason Thus Sir William Anson in his work on Contracts says It would be interesting to inquire how far the doctrine of representation in such cases is of modern origin It may be that the extreme form which Employers Liability has assumed in English law is an application to modern society of rules which are properly applicable when the master is served by slaves and is liable for injuries done by them as being part of his propertyI74 So also do others while attempting to find out the basis of the prin cipals liability in all such actions admit that the ruling is altogether opposed to reason and as one writer says 169 Cf ibid 42b 170 Cf ibid 43a 171 So when one injures or kills another in compliance with the latters own request or command the criminal will be found guilty even without malicious premeditation Cf B K 92a 172 Cf Tur Hosh Mish 396 7 This is contrary to the later Roman and to the modern English law The Roman law in later stages holds the principal respon sible with respect to carelessness or negligence of agent or servant in the course of his duty applying the maxim Respondeat superior let the principal be held respon sible 4 Inst 114 cf Pollock on Torts 5th ed

161THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW shows a conflict between law and common sense175 The doctrine of today he continues took shape under Lord Holt in a conscious effort to adjust the rule of law to the expediency of mercantile affairs His reasons are in substance covered by his brief sentence in Waylands Case It is more reasonable that he should suffer for the cheats of his servants than strangers and tradesmen I76 The Jewish law clings tenaciously to the logical outcome of its rulings and refuses to yield to expediency For that reason even in the extreme case where A appoints B to dig a pit in a public path and C is thereby injured the principle Irl3y ln7 Mnp 1 is applied and B primarily is held responsible 77 In discussing the legality of the act in agency it is also interesting to note in passing a difference of opinion between the Jewish and the modern law with reference to the Shadkan or marriage broker The English law regards such marriage brokerage as opposed to public policy and therefore the appointment of one is held to be void even though in the given case no fraud was practised on either party78 The Jewish law included the Shadkan in the class of lawful agents79 and indeed he played a most important r6le in the life of the people especially in the middle ages down to almost recent timesi8o EXCEPTIONS TO THE EXCEPTION There are however certain cases where the rule 1 n3y na1 nrp does not apply Thus Rabina limits 17 Cf J H Wigmore History of Tortious Responsibility in Select Essays in AngloAmer Legal Hist Vol III p 529f 176 Waylands case 3 Salk 234 quoted by

Hosh Mish 292 9 quoted by Trn n 192 N DtD evidently agreeing with Lord Holts contention that in such case where the agent could not make good it is more reasonable that the principal should suffer than the innocent stranger 177 Cf B K 51a Hosh Mish 410 8 See also ibid 348 8 note of Isserles 178 Crawford v Russel 62 Barb N Y 92 179 Cf Isserles to Iosh Mish 185 10 also 0t3 ad loc 180 Cf Abrahams Jewish Life in Middle Ages p 173 162THE JEWISH LAW OF AGENCYLEVINTHAL 163 the application of this rule only where the representative is a tian m1 a responsible partyI8I Rab Sama on the other hand limits the rule to cases y 1 y Y w y K rny where the agent can use his free will either to do or not to do the act Where the agent is compelled to do the act even against his will the rule will not apply and the principal instead of the agent will be held liableI82 Exam ining both of these theories we must come to the conclusion that Rab Samas is far more logical and is by far the better statement of the law Indeed the Rosh quoting R Meir haLevi says that the statement of the law which we ac cept is the one given by R Sama and gives as proof a corrected reading of the text to wit that Rab Sama presented his view in the presence of Rabina in the name of R Iwya and we have no record of a denial of this state ment by Rabina The silence on the part of Rabina is regarded by the commentator as an admission that Rab Samas is a true statement of the lawI83 Rabinas view could apply only in the performance of religious acts184 Samas 181 B M lOb It is quite difficult to give a proper English equivalent to this Hebrew expression as used in this connection In applying it to religious acts it would mean one who is obligated either to perform or to abstain from these acts Applying it to civil or criminal acts the meaning is not clear at all It cannot refer to one who is not responsible legally e g a minor or non compos mentis as the rules of agency do not apply there The only exampleother than those of a purely religious signifi cancegiven by Rabina is the case where the stolen article is found in the courtyard belonging to the thief and it is regarded as if found in the hands of the thief because the court is viewed as the thiefs agent The court is of course not respon sible for acts done therein 182 Ibid In both these views the underlying thought is that it cannot here be said lyDI1 2j 13T 2t n L13 1n e11 1 T that he was to obey the Masters words and not the words of his principalin the former the masters words did not apply to him in the latter hewas

nonresponsibility but without success Cf B Mesia 10b  1331 IYX l3yl n1t i qDlK1 in which a married woman and a slave are offered as examples of Rlrn 3 1K1  but where the answer is given that legally speaking the ilrK and y though in their present status unable to pay damages are neverthe less regarded as bClln 3 responsible with payment deferred until slave is emancipated or woman freed of marital tie R Akiba Eger commenting upon this suggested case of the Talmud offers a better and more striking answer viz that the reason we say one is not a 3lln 3 is because the principle DnIn1 13n 311 131 does not apply to him But here the Yy and 7t1 must also pay heed to the words of the Master for they too are prohibited to steal hence they are tKl1n 3 responsible But this164 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW interpretation applies to all cases of the law I85 A logical corollary to be deduced from the above statement of the law is the further exception to the general rule that where the Shaliah did not know the act was an nrry or wrongful where for example the undertaking was lawful on its face and the agent was ignorant of the facts or the purpose which alone rendered it unlawfulthe act does not become affected by its illegality and the status of agency remains establishedI86 Thus suppose a thief came to an innocent party and asked him as a favor to re move an ox from a certain barn which he claimed belonged to him and to watch it for him The ox was in fact not his but belonged to another The man complied with the thiefs request and after he removed the ox it died The Talmud rules that from the moment the agent removed the ox it was the act of the principal and the thief alone was therefore responsibleI87 The agent believing that the ox belonged to his principal and therefore that he had a legal right to remove him is not affected by the actual illegality of the act because the principle of the masters command conflicting with his principals does not apply comment while striking is unnecessary as the Talmud itself ibid shows that they are responsible else why should they pay afterwards 185 The Talmuds effort to prove that there is a practical difference in the appli cation of these two rules B Mesia lOb seems to me to be farfetched As to the question of the Xn both rules would equally applythe Inl is not a Kl3n 1 but it is also not able to express its own will hence it is not in the category of 13y Y l Try 7 Ry  Sil Even in the cases givenof a religious nature where the Talmud does make out a case of difference in applicationit can be seen that the Talmud stretches the terms used to an unwarranted degree Thus where the Kohen asks an Israelite to marry for him a divorced woman the Talmud says that the agent here is l1ln n 13 but does possess freedom to choose whether to do the act or not Hence says the Talmud according to Rabina the Kohen or principal would be responsible According to Rab Sama the agent alone would be responsible But to say that the agent is not a 1rn 1 simply because the particular law of marriage does not apply to him personally but only to the priest is begging the question It would be far more logical to say that he being the Kohens representative acting for the priest is legally a Kltll 1 and hence he should be responsible Perhaps this is what the Rosh ibid meant when he said in conclusion mn3I iw3 13ry r12t9 nnrt 1jr Cf also Tosafot B Kam 79a bot for a similar forced interpretation 186 Hosh Mish 182 1 1nal 1lt ad loc So also in modern law Cf Roys v Johnson 7 Gray Mass 162 187 Cf Tosafot to B Mesia lOb cf also 31 1N to Hosh Mish 348 10THE JEWISH LAW OF AGENCYLEVINTHAL FURTHER EXCEPTIONSPARTICULAR CASES In addition to the general rules enunciated by Rabina and Rab Sama limiting the application of the law with reference to the illegality of the action the Talmud also enumerates a few special cases not at all in the class of Rabinas and Rab Samas exceptions which are never theless not affected by the rule nnry nir nrp1 1 There is first the case of niyn or the inadvertent conversion of Temple property to profane use There if an agent com mitted the act in behalf of his principal the latter is held responsible despite the fact that the act was illegal The Talmud there points out that this exception is based upon the use of rW ritl a similarity of phrase in two verses of the BibleI88 The fact of the matter is that the case of Meilah presents no further exception but is another ex ample of the case just discussed where the agent does not know that the act is prohibited The very act of Meilah implies not knowing that it is sacredI8s Another exception to the ruleIso is the case where an animal that was stolen was sold or slaughtered by the thiefs representative There the rabbis decide that the thief must pay the penalty of rmn nmy xN four or five times its value and not the agent despite the fact that the act of the agent was illegalIsI But here again the rabbis do not rest their case upon legal principle but upon an analogy between the two cases embodied in the words 1 nIMDl 1ln3 and he kills it or sells itI92 Just as in selling two parties are necessarily implied the seller and the purchaser so too say the rabbis in the case of slaughtering two 188 Kidd 42b The reference is to the similar use of Ktn in Lev 5 15 and Num 17 32 189 Cf Tosafot Kidd 42b bot 190 Simmons cf note 83 mentions only the 1BD case and says that is the one exception He evidently overlooked this and the following case 191 B Kam 79a cf ibid 71a Tur Hosh Mish 350 4 192 Exod 21 37 165THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW parties the principal and his representative may be im plied Mention must also be made of the case taught by the school of Hillel that where a man was entrusted with the keeping of an article and he authorized another to convert it or to misappropriate it the principal would be held liable193 though the illegal act was actually committed by the agent But here again they make use of a special verse in the ScripturesI94 to permit this exception Lastly must be mentioned the very interesting case cited by Isserles in his glossatory comments to the Shulhan Aruk that where a man delegates another to act as informer against a certain person if the man thus delegated had the reputation of being an informer then the principal in this case i e the man who thus instigated the informer to do his work will be held guilty But here again the exception is not really an exception to the general rule For as one of the rabbis well notes as soon as the principal gave the information to the professional informer he already was guilty of a crime because having told it to a reputed in former he should have foreseen the consequence of his act i95 TERMINATION OF THE RELATION WHEN PURPOSE OF AGENCY IS ACCOMPLISHED The relation of agency is terminated as soon as the act for which the agent has been appointed has been performed As to what constitutes performance will of course be a question of fact and will depend upon the nature of the transaction usage and custom Thus the 193 B Mesia 44a Kidd 42b Tur Hosh Mish 292 7 194 Exod 22 8 the words y ID 132 yp It is interesting to note that the SEID commentary to the Tur by R Joshua Falk Kohen ibid 297 7 does not accept this ruling and says that Beth Hillel must have meant it to apply only in a case where the agent did not know that the article did not belong to the principal 195 Isserles to Hosh Mish 388 15 Cf nltn Inni ibid quoting the Hatam Sofer 166THE JEWISH LAW OF AGENCYLEVINTHAL case of the Shadkan presents an interesting illustration Whether he will be entitled to his fee or brokerage as soon as the parties agreed to marry or only when the marriage actually takes place will depend upon the custom in vogue in the particular localityI96 Where there is no particular custom the time when the marriage takes place is when the relationship is terminated Where the custom is to wait until the wedding day or where no custom at all prevails the Shadkan has no claim where the parties afterward re ceded from their compactI97 The case of divorce gives us another good illustration If the principal appoints an agent to deliver a bill of divorce to his wife she is not divorced until the agent actually delivered it to her Until then the principal may revoke and the agent may renounce his power08 In the case where the wife appoints the agent to receive the get just as soon as the agent receives it in his hands the divorce takes effect and the relationship terminates thenI99 She can no longer revoke and he can no longer renounce his authority Where however she appoints the agent to accept the get and to deliver it to her the divorce becomes effective only when it is delivered to her and the relation ship is not terminated before200 Until she receives it her self she may revoke the power of the agent REVOCATION BY PRINCIPAL The principal has the power to revoke his agents authority at any time with or without a good excuse and 196 Isserles to Hosh Mish 185 10 197 Idemunless previously agreed otherwise As was stated above custom differed in this matter thus Isserlein Dnrl1 DpDD 85 says When the match is made the Shadkans work is done and his wages earned But in our place we are not wont to pay the Shadkans fee till the marriage is celebrated Elsewhere they pay immediately the contract is drawn up Dpn3 Cl1ln 198 Eben haEzer 140 1 Cf Gittin IV 1 199 Ibid 140 3 200 Ibid 140 5 167THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW whatever the agent does after revocation is not binding upon the principal This applies to the case where a power of attorney has been conferred as well as in ordinary agency201 While he has the power to revoke he must see to it that the revocation is brought home either to the agent202 or to the person with whom he deals otherwise he will be responsible for his representatives dealings203 It follows then that where the principal appoints a second agent to do the act for which the first agent was appointed he thereby revokes the authority of the first Thus where A gave to B a power of attorney and later gave another harshaah to C both B and C appear before D with the claim The law says that D must recognize C the second appointee because the latter appointment implies the revocation of the first204 This power of revocation is given to the principal on the theory that inasmuch as the relationship is of a con fidential nature he has the power to select whomsoever he pleases and to terminate his authority whenever he so pleases Where the agent is a gratuitous one and therefore suffers no loss because of the revocation the principle holds good But what of the Sarsor Suppose he has already undertaken the performnce of the transaction can his authority to continue in that case also be revoked The law does not gives us an answer to this question It seems to me however that we may infer what the rulings of the rabbis would be from the very similar case of ylv day laborers Either party there has a right to withdraw from the transaction But it is clear from the statement of the law that they have this right only before the laborer com 201 Maim III 8 Hosh Mish 122 3 So also in Roman law cf G Leaping well idem p 248 and in modern English law cf Hartleys Appeal 53 Pa St 212 Burke v Priest 50 Mo App 310 Conley v Dazian 114 N Y 161 202 Isserles to Hosh Mish 122 3 end 203 See above p 138 cf Maim III 10 Hosh Mish 122 2 204 Hosh Mish 123 3 cf for a similar ruling Copeland v Mercantile Ins Co 6 pick Mass 198 168THE JEWISH LAW OF AGENCYLEVINTHAL menced his work because neither would then suffer any loss If he already commenced his labors then the master canndt discharge him unless he pays him as in the case of an idle laborer n yJO205 Applying the same rule we would say that the principal can revoke at all times even in the case of the Sarsor But where the Sarsor would by the revocation suffer a loss the principal would be made to pay him the amount of his loss206 EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE OF REVOCATION An important exception to the general rule permitting the principal to revoke the authority of his agent must here be noted When the principal hands to his agent a deed of gift as for instance a deed of manumission for delivery to his bondman the principal cannot revoke his representatives authority and the deed cannot be recal led207 The exception here is based solely upon the passion for justice which is noticeable in all the rabbinical decisions The sages base their ruling upon the principles previously discussed rz mrw aNw lpr that we benefit a person also in his absence Once the master delivered the deed grant ing liberty to his bondman the latter is entitled to the be nefit he had intended to confer upon him There is a further exception to the general rule based upon the principle above quoted that we benefit a person in his absence If Reuben owed Simeon money or held in his possession a treasure belonging to Simeon and delivering this money or article to Levi his representative 205 Tur Hosh Mish 333 1 2 Cf B Mesia 31b for explanation of term 71it Pyl1 the pay which a laborer would ask for stopping work for which he was engaged which would be less than he would earn by working Another opinion explains it as much as a laborer out of work would take rather than be idle 206 So too in modern law While the principal has the power he has not always the right to revoke and agent has action against the principal for any damages caused thereby BrushSwan Electric Light Co v Brush Electric Co 41 Fed 163 While he can sue for damages the courts will not specifically enforce the contract against the principal Elwell v Coon 46 Atl 580 207 Gittin I 5 169THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW said Take this to Simeon to whom it belongs he can no longer revoke Levis authority nor recall the delivered article Once it came to Levis hands it was accepted in behalf of Simeon208 The peculiarity of this decision is further complicated by the ruling that despite the fact that the principal can no longer recall his agents power he nevertheless remains responsible for its safe delivery into the hands of Simeon209 This ruling presented by Rab was accepted as law but Samuel disputes it and holds that the principal remains responsible and may also recall the power of the agent until the article is actually delivered to the third party Samuels view certainly is more logical and it is evident that the later authorities while accepting Rabs decision did not favor it and limited its application only to the case 1n Tp3n prmnllo when the principal was not an honorable person2Io the suspicion being enter tained that his attempt to recall the agent was prompted RENUNCIATION BY AGENT Just like the principal the agent too has the power to renounce his agency at any time and the principal can have no legal claim against him2II BY CHANGE IN CONDITION OF PARTIES Agency is likewise terminated if there is a change in the condition of the parties Death of either party puts an end immediately to the relation212 No act of the agent after the principal dies can bind the heirs of the principal nor can the heirs benefit by his acts unless they adopt him as their agent3 Although as we have seen before2I4 208 Gittin 14a Hosh Mish 125 1 This applies only to cases of debt or bail ment not in the case of gifts Hosh Mish 125 5 209 Hosh Mish 125 1 210 Gitin 14a Hosh Mish 125 2 211 Tur Hosh Mish 183 1 Cf Barrow v Cushway 37 Mich 481 for a similar ruling where the agency is for an indefinite period or is an agency at will 212 Eben haEzer 141 41 213 Git I 6 ibid 13a f 214 Above p 168 and p 138 170THE JEWISH LAW OF AGENCYLEVINTHAL by his desire to defraud the rightful owner of the article notice of the revocation of an agency is generally necessary yet when it is revoked by death the revocation takes effect at once even as to persons ignorant of the principals death215 It is for that reason that the codifiers advise a third party in dealing with an agent not to give up an article belonging to the principal unless the agent bears a harsahah Without this power of attorney if when he gave up the article to the agent the principal was dead and the agent lost it or met an accident on the way that prevented his returning it the third party would be liable to the principals heirs for the reason that the moment the principal died the agency terminated and the third party gave up the article at his own risk2I6 Where the agent on the other hand bears an harshaah his power does not lapse by the death of the principal as he is in legal effect at least an assignee of the claim and acts in his own right It is for that reason too that the third party must always recognize the Mursheh and cannot say to him I fear to recognize you lest your authority has been revoked2I7 Once he displays the harshaah he has a legal claim and unless the third party has absolute knowledge of his re vocation he must deal with him218 The subsequent occurrence of imbecility or deafness and dumbness of the agent or principal will also terminate 215 For a similar ruling in English Common Law cf Farmers L  T Co v Wilson 139 N Y 284 In the Roman law if the mandatory while ignorant of the death of the principal does act bona fide within his authority the heirs of the principal are to be bound by what is so done Inst III 26 9 11 Dig XVII So also while death of either party ordinarily revokes where it appears that the transaction at the time of the death was in such a state that there could not be a revocation the liabilities will devolve upon the heirs D XVII 1 2 6 idem XXVII 3 216 Hosh Mish 122 1 217 While death does not automatically revoke in the case where one has a har shaah it is nevertheless possible for the heirs of the dead principal to revoke the agency Hence Nhere the third party is apprised of the death of the principal he is advised not to recognize the Mursheh for he can fear that the heirs have revoked the agency cf l I l ibid quoting the n17 and the nt71D 218 Maim III 10 Hosh Mish 122 3 171THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW the relation29I The same reason that operates to sus pend an agency during ineligibility affects its revival upon the restoration to eligibility220 WHERE THE PARTIES ARE JOINT We have already seen that where the principals are joint the agent while he can renounce his agency with respect to all cannot renounce with respect to part of his principals221 So too where the agents are joint it is to be presumed that the principal desires their joint action and judgment And indeed there is a view expressed to the effect that the revocation or the renunciation of part of their number or the death of one of their number would terminate the agency of all222 The law however is not so and decides that even where part of the number renounce or have their agency revoked the status of the remainder is unaffected223 WHERE THERE ARE SUBAGENTS Where authority is given to the agent to appoint a sub agent it is presumed that the power of the latter proceeds from the principal224 and is therefore not affected by the death of the agent who appointed him22 If the principal on the other hand dies the authority of the subagent as well as of the first agent is revoked226 The death of the 219 This may be inferred from Eben haEzer 141 32 This would be a case of nrIll i 1D10 1S 1IK r1 r7 inrlin So too in modern law after occurring insanity terminates agency Storys Agency  487 220 Eben haEzer ibid see

of the first agent does not terminate the relation and the first agent can either proceed with the work himself or appoint another subagent to continue the transaction227 LEGAL EFFECT OF THE RELATION OBLIGATIONS OF PRINCIPAL TO AGENT If an agent is appointed to perform a certain act for his principal he is entitled to be reimbursed for all sums which he has paid out in the course of his agency for his principals benefit The outlays however must be only for the ordinary regular or customary expenses that were reasonably necessary The principal is not responsible for expenses unreasonable in amount or unnecessary for the performance of the agency228 Where the agent in the pursuit of his mission suffered a personal loss either monetary or physical he cannot claim indemnity therefor from the principal229 Even where because of his undertaking the act of agency he would become a captive or a prisoner he cannot demand that his principal shall redeem him230 The AngloAmerican law discusses at length the ques tion whether or not an agent may claim indemnity for the consequence of his act if the act was illegal but the agent was ignorant of its illegality and comes to the conclusion that the agent has this right Thus an auctioneer who innocently sells for his principal goods belonging to a third person is entitled to indemnity in case he is obliged to 227 Eben haEzer 141 42 228 Isserles Hosh Mish 182 3 Cf for a similar ruling Maitland v Martin 86 Pa St 120 Goodman v Meisel 65 Ind 32 Roman law also held that man dator was bound to recoup the mandatory for expenses incurred 229 Hosh Mish 188 6 230 Isserles to Hosh Mish 176 48 Where however he is a gratuitous agent the prevailing opinion is that he can demand of his principal to liberate him ibid In modern law the agent is entitled to indemnity against the consequences of all acts performed in the due execution of his authority which are not illegal or due to his own default Cf DArcy v Lyle 5 Binney Pa 441 Saveland v Green 36 Wis 612 173THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW respond to the true owner for conversion23 In Jewish law this problem could not arise because the agent cannot be sued once he acted on good faith not knowing that the act was illegal232 The principal alone in a such a case would be responsible and he alone could be sued by the injured party233 OBLIGATIONS OF AGENT TO PRINCIPAL MUST OBEY PRINCIPALS INSTRUCTIONS If the principal in appointing the agent specified certain conditions which he desires the agent to perform in connection with the act of agency these conditions must be fulfilled by the agent If he goes beyond his power he does not effect anything that is his acts are void Thus if A authorizes B to sell his house to one man and B sells it to two the sale is invalid234 Or235 if A sends B to pay a debt which he owes to C with the instruction to take back from C the note which he holds as proof of the debt and if B returns the money without asking for the note B the agent will be responsible for any loss that A may suffer thereby236 The principle underlying these and sim ilar rules of the law is expressed in the words that the principal may always say to his agent il 1nmT n3pn1 rnlmy You are to benefit me by your service and not to injure me237 231 Adamson v Jarvis 4 Bing 66 Castle v Anoyes 14 N Y 329 cf Bibb v Allen 149 U S 481 232 See above p 164 233 Cf also ivn nns to Hosh Mish 182 3 beginning tll XQ nrviw where a somewhat similar case of indemnity is discussed 234 Maim I 4 235 ibid I 6 Cf Ketub 85a 236 If however the principal when authorizing the agent did not mention the note the principal cannot hold the agent if the latter returned the money without asking for the note ibid 237 Ketub 99b B Bat 169b Kidd 42b 174THE JEWISH LAW OF AGENCYLEVINTHAL GOOD FAITH Thus anything done by the agent that tends to work harm to the principal invalidates the act and cannot affect the principal Thus if the Mursheh violates his trust by selling his power of attorney to the debtor or by cancel ling the debt the act as affecting the principal will be of no value unless of course the authority was granted with the accompanying condition that whatever the agent will do shall bind his principal238 NEGLIGENCE OF AGENT The agent whether paid or gratuitous is obligated to use reasonable care in whatever he undertakes to do else the principal may hold him liable for any loss sustained239 Thus if A gave money to B wherewith to purchase wheat and B did so but placed the wheat in a house where the rain was likely to injure it the agent will be held respon sible for the damage occasioned thereby240 As TO HONESTY OF AGENT If the agent pleads that he met an accident and thereby sustained a loss in the article belonging to the principal then if the agent can bring witnesses to prove his claim he is relieved from all liability for his loss If he cannot bring any witnesses then if the accident occurred at a time and place at which it was not likely that others should witness it the agent must take the oath that is usually administered in such cases to bailees and he will not be held further responsible But where the accident happened in a public place where witnesses were undoubtedly present 239 Maim III 9 Qp 11Dt l3n  D 239 So too in Charlesworth v Whitlaw 74 Ark 277 85 S W 423 Preston v Prather 137 U S 604 In Roman law however an agent though gratuitous must show omnis diligentia failing which he must pay damages 240 Hosh Mish 187 4 175THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW or where it is claimed that the accident was seen by other people the agent in order to be relieved from liability must produce witnesses to prove his claim else the prin cipal may hold him liable for his loss24I In fact if the principal has a suspicion as to the honesty of the agent who represented him in a transaction if he has reason to believe that he did not turn over to him all the money that he made or all the goods that he purchased he has a right to demand that the agent take an oath that he did not act dishonestly This he may do even though the agent was a gratuitous one and derived absolutely no benefit from his agency242 AGENTS LIABILITY FOR Loss We noted above that in their legal effect there is no difference between the Sarsor and the gratuitous Shaliat243 There is however a difference in the cases where the agent bears a liability to his principal for money or articles be longing to the latter The Sarsor receiving pay for his services is regarded like a Ditv inl paid bailee and is therefore held responsible also in the case where the article is lost or stolen244 The Shaliah who serves gratuitously is regarded as the Din inlw gratuitous bailee and is held liable only in the case of gross negligence24s and is free from liability in all other cases AGENT WHO FAILS TO PERFORM An agent whether paid or gratuitous cannot be held liable for a mere nonfeasance where he has never entered upon the undertaking Thus if A says to B Here is money purchase therewith some fruit for me and B fails to pur 241 Maim II 9 IHosh Mish 187 1 2 242 Maim IX 5 243 See above p 130 244 Hosh Mish 185 7 He is held liable even if he lost it while on the way to return it ibid 245 Cf for a similar ruling in case of gross negligence in gratuitous agency White head v Greitham 2 Bing 464 176THE JEWISH LAW OF AGENCYLEVINTHAL chase A has no legal redress246 While the rabbis do not allow him any legal claim they imply that the agent in not fulfilling this agency did not act in a fitting manner and the principal has cause for nlnyinn moral grievance and complaint WHERE AGENT BUYS FOR HIMSELF INSTEAD OF FOR THE PRINCIPAL We have just seen that an agent is not held legally liable when he fails to perform an act of agency which he has undertaken to perform We have also learned that an agent may renounce his agency at all times247 An interesting question now arises Suppose A appointed B to purchase for him certain goods B does not purchase it for A but does purchase it for himself Has A any claim against B Logically following out the above rules it would seem that he has not He can claim that he renounc ed his agency in behalf of A So too he can say to A If I had not purchased it at all you would have had no legal redress Why should you be able to hold me liable if I bought it for myself This argument is a logical and a valid one on one condition however and that is if the agent made no use of the principals money in conducting the transaction for himself This is evidently the view of the Talmud While it does not countenance his act though he used his own money in the transaction and even terms him a rnn cheat for acting in such fashion it nevertheless rules that the principal has no legal claim against him The Talmud derives its ruling from the fol lowing interesting case If A commissions B to marry for him C and B marries her himself she remains the wife of 246 Maim I 5 VII 6 Hosh Mish 183 1 Cf T J B M lOb So also in modern law in case of gratuitous agency cf Thorne v Dios 4 Johns N Y 84 247 Above p 170 177THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW B though Bs action is not to be regarded as honorable248 But it is to be remembered that the case applies only where the agent used his own money in marrying C where how ever he used the money of his principal it is held that the marriage to B is not valid249 And so too Maimonides states the law that where the agent put aside the purchase money that he took from the principal in order to return it to him and used his own money in purchasing the articles for himself the principal has no legal redress though it is the action of a ni cheat250 But on the other hand where the agent used the money of the principal the latter may compel him to turn the goods thus purchased over to him and if the agent instead of keeping the goods for himself resold it to another and made profit out of the transaction he may be compelled to give up to the principal all that he thus earned 25I Even if the agent in using that money declared himself a borrower of his principal he cannot keep the article for himself as long as the money used was that entrusted to him by the principal252 A compromise view is suggested by the Maggid Mish neh that if the agent before purchasing the goods for him self renounces his agency before witnesses in such a case he may declare himself a borrower of his former principal 248 Kidd 58b 59a Cf Eben haEzer 35 9 Where however the woman ex pressly stated that she does not want to marry his principal but is willing to marry him the agent he may do so and his action will not be regarded as the act of a O1 Cf Tosefta Yebamot ch 4 nlpr  p npl X   mns nl K r pl Kq 11n 11nt I 11l I9 and the Gaon R Elijah Wilnas emendation li9DT nprD ntl3 nMlln1 ibid According to the Gaon the agent is a HDO cheat only in the case where the principal desig nated the third party from whom he was to purchase the article otherwise principal would have cause for nlDlyln grievance only Where however the article purchased was something of unusual valueas an antique 1Y lV7 130N3there even according to the Gaon the agent would be a cheat if he purchased it for himself even though the principal did not specify the party from whom the purchase was to be made ID BD ilDt 7 ibid 249 Cf Dl1 n1r and 1ttr1 to Tur Eben haEzer 35 9 both quoting the Mordecai who states that the Talmud must be understood in this fashion 250 Maim Mekirah VII 10 251 Maim Mekirah VII 12 Cf Hosh Mish 183 1 2 252 Hosh Mish 183 3 cf Maim ibid 178THE JEWISH LAW OF AGENCYLEVINTHAL and purchase for himself253 There is however very little warrant for this view in the Talmud and Maimonides and AlFasi expressly state that even where he can prove that he renounced his agency before witnesses he cannot purchase for himself but must deliver the goods to his principal254 Where the agent can prove that the third party did not care to deal with the principal but was willing to deal with him in that case the agent is permitted to purchase the goods for himself but he must of course use his own purchase money Even here however he is in duty bound to first make the fact known to his principal Where there is a possibility that while he will take the time to notify his principal the goods will be sold to another he may purchase it immediately and inform his principal of the fact after the transaction25s CAN AN AGENT SELL TO HIMSELF In the case where an agent authorized to sell something for his principal purchases the article for himself we see a striking similarity in the decisions of the Jewish law and the modern cases The general rule is that an agent can not purchase such goods for himself even at the stipulated price that the agent was authorized to sell unless he has the express consent of his principal2s6 Where the agent paid him the money he asked as its purchase price and the principal accepted it agreeing to the sale the sale is of course valid and the principal cannot afterwards cancel it257 Where the price was not specified by the principal 253 Maggid Mishneh to Maim Mekirah VII 12 254 Cf Isserles Hosh Mish 183 3 255 Maim Mekirah VII 11 Hosh Mish

Hosh Mish 185 3 179THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW there is no doubt that under no circumstances can the agent sell to himself If the agent did sell tohimself and afterward resold it to another at a profit the principal can demand the sum thus realized plus the profit2s8 This rule prohibiting the agent to sell to himself was so strictly fol lowed that even in the case where a principal appointed an agent to sell his field the latter could not purchase it for himself even though he was a 1nD i e had the prero gative of a neighborthe right of preemption2s5 Not only that but by acting as agent the law assumes that he has given up the rights that he had before and thus if he sold the field to a third party and he is himself a lnsx he is afterwards denied the right to pay off the purchaser and to take the land for himself26o The Roman and the English law base their decisions on the ground that the relationship is founded on the con fidence that the principal reposes in the agent and there fore that the agent dare not do anything that may tend to violate this faith of the principal Jewish law bases its decisions in these cases also upon the element of con fidence and says that by selling to himeself the agent is tempted to show lack of that good faith that he must al ways display261 The rabbis however have another reason to justify their strictness Carrying the principle inlim imnnn tnb w A mans agent is like himself to a logical conclusion they say that even where there is no doubt as to the good faith of the agent as where he was told to sell at a specified price he is not permitted because the prin cipal can say to his agent Who sold it to you I appointed you to sell and selling comprises the transfer 258 Responsa of ltnn1 quoted by 30D1 lK ibid 185 2 Cf Motley v

represent the third party as well as his own principal in the same transaction is not definitely decided In the matter of divorce the law re mains undecided whether the wife can appoint as her agent to receive the get the party who is also serving as her husbands agent to deliver it to her263 An agent who is appointed to collect a debt or to pay a debt can act in behalf of the third party But this is an exceptional case as we can see from the rulings above mentioned because of the principle r tl r DuRt lpr of benefiting a person in his absence In fact the moment the money is placed in his hands to deliver to the third party he automatically be comes in legal effect the representative of the third party though his principal remains responsible for its safe de livery264 In the ordinary cases of selling or other business transactions the matter remains undecided265 though it seems to me that he should not be able to represent both All such cases require transfer of property from one pos session to another By his acting for both such a transfer would be impossible266 As TO EXTRA PROFITS When the agent engaged in a certain transaction in 262 Cf Tur 185 3 in the name of Rashba But

his principal or sells it at a higher price than that mentioned by him the extra profit belongs to the princi pal267 Thus if A commissioned B to purchase for him wheat at a certain price and B succeeded in getting it at a lower price the amount thus saved is for the benefit of the principal268 So too if the agent is given an extra measure or larger weight by the third party the extras also belong to the principal We noted previously the case where a principal tells his agent to sell the article for four dollars and the agent is successful in getting six Here too the decision is that the surplus profit belongs to the principal269 The rabbis however limit the application of this general rule only to those cases where the article sold or bought has no market value The agent is in duty bound to do his best to serve his principal Where there is no market value we assume that the agent did thus serve faithfully and tried to get as much as possible for him in whose behalf he served When however the article had a definite market value the rabbis decree that the surplus gain is to be divided equally between the agent and the principal270 For both have equally just claims the agent can claim The gain is mine as it was meant for me inas much as the price paid was more than its market value The principal again can say You made the gain in my transaction and through the use of my money or goods The profit is therefore divided between them giving satis faction to both27I 267 Maim I 5 Tur 185 1 3 Cf Ketub 98b 268 Maim ibid 269 Above p 135 Tur ibid 270 Maim ibid Hosh Mish 183 6 When the third party states expressly that he gave the extra measure to the agent himself the principal cannot claim it Cf Isserles ibid quoting RaN and a response of RaMBaN 271 Both the Roman and the English law sternly prohibit the agent from keeping unto himself profit or gain accrued but must in all cases turn it over to principal 182THE JEWISH LAW OF AGENCYLEVINTHAL 183 WHERE THE AGENT WENT BEYOND THE POWERS CONFERRED UPON HIM We have already mentioned the principle underlying the whole relationship between the agent and his principal namely that the principal can always say to him ipn nllm Nl 1lnnnrt you have been appointed to benefit me and not to cause me loss This principle is scrupulously followed by the rabbis There is only one exception to it viz where the principal in appointing him conferred upon him unlimited authority in that he expressly agreed to whatever his agent will do whether it will be to his benefit or hurt272 otherwise the rule holds that the principal is not to suffer because of an act done for him by his represen tative Thus a transaction negotiated by an agent may be set aside if the other party to it was guilty of over reaching or if it was a mistaken transaction even though the amount concerned was less than one sixth of the value though if the transaction was negotiated by the principal himself it would not be set aside because onesixth is the limit allowed between parties dealing with each other in person It would be set aside too though the purchase or sale was of land or of a bond to which the law of over reaching does not apply273 Where the agent deviates from his principals instruc tions the transaction may be set aside274 But where because of the transaction the principal is made to suffer loss the agent will be held liable to him for the full amount of his loss If in the same transaction there was a profit or gain the gain on the other hand will belong to the principal This applies with equal force to the gratuitous 272 Maim I 3 Hosh Mish 182 3 273 Maim I 2 Hosh Mish 182 3 cf Ketubot lOOa 274 Hosh Mish 188 5 So too in Roman law if the mandatory exceeds the powers conferred on him by the mandator the latter was not bound by his acts D XVII 1 5THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW as well as to the paid agent275 Thus if A commissioned B to purchase wheat and B purchased barley instead the agent will be held responsible for any loss suffered by the principal in the transaction while if there is a profit the profit will belong to the principal276 We must not confuse the various rulings in these cases when the agent deviates or transgresses from his principals orders The principal may refuse to accept the results of the transaction In that case the transaction is of no value and the principal cannot be held liable either by the agent or by the third party If he wants to avoid the transaction he has a right to do so even if the agent offers to make good any loss sustained27 What we mean when we say that if there is loss in the transaction it must be borne by the agent or if there is a gain it goes to the principal refers to those cases where the principal desires to ratify the transaction in question Here we say that he may do so and in addition he may hold the agent for any loss suffered or for any extra profit made in the transaction In other words a transac tion in which the agent did contrary to his principals instructions is not void but voidable only at the discretion of the principal We shall now be able to better understand a decision as given by Maimonides and stated by the later codes which upon its face seems to be unreasonable but as interpreted by the commentators follows the rule I have just formulated A authorizes B to purchase for him a plot of land from C B buys the land but without taking 275 Maim II 6 I 5 5 Hosh Mish 183 185 1 In Roman law if agent deviates from instructions principal also had right to all advantages but was not responsible for disadvantage Gaius Bk III 161 Inst III 26 8 276 ibid 183 6 The Talmud presents the divergent views of R Meir and R Judah as to this ruling the former regards the very deviation as termination of agency and therefore the agent takes possession for himself According to him the profits as well as the losses will be his R Judah holds that the deviation does not terminate the relation Therefore the profits belong to the principal Where there is a loss the principal may say to him You were to benefit me and not to injure me you must therefore stand the loss Cf B K 102b 277 Tur 188 5 cf ltt comment to the words 7l1 IDO ibid 184THE JEWISH LAW OF AGENCYLEVINTHAL a guarantee of title B must take the land for himself without the guarantee as purchased and A can force B to give him his own personal guarantee278 This decision as it stands seems to be opposed to the general rule that when by the agents carelessness or deviation the principal would suffer the principal could not be held liable in the transac tion And so RABeD rightly asks Why should it be so If there was a mistake in the purchase the principal should have the right to annul the entire transaction And he gives us as answer the statement that this is a case where the principal wanted the land and was willing to ratify the sale even without the third partys guarantee The act was therefore voidable and he had the legal right either to refuse or to accept the land The agent however was careless and did not serve his principal with that spirit of faithfulness and devotion that is required of him He must therefore give to his principal his personal guarantee if the latter desires to ratify his act279 This interpretation could also be inferred from the wording of the law as stated by Maimonides The agent takes the land unto himself without the guarantee and reconveys it to his principal with his own guarantee rmnlyn nmrnl mpl rnn since he purchased it with his principals money The latter phrase has no meaning unless we take it to mean that the principal cannot be forced to purchase the land but if he desires the land he may have it and force his agent to give his own guarantee since he purchased it with his prin cipals money The Talmud in discussing the legal consequences of an agents act if he went beyond that which he was author ized to do makes a fine distinction between the a ent who 278 Maim I 3 Hosh Mish 182 6 In this case it is presumed that the third party expressly told the agent that he will not give a guarantee otherwise the omission of guarantee would be regarded as a scribes error and the guarantee would be inferred Maim Mekirah XIX 3 B B 169b Cf Kesef Mishneh ibid 279 Cf also Kesef Mishneh ibid quoting RaN to the same effect 185THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW totally disregards and violates his principals commission nn b7 y 3nyn  and the one who does perform but who of his own accord adds to the errand of agency something that he was not authorized to do280 inmi by 1Dim The former is a case of nmly injury and the principal has a right to regard the act as invalid in the latter instance the act authorized is valid and binds the principal but the addi tional act done unauthorized is invalid and is voidable at the will of the principal An example of the latter case follows If A engages B to sell one acre of his land and B sold two acres the sale of the one acre authorized is regarded as valid while the sale of the additional acre is cancelled281 Where A engages B to sell two acres and B sells only one there doubt was expressed as to whether this was a case of violation or of simple overstepping his order The law decides that this is a case of violation and the sale of the one acre is therefore held invalid The reason for this ruling seems to be the aversion to troubling the principal to write out several deeds of sale or to making him deal with more than one party282 OBLIGATIONS BETWEEN PRINCIPAL AND AGENT AND THE THIRD PARTY Among the later authorities the opinion gained ground that in a case where the principal desires to have the transaction regarded as invalid because his agent went beyond the powers conferred upon him the third party may in such a dispute with the principal claim that the 280 Ketubot 98b Maim I 4 Hosh Mish 182 8 281 ibid 282 The same ruling applies where the principal ordered him to sell to one party and he sold to two cf ibid Nahmanides quoted in Kesef Mishneh even goes so far in his decision that where the agent sold to two parties on one bill of sale even then it is a case of y3 and the principal can cancel it He can claim that he does not want to bother with several parties It is this reason too that is given for the rule that where an agent says I am purchasing this land for my principal and the deed is written in his principals name he cannot afterwards say I purchased it for myself write me another deed in my name Maim II 5 186THE JEWISH LAW OF AGENCYLEVINTHAL principal has given to the agent this wider authority and the principal will have to bring witnesses to the contrary if he wishes to be relieved of the agents bad bargain283 In all the cases where the principal is given a right to avoid the transaction because of the agents acting beyond his authority it must be noted that this right is conferred upon the principal alone Where the principal is willing to stand by his agents act the third party cannot avoid it on the ground that the agent went beyond his powers284 The rules of law stated in the above chapters with reference to the principals right to disregard all unauthor ized acts of his agent applies only in the case when the third party knew that he was dealing with an agent285 If the third party however did not know that he was dealing with an agent but thought that the agent was dealing for himself the transaction will be regarded as valid between him and the agent and the principal has no legal redress against the third party but must sue the agent for any loss sustained286 Thus the case noted above287 where an agent purchased land without a guarantee and was compelled to take for himself and to reconvey it with his own guar antee to the principal was explained by Rabbenu Nissim to refer to a transaction in which the principal was not disclosed The agent dealing in his own name therefore had to stand by the purchase while the principal if he desired the land could compel the agent to reconvey it to him with his personal guarantee288 We note from this that Jewish law did not adopt the 283 Tur 182 8 quoting RaMA 284 Cf ll I to Hosh Mish 185 6 285 Jewish law does not hold that it is the duty of the agent to disclose his agency cf Rosh to B K 102b Unless the seller at time of sale expressly states that he would sell only to him and not to anyone else in that case he must specify the third party of his appointment or acquire it for himself and the principal will have to acquire it from agent Cf also above note 61 286 Maim II 4 Hosh Mish 182 2 287 Above p 185 288 Cf Kesef Mishneh to Maim I 3 187THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW ruling of the modern law with reference to the undisclosed principal289 Where the agent deals in his own name and does not disclose the fact that he is dealing in behalf of a principal the latter will have no claim upon the third party and the third party will be able to say to him by l16 nr nn Di you are not my adversary I have no dealings with you The third party upon discovering that the transaction was not in the agents own behalf will also not be able to sue the principal for the same reason Whether the principal could be sued by the third party if he makes use of the article purchased by his agent and the agent refuses to pay is a different question and the de cision will rest not upon the rules of agency but upon the ordinary rules of quasicontract Even when there is a dispute between the principal and his agent as to whether the agent fulfilled his commis sion or not e g if the principal claims I told you to sell the article for 100 and the agent says You told me to sell it for 50 and I sold it for that sum if the third party knew that he was dealing with an agent he will have to return the article or money secured to the principal This decision suffices to prove to what extent the rabbis went to protect the principal and also to show how careful a third party had to be when he knew that he dealt with an agent290 Where an agent disposes of his principals property beyond the scope of his authority as for instance where an agent sold an article which he held in his possession that belonged to his principal without being author 289 The Common Law as well as the Roman clung to the doctrine of Privity of Contract Contrary to this doctrine modern law established the sweeping rule that an undiscovered principal may both sue and be sued upon a contract made in his behalf or to his secret use by his agent to the same extent as a disclosed principal although the third party gave exclusive credit to the agent supposing him to be the principal Cothay v Fennel 10BC 671 Kayton v Barnett 116 N Y 625 290 Maim II 6 RABeD ibid disagrees with the decision of Maimonides and rightly says that it opens the way for the principal and the agent to conspire in order to get the article back if they regret the transaction 188THE JEWISH LAW OF AGENCYLEVINTHAL ized to sell it at any specified price the third party will be in duty bound to return it to the principal29I Where the agent has been appointed to deliver a debt due a third party and the third party happens to be indebted to the agent himself for a previous debt the agent can set off or deduct from the money that he collected the amount due him and the third party will have no further claim against the principal This however applies only in the case where this party admits the debt admits that it is now due and also makes claim that he has no other possessions from which the debt can be paid But if he denies the debt or if he has other possessions the agent cannot keep for himself any of the moneys he collected Furthermore if the agent refuses to give up the money the principal can be sued by the third party for the amount292 We have learned above293 that when the agent was deceived in the transaction by the third party even when the amount was a mere trifle less than 16 its value the transaction would be set aside When however the third party had been deceived by the agent the same rule does not apply and he is governed by the onesixth limit allowed between parties dealing with each other in person294 While this view given in the name of R Jonah is the accepted one there is also a strong opposing view Hai Gaon held that just as the agent so also the third party could set aside the transaction if the amount concerned by the agents overreaching was even less than onesixth He compares this case to the one where the Bet Din the Court sells goods in behalf of orphans There the rule of overreach ing is used for the benefit of the purchaser as well as for 291 Maim II 7 Hosh Mish 185 6 but see Isserles ibid So also in modern law cf Thompson v Barnum 49 Iowa 392 292 Hosh Mish 125 3 The modern law does not permit the agent to deduct or to set off a debt due to himself in a matter not arising out of the agency Melvin v Aldridge 81 Md 650 293 Above p 183 294 Tur 182 9 189THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW the orphans R Jonah however points out a distinct difference between the two cases when the Bet Din sells for the orphan it is at the same time the agent of both the orphan and the third party hence the law of overreaching applies to both Here however the agent does not re present the third party and hence the latter cannot in voke the benefit of this rule29s PRESUMPTIONS OF LAW Until there is definite notice of the principals revo cation of his agents power there is a presumption that the agent is authorized to carry out his commission and the third party has the right to rely upon this presumption296 There is also a presumption of law to the effect that lnimnvw vy rntv prptn an agent has done his duty and has fulfilled his commission until the contrary appears297 This presumption has led the rabbis into a discussion of a very complicated nature What would happen if A sent B to marry for him a woman whom he considered suitable and B dies without A knowing with whom he entered into the marriage contract in his behalf The presumption of law being that B fulfilled his commission A would be pro hibited thereafter from marrying any woman who had relatives living lest his marriage would be one in violation of the laws of consanguinity298 His only remedy would be to marry a woman whose immediate prohibited family relations were all dead or one who never had any CONCLUSION The subject of agency is closely allied with other sub jects where certain topics play a most important r6le 295 The Rosh agrees with the latter view which is accepted as the rule of law cf tVc pDl Ketubot XI 17 Bet Yosef to Tur ibid 296 K1I I  Hosh Mish 122 2 cf above p 138 297 Cf Gittin 64a Eben haEzer 35 11 The same presumption is met in modern law cf

that belong to Agency in particular and has omitted all discussions of those rules which while applicable to Agency form subjects in themselves Thus he did not discuss the law pertaining to Oaths though Oaths play a prominent part in the relationship of Agency where there is a dispute between the parties with reference to the acts of the agent299 He has omitted also the law dealing with the eligibility of an agent to give evidence in a dispute in which he is an interested party a subject well treated by all writers on Evidence in Jewish Law3oo The writer has also deliberately omitted discus sions of those laws that deal with agency in religious mat ters e g the question of the priest whether when he per formed the rites of sacrifice he was to be regarded as the representative of the Almighty or the agent of the Israelite who brought the sacrifice or the laws relating to the nrv nTx representative of the Jewish community in their re ligious service The writer believes however that a sufficient presen tation has been made to prove how far advanced nay how almost modern the Jewish rabbis were in their treatment of this complex relationship between a principal and his representative 299 For a discussion of this subject cf Z Frankel Die Eidesleistung der Juden J E Tyler Oaths 300 Cf Z Frankel Der Gerichtliche Beweis nach MosaischTalmudischen Rechte I Blumenstein Die

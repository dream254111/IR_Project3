IT 3 a welllQnown fact that all the ice formed from snow upon the surface of land where the heat of summer is incapable of melting and preventing its gradual increase has a tendency to extend and move downward as water would do according to the same laws in case rain instead of snow had fallen upon the surface Those masses of snow accumulated in high regions of mountain chains even in the hottest parts of the globe gather in the valleys which thus form the natural drainage for the highlandsS and being con gealed into a compact body of ice molre slowly down into lower VOL XXtII JX146 Dr RINK on the Continental Ice of Greenland and and warmer regions till the increasing heat by thawing them sets a limit to their furtller spread These masses of compact ice spreading down through the valleys or clefts and constantly fur nished vith farther supplies by the snow accumulated in the sllr roundin highlands are in Europe seen on the largest scale upon the Alps where they are known under the name of  Gletcher or glaciers It is manifest what an important part they perform in tbe econonly of nature by carrying down into warmer regions the annual excess of snow and ice whicTl without these meanss would continue to increase perpetually on the tops of the ulountains The height at which snow can lie from one wiilter to atlother and form perpetual ice is very diffielent in different latitudes and climates but the depth to vvhich the glaciers are able to carry down the annual excess of perpetual ice is moreover dependent on the height and extent of the snowy regions frort which it receives its suppy In the Alps the lowest glacier line is 3600 feet above the surface of the sea In the Polar regions prirnary snow and ice are found lying at much lower levels than those to which the glaciels descend in the Alpine regions so that glaciers frequently reach down to the very surface of the sea or evet beloun it But the ocean surrounding the aoasts of tiso3e Arctic regions presents a far more striking phenomenon in the masses of floating ice called icebergs WATe shall hereafter have occasion to speak of the nature of these masses alld the conclusions drawn from them as to their origin but here we will lnerely briefly re hearse the common observations of tavellers who have navigated the seas of Greenland on both sides The larger icebergs rise above tlle surface of the sea to the height of from 100 to 150 bet andL upwards and some are 4000 iet in circumference rhe part above can scarcely be considered more than oneeighth of that belota the surface of the water so that the cubic contents of the iceberg may amount to 100000000 of cubic ells or about 6600000 cubic yards a fiagment of ice WhiCll if we suppose it to be fairly landed would form a moulltain about 1000 feet in height All agree that the icebergs of these Arctic seas are originally formed on terra Jrma froln the snow and rains which from the severity of the climate are llever able to reach the ocean in a fluid state but which in the coulse of years are trans fbrmed into a mass of ice and are then throllgh some physical agency thrust forward into the sea But now tixe question arises in urhat coutltry

valleys This opinion has been entertained by 1ll who have observed glacier gletcher valeys as well as floatirlg icebergs but at the same time it would seem strange that the most experienced navigators of the Polar seas have llever mentioned seeing an iceberg pro truding from the shore or thc glaciers in the act of detaching fragments from their mass which in any degree could in bulk be compared to an iceberg althougil the number of these nvhich un questionabl are produced in the Polar regions every year is so surprisingly large It is also with good reason that Scoresby wonders that icebergs are so rarelymet with in the neighbourhood of Spitsbergen although that Polar land is said to be patticularly distinguished by its numerous glaciers reaching down to the sea while on the contrary icebergs are far lnore frequent in Baffin Bay He explains tbis diffierence by the different aaature of the coasts in both places but it will be our business in the subse quent pages to show that a much more esserltial eause produees this differencea eause to be looked for in the nature of those tracts af land in which so great an excess of ice is produced an mlally The author of these pages during a

Ice of Greenland and to that by which the progress of glaciers is eected is thrust forward teu and brought to a point at the place from which the icebergs proceed For the formation of icebergs accordingly a tract of land of a certain extent is necessary in which the sea forms so few and small creeks or inlets that rivers or watercourses of some magnitude must necessarily be present 2 Where the abovementioned condition exists in corljunction with the necessary temperature of the climate the formation of ice does not proceed from certainmountaill heightsbut the wholecountry is covered with ice to a certain elevation mountains and vcllleys are levelled to a uniUform plane the riverbeds clre concealed as well as every vestige of the original form of the counfr31 A movement

continuity proceeds from the shore borne by the sea until some circumstance or other destroys the equilibrium and breaks some fragments off the outer edge which is again thrust forward and again detaches new fragments thus continually renewing the sup plies from the interior 3 A tract or body of land of the requisite size is in the northern helnisphere only fo be found in Greenland and ulore especially in that part which lies to the N of the Arctic Cirele where in the interior beyond the inlets of the sea the country increases in breadth from E to W and affolds space for the original birth place of these large icebergs Neither Spitzbergen rlor the llar rower parts of Greenland nor the peninsula nor the islands which surrounl itS are atlequate in size to produce the yearly excess of indissoluble ice whichXfiom that Iclrye and unknown co7ztinent is rery elozly protraded and as it seems in a lesser degree toward the eastern shores of Greenland alont which the iceberSs are driven past Cape Earewell the greatest quantity going to the W into Baffin Bay The friths or fiords which piercing far into the country receive and transrnit the icebergs are called ice friths The aforementionesl tract of coast along Baffin Bay to which we will confine our present remarks and which is exhibited in the subjoined ttlap is particularly characterised by the deep inlets and branches of the sea  by that mixture of land and waterthat labyrinth of peninsulas and islands by that peculiar configura tion which proviles the means of subsistence to the inhabitants and thus altogether supplies their nourishment from the ocean From the outermost isles these arms of the sea commonly reach from 50 to 100 miles inland where every one of them terminates and where the body of continental larld commences a vast regiontAze Origin of Iceberys in the Jrctic Seas 149 completely destitute of animaI life and buried under a continuous tract of ice which only terminates about 800 miles more to the E in the high unknown latitlldes of eastern GreeIlland Let us sup pose now a line drawn from S to N touching the inner extre mities of all the deep inlets and let llS call the group of peninsulas and islands which lie to the westward of it the out skirts of the land and the compact continent to the E the inland The area of the outskirts of N Greenland may be estimated at about 30000 square miles But the abovementioned divi sionsn with their numerous ramifications Qf inlets and bays cause it to spread over a far greater surEace If we at the saule tilne cllsider its thin popuation and severe climate it is no matter of surprise that this part of Greenlantl has been hitherto so very little klloyvn and that there exist lal ge tracts of country unvisited but by a few natives and diffioult to classify either as islands or as at tached to the continent Most Europeans leave Greenland without even having seen the extensive arld uniform ta61eland of ice which spreads its waste tract over a11 tlle eastern regions and without having ever visited the terlnination of the fiords into which this ice annually throws of its enormous excess in the shape of colossal fraglnents amounting to many millions of cubic feet The places where sucIz lnighty and extraordinary natural phenomena take place are enerally speaking far retnoved to the eastvtrard from the inhabited coastland and all access to them over the inlets and friths on accountof the extraordinary accumu lation of driftice in summer and the breaking up of the solid saltwater ice by the motion of the glaciers in winter is rendered difficult and danerous in the extreme for the explorere But at the mouths of the icy friths we have an opportunity of observing the masse3 which annually pass of into the ocean and we are then perfectly astonished and wonderstruck when we reflect in mhat parts of the country such stupendous quantities of ice carl have been produced and flitted down to one single inlet In considering the outskarts nothing meets our eye that would indicate any cogent reason for such an accumulation of ice even in that severe climate We observe on these 200 square miles of islands and peninsulas the snow and ice of a whole winter lying below the level of 2000 feet annually thaw awanr before the heat of the sun in the month of June a summer heat sufficient to produce the vegetation of several hundred species which blossom and produce ripe seed before the frost of the subsequent early winter calses them to fade at the latter end of August This heat would probably be suf ficient to thaw double or triple the mass of snow produced by the preceding winter before the commencement of the fresh accllmu lations ot its successor Although the mean temperature of the year on this coast is some degrees below the freezing point we here finl the ordinary1a Dr RINE On the Continental Ice of Greenind and law of natXure maintainerd according to which even in warmer clirnes the formation of pertual snow ani ice i3 dependent upon a certain elevation over the surface of the water but here this eleuation is of course less All observations made on this subject lead to the result that somewhat above 2000 feet is the lowest elevation at which a crust of perpetual ice can be formed in this coulltry and that this bighlandice no doubt may spread in ramifications thlough clefts and valleys to the lower couztry and in some instances even doxrn to the ocean but tixat the ice formed at such an elevation with the exceptiQn of sery few cases is only temporary Neithel do we find at the elevation of upwards of 2000 feet perpetual ice and snow in euewy place On the con trary below the 71st parallel of N latitude phanerogamous plants have been found at the elevation of 4500 feet Further it has appeared that the lamifications of the highlandice or gletchers hereS as in other clInes bave a progressave movement This alovement is however extremely slow and the inclease of temperature in the lower regions often lnelS aay their lowel edges so that oSy a few of the largest gletcherse vlthich receive their tribute of ice from a great tract of hiphlandf have been able to reach the coat but the dropped fragments of ice singulady called by the Danish colonists calfice sent forth to the ocean by these glaciers are so inconsiderable that it rtlay be safely asserted that the sum ttal of rain and snow which in the curse of the year falls on the 02ztskirts leaves them again in atluid state At the same time there is an observation founded on experience which may clear up these apparent contradictionsy that the neigh bouring intarzd continent is not only formed into a perfect level of ice but also yields a large excess thereof to the ocean It is of course manitestS that even in the low country there might be brxned a crust of ice altogether indissoluble if only the requisite qualltum of water in due form was exposed to the action of the azlnual frost of eight months ThisSdoes not take place on the fieshwater lakes where the ice rarely attains more than 6 feet thicliness owing to the protection alfforded by the ice itself as well as by the suLowy carpet against the frost If on the con trary throllgh the course of a whole winter water were constantly poured over a surfac prpetually exposed to the action of the atmosphere there would no doubt be formed a crest of ice 20 to 40 feet thick which th short stmmer would be incapable of meltina We see atl apprcyximation to this in seareral parts of the outskirtsS where ruxlning water continues its play during tie winter When the snow in aIl other places is thawed away we observe thick crusts of ice in the neighbourhood of certain wwter springsf which continue running throughout the year Nay even near the seacoast such a formation of ice is found which has never been knowrl for a certainty to hase entirely melted Thsttle Oragtn of Iceberys in the Actic Seas 151 moreover is the case at the mouths of all the larger rivers more particulary where they spread over a delta the bed of which is formed of large stone blocks Such rivers may during winter be ed with water either from watersprings or from lakes vvhether their outlet be lirect or subterranean The main point is that the larger the territory the more difficult it wil be for the water which is received in the course of a summer to gain sufficient time to reach the ocean before the winter frost beqins to stop it in its course But the inland region is particularly distinguished from the outshirts by tile great extent of its watercourses and by the distance over which the latater must pass before it reaches the ocean The old rivers may thllS have been stopped in former times and filled the valleys with ice nthich again may have blelled itself with that from the highlands by which tlle icy covering of the mThole was effeeted bllt now this covering has extended to a height at which the above coilditions for the forma tion of highland ice are renderel ulanecessary rhe exclusive oritin of the icebergs from the inland ice tlirough the icy friths has been lnentioned but where these friths have a certain extent in an easterly direction we find those valleys which ougilt to form their eastern continuation everywhere full of ice and when flom a considerable elevation on the mountainous parts of the coast they may be viewed or explored by vision we observe that they rise and at the same time approach and unite in an icy level oeeupying the whole of the eastern tract or area of the continent The elevation or height above the sea of this icy plasn at its junction with the outskirts of the country and where it begins to lower itself through the valleys to the friths is in the ramifications of the Bay of Omenak found to be 2000 feet from whieh level it gradually rises towards tlle interior The author has in his journeys observed twetythree such icy steps or platforms to whieh must be added five or sis delineated aeeord ing to deseription But although the icy level or plain from whieh they appear to have their eommon origin appears every where to have a uniform deseent thcre is still observable this renlarkable difference that certain of its ramifications are pro truded with far greater force into the friths than others This movement can be measured partly by the power with whith the solid surfaeeice in the bays during winter is broken through or disturbed in it3 usllal strueture and position and partly and more particularly by the quantity of ice which in the form of calfice and of icebergs is annually produced and carried througli the icy friths to the ocean An estimate of the quantities of iee annually transported by the iey friths wlliCh have partly been observed by myself and partly derived from the information given by the inhabitarlts has con152 Dr RINK 0R the Co7ztinental Ice of Greenlazd a7zd vinced me of the existence of five principal icefriths on the coast line frolll 67 to 73 N lat From these nearly all the large icebergs are produced and every one of these illlets receives annually from the inland icy region many thousand cubic feet of ice The principal icefriths are as follows 1 That of Jacobshaven in 69 10 N lat 2 Of rossukatek behind the island of Arvemina in 69 50 N lat 3 The large one of Kariak in 70 ast N lat 4 The still larger one of Kanyeidbursoak in 71 25 N lat both being ramifications of the Bay of Omenak 5 And of Upernivik in 73 N lat behind a large group of islands In cotlsidering the manner in which the ice moves from the in terior down into the icefriths and its breaking up there and how the caluingn or liberation of the floating icebergs is effectel the following special remarks may help to explain and illustrate the earlier views formed on the subject in different records of travels Remembering that all icebergs are fragments let loose from the continental ice it cannot be doubted that the parent mass must at least have been the thickness of the icebergs smallest diameter Accorlingly the ice which is pushed out from the interior thlough a valley into a great icefiith must be considered a plane body of at least a thousand feet in thickness  on account of the brittleness of the material this downgliding motion cannot take place without violent disturbances on which account its sur face resembles a peaked waved and suddenlycongealed sea which besides is cut through bJT nurtterous rents In the meanwhile this weighty plane body preserves its continuity in progressive motion over the old beach on the bottom of the sea unchanged as when on shere till the outer end has reached a depth in which the water begins to bear it up where still preserving its connection it ploceeds thus borne up by the sea till some exterior cause makes the connection cease when the outer end brealss of and becomes a floating iceberg This action is called calvinq and SUCh S the concussion that it sometimes sets the sea in motion to a distance of 16 miles From the above it is evident that icebergs cannot be con3idered as breaking off from the coast it would be more proper to say that they rise out of the sea for in general the icebergs advancing in front of the continental ice from whence they proceed are higher at the inner end tllan at the outer enll which seems to be somewhat pressed down by tbe part behind while it is gliding down the rocks at the bottom Sontinental ice or gletchers which are exposed to much action of the sea  Most icebergs are upwards of 1600 feet thick and draw more than 200 Stlloms waterF B1 tV s tJ c the Origiza of Iceberys iza the Arctic Seas produce only small icecalves and no iceberys7 or at best of small sizeo It is uncertain whether the continental ice advances gradually antl reularly or periodically Its breaking or calving is altoether independent of this3 as it seems to depend on outward causes in such wise that the station or limit to which the ollter end may attain is uncertain and may sometimes proceed mllch further witAtout breaking than at other times so that earen in the severest part of the winter it may send of large icebergs into the ocean From November to June the saterS in which the icebergs are to proceed to the ocean is so covered by the ocean ice that thev are shut up in the inner icefriths but in Julfr and especially in August they are carried in mass by the current to the open sea rhis is called the shooting out of the icefriths which lasts till late in the autumn when the continual easterly storms finally clear out the inner waters unless the icebergs are intercepted by certain banks on which they sometimes remain long aground lt has been said above that those parts of the inlclndr ice which are thus moved strongly down to certain friths and which we have called icewurrents may be assumed as pointing out the directions of the old rivers which flowed through the cuntry before it was entirely covered with ice and before the valleys through which they ran were level as they now are with the tops of the moun tains As in milder climes the water is carried away fFom the land in a fluid state through rivers here it is gathered and carried away detachedly in the frozen condition of zeecurrents We are especially led to this consideration by the quantity of the animal productson in such places wllere we could expect to see mouths of rivers forming outlets to a large continent It is cer tain that in the interior of the ice reservoirs of water are pre served throughout the year in some places mighty springs are seen to come forth under its outer edge pouring out clayey upater in continued quantity througllout the winter but it is pro bable that such masses of water discllarge themselves through fissure3 of the continelltal ice in those places where it rxloves quickest down towards the great icefriths This flowing water in the interior of alld under the ice may perhaps contribute towards explailling its motion over large tracts of land in the direction of the icefriths Icebergs cotlsist mostly of hard brittle ice of which the white colour originates from very fine lineal pores uniformly divided through the whole mass all being of the same size equidistant and parallel tllroughout the whole iceberg This uniform structure may have arisen at the time it was brmed in the interior of the country from corned snowperhaps repeatedly thawed and frozen The white iceberg is in many directions crossed by broad stripes of intense bluecoloured ice which is154 Capt ALLEN on the Is7and of Raad North Syrict quite clear and either contains no airbladders or at a11 events very irregular ones These blue stripes are several feet in dimension and in them are generally found dirt bands of foreign matters such as stones gravel and clay which the ice bergs carry off embodied in them The blue ice is hy thawing dissolared into regular large grains which is not the case witil the white ice that forms the main mass of the icebergs It seems probable that these blue stripes are formed by a filling up of the fissures in the inland ice with water perhaps mixed with snow gravel and stones and such a refirigeration of the water in the fissures may be supposed to be an important agency in setting in motion these great mountains of ice  I XI On the Island of Rtuad lVortAl Syria By Capt VILTIAM ALLEN RN  FRS FR GS Read June 141852 THE power and prosperity of Tyre probably owed its rise to the simple advantage of aol island lying near a fertile coast devoid of harbours It is one among the

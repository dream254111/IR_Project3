Expedition from Port Denison to Rockingham Bay in Queensland By A J Scott Communicated through the Colonial Office The Expedition which was under the leadership of Mr Dalrymple was undertaken with tbe object of ascertaining whether there was the possibility of establishing a drayroad from the Yalley of Lagoons to Rockingham Bay which the writer described as a flrstclass port only 75 miles distant from tbe Lagoons while Port Denison tbe present port of shipment is upwards of 200 miles The Paper was accompanied by an official letter on tbe subject of the expeditionApril 11 1864 FROM PORT DENISON TO ROCKINGHAM BAY 111 from his Excellency Sir George Bowen to the Duke of Newcastle from which the following are extracts  The station occupied by Mr Scott and his partners on which they have already placed above 25000 sheep and cattle is situated at a distance of more than 1000 miles from Brisbane in the fine pastoral country surrounding the  Valley of Lagoons on the basaltic tableland first discovered by Dr Leichhardt This rich and beautiful plateau though so far within the tropics tbe Valley of Lagoons lying between the 18th and 19th degrees of south latitude enjoys a healthy and delightful climate owing to its con siderable elevation above the level of the sea In June Mr Scott found tbe water of the Lagoon sometimes frozen over in the morning with ice that would bear a pebble thrown on it The present port of shipment for tbe Kennedy District is tbe town of Bowen at Port Denison distant above 300 miles  while Rockingham Bay is distant less than 100 miles from the Valley of Lagoons Foreseeing tbat it would become an object of vital importance to tbe settlers in the northern part of the Kennedy District to have a nearer port of shipment I carefully examined tbe neigbbouring coast in September 1862 in conjunction with the late Commodore Burnett onmy return in HMS Pioneer from my expedition to Cape York Commodore Burnett was of opinion that there are two good anchorages in Eockingbam Bay at either of which a port might be opened It remained to discover a gap practicable for bullockdrays in the mountainrange which runs parallel to the coast and this was the main object of the expedition described in tbe enclosed Eeport A ship will shortly be despatched to meet another overland party at Eockingham Bay where a new port will probably be opened in the course ofthe year 1864 The Paper after describing the overland course from Port Denison to the Valley of Lagoons proceeded to narrate the journey in search of a passage through the coastrange A detachment of the party first marcbed to Mount Lang 30 miles distant from tbe Lakes with a view to ascertaining from its summit the most practi cable route Mount Lang is a hill composed of basaltic rock and lava rising abruptly to the height of about 800 feet from the table land Mr Scott supposed it to be tbe crater of an extinct volcano and mentioned having three times crossed streams of lava flowing from the northward into the Valley of Lagoons Deep fissures and chasms occur frequently in these streams some of which are full of water green clear and of immense depth the vigour of the vege tation

great beauty clothes the sides and the tops of the lavastreams On reaching the summit of Mount Lang a clear view of the coastrange to the east was obtained distant about 40 miles and a low gap was discovered towards which the whole party then directed their steps The needle when placed on the rocks was found to be deflected four points easterlya circum stance which Mr Scott believes to have led Leichhardt to place Mount Lang several miles too far to the westward The region between the Lakes and the coastrange is undulating and consists of open forest country with long narrow plains and rich abundant pasture In traversing it they met with several camps of natives who resort here to hunt kangaroos and who are a fine athletic race of much lighter colour than the natives of the south In some of the camps representations of men and women in the attitudes of the  corro boree  were seen drawn with a sharp stone on the inside of box bark About 9 miles from the junction of the Great Antill Creek with the Burdekin they came upon a chain of lagoons the southern mostof which about 3 miles in circumference was named by the party  Lake Lucy Beyond this the travelling became very difficult owing to the boggy nature of the soil and at apoint distant only 20 miles from the Pelican Lakes their first startingpoint the party were compelled to retrace their steps to the Valley of the Burdekin in search of a more practicable route to the northeast The valley of the river itself seemed to offer the desired opening It averaged about 2 miles in breadth Numerous lagoons covered with waterlilies of various kinds lay along both sides of the channel and there was most excellent pasture The country on the tops of the ridges which bounded the valley was of a very inferior description the grass being worthless for pasturage and the timber stunted During two days they were obliged to travel along the valley but afterwards finding the ground more firm on the tops of the ridges they ascended and thus advanced 25 miles to the northeast At this point they came upon a branch of the Burdekin flowing from the southeast and found extreme difficulty in fording it owing to the boggy nature of its banks From their encamp ment on the right bank of this stream they heard the distant roar of waters which was afterwards ascertained to proceed from a cascade 20 miles away Continuing their course next day 15 miles to the northeast among the hills of the coastrange they encamped at a point where a view of the sea was obtained Goold Island being distinctly visible A deep gorge was then seen stretching to the northwest between their position and the highest part of the coastrange the sides were precipitous and about 1000 feet highApril 11 1864 FROM PORT DENISON TO ROCKINGHAM BAY 113 Through this gorge flows in its course towards Eockingham Bay a large river which Mr Scott supposed to be the same that formed the large waterfall in escaping from the tableland through the coastrange The party now descended in a thick fog to a small valley at the foot of the range On following the stream flowing through this valley for a few miles they discovered that it must be one of the heads of the Burdekin so the obvious inference was tbat they might have followed the river up to this point without crossing tbe range at all The country now opened out and a succession of lightlytimbered forestridges was seen abundantly grassed and watered by small streams They continued their journey to tbe southeast and at a distance of 15 miles from their previous encampment passed over to the watershed of Eockingham Bay The land on tbe coast was flat and apparently swampy In the range was an opening formed by tbe valley of the large river already mentioned flowing from the westward Mount Lang bore a little to the north of west and Goold Island nearly due east To the southwest Mr Scott could trace the valley of the Burdekin the whole way to the Pelican Lakes by which a road might be obtained without any obstacle It was impossible however to reach the coast owing to the impenetrable tropical jungle extending on all sides  an attempt was made but they were obliged to desist and finally to return to tbe station in the Valley of Lagoons Tbe author concluded by declaring the intention of himself and party to undertake another journey for the purpose of opening a road adducing in proof of the necessity of the road the rapid progress of settlements in this extremely rich pastoral district In three years tbe stations of tbe Queensland colonists bad been pushed for ward 500 miles towards the north and a territory as large as the British Isles had been during tbe last two years more or less densely occupied by the flocks and herds of the squatter In another year the advancing settlements would reach the shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria The Presiuent said that the Paper was of great value not only from the character of the gentleman who is a Fellow of the University of Oxford and a settler in the country but from the very clear manner in which he had described the products of the country He had proved himself a good geographer in determining all the positions that he visited by latitude and longitude It was a valuable addition to our knowledge of Australia and showed how inviting a field for eolonisation Queensland must he The author stated that the climate agreed well with Europeans and that large flocks of sheep are thriving in that very latitude in which some gentlemen thought sheep could not flourish Sir Charles Nicholson suggested that the discussion should be taken after the next Paper had been read

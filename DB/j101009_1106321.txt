no wrong receives a Damage by Wild An new force in a decision lately rend imals under State ered by the Supreme Court of New Protection York in Barrett v State of New York Barrett with other individuals owned valuable timber land in the State of New York on Eagle Creek an inlet of one of the lakes known as the Fulton Chain Between the lake and the creek was a splendid stretch of wooded land many of the trees being poplars Beavers felled nearly all these trees and practically ruined the land for camping or any other purpose The beaver is protected by the game laws of New York and Barrett brought suit in the Court of Claims for damages The Court of Claims awarded the injured owners 1900 for the daniage done the Appellate Division affirmed the claim but the Court of Appeals reversed the lower courts and dismissed the matter It was explained that the fur of the beaver was considered so valuable by the early settlers that its image was placed upon the seals of New Netherlands and New York Because of the fur the little animals were relentlessly hunted and killed so that by 1900 they were practically exterminated in the state only ab6ut fifteen of them being scattered over the wide stretches of the southern part of Franklin County The Legislature laid its pro tecting hand upon them in 1900 and again four years later enacted laws providing that they should be immune from human interfer ence while abroad and at home Later 1500 was appropriated to restock the forests with beaver and in 1906 twentyone of the animals were liberated These did so well in their lawprotected lives that they multiplied amazingly On Eagle Creek only four beavers were turned loose204 3 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S  July but these four have grown to four score or more The beaver loves some kinds of trees better than others but he loves the pop lar as well as any and he will girdle with his sharp teeth the very largest of these and when they fall he will with infinite patience cut the branches into suitable lengths and pull or tow them to the places selected for his home Barrett contended in court that the law could not protect ani mals that were destructive that the Legislature knew of the beavers destructive tendencies when the protecting laws were en acted and therefore the state was responsible for the damage done But the Court of Appeals would not accept this argument Its opinion said The general right of the Government to protect wild animals is too well established to be now called in question The own ership is in the State in its sovereign capacity for the benefit of all the people Their preservation is a matter of public interest They are a species of natural wealth which with out special protection would be destroyed Everywhere and at all times Governments have assumed the right to prescribe how and when they may be taken or killed The police power is not to be limited to guarding merely the physical or material interests of the citizens His moral intellectual and spiritual needs may also be considered The eagle is preserved not for its use but for its beauty The same thing may be said of the beaver They are one of the most valuable of the furbearing animals of the State They may be used for food But apart from these consid erations their habits and customs their curious instincts and intelligence place them in a class by themselves Observation of the animals at work or play is a source of neverfailing interest and instruction If they are to be preserved expe rience has taught us that protection is required If they cause more damage than deer or moose the degree of the mischief done by them is not so much greater or so different as to require the application of a special rule If the preserva tion of the former does not unduly oppress individuals neither does the latter The attempt to introduce life in a new environment does not always result happily The rabbit in Australia the mon goose in the West Indies have become pests The English sparrow is no longer welcome Certain of our most trouble some weeds are foreign flowers Yet Governments have made such experiments in the belief that the public goodwould be promoted Sometimes they have been mistaken Again the attempt has succeeded The English pheasant is a valuable addition to our stock of birds But whether a success or a failure the attempt is well within Governmental powers If this is so with regard to foreign life still more is it true with regard to animals native to the State still exist ing here when the intent is to increase the stock upon what the Constitution declares shall remain forever wild forest lands If the State may provide for the increase of beaver by prohibiting their destruction it is difficult to see why it may not attain the same result by removing colonies to a more favorable locality or by replacing those destroyed by fresh importations Nor are the cases cited by the respondents controlling It is true that one who keeps wild animals in captivity must see to it at his peril that they do no damage to others But it is not true that whenever an individual is liable for a cer tain act the State is liable for the same act In liberating these beaver the State was acting as a Government As a trustee for the people and as their representative it was doing what it thought best for the interests of the public at large Under such circumstances we can not hold that the rule of such cases as those cited is applicable This reasoning may seem all right from a poetical standpoint but to apply the cool logic of the doctrine of right and wrong to the case in point it does seem to us that Barrett was entitled to damages It is true the public good may be promoted by the protection of beaver and other wild animals But is not the public good promoted when the state allows its power of eminent domain to be exercised to construct a railroad and to that end to take private property But the law is too well settled for more than bare mention that private property cannot be taken for public use without compensation to the owner Does not the same rule applyor should it not applyto the damage of private property for promotion of public good and if the state sees fit to protect an animal that damages private property ought it not pay for the damage Now this protection of wild animals by the state raises and has raised some very nice questions Has a citizen the right to kill a stateprotected animal caught in the act of destroying the citizens property The law of self defense per 1917  205 EDITORIAL206 3 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S  July mits a man to kill a human being in defense of his person or property Both deer and bear are protectedcertainly during certain seasonsin many states Could any one contend that a man could not kill a buck about to attack him or a bear advanc ing upon him no matter what the season or what the extent of protection Would not a citizen have the right to kill a bear carrying off a pig or a lamb If so then why could not Barrett kill these beaver when he finds ihem destroying his timber And yet some of the state Courts have held that a man has no right to kill a deer out of season even though the deer was destroy ing his wheat Blood letting in the streets of Venice may have once been held to prevent a surgeon from bleeding a pa tient in the streets of that city but we do not believe any de cision affirming a conviction of a man killing a stateprotected animal engaged in the destruction of his property could be upheld upon any reasonable ground Where the state was liable for damages in case of such destruction then the killing might not be justified but certainly no man ought to be left without a remedy where actual material damage is done him Damnum absque injuria ought never to be construed Injuria absque damnum We never imagined that a waiters tips would become a sub ject of litigation That they have long been an object of ab juration we know by personal experience Tips as a Part of And yet in England as far back as 1908 a Wages waiters tips were held to be a matter of right and now the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York has applied the English rule to a taxicabmans tips The Court holds that these tips received by a taxicab driver form a partof his average earnings for the purpose of computing the amount to be paid him under the Workmens Compensation Act in case of his death The Court says The person rendering the service considers that the tip is his as a matter of right and involves no particular favor An extra large tip may be appreciated but the ordinary tip is considered a payment of money actually due The usualtips have come to be considered a part of the cost of the entertainment at a hotel upon a sleeper or public convey ance and it is realized both by the persons paying and re ceiving them that it is a part payment of the wages which the employer compels the person served to pay It seems to us that the vice in this decision is in treating the tip as a part of the wages which the employer compels the person served to pay The employer cannot compel the person served to pay any tip It is a mere gratuity entirely at the will of the person served A growing number of people decline to pay any tips though if they be wise they will not seek another meal at the hands of the waiter they forgot or drive with a chauffeur who remembers them But it is absolute nonsense to talk of the tip as something compelled by the employer to be paid by the person served The tippee is the one who com pels it or the moral cowardice of the tipper compels him to do something he knows ought not to be required of him and need not be required had people the wisdom or moral courage to re sist such payment Can any one contend that the employer could sue the tipper who refused to tip or that the tippee could sue for the pour boire Heaven save usPour manger or pour fumer ought to be the term in all prohibition countries Until that becomes the law the tip doesnt any more enter into the legal wage than the actual drink which used to be given in kind or the old dress the young lady leaves to the maid at the house where she has been visiting The Federal District Court of the United States in the case of United States v One Automobile 237 Federal Reporter 891 holds that it is not Why The reason Is an Automobile ing of the judge does not in our judgment a Wagon fully explain The learned judgeone Bourquin by namewho evidently does not own an autoexpresses himself as follows after saying that in 1864when the act permitting the forfeiture of wagons used in introducing liquor into Indian countries was passed autos did not exist and under which the case arose 1917  207 EDITORIAL208 3 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S  July Though steam had been experimentally used in road vehicles as early as the last quarter of the eighteenth century it was not until great improvements in steel making and working and in tools the invention of the gas engine and its adap tation to liquid fuel in the 70s and 80s that motor road vehicles were recognized as practical and it was yet later that the autorlobile was developed to a degree that while it is a tremendous and valuable industry it is also an incen tive to great public and private extravagance and debt too largely owned more or less conditionally by those not more than six lengths ahead of the wolf infesting the public streets contemptuous of the rights of pedestrians like Jehu driving furiouslya rare combination of luxury necessity and waste In their involved and complicated structure and propulsive force they are the ahtipodes of wagons Now all this is mighty pretty and especially the dictum in re gard to extravagance and the concluding sentences but what has all this to do with the case What is a wagon and what did the statute mean We do not have to go very far to find the definition of a wagon As far back as the first American from the eleventh London Edition of Dr Samuel Johnsons Dictionary 1819 we find a wagon defined as a heavy carriage for burdens Surely this definition is as good in 1917 as it was in 1819 or in 1864 In Quigley v Gorham 5 Cal 418 63 Am Dec 139 a wagon is defined as a common vehicle for the transportation of goods wares and merchandise of all descriptions but the term was held not to include a hackney coach The Century Dictionary defines a wagon to be A four wheeled vehicle specially a four wheeled vehicle designed for the transfer of heavy loads or for various purposes of business transportation of goods etc etc Now it does seem to us that when the intent of the statute is taken into consideration the term wagon might well apply to any vehicle whose description fitted the one given by Dr Johnson or by The Century Diction ary Automobile is a generic term for self propelling vehicles An auto truck is no less an automobile though it does not belong to the Jehu driving furiously class which the learned judge so feelingly anathematizes Yet it in every way fits the defini tion of a wagon The intent of the statute was to prevent thetransportation of liquor into Indian countries and to forfeit the vehicle transporting them To carry out that intention every reasonable interpretation ought to be given to the words of the statute and if an automobile can be defined to be a wagon by any reasonable interpretation of the word then the Court ought to have upheld the confiscation of the automobile caught with the goods We had hoped in this number to have published the very able opinion of Hon C B Garnett Chairman of our State Corporation Commission refusing the dis The Dissolution solution of the TideWater  Western of Public Serv Railroad Company which had taken the nec ice Corpora essary steps to dissolve itself under Section tions by Their 30 of Chapter 5 of the Act entitled An act Own Act Concerning Corporations which became a law on the 21st day of May 1903 all the stockholders practically having voted for a dissolution This opinion came in too late for insertion in the present issue of the REGISTER but we expect to publish it in the next number and are sure that it will create a strong impression of the dan ger threatening communities in this State if such a dissolution was allowed without a full fair and complete hearing before the Corporation Commission and that then no such dissolution ought to be allowed in the case of a public service corporation until the public interested should have had a full and fair hearing It is rather amusing to read in one of the daily journ als of the State the solemn assertion that the Corporation Com mission has no right to pass upon the constitutionality of an act of the General Assembly Hon J Richard Wingfield in a concurring opinion quoting Commonwealth v Atlantic Coast Line Railway Company 106 Va clearly demonstrates that the Commission has as much right to declare an act uncon stitutional as any other tribunal Judge Cardwell who delivered the opinion of the Court says The learned Attorney General as the highest law officer of the Cdmmonwealth urged upon the Commission that in 4 1917  209 EDITORIAL3 VIRGINIA IAW REGISTER N S this proceeding it was invested with all the powers and had imposed upon it all the responsibility of a court of record He earnestly contended that the Commission not only had the judicial authority to pass upon these consti tutional questions but that it was its manifest duty to do so in so far as it was necessary to reach a final conclu sion This position of the Attorney General was not com batted by the learned counsel for the defendant company but was conceded to be correct Indeed it is no longer open to question In this Commonwealth the State Cor poration Commission created by constitutional authority is the instrumentatlity through which the State exercises its governmental powers for the regulation and control of public service corporations For these purposes it has been clothed with legislative judicial and executive pow ers Was held by the Court of Appeals of this State in the case of Norfolk  P R R Company v Com 103 Va 289 which went up to that court on appeal from the Com mission Of course this question is therefore no longer an open one in this State and it might have been wiser if the paper con testing the right of the Commission to pass upon the constitu tionality of an act should have consulted its legal editor before calling into question this power of the Commission Of course this decision of the Commission is not final being subject to review bv the Supreme Court of Appeals but its power in the premises is unquestioned Occasionally across the solemn pronouncements of the Su preme Court of the United States there comes a flash of humor in most cases unintentional More WarAnticipation than once that great jurist Mr Justice ofJustification Holmes has given us an opportunity to for Breach of indulge in a most respectful smile In Shipping Contract the case of North German Lloyd v Guarantee Trust Company U S S C Advance Opinions for 1916 page 490 in deciding that the Kronprinzessin Cecilie was justified in turning back when notified by wireless that war was imminent between England 210  Julyand Germany the Justice says And when we add to the seizure of the vessel the possible detention of the German ant some of the other passengers the proposition is doubly clear Cases deciding what is and what is not within the risk of an insurance policy throw little light upon the standard of con duct to be applied in a case like this But we see no ground to doubt that Chief Justice Marshall and Chief Justice Kent would have concurred in the views that we express We were never aware before that Mr Justice Kent was ever Chief Jus ticecertainly in that sense used in a Supreme Court opinion and we must confess that we could not restrain a slight smile at the calm certainty on which Mr Justice Holmes rests his belief that the great Chief Justice of his Court and the great Chief Justice of New York would have concurred with him in the case at bar It will be remembered that this was the case in which the Kronprinzessin Cecilie was sued for failure to deliver certain kegs of gold at Plymouth and Cherbourg on the eve of the outbreak of the present war When the ship was vithin a thousand miles of Plymouth her master received a wireless message from the directors saying that war had broken out between England France and Russia although war with England was not declared until five days later On August 1st the master also received a message of the threatening danger of war and so he turned back to America and redelivered the gold The lower court gave a verdict for damages but the Supreme Court Justices Pitney and Clark dissenting held that the master was justified although he might have delivered the gold and escaped capture by the margin of a few hours 1917  211 EDITORIAL

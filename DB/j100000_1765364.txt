of water used as lemonade  the water previously boiled and observe if sour wines might not be better for those in the habit of drinking liquors also as to whether gout and rheu matism which are acid diatheses conferred immunity S V CLEVENGER MD Chicago Sept 5 Mars AT the present time while theories and suggestions concerning the planet Mars are in order it imight be well to note that on a study of Schiaparellis chart of Mars the systems of socalled canals resolve themselves in many cases into radiating groups of six miaking hexagons and giving the idea that the planet may be solidified into a mass with teniency to hexagonal crystallization the  canals  being for instance fissures on the lines of the angles of crystallization This would account for many of the peculiari ties of their appearance while in no way opposing the present existence of atmosphere water snow ice and vegetation on the planet C W KEMPTON Oro Blanco Ariz Aug 25 La Grippe THE name La Grippe as used to designate the influenza which was epidemic over so large a part of the world luring the past two or three years seems to have had a curious origin Dr Grant in an essay on the disease published in 1782 states that the French term La Grippe is derived from an insect of that name remarkably common in France during the previous spring and which the people believed contaminated the atmosphere and caused the disease If this be true what insect was it M L HOLBROOK New York Aug 29 VOL XX No 501 BOOKREVIEWS A Journal of American Ethnology and Archceology Editor J WALTER FEWKES Vol II Boston Houghton Mifflin

Natal Ceremonies of the Hopi Indians by J G Owens III A Report on the Present Condition of a Ruin in Arizona Called Casa Grande also by Dr Fewkes Dr Fewkes the editor of the journal and the author of two of the contributions to this volume has treated the subject of the Tusayan ceremonials with much greater success than were treated the Zunfii rites to which he devoted much of the first volume The province of Tusayan or socalled group of Moki Indian pueblos of northeastern Arizona owing to their remoteness from the demoralizing influence of the whitemans civilization are among the most primitive of our aboriginal tribes and Dr Fewkes has made no mistake in abandoning the Zufii field to which he devoted his first fieldseason and to which the attention of such workers as Mr F H Cushing and Mrs M C Stevenson had earlier beenf drawn in order to apply all his energies to this interesting people So far as ethnologic investigation has proved the Tusayan group excluding the Tewa village of Hano is the only existing example of a nomadic people adopting a strictly pueblo life for the Mokis or Hopi are a part of the great Sho shonean stock cousins of the Utes the Snakes and the Coman ches and who centuries ago were disconnected from the main family and forced to these mesa fastnesses where they erected communal structures of stone and mud and cultivated corn squashes cotton

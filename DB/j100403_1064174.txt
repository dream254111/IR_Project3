ad missible in mitigation of damages Rogers v Toliver 139 Ga 281 77 S E 28 Ann Cas 1914A 1017 HUSBAND AND WIFEFRAUDULENT CONVEYANCESBURDEN OF PROOFA deed from a third person conveying land to the wife of an insolvent husband was unrecorded The creditors of the insolvent husband sought to have the conveyance set aside as fraudulent Held the bur den of proving fraud is on the creditors Southern States Phosphate  Fertilizer Co v Weekly S C 93 S E 190 For a discussion of the principle involved see full and excellent ar ticle by Mr Bolling H Handy 4 VA LAW REv 208 INTERSTATE COMMERCETELEGRAPHSVALIDITY OF CONDITIONS LIMITING LIABILITYThe defendant received a message at its office in Ohio to be transmitted by telegraph to the plaintiff in Missouri This telegram although unrepeated was correctly transmitted but through the neg ligence of the telegraph company it was not delivered until eleven days after the date of sending whereby the plaintiff sustained a loss of certain fees and his position On the back of the telegraph blank on which the message was written were the usual conditions limiting liability for mistakes or nondelivery of an unrepeated message to the charge of sending and placing fifty dollars as the maximum recovery in any case unless the sender in writing placed a higher value of the message Held the plaintiff is entitled to recover fifty dollars Ja cobs v Western Union Telegraph Co Mo 196 S W 31 The Federal Interstate Commerce Act as amended by the Hepburn Act and the Carmack Amendment declares telegraph companies do ing business between States to be common carriers within the meaning of that act Interstate telegrams are therefore governed by the fed eral law as laid down by the federal courts to the exclusion of all state statutes and decisions Poor v Western Union Telg Co Mo 196 S W 28 Brown v Western Union Telg Co 234U S 542 It is a well settled doctrine in the United States that the sendee of a telegram has a right of action against the company for negligent mistake or non delivery Fererro v Western Union Telg Co D C 35 L R A 548 But the claim must be presented within a reasonable time Russell v Western Union Telg Co 17 Kan 230 45 Pac 598 There is much dis pute among the state courts regarding the ground upon which this ac tion should be based Some base it upon the breach of public duty owed by the telegraph company to correctly transmit and deliver all messages Westert Union Telg Co v Dubois 128 Ill 248 Others base the claim on the contract between the company and the sender West ern Union Telg Co v Holder 117 Ark 210 174 S W 552 The federal rule seems to be that the sendee cannot recover in an action of tort The contract made with the sender is said to enure to the benefit of the sendee Sherril v Western Union Tel Co N C 14 S E 94 This rule does not recognize any principle of public policy 74RECENT DECISIONS whereby the company owes the public generally the duty to correctly transmit and deliver all messageshence the sendee cannot bring an action for the breach of a duty which is not owed him But the contract as em bodied in the telegraph blank is binding upon the sendee and without this contract between the sender and the company the latter owed the sendee no duty and hence there could be no negligence for which a recovery could be had in absence of the contract Gardner v West ern Union Telg Co 231 Fed 405 Findlay v Western Union Telg Co C C 64 Fed 459 The reasonableness and validity of the conditions limiting the tele graph companys liability is not a question to be passed upon by the state or federal courts as this right is given to the Interstate Com merce Commission by Congress Williams v Western Union Telg Co 203 Fed 140 Gardner v Western Union Telg Co supra But even be fore telegraph companies had been declared common carriers the United States Supreme Court had declared these conditions to be valid and binding Primrose v Western Union Telg Co 154 U S 1 The reason given by the court in allowing the plaintiff 5000the maximum recovery allowed by the contract for a repeated message was that as no error was made in the transmission of the message it would not have prevented the injury if it had been repeated therefore it was considered as a repeated message LANDLORD AND TENANTTRMINATION ON NOTICEILLEGAL USE OF PREM ISESA storeroom was leased for a saloon and for no other pur poses and a provision in the lease stipulated that if it became unlaw ful to conduct a saloon therein the lessee might terminate the lease by giving proper notice Held provision enforcible Halloran v Jacob Schmidt Brewing Co Minn 162 N W 1082 In the absence of an express stipulation in a lease of property guard ing against a possible future prohibition law the courts are somewhat divided as to whether or not the lessee has an implied right to termi nate the lease upon the passage of a prohibition law Where prop erty was leased for a firstclass saloon and not to be used for any dis reputable business it was held that other legitimate businesses were not excluded and the lessee was liable on his contract San Antonio Brewing Assn v Brents 39 Tex Civ App 443 88 S W 368 And a les see was held liable upon the lease of property for a saloon and restau rant even though his right to conduct a saloon was taken away by an act of the legislature Standard Brewing Co v Weil Md 99 Atl 661 This is because the lessee should have contemplated the possible pas sage of a prohibition law and should have stipulated as to his rights in case of the happening of such a contingency Houston etc v Keenan 99 Tex 79 88 S W 197 Goodrum Tobacco Co v PottsThompson Liquor Co 133 Ga 776 66 S E 1081 On the other hand the lessee has been held not liable for breach even though the use of the property was not restricted to saloon purposes alone because the purpose of the con tract has become unlawful through no fault of the lessee Heart v East End Brewitg Co 121 Tenn

COMBINATION LAWS AS ILLUSTRATING THE RELATION BETWEEN LAW AND OPINION IN ENG LAND DURING THE NINETEENTH CENTURY1 J0 portion of English legislation exhibits in a more striking lN 5 light the close connection during the nineteenth century between the development of the law and the varying currents of public opinion than do the changes made from i8oo up to the present day in the combination law My aim in this article is to trace out this intimate connection For the due comprehension however of the matter in hand my readers must bear in mind three preliminary considerations First The term  combination law has to an English lawyer a peculiar and somewhat narrow significance The combination law as the expression is used in this article and generally by English judges and lawyers means the body of legal rules or principles which from time to time regulate the right of workmen on the one side to combine among themselves for the purpose of determining by agreement the terms on whichi and especially the rate of wages at which they will work or in other words sell their labour and the right of masters on the other side to combine among themselves for the purpose of de 1 See Wright Law of Criminal Conspiracies See Erle Trade Unions 3 Stephen Hist Crim Law 2062275I2 HAR VARD LA WV RE VIE W termining by agreement the terms on which and especially the rate of wages at which they will engage workmen or in other words purchase labour Secondly The combination law as thus described is merely one part of a far wider subject namely the legal rules regulating the exercise of a right which exists in every country but while under English law it has scarcely acqtuired a definite name is known on the Continent and notably in France as the right of association this right of association fuLrther is a right marked by certain special characteristics This right of association is nothing more than the right of two or more citizens X Y and Z to combine together by agreement among themselves for the attainment of a common purpose This purpose or end may be of no more intrinsic importance than the formation of a dining club It may be on the other hand as important as the formation of the Jacobin Club which became the real government of France but whether the end for which men combine be trivial or of overwhelming consequence wherever you have union there you have an exercise or a claim to exercise the right of association Now one peculiarity of this right is that it may be regarded from two different points of view It may be regarded as a mere extension of each citizens individual free dom that is of his right to manage his own affairs in his own way as long as he does not trench upon the legal rights of his neiahbours whence it apparently follows 1 that whatever course of action X or Y or Z may lawfully pursue when acting without agreement that course of action X Y and Z may all of them lawfully pursue when acting together under an agreement and this undoubtedly is in general tlhough not without considerable limitations the doctrine of English law if X Y and Z may each of them lawvfully advocate free trade or fair trade they may as suredly all of them together with a thousand more of their friends 1  The sole end for which mankinid are warranted individually or collectively in interferinig with the liberty of action of any of their numiiber is selfprotection The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community against his will is to prevent harm to others His own good either physi cal or moral is not a sufficient warrant    In the part which merely concerns him self his independence is of right absolute Mill On Liberty ed I859 21 22 Cf ibid 27 Every person has a right under the law as between him and his fellow subjects to full freedom in disposing of his own labour or his own capital according to his own will Erle Trade Unions I2THE COMBINVATION LAW AND OPINION 513 form an AntiCorn Law League or a Fair Trade League If X or Y or Z may each of them lawfully as is certainly the case cut A because of his hateful religious or political opinions they may all it would seem agree together to cut him Nor is it easy to main tain that they have not prima facie a right to advise or induce their friends to enter into a similar agreement and this line of reasoning suggests at any rate the result that a federation of em ployers may lawfully agree never to emiploy A though a good workman because he has taken a leading part in a strike and that a body of Trade Unionists may agree never to work together with nonunionists and especially not with a notorious blackleg B whom his former friends hold a traitor to the cause of Union ism Does not the same view make it lawful for a body of work men to agree that they will have no dealings with any factory where B is allowed to work or to carry the matter a step further with any employer or merchant who has any dealings with a fac tory where B is employed to work But this example brings us across a quite different and indeed opposite aspect of the right of association It may be looked upon as a right of a very peculiar character the exercise whereof leads to results which may con ceivably be injurious both to individuals and to the public When a body of twenty or two thousand or two hundred thousand men bind themselves together to act in a particular way for some com mon purpose they create a body which by no fiction of law but from the very nature of things differs from the individuals of whom it is constituted Esprit de corps is a real and powerful sen timent it drives men to act either above or still more often below the ordinary moral standard of their conduct as individuals What at any rate is certain is that a body created by combination whether a political league a church or a trade union limits in some degree the freedom of its members Its power is created by the surrender of individual liberty on the part of each of its asso ciates and a society may from this surrender acquire far greater strength than could be exercised by the whole of its members act ing separately a disciplined regiment acting under command is a far more formidable assailant than a thousand men who even though armed act without discipline or combination Note here this further result an association not only limits the freedom of its members but threatens to cut short and indeed of necessity does cut short the individual freedom of persons who stand outside the associated body Who can doubt that private citizens have often 33514 HARVARD LAW REVIEW found it morally impossible to resist the commands of a political association or of a powerful church Can it be seriously main tained that a workman preserves full freedom of action when he knows that if he takes part in a strike he may ultimately be de prived of employmnent by the authority of a federation of employ ers Has a workman on the other hand the liberty which the law ought to secure to every orderly citizen if he knows that the refusal to join a union may make it impossible for him to obtain employment throughout the length and breadth of the United Kingdom and also it may be should the trade unionists of Eng land and the trade unionists of America enter into a tacit alliance tlhroughout the length and breadth of the United States Hence the right of association has a paradoxical character a right which from one point of view seems to be a necessary extension of indi vidual freedom is from another point of view fatal to that individual freedom of which it seems to be a mere extension Thirdly This paradox raises a problem which at this moment in all civilized countries perplexes moralists and thinkers no less than legislators and judges How is the right of association to be reconciled with each mans individual freedom Curtail the right of association and personal liberty loses half its value Give to the right of association unlimited scope and you destroy not the mere value but the existence of personal freedom The problem takes different shapes in different countries In France it appears as a question of religious freedom In the United States it excites and complicates the agitation against trusts In Ireland it disturbs the whole relation between land lord and tenant and compels the inquiry how far a boycott is a criminal conspiracy or whether boycotting can be defended under the specious alias of exclusive dealing In England the limits of the right of association have hitherto been considered mainly and indeed too exclusively in reference to trade combinations either among workmen or employers the alterations in the com bination law will be found to be a series of attempts to solve the problem raised by the right of association and to adjust a conflict of rights2 namely the right of X Y and Z to combine I At this moment 20 April 1904 it threatens at Limerick to take the form of a question as hateful as it is dangerous whether traders are tobe denied the rights of other British citizzns because they adhere to their inherited Judaism 2 Such a conflict of rights may easily arise without any relation to the right of asso ciation The law of libel and slander for instance is nothing but a rough attempt to maintain on the one hand Xs right to what is popularly though inaccurately calledTHE COMBINATION LA W ANAD OPINION 515 freely together for any purpose not definitely illegal and the right on the other hand of every individual A not to be deprived by the concerted action of X Y and Z of that right to manage his own affairs in his own way which English law treats as the very essence of personal freedom The changes in the combination law are then attempts to fix the limits of the right of association in regard to trade disputes and may be brought under four heads which are the Tory legisla tion of i800 the Benthamite reform of I82425 the compromise of I875 represented by the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act i875 the judicial interpretation of that Act i890i904 Each of these changes bears a different character each accurately corresponds with the opinion of the time when it took place A The combination law of i8oo The Combination Act i8oo 40 Geo 3 c io61 aimed in reality at one object namely the suppression of all combinations of workmen whether transitory or permanent of which the object was to obtain an advance of wages or otherwise fix the terms of employment It was really an act for the suppression of strikes anid of trade unions The severity of the statute can be realised only by a minute study of its differ ent provisions to enter inlto wlhich would be alien to my present purpose Two illustrations may suffice Under the Act it is made an offense to put the matter shortly to assist in maintaining men on strike 2 persons guilty of this or any other offense under the Act are made liable to conviction on summary procedure before justices of the peace3 freedom of speech or freedom of opinion and at the same time to protect As right not to be damaged by the false or reckless statements of X This example deserves niotice because after about a century of legislationi the law of libel has resulted in a roughly satisfactory adjustment of rights constantly tending to come into conflict TFhis fact gives some reason to hope for an ultimate adjustment of the conflict between the right of association and the right to individual freedom of action 1 It reenacts in substance the

a jury see for the reasons in favour of this sunmmary juris diction Report of Committee on Combination Laws I875 pp I0 It The desira bility of obtaininig a ready method for the punishmenit of trade offenses which could only be effected by Act of Parliament should be noted It invalidates the argument that conduct made an offense under eg the Combination Act i8oo could not be an offense at common law since if punishable at common law it would not have been made an offense by statute516 HARVARD LAW REVIEW One feature of the great Combination Act is sometimes because of its small practical importance overlooked The statute imposes a penalty upon combinations amonig masters for the reduction of wages or for an inicrease in the hours or the quantity of work To an historian of opinion this provision is of importance It shows that in i8oo Parliament was in theory opposed to every kind of trade combination Behind the Combination Act  and this is a matter for my pur pose of primary importance there stood the law of conspiracy1 As to the exact nature of this law as then understood it would be rash to express ones self with dogmatic confidence There are one or two features however of that law as it stood in i8oo of which it may be allowable to write with a certain degree of confidence First The law of conspiracy had by the end of the eighteenth century received under judicial decisions a very wide extension2 Secondly A conspiracy it is submitted included in i8oo a combination for any of the following purposes that is to say i For the purpose of committing a crime3 2 For the purpose of violating a private right in which the public has a sufficient interest 4 i e semble for the purpose of committing any tort or breach of contract which materially affects the interest of the public5 1 Sir William Erle Sir Robert S Wright Sir J F Stephen all of them judges have each published on this subject books of authority A study of their writings leaves on my mind the impression that these eminent authors have each arrived at some what different conclusions and that they each felt the law of conspiracy to be obscure 2 Wrights worknot republished since he was raised to the bench contains elaborate arguments to show that this extension was illegitimate and was not really supported by the authorities on which it is supposed to rest From a merely histori cal point of view these arguments are of great force but from a legal point of view their effect is diminished by the reflection that similar arguments if employed by a lawyer of as much historical information and of as keen logical acumen as Sir R S Wright would shake almost every accepted principle of English law in so far as it does not depend upon statute In any case Wrights arguments are for my present purpose irrelevant my object is to state as far as may be not what the law of con spiracy ought to have been but what it was in igoo 3  It is undisputed law that a combination for the purpose of committing a crime is a crime  Erle 31 and this whether the crime is known to the common law or is created by statute 4 Erle 32 5 It is arguable in spite of Turners Case 13 East 228 that a combination to commit any tort or for the breach of any contract with a view to damage any person is a con spiracy but it is not necessary for our purpose to state the law as widely as this See Kenny Outlines of Crim Law 288290THE COMBINA TION LAW AND OPIiVION 517 3 For any purpose clearly opposed to received morality or to rablic policy Thirdly Since a combination to commit a crime is ipso facto a conspiracy it follows that a combination for any purpose made or declared criminal by the Comnbination Act I8oo eg a combina tion to collect money for the support of men on strike was in i8oo an undoubted conspiracy If we bear these features of the law of conspiracy in mind and recollect that the Combination Act was not intended to render unlawful any bargaining eg as to the rate of wages between an emiployer and an individual workman the combined result of the Combination Act in i8oo and the law of conspiracy or in other words of the combination law as it stood at the beginning of the nineteenth century may be thus broadly summed up Any artisan who organized a strike or joined a trade union was a criminal and liable on conviction to imprisonment The strike was a crime the trade union was ani unlawful association The whole idea on which the law rested was this Workmen are to be contented with the current rate of wages and are on no account to do anything which has a tendency to compel their emn ployers to raise it Practically they could go where they pleased individu ally and make the best bargains they could for themselves but under no circumstances and by no means direct or indirect must they bring the pressure of numbers to bear on their employers or on each other 2 To a reader of the twentieth century this state of the law seems no less incomprehensible than intolerable and indeed within twenty I Erle 33 34 The agreements which at the present day may be held to constitute a conspiracy have beeni thus summarized i Agreements to commit a substantive crime R v Davitt iI Cox 676 R v Whitchurch 24 Q B D 420 eg a conspiracy to steal or to incite some one to steal 2 Agreements to commit any tort that is malicious 3 Agreements to commit a breach of contract under circumstances which are peculiarly inijurious to the public 4 Agreements to do certain other acts which unlike those hitherto mentioned are not breaches of law at all but which nevertheless are outrageously immoral or else in some way extremely injurious to the public See Kenny Outlines of Crim Law 288290 The definition attributed to Lord Denman of a conspiracy as a combination for accomplishinig an unlawful end or a lawful end by unlawful means see Wright 63 is it is submitted sound though too vague to be of much use Its importance lies in the emphasis it lays on the object or purpose a very different thing from the motive  of a combination as a test of its criminial character and in the light which it throws on the wide extension given by the law to the idea of conspiracy 2 3 Steph Hist 209518 HARVARD LAW REVIEW five years after the passing of the Combination Act appeared utterly indefensible to so rigid an economist as McCullock a man whose good sense and genuine humanity have been concealed from a later generation by the heavy and brutal satire of Carlyle Who we ask were the tyrants who deprived workingmen of all freedom and what was the state of opinion which sanctioned this tyranny The answer is that the men who passed the great Com bination Act were not despots and that the Act precisely corre sponded with the predominant beliefs of the time The Parliament of i8oo acted under the guidance of Pitt It contained among its members Fox and Wilberforce it was cer tainly not an assembly insensible to feelings of humanity The ideas of the working classes were it may be said not represented This is roughly true but artisans were no better represented in the Parliament of 1824 than in the Parliament of i8oo yet the Parlia ment of 1824 repealed the Combination Act and freed trade com binations from the operation of the law of conspiracy The mere fact which appears well ascertained that the Combination Act of 1799 and the Combination Act of i8oo which reenacted its provisions passed through Parliament witlhout any discussion of which a report remains is all but decisive The law of the day represented in i8oo the predominant opinion of the day The public opinion wvhich sanctioned the Combiniation Act which was to a great extent a Consolidation Act consisted of two elements The first element though not in the long run the more impor tant was a dread of combinations due in the main to the then recent memories of the Reign of Terror Does later experience enable us to say that this fear was then a mere unfounded panic Englishmen at any rate who though from a distance had witnessed the despotism of the Jacobin Club wlhich it is said towards the close of its tyranny sent weekly in Paris alone some hundreds of citizens to the guillotine may be excused for some jealousy of clubs or unions The existence at any rate of this fear of combi nations is certaini it is proved by a body of acts  37 Geo 3 C 123 I797 39 Geo 3 c 69 I799 57 Geo 3 c I9 1817 which were directed against any treasonable or seditious society or against any society which might turn out to foster treason or 1 L e the Combination Act generalized provisions which had been long enforced under special Acts in respect of workmen engaged in particular kinds of manufactures See 3 Steph Hist 206THE COMBINATION LA W AND OPINION 519 sedition The presence in these enactments of provisions in fa vour of Freemasons Quakers and CharitiesI betrays the width of their operation and the fears of their authors Clubs of all kinds were objects of terror The second element of public opinion in i8oo was the tradition of paternal government which had been inherited from an earlier age and was specially congenial to the Toryism of the day This tradition had two sides The one was the conviction that it was the duty of labourers to work for reasonable that is to say for customary wages The other side of the same tradition was the provision by the state at the cost be it noted of the welltodo classes and especially of the landowners of subsistence for work men who could not find work The socalled Speenhamland Act of Parliament by which the Justices of Berkshire granted to workingmen relief in proportion to the number of their families or to use the political slang of today tried to provide for them a  living wage is the fruit of the same policy which gave birth to the Cornbination Act i 800 The sentiment of the day was indeed curiously tolerant of a sort of crude socialism Whitbread intro duced a bill authorizing justices to fix a minimum of wages and complained of the absence of any law to compel farmers to do their duty Fox thought that magistrates should protect the poor from the injustice of grasping employers Pitt introduced a bill for authorizingr allowances ouit of the public rates including the present of a cow Burke approved a plan for enabling the  poor to purchase terminable annuities on the security of the rates2 The Combination Act then of i800 represented the public opinion of i8oo B The Benthamite reform3 In I824 was passed 5 Geo 4 c 95 which placed the whole combination law on a new basis Its provisions have thus been summarized by Sir Robert Wright In I824 the Act of 5 Geo 4 c 95 repealed all the then existing Acts relating to combinations of workmen and provided that workmen should not by reason of comibinations as to hours wages or conditions of labour or for inducing others to refuse work or to depart from work or for regulating tlhe mode of carrying on any manufacture trade or business or the management thereof be liable to any criminal proceeding or pun 1 Wright 23 24 2 Fowle Poor Law 66 67 8 The Combination Act I824 5 Geo 4 c 95 and the Combination Act I825 6 Geo 4 c I29 See 3 Steph Hist 221 Wright 13520 HARVARD LAW REVIEW ishment for conspiracy or otherwise under the statute or common law By another section it extended a similar immunity to combinations of masters On the otlher hand it enacted a penalty of two months imprisonment for violence threats intimidation and malicious mischief 1 This Act was repealed after a years trial and was replaced by the Combination Act I825 6 Geo 4 C I29 which also has been thus summarized by Wright  This Act again repealed the older statutes but without mention of common law It provided summary penalties for the use of violence threats intimidation molestationi or obstruction by any person for the purpose of forcing a master to alter his mode of business or a workman to refuise or leave work or of forcing any person to belong or subscribe or to conform to the rules of any club or association It did niot ex pressly penalize any combination or conspiracy and it exempted from all liability to punishment the mere meeting of masters or workmen for settling the conditions as to wages and hours on which the persolns preselnt at the meeting would consent to employ or serve 2 Even a trained lawyer may fail at first sight to perceive wherein lies the difference between the two Acts or to conjecture why the one was substituted for the other yet it will be found that the simni larity and the difference between the two enactments are equally important and that whilst the repeal of the earlier Act is per fectly explainable the singular course of legislation in I824 and I825 is the exact reflection of the current of opinion Each point merits separate consideration As to the points of simnilarity Both Acts aim at the same object they both reverse the policy of i8oo and are intended to establish free trade in labour they both as a part of such freedom of trade concede to men and to masters alike the right to discuss and agree together as to the terms on which they will sell or purchase labour both give expression to the idea that the sale or purchase of labour slhould be as entirely a matter of free contract as the purchase of boots and shoes Both Acts therefore repeal the great Combination Act and all earlier legislation against trade combinations Both Acts lastly impose severe penalties on the use of violence threats or intimidation whereby the contractual freedom of an individual workman or an individual nmaster may be curtailed and both Acts provide the machinery whereby these penalties may be summarily enforced The labour contract under I Wright I3 2 Wright I3THE COMBINATION LAW AND OPINION 521 each Act is intended to be perfectly and strictly free Combinations to raise or lower wages and the like are no longer forbidden but neither individuals nor combinations are to interfere with the riglht of each person freely to enter into any labour contract which may suit the contracting parties As to tMe difference The Act of I824 allows freedom of com bination for trade purposes both to men and to masters in the very widest terms1 and what is the matter specially to be noted ex empts trade combinations from the operation of the law of con spiracy It then imposes penalties upon the use of violenice threats or intimidation for certain definite purposes eg the compelling a workman to depart from his work The Combination Act I825 on the other hand in the first place imposes penalties upon the use of violence threats or intimidation for almost any purpose which could conceivably interfere with individual freedom of contract on the part of an individual work man or with the right of a master to manage his business in the way he thought fit The Act in the next place confers indirectly2 1 Sect 2 exempts from liability  to any indictment or prosecution for conspiracy or to any other criminal information or punishment whatever under the common or the statute law  journeymen workmen or other persons who shall enter into any com bination to obtain an advaance or to fix the rate of wages or to lessen or alter the hours or duration of the time of working or to decrease the quantity of work or to induce another to depart from his service before the end of the time or the term for which he is hired or to quit or return his work before the same shall be finished or not being hired to refuse to enter into work or employment or to regulate the mode of carrying on any manufacture trade or business or the managemelnt thereof Under this section a combination of X Y and Z to indtuce a workman to break a con tract of work or to induce a master to dismiss all workmen who were not trade union ists would semble not have been a conspiracy Sect 3 gives an analogous exemption to masters 2 Sect 4  Provided always    that this Act shall not extend to subject any per sons to punishment who shall meet together for the sole purpose of consulting upon and determining the rate of wages or prices which the persons present at such meeting or any of them shall require or demand for his or their work or the hours or time for which he or they shall work in any manufacture trade or business or who shall enter into any agreement verbal or written among themselves for the purpose of fixing the rate of wages or prices which the parties entering into such agreement or any of them shall require or demand for lhis or their work or the hours of time for which he or they will work in any manufacture trade or business and that persons so meeting for the purposes aforesaid or entering into any such agreement as afore said shall not be liable to any prosecution or penalty for so doing any law or statute to the contrary notwithstanding Section 5 provides an analogous exemption for meetings of masters to settle the rate of wages etc A comparison between the Act of 1824 section 2 and the Act of I825 section 3 shows that the liberty of combination allowed under the first Act is a good deal wider than that allowed under the second522 HARVARD LAW REVIEW upon workmen and masters a limited right to meet together and come to agreements for settling the rate of wages and the like which the persons present at the meeting will accept or give The Act lastly revives the law of conspiracy in regard to trade combinations The result therefore of the Combination Act I825 at any rate as interpreted by the courts was this Any trade combination was a conspiracy unless it fell within the limited right of combination given by the Act of i8251 A strike though not necessarily a conspiracy certainly might be so and a trade union as being a combination in restraint of trade was at best a nonlawful society2 ie a society which though membership in it was not a crime yet could not claim the protection of the law The course of parliamentary legislation with regard to the com bination law in I824 and I825 was singular but in all its features it exactly represents the dominant opinion that is the Benthamite individualism of the day The Act of 1824 was the work of known Benthamites McCullock advocated its principles in the Edinburgh Review Joseph Hume brought it as a bill into Parliament the astuteness of Francis Place in whose hands Hulme was a puppet made it possible to pass into law a bill of which the full effect was not perceived either by its advocates or by its opponents The Act gives expression in the simplest and most direct form to two convictions preeminently character istic of the Benthamites and the political economists The one is the belief that trade in labour ought to be as free as any other kind of trade the other is the wellgrounded conviction that there ought to be one and the same law for men as for masters Adam Smith had some fifty years before pointed out that trade combina tions on the part of workmen were blamed and punished whilst trade combinations on the part of masters were neither punished nor indeed noticed3 Liberty and equality each of which repre sent the best aspect of laissez faire were the fundamental ideas embodied in the Act of I 824 1 This Act  left the common law of conspiracy in force against all combinations in restraint of trade the combinations exempted from penalty under ss 4 and 5 alone excepted Erle 58 This is it is submitted the right view of the law Contrast however 3 Stephen Hist 223 2 Farrer v Close i869 L R 4 Q B 602 8 See Wealth of Nations ch viii pp 97I02 6th ed 179ITHE COMBINATION LA W AND OPINION 523 Why then was the Act of I824 repealed and replaced by the Act of I825  Something  even a good deal  was due to accidental circum stances In spite of the sagacious advice of Francis Place wvork men who were unused to the riglht of combination used their newly acquired power with imprudence not to say unfairness A large number of strikes took place and these strikes were accom panied by violence and oppression The artisans of Glasgow  boycotted as we should now say and tried to ruin an unlpopu lar manufacturer The classes whose voices were heard in Parlia ment were panic struck and their alarm was not unreasonable Hence the demand for the repeal of the Combination Act 1824 Place after his manner attributes the success of this demand to the baseness of parliamentary statesmen to the bad faith of Huskisson and above all to the machinations of one politician who lied so openly so grossly so repeatedly and so shame lessly as to astonish even the critic who had always considered this individual a pitiful shuffling fellow 1 This pitiful shuiffling fellowwas the wellknown Sir Robert Peel2 He had at any rate as we might expect something which is worth hearing to urge in support of his conduct Peel has left on record the ground of his opposition to the Act of I 824 It is that  sufficient precautions were not taken in that Act    to prevent that species of an noyance which numbers can exercise towards individuals short of personial violence and actual threat but nearly as effectual for its object 3 Here we pass from the transitory circumstances of a particular year and touch the true if unperceived cause of the reaction against the Combination Act of I824 The right of combination which was meant to extend personal freedom was so used as to menace the personal freedom both of men and of masters By the legis lation of I824 Benthamites and economists that is enlightened individualists had extended the right of combination in order to enlarge the area of individual freedom by the Act of 1825 sincere individualists among whom Peel may assuredly be numbered lim ited the right of trade combination in order to preserve the con tractual freedom of workmen and of masters The men who passed the Act of I824 meant to establish free trade in labour they did 1 Life of F Place 236 2 Then Mr Peel 8 Peels Private Correspondence 379 London I89I524 HARVARD LAW REVIEW not mean to cut short the contractual capacity of persons who pre ferred not to join or resisted the policy of trade unions The two Acts which seem contradictory are in reality different applications of that laissez faire which was a vital article of the utilitarian creed the economists and Liberals who in I824 had begun to guide legislative opinion were the sincerest and most enthusiastic of indi vidualists It is hard for the men of I904 to realize how earnest eighty years ago was the faith of the best men in England in indi vidual energy and in the wisdom of leaving every one free to pursue his own course of action as long as he did not trench upon the like liberty or the rights of his fellows To such reformers oppression exercised by the state was not more detestable than oppression exercised by trade unions Place was a Benthamite fanatic His finest characteristic was passionate zeal for the interest of the working class whence he sprung He knew workmen well he had no love for employers Yet Place and we may be sture many wiser men with him believed and hoped that the repeal of the combination law of i8oo would put an end to trade unions  The combinations of the men are but defensive measures resorted to for the purpose of counteracting the offensive ones of their masters    when every man knew that he couild carry his labour to the highest bidder there would be less motive for those combinations which now exist and which exist because such combinations are the only means of redress that they have 1 So Place in I825 Eighteen years later thus writes Richard Cobden Depend upon it nothing can be got by fraternising with trade unions they are founded upon principles of brutal tyranny and monopoly I would rather live under a Dey of Algiers than a trades committee  2 In I850 Miss Martineau is well assured that the Act of I825 was a necessary and salutary measure  By this act i e the Combination Act 18251 combinations of masters and workmen to settle terms about wages and lhours of labour are made legal but combinations for controlling employers by moral violence were again put under the operation of the common law By this as much was done for the freedom and security of both parties as can be done by legislation which in this matter as in all others is an inferior safeguard to that of personal intelligence 8 1 Life of F Place p 217 and see furtber p 2I8 2 Cobdenl i Morley ch xiii p 299 8 I H Martineaus Thirty Years Peace ed I877 474THE COMBIZNATION LAW AND OPINION 525 What is of even more consequence the best and wisest of the judges who administered the law of England during the fifty years which followed I825 were thoroughly imbued with Benthamnite Liberalism They believed that the attempt of trade unions to raise the rate of wages was something like an attempt to oppose a law of nature They were convincedand here it is difficult to assert that they erred that trade unionism was opposed to indi vidual freedom that picketing for example was simply a form of intimidation and that though a strike might in theory be legal a strike could in practice hardly be carried out with effect without the employment of some form of intimidation either towards mas ters or nonunionists No judges have ever deserved or earned more respect than Erle and Bramwell yet Erle deliberately main tained that under the Act of I825 any combination might be a conspiracy that interfered with  the free course of trade whilst Bramwell enounced the doctrine that  the liberty of a mans mind and will to say how he shall bestow himself and his means his talents and his industry is as much a subject of the laws protec tion as that of his body His language is as wide as possible Generally speaking the way in which people have endeavoured to control the operation of the minds of men is by putting restraints on their bodies and therefore we have not so many instances in which the liberty of the mind is vindicated as that of the body Still if any set of men agreed amongst themselves to coerce that liberty of mind and tlhouglht by compulsion and restraint they would be guilty of a criminal offence namely that of conspiring against the liberty of mind and freedom of will of those towards whom they so conducted tlhemselves I am re ferring to coercion and compulsionsomething that is unpleasant and annoying to the minid operated upon and I lay it down as clear and undouibted law that if two or more persons agree that they will by such means cooperate together against that liberty they are guilty of an indict able offence Bramwells doctrine moreover laid down in 1867 harmonizes with that treatise of Mill  On Liberty which was the final and authoritative apology for the Benthamite faith in individual freedonm We may feel therefore assured that the legislation of I82425 was not intentionally unjust and represented even in its fluictuation the best and most liberal opinion of the time The individualism of I825 is open to one conmment individualists whether jurists or 1 R v Druitt 1867 Io Cox 6oo per Bramwell B cited 3 Steph Hist 221 222526 HARVARD LAW REVIEW economists had not then and indeed niever have fully recognised the characteristics of combined action In common with the revolutionary reformers of France they recognised as a fact the power of the state and the rights of individuals but they never studied the mode in whiCh individual action is modified when you consider men niot as isolated from their fellows but as members of society or of special societies They saw and saw truly that the need of the time was at any rate as regards trade to free workmen and masters from the trammels imposed by law on individual action They did not see the difficulty of reconciling individual freedom with the right of association they could not supply the solution of a problem whereof they hardly acknowledged the ex istence A few lines in Mill  On Liberty are all the reference he nmakes to the proper limits of combined action He and the school to which he belonged seemed to have held that when once the area of individual liberty was defined it was unnecessary to lay down any rules either of law or of morality for fostering or check ing the use of the power arising fromi combination In any case the doctrine both of Mill and of his teachers is uncertain and in distinct and indistinctness of belief always begets inconsistency of action The combination law of 1825 stood almost unaltered for fifty years The experiment of trying to establish free trade in labour was probably a wise one whether the Act of I825 ought to have been repealed may still admit of discussion Two things are certain Its provisions caused dissatisfaction and the Liberals of the day imbued in the main with Benthamite doctrine could provide no clear principle for its amendment C The compromise of 18751 Thlis compromise revolutionized the combination law It is marked by the following characteristics First No trade combination on the part either of employers or workmen to do any act which if committed by one person would not be punishable as a crime can since the passing of the Act of 1875 be indictable as a conspiracy2 Hence 1 The Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875 38  39 Vict c 86 the Trade Union Act 1871 34  35 Vict c 3I the Trade Union Act 1876 39  40 Vict c 22 2 An agreement or combination by two or more persons to do or procure to be done any act in contemplation or furtherance of a trade

Ist clause Contrast the language of the Combination Act 1824 5 Geo 4 c 95 s 2 enacting that any journeyman workman or other persons who enter toTHE COMBINATION LAW AND OPINION 527 Secondly A trade combination is placed in a different position from that occupied by combinations which are not trade combina tions for whilst a trade combination cannot be indictable as a conspiracy unless it is a combination to do an act which may be a crime if done by an individual acting alone a combination which is not a trade combination may be indictable as a conspiracy even though it is a combination to do an act which would not be a crime if done by an individual if acting alone X acting alone leaves the employment of a manufacturer A without due notice and in breach of his contract of service X does not commit a crime X Y and Z form a trade combination for the purpose of simultaneously leaving the employment of A without due notice and in breach of their contract of service The combination of X Y and Z is under the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act I875 not an indictable conspiracy X on the otherthand a tenant of a landlord A declines to pay his rent X has not committed a crime but at most a breach of contract X Y and Z tenants of A enter into a combination not to pay rent to A This combination which has no reference to a trade dispute and therefore does not fall within the Conspiracy and Pro tection of Property Act I875 is or may be indictable as a criminal conspiracy Thirdly Trade unions which under the Combination Act 1825 were at best nonlawful societies as being in restraint of trade are under the Trade Unions Act I87I and 1876 not to be held unlaw ful societies on the miiere ground that their purposes are in restraint of trade A trade union in short isprimafacie a lawful society though of course it may like any other association become an un lawful society if it is formed for or pursues unlawful objects Per sons therefore whether trade union officials or others who defraud a union eg embezzle its funds are punishable like any other persons guilty of embezzlement but though trade unions are lawful socie ties trade union contracts that is agreements between the members of a trade union or between two trade unions are in general not directly enforceable by law2 put the matter shortly into any trade combination  shall not therefore be subject or liable to any inidictment or prosecution for conspiracy or to any other criminal infor mation or punishment whatever under the common or the statute law 1 Trade Union Act I871 ss 2 3 2 See Trade Union Act I871 S 4 To put the matter broadly the trade union is a lawful club but a club of whiclh the528 HARVARD LA W REVIEW Fourthly Any person guilty of intimidation or annoyance to any other person eg a fellow workman with a view to interfering with such workmans legal freedom of action or who with this view does certain specific injuries to such other workman eg besets his dwellinghouse is guilty of an offense punishable with imprisonment whence it follows that a combination to commit such offense or crime is a conspiracy but  picketing  I pur posely use popular not technical languare  is in reality more or less legalised as long as it is moderate picketing which does not amount to intimidation The general character of the compromise of i875 is unmistak able It constitutes a modificationi of the combination law which is greatly in favour of workmen at any rate in so far as they are trade unionists The policy of I8oo is distinctly reversed In i8oo trade combinations whether temporary combinations such as strikes or permanent combinations such as trade unions were regarded by the law with the gravest disfavour It is extremely doubtful whether any one who participated in such combinations could avoid committing a crime In 1875 trade combinations are greatly favoured by the law they are not indictable as conspira cies in cases in wlhich other combinations may be indictable as conspiracies Trade unions though not made corporate bodies are lawful societies The compromise further is from the point of view of trade unionists a great advance on the combination law of I825 In I825 the liberty given to trade combinations was extremely limited and severe penalties were imposed on every kind of intimidation of which workmen on strike or trade unions might conceivably beguilty Under the compromise of I875 free dom of combination is extended further than even underthe Act of i8241 and only a limited number of definite acts remain pun ishable under the head of intimidation But the compromise though favourable to trade unionists is a compromise The legis lature has clearly intended to provide for the protection of indi viduals whether masters or workmen whose legal liberty of action might be infringed by trade combinations and the effect of the compromise was in I875 on some points open to doubt A study of the Act of I875 and the other enactments with which it ought to be read as well as the known facts of history courts will not directly enforce the rules e g as to payment of subscriptions and the like as against any member 1 See ante p 521 n ITHE COMBINATION LAW AND OPINION 529 easily explain the state of opinion which gave birth to the com promise of 1875 The Benthamite reform of I825 was domi nated throughout by the desire of the Benthamite reformers who were stringenit individuialists to protect at all costs every indi viduals contractual capacity The Act moreover of 1825 had been interpreted by magistrates who were themselves individu alists and who following the guidance of Parliament used the law of conspiracy to check combinations which aimed at purposes in restraint of trade and moreover to protect individual freedom of action Hence for fifty years a conflict between the law as ex pounded by the courts and the habits and wishes of trade union ists The judges held that though a strike in itself might be legal a strike almost inevitably led to acts which were criminal Trade unionists on the other hand who at one time I83250 accepted in name at least the doctrine of laissez faire interpreted it as allowing unlimited freedom of combination for any objects which were not distinctly criminal and held that if a strike was legal conduct such as picketing necessary to the maintenance of a strike could not be a crime By I875 two changes had taken place the force of individualism had declined and in many branches of the law could be traced the rising authority of col lectivism Meanwhile the artisans had obtained the parliamen tary franchise and there existed among Liberals and also among Conservatives a tendency to overrate the wisdom and the virtues of workingmen Hence the ideas of trade unionists which in I86i were utterly unrepresented in a middleclass Parliamentl received at least the attention which was their due in the more or less democratic Parliament of I875 The old ideas however con genial to individualism and inherited from the reformers of I832 were still potent No English Parliament was prepared to leave individual freedom unprotected against combined numbers This was a condition of opinion which naturally produced a compro mise and a compromise favourable on the whole to working men and such favour was the more natural because in England at any rate trade union leaders had on the whole exercised their power with moderation D The judicial interpretation of the compromise The legris lation of I875 left many questions open What was the true position of a trade union What were the principles on whiclh 1 Mill Rep Gov 56 57 34530 HAR VARD LA W REVIEW to determine whether a combinationl of any kind was a conspiracy at common law Could an individual who suffered damage through a trade combination recover damages in an action where under the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act I875 the combination was not indictable as a conspiracy These and other inquiries of the same sort were left to the de cisioIl of the courts Trade unionists and many lawyers believed that they must all be answered in the way most favourable to the free action of the unions Since 1885 however cases requir ing the interpretation of the compromise of i875 have come frequently before the courts The exact effect of the judgments delivered is in some degree a subject of dispute The following principles however may it is submitted be deduced from decided cases i An act lawful in itself is not by the mere existence of a bad motive converted into an unlawful act so as to render the doer thereof liable to an action by a person who suffers damage from such act1 But note that the motive influencing the doer of an act is in itself a totally different thing though often confounded with the purpose or object for the attainment of which he does the act 2 Acts which are not in themselves unlawful when done by persons acting in combination solely with the lawful object of protecting their trade and increasing their profits are not actionable2 3 A combination of X Y and Z to do an act which if done by X alone would not be either criminal or wrongful may be a conspiracy8 4 A combination of X Y and Z to break or to cause others to break a contract with A or semble to induce others not to enter into contracts with A is in the absence of distinct legal justi fication a conspiracy and gives A if damaged thereby a cause of action4 1 Allen v Flood 1898 A C i Quinn v Leathem I9OI A C 495 Stevenson v Newnham 1853 I3 C B 297 2 Mogul Steamship Co v McGregor 1892

to say of X Y and Z which is not indictable as a conspiracy may yet if it damages A give A a right of action1 6 A registered and probably an unregistered trade union is liable to be sued for torts committed by its agents and also it would seem is competent to sue as a plaintiff The interpretation put by the courts on the compromise of 1875 is it is submitted from a legal point of view thoroughly sound and will commend itself to men of whatever party who still hold that personal liberty is the basis of national welfare But this interpretation does undoubtedly deprive trade unionists of advantages which in common with many lawyers they believed that they had obtained under the Act of I875 It is now at any rate abundantly clear that neither trade unions nor any other associations can under English law possess property without incur ring that liability to pay damages for wrongs done by themselves or by their agents which attaches to all property holders In a sense therefore the interpretation put by the courts upon the Act of I875 and other enactments connected with it does mark a reaction not against the provisions of that Act but against the tendency so to construe them as to confer upon trade unions a position of privilege The causes of this reaction are to be found in the current of opinion and indeed might be all summed uip in the existence of the one word  boycott The term which has obtained a worldwide acceptance came into being duLring the autumn of i8802 It spread far and wide because it supplied a new name for an old social dis ease which had reappeared in a new and most dangerous form It bore witness to the pressing peril that freedom of combination might if unrestrained give a deathblow to individual liberty The results then of our survey canl be thus sunmmed up The combination law has from the end of the eighteenth century precisely corresponded with the course of opinion The Combination Act i8oo represents the panicstricken but paternal Toryism of that date The Combination Acts 1824 1825 even in their singular fluc 1 Quinn v Leathem supra Glamorgan Coal Co v South Wales Miners Fed 19031 2 K B C A 505 Giblan v National etc Union 1903 2 K B C

combined influence of democracy and collectivism The interpretation of that compromise by the courts represents the belief still strong in England in the sacredness of individual liberty and the sense of the peril to which personal liberty is exposed by an unrestricted right of combination The very confusion of the present state of the law corresponds with and illustrates a confused state of opinion We all of us in England still fancy at least that we believe in the blessings of freedom yet to quote an expression which has become pro verbial  today we are all of us socialists The

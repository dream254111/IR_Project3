As alternate methods the procedure of Morse and Piggot or the lactocrite may be used In the method of Morse the milk is dried by treatment with anhydrous sulphate of copper and the fat extracted with light petroleum Afterwards it is esti mated volumetrically by saponification with standard alkali In the method by the lactocrite the fat is separated in a centrifugal machine revolving at the rate of 7000 turns per minute the milk being pre viously treated with an equal volume of a mixture of I part sulphuric and 20 parts acetic acid The method for analysis of fertilizers with a few slight changes remains as last year The most important contribution in this mat ter was from Prof M A Scovel of Kentucky who showed that fertilizers containing nitrates could be treated by the Kjeldahl pro cess if the sulphuric acid used in digestion contained a certain por tion of salycilic acid By this means the total nitrogen existing in the three forms can be determined by an extremely simple and easy process The meeting was largely attended and full of practical interest from beginning to end Two new committees viz one on fer mented liquors and the other on sugar analysis were appointed The

IT is strange that so little is known in the United States about Alaska It has been a possession of our government for twenty years and even now interest in it is only beginning to be developed Yet in it we have by far the most remarkable of all our territories Its area is not less than 6ooooo square miles or onefifth of that of the United States proper It is equal in extent to all the New Eng land states all the middle states Ohio Indiana Michigan the Vir ginias the Carolinas Tennessee Kentucky and Mississippi Sitka is as far from the parallel of the extreme western boundary of Alas ka as it is from the parallel of Eastport Me The present governor of the territory estimates its population to be 3526I including whites creoles and natives Of this number io6oo including 3 100oo whites dwell in southeastern Alaska the part accessible to tourists The native race of southeastern Alaska is the Thlinket The Thlinkets are far superior intellectually and industrially to the North American Indian They are variously said to be of Asiatic and Aztec origin but the majority of observers believe them to be related to the Chinese They are skilful workers in wood and metals shrewd traders and very amenable to civilizing influences The climate of southeastern Alaska is any thing but Arctic The observations of Sergeant John J McLean of the Signal Service at Sitka for the year ending Aug 3I I886 showed an average temperature of 44Q8 F The maximum was 72 reached both in July and August and the minimum 4 reached in January The rainfall is very heavy often being more than IOO inches per annum Alaskas resources are timber mining furs and fisheries but as they are only just being measured it is useless to quote figures con cerning them The trip to Wrangell Juneau Sitka and the great glaciers of southeastern Alaska is now easily and quickly made by frequent steamers from the Puget Sound ports During the summer season there are weekly sailings and the fastest steamer makes the round trip from Tacoma WT in eleven days Travellers should pro vide themselves with warm clothing for it will be needed during the entire trip Rubber boots or overshoes a rubber coat and a stout pair of walkingboots are desirable The lastmentioned are necessary for climbing on the Davidson and Muir glaciers and the rubber articles are a protection against the wet weather For maps of the coast the British Coast Survey maps are to be recommended and the Coast Pilot is a most valuable aid in de termining the various peaks glaciers and channels Though numerous books on Alaska have been issued no one of them is satisfactory Lieutenant Schwatkas book does not treat of south eastern Alaska and those that profess to do so are superficial and inexact Hubert Howe Bancrofts History of Alaska is impor tant but far from satisfactory Adequate educational provision for the native and white children has yet to made The Thlinkets show great ability in industrial work and it is a source of great satisfaction to hear that an organ ized course of industrial training is to be put in operation in the Sitka school at once In the Circular of Information of the Bureau of Education known as No 2 I882 will be found an inter esting paper on  The Neglect of Education in Alaska B N Sitka Alaska Aug i HEALTH MATTERS AGAINST BERGEONS TREATMENT  Dr Townsend and Dr Hennessy report in the Albany Medical Annals nine cases of phthisis treated by gaseous enemata after Bergeons method The reporters say that these cases though few in number and some what incomplete are deemed worthy of publication as showing that this method of treatment seems as much of a failure in this dreaded malady as are others equally highly advocated at the pres ent day Besides these cases four others have come under the observation of the writers in three of which they personally super intended the administration of the gaseous enemata the fourth being seen only once in consultation but the records of which were accurately kept by the attending physician With reference to all these cases it is stated that after a fair trial of from two to four weeks it was deemed expedient and proper that it be discontinued for the two following reasons first it did no permanent  in deed it might almost safely be said not even transient good while second it was most disagreeable and annoying to the pa tients who generally were the first to suggest or even beg for its withdrawal CHLOROFORMING WHILE ASLEEP  In the August number of the New Orledns Medical and Surgical Journal is an editorial comment on the subject of chloroforming persons while asleep The editor says that there are several points relating to the physio logical action of chloroform which have an important bearing on the question The condition of health and the age of the person are matters to be considered in regard to the possibility of chloro forming people while asleep To adults in perfect health chloro form is a decided cerebral stimulant and it may be stated as a rule to which the exceptions are exceedingly rare that healthy adults cannot be chloroformed while asleep unless their sleep has been induced by exhaustion or hypnotic agents Weakly adults and children take chloroform with less resistance as the stimulant effect on the cerebrum is less in degree and shorter in duration Weakly adults and those acutely exhausted by disease or injury may be chloroformed during sleep Children may also be chloro formed while asleep and especially if they are depressed on any account The editor recently demonstrated to several physicians the ease with which chloroform could be administered to a sleep ing child when in a state of depression The case was one of cancer of the mesentery in which the little patient had been ex hausted by pain and restlessness The victims of chloroform at the hands of burglars are usually at the time in good health The more improbable then is the story usually told of such burglaries Under all conditions anaesthesia by chloroform can be accomplished during sleep only by skilful administration Overdosage at the outset will certainly awaken the sleeper The ability of burglars to force the anaesthesia of several persons sleeping in the same room without raising an alarm is to be doubted In regard to the im pression which prevails that burglars impregnate the air of an apartment with chloroform vapor so as to gradually anaesthetize all the sleepers at the same time the editor says that the weight of chloroform vapor and the readiness with which it descends make it difficult to saturate the air of a sleeping apartment especially one II4 VOL X No 239SCIENCE at the time well ventilated Besides the quantity of chloroform necessary to saturate the air sufficiently to produce anaesthesia is very considerable Allowing one and a half grain of chloroform to the cubic inch of air it would require thirtyeight fluid ounces to sufficiently impregnate the air of a room ten by twelve feet with a ceiling eight feet high It would certainly take a considerable time to vaporize this quantity of chloroform to say nothing of the probability of awakening sleepers by any act of atomization and even if it should succeed what would be the effect on the burglars themselves  MENTAL SCIENCE Why do we Sleep  IN an address to the Anthropological Society of Brussels Prof Leo Errera has given a resumer of some points in the chemical theory of sleep The phenomena of sleep have in common with other vital functions the character of periodicity An examination of such periodic functions in general may aid in ascertaining the cause of sleep The respiratory rhythm is regulated by the amount of oxygen and carbonic acid in the arterial blood When the blood is charged with oxygen the respiratory centre momentarily sus pends activity but soon the tissues yield their oxygen to the blood have it replaced by carbonic acid andthe blood thus modified acts as an excitant to the respiratory centre Ranke has shown that the fatigue and recovery of muscles is due to a similar alternation of the accumulation and discharge of certain fatiguing substances chief amongst which is lactic acid An injection of this acid into fresh muscle renders it incapable of work washing the acid out restores the activity Cannot sleep be explained by a similar chem ical theory  Preyer has extended the views of Binz Obersteiner and others who all agree in making the accumulation of certain products of fatigue ermiidungssloffe  the cause of sleep by calling all such fatiguing products of activity  ponogens These accumulate in waking life are readily oxidizable and absorb the oxygen intended for glands muscles and nervecentres until action is impossible and sleep sets in Gradually the ponogens are de stroyed by oxidation slight excitation is sufficient to arouse the centres and waking life begins Amongst the ponogens Preyer counts lactic acid as the chief but the experimental demonstration of this has been unsuccessful and the theory accordingly not gen erally adopted Since these researches Armand Gautier has found in the human body a series of five organic bases akin to creatine creatinine and xanthine and calls them  leucomaines and ptomaines The physiological properties of these substances are narcotic fatiguing and sometimes lead to vomiting This is just what the chemical theory requires The periodicity of sleep would be explained by the conservation of energy being applicable to all bodily activity work must be followed by repair life is a slow suicide There is moreover reason to believe that the action of these leucomaines is a direct one upon the brain it is a direct intoxication of the brain centres A theory of sleep must take account of three factors work fatigue and sleep The chemical theory satisfies these demands All work muscular or cerebral produces waste products These accumulate make work more and more difficult this is fatigue As the process continues the wasteproducts notably the leuco maines intoxicate the higher nervecentres just as a dose of mor phine does and render them incapable of action that is sleep The picture is however much more complex There is a constant struggle against the fatigue which for a time by dint of hard work shown in increased secretions and so on may succeed We proba bly never arrive at the extreme limit of work the sensation of fa tigue intervenes to prevent such a disaster Fatigue as is well known may extend from muscle to nerve and from nerve to nerve centre We may be very tired from repeatedly lifting a weight and not be sleepy and may be generally sleepy without any considera ble local fatigue One is peripheral the other central As the waste products accumulate in the centres motion and sensation be come more and more sluggish until the time comes when the or dinary stimulation no longer arouses them and we sleep Partial sleep can be similarly explained The centres go to sleep in a hierarchical order the highest serving the most delicate function It5 going first In waking the reverse is the case the motor centres may be asleep while the intellectual centres are awake In som nambulism the latter may be asleep while the former are awake The depth of sleep according to this theory ought to be propor tional to the number of cortical molecules in combination with the leucomaines In the beginning of sleep these are abundant the cerebral cells inactive and a combination easy The sleep is deep Soon the maximum number of combinations is reached and sleep is deepest From here on the leucomaines are gradually eliminated and destroyed and sleep should decrease with a decreasing in tensity Kohlschiitters experiments on the intensity of sleep as tested by the noise necessary to awake the patient gives the curve for the intensity of sleep corresponding to what we should expect by our theory Variations in our sleep caused by an excess of work etc are evidently similarly explicable In short fatigue is a poison for which sleep is the normal antidote This theory maintains i that the activity of all the tissues and primarily of the two most active the nervous and muscular gives rise to substances more or less allied to alkaloids the leucomaines a 2 that these induce fatigue and sleep 3 that on waking if the body is rested these substances have disappeared To complete the demonstration of these statements much careful experimentation is necessary but the facts as far as they go make it probable that the chemical theory of sleep will gain in strength as our knowledge advances ETHNOLOGICAL NOTES THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDSDr E Arnings researches have been very successful He was sent there by the curators of the Hum boldt Fund at Berlin in order to study leprosy which has recently become the plague of the natives of this group He stayed there for two and a half years and during this time carefully collected relics of the ancient Hawaiian culture and succeeded in bringing to light many points of interest thus proving that European influence which has swamped the islands since I820 has not totally de stroyed the remembrance of olden times When the missionaries es tablished their schools in Hawaii the natives rapidly adopted Euro pean customs burnt their temples and idols and cast the stone images of their deities into the sea The destruction was so complete that no traces seemed to remain Arning in studying the disease mentioned had ample opportunities to come into contact with the natives in the remote villages of the islands and here he found still many relics and received information about the ancient arts and customs His notes on the fishery of the Hawaiians are of interest They were skilful divers and used to frighten the fishes out of the caves and hollows of the rocky ground with sticks and then catch them in nets When fishing in the canoe they used a sacred piece of heavy wood called melomelo which was kept in the sacred part of the hut and was placed with many ceremonies in the canoe It was attached to the net in order to attract the fish by its magic spells A variety of hooks were used for different kinds of fish and according to the time of day irisated shells being applied at noon and in a bright sun while white ones served early in the morning and late in the evening Arning describes their games the wooden sledges on which they used to glide down the steep slopes of the mountains the remarkable boards of koawood shaped like an iron ing board standing on which they rode through the surf the moa a spindleshaped piece of heavy wood the use of which was allowed to the chiefs alone who let it glide down the slope of a hill at the foot of which it had to pass between two poles and the famous game of maika which is similar to the Italian boccia At the present time when a powerful reaction against the missionaries is spreading all over the islands the old hula dance has been revived and the ancient dancing ornaments and musical instruments are used again Arning describes a foot ornament made of 960 canine teeth of dogs the work of several generations for dogs were slaughtered only at high festivals  their drums flutes and xylophones Arnings observations and collections form one of the most important recent contributions to Polynesian ethnology and are the more valuable as they were made in a country which seemed to have lost all its originality by its rapid commercial de velopment SEPTEMBER 2 I887

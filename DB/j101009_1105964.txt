Prejudicial Er rorIn State v Randall 173 N W 425 the Supreme Court of Min nesota held that it was prejudicial error to limit defendants wit nesses to twelve of the twentyseven he had produced to testify on the main issue of his defense The court said The authorities seem to be in accord on the proposition that the trial court may in the exercise of sound judi cial discretion limit the number of witnesses as to any collateral fact or as to a given point in criminal as well as in civil cases State v Beabout 100 Iowa 155 69 N W 429 People v Casselman 10 Cal App 234 101 Pac 693 character witnesses Commonwealth v Thomas 104 S W 326 31 Ky Law Rep 899 character witnesses State v Bowerman 140 Mo App 410 124 S W 41 on impeach ment of witnesses State v Lamb 141 Mo 298 42 S W 827 upon alibi In Sheppard v State 120 Ark 160 179 S W 168 the court said it was within sound judicial discretion to limit the number of witnesses as to a particular fact and to decide at what point to stop the introduction of cumulative evidence We find no case holding squarely that on the main issue the court may limit the number of a partys witnesses unless it be in Butler v State 97 Ind 378 a murder charge where it is said If the court had no discretion in such cases then the case might be indefinitely delayed and an unlimited number of witnesses called But for this rule courts would be subject to the caprice of counsel and public good would    suffer We agree that this dis cretion should be so exercised as not to impair the rights of a de fendant nevertheless it does exist But as the power is a discre tionary one an appellate court can only interfere where it has been abused If we can say from the record that the discretion has been abused then we should review the ruling and reverse the judgment This we cannot say for the number of witnesses was limited to 45 and this in itself was not an unreasonable limitation It may however be said that it does not clearly appear from the case as reported whether this restriction of the number of witnesses applied to those who could testify regarding the main issue In Mergentheim v State 107 Ind 567 8 N E 568 a prosecution for maintaining a canal so as to constitute a nuisance the court fol lowed Butler v State supra and held it proper exercise of judi cial discretion to limit the number of witnesses as to the odor and condition of the canal It was fixed at 7 The syllabus in Samuels v United States 232 Fed 536 146 C C A 494 Ann Cas 1917A 711 states It is within the discretion of the trial court to limit the number of witnesses of a defendant charged with criminal offense may in troduce on a single point in issue and unless it appears clearly that there has been an abuse of discretion which was prejudicialNOTES OF CASES to defendant an appellate court will not consider it cause for reversal That was a prosecution for using the mails to defraud the par ticular fraud consisting in advertising a worthless remedy as a cure all thereby obtaining money by misrepresentations After the de fendant had produced 35 witnesses who testified that they had been cured of different ailments by the use of his preparation the court announced that only 6 more would be permitted to testify along that line The court said that at best the evidence was merely cumulative and it was discretionary whether more than fortyone should be allowed to testify In re Winslow 146 Iowa 67 124 N W 895 Ann cas 1912B 663 might also be cited as supporting the proposition that on the main issue the number of witnesses to be heard is dis cretionary with the trial court These four cases are the only authorities which might tend to sustain the rule which the learned trial court conceived to be applicable namely that it rested within his discretion to limit the number of witnesses But it is to be noted that had the limitation of the number of witnesses in the instant case been near as generous as in the Butler or Samuel cases defen dant would have had no occasion to complain However the weight of authority is to the effect that in neither a criminal nor in a civil case is it within the province of the court to limit the number of witnesses which a party may offer to prove or disprove the main issue or a controlling fact In People v Arnold 248 Ill 169 93 N E 786 a rape case the court limited the character witnesses to twentyfive and it was said The court fixed that limit for each side and while a court has no power to limit the number of witnesses to be heard as to a con trolling fact or facts and circumstances bearing thereon it is not error to fix a reasonable limit concerning collateral matters such as this was To the same effect is Green v Phoenix Mutual Life Ins Co 134 Ill 310 25 N E 583 10 L R A 576 where the court speaking of this power says Familiar illustrations of cases in which the discretion could not be exercised where the inquiry is single as in cases of right of way the grant of a prescriptive right the proof of custom or the identity of persons or property which are disputed will readily occur to any one The trial court restricted the defendant in a slander case to ten witnesses to prove plaintiffs reputation This was held error in Ward v Dick 45 Conn 235 29 Am Rep 677 the opinion saying The subject of the inquiry was the value of a reputation To the law this is a tangible thing it is properly in the highest sense and we are not aware that in actions for injuries to property courts have assumed the right either to prevent the plaintiff from estab 969 1920 5 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S lishing the value thereof at the highest possible point to which he could carry it by the power of testimony or the defendant from di minishing it by the same means and actions for injuries to char acter are not exceptions In St Louis M  S Ry v Aubuchon 199 Mo 352 97 S W 867 9 L R A N S 426 116 Am St Rep 499 8 Ann Cas 822 strong reasons for not restricting the number of witnesses on the main issue are stated in the vigorous and characteristic language of Justice Lamm In Barhyte v Summers 68 Mich 341 36 N W 93 a new trial was granted because the court limited the nvmber of witnesses upon a vital issuethe soundness of a horse claimed sold under misrepresentations This case is approved in the later one of Sulkowski v Zynda 160 Mich 7 124 N W 536 136 Am St Rep 414 In a case involving the quality of paint purchased plaintiff desired to take the deposition of 250 witnesses defendant petitioned to reduce the number but the court denied the petition Carrara Paint Agency Co v Carrara Paint Co C C 137 Fed 319 ee also Jones on Evidence  814 and 900 and cases collected in 8 Ann Cas 828 We approve of the rule that upon the vital controverted issue in a case the trial court should refrain from any attempt to limit the number of the witnesses that a party may offer unless a purpose to trifle with the administration of justice becomes apparent 970  April

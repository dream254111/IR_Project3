with the peculiar fea tures found in their figures The bird above men tioned Kuch is generally represented by a head with certain lines about the eye used in the complete figure to indicate the species An idol is denoted by the character a head which Dr Schellhas errone ously supposes to be the symbol for a certain deity The symbol for game quadrupeds is a rabbits head mounted on the Kan or corn symbol that for game birds a turkeys head on the corn symbol etc Inanimate objects are usually denoted by con ventional symbols having as the chief idea some characteristic of the thing represented For in stance the symbol for house or hut found in all the codices has as its chief characteristics broken lines indicating the thatching and perpendicular lines suggesting the posts I have determined the signification of one charac ter in which color plays a part This is the symbol for Ekchuah the god of pedlers or travelling mer chants This is a basinshaped character indicating the half of a calabash Chu in Maya surrounded by a heavy shading of black Ek in Maya It is found accompanying the black deity in the Troano Codex A few of the written characters are truly phonetic but my scant knowledge of the Maya language ren ders progress in this branch of the subject slow That there are no true lettercharacters as supposed by Landa must be conceded I may add in closing that I have discovered in the Cortesian Codex the origin of this authors A It is the symbol used to denote the turtle Aac the conventional representa tion of the head of this reptile and is in no sense phonetic A paper explaining these and other discoveries has been prepared for the bureau annual and is now in the hands of the printer CYRus THOMlAS Youngsville Penn Jan 10 On the coloration of mammals I desire to call attention to the arrangements of the colormarks on the skin of mammals and to at tempt to show that some of them are correlated to the distribution of nerves and to the positions of the musclemasses of the body The white stripe on the side of the trunk in Tamias is the region of distribution of the superficial branches of the intercostal nerves and those nerves in serial homology with them The white patches on the muzzle of the tiger an swer to the distribution of the infraorbital nerves The single black stripe on the withers of Equus taeniopus lies near the centre of the region of the scapula In the tiger the abdominal stripes are in the same series with those on the flank In the locality last named they range over the muscles and the depressions between them without regard to the anatomical conformation of the parts On the an terior extremity it is quite different In the lioness the depression between the radial extensor mass and the flexor mass is marked at the distal end of the region with a longitudinal black stripe which is about onefifth the length of the forearm The skin over the extensors of the carpus is marked by a number of spots and that over the flexor mass by a few trans verse bars The contrast between the two divisions of the forearm is decided VOL IX No 206 In both the lioness and the tiger the cervical mass and the gular region are separated by differences in coloration Two oblique stripes are seen limited to the cervical mass The depressions between the acromiocephalic and the brachialis anticus muscles are marked by black stripes The general distribution of the spots and stripes on the skin over the scapula and the muscles which are inserted into it and over the extensor aspect of the anterior extremity form a separate group from those of the rest of the trunk The line of the malar bone of the tiger is distin guished by a broad irregular bar A more slender one lies vertically over the masseter muscle In addition to the above it is found that the wrin kles and folds in one animal answer to the per manent skinbands or pigmentlines in another The dorsifacial folds of Phacochoerus are in the same positions as the pigmentlines in the zebra The bands on the trunk of the ninebanded armadillo are the homologues of the transient folds of skin seen in the instantaneous photographs of the hog taken at the time when the limbs of the same side are at the nearest point one to the other The mediodorsal stripe which is so often met with in mammals is probably a sequence of the general deeplying cause which determines the longitudinal type of the vertebrate form The disposition for the neck witherF and the an terior limb to be more hairy than is the remainder of the trunk is probably associated with the localiza tion of the marks on the anterior extremity being better marked than are those on the posterior The forelimb has connections with the head as exact as with the dorsum as far back as the origin of the latissimus dorsi In the bison the shaggy surface corresponds quite accurately to the proximal part of the forelimb and its extrinsic muscles A mammal in leaving the ground from the hind limbs hunches up the withers in a conspicuous man ner This region is more thickly haired and more brightly colored in many bats than is the rest of the trunk Now in the bat the shoulders and neck are permanently hunched for the forelimbs are scarcely at all used for support HAxRISON ALLEN Philadelphia Jan 4 Butterflies in southern Connecticut During the summer and autumn of 1884 and 1885 I was collecting butterflies in southern Connecticut In the first season I found Pyrameis cardui very abundant P huntera comparatively rare while of P atlanta I saw only two specimens both of which I secured The next summer on precisely the same ground and in the same time I took all I wanted of P atlanta only two of the huntera while I did not see a single specimen of P cardui I should be glad if some one would explain this I do not imagine my collections could have been extensive enough to seriously affect the abundance of any of the species in the locality I might also say that of a large number of speci mens of Argynnis idalia taken in the two seasons a very great majority were females and of the males not one was in a perfect condition most of them being badly torn and much faded This would seem to indicate that they appeared before the females L N JOHNSON Evanston Ill Jan 8

j100133,The Condor,1361273,A Bit of Early California Natural History,i259136,A BIT OF EARLY CALIFORNIA NATURAL HISTORY By FRANK S DAGGETT I RECENTLY came across a set of twenty volumes published by the author Dr John Trusler entitled The Habitable World Described Volume I was published in 1788 and the last one in 1795 They contain many plates and a great amount of information from countries then but little known Volume VII136 THE CONDOR VOL X contains a description of California from the Spanish of Michael Venegas a Mexi can Jesuit published at Madrid in 1758 and others Of course we are most in terested in what he says about animals and birds In California are now found all kinds of domeftic animals commonly ufed in Spain and Mexico horfes mules affes oxen fheep hogs goats dogs and cats They have been imported from New Spain and thrive here very well but here are two fpecies of wild animals not known in Old or New Spain The firft is that which Californians call Taye it is about the fize of a calf a year and a half old and greatly refembles it in figure except in its head which is like that of a deer with very thick horns like a ram its hoof is large round and cloven like that of an ox its fkin is fpotted like a deer but the hair thinner and it has a short tail like a deer the flefh is very palatable and to fome taftes delicious The other animal peculiar to this country is the Cayote or wild dog very much refembling a fox Here are alfo leopards such as they call lions in Mexico goats cats and wild hogs are frequently found in the mountains and Father Torquemada obferves that about MonteRey are very large bears tigers an animal fomething like a buffalo and a creature which he thus describes it is about the fize of a fteer but fhaped like a ftag its hair refembles that of a pelican and is a quarter of a yard in length its neck long and on its head are horns like thofe of a ftag the tail is a yard long and half a yard broad and its feet cloven like the feet of an ox Of birds there are an infinite variety Among thefe for the table are turtle doves herons quails pheafants geefe ducks and pidgeons The birds of prey are vultures hawks falcons offiphages hornowls ravens and crows Of night birds there are owls and many others of a fmaller kind not feen in other parts nor mentioned by any naturalifts nor have the narratives of the Jefuits fupplied us with a defcription or even with the names of them California has a great variety of fingingbirds as larks nightingales and the like adorned with beautiful plumages Torquemada fays that about the harbour of MonteRey are buftards peacocks geefe thrufhes fwallows fparrows gold finches linnets quails partridges blackbirds waterwagtails cranes and other birds refembling turkeycocks so large as to be 17 palms from the extremity of one wing to that of the other and alfo a particular fpecies of gulls that live on pilch ards and other filth equal in fize to a very large goofe their bill a foot long with long legs refembling a ftork their beak and feet like thofe of a goofe They have a vaft craw which in fome hangs down like the leather bottles ufed in Peru for carrying water in which craws they carry what they catch to their young ones The friendly difpofition of thefe birds is fomething furprifing for they affift one another when fick or wounded and bring that bird provifion that is unable to fearch for it The Indians profit by this for when they want a difh of fifh they will wound and tie a gull to a particular fpot conceal themfelves and when they think all the provifion is brought them which other gulls defigned they advance and feize the contribution fuch are the mysterious ways of Providence for the fupport of his creatures Father Torquemada fpeaking of the ifland of St Catherine in the neigh bourhood of California fays In this ifland are rancherias or communities and in them a temple with a large level court where they perform their facrifices and in one was a large circular fpace the place of the altar with an enclofure of feathers of feveral birds of different colours which I underftood says he were thofe of the birds they facrificed in great numbers and within the circle was an image ftrangely bedaubed with a variety of colours reprefenting fome devil acJuly 1908 A BIT OF EARLY CALIFORNIA NATURAL HISTORY 137 cording to the manner of the Indians of New Spain holding in its hand a figure of the fun and moon It happened that when the foldiers came to fee this temple they found within the faid circle two crows confiderably larger than ordinary which at the approach of the Spaniards flew away but alighted among the rocks in the neighbourhood The foldiers feeing them of fuch uncommon fize fired their guns and killed them At this an Indian who had attended the Spainards as a guide fell into an agony I was informed that they believed the devil fpoke to them in thefe crows and thence held them in great veneration Sometime after one of the foldiers going that way faw fome Indian women wafhing fifh on the shore but fome crows came up to them and with their beaks took the fifh from their hands whilst they observed a profound silence not daring fo much as to look at them much lefs frighten them away Nothing therefore could feem more horri ble to the Californians than that the Spainards fhould fhoot at thefe refpectable birds  Chicago Illinois

J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1011672,WATER POWER IN THE UNITED STATES,I242597,WATER POWER IN THE UNITED STATES BY M 0 LEIGHTON CHIEF HYDROGRAPHER UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY WASHINGTON D C THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES MUST GIVE UP THEIR LEADERSHIP IN THE PRODUCTIVE WORLD WHEN THEY SHALL HAVE PLACED IN USE ALL THEIR SOURCES OF CHEAP MECHANICAL ENERGY PRESENTDAY LEADERSHIP IN THE PRODUCTIVE WORLD MUST BE BASED ON ENERGY THIS ENERGY MUST IN THE FIRST PLACE BE AN INHERENT QUALITY OF THE PEOPLE AND IN THE SECOND PLACE THERE MUST BE AN ABUNDANT EXTERNAL SUPPLY WHICH THE PEOPLE CAN HARNESS AND SUBDUE WHATEVER AMOUNT OF THE ONE THERE MAY BE THERE CAN BE NO LEADER SHIP OF LONG STANDING WITHOUT A FULLY PROPORTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE OTHER THE CONVERSE IS QUITE AS TRUE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE POSSESS LIMITLESS INHERENT ENERGY THEREFORE THEIR INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS MUST BE DEPENDENT UPON THE AMOUNT OF EXTERNAL POWER THAT THEY CAN COMMAND THIS PROGRESS CAN CONTINUE UP TO A POINT AT WHICH THE CHEAP POWER IS ALL PLACED IN USE THEREAFTER THE BEST THAT OUR PEOPLE CAN DO IS TO HOLD FAST BUT SUCH A CONDITION IS UNSTABLE SOME OTHER PEOPLE MAKING SKILLFUL AND ENERGETIC USE OF A LARGER AMOUNT OF POWER WOULD NOT ONLY TAKE THE LEADERSHIP BUT IN CON FORMITY WITH THE SCRIPTURAL PARABLE OF THE TALENTS THEY WOULD BY VIRTUE OF THEIR LARGER POSSESSION TAKE FROM OUR PEOPLE THAT WHICH THEY ALREADY HAVE IT IS A FAITHFUL SAYING THAT A HALT IN PROGRESS MARKS THE BEGINNING OF A BACKWARD MOVEMENT THE FINDING OUT OF WHAT KIND AND OF HOW MUCH MECHANICAL ENERGY THERE IS READY FOR USE IN THIS COUNTRY IS THE FIRST STEP IN SHAPING OUR FUTURE INDUSTRIAL EXPECTATIONS THE PROCESS OF THE FIND ING THEREFORE BECOMES ONE OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT MATTERS OF PUBLIC DUTY IF OUR PROMISED NEEDS FOR MECHANICAL ENERGY BID FAIR IN THE NEAR FUTURE TO CONSUME OR TO UTILIZE ALL OUR SOURCES OF POWER THEN WILL IT BE A PART OF WISDOM TO APPROACH THAT CRISIS WITH OUR EYES OPEN ON THE OTHER HAND IF OUR SOURCES ARE SO VAST THAT THE END MAY NOT BE REACHED FOR MANY GENERATIONS THEN OUR PROBLEM IS RE DUCED TO A WISE SELECTION OF THE BEST AND MOST ECONOMICAL USE OF THAT WHICH WE HAVE 535THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY TWO MAIN POINTS SHOULD BE BORNE IN MIND FIRST THAT WE SHALL MAKE FULL USE OF THE KIND OF POWER THAT WILL FINALLY BE THE CHEAPEST SECOND THAT WE SHALL BE AS MISERLY IN THE USE OF OUR SOURCES OF ENERGY THAT BECOME IMPOVERISHED IN THE USING AS IS CONSISTENT WITH FINAL EFFICIENCY AND PURPOSEFUL RESULTS THE MERE POSSESSION OF GREAT SOURCES OF MECHANICAL ENERGY WILL NOT INSURE INDUSTRIAL LEADERSHIP EACH SOURCE MUST BE PROPERLY HARNESSED HAVING DONE THIS IT BE HOOVES US TO HAVE A CARE THAT WE DO NOT HABITUALLY BURDEN OUR FAMILY DRIVING HORSE WITH A LOAD ADAPTED TO A PERCHERON LEADERSHIP IN THE PRODUCTIVE WORLD MAY DEPEND UPON THE WIS DOM WITH WHICH THE SOURCES OF MECHANICAL ENERGY ARE CHOSEN QUITE AS MUCH AS UPON THE SKILL WITH WHICH THAT ENERGY IS USED AS ONE GENERATION FOLLOWS ANOTHER AND LEAVES NO GAP BETWEEN SO THE METHODS AND THE TOOLS OF THE ONE BEING CHEAPER OR MORE EFFECTIVE OR LESS DESTRUCTIVE THAN THOSE OF THE OTHER GRADUALLY DRIVE THEM FROM THE FIELD IT IS NECESSARY IN THE USE OF MECHANICAL ENERGY TO CHOOSE THAT WHICH IS CHEAPEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE IT WOULD BE OF LITTLE USE FOR THE PEOPLE OF ONE COUNTRY TO POSSESS AND TO USE A CERTAIN SOURCE OF ENERGY BE IT EVER SO ABUNDANT IF THAT ENERGY WERE NOT AS EFFICIENT OR WERE MORE COSTLY THAN THAT USED BY THE PEOPLE OF ANOTHER COUNTRY SUCH A SITUATION WOULD MERELY SUGGEST THE COMPARI SON OF TWO ARTISANS ONE OF WHOM USES POOR AND THE OTHER GOOD TOOLS IF THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY PERSIST IN USING A COSTLY FORM OF ENERGY WHICH BY THE VERY USE THEREOF HASTENS THE FINAL IMPOVERISHMENT OF THE AVAILABLE SUPPLY THEY CAN NOT EXPECT ALWAYS TO COMPETE WITH THE PEOPLE OF ANY OTHER COUNTRY WHO USE A CHEAP AND EFFECTIVE AGENT OF MECHANICAL POWER WHICH MOREOVER IS NOT IMPOVERISHED THE UNITED STATES IS USING OVER 26OOOOOO HORSE POWER PRO DUCED BY FUEL AND PRINCIPALLY BY THE USE OF COAL IN STEAM BOILERS UTMOST INGENUITY HAS BEEN PRACTICED BY THE ENGINEERING PROFESSION IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF METHODS OF STEAM PRODUCTION AND UTILIZATION THE COST OF INSTALLING A STEAM PLANT IS COMPARATIVELY SMALLFAR LESS THAN THE FIRST COST OF A WATERPOWER PLANT OF SIMILAR CAPACITY MOREOVER IT IS EASY AND CONVENIENT TO SET UP A STEAM POWER UNIT WELL SUITED TO THE TRANSIENT DEMANDS AND THERE IS A CERTAIN SATISFAC TION IN THE COMPLETENESS AND INDEPENDENCE THAT IT AFFORDS UNTIL YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE THE STEAM PLANT WAS PRACTICALLY THE 536 52WATER POWER IN THE UNITED STATES ONLY AGENT OF POWER THAT COULD BE THE RESORT EXCEPT IN UNUSUAL AND OFTEN INCONVENIENT LOCALITIES ALL OF THESE AS WELL AS SUNDRY OTHER CONSIDERATIONS DEVELOPED IN THE POWER USER THE STEAM BOILER HABIT THIS WAS BUT NATURAL THE MAN WHO SOUGHT TO ESTABLISH HIMSELF IN A MANUFACTURING BUSINESS WISHED TO PLACE HIMSELF ON A PROFITABLE OPERATING BASIS AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE TIME HE CHOSE THE CHEAPER POWER INSTALLATIONS AS A FIRST INVESTMENT TRUSTING THAT THE PROFITS OF THE BUSINESS WOULD JUSTIFY HIM EVEN THOUGH HIS SUBSEQUENT EXPENSES OF MAINTENANCE WERE HIGHER THAN THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN WITH WATER POWER IN OTHER WORDS HE PREFERRED A SMALL IMMEDIATE EXPENDITURE TO A SMALL ULTIMATE ONE THE STEAM PLANT FAIRLY MET THE CONDITIONS BUT IT HAS ALL BEEN THE RESULT OF SURPASSING INGENUITY AND ADAPTATION THERE ARE BEING USED IN THIS COUNTRY ONLY ABOUT FIVE AND ONE HALF MILLION HORSE POWERS DEVELOPED BY FALLING WATER ESPECIALLY IN THE EARLIER DAYS DO WE FAIL TO FIND ANYTHING LIKE THE DEGREE OF INGENUITY IN THE ADAPTATION OF SUCH POWER WHICH WE FIND IN THE USE OF STEAM THERE IS A GOOD REASON FOR THIS WHICH WILL BE DISCUSSED LATER THAT WHICH IT IS DESIRED TO EMPHASIZE HERE IS THAT UP TO THE DAY OF ELECTRICAL TRANSMISSION WATER POWER WAS USED ONLY WHERE IT WAS SITUATED SO CONVENIENTLY AND DEVELOPED SO CHEAPLY THAT THE ECONOMY WAS SELFEVIDENT BEFORE THE DAY OF STEAM OUR MANUFAC TURING CENTERS WERE LOCATED AT WATER POWERS AFTER THE DEVELOP MENT OF THE COMPOUND ENGINE POWER CENTERS SPRANG UP IN THE ALMOST WATERLESS PLAINS THE INDUSTRIAL WORLD WENT STEAM MAD WHAT OF THE CONSEQUENCES THERE IS NO DISPOSITION TO CLAIM THAT THE ALMOST UNIVERSAL TURN TO STEAM WAS NOT BASED UPON FUNDAMENTAL NECESSITIES IT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS FOR OUR INDUSTRIAL ADVANCEMENT AND IT MUST EVER MARK AN EPOCH IN OUR CIVILIZATION BUT IT WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS DETRIMENT THE TIDE OF INDUSTRIAL FAVOR TURNED SQUARELY AWAY FROM WATER POWER IT WAS A DETHRONED MONARCH AND FEW WERE THOSE WHO GAVE IT THOUGHT THUS THE STEAM HABIT BECAME FIXED AND SO FIRMLY DOES IT HOLD SWAY THAT EVEN IN THIS DAY OF ELECTRICAL TRANSMISSION THE STEAM TIDE IS NOT CHECKED STEAM PLANTS ARE INSTALLED IN UTTER FORGETFULNESS OF WATER POWER POSSIBILITIES SUCH POWERS STILL AWAIT THE ENGROSSING ATTEN TION THAT WAS IN THE EARLIER DAY BESTOWED ON STEAM IN SPITE OF ALL THIS IT IS APPARENT TO EVERYONE WHO HAS EXAMINED INTO THE SITUATION THAT FUEL POWER IS MORE COSTLY THAN WATER POWER THEREFORE IN PER SISTING IN THE USE OF FUEL POWER THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY HAVE 537 53THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY BURDENED THEMSELVES WITH AN OFTEN NEEDLESS TAX SUCH A TAX MUST BE A HANDICAP IN THE FACE OF A WORLDS PROGRESS CAN WE AFFORD TO CARRY A HANDICAP  WE ARE NOT THE ONLY PROGRESSIVE PEOPLE ON EARTH THERE ARE OTHER NATIONS WHO WILL COMMAND OUR BEST EFFORTS IN THE RACE EVEN IF WE ARE STRIPPED FOR THE FRAY BY TURNING TO WATER POWER AS THEIR SOURCE OF MECHANICAL ENERGY THEY WILL EASILY OUT PRODUCE AND UNDERSELL US IT ALL RESTS ON THE WISE SELECTION OF THE CHEAPEST SOURCE OF ENERGY IT IS THE PARALLEL OF THE GOOD AND THE POOR TOOL OUR STORES OF FUEL ARE BEING CONSUMED AND THE PRICE THEREOF MUST INCREASE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF COAL CONSUMED IN THE UNITED STATES FROM ABOUT I814 TO THE CLOSE OF THE YEAR I908 IS 7279734143 TONS THE INCREASE IN COAL CONSUMPTION IS SHOWN BY THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT ANNUAL CONSUMPTION OF COAL IN THE UNITED STATES TONS 1898   219976267 1899    253741192 1900  269684027 901  293299816 1902  301590439 1903  357356416 I904  351816398 I905  392722635 1906   414157278 I907  480363424 I908  415000000 1895  I93 I7530 I89O  157770963 1885  111160295 I880  71481570 OUR STORES OF COAL HAVE BEEN WELL EXPLORED AND THOSE WHO KNOW MOST ABOUT THE SITUATION SAY THAT AT OUR PRESENT RATE OF INCREASE IN CONSUMPTION ALL OUR COAL WILL BE GONE BEFORE THE MIDDLE OF THE NEXT CENTURY AND SOME DECLARE THAT THE END WILL BE SEEN DURING THE PRESENT CENTURY NOW THIS MAY NOT SEEM IMPORTANT TO THE MAN WHO CONCEIVES THAT HE HAS NO DUTY BEYOND HIS DAY AND GENERATION 538 54WATER POWER IN THE UNITED STATES BUT HE IS MISTAKEN EVEN FROM HIS OWN STANDPOINT IT IS AN INEVITABLE NATURAL LAW THAT WHENEVER THE SUPPLY OF ANY COMMODITY BECOMES REDUCED THE PRICE THEREOF MUST INCREASE AND MOREOVER THE INCREASE IS PROGRESSIVE FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE IMPOVERISHMENT OF THAT SUPPLY UNTIL THE END THE COAL SUPPLY AND THE PRICE THEREOF FORM NO EXCEPTION TO THIS LAW THE PRICE OF COAL IS LOWER TODAY THAN IT WILL BE FIVE YEARS HENCE THE PRICE OF ANTHRACITE COAL HAS IN CREASED UNTIL THE LIMIT HAS PRACTICALLY BEEN REACHED THAT IS SO LONG AS OUR BITUMINOUS COALS REMAIN AT A PRICE APPROXIMATING THE PRES ENT MARKET VALUE IT WILL NOT BE ECONOMICAL TO PAY MORE FOR ANTHRA CITE COAL THAN APPROXIMATELY THE PRESENT MARKET PRICE THIS IS MERELY AN ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENT BETWEEN THE THERMAL EFFICIENCY AND THE MARKET PRICE OF THE TWO KINDS OF COAL BUT IT FORCIBLY ILLUSTRATES THE FACT THAT OUR DEMANDS UPON THE STORE OF ANTHRACITE COAL HAVE ALREADY IMPOVERISHED IT TO AN EXTENT THAT NEARLY DRIVES IT FROM THE MARKET AT THE PRESENT TIME AS THE COST OF COAL IS THE CHIEF ITEM IN THE COST OF STEAM POWER IT FOLLOWS THAT AN INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF COAL MUST MEAN AN INCREASE IN THE COST OF STEAM POWER WHICH WILL WIDEN THE MARGIN OF COST OF STEAM OVER WATER POWER THE HANDICAP IMPOSED BY EXCESSIVE COST OF STEAM POWER IS A GROWING ONE THE GREATER OUR PROGRESS UNDER STEAM POWER THE GREATER MUST BE THE UNIT PRICE THAT WE PAY FOR SUCH PROGRESS THE RIGHT WAY TO MEET THIS CONDITION IS TO LESSEN THE DE MAND THIS CAN BEST BE DONE BY SUPPLYING THE PEOPLE WITH MECHANI CAL ENERGY FROM RUNNING STREAMS ONLY A CERTAIN PART OF THE COAL THAT WE CONSUME IS USED FOR POWER GENERATION IT IS INEVITABLE THAT FOR A LONG TIME IN THE FUTURE COAL OR SIMILAR FUEL WILL BE NEEDED FOR MERE HEATING PURPOSES THERE FORE THERE IS A GOOD REASON FOR SAVING OUR COAL SUPPLY EVEN THOUGH THERE IS PROMISE THAT IT MAY NOT IN THE NEAR FUTURE BE NEEDED FOR POWER GENERATION ALTHOUGH AT THE PRESENT TIME OUR METHODS OF CONVERTING ELECTRICAL ENRGY INTO HEAT ARE TOO WASTEFUL TO BE ADOPTED ON ANY LARGE OR GENERAL SCALE WE MAY REASONABLY EXPECT THAT CON TINUED IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR METHODS OF CONVERSION WILL MAKE A PROGRESSIVE REDUCTION IN OUR DEPENDENCE ON THE USE OF FUEL FOR HEATING PURPOSES BUT EVEN IF OUR METHODS ARE IMPROVED FASTER THAN WE MAY REASONABLY EXPECT AT THE PRESENT TIME IT WILL BE SEVERAL CENTURIES BEFORE ALL OUR USE FOR FUEL WILL BE SUPPLANTED BY ANOTHER SOURCE OF ENERGY IT WILL BE OF INTEREST TO CONSIDER WHAT PROPORTION 539 55THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF THE COAL CONSUMED IN THE YEAR I9O8 MIGHT HAVE BEEN SAVED HAD THERE BEEN IN THIS COUNTRY A DEVELOPMENT OF WATER POWER SUFFICIENT TO SUPPLY THE GREATEST REASONABLE AND POSSIBLE DEMAND DUE REGARD BEING GIVEN TO CONSIDERATIONS OF MARKET AND COST OF WATERPOWER DEVELOPMENT SUCH A STATEMENT MUST BE BASED ON OUR PRESENT LIMITS OF ELECTRICAL TRANSMISSION AND CONVERSION AND BROADLY SPEAKING SUCH LIMITS MUST BE CONFINED TO THE USE OF WATER POWER FOR LIGHT AND MECHANICAL ENERGY WITH AN EFFICIENCY LIMIT OF TRANSMISSION AT I50 MILES AT LEAST ONETHIRD OF THE COAL NOW USED IN THE UNITED STATES COULD BE SAVED BY THE WISE AND CONSIDERATE DEVELOPMENT OF WATER POWER THERE ARE IN USE IN THE UNITED STATES SOMEWHAT MORE THAN 26OOOOOO HORSE POWERS PRODUCED FROM FUEL PRINCIPALLY IN THE FORM OF STEAM POWER NOT ALL OF THIS POWER COULD BE SUPPLIED FROM WATERPOWER PLANTS THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT THERE ARE MANY GREAT STEAMPOWER CENTERS LOCATED AT POINTS REMOTE FROM GREAT WATER POWERS TO SUPPLY THE LARGE DEMANDS AT THOSE POINTS IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO TRANSMIT ELECTRICAL ENERGY OVER GREATER DISTANCES THAN CAN BE DONE EFFICIENTLY AT PRESENT THE LONGEST TRANSMISSION IN THE UNITED STATES IS 220 MILES BUT THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED ONLY WITH A SACRIFICE OF ECONOMY THIS POWER STATION IS ONE OF A CONNECTED CHAIN FROM WHICH ENERGY IS SUPPLIED TO SEVERAL CENTERS OF UTILIZATION THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THE DEMAND AT THE MOST REMOTE POINT IN THE SYSTEM IS GREATER THAN CAN BE SUPPLIED BY THE NEARBY STATIONS AND IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO MAKE UP THE DEFICIENCIES BY TRANSMITTING FROM THE FARTHERMOST STATION 220 MILES DISTANT IN OTHER WORDS THIS TRANSMISSION IS THE RESORT OF NECESSITY RATHER THAN THE PRACTICE OF ECONOMY THOSE MOST FAMILIAR WITH THE PRACTICAL SIDE OF ELECTRIC POWER TRANSMISSION TESTIFY THAT UNDER PRESENT CONDITIONS THE LINE LOSSES INCREASE DISPROPORTIONATELY BEYOND A DISTANCE OF ABOUT I00 MILES OF COURSE LONGER TRANSMISSION IS FAIRLY COMMON AND NOT WITHOUT PROFIT TO THE PRODUCER BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THE SHORTER TRANSMISSION IS FAR MORE PROFITABLE PER KILOWATT HOUR THE CONDITIONS ABOVE STATED WOULD APPLY WITH FORCE IN CASE IT WERE ATTEMPTED TO SUBSTITUTE ELECTRIC POWER FOR ALL OUR PRESENT STEAM PLANTS THE CITY OF NEW YORK FOR EXAMPLE IS PROBABLY THE 540 56WATER POWER IN THE UNITED STATES GREATEST CENTER OF MECHANICAL POWER CONSUMPTION IN THE UNITED STATES IF NOT IN THE WORLD WATER POWERS SITUATED WITHIN THE PRES ENT LIMITS OF EFFICIENT TRANSMISSION TO THIS CITY WOULD NOT SUPPLY MORE THAN A SMALL PART OF THE ENTIRE DEMAND THIS BEING THE CASE IT IS DOUBTFUL IF IT WOULD PAY TO TRY TO UTILIZE THAT WHICH MIGHT BE SUPPLIED SUCH CONDITION WILL OF COURSE BE CORRECTED IN THE FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE EFFICIENCY OF WIRE TRANSMISSION WILL SURELY BE MADE IT APPEARS TO THE AUTHOR AFTER TAKING A GENERAL VIEW OF THE ENTIRE COUNTRY THAT ABOUT EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE STEAM POWER USED COULD BE REPLACED BY WATER POWER LET US ASSUME FOR THE SAKE OF BEING CONSERVATIVE THAT THE AMOUNT IS SEVENTYFIVE PER CENT THIS MEANS THAT THERE ARE I9500000 HORSE POWERS WHICH PRESUMABLY MAY BE PRODUCED BY WATER POWER IT IS NOT MEANT BY THIS THAT EVERY UNIT INCLUDED IN THIS GREAT SUBSTITUTION COULD IMMEDIATELY BE PUT ON A PAYING BASISFAR FROM IT THE ULTIMATE BENEFIT MUST BE DE RIVED FROM THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE THE CASE RESEMBLES THAT OF A GREAT RAILROAD SYSTEM SOME OF THE BRANCHES ARE OPERATED AT A LOSS AND OTHERS AT AN IMMENSE PROFIT THE ALGEBRAIC SUM OF PROFITS AND LOSSES FOR THE WHOLE SYSTEM DETERMINES THE ULTIMATE PROFITS SO IN THE PRESENT DISCUSSION WE ARE CONSIDERING WATER POWER FROM THE BROAD STANDPOINT OF ESSENTIAL PUBLIC ECONOMY THE SUBJECT IS SO GREAT THAT THE GIMLETHOLE VIEW MUST BE INCOMPLETE THE PROGRESS OR POVERTY OF ANY PARTICULAR PLANT IS NOT OF IMMEDIATE IMPORTANCE IT IS NOT AN EASY TASK TO DETERMINE THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF COAL USED TO PRODUCE A HORSE POWER THROUGHOUT THE YEAR BOILERS AND ENGINES THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES DIFFER WIDELY IN EFFICIENCY THERE IS A SIMILAR VARIATION IN THE HEATPRODUCING QUALITY OF OUR COALS SOME OF THE POWER PRODUCED IN STEAM PLANTS IS USED ONLY TEN HOURS EACH DAY AND DURING THE REMAINING FOURTEEN HOURS LITTLE COAL IS USED OTHER PLANTS ARE IN PRACTICALLY CONSTANT OPERATION THEREFORE ANY ESTIMATE OF THE AVERAGE CONSUMPTION OF COAL PER HORSEPOWERYEAR FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY MUST BE SUBJECT TO ERRORS OF INDIVIDUAL JUDGMENT ALL THE FACTS HAVING BEEN CONSIDERED THE AUTHOR BELIEVES THAT TEN TONS PER HORSEPOWERYEAR IS FAIR AND REASON ABLE AND HE WILL USE THIS AS THE FACTOR ANY PERSON WHO BELIEVES ANOTHER FACTOR WOULD BE MORE SUITABLE MAY CHANGE THE FOLLOWING ES TIMATE ACCORDINGLY THE I9500000 STEAM HORSE POWERS ABOVE NAMED MUST HAVE REQUIRED THE BURNING OF I95000000 TONS OF COAL IN I908 WHICH IS ABOUT FORTYSEVEN PER CENT OF OUR TOTAL PRODUCTION 54I 57THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY FOR THAT YEAR THIS FIGURE PRESENTS A FAIR IDEA OF THE AMOUNT OF COAL THAT MIGHT BE SAVED BY THE SUBSTITUTION OF WATER POWER UNDER PRESENT LIMITS OF EFFICIENCY IN ELECTRIC CONVERSION AND TRANSMISSION WHAT DO THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY PAY FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF USING THEIR COAL IN THIS MANNER  THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES ARE PAYING A HIGH PRICE FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF IMPOVERISHING THEIR COAL RESOURCES WE MUST NOW FACE THE TASK OF ESTIMATING HOW MUCH MORE STEAM POWER COSTS THAN WATER POWER OF COURSE THE COST VARIES WITH THE PRICE OF COAL AND WITH THE EASE WITH WHICH WATER POWER MAY BE DEVELOPED IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE COUNTRY SOME WATER POWERS MAY BE IMPROVED AND OPERATED AT SMALL COST WHILE OTHERS ARE SO EXPENSIVE THAT THEY CAN NOT BE PROFITABLY BUILT AND OPERATED AT THE PRESENT MARKET PRICE OF POWER THIS MARKET PRICE VARIES ALSO IN THE GREAT NORTHWEST FOR EXAMPLE THE PRICE OF COAL IS HIGH WHILE WATER POWERS ESPECIALLY IN COLUMBIA RIVER BASIN MAY AS A RULE BE ESTABLISHED AT A RELATIVELY LOW COST ON THE OTHER HAND IN A COALMINING REGION WHERE COAL CAN BE PURCHASED AT A NOMINAL PRICE THE WATER POWER THAN CAN COMPETE WITH A STEAMPOWER PLANT MUST BE OF UNUSUAL CHEAPNESS AND EFFICIENCY THE CONDITIONS VARY SO WIDELY THAT THE BEST WAY TO ARRIVE AT SOME BASIS OF ESTIMATE IS TO SELECT SOME AREA WHICH FAIRLY REPRESENTS AVERAGE CONDITIONS IN THE AREA SO CHOSEN COAL SHOULD BE COMPARATIVELY CHEAP AND WATER ABUNDANT THE AUTHOR BELIEVES THAT SUCH AN AREA IS DEFINED BY THE STATE OF NEW YORK IT IS SITUATED SO NEAR THE PENNSYLVANIA COAL FIELDS AS TO MAKE THE PRICE OF COAL SOMEWHAT BELOW THE AVERAGE ON THE OTHER HAND NEW YORK IS BOUNTIFULLY SUPPLIED WITH WATER POWER PRIVILEGES THEREFORE THE RELATIVE COST OF THE TWO KINDS OF POWER IN NEW YORK OUGHT TO AFFORD A GOOD AS WELL AS A VERY CON SERVATIVE FACTOR FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY THE NEW YORK STATE WATER SUPPLY COMMISSION IN MAKING ITS THIRD ANNUAL REPORT IN I908 GAVE CAREFUL STUDY TO THE RELATIVE ADVANTAGE OF WATER POWER OVER STEAM POWER AND REPORTED THAT AT A LOW ESTIMATE THE ADVANTAGE OF WATER OVER STEAM POWER IS AT LEAST I200 PER HORSE POWER PER YEAR NOTE THAT THIS IS A LOW ESTIMATE FOR NEW YORK STATE AND NOTE FURTHER THAT IN THIS STATE STEAM POWER MUST BE RELATIVELY CHEAP THEREFORE IT SEEMS HARDLY POSSIBLE THAT IF THIS FACTOR OF I2OO BE 542 58WATER POWRER IN THE UNITED STATES USED FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY THE TOTAL WILL BE TOO HIGH APPLIED TO THE 19500000 H P ABOVE REFERRED TO THERE IS GIVEN THE STUPENDOUS ANNUAL CHARGE OF 234OOOOOO ANNUALLY WHICH MAY BE REGARDED AS A PENALTY FOR USING STEAM POWER SUPPOSING THIS AMOUNT WERE DE POSITED ANNUALLY TO CREATE A SINKING FUND CAN THERE BE ANY DOUBT THAT THE PRINCIPAL SUM WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO DEVELOP THE EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF WATER POWER AND ALSO TO PAY THE DAMAGES ARISING FROM THE ABANDONMENT OF STEAM PLANTS AS FAST AS THEY WERE WORN OUT IN SERVICE  THE MENACE TO AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL LEADERSHIP IS ALREADY ON THE HORIZON IT HAS BEEN STATED THAT LEADERSHIP IN THE PRODUCTIVE WORLD DE PENDS UPON A WISE CHOICE OF THE SOURCE OF MECHANICAL ENERGY TO BE UTILIZED IN SUCH PRODUCTION IT OUGHT TO BE CLEAR THAT WE AS A PEOPLE CAN NOT SUSTAIN THIS LEADERSHIP IF ANOTHER PEOPLE CHOOSE TO PURSUE A POLICY THAT WILL PLACE AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE MANUFACTURING WORLD A CHEAPER POWER THAN THAT WHICH WE SUPPLY IT BEHOOVES US TO LOOK ABOUT AND SEE WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS ANY INDICATION THAT SUCH A POLICY IS PRESENT OR PROSPECTIVE THE SITUATION IN SWITZERLAND IS NOT WITHOUT ITS MENACE THE PEOPLE THERE HAVE AWAKENED TO THE FACT THAT WHEREAS THEIR SCENERY IS A GREAT RESOURCE GREATER POSSIBILITIES LIE IN THEIR WATER POWERS THEY ARE DEVELOPING THESE POWERS WITH THE PROFESSED PURPOSE OF ATTRACTING WITHIN THEIR BOUNDARIES AS LARGE A NUMBER OF INDUSTRIES AS THEY CAN SUPPLY WITH MOTIVE POWER GREAT PLATEAUS AND BENCHES PREVIOUSLY GIVEN OVER TO AGRICULTURE ARE THE PROSPECTIVE SITES FOR SUCH MANUFACTURING PLANTS SO WIDE OF SCOPE IS THE PLAN THAT THOSE WHO REVERE THE SCENIC BEAUTIES OF SWITZERLAND ARE BECOMING DIS TURBED OVER THE PROMISED IMPAIRMENT THEREOF THE WHOLE PLAN IS ONE OF NATIONAL ENCOURAGEMENT OF INDUSTRIES IS THERE ANYONE IN THE LUNITED STATES SO CONFIDENT OF THIS COUNTRYS INDUSTRIAL LEADERSHIP AS TO ASSERT THAT THE WHOLESALE DEVELOPMENT OF THOSE LARGE AND CHEAP POWERS IN SWITZERLAND WILL NOT SERIOUSLY AFFECT OUR STATUS IN THE PRODUCTIVE WORLD  TRADE AND PRODUCTION ARE ENTIRELY COSMOPOLITAN THE CHEAPEST SOURCES OF ENERGY ARE GOING TO BE USED WITHOUT REFER SEE PAPER IN THIS VOLUME ON FEDERAL CONTROL OF WATER POWER IN SWITZERLAND BY TREADWELL CLEVELAND JR 543 59THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY ENCE TO ANY PARTICULAR FLAG IF THEY ARE LOCATED IN A REGION CONVENIENT TO MARKET THERE COULD BE FOUND NO POINT MORE ACCESSIBLE TO ALL THE GREAT MARKETS OF EUROPE THAN THE REPUBLIC OF SWITZERLAND NOR IS SWITZERLAND ALONE IN THIS PRACTICAL ADVANTAGE FRANCE IS MAKING AMAZING STRIDES IN WATERPOWER MATTERS AND THE APPRECIATION OF THE PUBLIC DUTY IN THIS RESPECT APPEARS TO BE MORE ACUTELY FELT THERE THAN IN ALMOST ANY OTHER COUNTRY THERE IS PROPER RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION OF WATER POWER HAS INTRODUCED A NEW AND FORCEFUL ELEMENT INTO THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF THE REPUBLIC WHEREAS BEFORE TRANSMISSION WATER POWER WAS A LOCAL MATTER APPURTENANT TO THE PARTICULAR SITE AT WHICH ITWAS LOCATED IT HAS BECOME A MATTER OF GENERAL AND SPECIAL UTILITY AND SHOULD BE SO TREATED IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF GOVERN MENT FRENCH LAW RELATIVE TO WATERPOWER DEVELOPMENT HAS RECEIVED CAREFUL CONSIDERATION DURING THE PAST FEW YEARS AND NEW CONCEPTS RELATIVE TO THE RIGHTS OF THE STATE HAVE BEEN ADOPTED THE FIRST PROPOSED REFORM CONSISTS OF THE GRANTING OF CONCESSIONS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF WATER POWER IN THE SAME MANNER AS CONCES SIONS ARE GRANTED FOR PUBLIC OR QUASIPUBLIC WORKS THESE CONCESSIONS BEING LIMITED TO A SPECIFIED TIME AND TO A SPECIFIED AMOUNT OF POWER THE PRINCIPLES PROPOSED AS A BASIS FOR THIS REFORM ARE FIRST THAT ALL THE VARIOUS USES OF WATER POWER MUST BE FACILITATED AND ENCOURAGED SIMULTANEOUSLY BECAUSE IT IS OF THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE TO DISTRIBUTE THE POWER PRODUCED AMONG THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF USES SECOND THAT ENGINEERS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL KINDS OF INTERESTS MUST BE ENCOURAGED TO MAKE STUDIES AND PROPOSITIONS AS TO COM BINATIONS AND PROJECTS OF EVERY NATURE RELATIVE TO THE BEST USES OF WATER POWER THIRD THAT THE POWER OF CONCESSION MUST BELONG TO THE STATE WHICH ALONE IS ABLE TO COMBINE ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION AND TO SETTLE DIFFICULTIES ARISING AMONG OPPOSING INTERESTS THE STATE IN THIS CASE BEING THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC THIS POWER OF CONCESSION IS TO BE EXERCISED IRRESPECTIVE OF ALL BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PREJUDICE IN THE SOLE EFFORT TO DERIVE THE GREATEST POSSIBLE AMOUNT OF BENEFIT IN EVERY CASE IN WHICH THERE IS NO GENERAL PUBLIC INTEREST THAT WOULD BE DAMAGED THEREBY AND ONLY IN SUCH CASE SUCH CONCESSION SHALL BE GRANTED IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER OF PREFERENCE TO THE PROVINCE TO THE COUNTY TO THE PRIVATE COM PANY THE FOURTH PRINCIPLE IS THAT THE TERM OF CONCESSION SHALL BE AS LIMITED AS POSSIBLE IN ORDER THAT MISTAKES OR DEFECTS MAY FROM 544 6OWATER POWER IN THE UNITED STATES TIME TO TIME BE CORRECTED AND THAT CHANGES MAY BE MADE TO CONFORM TO MODIFICATIONS IN CONDITIONS THE BROAD PROPOSAL BRIEFLY OUTLINED ABOVE INDICATES MERELY THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE IS ENTERING UPON A CAMPAIGN OF ENCOUR AGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF WATER POWERS WITH THE SOLE PURPOSE IN VIEW OF MAKING THE GREATEST POSSIBLE USE OF THIS ITS MOST IMPORT ANT SOURCE OF MECHANICAL ENERGY IT IS SIGNIFICANT THAT SO BROAD A PRINCIPLE OF PUBLIC CONTROL SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROPOSED AND IT IS TO BE ASSUMED THAT THE PROPOSAL WAS THE RESULT OF CAREFUL CONSIDERATION SUPPLEMENTED BY THE RIPE EXPERIENCE OF THE FAMOUS HYDRAULICIANS BOTH PAST AND PRESENT OF THAT COUNTRY GERMANY AUSTRIA ITALY SWEDEN AND NORWAY DO NOT LAG BE HIND FRANCE AND SWITZERLAND IN MAKING A BID FOR INDUSTRIAL LEADER SHIP THROUGH THE AGENCY OF WATER POWER NOT LONG SINCE NORWAY DIVERTED FROM THE UNITED STATES TO ITS OWN BORDERS A GREAT MANU FACTURING PLANT THE PRODUCT OF WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST NECESSARY COMMODITIES IN MODERN TRADE NECESSARY IN PEACE AND INDISPENSABLE IN WAR THE SOURCES FROM WHICH THE WORLD IS NOW SUPPLIED WITH THAT PRODUCT ARE FAILING AND THE PROCESS OF THIS GREAT COMPANY WILL ELIMINATE THOSE SOURCES FROM THE MARKET WHETHER THEY FAIL WITHIN A DECADE OR A CENTURY THE POSSESSION OF THAT INDUSTRY WITHIN OUR BORDERS WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN OF STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE BUT BE CAUSE PUBLIC POLICY IN THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF WATERPOWER DEVELOP MENT IN THE UNITED STATES IS NOT AS FAVORABLE AS THAT IN NORWAY THE INDUSTRY LOCATED THERE HAVING UTILIZED THE SITES THAT WERE CEDED TO IT BY THE NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT THIS COMPANY IS NOW SEEKING ANOTHER LOCATION ON WHICH IT IS PROPOSED TO MAKE A LARGER WATERPOWER DEVELOPMENT THAN HAS EVER BEEN COMPRISED IN A SINGLE UNIT OR GROUP OF UNITS THERE ARE IN THE UNITED STATES NUMEROUS SITES AT WHICH THIS DEMAND FOR POWER COULD BE SUPPLIED BUT THE SAME CONDITIONS PREVAIL HERE NOW AS PREVAILED AT THE TIME OF SELECT ING THE FIRST LOCATION EUROPEAN COUNTRIES KNOWING THE STRATEGIC VALUE OF THE PLANT IN TIME OF WAR ARE OFFERING INDUCEMENTS AND CON CESSIONS THE COMPANY FOR VARIOUS REASONS NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS PATRIOTISM WOULD PREFER TO LOCATE IN THE UNITED STATES BUT IT FINDS AMONG THE PEOPLE HERE NO DISPOSITION TO MEET THE CONDITIONS IMPOSED BY THE SITUATION AND AT THE PRESENT WRITING IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THE PLANT WOULD BE LOCATED IN EITHER GERMANY SWITZERLAND OR FRANCE IF OUR PEOPLE DO NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY 545THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY IT IS PROBABLE THAT AT SOME TIME IN THE FUTURE THE UNITED STATES WILL BE OBLIGED TO BUY THE MOST NECESSARY ELEMENT IN NATIONAL DEFENCE FROM AN UNFRIENDLY POWER OR THROUGH A MEDIATOR THERE ARE REAL DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY OF SECURING PROPER CONCESSIONS TO MEET SUCH AN EMERGENCY AS THIS THE COUNTRY THAT HAS ADOPTED A POLICY WILL ALWAYS HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF A COUNTRY LIKE OURS WHICH HAS NO POLICY SAVE THAT OF TOLERANCE AND LICENSE OF THE GREED OF INDIVIDUALS THERE IS MORE THAN ENOUGH WATER POWER IN THE UNITED STATES TO FULFIL EVERY WANT THAT MAYI REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO ARISE IN MANY GENERATIONS WHEN WE SUM UP OUR POWER RESOURCES AND TRY TO FIND OUT HOW LONG THEY WILL SERVE OUR FUTURE NEEDS WE MUST LOOK AT THE MATTER FROM A VIEWPOINT DIFFERENT FROM THAT TAKEN BY THE PROMOTER OF TO DAY HE IS SEEKING AN INVESTMENT THAT WILL RETURN A PROFIT AND THE ELEMENTS THAT ENTER INTO HIS CONSIDERATIONS ARE IMMEDIATE COST AND IMMEDIATE MARKET IT IS NOT PLEASING TO HIM TO INVEST IN A PLANT THAT PROMISES REMOTE PROFITS BUT HE SEEKS THE OPPORTUNE COMBINATION OF LEMAND AND SUPPLY VE ON THE OTHER HAND MUST HAVE IN MIND THE BROADER SUBJECT OF PUBLIC NECESSITY AND ECONOMY THEREFORE WHEN WE SAY THAT OUR AVAILABLE WATER POWER IS SO MUCH IT SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD THAT A PART OF THAT AMOUNT IS NOT SUITED FOR IMMEDIATE USE BUT WILL BECOME USEFUL WHEN OUR DEMANDS HAVE INCREASED TO A POINT AT WHICH THE HIGH COST OF INSTALLATION IS WARRANTED SOME DAY IN THE FUTURE THE WATERPOWER PRIVILEGES THAT WE NOW PASS WITH OUT A MOMENTS CONSIDERATION WILL BE PROFITABLY UTILIZED WITH THIS PRINCIPLE IN MIND LET US ESTIMATE THE EXTENT OF OUR POWER RESOURCES NO COMPLETE SURVEY HAS EVER BEEN MADE OF THE WATER POWERS OF THE UNITED STATES IN SOME PARTS THE FACTS ARE WELL KNOWN IN OTHERS WE HAVE ONLY APPROXIMATE DATA YET THAT WHICH IS HEREIN AFTER SET DOWN IS ACCURATE ENOUGH THE POWER AFFORDED BY ANY RIVER MAY BE STATED IN SEVERAL WAYS EACH OF WHICH IS SUBJECT TO INTERPRETATION RIVERS FLUCTUATE IN FLOW AND IT FOLLOWS THAT THE POWER MUST VARY ACCORDING TO THE FLUCTUATION THEREFORE IN STATING THE AVAILABLE POWER IT IS NECESSARY TO GIVE THE STAGE OF THE RIVER AT WHICH THE STATED AMOUNT MAY BE PRODUCED IT SHOULD BE PLAIN THAT THE MOST USEFUL POWER IS THAT WHICH WILL BE CONTINUOUS THROUGHOUT THE DRYEST YEAR AND THIS IS THE AMOUNT THAT WILL BE DEVELOPED BY 546 62WATER POWCER IN THE UNITED STATES THE LOWEST FLOW THE USUAL EXPRESSIONS FOR THE ENERGY SO PRODUCED ARE MINIMUM POWER OR PRIMARY POWER WHENEVER THE RIVER IS RUNNING ABOVE THE MINIMUM FLOW THE POWER THAT IT WILL DEVELOP IS INCREASED USUALLY THE PERIOD OF MINIMUM FLOW IS SHORT SOMETIMES CONTINUING FOR ONLY A WEEK OR TWO AND SELDOM DOES IT OCCUR FOR MORE THAN TWO OR THREE MONTHS IN HUMID REGIONS THEREFORE DURING THE GREATER PART OF THE YEAR THE RIVER WILL PRODUCE MORE THAN THE PRIMARY POWER THIS POWER IN EXCESS OF THE PRIMARY MAY OFTEN BE USED FOR PURPOSES THAT DO NOT REQUIRE POWER DURING THE ENTIRE YEAR WHEN FOR EXAMPLE A MANUFACTURING PLANT WHICH RUNS ONLY A PART OF THE YEAR CAN BE REGULATED IN OPERATION SO THAT THE PERIODS OF HIGH WATER MAY BE UTILIZED THEN THE USE OF THE POWER IN EXCESS OF THE PRIMARY IS OF GREAT VALUE THERE ARE MANY OTHER CONDITIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH EXCESS POWER MAY BE USED TO ADVANTAGE THE POWER IN EXCESS OF THE PRIMARY IS USUALLY TERMED SECONDARY POWER ONE OF THE IMPORTANT STUDIES PREVIOUS TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF POWER PLANTS IS THAT OF THE LIMIT TO WHICH SECONDARY POWER CAN BE ECONOMICALLY DEVELOPED IN SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY IT IS PROFITABLE TO INSTALL WHEELS AND APPURTENANCES TO DEVELOP POWER UP TO THAT WHICH WILL BE PRODUCED BY THE MINIMUM FLOW FOR THE FOUR MONTHS OF HIGHEST WATER IN THE YEAR IN OTHER PARTS IT IS NECESSARY TO DE VELOP TO THE MINIMUM FOR THE HIGHEST EIGHT OR TEN MONTHS IN ORDER TO WARRANT THE EXPENDITURE THE MARKET FOR SUCH POWER IS THE DECIDING FACTOR A FAIR AVERAGE LIMIT OF PROFITABLE INSTALLATION FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY IS REPRESENTED BY THE POWER CORRESPONDING TO THE MINIMUM FLOW FOR THE SIX HIGHEST MONTHS IN THE YEAR THIS FACTOR HAS BEEN USED IN THE FOLLOWING SCHEDULE THE THIRD BASIS FOR POWER STATEMENT IS THE TOTAL POWER WITH CONSERVATION THAT IS THE POWER WHICH MAY BE DEVELOPED IF THE UPLAND FLOODS ARE STORED IN RESERVOIRS AND HELD UNTIL NEEDED DURING DRY SEASONS IT IS PLAIN THAT SUCH A PROCEDURE WILL GREATLY INCREASE THE LOWWATER FLOW AND CORRESPONDINGLY INCREASE THE PRIMARY POWER AVAILABLE SUCH A PROCESS IS THE HIGHEST DEVELOPMENT OF A RIVER FOR USE IN ANY CAPACITY THE PRIMARY POWER SO DEVELOPED IS THE MAXI MUM THAT THE RIVER WILL FURNISH IN DEVELOPING THE FOLLOWING FIGURES CONSIDERATION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO MANY OF THE CONDITIONS THAT PRESCRIBE THE LIMITS OF POWER PRO DUCTION ON OUR RIVERS ESPECIALLY HAS THE SLOPE OF THE STREAM CHAN 547 63THE ANNALS OF THE AMLERICAN ACADEMY NELS BEEN SCRUTINIZED THE THEORETICAL ENERGY DEVELOPED BY A RIVER IS THAT WHICH WOULD BE PRODUCED BY THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF WATER THAT IT CARRIES IF IT SHOULD FALL A PERPENDICULAR DISTANCE EQUAL TO THE FALL OF THE RIVER FROM SOURCE TO MOUTH IT HAS NOT BEEN ASSUMED THAT EVEN UNDER IDEAL CONDITIONS OF MARKET ALL THEORETICAL POWER WILL EVER BE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE THE FLATTER PORTIONS OF RIVER CHANNELS CAN NEVER BE PROFITABLY DEVELOPED AND THEY HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN THE SCHEDULE IN ALL CASES THE ACTUALLY MEASURED FALL HAS BEEN REDUCED TEN PER CENT IN THE COMPUTATIONS A FURTHER REDUCTION OF TEN PER CENT HAS BEEN MADE TO COMPENSATE FOR WHEEL EFFICIENCY IT IS RECOGNIZED THAT NINETY PER CENT IS TOO HIGH A WHEEL EFFICIENCY TO BE USED IN CALCULATIONS OF POWER AT THE PRESENT TIME SEVENTYFIVE OR EIGHTY PER CENT BEING THE USUAL INSTALLATION MAXI MUM HERE AGAIN IT SHOULD BE RECALLED THAT WE ARE COMPUTING FOR FUTURE CONDITIONS AS WELL AS PRESENT ONES AND IT MAY CONFIDENTLY BE EXPECTED THAT WITH THE IMPROVEMENT OF TURBINES A GREATER PERCENT AGE OF THE THEORETICAL POWER WILL BE REALIZED ON THE SHAFT WE MAY EXPECT BEFORE LONG TO SECURE A NINETY PER CENT EFFICIENCY THE RIVERS HAVE BEEN DIVIDED INTO SECTIONS OF VARYING LENGTH DETERMINED BY CHANNEL SLOPE AND THE FALL AND FLOW OF EACH SECTION HAVE BEEN OBTAINED FROM THE BEST AVAILABLE SOURCES OF INFORMATION THE RECORDS OF STREAM FLOW COLLECTED BY THE WATER RESOURCES BRANCH OF THE GEOLOGICAL SURVEY HAVE ALMOST UNIFORMLY BEEN THE ONLY AVAILABLE RESORT ALTHOUGH ACKNOWLEDGMENTS SHOULD BE MADE TO THE STATE WATER SUPPLY COMMISSIONS OF NEW YORK AND PENNSYLVANIA THE STATE ENGINEERS OF NEW YORK COLORADO CALIFORNIA OREGON AND NEBRASKA THE TERRITORIAL

STATES 65 SARY AND IT IS BELIEVED FROM THE EXPERIENCE GAINED IN THE STUDY OF RIVERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THAT IT WILL BE FAIR AND CONSERVATIVE TO ASSUME THAT IF IN PRESENT COMPUTATIONS OF THE AMOUNT OF POWER WITH CONSERVATION ANY GIVEN STORAGE BE CONSIDERED AS DRAWN UPON UNIFORMLY DURING SIX MONTHS OF THE YEAR AND THE NATURAL FLOW FROM THE UNCONSERVED AREAS BE CONSIDERED AS SUFFICIENT TO MAINTAIN AT LEAST AN EQUAL FLOW DURING THE REMAINING SIX MONTHS THE RESULTS WILL NOT DEPART TOO WIDELY FROM THE ACTUAL CONDITIONS AS REGARDS TOTAL POWER THE FOLLOWING SCHEDULE IS THE RESULT OF THE PROCESS

REMARKABLE FEATURE OF THE FOREGOING TABLE IS THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE WATER POWER IN THE NORTHERN PACIFIC THIS AREA INCLUDES ALL THE PACIFIC COAST STREAMS NORTH 549 PRINCIPAL DRAINAGES INDICATED DRAINAGE OF POINTTHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY BONITA OR GOLDEN GATE IT INCLUDES THE SACRAMENTO RIVER AND ITS HIGHLAND TRIBUTARIES ALSO THE COLUMBIA RIVER THE LATTER IS BY FAR THE GREATEST WATERPOWER STREAM ON THE AMERICAN CONTINENT FEW PEOPLE LIVING WITHIN THE BASIN HAVE ANY ADEQUATE IDEA OF THE RESOURCES THERE AND THE REMAINDER OF THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY ARE PRACTICALLY IGNORANT EVEN OF THE GENERAL FACTS IN A COUNTRY AS GREAT AS THAT OF THE UNITED STATES AND IN WHICH WATER POWERS ARE SO ABUNDANT IT IS ASTONISHING TO FIND THAT ONETHIRD OF THE POWER RESOURCES ARE EXISTENT IN THIS PROPORTIONATELY SMALL AREA THE DRAINAGE NEXT IN SIZE FROM THE STANDPOINT OF WATER POWER IS THAT OF THE ST LAWRENCE IT IS NEEDLESS TO STATE THAT THE POWER RESOURCES AT NIAGARA WHICH INCLUDE THE CATARACT AND RAPIDS BELOW ADD MATERIALLY TO THE TOTAL FIGURE ALTHOUGH IN THE FOREGOING TABLE THE DRAINAGE AREA AND THE FLOW ARE GIVEN COMPLETE THE WATERPOWER FIGURES OUTSIDE OF NIAGARA AND THE ST LAWRENCE ITSELF INCLUDE ONLY THOSE POWERS WITHIN THE TERRITORY OF THE UNITED STATES THE TOTAL POWER AFFORDED BY NIAGARA RIVER WILL NEVER BE UTILIZED UNLESS AT SOME TIME IN THE FUTURE THERE IS A DEMAND FOR MECHANICAL ENERGY THAT TRANSCENDS OTHER CONSIDERATIONS STEPS HAVE ALREADY BEEN TAKEN BY THE UNITED STATES AND SIMILAR ACTION IS PROMISED BY THE DOMIN ION GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH A RESTRICTION IS PLACED ON THE PRODUC TION OF POWER SO THAT THE SCENIC BEAUTY OF THE FALLS WILL NOT BE DE STROYED HOWEVER PRAISEWORTHY THIS POLICY MAY BE IT WILL CERTAINLY GIVE WAY IF AT ANY TIME IN THE FUTURE NECESSITY DEMANDS THAT ALL THE NIAGARA POWER BE PLACED IN PRODUCTIVE USE OF COURSE THE CON TINGENCY IS REMOTELET US HOPE THAT IT MAY NEVER MATERIALIZE THE OTHER GREAT AREAS IN WHICH ENORMOUS POWER IS AVAILABLE ARE THE EASTERN AND WESTERN SLOPES OF THE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS THE EASTERN SLOPE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS AND COLORADO RIVER BASIN AN ENDEAVOR HAS BEEN MADE TO ESTIMATE THE POWER THAT MIGHT BE PRODUCED IF ALL STORAGE FACILITIES THAT WERE PRACTICABLY AVAILABLE WERE DEVELOPED TOPOGRAPHIC SURVEYS ON MANY OF THE BASINS MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO GIVE A FAIRLY CLOSE ESTIMATE BUT INASMUCH AS THREE FOURTHS OF THE COUNTRY HAS NOT BEEN SURVEYED IN THIS WAY THE ESTI MATES FOR THAT AREA MUST BE APPROXIMATE THERE ARE TWO METHODS BY WHICH SUCH AN ESTIMATE CAN BE MADE IN THE FIRST IT IS NECESSARY TO DETERMINE THE POWER WITH CONSERVATION IN THOSE PORTIONS OF THE COUNTRY COVERED BY ADEQUATE SURVEYS AND THEN TO ASSUME THAT IF THE AMOUNT SO SECURED REPRESENTS ONEFOURTH OF OUR TOTAL AREA THE 550 66WATER POWER IN THE UNITED STATES TOTAL POWER MUST BE APPROXIMATELY FOUR TIMES THAT AMOUNT AN EXAMINATION OF THE FACTS WILL READILY SHOW THAT THE AMOUNT SO OB TAINED WILL BE TOO SMALL IT IS APPARENT FROM A REVIEW OF THE INDEX MAP SHOWING THE AREAS COVERED BY TOPOGRAPHIC SURVEYS THAT A FAIRLY LARGE PROPORTION PROBABLY ONETHIRD COMPRISES COUNTRY IN WHICH THERE ARE NO FEASIBLE RESERVOIR SITES OR IN WHICH THEY ARE UNCOMMON IN OCCURRENCE SUCH PORTIONS INCLUDE LARGE PARTS OF THE DAKOTAS NEBRASKA KANSAS OKLAHOMA TEXAS AND LOUISIANA TOGETHER WITH GREAT AREAS ON THE ATLANTIC AND PACIFIC COASTAL PLAINS THEREFORE TO INCREASE THE TOTAL AVAILABLE WATER POWER FROM STORAGE THAT MAY BE COMPUTED ON SURVEYED PORTIONS BY THE RATIO OF TOTAL SURVEYED AREA TO THE AREA OF THE ENTIRE COUNTRY WOULD HARDLY DO JUSTICE TO THE SITUATION NEVERTHELESS THE FIGURES ARE HERE PRESENTED IT IS FOUND THAT THE TOTAL POWER WITH CONSERVATION AVAILABLE IN THE SURVEYED PORTIONS IS ABOUT 53000000 H P IF THIS BE CONSID ERED AS ONEFOURTH TO CORRESPOND WITH THE PROPORTION OF THE COUNTRY SURVEYED THE TOTAL POWER OF THE COUNTRY WITH PRACTICABLE MAXIMUM STORAGE WILL BE ABOUT 212000000 H P THE SECOND METHOD INVOLVES DETAILED STUDY OF THE PHYSIOGRAPHIC FEATURES OF THE COUNTRY THE TOPOGRAPHIC SURVEYS WHILE THEY COVER ONLY ONEFOURTH OF THE TOTAL AREA OF THE COUNTRY HAVE NEVERTHELESS BEEN PROSECUTED IN ALL SECTIONS AND ON ALL TYPES OF DRAINAGE AREA IF IT IS FOUND FOR EXAMPLE THAT OVER A CERTAIN PORTION OF THE COLOR ADO BASIN TOPOGRAPHIC SURVEYS REVEAL A CERTAIN FACTOR OF STORAGE THEN IT WILL BE FAIR TO ASSUME THAT IN EVERY PORTION OF THAT BASIN OF THE SAME PHYSIOGRAPHIC TYPE THE SAME FACTOR WILL ROUGHLY APPLY THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN EMPLOYED FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY AND WHILE THE RESULTS ARE BY NO MEANS SUFFICIENT FOR WORKING ESTIMATES THEY DO NEVERTHELESS ESTABLISH A FAIRLY DEFINITE AND REASONABLE LIMIT BY USING THIS METHOD THERE IS AFFORDED A GRAND TOTAL OF 230800000 H P THIS FIGURE AGREES SO CLOSELY WITH THAT OBTAINED BY THE FIRST METHOD THAT BOTH FIGURES ARE WORTHY OF SOME CONFIDENCE IN ANY CASE IT WILL BE FAIR TO ASSUME THAT WHEN ALL PRACTICABLE STORAGE SITES ARE UTILIZED AND THE WATER IS PROPERLY APPLIED THERE WILL BE EVENTUALLY DEVELOPED IN THE COUNTRY A TOTAL POWER EQUIVALENT TO AT LEAST 200000000 H P NO ONE CAN FIX THE DATE AT WHICH OUR PEOPLE WILL USE ALL THIS POWER THERE ARE INVOLVED TOO MANY UNCERTAIN FACTORS THE POTENCY OF WHICH IS EITHER TOTALLY UNKNOWN OR CAN MERELY BE APPROXIMATED 551 67THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY ONE WHO ATTEMPTS TO FIX ANY PRECISE OR EVEN APPROXIMATE DATE WILL ENCOUNTER THE FOLLOWING DIFFICULTIES FIRSTABOUT EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE POWER USED AT THE PRESENT TIME IS PRODUCED FROM FUEL THIS PERCENTAGE WILL DECREASE IN THE FUTURE UNTIL THE HIGH COST OF FUEL WILL FINALLY DRIVE FUEL POWER OUT OF THE MARKET THEREFORE IN SUMMING UP OUR FUTURE POWER UTILIZA TION WE MAY ASSUME THAT ALL THE POWER NOW AND HEREAFTER GENERATED FROM FUEL MAY BE DISREGARDED FOR IT WILL ALL FINALLY BE DISPLACED BY WATER POWER THE CURRENT INCREASE IN THE USE OF FUEL POWER IS ENOR MOUS AND MUST CONTINUE FOR SEVERAL DECADES AT LEAST THE GREAT WATERPOWER DEVELOPMENTS OF THE NEXT QUARTER CENTURY WILL BE DE SIGNED TO SUPPLY MECHANICAL ENERGY TO NEW MARKETS IN REGIONS AND PLACES NOW UNSUPPLIED RATHER THAN TO TAKE THE PLACE OF STEAM PLANTS ALREADY INSTALLED NO ONE EXPECTS TO SEE IN THE NEAR FUTURE ANY ACTUAL DECREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF STEAM POWER UTILIZED UNLESS PER CHANCE BY SOME HAPPY COMBINATION OF EVENTS THERE SHOULD BE BROUGHT ABOUT IN THE MINDS OF OUR PEOPLE A REALIZATION OF THINGS AS THEY OUGHT TO BE FEW MEN IN THIS GENERATION AT LEAST ARE POSSESSED OF SUFFICIENT ALTRUISTIC INSTINCTS TO INDUCE THEM TO GIVE UP THEIR STEAM PLANTS FOR THE SAKE OF THE ULTIMATE CONSERVATION OF OUR COAL RESOURCES BUT EVEN IF THIS WERE NOT SO THERE WOULD STILL BE ENOR MOUS UTILIZATION OF COAL THERE ARE GREAT CENTERS OF POWER UTILIZA TION WHICH UNDER THE PRESENT LIMITS OF ELECTRICAL TRANSMISSION AND CONVERSION CAN NOT BE SERVED BY WATER POWER BECAUSE THEY ARE SIT UATED TOO FAR FROM WATERPOWER SITES THEREFORE FUEL POWER IS NECESSARY AND WILL BE UTILIZED UNTIL ELECTRICAL TRANSMISSION HAS BEEN MADE MORE EFFICIENT ALL OF THIS BRINGS A FLUCTUATING FACTOR INTO THE PREDICTION CONCERNING THE SUFFICIENCY OF OUR WATER POWERS IN FUTURE YEARS THERE IS NO ESCAPE FROM A BROAD GENERALIZATION IN THIS MAT TER SECONDIT IS UNSAFE TO ESTIMATE THE FUTURE DEMAND FOR POWER FROM PAST UTILIZATION THE INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF POWER USED FOR MANUFACTURING PURPOSES DURING THE DECADE I8701880 WAS FORTY EIGHT PER CENT DURING THE NEXT DECADE IT WAS SEVENTYFOUR PER CENT FROM I890 TO I900 IT WAS SEVENTYFIVE PER CENT WHILE IN THE YEAR I9I0 THE INCREASE OVER THAT OF I900 PROMISES TO BE ABOUT EIGHTYFIVE PER CENT THERE IS AN INCREASING RATE OF INCREASE IN THE UTILIZATION OF POWER AT THE PRESENT TIME BUT THIS CAN NOT ALWAYS CONTINUE WHILE IT MAY BE THAT THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF POWER IN USE 552 68WATER POWER IN THE UNITED STATES 69 WILL INCREASE WITH EACH DECADE AND THAT EACH DECADES ACTUAL INCREASE WILL BE GREATER THAN THAT OF THE PRECEDING THE PERCENTAGE INCREASE MUST AFTER A WHILE BE LESS EACH DECADE JUST WHAT THIS RATE OF DECREASE WILL BE CAN NOT BE FORETOLD FOR IT IS DEPENDENT UPON SO MANY CHANGES IN METHODS AND PRODUCTION THAT IT TOO MUST BE LARGELY GENERALIZED THIRDBY WAY OF PARTIAL COMPENSATION FOR THE GROWING DE MAND UPON OUR POWER RESOURCES THERE IS THE ASSURED INCREASE IN EFFICIENCY WITH WHICH THAT POWER IS USED THIS IS MERELY ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING THAT WE SHALL ACCOMPLISH MORE IN THE FUTURE WITH ONE HORSE POWER THAN WE CAN TODAY THE LOSSES OF POTENTIAL POWER BETWEEN THE FALLING WATER AND THE APPLICATION OF THAT POWER AFTER TRANSMISSION TRANSFORMATION ETC TO PRODUCTIVE WORK ARE GREAT BUT NOT AS GREAT AS THEY WERE IN YEARS PAST THIS IMPROVEMENT WILL CONTINUE BUT NO ONE KNOWS HOW FAST AND THEREFORE ANOTHER UNCER TAIN ELEMENT ENTERS INTO ANY ESTIMATE OF THE SUFFICIENCY OF OUR WATER POWER RESOURCES IF IN THE USE OF OUR 2OO00000000OOO H P WE REDUCE THE LOSSES IN EFFICIENCY FROM FORTY PER CENT TO TEN PER CENT THE EFFECT WILL BE THE SAME AS THOUGH 60OOOOOO H P WERE ADDED TO OUR ULTIMATE RESOURCES ALL WE KNOW TODAY IS THAT ACCORDING TO OUR BEST CALCULATIONS WE HAVE OF AVAILABLE WATER POWER IN THE UNITED STATES SOMEWHAT MORE THAN SEVEN TIMES OUR PRESENT TOTAL POWER UTILIZATION CON SIDERING THE MATTER BROADLY WITH THE ABOVE FLUCTUATING FACTORS IN VIEW AS WELL AS MANY OTHERS NOT HERE DISCUSSED IT SEEMS SAFE TO PREDICT THAT OUR WATER POWER WILL BE SUFFICIENT FOR OUR NEEDS FOR AT LEAST SEVEN GENERATIONS HENCE THE WZATER POWER PLANTS IN THE UNITED STATES MAKE PRODUCTIVE USE OF ONLY FIVE AND ONEHALF MILLION HORSE POWERS AN AMOUNT WHICH IS LESS THAN ONEFORTIETH OF THAT ULTIMATELY AVAILABLE THE FOLLOWING TABLE CONTAINS A SUMMARY OF THE NUMBER OF WATERPOWER WHEELS AND THE HORSE POWER GENERATED IN EACH OF THE STATES OF THE UNION THE FIGURES ARE

WERE INSTALLED AT AN EARLY DATE WHEN SMALL UNITS WERE COMMON MORE RECENT PRACTICE HAS INVOLVED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF LARGER UNITS AND AS THE WESTERN INSTALLATIONS ARE ALL RECENT THIS PRACTICE TAKEN TOGETHER WITH THE EXISTENCE OF THE LARGER POWER PRIVILEGES GIVES THE RESULT THAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED FROM A GENERAL SURVEY OF THE SITUATION THE FIRST TABLE SHOWS THAT NEW YORK STATE HAS THE LARGEST

DESCRIPTION OF THE STRUCTURAL AND MECHANICAL FEATURES OF THE VARIOUS PLANTS THIS IN ITSELF WOULD REQUIRE MORE SPACE THAN HAS BEEN ALLOTTED TO THE PRESENT PAPER THE BEST THAT CAN BE DONE IS TO OUTLINE THE MOST NOTEWORTHY FEATURES WHICH TYPIFY THE VARIOUS SITUATIONS UNDER WHICH POWER PLANTS ARE DEVELOPED AND OPERATED THE WATER POWER AVAILABLE AT ANY PRIVILEGE DEPENDS PRINCIPALLV UPON TWO FACTORS FIRST THE AMOUNT OF FALL OR THE HYDROSTATIC HEAD ON THE WHEELS SECOND THE AMOUNT OF WATER THAT CAN BE TURNED OVER THE WHEELS WATER POWERS DEVELOPED IN THE UNITED STATES REPRESENT ALL SORTS OF COMBINATIONS OF FALL AND FLOW THE PARTICULAR TYPE DE PENDING ON THE NATURAL CONDITIONS AT THE VARIOUS SITES IN THE EARLIER POWERS IN NEW ENGLAND AND NEW YORK FOR EXAMPLE THE STATIC HEAD IS USUALLY LOW AND TO DEVELOP A GREAT AMOUNT OF POWER IT IS 557 73THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY NECESSARY TO DISCHARGE A LARGE VOLUME OF WATER UPON PROPERLY DE SIGNED WHEELS IN MANY OF THE MORE MODERN PLANTS OF THE WEST WHERE ONLY A SMALL AMOUNT OF WATER IS AVAILABLE THERE IS A GREAT FALL AS A RESULT WE MAY HAVE IN ONE PLACE A PLANT DEVELOPING SAY IO0000OOO H P WITH A FALL OF ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY TO FORTY FEET AND IN ANOTHER PLACE A PLANT OF THE SAME CAPACITY WITH A FALL OF IO000 I500 OR 2000 FEET IT IS OBVIOUS THAT IN THE ONE CASE THE LACK OF FALL IS COMPENSATED BY THE GREAT VOLUME OF WATER AND IN THE OTHER CASE THE CONVERSE CONDITIONS PREVAIL SO FAR AS THE USEFULNESS OF THE ENERGY IS CONCERNED IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHETHER THE POWER BE DEVELOPED BY THE ONE TYPE OF PLANT OR THE OTHER ALTHOUGH OF COURSE THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN THE APPLICATION OF THE WATER AND IN THE TYPE OF THE IMPLEMENTS OF POWER CONVERSION SO FAR AS ACTUAL ENERGY IS CONCERNED IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHETHER WE DEVELOP A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF POWER BY ALLOWING TEN CUBIC FEET OF WATER PER SECOND TO FALL ONE FOOT OR BY ALLOWING ONE CUBIC FOOT OF WATER PER SECOND TO FALL TEN FEET IN THE FOLLOWING DESCRIPTIONS OF POWER PLANTS THE DIFFERENT CONDITIONS OUTLINED ABOVE WILL BE ILLUSTRATED ST LAWRENCE POWER COMPANY2THIS PLANT IS OF A TYPE IN WHICH THE HEAD ON THE WHEELS IS LIMITED BUT THIS DEFICIENCY IS MADE UP BY THE USE OF A LARGE AMOUNT OF WATER IT IS ONE OF THE MORE RECENT LARGE POWER INSTALLATIONS IN THE EASTERN PART OF THE UNITED STATES AND WAS AT THE TIME OF ITS CONSTRUCTION THE LARGEST IN THE UNITED STATES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THAT AT NIAGARA THE FLOW OF ST LAWRENCE RIVER IS MORE NEARLY UNIFORM THAN THAT OF ANY LARGE RIVER ON THE AMERICAN CONTINENT ALL OF THE GREAT LAKES ACT AS STORAGE RESERVOIRS AND THEIR CAPACITY AND EXPANSE ARE SO GREAT THAT THE FLUCTUATIONS OF FLOW THAT ARE COMMON TO RIVERS NOT SO REGULATED ARE MINIMIZED IN THE VICINITY OF MASSENA NEW YORK THE ST LAWRENCE DE SCENDS OVER THE LONG SAULT RAPIDS THE TOTAL FALL IN A DISTANCE OF EIGHT MILES BEING FORTY FEET ABOUT THREE MILES SOUTH OF THE ST LAWRENCE GRASSE RIVER RUNS NEARLY PARALLEL THERETO AND ENTERS THE FORMER A SHORT DISTANCE BELOW THE FOOT OF THESE RAPIDS AS THE CHANNEL OF GRASSE RIVER LIES AT THIS POINT ABOUT FORTY FEET LOWER THAN THAT OF THE ST LAWRENCE AT THE HEAD OF LONG SAULT RAPIDS THERE ARE AFFORDED UNUSUALLY FAVORABLE NATURAL CONDITIONS FOR THE DEVELOP MENT OF A POWER PLANT ALL THAT IS NECESSARY FOR SUCH DEVELOPMENT 2ABSTRACTED FROM ENGINEERING NEWS FEB 21 1901 558 74LWATER POWER IN THE UNITED STATES IS THE CUTTING OF A CANAL OF LARGE CAPACITY ACROSS THE PLATEAU FROM THE HEAD OF LONG SAULT RAPIDS AND DROPPING THE WATER OVER WHEELS INTO GRASSE RIVER THE PLANS FOR THIS DEVELOPMENT AS ORIGINALLY LAID OUT PROVIDE FOR A CANAL I6200 FEET LONG 226J2 FEET WIDE AT THE WATER LINE AND 25 FEET DEEP LAID ON A GRADE THAT WILL PROVIDE A FLOW SUFFICIENT FOR THE GENERATION OF 75OOO H P THE FIRST STEP IN THE CON STRUCTION PROVIDES FOR THE UTILIZATION OF ONLY 35OO000 H P THE CANAL HAVING BEEN EXCAVATED MORE THAN HALF ITS FINAL WIDTH AT THE END OF THE CANAL A DAM AND POWER HOUSE OF MONOLITHIC CONCRETE HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTED IT IS ONE OF THE LARGEST EVER UNDERTAKEN IN THIS COUNTRY THE DAM IS A HEAVY WALL 8 FEET THICK AT THE WATER LEVEL AND 15 FEET THICK AT THE FLOOR OF THE TURBINE CHAMBERS THESE CHAM BERS ARE LOCATED ON THE BACK OF THE DAM AND ARE SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER BY WALLS 6 FEET THICK LAID AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE AXIS OF THE MAIN DAM THE CHAMBERS BETWEEN THESE WALLS ARE THIRTYTWC FEET IN WIDTH AND EACH CONTAINS THREE DOUBLE HORIZONTAL TURBINES MOUNTED ON A COMMON SHAFT EACH SHAFT PIERCES THE WALL OF THE TURBINE CHAMBER AND ENTERS THE DYNAMO ROOM AND UPON EACH IS MOUNTED A 5000 H P GENERATOR EACH SINGLE TURBINE HAS A NORMAL CAPACITY OF TOOO H P WHEN WORKING AT A MINIMUM NET HEAD OF THIRTYTWO FEET THE GENERATORS ARE ALTERNATINGCURRENT ROTATING FIELD MACHINES DEVELOPING 5000 H P EACH AT A POTENTIAL OF 22000 VOLTS AT THE TIME THE PLANT WAS CONSTRUCTED THERE WAS LITTLE OR NO MARKET FOR THE POWER IN THE VICINITY OF MASSENA AND IT WAS THE EXPECTATION OF THE PROMOTERS OF THE COMPANY THAT THE ERECTION OF A POWER SO CHEAP AND EFFICIENT AT THIS PLACE WOULD ATTRACT THE LOCA TION OF SUFFICIENT INDUSTRIES SUCH AS PULP AND PAPER CHEMICALS ETC TO RETURN A PROFIT ON THE INVESTMENT THE PLANT IS THEREFORE ONE OF MANY IN THE UNITED STATES CONSTRUCTED IN ANTICIPATION OF MARKET RATHER THAN BY REASON OF A MARKET ALREADY IN EXISTENCE SOUTHERN POWER COMPANY3THE SOUTHERN POWER COMPANY ORGANIZED JUNE 20 I905 IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A CONSOLIDATION OF WATERPOWER INTERESTS WHICH APPEARS TO BE NECESSARY FOR THE ECO NOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF WATER POWERS IN MANY PARTS OF THE COUNTRY QUITE APART FROM ALL QUESTIONS RELATING TO THE MUCH DISCUSSED PROB LEM OF INDUSTRIAL CONSOLIDATION THERE IS A PHYSICAL ELEMENT GOVERN CONSTRUCTION DETAILS ABSTRACTED FROM ENGINEERING RECORD MAY 18 1907 559 75THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY ING THE DEVELOPMENT AND UTILIZATION OF WATER POWERS WHICH DEMANDS THAT A LARGE NUMBER OF POWERS WITHIN CERTAIN REGIONS HAVE A COM MON INTEREST THE SOUTHERN POWER COMPANY FOR EXAMPLE HAS ITS FIELD OPERATION IN THE PIEDMONT SECTION OF THE CAROLINAS IN LOWER NORTH CAROLINA AND UPPER SOUTH CAROLINA WITHIN THIS SECTION THE AGGREGATE AVAILABLE WATER POWER IS LARGE BUT THE SEVERAL UNITS MAK ING UP THAT AGGREGATE ARE COMPARATIVELY SMALL THE ELECTRICAL TRANS MISSION OF POWER OVER LONG DISTANCES HAS CHANGED THE WHOLE INDUS TRIAL ASPECT OF THE MATTER WHERE FORMERLY A WATER POWER WAS UTILIZED AT THE SITE AND INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENTS PROCEEDED THERE TO THE FULL CAPACITY OF THAT PARTICULAR POWER THERE WAS LITTLE OR NO INDUCEMENT TO COMBINE SEVERAL SITES IN OTHER WORDS THE SITES WERE INDEPENDENT IN OPERATION NOW THE SITE OF A WATER POWER IS NOT LIKELY TO BE ITS FIELD OF OPERATION BUT THE POWER IS DISTRIBUTED OVER A LARGE AREA IN THIS LARGE AREA THERE IS A COMMON DEMAND FOR POWER THE MARKET ITSELF CONSTITUTES AN ADMINISTRATIVE UNIT THE DEMAND OF THE REGION IS A DEMAND IN THE AGGREGATE AND MOREOVER IT IS A DEMAND THAT MUST BE SUPPLIED WHETHER OR NOT THE POWER AT ANY PARTICULAR POINT IS ABUNDANT OR SCANTY IT IS A WELLKNOWN FACT THAT A CERTAIN PRIVILEGE MAY NOW PRODUCE ABUNDANT POWER AND AGAIN MAY NOT PRODUCE SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE NORMAL DEMANDS IF THE INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY OF ANY PARTICULAR CENTRE IS DEPENDENT UPON THAT POWER IT SHOULD BE CLEAR THAT THE UNCERTAINTIES OF SECURING POWER THAT WOULD ARISE IF ONLY ONE SITE WERE UTILIZED WOULD SURELY INHIBIT PRODUCTIVE DEVELOPMENT AT THAT PLACE WHEN HOWEVER WE COMBINE A NUMBER OF SITES ON A NUMBER OF DRAINAGE AREAS POWER SUPPLY WILL BE COMPARATIVELY STEADY IF THE POWER AVAILABLE AT A CERTAIN SITE AND AT A PARTICULAR TIME IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO MEET A CERTAIN DEMAND THEN THE AVAILABLE POWER AT A COMBINATION OF SITES MAY BE SUFFICIENT THERE IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION AT ONE POINT A CER TAIN AMOUNT OF POWER MAY BE URGENTLY REQUIRED AT A CERTAIN TIME WHILE AT ANOTHER POINT THE URGENT DEMAND MAY BE AT A DIFFERENT TIME SO THAT IN ADDITION TO A VARYING SUPPLY THERE IS A VARYING DEMAND THIS MAKES IT NECESSARY TO JOIN TOGETHER MANY VARYING SOURCES OF POWER IN ORDER THAT THE SUPPLY MAY BE STEADY WHATEVER MAY BE THE LOCAL FLUCTUATIONS THEREIN THE PRINCIPLE IS ENTIRELY SIMILAR TO THAT IN WHICH A COMPANY OR AN INDIVIDUAL HAVING LARGE CASH ASSETS AND URGENT CALLS FOR MONEY DISTRIBUTES THOSE ASSETS IN SEVERAL BANKS WITH THE 560 76WATER POWER IN THE UNITED STATES RESULT THAT IN TIME OF FINANCIAL DEPRESSION IF ONE BANK SUSPENDS THERE IS IN ANOTHER DEPOSITORY A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF CALL MONEY TO INSURE THE CONTINUANCE OF THE BUSINESS IN OTHER WORDS THE DE MAND FOR POWER AND THE UTILIZATION THEREOF ARE SUCH THAT IT IS FATAL TO HAVE ALL THE EGGS IN ONE BASKET THIS SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS A PLEA FOR OR A JUSTIFICATION OF INDEFINITE POWER CONSOLIDATION THAT SUBJECT IS NOT IN THE PROVINCE OF THIS PAPER IT SHOULD ON THE CON TRARY BE REGARDED MERELY AS AN EXPRESSION OF THE REQUIREMENTS IM POSED BY NATURES LAWS THE ORIGINAL FIELD OF THE SOUTHERN POWER COMPANY INCLUDED TEN WATERPOWER SITES IN THE BASINS OF THE BROAD AND WATEREE RIVERS THE AGGREGATE HORSE POWER AVAILABLE BEING ABOUT 130000 OF WHICH THE LARGEST UNIT THAT AT THE GREAT FALLS OF THE CATAWBA HAS A CAPACITY OF

ALL OF THESE POWERS ARE OF COMPARATIVELY LOW HEAD ONE OF THE TYPICAL ONES THAT AT THE GREAT FALLS OF THE CATAWBA WILL BE DESCRIBED THE GREAT FALLS OF THE CATAWBA COVER ABOUT EIGHT MILES OF THAT RIVER THE FALL IN THAT DISTANCE BEING I76 FEET THE PLAN ADOPTED BY THE SOUTHERN POWER COMPANY CONTEMPLATES THE UTILIZATION OF THE FALL OF THREE PLANTS WHICH WILL UTILIZE SIXTY SEVENTYTWO AND FORTY FEET RESPECTIVELY THE MINIMUM FLOWS AT THE THREE PLANTS BEING 2220 2I00 AND 1950 CUBIC FEET PER SECOND RESPECTIVELY THE RESULTING POWERS ALLOWING EIGHTY PER CENT EFFICIENCY ON THE WHEELS ARE AP PROXIMATELY I2000 I4000 AND 7000 RESPECTIVELY THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE MIDDLE DEVELOPMENT OR THE ONE HAVING THE HEAD OF SEVENTY TWO FEET IS AS FOLLOWS AT THE HEAD OF THESE FALLS THE RIVER CHANNEL IS DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS BY MOUNTAIN ISLAND ACROSS ONE OF THESE CHANNELS AT THE HEAD OF THE ISLAND AN OVERFLOW DIVERSION DAM IS ERECTED WHICH IN TIMES OF LOW WATER DEFLECTS ALL OF THE FLOW INTO THE OTHER CHANNEL THE MAIN DAM AT THE HEADWORKS IS LOCATED ACROSS THIS CHANNEL NEAR THE FOOT OF MOUNTAIN ISLAND AND FROM THENCE THE POWER CANAL CON 56  7778 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADLEMY DUCTS THE WATER NEARLY ONE AND ONEHALF MILES TO THE TAILRACE WHICH IS LOCATED NEAR ROCKY CREEK A TRIBUTARY THAT ENTERS THE CATAWBA BELOW THE FALL HERE IMMEDIATELY UTILIZED THIS ARRANGEMENT WAS LARGELY ADJUSTED TO CONFORM WITH THE NATURAL GRADE LINES THERE EXIST ING THE COURSE OF THE CANAL BEING A NATURAL VALLEY AND A COMPARA TIVELY SMALL AMOUNT OF EXCAVATION WAS NECESSARY AT THE POWER STATION THE WATER IS PASSED OVER EIGHT WHEELS AND TWO EXCITER TUR BINES THROUGH STEEL PENSTOCKS WITH SUITABLE REGULATING WORKS THE EIGHT LARGE TURBINES WERE REQUIRED UNDER THE CONTRACT TO FURNISH 5200 H P EACH AT 225 REVOLUTIONS PER MINUTE UNDER A HEAD OF SEVENTYTWO FEET THE DISCHARGE FROM THESE TURBINES IS CONDUCTED INTO THE TAILRACE BETWEEN PIERS SUPPORTING THE POWER HOUSE THE ANIMAS CANAL RESERVOIR WATER POWZER COMPANY4THIS PLANT IS LOCATED IN SAN JUAN COUNTY SOUTHERN COLORADO IT IS TYPICAL OF MANY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND ESPECIALLY IN THE WEST WHICH ARE BUILT IN ADVANCE OF A DEMAND FOR FULL CAPACITY OF THE POWER PRIVILEGE IN SUCH PLACES WHERE A MARKET MUST BE CREATED IT IS THE USUAL PRACTICE TO DEVELOP ONLY A PART OF THE POWER AVAILABLE AND TO BUILD CERTAIN OF THE APPURTENANT WORKS OF LOWCOST MATERIALS THUS THE FIRST COST OF THE PLANT IS REDUCED TO A POINT AT WHICH THE SMALL INITIAL BUSINESS MAY PAY FOR THE FIXED CHARGES AND POSSIBLY RETURN SOME DIVIDENDS IN THIS WAY THE PLANT BECOMES SELFSUPPORT ING WHILE THE MARKET GROWS FROM TIME TO TIME THE TEMPORARY STRUCTURES ARE REPLACED BY PERMANENT ONES AND ULTIMATELY THE FULL POWER OF THE PRIVILEGE IS DEVELOPED THE ANIMAS PLANT IS ONE OF THE TYPE THAT UTILIZES A SMALL AMOUNT OF WATER OVER A HIGH HEAD THE POWER BEING RECOVERED ON IMPULSE WHEELS THE WATER FOR THE FIRST INSTALLATION WAS TAKEN FROM CASCADE CREEK A TRIBUTARY OF ANIMAS RIVER FROM THERE IT IS CONDUCTED BY

WILL ONE DAY BE REPLACED BY A MASONRY STRUCTURE OF NEARLY TWICE THE PRESENT HEIGHT FROM THIS STORAGE RESERVOIR THE WATER IS CONDUCTED BY ANOTHER WOODEN FLUME ABOUT ONE AND ONEQUARTER MILES LONG TO AN INTAKE BASIN AND FROM THIS THE WATER IS DELIVERED THROUGH STEEL CON DUIT UPON PELTON WHEELS AT A STATIC HEAD OF ABOUT IOOO FEET THE AMOUNT OF WATER REQUIRED BY THE FIRST INSTALLATION IS EIGHTY 4ABSTRACTED FROM ENGINEERING NEWS OF JAN 4 1906 562WATER POWER IN THE UNITED STATES SEVEN CUBIC FEET PER SECOTID AND THE POWER DEVELOPED IS FROM 6O000 TO 8OOO H P FUTURE ADDITIONS TO THE WATER SUPPLY WILL PROVIDE FOR AN ULTIMATE DEVELOPMENT OF 38OOO H P THE INTAKE BASIN STEEL CONDUIT AND POWERHOUSE APPURTENANCES ARE PERMANENT STRUCTURES AS DISTINGUISHED FROM ALL THAT PORTION OF THE WORKS ABOVE THE INTAKE BASIN THE ONLY CHANGE NECESSARY IN THESE LOWER WORKS IN CASE OF INCREASED CAPACITY OF PLANT WILL BE ADDITIONAL INSTALLATION OF CONDUITS WHEELS GENERATORS ETC THE FIRST INSTALLATION CONSISTED OF TWO PELTON WHEELS EACH OF 3000 H P CAPACITY UNDER NORMAL DELIVERY BUT SO ADJUSTED THAT THEY MAY BE MADE TO DEVELOP 4000 H P EACH THEY ARE EIGHT FEET IN DIAMETER AND NORMALLY OPERATE AT 300 REVOLUTIONS PER MINUTE THE ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT CONSISTS OF TWO REVOLVING FIELD THREEPHASE SIXTYCYCLE ALTERNATORS EACH OF 2250 KILOWATTS CAPACITY THEY AFFORD A VOLTAGE OF 4000 WHICH CURRENT IS TRANSFORMED TO 50OOO BY SIX WATERCOOLED OIL TRANSFORMERS EACH OF 750 KILOWATTS CAPACITY THE CURRENT IS TRANSMITTED OVER THREE CABLES EACH OF WHICH CONSISTS OF SIX ALUMINUM NO 8 B  S WIRES WITH A HEMP CORE THE POWER IS TRANSMITTED TWENTYFIVE MILES TO DURANGO AND SILVERTON THE SNOQUALMIE FALLS WATER POWER PLANT WASHINGTON STATE5 THIS IS A CATARACT POWER THOSE HERETOFORE DESCRIBED ARE OF A TYPE REQUIRING CONSTRUCTION OF LONG CANALS OR FLUMES THE SNOQUALMIE FALLS POWER TAKES ADVANTAGE OF A VERTICAL DROP IN THE CHANNEL OF THAT RIVER AMOUNTING TO ABOUT 270 FEET IN THIS RESPECT THE PRIVILEGE RESEMBLES THAT AT NIAGARA WE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO CONSIDER THAT NIAGARA FALLS DEVELOPS THE GREATEST CATARACT HEAD IN THE COUNTRY YET THE VERTICAL DROP THERE THAT HAS BEEN UTILIZED FOR POWER PRODUC TION IS ONLY 153 FEET THE SNOQUALMIE PLANT IS INTERESTING IN MANY RESPECTS THE USUAL PROCEDURE IN INSTALLING POWER PLANTS ON SUCH CATA RACTS IS TO DIVERT THE WATER BY MEANS OF SUITABLE CONDUITS EITHER IN TUNNEL BENEATH THE CLIFFS OR DOWN THE OUTSIDE THEREOF TO THE POWER HOUSE ERECTED ABOVE GROUND AT THE FOOT OF THE CATARACT IN THE PRESENT CASE THE WATER IS DIVERTED BY SUITABLY ARRANGED HEADWORKS INTO A CONDUIT SET IN A VERTICAL SHAFT THAT DESCENDS INTO THE CLIFF A SHORT DISTANCE ABOVE THE CREST OF THE FALLS IN OTHER WORDS A HOLE IS MADE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE RIVER AT THAT POINT AND THE WATER IS LET DOWN INTO A CHAMBER EXCAVATED IN THE SOLID ROCK TO THE HIGH WATER 5ABSTRACTED FROM ENGINEERING NEWS DEC 13 1900 563 79THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY LEVEL OF THE POOL BELOW THE FALLS THIS SHAFT IS TEN BY TWENTYSEVEN FEET IN CROSSSECTION AREA AND 270 FEET DEEP BEGINNING AT THE FOOT OF THE SHAFT AND EXTENDING HORIZONTALLY A CHAMBER 200 FEET IN LENGTH FORTY FEET WIDE AND THIRTY FEET HIGH WAS EXCAVATED IN THIS CHAMBER THE WHEELS AND ELECTRICAL APPARATUS ARE INSTALLED THE TAILRACE CONSISTS OF A TUNNEL EXCAVATED BELOW THE FLOOR OF THE MA CHINERY CHAMBER TWELVE FEET WIDE AND TWENTYFOUR FEET HIGH AND EXTENDIFIG OUTWARD TO THE FOOT OF THE FALLS THUS THE ENTIRE GENERAT ING PLANT IS CONCEALED AND THE ONLY EVIDENCE TO THE CASUAL OBSERVER OF THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH A PLANT IS THE STRUCTURE AT THE HEADWORKS AND THE OPENING OF THE TAILRACE TUNNEL AT THE FOOT OF THE CLIFF THE CONDUIT THAT CONDUCTS THE WATER FROM THE SURFACE EXTENDS ALONG THE TOP OF THE MACHINERY CHAMBER AND FROM IT BRANCHES ARE TAKEN LEAD ING TO THE WHEELS THIS CONDUIT OR PENSTOCK IS A STEEL PIPE SEVEN AND ONEHALF FEET IN DIAMETER THE BRANCHES LEADING THEREFROM TO THE WHEELS ARE FITTED WITH GATE VALVES WEIGHING 23000 POUNDS EACH AND WERE AT THE TIME OF INSTALLATION THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD THE GENERATING PLANT CONSISTS OF FOUR ELECTRICAL GENERATORS EACH DRIVEN BY A DOBLE WATER MOTOR OF 2500 H P CAPACITY THIS MOTOR CONSISTS OF A SHAFT CARRYING TANGENTIAL JET WHEELS AND THE WATER IS CONDUCTED UNDER PRESSURE AGAINST THE FLANGES BY TWO NOZZLES TO EACH WHEEL THESE NOZZLES BEING SO PLACED THAT THE TWO JETS OF WATER ARE DELIVERED AGAINST THE WHEEL FLANGES AT RIGHT ANGLES TO EACH OTHER EACH WHEEL UNIT WEIGHS ABOUT I00000 POUNDS THE ELECTRICAL GEN ERATORS ARE OF 1500 KILOWATT CAPACITY EACH THEY ARE OF THE REVOLV ING ARMATURE TYPE DELIVERING A THREEPHASE CURRENT AT I000 VOLTS 7200 ALTERNATIONS THE TRANSFORMER HOUSE IS ABOVE GROUND AT THE HEAD OF THE SHAFT THE CURRENT IS RECEIVED AT AN INITIAL VOLTAGE OF I000 AND IS RAISED TO 30000 THE POWER IS TRANSMITTED TO SEATTLE TACOMA AND EVERETT AT DISTANCES OF THIRTYTWO FORTYFOUR AND THIRTYFIVE MILES RESPECTIVELY THE TRANSMISSION CIRCUITS ARE OF STRANDED ALUMINUM CABLES AND THIS WAS THE FIRST INSTANCE OF THE USE OF THIS METAL IN LONGDISTANCE TRANSMISSION THESE WIRES STOP AT THE CITY LIMITS OF SEATTLE TACOMA AND EVERETT AND COPPER IS USED BEYOND THESE POINTS THE ULTIMATE CAPACITY OF THE PLANT IS ABOUT I00000 H P AND THE FLOW OF THE RIVER AT ITS LOWEST STAGE IS ABOUT I000 CUBIC FEET PER SECOND IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THE ULTIMATE POWER CAPACITY IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO CONSTRUCT RESERVOIRS IN THE CASCADE RANGE AT THE 564 80WATER POWER IN THE UNITED STATES HEAD OF SNOQUALMIE RIVER AND SITES FOR SUCH RESERVOIR SYSTEMS ARE ABUNDANT CONSTRUCTION ON THIS PLANT WAS BEGUN APRIL I7 I898 AND IT WAS PUT INTO OPERATION ON JULY 3I I899 CONCLUSION A FEW OF THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES GOVERNING WATER POWER DEVELOPMENT HAVE BEEN REVIEWED SOME OF THE BROADER CON SIDERATIONS RELATING TO THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF THE PRODUCTION AND USE OF MECHANICAL ENERGY HAVE BEEN CITED THERE IS MUCH MORE THAT MIGHT BE SAID THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE PAPER HAS BEEN TO EMPHA SIZE THE FACT THAT THE WATER POWERS OF THIS COUNTRY HAVE A HIGHER ULTIMATE SIGNIFICANCE THAN IS GENERALLY CONCEDED TO THEM AND THAT THEY ARE CERTAIN TO HAVE A DOMINATING EFFECT UPON THE MATERIAL PROGRESS AND THE INTEGRITY OF THIS REPUBLIC IF WE ARE TO PLACE OURSELVES IN AN ECONOMIC POSITION IN WHICH WE MAY FINALLY PREVAIL AS A WORLD POWER OUR POINT OF VIEW REGARDING FUEL AND WATER POWER MUST BE CHANGED AND OUR POLICIES MUST BE ALTERED SO THAT WE MAY WISELY PREPARE TO USE THE VAST POWER RESOURCES WHICH WE ARE NOW NEGLECTING 565 8I

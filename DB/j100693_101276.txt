Padua and Joh Baptista Riccioli Fesuite as it was communicated out of their lately Printed Books by that Learned Mathematician Mr Jacob Gregory a Fellow of the R Society RIccioli in his Almagestum Novum pretends to have found out several new demonstrative Arguments against the Motion of the Earth Steph de Angelis conceiving his Arguments to Gggg be694 be none of the strongest taketh occasion to let the world see that they are not more esteemd in Italy than in other places Man fredi in behalf of Riccioli endeavours to answer the Objections of Angeli and this latter replyes to Manfredis Answer The substance of their discourse is this following Although the Arguments of Riccioli be many yet the strength of them consists chiefly in these three The first Multa corpora gravia dimissa per Aerem in Plano AEquatoris existentem descenderent ad Terram cum Velocitat is Incremento reali  notabili  non tantum apparenti Sed si tellus moveretur motu diurno tantum circa sui centram nulla corpora gravia dimissa per Aerem in Plano Aequatoris existentem descenderent ad Terram cum vclocitatis incremento reali ac notabili sed tantum cum appa renti E Tellus aut non movetur aut non movetur diurno tantum motu The second Si Tellus moveretur motu diurno aut ctiam annuo multo debi lior esset ietus Globi bombardici explosi in Septentrionem aut Meri diem quam ab Occidente in Orientem At consequens est falsum E  antecedens The Third Si Tellus diurns revolutione moveretur Globus argillaceus un ciarum 8 ex altitudine Romanorum pedum 240 per acrem quietum dimissus obliquo descensu in Terram delaberetur absque incremento reali ac physico velocitatis vel certe nunquam tanto quanta est proportio percuionis ac soni per casum ex dicta altitudine facti Sed posterius est absurdum E  prius In Answer to the first of these Arguments Angeli denieth the Minor which Riccioli pretends to prove thus Si695 Si Tellus moveretur solo diurno motu aliquod Grave dimissum ex Turris vertice C in Plano AEquatoris existentis describeret suo motu naturali portionem linea CTI quae esset ad omnem sensum circularis V Fig I This Angeli denies shewing by Computation that Riccioli his Observation proveth no such thing For saith Angeli accord ing to Riccioli in one second of an hour the weight descends 15 foot in 2 seconds 60 foot in 3 seconds 135 foot and so continually the spaces from the beginning are in duplicate pro portion of the Time from the beginning and according to the G g g g 2 same Fig 1 D L H G F C X V T S I R J P O B Fig 2 M E A B G H C D E F A696 same Author AB the semidiameter of the Earth is of 25870000 foot and BC the height of the Tower of the Asi nelli in Bononia of 240 foot and therefore AC is 25870240 which hath the same proportion to FS 15 foot to wit ye fall in one second which AC in parts 20000000000 hath to FS 11596 54356 but supposing with Riccieli CSIA a semicircle 224189 FS is 53 parts of which AC is 10000000000 Hence conclu deth Angeli that CSIA is no wayes near to a semicircle which is most sure if so be the weight fall not to the Center of the Earth precisely in 6 hours For in this case of Riccioli the weight falls to the Center of the Earth in 21 minutes and 53 seconds Manfredi in his Answer for Riccioli affirms that Angeli understands not the Rule of Three in giving out FS for 11596 54356224189 of which AC is 20000000000 And Angeli in his Reply affirms his Analogy to be so clear that there can be nothing said more evident than it self to confirm it referring in the mean time the further determination to Geometers Angeli might have answerd Ricciolis Argument granting the weight to move equally in a semicircle by distinguishing his Minor thus Nulla Corpora gravia descenderent ad Terram cum velocitatis incremento reali ac notabili si Velocitas computetur in circum ferentia semicirculi Minor propositio est vera At non computatur ita Motus descensivus nam hic motus aequalis in circumferentia semicirculi CIA componitur ex motu aequali in quadrante CD  motu accelerato in semidiametro mobili CA  hic motus ac celeratus in semidiametro est verus  simplex motus descensivrs in qua acceptione Minor propositio est falsissima  Riccioli etiam experientiis contraria But it seems that Angeli answereth other wise to make Riccioli sensible that CIA is no semicircle con cerning the nature of which Line they debate very much through out the whole discourse The second Argument is much insisted upon by Angeli to make his solution clear to vulgar capacities but the substance of all is That the Canonball hath not only that violent motion impressed by the Fire but also all these motions proper to the Earth which were recommunicated to it by the impulse received from the Earth for697 for the Ball going from West to East hath indeed two impulses one from the Earth and another from the Fire but this impulse from the Earth is also common to the mark and therefore the Ball hits the mark only with that simple impulse received from the Fire as it doth being shot towards the North or South as Angeli doeth excellently illustrate by familiar examples of Motion To Riccioli his third Argument Angeli answereth desiring him to prove the sequel of his Major which Riccioli doeth supposing the curve in which the heavy body descends to be composed of many small right lines and proving that the motion is almost always equal in these lines and after some debate concerning the equality of motion in these right lines Angeli answers that the equality of motion is not sufficient to prove the equality of percussion and sound but that there is necessary also equal angles of incidence which in this case he proveth to be very unequal To illustrate this more let us prove that other things being alike the proportion of two percussions is composed of the direct proportion of their velocities and of the direct proportions of the Sines of their angles of incidence Supponamus autem sequens principium nempe quod percussiones caeteris paribus sint in direct a propor tione cum velocitatibus quibus mobile appropinquat planum resistens Fig 2da Sit planum CF sintque duo mobilia omni modo aequalia  similia quae

mobile prioribus simile  aequale moveri aequaliter in recta AC eadem velocitate qua movetur mobile in recta AD quoniam plana BGH CF sunt Parallela  motus in recta AC est  igitur mobile eadem ve locitate accedit ad planum BH qua ad planum CF  proinde per cussiones in punctis BC sunt aequales atque percussio in puncto D est ad percussionem in puncto B ut recta AE ad rectam AH sen ob aequales rectas AD AB ut sinus anguli ADE ad sinum anguli ABH quod sic probo velocitas mobilis in recta AD est aequalis velo698 velocitati mobilis in recta AB ipsi AD equali  ideo eodem tem pore perficitur utraque recta AD AB  proinde eodem tempore perficiuntur accessiones adplanaresistentia AE AH ideoque velo citates accessionum ad plana resistentia sunt in directa ratione AE ad AH atque ideo percussio in puncto D est ad percussionem in puncto C in eadem ratione AE ad AH nempe ut Sinus anguli incidentiae ADE ad sinum anguli incidentiae ACE vel AFE Quoniam autem rectae AC AF aequaliter inclinant ad planum CF mobilia in rectis AC AF accedunt ad planum CF in eadem proportione qua moventur in rectis AC AF  ideo percussio in C est ad percussionem in F in ratione velocitatis motus in AC seu in AD ad velocitatem motus in AF At demonstratum est ante percussionem in puncto D ad percussionem in puncto C esse in ratione sinus an guli ADE ad sinum anguli AFE  nunc demonstratum est per cussionem in puncto C esse ad percussionem in puncto F ut velocitas motus in AD ad velocitatem motus in AF Igitur ex 5 defin 6 Ele mentorum percussio in D est ad percussionem in Fin ratione compo sita exratione

aequalibus in lineis rectis  planis re sistentibus est enim vera in omni casu nam cumpercussiones fiant in puncto in hoc coincidunt rectum curvum aequale  inaequale si autem in punctis percussiones

geometricae corpori physico appli cantur In Angeli his reply to Manfreddi he maketh mention of an Experiment which as was related to him by a Swedish Gentle man had been made with all due circumspection by Cartesius to prove the Motion of the Earth The experiment was He caused to be erected a Canon perpendicular to the Horizon which be ing 24 times discharged in that posture the Ball did fall 22 times towards the West and only twice toward the East An

J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,108075,OBSERVATIONS ON THE TORPEDO WITH AN ACCOUNT OF SOME ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS ON ITS ELECTRICITY,I206989, 531  XXIV OBSERVATIONS ON THE TORPEDO WITH AN ACCOUNT OF SOME ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS ON ITS ELECTRICITY BY JOHN DAVY MD FRS ASSISTANT INSPECTOR OF ARMY HOSPITALS COMMUNICATED BY SIR JAMES MCGRIGOR BART FRS DIRECTOR GE NERAL OF THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT RECEIVED MAY 15READ JUNE 19 1834 1 ON THE FOETAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE TORPEDO THE ACCOUNTS WE POSSESS BY DIFFERENT NATURALISTS OF THE MODE OF GENERATION OF THIS FISH ARE SO DISCORDANT AND PERPLEXING THAT I HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO INVESTIGATE THE SUBJECT AFRESH AND I NOW PROPOSE TO SUBMIT TO THE SOCIETY THE RESULTS OF MY OBSER VATIONS IT MAY BE ADVISABLE TO PREMISE A FEW PARTICULARS RESPECTING THE GENERATIVE ORGANS OF THE TORPEDO THE FEMALE LIKE THOSE RAYS AND SQUALI WHICH ARE CONSIDERED OVO VIVIPAROUS HAS TWO OVARIA A COMMON OVIDUCT AND TWO UTERINE CAVITIES THE OVARIA ONE ON EACH SIDE OF THE SPINE ARE ATTACHED TO AND ENVELOPED IN A FOLD OF THE PERITO NAEUM JUST ABOVE THE LIVER AND A VERY LITTLE BELOW THE COMMON INFUNDIBULUM OR OPENING OF THE OVIDUCT THE OVIDUCT PASSES ROUND ON EACH SIDE UNDER THE LIVER AND ENDS IN AN ENLARGEMENT ONE OVER EACH KIDNEY WHICH FROM ITS FUNCTION MAY BE CALLED A UTERINE CAVITY FORMED LIKE THE DUCT ITSELF OF A VILLOUS INNER MEMBRANE AND OF A PERITON0EAL OUTER COAT CONNECTED TOGETHER BY LOOSE FILAMENTOUS TISSUE AND OPENING INTO THE LOWER PART OF THE INTESTINE OR CLOACA BY A COMMON MOUTH A LITTLE POSTERIOR TO THE MINUTE PAPILLA THE TERMINATION OF THE URETERS IN THE OVIDUCT JUST ABOVE ITS ENLARGEMENT INTO THE UTERINE CAVITY THERE IS ONLY A SLIGHT TRACE OF A GLANDULAR STRUC TURE IN WHICH RESPECT THE TORPEDO APPEARS EQUALLY TO DIFFER FROM THE DIFFERENT SPE CIES OF SQUALUS AND OF RAY ALL THOSE WHICH I HAVE EXAMINED OF EITHER GENUS BEING POSSESSED OF A LARGE GLANDULAR BODY IN THE SITUATION MENTIONED THE MALE GENERATIVE ORGANS CONSIST OF TWO FIRM OVAL TESTES OCCUPYING THE SAME SITUATION AS THE OVARIA IN THE FEMALE AND NOT VERY DIFFERENT IN APPEARANCE OF VASA DEFERENTIA WITHOUT VESICULKE SEMINALES AND OF A PAPILLA IN THE CLOACA THE COMMON TERMINATION OF THE SEMINAL AND URINARY PASSAGES NEAR THE VERGE OF THE INTESTINE LIKE THE SQUALI AND RAYS IN GENERAL THE MALE TORPEDO IS PROVIDED WITH TWO AP PENDICES ONE ON EACH SIDE OF THE ANUS COMPOSED OF ARTICULATED BONES OF MUSCLES OF CARTILAGES AND A GLANDULAR STRUCTURE THE EGGS OF THE TORPEDO I HAVE NEVER FOUND IN THE OVIDUCT IN THEIR PASSAGE BUT ONLY IN THE OVARIA OR ATTACHED TO THE OVARIA OR IN THE UTERINE CAVITIES WHEN MATURE ANDDR DAVY ON THE TORPEDO ATTACHED TO THE OVARIA THEY ARE COVERED WITH A VASCULAR MEMBRANE THROUGH WHICH THEY BREAK TO ENTER THE INFUNDIBULUM IN THE UTERINE CAVITY THEY ARE DESTITUTE OF WHITE THEY ARE COVERED BEFORE THE APPEARANCE OF THE EMBRYO WITH A MOST DELICATE MEMBRANE OR PELLICLE AND CONSIST ENTIRELY OF YOLK THE NUMBER OF EGGS VARIES VERY MUCH WITH THE SIZE OF THE FISH IN THE SMALLEST PREGNANT FISH THAT I HAVE EXAMINED I HAVE NEVER FOUND FEWER THAN FOUR IN THE TWO CAVITIES AND IN THE LARGEST NOT MORE THAN SEVENTEEN THEIR SIZE TOO VARIES THEIR AVERAGE WEIGHT IS ABOUT 182 GRAINS THE LARGEST OF EIGHTEEN EGGS WHICH I HAVE WEIGHED TAKEN FROM FIVE DIFFERENT FISH BEFORE THE EMBRYO APPEARED WAS EQUAL TO 210 GRAINS THE SMALLEST TO 129 THOUGH WITHOUT A DISTINCT WHITE THERE IS IN THE UTERINE CAVITY COMMON TO ALL OF THEM A LITTLE FLUID GENERALLY MILKY MORE RARELY GLAIRY AND SOMETIMES BLOODY WHICH ON EVAPORATION AFFORDS CRYSTALS OF COMMON SALT AND A VERY LITTLE ANIMAL MATTER COMPOSED CHIEFLY OF ALBUMEN IN DESCRIBING THE FOETAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE TORPEDO I SHALL CONFINE MYSELF STRICTLY TO WHAT I HAVE ACTUALLY OBSERVED IN THE FIRST STAGE IN WHICH I HAVE WITNESSED THE EMBRYO IT APPEARED AS REPRESENTED IN PLATE XXII FIG L ABOUT SEVEN TENTHS OF AN INCH LONG WITHOUT FINS OR ELECTRICAL ORGANS OR ANY DISTINCT APPEARANCE OF EYES WITH VERY SHORT EXTERNAL BRANCHIAL FILA MENTS  NOT YET CARRYING RED BLOOD AND WITH A RED SPOT IN THE SITUATION OF THE HEART PROBABLY THE HEART ITSELF COMMUNICATING BY RED VESSELS IN THE UMBILICAL CORD WITH THE VASCULAR PART OF THE EGG IN THE NEXT STAGE IN WHICH I HAVE OBSERVED IT IT APPEARED AS IN PLATE XXII FIG 2 NOT QUITE AN INCH LONG NOR A QUARTER OF AN INCH WIDE THE VENTRAL FINS VISIBLE AND ALSO THE DORSAL AND THE INFERIOR PORTION OF THE GREAT PECTORAL FINS THE BRANCHIAL CAR TILAGES DISTINCT AND NAKED THE ELECTRICAL ORGANS NOT HAVING YET APPEARED THE EXTERNAL BRANCHIAL FILAMENTS LONGER THAN IN THE PRECEDING BUT STILL COMPARATIVELY SHORT SORME OF THEM TIPPED WITH RED BLOOD OTHERS CARRYING IT THE NEXT STAGE OF ADVANCE I HAVE SEEN IS REPRESENTED BY FIG 3 PLATE XXII THIS EMBRYO WAS ABOUT AN INCH AND ONE TENTH LONG AND FOUR TENTHS OF AN INCH WIDE WHERE WIDEST AND IT WEIGHED JUST FIVE GRAINS ITS ELECTRICAL ORGANS WERE BEGINNING TO APPEAR THE EXTERNAL BRANCHIAL FILAMENTS WERE ABOUT SIX TENTHS OF AN INCH LONG AND CONTAINED RED BLOOD THE HEART WAS DISTINCT AND LARGE AS WERE ALSO THE TWO LOBES OF THE LIVER THE STOMACH WAS SMALL APPARENTLY EMPTY SMALLER THAN THE INTESTINE THE INTESTINE WAS LARGE AND WHITE THE VITELLOINTESTINAL CANAL WAS DISTINCT IT APPEARED AS A VERY SLENDER THREAD CONNECTED WITH THE UPPER PART OF THE INTESTINE AND LIKE THE IN TESTINE ITSELF IT CONTAINED NO YOLK THE EYES WERE APPARENT THERE WAS A VESICLE ON THE HEAD DISTENDED WITH A COLOURLESS FLUID AND THE CAVITY OF THE CRANIUM WAS FULL OF A SIMILAR FLUID THE ROOTS OF THE ELECTRICAL NERVES WERE VISIBLE BUT NO BRAIN THE NEXT STAGE IN WHICH I HAVE OBSERVED THE EMBRYO IS REPRESENTED BY FIG 4  THESE FILAMENTS VARIABLE IN LENGTH AND APPEARANCE ARE CONSTANT IN CONTAINING EACH A BLOODVESSEL WHICH MAKES THE CIRCUIT OF THE FILAMENT 532DR DAVY ON THE TORPEDO PLATE XXII IT WAS ADVANCED ONLY A LITTLE BEYOND THE PRECEDING THE PRINCIPAL DIFFERENCES WERE IN THE ELECTRICAL ORGANS BEING A LITTLE LARGER THE BRANCHIAL FILAMENTS CONSIDERABLY LONGER ABOUT AN INCH LONG AND THE BRAIN AND SPINAL CORD APPARENT IN THE NEXT STAGE IN WHICH I HAVE SEEN IT AS REPRESENTED BY FIG 5 PLATE XXII THERE WAS A VERY CONSIDERABLE ADVANCE THE FOETUS WAS ABOUT TWO INCHES AND A HALF LONG AND ONE INCH AND THREE QUARTERS WIDE THE ELECTRICAL ORGANS WERE DISTINCT THE PECTORAL FINS ENTIRE THE EXTERNAL BRANCHIAL FILAMENTS VERY LONG THE STOMACH WAS STILL SMALL AND EMPTY WHILST THE INTESTINE WAS DISTENDED WITH YOLK THE EXTERNAL YOLK WAS COVERED WITH A VASCULAR MEMBRANE AND NOT PARTIALLY AS IN THE PRECEDING BUT EN TIRELY THE VITELLOINTESTINAL CANAL FREELY COMMUNICATED WITH THE INTESTINE AND WAS YET VERY LITTLE ENLARGED WHERE IT JOINS ITSELF TO THE INTESTINE AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF ITS VALVULAR PORTION THE NEXT STAGES WHICH HAVE COME UNDER MY OBSERVATION ARE REPRESENTED BY FIGG 6 AND 7 PLATE XXII AND FIG 1 PLATE XXIII THE CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN IS SHOWN LAID OPEN IN FIGG 6 AND 7 IN ORDER TO EXHIBIT THE EXTERNAL YOLK IN PROGRESS OF DIMINUTION AND THE INTERNAL YOLK CONTAINED IN A MEMBRANOUS BAG AS IT WERE A LATE RAL EXTENSION OF THE VITELLOINTESTINAL CANAL IN PROGRESS OF ACCUMULATIONX THE BRAN CHIAL FILAMENTS HAVE ALMOST ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED I SHALL NOTICE ONLY TWO STAGES MORE OF THE YOUNG TORPEDO REPRESENTED BY FIG 4 PLATE XXIII AND FIG 1 PLATE XXIV THE ONE OF A FISH SIX WEEKS OLD IN WHICH THE INTERNAL YOLK WAS CONSIDERABLY DIMINISHED IN BULK ITS CONNEXION WITH THE UM BILICUS ALMOST ABSORBED THE INTESTINE FULL OF YOLK THE STOMACH EMPTY BUT CONSIDER ABLY DEVELOPED THE OTHER OF A FISH SIX MONTHS OLD IN WHICH ONLY A VERY SMALL POR TION OF THE INTERNAL YOLK REMAINED AND THE CONNEXION OF THE INNER YOLKBAG WITH THE UNMBILICUS WAS ABSORBED A VESTIGE ONLY OF THE CANAL OF COMMUNICATION REMAINING THESE FISH AT ABOUT THE FULL PERIOD OF UTEROGESTATION WERE EXTRACTED FROM A TOR PEDO JUST AFTER SHE HAD BEEN CAUGHT WERE INSTANTLY PUT INTO SALT WATER AND WERE PRESERVED ALIVE I SHALL HAVE OCCASION TO REVERT TO THEM IN ANOTHER PART OF MY PAPER I MAY REMARK GENERALLY THAT I HAVE NEVER FOUND IN ANY OF THE GRAVID TORPEDOS WHICH I HAVE EXAMINED IN DIFFERENT STAGES ANY MEMBRANE INVESTING THE FOETUS AS IS  AT THIS PERIOD OF FOETAL DEVELOPMENT THE YOLK HAS TWO DISTINCT MEMBRANES AN EXTERNAL TRANSPARENT ONE AND AN INTERNAL VASCULAR ONE THE FORMER IS OF GREAT DELICACY GENERALLY EXCEPTING WHERE THE EGG JOINS THE ABDO MNEN THERE IT IS VERY THICK AND STRONG AND SLIGHTLY OPAKE SERVING IN A MANNER THE PART OF THE SHEATH OF THE UMBILICAL CORD OF THE MAMMALIA IT IS CONNECTED WITH AND APPEARS TO END IN THE CUTIS OF THE ABDOMEN THE LATTER THE MEMBRANA UMBILICALIS OR CHORION IF IT MAY BE SO CALLED FROM ITS GREAT VASCULARITY PASSES INTO THE CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN AND TERMINATES IN THE VITELLOINTESTINAL CANAL FROM WHENCE THE INTERNAL YOLKVESICLE PRO CEEDS TWO LARGE VESSELS THE TRUNKS OF THE VESSELS OF THE CHORION ENTER THE CORDLIKE TERMINATION OF THE EGG ONE OF THEM TERMINATES IN THE VENA PORTE  THE TERMINATION OF THE OTHER I HAVE NOT ASCERTAINED IN A SATISFACTORY MANNER I BELIEVE IT CORRESPONDS IN FUNCTION TO THE UMBILICAL ARTERIES AND BRINGS BLOOD FROM THE FOETUS TO THE EGG THE OTHER VESSEL RETURNING IT MDCCCXXXIV 3 Z 533534 DR DAVY ON THE TORPEDO THE CASE WITH THE FOETUS OF SOME OF THE SQUALI  NEITHER HAVE I FOUND ANY FLUID IN THE UTERINE CAVITY AT ANY PERIOD EXCEPTING THAT ALREADY MENTIONED THE FACTS I HAVE STATED RELATIVE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FOETUS OF THE TOR PEDO THOUGH AMPLY SUFFICIENT TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS FISH IS NOT OVIPAROUS ARE NOT INCOMPATIBLE WITH ITS BEING OVOVIVIPAROUS AS IT IS CONSIDERED BY THE NATURALISTS WHO HAVE PAID MOST ATTENTION TO THE SUBJECT YET I BELIEVE IT IS NOT STRICTLY SO AND THAT IT IS MORE CORRECT TO SAY THAT IT IS INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN OVOVIVIPAROUS AND VIVIPAROUS THE FOETUS AS I BELIEVE DERIVING ITS SUPPORT IN PART FROM THE OVUM AND IN PART FROM THE PARENT THE PRINCIPAL FACT ON WHICH I FOUND THIS BELIEF IS THAT THE MATURE FOETUS IS VERY MUCH HEAVIER THAN THE EGG IN THE THREE FOLLOWING TABLES I SHALL GIVE THE STATICAL RESULTS SUBSTANTIATING THIS FACT THE FIRST TABLE WILL RELATE TO THE OVUM JUST AFTER IT HAS ENTERED THE UTERINE CAVITY OR BEFORE THE APPEARANCE OF THE EMBRYO THE SECOND TO THE OVUM AFTER THE FOETAL DEVELOPMENT HAS COMMENCED BUT HAS MADE LITTLE PROGRESS AND THE THIRD TO THE FOETUS WHEN MATURE OR NEARLY MATURE INDICATED BY THE TOTAL DISAPPEARANCE OF THE EXTERNAL YOLK OR ITS BEING REDUCED EXTERNALLY TO A VERY SMALL BULK IN NOTICING THE KIND OF TORPEDO I SHALL USE THE POPULAR NAMES BY WHICH THEY ARE DESIGNATED AT ROME RESERVING FOR ANOTHER PLACE THE CONSIDERATION OF ITS SPECIES THE EXACT TIME WHEN THE FISH WAS CAUGHT WILL BE GIVEN WITH A VIEW TO ENDEAVOUR TO DETERMINE ITS BREEDING

NEAR THE FULL TIME DISAPPEARS THE FOETUS OF THE SQUALUS SQUATINA SEEMS TO BE ANALOGOUS TO THAT OF THE TORPEDO WITHOUT A MEMBRANE THAT OF THE SQUALUS GALEUS HAS A MEMBRANE EVEN IN ITS ADVANCED STAGE

CONTAINED IN THESE TABLES IS THAT THE WEIGHT OF THE EGG BEFORE ANY APPEARANCE OF THE EMBRYO IS 182 GRAINS AND AFTER ITS APPEARANCE IN BY THE KIDNEYS OF THE CHICK IN OVO NOR HAVE I SUCCEEDED IN DETECTING UREA IN THE FLUID IT CONTAINS A SUBSTANCE VWHICH I HAVE FOUND IN A NOTABLE QUANTITY IN THE FLUID OF THE UTERINE CAVITY OF THE SQUALUS SQUATINA AND IN ABUNDANCE IN THE LIQUOR AMNII OF THE DOG ABOUT THE FIFTH WEEK OF PREGNANCY AND HAVE ALSO DETECTED IN THE HUMAN LIQUOR AMNII AT THE FULL PERIOD IN THE CLOACA OF VERY YOUNG TORPEDOS I HAVE SOMETIMES SEEN A TRANS PARENT FLUID PROBABLY URINE BUT IN TOO SMALL QUANTITY FOR EXAMINATION THE NATURE OF THE URINARY SECRETION OF THE ADULT TORPEDO I HAVE NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO ASCERTAIN I SUSPECT THAT IT IS LIQUID AND THAT IT IS VOIDED AL MOST AS RAPIDLY AS IT IS SECRETED THE FISH BEING WITHOUT A URINARY BLADDER AND ITS CLOACA OF NARROW DIMENSIONS 3 Z 2DR DAVY ON THE TORPEDO ELUDING THE WEIGHT OF THE EMBRYO ABOUT 177 GRAINS WHILST THE WEIGHT OF THE MATURE FOETAL FISH IS ABOUT 479 GRAINS PROVING AN AUGMENTATION OF WEIGHT IN THE NATURE FOETUS MORE THAN DOUBLE THAT OF THE EGG AND IN THIS RESPECT DIFFERING REMARKABLY FROM THE FOETAL CHICK WHICH AT ITS FULL TIME WEIGHS CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN THE ORIGINAL YOLK AND WHITE FROMI WHICH IT IS FORMED OWING IN PART TO THE EVAPORATION OF WATER THROUGH THE SHELL AND IN PART TO THE EXCRETIONS GOING ON ESPECIALLY OF LITHIC ACID DERIVED FROM THE KIDNEYS IHOW IS THIS AUGMENTATION OF WEIGHT TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR IS THERE AS IN THE MA JORITY OF THE MAMMNALIA ANY CONNEXION BETWEEN THE FOETUS OF THE TORPEDO AND THE PARENT THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF A VASCULAR AND CELLULAR STRUCTURE  OR HAS THE FOETAL FISH IN UTERO LIKE THE FOETUS OF THE SEPIAE IN THE EGG THE POWER OF FEEDING BY THE MOUTH AND OF TAKING FOOD INTO THE STOMACH  OR DOES THE UTER INE CAVITY OF THE PARENT FISH SECRETE OR POUR OUT A FLUID WHICH IS ABSORBED BY AND IN PART NIOURISHES THE FOETUS THE FIRST AND SECOND QUERY I MUST ANSWER IN THE NEGATIVE NOTHING THAT I HAVE OBSERVED INDICATES ANY CONNEXION SUCH AS THAT SUPPOSED IN THE FIRST QUERY BETWEEN THE PARENT AND FOETUS I HAVE CAREFULLY EXAMINED THE GRAVID UTERUS UNDER WATER THINKING IT POSSIBLE THAT THE VILLI OF THE UTERINE CAVITY MIGHT INOSCULATE WITH THE BRANCHIAL FILAMENTS BUT I COULD NOT DETECT THE SLIGHTEST UNION OF THEM OR EVEN AP POSITION I HAVE CAREFULLY EXAMINED TOO THE STOMACH OF THE FOETUS IN ITS DIFFERENT STAGES AND I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND IT EMPTY ADMITTING THEN THAT THE AUGMENTATION IS EFFECTED BY ABSORPTION THE ONLY WAY APPARENTLY REMAINING TO ACCOUNT FOR IT ANOTHER QUESTION ARISES HOW IS THE ABSORPTION ACCOMPLISHED  IS THE WHOLE SURFACE OF THE FOETUS AN ABSORBING SURFACE AS IN THE INSTANCE OF SOME OF THE MAMMNALIA WHICH ARE DESTITUTE OF A PLACENTA AND WHOSE FOETUS DO NOT APPEAR TO BE CONNECTED WITH THE UTERUS AS THAT OF THE OPOSSUM AND KANGAROO  OR ARE THE BRANCHIAL FILAMENTS THE PRINCIPAL ABSORBING ORGANS IT APPEARS NOT IMPROBABLE THAT BOTH THE GENERAL SURFACE AND THE FILAMENTS ARE CONCERNED IN THE OPERATION THE LATE DR MONRO WHO OBSERVED THESE FILAMENTS IN THE FOETUS OF THE COMMON SKATE SUPPOSES THAT THEY PERFORM THE SAME FUNCTION AS THE GILLS AND ARE A SUBSTITUTE FOR THEM LIKE THE BRANCHIAL APPENDICES OF THE TADPOLE AND THE SAME VIEW HAS BEEN TAKEN BY OTHERS OF ANALOGOUS FILAMENTS BELONGING TO THE FAETUS OF MOST OF THE SQUALI THIS FUNCTION THEY MAY PERFORM IN COMMON WITH THE SURFACE AND AT THE SAME TIME THEY MAY CONVEY NOURISHMENT AND MATERIAL FOR GROWTH IF I MAY HAZARD A CONJECTURE I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE MATTER WHICH MAY BE ABSORBED BY THE SURFACE MAY ENTER INTO THE COMPOSITION OF THE BODY GENERALLY WHILST THAT WHICH MAY BE ABSORBED BY THE BRANCHIAL FILAMENTS MAY BE CHIEFLY EMPLOYED IN FORMING THE ELECTRICAL ORGANS AND PERHAPS THE BRANCHIAE AND THE ADJOINING MUCOUS GLANDS I SHALL NOTICE A FEW CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH APPEAR TO ME FAVOURABLE TO THIS CONJECTURE 1 THE BRANCHIAL FILAMIENTS ARE MOST NUMEROUS AND OF GREATEST LENGTH WHILST THE ELECTRICAL ORGANS ARE FORMING APPEARING JUST BEFORE THESE ORGANS BEGIN TO BE DEVE 536DR DAVY ON THE TORPEDO LOPED AND BEING REMOVED WHEN THEY ARE TOLERABLY COMPLETE NOW IT SEEMS MORE REASONABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT THIS ASSOCIATED PROGRESS OF THE TWO IS IN THE RELATION OF CAUSE AND EFFECT THAN TO IMAGINE THAT THE FILAMENTS ARE SOLELY DESIGNED AS A SUBSTI TUTE FOR THE BRANCHIAE ESPECIALLY AS THE BLOOD IN THE VESSELS OF THE YOLK MEMBRANE SEEMS TO BE AS WELL ADAPTED TO RECEIVE THE INFLUENCE OF ANY LITTLE AIR WHICH MAY BE CONTAINED IN THE FLUID IN THE UTERINE CAVITY AS THE BLOOD CIRCULATING IN THE VESSELS OF THE FILAMENTS 2 IN NONE OF THE SQUALI THE FOETUS OF WHICH I HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF EXA MINING AT DIFFERENT PERIODS HAVE I FOUND THE SAME ELABORATE APPARATUS OF BRANCHIAL FILAMENTS THEY HAVE BEEN LESS NUMEROUS AND VERY MUCH SHORTER DOES NOT THIS GREATER ELABORATENESS INDICATE THAT THEY ARE INTENDED IN THE TORPEDO FOR A SPECIAL PURPOSE  AND WHEN WE CONSIDER THE NATURE OF THE ELECTRICAL ORGANS ABOUNDING IN FLUID AS WELL AS THEIR PECULIAR OFFICE DOES IT NOT SEEM ACCORDANT THAT THERE SHOULD BE SUCH A PECULIAR PROVISION AS THAT IN QUESTION FOR THEIR FORMATION  3 IN ONE INSTANCE I FOUND A LARGE FASCICULUS AS REPRESENTED IN PLATE XXIV FIG 2 UNCONNECTED WITH THE BRANCHIAL APERTURES ATTACHED TO THE HEAD ANTERIOR TO THE EYES IN THE SITUATION OF THE PRINCIPAL CLUSTER OF MUCOUS GLANDS IN THE ADULT FISH BETWEEN THE ANTERIOR PORTIONS OF THE TWO ELECTRICAL ORGANS MAY NOT THIS BE CONSIDERED AN INSTANTIA CRLCIS BOTH AS SHOWING THAT THE BRANCHIAL FILAMENTS ARE NOT SOLELY DESIGNED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE GILLS AND RENDERING IT HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT THEY ARE CONCERNED NOT ONLY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ELECTRICAL ORGANS BUT ALSO OF THE MUCOUS GLANDS  IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO DISCUSS THE OTHER TWO MODES IN WHICH THE FEETUS OF THE TOR PEDO IS NOURISHED ANALOGOUS TO WHAT IS WITNESSED IN THE CHICK IN OVO FIRST BY MEANS OF VESSELS CONVEYING BLOOD PASSING FROM THE YOLK MEMBRANE AND AFTERWARDS IN ADDITION BY THE DIRECT PASSAGE OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE YOLK INTO THE INTESTINE OF THE FOETUS THROUGH THE VITELLOINTESTINAL CANAL WHETHER THE FOETUS OF THOSE SQUALI AND RAYS WHICH ARE CONSIDERED OVOVIVIPAROUS ARE ONLY NOURISHED IN THESE TWO WAYS OR ALSO IN THE ADDITIONAL MANNER OF THE FOETUS OF THE TORPEDO IS A SUBJECT FOR INQUIRY FROM WHAT I HAVE OBSERVED I AM RATHER DISPOSED TO THINK THAT THEY ARE NOURISHED IN THE LATTER MANNER THOUGH IN A LESS DE GREE AND WITHOUT EXCEPTING EVEN THOSE WHICH ARE CONTAINED IN A CLOSED MEMRNBRANE FROM THE FACTS GIVEN IN THE PRECEDING TABLES AND FROMU OTHERS WHICH I HAVE OB SERVED IT MAY BE INFERRED THAT THE TORPEDO DOES NOT BEAR YOUNG MORE THAN ONCE A YEAR THAT THE BREEDING SEASON IS THE LATTER END OF AUTUMN AND THE BEGINNING OF WINTER AND THAT THE PERIOD OF UTEROGESTATION IS FROM NINE TO TWELVE MONTHS  I HAVE ALLUDED SOME PAGES BACK TO THE FOETAL TORPEDO AT ITS FULL TERM SINCE I  ACCORDING TO ARISTOTLE IT BRINGS FORTH IN AUTUMN IN MY FORMER PAPER I SUPPOSED ERRONEOUSLY THAT THE PRINCIPAL BREEDING SEASON IS THE SPRING FROM THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THE FISH AT THAT TIME ABOUND IN OVA OF A LARGE SIZE T I SAY FROM NINE TO TWELVE MONTHS BECAUSE I SUSPECT THE PERIOD OF UTEROGESTATION IS NOT PRECISELY FIXED BUT THAT IT VARIES WITH CIRCUMSTANCES FAVOURABLE OR UNFAVOURABLE TO BRINGING FORTH THUS I HAVE HAD YOUNG TOR 537DR DAVY ON THE TORPEDO HAVE BEEN IN MALTA THOUGH I HAVE EXAMINED MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED TORPEDOS I HAVE FOUND FIVE ONLY IN WHICH THE YOUNG WERE ARRIVED AT OR NEAR THIS STAGE OF THESE THREE WERE BROUGHT ALIVE I SHALL GIVE SOME PARTICULARS CHIEFLY OF THEIR BROODS AS THEY MAY NOT BE CONSIDERED UNINTERESTING IN THEMSELVES AND AS THEY MAY TEND TO ILLUSTRATE THE SLOW GROWTH AND SOME OF THE PECULIARITIES OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY FISH THE FIRST LIVE TORPEDO THAT I OBTAINED IN THIS STATE WAS AN OCCHIATELLA ON THE 12TH OF SEPTEMBER IT WAS FOURTEEN INCHES LONG AND EIGHT INCHES AND A HALF WIDE AND AFTER THE EXTRACTION OF THE FOETAL FISH IT WEIGHED ONE POUND THREE OUNCES IT HAD BEEN CAUGHT RATHER MORE THAN AN HOUR AND WAS IN A SMALL BUCKET FULL OF SALT WATER I IMMEDIATELY SET ABOUT PREPARING AN APPARATUS TO TRY ITS ELECTRICITY WHICH OCCUPIED ME ABOUT FIVE MINUTES BUT IT WAS TOO LATETHE FISH WAS THEN MOTIONLESS AS SOON AS THE APPARATUS WAS READY I OPENED THE CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN HOPING THAT IF GRAVID AS ASSERTED BY THE FISHERMAN THE YOUNG MIGHT BE STILL ALIVE FROM EACH UTERINE CAVITY THREE FISH WERE EXTRACTED BUT THEY WERE ALL DEAD NEITHER IN AIR NOR IN SALT WATER DID THEY SHOW THE SLIGHTEST SIGNS OF IRRITABILITY THOUGH THEY HAD NO APPEARANCE OF BEING BRUISED OR IN ANY WAY INJURED THE SIZE OF EACH WAS NEARLY THE SAME THE ONLY DIFFERENCE I COULD PERCEIVE WAS A LITTLE VARIATION IN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE EXTERNAL YOLKBAG IN TWO IT HAD ALL BUT DISAPPEAREDIT WAS SMALLER THAN A BARLEYCORN IN THE OTHER TWO IT WAS A LITTLE LARGER AND IN THE TWO OTHERS PERHAPS A LITTLE LARGER STILL THE INTERNAL YOLK WAS VERY LARGE AND ABOUT THE SAME SIZE IN ALL THEIR ORGANIZATION GENERALLY APPEARED TO BE COMPLETE EVEN TO THEIR TEETH THE NEXT FISH THAT I OBTAINED NEAR ITS FTILL TIME WAS A TREMOLA ON THE 29TH OF SEP TEMBER IT WAS EIGHTEEN INCHES LONG AND THIRTEEN WIDE IT HAD BEEN CAUGHT AN HOUR OR TWO BEFORE AND WAS IN A VERY LANGUID STATE HAVING BEEN PUT INTO A VESSEL CONTAINING ONLY JUST SUFFICIENT WATER TO COVER IT IT WAS TRIED ON THE MULTIPLIER BUT IT DID NOT AFFECT THE NEEDLE WHEN MORIBUND THE ABDOMEN WAS OPENED AND I EX TRACTED WITH THE HAND WITHOUT EXPERIENCING ANY SHOCK FROM THE TWO UTERINE CAVITIES TWELVE FOETAL FISH AND ONE WHICH HAD BEEN EXPELLED BEFORE AND WAS ALIVE AND SWIM MING ABOUT MADE THIRTEEN THEY WERE ALL NEARLY OF THE SAME SIZE AND OF ALL OF THEM THE EXTERNAL YOLKBAG HAD VERY NEARLY DISAPPEARED THE PORTION REMAINING BEING LESS THAN A SMALL PEA MOST OF THEM APPEARED INANIMATE TWO OR THREE ONLY MOVED THEIR TAILS VERY SLIGHTLY AND THE MARGINS OF THE PECTORAL FINS THEY WERE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TRANSFERRED TO FRESH SEAWATER AFTER ABOUT TWO MINUTES ONE OR TWO OF THEM BEGAN TO MOVE THEIR WATERVALVES I I WAS NOW CALLED AWAY AND RATHER MORE THAN FOUR HOURS ELAPSED BEFORE I RETURNED ON MY RETURN I FOUND THEM ALL FREELY RESPIRING PEDOS BROUGHT ME CAUGHT IN THE SEA IN WHICH THE INTERNAL YOLKVESICLE WAS LARGE AND IN ONE INSTANCE I FOUND THEM IN UTERO WITH THIS VESICLE GREATLY REDUCED IN SIZE SO AS TO SUGGEST THE IDEA WHICH ARISTOTLE ADOPTED THAT THE YOUNG OF THE TORPEDO AFTER BIRTH RETURN AT WILL INTO THE UTERUS AN IDEA WHICH CANNOT BE HELD ON ACCOUNT OF ITS ANATOMICAL IMPOSSIBILITY ARISTOTLE HIST ANIMAL VI CAP 10  I APPLY THIS TERM TO THE VALVES WHICH ARE SITUATED AT THE OPENINGS BEHIND THE EYES THE OFFICE OF WHICH APPEARS TO BE TO FORCE WATER INTO THE GULLET TO SUPPLY THE BRANCHI3E WHICH WATER IN REGULAR RESPIRATION PASSES 538DR DAVY ON THE TORPEDO AND MOVING ABOUT ACTIVELY THEY IMPARTED SMART SHOCKS TO THE FINGERS OR FINGER PRESSING THE UPPER SURFACE AND ANOTHER OF THE SAME HAND THE UNDER SURFACE OF THE ELECTRICAL ORGAN THEY DISTINCTLY AFFECTED THE GALVANOMETER AND FEEBLY MAGNETIZED NEEDLES THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF A SPIRAL THESE TRIALS WERE MADE AT 2 PM AT 10 PM ALL THE FISH WERE ALIVE AND VIVACIOUS AN HOUR AFTER I FOUND THEM ALL DEAD THE THIRD FISH I HAVE TO NOTICE WAS A TREMOLA SEVENTEEN INCHES LONG AND TWELVE AND A QUARTER BROAD WHEN BROUGHT ON THE EVENING OF THE 6TH OF NOVEMBER IN A VESSEL OF SALT WATER SOON AFTER IT HAD BEEN CAUGHT IT WAS TOLERABLY VIVACIOUS YET IT DID NOT AFFECT THE GALVANOMETER BEFORE IT WAS QUITE DEAD THE ABDOMEN WAS OPENED AND THE FOETAL FISH WERE EXTRACTED THEY WERE TEN IN NUMBER ALL OF THEM ABOUT THE SAME SIZE IN ALL OF THEM THE OUTER YOLKBAG HAD DISAPPEARED AS REPRESENTED IN PLATE XXIII FIGG 2 3 4 TOUCHING THEM WITH THE HAND IN THE ACT OF REMOVING THEM FROM THE UTERINE CAVITY I RECEIVED A DISTINCT SHOCK SHARP THOUGH NOT STRONG PUT INTO FRESH SEAWATER AS THEY WERE EXTRACTED SOME OF THEM INMMEDIATELY AND IN A FEW SECONDS ALL OF THEM WERE ACTIVE AND SWAIN ABOUT AND MAKING TRIAL OF ONE OF THEM INSTANTLY THE APPARATUS BEING IN READINESS IT POWERFULLY AFFECTED THE GALVANOME TER AND MADE A NEEDLE SLIGHTLY MAGNETIC TO ASCERTAIN THE STATE OF THE INTERNAL YOLK VESICLE ONE OF THESE FISH WAS KILLED BY PUTTING IT INTO FRESH WATER ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AFTER ITS EXTRACTION IT IMMEDIATELY BECAME VERY RESTLESS AND ENDEAVOURED TO ESCAPE THEN IN LESS THAN A MINUTE IT BECAME QUIET AND ITS WATERVALVES CEASED TO ACT TWO OR THREE TIMES AT INTERVALS IT WAS AGAIN RESTLESS IN ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES IT WAS MOTIONLESS AND DEAD  THE APPEARANCE OF ITS INTERNAL YOLKVESICLE IS REPRESENTED IN PLATE XXIII FIG 3 THREE OF THESE FISH REMAINED ALIVE TILL THE 22ND OF MAY IN SEA WATER WHICH WAS CHANGED DAILY OR EVERY SECOND DAY OF THE OTHERS ONE ONLY DIED A NATURAL DEATH THE REST WERE KILLED AT INTERVALS FOR THE PURPOSE OF EXAMINING THE SIZE OF THE INTERNAL YOLKVESICLE WHICH VERY SLOWLY DIMINISHED DURING THIS PERIOD AND AS WELL AS I COULD JUDGE IN A VERY REGULAR MANNER SUPPOSING WHEN FIRST EXTRACTED THAT IN ALL THE INTERNAL YOLK WAS NEARLY OF THE SAME SIZE PLATE XXIV FIG 1 SHOWS THE DIMINUTION IT HAD UNDERGONE ON THE 22ND OF MAY WHEN THE THREE RESIDUAL FISH DIED APPARENTLY FROM THE CARELESSNESS OF A SERVANT GIVING THEM TURBID SALT WATER AND WEAKER IN SALT THAN THEY HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO DURING THE WHOLE OF THIS PERIOD OF FIVE MONTHS AND MORE THEY ATE NOTHING THOUGH VERY SMALL FISH BOTH DEAD AND ALIVE WERE PUT INTO THE WATER THEY RETAINED AND INDEED INCREASED IN ACTIVITY AND EVEN IN THEIR ELECTRICAL ENERGIES OF WHICH I MADE OUT THROUGH THE BRANCHIAL APERTURES BUT OCCASIONALLY IS DISCHARGED THE LATTER BEING CLOSED IN CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY THROUGH THE SUPERIOR APERTURES BLOCH ERRONEOUSLY SUPPOSES THAT THESE LATTER ARE THE NORMAL OUTLETS HE SAYS  ILS SERVENT A 1ANIMAL A REJETTER 1EAU QUIL AVALE SOIT EN PRENANT SA PROIE SOIT CELLE QUI ENTRE PAR LOU VERTURE DES OUIESHISTOIRE NATURELLE DES POISSONS TOM III P 667  IS IT FOUND IN THE NILE AS ASSERTED BY SOME AUTHORS  THE ABOVE FACT WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT THE TORPEDO CANNOT EXIST IN FRESH WATER 539DR DAVY ON THE TORPEDO OCCASIONAL TRIALS THEY ALSO BECAME OF RATHER FIRMER CONSISTENCE AND OF A DARKER COLOUR AND PERHAPS CONTRACTED A LITTLE IN DIMENSIONS THE WEIGHING OF THOSE FIRST KILLED WAS NEGLECTED OF THE THREE WHICH DIED LAST TWO MALES WEIGHED 510 GRAINS EACH THE OTHER A FEMALE 560 GRAINS THEIR STOMLACHS WERE PRETTY LARGELY DEVELOPED BUT EMPTY IN THE INTESTINE THERE WAS A SMALL QUANTITY OF YOLK REMAINING COLOURED GREENISH YELLOW IN THE INFERIOR PART FROM THE ADMIXTURE OF BILE X ALL THESE FACTS SEEM TO SHOW A VERY SLOW DEVELOPMENT AND ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH A LONG PERIOD OF UTEROGESTATION AND I MAY ADD IN FAVOUR OF THE SAME THAT THE OVA IN THE OVARIA OF ALL THE THREE PARENT FISH WERE VERY SMALL THE LARGEST OF THEM NOT EX CEEDING A PEA AND THE MAJORITY OF THEIR MINUTE VESICLES CONTAINING A TRANSPARENT FLUID OTHER INFERENCES MIGHT BE DRAWN FROM THESE DETAILS ESPECIALLY IN FAVOUR OF THE BRANCHIAL FILAMENTS BEING ABSORBENT ORGANS RATHER THAN SUPPLYING THE PLACE OF GILLS THE GILLS BEING APPARENTLY USELESS IN UTERO WHEN FORMED BUT I AM AFRAID OF TRES PASSING FURTHER ON THE TIME OF THE SOCIETY ON A SUBJECT OF LIMITED INTEREST IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS PAPER I HAVE ALLUDED TO THE DISCREPANCYI WHICH EXISTS AMONGST WRITERS ON NATURAL HISTORY RELATIVE TO THE MODE OF GENERATION OF THE TORPEDO ARISTOTLE ALWAYS DESCRIBES THIS FISH AS VIVIPAROUS SO DOES LORENZNI WHO WROTE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY ON THE CONTRARY BLUMENBACH GENERALLY AN ACCURATE WRITER THOUGH HE QUOTES LORENZINI GIVES THE TORPEDO AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE OVIPAROUS CARTILAGINOUS FISH LAYING A FEW LARGE EGGS PROTECTED BY A HORNY SHELL AND EVEN CUVIER APPEARS TO HAVE FALLEN INTO THE SAME ERROR AT LEAST IN HIS REGNE ANIMAL HE HAS NOT CORRECTED IT AND FROM HIS GENERAL ACCOUNT OF THE GENERATION OF THE RAYS BOTH IN THIS WORK AND IN HIS HISTOIRE NATURELLE DES POISSONS IT IS TO BE INFERRED IT IS MOST PROBABLE THAT ANALOGY AND WANT OF CONFIDENCE IN ARISTOTLE AND LORENZINI WERE THE CAUSE OF THIS MISTAKE NO DOUBT HAD THESE ABLE MEN ENJOYED AN OPPORTUNITY OF INVESTIGATING THE SUBJECT THEMSELVES THEY WOULD NOT HAVE FAILED IN ASCERTAINING THE TRUTH EVEN IN MALTA THE INQUIRY IS OF CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY REQUIRING MUCH TIME AND PATIENT WAITING OWING TO THE GREAT RARENESS OF THE GRAVID SH SOME IDEA OF THIS MAY BE FORMED WHEN I MENTION THAT AFTER I HAD BEGUN THE PURSUIT MORE THAN TWELVE MONTHS ELAPSED BEFORE I COULD PROCURE A FISH WITH YOUNG THOUGH I EXAMINED A VERY LARGE NUMBER IN HOPE OF FINDING ONE AND THOUGH I OFFERED TO PAY THE FISHERMEN ABOVE FIFTEEN TIMES THE MARKET PRICE OF THE FISH 2 ON THE SPECIES OF TORPEDO IN THE MLEDITERRANEAN RESPECTING THE NUMBER OF SPECIES OF TORPEDO FOUND IN THE MEDITERRANEAN NATU RALISTS HAVE BEEN MUCH DIVIDED IN OPINION SOME AS RONDELET FOLLOWED BY RISSO ADMITTING FOUR SPECIES SOME

THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO ME TO BE A DOUBT BUT IT APPEARS MORE THAN DOUBTFUL IF ANY OTHER TRUE SPECIES EXIST IN THIS SEA T DRAW THIS CONCLUSION FROM MULTIPLIED OBSERVATIONS MADE BOTH AT ROME AND IN MALTA THAT THESE FISLL THE OCCHIATELLA AND TREMOLA ARE DISTINCT SPECIES ADMITS OF SATISFAC TORY PROOF THEY DIFFER NOT ONLY IN THEIR COLOUR AND GENERAL APPEARANCE BUT ALSO SOME WHAT IN THEIR FORM THE OCCHIATELLA IS MORE GRACEFULLY MADE THAN THE TREMOLA ITS FINS ARE LARGER ESPECIALLY ITS DORSAL FINS ITS WATERVALVES ARE LARGER AND DIFFERENT IN SHAPE AND THE OPENINGS BEHIND THE EYES TO WHICH THEY BELONG ARE GUARDED BY MUCH SMALLER PROJECTIONS THAN PROTECT THOSE PASSAGES IN THE TREMOLA AND INTERNALLY THERE IS A REMARKABLE DIFFERENCE IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE VILLOUS COAT OF THE UTERINE CAVITY  IN THE OCCHIATELLA THE VILLI ARE FILAMENTOUS AND DETACHED AS REPRESENTED IN PLATE XXIV FIG 4 IN THE TREMOLA THEY ARE CONTINUOUS DELICATE PLATES OR LAMINAE AS SHOWN IN PLATE XXIV FIG 3 THESE CHARACTERS ARE CONSTANT IN ALL THE DIFFERENT SPECIMENS WHICH I HAVE EXAMINED TO THESE TWO WELL CHARACTERIZED SPECIES IT APPEARS TO NCE THAT ALL THE VARIETIES OF THE TORPEDO AT LEAST THOSE KNOWN HITHERTO IN THE

THE LAST EDITION OF HIS REGNE ANIMAL AND RUDOLPHI HAVE SO CONSIDERED THE FIRSTMENTIONED VARIETY THE T UNIMACULATA AS IT DIFFERS ONLY IN HAVING ONE EYE SPOT INSTEAD OF FIVE THE MOST COMMON NUMBER BUT IT IS NOT MORE UNCOMMON TO MEET WITH IT HAVING THREE OR FOUR SPOTS THAN ONE AND THAT THIS IS PURELY ACCIDENTAL  BOTH THOSE WHO HAVE ADOPTED FOUR SPECIES AND THOSE WHO HAVE ALLOWED ONLY ONE APPEAR TO

VARIETIES THE FORMER MARKED WITH BLACK SPOTS OR PATCHES IRREGULARLY DISTRIBUTED THE LATTER WITHOUT SPOTS THERE IS A COMPLETE GRADATION OR INTERMIXTURE BOTH THE SPOTTING AND COLOURING VARYING

FISH IS MOST FRE QUENTLY CAUGHT WHERE THE BOTTOM IS SANDY AND THE OTHER VARIETY WHERE IT IS MUDDY LIGHT MAY BE CONCERNED IN THE DIFFERENCE AND THE SPOTS MAY BE PRODUCED LIKE FRECKLES BY THE ACTION OF LIGHT AND IN PROCESS OF TIME THEY MAY BECOME HEREDITARY THE FOE TUSES GENERALLY EVEN OF THESE VARIETIES RESEMBLING IN APPEARANCE THE PARENT FISH RUDOLPHI HAS GIVEN TO THE OCCHIATELLA SPECIES THE ITALIAN NAMNE OF T OCELLATA PERHAPS THE LATIN WORD OCULATA  MAY BE PREFERABLE THE OTHER SPECIES HE DESIGNATES AS THE T MARMORATA FOR WHICH MIGHT BE SUBSTITUTED THE TERM DIVERSICOLOR BEING APPLICABLE TO ALL THE VARIETIES OF IT AND DESCRIPTIVE OF ITS QUALITY OF VARIABLENESS OF APPEARANCE FOR THE INFORMATION OF TRAVELLERS WHO MAY VISIT MALTA AND WISH TO INVESTIGATE THE ELECTRICITY OF THE TORPEDO I MAY MENTION THAT THIS FISH BOTH THE T OCULATA AND DIVERSICOLOR IS CALLED BY THE MALTESE IIADDAYLA DERIVED FROM A VERB IN THEIR LAN GUAGE SIGNIFYING TO BENUMB OR PARALYZE AND CONSEQUENTLY THAT IT SHOULD BE INQUIRED FOR BY THIS NAME NOT BY THAT OF TORPEDO WHICH IS GENERALLY UNKNOWN HERE I MAY ADD FURTHER BY WAY OF CAUTION THAT THE TORPEDO IN MALTA IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO BE PROCURED PARTLY OWING TO ITS BEING LITTLE SOUGHT AFTER FOR THE TABLE BEING USED AS AN ARTICLE OF FOOD ONLY BY THE INDIGENT AND PARTLY I BELIEVE FROM THE UNCERTAINTY AND IRREGULARITY OF ITS COMING INTO SHALLOW WATER HOWEVER

REGULATING THE HEIGHT OF THE SPIRIT IN THE STERN AND IN USING AS SMALL A QUANTITY OF SPIRIT AS POSSIBLEF THE DELICACY OF THIS INSTRUMENT WAS SO GREAT THAT THE SPIRIT WAS NOT ONLY MOVED BY A SINGLE SPARK OF THE ELECTRICAL MACHINE BUT EVEN VERY DISTINCTLY BY THE ELECTRICITY OF A SINGLE VOLTAIC COMBINATION COMPOSED OF A COPPER AND ZINC WIRE THE FORMER LTH OF AN INCH IN DIAMETER THE LATTER TO EXCITED BY DILUTE SULPHURIC ACID THIS INSTRUMNENT WAS STRONGLY AFFECTED BY ACTIVE FISH AND EVEN DISTINCTLY BY WEAK ONES INDEED OCCASIONALLY WHEN IT HAS FORMED PART OF A CIRCLE IN CONNEXION WITH A GALVANOMETER I HAVE SEEN IT AFFECTED ALONE THE GALVANOMETER AFFORDING NO INDICATION OF THE PASSAGE OF THE ELECTRICITY USING TWO AIR THERMOMETERS OF THE SAME CONSTRUC TION EACH CONNECTED WITH THE WIRES FOR CONTACT AT ONE END AND WITH A GALVANOMETER AT THE OTHER THE HHEATING EFFECT OF THE ELECTRICITY OF THE TORPEDO HAS BEEN APPARENTLY DIRNINISHED AND EVEN MORE DISTINCTLY DIMINISHED ON ADDING TO THE CIRCLE ANOTHER LINK OF VERY FINE PLATINA WIRE AND AT THE SARRE TIME ITS INFLUENCE ON THE GALVANOMETER HAS BEEN DIMINISHED AND ITS POWER OF IMPARTING PERMANENT IMAGNETISM TO A NEEDLE PLACED IN A SPIRAL BOTH FORMING PART OF THE CIRCLE WHEN HEAT HAS BEEN APPLIED TO THE EXTRA LINK OF PLATINA BY MEANS OF A SPIRIT LAMP SO AS TO RENDER IT RED HOT THE DIMINUTION OF EFFECT HAS DISAPPEARED AND EQUALLY SO AS WELL AS I COULD JUDGE FROM MANY EXPERIMENTS WHETHER ACTING ON THE THERMOMETER THE GALVANOINETER OR THE NEEDLE IN THE SPIRAL IT APPEARED NOT IMPROBABLE THAT A SHORT PORTION OF A VERY FINE PLATINA WIRE MIGHT BE IGNITED IN THE PASSAGE OF THE ELECTRICITY OF THE TORPEDO I HAVE MADE SEVERAL EX PERIMENTS TO ASCERTAIN THIS BUT HAVE NEVER WITNESSED THE EFFECT EVEN IN PERFECT DARK NESS AND USING FISH THE DISCHARGE OF WHOSE ELECTRICITY AT THE SAME TIME CONVELTED A NEEDLE INTO A TOLERABLY POWERFUL MAGNET THE NEEDLE HAVING BEEN PUT INTO A SPIRAL CONNECTED WITH THE FINE WIRE SO AS TO AFFORD A TEST OF THE STRENGTH OF THE ELECTRICITY THIS WANT OF IGNITION MAY AT FIRST VIEW SEEM CONTRARY TO THE EFFECT ON THE THERMO METER BUT PERHAPS IT OUGHT NOT TO BE CONSIDERED SO TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE RAPIDC MANNER IN WHICH THE HEAT EVOLVED IN THE FINE PLATINA WIRE MUST BE CARRIED OFF BY THE ADJOINING COMPOUND WIRE OF PLATINA AND SILVER THE EXPERIMENTS DETAILED IN MY FORMER PAPER WERE DEMONSTRATIVE THAT THE ELEC TRICITY OF THE TORPEDO IS CAPABLE OF ACTING LIKE VOLTAIC ELECTRICITY IN EFFECTING CHEIMICAL  PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 1813 P 114 T I MENTION THESE CIRCUMSTANCES BECAUSE I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO REFER TO MR HARRISS LATER ACCOUNT OF HIS INSTRUMENT PUBLISHED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH I SHOULD ADD THAT THE BULB OF THE THERMOMETER WAS DEFENDED FROM THE VARIABLE TEMPERATURE OF THE SURROUNDING AIR BY BEING IN CLUDED IN A WOODEN BOX 4 A 2 543DR DAVY ON THE TORPEDO DECOMPOSITIONS AND SEVERAL OTHER TRIALS WHICH I HAVE MADE ARE AMPLY CONFIRMATORY OF THIS IN THESE LATTER EXPERIMENTS I HAVE NOT AS IN THE FORMER COATED THE WIRES INTRODUCED INTO THE FLUIDS WITH SEALINGWAX LEAVING THE POINTS ONLY EXPOSED THOUGH THE WIRES WERE NAKED AND IN EVERY INSTANCE INTRODUCED MORE THAN A QUARTER OF AN INCH INTO THE FLUID AND THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEIN WAS AT LEAST A TENTH OF AN INCH YET SATISFACTORY RESULTS WERE OBTAINED USING EITHER A SATURATED SOLUTION OF COMMON SALT OR A MIXTURE OF EQUAL PARTS OF SULPHURIC ACID OF COMMERCE AND WATER AND PLATINA OR GOLD WIRES GAS WAS GIVEN OFF ROUND EACH WIRE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE DISCHARGE OF THE ELECTRICITY OF AN ACTIVE FISH ONE CONTACT WILE BEING APPLIED TO THE UNDER SURFACE AND THE OTHER TO THE UPPER SLURFACE OF THE TORPEDO WHEN STEEL NEEDLES WERE USED WITH THE SALT WATER THEN GAS WAS DISENGAGED ONLY FROM THE ONE IN CON NEXION WITH THE UNDER SURFACE OF THE FISH THE OTHER NEEDLE BECOMING OXIDATED USING A STRONG SOLUTION OF NITRATE OF SILVER AND GOLD WIRES SILVER WAS PRECIPITATED ONLY ON THAT IN CONNEXION WITH THE UNDER SURFACE EMPLOYING STRONG NITRIC ACID AND PLATINA WIRES GAS WAS GIVEN OFF FROM ONE ONLY THAT IN CONNEXION WITH THE UPPER SURFACE AND USING A SOLUTION OF IODIDE OF POTASSIUM AND STARCH  THE IODINE IN COMBINATION WITH THE STARCH AS INDICATED BY THE DISCOLOURATION WAS PRECIPITATED ROUND THE SAME WIRE EVEN THE DECOMPOSITION OF WATER HAS BEEN EFFECTED WHEN THE CIRCLE HAS BEEN IN TERRUPTED BY FOUR PORTIONS OF THE SOLUTION OF COMMON SALT CONTAINED IN SMALL TUBES WITH TWO NEEDLES IN EACH THE NEEDLES IN ONE CONNECTED WITH THOSE IN THE OTHER AND AT THE SAME TIME WITH THE GALVANOMETER A SPIRAL HOLDING AN UNMAGNETIZED NEEDLE AND AN AIR THERMOMNETER AND SIMNULTANEOUS WITH THE CHEMICAL DECOMPOSITION THE NEEDLE IN THE GALVANOMETER HAS BEEN NMOVED AND THE SPIRIT IN THE AIR THERMOMETER HAS BEEN RAISED AND THE NEEDLE IN THE SPIRAL HAS BEEN MNAGNETIZED THE TESTS OR INDICATIONS OF THE ELECTRICITY OF THE TORPEDO AT PRESENT KNOWN ARE SIX IN NUMBER NAMELY THE PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECT AS THE SENSATION IT IMPARITS IS SOMETIMNES CALLED THE CHLEMICAL EFFECTS AS THE PRECIPITATION OF IODINE THE DECOMPOSITION OF WATER C ITS EFFECT ON THE THERMOMETER ON THE GALVANOTNETER AND ON STEEL IN THE SPIRAL THESE DIFFERENT TESTS IN POINT OF DELICACY I AM INCLINED TO BELIEVE ARE IN THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY ARE ENUMERATED THAT THE TWO FIRTST SHOULD BE PLACED HIGHEST AND THAT SENSATION SHOULD HAVE THE PRECEDENCE THE EXPERIMNENTS WHICH I HAVE MADE APPEAR TO PROVE INDEPENDENTLY OF ALL ANALOGY WHEN THE HUMAN BODY HAS FORMED PART OF A CIRCLE OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE TWO OPPOSITE SURFACES OF A TORPEDO AND ALSO A CHLEMICAL APPARATUS WITH PLATINA WIRES AND THE SOLUTION OF IODIDE OF POTASSIUM AND STARCH THE SHOCK EXPERIENCED BY THE HANDS HAS BEEN STRONG AND THE CHEMICAL EFFECT EITHER NULL OR SLIGHT NO GAS APPEARING WHEN A STRONG SOLUTION OF SALT HAS BEEN USED AND NO PRECIPITATION OF IODINE OCCURRING UNLESS THE PLATINA POINTS WERE VERY NEARLY IN CONTACT AND THE FISH ENERGETIC  WHEN STARCH IN POWDER IS ADDED TO A SATURATED OR NEARLY SATURATED SOLUTION OF THE IODIDE OF POTASSIUM A TRANSPARENT GELATINOUS MASS IS FORMED THIS I HAVE USED IN MY EXPERIMENTS A SINGLE COMBINATION OF COPPER AND ZINC WIRE ACTED ON BY A VERY DILUTE ACID OCCASIONS IN THIS COMPOUND A PRECIPITATION OF IODINE 544DR DAVY ON THE TORPEDO WHEN BESIDES THE HUMAN BODY AND THE CHEMICAL APPARATUS THE GALVANORNETER HAS BEEN INTRODUCED INTO THE CIRCLE WITH THE AIR THERMOMETER AND SPIRAL THE SHOCK HAS BEEN EXPERIENCED AS IF IT HAD BEEN RECEIVED DIRECT FROM THE FISH BUT I HAVE NEVER WITNESSED AT THE SAMNE TIME ANY OTHER EFFECT NOT TAKING THE HUMAN BODY INTO THE CIRCLE IN TRIALS ON FISH OF VERY FEEBLE ELEC TRICITY I HAVE WITNESSED THE PRECIPITATION OF IODINE WHEN NEITHER THE AIR THERMOMETER NOR A DELICATE GALVANOMETER WITH A DOUBLE NEEDLE HAS BEEN AFFECTED THE SAME KIND OF EVIDENCE HAS BEEN OBTAINED OF THE THERMOMETRICAL TEST BEING NEXT IN POINT OF DELICACY IN AS MUCH AS I HAVE SEEN THE AIR THERMOMETER AFFECTED BY A FISH WHICH HAD NO INFLUENCE ON THE GALVANOMETER IN CONNEXIONI WITH THE WIRE OF THE THERMOMETER THAT THE NEEDLE IN THE SPIRAL IS THE LEAST DELICATE TEST DOES NOT REQUIRE TO BE IN SISTED ON THE ELECTRICITY OF A TORPEDO OF ALMNOST FEEBLE ENERGY HAS BEEN EQUAL TO PRODUCE ALL THE EFFECTS ALLUDED TO AT ONCE EXCEPTING SENSATION AS ALREADY EXPLAINED AND EXCEPTING THE IMPARTING PERMANENT MAGNETISM TO THE STEEL NEEDLE THE LAST EFFECT AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED HAS REQULIRED GREATER FORCE A MODERATE FORCE HOWEVER HAS BEEN SUFFICIENT WHEN A VERY SLENDER NEEDLE HAS BEEN USED AND A SPIRAL OF FINE WIRE CLOSELY COILED ONLY JUST CAPABLE OF RECEIVING THE NEEDLE IT HAVING BEEN STATED ON HIGH AUTHORITY THAT A SPARK HAS BEEN OBTAINED FROM THE GYMNOTUIS ELECTRICTUST I HAVE THOUGHT IT RIGHT TO RENEW THE ATTEMPT TO PROCURE A SPARK FROM THE TORPEDO I HAVE TRIED THE METHOD WHICH IT IS SAID SUCCEEDED WITH MR WALSH IN THE INSTANCE OF THE GYMTNNOTUS NAMELY DIVIDING WITH A PENKNIFE GOLD LEAF ATTACHED TO GLASS AND CONNECTING THE DIVIDED PARTS WITH THE CONTACT WIRES USING AN ACTIVE FISH IN THIS WAY I COULD NEITHER OBSERVE A SPARK IN THE DARK NOR IN THE LIGHT DETECT THE SLIGHLTEST INDICATIONS OF THE PASSAGE OF ELECTRICITY EITHER BY THE GALVANOMETER OR THE MORE DELICATE TEST OF THE SENSATION OR SHOCK I HAVE BEEN EQUALLY UNSUCCESSFUL USING AN ELECTROSCOPE FORMED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF COULOMBS WHICH DISPLAYED SPARKS WHEN TOUCHED EITHER BY A SMALL ROD OF GLASS SLIGHTLY EXCITED OR OF SEALINGWAX EVEN WHEN THE TORPEDO WAS TAKEN OUT OF WATER AND ALL ADHERING MOISTURE REMOVED NO EFFECT COULD BE OBTAINED NOT EVEN THE SLIGHTEST INDICATIONS OF ATTRACTION I HAVE VARIED THE TRIALS USING HIGHLY RAREFIED AIR AT ORDINARY TEMPERA TURES AND ALSO CONDENSED AIR DEPRIVED OF MOISTURE WITH THE SAME NEGATIVE RESULT AND I HAVE BEEN EQUALLY UNSUCCESSFUL IN SUBSTITUTING FLAME UNLESS THE METALLIC POINTS WERE IN CONTACT IN THE FLAME OF THE SPIRITLAMP THE PASSAGE OF THE ELECTRICITY  THE SPIRAL I HAVE

COMPLETELY INTERRUPTED IN VERY MANY EXPERIMENTS EMPLOYING THE MOST ACTIVE FISH IF THERE WERE ANY VISIBLE SPACE BETWEEN THE ENDS OF THE REDHOT PLA TINA WIRE I NEVER WITNESSED THE GALVANOMETER IN CONNEXION WITH ONE WIRE AFFECTED NOR COULD OBTAIN A SHOCK REASONING ON THE SUBJECT THIS PERHAPS IS WHAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED CONSIDERING THAT THE SURFACE OF THE FISH IS A BETTER CONDUCTOR THAN AIR ONE FACT HOWEVER WHICH I HAD OBSERVED AFFORDED SOME ENCOURAGEMENT TO PERSIST IN THE TRIALS THE FACT THAT THE TORPEDINAL ELECTRICITY PASSES THROUGH DISTILLED WATER WHLICH IS A WORSE CONDUCTOR OF IT THAN ITS OWN SKIN I THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE THAT BY INSULATING THE TORPEDO ON A PLATE OF DRY GLASS AND WIPING ITS CIRCUMFERENCE DRY AND SMEARING IT WITH OIL THAT EITHER A SPARK MIGHT BE PROCURED OR THAT THE GALVANOMETER MIGHT BE AFFECTED BUT IN THIS TOO I HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED NOT EVEN IN FLAME WHEN THE INTERRUPTION OF THE CIRCLE HAS BEEN ONLY JUST VISIBLE HAS ANY EFFECT ON THE INSTRUMENT BEEN PRODUCED OR ANY CHEMICAL EFFECT USING THE DELICATE TEST OF SOLUTION OF IODIDE OF POTASSIUM AND STARCH IN A FEW EXPERIMENTS ON METALLIC CONDUCTORS THE EFFECT OF THE ELECTRICITY OF THE TORPEDO ON THE GALVANOMETER APPEARED TO BE MUCH THE SAME WHATEVER METALS WERE USED AND WHETHER RUSTY OR BRIGHT PROVIDED THE JUNCTIONS WERE BRIGHT THE MASS OF METAL APPEARED TO HAVE MORE INFLUENCE THE EFFECT AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED DIMINISHING WITH THE INCREASE OF THE MASS THUS WHEN A POKER WEIGHING ABOUT TWO POUNDS FORMED A PARIT OF THE CIRCLE THE EFFECT ON THE ELECTROMETER THOUGH DISTINCT WAS LESS POWERFUL THAN WHEN IT WAS OMITTED AND WHEN A LARGE COPPER COALSCUTTLE WAS SUBSTITUTED FOR IT THE EFFECT WAS STILL MORE DIMINISHED THE DEVIATION OF THE NEEDLE BEING ONLY JUST VISIBLE EXTENSION OF SURFACE AS IN THE INSTANCE OF INCREASED LENGTH OF WIRE HAD A SENSIBLE MODIFYING EFFECT THUS IN AN EXPERIMENT IN WHICH ABOUT 1000 FEET OF WIRE WERE USED FORMED OF THREE PIECES TWO ABOUT GITH OF AN INCH IN DIAMETER THE THIRD PIECE CONSIDERABLY FINER THE MOTION OF THE NEEDLE WAS DECIDEDLY SLOWER THAN WHEN A SHORT LENGTH OF WIRE WAS ELNPLOYED THOUGH THE SPACE TRAVERSED WAS NOT PERCEPTIBLY DIFFERENT THE FEW EXPERIMENTS WHICH I HAVE MADE ON THE TORPEDO ANALOGOUS TO THOSE INSTI TUTED BY MR TODD DESCRIBED BY HIM IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS FOR 1816 HAVE AFFORDED VERY SIMILAR RESULTS WHEN THE BRAIN HAS BEEN DIVIDED LONGITUDINALLY THE FISH HAS CONTINUED TO GIVE SHOCKS WHEN THE BRAIN HAS BEEN ENTIRELY EXTRACTED THE FISH INSTANTLY LOST THIS POWER THOUGH THE MUSCLES GENERALLY CONTINUED TO ACT POWERFULLY NOR COULD ANY SHOCK BE PROCURED IN THIS INSTANCE EITHER BY PUNCTURING WITH A SHARP INSTRUMENT THE ELECTRICAL NERVES WHERE THEY QUIT THE CAVITY OF THE CRA NIUM OR WHERE THEY ENTER THE ELECTRICAL ORGANS JUST AFTER PASSING BETWEEN THE BRANCHIAL CARTILAGES ON ONE OCCASION HOWEVER IT MAY BE MENTIONED THAT WHEN A SMALL PORTION OF BRAIN WAS ACCIDENTALLY LEFT CONTIGUOUS TO THE ELECTRICAL NERVES OF ONE SIDE AND WITH WHICH TEY WERE CONNECTED THEN THE FIS ON BEING IRRITATED GAVE A SHOCK TO AN ASSISTANT WHO GRASPED THE CORRESPONDING ELECTRICAL ORGAN M DE HUMBOLDT STATES THAT THE SHOCK OF THE TORPEDO MAY BE PROCURED BY TOUCH 546DR DAVY ON THE TORPEDO ING WITH THE FINGER OR HAND ONE SURFACE ONLY OF THE FISH  THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH I HAVE MADE EXPRESSLY ON THIS POINT HAVE LED ME TO A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION NAMELY THAT IT IS REQUISITE TO TOUCH THE OPPOSITE SURFACES OF THE ELECTRICAL ORGANS OR ORGAN OR A CONDUCTOR OR CONDUCTORS CONNECTED WITH THEM TO RECEIVE A SHOCK IN VERY MANY INSTANCES THAT I HAVE IRRITATED TORPEDOS BY PRESSING WITH THE FINGER ON DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BACK AS THE UPPER SURFACE OF THE ELECTRICAL ORGANS AND ON THE MARGIN OF THE PECTORAL FINS HOWEVER MUCH THE FISH WERE IRRITATED I NEVER HAD ANY SENSATION EXCITED BY THE ELECTRICITY WHICH THERE WAS REASON TO BELIEVE WAS DISCHARGED THOUGH IMNMEDIATELY AFTER ON TOUCHING THE TWO SURFACES IRRITATING ONLY THE UPPER SHOCKS WERE RECEIVED ON SOME FEW OCCASIONS I HAVE PERCEIVED A SHOCK WHEN APPARENTLY ONLY ONE SURFACE OF THE FISH WAS TOUCHED BUT I BELIEVE IN THESE INSTANCES THE DIS CHARGE TOOK PLACE THROUGH THE WATER  IN CORROBORATION I MAY MENTION THAT IN EXPERIMENTS IN WHICH ONE SURFACE ONLY HAS BEEN TOUCHED AND IRRITATED THE FISH THEM SELVES APPEAR TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO BRING BY MUSCULAR CONTRACTION THE BORDER OF THE UNDER SURFACE THE UPPER BEING PRESSED ON IN CONTACT WITH THE OFFENDING BODY AND THIS I HAVE WITNESSED AS DISTINCTLY IN THE FEETAL FISH AS IN THE ADULT CLEARLY SHOWING THAT THE EFFORT IS INSTINCTIVE  THE CONDUCTOR WHICH I SUPPOSE TO BE NECESSARY FOR CONVEYING THE ELECTRICITY WHEN A SHOCK IS FELT WITHOUT IMMEDIATE CONTACT EXISTS IN SALT WATER THE GALVANOMETER HAS BEEN AFFECTED WHEN THE TWO EXTREMITIES OF IT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN CONTACT ONE WITH THE BACK OF THE FISH AND THE OTHER WITH THE WATER TWO OR THREE INCHES FROM THE FISH AND IN ONE INSTANCE I EXPERIENCED A SHOCK ALTHOUGH I TOUCHED THE WATER ALONE CLOSE TO A TORPEDO IT WAS IN REMOVING AN ACTIVE FISH BY MEANS OF AN EARTHENWARE DISH FROM ONE VESSEL INTO ANOTHER THE HAND THAT RECEIVED THE SHOCK GRASPED THE WET MARGIN OF THE DISH JUST AS THE TORPEDO ENTERED IT I BELIEVE THAT THE TORPEDO HAS THE POWER OF DISCHARGING ITS ELECTRICITY IN ANY DIREC TION IT CHOOSES THIS INFERENCE IS DRAWN FROM FINDING THAT WHEN ONE HAND IN CONTACT WITH THE OPPOSITE SURFACES OF THE FISH IS RECEIVING SHOCKS THE OTHER HAND INMMERSED IN THE WATER CLOSE BY HAS RECEIVED NO SHOCK AND IN CONFIRMATION OF THIS I MAY MENTION AND AT THE SAME TIME TO SHOW HOW THE DISCHARGE IS CONNECTED WITH THE VOLITION OF THE ANIMAL THAT WHEN I HAVE APPLIED TO THE OPPOSITE SURFACES OF A TOR PEDO COPPER PLATES MERELY GENTLY TOUCHING JOINED TOGETHER BY A COPPER WIRE AND  ANNALES DE CHIMIE ET DE PHYSIQUE TOM XI P 430 F THE MOST REMARKABLE EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF WHICH I HAVE ANY NOTE WAS THAT OF A YOUNG TORPEDO WHICH GAVE SLIGHT SHOCKS TO THE HAND ON WHICH IT WAS SUPPORTED WHETHER JUST UNDER THE SURFACE OF THE WATER OR JUST AFTER IT WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE WATER INTO THE AIR T IN MY FORMER PAPER I HAVE SUPPOSED THAT THE MUCUS WITH WHICH THE TORPEDO IS LUBRICATED MAY BE A CON DUCTING MEDIUM BETWEEN THE TWO OPPOSITE SURFACES THIS WAS AN ERRONEOUS VIEW IT MAY SERVE THAT PURPOSE TO THE SURFACES INDIVIDUALLY SEEING THE ERROR THEORETICALLY I WAS LED TO EXAMINE THE MARGINS OF THE FINS AND THEY HAVE APPEARED TO ME TO HAVE ESS MUCUS ADHERING TO THEM THAN ANY OTHER PART OF THE FISH AS IF INTENDED PARTIALLY TO INSULATE THE ELECTRICAJ ORGANS 547DR DAVY ON THE TORPEDO THEN IRRITATED THE FISH WITH THE CONTACT WIRES IN THE USUAL MANNER THE GALVANOMETER ATTACHED TO THE CONTACT WIRES HAS BEEN DISTINCTLY AFFECTED IN MY FORMER PAPER I HAVE STATED NMY INABILITY TO ACCOUNT FOR MY BROTHER THE LATE SIR HUMPHRY DAVY NOT HAVING OBTAINED ANY POSITIVE RESULTS IN HIS EXPERIMENTS ON THE TORPEDO AFTER RECONSIDERING THE SUBJECT I AM DISPOSED TO THINK IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN OWING TO HIS USING LARGE FISH WITHOUT THE MEANS OF ASCERTAINING THEIR ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY EXCEPTING BY THE SHOCK AND WE HAVE SEEN THAT WHEN THE HUMAN BODY FORMS PART OF THE CIRCLE OF COMMUNICATION WITH A GALVANOMETER THE LATTER IS NOT AFFECTED IN THE PASSAGE OF THE ELECTRICITY PRODUCING THE SHOCK WHICH MAY SERVE TO EXPLAIN HIS NOT HAVING WITNESSED ANY EFFECT ON THE INSTRUMENT AT TRIESTE AS REGARDS THE ELECTRI CAL ENERGIES OF LARGE TORPEDOS NOTHING IS MORE UNCERTAIN THERE APPEARS TO BE NO RELATION BETWEEN THE MUSCULAR AND ELECTRICAL POWER I HAVE SEEN STRONG VIVACIOUS FISH WHICH MADE GREAT MUSCULAR EXERTIONS IN THE WATER ALMOST OR ENTIRELY DESTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL POWER AND ON THE CONTRARY I HAVE SEEN OTHERS LANGUID AND MORIBUND WHICHL HAVE EXERTED CONSIDERABLE ELECTRICAL POWER SMALL FISH ARE ALMOST ALWAYS ACTIVE ELECTRICALLY AND THEY ARE GREATLY TO BE PREFERRED AS SUBJECTS FOR EXPERIMENT MR WVALSH NOTICED IN THE FISH ON WHICH HE EXPERIMENTED AT ROCHELLE AND THE ISLE OF R6 A RETRACTION OF THE EYES OF THE TORPEDO AT THE INSTANT IT EXERCISED ITS ELECTRICAL FUNCTION THIS I HAVE NOT WITNESSED IN THE TORPEDOS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN NOR INDEED HAVE I BEEN ABLE TO ASSOCIATE ANY VISIBLE SIGN ANY APPARENT MOVEMENT OF THE FISH WITH THE ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE THE ELECTRICITY OF THE TORPEDO THEORETICALLY CONSIDERED OFFERS A WIDE FIELD FOR SPECULATION IS IT IT MAY BE ASKED MERELY A FORM OR VARIETY OF COMMON ELECTRICITY OR A DISTINCT KIND OR NOT A SINGLE POWER BUT A COMBINATION OF MANY POWERS  THE FIRST OPINION WHICH IS COMMONLY RECEIVED AND WHICH HAS BEEN ABLY ADVOCATED RECENTLY BY MR FARADAY IS SUPPORTED BY THE MAJORITY OF THE FACTS ADDUCED IN THIS PAPER THE CIRCUMSTANCE PRINCIPALLY HOSTILE TO IT AT LEAST IN APPEARANCE IS THE INTER RUPTION OF THE TORPEDINAL ELECTRICITY BY THE SMALLEST QUANTITY OF AIR AND ITS WANT OF THE POWER OF ATTRACTION AND REPULSION IN THE AIR THESE PECULIARITIES ARE SEEMINGLY IN FAVOUR OF THE SECOND OPINION THAT THE ELECTRI CITY OF THE TORPEDO IS SPECIFIC AND PECULIAR BUT TILL THE OPPOSITE SURFACES OF THE ELEC TRICAL ORGANS CAN BE PERFECTLY INSULATED SO THAT NO EASIER MODE OF COMMUNICATION IS AFFORDED THAN THROUGH AIR THEY CAN HARDLY BE CONSIDERED AS DESERVING OF MUCH WEIGHT  THE ORIGIN OF THE ELECTRICITY OF THIS FISH PERHAPS OFFERS A STRONGER ARGUMENT IN FAVOUR OF ITS SPECIFIC NATURE BEING APPARENTLY PECULIAR AND DISTINCT FROM ANY KNOWN MODE OF ELECTRICAL EXCITEMENT INDEPENDENT AS FAR AS WE CAN JUDGE OF CHEMI CAL ACTION OR CHANGE OF TEMPERATURE OR CHANGE OF FORM BUT THIS ARGUMENT MAY BE  IN THE EXPERIMENTS IN WHICH I ATTEMPTED TO INSULATE THE SURFACES BY MEANS OF OIL TE PROBABILITY IS THAT I FAILED AND THAT A COMMUNICATION CONTINUED IF NOT BY THE OUTER SURFACE OF THE SKIN AT LEAST BY ITS INNER INDEED THE ATTEMPT TO INSULATE THESE ORGANLS IN THE MANNER DESIRED SEEMS TO BE ALMOST HOPELESS 548IU IAMR6RJRBC GXXXI PLIEIXXII P IJ9 1 I O TK G   EIJ  9 IILIRILIAAL II I   I IZ 1  1 1 I I P A

AS A GUIDE TO RESEARCH IT MAY NOT BE USELESS IT APPLIES HOWEVER ALMOST AS MUCH TO OTHER VARIETIES OF ELEC TRICITY AS TO THAT OF THE TORPEDO ALL OF WHICH IT IS POSSIBLE MAY BE COMPOUNDED OR OWE THEIR VARIOUS EFFECTS TO THE UNION OF SEVERAL POWERS OR ETHEREAL FLUIDS AND THEIR PECULIARITIES COMPARED ONE WITH ANOTHER TO THE PREDOMINANCE IN VARIOUS DEGREES OF THESE FLUIDS WHAT IS KNOWN OF THE SOLAR

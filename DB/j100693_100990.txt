OF SAP AND TO FIND OUT WHETHER IT ASCENDS MORE OR LESS IN THE PRICTT CIRCLES OF THE BODY THEN IN THOSE BETWIXT THE BO DY AND BARK LET THE TREE EXEMPTED FROM ALL ITS SAP THE DAY BEFORE BE FIRST PEIRCED WITH AN AUGER ONLY THROUGH THE BARK AND THE QUANTITY OF SAP IT YEILDS EXACTLY MEASURED AND WEIGHED THEN AT THE SAME TIME LET ALSO ANOTHER HOLE BE BORED INTO THE N N N N BODY914 BODY OF THE TREE ABOUT 112 INCH DEEP AND SO ROUND ON EVERY SIDE OF THE SAME TREE AND OF OTHERS OF THE SAME SORT ALL EXHAUSTED OF THEIR SAP THE DAY BEFORE SOME DEEPER AND SOME SHALLOWER WITH A GOOD LARGE AUGER AND ONE QUITE THROUGH SLOAPING FROM THIS EXPERIMENT AFTER DIVERS AND VARIOUS TRIALS MAY BE FOUND THE DIFFERENCE OF THE SAP RISING ON THE NORTH AND SOUTH IN SUN AND SHADE AND SO LIKEWISE FROM THAT WHICH COMES FROM THE BARK AND THAT WHICH ASCENDS IN THE INNER PART OF THE TREE THE WEIGHT ALSO MAY BE COMPARED OF THAT WHICH ISSUES FROM THE BARK WITH THAT WHICH ISSUES FROM THE BODY THE IN TERNALL HEARTSAP MAY ALSO BE DRAWN APART BY BORING A SMALLER AUGERHOLE IN THE MIDLE OF A GREATER AND FITTING IT WITH A LONG PIPE ADJUSTED INTO THE INNER ORIFICE IF NO DIFFERENCE BE FOUND IN THESE BY DISTILLATION AFTER FERMENTATION NOR OTHERWISE THE PRESUMPTION WILL BE GREATER THAT THE DIFFERENCE OF HEART AS WHEN THEY CALL HEART OF OAK AND SAP IN TIMBER IS NOT FROM THE PLENTY OR SCARCITY OF SAP BUT FROM THE SEASON OF FELLING 2 FROM THE OBSERVATION OF THE WOODY CIRCLE OR PRICKS IN THE BRANCH ARM OR BODY OF A TREE IT MAY BE INQUIRED WHETHER AT SUCH TIME WHEN THAT CIRCLE FIRST ENCOMPASSD NEXT THE BARK THE TREE BE OR BE NOT MORE SUBJECT TO CORRUPTION THAN AT ANO THER SEASON WHEN THE JELLY OF THE JUYCE IS GROWN MORE CON DENSED I AM INFORMD BY A CURIOUS AND INTELLIGENT PERSON THAT THE CORRUPTION OF THE TIMBER DEPENDS NOT UPON THE TIME OF THE YEAR AND THE ASCENT OR THE PLENTY OR SCARCITY OF SAP SO MUCH AS UPON THE SEASON OF THE MOON OR WIND AND HE AFFIRMS THAT TIMBERTREES FELLD WHEN THE WIND IS IN THE WEST ESPE CIALLY IN THE OLD MOON WILL KEEP THEM FREE FROM GRUBS AS THEY CALL IT IE FROM BEING WORMEATEN AND ON THE CONTRA RY THAT WHEN CUT DOWN IN AN EAST WINDE THE WORM WILL SEIZE ON THEM IN WHAT SEASON OF THE MOON SOEVER IT BE FELLD TO PREVENT WHICH CORRUPTION TIS ADVISED THAT SUCH TIMBER SHOULD BE FORTHWITH THROWN INTO WATER ITS INDEED WORTH INQUIRING WHETHER WE MAY NOT ASCRIBE SOMTHING OF THE DURABLENESS OF TIMBER TO THE PERFECT CONDENSATION OF THE OUTWARD INTEGU MENT OR COAT AND SO TAKE CARE THAT WHEN TREES ARE TO BE FELLD FOR TIMBER OR OTHER DURABLE MATERIALS THE OUTWARD COATES MAY BE OF SOLID WOOD 3 ETHEL915 3 ETHELBERT JAY AN INGENIOUS AND EXPERT PLANTER IN LEMSTER SUPPOSETH THAT THE FITTEST TIRE TO INOCULATE IS PRESENTLY AFTER MIDSUMMER BECAUSE SAITH HE THE SAP DESCENDS BUT I SAY BECAUSE TIS THEN MOST PLENTIFUL AND BEGINS TO JELLY THE SAME ADSCRIBES IT TO THE SAP ASCENDING TO TAKE THE BUD INOCULAT D BEFORE MIDSUMMER AND TO THE SAP DESCENDING TO TAKE IT AFTER MIDSUMMER THE TIME HE LIMITS TO A FEW DAYS BEFORE MIDSUM MER AND TO 8 OR 10 DAYES AFTER IT MR AUSTIN LIMITS 14 DAYES BEFORE AND AS MANY AFTER AND WOULD HAVE THE BUD UN TYD AFTER 14 DAYS AS I REMEMBER 4 IT IS ALL ONE WHETHER THE SAP BE EXHAUSTED BELOW BY BEING CONVERTED INTO WOOD ROOTS OR OTHER USES OR BY DIVER SION AS WHEN THE BRANCH IS CUT OR THE BARK OPENED BELOW THE SAP IN BOTH CASES DESCENDS OR RATHER SINKS INDIFFERENTLY TO SUPPLY THE DEFECT AND HEAL THE WOUND AND SO IT COMS TO PASS THAT THERE BEING ABOUT MIDSUMMER THE GREATEST PLENTY OF SAP IN APPLE TREES A BUD THEN INOCULATED WILL THRIVE ESPE CIALLY BEFORE MIDSUMMER FOR THEN IT DRAWES ITS SHARE IN THE SAP ASCENDING AND ALL THE NECESSARY USES OF THE UPPER BRANCHES BEING SERVD IT PARTAKES OF THE FLOOD OF THE ABOUNDING AND SU PERFLUOUS SAP REMITTED TO IT FROM THEM 5 HENCE I CONCLUDE THAT TO GIRD A TREE AT A CONVENIENT DIS TANCE ABOVE THE INOCULATED BUD BEFORE MIDSUMMER SO AS IS PRACTISED TO STAY THE BLEEDING OF VINES TO GIRD THEM BELOW IS AN EXPERIMENT WORTH TRYING THAT WE MAY KNOW WHETHER IT WILL CAUSE A STRONGER SHOOT OF AN INOCULATED BUD OR NO OR WHETHER IT BE BETTER TO CUT OFF THE HEAD OF THE STOCK ABOVE THE INOCULATED BUD WHICH MY FRIEND INFORMES ME WILL MAKE A BETTER SHOOT THAN IN THE USUAL INOCULATION IF THIS BE DONE A FEW DAYES BEFORE MIDSUMMER FURTHER WHEN YOU GIRD IT MUST BE TRYED IN SEVERAL TREES WHETHER GIRDING LONG BEFORE MIDSUMMER WILL NOT STAY THE ASCENT OF THE SAP AND CUTTING OF THE HEAD MUCH MORE WHEREBY TIME MAY BE GAINED BY RETARDING THE SEASON OF INOCULATION TO THEIR BENEFIT WHO HAVE VERY MANY TO INOCULATE AND IN WET SEASON TO STAY FOR DRY WEA THER ONELY FIT FOR THIS WORK 6 IF THEN THE SAP IN ITS SUBSIDING BE SO CONSIDERABLE IN THE MATTER OF INOCULATION IT SEEMS THAT INOCULATION WILL HOLD BEST N NNN 2 AND916 AND LONGEST IN SEASON IN THE ROOT FOR I HAVE OBSERVED THE SAP TO SUBSIDE UNTO THE ROOTS OUT OF THE BODY AT SUCH TIMES OF THE DAY AND YEAR WHEN IN THE BRANCHES I FOUND NONE TO SPARE 7 IF BINDING OR CUTTING OFF THE HEAD ADVANCES THE SHOOT OF THE INOCULATED BUD THEN IT OUGHT TO BE EXPERIMENTED WHETHER DISBARKING A FEW DAYS BEFORE MIDSUMMER ON THE CONTRARIE SIDE A LITTLE BELOW THE BUD AND HAVING WAX AP PLYD OR CLAY ON THE PART DISBARKD MAY NOT BY THAT DIRECTION OF THE SAP NECESSITATING IT TO PASS BY THE BUD FURTHER ITS GROWTH CONSIDERABLY OR WHICH IS BETTER A GASH CUT IN THE WOOD IN THAT PLACE 8 TO MAKE A BARREN TREE BEARE AGAIN CHERISH DUNG IN TREN CHES AND PARE AND RENEW THE EXTREMITYS OF ITS LONGEST ROOTS AND CUT OFF THE OUTERMOST AND SHORTEST NEAREST THE BODY HENCE IT MAY SEEM THAT PLOWING HELPS FRUITTREES 9 CROSSE HACKINGS PROMOTE FRUITFULNESS CURE THE PHYLLO MANIA WHEREOF THE REASON SEEMS TO BE THAT AS WAS ABOVE INTI MATED OUTWARD CIRCLES AND BARK FEED THE WOOD AND THE INNER ONELY REACH OUT TO THE UTTERMOST SPRIGGS OF THE LAST YEAR TO WHICH THE FRUIT IS APPENDANT FOR SOME TREES BEAR ONLY ON THIS YEARS SHOOT AND SOME ONLY ON THAT OF THE LAST POSSIBLY SOME ONLY ON THE THIRD YEARS SHOOT AND CEASE BEARING WHEN THEY SHOOT NO NEW SPRIGGS SEASONABLE BARING THE ROOTS WHICH THEY CALL ABLAQUEATION PROBABLY HATH THE SAME EFFECT BECAUSE IT HINDERS THE NOURISHMENT ESPECIALLY OF THE OUTWARD COATES AND OF BARKE LEAVES AND SUCKERS BUT BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT AS SOME SUCKERS OR SHOOTS LATELY SPRUNG IN OUTWARD COATS ROBB THE FRUIT OF THE RISEN IUYCE SO LATER ROOTS COME FROM THE OUTWARD PARTS OF THE MAINE ROOTS ROB THEM ALSO OF THEIR FIRST NOURISHMENT IN THE EARTH THEY OUGHT TO BE PRU NED AS WELL AS ALL SUCKERS AND NOTBEARING BRANCHES AND SPRIGGS EVERY YEAR FOR WHICH REASON ALSO THE BETTER TO INCREASE AND AMEND FRUIT IT MAY BE OBSERVED WHAT WAS RECOMMEN DED ABOVE TO THE 15TH QUERIE VIZ THE APPLYING OF DUNG AND OTHER AMENDMENTS IN TRENCHES NIGH TO AND BEYOND THE FARTHEST POINTS OF THE ROOTS TO DRAW THEM OUT OF THE SHADE AND DROPS TO THIS END DISTANCE AND SITUATION IS TO BE OBSERVED 10 ONE917 10 ONE OF THE BEST WAYS OF OBTAINING THE GREATEST STORE OF SAP IN THE SHORTEST TIME FROM THE BODY OF ANY TREE IS NOT ONLY TO PIERCE THE BARK NOT TO CUT THE BODY WITH A CHIZEL ALMOST TO THE PITH AS SOME HAVE DIRECTED BUT QUITE THOROW ALL THE CIRCLES AND THE INNER RIND IT SELF ON BOTH SIDES OF THE PITH LEAVING ONLY THE OUTERMOST CIRCLE AND THE BARK ON THE NORTHEASTSIDE UNPIERCED BUT THIS HOLE IS TO BE BORED SLOAPING UPWARDS AS LARGE AS THE BIGGEST AUGER YOU CAN GET WILL MAKE AND THAT ALSO THOROUGH AND UNDER A LARGE ARM NEAR THE GROUND SO WILL IT NOT NEED ANY STONE TO KEEP OPEN THE ORIFICE NOR SPIGOT TO DIRECT THE SAP INTO THE RECEIVER THIS WAY THE TREE WILL IN SHORT TIME AF FORD LIQUOR ENOUGH TO BREW WITH IT AND WITH SOME OF THESE SWEET SAPS ONE BUSHELL OF MALT WILL MAKE AS GOOD ALE AS FOUR BUSHELS WITH ORDINARY WATER THOUGH YOU SHOULD BREW EVEN IN MARCH HELD THE PROPEREST TIME FOR BREWING IN REGARD OF THE GOODNESS OF THE WATER AT THAT SEASON SYCAMORE I TAKE TO YEILDTHE BEST BREWING SAP BEING VERY SWEET AND WHOLESOM 11 TO PRESERVE SAP IN THE BEST CONDITION FOR BREWING WHAT YOU GATHER FIRST MUST BE INSOLATED BY A CONSTANT EXPO SURE OF IT TO THE SUN IN GLASSES OR OTHER FIT VESSELS TILL THE REST BE GATHERD AND READY OTHERWISE IT WILL SOON CONTRACT AN ACIDITY HAVING BEEN THUS EXPOSD TO THE SUN TILL A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY IS COLLECTED PUT INTO IT SO MUCH VERY THIN CUT AND HARD TOSTED BUT NO WAYS BURNT RYBREAD AS WILL SERVE TO FER MENT IT AND WHEN IT WORKS TAKE OUT THE BREAD AND BOTLE THE LIQUOR STOPPING IT UP WITH WAXED CORKS IF YOU BAKE SAGE OR ANY OTHER MEDICINAL HERBS IN SUCH THIN RYPASTE TILL THEY BE VERY DRY YOU MAY EXPECT A VERY WHOLESOME DRINK IF YOU PUT A FEW CLOVES IN EVERY GLASS INTO WHICH THE SAP RUNS FROM THE TREE IT WILL CERTAINLY KEEP A TWELF MONTH BUT I HAVE WONDERD WHILEST I OBSERVD HOW SPEE DILY IT DREW THE TAST AND TINCTURE OF THE CLOVE IN SOME FEW BOTTLES I WAS SO HAPPY AS TO DRAW OUT MY CLOVES WITH A CLOTH IN WHICH I TYED THEM UP IN SUCH A SEASON AS NOT TO CHANGE COLOUR NOR TASTE AND YET I PRESERVD THE BIRCHSAP BY THAT MIGHT FERMENTATION ABOVE A TWELF MONTH WITHOUT ANY ALTERATIONS WHICH ELSE WOULD HAVE SOWRD IN A FEW DAYS 2 SOME918 12 SOME PROPOSE OYLE OF SULPHUR TO PERFUME THE BOTTLES WITH I KNOW NOT WHETHER THAT ALTER THE TAST OR ONELY STAY THE NATURALL FERMENTATION OR WHAT OTHER CHANGE IT GIVES THE SAP 13 SPIRIT OF WINE FERMENTS THE IUYCE OF SOME BERRIES AND POSSIBLY MAY NOT ONLY PRESERVE BUT ADVANCE THE VERTUE OF SAPS A LITTLE BEING POWRED ON THE TOP OF THEM IN THE BOTLES OR SOME OTHER OILY SPIRIT 14 RAISINS INFUSED IN THE LIQUOR OF BIRCH IS ONE INGREDIENT OF THE DURHAMGARDNER I HAVE BEEN INFORMD THAT HE USES SUGAR BUT I BELIEVE HE PUTS IT NOT IN TILL HE OPENS A BOTLE PRESENTLY TO BE DRUNK BECAUSE IT MAKETH THE LIQUOR SPARKLE IN THE GLASSE 15 A CERTAIN LADY FERMENTS IT WITH RYTOST NOT PUT IN BUT ONLY HUNG OVER IT IN SUCH QUANTITY AND AT SUCH DISTANCE AS MAY GIVE SOME LIGHT WARMTH MOTION AND ALTERATION TO THE SURFACE OF THE LIQUOR 16 I FERMENTED SOME WITH ALEBARM WHICH CONVERTED MY DELICAT BIRCHIUYCE KEPT IN BOTTLES INTO PITIFULL SMALL BEER WHICH I WONDRED AT FOR I KNOW ONE WHO USED BY THE BARM OF ALE TO IMPROVE SMAL BEER AND THEREBY TO KEEP IT THE BETTER IN VESSELS 17 I PERSUADE MY SELF THAT BIRCHWATER FERMENTED BY THE FLEMISH WHEATFERMENT WITHOUT ANY BARM WOULD IN TIME BE EXCELLENTLY MATURD IN BOTTLES BUT NOT IN A SMALL TIME 18 LET CYNAMON ALSO BE TRYD AMONG THE FERMENTS OF THESE IUYCES HONY WILL NOT MIXE WITH CYDER THOUGH BOYLD THEREIN TO MAKE MEATH BUT AFTER A WHILE THE CYDER LETS FALL THE HONY AND BECOMES SIMPLE CYDER AGAIN Q WHETHER IT WILL NOT BE SO ALSO IN BIRCH SAP 19 SOME AFFIRM THAT THE TOPS AND LEAVES OF BIRCH DECOCTED IN THE SAP WILL PRESERVE IT FROM SOWRING THE WHOLE YEAR AND THAT ANY SORT OF DRYD AROMATICK HERBS AS SAGE C BOYLED IN BEER WILL KEEP IT AS WELL AS HOPS LING HEATH BROOM OR WORMWOOD I HAD A FRIEND WHO USD BAYLEAVES IN HIS BEER AND ALE THESE THINGS I PROPOSE TO TRYALL WITH GREEN LEAVES AND TOPS OF THE SAME YEAR DECOCT AND DRY LEAVES AND HERBS INFUSD OR BOYLD OR FORMER THE INNER BARK YIELDS OYLE AND PROBABLY WHEN INFUSD WILL PRESERVE IUYCES SO YOU HAVE OYLE VINEGAR AND WINE FROM OUR OWN NATIVE TREES 20 DELICATE919 20 DELICATE AND LIGHT FRENCH MINCHET TOSTED MAY POSSI BLY BE ALSO GOOD FOR OUR SAPPS 21 FOR THE CLEARING OF WHAT WAS DELIVERED NUM 43 P 858 AB UT PRICKT CIRCLES IN TREES IT MAY BE ADDED THAT THOSE CIRCLES ARE SUPPOSD TO BE AT SOME TIME OF THE YEAR OF ONE SIN GLE ROW OF PRICKS AND AT SOME SEASON OF MORE AND AT OTHERS OF SOLID WOOD QUERE 1 WHAT ALTERATION IS FOUND IN CIRCLES OF PRICKS OR WOOD IN SPRING AT MIDSUMMER AND IN AU TUMN C 2 WHETHER THESE SINGLE OR DOUBLE CIRCLES OF PRICKS AND COATS OF IELLY OR WOOD INCREASE BETWIXT THE INNER AND OUTWARD BARK OR NOT OR BETWIXT THE ONE AND BOTH OF THE BARKS I E ON ONE OR BOTH SIDES OF THE INNER BARK I CONCEIVE IT DOTH ON BOTH SIDES OF THE INNER BARK SO THAT IN SOME THICK OUTWARD BARKS THOSE CIRCLES MAY BE OBSERVD AS IN WOOD 3 WHETHER THE TREE RECEIVES INCREASE IN ALL ITS INNER COATS SO AS EVERY COAT YEARLY GROWS THICKER OR IN THE OUTTERMOST ONLY OF IN SOME OF THE OUTWARD COATS ALSO

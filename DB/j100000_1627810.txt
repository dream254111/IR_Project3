 Our Forest iReserva tions by J W Tourney in which the subject is discussed from various points of view David Starr Jordan presents the second instalment of The Blood of the Nation showing how the slaughter of the flower of the nation in war contributes to the survival of the unfit and Robert H Thurston gives the concluding por tion of his paper on  Progress and Tendency of Mechanical Engineering in the Nineteenth Century Jas Lewis Howe discusses The Periodic Law and Henry A Rowlands A Plea for Pure Science is republished as a tribute to his memory while Gary N Calkins treats at

the branch to which a nest with young birds is attached to some accessible spot near by a green tent from which the birds are observed and photographed at a short distance The final article is the

series of  Birds and Seasons  treats of the forms to be observed from Boston to Stockton Cal incidentally including the statement that Dr W L Ralph is to continue the  Life Histories of North American Birds which was begun by the late Major Bendire Among the various articles in the different departments is one of special interest entitled A Connecticut Game Peserve by Willard G Van Name which hints at a successful method of increasing the birds by making a reservation where they are protected at all seasons and fed during winter and whence they spread into adjacent terri tory N S VOL XIII No 337 SOCIETIES AND ACADEMIES THE NEW YORK SECTION OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY THE regular meeting of the New York Sec tion of the American Chemical Society was held May 10th at the Chemists Club 108 West 55th Street Dr C A Doremus presiding The following papers were read The Quantitative Determination of Cadmium by E H Miller and R W Page On the Relation of Chemical Constitution to the Physiological Action of Certain Modern Anaesthetics by W E Dreyfus Alloys of Titanium and Titanium Steel  by A J Rossi a Chemical Nature of the Enzymes b  Note on Nucleic Acid by P A Levene read by Dr S Bookman Analysis of Garden Sage with Notes on the De termination of Essential Oils by L L Watters Each of the papers received some discussion A communication was read from the chair man of the New York Section of Chemical In dustry relative to the appointment by that body of a committee to secure  uniformity in technical analysis and stating that a sub committee had been appointed to investigate the analysis of Portland Cement Also that work on this line had commenced and that members of the New York Section of the American Chemical Society were invited to co operate It was moved and seconded that the matters be brought before the council with the recom mendation that a committee be appointed to cooperate with the committee of the Society of Chemical Industry It was also voted that the chairman of the New York Section be returned as a loeal dele gate to the council of the Society provided he be not already a member of the council as delegateatlarge DURAND WOODMAN Secretary DISCUSSION AND CORRESPONDENCE THE MOTION OF A TOP THE elementary explanations of this motion generally labor under the difficulty which at tended the explanations of the late Professor Pliny Earle Chase that is they need an exJUNE 14 1901 SCIENCE planation Such a result might be expected when we consider the difficulties of the question The student should understand that he must face the difficulties and that he can not over come them without serious study A good analytical exposition will be found in the  Me canique of Poisson But the most satisfac tory investigation of such motions is given by Poinsot by means of the theory of couples An interesting example is that of the pre cession and nutation of the equinoxes If we form the couples around the earths axis of rotation around the line of equinoxes and around the line in the earths equator directed toward the solstice we find that the couple around the axis of rotation is zero the couple around the line of equinoxes gives the preces sion and the couple around the other axis pro duces the nutation By substituting the force arising from the action of the sun expanding by the binomial theorem and retaining only the first terms the solar precession comes out 156 in a year The calculation for the moon is not so easy because the moon does not move in the ecliptic but since we can compound couples like forces there is no difficulty except the length of the work The precession pro duced by the moon is 348 hence the sum or the lunisolar precession is 504 Observa tion gives 5035 this simple method therefore gives a good approximation to the true value The mass of the earth disappears when we compound the couples and the precession would be the same if the earth were a shell of the same figure The precession has a secular character since when we integrate we find a constant factor multiplied by the time Again since the precession is negative the dynamical result shows that the earth is flattened at the poles and not elongated as Cassini thought The nutation can be found in the same way from the couple around the third axis but it has a periodical character and changes sign with the longitude of the moon The computed value agrees well with observation Poinsots work is a remarkable example of what can be done by the careful study and ex amination of the geometrical conditions of a question A HALL CAMBRIDGE May 31 1901 MODULUS OF CONSTANT CROSS SECTION To THE EDITOR OF SCIENCE In the last number of SCIENCE there appears a short article with the above heading in which the author says he can find no mention anywhere of a modu lus of constant cross section The modulus here referred to will be found in a number of treatises on elasticity among others the article Elasticity in  Encyclopaedia Brittanica Vol VII p 807 and Rankines Applied Me chanics p 279 where a numerical value is quoted for brass If k be the volume modulus and n the rigidity modulus the modulus for constant cross section is k  4 n The author may profit by the study of the thermodynamics of elasticity as given in the  Britannica  article THOMAS GRAY ROSE POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE May 27 1901 NOTE ON THE GENUS HOLLANDIA OF KARSCH IN reading over the sixth volume of the Cam bridge Natural History Insects by Dr David Sharp p 396 the writer notes the following statement  The tropical African Arbelidse are considered by Karsch to be a distinct family Hollandiidae  Upon looking up the matter I discover that Dr F Karsch in the twentysecond volume of the  Entomologische Nachrichten 1896 p 137 erected a genus in honor of Dr W J Holland of Pittsburgh calling it Hollandia and select ing as the type of the genus the species named and described by him as Hollandia togoica He further made this genus the type of a new family the Hollandiidae to which he referred the genera Hollandia Karsch Arbelodes Karsch Lebedodes Holland and Metarbela Holland Dr Karsch unfortunately overlooked the fact that in the Annals and Magazine of Natural History for October 1892 p 295 Dr Arthur G Butler had already described a genus of African moths naming it Hollandia in honor of the same gentleman whom Dr Karsch states it to be his wish to recognize Dr Karschs name therefore falls into the list of synonyms together with the family name which he has proposed The writer suggests for the genus described 949

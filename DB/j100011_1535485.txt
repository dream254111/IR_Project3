structures of regenerated posterior limbs in the Anura have been found to be capable of almost complete restoration I know of no similar studies on the anterior limbs As the anterior limbs of Anurous batrachians appear relatively late in the life of the larvae some interest attaches to the power of regeneration possessed by these organs That the lost regions of the anterior limbs may be restored more or less completely has already been proven1 but how com pletely the skeleton can be restored within the various limb regions it is the purpose of this article to show The many less complete instances of regeneration which are of frequent occur rence after amputation of the anterior limb have been omitted from consideration A comparison of the regenerated skeletons seen in Figs 2 and 3 with the normal skeleton figured in I shows that the skel etal structures are often less completely regenerated than might be expected from the outward appearance of the limb In both cases there is a tendency not only to reduction in the number of digits in the regenerated hands but also to a reduction in the number of phalanges in each digit The relatively greater length of the middle digit in both 2 and 3 marks it as undoubtedly the fourth digit though in each case but three phalanges are present while in the normal limb there are four A similar reduction of parts likewise occurs in the fifth digit of both 2 and 3 which normally is also composed of four phalanges In the case of the remaining digit in the regenerated hands I am unable to determine whether it is the third or the second digit that has regenerated In Fig 2 the digit contains the normal number of phalanges whether it be 1 Byrnes E F  Regeneration of the Anterior Limbs in the Tadpoles of Frogs Archiv fir

fourth and fifth and in its rela tively short length suggests the third digit while the relatively greater length of the corresponding digit in 2 suggests that it may be the second In both 2 and 3 the rudimentary pollyx is present In the carpal region there is but little differentiation in FIG I The skeleton of a regen erated hand FIG 2 A normal skeleton of an anterior forearm and hand The striped are as are cartilaginous the regenerated limbs there being but little ossification in the cartilage in 2 and no ossification whatever in the carpal region of 3 A striking feature in the regenerated limbs is the constant appearance of the rudimentary pollyx Sometimes this is repre sented by a separate cartilaginous structure as in Fig 3 while in other cases it is a mere projection from the fused cartilaginous carpalia as in Fig 2 Even in hands that are greatly reduced and distorted after regeneration the cartilaginous projection of the pollyx often persists as in Fig 4 I67ESTHER F BYRNES After regeneration the double nature of the radioulnare is in variably strongly marked by a deep groove showing the line of demarkation between the ulnar and the radial regions There is no trace of where the amputation occurred the regenerated end being perfectly normal in proportion and showing complete continuity with the upper part of the bone While the frog larvae were regenerating the imperfect limbs whose skeletal structures are shown in the text figures similar experiments were made on some Amzblystoma larvae about three A vllp FIG 3 The skeleton of a regener ated hand FIG 4 The skeleton of a partly regenerated anterior hand P the pollyx C the carpus months old As soon as an Amblystoma had regenerated the lost limb the regenerated limb was again amputated so that toward the close of the experiments the Amblystomne were in possession of perfectly formed limbs after having regenerated five in rapid succession Each of the five limbs was not only normal in form and in the number of its parts but it was also normal in size the larvae apparently having suffered no loss of power even tempo rarily to completely recover from the injury i68REGENERATED ANTERIOR LIMBS IN THE FROG Early observers1 have shown that in the Urodeles the second digit is the first to appear in the process of regeneration then the first and subsequently the third and fourth digits More re cently Ridewood has recorded a similar sequence in the develop ment of the regenerated digits of the posterior limb of the midwife toad The concealed position of the anterior limb in the gillchamber in the frog makes the observation of sequence in the develop ment of the digits difficult but in the anterior limb that region which appears first in the posterior limb of the toad and of the Urodele is the one that in the frog is often wholly lacking Ridewood2 has figured a case of regeneration in the skeleton of the posterior limb of the toad that shows that the limb is in herently capable of complete regeneration and doubtless regenera tion of the anterior limb may be much more complete in the frog than would appear from Figs 2 and 3 Inasmuch however as these figures illustrate regeneration after amputation of the ante rior limb when it was but very imperfectly formed they indicate a marked tendency toward early loss of regenerative power BROOKLYN NEW YORK March 1904 1 Gotte A Ueber

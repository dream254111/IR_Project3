FROM THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF NATURALISTS THE American Society of Naturalists does not possess a complete set of its published Records It has no copy of Part IV Vol ume II The secretary wishes to complete at least one set of the Records to be de posited with other material at the Wistar Institute Several complete sets may be made up if copies of the following can be obtained Volume I Parts II III IV V VII VIII IX and XI Volume II Parts I II IV V VI and VII Members of the society are therefore asked to look through their papers and to write to the secretary if they can supply any of the parts desired BRADLEY MOORE DAVIS Secretary for 1913 UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA PHILADELPHIA PA THE FACTS ABOUT THE ACCOUNTS OF LEARNED SOCIETIES To THE EDITOR OF SCIENCE The article by Professor Hart in SCIENCE for January 10 contains errors that need correction The financial report of the American Academy of Political and Social Science for the year 1910 has been compared with the reports of the other societies for 1911 although the Academys financial statement for 1911 was printed in May 1912 eight months before Professor Harts article appeared The apparent discrepancy between mem bership list and paying members is due to the fact that Professor Hart fails to take into ac count the 128 life members and 503 subscrib ers of the Academy represented mainly by libraries and other institutions not eligible to membership 371 The statement is made in the article that the expenditure of the Academy per paying member was 671 for the year 1910 This calculation is not based on the true figures for membership and suppresses the fact that 1049300 was received from subscriptions to publications by nonmembers from sales of current numbers from special contributions and from lifemembership fees The number of pages published during the year 1910 is said to be 1523 when in fact 2034 pages were printed The number of words published in 1910 was 1176650 and not 685000 as stated in the article The details are as follows 37300 copies of Annals issued in 1910 1500 copies of Annals reprinted 10700 copies of a Child Labor supplement 27800 copies of four issues of supplements 9500 copies of reprints The average cost of printing per 1000 words was 1637 and not 3250 but included in this cost are items not directly chargeable to the printing of the Annals as will be seen by the enumeration in the report Such are the facts about the American Academy Professor Harts statements about the American Historical Association are also incorrect The proceedings are printed and sent out at government expense and hence it has no postage bills of this sort in its ac counts The association does not print its own magazine but has a contract with a pub lishing house which issues it at a net rate to the members of the association The receipts for advertising and subscriptions are thus not accounted for in the report of the society nor does it contain the bills for postage and for clerical help employed by the publishing house These net costs can not fairly be com pared with the gross costs tabulated in the annual report of the American Academy SIMON N PATTEN IS THE  ACADEMIC COSTUME WORTH WHILE To THE EDITOR OF SCIENCE I shall not at tempt to answer the above question raised by Professor Wilder in your issue of January 31 But if the question had been worded Is MARCH 7 1913N S VOL XXXVII No 949 the academic costume worth paying 35 to 95 for I would quickly answer No Considering it desirable to provide myself with a doctors gown and hood I purchased the silk and velvet trimming by the yard and got a dressmaker to make the gown after the pattern of one owned by a friend As a result I have a firstclass gown of the best material and the cost was about half the regular price of a similar gown ready made J SCIENTIFIC BOOKS Michigan Bird Life a List of the Bird Species known to Occur in the State To gether With an Outline of their Classifica tion and an Account of the Life History of Each Species with Special Reference to its Relation to Agriculture With seventyfive full page plates and one hundred and fifty two text figures By WALTER BRADFORD BARROWS SB Professor of Zoology and Physiology and Curator of the General Mu seum Special Bulletin of the Department of Zoology and Physiology of the Michigan Agriculture College Published by the Michigan Agricultural College 1912 8vo Pp xiv  822 70 halftone plates and 152 text figures The purpose and general character of the present work are stated by the author to be to provide an authoritative list of the birds of Michigan with such additional information respecting them as would be useful and of in terest not only to the nature lover and general reader but to students and teachers In a work originating with and published by a State Agricultural College it is eminently proper that special attention should be given to the economic status of the species in rela tion to mans interests yet it is recognized that each has  a scientific an esthetic a hu man value which can not be estimated in dol lars and cents and which should forever pro tect it  from extreme persecution and above all from final extinction An introduction of nearly thirty pages deals with the physiographic and climatic fea tures of the state the distribution of its plant and animal life and especially its bird life with reference to the different areas char acterized by special conditions of environ ment as prairies marshes and pine and hard wood forests The subject how to study birds  is discussed at some length and with intelligence and fairness the conclusion being that fieldglass records of rare species by ama teurs should not be relied upon as satisfactory evidences of occurrence Where there is any improbability of a bird being at a given time and place the record should rest upon an actual specimen taken at that locality and either preserved for the examination of any one interested or at least examined and identi fied by a competent authority before being destroyed Nearly ten pages are given to the subject of migration which includes not only comment on the migratory movements of birds in Mich igan but a summary of recent progress in knowledge of bird migration remarks on the rapidity of flight in birds and on t4e disas ters known to overtake birds in migration by which thousands upon thousands lose their lives through adverse weather conditions so that large areas become nearly depopulated of certain species Attention is also called to recent changes in the bird life of Michigan through deforestation of large portions of the state the draining of marshes etc and the consequent increase or decrease of certain species The main text of the work treats in syste matic sequence of the 326 species of birds known to occur in the state with keys to the species and higher groups a liberal amount of biographical matter followed by diagnoses in small type The life histories are especially full with often somewhat extended discussion of the economic relations of the species to agriculture for which the author is especially fitted by his twentyfive years of study of the complex relations of birds to insects and crops as a specialist in this field first under the United States Department of Agriculture and later at Michigan Agricultural College A  hypothetical list of 62 species of birds that have been attributed to Michigan by previous 372 SCIENCE

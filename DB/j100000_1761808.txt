Convocation of the University of the state of New York The organization of that body is so peculiar as to be hardly understood in other states and a word in respect to it may inter est our readers The regents of the univer sity are charged by the state with certain functions which pertain to the control of the academies and high schools of the state and with a mild oversight of the universities and colleges Once a year the regents invite the heads of all these institutions and representa tives of the faculties to assemble in the senate chamber in Albany and discuss such subjects as may be of special importance to the educa tional concerns of the state This is known as the Convocation Formal papers are read addresses are made and deceased teachers are commemorated but probably the most useful feature of the gathering is the discussion of selected topics by appointed speakers in the presence of a company of specially interested auditors For example at the convocation on the 9th of July the chancellor of the university left the chair which was taken by the presi dent of Hamilton university who introduced the topic of the day  college discipline The theme which he opened was discussed by the heads of several other leading institutions in the state The contrast between such an edu cational conference and the great conventions of teachers is very marked The talking is not for the outside public though anybody may be present who wishes and the reports in the newspapers are very brief but the parties in terested learn to know one another They compare their views as experts and give and take suggestions as to the theory and practice of the work with which they are charged No No 129 1885 mercantile element is allowed or in less euphonious phrase no bookagents are allowed any privileges in these assemblies OUR READERS ARE WELL AWARE that early in June the memorial statue of Charles Darwin by Boehm toward the erection of which pop ular contributions were received from many lands was unveiled in its permanent site in the great hall of the new naturalhistory mu seum of South Kensington An appropriate address was delivered on that occasion by Professor Huxley president of the Royal so ciety We refer to the subject again for the sake of calling attention to one incidental but not unimportant feature in the ceremony the presence of men from almost all parties and shades of religious opinion among English protestants The appearance of the Prince of Wales the Archbishop of Canterbury the Dean of Westminster Mr Beresford Hope Arch deacon Farrar not to name any others is enough to show that the  establishment is not unwilling to honor the great naturalist of our age When the obloquy encountered a few years ago by  Darwinism  obloquy not yet entirely dormant in some portions of the United States is borne in mind the list of those who assembled on this occasion is as gratifying as the statement that contributions to the memorial were received from fifteen countries besides the three kingdoms and the British colonies AN UNFORTUNATE CONTROVERSY has arisen in the ranks of the medical profession of this country with respect to the meeting of the ninth International medical congress It is a controversy however in which all scientific men among us are interested Indeed the good name of American hospitality is involved in its settlement The International congress which meets triennially had determined to meet in Washington in 1887 It is an assoSCIENCE elation of the highest character and dignity the meetings of which for many years past have been attended by the ablest men of the profession Great benefits as well as great pleasure were anticipated from their assem bling in this country The American medical association having a national name and a na tional constituency appointed a select and judicious committee of arrangements and this committee having made good progress in their plans and having secured the promises of co operation from a large number of the profes sion reported what they had done to the American medical association at its recent meeting in New Orleans The report was re ceived with unexpected disapprobation in which it is not too much to say that personal and geographical jealousies were apparent Another committee was appointed which sub sequently met at Chicago and  upset nearly all that had been done so carefully by the first committee Now it appears that the first committee though its work was  upset com mands in fact much more confidence from the profession than the second The gentle men invited by the new committee to cooperate have begun forthwith to make excuse In Washington Baltimore Boston and Philadel phia  and perhaps in other places from which we have not heard  men of the highest pro fessional standing and personal character decline to act with the revolutionary party Their cards have been made public and have begun to attract attention from the daily press It now looks as if the revolters would not command the situation Certainly men of eminence abroad will be slow to accept an in vitation to an international congress upon this side of the Atlantic if a large number of the most eminent physicians snd surgeons of this country widely known professionally as well as personally have been treated with discour tesy in the preliminary arrangements and are therefore compelled to stand aloof It does not look as if the new committee could enlist the general cooperation essential to suc cess and particularly because their authority VOL VI No 129 is exercised in what appears to be the spirit of hostile reflection upon measures already ini tiated against which no good objection has been made The only solution of the problem seems to be for the second committee to ac knowledge their inability to form a govern ment and stand aside allowing the original committee to go forward and perfect their plans either in the name of the American medical association or in the name of the profession at large by some concerted action which there is time enough to mature The latter alterna tive seems to us most likely to be successful DURING THE PAST DECADE Professor Elias Loomis of Yale college has read a series of twentyone papers entitled  Contributions to meteorology before the National academy of sciences The material for these studies has been drawn largely from the publications of the signalservice and especially from the daily weathermaps which now present so great an accumulation of observations that extremely accurate conclusions can be drawn from them The results thus gained as pub lished in the American journal of science constitute the chief source of generalized knowledge that a student can now consult con cerning the behavior of cyclonic storms in this country on which daily weatherchanges depend so largely The work has been throughout characterized by careful and dis criminating methods and forms as excellent an example of inductive research as can be placed before a student for a model When put to gether the  contributions  now make a con siderable volume and form a fitting sequel to the early papers on the same subjects written by Professor Loomis nearly half a century ago IN THE RECENT REPORT of the Yalecollege observatory Dr Waldo complains and appar ently with great justice that the legislature of Connecticut at its last session suddenly ter minated its contract with the observatory  for timeservice to the state at large He says that this action was taken without a hearingJULY 24 1885 SCIE from the railroad commissioners the manufac turers of clocks and watches the mayors or other authorities in the cities of the state the telephone and telegraph companies or the observatory He states that no reason for this action was given except economy and he claims that the observatory should be at least reimbursed for the considerable expense which it had incurred in preparation for this service Unless there is some reason for the action of the general assembly not apparent to us its conduct is certainly most discredit able to a state so intelligent and so wealthy as Connecticut Nobody can believe that the moderate charge upon the treasury in return for a service of such universal advan tage can have been burdensome It is more likely that the action was due to a lack of acquaintance with the points involved or to the prejudice of some individual It is re markable that a state which may almost be called the land of the clockmaker should by its official action throw contempt upon ac curate timekeeping Such jerky legislation is what the state universities of the west are wonted to but nobody expected it in a matter like this from the land of steady habits The first of steady habits is fidelity to an engage ment real or implied and the second is like unto it  punctuality in all matters where time is an element in the obligation LETTERS TO THE EDITOR   Correspondents are requested to be as brief as possible The writers name is in all cases required as proof of good faith Untimely death of a chippingsparrow THE following tragic event occurred in the village of Wake Forest on the 15th of June The nest was near completion the lining of hair was being put in Somehow in the midst of this process the sparrows head became entangled in one end of a long horse hair the other end of which had been securely woven into the bottom of the nest When he rose to go the halfknot tightened round his neck and poor chippy was found dangling some twelve inches below the nest hung by the neck and quite dead I am told that a similar event occurred here a day or two after that stated above In this case however the sparrow was hung by a cotton string and was found so soon after the mishap that he was released having suffered little harm Wake Forest college North Carolina NCE 63 The Washington monument and the lightning stroke of June 5 By one who was near its base the stroke of lightning which injured the Washington monument is remem bered as a ball of fire coming towards him Does not this observation explain the ball of fire so often reported  An electric spark passing between two points will to a circle of observers present various appearances If two inches long it will be seen as a line of fire two inches long by some while to those in the line of its motion it will be a single spark So when a flash of lightning a line of fire is direct ed toward the observer it must appear as a ball of fire motionless if the movement is directly toward the observer moving with comparative slowness if slightly off that direction and with electric rapidity if across the field of view at right angles with the line to the observers place M C MEIGS Washington DC Volcanic dust east of the Rocky Mountains My attention has recently been called to the in teresting letter of Mr George P Merrill in Science for April 24 on Volcanic dust from southwestern Nebraska and his subsequent paper on the same in the Proceedings of the U S national museum 1885 pp 99 100 Since Mr Merrill seems not to be aware of any earlier published notice of similar volcanic dust found east of the RockyMountain region a short note may not be amiss here In October 1882 my friend and colleague Mr Samuel Garman placed in my hands for examination a fine gray sand found in Dakota This on exami nation was seen to be composed of volcanic glass in shards tubes etc mostly waterclear but a few forms contained glass inclusions and vapor cavities A few grains were brown like many of the rhyolitic glasses many were ribbed or thicker on one side thinning down to an edge on the other others were apparently of uniform thickness and none gave evi dence of being wind or water worn A very little earthy material was found mixed with the volcanic ash Mr Garman gave an account of this deposit of glass before the Boston scientific society Nov 8 1882 and a notice of it was published in the Boston transcript for Nov 10 Attention was further called to this glass in my  Lithological studies published early in November last on p 17 Mr Garman has given me the following information regarding the deposit   It was found about fifty miles south by east from the Black Hills between the Niobrara and the White rivers just north of the watershed not far from the head of Antelope Creek The bed is horizontal and as I remember it nearly two feet in thickness at its thickest portion and several rods in extent The deposits in the immediate neighborhood are late ter tiary A small stream had cut away the bank in which the glass lay exposing a considerable portion of it From the exposed edge the powdery material is carried away by the wind as a fine smokelike dust The glass in the bed is as clean as in the sample except near the upper and lower surfaces where it is mixed with other matter To be so clean it must have been deposited by water almost free from other impurities for the winds would have mingled other dust with it M E WADSWORTH W L POTEAT Museum of comparative zoilogy Cambridge Mass July 9

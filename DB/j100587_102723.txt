Scipio desMoulins to Dr Hans Sloane R S Secr concerning a Mineral Water at Canterbury A Bout twelve Years ago a Mineral Water was acciden tally detected in this City In digging the Ground they first met with a fat black Mold extending it self three Foot deep and gradually changing into another sort of Earth very fat and like Butter This second Lay was two Foot thick the Colour of it Yellow something mixt its Odour strong and Mineral and a piece of it being for some time exposd to the Sun smelld much like burn ing Sulphur After this they found a Quicksand of a darker Colour than the first Earth mixd with several lit tle Stones and the Smell still stronger than before Two Foot2463 Foot further under the Quicksand a hard Rock ap peard out of which Water gushd with some Violence They dug two Wells at about 7 Feet distance from each other one about eight or nine Feet deep from its Surface and twelve from the Surface of the Ground about it and reacheth the Rock Tother is not so deep by two Foot and only toucheth the Sand This last is something stronger of the Sulphur but the other is stronger of the Mineral Spirit and ferruginous parts Two Drams of the second Lay of Earth found in dig ging being put into four Ounces of Spirit of Vinegar there presently arose a considerable Ebullition and soon after the Spirit was tingd with a yellow brownish Co lour which sufferd no alteration with the Infusion of Logwood nor with Galls but with Oyl of Tart p deliq turnd greenish and with the Infusion of Lig neph of a pale red The Water taken up at the Spring is extraordinary limpid but grows something whitish in a quarter of an Hour and in half an Hour the Spirit is lost and the Mi neral hangs first on the sides of the Glass and then falls gradually to the Bottom It wont keep quite so well as the Spaw or Tunbridge Water Its Taste is masculine and austere the Smell ferruginous and strong something up on the Sulphur People say it smells like Gunpowder It will make the Root of the Tongue of the Drinkers look blackish Linnen washd in it turns yellow It will not lather with Soap The Glasses the Water is dippd with grow yellow which no scowering can take off and are apt to fly In frosty and cold Weather it is so warm as to melt Ice and Snow in other Seasons its cold though not so cold as some Spring Waters are The weight of this Water varies much according to to the Seasons and Weather In May 1704 it weighed three Grains lighter than Common Water in the quantity of a Pound In the Spring of 1705 it was equal in weight to1464 Common Water and is now still heavier in August fol lowing because of the exceeding dry Weather of that Summer But in general about Midsummer if the Wea ther is no ways extraordinary its pretty equal to com mon Water in weight A single Grain weight of good Gall will turn a Pint and a half of this Water of a very noble deep red and in an instant Syrup of Violets turns it of a Grass green With the Infusion of Brasile it giveth a deep lively Blue With that of Lign nephr first a light Green then a light Yellow with a Blue Crown With the Infusion of Log wood a blue Black With that of Fustick Wood a dusky Yellow With the Flowers of Pomgranates a fair Violet With Leaves of Thea a fine purplish Blue With good Nants Brandy an Elegant Skycolour It turns a Solution of the Sacch Saturn Milky in an Instant and the Solution of Sublimate in some time longer Ol tart per deliq sp Sal Armon sp Vitr c make no sensible alteration In Calm Weather in Winter especially a thick oyly Film covers the surface of these Waters of as great a va riety of Colours as a Rainbow a Spoonful of it drunk hath the effect of and composeth as much to Sleep as a moderate Dose of Opium Some of this Scum being dry ed by Evaporation tasted very fat and felt so between the Fingers Some of this Powder being cast upon a red hot Iron most of it immediately burnd away with some sparkling and what remaind was of the Colour of Rust of Iron and tasted partly Stiptick and Earthy and part ly Saltish The Water it self being gently evaporated yields a Yellowish Sediment more or less according to the Sea sons Last Spring a Quart yielded six Grains of it but in September following the same Quantity afforded me ninc Grains whereas a Pound of Tunbridge Water gave but one single Grain of Sediment to Mr Boyle as appears by1465 by his Memoirs of Mineral Waters This Sediment being boild in common Water made a strong Lixivium with which Acids causd no sensible Fermentation but Syrup of Violets turnd it Green This Lixivium being evapo rated yielded a fat Sulphurous Salt that would not coa gulate into Crystals I can get but three or four Grains of it out of ten Grains of Sediment but from the Colour and Taste of the Lixivium I have reason to suspect that there is a larger proportion of Saline Particles which as I conceive being Volatile evaporate away with the Wa ter These are some of the most material Experiments I have made upon these Waters As for their Medicinal Virtues I might say a great deal but hoping to enlarge upon it another time I shall only tell you Sir that from the many and truly wonder ful Cures I believe it to be one of the most excellent Waters of this kind as yet found out in England The little Well is very useful in Diseases of the Breast as in Asthmas Coughs Rheums and Catarhs It hath cured several given over of Consumptions of the Lungs Most Disorders of the Stomach are cured by this Water It seldom fails in the Cure of Rheumatick gouty Pains of the Limbs or other Parts of the Body in the Scurvy and Melancholy Distempers Janndice Vapours all sorts of Stoppages Scabs Itch c But in Gravel Cholick and Greensickness tis a true Specifick as also in inward Ulcers if not too far gone A Potter of Bolton who had spent his Substance in Doctors and was last Spring discharged out of St Thomass Hospital as an Incurable Person hath been cured of his Ulcer in the Bladder this Summer with drinking of this Water for three Months together In Agues it is beyond the Bark I have seen some Re bellious ones that could not be removed by the Bark per fectly cured by this Water and some Constitutions quite worn out by the frequent Relapses of this Distemper re 15 F inferredstoredinferred2466 stored again This is also remarkable that it agrees best with old decayd and weak Constitutions The Water sets pleasantly upon the Stomach works off by Urine ve ry briskly causeth a good Appetite chears the Spirits and procures Sleep It is not binding as some other Cha lybeats are but keeps the Body open to most People and upon some it brings now and then a gentle Looseness which carries off the Distemper For these four Years I have prescribd em to many Scores of People every Sea son and I could never observe any inconveniency or ill Symptom arise from the Drinking of em

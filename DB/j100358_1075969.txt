j100358,The School Review,1075969,Editorial Notes,i244545,EDITORIAL NOTES THE problems of secondary education seem to be uppermost in the minds of those who are interested in a nations educational industrial and commercial progress Not many months since we noticed the movement in Germany under the patronage and indeed the inspiration of the Emperor to make the secondary schools conform more nearly to the needs of the national life with its changed and everchanging ideals The bill before the British Parliament at the present time is distinguished from its predecessors by the provision for a more accurate definition of secondary education and for its better articulation with elementary education The Council of the Teachers Guild of England is now making an investigation into the right order and relation of subjectmatter in secondary schools and expects to make this the great subject for discussion at the meeting of the Education Section in con nection with the British Association next autumn But specially interesting to us is the movement in France The Chamber has just concluded a most interesting debate conducted on a very high plane concerning a bill providing for the reformation of certain phases of secondary education in that country The Minister of Public Instruction and the Com mission de lEnseignement after thorough investigation and mature consider ation submitted a plan by which the secondary schools might be made more direct and positive contributors to national progress The movement toward free secondary education is seen in France in the proposal to lower the fees in connection with the lycees and to increase the number of bourses As M Ribot said in the course of the debate As to free secondary education the ideal of a well organized society is not to give the same instruction to all but to open a way to the highest studies for the brighter minds even in the poorest classes of students The total number of hours given to class work and study is to be reduced to nine for pupils under sixteen years of age to seven for those under twelve and a lesson instead of lasting through a weari some two hours is to be confined to one hour These provisions seem to us to be rational and in keeping with modern educational thought But the greatest of changes occur in the heart of the schoolthe plan of studies As an indication of the reason for the changes and of the general tendency in higher education in France an extract from the speech of M Leyques may be cited The struggle among nations for existence is too severe the competition that we have to meet from our rivals is too keen to permit the university to stand aloof In a country like France where the professional population represents 48 per cent of the whole where the commercial capital engaged in agriculture and industry exceeds two 410EDITORIAL NOTES hundred millions of francs the university cannot content itself with preparing the young men entrusted to it for liberal careers alone it must also prepare for active life for action We have already brought our universities into contact with the general life they have come down from the Olympian regions in which they had too long moved They lend their aid to industry commerce and agriculture Who can com plain We have established a school of tanning at the University of Lyons a school of brewing at Nancy laboratories for chemistry as applied to dyeing etc The university has not lost prestige owing to these steps It still cultivates pure science but it cultivates practical science also and it extends its field instead of diminishing it It becomes a force more active and more rich in results In accordance with such an ideal we find the following changes made in the plan of study Secondary education is coordinated with primary in such a way that it forms a sequel to a course of primary instruction having a nor mal duration of four years its own duration is seven years divided into two parts one of four years and one of three In the first division the pupils have a choice between two sections In section A Latin is obligatory from the first year and Greek is optional from the fourth year in section B there is neither Latin nor Greek but emphasis is placed on French science draw ing etc The course of study in this division is so organized as to form a complete whole and is not used as a mere preparation for the next division There will be many pupils whose circumstances will not allow them more than eight years of schooling and the country owes it to these that they be as well equipped as possible for the life in the great outside world In the second division there are four groups of principal courses from which the pupil may make his choice a Latin and Greek b Latin with a more widely developed study of languages c Latin with a more thorough study of science d languages and science without any Latin course There will be only one baccalaureat of secondary education and based on examination on one of the abovementioned sections of the second division All diplomas of bachelier confer the same rights Should students desire not to proceed to the baccalaureat but study applied science they may after passing the examinations at the end of the first division attend for two years certain schools of applied science which the government proposes to develop or found in various parts of the country The striking features of this plan are the possibility of a student obtaining the baccalaurEat and so entering the universities and the professions without any knowledge of Latin shortening of the course and the articulation with primary education the reservation of Greek for the elite Think of France allowing a youth to go through the lycee without Latin or Greek and to go to the university to learn tanning or brewing GEORGE HERBERT LOCKE 411

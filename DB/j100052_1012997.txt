j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1012997,American Export Policies,i242646,AMERICAN EXPORT POLICIES BY FRANKLIN JOHNSTON CoPublisher American Exporter American success in exporting too often depreciated and ig nored has been won largely by manufacturers of highly specialized linesindividual distinctive merchandise or machinery sold under brands I speak advisedly for daily I am in close touch with the export work of over six hundred manufacturers of such lines doing a substantial foreign business many of whom have been doing so for years A recent census of these manufacturers for whom and with whom we are working showed that the average rating is 298000 as listed in one of the mercantile agency books Of these 18 per cent are rated up to and over 1000000 each 50 per cent at less than 100000 and 20 per cent at less than 35000 This is of interest as showing that the small manufacturer of distinctive articles is under no insurmountable difficulties in export trade In South America the three chief export competitors meet on more nearly equal terms than anywhere else in the world There has been a greatly exaggerated idea in this country of the extent to which Germany dominated the markets of South America before the war That she had a very large and important share of that trade cannot be denied but it was no larger than our own and not as large as Great Britains The United States exports more merchandise to Latin America than does any other nation Here in the briefest possible form is the record of Latin American trade in 1913 Exports to Latin America from the United States 325837345 Exports to Latin America from Great Britain and Ireland 322228073 Exports to Latin America from Germany 217967202 The margin over Great Britain is somewhat slight to be sure but over Germany of whose export prowess we hear so much more than of Great Britains it is in round figures 100000000 Our ex ports to the Argentine have grown from less than 10000000 in the year 1902 to over 50000000 in 1913 while those to Brazil grew 51THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY from 10000000 to 42000000 and those to Uruguay from 1500000 to 7500000 Instead of having a negligible share of the trade to those countries as many would have us believe we supply Argentina with 15 per cent of all she buys while Great Britain furnishes her with 30 per cent and Germany supplies 16 per cent Of Great Britains exports to Argentina onefifth is coal alone In the case of Brazil we sell her 15 per cent of her total imports as against 25 per cent from England and 17 per cent from Germany Germanys export trade with Brazil being 4000000 larger than our own Our trade with these countries has grown hand in hand with that of Germany and Great Britain If a chart is drawn showing the growth of the export trade of the three great rivals in either Argentina or Brazil for the past ten or fifteen years the general curve upward of the English lines will be paralleled somewhat below to be sure by the American and German and the German and American lines will touch and even cross each other at times so close has been the rivalry Under normal conditions we have therefore as large an export trade with Argentina and Brazil as Germany and that trade has grown just as fast indeed at times faster than that of either Ger many or Great Britain It must be said however that Germanys trade is more diverse than either Great Britains or our own What then is the reason for the persistent popular impression that our trade with South America is negligible That impression is founded on the fallacy that American ships and foreign branches of American banks are a necessary preliminary to extending American trade American manufacturers are under no handicap as regards shipping and banking in developing their trade with Latin America When American manufacturers find themselves unable to sell abroad the fault usually lies not with the ships and banks but with the goods the costs of production or inefficient selling methods British export trade is won chiefly by quality German by cheapness American by inventive and mechanical genius plus largescale production which makes for moderate prices Each of the three competitors has strong points and each has weak points British quality usually means high cost and when durability is aimed at often means a solidity that is carried to an absurd degree 52AMERICAN EXPORT POLICIES The competing American article is lighter more graceful and cheaper The competing German article is too often an imitation of the British or American sold at a much cheaper price and on terms which an Argentine gentleman spoke of some time ago as insane credits Price is the poorest sales argument and people have almost forgotten that many German lines had far better claims to distinction German export success has been marvelous but it has not been altogether a healthy growth Made in Germany has come to convey the sense of cheap shoddy goods and even of imi tations This has been recognized nowhere more than in Germany In 1913 a German Export Association of High Quality Manufac turers was formed to combat the cheap price reputation of Ger many abroad and its ideal at home Its president said The systems of the English French but principally of the American and Swedish trade have been based from the very start on the prestige and standing of the manufacturer who must always take the responsibility for quality and rea sonable prices of his products Against the strong organizations of foreign manufacturers small industries prevail in Germany which do not strive so much for quality as for cheap prices  German manufacturers apparently know of only one argument and that is low prices But when prices decrease quality also becomes inferior Another serious fault in German export methods has been an unwise overextension of credits The long credits of South America have been greatly exag gerated in American discussions So has the alleged refusal of American manufacturers and merchants to extend credits As aptly phrased by the president of the United States Steel Corpora tion Mr James A Farrell who for many years was at the head of that corporations export subsidiary Wherever there is a substantial basis for credit American manufacturers will not be found lacking in devising means to grant reasonable and proper accom modations It will be invariably found that where extended credits are given the seller charges an increased price and the buyer does not benefit to the extent to which prompt payment entitles him Not only does he pay an increased price either visible or in visible by decreased quality but the whole structure of commerce in any given market is shaken when credits are given unwisely for sooner or later such overextension brings about a smash This occurred in South America notably in Argentina and Brazil and 53THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY those countries which were just recovering from the effects of whole sale liquidation and bankruptcies similar to some of our own finan cial depressions when the war broke out Commercial failures in the Argentine in 1913 were twice as large as in 1912 three times as large as 1911 four times as large as 1910 The opening months of 1914 showed a still greater commercial mortality and the total liabilities for the year were more than double those of 1913 This financial disturbance came as a result of easy credits at a time when land speculation had become almost a mania the bubble being pricked by a series of bad crops American conservatism in granting credits has been justified in part at least by such events and German eagerness to extend unwise credits has proved disastrous alike to her and her debtors To a large extent the financial crisis before the war and the rapid changes brought about by the war have brought a new com mercial generation in the Argentine Old houses have liquidated partners retired old connections been severed new ones formed new houses opened This new generation cannot buy German goods nor even the allotted amount of British or French and will necessarily buy American goods Germanys unwise credits have fallen like a house of cards and in the reconstruction of the commercial struc ture she will have no part for some time to come When Germany again competes for South American business it will be on a far healthier basis with less talk of cheapness and more of quality and with far more conservatism in extending credits Meanwhile the virtues of slightly more expensive competing American goods will be established This change in Germanys export policy was in evitable sooner or later but it has been hastened by the war and the war has enormously intensified the lesson of overextension Mention has been made of the application of the Sherman law to export trade As we know combinations to control output and fix prices in many staple lines sold on a close competitive margin of price and not capable of being exploited along the lines that highly specialized lines are are permitted and even encouraged in Europe Such lines as manufactures for further use in manufacturing and crude materialssteel copper wire nails cement cheap paper cordage etcmight be mentioned It would seem as though our manufacturers in such lines ought not to be forced to act under legal 54AMERICAN EXPORT POLICIES restrictions to which their foreign competitors are not liable pro vided unfair practices were not employed The Clayton Act as originally drawn would have made illegal nearly every customary method of developing export trade These methods are not peculiar to this country but are worldwide Their morality is it seems to me not to be questioned They comprise ordinary agreements under which patented articles may be sold and both maker and dealer or agent protected A vigorous nation wide protest from small manufacturers as well as large ones resulted in export trade being specifically exempted from the provisions of the Clayton Act Recently the federal courts have found for the defendants in a number of actions brought by the government under the Sherman law Among such decisions was that in the case of a number of steamship lines operating to Brazil Freight is a commodity no less than steel rails or copper To allow steamship owners to com bine to fix freight rates on steel products and to forbid steel products manufacturers to combine to fix prices on their products is on the face of it absurd and unjust Its absurdity is hardly diminished by the fact that most of the steamship lines are owned abroad so that American manufacturers trusts or independents are encour aged to practice cutthroat competition while the steamship lines maintain profitable freights and share the benefits with foreign buyers and foreign manufacturers who are allowed to take joint action as they see fit Disappointment has been expressed because small manufac turers show such a lack of interest in the arguments urging the bene fits of combination for export trade This may be attributed to the fact that small manufacturers of highly specialized lines of articles sold under brands or trade marks such as engines machinery typewriters shoes sewing machines haberdashery automobiles bicycles and scores of other lines have never felt the need of such combinations for themselves although they may be in favor of them in principle In short the small manufacturer may recognize the force of the arguments but the subject has an academic interest chiefly He has succeeded in export business by individual effort The difficulties of forming a co6perative export organization in certain lines would be almost insurmountable with no guarantee that the results would be satisfactory A poorly managed combina 55THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY tion would break down under its own weight as many trusts department stores and chainstore organizations have while their more efficient though smaller rivals have prospered Hence it may be doubted whether express governmental permission to com bine for export trade would meet with any immediately marked response from small manufacturers of specialized lines This is not to deny that the instinct of avoiding ruinous competition is not growing in strength Inadvertently much of the discussion on this topic has given an entirely erroneous impression as to the difficulties small manufacturers have to contend with in establishing an export business It will be found that ample facilities for export distribu tion are available for the manufacturer of specialized lines For such lines large initial expense to develop foreign trade is rarely necessary or even advisable Elaborate foreign selling organiza tions for the average manufacturer would not only be unnecessary generally speaking but positively detrimental because the impor tant distributing factors would be antagonized at the start and would be in a well intrenched position to retaliate In England Germany and the United States there are numerous facilities to help manufacturers in their export distribution where the manufacturers are not in a position to doas of course they very rarely are in a position to doall the distributing Large importers act as local distributors The average manufacturer receives more or less of his export orders from the importers not direct but through the export commission houses although he works up the business direct by some form of solicitation Even when a manufacturer employs one or more foreign travelers many of the orders are passed through the hands of the export com mission houses and paid for by them and in some cases manufac turers insist on all orders being so handled Where export orders are paid for by the export commission merchant for the account of foreign importers it becomes as nearly cash business as the American manufacturer can secure at home or abroad Although the tendency to do a direct business is constantly increasingand in some markets such as certain European ones is the rule rather than the exceptionvery many importers as well as manufacturers prefer this method of business and probably always will The proportion of export business passed through these houses 56AMERICAN EXPORT POLICIES as brokers so to speak depends on the character of goods character and location of market and various other circumstances No set rule can be made to apply In London there are 1596 export mer chants in Hamburg 1189 while in New York there are 605 export commission merchants 180 buying offices for foreign merchants or industrial concerns and 128 manufacturers export agents or mana gers Export agents perform many of the functions of the commis sion houses but are paid by the manufacturer instead of by the foreign merchant In recent years there has been a marked ten dency for the commission houses to take up special agencies It will be seen therefore that in all three countries the export merchant is a distinct factor and that he is no less in evidence in England and Germany than here Yet the very existence of the export commis sion houses is all but ignored by the American government officials in discussing foreign trade and this has caused a good deal of mis understanding The establishment of branch offices or warehouses abroad on the part of manufacturers is the exception not the rule in export trade A theory that manufacturers must open branch houses in all the worlds markets in order to do business would lead even the more than average sized manufacturer to bankruptcy American export trade in manufactured goods is shared by thousands of manufacturers big as well as little little as well as big and of those thousands it is doubtful whether more than twenty have their own local branches carrying stocks in Buenos Aires for instance With rare exceptions the manufacturer British German and American whatever his size finds it more economical and more profitable to let others perform some of the functions necessary to get the goods from factory to foreign consumer No manufacturing corporation however large has its own sales organization in all markets although two or three come very close to it including one American oil com pany and one American sewing machine company In Buenos Aires for instance there are just fortyfour American business houses other than industrial plants These fortyfour comprise all the American dealers the American importers and ex porters as well as the local branch offices of American manufac turers There are one hundred and sixtythree British business houses in Buenos Aires and two hundred and ninetynine German and in view of the large number of merchant importers of those 57THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY nationalities domiciled in Buenos Aires it is evident that few manufacturers of those countries can have branches in Buenos Aires or the total number of business houses credited to them would be very much larger This may be better appreciated when it is realized that there are 29690 business houses in Buenos Aires exclusive of industrial or manufacturing plants and of this number which included the retail establishments 12383 are Italian 7822 Spanish and 4358 Argentine These figures are from a recent in dustrial census taken of Buenos Aires as reported in Commerce Reports published by the Department of Commerce The number of American manufacturers having their own salaried exclusive representatives permanently in Buenos Aires carrying no stock and selling to larger houses wholesalers chiefly is only a trifle larger than those having their own branches It is impossible to fix the exact number but a liberal estimate would be seventyfive The number of British or German exclusive repre sentatives may be estimated as proportionately the same If Argentina has so few branch establishments and exclusive repre sentatives what must be the case in smaller markets such as Chile Peru the Amazon district of Brazil or even Rio de Janeiro There are not a dozen American British or German manufacturers who maintain their own branches with stocks in all Brazil and less in Chile or Peru Moreover while in certain trades one or two manu facturers have their own foreign branches their competitors also do a large export business For instance one American typewriter company has its own retail branch in Buenos Aires Other Ameri can typewriters are equally as wellknown in the Argentine market although their distribution is done by local dealers A famous sewing machine company has its own retail branches not only in Buenos Aires but seemingly in every town of even slight importance throughout Latin America Yet other American sewing machine companies do a large business in the same markets Cooperative foreign selling agencies in noncompeting lines are by no means a new thing in export although comparatively rare Five large hardware manufacturers in Philadelphia have such an organization Some twenty manufacturers of printers supplies paper etc have one That particular line is one which seemingly offers an especially good field for such a plan There can be of course no legal objections to such export combinations as that 58AMERICAN EXPORT POLICIES 59 Nor can there be any economic objection for in theory such organizations are sound But in practice the difficulties of securing the right personnel overcoming the opposition of local importers and satisfying all the constituent manufacturers some of whom are bound to feel that their share of the sales is less than their share of the expense are so great as to make its general success not perhaps impossible but certainly difficult On the other hand there are numerous business houses all over the world which perform practically all the functions which such an organization could at a minimum of cost and risk to the manufacturers These houses are firmly established and their experience personnel capital and intimate knowledge of local con ditions make them by far the best channel in most cases for local distribution of merchandise The Clayton Act as has been pointed out exempts from its provisions arrangements between manufac turers and agents or dealers as regards export trade and that exemp tion was wisely made

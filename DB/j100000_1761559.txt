economists engaged in carrying on the science of political economy by a consistent development of its older results according to such new light as can be brought MAP OF PARIS SHOWING TIE DISTRIBUTION OF TELEPHONES La naitre Sentier districts the subscribers are most abundant There are a dozen district offices so distributed as to insure the service with the minimum of conductors the system being as is known almost entirely subter ranean Between each of these twelve offices and the eleven others there are auxiliary lines sufficient to establish communications between the subscrib ers by passing through two district offices at the most whatever be the distance between the subscrib ers The number of these auxiliary lines naturally varies with that of the subscribers connected with each district office to bear upon them   A host of writers have been busy for the last twentyyears introducing conflicting and baseless notions which for want of a competent criticism have won standing in the science Others have made a boast of turning their backs on scien tific method and of describing by way of con tributing to political economy some portion of the surface appearance which is presented by Collected essays in political and social science By WIL LIAn GRAHAM SUMNER New York Ifolt 1885112 SCI1 the mass of economic phenomena in their se quence variety and complexity That is as if a historian should boast of abandoning the attempt to trace social forces in history and of returning to the description of royal mar riages and diplomatic intrigues Professor Sumner thus describes in the opening sentences of the second essay in the volume before us the present condition of economic science That such a description should be in the main a true one is deplorable and Professor Sumner is deserving of all com mendation for his stanch loyalty to welles tablished economic doctrines and to the cause of scientific method as against empiricism in economic research But if the world has been going astray in recent years we do not be lieve it has been solely because we are a stiff necked generation Much has doubtless been due to the sins of the time but much too can be traced to the shortcomings of tliose who maintain the true doctrine Probably nothing has done more to discredit the author ity of economists of the English school than the widespread opinion that they decide every question of political economy however compli cated by an offhand application of a few sim ple principles And it does indeed belong to the intrinsic character of their investigations that a few leading principles are kept con stantly in view and that questions which would otherwise be involved in hopeless confusion are thus made amenable to orderly and sys tematic and frequently successful treatment Too many writers not without standing and authority not without learning and penetra tion have however gone farther and fallen into the way of cutting the knot of every intri cate problem by a single sharp and decisive blow of the sword  by an appeal to the magi cal force of a great economic law Thley have thus given the objectors to the science of Ri cardo and ill a real and important ground for their criticism Unfortunately Professor Sumner too often places himself in the ranks of the writers we have just been describing In the volume be fore us there are three economic essays  on bimetallism on wages and on the argument against protective taxes In the first and third there is before the writer a distinct fallacy to refute a distinct outrage upon economic doc trine to resent and it is in such a situation that there is the strongest tendency to crush an op ponent by a single blow to sweep away all argument by a single appeal to an allcompre hending principle Accordingly we find that Professor Sumners argument against the pos NCE VOL VI No 131 sibility of a concurrent circulation of gold and silver may be summed up in the mere dictitm that since supply and demand regulate value all the governments in the world could not make silver and gold circulate together and his argument against the belief that protective taxes may in some cases contribute to the gen eral prosperity is little more than the bald statement that restraints upon commerce intro duce no new productive power and hence can not increase the aggregate production while as every tax and every restraint involves waste and loss there is sure to be a diminution in the aggregate production and a fall in the general prosperity Considerations such as these are very good as far as they go and are indeed of the highest importance They give a primafacie reason for believing that those who expect economic advantage to arise from protection or who think it possible to make gold and silver circulate side by side as prime mediums of exchange are mistaken One may say more it needs but a brief and clear exposition of general princi ples to take the ground from under the feet of all the ordinary advocates on the stump or in the newspapers of protective taxes or bi metallic currency or rather to show that such advocates ignorant of the first principles of political economy and heedless of the simplest requirements of sound reasoning had no ground to stand upon But there are men who know something about political economy and still think that an agreement of all the commercial nations of the world could keep silver circulat ing alongside of gold at a constant ratio they haveJ hard of supply and demand and have some understanding of its working they know aL well as Professor Sumner does that con gress cannot that all the governments of tlhe earth cannot enforce a fiat that a pound of meat shall have the same value as a pound of sugar they know also however tha the de nmand for the precious metals comes in a very gieat measure from their use as coins and that their use as coins is in a great measure affected by the more or less arbitrary action of governments It behooves an economist under these circumstances to point out if lie can that the influence of governmental action upon the demand for gold and silver has such bounds that variations in the supply might oc curor must occur sufficient to overbalance that influence Professor Sumner contents himself with repeating in every variety of ex pression the assertion that government cannot confer upon any thing a higher value than that which is determined by demand and supply 1SCIENCE  Congress cannot regulate the value of money until it can make a man give for a gold dollar one grain of wheat more than supply and de mand force him to give or yield a gold dollar for one grain less than supply and demand will give him for it  It cannot regulate the value of a coin any more than it can regulate a physical object to make it longer or shorter than it is    To secure a concurrent cir culation then at a fixed ratio it is necessary to suppress the effects which can only be done by suppressing the forces so that a concurrent circulation could never be realized until we could extinguish economic forces by human agency Now all this might be well enough by way of reply to one who was ignorant of the existence of  economic forces and the rest but of what avail is it as against a man whose mind is troubled by the fact that gov ernmental action is itself in the matter of cur rency one of the most constant and apparently important of these  economic forces  In telligent doubters and honest opponents can be but little influenced by the levelling of economic anathemas at them they can only be won over by a fair statement of the strongest argu ments that can be urged on the other side and a refutation of them Similar objections apply with equal force to Professor Sumners treatment of the subject of protection It is of immense advantage to correct thinking on the subject that one should see first of all clearly and unmistakably that a protective tariff is a tax on production that its immediate effect is to diminish production to reduce the returns to labor and capital to lessen the rewards of human effort Th dem onstration of this important though simple truth at once clears the air of the mists and vapors with which it may have been filled by popular ignorance and misconception But when it is urged by clear and candid thinkers that there may be cases in which even upon purely eco nomic grounds it may be worth while to incur this loss for the sake of a future gain made possible by it it is useless to dogmatically shut off discussion by simply saying that pro tection is an economic loss and nothing but economic loss can come of it There is not the least disregard of the principles of political economy in supposing that an industry which it would not pay to introduce in a given coun try without government protection might be a profitable and independent one after it was introduced Lack of knowledge national hab its the prestige of foreign manufacturers such are some of the causes which may pre vent the rise in a given country of an industry 113 for the pursuit of which its natural advantages may be exceptionally great and it is simply impossible to  demonstrate that an indus try may not thus be established a century sooner than it would otherwise be and which in all but its first years would be a source of increased prosperity to all classes of the peo ple There are a thousand valid objections to protection even in this case but it is not an economic absurdity To say as Professor Sumner does that it is mathematically im possible that it a protective tariff should ever issue in an independent and productive industry is to vastly diminish in the mind of an intelligeilt reader the force of those con clusions whose truth has really been demon strated Ungracious as it may seem we have yet to draw attention to a special feature in the style and method of Professor Sumners argument which is calculated to intensify the impres sion of dogmatism and reckless generaliza tion which economic writing of this character so often produces This is his constant em ployment of language borrowed from mechanics or physics and especially his frequent ap peals to the principle of the conservation of energy Amateurs in natural science have shown in the last decade or two a very great fondness for this principle and have delighted in exhibiting the facility with which by its aid they could solve the problem of the universe or any smaller problem which might happen to engage their attention But responsible writ ers on political economy  or for that matter on any other subject  will do well to leave the principle of the conservation of energy to play its proper part in its proper field Some writers might be surprised to find how neces sary it is even in that field to use it in the exact sense in which it is understood by mathe matical physicists how little it enables one to do easy offhand work and accomplish the im mediate despatch of all scientific business One regrets to see even so much as the term used in discussions that are outside the domain of physics for fear that the vagueness which must necessarily there attach to the term may affect the reasoning in which it appears this however may in some sense be regarded as a matter of taste But to use the principle of the conservation of energy by way of argument in economic discussion is utterly unjustifiable and when a writer says that i to suppose the contrary of an economic proposition  is to deny the most obvious application of the con servation of energy to economic forces he can but make the judicious grieve The acme AUGUST 7 18851114 SCIENCE however of this kind of writing and thinking is reached by Professor Sumner when in one of the noneconomical articles p 134 he gravely tells us speaking of elections that  they are not a source of energy and there fore cannot cause any thing at all We have dwelt thus at length upon these faults because we consider them as most hurt ful to the cause of sound discussion and to the influence of the very methods in political economy which with Professor Sumner we wish to see upheld We have not attempted to give a full account or if one prefers the ex pression a fair account of the papers collected in this volume In the article on wages and even in those on bimetallism and on protection there are instructive passages and telling points The articles are not made up entirely of impatient assertion and sweeping denuncia tion In the discussion of bimetallism valid practical reasons are adduced against it and the same is true with regard to protection but it is precisely the theoretical core of the argu ment which is made weak and powerless by the defects which we have endeavored to point out SCIENTIFIC CULTURE THE question of the position of the physical sciences in courses of instruction as compared to that of the classics was scarcely thought of at the time when Professor Cooke began his work as an instructor in the experimental sciences thirty years ago During this long service as a teacher and investigator the ques tion became a glowing one but has been so far settled as to give to many of the essays of the little volume before us an historical rather than a current interest Nevertheless the general reader who may care nothing for the Greek question will read these essays with pleasure He will admire the earnestness and candor of the writer He will follow with delight the limpid stream of argument and exposition To the citation drawn from the literature of physics to the effect that  such men as Davy Dalton and Faraday were as truly learned as highly cultivated and as capable of expressing their thoughts in appropriate language as the most eminent of their literary compeers might be added the name of the author The most important statements which are made in these essays are quite independent of the

service than the life of a true teacher but the mere taskmaster has no right to the teachers name and can never attain the teachers reward  p 85  The teaching which a professorship implies instead of being a hindrance ought to be a great stimulus to scientific investigation Of course this influence is greatly impaired if as in many of our colleges the available energies of the teacher are exhausted by the daily routine of instruction or by outside work re quired to supplement his meagre salary but if the teaching is only moderate in amount and in the direction of the professors own work there is no stimulus so great as that which the association with a class of earnest students supplies  p 280 Men of affairs should resign the endow ments intended for the maintenance of scholars

the past few years in colonial and com mercial enterprises has produced some good results and has given occasion for a few good books notably those of Schweinfurth and Nachtigal Dr Joest instead of following those explorers into equatorial Africa circum navigated the Dark Continent visiting only a few inland towns in the extreme southeast He described his travels in a series of let ters to the Cologne Zeitung which form the basis of the present work Schweinfurth and Nachtigal performed their tasks well and gave us good commonsense accounts of the people they visited and the countries they saw So has Dr Joest His first stoppingplaces were Madeira and St Helena which have been so often described that he was able to add little of interest From St Helena he went to Cape town or Kapstadt as he in true German fash ion insists upon calling it And this is a good place to utter a protest against the habit which the Germans have of translating proper names for really  Kapstadt  Tafelbai and

transaction inter vivos presents clear evidence of an intention to make a gift or to release a debtor the English courts in general have held that the appointment of the intended donee or debtor as executor perfects the gift or release The vesting of the legal title to the estate in the executor is considered to supply the necessary legal formalities and to complete the transaction But to deal adequately with the problem it is necessary to examine more closely the principles upon which this result may be reached in each of the two types of cases The testators will at his death gives the legal title of all his personal property to his executor in trust for the fulfilling of certain duties Under the early law the executor was presumed to take an absolute property in the residue2 Later it was provided by statute in England that it should be conclusively presumed that the executor take no beneficial interest but hold any residue in trust for the next of kin or residuary legatee and this presumption could be rebutted only by evidence on the face of the will3 It is submitted that under such a statute the effect of making the intended donee executor would not be to complete the gift since a contrary intent is implied into the will by what is in effect a statutory rule of construction4 In America a similar result would probably be reached even in the absence of a specific statute by a con struction of the will itself5 1 Strong v Bird L R i8 Eq 315 release In re Applebee i891 3 Ch 422 re lease In re Griffen i899 i Ch 408 release In re Stewart i908 2 Ch 251 gift of bonds

to have arisen in America but either by express statute by construction of the Statute of Distribution or by decision the executor in most states must hold any residue in trust for the next of kin and parol evidence would probably not be admitted to effect a different result Paup v Mingo 4 Leigh Va i63 Hays v Jackson 6 Mass 148 152 Nickerson v Bowly 49 Mass 424 431 Hill v Hill 2 Hayw S C 298 Dunlap v Ingram 4 Jones Eq S C I78 Broome v Alston 8 Fla 307 Chamberlins Appeal446 HARVARD LA W REVIEW The question of the incomplete release is however different Under the English law the appointment of a debtor as executor completely destroys the debt6 This is based on the theory that as an executor can not sue himself the legal liability is cut off and a voluntary destruction of the liability destroys the whole chose in action But equity considered that it was inequitable for the debtor to be excused from liability by what might be termed a legal accident Therefore to carry out the probable intention of the testator which the law could not do it forced the executor to hold an amount of his own property equal to the debt in trust for the next of kin Two questions then arise i Will the fact that the testator would have desired the debt to be released prevent the raising of this equitable liability 2 Does any rule of law exclude evi dence of this fact In cases of resulting trusts where evidence of a contrary intention can be admitted the rise of the equitable duty or liability will be pre vented8 Again where the legal liability of a debtor is released by the destruction of a specialty an equitable liability will arise unless it appears that the act was accompanied by an intent to release the debtor Since equity in the facts under discussion raises a trust as an aid to the law only for the purpose of carrying out what probably would have been the intention of the testator it does not seem illogical from these analogies that equity should refuse to raise a trust if it can be shown that the testator would have intended otherwise9 It is clear that no actual intent appears on the face of the will from the mere appointment of an executor that he hold a part of his own property in trust for the next of kin10 Nor is there any statutory rule of construction which implies this inten tion from the appointment It is clear also that the admission of evidence of this intention does not give effect to a parol testamentary disposition The asset to which it indirectly relates has been destroyed as the legal result of the debtors 70 Conn 363 39 Atl 734 Linnott v

attempt to release the debt before death is not much evidence that the testator intended the will to operate as a release yet it is evidence that he would not have intended the debtor to pay his debt to the next of kin 10 It is true that the use of certain words is considered to imply the intent to accom plish a particular legal effect And in England by rules of construction parol evidence to prove that some other effect was intended is not always admissible For instance it cannot be shown that an express trustee was intended to take beneficially Croome v Croomd 59 L T R 582 And the same reasoning is likely in America to exclude evidence that property passed directly to an executor by his appointment is not in tended to be held in trust On the other hand when A pays B for a conveyance from B to C a resulting trust arises for A but may be rebutted by evidence of a contrary intent Jackson v Feller 2 Wend N Y 465 In the facts under discussion the equitable liability is not attached to any property passed by the will but to the execu tors own estate It is difficult to imply merely from the words appointing an executor any actual intention that this new debt shall arise in equityNOTES 447 becoming executor This evidence then merely proves circumstances which may or may not impose an equitable liability on the executors estate and would therefore seem admissible The decision in a recent English case that the appointment of the debtor as executor after an ineffective release inter vivos extinguishes the debt seems therefore sound In re Pink I9I2 2 Ch 52811 11 Strong v Bird supra In re Applebee supra In re Griffen supra Contra In re Hyslop supra By statute and decision in many American jurisdictions the debt is not extinguished at law by the appointment of the debtor as executor It would still be a legal asset therefore and parol evidence could not be brought in to affect its disposition See WOERNER AMERICAN LAW OF ADMINISTRATION  3II 2 WIL LIAMS

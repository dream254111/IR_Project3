no such law nor even any such custom in this country But so great an advantage has an American publisher over his competitors when by previous arrangement he is enabled to bring out an American edition of an English book simultaneously with its appearance abroad that he rarely hesitates to take the risk and he pays the English author or his representa tive well for this advantage of simultaneous pub lication Now what the Englishman is doing for us under cover of a strong custom and so far un disputed law let us do for him under sanction of a statute and the problem is so far solved that we may safely leave all petty details to be adjusted by the laws of trade between the two countries and the interests of the parties chiefly concerned Si multaneous publication then in the two countries is the fairest way out of our difficulties It is so far compulsory that it makes the best foreign thought as immediately available in America as in Europe It compels the publisher and author not to suit their own convenience but to study the demands of two continents and  the progress of science will receive by such a course an impetus which no method planned for the advantage of the author alone or the publisher alone or the people alone can possibly give H E SCUDDER INTERNATIONAL COPYRIGHT THE question of copyright like most questions of civil prudence is neither black nor white but gray So said Mr Macaulay Mr Lowell says it is a question of robbery the American copyright league a question of piracy Those who use these epithets base their assertions upon the ground that an author has a broader more extensive right of property in his publications than in other property That a man has property in the production of his brain which ought to be protected is admitted but tne extent of that protection must depend upon the public interest Scruton in his book entitled  Laws of literary property published in 1883 in London says  Utilitarianism is the groundwork of the science and art of legislation and therefore the reason which justifies the enactment of any particular law is the ultimate benefit to result to the commu nity from its conformity to such a law This claim of property in books as made by Mr Lowell and the league is of modern origin and was not made until the early part of the last century long after the introduction of printing and is not recog WCE 135 nized by any civilized governlent Grants in the nature of copyright were first made to printers to encourage the multiplication of books and were subsequently made for the benefit of the authors In England the courts have decided that at com mon law an author had no right of property in his publications and that whatever rights he has have been created by statute law Our constitution provides that congress shall have power to promote science and the useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their re spective writings and discoveries The powers of congress are more limited than those of the par liament of Great Britain which are not restricted by any constitution and many grants which in England have been made for the benefit of authors would in this country have been uncon stitutional Every copyright is a monopoly This proposition has been admitted by some of our authors but denied by others who were probably ignorant of the meaning of the word A monopoly is an exclusive trading privilege  it is the sole right or power of selling something the full com mand over the sale of any thing a grant from the sovereign to some one individual of the sole right of making and selling some one commodity Every monopoly must be construed strictly and should not be extended where reasonable doubt exists against the right If authors limited their claims of property in the productions of their brains to the manuscript or a printed copy no one would dispute their right to hold or lease or sell it but they claim much more the monopoly of publication and selling the exclusive right of multiplying copies everywhere and in every tongue and for all time and they appeal to the government for aid in enforcing this right Every nation has repudi ated this claim as contrary to the interests of the public and granted only such limited rights as it judged expedient General Hawley who introduced the bill favored by the league which gave the foreign author per mission to publish abroad or in this country realizing the weight of the objections made by the publisher and printer that it would result in transferring the printing of all international copy righted books to foreign countries proposed an amendment to his bill providing that every foreign book copyrighted in this country should be printed and published here If the view of the league is correct this amendment robs the foreign author of a part of his property by depriving him of the privilege of selecting the time or place of publication or choosing his publisher The tendency of this amendment would be to increase the cost of copyrighted books136 SCIENCE as the foreign edition if made large enough to sup ply both countries could be sold much cheaper here than a new edition printed in this country It is asserted that this difficulty would be obviated by the tariff laws as there is a duty of twentyfive per cent on books but this is offset by duties on paper type ink and other materials that enter into the composition of a book and also by cheaper foreign labor There is apparently a widespread desire for an international copyright but so far as my obser vation extends this wish is confined to English and American authors or solely to parties who have a direct interest in the matter England favors it because she will receive much greater benefit from our international copyright than America from an English international act as ten English books are sold here for every American book sold there A careful consideration of the whole subject will show that each country favors such legislation as is most conducive to its interest and that the judgment of every author and publisher upon this subject is influenced even if insensibly to himself by the same motive These authors and pub lishers are interested witnesses and I believe there is not a single disinterested witness among those who have appeared before congress favor ing this measure This interest does not affect all authors alike for some write because they cannot help writing some for the purpose of benefiting the public others for fame while only a few write simply for money Many of our old authors wrote before any copyright existed and some of our best living au thors would have written if we had no such laws But authors cannot live on fame and like other workers should be fully and amply compensated The copyright is of much less direct value either to the public or authors than is generally sup posed It is only the best authors who would suffer if we had no copyright Mr Holt one of our largest publishers states that out of every five publications one is a failure three barely pay the cost of publication while the fifth be sides paying its cost defrays the general expenses of the business belonging to the five books and a profit to the publisher and author The indirect benefit is much greater for the successful book is generally known to all and in cites authors to write and booksellers to publish Special and scientific books often have few readers and yet are of greater public benefit than more popular works These are published in the expec tation that the slow and steady sale during the life of the monopoly will pay the cost and yield some profit and some fame to the author How far this monopoly should be extended and whether VOL VII No 158 foreigners should enjoy it are questions of expe diency and not of right Wherever such exten sions will promote science and the arts they should be granted The direct benefits of international copyright are much less than those from our own copyright laws while the direct injury will be very great as is shown by the arguments in its favor The reasons assigned by the league at the hearing before the senate committee for an international act are  First that it would increase the price of foreign books and stay the flood of cheap literature that now deluges the land second that it would increase the demand for American works raise their price and thereby benefit the American author The opinions varied in regard to the increase in the price of foreign books that would be caused by an international copyright though all agreed that the publication of cheap editions of new books would be discontinued I requested a book seller of New York to prepare a list of a consider able number of choice English books exclusive of special and scientific books and works of fiction with the prices of the foreign edition in London and New York and of the reprint in this country The aggregate price of 42 books in London was 339 of the same editions in New York 54580 of the reprint 14090 The average cost per copy was 807 in London 1290 same edition in New York 335 for the reprint Many of these books have been reprinted in cheap editions at from ten to twenty cents per volume If the act proposed by the league were passed and the books published in London and sent here for sale the prices would be regulated by the prices in London for if it were considerably lower here the books would be sent back to England for sale If published here either by a London or Ameri can house the price would not much exceed the price of American books of the same class Mr J R Lowell on the second day of the hear ing gave it as his opinion that the price of Ameri can books would not be raised as the increased demand when the cheap reprints were stopped would yield sufficient profit to the publisher at the old price Mr Holt a publisher of New York and Mr Estes a bookseller of Boston agreed that the cheap reprints had reduced the demand for American books so largely that the inducement to write was insufficient In answer to these statements it was shown that notwithstanding the great depression in all kinds of business for two or three years the num ber of copyrighted books had increased from 8000 in 1876 to 10000 in 1885 or twentyfive per centFEBRUARY 12 1886 SCIE in nine years showing the same ratio of increase with our population and that the books copy righted in America exceed those copyrighted in Great Britain These figures prove conclusively that the cheap foreign literature has increased the demand for American books by enlarging the circle of read ers and cultivating a taste for reading that an international copyright must as all its advocates admit increase the price of foreign books cut off the supply of cheap literature and thereby check the growing desire for reading that it would therefore be a tax on knowledge and would neither be for the interests of the people nor of the American authors and will not promote science and the useful arts GARDINER G HUBBARD A NEW ROUTE TO SOUTHWESTERN CHINA MB HOLT S HALLETTS studies and explorations have revolutionized our ideas with regard to the geography of IndoChina It was only six years ago that Archibald Ross Colquhoun was an un known engineer in the public works department of British Burmah He became interested in the geography of IndoChina and accompanied an expedition sent by the Indian government to Zimme in northern Siam The information gathered on that journey is embodied in his  Amongst the Shans This trip only whetted his appetite for adventure and in the winter of 188182 he crossed southern China from Canton to Man dalay His intention had been to connect this ex ploration with that made on the Zimme expedition The local Chinese officials however placed so many obstacles in his path that when almost within sight of the boundary separating the Shan states from Yunnan he was obliged to turn back and to make the best of his way to Mandalay by the comparatively wellknown route via Talifu and Bamo As he was about to lead another expedition to the Shan country he was sent by the London Times as a war correspondent to Tonquin Unable to carry out his explorations in person he found a worthy coadjutor in Mr Hallett a practised surveyor who had been for years in charge of some of the most important divisions of British Burmah The object these two men had in view was the finding of a practicable railwayroute connecting India and some British seaport with the fertile portions of southwestern China IndoChina  as the southeastern section of Asia lying to the south of China proper is now conveniently termed  is divided into three great natural divisions the western drained by the NVCE 137 Irawaddy Sittang and Salwen into the Bay of Bengal the central by the MehKong or Cambo dia River and by the MehNam a river of Bang kok into the Gulf of Siam and the eastern by the Sontai or Red River of Tonquin into the Gulf of Tonquin The valley of the Irawaddy is sep arated from that of the Salwen by a vast moun tainchain while the eastern and central divisions are separated by a range or backbone running from the Tibetan plateau to the Malay peninsula The lowest level of this latter range is in the lati tude of Maulmain a British seaport situated on the estuary of the Salwen Now as the most fertile portion of Yunnan is in the central divis ion obviously the best route for reaching it lies in crossing this great mountainrange in the lati tude of Maulmain This was the first conclusion at which the explorers arrived It is true that the line via Bamo and Talifu had hitherto been the favorite route But as Mr Hallett points out although the distance between those two towns in a direct line is only two hun dred and fifty miles the shortest practicable route for a railway would be very nearly six hundred miles in length and even then four passes be tween eight thousand and nine thousand feet above sealevel would have to be crossed Mr Halletts plan consists then in a railway running from Bangkok the capital of Siam up the MehNam to its junction with the MehPing thence up the MehPing by Raheng where the line from Maulmain would coime in to a point near the confluence of the MehPing and the Meh Wung then up the latter river and across the waterparting between the MehNam system and the MehKong or Cambodia River to the Meh Kong at KiangHsen a town near the boundary between the Siamese and Burmese Shan states thence over the plain bordering the MehKong to KiangHung a town within fifty miles of Ssumao a Chinese frontier town where Colquhoun was turned back The southern portion of this route was well known owing in a great measure to the efforts of the American missionaries in Siam Mr Halletts task therefore was to connect their explorations with those of Colquhoun He carried to his work the skill of a practical engineer and his surveys were made with such splendid precision that the cartographer of the Geographical society was able to construct an excellent map of northern Siam which is reproduced in this number of Science Of course there are several objections to this proposed route It can be only indirectly con 1  Exploration survey for a railway connection between India Siam and China Proc roy geogr

J100587,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16831775,104634,SOME ACCOUNTS OF THE FOETUS IN UTERO BEING DIFFERENTLY AFFECTED BY THE SMALL POX BY W WATSON F R S,I206911,235 IX SOME ACCOUNTS OF THE FAETUS IN UTERO BEING DIFFERENTLY AFFECTED BY THE SMALL POX BY W WATSON F R S T H A T THE HUMAN SPECIES SHOULD ONLY ONCE IN THEIR LIVES BE LIABLE TO THE SMALL POX HAS LONG BEEN OBSERVED WITH SUR PRIZE BOTH BY PHYSICIANS AND PHILOSOPHERS NOR IS IT LESS EXTRAORDINARY THAT THE CHILD BEFORE BIRTH WHICH IN EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE IS EQUALLY SUPPORTED BY ITS RECEIVING AND CIRCULATING ITS MOTHERS FLUIDS SHOULD BE SO DIFFERENTLY AFFECTED BY THAT DISTEMPER FROM THE DISSECTIONS OF THOSE WHO HAVE DIED OF THE SMALL POX WE FIND THAT THE VISCERA ARE SUBJECT TO THE VARIOLOUS ABSCESSES AS WELL AS THE SKIN BUT THAT THE FAETUS DOES NOT ALWAYS PARTAKE OF THE IN FECTION FROM ITS MOTHER OR THE MOTHER FROM THE FAETUS IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS PAPER READ DEC 7 1749 ABOUT FOUR YEARS SINCE I ATTENDED A YOUNG MAN A SERVANT TO A CARPENTER WHO HAD A VERY PUTRID AND OFFENSIVE KIND OF SMALL POX OF WHICH NEVERTHELESS HE RECOVERED HIS MISTRESS DURING HIS ILLNESS CAME FREQUENTLY INTO HIS ROOM AND SOMETIMES CONTINUED THERE A CONSIDERABLE TIME SHE WAS THEN ABOUT SEVEN MONTHS GONE WITH CHILD BUT HAD HAD THE SMALL POX HERSELF MANY YEARS BEFORE AT THE USUAL TIME SHE WAS DELIVERED OF A GIRL WHOM I SAW VERY SOON AFTER ITS BIRTH AND THERE APPEARED VERY PLAIN LY THE MARKS OF ABOUT FORTY PUSTULES IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF HER BODY FROM THIS APPEARANCE I THEN IN FORMD THE PARENTS THAT I APPREHENDED THE CHILD G G 2 WOULD236 WOULD HEREAFTER BE VERY SECURE FROM THE INFECTION BUT AS ABOUT A MONTH AGO THE PARENTS THOUGHT PRO PER TO HAVE A LITTLE BOY OF THEIRS INOCULATED I RE QUESTED THAT THEY WOULD PERMIT THE BEFOREMENTIONED GIRL TO BE INOCULATED LIKEWISE AS I DESIRED THEY WERE BOTH INOCULATED FROM A CHILD OF MY OWN WHO HAD FROM INOCULATION HAD A FAVOURABLE KIND UPON THE TENTH DAY AFTER THE OPERATION THE BOY SICKENED AND HAD THE SMALL POX VERY FAVOURABLY ABOUT THE SAME TIME THE GIRL GREW PALE AND LOST HER APPETITE THIS INDISPOSITION CONTINUED FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS AND THEN SHE RECOVERED IN BOTH THESE CHILDREN THE INCISIONS WHICH WERE MADE ONLY IN ONE OF THEIR ARMS WERE EXTREMELY SUPERFICIAL AND INFLAMED IN BOTH AS USUAL THAT IN THE BOY PRODUCED THE VARIOLOUS FEVER AND ITS ATTEN DANTS AS IS BEFOREMENTIONED BUT IN THE GIRL OCCA SIONED ONLY A PALENESS AND LOSS OF APPETITE WITHOUT A FEVER AND ONE VARIOLOUS ABSCESS IN ONE PART OF THE INCISION SUCH AS IS SOMETIMES SEEN IN NURSES AND IN THOSE WHO HAVE ATTENDED PERSONS IN THE SMALL POX WHO HAVE HAD IT THEMSELVES BEFORE THIS ONE  WAS A SUFFICIENT ARGUMENT OF THE VARIOLOUS MATTER TAKING PLACE AND ENDEAVOURING TO EXCITE THE USUAL SYMPTOMS DR MEAD IN HIS LEARNED TREATISE CONCERNING THE SMALL POX TAKES NOTICE OF A WOMANS ATTENDING HER HUSBAND WHO A SHORT TIME BEFORE SHE EXPECTED HER DELIVERY WAS ILL OF THE SMALL POX AS SHE HAD UNDERGONE THE DISTEMPER HERSELF A CONSIDERABLE TIME BEFORE SHE FELT NO INCONVENIENCE THEREFROM BUT UPON HER DELIVERY THE CHILD WAS FOUND DEAD AND ITS BODY COVERED WITH THE SMALL POX THESE237 THESE TWO HISTORIES EVINCE THAT THE CHILD BEFORE BIRTH THOUGH CLOSELY DEFENDED FROM THE EXTERNAL AIR AND ENVELOPED BY FLUIDS AND MEMBRANES OF ITS OWN IS NOT SECURE FROM THE VARIOLOUS INFECTION THOUGH ITS MOTHER HAS HAD THE DISTEMPER BEFORE THEY DE MONSTRATE THE VERY GREAT SUBTILITY OF THE VARIOLOUS EFFLUVIA AS WE FIND THEM CAPABLE EITHER FROM THEIR FLOATING IN THE AIR AND BY THEIR BEING TAKEN IN BY THE INSPIRATION OF THE MOTHER OR BY PENETRATING THE ABSORBENT VESSELS UPON HER SKIN AND THUS MIXING WITH HER BLOOD OF EXERTING THEIR EFFECTS UPON THE CHILD AND WE MAY OBSERVE FURTHER FROM THE FIRST OF THESE CASES THAT IT IS POSSIBLE FOR THE CHILD TO LIVE THROUGH THE SMALL POX BEFORE ITS BIRTH AS WELL AS THAT AFTER THAT PERIOD UNDER THE BEFOREMENTIONED CIRCUMSTANCES IT IS NOT LIABLE TO THE INFECTION AGAIN THE FOLLOWING HISTORY IS EQUALLY REMARKABLE WITH THE PRECEDING A LADY OF HIGH BIRTH AND QUALITY NOW LIVING WELL KNOWN TO SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THIS LEARNED BO DY HAD THE SMALL POX TO A GREAT DEGREE WHEN SEVEN MONTHS GONE WITH CHILD NOTWITHSTANDING WHICH SHE WENT HER TIME AND WAS DELIVERED OF A SON WHO DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE UPON HIS BODY ANY MARKS OF THE DISTEMPER AS THIS LADY HAD BEEN SEVERELY HANDLED BY THE SMALL POX IT WAS JUDGED THAT HER CHILD WOULD NEVER AFTER BE LIABLE THERETO NEVERTHELESS WHEN ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS OLD HE WAS ATTACKED WITH THE DISTEMPER BUT GOT VERY WELL THROUGH IT AND IS NOW ALIVE A CASE IN SOME RESPECTS RESEMBLING THIS LAST IS TAKEN NOTICE OF BY MAURICEAU  WHO DELIVERED A WOMAN OF  SEE MAURICEAU SUR LES MALADIES DES FEMMES GROSSES CASE 576238 OF AN HEALTHY CHILD AT HER FULL TIME WHO DURING THE FIFTH MONTH OF HER GESTATION HAD HAD THE SMALL POX TO A GREAT DEGREE ALTHOUGH THE CHILD FROM ANY MARKS OF ITS BODY DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED WITH THE DISTEMPER THESE CASES ARE THE VERY REVERSE OF THE FORMER WHERE THOUGH FROM INOCULATION THE MOST MINUTE PORTION OF LINT MOISTENED WITH THE VARIOLOUS MAT TER AND APPLIED TO THE SLIGHTLY WOUNDED SKIN IS GE NERALLY SUFFICIENT TO PROPAGATE THIS DISTEMPER YET HERE WE SEC THAT THE WHOLE MASS OF THE MOTHERS BLOOD CIRCULATING DURING THE DISTEMPER THROUGH THE CHILD WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO PRODUCE IT IT GENERALLY HAPPENS AS WE ARE INFORMED BY MEDI CAL WRITERS AND AS I MYSELF HAVE SEEN IN PRACTICE THAT IF WOMEN ARE DELIVERED DURING THE COURSE OF THE SMALL POX THE DISTEMPER OF THE CHILD DOES NOT KEEP PACE WITH THAT OF ITS MOTHER BUT IS  THERETO THUS THE CHILD OF THE LADY MENTIOND BY THE LEARNED DR MEAD  WHO WAS BROUGHT TO BED ON THE ELEVENTH DAY WHEN LABOURING UNDER A VERY MA LIGNANT SMALL POX WAS BORN WITHOUT ANY APPEARANCE OF THE PUSTULES BUT ON THE FOURTH DAY AFTER ITS BIRTH THE CHILD WAS SEIZED WITH CONVULSIONS AND DIED AT THE ERUPTION OF THE SMALL POX AND IN A WOMAN WHOM I ATTENDED AND WHO WAS DELIVERED OF AN AP PARENTLY HEALTHY CHILD UPON THE NINTH DAY OF A DI STINCT SMALL POX THE CHILD WAS NOT SEIZED UNTIL THE EIGHTH DAY AFTER ITS BIRTH WHICH IS ABOUT THE TIME THAT THE INFECTION WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE IF IT HAD BEEN RECEIVED FROM ANY OTHER QUARTER INDEPENDENT OF ITS MOTHERS HAVING THE DISTEMPER BEFORE ITS BIRTH FROM  VIDE TRACT DE VARIOLIS PAG 66239 FROM THESE HISTORIES IT APPEARS THAT THE CHILD BE FORE ITS BIRTH OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERD AS A SEPARATE AS A DISTINCT ORGANISATION AND THAT THOUGH WHOLLY NOURISHD BY ITS MOTHERS FLUIDS WITH REGARD TO THE SMALL POX IT IS LIABLE TO BE AFFECTED IN A VERY DIFFE RENT MANNER AND AT A VERY DIFFERENT TIME FROM ITS MOTHER X

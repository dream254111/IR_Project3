j100128,Columbia Law Review,1111020,Effect of Defective Incorporation on Liability of Stockholders,i246289,COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW are uniformly expressive of a States policy20 and as such purely intraterritorial in scope and effect it may be argued not only that this policy is not contravened by the enforcement of a contract performable elsewhere but also that such legislation could not in its nature have been directed against nonresidents having performance without the jurisdiction in view21 It would seem that in such event although the contract becomes complete within the jurisdiction its laws would be operative to no greater degree than where a married woman under a disability affixes her signature to a contract which awaits completion in a state where her capacity is recognized22 Where therefore a con tract is performable without the jurisdiction of the place of con tracting by the laws of which a party thereto is incapacitated the courts may properly disregard the force of those laws it would seem23 and apply the law of the place of performance for the purpose of upholding the contract provided there be capacity by the domiciliary law24 and if the place of performance be the forum no violation of its policy25 This situation was presented to a New York court in the recent case of Hammerstein v Sylva 1910 124 N Y Supp 535 where the parties made a contract in France performable in New York where they were domiciled One of the parties although capable by New York law was it was assumed for the purposes of the decision incapable by French law The court held that since the validity of a contract was governed by the law of the place of performance capacity being conceived as included within the validity and since the defendant was capable both by the law of the domicile and of the place of performance the defendant was liable Although exception must be taken to the reasoning of the court prompting the adoption of the law of the place of performance as determinative of contractual capacity as well as to its enunciation of the vitality of the domiciliary law the result com mends itself as a modification of the American rule consistent with its purpose EFFECT OF DEFECTIVE INCORPORATION ON LIABILITY OF STOCKHOLDERS In the recent case of Jennings v Dark Ind 1910 92 N E 778 the Supreme Court of Indiana considered the status of stockholders of a defectively incorporated association and reached the conclusion that one who had dealt with the company as a corporation could not enforce the general liability of its members as partners The decision rested in 20Milliken v Pratt supra International Harvester Co v McAdam supra Armstrong etc Co v Best supra First Nat Bank v Shaw supra Gates v Bingham supra This would not however countenance the

as there was a valid law under which the association might have been formed and as it actually exer cised corporate powers in the belief that it had authority to do so by virtue of a prior act the plaintiff was estopped to deny the fact of incorporation It is not apparent however from the mere fact that the company had held itself out as a corporation and thereby induced the plaintiff to deal with it as such that the defendant stockholders have so changed their position that a denial by the plaintiff of the corporateness of the association would work a fraud upon the defend ants1 and the basis for an equitable estoppel would therefore seem to be nonexistent2 It is true that the defendants themselves might be estopped to deny their incorporations but as there is no mutuality in an equitable estoppel4 this ground for the decision finds its only sup port in the argument that since the creation of a corporation results from an act of the sovereign power having the force of a record both parties are estopped to deny the existence of a legal entity5 However applicable this theory might be to the case of an association called into existence by virtue of a special act of the legislature it would seem to be of little force when members of a company are seeking to avoid individual liability by asserting incorporation under a general law6 The situation of the stockholders apparently is not essentially different from that of any person who claims an exemption from liability through compliance with a rule of the common law and in neither case unless exceptional facts are present would the opposing party be estopped to deny the fact of compliance The conclusion that the members of a company which has irregu larly assumed the powers and seeks the rights and privileges of a corporation are not individually liable for debts contracted in the operation of the business finds support however in the argument of the Indiana Court7 that as the state alone is directly affected by the assumption of the rights peculiar to a legal entity the corporateness of the association is not open to collateral attack but may be inquired into only at the instance of one whose rights have been invaded8 1See 6 COLUMBIA LAW REIEW 8 9 See Electric Light Co v Gas Co 1897 99 Tenn 371 Edmonson v Montague 1848 14 Ala 370 See Order of Mutual Aid v Paine 1887 122 Ill 625 Empire Mfg

favor of an association which exists without color of law It is applied generally only to corporations de facto for which three essential conditions must concur there must be a valid law under which a corporation having the powers assumed might have been formed there must have been a bona fide attempt at substantial compliance with the provisions of the statute and there must have been an actual exercise of corporate powers in good faith Doty v Patterson I9oo 155 Ind 6o Richards v Minnesota Sav Bank I89975 Minn I96 cf The Journal Co v Nelson I9o8 133 Mo App 482 NOTES 161COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW This doctrine would seem to date its origin from the period when all corporations were public in character and were the product of royal charter or of special act of legislature9 It was therefore in accordance with the principles of the common law that when the recipients of the privilege endeavored to conform to the charter and had actually entered upon a user of the powers thereby granted the sovereign alone would be allowed to complain that this user was not entirely regular10 Where there is a general law however the act by means of which incorporation may be effected is of a different nature1l The state permits a group of individuals who have conformed to the statutory requirements to act as a distinct entity with enumerated powers and with certain rights privileges and immunities among which is gener ally an exemption of the stockholder from individual liability for the corporate debts12 As compliance with the statute is the condition upon which this exemption is granted there would seem to be no valid reason why a denial of the allegation of incorporation should not put in issue the fact of conformity to its provisions13 The members have undoubtedly entered upon a common enterprise with a view to profit and as according to the better opinion a specific intent to become partners is not necessary to the formation of a partnership14 such would appear to be their true relation if for any reason the attempt to incorporate failed of fulfillmentl5 And as under the rules of the common law members of an unincorporated jointstock company were in the absence of legislative enactment individually liable for the debts incurred in the pursuit of the common business16 it would seem that where this liability is sought to be avoided by virtue of incorpora tion under a general law the burden of proving compliance with the law should rest upon the party asserting it17 The contrary result See Williston The History of the Law of Business Corporations be fore

Minnesota Sav Bank supra and see Harrill v Davis squpra that to hold the innocent members of an association in the management of which they have taken no active part individually liable for the debts of the company would be too unjust to warrant judicial approval see Stafford Bank v Palmer r880 47 Conn 443 nor would such a conclusion require the court to write a new contract for the 162reached in Jennings v Dark although in accord with the weight of authority18 would therefore appear to be erroneous upon principle and the members of the association it is submitted should have been held liable upon the contract as general partners CREATION OF THE RELATION OF DEBTOR AND CREDITOR BETWEEN BANKER AND OUSTOMERThe legal relations between banker and customer though theoretically regulated entirely by contract are in the absence of express stipulation determined by commercial usage in contemplation of which the parties are presumed to have dealt The legal consequences of this complicated contract are on the other hand ascertained by the application of fundamental principles of agency and negotiable paper While the numerical weight of authority has in accordance with sound theory deduced the rule that the liabil ity of a bank receiving paper to be sent for collection to a distant point is dependent entirely upon the exercise of due care in the selection of a suitable correspondent a considerable number of courts have nevertheless established the contrary doctrine of absolute liabil ity by interpolating into the contract a term discernible neither in commercial usage nor in the reasonably presumable intention of the parties This doctrine though originally founded on a supposed analogy to the liability of an independent contractor for the torts of his servant2 is now based on broad and persuasive considerations of public policy indicating that the recognition by law of this obliga tion which is like that of a del credere factor will best promote the general welfare of the commercial community3 The property rights in negotiable instruments transferred to a bank are like the other incidents of the contract derived primarily from the nature of the original transaction If the checks or drafts are regarded by both parties as so much cash the contract is one of deposit and title to the paper passes to the banker who as in the case of a general deposit of cash becomes forthwith the debtor of his customer4 If however the instrument is received for collection merely title remains in the customer and the relation between him and the banker is that of principal and agent5 The mere fact that the collecting bank has credited the depositor with the amount of his parties see however Hoyt v McCallum I902 xo2 Ill App 287 but merely results from an application of the rules of law to the contract as written by them nor is there involved a nullification of franchises Francis M Burdick Are Defectively Incorporated Associations Partner ships 6

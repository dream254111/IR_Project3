shame hasty little man a sentence from one of President Eliots lectures is the keynote to much of his work for he has made natures patient ways his own He celebrates tomorrow March 20 his seventieth birthday and this year also the thirtyfifth anniversary of his presi dency of Iffarvard iFor an estimate of his achievements this is neither the place nor the time the limits of an editorial article are too narrow and his labors are we trust far from an end Serus tn coeZum redeat But we add our hearty congratulations to those of Harvard graduates friends of learning from all colleges and schools and worthy citi zens in every walk of life and we seize this moment as suitable for dwelling on two or three aspects of President Eliots career He stands among the foremost citizens of the United States were there a common denomi nator by which one could meaKsure men of widely dierent talents and callings he might rank the very first This success is indubi tably due in large part to a power which has wrought like the force of a glacier without haste and without rest It is as an educator that he enjoys the widest fame For more than a third of a century a period of unexampled material progress in a country which has leaped for ward rather than developed he has been at the head of our oldest and richest university He has thus enjoyed a unique opportunity to set his stamp upon the educational system of a nation and this opportunity he has em ployed to the uttermost The principles which he intended to follow he laid down with precision in his Inaugural Address in 1869 from those principles he hgs neve swerved Iffe declared  This university rec ognizes no real antagonism between literature and science and consents to no such narrow alternatives as mathematics or classics sci ence or metaphysics We would have them all and at their best Against the old hard and fast curriculunz one primer one cate chism one rod for all children he set his face unflinchingly and proceeded to build up the elective system which at Harvard already rested on a firm foundation The opposition within his faculty and without was deter mined sometimes bitter His theory that  a wellinstructed youth of eighteen can select for himself not for any other boy or for the fictitious universal boy but for himself alone a better course of study than any college faculty or any wise man who does not know him and his ancestors and his previous life can possibly select for him  this theory was assailed and ridiculed as individualism run mad 13ut President Eliot held to his course and he has seen his theory accepted in every important college of the country He has weathered the storm that raged about him twenty years ago alld has anchored in the desired haven As champion of a movement which put sciences and modern languages in  fair com petition with the classics he has urged un ceasingly more skillful instruction in these new subjects In his Inaugural he bluntly told the scientific scoffers at gerund grind ing  that  the prevailing methods of teach ing science the world over are less intelligent than the methods of teaching language Ex perimentation in the laboratory original in vestigation drill in accurate observations he has made the burden of many addresses and reports BiLoreover it is owing largely to his efforts that the standard of professional schools has been raised and that secondary and grammar schools are now reorganizing their programs according to the modern idea of developing the aptitudes of the individual But it is upon English that he has laid the greatest stress He began his presidency bySCIENCE 513 MARaH 25 1904 Chancellor in an empire of education or to recur to a former comparison as if he were really a glacier Time has proved the falsity of this first impression has shown that no college president has endured with more se renity and goodt humor the criticism of his colleagues that the springs of his kindnesss are as unfailing as the waters that melt from the eternal ice He has reached the goal of his ambition In describing Dr Asa Grays life as  happy he declared  It is the great est of human rewards to be enfolded as years advance in an atmosphere of honor gratitude and love That greatest of rewards Presi dent Eliot himself has reaped in full measure while his eye is not dim nor his natural force abated New York Eventng Post NOTES ON INORGANIC CHEMlETRY WATER GAS IN THE CHEMICAL LABORATORY A PAPER was recently read before the So ciety of Chemical Industry by Masume Chi kashige and Hitoshi Matsumoto on the defects of uncarburetted water gas as a fuel for labo ratory use Inasmuch as water gas is more or less extensively used in cities and as small local watergas plants are easily installed ex tended studies of its use have been made by the authors resulting in its condemnation Among the reasons given for these conclusions are the following which seem most important While the watergas flame is nonluminous and always powerfully reducing it is often desired to have a smoky flame temporarily which is impossible with this gas nor is it possible to produce a flame to any consider able extent oxidizing in its nature The air openings in a 13unsen burner are useless as it is not possible to mix more than a very slight proportion of air with the gas without pro ducing an explosive mixture The intense heat of the flame far higher than can be ob tained with coal gas is not an unqualified ad vantage as it occasions the rapid destruction of wire gauze and copper vessels copper air baths and waterbaths are rapidly destroyed unless provided with castiron bolstoms Ow ing to the presence of carbon monoxid nickel vessels are quickly corroded some crucibles being burnt completely through in a single quoting Lockes complaint as to the neglect of the mothertongue and he has returned to the theme again and again At Harvard he has built up an DEnglish department that has been a stimulus to every other college and to schools of all grades In this vast enterpriset President Eliot him self the moving spirit has had neither the authority nor the will to force the action of faculties or committees More than once he has seen his opinions thrown into the arena of open debate and voted down But convinced that his views if sound will ultimately tri umph he has waited with Olympian calm for the march of events Though the immediate effect of the changes has in some cases seemed to be chaos he has never been discouraged he has shown that to rearrange a curriculum to train competent instructors in new subjects to establish traditions of  mental discipline will be the task of generations yet to come In his discussion of public questions he has insisted upon the right of the individual to attain his highest intellectual and lnoral de velopment unchecked by a castiron regimen of studies or by intolerance in church or state His criticisms of organized labor have voiced the conviction of our sanest publicists that  democracy must profoundly distrust the labor unions too frequent effort to restrict the efficiency and the output of the individual workman This doctrine of individualism a tenet of the liberals of the old school is fall ing into temporary decay it is opposed by certain captains of industry who want to crush out the individual and pile merger upon merger it is opposed by the trades unionists who condemn all laborers to the lockstep yet President Eliot has steadily with candor and courage striven for the basic principle of our Declaration of Independence These are the achievements these the quali ties that have won him year by year a wider recognition have transmuted cold respect into afEection In the earlier days of his pres idency a reserve of manner absorption in details of administration and a frank indif ference to the gusts of undergraduate senti ment made students regard him with an un comfortable awe as if he were a sort of Iron

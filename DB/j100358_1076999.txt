J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1076999,CURRICULUM ADJUSTMENTS IN MODERN HIGH SCHOOLS,I244669,THE SCHOOL REVIEW A JOURNAL OF SECONDARY EDUCATION VOLUME XXII NOVEMBER 1914 NUMBER 9 CURRICULUM ADJUSTMENTS IN MODERN HIGH SCHOOLS CHARLES HUGHES JOHNSTON PROFESSOR OF SECONDARY EDUCATION UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS A COLLEGE OFFICER RECENTLY SPOKE OF CURRICULUM BUILDING AS THE FAVORITE INDOOR SPORT OF EDUCATORS THE GAME IS USUALLY PLAYED ACCORDING TO HOYLE AND THE SCORES ARE USUALLY PUBLISHED IN ANNUAL REPORTS THERE BEING NO WAY OF MAKING COMPARISONS OF THESE SCORES HE DECLARED WE HAVE NO NATIONAL CHAMPION ANY SCHOOL OR ANY SCHOOLMASTER CAN BE FIGURED AS WINNER THIS CRITIC ADDS THAT HE THINKS AMERICANS CONSTITUTIONMAKERS BY RIGHT MECHANI CAL GENIUSES WITH INSTINCTS FOR STANDARDIZATION WITH ALL THEIR COGS CUT TO THE SAME BEVEL AND WITH RIGID ALIGNMENT OF MOVING PARTS IN THEIR MACHINERY OF SCHOOL ORGANIZATION SUCCEED BEST AT THIS KIND OF EDUCATIONAL BUSINESS AS OUR KEEN AND HUMOROUS CRITIC SEES SO CLEARLY THERE ARE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THINGS IN EDUCATION THAN OUR CURRICULUMS ONE OF THESE OF COURSE IS THE TEACHER OTHERS WOULD RANK AHEAD OF CURRICULUM THINKING AND CURRICULUM BUILDING SUCH MATTERS AS BUILD INGS EQUIPMENT SHOPS AND LABORATORIES GYMNASIUM AND ATHLETIC FIELD LIBRARY SYSTEM OF SUPERVISION SPIRIT OF COOPERATION ETC OUR OWN EVALUATION WILL DEPEND LARGELY UPON WHETHER WE TAKE OUR CURRICULUM PHILOSOPHY SERIOUSLY OR SUPERFICIALLY IREAD BEFORE THE DEPARTMENT OF SCIENCE INSTRUCTION OF THE NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION JULY IO I9I4 577THE SCHOOL REVIEW THERE ARE TWO METHODS OF CURRICULUM PLANNING ONE IS CLERICAL AND MANIPULATIVE THE OTHER DISCRIMINATING AND EDUCATIONAL AC CORDING TO THE FORMER PLAN A HIGHSCHOOL PRINCIPAL WILL TAKE BEFORE HIM HIS PROGRAM OF ALL THE HIGHSCHOOL SUBJECTS SPLIT THEM UP INTO THE COMBINATION YEARCOURSES HIS TEACHING FORCE CAN CARRY MARK OFF ON A SHEET OF PAPER PERPENDICULAR PARALLEL COLUMNS AND PROCEED TO NAME EACH COLUMN SOMEWHAT AS FOLLOWS CLASSICAL SCIENTIFIC ENGLISH COMMERCIAL NORMALTRAINING AND WILL ADD PERHAPS AS A KIND OF EXTRA DRAGNET A COLUMN WHICH HE WILL DESIGNATE ELECT IVE WITH THIS OUTLINE HE WILL PLAN HIS DAILY AND WEEKLY SCHEDULE OF CLASSES THE ASSIGNMENT OF WORK TO TEACHERS THE NUMBER OF TEACHINGHOURS PER TEACHER PER WEEK AND THE RECITATIONS PER WEEK PER SUBJECT BEING DETERMINED EACH YEAR BY THE EXIGENCIES AND TEMPORARY POLICIES OF THIS MECHANICAL SCHEDULE DEVISING USUALLY WITH THIS SORT OF CURRICULUM MAKING THERE IS NO SYSTEM OF ADVICE AND GUIDANCE FOR THE PUPILS IN THEIR ELECTIONS OF STUDIES THE VERY EXISTENCE OF SUCH A METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION OF CURRICULUMS INDI CATES THAT THERE IS IN THE MINDS OF THE SCHOOL FORCE NO CONCEPTION OF MODERN EDUCATIONAL AND VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE IN SUCH A SCHOOL ALSO THERE IS NO SPIRIT OF COOPERATION BETWEEN PRINCIPAL AND TEACHERS AND NONE BETWEEN PUPILS AND TEACHERS ON THE CONTRARY TEACHERS ARE FOUND TO BE COMPETING WITH EACH OTHER WITH SUCH A CURRICULUM POLICY WE SHALL GENERALLY FIND THAT THE PRINTED DIFFERENTIATED CURRICULUMS ARE MERELY PAPER CURRICULUMS AND THAT IN PRACTICE NO CLEAR DISTINCTION IS MADE BETWEEN THE FOUR OR FIVE DIFFERENT LINES OF WORK ADVERTISED THIS FOR EXAMPLE WAS JUST WHAT THE RUSSELL SAGE FOUNDATION SURVEY OF THE HIGH SCHOOL OF SPRINGFIELD DID FIND FIVE PRINTED CURRICULUMS WHEN THE UNSUPER VISED PUPIL ELECTION CARDS SHOWED THAT ONLY ONE CURRICULUM WAS ACTUALLY PROVIDED IN PRACTICE THIS CURRICULUM WAS THE COLLEGE PREPARATORY DESPITE THE FACT THAT ONLY I6 PUPILS OUT OF A HIGH SCHOOL ENROLMENT OF 883 WENT TO ANY COLLEGE THE OTHER TYPE OF CURRICULUM THINKING AND BUILDING COM BINED WHICH I HAVE CALLED DISCRIMINATING AND GENUINELY EDUCATIONAL SHOWS EVIDENCE OF DESIGN IN ITS CONSTRUCTION NO ONE CONSTRUCTS A BUILDING FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING IT MERELY A HOUSE THIS IS HOWEVER EXACTLY THE PRINCIPLE UPON WHICH MANY STILL CONSTRUCT HIGHSCHOOL CURRICULUMS THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF VAGUENESS AND 578CURRICULUM ADJUSTMENTS IN HIGH SCHOOLS SENTIMENTALISM TOO IN THE POPULAR CLAIM IN THIS CONNECTION THAT WE ARE IN HIGH SCHOOL TO MAKE JUST MEN NOT MEN OF TRADES AND VOCATIONS IT IS DIFFICULT IN AMERICA AT LEAST TO IMAGINE A MERE MAN WITH NO TRADE OR OCCUPATION WHOM WE COULD RESPECT IT IS EQUALLY DIFFICULT TO THINK OF ONE WHO IS GENUINELY EDUCATED WHO IS NOT EDUCATED ESPECIALLY AND LIBERALLY IN HIS OWN PROFESSION ON GENERAL PRINCIPLES WHICH I AM PREPARED TO DEFEND I LAY DOWN THE PROPOSITION THAT CURRICULUM DIFFERENTIATION IS NECESSARY WHEREVER POSSIBLE IN HIGH SCHOOLS AND THAT THE BASIS FOR SUCH DIFFERENTIATION MUST BE THE DEMANDS OF THE DIFFERENT GROUPS OF OUR HIGHSCHOOL PUPIL BODIES THESE GROUPS PARTIALLY SEGREGATED ON THE BASIS OF THEIR DIFFERENT VOCATIONAL NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS THESE PUPIL GROUPS AND THEIR CURRICULUM NEEDS ARE FACTS NOT KNOWN TO THE PRINCIPALS OF HIGH SCHOOLS NOW BUT THEY MUST BE KNOWN AND MUST MODIFY OUR CURRICULUM MAKING WE SHOULD THINK NATURALLY OF A MAN AS ONE WHO AFTER SCHOOL LIFE STEPS UP NOT DOWN INTO SOCIETY AND DONS HIS WORKING CLOTHES AND ASSUMES HIS VOCATIONAL ATTITUDE PLATO SET US A MODEL OF CURRICULUM THINKING STILL UNSURPASSED IN MANY RESPECTS THE LACK OF DIFFERENTIATION FOR DIFFERENT GROUPS WHO ARE TO BE EDUCATED MARKS THE ELEMENT OF WEAKNESS IN HIS IDEAL SCHEME SO FAR AS OUR MODERN HIGHSCHOOL INSTRUCTIONAL AND TRAINING OFFERINGS ARE CONCERNED HERBERT SPENCER IN HIS FIRST ESSAY ON EDUCATION SET ANOTHER PACE FOR CURRICULUMMAKERS AND GAVE A BETTER ILLUSTRATION OF THE DEFINITE STEPS NECESSARY IN ACTUALLY MAKING SPECIFIC CURRICULUMS HIS DOCTRINE OF THE RELATIVE VALUES OF DIFFER ENT EDUCATIONAL ENDS TO BE ATTAINED BY CURRICULUMS AND HIS FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE HIERARCHY OF SUBJECTS OF INSTRUCTION TO BE EMPLOYED IN GAINING THE ENDS SOUGHT OFFERS STILL A MODEL OF METHOD FOR THE AM BITIOUS CURRICULUMBUILDERS OF TODAY SPENCERS GREATEST CONTRIBU TION HERE IS THAT HE NAMED OUR PROBLEM FOR US HE DID HIS WORK SO THOROUGHLY THAT WE ARE ABLE TO DISAGREE CLEARLY WITH HIM IN THE VERY STATEMENT OF OUR DISSENT SPENCER FORCES US TO FUNDAMENTAL CON SIDERATIONS SPENCER BUILDS FOR US ONE CURRICULUM BUILDS IT SO WELL AND KNITS EACH PART TO THE OTHER SO PLAUSIBLY AND WITH SO MUCH FAITH OUTLINES THE RAMIFICATIONS OF EDUCATIONAL EFFECTS WE ARE TO EXPECT THAT HE ALMOST PERSUADES US NOT ONLY THAT HERE IS A GOOD CURRICULUM BUT THAT IT IS THE ONLY NECESSARY ONEA CURRICULUM OF SCIENCE CURRICULUMMAKERS LIKE OTHER PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS SOUGHT THE 579THE SCHOOL REVIEW PHILOSOPHERS STONE THE SINGLE PANACEA SPENCER WAS AS OLD CATO WHAT THOMAS DIXON CALLS ONE OF THE WORLDS ONEEYED FOOLS FIRST HE THOUGHT THAT GIVING ALL SUBJECTS A SCIENTIFIC FLAVOR WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF CURRICULUM NEEDS HE DID NOT REALIZE HOW COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT OF APPLICATION HIS CONCEPTION OF SCIENCE WAS TO PROVE TO BE SECOND AS ROYCE REMARKS HE THOUGHT NAIVELY THAT THE WORLD SHOULD ULTIMATELY BE MADE UP OF LITTLE HERBERTS MEN AS WILLIAM JAMES SAYS OF SPENCER OF REMORSELESS EXPLICIT NESS OF PEDANTIC RECTITUDE WITH CURIOUS DRYNESS AND LITERAL NESS OF JUDGMENT A LUKEWARM EQUABLE TEMPERAMENT NARROWNESS OF SYMPATHY AND PASSION FONDNESS FOR MECHANICAL FORMS OF THOUGHT AND IMPERFECT RECEPTIVITY SPENCER PLANNED FOR ALL TO BE TRAINED FOR SPECIAL PROFESSIONAL CAPACITIES IN THE APPLICATION OF SCIENTIFIC LAWS GENERALLY HE SAW NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GREAT POPULAR NEED AND ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND AND PROFIT BY KNOWLEDGE OF SCIENCE AND THE STRICTLY LIMITED NEEDS OF THE PROFESSIONAL SCIENTISTS THEM SELVES WE DO NOT ADMIT TODAY THAT WHAT IS ESSENTIAL TO THE SPECIALIST MUST BE FED IN PAINFUL BROKEN DOSES TO THE RACE THAT OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION IN SANITATION IS IDENTICAL WITH THAT OF THE PLUMBERS OR THAT OUR FAMILY KNOWLEDGE OF ANTISEPTICS MUST BE ACQUIRED IF AT ALL IN THE SAME WAY THAT A SURGEON PREPARES HIMSELF FOR THE PRACTICE OF HIS PROFESSION AGAIN IN MODERN CURRICULUM MAKING WE CANNOT RELY ON THE OTHER BASIS PROPOSED SERIOUSLY BY SPENCER NAMELY AS YOCUM HAS NOTED THAT WHAT HAS PROVED EFFECTIVE IN THE PAST SURVIVALS OF THE RACE IS NOW STILL A SUFFICIENT BASIS ON THE OTHER HAND HERE AGAIN WE MUST NOTE THAT WE HAVE A HETEROGENEOUS PUPIL BODY OF ONE AND ONEHALF MILLION ADOLESCENT BOYS AND GIRLS REPRESENTING MANY SIDED SOCIAL APPEALS NATIONAL STATE MUNICIPAL RURAL APPEALS ALSO OF EVERY SOCIAL GRADE AND OF A BEWILDERING VARIETY OF VOCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS THESE APPEALS MUST BE ANALYZED FOR OUR DIFFERENT ACTUAL PUPIL GROUPS CLASSIFIED EVALUATED AS LEADING TO ENERGIZING OR NONENERGIZING VOCATIONS AND FOR SPENCERS ACADEMIC BASIS WE MUST SUBSTITUTE THE PRINCIPLE OF DESIGNING COURSES AND CURRICU LUMS ACCORDING TO WHETHER THEY HAVE OR DO NOT HAVE SYSTEMATIZED INFORMATION AND DEFINITE TRAININGS WE MUST KNOW IN A GIVEN CASE WHICH OF THESE KNOWLEDGES AND TRAININGS ARE REQUISITE FOR AND COMMON TO THE LIFE DEMANDS OF THE MAJORITY IN EACH OF THE 58OCURRICULUM ADJUSTMENTS IN HIGH SCHOOLS GROUPS INTO WHICH WE CAN FOR THIS CURRICULUM PURPOSE BREAK UP OUR PARTICULAR BODIES OF HIGHSCHOOL PUPILS SPENCER DID NOT AN TICIPATE AND MANY MODERN WRITERS DO NOT SEE THIS ERA OF CURRICULUM DIFFERENTIATION THAT IS UPON US MANY DO HOWEVER AND IT IS TO THESE WE MUST LOOK FOR TENTATIVE SOLUTIONS AND METHODS OF ATTACK RECENT WRITERS ARE SERIOUSLY AND PROFOUNDLY ATTACKING THIS PROBLEM AND SEEKING TO FORMULATE PRECISELY THOSE FUNDAMENTAL GUIDING PRINCIPLES BY MEANS OF WHICH DESIGNERS OF HIGHSCHOOL CURRICULUMS MAY MORE EFFECTIVELY ADMINISTER A SYSTEMATICALLY PLANNED PROGRAM OF INSTRUCTION IN ANY PARTICULAR CASE BAGLEYS EDUCATIONAL VALUES IS ONE NOTABLE EXAMPLE OF THIS MODERN ATTEMPT TO DISTINGUISH RELATIVE FUNCTIONS AND VALUES SNEDDENS EDUCA TIONAL READJUSTMENT IS ANOTHER ATTEMPT APPROACHING THE REAL QUES TION FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF A STUDENT OF SOCIOLOGY AND ECONOMICS AS WELL AS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF A PRACTICAL SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR WHO MUST MAKE TYPE CURRICULUMS DAILY FOR ACTUAL SCHOOLS WHILE BAGLEYS TREATMENT IS PRIMARILY PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PEDAGOGICAL ALTHOUGH ERECTING SOCIAL EFFICIENCY AS THE CONTROLLING AIM OF A COURSE OR A CURRICULUM WEEKS IN HIS EDUCATION OF TOMORROW IS MORE RADICAL THAN EITHER OF THE OTHER WELLKNOWN EDUCATORS HIS APPROACH IS RATHER NARROWLY THAT OF THE ECONOMISTS AND HIS TERMINOLOGY FOR EDUCATIONAL VALUES AND FUNCTIONS SMACKS OF THE DOLLAR MARK AND THE SHOP A BIT PARTLY BECAUSE OF THIS SHOP LANGUAGE DOUBTLESS YOCUM IN HIS CULTURE DISCIPLINE AND DEMOCRACY STRIKES DEEP ROOT AND RAISES FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES ALSO EVERYWHERE BUT HIS PHILOSOPHY AND PSYCHOLOGY ARE THOSE OF THE OLD ENGLISH SCHOOL OF ASSOCIATIONISM AND THE READER TRAINED EXCLUSIVELY IN THE MODERN SCHOOLS OF PHILOSOPHY AND PSYCHOLOGY OR NOT TRAINED IN ANY SCHOOL MAY FIND HIS APPROACH A BIT DIFFICULT EVEN THOUGH HE WILL BE WELL REPAID FOR HIS PAINS IF HE WISHES TO DO HIS CURRICULUM THINKING IN TERMS OF A NEOHERBARTIAN PATTERN HE HAS ACCESS NOW TO DEGARMOS REVISED AND MUCHIMPROVED PRINCIPLES OF SECONDARY EDUCATION BASIC IDEALS AND THE STUDIES IF HE WANTS THE MOST MODERN CURRICULUM SPECULATION AND REPORTING HE CAN GO AND WITH PROFIT TO THE VARIOUS SURVEYS THE SECTIONS ON THE HIGH SCHOOL NOTABLY THE PORTLAND SURVEY THE VERMONT SURVEY THE NEW YORK SURVEY AND THE VERY RECENT SURVEY OF THE SCHOOLS OF SPRINGFIELD ILLINOIS BY THE RUSSELL SAGE FOUNDATION 58ITHE SCHOOL REVIEW DO ALL OF THIS RADICALISM AND SOME SENSATIONALISM AND MUCH ANALYSIS WITH REFERENCE TO THE THOROUGHGOING RECONSTRUCTION OF OUR METHODS OF ADMINISTERING INSTRUCTION IN HIGH SCHOOLS MEAN EITHER THAT THE HIGH SCHOOLS ARE INEFFICIENT OR THAT ANYONE HAS A READY SOLUTION FOR THE CURRICULUM DIFFICULTIES  I DO NOT THINK THAT EITHER IS THE CASE A PROMINENT HIGHSCHOOL PRINCIPAL W L FELTER OF GIRLS HIGH SCHOOL OF BROOKLYN THINKS THAT AT PRESENT THE HIGH SCHOOLS ARE GIVING AN INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE MOTHERTONGUE AND ITS PRICELESS STOREHOUSE OF LITERATURE THE STUDY OF ONE OR MORE FOREIGN LANGUAGES SOME SKILL IN MATHE MATICS SOME CONSIDERABLE STUDY OF HISTORY A LITTLE SCIENCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE POWER TO MAKE GRAPHIC REPRESENTATION AND A BOWING ACQUAINTANCE WITH MUSIC THIS IN BRIEF IS THE EQUIPMENT  THE OLD LINE CURRICULUM MUST STAND IT HAS JUSTIFIED ITS EXISTENCE BY ITS WORKS IT IS TRUE HOWEVER THAT A COURSE OF STUDY CURRICULUM REPRESENTS A STATE OF NEEDS ALREADY PAST FOR EXAMPLE A PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE RESULTS OF THE REGENTS EXAMINA TIONS IN PHYSICS TAKEN BY THE NEW YORK CITY HIGH SCHOOLS FOR A TERM OF FIVE YEARS SHOWED THAT THE BOYS SCHOOLS NO MATTER WHAT THEIR STANDINGS MIGHT BE IN OTHER SUBJECTS WERE ALWAYS IN THE FIRST GROUP THE MIXED SCHOOLS WERE IN THE SECOND GROUP WHILE THE GIRLS SCHOOLS NO MATTER WHAT THEIR STANDINGS WERE IN OTHER SUBJECTS ALWAYS BROUGHT UP THE REAR  ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS ASKED OF EVERY SUBJECT IN THE HIGH SCHOOL WILL BE DOES IT FUNC TION IS IT TRUE THAT MANY OF THE SUBJECTS EITHER DO NOT FUNCTION IN THEM SELVES OR THAT THEY ARE PRESENTED TOO MUCH WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR PURE ASPECTS WITHOUT REGARD TO THEIR APPLICATION IN CONTEMPORARY LIFE AND ACTIVITY  DO THEY FUNCTION IN LIFE SOCIAL AND INDIVIDUAL AS IT IS NOW LIVED  DO THEY REVEAL RESULTS IN TERMS OF IDEALS AND KNOWLEDGES IN ACTION  EVERY SUBJECT IS UP FOR DISCUSSION FOR EXAMINATION FOR ACCEPTANCE OR REJECTION  THE CLEARER DEFINITION OF AIMS THE SEARCH FOR A SCIENTIFIC BASIS OF METHOD THE TESTING OF EACH SUBJECT FOR ITS FUNCTIONING POWER RICHER AND FULLER SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY SEPARATE COURSES OF STUDY CURRICULUMS FOR BOYS AND GIRLS FLEXIBLE CURRICULUMS SHORTER COURSES CURRICULUMS MORE TYPES OF HIGH SCHOOLS THESE ARE ALL SUGGESTED SOLUTIONS FOR PRESENT DIFFICULTIES THIS MODERN STATEMENT FROM A HIGHSCHOOL PRINCIPAL REFLECTS A MOST ENCOURAGING ATTITUDE TOWARD WHAT I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DISTINGUISH AS A SECOND TYPE OF CURRICULUM BUILDING A RECENT INVESTIGATION BY ONE OF MY GRADUATE STUDENTS OF SOCALLED HIGHSCHOOL COURSES OF STUDY FROM FIFTYFOUR HIGH SCHOOLS IN TOWNS OF OVER 4000 POPULATION REPRESENTING PRACTICALLY EVERY STATE IN THE UNION AND REPRESENTATIVE ALSO OF THE SMALLER 582CURRICULUM ADJUSTMENTS IN HIGH SCHOOLS CITIES OF THESE STATES SHOWED A TOTAL OF 93 SUBJECTS OFFERED 50 OF WHICH MAY BE FAIRLY CLASSED AS VOCATIONAL FOURTEEN OF THESE SCHOOLS ADVERTISED NO CURRICULUMS BUT ADMINISTERED THE STUDIES ON SOME FORM OF THE ELECTIVE PLAN THE OTHER 40 SCHOOLS OFFERED I86 PAPER CURRICULUMS THESE IN MOST CASES WERE NOT OF COURSE GENUINE CURRICULUMS THEY WERE MERELY PRINTED DEVICES WHICH SHOWED A SORT OF MANIPULATIVE DEXTERITY ON THE PART OF THE PRINCIPAL OR THE SUPERINTENDENT AS IN THE CASE CITED ABOVE THESE PAPER DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN POSSIBLE ORGANIZATIONS OF INSTRUCTION WERE NOT REFLECTED PROBABLY IN PUPILS ELECTIONS OF STUDIES THEY DO REFLECT WHAT IS VERY ENCOURAGING AND WHAT IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE MODERN HIGH SCHOOL THAT WE ARE IN AN ERA OF CURRICULUM EXPERIMENTATION A MOVEMENT FAR WIDER IN SCOPE AND IN SIGNIFICANCE THAN ANY PURELY PEDAGOGICAL REVOLUTION CAN EVER BE GENUINE CURRICULUM EXPERI MENTATION INVOLVES THE CONSCIOUS AND COOPERATIVE EXPERIMENTATION OF THE WHOLE SCHOOL AS AN INSTITUTION BY THE WHOLE SCHOOL FORCE IT IS TO BE EXPECTED THAT THESE TWENTYFIVE OR MORE PARTIALLY DIS TINGUISHABLE PAPER CURRICULUMS WILL NOT IMMEDIATELY FUNCTION AND THAT MANY OF THEM WILL EVENTUALLY PROVE TO BE MISNOMERS IT IS SIGNIFICANT THAT SO MANY ARE PROJECTED WE ARE EXPLOITING VARIOUS SCHEMES OF INSTRUCTION NOW AS WE ONCE EXPLOITED VARIOUS KINDS OF NOVEL INFORMATION COURSES THESE FOUR WEEKS COURSES OF TWO DECADES AGO ARE ABANDONED NOW BUT OUR CURRICULUM IS ENRICHED WE PRESERVED THE IDEA NOW WE ARE EXPLOITING A LARGER UNIT THAN THE SINGLE COURSE OR THE SINGLE SUBJECT IT IS UNWIELDY AT FIRST BUT IT IS A STEP BEYOND THE LINEOFLEASTRESISTANCE PRACTICE OF AN UNSUPER VISED OR IMPROVISED ELECTIVE PLAN OF ADMINISTERING BROKEN DOSES OF INSTRUCTION WHAT THEN IS A CURRICULUM  WHAT ARE THE METHODS OF ADMIN ISTERING CURRICULUMS  IN THE ABSENCE OF SCIENTIFICALLY DEMONSTRATED AND TESTED FOUNDATIONS FOR CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION WHAT PRACTICAL BASES MAY SERVE US AS TEMPORARY GUIDES  A CURRICULUM OFTEN LOOSELY CALLED A COURSE OF STUDY IS ANY SYSTEMATIC AND SCHEMATIC ARRANGEMENT OF COURSES WHICH EXTENDS THROUGH A NUMBER OF YEARS AND WHICH LEADS TO A CERTIFICATE OR DIPLOMA AND WHICH IS PLANNED FOR ANY CLEARLY DIFFERENTIATED GROUP OF HIGHSCHOOL PUPILS ADMINISTRATIVELY A CURRICULUM 583THE SCHOOL REVIEW REPRESENTS AN ARRANGEMENT OF COURSES WITHIN WHICH A PUPIL IS RESTRICTED IN HIS CHOICE OF WORK LEADING TO GRADUATION AN ORDINARY FOURYEAR CURRICULUM REPRESENTS NOT LESS THAN FIFTEEN UNIT CREDITS OF WORK AS THERE ARE RELATIVELY FEW CLEARLY DIFFERENTIATED CURRICULUMS CURRICULUMBUILDERS ARE STRUGGLING MOSTLY WITH SEMICURRICULUM PROBLEMS SUCH PROBLEMS INVOLVE QUESTIONS AS TO WHAT DEVICES AND POLICIES FOR REGULATING PUPILS CHOICES OF SUBJECTS AND COURSES IN FIELDS OF EITHER ALLIED GROUPS OR SEQUENTIAL GROUPS OF COURSES SHOULD BE ADOPTED AN ALLIED GROUP OF COURSES REFERS TO STUDIES WHOSE SUBJECT MATTERS ARE CLOSELY RELATED AS FOR EXAMPLE TWO OR MORE COURSES IN PHYSICAL SCIENCE OR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCE OR AGRICULTURE OR LANGUAGE AN ALLIED GROUP OF HIGHSCHOOL SUBJECTS SUGGESTS SUCH LARGER COMBINATIONS OFTEN HELPFUL IN ADMINISTRATION OF GROUP REQUIRE MENTS MAJORS AND MINORS AND AS A GUIDE IN THE ASSIGNMENT OF WORK TO TEACHERS AS THE SCIENCES THE HUMANITIES THE FINE ARTS AND THE PRACTICAL ARTS A SEQUENTIAL GROUP OF COURSES REFERS TO COURSES IN A GIVEN HIGHSCHOOL SUBJECT OR IN CLOSELY RELATED HIGHSCHOOL SUBJECTS WHICH ARE PLANNED FOR CERTAIN PUPIL GROUPS WHO ARE TO CONTINUE ELECTING COURSES WITHIN THIS GROUP THROUGH SEVERAL DIFFERENT SCHOOL YEARS THESE COURSES ARE SO ADMINISTERED AND TAUGHT THAT BECAUSE OF THE LOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS GRADED DIFFICULTY AND PARTIAL CURRICULUM PURPOSE EACH COURSE IMPLIES THE NEXT CREDITS FOR ANY IN THE GROUP OFTEN BEING CONTINGENT UPON COMPLETION OF THE GROUP A HIGHSCHOOL COURSE MEANS SIMPLY THE QUANTITY KIND AND ORGANIZATION OF SUBJECTMATTER IN ANY HIGHSCHOOL SUBJECT OFFERED WITHIN A DEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME FOR WHICH A CREDIT UNIT OR A FRACTION OF A CREDIT UNIT TOWARD GRADUATION IS GRANTED AS SECONDYEAR LATIN OR FIRSTYEAR ALGEBRA IT IS CLEAR THAT PRACTICALLY ANY SUPERVISION OF THE PUPILS CHOICE OF STUDIES IMPLIES SOME KIND OF CURRICULUM PHILOSOPHY AND SOME CORRESPONDING ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICE THE PREVAILING PRACTICES MAY BE DISTINGUISHED ROUGHLY AS FOLLOWS FIRST THE ELECTIVE SYSTEM WHICH IS A PLAN OF ADMINISTERING THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS AND COURSES WHEREBY EACH PUPIL MAY RECEIVE 584CURRICULUM ADJUSTMENTS IN HIGH SCHOOLS INDIVIDUALLY FROM THE PRINCIPAL OR SOME TEACHER DESIGNATED BY HIM IF AT ALL GUIDANCE IN HIS SELECTION OF COURSES BUT MAY NOT BE RESTRICTED BY ANY UNIFORM STANDARD IN THIS SELECTION SECOND IS THE GROUP SYSTEM WHICH IS A PLAN OF ADMINISTER ING PUPILS CHOICES OF SUBJECTS AND COURSES WHICH PLACES RESTRICTIONS UPON THESE ELECTIONS OF COURSES GENERALLY MAKING SELECTIONS CON TINGENT UPON THE REMAINDER OF THE WORK PLANNED FOR THE GIVEN SCHOOL YEAR OR OTHER YEARS THESE PRESCRIPTIONS BEING POINTED OUT IN THE SCHEDULE OF CLASSES OR OTHERWISE BY SOME SYSTEM OF ADVICE AND GUIDANCE MADE CLEAR TO THE STUDENTS AS WITH THE ELECTIVE SYSTEM THE GROUP SYSTEM ALLOWS FOR INDIVIDUAL COMBINATION COURSES THIRDLY WE HAVE THE SYSTEM ADVOCATED IN THIS PAPER THE CURRICULUM SYSTEM THIS SYSTEM IMPLIES THE ORGANIZATION OF COURSES INTO DISTINCTIVE CURRICULUMS DEFINITELY PLANNED WITH REFER ENCE NOT TO EACH INDIVIDUAL PUPILS PERSONAL NEEDS PRIMARILY BUT WITH REFERENCE TO THE DIFFERENT EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF SPECIAL GROUPS OF PUPILSCURRICULUMS BASED UPON SOCIAL RATHER THAN UPON NECESSARILY VAGUE PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS THIS SYSTEM EM PHASIZES CHIEFLY THE ELECTION OF CURRICULUMS ONLY ALLOWING SOME LEEWAY WITHIN EACH CURRICULUM BUT ALLOWING LITTLE FREEDOM FOR INDIVIDUAL AND CAPRICIOUS CHOICE OF STUDIES BELONGING TO OTHER CURRICULUMS THAN THE ONE TO WHICH THE PUPIL HAS BEEN ASSIGNED THE ASSIGNMENT IMPLIES THE BEST COMBINED JUDGMENT OF PARENT PUPIL AND SCHOOL ADVISER IN THE FIRST PLACE THE FIRST PLAN IS BETTER IN THEORY THAN IT HAS PROVED TO BE IN PRACTICE PRESIDENT ELIOT ITS POWERFUL AND PLAUSIBLE PROPONENT PROBABLY ALWAYS ACTUALLY MEANT BY IT A SORT OF ADMINISTRATIVE IDEALISM ALWAYS MODIFIABLE IN ACTUAL EXIGENCIES OF PRACTICE AS A THEORY OF INDIVIDUALISM IN EDUCATION IT IS EXCELLENT BUT AS A PLAN OF DAILY ADMINISTRATION IT HAS BEEN FORSAKEN BY PRACTICALLY ALL COLLEGES EVEN LIBERALARTS DEPARTMENTS SPEAKING FOR THE PRESENT COSMOPOLITAN HIGH SCHOOL IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT IT IS MORE LIKE THE UNIVERSITY IN TYPE OF ORGANIZATION THAN IT IS LIKE THE COLLEGE OF ARTS IN THE UNIVERSITY ORGANIZATION ALL CURRICULUMS OF INSTRUCTION EXCEPT THAT OF THE ARTS COLLEGE ARE RIGIDLY PRESCRIBED CURRICULUMS FOR THE MOST PART THE REASON IS THAT THEY ARE DEFINITELY DESIGNED FOR TRAINING FOR A PARTICULAR KIND OF WORK THE HIGH SCHOOL HAS 585THE SCHOOL REVIEW ITS COLLEGEOFARTS FEATURE ALSO AND AS FELTER ABOVE SAYS IT MUST RETAIN THIS AND DEVELOP IT IT MUST HOWEVER HAVE OTHER GENUINE CURRICULUMS AND THESE OTHERSTHE VARIOUS TYPES ON THE SAME GENERAL PATTERN FOR THE TRADES AND CRAFTS THE COMMERCIAL DIFFERENTIATED TOO INTO THE CLERICAL AND THE BUSINESSTRANSACTION TYPES AND OTHERS THE AGRICULTURAL THE DOMESTIC AND THE TEACHER TRAININGMUST EACH BE VERY DEFINITE IN FUNCTION JUST AS THE ENGI NEERING OR THE LAW OR THE MEDICAL UNIVERSITY CURRICULUM IS DEFINITE HERE WILL BE NECESSARY MUCH PRESCRIPTION OF STUDIES BOTH IN THE MATTER OF ALLIED GROUPS AND SEQUENTIAL GROUPS OF COURSES THERE MUST WITHIN CURRICULUMS BE SOME LEEWAY FOR THE INDIVIDUAL PUPILS AND EVEN POSSIBILITIES OF TRANSFER FROM ONE TO ANOTHER CURRICULUM THE GREAT OCCASION FOR CHOICE HOWEVER AND THE GREAT SCHOOL OPPORTUNITY FOR INDIVIDUAL DIAGNOSIS AND EDUCATIONAL AND VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE MUST BE THAT OF GETTING PUPILS INTO THE RIGHT CURRICULUM IT IS THE EXIGENCY OF THE PRESENT CONDITION OF SOCIETY THAT HIGH SCHOOLS MUST BE ADMINISTERED WITH THIS REFERENCE TO THE ACTUAL SOCIAL AND VOCATIONAL DEMANDS MADE UPON CONSIDERABLE GROUPS OF THOSE ENROLLED THE PRAGMATIC EDUCATIONAL IDEAL SO FAR AS A SCHEME OF INSTRUCTION IS CONCERNED IS NEITHER TO ADMINISTER ONE CLASSIC AND RESPECTABLE ACADEMIC CURRICULUM NOR ON AN ELECTIVE BASIS PRETEND TO ADJUST INSTRUCTION BY MERELY MANIPULATING INDIVIDUAL COMBINATIONS OF COURSES TO THE SUPPOSED NEEDS OF EACH PUPIL I KNOW A HIGHSCHOOL PRINCIPAL WHO SPENDS EIGHT WEEKS OF HIS PRECIOUS SCHOOL YEAR IN THUS ADVISING INDIVIDUAL PUPILS WHILE ALL HIS OTHER DUTIES ARE SIMPLY NOT DONE AT ALL HE DOES IT FROM A SENSE OF DUTY AND THINKS THAT THIS SHUFFLING OF ISOLATED COURSES WILL SOMEHOW WORK WONDERS FOR EACH OF HIS OVER 800 ADVISEES THIS IS A PREVALENT EDUCATIONAL SUPERSTITION SUPERINTENDENT SPAULDING HAS THIS TO SAY IN THE REPORT OF THE PORTLAND SURVEY P 165 BY SELECTING AND COMBINING IN VARYING PROPORTIONS FROM THESE REGULAR STANDARD HIGHSCHOOL SUBJECTS AN INDEFINITE NUMBER OF COURSES CURRICULUMS MAY BE MADE AS THE PRESENT SOCALLED ENGLISH LATIN GERMAN SCIENTIFIC AND COLLEGE PREPARATORY COURSES HAVE BEEN MADE THE MAKING OF SUCH COURSES SHOULD BE LARGELY INDIVIDUAL AND DETERMINED MERELY BY CON VENIENCE THEY SHOULD AID AND NOT HINDER THE ADAPTATION OF WORK 586CURRICULUM ADJUSTMENTS IN HIGH SCHOOLS TO THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF EVERY PUPIL IN PRACTICE THERE MUST BE AS MANY COURSES CURRICULUMS AS THERE ARE PUPILS HE ADDS THAT IDENTITY OF COURSES CURRICULUMS SHOULD NEVER BE A PRIMARY FACT TO WHICH PUPILS MUST ADJUST THEMSELVES I BELIEVE THIS STATEMENT IS SERIOUSLY MISLEADING AS IT STANDS FOR IT SEEMS TO MAKE MR SPAULDING SAY THAT WE MUST ADMINISTER HIGH SCHOOLS ON THE BASIS OF 883 CURRICULUMS FOR 883 HIGHSCHOOL PUPILS IN THE SCHOOL CITED ABOVE RATHER THAN UPON THE HARD FACT THAT THERE ARE FOR ANY GIVEN HIGH SCHOOL LEGITIMATELY ONLY A RESTRICTED NUMBER OF REAL AND EFFECTIVE CURRICULUMS WHICH CAN BE ADMINISTERED MOREOVER THIS IS IN DIRECT OPPOSITION TO THE ACTUAL PLAN OF ORGANI ZATION OF INSTRUCTION MR SPAULDING SO EFFECTIVELY DIRECTS AND SO BRILLIANTLY DEFENDS FOR HIS SYSTEM OF HIGH SCHOOLS OF NEWTON MASSA CHUSETTS INSTEAD OF THIS VAGUE POLICY OF FITTING EXCEPT WITHIN CURRICULUMS AND FOR EXCEPTIONAL CASES FOR EVERY INDIVIDUAL WITH REFERENCE TO HIS INDIVIDUALITY MR SPAULDING DOES SEEM TO HAVE FOUND THE NATURAL GROUPINGS OF HIS PUPILS SO FAR AS VOCATIONAL NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS ARE CONCERNED AND TO HAVE PROVIDED FOR THEM THE DISTINCTIVE CURRICULUMS ABOVE ADVOCATED ON GENERAL PRINCIPLES FOR ALL HIGH SCHOOLS THAT CAN ADMINISTER MORE THAN ONE FROM HIS 1913 ANNUAL REPORT WE LEARN THAT THERE ARE IN HIS CITY THREE SEPA RATELY ORGANIZED HIGHSCHOOL DEPARTMENTS IN TWO HIGHSCHOOL BUILD INGS BY THESE THREE DEPARTMENTS ARE OFFERED FOURTEEN DISTINCT CURRICULUMS AS WE HAVE DEFINED CURRICULUMS THE ENROLMENTS ARE AS FOLLOWS FOR THESE FOURTEEN CURRICULUMS CLASSICAL 52I SCIENTIFIC I21 GENERAL I75 TECHNOLOGYCOLLEGE I58 TECHNICAL I3 FINE ARTS 50 BUSINESS I27 CLERICAL 347 MACHINE SHOP 65 CABINET MAKING 30 PRINTING 35 PATTERNMAKING I8 HOUSEHOLD 21 ELECTRICAL 53 EACH CURRICULUM IS ADMIRABLY DESIGNED AND CLEARLY DEFINED AS TO SPECIFIC PURPOSE INDEED THE NEWTON SYSTEM OF HIGHSCHOOL DEPARTMENTS WITH THEIR DISTINCTIVE CURRICULUMS IS ORGANIZED ON THE MOST MODERN BASIS OF CURRICULUM BUILDING SUCH AN ORGANIZATION OF CURRICULUMS AUTOMATICALLY RESTRICTS VICIOUS HABITS OF ELECTION BY STUDENTS OBVIOUSLY THE HIGHSCHOOL ORGANIZATION OF FAVORED NEWTON CANNOT BE AND SHOULD NOT BE LARGELY COPIED CURRICULUM BUILDING IS LARGELY ADAPTATION TO COMMUNITY NEEDS AND DEMANDS AND IS 587THE SCHOOL REVIETV WHOLLY ADAPTATION TO THE LEGITIMATE DEMANDS OF THE DOMINANT GROUPS OF ITS PUPIL BODY THE SMALL HIGH SCHOOL HAS STILL OTHER SORTS OF LIMITATIONS HOW THE SMALL HIGH SCHOOL CAN DO MORE THAN LITERALLY PREPARE FOR LITERAL COLLEGEENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED BY SNEDDEN IN HIS EDUCATIONAL READJUSTMENT CHAP VII THE GENERAL REMEDY IS TO PLAN THE FIRST TWO YEARS WITHOUT REFERENCE TO COLLEGE EXPECTATIONS AND COMPROMISE ON THE LAST TWO BY THE NECESSARY CONFORMITY THE RECENT SPRINGFIELD SURVEY CALLS ATTEN TION TO THE FACT THAT MOST OF THE CHILDREN STAY ONLY ONE OR TWO YEARS IN HIGH SCHOOL BUT THAT THE ENTIRE WORK OF THE SCHOOL IS PLANNED AS THOUGH ALL THE CHILDREN WHO ENTERED REMAINED FOR THE ENTIRE FOURYEAR COURSE THE REPORT CONTINUES THIS PROCEDURE IS NOT ECONOMICAL IF MOST OF THE WORK OF THE HIGH SCHOOL IS TO BE DEVOTED TO TEACHING CHILDREN WHO REMAIN ONLY ONE OR TWO YEARS IT SHOULD BE PLANNED WITH THAT END IN VIEW AND ON THE OTHER HAND IF ALL OF THE WORK IS TO BE PLANNED AS PART OF A FOURYEAR COURSE CURRICULUM THEN EVERY EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE TO RETAIN THE CHILDREN FOR THE FOUR YEARS ADD TO THIS THE COMMENT OF SNEDDEN THAT PROBABLY THE GREAT PORTION OF THESE WHO DROP OUT SHOULD GO NO FARTHER THAN THE TENTH GRADE AND WE HAVE A CLEANCUT CURRICULUM PROBLEM FOR THE SMALL HIGH SCHOOL TO WORK OUTOR FOR THE LARGER HIGH SCHOOL OF THE TRADITIONAL TYPE THE VERMONT SURVEYS SUGGESTION THAT THE JUNIOR TYPE OF HIGH SCHOOL BE MULTIPLIED AND STANDARDIZED TOGETHER WITH THE NUMEROUS EXPERIMENTS GOING ON IN THIS DIRECTION IN ALMOST EVERY STATE WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE A WIDESPREAD RECOGNITION OF THIS ISSUE AMONG OTHER THINGS THE ILLINOIS STATE SCHOOL SURVEY NOW UNDER WAY IS ATTEMPTING TO SECURE DATA WHICH MAY SERVE AS A BASIS FOR DETERMINING FOR WHICH OF THE FOLLOWING OCCUPATIONS THE PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL MAY IN THE NEAR FUTURE BE EXPECTED TO OFFER SOME DEFINITE TRAINING HOUSEWIVES HOUSEHOLD SERVANTS DRESSMAKERS SEAM STRESSES RETAIL MERCHANTS CLERKS SALESMEN SALESWOMEN CARPENTERS DELIVERY BOYS STEAMRAILROAD MEN MACHINISTS PAINTERS BOOK KEEPERS WAITERS ENGINEERS STATIONARY CHAUFFEURS PRINTERS BLACKSMITHS MASONS BARBERS MESSENGER BOYS PLUMBERS STREET RAILROAD MEN TELEPHONE OPERATORS TELEGRAPHERS IRONWORKERS TAILORS TEACHERS RURAL SCHOOL LAUNDRESSES NURSES FACTORY GIRLS 588CURRICULUM ADJUSTMENTS IN HIGH SCHOOLS THE SCHOOL MENS CONVICTIONS IN REGARD TO THE HIGH SCHOOLS FUTURE ROLE IN PREPARATION FOR MANY OF THESE OCCUPATIONS IS SURPRISING AND SIGNIFICANT IN ADDITION TO THIS PERCENTAGE GROUPINGS OF THE ENTIRE HIGHSCHOOL PUPIL POPULATION AS IT RUNS FROM YEAR TO YEAR WITH REFERENCE TO REASONABLE VOCATIONAL EXPECTATIONS ARE BEING MADE BY SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS FOR ALL THE HIGH SCHOOLS OF THE STATE THE FOLLOWING ARE THE SEVENTEEN GROUPS INTO WHICH THESE PUPILS ARE BEING CLASSIFIED WITH THE HOPE THAT OUT OF THIS NECESSARILY ROUGH ANALYSIS MAY ISSUE SOME CLUES AS TO LOCAL CURRICULUM NEEDS OF THE DIFFERENTLY CLASSED AND DIFFERENTLY CONSTITUTED CITIES TOWNS AND DISTRICTS I LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGES 2 ENGINEERING SCHOOLS 3 AGRICULTURAL COLLEGES 4 OTHER HIGHER PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE DENTISTRY FORESTRY BUSINESS ETC 5 NORMAL SCHOOLS 6 RURAL SCHOOL TEACHING 7 FARMERS OR DAIRYMEN 8 HOMEMAKERS

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

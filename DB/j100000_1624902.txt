in vital statistics illustrated by a comparison of the Walloon and Flemish inhabitants of Bel gium The facts presented are interesting and from the best obtainable sources but the complexity of the problem is enormous and after one has excluded all other possi ble or probable explanations for the diver sity discovered very little is left which can be strictly called ethnic For instance the birth rates the excess of male infants and the infant mortality may have quite other explanations than those connected with eth nic contrasts BUDDHALIKE FIGURES IN AMERICA AND ELSEWHERE IN Egypt in Greece and abundantly in France representations of deities seated crosslegged have been found and fre quently by archaeologists have been referred to as Buddhistic or Buddhalike figures In the museum of the Trocadero Paris there are a number of such in terra cotta from Chiapas and at Palenque the cross legged divinity has been pictured by Stephens Travels vol II p 318 and others Of course these have been utilized as evidence of Buddhistic influence in North America and Europe A severe blow at such illusions is dealt by M H Galiment in the Revue de lEcole dAnthropologie Feb 15 in an article on the oriental attitude of divinities By this he means merely the ordinary oriental method of sitting which is common also to our tailors and to many nonoriental na tions This he sharply distinguishes from the religious attitude assigned to the Bud dhas In the latter the legs are crossed and each foot rests on the thigh of the opposite leg with the sole turned upward and in full view This is quite different from the atti tude in any of the American specimens known to me either by observation or by copies They are seated with the legs crossed beneath the thighs in the ordinary sartorial position Thus does another prop fall from the weak structure of the builders of American aboriginal culture on Asiatic foundations CURRENT NOTES ON METEOROLOGY HURRICANES IN JAMAICA A CHRONOLOGICAL list of hurricanes earthquakes and other physical occur rences noted in Jamaica between 1504 and 1880 is given by Maxwell Hall in Vol II of the Jamaica Mieteorological Observations 1896 The first great hurricane experi enced by the English in Jamaica was on August 28 1712 and on August 28 1722 another very violent one occurred which resulted in the loss of about 400 lives and the wrecking of fortyfour vessels in the harbor of Port Royal In order that these two visitations might be remembered by the inhabitants August 28th was appointed to be kept as a perpetual fast by the Act 9 Geo I ch I passed in 1722 On June 3 1770 there was a smart shock of earthquake which was immediately preceded at Cape Francois by a fall of 25 in in the water barometer corresponding to a fall of 02 in in the mercurial barometer Small oscilla tions of this character have since been noticed at Kingston as accompanying earthquake shocks Previous to the hurricane of October 3 1770 a noise resembling the roar of distant thunder was heard to issue from the bot tom of all the wells in the neighborhood of Kingston twenty hours before the com mencement of the storm A ship captain who noted this fact and who was informed that it was a prognostic of an approaching hurricane managed to get his ship into the inner harbor in time to save her from de struction 768 SCIENCEMAY 22 1896 SCIE1 THE CLIMATE OF VENEZUELA SOME notes on the Venezuelan climate are quite in place at the present time Three climatic zones are recognized The tierra caliente extending from sea level to about 1800 feet with a mean temperature of 77 to 86 F the tierra templada reaching up to about 7200 feet with a mean tem perature of 60 to 77 F and the tierra fria above 7200 feet with a mean temperature below 60 F The heat on the northern coast is excessive owing to the trade wind which blows on shore there after crossing the hot Caribbean Sea Maracaibo which has the reputation of being the hottest place in the world is on this northern coast while Caracas at an elevation of 3000 feet above sea level is in the tierra templada and enjoys a cooler and more agreeable climate The maximum temperature is between 68 and 82 in the hot months and 52 and 710 in the cool months In Acarigua south of the Portuguesa range a temperature of 1255 has been reached in the sun and 895 in the shade The climate is as a whole healthy Yellow fever prevails near the coast and in the Llanos and forests of the lowlands and sometimes visits towns in the tierra templada The higher moun tains are free from it and have a very healthy climate The foregoing facts are taken from a paper on Venezuela in the Scottish Geographical Magaczine for April 1896 A QUICK VOYAGE ACROSS THE PACIFIC THE May Pilot Chart of the North Pacific Ocean contains mention of a remarkable passage recently made from Shanghai to Port Townsend by the American schooner Aida the time from port to port being only 27 days During the greater part of the voyage the wind was between north and west and on three days blew with the force of a whole gale The Aida started YCE 769 in the western half of a cyclonic depression central over Japan and hence experienced northwesterly winds for several days These were followed by southerly winds of considerable force due to the approach from the west of another cyclonic storm The last few days she had southwesterly winds from an anticyclone central in Lat 40 N Long 135 W this high pressure area diverting the preceding cyclone to the northward and thus preventing the Aida from experiencing the northwest gales on its rear This passage of the Aida  may be regarded as an excellent example of what may be accomplished by a wellfound sailing vessel whose master makes the most of the meteorological conditions prevailing over the ocean and of the information now available concerning them A TORNADO IN NEW JERSEY TORNADOES are of such infrequent oc currence in the eastern United States that accounts of them when they do occur are of special interest On July 13 1895 a distinct tornado developed near Cherry Hill N J causing the death of three per sons injuring about twenty others and en tailing a loss to property livestock etc of about 60000 6th Annual Report New Jersey weather service 1895 203208 It appears that while the general character istics of tornado action were present such as the funnel cloud the whirling the roar and the thunderstorm the usual atmos pheric conditions which precede such storms were lacking A number of curious tricks were performed by the tornado after the usual fashion of these disturbances In the Dutch Reformed Church whose sides and windows were punctured with holes a large beam was found lying across the pews it having been blown there from out side A splinter of wood 15 inches long 2 inches square at one end and tapering to a point at the other was found firmly stuckN S VOL III No 73 into a fence post A number of excellent photographic views

delivered by the Public Printer It is a handsome volume of 755 pages and 48 plates and contains be sides the administrative reports of the Director himself and of chiefs in charge of work the fol lowing special papers Preliminary Report on the Geology of the Common Roads of the United States by Prof N S Shaler The Potomac Formation by Prof L F Ward Sketch of the Geology of the San Francisco Peninsula by Andrew C Lawson  Preliminary Report on the Marquette Ironbearing District of Michigan by Prof C R Van Hise W S Bayley and H L Smyth and The Origin and Relation of Central Mary land Granites by C R Keyes with an In troduction on the General Relations of the Granitic Rocks in the Middle Atlantic Pied mont Plateau by the late Prof G H Wil liams From these titles it is evident that the paper of most popular interest is the first one on roads by the versatile Harvard professor He treats of the history of American roads the methods of using stone in roadbuilding the relative value of road stones their distribution sources of supply etc and thus makes a timely contribution to a subject which is re ceiving special attention in all parts of the country This is the last report made by Major J W Powell as Director of the Survey who until re cently has had charge of the work under dif ferent organizations for twentyfive years FISH CULTURE IN a lecture on fish culture before the Royal Institution of Great Britain Mr J J Armi stead of the Royal Commission on Tweed and Solway Fisheries thus compares the methods used in Great Britain and the United States The hatching apparatus which is now chiefly used in England consists of a long box the water flowing in at one end protected by a water board or break water which is simply to break the current and prevent it from washing away the eggs which are placed in the box It also diverts the current and sends it down to the bottom of the box The water pas ses underneath and passes out at a higher level where we have a screen of perforated metal to prevent the escape of the little fish and in this box is placed the hatching ap paratus proper that is the trays or grilles upon which the ova are deposited The grilles now in use are made of glass We found after try ing a variety of substances that glass is the best of anything It gives off nothing Wood and metal we know corrode in water and in some waters some metals corrode very much and a great deal of loss has been suffered by some who have used metallic trays for the pur poses of incubation The Americans like to do things as we know on a wholesale scale and not content with putting a layer of eggs upon the apparatus they fill a basket as they call it half full of eggs Then they send a current of water welling up from underneath and of course the effect is that it flows through amongst the eggs and they find that in due time they hatch I have made very careful in quiries with regard to the result of the hatching of ova in this way and I have found that the Americans are quite prepared to admit that they had a larger percentage of mortality in their metal baskets or trays than they had when they used glass grilles They said  We have dis carded glass grilles long ago They are too expensive And they made use of other ex cuses But however we find in practice that we can get far better results from these glass grilles because as I have said there is nothing to contaminate the ova or do them injury The trout eggs absorb any metallic matter which may be in the water and become so saturated with it in course of time as to be very seriously in jured They may not be absolutely killed at the time but it has been found that although there is only a slightly increased mortality in hatching upon the metal there is a greater mortality amongst the fish afterwards They 770 SCIENCE

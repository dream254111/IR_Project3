because a contract relation exists between the corporations and the state which is impaired 2 because it deprives the corporations of a right under the Constitution of the United States and the Acts of Congress Chicago R I  P Ry Co v Swanger I908  C C W D Mo  157 Fed Rep 783 In regard to state statutes which require as a condition precedent to the right of a foreign corporation to do business in the state a stipulation that the right of removal will not be exercised the law is well settled that such a statute and such a stipulation is void Home Ins Co v Morse 20 Wall 445 22 L Ed 365 Barrow v

of a license to dlo business under a statute such as the one in the principal case making it the duty of the Secretary of State to revoke the license if the foreign corporation removes a case to the federal court Doyle v Continental Ins Co 94 U S 535 24 L Ed 148 Security Ins Co v Prewitt 202 U S 246 26 Sup Ct 619 State v Doyle 40 Wis 175 22 Am Rep 692 But see Cor v East Tenn Coal Co 97 Ky 238 30 S W 608 While the principal case would seem to fall squarely within the principle enunciated in the Doyle case it has this important difference upoA which the judge relies The Doyle case applies to an insurance corporation and the principal case to a railroad corporation which has made valuable investments in Missouri and has vested property rights The Court in the principal case says that thereby a contract rela tion has arisen between the State and the foreign railroad corporation which is impaired by the Statute The contract and property rights involved dis tinguish it from the Doyle case The distinction seems a strong and reason able one and it is to be hoped the case will be taken to the Supreme Court for final settlement The tendency to find a contract relation between a state and foreign corporations is growing Am Smelting Co v Colorado 204 U S 103 27 Sup Ct I98 5i L Ed 393 Seaboard Air Line Ry Co v Commis sion 155 Fed 792 6 MICH LAW REV 258 See further on statutes restricting

petitioned for mand amus to compel the Secretary of State to take the necessary steps to submit to the people at the next November elections the revised Constitution as provided by the Constitutional Convention The respondent denied the power of the Convention to fix a date other than that provided by the Legislature which had provided that the Constitutionshould be submitted at the April election Held that the writ should issue HOOKER MCALVAY 588RECENT IMPORTANT DECISIONS and MONTGOMERY JJ dissent Carton President of Constitutional Con vention v Secretary of State Igo8  Mich  14 Det Leg News 968 115 N W Rep 429 There were six opinions submitted in this case and three general points of difference are announced in them GRANT C J supported in part by BLAIR J maintains the right of the convention to fix the date of the submission to the people on the ground that a constitutional convention is a sovereign body Great diversity prevails among the courts and textwriters as to the status of a constitutional convention One group maintains that such a convention is a sovereign body accountable only to the people that created it Loomis v Jackson 6 W Va 613 Sproule v Fredericks 69 Miss 898 Franz v Autrey 9I Pac Okla I93 The other that the constitutional convention is a mere committee created by the people and possessing only such powers as are expressly or by necessary implication delegated to it Under this theory it is in general the right and duty of a legislature to prescribe when where and how a convention shall meet and proceed with its business and put its work in operation JAMESON CONST CONVEN TIONS 4th ed  380 Woods Appeal 75 Pa St 59 For further discussion see note 6 MICH LAW REV 70 The other justices while denying the sov ereignty theory of the convention differ on a matter of construction of certain terms in the existing constitution of Michigan The minority of the courE hold that no provision is made in the existing constitution for the time of submitting a revision to the people and so conclude that it was left to the legislature to determine The majority of the court however hold that the provision in the existing constitution that amendments shall be sub mitted at the next general election applies to a revision of the constitution The next general election means the November elections and not those occurring in theSpring Westinghausen v People 44 Mich 265 Therefore as the existing constitution provides that the revision shall be submitted at the next general election the legislature does not possess the power to change the date CRIMINAL LAWCAPITAL OFFENSEBAILWHEN GRANTEDThe peti tioners were charged with murder Upon their preliminary examination bail was refused and they were confined in jail to await trial Thereupon they sued out a writ of habeas corpus alleging that they were illegally confined in that the proof of guilt was not evident nor the presumption thereof great Held that if after hearing the whole evidence introduced on the application for bail it is insufficient to generate in the mind of the court a reasonable doubt whether the accused committed the act charged and in doing so they were guilty of a capital offense bail should be refused In re Thomas et al I908  Okla  93 Pac Rep 980 The constitutions of most states contain substantially the same provision respecting bail that is found in  17 art 2 of the Bill of Rights of Okla homa towit All persons shall be bailable by sufficient sureties except for capital offenses when the proof of guilt is evident or the presumption thereof is great In consequence courts of many states have been called 589

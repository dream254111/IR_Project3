Professor of Political Economy Johns Hopkins University and former Treasurer of Porto Rico and Confidential Agent of the United States to San Domingo The growth of the debt of San Domingo has an intricate and involved history If however attention be turned from the mass of complex details to the underlying forces which have reduced the republic to its condition of sodden bankruptcy the whole matter becomes astonishingly simple As it now exists the debt of San Domingo is essentially the result of three elements viz The periodic accumulation of cur rent obligations in consequence of revolutionary disturbances and civil disorders 2 the extravagant terms upon which such tempo rary loans have originally been obtained and have been subsequently funded 3 the chronic default in the service of the debt funded and floating and the consequent rapid increase of principal It is possible to point out certain other occasions which have given rise to the contraction of indebtedness such as the construc tion of the Puerto Plata Santiago Railroad the erection of a few wharves and public buildings the purchase of two unimportant gunboats and the settlement of indemnity claims but all things considered the number of these is few and their aggregate impor tance is relatively slight In the three occasions for debt accumula tion enumerated aboveto a further consideration of which atten tion is now invitedthe history of the Dominican debt is essentially comprised It is an obvious commonplace to speak of political instability as the keynote of the financial collapse of San Domingo But this is after all the alpha and omega of the situation In the brief intervals during which the country was not threatened by or actually in the throes of revolution a disproportionate part of the public revenues were applied to the purchase of war supplies and the maintenance of a ragtag soldiery leaving other parts of the budget to accumulate in default At other times the amounts so expended 93The Annals of the American Academy virtually absorbed all available funds Thus in the fiscal years I903 and I904 military and naval expenditures formed 717 and 726 per cent respectively of the republics ordinary disbursements It should be clearly understood at the outset that a Dominican revolution bears as little resemblance to what the American mind understands by the term as do the Dominican generals who figure therein correspond to the similarly named officers of our own mili tary establishment It is not in any sense a popular uprising wherein a mass of people inspired by love of country or liberty seek tooverthrow or reconstruct an existing government The phrases patria and libertad figure abundantly in the pronuncia mientos of every insurrectionist leader but their significance is absolutely nothing more than as rhetorical expletives and claptrap equipment A Dominican revolution might be briefly defined as the attempt of a bandit guerrilla to seize a custom house In the background acting as a moving force will ordinarily be found a political malcontent ambitious to overthrow the dictator president in power and to succeed in control to his own profit But the custom house and the insurgent chief are the real keys to the situation San Domingo while nominally a republic is even in constitu tional form a highly decentralized government For administrative purposes the country is divided into twelve provinces each under a governor appointed by the president of the republic Each governor is in command of the detachment of the national army stationed in that province and is also the head of a district provincial and sometimes indeed of a municipal police Theoretically the provin cial administrations are organic parts of the central government As a matter of fact in consequence of the weakness of the central government and the difficulty of communication between the several parts of the country each province has tended to become a virtually independent semifeudal principality Appropriations for the ex penses of the province are made nominally in the national budget but as a result of the chronic depletion of the national treasury and the almost entire dependence upon customs receipts the expenses of the province were paid directly out of the proceeds of the custom houses located therein or adjacent thereto Thus the custom house of Monte Cristi paid the expenses of the Province of Monte Cristi that of Puerto Plata the expenses of Puerto Plata Santiago and 94The Financial Difficulties of San Domingo Moca that of Samana the expenses of Samana except the commune of Sanchez that of Sanchez the expenses of La Vega and Pacifi cador and the commune of Sanchez that of Macoris the expenses of Macoris and Seybo that of Santo Domingo city the expenses of Santo Domingo and the deficits in Azua and Barahona the receipts from whose respective custom houses were ordinarily insufficient The strategic importance of a custom house in Dominican politics can now be better appreciated So long as this prime source of public revenue continued in the hands of constituted authorities everything remained tranquil the soldiers received their pay the civil officials collected their salaries and the governor garnered his perquisites But the situation changed magically the moment con trol was lost of the custom house and the allimportant source of public revenue cut off The governor if he were not already active in the insurrectionist cause either fled in defeat or awaited over tures the army deserted to a man to the new standard and the civil service retired to cacao farming to wait until a new turn of the political whirligig invited emergence The natural history of a Dominican revolution was therefore something as follows The machinery of the existing government after running smoothly for a while had begun to creak in conse quence of clamorous creditors disappointed officeseekers and per sonal grievances Some political parasite or chronic malcontent perhaps the lastousted dictatorpresident of the republictook the initiative Occasionally from his own private resources much oftener through the speculative venture of a merchant lender he secured money or credit a part of which was immediately expended in the purchase and secret landing of fighting supplies The par ticular provinceif more than one so much the betterwhere in consequence of remoteness or personal unpopularity dissatisfaction against the government seemed most likely became the scene of conspiracy If the governor of the province could be won over by promise or price the revolution was forthwith an accomplished fact If he remained unshaken in his loyalty the services were bought of one or more desperado chieftainstechnically described as gen erals or if more modest as chiefswith feudallike bands of followers attached to whom this guerrilla service was as regular a business as cacao or plantain cultivation was to the bulk of the 95The Anntals of the Americant Academy population A period of fighting followed the issue of which was determined by the seizure of the custom house If the custom house could not be taken the insurrectionist army melted away by desertion the funds on hand were exhausted and no further ad vances could be obtained The general with a handful of devoted followers escaped to the mountains to carry on a desultory fight until he was induced by guarantee of personal safety and a grant of an asignacion to lay down his arms and come in If on the other hand the custom house could be captured and held by the insurrectionists the pockets of the bandit leaders were promptly filled by advances from local merchants until the fortnightly steamer arrived with its heavily dutiable cargo The revolutionist army grew in number and in loyalty and here again the revolution was well under way Now all of this was the work of a handful of men and prac tically of the same handful It is a conservative estimate to say that no more than a dozen political agitators have been at bottom responsible for the score of revolutions successful and unsuccessful which have cursed San Domingo during the past ten years and that no more than forty insurgent chiefs have executed them Indeed the entire initial strength of a successful insurgent force was never more than a hundred ragamuffins They prevailed even to the extent of overthrowing the existing government exactly in the same way that a brace of train robbers can in broad daylight hold up a whole company or a few desperadoes can raid an entire town The people of San Domingo were the victims not the constitu ents of such revolutions The average Dominican and especially he of the countryside is a quiet peaceloving lawabiding mod erately hardworking peasant In many particulars he is a typical West Indian with his petty vices of cockfighting and rum drinking inclining to be married but not parsoned living in a rough shack rearing a numerous progeny owning a few cattle pigs and chickens cultivating a little patch of communalowned land planted in cacao tobacco or plantain and working no harder than he does because a too bounteous nature has made it unnecessary for him to do so He is hospitable and wellintentioned and under ordinary conditions it is safer for a traveler to ride by day or night alone and 96The Finailcial Difficulties of San Domingo unarmed through even the most remote parts of the country than it would be for him in many rural districts of the United States The Dominican is superior physically to the ordinary West Indian peon for his country is richer and his relative numbers are fewer Underfeeding and anemia have not devitalized him and he possesses every capacity of becoming a decent and prosperous peasant That he has been prevented from becoming so in the past is because of the supreme travesty upon government under which he has been plundered and pillaged In times of peace he has been crushed by a system of taxation wherein property and incomes are exempt and the necessary consumption of the poorest classes flour beans codfish cotton cloth and illuminating oilare burdened at least Ioo per cent enhancing retail prices often to three times their normal level He groans under an annual expenditure central and local of at least two and onehalf million dollars of which the largest part has gone in salaries to the army and to professional politicians and their parasites and much of the remainder has been wasted or stolen while roads schools and public institutions have been neglected If he were wronged there was no justice to be had If he were sick or in want he suffered as the dogs of the town If he were stricken or diseased he festered by the wayside He lived under a despotism and as absolutely a malevolent one as our day and generation are likely to witness All this is in the infrequent intervals of peace When the country was threatened with insurrection or actually in the throes of revolution the condition of the ordinary Dominican became well nigh intolerable He or his sons or his laborers if he had any were likely to be drafted into the government army or kidnapped into an insurrectionist band or blackmailed by the threat of such procedure His horses cattle donkeyseven his goats and chickens would be stolen or commandeered in return for vales or evi dences of indebtedness which were as worthless to him as the stones on the ground His houses might be burned his fruit trees stripped his fields pillaged and he left prostrate and terrorized This was the visible mischief But perhaps even more important was the further indirect hurt which every succeeding Dominican revolution brought in its train from the accumulation of more debt the imposition of heavier taxes the alienation of valuable conces 97The Annals of the American Academy sions and the complete demoralization of whatever degree of the government survives With the actual appearance of serious revolutionary uprisings the whole financial machinery of the republicif a scanty handto mouth procedure can be dignified by that nameinvariably broke down and a bitter struggle for bare financial existence took its place One or more custom houses were ordinarily threatened or actually in the hands of revolutionists and the customs revenues insufficient at best became thereafter hopelessly inadequate Any thing like additional taxation at such a juncture was a device so futile as not to be entertained by even the most desperately threat ened administration Moreover the slightest delay in the payment of an already insubordinate army meant prompt desertion to the insurrectionist cause and further enlistment of men and purchase of supplies were possible only upon the basis of ready funds actually in hand To a dictatorpresident thus beset borrowing was not only the easiest but the only possible course IHis hands were never tied by constitutional procedure taking the form of a recalcitrant national congress or an articulate public sentiment Nor was his conscience troubled at the effect of such a policy upon the present wellbeing or the future resources of the country His one concern was to keep himself in control and to destroy or placate the insur rectionists Accordingly he had instant recourse to the merchant lenders of the country and with supreme indifference as to the terms of the loan or the amount and character of the securities borrowed up to the last dollar that could be coaxed or threatened It will thus be seen that this class of merchant bankers have played an important part in the history of the Dominican debt Representatives flourished and still exist in Santo Domingo city in Puerto Plata in Santiago and in every commercial center of the island ordinarily combining export and import with retail trade and gradually extending their activities to landowning and money lending Almost invariably of foreign origin and carefully main taining for greater security their foreign citizenship or some equiva lent connection this small more or less intimately associated body have in large degree influenced such limited economic development of San Domingo as has taken place and at the present time virtually control its commercial contact with the outside world 98The Financial Difficulties of San Domingo Individually considered this body of merchant lenders run the full gamut from highminded business men sensible of the coun trys resources and its legitimate opportunities seeking fairly to develop their own affairs and driven to other courses only in face of peril to person and property all the way to merciless blood sucking money sharks whose opportunity has been the countrys prostration who have exploited every crisis to the fullest who have in the hope of resultant gain sometimes provoked and cer tainly often made possible insurrection when it did not otherwise exist and who while apparently taking the gamblers chance and demanding the gamblers odds have been careful to use loaded dice and sure manipulation Upon the outbreak of a serious insurrection the ordinary procedure for the dictatorpresident in powerassuming as we safely may a depleted treasurywas to seek from his most favor ably disposed merchant lenders immediate funds to maintain his soldiery to enlist reinforcements and to secure necessary supplies For such funds he gave either vales transferable custom house receipts valid in payment of export or import dues or reconoci mientos evidences of indebtedness of treasury due bills Such securities bore interest at a specified rate per month or included in their face value the capitalized amount of such interest or most frequently of all did both A Dominican insurrection or revolution was rarely fought to a finish A certain point in the struggle once attained both parties turned instinctively to a settlement This ordinarily took the form of extending guaranties of personal safety to the insurrectionists of appointing their surviving leaders to public office of rewarding their military service by outright payments or annual pensions asignaciones and of recognizing the validity of indemnity claims for injuries fancied and real suffered at the hands of insur rectionists or of government forces If the insurrection had any validity the government weakened though triumphant showed no disposition to haggle as to the amount or terms of such obligations They related to a remote and imperfectly realized future and the troubles immediately at hand were urgent and absorbing The ship of state sailed on in serene unconcern of the mass of swollen fraudulent debt left in its wake Indeed the very cost of the insurrection as well as the expense 99Ioo The Annials of the Americani Acadelmy of suppressing or pacifying it was commonly crystallized sooner or later into a government debt The sinews of a Dominican revo lution would naturally be supplied by the merchant bankers of San Domingosometimes animated by a laudable desire to rid the country of an intolerable tyranny more often venturing the advance as a coldblooded and deliberate speculation If the insurrection were successful such advances were always recognized and a hand some return accrued to the underwriters Moreover the newly constituted government was too weak politically and financially to repudiate the obligations issued by the administration just over thrown especially if they had found their way as they ordinarily would have done into the hands of the very merchants from whom further advances must immediately be sought If the insurrection were unsuccessful the promissory papers issued by the defeated insurrectionists were carefully preserved by thrifty lenders until a new political crisis brought the unsuccessful aspirants again to the fore when all past accounts were liquidated at extravagant rates Public borrowing by a country with the unsavory past and the uncertain political future of San Domingo must under all circum stances have been expensive But the terms actually exacted and readily granted exceed all bounds either of economic risk or of prudent financiering and are as high a tribute to the rapacity of the lenders as to the mad recklessness of the borrower This is as true of the funded as of the unfunded debt As far back as I869 the government contracted in the Hartmont loan to receive 320000 in cash and to repay an annuity of 58900 for a term of twenty five years being I472500 in all In actual fact bonds to the nominal value of 757700 were emitted and only 38o95 received by the Dominican treasury In I893 the government turned over to the San Domingo Improvement Company I25oooo of 4 per cent sixtysixyear gold bondsbeing the entire issue of the fifth funded loanin consideration of the payment by the company of internal debts aggregating 438000 in gold Similarly in 1894 the sixth funded issue being I250000 4 per cent sixtysixyear bonds was delivered en bloc to the San Domingo Improvement Company in return for the extinguishment of internal debts to the amount of 538200 in gold These transactions appear even more unfavorable to the Dominican Government when it is remembered that the floating debts thus discharged were already swollen byThe Financial Difficulties of San Domingo excessive interest accumulation In I897 the FrenchBelgian bond holders consented to the conversion by the San Domingo Improve ment Company acting as the republics fiscal agents of their 4 per cent holdings into 2Y4 per cent obligations But the entire benefit that might have been expected to accrue from this operation was lost to the Dominican Government by the incomprehensible issue of an additional 6ooooo of the new securities out of which the government received a bare 50ooo 250000 in cash and the remainder of which seems to have been absorbed in defraying the expenses and commissions incident to the conversion It is however when we turn from the funded to the unfunded debt that we come full face upon a high carnival of incredible usury and scandalous overcharge that differentiates itself only by slight distinction if at all from thievery and fraud Prior to I888 we are told that the ordinary rate charged the government by the local credit companies for advances of current funds was 10 per cent a month Under more favorable conditions the rate seems to have fallen to 5 per cent a month but almost up to the present time the interest charge commonly made by mer chant lenders for advances to the government upon such reasonably safe security as transferable customs receipts has been 2 per cent a month compounded at brief intervals The rates paid for emergency loans or for advances secured only by a pledge of public credit must have been very much higher The scanty treasury records throw little light upon the real char acter of such loans and the obligations issued invariably mask the transactions by partially capitalizing the interest compensation in their face value On June 30 I897 a European firm made a contract loan of Iooooo 400000 marks to President Heureauxnominally to meet an overdue coupon upon the bonded debt but which it is claimed was never so appliedat the rate of 2 per cent a month On October I2 I903 the principal and arrears of interest of this claim amounted to 244800 In I8971899 during the closing years of President Heureauxs administration the Dominican comp trollers office or contaduria issued fortysix certificates of indebt edness in favor of Heureaux for funds alleged to have been advanced by him to the government Of these fortyone certificates of an aggregate value of I02524612 bore interest at the rate of 2 per cent a month As liquidated on March 2 I901 the interest charge I0OThe Annals of the American Academy which had throughout remained in arrears had accumulated to 66730382 and at the present time it is estimated at I71393190 These illustrations are fairly typical of the current loans of San Domingo during the entire period under consideration Such transactions can only be understood in the light of a government borrower void of every regard for the countrys present or future wellbeing and struggling desperately for mere existence to whom a public obligation was as meaningless as the value denomination which it bore and on the other hand of a series of merchant lenders sometimes bullied and threatened at other times voluntary and deliberate in the main rapacious unscrupulous and identified with the welfare of the country only as exploiters and speculators Excessive interest rates chronic default in interest payments and entire neglect of amortization must necessarily result in the rapid growth of the principal of the debt The accumulation and compounding of interest in default have figured in the nominal growth of the San Domingo debt to a degree probably not less important than the two factors already considered Unpaid creditors have taken some measure of comfort in the frequent liquidation of arrears of interest and the full recognition of the validity of all such accumulations has been the ordinary condition of further advances The entire issue of the Hartmont bonds of 1869 757000 was emitted fairly or fraudulently between 1869 and 1888 in return for an advance of 38o95 to the Dominican Government Of the principal of the 1888 loan 50922 was retained to pay current charges upon the funded debt and of the 1890 loan a further amount of 51822 for the same purpose Practically the entire principal of the three issues of FrenchAmerican reclamation consols in I893 I895 aggregating 4250000 and a further sum 277980 of the refunding 4 per cent bonds of 1897 were devoted to the discharge of current accounts in which arrears of interest figured largely Finally of the 234 per cent gold obligations of 1897 the sum of Io01750 was required for the discharge of interest in arrears of the consolidated bonds of 1893 In general it may be said that the funding of floating indebtedness and the conversion of old into new bond issues invariably involved the capitalizing of very con siderable arrears of interest The accumulation of the unfunded debt forms an even more I02The Finanlcial Difficulties of San Domingo extraordinary though unfortunately a less accessible history Certain details of this have been given in connection with what has been stated of the excessive rates of interest upon current obliga tions and a few further examples may be cited Thus a floating debt converted on June 7 I902 into 3 per cent securities of the consolidated internal debt to the amount of I0236149 had its sole origin in a credit of I597024 in February I889 and there fore includes interest accumulations to the amount of 8639125 for a term of thirteen years or more than five times the principal sum Two loans to the aggregate amount of 36973237 bearing interest at the rate of 2 per cent a month were made in I896 to the regie and guaranteed by the Dominican Government Re demption payments were made with more or less regularity until I900 but despite this the present nominal amount of the claim is 81250579 The traveling expenses of a certain revolutionary propagandist in I9023 to the amount of 6857 were acknowledged with a bonus of IOO per cent apparently regarded as interest com pensation Transactions of this nature are unusual only with respect to publicity and their essential character is typical of a large part of the Dominican unfunded debt 103

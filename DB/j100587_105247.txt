CHRISTCHURCH OXON F R S TO THE REV THOMAS BIRCH D D SECRET R S REVEREND SIR A S WE KNOW LITTLE OF THE REIGNS OF THE LATTER PARTHIAN KINGS AND LESS STILL OF THEIR COINS AN ATTEMPT TO STRIKE OUT EVEN THE LEAST NEW LIGHT ON EITHER OF THOSE HEADS WILL NOT I PER SUADE MYSELF PROVE UNACCEPTABLE TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY IN THIS PERSUASION I DO MYSELF THE HONOUR TO SEND YOU A FEW CONJECTURES UPON ANOTHER BRASS PARTHIAN MEDAL IN MY POSSESSION AS REMARKABLE ON ACCOUNT OF THE DOUBLE LEGEND IT CONTAINS AS THE FORMER WHICH I ENDEAVOURED A LITTLE TO ILLUSTRATE ABOUT A YEAR AGO THIS MEDAL WHICH CERTAINLY MERITS THE ATTENTION OF THE CURIOUS IS IN VERY GOOD CONSERVATION AND AP PROACHES NEAR THE SIZE OF THOSE OF THE MIDDLE ROMAN BRASS IT EXHIBITS THE HEAD OR EFFIGIES OF A PARTHIAN KING WITH A BEARD DIADEM AND HAIR FORMED INTO SUCH CURLS AS I NEVER YET OBSERVED UPON ANY AN TIENT COINS UNDER THE EFFIGIES THE GREEK LETTERS    WHICH DEMONSTRATE THE PIECE TO BE PARTHIAN APPEAR AND ON THE REVERSE A VICTORY DONE SOMETHING AFTER THE ROMAN MANNER THO THE WORKMANSHIP IS PRETTY RUDE PRESENTS ITSELF TO OUR VIEW TOGETHER WITH A LEGEND IN A LANGUAGE AND READ MAR 24 1757176 AND CHARACTER AT THIS TIME UNKNOWN THE LEGEND CONSISTS OF TEN COMPLETE ELEMENTS PLACED BEHIND THE VICTORY ABOVEMENTIONED BESIDES WHICH THERE IS ONE IN THE FIELD OF THE MEDAL BEING PROBABLY THE INITIAL LET TER OF THE NAME OF THE CITY WHERE THE COIN WAS STRUCK THE METAL THO TERMED BY ME BRASS DISCOVERS SOME THING OF A COMPOSITION SIMILAR TO THAT OF HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF DEVONSHIRES MEDAL OF VOLOGESES III AS DESCRIBED BY 1 SIG

IT DRAWN UP IN THE SHORTEST AND MOST CONCISE MANNER POSSIBLE 1 THE GREEK LEGEND HAD ALL OF IT APPEARED WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE BEEN EITHER   MONNHCHC OR    MONNHCHC OF WHICH I SHOULD CHUSE THE FORMER NOTWITHSTANDING IT IS SUCH PARTHIAN GREEK AS THE ROUND OF THE MEDAL SEEMS NOT TO HAVE BEEN CAPABLE OF CONTAINING THE LATTER IT WILL BE AT FIRST SIGHT OBSERVED THAT THIS LEGEND IS DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE PARTHIAN COINS HITHERTO DESCRIBED WHICH ARE EXHIBITED IN THE 2 GENITIVE NOT THE NOMINATIVE CASE THE LAST TWO LETTERS MO LEAVE NO ROOM TO DOUBT THO THE O IS NOT SO EXTREMELY WELL PRESERVED THAT

THE BETA WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED ON THIS PIECE AS MOST EVIDENTLY APPEARS FROM A PARTICLE OF THAT LETTER VISIBLE IN ITS PROPER PLACE FROM WHENCE WE MAY INFER THAT THE CHA RACTER I AM CONSIDERING MUST BE MU AS ALPHA BETA AND MU WERE THE ONLY INITIAL LETTERS ACCORDING TO DR VAILLANT 5 OF THE NAMES OF THE PARTHIAN KINGS REIGNING AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF THE OMEGA OF THE MINUSCULAR

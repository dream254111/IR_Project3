Committee of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America Fire waste is as old as life It has always been considered meas urably necessary Its cost has for many yearsvirtually through out the civilized world without limit even to national boundaries been distributed as a burden upon all the people through the medium of fire insurance There is a marked difference in the amount of this waste measured per capita or on an insurance basis between differ ent nations as well as between groups of nations On the average the cost of fire waste and insurance in western Europe is about one tenth that in North America due mainly to better building con struction more intelligent control of occupancy thriftier habits of the people and better governmental regulation of the entire subject abroad Until quite recent years the real causes and corrections of fire waste with us have been clearly known and understood only by the relatively small circle of fire insurance underwriters and their asso ciates About ten years ago the plan of a state officer empowered to investigate and regulate fire waste was first adopted in Massachu setts By 1906 about half a dozen other states had followed suit During the past five years there has been a marked awakening throughout all circles of the country concerning the size and character of fire waste in life and property and the fact that it is in large part needless and preventable During this time forty states have in stalled fire marshals or other officers with similar powers and many municipalities having realized that the bulk of this danger and loss was in their congested areas have begun to exercise police power more freely and intelligently through varying agencies to con trol and abate it Of late especially civic and commercial bodies are recognizing their stake and responsibility in the matter and are beginning with fast growing understanding to take a determined hand in bettering fire waste conditions Insurance which distributes the cost of fire waste is so much a part of the whole question that it must now be briefly reviewed 104FIRE WASTE The insurance world as a whole has in physical and engineering research rendered magnificent assistance in working out the problem of fire control As a business proposition of conducting commercial fire insurance underwriting at a profitinsurance is procurable on properly located constructed protected occupied and managed property in America at low final coston the one hand from the fac tory insurance associations groups of certain stock insurance com panies and from certain individual stock insurance companies which specialize in the insurance and reinsurance of such selected risks at low fixed charges and on the other hand from the asso ciated factory mutual fire insurance companies mill mutuals on low mutual charges determined by the final net co6perative loss Much farm and village property is insured in numerous small rural mutual companies throughout the country The mill mutuals operate through a central inspection bureau aided by a laboratory for the study and determination of physical standardsboth in Bos ton They as well as the stock factory insurance associations are specially active in spreading the doctrine of fire prevention in all its phases and hence are able to conduct continuously profitable under writing at net final charges of from five to ten cents per 100 Such insurance is all done without commissions to agents and brokers Insurance in the United States covers about 35000000000 of propertyabout 80 per cent of which is stock insurance averaging a rate of approximately 1 per cent per annum The bulk of city property is stock insured at flat rates These rates are determined by the application of an automatic universal rate schedule based on the ideal building for its respective occu pancy on an ideal location which is modified by the local rate con ditions fixed by the local stock underwriting board having juris diction and further modified by the conditions of the property itself ascertained through surveys by the same local board Many of these local boards have especially in recent years displayed commendable interest and energy in broadcasting fire preventive doctrines and the active managers of these have wel comed the submission of plans for construction and reconstruction of buildings in advance for criticism as to fire prevention and protec tionall of which is admirable work Others however are so in fluenced by the agent and broker element in their membership as to be indifferent to this aim 105THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY The total personnel of all these interweaving boards is so great however and the views and purposes so varying that no fixed gen eral policy is yet in evidence on their part as a whole to exercise their best knowledge experience and influence to prevent fire waste to the practical limits possible The National Board of Fire Underwriters New York is the stock body which speaks for the policy of the stock insurance in terests It operates the Underwriters Laboratories INC Chicago for the detailed physical study and determination of fire appliances standards of appliances in general co6peration with the Mutual Lab oratory Boston and does much good publicity work The National Fire Protection Association which numbers in its active membership all the stock and mutual boards bureaus asso ciations etc as well as a large and growing number of engineering and trades associations of national scope combines the general engineering opinion of the country on the physical facts relating to fire danger and formulates the standard rules and requirements standards of practice to control fire hazard of every description promulgated by the National Board of Fire Underwriters for the guidance of its associated local boards Copies of these standards are procurable by any one from these bodies The National Fire Protection Association is the best equipped organization in existence today in experience on the subject of fire waste and its control and the most altruistic and progressive of these formed in large part of insurance representatives It is grow ing more and more representative of all the interests of the country touching this problem It has been an active force in the past in spreading the general doctrine of fire prevention and promises in the near future to become a much more effective influence in this propaganda The twentyfive odd state fire prevention associations in as many states composed almost entirely of insurance personnel are also doing excellent work in firepreventive inspections and public education So far in this country almost every fire safeguard has been a matter of voluntary adoption Too much liberty has been left to the individual about constructing protecting equipping occupying and managing propertyto suit his greed ignorance indifference or shiftlessnessthus permitting a frightful loss in life and prop 106FIRE WASTE erty resulting in a constant heavy and largely useless waste in both to the whole people The bulk of insurance influence to date has exerted itself in 1 A protest in general terms against fire waste 2 the preparation of physical standards usable to control the evil 3 a system of un derwriting which as a rule penalizes bad conditions only by charging a high rate on such bad conditions which are discovered by constant inspection and limiting the amount of such risks written Most of the bulk underwriting is done through agents and brokers now claimed to be too highly paid and inadequately regulated whose influence is baneful to the extent that both on the average are merely eager to do the largest business at the highest commission and hence are not interested in property loss as owner or insurer Losses when they occur are usually settled through adjusters who also need more regulationas recent arson cases in New York and Chicago have disclosed In the main the aim of the large ma jority of insurance underwriters is to make their business profitable This end is best attained by collecting the largest gross premiums and saving at least half of these by skillful business management the method being a continued process of leaving property largely as it is found or alleged charging the highest obtainable rate distribut ing the risk paying good agents and brokers liberally for securing such contracts averaging over 20 per cent of the gross premiums and taking chances on fire loss without any special provision for the life hazard Such is the bare outline of the machinery physical and commer cial which insures property against fire in America Almost all we know about the physical engineering control of fire danger has been originated and brought to its present perfection through the medium of insurance engineers It is enough at this date if sufficiently widely known and applied to be fully 90 per cent efficient hence we should now center our attention on applying it adequately It must be clear why under these loosely controlling conditions we have so much fire waste of life and property in America How can anyone question the conclusion that society should now fully measure and reckon with this common and largely controllable danger to life and property and sternly and effectively take the situation in hand all over the country through appropriate legal regulation both for humanitarian and economic reasons 107THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY Substantial relief from this danger can be brought about in any state or city by any group of men or almost by any one man who will devote time money purpose and intelligence to this end It is pertinent here to briefly review recent history on this sub ject in Pennsylvania and Philadelphia to make this point clear although this closely touches my own activities Starting actively on the problem here early in 1911 I have been able by gradually disseminating correct information creating interest and winning support of individuals and organizations to pro cure the passage of legislation in its present effective form establish ing the offices of Pennsylvania state and Philadelphia city fire mar shals and to completely reorganize the operation of the latter office so that it now does efficient work through the agency of the Phila delphia fire prevention commission The Philadelphia fire marshal now has the use of seventyfive active firemen whose time was formerly absolutely wasted who in spect and reinspect about three hundred buildings per day and all the theaters in accord with an absolute continuous system They have within six months corrected over 60000 firebreeding condi tions and all of this work has been done to the distinct betterment of fire danger to life and propertyin this city As this work in Philadelphia planned and initiated as above described progressed we found much valuable data and experience procurable from a few other progressive states and cities in the country It was evident however that the great bulk of the coun try was scarcely awake to the known means whereby nationwide actual progress in fire waste control could be effected and only touched the high spots in their solution of the problemand these not in common As the cost of insurance is admittedly a nation wide tax based on the average of the total fire waste of property and associated expenses including the cost for public fire protection it is obvious that there must be a nationwide reduction of fire waste if the insurance cost is to be reduced and further that loss of life and health and from business interruption arising from this cause can only be lowered by reducing the property loss The United States Geological Survey Bulletin No 418 1907 on The Fire Tax and Waste of Structural Materials in the United States as well as the annual reports of the National Board of Fire Underwriters during the past five years provide the best summaries of this waste which 108FIRE WASTE is now estimated at 300000000 per annum or including associated costs 450000000 per annumthe lower figure averaging a charge of 3 per capita per annum upon every man woman and child in the country distributed throughout everything they use in life Admittedly a legally enforced policy of fire prevention and protection all over the country would attack the source of fire waste and would save according to the soundest judgment from onehalf to twothirds of this loss in life and property within the life of most of the people now living This is the most important avenue of improvement in life and property loss from fire and of reduction in insurance cost The further possible reduction in insurance cost de rivable from lowering the expense of doing business by the reduc tion of the extravagant commissions paid for selling insurance contracts can only be referred to here Fire the cause of all this trouble is always local in origin Un der our governmental system the state is the unit of local control and can in turn regulate its cities and country districts and so we must look to a sum totaluniform as nearly as may beof state ac tion imposed in turn over all of the area of each if we are to elim inate the bulk of American fire waste Progress in this matter in a few states and cities does not bring reasonable or adequate relief Large and wide betterment must be achieved to produce an average proper reduction in life and property waste and in the cost of insurance and public fire protection Has not the time come however for the national government to do a great service to the country by collecting the total studies on fire waste prevention protection and insurance and formulating these suggestions and conclusions for use by the country as a whole While every fire is local in its origin the sum total of all fires or fire waste is certainly national in effect and the necessary method of collecting this tax through the virtually semipublic function of insurance underwriting and the insurance policy contract constitutes a truly national problem with us at this time I quote in conclusion on this point from the Illinois fire insur ance commission From nearly every standpoint fire insurance seems to be inter state in its nature perhaps more nearly so than any other business It is based upon averages and distribution and if we take into account large conflagrations neither average nor distribution can be intelli gently applied within the limits of any single state 109

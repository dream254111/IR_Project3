welfare which have come from zoological research and the application of the resulting discoveries On the contrary I shall tend to stress the contributions which biology and in particular zoology may make through education which aims to ex tend scientific knowledge to everybody Moreover my ciolleagues have chosen to speak concerning the contributions of zool ogy to human welfare in lines which are directly useful with reference to the phys ical wellbeing of the human race Hence they have emphasized the practical bear ings of zoological science in its applica tions to the production of useful animals and plants and in the relations of certain animals to human health In short a strong case has been made for zoology as a science which has immensely important oontribu tions to the economic and hygienic welfare of the human race With all this emphasis on zoology in its direct material or physical bearings on human life I most heartily agree As a matter of education I be lieve in applied zoology which stresses the science of animals as they economically or hygienically affect mankind but I re gard zoology limited to its direct material usefulness to its contributions to physical human welfare as failing to develop the possibilities of the science as it may affect racial welfare land intellectual welfare Hence I have devoted my paper to zool 1 Read by title before Section F American

AND INTELLECTUAL LIFE One who studies critically the educa tional essays of the pioneer educatorbiol ogist Thomas Henry Huxley must be deeply impressed with the important rela tions and possible applications of biology to daily life In Huxleys remarkable ad dress The Educational Value of the Nat ural History Sciences delivered in 1854 and in those maturer ones On the Study of Biology in 1876 and Science and Culture in 1880 Huxley grasped the vast significance of biology in relation to human life at the fullest development of its phys ical intellectual ethical moral and esthetic possibilities Looking as he always did at human life and science and education with a farreaching vision Huxley needed for his own estimate of the value of science no such a sharp distinction between pure science and applied science as has become common in these later years To most educated people today the terms applied science or practical science suggest some phase of technology such as indus trial chemistry or electrical engineering or scientific housekeeping or modern agri culture or hygienic problems in short ap plied science now commonly means the use of science in the material or physical affairs of life Rarely indeed do we now find educational discussions which consider science as applicable to the intellectual and emotional aspects of the life of educated citizens No such a limited view of ap plied science appealed to Huxley He saw clearly many applications of science and of biology in particular to the intellectual and emotional aspects of life in addition to the physical or material welfare to which he often gave appropriate emphasis I refer especially to his lecture On the Study of Biology only one of many lec tures in which he showed that to him biol ogy had an applied or practical bearing on our lives through the intellectual or philosophical problems which evolution and other scientific doctrines have forced to the attention of most welleducated people Huxley illustrated his view of the higher intellectual value of biology as applied science by pointing out the great signifi cance to intelligent people of the evolution ary theory of man s relation to nature Evidently this theory has nothing to do with biology applied to the material affairs which affect our physical welfare for it is of no value in hygiene agriculture or other practical applications of biology but I think that most of us will agree that courses which do not open up for students the great intellectual value of evolution and other biological theories do not deserve to be named either pure biology or applied biology In fact I have come to believe that no phase of biology which has a purely physical application to human welfare such as bacteria and disease or biology applied to agriculture is more important for the average educated citizen than a general understanding of the evolution theory Hence I urge that our conception of applied biology for general education must be large enough to include the in tellectual as well as the more directly prac tical aspects which affect human welfare economically and hygienically Summarizing Huxleys views of biology as applied science biological knowledge is practical utilitarian and applicable to hu man welfare 1 in many lines e g agri culture which are industrial or economic 2 in hygienic problems

SCIENCESCIENCE tended outlook upon biology as applied science in the larger sense that we now need for the purposes of general and liberal edu cation We are living in an age that is emi nently industrial commercial and practical There are signs that we tend to consider education as productive of results measur able in purely material terms If we fol low closely such tendencies while we are reorganizing biology into applied science we are likely to interpret the word ap plied as limited to the material and espe cially the commercial affairs of life and then we shall leave no place for the intellec tual and esthetic values of biological study I have thus at some length advocated a larger conception of biology as applied sci ence that functions in our daily life in that it definitely concerns intellectual welfare This is why I believe in education that pres ent applied biology in the largest sense of the word applied namely biology that sets forth in bold relief the great facts and leading ideas which touch human life in its combined economic industrial hy gienic intellectual and esthetic outlook Applied biology then should be under stood in the larger sense as meaning a selec tion from the vast field of biological learn ing of those facts and ideas which are likely to mean most in the life of the average edu cated man and woman Thus zoology may through education come to make the great est possible contribution to human welfare There has long been a feeling even among scientific men themselves that the philosophical applications of biological generalizations are more or less interesting for the purposes of mental gymnastics but that they have no important bearing on the practical relations of science to human life How often have we heard the theory of evolution referred to as a strictly pure sci ence generalization without possible appli cation to practical affairs In all this we seem to have been decidedly in error for we have overlooked the fact that a philo sophical application of a purescience theory may come to be a guiding force in the material affairs to which science is di rectly applied Such is the case in the re lation of certain phases of evolutionary philosophy to the Great War A striking illustration of the profound bearing of philosophical biology particu larly zoology on human welfare is found in the German justification of the present world struggle which seems to be opening the way to overwhelming revolutions of our economic social political ethical and even religious systems It is clear to many American men of science that the German philosophy of the superior state or nation and the superior race or people and the superior qualities of Kultur of the people as a group is at bottom an evolutionary philosophy based on the German zoologists conception of the Allmacht or allsuffi ciency of the Darwinian theory of survival of the fittest in the universal struggle for existence among living things This biolog ical principle in the extreme interpretation of NeoDarwinism has been widely adopted by influential German philosophers Of course the German doctrine of supe riority is not all an application of philo sophical biology for there is obviously an admixture of the peculiar religious state of mind characteristic of many German writ ers in the universities and in the govern ment As proof of this we may call to mind the longstanding dual alliance between the Kaiser and his Gott and judging from many fervently religious phrases in imper ial proclamations relating to glorious victories in Belgium and Serbia the mutual understanding between Wilhelm II and his invisible and silent partner continues to exist However we must not allow the religious attitude of those at the center of 3 JULY 5 1918N S VOL XLVIII No 1227 the Hohenzollern dynasty to lead us to be lieve that religion is the determining factor in establishing the prevailing German atti tude regarding war as the justifiable method of extending their assumed supe riority The members of the Kaisers fam ily may sincerely believe because they have been educated to believe in their divine rights and affiliations but it is impossible that traditional religion has played more than a minor part in developing the clearly evolutionary philosophy of German supe riority that has spread centrifugally from the universities especially through the in fluence of many writers who were not liable to classification as religiously inclined Perhaps the religion of the people of the masses has led them to accept as a religious idea the doctrine of superiority made by German evolutionary thinkers and spread broadcast by the means of an educational system that with marvelous skill was planned to promulgate and ultimately to put into worldwide practise the clearly evolutionary doctrine of German superior ity over the rest of mankind In biological philosophy intellectual Ger many seems to find good in this war and indeed in all wars as a means of express ing force or might of the state which in the German national philosophy is always right because the fittest win in the struggle Of course it matters not so far as we are inquiring into the possible influence of bio logical philosophy on human welfare that numerous German biologists and philoso phers have accepted an evolution factor whose Allmacht has long been denied by the great majority of biologists outside of Germany For our present purposes the fact is that whether right or wrong a bio logical theory has been made to support a national state of mind which is now threat ening the very foundations of human wel fare Of course it is beside the point but to a biologist an interesting question whether NeoDarwinism has been widely ac cepted by the intellectuals of Germany be cause of scientific facts in its favor or be cause it fitted in with a previously accepted doctrine of right determined by might Be that as it may the one conclusion I wish to draw from the German philosophy of superiority is that we should find an im portant lesson in the fact that a theory largely zoological in its origin and in its human applications has been brought into conflict with human welfare as we Ameri cans see it with the larger vision I have arrived now at my main thesis that only through organized education can the physical and intellectual values of zool ogy be made to contribute to human wel fare in the largest sense The fact that the German superior state of mind to which we object was developed by national education and education thus worked against human welfare is obviously no argument against education but only against a phase of edu cation limited to the purposes of those in power II ZOOLOGY AND EUGENICS I come now to the relation of zoology to racial welfare in other words the problem of eugenics It is evident that the appli cation of the laws of heredity or genetics to the breeding of more useful animals is simply another aspect of economic zoology and one whose total financial value is bound to continue to be greater than that of all other phases of practical zoology combined We need only compare in cursory survey any of our valuable cultivated or domesti cated strains of the animals and plants of agriculture with the most closely related wild forms in order to realize the vast eco nomic significance of mans applications of known and unknown principles of heredity 4 SCIENCEJULY 5 1918 SCIENCE On the other hand the human problem of applied heredity or eugenics is far from being such a simple business problem be cause the desired results can not be evalu ated on a purely economic basis In short eugenics unlike the biologically parallel breeding of animals and plants is not a phase of economic zoology except perhaps in the indirectly involved economic prob lems arising from human defectives and inefficients Eugenics is at present a bio logical philosophy and must be developed and promulgated accordingly namely through education As the biologist so well realizes the production df better hu man strains involves not only the physical problems of heredity but also the vastly more complicated social emotional and re ligious traditions which concern human families as they are organized today Be fore established biological principles of heredity can be applied to the human race either by individuals or by nations a eu genic philosophy must be accepted This is the next and necessary step in the pro gram of the eugenic movement More re search may bring stronger conviction that the eugenic proposals are scientifically true but little progress can be made ex cept through an educational movement which distributes widely among intelligent people a eugenic philosophy which deals adequately with the biological social and other factors involved Such an educa tional movement for eugenics must be based on biology and especially on zoology which more directly illustrates human life and its problems By education I do not mean schools and colleges only for I am thinking of the vast possibilities of popu lar education such as in the past year has been applied by lectures magazines news papers pamphlets and posters to the great food questions An energetic and sweep ing educational campaign will some day be necessary if the average intelligent citi zen is to be made to realize what the eu genic proposition may mean for racial wel fare Here is a possible contribution of zoology to human welfare compared with which all others are of minor importance As in the case of those philosophical prin ciples of biology which may profoundly influence human thought and action there is now in sight only one pathway leading towards progress in applying the estab lished biological science to eugenic prac tise That pathway is labelled Educa tion MAURICE H BIGELOW TEACHERS COLLEGE COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY SCIENTIFIC EVENTS

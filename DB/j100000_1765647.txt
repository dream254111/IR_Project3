Territory Uintahite is also very brittle When heated it melts readily but will not burn This sub stance is hauled in wagons from the mines near Fort Duchesne in Uintah County to Pleasant Valley Junction on the Rio Grand Western Railway a distance of more than a hundred miles to be shipped East for the manu facture of varnish Wurtzillite bears a remarkably close resemblance to uintahite It has a similar color lustre fracture and specific gravity and it is about equally brittle But wurt zillite readily burns yielding a bright light from the com bustion of illuminating gases Again its streak is black and it is slightly sectile being capable of being cut or pared by a knife much as rubber or horn may be pared Wurtzillite has been reported from Wasatch County as well as from Emery and JUintah Counties in considerable amount Asphaltum occurs in Emery and San Pete Coun ties It is somewhat mixed with sand and other impuri ties but it is already being mined in considerable quan tity for paving the streets of various Western cities In addition to wurtzillite uintahite asphaltum and ozocerite other hydrocarbons are found in Utah for ex amplealbertite petroleum and natural gas But as yet none of the latter have been made productive HENRY MONTGOMERY University of Utah Salt Lake City July 29 ANIMAL VOCABULARIES A GOOD deal has been said about the probable existence of definite vocabularies in the language of the lower ani mals and I believe one has gone to Africa to study Simian speech This is all well enough but there is no need of going beyond the barn yard to hear a definite animal vocabulary of a considerable number of words Hear the roosters warning cry when he sees or hears indications of danger It is a definite sound and perfectly understood by every hen and chick Drop food to the mother hen She quickly inspects it and if approved tells the little ones to eat by uttering her well known Coot coot coot  If she decides that it is not fit to eat she as plainly tells them to let alone The other day a green worm fell from a tree near a brood of chickens Every chick ran to seize the morsel The mother gave one quick glance at the in sect and said Skrrrp  Every chick stopped instantly But one wilful child loth to believe his mothers assur ance that it wasnt fit to eat would make him sick etc started a second time to pick up the worm Slcrrrp  commanded the hen sharply Even the wilful child obeyed this time and the whole brood walked off content edly Discuss as we will the particular reason for the hens cackle before and after laying the fact remains that it is a definite utterance as plainly understood by both gallinse and homines as any expression in human speech My horse has a low whinny which means water and a higherkeyed more emphatic neigh means food When I hear these sounds I know as definitely what she means as if she spoke in English This morning passing along the street I heard that same low whinny and looking up saw a strange horse regarding me with a pleading look I knew he was suffering from thirst and no language could make it plainer The language of the lower animals is not all articulate It is largely a sign language The horse does a deal of talking by motions of the head and by his wonderfully expressive looks He also upon occasion talks with the other extremity A peculiar switch of the tail and a ges ture as if threatening to kick are equine forms of speech The darkey was not far wrong who said of the kicking mule Its just his way of talking  Vol XXII No 549 The dog can not only look volumes but can express whole sentences by wags of the tail more readily than can the waving flags of the signal corps All that is necessary is to learn his code We expect our domestic animals to learn our language and punish them cruelly if they fail to both understand and obey our commands yet notwith standing our higher intelligence we fail to learn their language by means of which we might better understand their wants and dispositions and thus control them by kindness and sympathy instead of by harsh and arbitrary treatment I see horses passing along the street which are saying by every look and motion that they are suffer ing acute torture from a too short check rein Their drivers are often people who would be shocked if they could comprehend their own cruelty But they do not understand horse language and some of them do not seem to have horse sense The language of animals is a neglected subject The facilities for its study are within the reach of all and no previous preparation is required The study can be pur sued without interfering with other occupations and even a little systematic observation will bring large returns in both pleasure and profit CIIARLES B PALMER Columbus Ohio A MAYA MONTHNAMEKHMERS IN Science Aug 4 Professor Thomas gives a new name to the 17th month of the Maya calendar on the basis of a phonetic rendering of its symbol I do not intend to dispute the correctness of his ren dering I think it quite possible he is right but I serious ly question his inference that because the symbol reads alyab that therefore was the monthname The work leayab is from the verbal stem kay to sing or warble As this concept cannot be objectively represented the lIayas had recourse to a method very familiar with them that of the rebus to convey or keep in memory its approximate sounds They chose to indicate the guttur al initial k by a turtle called in their tongue ale prefix ing it to the syllable yab This method of writing is what I have called  ikono matic and I have shown abundant instances of it in Mexico and Central America See my Essays of an Americanist pp 213229 Through neglecting to regard its principles both Prof Thomas and Dr Seler have made several obvious errors in translating the Mexican and Maya codices as I expect to show in a work I am preparing on the calendar system of those nations With regard to the origin of the Khmers and their ethnic affiliation I do not think that Professor Keanes claim is relevant to that put forward by Dr Maurel The latter maintains that the Khmers belong to the Aryan in the sense of the Sanscritic peoples and that they are in Cambodia an intrusive stock arriving practically within historic times I understand Professor Keane to differ with both these opinions D G BRINTON Media Aug 7 THEORY OF COLOR SENSATION An objection to my theory of colorsensation an ab stract of which has lately appeared in Science has been more than once made to me which needs to be met but which can be met very easily It is that I suppose the three primary colorsensations to be conveyed to the brain by one and the same nerve and hence that the theory is not consistent with the widely accepted doctrine of the specific energy of nervesthe doctrine namely as ap plied to the eye that we recognize two reds to be like sensations not by any specific quality in the sensation but by the fact that they affect the same set of nerves and that if a pure blue light could by any possibility be

they depend on Pulkowa 1880 depending on Greenwich 1885 on Pulkowa and finally 1890 depending on Greenwich The corresponding corrections for 1847 which is the mean epoch of Boss system are taken as zero From the fact that these corrections to Boss do not vary uniformly with the time Prof Newcomb draws the con clusion that Bradleys observations must be in consistent with the truth which seems to imply that they are to be accorded no weight in form ing a normal system Yet we may well ask whether the numbers given by Prof Newcomb are accurate enough to furnish any information of reliability In his zone A the correction to Boss for 1755 is 223 But the ten numbers of which this is the mean have a range of no less than 400 So we can hardly escape the conviction that the whole conclusion may be vitiated by a large error in a particular star That this has occurred is not altogether impossible For zone B the corresponding mean is 027 with a range of 230 in the ten numbers whose mean has been taken We cannot regard conclusions based upon evi dence so discordant as final It is to be noted also that only one of the twenty stars used by Prof Newcomb is to be found in Boss mean system The other nineteen stars are among those taken by Prof Boss from the catalogues which were not used in forming the mean sys tem but which were reduced to the mean sys tem by the aid of systematic corrections In deed in all researches with Boss system we are met at every step by the insuperable difficulty that his original mean system does not contain stars enough to get rid of casual errors in indi vidual stars While therefore we agree with Prof Newcombs final conclusion that the system of Auwers cannot be regarded as definitive and that it requires revision we wish to point out that the same is true of the Boss system And finally we wish to repeat our former statement that it is not at present practically possible to employ the Boss system because the reductions to that system for the recent accurate cata logues have not been published This has been done with care for the Auwers system and un N S VoL III No 59 til it has been done for the Boss system astron omers wishing to

report on the Surface Geology of New Jersey some of the most important points are likely to be over looked by reason of the different names applied to the same formation by successive investi gators Fully to appreciate the light which Prof Salisburys investigations shed upon some of the points recently under discussion it is necessary after the manner of the mathema ticians to substitute in one equation its equiva lent in another What was formerly referred to as the Phila delphia Brick Clay was later correlated with the Columbia This however is now prop erly described by Prof Salisbury in the New Jersey report from its place of greatest develop ment in that State under the name of James burg of which he says there can be no doubt that it corresponds to the Columbia This de posit as developed on the Pennsylvania side of the Delaware River from Philadelphia to Tren ton was very carefully studied fifteen years ago by the late Prof Carvill Lewis his views regarding it being embodied in various papers published about that time and finally in the last chapter of Abbotts Primitive Industry pp 524527 published in 1881 His conclu sions were  that this clay may be assigned to a period when the land stood 150 feet or more below its present level and when the cold waters from the melting glacier bore ice rafts which dropped their boulders After going over much of this field with Prof Lewis I adopted these views and incorporated them into my various references to the subject See especially Proc of the Boston Soc of Nat Hist Jan 19 1881 p 141 Ice Age in North America p 523 and later in Am Jour Sci March 1894 pp 180 181 It is gratifying to see that Prof Salisburys studies upon the New Jersey side of the river lead him to substan tially the same conclusions First in opposi tion to Mr Upham he now holds that p 126CIENCE it seems certain that the formation James burg was produced during the submergence of the area which it covers secondly p 128 that the period of submergence must have been short and thirdly p 129 that the amount of erosion accomplished since the de position of the Jamesburg is slight This is shown   by the undissected flats of this material even where in close association with considerable streams   Either the forma tion is very recent or conditions since its de velopment have been most unfavorable for erosion    The small amount of erosion which it has suffered seems hardly consistent with its correlation with the earliest glacial epoch In order to understand the distinct advance here made one has but to refer to Prof Cham berlins article in the American Journal of Science for March 1893 pp 191 192 where he enumerates among the features which he thinks may be accepted as demonstrative first that an older fluviatile deposit the Phil adelphia Brick Clay is to be associated in age with the old glacial drift and that after the formation of this older river deposit which took place at a low altitude and a low gradient there wasan epoch of elevation and erosion during which the Delaware cut its channel down to the depth of 200 or 300 feet below the upper old ter race It would seem now that this interpreta tion must be abandoned for the Delaware as a similar interpretation had to be abandoned for the gravel terraces near the junction of the Cone wango and the Allegheny Rivers two years ago Mr Salisbury is undoubtedly correct in believ ing that these high level gravel and clay de posits in the Delaware Valley in the vicinity of Trenton are of comparatively recent deposi tion They are not older but younger than the erosion of the rock channel of the Dela ware I may say in conclusion also that the investi gations of Prof E H Williams in the Lehigh Valley which have been too little noticed seem positively to show that the river channels of that whole region had been worn to nearly their present depth of rock bottom before the earliest period of glaciation I trust that re newed attention will be attracted to this diffi 243 cult problem concerning which so many facts have now beei accumulated G FREDERICKWRIGHT OBERLIN 0 January 29 1896 ANCIENT MEXICAN FEATHER WORK AT THE COLUMBIAN HISTORICAL EXPOSITION AT MADRID 1892 To THE EDITOR OF SCIENCE Under the above title a contribution of mine has appeared in the recently issued Report of the U S Com mission on the Madrid Exposition Government Printing Office Washington 1895 Owing to the fact that the proofs were not sent to me for revision mypaper contains several typograph ical errors three of which particularly demand correction It being too late to rectify these errors by any other means I have adopted the present method of doing so with the hope and earnest request that possessors of copies of the report will duly note them therein in order to prevent future misunderstandings On page 332 read that I identified the shield of Phillip II at the Royal Armory Madrid as being of HispanoMexican workmanship in October 1892 instead of 1893 as printed On page 335 read the tiny instead of the wing feathers   that grow on the heads and breasts of tropical humming birds On page 337 read Mr Phillip Becker instead of Bectier I need scarcely state that in my original text the name of my late highly esteemed friend is correctly given and is not followed by an interrogation point Thanking you in advance for kindly afford ing me the opportunity to do myself

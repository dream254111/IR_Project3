OAKLAND CAL IT IS APPRECIATED HERE AS ELSEWHERE THAT THE GREAT MOTIVE POWER BACK OF THIS WORLDWIDE HEALTH MOVEMENT IS THE DISCOVERY OF THE GERM THEORY OF DISEASE THROUGH THE EFFORTS OF OUR SCIENTISTS TO WHOM THE DEEPEST GRATITUDE IS FELT AND TO WHOM THE HIGHEST PRAISE MUST BE GIVEN THE PROOF OF THE APPRECIATION OF THE WORK CAN BE BEST EXPRESSED BY SPREADING THIS NEW GOSPEL AN EMINENT SURGEON SAYS THAT MORE HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS THAN IN THIRTY CENTURIES BEFORE CHEMISTRY PHYSIOLOGY BACTERIOLOGY HYGIENE SANITATION DIET ETICS PSYCHOLOGY PHILANTHROPY JURISPRUDENCE SOCIOLOGY AND CRIM INOLOGY ARE GIVING THE REQUIRED KNOWLEDGE THAT ONLY NEEDS PRACTICAL APPLICATION TO BRING TO HUMANITY HEALTH IN ITS WIDEST AND TRUEST SENSE THE HEALTH THAT ENABLES MAN TO DEVELOP THE HIGHEST AND BEST OF WHICH HE IS CAPABLE IN HIS PHYSICAL MENTAL AND MORAL NATURE UNDOUBTEDLY THE FIRST GREAT STEP HAS BEEN THE TUBERCULOSIS CAMPAIGNS WHICH HAVE STIMULATED GREATER ACTIVITY IN OVERCOMING OTHER DISEASES ESPECIALLY THOSE OF AN INFECTIOUS NATURE THE TUBERCULOSIS ASSOCIATIONS HAVE BEEN ACTIVE THROUGHOUT THE WEST A SPECIAL INTEREST WAS AWAKENED IN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON BY THE TUBERCULOSIS AND PUBLIC HEALTH EXHIBIT AT THE ALASKA YUKONPACIFIC EXPOSITION HELD IN SEATTLE IN I909 ENTHUSIASTIC LOCAL LEAGUES WERE FORMED IN MANY COUNTIES THERE IS AN ACTIVE STATE SOCIETY WHILE WASHINGTON HAS AN EXCELLENT LAW PROVID ING FOR THE REPORTING OF CASES AND FOR DISINFECTION THIS LAW HAS BEEN A DEAD LETTER FROM THE FIRST THAT IS FOR ELEVEN YEARS FOR LACK OF FUNDS STRENUOUS EFFORTS WILL BE MADE AT THE PRESENT LEGIS LATURE TO PROCURE AN APPROPRIATION IN OREGON IOOOO HAS BEEN EXPENDED THROUGH THE VISITING NURSES ASSOCIATION IN CARING FOR INDIGENT TUBERCULARS A STATE SANITARIUM WELL EQUIPPED ACCOMMODATES I50 PATIENTS THE PENI TENTIARY AND INSANE ASYLUM HAVE SEPARATE OUTDOOR PAVILIONS FOR THEIR TUBERCULAR INMATES CALIFORNIA HAS A STATE ASSOCIATION WHICH ALSO HAS BEEN 331THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY GREATLY LIMITED BY LACK OF FUNDS SEVENTYFIVE PER CENT OF ALL THE MONEY REACHING ITS TREASURY HAS BEEN RECEIVED FROM LOS ANGELES THE GREAT PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA IS NOT OF THE NATIVE BORN WHO ACQUIRE THE DISEASE BUT THE PENNILESS CONSUMPTIVES WHO COME IN SUCH ADVANCED STAGES THAT CURE IS IMPOSSIBLE FIFTY PER CENT OF THE CASES BELONG TO THIS CLASS SO ACUTE DID CONDITIONS BECOME A FEW YEARS AGO THAT A CONFERENCE OF SOCIAL WORKERS THROUGH THE ASSOCIATED PRESS SENT AN APPEAL TO EASTERN ORGANIZATIONS TO REFRAIN FROM SENDING THEIR ADVANCED AND PENNI LESS CASES MANY OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FRUIT RANCHES ARE LARGELY COLONIZED BY CONSUMPTIVES AND MANY HAVE BEEN PER MANENTLY CURED IN BANNING 65 PER CENT OF THE INHABITANTS HAVE SETTLED THERE ON ACCOUNT OF TUBERCULOSIS EITHER IN THEM SELVES OR THEIR FAMILIES CALIFORNIA HAS NO PUBLIC SANATORIA FOR TUBERCULOUS CASES BUT ALLOWS A DOLLAR A DAY FOR EACH PATIENT TO CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS CARING FOR ITS CONSUMPTIVES TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BELONGS THE CREDIT OF HAVING ESTAB LISHED THE FIRST CHARITABLE SANATORIA FOR CONSUMPTIVESTHE RED LAND SETTLEMENT AT REDLAND THE BARLOW SANATORIUM LOS ANGELES THE STEHMAN SANATORIUM OF PASADENA AT ONE OF THE INSANE HOSPITALS A WIRE ENCLOSED YARD HAS BEEN FURNISHED FOR OUTDOOR LIFE FOR THE INMATES SO MUCH IS IT AP PRECIATED THAT A MERE SUGGESTION THAT HE WILL HAVE TO GO INDOORS IF HE IS BOISTEROUS OR NOISY CAUSES THE PATIENT TO BECOME DOCILE AND TRACTABLE LARGE NUMBERS OF EDUCATIONAL PAMPHLETS IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED BY THE TUBERCULOSIS SOCIETIES THROUGH THE SAN FRANCISCO ASSOCIATION FOR THE STUDY AND PREVENTION OF TUBERCULOSIS THE SUPERVISORS HAVE PASSED A MOST STRINGENT LAW WHICH PLACES SAN FRANCISCO UNQUESTIONABLY IN THE FOREMOST RANK SO FAR AS TUBERCULOUS LEGISLATION IS CONCERNED LECTURES HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO UNIONS FRATERNAL ORGANIZATIONS SETTLEMENT WORKERS MOTHERS CLUBS AND IN SCHOOLS AND CHURCHES THOUSANDS OF CIRCULARS HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED AT THESE LECTURES TUBERCULOSIS CLINICS ARE HELD IN SEVERAL OF THE LARGE CITIES ON THE COAST TUBERCULOSIS EXHIBITS BY MEANS OF DEMONSTRATION CARS LANTERN SLIDES AND MOVING PICTURES HAVE BEEN MOST FRUITFUL AGENTS IN EDUCATING THE PUBLIC ESPECIALLY IN CALIFORNIA THE INCREASED DEMAND FOR CERTIFIED MILK IS A DIRECT RESULT 332 88PUBLIC HEALTH MOVEMENT ON PACIFIC COAST OF THIS EDUCATION A RATHER UNUSUAL SIGN DO NOT SPIT HERE IS PLACED HIGH UPON THE WALL IN THE ASSESSORS OFFICE IN ONE OF OUR LARGE CITIES ITS POSITION AT ONCE ARRESTS THE ATTENTION AND CREATES A SMILE FOR NOT EVEN THE MOST INVETERATE SPITTER WOULD CHOOSE SUCH A PLACE BUT IT IS AN EFFECTIVE DETERRENT IN THE USE OF MOVING PICTURES MANY HEALTH SUBJECTS ARE IL LUSTRATED FOR EXAMPLE THE DANGERS OF IMPURE MILK OF THE FLY EVIL OF THE MALARIAL MOSQUITO AND THE BUBONIC FLEA APROPOS OF THE USE OF THESE NOVEL FILMS THIS LITTLE JINGLE BY GERTRUDE MCKENSIE IS TRANSCRIBED NO MORE WELL SEEK THE PICTURE SHOWS TO DRIVE AWAY DULL CARE TO SEE HOW CASEY LED THE GOAT OR WATCH THE COUNTY FAIR NO MORE UPON THE SCREEN WELL SEE HOW WILBUR WRIGHT CAN FLY WED RATHER WATCH THE PTOMAINES JUMP AND SEE THE GERMS WALTZ BY NO MORE WELL SEEK THE FAR NORTH POLE WITH PEARY OR WITH COOK OR SCOUR THE PLAINS WITH BRONCHO BILL WELL WATCH THE HOOKWORM HOOK WELL NO MORE LAUGH TO SEE PORTRAYED THE PRANKS OF LITTLE WILLIE WELL WATCH THE MICROBE DO ITS STUNTS AND CHEER THE NEW BACILLI CALIFORNIA HAS SEVERAL OPENAIR SCHOOLS FOR TUBERCULOUS CHIL DREN IN LOS ANGELES SAN FRANCISCO AND OAKLAND DR N K FOSTER THE MEDICAL INSPECTOR OF THE OAKLAND SCHOOLS CALIFORNIA HAS FURNISHED SOME INTERESTING DATA SHOWING THE AVERAGE GAIN IN WEIGHT OF A CLASS OF TUBERCULAR CHILDREN OUTOFDOORS AND THAT OF A CLASS OF THE SAME GRADE INDOORS EACH CHILD OF THE TWO CLASSES WAS WEIGHED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SCHOOL TERM AND AGAIN AT THE END OF THE TERM FIVE MONTHS LATER COMPARISON OF THE WEIGHTS FOR THE INDOOR CLASS OF NORMAL CHILDREN WITH THOSE OF THE OUT DOOR TUBERCULAR CHILDREN SHOWED AN AVERAGE GAIN FOR THE TUBER CULAR CHILD OVER THAT OF THE NORMAL CHILD OF 137 POUNDS DESPITE THE KNOWLEDGE GAINED OF THE VALUE OF FRESH AIR AND ITS APPLICATION IN THE CASE OF THE TUBERCULOUS THERE IS THE GREATEST DISREGARD OF ITS USE AS A PREVENTION OF DISEASE IT REALLY AMOUNTS TO CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE WHEN ONE CONSIDERS THE POORLY VENTILATED SCHOOLROOMS IN WHICH CHILDREN ARE OBLIGED TO SPEND FOUR OR FIVE HOURS A DAY SCARCELY A CHURCH LECTURE HALL THEATER RAILWAY 333 89THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY COACH OR ANY INDOOR PLACE WHERE PEOPLE CONGREGATE THAT DOES NOT SOON BECOME STUFFY CLOSE AND OPPRESSIVE THE HOPE OF THE FUTURE IS IN THE CHILD AND COMMON JUSTICE DEMANDS THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE DELETERIOUS INFLUENCES OF IMPURE AIR DANGEROUS AT ANY PERIOD OF LIFE AND ESPECIALLY TO THE GROWING CHILD THOUGH INSIDIOUS IT MAY PROVE AS GREAT A MENACE IN UNDERMINING THE SYSTEM IN THE FORMATIVE YEARS OF LIFE AS SOME OF THE DREADED INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF CHILDHOOD ONE WOULD SHRINK WITH LOATHING AND DISGUST FROM TAKING AGAIN INTO THE BODY THE WASTE FROM THE INTESTINAL CANAL OR URINAL TRACT YET VITIATED POL LUTED POISONOUS EXHALATIONS FROM THE LUNGS ARE CONSTANTLY BEING REBREATHED IN POORLY VENTILATED ROOMS A FEW YEARS AGO A PROMINENT ARCHITECT OF LARGE EXPERIENCE IN CALIFORNIA SAID THAT THERE WAS ONE PERFECTLY VENTILATED BUILDING IN THE STATE AND THAT A SMALL BANK IN WOODLAND IN RESPONSE TO THE QUERY WHETHER THE LAWS OF MECHANICS HAD BEEN APPLIED SUCCESSFULLY FOR SATISFACTORY VENTILATION HE REPLIED YES PERFECTLY IN THIS BANK THE FRESH AIR ENTERING THE BUILDING IS FORCED TO PASS THROUGH A SHEET OF WATER WHICH REMOVES IMPURITIES AND COOLS THE AIR IN SUMMER AND WARMS IT IN WINTER THE EXPENSE OF IN STALLING THE VENTILATING SYSTEM WAS 5000 A FEW DAYS AGO THE SAME ARCHITECT WAS ASKED IF THE WOODLAND BANK WAS STILL THE ONLY WELLVENTILATED BUILDING IN CALIFORNIA THE REPLY WAS THERE ARE NOW MANY PUBLIC BUILDINGS WELL EQUIPPED SOME THEATERS FEW CHURCHES BUT NO HOMES UNFORTUNATELY IN MANY OF THE BUILDINGS PROVIDED WITH AN ADEQUATE VENTILATING SYSTEM THE SUPERVISION IS FAULTY ESPECIALLY IN THE SCHOOL BUILDINGS THE TEACHER DEEPLY ABSORBED IN OTHER MATTERS IS THE LAST ONE TO HAVE CHARGE OF THE VENTILATING AND FEW JANITORS ARE EQUAL TO THE RE SPONSIBILITY NO ENGINEER NO MATTER HOW PERFECT HIS MACHINE WOULD THINK IT COULD BE RUN BY ONE NOT TRAINED AT FIRST THE EX PENSE OF INSTALLING THE VENTILATING PLANT WAS AT FAULT AND NOW THE EXPENSE OF SUPERVISING AND OPERATING THE PLANT IS THE CAUSE OF BAD AIR IN THE SCHOOLROOMS PERHAPS NO ONE HAS DONE MORE OF LATE THAN THE PSYCHOLOGIST IN DISCOVERING PHYSICAL HANDICAPS IN HIS ENDEAVOR TO DETERMINE THE DEGREE OF MENTAL DEFICIENCY IN THE BACKWARD CHILD THE DE TECTION OF PHYSICAL DEFECTS OR DEVIATIONS FROM THE NORMAL IN THEIR INCIPIENCY IS NOT OFTEN PERMITTED THE PHYSICIAN BECAUSE HIS AD 334 90PUBLIC HEALTH MOVEMENT ON PACIFIC COAST VICE IS RARELY SOUGHT UNTIL DEFECTS RESULTING FROM DISEASE HAVE ADVANCED SO FAR AS TO BE APPARENT TO THE LAITY SO AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE PUBLIC IS BEING EDUCATED THE PHYSICIAN IS STIMULATED TO USE EVERY MEANS AVAILABLE TO OBTAIN AN EARLY AND CORRECT DIAGNOSIS THERE IS NO WORK IN THE WEST COMPARABLE IN ITS ENTIRETY TO THAT BEING DONE IN THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA IN THE PSYCHO LOGICAL CLINIC UNDER THE DIRECTION OF DR LIGHTNER WITMER ONE SEES IN THIS CLINIC THE RESULTS OFTEN MOST GRATIFYING OF CORRECTING DEFECTIVE SIGHT OR HEARING OR FROM REMOVING IMPACTED OR DIS EASED TEETH OR ADENOIDS AND TONSILS AND OVERCOMING DIGESTIVE DISTURBANCES ANY ONE OF THESE CONDITIONS IN DIFFERENT CASES MAY REVEAL THE TREMENDOUS INFLUENCE OF A PHYSICAL DISABILITY IN AR RESTING NORMAL MENTAL OR MORAL DEVELOPMENT JUVENILE COURT JUDGES PROBATION OFFICERS AND SOCIAL WORKERS ALL BEGIN TO AP PRECIATE THE DETERRENT AND PERVERTING EFFECT OF PHYSICAL TROUBLES UPON THE NORMAL HEALTH OF THE CHILD NEITHER IS THERE ON THE PACIFIC COAST EXCEPT IN LOS ANGELES ANYTHING THAT APPROACHES THE EXTRAORDINARY TEAM WORK DONE IN BOSTON AND PHILADELPHIA I E THE COOPERATION OF SPECIALISTS IN MEDICINE OCULISTS AURISTS NEU ROLOGISTS AND DENTISTS WITH THE SOCIAL WORKERS THE PROBATION OFFI CERS AND THE PUBLIC HOSPITALS THE STATE BOARD OF HEALTH OF CALIFORNIA HAS MADE GONORRHEA AND SYPHILIS REPORTABLE THE SAME AS OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES IT HAS THE DISTINCTION OF BEING THE FIRST STATE TO INAUGURATE SUCH A MEASURE WHEN IT IS CONSIDERED HOW MANY INNOCENT ONES SUF FER THROUGH THIS DISEASE IT IS APPALLING AND TOO MUCH CANNOT BE SAID OF THE NECESSITY OF ENLIGHTENMENT TO AVERT THE EVIL IN THE FUTURE IT IS CERTAIN THAT IGNORANCE OF THE INFECTIOUS NATURE OF SEXUAL DISEASES ON THE PART OF THE GROWING YOUNG MAN AND THE FALSE BELIEF THAT HIS PHYSICAL WELLBEING REQUIRES SEXUAL GRATI FICATION ARE THE PRINCIPAL CAUSES FOR HIS DOWNFALL GRANDIN STATES IT STRONGLY MAN LARGELY THROUGH IGNORANCE OF THE CALAMITIES FOLLOWING THE MISUSE OF THIS THE REPRODUCTIVE INSTINCT HAS CONVERTED IT INTO ONE FOR THE EXTERMINATION OF THE SPECIES BUT BY FAR THE MOST POTENT AGENTS IN THE CONTINUANCE OF THE EVIL ARE THE IMPERFECT LAWS WHICH LICENSE PROSTITUTION AND REQUIRE EXAMINATION OF THE WOMEN PROSTITUTES ONLY ALLOWING MEN TO GO FREE IN VIEW OF THE INFECTIOUS NATURE OF SEXUAL DISEASES EX 335 9ITHE ANNATS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY TERMINATION OF THESE DISEASES CAN NEVER BE EXPECTED NOR EVEN LESSENED WITH SUCH LAWS IT IS TRUE A RECENT REMEDY 606 OR SALVARGAN CLAIMS TO CURE SYPHILIS WHETHER THIS WILL COUNTERACT THE FEAR OF INFECTION REMAINS TO BE SEEN IT IS QUITE CERTAIN THAT THOUGH THERE IS A REMEDY FOR DIPHTHERIA AND RABIES IT IS NOT CONSIDERED A GOOD REASON FOR EXPOSING ONESELF TO THESE DIS EASES ANOTHER SOURCE OF DANGER TO THE YOUNG MAN IN ENCOURAGING SEXUAL GRATIFICATION IS THE USE OF ALCOHOL DR PRINCE MORROW OF NEW YORK WHO HAS STUDIED THE SUBJECT SAYS PERHAPS MORE THAN ANY OTHER AGENCY ALCOHOL RELAXES THE MORAL SENSE WHILE IT STIMULATES THE SEXUAL IMPULSE IT IS ENCOURAGING TO NOTE IN THIS CONNECTION THAT IN CALI FORNIA 200 SALOONS WERE CLOSED DURING I9I0 THAT 68 PRECINCTS OUT OF 74 VOTED DRY THAT THERE ARE 170 TOWNS AND 65 IN CORPORATED CITIES FROM WHICH THE TRAFFIC HAS BEEN BANISHED ELEVEN COUNTIES ARE DRY AND LOS ANGELES BARS THE SALOON FROM II BLOCKS IN THE BUSINESS CENTER CALIFORNIA IS GIVEN THE CREDIT OF HAVING THE MOST EFFECTIVE SCHOOL LAW PASSED IN I909 OF ANY STATE REGARDING HEALTH MEASURES AN EDUCATOR ESPECIALLY AWAKE TO THE NECESSITY FOR HEALTHFUL CONDITIONS OF THE SCHOOLROOM WELL SAYS THE SCHOOLS FURNISH AN UNRIVALLED OPPORTUNITY FOR DETECT ING AND CHECKING DISEASE AND DEFECTS AMONG CHILDREN IT WILL BE ONLY A MATTER OF A SHORT TIME IT IS HOPED BEFORE MEDICAL INSPECTION WILL BE IN EVERY SCHOOL THE BUBONIC PLAGUE IN CALIFORNIA THE TRUTH CONCERNING WHICH THE DAILY PRESS HAS FALSELY CONCEALED FROM THE PUBLIC HAS YET TO BE FOUGHT IN THE LIGHT OF PRESENT KNOWLEDGE ITS ABSOLUTE ERADI CATION IN THE STATE DEPENDS UPON EXTERMINATION OF THE GROUND SQUIRREL THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTYFIVE CASES OF PLAGUEINFECTED SQUIRRELS WERE FOUND IN THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING JUNE 30 I9IO IN THE COUNTIES OF ALAMEDA CONTRA COSTA MONTEREY MERCED SAN BONITO SANTA CLARA SANTA CRUZ STANISLAUS AND SAN LUIS OBISPO THERE WAS A DEATH OF ONE HUMAN REPORTED IN JUNE I9IO DUE UNDOUBTEDLY TO INFECTION BY SQUIRREL FLEAS THE ORIGIN OF THE EPIDEMIC IN I908 WAS SUPPOSED TO BE OF FOREIGN IMPORTATION NOW IT IS KNOWN THAT THE INFECTED SQUIRRELS WERE THE CAUSE FED ERAL OFFICERS ARE STILL WATCHING THE SEAPORTS AND THE EXTERMINA TION OF RATS GOES ON OREGON FORTUNATELY HAS NEVER HAD AN 336 92PUBLIC HEALTH MOVEMENT ON PACIFIC COAST INVASION OF BUBONIC PLAGUE DUE PROBABLY TO THE FACT THAT IT HAS NO EASILY ACCESSIBLE SEAPORTS AS IN WASHINGTON AND CALIFORNIA WASHINGTON HAS HAD NO PLAGUE AMONG MEN FOR OVER TWO YEARS AND ONLY ONE IN RATS EARLY IN I9I0 THE WORK OF DESTROYING RATS HAS BEEN CONTINUED BY THE UNITED STATES PUBLIC HEALTH AND MARINE HOSPITAL SERVICE SINCE THE APPEARANCE OF PLAGUE THERE IN I907 WASHINGTON PROFITED BY THE DISASTROUS EXPERIENCE OF CALIFORNIA IN I903 AND BY ENERGETIC MEASURES PROMPTLY AND EFFECTIVELY CHECKED THE OUTBREAK IT TOO REALIZES THE DANGER THAT MAY COME TO IT THROUGH THE INFECTED GROUND SQUIRREL OF CALIFORNIA BESIDES BUBONIC PLAGUE THE OTHER ORIENTAL DISEASES LEPROSY TRACHOMA PELLAGRA BERIBERI AMOEBIASIS AND HOOKWORM ARE BEING CAREFULLY WATCHED BY THE HEALTH AUTHORITIES OF THE SEA PORTS CANCER AND POLIOMYELITIS MISCALLED INFANTILE PARALYSIS FOR ADULTS ARE ALSO VICTIMS THE CAUSE OF WHICH SCIENCE HAS NOT YET DISCOVERED CONTINUE THEIR DEADLY WORK HERE AS ELSEWHERE CALIFORNIA TAKES GREAT SATISFACTION IN THE COMPARATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF DEATHS AMONG INFANTS FROM DYSINTERIC AND DIARRHOEAL TROUBLES THE COOL SUMMERS ON THE COAST AND THE ABSENCE OF HUMIDITY IN THE INTERIOR ARE THE BENEFICENT AGENTS LESSENING THESE ENTERIC DISEASES OF CHILDREN WHILE THE HYGIENIC LABORATORIES OF THE PACIFIC COAST ARE DO ING EFFECTIVE WORK THEY ARE MUCH HANDICAPPED FOR FUNDS THE DEATH RATE FROM TYPHOID BASED ON THE CENSUS OF I9I0 IS 20 PER OO00000 IN CALIFORNIA APPROXIMATELY ONLY TWOTHIRDS OF THE UNITED STATES RATE OREGON AND WASHINGTON ARE ALSO AS YET UNABLE TO CONTROL THEIR WATER SUPPLY AND DISPOSAL OF SEWAGE IN RURAL DISTRICTS SO THAT TYPHOID STILL CONTINUES ITS RAVAGES A WOEFUL FACT IN THIS ENLIGHTENED AGE THE CALIFORNIA STATE HEALTH BULLETIN IN THE NOVEMBER NUM BER OF I9IO CONSIDERS THE NECESSITY OF A COMPULSORY SANITARY PRIVY LAW OR ORDINANCE TO BE STRICTLY ENFORCED IN ALL LOCALITIES IN WHICH CONNECTION WITH A SEWER SYSTEM IS NOT ENFORCED THERE IS ALSO PRESENTED A PLAN FOR A SANITARY PRIVY SO CLEAR IN DETAIL THAT ANY I4YEAROLD BOY OF AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE AND MECHAN ICAL INGENUITY COULD BUILD IT THERE FOLLOWS MINUTE DIRECTIONS FOR KEEPING IT CLEAN AND HOW TO DISPOSE OF THE EXCRETA TO PRE VENT POLLUTION OF DRINKING WATER AND VEGETABLES EATEN UNCOOKED THE PLAYGROUND MOVEMENT HAS BEEN ENTHUSIASTICALLY TAKEN 337 93THE ACNNALS OF THE AM4CRICAN ACADEMY UP IN WASHINGTON AND CALIFORNIA OREGON PROVIDES EACH SCHOOL WITH 200 FEET SQUARE OF PLAYGROUND THE PLAYGROUNDS ARE SUPER VISED BY VOLUNTARY ATTENDANTS THERE BEING NO SALARIED EMPLOYEES CALIFORNIA HAS THE DISTINCTION OF HAVING THE FIRST STATE PLAY GROUND ASSOCIATION THE OBJECT OF THE STATE ASSOCIATION IS TO PROMOTE THE PLAYGROUND MOVEMENT IN ALL ITS PHASES THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO PROMOTE OUTDOOR LIFE TO SUPERVISE PLAYS AND TO COOPERATE WITH SCHOOL AUTHORITIES IN A MORE SPIRITED USE OF ALL THE PLAYGROUNDS THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND THE NORMAL SCHOOLS HAVE ESTABLISHED PLAYGROUND COURSES IN THEIR SUMMER SCHOOLS THE SOCIETY SEEKS TO ESTABLISH A SPIRIT OF FREE PLAY OF FAIR PLAY AND OF MORE PLAY AND TO EDUCATE THE COMMON WEALTH TO THE WORTH OF STRONGER BOYS AND GIRLS IN APRIL I9I0 THE STATE BOARD OF HEALTH CALLED A CONFER ENCE OF THE WELFARE ORGANIZATIONS OF CALIFORNIA TO MEET AT SACRA MENTO THE RESULT OF THIS MEETING WAS THE ORGANIZATION OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC HEALTH LEAGUE ITS PURPOSE IS STATED IN THE CONSTITUTION TO BE THE COORDINATION OF EFFORT AND THE PROMOTION OF ECONOMY AND HARMONY AMONG ALL PUBLIC HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS AND AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA THUS CORRELATING THE IMPORTANT WORK OF THE MANY ORGANIZATIONS WORKING TO UPBUILD CALIFORNIAS STAND ARDS OF HEALTH AND HAPPINESS THE HEARTINESS WITH WHICH THE LEAGUE IS ACCEPTED PROMISES WELL FOR THE ULTIMATE WORKING OUT OF ITS PURPOSES THE BULLETINS SENT OUT BY THE STATE BOARD OF HEALTH OF CALIFORNIA DESERVE ESPECIAL MENTION BECAUSE THEY SHOW A DECIDED STEP IN ADVANCE IN THEIR SCOPE AND SUBJECTMATTER THIS PAPER WOULD NOT BE COMPLETE WITHOUT AT LEAST AN ENUMERATION OF THE WELFARE ORGANIZATIONS NOT BEFORE MENTIONED AND WHICH ARE STRONG ALLIES IN HEALTHCONSERVATION WORK STATE CHARITIES AID AND CORRECTION ORGANIZATION CALIFORNIA PUBLIC PRESS CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF MUNICIPALITIES CALIFORNIA TEACH ERS ASSOCIATION VOMENS

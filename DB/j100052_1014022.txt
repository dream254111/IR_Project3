FINANCIAL FALLACIES BY BASIL P BLACKETT CB Of the British Treasury I took a solitary walk last Sunday in Rock Creek Park and as I walked I began to ponder on what I had to say in this paper The sun was warm and after a while I sat down by the bubbling stream on a rustic bench when suddenly I saw approaching me one of the famous bankers who have taken service at the Treasury during the war The fact that he was on foot has made me wonder since whether it was a dream Fortunately I refrained from hailing him for just then there appeared from the opposite direction a figure which I knew somehow to be King Solomon He was not gorgeously arrayed and was evidently warsaving but there was no mistaking the regal presence and the intellectual brow My friend the bankerfor some queer reason my memory fails now to identify him with any particular one of the several eminent bankers at the Treasury so that in a way he seems to be an embodiment of them allrecognized King Solomon at once and called joyfully to him  My dear King This is indeed a pleasure youre just the man I wanted to see The perplexities of war finance and the problems which confront the United States Treasury are gigantic Were asked to find 20000000000 or more in a year and we must borrow some 12000000000 to 15000000000 in the next eight or nine months I simply dont know how the money is to be raised You were dead right King when you said that money is the root of all evil Good friend replied King Solomon you know more of banking than of Scripture or you would know I never said that I may indeed have said that matrimony is the root of all evil It was in my own case and I fancy that my mothers first husband the Hittite must have felt the same But let me suggest to you a new version of the proverb you misquote It is this Thinking in terms of money is the root of most of your evils I think you agree 207THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY Solomon is always right replied the banker with a bow Undoubtedly our problem is not merely or even mainly to raise the money What we want for carrying on our part in this great war for democracy against Tyranny    Pray do not consider my feelings Solomon interrupted Im a strong supporter of democratic principles now They might not have worked in Jerusalem when I was there but one of my reasons for meeting you today was that I hope that this war may be the means of bringing the blessings of liberty and justice to my poor old Jerusalem No offense meant said the banker What I was saying was that when we say we are asked to spend 20000000000 in the first year of the war we really mean that we have to secure for the use of the United States government for war purposes labor mate rials food commodities and services such as those rendered by sol diers and sailors and by noncombatants too in all sorts of ways we have to secure goods and services to use a convenient short phrase which valued in terms of dollars represent 20000000000 The real problem is not so much to find the money as to find a surplus of goods and services to that amount available for the pur poses of the government over and above the goods and services which the 100000000 people of the United States are employing for their own private purposes Thats what you mean by your phrase about thinking in terms of money isnt it You take my meaning exactly And what I suggest to you as the only possible solution of your financial problems is that you should make the people of the country understand the state of the case None of them understands what twenty billions of dollars means You yourself probably dont go much beyond visualizing it as the figure twenty with the dollar sign before and followed by a comma and nine ciphers neatly divided by commas into sets of three Meanwhile theres one of your friends in Wall Street who owns common stock in half a dozen sound American concerns valued six months ago at market prices at say 1000000 and now valued at 700000 who thinks he is ruined and says the govern ment has ruined him and never stops to reflect that the stock in question represents a share in certain real things such as buildings machinery and raw materials which are probably not less valuable and possibly more valuable in terms of money at any rate than they 208THINKING IN TERMS OF MONEY were six months ago And whats worse some of your banker friends who ought to know better seem to think in the same slipshod way Others cry that the great thing to do is to keep money circu lating because it is good for tradebusiness as usual Other people cry out for conscription of wealth as a solution of all troubles as if a house in Fifth Avenue or a bank in Chicago could be put on wheels and sent to France for use as a tank or the Pennsylvania Railway Companys tracks could be torn up bodily and transported to Russia without anyone but the supposed millionaires who own them being any the worse If you believe in democracy you are at any rate not a Socialist I am glad to see said the banker Dont you be too sure my friend rejoined the King It depends on definition But to continue the thing to do is to get the people of this country to understand that money is merely a symbol recognized by civilized people for their own convenience as giving the owner of it for the time being a call on other people the power of getting other people to work for him the power to com mand goods and services which other people are able and willing to supply in order that by receiving a reward in money they may themselves have command of what they need for their daily suste nance and to keep a roof over their heads or over what they desire to obtain for the sake of comfort and luxury It is quite easyas some of your friends the Socialists will gladly explainto construct a theoretical state of society in which money would be abolished No doubt it is broke in the banker but would it work I did not express any opinion was the reply But does not the fact that it is theoretically possible to dispense with money prove that money is merely a mechanical devise and nothing more devised to keep a machine of a particular construction in easy working order At this point King Solomon took a watch from his pocket and remarked that he could still spare a little time longer before starting off to advise the King of the Arabians on military matters He suggested that they could continue their talk more comfortably seated and I was a little alarmed when they made for my bench which was not meant for more than two Needlessly as it proved for in spite of King Solomons ample proportions the small seat accommodated them both without my being so much as observed 209THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADIMY King resumed the banker thats a fine watch of yours but I notice you wear only a common cord as a chain The watch is an heirloom Solomon answered It belonged to the Queen of Shebas grandfather and I could not get a tithe of its value if I sold it But my heavy gold chain went more than a year ago to swell the gold at the Bank of France and I gave the proceeds to relieve the Armenian sufferers The banker looked as if he would like to pay a tribute to this generosity but stopped short no doubt from a sense of reverence Instead he resumed the discussion with the words You do not of course suggest that we could or should supersede money in arrang ing the finance of the war Certainly not was the reply But keep money and finance in their proper place as useful bits of machinery and meanwhile go out to the people and explain the facts That is a big undertaking said Mr Banker Do you think it is really worth while Surely surely said Solomon If you want to accomplish what you have set out to do that is the only possible method in this country In Germany there has been no need to explain The people have been dragooned into saving if only by the British blockade which has forced the whole population to organize itself on a war basis There everyone has to serve in such a way as the Junkers think most likely to help them in conducting the war producing all he or she can and consuming only what is absolutely essential to keep body and soul together and sometimes less In France and Italy and to some extent in Great Britain similar neces sity has been at work and this has been reinforced on one side by continual lessons and appeals for patriotic selfdenial and on the other by drastic legislation prohibiting the import and manufacture of anything that could be done without Nearly everyone in these countries has realized this truth Do you not remember the Song of the Pennies which the children sing in England With five pounds the cost of a rifle Why what can a poor penny do And then the chorus in which Sergeant Shilling joins We are each small enough it is true Theres little a penny can do But a cartridge to fire from a rifle Is just what a penny can do 210THINKING IN TERMS OF MONEY All over the world the children learn this truth at once Last Christmas Mr Lloyd George received a letter from Arizona which said Please sir Peggy is eight and baby is five and I am ten and we should like these five dollars to be used to give some of the poor suffering people in England a happy Christmas There was a further note from their mother This is entirely their own idea Their uncle gave them a dollar each to buy themselves Christmas presents and they have saved the other two And next to the children the working girls have been the quickest to learn The mill worker of Milan the midinette of Paris the munition worker in London have been among the first to see how they can help Each of them has worked harder and earned money not to spend on herself but to lend to her country so that the government may have the wherewithal to buy cartridges and handgrenades to protect the lives of their boys at the front Many of them have understood well enough that the money they lent to the nation came back to them as wages to pay for the cartridges they were making and that by not spending it on themselves they were setting labor and mate rials free to be used to help on the war Do you remember the poster advertising the British War Savings Certificates One hundred and twentyfour cartridges for 15s 6d and your money back with compound interest Yes said the banker Ive seen specimens of that poster and it certainly concentrates the appeal for savings into a very compact and alluring sentence Were thinking of issuing some thing on the lines of those British War Savings Certificates here An admirable plan was Solomons comment I congratulate you These hectic liberty loan campaigns whirlwind weeks during which every art is employed to make everyone eat and drink and work and play and dream to the tune of Buy a Bond are wonderful events and by the way I must congratulate the Treasury through you on its remarkable achievements this last month But these campaigns have their disadvantages Thats so said my friend the banker with conviction They use one up terribly and they upset the market a good deal I was not thinking so much of that answered King Solo mon You mention some of the objections but the main disad vantages to my mind are that they encourage people to think in terms of money and as soon as the campaign is over people settle 211THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY down to their old habits of extravagance What I like about the War Savings Certificate is that the campaign goes on continuously and involves something deeper than a passing emotion People get the habit of daily saving and the incentive to go on saving because there is always a form of war loan which they can buy and there is no temptation to borrow money to subscribe and then forgetfulness to save to pay off what was borrowed But my time is nearly up Let me tell you a story before I go You remember the victory loan campaign in Great Britain last January and Feb ruary when 5000000000 of new money was raised after two and onehalf years of war quite apart from the fact that some 1500000000 to 2000000000 of three to fiveyear bonds were converted into longterm loans I must begin by apologizing for the misuse of language in this story It arises from a habit I have of accurately reproducing conversations One evening Robinson a war loan worker was sitting in his club after a hard days work when an acquaintance of his Smith came up and introduced a third man Jones Robinson knew Smith to be on the stock ex change and gathered that Jones was also a member He knew nothing of their monetary position The talk soon turned to the war loan and Smith remarked that he had not made up his mind yet what he would do He had he said taken 10000 of the four and onehalf per cent war loan in July 1915 and been badly stunga slang term which implies that his investment had not been wholly satisfactory So I judge from Robinsons rejoinder that a man who had invested in that loan had no need to complain as he could now convert it into the new loan on very satisfactory terms Yes I know said Smith but I got so sick with the way the bally thing fell and the idiotic government did nothing to help that I sold it and bought some American rails and now the robbers are commandeering these and Ive two sons at the front too Theres no gratitude in these confounded politicians By this time Rob inson was fairly roused and he proceeded in half an hours patient exposition and exhortation to give a masterly display in securing a difficult subscriber In the end Smith seemed deeply impressed I never saw it in that light he concluded and Im hanged if I wont take 50000 Ill have to borrow the lot at my bankers and Ive an overdraft already but from what you say I think I can square them 212THINKING IN TERMS OF MONEY All this time Jones had said little though he had seemed to be listening attentively Flushed with his success with Smith Rob inson now turned to Jones But he could get nothing more out of him than that he had considered all the means available to him and had reluctantly decided that he could not subscribe Six months later in the same club Smith and Robinson met again You made a fine fool of me that night said Smith Just let me tell you what a mess you got me into Ive had the most ghastly day of my life today I was offered a half share in a part nership to develop a new ruby mine somewhere in Asia Its the chance of a lifetime Only 100000 wanted We cant float a company till after the war because this sickening government wont let anyone issue new capital unless it chooses in its wisdom to say the issue will help to win the war Well I said I was on and I went over to my bankers to arrange things when the manager said he was sorry but he couldnt increase my overdraft and had the cheek to suggest that I ought by now to have paid off some of what they lent me to take up your blessed loan He wouldnt lend me money on any of my other securities without being told what I wanted it for and when I told him he said that the bank could not advance money which was to go abroad or for a purpose which was so obviously not necessary for winning the war And then not content with these insults he proceeded to suggest that people with much smaller means than mine had succeeded in paying off very big sums borrowed for subscribing to the loan and would I please consider the matter seriously I was so angry that I told him to sell the bally war loan for what it would fetch and be done with it He didnt like it he said but if I was really determined to forget that we were at war it was probably the best thing I could do By this time I was so infuriated that I said I would close my account and find a bank where the managers were gentlemen or at least taught to behave like gentlemen I went straight across to my friend Brownyou know the bank Well Im hanged if Brown didnt tell me that he thought my bank had been remarkably pa tientthat in any case he could not help me as the London banks had agreed not to take customers from one another if the reason for the change of bankers was that a customer had failed to get accommodation for a purpose which was obviously not useful to 213THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY the war So here I am absolutely dished Ive had to say I cant go half shares in this show with the result that the whole things off Ive quarrelled badly with my bankers and altogether Im in a fix Coals a staggering price and Ive just added two new palm houses to the glass I have to keep going Ive two sons in the army and I might at least claim that amount of luxury Incidentally Ive only managed to keep my head gardener who thinks he ought to enlist by threatening to turn his wife out of his cottage if he does Hes fortyfive and has two sons at the front and ought to be ashamed of himself and with the wages Im paying him hes a regular millionaire Why he told me hed got over sixty War Sav ings Certificates now Well you deserved this tirade you know as youre the scoundrel at the bottom of it all I must be off now as my sons coming up from Aldershot and were going to paint the town red to drown our troubles So long  Scarcely had Smith gone when Robinson saw Jones approach ing He tried not to be seen as he thought that he couldnt bear to talk with another of his failures that day But Jones made his way quickly to him Hullo Robinson he began I suppose youre not particularly anxious to renew my acquaintance after the way I met your war loan appeal The fact is you made me feel thoroughly mean that night but I couldnt help myself Ive something better to tell you today and thats why Ive ventured to speak to you Id have liked to do it before but I didnt have the courage The fact is I used to have a pretty good business in the American department of the stock exchange but thats gone altogether because of what the governmentquite rightly of course had to do about American securities Then just when I was hoping to get our house let so that we could move into a cheaper one our two boys got killed on July 1 1916 the first day of the Battle of the Somme The shock was too much for Mrs Jones and she had a complete nervous breakdown and we had to have two nurses in the house and no end of expense for special treatment and spe cialiststhough I must say my doctor has been a brick about his own account The result was that last February I had got rid of practically all my capital except the 4 per cent war loan Id bought and I had an overdraft of nearly 600 at the bank I was earning something at the Ministry of Munitions where I had got a really useful job But I had refused to take anything much by way of 214THINKING IN TERMS OF MONEY salary when I had enough without and I didnt think it fair to make the country pay because of my new troubles Thank goodness things are quite easy now My wifes recovered Weve shut up all but two rooms in our house and my wifes as happy as can be in saving for the sake of the other mothers sons Shes a great woman though I say it that shouldnt And youve no idea how jolly it is The wife got places for two of the maids at the muni tions factory near us and sometimes they drop in to tea with us on Saturdays and tell us about their work and talk of what theyll do when the wars over Did I tell you that the wifes promised to have them back And the kitchen maids working as conductor with the omnibus company and she and I have a chat sometimes when I happen to come down to work on her bus Well the result of it all is that Ive paid off the bank overdraft and theyve lent me enough to buy 500 of your war loan in the market and thats partly paid off and all of us Mrs Jones and our old servants and I are members of a War Savings Association in our neighborhood and were piling up War Savings Certificates So I feel that I can look you in the face again   Eh well so long Its good of you to say such nice things of our small efforts but were really trying to help you know Robinsons effort to restrain Jones from flying from his praises proving vain he sat for awhile and pondered on the two cases But I need not tell you his conclusions Im afraid my storys rather long already said Solomon And now I fear I must hurry As neither King Solomon nor the banker explained the conclusions to be drawn from the two cases I do so though with diffidence I suppose they would be something like the following Smith had at best merely put his own and his bankers credit at the disposal of the government on false pretences for a few months during which someone else such as Jones had been able to build up new savings with which to replace the gap left when Smith sold his loan More probably he had compelled the gov ernment to find 50000 in June to wipe out by means of the special war loan depreciation fund the fictitious credit based as it proved on no real goods and services which Smith in a moment of shallow emotion had allowed the govern ment to build upon On the other hand Jones in six months had 1 Saved 600 to repay his bank thereby 2 Setting goods and services to that amount free for the government 3 Undertaken to save a further 500 and already saved part of it 215THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY off or I shall be late in Arabia The connections are not good I find in these days though Im glad to say that Beersheba Junction is open again Goodybye my friend And with that he vanished and the banker somehow disap peared too But I noticed that a fly leaf had dropped from King Solomons pocketbook and when I picked it up I found it covered with all sorts of odd sentences in a minute handwriting of which I quote a few He that gathereth not scattereth abroad  Every dollar saved helps twice first when it is saved and again when it is lent to the nation  Millions in the belligerent lands have for the first time an oppor tunity of laying by a little capital It is the chance of generations Will they not take it They help their country and themselves by saving If man would but learn the duty of right spending he would learn the greatest pleasure in the world There were other sentences also which I did not decipher But I particularly noticed that on each side of the fly leaf there was printed in red letters a sentence which evidently appeared in a similar place on each leaf of the note book from which it came and the sentence was this Where there is no Vision the People perisheth 4 Lent the 500 to the government for war purposes on the security of his intention to save backed by the banks credit thereby 5 Giving the government command over goods and services to the full extent to which the selfdenial of the Jones family was setting goods and services free and 6 Had evidently been exercizing an untold influence for good in aiding others to find fit places in a nation organized for war B P B 216

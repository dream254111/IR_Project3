j100168,Harvard Law Review,1321633,Ex Post Facto Laws and the Police Power,i256848,Ex POST FACTO LAWS AND THE POLICE POWER A New York statute provides that no person shall practise medicine in the State wno has ever been convicted of a felony The Court of Appeals in People v Hawker 46 N E Rep 607 has recently held that the statute applies to persons convicted before its passage and that as to such of them at least as were not engaged in the practice of medicine at the time of its passage it is not invalid as an ex post facto law The court holds that the statute does not prescribe an additional penalty for a past offence but is an eminently justifiable exercise of the police power in the interests of the public health The decision is interesting in the light of the well known Test Oath cases Cummings v State of Missouri 4 Wall 277 and Ex parte Garland ib 333 decided by the Supreme Court in I866 In the former the question was as to the constitutionality of a provision in the Missouri Constitution of I865 to the effect that all persons who had ever given assistance to the enemies of the Union should be disqualified as voters and forbidden to hold office or engage in certain professions The court held that this provision was void as an ex post facto law In Ex parte Garland a similar Act of Congress was declared unconstitu tional In both cases the question was raised by a person who was in the actual practice as one of the proscribed professions when the law was passed and who had been forced to abandon it By way of dicta how ever the court sweepingly condemns the laws in question as applied to all persons Four judges dissented in each case on the ground taken by the Court of Appeals in People v Hawuiker supra that the laws merelyANOTES 117 prescribed legitimate qualifications for those who wished to practise cer tain professions and did not impose a new penalty for a past crime Tlhere is good ground for contending that the dissenters in those cases took the correct view And in the New York case where the qualifica tion required was nmuch more intimately connected with fitness for the profession there can be small doubt but that a correct result was reached It may perhaps be questioned whether the laws involved in any of these cases are any more open to the objection of being ex post facto when applied to a person at the time practising one of the forbidden pro fessions than they are when applied to one not yet in practice Though this distinction is taken by Pomneroy Constitutional Law  530533 who supports the actual decisions in the Test Oath cases while disagree ing with much that was said by Mr Justice Field in the course of his opinion The whole question would seem to be whether the law is in substance the infliction of an additional punishment for a past offence or a bona fide regulation of a calling in which the public has a deep interest If the latter it seems clear from Dent v West Virginia 129 U S II4 that it is valid as to existing practitioners as well as other persons

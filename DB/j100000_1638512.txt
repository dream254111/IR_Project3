Professor J McKeen Cattell Garrison onHudson N Y THE CARNEGIE INSTITUTION OF WASHINGTON1 PRESENT STATUS OF THE INSTITUTION ALTHOUGH the institution is quite young and must be considered as still to some extent in its formative stages this first year of the second decade of its history marks an epoch worthy of something more than passing notice During this year to a degree hitherto impracticable there has been opportunity for an objective view of the meaning of the extensive and varied experience acquired by the institution of the principles which have guided its devel opment and of the limitations difficulties and dangers which may beset its future progress During this year also to a greater degree than hitherto have ap peared evidences from widely divergent sources of an increasing public tendency to take an objective view of the plan scope organization and development of the insti tution and to measure its efficiency by the results of its investigations already pub lished or under way From these objective views it appears that in spite of a great diversity of opinion as to what research is and how it should be carried on a di versity which seems destined to continue indefinitely there is now a consensus of opinion that the institution has established its position and demonstrated the practica bility of the conduct of effective research in establishments wholly devoted thereto separate and apart from other establish ments whose functions are primarily and commendably agricultural charitable com Extracts from the report of the president for the year ending October 31 1912 tL N S VOL XXXVII No 948 mercial educational governmental polit ical religious or social Thus in general it may be said that as regards internal and external relations and interrelations the institution in its chosen field of activity has now reached a status approximating to stability of adjustment wherein definite ness of aim continuity of effort and con centration of energy and resources may be more productively applied than heretofore But while the work proper of the insti tution namely work of research is in a satisfactory condition as much may not be said of the adventitious work incident espe cially to the administrative office For although this latter work is sometimes in structive and occasionally useful it is gen erally fruitless and often excessively waste ful of time and energy which might other wise be turned to better account This work involves a vast correspondence con cerning an endless variety of subjects and particularly concerning an endless variety of objects for which funds might be spent In its higher phases it is the work of an intelligence office and may be accepted as a not unworthy though unintended function of the institution in its lower phases it is in need of curtailment in the interests alike of all concerned The time for a detailed or even sum mary account of this highly complex and to some extent psychologically important experience has not yet arrived Such an account must be left to historians inter ested in the evolution of institutions or to analysts like De Morgan in search of a mine of materials for a new Budget of Paradoxes It is plainly the part of wis dom however not to wait for verdicts of the historian and the analyst but to make use of such inductions as may be safely drawn not only from the experience just referred to but also from that gained in the work proper to the institution Most of the theories ideas and sentiments in volved are subject to the tests of statistical treatment which determine with sufficient accuracy the more fruitful methods of pro cedure Of the many inductions which may be thus drawn out of the experience of the institution a few may be here set down as indicative of existing conditions and tendencies It is in evidence 1 That there are the amplest room and the amplest opportunity for research es tablishments without danger of encroach ment on establishments founded for other purposes that it is not difficult for the institution to find appropriate ways in which to apply its income that there are in fact in plain sight ten times as many worthy practicable subjects of research and ten times as many worthy investiga tors as the income of the institution can advantageously subsidize 2 That there are many investigations of such magnitude and difficulty that they can not be carried on economically and effectively except by men untrammeled by other occupations The common notion that research demands only a portion of ones leisure from more absorbing duties tends to turn the course of evolution back wards and to land us in the amateurism and the dilettantism wherein science finds its beginnings 3 That it is inimical alike to the inter ests of society and to those of the institu tion to look upon it as a mere disbursing agency designed to meet emergencies or to supply deficiencies of other institutions and of individuals The widely spread impressions that the income of the institu tion is sufficient to meet the aggregate of such emergencies and deficiencies and that the institution can undertake to play the role of a special providence and thus an ticipate the collective needs of deserving 314 SCIENCESCIENCE individuals and organizations have no foundations in fact 4 That while there may be wisdom in a multitude of counsels it becomes increas ingly difficult of access as the multitude enlarges and is generally obscured if not hidden by a conflict of opinions The cur rent popular impression that discoveries and advances may be favorably promoted by the patient examination of a vast ag gregate of miscellaneous suggestions is a fallacy abundantly demonstrated by the probably unequaled data available to the institution 5 That it is neither practicable nor ad vantageous for the institution to under take to perfect inventions to secure letters patent for them to defend inventors in suits at law or to exploit successful inven tions The objects of the inventor are pri marily egoistic and hence secretive the objects of the institution are primarily al truistic and hence nonsecretive their di vergence is so great as to render them mutually exclusive under existing condi tions The distinction between invention and investigation is rarely understood and is not always easily drawn They are in deed closely allied for the inventor is often compelled to make investigations and the investigator is often compelled to devise inventions It should be said also that the egoism of the inventor which leads him to secretiveness and to seek state privileges through patent rights has its correlative in the desire of the investigator to secure pri ority of discovery and publication The distinction is one of reversed attitudes and objects The inventor is primarily inter ested in direct personal benefits which may come from the application of facts and principles in the perfection of useful de vices machines and processes The inves tigator is primarily interested in the dis covery of facts and principles which may 315 be given freely to the world without expec tation of immediate application or hope of direct personal benefit It is claimed how ever that the party of the second part to be considered in all such matters namely society is in general disproportionately the gainer over both the inventor and the in vestigator The extensive evidence on this subject acquired by the institution shows clearly that the indirect advantages to the investigator arising from his altruism are generally much greater than the direct advantages to the inventor arising from his egoism Tiis evidence is indeed so convincing as to suggest the desirability at some future date of the organization of a department devoted to inventions which instead of being protected by patent rights should be protected if at all against them It is plain in fact that if society could make use of knowledge now available the labors of the expert inventor could become far more fruitful and far more satisfactory to him than they are at present RPISUMi OF INVESTIGATIONS OF THE YEAR Departments of Research It is now nine years since the earliest of the departments of research established by the institution were authorized and six years since the latest of them was author ized This lapse of time has now fully demonstrated that these departments are all engaged in enterprises which by reason of their magnitudes were unlikely to be carried out under other auspices They have grown very rapidly and have become highly productive All of them tend con tinually and in many respects properly to expand as their several fields of investi gation are developed They thus tend con stantly to press closely upon the available income of the institution and hence to be come a source of concern by reason of their highly commendable progress But the FEBRUARY 28 1913N S VOL XXXVII No 948 remedy for this paradox does not lie alone in increased expenditures to an equal ex tent at least it lies in increased efficiency under slowly increasing or even stationary or decreasing expenditures It is a special duty of the man of science to show how more and better work can be done at less cost than has been practicable to his prede cessors Although these departments of investi gation like the institution as a whole have fallen short of popular expectations in the rapidity of their growth it now appears plain in the light of their actual experi ence that this growth has been somewhat too rapid for safety Along with this rapid growth and with the signal success of these departments in their several fields of research there are now coming also numerous requests for cooperation with other organizations and with individuals But while these requests are in general gratifying and often praiseworthy they present some obvious hazards There is need therefore of constant caution against the dangers of undue expansion and affilia tion which lead to dissipation of effort and resources It should be kept in mind that concentration on definitely limited pro grams continuity of effort and energetic assiduity are the factors most essential to progress in the domain of research The plan referred to a year ago of in viting one or two eminent specialists to become associated with each of the depart ments for limited periods of time has thus far worked quite advantageously and promises to become increasingly fruitful Eight such specialists have been connected with the departments during the past year by direct appointment of the executive committee with varying compensations as shown in the financial section of this re port Some other research associates have served without compensation and several collaborators have also partaken in depart mental investigations or availed themselves of departmental facilities without direct expense to the institution As usual in the presidents report ref erence must be made to the departmental reports to be published in full in the cur rent year book for comprehensive accounts of departmental investigations publica tions and plans for future activities as well as for accounts of the work of depart mental associates and collaborators Only the briefest summaries indicating some of the salient features of these accounts are attempted in the following paragraphs Department of Botanical Research The geographical range of the work of this department which centers in the Des ert Laboratory at Tucson Arizona has been extended during the past year to in clude certain portions of the deserts of northern Africa Thus Dr Cannon spent the late autumn and early winter of 1911 12 in the deserts of Algeria while Director MacDougal and his engineer Mr Sykes spent a good share of the winter of 1911 12 in the Lybian deserts These expedi tions enabled the department to acquire extensive information for comparative studies of desert areas and Dr Cannons report on the results of the earlier expedi tion has been already received for publi cation Studies have been continued also at the Desert Laboratory at the Carmel Labora tory on the California coast at Salton Sea and at various substations where observa tions are made on the phenomena presented by plants under strikingly varying condi tions The desiccation of the Salton Sea now under observation presents many in structive conditions which are being care fully studied in their climatic biological and physical aspects It will be practi 316 SCIENCEFEBRUARY 28 1913 cable therefore in the course of a few years to furnish something like a detailed history of this remarkable basin which has now been carefully studied at intervals since its discovery in 1854 by the late Pro fessor N P Blake One of the most important investigations undertaken during the past year is that of a comprehensive study of the large and highly diversified family of cactus plants Through the cooperation of Professor N L Britton director of the New York Botan ical Garden and Dr J N Rose of the staff of the Smithsonian Institution who have been appointed research associates it will be practicable by aid of the facilities of the department to produce a monographic study of these typical desert plants Several volunteer associates and collabo rators of the department have participated in departmental researches and contributed to the progress attained therein Upwards of twenty individuals have taken part in one or more phases of this work Department of Experimental Evolution The advances made by this department during the past yearhave been chiefly along the lines of studies in cytology in the chemistry of pigmentation in the fac tors of mutation and in the problems of human heredity These studies have been carried on by aid of experiments with plants and animals and by aid of rapidly accumulating statistical data concerning human traits and their transmission through successive generations The di rector has been able to give much of his time to studies in human heredity by rea son of his connection with the Eugenics Record Office whose work has been lib erally supported by Mrs E H Harriman and by Mr John D Rockefeller The experiments of the department proper with plants and animals are thus supplemented very advantageously by the extensive in formation already acquired by the Eugen ics Record Office in respect to human heredity Very interesting chemical studies have been carried on by Dr Gortner a member of the staff in respect to the chemical nature of pigments which determine color characteristics especially of the plumage in birds of the wool in sheep and of the skin in men Dr Shull has continued his fertile studies into the heredity of plants in cluding further investigations into the con nection between heredity and environment in the case of corn These further studies confirm his earlier conclusions and show also that the hereditary traits of different strains are maintained irrespective of en vironmental influences The director calls attention to the need of his department for additional buildings and equipments A recommendation with respect to this need will be found in a sub sequent part of this report Department of Economics and Sociology According to the report of Professor Henry W Farnam chairman the work of this department has now reached such a stage of advancement that the time of its completion depends mainly on the amount of leisure the collaborators may obtain in the near future for consecutive attention to their several contributions to the Eco nomic History of the United States By aid of the special appropriation for pay ment of salaries made by the board of trustees a year ago it is now practicable for some of the collaborators to devote part of their time and attention consecutively to this work and two or three of them will doubtless be able to give at least halftime under this plan during the ensuing year SCIENCE 317N S VOL XXXVII No 948 The present status of the investigations of the several divisions of the department is set forth in detail by the chairman in his report The attention of the trustees is especially invited to a paragraph in Professor Far nams report calling attention to the de sirability of a more permanent organiza tion of this department before its present program of research is completed He recommends an organization similar to that of other departments of the institution which would involve the appointment of a salaried director and a permanent staff The experience of the institution leaves no doubt as to the wisdom of this recom mendation on the score of continuity and efficiency for this as well as for other de partments of the institution Further ref erence to this subject will be made in the budget section of this report Geophysical Laboratory The list of twentysix publications which have emanated from the geophysical labo ratory during the past year and which are briefly reviewed by the director in his an nual report furnishes the best index of the activity of this establishment Two specially noteworthy publications of the laboratory have been issued during the year by the institution namely No 157 High Temperature Gas Thermometry and No 158 The Methods of Petro graphicMicroscopic Research The pur pose of the first of these was to give an account of the apparatus and methods for accurate measurement of the critical tem peratures incident to mineral combina tions and the object of the second is to place so far as practicable microscopic study of minerals upon a quantitative basis Attention has hitherto been called to this characteristic feature of the investi gations of the geophysical laboratory which is a characteristic feature of all of the advancing sciences The work already accomplished demonstrates the practica bility of achieving this object for the sci ence of mineralogy This advance requires that special attention be given to accurate measurements of high temperatures and high pressures as well as to their simul taneous effects upon mineral constituents Much study therefore continues to be given by the laboratory staff to the devel opment of effective apparatus and tech nique for the measurements essential in this work Special attention is called in the di rectors report to extended studies on quartz and other forms of silica which is the most widely diffused ingredient in rock masses to further experiments on the con ditions of association of the three oxides lime alumina and silica which in addition to being the commonest components of igneous rocks are also incidentally the three principal ingredients of the so called Portland cement to mineral sul phides which are often of great economic importance and to mineral and rock densities Perhaps the most interesting of the more recent investigations of the laboratory are those of the physics and chemistry of active volcanoes undertaken tentatively a year ago and pursued with very gratifying success during the past summer It has proved practicable for members of the staff to descend into the crater of Kilauea and to collect considerable quantities of gas as it emerged from the liquid lavas of the crater Specimens of gases were collected in glass tubes without contamination from the air and these have been brought to the laboratory at Washington for detailed study There seems little reason to doubt that the phenomena of vulcanism will be ultimately revealed by the methods appa 318 SCIENCEFEBRUARY 28 1913 ratus and technique developed by the staff of the laboratory Department of Historical Research Naturally a department devoted to his torical research is chiefly concerned with the preparation of publications and these latter for the department in question may be classified under the head of reports aids and guides concerning materials relating to American history and under the head of textual publications of documents Under the first head attention may be called to Professor Marion D Learneds Guide to the Manuscript Material relating to Amer ican History in German State Archives No 150 of the publications of the institu tion which has appeared during the year Two other volumes namely publication No 90A Guide to the Materials for American History to 1783 in the Public Record Office of Great Britain and pub lication No 163 Guide to the Materials for the History of the United States in the Principal Archives of Mexico of the institution are now in press No 90A has been somewhat delayed by reason of a re classification to which large sections of the British Public Record Office were sub jected after this work had been started by Professor Andrews Another work in press by the department is Mr David W Parkers Guide to the Materials for United States History in Canadian Ar chives publication No 172 of the insti tution Further progress is reported in respect to the work in charge of Mr W G Leland of the departmental staff on materials for American history in the archives of Paris Search has been made also in several other European cities for sources of American history The director of the department spent the past summer in Europe and took occasion while there to devote special atten tion to the materials derivable from the five Frenchspeaking cantons of Switzer land Assistance has been rendered to the department during the year by several col laborators who have been called by the director to his aid in the preparation of the proposed atlas of historical geography of the United States to which reference has been made in preceding reports Dr Burnett of the departmental staff has been engaged chiefly upon the series of Letters of Delegates to the Continental Congress while Miss Davenport also of the permanent staff has been occupied nearly continuously in the collection of European Treaties having a bearing on United States History These documents promise to furnish much material hitherto inaccessible to students of American his tory Department of Marine Biology The independent transportation facili ties furnished by the staunch new vessel Anton Dohrn and the repairs and im provements to the laboratory completed a year ago have proved highly advantageous to the department of marine biology By means of the Anton Dohrn the entire Gulf and West Indian region becomes open to investigation by the department The di rector records with appreciation a gift to his fleet by Hon John B Henderson of Washington D C of a 23foot 6 horse power launch which has already proved a very useful adjunct in the diversified work of the department since many different investigations are carried on simultane ously by different individuals at the labo ratory headquarters During February and March of the cur rent year the director established a tem porary laboratory at Montego Bay Ja maica a region which sustains important biological relations to the vicinity of the SCIENCE 319N S VOL XXXVII No 948 Tortugas group of islands In addition to the director nine other investigators pur sued researches at this laboratory In May the director and three collaborators visited the Bahamas making a successful cruise of 570 miles with the Anton DohZrn This expedition was of special aid to Messrs Drew and Vaughan in their studies concerning oolite deposits and corals The director of the department has is sued as No 162 of the publications of the institution an additional volume of his series on the jellyfishes of the world the title of this volume being Ctenophores of the Atlantic Coast of North America Sixteen of his collaborators have presented papers for publication which will furnish two more volumes of the Researches from the Tortugas Laboratory Department of Meridian Astrometry After the meridian instrument was brought back from the temporary observa tory at San Luis Argentina to the Dudley Observatory at Albany it was thoroughly reexamined to make certain that it had undergone no change on account of the relatively rough handling it necessarily re ceived during this journey from Argentina to America The reexamination was com pleted about the beginning of the present fiscal year and proved conclusively that the instrument had suffered no damage in any of its parts Along with this good fortune to the department and to the Dudley Ob servatory this instrument thus becomes noteworthy in the annals of astronomy for no meridian circle has been so thoroughly proved to retain its stability under such a variety of varying conditions After the preliminary tests referred to observations with the instrument were begun on Novem ber 13 1911 and have continued through out the year in accordance with the pro gram explained hitherto in the depart mental reports In the meantime special attention has been given to the reduction of the meridian observations made at San Luis Argentina The determination of the two coordinates of stars from this work namely right as cension and declination have proceeded simultaneously The assignment of stellar magnitudes however must await the pho tometric determinations which have been made at San Luis since the meridian meas urements were completed Late advices from Mr Zimmer who has charge of this photometric work announce that it will be completed by the end of the present cal endar year and he and his assistant are expected to return early next year The department reports with great re gret the death on November 19 1911 by accidental drowning of Mr William Hunt who served initially as Mr Zimmers as sistant Mr Hunt was a young man of much promise and his untimely loss was a source of shock to his colleagues and a cause of temporary delay to the photo metric work Much attention has been given by the director of the department and by Mr Benjamin Boss to studies of stellar motions for which the extensive data accumulated by the department are furnishing evidence These studies and those made by the solar observatory of the institution along with corresponding investigations in many other observatories indicate that the progress of astronomy in the future is to be no less brilliant than it has been in the past The great quantity of priceless observa tional and derived data accumulated by the department rendered it imperative that special provision should be made for their safe storage Accordingly the executive committee authorized the department to expend from its last annual allotment the 320 SCIENCESCIENCE sum of 2000 for the construction of a fire proof vault within the walls of the Dudley Observatory This vault is now ready for occupancy and the records will be placed therein as soon as practicable Nutrition Laboratory Although investigations began immedi ately on the establishment of the nutrition laboratory five years ago the novelty and importance of its field have called for con tinuous additions to its equipment while added experience has suggested many im provements in the apparatus used Thus during the past year two balconies have been added to the calorimeter laboratory a treadmill designed to measure severe mus cular work has been provided for a rbspira tion chamber and numerous modifications have been made in the calorimeters and respiration apparatus of the laboratory More detailed studies of the bicycle ergom eter which has hitherto proved so useful in experiments on the metabolism of man during excessive muscular work have ren dered the apparatus available over a wider range of experimentation and with a higher degree of certainty than hitherto The importance and success of the experi ments already undertaken at the labora tory have created a widespread interest in the medical profession and this interest has led to many cooperative investigations undertaken during the past year The novel equipment of the laboratory has been the subject of much inquiry also and many investigators from other laboratories have sought to secure copies of the apparatus used and to learn more of the technique developed by the director and his staff One of the most interesting of the many investigations under way during the year is that of the metabolism of a subject who underwent a prolonged fast extending to thirtyone days without food and who 321 drank only distilled water during this time This investigation required the cooperation of a number of chemical pathological and psychological experts A detailed report on this elaborately observed experiment is at present in preparation Another note worthy investigation of the year is that on metabolism during severe muscular work undertaken by Dr E P Catheart of the University of Glasgow who was a research associate of the institution during the win ter of 191112 Amongst other important results of the latter research is the measure it affords of the mechanical efficiency of man An account of this investigation is likewise in preparation for publication In addition to the numerous papers which have appeared in current journals from the laboratory two volumes Nos 166 and 167 of the institutions series have been issued during the year The first of these is devoted toThe Composition of the Atmosphere with Special Reference to its Oxygen Content and proves the re markable fact of the essential constancy of this element in the atmosphere Department of Terrestrial Magnetism Highly effective progress has been made by this department during the past year in its magnetic survey of the globe By means of the nonmagnetic ship Carnegie it is now easier to make a magnetic survey of the ocean areas than of the land areas for the former are now more readily ac cessible than the latter At the end of the preceding fiscal year the Carnegie was at Batavia Java On November 21 1911 she set sail for an additional circuit of the Indian Ocean whence she proceeded to Manila Philippine Islands where she ar rived February 3 1912 From Manila she proceeded to Suva thence to Tahiti and is now en route to Coronel Chili During the fiscal year she traversed about 28000 FEBRUARY 28 1913N S VOL XXXVII No 948 miles Her courses are arranged to inter sect as frequently as possible her own pre vious tracks those of the Galilee and those of previous expeditions on which magnetic elements were observed Valuable checks on the determinations of these elements are thus secured and in case of considerable intervals between the dates of different determinations data for secular variation of the magnetic elements are also obtained As related in the report of a year ago unexpectedly large errors were found in the best magnetic charts of the Indian Ocean and for some parts of the Pacific Ocean In order that corrections may be speedily applied to such charts the results of the cruises of the Carnegie are promptly made known to the principal hydrographic offices of the world It is expected that the Carnegie will complete her present circum navigation of the world near the end of the next fiscal year Observations have been continued simul taneously on land areas embracing por tions of five continents and about twenty different countries Many noteworthy series of transcontinental stations have now been completed Of these one ex tending across the entire continent of South America beginning at Para at the mouth of the Amazon and extending to Callao on the Pacific coast by way of the Amazon and Ucayali rivers and Lima has been finished during the past year The first volume of researches of the department giving the results of land ob servations from the time of its establish ment in 1905 down to the end of the year 1910 is now in press The final computa tions of the ocean observations made dur ing the various cruises of the Galilee and the Carnegie are also well advanced for a second volume Many improvements in instrumental appliances have been made during the year in response to needs and suggestions arising from the extensive ex perience of the department on land and sea One of the most important of the new appliances devised is that called an earth inductor which permits the measurement of the dip of the magnetic needle with in creased precision and decreased labor over devices previously used An attempt is now being made to apply this apparatus which has proved completely successful on land to the determination of dips on the Carnegie Solar Observatory The past year has been one of minimum sunspot activity but effective progress has been made in many other branches of solar and stellar research undertaken by the ob servatory The wide range of this work may be indicated by the fact that the re sults of the investigations of the year are summarized by the director under thirty five different heads The new tower tele scope has been completed and important auxiliary apparatus has been added to the equipment of the 60inch reflector A fire proof office building which will afford ade quate quarters for the staff and safety for the original records and photographic plates of the observatory has been con structed and made ready for occupancy during the year The 150foot tower telescope with its spectrograph and spectroheliograph has been tested and found to be quite up to expectations The 60inch reflector has proved increasingly effective in the wide variety of work undertaken with it Be tween forty and fifty new spectroscopic double stars have been found and amongst the many stars whose radial velocities have been measured is one which surpasses all other hitherto observed its velocity being about 150 miles per second Two eminent research associates namely SCIENCE 322FEBRUARY 28 1913 Professor Kapteyn of Groningen and Pro fessor Stormer of Christiania have taken part in the work of the observatory during the year Professor Kapteyn who has served in this capacity for several years previously has been of great service to the department especially in the planning of a program of work with the 60inch re flector so that it may yield a maximum return alike for problems of stellar distri bution and stellar development Professor St6rmer who is one of the highest authori ties concerning auroras has sought to de termine especially the connection of these phenomena with the sun Of their con nection with the sun and with the earths magnetism there is little doubt and the recent demonstration of the atomicity of matter in general and the atomic nature of electricity in particular may be confidently expected to lead to distinct advances in our kn6wledge of these phenomena in the near future The laborious task of shaping and test ing the glass disk for the proposed 100 inch telescope has proved a disappointment in showing that this disk which was ac cepted provisionally from the makers sev eral years ago will not answer the require ments At this writing it appears possible that some expedients may be adopted to overcome the instability of this disk but the probability that it may be made to work satisfactorily is small In the mean time the makers of such large disks have not succeeded in making one of sufficient uniformity in density In view of these difficulties the director is disposed to try a thinner disk if one can be found possessing the requisite degree of homogeneity Thus this project must suffer further delay al though it is practically certain that the difficulties presented may be ultimately overcome Investigations of Research Associates and Collaborators The relations of research associates and collaborators of the institution are so di versified and complex that they are diffi cult to specify at any given epoch Indi viduals who have received direct aid dur ing the year to their investigations through grants are mentioned in the preceding financial section of this report Those who have received indirect aid through grants made for the publication of their researches are also mentioned in the section just re ferred to Many collaborators and assist ants have received compensation directly from research associates in charge of in vestigations while some research associates and many collaborators have received no direct compensation It appears to be neither desirable nor practicable at present to seek any higher degree of correlation of this work since it is carried on by many individuals in many different parts of the world The best evidences of the quantity and quality of the results accomplished are to be found in the publications listed in part in a subsequent section of this report and more at length in the general bibliog raphy of the year published in the current year book The work of the year has ex tended to an aggregate of more than twenty different fields of research and has occu pied the attention of more than a hundred investigators Many of these have ren dered special reports to be published in the year book while reference is made to the work of many others in the reports of the larger departments of research FINANCIAL STATEMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 191112 The sources of funds available for ex penditure during the

hypothesis Family SUID2E DINOCHCERUS HOLLANDI gen et sp nov This new genus and species was recently exhumed in the Agate Springs Fossil Quarry by T F Olcott a member of the Carnegie Mu seum field party in this region The type con sists of the greater portion of the skeleton of perhaps one of the most striking animals found thus far in this quarry The animal is closely related to the genus Elotheritm found in the Oligocene formation The dentition is apparently somewhat more specialized than in the latter genus There is only a faint trace of the cingulum on the inferior pre molars This cingulum terminates on the pos terior base of the tooth forming a rather heavy basal heel There is no cingulum on the inferior molars The dentition on the whole is characteristically similar to that of Elotherium as is also the general contour of the skull The limbs are elongated and the general structure of the skeleton recalls that of the Oligocene genus This similarity is of much interest when the changes which have taken place since the Oligocene time in the Oreodontidte and the Camelidse are considered The gigantic size of this Loup Fork species the length of the cranium alone being about 90 cm together with the fact that the re mains are found in a much later geological horizon than that in which Elotherium has been found is thought by the writer to be of sufficient importance pending a more thor ough study of the type to provisionally sepa rate the two forms generically When the material is cleared up a final study of the osteology of the specimen will be made and a detailed description will appear in the publications of the Carnegie Museum 0 A PETERSON CARNEGIE MUSEUM July 31 1905 1The specific name is given in honor of Dr W J Holland the Director and Acting Curator of Paleontology in the Carnegie Museum N S VOL XXII No 555 QUOTATIONS THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE FURTHER investigation has brought to light in the Department of Agriculture additianal transactions that have excited some criticism The grand jury at Washington is still at work upon the offenses of Assistant Statistician Holmes Chief Statistician John Hyde who resigned and at once sailed for Europe has been asked by Secretary Wilson to come back He replies that he will return without delay He is wanted as a witness before the grand jury After a long conference with the Presi dent last week AttorneyGeneral Moody said that the Federal criminal statutes were so antiquated that they did not meet existing conditions Congress will be asked to make them broader and more stringent President Jordan of the Southern Cotton Association demands the removal of the secretary asserting that he is incompetent The secretary in whom Mr Roosevelt has confidence says it would be cowardly for him to resign while his department is under fire Investigation is be ing made as to the connection of several promi nent officers of the geological survey as di rectors and stockholders with a journal de voted to mining It is asserted that much information obtained at the expense of the government has been published by them in that journal long before the appearance of it in the official reports which it is said have been unwarrantably delayed It is asserted in similar charges against the Fish Bureau that much information has been published in maga zines by officers with illustrations prepared by the government which have appeared in the official reports several months later Dr D E Salmon the wellknown head of the Bureau of Animal Industry is criticized by some because of his association with the contractor who sup plies labels invented by himself for use in the inspection of meat It appears that Dr Salmon assisted this man some years ago and was his partner for six years in a small print ing business At Dr Salmons suggestion he invented the label but Dr Salmon withdrew from the partnership very soon after the inven tor obtained his first contract in 1901 and hasSCIENCE since had no financial interest in the business The inventor has been quite successful Many millions of the labels are used by the govern ment At present he is at the head of a busi ness capitalized at 500000 Having elicited these facts Secretary Wilson was inclined to discontinue the investigation of this case but at the direction of the President further in quiries are to be made It appears that Dr Moore who recently resigned could have made himself rich by a commercial use of his discovery of a bacterial culture for the inocula tion of soil He took out patents but gave the free use of the discovery to the people of the United States Some say that he could have become a millionaire by the sale of it here and abroad His resignation was due to public criticism of his conditional negotiations termi nated some time ago with a company engaged in the manufacture of the bacterial culture which he invented The Weather Bureau has been attacked by persons who asserted that 60000 was spent in erecting in the mountains of Virginia buildings which served as a kind of summer resort for the officers Investiga tion so far as it has proceeded indicates that there was no just warrant for such a charge Independent slaughterers and beef packers have complained that they suffered in competiti with the trust because they could obtain no government inspection of their products Dr Salmons answer to this is that the export trade which is controlled by the trust must be subjected to inspection that the appropria tions are not sufficient to provide for the in spection of meats for domestic consumption and that the house committee on agriculture has warned the department not to extend its inspection to the concerns engaged exclusively in the domestic tradeThe Independent THE PROPOSED ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE MASS ACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECH NOLOGY AND HARVARD UNIVERSITY1 THE corporation naturally reserved to itself the right to pass upon the financial aspects of the proposed arrangement For giving a de 1 Concluding part of an editorial in The Tech nology Review 213 cision on this point the members are fitted by training and occupation as a recital of the positions held by them would show Since however they are almost all unfamiliar with educational problems and since they regarded the alliance with Harvard as fundamentally an educational measure as the testimony just quoted plainly shows they very properly re ferred this proposed agreement to their own body of educational experts the faculty and to those other parties in interest the alumni who while not expert in matters of education are nevertheless familiar with the institute system of education and by their professional experience have given it the only conclusive test Upon receiving this invitation of the corpo ration the faculty who at the request of the president had studiously refrained from taking any earlier action upon the question seriously discussed and considered the problem upon its educational side in a protracted series of meetings and presented their collective opinion there being but seven dissenting voices including that of the president in a membership of sixtyfive in a temperate and reasoned report The executive committee of the alumni association also made every exer tion to have both sides of the question pre sented fully and fairly to the alumni which body deliberately expressed itself as opposed to the proposed agreement In view of the cor porations subsequent vote and the failure of that body to attempt to conciliate the opposing views by suggesting any modification of the proposed agreement or even by stating its rea sons for disagreeing with those views the alumni may properly inquire why they should have been encouraged to believe their opinion to be really wanted The faculty may well ask why they should have been put to so much trouble if their judgment as experienced teachers upon a question declared to be fun damentally educational was after all to re ceive so little respect The faculty had every moral right they had every right in equity not only to be heard but to be heeded More over if as the president declares the fame of the institute rests upon the work and repu tation of the alumni those alumni should cer AUGUST 18 1905

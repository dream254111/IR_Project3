2145 AND 2147 OF CHAPTER 97 OF THE CODE OF VIRGINIA IN RE LATION TO OYSTERS AND TO ADD INDEPENDENT SECTIONS THERETO ACTS 189192 CHAP 363 P 595 CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING PROVISION  THE INSPECTOR SHALL REQUIRE EACH TONGMAN REGISTERED IN HIS DISTRICT TO MAKE TO HIM ON THE SATURDAY OF EACH WEEK OR WITHIN THREE DAYS THEREAFTER DURING THE LAWFUL SEASON A TRUE AND ACCURATE RETURN OF THE AMOUNT OF SALES

AT THE TIME OF REGISTERING HIS BOAT TO PAY TO THE INSPECTOR THE SUM OF TWO DOLLARS IN DISCHARGE OF HIS OBLIGATION FOR THE ENTIRE SEASON WAS INDICTED UNDER THE SAID STATUTE IN THE COUNTY COURT OF GLOUCESTER ON THE 5TH DAY OF OCTOBER 1893 FOR FAILING TO MAKE THE RETURN WHICH WAS DUE FROM HIM TO THE INSPECTOR ON THE WEEK ENDING SEPTEMBER 16 1893 OR WITHIN THE THREE DAYS THEREAFTER OF THE AMOUNT OF HIS SALES OF OYSTERS TO THE INDICTMENT THE DEFENDANT DEMURRED THE COURT SUSTAINED THE DEMURRER AND GAVE JUDGMENT FOR THE DEFENDANT UPON A PETITION BY THE COMMONWEALTH TO THE JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT COURT OF GLOUCESTER COUNTY FOR A WRIT OF ERROR TO THE SAID JUDGMENT THERE WAS A PRO FORMA REFUSAL IN PURSUANCE OF AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE ATTORNEY FOR THE COMMONWEALTH AND FOR THE DEFENDANT IN ORDER THAT THE CASE MIGHT BE PROMPTLY BROUGHT BEFORE THIS COURT A WRIT OF ERROR WAS THEREUPON GRANTED BY ONE OF THE JUDGES OF THIS COURT BY AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING AND FILED WITH THE RECORD ALL ERRORS AND OBJECTIONS TO THE INDICTMENT EXCEPT AS TO THE VALIDITY OF THESTATUTE UPON WHICH IT WAS BASED WERE WAIVED BY THE COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENDANT THE ONLY QUESTION THEN FOR OUR CONSIDERATION IS THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE STATUTE ABOVE QUOTED IT IS FIRST ASSAILED ON THE GROUND THAT THE TAX PRESCRIBED IS NOT EQUAL AND UNIFORM AND THAT THEREFORE THE STATUTE IS OBNOXIOUS TO SECTION 1 ARTICLE X OF THE CONSTITUTION IN SUPPORT OF THIS CONTENTION QUITE A NUMBER OF OBJECTIONS TO THE ACT WERE URGED SECTION 1 ARTICLE X OF THE CONSTITUTION PRESCRIBES THAT TAXA TION EXCEPT AS HEREINAFTER PROVIDED WHETHER IMPOSED BY THE STATE COUNTY OR CORPORATE BODIES SHALL BE EQUAL AND UNIFORM AND ALL PROP ERTY BOTH REAL AND PERSONAL SHALL BE TAXED IN PROPORTION TO ITS VALUE TO BE ASCERTAINED AS PRESCRIBED BY LAW NO ONE SPECIES OF PROPERTY FROM WHICH A TAX MAY BE COLLECTED SHALL BE TAXEA HIGHER THAN ANY OTHER SPECIES OF PROPERTY OF EQUAL VALUE AN INSPECTION OF THE STATUTE UNDER CONSIDERATION SHOWS THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY AND UNIFORMITY WAS STRICTLY OBSERVED IN THE IM 106 JUNECOMMONWEALTH V BROWN POSITION OF THE TAX THE VALUE OF THE OYSTERS FOR TAXATION COULD NOT WELL BE ASCERTAINED OR FIXED IN A MORE JUST MANNER THAN IS PRESCRIBED BY THE STATUTE IT IS TO BE ASCERTAINED BY THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF SALES EACH WEEK DURING THE OYSTER SEASON IT IS THEIR ACTUAL VALUE IN MARKET AND NOT MERELY THEIR APPRAISED VALUE A MORE ACCURATE MODE OF ASCERTAINING THE VALUATION FOR TAXATION OF OYSTERS SUBJECT TO BE TAXED COULD NOT WELL BE DEVISED AND THE RATE OF TAXATION IS PRECISELY THE SAME AS IS PRESCRIBED FOR OTHER PROPERTY THE INSPECTOR IS TO COLLECT EACH WEEK FROM A TONGMAN ON THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF HIS SALES FOR THAT WEEK AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT OF TAX THAT MAY BE LEVIED BY THE STATE ON ANY OTHER SPECIES OF PROPERTY NO MORE NO LESS THE TAX PRESCRIBED IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH IS LEVIED BY THE STATE ON ANY OTHER SPECIES OF PROPERTY AND THE VALUATION IS ASCERTAINED IN THE MOST ACCURATE AND JUST MANNER THERE IS NO JUST GROUND TO COM PLAIN OF THE TAX FOR INEQUALITY OR WANT OF UNIFORMITY IT IS OBJECTED THAT THE VALUATION FOR TAXATION OF OYSTERS IS NOT ASCER TAINED IN THE SAME WAY OR BY THE SAME METHOD THAT IS PRESCRIBED FOR OTHER PROPERTY THAT THE VALUATION OF OTHER PROPERTY IS ASSESSED BY OFFICERS ELECTED OR APPOINTED FOR THE PURPOSE THAT THE TAX ON OYSTERS IS TO BE ASSESSED AND PAID WEEKLY WHILE ALL OTHER PROPERTY IS ONLY AS SESSED ANNUALLY AND THE TAX PAID ANNUALLY AND THAT THE FAILURE OF A TONGMAN TO MAKE WEEKLY A RETURN OF HIS SALES TO THE INSPECTOR IS MADE A MISDEMEANOR AND SUBJECTS HIM ON CONVICTION TO THE PAYMENT OF A FINE WHILE THE OWNERS OF OTHER PROPERTY SUBJECT TO TAXATION ARE NOT LIABLE TO BE PUNISHED FOR A LIKE DELINQUENCY NEITHER ONE NOR ALL OF THESE OBJECTIONS AFFECT THE EQUALITY OR UNI FORMITY OF THE TAX IMPOSED ON A TONGMAN NOR OFFEND AGAINST SECTION 1 ARTICLE X OF THE CONSTITUTION WHETHER TRUE OR FALSE THEY DO NOT OPERATE TO IMPOSE ANY GREATER BURDEN ON HIM THAN IS BORNE BY THE OWNER OF ANY OTHER SPECIES OF PROPERTY OF THE SAME VALUE THEY DO NOT ADD ONE IOTA TO THE TAX HE HAS TO PAY AND THE STATUTE IS THEREFORE IN STRICT ACCORD WITH BOTH THE LETTER AND SPIRIT OF THE CONSTITUTION IN THE RESPECT COMPLAINED OF THE CONSTITUTION DOES NOT PRESCRIBE THAT THE VALUATION OF ALL PROPERTY FOR TAXATION SHALL BE ASCERTAINED IN THE SAME WAY OR MANNER IT IS NOT EVEN IMPLIED IN THE NATURE OF THINGS IT COULD NOT BE DONE THE MANY KINDS OR SPECIES OF PROPERTY WITH THEIR DIVERSE CHARACTERISTICS RENDER IT IMPOSSIBLE THE VALUATION IS TO BE ASCERTAINED AS PRESCRIBED BY LAWTHAT IS BY THE LEGISLATUREAND IN AS JUST A MANNER AS POSSI BLE AND ON SUCH VALUATION THE SAME RATE OF TAX SHALL BE IMPOSED AS ON 1895 107VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER OTHER PROPERTY SO THAT NO SPECIES OF PROPERTY    SHALL BE TAXED HIGHER THAN ANY OTHER SPECIES OF PROPERTY OF EQUAL VALUE THE REQUIREMENT OF EQUALITY AND UNIFORMITY IS SATISFIED BY SUCH REGULA TIONS AS WILL SECURE AN EQUAL RATE AND A JUST VALUATION WITHOUT REFER ENCE TO THE METHOD OF VALUATION AND IN ORDER TO BE UNIFORM A TAX NEED NOT BE IMPOSED AND ASSESSED UPON ALL PROPERTY BY THE SAME AGENCY OR OFFICER SHENANDOAH VAL R CO V SUPERVISORS OF CLARKE CO 78 VA 269 KENTUCKY RAILROAD TAX CASES 115 U S 337 338 CENTRAL IOWA RY CO V BOARD OF SUPRS 67 IOWA 199 AND LOUISVILLE  N A R CO V STATE 25 IND 177 THE LEGISLATURE MAY PRESCRIBE ANY METHOD IT MAY DEEM BEST FOR ATTAINING A JUST AND FAIR VALUATION OF ANY SPECIES OF PROPERTY AND THE COURT COULD NOT DECLARE ANY SUCH LAW VOID UNLESS IT MANIFESTLY VIOLATED THE PRINCIPLES REQUIRED BY THE CONSTITUTION THE FACT THAT OYSTERS ARE REQUIRED TO BE ASSESSED AND THE TAX TO BE PAID EVERY WEEK WHILE OTHER PROPERTY IS ONLY ASSESSED AND THE TAX PAID ONCE A YEAR DOES NOT WORK INEQUALITY IN THE AMOUNT OF THE TAX PAID THE TONGLMAN DOES NOT PAY WEEKLY ON THE SAME PROPERTY IN THE RE SULT HE ONLY PAYS ON THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF HIS SALES DURING THE SEASON THE REGULAR PRO RATA TAX THAT IS PAID ON ALL OTHER PROPERTY THE FACT THAT HE PAYS THE TAX IN WEEKLY INSTALLMENTS INSTEAD OF ONE ANNUAL PAYMENT DOES NOT INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF HIS TAX ONE STIVER THE AMOUNT TO BE PAID TO THE STATE IS PRECISELY THE SAME WHETHER PAID IN ONE SINGLE PAYMENT OR IN WEEKLY INSTALLMENTS IT IS CLAIMED THAT THE TAX IN QUESTION BEING ASSESSED ON THE AGGRE GATE AMOUNT OF SALES OF OYSTERS IS AN INCOME TAX AND IS THEREFORE VIOLATIVE OF SECTION 4 ARTICLE X OF THE CONSTITUTION WHICH EXEMPTS INCOMES UNDER 600 FROM TAXATION IT IS A SUFFICIENT ANSWER TO THIS OBJECTION TO SAY THAT THE TAX IS ASSESSED ON SALES AND NOT UPON INCOME AND THAT THE SECTION OF THE CONSTITUTION REFERRED TO HAS NO APPLICATION TO THE CASE AND FURTHERMORE THAT THE TAX ON THE  AMOUNT OF SALES OF OYSTERS  TAKEN FROM THEIR NATURAL BEDS IS EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZED BY SECTION 2 OF THE SAID ARTICLE OF THE CONSTITUTION IT IS FURTHER OBJECTED THAT BECAUSE THE ACT SUBJECTS A TONGMAN TO A FINE OF NOT LESS THAN 10 NOR MORE THAN 50 IF HE FAIL TO MAKE TO THE INSPECTOR THE REQUIRED WEEKLY RETURN OF SALES IT DISCRIMINATES AGAINST THE TONGMAN AS NO OTHER OWNER OF PROPERTY SUBJECT TO TAXATION IS LIABLE TO A FINE FOR A LIKE DELINQUENCY IF THIS WERE IN FACT TRUE IT WOULD NOT BE CAUSE TO DECLARE THE STATUTE VOID FOR INEQUALITY OR WANT OF UNIFORMITY IN THE TAX IMPOSED ON TONGMEN OF OYSTERS IT IN NO WISE ADDS TO OR INCREASES THE TAX THAT REMAINS FIXED AND IS THE SAME THAT 108 JUNECOMMONWEALTH V BROWN IS LEVIED BY THE STATE ON ANY OTHER SPECIES OF PROPERTY IF THE TONGMEN RESPECT THE LAW BY WHICH THE VALUATION OF OYSTERS FOR ASSESS MENT IS TO BE ASCERTAINED THEY WILL NEVER INCUR THE FINE A STATUTE THAT IS OTHERWISE VALID IS NOT RENDERED INVALID BY HAVING A PENALTY AFFIXED FOR ITS VIOLATION THE WRONG OF THE CITIZEN CAN NEVER MAKE A VALID LAW VOID BUT THE CLAIM OF DISCRIMINATION IS NOT FOUNDED IN FACT OWNERS OF OTHER PROPERTY ARE SUBJECT TO PUNISHMENT FOR A LIKE DELINQUENCY THE PENALTY PRESCRIBED BY THE STATUTE IN QUESTION IS FOR FAILING TO MAKE THE RETURN OF SALES TO THE INSPECTOR WHO IS TO ASSESS THE TAX UNDER THE GENERAL LAW FORMS FOR LISTS OF VALUATIONS ARE FURNISHED BY THE ASSESSOR TO THE OWNERS OF PERSONAL PROPERTY WHICH THEY ARE REQUIRED TO FILL OUT BY LISTING THEIR PROPERTY AND AFFIXING VALUATIONS THEREOF AND WHICH AFTER BEING VERIFIED BY OATH ARE REQUIRED TO BE RETURNED TO THE ASSESSOR OR CLERK OF THE COURT WITHIN TEN DAYS THEREAFTER AND THE FAIL URE TO RETURN THE SAME WITHIN THE TIME REQUIRED AND TO MAKE OATH TO ITS TRUTH AND FAIRNESS SUBJECTS THE OFFENDER TO A FORFEITURE OF NOT LESS THAN 30 NOR MORE THAN 1000 CODE OF VA SECTIONS 491 494 497 STATUTES IMPOSING PENALTIES FOR FAILURE OR REFUSAL TO MAKE SUCH RE RETURNS OR TO RETURN SUCH LISTS ARE QUITE COMMON AND HAVE BEEN UNI FORMLY

ENC LAW 206 NOR DOES THE STATUTE INFRINGE IN THE LEAST ON THE PROVISION OF THE CONSTITUTION WHICH AUTHORIZES A TAX TO BE IMPOSED ON  THE AMOUNT OF SALES OF OYSTERS TAKEN FROM THE NATURAL BEDS BY ANY CITIZEN IN ANY ONE YEAR    AT A RATE NOT EXCEEDING THE RATE OF TAXATION IM POSED ON ANY OTHER SPECIES OF PROPERTY ARTICLE X SECTION 2 IT IMPOSES AS HAS BEEN SEEN A TAX ON THE WEEKLY SALES OF OYSTERS EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT OF THE TAX THAT MAY BE LEVIED BY THE STATE ON ANY OTHER SPECIES OF PROPERTY BUT PROVIDES THAT IF AT THE TIME OF REGISTERING HIS BOAT ANY TONGMAN SHALL PREFER AND ELECT TO PAY AND PAY TO THE INSPECTOR THE SUM OF TWO DOLLARS THE INSPECTOR SHALL GIVE HIM A RECEIPT THEREFOR IN WHICH HE SHALL STATE THAT THE SAID PAYMENT IS IN DISCHARGE OF HIS OBLIGATION UNDER THIS SECTION FOR THE ENTIRE SEASON FOR WHICH HIS BOAT IS REGISTERED SO FAR AS THE WEEKLY RETURNS AND THE AMOUNT TO BE PAID THEREON IS CONCERNED IT IS INSISTED THAT THIS IS IN SUBSTANCE AND EFFECT A LICENSE TAX AND NOT A PROPERTY TAX AND IS THEREFORE OBNOXIOUS TO SECTION 2 ARTICLE X OF THE CONSTITUTION THIS CLAIM IS NOT WELL FOUNDED THE CONSTITUTION EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZES THE LEGISLATURE TO IM 1895 109VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER POSE A TAX ON THE AMOUNT OF SALES OF OYSTERS TAKEN FROM THEIR NATURAL BEDS BY ANY CITIZEN IN ANY ONE YEAR BUT LIMITS THE TAX TO THE RATE IM POSED UPON ANY OTHER SPECIES OF PROPERTY THE STATUTE PURSUING DIRECTLY THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION REQUIRES A TONGMAN TO MAKE RE TURN TO THE INSPECTOR OF THE AMOUNT OF HIS SALES OF OYSTERS SO TAKEN AND THE INSPECTOR TO COLLECT FROM THE TONGMAN ON THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF SALES AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT OF TAX LEVIED BY THE STATE ON OTHER PROPERTY THUS THE TONGMAN IS REQUIRED TO PAY ON THE AMOUNT OF HIS SALES AS THE CONSTITUTION AUTHORIZES AND NOT OTHERWISE AND ONLY SUCH AMOUNT AS IS EQUAL TO THE TAX IMPOSED BY THE STATE ON OTHER PROP ERTY THE STATUTE DOES NOT THEREFORE OFFEND AGAINST THE CONSTITUTION AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW IT CAN BE SO CLAIMED THE PROVISION THAT IF THE TONGMAN AT THE TIME OF REGISTERING HIS BOAT SHALL PREFER AND ELECT TO PAY AND PAY THE SUM OF TWO DOLLARS SUCH PAYMENT SHALL BE A DISCHARGE OF HIS OBLIGATION FOR THE ENTIRE SEA SON FOR THE TAX IMPOSED ON THE AMOUNT OF HIS SALES IS SIMPLY A PRIVI LEGE EXTENDED TO HIM WHICH HE MAY EITHER ACCEPT OR DECLINE HE IS UNDER NO COMPULSION WHATEVER TO AVAIL HIMSELF OF IT HE IS WITHOUT CAUSE OF COMPLAINT ON THIS SCORE NOR UNLESS ACCEPTED DOES IT AFFECT THE TAX IMPOSED IN STRICT ADHERENCE TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION WE HAVE NOW DISPOSED OF THE MANY OBJECTIONS RAISED TO THE CONSTI TUTIONALITY OF THE STATUTE ON THE GROUND OF INEQUALITY OR WANT OF UNI FORMITY IN THE TAX IT IMPOSES AND THE OBJECTION THAT IT IS A LICENSE AND NOT A PROPERTY TAX IT IS IN OUR OPINION VALID AGAINST SUCH ATTACK IT IS NEXT CONTENDED THAT IT IS REPUGNANT TO SECTION 15 ARTICLE V OF THE CONSTITUTION WHICH IS AS FOLLOWS NO LAW SHALL EMBRACE MORE THAN ONE OBJECT WHICH SHALL BE EXPRESSED IN ITS TITLE NOR SHALL ANY LAW BE REVIVED OR AMENDED WITH REFERENCE TO ITS TITLE BUT THE ACT REVIVED OR THE SECTION AMENDED SHALL BE REENACTED AND PUBLISHED AT LENGTH THE TITLE OF

REPEATED IT IS ENTITLED AN ACT TO AMEND AND REENACT SECTIONS 2131 2133 2134 2135 2137 2148 2151 2153 AND TO REPEAL SEC TIONS 2141 2142 2143 2144 2145 AND 2147 OF CHAPTER 97 OF THE CODE OF VIRGINIA IN RELATION TO OYSTERS AND TO ADD INDEPENDENT SEC TIONS THERETO IT IS CLAIMED THAT THE BODY OF THE STATUTE EMBRACES MANY OBJECTS INSTEAD OF ONE OBJECT AS REQUIRED BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION AND FURTHER THAT THESE MANY OBJECTS ARE NOT EXPRESSED IN THE TITLE THAT IT 110 JUNE1895 COMMONWEALTH V BROWN 111 BOTH AMENDS AND REPEALS MANY SECTIONS OF THE CODE AND THAT THE IN DEPENDENT SECTIONS HAVE

REFERENCE TO WHAT SUBJECT EACH SECTION REPEALED HAD REFERENCE TO AND THAT THE SUBJECTMATTER IN THE INDEPENDENT SECTIONS SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLEARLY SET FORTH IN THE TITLE THE PROVISION OF THE CONSTITUTION IS A WISE AND WHOLESOME ONE ITS PURPOSE IS APPARENT IT WAS TO PREVENT THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLA TURE AND THE PEOPLE FROM BEING MISLED BY THE TITLE OF A LAW IT WAS INTENDED TO PREVENT THE USE OF DECEPTIVE TITLES AS A COVER FOR VICIOUS LEGISLATION TO PREVENT THE PRACTICE OF BRINGING TOGETHER INTO ONE BILL FOR CORRUPT PURPOSES SUBJECTS DIVERSE AND DISSIMILAR IN THEIR NATURE AND HAVING NO NECESSARY CONNECTION WITH EACH OTHER AND TO PREVENT SUR PRISE OR FRAUD IN LEGISLATION BY MEANS OF PROVISIONS IN BILLS OF WHICH THE TITLES GAVE NO INTIMATION AND ON THE OTHER HAND IT WAS NOT INTENDED TO OBSTRUCT HONEST LEGISLA TION OR TO PREVENT THE INCORPORATION INTO A SINGLE ACT OF THE ENTIRE STATUTORY LAW UPON ONE GENERAL SUBJECT IT WAS NOT DESIGNED TO EM BARRASS LEGISLATION BY COMPELLING THE MULTIPLICATION OF LAWS BY THE PASSAGE OF SEPARATE ACTS ON A SINGLE GENERAL SUBJECT ALTHOUGH THE ACT OR STATUTE AUTHORIZES MANY THINGS OF A DIVERSE NATURE TO BE DONE THE TITLE WILL BE SUFFICIENT IF THE

THAT THE ACT IN QUESTION DID NOT PURPORT TO AMEND THE ORIGINAL ACT OF 188384 BUT TO AMEND AND REENACT AND REPEAL VARIOUS SECTIONS OF CHAPTER 97 OF THE CODE OF VIRGINIA AND ADD OTHER SECTIONS TO IT THIS IS TRUE AND IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT THE REVISORS OF THE CODE 1887 INCORPORATED INTO IT THE PROVISIONS OF THE ACT OF 188384 AND THAT THE SECTIONS SO AMENDED AND REENACTED AND THOSE REPEALED WERE MAINLY TAKEN BY THE REVISORS FROM THE SAID ACT BUT THE FACT THAT THE ACT PURPORTS TO AMEND THE CODE INSTEAD OF THE ORIGINAL ACT SO FAR FROM INVALIDATING IT IS AN ADDITIONAL REASON WHY IT IS NOT

IS SUBSTANTIALLY STATED AND AN AMENDMENT IS PROPOSED TO SUCH CHAPTER THE PUBLIC ARE NOTIFIED THAT A CHANGE IS PROPOSED IN THE LAW RELATING TO THE CLASS OF OFFENSES TREATED OF IN SUCH CHAPTERS AND THAT AMENDMENTS MAY ALWAYS BE MADE BY ADDING A NEW SECTION AS AN ACT IS AMENDED BY ADDING A NEW SECTION IT IS FURTHER CONTENDED THAT THE ACT IS UNCONSTITIONAL BECAUSE IT IM POSES A TAX WITHOUT STATING THE TAX OR THE OBJECT OF IT AND IS THEREFORE REPUGNANT TO SECTION 16 ARTICLE X OF THE CONSTITUTION WHICH PRO VIDES THAT EVERY LAW WHICH IMPOSES CONTINUES OR REVIVES A TAX SHALL DISTINCTLY STATE THE TAX AND THE OBJECT TO WHICH IT IS TO BE APPLIED AND IT SHALL NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO REFER TO ANY OTHER LAW TO FIX SUCH TAX OR OBJECT SO FAR AS WE ARE AWARE THIS PARTICULAR PROVISION OF THE CONSTITUTION HAS NOT HERETOFORE BEEN REVIEWED BY THIS COURT IT WAS NOT IN ANY CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE PRIOR TO 1869 IT APPEARS THERE FOR THE FIRST TIME IT IS TRUE THAT THE ACT CONTAINS A TAX IS IT DISTINCTLY STATED  IT IS 1895 115VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER PRESCRIBED TO BE AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT OF TAX THAT MAY BE LEVIED BY THE STATE ON ANY OTHER SPECIES OF PROPERTY IT IS MADE EX ACTLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH IS IMPOSED ON OTHER PROPERTY TONG MEN ARE REQUIRED TO PAY THE SAME TAX ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OYSTERS TAKEN AND SOLD BY THEM THAT IS PAID BY OTHERS ON OTHER PROPERTY OF THE SAME VALUE THE TAX IS ACCURATELY PRESCRIBED IT IS NOT OPEN TO MIS TAKE OR DOUBT IT IS IN THE SENSE OF THE CONSTITUTION DISTINCTLY STATED THE ACT SPECIFICALLY AND DEFINITELY FIXES THE AMOUNT OF THE TAX AND IN THIS RESPECT COMPLIES WITH THE LETTER AND PURPOSE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION NEXT AS TO THE OBJECT OF THE TAX IT IS CLAIMED THAT THIS IS NEW LEG ISLATION AND NOT AN AMENDMENT OF A FORMER LAW BUT THE ENACTMENT OF A NEW SECTION AND THAT THEREFORE IT IMPOSES A TAX BUT THIS IS A MIS TAKE IT DOES NOT IMPOSE A NEW TAX IT SIMPLY CONTINUES A TAX AL READY EXISTING AND IN FORCE WHEN THE ACT WAS PASSED THE VERY ACT WHICH PRESCRIBES THE TAX REPEALS A SECTION OF THE CODE TAKEN FROM THE ACT OF 188384 CHAPTER 254  8 WHICH FIXED THE SAME TAX IT IS SIMPLY THE SUBSTITUTION BY THE SAME ACT OF ANOTHER SECTION FOR THE ORIGINAL SECTION BOTH CONTAINING THE SAME TAX THE ACT THEREFORE INSTEAD OF IMPOSING A TAX SIMPLY CONTINUES IT AVE HAVE ALREADY SEEN IN DISCUSSING THE OBJECTION TO THE TITLE OF THE ACT THAT WHERE AN ACT IS AMENDATORY OF AN ORIGINAL ACT AND THE TITLE OF THE ORIGINAL ACT IS SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE MATTER OF THE AMENDMENT IT IS SUFFICIENT AND THE TITLE OF THE AMENDATORY ACT BECOMES UNIMPORTANT FOR THE SAME REASON WHERE AN AMENDATORY ACT MERELY CONTINUES A TAX WITHOUT STATING THE OBJECT TO WHICH IT IS TO BE APPLIED IT WILL BE A COM PLIANCE WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION IF THE ORIGINAL ACT WHICH IM POSED THE TAX STATES THE OBJECT TO WHICH IT WAS TO BE APPLIED UNDER THE CONSTITUTION THE TITLE IS A NECESSARY PART OF EVERY STATUTE THE TAX WHICH THE ACT IN QUESTION CONTINUES WAS IMPOSED BY THE ACT OF 188384 WE HAVE ONLY TO REFER TO THAT ACT TO FIND A SATISFACTORY ANSWER TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL OBJECTION NOW URGED IT IS ENTITLED AN ACT FOR THE PRESERVATION OF OYSTERS TO OBTAIN REVENUE FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF TAKING THEM WITHIN THE WATERS OF THE COMMONWEALTH THE OBJECT OF THE TAX IS CONCISELY BUT EXPRESSLY STATED IT IS TO OBTAIN REVENUE WHAT IS  REVENUE  IT IS THE INCOME WHICH A STATE COLLECTS AND RE CEIVES INTO ITS TREASURY AND IS APPROPRIATED FOR THE PAYMENT OF ITS EX PENSES THE OBJECT OF THE ACT THEN WAS TO RAISE MONEY FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE STATE IT IS CONCISELY DEFINED BY THE WORDS TO  OBTAIN REVENUE BUT BY THAT PHRASE THE OBJECT OF THE TAX IS AS POPU 116 JUNECOMMONWEALTH V BROWN LARLY UNDERSTOOD AS IF IT HAD BEEN DECLARED IN THE TITLE OR BODY OF THE ACT THAT THE OBJECT WAS TO RAISE MONEY FOR THE CURRENT EXPENSES OF THE GOVERNMENT WHILE THE ACT OF 189192 DOES NOT PURPORT TO AMEND THE ACT OF 188384 BUT THE CODE YET IT IS THAT ACT AS PUT INTO THE CODE WHICH IS IN REALITY AMENDED IT CANNOT BE NECESSARY IN AN AMENDMENT WHICH CONTINUES A TAX CONTAINED IN THE ORIGINAL ACT WITHOUT CHANGING THE OB JECT OF THE TAX TO REPEAT THE OBJECT THE STATEMENT OF IT IN THE ORIGINAL ACT IS SUFFICIENT IT APPEARS FROM SECTION 2135 OF CHAPTER 97 OF THE CODE WHERE THE ACT OF 188384 WAS INCORPORATED INTO IT THAT EACH INSPECTOR OF OYSTERS IS REQUIRED TO PAY ALL TAXES ON SALES OF OYSTERS TOGETHER WITH ALL FEES AND FINES COLLECTED BY HIM  INTO THE PUBLIC TREASURY TO THE CREDIT OF THE OYSTER FUND THIS SECTION AS AMENDED AND REENACTED BY THE ACT OF 189192 USES THE SAME LANGUAGE THE OYSTER FUND HERE REFERRED TO IS MERELY AN ACCOUNT THAT SHOWS UPON THE CREDIT SIDE THE AMOUNT OF TAXES RENTS FEES AND FINES DERIVED FROM OYSTERS AND UPON THE DEBIT SIDE THE EXPENSES INCURRED IN SUSTAINING THE MEANS FURNISHED BY LAW FOR THEIR PRESERVATION AND OBTAINING REVENUE FROM THEM IT IS SIMPLY KEPT FOR THE INFORMATION OF THE EXECUTIVE OF THE STATE THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY AND THE PUBLIC IN ORDER THAT IT MAY BE CONVENIENTLY SEEN WHETHER OYS TERS ARE A SOURCE OF REVENUE TO THE STATE AND IF SO TO WHAT EXTENT IT HAS NO REFERENCE TO THE OBJECT OF THE TAX AND IN NO WISE ALTERS OR AFFECTS ITS OBJECT AS EXPRESSED IN THE TITLE OF THE ACT OF 188384 OR DIVERTS THE MONEYS RECEIVED UNDER THE TAX FROM THE PAYMENT OF THE ORDINARY AND CURRENT EXPENSES OF THE STATE THE TAX IS DISTINCTLY STATED IN THE ACT AND THERE CAN BE NO MIS UNDERSTANDING OR DOUBT AS TO THE OBJECT TO WHICH IT IS TO BE APPLIED THE LAW IS VALID THE CONSTITUTION OF NEW YORK CONTAINS THE SAME PROVISION IN THE SAME IDENTICAL WORDS IT HAS BEEN CONSTRUED MORE THAN ONCE BY THE COURTS OF THAT STATE AND LIBERALLY INTERPRETED IT CAME BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW YORK IN PEOPLE V SUPER VISORS OF ORANGE CO 27 BARB 575 WHERE THE ACT PRESCRIBED THAT THE MONEY RAISED SHOULD BE PAID INTO THE TREASURY OF THE STATE TO THE CREDIT OF THE GENERAL FUND IT WAS OBJECTED THAT THIS WAS NOT A SUFFI CIENT STATEMENT OF THE OBJECT TO WHICH THE TAX WAS TO BE APPLIED AS RE QUIRED BY THE CONSTITUTION BUT THE COURT HLELD OTHERWISE AND DECLARED THE ACT VALID AN APPEAL WAS TAKEN TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF NEW 1895 117VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER YORK WHICH AFFIRMED THE JUDGMENT OF THE SUPREME COURT ID 17 N Y 235 IT WAS AGAIN BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW YORK IN THE CASE OF PEOPLE V NATIONAL FIRE INSURANCE CO 27 HUN 188 WHERE THE ACT SPECIFIED THAT THE TAXES SHALL BE APPLICABLE TO THE PAYMENT OF THE ORDINARY AND CURRENT EXPENSES OF THE STATE IT WAS HELD THAT THIS SUFFICIENTLY STATED THE OBJECT OF THE TAX THESE DECISIONS SHOW THAT UNDER A REASONABLE AND FAIR INTERPRETATION OF THIS PROVISION OF THE CONSTITUTION IT IS SUFFICIENT TO INDICAFE GENERALLY THE PURPOSE TO WHICH THE TAX IS TO BE APPLIED OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE NECESSARY AFTER HAVING STATED THE TAX AND THE FUND TO WHICH WHEN COLLECTED AND PAID INTO THE TREASURY IT IS TO BE CREDITED TO GO FURTHER AND SPECIFY THE PERSONS TO WHOM AND THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH IT SHOULD BE DISBURSED IT WAS WELL SAID BY THE COURT IN ONE OF THE CASES CITED ABOVE THAT IF THIS WERE NECESSARY EVERY TAX BILL WOULD THEN BE AN APPROPRIATION BILL ALSOA REQUIREMENT THAT WOULD BE OF INFINITE EM BARRASSMENT TO THE GOVERNMENT AND PRACTICALLY DEPRIVE THE LEGISLATURE OF ALL POWER TO RAISE MONEY BY TAXATION EVERY LAW ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE IS PRESUMED TO BE IN CONFORMITY WITH THE CONSTITUTION UNTIL THE CONTRARY IS SHOWN AND IT DEVOLVES ON HIM WHO ALLEGES ITS INVALIDITY TO SHOW IT IT IS A GRAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR A COURT OR JUDGE TO PRONOUNCE A SOLEMN AND DELIBERATE ACT OF THE SOVER EIGN LAWMAKING POWER UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND VOID IT SHOULD NEVER BE DONE IN A DOUBTFUL CASE AND ESPECIALLY WHERE NO GREAT PRINCIPLE OF LIBERTY OR THE SECURITY OF PROPERTY  ENSHRINED IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES AND REPEATED IN THAT OF THE STATE  IS INVOLVED BUT ONLY SOME RULE OF LEGISLATIVE ACTION WHEN IT IS DONE THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE CONSTITUTION AND THE LAW MUST BE CLEAR AND PALPABLE TO DOUBT IS TO AFFIRM THE VALIDITY OF THE LAW THE STATUTE WHICH HAS BEEN ASSAILED ON SO MANY CONSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS IS NOT AT LEAST TO OUR MINDS IN PLAIN AND PALPABLE CONFLICT WITH THE CONSTITUTION THE RESULT IS THAT THE JUDGMENT OF THE COUNTY COURT OF GLOUCESTER COUNTY MUST BE REVERSED AND ANNULLED AND THE DEMURRER TO THE INDICT MENT OVERRULED REVERSED BY THE EDITORTHIS IS AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT CASES EVER DECIDED BY OUR COURT OF APPEALS ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE CONSTITUTION OF VIRGINIA THE DE CISION WAS NOT HASTYWITHOUT THE

LEADING AND CONTROLLING ONE IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE CONSTITU TIONAL PROVISIONS PASSED UPON WE ARE ESPECIALLY DELIGHTED WITH THE LIBERAL AND SENSIBLE RULE LAID DOWN FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF SEC 15 ART V OF THE CONSTITUTION IN ITS APPLICATION TO LEGIS LATIVE AMENDMENTS OF THE CODE ANY MORE RESTRICTED RULE WOULD BE ATTENDED WITH INCALCULABLE MISCHIEF THE CODE OF VIRGINIA IS ONE ACT WITH APPROPRIATE TITLE IT IS DIVIDED INTO CHAPTERS AND THESE ARE SUBDIVIDED INTO SECTIONS NUMBERED CONSECUTIVELY FROM BEGINNING TO END THE HEADINGS OF THE CHAPTERS SHOW THE SUBJECTS OF THEM AND SO OF THE SECTIONS IT CANNOT THEREFORE BE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT AS TO TITLE IN AMENDING ANY PART OF THE CODE TO DO MORE THAN TO REFER IN THE TITLE OF THE AMENDATORY ACT TO THE PARTICULAR SECTION OR SECTIONS NOT NECESSARILY TO THE CHAPTER OR CHAPTERS OF THE CODE TO BE AMENDED THE SECTION OR SECTIONS REFERRED TO WILL SHOW THE SUBJECT AND IF THE AMENDMENT IS NOT

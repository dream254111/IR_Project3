BROWN Virginia Court of Appeals At Richmond March 21 1895 1 CONSTITUTIONAL LAWOystertaxuniformitylicenseincometax A statute which requires each tongman to make a return of the sales of oysters made by him during the week preceding and which imposes a tax on such sales equal to the amount of tax levied by the State on any other species of prop erty and which prescribes penalties for failure to make such returns but which allows such tongman if he prefers to pay a sum certain fixed by the statute in lieu of such tax is constitutional and is not in conflict with Sec 1 Art X of the Constitution nor with Sec 2 of Art X but is in strict con formity with the latter section The uniformity of the tax is not affected by the manner in which the value of the property is ascertained nor by the fact that the tax is payable weekly nor by the fact that penalties are prescribed for failure to make prompt returns nor by the privilege extended of paying a sum in gross in lieu of the tax prescribed Nor is such tax a license Nor is it an incometax within the meaning of Sec 4 Art X of the Constitution 2 CONSTITUTIONAL LAWTitle of actsingle object The title of an act will be sufficient within the meaning of Sec 15 Art V of the Constitution if the thinrgs authorized to be done though of a diverse nature may be fairly re garded as in furtherance of the object expressed in the title All that is re quired is that the subjects embraced in the statute but not specified in the title be congruous and have natural connection with or be germane to the subject expressed in the title And the Coustitution is to be liberally con strued so as to uphold the law if practicable 3 CONSTITUTIONAL LAWTitle of act and of amendatory act If an act of As sembly has been amended it is unnecessary to enquire whether the title of the amendatory act would of itself be sufficient it is enough if the title of the original act is sufficient to embrace the matters contained in the amenda tory act 4 CONSTITUTIONAL LAWTitle of actamandatory act Where a prior act of Assembly has been substantially incorporated into the Code and some of these provisions of the Code are amended and reenacted others repealed and new sections added to that chapter by a subsequent act of Assembly the title of which refers to the numbers of the sections amended or repealed and the number and subject of the chapter and the amendment and new sections are germane to the title of the original act the title of the amenda tory act is a sufficient compliance with Sec 15 Art V of the Constitution 5 CONSTITUTIONAL LAWHow Code amended repealed or

and express in the title of the amendatory act the number and subject of such chapter if the provision of such amendment by reenactment or by additional section or sections is germane to the subject of the chapter 6 CONSTITUTIONAL LAWTitle of actobject of taxeamendatory  An amendatory act which merely continues a tax which has been imposed by a previous act without stating the object to which the tax is to be applied is not repugnant to Sec 16 Art X of the Constitution if the original act which imposed the tax states the object to which it was to be applied And this is true although the amendatory act does not purport to amend the original act but the Code into which the original act was incorporated 7 CONSTITUTIONAL LAWTitle of actobject of tar The title of an act which imposes a tax sufficiently defines the object to which the tax is to be applied within the meaning of Sec 16 Art X of the Constitution when it declares it to be to obtain revenue Error to a judgment of the County Court of Gloucester county ren dered on the 10th day of March 1894 sustaining the defendants de murrer to an indictment for failure to make a true and accurate return of sales of oysters made by him Reversed Opinion states the case R Taylor Scott AttorneyGeneral for the Commonwealth J N Stzbbs and Wm C L Taliaferro for the defendant in error RIELY J delivered the opinion of the court Section 5 of the Act of the General Assembly approved February 25 1892 entitled An Act to amend and reenact sections 2131 2133 2134 2135 2137 2148 2151 2153 and to repeal sections 2141 2142 2143 2144 2145 and 2147 of chapter 97 of the Code of Virginia in re lation to oysters and to add independent sections thereto Acts 189192 chap 363 p 595 contains the following provision  The inspector shall require each tongman registered in his district to make to him on the Saturday of each week or within three days thereafter during the lawful season a true and accurate return of the amount of sales made by him during the week preceding and the in spector shall collect from said tongman on the aggregate amount of sales for that week an amount equal to the amount of tax that may be levied by the State on any other species of property but if at the time of registering his boat any tongman shall prefer and elect to pay and pay to the inspector the sum of two dollars the inspector shall give him a receipt therefor in which he shall state that the said pay 1895 105VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER ment is a discharge of his obligation under this section for the entire season for which his boat is registered so far as the weekly returns and the amount to be paid thereon is concerned  If any tong man shall fail to make such report as is provided in this section he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof he shall be fined not less than ten dollars nor more than fifty dollars Iverson Brown the defendant in error who was a tongman of oys ters and had not elected at the time of registering his boat to pay to the inspector the sum of two dollars in discharge of his obligation for the entire season was indicted under the said statute in the County Court of Gloucester on the 5th day of October 1893 for failing to make the return which was due from him to the inspector on the week ending September 16 1893 or within the three days thereafter of the amount of his sales of oysters To the indictment the defendant demurred The court sustained the demurrer and gave judgment for the defendant Upon a petition by the Commonwealth to the Judge of the Circuit Court of Gloucester county for a writ of error to the said judgment there was a pro forma refusal in pursuance of an agreement between the attorney for the Commonwealth and for the defendant in order that the case might be promptly brought before this court A writ of error was thereupon granted by one of the judges of this court By an agreement in writing and filed with the record all errors and objections to the indictment except as to the validity of thestatute upon which it was based were waived by the counsel for the defendant The only question then for our consideration is the constitutionality of the statute above quoted It is first assailed on the ground that the tax prescribed is not equal and uniform and that therefore the statute is obnoxious to Section 1 Article X of the Constitution In support of this contention quite a number of objections to the act were urged Section 1 Article X of the Constitution prescribes that Taxa tion except as hereinafter provided whether imposed by the State county or corporate bodies shall be equal and uniform and all prop erty both real and personal shall be taxed in proportion to its value to be ascertained as prescribed by law No one species of property from which a tax may be collected shall be taxea higher than any other species of property of equal value An inspection of the statute under consideration shows that the principle of equality and uniformity was strictly observed in the im 106 JuneCOMMONWEALTH V BROWN position of the tax The value of the oysters for taxation could not well be ascertained or fixed in a more just manner than is prescribed by the statute It is to be ascertained by the aggregate amount of sales each week during the oyster season It is their actual value in market and not merely their appraised value A more accurate mode of ascertaining the valuation for taxation of oysters subject to be taxed could not well be devised and the rate of taxation is precisely the same as is prescribed for other property The inspector is to collect each week from a tongman on the aggregate amount of his sales for that week an amount equal to the amount of tax that may be levied by the State on any other species of property no more no less The tax prescribed is exactly the same as that which is levied by the State on any other species of property and the valuation is ascertained in the most accurate and just manner There is no just ground to com plain of the tax for inequality or want of uniformity It is objected that the valuation for taxation of oysters is not ascer tained in the same way or by the same method that is prescribed for other property that the valuation of other property is assessed by officers elected or appointed for the purpose that the tax on oysters is to be assessed and paid weekly while all other property is only as sessed annually and the tax paid annually and that the failure of a tongman to make weekly a return of his sales to the inspector is made a misdemeanor and subjects him on conviction to the payment of a fine while the owners of other property subject to taxation are not liable to be punished for a like delinquency Neither one nor all of these objections affect the equality or uni formity of the tax imposed on a tongman nor offend against Section 1 Article X of the Constitution Whether true or false they do not operate to impose any greater burden on him than is borne by the owner of any other species of property of the same value They do not add one iota to the tax he has to pay and the statute is therefore in strict accord with both the letter and spirit of the Constitution in the respect complained of The Constitution does not prescribe that the valuation of all property for taxation shall be ascertained in the same way or manner It is not even implied In the nature of things it could not be done The many kinds or species of property with their diverse characteristics render it impossible The valuation is to be ascertained as prescribed by lawthat is by the Legislatureand in as just a manner as possi ble and on such valuation the same rate of tax shall be imposed as on 1895 107VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER other property so that no species of property    shall be taxed higher than any other species of property of equal value The requirement of equality and uniformity is satisfied by such regula tions as will secure an equal rate and a just valuation without refer ence to the method of valuation and in order to be uniform a tax need not be imposed and assessed upon all property by the same agency or officer Shenandoah Val R Co v Supervisors of Clarke Co 78 Va 269 Kentucky Railroad Tax Cases 115 U S 337 338 Central Iowa Ry Co v Board of Suprs 67 Iowa 199 and Louisville  N A R Co v State 25 Ind 177 The Legislature may prescribe any method it may deem best for attaining a just and fair valuation of any species of property and the court could not declare any such law void unless it manifestly violated the principles required by the Constitution The fact that oysters are required to be assessed and the tax to be paid every week while other property is only assessed and the tax paid once a year does not work inequality in the amount of the tax paid The tonglman does not pay weekly on the same property In the re sult he only pays on the aggregate amount of his sales during the season the regular pro rata tax that is paid on all other property The fact that he pays the tax in weekly installments instead of one annual payment does not increase the amount of his tax one stiver The amount to be paid to the State is precisely the same whether paid in one single payment or in weekly installments It is claimed that the tax in question being assessed on the aggre gate amount of sales of oysters is an income tax and is therefore violative of Section 4 Article X of the Constitution which exempts incomes under 600 from taxation It is a sufficient answer to this objection to say that the tax is assessed on sales and not upon income and that the section of the Constitution referred to has no application to the case and furthermore that the tax on the  amount of sales of oysters  taken from their natural beds is expressly authorized by Section 2 of the said article of the Constitution It is further objected that because the act subjects a tongman to a fine of not less than 10 nor more than 50 if he fail to make to the inspector the required weekly return of sales it discriminates against the tongman as no other owner of property subject to taxation is liable to a fine for a like delinquency If this were in fact true it would not be cause to declare the statute void for inequality or want of uniformity in the tax imposed on tongmen of oysters It in no wise adds to or increases the tax That remains fixed and is the same that 108 JuneCOMMONWEALTH V BROWN is levied by the State on any other species of property If the tongmen respect the law by which the valuation of oysters for assess ment is to be ascertained they will never incur the fine A statute that is otherwise valid is not rendered invalid by having a penalty affixed for its violation The wrong of the citizen can never make a valid law void But the claim of discrimination is not founded in fact Owners of other property are subject to punishment for a like delinquency The penalty prescribed by the statute in question is for failing to make the return of sales to the inspector who is to assess the tax Under the general law forms for lists of valuations are furnished by the assessor to the owners of personal property which they are required to fill out by listing their property and affixing valuations thereof and which after being verified by oath are required to be returned to the assessor or clerk of the court within ten days thereafter and the fail ure to return the same within the time required and to make oath to its truth and fairness subjects the offender to a forfeiture of not less than 30 nor more than 1000 Code of Va sections 491 494 497 Statutes imposing penalties for failure or refusal to make such re returns or to return such lists are quite common and have been uni formly upheld cWashington v Commnonwealth 2 Va Cas 258 Con monwealth v Byrne 20 Gratt 165 State v Bell 1 Phil N C 76 Coinmonwealth v Cooke 50 Pa St 201 City of Hartford v Champion 58 Conn 268 and 25 Am  Eng Enc Law 206 Nor does the statute infringe in the least on the provision of the Constitution which authorizes a tax to be imposed on  the amount of sales of oysters taken from the natural beds by any citizen in any one year    at a rate not exceeding the rate of taxation im posed on any other species of property Article X section 2 It imposes as has been seen a tax on the weekly sales of oysters equal to the amount of the tax that may be levied by the State on any other species of property but provides that if at the time of registering his boat any tongman shall prefer and elect to pay and pay to the inspector the sum of two dollars the inspector shall give him a receipt therefor in which he shall state that the said payment is in discharge of his obligation under this section for the entire season for which his boat is registered so far as the weekly returns and the amount to be paid thereon is concerned It is insisted that this is in substance and effect a license tax and not a property tax and is therefore obnoxious to Section 2 Article X of the Constitution This claim is not well founded The Constitution expressly authorizes the Legislature to im 1895 109VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER pose a tax on the amount of sales of oysters taken from their natural beds by any citizen in any one year but limits the tax to the rate im posed upon any other species of property The statute pursuing directly the constitutional provision requires a tongman to make re turn to the inspector of the amount of his sales of oysters so taken and the inspector to collect from the tongman on the aggregate amount of sales an amount equal to the amount of tax levied by the State on other property Thus the tongman is required to pay on the amount of his sales as the Constitution authorizes and not otherwise and only such amount as is equal to the tax imposed by the State on other prop erty The statute does not therefore offend against the Constitution and it is difficult to see how it can be so claimed The provision that if the tongman at the time of registering his boat shall prefer and elect to pay and pay the sum of two dollars such payment shall be a discharge of his obligation for the entire sea son for the tax imposed on the amount of his sales is simply a privi lege extended to him which he may either accept or decline He is under no compulsion whatever to avail himself of it He is without cause of complaint on this score Nor unless accepted does it affect the tax imposed in strict adherence to the constitutional provision We have now disposed of the many objections raised to the consti tutionality of the statute on the ground of inequality or want of uni formity in the tax it imposes and the objection that it is a license and not a property tax It is in our opinion valid against such attack It is next contended that it is repugnant to Section 15 Article V of the Constitution which is as follows No law shall embrace more than one object which shall be expressed in its title nor shall any law be revived or amended with reference to its title but the act revived or the section amended shall be reenacted and published at length The title of the act was stated at the beginning of this opinion but for convenience in examining the objection made to its validity or sufficiency under the foregoing provision of the Constitution it will be here repeated It is entitled An act to amend and reenact sections 2131 2133 2134 2135 2137 2148 2151 2153 and to repeal sec tions 2141 2142 2143 2144 2145 and 2147 of chapter 97 of the Code of Virginia in relation to oysters and to add independent sec tions thereto It is claimed that the body of the statute embraces many objects instead of one object as required by the constitutional provision and further that these many objects are not expressed in the title that it 110 June1895 COMMONWEALTH V BROWN 111 both amends and repeals many sections of the Code and that the in dependent sections have various objects such as registering boats to be used in taking oysters from their natural beds arranging oyster dis tricts surveying oysterplanting ground assigning and renting oyster ground tax on sales of oysters taken from their natural beds and other similar provisions and it is contended that the title should have stated and shown what subject each section as amended and reenacted had reference to what subject each section repealed had reference to and that the subjectmatter in the independent sections should have been clearly set forth in the title The provision of the Constitution is a wise and wholesome one Its purpose is apparent It was to prevent the members of the Legisla ture and the people from being misled by the title of a law It was intended to prevent the use of deceptive titles as a cover for vicious legislation to prevent the practice of bringing together into one bill for corrupt purposes subjects diverse and dissimilar in their nature and having no necessary connection with each other and to prevent sur prise or fraud in legislation by means of provisions in bills of which the titles gave no intimation And on the other hand it was not intended to obstruct honest legisla tion or to prevent the incorporation into a single act of the entire statutory law upon one general subject It was not designed to em barrass legislation by compelling the multiplication of laws by the passage of separate acts on a single general subject Although the act or statute authorizes many things of a diverse nature to be done the title will be sufficient if the things authorized may be fairly regarded as in furtherance of the object expressed in the title It is therefore to be liberally construed and treated so as to uphold the law if practi cable Cooley Const Lim p 175 All that is required by the con stitutional provision is that the subjects embraced in the statute but not specified in the title are congruous and have natural connection with or are germane to the subject expressed in the title This has been so far as we are aware the construction given this provision of the Constitution by this court by the highest courts of other States whose constitutions contain the same or a similar provision and by the Supreme Court of the United States Powell v Supervisors 88 Va 707 Lescallett v Cor 89 Va 878 State v Town of Union 33 N J Law 350

113 U S 142 and Unity v Burrage 103 U S 457459 It is very plain that the subjects of the various sections of the act under consideration are not dissimilar or discordant but have natural connection with each other and relate to the general subject oysters expressed in the title They are all the means to an end They are instrumentalities for the accomplishment of the general object of the act No one interested in the subjectmatter of the statute could be misled by the title or be put off his guard by hearing it read by the title Under the just and fair interpretation that has been uni formly given to the provision of Section 15 Article V of the Consti tution the title to the act in question is sufficient and it was unnecessary to set forth in it the various subjects of its different sections which would have indeed made the title what the constitutional provision never intended to require an abstract of the law or an index of its contents There is another view which may be urged in support of the suffi ciency of the title It will be observed that it is an amendatory act and not the original act on the subject In such case if the title of the original act is sufficient to embrace the matters covered by the pro visions of the act amendatory thereof it is unnecessary to inquire whether the title of the amendatory act would of itself be sufficient If the title of the original act is sufficient to embrace the matters contained in the amendatory act whether that of the amendatory act is in itself sufficient is unimportant State v Ranson 73 Mo 78 City of St Louis v Tiefel 42 Mo 590 Brandon v State 16 Ind 197 Monford v Unger 8 Iowa 82 State v Algood 87 Tenn 163 and Yellow River Improvement Co v Arnold 46 Wis 214 224 The act in question is amendatory of chapter 97 of the Code of Vir ginia on Oysters This chapter contains and embraces the statute law on the subject of oysters enacted in Acts 188384 chap 254 p 324 as revised by the revisors of that Code and the section under which the defendant in error was indicted was in substance contained in section 8 of said act and was incorporated in the Code as section 2142 That section of the Code is repealed by Acts 189192 chap 363 p 595 and section 5 enacted in its place as an independent sec tion We have already set forth the said section at length Is it ger mane to the subject expressed in the title of the act of 188384 referred to Would it have been legitimately covered by its title The title was as follows An act for the preservation of oysters and to obtain 112 JuneCOMMONWEALTH V BROWN revenue for the privilege of taking them within the waters of the Com monwealth  These questions can only be answered in the affirmative Section 2142 of the Code taken from the original act of 1883 84 and incorporated into the Code by the revisors and the independent section under discussion numbered 5 of the act of 1891 92 relate directly and expressly to the object expressed in the title of the original act This cannot be questioned And being fully covered by it the title of the amendatory act of 1891 92 is a sufficient compliance with the constitu tional requirement It may however be said that the act in question did not purport to amend the original act of 188384 but to amend and reenact and repeal various sections of chapter 97 of the Code of Virginia and add other sections to it This is true and it is also true that the revisors of the Code 1887 incorporated into it the provisions of the act of 188384 and that the sections so amended and reenacted and those repealed were mainly taken by the revisors from the said act But the fact that the act purports to amend the Code instead of the original act so far from invalidating it is an additional reason why it is not obnoxious to the Constitution in respect to the matter of its title The laws contained in the present Code where enacted before and the great body of them very long before they were incorporated into it They were taken from previous codes and compilations of the general laws and from statutes passed subsequent to such codes and compila tions It is to be presumed that they were constitutionally enacted as well as to the title as in other respects They were collated revised and digested under appropriate titles and chapters and divided into sections in pursuance of an act of the legislature and then passed by it as one act under a proper title with the object of the act therein duly expressed An act to revise arrange and consolidate into a Code the general statutes of the Commonwealth approved May 16 1887 in strict compliance with the Constitution It was not to amendments of general statutes thus consolidated into a Code that Section 15 of Article V of the Constitution was intended to apply but it was aimed at the separate acts in their original enactment when the opportunity existed for the evils and the mischief to be done which the constitutional provision was designed to prevent or defeat It is not necessary therefore to do more if so much in amending and reenacting or repealing any part of the Code or adding thereto than refer to the proper chapter and section thereof to be amended or re pealed or added to and adopt and express in the title of the amenda 1895 113VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER tory act the number and subject of such chapter if the provision of such amendment by reenactment or by additional section or sections is germane to the subject of the chapter Second German Building Asso ciation v Newman 50 Md 62 Lankford v Commissioners 73 Md 105 Heath v Johnson 36 W Va 782 Dogge v State 17 Neb 140 State v Berka 20 Neb 375 People v Howard 73 Mich 10 and People v Parvin Cal 14 Pac 783 The chapter of the Code whose sections are affected by the act in question is numbered 97 and  Oysters  is expressed tobe its subject The act whose constitutionalty is questioned refers in its title to that chapter by number and uses its title and as we have previously shown the provisions of all the sections of the act relate directly and expressly to the subject Oysters It is not therefore in conflict with the Constitution The Constitution of Maryland contains a similar provision to that of our own and the Court of Appeals of that State has held that in amend ing its code of laws which is divided into Articles it is sufficient to refer to the number of the Article The subject of its ninetyfifth Article is Usury under which is contained the whole legislation of the State regulating the rate of interest declaring the penalties and forfeitures for usury and prescribing the manner in which such for feitures shall be enforced The Legislature of Maryland passed an act amending the said Article under the title An act to amend Article ninetyfive of the Code of Public General Laws by adding an additional section thereto Laws 1876 p 601 In Second German Building Association v Newman supra the act was assailed as repugnant to the Constitution but the court held that the title of the act complied with the constitutional provision requiring the subject of an act of Assembly to be described in its title and added that it was not necessary to state in the title that the section to be added to the Code related to the subject of usury The reference to the particular Article in the Code which relates only to the subject of usury clearly indicated the subject of the law The act drawn in question in Heath v Johnson supra was en titled An act to amend An act to amend and reenact section 58 of chapter 45 of the Code of West Virginia It was objected to on account of the insufficiency of its title but the court held otherwise and said The provision cited seems to refer rather to original acts than to those which are only amendatory but supposing it to apply to the latter when the amendment in its title points not only to the 114 JuneCOMMONWEALTH V BROWN chapter which is to be amended but to the very section it seems to us to amount to a sufficient expression of the object of the law to prevent any of the evils which the constitutional provision was intended to remedy The title of the act which was questioned in People v Howard supra reads as follows An act to amend chapter 153 of the Revised Statutes of 1846 being chapter 180 of the Compiled Laws entitled of offenses against the lives and property of individuals  Laws 1867 p 153 The amendment consisted in adding to the chapter a new section In its opinion the court said It is claimed that the object of the act which was to create a new felony is not expressed in the title that an amendment means a change or alteration in some thing already existing and does not mean creation or the bringing in of substantially new matter and that the precise purpose of the act should have been clearly stated in the title    Acts entitled Acts to amend a named act are not obnoxious to the Constitution if the amendment comes fairly within the scope of the title of the original act Nor would the amendment of a compilers section if the sub jectmatter of the section was expressed in the title But it is said that the chapters and sections of the Compiled Laws have no titles the titles being placed there by the compilers and not by the Legislature When the chapters are referred to and they are identical in sections and the title as used by the compiler is substantially stated and an amendment is proposed to such chapter the public are notified that a change is proposed in the law relating to the class of offenses treated of in such chapters and that amendments may always be made by adding a new section as an act is amended by adding a new section It is further contended that the act is unconstitional because it im poses a tax without stating the tax or the object of it and is therefore repugnant to Section 16 Article X of the Constitution which pro vides that every law which imposes continues or revives a tax shall distinctly state the tax and the object to which it is to be applied and it shall not be sufficient to refer to any other law to fix such tax or object So far as we are aware this particular provision of the Constitution has not heretofore been reviewed by this court It was not in any Constitution of the State prior to 1869 It appears there for the first time It is true that the act contains a tax Is it distinctly stated  It is 1895 115VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER prescribed to be an amount equal to the amount of tax that may be levied by the State on any other species of property It is made ex actly the same as that which is imposed on other property Tong men are required to pay the same tax on the fair value of the oysters taken and sold by them that is paid by others on other property of the same value The tax is accurately prescribed It is not open to mis take or doubt It is in the sense of the Constitution distinctly stated The act specifically and definitely fixes the amount of the tax and in this respect complies with the letter and purpose of the constitutional provision Next as to the object of the tax It is claimed that this is new leg islation and not an amendment of a former law but the enactment of a new section and that therefore it imposes a tax But this is a mis take It does not impose a new tax It simply continues a tax al ready existing and in force when the act was passed The very act which prescribes the tax repeals a section of the Code taken from the act of 188384 chapter 254  8 which fixed the same tax It is simply the substitution by the same act of another section for the original section both containing the same tax The act therefore instead of imposing a tax simply continues it AVe have already seen in discussing the objection to the title of the act that where an act is amendatory of an original act and the title of the original act is sufficient to cover the matter of the amendment it is sufficient and the title of the amendatory act becomes unimportant For the same reason where an amendatory act merely continues a tax without stating the object to which it is to be applied it will be a com pliance with the constitutional provision if the original act which im posed the tax states the object to which it was to be applied Under the Constitution the title is a necessary part of every statute The tax which the act in question continues was imposed by the act of 188384 We have only to refer to that act to find a satisfactory answer to the constitutional objection now urged It is entitled An act for the preservation of oysters to obtain revenue for the privilege of taking them within the waters of the Commonwealth The object of the tax is concisely but expressly stated It is to obtain revenue What is  revenue  It is the income which a State collects and re ceives into its treasury and is appropriated for the payment of its ex penses The object of the act then was to raise money for the support of the government of the State It is concisely defined by the words to  obtain revenue but by that phrase the object of the tax is as popu 116 JuneCOMMONWEALTH V BROWN larly understood as if it had been declared in the title or body of the act that the object was to raise money for the current expenses of the Government While the act of 189192 does not purport to amend the act of 188384 but the Code yet it is that act as put into the Code which is in reality amended It cannot be necessary in an amendment which continues a tax contained in the original act without changing the ob ject of the tax to repeat the object The statement of it in the original act is sufficient It appears from section 2135 of chapter 97 of the Code where the act of 188384 was incorporated into it that each inspector of oysters is required to pay all taxes on sales of oysters together with all fees and fines collected by him  into the public treasury to the credit of the oyster fund This section as amended and reenacted by the act of 189192 uses the same language The oyster fund here referred to is merely an account that shows upon the credit side the amount of taxes rents fees and fines derived from oysters and upon the debit side the expenses incurred in sustaining the means furnished by law for their preservation and obtaining revenue from them It is simply kept for the information of the Executive of the State the General Assembly and the public in order that it may be conveniently seen whether oys ters are a source of revenue to the State and if so to what extent It has no reference to the object of the tax and in no wise alters or affects its object as expressed in the title of the act of 188384 or diverts the moneys received under the tax from the payment of the ordinary and current expenses of the State The tax is distinctly stated in the act And there can be no mis understanding or doubt as to the object to which it is to be applied The law is valid The constitution of New York contains the same provision in the same identical words It has been construed more than once by the courts of that State and liberally interpreted It came before the Supreme Court of New York in People v Super visors of Orange Co 27 Barb 575 where the act prescribed that the money raised should be paid into the treasury of the State to the credit of the general fund It was objected that this was not a suffi cient statement of the object to which the tax was to be applied as re quired by the Constitution but the court hleld otherwise and declared the act valid An appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals of New 1895 117VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER York which affirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court Id 17 N Y 235 It was again before the Supreme Court of New York in the case of People v National Fire Insurance Co 27 Hun 188 where the act specified that the taxes shall be applicable to the payment of the ordinary and current expenses of the State It was held that this sufficiently stated the object of the tax These decisions show that under a reasonable and fair interpretation of this provision of the Constitution it is sufficient to indicafe generally the purpose to which the tax is to be applied otherwise it would be necessary after having stated the tax and the fund to which when collected and paid into the treasury it is to be credited to go further and specify the persons to whom and the purposes for which it should be disbursed It was well said by the court in one of the cases cited above that if this were necessary every tax bill would then be an appropriation bill alsoa requirement that would be of infinite em barrassment to the Government and practically deprive the Legislature of all power to raise money by taxation Every law enacted by the Legislature is presumed to be in conformity with the Constitution until the contrary is shown and it devolves on him who alleges its invalidity to show it It is a grave responsibility for a court or judge to pronounce a solemn and deliberate act of the sover eign lawmaking power unconstitutional and void It should never be done in a doubtful case and especially where no great principle of liberty or the security of property  enshrined in the Constitution of the United States and repeated in that of the State  is involved but only some rule of legislative action When it is done the conflict between the Constitution and the law must be clear and palpable To doubt is to affirm the validity of the law The statute which has been assailed on so many constitutional grounds is not at least to our minds in plain and palpable conflict with the Constitution The result is that the judgment of the County Court of Gloucester county must be reversed and annulled and the demurrer to the indict ment overruled Reversed BY THE EDITORThis is among the most important cases ever decided by our Court of Appeals on the construction of the Constitution of Virginia The de cision was not hastywithout the consideration its importance demanded The opinion of the court delivered by Judge Riely shows that all the questions in volved were most deliberately carefullyindeed anxiouslyand fully examined and considered The propositions laid down are ably discussed and most abun 118 JuneAM MANG CO V VA MANG CO dantly supported by reason and authority and we venture the prediction that the case will be a leading and controlling one in the construction of the constitu tional provisions passed upon We are especially delighted with the liberal and sensible rule laid down for the construction of Sec 15 Art V of the Constitution in its application to legis lative amendments of the Code Any more restricted rule would be attended with incalculable mischief The Code of Virginia is one act with appropriate title It is divided into chapters and these are subdivided into sections numbered consecutively from beginning to end The headings of the chapters show the subjects of them and so of the sections It cannot therefore be necessary in order to comply with the constitutional requirement as to title in amending any part of the Code to do more than to refer in the title of the amendatory act to the particular section or sections not necessarily to the chapter or chapters of the Code to be amended The section or sections referred to will show the subject And if the amendment is not incongruous with the original section or sections the title will be sufficient We hail this decision with the utmost delight AMERICAN MANGANESE CO LIM V VIRGINIA MANGANESE CO Virginia Court of Appeals

j100195,The Jewish Quarterly Review,1450485,Gollanczs Syriac Charms,i263159,CRITICAL NOTICES 695 chapter This was a very wise proceeding since not only are there differences in the wording of both classes of the headings but those placed at the beginnings of the chapters undoubtedly claim greater authenticity It is however questionable whether Dr Cohn was welladvised to reproduce his abstracts from the Arabic text exactly as he found them in the MSS without adding any diacritical points not to speak of such luxuries as Hamza and TashdTd The omission of the two dots on the i is not even carried through with consistency In editions meant for European students it is at least advisable to adhere to the customary critical apparatus For if the editor of a text wishes to convey the authors pronunciation transcription into Latin characters becomes necessary Dr Cohn has also omitted to translate the Arabic portions of his essay with the exceptions of a few passages and the abovementioned headings In the latter I would suggest a few corrections P 7 4 does not mean Bedeutung but obligation ibid llY J6l remains untranslated P 8 ch xi read JLxL LJ 1J and ibid Jl1 stands for Heb RtrD and refers to the unclean person This is also the case p ix 11 3 and 5 and in other places and affects the translation of the corresponding passage on p 41 In the same passage read und dass for und wenn because the Arabic word is not i but j1  I omit minor slips in the same passage P 9 ch xxii yjJ J 5J does not refer to Todtung eines lebenden Wesens but to homicide P Io ch xxix als Folge der Enthaltsamkeit should be durch Abhaltung derselben von jeglichem Genusse c Ibid ch xxx Jl is not die Opfer but the animal slaughtered or prepared for sacrifice P I5 read 1J as also in Cod L The same is the case with jiiAJ p I6 the word has only run together with the one written underneath The text of ch x is otherwise treated with care especially as regards the selection of the best reading It is to be hoped that Dr Cohn will continue to turn his attention to the much neglected SamaritanArabic literature as it possesses an interest of its own H HIRSCHFELD GOLLANCZS SYRIAC CHARMS A Selection of Charms from Syriac MSS by the Rev HERMANN GOLLANCZ MA pp 21 MR GOLLANCZS publication represents his contribution to the Proceedings of the Oriental Congress held in Paris in I897 It consists 3B2696 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW of a series of incantations and prayers taken from two Syriac MSS in his possession Although the essay is limited to a short introduc tion and the reproduction of the Syriac texts and translation of the specimens selected by him it gives a very good notion of the literary merit of the subject and it is to be hoped that Mr Gollancz will fulfil his promise of giving a complete edition of both MSS with a full introduction and explanatory notes It would be interesting to know and also to compare them with similar formulas eg the Mandaic incantations published last year by M Pognon It is hardly surprising that a Jewish element is also to be found in these charms eg p I3 Gabriel being on his right Michael on his left which recalls the passage in the Jewish night prayer as well as in the afternoon service of the Day of Atonement German rite The phrase was so popular among Jews that it found its way into Moslim tradition see Geiger Was hat Mzhammed c p I3 Mr Gollanczs translation is distinguished by great correctness and fluency of language There are only a few places where slight alterations might be made I would suggest p ii last paragr accursed ones sons of accursed fathers cruel ones the sons of a cruel man sing P 20 last line the two names should be read Jamblichos and Marielos With his sound knowledge of Syriac Mr Gollancz is sure to make the most of this interesting and rather uncommon subject H HIRSCHFELD

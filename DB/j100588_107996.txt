ILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS XII Magnetical Experiments made principally in the South part of Europe and in Asia Miinor during the years 1827 to 1832 By the Rev GEORGE FISHER AM FRS Received November 3 1832 Read January 24 1833 I Experiments to determine the relative Magnetic Forces soliciting a Magnetic Needle suspended horizontally THE forces were determined by a comparison of the number of vibrations made by several needles at each place They were vibrated in a box in the vertical sides of which were fixed narrow strips of glass having on each of them a fine vertical line drawn by means of a diamond by the coincidence or parallelism of these lines with the silk fibres by which the needles were suspended also by making their extremities coincide with two fixed points on the bottom of the box their horizontal position was insured The first semi arc of vibration was ten degrees and the last two As the magnetism of needles is increased as the temperature is dimi nished and vice versa it becomes necessary to reduce the experiments to the same standard But since the law or relation existing between the changes of temperature and the corresponding increments and decrements of the mag netic intensity is not precisely known and will moreover in some degree vary with the shape size c of the needles employed it is better to avoid as much as possible the necessity of any correction by making the experiments at nearly the same temperature The principal objection to the use of horizontal needles for the purpose of determining the comparative magnetic forces in the direction of the dipping MDCCCXXXIII 2 ITHE REV GEORGE FISHERS MAGNETICAL EXPERIMENTS needle arises from a knowledge of the dip being required For although they admit of great delicacy of suspension yet in high latitudes this objection is for obvious reasons insuperable and their use inadmissible for this purpose The determination of the forces in the direction of the dipping needle was also effected by direct experiment with three needles attached to an excellent dipping instrument made by DOLLOND The first semiarc of vibration in this instrument was 40 and the last 10 and the number of vibrations between these limits was generally about 80 with each needle Many observers I am aware are in the habit of observing the vibrations of their needles in much smaller arcs for the purpose of obtaining a greater number of vibrations as well as making the times of vibrations approach nearer to isochronisrn and thereby rendering corrections for the circular arcs less necessary Desirable as these objects are yet considerable experience in the use of these instruments has convinced me that very little reliance can be placed on the vibrations of needles when the total arcs described are less than about 20 Such at least has been the case with those which I have used which have been very nume rous and of the best construction To those much accustomed to experiments with dipping instruments and other instruments for magnetical purposes it may be needless to state the necessity of ascertaining by experiment that the metal of which they are con structed exerts no assignable influence on the needle at least such influence as may cause it to deflect from its true dipping position or in any way affect the time of its completing a given number of vibrations This can be readily ascertained by placing the instrument with the centrework removed if neces sary in a horizontal position and by suspending within it either one of the needles belonging to it or another of the same length by means of a long fibre of raw silk If it be found that the time of performing a given number of vibrations of the needle when thus placed within it is the sale as when the instrument is detached from it we may infer that no such influence exists To avoid the objection arising from the influence of metal upon the needles several dipping instruments have been constructed of late years of wood and card some of which are of the usual form and in others in order that the fric tion which arises from the transverse axes of the needles when vibrating upon agate edges may be removed the needles are supported by fibres of silk 238IN THE SOUTH PART OF EUROPE AND IN ASIA MINOR secured at each end of the axes by means of a small hook or notch which having the degree of tension necessary for its support and also by an arrange ment of the instrument resembling the equatorial movement of astronomical instruments the needles are made to vibrate in any plane at pleasure Inge nious as these contrivances are they are subject to several inconveniences and a very material one arises from the effects of temperature and humidity upon the frame and centrework of the instrument That which I had of this construction was in Levant and Siroc winds perfectly immovable from this cause which together with the effect of torsion rendered it little better than useless for the general purposes of a dipping instrument  and I could confirm these objections by the testimony and experience of an indefatigable observer employed on the coast of Africa I have been led to these remarks by having witnessed a considerable degree of disappointment expressed by several persons who in visiting foreign coun tries have lauldably endeavoured by their exertions to add somewhat to the present stock of information upon this subject and who have foundl upon their freturin tlat they havy in a ire t measure failed n the4r endeavours either ftom sorme imperfection in the construction of their instrutrscts or in the methods of using them and I cannot but considler that an unqualified com mendation of any instrument whatever intended for foreign service particu larly for those places which from many circumstances can rarely be visited without thoroughly examining its merits to be productive of considerable mis chief since it is not only the cause of error but tends to damp that zeal for the interests of science which travellers have it often in their power to promote As experiments of this nature are most frequently made at some of the prin cipal seaports immediately before the embarkation of the needles and at the same places upon their return in order that the intervals of time may be as short as possible which is desirable on account of the great variations which their intensities are subject to from rust and other causes and as other expe riments have generally been referred to London it becomes necessary to know the relative forces between these places that the requisite reductions may be made For this purpose a series of experiments were made during the last summer by Captain Sir EVERARD HOME Bart FRS near London and at South Sea Castle near Portsmouth With a similar view another series had 2 2 239THE REV GEORGE FISHERS MAGNETICAL EXPERIMENTS been previously made by myself at London and at Ryde four miles from South Sea Castle in 1830 The mean between both results is probably nearest the truth from which the horizontal force at London is to the same at Portsmouth as 1 to 1P01755 and the forces in the direction of the dipping needle as 1 to 100416 The dip at each place being 69 40 and 69 23 respectively Had the needles maintained precisely the same degree of magnetism during the whole period of these experiments the forces might be at once obtained by comparing those made at each place with corresponding ones made in London but as this was not the case and moreover from the causes just mentioned will seldom happen in long voyages it was necessary in this case to compare the experiments made at Gibraltar with those made at Lisbon and also those made in the various places in the Mediterranean and Asia Minor with corre sponding ones at Malta obtained by means of short runs from this latter place It is necessary to mention this since by otherwise combining the experiments different results may be obtained without attending to this circumstance Table I contains the comparative horizontal forces by a mean of four needles at each place with a small correction applied for diffirence of tempe rature The last column of this Table contains the same taking the horizontal force at London equal to unity Table II contains the comparative forces in the direction of the dipping needle determined by the experiments made with the horizontal ones and also the results obtained by direct experiment with the dipping needles The detail of the latter is omitted since they are of less authority than the others in consequence of their poles being constantly inverted for the purpose of obtaining the dip for though their magnetism was not interfered with between the consecutive experiments there was not that satisfactory evidence respecting any alteration in their intensities that possibly might have occurred during the intervals which is desirable the means of both methods are therefore omitted as the results would be vitiated by the same cause The dips contained in the column for that purpose are the mean results obtained with three needles that at Malta by a long series of experiments made in the years 18289 these were made not only for the purpose of deter mining the dip with all possible precision since the greater numnber of the experiments made in other parts were necessarily compared with those made 240IN THE SOUTH PART OF EUROPE AND IN ASIA MINOR at this place but also for the sake of comparing the dip obtained by the dif ferent methods of vibration with that obtained in the usual way The experi ments at Malta are given at the end of this paper In each of these experi ments the poles are inverted a precaution as essential in deternmining the dip by the methods of vibrations as in any other method II Experiments on the diurnal vartation in the intensity of the Force solicitig a Magnetic Needle suspended horizontally at Malta These experiments were first commenced on the 27th of November 1828 with the horizontal needle No 4 used in the foregoing observations and having the usual silk suspension It was firmly fixed on a strong table con structed for the purpose and placed in the centre of a large stone room in Valette beyond the direct influence of the suns rays and was vibrated in the box to which it was fitted The first semiarc of vibration was 100 and the last 2 and the time of completing one hundred vibrations was obtained by pro portion The times of commencing the 1st 3rd and 5th vibrations also the corresponding ones at the end of the experiment were observed as before with a chronometer by which three intervals were obtained in the same experi ment and a mean of them taken for the result The experiments were continued without intermission until the 24th of Janu ary following when I found upon examination that I was unable to trace the least appearance of any progression in the results as indicating a maxirnum or minimum or indeed any change whatever excepting what appeared to be the errors of experiment still I was induced to continue them until I had completed three hundred sets of vibrations at different periods of the day and night in hopes that having made so great a number of experiments and by taking a mean of all those made about the same time the small errors of observation would be so far eliminated as to indicate some result of this kind In this I was again disappointed as many of these means were nearly identical that is to the nearest tenth of a second It was evident therefore that the daily change of intensity if any existed was so exceedingly small as not to be apparent in experiments with this needle much less the periods of riaximum and minimum On the 25th of March following I began another series for the third timne 241THE REV GEORGE FISHERS MAGNETICAL EXPERIMENTS with a much larger needle one belonging to the dipping instrument and suspended by a single fibre of raw silk eighteen inches in length the first semi arc of vibration was reduced to 5 and the last semiarc to 2 and between these limits the number of vibrations was about two hundred and thirty In these the commencement of the 1st and every odd vibration to the 29th inclu sive were observed and at the end of the experiments the commencement of the 201st 203rd c to the 229th inclusive by this means the time of con pleting two hundred vibrations was obtained by a mean of fifteen independent observations In these as in the former ones very little progression appears in any one days experiments The differences indeed are so exceeding small as to ren der them in some degree a test of the regular going of the chronometer I will not however attempt to assign the degree of accuracy to which a chrono meter will measure so small an interval but merely observe that every pre caution was taken to insure accuracy by using alternately one of three chro nometers by ARNOLD which were wound up at different periods of the day A very small correction for the daily rate of each was applied In one of them which had the largest rate 12 the correction of the measured interval amounted to only one tenth of a second The following are the mean results taken as before about the same period of the day Time of 200 Therm No of Time me Vibrations FAHR Experiments h m 2 20 AM 85568 657 6 8 0 85527 651 18 10 30  85502 654 11 0 30 PM 85515 658 11 2 30

the means a regularity which was not visible in the former ones From these it appears that the least horizontal intensity took place about 2h AM and the greatest about 2h PM in April and May 1829 The variation is so very minute that I offer this conclusion with some diffidence though I have 242IN THE SOUTH PART OF EUROPE AND IN ASIA MINOR but little doubt that it will be confirmed by the subsequent experiments of others I regret that my own were not more extensive I have now to mention a source of irregularity which may possibly arise during a series of experiments of this nature and materially vitiate the results that is storms of thunder and lightning They cause as far as my experience goes in general a diminution in the magnetic intensity of the needles The observations just mentioned are fortunately exempt from this from a conti nuance of fine weather during the experiments I had reason on several occasions to suspect this but as I never had corre sponding experiments made immediately previous to a violent storm to com pare with siinilar ones made subsequently I was unable to assign with accu racy the period at which this diminution took place and thereby identify the cause A violent storm which took place at Malta on the 7th of December 1829 attended with considerable mischief afforded me this opportunity I had fortunately the day before made a great number of observations with all the needles for the sake of a comparison with similar ones that I intended to make in other parts of the Mediterranean to which I was about to proceed I availed myself therefore of the opportunity of ascertaining during the storm the effect produced upon the needles In the results which were obtained it appears that all of them were affected in a similar way that is they all suf fered a permanent diminution of their intensities III On the diurnal Oscillations in the direction of a Magnetic Needle sus pended horizontally at Malta The needle employed in these experiments was twelve inches in length Every precaution was taken to avoid the influence of iron and to secure the whole apparatus from damp and to equalize the temperature around it it was fixed and the needle adjusted within it six weeks before an observation was registered The radius of the arc described by the needle was increased from six to ten inches by light pieces of cedar attached to each end of it and carrying upon their extremities small pieces of ivory extending to about 4 of arc and sub divided to every 5 Opposite to each end of these divided extremities were 243THE REV GEORGE FISHERS MAGNETICAL EXPERIMENTS placed three vertical hairs at the distance of 1 apart and as near to them as could be without touching them The coincidence of these vertical lines with the divisions on the white ground of the ivory behind was observed with ex treme distinctness by means of a compound microscope By this means the subdivisions of 5 were again subdivided to single minutes and by a mean of the six which constituted an observation to within a few seconds The observations were commenced on the 5th of January 1829 and carried on every hour from 9h AM to 411 PM to the 21st of the same month during this period a maximum occurred in the westerly variation at Ohl 30m PM nearly They were recommenced on the 24th of March following and continued until the 31st and the needle observed every halfhour with a few exceptions from 7h AM to 4h PM during this interval the maximum occurred at about 1h 3O PM and the minimum at 911 30 AM These results are obtained by taking the means of all the observations made at the same hour and considering these means as representing the true variation at those hours They are con tained in a Table at the end of the paper On the 1st of April another series was commenced and continued to the 15th They were made from 711 AM to 41 30m PoM every halfhour and as frequently during the night as could con veniently be done considering the great labour and want of rest attending experiments of this nature particularly as they were accompanied by corre sponding observations of the times of vibration of another needle From these it appealrs that the maximum westerly variation takes place about Ih 45m PM from this period of the day it gradually diminishes until about 10oh Om PM from about this time to about sunrise it is nearly stationary after this period a still further diminution takes place and the minimum west erly variation happens at about 8h 45m AM when it again increases to about 1h 45m PM and reaches its maximum as before The difference between the mean maximum and minimum variation or the mean amount of the diurnal movement of the needle in April was 10 12 During these observations several oscillations or tremulous motions in the needle were observed and as they are occasionally registered by others I men tion three days on which they were most apparent January 15 1829 at 10oh 30mn AM the north end of the needle moved to the westward about 2 15 in ten minutes the needle exceedingly tremulous from this period of the 244IN THE SOUTH PART OF EUROPE AND IN ASIA MINOR 245 day it moved gradually back to the eastward until 3 PM when it again moved suddenly 2 to the westward and shortly afterwards back again to the eastward The mean variation on this day was less than usual On the 26th of March 1829 at 311 PM the needle was very tremulous and on the 29th fol lowing at 8h and 9h PM oscillated considerably IV Experiments on the bases and edges of the craters of Vesuvius and Etna and also on Gibraltar Rock and the neutral ground below It has been observed by Baron HUMBOLDT in describing his experiments to determine the magnet dip that the heights of the places of observation seem to have a sensible influence on the results and moreover that the magnetic forces appear to be modified by the proximity of lavas He found at Cumana the capital of New Andalusia that the dip before the earthquake was invaria bly 43065 cent div but he was astonished to find three days after the violent shocks of earthquake that it was no more than 42075 and a year afterwards still 42080 although the intensity of the magnetic forces had not varied the whole time With respect to the influence of height he observes that BORDA is the only traveller who has compared in an accurate manner the dip at Santa Cruz with that determined at the top of the Peak of Teneriffe where he found it greater than at the bottom which result Baron HUMBOLDT observes was exactly con formable to what he has several times obtained among the Andes and he suggests that it probably depends upon some system of local attraction  It appears also from a manuscript account of BORDAS voyage to the Canaries that he found the card attached to his horizontal needle made a given number of vibrations in 97 at the summit of the Peak while at Santa Cruz bearing E 290 N it was 94 indicating a less intensity on the sum mit than at the bottom At the brink of the crater he observed the westerly variation to be 19 40 at Santa Cruz 15 50 and at Gomera 150 45 which observations indicate aconsiderable deflec tion of the needle from the magnetic meridian arising from some disturbing force HANSTEEN found the force soliciting a needle on the top of the round tower at Copenhagen at the height of one hundred and twentysix feet to be much less than in a garden below which he ascribes to polarity in the building Similar experiments made at the Pagoda at Kew which is a brick build ing of the same height by Professor RIGAUD Sir EvEEARD HOME Bart and myself give no such result nor indicate any assignable difference either in the dip or in the magnetic force whether ob served on the top or at the bottom MDCCCXXXIII 2 KTHE REV GEORGE FISHERS MAGNETICAL EXPERIMENTS From whatever cause these differences proceed wheter from the attraction of lavas containing iron ores from the inflrence o height alone or from both causes conjointly it is evident that while such extraordinary discrepancies exist either in the direction of the needle or in the intensity of the force soli citing it it will be impossible to reconcile the results of magnetical experi ments by means of mathematical formulae With a view of observing these anomalies in experiments of this nature as well as to gratify my own curiosity I was induced to make similar ones on Vesuvius Etna aand Gibraltar Rock The experinments at Vesuvius indicate a remarkable difference in the variation observed on the top and at the bottom By the suns azimuth at the crater variation     12 19 W By the bearing of St Francazzo at the crater variation  12 52  Arcera at the crater variation   12 512 Mean variation at the crater    12 25 By a great number of observations in the neighbourhood of Baia and Naples the westerly variation by the same instrument was 15 203 differing 30 from that observed on the crater at the height of 3400 feet The magnetic force on the western edge of the crater was the same as that observed at Naples That observed halfway up the mountain at the hermi tage on the west side was a little less Onthtatr the southeastern edge o te crater of Etna at the height of 11000 feet the westerly variation by means of the suns azimuth was 18 35 west At Catania on the southern foot of the mountain it was 16 28 and at Mes sina on the northeastern side it was 170 12 with the same instrument The magnetic force on the crater of Etna was much greater than either at Catania or at Messina both with a horizontal needle and one in the direction of the dipping needle At Gibraltar the experiments on the summit at the height of 1300 feet indicate a greater intensity than on the neutral ground below though one of the needles probably from some error of observation appeared to give dis cordant results The different periods of vibration are given with the other experiments in a Table at the end of the paper 246IN THE SOUTH PART OF EUROPE AND IN ASIA MINOR 247 Upon reviewing the observations made in different parts of the Mediterra nean contained in this paper a great irregularity will be seen in the numerical results In proceeding from Malta to Naples by way of Etna and Messina it appears that an increase of the whole magnetic force took place in the first half of the distance which we might have expected but from Messina to Ve suvius and Naples a considerable diminution of the intensity was observed whereas from their relative geographical positions we nmight have concluded otherwise Upon the whole as we proceed eastward as far as Constantinople there appears to be a decrease in the intensities at places having the same dip similar to what has been observed in the western hemisphere if we except the observations at Naples and Vesuvius Whether these irregularities arise from any inequalities in the distribution of the terrestrial magnetism or from any active agency of a volcanic nature I dare hardly venture an opinion The deflections or deviations of the needle from the magnetic meridian on the summits of Vesuvius and Etna confirm the latter idea although on the other hand experiments made in several places in the neighbourhood of Vesuvius from their near agreement with each other indicate nothing of the kind It will not however appear very extraordinary that volcanic products should exert considerable influence on the needle when we consider how very gene rally iron ores enter into the composition of the different lavas Upon sub mitting each specimen contained in a collection of lavas made by SALVADORE the Vesuvian guide to a light needle suspended by a fibre of silk I found that sixtyeight out of one hundred and twentyfour specimens exerted consi derable influence upon it most of them attracting each end indiscriminately while others had decisive features of distinct polarity Whether the differ ence between the intensity on the summit of Etna and that observed below proceeds fromc the same cause or from the influence of height alone is alike difficult to determine248 THE REV GEORGE FISHERS MAGNETICAL EXPERIMENTS TABLE A Experiments to determine the dip at Malta by the usual

Ryan was declared duly elected The following communications were read 1  On the Saccharine Function of the Liver By GEORGE HARLEY MD FCS Professor of Medical Jurispru dence in University College London Communicated by Dr SHARPEY Sec RS Received Decernber 19 1859 Although it is nearly 200 years since our countryman the cele brated Dr Thomas Willis made the important discovery of the occasional presence of sugar in the human urine it was not until very recently known that the formation of saccharine matter is con stantly going on in the healthy animal body Since Bernard in 1848 communicated to the French Academy the discovery of the saccharine function of the animal organism physiologists in all countries have more or less directed to it their attention For a time various opinions were held by different ob servers regarding the origin of the sugar found in the body but at length it was generally admitted that the liver had the power of forming a substance to which Bernard gave the name Glucogen that this peculiar substance was transformed into sugar and that the sugar in its turn disappeared in the capillaries of the different organs and tissues of the body In the summer of 1858 however Dr Pavy read a paper on the Alleged Sugarforming Function of the Liver  before the Royal Society the object of which was to prove that the presence of sugar in the animal economy is  due to a post mortem occurrencethat as long as life continues glucogen only is to be found and not until after death does the transformation of this substance into sugar begin The question of the saccharine fiunction of the liver being a sub ject to which I have more or less directed my attention since 1853 when I communicated to the Societe de Biologie de Paris an account of an experimental procedure whereby diabetes can be produced artificially in animals the abovementioned paper was to me one of pecuiliar interest The conclusions of the author were so much op posed to the results of my own experiments as well as those of other observers that I felt anxious to test themAccordingly having received the kinid offer of Professor Sharpevi cooperation I undertook a series of experiments the results of which I beg the honour of communicating to the Royal Society As the experiments performed were merely a repetition of some of those made by previous inquirers I shall not enter into detail further than is necessary to explain the precautions adopted with the view to avoid error And looking at the object in view it will readily be understood why in the present instance the tests employed for the detection of the sugar were limited to caustic potash with and without sulphate of copper The mode of proceeding was as follows In testing the blood a quantity of distilled water equial to about four times that of the blood used was boiled in a capsule To the water when boiling were added a few drops of acetic acid and afterwards the blood was very gradually introduced In order that the albumen might be thoroughly coagulated a drop or two more of acetic acid was added care being taken to avoid an excess When the albumen was completely coagulated which was known by its separating and floating in the clear liquid the whole was thrown on a filter The clear filtered liquid was then tested The same pro cess was followed when operating on the liver The first point to be ascertained was whether under favourable circumstances as regarded diet sugar could be found in the circula tion The following experiment proved this Exp 1 From the carotid artery of a rough terrier dog three houirs after being fed on bread milk and boiled liver a portion of blood equal to about threefourths of an ounce was withdrawn This on being treated in the manner explained gave distinct evidence of the presence of sugar A second portion of blood after standing thilrtyfive minutes in a room of moderate temperature yielded a similar result As in this instarnce a few seconds elapsed between the withdrawal of the first portion of blood and its treatment with the boiling acidu lated water and as it was possible that in these few seconds the sugar might have been formed from the glucogen present in the circulation we Professor Sharpey and myself thought it advisable in our next experiment to allow the blood to flow directly fromi the artery into the boiling mixture and thereby avoid the possibility of sugar being pro duced by the transformation of glucogen after the removal of the blood291 from the body It was further desired to operate on an animal in what might be considered its natural conditioln as to food Accord ingly one that had been running at large was selected and the following experiment performed Exrp 2 Into the left carotid artery of a small cocker dog was inserted a canula with a stopcock The animal was then placed so as to allow the blood to flow directly into the boiling acidulated water The clear filtered liquid from this blood became of a yellow tint on being boiled with soda and gave a red precipitate with the sulphate of copper and potash thereby indicating the presence of sugar Two ounces of blood from the same animal were similarly tested after the blood had stood twentyfour hours in a room of moderate temperature and the result obtained was the same as with the first portion The next experiment was made on an animal under conditions as regards food unfavourable for the production of sugar In order too to avoid any chance of injuring the sympathetic nerve during the operation and thereby favouring the formation of sugar in the body the blood was withdrawn from the right femoral artery instead of the carotid The following are the particulars of the experi ment Exp 3 A goodsized dog was fed solely on flesh during four days Three hours after the last meal which conisisted of half a poulnd of boiled horseflesh 1 oz of blood was permitted to flow from the femoral artery directly into the boiling mixture The solution obtained from this blood as in the other cases colntained sugar Another portion of blood after standing three hours was tested in the same way and as far as could be judged by the eye contained a similar proportion of stugar In neither of the preceding cases was the amount of sugar in the blood quantitatively determined as I had already done so on many previous occasions and I knew that in healthy arterial blood it varied according to the state of the digestion and the kind of food from an inappreciable quantity up to 024 per cent Having been now satisfied that sugar is to be found in the blood of healthy animals at the very moment of its withdrawal from the   On the Physiology of Saccharine Urine by Geo Harley MD British and Foreign Med Chir Rev July 1857 p 191204292 circulation even when none has been introduced along with the food we next proceeded to test the grounds upon which it had been asserted that glucogen is not transformed into sugar in the healthy liver during life In the paper already referred to Dr Pavy stated that the sudden abstraction of heat from the liver after its removal from the body checks the transformation of the sugarforming material and thereby enables us to operate on the hepatic substance while in the same chemical condition as during life The plan he recommends is to sacrifice a dog by pithing alnd instantly to slice off a piece of liver and throw it into a freezing mixture of ice and salt In which case he says the absence of sugar is almost complete and thence con cludes that the presence of sugar in the liver can no longer be looked upon as a  natural ante mortem condition but  is in reality due to a post mortem occurrence In the following experiments not only was the plan recommelnded most scrupulously followed but even the risk of the glucogen in the liver becoming transformed into sugar during the process of pre paring the decoction was avoided by cutting the frozen liver into thin slices and allowing them while still in that condition to fall directly into the boiling mixture of acetic acid and water The liver was in this way prevented from thawing until it entered a medium as capable of arresting the transformation of its glucogen into sugar as the cold The decoction so obtained might therefore be presumed to contain the soluble matters as nearly as possible in the same chemical state as they were in the living organ Exp 4 A small but fullgrown dog was fed during fourteen days solely on animal food Four hours after a meal of boiled horseflesh he was killed by section of the medulla oblongata The abdomen was rapidly opened and a portioll of liver cut off and instantly immersed in a freezing mixture of ice and salt A second portion of liver was as speedily as possible detached and quickly washed in cold water The latter portion was then without loss of time cut into fragments which were allowed to fall directly into boiling acidulated water On testing the clear filtrate distinct evi dence of the presence of sugar was obtained After half an hour the frozen portion of liver was taken without being allowed to thaw and sliced directly into the boiling water with acetic acid The293 clear liquLid yielded in this case as distinct evidence of sugar as in the other Forty minutes after the death of the animal another portion of liver which till then had remained undisturbed in the abdomen was treated like the others This gave evidence of containing a much greater quantity of sugar thus confirming Bernards statement that the transformation of glucogen goes on in the liver after its removal from the body or after the death of the animal In order to be perfectly certain that the sugar found in the liver at the instant of its removal from the body was really formed where it was found and not carried there by the portal blood from the food the following experiment was performed Exp 5 A dog was fed during ten days on boiled tripe Twenty two hours after the last meal the animal was pithed In less than twenty seconds a portion of the liver was in the freezing mixture of ice and salt While I boiled directly another portion of liver Professor Sharpey put a ligature on the portal vein and collected its blood He likewise collected some of the hepatic blood which flowed from the cut liver In the portal blood not a trace of sugar could be detected The hepatic blood on the other hand gave distinct evidence of its presence Both bloods were tested exactly alike The clear liquids obtained from the frozern liver and from the portion treated directly notwithstanding that they were filtered while hot and also tested while still hot both gave distinct evidence of sugar On the foliow ing day a second portion of portal blood which had been purposely kept all night in order to ascertain if on standing some time sugar would form in it still yielded the same negative result Even after treating it with saliva which would have transformed its glucogen into sugar had it contained any no evidence of the presence of sugar was obtained On the other hand when saliva was added to the decoctioiis of the liver above spoken of a great increase in the amount of sugar was observed The quantity of sugar so obtained did not appear to be so great however as that yielded by a portion of the liver which remained all night untouched in the abdomen of the aniimal Professor Garrod FRS who was present not at the commence ment of the experiment but on the followinig day when the different decoctions were tested agreed with Professor Sharpey and myself94 that this experiment showed the truith of Bernards statement that the liver might contain both sugar and glincogenl when the portal blood contained neither The stomach and intestines of this animal were found void of food the large intestine only contained fbecal mnatter For the sake of still fuirther assurance that the sugar found in the liver was neither due to some accidental cause nor immediately de rived from food we determined to deprive an animal of food for some days before examnining the liver The following experiment was accordingly performed Exp 6 A very large and powerful dog in admirable condition was subject to a rigid fast for seventytwo hoursthree full days Immediately after death by section of the medulla oblongata a por tion of the liver was sliced off and immersed in ice and salt Blood was then collected from the following sources 1st From the portal vein 2ndly From the liver i e blood which flowed from the liver when a portion of it was sliced off 3rdly From the right side of the heart 4thly From the aorta 5thly From the inferior velna cava Although these bloods were all treated in a similar mannier and tested with the same quantities of copper and soda yet none of them gave unequivocal evidence of the presence of sugar except that from the liver The blood from the right side of the heart gave doubtful evidence At first sight it may appear strange that the blood from the right side of the heart should contain scarcely an appreciable quantity of sugar while that of the liver showed its presence very obvi ously but this no doubt arose from the hepatic blood beinig in great part prevented from reaching the heart 1st on accouint of most of it escaping into the abdomen when the portion of liver was cut off and 2ndly on account of its flow being in great measure arrested by the ligature of the portal vessels All the bloods except the hepatic seemned to be free of glucogeni as well as sugar for none of them with that exception gave anly evidence of its presence after being treated with saliva in the usual way On examiniationi of the frozeni liver after three hours which as29o in the other cases was not allowed to thaw before being put into boiling water the decoction was found to reduce the copper readily On opening the stomach nothing was found in it except some neutral mucus The intestines were equally destitute of food and in the rectum only a very small quantity of feeces was found so there could be no doubt as to the animal being in a fasting con dition The only point now remaining was to determine quantitatively the increase in the amount of sugar in the liver after its removal from the body and for that purpose we preferred operating on aln animal fed on a mixed diet Exp 7 A small dog which had been previously fed on animal diet received a full meal of bread and milk Five hours afterwards the animal was pithed and a portion of the liver rapidly sliced off and immersed in a freezing mixture A ligature was placed on the portal vein and its blood collected before the circulation had ceased On examination this blood was founid to contain a small quantity of sugar derived no doubt from the food Bernard I believe has erred in supposilng that all the saccharine matter found in the animal organism is formed out of the glucogen produced in the liver This no doubt is the case in the carnivora when the diet is restricted to food inconvertible into sugar in the alimentary canal but cannot be regarded as the natural state of things either in the omnivora or herbivora for the food of the latter not only contains sugar but its amylaceous elements may be converted into that substance in the process of digestion The sugar found in the bodies of animals fed on a mixed diet ought therefore to be regarded partly as the direct product of the food and partly as derived from the glucogen formed in the liver Bernards chief argument against this view is founded on the fact that the livers of dogs fed on a mixed diet contain no more sugar than those fed on purely aninmal food In my opinion however this fact is not sufficient to decide the question for as the liver does not store up sugar the quantity it at any time contains is no criterion of the amount produced in it Moreover the sugar de rived from the food need not be expected to be found in the liver HIad Bernard gauged the sugar resent in the bloocl instead of that296 in the liver after each kind of diet the result obtained would I be lieve have led him to a different conclusion This being a point of great practical importance in the treatment of diabetes I may be here permitted to mention that I have occasionally found nearly twice as much sugar in the blood of an animal on a mixed than in that of one feeding on a purely flesh diet To return to the last experiment About two hours after the death of the animal portions of the frozen part of the liver and of that which had been kept warm in the body of the animal were carefully weighed and the proportions of sugar they respectively contained estimated by volumetric analysis The portion of frozen liver was found to contain 0333 per cent and that of the other 1 55 per cent of saccharine matter It is thus seeln that in two hours the sugar in the liver had augmented nearly fivefold As Bernard has shown the simple washing out of the liver by passing a stream of water through its vessels would remove all the sugar anteriorly formed On placilng it again aside for a short time a fresh portion of sugar would form in it at the expense of glucogen 0 333 per cent of sugar seems a small quantity but if we suppose a liver weighing as in man not less than 50 oz to contain 0 333 per cent above 70 grs of sugar would be present in it at the moment of deathno very insignificant quantity when it is recol lected that sugar is removed from the liver with every pulsation of the heart to be partly consumed and that it is as continually sup plied by the organ The results of the experiments now related do not therefore ill any way countenance the notion that sugar is not produced in the healthy animal body On the contrary such conclusions as they afford are altogether in favour of the generally received views upon the subject From the preceding experiments the following conclusions may be drawn 1st Sugar is a normal constituent of the blood of the general circulation 2ndly Portal blood of an animal on mixed diet contains sugar 3rdly Portal blood of a fasting animal as well as of ain animal fed solely on flesh is devoid of suLgar297 4thly The livers of dogs contain sugar whether the diet is animal or vegetable 5thly Under favourable circumstances saccharine matter may be found in the liver of an animal after three entire days of rigid fasting 6thly The sugar found in the bodies of animals fed on mixed food is partly derived directly from the food partly formed in the liver 7thly The livers of animals restricted to flesh diet possess the power of forming glueogen which glueogen is at least in part trans formed into sugar in the liver an inference which does not exclude the probability of glucogen like starch in the vegetable organism being transfolmed into other materials besides sugar 8thly As sugar is found in the liver at the moment of death its presence cannot properly be ascribed to a post mnortem change but is to be regarded as the result of a natural condition

CROSSSECTION PAPER AS A MATHEMATICAL INSTRUMENT ELIAKIM HASTINGS MOORE University of Chicago The following note is addressed to teachers and prospective teachers of mathematics in elementary and secondary schools and colleges who have come to recognize as fundamental the problem of closer correlation of arithmetic algebra and geometry with one another and with the various domains of application or the problem of unifi cation of elementary pure and applied mathematics Pure mathematics is as it were a language for the convenient expression and investiga tion of relations the most diverse in ordinary life and in nature The principles of the language are not arbitrary but are imposed by the phenomena demanding convenient expression The problem is solved when and only when we put our pupils into such a physical and intellectual environment that they learn to see and to think the mathematics for and of themselves In this note I wish to suggest possibilities which may have escaped attention in the systematic use of crosssection paper2 as a unifying Read in part March 5 19o6 before a joint meeting of the Junior Mathematical Club and the Mathematical Club of the University High School of the University of Chicago 2In the few diagrams to be given here only the squareruled paper appears I advise the use of the various styles of rulinginto squares into rectangles into parallelograms into triangles and with concentric circles and diverging radiiobtain able for instance from the Atlas School Supply Co Chicago The interaction of the various papers is

dialects of pure mathematicsnumber form formulaand to lead so directly to the concept of functionalitya concept which since the seventeenth cen tury has dominated advanced mathematics and the sciences a con cept which in the twentieth century according to the auspices will play a fundamental r61le in the reorganization of elementary mathe matical education Functionality is the relation or mathematical law of connection between two or more quantities or numbers subject to simultaneous and interdependent continuous variation like for instance the relation between the simultaneous ages of a father and his son or that between the length of the perimeter and the area of the surface of a square surrounded by a platoon of men preserving square formation and marching each directly away from a fixed flag pole or that between the simultaneous temperature pressure and density of a gas under conditions varying in time or in space Students will gain a more easy and perfect mastery of mathematics and their work will be full of richer direct and indirect value for them when the primary emphasis is laid on the recognition the depiction and the closer study of functional relations between variable quanti ties The variable quantity is the general quantity I recognize the difficulties inherent in the notions of general and signed quantities and numbers and in the notion of the depiction of a quantity of one kind to scale by a quantity of another kind But in elementary teaching these difficulties should be met not primarily by the analyti cal processes of logic resulting in the separation of mathematics into arithmetic algebra geometry only loosely related and not readily available for application They should be met by the systematic union of the three phases of mathematics in connection with problems The best modern textbooks on arithmetic show in a gratifying way that for the elementary school the problem of unification is under way to solution The authors develop in organic relation to problems of real life not only number work but also to a considerable degree literal arithmetic observational geometry geometrical drawing drawing to scale plotting and algebra Further it is known that gratifying progress is making in various quarters toward the solution of the problem for the secondary school Cf the columns of the School Review and of School Science and Mathematics Chicago and J W A Youngs book The Teaching of Mathematics to be published soon by Longmans Green  Co for information as to the current movements in this country and in England France and GermanyCROSSSECTION PAPER AS A MATHEMATICAL INSTRUMENT 319 of practical and scientific nature So approached these fundamental conceptions are not really so difficult Every boy loves trains and most boys have traveled With the crosssection paper in common place school use the boy of nine or ten will readily understand and create diagrams of train motion and will enjoy making the limited express overtake the slow freight at a certain time and place In this note confining attention to the simplest algebraic and geo metric aspects of functionality I study the crosssection paper in con nection with the questions of doubleentry tables and graphical compu tation and I hope to suggest in some measure the very central r6le which the crosssection paper as a mathematical instrument should be made to play in the unification of the elementary mathematical disciplines By maximizing the function of the crosssection paper we secure to speak only of pure mathematics intense reaction between geometry and algebra Geometry and algebra may certainly be developed independently each with its relations to arithmetic and no one doubts their high educational and scientific value as so developed But this value is indeed small compared with the value to be obtained by developing them together in continuous reaction thus releasing as it were abundant stores of subatomic energy The reader is requested to have at hand pencil straight edge and crosssection paper and to duplicate the constructions shown in the figures reserving for a second reading the more general parts of the text DOUBLEENTRY TABLESNUMERICAL AND GRAPHICAL I The fundamental operations of arithmetic and algebra involve two numbers and the results of addition etc should be exhibited in doubleentry tables as indicated below where for brevity the subtrac tion table is omitted and the given numbers X Y are taken as posi tive integers at most 5 These tables exhibiting the sum S etc xYs XYP yQ of the two numbers X Y are to be thought of as inscribed on square ruled paper each entry S or P or Q being made at the corresponding point  X Y of the paper Make such tables on large sheets with entries for X and Y varying for instance by fifths from  io to  10320 THE SCHOOL REVIEW and then see clearly how SX Y D YX PXY QYX or any function F of X and Y as a function of position of the point X Y varies in general continuously as the point X Y moves continuously 2 Evidently the numerical doubleentry tables I II III may conveniently be replaced by the graphical tables2 Figs I 2 3 5 4 3 2 I II Y 6 7 8 9

geographical topographical or meteorological We are merely to make mathe matical use of these conceptions Thus if the graphical addition table Fig i X  Y S is taken as the topographic map of a

done by cutting and pasting The question of topo graphic representation of a surface with respect to various parallel and nonparallel baseplanes should be raised and especially in the form of the derivation of one representation from another In this connection should be used the triangleruled paper its three axes diverging at 1200 from the chosen origin being taken to correspond to the three

curve made up of the points X Y whose coordinates correspond By the systematic use of the various kinds of crosssection paper for the construction and interpretation of graphical diagrams of data of

scale the corresponding number Y where Y denotes one of the various expressions in X X3 3X X4 x   xi 1IX and the situation changes immediately in significance and interest Use however the constructional methods of the squareruled paper for these methods are in fact exceedingly simple and powerful and of farreaching significance in theoretical and applied mathematics Depending on the simplest properties of similar triangles and rec tangles cf linkages A A B below properties evident after a little experience with the paper these constructional methods should be introduced in the grades in connection with drawing and observational geometry and held in focus throughout the highschool and college course Indeed for the purposes of elementary education our current deductive geometry is of the nature of a jetish to be abandoned in favor of a geometry built on a richer system of geometric axiomsa system built to recognize the crosssection paper with its wealth of intuitional relations In this wider environment there will be abundant need and opportunity for the systematic development of logical power The matter of the elimination of redundant axioms should be touched on only lightly in secondaryschool courses 6 The crosssection paper is at present used primarily for plotting that is for recording in graphical form tables of arithmetical data the result of arithmetical computations or of observations or of physi cal determinations The constructional methods are in effect methods of graphical computation and this constant checking of arithmetical and algebraic by geometric insight is the source of intense satisfac tion closely akin to that arising in the interaction between scientific theory and experimentation Arithmetical computations are so laborious that at present the graphical depiction of functional relations given by formula is of the324 THE SCHOOL REVIEW nature of a luxury and I suppose everyone knows how little real sig nificance attaches to the formula by itself On the other hand alert students and teachers will by various devices execute with ease the graphical computations2 of functional expressions 7 For instruments use merely a straight edge in connection with the two systems of parallel linear scales furnished by the grating of the squareruled paper interpolating if not by eye by use of paper strip or dividers But curves once graphically constructed are to be utilized as graphical tables thus a the standard hyperbola XY i Fig 2 is a table of reciprocals Y of numbers X and of reciprocals X of numbers Y b the standard parabola Y X2 Fig 5 is a table of squares Y of numbers X and of square roots X of numbers Y The graphical computation proceeds in scheme step by step par allel to the arithmetical computation If a computation is impossible arithmeticallye g the extraction of the square root of a negative zFor instance in Figs 4 and 5 are indicated two constructions involving a straight line OLM which appears in the various examples of each construction as OLIMz OL2M2 OL3M3 etc To effect these constructions expeditiously let the straight edge OLM of the ruler rest against a pin at 0 then in Fig 5 since UMOB as M runs one by one along the marks of the scale UQ from U the desired point L is marked on the consecutive vertical lines of the grating from the Yaxis while in Fig 4 as L runs one by one along the marks of the line YL 3 with the eye one notes M on UPo and transfers by the eye marking P on the vertical line through L Again curves once constructed can be cut out and used later as rulers for the duplication of such curves perhaps in different positions with respect to the axes The theory of such transformation of position of curves without change of form and more generally the theory of transformations with or without change of form and the cor responding theory of the transformation of the equations of the curves are of central importance Again if a curve is known to be symmetrical with respect to some straight line or point only onehalf of the curve needs to be constructed directly Discriminate between the various curves of the same figure by letters for the gen eral points of the respective curves as below in this paper and also graphically by use of dots and dashes shading and colors which should of course attach also to the elimination table and linkage diagram which as explained below serve to epitomize the construction 21 take the opportunity to refer to the article  Numerisches Rechnen by Mehmke in the Encyklopddie der mathematischen Wissenschaften Leipzig B G Teubner Vol I article F pp 941I081 for information as to the technical aspects of numerical computation whether arithmetical or by geometric drawing or by the use of graphical tables nomograms or by apparatus mechanical or physical The nomographic methods are rapidly becoming of central importance A nomogram once constructed for a certain type of problems of

unique as in the solution of equations the arithmetical process usually requires tedious approximations while the graphical process usually exhibits the results immediately in connection with the intersections of curves Of course a computation of either type may be carried through in various ways a comparison of these ways is interesting and instructive and in the fundamental cases especially useful as serving to assist in determining a desirable set of geometric axioms 8 In practice one handles addition directly by means of the linear scales of the paper Cf  i6 9 We propose the following problem in graphical multiplication Designating in general the coordinates X Y of a point K by XK YK to be read the X of K the Y of K having given a point P we seek a point L such that to scale XL XP  YL XpYp  problem of the type is solved by the mere drawing of straight lines and noting the intersections of the lines with one another and with the curves of the nomogram Thus to give a simple example a nomogram for the solution of the general quad ratic equation X 2 pXqo consists of the ordinary squareruled paper with the standard parabola Y X2 Fig 5 below The roots of any particular equation with given p q are the Xs of the points of section with the parabola of the straight line Y pX q This is the line crossing the X and Y axes in the respective points v o  o q  One computes q arithmetically or graphically  9 below Such an auxiliary computation is how ever unnecessary Thus dOcagnes nomogram loc cit 46 for the solution of U2pUqo consists merely of three curves p q U bearing three scales for p q U respec tively and the straight line joining the scale points p q cuts the U curve in scalepoints U the roots of the equation to be solved The three scales are in terms of the square ruled paper as follows the scale for p is the usual scale on the Yaxis the scale for q is the usual scale on the line X I the scale for U is   on the hyperbola xX2 Professor C S Slichter of the University of Wisconsin has arranged various styles of uniform and nonuniform ruling of crosssection paper to be had of dealers in Madison in such a way that all the elementary problems of logarithmic and trigo nometric computation are to be solved merely by the drawing of straight lines326 THE SCHOOL REVIEW This problem and naturally the corresponding problem in divi sion Given a point L to

OUB3L3M3P3 how precisely the agreement or rule of signs in the multiplication of two signed num bers fits this geometric situation o0 Geometric functionality comes to clearer vision by means of the notion of linkagethat is an arrangement of links or bars with slots and pins fixed or movable in slots and pivots and joints and braces such that however the linkage be moved certain essential properties of the diagram remain The linkage represents geometri cally the general variable diagram and algebraically a system of simultaneous equations between the simultaneous coordinates X Y of the various points of the diagram from which by elimination the relations sought are to be obtained In the linkage diagrams of this note points marked in black circles are fixed those marked in white circles are free to move over the whole plane those marked in two concentric circles are free to move each along a prescribed line or curve in the plane while straight lines shown may move but so as to remain straight and straight lines shown in the X and Ydirections may move but so as to retain those directionsCROSSSECTION PAPER AS A MATHEMATICAL INSTRUMENT 327 Thus the linkage diagram and the

entry MM XM  I specifies the curve M in this case a line on which M is to move There are no entries LL PP because the points L P are individually uncon ditioned and free to move over the whole

given graphi cally to scale as the coordinates X Y of a point P or L then a preliminary transformation of the data or a suitable modification of the process becomes necessary Such a transformation would be by means of the lines of the grating and the standard diagonal Y X OQ of Fig 5 below which throughout plays the r6le of a turner of Xsegments into equal Ysegments and vice versa For instance

point P corresponding to the algebraic relation P Y PXp  for instance YpXp between the coordinates Xp Y where PXY the P junction of the X of P denotes in general the algebraic expression in terms of zAs a result of the law of the motion of the point P its coordinates Xp Y will be always related in a certain way expressed algebraically by the fact that Yp always represents to scale a certain algebraic expression or function PXp in terms of the coordinate Xp as taken to scale We write for the curve P P  YPX  or as another expression of the same meaning P  XPP P These two equations are read the Y of P equals the P function of the X of P the X of P equals the inverse P function of the Y of P Every curve P determines in this way by the functional relations between the coordinates X Y of its variable point P a pair of mutually inverse functions PZ P Z  and conversely every pair of inverse functions is representable in this way by a curve drawn to scale with respect to a coordinate

their distribution in the first quadrant Those with k positive contain the origin o o those with k negative are asymptotic to both the coordinate axes These two classes k   k   are separated by the curves k o Y i k  o X I which partition the quadrant into four call them quarters the class k  lies in the SW and NE quarters to speak geographically as from the point i I  while the class k  lies in the SE and NW quarters of the quadrant The curves k  fall into two classes k    k     according as k is numeri cally greater than or less than i The turner k  I YX sub divides the class k  while the standard hyperbola k i YX1 subdivides the class k  There are thus eight octants of the first quadrant The curves k   occupy the SSW and NNE octants and come into the origin tangentially to the Xaxis the curves k    occupy the WSW and ENE octants and come into the origin tangentially to the Yaxis The area inclosed by the turner either coordinate axis and the hyperbola k  I is in fact infinite The curves k   occupy the WNW and ESE octants and inclose with the Yaxis a finite and with the Xaxis an infinite area The curves k   occupy the NNW and SSE octants and inclose with the Yaxis an infinite and with the Xaxis a finite area These statements concerning areas are capable of elementary proof The curves YA  X  YB XBh are cf I4 as to Y reciprocals each of the other since XA XB implies YA YB i

perceives or after a little practice will perceive how readily the linkages A and B alone or suitably combined serve to replace arithmetical by graphical computation of functional expres sionsand it is hoped that he will join with the writer in the following Concluding Agreements Today there is general agreement to cut out of arithmetic and algebra many complicated features of limited significance We make the same agreement as to geometry338 THE SCHOOL REVIEW In general we agree to develop arithmetical algebraic geometric technique in a physical and intellectual environment logically and psychologically rich full of movement force color full of connota tions and implications of and for real life of all kinds including most certainly the real life of mathematics and the sciences To secure for our young students a tolerable appreciation of the civilization of the twentieth century on the side of the theoretical and applied mathematical sciences as teachers of mathematics we agree to shape our instruction in mathematics from the beginning from a point of view no older and no lower than that of the wonder ful seventeenth century and to this end speaking theologically we propose to Canonize the CrossSection Paper

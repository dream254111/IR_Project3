CROSSSECTION PAPER AS A MATHEMATICAL INSTRUMENT ELIAKIM HASTINGS MOORE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO THE FOLLOWING NOTE IS ADDRESSED TO TEACHERS AND PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS OF MATHEMATICS IN ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES WHO HAVE COME TO RECOGNIZE AS FUNDAMENTAL THE PROBLEM OF CLOSER CORRELATION OF ARITHMETIC ALGEBRA AND GEOMETRY WITH ONE ANOTHER AND WITH THE VARIOUS DOMAINS OF APPLICATION OR THE PROBLEM OF UNIFI CATION OF ELEMENTARY PURE AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS PURE MATHEMATICS IS AS IT WERE A LANGUAGE FOR THE CONVENIENT EXPRESSION AND INVESTIGA TION OF RELATIONS THE MOST DIVERSE IN ORDINARY LIFE AND IN NATURE THE PRINCIPLES OF THE LANGUAGE ARE NOT ARBITRARY BUT ARE IMPOSED BY THE PHENOMENA DEMANDING CONVENIENT EXPRESSION THE PROBLEM IS SOLVED WHEN AND ONLY WHEN WE PUT OUR PUPILS INTO SUCH A PHYSICAL AND INTELLECTUAL ENVIRONMENT THAT THEY LEARN TO SEE AND TO THINK THE MATHEMATICS FOR AND OF THEMSELVES IN THIS NOTE I WISH TO SUGGEST POSSIBILITIES WHICH MAY HAVE ESCAPED ATTENTION IN THE SYSTEMATIC USE OF CROSSSECTION PAPER2 AS A UNIFYING READ IN PART MARCH 5 19O6 BEFORE A JOINT MEETING OF THE JUNIOR MATHEMATICAL CLUB AND THE MATHEMATICAL CLUB OF THE UNIVERSITY HIGH SCHOOL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO 2IN THE FEW DIAGRAMS TO BE GIVEN HERE ONLY THE SQUARERULED PAPER APPEARS I ADVISE THE USE OF THE VARIOUS STYLES OF RULINGINTO SQUARES INTO RECTANGLES INTO PARALLELOGRAMS INTO TRIANGLES AND WITH CONCENTRIC CIRCLES AND DIVERGING RADIIOBTAIN ABLE FOR INSTANCE FROM THE ATLAS SCHOOL SUPPLY CO CHICAGO THE INTERACTION OF THE VARIOUS PAPERS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT 3170 Q P4 0 H Z H H P4 W W P  F44 P4 0318 THE SCHOOL REVIEW ELEMENT IN MATHEMATICS I KNOW OF NO MEDIUM SERVING TO BRING TOGETHER SO CLOSELY AND SO EASILY THE THREE PHASES OR DIALECTS OF PURE MATHEMATICSNUMBER FORM FORMULAAND TO LEAD SO DIRECTLY TO THE CONCEPT OF FUNCTIONALITYA CONCEPT WHICH SINCE THE SEVENTEENTH CEN TURY HAS DOMINATED ADVANCED MATHEMATICS AND THE SCIENCES A CON CEPT WHICH IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY ACCORDING TO THE AUSPICES WILL PLAY A FUNDAMENTAL R61LE IN THE REORGANIZATION OF ELEMENTARY MATHE MATICAL EDUCATION FUNCTIONALITY IS THE RELATION OR MATHEMATICAL LAW OF CONNECTION BETWEEN TWO OR MORE QUANTITIES OR NUMBERS SUBJECT TO SIMULTANEOUS AND INTERDEPENDENT CONTINUOUS VARIATION LIKE FOR INSTANCE THE RELATION BETWEEN THE SIMULTANEOUS AGES OF A FATHER AND HIS SON OR THAT BETWEEN THE LENGTH OF THE PERIMETER AND THE AREA OF THE SURFACE OF A SQUARE SURROUNDED BY A PLATOON OF MEN PRESERVING SQUARE FORMATION AND MARCHING EACH DIRECTLY AWAY FROM A FIXED FLAG POLE OR THAT BETWEEN THE SIMULTANEOUS TEMPERATURE PRESSURE AND DENSITY OF A GAS UNDER CONDITIONS VARYING IN TIME OR IN SPACE STUDENTS WILL GAIN A MORE EASY AND PERFECT MASTERY OF MATHEMATICS AND THEIR WORK WILL BE FULL OF RICHER DIRECT AND INDIRECT VALUE FOR THEM WHEN THE PRIMARY EMPHASIS IS LAID ON THE RECOGNITION THE DEPICTION AND THE CLOSER STUDY OF FUNCTIONAL RELATIONS BETWEEN VARIABLE QUANTI TIES THE VARIABLE QUANTITY IS THE GENERAL QUANTITY I RECOGNIZE THE DIFFICULTIES INHERENT IN THE NOTIONS OF GENERAL AND SIGNED QUANTITIES AND NUMBERS AND IN THE NOTION OF THE DEPICTION OF A QUANTITY OF ONE KIND TO SCALE BY A QUANTITY OF ANOTHER KIND BUT IN ELEMENTARY TEACHING THESE DIFFICULTIES SHOULD BE MET NOT PRIMARILY BY THE ANALYTI CAL PROCESSES OF LOGIC RESULTING IN THE SEPARATION OF MATHEMATICS INTO ARITHMETIC ALGEBRA GEOMETRY ONLY LOOSELY RELATED AND NOT READILY AVAILABLE FOR APPLICATION THEY SHOULD BE MET BY THE SYSTEMATIC UNION OF THE THREE PHASES OF MATHEMATICS IN CONNECTION WITH PROBLEMS THE BEST MODERN TEXTBOOKS ON ARITHMETIC SHOW IN A GRATIFYING WAY THAT FOR THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL THE PROBLEM OF UNIFICATION IS UNDER WAY TO SOLUTION THE AUTHORS DEVELOP IN ORGANIC RELATION TO PROBLEMS OF REAL LIFE NOT ONLY NUMBER WORK BUT ALSO TO A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE LITERAL ARITHMETIC OBSERVATIONAL GEOMETRY GEOMETRICAL DRAWING DRAWING TO SCALE PLOTTING AND ALGEBRA FURTHER IT IS KNOWN THAT GRATIFYING PROGRESS IS MAKING IN VARIOUS QUARTERS TOWARD THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM FOR THE SECONDARY SCHOOL CF THE COLUMNS OF THE SCHOOL REVIEW AND OF SCHOOL SCIENCE

EXPRESS OVERTAKE THE SLOW FREIGHT AT A CERTAIN TIME AND PLACE IN THIS NOTE CONFINING ATTENTION TO THE SIMPLEST ALGEBRAIC AND GEO METRIC ASPECTS OF FUNCTIONALITY I STUDY THE CROSSSECTION PAPER IN CON NECTION WITH THE QUESTIONS OF DOUBLEENTRY TABLES AND GRAPHICAL COMPU TATION AND I HOPE TO SUGGEST IN SOME MEASURE THE VERY CENTRAL R6LE WHICH THE CROSSSECTION PAPER AS A MATHEMATICAL INSTRUMENT SHOULD BE MADE TO PLAY IN THE UNIFICATION OF THE ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICAL DISCIPLINES BY MAXIMIZING THE FUNCTION OF THE CROSSSECTION PAPER WE SECURE TO SPEAK ONLY OF PURE MATHEMATICS INTENSE REACTION BETWEEN GEOMETRY AND ALGEBRA GEOMETRY AND ALGEBRA MAY CERTAINLY BE DEVELOPED INDEPENDENTLY EACH WITH ITS RELATIONS TO ARITHMETIC AND NO ONE DOUBTS THEIR HIGH EDUCATIONAL AND SCIENTIFIC VALUE AS SO DEVELOPED BUT THIS VALUE IS INDEED SMALL COMPARED WITH THE VALUE TO BE OBTAINED BY DEVELOPING THEM TOGETHER IN CONTINUOUS REACTION THUS RELEASING AS IT WERE ABUNDANT STORES OF SUBATOMIC ENERGY THE READER IS REQUESTED TO HAVE AT HAND PENCIL STRAIGHT EDGE AND CROSSSECTION PAPER AND TO DUPLICATE THE CONSTRUCTIONS SHOWN IN THE FIGURES RESERVING FOR A SECOND READING THE MORE GENERAL PARTS OF THE TEXT

INTUITIONAL RELATIONS IN THIS WIDER ENVIRONMENT THERE WILL BE ABUNDANT NEED AND OPPORTUNITY FOR THE SYSTEMATIC DEVELOPMENT OF LOGICAL POWER THE MATTER OF THE ELIMINATION OF REDUNDANT AXIOMS SHOULD BE TOUCHED ON ONLY LIGHTLY IN SECONDARYSCHOOL COURSES 6 THE CROSSSECTION PAPER IS AT PRESENT USED PRIMARILY FOR PLOTTING THAT IS FOR RECORDING IN GRAPHICAL FORM TABLES OF ARITHMETICAL DATA THE RESULT OF ARITHMETICAL COMPUTATIONS OR OF OBSERVATIONS OR OF PHYSI CAL DETERMINATIONS THE CONSTRUCTIONAL METHODS ARE IN EFFECT METHODS OF GRAPHICAL COMPUTATION AND THIS CONSTANT CHECKING OF ARITHMETICAL AND ALGEBRAIC BY GEOMETRIC INSIGHT IS THE SOURCE OF INTENSE SATISFAC TION CLOSELY AKIN TO THAT ARISING IN THE INTERACTION BETWEEN SCIENTIFIC THEORY AND EXPERIMENTATION ARITHMETICAL COMPUTATIONS ARE SO LABORIOUS THAT AT PRESENT THE GRAPHICAL DEPICTION OF FUNCTIONAL RELATIONS GIVEN BY FORMULA IS OF THE324 THE SCHOOL REVIEW NATURE OF A LUXURY AND I SUPPOSE EVERYONE KNOWS HOW LITTLE REAL SIG NIFICANCE

LOGICALLY AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY RICH FULL OF MOVEMENT FORCE COLOR FULL OF CONNOTA TIONS AND IMPLICATIONS OF AND FOR REAL LIFE OF ALL KINDS INCLUDING MOST CERTAINLY THE REAL LIFE OF MATHEMATICS AND THE SCIENCES TO SECURE FOR OUR YOUNG STUDENTS A TOLERABLE APPRECIATION OF THE CIVILIZATION OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY ON THE SIDE OF THE THEORETICAL AND APPLIED MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES AS TEACHERS OF MATHEMATICS WE AGREE TO SHAPE OUR INSTRUCTION IN MATHEMATICS FROM THE BEGINNING FROM A POINT OF VIEW NO OLDER AND NO LOWER THAN THAT OF THE WONDER FUL SEVENTEENTH CENTURY AND TO THIS END SPEAKING THEOLOGICALLY WE PROPOSE TO CANONIZE THE CROSSSECTION PAPER

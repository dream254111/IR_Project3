of Exchange By EDMUND PLATT ViceGovernor Federal Reserve Board THE topic America and the Debts of Europe is broad enough to allow of considerable latitude and does not necessarily imply that dis cussion is to be limited to the debts of Europe to America but I take it that it is with such debts that we are chiefly concerned and I propose to treat particularly not of the debts of European governments to our govern ment or even to our people who have purchased the bonds of European governments but of the debts which business men manufacturers and bankers of Europe owe to our business men manufacturers and bankers With regard to the great debt of our former allies or associates in the War to our government I merely want to say in passing that I have been rather surprised as to the source from which the principal demand for its early payment appears to come If this demand came from the great financial centres or from men of large incomes who pay the most burdensome taxes it could be ex plained by the desire for relief from taxes through the application of the sums received to the reduction of the war debt but it appears to come from producing centres and particularly from agricultural sections which are dependent upon export demand for their products for maintenance of prices It would seem clear that pay ment of any part of this debt with conditions not even approaching normal in Europe must seriously decrease the purchasing power of the people of the allied countries and must therefore make for lower prices for the products we sell to them It is of course well known that European merchants traders and bankers owe large sums of money to Americans Even if we had no direct proof of this we should know that it must be true from the fact that large flotations of foreign securities have been made in this country without turning the tide of gold importations Since last October the foreign financing in this country has at times almost equalled the current trade credit balance but gold importations have continued with only a slight slacken ing due evidently to the stoppage of gold production in the South African mines through strikes AMOUNT OF UNFUNDED TRADE BALANCE How much of an unfunded trade balance is there This has proved an interesting study for economists and statisticians who have assembled many columns of interesting figures but have differed considerably in their conclusions I think the first serious effort to bring together the known facts the visible items with some estimate of the invisible items was made by the Division of Analysis and Research of the Federal Reserve Board in the Federal Reserve Bulletin for Sep tember 1920 A merchandise balance had accumulated in our favor of 6062000000 between November 1 1918 and July 31 1920 and it had become very evident long before that such a onesided trade could not be 80TRADE BALANCE AND STABILIZATION OF EXCHANGE carried on indefinitely The Federal Reserve Bulletin brought to light off sets that appeared to reduce this bal ance of more than six billion dollars to about three billion dollars adding that from this of course must be deducted the amount of indebtedness to European and other countries which existed at about the time of the Armistice This was followed the next month by a much more elaborate study by Dr B M Anderson in the Chase Economic Bulletin on Europes un funded debt His conclusion was that on September 15 1920 Europe owed an unfunded debt of over 3500000000 to private individuals banks and corporations in the United States this being in addition to the ten billion dollars which European governments owed to the United States government and in addition to the debt of Europe to investors in the United States holding European secur ities Dr Anderson maintained that the primary explanation of the tre mendous expansion of bank credit in the United States in 191920 was our unbalanced and unfinanced ex port trade together with the rising prices fictitious prosperity and specu lation which have grown out of the unbalanced export trade Our ex porters had borrowed money from our banks in large amount because of inability to collect what was due them abroad or because they had taken payments in foreign currency balances which they thought they could later convert into American dollars at more favorable rates of exchange Dr Anderson declared that computations as to the unfunded balances owed us on our worldtrade were not particularly valuable that the European balance was the only one that counted for the triangular exchange of goods and of credit by which Americas credit bal 7 ances in Europe had been settled through debit balances with South America and the Orient had broken down This idea was combatted by Pro fessor John H Williams in the June 1921 Review of Economic Statistics of the Harvard University Committee on Economic Research He gave reasons for believing that it is still permissible to subtract from Europes debt to us the amounts we owe to nonEuropean countries and his final conclusion was that the unfunded debt to American merchants bankers and corporations was considerably smaller than others had estimated Our international situation since the Armistice he declared has been less alarming than has frequently been stated It appears improbable that our unfunded balance exceeded a billion dollars at the end of last year December 31 1920 Our unfunded balance from Europe was estimated at from half a billion to a billion greater than our balance with the world as a whole but he concluded It is not possible to believe that so prolonged and pronounced a recovery could have occurred in European exchanges had London and the Con tinent been indebted to the United Statesbesides the 10844000000 of obligations held by our government and the private longterm indebtedness by some three to four billion dollars In November 1921 the Federal Reserve Bulletin returned to the sub ject with a much more complete statement of items of credit and debit than in the study of September 1920 the conclusion was that so far as visible items and items which could be estimated with some approach to accuracy were concerned the sum due our merchants bankers and cor porations was on October 1 1921 no less than 3408000000 The Bulletin mentioned offsets that might reduce 81THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY this amount such as the speculative purchases of foreign currencies by Americans but did not attempt to estimate their amount This sum referred to our trade with non European as well as with European countries It was swelled half a billion dollars by the inclusion of an item with relation to the cost of cancellation of European war contracts in this country in 1919 an item not included I think in any previously published estimate The February 1922 Federal Reserve Bulletin pointed out that in October November and December our favor able balance of trade was a little less than 300000000 from which gold im ports of 125000000 were to be sub tracted leaving the net addition to the unfunded balance 175000000 and conjecturing that the invisible items plus foreign financing probably more than offset that amount The un funded balance on January 1 1922 was therefore given as 3400000000 lopping off 8000000 from the No vember estimate There have of course been other contributions on this subject The Journal of Commerce on Monday April 24 1922 published a number of articles by leading bankers and econ omists and the economic magazines have published occasional papers but generally speaking these have added only an item or two to the studies already referred to or have expressed opinions without bringing much that was new to their support UPS AND DOWNS OF EXCHANGE It is noteworthy that the main studies of this subject coincided with periods of depression or of recovery in sterling exchange Sterling had been pegged during the war at 476 and when allowed to take its own course after March 18 1919 began to fall until in February 1920 it reached a low point of 318 It recovered to 400 then fell to 358 in August at the time when the first study of unfunded balances was made in the Federal Reserve Bulletin in September of that year followed by Dr Andersons study of October In the spring of 1921 there was a remarkable recovery with cable rates at or a little above 4 for more than a week in the latter part of May and it was during this period of recovery or before the re action from it had proceeded very far that Professor Williams made his elaborate contribution to the Harvard Review of Economic Statistics It was natural at that time to find reasons for believing the unfunded balance much less than had previously been esti mated and Professor Williamss con clusion that so pronounced a recovery could not have occurred with so great an unfunded balance as three or four billions of dollars seems justified By the time of its publication in June however the reaction was well under way and before the end of July sterling rates were as low as in August of the year before below 360 from July 19 to August 6 When the Division of Analysis and Research of the Federal Reserve Board made its second and chief investigation of the question of unfunded debts for the November issue of the Bulletin there had been considerable recovery but the study was published or was prepared just before the notable rise in sterling in French francs and in lire that began about the time the Conference on the Limitation of Armaments met in Washington By the end of November British pounds had risen to about 4 and by Decem ber 31 to 4921 and by March to 440 Since March the advance has pro ceeded less rapidly but has been wellTRADE BALANCE AND STABILIZATION OF EXCHANGE sustained There is no further talk of debasing the pound and British bankers express confidently their ex pectation that par may be reached before the close of the present year or soon after the end of the year With the exception of one or two items there is no necessary conflict between the figures on the unfunded balance as given in the November Federal Reserve Bulletin and carried forward to the end of the year and other studies of the subject for the reason that the Bulletin has not attempted anything further than an appraisal of known facts with such invisible items as had long been esti mated as offsetting the balance of trade such as tourists expenditures relief contributions emigrants re mittances etc concerning which enough information could be obtained upon which to base estimates As already stated it appears that the gold imports the known investments of Americans in foreign securities and the invisible items included in the Bulletins figures have somewhat over balanced the excess of exports over imports for several months but for more than a year imports have been slowly increasing while exports in value at least have been decreasing so that this change alone is not enough to account for the very pronounced and wellsustained rise in sterling and in the principal allied currencies The conclusion seems inevitable that no such recovery could have been made if there were still an unfunded balance due the merchants and bankers of this country as great as three billion dollars That there was such a balance in the summer of 1920 when the Federal Reserve Board first undertook an investigation of the subject I have no doubt Liquidation had scarcely begun at that time and Dr Anderson was doubtless also right in attributing a large share of the overextended condition of banks in the financial centres to the efforts of our exporters to carry this balance Whether it could have been cut down so much as Professor Williams estimated by the beginning of the year 1921 seems more than doubtful but that liquidation and invisible offsets had by that time become well started is reasonably certain The Federal Reserve Bulletin has suggested that speculative pur chases of foreign currencies may have been a large item and has also sug gested that American exporters have doubtless charged off considerable losses It seems probable that the major depressions of exchange mark periods when our people were seeking to convert foreign balances into dollars and that exchange recovered when most of the conversions had been made and losses wiped out Some very large American exporters are known to have taken considerable losses in this way They sold in terms of foreign currencies and found them when payments became due con siderably depressed but when re covery was delayed beyond their expectations they finally bought dol lars and took their losses Very large losses are also known to have been charged off by some of our bankers It should be remembered always that even if the balance of trade were actually against us European ex changes would not be at their old gold pars The principles laid down in the wellknown Bullion Report of 1810 with regard to the effect of irredeem able paper currency on exchange still govern With the English budget in balance and British prices about as low as ours sterling might be nearer the old par than it is now if there were no unfunded balance due us but it cannot go to par until the paper 83THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY currency of England is actually and freely exchangeable for gold RESTORATION OF THE EXCHANGES Predictions as to the future course of exchange are rather hazardous however As already mentioned there were British economists and bankers who declared no longer ago than last fall that the pound sterling could never recover or that its recovery could not be attained without a ruinous decrease of prices and that it would be better to stabilize it at about 365 or 370 There has in fact been a considerable decline in prices in Great Britain and that decline has been doubtless a lead ing factor in the recovery of sterling and also in the recovery of Britains export trade No longer ago than April 1 the editor of the Economic World whose articles are always worth reading and usually sound predicted that no person now living will ever see the value of the present French franc of actual currency normally and regu larly equal to onehalf of that of the gold franc established by law as the monetary unit of France At the time that was published the French franc was quoted at about 9 cents in our currency It had been as low as 579 in 1921 but had recovered to 813 at the end of December Within a little more than two weeks after Mr Marsh made this prediction French francs sold at 9371 and had little more than a quarter of a cent to go to reach half par They have since fallen back but I see no reason why they should not again continue to advance if France makes progress towards bal ancing her budget They are not lower now than our Civil War green backs were at one time and complete restoration does not appear impossible though it may take a considerable number of years I am not going to undertake to estimate just how great an unfunded balance may still be due to the mer chants bankers and corporations of America They had a severe lesson in 1920 and have since then preferred a diminishing business for which pay ment was reasonably sure in dollars It appears also clear that they have for many months been collecting or funding in some way or charging off debts due them I believe that investments in real estate in Europe and in the shares of European enter prises have been a very large offsetting factor Professor Williams states in the May number of the Quarterly Journal of Economics that foreign investments in Germany since the Armistice have been estimated at nearly 250000 000 and it is well known that Ameri cans have been large investors not only in German property but in Poland in Italy and in the states which formerly made up the Austrian empire This item of foreign investment with the widespread speculative purchases of foreign currencies might easily have amounted to a billion dollars CONFIDENCE TO PRECEDE CREDIT The debts of individuals in Europe to individuals and corporations in America at any rate cannot at present I believe be so large as to present any insuperable bar either to the restoration of the exchanges that seem within reach of restoration or to the stabilization of exchange with countries where inflation of paper currencies has reached a point beyond the possibility of restoration Fluctua tion of exchange due to inflation is annoying and introduces a very un desirable element of speculation into foreign trade An irredeemable paper currency even if not constantly ex panded is subject to changes of value from political and other causes not 84AMERICA AND THE DEBTS OF EUROPE related to trade balances or inter national debts Our Civil War green backs went up or down in value in ac cordance with the fortunes of the Union armies and later with relation to policies under discussion in Congress The depreciation of some European currencies has undoubtedly been in creased by the instability of some governments or by socialistic policies Confidence as Secretary Hughes has well said must precede credit Given good government and balanced budgets something could doubtless be done in the direction of stabilizing exchanges between countries having an irredeem able paper currency and countries on a gold basis It would probably be in the nature of recognition for fixed periods or in some cases permanently of new pars around which fluctuations could be controlled within something approaching normal limits No outside or international attempts at stabilization however could per form miracles or take the place of the necessary internal conditions and efforts in each country Stabilization of exchanges between the United States and the neutral countries whose cur rencies are not greatly depreciated such as Holland and the Scandinavian countries seems within reach on the former gold par bases and foreign trade would doubtless be benefited by such control of fluctuation as might be in stituted in other cases but so long as our own currency is sound and our prices attractive and so long as the pound sterling continues to maintain itself at a point so near par with francs and lire showing progress it can hardly be said that the continuance or recovery of our foreign trade are really dependent upon any such stabil izing measures America and the Debts of Europe BY JOHN F SINCLAIR President John F Sinclair Company Minneapolis Minnesota IN the tragic years from 1914 to 1921 inclusive four great changes oc cured in American finance as follows 1 American exports exceeded im ports by more than twenty billions of dollars 2 Forty per cent of the gold coin of the world lodged itself in Americas strong box 3 America changed from a great debtor to the greatest of creditor nations 4 America broke her centuryold tradition of national isolation sent two millions of men three thousand miles across the sea and spent fifty billions of dollars doing it Now in addition to between three and four billions of dollars owing to corporations and individuals in Amer ica eighteen countries of Europe owe to the Treasury of the United States the stupendous sum of more than eleven billions of dollarseleven thou sand millions The countries owing andthe amounts as of April 1 1922 are given in the table on page 86 These amounts are so large so vast and so difficult to grasp that they cal not possibly mean anything concrete to any of us except perhaps by way of contrast or comparison For this vast sum a high school costing one million dollars could be built in every one of the three thou 85

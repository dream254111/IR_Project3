STATE REPORTER 20 MAY1899 SUPERVISORS MONTGOMERY COUNTY V TALLANT LEVY TAXES UPON SUCH PROPERTY AS IS ASSESSED WITH STATE TAXES WITHIN THE COUNTY THAT THEY CANNOT LOOK BEYOND THE SUBJECTS OF TAXATION PROVIDED BY THE LEGISLATURE AS IT IS THE PROVINCE OF THAT BODY ALONE TO PROVIDE WHEN HOW AND FOR WHAT PURPOSES A TAX SHALL BE LAID AND TO PROVIDE THE SUBJECTS OF TAXATION THE REAL QUESTION THEN TO BE DETERMINED IS DOES THE STATE ASSESS WITH TAXES THE CAPITAL EMPLOYED BY A MERCHANT IN HIS BUSINESS THE ACT PROVIDING FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF TAXESACTS 188990 P 197 SEC 27SAYS EVERY MERCHANT SHALL PAY A LICENSE TAX FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF TRANSACTING BUSINESS IN THIS STATE TO BE GRADUATED BY THE AMOUNT OF PUR CHASES MADE BY HIM DURING THE PERIOD FOR WHICH HIS LICENSE IS GRANTED SECTION 28 SAYS FOR EVERY LICENSE TO A MERCHANT OR MERCANTILE FIRM THE AMOUNT TO BE PAID SHALL BE GRADUATED AS FOLLOWS     AND THEN PROVIDES THAT THE SUM IMPOSED UNDER AND BY VIRTUE OF THIS SECTION SHALL BE IN LIEU OF ALL TAXES FOR STATE PURPOSES ON THE CAPITAL ACTUALLY EMPLOYED BY SAID MERCHANT OR MERCANTILE FIRM IN SAID BUSINESS AND FURTHER PROVIDES THAT THE SUMS REQUIRED BY THIS SECTION TO BE PAID WHEN THE LICENSE IS TAKEN OUT SHALL BE COLLECTED IN THE SAME MANNER THAT THE AMOUNTS REQUIRED TO BE PAID FOR OTHER LICENSES ARE COLLECTED IT SEEMS PERFECTLY CLEAR FROM THE LANGUAGE QUOTED THAT THE LEGISLA TURE HAS NOT ONLY FAILED TO DECLARE THAT THE CAPITAL EMPLOYED BY MER CHANTS IN THEIR BUSINESS SHALL BE ASSESSED FOR TAXATION BUT HAS EXPRESSLY SAID THAT IT SHALL NOT BE SO ASSESSED BY DECLARING THAT THE LICENSE RE QUIRED  SHALL BE IN LIEU ON ALL TAXES FOR STATE PURPOSES ON THE CAPITAL ACTUALLY EMPLOYED BY SAID MERCHANT OR MERCANTILE FIRM IN SAID BUSI NESS AND TO FURTHER MAKE PLAIN THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT THE SAME SECTION PROVIDES WHAT THE WORD CAPITAL SHALL INCLUDE AND SAYS ALL OTHER PROPERTY HELD BY SUCH MERCHANT OR FIRM SHALL BE LISTED AND TAXED AS OTHER PROPERTY AGAIN EXCLUDING THE IDEA THAT THE CAPITAL EMPLOYED BY THE MERCHANT SHOULD BE ASSESSED FOR TAXATION PRIOR TO 1874 THE CAPITAL EMPLOYED BY MERCHANTS IN THEIR BUSINESS WAS ASSESSED FOR TAXATION BUT IN THAT YEAR AN ACT WAS PASSED CONTAIA ING THE SAME PROVISIONS FOUND IN THE PRESENT ACT PROVIDING FOR A LICENSE INSTEAD OF AN ASSESSMENT OF THE CAPITAL FOR TAXATION THIS ACT WAS AS SAILED BY THE MERCHANTS AS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND THE QUESTION WAS BROUGHT TO THIS COURT WHERE THE LAW WAS SUSTAINED UPON THE GROUND THAT IT WAS A LICENSE TAX UPON THE BUSINESS OF THE MERCHANT AND THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAD THE POWER TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE BUSINESS OF THE MERCHANT COULD BE REACHED BY THE AD VOLOREM SYSTEM OR NOT AND TO ADOPT THE POLICY OF REQUIRING A LICENSE IN ITS STEAD COMMONWEALTH V 21VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER MOORE 25 GRATT 959 THIS BEING SO THE LANGUAGE  THE SUMS IMPOSED UNDER AND BY VIRTUE OF THIS SECTION SHALL BE IN LIEU OF ALL TAXES FOR STATE PURPOSES ON THE CAPITAL ACTUALLY EMPLOYED ETC CLEARLY RELIEVES THE CAPITAL SO EMPLOYED FROM THE BURDEN OF ANY TAX FOR STATE PURPOSES AND HAVING EXPRESSLY WITHHELD SAID CAPITAL FROM TAXATION FOR STATE PUR POSES IT CANNOT BE ASSESSED BY THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND MADE LIABLE TO LEVY FOR COUNTY PURPOSES CODE SEC 833 CLAUSE 2 THE APPELLANT INSISTS THAT UNDER SECTION 8 CLAUSE 4 OF THE ACT IT WAS THE DUTY OF THE COMMISSIONER TO ASSESS THE CAPITAL OF APPELLEE EM PLOYED IN HIS MERCANTILE BUSINESS FOR TAXATION THAT CLAUSE PROVIDES AS FOLLOWS HE THE COMMISSIONER SHALL ASCERTAIN FROM EACH PERSON IN HIS DISTRICT CITY OR TOWN THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL INVESTED USED OR EM PLOYED IN ANY TRADE OR BUSINESS NOT OTHERWISE TAXED THIS CLAUSE STANDING BY ITSELF WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE CONSTRUCTION CONTENDED FOR BUT WHEN IT IS READ IN CONNECTION WITH THE OTHER PROVIS IONS OF THE LAW ALREADY QUOTED IT WAS CLEARLY NOT THE DUTY OF THE COM MISSIONER TO ASSESS THE CAPITAL OF THE APPELLEE FOR TAXATION CERTAINLY NOT FOR STATE PURPOSES AND CONSEQUENTLY NOT FOR COUNTY PURPOSES IF THERE WERE DOUBT AS TO THE CORRECTNESS OF THIS CONCLUSION THE RESULT WOULD BE THE SAME FOR IT IS WELL SETTLED THAT STATUTES LEVYING DUTIES OR TAXES UPON CITIZENS ARE TO BE CONSTRUED MOST STRONGLY AGAINST THE GOV ERNMENT AND IN FAVOR OF THE CITIZEN AND THESE PROVISIONS ARE NOT TO BE EXTENDED BY IMPLICATION BEYOND THE CLEAR IMPORT OF THE LANGUAGE USED REVENUE LAWS ARE NEITHER REMEDIAL STATUTES NOR LAWS FOUNDED UPON ANY PERMANENT PUBLIC POLICY AND ARE NOT THEREFORE TO BE LIBERALLY CONSTRUED HENCE WHENEVER THERE IS A JUST DOUBT THAT DOUBT SHOULD ABSOLVE THE TAX PAYER FROM HIS BURDEN PLANER CO V FLOURNOY 88 VA 1029 AND AUTHORITIES THERE CITED APPELLANT INVOKES ARTICLE 10 SEC 1 OF THE STATE CONSTITUTION WHICH DECLARES THAT TAXES SHALL BE EQUAL AND UNIFORM AND THAT ALL PROPERTY BOTH REAL AND PERSONAL SHALL BE TAXED AND INSISTS THAT THE LEG ISLATURE HAS NO POWER TO EXEMPT THE CAPITAL IN QUESTION FROM TAXATION OR TO DEPRIVE THE COUNTY OF ITS RIGHT TO ASSESS THE SAME IF THIS WERE CONCEDED IT COULD NOT HELP THE COUNTY OF MONTGOMERY FOR IF ALL PROP ERTY MUST BE TAXED AS WELL BY THE COUNTY AS BY THE STATE IT CAN ONLY BE DONE IN THE MODE PRESCRIBED BY LAW AND THE CONSTITUTION MAKES IT THE DUTY OF THE LEGISLATURE TO PASS SUCH LAWS AS ARE NECESSARY TO CARRY ITS PROVISIONS RELATING TO TAXATION INTO EFFECT VA  TENN R CO V WASHINGTON COUNTY 30 GRATT 471 THE LEGISLATURE HAS MADE NO PROVISION

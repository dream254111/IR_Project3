j100195,The Jewish Quarterly Review,1449944,The Jessurun Family,i263119,Notes and Discussion NOTES AND DISCUSSION The Jessurun FamilyHad Dr Kaufmann consulted the Bibliotheca AnqloJudaica he would have added at least one AngloJewish name to the catalogue of Jessuruns he gives in the last number of the Quarterly At pp 5961 of that work a list of Jewish merchants is transcribed from the London Directory of 1677 The very first names in that list are Isaac Alvarez of St Mary Axe and Jacob Jessurun Alvarez of  St Mary Ax near Berry Street At first sight it would seem that these are the very persons for whom Dr Kaufmann is seeking but this is not the case The Jacob Jessurun Alvarez was only the grandfather and namesake of the Jacob ben Isaac Jessurun Alvarez of London whose epitaph Dr Kaufmann has discovered in Vienna and the Isaac Alvarez was no relation of the Jessurunsat least no near relation He was a wealthy jeweller a Marrano by birth and I gather from his will Prob Off Hare fol 11 proved 1684 that he was related to Daniel Cohen Henriques alias Duarte Henriques Alvarez who was a contem porary of Carvajal see my Resettlement p 6 and who is mentioned in the list of early Jewish settlers preserved among the MSS of Emanuel Mendes da Costa and printed by Picciotto Sketches of Anglo Jewish History p 32 cf Bib AngloJud pp xxi xxii His full name as given in the Bevis Marks Synagogue records was Isaac Alvarez or Israel Nunez As Dr Kaufmann seems to be interested in Jewish epitaphs he may like to have the very singular one inscribed to the memory of Isaac Alvarez in the Beth Holim Cemetery Carrera 2 No 8 the text of which has been preserved by Lysons Environs of London III p 477 It runs as follows Under this marble all thats left behind Of Isaac Alvarez Nunez lies confined Of Hebrew race by birth a Portugall In London his abode and funerall Whose fargained knowledge in mysterious gems Sparkled in the European diadems A loving husband a tender parent a true friend Sincere in all his dealings to the end  And this to give his name continud life The monument of a most loving wife Before I touch more directly on the subject of this note I should like to say a word or two on the name Jessurun From Dr Kaufmanns re ference to  the famous Jessurun family I gather that he is of opinion that all the persons of that name belonged to one family In this I cannot agree with him I have frequently found Marrano families in no way related adopting the name Jessurun as soon as they were in a position to return openly to Judaism sometimes in substitution for their secular names and sometimes in addition to them It was doubtless derived in a penitent spirit from Deut xxxii 1543 which is strikingly applicable to the sin of Marranism One can imagine how the reference v 25 to the sword without and terror within  would appeal to the imagination of fugitives from the Inquisition The family of Salvador 439440 The Jewish Quarterly Review Rodrigues afterwards known as Jessurun Rodrigues in the Synagogue and as Salvador outside were probably guided in their choice of a Hebrew name by the fact that Jessurun  lightly esteemed the rock of his salvation v 15 I have been very much struck by the number of families bearing homonymous names like De Pinna De la Penha Pinel Pimentel etc who have adopted the Hebrew name Jessurun eg Paul de Pina  Rehuel Jessurun Filipe Pimentel  Im manuel Jessurun de Crasto Perhaps this is only a coincidence The family of Jessurun Alvarez is principally of interest as a con nection of the great family of Mendes da Costa The Salvadors or Jessurun Rodrigues were also related to this famous house and it is possible that both were descended from the same stock as the poet Paul de Pinna seeing that among their relatives the name Rodrigues Pinel occurs more than once In the MIS records of the MIendes da Costas which I have collected both these branches of the Jessuruns are mentioned at a very early date In 1622 a ship of the East India Com pany captured a Portuguese vessel at Mozambique and among the prisoners were Antonio de Mendes Salvador de Regus sic Dominicus de Costa and Francisco de Mesquita all merchants of Lisbon Cat State Papers Colonial East Indies 162529 If we read for Salvador de RegusSalvador Rodrigues ie Jessurun Rodriques these names agree with the first line of my pedigree of the Mendes da Costas which falls about the same date That is to say that they are all to be found as cousins and brothersinlaw in the contemporary generation of the Mendes da Costas and I have little doubt that they are the same persons Curiously enough the earliest reference I have to a Jessurun Alvarez is also in connection with India Among the miscellaneous memoranda of the late Emanuel Mendes da Costa are several transcripts from the ledger or Livro Grande now unfortunately lost of Fernao Mendes and Alvaro da Costa who conducted an immense banking busi ness in England Holland France Italy Portugal Brazil and the East Indies in the seventeenth century Among these excerpts is one relating to Jacob Jessurun Alvarezthe same mentioned in the London Direc tory of 1677who is stated to have visited John Mendes da Costa at Calcutta in 1679 This Jacob Jessurun Alvarez was a prominent member of the Bevis Marks congregation In 1720 he cooperated with Joseph Musaphia Elias Lindo Joseph Henriques Solomon Pereira Jacob Jessurun Rodrigues Aaron Lamego and Abraham Franco to found the Dowry Society known as pl Y 52 He died in 1723 his son Isaac having predeceased him in 1711 His grandson Jacob who settled in Vienna and died there married Ester Lopes Pereira sister of the Viennese financier Diego Baron dAguilar This will account for his residence in the Austrian capital His son Isaac married Baron dAguilars daughter Sarah Jacob had a sister Sarah who married Jacob Mendes da Costa in 1717 Some idea of the social position of the family may be derived from the factattested by Jacob Mendes da Costas willthat Sarah Alvarez received 8500 as a marriage por tion and that the settlements amounted to nearly 13000 The present Mendes da Costas and a branch of the Mocattas are descended from Sarah Alvarez One of her brothers Moses Alvarez came on evil days and his daughters received marriage portions from the Society which their greatgrandfather had helped to found One of them married Benjamin Nunez Lara then bookkeeper to the wealthy and philan thropic Benjamin Mendes da Costa who presented the Portuguese con gregation with the freehold of their Synagogue in Bevis Marks It was his son Moses Lara who prospering in life and marrying theNotes and Discussion 441 grandniece of his fathers employer bequeathed the Lara Fund amounting to about 40000 to the Synagogue Benjamin Laras brother Aaron married Rachel DIsraeli halfsister of Isaac DIsraeli and aunt to Lord Beaconsfield I hope I have said enough to explain who was the mysterious English Jew whose epitaph Dr Kaufmann has discovered in Vienna At least I have shown that he belonged to one of the leading AngloJewish families of his day A full account of the Jessuruns will appear in my Genealogical History of the House of Mendes da Costa and allied Families which will form an early instalment of the work on Anglo Jewish Flamily History on which I have been so long engaged LUCIEN WOLF JehudahaLevi on the Dogmas of Judaism  In the brilliant and original seventeenth section of the third book of his Kuzari in which the Rabbi for the Chaber is nothing more nor less than a Rabbi explains the deep meaning of the Jewish prayers to the king Jehuda haLevi enumerates the dogmas of Judaism according to his own reckon ing The passage in question is a most important one although as is usual with him we find it thrown into the form of a casual observation It has remained hitherto unnoticed because Jehudas translator Judah ibnTibbon has as it were lost it among other materials The poetphilosopher treats of that impressive passage in the daily morning prayer where the magnificent expression of our belief in the unity of God the  Shema Israel is preceded and followed by bene dictions which appear like antechambers leading to the inner sanctuary of monotheism to the great watchword of the YVW These two bles sings nlnllil l1l and m1r 1Mrl mark the one the casting off of every trace of idolatry the other the perpetual remembrance of Gods election of the people of Israel Here every heathen tendency to deify natural phenomena and natural objects is for ever disavowed Worm and sun before the Supreme Being of equal value and dignity are alike cited as witnesses of Gods creative power so that mans admiration of the heavenly bodies is checked by reference to the great First Cause of all Here the believer is made aware of the greatest wonder of the system of the universethe fact that man has been found worthy to receive the revelation of the highest truth to be as it were the mirror of these spiritual luminaries of heaven upon earth which reveal the Deity to mortal eyes Passing thus rapidly through nature and history we reach the passage in the ritual in which the unity of God is pro claimed in the old sacred form of the Shema Next we read the extract from the Scriptures which pledges us to accept and obey the divine law With the proud and joyful consciousness of the wellspring from which our doctrine flows we next eagerly proclaim the declaration S1 nMN which ends with the solemn pledge that the law which the fathers obeyed shall be held sacred by their children from generation to genera tion for ever and ever Then the believer as though once more clearly to impress on his mind the precious teaching of Judaism again surveys the dogmas in which its belief is fully comprehended and here I cite JehudahaLevis own words namely the conviction of the existence of God of his eternity and his guidance of our fathers of the divine  Compare Schechter Jclish

committee with a power it could never exercise The committee the only one charged in law with the care of the incompetents property should be permitted to protect him from those who would take advantage of his unfortunate position It is submitted therefore that because of the inherent power of equity and the duty of the state toward the insane that the section should be liberally construed EFFECT OF EXEOUTION UNDER EQUAL JUDGMENT LIENSIn the recent case of Hulbert v Hulbert 1916 216 N Y 430 the New York Court of Appeals in reversing the Appellate Division has laid down the rule that as between judgments attaching simultaneously as liens to land subsequently acquired by the judgment debtor no priority can be obtained by the creditor first issuing execution1 The lack of authority on which the decision may be rested warrants an investigation of the principles underlying the hitherto generally accepted rule that priority can be gained in this manner The question may arise either from the simultaneous rendering entering or docketing of two or more judgments against the debtor who at that time owns land2 or from the acquisition of land by the debtor subsequent to the rendering entering or docketing of two or more judgments against him3 In both cases the liens attach simultaneously and the creditors must share pro rata if the property is not enough to satisfy both unless priority may be later acquired by the creditor first issuing execution entitling him to a full satisfaction of his judgment All authorities agree that priority may be so acquired and base their opinions on the New York cases of Adams v Dyer and Waterman v Haskin which are overruled by the principal case4 An attempt The decision of the Appellate Division is discussed in 15 Columbia Law Rev

applied to judgments entered on the same day is not applied to judgment liens on afteracquired property Kisterson v Tate 1895 94 Iowa 665 63 N W 350 NOTBS 237COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW is made in the latter to explain Adams v Dyer on the ground that the court erroneously supposed execution to be necessary to attach the lien and that the first execution established the first lien It is admitted that the effect of the statute then in force was to make the mere docketing of the judgment a lien without the necessity of execution but it is said that the court overlooked this An examination of Adams v Dyer and especially of Waterman v Haskin it is submitted permits of no such explanation The court clearly regarded the liens as equal at their inception and allowed the creditor first issuing exe cution to obtain priority as a reward for his vigilance6 The principal case is therefore irreconcilable with Adams v Dyer and all the other authorities and it cannot be supported on the ground of a change in the statute as it is admitted that the effect of the statute now as then was to make the mere docketing of the judgment create the lien In support of the decision it may be urged that it is in accord with the equitable tendency of the modern cases to place all creditors upon an equality that the former rule is harsh in its operation7 and that frequently the issuance of a prior execution is due not so much to vigilance as to the accidental discovery by one creditor of the subse ouent acquisition of the land by the judgment debtor which should not give him priority over the others On the other hand it is a cardinal doctrine of equity that vigilance shall be rewarded8 as in the case of the judgment creditor who files his bill to set aside a fraudulent conveyance by the debtor prior to the rendering of the judgment The instant title is revested in the debtor the liens of all judgment creditors attach simultaneously but the one who set aside the conveyance is given priority0 The issuance of an execution has always been regarded by equity whether rightly or no it is difficult to say as such vigilance as will entitle the creditor to priority10 and the result has been salutary in encouraging prompt action on the part of creditors In such a case therefore where the equities will fluctuate according to the peculiar facts the advantage to be gained by over turning the universally accepted doctrine of priority is so slight as not to warrant the extraordinary measure of judicial legislation resorted to in the principal case and it is submitted that stare decisis should have controlled Koning v Bayard 1829 14 Fed Cas 843 In Adams v Dyer the court says We must then consider the judgments equal as to the date of the lien and the next question is whether any priority hath subsequently been acquired In Waterman v Haskin the court says    a judgment lien attaches upon the time of filing the record of judgment See Patterson v Stephenson 188377 Mo 329 336

wide expanse isthreatened by ruin ruin compared to which the ravages of the phylloxera are mild The last news whichwe had from the westerrl prosince was that around Tlemgen on thefrontier flights o locusts were alightihg unintermittently and that a caravan just arrived there from Morocco had travelled for thirtytwo days in the midst of locusts the country beiig entirely devastated I have said enough to show how the central department of Algiers is threatened and now on the borders o1 Tunisia advancing from the east we had met once more with the dread hordes The night before our arrival at B6ne the frontier port a train coming thither from Tunis had been actually blocked for half an hour by a swarm at a little place called OuedZerga and in the capital of the Beys the natives svere trying to make the best of the plague by cooliing and selling the sauterelles for food I have not the space teven if I had the technical knowledge to describe the tneans by which Algerian cultivators are trying to stay the pest how they set about the unpleasant uTork of destroying the eggs and how after incubation they devise methods for stopping the march of the criguets which if unchecked literally eat their way along lea7ing the most verdant aud fertile tracts a hrown wilderness Suffice it to say that not only are thelocal authorities the maires and sousprefets organizing resistance arld raising subsidies for the struggle but what is more significant in a territory which is above all things a military trainingground for France the general commanding the forces in Algeria has granted a remission of thirteen days to all cultistators called to serve with the colors whose properties are menaced by the lo custs  5  My last glimpse of the country which I have the greatest reason for loving that a woman can have was across the vineyards whose leafy lines stretch in neverending vistas over the rich plains by the Tunisian frontier and I thought of the sinister Arab prophe cies which foretold that after the conquest by the Franks of this fair land an army of invaders worse earen than they should come up froul the desert and extend tbe boundaries of the Sahala to the shores of the Mediterlanean ATARIErY AND PLANTING OF CORN BULLETIN NO 15 of the Pennsylvania Agricultural Esperiment Station is a report of experiments on the influence of variety and the rate of seeding on the yield of ensilage corn Twovarieties of corn were planted one the field corn ordinarily grown in that locality the other Brecks Boston market ensilage a largegrow ing variety which barely reaches the gazing stage befoxe frost in that locality 6 Both varieties were sown in duplicate plots of two rates of seeding each the plots being alternated i Tke rows were three and a balf feet apart with guard rows hetween the plots so that the ground was all equally occupied Manure was applied liberally but by a mistake the thickseeded plots received larger quantities of manure as well as of seed The tbinseeded plots were planted ffO that the stalks stood fourteen inches apalt in the rows while on the thickseeded plots the stalks were three and a half inches apart The average yield of each pair of plots calculated to one acre was stnallthinseeded 11962 pounds small thickseedqd 19 013 pounds large thinseeded 20955 pounds large thickseeded 26840 pounds It appears therefcore that the larger variety gave a decidedly larger yield than the smaller one and that thick seed ing was decidedly more profitable than thin seedillg Chemkeal analyses were made of samples from the various plots frorn which it appeared that the produce of the larger variety and of the thicker seeding showed even greater superiority than that indicated by the gross yield Experiments similar to the foregoing have been conducted at the Ohio Experirnent Station over several seasons and these have uniformly showed a larger yield both of grain and fodder and therefore of food for animals when the corn was so planted  that the stalles stood about sis inches apart in rows about three and a half feet apart than when the distance between the stalks was greater As between planting six inches rapart and three inches apart the Ohio experialients showbetter results from the sisinch 33 planting Such close planting as this causes the ears to be chiefly nubbins and therefore it is not to be recommended when nlerchantable grain is the prodtlet desired but for silage purposes it is not ne cessary that the grain should be merchantable S   THE TRANSANDINE RAILWAY THE Transandine Railway now in process of construction across the Andes Mountains for the purpose of connecting the railway systems of Chili and the Argentine Eepublic is an enterprise in volving many engineering difflculties London Engineerang has devoted considerable space to a series of illustrated articles on the railway and its construction from which we gather the following facts The length of the new railway is 149 miles of which 109 miles are on Argentine territory starting from the city of Mendoza which is 2376 feet above the sea In Chili there are forty miles connectillg with the Chilian system at Santa Rosa 2704 feet above sealevel The greatest lzeight attained by the railway is 10460 feet above sealevel the tunnel at that point being sorne two thousand feet below the summit of the rnountains There are eight tunnelsS grouped near the summit aggregating 932 miles in length the longest the sunlmit tunnel having a length of 5540 yards To overcome a part of the difference in level within a short distance and at suitable working gradients it has been found necessary to construct a spiral tunnel 2061 wrards long with a radius of 200 metres and a grade of eight feet in a hundred It may be added that this grade is nlaintained through the whole nine miles of tunnelling except of course in the summit tunnel It is in the boring of these tunnels that the greatest engineering difficulties are encountered The absellce of fuel and the enor mous expense of obtaining it put steam out of the question as a motive power for driving the air conlpressors airactuated drills being the means employed for boring the tunnels Water power the only other means available was to be had but at a considera ble distance from the work It was therefore decided to use the waterpower for driving electrodynamos transmit the electric current by copper conductors to the sites selected for the com pressors convert it into power by means of electromotors therReby actuating the compressors and furnishing compressed air for thc drills The installations for this purpose are unique as it is 0 probably the first time tllat the power for compressing airsfor drills has been conveyed such a distance by electric cables There are three installations one upon the Argentine aIld two OI1 the Chilian side of the Andes each being distinct in all points except that the primary stations on the Chilian sidc are both located at one place Each installation has a primarzy statlon where the turbines and dynamos are situated and a secondary station with electromotors an alr compressors The Chilian installation consists of two primary stations under one roof at Juncal with secondarv stations at Juncalillo and Cala vera and separate cables for transmitting the current The power s for driving the turbines is obtained frorn the Quebrada Juncalillo the water being conveyed to the turbines a distance of 1420 yards by a double line of steel pipes The primary station at Juncal for the Juncalillo station consists of six Girard turbines each giving 80 horsepower a total of 480 horsepower Each 80 horsepower turbine is coupled directly to the shaft of an 80 horsepower dy narno consequently there will be no loss of power in transmission from the turbines to the dynamos The latter are grouped in two groups of three dynamos each each group having a main and return transmission able A great advantage is gained in having two groups as should accidents or other cause prXvent one from being svorlied the whole of the tunnelling svould not be stopped At the secondary statiorl at Juncalillo about 3 281 yards from Jun cal the power available is 4018 horsepower cables being attached to six electric motors similar to the 80 horsepower dynamos which drive six air compressors The JuncalCalavera installation is very similar to the one de scribed above The turbines are in the same shed and take their water from the same source These and the dynamos are also of

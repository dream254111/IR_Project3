1908 President Bauer in the chair The meeting was devoted exclusively to hearing addresses commemorative of the life and labors of the late Lord Kelvin The first paper of the evening was entitled Lord Kelvin His Life and Works delivered by invitation by Professor Arthur G Webster cf Worcester Mass Dr R S Woodward spoke of Lord Kel vins Contributions to Geophysics Professor Simon Newcomb told of  Lord Kelvins Character and Personality By invitation his excellency the British ambassador Mr James Bryce favored the meeting with an interesting sketch of Lord Kelvins life bearing testimony to the sim plicity of Lord Kelvins character and the greatness of his wonderful mind The full text of the foregoing addresses are soon to be published as a part of Bulletin XV of the Philosophical Society of Washington THE 644th meeting was held on February 1 1908 Professor C F Marvin gave a description of  A Universal Seismograph for Horizontal Motion recently designed by him at the U S Weather Bureau A full description of this instrument prepared by Professor Mar vin is soon to appear in the Monthly Weather Review The second paper of the evening was pre sented by Professor Frank H Bigelow upon  Relations of the Temperatures of the United States to Solar Radiation The natural synchronism between the vari able action of the solar radiation and the ter restrial temperatures may be missed in an investigation in three ways 1 The use of nonhomogeneous data at the sun and at the2310 SCIENCE N S VOL XXVII No 686 earth 2 the application of analytic methods based on perfect periods for the solar varia tions which are only roughly periodic 3 the omission to consider the important effects of atmospheric circulation upon the observed temperatures The temperatures of the United States are very indirect functions of the solar radiation depending upon trans ported heat more than upon direct radiation Many years have been consumed in securing homogeneous data but we now possess tables covering the interval from 1872 to 1905 for the solar prominence frequencies the Euro pean horizontal magnetic force the tempera tures vapor pressures and barometric pres sures of the United States comprising more than one hundred stations The monthly means were in all cases computed from the daily values reduced to homogeneous condi tions for the interval This paper refers only to the variations of the annual means of the several elements and these are separated into two portions by eliminating the short period ordinates of about three years from the long period ordinates of about eleven years The result is approximately as follows Referring to an earlier paper it was shown there that the temperatures in the tropics vary directly but in the temperate zones inversely with the solar prominence frequencies and that the pressures of the eastern hemisphere vary directly but of the western hemisphere in versely as a general rule In this paper it is shown that these rules hold good in the United States with certain local modifica tions due to the general circulation of the atmosphere In the Pacific states the syn chronism of the temperatures is direct while east of the Rocky Mountains it is inverse The elevenyear period is well defined in the Pacific States but is nearly wiped out by the circulation east of the mountains The three year period persists in each district but a partial inversion and a lag of a few months is indicated east of the Rocky Mountains These and other similar results are the direct products of circulation since the California district is really a part of the system of the tropics because the highpressure belt crosses the United States from Florida to Oregon and thence passes southwestward These in versions are naturally connected with the general circulation An increase in solar radiation inferred from an increase in the number of the solar prominences and the strength of the magnetic field causes in crease of temperature and circulation in the tropic zone but a decrease of the tempera ture in the middle latitudes because the return currents from the polar zones bring an excess of cold high areas into the United States The temperature for a given year in a given locality is due to the transported heat primarily which rather remotely depends upon the prevailing radiation Aside from the great difficulty of securing homogeneous tables of the solar radiation by observations with the pyrheliometer on account of the difficulty of eliminating the local absorptions due to the meteorological conditions of the atmosphere above the station it is yet more difficult to make allowances for the effect of circulation The statistical method of recording the facts must be pursued without interruption for many years and then this historical record will gradually build up laws which will have a practical value in seasotial forecasts The U S Weather Bureau now possesses a set of homogeneous records covering one third of a century and all its observations are now made so as to continue these synchronous data in a perfectly automatic manner R L FARIS Secretary THE CHEIMICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON AT the twentyfourth annual meeting of the

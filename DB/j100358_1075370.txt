J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1075370,REPORT OF A MEMBER OF THE COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAMINATION BOARD,I244580,REPORT OF A MEMBER OF THE COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAMINATION BOARD WILLIAM GALLAGHER MR PRESIDENT I HAVE NO ELABORATE REPORT TO MAKE THE FACT IS THAT I ONLY WISH THAT I COULD RECEIVE FROM THE MEMBERS OF THIS BODY CRITICISMS THAT WILL LEAD US TO MAKE THE EXAMINATIONS MORE USEFUL TO THE SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES IN NEW ENGLAND THAT ARE INTERESTED IN THIS BOARD THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR THAT THIS BODY HAS BEEN REPRESENTED AND I THINK PERHAPS I MIGHT TAKE A VERY FEW MOMENTS TO INDICATE THE PLAN OF OPERATIONS THE BOARD IS COMPOSED OF REPRESENTATIVES OF TWENTYSEVEN DIFFERENT COLLEGES AND REPRESENTATIVES OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS CHOSEN FROM SUCH BODIES AS OURS OF THE TWENTYSEVEN COLLEGES FIVE ARE IN NEW ENGLANDMOUNT HOLYOKE WELLESLEY HARVARD BROWN AND THE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY IN VERY MANY CASES THE PRESIDENT OF THE COLLEGE SERVES AS ITS REPRESENTATIVE I SHOULD SAY THAT IN MOST CASES THE PRESIDENT OR THE DEAN OF THE COLLEGE IS PRESENT THERE ARE THEN ADDED TO THAT BODY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SECON DARY SCHOOLS ON THIS BASIS FIVE AND NO MORE THAN FIVE ARE TO BE CHOSEN FROM THE MIDDLE STATES BOARD FROM NEW ENGLAND ONE DELEGATE IS TO BE CHOSEN FOR EVERY THREE COLLEGES REPRESENTED IN THE BOARD THAT GENERAL BOARD MEETS TWICE A YEAR IN NOVEMBER AND MAY SPENDING A SATURDAY TOGETHER FOR GENERAL PURPOSES OF ADMINISTRATIONI MEAN IN THE BROAD SENSE OF THE WORD OF COURSE THE DETAILS ARE CARRIED OUT BY AN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AND THE SECRETARY IN REGARD TO THE MATTER OF EXAMINATIONS THE VITAL POINT WHERE THE SCHOOLS AND THE COLLEGES TOUCH THE PROCESS IS THIS THE STUDIES ARE DIVIDED INTO THIRTEEN DEPARTMENTS IN EACH DEPARTMENT THERE ARE THREE EXAMINERS TWO FROM THE COLLEGES ONE FROM THE SCHOOLS THESE THREE UNITE TO PREPARE THE PAPERS IN THE PARTICULAR SUBJECT I THINK SOMETIMES THEY ARE PREPARED BY ONE PERSON AND THEN THE OTHER TWO ARE CONSULTED SOMETIMES AS I UNDERSTAND IT THEY ARE DIVIDED BETWEEN THE THREE SOMETIMES THEY ARE PREPARED BY PERSONAL CONFERENCE SOMETIMES BY CORRESPONDENCE BUT THE PAPERS ARE PREPARED IN THE FIRST PLACE BY TWO COLLEGE REPRESENTATIVES AND ONE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SCHOOLS THESE PAPERS ARE ALL PRINTED AND ON A SATURDAY IN FEBRUARY ARE SUBMITTED TO THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOLSFIVE FROM THE MIDDLE STATES ONE FROM NEW ENGLAND AND ONE 80O802 THE SCHOOL REVIEW FROM THE CENTRAL STATESWHO SPEND ALL DAY IN CRITICAL EXAMINATION IT IS NO SINECURE IT IS A LONG DAYS WORK IT IS A HARD DAYS WORK SOME TIMES IT IS DIFFICULTIT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE IN FACTTO DO FULL JUSTICE TO IT IN ONE DAY A WEEK OR TWO LATER TWO DAYS ARE TAKEN BY THESE SEVEN REPRE SENTATIVES OF THE SCHOOLS AND THE THIRTEEN EXAMINERS THAT MEANS THIRTEEN COLLEGE MEN THE LEADING EXAMINER IN EACH DEPARTMENT IS ON THAT BOARD THERE ARE TWENTY WHO COME TOGETHER THIRTEEN REPRESENTING THE COLLEGES AND SEVEN THE SCHOOLS AND THE NOTES THAT THE SECONDARYSCHOOL MEN MADE ON THAT PREVIOUS SATURDAY ARE BROUGHT BEFORE THE BOARD AND CONSULTATION IS HELD THIS HAS BEEN AS FAR AS I CAN JUDGE IN THE SHORT TIME I HAVE HAD TO DO WITH THE BOARD A VERY SATISFACTORY ARRANGEMENT WE HAVE BEEN ENABLED TO TALK FREELY WITH ONE ANOTHER I AM SURE THAT WE HAVE BEEN MET BY THE COLLEGE PEOPLE WITH THE GREATEST CORDIALITY AND SYMPATHY AND THE EVIDENT AIM HAS BEEN TO SECURE IMPROVEMENTS AND TO ERADICATE SUCH ERRORS AS HAVE BEEN MADE MANIFEST IN PRACTICE THE COMMITTEE OR THIS SMALLER BODY WILL WELCOME ALWAYS ANY CRITICISM THAT CAN BE MADE I SENT OUT ONE HUNDRED CARDS LAST YEAR TO MEMBERS OF THIS ORGANIZATION AND I RECEIVED SEVEN ANSWERS SOME OF THE ANSWERS WERE OF A VERY LIMITED CHARACTER REALLY NOT GIVING ME MUCH BASIS TO WORK ON SOME OF THEM WERE VERY PRACTICAL BUT THEY HAD MORE TO DO WITH QUES TIONS OF ADMINISTRATION THAN WITH QUESTIONS THAT WE COULD MEET IN OUR SMALL BOARD I WISH THE MEMBERS WHO ARE HERE AND ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE BODY TO WRITE ME IN THE FRANKEST WAY COMPLAIN ALL YOU PLEASE AND THEN AT THE END OF THE COMPLAINT GIVE ME A PRACTICAL SUGGESTION AND I SHALL BE VERY GLAD TO BRING IT BEFORE THE BOARD BUT WIHEN THE CRITICISM OF THE WHOLE GERMAN EXAMINATION IS LIMITED TO THE FACT THAT IN A CERTAIN CASE AN A THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PRINTED AS A CAPITAL WAS PRINTED AS A SMALL LETTEROF COURSE A BAD THING TO DO AND WE WANT TO HAVE THOSE ERRORS COR RECTEDTHERE IS NOT VERY MUCH GROUND FOR CHANGING ANY GERMAN SET WE WANT TO CORRECT BLEMISHES BUT WE REALLY WOULD WELCOME A BROADER AND A FULLER AND MORE VITAL SORT OF CRITICISM EVEN THOUGH IT HURTS I WOULD RATHER BE HURT A LITTLE THAN TO GO ON TO NEW YORK FOR TWO DAYS FOR SURFACE CRITICISM NOW SOME QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ASKED ME OF THIS SORT DO YOU FIND THERE IS GOOD GIVEANDTAKE A FAIR MATTER OF ACCOMMODATION  CERTAINLY LET ME INSTANCE ONE THING THE REMARK WAS MADE WITH REFERENCE TO A CERTAIN QUESTION I SHOULD LIKE TO EXCLUDE THAT QUESTION IF YOU PLEASE WHY  THE EXAMINER SAID BECAUSE THE BOOKS DIFFER SO IN THE INTER PRETATION OF THAT LINE WHY I WAS NOT AWARE OF ANY DIFFERENCE IN THE INTERPRETATION IF THERE IS WE CERTAINLY OUGHT NOT TO PUT IT BEFORE SCHOLARSCOLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAMINATION BOARD REPORT 803 HERE I DONT OBJECT TO THE QUESTION AT ALL IN THE CLASSROOM WE ALL TREAT THE QUESTION IN OUR CLASSES BUT THERE IS THIS DIFFERENCE OF OPINION IN THE TEXTBOOKS AND THE HEAD EXAMINER SAID STRIKE IT OUT IMMEDIATELY WE DONT WANT TO SET ANY QUESTION KNOWINGLY THAT SHALL PUT THAT SORT OF A DILEMMA BEFORE THE PUPILS IN GENERAL I THINK THE PRESENTATION OF THE DIFFICULTIES ON THE PART OF THE SCHOOLMEN HAS BEEN VERY FAVORABLY RECEIVED I REMEMBER AS WE LOOKED OVER THE ELEMENTARY LATIN PAPER THAT WE WERE SATISFIED IT WAS TOO LONG WE RAN THROUGH THE PAPER ANSWERED IT OUR SELVES AND IMAGINED OUSELVES SITTING DOWN AND DOING THE ALLOTTED AMOUNT OF WORK IN THE GIVEN TIME WE CUT OUT ONEHALF OF THE FIRST QUESTION RIGHT AWAY THAT WAS RECEIVED MOST FAVORABLY IN SOME DEPARTMENTS I WILL SAY FRANKLY THAT I HOPE WE SHALL HAVE MODIFICATIONS BUT YOU CAN SEE WHAT THAT MEANS YOU REMEMBER THAT THIS ASSOCIATION APPOINTED A SPLENDID COMMITTEE SOME YEARS AGO TO GET UP A BOARD LIKE THIS AND WE PRINTED A LONG PAMPHLET AND WE DISCUSSED IT HERE YOU KNOW IN ONE OF OUR REGULAR MEETINGS AND AGAIN IN A SPECIAL MEETING AND THEN FINALLY THE WHOLE THING WAS DROPPED SOMEHOW WE COULD NOT EVEN GET IT LAUNCHED HERE WELL THEY GOT IT LAUNCHED DOWN THERE AND THEY ARE EXAMINING THIS YEAR I THINK UPWARD OF TWO THOUSAND CANDIDATES IN LOOKING OVER THE LIST OF A YEAR AGO I FOUND THAT THERE WERE SOME 350 OF THE 800OO CANDIDATES OF THAT YEAR WHO SIGNIFIED THEIR INTENTION OF GOING TO SOME NEW ENGLAND COLLEGE SO THAT WE ARE MAKING A VERY LARGE USE OF THAT BOARD THE ONLY PRACTICAL WAY INDEED IN WHICH WE CAN MAKE OUR VOICE EFFICIENT WOULD BE BY THE EXPRESSION THROUGH YOUR DELEGATE OF THE MOST DECIDED SORT OF CRITICISM WHILE I AM ONLY ONE IN SEVEN AND WE SEVEN ARE ONLY ONETHIRD OF THE LARGER BODY I AM SURE THAT WITH THE SLOWNESS THAT MUST ATTEND THE MOVEMENT OF SUCH BODIES WE MAY EVERY YEAR COME NEARER AND NEARER TO THAT IDEAL PLAN WHICH OF COURSE WE NEVER SHALL REALIZE BUT WHICH WE MAY APPROXIMATE OF COURSE THE UNDERLYING THE INEVITABLE TROUBLE WHICH CAN ONLY BE MODIFIED BY CONFERENCE ARISES FROM THE ABSORPTION OF THE SPECIALIST IN HIS LINE IT IS HARD FOR ANY ONE OF US TO REALIZE AFTER WE HAVE TAUGHT TEN OR TWELVE YEARS IN ONE LINE THAT THESE YOUNGSTERS DO NOT SEE THE THING AS QUICKLY AS WE DO AND THAT THE YOUTH OF SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN CANNOT ATTEND TO THOSE THINGS ON PAPERS AS PROMPTLY AS WE CAN AFTER OUR YEARS OF SERVICE I HAD THIS LAST WINTER AN ILLUSTRATION ON A SMALL SCALE OF WHAT IS LIABLE TO OCCUR ALL ALONG THE LINE A GENTLEMEN WHO HAS BEEN MOST SYMPATHETIC WITH ALL THIS WORK AND HAS PUT HIMSELF IN DIRECT RELATIONS WITH THIS BODY SAID IN THE COURSE OF AN ADMIRABLE SERIES OF TALKS ON TEACHING LATIN NOW DONT LET YOUR STUDENTS THINK ABOUT HORSE HAVE THEM THINK ABOUT804 THE SCHOOL REVIEW EQUUS RIGHT OFF I THINK WE LOSE SIGHT OF THAT THE SAME YEAR THE FRENCH TEACHER SAYS NOW LOOK HERE BOYS YOU MUST NOT THINK OF HORSE THINK OF CHEVAL AND THE STUDENT COMES TO ME NEXT YEAR AND I SAY YOU DONT WANT TO THINK ABOUT HORSE NO THINK OF HIPPOS AS SOON AS YOU SEE THE ANIMAL THE GERMAN TEACHER WANTS TO DO THE SAME THING WHEN THE STUDENT GETS TO HIM AND HE SAYS OH YOU MUST NOT THINK OF HORSE YOU MUST THINK OF PFERD WHEN YOU SEE THE ANIMAL COMING DOWN THE STREET WHAT IS THE BOY GOING TO DO  SHALL IT BE CHEVAL OR EQUUS OR HIPPOS OR PFERD  A FRIEND OF MINE REMARKED AFTER THE LECTURE THAT A BOY MIGHT HAVE A TREMENDOUS APPETITE FOR KNOWLEDGE BUT HE COULD NOT BE POLYGLUTTONOUS ENOUGH FOR THAT GRADUALLY THE THING WILL GET INTO SHAPE BUT IT WILL GET INTO SHAPE I AM CERTAIN FROM THE SECONDARYSCHOOL SIDE ONLY AS THE DELEGATE FROM THIS BODY WHOEVER HE MAY BE IS STRENUOUSLYI INSIST ON THAT WORD STRENUOUS IS STRENUOUSLY CRITICISED AND DICTATED TO IF YOU PLEASE BY THE MEMBERS OF THIS BODY SO THAT HE MAY CARRY SOMETHING PRACTICAL TO WORK UPON WHEN HE GOES TO NEW YORK IT IS NO SINECURE I ADMIT THAT IT IS SOMETIMES HARD TO GET AWAY FROM MY SCHOOL GO ON AT NIGHT AND WORK ALL THE NEXT DAY AND COME BACK IN THE NIGHT AND ON ONE OCCASION TAKE TWO DAYS AWAY FROM THE SCHOOL BUT I AM VERY GLAD TO DO IT AS I SAY IF I CAN HAVE STRENUOUS AND VITAL CRITICISM

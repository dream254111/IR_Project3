Faculty of Economics University of London I AM entirely in agreement with Professor Cassels explanation of the general rise of prices and of what is called the dislocation of the ex changes I applaud his exposure of the folly of supposing that a hoard of gold which no one may draw upon is of some immediate use in supporting the value of a paper currency and I welcome his support for the doctrine which I have without much success been trying to teach the public that the high profits supposed to be due to some witchcraft called profiteer ing are simply the result of a depre ciating currency which means a rise of prices between the time of buying and the time of selling As to reme84 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY dies also I am in agreement with him I am only inclined to add a little with out taking away anything First I think it should be clearly understood that a discount policy is not likely to work unless those who have to put it in force recognize that the purpose of it is to reduce the currency and are themselves in sym pathy with this purpose I do not believe for example that the Bank of England could bring the pound up to its proper value of 113 grains of fine gold or 486 by putting the bank rate up unless the other banks and the government saw that what was wanted was to reduce the outstanding amount of bank notes and currency usually called treasury notes and were really desirous that the reduction should take place Consequently I put more faith in direct action for reducing currency In England at any rate it is perfectly easy for the government to reduce the banknote currency by a very large amount in a very short time and without any expense but with considerable profit Gold equal to a hundred and thirteen million sovereigns is held by the Bank of England against its notes The notes are convertible but if a private person presumes to convert them and then to export or melt the gold the government can and does prosecute him no one however can prosecute the government itself for drawing out and exporting as much gold as it can present notes for The British Government therefore unlike all other institutions and persons is able to pro cure with 1 what will pay a debt of nearly 486 in America since it alone is able not only to get five sovereigns with a 5 Bank of England note but also to send the sovereigns abroad to be sold for what they will fetch If as is probable it shrinks from thus affronting the worshippers of gold backing it can still reduce the cur rency notes by the simple process of getting some of them in by taxes or by borrowing at interest and can celling them Of course any of these methods will tend to cause an imme diate rise in the money market rate of interest but I do not think a rise so caused would excite nearly so much opposition as what would be called an artificial rise brought about for the purpose of reducing the currency Secondly I think it is necessary to insist strongly on the fact that each country acting alone however indebted and poverty stricken it may be has the power of bringing its moneyits unit of accountinto some fixed relation with gold and keeping it there It may be impossible or if not impos sible very undesirable for Germany to bring the mark up to the value of 24 cents but it is quite possible for Germany alone to fix the mark at 1 cent or some rather higher figure and very desirable that it should do so To cure the violent variations in exchange which are the real evil of the dislocation what is required is for each of the countries not at present on a gold standard to come back to that standard no matter so far as civilization in general is concerned what particular rate each of them may having regard to its own circumstances find convenient This is not a matter for international action and nothing but harm is done by the perpetual sug gestion that the United States or all the countries with the least depreciated currencies are to take steps to rehaDISCUSsIONS 285 bilitate the more depreciated curren cies of other countries It is only after civilization has been restored by the reestablishment of the common monetary unit ie an ounce of pure gold which prevailed before the war throughout all the world except a portion of the east where silver was the unit and a few disor dered localities in the west that inter national action is admissible There is no need for the restoration of gold as a standard to cause a great additional demand for it There is no reason for giving up the circulation of paper and taking again to pockets and tills full of heavy metal We in England do not want sovereigns and half sovereigns again we should have discarded them long ago like the ScotcTh and Irish and the inhabitants of most of the white colonies if our banks convenience had not caused our legislature to persist in the prohibi tion of notes under 5 The stocks of gold in the banks and these hoarded away for the present by individuals are together quite sufficient to provide the reserves necessary for keeping the different paper currencies in their proper relation to each other and to gold But the infirmities of reasoning power in the human race and the back ward state of elementary instruction in economics are such that it is possible as Professor Cassel fears that the restoration of the gold standard may be accompanied by a large demand for gold for currencies and reserves even if it takes place as the consid ered policy of governments There is another possibilitythat gold may be restored as a standard by the people independently of their governments Tired of the perpetual depreciation of paper money people have often refused to deal in it any more and have taken in spite of their government to buying and selling in metal instead of notes if this should happen as we are told it has already happened in Mexico there would necessarily be a large demand for gold for currency It may be therefore that the res toration of the gold standard in the absence of corrective measures may involve a great and inconvenient drop in prices when reckoned in that standard On the other hand nothing of this kind may occur Professor Fisher may be right in believing that the demand for and the supply of gold will be in such relation that prices in gold will not fall but will go on rising as they went on rising before the war and that to an inconvenient extent If pressed for a guess I should be inclined to hazard that the immediate result of the restoration will be a fall of prices but that the old rise would soon be resumed The thing that is most unlikely is that gold would be very stable When my grandmother was told by one of her sons that he intended to trust in Providence she retorted I never saw any good come of that If mankind wants a stable standard they must bestir themselves to make one and not trust that Provi dence will arrange that gold or any other particular metal shall always buy the same quantity of goods in general

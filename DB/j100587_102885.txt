J100587,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16831775,102885,PART OF A LETTER TO DR MEAD CONCERNING SECRETIONS ON AN ANIMAL BODY BY JOS MORLAND M D,I206888,1292 I PART OF A LETTER TO DR MEAD CONCERNING SECRETIONS M AN ANIMAL BODY BY JOS MORLAND M D  ANDI INDEED NO ONE WHO HAS ENDEAVOUR ED TO EXPLAIN THE MANNER BY WHICH SE CRETIONS ARE PERFORMED SEEMS TO ME TO HAVE GIVEN A SATIS FACTORY ACCOUNT OF THAT MATTER NOR DO I DOUBT BUT THAT A MAN OF YOUR SAGACITY AND SKILL IN THESE AFFAIRS CAN DISCOVER THE DEFECTS OF THE SEVERAL OPINIONS OF THE AUTHORS CONCERN ING THEM I SHALL THEREFORE PROPOSE MY OPINION AS BRIEFLY AS I CAN IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE WHOLE BUSINESS MAY BE REDUCED TO THIS DOUBLE ENQUIRY 1ST HOW A THIN FLUID SUCH AS IS THE URINE MAY BE SEPARATED FROM THE MASS OF BLOOD AND THE REMAINING PARTS OF THE BLOOD CIRCULATE BACK TO THE HEART 2DLY HOW A THICK FLUID SUCH AS IS THE BILE OR SEMEN FOR EXAMPLE MAY BE SEPARATED FROM THE MASS OF BLOOD AND THE OTHER FLUIDS BOTH THINNER AND THICKER THAN THIS PARTICU LAR FLUID TO BE SEPARATEDCIRCULATE BACK TO THE HEARTAND THAT I MAY BE THE MORE PLAIN I SHALL GIVE A GENERAL IDEA OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE GLANDS A GLAND I CONCEIVE TO BE COM POSED 1ST OF THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THE BLOOD VESSELS INCLOSED IN A COMMON MEMBRANE WHICH SENDS OFF SEVERAL FIBRES BY WHICH THESE MINUTE VESSELS ARE TIED TOGETHER AND THAT THE VEINS ARE A CONTINUATION OF THE ARTERIES OF THIS DR ARESKIN HAS FULLY CONVINCED US BY AN INIECTION OF WAX IN AN HNMANE BODY SO DEXTROUSLY PERFORMED THAT THE WAX BEING INJECT ED BY THE ARTERIES FILLED THE VEINS AT THE SAME TIME AND AF TERWARDS BY A NICE DISSECTION OF THE PART WHERE THE CONTI NUATION OF THE SMALL RAMIFICATIONS OF THE ARTERIES AND VEINS APPEARED TO THE NAKED EYE 2DLY1293 2DLY I CONCEIVE THAT WHEN THE BRANCHES OF THE ARTERIES BEGIN TO GROW VERY SMALL THEY SEND OFF SEVERAL DUCTS WHOSE ORIFICES ARE OF DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS THESE DUCTS ARE OF 2 SORTS THE FIRST OF THESE WHICH IN THE SAME ARTERY ARE ALWAYS SMALLER THAN THE 2D PASS IMMEDIATELY FROM THE ARTERY AND OPEN INTO THE VEINS THE SECOND WHICH PASS OFF NEARER TO THE EXTREMITY OF THE ARTERIES UNITE AND CARRY OFF A LIQUOR FROM THE MASS OF BLOOD FOR PARTICULAR ENDS IN SEVERAL PARTS OF THE BODY IT IS TO BE OBSERVED THAT IN ONE CASE THE SECOND SORT ARE ONLY TO BE FOUND I IMAGINE THAT A THIN FLUID MAY BE SECERND FROM A THICK ONE WHEN THE ORIFICES OF THE SECRETORY DUCTS ARE SO SMALL AS TO ADMIT NO OTHER BUT THAT THIN FLUID AND THAT AT THE SAME TIME THE REMAINING PARTS OF THE BLOOD WHICH ARE THICKER CONTINUE THEIR COURSE IN THE VESSEL AGAIN I IMAGINE THAT A THICK FLUID MAY BE SECERND WHEN THE THINNER PARTS ARE CARRIED OFF SOME OTHER WAY SO THAT THE LIQUOR TO BE SECERNED WILL BE THE THINNEST OF THE REMAINING MASS UPON THESE PRINCIPLES I THINK IT WILL BE EASIE TO EXPLAIN THE DOCTRINE OF SECRETIONS AND NOW IN THE FIRST PLACE LET US EXAMINE HOW THE THINNER SECRETIONS ARE PERFORMED AS FOR INSTANCE THE URINE WHEN THE BLOOD BY THE CONTRACTION OF THE HEART IS PUSHT INTO THE ARTERIES THEY ARE DILATED WHICH AGAIN CONTRACTING THEMSELVES PUSH IT FORWARD INTO ALL THE PARTS OF THE BODY AND AMONGST THE REST INTO THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THE ARTERIES OF WHICH THE GLANDS OF THE KIDNEYS ARE COMPOSD BY THIS MEANS THE BLOOD PASSES BY THE ORIFICES OF THE SECRETORY DUCTS WHEN THESE ARTERIES CONTRACT THEMSELVES THEY PRESS THE BLOOD AND FORCE THE THINNER PARTS INTO THE ORIFICES OF THOSE DUCTS WHICH WILL ADMIT NO THICKER FLUID AND CARRY IT TOWARD THE PELUIS AND THE REMAINING PART OF THE BLOOD INTO THE VEINS BY THEM TO BE CARRYD BACK TO THE HEART THUS A THIN1294 THIN LIQUOR MAY BE SEPARATED FROM THE MASS OF BLOOD IN THE SECOND PLACE LET US EXAMINE HOW A THICK LIQUOR MAY BE SEPARATED FROM THE MASS OF BLOOD WHERE THINNER LI QUORS ARE MIXT WITH IT FOR INSTANCE LET US TAKE THE GALL OR SEMEN WHEN THE BLOOD IS PUSHT INTO THE CELIAC OR MESENTERIC ARTERIES TIS FORCED TO PASS INTO THE GLANDS OF THE STOMACH PANCREAS SPLEEN AND INTESTINES C WHERE THE LIQUOR GA STRICUS SUCCUS PANCREATICUS LIQUOR INTESTINALIS ARE SEPARATED BY THE ABOVEMENTIOND METHOD THE BLOOD THUS ROBBD OF VARIOUS THIN LIQUORS IS PUSHD ON INTO THE VEINS WHICH ANSWER TO THESE ARTERIES WHICH VEINS UNITE AND FORM A LARGE TRUNC CALLED THE VENA PORTA WHICH ENTERING INTO THE SUBSTANCE OF THE LIVER BY ITS SMALL RAMIFICATIONS CHIEFLY FORMS THE GLANDS OF WHICH THE LIVER IS COMPOSD HERE AGAIN ALL THE FLUIDS CONTAIND IN THE VENA PORTA WHICH ARE THINNER THAN THE BILE ARE SEPARATED FROM THIS MASS OF BLOOD BY THE FIRST SORT OF SECRETORY DUCTS WHICH WE SAID OPENED INTO THE VEINS AND THERE ARE DISCHARGED AND MIXT WITH THE BLOOD WHICH IS PASSING TOWARD THE HEART AT THE SAME TIME THE BILE WITH THE REST OF THE BLOOD WHICH IS THICKER CONTINUES ITS COURSE IN THE ARTERY NOW ALL THE THIN LIQUORS BEING SEPARATED THE BILE IS THE THINNEST PART OF THIS MASS OF BLOOD AND SO MAY BE RECEIVED BY EXCRETORY DUCTS WHICH ARE CAPABLE TO RECEIVE IT AND NO OTHER THE SEMEN BEING A VERY THICK LIQUOR IS SEPARATED MUCH AFTER THE SAME MANNER VIZ THE BLOOD BEING PUSHT INTO THE SPERMATICK ARTERIES PASSES INTO THE SUBSTANCE OF THE TESTICLES WHERE ALL THE LIQUORS THAT ARE THINNER THAN THAT OUT OF WHICH THE SEMEN IS TO BE TAKEN ARE SEPARATED BY THE FIRST SORT OF SECRETORY DUCTS AND CARRIED BACK TO THE MASS OF BLOOD THEN THIS LIQUOR SEMINALIS BEING THE THINNEST PART OF THE RE MAINING MASS IS SEPARATED BY ENCRETORY DUCTS CAPABLE TO RECEIVE IT AND NO OTHER AFTER THE LIQUOR SEMINALIS IS SEPA RATED FROM THE MASS OF BLOOD BY THE AFORESAID METHOD IT IS PUSHT FORWARD INTO THE ENCRETORY DUCTS WHERE THERE ARE OTHER DUCTS WHICH TAKE THEIR ORIGIN ALL A LONG FROM THEM WHICH1295 WHICH DUCTS ARE CAPABLE TO RECEIVE THE THINNEST PARTS OF THE LIQUOR SEMINALIS AND CONVEY THEM TO THE MASS OF BLOOD AND THUS THE SEMEN IS LEFT BEHIND TO PASS INTO THE VAS DEFERENS AND TIS WORTH REMARKING THAT AS THE SEMEN GROWS THICK ER AND THICKER BY CONTINUAL SEPARATION THE CANAL IN WHICH IT IS TO RUN GROWS LARGER AND LARGER AS APPEARS BY THE STRUCTURE OF THE TESTICLES EPIDIDYMIS AND VAS DEFERENS HENCE WE MAY GIVE A TRUE ACCOUNT WHY THE CANALS OF WHICH THE TESTICLES ARE COMPOSED ARE SO LONG VIZ THAT THERE MIGHT BE TIME ENOUGH TO SEPARATE ALL THE THIN FLUIDS BY THIS METHOD WE SEE HOW THE THICKEST AND THINNEST FLUIDS MAY BE SEPARATED FROM THE MASS OF BLOOD AND HOW INTERMEDIATE LIQUORS MAY BE SEPARATED AFTER THE SAME MANNER BY CANALS OF INTERMEDIATE DIMENSIONS THUS IN A WORD THE WHOLE DOCTRINE OF SECRETIONS MAY BE REDUCD TO THIS TO SEPARATE A LIQUOR OF ANY DETERMIND THICKNESS ALL THE FLUIDS WHICH ARE THINNER MUST BE CARRYD OFF BY SMALL CANALS AND THE LIQUOR TO BE SEPARATED BEING THE THINNEST OF THE RE MAINING MASS IS SECERNED BECAUSE THE DUCTS ARE CAPABLE TO RECEIVE IT AND NO OTHER COROLLARYS 1 HENCE THE USE OF THE SPLEEN IS EVIDENT 2 HENCE APPEARS THE ORIGIN AND USE OF THE LYMPHATICKS 3 HENCE THE TEXTURE AND USE OF MANY MINUTE PARTS OF THE BODY MAY BE DISCOVERED WHICH HITHERTO HAS BEEN UN KNOWN YOU KNOW SIR OF HOW GREAT MOMENT SUCH CONSIDERATI ONS AS THESE ARE TO THE KNOWLEDGE BOTH OF THE CAUSE AND CURE OF MANY DISTEMPERS HAVING ALREADY IN SOME DEGREE CONVINCD THOSE WHO ARE THE ONLY CAPABLE JUDGES OF THESE MATTERS THAT MECHANICAL ENQUIRIES INTO THE ANIMAL OECO P P P P P P P NO1296 NOMY ARE THE BEST FOUNDATION UPON WHICH WE CAN SAFELY PROCEED IN THE PRACTICE

expect The probability that the actual number of successes shall differ from the probable number in either direction by so much as 57 in 2927 trials by 2 in s trials say is approximately  r  1I e  te t which gives in the present case 1 that is to say there is in reality one chance in seventy of so great a deviation arising by accident while Richet would make it fifty in fiftyone We repeat that many of Mr Richets experiments are interesting and the results very striking It is a pity that they are not more effective than they are in placing the question of mental suggestion upon a scientific basis CIIRISTINE LADD FRANKLIN THE DIMENSIONS OF SHIPS I HAVE often thought tliat in practising the art of shipbuilding men have too mnjch neglected the study of the forms of the fish whiclh make the waters their permanent habitation and are designed for the most part to attain the highest degree of velocity in the pursuit of their prey No doubt the case of a ship partly and that of a fish wholly immersed are not strictly parallel but they offer very many points for comparison of which we may avail ourselves A fish makes use of its tailfinl as the chief and nearly sole instrument of propulsion and in the adoption of the screwpropeller in preference to the old sidewheels the steamers of the present day have secured a great advantage over the old forms In the proportion of length to those of breadth and depth however although there has of late been some im provement there would appear to be a lingering ten dency to hold by the old mistaken idea that a ship was rather to be regarded as a wedge to cut the water than as occupying the space of a wave of displace ment and so we have ships nine ten or even eleven times as long as broad and twenty times the length that they have draught Now knowing as we do the magnitude of the skinresistance in ships and its smallness in the oily coats of fishes one would expect that the length of the latter would be greater propor tionally than that of the former if ships were built in the proper form to secure a high velocity But what is the fact On an average of sixteen freshwater fish delineated in Ianiell I find that the extreme length inclusive of the tailfin is four and twenty two hundredths times that of the extreme depth ex clusive of the dorsal and ventral fins The average breadth will be perhaps onehalf of the depth mak ing the proportion to length about 1 8 Abstract of a paper by Dr J P JOULE published in the Pro ceedings of the Manchester literary and philosophical society N VCE VOL V No 106 On an average of three species of whale the nar whal Greenland shark dolphin and the porpoise I find from Scoresby and other authorities the propor tion of either depth or breadth to length to be about 147 they having nearly circular sections There fore it appears that while in ships the proportion of length to width of midship immersion is 51 that of the shark the porpoise or dolphin is not more than 151 Dr Scoresby in his Arctic regions gives twelve miles per hour as the utmost speed of the whale but Mr Baxendell gives it a velocity approaching twenty miles I had an opportunity of witnessing the wonderful swimmingpowers of the porpoise dur ing a voyage to the Clyde in the Owl steamer on the 29th of June last About eight AM the sea being calm near the Mull of Galloway we were beset by a shoal of these animals which raced with the ship and kept alongside for three or four minutes with the greatest ease They swam in twos and threes at a foot or two distant from one another several ap proaching within ten feet of the vessel which was steaming at thle rate of thirteen and fourtenths statute miles per hour If such a velocity can be maintained by the porpoise with its comparatively bluff figurehead we may surely expect a much higher velocity in the case of fish more obviously designed for speed My son tells me that in a voyage of the Malvina from Leith to London he had observed at night two fishes of about a yard long which kept for a consider able time in advance of the cutwater of the ship be ing visible by their phosphorescent light The ship was at the time steaming at the rate of fifteen and twotenths statute miles per hour The investigation of the resistance of solids mov ing in fluids has been taken up theoretically by Thomson Stokes Rankine and practically by Froude who has found that the surface friction in long iron ships is more than fiftyeight per cent of the whole Froude recognized the study of the forms of animal life in guiding us to practical conclusions From the above considerations I am inclined to believe that a length of not more than five to one of breadth would be better than the extreme proportions of ships now in vogue and that the greatest breadth should be considerably in advance of the midship RECENT TRAVELS IN ARABIA FoiOM the recently printed account of Mr Charles Hubers mission in Arabia we cull some notes of gen eral interest On an excursion to the great mountain Jebel Aga the party camped at the entrance of the Tuarin val ley near the ruins of the little fortress El Asfar Three palms grow here and there is a little spring whose temperature 75 F indicates the heat of the soil and rock in this arid region Around the ruins were traces of cultivation and abandoned wells At a short distance the traveller was fortunate enough IFEBRUARY 13 1885 SCIE to make the second known discovery of Himiarite inscriptions of which there were nine These were on a block of granite of enormous size under whose shade travellers have refreshed themselves for many centuries as these inscriptions supposed to be more than two thousand years old sufficiently indicate They are accompanied by rude outlines of horsemen brandishing the sword and lance precisely similar to sketcles made in Hubers notebook by a living Arab chief at Hail It is probable that the first Himiarites established themselves in the Tuarin valley on their southward migration In the numerous revolutions which have devastated Arabia it is probable that the valley has been many times depopulated Farther on the party pased a singular rock which in falling from the crag had perched itself on a gran ite mass by three sharp points Being somewhat concave below it resounds like a ratller heavy bell to the strokes of a cane an infallible sign according to the Arabs of concealed treasures Their camp a few miles beyond was in the midst of a remarkable ravine of a uniform width of about fifteen hundred feet bordered by granite walls about iine hundred feet in height presenting in the sun remarkable hues of red violet brown and rose The perfectly level sandy soil was of a peculiar rose color and the im pression conveyed was of a gigantic street newly swept and silent Access to the Gou valley was ob tained through a very narrow ravine encumbered with fallen blocks hardly affording passage for a camel Above this it enlarges into a circular plateau continued on the other side by a long boulevard of magnificent palms The spot seemed a terrestrial paradise Flocks of birds so rare in this parched land delighted the eye and their songs broke the silence of the desert in a delightful manner Vegetation was luxuriant and beautiful and a flowing spring re freshed the party though its temperature was not less than 82 F In travelling about the Jebel Aga ascent was found practicable only in a very few places The walls rise abruptly without foothills and are of a gray red or reddishbrown granite of coarse grain composed of quartz with large crystals of red and white felspar with grains of pegmatite The dip of the beds is about 550 toward the horizon The wind in this part of Arabia blows always from the west The road passing through the region of Jebel Selma at no great distance from the Jebel Aga traverses an isolated volcanic district where the pas sage is often only wide enough for single file Several craters one twentyfive hundred feet across still re main and though now safe for travellers were for merly the fastnesses of Arab robbers whose attacks made the region deserve even more than its natural character its Arabian name of Gehenna Beyond just where the grits replace the basaltic rocks lies the little town of Feyd containing some forty houses Anciently this was a site of renown for whose de termination Iitter vainly spent many pages of dis cussion but its splendor has departed Around it at no great distance are scattered low hills of vol canic origin in some of which the craters are still NCE 135 evident Water lies under a bed of basalt very hard and six or seven feet thick covered with about thirty feet of sand and gravel The wells singularly enough are connected by subterranean tunnels This water accessible only at the cost of so much labor must be raised to water the palmtrees and is reported to be gradually diminishing to which the decay of the ancient city is probably due The des ert around Feyd is called AbaelKrus Thence toward El Kehafah the path traverses a re gion of volcanic rock which emerges from the sur face on either hand in a singular manner It looks as if the whole region had been once a boiling liquid lava which had been suddenly congealed leaving solidified bubbles twentyfive to thirtyfive feet in diameter which appear at every step A little sand is found here and there in crevices with an occasional shrub growing in it but apart from this the desert is absolutely naked rock of indescribable desolation  a corner of the real Arabia Petraea The name of this waste is El Sarafah In this region according to the Arabs there are some ten rainy days at the beginning of winter the rest of the year is literally dry Beyond KIehafah several small oases were seen of a singular geological structure which is however common in the region They consist of elliptical dishlike depressions dipping slightly toward the north their axes northwest and southeast and about twentyfour kilometres in length by half as nmuch in width The margins of these basins are abruptly elevated rocky walls about thirty or forty feet in height The wells pass through twelve or fifteen feet of gravel and rock beneath which is water in abundance but too bitter to be potable Drinking water is accessible in but two or three places The road from Kehafah to Ayoun passes the boundary of the safe country and enters the region of robber no mads A singular rock much resembling the sphinx in form partly covered with illegible Himiarite and Arabic inscriptions lies isolated near the route and beyond a much smaller one from which a few in scriptions could be transcribed The inhabitants of this region are small shrivelled and sicklylooking in strong contrast with the fine physique of the people of El Jebel which the traveller had left They are violent fanatics from whom his safe return was fortunate The mean temperature of the soil here was 84 and during one day with a hot wind the thermometer rose to 122 F in the shade STEAM ON STREETRAILWAYS THE Honi R C Parsons recently read a paper before the British institution of civil engineers in which the progress of steamlocomotion on street railways was very fully considered It was asserted that very little success had attended the efforts made to introduce steam as a motor on the common high way while the privileges accorded by special legis lation to the streetrailway companies have led to comparatively great success in that direction The British Board of trade regulations have

J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1076315,THE PROBLEM FROM THE STANDPOINT OF GENERAL LINGUISTICS,I244639,GRAMMATICAL NOMENCLATURE IN LANGUAGESTUDY 617 THE PROBLEM FROM THE STANDPOINT OF GENERAL LINGUISTICS C L MEADER THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AS ONE WHO HAS HAD EXPERIENCE IN TEACHING BOTH ANCIENT AND MODERN LANGUAGES I FEEL KEENLY THE EVILS OF OUR PRESENT PRACTICE IF WE ARE AGREED UPON ABANDONING LOGICAL AND METAPHYSICAL GRAMMAR THEN IT IS OUR FIRST DUTY TO SEEK PSYCHOLOGICAL CATEGORIES AS THE BASIS OF OUR NOMENCLATURE IN THIS MATTER WE SHOULD DO WELL TO FOLLOW UP THE SUGGESTIONS AND ADOPT SOME OF THE METHODS OF THE PSYCHOLOGISTS FOR MANY YEARS THEY HAVE TALKED MORE OR LESS ABOUT TYPES IN THE SENSE OF PSYCHICAL STRUCTURES IF ONE MAY USE THE TERM BUILT UP IN THE MIND IN THE COURSE OF OUR DAILY EXPERIENCES BY A PROCESS OF INVOLUNTARY ABSTRACTION THE TYPE MAY BE DE SCRIBED AS CONSISTING OF A RELATIVELY PERMANENT CORE OR CENTER OF CRYSTALLIZA TION WITH VARIOUS LINES OF ASSOCIATION RUNNING OUT FROM IT AND CONNECTING WITH INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCES PSYCHOLOGISTS HAVE DEFINED SUCH TYPES OF CON CRETE OBJECTS STANDARDS OF COMPARISON IN REFERENCE TO WEIGHTS AND MEASURES AND COLOR APPRECIATIONS IT REMAINS FOR STUDENTS OF LANGUAGE TO GO FARTHER AND TO IDENTIFY AND DESCRIBE SIMILAR TYPES COVERING THE RELATIONSHIPS AND OTHER IDEAS THAT MAKE UP SYNTAX THAT SUCH CATEGORIES HAVE NOT AS YET BEEN FOUND AND ACCURATELY DEFINED IS PLAIN TO TAKE A SINGLE ILLUSTRATION FROM THE CONFLICTING OPINIONS CURRENT CONCERNING THE FORCE OR FORCES OF THE SUBJUNCTIVE MOOD IF A SERIES OF SUCH TYPES SHOULD BE DISCOVERED AND DEFINED AND SHOWN TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN WORDS OR WORDFORMS THEY SHOULD FORM A THOROUGHLY SOUND FOUNDATION FOR A SYSTEM OF NOMENCLATURE APPROPRIATE AT LEAST TO THE LANGUAGE FROM THE STUDY OF WHICH THEY WERE DERIVED WE SHOULD APPROACH THIS PROBLEM FIRST AND FOREMOST AS IT SEEMS TO ME BY THE METHOD OF INTROSPECTION THE MATERIAL WITH WHICH WE WORK SHOULD BE PRIMARILY CONTEMPORARY EXPERIENCE IN NORMAL CONVERSATION IN OUR OWN VERNACULAR INTROSPECTION OF ONES EXPERIENCES IN READING HAS SECONDARY VALUE AND STILL LESS CONFIDENCE IS TO BE PLACED IN RESULTS DERIVED FROM THE STUDY OF FOREIGN LANGUAGES IN ADDITION TO OUR NEGLECT OF THE METHOD OF INTROSPECTION APPLIED AS ABOVE SUGGESTED WE HAVE ERRED BY LAYING TOO GREAT EMPHASIS ON THE ANALYTIC SIDE OF OUR WORK AND THUS NEGLECTING THE SYNTHETIC SIDE WE HAVE NOT ONLY BEEN PRONE TO SEPARATE A GIVEN FORM TOO COMPLETELY FROM ITS CONTEXT BUT HAVE ALSO BEEN INCLINED TO OVERLOOK THE COMPOSITE CHARACTER OF THE IDEA SYM BOLIZED BY A GIVEN FORM OR SET OF FORMS ALTHOUGH I RECOGNIZE THE SCIENTIFIC AND PEDAGOGICAL VALUE OF ACCURATETHE SCHOOL REVIEW SCIENTIFIC TERMS I HAVE USUALLY BEEN BETTER SATISFIED WITH THE STUDENT WHO COULD DESCRIBE A FUNCTION THAN WITH ONE WHO COULD MERELY NAME IT WHAT WE LOSE IN TIME WE GAIN IN CLEARNESS THE PROBLEM FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE ROMANCE LANGUAGES FRENCH A F KUERSTEINER INDIANA UNIVERSITY IN ADOPTING A UNIFORM GRAMMATICAL TERMINOLOGY THE NEEDS OF THOSE WHO MAKE USE OF THE TEXTBOOKS OUGHT TO BE CONISIDERED FIRST SERIOUS STUDENTS OF SYNTAX AS A RULE HAVE LITTLE TROUBLE IN UNDERSTANDING EACH OTHER EVEN THOUGH THEY EMPLOY DIFFERENT TERMS BUT SCHOOL CHILDREN ARE EASILY BEWILDERED AND SINCE THIS MOVEMENT IS TO BE ESPECIALLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF HIGHSCHOOL PUPILS I AM HEARTILY IN FAVOR OF IT BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO CALL ATTENTION TO WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE A SERIOUS DANGER A SCHOLAR INTERESTED IN SYNTAX IS ANXIOUS OF COURSE TO REACH GENERALIZA TIONS THAT MAY BE AS BROAD AS POSSIBLE NOW THE BROADER A GENERALIZATION THE MORE DIFFICULT IT IS TO UNDERSTAND THUS PROFESSOR HALE MAY BE RIGHT IN CLASSIFYING THE SUBJUNCTIVE AFTER VERBS OF FEARING AS HE DOES BUT IT IS EX TREMELY DOUBTFUL WHETHER A HIGHSCHOOL PUPIL COULD GRASP HIS CLASSIFICATION BESIDES THE OBJECT OF A HIGHSCHOOL TEXTBOOK IS NOT TO TEACH THE SYNTAX OF LATIN OR OF FRENCH OR OF ANY OTHER LANGUAGE BUT TO TEACH THE LANGUAGE ITSELF IT IS OF LITTLE ADVANTAGE TO A HIGHSCHOOL PUPIL TO CLASSIFY ALL THE SUBJUNCTIVES HE FINDS UNDER LET US SAY FOUR HEADS IT IS IMPORTANT HOWEVER THAT HE SHOULD SEE SOME REASON WHY A VERB IS IN THE SUBJUNCTIVE PERHAPS IT IS BECAUSE IT EXPRESSES PURPOSE OR RESULT OR BECAUSE IT FOLLOWS A VERB OF FEARING OR A VERB OF COMMANDING OR BECAUSE THE CLAUSE IN WHICH IT OCCURS IS CONCESSIVE OR AN INDIRECT QUESTION THESE ARE GENERALIZATIONS THAT A CHILD CAN BE BROUGHT TO UNDERSTAND JUST WHERE THE LINE BETWEEN THE BROADER AND NARROWER GENERALIZATIONS SHOULD BE DRAWN IS DIFFICULT TO DECIDE BUT IT IS BETTER TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF NARROW GENERALIZATIONS THAN ON THE OTHER SIDE THE DESIRE ON THE PART OF TEACHERS AND TEXTBOOKMAKERS TO MAKE INSTRUCTION IN LATIN AN EXERCISE IN CLASSIFICATION HAS BEEN THE BANE OF OUR HIGHSCHOOL WORK IT HAS ALSO BEEN AND IS THE REFUGE OF THE TEACHER WHO DOES NOT KNOW ENOUGH OF THE LANGUAGE TO LEAD PUPILS ON TO A READY UNDERSTANDING OF THE FOREIGN TEXT OF COURSE THE HARDER THE GENERALIZATION IS FOR THE PUPIL THE MORE TIME THE INCOMPETENT TEACHER CAN DEVOTE TO IT A MULTIPLICITY OF SMALL GENERALIZATIONS IS BETTER THAN A FEW BROAD ONES AGAIN IT IS DIFFICULT TO DECIDE JUST WHAT NUMBER OF GENERALIZATIONS IS DE 6I8

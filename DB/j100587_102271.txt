concerning a Method of Discover ing the true Moment of the Suns Ingress into the Tropical Signs By E Halley IT may perhaps pass for a Paradox if not seem ex travagant if I should assert that it is an easier mat ter to be assured of the moments of the Tropicks or of the times of the Suns entrance into Cancer and Ca pricorn than it is to observe the true times of the Equi noctials or Ingress into Aries and Libra I know the Opinion both of Ancient and Modern Astronomers to the contrary Ptolemy says expresly       And Ricciolus begins his Chap ter of the Solstitial Observations with these words Me rito Snelliusin notis ad observationes Hassiacas pronuncia vit Herculei esse laboris vitare in Solstitiis observandis errorem quadrantis diei and this because of the exceed ing slowness of the change of the Suns Declination on the day of the Tropick being not a quarter of a Minute in 24 Hours This indeed would make it very diffi cult nor would any Instruments suffice to do it were the moment of the Tropick to be determined from one single Observation But by three subsequent Observa tions made near the Tropickat proper intervals of time I hereby design to shew a Method to find the moment of the Tropicks capable of all the exactness the most Accurate can desire and that without any consideration of the Parallax of the Sun of the Refractions of the Air of the greatest Obliquity of the Ecliptick or La titude of the Place All which are required to ascertain the times of the Equinoctials from Observation and which being faultily assumed have occasioned an Error of near three Hours in the times of the Equinoctials de duced from the Tables of the Noble Tycho Brahe and Kepler13 Kepler the Vernal being so much later and the Autum nial so much earlier than by the Calculus of those Fa mous Authors Now before we proceed it will be necessary to pre mise the following Lemmata serving to demonstrate this Method viz 1 That the motion of the Sun in the Ecliptickabout the time of the Tropicks is so nearly equable that the difference from equality is not sensiblefrom five days be fore the Tropick to five days after and the difference arising from the little inequality that there is never amounts to above 14 of a single Second in the Declina tion and this by reason of the nearness of the Apogaeon of the Sun to the Tropick of Cancer 2 That for five Degrees before and after the Tro picks the differences whereby the Sun falls short of the Tropicks are as the Versed Sines of the Suns distance in Longitude from the  which Versed Sines in Arches under five Degrees are beyond the utmost ni cety of sense as the Squares of those Arches From these two follow a Third 3 That for five days before and after the Tropicks the Declination of the Sun falls short of the utmost Tro pical Declination by Spaces which are in duplicate pro portion or as the Squares of the Times by which the Sun is wanting of or past the moment of the Tropick Hence it is evident that if the Shadows of the Sun either in the Meridian or any other Azimuthbe carefully observed about the time of the Tropicks the Spaces whereby the Tropical shade falls short of or exceeds those at other times are always proportionable to the Squares of the Intervals of Time between those Obser vations and the true time of the Tropick and conse quently if the Line on which the Limits of the shade is taken be made the Axis and the correspondent times from the Tropick expounded by Lines be erected on D their14 their respective Points in the Axis as ordinates the ex tremities of those Lines shall touch the Curve of a Pa rabola as may be seen in the Figure Where a b c e being supposed Points observed the Lines aB bC cA eF are respectively proportional to the times of each Observation before or after the Tropical Moment in Cancer This premised we shall be able to bring the Problem of finding the true time of the Tropick by three Ob servations to this Geometrical one having three Points in a Parabola ABC or AFC given together with the direction of the Axis to find the Distance of those Points from the Axis Of this there are two cases the one when the time of the second Observation B is pre cisely in the middle time between A and C In this case putting t for the whole time between A and C we shall have A c the interval of the remotest Observation A from the Tropick by the following Analogy As 2acbc to 2ac12bc So is 12 t or AEto A c the time of the remotest Observation A from the Tro pick But the other case when the middle Observation is not exactly in the middle between the other two times as at F is something more operose and the whole time from A to C being puttand from A to Fs cec and bcbthe Theorem will stand thus ttcbss2tc2bsAc the time sought To illustrate this Method of Calculation it may per haps be requisite to give an Example or two for the sake of those Astronomers that are less instructed in the Geo metrical part of their Art Anno 1500 BernardWalther in the Month of June at Nuremburg observed the Chord of the distance of the Sun from the Zenith by a large Parallactick Instrument of Ptolemy as follows June15 inferredJuneinferred 2 45467 June 8 44975 June 9 44934 and June 12 44883 June 16 44990 June 16 44990 In both which cases the middle time is exactly in the middle between the extreams and therefore in the for mer three ac533 bc477 and t the time be tween being 14 days by the first Rule the time of the Tropick will be found by this Proportion as 589 to 827 12 So 12 t or 7 days to 9 days 20h 2 whence the Tropick inferredAnnoinferred 1500 is concluded to have fallen June 11d 20h 2 In the latter three ac is107 and bc15 and the whole interval of Time is 8 daysto twhence as 199 to 206 12 so is 4 days to 4d 3h 37 which ta ken from the 16th day at Noon leaves 11d 20h 23 for the time of the Tropick agreeing with the former to the third part of an hour Again Anno 1636 Gassendus at Marseilles observed the Summer Solstice by a Gnomon of 55 Foot high in order to determine the Proportion of the Gnomon to the Solstitial shade and he hath left us these Observations which may serve as an Example for the second Rule June 19 St N shadow 31766 parts whereof the Gnomon June 20 31753 was 89428 June 21 31751 June 22 31759 These being divided into two setts of three Observa tions each viz the 19th 20th and 22th and the 19th 21th and 22th we shall have in the first three c13 and b7t3 days s1 and in the second c15 and b7 t3 and s2 Whence according to the Rule the 19th day at Noon the Sun wanted of the Tro pick a time proportionate to one day as ttcssb to 2tc2bs that is as 110 to 64 in the first sett or D 2 10716 107 to 62 in the second set that is 1d 17h 15 in the first or 1d 17h 25 in the second sett So that we may conclude the Moment of the Tropick to have been June 10d 17h 20 in the Meridian of Marseilles Now that these two Tropical times thus obtained will be found to confirm each others exactness from their near agreement appears by the interval of time be tween them viz 1d 2h 30 less than 136 Julian years whereof 1d 1h 8 arises from the defect of the length of the Tropical Year from the Julian and the rest from the Progression of the Suns Apogaeon in that time so that no two Observations made by the same Observer in the same place can better answer each other and that without any the least Artifice or Force in the manage ment of them What were the Methods used by the Ancients to con clude the hour of the Tropicks Ptolemy has no where delivered but it were to have been wished that they had been aware of this that so we might have been more certain of the moments of the Tropicks we have received from them which would have been of singular use to determine the Question Whether the Suns Apo gaeon be fixt in the Starry Heaven or if it move what is the true motion thereof It is certainthat if we take the Account of Ptolemy the Tropick said to be obser ved by Euctemon and Meton Junii 27 mane Anno 432 ante Christum can no ways be reconciled without sup posing the Observation made the next day or June 28th in the Morning And Ptolemys own Tropick obser ved in the Third Year of Antoninus Anno Christi 140 was certainly on the 23th and not the 24th day of June as will appear to those that shall duly consider and compare them with the length of the Year dedu ced from the diligent and concordant Observations of ced two great Astronomical Genii Hipparchus and Al batani established and confirmed by the concurrence of17 of all the Modern Accuracy For these Observations give the length of the Tropical Year such as to antici pate the Julian Account only one day in 300 Years but we are now secure that the said Period of the Suns Revolution does anticipate very nearly three days in 400 Years so that the Tables of Ptolemy founded on that Supposition do err about a whole day in the Suns Place for every 240 Years Which principal Error in so Fundamental a Point does vitiate the whole Super structure of the Almagest and serves to convict its Au thor of want of Diligence or Fidelity or both But to return to our Method the great Advantage we have hereby is that any very high Building serves for an Instrument or the top of any high Tower or Steeple or even any high Wall whatsoever that may be sufficient to intercept the Sun and cast a true shade Nor is the Position of the Plane on which you take the shade or that of the Line therein on which you mea sure the Recess of the Sun from the Tropick very ma terial but in what way soever you discover it the said Recess will be always in the same Proportion by rea son of the smallness of the Angle which is not six Mi nutes in the first five days Nor need you enquire the height or distance of your Building provided it be ve ry great so as to make the Spaces you measure large and fair But it is convenient that the Plane on which you take the shade be not far from Perpendicular to the Sun at least not very Oblique and that the Wall which casts the shade be straight and smooth at top and its Direction nearly East and West for Reasons that will be well understood by a Reader skilful in the Doctrine of the Sphere And it will be requisite to take the Ex tream greatest or least deviation of the shadow of the Wall because the shade continues for a good time at a stand without alteration which will give the Obser ver leisure to be assured of what he does and not be inferredsurprizedinferred18 surprized by the quick transient motion of the shade of a single Point at such a distance The Principal Obje ction is that the Penumbra or Partile shade of the Sun is in its extreams very difficult to distinguish from the true shade which will render this Observation hard to determine nicely But if the Sun be transmitted through a Telescope after the manner used to take his Species in a Solar Eclipse and the upper half of the Objectglass be cut off by a Paper pasted thereon and the exact up per Limb of the Sun be seen just Emerging out of or rather continging the Species of the Wall the Posi tion of the Telescope being regulated by a fine Hair ex tended in the Focus of the Eyeglass I am assured that the limit of the shade may be obtained to the utmost exactness And of this I design to give a Specimen by an Observation to be made in June next by the help of the High Wall of St Pauls Church London of which some following Transaction may give an Account In the mean time what I have premised may suffice to set others at work where such or higher Buildings are to be met with I shall only Advertise that the Winter Tropick by this Method may be more certainly obtained than the Summers by reason that the same Gnomon does afford a much larger Radius for this manner of Obser vation III An

AND CORRESPONDENCE A REMARKABLE ECLIPSE TO THE EDITOR OF SCIENCE Eclipses of the sun and moon occur with such frequency and are so similar in character and appearance that a distinction between them sufficiently great to be noticed by the uncritical observer would seem to be out of the question The cause of eclipses is well known and as they may be easily calculated the times of their occurrence and nature of their appearance are always pub lished in the Nautical Almanac two or three years before they actually take place Total eclipses of the sun have for many years afforded the necessary darkness for observing the heav ens in close proximity to the sun and numer ous expeditions have been sent to distant parts of the earth in order to take advantage of the few moments of additional darkness thus afforded and much interesting and useful information concerning the physical constitu tion of the sun has been obtained in this man ner At the present time however the chief importance of eclipses lies in the opportunities they afford for testing the accuracy of the cal culations of mathematicians and the correct ness of the physical theories on which such calculations are based and for this purpose the distinction between partial and total eclipses is of little importance In the year 1915 there were only two eclipses both of the sun The first occurred on Feb ruary 13 under ordinary circumstances the central eclipse began at sunrise in the Indian Ocean a few degrees to the southward of the island of Madagascar passing along the north western coast of Australia it crossed the island of New Guinea and ended at sunset in the North Pacific Ocean The second eclipse took place on August 10 beginning at sunrise a few degrees to the southward of the Japanese Islands in the North Pacific Ocean It moved to the eastward a few degrees southward of the Sandwich Islands at noon and ended at sun set in the South Pacific Ocean These two eclipses were very similar in character in so far as outward appearances are concerned Their relative importance arises from the very dissimilar conditions under which they took place In the eclipse of August 10 the centers of the sun moon and earth were very nearly in the same straight line I have ex amined the record of all the eclipses that have taken place since the year 1767 and I find that in the year 1903 there were two very sim ilar eclipses one of which took place on Feb ruary 21 and the other on August 17 of that year It has therefore been one hundred and twelve years since a similar eclipse happened and I find that the next similar eclipse will occur on July 11 1991 or seventysix years from the present time It is therefore only on very rare occasions that such eclipses take place and this fact seems worthy of mention in the his torical record of important eclipses It may however interest the reader to know how or why I happened to make this important discovery as it has been many years since I was engaged in the discussion of eclipses for chronological purposes I will therefore give a brief account of my investigations which so happily led to this discovery In the early summer of the year 1906 I was much embarrassed by a superfluity of leisure and unable to pass my time agreeably with nothing to do I had then recently been read ing G H Darwins interesting book on  The Tides and Kindred Phenomena and learned that the mathematical theory of the tides was in a very unsatisfactory condition I had read in my younger days the explanations of the tides by Newton and by Laplace These ex planations seemed so plausible that I then ac cepted them as correct But as I had devoted the greater part of my life to the discussion of gravitational problems the thought occurred to me that possibly a new discussion of an old problem might throw additional light upon a subject which was confessedly very obscure I therefore concluded to undertake a critical discussion of the theory of the tides and the discovery of the remarkable eclipse came as a biproduct of that discussion My leisure has 830 SCIENCEDECEMBER 10 1915 since been pleasantly devoted to a study of the tides and other kindred problems In my investigation of the tidal problems I have based my work on the two following postulates namely FIRST If a solid body of any figure what ever be covered by a fluid in equilibrium the gravity at every point of the surface will be the same and SECOND If the fluid covering a solid body be free to flow and the gravity at different points of its surface be disturbed in any man ner whatever the fluid will flow from points where gravity is less to points where gravity is greater and it will continue to flow until the gravity at all points of the surface becomes equal If these postulates in regard to the equilib rium of fluids be correct the problem of the tides becomes greatly simplified and instead of being the most difficult it becomes the simplest problem of celestial mechanics For it is a very simple problem to calculate just how much the earths gravity at any point of its surface is affected by the attraction of the sun and moon Now when the sun or moon is overhead we know the gravity at the earths surface directly underneath them is lessened and we also know that the gravity at all points where the sun or moon is in the horizon is in creased by their attraction It therefore fol lows from the second postulate that the water directly under the sun or moon will flow away towards the horizon in every direction and in stead of being heaped up under the moon as claimed by Newton and his successors will be dispersed along a great circle of the earth whose pole is directly under the sun or moon thus making a thin ribbon or narrow zone of high water of uniform depth and extending completely around the earth instead of being piled up in the form of protuberance under the moon It also follows that there will be a zone of low water directly under the moon instead of a protuberance of high water as claimed by Newton Now since there are two disturbing bodies the sun and the moon acting independently of each other it is evident that there will be two independent highwater waves passing com pletely around a great circle of the earth and since all great circles intersect or cross each other at opposite extremities of a diameter it follows that there will always be two points of intersection or two places of high water which may be observed at all times provided we know where to look for them It also follows that high tides are not restricted to the times of new and full moon but exist at all times The problem of the tides is therefore greatly simplified and reduced to one of finding where the highwater waves produced by the attrac tion of the sun and moon cross each other for at these points the single wave is equal to the sum of the two separate waves and the com putation of the places where the tidal waves cross each other is very easy and much simpler than the computation of an eclipse The plane of the solar tidal wave is always perpendicular to the ecliptic and passes through the center of the earth and poles of the ecliptic and its position is known at all times The plane of the lunar tidal wave is always perpendicular to the plane of the moons orbit but as the moons orbit is inclined to the ecliptic by about 5 it follows that the poles of the moons orbit are always at a distance of 5 from the poles of the ecliptic But the inclina tion of the moons orbit to the ecliptic is always the same while the nodes of the orbit on the ecliptic are in motion and perform a complete revolution in about nineteen years It follows from this that the poles of the moons orbit move in a small circle of 5 radius around the poles of the ecliptic making a revolution in nineteen years The position of the lunar tidal wave thus becomes known at all times and since the position of the solar tidal wave is also known at the same time it becomes an easy matter to calculate the place of their in tersection which is the place of high tide Now since the moons nodes are moving backward on the ecliptic 15649 during each lunation it follows that the tides of no two consecutive lunations will be precisely the same but they may be more easily calculated than most other celestial phenomena SCIENCE 831N S VOL XII No 1093 In the early spring of the present year 1915 I had so far completed the construction of mathematical formulas for the computation of the tides that I actually computed the lati tude at which the two tidal waves crossed each other at noon of each day during the lunation between May 13 and June 13 This calcula tion led to the discovery that whatever may be the relative declinations of the sun and moon at the moment of conjunction or oppo sition in right ascension the two tidal waves will always cross each other exactly at the equator and at the distance of 90 both east and west from the meridian on which the sun and moon are situated During this lunation the two tidal waves crossed each other at an angle which varied between 4 20 and 90 and the latitudes at which they crossed each other were less than 40 during about three days at the times of new and full moon while during the twentysix or twentyseven remaining days of the lunation the high water was confined within the latitude of 45 and 70 making a typical highwater zone of about 25 in breadth Now it will be remembered by readers who are familiar with tidal history that both New ton and Laplace were greatly embarrassed by the fact that the highest tides did not occur at the time when the acting forces were the greatest but about a day and a half later and in order to explain this default of theory they were obliged to assume the operation of fictitious or imaginary causes The observa tions on which their theories were based were made in southern England or northern France in latitudes in which the united tidal wave did not usually reach until about a day and a half after the time of new or full moon and the reason it was not observed was not on account of its nonexistence but because it was on duty in another place We shall now consider the united tidal wave during the lunation beginning with the full moon of July and ending with that of August According to the data given in the American Ephemeris the two tidal waves at the instant of conjunction on August 10 made an angle with each other amounting to only 438 so that they were practically superposed the one upon the other throughout their whole extent and reaching entirely around the earth But as the lunar tidal wave travels over the earths surface about thirteen times as fast as the solar tidal wave they soon part company near the equator each wave revolving around its own polar axis and at the end of a single day the latitude of the united tidal wave will be found at 61 40 and the two tidal waves will cross each other at an angle of about 11 20 The united tidal wave will then remain on or very near to the parallel of 62 of latitude until near the end of the lunation and there would be a daily succession of uniformly high tides on that parallel of latitude during nearly a whole month We have thus far considered only that por tion of the tidal waves which rises above the normal surface of the ocean but the water can not rise at any given place on the earths sur face without an equivalent depression at some other point and a correct theory of the tides will explain equally well all the conditions incident to their formation Now we know that the earths surfacegravity is diminished by the attraction of the sun and moon at all points of the surface that are less than 54 44 of angular distance from those bodies and in creased for all greater distances It therefore follows that all fluids that are under the sun and moon and are free to flow will flow away from the point directly under the sun or moon instead of towards it as required by the present accepted theory of the tides This fol lows for two reasons First because the earths gravity is greater in that direction and second because the tangential forces of the sun and moon actually push all bodies in that direction This is one of the most beau tiful and interesting consequences arising from the gravitation of matter for were the manner of its action to be reversed the earth would no longer be habitable by man or beast for the sun would be hidden by a perpetual cloud by day and the moon by night and neither of the luminaries would be visible ex cept at rare and uncertain intervals Sir John Herschel in his  Outlines of 832 SCIENCEDECEMBER 10 1915 SCIE Astronomy has called attention to the un explained fact that the full moon tends to disperse the clouds under it This follows as a necessary consequence of gravitation but it is not restricted to the full moon but is in active operation at all times by both sun and moon The fact is however most easily ob served at the time when the sun is absent Incidentally we may mention that were the moons orbit in the plane of the ecliptic the eclipse conditions of the tenth of August would be mostly repeated at each new moon but the tidal phenomena would be fundamentally dif ferent In the supposed case the crossing of the two tidal waves would be constantly at the pole of the ecliptic during the whole luna tion and the high tides would be confined to the latitudes of the arctic and antarctic circles If at the same time the earths equator were shifted into the ecliptic there would be a constant elevation of water at both poles of the earth while all other places on the surface of the earth would have four simple tidal waves each day The general problem of the height of the tidal wave at any time and place on the earths surface can not be considered here but tables for that purpose have already been computed though still unpublished We see from this exposition of the subject that all the infinite variety of tidal phenomena are fully explained by the operation of the forces of gravitation as developed under exist ing conditions in the solar system The eclipse of August 10 represents a case in which the forces of the sun and moon act in perfect harmony during a few minutes of time but it recurs at such infrequent and uncertain in tervals that nothing useful can be learned from a single performance unless there be some known theoretical connection with pre ceding and subsequent events The problem of the tides which has been aptly called the Riddle of the Ages and designated in de spair by an ancient philosopher as  the tomb of human curiosity may therefore now be considered as completely solved JOHN N STOCKWELL CLEVELAND November 4 1915 NCE 833 ON THE DEGREE OF EXACTNESS OF THE GAMMA FUNCTION NECESSARY IN CURVE FITTING1 THE note by Mr P F Everitt in a recent number of this journal2 discussing an earlier note by the present writer3 seems so likely to obscure the essential point and pur pose for which the earlier note was written that it appears desirable to advert to the sub ject once more In practical biometric work the gamma function is chiefly though of course not en tirely used in connection with the fitting of Pearsons skew frequency curves where such function appears in the expression for yo In other words the exactness of approximation to the gamma function in these cases can af fect nothing but the calculation of the ordi nates and areas of the fitted curve The writer finds it difficult to conceive of such circum stances in the ordinary prosecution of prac tical statistical researches as would necessi tate or warrant the calculation of the ordi nates or areas of a frequency curve to more than two places of decimals This being the case it seemed desirable in the earlier paper to call attention to the fact that a quite suffi ciently  exact approximation to the values of the gamma functions could be made by simple interpolation in a table of log I n In order that the statistical worker may form his own judgment as to what degree of exactness in approximating the gamma func tion is necessary in calculating yo Table I is presented This table shows for four differ ent skew frequency curves the change pro duced in yo by altering the logarithm of the term involving gamma functions by the fol lowing amounts 0000001 000001 00001 0001 and 001 The curves used for illustra tion are taken from Pearsons memoir  On the Mathematical Theory of Errors of Judg ment with Special Reference to the Personal Equation 4 The curve marked I in the table is Pear 1 Papers from the Biological Laboratory of the Maine Agricultural Experiment Station No 90 2 SCIENCE N S Vol XLII pp 453455 1915 3 SCIENCE N

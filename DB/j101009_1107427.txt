j101009,The Virginia Law Register,1107427,In the Law and Equity Court of the City of Richmond Director General of Railroads v E W Gates and Son Co May 26 1921,i246127,1921  DIRECTOR GENL OF RAILRDS V E W GATES  SON CO 253 IN THE LAW AND EQUITY COURT OIF THE CITY OF RICHMOND DIRECTOR GENERAL OF RAILROADS V E W GATES AND SON Co May 26 1921 1 CarriersDemurrageMoney Charge or PenaltyThe term de murrage may be used to designate a mere money charge for the use of a car or a penalty intended by its imposition to prevent any de tention of the car 2 PenaltiesLimitation of ActionThe duty to pay a penalty for the violation of a legal regulation is a legal obligation not contractual in its nature and the limitation applicable is one year The question involved was whether demurrage charges which increase as time passes constitute a contract or a penalty If the decision had been that it is a contract the limitation would have been three years if a penalty one year Munford Hunter Williams and Anderson for plaintiff R L Montague for defendant CRUMP J I have considered the interesting arguments sub mitted and the authorities cited in the matter of the plea of the statute of limitations in the case of John Barton Payne Di rectorGeneral etc v E W Gates  Son Co The authorities speak at times of demurrage as a mere deten tion charge for the use of the car in the nature of a warehouse or terminal charge and at other times as a penalty Consider ing the manner in which the term demurrage was imported into American railroad phraseology I thifik it may be and has been used to designate a mere money charge for the use of the car or to designate a penalty intended by its imposition to pre vent any detention of the car and to penalize the consignee if he does detain it according as it was intended as the one or the other I think it fairly manifest from all the circumstances here that the charge which the Southern railway was authorized to im pose in the present case was intended to prevent the detention of the car beyond free time and to impose upon the consignee quite a heavy pecuniary payment in case of violation by him of the rule requiring him to return the car at the end of the free time and was therefore a penalty Having reached this conclusion I feel constrained to follow the ruling of the West Virginia court in Gawthrop v Fairmount Coal Co 81 S E 560 and to hold that the period of limitation in bar of the claim made in this case is one year and not three years The duty to pay a penalty for violation of a legal regulation7 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S cannot be said to rest upon a contract express or implied The duty is in a general legal sense an obligation but it is an obli gation not contractural in its nature nor arising out of a con tract express or implied I have examined most of the authorities collated by the in dustry of counsel and may add WVestern Union Telegraph Com pany v Bilisoly 116 Va 562 and Myers v Exchange National Bank L R A N S 1918A 67 The issue on the plea of the statute of limitations should therefore be decided in favor of the defendant and judgment ordered accordingly Note In Gawthorp J Fairmont Coal Co 74 W Va 39 81 S E 560 cited in the principal case it was held that one year is the period of limitation as to an action for the penalty imposed by W Va Code 1913 sec 3920 for mining within five feet of a division line The court said We have no period particularly fixed for the bar of stat utory penalties as many jurisdictions have The question must be answered by our general provisions of limitation Resort must be had to the following Every personal action for which no limitation is otherwise prescribed shall be brought within five years next after the right td bring the same shall have accrued if it be for a matter of such nature that in case a party die it can be brought by or against his representative and if it be for a matter not of such nature shall be brought within one year next after the right to bring the same shall have accrued and not after Code 1913 ch 104 sec 12 Sec 4425 Now in the absence of express statutory provisions actions for the recovery of statutory penalties do not survive The death of either party plaintiff or defendant is an incurable abate ment 1 Cyc 67 A cause of action for Ithe recovery of a penalty does not survive the death of the wrongdoer being in its nature per sonal As to what is a penal action the rule is that where an action is founded entirely upon a statute and the only object of it is to re cover a penalty or forfeiture it is clearly a penal action 1 R C L 47 At common law actions on penal statutes do not survive Comys Digest title Administration B 15 Schreiber v Sharpless 110 U S 76 3 Sup Ct 423 28 L Ed 65 It has not been made other wise with us So by the statute which we have quoted above the matter of this penalty being of such a nature that an action on it does not survive one year is the limitation for an action thereon The plea was improperly rejected No definite consideration seems to have been given the point in Hall v Railroad Co 44 W Va 36 28 S E 754 41 L R A 669 67 Am St Rep 757 wherein it is asserted that five years is the limita tion for an action on the penalty there involved and the remark is a mistaken one 254  Aug

RE PBS c Pteceived November 15Read December 13 1866 THE principal triangulation of the United Kingdom was finished in 1851 and the tri angulations of France Belgium Prussia and Russia were so far advanced in 1860 that if connected we should have a continuous triangulation from the Island of Yalentia on the southwest extremity of Ireland in north latitude 51 55 2 0 and longitude 10 20 40 west of Greenwich to Orsk on the River Ural in Russia It was therefore possible to measure the length of an arc of parallel in latitude 520 of about 75 and to determine by the assistance of the electric telegraph the exact difference of longitude between the extremities of this arc and thus obtain a crucial test of the accuracy of the figure and dimensions of the earth as derived from the measure ment of arcs of meridian or the data for modifying the results previously arrived at The Russian Government therefore at the instance of M OTTO STRUVE Imperial Astronomer of Russia invited in 1860 the cooperation of the Governments of Prussia Belgium France and England to effect this most important object and to their great honour they all consented and granted the necessary funds for the execution of the work The portion of the work which was assigned to me was the connexion of the triangu lation of England with that of France and Belgium and I published the results of this operation in 1862 But this work has been done in duplicate for when application was made to the French Government to permit the necessary observations to be made in France they not only consented to allow this but at the same time volunteered to join in the labour and expense of the work itself It would obviously have been wrong to mix up observations made with different kinds of instruments and on different principles and therefore it was agreed that the work should in fact be made in duplicate both the French and English geometricians using the exact same stations The results obtained by the French geometricians is published in the Supplement to vol ix of the Memorial du Depot General de la Guerre 1865 and the agreement with the results obtained by the English is truly surprising But however accurately the trigonometrical observations might be performed it is Obvious that without a precise knowledge of the relative lengths of the standards used  Extension of the Triangulation of the

it would be impossible accurately to express the length of the arc of parallel in terms of any one of the standards It was therefore necessary that a comparison of the standards of length should be made and as we had a building and apparatus expressly erected for the purpose of comparing standards at this office the English Government on my recommendation invited the Governments of the several countries named to send their standards here and we have had the following compared with the greatest accuracy 1 Russian Standard double Toise P 2 Prussian Standard Toise 3 Belgian Standard Toise 4

numerous comparisons to be made entailed a great amount of labour upon him and his assistants Quartermaster STEEL and Corporal COIPTON of the oRoval Engineers Before the connexion of the triangulations of the several countries into one great neuworKl of triangles extending across the entire breadth of Europe and before the dis covery of the electric telegraph and its extension from Valentia to the Ural Mountains it was not possible to execute so v ast an undertaking as that which is now in progress It is in fact a work which could not possibly have been executed at Cany earlier period in the history of the world The exact determination of the figure and dimensions of the earth has been the great aim of astronomers for upwards of two thousand years and it is fortunate that we live in a time when men are so enlightened as to combine their labours to effect an object desired by all and at the first moment when it was possible to execute it A full detailed account of the

Standard Yard By Captain A R CLARKE 1RE PBS c In the Philosophical Transactions Part III 1857 is the Astronomer Royals  Ac count of the Construction of the New National Standard of Length and of its Principal Copies Those who have looked carefully into this paper must have perceived that the difficulties attending the comparisons of standards where results of a high order of precision are aimed at are considerable requiring the very best workmanship in nearly every part of the apparatus and demanding the greatest patience and circumspection on the part of the observer But the difficulties which were encountered and so success fully overcome by Mr SHEEPSHANKS are considerably enhanced when as in the opera tions which have been recently conducted at the Ordnance Survev Office Southampton the bars to be compared are of different and incommensurable lengths It was therefore foreseen that without building a room especially for the purpose and devising an appa ratus that could be adapted to the measurements of all kinds of lengths up to 13 or 14 feet the comparison of the geodetical standards with the yard could not be undertaken with any prospect of success The barroom is 20 feet in length by 11 in breadth the walls are double the outer 2 feet thick and the inner 4 inches with an interval of 3 inches The foundations are very strongly built The roof is flat the walls being spanned by iron girders whose lower flanges support large slates which again are covered uniformly by 9 inches of concrete The direction of the length of the room is nearly east and west in the north face are two small windows sufficient to admit a moderate amount of daylight The sash frames which slide in the interval between the two walls are further protected by wooden shutters 3 inches in thickness on the outside The doorway is at the east en d of the room and is closed by double doors one on the outside of the room the other on the inside so that any one entering the room may close the first or outer door before he opens the second or inner door An outer building encloses this room and so protects it from the variations of tempe rature of the external air The outer building is of brick and is 40 feet in length by 20 in breadth with an ordinary slate roof Thus shielded from external influences the temperature of the inner room is exceedingly steady leaving nothing to be desired in this respect Along the southern wall of the room are three stone piers for supporting the micro metermicroscopes The centre pier or block measures on its upper surface 4 feet by 16 inches the outer blocks are of the same breadth but only 3 feet 6 inches in length they are distant 5 feet from centre to centre from the middle block These stones are close to the wall of the room but are not actually in contact with it they have separate z2164 CAPTAIN A R CLARKE ON THE COMPARISON OF ENGLISH AND FOREIGN andl deep foundations of brickwork their upper surfaces are about 4 feet 6 inches above the floor of the room Each stone is so cut as to present along its front horizontal edge a projecting ledge the upper surface in fact projecting 3 inches beyond the lower part or face of the stone the vertical depth of the projecting ledge is 3 inches Immediately in front of and close to the piers is placed a large mahogany beam measuring 14 feet in length by 14 inches in breadth and 9 inches in vertical depth Its position is horizontal and parallel to the length of the room and to the faces of the stone piers to its upper surface which is about 2 feet above the floor of the room are fastened a pair of planed castiron rails 11 inches from centre to centre and extending the whole length of the beam In the fixing of these rails to the beam provision is made for any warping which the beam night undergo so that the rails can always be kept straight and parallel This beam being intended to support the standard bars when under the microscopes is not itself supported by the floor of the room but has like the stone piers its own foundations The flooring upon which the observer stands has no contact either with the stone piers or with the foundations by which the beam is supported Further the foundations for the beam are entirely disconnected with the stone piers thus and it has been repeatedly and severely tested no movement of the observer can disturb either the microscopes or the bars under observation Before perfect immunity from disturb ance however was obtained it was found necessary to disconnect the wooden flooring entirely from the walls of the room the flooring is framed in three separate pieces each being supported by or simply resting on four large blocks of indiarubber Vicromneter MicroscopesThe magnifying power of the microscopes is about sixty The length of the tube from the diaphragm to the objectglass is 12 inches and from the objectglass to its external focus 3 inches The value of one division of the micro meter is about the 35000th part of an inch Each microscope is held immediately in a strong hollow gunmetal cylinder about 6 inches in length the axis of which coincides with that of the microscope At either extremity this cylinder is internally provided with circular Ys into or against which the tube of the microscope is pushed by springs the tube having two strong accurately turned collars for this purpose at onefourth and threefourths of its length The upper collar has a flange which determines longitudi nally the position of the microscope with respect to the gunmetal cylinder while at the same time the microscope is free to revolve in the cylinder but without anything approaching to a shake From the cylinder at its mid length project three arms by which it is held and levelled each arm having through its extremity a cylindrical hole bored 4 inch diameter parallel to the cylinder itself This gunmetal cylinder again is supported by and held firmly to a strong and heavy plate of cast iron which having three bosses on its under surface rests on one of the stone piers part of the plate pro jecting beyond the front of the stone towards the room That part of the iron plate which rests immediately on the stone is a rectangle of 12 inches by 14 inches and the projectinlg part may be described as something like an equilateral triangle of 8 inchesGEODETICAL STANDARDS WITH THE ENGLISH STANDARD YARD 165 side the plate is rather more than an inch thick Towards the apex of the projecting triangle there is a circular hole 2 inches in diameter through the plate through which the gunmetal cylinder holding the microscope passes Equidistant from the centre of this hole and equidistant from one another are three vertical screws strongly bolted into the iron plate and projecting upwards about 2 inches in length These screws pass freely through the holes i i the arms of the gunmetal cylinder Suppose now 1two nuts run ning upon each of these screws one above and one below each of the arms and it is clear that we have the means of rendering truly vertical the axis of the microscope and also of holding the microscope very firm by clamping down the upper nuts It will also be seen that the microscope is held without the least strain and that it can be raised or lowered small quantities so as to bring to focus over a given object The iron plate is nSot held down to the stone in any way its own weight gives sufficient stability it may be shifted to any position on any of the stones IiltrninationMuch depends upon the proper illumination of the divided surfaces under observation A candle whose flame is mechanically kept in a constant position stands behind the microscopes and its light condensed by a lens 3 inches in diameter passes through an aperture in the projecting part of the castiron plate being brought to a focus on the divided surface under observation Abundance of light is thus obtained and the candle being above the bar the heated air is continually carried away from it besides the heat of a candle is the least practicable with a sufficiency of light CarriagesThe box containing the bar or bars under observation is supported by two carriages which run upon the rails that have been described as fixed on the upper surface of the large mahogany beam one of the rails is flat the other triangular in section each carriage runs on three wheels two of which being grooved run on the angular rail the third on the flat rail Thus it will be seen that the motion of the carriage is without any possible jamming Each of the two carriages is doublethat is consists of an upper and lower carriage the upper carriage runs upon short rails on the surface of the lower carriage and in a direction perpendicular to the motion of the latter A slowmotion screw affords the means of communicating when required a small motion to the upper carriage Without going into further details as to the construction of these carriages it may be sufficient to say that the different parts are so put together that no shake exists nor can it be introduced by wear The box containing the bar or bars under comparison has therefore when resting on the carriages a perfectly steady bearing while it can be moved in a longitudinal direction by the running of the carri ages along the rails on the mahogany beam or moved transversely by the movement of the upper carriages on the lower This method of illumination was decided on after a considerable number of experiments with gas oil lamps c directed and condensed or reflected in different ways Had there been only a few different lengths to compare the light might have been brought in from the outside of the room through horizontal holes in the wall and piers and in this manner some of the earlier comparisons on different tenfoot bars were made But this method could not have been applied to the comparisolls generally on account of the large number of holes that would have been required166 CAPTAIN A R CLARKE ON THE COMPARISON OF ENGLISH AND FOREIGN Suppose now we have two bars lying alongside one another in a box the boxes are of a uniform breadth of 8 inches externally their axes parallel and about as usual 3 inches apart then by the movement of the upper carriages the one bar and the other may be brought alternately under the microscopes BarsThe various copies of the standard yard are all 1 inch square in section and about 38 inches in length At about an inch from either extremity of the bar a cylin drical well is drilled halfway through the metal at the bottom of each well Is a gold pin let into the bar On the surfaces of these gold pins which are it will be observed in the neutral axis of the bar the lines defining the measure are drawn The bar has also wells in its upper surface for the bulbs of two or four thermometers That particular copy of the standard yard which has been compared with all the geodetical standards is No 55 Swedish Iron it is supported on rollers at onefourth and threefourths of

axis of the cylinder coinciding with that of the bar and the dia meter of the cylinder coinciding with the depth of the bar At the extremity of each of these cylinders is affixed a smaller coaxial cylinder of tempered steel an eighth of an inch in diameter and only a sixtieth of an inch long The faces of these small cylinders which are perfect planes beautifully polished and at right angles to the axis of the bar form the terminal planes of the measure Ru1ssian Dousle Toise P is also ani end measure but the terminal surfaces are 1iotGEODETICAL STANDARDS WITH THE ENGLISH STANDARD YARD 167 planes being slightly convex it is a bar of wrought iron two toises in length and an inch and a half square in section supported at onefourth and threefourths of its length Standard Foot F is a bar 13 inches long by 1 inch square divided into inches The extreme inches are further divided on inlaid strips of platinum into tenths and some of these tenths into hundredths ThermometersThe standard thermometers to which all others have been referred have had their errors determined by calibration measurement to every fifth degree by means of an apparatus constructed for this purpose The apparatus consists essentially of three parts1 as a base a heavy rectangular plate of metal 2 feet long lying hori zontally having at its extremities upright pieces 10 inches high 2 the top of these uprights are joined by a couple of steel rods parallel to one another and at the same height along these rods there slides a platform carrying a vertical microscope between the rods 3 a sliding frame supported immediately by the lower plate moving in the direction of the length of the lower plate or of the steel rod above carries the ther mometer to be examined This sliding frame is moved by means of a micrometer screw which therefore draws the thermometer along backwards or forwards in the direction of its own axis The bed of the thermometer is rendered truly horizontal and the micro scope has a level attached by means of which its axis may be always kept strictly vertical The thermometer is protected as far as possible from variations of temperature by being closely surrounded except its upper surface by metal and the detached column of mercury can be shifted from one position to another without touching the thermometer with the hand The error of the mean length of a degree is determined by boiling tbe thermometer in a horizontal position and immediately after placing it in ice The thermometers which record the temperatures of the bars are only 5 inches inE length each showing 20 range of temperature the degree is about a fifth of an inch in length and subdivided to tenths These thermometers are compared as often as necessary and this is very often with the standard thermometers The apparatus for the comparison of thermometers consists of a water trough 29 inches long by 9 inches broad and 9 inches deep internal measurement resting on three points one of which is a levellingscrew The thermnometers rest on cross bars at the mid depth of the water their tubes truly leveL This trough stands on the ground and the thermometers are read by means of a long microscope which is mounted on a travelling platform and Of which the axis is made vertical The degrees on the long standard thermometers arc not generally subdivided and in order to read them accurately the following arrangement was adopted on a small strip of plate glass are drawn a system of eleven equidistant and slightly converging lines this strip slides in the diaphragm of the microscope and can1 be moved by the hand then if it be required to subdivide a degree seen in the centre of the field of the microscope the glass slide is moved until the outer lines of the system coincide with the bounding lines of the degree Thus tenths are immediately read and the hundredths can be estimated In order to read the thermometers when lying in the biars orifices are provided in the168 CAPTAIN A R CLARKE ON THE COMPARISON OF ENGLISH AND FOREIGN covers of the boxes the microscopes used here are 12 inches in length they are mounted on sliding plates so as to traverse the whole length of the thermometertube the verti cality of their axes is also ensured Method of ConiopctringWhenever practicable the two bars which have to be com pared are mounted side by side in the same box Each bar is capable of being levelled by raising or lowering the cradles or rollers on which it rests or brought to focus under the microscopes Each microscope has attached to it a level whereby the verticality of the axis may be tested It is usual to arrange a pair of bars for comparison on the afternoon of one day and to commence observing the next day The bars are visited three or four times each day a series of comparisons has generally consisted of about ten visits or comparisons and the bars are then dismounted to be compared another time All adjustments are frequently put out and renewed there is little use in mul tiplying observations while none of the circumstances of the observations are changed Consequently as far as practicable the comparisons of any two bars have been made in detached series thus the fear of constant error is diminished It is generally assumed that the temperatures of two bars lying together in the box are the same the minute differences which are sometimes found in comparing the readings of the thermometers being attributed to the thermorneters themselves which certainly do not always imme diately indicate changes of two or three hundredths of a degree of temperature The two bars are also made to interchange places so that either one of them is next to the observer about as often as it is next to the piers A temporary constant error may also creep in if great care is not taken that the divided surfaces are clean minute particles of dust almost indiscernible to the eye or one such particle hanginog about the edges of the line where it is to be bisected will give a false result to all observations and it is of course undesirable to clean the surfaces or even rub them gently oftener thant can possibly be helped The observations made at any one visit to the barroom are generally as follows 1 the two thermometers in each bar are read 2 the bar A being adjusted to focus under the microscopes three readings bisections of the microscope on the left are taken and then three readings of the microscope on the right 3 B being now adjusted under the microscopes similar readings are made 4 B is thrown out of focus by the levellingscrews and being readjusted in focus under each microscope is observed as before 5 A is observed a second time 6 the thermometers are read again A slight disturbance and rise of temperature is almost inevitably caused by the observers presence and the heat of the two candles On the average the second readings of the thermometers are 0 035 above the first readings In comparing any two bars the greater part of the comparisons have been made at temperatures differing not more than 2 from the standard temperature of 620 and a small portion at a temperature as low as possible thus the expansions of the bars are eliminated With respect to personal error in bisections this has been found to exist in the caseGEODETICAL STANDARDS WITH THE ENGLISH STANDARD YARD 169 of some particular lines to the amount of one or sometimes two micrometer divisions The only way of eliminating personal error is by the employment of as many expert observers as can be commanded FlexureIt is of the utmost importance that a bar be supported invariably at the same points if these points be altered then unless the divided surfaces be in the neutral axis the length of the bar undergoes a change The proper positions for the supporting rollers of a bar have been investigated by Mr AIRy in the Memoirs of the Royal Astro nomical Society In order to test the theory of flexure of bars considered as elastic rods by actual experiment a large number of observations as to changes of length cor responding to change of supports were made on three iron bars specially prepared for the purpose Each bar was 40 inches long by an inch square It will suffice here to explain generally the process and give the results for one of the bars If a bar be sup ported by its extremities it is clear that the whole of its upper surface will be compressed while the lower surface will be correspondingly extended therefore the length of the bar as measured by the distance between two dots at the extremities of the upper surface will be less than if the neutral axis were straight in fact if i be the inclination of the bar at either extremity to the horizon and k the depth of the bar its curvature will cause the dots to approach each other by the quantity ik This effect of curvature will be greatly exaggerated if the dots be engraved not on the surface of the bar but on the tops of bits of strong wire inserted in a vertical position into the bar at its extremities if h be the length of either wire the approach of the dots to one another by the curva ture of the bar will be ik  2h Accordingly four such perpendiculars were erected on the upper surface of the bar one at either extremity and one 10 inches from either extremity A box fitted with rollers was prepared to receive the bar each roller mounted in a frame could be fixed in any required position and could at the same time be moved in a vertical direction up or down by means of a slowmotion screw outside the box Now suppose four rollers so fixed in the box that one is under each extremity and two more at 2 inches right and left of the centre of the bar Suppose also four microscopes adjusted over the four dots their axes vertical and their outer foci ranging in a straight horizontal line by the working of the slowmotion screw which it is to be particularly observed does not require the opening of the box or the touching of the bar with the hand the centre rollers can be withdrawn that is lowered until they cease to have contact with the bar and then the bar resting on the extreme rollers can be adjusted to focus under the microscopes The microscopes are then read The extreme rollers are then lowered and the bar conies in contact with the rollers near its centre which are then raised until the dots are in focus The microscopes are now read a second time and by these readings compared with the former are obtained the changes of length of the whole bar and of its subdivisions resulting from the alteration in the positions of the supports The supportingrollers were placed at different times in the following positions 1 at 20 inches right and left of the centre when in this position the supports are MXDcccLxvIL 2 A170 CAPTAIN A

coefficients of expansion of the Indian standards IS IB and of the two other 10foot bars of iron 011 OI2 have been obtained by means of an appa ratus constructed for the purpose Theoretically it is a simple matter to determine the coefficients of expansion of two bars A B it may be done as followsCompare A hot say at a steady temperature of 1000 with B at the temperature of say 400 next compare A at 400 with B at 1000 and lastly compare the bars when both at the same tempera ture But the practical difficulty is to maintain a steady temperature for the hot bar so that it shall not be cooling while under observation This has been effected in the following mannerImagine two closed tanks of copper measuring 124 inches by 5 by 3 inches and suppose them fixed to the upper surface of a stout mahogany plank of the same length and 8 inches broad between the tanks there remains a vacant space 2 inches wide and 5 inches deep into this space the bar goes with its supportingrollers which are capable of slight vertical movement for level or focus adjustment A current of hot water at a steady temperature enters the barroom from without by a flexible tube this current is made to subdivide into four equal streams entering each tank by two orifices in its upper surface at onefourth and threefourths of the length The water escapes from each tank by an orifice at the bottom of either extremity and is conducted out of the barroom through flexible tubes The supply being purposely greater than can be carried away from the extremities an overflow pipe is provided at the centre of the tanks and this overflow is also carried away from the room by flexible tubes Thus a constant circulation of water is maintained and no part of the water in the tanks can be still or cooling nor can the tanks empty or overflow The whole is wvell wrapped up inGEODETICAL STANDARDS WITH THE ENGLISH STANDARD YARD 171 blankets The other bar is similarly mounted between tanks which are full of cold water but no current is required as the observations are made in the cold weather this is also carefully covered with blankets With respect to the interchange of the bars under the microscopes this is effected with all desirable rapidity by a piece of mechanism whereby each bar with its appendage of plank tanks and water is simply rolled away from or up to the microscopes thus the observers do not have to encounter the weight of these masses Thus arranged the comparisons of a hot and cold bar are effected with almost as much facility as the ordinary comparisons The coefficients of expansion

appearance of per sonal error in the observations of three observers from whence these values are deduced It appears that the probable error of a single measurement of a space of n thousand divisions

observers is about  Od316 The Standard Foot and its subdivisionsThe length of this foot F in terms of Y55 was determined as follows Four microscopes 11 I J K were hounted on the stone piers at the

however there is no information as to the precision of the compa risons made by M ARAGO between either Fs or Fb and the toise of Peru But it is to be remarked that if we eliminate N and Fs between the equations 9 11 and 13 we get T10T0100086 as the result of M STRUVES comparisons while from General BAEYERS 10 with 14 T10C 000099 the difference between these two entirely independent values of the Prussian toise is only 01400013 or less than the six millionth part of a toise This shows that ARAGOS assigned lengths of FS F are at any rate admirably consistent We must now explain how the toises a bouts have been compared with the toise a traits Suppose for a moment a cube of steel oneeighth of an inch side its faces polished and a fine dot engraved on one of the faces at about onehundredth of an inch from one of the edges and exactly opposite the middle point of that edge Suppose the toise lying horizontally and consequently its terminal planes in a vertical position and let a cube as described above be applied against each end of the toise the face carrying the dot being uppermost and horizontal then the distance T  6 between the dots when so held is about twohundredths of an inch greater than the toise Next let the cubes be placed in contact under the microscope and the distance of between the dots measured we shall then by subtracting this quantity know the exact length of the toise But the mechanical difficulties to be overcome in this theoretically simple arrangement are found to be very great After numerous experiments in different ways the following modifica tion was adopted suppose a sphere of steel threequarters of an inch in diameter to be cut by two parallel planes oneeighth of an inch apart on opposite sides of and equi distant from the centre Taking the central segment let it be laid on a horizontal plane and cut in two along a diameter leaving two semicircles next let these two pieces without removing either of them from the horizontal plane be placed so that their curved surfaces shall come in contact while their bases or semidiameters are parallel and at the maximum distance apart then the common tangent plane at the point of contact will be a vertical plane even if there should have been any error in the cutting of the sphere so that one of the planes was nearer the centre than the other Next suppose each of these semicircles to be placed on and fastened to a carefully planed rectangular plate of steel say 4 inches long the diameter of the semicircle being perpendicular to the length of the rectangle and the curved surface projecting slightly beyond the end of the plate suppose we have the means of levelling this plate of raising or lowering it small quantities of giving it a small motion in the direction of its length and also in the direction perpendicular to its length and lastly of giving it an azimuthal movement then it is clear that we have absolute command as to position over the semicircular pieces On the upper surface of each semicircle suppose a fine line drawn parallel to the base or perpendicular to the length of the plate and as nearGEODETICAL STANDARDS WITH THE ENGLISH STANDARD YARD 177 as possible to the curved edge Next let the two semicircles be placed in contact the plates being in the same horizontal plane and their lengths parallel in direction the semicircles being kept in contact by pressure of a spring In this position the lines drawn on the semicircles will be parallel and very close to one another If we now by the transverse movement only slightly alter the position of one of the plates the distance of these parallel lines will vary and there is obviously a certain position in which their distance is a maximum this occurs when the vertical tangent plane to the curved surfaces at their point of contact is parallel to the lines This distance when measured is that by which the length of the toise is increased when the contact pieces are adjusted to its extremities In the actual apparatus this distance a from very numerous observations repeated on various occasions is found 565t850 108 millionths of a yard The toise Prussian or Belgian has been invariably supported on four points 2 L5 inches apart For the comparisons at Southampton a stout bar of iron rather more than a toise in length was prepared carrying on its upper surface four rollers fitted with the necessary adjustments for strict alignment at each of its extremities it carried a horizontal brass plate to which the contact apparatus was attached The iron bar itself was held at onefourth and threefourths of its length either support being capable of vertical movement for focus or levelling The four rollers on which the toise lay were adjusted to a horizontal plane by means of a spiritlevel The contact pieces were held in contact with the ends of the toise by spring pressure To prevent any constant error in the comparisons the contacts were renewed after each comparison and all the adjustments thrown out and remade as often as possible The number of comparisons between the Prussian toise and To is very large they extend over twentyfive days involving 2340 micrometer and 520 thermometer readings The resulting difference of length of the two bars at 61025 F is T1oTo154520 15 16 In the case of the Belgian toise the comparisons extend over eight days and with the following result T1lTo15633027 17 From these comparisons it would appear that there is a sensible difference between the Prussian and Belgian toises amounting to 1 81 millionth of a yard whereas General BAEYER found the difference only 002040 The comparisons of the Russian double toise extend over 14 days involving 960 micrometer and 480 thermometer readings Its length in terms of To is found

York was held at Syracuse Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday December 2830 1897 The meeting was by far the largest in the history of the organi zation At the morning session Wednesday the great assem blyroom of the high school was crowded and in the afternoon though the meetings of the science group and the teachers training classes group filled the two large rooms which had been assigned to them the assemblyroom where the English group met was still comfortably filled the attendance at this one group being larger than that of the entire conference at many previous meetings As on all previous occasions the social side was given due prominence The programme provided for an informal meeting and registration in the lobby of the Yates Hotel at 5 PM Tues day The attendance on this occasion was very large At the same place State Superintendent of Public Instruction Charles R Skinner called together some of the most prominent educa tors of the state to perfect plans for the erection of a memorial to the late Principal Sheldon of the Oswego Normal School At this meeting an association was organized to be known as the Sheldon Memorial Association and the following officers were elected President State Superintendent C R Skinner Secre tary H R Sanford Treasurer exSenator George B Sloan The following committee was appointed to devise ways and means Hon Charles R Skinner John M Milne of Geneseo T B Stowell of Potsdam I H Stout of Geneva A B Blodgett of Syracuse Dr O D Robinson of Albany and C E Frank lin of Albany Later it was announced that the committee had decided that the memorial should be either a marble or a bronze statue of Dr Sheldon In the former case it was proposed to 94THE ZIOLIDA Y CONFERENCE OF 1897 place it within the state capitol at Albany in the latter case in the grounds of the capitol To erect such a memorial it was estimated that Ioooo would be necessary and it was proposed that the money should be raised among the school children and educators of the state and paid in during Arbor Day week The reception which the chancellor and faculty of Syracuse University gave in Crouse College Tuesday evening was largely attended The first business session was opened Wednesday morning with a brief address of welcome by the president Oscar D Rob inson in which he expressed the sense of loss which the confer ence had sustained by the death of Principal Sheldon The usual reports of standing committees followed Among these Principal Lyttle of Watertown submitted a report on annuities for teachers in which the following recommendations were made That the Annuity Society should be formed that the membership should be purely voluntary anyone withdrawing should forfeit its benefits the state treasurer to be the custodian of the funds applicants should present a certificate of good health a graduated rate according to age should be made there should be no difference in rates on account of sex and that membership in any city annuity society should not debar anyone from the state organization The report was accepted and the committee continued The first topic for the morning was as follows Is the prep aration made by the grades for admission to the high schools satisfactory  If not how can it be improved  The discus sion was opened by Principal Lyttle of Watertown He answered the question in the negative and criticised in particu lar the course in arithmetic as unnecessarily prolonged The study of geography too was made uninteresting while history was neglected and the work in general deficient on the score of moral training The responsibility for the unsatisfactory state of things the speaker thought was to be charged first to deficiencies in the teachers on the score of knowledge experi ence and personal character and secondly to the unsatisfac 95THE SCHIOOL RE VIEW tory organization of the teaching force In the discussion which followed the subject of arithmetic received much atten tion the prevailing opinion seeming to be that much superfluous matter was included in this subject The introduction of Latin into the primary course was also referred to and opinions seemed to be somewhat divided as to the practicability of put ting this subject into the common schools After a brief recess it was announced that Professor Bennett of Cornell University would open the discussion of the next subject Latin and Greek in the High School Curriculum which the programme announced was to be discussed on the basis of the  Report of the Committee of Twelve of the Ameri can Philological Association Professor Bennett began the discussion by pointing out that the first statement in the Pre liminary Report of the Committee of Twelve was not strictly accurate It seems to be stated therein that the Philological Association directed its Committee of Twelve to draw up their model programmes in response to a request made by the National Educational Association at the Buffalo meeting in July 1896 The facts of the case as shown by Professor Bennett are that the request emanated not from the National Educational Association as a body but from the joint committee on college entrance requirements of the departments of higher and second ary education of the National Educational Association and was made at a meeting at which only six of the ten members of the joint committee were present Further model courses were not asked for but only recommendations of a general nature It was therefore not exactly accurate to assume that the National Association was responsible for these programmes The speaker then proceeded to criticise the programmes in 1 This statement is an entire mistake It is unfortunate that Professor Bennett should have made it and amazing that no one in his audience should have corrected it As a matter of fact the motion to invite the American Philological Association to prepare programmes for Latin and Greek was presented and adopted in a joint meet ing of the Department of Secondary Education and the Department of Higher Educa tion with an attendance of between eight hundred and a thousand one of the largest gatherings of representatives of higher education ever assembled in the United States ED SCHOOL REVIEW 96THE HOLIDAY CONFERENCE OF i897 general expressing himself as feeling no sympathy with the attempts to impose a detailed sequence of study Such a pro cedure made teaching mechanical and method superior to knowledge Professor Bennett closed his paper with a criticism of certain details of the programmes Dr J W Scudder of Albany followed with an address on the teaching of Latin in the secondary schools In the course of his remarks he advocated the introduction of Latin into the grammar school and this brought on a renewal of the discussion of this subject in which many more opinions favorable to the innovation were expressed Of interest in this connection were the remarks of Principal Bartlett of Auburn who reported the successful introduction of the study into the grammar schools of his city Following the innovation of last year the Conference held its session Wednesday afternoon in three groups These were I English in the high school conducted by Principal Chas W Evans 2 Teachers training classes conducted by Prin cipal Frank J House 3 Science in secondary schools its scope and method conducted by Professor E W Wetmore of the State Normal College The proceedings of the several groups are best summarized by the following resolutions which were reported to the Conference at the Thursday morning session The English group reported as follows That the lack of harmony in regard to English teaching is due to two causes First to the fact that new aims have recently appeared to the teachers of English and secondly to the fact that the colleges have made a great diversity of requirements That the best methods of teaching English are yet to be found That every recitation should be made to contribute to good English That much oral composition and topical recitation may profitably be called for That a large amount of poetry and literature adapted to the age of the pupils should be studied in the grades That English should always be regarded as a means not as an end That English should be considered of first importance in the high school and it should not be dropped nor abridged for less important subjects 97THE SCHOOL RE VIEW That the present demands for English are not excessive That daily practice in writing English is desirable but that the written work should be distributed among classes in other subjects That the study of nature is necessary for the highest literary appre ciation That the discussion of the larger principles of literary criticism will greatly add to the pupils interest and form of the basis of much valuable composition work The following resolution was reported to the Conference by the science group Resolved That in every highschool course the equivalent of five periods a week for one year should be devoted to physics The group on Teachers Training Classes reported the following resolution which was adopted among the resolutions of the Conference Resolved That it be the sentiment of this conference that a certain fixed sum of not less less than 500 be granted by the state to every school main taining a training class Wednesday evening President M W Stryker of Hamilton College delivered an address in the City Hall before the confer ence and the New York State Grammar School Council Dr Stryker is a fine speaker and worthily upholds the oratorical tradition of Hamilton College His address on education was largely an eloquent plea for the retention of the oldtime sig nificance of the AB degree The first part of the session Thursday was devoted to busi ness After the reports of the group meetings and the treasurer had been presented the following officers were elected for the ensuing year President J C Norris of Canandaigua Vice President D C Farr of Glens Falls Secretary S D Arms of Palmyra Assistant Secretary Jay Crissey of Belmont Exec utive Committee E W Lyttle of Watertown Dr Edward Hayward of Lockport and W D Johnson of Cooperstown After the business had been disposed of the remainder of the forenoon was devoted to the topics on the programme President Booth C Davis of Alfred University discussed the 98THE HOLIDA Y CONFERENCE OF 1 897 certificate system for college entrance The speaker advocated a system of admission by certificate believing that its success depended on the co6peration and federation of colleges and secondary schools The second topic  History in the High Schools How Much and in What Order  was discussed by Professor W H Mace of Syracuse University who pointed out the different aims that should guide the presentation of the subject in the grammar grades secondary school and college Superintendent A B Blodgett of Syracuse gave a brief address on the Principals Relation to the Community which was received by the Conference with great enthusiasm and by unani mous resolution was ordered printed for distribution through the state Principal Lyttle presented the following report of the Com mittee on Resolutions Resolved That the study of arithmetic should be simplified and that the time given to this subject may be somewhat abridged Resolved That the teaching of geography should be greatly improved that this improvement may be secured by giving greater prominence to relief forms and other physical features as a basis for other work and that history should be correlated with the work in geography Resolved That the grammar school curriculum should be enriched but that great care is necessary in making experiments in this direction on a larger scale Resolved That the Superintendent of Public Instruction of the State of New York be urged to encourage the introduction of the study of Latin or some other foreign language in the eighth and ninth grades Resolved That while we approve of a high standard of requirement for admission to colleges while we do not regard the present requirements as being too high we deplore and deprecate the tendency of the colleges to attempt to prescribe courses of study for secondary schools like that proposed by the Committee of Twelve and desire to register our protest against such attempts Resolved That while we desire uniformity in options we do not desire definite prescription as to either exact subjects or methods for college preparation Resolved That the Associated Academic Principals of the State of New York cordially request the other educational associations of the state to hold 99o00 THE SCHOOL REVIEW each year a winter meeting in Syracuse during holiday week thus establish ing a general educational reunion with opportunity for full personal acquaint ance and conference among representatives of different phases for our common work After the transaction of a few other general items of business the Conference adjourned F H HOWARD COLGATE ACADEMY

TRAINING THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE UNSATISFACTORY STATE OF THINGS THE SPEAKER THOUGHT WAS TO BE CHARGED FIRST TO DEFICIENCIES IN THE TEACHERS ON THE SCORE OF KNOWLEDGE EXPERI ENCE AND PERSONAL CHARACTER AND SECONDLY TO THE UNSATISFAC 95THE SCHIOOL RE VIEW TORY ORGANIZATION OF THE TEACHING FORCE IN THE DISCUSSION WHICH FOLLOWED THE SUBJECT OF ARITHMETIC RECEIVED MUCH ATTEN TION THE PREVAILING OPINION SEEMING TO BE THAT MUCH SUPERFLUOUS MATTER WAS INCLUDED IN THIS SUBJECT THE INTRODUCTION OF LATIN INTO THE PRIMARY COURSE WAS ALSO REFERRED TO AND OPINIONS SEEMED TO BE SOMEWHAT DIVIDED AS TO THE PRACTICABILITY OF PUT TING THIS SUBJECT INTO THE COMMON SCHOOLS AFTER A BRIEF RECESS IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT PROFESSOR BENNETT OF CORNELL UNIVERSITY WOULD OPEN THE DISCUSSION OF THE NEXT SUBJECT LATIN AND GREEK IN THE HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULUM WHICH THE PROGRAMME ANNOUNCED WAS TO BE DISCUSSED ON THE BASIS OF THE  REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF TWELVE OF THE AMERI CAN PHILOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION PROFESSOR BENNETT BEGAN THE DISCUSSION BY POINTING OUT THAT THE FIRST STATEMENT IN THE PRE LIMINARY REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF TWELVE WAS NOT STRICTLY ACCURATE IT SEEMS TO BE STATED THEREIN THAT THE PHILOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION DIRECTED ITS COMMITTEE OF TWELVE TO DRAW UP THEIR MODEL PROGRAMMES IN RESPONSE TO A REQUEST MADE BY THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION AT THE BUFFALO MEETING IN JULY 1896 THE FACTS OF THE CASE AS SHOWN BY PROFESSOR BENNETT ARE THAT THE REQUEST EMANATED NOT FROM THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION AS A BODY BUT FROM THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON COLLEGE ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS OF THE DEPARTMENTS OF HIGHER AND SECOND ARY EDUCATION OF THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND WAS MADE AT A MEETING AT WHICH ONLY SIX OF THE TEN MEMBERS OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE WERE PRESENT FURTHER MODEL COURSES WERE NOT ASKED FOR BUT ONLY RECOMMENDATIONS OF A GENERAL NATURE IT WAS THEREFORE NOT EXACTLY ACCURATE TO ASSUME THAT THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE PROGRAMMES THE SPEAKER THEN PROCEEDED TO CRITICISE THE PROGRAMMES IN 1 THIS STATEMENT IS AN ENTIRE MISTAKE IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT PROFESSOR BENNETT SHOULD HAVE MADE IT AND AMAZING THAT NO ONE IN HIS AUDIENCE SHOULD HAVE CORRECTED IT AS A MATTER OF FACT THE MOTION TO INVITE THE AMERICAN PHILOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION TO PREPARE PROGRAMMES FOR LATIN AND GREEK WAS PRESENTED AND ADOPTED IN A JOINT MEET ING OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SECONDARY EDUCATION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HIGHER EDUCA TION WITH AN ATTENDANCE OF BETWEEN EIGHT HUNDRED AND A THOUSAND ONE OF THE LARGEST GATHERINGS OF REPRESENTATIVES OF HIGHER EDUCATION EVER ASSEMBLED IN THE UNITED STATES ED SCHOOL REVIEW 96THE HOLIDAY CONFERENCE OF I897 GENERAL EXPRESSING HIMSELF AS FEELING NO SYMPATHY WITH THE ATTEMPTS TO IMPOSE A DETAILED SEQUENCE OF STUDY SUCH A PRO CEDURE MADE TEACHING MECHANICAL AND METHOD SUPERIOR TO KNOWLEDGE PROFESSOR BENNETT CLOSED HIS PAPER WITH A CRITICISM OF CERTAIN DETAILS OF THE PROGRAMMES DR J W SCUDDER OF ALBANY FOLLOWED WITH AN ADDRESS ON THE TEACHING OF LATIN IN THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN THE COURSE OF HIS REMARKS HE ADVOCATED THE INTRODUCTION OF LATIN INTO THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL AND THIS BROUGHT ON A RENEWAL OF THE DISCUSSION OF THIS SUBJECT IN WHICH MANY MORE OPINIONS FAVORABLE TO THE INNOVATION WERE EXPRESSED OF INTEREST IN THIS CONNECTION WERE THE REMARKS OF PRINCIPAL BARTLETT OF AUBURN WHO REPORTED THE SUCCESSFUL INTRODUCTION OF THE STUDY INTO THE GRAMMAR SCHOOLS OF HIS CITY FOLLOWING THE INNOVATION OF LAST YEAR THE CONFERENCE HELD ITS SESSION WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON IN THREE GROUPS THESE WERE I ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL CONDUCTED BY PRINCIPAL CHAS W EVANS 2 TEACHERS TRAINING CLASSES CONDUCTED BY PRIN CIPAL FRANK J HOUSE 3 SCIENCE IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS ITS SCOPE AND METHOD CONDUCTED BY PROFESSOR E W WETMORE OF THE STATE NORMAL COLLEGE THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE SEVERAL GROUPS ARE BEST SUMMARIZED BY THE FOLLOWING RESOLUTIONS WHICH WERE REPORTED TO THE CONFERENCE AT THE THURSDAY MORNING SESSION THE ENGLISH GROUP REPORTED AS FOLLOWS THAT THE LACK OF HARMONY IN REGARD TO ENGLISH TEACHING IS DUE TO TWO CAUSES FIRST TO THE FACT THAT NEW AIMS HAVE RECENTLY APPEARED TO THE TEACHERS OF ENGLISH AND SECONDLY TO THE FACT THAT THE COLLEGES HAVE MADE A GREAT DIVERSITY OF REQUIREMENTS THAT THE BEST METHODS OF TEACHING ENGLISH ARE YET TO BE FOUND THAT EVERY RECITATION SHOULD BE MADE TO CONTRIBUTE TO GOOD ENGLISH THAT MUCH ORAL COMPOSITION AND TOPICAL RECITATION MAY PROFITABLY BE CALLED FOR THAT A LARGE AMOUNT OF POETRY AND LITERATURE ADAPTED TO THE AGE OF THE PUPILS SHOULD BE STUDIED IN THE GRADES THAT ENGLISH SHOULD ALWAYS BE REGARDED AS A MEANS NOT AS AN END THAT ENGLISH SHOULD BE CONSIDERED OF FIRST IMPORTANCE IN THE HIGH SCHOOL AND IT SHOULD NOT BE DROPPED NOR ABRIDGED FOR LESS IMPORTANT SUBJECTS 97THE SCHOOL RE VIEW THAT THE PRESENT DEMANDS FOR ENGLISH ARE NOT EXCESSIVE THAT DAILY PRACTICE IN WRITING ENGLISH IS DESIRABLE BUT THAT THE WRITTEN WORK SHOULD BE DISTRIBUTED AMONG CLASSES IN OTHER SUBJECTS THAT THE STUDY OF NATURE IS NECESSARY FOR THE HIGHEST LITERARY APPRE CIATION THAT THE DISCUSSION OF THE LARGER PRINCIPLES OF LITERARY CRITICISM WILL GREATLY ADD TO THE PUPILS INTEREST AND FORM OF THE BASIS OF MUCH VALUABLE COMPOSITION WORK THE FOLLOWING RESOLUTION WAS REPORTED TO THE CONFERENCE BY THE SCIENCE GROUP RESOLVED THAT IN EVERY HIGHSCHOOL COURSE THE EQUIVALENT OF FIVE PERIODS A WEEK FOR ONE YEAR SHOULD BE DEVOTED TO PHYSICS THE GROUP ON TEACHERS TRAINING CLASSES REPORTED THE FOLLOWING RESOLUTION WHICH WAS ADOPTED AMONG THE RESOLUTIONS OF THE

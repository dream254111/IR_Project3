University It is now nine years since the outbreak of the Chinese revolu tion It is fifteen years since the Manchus attempted to main tain their control by introducing representative institutions into China The development toward constitutional and represen tative government under the Manchus was checked in 1911 by the revolutionary movement When the Chinese Republic was established as the successor to the alien Manchu Empire it was felt that the problem of modernizing China bade fair to be solved and that in an orderly way her political institutions would be brought into harmony with western standards Unfor tunately that orderly progress has not come Parliamentary government under the Nanking provisional Constitution was replaced by the dictatorship of Yuan Shihkai under the arrange ments of the socalled constitutional compact which in turn was followed by the attempt to reestablish the monarchy The failure of the monarchy movement brought back parliamentary government but before a permanent constitution could be adopted Parliament was again dissolved and a government controlled by a military clique set up in its place Since this military government was unacceptable to the southern prov inces the country became divided So far it has not been possible for the country to reconcile its differences Instead of an ordered constitutional progress has come apparent failure in the effort to establish representative government The name of a republic has been maintained it is true and the forms of constitutional government have been retained but a permanent national government has not been set up nor has popular gov ernment replaced the paternal despotism of the past 233234 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW A variety of causes have produced this result Among these causes may be noted the lack of readiness of the people to assume power the lack of an adequate understanding on the part of the revolutionary leaders of the problems the difficulties and the responsibilities of parliamentary government the com plication of the internal problem by the nature of the relation ships established by the European Powers in China both with respect to the Republic itself and among themselves the new problems created by the outbreak of the World War with the concentration of the attention of Europe and the United States on the European situation which has made possible the devel opment of Japanese hegemony in the Far East and finally the presence in China of a military power which existing by the side of the civil administration from the beginning was able to completely overshadow it and finally to entrench itself in control of the government The last of these causes of the failure of representative government in China deserves a more extended consideration than has commonly been given it in discussions of Chinese politics During the first years of the Republic the power of the mili tary chiefs was in the provinces rather than in the national government and their final control of the central government has rested upon their strength in the provinces Consequently in order to understand the successive mutations of national politics it is necessary to consider the structure of the provincial and local governments for in the nature of local government in China and in the relationships of the provinces and the central government can be found the explanation of the fact that regard less of the control at Peking or the apparent division of the country the Chinese people have continued in their usual man ner of living undisturbed by revolution or by foreign domina tion of the state No matter how extensive the foreign control of the national government China will continue to exist through her local institutions Before the foreign impact on China began to be felt the admin istration of the country was extremely decentralized Com munication between the capital and the provinces and betweenCONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN CHINA 235 provinces was slow and unsatisfactory the lack of facilities for travel prevented a strong central control or the growth of any great feeling of unity among the provinces The country was not in intimate relationship with the nonChinese world and its very isolation aided in emphasizing internal differences of habit and tradition These differences were very marked in respect to such things as dialect food preparation and even law To the individual a man from another province was a stranger a foreigner There was developed a provincial and a local rather than a national feeling Instead of a man calling himself a Chinese he was an Anhui or Kuangtung man This spirit of provincialism was further developed through the differences existing between sections within the province Thus the Anhui man was more definitely particularized as being from a certain hsien or district within the province Hsien pride was even more highly developed than provincial patriotism From the political and imperial standpoint this provincial distinctness was recognized in the large measure of administra tive autonomy accorded to the province As Morse points out as long as it contributed its share of the imperial revenue and followed the general policy of the central government there was no direct interference in the affairs of the province And even in determining the general policy of the state the action of the Emperor tended toward the hortatory rather than the mandatory This feeling of the distinctness of provincial from imperial interest was well brought out at the time when England was using force to secure the opening of the country to foreign inter course During the second of the socalled Opium Wars when the British were engaged in active operations against the city of Canton friendly relations with the people and officials were maintained at the other open ports Later when the British and French were hammering on the gates of Peking and the Court had been forced to flee to the North the imperial author ities at Shanghai felt entirely free to accept British aid in the 1 Trade and Administration of the Chinese Empire pp 4849

Japanese and the Chinese in 189495 the southern and central provinces refused to lend their full strength to the defence of the northern frontier on the ground that their interests were not affected Not only was there a feeling of the separateness of provincial from imperial interests but there was a similar lack of integration of the inter ests of neighboring provinces For example in time of a flood of the Yellow River instead of all of the affected provinces cooperatively safeguarding the common interests each province safeguarded itself without considering the way in which the measures taken might be adversely affecting its neighbor This lack of cooperation extended into many phases of interpro vincial life From the structural standpoint prerevolutionary China had a wellworkedout provincial administrative system All of the officials from the highest the viceroy or governor to the lowest the district magistrate were appointed and removed by the Emperor Gradations in the provincial hierarchy were care fully worked out to the end that there should be a definite fixa tion of responsibility Thus the viceroy was held responsible for the maintenance of peace order and prosperity in the prov ince or provinces under his jurisdiction the governor in the province the prefect in the largest territorial division of the province and the magistrate in the district But within the broad restrictions necessitated in maintaining peace and order transmitting the required funds to the imperial treasury and not directly acting counter to the general policy prescribed from Peking the officials were permitted large discretion in their respective governments Consequently ways and means were determined locally rather than nationally with the result that direct imperial commands were executed variously from province to province according to the variations in local custom and tradition and also according to the difference in point of view and interest of the provincial officials In the same way there was a similar although perhaps lesser variation from district 2 Williams Middle Kingdom II p 606CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN CHINA 237 to district within the province The large discretionary power exercised by the provincial officer was brought out very clearly in 1900 during the Boxer troubles At that time the imperial instructions were carried out completely in Chihli province but were as completely disregarded by Yuan Shihkai in Shantung and by Chang Chihtung in the central Yangtze provinces Similarly national treaty obligations were carried out differently in different parts of the country This is revealed in the com munications addressed from time to time to the Chinese govern nment by the representatives of the Powers The lack of uni formity is further shown in the expostulations of the Emperor Kuang Hsu at the time of the reform movement of 1898 In one of the edicts of the times he exhorts the officials to a greater show of zeal in carrying out the proposed reforms pointing out the fact that while changes had been made in some provinces in others nothing at all had been done to carry out the imperial policy Up to the beginning of the constitutional movement in 1905 the provincial governor had the same theoretically unlimited authority in the province as the Emperor had in the Empire Both were however unlimited only in theory since the danger of uprising against their authority forced them to govern their actions by the prescriptions of custom and tradition In China a country of custom ingrained and fixed through the centuries the possibility of insurrection naturally constituted a very great limitation on the exercise of power But disorder or the threat of disorder was the only way of calling attention to popular feeling and this method was used chiefly in grave cases or in times of economic disturbance No branch of either the national or provincial government served as the exponent of public opinions The most important feature of the constitutional movement under the Manchus was the endeavor to establish representative assemblies This movement resulted in a very important modification of the provincial governments I There was it is true the censorate to keep the Emperor in touch with the provinces but the censors represented the Emperor and not the people and were interested in public opinion only as a reflection on the exercise of power by an imperial officer238 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW An imperial edict issued in 1907 provided for the establish ment of assemblies in the provinces with the power to discuss pass resolutions and apply to their Viceroys or Governors for decision and execution4 These assemblies were actually established and opened in the fall of 1909 Of their powers and position it has been said that an assembly is the connecting link between local and national government secondly it is a channel to direct the opinions of the people of a province to the notice of the executive in order that the executive may have a more complete knowledge of the needs of the people than it would otherwise obtain but the assembly is only a channel of speech It is not an instrument for action it can only offer advice and the advice it may offer is strictly confined to mat ters within definite limits and thirdly the assembly performs a function of education It trains men and provides them with experience for the higher duties to be met with in the national Parliament In addition to these main purposes it has the right to criticize and censure the action of executive officials though it has no power to punish or degrade After their convocation these assemblies immediately began to assert them selves in the limited field marked out for their activity and to assume even greater powers than had been granted In addi tion to interfering in provincial matters they constituted a focal point for provincial opposition to the central government and for the agitation for an early summoning of the national par liament By 1911 the assembly had established itself as an effective part of the provincial system of government During the ten year period preceding the downfall of the Manchus the problems of foreign intercourse had brought home to the imperial authorities the necessity for a greater centraliza tion of the state Peking had been forced to interfere more and more in the administration of the provinces in order to secure greater uniformity in the execution of public policy This movement toward centralization had of course aroused great 4China Year Book 1912 p 355 1 Bevan Constitution Building in China Cited in China Year Book 1912 p 364CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN CHINA 239 opposition in the provinces With the beginnings of the con stitutional movement after 1905 a general policy of centraliza tion had been definitely adopted This was extended to railroad construction and operation The policy of extended construc tion under central direction necessarily involved the introduction of increased amounts of foreign capital into China and it also forecast the limitation of provincial railway enterprise Conse quently provincial opposition to the policy developed so strongly that it had to be virtually abandoned At the time of the con clusion of the Hukuang railway loan with the Four Power Bank ing Group in the spring of 1911 open revolt came in the great western province Szechuen The spirit of revolt spread until in the fall of 1911 it resulted in the revolution which brought about the abdication of the Manchu Emperor The Chinese revolution of 1911 was not a carefully planned wellorganized movement It got under way in the various provinces at different times and for differing reasons There had been a long continued antiManchu agitation directed by revolutionary organizations it is true but the actual outbreak was spontaneous and it was only with the growth of the move ment that it came under a common direction6 The immediate cause of the initial blow at Wuchang was a mutiny of the impe rial troops stationed there The direction of the Wuchang operations was put in the hands of one of the imperial officers Li Yuanhung Because of his strategic location General Li rapidly became a dominating figure in the revolutionary coun cils The mutiny at Wuchang was followed by the formation of a revolutionary party at Shanghai and by the repudiation of the Manchu authority by the commanders of the Yangtze fleet and the reduction of Nanking through the combined action of a military and naval force which gave the revolutionists control of central China and also cut off the southern provinces from Peking The provinces to the south of the Yangtze one by one joined the opposition to the Manchus In many cases this was accomplished by the provincial officials announcing their adher I China Year Book 1912 pp xixii 7 At the central point of the Yangtze valley240 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW ence to the revolutionary cause through a simple declaration of the independence of the province Where the officials remained faithful to the central government control was assumed either by revolutionary bodies or by the regular provincial assemblies Finally in order that there should be some common authority empowered to speak for the revolution the selfconstituted Military Government of the Chinese People which had come into power at Shanghai requested the independent provinces to send delegates to Nanking to form a government able to speak for all factions8 These delegates were appointed in vari ous ways depending upon the nature of the control in the prov inces Thus some were appointed by the provincial assemblies some by the officials who controlled the province and some were selfappointeds It was with this Nanking assembly that Yuan Shihkai negotiated the settlement by which the Manchu Emperor abdicated and the republican form of government was accepted for a united China The conclusion of peace naturally found considerable bodies of men under arms in all parts of China At the time of the outbreak there were two types of effective military organization in the country In 1901 the imperial government had begun the development of a national army the Luchun Eventually the direction and control of this force was to be centralized in a board of war at Peking with a distinct military organization in the provinces By 1911 thirtysix divisions had been organized but only a part of this force had been removed from the control of the viceroys or governors In addition to this national army each province had its own force which was in the nature of a provincial constabulary These troops were under the direct control of the viceroy10 Furthermore they were paid from the provincial purse Consequently the obedience of the soldier was rendered to the governor or commander and he proved equally 8 Up to this time the imperial government had dealt with Li Yuanhung as the leader of the revolution 9 These last were the gentry of the province who were looked to as leaders in the absence of any official direction 10 China Year Book 1912 ch 15 By an imperial edict of 1907 the viceroy was given control of the military administration in his jurisdiction Ibid p 237CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN CHINA 241 ready to fight for the Emperor or against him as the will and interest of his employer directed These regular troops were increased in every province with the progress of the revolution recruits coming particularly from among those whose economic condition was poor In many cases bands of brigands were transformed into regular troops under the command of the pro vincial authorities At a time when civil control was relaxed the more soldiers a man had under his command the greater would be his political influence Military dictatorships were set up in many of the provinces both in the North and the South there being only this difference between the two sections of the country the southern commanders paid lipservice to the cause of the revolu tion while the northern generals continued to recognize the imperial authority In addition to military provincial govern ments individual military leaders had to be reckoned with as semiindependent powers existing in many provinces as impe ria in imperio Yuan Shihkais accession to the presidency in 1912 was decid edly the result of a compromise between conflicting interests By the terms of the abdication edicts he was given full power to establish a republican government for China and to reach an agreement with the Nanking revolutionary government by which the North and the South would be united As the supreme commander of the imperial forces he alone had the allegiance of the northern generals Either the revolutionary party must accept Yuan and give him position and power in the Republic or it must overthrow him by force The latter appeared to be impossible since the southern leaders had reached the end of their financial resources An agreement was reached therefore by which he accepted the principles of the revolution and was chosen by the Nanking assembly as the provisional President of the Republic12 Such as General Chang Hsun the commander of the imperial forces at Nanking 12 Li Yuanhung was chosen vicepresident However he remained at his post in central China242 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW The new government recognized the existing condition by accepting the de facto authority in the province whatever its source and authorizing it as the temporary agency for provincial administration North of the Yangtze the provincial authori ties followed the leadership of Yuan Shihkai while in the rest of the country Parliament was recognized as supreme Imme diately upon the establishment of the government a conflict developed between the executive and the assembly Yuan Shihkai was interested mainly in restoring the country to a condition of peace and order the assembly in asserting the supremacy of Parliament over the executive under the Nanking provisional constitution Because of this difference in aim the policy of the President appeared to be constructive and that of Parliament obstructive Consequently even liberals of the type of Liang ChiChao3 came to support extensions of execu tive power as opposed to that of Parliament Conflict both in the provinces and in Peking resulted in triumphs for the President Early in 1913 President Yuan began the necessary work of reestablishing civil government in the provinces to replace the control of the military Had he begun differently he might have conciliated the elements antagonistic to his authority but he first appointed civil administrators in the provinces where the opposition was in control thus casting a doubt on the sincerity of his desire to replace military with civil authority except where by so doing he could strengthen his own position On the other hand it can be argued reasonably that since Parliament had shown an inability to grapple with the problems of the state and to present a constructive policy for their solution the good of the country demanded that Yuan Shihkai should not weaken his own control Such a weakening might well have followed the establishing of civil government in the northern provinces before the President has consolidated his power in the center and south of the country An uprising the Summer Revolution of 1913 followed the appointment of a civil administrator to share the authority of the Tuchun or military governor of Kiangsi province The 13 One of the leaders in the reform movement of 1S98CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN CHINA 243 revolt was easily put down and it was followed by the virtual dissolution of Parliament through the dissolution of the Kuo Ming or Radical party which was suspected of a share in the revolt Yuan Shihkai then proceeded to rule as dictator although he preserved the forms of constitutional government The constitutional compact4 replaced the Nanking constitution as the supreme law of the land Under it the President was given the dominating position in the government the represen tative body provided for being given no powers which could be used to limit executive control Yuan however was not satis fied with the fact of power but wished the name also Conse quently an attempt was made to replace the dictatorship in the Republic by the reestablishment of the monarchy with Yuan Shihkai as Emperor With the failure of the monarchy movement and the death of Yuan came a change in the internal struggle The power of the President had resulted from his control of the leaders of the army both provincial and national No one of the Tuchuns was strong enough to dispute his control and parliamentary government had been impossible because of it With the removal of his strong hand the northern military party proved to be leaderless The new President Li Yuanhungs was a military man but more in sympathy with the southern than the northern point of view Yuan Shihkais chief lieutenant Tuan Chijui exercised the real executive power through his position as premier and thus had some claim to leadership But while a member of the northern military party Tuan did not occupy a position of undisputed leadership of all elements in the party as had his chief 14 Framed by a conference or council set up by the President 15 The fact that power in the government was proportioned to the direct con trol of troops is well illustrated in the career of Li Yuanhung While he re mained among his soldiery at Wuchang he was a power to be reckoned with but when he left Wuchang to assume his vicepresidential office in Peking at the re quest of the President he became negligible as a factor in national and provincial politics until his accession to the presidency He succeeded to that office because to haste left the regular line of succession would have precipitated a struggle between contesting factions in the military party244 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW Parliament came back to Peking after the collapse of the monarchy movement restored to its full powers and dominating position under the Nanking constitution The President imme diately announced his intention of accepting his constitutional position of practical subordination to the Parliament For a time it seemed that an orderly evolution toward true parliamen tary government would be possible The chief military leader in the state having been removed all that the central govern ment had to contend against was a divided military power with out an accepted leadership Singly the military chiefs could not hope to retain the power that had been gained by submission to a common leadership That the Tuchuns were no more prepared to acquiesce in parliamentary government than they had been during the rule of Yuan Shihkai was soon indicated Lacking the leadership of one man they resorted to conference action to reach an agree ment on a common policy The first conference was held under the direction of the most notorious of their number Chang Hsun16 at his stronghold Hsuchow in the fall of 1916 shortly after the meeting of Parliament At that time a theoretical union of the provinces was effected which was nothing but a league of the military leaders of the northern provinces formed for the purpose of perpetuating their own power At this first meeting virtual notice was served on Parliament that it would do well not to forget the presence in China of a power prepared to protect its own interests by force if necessary against the civil authority This threat caused considerable apprehension for a time but as words were not followed by action the Peking government gradually lost its sense of insecurity Until early in 1917 nothing further was heard from the Tuchuns directly except as military backing enabled Tuan Chijui to maintain himself in a struggle against Parliament In February 16 Chang Hsun had risen to position from the ranks In 1911 he was com manderinchief of the Kiangnan forces When driven from Nanking by the revolutionists he retreated with his troops up the railroad toward Tientsin After the abdication he was subsidized by the government to prevent his acting against it Aside from this subsidy he maintained himself on the loot taken from Nanking at the time of its evacuation and by levying tribute on the countryCONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN CHINA 245 came the announcement of the extended German submarine warfare Under the leadership of the United States China protested against it as a violation of international law During the next few months the government was forced step by step toward a declaration of war on Germany The progress of events naturally brought a difference of opinion as to the proper policy to be pursued This eventually developed into a struggle between the premier and the majority party in Parliament Finally in order to show a public opinion supporting his war policy and also in order to divert attention from the unsatis factory state of negotiations with the Allied Powers in regard to the conditions of Chinese participation in the war the premier summoned a conference of the military chiefs to consider the question at issue This again brought the question of military dictation of policy to the front The conference declared for the war policy and preparations were made to secure the necessary parliamentary authorization From all indications the govern ment had a sufficient majority in Parliament to pass the war bill But unfortunately as Parliament was about to consider the measure a mob shouting for favorable action assembled outside the parliamentary building Parliament took this demonstration as an attempt to force its hand and refused to act The cabinet with the exception of the premier resigned an1 Parliament demanded his resignation He refused to vacate his office voluntarily but stood his ground until the President dismissed him fAll of this brought an immediate response from the northern militarists They protested against the dismissal of Tuan and then demanded the dissolution of Parliament basing the demand for a dissolution on the unsatisfactory nature of the permanent constitution in the process of formulation by Parliament The President at first refused to dissolve Parliament so that in order to gain their point several of the Tuchuns declared their provinces independent and organized a punitive expedition against Peking In addition to this a revolutionary government was established in Tientsin President Li finally weakened to the extent of asking one of the military leaders Chang Hsun to246 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW come to Peking to mediate One result of this mediation was the dissolution of Parliament Another was the temporary establishment of Chang Hsun as dictator to the central govern ment His dictatorship resulted in an abortive attempt to bring the Manchu Emperor back to power The Tuchuns marching on Peking met this move however by changing the aim of their punitive expedition from the overthrow of Parliament to the restoration of the Republic and under the leadership of Tuan Chijui soon effected their object The rapid succession of events from February to August 1917 had resulted in a second dissolution of Parliament the assump tion of control of the central government by the northern militarists the restoration of Tuan Chijui and the resignation of President Li who had been forced to flee to the Legation Quarter at the time of Chang Hsuns coup detat and who refused to resume his office giving way formally to the vice president General Feng Kuochang The new President was the leader of one faction of the Peiyang military party7 It soon developed that the premier was the leader of another so that the new regime was not destined to be an harmonious one The squabbles at Peking however were more in the nature of personal contests for power than a struggle between widely different ideas During the months following the dissolution of Parliament its members gradually concentrated in the South finally establish ing a constitutional government with headquarters at Canton The southern provinces supported the Canton government in the struggle that was undertaken against the government in the North and the country was divided along the same terri torial lines that had marked the division of territory between the revolutionists and the Manchus in 1911 As time went on the contest took on more the character of the outs to get in and ins to stay there than a struggle between two principles of governmentthe civil against the military The southern 17 General Feng recognized the danger to his power if he left his troops For that reason he entered upon extended negotiations to safeguard himself before he would consent to come to PekingCONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN CHINA 247 provinces had developed the same type of military government as that which had assumed control of the North and the south ern militarists began to gain control of the southern government The war was not carried on very vigorously by either side there being frequent attempts to find a basis of agreement satis factory to all elements At last a peace conference was con vened at Shanghai to settle the struggle One of the great obstacles to peace was recognized to be the presence of so many men under arms and the continued interference of the military chiefs in the determination of the policy of the government One of the propositions brought before the conference by the south ern delegation provided for the reduction of troops to the pre revolutionary number and the abolition of the office of Tuchun military governor These two propositions if assented to and carried out in good faith by both sides would have resulted in the disestablishment of the military party both in the North and the South and would have removed the greatest single obstacle in the way of the progressive development of democratic government in China The Tuchuns however were not pre pared to abdicate voluntarily so that no solution of the question at issue was arrived at nor have the months from the opening of the conference in December 1918 to the present time brought any agreement8 Not only has it been impossible to reunite the north and the south politically but factional strife within both the northern and southern governments has brought further complications So long as the northern military leaders were confronted by the parliamentary party interest dictated cooperation among them selves But when they found themselves in undisputed control of the Peking government they began to diverge in their inter ests First came the struggle between Tuan Chijui the premier and the President Feng Kuochang After the elimination of Feng and the election of Hsii Shihchang as president the mili taly chiefs grouped themselves in two main parties the Anhui group under the leadership of Tuan Chijui and the Chihli 18 In October 1920 the Kwangsi government returned to Peking allegiance and the president announced the unification of the country But renewed ac tivity in the south by Dr Sun YatSen indicates that unity is not yet attained248 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW group led by such men as Tsao Kun the viceroy of Chihli pro vince and Chang Tsolin the viceroy of the three Manchurian provinces The Anhui group organized as the Anfu Club Society for Peace and Blessingostensibly for the purpose of electing Hsft Shihchang to the presidency gained and retained con trol of the Peking government for the year and a half from the time of its organization to July 1920 The club used its control to perpetuate the power of its members In order to do this it necessarily tended to exclude nonAnfu men from par ticipation in the division of the spoils of office The members of the club financed themselves by repeated borrowings from Japan and consequently any movement to oust them from power would naturally have considerable popular support9 The antagonism between the two factions in the North brought them to blows in the summer of 1920 The immediate cause of the open rupture seems to have been the refusal of the govern ment to furnish the money necessary to enable the Chihli com manders to pay their troops The issue was joined when Tuan Chijui asked the President to issue a mandate dismissing Tsao Kun and one of his division commanders Wu Peifu The grounds assigned were that the latter had requested permission to return north with his troops from Hunan province and when the request had been granted instead of returning directly the troops had delayed in Honan province20 Under pressure President Hsi Shihchang issued the mandate2 General Wu however led his troops against Peking and supported by Fgng tien troops sent to his assistance by General Chang Tsolin he was able to force Tuan and the adherents of the Anfu Club to seek shelter at the Japanese legation 19 In fact the student movement was developed largely because of the reported selling out of the country to Japan The movement took on the form of a propaganda among the lower classes and in the army for the purpose of enlightening the people ap to the true state of affairs both internally and exter nally Undoubtedly the student agitation and propaganda had something to do with the easy overthrow of the Anfu Club 20 For summary of Tuans statement and request see Millards Review July 31 1920 pp 469470 21 For the text of the dismissal mandate see ibidCONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN CHINA 249 The first reaction to the change was that it meant the elimina tion of military government since General Wu proposed the summoning of a national convention to determine all of the points at issue in the state22 So far however the only prac tical result has been the transfer of power from one military clique to another What have been the means by which the Tuchuns have sup ported themselves and their troops During the months follow ing the outbreak of the revolution in 1911 the collection of money for the imperial government naturally ceased in the rebellious provinces Such revenue as was collected was retained in the provincial treasuries and was used to defray the expenses of provincial administration Since the military commander controlled the government in many of the provinces he made the maintenance of his troops a first charge on the revenue As the allegiance of the troops was largely personal no matter what his source of supply the commander was regarded as the actual source of revenue by his men However even with his direct personal interest in the payment of the troops the Tuchun because of the inadequacy of the available revenue continually found himself in financial difficulties With the unsettled con dition of the country it was hard to collect the taxes and to keep a regular inflow of money Consequently when the new government was set up under Yuan Shihkai the pay of the soldiers was greatly in arrears23 To disband them without full payment would have aroused dissatisfaction and perhaps pro duced open revolt against the new regime Furthermore the commanders refused to demobilize the men without entire pay ment From another point of view demobilization presented a serious problem that of restoring the men to civil life on such 22 A similar demand came from the students GeneralWu became a national hero because of his attitude But his chief Tsao Kun and General Chang seem to have refused to accept his proposals and by himself he did not have sufficient power to demand action 23 It may reasonably be argued that it was to the commanders interest to have the pay in arrears since that gave him an additional hold on his men Of course he had to keep them fed and clothed and see that they were partly paid in order to prevent a dangerous dissatisfaction250 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW terms as to enable them to earn a living and thus prevent them from becoming charges on the community or being forced into a condition of banditry Because of lack of financial resource then the government was unable to cope with the problem of the military even if it had had the desire24 In addition to the payment of the men there was the necessity of finding enough money to buy off the military leaders who were not prepared to give up their dominating position without some personal recompense Since the government could not get rid of them the only thing that could be done seemingly was to make use of the Tuchuns and their troops As has already been pointed out in most cases their position as the de facto provincial governments was legalized and they were used to maintain peace and order in the provinces until civil authority could be reestablished25 It was much better for example to give General Chang Hsun a title and interest him in the main tenance of the new government than to make him its active enemy especially in view of the fact that he had a sufficient following to maintain himself by force of arms But of course the longer the government delayed its action the greater grew the difficulty of acting for the amount of back pay due the soldiers increased and their leaders became ever less desirous of reaching an agree ment by which they would lose their power Had Yuan Shih kai not allowed personal ambition to obscure the needs of the state a gradual transition from a war to a peace basis might have been effected and the Tuchuns have been made the serv ants of the state instead of its masters But he used the mili tary power in the province to advance his own ends precipi tating a struggle that brought into definite antagonism the advocates of civil government and his military supporters If Li Yuanhung had been a strong personality instead of an idol with feet of clay the subordination of the military to the civil 24 One of the purposes to which the reorganization loan of 1913 was to be devoted was the disbandment of the troops However the development of the struggle between Yuan and Parliament prevented the undertaking of the work 26 As a matter of fact order was maintained in the provinces under the control of the strong leadersCONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN CHINA 251 power might well have been brought about even as late as 1917 But each successive crisis in national politics worked to strengthen the position of those in control of the provinces until they were able to establish themselves in absolute control of the national government as well as the government of the provinces Since the militarists have had such a large part in the modifi cation of the direction of the constitutional movement in China it is fair to ask in conclusion what use they have made of their power since it has been firmly established Peace and a con sequent prosperity have not been brought about in China as is shown by the continuance of the civil war It was only the protest of the Powers and the threat of a refusal of funds from abroad that brought the northerners into conference at Shang hai The country as a whole has suspected with a consider able show of reason that the central government has been accepting dictation of its policy from Tokyo in return for aid in the form of loans This suspicion coupled with the Shantung award made at Paris has produced a nationwide protest directed against Japan in the form of a boycott and against the central government in the form of mob demonstrations the formation of patriotic societies and threats against the lives of officials suspected of selling out the country to its island neighbor Dur ing the period from 1917 to April 1920 excluding 1919 there were nineteen separate loans concluded with Japan totalling yen 281543762 some of them for administrative expenses others ostensibly for industrial development In 1919 alone twentytwo loans were made principally from Japan Some of these sums were obtained without definite security but many were secured by provincial revenues or were made in return for mining or other concessions Little of the money received has actually been used for the development of the country either politically or economically It is of course impossible to say how much of it has gone to line the pockets of the officials of the civil and military services but certainly a large share of it has been used to maintain the military power in control of China and to provide retiring allowances for officials26 26 See Millards Review for February 5 and 19 on the influence of the associ ation of Chinese bankers in beginning a reform of governmental methods252 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW A writer in Millards Review says of the militarists that they are not militaristic and autocratic in the philosophical fanat ical and semireligious sense in which their contemporaries in Germany and Japan are obsessed Nor are they united as the vassals of a common demigod or Emperor They have no dreams of Weltpolitik neither are they possessed of the idea that they are ordained of God to rule the earth They pursue their policy for perfectly selfish and unromantic reasonsfor fuhkuei wealth and position of which kuei or position is merely the temporary stepping stone to the ultimate ambition fuh which is measured in dollars and taels They are mutual friends when it pays to be friends meeting with the glad hand and a dagger up the sleeve intriguing with one another cliquing together or selling one another out hesitating in fear and uncertainty always with a foresight as far as the end of their noses and a policy as variable as the Peking winds   There is no settled policy on anything in Peking today except that of getting as much private gain out of the business of government as possible To this one principle the majority of officials whole heartedly and unreservedly subscribe It is to this government for personal gain that China has come in the course of her endeavor to shake off an alien autocracy and stand with the democratic states of the world New forces however have been set in motion recently which may ultimately weaken the hold of the military chiefs on the state A patriotic wave has swept the country as a result of the Far Eastern settle ment at Paris a national patriotism is in the process of develop ment and this new spirit under proper leadership is directing its action not alone against illegitimate foreign interests in China but against the military octopus which has enveloped the political and administrative machinery of the state

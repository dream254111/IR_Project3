to have yet arrived in England We imagine that some such accident must have happened also to the exhibits of the Australian museum at Sydney for this institution which was well represented at the fisheries has here a very poor show which would indeed be improved were the specimens named The finest set in the New South Wales court is the magnificent collection of shells lent by Dr Cox who is well known for his interest in zoology  the specimens are not named but the catalogue gives their localities The Straits Settlements court is badly lighted and appears to be cramped for space this must explain why the really valuable collection of fish made by Dr Rowell of Singapore has been placed on the wall with an eye rather to decorative effect than to scientific use Dr Rowells collec tion contains also some good Crustacea among which we notice a wellpreserved example of the palm or robber crab Birgus latro the airbreath ing apparatus of which has been described by Professor Semper In the neighboring court of British Guiana we were most struck with the collection of nests of wasps bees and ants but it is a pity that little information is given as to the species by which they were severally constructed In the court of the Bahamas there is a wonder ful collection of more than sixty specimens of Oreaster reticulatus which offers the zoologist an opportunity for making a careful inquiry into the range of variation of this species There are four six and seven rayed forms as well as the more ordinary quinquiradiate specimens In the Barbadoes court there is an exceedingly interesting exhibit in the two specimens of Holopus rangi which are lent by Sir Rawson Rawson This very rare crinoid described in 1837 by DOrbigny was incompletely known till Dr Herbert Carpenter gave an account of the three specimens obtained by Sir Rawson when governor of the Windward Islands and one in the possession of the Museum of comparative zoology at Cambridge Mass in his report on the stalked crinoids of the Challenger expedition Holopus has been personally seen by so few naturalists that they will be glad to have an op portunity of inspecting this enigmatic form for themselves it is appropriately placed in a jar with a specimen of Pentacrinus muelleri and as that jar has flat sides instead of being round the visitor will be able to see the specimens free from the distortion which is inseparable from a rounded jar VOL VIII No 178 In the Natal court there is a large collection of Lepidoptera and other insects in drawers and a collection of birds which have we believe been examined by Captain Shelley who is an authority on the avifauna of Africa There is also a large case of insects in drawers in the Straits Settle ments court which have no doubt been examined by Mr Distant The dugong in the Queensland court is if our memory serves us rightly a finer example than either shown by New South Wales in 1883 here too is a fine sawfish The trophy of motherof pearl shells in the West Australian court is im pressive As to the spat of the pearl oyster shown in the Ceylon court we will only say that the exhibiter is not at one with the authorities of the British museum or with the specimens exhibited in the shell gallery of the Natural his tory department of that institution the small Avicula vexillum is not the young of A furcata A THEORY OF CRIMINALITY IN Italy during the last few decades a number of scientific men mostly physicians have devoted themselves to a careful study of criminal types Their point of view is a strictly scientific one they regard a crime as the expression of a danger ous trait of character The character is more im portant than the act Moreover the criminal is not a spontaneous capricious product he does not stand alone but belongs to a class Thus the anthropology of the criminal classes becomes a distinct object of study Again criminality is essentially a morbid phenomenon and is a defect analogous to insanity or idiocy In this aspect the criminal is a psychological study To characterize the spirit of this movement in a few words one may say that it lays stress on the criminal rather than on the crime Foremost among the representatives of this view is Dr Lombroso the editor of a journal devoted to this movement and author of a comprehensive work on the defective classes luomo delinquente Dr Lombroso has recently stated his theory of criminality in a review article Nouvelle revue May 1886 and it may be worth while to take advantage of this convenient statement by pre senting it to English readers In general one may recognize three types of causes of the outbreaks against the social order physical social and anthropological Among the first may be mentioned climate In the Argentine Republic the sharp changes of temperature favor a revolutionary character in the inhabitants The season of year influences the amount of crime crime predominates in the warm months Of 192JULY 2 1886 SCIE1 revolutions in Europe the months of June and July have the largest share November and January the smallest So too heat is a factor Southern countries Italy Spain Greece have the largest number of revolutions northern countries Russia Sweden Norway have the least Geo graphical position and other physical causes could be added As social causes Dr Lombroso regards the struggle for supremacy among the various social castes or classes a disharmony between the existing civilization and the prevalent economic conditions an opposition between the political forms and the national feeling and needs Such are the more constant occasions of revolutionary outbreaks as shown in history Mere accidental circumstances such as the appearance of a great leader or writer must also be considered Finally the following are the prominent an thropological causes the coexistence of races not readily assimilated with perphaps a tendency to political changes hereditary anomalies of charac ter such as criminality and moral insanity or acquired anomalies as alcoholism and insanity All these go to form three classes of political de fectives  criminals by heredity by habit and by mental disease These have furnished the sub jectmatter to the new science of criminal an thropology One must not suppose that because these crimi nals are classed under the insane they will not be active in political crimes for though they may be men of small intellect yet the absence of the re straining power of a welldeveloped moral sense makes the bridge between thought and action shorter and smoother A mere fanciful concep tion of possible crimes will take so strong a hold on their minds that the act itself will follow More sensible and reflecting criminals would be repelled by the consequences and dangers of the act In addition to this class of criminals who become breakers of the peace simply because that happens to be the most accessible method of vent ing their perverse instincts there is another class who are led on by a wild passion for the destruc tion of the old and the creation of something new They need restless activity their present condition seems the worst possible As a rule too they are very fond of notoriety They are in love with crime The pain of others is a keen satisfaction to them its horror attracts them The French revolution shows such types Le jeune made a little guillotine and used it on the chickens destined for his table Jean dHeron wore a human ear as a cockade on his hat and had others in his pockets Carrier confessed that the writhings of the priests whom he condemned to torture gave him exquisite pleasure OCE 21 The modern socialists anarchists and dynamit ers no doubt contain an element of these heredi tary criminals who use the political object as a mask for their instinctive tendencies to lawless outbreaks The socialistic and the criminal types of face present strong resemblances In some cases the introduction of such a criminal element trans forms a purely political organization into a band of outlaws the MollyMaguires are an example of this All these facts urge the study of these defective classes Society has a right to defend itself against these enemies of all peace and progress But the punishment must be directed to the removal of the evil The born criminal can readily be detected his craniological peculiarities the absence of a moral sense the reckless cruelty of his deeds point him out The treatment for these must aim at removing all opportunities of indulging their passions for meeting others of their kind for the epidemic contagion of this disease is one of its worst characteristics for bringing into the world others fated to follow in their footsteps For their children houses of correction and careful discipline should be at hand The relation between insanity and crime is one both of cause and of effect Esquirol has shown an increase of insanity and suicides at each out break of the French revolution Lumier declares that the excitements of 1870 and 1871 were the more or less indirect causes of seventeen hundred cases of insanity This simply means that the same morbid element tending to pronounced in sanity in one direction and to pronounced crimi nality in another is brought to the front by a common cause Very frequently too both ten dencies can be seen in the same individuals Marat for example had attacks of maniacal ex altation and a passion for continually scribbling He had a sloping forehead was prognathous had a prominent jaw and high cheek bones and a hag gard eye all of which correspond closely with the insane type of face Later his delusion of ambi tion changed into one of persecution and homi cidal monomania Dr Lombroso cites case after case all telling the same story He includes Guiteau in this list and agrees with the opinion of an Italian alienist that his trial was simply  scandalous The real place for such beings is in a much needed institution an asylum for insane criminals A few words as to criminals who have acquired their sinful traits Alcohol is the most common cause This always plays a prominent role in po litical outbreaks the French revolution is no ex ception Here is another great practical problem needing solution22 SCE So very hasty a sketch of an important theory is necessarily unsatisfactory It may serve how ever to call attention to the fact that a change in our view of crime and criminals seems about to take place The several interests involved in this change of view are many and important When a chemist is called to court to give expert testimony the law accepts the results of science as final but when the doctor testifies it is at once evident that the medical and legal points of view are essentially different and in conflict with one another The law is interested only in the question of responsi bility and demands a yes or no when a truly scientific answer cannot be given in that form A medico  legal case almost always presents strange inconsistencies The law should certainly be as ready to accept the testimony of science from the doctor as from the chemist and should remember that they may both be equally valuable though not equally definite If such views as these urged by Dr Lombroso ever become the guiding principles of the law courts a great and beneficial change in the treatment of alleged insane criminals is sure to follow Our knowledge of these marked classes is becoming sufficiently ac curate and scientific to warrant a practical appli cation of these views in the legal trials and a theoretical appreciation of them in our theories of ethics J JASTROW ANNALS OF THE CAKCHIQUELS THE above forms the sixth volume of the editors Library of aboriginal literature and contains a portion of a manuscript termed by Brasseur de Bourbourg its former proprietor Memorial de Tecpan Atitlan Its language is the Cakchiquel dialect of the widespread Maya family it was composed by various members of the Xahila a clan or family once ruling among that tribe dur ing the sixteenth century and brought into its pres ent form as Dr Brinton assumes between 1620 and 1650 Only that half of the manuscript was published by him with translation which refers directly to the legendary and documentary history of the tribe There are three ways open for the publication of linguistic manuscripts of this sort The first is to print the text tel quel with all its faults and inconsistencies the second to emend the faulty text according to the grammatic laws observable in the language and to place the readings of the original where they differ from the corrected forms on the lower margin A third mode of The annals of the Cakchiquels By DANIEL G BRINTON Philadelphia Brinton 1885 8 72YJE VOL VIII No 178 proceeding and the most scientific of all would be to embark for Guatemala and there to compare the old text with the pronunciation and wording which the actual Cakchiquels would give to it This would enable the editor not only to present the text in a scientific alphabet but also to add a correct translation to it But none of these three courses was followed by our editor The inconsistent orthography of the original prompted him to adopt the first two courses simultaneously and eclectically and thus he succeeded in producing confusion in the text His excuse p 63 is l I have felt myself free to exercise in the

we can understand the text and the condition of the vocabulary is very unsatisfactory We look in vain for the terms petebal navipe onohel ganel the name of a month and even some of the frequently

quicksilver brass expands so that if one side only is amalgamated a plate of brass becomes curved They imagine that this may be the primary cause of the phe nomena of the Japanese magic mirror which has cast on its back a pattern that is quite invisi ble on the polished face yet is mysteriously dis tinct in the patch of light reflected by the mirror upon a screen Amalgamation would affect the thinner parts made by the pattern more than the rest of the plate giving the mirror the impercep tible unevenness that becomes plainly apparent in the reflected image

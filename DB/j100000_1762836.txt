although their com bination may represent the sounds of words correctly It is true that children can be easily taught to read phonetics but as one who has learned a foreign language lays it aside in his native land so does the phonetic expert for the printed matter he finds in daily use and the language floats on unchanged and stationary How much then is it wise to attempt Can any changes be proposed acceptable to readers and such that printers will use them  Instead of attempting to introduce a phonetic system that is perfect it may be well to employ one that is practical and better than that at present in use but not differing from it enough to em barrass the reader and to keep words of uniform spelling if the correct sound of the letters in them is misused No new letters should be used nor does the eye tolerate new symbols nor the use of accents to determine sounds This narrows the field in which changes can be made yet leaves it large enough to furnish a spelling that will recommend itself to printers foreigners and illiterates while children instinctively adopt it when they can escape from the tyranny of the spellingbook because it is uniform and regulated by analogy First as regards the vowelsounds There seems to be no good reason to change the short sound of a Its sound as in Zrade is fixed by e mute in all words except four Its sound as in marry is fixed by the double consonant  Glossic  doubles a infaSer and adds S in raZer Short e need not be changed It is length ened when it is in a final syllable or followed by e mute which Professor Marsh tells us requires four per cent of all printed mat ter  Glossic  uses ei for long  which does not displease the eye Of the four sounds of o that as in Zone is controlled by e mute or by accent in pronunciation The sound as in move occurs in twelve words which may be memorized Words with the sound as in dove might perhaps drop e mute The bAe rozre ou with its seven sounds has already caused a rebellion as in pZow for the timehonored pZougS and may gradually drop most of them Of the consonants c is hard before a o  which can easily be remembered as it will be difficult to displace it by k g has both hard and soft sounds before e and z wherej could be substituted asienuzze There would be few mourners at its burial should the Frinters condescend to drop S after iq The change to zon for shun is displeasing and its pronunciation is uniform The print ing atAzs for Azs is a stumblingblock in the way of any change The changes noted above arc the principal ones that would go far to conform the spelling of the language to its pronunciation Perhaps the best way to have any changes adopted would be to have the most desirable printed on cards to be kept in plain sight at every case of type and have some editor who has the improve ment of the language at heart print one article in his daily paper with the approved spelling If it is favorably received increase it gradually as the readers approve it The end can be gained by keep ing the changes before the eye until they are accepted by habit W C Bryant used to say  When you reformers agree among youlselves as to what you want it will be time enough for us of the press to give the matter our attention It cannot now be said that there is uncertainty as to the proposed reform The action of the phonological societies the efforts of linguists the whole literature of phtnetics furnish a magazine to supply all that is needed to move upon the conservative forces that delay reform But the press should take the initiative for with little effort they can make it familiar to every reader and give it success The re sults on the brotherhood of mankind will be such that every one who is in a position to forward the reform should take an active share in its introduction M LETTERS TO THE EDITOR The United States their Growth in Population in Two Hundred Years The following letter was received from the Hon W E Gladstone in response to a copy of Science mailed him containing Gen M C Meigss article on the above subject sDL A X X 9  XgL S  L2d w A HX 4ws    wXksA wA  4 sWG g X e9 Vatz A7 X k Wf t F prGt y The Pennsylvania Weather Review THE monthly weather review of the Pennsylvania State Weather Service for August last contains an isothermal map of the State for the normals of the month whose atrocious absurdity is paralleled only by the isothermal maps of New Hampshire in the report on the geology of that State several years ago The isotherm of 67 performs the extraordinary feat of branching three times in its traverse of Pennsylvania Three other isotherms end abruptly within the limits of the State apparently not knowing how to get out The lobate isotherm of 7I that enters the State from the south and includes Gettysburg fails to surround the adjacent iso therm of 74 which reaches Harrisburg It is remarkable that a travesty like this should appear under the direction of the commit tee on meteorology of the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia W Reformed Spelling So far all attempts to introduce a reformation in spelling seem to have failed The changes that are recommended by the philo logical societies and approved by scholars are disregarded Mr Elliss  Glossic  has been before the public nearly twenty years Dr Hills efforts for six years at Waltham produced no permanent effect it is doubtful if Mr Bells  World English  will fare better and Hosea Bigelow spelling is dropped by every one after they have wearied themselves over a few lines While so much study has been given to the changes that are desirable the best way to introduce them has perhaps been less INDUSTRIAL NOTES Electric Apparatus for South Africa OUR readers are well acquainted with the many electricrailway installations which have been made during the past two years and with the fact that the manufacture of electric apparatus for this work has grown rapidly It is now estimated that there are from I50 tO zoo eleetric streetrailways in this eountry either in opera tion or in eourse of eonstruetion Electricity promises to be the coming medium for transmission of power not only for streetrailways but also for mining indus tries and it is hard to imagine an agent for transmitting power which is more easily handled and the apparatus for which is on the whole more economical and inexpensive Among the electric mining plants which are now being installed by American rnanufacturers of electric apparatus who lead the rest of the world are a number not only in this country but SCIESCIFNCEs  242 abroad and it is no unusual thing to hear of another mining com pany which has decided to adopt electric power in its mines Among recent contracts which have been awarded the Sprague Electric Railway and Motor Company of New York for electric mining apparatus is one which comes from Transvaal South Africa and it is interesting to note that the fame for American electricmining apparatus for durahility economy and convenience is recognized in these fields as well as in this country  The com pany which is now installing Sprague apparatus in Transvaal is the ForbesReef GoldMining Company who have ordered through Chester  Gibb mining engineers of London Eng a complete electrical equipment for transmitting power including four Sprague longdistance motors and dynamos for transmitting I4o horse power over a distance of three miles The primal source of power is a waterfall situated about three miles distant from the mines as the crow flies These points are connected by insulated wires which are carried on poles At the powerstation will be placed three Pelton wheels fur nished by Frazer  Chalmers of Chicago To each of two of these wheels will be belted one longdistance transmission constant po tential Edison dynamo of 50ooo watts or 67 horsepower capacity each To the other wheel will be belted a dynamo of the same type and voltage as the others but of only 40000 watts or 55 horsepower capacity These dynamos are similar in appearance to the standard Edison dynamo which is used in incandescent lighting but their winding is modified according to the regular Sprague system adapting them for the longdistance transmission of power These machines have an efficiency of over 95 per cent At the mines are located the four Sprague motors which are belted direct to the miningmachinery These motors are divided into two groups two zo horsepower Sprague motors and one 80 horsepower motor forming one group and a single 20 horsepower Sprague motor forming the other group Each group is supplied with current by a separate set of wires thus practically insuring a constant flow of electricity under all circumstances The method of regulating the motors and keeping up a constant speed in spite of the varying loads thrown on the miningmachinery is accomplished by winding the motors in a special way so that there is no mechanical governor to get out of order The governor being in the winding and consequently acting without making any movement the motors are more durable and the use of any com plicated mechanical governor is avoided The motors are to run on a constant potential circuit and all the motors of each group are connected together from positive to negative wires thus equal izing the strain on the dynamos when the loads are thrown on the motors This method of connecting dynamos and motors is in use in all Sprague stations for the transmission of power and it is much superior in reliability and economy to the series method of putting each motor on a separate connection In principle it is the same as supplying a city with water by running city mains instead of using a separate conductor for each consumer The question of efficiency or the amount of the primal power which is delivered at the farther end after the transmission is one which is very important Upon this point electric transmission compares very favorably with all other methods of transmitting power In this case the efficiency of the entire system from the turbine pulley to the miningmachines at the farther end is about 70 per cent that is 70 per cent of the energy which is delivered from the turbine pulleys at the powerstation is given off the motor pulleys for work New Electric StreetRailways DURING the last week there have been a number of streetrail way companies which have contracted for electricrailway appa ratus in spite of the lateness of the season The latest contracts closed by the Sprague Electric Railway and Motor Company of New York are for streetrailways in Piqua 0 and South Nash ville Tenn The road at Piqua is an entirely new road never having been operated by any power before The number of cars which will be equipped will be four and the line will extend for a few miles on the main streets of Piqua The South Nashville Street Railway Company will equip eight tVoL XIV No 348 cars at present but it is expected that the entire road will be run by electric power before long The Elliott NonElectric Telephone A PATENT was recently issued to Larkin V Elliott of Moores town Ind for an improved form of mechanical or nonelectric telephone which seems to possess several advantages over other instruments of its class The general appearance of this telephone is shown in the accompanying illustration The mouthpiece is bellshaped and about four inches in diameter at its larger part the bore narrowing to about an inch and a quarter where it joins the base The aperture in the latter is coneshaped narrowing from about four inches in diameter where it joins the mouthpiece to half that size at the rear Between the mouthpiece and the base the diaphragm is securely fastened The diaphragm consists of two sheets of stretched rawhide with an interposed layer of soft fibrous material and a covering of some soft fabric It is made in the following manner A sheet of thick rawhide is first stretched tightly across the aperture in the base preferably while wet so that when it dries it will be still more tightly drawn Over this is laid a layer of cotton batting or other soft fibrous material Over this a sheet of thin rawhide is stretched but not as tightly as the first sheet Lastly comes a sheet of velveteen The whole is se cured firmly between the base and mouthpiece The linewire passes through an opening in the centre of the diaphragm being provided on its end with a button which bears against the velveteen surface of the diaphragm The inventor claims that this peculiar construction of the diaphragm together with the shapes of the apertures in the base and mouthpiece not only prevent the usual roaring sound in the receiver but improve the sound by rendering it more distinct reproducing a clear natu ral tone of voice similar to that which acts upon the diaphragm at the other end of the linewire The claims of the inventor in regard to the good qualities of these telephones are borne out by the testimonials of many busi nessmen who have had them in use for several lnonths They are intended only for short lines from a few rods up to a couple of miles Proper suspension devices are provided so that the line wire may be carried around angles without impairing the efficiency of the instruments An electric callbell may be used in connection with this telephone if desired American Apparatus in Italy WORK on the electricrailway apparatus for the Florence and Fiesole Road has been commenced upon at Schenectady NYwhich will be ready for shipment before long This road will be operated entirely by electric power and Sprague electric cars will be used throughout the entire line The road connects the city of Florence with the city of Fiesole a distance of about five miles The grades upon this line will be very severe sufficiently so to have precluded the use of horses upon it The regular Sprague system of overhead wires using main conductor with feeders will be used The fact that American railway apparatus have been adopted on this line is extremely flattering to the company to whom the order is given and gratifying to the patriotism of every American The fact that the Sprague system was brought into direct competition in the matter of equipment of this road with all the systems of electric streetrailways in Europe shows in an additional way tbe favorable reputation of Amencan apparatus

J100688,ABSTRACTS OF THE PAPERS PRINTED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,109821,EXPERIMENTS ON THE DEPOLARIZATION OF LIGHT AS EXHIBITED BY VARIOUS MINERAL ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE BODIES WITH A REFERENCE OF THE PHENOMENA TO THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF POLARIZATION ABSTRACT,I207044,4 EXPERIMENTS ON THE DEPOLARIZATION OF LIGHT AS EXHIBITED BY VARIOUS MINERAL ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE BODIES WITH A REFERENCE OF THE PHE NOMENA TO THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF POLARIZATION BYDAVID BREWSTER LLD FRS EDIN AND FSA EDIN IN A LETTER ADDRESSED TO THE RIGHT HON SIR JOSEPH BANKS BART KB PRS READ DE CEMBER 15 1814 PHIL TRANS 1815 P 29 WHEN A RAY OF LIGHT HAS BEEN SO MODIFIED BY REFLECTION OR REFRACTION THAT IN CERTAIN PLANES IT IS NOT DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS BY A PRISM OF ICELAND SPAR THAT RAY IS SAID TO BE POLARIZED BUT IT MAY AGAIN BY SEVERAL MEANS BE RENDERED DIVISIBLE AND IS THEN SAID TO BE DEPOLA RIZED THE OBJECT OF THE AUTHOR IN THIS LETTER IS TO COMPRISE EXPE RIMENTS ON THE DEPOLARIZING PROPERTIES OF A GREAT VARIETY OF SUBSTANCES AT THE SAME TIME AND THENCE TO DEDUCE THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES ON WHICH THE VARIOUS DEGREES OR MODES IN WHICH THEY EXHIBIT THIS PRO PERTY DEPEND DR BREWSTER HAS ALREADY IN A FORMER COMMUNICATION DESCRIBED THE GENERAL PHENOMENA OF DEPOLARIZATION BY MICA CALCAREOUS SPAR TOPAZ AND OTHER REGULARLY CRYSTALLIZED BODIES WHICH HAVE TWO NEUTRAL AXES AT RIGHT ANGLES TO EACH OTHER AND TWO DEPOLARIZING AXES ALSO AT RIGHT ANGLES TO EACH OTHER BUT MAKING ANGLES OF 450 WITH EACH OF THE NEUTRAL AXES OF THE BODIES NOW ENUMERATED BY THE AUTHOR SOME HAVE NO POLA RIZING OR DEPOLARIZING PROPERTIES AS ROCK SALT FLUOR SPAR AND SPINELLE RUBY OUT OF SEVEN SPECIMENS OF DIAMOND FOUR DID NOT DEPOLARIZE ONE DEPOLARIZED ABOUT ONE FIFTH OF THE LIGHT ONE ABOUT ONE HALF AND ONE NEARLY ALL THE LIGHT IN EVERY POSITION THE NEXT CLASS OF BODIES SUBJECTED TO EXPERIMENT BY THE AUTHOR ARE VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL SUBSTANCES FROM WHICH HE EXPECTS TO DE DUCE IMPORTANT CONCLUSIONS GUM ARABIC DEPOLARIZES LIGHT IN EVERY POSITION UNLESS IN EXTREMELY THIN CHIPS CHERRY GUM ALSO DEPOLARIZES LIGHT WITH SOME APPEARANCE OF A NEUTRAL AXIS CAOUTCHOUC HAS THE SAME PROPERTY AND THOUGH IT LOSES IT WHEN FUSED BY HEAT IT RECOVERS THE SAME POWER GRADUALLY IN THE COURSE OF A FEW WEEKS WHITE WAX MELTED BETWEEN TWO PLATES OF GLASS DEPOLARIZES IN EVERY POSITION BEES WAX HAS THE SAME PROPERTY AS MAY BE EXHIBITED BY INCLOSING A PORTION OF A CELL OF A HONEYCOMB BETWEEN LAYERS OF CANADA BALSAM MANNA CAMPHOR AND BALSAM OF TOLU WERE TRIED WITH THE SAME RESULTS VARIOUS FIBROUS VEGETABLE SUBSTANCES HAVE ALSO THE PROPERTY OF DEPOLARIZING BUT HAVE NEUTRAL AXES IN THE DIRECTION OF THEIR FIBRES ADIPOCIRE FROM VARIOUS SOURCES SPERMACETI AND SOUPS OF ALL SORTS DEPOLARIZE IN EVERY POSITION VARIOUS KINDS OF HAIR WOOL FEATHER AND SILK DEPOLARIZE BUT HAVE NEUTRAL AXES IN THE DIRECTION OF THEIR LENGTH AND AT RIGHT ANGLES TO IT HUMAN CUTICLE HUMAN NAIL AND VARIOUS KINDS OF HORN THE CORNEA OF THE EYE OF A MAN COW OR FISH A PIECE OF BLADDER ISINGLASS OR GLUE DEPOLARIZE IN ALL POSITIONS CERTAIN OTHER ANIMAL SUBSTANCES WHICH ARE DISTINCTLY FIBROUS IN ONE DIRECTION EXHIBIT NEUTRAL AXES IN5 THAT DIRECTION AND AT RIGHT ANGLES TO IT THOUGH THEY DEPOLARIZE IN OTHER DIRECTIONS ACETATE OF LEAD CONFUSEDLY CRYSTALLIZED BETWEEN TWO PLATES OF GLASS DEPOLARIZES IN ALL POSITIONS PLATES OF ICE HAVE IN GENERAL THE SAME EFFECT THOUGH SOME EXHIBIT NEUTRAL AXES OIL OF MACE BEING A SOFT SOLID OPAKE FROM CONFUSED CRYSTALLIZATION DEPOLARIZES ALSO IN ALL POSITIONS BUT IT ALSO EXHIBITS THROUGH A VERY THIN MARGIN A PECULIARITY NOT OBSERVED IN ANY OF THE PRECEDING EX PERIMENTS WHEN THE FLAME OF A CANDLE IS VIEWED THROUGH IT THE FLAME APPEARS SURROUNDED BY A HALO BUT IF THE LIGHT BE POLARIZED BEFORE IT IS TRANSMITTED THROUGH THE OIL OF MACE THEN THE FLAME HAS FOUR WINGS OR LUMINOUS RADIATIONS AT RIGHT ANGLES TO EACH OTHER AND ACCORDINGLY IF TWO PENCILS OF LIGHT BE RECEIVED AT THE SAME TIME BY TRANSMISSION THROUGH ICELAND SPAR THEN THERE ARE TWO SUCH IMAGES WITH THEIR FOUR WINGS TRANSVERSELY SITUATED SO THAT THE RAYS OF ONE IMAGE CORRESPOND IN POSITION WITH THE BLANK SPACES OF THE OTHER A SLICE OF TORTOISESHELL WHICH ALSO DEPOLARIZES IN EVERY POSITION EXHIBITS ALSO BY THE POLARIZED LIGHT OF A CANDLE FAINT LUMINOUS RAYS SIMILAR TO THOSE SEEN BY OIL OF MACE THE AUTHOR NEXT CLASSES THESE BODIES ACCORDING TO THE VARIOUS DE GREES IN WHICH THEY MORE OR LESS PERFECTLY DEPOLARIZE AND MORE OR LESS PERFECTLY POSSESS NEUTRAL AXES IN WHICH DEPOLARIZATION DOES NOT TAKE PLACE THE SIMPLEST CASE OF DEPOLARIZATION IS THAT EFFECTED BY A THIN PLATE OF ICELAND SPAR OR OTHER REGULARLY CRYSTALLIZED BODY THE PRINCIPAL SECTION OF WHICH IS NOT IN THE PLANE OF POLARIZATION OR AT RIGHT ANGLES TO IT AND CONSEQUENTLY OCCASIONS THE POLARIZED RAY TO BE SUBDIVIDED INTO TWO OTHERS TRANSVERSELY POLARIZED ACCORDING TO THE ORIGINAL OB SERVATION OF HUYGENS HENCE IF OTHER BODIES AS HAIR WOOL SILK C HAVE NEUTRAL AXES OR PLANES IN WHICH A TRANSMITTED RAY RETAINS ITS POLARIZATION WHILE IT IS DEPOLARIZED IN OTHER POSITIONS THIS AFFORDS OP TICAL EVIDENCE OF THE REGULARITY OF THEIR INTERNAL TEXTURE AND THOUGH THEY CANNOT BE CALLED DOUBLY REFRACTING CRYSTALS YET THE AUTHOR CON CEIVES THAT THEY FORM TWO IMAGES WHICH ARE COINCIDENT BUT DIFFER ENTLY POLARIZED AND ACCORDINGLY THAT THESE BODIES SHOULD BE CALLED DOUBLY POLARIZING CRYSTALS OTHER BODIES ON THE CONTRARY LIKE THE CONFUSEDLY CRYSTALLIZED ACE TATE OF LEAD HAVING AXES IN ALL DIRECTIONS PRESENT NO NEUTRAL AXES BUT DEPOLARIZE IN EVERY DIRECTION WHILE OTHERS ACCORDING TO THA DE GREE OF THEIR CRYSTALLINE TEXTURE HAVE THE PROPERTY OF DEPOLARIZING A GREATER OR LESS PROPORTION OF THE INCIDENT LIGHT OR ACCORDING TO THE DEGREE OF REGULARITY OF THAT TEXTURE MAY EXHIBIT SOME APPEARANCE OF NEUTRAL AXES WITH REGARD TO OIL OF MACE DR BREWSTER OBSERVES THAT SINCE THE CONTINUOUS HALO WHICH SURROUNDS THE FLAME OF A CANDLE SEEN THROUGH IT IS DIVIDED BY REFRACTION THROUGH A PRISM OF ICELAND SPAR INTO TWO SETS OF LUMINOUS RADIATIONS SURROUNDING THE TWO FLAMES SEEN THROUGH IT HAVING THE LUMINOUS RAYS OF THE ONE CORRESPONDING IN POSITION TO THE VACANT SPACES OF THE OTHER HE INFERS THAT THE HALO ITSELF IN FACT6 CONSISTS OF EIGHT LUMINOUS OCTANTS ALTERNATELY POLARIZED IN A DIFFERENT MANNER AND OBSERVES THAT IF WE KNEW IN WHAT WAY THE HALO IS FORMED THERE WOULD PROBABLY BE NO DIFFICULTY IN EXPLAINING THESE RE INARKABLE PHENOMENA ON AN EBBING AND FLOWING STREAM DISCOVERED BY BORING IN THE HARBOUR OF BRIDLINGTON BY JOHN STORER MD COMMUNICATED BY THE RIGHT HON SIR JOSEPH BANKS BART KB PRS READ JANUARY 19 1815 PHIL TRANS 1815 P 54 IN THE YEAR 1811 WITH A VIEW TO MAKING CERTAIN IMPROVEMENTS IN THE PORT OF BRIDLINGTON AN EXAMINATION WAS MADE OF THE DEPTH OF A STRATUM OF CLAY AND ANOTHER OF GRAVEL AT SOME DISTANCE BELOW HIGH WATER MARK AT LOW WATER THE HARBOUR IS DRY AND AT HIGH WATER IT HAS FROM FIFTEEN TO SEVENTEEN FEET OF WATER IN THE DEEPEST PART THE SPOT FIXED UPON FOR BORING HAS ABOUT SIX FEET OF WATER IN ORDINARY TIDES AFTER BORING THROUGH 28 FEET OF CLAY AND SUBSEQUENTLY THROUGH A MIXED STRATUM OF CHALK AND GRAVEL THE AUGUR WAS FOUND TO STRIKE AGAINST A SOLID ROCK ON WHICH THAT INSTRUMENT COULD MAKE NO IM PRESSION AND THE WORK WAS DISCONTINUED WITHOUT ANY APPEARANCE OF WATER AT THAT TIME RISING IN THE BORE BUT IN THE COURSE OF AN HOUR OR TWO IT WAS OBSERVED TO BE FILLED TO THE TOP WITH VERY LIMPID FRESH WATER WHICH AFTER A SHORT TIME WAS PROJECTED SOME INCHES ABOVE THE SUMMIT IN A STREAM EQUAL TO ITS CALIBRE AS THE WATER WAS FOUND TO BE FIT FOR WASHING AND ALL CULINARY PURPOSES THE BORE WAS FIRST SECURED BY AN ELM STOCK TEN FEET LONG AND PERFORATED WITH A THREE INCH AUGUR THROUGH WHICH WAS PASSED A COPPER TUBE OF THE SAME DIAMETER WELL TINNED TO THE DEPTH OF 32 FEET AND WHICH THUS REACHED FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE ELM STOCK TO THE SOLID ROCK IN ORDER TO PRE SERVE A SUPPLY OF WATER FOR THE USE OF THE TOWN THE STREAM HOWEVER IS FOUND NOT TO BE CONSTANT BUT TO CEASE RE GULARLY WHEN THE TIDE HAS FALLEN TO A CERTAIN DISTANCE AND NOT TO FLOW AGAIN TILL THE TIDE RETURNS TO THE SAME LEVEL ITS FORCE INCREASING REGU LARLY AS THE TIDE ADVANCES AND IT MAY BE OBSERVED TO BE PROPELLED WITH MUCH FORCE EVEN AFTER THE BORE IS OVERFLOWED BY THE TIDE BY ATTENTION TO THE HEIGHT OF THE TIDE AT THE TIME THAT THE WATER BEGINS TO FLOW IT IS FOUND TO BE VERY REGULARLY 49 OR 50 INCHES BELOW THE LEVEL OF THE TOP OF THE BORE EXCEPTING AFTER ANY VERY UNUSUAL FALL OF RAIN WHEN THE WATER HAS BEEN KNOWN TO FLOW EVEN WHEN THE TIDE HAS FALLEN AS MUCH AS EIGHT FEET BELOW THE TOP OF THE BORE THESE APPEARANCES SAYS THE AUTHOR SEEM NOT TO ADMIT OF ANY SA TISFACTORY EXPLANATION WITHOUT SUPPOSING SOME SUBTERRANEOUS COM MUNICATION BETWEEN THE WATER OF THE SEA AND THAT OF THE SPRING AND MR MILNE UNDER WHOSE DIRECTION THE WORK HAS BEEN CONDUCTED CON CEIVES THE STRATUM OF CLAY THROUGH WHICH THE WATER ISSUES TO EXTEND OVER THE WHOLE BAY IN FRONT OF THE HARBOUR AS FAR AS TO SMITHWICK SAND WHICH IS KNOWN TO BE SUPPORTED BY A LEDGE OF ROCK THAT HAS AN ALMOST PERPENDICULAR FACE AND VERY DEEP WATER BEYOND IT IT IS

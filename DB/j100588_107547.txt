J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107547,ON SOME COMBINATIONS OF PLATINUM,I206975,C 108 VI ON SOME COMBINATIONS OF PLATINUM BY EDMUND DAVY ESQ PROFESSOR OF CHEMISTRY AND SECRETARY TO THE CORK INSTITU TION COMMUNICATED BY F BABINGTON M D F R S READ FEBRUARY 17 1820 IN MY COMMUNICATION TO SIR H DAVY BART ON A NEW FUL MINATING PLATINUM WHICH HAS BEEN HONOURED WITH A PLACE IN THE TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY I STATED THAT I HAD OB TAINED SOME OTHER NEW COMPOUNDS OF THIS METAL THESE HAVE SINCE OCCUPIED NO INCONSIDERABLE PORTION OF MY LEISURE HOURS AND I NOW BEG LEAVE TO LAY THE RESULTS OF MY INQUIRY BEFORE THE ROYAL SOCIETY A CONSTANT ATTENTION TO OTHER NECESSARY DUTIES HAS NOT ALLOWED ME SUFFICIENT TIME TO RENDER THIS INVES TIGATION SO COMPLETE AS I COULD HAVE WISHED BUT AS I PRE SUME THE FACTS ARE NOVEL I SHALL VENTURE TO BRING THEM FOR WARD IN A FORM WHICH THOUGH IMPERFECT MAY NOT BE WHOLLY DESTITUTE OF INTEREST I ON A PECULIAR COMPOUND OF PLATINUM OBTAINEDFROM SULPHATE OF PLATINUM BY THE AGENCY OF ALCOHOL SULPHATE OF PLATINUIM UNLIKE THE OTHER METALLIC SULPHATES IN GENERAL IS TO A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT SOLUBLE IN ALCOHOL AND IN ETHER AS THESE FLUIDS ARE CAPABLE IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OF PARTIALIV OR WHOLLY REVIVING SOME METALLIC OXIDES FROM THEIR SOLUTIONS IN ACIDS I WISHED TO TRY THEIR EFFECTS ON THE SULPHATE OF PLATINUM ACCORDINGLY I PUT INTO A SMALL PHIAL  PHIL TRANS 1817MR DAVY ON SOME COMBINATIONS OF PLATINUM P ABOUT EQUAL VOLUMES OF A STRONG AQUEOUS SOLUTION OF THE SULPHATE AND ALCOHOL AND AFTER AGITATING THE MIXED FLUIDS THE PHIAL WAS PUT ASIDE SOME WEEKS AFTERWARDS I FOUND THE DARK COLOUR OF THE SULPHATE HAD ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED A DENSE BLACK SUBSTANCE HAD SUBSIDED AND THE SUPERNATANT FLUID RE MAINED COLOURLESS AND TRANSPARENT ON OPENING THE PHIAL AN ODOUR SIMILAR TO THAT OF ETHER WAS PERCEIVED THE FLUID HAD A STRONG ACID TASTE AND AFFBRDED A COPIOUS PRECIPITATE WITH NITRATE OF BARYTES AFTER THE BLACK SUBSTANCE HAD BEEN WELL WASHED AND DRIED A FEW PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTS SERVED TO SHOW THAT IT WAS A PECULIAR COMPOUND WHICH HAD NOT BEEN NOTICED TO CONFIRM THESE RESULTS AND PROCURE MORE OF THE SUBSTANCE I REPEATED THE EXPERIMENT WITH THE SULPHATE AND ALCOHOL IN ABOUT TWO DAYS THE FLUID ASSUMED A DARKER TINT THE BLACK SUBSTANCE BEGAN TO PRECIPITATE IN A FINELY DIVIDED STATE AND IN ABOUT A WEEK IT HAD ALL SUBSIDED LEAVING THE FLUID COLOURLESS AND TRANSPARENT I AFTERWARDS FOUND THAT THE SUBSTANCE IN QUESTION MAY BE READILY OBTAINED BY BOILING THE SULPHATE AND ALCOHOL TOGETHER FOR A FEW MINUTES IT SE PARATES IN SMALL PARTICLES LEAVING THE SUPERNATANT FLUID CO LOURLESS OR WITH ONLY A SLIGHT TINGE OF YELLOW IN CASES WHEN IT IS THUS PROCURED A LITTLE VOLATILE INFLAMMABLE FLUID HAVING A PECULIAR ETHEREAL SMELL IS ALSO OBTAINED THE SUB STANCE AFTER BEING WASHED TILL THE WATER IS TASTELESS AND DOES NOT AFFECT LITMUS PAPER AND DRIED AT A TEMPERATURE OF ABOUT 250 FAHRENHEIT EXHIBITS THE FOLLOWING PROPERTIES  THE ALCOHOL USED IN THIS EXPERIMENT MAY VARY CONSIDERABLY IN ITS STRENGTH AND QUANTITY WITHOUT MATERIALLY AFFECTING THE RESULTS ETHER MAY ALSO BE EMI PLOYED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR ALCOHOL 109MR DAVY N SM  PROPERES OF TH PECULIAR COMPOUND THE SUBSTANCE IS OF A BLACK COLOUR AND IN SMALL LUMPS WHICH ARE SOFT TO THE TOUCH AND EASILY REDUCED TO AN IMPAL PABLE POWDER IT READILY SOILS THE FINGERS OR PAPER IT IS DESTITUTE OF LUSTRE IT IS TASTELESS AND APPARENTLY UNAFFECTED EITHER BY OLD OR HOT WATER IT HAS A PECULIAR ETHEREAL SMELL THAT IS NOT EASILY REMOVED AND PROBABLY ARISES FROM THE PRE SENCE OF A LITTLE INFLAMMABLE MATTER OCCASIONED BY THE ACTION OF THE ALCOHOL IT SEEMS TO UNDERGO NO CHANGE BY EXPOSURE TO THE AIR FOR SOME TIME WHEN IT IS GENTLY HEATED ON A SLIP OF PLATINUM OR PAPER A HISSING NOISE OR A FEEBLE EXPLOSION IS PRODUCED AND THIS EFFECT IS ACCOMPANIED BY A FLASH OF RED LIGHT AND THE PLATINUM IS REDUCED IT IS INSOLUBLE IN NITROUS SULPHURIC AND PHOSPHORIC ACIDS BUT IT DISSOLVES SLOWLY IN MURIATIC ACID IT IS SCARCELY AFFCTED BY CHLORINE EXCEPT MOISTURE BE PRESENT WHEN A LITTLE MURIATE IS GRADUALLY FORMED WHEN THE POWDER IS PUT INTO LIQUID AMMONIA MINUTE GO BULES OF AIR ARE EVOLVED FROM IT AND AFTER SOME TIME IT AC QUIRES FULMINATING PROPERTIES THE QUANTITY OF AIR I HAVE HITHERTO OBTAINED IN THIS WAY HAS BEEN TOO SMALL TO ALLOW ME TO ASCERTAIN ITS NATURE WITH PRECISION WHEN THE POWDER IS BROUGHT IN CONTACT WITH AMMONIACAL GAS A CRACKLING NOISE IS PRODUCED AND IT BECOMES RED HOT AND SCINTILLATES BUT BY THIS TREATMENT ITS EXTERNAL APPEARANCE IS SCARCELY ALTERED THOUGH IT UNDERGOES A PARTIAL DECOMPOSITION THE POWDER IS IMMEDIATELY DECOMPOSED BY THE AGENCY OF ALCOHOL THIS FACT IS SHOWN IN AN INTERESTING MANNER BY MOISTENING DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES SUCH AS PAPER SAND CORK C WITH ALCOHOL AND PLACING THE SMALLEST PARTICLE OF THE POWDER ON THEM IT HISSES 110COMBINATIONS OFPLATINUM 1I1 A SUFFICIENT DEGREE OF HEAT IS PRODUCED TO REDUCE AND IGNITE THE PLATINUM AND IT REMAINS IN A STATE OF IGNITION UNTIL THE ALCOHOL IS CONSUMED DURING THE AGENCY OF ALCOHOL ON THE POWDER ACETIC ACID IS PRODUCED THIS IS SHOWN BY PUTTING A LITTLE OF THE POWDER ON A PAPER FILTER AND MOISTENING IT WITH ALCOHOL A MODERATE ACTION TAKES PLACE AND IN A FEW MINUTES THE ODOUR OF ACETIC ACID IS VERY PERCEPTIBLE IN SOME EX PERIMENTS OF THIS KIND THE ACTION THOUGH COMPARATIVELY FEE BLE AT FIRST HAS PRESENTLY INCREASED THE POWDER HAS BECOME RED HOT AND THE BOTTOM OF THE FILTER COMPLETELY CHARRED IF TWO OR THREE GRAINS OF THE POWDER ARE PLACED IN A GLASS AND A FEW DROPS OF ALCOHOL ADDED IN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR ACETIC ACID WILL BE PRODUCED AND AS IT EVAPORATES AND DISAPPEARS IT MAY BE SUCCESSIVELY RENEWED AT LONGER OR SHORTER INTERVALS FOR SOME WEEKS BY OCCASIONALLY ADDING A LITTLE ALCOHOL WHEN THE POWDER IS BOILED IN ALCOHOL IT IS PARTIALLY DE COMPOSED AND ASSUMES A LIGHTER COLOUR IF IT BE THEN THROWN ON A FILTER THE ODOUR OF ACETIC ACID IS SOON PERCEIVED AND IN A FEW HOURS THE PLATINUM IS FOUND REDUCED AND THE PAPER CHARRED WHEN THE POWDER IS MIXED WITH FLOWERS OF SULPHUR AND HEATED A SULPHURET OF PLATINUM IS FORMED OF A BLUE CO LOUR WHEN THE POWDER IS HEATED WITH PHOSPHORUS THERE IS A BRILLIANT COMBUSTION AND A DARK GREY PHOSPHORET IS FORMED OXYGEN GAS DOES NOT AFFECT THE POWDER AT THE COMMON TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR BUT BY A MODERATE HEAT THERE IS A SLIGHT COMBUSTION WHICH SEEMS TO INDICATE THE PRE SENCE OF A LITTLE INFLAMMABLE MATTER 3 COMPOSITION OF THE PECULIAR COMPOUND IN MY FIRST ATTEMPTS TO ASCERTAIN THE NATURE OF THE BLACK112 MTR DAVY ON SOME POWDER I WAS LIMITED TO VERY MINUTE QUANTITIES OF IT AND I MADE SEVERAL TRIALS BEFORE I GAINED ANY SATISFACTORY EVIDENCES OF ITS CONSTITUTION I DECOMPOSED THE POWDER IN LONG GREEN GLASS TUBES FILLED WITH MERCURY IN SUCH CASES BY A GENTLE HEAT THE POWDER BECAME IGNITED THE REDUCED PLATINUM AMAL GAMATED WITH THE MERCURY A LITTLE FLUID APPEARED AND SOME GAS WAS EVOLVED THE FLUID REDDENED LITMUS AND HAD AN ACID TASTE THE GAS RENDERED LIME WATER TURBID AND WAS IN PART ABSORBED BY WATER AND BY AMMONIA  AND THE UNABSORBED PORTION EXHIBITED PROPERTIES SIMILAR TO THOSE OF NITROGEN THESE RESULTS SEEMED TO PROVE THAT THE POWDER CONTAINED ACID AND INFLAMMABLE MATTER BUT THEY WERE NOT SUFFICIENTLY UNIFORM TO ENABLE ME TO PLACE MUCH RELIANCE ON THEM I THEN USED VERY SMALL GLASS RETORTS VARYING IN CAPACITY FROM  TO 7 OF A CUBIC INCH AND DECOMPOSED THE POWDER OVER PURE WATER AND OVER MERCURY BUT THE RESULTS WERE MOST SATIS FACTORY WHEN I OPERATED OVER MERCURY FROM TWO EXPERI MENTS OF THIS KIND WHICH I BEG BRIEFLY TO DETAIL AS THEY VERY NEARLY AGREE I THINK I MAY VENTURE TO STATE THE COMPOSITION OF THE POWDER UNDER EXAMINATION EXPERIMENT I TEN GRAINS OF THE POWDER WERE DECOMPOSED IN A LITTLE RETORT OVER DRY MERCURY BY THE HEAT OF A SPIRIT LAMP ON THE FIRST IMPRESSION OF THE HEAT GAS WAS DISENGAGED AND SHORTLY AFTER THE INTERIOR OF THE RETORT ASSUMED A REDDISH YELLOW COLOUR LIKE THAT EXHIBITED BY THE VAPOUR OF FUMING NITROUS ACID AND SMALL DROPS OF A COLOURLESS FLUID CONDENSED IN THE NECK OF THE RETORT AFTER THE UTMOST HEAT OF THE LAMP HAD BEEN GIVEN TO THE RETORT IT WAS SUFFERED TO COOL AND THE RESULTS WERE IMMEDIATELY EXAMINEDCOMBINATIONS OF PLATINUM A EXAMINATION OF THE GAS THE GAS REMAINING IN THE RETORT MADE AN IGNITED PIECE OF WOOD GLOW BRIGHTER THAT WHICH CAME OVER DEDUCTING THE COMMON AIR WAS 5 OF A CUBIC INCH WHICH DIMINISHED TO I ON BEING TRANSFERRED TO WATER AND AGITATED  OF THE UN ABSORBED GAS ON BEING MIXED WITH AN EQUAL VOLUME OF PURE HYDROGEN AND FIRED BY AN ELECTRIC SPARK DIMINISHED TO  HENCE THE UNABSORBED PORTION OF GAS COLLTAINED MORE OXYGEN THAN COULD HAVE BEEN FURNISHED FROM THE COMMON AIR OF THE RETORT FROM OTHER EXPERIMENTS THE GAS ABSORBED BY WATER WAS FOUND TO BE CARBONIC ACID IT RENDERED LIME WATER TURBID WAS ABSORBED BY AMMONIA AND AGAIN DISENGAGED BY MURIATIC ACID B EXAMINATION OF THE FLUID THE FLUID WHICH ROSE IN THE NECK OF THE RETORT REDDENED LITMUS PAPER AND RESEMBLED THE NITROUS ACID IN ODOUR COLOUR AND TASTE IT ACTED UPON THE MERCURY IN CONTACT WITH THE RE TORT AND WHEN WASHED OUT BY PURE WATER THE SOLUTION DID NOT AFFECT THE NITRATE OF BARYTES OR SILVER C THE PLATINUM WAS PERFECTLY REDUCED AND ITS PARTICLES FORMED A LOOSELY COHERENT MASS WHICH COULD NOT BE REMOVED UNTIL THE BULB OF THE RETORT WAS BROKEN IT WEIGLLED 9 GRAINS AND SUFFERED NO DIMINUTION ON BEING AGAIN HEATED TO REDNESS IN A PLATINUM CUP EXPERIMENT 9 TEN GRAINS OF THE SAME POWDER AS THAT USED IN THE FIRST EXPERIMENT AFFORDED BY ITS DECOMPOSITION 9G GRAINS OF PLATINUM A LITTLE FLUID AGREEING IN ITS PROPERTIES WITH THAT NOTICED IN THE FORMER EXPERIMENT AND J OF GAS WHICH WAS EXAMINED IN A DIFFERENT MANNER FROM THAT OF EX PERIMENT I THE GAS REMAINING IN THE RETORT WAS TREATED MDCCCXX Q 118MR DAVY OTN SOME 14J WITH PURE NITROUS GAS RED FUMES WERE PRODUCED AND THE ABSORPTION WAS SO GREAT THAT THE MERCURY PRESENTLY ROSE NEAR THE BULB OF THE RETORT AND WAS STILL RISING WHEN ITS NECK WAS INTENTIONALLY BROKEN TO SECURE THE PLATINUM HENCE IT SEEMS THE GAS IN THERETORT WAS OXYGEN THE GAS THAT CAME OVER WAS FIRST TREATED WITH LIMEWATER AN IMMEDIATE TURBIDNESS WAS PRODUCED AND INCREASED BY AGI TATION AND 29 OF THE GAS WERE ABSORBED TO THE RESIDUAL GAS NITROUS GAS WAS ADDED WHICH OCCASIONED A CONSIDERABLE ABSORPTION AND THE REMAINING GAS WHICH EXHIBITED THE PRO PERTIES OF NITROGEN WAS PRINCIPALLY DERIVED FROM THE COMMON AIR OF THE RETORT BY ADDING A LITTLE DILUTED MURIATIC ACID TO THE TURBID FLUID IT IMMEDIATELY BECAME TRANSPARENT AND THE ABSORBED CARBONIC ACID WAS SLOWLY DISENGAGED AND TLE MER CURY WAS STUDDED WITH INNUMERABLE LITTLE GLOBULES OF IT FROM THESE EXPERIMENTS LOO GRAINS OF THE BLACK POWDER APPEAR TO CONTAIN 9625 PLATINUM 875 NITROUS ACID A LITTLE OXYGEN AND A MINUTE PORTION OF CARBON 10000 THOUGH THE POWDER WAS DRIED AT A HEAT CONSIDERABLY ABOVE 212 IT MAY CONTAIN WATER AND IF THIS IS THE CASE ITS COM POSITION MAY BE DIFFERENTLY STATED AS DEDUCED FROM THE FORE GOING EXPERIMENTS 96250O PLATINUM O012OO OXYGEN OOIO6 CARBON 36194 NITROUS ACID AND WATERO 1000000COMBNZATIONS OF PLATINUM 4 OBSERVATIONS C ON THE PECULIAR COMPOUND FROM THE PRECEDING EXPERIMENTS THE BLACK POWDER OBTAIN ED BY THE AGENCY OF ALCOHOL ON THE SULPHATE OF PLATINUM APPEARS TO CONSIST ALMOST SOLELY OF PLATINUM WITH A LITTLE OXYGEN AND THE ELEMENTS OF THE NITROUS ACID THE VERY MINUTE PORTION OF CARBONACEOUS MATTER IT CONTAINS IS PROBABLY ACCIDENTAL IF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE POWDER IS SUCH AS I HAVE STATED A DOUBT MAY ARISE WHETHER IT CAN BE CONSIDERED AS A DEFINITE COMPOUND BUT ITS SOLUBILITY IN THE MURIATIC ACID THE FACILITY WITH WHICH IT COMBINES WITH SULPHUR AND RESISTS THE ACTION OF A STRONG SOLUTION OF POTASH AT A BOILING HEAT AND ITS ACQUIRING FULMINATING PROPERTIES IN LIQUID AMMONIA ARE ALL CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH FAVOUR THE NOTION OF ITS BEING A TRUE CHEMICAL COMPOUND IT SEEMS RATHER DOUBTFUL WHETHER THE POWDER CAN BE REGARDED AS A SUBNITRATE OF PLATINUM OR A COMBINATION OF PLATINUM WITH OXYGEN AND NITROGEN IN A DIFFERENT STATE FROM THAT IN WHICH THEY COEXIST IN THE NITROUS ACID ON THE IDEA THAT THE POWDER IS A COMPOUND OF THE METAL WITH A LITTLE OXYGEN AND NITROUS ACID SOMETHING MAY BE SAID ON THE MODE OF ITS FORMATION AND ON THE MORE RE MARKABLE PROPERTIES IT EXHIBITS FROM THE MANNER IN WHICH THE SULPHATE OF PLATINUM IS FORMED NAMELY BY THE AGENCY OF NITROUS ACID ON THE HYDRO SULPHURET OF PLATINUM THERE CAN BE NO DIFFICULTY IN ACCOUNTING FOR THE PRESENCE OF A SMALL PORTION OF NITROUS ACID IN IT AND MY EXPERIMENTS INCLINE ME TO THE OPINION THAT IT IS SCARCELY POSSIBLE TO SEPARATE THE LAST PORTIONS OF NITROUS ACID FROM THE SULPHATE WITHOUT ENTIRELY DECOMPOSING IT THAT THE QUAN TITY OF NITROUS ACID IN THE SULPHATE MUST HOWEVER BE VERYMR DAVY ON SOME LIMITED APPEARS FROM THIS CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THE ADDITION OF A LITTLE NITROUS ACID TO THE SULPHATE ENTIRELY PREVENTS THE FORMA TION OF THE BLACK POWDER THOUGH SUCCESSIVE PORTIONS OF ALCO HOL BE ADDED AND THE WHOLE BOILED FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME WHEN SULPHATE OF PLATINUM CONTAINING A LITTLE NITROUS ACID IS TREATED WITH ALCOHOL A MUTUAL ACTION TAKES PLACE SLOWLY AT THE COMMON TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR BUT RAPIDLY BY THE ASSISTANCE OF HEAT THE SULPHURIC ACID BEING UNITED TO THE OXIDE OF PLATINUM BY A WEAK AFFINITY SEEMS TO FORM A NEW COMBINATION WITH THE ALCOHOL WHILST THE OXIDE COMBINES WITH THE PORTION OF NITROUS ACID PRESENT TO FORM THE BLACK POW DER IN CERTAIN CASES AS IS WELL KNOWN ALCOHOL SEPARATES SALTS FROM THEIR AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS IN CONSEQUENCE OF A STRONGER AFFINITY FOR THE WATER IN WHICH THEY ARE DISSOLVED BUT IN THIS INSTANCE THE AGENCIES OF ALCOHOL AND OF NITROUS ACID ARE PROBABLY CONCERNED IN SEPARATING THE SULPHURIC ACID FROM THE SULPHATE THE VIVID ACTION OF AMMONIACAL GAS ON THE POWDER MAY BE REFERRED TO THE MUTUAL ENERGY WITH WHICH THE ALKALINE GAS AND LOOSELY COMBINED NITROUS ACID IN THE POWDER ACT UPON EACH OTHER I FOUND BY EXPERIMENT THAT AMMONIACAL GAS IS ABSORBED IN THIS INSTANCE THUS 3 GRAINS OF THE POWDER WERE PLACED IN A GRADUATED GLASS RECEIVER AND FILLED WITH DRY MER CURY 23 CUBIC INCHES OF AMMONIACAL GAS CONTAINING ONLY IMPURITY WERE LET UP INTO THE RECEIVER AN IMMEDIATE ACTION TOOK PLACE THE POWDER BECAME IGNITED AND AFTER TWO HOURSL OF A CUBIC INCH OF THE GAS WERE ABSORBED RECENTLY BOILED PURE WATER WHILST YET HOT WAS LET UP INTO THE RECEIVER AND THE RESIDUAL GAS WAS ALL ABSORBED EXCEPT A SMALL GLOBULE WHICH DID NOT EXCEED THE ORIGINAL IMPURITY IN THE AMMONIA LL6COMBINATIONS OFPLATINUM THE ACTION OF ALCOHOL ON THE POWDER IS CURIOUS AND IS CONNECTED WITH THE DECOMPOSITION OF BOTH SUBSTANCES WHEN THE POWDER IS BROUGHT IN CONTACT WITH THE VAPOUR OF ALCOHOL AT THE COMMON TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR THERE IS AN IMMEDIATE CHEMICAL ACTION THE HEAT GENERATED IS SUFFICIENT TO REDUCE AND IGNITE THE METAL AND TO CONTINUE IT IN A STATE OF IGNITION UNTIL THE ALCOHOL IS CONSUMED IN THIS CASE THE ACID FIRST NOTICED BY SIR H DAVY IN HIS BEAUTIFUL EXPERIMENT OF THE IGNITED PLATINUM WIRE AND SINCE MORE FULLY EXAMINED BY MR DANIELL IS PRODUCED IN OTHER INSTANCES THE ACETIC ACID AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED IS FORMED IT WOULD BE PREMA TURE TO SPECULATE ON THE USES TO WHICH THIS POWDER MAY BE APPLIED BUT FROM ITS PECULIAR PROPERTIES THERE IS REASON TO THINK IT WILL ADMIT OF SOME USEFUL APPLICATIONS I HAVE ALREADY EMPLOYED IT AS AN EASY MEANS OF AFFORDING HEAT AND LIGHT TO PRODUCE HEAT IT IS ONLY NECESSARY TO MOISTEN ANY POROUS SUB STANCE SUCH AS SPONGE CORK COTTON ASBESTOS SAND C WITH ALCOHOL OR WHISKEY AND TO LET A PARTICLE OF THE POWDER FALL ON THE SUBSTANCE SO MOISTENED  IT INSTANTLY BECOMES RED HOT AND REMAINS SO UNTIL THE SPIRIT IS CONSUMED NOR IS THE IGNITED METAL EXTINGUISHED BY EXPOSURE TO THE ATMOSPHERE OR BY BLOWING THE BREATH ON IT ON THE CONTRARY PARTIAL CURRENTS OF AIR ONLY MAKE IT GLOW BRIGHTER THE HEAT PRODUCED IN THIS WAY MAY BE ACCUMULATED TO A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT BY INCREA SING THE QUANTITY OF THE MATERIALS EMPLOYED I HAVE ALSO CONSTRUCTED A TINDER BOX TO PROCURE IMMEDIATE LIGHT BY MEANS OF THE POWDER IT CONSISTS OF TWO SMALL PHIALS PLACED IN A JAPANNED BOX AND SOME SULPHUR MATCHES TIPPED WITH PHOSPHORUS ONE OF THE PHIALS CONTAINS THE POWDER THE OTHER ALCOHOL THE STOPPER OF THE PHIAL CONTAINING THE ALCOHOL 1171MR DAVY ON SOME HAS A BIT OF SPONGE INSERTED IN A SMALL APERTURE AT THE BOTTON OF IT WHEN A LIGHT IS WANTED IT IS ONLY NECESSARY TO SHAKE THE BOTTLE SO AS TO MOISTEN THE SPONGE WITH THE ALCOHOL TAKE OUT THE STOPPER AND PUT THE SMALLEST PARTICLE OF THE POWDER ON THE MOISTENED SPONGE IT INSTANTLY BECOMES RED HOT AND WILL READILY KINDLE ONE OF THE MATCHES THIS MODE OF IGNITING A METAL SEEMS TO BE QUITE A NEW FACT IN THE HISTORY OF CHEMISTRY BUT THE MEANS OF KEEPING IT IN A STATE OF IGNITION IS ONLY ANOTHER ILLUSTRATION OF THE FACTS PREVIOUSLY POINTED OUT BY SIR H DAVY IN HIS LATE VALUABLE RESEARCHES WHICH HAVE THROWN SO MUCH LIGHT ON THE PHILOSOPHY OF FLAME AND LED TO SUCH VERY INTERESTING IMPORTANT AND UNEXPECTED RESULTS 5 ON THE EFFECTS OF SULPHATE OF PLATINUM UPON GELATINE WHEN AN AQUEOUS SOLUTION OF SULPHATE OF PLATINUM IS ADDED TO ANY SOLUTION OF GELATINE SUCH AS ISINGLASS SIZE OR GLUE A PRECIPITATE OCCURS AND ALL THE SULPHATE IS SEPARATED IN UNION WITH THE GELATINE OR IF A MINUTE PORTION REMAIN IT IS PRECI PITATED ON BOILING THE FLUID THIS PRECIPITATE WHILST IN A MOIST STATE IS OF A BROWN COLOUR AND HAS SOME DEGREE OF TENACITY BUT WHEN WELL WASHED AND DRIED AT A TEMPERATURE A LITTLE ABOVE THE BOILING POINT OF WATER ITS COLOUR CHANGES TO A JET BLACK IT BECOMES HARD AND BRITTLE AND HAS A RESINOUS LUSTRE IT IS NOT DECOMPOSED BY BEING BOILED IN WATER OR IN WEAK ALKALINE SOLUTIONS WHEN IT IS GENTLY HEATED BY A SPIRIT LAMP ON A SLIP OF PLATINUM A VIOLENT ACTION IS PRODUCED AND A DENSE WHITE VAPOUR IS EXHALED IN WHICH THE ODOUR OF SULPHUREOUS ACID IS PERCEPTIBLE THE SUBSTANCE BECOMES IG NITED AND IS PRESENTLY DECOMPOSED LEAVING THE REDUCED PLA TINUM IN SMALL GRAINS II8COMBINATIONS OF PLATINUM WHEN THIS COMPOUND IS DECOMPOSED BY HEAT IN CLOSE VESSELS OVER WATER OR MERCURY IT YIELDS A GREY SULPHURET OF PLATINUM NITROGEN SULPHUREOUS CARBURETTED HYDROGEN AND CARBONIC ACID GASES CARBONATE OF AMMONIA AND AN OILY LIKE FLUID THIS COMPOUND OF SULPHATE OF PLATINUM AND GELA TINE WHEN DRIED AT A HEAT JUST ABOVE THAT OF BOILING WATER AFFORDED BY ITS DECOMPOSITION IN TWO EXPERIMENTS HALF ITS WEIGHT OF PLATINUM AND IF MY FORMER STATEMENT OF THE CONI POSITION OF SULPHATE OF PLATINUM IS CORRECT LOO GRAINS OF THE ABOVE COMPOUND WILL CONSIST OF ABOUT 561 1 OXIDE OF PLATINUM O202 SULPHURIC ACID 2387 GELATINE AND WATER 10000 6 ON THE SULPHATE OF PLATINUM AS A TEST FOR GELATINEO AS I FOUND THAT MINUTE QUANTITIES OF GELATINE IN SOLUTION WERE READILY DETECTED BY THE SULPHATE OF PLATINUM I MADE SOME EXPERIMENTS TO ASCERTAIN THE EFFICACY OF THIS SUBSTANCE AS A TEST FOR GELATINE AND I AM INCLINED TO THINK IT MERITS A DE CIDED PREFERENCE OVER THE REAGENTS AT PRESENT USED BY CHE MISTS FOR THIS PURPOSE THE BEST KNOWN SUBSTANCES FOR DE TECTING THE PRESENCE OF GELATINE ARE I PRESUME THOSE WHICH CONTAIN THE TANNING PRINCIPLE AS THE INFUSIONS OF OAKBARK NUTGALLS CATECHU C AND A VARIETY OF GELATINE ISINGLASS AS IS WELL KNOWN IS EMPLOYED TO ASCERTAIN THE QUANTITY OF  IN THE  ANNALES DE CHIMIE C TOME V M VAUQUVELIN TREATS OF THE SULPHURET OF PLATINUM AS A NEW COMPOUND WHICH HE HAD FORMED BUT I PUBLISHED AN ACCOUNT OF IT IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE IN THE YEAR I8 IZ 119MR DAVY ON SOME TANNING PRINCIPLE IN DIFFERENT ASTRINGENT SUBSTANCES BUT FOR THIS PURPOSE AS SIR H DAVY HAS SHOWN MANY PRECAUTIONS ARE NECESSARY AND FROM HIS EXPERIMENTS IT APPEARS THAT TANNIN MAY EXIST IN A STATE OF COMBINATION IN WHICH ITS PRE SENCE CANNOT BE MADE EVIDEN8 BY MEANS OF A SOLUTION OF GELATINE I HAVE MADE SEVERAL COMPARATIVE EXPERIMENTS ON THE EFFICACY OF THOSE ASTRINGENT INFUSIONS AND OF THE SULPHATE OF PLATINUM AS TESTS FOR GELATINE AND I THINK I MAY VENTURE TO CONCLUDE THAT THE SULPHATE IS A TEST OF SUPERIOR DELICACY AND MORE CERTAIN IN ITS OPERATION THUS IN CASES WHERE THE GELATINE WAS IN VERY MINUTE QUANTITY OR IN A VERY DILUTED STATE WIHEN NO EFFECT WAS PRODUCED BY STRONG INFUSIONS OF OAKBARK NUTGALLS OR CATECHU THERE WAS AN IMMEDIATE PRE CIPITATE ON ADDING SULPHATE OF PLATINUM IN INSTANCES ALSO WHEN THE QUANTITY OF GELATINE WAS TOO MINUTE TO BE READILY DETECTED BY SIMPLY ADDING THE SULPHATE THE EFFECT WAS IM MEDIATELY PRODUCED ON BOILING THE FLUID THE EFFECTS OF SULPHATE OF PLATINUM ON SOLUTIONS OF TLTE DIFFERENT V R ETIES OF GELATINE AS ISINGLASS GLUE AND SIZE APPEAR TO BE PRECISELY SIMILAR AND THE PRECIPITATES OBTAINED IN SUCH CASES SEEM TO BE UNIFORM IN THEIR PROPERTIES AND COMPOSITION  NOR ARE THEY AFFECTED BY THE PRESENCE OF ANY OF THE MINERAL ACIDS IN EXCESS THE OPERATION OF ASTRINGENT INFUSIONS AS OAKBARK NUTGALLS AND CATECHU ON SOLUTIONS OF THE DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF GELATINE IS NOT UNIFORM ACCORDING TO SIR H4 DAVY CATECHU CONTAINS A MUCH LARGER QUANTITY OF THE TANNLING PRINCIPLE THAN OAKBARK YET I FOUND THAT AN IN FUSION OF IT PRODUCED NO PRECIPITATE IN SOLUTIONS OF SIZE OF DIFFERENT DEGREES OF CONCENTRATION THE SIZE I EMPLOYED WAS  PHIL TRANS 1803 1120COMBINATIONS QF PLATINUM SUCH AS PAPERHANGERS USE IT HAD BEEN RECENTLY PREPARED AND WAS PREVIOUS TO ITS BEING DISSOLVED IN WATER IN THE FORM OF A TREMULOUS JELLY THE SULPHATE OF PLATINUM OCCASIONS AFTER A SHORT TIME A BROWN PRECIPITATE IN ASTRINGENT INFUSIONS BUT THIS SUBSTANCE I HAVE NOT EXAMINED 7 ON A GREY OXIDE OF PLATINUM IN THE COURSE OF MY EXPERIMENTS TO ASCERTAIN THE COMPO SITION OF FULMINATING PLATINUM I TREATED IT WITH NITROUS ACID AND THUS PROCURED AS I HAVE ELSEWHERE STATED A GREY OXIDE OF PLATINUM WHICH HAS NOT YET BEEN DESCRIBED IT MAY BE OBTAINED BY ADDING STRONG NITROUS ACID TO FULMINATING PLATI NUM BOILING IT TO DRYNESS AND EXPOSING THE DRY MASS TO A HEAT JUST BELOW REDNESS SO AS TO EXPEL ALL THE NITROUS ACID THE OXIDE OF PLATINUM REMAINS IT IS TO BE FINELY PULVERIZED AND BOILED FIRST IN PURE WATER AND THEN IN A WEAK SOLUTION OF CAUSTIC ALKALI TO SEPARATE THE LAST PORTIONS OF ACID WHICH ADHERE WITH GREAT TENACITY TO IT IT IS NOW TO BE WELL WASHED AND DRIED AT A HEAT NOT EXCEEDING THAT OF BOILING MERCURY I HAVE USUALLY MADE THE EXPERIMENT IN A PLATINUM CRUCIBLE ON A HOT SAND BATH THE OXIDE THUS PREPARED EXHIBITS THE FOLLOWING PROPERTIES 8 PROPERTIES AND COMPOSITION OF THE GREY OXIDE OF PLATINUM ITS COLOUR IS DAK IRON GREY IT HAS THE METALLIC LUSTRE IT IS SUFFICIENTLY HARD TO CUT BRASS WHICH IT POLISHES AND WHEN THE POLISHED SURFACE IS RUBBED A LITTLE WITH THE OXIDE A DELI CATE COATING OF PLATINUM REMAINS IT DOES NOT TOUCH STEEL IT IS NOT AFFECTED BY COLD OR HOT WATER NOR BY THE NITROUS SULPHURIC OR PHOSPHORIC ACID AT A BOILING HEAT IT IS INSOLUBLE MDCCCXX R 11LAIMIR DAVY V SOME IN NITROMURIATIC ACID AND IN COLD MURIATIC ACID BUT IT SLOWLY DISSOLVES IN THIS LAST ACID BY THE ASSISTANCE OF HEAT IT IS NOT ACTED UPON BY A STRONG SOLUTION OF THE FIXED ALKALIES WHEN THE OXIDE IS PUT INTO LIQUID AMMONIA MINUTE GLOBULES OF AIR ARE EVOLVED FROM IT BUT THE QUANTITY HAS BEEN TOO SMALL TO ADMIT OF BEING EXAMINED PROBABLY IT IS COMMON AIR AS THE OXIDE APPEARS TO UNDERGO NO CHANGE BY BEING KEPT FOR SOME WEEKS IN AMMONIA WHEN HEATED WITH SULPHUR THE OXIDE YIELDS SULPHUREOUS ACID GAS AND A GREY SULPHURET OF PLA TINUM WHEN MIXED WITH ZINC FILINGS AND HEATED THE OXIDE IS DECOMPOSED WITH VIVID IGNITION AND WHITE OXIDE OF ZINC IS FORMED WHEN THE OXIDE IS MIXED WITH BORAX AND EXPOSED TO A STRONG RED HEAT BEFORE THE BLOWPIPE IT FORMS A BLACK GLASS WLHICH BECOMES OF A LIGHTER COLOUR ON URGING THE HEAT TO WHITENESS AND THE OXIDE APPEARS TO BE REDUCED IF THE OXIDE IS MIXED WITH POWDERED GLASS AND FUSED A GLASS IS OBTAINED OF A DULL BROWN COLOUR THE OXIDE IS READILY REDUCED BY MOISTENING IT WITH OIL OF TURPENTINE AND HEATING IT MODERATELY OR BY EXPOSING IT TO A DULL RED HEAT IN THE ATMOSPHERE BUT IT REQUIRES A STRONG RED HEAT TO REDUCE IT IN CLOSE VESSELS SOME OF THE OXIDE WHICH HAD BEEN WELL DRIED FIRST ON A HOT SAND BATH AND THEN EXPOSED TO A HEAT JUST BELOW REDNESS ON A SLIP OF PLATINUM WAS DECOMPOSED IN VERY SMALL GREEN GLASS RETORTS OVER MERCURY IN TWO EXPERIMENTS IN WHICH I USED 7 GRAINS OF THE OXIDE I OBTAINED IN EACH INSTANCE 6 GRAINS OF PLATINUM AND AE CUBIC INCHES OF OXYGEN THE THERMOMETER BEING AT 60O AND BAROMETER B0O I FOUND ALSO IN THE NECKS OF THE RE TORTS A SLIGHT TRACE OF A FUID THAT REDDENED LITMUS PAPER AND HAD AN ODOUR SIMILAR TO THAT OF NITROUS ACID NOW IF 1249COMBINATIONS OFPLATINUM 6 GRAINS OF PLATINUM COMBINE WITH 21 CUBIC INCHES OF OXY GEN LOO GRAINS WILL TAKE 34 CUBIC INCHES AND CALCULATING FROM SIR H DAVYS STATEMENT THAT LOO CUBIC INCHES OF OXY GEN WEIGH 34 GRAINS THE GREY OXIDE OF PLATINUM WILL BE FOUND TO CONSIST OF IOO PLATINUM OR PER CENT OF 89366 PLATINUM 11 9 OXYGEN J O 634 OXYGEN 100O000 IT WILL BE READILY SEEN THAT I HAVE HERE DEDUCED THE COM POSITION OF THE GREY OXIDE FROM THE ACTUAL QUANTITY OF OXY GEN AND METAL OBTAINED IN THE EXPERIMENTS AND THIS MODE OF ANALYSIS SEEMS LIABLE TO LITTLE OBJECTION AND CAN VERY RARELY BE RESORTED TO IN ASCERTAINING THE COMPOSITION OF METALLIC OXIDES ON COMPARING MY PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTS UPON THE GREY OXIDE WITH THE ABOVE RESULTS I AM MOST INCLINED TO PLACE CONFIDENCE IN THE LATTER THERE IS INDEED A NEAR CO INCIDENCE BETWEEN THEM AND THE DIFFERENCE WHICH IS ONLY ABOUT ONE PER CENT MAY BE REFERRED TO THE PRESENCE OF A LITTLE MORE ACID IN MY FIRST EXPERIMENTS THE GREY OXIDE IS INSOLUBLE IN AQUA REGIA A FACT WHICH SEEMS TO ADD ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TO SIR HDAVYS OPINION RESPECTING THE ACTION OF AQUA REGIA ON PLATINUM THIS MENSTRUUM ACCORDING TO SIR H DAVY DOES NOT OXIDATE PLATINUM BUT MERELY CAUSES ITS COMBINATION WITH CHLORINE NOW IF THE METAL WERE OXI DATED PREVIOUS TO ITS SOLUTION THE OXYGEN THERE IS REASON TO THINK WOULD BE DERIVED FROM THE NITROUS ACID ANDTHE GREY OXIDE FORMED BY THIS ACID BE PRODUCED WHICH CAN SCARCELY  JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND THE ARTS VOL I 123MR DAVY ON SOME BE THE CASE AS IT IS INSOLUBLE IN AQUA REGIA ADD TO THIS THE FACT THAT BY EVAPORATING A COMMON SOLUTION OF PLATINUM TO DRYNESS NO NITRATE CAN BE OBTAINED BUT ONLY A MURIATE OR A COMPOUND OF THE METAL AND CHLORINE IF ACCORDING TO THE STATEMENTS OF PROFESSORS VAUQUELWN AND BERZELIUS THE BLACK OXIDE OF PLATINUM CONTAINS ABOUT 15 PER CENT OF OXYGEN THE GREY OXIDE MAY BE CONSIDERED AS THE PROTOXIDE CONTAINING I PROPORTION AND THE BLACK OXIDE I PROPORTION OF OXYGEN AND THE NUMBER REPRESENTING THE ELEMENT OR PROPORTION IN WHICH PLATINUM CONLBINES WITH BO DIES WILL BE 126 TAKING SIR H DAVYS NUMBER 15 TO REPRE SENT THE PROPORTION IN WHICH OXYGEN UNITES WITH BODIES MR COOPER STATES THE BLACK OXIDE OF PLATINUM TO CONSIST OF LOO PLATINUM WITH ONLY 4317 OF OXYGEN BUT HE HAS I THINK CONSIDERABLY UNDERRATED THE OXYGEN IN IT ON RE PEATING HIS EXPERIMENTS ON A SMALL SCALE I OBTAINED RESULTS DIFFERENT FROM THOSE HE HAS STATED THUS HE SAYS THE POWDER OBTAINED FROM THE MURIATE OF PLATINUM BY A NEUTRAL SOLUTION OF MERCURY IS A COMPOUND OF CALOMEL AND THE PROTOXIDE OF PLATINUM BUT BY DECOMPOSING THIS POWDER IN A LITTLE RETORT OVER MERCURY I FOUND THE NECK OF THE RETORT PARTIALLY LINED WITH METALLIC MERCURY AND THIS FACT ALONE I THINK IS SUFFI CIENT TO AWAKEN SUSPICION AS TO THE ACCURACY OF HIS RESULTS MR COOPER I PRESUME USED A NITRATE OF MERCURY TO DECOM POSE THE MURIATE OF PLATINUM BUT HE SEEMS TO HAVE OVER LOOKED THE NITROUS ACID IN STATING HIS RESULTS THE CHEMICAL HISTORY OF PLATINUM IS FAR FROM BEING COM PLETE THE GREAT WANT OF UNIFORMITY IN THE STATEMENTS OF  JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND THE ARTS VOL II  124COMBINATIONS OF PLATINUM 125 CHEMISTS RESPECTING THE COMPOSITION OF THE KNOWN COMPOUNDS OF THIS VALUABLE METAL AND THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF THEIR

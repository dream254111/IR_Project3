University of Illinois which has existed since 1876 should be discontinued Mr J P Gilbert who was an instructor in zoology has just been elected head of the department of biology and agri culture in the Southern Illinois Normal at Carbondale Another member of the academy force Mr S E Boomer goes also to the Southern Illinois Normal as head of the mathematics department DR HANS ZINSSER has been promoted to be professor of bacteriology in Stanford Univer sity THE School of Engineering of the Univer sity of Pittsburgh announces a new course in mechanical railway engineering which will be under the direction of Mr D F Crawford general superintendent of motive power Pennsylvania lines west of Pittsburgh Stu dents working in this course will combine their theoretical course with practical work in connection with the Pennsylvania lines west of Pittsburgh THE Bryn Mawr European fellowship has been awarded this year to Miss Helen Tred way who specialized in physics and chemistry the presidents European fellowship to Miss Mary E Pinney in biology and the Mary E Garret European fellowship to Miss Margaret E Brusstar in mathematics DISCUSSION AND CORRESPONDENCE THE ACOUSTICAL ENGINEER THE subject of acoustics as applied to audi toriums deserves a much greater interest on the part of physicists and architects It is not just however to offer criticism without considering some of the reasons for this lack of attention The physicist realizes that there are many practical problems which constantly tempt him to turn from the performance of his proper function Moreover he knows that physicists Sabine and others have already obtained results far in advance of what are actually utilized by architects today On the other hand the architect is a man of many troubles and is therefore not inclined to add to his cares by indulgence in experimental work or by applying Sabines formula to a proposed auditorium His fee does not cover such expert work and he very naturally at tempts to do well that for which he is paid In short there is not a sufficient incentive for active interest on the part of either the phys icist or the architect In spite of the excellent work that has been done particularly by Sabine our knowledge of the subject of architectural acoustics is quite limited It is true although doubted even by some physicists that one can not only correct excessive reverberation of an audi torium already constructed but he can even compute what effect will be had in a proposed structure This however is only a small part of the achievement that will some day be pos sible Again our methods of correcting ex cessive reverberation are not entirely satis factory either to an architect or to a layman who desires the remedy to be both permanent and sanitary It is not for the physicist to improve our present methods of remedying excessive reverberation for this is a practical problem involving structural knowledge Neither can he be expected to think of the problems of theoretical interest which will sooner or later confront one engaged in ap plied acoustics It seems then that the future progress of the subject of acoustics as applied to audi toriums rests in a very large measure upon the activity of what might be termed the  acoustical engineer This engineer must be an architect of scientific trainingone who will be interested alike in the architectural and scientific aspects of the problems Gen erally speaking each auditorium needs a slightly different study and one who is to suc ceed must have sufficient scientific interest and ability to make the necessary investiga tions As so well known absorbing material applied to the proper area of surface will cor rect for excessive reverberation But the amount of area that can be utilized the char acter of the interior finish etc enter into the 527N S VOL XXXIII No 849 problem The absorbing material applied should be tested experimentally so that the area covered will give a satisfactory result Moreover in cases of welldefined echoes each auditorium will probably require more de tailed study There are an increasing number of archi tects in this country who are actively inter ested in the subject of architectural acoustics but with one exception they have not de voted much time to experimental investiga tion This exception is an architect who is devoting his entire time to acoustical engi neering On the other hand the public does not realize the present knowledge on the sub ject of architectural acoustics and the archi tect does not make a serious attempt to educate The purpose of this note is to call the attention of scientific men to the acous tical engineer and to urge their active inter est so far as the education of the public and the recognition of the need of such a con sulting engineer are concerned G W STEWART THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF IowA ACADEMIC EFFICIENCY To THE EDITOR OF SCIENCE Since on sev eral occasions there have appeared in SCIENCE certain criticisms of the Cooke report of the Carnegie Foundation I hope that you may be willing to publish a brief statement of an opposite view Both the report itself and its introduction by Dr Pritchett state clearly that the opinions of an outsider were considered desirable The recent criticisms of collegiate conditions by many who have not actually studied at first hand the things they condemn seem to have led to the investigation upon which the report is based Most of the opinions set forth in the report are precisely those which any wellinformed person not connected with a college would hold after a similar study of what actually exists Moreover not a few persons on the inside of the college world hold quite similar views In some ways certain of us go even farther in condemning a part of the things that are more or less characteristic of the col lege life of today Especially in trying to fit young men to meet successfully the practical conditions of the real business world we lament most deeply the woeful lack of the  snap and vigor which Mr Cooke found wanting in most of the institutions visited The lack of inten siveness appeals to us much more as a hindrance to the proper preparation of our students for what we know will be required of them in the near future than for any other reason Not a few of those who employ many highly trained workers positively condemn the college graduate and will not hire him until he has been whipped into line by sufficient practical experience after his graduation Some of us know that this is not on account of the subjects which we teach or do not teach in our courses but rather on account of the general attitude of many of our graduates toward the work that may be assigned them During the first half year of the cooperative system at the University of Cincinnati Dean Schneider says he was frequently called to his telephone to listen to something similar to this That cub you sent down here thinks this is a university He wont work Far too many young men in the colleges and in the collegiate departments of the universities wont work Too many students in all of our institutions have no proper conception of the real economic value of their own time or of the opportunities within their grasp Such ones do not make efficient use of what is pro vided for them in funds and in equipments of various kinds They cut class and labora tory exercises without adequate reasons They try all kinds of schemes to get out of regular and systematic work They neglect to do many of the things assigned to them in many cases up to what they consider the very lower limit of a bare passing grade Sometimes they ask if they can cut this or neglect that and still have a chance to  pass They give time energy and most of the thinking that they do to things which can not be of the least permanent value to them in later life Such students do these and many other 528 SCIENCE

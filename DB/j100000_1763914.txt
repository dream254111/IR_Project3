subjects may be employed in the systematic train ing of the judgment and the reasoning powers I shall follow as nearly as possible the order laid down in the previous article The lessons which I have described under these 1 From the Journal of education a paper read before the Education society Oct 25 1886 1FEBRUARY 18 1887 S C011 heads when illustrating the training of the faculty of conception will serve admirably for exercising the child in forming implicit and explicit judg ments and in making statements concerning the striking attributes of things For material ob jects chalk salt coal and the common metals will afford us numerous lessons and so will the series of inquiries into the nature properties and action of water so admirably described in Hux leys Introductory science primer For form we may use the regular solids surfaces and lines while botany and natural history will provide an inexhaustible supply of lessons on life1 The main thing will be to make sure that the child states in clear unambiguous language which he under stands only such facts as he has really observed Classification will inevitably introduce the forma tion of judgments and definition will involve the putting of them into words2 But better at this stage than classification or definition will be a simple narrative given by the child of what he has seen in the above lessons or of what has hap pened to him during the past week or on some specially marked occasion Later propositions may be presented to the child for acceptance or rejection those being the best which cmn readily be shown to be true or false Perhaps the easiest of such propositions will concern number and magnitude For number the simplest problems of arithmetic are ready to hand even such as the old catch  which would you rather have six dozen dozen or half a dozen dozen will be useful For magnitude we may take such a problem as the arranging of a number of fractions in the order of their value or a com parison of incomes derived from investments in different stocks every step in the proofs being clearly indicated and explained If we desire to be more concrete we may choose such a problem as the finding of the shortest distance between two points placing thle two points on the blackboard and letting a piece of strlng hang in a loop be tween them showing how it projects beyond them when pulled straight and then beginning with it straight and showing how its ends must ap proach one another in order to allow the string to hang in a loop and so on through the many simple problems of practical geometry But the See the admirable list of lessons under the heads of Form and space Material and force Life and organic products given by Dr Wormell in his paper on The teaching of elementary science in the Educational times March 1886 2 By classification and definition I of course do not mean here the complete fullgrown acts of the adult but the imper fect graduallygrowing acts of the child We are too often given to ignoring that there must be a growth and progress in these processes as in every thing else which a child him self does VCE 165 opportunities for exercising judgments are too numerous to need particular mention Let us only bear in mind the order of their difficulty and very soon introduce reasoning side by side with them At an early stage you will remember the child is to be encouraged to search for causes Here again a wide field lies before us The only diffi culty is what to choose Again our only guide is the order of nature and simplicity The reason why fire burns the hand or why a book when let go falls is difficult and complicated But it is simple to discover why if I divide a sheet of paper into four equal parts and take three of them I get the same amount as when I divide it into eight equal parts and take six of them At a much more advanced stage we may attempt to find the reason why if a number is divisible by nine the sum of its digits is also divisible by nine while all the simpler theorems of abstract geometry will supply the young inquirer with numberless examples fairly within his power  the theorems being put in the form of questions why is a cer tain fact true or is it true or not true The main difficulties about causes lie in there being more than one of them at a time at work and in their being hard to find At first therefore the cases we choose should involve only single causes and those very evident Later we may proceed to such lessons as those on the forms of water in Huxleys Introductory primer which I have already referred to and which introduce more than one cause  change of temperature and change of pressure for instance in the cases oL evaporation and condensation But even here we may make things much simpler by taking one agent at a time and noting its effect instead of seeking for all the causes of some phenomenon So we may note the effect of heat and of cold on water separately the nature of steam the ef fect of sudden change of density on moist air in the bell of an airpump A most interesting lesson may be given by gathering from our pupils and discussing all the instances we can of the disap pearance of waterapparently into the air clothes hung up to dry wet pavements after a shower water in a kettle boiled away etc etc Again the reappearance of moisture from the air the cold plate held over the steam from the spout of a kettlethe moisture on the outside of a glass of icedwater dew when the sky is clear and the night fine the washinghouse etc etc Then the experiment with moist air in the bell of the airpump the formation of the cloud due to the sudden lessening of pressure the cloud depositing its moisture on the glass and so on We note the frequent if not unvarying concomitant in each166 S CILNG E case assume it as a cause make further experi ments on this assumption in the way described in the  method of experiment given above Causes may also be dealt with in our history lessons in numberless ways especially when the children are encouraged to bring their practical knowledge of modern things to bear on things of the past The causes of the English settlement in Britain of the invasions of the Norsemen and Danes can be made fairly clear by the light of modern emigration and immigration Why the English chose John for king and their fellowsub jects on the continent at least some of them chose Arthur will not be difficult for the children to discover while starting from our modern ag ricultural troubles we may attempt a more elab orate chain of reasoning and accumulation of causes in explanation of the peasant revolt in the latter part of the fourteenth century I do not think it will be needful for me to go into detail  the demands of the peasants the actual occur rences of the rebellion and the events which im mediately preceded and followed it will suggest sufficient causes to the teacher and his pupils and into these investigation may then be made Nor need I point out how strikingly suggestive of an explanation recent events have been  distress of a general character agricultural distress and dis agreements political discontent the introduction of the element of rowdyism socialism wanton destruction of property by the regular London mob even the guardians of order appear to have been as paralyzed and useless in this town of Lon don on the one occasion as on the other The analogy is strikingly complete But we must be careful Analogies are dangerous things and are wont to carry us too far and to make us read into a case evidence not really there They should sug gest the direction and nature of our inquiries rather than be taken as in themselves sufficient explanations But after all the great thing in work of this kind is to choose our subjectmatter from common everyday events and things or to bring what we choose at once into as close a rela tion as is possible with everyday experience and modern doings moreover we need not exhaust or attempt to exhaust all the causes for our phe nomena Provided that the children are made and kept keenly aware that there are other causes besides those we are considering we shall do no harm in confining ourselves to the most promi nent In the work we have been describing we shall gradually have advanced from individuals to classes  the statements at which we have been arriving will have contained predicates more and more general and more and more abstract Now VOL IX No 211 we may begin to check and correct misstate ments to curb exaggerations and to encourage the child to make more marked distinction be tween fancy and reality We may begin some simple deduction consisting of the application of some simple general principles or general conclu sions to the explanation and solution of particular cases Arithmetic and algebra  and later some of our language work will be found of great assistance here We could hardly begin with any thing better perhaps than the deduction of the rules for the multiplication and division of vulgar fractions from the general principles that regulate the nature of a vulgar fraction and from the general principles of multiplication and divis ion The ways of doing this are numerous and familiar to every one we of course generally be gin by establishing the rules referring to those changes in the form of a fraction which do not affect its value and in making clear the fact that the numerator and denominator of a fraction may be treated as the dividend and divisor of a sum in division or to put it concisely such an expres sion as  of I is the same as I of 2 But whatever plan we adopt of this we should take the great est care  that our reasoning is strictly and hon estly deductive and that its wording and its cogency are both thoroughly understood and appreciated by our pupils This however is just the very thing that teachers as a rule will not take the trouble to do They are in too great a lhurry to get to the working of sums the mechanical manipulation of figures or symbols This they seem to look upon as the great end of arithmetic work and when their pupils have applied a rule never clearly understood to some hundred per fectly mechanical examples the teacher will lead them on with the utmost complacency to an other mechanical exercise Shall I be exaggerat ing if I say that more than half the teachers of arithmetic to children fe unable to explain clearly to any one when the time for explanation comes the principles of say short division Not because the matter is abstruse and difficult but because they have never thought it necessary to under stand those principles The principles of the method of deduction however will come out more clearly in some of the problems of algebra  such as the theory of indices  and in simple propositions of theoretical geometry It is lamentable how seldom one gets so easy a piece of reasoning as the theory of in dices clearly and correctly set forth by pupils whom no diabolic complication of quantities and signs and brackets can dismay They can manipulate almost any thing they can reason out nothingSCIENCE The former is good enough in its way but to omit the reasoning is to my mind to omit the most valuable part of the training The text books are in a measure to blame for this We want the stages of the work more clearly marked  the first assumption with regard to a2 as etc the more advanced assumption with regard to an with the involved assumption that n is a positive integer the first deductions as to the results of ax X ain and am  am the desirability of extend ing our notation and introducing indices of any value the necessity for a further assumption our right to assume that am x an shall equal aml for all values of m and n the results of this assump tion when applied to explain the meaning of an when n is zero negative and fractional All these should be clearly marked and clearly dis cussed and so treated I know of no piece of elementary deduction more invigorating and sat isfactory to the young learner In geometry we usually fare better at least in the textbooks the reasoning is well linked and clearly set forth The deductions are simple and they have this great advantage that they can be immediately put to use and be made to produce further de ductions while their value in practical work can be constantly exhibited All this gives the child a sense of increased ability progress life  which is so fascinating to him and to all of us It dispels the depressing feeling of futility which spoils so much of our work and makes the school room a treadmill But even in geometry the nature of the reasoning and its limitations are rarely sufficiently brought home to the learner He is allowed to go on without an idea of how much or how little he has proved How many for instance can explain why the induction of Euclid i 4 is a general truth not limited to the case of the two particular triangles Again in language analysis and parsing may afford excel lent examples of the application of general prin ciples to the explanation of particular cases as may the correction of sentences in which the grammar or arrangement is faulty But then we must be careful not to introduce distinctions which the language itself has never observed or has long ago discarded The new Eton Latin grammar is a terrible sinner in this respect with its aorist and its array of tenses in the infinitive And we must abandon all such rubbish as that the second of two nouns is put in the genitive As to how the grammar of the mothertongue or of any other tongue may be built up induc tively I need say nothing here I have already more than once enlarged on the topic Those who are still inquisitive as to my views and plans will find them fully set forth in my English 167 grammar for beginners 1 and my First lessons in French Our next stage consists of the criticism of the statements of others complex reasoning and chains of demonstration With regard to the two last I have already somewhat anticipated myself in what I have said about geometry and algebra With regard to the first I cannot do better than recommend exercises in the logical conversion of propositions and immediate inference The rules are simple and can be readily understood They will be found clearly set forth in Mr Jevonss little book lesson x From these we may pass to exercises in the detection of logical and material fallacies which will be found both entertaining and highly useful Mr Jevons gives all the help that will be needed in lessons xx and xxi and likewise supplies us with many excellent examples  which may be supplemented from the well chosen examples in Dr Rays handbook of De ductive logic published by Messrs Macmillan  Co Those which touch upon the personal ex perience of the learner will be the best With re gard to algebra and geometry I will merely add that I think the first lessons in each should be much more carefully treated than is usually the case In beginning algebra we pass from the particular instances and particular symbols of arithmetic to general cases of number and general symbols and we should be at the pains of making quite clear the nature of the change the enlarge ment of limits and the practical value of the new treatment All this is far too much hurried over as a rule and an excellent opportunity for exer cising the reasoning powers and for what is even more important exciting the curiosity of the pu pils and displaying the practical utility of the work about to be attempted is lost As professor De Morgan pointed out there is much to be learned from contrasting the proofs of   2  a or of a  b a  b  a2  b2 with similar propo sitions in arithmetic while the early introduction of problems involving simple equations is far more valuable and stimulating to the beginner than all the clearing of brackets and simplifying of frac tions and the rest with which he is usually in dulged The corresponding work in geometry is the passing from the particular cases and in ductions of practical to the deductions and general truths of theoretical work We should dwell upon the limitations of our earlier work the reasons why a practical proof such as that in 1 In especial I would refer to the carefully graded lessons by means of which I arrive at the definitions of the parts of speech and to the lessons which show how by induction we may and should arrive at the rules relating to the order of words in a sentence and to the use of stops FEBRUARY 18 1887168 S CIl Euclid i 4 holds generally while we need some thing more than practical experiment to prove say that vertically opposite angles are equal or that the three angles of any triangle are always together equal to two right angles The need for proofs that are generally true may be brought out very clearly in such a matter as the consideration of the best practical methods for measuring plane sur faces or some other similar work In any case let us bring home to the learner the need for more general proofs and the nature of the method adopted for obtaining them while all through our geometrical work let us keep in mind how refresh ing it is to be allowed toseeand appreciate the bear ing of theory on practice  the practical utility of the results cf our theoretical work Once again what better means can we have for exercising pu pils in mixed inductive and deductive reasoning than political economy We may begin with a story from Miss Martineaus collection or to be more precise we may take The shipwrecked sailors from Mrs Fawcetts Tales in political economy and work up to the question as to whether luxurious expenditure and waste are good for trade or to the great problem of demand and supply and the price of commodities  making deductions from the principles at which we arrive and testing them by comparison with the results of practical experience I will conclude by reminding you that for pure induction you will generally have to rely on the physical sciences of which botany energetics if I may use the word and chemistry will be the best for school purposes while for deduction the whole field of mathematics lies before you I may add that you will find an excellent model lesson in induction on the  piledriving machine in Professor Paynes  Lectures on education In mathematies perhaps the best and simplest ex ample of induction suitable to beginners is the wellknown  binomial theorem for positive in tegral indices H COURTHOPE BOWEN

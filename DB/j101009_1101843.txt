COMMONWEALTH V A BERSON et als November 15 1909 SundaysCriminal LawJewsHow Jewish Sabbath Reckoned Section 3800 of the Virginia Code of 1904 exempting Jews from the penalties prescribed for violating the Sunday laws provided they conscientiously believe that the seventh day of the week should be observed as a Sabbath day and provided further they do not com pel an apprentice or servant not of their belief to so labor contem plates the ecclesiastical Biblical or artificial day measured accord ing to the Jewish method of reckoning days consisting of twenty four hours and extending from sunset to sunset In other words if they observe that day so reckoned they incur no liability by en gaging in labor and business after sunset on every Saturday as well as the Sunday observed by the Christians Appeals from judgments of a Justice of the Peace on warrants charging Sabbath breaking J T LAWLESS Judge These cases are here on appeals from sundry judgments of a justice of the peace finding the accused guilty of the offense of violating  3799 of the Code of 1904 as amended by Acts of Assembly of 1908 p 258 which imposes a penalty for Sabbath breaking A jury is waived and the whole matter of law and fact submitted to the Court The facts are agreed They show that the accused are engaged in business as merchandise merchants in the County of Norfolk and that after sunset on Saturday and during the day commonly known as Sun day they engaged in bartering goods at their storehouses to public purchasers They performed this labor themselves and did not compel an apprentice or servant not of their religious belief so to do nor in performing it did they disturb any other person They are orthodox Jews who conscientiously believe that the seventh day of the week ought to be observed as a Sabbath day and who in good faith actually refrain thereon from all secular business and labor Various warrants charging them with violating the statute  3799 in thus laboring at their calling on the Sabbath day were served upon them and on the hearing they were adjudged guilty under each and a fine imposed To the several judgments of the justice of the peace they asked for and were granted appeals to this court The sole question presented by the appeals is whether or not the accused are exempt from the inhibition and penalty of the statute by reason of their conscentious belief that the seventh April 9201910 COMMONWEALTH V BERSON 921 day of the week should be observed as a Sabbath day notwith standing the admitted fact that they engage in labor and business after sunset on Saturday as well as on the Sunday observed by the Christians The two statutes defining the offense and designating the persons who are exempt from its penalty are as follows  3799 Violation of the Sabbath How PunishcdIf a person on the Sabbath day be found laboring at any trade or calling or employ his apprentice or servants in labor or other business except in household or other work of necessity or charity he shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be fined not less than five dollars for each offense Every day any person or servant or apprentice is so employed shall constitute a distinct offense and the court in which or the justice by whom any judgment of conviction is rendered may require the person so convicted a recognizance in a penalty of not less than one hundred or more than five thousand dollars with or without security conditioned that such person shall be of good behavior and especially to refrain from a repetition of such offense for a period not exceeding twelve months  3800 Excmption as to thc JewssThe forfeiture declared by the preceding section shall not be incurred by any person who conscientiously believes that the seventh day of the week ought to be observed as a Sabbath and actually refrains from all secular business and labor on that day provided he does not compel an apprentice or servant not of his belief to do secular work or business on a Sunday and does not on that day disturb any other person In construing these statutes no difficulty is presented against the conclusion that all persons whose religious convictions con strain them to keep and who do keep the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath day without disturbing other persons or requiring apprentices or servants not of their belief to then labor at their trade or calling are without the restriction and are exempt from the penalty of that first above quoted The difficulty arises in ascertaining from the second statute whether it means a civil day or a religious or artificial day in its use of that termin other words in determining when the seventh day of the week mentioned in the statute begins and ends The Commonwealth contends that this day in contemplation of law means the commonlaw natural or civil day consisting of twentyfour hours and extending from midnight to midnight that this day is punctum tciiporis and the law knows no fraction of it and that the accused must refrain from labor and business during every hour of this day beginning at midnight Friday 215 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER and extending to midnight Saturday before they can claim the exemption On the other hand the accused contend that the exempting statute contemplates the ecclesiastical Biblical or artificial lay measured according to the Jewish method of reckoning days consisting of twentyfour hours and extending from sunset to sunset and that having observed that day they are exempt from the penalty of the statute under which they were convicted Bearing in mind the history of these statutes and the familiar principle that there are no constructive offences and that in order to convict a person of crime the offence charged must come plainly within the letter and spirit of the penalizing law Suther land v Corn 65 S E 16 the court is of opinion that the con tention of the accused is sound and that on the case agreed they are not guilty as charged in the warrants and must be dis charged from custody At common law the legal right existed in all persons to enter into contracts to engage in works of labor and to prosecute generally their usual business or calling on Sunday the Dies Solis of Dies Dominiicus of the Christians Note to Lee Taylor  Sneal v Willis 6 Va L R 692 Eden v People 52 A S R 365 Friedborn v Com 57 A R 467 quoting Lord Mansfield on the English Statute In order to restrict this natural right of the citizen and enforce a general observance of Sunday or the first day of the week as a day of rest it was necessary for the General Assembly of the Commonwealth in common with other states to enact a statute to that end In this legislation which was enacted in 1779 12 Henings St at Large 286 the lawmaking body of Virginia evidently had as its prototype the English statute of 29 Charles II c 7 which is similar to though not identical with the statute under consideration Wells v Com at 590 Note 6 Va L R 692 supra That the statute until its companion statute was enacted operated alike upon all persons without distinction of sectarian beliefs is apparent from the opinions of the judges in the adjudicated cases Note to Com v Kirshen 10 A  E Anno Cases 948 It is plain also that its operation upon such classes of persons who because of conscientious scruples were constrained to keep the seventh in stead of the first day of the week as a Sabbath day was in effect a discrimination and hardship in that they were required first by conscience and next by law to observe two days instead of one as days of rest Note to Liberman v State 18 A S R at 795 and cases cited See also State v B  O R R Co W Va 36 A R at page 814 It was out of this condition that arose the exception to the general rule which is found in  3800 of the Code of 1904 as amended by Acts 1908 p 258 In April 922COMMONWEALTH V BERSON enacting this exceptive statute the lawmaking power it seems to me must of necessity have had in view a purpose to correct the mischief of compelling by law persons of a certain religous belief concerning the Sabbath to observe and refrain from work and business on Sunday when those persons of their own motion conscientiously observed in similar manner a different day and to set apart for them the day of their own choosing and after requiring them to observe that day as one of rest to leave them free to exercise their common law rights as to secular matters on all other days of the week In other words the exceptive legislation found its inspiration in a recognition of and a respect for the religious scruples of a portion of the people and in en acting it the General Assembly male a technical use of the words seventh day of the week and intended the religious day of the sects sought to be exempted and not the natural or civil day familiar to the common law While evidently inspired by a re spect for the religious views of the majority of the people of the community the obvious purpose of the general statute  3799 requiring the nonperformance of work and other business on the Sabbath was not to enforce the observance of a religious or moral duty for the exception to it expressly provides that any person may neglect it who will rest the required oneseventh part of his time Had the legislature sought to impose the observance of the Sabbath as a tenet of religion it would have been violative of the constitutional rights of the people as they have always been guaranteed Va Const Art 1  16 Art IV  58 This has been repeatedly held by courts of last resort in other jurisdictions State v Weiss 97 Minn 125 Note to S C 1 A  E Anno Cases 934 Petit v Minnesota 177 U S 164 In construing a cognate statute taken almost in totidcin vcrbis from our own law the learned Judge Green of the Supreme Court of West Virginia in The State v B  O R R Co 15 W Va at p 383 says It was obviously not intended by our statute to enforce the observance of a religous duty The Legislature obviously re garded it as promotive of the mental moral and physical well being of men that they should rest from their labors at stated intervals and in this all experience shows they were right The following expression from the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in the case of Comr v Has 122 Mass 40 7 A  E A Cases 935 note will suffice on the point It is essentially a civil regulation providing for a fixed period of rest in the business the ordinary avocations and the amuse ments of the communtiy If there be such a cessation from labor and amusement some one day must be selected for the purpose and even if the day thus selected is chosen because a great 1910 92315 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER majority of the people celebrate it as a day of perculiar sanctity the legislative authority to provide for its observance is derived from the general authority to regulate the business of the com munity and to provide for its moral and physical welfare See also N  W Ry Co z Corn 93 Va 749 When therefore it appeared that a certain class observed as a religious duty a day in each week other than that which in the exercise of the police power they were required to observe by law tile object of the statute was accomplished and hence the exception to it was enacted which exempted that class from its provisions The legal reason of the law being founded on public policy it was within the power of the legislature to have set apart for observance by the excepted class any other lay of the week than the seventh lay if the mischief sought to be remedied had so required And if in the exercise of this power the second or sixth day for example had been designated and had even been defined to comprehend a commonlaw civil day beginning at midnight and extending over a period of twentyfour hours it would hardly be maintained that observers of that day would not be free to exercise their natural rights on every other day of the week HoNwever the contention of the Commonwealth is that the accused having been engaged in selling goods on Saturday after the hour of sunset have not observed the seventh day of the week as required by  3800 and are therefore not immune from the penalty provided in  3799 for violations of the Chris tian Sabbath This contention constrains the inquiry At what period of time within the twentyfour hours does the seventh day of the week mentioned in the statute begin and end While broad enough in its terms to comprehend other denominations that the day means the seventh clay of the week as under stood and observed by the Jews is clear from the caption of the law as it appears in the Code of 1904 Section 3800 ExcePtion as to Jews is the title of the section This caption is also to be found in the Code of 1887 the revisors of that codification of the laws who were very learned lawyers having adopted the parti cular caption quoted It is not found in the preceding Codes In Shumates Case 15 G at page 658 the court held that the captions to be found in the Code may be looked to as showing the contemporaneous construction of statutes made by the revisors when engaged in the work of revision See also dissenting opin ion of Buchanan J in Wells v Corn supra What then was this particular day of the Jews in point of time  Alexander Cruden in his Concordance to the Holy Scriptures at page 501 under the title Sabbath says 924 AprilCOMMONWEALTH V BERSON The Jews gave the name of Parasceve to the sixth day of the week because being not allowed on the Sabbath to prepare their food they provided the day before what was necessary for their subsistence on the Sabbath The Evangelist John says that Friday on which our Saviour suffered was the preparation of the passover John 19 14 because the passover was to be cele brated the day following St Matthew marks out the day by these words The day that followed the Parasceve Mat 27 62 All the Evangelists observe that they delayed to take down Christ from the cross and to put him in the nearest tomb be cause it was the evening of the Parasceve and that the Sabbath was to begin immediately after the setting of the sun or the rising of the stars In the Cyclopedia of Biblical Theological  Ecclesiastical Literature Vol IX p 190 under Sabbath the authors say This was the seventh day of the Hebrew week extending from sunset on Friday to sunset on Saturday Comp Lev XXIII 32 and see Lightfoot Hor Hcbr p 312 sq The same authors vol 2 p 702 under the subject Day say The variable length of the natural day at different seasons led in the very earliest times to the adoption of the civil day or one revolution of the sun as a standard of time The commence ment of the civil day varied in different nations the Babylonians like the people of Nuremberg reckoned it from sunrise to sun rise Isidor Orig v 30 The Umbrians from noon to noon the Romans from midnight to midnight Pliny II 79 The Athenians and others from sunset to sunset Macrob Saturn 1 3 Gell III 2 The Hebrews adopted the latter reckoning Lev XXIII 32 from even to even shall ye celebrate your Sabbath which appears even in Gen 1 5 etc After a brief attempt to reconcile the reason for these methods of beginning and ending the day and asserting that no absolute rule can be laid down with respect to the commencement of the civil day and that usage varied somewhat with the customs of the people among whom the Hebrews were for the time sojourning the authors continue The prevalent method of computation however is evinced by the fact that the Jewish Civil day still begins not with the morning but the eveningthus the Sabbath commences with the sunset of Friday and ends with the sunset of Saturday That this was the case in Judaea in our Saviors day is evident from the evangelists account of the Passion In New England the same mode of reckoning the Sabbath was common So scrupulously was the day observed that as the apostle Mat thew relates Mat VIII 16 the Sabbatarian Pharisees were led to settle the minutest rules for ascertaining the actual instant 1910 92515 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER when the day began It was defined to be the time between the actual sunset and the appearance of three certain stars and the Talmudists held that on the evening of the Sabbath if a man per formed work after the appearance of one star he was forgiven if he continued his labor after the appearance of the second star he was adjudged guilty of a doubtful transgression and was re quired to offer a sacrifice if after the appearance of the third star he still continued his labor he was required to offer a sin offering Idem p 703 Dr S R Driver D D Regius Professor of Hebrew Oxford 1905 in an article on the Sabbath in A Dictionary of the Bible edited by Hastings says inter alia The Jewish day began at sunset in the evening the Sabbath lasted from sunset on what we would call Friday to sunset on Saturday   Under the word Sabbath in 5 Century Dict p 5286 appears the following The Sabbath he AMr Cotton began the evening before ior which keeping of the Sabbath from evening to evening he wrote arguments before his coming to New England and I suppose twas from his reason and practice that the Christians of New England have generally done so too C Mather Mag Chris III 1 The Lords Day was strictly observed as a Sabbath accord ing to the Puritan view that its observance was enjoined in the decalogue The Sabbath extended from the sunset of Saturday to the sunset of Sunday according to the Jewish method of reckoning days G P Fisher Hist of Christian Church 468 It is unnecessary to multiply the authorities on the point So far as the court is advised they are but expressive of the universally recognized fact that the Jewish seventh day begins at sunset Friday and ends at sunset of the next day and has been observed as such from the earliest days of recorded time The two statutes were enacted about seventy years apart The use of the word Sabbath in the general statute enacted in 1799 must be taken to mean the Sabbath observed by the great majority of the people at that time the observance of which it compelled But the use of the same word in the exemptive statute passed in 1849 Code 1849 p 741 is qualified by the clause the seventh day of the week and must be construed not only with that clause in view but also in the light of the mischief it was intended to remedy The legislature was of course aware that the excepted class comprising any person who conscientiously believes that the seventh day of the week ought to be observed as a Sabbath would continue to observe the day after the manner of their April 926COMMONWEALTH V BERSON forefathers from the remotest generations of mankind It was aware that this seventh day began and ended at points of time different from those which marked the civil day of the municipal law With this knowledge it enacted that persons who observed this seventh day should be exempt from the penalty denounced in the general statute and it therefore follows that the ac cused on the case agreed are within the protection of the ex ceptive statute and are not guilty as charged in the warrants Note Sunday Laws as Applicable to JewsSunday statutes in many other states except from their operation persons who observe the seventh day as the Sabbath But in the absence of such an exception Jews Seventh Day Adventists and others who conscientiously observe the seventh day instead of the first day of the week are as much bound as others Specht v Cor 8 Pa 312 Society for Visitation etc v Com 52

open of a shop for any purposes of business on the Lords day it is not competent to show that the accused was a Jew and that he actually observed the seventh day of the week and kept his shop open for the sole purpose of selling meat to Hebrews and that this was a work of necessity and charity where the act does not contain the exception of works of necessity and charity Commonwealth v Starr 144 Mass 361 Even if there is an exception the fact that a person believes the seventh day to be the Sabbath but does not observe same will not bring him within the exception Liberman v State 26 Neb 464 18 Am St Rep 791 And in the absence of proof it will not be presumed that the ac cused comes within the exception of a statute as to those conscien tiously observing the seventh day as a Sabbath the rule being that where the proviso of a criminal or penal statute exempting certain persons or cases from its operation is disconnected from the statutory description of the offense the burden of showing the exemption is on the party claiming it Sayre v Wheeler 31 Iowa 112 114 The exception only protects them for acts cof secular labor on the Lords day provided they violate no other law Therefore it is no defense for a licensed dealer for his violation of the law respecting the sale of intoxicants on Sunday Cor v Hyneman 101 Mass 30 And under a statute prohibiting certain acts and among them the keeping open of a shop on the Lords day but containing an exemption as to Jews conscientiously observing the seventh day and permitting the performance of secular business travel or labor on the Lords day provided he disturbs no other person it was held not to permit the keeping open of a shop The court said While those who for con scienticus reasons observe the seventh day of the week as the Sab bath may do business or perform labor which does not interfere with others they are not entitled by keeping open their shops to invite the violation of the Provisions of the act even if their ordinary business is shopkeeping Commonwealth v Has 122 Mass Rep 40 41 And even though accused keeps his workshops closed to the public on the first day of the week but opens it in the morning and evening to allow his employees who wish to work to enter and leave he is 1910 927928 15 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER April guilty of keeping open his workshop for business Com v Kirshen Mass 80 N

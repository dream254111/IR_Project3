FOR THE PRESS A VOLUME WHICH WILL PRESENT IN ENGLISH DRESS THE ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF PUBLIC RELIEF AND PRIVATE PHILANTHROPY IN EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN COUNTRIES 1363THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY INTO THIS STATEMENT BY REASON OF YEARS OF STUDY WE ARE COMING TO KNOW WHAT MEASURES ARE PREVENTIVE THESE ARE PRACTICAL AND ECONOMICAL HAD THEY BEEN KNOWN AND COULD THEY HAVE BEEN ADOPTED A GENERATION AGO WE SHOULD HAVE A MUCH SMALLER NUMBER OF DEPENDENTS TO CARE FOR NOW IF NOW THAT WE KNOW THEM WE UTILIZE THESE PREVENTIVE MEASURES THERE WILL BE A GREAT DECREASE OF DEPENDENTS IN THE NEXT GENERATION2 THE LAST CENTURY RIPENED THE PRODUCTS OF GROWTHS WHICH ROOT THEMSELVES IN THE PERIOD ANTERIOR TO THE REFORMATION POOR RELIEF IN THE HISTORY OF CHRISTIAN PEOPLES HAS ASSUMED THREE TYPES IN RESPONSE TO CHANGING SOCIAL CONDITIONS THE VOLUNTARY AND CONGRE GATIONAL CHARITY OF THE EARLY CHURCHES BEFORE CONSTANTINE THE MEDIAEVAL ECCLESIASTICAL METHODS OF PARISHES BISHOPS MONASTERIES ORDERS AND INSTITUTIONS AND THE MODERN LAIC AND POLITICAL POOR RELIEF SUPPORTED BY TAXATION AND SUPPLEMENTED BY INDIVIDUAL AND VOLUNTARY CHARITY THE PEOPLES OF NORTHERN EUROPE LARGELY TEU TONIC AND PROTESTANT HAVE CARRIED THE SYSTEM OF PUBLIC RELIEF MUCH FARTHER THAN THE ROMANCE COUNTRIES OF SOUTHERN EUROPE BUT FRANCE AND ITALY HAVE EMBARKED UPON THE SAME VOYAGE URGED BY THE SAME FORCES IN GERMANY THE NATIONAL FEELING WHICH CREATED A CENTRAL LEGISLATURE AT BERLIN A SUPREME COURT AT LEIPSIC AND AN IMPERIAL ARMY AND NAVY COULD NOT BROOK THE SPECTACLE OF A SUFFERING CITIZEN WITHOUT RIGHT TO RELIEF IN WHATEVER STATE OR COMMUNE HE MIGHT FALL INTO DESTITUTION OR NEGLECTED BY CHANCE INDIVIDUAL CHARITY BE DRIVEN TO STEAL THE IMPERIAL POOR LAW AND THE WORKINGMENS INSURANCE MEASURES ARE EXPRESSIONS OF A CIVIC CONSCIENCE AS WELL AS OF A CON SCIOUSNESS OF COMMON INTEREST THE CREATIVE THOUGHT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE MERELY TO SECURE BETTER ADMINISTRATION BUT TO FULFILL A NATIONAL OBLIGATION SO LONG AS THERE IS NO LEGAL SYSTEM WITH A BASIS IN UNI VERSAL TAXATION MULTITUDES OF THE DESTITUTE MUST BE EXPOSED TO ALL THE UNCERTAIN CHANCES OF LIBERALITY OR NEGLECT WHICH CHARACTERIZE VOLUNTARY

IMPLY THE SUPPRESSION OF PRIVATE AND ECCLESIASTICAL BENEVOLENCE BUT ONLY A BETTER UNDERSTANDING AND DIVISION OF LABOR A DEMARCATION OF SPHERES OF INFLUENCE AND ACTIVITY THE GERMAN EVANGELICAL INNER MISSION FOR EXAMPLE THE RAPID MULTIPLICATION OF ENGLISH PHILAN THROPIC ENTERPRISES AND THE DEVOTION OF MEANS AND PERSONAL SERVICE IN AMERICA SHOW THAT A PUBLIC SYSTEM HAS STRICT LIMITATIONS AND THAT THE SAME CIVIC CONSCIENCE WHICH SUPPORTS A POOR RATE ALSO CALLS FOR PERSONAL AND ASSOCIATED EFFORTS TOO DELICATE FOR THE RUDE AND CUMBROUS MACHINERY OF THE STATE THE SAME TENDENCIES ARE AT WORK 366

BEEN AWAKENED TO TAKE TO HEART ITS ANCIENT TASK OF MINISTRY TO THE POOR IT IS TRUE THAT THESE TWO SYSTEMS HAVE GROWN UP SOMEWHAT INDEPENDENT OF EACH OTHER AND SOMETIMES THERE IS CONFLICT OR COMPETI TION BETWEEN THEM EVEN GERMAN MUNICIPAL COUNCILLORS MAY BE HEARD TO COMPLAIN THAT THE CHURCH PARISHES ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH LARGE FUNDS DO NOT COOPERATE WITH EACH OTHER OR WITH THE CITY IN AN HAR MONIOUS PLAN OF HELPING THE POOR IN THE UNITED STATES WHERE THE HORROR OF BUREAUCRACY IS SO STRONG WE HAVE RECONCILED OURSELVES TO THE TYRANNY AND CORRUPTION OF BOSSISM AND SPOILS EVILS UNKNOWN IN GERMAN ADMINISTRATION OF POOR RELIEF IN MANY PLACES OUR EFFORTS TO SECURE INFORMATION TO WHICH EVERY TAXPAYER HAS A MORAL AND LEGAL RIGHT ARE OFTEN TREATED WITH THAT INSOLENCE WHICH IS EVIDENCE THAT INVESTIGATION IS BOTH HATED AND FEARED IN MANY PLACES NO STATISTICS OF VALUE ARE KEPT AND ORIGINAL RECORDS ARE BURNED AT FREQUENT INTER VALS ON THE PLEA THAT UNFORTUNATE CITIZENS IN NEED OF HELP SHOULD NOT HAVE THEIR NAMES KEPT IN A PUBLIC RECORD IN GERMAN CITIES THE FEELINGS OF DEPENDENTS ARE FAR MORE RESPECTED THAN HERE AND THE ADMINISTRATION IS PRACTICALLY EFFECTIVE THROUGH VOLUNTARY AND UNPAID VISITORS CAREFULLY SELECTED BY THE AUTHORITIES THE CHARITY ORGANIZATION SOCIETY IS THEREFORE CALLED FOR NOT ONLY IN GREAT BRITAIN AND AMERICA BUT EVEN IN COUNTRIES LIKE GER MANY WHERE ITS PRINCIPLES ARE ACTUALLY EMBODIED IN THE PUBLIC SYS TEM INDEED THE ORGANIZATION MOVEMENT IS AS WIDE AS CIVILIZATION IT IS AN EFFORT TO SYNTHETIZE THE SEPARATELY EVOLVED AGENCIES OF STATE CHURCH AND PRIVATE ASSOCIATIONS ANOTHER ILLUSTRATION OF THE TENDENCY TO FEDERATION OF PHILAN THROPY TO FORM TRUSTS OF CHARITY MAY BE TAKEN FROM A RECENT ORGANIZATION OF CHILDSAVING SOCIETIES IN THE MIDDLE WEST THE BELIEF THAT THE BEST PLACE FOR A NORMAL DEPENDENT CHILD IS NOT IN A LARGE COLD STORAGE ESTABLISHMENT BUT IN A WARM AND REAL FAMILY HOME HAS EVERYWHERE TAKEN DEEP ROOT AS THE NUMBER OF HOME LESS CHILDREN INCREASES WITH POPULATION AND AS NEIGHBORHOOD TIES ARE BROKEN UP BY THE INCIDENTS OF A SHIFTING URBAN LIFE THE NECESSITY FOR ORGANIZED EFFORT TO FIND NEW HOMES SELECT THEM CAREFULLY AND SUPERVISE THEM THOROUGHLY HAS BECOME GENERALLY APPARENT EVEN WHERE THE STATE AS IN MICHIGAN WISCONSIN AND MINNESOTA HAS 367 25THZE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY PROVIDED A TEMPORARY SCHOOL AND

ASSOCIATIONS OF THE SAME TYPE HAVE SPRUNG UP IN THE VAST PLAIN DRAINED BY THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER SOME OF THESE SOCIETIES WERE ADMIRABLY MANAGED FROM THEIR EXPERIMENTAL BEGINNINGS WHILE OTHERS WERE CONDUCTED BY PERSONS WHO HAD INADE QUATE CONCEPTIONS OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES THEY WERE ASSUMING OCCASIONALLY DOWNRIGHT DISHONESTY HAS BEEN DISCOVERED THERE ARE STILL VERY LARGE AREAS ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTH IN WHICH MANY LITTLE WAIFS ARE THRUST INTO POORHOUSES AND EVEN JAILS AND ARE WITHOUT ORGANIZED MEANS OF PLACING OUT THE HELPLESS AND HOMELESS THE NECESSITY FOR FEDERATION IN ORDER TO CORRECT ABUSES GUIDE ACTION AND ENLARGE THE FIELD OF LABOR BECAME MANIFEST TO MANY PERSONS AND THESE FORMED THE NATIONAL CHILDRENS HOME SOCIETY ON THE BASIS OF A FORMER SOCIETY THE IDEALS OF THIS ORGANIZATION

DISCUSSION GROWS HOT IN THE UNITED STATES THE PROBLEM OF STATE SUPERVISION AND CONTROL OF PUBLIC AND EVEN PRIVATE PHILANTHROPY AND RELIEF5 IT IS EASILY SHOWN THAT WE HAVE HERE ONE PHASE OF A WORLD MOVEMENT 5 SEE  NY STATE LIBRARY BULLETIN 72 MARCH I902 368 26WORLD CURRENTS IN CHARITY THEORY AND PRACTICE THE AGITATION EXCITEMENT AND EVEN THE IRRITATION OF THE DEBATE WILL CONDUCT US TOWARD A SOBER AND PROFITABLE CONSIDERATION OF THE EXPERI ENCE OF CIVILIZED NATIONS ESPECIALLY OF THOSE WHERE THE SCIENCE OF ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN MORE FULLY DEVELOPED THAN WITH US SO GREAT IS THE INTEREST IN THIS SUBJECT THAT THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF CHARITIES AND CORRECTION APPOINTED A SPECIAL COMMITTEE TO STUDY AND REPORT FOR DISCUSSION AT THE ATLANTA MEETING ALTHOUGH A VERY STRONG DEBATE WAS HEARD LAST YEAR AT DETROIT AND THE NATIONAL PRISON ASSOCIATION WILL ALSO DISCUSS A REPORT OF A SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON THE SAME THEME AT LOUISVILLE IN SEPTEMBER IN IOWA AND MINNESOTA THE LEGISLATURES HAVE FOLLOWED THE EXAMPLE OF KANSAS AND WISCONSIN IN SUBSTITUTING A PAID BOARD OF CONTROL FOR AN UNPAID BOARD OF SUPERVISION NEW YORK NEW JERSEY AND NEBRASKA ARE AT THIS TIME WEIGHING THE ARGUMENTS FOR BOTH PLANS AND UNITY IS FAR FROM REALIZATION SOME ILLUSTRATIONS FROM THE OLDER COUNTRIES MAY SERVE TO LIGHT THE WAY TO SECURE GROUND IN A STUDY BY THE PRESENT WRITER WHICH IS NOW IN THE HANDS OF THE PUBLIC PRINTER AT WASHINGTON THE DOCU MENTS RELATING TO CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION OF PENAL AND CORRECTIONAL ESTABLISHMENTS WILL BE COLLECTED AND MADE ACCESSIBLE TO READERS OF ENGLISH AND THERE IT WILL BE SHOWN WITH CONSIDERABLE DETAIL THAT IN ESTABLISHMENTS OF THIS CLASS THE NECESSITY FOR CENTRAL CONTROL HAS BEEN EVERYWHERE LEGALLY RECOGNIZED EXCEPT IN THE UNITED STATES IN GERMANY ALONE THERE IS NO SUCH SYSTEM OF PUBLIC SUPERVISION AND REPORTS IN RELATION TO OUTDOOR RELIEF EXCEPT IN BAVARIA THIS DEFECT SEEMS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE MUNICIPAL RELIEF SYSTEM HAS REACHED A HIGH DEGREE OF PERFECTION IS BASED ON A COMMON POOR LAW AND IS SO INDEPENDENT OF VOLUNTARY CHARITY THAT NO SERIOUS DEMAND IS MADE FOR STATE SUPERVISION OF ADMINISTRATION IT IS ADMITTED HOWEVER BY HIGH AUTHORITIES THAT NOT ONLY RURAL RELIEF BUT EVEN URBAN ADMINIS TRATION WOULD OFTEN BE IMPROVED BY THE REQUIREMENT OF INSPECTION AND UNIFORM REPORTS OF STATISTICS SUCH INSPECTION AND EVEN CONTROL IS CARRIED VERY FAR IN GREAT BRITAIN THE BITTER AND COSTLY EXPERIENCE UNDER THE LAX METHODS PREVIOUS TO I834 TAUGHT THE ENGLISH PEOPLE A LESSON WHICH THEY HAVE NOT YET FORGOTTEN THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE INDEED MUCH RESPONSIBILITY AND FREEDOM OF INITIATIVE BUT OVER ENGLAND AND WALES THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD EXERCISES CONTROL UNDER A GENERAL LAW AND A SIMILAR SYSTEM IS ORGANIZED BOTH IN SCOTLAND AND IRELAND FOR THE INSPECTION OF CARE OF CHILDREN 369 27THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY AND FAMILIES WOMEN ARE FREQUENTLY APPOINTED AND WITH EXCELLENT RESULTS IN AUSTRIA STATE COMMISSIONS HAVE INSPECTORS OF LOCAL RELIEF OFFICERS AND THEY SECURE UNIFORM IMPARTIAL AND EFFICIENT ADMINISTRA TION OF THE LAW LOCAL OFFICIALS THERE AS EVERYWHERE AS A RULE LACK TRAINING RELIABILITY AND ACCURACY AS COMPARED WITH CENTRAL

OUR PEOPLE ARE NOW ENGAGED THOSE WHO IMAGINE THAT THE MOST PERFECTLY DISCIPLINED ADMINIS TRATORS IN THE WORLD PERMIT THEMSELVES TO EXECUTE LAW EXEMPT FROM THE INFLUENCE OF COMPETENT CITIZENS WOULD DO WELL TO STUDY THE NUMEROUS ORGANIZATIONS WHICH HELP TO BRING GOVERNMENT INTO TOUCH WITH DAILY LIFE THE GERMAN IMPERIAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS HAVE LONG SINCE DEVELOPED VARIOUS DEVICES FOR THE REPRESENTATION OF INTERESTS AND OF EXPERT KNOWLEDGE BOTH IN THE PREPARATION OF LEGIS LATION AND THE EXECUTION OF LAWS AS IN RELATION TO COLONIES EMIGRA TION BOARDS OF TRADE INSURANCE PUBLIC HEALTH WELFARE OF WORKING MEN POSTAL SERVICE AGRICULTURE RAILROADS AND STOCK RAISING6 IF UNDER THE MOST SCIENTIFIC SYSTEMS OF ADMINISTRATION BOTH SPECIAL COMMERCIAL AND PUBLIC INTERESTS REQUIRE

AS TO POLICIES AND RESULTS IN THE CONTROVERSY MUCH CONFUSION HAS BEEN INTRODUCED INTO PAPERS AND HOT SPEECHES BY FAIL URE TO NOTE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE AIMS OF CONSTITUTIONAL AND POPULAR GOVERNMENTS DR F H WINES BROUGHT OUT THE POINT AT DETROIT AND IT OUGHT TO BE INSISTED ON TO THE END PUBLIC CONTROL OF ADMINISTRATION MUST BE IN THE HANDS OF SALARIED EXPERTS AGENCIES OF PUBLIC OPINION SHOULD NOT BE PAID UNLESS FOR ACTUAL EXPENSES AND THEY NEED NOT BE PROFESSIONALS IN OUR JUDICIAL EXPERIENCE WE RECOG NIZE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE JUDGE AND THE ORDINARY JURYMAN IN MUNICIPAL ADMINISTRATION WE HAVE SALARIED ENGINEERS AND EXPERT ACCOUNTANTS ON ONE SIDE AND REPRESENTATIVES OF CITIZENS ON THE OTHER IN MOST STATE AND NATIONAL AFFAIRS THE SAME DISTINCTION IS FAMILIAR A DEMOCRACY IS COMPETENT TO JUDGE OF POLICIES AND RESULTS IF IT HAS MEANS OF INFORMATION AND IT WILL NOT LONG TOLERATE GROSS EVILS IF THEY ARE SIMPLY BROUGHT TO LIGHT BUT IN THE WORK OF ACTUAL ADMINISTRATION A BODY OF PROFESSIONAL SALARIED MEN IS REQUIRED MEN WHO SPECIALIZE THEIR WORK AND GIVE THEMSELVES WHOLLY TO IT IN THE SOCIAL ENTERPRISES OF PUBLIC RELIEF INDOOR AND OUTDOOR THE SAME DIS

THEIR OWN CONDUCT IN OFFICE AND BE PERMITTED TO EXERCISE IRRESPONSIBLE POWER WHEN OFFICIALS RESENT INTERFERENCE FROM OUT SIDE THE ALARM SHOULD BE SOUNDED FROM EVERY HOME A DEMOCRACY CANNOT DICTATE A SYSTEM OF MEDICAL PRACTICE BUT IT CAN JUDGE OF A POLICY WHEN ITS FRUITS ARE MADE KNOWN IN COMPARATIVE TABLES OF SICKNESS AND MORTALITY THE GREAT PUBLIC IS AWKWARD ENOUGH AND SOMETIMES FOOLISH BUT IT IS COMPETENT TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BAD AND GOOD MANAGEMENT OF AN INSTITUTION BY COMPARING THE USE MADE OF SEVERITY AND VIOLENCE TO SECURE ORDER AND IN THE INCREASE OR DECREASE OF DISEASE DUE TO FILTH OR NEGLECT THEREFORE GRANTING AS THE PRESENT WRITER DOES THAT STATE BOARDS OF CONTROL PROPERLY ORGAN IZED ARE DEMANDED BY THE TEACHINGS OF WORLD EXPERIENCE IT MUST ALSO BE INSISTED THAT THIS CONCESSION DOES NOT TOUCH THE QUESTION OF SUPERVISION BOARDS OF CONTROL ARE SALARIED ADMINISTRATORS AND IF KEPT IN OFFICE LONG ENOUGH MAY BECOME EXPERTS BUT WHEN INFALLIBILITY IS CLAIMED FOR THEM WITH AUDACITY OF ASSERTION AND PAUCITY OF PROOF WE MUST INSIST AGAIN ON THE ARGUMENT THAT NO BODY OF OFFICIALS HAS A MORAL RIGHT TO PASS ON THEIR OWN CONDUCT OF AFFAIRS THE FACT IS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE BOARDS OF CONTROL IN ALL THE STATES PERHAPS TOO MANY OF THEM AND THE NEW MOVEMENT IS SIMPLY ONE TO CONSOLIDATE THEM PAY THEM AND SECURE THE ADVANTAGES OF ECONOMY AND RESPONSIBILITY WHICH ARE LIKELY TO RESULT FROM THE PROPOSED ARRANGEMENT IT IS PROBABLE THAT A BOARD OF CONTROL FOR EACH GREAT GROUP OF PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS PENAL SANITARY EDUCATIONAL CHARITABLE AGRICULTURAL ETC MAY PROVE TO BE A WISE MEASURE AND EXPERIMENTS ARE ALREADY ON TRIAL TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS BUT THE INTELLIGENT FRIENDS OF THE POOR AND HELPLESS MUST HOLD TOGETHER IN MAKING THE DEMAND THAT THE VOLUNTARY SERVICE OF INTELLIGENT AND BENEVOLENT REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PUBLIC SHALL ALSO BE LEGALLY RECOG NIZED AND BOARDS OF CONTROL SHOULD BE THE FIRST TO INSIST ON THIS PRINCIPLE THERE ARE OF COURSE VARIOUS METHODS OF ORGANIZING FOR FREE AND INDEPENDENT INSPECTION OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION THUS IN THE ENGLISH PRISON SYSTEM A BOARD OF VISITORS HAS CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE ON THE CONTINENT OF EUROPE THE SOCIETIES OF PATRONAGE FOR AIDING PRISONERS AND THEIR FAMILIES HAVE LONG EXERCISED A WHOLESOME INFLUENCE ON PENAL ESTABLISHMENTS AND LEGISLATION AND MORE THAN ONCE HAVE BROKEN THROUGH THE CRUST OF CUSTOM WHICH OFTEN PREVENTS THE 372 30WORLD CURRENTS IN CHARITY THEORY AND PRACTICE GROWTH OF IDEAS IN OFFICIALDOM IP GERMAN PUBLIC CHARITY THE VOLUN TARY HONOR OFFICE IS A LARGE FACTOR AND THE BUREAUCRACY IF THEY HAVE ANY DISTRUST OR ENVY SEEM TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN HIDING THEIR FEELINGS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY THE BOARDS OF COUNTY VISITORS IN CER TAIN STATES HAVE ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED MUCH GOOD HAVE EXPOSED ABUSES HAVE WAKENED SLEEPY OFFICERS AND HAVE COLLECTED FACTS OF IMMENSE IMPORTANCE TO LEGISLATURES THE NEW YORK CHARITIES AID ASSOCIATION IS A TYPICAL EXAMPLE OF AN INDEPENDENT SOCIETY LEGALLY RECOGNIZED AND EXERCISING VAST INFLUENCE VARIOUS PRISON SOCIETIES BELONG TO THE SAME TYPE THE DANGERS WHICH MAY BE EXPECTED ESPECIALLY IN AMERICA FROM BOARDS OF CONTROL WITHOUT LEGAL AND CAPABLE AGENCIES OF SUPER VISION ARE SUCH AS THE FOLLOWING A BOARD WHICH INSPECTS AUDITS AND PASSES ON ITS OWN DEEDS WITHOUT CHECK SOON COMES TO FEEL THAT IT IS INFALLIBLE AND OMNISCIENT OR IF IT ESCAPE THIS FOIBLE IT IS MORE THAN HUMAN ONE WHO IS NEVER CONTRADICTED MAY BE EXCUSED IF HE RAPIDLY ACQUIRES PROFOUND CONFIDENCE IN HIS OWN JUDGMENT THEY SOON FEEL THE WARM GLOW OF SATISFACTION IN THE USE OF UNOBSTRUCTED POWER IT IS A RARE ABSOLUTIST SOVEREIGN WHO BEGS FOR A CONSTITUTION STRONG MEN LIKE BISMARCK CHAFED AT THE DELAYS OF PARLIAMENTARY QUESTIONERS IT IS ASSERTED ALREADY BY MEN NEAR THE HEART OF SECRETS THAT THERE ARE GENTLEMEN WHO RATHER ENJOY SEEING SUPERINTENDENTS OF ASYLUMS AND HOSPITALS PARTY LEADERS LEGISLATORS OFFICE SEEKERS CONTRACTORS AND EVEN STATE UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTS COOLING THEIR HEELS IN THE ANTEROOM OF THE STAR CHAMBER OF A STATE BOARD OF CONTROL EVEN IF THE TESTIMONY IS QUESTIONED THIS RESULT IS INEVITABLE SECRECY THE CLOUD WHICH HIDES ALL PERILS AND ABUSES IS UNAVOID ABLE WITH A BOARD OF CONTROL WITHOUT A LEGAL METHOD OF SUPERVISION INDEPENDENT OF IT REPORTS ON FORMS PROVIDED BY STATUTE ARE DECEP TIVE THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR THE INSPECTION OF A LIVING PERSON PARTISANSHIP IS CHARGED FOR THE BIPARTISAN BOARD IS BY NO MEANS SYNONYMOUS WITH NONPARTISAN WHEN IT COMES TO REDEEMING ANTE ELECTION PLEDGES BY THE PARTY IN POWER SUCH ARE THE FEARS OF MOST STUDENTS OF THE SITUATION AND THE FACT THAT THE NEW BOARDS HAVE REALLY RENDERED IMPORTANT SERVICES DURING THE SHORT TRIAL DOES NOT QUIET ANXIETY IT FOLLOWS FROM THE PRINCIPLE OF SOCIAL INTEREST AND SOLIDARITY OF RESPONSIBILITY THAT PRIVATE CHARITIES MUST ULTIMATELY BE SUBJECTED TO GOVERNMENTAL SUPERVISION AND CONTROL THIS SUGGESTION WILL BE 373 3ITHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY RESENTED BY THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP IN THE FRONTIER CON DITIONS OF A NEW COUNTRY WHERE DISTANCE OF SOCIAL ATOMS REDUCED FRICTION AND COLLISION BUT WITH THE GROWTH OF URBAN LIFE AND THE CONSEQUENT INTIMACY OF CONTACT BETWEEN PERSONS AND SOCIETIES MORE REGULATION BECOMES NECESSARY WE ARE DEFINING NEW CRIMES WITH EVERY LEGISLATURE AND SOON WE SHALL BRING IMMORAL AND WASTEFUL PHILANTHROPY UNDER LEGAL CONTROL SOME STATES HAVE ALREADY MADE PROGRESS IN THAT DIRECTION BEGINNING WITH THOSE ASSOCIATIONS WHICH RECEIVE SUBSIDIES IT IS TRUE THAT SUCH CONTROL IS OFTEN A MERE PRE TENCE AND AT THE BEST PUBLIC INSPECTION IS NOT INFALLIBLE EVEN WITH NATIONAL BANKS AND INTERSTATE COMMERCE BOARDS BUT THIS IS TRUE OF ADMINISTRATION GENERALLY IN AMERICAN CITIES AND COMMONWEALTHS AND THE REMEDY LIES IN IMPROVING THE SERVICE NOT IN INVITING ANARCHY TO REMAIN THE PERILS OF INSPECTION BY PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS IS ILLUS TRATED IN A RECENT ASSAULT UPON ONE OF THE BEST KNOWN REPRESENTA TIVES OF CHARITY ORGANIZATION BY AN IRRESPONSIBLE MONEY GATHERER WHOSE METHODS OF SPONGING ON BENEVOLENT PERSONS HAD BEEN EXPOSED AND THWARTED IN THE ABSENCE OF PUBLIC SUPERVISION OF ALLEGED PHI LANTHROPY PRIVATE FIRMS OF DETECTIVES HAVE DERIVED CONSIDERABLE INCOME FROM REPORTING TO BUSINESS MEN IN REGARD TO PERSONS AND ASSOCIATIONS WHO WISH TO BE FAMOUS FOR GOODNESS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE DEAR PUBLIC EVIDENTLY WHERE THE OWNER OF AN AUTOMOBILE MUST TAKE OUT A LICENSE BEFORE HE CAN USE THE STREETS FOR HIS PLEASURE SOME PROTECTION OUGHT TO BE GIVEN GENEROUS PEOPLE AGAINST THE LEGION OF WELLINTENTIONED SENTIMENTALISTS AND SHARP KNAVES WHO INFEST THE OFFICES AND HOMES OF BUSY PHILANTHROPISTS WITH PLEAS WHICH ARE PLAUS IBLE BUT WITHOUT FOUNDATION IN REASON IT IS PLAIN ENOUGH TO A STU DENT OF WORLD MOVEMENTS IN CHARITY THAT PRIVATE AGENCIES MAY BE SO CONDUCTED AS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF DEPENDENTS AND THROW HEAVIER BURDENS UPON TAXPAYERS AS THE HISTORY OF BEGGARS IN ITALY AND FRANCE CLEARLY PROVES NOT TO SPEAK OF INNUMERABLE FACTS IN OUR OWN CITIES THUS IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR CHURCHES TO SUPPORT A FAMILY OF DEPENDENTS UNTIL THEY HAVE REMAINED LONG ENOUGH TO ACQUIRE A LEGAL SETTLEMENT AND THEN CAST THEM UPON THE LOCAL GOVERN MENT TO CARE FOR BV OUTDOOR AND INDOOR METHODS PERHAPS THROUGHOUT GENERATIONS THE FIRST TO WELCOME STATE INSPECTION SHOULD BE THOSE GENEROUS BENEFACTORS WHOSE METHODS ARE SO WISE THAT PUBLICITY WOULD GIVE THEM DISTINCTION AND WHOSE GENEROSITY IS SO SPLENDID THAT ITS RECORD WOULD ADD LUSTRE TO STATE HISTORY BUT INSPECTION AND REGU 374 32WORLD CURRENTS IN CHARITY THEORY AND PRACTICE LATION BY THE INCOMPETENT APPOINTEES OF THE SPOILS SYSTEM WOULD NOT YIELD DESIRABLE RESULTS AND THE CIVIL SERVICE REFORM IS AS VITAL IN THIS CONNECTION AS IN RELATION TO MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT AND STATE INSTI

PERMA NENT RELIEF SOCIALISTS AND SPECIAL REFORMERS ARE PARTICULARLY IMPA TIENT WITH THE ENTIRE RANGE OF PHILANTHROPIC ACTIVITY BUT AT THE PRESENT HOUR THE DEMANDS OF DEMOCRATIC SENTIMENT AND OF THE LONG LOOK OF SCIENCE ARE HEARD AND HEEDED IN THE RANKS OF THOSE WHO COME NEAREST TO THE LOWEST STRATUM OF HUMAN MISERY INTELLIGENT VISITORS AMONG THE POOR ARE ALSO DISSATISFIED WITH ALLEVIATING MEASURES WHERE ANYTHING MORE SATISFACTORY IS POSSIBLE BUT UNDER ANY SYSTEM THE CALL FOR RELIEF WILL ALWAYS BE HEARD AND MAKE ITS APPEAL TO SOCIAL SYMPATHY THE INDEPENDENT AND SELFRESPECTING WORKINGMEN

CIVILIZATION ITSELF AND IS NOT A MERE CLASS CONTEST UNI VERSAL SUFFRAGE MEANS DEATH TO PROGRESS UNLESS THE GREAT MAJORITY OF MEN HAVE THAT TASTE FOR CULTURE WHICH COMES WITH A TASTE OF CULTURE IF THE PAUPER SPIRIT WERE NOT DETESTED BY THE MULTITUDE WE MIGHT EASILY RETURN TO A LAX ADMINISTRATION OF POOR LAWS SUCH AS BROUGHT ENGLAND TO THE VERGE OF BANKRUPTCY BEFORE THE REFORMS OF I834 SCIENTIFIC

VERY DESIRABLE TO INVESTIGATE AT CLOSE RANGE THE QUESTION HOW FAR AND IN WHAT WAYS VARIOUS METHODS OF POOR RELIEF AFFECT THE RATE OF WAGES IN CERTAIN INDUSTRIES THE BEST RESULTS CAN BE REACHED ONLY BY A WIDE AND PROLONGED INVESTIGATION BY THE PERMANENT CENSUS BUREAU OF THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT BUT PRIVATE STUDENTS MIGHT MAKE EXPERIMENTAL LOCAL STUDIES WHICH WOULD HELP FORMULATE THE WIDER INVESTIGATION OF THE GOVERNMENT AND TRAIN AGENTS FOR ITS SERVICE IN THE HISTORY OF POOR RELIEF THE INFLUENCE OF GRANTS IN AID OF WAGES HAS BEEN DISASTROUS IN THE EXTREME AND THERE ARE MANY 376 34WORLD CURRENTS IN CHARITY THEORY AND PRACTICE KINDS OF EVIDENCE IN THE RECORDS OF CITY AND STATE OFFICES WHICH REVEAL A SIMILAR TENDENCY EVEN IN AMERICA BUT WE HAVE NOT AS YET ADE QUATE STATISTICAL DATA FOR A JUDGMENT ALTHOUGH THE TEACHING OF HIS TORY COMPELS US TO LOOK FOR PRECISELY THE SAME RESULTS WHICH HAVE FOLLOWED LAX ADMINISTRATION IN SIMILAR SITUATIONS UNFORTUNATELY HISTORY DOES REPEAT ITSELF WHERE FORCES OF THE SAME KIND ARE WORKING ON THE SAME MATERIALS IT IS SPECIALLY IN CONNECTION WITH WHAT THE WEBBS CALL PARASITIC INDUSTRIES THAT WE MAY FIRST LOOK FOR SUCH EFFECTS OF WELLKNOWN CAUSES THERE ARE CERTAIN BRANCHES OF DEPARTMENT STORES OF A LOW GRADE AND SWEATED INDUSTRIES WHERE WE MAY FIND THE DISASTROUS INFLUENCE OF THE HABIT OF LIVING PARTLY ON WAGES AND PARTLY ON PUBLIC OR PRIVATE RELIEF LOCAL STUDIES HAVE ALREADY MADE FAIRLY CLEAR THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THIS SITUATION AND THE INCREASE OF PAUPERISM AN INVESTIGATION ON A LARGE SCALE IS REQUIRED TO ELIMINATE SPECIAL CAUSES AND OFFER A DEMONSTRATION WHICH WILL CONVINCE PRACTICAL MEN THE CONSUMERS LEAGUE IS URGING WITH A TRAGIC ARRAY OF CON CRETE ILLUSTRATIONS THE INFLUENCE OF THE EMPLOYMENT OF CHILDREN IN FACTORIES STREET OCCUPATIONS AND MERCANTILE ESTABLISHMENTS AT PRESENT THE BENEVOLENT PUBLIC TOLERATES THIS ROBBERY OF CHILD LIFE THIS SUPPRESSION OF PLAY AND EDUCATION THIS OBSTACLE TO PHYSICAL DEVELOP MENT AND SCHOOL TRAINING FOR THE PROFIT OF A FEW WHO DO NOT PRO POSE TO SUPPORT THOSE WHOSE VITALITY THEY HAVE DESPOILED BEFORE MATURITY WAS REACHED ADULTS THE NATURAL BREADWINNERS ARE DIS PLACED BY THEIR OWN OFFSPRING AND EVEN BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO EXPLOITING THEM AS SOURCES OF INCOME THIS IS GETTING SOMETHING FOR NOTHING AND IS PERMITTED ONLY BECAUSE THE PUBLIC HAVE NOT THE FACTS SPREAD BEFORE THEM IN THE BARE UGLINESS OF TRUTH THE ONLY INVESTIGATIONS WHICH IMPRESS THE MIND AND CONSCIENCE OF THE BUSY KINDHEARTED WORLD ARE LOCAL IN CHARACTER IMPORTED STATISTICS ARE LIKE CHARGED MINERAL WATER LEFT IN AN OPEN VESSEL FOR THE SPARKLE AND ZEST ARE VOLATILE FACTS LOSE THEIR MOMENTUM IF PROJECTED VERY FAR ACROSS STATE LINES THIS REMARK APPLIES TO THE BEARING OF DRINK HABITS ON PAUPERISM THE TEMPERANCE REFORMERS HAVE DULLED THE HEARING OF THE PEOPLE WITH THEIR SENSATIONAL DIN AND YET THEY HAVE WITH ALL THEIR EXAGGERATION BEEN UNABLE TO FIND ADEQUATE LANGUAGE TO EXPRESS THE FACT IT IS NOW DIFFICULT TO SECURE A HEARING ON THE SUBJECT FOR WE HAVE SUPPED FULL OF HORRORS LOCAL STUDIES CONDUCTED BY METHODS AS ACCURATE AS THOSE 377 35THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF WINES KOREN AND OTHERS FOR THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTY WOULD BE VERY IMPRESSIVE AND MIGHT SERVE TO PRICK THE JADED ATTENTION OF MANY COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY IF WITH AN ACCURATE DISPLAY OF THE CASUAL CONECTION BETWEEN DRINK AND TAX BURDENS THERE COULD BE PROPOSED MEASURES OF IMPROVEMENT WHICH ARE IMMEDIATELY PRAC TICABLE TO NUMEROUS GRADUATES OF OUR UNIVERSITIES WE MAY COMMEND ANOTHER FIELD FOR LOCAL STUDYFAMILIES AND TRIBES OF THE DEGENERATE STOCKS LIKE THE JUKES SMOKY PILGRIMS AND TRIBE OF ISHMAEL THE ARCHIVES OF SECLUDED COUNTRY ALMSHOUSES IN MANY PARTS OF THE LAND HAVE THE MATERIALS FOR STUDIES WHICH EVEN IF THEY DID NOT AT ONCE ADVANCE KNOWLEDGE IN GENERAL MIGHT SERVE IMPORTANT PRACTICAL AND LOCAL INTERESTS THE RECORDS OF INSTITUTIONS FOR THE FEEBLEMINDED HAVE NOT BEGUN TO YIELD UP ALL THEY MIGHT UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF TRAINED INVESTIGATORS AND IT IS ONLY AS ONE DEALS WITH PARTICULAR FACTS OF CONCRETE REALITY IN THE PHILOSOPHIC SPIRIT AND METHOD THAT HE COMES INTO A WORLD CURRENT OF LAW CHARLES RICHMOND HENDERSON

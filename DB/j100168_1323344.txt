j100168,Harvard Law Review,1323344,Reservations and Exceptions in a Deed,i256867,RESERVATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS IN A DEED The law in this country on the reservation of easements in deeds of land is much confused and still remains in doubt As the conveyances here are almost always by deeds poll and not by indenture the English doctrine of a grant back of the easement strictly would not apply Our courts have usually sur mounted this difficulty by calling the reservation an  exception appear ing to consider the grantors title as a bundle of rights and that one of these  the easement in question  was retained by the grantor An easement however has always been regarded by the common law as something newly created by the parties and entirely different from any of an owners rights over his property Accordingly a more consistent doctrine would be secured if instead of trying to bring the reservation of an easement under the head of an exception from the grant the courts recognized that the prevailing custom can only be supported on the ground of long usage The authorities on this subject are elaborately discussed in Smith et al v Furbish 44 Atl Rep 398 N H In i865 A the plaintiffs ancestor conveyed to B a tract of land along the bank of a river reservilng the right of building a dam across the river at any point and the right of flowage caused by the dam The defendant contended that as there were no words of limitation in the reservation A only reserved a life estate in the easement The court gave judgment for the plaintiff hold ing that these reservations must be construed as exceptions and hence words of limitation were unnecessary If the easement is to be construied as an exception there would seem to be no necessity for words of limitation  the grantor retaining part of his old estate it is in him of the old right unless the contrary appear in the deed The courts while appar ently agreeing with the principal case on this point are not unanimous as to what shall be called an exception Though the view of the principal case that ail reservations may be construed as exceptions in order to giveNOTES 405 effect to the intention of the parties appears to be prevailing yet the later Massaclhusetts cases hold that for the easement reserved to be con strued as an exception it must have been used by the grantor before the grant Clalin v Boston  Albany R R 157 Mass 489 Why such usage should affect the subject is difficult to comprehend The principal case would in Massachusetts tlherefore have to be supported on the theory of an imiiplied grant and there being no words of limitation the grantor would be held to have had only a life estate in the easement and the plaintiffs his heir would have accordingly failed

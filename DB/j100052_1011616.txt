Baker Voorhis  Co I9o9 In this little book Dr Alvarez has given an interesting historical resum6 of the various international law questions which have concerned the Ameri can continent He makes this study the basis for the formulation of the principles which have governed the states of America in their international relations and reaches the conclusion that the American hemisphere has certain factors peculiar to itself which have given rise to distinct views on questions of international law in other words that there is an American international law or certain principles which are recognized by the states of America in their dealings with one another In their relations with Europe the states of America have attempted to maintain certain of these principles This interesting thesis is treated in a scholarly manner The notes are full and instructive the arrangement and table of contents make up for the lack of an index American Railway Association Proceedings of the

xv 232 Price 75 cents New York Charles Scribners Sons I9Io In this volume the author has attempted to indicate the relation which should be maintained between Christianity and economic and social problems To prove his point he has covered almost the entire field of science beginning with the physical conditions of life among animals and men race differentia 223The Annals of the American Academy tions and the enforcement of civil authority continuing with a discussion of the functions of government the rewards of service and the chief fallacies in economic doctrines and concluding with a strong plea for the develop ment of Christian character through some form of secularized or applied Christianity In the course of such a broad survey it is inevitable that the author should misstate some of the modern scientific concepts To the stu dent of race problems for example his discussion of superior and inferior races clearly fails to express the modern view regarding race characteristics and policies So to the economist the statement of the Malthusian doctrines and of the principal fallacies underlying political economy in general is inter esting if not accurate The purpose of the book is good its moral is excel lent but in its execution the author has erred by seeking to include more than can normally be included within the scope of a single volume Davis W S The

Company of America I909 Eaves Lucile 4 History of California Labor Legislation Pp xiv 461 Berkeley Cal University Press I9Io The author of this volume has compressed into some 400 pages a record of the labor movement of California from its inception to the present time In a prefatory chapter for the purpose of giving an understanding of the social forces back of the labor legislation the history of the labor movement in San Francisco is traced Then the slavery question as incident to labor in Cali fornia is treated This is followed by a history of legislation relative to the regulation and later exclusion of the Chinese I852I906 the length of the work day the protection of wages the relation between employer and em ployee the labor of women and children the protection of the life and health of the worker Sunday laws employment agencies and the regulation of convict labor The work of the State Bureau of Statistics and the State Board of Arbitration is discussed and the part played by the union label the boycott and the injunction in unionism is also considered The author maintains that the chief objects of labor legislation in California have been the prevention of race associations objectionable to the working classes protection from cheap competition wholesome conditions and decent hours of labor security for payment of what is justly due and the right to promote the interests of the working classes Eliot C W The Future of TradeUnionism and Capitalism in a Democracy Pp v 128 Price ioo New York G P Putnams Sons 1910 This little book is composed of two lectures with the above titles delivered last year at Kenyon College by the former president of Harvard The book partakes of the nature of prophecy since it aims to show what changes must be made in both tradeunionism and capitalism before either is in complete harmony with the democratic ideal pictured by the author On the whole 224Book Departtment his arraignment of modern unionism suggests a viewpoint rather unsym pathetic to labor His remedy for the present unsatisfactory labor condi tions is academic in its adherence to the possibility of restoring competition as a regulator of many if not all industrial ills His program of restoring competition is to be furthered by a policy of publicity in all matters affecting either trade unions or manufacturers associations The duty of capital to resist the monopolistic features of tradesunionism assumes that tradesunion ism no longer needs to resort to strikes attacks on nonunion men boycotts and union labels in order to obtain fair wages reasonable hours of labor and the wholesomeness of the places where work is done Publicity will accom plish these and all other reasonable ends which tradeunions have proposed for themselves The treatment of the future of capitalism in a democracy suggests the reign of a benevolent despot When the capitalist class as a whole is strongly influenced by the desire to promote the real welfare and happiness of the workmen they employ they will invariably take thought for the means of providing their workmen with permanent homes which are not only whole some but cheerful and suitable for the bringing up of a family The lectures are interesting and the style easy though one feels in places that they lack the ring that comes with contact with men rather than books Everyday Ethics Pp 150 Price I25 New Haven Yale University Press I9I0 Everyday Ethics is a second collection of addresses delivered in the Page Lecture Course before the Sheffield Scientific School of Yale University It treats of certain problems of modern business life such as transportation speculation journalism accountancy law practice in their ethical aspects The ethics of today or rather the ethical values here presented are not however deduced from the usual a priori premises The authors are high grade experts intimately acquainted with the technique of modern industry rather than moralists They accordingly maintain that the moral principles in business are largely the logical natural and inevitable parts of the indus trial organism itself To do away with these practices the entire indus trial institution in question would have to be abolished The conception that industry is an organism does not lead necessarily to the justification of every kind of practice On the contrary it enables its advocates to separate the roses from the thorns and to suggest improvements which if in the line of organic continuation and development can be easily exe cuted and therefore of permanent value The addresses have been primarily intended for young business men yet the wide scope they cover and the particular information they contain make them of interest to a student of social psychology and ethics The value of the book is increased by a carefully prepared index Fess S D The History of Political Theory and Party Organization in the United States Pp 451 Price I50 Boston Ginn  Co 1910 Dr Fess has attempted to give us a work of which we stand in great need a study of the effect of political theory upon actual politics For the general 225lTh Annals of the American Acadetmy reader who has not studied civil government and whose United States history is confined to a high school course the book furnishes the sort of sup plement adapted to the small amount of time he can devote to the subject The earlier chapters are well written and deserve the attention of students whose interest is more thoroughgoing There is a good appreciation of Jef ferson and a better one of Hamilton though his monarchial tendencies are minimized The estimate of Marshall is the best chapter of the book After the early period the discussions are not so satisfactory due to an attempt to do too much in small space Political developments are traced chrono logically and at the same time an effort is made to give brief biographies of the chief characters and to bring together the thread of the theories they advocate Such a method necessitates many repetitions and crisscrossings which leave the reader confused Some of the subjects in spite of the manner of treatment are presented with tolerable clearness notably the breakdown of the legislative caucus and the rise of the convention In most cases the result is choppy The weakest point of the book especially if it is to be used as a text is the total lack of aids to further investigation A text is more a series of guide posts than the journeys end and the omission of all references to collateral reading and all citations even to the great cases which are landmarks in our constitutional history is decidedly disappointing In spite of these serious defects of omission and arrangement the book is a step in the right direction There is no great importance in a theory which is unre lated to practice and Dr Fess has done a service in emphasizing the extent to which the relation has existed in the history of the United States Frankel L K and Dawson M M Wiorkingmens Insurance in Europe Pp xviii 477 Price 250 New York Charities Publication Com mittee 191o Whether or not the uncertainties of life have increased with modern industry it is unquestionably true that there was never a time when more attention was paid to the elimination of industrial uncertainty than today In I9o8 the Russell Sage Foundation authorized the authors to investigate workingmens insurance in Europe and the results of this investigation have amply justi fied whatever appropriation was made for the purpose The authors have divided the problem into insurance against industrial accidents against sick ness and death against invalidity and old age and against unemployment This series of specific insurance problems is followed by a discussion of complete insurance systems In each case the general theory underlying the problem is stated and the most important European laws discussed It is made apparent first that the progressive countries of Europe have taken many important steps toward guaranteeing the certainty of the working life and second that unless some similar steps are taken the United States may look forward in the not far distant future to a serious curtailment of labor efficiency Frazer J G Totemism and Exogamy 4 vols Pp xxxiii 2i8I Price I6oo New York Macmillan Company I9Io 226Book Departmente Gephart W F Transportation and Industrial Development in the Middle West Pp 273 Price 2oo New York Longmans Green  Co go99 This volume is evidently the result of painstaking research The material presented is systematically arranged The authors style is easy and direct The purpose of the book is to correlate the development in transportation with the industrial development of Ohio The volume begins with an account of primitive routes of travel and trade and then considers in turn the settlement of the state early roads water transportation and industrial development down to 1830 The latter half of the book deals with the con struction of highways railroads and interurban railways with the improve ment of the Ohio and the construction of harbors on Lake Erie and with the industrial progress made by the state from 1830 to I900 The text is illustrated by several maps and diagrams There is a good bibliography at the end of the book In some instances the discussion has to do with a larger section of the country than the State of Ohio but that is the excep tion rather than the rule and it would have been more accurate to have used Ohio instead of The Middle West in the title of the volume The author correctly considers Ohio typical of the Middle West but it is hardly synonymous therewith Gompers S Labor in Europe and Amlerica Pp xi 287 Price 250 New York Harper  Brothers 19Io The American Federation of Labor sent its president Mr Samuel Gompers on a tour of inspection of European trade unions This book is an interest ing well written but somewhat superficial account of European conditions as seen by the author Throughout Mr Gompers reveals the typically self satisfied American IEuropean conditions are described at their worst while in contrast American conditions are painted at their best The book pur ports to show that the working man in America is infinitely better cared for than the working man in most of the countries of Europe While the state ment may be true it is certainly unjustified by the facts which Mr Gompers adduces in its support It is fair to describe this book as a pleasant narrative of travel bitterly antisocialistic in tone avowedly favoring the American trade union methods and conditions and written from a distinctly biased viewpoint Hill R T The Public Domain and Dem1ocracy Pp 240 Price 200 New York Longmans Green  Co I9go Jessup H H

exhaustive and gives a clear idea of what the law is at the present time The constitutional limi tations are well discussed and the various forms of legislative control are reviewed in detail The discussion of the effect of the Wilson act upon state legislation is especially well brought out and a review of the various methods of controlling the granting of licenses and of the rights acquired under them presents the latest legislative expedients which have been applied under the vague extra constitutional development called the police power Kelly E Twentieth Century Socialismt Pp xix 446 Price I75 New York Longmans Green  Co I9IO This volume left practically complete at the death of Mr Kelly and subse quently edited by Mrs Florence Kelley and the authors son Shaun Kelly is a discussion of the more elementary phases of socialism from the stand point of a late convert In Part I the author shows that socialism is not anarchism or com munism and that it will not suppress comnpetition destroy the home abolish property or impair liberty Part II is given over to a condemnation of capi talism the author contending that it is anarchistic wasteful and disorderly and the direct cause of overproduction unemployment prostitution labor troubles and adulteration The closing chapters of the book are devoted to an enumeration and discussion of the possible benefits to be derived from the existence of a socialistic regime The volume has all the earmarks of having been written by a person new to the subject unacquainted with its literature and ignorant of the finer more important points of its philosophy The only redeeming features of the book are the enthusiasm and sincerity of the author and the lucidity of his style Leupp F E The Indian and His Problems Pp xiv 369 Price 200 New York Charles Scribners Sons I91o A trained correspondent for twentyfive years in personal contact with the Indians for nearly five years commissioner of Indian affairs Mr Leupp was unusually qualified to tell Americans about the Indians The volume stands in a class quite by itself It is not a study in ethnology and its chief quality is the sympathetic appreciation of the Indians humanity It is the simple story of the Indian and his relation to the government and should be widely read The Indian is a man Treat him then as a man Do not pauperize him do not take away all incentive for effort Recognize that conditions vary from tribe to tribe man to man Extend a helping and protecting hand until it is clear that he can stand alone Then make him stand letting him learn by experience lifes lessons Even let him pay taxes and thus become as one of the rest of us There is little race prejudice towards the Indian so that amalgamation is sure to come The problem is therefore executive Private agencies should cooperate not spend most of their time in criticism Educate the children near their homes and in the things necessary to their future success 228Book Departmentet In most interesting fashion we are shown the various policies of the government and the difficulties encountered by the officials Altogether an unusual book to be highly commended Luffmann C B Quiet Days in Spain Pp xii 318 Price 200 New York E P Dutton  Co I9Io Unlike most books on Spain this is not written by a traveler or a sojourner of a few months M1r Luffmann has the unusual advantage of having lived not simply among but with the Spanish He knows their daily life their characteristic contradictions in character Few other writers have succeeded so well in portraying Spain of the present day There is no attempt to pic ture the past glories of the country in world affairs in learning or in art but a successful effort is made to portray the life seen in the third class railway coach the small towns and the wine plantations Most of the book describes the provinces of the southeast Among the points of usual interest to the tourist most emphasis is laid on Granada Seville and Leon The capitol and Cadiz are not touched and one can but feel that Barcelona in many respects the most interesting town of Spain from the human side is neglected McCrea R C

that the days of adventure are past and that there is lit tle left to discover Dr Mozaus narrative reaches vast regions still prac tically untouched by the white man and of almost inestimable possibili ties for future development The author is a globe trotter who felt that he had almost exhausted the pleasures of travel but found himself in a region full of varied experiences The narrative is easy and at times thrilling The style tends frequently to become profuse and the title especially for the first hundred pages has little reference to the subject matter One of the best characteristics of the book is the historical touch given in every chapter The author is familiar with many halfforgotten histories of the conquistadores which give his story the flavor of the original conquest Nogaro B and Moye M Les RgimZtes Donaniers Price 250 fr Paris Armand Colin Ostrogorski M Democracy and the Party System Pp viii 469 Price I75 New York Macmillan Company I91o Shortly after the appearance of lis work on Democracy aind the Organiza tion of Political Parties Mr Ostrogorski was requested to publish sep arately the portion treating of the United States This work is an abridg ment of that material with additions which bring the work down to date A new chapter is inserted showing the extent to which the legislative caucus still continued to be a factor in party government in America even when its nominating functions w ere taken over by the convention 229The Alnnals of the American Academy The style of the present work is to be commended In the condensation much of the repetition which marred the larger work is avoided It must be admitted however that the short chapters treating the development of legalization of parties especially the primary election laws are inadequate There are some curious estimates of present political movements The position assigned to Mr Hearst as a political prophet is extraordinary The proposals for reform are many of them unique but hardly practical In the senate associate senators are to work with those regularly elected and a nonpartisan system of elections to all offices is advocated Some of the suggestions are already a part of the political system in some of our states The short ballot the recall proportional representation preferential voting and the initiative and referendum receive commendation There is probably no better short account of the convention system but the later political developments receive inadequate treatment a fact which limits the availability of the work for use as a text Paltsits

study of Asia as it is presented in the usual textbooks of geography Like all carefully prepared books of this sort it is interesting reading even to one already familiar with the essential facts presented The journey all around Asia is as comprehensive as the title suggests though about half the space is devoted to China and Japan with Asiatic Russia and India de cidedly subordinated This division of space while open to criticism on some grounds is perhaps justifiable on the ground of greater immediate interest in China and Japan There is little reason for criticism of the material presented Much of it is hardly geography but the author frankly admits this fact at the outset His object apparently has been to present for young readers an interesting account of the essenitial things concerning Asiatic countries and their people In this he has succeeded fully as well as anyone else who has attempted a similar task in this field Richards Ellen H Euthenics Pp xii 162 Price

Price 75 cents New York John Lane Company I9o0 This is a little essay prompted by a socalled attack in The Times by Mr W H Mlallock on Mr Keir Hardie in which the former accuses the latter of ignorance of political economy The point at issue between the two lies in the right of the laboring class to share in the remarkable increase in the national income of England Mr Mallocks contention is that this increase has been produced by the exceptional ability of the employers and inventors and that therefore there is no reason to claim any share of it for the em ployee class Mr Shaw comes to the defense of Mr Keir Hardie at the same time attacking the position of Mr Mallock The author contends that the great advance in the worlds progress has been rather due to a class of persons inventors discoverers and the like who have proverbially died poor and that the stock dividends are going to a quite different class of persons He moreover contends that even were Mr Mallocks contention true it is a false social ideal to endeavor to guarantee to superior brains all the benefits that may flow from their efforts An author is granted a copyright for a limited number of years only Likewise the patent of the inventor is lim ited After a time their work is common propertypart of the social heritage of the race and contends Mr Shaw this is as it should be The book is forceful

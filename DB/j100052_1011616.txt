TRADEUNIONISM AND CAPITALISM BEFORE EITHER IS IN COMPLETE HARMONY WITH THE DEMOCRATIC IDEAL PICTURED BY THE AUTHOR ON THE WHOLE 224BOOK DEPARTTMENT HIS ARRAIGNMENT OF MODERN UNIONISM SUGGESTS A VIEWPOINT RATHER UNSYM PATHETIC TO LABOR HIS REMEDY FOR THE PRESENT UNSATISFACTORY LABOR CONDI TIONS IS ACADEMIC IN ITS ADHERENCE TO THE POSSIBILITY OF RESTORING COMPETITION AS A REGULATOR OF MANY IF NOT ALL INDUSTRIAL ILLS HIS PROGRAM OF RESTORING COMPETITION IS TO BE FURTHERED BY A POLICY OF PUBLICITY IN ALL MATTERS AFFECTING EITHER TRADE UNIONS OR MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATIONS THE DUTY OF CAPITAL

HAPPINESS OF THE WORKMEN THEY EMPLOY THEY WILL INVARIABLY TAKE THOUGHT FOR THE MEANS OF PROVIDING THEIR WORKMEN WITH PERMANENT HOMES WHICH ARE NOT ONLY WHOLE SOME BUT CHEERFUL AND SUITABLE FOR THE

TREATS OF CERTAIN PROBLEMS OF MODERN BUSINESS LIFE SUCH AS TRANSPORTATION SPECULATION JOURNALISM ACCOUNTANCY LAW PRACTICE IN THEIR ETHICAL ASPECTS THE ETHICS OF TODAY OR RATHER THE ETHICAL VALUES HERE PRESENTED ARE NOT HOWEVER DEDUCED FROM THE USUAL A PRIORI PREMISES THE AUTHORS ARE HIGH GRADE EXPERTS INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TECHNIQUE OF MODERN INDUSTRY RATHER THAN MORALISTS THEY ACCORDINGLY MAINTAIN THAT THE MORAL PRINCIPLES IN BUSINESS ARE LARGELY THE LOGICAL NATURAL AND INEVITABLE PARTS OF THE INDUS TRIAL ORGANISM ITSELF TO DO AWAY WITH THESE PRACTICES THE ENTIRE INDUS TRIAL INSTITUTION IN QUESTION WOULD HAVE TO BE ABOLISHED THE CONCEPTION THAT INDUSTRY IS AN ORGANISM DOES NOT LEAD NECESSARILY TO THE JUSTIFICATION OF EVERY KIND OF PRACTICE ON THE CONTRARY IT ENABLES ITS

SUBJECT THE EARLIER CHAPTERS ARE WELL WRITTEN AND DESERVE THE ATTENTION OF STUDENTS WHOSE INTEREST IS MORE THOROUGHGOING THERE IS A GOOD APPRECIATION OF JEF FERSON AND A BETTER ONE OF HAMILTON THOUGH HIS MONARCHIAL TENDENCIES ARE MINIMIZED THE ESTIMATE OF MARSHALL IS THE BEST CHAPTER OF THE BOOK AFTER THE EARLY PERIOD THE DISCUSSIONS ARE NOT SO SATISFACTORY DUE TO AN ATTEMPT TO DO TOO MUCH IN SMALL SPACE POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS ARE TRACED CHRONO LOGICALLY AND AT THE SAME TIME AN EFFORT IS MADE TO GIVE BRIEF BIOGRAPHIES OF THE CHIEF CHARACTERS AND TO BRING TOGETHER THE THREAD OF THE THEORIES THEY ADVOCATE SUCH A METHOD NECESSITATES MANY REPETITIONS AND CRISSCROSSINGS WHICH LEAVE THE READER CONFUSED SOME OF THE SUBJECTS IN SPITE OF THE MANNER OF TREATMENT ARE PRESENTED WITH TOLERABLE CLEARNESS NOTABLY THE BREAKDOWN OF THE LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS AND THE RISE OF THE CONVENTION IN MOST CASES THE RESULT IS CHOPPY THE WEAKEST POINT OF THE BOOK ESPECIALLY IF IT IS TO BE USED AS A TEXT IS THE TOTAL LACK OF AIDS TO FURTHER INVESTIGATION A TEXT IS MORE A SERIES OF GUIDE POSTS THAN THE JOURNEYS END AND THE OMISSION OF ALL REFERENCES TO COLLATERAL READING AND ALL CITATIONS EVEN TO THE GREAT CASES WHICH ARE LANDMARKS IN OUR CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY IS DECIDEDLY DISAPPOINTING IN SPITE OF THESE SERIOUS DEFECTS OF OMISSION AND ARRANGEMENT THE BOOK IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THERE

INTO INSURANCE AGAINST INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS AGAINST SICK NESS AND DEATH AGAINST INVALIDITY AND OLD AGE AND AGAINST UNEMPLOYMENT THIS SERIES OF SPECIFIC INSURANCE PROBLEMS IS FOLLOWED BY A DISCUSSION OF COMPLETE INSURANCE SYSTEMS IN EACH CASE THE GENERAL THEORY UNDERLYING THE PROBLEM IS STATED AND THE MOST IMPORTANT EUROPEAN LAWS DISCUSSED IT IS MADE APPARENT FIRST THAT THE PROGRESSIVE COUNTRIES OF EUROPE HAVE TAKEN MANY IMPORTANT STEPS TOWARD GUARANTEEING THE CERTAINTY OF THE WORKING LIFE AND SECOND THAT UNLESS SOME SIMILAR STEPS ARE TAKEN THE UNITED STATES MAY LOOK FORWARD IN THE NOT FAR

statute permitting each stockholder of a corporation to cumulate his votes upon any one or more candidates for directors is held by the Supreme Court of the United States in Looker v Maynard Advance Sheets U S 21 to be within the power reserved by the State Constitution to its legislature to alter amend or repeal future acts for incorporation and therefore not an impairment of the obligation of the contract between the State and the corporation LIFE INSURANCE FORFEITUREA State statute requiring notice of accrual of premium before forfeiture for nonpayment of a life insurance policy is held in Mutual Life Ins Co v Hill C C App 9th C 49 L R A 127 to be applicable and controlling notwithstanding statements of the assured that he cannot pay pre miums and that the company may consider the policy forfeited but this decision is reversed in 178 U S 347 44 L ed 1097 on the ground that both parties with knowledge of all the facts had agreed to abandon the contract SETOFFMERGERASSIGNEEOne who has recovered a judgment for dam ages on account of the breach of a contract and is afterward sued by an assignee of the other party who has become insolvent for the price of the goods covered by the contract is held in Bacon v Reich Mich 49 L R A 311 to be entitled to setoff against such assignee his original claim for damages as to which the assignee was in privity although he could not setoff the judgment against him because of a lack of privity The doctrine of merger is denied application to defeat this right JUDGMENTSDEATH OF DEFENDANT AFTER SERVICE BUT BEFORE JUDGMENT COLLATERAL ATTACKA judgment for money and for the foreclosure of a mortgage upon real estate against a deceased defendant who had theretofore been duly served with process is held in Kager v Vickery Kan 49 L R A 153 to be void although the fact of death does not appear upon the record and to be collaterally impeachable by heirs who were not parties to the foreclosure and who sue for the land With this case the great number of authorities on the effect of judgment entered against a dead person are collected and analyzed showing the conclusions at which the courts have arrived REAL ESTATE AGENTSIMPLIED AUTHORITY TO BIND VENDOR BY WRITTEN CONTRACTIn Rosenbaum v Beson 1900 2 Ch 267 it is held that where one gives another authority to sell real estate agreeing to pay a stipulated commission on the sale the agent has implied authority to bind his principal by a written con tract with the proposed purchaser The prevailing rule is otherwise in America Here the real estate agent when authorized merely to sell at a certain price is generally regarded as a mere broker to find a purchaser and bring the parties together without implied authority to close the contract of sale The reason is that a sale of real estate involves the adjustment of many matters outside of fixing the price Simmons v Kramer 88 Va 411 Kramer v Blair 88 Va 456 Halsey v Monteiro 92 Va6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER 581 Campbell v Galloway Ind 47 N E 818 Grant v Ede 85 Cal 418 20 Am St Rep 237 Stillman v Fitzgerald Minn 33 N W 564 Walker v Osgood 98 Mass 348 93 Am Dec 168 and note COMPUTATION OF TIME FROM OR AFTER A GIVEN EVENTA consti tutional provision that a statute shall not go into force  until ninety days after the adjournment of the session at which it is enacted is held in Halbert v San Saba Springs Land  L Asso Tex 49 L R A 193 to require the expiration of ninety full days after the adjournment before the act takes effect This case has a very extensive annotation on the rule as to first and last days in computation of time Time until a certain day within the meaning of an order of court is held in Conway v Smith Mercantile Co Wyo 49 L R A 201 to include or exclude the day mentioned according to the intention of the court which may be inferred from the subjectmatter and other considerations The day on which a bill is presented to the governor for his signature is held in State v Michel La 49 L R A 218 to be excluded in the computation of the five days allowed for a veto but the last day of the specified period is to be computed See Va Code sec 5 subsec 8 HAWKERS AND PEDDLERSLICENSE TAxIn Myers Case 92 Va 809 it was held that sec 32 of the Va Acts of 188990 p 197 requiring a license tax of peddlers was unconstitutional in so far as it affected nonresidents by reason of discrimination in the Act in favor of resident manufacturers The constitution ality of the Act so far as it affected resident peddlers was not before the court and therefore was not passed upon In State v Montgomery Me 47 Atl 165 the converse of the Virginia case was presented Here the statute discriminated against aliens not citizens of the United States This feature was held to deprive aliens the equal protection of the laws as guaranteed by the XIVth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States to any person within the jurisdiction of any State The defen dant was not an alien and was not therefore injured by the obnoxious provision yet the court held that this clause rendered the entire statute void that the statute being void as to aliens the latter were privileged to engage in the business of peddling without a license and that if a license might still be required of all per sons other than aliens the statute would operate as a discrimination in favor of aliens and against citizens contrary to the plain intention of the legislature and to the Constitution The unconstitutional portion of the statute was therefore held to be inseparable from the constitutional portion and the entire statute to be invalid The opinion of Savage J reviews at length the authorities on the subject of equal protection of laws under the XIVth Amendment SALES OF LIQUORSHIPMENTS C 0 DPLACE OF

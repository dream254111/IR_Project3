INSIST THAT THE TRIAL COURT MAY HAVE SET ASIDE THE VERDICT ON ONE OF SEVERAL GROUNDS EITHER OF WHICH WAS SUFFI CIENT TO JUSTIFY ITS ACTION ONE OF THESE GROUNDS IS THAT THE PLAINTIFFS 376 OCTACTION WAS BASED UPON AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN PARTNERS OR JOINT TENANTS AND THAT ONE PARTNER OR JOINT TENANT CANNOT SUE ANOTHER IN ASSUMPSIT WITH RESPECT TO CHATTELS HELD JOINTLY OR IN PARTNERSHIP THE CONTRACT SUED ON WAS NOT AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES AS PARTNERS OR JOINT TENANTS IT WAS A CONTRACT BETWEEN THEM AS INDI VIDUALS FOR THE PURCHASE OF PROPERTY TO BE DIVIDED EQUALLY BETWEEN THEM WHEN PURCHASED AND FOR ITS VIOLATION BY EITHER THE OTHER HAD THE RIGHT TO SUE AT LAW TO RECOVER DAMAGES FOR ITS BREACH WRIGHT V MICHIE 6 GRATT 354 VENNING V LECKIE 13 EAST 7 3 ROB PR NEW 151 3 MINORR INST 700 ANOTHER GROUND IS THAT THE WHOLESALE MARKET VALUE OF THE WHISKEY WAS NOT SHOWN IT IS TRUE THAT NO WITNESS TESTIFIED IN SO MANY WORDS WHAT ITS MARKET VALUE WAS BUT THE PLAINTIFFS EVIDENCE SHOWED THAT THE WHISKEY WAS WORTH OR HAD BEEN SELLING AT FROM 160 TO 250 PER GALLON THIS EVIDENCE WENT TO THE JURY WITHOUT OBJECTION ONE OF THE WITNESSES JAMISON STATES POSITIVELY THAT THE WHISKEY WAS WORTH ON THE DAY OF SALE 250 PER GALLON THE PRESUMPTION IS THAT HE WAS SPEAKING OF ITS MARKET VALUE SINCE IT WAS ALLOWED TO GO TO THE JURY WITHOUT OBJECTION IF THE DEFENDANT HAD ANY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT HE WAS NOT TESTIFYING AS TO ITS MARKET VALUE THE TIME TO RAISE THAT QUESTION WAS WHEN THE WITNESS TESTIFIED AND NOT AFTER VERDICT ANOTHER GROUND IS THAT THE VERDICT WAS EXCESSIVE AS BEFORE STATED THE PLAINTIFFS WITNESSES TESTIFIED THAT THE WHISKEY WAS WORTH FROM 160 TO 250 PER GALLON THE STATE SAVINGS BANK IT APPEARS HAD SOME TIME BEFORE PAID EIGHTY CENTS PER GALLON FOR A PART OF THE WHISKEY AND SOLD IT TO THE PLAINTIFF AT SIXTY CENTS PER GALLON EACH AGREEING TO PAY THE TAX 110 PER GALLON IN ADDITION MAKING THE WHISKEY COST INCLUDING THE TAX FROM 170 TO 190 PER GALLON THE VERDICT OF THE JURY SHOWS THAT IN ARRIVING AT THE DAMAGES FOUND THEY ESTIMATED THE VALUE OF THE WHISKEY AT NOT OVER 175 PER GALLON LESS THAN IT HAD PREVIOUSLY SOLD FOR AND LESS THAN WITNESSES TESTIFIED IT WAS WORTH ANOTHER GROUND RELIED ON IS THAT THE PLAINTIFF FAILED TO SHOW THAT HE HAD TENDERED PERFORMANCE OF THE CONTRACT ON HIS PART IF THIA WERE TRUE IT COULD AVAIL NOTHING FOR IT IS SETTLED LAW THAT WHERE A PARTY TO A CONTRACT ABSOLUTELY REPUDIATES IT AS THE DEFENDANT DID IN THIS CASE BY DENYING ITS EXISTENCE IT EXCUSES THE OTHER PARTY FROM MAKING ANY TENDER OF PERFORMANCE ON HIS PART LOWE V LARWOOD 139

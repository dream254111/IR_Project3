BARNES V MORRISON September 14 1899 1 CONTRACT TO PURCHASE AND DIVIDE CHATTELSRefusal to divideAction at law If two persons as individuals agree to purchase personal property jointly and divide it between them and the property is purchased by one of them who thereafter refuses to divide with the other the latter may sue the former at law to recover damages for the breach of contract 2 MARKET VALUE OF GooDsEvidence of valuePresumption after verdict In an action to recover the difference between the contract price and the market value of goods if witnesses are allowed to testify without objection as to the value of the goods it will be presumed that they meant the market value It is too late after verdict to raise the objection that the market value has not been shown 3 EXCESSIVE VERDICTA verdict is not excessive which is not only supported by evidence in the cause but is for a less sum than that fixed by some of the witnesses 4 CONTRACTSDenial of existenceTender of performance Waiver If a party to a contract absolutely repudiates it by denying its existence the other party is excused from making any tender of performance on his part 5 JUDICIAL AND GOVERNMENTAL SALESAgreements not to bid Where prop erty is to be sold at auction and especially at a judicial sale or at a sale in the course of governmental admistration a secret combination and agreement amongst persons interested in bidding to refrain from bidding in order to prevent competition and to lower the selling price of the property is illegal But it is not necessarily corrupt for two or more persons to agree that one of them shall purchase for their joint benefit property sold at a judicial or other public sale Whether such a combination is lawful or otherwise depends upon the intention of the parties and the effect of the arrangement as ascer tained from the evidence in each particular case Error to a judgment of the Hustings Court of the city of Roanoke rendered June 9 1898 in an action of trespass on the case wherein the plaintiff in error vas the plaintiff and the defendant in error was the defendant Reversed Watts Robertson  Robertson and John H Lewis for the plaintiff in error Hoge  Hoge for the defendant in error  Reported by M P Burks State Reporter 1899 373VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER BUCHANAN J delivered the opinion of the court Upon the first trial the jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiff which was set aside by the court on motion of the defendant On the second trial there was a verdict and judgment for the defendant To that judgment this writ of error was awarded By section 3484 of the Code as amended Acts 188990 p 360 Acts 18912 p 962 it is provided that where there have been two trials in the lower court the appellate court shall look first to the evidence and proceedings on the first trial and if it discovers that the court erred in setting aside the verdict on that trial it shall set aside and annul all subsequent proceedings and enter judgment on the first verdict The grounds upon which the court was asked to set aside that ver dict were that it was contrary to the law and the evidence and was excessive No objection appears to have been made nor exception taken to the introduction of evidence to the instructions given or to any rulings of the court during the progress of the trial The only question to be considered therefore is whether the case made entitled the plaintiff to the verdict found The action was brought to recover damages for the breach of an alleged contract entered into between the plaintiff and defendant by which it was agreed that the defendant should purchase for himself and the plaintiff jointly some five thousand gallons of whiskey which were being sold at public auction by a collecting officer of the United States Government to satisfy certain taxes and dues thereon By the terms of the contract as set out in the declaration it was agreed that the defendant should bid off for himself and the plaintiff the entire lot of whiskey which was to be divided equally between them either by the barrel or the gallon that the plaintiff should pay to the defendant one half of the purchase price which was to be applied to the pay ment of the taxes and dues for which the whiskey was sold The declaration avers that the defendant pursuant to the agreement did purchase the whiskey but afterwards refused to allow the plaintiff to have any part of it although he the plaintiff then and there and afterwards offered to pay the defendant his pro rata share of the pur chase price and to comply in every particular with the agreement on his part From the facts agreed it appears that there was due from Jamison  Prillman manufacturers of whiskey in the city of Roanoke the 374 OctBARNES V MORRISON sum of 3025 for taxes and deficiencies to the United States Govern ment for the payment of which one of its collecting officers adver tised and sold on the distillery premises about 4500 gallons of whiskey at 112 per gallon The plaintiff testified that he was the owner of about 500 gallons of the whiskey sixtythree barrels that he had purchased it from the State Savings Bank at the price of sixty cents per gallon the bank having previously purchased it at eighty cents per gallon each agree ing in his contract of purchase to pay the taxes thereon that at the time the collecting officer sold the whiskey he the plaintiff attended the sale to look after his interests when he arrived the sale was in progress and the whiskey was being cried at 111 per gallon that he spoke to the collector and asked him to hold up the sale that he was then introduced to the defendant who had made that bid and had a conversation with him in which he proposed that they jointly purchase the whiskey and that he the plaintiff be allowed to take the bar rels shown to have been originally purchased by him that the defend ant declined the proposition but agreed that he would buy all the whiskey for himself and the plaintiff jointly and that they would divide it barrel about that T F Jamison of the firm of Jamison  Prillman was present during the conversation and close enough to have heard it that the agreement between the defendant and himself was not made by either party to influence the bidding nor to prevent competition at the sale but only to enable the plaintiff to become the purchaser of the amount of whiskey that he had previously bought that they were jointly interested in the purchase but there was no agreement that they should not bid against each other On cross examination the plaintiff testified that he had gone to the sale for the purpose of protecting his interest and that if the defendant had re fused to make the agreement which they did make he would have bid on the whiskey as he had made arrangements to get money The plaintiff also testified that the defendant refused to deliver to him onehalf of the whiskey when he demanded it on the day it should have been delivered and introduced in evidence a letter from himself to the defendant in which he stated that he would be ready to take his half of the liquor recently bought as per their agreement at the warehouse and requested the defendant to let him know the day he would be in Roanoke to divide the whiskey and also the defendants reply in which he stated that he knew of no arrangement between 1899 375VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER them for the plaintiff to take onehalf of the liquor bought at Roan oke at cost The plaintiff further testified that he believed the whiskey was worth 250 per gallon on the day it ought to have been delivered November 1896 that he had offered it to Wheeling people in 1893 and 1894 at 200 per gallon The plaintiff then introduced as wit nesses the members of the firm of Jamison  Prillman the manufac turers of the whiskey who were present at the day of sale The for mer testified that he heard the agreement between the plaintiff and defendant which was that the latter should buy the whiskey for him self and the plaintiff each paying half of the purchase price and that it was worth on the day of sale 250 per gallon The other member of the firm testified that he knew the whiskey in question and that they had been selling it prior to the sale for taxes at from 160 to 250 per gallon that whiskey improved with age Another witness introduced by the plaintiff testified that he had been storekeeper of the United States at the distillery of Jamison  Prillman where the whiskey in controversy was stored that he had known it to sell for 250 per gallon and that whiskey improved with age The defendant to sustain his defence introduced himself and two other witnesses He testified that there was no contract between him self and the plaintiff for the purchase of the liquor that he purchased it for himself and had no arrangement with the plaintiff by which he was to become interested in it that he would not take another lot of liquor at the same price as it was not worth what he paid for it One of his witnesses testified that he bought of the defendant five barrels of the whiskey at 112 per gallon that he thought 130 per gallon was a good price for it on crossexamination he admitted that he was then selling a part of it by retail at sixtyfive cents per quart but it was not very salable The other witness who was the collecting officer testified that he made the sale in the discharge of his official duties that it was very common to make such sales and nothing unusual for persons attending them to unite and purchase jointly that from what he undersood from the defendant that day he was under the impression that he the de fendant was purchasing for himself and the plaintiff jointly The defendants counsel insist that the trial court may have set aside the verdict on one of several grounds either of which was suffi cient to justify its action One of these grounds is that the plaintiffs 376 Octaction was based upon an agreement between partners or joint tenants and that one partner or joint tenant cannot sue another in assumpsit with respect to chattels held jointly or in partnership The contract sued on was not an agreement between the parties as partners or joint tenants It was a contract between them as indi viduals for the purchase of property to be divided equally between them when purchased and for its violation by either the other had the right to sue at law to recover damages for its breach Wright v Michie 6 Gratt 354 Venning v Leckie 13 East 7 3 Rob Pr new 151 3 Minorr Inst 700 Another ground is that the wholesale market value of the whiskey was not shown It is true that no witness testified in so many words what its market value was but the plaintiffs evidence showed that the whiskey was worth or had been selling at from 160 to 250 per gallon This evidence went to the jury without objection One of the witnesses Jamison states positively that the whiskey was worth on the day of sale 250 per gallon The presumption is that he was speaking of its market value since it was allowed to go to the jury without objection If the defendant had any reason to believe that he was not testifying as to its market value the time to raise that question was when the witness testified and not after verdict Another ground is that the verdict was excessive As before stated the plaintiffs witnesses testified that the whiskey was worth from 160 to 250 per gallon The State Savings Bank it appears had some time before paid eighty cents per gallon for a part of the whiskey and sold it to the plaintiff at sixty cents per gallon each agreeing to pay the tax 110 per gallon in addition making the whiskey cost including the tax from 170 to 190 per gallon The verdict of the jury shows that in arriving at the damages found they estimated the value of the whiskey at not over 175 per gallon less than it had previously sold for and less than witnesses testified it was worth Another ground relied on is that the plaintiff failed to show that he had tendered performance of the contract on his part If thia were true it could avail nothing for it is settled law that where a party to a contract absolutely repudiates it as the defendant did in this case by denying its existence it excuses the other party from making any tender of performance on his part Lowe v larwood 139 Mass 133 Humpton v Speckenagle 9 S  R 212 11 Am Dec 704 The remaining ground relied on is that the agreement was illegal 1899 BARNES V MORRISON 377VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER and void because its purpose and necessary effect was to suppress bid ding or prevent fair competition when the whiskey was sold If such was the purpose or necessary effect of the agreement the court properly set aside the verdict for where property is to be sold at public auction and especially where the sale is made by order of a court or is made in course of governmental administration a secret combination and agreement among persons interested in bidding whereby they stipulate to refrain from bidding in order to prevent competition and to lower the selling price of the property is illegal according to the uniform decision in this country 2 Pom Eq Jur sec 934 Camp v Bruce 96 Va 521 But it is not necessarily cor rupt for two or more persons to agree that one of them shall purchase for their joint benefit property sold at a judicial or other public sale Whether such a combination is lawful or otherwise depends upon the intention of the parties and the effect of the arrangement This court held in Roudabush v Miller 32 Gratt 454 where two or more persons were desirious of acquiring different parcels of a tract of land offered for sale at auction by commissioners under a decree of court that it was not unlawful nor improper for them to bid for the whole tract with the understanding that they would divide it if they became purchasers with respect to the convenience and advantage of the situation of the several parcels to their own lands respectively In Phippen v Stickney 3 Metcalf 384 it was said by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts that an agreement between A and B that A will permit B to become the purchaser of certain property about to be offered for sale at public auction and that A shall partici pate with B in the benefits of the purchase will or will not be fraud ulent as the circumstances of the case show innocence of intention or a fraudulent purpose in making such agreement that where such ar rangement is made for the purpose and with the view of preventing fair competition and by reason of want of bidders to depress the price of the articles offered for sale below the fair market value it will be illegal and may be avoided as between the parties as a fraud upon the rights of the vendor but on the other hand if the arrangement is entered into for no such fraudulent purpose but for the mutual con venience of the parties as with the view of enabling them to become purchasers each being desirous of purchasing a part of the property offered for sale and not an entire lot or induced by any other rea sonable and honest purpose such an agreement will be valid and binding 378 OctBARNES V MORRISON In Wicker v Hoppock 6 Wall 94 the Supreme Court of the United States held that an agreement that one should procure judgment against the debtor levy upon and sell his property and that the other party to the agreement should bid the amount of the judgment for the property was valid under the facts of that case The validity of such agreement said Mr Justice Swayne in delivering the opinion of the court depends upon the intention by which the parties are animated and the object sought to be accomplished If the object be fairif there is no indirectionno purpose to prevent the competition of bidders and such is not the necessary effect of the arrangement in a way contrary to public policy the agreement is unobjectionable and will be sustained The Court of Appeals of New York in Baine v Drew 4 Denio 287 held that one whose property is about to be sold by virtue of a chattel mortgage may lawfully agree with another that the latter shall bid a certain amount for the property and if he becomes the purchaser shall give the mortgagor an undivided interest therein for the benefit of members of his family on his paying an equal share of the pur chase money In a later case Hopkins v Ensign 122 N Y 144 9 L R A 731 the same court held that an agreement between two or more persons that all but one shall refrain from bidding at a iudicial sale and that he shall be permitted to purchase the property is not neces sarily void but will be upheld if the intention of the parties is fair and honest and the primary purpose is not to suppress competition but to protect their own rights and there is no purpose to defraud or in jure others interested in the sale See also Kearney v Taylor 15 How 495 Mane v Garrison 83 N Y 14 28 Hunt v Elliott 80 Ind 245 41 Am Rep 794 Greenhood on Public Policy Rule C L XXVII p 190 Bigelow on Fraud 1423 3 Am  Eng Ency Law 5067 The plaintiff was the owner of or interested in about onehalf the whiskey which was offered for sale He testified that he attended the sale to look after his interests that the sale was in progress when lie arrived that the whiskey was being cried at 111 per gallon that at his request the collecting officer suspended the sale for a short time during which he was introduced to the defendant who had made the bid of 111 and had a conversation with him in which he proposed that they jointly purchase the whiskey and that he the plaintiff be allowed to take the barrels shown to have been bought by him that 1899 379VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER the defendant declined this proposition but agreed that he would buy all the whiskey for himself and the plaintiff jointly and that they would divide it barrel about that the agreement was not made to influence the bidding by either party nor to prevent competition at the sale but solely for the purpose of enabling the plaintiff to become the purchaser of the amount of liquor which he had previously bought that there was no agreement that he should not bid and that if he had not made the agreement he did with the defendant he would have bid on the whiskey as he had made arrangements to get money It further appears that Jamison one of the manufacturers of the whiskey for whose debt it was being sold was present during the en tire conversation between the plaintiff and the defendant and knew of the arrangement between them as did also the officer making the sale who testified that it was nothing unusual for persons attending such sales to unite and purchase jointly The jury at the request of and in a manner satisfactory to both parties were instructed by the court as to the law of the case upon this question as well as upon others The agreement was oral and made between the parties for a purpose which was legal or illegal ac cording to the intent with which it was entered into or the effect which it would necessarily have upon the bidding at the sale This was a question of fact for the jury Kearney v Taylor supra Hopkins v Ensign supra Phippen v Stickney supra They found in favor of its validity and it cannot be said that their verdict was plainly against the evidence or without evidence to support it They had the right to believe from the evidence that the plaintiff owned about onehalf of the property sold that his sole object in attending the sale and in making the agreement was to protect his own interest and to acquire the whiskey which he had theretofore purchased or an amount equal to it that there was no purpose to prevent competitive bidding at the sale and that such was not the necessary effect of the agreement We are of opinion therefore that the trial court erred in setting aside the verdict upon the first trial and that all subsequent proceed ings in the case must be set aside and annulled and judgment entered upon that verdict Reversed Oct 380

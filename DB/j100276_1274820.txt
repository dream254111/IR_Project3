case is limited in its effect to removing from the application of the general rule those holding companies organized primarily to evade the law CORPORATIONSISSUE OF STOCK FOR PATENTS UNDER MICHIGAN STATUTES The corporation was capitalized at 2000oo of which iooooo was sub scribed and 20200 paid in cash and property Also a contract was entered into by which 70000 in stock was issued to A B  C in return for their promise to assign the American patent when it should be issued to an air compressor for automobiles Later when it was found impossible to obtain an American patent the directors of the corporation voted to accept the foreign patents already held by A B  C in lieu of the American patent Held that this contract was in fraud of the other stockholders and that the stock issued to A B  C should be delivered up to be canceled and they barred from sharing in distribution of corporate assets on dissolution In re American Air Compressor Co Mich I916 I60 N W 388 Clause 6 of 2 of the General Incorporation Laws of Michigan How ANN STAT 9533 provides that IO of the authorized capital stock of a corporation must be paid in cash or property and in the latter case there must be affidavits by at least three of the incorporators averring actual trans fer to the corporation and swearing to the actual value Here it seems that 70000 in stock was to be issued on the mere possibility of a patent and it is difficult to conceive how a patent right in futuro could have been trans ferred to the corporation or how it could have satisfied the further require ment of the statute that it be transferable by the corporation and subject to levy and execution by the corporate creditors The matter was not brought up in the case and was not mentioned in the opinion as it was not necessary to decide the case This is regrettable In many corporations a large amount of stock is issued for patent rights The Michigan statute is in terms most rigid The evaluation of a patent right which must be sworn to is a diffi cult matter at best and it is of the greatest importance to a large number of honest and wellintentioned citizens that the courts define just what is re quired of incorporators who wish to issue shares for patent rights which are necessarily more or less conjectural in value EVIDENCEEXPERT TESTIMONY NOT ADMISSIBLE ON QUESTION OF SIGNA TURE BY MARKA will was signed by a feeble man 92 years of age who made a mark as a substitute for his signature Three witnesses testified that the testator had made the mark two testifying that the testator had made the mark unassisted while the third testified that he had aided the testators feeble hand in making the mark Plaintiffs contesting the will offered ex pert testimony to show that this was not the mark of the testator Held that the court properly excluded the testimony as a mark is not writing within the meaning of New York Laws I880 Ch 36 and Laws I888 Ch 555 which permit the comparison of writing by experts In re Caffreys Will 1916 I6I N Y Supp 277 The court decided this case upon the authority of In re Hopkins 172 N Y 360 65 N E 173 65 L R A 95 92 Am St Rep 746 where it was exMICHIGAN LAW REVIEW pressly held that a mark was not writing within the meaning of the above statutes A close examination of those statutes shows that they only extend the field of expert testimony and do not declare what constitutes writing so that the court would have decided that a mark is not writing subject to comparison by experts without the existence of the statute The cases hold ing with the instant case go on the theory that these disputed marks have no prevailing characteristic which would enable an expert to speak with any degree of certainty as to the identity of the person who made them hence a comparison is improper Some of the cases holding to the above theory are Jackson ex dem Van Dusen v Van Dusen 5 Johns 144 4 Am Dec 330 Jackson v Jackson 39 N Y I53 Shinkle v Crock 17 Pa St I59 An other line of cases go upon the theory that since the jury must compare the mark to see if it is genuine the comparison should be made more intelligible by comparisons made by experts They hold that such comparison is pos sible for marks made by hands trembling with old age or by illiterate per sons have characteristics of their own differing from those made by steady hands and with intelligent design State v Tice 30 Ore 457 48 Pac 367 On the question of comparison of crossmarks there is also a division of opinion Travers v Snyder 38 Ill App 379 holds that crossmarks can not be distinguished so as to produce dependable evidence unless by some strong proof it is shown that the signers mark had some peculiar distinguishing characteristic See also State v Byrd 93 N C 624 The case of Shank v Butsch 28 Ind 19 strongly intimates that crossmarks are writing and sub ject to the same rule as other signatures EVIDENCEUNAUTHENTICATED BOOKS OF ENTRYPlaintiff claims on con tracts for sawing lumber for the defendant Carruth an employee of plaintiff kept account of the work done on tally boards at the mill from which as well as from oral reports of Carruth plaintiff made up the book admitted in evidence Carruth was out of the state and was not produced to authenti cate these figures nor was any attempt made to obtain his deposition on this ground defendant objected to the admission of the book Held this book was properly admitted on grounds of convenience and necessity and that such admission must be left to the discretion of the trial court Squires v OConnell Vt 1916 99 Atl 268 The court justified the entry of the book without authentication on grounds of practical convenience Formerly when employers engaged in small in dustries had only a few employees strict rules of authentication may have been quite practicable but nowadays large concerns employ thousands of men many of whom are obliged to make individual reports from which the books must finally be made up and the strict rule would work severe in convenience The courts are facing this practical difficulty and are as above leaving it to the discretion of the trial court to determine when such au thentication may be dispensed with The reliability of the present systems of bookkeeping as opposed to the old slipshod methods seems to be another reason for relaxing the rigid rules of authentication 2 WIGMORE

Inspector Louisiana It seems incredible that in this age it should be necessary for men and women to leave their homes and private businesses to come together to devise ways and means to awaken the consciences of other men and women and make them feel their responsibility to wards little children George Eliot conveys the idea somewhere in her writings if one is sitting in a room and sees a piece of bricabrac about to fall instinctively the hand is put forth to try to catch it And it does seem that every one would put forth a hand to save the little ones but that this is not done is evidenced by the gathering of these men and women in Atlanta today to try to solve this vexing disheartening problem The most potent reason in my opinion why the children are in the factory is our school system Our present method of instruc tion particularly for the boys between eight and twelve does not interest the children This is due to two causes the overcrowded condition of the school rooms especially in the middle grades which makes it impossible for the teacher to give personal attention to the less intelligent children and the alarming number of our children who are defective in sight hearing or what is even more prevalent and distressing the debilitating effects of the adenoid growth which saps the vitality and acquiring power to an incredible degree These defective children soon fall behind in their studiesthe teacher has not the time to give them any personal attention or en couragement They become discouraged and wish to leave school The teacher sees the standard of her years work greatly lowered through these socalled stupid children and she encourages the little ones to leave You must not blame the teacher rather blame the niggardly appropriations and the lack of a true appreciation of the great value of education as demonstrated by our Southern law makers on this question of education 67The Annals of the Am1erican Academy Demand for Education Tell me the South is too poor to educate her children and I tell you we are too poor not to educate them If we are poor it is because we have been ignorattignorant of the value of our great forests and streams our mines and franchises which we sold to Northern capital The South must have compulsory industrial edu cation and have it nownot ten years hence when the boy and girl of today have gotten away from us If need be stop every other improvement such as paving and building magnificent court and jail houses You do not need fine school buildings Some of the finest men and women this country has ever known were edu cated in logcabins Above all you want the teacher who has been taught how to teach who feels her responsibility towards the piece of putty placed in her hands It is the teacher who will make this America of ours what it should be not the business man nor the politician In Wyoming one of the states where women are just as good as men on election day the state has said there shall be no such thing as ignoranceit is too costly therefore if there is one child on a mountain top too far from the district school to attend regularly a teacher is sent to live in the home of that child for ten months and is paid for the entire twelve months The state recognizes the right of the child to an education and of the teacher to a living wage In the South we expect a woman to go into a state of coma two or three months of each year as we pay only for the months she actually works And here let me sound my note of warning to those of us who fear that under compulsory education laws the negro child will be educated As far as my experience goes I have yet to find a Jew or a negro child in a mill factory or department store They are at school well nourished playing out in our glorious Southern sunlight waxing strong and fat it is only your whitefaced sunkenchested curvedbacked little Christians who are in the mills and department stores The public school system must become an adjunct to the homeit must help the busy housewife who no longer has a yard for her children to play in but must turn them into the streets while she fulfils the many duties of the position she holds as wife 68Why the Children are in the Factory mother housemaid cook laundress seamstress nurse This busy woman tas a hard time keeping up with the boy or girl of ten or twelve who filled with the spirit natural to childhood wants to be doing something The average mother fears the influences of the street and so consents to the childs entering the factory thinking he is safer within its four walls Never was there a greater mistake for all the objections which can be urged against the street bad companionship dust bad language and diseaseprevail in the factory with the added nervous strain of the work and the constant standing from ten to twelve hours each day Therefore our schools must arrange for the defective child the backward child and the saddest of all children the child of parents who have not yet learned the value of education By diversified work directed play and proper supervision the school must help the mother raise her child If the churches of this country really wish to be a vivifying dynamic force in our daily life they must awaken to the fact that they have not taken their share in the great humanitarian movements of the day These have grown up outside the church The min isters and church men and women must make their religion work they cannot afford to keep it as they do their best clothes only to be used on Sunday The mill woman who knows she is overworked and underpaid is not apt to feel kindly towards a religion which preaches justice and equality for all when she sees the men and women who fatten off her days labors exalted to the high places Parental Responsibility Another reason why the children are at work is the independ ence which comes especially to the boy from the possession of what seems to them a great deal of money and also the freedom from home surveillance I put one boy of nine years out of a department store whose mother told me he left home at 630 a m on a breakfast of coffee and bread taking with him a half loaf of bread for his lunch and a nickel with which he bought a cup of coffee at a barroom As he lived too far from the nightschool to return home for dinner he played with other boys similarly situated until eight oclock when they went to school reaching home at ten oclock Think of a child away from home nearly sixteen hours a dayaway from all home influence all parental control We do much talking about home influence but we do very little work towards securing it 69The Annals of the American Academy 70 The boys also use the excuse of going to nightschool as a cover to their prowling around the haunts of vice and sin in our large cities Nightschools for children under sixteen years of age should be forbidden by law I have no patience with any system of economics or civilization or Christianity which permits to exist a condition which deprives a boy or girl of the inalienable right of an American subject the right to a free daylight education I There is no more pitiful sight than a lot of tired little brains and bodies bending over spelling books and sums when they should be in bed The United States Supreme Court has just decided by unani mous vote that the states have the right to legislate in favor of women and children as to their working hours because woman is the race and without strong capable mothers the race becomes decadent What chance for proper motherhood has the girl of four teen who starts working in a factory knowing nothing of the duties of homemaking The knowledge of cooking and housekeeping and the care of children do not drop down upon a woman by intui tion on her wedding day and there is many a heartburn as well as burnt beafsteak and soggy potato while she learns these essen tials which should have been part of her public school education Ignorant parents knowing nothing of the value of educa tion constitute another strong factor in accounting for the children who are in the mills They see only that silver dollar which Dr Adler said we have all gazed at so long and steadily that it has hypnotized us They do not appreciate the evil effects upon the child Out of five hundred homes visited last summer in only five did I find it necessary or wise to pay the wage of which I had de prived the family by putting the child out of the factory Back of nearly every child at work is a lazy shiftless father or an incompe tent mother The Demand for Cheap Labor Of course the desire of the manufacturer for cheap labor is a great incentive to the employment of children Despite their oft repeated statement that child labor is unprofitable they continue to dragnet every city town and hillside for workers I have never been able to decide why they turn their mills into eleemosynary insti tutions unless it be the same spirit which makes them insist that the healthiest occupation in the world for a young child is work inWhy the Children are in the Factory a cotton mill I have been tempted after listening to the great advantages of a dustladen noisy tentotwelvehour workday to put a sign on our mills saying Come all ye weary mothers bring your fretful restless babies here is a restful quiet clean sweet atmosphere and plenty of sunshine with which we promise to cure any and all ills  I know it will surprise many to learn that the installment system is a large factor in the early employment of children In gathering this item of knowledge the value of the woman as an inspector was impressed upon me for the woman factory inspector notices the household furnishings and can go into the kitchen or washshed if need be Many a child is working to pay the weekly installment of 250 on the piano or the fifty cents on the green plush album or the matting with big pink roses splashed all over it No one approves more than I of sweet attractive homes and the refining influences of music but it is paying a heavy price for these little elegancies when the future of a child is weighed against the possession of a green album The whole principle of child labor is such an extravagant one I marvel that the great practical American people have permitted it to continue from a purely com mercial standpoint It is certainly a poor business policy which per mits a firm or corporation to get seven or eight years work out of a child and then turn him out upon the community to be cared for at public expense through long years of invalidism or criminality As long as we sit passively content with present conditions our civilization will remain a travesty our muchvaunted prosperity a rebuke and our Christianity a mockery 71

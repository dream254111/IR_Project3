farmers in Minnesota have been under observation in order to secure accurate data in regard to farm finance Bulletins 48 and 73 published in 1906 and 1909 respectively relate to the same general investigation From eight to ten farms were selected in each community and in co6peration with each group a special agent was stationed to supervise the collection of the data It was the duty of this agent to visit each farm daily obtain a complete report as to the number of hours of man and horse labor spent on every operation and the amount of sales and expenditures A part of three days out of every month was spent by the agent on each farm during which period grain and other food was weighed and the milk of each dairy was tested and weighed From such records the annual cost of maintenance of a cow allowing for depreciation and interest is given by years for the three communities Northfield  1905 5442 1909 6282 Marshall  1906 4046 1909 4786 Halstead  1904 4221 1909 5891 In each

COMMISSION In its recent re port to the President the Railroad Securities Commission Washing ton 1911 pp 44 has accomplished an admirable piece of work The document is concise even crisp in statement cogent in reasoning with the exceptions noted below wise in general conclusions and con ciliatory in spirit It should materially assist in the promotion of those good relations between the government and the railroads now happily in a fair way to become established No one can question the wisdom of the emphasis laid upon full publicity as the foremost need of the time Whether it is enough by itself to prevent a recurrence of past abuses may indeed be doubted The publicity features of the acts of 1906 and 1910 are certainly bound to be far reaching in their effects upon operation They should with equal certainty as is here proposed be extended to cover both promotion and subsequent financ ing Not less important and wise than the insistance upon financial pub licity is the recommendation that until the Supreme Court has clearly defined the relations between federal and state authority the federal government shall refrain from attempting to regulate the issue of securities Too many difficult legal complications remain to be cleared up One might perhaps have wished for a somewhat more enthusiastic commendation of the efforts of states like Massachusetts and New York to cope with their local problems of financial control The ap parent absence of a due appreciation of the importance of the work of the various public service commissions all over the country may perhaps be accounted for on the ground that it lies outside the scope of the work of a purely federal commission Yet a word of encourage ment to these state administrations would have done something to off set the rather negative character of its conclusions Someone must exercise financial control If inadvisable for the federal government to undertake it at this time as may well be then it is important to emphasize the fact that the states must do it as best they can On the other hand the recommendations concerning physical valuation as an element in rate regulation are sufficiently progressive to impart182 Documentts and Reports Mar an aspect of judicial balance and general fairness which inspires confidence Two specific conclusions of the commission however seem still open to debate One is the contention that little relation obtains between capitalization and rates The statement is of course largely true but like most generalizations of the sort fails to state the whole truth It is probably absolutely true as to particular rates No one would claim for a moment that the heavily capitalized Wabash operating in Trunk Line territory alongside the Pennsylvania system could charge any higher rates because of its financial disabilities Rather the reverse But while true of particular rates capitalization does exert an indirect but nevertheless a very appreciable influence upon the general level of rates For this point I have argued elsewhere at some length Is it surprising that the pressure for advanced rates in 19101911 in Trunk Line territory should come from the heavily capitalized New York Central with substantial aid and comfort from the Erie Was it a mere coincidence that the Lackawanna road with its securities quoted above 500 was a less prominent factor in the agitation than some of its neighbors True enough no direct relation between rates and capitalization exists but that a positive incentive to higher charges in general may be found in the need of support ing a large capitalization seems reasonably clear in the light of ex perience It seems to me that this has been unduly minimized in the report A most debatable and as I hold it dangerous proposition in this report is the proposed abolition of the dollar mark upon capital stock However desirable it may be for mining companies and the lesser in dustrials as in Germany to do away with any stated par value for share capital in order to disabuse the public mind of its purely arti ficial character the proposition is quite different when applied to an industry like a railroad There is all the difference in fact between purely private and competitive conditions of a more or less speculative character and those under which monopoly privileges are conferred by gift of the public Space does not permit a criticism of this propo sition in detail I have elsewhere discussed it more at length2 Many objections occur at once none of them mentioned in this report which almost jauntily as it seems proposes to revolutionize all of our customary habits of financial thought Among these objections there I Political Science Quarterly XXII 1907 p 600 2RailwayAge Gazette November 24 1911 p 10641912 Corporations 183 is the fact that abolition of par value removes the restraint upon the promoter or management for liability to creditors in case of part paid shares The experience of the Asphalt Company of America is illumi nating in this regard May we trust mere publicity to provide cor responding safeguards for honest promotion with this liability re moved Then again how about the issue of stock in exchange for property acquired as has frequently occurred in the course of recent railway consolidation Is it immaterial whether the absorbing com pany has put out 500000 participating shares with a market value of 100 each or twice that number of certificates of participation commanding half that figure per unit in exchange for the property acquired And still further there is the inevitable effect upon specu lation One of the primary needs today is to separate our common carriers from Wall Street influence Does it make no difference whether the Southern Railway participating shares are traded in around 25 or those of the Louisville and Nashville command a price of 150 Low quotations offer a great stimulus to speculative manipu lationas any student of Rock Island affairs must concede To do away with par which means permission to emit without reproach at any figure below parhow hard it is indeed to get rid of that con ception of some standard of normalitycannot but exert a malign influence And then finally there is over and above all other consider ations the need of some general standard of comparison for all sorts of purposessome base from which to judge of normality To wipe out all such standards with the mere warning to public and investors alike to beware seems like a step backward This brings us to the insistence of the commission upon the present need of the railroads for more capital for development and the diffi culty of financing new enterprises under regulative provisions of law such as the prohibition of the issue of shares at a discount Massa chusetts has recently passed through an experience of probably ex cessive regulation But simple modifications of its antistockwater ing laws seem to have solved the difficulty Of course the develop mental problems of the West and South are quite different from those of New England Yet there is the experience of Texas to fall back upon Complaint is made of course especially by the Gould roads of the insufficiency of capital for new work But the growth of mileage seems nevertheless to compare not unfavorably with pro gress in other states Are the Gould roads for example any better off in other states where greater liberality of laws prevail The184 Documents and Reports Mar fact is that much new construction and improvement remains to be done all over the country as this report duly emphasizes but much of it is to be done by companies already in the field Not many new steam railroad companies are now needed even in the West Let them learn the lesson so often forgotten that honest management and conservative financing to the end that solid credit be first estab lished has far more to do with facilitating development than non interference by law This is probably a time when encouragement to the railroads in a period of stress should properly be given But let us not forget that good faith to the public and to stockholders to gether with prudent financing must be the primary source of credit Many admirable features of this report deserve mention did space permit The clear exposition of the distinction between stocks and bonds and especially the discussion of intercorporate financing oc cupy a prominent place The document is likely to play a large part in the determination of governmental policy in future It well merits the most careful perusal by legislators financiers and econo mists WILLIAM Z RIPLEY The Annual Report of the Attorney General of the United States for 1911 Washington Department of Justice pp

New York joins with Mr Peters in making the report Labor WASHINGTON WORKMENS COMPENSATION ACT CONSTITUTIONAL On September 27 1911 the workmens compensation act of the state of Washington was upheld by the supreme court of that state The law was enacted March 14 1911 to go into effect on October 1 of the same year The constitutional points of the law were therefore decided before its provisions had been put into effect The state auditor be lieved the law unconstitutional and therefore refused to issue an order upon the state treasurer for the expenditure of funds that had been provided for establishing the proposed compenstition system Man damus proceedings followed the law passed immediately to the courts and received the speedy determination stated above The law is the most drastic of its kind enacted in the United States It provides that workmen injured in extra hazardous labor shall re ceive fixed and certain compensation regardless of questions of fault and to the exclusion of every other remedy proceeding or compen sation except as otherwise provided in the act If injury results in death compensation goes to the workmans family or dependents The socalled extra hazardous employments according to the lan guage of the act include factories mills and workshops where ma chinery is used printing electrotyping photograving and stereotyping plants where machinery is used foundries blast furnaces mines wells gas works water works reduction works breweries elevators wharves docks dredges smelters powder works laundries operated by power quarries engineering works logging lumbering and shipbuilding operations logging street and interurban railroads buildings being constructed repaired moved or demolished telegraph telephone188 Documents and Reports Mar electric light or power plants or lines steamheating or power plants steamboats tugs ferries and railroads Also every other industry shall be included although not enumerated in this list if it should prove in experience to be extra hazardous Employers in such indus tries are compelled to make contributions to an insurance fund in pro portion to the accident hazard of their respective business but other employers may elect to come under the law The fund is ad ministered by the state and is used for paying such claims as properly arise under the act While the Washington statute is more drastic than that of New York which was declared invalid by the Court of Appeals on March 24 1911 the two involve the same constitutional points How ever the Washington court passing upon these points held dia metrically opposite views from those of the New York court The latter maintained that when an employer has exercised reasonable care and when he has obeyed the direct laws requiring safety devices sanitary arrangement etc he has fulfilled all the duties that can be imposed upon him To go beyond this with legislation would be to create liability without fault which cannot be done under our con stitutionsnot even under the police power i e the power of the state to regulate industry in behalf of the public welfare Opposed to this view the Washington court holds that if circumstances warrant liability without fault may be created it cites numerous cases in which this has been done and has been supported by the courts The test of a states power to regulate industry to quote from the opinion of the court is found in the effect the pursuit of the calling has upon the public weal rather than in the inherent nature of the call ing itself As to the act in question the court holds that if it has a reasonable relation to the protection of the public health morals safety or welfare it is not to be set aside because it may incidentally deprive some person of his property without fault or take the property of one person to pay the obligations of another To be fatally de fective in these respects the regulation must be utterly unreasonable and so extravagant in nature and purpose as to capriciously interfere with and destroy private rights The court believes that it is not un reasonable to hold employers responsible for remote and the more serious consequences following the use of their property and there fore allowed the law to stand Since compensation laws are as much a matter of the federal as of the state constitutions the Washington decision should be prompt1912 Labor 189 ly passed for review to the Supreme Court of the United States In view of the present liberal personnel of that court and further in view of its recent decision in the Noble State Bank vs Haskell 219 U S 104 the Washington decision would probably be upheld If so while it would not be binding upon the individual state jurisdic tions nevertheless it would set a high standard of opinion which would probably be followed by the state courts Then the legislatures would be quite free to pass any desirable compensation act without constantly confronting the constitutional bugaboo JOHN BAUER

Wisconsin income tax which was briefly described in the last number of the REVIEW p 906 has recently been affirmed by the supreme court of Wisconsin in the cases of State of Wiscon sin ex rel Harry W Bolens v James A Frear Secretary of State et al and Arthur Winding et al v James A Frear et al Considerably more than half of the opinion upon these cases is occupied by a discussion of the original jurisdiction of the supreme court of Wisconsin a subject which need not be reviewed here With respect to the essential constitutional questions raised by the income tax itself the court decided only those major contentions which might from some point of view be considered as going to the validity of the whole act In the following statement of the affirmative ac tion of the court it should be remembered that the law rests upon a constitutional enactment which provides that The rule of taxation shall be uniform and taxes shall be levied upon such property as the legislature shall prescribe Taxes may also be imposed on in comes privileges and occupations which taxes may be graduated and progressive and reasonable exemptions may be provided 1 Probably the most fundamental criticism of the law was based upon the contention that its progressive features were unreasonably discriminative and that it led to double taxation both of whichit was asserteddenied to citizens the equal protection of the laws and hence violated the fourteenth amendment to the federal consti tution These arguments the court held to be unsound not even to be very persuasive Double taxation at least that kind of double taxation which arises from the contemporaneous operation of income and property taxes is specifically authorized by the Wisconsin con stitution and as appears from the decision in M C R R Co vs Powers 201 U S 245 is not repugnant to the federal constitution1912 Public Finnce 195 With regard to the progressive feature it is aptly said under Knowlton vs Moore 178 U S 41 on page 109 by the present chief justice that taxes imposed with reference to the ability of the person upon whom the burden is placed to bear the same have been levied from the foundation of the government So also some authori tative thinkers and a number of economic writers contend that a progressive tax is more just and equal than a proportional one In the absence of constitutional limitation the question whether it is or is not is legislative not judicial  2 Assessors of incomes under the Wisconsin law are appointed by and remain under the complete control of the state tax commission One of the contentions upon which the opponents of the tax laid great stress was the claim that the law violates the constitutional guaran tees of local selfgovernment by placing the power of appointment of the various assessors of income3 in the state tax commission The courts answer to this claim apparently furnishes conclusive evidence that the Wisconsin courts will not unnecessarily stand in the way of reasonable measures looking to the correction of the excessive de centralization of our taxing machinery 3 The court next considering a number of questionis raised by the exemption features of the income tax law held that a the personal exemptions were not only essentially reasonable but that b the denial of such exemptions to copartnerships c the exemp tion of life insurance up to ten thousand dollars in favor of one legally dependent upon the deceased d the assessment to the hus band of the incomes of wife and children under eighteen years of age when not living separately and e the inclusion within taxable in come of the estimated rental of residence property occupied by the owner were all well within the legislative discretion The particularly novel feature of the Wisconsin law which allows a taxpayer to credit any personal tax which he may have paid against his income tax for that year was also specifically sanctioned Why the critics asked may taxes upon personalty be used to offset income tax when taxes upon real estate are denied the same privilege There is said to be no just ground for this distinction but it seems quite clear to us that there is in fact it seems to be rather a means of equalizing the burden of the new form of taxation than to be reallv an exemption It was evidently done with the idea of ac complishing without too violent a shock to taxing machinery the substantial elimination of personal property taxation and the sub stitution thereof of ability taxation The practical result is that both the taxpayer who has taxable personal property and the tax payer who has none pay taxes according to their ability as evidenced by their income196 Documents and Reports Mar 4 The Wisconsin law it will be remembered provides a sepa rate tariff of rates for corporations in which the rate of taxation is based upon the relation of the net income of the corporation to the assessed value of the property from which such income is derived This discriminative treatment was upheld by the court on the famil iar grounds that the privileges which are exclusively held by cor porations and the real difference between the situation of a corpor ation and an individual among which may be mentioned the fact that a corporation never is obliged to pay an inheritance tax plainly justify a difference of treatment in the levying of the income tax T

accruing are small in the aggregate they amount to a considerable sum Certain offices should be abolished and others classified The cost of handling in coming mail varies in the different departments from 584 to 8440 per thousand There is need of laborsaving devices copy work is carried on by expensive methods there is waste in the distribution of public documents unnecessary cost of insurance and

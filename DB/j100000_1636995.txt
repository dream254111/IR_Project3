Clay Prod ucts  by Heinrich Ries It seems to me that the criticisms thus set forth in the review are a trifle harsh and I would like to call atten tion to a few statements which seem inac curate The reviewer says The portion devoted to stone contains nothing that is not to be found in other easily available works The fact that the work contains much in formation taken from American and foreign publications not even to be obtained in such a library as the Carnegie Library of Pitts iburgh would indicate that the information is not all easily available while in truth a large part of it is practically unavailable to many of those who will make use of the book The second portion of the book that de voted to clay products he states is little more than an abbreviation of what the author has already included in his wellknown work  Clays their Origin Properties and Uses In his work on clays Dr Ries devotes 42 pages to structural clay products while in the book under criticism 130 pages are given over to the subject The new work contains 34 illustrations concerning clay products only 6 of which were given in the book on clays The section on clay products if compared at all with the similar portion of the earlier book is a decided amplification instead of an ab breviation All works of this character must be largely compilations and their value depends largely on the arrangement and the care in selecting the proper material from the wealth of pub lications at hand Dr Ries has apparently made good use of the available literature both American and foreign and has condensed it into a volume whose usefulness for the class of readers for which it is intended is I believe enhanced by such condensation HENRY LEIGHTON UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH QUOTATIONS CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT OF WESLEYAN UNIVERSITY AND THE PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS AND SOCIAL SCIENCE1 My Dear Prof FisherThe press far and wide contain articles relative to remarks in refer ence to the churches of the country reputed to have been uttered by you in a recent address in Hartford I desire to know whether or not you have been correctly reported If you have been incorrectly reported will you please give me an exact statement of what you did say Sincerely yours WILLIAM ARNOLD SHANKLIN My Dear Dr ShanklinIn reply to your letter just received I would say that the report of my remarks before The Get Together Club in Hart ford last Wednesday evening was substantially misleading Partly by the omission of qualifying statements which made the setting and shaped the interpretation partly by ascribing to me words and utterances which were not mine at all and perhaps partly by the striking headlines which raised brief incidental remarks into the prominence of a principal theme the original report upon which apparently many newspaper conclusions and comments have been based wasas I should judge decidedly unfair This judgment of mine is confirmed in some degree at least by the fact that the paper in which the report appeared was con strained by criticism in Hartford to offer me an opportunity to make corrections There was how ever a large underlying element of truth in the report I did not say that I would throw Sun day wide open or anything else of closely similar meaning But I did say that I would allow very great freedom of Sunday observance allowing a man pretty nearly anything that did not disturb the religious or other use of the day by others I did say that I saw no religious inconsistency in 1The letters are all dated from Middletown on January 27 254 SCIENCESCIENCE a mans having an uproarious good time on Sun day but I added that there should be no disturb ance of the religious or other duties of the day by others I did say that I would or that I believe that I would close up the churches temporarily as an experiment But I stated my reasons with emphasis because so many good religious people have come to think of church going as a great part of the whole religious duty and because if there were no churches open for a time these people would be constrained to turn to more important religious duties of kindly service and the like Just here I quoted the declaration of James as to the meaning of religion pure and undefiled The above will perhaps enable you to judge for yourself as to the degree of accuracy with which I was reported but for a slight amplification of which I have just written I am enclosing a copy of a letter which I sent in correction of the first report and which was printed in the paper first reporting me in its issue of last Saturday morn ing January 25th Of course not even all of what I am now placing at your disposal can make entirely clear my general attitude on Sunday observance but it is probably quite enough to make you to see how and in what light I stood last Wednesday evening Acnd that I am sure is all of your present wants Very sincerely yours WILLARD C FISHER My Dear Prof FisherYour letter of this date is just received Even after consideration of your explanation of your position I find it difficult to believe that any one with a just appreciation of the work which the churches have done and are doing for the religious and moral life of the com munity could seriously propose the closing of the churches even as a temporary experiment I am constrained to the conviction that your attitude in the matter is so far out of harmony with the spirit of the college which though in no wise sectarian is and always has been profoundly in sympathy with Christian churches that your con tinuance in your present official position is unde sirable for the college or for yourself I feel therefore compelled to request you to offer your resignation Most sincerely yours WILLIAM ARNOLD SHANKLIN My Dear Dr ShanrlinOf course I shall re spond at once to your request for my resignation 255 Here it is It is given cheerfully I trust and in full appreciation of the situation I do not expect I do not even undertake to frame for myself a judgment as to what I might think the correct course for the college to take in such a case But my judgment is not needed and it might be biased I am however free enough from prejudice to see very clearly that a college with the history and the constituency and support of Wesleyan is not exactly the place for a man who holds such views as mine and who can not suppress them I leave the college therefore without a trace of ill will toward anybody connected with it Indeed I go with the warmest wishes for the institution to which I have given the twenty best years of my life Very cordially yours WILLARD C FISHER My Dear Prof FisherI have your favor re signing from the faculty of Wesleyan University I hereby release you from your duties pending the presentation of your resignation to the board of trustees I shall recommend that your salary be paid in full for the present academic year Appreciating your spirit of good will to the college I am Most sincerely yours WILLIAM ARNOLD SHANKLIN SCIENTIFIC BOOKS Manual of Conchology Vol XXI Achati nellidem Amastrinae By ALPHEUS HYATT and HENRY A PILSBRY Leptachatina by C MONTAGUE COOKE Philadelphia 1911 The Manual of Conchology founded many years ago by George W Tryon was de signed to include descriptions of all the known living Mollusca In Tryons day it was essen tially a compilation but even so quite invalu able to conchologists When Tryon died and Dr H A Pilsbry took his place the char acter of the work changed and the new vol umes came more and more to represent ex haustive original research The treatment of the Helicidae for example put the whole sub ject on a new footing and stands today as one of the great classics of malacology Naturally the later parts have contained descriptions of fewer species than the early ones the more elaborate treatment requiring more space FIBRUARY 14 1913

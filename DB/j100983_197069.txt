Texas have little importance for international commerce except Galveston and Sabine Pass All the other indentations are too shallow to admit large vessels Sabine Pass is at the extreme southeast corner of the State The Government has spent large sums in improving the entrance to its landlocked lake and its business in lumber shipments is now important Its harbor is commodious and deep but its disadvantages are that it is not so conveniently situated as Galveston for communications with the interior of the State and furthermore the railroad system of Texas has been developed with Galveston in view as the natural geographical outlet by sea for the cotton cattle and other products of that region Galveston nearly 300 miles west of the Mississippi delta is centrally situated on the coast of the bestwatered most fertile and most populous part of Texas The Brazos valley the largest river basin in the State and growing the best and most abundant crops of cotton is directly tributary to it There are four large railroad centres in Texas from which lines radiate to all points of the compass and these receiving points are all feeders of Gal vestons commerce These railroad centres are Dallas surrounded by great areas of cotton and wheat lands Fort Worth the largest centre of  the Texas cattle trade Waco which forwards much of the export cotton of the Brazos valley and Houston where 7000 miles of railroads converge and which has both rail and water communication with Galveston Thus without Galveston the entire transportation system of the State as developed would be thrown into confusion The advantages of Galvestons geograph ical position and its excellent harbor and the consequent con vergence upon the port of the inland freight routes which tap large agricultural and grazing regions have made this city in recent years the second cotton port in the Union and doubled her export business between x892 and I899 Last year Galveston was the fourth export port of the country being surpassed only by New York Boston and Baltimore Thus while the development of Sabine Pass as a large seaport is mainly in the future the necessity for Galveston had already 357358 Geograsphical Record been demonstrated and its development achieved before the terri ble cyclone of September 8 nearly destroyed the city The re building of the port began as soon as possible after the calamity not only because there is need for it but also because there is no reason to believe that such a storm will ever again assail it and moreover experts express confidence that engineering works may be provided that will prevent the recurrence of such a disaster Light4 Half niwa 4l Texas City 0   o G A L V E S T OL sV L4 t PELICAN ISLAND St1  B A y QUARANTINE JUan Beacon a04 9 VsO gs  J

is nothing but a sand barrier piled up by the waves during the past few centuries in front of the mainland The island is over twentyfive miles long and from one to three and a half miles in width and the city stands some two miles from its northeast end at Fort Point The reentrant known as Galveston Bay formed by a number of flooded valleys extends into the mainland for about thirty miles north of the city but is everywhere too shallow for the use of the larger ships except a comparatively small area at the entrance toGeographica Record 3ai9 the bay and along the waterfront on the north side of the city This field however is large enough to meet the needs of a great commerce and is of sufficient depth to accommodate the largest modern vessels Between this singular depression and the deep water of the neighboring sea just in and outside the channel that forms the entrance to the harbor is the usual fringe of shoal water but it is only about two miles across It is here that the Govern ment has made improvements to facllitate entrance to the port About 8oooooo have been expended in building jetties extending from Fort Point and Bolivar Point two miles gulfward This large engineering work has been successful the channel has been scoured through and a permanent deepwater passage secured from the Gulf into the Bay Extensive dockage and warehouse facilities stood on the bay side of the city at the time of the cyclone and others were building Many wharves were injured only in parts of their superstructure The map shows the three railroad bridges and the wagon bridge that connected the port with the mainland All of them were swept away and eight railroads have now com bined to build for their purposes a doubletrack steel bridge ten feet higher than the singletrack bridges that were destroyed It was found after the storm that the port itself was scarcely injured and it has today a safe depth of twentyseven feet The city extends across the island from the Bay to the Gulf and its site is from six and a half to ten feet above mean tidelevel Earlier storms had given warnings but they were not so serious as to create apprehensions that the city could be overwhelmed as it was on September 8 A storm thirtythree years ago caused the water to rise about six and onehalf feet above mean tide flooding the lower levels of the town In the storm of 1875 the rise was a few inches higher while in I877 when the wind blew sixty miles an hour the rise was only a little over five feet In Septem ber last the wind exceeded a velocity of iOO miles an hour but was chiefly important as the cause of the high seas that wrought most of the destruction Galveston was in the vortex of the storm and was simultaneously overwhelmed by waves both from the Gulf and the Bay Still many buildings on the higher levels escaped absolute destruction while the ruin wrought on the lower levels was almost complete A number of engineers have sug gested plans for the future protection of the city and it is not unlikely that a Commission will be appointed to agree upon the best means of safeguarding this important seaport360 Geographical Record SAN DIEGO AS A SEAPORTTwo years ago San Diego Cal had practically no sea trade while today ocean vessels are dis charging merchandise there and loading with cotton and other products for the Orient This is due to the improvements recently made in the port The citizens have expended about  oooooo in wharves and the Government is completing a jetty at the harbor entrance by which means it is expected to scour out the sand and mud bottom so that the largest vessels may enter at any time As it is the depth of water at the entrance is twenty two and onehalf feet at low tide which is only two feet less than at San Francisco Jerchandise to the value of 2631599 was exported last year which was more than ten times the value of the export trade in I898 If the rate of exportation for the first quar ter of this year is maintained throughout the exports in 1900 will be at least 6oooooo The imports grew from 142I08 in I898 to I5ox588 in I899 The annual report of the San Diego Chamber of Commerce says it is expected there that the port in a few years will handle all the shipping trade of the southwest part of the country and an important share of the transcontinental trade San Diego is connected with the Southern Pacific system as well as the coast lines of railroads and as there is no practicable port for large shipping to the north till San Francisco is reached it is greatly to be desired that the advantages of San Diego may prove adequate for the development of a large commerce NATURAL GASThe Twentieth Annual Report df the United States Geological Survey says that though natural gas in this coun try has been much reduced in quantity it bids fair to be a resource of considerable importance for years to come The longcontinued drain is felt in nearly all the fields long worked but many com panies are keeping up a full supply to their customers by extending their pipelines to new grounds Thus the value of the natural gas produced in Ohio began to decline in i892 but the decline was arrested in I898 when the product was worth a third of a million dollars more than in I897 owing to increased production in the Lancaster field where new and vigorous wells were developed In some districts deeper drilling may tap new reservoirs and discov eries are likely to be made in territory not yet adequately explored Kansas for example has recently developed considerable new gas territory The consumption of natural gas is now far more econom ical than in the early years of its use as a given amount of effective work is now performed with less than onehalf the quantity of gasGeographical Record 361 that was required at the time of its introduction The estimated value of the coal and wood which it displaced in 1898 was over I8 000 000 Its largest use is to supply heat and light for domestic purposes It is found in many thousands of homes in the western parts of New York and Pennsylvania and in northern Indiana northwestern West Virginia northeastern and northwestern Ken tucky and soutbeastern Kansas It is also used for domestic pur poses to a smaller extent in Texas Utah Colorado California Illinois and Missouri Its use for industrial purposes did not in clude quite 1200 establishments in I898 and its restricted con sumption in this field will of course tend to prolong the life of the gas wells NEW GOLD FINDS IN ALASKAThough the Koyukuk river and its tributaries are not yet thoroughly explored mining prospectors have discovered mineral resources in that basin which promise to be of much value The Koyukuk about 700 miles in length is one of the two largest northern tributaries of the Yukon Its sources are not far from the Porcupine river the other large tributary and it flows to the west north of the Yukon Hills and then south joining the Yukon about 400 miles from its mouth Early in I898 a few miners located paydirt on the gold belt that runs through the territory about 6oo miles up the Koyukuk The reports last fall that they were doing finely led to the departure of several hundred miners from the Klondike in the spring of this year Consul J C McCook writes from Dawson that about 200 miners left that camp with pack horses and mules to take the overland trail from near Fort Yukon to the new fields and another party started on a steamboat for the mouth of the Koyukuk which they intended to ascend to the diggings The whole region is reported to be rich in gold indications A Government party will sledge up the Koyukuk on the river ice early next spring It will go to the Altenkakat tributary about threefourths of the way to the gold discoveries and then strike north up that river and carry on explorations through the unknown northern part of Alaska to the coast of the Arctic Ocean Supplies were cached last summer on the Altenkakat for the use of the ex ploring party next spring SURVEYS IN ALASKAIt is doubtful if knowledge of any other part of the world has grown so rapidly in the past two years as that of Alaska The Government surveys and explorations have been vigorously carried on in the past season A Geological Survey362 Geographical Record party under Mr E C Barnard has been making a topographical survey of the Seward Peninsula the westernmost extension of Alaska between Kotzebue and Norton Sounds The Cape Nome gold district is on its southwest coast and the newly discovered gold region of Cape York is on its northwest side The map of this region is to be on the scale of four miles to the inch Another party under Mr Alfred Brooks studied the gold resources in the Cape York district and another expedition including Mr W J Peters topographer and Mr W C Mendenhall geologist went inland from Kotzebue Sound to trace sotithward the goldbearing belt that seems to extend southwest across the peninsula and is now being worked at its southern terminus on the sea The Coast and Geodetic Survey also sent two steamers the Pathfinderand the Patterson to survey the entire coast from St Michael to Cape York and Port Clarence giving special attention to harbor facili ties if any exist Thus five expeditions have been at work on Seward Peninsula and its coasts and the result of this seasons pioneering in this northern part of Alaska is expected to throw as much light upon that region as last years surveys contributed to the knowledge of the more southern parts of the territory SOUTH AMERICA EXPLORATION IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURYProf Dr W Sievers in his exhaustive article on geographical exploration in South America in the present century Petermanns Afitteilungen VI 46 Bd igoo says that up to I875 no Government on that conti nent had sent out any expeditions or spent any money to explore the unknown parts of its territories Nearly all the exploration of this century excepting in Chile and Argentina has been the result of private enterprise mostly by European and North American ex plorers Thus none of the Cordilleran States from Venezuela to Chile has as yet emerged from the stage of rough pioneer ex ploration A considerable portion of their territory as in the south eastern part of Colombia is still almost wholly unknown Some of them like Bolivia have made no attempt except in small districts around their chief towns to carry out official surveys Conway who recently passed through New York on his return to the Bolivian Cordilleras is doing for Bolivia what other explorers chiefly German have done for the Ecuadorian ranges Among the Atlantic States the Guianas except for a narrow strip along the coasts are still on the threshold of exploration Brazil has no establishment like our Geological or Coast and Geodetic Survey to make a scientific studyGeographical Record 363 of any part of its vast domain All the official explorations in Brazil are the work of some of the individual States Scarcely a traveller has crossed any of the northeastern States from Maranhao to Per nambuco and much of the interior except along the river courses is still quite unknown The wide wildernesses between the large tributaries of the Amazon are comnpletely terra incognita In Argentina however very satisfactoryprogress in exploration has been made in the past quarter of a century In 1882 the first collected results of the Governments activity in this direction were the large atlas of the country prepared under the care of the geographer Seelstrang Argentina has geological and meteorolog ical establishments and foreign scientific men in the service of the State and the Universities whose labors have greatly enhanced the value of all official geographical work The systematic studywhich both Argentina and Chile have for some years given to the ranges along their common frontier has made a large portion of this the bestknown part of the South American Cordilleras The reason why Africa as a whole is better known today than South America is because so many European nations eager for foreign territorial acquisitions have so zealously participated in its exploration while in South America the poverty of the various States and their polit ical disturbances have prevented them from contributing largely to the knowledge of their own continent Thus there is more oppor tunity for pionieer exploration in South America than in any other continent though the Spaniards crossed it from sea to sea over three centuries ago and nearly every city on its coasts was founded in the era of the Columbian explorers THE HARBOR AT BUENOS AIRESThe Buenos Aires Herald says that the Argentine Government has spent in twelve years nearly 50000000 in building a series of docks and basins for the accom modation of the shipping at that port The mistake was made however of building a port without an adequate entrance to it No preliminary study was given to the variable currents of the La Plata nor any heed to the fact that enormous quantities of silt surcharge the river waters Channels for the admittance of vessels were dug right across the currents and they filled or partly filled with silt nearly as fast as they were dug The result is that the approaches to the fine series of docks are lamentably inferior to their capacity and to the demands of commerce The Government has now ap pointed an expert Commission to study all the conditions and report a practical plan for the construction of an enduring approach364 Geographical Record EUROPE POPULATION OF SARDINIA AND SICILYA Cossu who has made a study Riv Geog Ital Easc 11IZI I898 of the distribution of the population of Sardinia in respect of distance from the sea finds that since I845 the population has been gradually increasing near the sea and decreasing inland At an earlier period the malarial coasts and the attacks of pirates were strong influ ences driving population inland At present however the den sity of population on the coast of the island is 46 to the square kilometer from the coast to five kilometers inland 34 and further inland from 22 to 3I The steep and malarial coast facing Italy is for considerable distances almost uninhabited This study recalls the investigation made by 0 Marinelli in I893 on the dis tribution of population in Sicily He ascertained the fact that while the greatest density of the northern and eastern slopes is found on the coasts that of the southern or African slope occurs en tirely at a height above sealevel of over 1300 feet He attributed this fact to the influence of malaria and the unsettled state of the country in the Middle Ages when the population was driven inland In discussing these conclusions Dr Theobald Fischer Petermanns Mitteilungen I893 No 8 expressed the opinion that the scanty population along the African coast is due still more to the natural characteristics of that coast where the steep cliff of tertiary strata affords no natural harbors and where there were no suitable sites for strongholds to repel the attacks of pirates from the Barbary coast Furthermore the rainfall is small there is little level ground for cultivation springs are scanty and even the principal streams afford poor facilities for irrigation POLAR REGIONS THE DUKE OF THE ABRUZZI returned to Tromso in the Stella Polare on the 6th of September His ship was fast in the ice for eleven months and her sides were crushed by the pressure She was pushed on the land and four sledge parties were sent out to make explorations One of these parties composed of a Norwegian and two Italians never returned Another led by Capt Cagni was gone 105 days and reached the highest latitude yet recorded86 33 N The general health of the party was good throughout the voyage and there was comparatively little suffering On the iith of September the Duke arrived at Christiania and was received with the greatest enthusiasm Nansen welcomed him on behalf of the University and at night there was a grand torch light processionGeografhical Record 365 LIEUT AMDRUPS GREENLAND EXPEDITION arrived at Copen hagen on the 4th of October The party landed at Cape Dalton 69 25 N on the igth of July and Lieut Andrup mapped the coast to 67 20 the point at which the work ended in I899 Dr Hartz at the same time was employed in exploring and charting the coast to the northward as far as Scoresby Sound Two ANDREE Buoys have been discovered One marked No 3 was picked up in the open sea on the west coast of Iceland on the 7th of July When opened at Stockholm in the presence of Nordenskiold Nathorst and others it was found to be empty The second buoy No 4 was reported from Skjervb Norway on the 3Ist of August It contained a notice that it was thrown out at IO PM on the iith of July At the time of writing the balloon was at an altitude of 250 metres 820 feet and moving in the direc tion N IO East A postscript adds that the direction had changed to N 450 E that the balloon was above very rugged ice with splenidid weather and that four carrier pigeons had been released and were flying west Andree made his ascent July II I897 CAPTAIN BAUENDAHL was to leave Hamburg in themiddle of August on an expedition to the North Pole He describes his plan in a communication dated July i9oo There go with me a pilot R Dressler and five seamen The vessel is a deepsea fishing boat the Matador of 44 tons It has no engine I propose to make for the packice north of Spitzbergen and then to steer to the eastward till I come to open water or a channel which seems to offer a passage for the ship to the north If I find the water I shall push as far north as possible till the way is closed when 1 shall leave the vessel perhaps at the Seven Islands and press on over the ice with the crew and the provisions It depends upon the currents the ice the land and other condi tions whether the return route shall be by way of Franz Josef Land or Greenland or in some other direction My reasons for choosing my route and method are that previous attempts to reach the Pole in ships have been frustrated by the masses of ice or when open water invited advance by the dread of risking the vessel and the desire to keep it for a base So far as I know no one has yet pushed his ship into the packice northeast of Spitz bergen Parry in 1827 found himself north of Spitzbergen where owing to the encounter of the Gulf Stream with the Polar current the wall of ice seems to be especially compact It appears to me that more to the eastward the conditions may be such as to afford an opportunity for progress with a ship Should we find ourselves compelled to take to the ice we know from the examples of the Hansa and the Polaris that men can travel over the icefield if they have sufficient food and fuel I carry enough of these for two yearsa weight that is of about 200 hundred weightto drag with us at first but I hope to make my way even over rough ground and to obtain at the same time scientific geographical results366 Geographical Record Whatever Capt Bauendahl may do in the Arctic his success in finding six men to help him pull a load of ten tons to the North Pole is a remarkable feat and all must wish him and them a safe deliverance from a ship with such an evil name as MAatador MR WILLIAM ZIEGLER of New York proposes to fit out and dispatch an expedition to the North Pole in the summer of I9OI There will be two ships and the leader of the expedition will be Mr Evelyn B Baldwin who was with Peary in Greenland in I893 and a member of the Walter Weliman party in Franz Josef Land in I89899 Mr Baldwin has been attached to the U S Weather Bureau The Berlin correspondent of the London Standard gives some details of the construction of the ship for the German Antarctic Expedition It is a wooden threemasted schooner with stronig ribs and triple woodwork of oak pitch pine and greenheart for protection against the ice pressure It is hoped by this means to obtain sufficient strength without adopting the peculiar form of the Fram The ship will have a tripleexpansion engine capable of an average speed of seven knots The space under the forecastle will be prepared for about fifty draught dogs All the available space will be turned into coalbunkers Besides five ordinary boats an oak naphthaboat will be taken six metres long and two broad and capable of holding fourteen to twenty persons or 2500 kilograms The engine of four horsepower will give the boat a speed of from four to five knots A captive balloon with the necessary filling apparatus and a searchlight apparatus will be taken also a wind mill for the working of the dynamoengine when the boiler is not under steam Termination Island geographically still little known will probably form the first objective point of the expedition

to look upon the commercial crisis much as an epidemic of smallpox was regarded before the days of Jenner as a mys terious act of God which cannot be foreseen or understood and can only be endured with what fortitude the sufferers are able to command Even in the minds of students of eco nomics it is to be feared that a certain degree of haziness still exists in connection with this subject The list of reasons which have been advanced at various times in explanation of panics is a long and amusing one In several recent publica tions the  sunspot theory  is discussed with diverting serious ness and a late issue of a foreign magazine contains elaborate charts endeavoring to establish a relation between poor crops and crises It is stated that the late P D Armour cabled from Europe early in 1893 to his representatives in America instructing them to secure and store away in vaults one million dollars in gold It is known that during the panic later in that year Armour  Co were well supplied with ready money Evi dently Mr Armour was able to see in action certain forces which induced him to believe that a crisis was imminent although the collapse of 1893 took the public completely by surprise It is equally evident that his action assisted in bringing about the panic which he foresaw In this article an effort will be made to trace out a little more fully than has heretofore been done the principle which operates to produce trade cycles The first point to which attention should be directed is the absolute impossibility in practical affairs of separating specu lation from the natural action of demand and supply Even in the simplest consumptive purchases the element of foresight is frequently present If a man accustomed to wear a partic ular brand of shirts sees them for sale at halfprice he is likely to buy an extra halfdozen He accumulates a stock in the294 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS expectation of higher prices When the housewife goes to her grocery on bargaind y and finds sugar selling at 5 cents a pound the ruling price being 6 cents she will almost cer tainly purchase more of it on that account in anticipation of future wants In fact in cities where the retail stores com pete with each other by means of frequent  special sales the women bargainhunters become shrewd speculators Even the schoolboy seeing pencils for sale at 3 cents each two for 5 cents will often buy two expecting eventually to need the second Economists have paid much attention to the fact that the buyer will purchase at the cheapest place but have said little about the secondary principle that he will try to buy at the cheapest time In primitive societies this secondary principle has no application worthy of mention among wageearners it is unimportant though occasionally operative but with managers from the applewoman on the corner to the presi dent of a railway system it has a scope and effectiveness second only to the fundamental axioms of demand and supply Society may be roughly divided into the following five groups arranged according to the degree to which business transac tions are affected by the effort to speculate Group 1 Those who work for wages and buy only for consumption The attempts of this class to foresee and profit by changes in value are for the most part sporadic and without important influence Under exceptional circum stances however when some striking development has at tracted public attention there may be such a general effort to anticipate future consumption as seriously to derange the normal action of demand For example during the socalled Leiter corner in wheat in 189798 many persons became so excited over newspaper accounts of the rapid exhaustion of supplies that they purchased at the prevailing high prices sufficient flour to last till a new crop should be available a fact undoubtedly influential in bringing about the astonishing absence of consumptive demand which was observable in the final month of that crop year Group 2 Those who work independently like small farmers and shopkeepers In the United States this repreTRADE CYCLES 295 sents a large portion of the population and includes some of the most persistent speculators It is only in the newest and least developed of the agricultural sections that crops are sold as soon as harvested and the number of farmers who hold their wheat corn oats or cotton with the intention of selling on an advance in prices is constantly growing The wider diffusion of information in regard to prices and market pros pects and the steady increase in intelligence and range of thought among the farming population are resulting in more and more discrimination as to when produce shall be sold During the period of low prices following 1893 the accumu lation of wheat corn and oats in country elevators cribs and barns was on a scale by no means generally appreciated In some sections every farmer had on hand from one to three full crops of corn It is this invisible reserve which has come forward to swamp nearly every corner attempted on the prod uce exchanges A considerable number of farmers have even learned the tricks of the speculative trade and sell their grain as soon after harvest as practicable purchasing at the same time an equal or double amount of  options  at Chicago or Minneapolis to be carried on margins until they consider the price satisfactory an attempt to  eat their cake and have it too which results profitably only when very discreetly con ducted Others anticipate the course of prices still further by selling their crop for future delivery before it is harvested The business of the small storekeeper requires him to antic ipate the demands of his customers and even if he does not attempt to foresee the actual course of prices he must neces sarily carry a light stock in times of depression and a heavy one during periods of active trade In handling such com modities as flour or meal the average dealer will make some effort to buy at favorable times and to j educe his stocks when he fears a decline Group 3 Entrepreneurs Others may speculate but the entrepreneur seeking to steer a profitable course between the Scylla of expenses of production and the Charybdis of com petitive marketing must do so to be successful Judgment and foresight are the most essential qualities in the manager of a business enterprise His earnings of management are296 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS very closely dependent upon his success in carrying out Roth schilds injunction to  buy cheap and sell dear The manu facturer who buys only when material is immediately needed and sells his goods at the market price as soon as they are finished will inevitably fall behind in the race In 1897 the Atchison Railway made large purchases of rails to be substituted for the lighter weights previously in use The advance in price was so great during the time these rails were being laid that the old ones pulled up were in many instances sold for more than the cost of the new The same road spent nearly all its earnings on improvements and reduc tions of grade during the time when material and labor were cheap and traffic light thereby securing greatly increased returns when its business subsequently improved Shrewd iron manufacturers made quick fortunes by acquiring plants for a song in 189697 and getting them in readiness for heavy production during the subsequent sensational advance in prices When choice must be made between a manager of great executive ability and one of exceptional foresight the latter will be selected in a majority of instances Executive ability can be readily furnished by assistants but speculative shrewd ness hardly ever Group 4 Investors Those who have capital to invest are certain to apply their utmost ability in seeking to foresee the course of prices for the commodity or security in which they are interested With the recent great multiplication of cor porations whose shares are listed on the stock exchanges inves tors show a constantly increasing readiness to sell out when they consider prices high and repurchase a different property or at a different time so that it is frequently difficult to dis tinguish between the investor and the unmixed speculator Group 5 Speculators That a considerable portion of the population is either permanently or temporarily identified with this class is a fact as well known as it is regrettable At one time or another nearly every one succumbs to the insidious at tack of the  getrichquick  microbe  I suppose said the writer to a sedate Colorado schoolmistress to make conversa tion I suppose every second person in your State has a little mining stock laid away worth about 15 cents a shareTRADE CYCLES 297 Yes she replied with unexpected frankness  but I hardly think mine is worth that much The recent surprising popu larity of margintrading in stocks is a conspicuous instance of this tendency The above cursory outline of the influence upon business of what might be called the instinct of anticipation is far from exhausting the subject but it will suffice to introduce the dis cussion of trade cycles The effort to speculate for the most part unrecognized and often almost unconscious and in its temporary effect upon demand practically indistinguishable from actual consumption permeates in varying degrees the en tire social structure For purposes of illustration it may be well to touch briefly upon stock exchange cycles It is of course understood that the prices of securities fluctuate in accordance with the earning capacity of the properties represented keeping pace roughly with the activity of business This movement is a part of the universal trade cycle and is merely the most con spicuous result of the conditions we are seeking to analyze But within and subordinate to this broad general movement are numerous lesser stock exchange cycles which have but little connection with the remaining business of the country The study of the process by which  margin  accounts are fed fattened and slaughtered on the stock exchange would hardly be worthy the serious attention of the economist were it not for the fact that speculative forces elsewhere inextri cably commingled with demand and supply are here almost isolated and can therefore be more readily examined and classified The fluctuations of prices on an exchange represent an eter nal contest between on the one hand investors who consider 1 the rate of interest present and prospective obtainable on capital put into a security at current quotations and 2 the risk involved and who make no special effort to forecast the course of prices from day to day and on the other hand the gambling class of speculators who are entirely indifferent to dividends earning power or actual value provided they can 4 get right on the immediate action of the market For example A controls a large capital which he is always298 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS seeking to invest to the best possible advantage By judicious selection he finds himself able to secure an average return of 5 per cent Accordingly if he sees a railway stock of recog nized safety paying 5 per cent on a par value of 100 selling at such a price as to yield 5A per cent on the cost he is likely to invest therein some portion of his funds In a time of de clining prices he will probably instruct his broker to stand ready to buy the stock at 91 If prices subsequently advance to a point where this security returns only 41 per cent on the current quotation he will dispose of his holdings giving his broker instructions to sell at 111 B however will buy the stock as quickly at 111 as at 91 provided he thinks it will go higher and may be equally ready to  sell short at 91 if he expects a further decline As with most economic groupings these two classes shade gradually into each other by imper ceptible degrees The action of the investor tends to lessen fluctuations and is usually beneficial both to himself and to so ciety as a whole while the action of the gambler tends to widen fluctuations and is invariably injurious both to himself and to society The lesser stock exchange cycle may conveniently be said to run from panic to panic with the understanding that the word panic is here used to signify merely a sharp excited decline in stock prices which frequently occurs without any apparent effect on other lines of business The selling which causes a panic of this character is liquidation by disappointed gamblers who bought at higher prices in expectation of a further advance Many of them are forced to sell out because their margins are exhausted The decline continues until prices reach a level where investors are willing to buy Their purchases gradually absorb the floating supply of stocks which was pressing upon the market and check the downward ten dency A period of dullness follows Any further decline meets a constantly increasing number of standing orders to buy but the enthusiasm of speculators has been temporarily dampened and there are few purchases on advances This lasts until the farsighted begin to see ahead a strong probability of condi tions sufficiently favorable to induce active public speculationTRADE CYCLES 299 The shrewdest operators begin to buy paying a slight advance Others soon perceive that the tendency of the market is up ward and hasten to make their purchases while prices are still relatively low By this time the market begins to  look strong buyers are more confident and a generally advancing tendency interrupted by numerous reactions continues until investors find prices high enough to make it to their advantage to begin selling Then each further rise meets resting orders to sell until a large number of stocks pass from those who own them as interestbearing investments to those who buy only as a speculation and that for the most part with borrowed money Two of the tricks in vogue among this class of gamblers may be mentioned as we shall subsequently find that they have their counterparts in the trade cycle The  pyramider  buys more and more heavily as prices advance using his profit on the first purchase as  margin  on the second For example he directs his broker to double the line every five points up  a form of insanity which would be incredible if it were not so common The buyer of  calls  pays a fixed price usually ten dollars a hundred shares for the privilege of buying within a specified time at a price above the present market his expecta tion being that before the stipulated period has expired the stock will have advanced sufficiently to give him a profit on the transaction When at length sales by investors become heavy enough to start a decline these reckless speculators are in sore trouble The greatly increased floating supply of securities is bandied about from one to another at lower and lower prices bearing sorrow and disaster in its train till finally the grand aircastle raised by human greed again collapses in panic The inciden tal variations of this programme are infinite as both investors and speculators are influenced by concurrent financial and political events but the underlying and eventually controlling principles are as above outlined It is seen immediately that the differences between the purely speculative cycle and the industrial cycle are much more im portant than the similarities First the total supply of securi ties is practically constant being neither produced nor con300 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS sumed in the economic sense of those terms Some stocks may be retired or exchanged or an issue may be increased if the charter permits and new companies will be floated from time to time but under ordinary circumstances these incidental changes in quantity do not seriously modify the general char acter of the cycle The speculative principle predominates to such an extent as to be almost supreme But in considering the industrial cycle we have a body of goods never twice the same constantly increased by production and as steadily decreased by consumption The law of demand and supply predominates and the instinct of anticipation has only a second ary influence We may therefore expect to find the general swing of trade fluctuations so much longer and more varied than the stock exchange cycle as almost to defy comparison Second Securities bear interest or are expected to do so while goods do not Consequently when commodity prices are declining there is not always present a large body of inves tors waiting to buy In the case of an article which is in general use and can be kept indefinitely like corn this makes but little difference as investors know that it will always have value and that declining prices will check production and stimulate consumption Hence many are ready to buy at any considerable concession in price But articles produced to satisfy a particular want may be almost unsalable when that want disappears If for example retailers and jobbers find themselves greatly overstocked with bicycles owing to any decrease in the purchasing power of the people the machines may command only a nominal price for before the public recovers its ability to buy the style desired may have com pletely changed or the sport passed out of fashion Business men say that such an article is worth whatever you can sell it for Accordingly we may expect that the fall of prices will be relatively more severe in an industrial depression than in course of a purely stock exchange cycle The latter is dis cussed here not because of any intrinsic importance but merely to assist in elucidating a principle The trade cycle has been said to include ten or eleven years on an average roughly divisible into three years of depressed trade three of advancing trade and three of excited tradeTRADE CYCLES 301 followed by a panic It is doubtful if such a classification is of any real assistance to the student as it loses in accuracy more than it gains in definiteness Perhaps the most that can be said is that a panic is always followed by a period of depres sion varying in length according to circumstances a second period of advancing prices and increasing activity which may or may not be interrupted by important reactions and a third period of prosperous trade often accompanied by excited speculation culminating in a shorter period of contraction which is usually at some portion of its course sufficiently sud den and severe to be termed a panic During the period of depression production and consump tion partially disorganized and unbalanced by the preceding collapse gradually readjust themselves upon a smaller scale to accord with the new conditions The people as a whole feel themselves poorer Many have lost heavily by the deprecia tion of their property Every one is economizing using fewer or cheaper goods Since consumption is thus reduced pro duction must be correspondingly cut down Less money is received as wages hence less can be spent in consumption and so on in a vicious circle The people are spending less because they are receiving less and are receiving less because they are spending less The circulation of the body politic has become sluggish Capitalists have no courage to invest in new enter prises and those already established are conducted cautiously if not timidly Idle currency accumulates in bank and govern ment vaults This condition prevails until some event occurs to give prices an upward start It may be a political change or a new government policy which convinces capitalists generally that the time is favorable for new undertakings and induces them to pay out money as wages for the construction of railways factories mines etc thus putting into active circulation some of the currency previously lying idle and increasing the con sumptive demand by wageearners without a corresponding immediate increase in the supply of consumers goods It may be heavy government expenditures obtained by borrowing as in war mortgaging the future for the benefit of the present It may be the discovery of extensive gold mines provided the302 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS new gold is spent so as to increase consumptive demand If it is merely stored in bank vaults and the owner given credit for its value in dollars its service in setting trade in motion will be slight and indirect Again the stimulating event may be increased sales of goods abroad and under modern conditions this is usually the most important feature Although the commercial relationship of different nations is now so close that a panic in any one of them is felt by the others the resulting fall of prices is far the most severe in the country which contains the primary cause of disturbance Consequently that nation finds itself in a position to sell goods in competitive markets to much better advantage than before Foreign consumers discover that they can buy cheaper in that country and an increase in its exports follows While sales to other nations are growing imports are declin ing The feeling of poverty among the people lessens their purchases of foreignmade goods and the fall of prices at home makes it relatively more advantageous for them to patronize domestic producers Less money is spent abroad by travellers and interest payments to foreign stock and bondholders are smaller because of the comparative depression and unprofit ableness of home industries Increasing sales to other countries and decreasing pur chases from them can have but one ultimate result the re ceipt of money in payment of the balance due Foreign exchange gradually weakens to the goldimporting point and an inward flow begins Such receipts cannot pile up in bank vaults The money is sent to pay for goods and finds its way directly or indirectly to the producers of those goods For the most part capitalists have anticipated its arrival by pay ments to farmers for their products and to wageearners for their labor Thus imports of gold are speedily converted into effective demand for goods The first result of this increased purchasing power on the part of consumers is the renewed activity of established in dustries So long as the demand does not exceed the capacity of the favorably situated portion of the existing producing plant there is little advance in pricesTRADE CYCLES 303 It is at this stage that the operations of the irrepressible speculator begin to have noticeable effect During the pre ceding period of depression there has been little inducement to buy anything in the hope of selling it higher A few thoughtful men have been expecting history to repeat itself and the trade cycle to take its natural course but they have been uncertain when the advance would begin and the same experience which led them to predict a recovery also taught them that there would be ample opportunity to make pur chases after the appearance of definite indications of coming improvement When this class perceive an actual increase in demand for goods based upon reasons which seem to them good and sufficient they accept it as a signal that an era of active trade and rising prices is at hand A very few have been shrewd enough just to anticipate this increased demand by acquiring industrial plants in advance at low prices These are the stuff of which millionaires are made At this point the effort to profit by foresight is confined almost entirely to investors and business managers The gen eral public is still sceptical of any permanent improvement Many farmers take advantage of the first little rise in the price of grain to dispose of what they have carried through the period of depression and only a few continue to hold and ac cumulate for a further advance Small shopkeepers are cau tious about increasing their stocks of goods But shrewd investors are buying up interestpaying properties or those which they believe soon will be interestpaying and the wide awake entrepreneur is increasing his stocks of raw material and is a little less urgent in his efforts to sell the finished product Thus the first increase in demand due to the greater pur chasing power of consumers is closely followed and in the case of some few individuals even accompanied or preceded by a second increase caused by the effort to speculate and as soon as this combined demand passes the capacity of the favor ably situated portion of the existing producing plant rising prices result There soon appears a great pressure of capital seeking in vestment During the period of depression there has been304 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS but little accumulation of new capital The profits of success ful enterprises have scarcely exceeded the losses of others There has been a constant transfer but very little net in crease Production has been upon such a reduced scale as merely to meet current consumption without leaving much surplus to be laid by as capital But now that trade is again active there is a steady accumulation of funds in investors hands awaiting profitable employment Stocks and bonds are gradually absorbed until they reach prices that yield but a small rate of interest on the investment This advance in securities accompanied as it always is by active stock exchange speculation calls public attention to the upward trend of prices and has an important sympathetic effect on commodities Dealers on the produce exchanges adduce the lively stock market as a reason for higher prices on grains A constantly increasing number of people begin to perceive that a period of advancing prices is in progress Some speculate definitely and intentionally buying what they do not want in the expectation of selling it at a profit The vast majority however merely buy quickly what they would otherwise have bought cautiously and sell slowly what they would otherwise have sold urgently In buying they pay the sellers price and in selling they set their own figures and hold to them tenaciously thus continually aiding the advanc ing tendency but at the same time slightly increasing their stocks on hand The next stage may be called the period of new enterprises Accumulating capital overflows existing opportunities for in vestment and seeks other outlets New projects for transpor tation manufacture mining agricultural plantations oil wells etc find ready support among those whose growing funds would elsewhere net them but a low rate of interest Some of these enterprises are sound and secure Others are over capitalized and will need to go through assignment and re organization before reaching a permanently paying basis Still others are founded upon misrepresentations and ready to be bowled over by the first passing breeze which chills the enthusiasm of speculators Rising prices are accompanied by decreasing exports andTRADE CYCLES 305 increasing imports Foreign buyers are unwilling to pay the advance and find it profitable to purchase elsewhere Foreign sellers discover that the higher scale of prices gives them a surplus above transportation charges on some new classes of goods If prices were dependent only upon the mathematical prin ciples of demand and supply an equilibrium would soon be established among the pricescales of the various commercial nations disturbed indeed by variations in crops mines wars pestilences etc but always like water seeking its level and not under the control of any broad tidelike oscillations But owing to the workings of the instinct of anticipation the up ward movement of prices in the country we are considering has acquired momentum The public is convinced that  prosperity  has come to stay and it is a curious fact that in the minds of the vast majority the idea of prosperity is inseparably connected with advanc ing prices At least nine men out of ten are natural opti mists If it were not for that fact civilization would make slow progress for the one permanently successful enterprise rises out of the ashes of nine failures Stockbrokers will tell you that 90 per cent of their customers are  bulls Some years have passed since the last panic and the pain ful lesson then impressed upon the public mind has become dimmed by lapse of time From being overcautious dar ing the period of depression the people in general have now swung to the opposite extreme and have become overcon fident The higher prices go the more speculation increases the more ready is the buyer of goods to pay a slight advance and the less urgent is the seller to dispose of stocks on hand Entrepreneurs everywhere are inclined to branch out to put their profits into the enlargement of their business in a manner similar to  pyramiding  in the stock market Even the consumer usually has on hand at this period more goods than he had during the preceding depression The farmer has considerable supplies of grain  Times are good he says so that there is little risk in carrying it and prices are likely to be higher The merchant is having a lively trade and is well stocked up The entrepreneur has a quantity of306 Q UAR TERL Y JO URNAL OF ECONOMICS raw material on hand to forestall delays and more contracted for He also has a considerable stock of finished goods for which he anticipates an easy sale Investors own stocks and other property bought at high figures Every one is speculat ing consciously or unconsciously seeking to anticipate the ex pected continuance of good times and high prices and nearly every one is  loaded  with goods Real estate is the last to boom because great activity in building operations cannot prevail until the people have ac cumulated sufficient funds to pay for new and better accom modations Speculation in land often runs to absurd extremes so that large sums are paid for the  option  on a property for a specified time agreements exactly equivalent to privi leges  on the stock or produce exchanges Such a condition of the real estate market is apt to mark the culmination of a period of prosperous trade Decreasing exports and increasing imports soon result in an outward movement of money to pay the balance Since sales of goods to other nations lessen the quantity at home and purchases abroad increase domestic supplies this shifting in foreign trade causes an enlargement of stocks on hand A nation which sells less and buys more without any correspond ing immediate decrease in production must accumulate and exports of gold are the visible sign of this accumulation The most important influence of gold shipments however is in causing the shrewdest class of business men to begin sell ing their least desirable property and stocks of goods It is a maxim among such that there is a time when it pays better to allow money to lie idle than to invest it in any other form of property When the rise in prices began these men turned their money capital into goods so far as practicable They now fear falling prices and therefore turn their goods into bankable funds To put it in another way farsighted men buy money because that goes up when everything else goes down As yet they are content to leave it in the banks where interest is paid on it while at the same time it appreciates through declining prices When the ablest business men thus dispose of their prop erty they must necessarily sell it to those less keen in anticiTRADE CYCLES 307 rating and therefore as a rule less wealthy The general public has at that time no more expectation of falling prices than it had of a rise during the period of depression The people are confident even enthusiastic and relatively prosper ous Consequently the shares of many companies previously held chiefly by a few wealthy men are found to have become distributed among a great number of smaller owners and in many instances a considerable portion are held on  margin Shrewd entrepreneurs get rid of stocks on hand with the re sult that those not 8o shrewd are left with an extra quantity Everywhere property is passing from those who know to those who do not know and from those who own to those who hold largely on credit A sells property to B and puts the money in the bank The bank lends money to B with which to pay for the property As the number of those who wish to turn goods into money increases it is observed that prices are showing irregularity and a spasmodic tendency to decline At first the majority of the public expect an early recovery and hold on while those who are already overloaded grit their teeth and borrow more money But the desire to liquidate spreads like ripples from a stone dropped into a pool The idea that it is a time to sell rather than buy or hold property gradually penetrates to suc cessively lower grades of business sagacity The pressure of offerings increases as prices yield and some of the more ex tensive borrowers find their credit approaching exhaustion Eventually a point is reached where the keenest capitalists begin to fear an epidemic of failures and consequent embar rassment of the banks At such a time the actual possession of cash is of far more value to the manager of extensive en terprises than any interest obtainable from the banks as it protects him against every possibility and ramification of fail ures gives him ready money for use in his business at a time when that blessing is enjoyed by few and enables him to loan to his less farsighted associates at exorbitant rates With conditions as above outlined the attempt to accumu late cash even by a comparatively small number of wealthy men will precipitate a panic The withdrawal of twenty or thirty millions of currency from New York banks for ex308 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS ample would be sufficient to cause tight money and a brisk calling of loans If underlying conditions were sound such a contraction would be merely an incident but when a great number of firms are in unstable equilibrium as it were each leaning upon the others by means of intermingled credits the collapse of any one pulls down more To complete the illustration given a few paragraphs back A sells property to B and puts the proceeds in the bank The bank lends money to B with which to pay for the property A next withdraws his money from the bank in cash thus com pelling the bank to recall its loan from B B is then forced to sell the property back to A at whatever price A is willing to pay for it Stated in this personal fashion it would appear that A had acted very meanly in the matter and it is that view which led some to charge the capitalist class with producing the panic of 1893 by conspiracy In point of fact no such agreement is possible under present conditions though one great financial interest might follow anothers example Each individual is merely seeking to protect himself from apprehended dangers To withdraw cash at such a period is clearly unpatriotic but for any one individual to refuse to do so on that ground might result in loss to himself without averting disaster from others If we let A represent a class those shrewd or lucky enough to prepare for liquidation and panic and B another class cov ering all the rest of the propertyowning population then the above illustration is an exact epitome of the descending por tion of the trade cycle A rise in the moneyvalue of goods is slow and pleasant but the advance in the goodsvalue of money the fall of prices  is short sharp and painful Goods accumulated gradually in the inspiration of hope are thrown recklessly overboard under the pressure of bankruptcy or the spell of fear It is the survival of the strongest intellectually and financially and the decline and subsequent depression will not end until the weak are thoroughly eliminated Moreover the hoarding of currency in time of panic so lessens the circulating medium as seriously to interfere with the ordinary processes of exchanging goods It is a periodical breakdown of theTRADE CYCLES 309 social machinery and one for which our economic and politi cal engineers have so far been unable to suggest any adequate remedy The credit system is responsible for both the extent of the advance in prices and the violence of the decline and is the sole cause of the panic which results from the hoarding of cash as without credit there would be no fear of bank failures but it is not the cause of that seesaw movement between goods and money which is termed the trade cycle The effort to anticipate higher prices would still exist if credit were un known Wheat affords an excellent illustration of the effect of spec ulative sentiment on prices apart from the influence of demand and supply proper The per capita consumption of that grain does not appreciably increase in prosperous times as whatever tendency there may be to an enlarged use in some directions is fully balanced by the more extensive substitution of meat and vegetables among wageearners Yet it is a wellknown fact that other things being equal the price of wheat averages considerably higher during periods of activity than in times of depression The reason why the trade cycle is a modern phenomenon is immediately evident It is the growth of public intelligence which has led to the wellnigh universal development of the attempt to foresee and anticipate the effect of future events on prices A popular novelist represents one of his characters as suggesting the following modification of the Golden Rule Do unto others what they would like to do to you and do it first The effort to speculate increases with the growing smartness  of the people It would seem that some of the time spent in discussing the periodicity of crises might better have been employed in pro ductive labor Since the beginning of railway transportation there have been four great panics in the United States 1837 1857 1873 and 1893 There were also intermediate reactions in trade in 1847 and 1884 The Civil War so deranged indus trial conditions between 1857 and 1873 as to overshadow other influences The shortening up of that tidal period was appar ently due to the immense expenditures of the government and310 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS the inflation of the currency which acted as a powerful stimu lus to advancing prices It seems selfevident that the dura tion of a trade cycle must depend largely upon the special conditions which tend to retard or accelerate the action of natural forces It is plain that the development of the  trust  system and the consequent centralization of industry may have an impor tant effect in lessening the severity of periods of liquidation and panic but the full discussion of that question would take us beyond the limits of this article In conclusion the primary cause of the trade cycle is the effort of buyers and sellers to anticipate a rise in prices This produces a fictitious enlargement of demand beyond real con sumptive requirements and finally results in the accumulation of considerable stocks of goods At the same time prices pass above the average international level Buyers at these figures are necessarily less shrewd and on the average less wealthy than sellers so that the first important unfavorable develop ment finds much property in weak hands and causes a disas trous decline Price fluctuations are increased in extent and severity by the credit system G C SELDEN CHICAGO July 30 1901

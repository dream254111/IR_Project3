structure has been observed of which no other animal is as yet known to partake In cutting through the eye four processes were met with arising by distinct tendons from the internal or posterior portion of the scle rotic which passing forward gradually became broader and insen sibly lost themselves in and formed a part of the choroid These processes had a muscular appearance The ciliary processes were affixed to the crystalline lens which was nearly spherical with the anterior surface somewhat flattened Concerning the use of this structure especially of the processes the author observes that as the natural unwieldiness of this animal probably unfits it for quickly directing its sight to objects which for its own preservation it ought to be able to examine easily and mi nutely nature seems to have supplied it with an apparatus calculated to remedy this imperfection The change in the eye which adapts it for distinct vision at different distances the author ascribes in a great measure to the four abovementioned processes which upon contracting will shorten the axis of the eye and produce the desired effect for near objects it is observed that this animal has the eyes placed much nearer the mouth than any other whence without any adaptation of the eye it is capable of performing the most essential of its functions viz that of examining the food necessary for its sub sistence Demonstration of a Theorem by which such Portions of the Solidity of a Sphere are assigned as admit an algebraic Expression By Robert Woodhouse AM Fellow of Caius College Cambridge Communi cated by Joseph Planta Esq SecRS Read February 12 1801 Phil Trans 1801 p 153 In the second volume of the Memoirs of the National Institute M Bossut announces a theorem relative to the solidity of a sphere similar to Vivianis by which quadrable portions of a hemispherical vault are assigned M Bossut withholds the analysis that led him to his result but mentions that it involves an integration much more complicated than that which occurs in Vivianis problem In the present paper Mr Woodhouse furnishes the analysis that leads to the result announced in Bossuts theorem and by a transformation of the coordinates of the sphere arrives at a differential expressioln the integration of which does ilot appear more complicated than that employed in the solution of Vivianis problem Account of the Discovery of Silver in Herland Copper Mine By John Hawkins Esq Communicated by the Right Hon Sir Joseph Banks Bart KB PRS Read February 12 1801 Phil Trans 1801 p 159 This ore was found in the Herland mine about six miles from St Michaels Mount in Cornwall It consists chiefly of lodes of43 copper of which several run nearly in a parallel direction from east to west The peculiarity here is that there are several cross courses which run north and south the greatest part of which contain no metal these meeting with the lodes of copper ore interrupt their continuity or as is expressed by the miners heave them out of their direction so that at the place of intersection the copper lodes seem to have been forced aside eighteen or twenty inches One of these cross courses has of late been discovered to yield silver in no inconsider able quantity but with this particular circumstance that at and near the place of intersection the ores both of silver and copper are much less productive than at some distance from it The silver ore con sists of a mixture of galena native bismuth gray cobalt vitreous silver and native silver chiefly in a capillary form Account of an Elephants Tusk in which the Iron Head of a Spear was found imibedded By Mr Charles Combe of Exeter College Oxford In a Letter to the Right Hon Sir Joseph Banks Bart KB PRS Read February 19 1801 Phil Trans 1801 p 165 This tusk which weighed fifty pounds and measured about six feet in length is supposed to have been imported from Africa and was purchased at Liverpool by a manufacturer of Birmingham On shaking it a rattling noise was heard near the middle part which on cutting the tooth transversely was found to be occasioned by an iron spearhead about six inches and a half long which lay in the longitudinal direction of the tooth with the point foremost and was considerably corroded It is conjectured that the spear had entered at the basis of the trunk between the interior angle of the eye and the proboscis tlhe cavity of the tusk being placed immediately be neath this part From the quantity of bony matter that had been formed round this extraneous body it is inferred that the animal must have lived a considerable time after it had received the wound The spearhead and the part of the tooth in which it had been im bedded were exhibited to the Society at the close of the Meeting Description of the Arseniates of Copper and of Iron from the County of Cornwall By the Count de Bournon Communicated by the Right Hon Sir Joseph BanksBartKB PR S ReadFebruary 19 1801 Phil Trans 1801p 169 In the mine called Huel Gorland in the parish of Gwennap in Cornwall has lately been discovered a species of ore consisting of different combinations of the arsenic acid with copper and iron which though some mention have been made of it by German writers as having been found in Silesia appears yet from the great abundance afforded by the abovementioned mine to be almost pe culiar to this country After an historical account of the little that has hitherto been known concerning this substance Count Bournon

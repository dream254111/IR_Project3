his daughters a portion of the real tate which had been devised to him by the will of his wife and after his death his daughter Mrs Clarke filed her bill in which she made all of the other children of Thomas J Carter including Florence Seefried parties defendant averring that the deed from her father to Florence Seefried wcs executed at a time when the grantors mind had become greatly impaired that he was subject to hallucinations and that he was totally incap able of making a valid deed or contract of any kind The bill prays a petition of the real estate of which he died seised in kind if such partition may be had and if it cannot be done with due regard to the rights of all parties that it may be sold and the proceeds divided among the parties entitled thereto There was an amended bill in order to introduce an additional party and for the purpose of setting forth as an additional ground of relief that under the terms of the will of Mary J Carter a trust in said tract of land was created for the benefit of the plaintiff and her sisters that the execution of the trust was imposed by the terms of the will on Thomas J Carter who had no right power or authority to dispose of the same in any manner other than that specified in the will namely by its division between the children of Mary J Carter and that for these reasons the deed of April 15 1907 from Thomas J Carter to Florence C Seefried was a violation of the trust created by the will and therefore null and void and that since Carter not only neglected and refused to perform the trust imposed upon him by said will but committed an express breach of the same the complainant and her sisters are entitled to have the trust enforced for their benefit by a court of equity and the land divided among all the children of Mary J Carter the testatrix There was a second amended bill the only object of which was to introduce an additional party These bills were demurred to upon several grounds viz 1 BIecause the court was without jurisdiction to hear the case 2 because the interpretation placed by the bill upon the will of Mrs Carter the mother of Florence Seefried is not correct 3 because the plaintiff attempts by bill in chancery to try the title to real estate and 4 because if the plaintiff has any remedy it is by an action of ejectment 1 The plaintiff and the defendants all deduce their title 1912 181182 18 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER  July from the will of Mary J Carter The object of the bill is the partition of certain real estate among those entitled To the accomplishment of this object it was necessary to remove the deed by which Thomas J Carter had conveyed the greater portion of the real estate in controversy to his daughter Flor ence Seefried To accomplish this object the bill states two propositions either one of which if well founded is fatal to that deed and to the rights of those claiming under it The first proposition is that the deed is invalid because the grantor was mentally incapable of executing such a deed and secondly that by force of the trust created by the will of Mary J Carter her husband and devisee Thomas J Carter had no power to execute such a deed It will be observed that the object of the bill is one over which a court of equity has undoubted jurisdiction that its sole purpose its sole object is to secure a partition of real estate among the parties in interest This right if the bill be true may be established and this point may be reached by one of two routes either of which accomplishes the result and if the allegations of the bill are true and upon demurrer they are taken to be true and deed which is the subject of attack is of no effect for both reasons Section 2562 of Code 1904 declares that tenants in common joint tenants and coparceners shall be compellable to make partition and in the last clause it is provided that any court having general equity jurisdiction of the county or corporation wherein the estate or any part thereof is shall have jurisdic tion in cases of partition and in the exercise of such jurisdic tion may take cognizance of all questions of law affecting the legal title that may arise in any proceedings as well between ten ants in common joint tenants and coparcencers as others Davis v Tebbs 81 Va 600 Fry v Payne 82 Va 759 1 S E 197 Bradley v Zehmer 82 Va 685 Pillow v S W V Imp Co 92 Va 144 23 S E 32 53 Am

the Legisla ture has manifested a purpose to broaden and extend the juris diction of courts in partition suits and that whenever a ques tion has arisen in a partition suit which the statute was held to be not broad enough to embrace the Legislature has promptly met the situation by an amendment the latest of which is that of 1903 As the act stood before that date and as it is found in the Acts of 189798 at page 488 the language of the last clause was that a court of equity shall have jurisdiction in cases of partition and in the exercise of such jurisdiction may takeSEEFRIED ET AL V CLARKE ET AL cognizance of all questions of law affecting the legal title that may arise in any proceedings  but it having been suggested that this only conferred jurisdiction to pass upon questions arising between tenants in common joint tenants and copar ceners the act of 1903 was passed Acts 190234 p 836 which adds immediately after proceedings in the conclusion of the statute the words as well between tenants in common joint tenants and coparceners as others We shall not undertake either an inclusive or an exclusive demarcation of the lines of jurisdiction under this very broad grant of power We have no doubt that it is sufficient to com prehend the case before us 2 The cases upon the subject of multifariousness in bills are very numerous We shall refer to only a few of them In Snyder v Grandstaff 96 Va 473 31 S E 647 70 Am St Rep 863 it is said A bill is not rendered multifarious by presenting alternative views or different aspects of the same facts There must be distinct collocations of distinct and dif ferent facts each presenting different rights and calling for dif ferent relief to render a bill multifarious In Hill v Hill 79 Va 592 it is said that a bill is usually deemed multifarious for containing different causes of suit against same persons when two things concur to wit the dif ferent causes must be wholly distinct and each cause must be sufficient as stated to sustain a billciting Huff v Thrash 75 Va 550 But there is no general rule applicable to all cases Segar v Parish 61 Va 679 And where the causes though distinct are not absolutely independent of each other and it will be more convenient to dispose of them in one suit the objection for multifariousness will not prevail If the plaintiff in this suit fdr instance had filed a bill ask ing for partition making the proper parties and alleging her right to partition upon the ground that the deed from her father to Florence Seefried was void because the will under which he took the devise had created a trust in favor of all his children and had filed another bill asking partition of the identical prop erty among the same beneficiaries and attacking the same deed because the grantor was mentally incompetent to make a deed the court had the matter been called to its attention would not have allowed the defendants to be harrassed and subjected to costs in two suits between the same parties and having the same object in view but would have required them to be heard together for convenience and economy in the administration of justice In School Board v Farish 92 Va 160 23 S E 222 it is said that courts in dealing with the question of multifariousness look particularly to convenience in the administration of jus 1912  183184 18 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER  July tice and if this is accomplished by the mode of proceeding adopted the objection of multifariousness will not lie unless the course pursued is so injurious to one party as to make it inequita ble to accomplish the general convenience at his expense So that when we look to see if a bill is multifarious the first question to be determined is Does the bill purpose to reach the end aimed at in a convenient way for all concerned And if the mode adopted does accomplish the end of convenience then the ques tion arises Is any one hurt by it or so injured as to make it unjust for the suit to be maintained in that form In Spooner z Hilbish 92 Va 333 23 S E 751 the same principle is announced See Campbell v Mackey 1 My  Cr 603 Nulton v Isaacs 71 Va 726 Almond v Wilson 75 Va 623 We think the demurrer to the bill was properly overruled 3 Does the will of Mary J Carter create a trust for the benefit of all of her children The clause to be construed reads as follows I will and bequeath to my said husband his heirs executors adminis trators or assigns all of my estate real and personal with one simple request that the said estate be devided with my children or its equivalents as his better judgment may direct In the construction of wills the object is to ascertain the meaning of the testator A will is but the legal declaration of a persons mind his intent his wish his will as to the disposi tion of his property after his death That will mlay be expressed in terms of command of recommendation of entreaty of re quest and if from the language used the court can ascertain the will of the testator if the suggestion or the recommendation or the wish be certain and if the beneficiaries of the wish be also certain the courts will give effect to it In this case the testatrix makes what she terms a simple request that the said estate be divided with my children or its equivalents as his better judgment may direct There is no question here about who are the beneficiaries there is no question as to what the language used operates upon The word request is fit and suitable to express the will of the testatrix and its force is not diminished but is rather emphasized by the use of the word simple It means direct clear Web ster It is as though she had said I make this direct re quest Nor do we think that by the use of the terms as his better judgment may direct that the testatrix meant to clothe her husband with an arbitrary discretion with respect to the divi sion of her estate If in the execution of the duty imposed upon him he had divided the property unequally the questionSEEFRIED ET AL V CLARKE ET AL might well have been raised as to the measure and extent of the discretion reposed in him but that case is not before us The doctrine of precatory trusts is recognized in our decisions though the subject has not been very frequently considered In Harrison v Harrison 43 Va 1 44 Am Dec 365 the testator said In the utmost confidence in my beloved wife I leave to her all my worldly goods to sell or keep for distribution amongst our dear children as she may think proper My whole estate real and personal are left in fee simple to her only requesting her to make an equal distribution amongst our heirs and desiring her to do for some of my faithful servants what ever she may think will most conduce to their welfare without regard to the interest of my heirs It was held that the widow was invested subject to the payment of testators debts with the legal title to the whole estate real and personal that she took the beneficial interest in the estate for life that the chil dren of the marriage took a vested remainder in fee in the estate to commence in possession at the widows death or earlier at her election and that precatory words in a will are sufficient to create a trust where the subject and the object are certain Roney v Roney 34 Va 13 Bisphams Principles of Equity treating of this subject at page 85 says from the decisions upon this subject and from the principles upon which the general law of trusts is based certain rules may be derived by which the construction of instru ments containing precatory expressions is to be governed The question in all cases is whether a trust was or was not intended to be created or in other words whether the testator de signed to leave the application or nonapplication of the sub jectmatter of the bequest to the designated object entirely to the discretion of the donee or whether his meaning was that his language should be deemed imperative and that such dis cretion should be excluded This is usually considered by the best authorities to depend upon three things First upon the general terms 6f the will secondly upon the certainty of the subject matter and thirdly upon certainty of the object In the case before us no light is to be derived from the con sideration of the context Without doubt the first clause of the will vests a feesimple estate in the devisee but that fact is a very general concomitant of precatory trusts As we have already seen the subjectmatter and the objects of the trust are beyond cavil and dispute Continuing the same author says Precatorv expressions ought prima facie to be considered as imperative and to ex clude discretion the wish of a testator no matter how ex pressed if expressed clearly should be regarded as a command This is the opinion of Lord Redesdale in Carry v Carry 1912 185186 18 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER  July 2 Scho  Lef 189 and although the dicta in some subsequent cases would seem to be in favor of giving a less decided effect to words of recommendation or request yet it is conceived that the above statement of the rule is justified by the best considered decisions both in England and in this country It is seldom indeed that expressions of this nature are found standing alone and hot strengthened or qualified or controlled by the context but when they do stand alone they ought to be considered as imposing an obligation and not merely as constituting a request which the person to whom it is ad dressed is at liberty to disregard The reason is obvious A will in its very nature is the disposition which the testator desires to have made of his estate after his death All expres sions in it indicative of his wish or will are commands 3 Pomn Eq Jur 3d Ed 1905 The subject of precatory trusts was fully considered by the Supreme Court of the United States in Colton v Colton 127 U S 300 8 Sup Ct 1164 32 L Ed 138 A great number of cases of English courts and of state courts were cited by counsel and considered by the court The testator by will gave to his wife all of his estate real and personal and then added I recommend to her the care and protection of my mother and sister and request her to make such gift and pro vision for them as in her judgment will be best No one can read that will and the will under consideration without being im pressed with the strong likeness between them There is the gift of the entire estate to his wife whom he recom mends and requests to make such gift and provision for his mother and sister as in her judgment will be best The language is certainly not more imperative than in the will of Mrs Carter and the concluding language of the clauses in each will is equally strong to sustain the argument in favor of an unrestricted discretion Mr Justice Matthews speaking for the court said The entire estate bequeathed to his widow is affected by this request Is that request equivalent to a com mand or is it a mere solicitation which after his death she may reject alnd disregard without violating the terms of his will and the conditions upon l which she accepted her estate under it    U ndoubtedly he gives to her some discretion on the sub ject the gift and provision which he requests for his mother and sister is to be such as in her judgment will be best It is to be such as will be best for them having regard to all the circumstances both of their necessities and the amount and suffi ciency of the estate and this proportion which is to constitute what shall be best is to be determined by the widow in the ex ercise of her judgment It is her judgment that is to be called into exercise and this excludes caprice whim and every merelySEEFRIED ET AL V CLARKE ET AL arbitrary award but whatever the judgment may be and what ever discretion is involved in its exercise it operates only upon the nature form character and amount of the gift and provi sion intended for them The fact of a gift and provision is pre supposed and stands on its own ground Her judgment is not invoked as to that The only ambiguity in respect to whether there shall be a gift and provision or not resides in the single word request Does that mean a wish of the testator which he intended to be fulfilled out of the means which he had furnished to make it effectual or does it mean a posthumous petition which the testator understood himself as addressing to the favor and good will of his sole legatee Discuceitg this phase of the subject the court goes on to say It is an error to suppose that the word request necessarily imports an option to refuse and excludes the idea of obedience as a corresponding duty If a testator requests his executor to pay a given sum to a particu lar person the legacy would be complete and recoverable Ac cording to its context and manifest use an expression of de sire or wish will often be equivalent to a positive direction where that is the evident purpose and meaning of the testator as where a testator desired that all of his just debts and those of a firm for which he was not liable should be paid as soon as convenient after his decease it was construed to operate as a legacy in favor of the creditors of the latter Burt v Herron 66 Pa 400 And in such a case as the present it would be but natural for the testator to suppose that a request which in its terms implied no alternative addressed to his widow and prin cipal legatee would be understood and obeyed as strictly as though it were couched in the language of direction and com mand In such a case according to the phrase of Lord Lough borough in Malim v Keighley 2 Ves Jr 333 529 the mode is only civility The court then considers the objection that the trust sought to be established by the will in that case was incapable of being executed by reason of uncertainty as to the form and extent of the provision intended and because it involved the exercise of discretionary power on the part of the trustee which a court of equity has no rightful authority to control and quotes with approval from Lewin on Trusts 4th Eng Ed  2 402 403 where it is said that it is quite true that where the manner of executing a trust is left to the discretion of trustees and they are willing to act and there is no mala fides the court will not ordinarily control their discretion as to the way in which they exercise the power so that if a fund be applicable to the main tenance of children at the discretion of trustees the court will not take upon itself in the first instance to regulate the main 1912  187188 18 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER  July tenance but will leave it to the trustees But the court will in terfere wherever the exercise of the discretion by the trustees is infected with fraud or misbehavior or they decline to under take the duty of exercising the discretion or generally where the discretion is mischievously and erroneously exercised as if a trustee be authorized to lay out money upon government or real or personal security and the trust fund is outstanding upon any hazardous security In Costabadie v Costabadie 6 Hare 410 Vice Chancellor Wigram on this subject said If the gift be subject to the discretion of another person so long as that person exercises a sound and honest discretion I am not aware of any principle or any authority upon which the court should deprive the party of that discretionary power Where a proper and honest discre tion is exercised the legatee takes all that the testator gave or intended that he should have that is so much as in the honest and reasonable exercise of that discretion he is entitled to That is the measure of the legacy But it is always for the court eventually to say when called upon whether the discretion has been either exercised at all or exercised honestly and in good faith Colton v Colton supra Summing up the whole discussion on the point the Supreme Court in Colton z Colton supra concludes If the trustee re fuses altogether to exercise the discretion with which he is in vested the trust must not on that account be defeated unless by its terms it is made dependent upon the will of the trustee himself In this case the trustee died not only without executing the trust but after committing a breach of the trust by conveying the greater part of the trust estate to one of the beneficiaries and leaving the others almost wholly unprovided for We shall not enter into a discussion of what the testatrix meant by saying that the estate was to be divided with her children and how far that expression differs from a trust to be divided by the trustee among his children The husband is dead intestate If he had divided the estate with his children and died intestate his share would have been divisible among all his children If as we have before said he had un dertaken to execute the trust by an unequal division among his children a somewhat different case would have been presented but upon the facts of the case in judgment we are of opinion that a trust was created by the will of Mary J Carter for the equal benefit of all her children and as the decree of the cir cuit court appealed from reaches that conclusion we are of opin ion that it should be affirmed AffirmedSEEFRIED ET AL V CLARKE ET AL Note MultifariousnessThis case briefly decides that the rule as to multifariousness in Virginia hereafter is merely a rule of conven ience especially if no injustice is done the other party and that wherever the suits would be consolidated if maintained separately a demurrer for multifariousness will be overruled In other words a very strong and plain case must be made out to throw a suit out of court for this fault The original bill was filed to set aside a deed on the ground that it was executed at a time when the grantors mind had become greatly impaired etc The parties then completely changed front and filed an amended bill setting forth that the grantor in execut ing the deed violated the terms of a precatory trust But the court was clearly right in overruling the demurrer in this case because it has been recently decided that where it is ap parent from the whole scope of an amended bill that it was intended to accomplish the same object for which the original bill was filed the bill as amended will not be deemed multifarious although there may be particular charges in the amended bill apparently in tended to base relief on a different ground from that stated in the original bill Hutchinson v Maxwell 100 Va 169 170 40 S E 655 Precatory TrustsThe clear and forceful opinion of the court in this case on the much vexed and difficult question of precatory trusts settles finally in this jurisdiction the rule that a simple re quest by the testator in his will that the donee exercise his dis cretion in a designated manner is to be regarded as imperative and as creating a precatory trust where the subject and the object are certain The precatory words need not be used in an imperative sense In other words precatory expressions are prima facie to be consid ered as imperative and to exclude discretion the wish of a testa tor no matter how expressed if expressed clearly should be re garded as a command Even when these expressions of recommen dation or request are found standing alone as in the principal case and are not strengthened qualified or controlled by the context they ought to be considered as imposing an obligation and not merely as constituting a request which the person to whom it is addressed is at liberty to disregard This is a decision of great importance and undoubtedly sustains the intention of the testator in this class of trusts which should al ways be the endeavor of the judicial expositor but which is so often violated even after the court carefully announces that this in tention is the pole star of construction This is a favorite form of devise or bequest by one spouse to another where either dies with out having lost confidence in the survivor that he or she will carry out the wishes of the deceased That this confidence is often re posed and betrayed is shown in the principal case See letter of the late John R Tucker in II Va Law Register 231 on the ultimate decision of the court of appeals in the case of Reid v Blackstone 55 Va 363 A precatory trust was thereby up held 1912  189

Abstract,i207043,185 The result of these experiments was as follows The wootz of the 1st cake reduced 0139 its own weight of lead That of the 2nd  0125 3rd  0120  4th  0156 5th  0102  Steel containing V its weight of carbon 0094 its own weight of lead White cast iron  0228  From these experiments the author says it appears that wootz contains a greater proportion of carbonaceous matter than the com mon sorts of cast steel and that some particular cakes approach very near to the nature of cast iron This added to the imperfect re duction seems to him quite sufficient to account for its refractory nature and for the want of homogeneity in its texture Notwithstanding the above imperfections Mr Mushet thinks wootz possesses the radical principles of good steel and that it is impossible not to have a very high opinion of the excellence of the ore from which it is produced the possession of which for the fabrication of steel and bar iron would be an object of the highest importance It is he says a subject of regret that such a source of wealth cannot be annexed to the dominions of this country as in that case the East India Company might supply their settlements with an article su perior in quality and inferior in price to any they send from this country Abstract of Observations on a diaurncal Varitation of the Barometer be tween the Tropics By J Horsburgh Esq In a Letter to Henry Cavendish Esq FRS Read March 14 1805 Phil Trans 1805 p 177 It appears from Mr Horsburghs journal that in steady weather within the tropics a regular elevation and depression of the baro meter takes place twice in every twentyfour hours the greatest de pression being about four oclock morning and evening and the greatest elevation being from eight in the morning till noon and from nine or ten in the evening till midnight In a letter which accompanies the journal dated Bombay April 20th 1804 Mr Horsburgh says he has observed since his arrival in India that the atmosphere appears to affect the barometer differently at sea from what it does on shore As a proof of this Mr Hors burgh gives a series of observations made on two barometers one by Troughton the other by Ramsden of which the following is an abstract From the time of leaving the Lands End on April 19th 1802 the mercury was fluctuating and irregular till April 29th lat 26 N long 20 W when it constantly performed two elevations and two depressions every twentyfour hours These Mr Horsburgh calls equatropical motions From lat 260 to 10 the difference in the high and low stations of the mercury was not so great as it was from186 the latter latitude across the equator and from thence to lat 250 S Within the lastmentioned limits the difference was very consider able being generally from five to nine hundredths of an inch both in the day and the night When the ship arrived in lat 280 S long 27 W June 7th the mercury no longer performed the equatropical motions but was irre gular and fluctuating until July 11th when the ship was in latitude 27 S long 510 E The equatropical motions then took place again and continued with great regularity while the ship sailed up the Madagascar Archipelago and across the equator until the arrival of the ship at Bombay on the 31st of July On the 6th of August the barometers were placed on shore and from that day to the 12th the mercury appeared to have a small tendency towards the equatropical motions from the latter day to the 22nd of the same month that tendency was so much diminished as to be generally imperceptible On the 23rd of August the barometers were again put on board the ship which left the harbour of Bombay on the 26th The mer cury then immediately began again to perform the equatropical mo tions and continued them with great uniformity down the Malabar coast across the bay of Bengal in the strait of Malacca and through the China Sea until the ship arrived in Canton river on the 4th of October The mercury then became nearly stationary or if it showed at times a small inclination towards the equatropical mo tions such inclination was not by any means so perceptible as at sea The ship remained at Canton till the 2nd of December and al though there appeared at times a slight tendency in the mercury to perform the equatropical motions the rise and fall was in general so small as to be frequently imperceptible but on the departure of the ship from Canton river the motions instantly took place and con tinued until the ship arrived in Bombay harbour on the 11th of Ja nuary 1803 From that day to the 23rd of May the ship remained at Bombay and during the whole of that time no tendency towards the equa tropical motions worth noticing could be perceived On the above mentioned day the instant the ship left the harbour the motions of the mercury again took place and continued but not always with equal regularity until the 2nd of July when the ship again entered Canton river During the time the ship continued at Canton no appearance of the motions here treated of worth remarking could be perceived but as soon as the ship left the river on the 13th of September they again took place and continued until the 13th of October when upon entering the Strait of Sincapore they appeared to be diminish ed but reassumed their usual appearance as soon as the ship had passed the narrow part of the strait On the 21st of October the ship arrived in the harbour of Prince of Waless Island and a great diminution again took place in the equatropical motions but upon187 leaving the harbour on the 5th of November they again returned and continued with their usual regularity until the arrival of the ship at the entrance of Hoogly river on the 3rd of December While the ship continued in the lower part of that river a slight tendency to the equatropical motions might be perceived but up the river at Diamond harbour the mercury was nearly stationary the whole twentyfour hours On the 13th of January 1804 after clearing Hoogly river the equatropical motions again returned and continued until the arrival of the ship at Bombay on the 12th of February from which day to the 18th when the journal ceases no signs of the above motions could be perceived Concerning the Differences in the magnetic Needle on Board the Inves tigator arising from an Alteration in the Direction of the Ships Head By Matthew Flinders Esq Commander of His Majestys Ship Investigator In a Letter to the Right Hon Sir Joseph Banks KB PRS Read March 28 1805 Phil Trans 1805 p 186 In the years 1801 and 1802 while Capt Flinders on board the Investigator was surveying the south coast of New Holland he ob served a difference in the direction of the magnetic needle for which there appeared no other cause than that of the ships head being in a different direction The compasses made use of on board the above mentioned ship were of Walkers construction one excepted which was made by Adams and it appears from a table of observations given by Capt Flinders that some of the variations here treated of were 40 less and others 40 greater than the truth It also appears that when this error was to the west the ships head was to the east or nearly so when the error was eastward the ships head was in a contrary direction and when the observations agree best with those taken on shore which may be considered as having the true variation the ships head was nearly north or south A minute in spection of the table seems to favour the opinion that the excess or diminution of the variation was generally in proportion to the incli nation of the ships head from the magnetic meridian on either side Capt Flinders having ascertained the certainty of a difference in the compass arising from an alteration in the point steered thought it necessary when he wanted a set of bearings from a point where the ship tacked to take one set just before and another immediately after that operation Several specimens of the manner in which these bearings were taken are given also a specimen of the plan he fol lowed in protracting such bearings these specimens axe in the form of tables and are not of a nature to be abridged With respect to the cause of the differences here treated of Capt Flinders offers the following conjectures 1 st That the attractive power of the different substances in a ship which are capable of affecting the compass is brought into a sort of focal point nearly in the centre of the Ship where the shot are de

BANKRUPTCYBUILDING AND LOAN ASSOCIATIONSA building and loan association cannot be made the subject of involuntary procedings under the National Bankruptcy Act of 1898 Matter of N Y B  L Banking Co U S D C S D N Y 30 N Y Law Journal 1223 Per Holt J In determining the question involved it is not necessary to consider the English decisions or the decisions under the earlier American bankrupt acts The authorities under the present act seem decisive They hold in sub stance that the intention of the present Bankrupt Act the provisions of which are much more restrictive than those of the earlier bankrupt acts was to exclude from the operation of the act banks railroad telegraph and express companies and all corporations except those mentioned in the act By the provisions of the present act the corporations which can be put into involuntary bankruptcy are those engaged principally in manufactur ing trading printing publishing mining or merchantile pursuits These terms are to be taken in their natural and usual meaning and any corpora tion which does not come within such meaning cannot be put into bank ruptcy T think that an ordinary building and loan association is not a cor poration which is included in the provision quoted Admittedly the only kind of corporation described in the act which it can be claimed to be is one engaged principally in either manufacturing trading or mercantile pur suits I think that it does not come within any of these descriptions No direct decision that a building and loan association cannot be put into bankruptcy has been brought to my attention but the great weight of au thority in analogous cases supports the view that they cannot The follow ing classes of corporations for instance have been held not to be subject to the present

REGISTER nates and the constant discussion of the subjectknowledge of defectsis to be found in Mosheuvel v Distict of Columbia 24 Sup Ct 57 decided November 30 1903 by the Supreme Court of the United States Its in terest is increased by the fact that the judgment of the lower court for the defendant was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals and that upon appeal to the Supreme Court this judgment was affirmed by a divided court reargued and a year later reversed three justices dissenting The ruling is as follows One who with knowledge of the situation elects in descending the steps from her residence to the sidewalk to cross over a projecting uncovered water box about 4 inches square with its outer edge about 4 inches from a line drawn from the tread of the step nearest the sidewalk to the ground instead of avoiding the box by stepping to one side is not as a matter of law guilty of such contributory negligence as will defeat her action against the municipality to recover damages for the personal injuries sustained by reason of her failure to clear the box The case of District of Columbia v Brewer 7 App D C 113 was urged by counsel for the District as conclusive in its favor After an examination of that case the court through Mr Justice White proceeds to give its conceptions of the merits of the question as follows From this analysis of the opinion in the Brewer Case we find it difficult to say precisely upon what theory the ruling there made was treated as de cisive of this case We say this for the reason that the conclusion of the court in that case would seem to have been placed upon the very dangerous condition of the street and the extreme hazard arising from its use under the circumstances thus precluding every reasonable inference that Brewer could consistently with ordinary prudence have elected to use the street at the time and under the conditions shown by the undisputed proof It is insisted however that the Brewer Case was held by the court below to be applicable to this because it was deemed that it had been decided in that case that where a defect existed in a highway and was known to one who elected to use such highway such election even if it were justified by the dictates of ordinary prudence nevertheless must be held as a matter of law to entail the consequences of a want of ordinary care and prudence And this proposition substantially embodies the asserted principle of law which was relied upon at bar as sustaining the judgment below We are of the opinion however that the rule as thus contended for is unfounded in reason and unsupported by the weight of authority When analyzed the proposition comes to this that no person can as a matter of law without assuming all the risk use the streets of a municipality where he knows of a defect therein even although it be that in the exer cise of a sound judgment it might be deemed that with ordinary care and prudence the street could be used with safety The result of admitting the doctrine would be to hold that all persons in making use of the public streets assumed all risks possibly to arise from every known defect or danger That this is the result of the proposition may be aptly illustrated Take a street across which runs a railroad track whereon cars are moved by steam or other motive power All persons knowing of this fact would 832 Janknow also that there was some danger in crossing They therefore must either abstain altogether from crossing or if they do so be subject as a matter of law to the consequence of the reckless operation of the railway without reference to the care exercised in the use of the street for the pur pose of crossing Indeed the proposition would imply that everyone who used the public streets with the knowledge of a defect existing therein would be guilty if an injury was by them suffered as a result of such defect of contributory negligence without the existence of any neglect whatever for this would necessarily result from saying that one who had made a careful use of the streets was yet guilty of neglect in doing so Reduced to its last analysis the principle contended for but asserts that the ordinary rules by which negligence is to be determined do not apply to the use of the public streets since those who use such streets with a knowledge of a possible danger to arise from a defect therein must as a matter of law have negligence imputed to them although in choosing to make use of the streets and in the mode of use the fullest possible degree of judgment and care was exercised The result of this would be to re lieve the municipality of all duty and consequent responsibility concerning defects in highways provided only it chose to give notice of the existence of the defects   Such a doctrine is inconsistent with reasoi and as we shall now proceed to point out is in conflict with what we deem to be the weight of authority FEDERAL ANTITRUST ACTWHAT CONTRACTS DO

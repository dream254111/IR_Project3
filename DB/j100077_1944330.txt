passed compre hensive corrupt practice laws In the two latter states the provisions of the Oregon primary law were followed closely and the plan of publishing a state pamphlet stating reasons for the election or defeat of the respective candidates and furnishing a copy to each elector of the state was adopted Forty days before the primary thirty three days by the Wyoming law candidates may file with the secretary of state their portraits and statements of the reasons why they should be nominated Those who oppose them may file the reason of their opposition Space in the pamphlet is sold at a rate per page varying with the importance of the office sought In Indiana it ranges from 100 per page for a candidate for United States senator or congressman for governor secretary of state or state treasurer to 10 per page for assemblymen additional space not to exceed three pages is pro curable at the rate of 100 per page or 25 per page depending upon the office In Wyoming the price per page varies from 200 to 100 additional space being sold at 100 per page The secretary of state publishes these statements in a pamphlet six by nine inches in size and mails a copy to each registered voter in the state The Wyoming law makes further provision for the filing of statements by political committees prior to the general election relative to their party principles and candidates and for publishing and distributing these statements by the secretary of state The amount which a candidate may spend in the primary or election exclusive of the expense for space in the official pamphlet is limited by the North Dakota law to fifteen per cent of one years salary of the office he seeks although 100 is allowed in any case The Wyoming law allows an expenditure not to exceed twenty per cent of one years salary with a minimum allowance of 200 Illegal expen ditures under the North Dakota act embrace contributions during ones candidacy to religious political or charitable causes the gift of intoxicating liquors to influence electors payments for transportingNOTES ON CURRENT LEGISLATION 237 voters to the polls or for any loss they have sustained through attend ance at the polls and hiring workers on primary or election day Badges or insignia may not be sold or worn near the polls nor may electioneering be done on election day The Wyoming law prohibits payments for political services by candidates or political committees except for the endorsement of candidacy through the papers for securing signatures to nomination papers and such expenses as are connected with the holding of public meetings or with the gratuitous service of writers and speakers the distribution of literature conducting headquarters and payments for traveling expenses telegraphing etc Both the North Dakota and the Wyoming laws prohibit political contributions from cor porations Candidates and political committees must keep detailed accounts of election receipts and expenses and file statements thereof with the secretary of state or with the county clerk at the close of the campaign The Wyoming law requires statements from all persons expending more than 50 The North Dakota law forbids preelection promises of appointment and prohibits the insertion in papers or periodicals of paid political material unless it is stated that such material is a paid advertisement The violation of these corrupt practice laws is punishable by a fine not in excess of 1000 and imprisonment in the county jail For failure to file statements of expense a candidate is liable to a fine of 25 for each days delay and his name may not be placed upon the official ballot until such a statement is filed The Wyoming law gives the circuit court of the county where statements of expense should be filed exclusive original jurisdiction of all violations of the act with power to declare the election of any candidate void Prosecutions under this act are advanced on the court docket over all pending civil actions and witnesses are not excused from testifying on the grounds that their testimony would render them criminally liable or expose them to public ignominy While the Wyoming law requires each political committee to operate through a responsible treasurer this provision is more care fully covered in the Indiana statute The latter state has followed the Maryland law more closely than any other and has also borrowed the English plan of requiring candidates to work through political agents This latter provision is aimed at what has constituted a fruitful source of corruption that is the irresponsible distribution238 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW of campaign funds These laws are drawn on the theory that funds should be expended only by such agents as have sufficient authority to bind their principals The treasurer of a political committee is compelled to give a bond for the faithful performance of his duties No one except a candidate may make any political contribution within six months of any election except to a political treasurer or agent Corporation subscriptions may not be solicited at all and candidates contributions must be voluntary The purposes for which agents and treasurers may expend money are designated and include in general the holding of public meetings conducting headquarters and the dissemination of information All printed material must purport on its face to be printed by authority of the treasurer or agent and if published in a newspaper must be marked as an advertisement Candidates may pay for their personal expenses in traveling and circulating letters etc but other expenses must not exceed a fixed scale dependent upon the number of electors in their district Detailed statements of expense accounts must be filed by political treasurers and agents and by candidates Failure to do so is penalized by fines not exceeding 1000 for political treas urers and agents and 2000 for candidates Imprisonment for not longer than one year may be added to these penalties No person is to be deemed elected to any office who has failed to file the required statements Giving or receiving things of value to influence voters is penalized as a corrupt practice Judges and corporations may make no contributions Employers are forbidden to attempt to influence the votes of their employees through the post ing of notices or the dissemination of political literature Personation is also penalized Prosecutions for violation of the corrupt practice law may be instituted in the circuit court of any county in the district in which the candidate was voted for by the petition of any defeated candidate or by ten qualified voters Such action must be brought within thirty days Trial is to be without jury unless one party desires a jury to be judge of the facts If it be found that any candidate elected to any office in the state has been guilty of a corrupt practice through himself or his agents or through political committees acting in his behalf the judge shall certify that fact to the governor who must within five days declare the office vacant If the guilty candidate is a pres idential elector or congressman the judgment must be certified by the governor to the speaker of the house of representatives if aNOTES ON CURRENT LEGISLATION 239 state senator to the president of the senate and if a representative to the house of representatives of the General Assembly of Indiana The duty is also imposed upon the prosecuting attorney of each county to prosecute for violations of this act These three laws while they contribute little that is new to corrupt practice jurisprudence embrace provisions which have been used with considerable success elsewhere They may be expected to greatly decrease the contamination of elections in these states S GALE LOWRIE

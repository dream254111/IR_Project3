have learned with satisfaction tilc intention ot Government to direct in filture daily meteorological observa tions to be made at sea in correspondence with the plan adopted by the Government of the United States on the suggestion of Lieut Maury and to take such further steps in reterence to the Inercantile marine of Great Britain as Inay be best suited to stimulate and encourage the masters of British mer chant ships to tale interest in investigations by which the times of passage lets een dierent part3 have already in many instances beerl materially shortened and whih may lead to other restllts ot the greatest importance to lractTcal navigation  The British Association entirely concurs in the opinion that to make the observations thus contemplated serviceable to the purposes for uhich they are designel it will be necessary to make provision tor their coordination and tor deriving from them the instruction which they may be capable of yieldin for the advantaze of Navigation and for the benefit ot 23cience Te next meetiny of the British Association will be held at Liverpool

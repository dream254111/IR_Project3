AEMULANTIBUS BY MR GEORGE EDWARDS LIBRARIAN TO THE COL LEGE OF PHYSICIANS THREE OF THESE CROCODILES WERE SENT OVER FROM BENGAL ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO TO THE LATE DR MEAD PHYSICIAN IN ORDI NARY TO THE KING TWO OF WHICH HE PRESERVED IN HIS OWN COLLECTION AND PRESENTED THE THIRD TO THE LATE CURIOUS MRS KENNON AND SINCE THE DECEASE OF THESE EMINENTLY WORTHY PERSONS THEY ARE ALL BECOME THE PROPERTY OF MR JAMES LEMAN OF LONDON WHO HAS OBLIGED ME WITH THE USE OF ONE OF THEM TO PRO DUCE TOGETHER WITH THIS ACCOUNT TO THE INSPECTION OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY WHICH IS THE SUBJECT HERE LAID BEFORE YOU AND OF WHICH I PRESENT THE SOCIETY WITH A FIGURE JUST OF THESIZE AND FORM IT APPEARED IN WHEN TAKEN OUT OF THE SPIRITS TAB XXIX I SUPPOSE THIS NOT TO HAVE BEEN MANY DAYS EXCLUDED FROM IT EGG WHEN TAKEN MY REASON FOR THIS CONJECTURE IS BECAUSE THE NAILS OR CLAWS ON THE OUTER TOES DO NOT YET APPEAR WHICH I SUPPOSE MAY BE INCONVENIENT OR AT LEAST USELESS WHILE IT IS INCLOSED IN THE EGG WHICH BY ITS STRUGGLES MIGHT TEAR ITS MEMBRANOUS COVERING BEFORE 4 M 2 THE READ MAY 6 1756640 THE PROPER TIME OF ITS EXCLUSION A YOUNG ALLEGATOR OR CROCODILE FROM NORTH AMERICA HERE LAID BEFORE YOU BY WAY OF COMPARISON HAS PART OF ITS NAILS WANTING ON ITS TOES JUST AS THE ABOVE DESCRIBED WANTS THEM THOUGH IN A LARGE DRIED ALLEGATOR NOW IN THE COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS ALL THE TOES ARE ARMED WITH STRONG CLAWS WHAT IS MOST EXTRAORDINARY IN THIS SPECIES AND DISTINGUISHES IT FROM ALL OTHER CROCODILES IS THE NARROWNESS OF THE BEAK OR CHAPS WHICH AP PEARS LIKE THE BILL OF THE BIRD WHICH WE CALL A GOOS ANDER MERGANSER IT HAS SMALL SHARP TEETH OF WHICH I SHALL SAY NO MORE AS I HAVE GIVEN THREE VERY EXACT VIEWS OF THE HEAD AND BEAK ANOTHER PARTICULARITY IS A POUCH OR OPEN PURSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE UNDER SIDE OF THE BELLY WHICH SEEMS TO BE NATURALLY FORMED WITH ROUND LIPS AND A HOLLOW WITH IN PERHAPS TO RECEIVE ITS YOUNG IN TIMES OF DANGER AS WE FIND IT IN AN AMERICAN ANIMAL CALL AN OPOSSUM AS I HAVE NO PRETENSIONS TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF ANA TOMY I ASKED THE FAVOUR OF MY OBLIGING AND CURIOUS FRIEND DR PARSONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY TO ASSIST ME WHO ACCORDING TO MY REQUEST EXAMINED IT AND GAVE IT AS HIS OPINION THAT THE OPENING IN THE BELLY WAS REALLY NATURAL IT HAVING NO APPEARANCE OF HAVING BEEN CUT OR TORN OPEN IN OTHER RESPECTS IT HATH ALL THE MARKS COMMON TO ALLEGATORS AND CROCODILES VIZ A PARTICULAR STRONG SQUARE SCALINESS ON THE BACK WHICH IN THE YOUNG ONES APPEAR DISTINCT AND REGULAR BUT IN THE OLDER ONES LOSE THEIR DISTINCT FORM AND BECOME KNOBBED AND ROUGH LIKE THE BARK OF AN OLD TREE AND IN HAVING SMALL ROUND AND OVAL SCALES ON THEIR SIDES WHICH IN THE YOUNG ONES ARE NO BIGGER THAN RAPE641 RAPE SEEDS AND THE BELLY IS SCALED TO APPEARANCE A LITTLE LIKE THE LAYING OF BRICKS IN A BUILDING IT HAS FINS ON THE OUTSIDES OF ITS FORE AND HINDER LEGS AS OTHER CROCODILES HAVE IT HAS ALSO A GREAT DISTINGUISH ING MARK OF THE CROCODILE KIND VIZ TWO ROWS OF FINS ON THE UPPERSIDE OF THE TAIL WHICH BEGIN INSENSIBLY SMALL AT THE SETTING ON OF THE TAIL AND INCREASE GRA DUALLY AS THEY ADVANCE TOWARD THE MIDDLE OF THE TAIL WHERE THEY BECOME ONE ROW AND SO CONTINUE TO THE END THE TAIL IS ROUNDISH AT ITS BEGINNING BUT FROM THE MIDDLE WHERE THE TWO ROWS OF FINS BECOME ONE IT IS FLAT LIKE AN OAR THE FOUR FEET HAVE EACH OF THEM FIVE TOES THE HINDER FEET HAVE ONLY FOUR WHICH IS ALSO A MARK OF THE CROCODILE ALL THE LESSER LIZARDS THAT I HAVE OBSERVED HAVING FIVE TOES ON EACH OF THEIR HINDER FEET IN THE FORE AND HINDER FEET THE THIRD AND FOURTH TOES ONLY ARE WEBBED TOGETHER THE EYES ARE VERY PROMINENT AND SEEM TO BE CONTRIVED THAT THEY MAY BE CARRIED ABOVE THE WATER WHILE THE REST OF THE ANIMAL IS WHOLLY UNDER WATER IN ORDER AS I SUPPOSE TO WATCH ITS PREY ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER OR ON THE BANKS AND SHORES OF RIVERS THE HEAD IS COVERED WITH SEVERAL LARGE SCALES THE BEAK IS FINELY CREASED TRANSVERSELY AS THE INGRAVING IN THE FIGURE SHEWETH AS I HAVE BEEN VERY EXACT IN MY FIGURE WHICH WAS WORKED ON THE COPPER PLATE IM MEDIATELY FROM NATURE BY MY OWN HAND AND IN SEVE RAL DIFFERENT VIEWS IT WILL EXPRESS MORE THAN CAN EASILY BE CONVEYED BY WORDS IT APPEARED IN THE SPIRITS ALL OVER OF A YELLOWISH OLIVE COLOUR THE UNDER SIDE LIGHTER THAN THE UPPER THE UPPER SIDE HAVING SOME DUSKY MARKS AND SPOTS AS REPRESENTED IN THE PRINT I DO NOT KNOW THAT THIS SPECIES HATH YET BEEN 3642 BEEN FIGURED OR TAKEN NOTICE OF BY ANY AUTHOR WHICH IS TO ME A WONDER SINCE OUR INDIA COMPANY HAVE BEEN SO LONG SETTLED AT BENGAL AND THIS I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE WHEN AT FULL GROWTH TO BE NEAR IF NOT QUITE AS BIG AS THE COMMON CROCODILE COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS LONDON MAY 6 1756

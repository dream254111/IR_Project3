PHOTOS BY THE AUTHOR T ETON COUNTY lies in the northern half of Montana and considerably west of the center of the state its northern border formed by the Cana dian boundary and its western by the continental divide Although in the western half of Montana its birdlife is more nearly like that of the eastMay 1914 BIRDS OF NORTHERN MONTANA 125 ern part of the state due to the fact that along the northern border the eastern prairie region extends farther westward than elsewhere and in fact reaches the eastern base of the mountains forming the continental divide I have in cluded with Teton County that portion of Lewis and Clark County that lies in the drainage of the Sun River see fig 39 The southern boundary of Teton County is formed by the North Fork of the Sun River but since my ob servations covered both sides of the river and the character of the country is essentially the same on both sides I have made the divide between the drain ages of the Sun and Dearborn rivers the southern boundary of the region stu died This divide forms a natural division between different regions of the state the character of the country being markedly different on the two sides of it In studying the distribution and occurrence of the birds of this region it may be considered in two main parts the prairies and the mountains The Y  Iih rr  nrL  Lr  1 IL cl  r a I d aYIEb  iih i Fig 39 VIEW IN THE CANADIAN ZONE ON THE SUN RIVER LEWIS AND CLARK COUNTY MONTANA prairies occupy the eastern portion and cover considerably more than half of the total area They lie entirely within the Transition zone and their altitude varies from 3500 to 4500 feet They consist of open grass land rolling hills and flattopped benches steepsided buttes and broad valleys watered by streams that are bordered by cottonwood groves and willow thickets Alka line ponds and lakes are quite frequent in fact very numerous toward the westward along the edge of the lower mountain slopes The mountains occupy a comparatively narrow strip through the western part of the counties They embrace the headwaters of the Sun Teton and Two Medicine rivers and Birch Creek see fig 40 They lie in the Transition Canadian Hudsonian and Alpine zones and range from 4000 to 9500 feet in altitude These mountains are extremely rough consisting of numerous lime stone ridges with precipitous sides In many places most of the timber has126 THE CONDOR Vol XVI been destroyed by repeated fires but in other parts particularly about the headwaters of the Sun River there are extensive forests of evergreen trees In the Transition zone the principal trees are the Limber Pine Pinus flexilis and the Douglas Fir Pseudotsuga taxifolia The first forms rather extensive but open forests of crooked and stunted trees along the eastern bor der of the mountains The latter occurs on north slopes and along streams and extends up into the Canadian zone The most extensive mountain forests lie in the Canadian zone The principal trees in these forests are the Douglas Fir Lodgepole Pine Pinus murrayana and Engelmann Spruce Picea engel manni In the Hudsonian zone most of these species occur as stunted trees and with them are also the Whitebark Pine Pinus albicaulis Alpine Fir Abies lasiocarpa and Mountain Larch Larix lyalli The observations in this list were made by myself during a period from June 21 1911 to March 3 1913 during which time I was assigned to work on the Lewis and Clark National Forest Most of the observations in the prairie region were made in the vicinity of Choteau a small but growing prairie town the county seat of Teton County The altitude there is about 3800 feet Southeast of Choteau are two conspicuous buttes known as Rattlesnake and Priest buttes which rise to a height of 4500 feet At the foot of Priest Butte lies a group of three alkaline lakes known as the Priest Butte Lakes see fig 41 One of these is of considerable size and all of them attract numerous water birds particularly during the migrations Another point of interest within this region is the Willow Creek Bird Reservation an area set aside by the government originally in the interests of the Reclamation Service but now also as a bird reservation This area which is in the prairie region lies near the town of Augusta I have not had oppor tunity to visit it during the breeding season but have seen numerous water birds there during migrations It contains one large lake which is frequented by many species of ducks Snow Geese and Whistling Swans The birds recognize the protection afforded by this area and flock there in preference to nearby areas that are otherwise similar This area will be of great value in preserving such breeding species of this region as the Curlew Avocet and various species of ducks all of which are becoming less abundant as the set tlement of the region advances My observations in Teton County were largely confined to the southern portion It is quite probable that the county will be divided in the near future and the northern portion given some other name In that case the observa tions in this list except those from the vicinity of Lubec and the Two Medi cine River will still apply to Teton County The county at present includes that portion of the Glacier National Park which lies east of the continental divide Some previous ornithological work has been done there by Mr George Bird Grinnell and the results published in early numbers of Forest and Stream I have been unable however to obtain access to these publications so am not aware of just what they contain I believe that work has also been done in this region by the Biological Survey but most of the records are unpublished in previous publications on birds in this region I have spelled the name of the county seat of Teton County as Chouteau rather than Choteau Both spellings have been used commonly and the first adopted by the postoffice authorities Since my publication however the town has been incorporated and Choteau has been officially adopted Unless otherwise stated migration dates in this list were obtained at Choteau or in the immediate vicinityMay 1914 BIRDS OF NORTHERN

over in consider able numbers at night The call of this bird may be heard late at night com ing from overhead through September and in early October Dendragapus obscurus richardsoni Richardson Grouse Abundant resi dent throughout the mountains Breeds on the grass slopes of the upper Tran sition and lower Canadian zones Broods of young are very common in such places all summer feeding 4ery largely on grasshoppers About the middle of September when the first snowstorms come the grouse move up the moun tains here they winter along the ridges of the upper Canadian and HudsonianMay 1914 BIRDS OF NORTHERN MONTANA 131 zones feeding on bearberries and juniper or on pine and fir needles when the berries are covered with snow They return to the lower slopes again when the breeding season commences about the middle of May Canachites franklini Franklin Grouse Permanent resident in the moun tains occurring in the thick dense spruce forests along the mountain streams and in the bottoms of gulches Said to be less common now than formerly Bonasa umbellus umbelloides Gray Ruffed Grouse Permanent resident in the mountains between altitudes of 4500 and 6000 feet Inhabits the wil low and cottonwood thickets of the lower mountain streams All the birds I have observed closely in this region are B u umbelloides while those of more southern Montana are B it togata Lagopus leucurus leucurus Whitetailed Ptarmigan Permanent resi dent in the Alpine zone along the higher ridges Only found on the more re mote ridges along or near the continental divide Pedioecetes phasianel lus campestris Prairie Sharptailed Grouse Per manent resident of the prai ries The birds begin nest ing in late May when the cooing sound which accom panies the chicken dance may be heard any evening The first young are usually seen early in July In win ter the birds gather in large flocks in the thickets feed ing largely on buffalober ries and wild rose hips In spring and fall they frequent alfalfa fields and eat the alfalfa leaves Zenaidura macroura marginella W e s t e r n Mourning Dove Summer N 131  4  Fig 42 NEST AND EGGS OF THE MALLARD resident Much less common than in southern Montana I found nests with eggs in July Migration date May 19 1912 Circus hudsonius Marsh Hawk Common summer resident The most abundant hawk in the prairie portion of the region An account of the nest ing of this bird in this region has been published see CONDOR XV 1913 pp 195204 Migration date April 7 1912 Accipiter velox Sharpshinned Hawk Summer resident in the moun tains Nests commonly in aspen groves and spruce thickets Young are usually not out of the nest till late August Migration dates May 8 1912 September 8 1911 and September 13 1912 Accipiter cooperi Cooper Hawk Summer resident Usually seen only in the mountains but I observed one in a cottonwood grove near Choteau July 8 and 9 1912132 THE CONDOR Vol XVI Astur atricapillus atricapillus Goshawk I observed a pair of these birds June 29 1911 in a heavy stand of spruce timber on Beaver Creek in the Sun River country I believe they had a nest in the vicinity I saw another bird on the West Fork of the Sun River September 3 1912 Buteo borealis calurus Western Redtail Common summer resident The commonest hawk in the mountains but occurs rarely on the prairies Nests occasionally in large firs but much more frequently on rocky ledges on the faces of steep cliffs Buteo swainsoni Swainson Hawk Common summer resident of the prairies nesting in cottonwood groves Also found along the base of the mountains where it nests in the limber pines I found one nest placed in a willow bush but six feet from the ground Nesting begins late in May Mi gration dates May 1 1912 and September 27 1911 Archibuteo lagopus sanctijohannis Roughlegged Hawk I observed this hawk but once January 8 1912 Archibuteo ferrugineus Ferruginous Roughleg Summer resident not common A pair nest each year on the precipitous face of Priest Butte Nest ing begins early in May and I was iiformed that this nest contained eggs and newlyhatched young on June 2 1912 Aquila chrysaetos Golden Eagle Permanent resident Most common along the bases of the mountains Haliaeetus leucocephalus alascanus Northern Bald Eagle Rare I have seen it only in March and November when there seems to be a migration of this species along the foothills of the mountains I have listed it as the sub species alascanus on the strength of a mounted specimen in the Forest Service office at Choteau This is a bird in juvenal plumage It measures wing 275 inches tail 160 inches and tarsus 44 inches measurements certainly large enough to class it with the northern subspecies This bird came from a little outside this region having been secured by Mr W H Daugs of the For est Service on the South Fork of the Flathead River west of the continental divide Falco rusticolus rusticolus Gray Gyrfalcon I observed a bird of this species very closely at Collins January 8 1912 Falco mexicanus Prairie Falcon Summer resident in the prairie re gion A pair nested on the side of Rattlesnake Butte in 1912 Falco peregrinus anatum Duck Hawk Rare summer resident I saw a pair near the cliffs on Priest Butte several times in the summer of 1911 and believe that they nested there They were not present in 1912 however Falco sparverius phalaena Desert Sparrow Hawk Summer resident in the prairie region I found a nest in an old flicker hole in a cottonwood near Choteau in 1912 The young from this nest were on the wing July 14 This hawk is less common here than in southern Montana Migration dates May 19 1912 and September 28 1911 Pandion haliaetus carolinensis Osprey Observed once along the Teton River near Choteau May 19 1912 Asio flammeus Shorteared Owl Common summer resident of the prai ries I believe that at least four pairs nested within a radius of two miles of Choteau in 1912 see CONDOR XV 1913 pp 121125 Bubo virginianus pallescens Western Horned Owl Permanent residentMay 1914 BIRDS OF NORTHERN MONTANA 133 in the prairies nesting in cottonwood groves I observed young near Choteau well able to fly in late May 1912 Nyctea nyctea Snowy Owl Occasional winter visitor on the prairies Surnia ulula caparoch Hawk Owl One seen near Summit in firekilled pine timber November 8 1912 Glaucidium gnoma pinicola Rocky Mountain Pygmy Owl Permanent resident Observed frequently in different parts of the mountains but most commonly in fir timber on Beaver Creek a tributary of the Sun River Ceryle alcyon alcyon Belted Kingfisher Common summer resident along streams both in the prairies and mountains Migration dates April 9 1912 and September 27 1912 Dryobates villosus monticola Rocky Mountain Hairy Woodpecker Per manent resident Found in winter and migrations in cottonwood groves along streams in the prairies Breeds in pine and fir forests in the mountains It is possible that the bird of this region is referable to leucomelas I secured no specimens but found a dead bird near Choteau late in March 1912 from which I saved a wing From the markings on this wing I believe that this bird was intermediate between monti cola and leucomelas Dryobates pubescens subspecies  Downy Woodpecker One bird seen near Choteau January 5 1913 Since this bird oc curred in winter and this species is certainly not com mon in this region in the breeding season I believe that it may belong to D p nelsoni In this connection I wish to call attention to a note of Bendires Life Hist N Amer Birds vol II p   9Li I 41 il ltti I rs IL 5Al 44 N4t N Fig 43 NEST AND EGGS OF AVOCET 56 made before this subspecies was described but which undoubtedly proves the occurrence of nelsoni in Montana in winter Picoides arcticus Arctic Threetoed Woodpecker Observed in consid erable numbers in firekilled timber on the South Fork of the Two Medicine River January 15 1912 Picoides americanus dorsalis Alpine Threetoed Woodpecker Ob served in considerable numbers with the above species at the same time and place A single bird seen in the same place March 30 1912 and one observed on Birch Creek June 2 1912 A large area on the Two Medicine River was burned over in the summer of 1910 The next year the bark of the firekilled trees was infested by a small beetle The presence of this beetle evidently accounted for the abundance of threetoed woodpeckers on this area in Janu ary No birds were seen there the following winter Melanerpes erythrocephalus Redheaded Woodpecker Rare summer resident One bird seen near Choteau July 16 1911 and a pair near Strabane June 5 1912134 TIlE CONDOR Vol XVI Asyndesmus lewisi Lewis Woodpecker Summer resident I have seen it only in the southern part of the region in cottonwood groves along the Sun River just outside the mountains Colaptes cafer collaris Redshafted Flicker Common summer resident Nests in cottonwood groves in the prairies and in the lower mountain canyons up to 5500 feet Most of the birds are hybrids but I have seen none in this region that were typical of the eastern species Migration date April 7 1912 Two birds wintered near Choteau in the winter of 191213 Chordeiles virginianus henryi Western Nighthawk Common summer resident both in prairies and in the mountains below 6000 feet Migration dates June 7 1912 August 28 1911 and August 29 1912 Selasphorus rufus Rufous Hummingbird Summer resident Not com mon but found most frequently along the foothills of the mountains Stellula calliope Calliope Hummingbird Summer resident of the moun tains Seen rarely I secured a male on Birch Creek June 2 1912 Tyrannus tyrannus Kingbird Abundant summer resident in the prai ries The Kingbirds in this region depart from their usual habit of nesting high and place their nests low down in young cottonwoods or buffaloberry bushes particularly those along the banks of streams The nest frequently overhangs the water In 1912 I found ten nests near Choteau no one of which was higher than eight feet from the ground and one of them was less than two feet from the water of the stream it overhung Migration dates May 23 1912 and August 22 1911 The first nests are built in this region about the middle of June The eggs take fourteen days to hatch and the young leave the nest when fourteen or fifteen days old so that they are first on the wing in the latter half of July Tyrannus verticalis Western Kingbird Rare summer resident in the prairies One pair nested near Choteau in 1912 Others seen on the Sun River near Augusta Migration dates May 28 1912 and August 18 1911 Sayornis sayus Say Phoebe Summer resident on the prairies Not common Nests on buildings or on rocks on the sides of buttes A nest of this species on a building in Choteau is said to have been occupied for the past sev enteen years When I first arrived in Choteau June 21 1911 there were six young in this nest that left the nest about July 4 The next year the owners returned April 28 sitting commenced on a set of seven eggs on May 23 the eggs all hatched on June 4 and the seven young were successfully reared and left the nest on June 23 A second brood was started and three eggs were laid by July 2 Nuttallornis borealis Olivesided Flycatcher Summer

usually the first sign of spring Migration dates March 10 1912 March 3 1913 Young are first seen on the wing in the latter half of June and again in August which leads me to believe that there are two broods one commencing early in May and the second in July Pica pica hudsonia Magpie Abundant permanent resident on the prairies nesting in cotton wood groves and willow thickets Occasionally found in

containing eggs on June 23 1912 Rhynchophanes mccow ni McCown Longspur Abundant summer resident on the prairies In some places on the flattopped prairie benches this is the only bird to be found Mi

Migration date April 30 1912138 THE CONDOR Vol XVI Ammodramus bairdi Baird Sparrow Observed in migrations Septem ber 4 1911 and May 23 1912 Possibly a summer resident A sparrow nested in the grass about the borders of alkaline ponds which I was unable to identify I heard the song which was unfamiliar to me frequently I am not acquainted with the song of the Baird Sparrow but believe it likely that it was this species Chondestes grammacus strigatus Western Lark Sparrow Seen once near Choteau July 18 1911 Zonotrichia leucophrys leucophrys Whitecrowned Sparrow Zonotrichia leucophrys gambeli Gambel Sparrow Apparently both of these birds are summer residents in the mountains and migrants in the prai ries I observed Z 1 leucophrys very closely on the Teton River in the summer of 1911 These birds were about one of the Ranger Stations and came to pick up oats in a corral where horses were fed They became so tame that they would almost eat out of my hand In June 1912 I secured specimens of Z 1 gambeli on Birch Creek Two varieties of songs from this species are to be heard in this region and I believe that they belong to the two different sub species The song which evidently belongs to gambeli is like that of leuco phrys but shorter with three or four of the terminal notes omitted I have never heard any but the longer song in southern Montana where I believe only leucophrys breeds Migration dates of birds seen in the prairies without at tempt to separate the two forms are October 1 1911 and May 8 to 28 1912 Spizella monticola ochracea Western Tree Sparrow Common winter visitor on the prairies Migration dates October 1 1911 and April 3 1912 Spizella passerina arizonae Western Chipping Sparrow Common sum mer resident of evergreen forests in the mountains Rarely a summer

Sparrow Abundant summer resident of the prairies nesting in patches of cinquefoil and buffaloberry bushes Mi gration date May 12 1912 Spizella breweri Brewer Sparrow Rare summer resident I observed a pair of these birds in a patch of buffaloberry bushes along the Teton River near Choteau several times in June and July 1912 Junco hyemalis hyemalis Slatecolored Junco Rare migrant on the praries Observed November 7 1912 near Choteau Junco hyemalis montanus Montana Junco Common summer resident in the mountains Rather rare migrant on the prairies Migration date April 2 1912 In this region the great variety of juncos so common in south ern Montana during migrations is lacking Probably most of the other forms breed farther to the westward and move that way as they go north thus en tirely avoiding this region Melospiza melodia montana Mountain Song Sparrow Rare summer resident in the mountains in willow thickets along streams Seen most fre quently in the southern part of the region which is probably about the north ern limit of its breeding range A migrant song sparrow was observed near Choteau May 8 1912 My attempt to secure this bird failed but I believe it probable that it belonged to another race perhaps M m juddi Melospiza lincolni lincolni Lincoln Sparrow Common summer residentMay 1914 BIRDS OF NORTHERN MONTANA 139 in the mountains nesting in willow thickets along

October 18 1911 The bird was in a dense aspen thicket and approached to within three or four feet of me Passerella iliaca schistacea Slatecolored Fox Sparrow Rare summer resident in the mountains nesting in dense willow thickets along streams This is evidently close to the northern limit of the breeding range on this side of the continental divide I observed the species most frequently on the

Montana these birds were very abundant in the year 1907140 THE CONDOR Vol XVI Piranga ludoviciana Western Tanager Common summer resident in the mountains Nests in fir forests Migration dates August 28 1911 on the Sun River and June 4 1912 on Birch Creek Petrochelidon lunifrons lunifrons Cliff Swallow Abundant summer resident of the prairies Nests commonly both on buildings and on the steep sides of buttes People in Choteau destroy their nests as fast as they are built believing that the birds carry bedbugs My observations seem to show that the birds will not nest on wooden buildings that are kept painted prefering either stone buildings or unpainted wooden ones Migration date June 7 1912 Hirundo erythrogastra Barn Swallow Summer resident on the prai ries Occurs regularly in small numbers but is not common Migration date June 7 1912 Tachycineta thalassina lepida Northern Violetgreen Swallow Summer resident in the mountain canyons Most common in the southern part of the region and rare northward These birds are known as Rock Swallows in this region Riparia riparia Bank Swallow Common summer resident in the prai rie region Colonies are very common along the steep clay banks of the rivers Migration date May 26 1912 Stelgidopteryx serripennis Roughwinged Swallow Common summer resident Nests in clay banks along the rivers usually as single scattered pairs but I have seen several pairs nesting in a colony with the above species Migration date May 22 1912 This swallow was fairly abundant for several days before the other species arrived Bombycilla garrula Bohemian Waxwing Common winter visitor both on the prairies and in the mountains being most abundant along the foothills of the mountains Occurs in the mountains rarely insummer and probably breeds see CONDOR XIV 1912

generally begins the middle of July but I found one nest at Choteau that was half built on June 28 and in which the four eggs were laid July 5 to 8 Lanius borealis Northern Shrike Winter visitant I found it rare in the winter of 191112 and saw none at all in 191213 From a few observa tions in other parts of the state I am inclined to think that these birds were rare all over the state in these two years Migration date October 16 1911 Lanius ludovicianus excubitorides Whiterumped Shrike Summer resi dent of the prairie region Quite common in the summer of 1911 but seen only once in 1912 This occurrence was at Choteau on April 9 when the bird had evidently just arrived My migration dates for this species in Montana are quite variable and lead me to believe that this is due to a wide difference in the migration dates of the two subspecies occurring in the state L 1 excubitorides evidently breeds only in valleys of the Transition zone below 4500 feet elevation arriving early in April as shown by the above date and by another record April 9 1911 at Helena at an elevation of about 4000 feet The other subspecies L 1 migrans is evidently a migrant only occurring in the upper Transition zone about 5000 feet elevation in May The evidence to show this is certain only in the case of a bird taken at Anaconda May 14May 1914 BIRDS OF NORTHERN MONTANA 141 1911 CONDOR XIV 1912 p

October 1 1911 Anthus spraguei Sprague Pipit Common summer resident of the prai ries Appears to prefer neither the dry prairie benches nor the rich grass meadows but occurs about the borders of ponds or in hollow depressions in the prairie where the soil is moist but too alkaline to be clothed with a tall thick growth of grasses The bird itself is very difficult to see and observe but the song is one of the commonest sounds on certain parts of the prairies in June and July Migration date May 23 1912 Cinclus mexicanus unicolor Dipper Permanent resident on mountain streams Occurs in the vicinity of waterfalls in summer but winters in places where the fall of the stream is not so steep and yet where the current is swift enough to keep open water all winter Begins nesting late in May Dumetella

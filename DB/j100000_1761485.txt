results science can be taught to quite young children by a teacher who goes from school to school and has his apparatus carried around with him There is something very amusing to an Ameriicanit would be hard to say exactly why  in the description given in Nature of a  strong youth dragging through the city his  handcart laden with apparatus and when he reaches a school unpacking it spreading it out on a table and retiring at the moment the demonstrator steps in But after enjoying the local color of the picture it may be well to ask ourselves whether the plan is not a good one and deserving of imitation in our own public schools In this country no form of scienceteaching is introduced as a general thing below the high school The Birmingham course is given to children of from ten to thirteen years of age One lesson fort nightly of about forty minutes duration is given in the fifth and higher standards in each school Between the visits of the science demonstrator at least one lesson is given to the class by the teachers of each school as a rule by a teacher who was present at the de monstrators lesson and who took full notes of it and a written examination in the subject matter of the lesson is also held Most of the apparatus is of the simplest form and so made that it can be taken to pieces and examined in detail by the children Much of it Mr Harrison has himself designed and had made for the purpose His plan is to prepare work ingmodels pictures and diagrams of pumps for instance to have the appalatus arranged on the table and to draw from the boys what they know about pumps before telling them any thilng He then shows them the working of the machine explains its principle and re minds them of other instances in which they have seen the same principle at work Before he comes to them again the regular teacher goes over the ground once more and then the boys write out what they have learned and VOL V No 114 make drawings of the objects fiomn memory Some of the papers which we have seen showed a remarkable degree of intelligent comprehen sion and one of the most interesting eases in the education department of the London health exhibition was that which contained a set of mechanical apparatus made by the boys at home with no better tool than a jackknife The course extends over three years For the last year the syllabus covers the mechan ical powers liquid pressure the parallelogram of forces and the parallelogram of velocities The second year is devoted to food and to the warming cleaning and ventilation of the dwelling The topics discussed in the eighteen lectures of the first year are not those which we should expect to find in a course on me chanics The second lecture for instance is devoted to the human body its structure and the use of the microscope and on succeeding days are discussed oxygen hydrogen nitro gen amyloids albutminoids the composition of milk eggs etc wool as a material for clothing hard and soft water the skin and soap and soda There are two distinct features in the Bir mingham plan whose merits need to be dis cussed separately  teaching science by means of a single teacher and set of appliances for several schools and teaching it to very young children With regard to the latter question we shall have something to say at another time but whatever one may think about teasing children ten years old with such hard things as amyloids and albuminoids there is no doubt that if it is to be done at all it can be done best by a peripatetic teacher Good scienceteachers do not grow on every bush and when one has been found it is a pity not to use him with as great economy as possible Few of the teachers now in grammarschoois have received any scientific instruction still less have they been able to acquire the meth ods which are far more important than the facts The attempt to teach the teachers en masse would probably not be very successful There are comparatively few grown people who can go back to the childs delight in askingSCIENCE questions of the things themselves They do not care to pull the doll or the toy to pieces they would rather be told what it is made of than take the trouble to examine it The ele ment of curiosity seems to have been educated out of them and their only idea of teaching elementary science is to give the children as many facts as possible about things which they know only by their definitions Until then the present happy generation of children has grown up and become ready to teach science by scientific methods it seems evident that the plan of itinerant teaching has much to commend it It is a plan moreover whose advantages ought not to be confined to the grammarschools Instead of putting a single overworked teacher in charge of all possible sciences in a high school specialists might be found who would go from school to school and carry with them an enthusiasm which it is impossible to feel for a very wide range of subjects The Johns Hopkins university has already tested the excellence of the method for higher schools of learning It is not impossi ble that the smaller colleges would gain by it if they were to adopt the plan of making occa sional exchanges among their professors In no other way could they so easily secure the specialization which is necessary for the best teaching AN ESTIMATE OF GENERAL GORDONS SCIENTIFIC CHARA CTERISTICS IN our eagerness to honor a hero there is some danger that Gordons fame may suffer temporary injury and that his character and the nature of his deeds may be seriously mis understood The popular notion seems to be that he lived in a state of mystical exaltation and won his strange successes by powers and processes incomprehensible if not supernatu ral Recent writing about him has dwelt so particularly upon his religious fervor and much of it has been so intemperate and in discriminating that it is not strange that some shallow pamphleteers should have classed him with the prophets He was a hero Besides that he was a highly educated disciplined and painstaking officer He inherited military talent and love for his profession from gen erations of soldiers and he was trained in that 289 thoroughly scientific corps the Royal engi neers For the first three years of his service under the khedive he kept careful itineraries of all his marches and being a fine topog rapher he made solid contributions to our knowledge of the geography of the upper Nile country I have before me a dozen sketch maps of the equatorial country drawn by his own hand with uncommon skill IIe was fond of illustrating his letters and memoranda of instructions with geographical and topographi cal sketches He was minutely careful in his arrangements for solidifying and extending his communications and positions fertile and in genious in applying his knowledge If we ever learn the details of his defence of Khar tum we shall probably be as much astonished by its mechanical side as by its higher intel lectual and moral qualities From the beginning of his career before Stevastopol He had a personal knowledge of the enemys movements such as no other officer attained His knowledge of the peo ple of the Sudan of their sheiks and fakirs and of the Egyptian officers serving there was remarkable He had great capacity for detail but his mental processes were so rapid and his perceptions so keen that he was often thought illogical by those who could not keep up with him IHe was often misjudged too because he would not bother to explain all his steps Far from being a mystic he was wide awake and practical In Africa and in China he was constantly vigilant in keeping his powder dry The clothes food pay and sanitary conditions of his soldiers were diligently watched over The infirmities of temper of his subordinates were well understood and provided for His campaign in China may well be studied as a shining example of skilfully planned warfare and his scheme for the better government of the Sudan involved twelve years of logical and systematic development before its effect could be fully felt Let no one think that Gordon mounted his camel and rode into the desert or seized his stick and led his rascals up to the mouths of the Chinese cannon with a magnificent but blind faith He was a laborious student of the problem in hand he had a keen intelligence his judgment was prompt and accurate he was patient and farseeing his will was indomi table but above all he had eliminated himself entirely from his problem This made Gordon great He could see what other men could not and do what they dared not because he was as unselfish as a human being can be H G PROuT APRIe 10 1885

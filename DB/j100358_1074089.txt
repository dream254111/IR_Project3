j100358,The School Review,1074089,First Year English in the High School,i244451,First Year English in the High School First Year English in the High School The question of curriculum of study for the public schools seems doomed always to have  the wolf on this side the dog on that The people are pulling one way demanding that their children shall have a mixture of the useful and the ornamental and caring little for rules of logical order or theories of phil osophic method while the higher institutions are pulling in the opposite direction insisting that the aim of the lower schools shall be to meet the conditions of admission within their doors The matteroffact business man calls the public schools to an ac count if his son lacks his own facility and accuracy in measur ing wood or in writing and computing the interest on a promissory note the mother surrounded by the refining influences of wealth does not understand why her daughter is not allowed to pursue the study of French in the grammar school the clergyman preaches against the superficiality of public school training if a girl in his Sunday School happens not to know where Antioch is and the college professor cares only that the freshmans knowledge meet the exactions of his particular examinations The business man gives but little credit to the schools for the general discipline they afford which makes it possible for the young graduate by a little special attention to do anything of a business nature he is likely to be called upon to do the clergyman from the charac ter of his study so familiar with biblical geography fails to con sider the necessary scope of a modern childs knowledge of places and overlooks the fact that the girl referred to would pass a better general examination in the subject of geography than he himself could pass and the professor seems not to be aware that there are other educational interests as important as those in which he is specially concerned The golden rule for the teacher is Consider the rights of others your department of instruction is not the only one There is a tendency in meetings like this to discuss principles and abstractions rather than what relates to practice In this paper an attempt is made to treat in a plain manner and briefly a simple matter of practical bearing which is just now receiving considerable attention from both teachers and the public The question of giving the study of English greater prominence I5The School Review in our secondary courses of study has already passed through the necessary stage of agitation and it is now in order to examine a no less important phasehow this is to be done In the ardor which accompanies new movements there is dan ger of claiming too much of prerogative for the reform aimed at sometimes even to ignoring the rights of other things In a well planned course of study there are other branches just as dear to us as English and it should be our aim to make the introduction into this course of anything new as little prejudicial to what is already legitimately there as possible No satisfactory agreement has yet been reached as to what con stitutes English Those most enthusiastic in urging its claims to greater prominence in our scheme of popular education are wide apart in their respective estimates of what its essentials are In our attempt to find in the high school at least one year where this subject shall have a permanent place as a daily recitation none of its salient features will be overlooked By first year English in the high school is meant composition literature and oral reading including whatever may be implied by these This would mean elementary rhetoric with some attention to such matters as etymology punctuation figures of speech style and diction the cultivation of a taste for classic literature by the study of a few of the best American authors and the lay ing of the foundation of graceful and intelligent oral reading with special attention to orthoepy physical posture elocution and intelligent interpretation of thought The teaching of such English as this is not to require the ser vices of an enthusiast or a prodigy for an instructor one whose success is dependent upon his being swept along by a tide of in spiration but it is to be done by ordinary teachers working within the usual limitations of their profession If as is usually the case these teachers have not been trained for the work they must learn to do by doing as is often the case with the best teachers of other subjects Until recently English as here outlined was treated in the high school as something incidental to receive attention once a week or even less frequently like music drawing or current topics If rhetoric was taught as a regular daily classroom sub ject it was for the benefit of only a few What we are claiming in this paper is that all high school students of whatever course i6First Year English in the High School should have English as a first year study and that it have the same amount of time and attention daily that is now given to al gebra or Latin A few years ago complaints began to be made generally that the history of our own country was too much neglected in the public schools Previously the public conscience had tried to quiet itself with the baseless theory that the child obtains by general reading all that is desirable in this direction It was found in fact that there is no such amount of general reading of history as had been claimed that the young rarely read history at all of their own accord The usual period of preliminary agi tation was passed through the public was at length sufficiently aroused in regard to the matter a permanent place for this im portant branch of study was found in the grammar school and in consequence the graduates from our grammar schools are now well informed about American History Although a single year of English can accomplish but little when compared with the re sults of a years study of American History it would be a most significant little to be felt appreciably ever after To make it worth the while as has been said already English must be taught somewhere in the course with the same insistence upon regular class room work as is the case with geometry All things considered the earlier this teaching comes in the high school the better If placed in the first year nearly three times as many would receive its benefits as would be the case if de ferred until senior year and it would make possible a greater degree of success with the subsequent incidental rhetorical work of the school Moreover the influence of this first years disci pline in English would be felt to advantage everywhere in the students later career Teachers of higher classes would then oftener experience satisfaction in finding boys and girls some what trained to write and punctuate to appreciate literary ex cellence and to give pleasure instead of pain when called upon to read or recite orally Fewer persons are fitted to teach English than almost any other important branch of study As a rule young teachers are unwilling to take it as they have not been sufficiently instructed in it themselves As soon however as English shall be taught daily in the class room and to all the pupils of a given year just as Latin or algebra is taught there will be produced by a natural I7The School Review process competent teachers of English and it will become a favorite subject with them as by good right it ought to be Rousseau whose financial distress compelled him on one oc casion to affect a calling for which he was not qualified said  By continuing to teach music I insensibly gained some knowl edge of it There must be several teachers of first year English in a high school just as there must be several to teach algebra It would be well if all were to have the discipline that some teaching of English would give them Their good influence for English would then be felt all along the course as every subject affords more or less opportunity for it Teachers of other branches too commonly decline to take notice of errors in English such as mistakes of orthoepy in translating and errors of punctuation in written exercises Fortunately we have quite lost confidence in the principle once held to some extent that for the writing of good English it is only necessary to get something to say and that then there will be no difficulty in saying it properly One needs to be trained in literary composition just as he must be trained in any thing else Only now and then a genius like Hawthorne can dispense with passing through the green age of apprentice ship as a writer You may have heard of the Bachelor of Arts who found it necessary to take a postgraduate course in spelling Almost any college graduate might consistently take such a course in English It is a common regret with educated men that they had not been stimulated in early life to write perse veringly until they had formed the taste for literary composition If emphasis is to be put upon either composition or the study of literature in first year classes it should be given to the former Brief compositions should be required daily or nearly so and at first no subject is too simple to be successfully employed It will be remembered that Swift could write elegantly about a broom stick Several of these brief compositions should be read aloud and criticised by the teacher before the class each day that all the members of the class may be benefited by the originality of each as well as by the criticisms that accompany the reading The compositions the teacher lacks time to read may often be assigned for correction to the most competent members of the class Nearly the whole question of teaching composition writ i8First Year English in the High School ing in the schools especially in its early stages is expressed in thisregular daily class exercise a part of which is to be the dis cussion by the teacher in the presence of the class of the work done By such daily contact with the individual student the teacher gets the surest revelation of the deficiencies of his class It is not to be expected that students so young as those enter ing the high school should pay much attention to style and in vention but rather to accurate and grammatical expression of commolnplace thought Literary composition is generally at the outset distasteful but if persevered in the student comes in time to have a liking for it and finds as often happens that an acquired taste is stronger than a natural one A good illustration of the utter helplessness of a beginner when set unaided to the task of writing a composi tion is the case of a bright girl of thirteen who chose Re ligion  as her subject and wrote as follows  There are a great many kinds of religion There is the Presbyterian religion the Episcopalian religion the Baptist religion the Roman Catholic religion the Unitarian religion the Universalist religion and the Methodist religion This list exhausted the church denomina tions in her own village but by enumerating others less familiar to her and not forgetting the Mormons she succeeded in reach ing the required minimum limit of fifty words and at length breathed freely in the consciousness of having achieved one of those terrible things called compositions The art of literary composition requires long and patient prac tice intelligence that comes only by study and mature judgment which nothing but time can fully develop A French writer of great distinction says  With whatever talent a man may be born the art of writing is not easily learned An experienced author was once asked if he would encourage young people in writing poetry  By all means he replied the poetry will of course be good for nothing but the practice will be most helpful to them in forming the habit of careful thinking and especially in giving them facility in diction which will be of real use in their less ambitious efforts at prose The advisability of using a textbook in teaching first year composition is not quite established This is a question to be de cided by the individual teacher While a few work best without oneprobably the majority would prefer to use one and possibly all would find it helpful if it were not too much relied upon I9The School Review The amount of literature that can be studied in one year by boys and girls who have just entered the high school especially when only a part of each daily recitation can be made available for it is not large and there is abundant material that may be profitably used for that purpose Many American authors could be readily suggested any one of whom whether poet or prose writer would suffice But the aim of the teacher so far as this feature of English is concerned should be to direct the student in such classic lines of reading as he is likely to follow persever ingly and voluntarily Experience seems to show that the only literature likely to meet these conditions is prose fiction As the study of literature in the classroom implies and necessitates much independent and voluntary reading by the pupil out of school the teacher is at once called upon to find for his ambitious youthful readers a sufficiency of real classic fiction attractive and pure and consequently such as he may safely and confidently recommend to them Such prose fiction as this is not abundant Hardly any classic of this nature is wholly free from impurities the best and most attractive in other respects often being the most vitiated To become satisfied of this let any one of you attempt to recommend to a girl of ravenous literary appetite unobjection able classic fiction sufficient to supply her for a single year Go to your own libraries and select the novels by the English mas ters which you can consistently recommend to her When it is stated that you are likely to begin by rejecting all of Thackeray Scott and Fielding the real difficulty of the case becomes plain It seems like sacrilege to expurgate the works of such authors as Sterm Victor Hugo and Bulwer to make them safe reading for the young but much may be said in favor of so doing A teacher with the true literary spirit in selecting reading for his pupils will naturally choose a classic if possible but as he must nine times out of ten select a story and finds nearly all the stories written by classical authors containing what it would be imprudent to place before the unsophisticated reader the neces sity for some process of expurgation with the best novels becomes apparent Even  Gulliver  has been successfully cleansed and made readable for the young Great stress is laid upon fiction because naturally the youthful taste is for stories and it is wise to indulge this taste if it can be done with what is strictly within the domain of literary art Probably twenty young people will 20First Year English in the High School ingly read fiction for every one who reads standard history or poetry of his own accord In a high school of five hundred it would be surprising if more than one were found who had read all of Wordsworth or one even who had read all of Bancrofts History of the United States This taste for history and poetry can be only moderately forced Time alone develops it I once knew a lawyer of decided literary taste who neglected to read Hudibras until he was quite advanced in years He said he had always known that it was a great poem because his cultivated father had early pointed it out to him as a book he would some day delight in For the successful taking up of some authors it makes a great difference at what place in his works one begins As an intro duction to Carlyle On Heroes might charm a reader who would find his French Revolution  hopelessly disgusting A young person might be pleased with the  Blithedale Romance who could see nothing of worth in the matchless introduction to the Scarlet Letter The teacher of wide reading should make a lasting impression upon these boys and girls of fifteen laying the foundation of what will later be a genuine literary culture The amount of knowledge actually acquired may not be large it will be like seed well sown to come to an unfailing fruition later Oral reading is included among tie essentials of first year En glish because it is desirable that no educated person should be without this accomplishment The extent to which our high schools neglect oral reading is deplorable The observation once made by a critical teacher after a week of visitation in city high schools will not surprise any onethat it was something of a consolation to know that the school she herself was connected with was not the only one that produced poor readers It is of quite common observation that the best read student is the worst reader just as it is often noticed that the man who leads his class writes a wretched hand Oral reading should form a part perhaps a subordinate part of first year English if for nothing else to form thoroughly the habit of a critical pronunciation of English Moreover good oral reading is an accomplishment to be coveted even if our cus tomary manner of educating holds it of but little value The pupil should be stimulated to practice oral reading daily 2IThe School Review at home thus supplementing the too meagre exercises of the school This plea for first year English in the high school is made upon the presumption that for the three renmaining years of the course the usual attention to incidental rhetorical work will be fully sus tained and to a much better purpose It is also believed that such an impulse will be given by this year of English in the way of literary culture as shall last to enrich a lifetime The plan hastily outlined in this paper has been tried for nearly two years in the Worcester High School and through the zeal and enlightened efforts of more than half a dozen teachers it has proved its worth It has been favored by intelligent enthusiasm an enthu siasm which has been fostered by the formation of a Fortnightly English Club in which there has been a free discussion of meth ods of procedure by means of which the originality of the indi vidual teacher could be freely copied and made available by all A careful and frequent inspection of the peculiar excellence of each teachers work by the principal has also made it possible for him to present at these fortnightly meetings the good results ob served Several of these teachers at the request of the principal recently prepared statements of their impressions as to what is most essential to be done in classes of first year English The substance of these impressions will now be presented as the con clusion of this paper ICONCERNING COMPOSITION WRITING Insist upon daily work in composition This is the allim portant feature Aim at developing the ability to think clearly and a facility in writing accuratenot necessarily elegantEnglish Insist upon correct paragraphing in all original work Let the pupils to some extent correct one anothers written work especially after the teacher has criticised as many papers as practicable before the class Require all corrected compositions to be rewritten in accord ance with suggestions of the teacher In marking them use a system of signs and place the charac ters in the margin leaving the pupil to find his errors for him self Teach clearness and unity and the common figures of speech 22First Year English in the High School Correct in the class a great variety of faulty sentences Require the learning of essential rules for punctuation and illustrate each by examples At first have the pupil write short compositions not continuous some of them on subjects that cannot be looked up Then require longer ones continuous from day to day upon books read outside the class IICONCERNING LITERATURE Require daily in the class a certain amount of study of some American author Require much reading in the class and in private what is read being frequently reported orally to the class Require committing to memory of beautiful selections Cultivate in the pupil the habit of looking carefully to the au thority of a statement See that the pupil acquires the ability to locate quickly the difficulty in the failure to understand any sentence Be sure to make a beginning in the cultivation of the literary taste and of a desire to read only the best Dictate as a part of the advance lesson questions which will compel the pupil to think out the answers The looking up of allusions is valuable but too much of such work wearies young pupils Make this subordinate to work which will stimulate their imagination and arouse a liking for the beautiful in literature and nature Give written lessons on the plot characters and figurative or obscure expressions after study of a selection IIICONCERNING ORA READING Devote some small portion of each recitation to oral reading and if possible have each pupil read aloud daily at home Require reading and reciting from the platform Give some attention to suffixes and prefixes and to the deriva tion of words Require the defining of new words to enlarge the pupils vo cabulary old words to make his knowledge accurate Have the pupil acquire the power to read at sight without blundering as well as secure a working knowledge of the strict meaning of words J G Wright Classical High School Worcester AMass 23

Dijrders accompanied with Pu tridity communicated in a Letter to JOHN MORGAN MD F R S and Profeffor of the Theory and Pra6ice of Phyfic at Philadelphia by WILLIAM WRIGHT M D of Trelawney in Jamaica A V IN G experienced the virtues of vegetable acid and marine falt when combined I beg leave to lay before you a few obfervations on the ufe of this fimple medicine in feveral difeafes It is my fincere wifh that it may prove as beneficial to mankind in general as it has been to many of my patients in this part of the country Take of limejuice or lemonjuice three ounces of ma rine falt as much as the acid will diffolve of any fimple diflilled cordial water one pint and of loaf fugar a fuf ficient quantity to fweeten it The dofe of this mixture muft be proportioned to the age fex and violence of the difeafe A wine glafsful may be given to adults every two four or fix hours By Geoffroys table it appears that the foffil alkali has a greater affinity with thle marine than with the vegeta ble acid However marine falt diffolves readily in the limejuice throws up a white fcum to the furface and on applying the ear near the veffel where the experiment is made a fmall hiffing may be heard fimilar to that when acidsM A RI N E S A L T 285 acids and alkalies are mixed It would feem probable that part of the marine falt is hereby decompofed That vegetable acids and marine falt are antifeptics has long been known but their effeas when mixed I appre hend to be but lately difcovered Without farther preface I fhall proceed to the particu lar difeafes in which they have been adminiflered pre pared as above 0F THE DYSENTERY The dyfentery is a very frequent diforder in this and other WeftIndia iflands and fometimes is epidemic par ticularly in the rainy feafons or when provifions are fcarce Amongfl other caufes of dyfenteries I have often known the eating of yams not arrived at maturity as alfo unripe alligator pears produce a bloody flux Dyfenteries commonly begin with frequent loofe ftools for a day or two attended with gripings by degrees the gripes grow more fevere nothing is voided by fool but a fmall quantity of mucus mixed with blood a tenefmus comes on and is exceedingly troublefome The appetite fails the patients are low fpirited and fuf fer a great profiration of ftrength The mouth and tongue are much furred and flimy and the tafle is like that of rotten butchers meat The defire of drink is fometimes exceffive but for the mod part very moderate The pulfe is very low feeble and undulating and rarely rifes fo high as to indicate the ufe of a lancet Such was the dyfentery in 1771 It proved fatal to many people both old and young though treated according to the mofi ap proved methods of cure and the lofs of feveral patients of mine convinced me of the neceffity of ufing antifep tics early in this difeafe A vomit feemed neceffary to clear the flomach and fome gentle purge to carry off part of the offending mat O o ter286 OF VEGETABLE ACID AND ter by fool But the aaion of thefe however mild often increafed the profiration of ftrength and rendered the fools fooner bloody Nor was opium of any real ufe A tea made of Simarouba and given to fome had a very falutary effeat whilfI if given to others it would by no means lye on their ftomachs From a confideration of the antifeptic quality of both the fal marin and of the vegetable acid I was induced to make trial of their effeas united in the manner above mention ed It aated like a charm and I find that from the ufe of it the frequency of fools gripes and tenefmus have foon worn off the ftools gradually become of a natural confiuence and quantity the fpirits ftrength and appetite returned and the patient has been reftored to perfea health in a very few days When the dyfentery was of long ftanding flarch cly fiers with a fmall portion of opium abated the tenefmus This medicine was equally ferviceable in diarrhceas D I A B E T E S As I had fucceeded fo well in the cure of dyfenteries I was determined to try its effeas in the diabetes fe veral opportunities foon offered but as thefe cafes were accompanied with other complaints efpecially with fevers of the remitting kind it will be proper firfI to fpeak of TH E REMITTENT FEVER This by far the mof common fever within the tropics is the leaft underftood and confequently for the moft part badly treated Strangers who walk much or work hard in the heat of the fun are more fubjeat to it than feafon ed Europeans or natives of the country Dr Cleghorns defcription of this fever is accurate and juff His method of cure fimple and eafy Every phy ficianMARINE SALT 287 fician who would wifh to praacice with fuccefs ifould be well acquainted with that valuable performance as alfo with what Dr Lind has faid on the fubjea It is then fufficient here to obferve that remittent fevers are often attended with diarrhoceas the diabetes and fome times with a copious difcharge of faliva as if mercury had been previoufly given In fuch circumflances I ne ver found the bark of fervice a few glaffes of the above mixture fully anfwered the intention not only by re moving thefe fymptoms but the fever at the fame time The Peruvian bark afterwards taken out of fome of the fame mixture effeatually fecured the patient from a re turn of this dangerous malady The mixture rarely aded as an afiringent in this or any other diforder But when this effea took place the in terpofition of fome lenient purge was deemed neceffary B E L L YA G H The bellyach with inflammatory fymptoms has fre quently occured in the courfe of Iny praalice they yield ed with difficulty to bleeding fmall dofes of emetic tar tar a mercurial pill repeated dofes of caftor oil diluting drinks with nitre fomentations and glyflers A copious difcharge of foetid excrement for the moft part gives im mediate relief I have obferved in many cafes after moft excruciating bellyachs that the ftools were liquid white fmall in quantity and very foetid The patients being worn out with pain grew difpondent did not care to fpeak fell into cold clammy fweats and were very refllefs They complained of an ill tafte in their mouths Their tongues were much furred Their breath offenfive and they had a great propenfity to vomit Formerly I attempted the relief of thofe threatening fymptoms with the bark in various forms as well as O o 2 claret28S OF VEGETABLE ACID AND claret and often faved my patient fometimes however I failed of fuccefs When fuch cafes fall now under my care I have immnediate recourfe to the antifeptic mixture nor have I been hitherto difappointed the ftools becom ing lefs frequent on the ufe of it and of a better confifi ence the cold fweats alfo difappear and the fpirits foon return together with an appetite for food THrE PUTRID SORE THROAT In June 1770 the putrid fore throat made confiderable lhavock amongft adults and children It attacked thofe of a lax habit who for a few days had flight headachs clhillinefs and heats alternately and an uneafinefs about their throats but not fo much as to hinder their fwal lowing On examination the mouth tongue and gums were foul and flimy the tonfils and uvula covered with white fpecks or floughs the breath was hot and offenfive the fkin felt hot and pungent to the touch the pulfe low and quick a diarrhoea often attended and the patients were in general much dejeated Antimonial wine with cordials and nourifhing diet fLc ceeded befl till the floughs or fpots were removed and feparated then the bark completed the cure When a diarrhoea accompanied this diforder I gave the mixture with fuccefs In all diforders where a gargle is neceffary I make ufe of the above mixture in preference to any other and I find it fpeedily cleanfes the tongue gums and fauces and fweetens the breath Where lemons or limes cannot be had vinegar or cremor tartar may be fubftituted in their room From what has been faid it is evident that the medi cine is poffeffed of confiderable antifeptic powers and its virtueMARINE SALT 289 virtue confifis in correing the peccant matter in the fRow mach and inteflinal canal All the difeafes in which I have given it had a putrid tendency I fhall be happy to hear of its fuccefs in your weftern hemifphere And am with efteem SI R Your moft humble fervant WILLIAM WRIGHT

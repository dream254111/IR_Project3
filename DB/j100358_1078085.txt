STOUTEMYER Kearney State Normal School Kearney Nebraska C THE EXPERIENCE OF THE TEACHING POPULATION The data to be found on the experience of the teaching popula tion are likewise meager and difficult to obtain Foght found that the average age of the rural teacher when beginning was 192 years which would preclude a very wide acquaintance with the social or intellectual environment and organization of the school Coffman states that every third man and every second woman engaged in teaching is under twentyfour years of age At least onehalf of the teachers of this country are little more than boys and girls to p 235 Not only is there this lack of maturity and lack of academic and professional preparation but the length of time spent in teaching is insufficient to get beyond the crude apprenticeship stage Coffman states that onefourth of the teachers have had only one year of experience and onehalf have had four years or less Coffman and Jessup concluded from their study of the teachers in the high schools of the North Central Association that the imma turity and lack of wide experience is shown by the fact that 13 per cent of these teachers have had one years experience or less 20 per cent have had two years 29 per cent have had three years experience or less In cities of 2500 and under onehalf had under three years 5000 and under onehalf less than four years the median experience ranges from three to eight years the more experienced being in the large cities i5 p 98 Shideler found that the percentage of teachers without experience varied indi rectly and the median years of experience varied directly with the size of the city Cities of 2500 or less had a much larger percentage of inexperienced teachers and the median years of experience was also much less than for larger cities 7 Coffman found that 77 336QUALIFICATIONS AND TENURE OF TEACHING POPULATION 337 per cent of the rural teachers 44 per cent of the town teachers 4465 per cent of the teachers in cities of 8ooo and over and 286 per cent in cities of iooooo and over teach five years or less i  Table IV presents the percentage of teachers with the number of years experience from the few states that furnished complete data From this table it may be noted that the central tendency is three years or less The black bars in Chart IV represent the percentage of teachers with three years experience or less and the figures in the unshaded part give the percentage with more than three years experience The average of the ten cases is 50 per cent with three years experience or less TABLE

measurement of teaching efficiency seems debatable Coffman holds that the greatest correlation between teaching and salary is at six years increase in salary after six years depends on factors other than experience i i Boyce maintains that teaching experi ence is less important than instructional skill studiousness or dis cipline However experience is an important factor in modifying teaching ability No elementaryschool teacher ranked first or second with less than five years of experience Among highschool teachers three years was the maximum for good teachers The average experience of elementaryschool teachers for the first and338 THE SCHOOL REVIEW second classes was 13 years and for the last two classes 8 5 years The average experience of highschool teachers for these correspond ing groups was ii 8 years and 639 years respectively  i6 p 156 According to Ruediger and Strayer The positive correlation between length of service and general merit is significant  No teacher ranked either first or second who had taught less than five years and only 4 per cent had taught more than 25 years  70 per cent of the teachers in the first rank 69 per cent of those in the second rank 40 per cent of those in the second lowest rank 30 per cent of those in the lowest rank had taught io years or more This indicates either that teachers keep on improving and passing on to higher rank for at least ten years or that the poorest teachers are gradually eliminated from the service Both factors play a part From the figures as a whole one may infer that a teacher in the grades reaches firstclass efficiency in about five years and that she maintains this efficiency for about 20 years and that after about 25 years of service she begins to decline I17 p 276 Thorndike holds that experience beyond the fourth or fifth year does not add greatly to the efficiency of the publicschool teacher Yet the premium on experience has the administrative advantage of encouraging the adoption of teaching as a permanent profession and of preventing frequent changes in the local teaching staff i8 p 41 D STANDARDS OF QUALIFICATION A comparison of the educational qualifications and tenure of our teaching population with that of some of the continental coun tries may aid us in understanding what ought to be our standard of qualification The rise of modern Germany to a vantage point in every field of activity in the worlds work is due to an effective school system and a thoroughly trained corps of schoolmasters Since the FrancoPrussian War France has reorganized her schools and trained her teachers for the rejuvenation of her national resources But we need not limit ourselves to these two world powers whose present prowess is the result of intensive education the two small nations Switzerland and Denmark afford ample material to prove that the real wealth of a nation lies not in the abundance of its natural resources but in a thrifty intelligent peopleQUALIFICATIONS AND TENURE OF TEACHING POPULATION 339 The following short citation from Professor Tates study of Swiss schools presents a sharp contrast to our teacher problem To an American one of the most impressive things connected with the Swiss school system is the stability of the teaching profession Threefourths of the teachers are men and practically all the teachers whom I met have engaged in the business as a lifework Teaching is rarely used as a stepping stone to some other profession There is very little shifting of the teaching force from place to place I spent ten days with a school inspector in Canton Berne He has 240 teachers under his supervision only 12 of them were teaching for the first year in the position which they held It is no unusual thing for a teacher to spend a long life in one position Admission to the teaching profession usually means graduation from the teachers seminary which requires for entering an eight or nineyear course offered in the common schools Teachers in the Gymnasium or the Middle Schools are usually university graduates After securing a certificate the Swiss teacher usually acts as a substitute for a year or two before finally being elected to a permanent position 19 p 27 Within the last halfcentury the decadent life of Denmark has been rejuvenated through the work of her schools with an efficient corps of teachers These teachers must have completed the course of study at the normal school or university before being appointed permanent teachers nongraduates may serve as apprentice teachers or assistants but not as regular teachers Out of 3812 men only 141 were nongraduates out of 1453 women 438 were nongraduates Out of a total of 5265 teachers 579 were non graduates This presents a sharp contrast to our condition Louisiana 191314 for example has approximately the same number of teachers 5658 yet 3264 are nongraduates A second contrast is with regard to the maturity of the Danish teachers Men teachers twentyfour years old or under constitute only 7 per cent of the total twentynine years old or under 20 per cent thirtynine years old or under 50 per cent that is half of the men teachers are forty years old or over mature men giving instruction to youth Women teachers twentyfour years old or under constitute 23 per cent twentynine years or under 48 per cent that is over half of the women teachers are more than thirty years old and are mature enough to be real leaders in the lifeproblems of youth see p 18 Since teaching is a permanent340 THE SCHOOL REVIEW profession the teachers feel that it is worth while to grow up with a place and seldom serve less than ten years in the same community Professional training and long tenures have been wrought with great influence on the rural community life The teachers are trained for country life and understand its needs They enter upon their tasks knowing that they have time to rear well and fundamentally This results in a community leadership which cannot be hoped from peripatetic teachers as is the case with teachers in most American school districts who remain in country schools for a term or two and use them as steppingstones to townschool teaching or other occupations Danish rural districts can count hundreds of teachers who would not exchange their positions for a firstclass inspectorship in Copenhagenall because they have been enabled by these fortunate arrange ments to hew out for themselves where they are an important niche in the educational life of the people 20 pp 13840 In our educational world there is a general acceptance of Schurmans assertions that we cannot teach what we do not know and that we cannot teach as much as we know for much is lost in the process of transition Hence it is generally agreed that a teacher should at least have completed the division of our educational system above that in which she would teach Thus it is not too much to demand that elementary teachers should have completed the high school Present opinion would add that pro fessional training in an approved teachertraining institution is a necessary part of an adequate preparation For highschool teachers it is not too much to demand that they have completed a college course or its equivalent Present opinion would add that they should have special training in the subjects they would teach together with instruction in the principles and practice of teaching A decade ago low standards and lack of uniformity according to Cubberly were the chief weaknesses of our system of certifica tion In more than half of the states of the Union it is possible to secure a teachers certificate and become a teacher with no other educational equipment than a knowledge of the commonschool subjectsthe merest rudiments of an education In about one fourth of the states no examination upon topics of a professional nature is required and the prospective teacher apparently is not expected to know anything as to the professional side of his or her calling 9 p 29 Just how much has been gained in these tenQUALIFICATIONS AND TENURE OF TEACHING POPULATION 341 years can only be conjectured however the following citations indicate a hopeful awakening After May i 1917 Idaho makes highschool graduation the standard requirement for all applicants for county certificates Since July i 1915 Iowa has required all applicants to have at least 12 weeks of normal training Kansas has been raising her standards until she now demands that after May I 1919 all teachers shall have at least a highschool preparation Excepting those with 18 months of successful experience or graduation from normal or college after August I 1915 all candidates in Minnesota must have completed a professional course of training for teaching but not to exceed 36 weeks 21 p 393 Missouri has been raising the standard until she requires all applicants after Sep tember I 1916 to have completed three years of an accredited high school or equivalent after September I 1918 such applicants must have completed four years or equivalent 21 p 397 In Ohio applicants for life certificates after January I 1915 shall possess the equivalent of one year in normal or college and after January i 1920 two years of such work not less than onefourth of which shall be in educational subjects Applicants for a oneyear or a threeyear elementary highschool or special certificate shall possess professional training not less than the following after January I 1915 not less than 6 weeks of classroom instruction in recog nized institution for training of teachers after January I 1916 12 weeks after January I 1917 18 weeks after January I 1918 24 weeks after January I 1919 30 weeks after January I 1920 I year Applicants for a oneyear or a threeyear elementary certificate shall have had at least I years training in approved high school and after January I 1920 2 years of such training Applicants for a oneyear or a threeyear highschool or special certificate shall have had at least I years training in approved high school after January I 1920 certificates of graduation from a firstclass high school 21 pp 4089 Oklahoma requires After January I 1916 no person shall receive a thirdgrade certificate who has not had an academic training equivalent to one year in an approved high school or at least io weeks in an approved professional school     no secondgrade certificate unless two years of highschool training or 20 weeks of professional training no firstgrade unless three years of highschool train ing or 36 weeks of professional training 21 p 4121342 THE SCHOOL REVIEW Wisconsin has made the following specific requirements On and after July I I915 no person who shall not have taught in a public school for at least one year shall be granted a country or city teachers cer tificate unless in addition to passing subjects required by law for such cer tificate he shall have completed the state commoncourse of study or its equivalent and shall have had two additional years of instruction in training one year of which or its equivalent shall have been devoted to teachers pro fessional studies but graduates of fouryear high schools not maintaining training course for teachers shall be required to have one year of training in professional studies such two years of additional training may be obtained at a state normal school a county training school or a free high school having an approved course of study for teachers     21 p 426 Since 1907 Indiana has required all beginners to have completed high school and have had 12 weeks professional training For the threecent wage 24 weeks of professional work is required and for the three and onehalf cent wage graduation from a teachertraining institution New York demands that no person shall be employed or licensed to teach in primary and grammar schools of any city or district employing a superintendent who has not had successful experience in teaching for at least three years or in lieu thereof has not completed prescribed course in a state normal school of the state passed an examination for and received a life state certificate completed an approved highschool course of not less than four years and in addition an approved professional course of not less than two years 21 p 4051 California has reached the highest standards in that elementary teachers must have highschool preparation and full normal train ing and highschool teachers must have completed college and have one year of graduate study onehalf of which is in educational work Our educational experience has taught us that low standards of certification and low wages go together As long as low standards of certification and low wages dominate our school system so long must short terms of service and constant recruiting of the ranks characterize our teaching population Many superintendents state that the bestprepared teachers remain longest in the pro fession though they offer no statistics showing the extent of this factor The history of education including the presentday sys tems of France and Prussia shows that the social status of the teacher varies directly with the professional training and fitness onQUALIFICATIONS AND TENURE OF TEACHING POPULATION 343 the part of the teacher and adequate return in salary and social esteem on the part of the state 22 The requirement of higher standards of certification is an educational problem the payment of a just wage is an economic problem depending for its solution on how much money the state will pay for professional training and fitness If the state required high qualifications and gave in return adequate salary and social esteem including tenure during efficiency and freedom from dread of dependency and old age teaching would become not only a stable but a learned profession for as the experi ence of France has demonstrated with small need for recruits training schools could then provide trained teachers for all vacancies E SUMMARY In the section on the educational qualifications of the teaching population the statistics showed that the educational unprepared ness of the teaching population was the most serious weakness in our school system Table I and Chart I give for the states repre sented 6o per cent with highschool preparation or less and 40 per cent with more than highschool preparation only a part of which can be called professional training Owing to recent legislation requiring professional training Wisconsin as presented in Table II and Chart II has a much higher proportion of teachers with more or less professional training Chart V presents the data on the educational qualifications tenure and experience from states able to furnish data on two or more of these topics Column I gives in black bars the percentage with preparation beyond the high school which includes more or less professional training the striped bars indicate the additional percentage with full highschool preparation Louisiana had insufficient data for the highschool education column Missouri shows that 72 per cent of town teachers and 21 per cent of the country teachers were highschool graduatesa part of whom are included under professional training Column II presents the percentage of teachers who taught in the same district two years or less The average of the ten cases is 54 25 per cent serving two years or less in the same district This is in agreement with the findings in the preceding section that344 THE SCHOOL REVIEW rural teachers remain less than two years of 140 days each that 40 per cent of highschool teachers are new each year and that 50 per cent have a tenure two years or less and superintendents have a median tenure of barely two years Column III states the percentage with three years experience or less The average of the nine cases is 507 per cent with three years experience or less Just how much correlation there is between the three topics has not been worked out In the case of the town teachers in Missouri with 74 per cent with professional training and 72 per cent with highschool preparation only 42 per cent have served two years or less and only 32 per cent with three years experience or less In the city schools of Wisconsin only 385 per cent have served two years or less data for total experience would probably have shown the same tendency In the country schools of Missouri with 56 per cent having some professional training and 21 per cent with high school preparation 84 per cent have served two years or less and 65 per cent have three years or less teaching experience In the Wisconsin rural schools with 50 7 per cent with professional train ing 88 per cent have served two years or less and 66 per cent have had three years or less teaching experience There seems to be a closer correlation between training and total teaching experience for shift of position depends on things other than preparation In order to raise the standards of qualification it will be necessary to require that teachers secure adequate academic and professional training for the special work of teaching that communities make it more profitable for teachers of merit to remain permanently in their service and that the state raise standards of certifications and give salary and social esteem sufficient to retain permanently in the profession those persons specially fitted by nature and training for the high calling of the instruction of youth CONCLUSIONS The following are some of the more obvious implications sug gested by the

345 2 The data generally collected are insufficient to cover the whole field of educational problems and their arrangement curtails much of their usefulness One notes with great interest the growing tendency to remedy the above objections eg the reports of Missouri and Wisconsin 3 The available data on the educational qualifications of the teaching population indicate a serious lack of academic and pro fessional training In some parts of the United States the average education of teachers is not above the seventh grade in general 6o per cent or more of the teachers have not completed a normal or college course Rarely has practice come up even to the minimum standards raised for entering the ranks 4 The constant shift and short tenures of teachers and adminis trative agencies prevent the development of a permanent well laid educational policy either in a community or in a commonwealth 5 However much or little we value experience we must con clude that the total term of teaching service is far too brief for the majority of teachers in the United States to have passed through the crude apprenticeship stage 6 The present educational tendency demands both academic and professional training for teachers longer tenure in a position and permanent service in the profession Comparison with Conti nental countries reveals the fact that we have neither a learned nor a stable mature teaching population In Chancellor Eliots happy phrase We do not have a teaching profession so much as a teaching procession

STOUTEMYER KEARNEY STATE NORMAL SCHOOL KEARNEY NEBRASKA C THE EXPERIENCE OF THE TEACHING POPULATION THE DATA TO BE FOUND ON THE EXPERIENCE OF THE TEACHING POPULA TION ARE LIKEWISE MEAGER AND DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN FOGHT FOUND THAT THE AVERAGE AGE OF THE RURAL TEACHER WHEN BEGINNING WAS 192 YEARS WHICH WOULD PRECLUDE A VERY WIDE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE SOCIAL OR INTELLECTUAL ENVIRONMENT AND ORGANIZATION OF THE SCHOOL COFFMAN STATES THAT EVERY THIRD MAN AND EVERY SECOND WOMAN ENGAGED IN TEACHING IS UNDER TWENTYFOUR YEARS OF AGE AT LEAST ONEHALF OF THE TEACHERS OF THIS COUNTRY ARE LITTLE MORE THAN BOYS AND GIRLS TO P 235 NOT ONLY IS THERE THIS LACK OF MATURITY AND LACK OF ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL PREPARATION BUT THE LENGTH OF TIME SPENT IN TEACHING IS INSUFFICIENT TO GET BEYOND THE CRUDE APPRENTICESHIP STAGE COFFMAN STATES THAT ONEFOURTH OF THE TEACHERS HAVE HAD ONLY ONE YEAR OF EXPERIENCE AND ONEHALF HAVE HAD FOUR YEARS OR LESS COFFMAN AND JESSUP CONCLUDED FROM THEIR STUDY OF THE TEACHERS IN THE HIGH SCHOOLS OF THE NORTH CENTRAL ASSOCIATION THAT THE IMMA TURITY AND LACK OF WIDE EXPERIENCE IS SHOWN BY THE FACT THAT 13 PER CENT OF THESE TEACHERS HAVE HAD ONE YEARS EXPERIENCE OR LESS 20 PER CENT HAVE HAD TWO YEARS 29 PER CENT HAVE HAD THREE YEARS EXPERIENCE OR LESS IN CITIES OF 2500 AND UNDER ONEHALF HAD UNDER THREE YEARS 5000 AND UNDER ONEHALF LESS THAN FOUR YEARS THE MEDIAN EXPERIENCE RANGES FROM THREE TO EIGHT YEARS THE MORE EXPERIENCED BEING IN THE LARGE CITIES I5 P 98 SHIDELER FOUND THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF TEACHERS WITHOUT EXPERIENCE VARIED INDI RECTLY AND THE MEDIAN YEARS OF EXPERIENCE VARIED DIRECTLY WITH THE SIZE OF THE CITY CITIES OF 2500 OR LESS HAD A MUCH LARGER PERCENTAGE OF INEXPERIENCED TEACHERS AND THE MEDIAN YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WAS ALSO MUCH LESS THAN FOR LARGER CITIES 7 COFFMAN FOUND THAT 77 336QUALIFICATIONS AND TENURE OF TEACHING POPULATION 337 PER CENT OF THE RURAL TEACHERS 44 PER CENT OF THE TOWN TEACHERS 4465 PER CENT OF THE TEACHERS IN

MEASUREMENT OF TEACHING EFFICIENCY SEEMS DEBATABLE COFFMAN HOLDS THAT THE GREATEST CORRELATION BETWEEN TEACHING AND SALARY IS AT SIX YEARS INCREASE IN SALARY AFTER SIX YEARS DEPENDS ON FACTORS OTHER THAN EXPERIENCE I I BOYCE MAINTAINS THAT TEACHING EXPERI ENCE IS LESS IMPORTANT THAN INSTRUCTIONAL SKILL STUDIOUSNESS OR DIS CIPLINE HOWEVER EXPERIENCE IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN MODIFYING TEACHING ABILITY NO ELEMENTARYSCHOOL TEACHER RANKED FIRST OR SECOND WITH LESS THAN FIVE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AMONG HIGHSCHOOL TEACHERS THREE YEARS WAS THE MAXIMUM FOR GOOD TEACHERS THE AVERAGE EXPERIENCE OF ELEMENTARYSCHOOL TEACHERS FOR THE FIRST AND338 THE SCHOOL REVIEW SECOND CLASSES WAS 13 YEARS AND FOR THE LAST TWO CLASSES 8 5 YEARS THE AVERAGE EXPERIENCE OF HIGHSCHOOL TEACHERS FOR THESE CORRESPOND ING GROUPS WAS II 8 YEARS AND 639 YEARS RESPECTIVELY  I6 P 156 ACCORDING TO RUEDIGER AND STRAYER THE POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN LENGTH OF SERVICE AND GENERAL MERIT IS SIGNIFICANT  NO TEACHER RANKED EITHER FIRST OR SECOND WHO HAD TAUGHT LESS THAN FIVE YEARS AND ONLY 4 PER CENT HAD TAUGHT MORE THAN 25 YEARS  70 PER CENT OF THE TEACHERS IN THE FIRST RANK 69 PER CENT OF THOSE IN THE SECOND RANK 40 PER CENT OF THOSE IN THE SECOND LOWEST RANK 30 PER CENT OF THOSE IN THE LOWEST RANK HAD TAUGHT IO YEARS OR MORE THIS INDICATES EITHER THAT TEACHERS KEEP ON IMPROVING AND PASSING ON TO HIGHER RANK FOR AT LEAST TEN YEARS OR THAT THE POOREST TEACHERS ARE GRADUALLY ELIMINATED FROM THE SERVICE BOTH FACTORS PLAY A PART FROM THE FIGURES AS A WHOLE ONE MAY INFER THAT A TEACHER IN THE GRADES REACHES FIRSTCLASS EFFICIENCY IN ABOUT FIVE YEARS AND THAT SHE MAINTAINS THIS EFFICIENCY FOR ABOUT 20 YEARS AND THAT AFTER ABOUT 25 YEARS OF SERVICE SHE BEGINS TO DECLINE I17 P 276 THORNDIKE HOLDS THAT EXPERIENCE BEYOND THE FOURTH OR FIFTH YEAR DOES NOT ADD GREATLY TO THE EFFICIENCY OF THE PUBLICSCHOOL TEACHER YET THE PREMIUM ON EXPERIENCE HAS THE ADMINISTRATIVE ADVANTAGE OF ENCOURAGING THE ADOPTION OF TEACHING AS A PERMANENT PROFESSION AND OF PREVENTING FREQUENT CHANGES IN THE LOCAL TEACHING STAFF I8 P 41 D STANDARDS OF QUALIFICATION A COMPARISON OF THE EDUCATIONAL QUALIFICATIONS AND TENURE OF OUR TEACHING POPULATION WITH THAT OF SOME OF THE CONTINENTAL COUN TRIES MAY AID US IN UNDERSTANDING WHAT OUGHT TO BE OUR STANDARD OF QUALIFICATION THE RISE OF MODERN GERMANY TO A VANTAGE POINT IN EVERY FIELD OF ACTIVITY IN THE WORLDS WORK IS DUE TO AN EFFECTIVE SCHOOL SYSTEM AND A THOROUGHLY TRAINED CORPS OF SCHOOLMASTERS SINCE THE FRANCOPRUSSIAN WAR FRANCE HAS REORGANIZED HER SCHOOLS AND TRAINED HER TEACHERS FOR THE REJUVENATION OF HER NATIONAL RESOURCES BUT WE NEED NOT LIMIT OURSELVES TO THESE TWO WORLD POWERS WHOSE PRESENT PROWESS IS THE RESULT OF INTENSIVE EDUCATION THE TWO SMALL NATIONS SWITZERLAND AND DENMARK AFFORD AMPLE MATERIAL TO PROVE THAT THE REAL WEALTH OF A NATION LIES NOT IN THE ABUNDANCE OF ITS NATURAL RESOURCES BUT IN A THRIFTY INTELLIGENT PEOPLEQUALIFICATIONS AND TENURE OF TEACHING POPULATION 339 THE FOLLOWING SHORT CITATION FROM PROFESSOR TATES STUDY OF SWISS SCHOOLS PRESENTS A SHARP CONTRAST TO OUR TEACHER PROBLEM TO AN AMERICAN ONE OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE THINGS CONNECTED WITH THE SWISS SCHOOL SYSTEM IS THE STABILITY OF THE TEACHING PROFESSION THREEFOURTHS OF THE TEACHERS ARE MEN AND PRACTICALLY ALL THE TEACHERS WHOM I MET HAVE ENGAGED IN THE BUSINESS AS A LIFEWORK TEACHING IS RARELY USED AS A STEPPING STONE TO SOME OTHER PROFESSION THERE IS VERY LITTLE SHIFTING OF THE TEACHING FORCE FROM PLACE TO PLACE I SPENT TEN DAYS WITH A SCHOOL INSPECTOR IN CANTON BERNE HE HAS 240 TEACHERS UNDER HIS SUPERVISION ONLY 12 OF THEM WERE TEACHING FOR THE FIRST YEAR IN THE POSITION WHICH THEY HELD IT IS NO UNUSUAL THING FOR A TEACHER TO SPEND A LONG LIFE IN ONE POSITION ADMISSION TO THE TEACHING PROFESSION USUALLY MEANS GRADUATION FROM THE TEACHERS SEMINARY WHICH REQUIRES FOR ENTERING AN EIGHT OR NINEYEAR COURSE OFFERED IN THE COMMON SCHOOLS TEACHERS IN THE GYMNASIUM OR THE MIDDLE SCHOOLS ARE USUALLY UNIVERSITY GRADUATES AFTER SECURING A CERTIFICATE THE SWISS TEACHER USUALLY ACTS AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR A YEAR OR TWO BEFORE FINALLY BEING ELECTED TO A PERMANENT POSITION 19 P 27 WITHIN THE LAST HALFCENTURY THE DECADENT LIFE OF DENMARK HAS BEEN REJUVENATED THROUGH THE WORK OF HER SCHOOLS WITH AN EFFICIENT CORPS OF TEACHERS THESE TEACHERS MUST HAVE COMPLETED THE COURSE OF STUDY AT THE NORMAL SCHOOL OR UNIVERSITY BEFORE BEING APPOINTED PERMANENT TEACHERS NONGRADUATES MAY SERVE AS APPRENTICE TEACHERS OR ASSISTANTS BUT NOT AS REGULAR TEACHERS OUT OF 3812 MEN ONLY 141 WERE NONGRADUATES OUT OF 1453 WOMEN 438 WERE NONGRADUATES OUT OF A TOTAL OF 5265 TEACHERS 579 WERE NON GRADUATES THIS PRESENTS A SHARP CONTRAST TO OUR CONDITION LOUISIANA 191314 FOR EXAMPLE HAS APPROXIMATELY THE SAME NUMBER OF TEACHERS 5658 YET 3264 ARE NONGRADUATES A SECOND CONTRAST IS WITH REGARD TO THE MATURITY OF THE DANISH TEACHERS MEN TEACHERS TWENTYFOUR YEARS OLD OR UNDER CONSTITUTE ONLY 7 PER CENT OF THE TOTAL TWENTYNINE YEARS OLD OR UNDER 20 PER CENT THIRTYNINE YEARS OLD OR UNDER 50 PER CENT THAT IS HALF OF THE MEN TEACHERS ARE FORTY YEARS OLD OR OVER MATURE MEN GIVING INSTRUCTION TO YOUTH WOMEN TEACHERS TWENTYFOUR YEARS OLD OR UNDER CONSTITUTE 23 PER CENT TWENTYNINE YEARS OR UNDER 48 PER CENT THAT IS OVER HALF OF THE WOMEN TEACHERS ARE MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS OLD AND ARE MATURE ENOUGH TO BE REAL LEADERS IN THE LIFEPROBLEMS OF YOUTH SEE P 18 SINCE TEACHING IS A PERMANENT340 THE SCHOOL REVIEW PROFESSION THE TEACHERS FEEL THAT IT IS WORTH WHILE TO GROW UP WITH A PLACE AND SELDOM SERVE LESS THAN TEN YEARS IN THE SAME COMMUNITY PROFESSIONAL TRAINING AND LONG TENURES HAVE BEEN WROUGHT WITH GREAT INFLUENCE ON THE RURAL COMMUNITY LIFE THE TEACHERS ARE TRAINED FOR COUNTRY LIFE AND UNDERSTAND ITS NEEDS THEY ENTER UPON THEIR TASKS KNOWING THAT THEY HAVE TIME TO REAR WELL AND FUNDAMENTALLY THIS RESULTS IN A COMMUNITY LEADERSHIP WHICH CANNOT BE HOPED FROM PERIPATETIC TEACHERS AS IS THE CASE WITH TEACHERS IN MOST AMERICAN SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHO REMAIN IN COUNTRY SCHOOLS FOR A TERM OR TWO AND USE THEM AS STEPPINGSTONES TO TOWNSCHOOL TEACHING OR OTHER OCCUPATIONS DANISH RURAL DISTRICTS CAN COUNT HUNDREDS OF TEACHERS WHO WOULD NOT EXCHANGE THEIR POSITIONS FOR A FIRSTCLASS INSPECTORSHIP IN COPENHAGENALL BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN ENABLED BY THESE FORTUNATE ARRANGE MENTS TO HEW OUT FOR THEMSELVES WHERE THEY ARE AN IMPORTANT NICHE IN THE EDUCATIONAL LIFE OF THE PEOPLE 20 PP 13840 IN OUR EDUCATIONAL WORLD THERE IS A GENERAL ACCEPTANCE OF SCHURMANS ASSERTIONS THAT WE CANNOT TEACH WHAT WE DO NOT KNOW AND THAT WE CANNOT TEACH AS MUCH AS WE KNOW FOR MUCH IS LOST IN THE PROCESS OF TRANSITION HENCE IT IS GENERALLY AGREED THAT A TEACHER SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE COMPLETED THE DIVISION OF OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM ABOVE THAT IN WHICH SHE WOULD TEACH THUS IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO DEMAND THAT ELEMENTARY TEACHERS SHOULD HAVE COMPLETED THE HIGH SCHOOL PRESENT OPINION WOULD ADD THAT PRO FESSIONAL TRAINING IN AN APPROVED TEACHERTRAINING INSTITUTION IS A NECESSARY PART OF AN ADEQUATE PREPARATION FOR HIGHSCHOOL TEACHERS IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO DEMAND THAT THEY HAVE COMPLETED A COLLEGE COURSE OR ITS EQUIVALENT PRESENT OPINION WOULD ADD THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE SPECIAL TRAINING IN THE SUBJECTS THEY WOULD TEACH TOGETHER WITH INSTRUCTION IN THE PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE OF TEACHING A DECADE AGO LOW STANDARDS AND LACK OF UNIFORMITY ACCORDING TO CUBBERLY WERE THE CHIEF WEAKNESSES OF OUR SYSTEM OF CERTIFICA TION IN MORE THAN HALF OF THE STATES OF THE UNION IT IS POSSIBLE TO SECURE A TEACHERS CERTIFICATE AND BECOME A TEACHER WITH NO OTHER EDUCATIONAL EQUIPMENT THAN A KNOWLEDGE OF THE COMMONSCHOOL SUBJECTSTHE MEREST RUDIMENTS OF AN EDUCATION IN ABOUT ONE FOURTH OF THE STATES NO EXAMINATION UPON TOPICS OF A PROFESSIONAL NATURE IS REQUIRED AND THE PROSPECTIVE TEACHER APPARENTLY IS NOT EXPECTED TO KNOW ANYTHING AS TO THE PROFESSIONAL SIDE OF

HAVE HIGHSCHOOL PREPARATION AND FULL NORMAL TRAIN ING AND HIGHSCHOOL TEACHERS MUST HAVE COMPLETED COLLEGE AND HAVE ONE YEAR OF GRADUATE STUDY ONEHALF OF WHICH IS IN EDUCATIONAL WORK OUR EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE HAS TAUGHT US THAT LOW STANDARDS OF CERTIFICATION AND LOW WAGES GO TOGETHER AS LONG AS LOW STANDARDS OF CERTIFICATION AND LOW WAGES DOMINATE OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM SO LONG MUST SHORT TERMS OF SERVICE AND CONSTANT RECRUITING OF THE RANKS CHARACTERIZE OUR TEACHING POPULATION MANY SUPERINTENDENTS STATE THAT THE BESTPREPARED TEACHERS REMAIN LONGEST IN THE PRO FESSION THOUGH THEY OFFER NO STATISTICS SHOWING THE EXTENT OF THIS FACTOR THE HISTORY OF EDUCATION INCLUDING THE PRESENTDAY SYS TEMS OF FRANCE AND PRUSSIA SHOWS THAT THE SOCIAL STATUS OF THE TEACHER VARIES DIRECTLY WITH THE PROFESSIONAL TRAINING AND FITNESS ONQUALIFICATIONS AND TENURE OF TEACHING POPULATION 343 THE PART OF THE TEACHER AND ADEQUATE RETURN IN SALARY AND SOCIAL ESTEEM ON THE PART OF THE STATE 22 THE REQUIREMENT OF HIGHER STANDARDS OF CERTIFICATION IS AN EDUCATIONAL PROBLEM THE PAYMENT OF A JUST WAGE IS AN ECONOMIC PROBLEM DEPENDING FOR ITS SOLUTION ON HOW MUCH MONEY THE STATE WILL PAY FOR PROFESSIONAL TRAINING AND FITNESS IF THE STATE REQUIRED HIGH QUALIFICATIONS AND GAVE IN RETURN ADEQUATE SALARY AND SOCIAL ESTEEM INCLUDING TENURE DURING EFFICIENCY AND FREEDOM FROM DREAD OF DEPENDENCY AND OLD AGE TEACHING WOULD BECOME NOT ONLY A STABLE BUT A LEARNED PROFESSION FOR AS THE EXPERI ENCE OF FRANCE HAS DEMONSTRATED WITH SMALL NEED FOR RECRUITS TRAINING SCHOOLS COULD THEN PROVIDE TRAINED TEACHERS FOR ALL VACANCIES E SUMMARY IN THE SECTION ON THE EDUCATIONAL QUALIFICATIONS OF THE TEACHING POPULATION THE STATISTICS SHOWED THAT THE EDUCATIONAL UNPREPARED NESS OF THE TEACHING POPULATION WAS THE MOST SERIOUS WEAKNESS IN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM TABLE I AND CHART I GIVE FOR THE STATES REPRE SENTED 6O PER CENT WITH HIGHSCHOOL PREPARATION OR LESS AND 40 PER CENT WITH MORE THAN HIGHSCHOOL

HAS NOT BEEN WORKED OUT IN THE CASE OF THE TOWN TEACHERS IN MISSOURI WITH 74 PER CENT WITH PROFESSIONAL TRAINING AND 72 PER CENT WITH HIGHSCHOOL PREPARATION ONLY 42 PER CENT HAVE SERVED TWO YEARS OR LESS AND ONLY 32 PER CENT WITH THREE YEARS EXPERIENCE OR LESS IN THE CITY SCHOOLS OF WISCONSIN ONLY 385 PER CENT HAVE SERVED TWO YEARS OR LESS DATA FOR TOTAL EXPERIENCE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE SHOWN THE SAME TENDENCY IN THE COUNTRY SCHOOLS OF MISSOURI WITH 56 PER CENT HAVING SOME PROFESSIONAL TRAINING AND 21 PER CENT WITH HIGH SCHOOL PREPARATION 84 PER CENT HAVE SERVED TWO YEARS OR LESS AND 65 PER CENT HAVE THREE YEARS OR LESS TEACHING EXPERIENCE IN THE WISCONSIN RURAL SCHOOLS WITH 50 7 PER CENT WITH PROFESSIONAL TRAIN ING 88 PER CENT HAVE SERVED TWO YEARS OR LESS AND 66 PER CENT HAVE HAD THREE YEARS OR LESS TEACHING EXPERIENCE THERE SEEMS TO BE A CLOSER CORRELATION BETWEEN TRAINING AND TOTAL TEACHING EXPERIENCE FOR SHIFT OF POSITION DEPENDS ON THINGS OTHER THAN PREPARATION IN ORDER TO RAISE THE STANDARDS OF QUALIFICATION IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO REQUIRE THAT TEACHERS SECURE ADEQUATE ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING FOR THE SPECIAL WORK OF TEACHING THAT COMMUNITIES MAKE IT MORE PROFITABLE FOR TEACHERS OF MERIT TO REMAIN PERMANENTLY IN THEIR SERVICE AND THAT THE STATE RAISE STANDARDS OF CERTIFICATIONS AND GIVE SALARY AND SOCIAL ESTEEM SUFFICIENT TO RETAIN PERMANENTLY IN THE PROFESSION THOSE PERSONS SPECIALLY FITTED BY NATURE AND TRAINING FOR THE HIGH CALLING OF THE INSTRUCTION OF YOUTH CONCLUSIONS THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME OF THE MORE OBVIOUS IMPLICATIONS SUG GESTED BY THE

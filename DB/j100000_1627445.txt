this country and Europe and attempting to ad vance upon anything that has been done hitherto Thus the Park although far from complete in many respects marks a great step forward in zoological park develop ment Most of the animals enjoy an ex ceptional amount of freedom The ranges in the smaller installations are numerous and as a rule the animals are in a splendid state of health There have been relatively few losses The rate of growth of the ani mals especially in the Reptile House and the Bear Dens and in the interior Flying Cage for Birds is rapid and there is every reason to believe that most of these animals are in a perfectly normal state Naturally the more purely scientific work in the Society must be deferred The field of publication has hardly been entered upon The admirable  Guide  which was prepared by the Director is proving very popular and has met with large sales Illustrated bul letins describing the development of the Park have appeared only at rare intervals but it is hoped to make them more regular next winter Considerable progress has already been made in photography and many of the photographs of living animals are not only beautiful but possess consider able scientific value as presenting perfect representations of pure types of North American and exotic animals seen to best advantage in their natural surroundings HENRY F OSBORN SIGMA XI AT THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE DURING the last meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Sci ence at Columbus Ohio the convention of Sigma Xi was held with a very large at tendance and it was decided to have a re union of such members of the Society as might attend the meetings of the American Association at New York It is planned therefore to hold a meeting at which all members of Sigma Xi are cordially invited to be present some evening during the meet ing of the Association in New York The date and hour of the meeting will be an nounced by posters and in the daily pro gram The rapid rise of this Society in Ameri can universities is signified by the large number of young men prominent among the officers and participants in the various sections of the American Association It was started in 1886 at Cornell University by a few graduate students in engineering At first the intention was to make it a purely engineering society but soon after its organization the scope of the Society was broadened so as to take in all the most promising men in the Senior classes giving special attention to any of the branches of science In its extension to other institutions it has become the repre sentative honorsociety for the ablest stu dents of science in the institutions where it is established According to the constitution the object of the Society is to  encourage original in vestigation in science pure and applied In the report of the Committee on Extension made at the convention of 1895 the follow ing words lexpress the purpose of the So ciety  In establishing a new chapter    in each case we should make sure that we entrust the power of distributing the honor of membership only to such persons and institutions as are capable of giving the education and training necessary to the carrying on of scientific investigation    we should also be well assured of the hearty cooperation of the scientific faculty in the establishment of the local chapter At present there are ten chapters con nected with the following institutions and the eleventh has already been voted al though not yet established 965SCIENCE 1 Rensselaer Polytechnic

the chapters have been established the organization takes the place of Phi Beta Kappa among the science men and the purpose of the or ganization is to recognize and associate the men of marked ability in scientific studies The Society has been running long enough to show very clearly that there is an aca demic side to science as well as to literature and that the academic qualities promoted by scientific studies are as important as those fostered by the pure study of litera ture It will be interesting to note in the course of the year to what extent the culture of the scientific qualifications of men gives them power of leadership among their fel lows It is certain that in business affairs we are already observing the important place which scientific ability takes in the really dominant men in America If the conceptions of Sigma Xi are correct we shall see a similar condition of leadership among the scientific scholars of the country when sufficient numbers of such scholars have been developed to overcome the prec edence which we are accustomed to grant to literature as the standard of real scholar ship The chapters recently started in the University of Pennsylvania and in Brown University exhibit the enthusiasm which is already being kindled in this department of university life The charter membership in both of these cases was composed practi cally of the whole staff of scientific profess ors of the university As an honor society it promises to take a leading part in all our universities in which science holds a prom inent place The present officers of the Society are President H S Williams Yale VicePresi dent S W Williston Kansas Correspond ing Secretary J McMahon Cornell Record ing Secretary F C Caldwell Ohio Treasurer E W Davis Nebraska Chairman of Coun cil E L Nichols Cornell THE BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND THE PEOPLE LIKE the American Association for the Advancement of Science and other similar organizations the Michigan Academy is an expression of the voluntary scientific activ ity of the people of the State and depends for its continued usefulness on a rational interest and a helpful cooperation on the part of the people It has therefore occurred to me to inquire in what way the biological sciences from whose adherents the Academy draws most of its membership touch the people what in the growth of these sciences makes toward and what away from a contributory interest on the part of the people By contributory interest is meant that which aids in the upbuilding of the sciences by adding some thing of importance to their store of fact or theory The question that is raised is then not what benefit do the people receive from the biological sciences for these are many in the practical and in the educational applica tion of these sciences the question is rather how may or how do the people benefit these sciences by aiding in their further growth I shall speak from the zoological stand point but what is true of zoology is true in this matter in large measure also of botany The question seems to be intimately as sociated with the recent history of zoology  Abstract of the address of the

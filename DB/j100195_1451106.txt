and many passages are almost illegible The name of the author Nehemiah b Kohen Zedeq is written on the verso which is otherwise blank in a hand different from that of the text and perhaps a little later There is how ever no reason to doubt the ascription Nehemiah became Gaon of Pumbeditha in 961 and as the date Kislev 274 at the end  1274 Sel  Dec 962 AD seems to be that of the writing this may be his autograph The purport of the letter is much the same as that of his predecessor if the first letter in No I is rightly attributed to Aaron Gaon The College at Pumbeditha is neglected in 962 as it was ten years before and Nehemiah insists with an almost pathetic earnestness on the duty of supporting it The letter does not add much to our scanty knowledge of the period but considering that we possess nothing by this Gaon and only know of him from his enemies the text seems worth pub lishing It is most unfortunate that the early part of it is so much broken since in line 4 he is evidently speaking of some one who died in Nisan of the previous year  April 962 though the expressions used can hardly apply to his predecessor Aaron with whom he was on the worst of terms He was however apparently anxious to put matters in the most favourable light as we see from the account of his accession in line I9 which hardly agrees with what is known from Sherira Who the two young men were

c 28 fol 15 Paper Ii x 8 inches The letter consists of 27 lines unskilfully written with some correc tions It is an appeal from the Jews of Jerusalem to Ephraim ben Shemariah of Egypt for help in their difficulties The number of pilgrims has fallen off and the contributions do not enable them to pay the heavy taxes There is no date but as Ephraim was a person of importance who appears in several documents we are able to determine it with some degree of certainty In MS Heb a 2 fol 4 Catal no 2805 dated 1030 at FostAt he is a witness to the Kethubhah of Berakhah bath Shemariah his sister In MS Heb b i fol 12 Catal no 2874 he is also a witness The deed is broken and the date incomplete the tens being lost In the Catalogue I have given it as 47o7 AM but as the verso is dated 1039 it is probably 4797 AM 1037 AD Another fragmentary deed to which he is a witness is MS Heb c 28 fol 30 Catal no 2876 dated 1041 at   on the Pishon A letter addressed to him in MS Heb d 65 fol4 Catal no 2877 is dated 1035 The letter in MS Heb a 3 fol 28 Catal no 2873 was written about the same time as I hope to show in a future number I misread the date when writing the description for the Catalogue The present letter may then reasonably be supposed to belong to some time about 10301040 Since the text was in type I learn from Dr Poznanski that it has been already published by Wertheimer from whom it was bought in his nSwln N II fol 17 Jerusalem 190I However it was desirable to reprint it in connexion with the other documents relating to Ephraim WtWpn ni MD twnDson 121 04rnnl Dmn tn

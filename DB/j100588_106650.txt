on local Heat In a Letter from James Six Esq to the Rev Francis Wollaston LLB F R S Read January 10 1788 D E A R S I R THE following experiments are a continuation of those I had the pleasure of communicating to you some time since relating to the diversity of local heat in the atmosphere and confirm in a more particular manner my former obser vations respecting a remarkable refrigeration which in clear weather takes place near the earth for although its surface in the daytime is then most liable to be heated by the sun yet after that is set and during the night the air is always found coldest near the ground particularly in vallies This phaeno menon for want of nocturnal observations has been but lately noticed  probably because in the daytime especially when the  Within these few years Mr WILSON in the Philosophical Transactions 1780 p 467 and 1781 p 368 describing the effects of a severe srost at Glasgow mentions a remarkable refrigeration which he perceived to take place on the surface of the snow and hoarfrost which sunk the mercury in a thermometer laid upon it many degrees lower than one suspended twentyfour feet above it This phaenomenon he says had recently come under observation but supposing I presume the principle of refrigeration to operate only on the surface of the snow or hoarfrost when the cold was severe it does not appear he made experiments at any other time In104 Mr SIXS Experiments the weather is still and warm the difference of temperature is reversed the reflection of the suns rays from the earth heating the air more below than it does above The experiments in my former Paper  were made partly in autumn and partly in winter and the local variations dif fering in some measure with the seasons I was desirous of continuing a series of experiments throughout one entire year To this end therefore I suspended proper thermometers  in a shady northern aspect in the open air at different heights one in my garden at nine feet and another in the Cathedral Tower 220 feet from the ground continuing my journal with the omission of a few days only from July 1784 till July 1785 In the summer of 1783 making experiments with thermometers which I had constructed to shew the greatest degrees of heat and cold that happened in the observers absence I first perceived this nocturnal refrigeration in the lowest stratum of the atmosphere for by suspending these thermometers at different altitudes and viewing them only once in twentyfour hours I found the true maximum and minimum of the heat and cold which had happened during that time in their several stations A writer in the Gentlemans Magazine for March 1785 p 170 who did me the honour to mention my former Paper containing Experiments on Local Heat observed that the effects of a sharp frost which happened in December of the pre ceding year appeared to be much more severe among the vegetables in the vallies than on the hills and by taking the difference of temperature with thermometers at that time he found them vary from 5 to 17 degrees according to their several stations M DE SAUSSURE in his Voyages dans les Alpes Vol II published 1786 says  Quant a lobservation bien

with what I had before ob served respecting the nocturnal diminution of heat and the particular state of the atmosphere requisite to produce it The greatest variations which happened within the year were in October and June in the former month the thermometers generally differed most in the night in the latter most in the day From the 25th to the 28th of October the heat below in the night exceeded in a small degree the heat above at which time there was frequent rain sometimes mingled with hail From the 11th to the 14th and also on the 31st there was no variation at all during which time likewise the wea ther was rainy all the rest of the month proving clear the air was found colder below than it was above sometimes 9 or 10 degrees In the month of June the greatest nocturnal variations happened from the 11th to the 15th and from the 25th to the 30th at both which times there appeared to be two currents of wind the upper current from the S W the lower from the N E  On cloudy nights the lowest thermometer sometimes shewed the heat to be a degree or two warmer than the upper one but in the day time the heat below constantly exceeded the heat above more than in the month of October See Tab I and II  Being  Sometimes these were rendered visible by clouds in different strata moving in different directions and at other times by clouds moving in a contrary direction to a very sensible current of air below  The observations of the wind and weather were taken at Canterbury In all the tables the nocturnal degrees of cold belong to the night immediately preceding the day to the date of which they are placedWith my thermometer I have sometimes suspended hygrometers but their movement although as con formable as possible to the moisture of the air had not a sufficiently regular correspondence with the variation of the thermometers to be inserted in the V O L LXXVIII P tables106 Mr SIXS Experiments Being desirous of knowing whether the nocturnal refrigera tion increased on a nearer approach to the surface of the earth I placed in the midst of an open meadow on the bank of the river near this city two thermometers one on the ground and the other six feet above it with these and the two others before mentioned one on the tower and the other in my garden I made observations from the 10th to the 23d of Octo ber 1786 See Tab III But as the thermometer six feet from the ground in the meadow nearly agreed with that in the garden at nine feet I have omitted an account of the latter in this table of comparison Here I found as before the noc turnal variations entirely regulated by the clearness or the cloudiness of the sky and although they did not always happen in the same proportion to the respective altitudes yet when the thermometers differed at all that on the ground was always the coldest Finding so considerable a difference as three degrees and a half within six feet of the earths surface I increased the number of my thermometers in the meadow to four one of them I sunk in the ground another I placed just upon the ground a third I suspended at three feet and a fourth at six feet from the ground at the same time I placed three thermo meters in an open garden on St Thomass Hill where the land is level with the Cathedral Tower and about a mile distant from it here I likewise put one in the ground ano ther just upon it and suspended a third six feet above it tables of comparison It is true when the weather was clear and not too cold the upper ones indicated dryness more than the lower but in frosty weather the contraction and expansion of the hygrometers being impeded by the frost they did not in any regular manner agree with the variations of the thermometer Withon local Heat 107 With these seven thermometers and the two before men tioned in the city I continued a diary for twenty days taking also every morning the temperature of the water in the river but the weather proving cloudy soon after the thermometers hardly varied at all seven or eight days only excepted After this time I never rectified them but when the appearance of the weather gave me reason to expect that they would vary consi derably See the observations that were then taken Tab IV by which it appears that the cold in the night was generally greater in the valley than that on the hill but that the varia tions between the thermometers on the ground and those six feet above them were often as great on the hill as in the valley Perceiving now that a difference of temperature was frequently found within three feet from the ground I resolved to try still nearer but my thermometers being eighteen inches in height could not be applied so near to the surface of the earth as my experiment required I therefore constructed two others for the particular purpose and by bending down the large tube the bulb or body of the thermometer to an horizontal position while the smaller tubes remained in a ver tical one I was enabled to ascertain the different degrees of heat from the ground to a single inch At certain times when the weather was clear I exposed these two horizontal thermometers in an open place suspend ing one of them so as to bring the body of it within an inch of the ground and the other nine inches above it When the variation among the other thermometers was considerable I found also a difference between these the lower one indi cating sometimes more than two degrees less heat than the P 2 upper108 Mr SIXS Experiments upper one although they were placed so near to each other See Tab V From the foregoing experiments it appears that a greater diminution of heat frequently takes place near the earth in the nighttime than at any elevation in the atmosphere within the limits of my inquiry and that the greatest degrees of cold are at such times always found nearest to the surface of the earth that this is a constant and regular operation of nature under certain circumstances and dispositions of the atmosphere and takes place at all seasons of the year that this difference never happens in any considerable degree but when the air is still and the sky perfectly unclouded  but the moistest vapour such as dews and fogs  did not as far as I could perceive at all impede but rather increase the refri geration In very severe frosts when the air frequently depo sits a great quantity of frozen vapour I have generally found it greatest  but the excess of heat which in daytime in the summer season was found at the lower station in the winter diminished almost to nothing The foregoing experiments related to the difference of heat which at certain times is found at different altitudes the  Free from clouds which float higher in the air than fogs and are sufficiently opaque to hide the stars from our view even in the zenith  When fogs covered the valley the refrigeration below was considerable but they very seldem reached so high as the upper thermometer and the sky was clear above No variation during rain except mingled with hail  This remarkable diminution of heat near the surface of the earth in clear weather after the sun is set and in the night proceeds I apprehend partly from the coolness which the dews or vapours possibly may acquire in their descent and partly from the evaporation which takes place at the same time from all moist or frozen bodies exposed to the open air particularly from those on which the dew or hoar frost is deposited 7 followingon local Heat 109 following to the different degrees of heat observed at different situations in respect to the seashore Tab VI and VII contain a set of corresponding observations among which are those you were so obliging as to take for me at Chislehurst  others at the same time were taken in my garden and on the Cathe dral Tower and others on the seashore about seven miles NNW from Canterbury where the thermometer was sus pended about 40 feet above highwater mark 14 from the ground and about 100 yards from the sea  By Tab VI it appears that every night one only ex cepted during that time the air was coldest at Chislehurst and that the mean heat at the seashore was equal to that on the tower at Canterbury In the month of June Tab VII it is remarkable that the cold was still greater in the night at Chislehurst than at any of the other places excepting where there appeared two currents of wind the upper current from the SW and the lower from the NE at which time also there was the greatest difference between the thermometer in the garden and that on the tower Tab VIII contains observations taken only at particular times when the weather was extremely cold and shews how nearly at such times the temperature in the night at the sea shore generally agreed with that on the Cathedral Tower with this exception however that on the 18th 21st and 22d of February 1784 a little snow falling at several times in the day the evenings after being clear and the wind at NE the thermometer on the seashore contrary to what usually happened gave the cold greater than the thermometer on the  The thermometer at Chislehurst was suspended twelve feet from the ground  The thermometer on the Cathedral Tower was elevated about 200 above that on the seashore tower110 Mr SIXS Experiments tower but under similar circumstances I have since seen the same The following experiments relate to the variation of local heat in the earth itself the diversity of which appears from the different heat of the water issuing from it at different places  It has been conjectured that the diversity of the temperature of springs may probably depend on their different elevations in the earth with respect to the level of the sea Two remarkably deep wells both near the seashore and not far distant from Canterbury gave me a favourable oppor tunity of making experimental inquiry into this matter espe cially as the situation of the two springs differed considerably from each other in respect to the level of the sea One of these is a well in Dover Castle which is sunk 360 feet through the high cliff of chalk on which the Castle stands and the depth of the well is nearly equal to the height of the cliff from the sea The other is KingsWell at Sheerness  which was sunk 330 feet through almost one entire stratum of firm clay where the surface of the ground is only four feet above high water Supposing therefore the spring in Dover well to lie level with the sea the spring of the well at Sheerness lies 326 feet below it a circumstance extremely favourable to my experi  The temperature here meant is not that of the very hot springs which proceed from particular local causes sometimes rising near the surface of the earth nor of springs which are near enough to the surface of the earth to be affected by the change of temperature in the atmosphere but that heat which being found at a great depth is more likely to be permanent and may be supposed to originate from some general cause in the earth  See an account of sinking this curious well by Sir THOMAS PAGE Phil Trans Vol LXXIV p 6 menton local Heat 111 ment The temperature of the springs I took in the following manner After fathoming each well with a line and plummet I let one thermometer down to the bottom and fixed another on the line so as to reach to half the depth only keeping a third to take the temperature of the air at the top Degrees of heat in the wells Sept 28 1784 Temperature of Oct 6 1784 Temperature of the water in the new well in the water in Kings Well Dover Castle at Sheerness By thermometer at the top 56 By thermometer at the top 53 By ditto at the middle 52 By ditto at the middle 51 By ditto at the bottom 4834 By ditto at the bottom 56 Found the well 360 feet deep Found the well 280 feet with 21 feet water deep  with 180 feet water About noon was the time of day when I made the experi ments at both places and the top of the respective wells vary ing from each other depended wholly on the accidental tempe rature of the atmosphere at the time but that the thermome ter at half the depth of the well at Dover gave nearly the mean heat of the top and bottom while that in a correspond ing situation in the well at Sheerness gave it colder than either top or bottom I attribute to the following circumstance Over the well at Sheerness a machine is erected which raises the water by means of an horizontal windmill working an endless chain This chain consisting of jointed double bars with a number of buckets fixed thereon at certain distances from each other continually descending into and ascending out of the water to an elevation of eight or nine feet above  The sand brought up from the bottom of the well by the force of the spring has reduced it to its present depth the112 Mr SIXS Experiments the top of the well may be supposed to reduce the water as far as it reaches to the mean temperature of the air above and thus I found it for 51 degrees had been the mean temperature of the air near the seashore for several days before At the bottom of the well near to which the chain never descends I found the temperature 56 degrees above 7 degrees warmer than that at Dover well The water at the bottom of these wells is I presume too deep beneath the surface of the earth ever to be affected by the temperature of the atmosphere for if the heat of the summer could have had any influence on either of them that at Dover must have been most considerably affected by it especially in the month of September and the air was something warmer when the experiment was made at Dover than at Sheerness From the nature of the different kinds of strata in which these wells are dug had they been in all other circumstances the same one might reasonably expect to find the warmer spring in the chalk and the colder in the clay but here the reverse is seen without any apparent local cause except the different elevations of the springs in respect to the level of the sea I am c JAMES SIX Canterbury August 1 1787 T A B L Eon local Heat T A B L E I Thermometers at different stations compared together Night Day 1784 In the On the Differ In the On the

J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1075379,REGULATION OF ATHLETICS IN MISSOURI AND ADJACENT TERRITORY,I244555,REGULATION OF ATHLETICS RN MISSOURI AND ADJACENT TERRITORY THE PROBLEM OF ATHLETIC CONTROL IN MISSOURI IS THE SAME FOR EACH COLLEGE IN THE SOUTH OR SOUTHWEST IN FACT IT IS THE SAME FOR ANY COLLEGE WHERE SOCIAL INFLUENCES IN THE ENVIRONMENT THE SENTIMENTS GENERAL TRAINING ENERGY STABILITY AND FINANCIAL STATUS OF THE STUDENT BODY MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN HIGHLY DEVEL OPED TEAMS AND WHERE FURTHER THE EXAMPLE AND METHODS OF GREAT INFLUENTIAL NEIGHBORING COLLEGES GIVE STANDARDS FOR ACHIEVE MENT WHICH CANNOT NORMALLY BE MAINTAINED GIVEN THESE CON DITIONS DOMINATING THE DEVELOPMENT OF ATHLETICS IN ANY COLLEGE THEIR REGULATION IS ALWAYS DIFFICULT MY PAPER MIGHT WELL BE CALLED WHAT I HAVE LEARNED CON CERNING THE REGULATION OF ATHLETICS FROM MY EXPERIENCE IN MISSOURI FOR INASMUCH AS MISSOURI HAS BEEN THE CENTER OF THE MOST RECENT STRUGGLE FOR HIGH STANDARDS IN ATHLETICS INTIMATELY ASSOCIATED WITH ALL THE COLLEGES OF THE SOUTHWEST IN THAT STRUGGLE AND OVERSHADOWED BY THE INFLUENCES OF THE LARGER COLLEGES TO THE NORTH IT HAS BEEN A VANTAGEPOINT FROM WHICH TO STUDY PRESENT DAY TENDENCIES IN COLLEGE ATHLETICS HAVING GONE TO MISSOURI WITH SOME KNOWLEDGE OF ATHLETIC CONDITIONS ON THE PACIFIC COAST AND IN NEW ENGLAND I HAVE COME TO FEEL THAT THERE ARE FACTORS WHICH ARE EVERYWHERE CONSTANT IN THEIR CORRUPTING INFLUENCE ON ATHLETICS AND THAT THESE FACTORS SHOULD RECEIVE OUR EARNEST ATTEN TION IN ALL EFFORTS TOWARD ATHLETIC REGULATION I BELIEVE THAT THEY GIVE THE KEY TO THE PRESENT SITUATION IN ATHLETICS THEY SUGGEST NEW LINES OF ATTACK FOR THE REGULATION AND CONTROL OF ATHLETICS THEREFORE IT IS OF THESE FACTORS THAT I FIRST WISH TO SPEAK I FIRST AMONG THE FACTORS THAT ARE CONSTANT IN THEIR TENDENCIES TOWARD CORRUPTION IS SCHOLASTIC PROVINCIALISM THIS TERM DOES NOT REFER TO THE LOCAL PRIDE THAT MAKES FOR COLLEGE SPIRIT BUT TO THE CRUDE UNINTELLIGENT PREJUDICES AGAINST RIVAL COLLEGES IT LEADS TO BAD FEELING DISTRUST HATE AND COMBATIVENESS IN PLACE OF GOODFELLOWSHIP COURTESY AND A MANLY RIVALRY PROVINCIALISM 329THE SCHOOL RE VIEW IS FOUND NOT ALONE IN THOSE COLLEGES WHERE STUDENTS ARE DRAWN LARGELY FROM WESTERN RURAL DISTRICTS BUT IN THE OLD TRADITION BOUND COLLEGES OF THE EAST AS WELL IN FACT IT IS NOT UNCOM MON AMONG MEMBERS OF OUR COLLEGE FACULTIES IT IS A UNIVERSAL PRODUCT OF A NARROW SOCIAL EXPERIENCE UNDISCIPLINED EMOTIONS AND A CRAMPED INTELLECT THE RABID PARTISAN FAILS TO NOTE THAT HAD HE MATRICULATED IN A RURAL COLLEGE THE BLACK SHEEP OF HIS FANCY WOULD ALL HAVE BEEN WHITE AND THE LAMBS HE THINKS SO WHITE WOULD ALL HAVE BEEN BLACK THIS PROVINCIALISM IS A DRAG ON EVERY PHASE OF COLLEGE LIFE BUT IT IS CHIEFLY DANGEROUS TO ATHLETICS BECAUSE IT LENDS ITSELF TO BAD INFLUENCES UNSPORTSMANLIKE SUGGESTIONS AND THE SWAY OF MOB MIND II SECOND AMONG THE FACTORS THAT ARE CONSTANT IN THEIR TENDENCIES TOWARD CORRUPTION IS AN UNHEALTHY CRAVING TO WIN A CRAVING TO WIN IS NOT ONLY A NATURAL AND LEGITIMATE FEELING BUT IT UNDERLIES MANY OF THE MOST PLEASURABLE AND STIMULATING EMOTIONS AROUSED BY ATHLETICS IT BECOMES UNWHOLESOME OR DANGEROUS WHEN EXAGGERATED TO UNREASONABLE PROPORTIONS EITHER THROUGH A CONTAGIONOF LOCAL PRIDE OR THROUGH THE UNHEALTHY INTEREST AND INFLUENCE OF THE SPORTY AND BETTING ELEMENT WHICH SWAYED BY THE CRUDEST OF PASSIONS FEELS NOTHING KNOWS NOTHING AND CARES NOTHING FOR EDUCATIONAL AIMS OR SPORTSMANLIKE STANDARDS THIS IS THE ELEMENT THAT FORCED FACULTY CONTROL ATHLETICS ARE TO THEM A GAMBLING DEVICE THEIR IDEALS ARE FOCUSED IN ONE AIM WIN THEIR INTERESTS AND INFLUENCE ARE A CONSTANT MENACE TO HONORABLE ATHLETIC STANDARDS SO LONG AS COLLEGE AUTHORITIES ALLOW CHARACTERS THAT ARE A DISGRACE TO THE INSTITUTION THE PRIVI LEGES OF THE COLLEGE SO LONG WILL THERE BE AN UNSCRUPULOUS ELE MENT DEBAUCHING ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL INSTINCTS WHICH CREATE AND DEVELOP ATHLETIC CONTESTS A HEALTHY OVERARDENT CRAVING TO WIN IS SUBJECT TO EDUCATIONAL INFLUENCES THE UNHEALTHY WILL YIELD ONLY TO HARSH DISCIPLINE III ANOTHER FACTOR THAT TENDS TOWARD CORRUPTION IS THE COM PETITIVE SPIRIT NORMAL COMPETITION IS EAGERLY SOUGHT AND ENJOYED BY ATHLETES BUT THE CRAVING TENDS TO OVERLEAP ITSELF AND PRODUCE AN EXAGGERATED ATHLETICISM IT PRODUCES AN ACCU MULATION OF BIG INTERCOLLEGIATE GAMES THERE FOLLOWS A PROFOUND 330REGULATION OF A THLE ICS IN MISSOURI CONCENTRATION OF EFFORT ENORMOUS LABOR AND GREAT ABSORPTION OF TIME EVERYTHING BECOMES EXAGGERATED SURFEITED ATHLETES ARE WORKED UP TO A REALIZATION OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES THE HONOR OF THE COLLEGE ITS STANDING BEFORE THE WORLD THE NUMBER OF STU DENTS ALL DEPEND UPON THEIR EFFORTS UNDER THE STRAIN POWERFUL MEN ONLY CAN SURVIVE A PREMIUM IS PLACED ON SUCH MEN IT LEADS TO AN EXAGGERATED HEROWORSHIP OF THE POWERFUL EXPERT ATHLETE AND A CONTEMPT FOR THE UNDEVELOPED BOY WITH LATENT ATHLETIC POWERS THE ATHLETE HIMSELF GAINS AN EXAGGERATED NOTION OF HIS VALUE AND IMPORTANCE HE COMES TO EXPECT FAVORS AND THINKS HE IS ABUSED IF HE DOES NOT GET THEM NO ONE HONORS THE ATHLETE MORE THAN I BUT HE SHOULD BE HONORED WITHIN HIS OWN DOMAIN AND WITH SOME SENSE OF PROPORTION ATHLETIC SKILL IS NO GUARANTEE OF INTELLECTUAL CULTURE OR POWER AND IT IS VERY DOUBT FUL WHETHER THERE IS ANY RELATION BETWEEN THE PHYSICAL COURAGE EXHIBITED ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD AND THE MORAL COURAGE NECESSARY TO FIGHT FOR A MORAL PRINCIPLE IV THE TRANSIENT PROFESSIONAL COACH IS ANOTHER CONSTANT INFLUENCE TOWARD CORRUPTION HE IS THE MOST CORRUPTING INFLU ENCE IN COLLEGE ATHLETICS TODAY THE VERY NATURE OF HIS POSITION INDUCES MENTAL STATES THAT LEAD TO CORRUPT PRACTICES HE IS CREATED BY A DESIRE FOR A WINNING TEAM HIS REPUTATION DEPENDS ON THE PRODUCTION OF A WINNING TEAM SUCCESS IS REWARDED BY A SPEC TACULAR REPUTATION AND A RIDICULOUSLY LARGE SALARY THE TEMPTATION IS TOO MUCH FOR MORTAL FLESH AS VERY FEW COACHES HAVE ANY INTEREST POWER OR PATIENCE IN DEVELOPING THE RAW MATERIAL IN THE STUDENT BODY THEY BECOME ACTIVE AGENTS IN PRODUCING AND FOS TERING A RECRUITING SPIRIT IT IS ASTONISHING WITH WHAT UNANIMITY PRESENTDAY COACHES DEMAND FULLY DEVELOPED ATHLETIC MATERIAL THEY ARE INTERESTED IN THEIR OWN REPUTATIONS NOT IN THE COLLEGE THEIR INFLUENCE IS UNEDUCATIONAL IF NOT ANTIEDUCATIONAL THE GREATER THEIR REPUTATIONS THE MORE DANGEROUS THEY BECOME V LAST BUT NOT LEAST IN IMPORTANCE AMONG THE FACTORS THAT LEAD TO CORRUPTION IS AN APATHETIC DISINTERESTED CARELESS OR DIS HONEST FACULTY GIVEN THIS ATTITUDE ON THE PART OF THE FACULTY AND INFLUENCES OF ALL THE OTHER FACTORS ARE WITHOUT CHECK IN FACT THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF ATHLETIC CONTROL COMES BACK TO THE MORAL 33ITHE SCHOOL REVIEW RESPONSIBILITY OF THE FACULTY ANY COLLEGE WHERE THE FACULTY BELIEVES THAT ITS WORK BEGINS AND ENDS IN THE CLASSROOM WILL BE DISGRACED BY CORRUPT PRACTICES THIS MAY BE LAID DOWN AS A GEN ERAL PRINCIPLE EITHER THE ADMINISTRATIVE HEADS OF THE COLLEGE THE FACULTY OR SOME INDIVIDUAL MEMBER OF THE FACULTY GIFTED WITH A GENEROUS AMOUNT OF MORAL COURAGE AND SELFSACRIFICE BACKED BY EITHER THE SYMPATHY OF THE ADMINISTRATION OR THE FACULTY MUST TAKE UP THE THANKLESS BURDEN OF ATHLETIC REGULATION AND CONTROL THERE PROBABLY NEVER HAS BEEN A CASE WHERE THE WHOLE FACULTY OF A COLLEGE HAS BEEN TOLERANT OF DISHONEST PRACTICES IN ATHLETICS BUT CASES ARE NOT UNCOMMON WHERE THE ATTITUDE OF THE FACULTY MAKES ANYTHING OR EVERYTHING POSSIBLE UNFORTUNATELY SOME MEMBERS OF OUR COLLEGE FACULTIES ARE MEN OF NEITHER HIGH MORAL JUDGMENT NOR HIGH MORAL COURAGE ON THE ONE HAND WE HAVE THOUGH TO BE SURE BUT SELDOM THE FANATICAL FOOL WHOSE PREJUDICE REIGNS ABOVE HIS SENSE OF JUSTICE IN HIS ATTITUDE TOWARD THE ATHLETE ON THE OTHER HAND WE HAVE ALL TOO OFTEN THE ATTITUDE THAT LOWERS COLLEGE STANDARDS FOR THE ATHLETE IN OBEDIENCE TO THE POPULAR DEMAND FOR A WINNING TEAM THIS IS BAD ENOUGH FOR THE ORDINARY COLLEGE PROFESSOR BUT WHEN THE ADMINISTRATIVE HEADS OF A COLLEGE FOR THE SAKE OF THE ADVERTISING VALUE OF A WINNING TEAM WINK AT THE PRESENCE OF AN ATHLETE WHOSE INTELLIGENCE AND SCHOLARSHIP ARE A DISGRACE TO THE SCHOLARLY STANDARDS OF THE INSTITUTION IT IS NOT ONLY DISHONORABLE BUT LOWBRED THESE FIVE INFLUENCES WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED AS FACTORS CON STANT IN THEIR TENDENCIES TO CORRUPTION CULMINATE UNLESS COUNTER ACTED BY OTHER INFLUENCES IN THOSE PRACTICES WHICH WE SO MUCH DEPLORE AMONG THESE THE TWO MOST PROMINENT BEFORE THE COLLEGE WORLD AT THE PRESENT TIME ARE FIRST UNSPORTSMANLIKE FEELINGS AND CONDUCT TOWARD OPPONENTS SECOND CORRUPT FEELINGS AND PRACTICES CONCERNING THE USE OF ILLEGITIMATE PLAYERS BOTH OF THESE HEADINGS ARE DESERVING OF LENGTHY DISCUSSION BUT TIME ALLOWS ME BUT A FEW WORDS CONCERNING WHAT I CONSIDER THE MOST VICIOUS AND FARREACHING OF ALL THE CORRUPTING PRACTICES IN COLLEGE ATHLETICS I E THE RECRUITING SYSTEM THE PRACTICE OF RECRUITING ATHLETICS HAS BEEN OF LONG DURATION BUT THE PRESENT SUBTLE AND INSIDIOUS SYSTEMATIC ORGANIZATION OF METHODS FOR SECURING ATHLETES 332REGULA TION OF A THLETICS IN MISSOURI APPARENTLY BEYOND THE REACH OF FACULTY AUTHORITIES MAKES THIS EVIL THE DOMINANT MENACING EVIL OF COLLEGE ATHLETICS IT IS THE MOST VICIOUS AND FARREACHING OF ALL THE CORRUPTING PRACTICES IN ATHLETICS RECENTLY I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO COLLECT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE EXTENT AND MORAL INFLUENCES OF THIS SYSTEM THE INVESTIGA TION THOUGH SCARCELY BEGUN REVEALS CONDITIONS THAT ARE APPALLING THE MATERIAL INDICATES CLEARLY THAT THERE ARE MANY WELLDEFINED CASES WHERE ATHLETES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER COLLEGES AND TAKE PART IN ATHLETICS THROUGH INFLUENCES OF THE FOLLOWING CHAR ACTER I CASES WHERE PLEAS CONCERNING THE STANDING OF THE COLLEGE THE ADVANTAGES OF ITS ENVIRONMENT THE PROMINENCE OF ITS ATHLETICS WERE MADE 2 CASES WHERE ATHLETES WERE BANQUETED AND FLATTERED BY ATTEN TIONS IN ORDER TO INDUCE THEM TO ENTER A PARTICULAR COLLEGE 3 CASES WHERE RAILROAD FARE OR A TICKET TO THE COLLEGE TOWN WAS OFFERED 4 CASES WHERE A POSITION THAT WOULD PAY EXPENSES WAS PROMISED OR GIVEN 5 CASES WHERE A SALARY FOR WORK THAT EXISTED IN NAME ONLY WAS PROMISED OR GIVEN 6 CASES WHERE EXPENSES IN COLLEGES WERE PROMISED OR GIVEN 7 CASES WHERE DONATIONS OR A FIXED SUM OF MONEY OR A SALARY WERE OFFERED OR GIVEN WHILE IT IS VERY HARD FOR COLLEGE AUTHORITIES TO GET EVIDENCE THAT WILL CONVICT ALMOST EVERYONE CONNECTED INTIMATELY WITH ATHLETICS KNOWS OF CASES THAT ILLUSTRATE THE METHODS JUST ENU MERATED IN THIS CONNECTION THE FOLLOWING LETTERS WILL BE OF INTEREST NAMES AND ADDRESSES

HEIGHT 5 FT 7 IN THESE LETTERS ARE BUT SAMPLES THEY SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES DOUBTLESS THERE ARE NUMEROUS WILD RUMORS AND EXAGGERATED TALES CONCERNING THE PRACTICES OF PARTICULAR COLLEGES AND THE GOLDEN OPPORTUNITIES OFFERED THE EXPERT ATHLETE BUT IF WE HAD NO PROOFS THE VOLUMES OF SMOKE INDICATE THAT THERE IS SOME FIRE THE PITIABLE MENTAL CONDITION OF THOSE ATHLETES WHO LIVE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF GREAT ATHLETIC CENTERS IS PROOF IN ITSELF OF THE PRESENCE AND DEBAUCHING INFLUENCE OF THE RECRUITING SYSTEM MANY ARE THE COMPLAINTS THAT COLLEGE ATHLETICS HAVE BECOME A BUSINESS IN WHICH WINNING OUT AT ANY COST IS THE CHIEF END IN WHICH THE SPIRIT OF COMMERCIALISM IS DOMINANT DISAPPROVAL IS SWAMPED IN A GROWING CONVICTION THAT RECRUITING IS ESSENTIAL IN ORDER TO MAKE A RESPECTABLE SHOWING AMONG ENTHUSIASTS THE ALLABSORBING TOPIC OF CONVERSATION IS THE NATURE OF THE MATERIAL AND THE CHANCES TO WIN THE NEGOTIA TIONS OF THE MANAGEMENT FOR A COACH ARE RIFE WITH SUCH QUERIES AS WHAT SORT OF MATERIAL HAVE YOU  WHAT HAVE YOU DONE 335THE SCHOOL REVIEW TO GET GOOD MATERIAL  THE TEMPER OF THE ATHLETICALLY INCLINED IS ELATED OR DEPRESSED ACCORDING TO THE INVENTORY OF CRACK ATH LETES ON HAND MY DATA SHOW CLEARLY THAT THE RECRUITING SYSTEM HAS PRODUCED A WIDESPREAD CONVICTION AMONG STUDENTS THAT ATHLETIC POWER IS A VERY DESIRABLE ACQUISITION THAT IT AT LEAST INSURES A GOOD TIME EASY WORK PROMINENCE AND WHERE NECESSARY ENABLES THE ATHLETE TO GET AN EDUCATION WITHOUT COST TO HIMSELF THERE IS SCARCELY AN ATHLETE OF ANY PROMINENCE IN THE SOUTHWEST WHO DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT HIS ATHLETIC ABILITY WOULD NET HIM HANDSOME RETURNS IN ANY OF THE GREAT NORTHERN OR EASTERN COLLEGES JUST IMAGINE IF YOU DO NOT ACTUALLY KNOW THE MORAL RESULTS OF SUCH A NOTION IT WOULD SEEM THAT STUDENTS ALUMNI MANAGERS CAPTAINS AND COACHES INTOXICATED BY AN EXAGGERATED ENTHUSIASM AND A PASSION TO WIN HAVE GONE MAD IN A GLUTTONOUS SEARCH FOR MATERIAL APART FROM ITS CORRUPTING INFLUENCE THE RECRUITING SYSTEM AS A POLICY IS ABSOLUTELY ANTIEDUCATIONAL IT IS DESTRUCTIVE OF REAL INTERNAL ATHLETIC DEVELOPMENT IT DISCOURAGES ALL EFFORT TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LATENT ATHLETIC ABILITY OF UNDERGRADUATES IT FORCES FURTHER RECRUITING SURVEY THE MEMBERS OF ALMOST ANY COLLEGE TEAM THAT JUMPS TO SUDDEN PROMINENCE WHAT PROPORTION OF ITS MEMBERS ARE DEVELOPED FROM THE RANKS OF THE STUDENT BODY WHAT PROPORTION ARE READYMADE ATHLETES FROM OTHER SOURCES  PRESIDENT JORDAN RECENTLY SAID I FEAR FOOTBALL HAS OUT GROWN ITS USEFULNESS THIS SEEMS TO BE THE GROWING SENTIMENT AMONG THE LEADING COLLEGE MEN THAT HAVE SUPPORTED ATHLETICS THEY HAVE SUPPORTED FOOTBALL IN COMMON WITH OTHER PHASES OF ATHLETICS BECAUSE OF THEIR VALUE TO YOUNG MEN RECENTLY THEY HAVE UTTERED NOTHING BUT COMPLAINTS LOSE THEIR SUPPORT AND THE DAYS OF FOOTBALL PROSPERITY ARE NUMBERED FACE TO FACE WITH THIS DEMORALIZING AND RUINOUS INFLUENCE WE MAY WELL ASK WHAT IS TO BE DONE ARE WE TO RESORT TO FURTHER RULEMAKING PERSONALLY I BELIEVE THAT TECHNICAL LEGISLATION ON RULES OF ELIGIBILITY HAS ABOUT REACHED ITS LIMIT OF USEFULNESS THERE ARE ONE OR TWO RULES THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL BUT IT IS A SERIOUS COMMENTARY ON THE MOTIVES AT WORK IN ATHLETICS THAT WE 336REGULATION OF ATHLETICS IN MISSOURI HAVE HAD FORCED UPON US ALREADY SO MANY RULES WHAT IS NEEDED IS A CHANGE OF HEART IN THE APPLICATION OF THESE RULES WE NEED TO APPLY OUR RULES FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE RIVAL COL LEGE THE WORLD SHOULD KNOW THAT THE HONOR OF THE INSTITUTION IS TO BE PLACED ABOVE THE RIGHT OF ANY INDIVIDUAL TO TAKE PART IN INTERCOLLEGIATE CONTESTS HOW DIFFERENT IS THIS STANDPOINT FROM THE ONE USUALLY ADOPTED YET IT WOULD DO AWAY WITH THE FREQUENT DISGRACEFUL INTERCOLLEGIATE SQUABBLES OVER THE ELIGIBILITY OF PLAYERS FURTHER IT WOULD DIMINISH THOSE RUMORS THAT ARE NOW A CORRUPT ING INFLUENCE IN THEMSELVES THE APPLICATION OF RULES OF ELIGIBILITY HOWEVER NO MATTER HOW CONSCIENTIOUSLY AND GENEROUSLY INTERPRETED WILL NOT SUFFICE TO ERADICATE THE BANEFUL PRACTICES NOW DOMINATING ATHLETICS WE MUST CHANGE OUR ATTACK AND STRIKE AT THE FACTORS CONSTANT IN THEIR TENDENCY TO PRODUCE THOSE PRACTICES I AMONG THE FACTORS THAT ARE CONSTANT IN THEIR INFLUENCES FOR CORRUPTIONS THE PROFESSIONAL COACH STANDS IN A CLASS BY HIMSELF HIS EDUCATIONAL POSITION IS ANOMALOUS HE IS THE CENTER IN WHICH THROUGH WHICH AND AROUND WHICH ALL THE OTHER BANEFUL INFLUENCES ARE ROUSED AND OPERATED THERE IS ONLY ONE THING TO DO WITH HIM AND THAT IS ELIMINATE HIM II ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROFESSIONAL COACH ARE THOSE DIS HONEST STUDENTS ALUMNI AND SYMPATHIZERS WHO DOMINATED BY AN UNHEALTHY CRAVING TO WIN RESORT TO SUCH SUBTLE METHODS IN THE RECRUITING OF EXPERT ATHLETES THAT THEY ARE THE DESPAIR OF FACULTY COMMITTEES ON ATHLETICS UNFORTUNATELY ALL OF THIS ELEMENT CAN NOT BE ELIMINATED I HAVE OFTEN BEEN ASKED HOW CAN YOU FIND OUT WHAT IS DONE BY THESE PEOPLE THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO REACH THE DISHONEST ELEMENT AND THAT IS LET THE POLICY TOWARD RECRUITING ATHLETES BE WELL UNDERSTOOD AND THEN MAKE ANY EFFORT AT RECRUITING UNSAFE BY COMPELLING EACH CANDIDATE FOR A TEAM TO SIGN A CERTIFICATE SO SEARCHING IN ITS CHARACTER THAT IT WILL BE HARD FOR ANY IRREGULARITY TO ESCAPE DETECTION THE FOLLOWING CERTIFICATE SEEMS TO ME TO BE PREGNANT WITH POSSIBILITIES FOR THE DISCOURAGEMENT OF RECRUITING AGENTS AND METHODS 337THE SCHOOL REVIEW

ELIGIBLE ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT AND LETTER OF THE RULES ADOPTED BY MISSOURI UNIVERSITY SIGNED TO THE BEST OF MY BELIEF AND KNOWLEDGE I CERTIFY THAT THE ABOVE IS COR RECT CAPTAIN OF TEAM MANAGER OF TEAMTHE SCHOOL REVIEW BACK THIS CERTIFICATE BY A WELLENFORCED RULE SUCH AS THAT STATED AT THE HEAD OF THE CERTIFICATE AND THE DISCIPLINE OF THE INSTITUTION MUST BE LAX INDEED AND THE CHARACTER OF THE STUDENTS VERY LOW IF IT DOES NOT PLACE THE SITUATION WELL WITHIN THE HANDS OF A VIGOROUS COMMITTEEMAN NO COLLEGE HAS A RIGHT TO USE AN ATHLETE WITHOUT INVESTIGATING HIS CAREER THE COOPERATION OF OTHER COLLEGES SHOULD BE ASKED AN INVESTIGATION AND VIGOROUS CROSSQUESTIONING SHOULD HANDLE THE MOST STUBBORN CASE IF THERE ARE SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING AN ATHLETES CAREER HE SHOULD BE DISQUALIFIED III MANY OF THE CORRUPTING INFLUENCES IN ATHLETICS ARE SUBJECT TO AND WILL YIELD TO THE EDUCATIONAL INFLUENCES AND DISCIPLINE OF THE FACULTY THIS IS TRUE OF THOSE INFLUENCES THAT ARE DUE TO CRUDENESS IGNORANCE PREJUDICE UNDISCIPLINED ENTHUSIASM OR CHAGRININ FACT ALL THOSE FACTORS WHICH I HAVE CLASSED UNDER THE HEAD OF PROVINCIALISM EXAGGERATED ATHLETICISM AS WELL AS THE REPRESENTATIVE NORMAL STUDENT CRAVING TO WIN THE ROUGHER CRUDER ELEMENT NEEDS THE INFLUENCE OF DISCIPLINE BUT THE MAJORITY OF COLLEGE STUDENTS WILL FOLLOW AN APPEAL FOR HIGH STANDARDS GENEROUS SPORTSMANSHIP AND MANLY CONDUCT AT A RECENT MEETING OF ATHLETIC REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE LEAD ING COLLEGES IN MISSOURI CALLED TO DISCUSS THE ATHLETIC SITUATION SEVEN RESOLUTIONS WERE ADOPTED THE FIRST THREE OF WHICH WERE AS FOLLOWS I RESOLVED THAT IT IS THE CONVICTION OF THIS CONFERENCE THAT ALL COLLEGE ATHLETICS SHOULD BE UNDER THE CONTROL AND SUPERVISION OF THE COLLEGE FACULTY THAT THE FACULTY AUTHORITIES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE STANDARDS MAINTAINED IN ATHLETICS SHOULD INSTRUCT THE GENERAL STUDENT BODY AS WELL AS CANDIDATES FOR TEAMS IN THE PRINCIPLES OF GOOD SPORTSMANSHIP AND MANLY CONDUCT IN THEIR ATHLETIC ACTIVITY AND THAT PENALTIES BE IMPOSED UPON PLAYERS WHO IN ANY WAY RESORT TO UNFAIR TACTICS IN A CONTEST OR MAKE THEMSELVES OBNOXIOUS WHILE CON NECTED WITH THE TEAM 2 RESOLVED THAT IN EVERY COLLEGE COMMUNITY A PUBLIC OPINION SHOULD BE FOSTERED WHICH SHALL BE ABSOLUTELY FAIR AND COURTEOUS TO VISITING TEAMS WHICH SHALL BE PROMPT TO RECOGNIZE AND APPLAUD GOOD PLAYS AND ACTS OF CHIVALRY ON EITHER SIDE AND WHICH NEVER DROPS BELOW THE PLANE OF CONSIDERATE AND GENTLE MANLY CONDUCT 3 RESOLVED THAT THE AUTHORITIES OF EACH COLLEGE DISCOUNTENANCE BETTING IN CONNECTION WITH ATHLETIC EVENTS AND ENDEAVOR TO BUILD UP A PUBLIC SENTI MENT AGAINST THIS BANEFUL EVIL 340REGULATION OF ATHLETICS IN MISSOURI I BELIEVE THESE RESOLUTIONS CONTAIN HOPEFUL SUGGESTIONS FOR A FUTURE LINE OF ACTION IN THE CONTROL OF ATHLETICS THAT THEIR SPIRIT AS WELL AS THE SUGGESTIONS CONCERNING METHODS ARE CAPABLE OF PRACTICAL APPLICATION WE HAVE FULLY DEMONSTRATED BY RESULTS ACCOMPLISHED IN MISSOURI UNIVERSITY IF THE INTENT OF THESE RESOLUTIONS IS WISE THEY INDICATE A NEED IN COLLEGE LIFE OF SOME ORGANIZED EDUCATIONAL WORK IN STUDENT AFFAIRS WALTER CAMP IN A PRIVATE CONVERSATION SUGGESTED THIS NEED SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHY NOT GIVE OFFICIAL RECOGNITION TO THE LITERARY DEBATING DRAMATIC MUSICAL AND ATHLETIC ACTIVITIES OF STUDENTS AS A PART OF THEIR COLLEGE CAREER  PLACE THEM UNDER THE DIRECTION OF A SECRETARY OR DIRECTOR OR DEAN OF STUDENT ACTIVITIES WHO SHALL BE CHARGED WITH THE CONTROL OF STUDENT AFFAIRS AND ORGANIZE EDUCATIONAL WORK ALONG THE LINES SUGGESTED BY THE RESOLUTIONS JUST READ THESE SUGGESTIONS FOR THE CONTROL SUPPRESSION OR ELIMINATION OF CORRUPTING CHARACTERS IN THE COLLEGE COMMUNITY AND THE EDU CATION OF THE STUDENT BODY IN STANDARDS OF SPORTSMANSHIP WILL RID ATHLETICS OF ALL THESE CORRUPTING FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE JUST IN PROPORTION TO THE EFFICIENCY OF THE FACULTY IN ITS WORK CAN WE NOT GO FARTHER AND ESTABLISH PRINCIPLES THAT WILL TEND TO SECURE THE EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF COLLEGE ATHLETICS AS WEL1 AS DICTATE METHODS FOR THE LEGITIMATE DEVELOPMENT OF ATHLETICS AS A SPORT IF COMPETITIVE ATHLETICS ARE TO REMAIN A PERMANENT PHASE OF COLLEGE STUDENT LIFE THEY MUST BE ORGANIZED AND CON DUCTED IN HARMONY WITH THE BROADER EDUCATIONAL AIMS OF THE COL LEGE THE CRAVING TO PARTICIPATE IN ATHLETICS THE CRAVING TO WIN AND THE PLEASURES IN HIGHLY DEVELOPED EXPERT ATHLETIC PERFORM ANCES ARE NORMAL AND HEALTHFUL AND SHOULD HAVE LEGITIMATE EXPRESSION CAN A CRITERION BE ESTABLISHED MAKING THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN CORRUPT PRACTICES AND LEGITIMATE PRACTICES IN DEVELOPING A WIN NING TEAM AS CLEARCUT AS THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN PROFESSIONAL AND AMATEUR  IF COLLEGE ATHLETICS HAVE A VALUE FOR COLLEGE MEN IF THEY HAVE A PLACE AMONG OR ASSOCIATED WITH THE COLLEGE DUTIES OF THE STUDENTS THAT VALUE IS FOR THE UNDERGRADUATE THEREFORE I ASK WILL NOT THIS SERVE AS THE CRITERION SOUGHT ANY INFLU 34ITHE SCHOOL REVIEW ENCE THAT BARS OR TENDS TO DISCOURAGE THE AVERAGE UNDERGRADUATE FROM PARTICIPATION IN ATHLETIC SPORTS IS A CORRUPTING RUINOUS AND PROFESSIONALIZING POLICY BECAUSE ITS LOGICAL END IS HIRED MEN THIS PRINCIPLE LOGICALLY APPLIED WOULD ITSELF REVOLUTIONIZE PRESENTDAY ATHLETIC METHODS IN THE FIRST PLACE IT WOULD DIC TATE A SUPPRESSION OF THE RECRUITING SYSTEM IN THE SECOND PLACE IT WOULD DICTATE VERY STRINGENT RULES AGAINST THE GRADUATE PLAYER OR ELIMINATE HIM IN THE THIRD PLACE IT WOULD DICTATE AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE PROFESSIONAL COACH A PERMANENT IHSTRUCTING HEAD OR BODY THAT COULD SYSTEMATICALLY ORGANIZE THE DEVELOP MENT OF LATENT ATHLETIC TALENT LASTLY IT WOULD TEND TO PLACE ATHLETICS UNDER THEIR NORMAL AND MOST HEALTHFUL AUSPICES AS A PHASE OF THE DEPARTMENT WORK IN PHYSICAL TRAINING THE DEPART MENT ORGANIZATION OF ATHLETICS SECURES THEIR EDUCATIONAL VALUE TO A LARGE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WORKING AT A NORMAL INTENSITY AS AGAINST A FEW WORKING AT AN ABNORMAL INTENSITY FROM EXPERI ENCES IN MISSOURI WE FEEL THAT THIS IS THE ULTIMATE METHOD OF SOLUTION FOR ALL THE PROBLEMS IN COMPETITIVE ATHLETICS AS A LAST WORD I WISH TO SAY THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MORAL CONDITION IN ATHLETICS RESTS ON THE LEADING COLLEGE OR COL LEGES IN ANY COMMUNITY THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ATHLETIC MORALITY IN MISSOURI RESTS LARGELY WITH THE STATE UNIVERSITY THE RESPONSI BILITY FOR ATHLETICS IN THE MIDDLE WEST RESTS LARGELY WITH MICHIGAN CHICAGO AND WISCONSIN UNLESS THESE THREE INSTITUTIONS HANDLE THEIR ATHLETICS BY METHODS THAT ARE ABOVE REPROACH EVERY IRREGU LARITY OR RUMOR OF IRREGULARITY WILL BE DUPLICATED IN A SERIES OF REVERBERATIONS FROM LESSER COLLEGES MORAL RESPONSIBILITY NEVER FAILS TO COME HOME TO ITS OWN C W HETHERINGTON UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI 342

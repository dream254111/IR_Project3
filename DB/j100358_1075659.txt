j100358,The School Review,1075659,A Modern Roman State,i244584,A MODERN ROMAN STATE MASON D GRAY Department of Latin and Greek East High School Rochester During the past three years an interesting experiment has been going on in the East High School of Rochester N Y and its com plete success has well repaid the time and effort devoted to it We have reproduced as completely and accurately as a limited number of pupils would permit the ancient Roman political organization with its attendant campaign and election The experiment was the result of an effort to find some aspect of Roman life into which the pupils in Latin can at once apprecia tively and sympathetically enter Unquestionably one of the chief obstacles in the study of Latin has been the utterly strange and foreign atmosphere into which the pupil is plunged on the first day he takes up the subject and which he usually continues to breathe so long as he studies it This feeling of unreality the belief he unconsciously acquires that the Romans were an unnatural people quite distinct from the type he sees about him talking in long periods on subjects quite outside his natural everyday interests in a language artificial and difficult destroys all possibility of real personal interest and consequently of securing the best results from the study It is our aim to have every pupil upon beginning Latin become a member of a Roman state and to create an atmosphere in which Latin is the natural means of expression We may give illustrated lectures on the private life of the Romans but this while excellent so far as it goes does not bridge the gap between the mind of a fourteenyearold boy or girl of 19o6 A D and the civilization of Rome two thousand years ago Pupils are assur edly interested in such lectures but it is the same antiquarian interest that they might feel in some extinct species of mankind of which curi ous traces have been found and not the live personal interest that should accompany the study of the language of those Romans whose works occupy such prominence in their education 296A MODERN ROMAN STATE 297 Descriptions of Roman life are enlightening only provided the student has already found some door by which he can really enter into the spirit of ancient life no matter in what phase Interest ex cited by pictures is external and superficial unless significance is given them by some common bond already existing and joining the active real life of an American boy with the no less active and real life of the Romans Reproductions of Roman plays trials festivals etc however valuable and interesting in themselves are by their nature only occasional and affect directly but a small proportion of pupils while the remainder are passive spectators in whom curiosity is usually the predominent feeling What I have been searching for is an interest both continuous and selfsustaining and which can by its continuity give background and coherence to other interests by themselves isolated or spasmodic and be the natural source from which they spring Now by the very nature of the government under which we grow up by the familiarity and instinctive interest felt by every American boy or girl in elections and politics it seems as if the political phase of Roman life would be the first to suggest itself as readily compre hensible and naturally interesting That our Roman election has excited just that interest will be readily apparent to any visitor at the East High School When anything connected with their study of Latin so arouses their interest that rival parties hold mass meetings attended spontaneously by half the Latin pupils at the same time when pupils busy themselves writing in Latin the political plat forms of the recreated ancient parties when blackboard space and wall space in corridors and assembly hall is at a premium for the posting of Latin inscriptions in support of one candidate or another when the display of the colors of opposing parties rivals the school colors even in the height of football enthusiasm we can feel assured that in the political contests of ancient Rome has been found the common bond of interest for which we were searching In the following pages I shall describe in detail the organization of the state the campaign the election and the functions of the officials It must be borne in mind that in the actual conduct of the state these several aspects are inseparable The intricate political298 THE SCHOOL REVIEW system is brought into existence through the interest and excitement of the campaign while the functions of the officials are illustrated at every stage of the proceedings The election itself is the central point of interest during the year exhibiting vividly as it does all the machinery of government in actual operation forming a climax in which culminates the strenuous party rivalry of the preceding cam paign and affording opportunity for practical illustration of the most important duties of the state officials The organization here described is the developed and permanent form reached in the third year of our state Each year has required a complete reorganization owing to the addition of pupils not pre viously included but now every Latin pupil is a member of the state and no further changes will be needed except such as are due to the annual graduation of one class and the entrance of another I shall describe the procedure of this year where we made constant use of the officials elected the previous year by the smaller state There are about twelve hundred pupils in the school of whom eight hundred and fifty study Latin Midyear graduation is in operation producing eight grades of Latin work designated as Latin term Latin final  Caesar term  Caesar final  Cicero term etc and forming in all twentynine sections The first step in the organization of our Roman state was the creation of trade guilds collegia opificum Each of the twentynine sections repre sents one of the following collegia assigned by lot agricolae marketgardeners aliari garlicdealers aurifices goldsmiths caupones innkeepers cisiarii coachmen clibanarii confectioners coeparii grocers cornicines

fluteblowers tonsores barbers unguentarii druggists vestiarii tailorsA MODERN ROMAN STATE 299 Each collegium selects from its members a princeps or president who in turn appoints four magistri or masterworkmen The re mainder are discentes or apprentices The room in which they recite becomes their curia or local place of assembly and other related ideas are gradually introduced such as the drawingup of rules of membership the choice of a patron deity and of a Roman patronus The idea that vast numbers of Roman citizens were laboringmen organized in labor unions living their lives as naturally as do their modern representatives comes as a gratifying surprise to the average pupil and forms a welcome corrective of the unfortunate impression made by the vocabulary of his firstyear book and intensified by the texts read later that the Romans were a curious and ethereal people spending their lives in attacking towns making speeches attending banquets and watching games And when he learns that the guild of carpenters jabri of musicians cornicines and others antedate the Roman Republic and even history he gains a new idea of the antiquity of these institutions and their accompanying problems The pupils are expected to learn the names of a number of the guilds especially of those meeting in their curia and to understand in gen eral their organization and purposes the result of which is a good conception of the condition of labor in ancient Rome and of the extent to which division of labor existed Prose work of a much more natural type and of much greater inherent interest than the usual stereotyped form can easily be devised thus giving the whole a unity of purpose and attaching it directly to the daily progress of the pupil While the ancient collegia were not strictly political in their nature their active participation in the elections makes the introduction of them into our state highly desirable and their convenience as instruments for organizing the state itself makes them indispensable Much stress was placed on the selection of energetic principes of executive ability and they assumed the burden of forming the state Each princeps assisted by his magistri assigned to every member of his collegium a Roman name with its three parts To the Vergil classes were assigned the names of the chief writers living with few exceptions from about 133 B C down to Augustus Following is the list selected though numerous additions can be readily made300 THE SCHOOL REVIEW L Livius Andronicus Cn Naevius T Maccius Plautus Q Ennius M Pacuvius P Terentius Afer

Q Horatius Flaccus A Albius Tibullus Sex Propertius P Ovidius Naso T Livius M Vitruvius Pollio M Tullius Tiro T Pomponius Atticus To the Cicero classes are assigned the names of the prominent

Triumvir C Julius Caesar Octavianus M Vipsanius Agrippa Beginning Latin pupils were assigned any of the above names indiscriminately The concrete individual name once learned is made a basis for an explanation of the Roman name incomparably clearer than any other could possibly be Each pupil retains his name for a year and is expected to investigate the life of the man whose name he bears to learn the names of some of his classmates and thus gradually to become acquainted with the names and deeds of the men of the period selected the last century of the republic This period was chosen because it is in comparison with preced ing centuries preeminently a study of individual lives The differ entiation into three classesmilitary political and literaryis not introduced till the second year both because this division is made natural only by the characteristics peculiar to the texts read in the last three years and because it was thought sufficient to secure in this field during the first year merely a clear understanding of the forma tion and significance of the name itself with some familiarity with the names of those in the same class postponing till the second year the study of the individual lives Some very good papers purport ing to be letters or speeches have been written by thirdand fourthyear pupils describing their own lives in the first person with numerous references humorous and otherwise to their contem poraries In these papers pupils have carefully followed the main lines as prescribed by such facts as are known but within these limits have given their imagination free rein We are gradually pre paring tables of references to our library by which this idea can be more easily developed and the pupils introduced into a field of valuable and interesting reading It follows that since the lists of names are limited several must bear the same name but they are never in the same class and as they are furthermore always as signed to different tribes the full official names of five parts are all different Pupils are encouraged to use their Latin names in address ing one anothera habit no less valuable because it is regarded as a302 THE SCHOOL REVIEW joke The declension of the name and of numerous words related theretowomen gens familia stirps etcforms a group of para digms in which they take a greater interest since their significance appeals to them directly When the pupils have received their Latin names they are classi fied as citizens either by birth by naturalization or by manumission with the largest number in the first class This classification forms the basis for an account of Roman society immediately intelligible to each pupil and supplementary to what he learned from the col legium The pupil is then successively enrolled in the four great political units of curia tribus classis and centuria on the basis respectively of birth geography wealth and age Birth is represented by scholarship and on that basis each pupil is made a patrician or plebeian Of our eight hundred and fifty citizens ninety are patriciansa number chosen to secure a multiple of three the number of patrician tribes and of thirty the number of curiae in these tribes These ninety patricians are divided into the three tribes of Luceres Ramnes and Tities and each tribe of thirty patricians into ten curiae to which the ancient names so far as they are known are assigned Each curia elects its curio and the thirty curiones a curio maximus They assemble in this form as a comitia curiata and after the election confer the imperium by a formal act upon the officials chosen by the popular assemblies It is thus the earlier form of the comitia curiata composed solely of patricians and wielding a really effective power of ratification that we have adopted The list of ninety patricians is revised and published every year by the censor after conferring with the various instructors It is so arranged that the proportion of patricians increases from one in twentyfive in each beginning Latin class to one in three in each Vergil final class The division into five classes on the basis of wealth is represented by the division into several grades on the basis of year The Vergil classes represent the prima classis the Cicero classes the secunda classis the Caesar classes the tertia classis the Latin final classes the quarta classis the Latin term classes the quinta classis Care must be taken that there are at least seventy pupils in each diA MODERN ROMAN STATE 303 vision Of the Vergil classes the Vergil final section represents the Equites Romani equo publico while a small section of beginning pupils represents the capite censi a class below the quinta The arrangement was made in such a way that the size of the classes increased as the property requirement decreased Property to a def inite amount is assigned to each citizen within the limits prescribed for his classis as follows Equites Ioooooo asses     20ooo First class xooooo asses             2000 Second class 750oo asses  x1500 Third class 50000 asses             Iooo Fourth class 25000 asses   500 Fifth class 1500 asses     33 Capite censi below  33 The natural division of Roman citizens into centuriae of juniores and seniores on the basis of age is represented by the division into boys and girls the latter forming centuriae of juniores seventeen to fortyfive years of age and the former the centuriae of seniores fortyfive to sixty For the fourth division into thirtyfive tribes on a basis more or less geographical there could be no natural representative for each tribe must contain both juniores and seniores from all five classes To secure this result and at the same time to equalize the numbers in the tribes the several principes were instructed to begin at different points in the alphabetical lists of tribes and assign one boy and one girl to each tribe in order until the collegium was exhausted This process insured the formation of thirtyfive tribes each composed of from twenty to thirty members comprising representatives from each of the five classes and equally divided between juniores and seniores As soon as a pupil received his tribal assignment he incor porated in his name the abbreviated name of his tribe as follows Aem Cor Mae Pom Stel Cam Fal Pal Rom Tro Ani Lem Pol Ser Vot Cla Esq Men Pup Sub Col

occasional question will secure during the first year considerable knowledge of Italian geog raphy and where the ancient town possesses sufficient historic interest pupils are encouraged to study its history and find out what remains of it have been found The tribal and municipal assignments are permanent for the four years of the highschool course Each pupil is now in possession of such facts concerning himself as are necessary to direct his political activities and at the completion of the last step he is presented with a card summarizing them all NOMEN FORMALE P Sulpicius P b Aem Rufus

CENTURIA Senior 52 ANNOS NATUS CENTURIO COLLEGIUM Culinarii PRINCEPS T Pomponius Atticus When the citizens have thoroughly mastered their political status in curia tribe class and centuria the various political assembliesA MODERN ROMAN STATE 305 based upon them are organized The comitia curiata has already been mentionedbut as its functions are the least important of alland its organization might confuse the pupils it was postponed to the last The comitia centuriata was organized on the reformed tribal basis with eighteen centuriae of equites seventy centuriae in each of the five classes and five extra centuriae of cornicines tibicines fabri accensi proletarii known collectively as capite censi making three hundred and seventythree in all The comitia meets in the assembly hall with the equites in the first rows separated from the prima classis by a vacant row and the prima from the secunda etc A perfect picture of such an assembly and of the conditions it represents may be left in the minds of the pupils by causing the various classes to rise in succession Many centuriae especially those of the prima classis consist of but one citizen who in that case is the centurio also Where the centuria consists of two or more a centurio is chosen and the three hundred and seventythree centuriones present a clear objectlesson in the method of voting in this assembly where each centuria casts one vote through its centurio The assembly thus organized is presided over by thosd officials competent to do so and its functions are illustrated by the business brought before it Each year the pupil as his property increases will advance till he reaches the seats assigned to the equites I adopt the view of two tribal assembliesthe comitia tributa com posed of patricians and plebeians and the concilium plebis tributum composed solely of plebeians The former organizes first The aediles upon whom such a duty naturally falls carefully plotted the assem bly hall and assigned to each tribe an exact and permanent location After the evolution had been practiced once or twice five minutes proved sufficient to change from a comitia centuriata to a comitia trib uta with each of the thirtyfive tribes isolated by a row of vacant seats about it A roll of the tribes gives an accurate impression of this organization with each tribe divided into ten centuriae five of juniores and five of seniores The officials capable of presiding illus trate their powers by practical exercise and the functions of the assembly are shown in a similar manner Each tribe elects a curator tribus who has charge of the tribe at elections and a tri bunes aerarius who collects what funds are needed306 THE SCHOOL REVIEW The second tribal assembly composed only of plebeians the concilium plebis is formed by merely asking the patricians to with draw and the plebeians remain organized by tribes This completes the formal organization of the state From the very first it was found impossible in any appreciable degree to mod ify the complicated organization of ancient Rome and still convey a correct idea of it When however we secure a thorough grasp of the organization by all Latin pupils at one time each successive entering class will be absorbed and assimilated into it The initial leavening of the whole lump is the serious difficulty and is accom plished best by gradual stages either by beginning with the classes of one or two instructors or by initiating each successive beginning class and waiting four years for the process to complete itself Suc cess depends upon the interest of the pupil his interest depends on his understanding and nothing could be more useless than to put an inert mass of pupils through motions the significance of which is lost upon them

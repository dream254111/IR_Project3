CITIZENSHIP ARTHUR HUNTINGTON NASON New York University Special preparation for citizenship by methods other than or auxil iary to the course in civil government is not a new experiment in secondary schools In some the class in civics has been organized as a mock legislature in others the school discipline has been instrusted to a student board Each of these methods if successfully carried out gives doubtless some measure of preparation for citizenship Both however fall short in one respect The mock legislature is so frankly artificial that it can give but slight sense of civic responsibility and to intrust to the students the maintenance of discipline is at best to prepare them for a work in which but few citizens need participate the actual maintenance of law and order What is needed primarily to meet the conditions of our day is training in the efficient and honest administration of the public purse This training to be most effective must not deal with money that is imaginary or with money in which the pupils are not vitally concerned On the contrary it must involve an actual fund raised by the student community itself and expended to meet its actual needs Such conditions may seem at first thought difficult to obtain yet it is under precisely these conditions that the highschool pupils of Augusta Maine in an organization entitled the Cony High School Assembly are giving themselves all unconsciously this financial training for citizenship The school in which this organization has grown up is a public high school numbering about two hundred pupils situated in a town of about twelve thousand inhabitants Here thirteen years ago when interscholastic athletics were first coming into favor the students were confronted with two problems The first was How should they pay for the equipment of a school gymnasium and meet the expenses of their athletic teams  Gate receipts were utterly inadequate and 505506 THE SCHOOL REVIEW to solicit funds upon the business street was admittedly a public nui sance Their solution was a fair accompanied by amateur theatricals or other entertainment At first they cleared annually from one hundred to one hundred and fifty dollars Later under improved management they increased this amount to five and even six hund red dollars Thus without resorting to public subscription the stu dents solved the problem of ways and means But their second problem was equally important By what method should their money be apportioned  Their solution was certainly characteristic of this school as it was in the early nineties Its debat ing society was then a hotbed of budding parliamentarians its leading secret fraternity was devoting its evenings to mock legislative sessions and finally one of its most influential students was serving his first term as page in the state senate These circumstances made it but natural that the power to appropriate money from the common fund should be vested in a highly organized parliamentary body The precise form of this body however was determined by gradual evolution As organized September 20 I892 the Cony High School Assembly was like a New England townmeeting It consisted of all the students in the school was officered by a moderator and clerk and met upon written call of any five members to act upon the busi ness named in the warrant This simple organization however soon proved inadequate Appropriations could be rushed through without due consideration and when once granted might be misapplied with impunity The assembly had no control over other school organi zations and some of them notably the editorial board of the school magazine did not scruple to incur a debt and then to expect the assembly to meet the deficit Possession of the common purse how ever soon gave to the assembly its rightful ascendency Little by little it adopted legislation perfecting its own procedure and bringing the other organizations under its control and at the close of the second year of its existence the assembly embodied these provisions in a new constitution Under this constitution which has changed but little since its adoption eleven years ago the assembly has become an organization much more like a state senate or house of representatives than like its original model the townmeeting An appropriation for exampleTHE CONY HIGH SCHOOL ASSEMBLY 507 must now be proposed in the form of an act must be accompanied by a detailed statement of facts must receive two several readings before its passage to be enacted and must be posted on the school bulletinboard for at least twentythree hours between the two read ings This last rule may be suspended but only by unanimous consent As a further safeguard the assembly forbids its treasurer to make payment except on a warrant signed by the moderator This warrant specifies the date on which the appropriation was passed the amount appropriated and the person to whom it is payable For the signature of the latter moreover the printed form provides also a blank receipt Thus for each appropriation the treasurer at the end of her term of office for the treasurer is now invariably a girl submits to the Auditing committee both a warrant and a receipt As the amount handled by the treasurer in a single year has in one instance exceeded 1300 the real importance of these safeguards is evident to every student But the assemblys watchfulness does not end when its appropria tions leave the treasury All officers that handle assembly fundsnot alone its own officers as the superintendent of the gymnasium and the chairman of the library committee but also the officers of other organi zations as the managers of the several athletic teamsall are required to submit detailed reports which are audited with the same care that is bestowed upon the treasurers accounts In view of the elaborate nature of the organization just described it is perhaps an occasion for surprise that the assembly has survived and flourished through these thirteen years A part of its success doubtless has resulted from the unobtrusive cooperation of the teach ers especially of the present principal Mr C F Cook But the chief credit belongs to the students themselves For several years it was the custom of the retiring officers to meet during the summer vacation to drill the aspirants of the coming year for the duties that might devolve upon them Later a secret fraternity was formed with pro cedure similar to that of the assembly and this not only gave excellent training in parliamentary practice but on several occasions rendered service as a good government club in the cause of civic righteous ness The custom moreover by which the clerk of one year usually becomes the moderator of the next has undoubtedly tended to preserve508 THE SCHOOL REVIEW the continuity of method while increasing the standard of efficiency To give a more definite idea of the usual method of procedure and the nature of the business done a brief quotation from the Journal may be permitted The following extract shows the transactions of the seventh eighth and ninth meetings of the assembly of 1899I900 It is interesting not only because it illustrates within a brief space a considerable variety of procedurethe passage of a bill in regular course of a bill under suspension of the rules of an order and of a resolution and the election of an officer by ballotbut more especi ally because the particular votes here recorded are themselves signi ficant TUESDAY FEBRUARY 20 1900 Assembly called to order by clerk and call

Stinson for the fine picture of Maines late statesman James G Blaine which he has so kindly presented to the school Read and passed On motion adjourned FRIDAY FEBRUARY 23 1900 Assembly called to order by clerk and call read Moderator took the chair Journal of the last meeting approved without reading Mr Gannett bill An act to appropriate one hundred and fifty 15o dollars for a piano fund The bill received its two separate readings under suspension of the rules and passed to be enacted On motion adjourned In determining the value of the Cony High School Assembly as unconscious training for citizenship we should consider however not only the method but also the object of its appropriations In a school in which athletic interest runs high in which each athletic manager desires to make the best possible showing and in which the annual fair by which the money is raised is avowedly given prima rily for the support of school athletics it must be a constant temptation to the students to appropriate practically their entire fund for merely current expenses Yet in no instance has such a disposition of the funds been made On the contrary the assembly has uniformly in vested a portion of its income for such purposes as books for the school library pictures and statuary for the rooms and apparatus for the gymnasium Indeed out of the 426328 appropriated by the assembly in the thirteen years of its existence 139458 or nearly 33 per cent has gone for these permanent improvements The distri bution of these appropriations by years will appear from the following table IThe foregoing

In this 139458 appropriated for permanent improvements the several items are as follows library 80500 gymnasium apparatus 23735 toward a new piano 15000 toward new blackboards 7500 pictures and statuary 6ooo all other items 6723 The interest which the assembly has manifested in improving the equipment of the school has exerted an influence even outside the student body The practice of presenting pictures and statuary to the school has spread from the assembly and the classes to the general public and the purchase of gymnasium apparatus by the assembly has induced the city to provide more spacious quarters for the gym nasium But most interesting are the two instances in which the assem bly following doubtless the example of Mr Carnegie has announced to the city government that if the city would appropriate a specified amount for some needed improvement the assembly would appro priate an equal sum In each case the city has accepted the assem blys proposition and a new piano and new slate blackboards are the results To overestimate the value of the Cony High School Assembly as training for citizenship is of course easy We must remember that many boys take no part in its discussions that many girls attend its meetings only because they are required to attend But at least this 1 To this amount must be added an appropriation of 125 for the gymnasium made from the proceeds of the first fair before the assembly was in existenceTHE CONY HIGH SCHOOL ASSEMBLY 51I may be said Each pupil that graduates from the Cony High School has lived for four years in a community where his labor contributes to the common fund and where his voice helps to determine how it shall be spent He has gained at least some knowledge of parlia mentary procedure some notion of financial accountability some consciousness of the difference between wisdom and extravagance in public appropriations In the character thus formed is the true preparation for citizenship

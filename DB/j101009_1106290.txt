crime and prompt and vigorous in its punishment it is very jealous of the liberty of the citizen and throws around him every safeguard of a fair and impar tial trial It gives him the right to demand the cause and nature of his accusation thereby assuring him of all needful information ofthe offense with which he is charged it guarantees to him a speedy trial by an impartial jury of his vicinage without whose unanimous con sent he cannot be found guilty thereby assuring him a prompt trial an impartial tribunal and a just verdict and it warns the jury that they are not to convict unless satisfied of the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt Burks J in Pine v Commonwealth 121 Va 812 652 93 S E 652 Opinions of CourtBrevity Desirableln Kellogg v Chapman Tex Civ App 201 S W 1096 1101 the court said There seems to be in our good state a desire on the part of the bench and bar that in the consideration of cases in the appellate court extensive opinions should not be handed down but that briefness should by the appellate courts be considered among other things of prime im portance in the consideration of the cases submitted In State v Williams 128 N C 573 37 S E 952 the following is found The multiplication of law reports makes it desirable that the courts should refrain from filing opinions which state no new points or new application of settled principles Judicial Comment on DictaA dictum of the court of last resort should not be entirely disregarded Bird v St Paul Fire  Marine Ins Co 167 N Y Supp 707 710 Looseness of language and dicta in judicial opinions either si lently acquiesced in or perpetuated by inadvertent repetition often insidiously exert their influence until they result in confusing the ap plication of the law or themselves become crystallized into a kind of authority wliich fhe courts without reference to true principle are constrained to follow These observations are particularly ap plicable to the doctrine of contributory negligence and especially in its relation to what is generally called the rule of Davies v Mann All along the highway of judicial decision we find it so strewn with the wreeks of overruled cases

defeated in the Supreme Court by that tribunal taking cognizance of the maxim that it is the letter of the law that kill eth but the spirit that maketh alive they sometimes elevate the tips of their proboscides and sneer at the decision against them as judge made law It is not clear that judgemade law may not sometimes promote substantial justice more than statutes enacted by legisla tures There was a case decided by a justice of the Supreme Court of California at an early day in which the rights of a drunken mall were clearly and sensibly defined The plaintiff while inebriated had stepped upon a rotten plank in the sidewalk which gave way under him and as a result his leg was broken He sued the city and the answer of the municipality was that as the plaintiff was in toxicated at the time of the accident he was guilty of contributory negligence and therefore not entitled to recover This plea proved unavailing with the court and jury and he was accorded a judgment for damages The city appealed but the Supreme Court affirmed the judgment saying A drunken man has as good a right to per fect sidewalk as a sober man and he needs one a good deal more Case and Comment The Lawyers ServiceThe lawyer who discharges faithfully the ordinary duties of the day who contributes his best efforts to the prompt and just settlement of all controversies wherein his interpo sition is invited whose advice and opinion from day to day keeps the business and social machinery of the country constantly adjusted to new laws and to new conditions is serving his country equally with those who build ships and fill the granaries of the country with wheat and corn Especially is this true if such service is rendered with an eye ever alert and single to the highest interests of the na tion in this its hour of greatest needAlexander v Robbins in Cen tral Law Journal An Honest LawyerAn honest lawyer is the lifeguard of our fortunes the best collateral security for an estate a trusty pilot to

that practices law so as never to forget the Gospel but always4 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S wears a conscience as well as a gown though he knows all the crit icisms of his faculty and the nice snapperadoes of practice yet he never uses them He draws his knowledge from the original springs digesting the whole body of the law in a laborious and regular method but especially aims to be well versed in the practice of every court and rightly to understand the art of good pleading as knowing them to be the most useful to unravel the knotty intrigues of the cause and reduce it to an issue

being a man of that kind may have been keeping other women at different places and at intervals during the time a woman claimed he was her commonlaw husband does not militate against the force of

more appropriate title for his remarks Coal as a factor in modern history or Coal as the great re former and revolutionizer By reviewing past history it would be noticed that certain great events had taken place each of which marked a step in the advance of civilization The connection between these events was not always apparent but in fact they were interdependent and formed a logical sequence in many cases one directly or indirectly causing the next The ancient Greeks were famed for their literary and aesthetic culture in which they excelled all other peoples ancient or modern Their passionate temperament however and system of slavery left unlaid the material foun dations of permanent national prosperity Again the genius of the Romans had displayed itself in their military achievements and doubtless Rome would have continued to be the mistress of the world had it not been for the luxurious and profligate habits into which her people drifted and through which she fell an easy prey to the barbarians So monstrous were their excesses that their punishment was inevitable and overwhelming The excellence which those na tions had attained had no doubt benefited succeeding generations The secret of true and permanent progress con sisted in the application of science to the useful arts and the development of this fundamental principle of progress had conmmenceed only during more recent years This was the power that had revolutionized social and political life No one revolution had effected thorough and permanent changes By the instrumentality of each the light of liberty had shone for a brief interval but the intolerance which was put down by it had been too often succeeded by equal 1 Abstract of a lecture delivered Saturday April 19 in the US national museum Washington DC by Prof J S NEw BERRY of New York Revised by the author NCE 597 oppression on the part of those who had come into power Yet each change had brought about a con dition whereby the masses of the people lad gained a greater or less advantage and the power which each revolution had taken from the sovereign had been given to the people These exchanges of power were more apparent in the history of England than of any country on the European continent There the reign of every king had been despotic until the time of King John when the Magna Charta was wrested from him and thus was taken the first step towards the true liberty of the subject Henry VIII disregarding all laws human and divine had assumed as much despotism of action as was compatible with the then slowly advancing state of civilization Elizabeth too was conspicuous for her assumption of unlimited power Nor was Cromwells power less supreme than that of the kings and queens before him Then followed the court of Charles II with all its splendor and vice But soon after when the house of Hanover flourished a certain popular power began to underminie the autocracy of royalty Then the Earl of Chatham the elder Pitt albeit with much individual pride and haughtiness and with no special sympathy with democracy became cham pion of the English people and wielded a power which had never before been held by any subject of the crown Pitt declared that he represented the people of England and Wilkes resistance to the royal party again and again caused his election as a member of the House of Commons The last at tempt at despotic power on the part of the reigning monarch was the unjust taxation by George III of Englands American colonies Since that time the power of the subject had been increasing in England and at this day there was no country in which the rights of the individual were more fully recognized The conservatism of the English nation had not per mitted the dethronement of rank and title This was in the opinion of the lecturer probably the result of inheritance not choice He said moreover that the distinction of rank held in check the power of money and refinement and culture were thereby advanced but if the present lmonarch were to at tempt to resume the despotism of some of her prede cessors a storm of revolution would sweep away monarch and throne and peers For this changed and ameliorated condition of affairs special credit was due to Sir Robert Peel Cobden John Bright anld Mr Gladstone the present premier But the full triumph of democratic principles had not yet been fully realized in England although it was rap idly approaching It was worthy of note that each Parliament introduced more liberal measures and that the power of the House of Commons was fast superseding that of the House of Lords England is now not only the home of freedom but an asylum for the oppressed Her shores are sought as places of refuge by fugitives of all kinds who here found justice and if innocent safety The moral and physical condition too of the pres ent generation is raised and this age is conspicuous for its religious freedom luxury and the achieve598 SCIENCE ments of scientific investigation We of this day scarcely realize that many things which are now considered necessaries of life were absolutely un known a hundred years ago These changes have been wrought by the action of cause and effect How interesting was the inquiry into the causes of this peaceful revolution that had been and still was going on  Some historians had ascribed the changes to certain inherent qualities in man which must develop as time rolls along Others referred this progressive state to the continued effects of the Reformation and considered it as the fruit of a purer and broader religious faith The lecturer admitted that the emancipation of the mind from narrow dogmas had had its elevating influence but denied that this would entirely account for the present con dition of civilization Since this age of freedom is also an age of scepticism he contended that the most potent cause of the eminence of England and of the spread of democracy was the production of wealtli through the industrial arts  wealth created and con trolled by the untitled classes who thereby acquire selfrespect selfassertion and political power All historians had recognized this truth in part but had stopped short of the conclusions which to the speak ers mind every unprejudiced man must reach The development of machinery and the useful arts con stituted the most distinctive feature in the aspect of our modern life This had created cities provided occupation for the people and was the means which had supplied the majority of our material wants And the agent of this development was coal This conclusion might perhaps appear to be a reductio ad absurdum but he thought that the truth of the assertion could be demonstrated Coal sup plied us with light heat and motive power without which our condition would be one of darkness and inactivity The wheels of industry would be stopped and the characteristic activities of modern life would be arrested In a pound of coal was stored sufficient force to raise 11580000 pounds one foot and it had been estimated that on an average 1500000 foot pounds were utilized in the combustion of a pound of coal Supposing this amount to be equal to the force exerted by one man in a days labor then three hundred pounds of coal were equal to the force exerted by one man in a whole year in other words a ton of coal yielded a force equal to the labor of six men and a boy for a year and the force exerted by the average amount of coal produced in Englanid in a year would be equivalent to the labor of two hun dred millions of men for the same period A mo ments reflection would convince us of the immense effect produced by this force upon our modern civil ization If out of the amount of coal annually raised from the English mines 20000000 tons repre sented the net profit it would be seen that tllis profit was equivalent to the labor of 133000000 people working ten hours a day for a year Was it then surprising that with such a revenue England should be the richest nation on the globe or the most pro lific  She had planted colonies in those parts of the earth which were richest in agricultural and mineral VOL III No 67 resources to wit the United States Canada Aus tralia New Zealand Cape of Good Hope India Jamaica etc and these are fast becoming great nationalities This marvellous success had by some been attributed to psychological rather than material causes but the true cause the speaker thought was the development of machinery and the industrial arts consequent upon her abundant supply of coal In the thirteenth cenitury when coal was first substi tuted for wood and even a century later its use was regarded as a nuisance and actually forbidden by royal enactment on account of the snloke which it evolved Indeed history told us that in 1257 Queen Anne wife of Henry III left Nottingham on account of the smoke caused by the burning of coal By the middle of the sixteenth century however coal was in general use and a considerable quantity was exported to France In 1621 Dudley had devised a method whereby stone coal could be substituted for charcoal in the manufacture of iron Then came gradually the introduction of steamengines in place of horse power and iron rails instead of wooden ones for the transportation of coal from the mines The years 1702 1776 1815 and 1820 were conspicuous for im proved changes in connection with steamlocomotion and in the lastnamed year wroughtiron was sub stituted for castiron in the manufacture of rails Fifty years ago Robert Stevenson perfected the loco motive thus making the railroad the great pathway of traffic and travel The lecturer then cited statis tics which showed that the increase in the produce of iron and steel was proportional to the amount of coal produced These were he said not only factors in the progress already noted but were its proximate causes It was worthy of note that in those great English towns such as Manchester Liverpool Leeds and Newcastle where coal was most largely used the voice of the people was most powerful The lecturer then reviewed the possibilities for advancement in the United States with its coal area of two hundred and fifty thousand square miles He referred to the almost unlimited deposits of iron copper lead and the precious metals and to the vast wealth to be drawn from the soil by a thorough system of agriculture Thus he argued that the United States possessed all the qualifications neces sary to make it a greater and happier country than the world had ever seen The great danger arising from these vast resources was the worship of the wealth they were destined to produce The general accumulation of wealth by a nation was undoubtedly a blessing but when held by the few causing the impoverishment of the many it could only be re garded as a curse We might however hope that when the evils of wealthworship exceeded a certain limit the people would again rise and correct them as history teaches us they have done in the past Among the influences which tended to restrict tile effect of wealth on legislation was the introduction of civilservice reform The contest between labor and capital was far from adjustment but the problem was under careful consideration and in some in stances had beel practically wrougllt out to the satisSCIENCE faction of all inmmediately concerned and to the instruction and guidance of others The remedy for the excessive love of money would be found in the substitution of other and hilger objects of ambition This could not be expected at this stage of our nations growth but it would come with greater maturity This age he said was the seedtime and tot the harvest nor could the full corn appear until after tle intermediate stages of the blade and ear THE PRESENT SUNSPOT MAXIMUM AT p 72 of the second volume of this journal the observations of the solar spots made during the pre vious six years by Professor Todd now of Amherst college were collated and the inference drawn that the present maximum of spots had already passed at the middle of the year 1883 The remarkable solar outbursts occurring at intervals throughout that year and the continued manifestation of spotactivity dur ing the present year have led to renewed discussion of this subject abroad where very different views are held by the leading authorities in solar physics Dr Wolf of Zurich inclines to the belief that we have not yet the data for determining accurately the epoch of maximum much the highest monthly maximum having occurred in April 1882 while the relative number expressing the spotprevalence for the year 1883 is easily seen to be greater than that for the year previous Faye thinks the maximum undoubtedly past and regards the spottedness during 1883 as just such secondary maxima as might well occur in the progress of a periodic phenomenon which passes rapidly and without hesitation from a minimum to the following maximum but which passes gently by a series of secondary oscillations from the maximum to the following minimum as it is well known the solar spots do Wolf states that in 1882 there were no days without spots while there were four such in 1883 Tacchini of Rome concludes from the spotob servations of 1882 and 1883 that the solar activity has been on the increase during the latter year for al though the difference in the number of spots is very small the number of groups in 1883 has been very Iuch greater and the extent of the spots has been truly extraordinary it has been double that of 1882 Dr Spoerer of Potsdam calls attention to a question regarding the numbers and positions on the solar surface of the spots observed during the past thirty years While it has long been recognized that the spots are most numerous not at the solar equator but in zones of solar latitude about 15 to 20 Spoerers discussion emphasizes the fact  that from the time of one minimum until the next the region of greatest spotfrequency gradually drifts downward from the zone 30 to 25 to the immediate neighborhood of the equator and that about the time of maximum its seat lies about 170 or 18 As the next minimum period is approached spots more than 15 from the equator gradually become rarer than spots of 35 latitude and upwards were at the time of maximum But 599 directly the time of minimum is past spots begin to appear again in those higher latitudes whlere but very few perhaps not a single one had been seen for sev eral years As justly remarked by the editor of the Observatory this law of sudden transfer of spot activity from one zone to another is one of the most striking revelations of solar research and must be accounted for by that theory of spotperiodicity which would be accepted as satisfactory Regarding the determination of the present spot maximum the same writer observes that the chief difficulty lies in a variety of opinion regarding what class of data is to be accepted as affording the true index of the state of solar activity The unusual mag netic perturbations have occurred in coincidence with  the appearance or rapid development of some single spot or group of spots of abnormal extent and not at the same time with the existence of great numbers of small spots It would appear thus most likely that the total spotarea rather than spotnumbers should be taken as the true index GUYOTS VIEW OF CREATION Creation or the biblical cosmogony in the lilght of modern science By ARNOLD GUYOT LLD New York Scribners Sons 1884 16139 p 9 pi 16 TEE great eminence of Professor Guyot in several departments of science is a guaranty that what he writes is worthy of attention The singular simplicity and clearness of his style make what he writes interesting But more than all the earnestness the truthloving sincerity and deep devoutness of the man in all he wrote or said or did take captive the reader or hearer or companion and bear him along by the force of sympathy There has been no teacher in this country who has in spired his classes with deeper personal love or profounder reverence To us who knew him well his very presence was a benediction It is hardly necessary to say therefore how deeply and sincerely we sympathize with the devout spirit which pervades this his latest book and the noble aim of the author in pub lishing it Surely if we must have reconcilia tions of this kind between the geological record and the Mosaic cosmogony this one is the noblest and the most rational which we have yet seen If any ones declining faith still requires such tonic we most cordially recom mend this one but it has long seemed to us that a complete change of air is the better indeed the only remedy We believe that the time is rapidly approaching if it has not al ready come when the whole subject must be looked upon from a different and higTher point of view We have ourselves in earlier years MAY 16 1884

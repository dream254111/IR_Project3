BRIEF ACCOUNT OF A ROMAN TESSERA BY MR JOHN WARD F R S  PROF RHETOR GRESH T H E BRASS PLATE WHICH ACCOMPANIES THIS PAPER AND HAS BEEN THE OCCA SION OF IT WAS DUG UP SOME TIME SINCE AT MARKET STREET IN BEDFORDSHIRE WHICH LIES IN THE ROMAN ROAD CALLED WATLING STREET ABOUT FIVE MILES ON THIS SIDE DUNSTABLE AND WAS BROUGHT TO THE SOCIETY BY THEIR WORTHY MEMBER SAMUEL CLARK ESQ READ MARCH 3 1747 THE225 THE INSCRIPTION INGRAVEN ON THE TWO SIDES IS T E S D E I M A R S E D I A R V M WHICH WORDS MAY AS I APPREHEND BE READ AT LENGTH IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER TESSERA DEI MARTIS SEDIARUM THE FIRST ABBREVIATED WORD T E S I TAKE TO STAND FOR TESSERA A DYE OR CUBE A SO CALLED FROM THE GREEK WORD  OR  FOUR RESPECT BE ING HAD TO ITS NUMBER OF SIDES DISTINCT FROM THE TWO HORIZONTAL PLANES ABOVE AND BELOW AND UN DER THIS CONSIDERATION IT WAS DISTINGUISHED FROM THE TALUS WHICH BEING ROUND AT EACH END CONTAINED ONLY FOUR PLANES OR FACES WHEREON IT COULD STAND AND THEREFORE WHEN THROWN HAD NO MORE THAN TWO SIDE FACES IN VIEW HENCE LUDERE TALIS ET TESSERIS ARE SPOKEN OF BY ROMAN WRITERS AS TWO DIFFERENT GAMES B SEE THE T A B BUT IF THIS WAS THE FIRST AND ORIGINAL NOTION OF THE WORD TESSERA IT WAS APPLIED AFTERWARDS TO MANY OTHER THINGS AND THAT NOT SO MUCH FROM A SIMILI TUDE IN THE FIGURE AS FROM THE RELATION THEY BORE TO SOME OTHER THING OF WHICH THEY WERE THE SIGN OR TOKEN AS THE POINTS ON THE UPPER PLANE OF THE DYE DENOTED THE GOOD OR ILL SUCCESS OF THE CAST TO RECITE THE SEVERAL USES OF THIS WORD WOULD BOTH BE TEDIOUS AND UNNECESSARY AND THEREFORE I SHALL MEN TION SOME FEW ONLY FROM WHICH THE DESIGN OF THIS PLATE MAY THE MORE EASILY APPEAR AND A MACROB IN SOMN SCIP LIB 11 CAP 2 B    CAP 16226 AND I SHALL BEGIN WITH THE TESSERA HOSPITALIS WHICH WAS EITHER PUBLIC OR PRIVATE AS TO THE FOR MER WE FIND AMONG THE INSCRIPTIONS PUBLISHED BY GRUTER INSTANCES OF TWO MUNICIPAL TOWNS WHO PUT THEMSELVES UNDER THE PATRONAGE OF A ROMAN GOVER NOR AND THE RECIPROCAL INGAGEMENT BETWEEN THEM WHICH WAS INGRAVED ON TWO COPPER PLATES IN THE FORM OF AN OBLONG SQUARE WITH A PEDIMENT AT THE TOP IS CALLED IN BOTH T E S S E R A H O S P I T A L I S A THE DESIGN OF THE LATTER WAS TO CULTIVATE AND MAIN TAIN A LASTING FREINDSHIP BETWEEN PRIVATE PERSONS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND GAVE A MUTUAL CLAIM TO THE CONTRACTING PARTIES AND THEIR DESCENDANTS OF A RE CEPTION AND KIND TREATMENT AT EACH OTHERS HOUSES AS OCCASION OFFERED FOR WHICH END IT WAS REQUI SITE THAT THOSE TESSERAE SHOULD BE SO CONTRIVED AS MIGHT BEST PRESERVE THE MEMORY OF THAT TRANSACTION TO POSTERITY B AND ONE METHOD OF DOING THIS WAS BY DIVIDING ONE OF THEM LENGTHWISE INTO TWO EQUAL PARTS UPON EACH OF WHICH ONE OF THE PARTIES WROTE HIS NAME AND INTERCHANGED IT WITH THE OTHER A DRAUGHT OF ONE MADE OF BONE AND SO DIVIDED MAY BE SEEN IN THOMASINUS WITH THE NAME OF THE PERSON ON EACH PART UPON ONE OF THEM IS P O L Y N I C E S A S C A N I O F AND UPON THE OTHER C L A P H Y R A N D R A E M I F THE A PAG CCCLXII CCCLXIII B PLAUT

CONFRINGERE WHICH WAS APPLIED TO THOSE PERSONS WHO VIOLATED THEIR ENGAGEMENTS B THE TESSERAE FRUMENTARIAE ARE OFTEN MENTIONED BY ROMAN WRITERS WHICH WERE SMALL TALLIES GIVEN BY THE EMPERORS TO THE POPULACE AT ROME INTITLING THEM TO THE RECEPTION OF A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF CORN FROM THE PUBLIC AT STATED SEASONS AND THOSE WHO WERE POSSESSED OF THEM WHEN THEY DID NOT WANT THE CORN SOMETIMES SOLD THEM TO OTHERS AS WE LEARN FROM THE SATYRIST WHEN HE SAIS SUMMULA NE PEREAT QUA VILIS TESSERA VENIT FRUMENTI C THE PERSON WHO HAD THE INSPECTION OF THESE TES SERAE AND DISTRIBUTED THE CORN TO THOSE WHO PRO DUCED THEM SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN CALLED TESSERARIUS AS PIGNORIUS OBSERVES FROM A FUNERAL MONUMENT INSCRIBED SYMPHORO TESSERARIO SER CAESARIS D THESE TESSERAE WERE FIRST MADE OF WOOD AS APPEARS

ANOTHER SORT OF TESSERA NOT MUCH UNLIKE THESE WHICH INTITLED PERSONS TO A SIGHT OF THE PUBLIC GAMES AND OTHER DIVERSIONS BUT THEY ARE GE NERALLY MADE IN THE FORM OF AN OBLONG SQUARE PIG NORIUS HAS GIVEN US THE DRAUGHT OF ONE IN HIS OWN POS SESSION WHICH CONSISTED OF IVORY UPON ONE OF THE SIDES IS THE NAME PHILOMVSVS PERELI ON THE NEXT SPECTAVIT ON THE THIRD A TRIDENT AND UPON THE FOURTH A PALM BRANCH B THE TWO LAST OF WHICH PLAINLY SHEW THAT IT WAS GIVEN FOR ADMISSION TO THE COMBATS OF THE GLADIATORS OTHERS OF THEM HAD ON DIFFERENT SIDES THE NAME OF THE PERSON WITH THE DAY ON WHICH THE SHOW WAS EXHIBITED AND THE NAMES OF THE CONSULS AT THAT TIME INSTANCES OF THESE MAY BE SEEN IN THOMASINUS ONE OF WHICH AS HE SAIS WAS MADE OF YELLOW GLASS C BUT THE TESSERA MILITARIS MOST FREQUENTLY OCCURS IN THE ROMAN HISTORIANS WHICH WAS THE SIGNAL GIVEN BY THE GENERAL OR CHEIF COMMANDER OF AN ARMY AS A DIRECTION TO THE SOLDIERS FOR PUTING IN EXECUTION ANY DUTY OR SERVICE REQUIRED OF THEM THIS UPON URGENT OCCASIONS WAS ONLY VOCAL AS FOR A SUDDEN MARCH A INSCRIPT ANTIQ PAG 530 B UBI SUPRA PAG 38 C DE TESS HOSPITAL CAP 15229 MARCH OR AN ATTACK UPON THE ENEMY BUT IN ORDI NARY CASES AS FOR SETING THE WATCH TAKING THEIR DINER OR THE LIKE IT WAS WRITEN ON A TABLET THO IN EITHER WAY IT WAS FIRST GIVEN BY THE GENERAL TO THE OFFICERS NEXT IN RANK AND FROM THEM TO THE SUBALTERNS TILL IT CAME TO THE PERSON WHOSE PROVINCE IT WAS TO COMMUNICATE IT TO THE SOLDIERS IN EACH COMPANY THIS TABLET WAS COMMONLY MADE OF WOOD AS APPEARS FROM POLYBIUS WHO CALLS IT  A SMALL PIECE OF WOOD A THE SIGNAL INSCRIBED UPON IT WAS VERY SHORT AND USUALLY COMPRISED IN ONE OR TWO WORDS AS INFERREDVICTORIAINFERRED PALMA VIRTUS DEUS NOBISCUM TRIUMPHUS IMPERATORIS MENTIOND BY VEGETIUS B WITH MANY OTHERS OF THE LIKE NA TURE WHICH MAY BE SEEN IN ANTIENT WRITERS THE PERSON WHOSE OFFICE IT WAS TO IMPART THE SIGNAL IM MEDIATLY TO THE SOLDIERS IS BY VEGETIUS CALLED TESSE RARIUS C HENCE IN GRUTERS INSCRIPTIONS WE MEET WITH AVRE IANVARIVS TESSERARIVS LEG XIII AND C GALERIO C LIB AGATHON TESSERARIO COH XII PRAET MILITVM AS ALSO L POMPEIO L F POMP REBVRRO TESSERARIO IN CENTVRIAD BY WHICH DIFFERENT FORMS OF EXPRESSION COMPARED TOGETHER ONE WOULD BE LEAD TO CONCLUDE THAT EVERY CENTURY HAD ITS TESSERARIUS FROM WHOM THE SOLDIERS IMMEDIATLY RECEIVED THE SIGNAL AND THAT WHEN THE LEGION OR COHORT ONLY IS MENTIONED THE MEANING IS NOT THAT THE PERSON NAMED IN THE INSCRIPTION PERFORMED THAT OFFICE A LIB VI PAG 479 ED PARIS B LIB III CAP 5 C LIB 11 CAP 7 D PAG DCVI 10 DCVIII 7 DCIX 10 G G 2230 OFFICE TO THE WHOLE LEGION OR COHORT BUT ONLY TO SOME PARTICULAR CENTURY IN EACH OF THEM BUT BESIDES THESE CIVIL AND MILITARY TESSERAE THERE WERE OTHERS WHICH MORE ESPECIALLY RELATED TO RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS AND MAY THEREFORE BE CALLED SACRED TO WHICH THE INSCRIPTION ON THIS BRASS PLATE SEEMS TO AGREE FOR THE TWO NEXT WORDS INGRAVEN UPON IT NAMELY DEI MAR MUST I THINK STAND FOR DEI MARTIS AND IF THE LAST WORD SEDIARVM BE TAKEN FOR THE NAME OF A TOWN CALLED SEDIAE THIS TESSERA MAY RESPECT THE GOD MARS AS THE TUTELAR DEITY OF THAT PLACE THE RELIGIOUS WORSHIP AMONG THE ROMANS CONSISTED CHEIFLY IN SACRIFICES AND OTHER PUBLIC CEREMONIES THE EXPENSE OF WHICH IN PARTICULAR PLACES WAS SUPPORTED EITHER BY THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE INHABITANTS OR BY PRIVATE GIFTS WE HAVE AN INSTANCE OF THE LATTER IN AN IN SCRIPTION FIRST PUBLISHED BY REINESIUS WHERE IT IS SAID THAT L VERATIUS FELICISSIMUS A PATRON OF TOLEN TIUM OR TOLLENTIUM A MUNICIPAL TOWN IN ITALY GAVE TO THE INHABITANTS THEIR ANNUAL SACRIFICES WHICH WERE OFFERED ON THE ELEVENTH OF MAY FOR A PLENTIFUL HAR VEST THAT INSCRIPTION IS CUT ON A BRASS PLATE IN THE FORM OF AN OBLONG SQUARE WITH A FEMALE BUST IN A PEDIMENT AT THE TOP DESIGNED VERY PROBABLY TO RE PRESENT THE DIETY TO WHOM THEY ADDRESSED AS THE INSCRIPTION IS PECULIAR IN ITS KIND I SHALL HERE GIVE THE WHOLE OF IT AS IT STANDS IN REINESIUS TESSERAM A GRUT PAG CXCIV 2231 T E S S E

A S F E L I C I T A THIS IS CALLED TESSERA PAGANICA AS I IMAGINE FROM ITS INTITLING THE PAGANI OR INHABITANTS OF THAT TOWN TO THE ANNUAL CLAIM OF THE SACRIFICES THEREIN MEN TIONED AND SO FAR IT AGREED WITH THE NATURE OF A PUBLIC TESSERA WHICH BEING LODGED IN THE HANDS OF THE PROPER OFFICER AUTHORIZED HIM TO COLLECT THE SE VERAL CONTRIBUTIONS ASSIGNED FOR SUCH RELIGIOUS PUR POSES AND OF THIS LATTER SORT I TAKE THE PLATE TO HAVE BEEN WHICH MAKES THE SUBJECT OF OUR PRESENT INQUIRY BOTH THE FORM AND SIZE OF IT SUITING VERY WELL WITH SUCH A DESIGN AS IT WAS PORTABLE AND READY TO BE PRODUCED IF OCCASION REQUIRED AND AGREABLY TO THIS NOTION OF THE WORD TESSERA THE AN TIENT GLOSSARIES INTERPRET TESSERARIUS BY  A SCRIBE OR CLERK AS TO THE FOLLOWING WORD S E D I A R V M THO IT NO WHERE ELSE OCCURS THAT I KNOW OF YET THIS I PRESUME CAN BE NO JUST OBJECTION AGAINST ITS BEING TAKEN HERE FOR THE NAME OF A TWON CALLED SEDIAE WHEN IT IS CONSIDERED HOW MANY INSTANCES OF THE LIKE NATURE ARE TO BE FOUND IN THE INSCRIPTIONS COL LECTED BY GRUTER AND OTHERS WHICH GIVE US THE NAMES A APPEND NUM 8232 NAMES OF MANY ANTIENT PLACES IN THE ROMAN PRO VINCES NOT MENTIONED BY ANY OTHER WRITERS AND BESIDES THE FORM OF THIS WORD APPEARS ANALOGOUS TO THE NAMES OF SEVERAL OTHER ROMAN TOWNS HERE IN BRITAIN AS DUROBROVAE ROCHESTER RATAE LEICESTER RUTUPIAE RICHBOROUGH SPINAE SPENE AND SOME OTHERS IT IS NOT IMPROBABLE THAT THIS PLATE WAS FOUND NOT FAR FROM THE PLACE WHOSE NAME IT BEARS AND WHICH MIGHT BE SITUATED AMONG THE CATEUCHLANI AS THEIR TERRITORIES ARE DESCRIBED BY CAMDEN A BUT AS I HAVE NEVER BEFORE SEEN NOR HEARD OF ANY THING SIMILAR TO IT I WOULD SUBMIT WHAT IS HERE OFFERED TO THE JUDGEMENT OF THE CURIOUS IN THESE INQUIRIES G C FEB 25 1747 JOHN WARD

MISSIONARY FIELD COMPOSE THIS BOOK IN GENERAL THE TONE OF THE WORK SHOWS SINGULARLY LITTLE OF THE LACK OF APPRECIATION OF RELIGIONS OTHER THAN CHRISTIAN ITY THAT IS SO OFTEN FOUND IN BOOKS OF THIS SORT COVERING SO WIDE A FIELD AS IT DOES IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT THE PICTURES OF ISLAM PRESENTED OFTEN SEEM TO ONE NOT FAMILIAR WITH ITS VARIATIONS TO BE DESCRIPTIONS OF DIFFERENT RELIGIONS HAVING LITTLE BESIDES A MONOTHEISTIC CREED IN COMMON THE GENERAL IMPRESSION LEFT ON THE MIND AFTER READING THE BOOK IS OF A POWERFUL RELIGIOUS BELIEF ONLY WAITING FOR EFFICIENT ORGANIZATION TO MAKE IT AN ALMOST IRRESISTIBLE FORCE THEY NEED AN APOSTLE FROM THEIR OWN RANKS A MOHAMMEDAN SCHOLAR ENLIGHTENED BY GODS SPIRIT P 17 BUT THE MAHDI NEVER COMES AND IN THE OPINIONS OF THE AUTHORS IT SEEMS PLAIN THAT UNLESS THE PRESENT CONDITIONS OF IGNORANCE AND SUPERSTITION ARE CHANGED THE MUSSULMAN PEOPLES MUST REMAIN POTENTIALLY POWERFUL BUT ACTUALLY WEAK IN ALL THE MUSSULMAN COUNTRIES THE MOST STRIKING CONTRAST THAT PRESENTS ITSELF TO THE MISSIONARY IS TO SEE THE RELIGIOUS RISING ON THE ONE HAND TO THE CONCEPTION OF A MONOTHEISTIC GOD AND ON THE OTHER SINKING TO FAMILY RELATIONS OF A MOST DEPLOR ABLE CHARACTER THE TREATMENT OF WOMAN IS THE WORST BLOT UPON THE PAGE OF MO HAMMEDAN CIVILIZATION THE POSITION OF THE WIFE IS THAT OF A SERVANT AND THE MAR 631 IGITHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY

ESTABLISHED SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES AND CARRIES ON PROSELYTING PROPAGANDA MUCH ON THE SAME LINES THAT CHRISTIAN MISSIONS FOLLOW WHAT WILL BE THE FINAL EFFECT OF SUCH WORK AS THIS THE AUTHORS OF THESE ESSAYS DO NOT CLEARLY SEE SOME LOOK UPON IT AS PORTENDING A REJUVENATION OF ISLAM ITSELF OTHERS ARE DISPOSED TO WELCOME THE MOVEMENT THROUGH THE BELIEF THAT EDUCATION WILL EFFECTUALLY BREAK DOWN THE BARRIERS TO RAPID SPREAD OF CHRISTIANITY AMONG THE NOW MOHAMMEDAN PEOPLES THE AUTHORS OF THESE ESSAYS MUST ADMIT THAT UP TO THE PRESENT THE RESULTS TANGIBLE OF MISSIONARY EFFORT IN ISLAM ARE MUCH LESS THAN WOULD BE EXPECTED BY THOSE UNACQUAINTED WITH THE PECULIAR DIFFICULTIES OF THE FIELD THE NET RESULT FOR EXAMPLE IN THE CHRISTIAN MISSIONS IN EGYPT FROM THEIR ESTABLISHMENT IN I854 TO I906 WAS IN

DIFFICULT IN THE SPACE OF A SHORT REVIEW TO CONVEY A JUST IDEA OF THE SCOPE AND CHARACTER OF THIS LITTLE BOOK IT DEALS WITH ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT PROBLEMS IN ETHNOLOGY AND IF IT DOES NOT SUCCEED IN REMOVING THE OBSTACLES TO ITS SOLUTION AND REVEALING THE MENTAL ATTITUDE OF THE WEST AFRICAN NEGRO TO THE IDEA OF KINGSHIP AND THE CONCEPTION OF DIVINITY THE EVIDENT SINCERITY OF THE WRITER AND HIS SYMPATHETIC APPEAL ON BEHALF OF A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE BLACK MAN MUST COMMEND HIM BOTH TO THOSE WHOSE INTEREST IN THE BACKWARD RACES OF MANKIND IS PURELY SCIENTIFIC AND TO THOSE WHO DESIRE TO UNDERSTAND THE NEGRO FOR HIS OWN SAKE FOR THE MEN ON WHOM THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR POLITICAL ADMINISTRATION IN WEST AFRICA RESTS THE BOOK IS OF ESPECIAL VALUE BECAUSE THE CHAPTER ON LAW IS PERHAPS THE BEST CONTRI BUTION TO THE SUBJECT OF NEGRO LAW THAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN IN ENGLISH THE CHAPTERS ON PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION THOUGH SOMEWHAT TOO MUCH COLORED BY THE PERSONAL PREDILECTIONS OF THE AUTHOR ARE

TARIFF ON PROSPERITY IN THE COURSE OF THE DISCUSSION HE ATTEMPTS TO SHOW THAT A LARGE GROUP OF OUR MODERN ECONOMIC PROBLEMS ARE DUE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO THE EXISTENCE OF THE TARIFF WHICH IN THE LONG RUN BENEFITS ONLY THE CORPORATIONS WHOSE INTERESTS ARE HIGHLY PROTECTED THE AUTHORS FIRST CONTENTION AND HE SUPPORTS IT VERY STRONGLY IS THAT AMERICAN PRODUCERS ARE EQUIPPED BY VIRTUE OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES THE SUPERIOR DEVELOPMENT OF LABORSAVING MACHINERY AND THE HIGHER GRADE OF THE LABOR FORCE TO UNDERSELL THE ENTIRE WORLD IF GIVEN A FAIR CHANCE WE HAVE MACHINES AND WE USE THEM NOTWITHSTANDING THE SUPERIOR ADVAN TAGES IN RESOURCES EQUIPMENT AND LABOR THE AMOUNTS OF OUR EXPORTS ARE RIDICULOUSLY SMALL AS COMPARED WITH ENGLAND FRANCE AND GERMANY WHY IS THIS TRUE BECAUSE IN SPITE OF OUR GREAT NATURAL RESOURCES AND THE HIGH PRODUCTIVITY OF OUR INDUSTRY EXCESSIVE DUTIES ARE IMPOSED ON A LARGE NUMBER OF ARTICLES INCLUDING RAW MATERIALS WITH THE RESULT THAT OUR MANUFACTURERS ARE UNABLE TO COMPETE WITH MANY FOREIGN GOODS THIS TARIFF WHICH SO RAISES THE COST OF RAW MATERIALS AS TO FORBID THE EXPORTING OF MANY OF OUR MANUFAC TURES IS LIKEWISE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TRUSTS

NOT THEIR PRESENT POWER FOR EVIL BUT THEIR TENDENCY IN THE FUTURE THE CREATION OF THESE GIGANTIC TRUSTS SEEMS TO ME TO LEAD DIRECTLY TO STATE SOCIALISM NOT ONLY DOES THE TARIFF CORRUPT THE COUNTRY THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS OF PROTECTED INTERESTS AND THE FALSE STATEMENTS OF SUBSIDIZED NEWS PAPERS BUT IT GIVES RISE TO SEVERAL SECONDARY FORCES OF CORRUPTION AMONG WHICH MAY BE MENTIONED SPECIAL LEGISLATION THE PRESENCE IN THE NATIONAL TREASURY OF A GREAT SURPLUS REVENUE WHICH CONGRESS MUST SPEND FOREIGN QUARRELS ARISING BECAUSE OF THE PRESENCE OF PROTECTIVE TARIFF AND TARIFF WARS AND MOST SERIOUS OF ALL THE GREAT CENTRALIZATION OF AUTHORITY IN THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE THE AUTHOR THEN DEVOTES THREE CAREFULLY PREPARED CHAPTERS TO TALKS WITH MANUFACTURERS WITH LABORERS AND WITH FARMERS IN EACH CASE BY THOUGHTFUL ARGUMENT AND WELLPREPARED STATISTICS HE SHOWS THAT THE TARIFF IS NOT A BENEFIT BUT A DETRIMENT TO ALL CLASSES EXCEPT THOSE MANUFACTURERS WHO ARE DIRECTLY PROTECTED AND THAT EVEN IN THEIR CASES A TIME WILL COME WHEN THE EXCLU SION FROM FOREIGN MARKETS WILL TELL HEAVILY AGAINST THEM THE LAST CHAPTER DEALS WITH THE REMEDY FOR PRESENT CONDITIONS THUS FAR ISSUES LIKE THE INCOME TAX AND RAILWAY LEGISLATION HAVE BEEN PRESENTED MERELY TO TURN PUBLIC ATTEN TION FROM THE REAL POINT AT ISSUE THE REAL REMEDY AS THE AUTHOR DESCRIBES IT IS FOR PATRIOTIC PEOPLE TO COME TOGETHER NOT AS REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS BUT AS AMERICANS LOVING THEIR COUNTRY ORGANIZE CLUBS AND SOCIETIES AND BATTLE AGAINST THE INTERESTS WHICH CORRUPTLY RULE IT THE BOOK CONTAINS A MOST STARTLING ARRAY OF FACTS CLEARLY THE EQUIP MENT OF AMERICA IN RESOURCES IS OF A CHARACTER WHICH PLACES HER IN A POSITION TO UNDERSELL THE REST OF THE WORLD UNDOUBTEDLY OUR PRESENT TARIFF SYSTEM AFFORDS THE GREATEST PROTECTION TO THE STRONGEST COMBINATIONS OF CAPITAL ONE THING OVER WHICH SOCIALISM HAS EXULTED IS THE CENTRALIZATION OF AUTHORITY IN THE HANDS OF THE PRESIDENT AND OF THE LEADERS OF INDUSTRY FOR TO THEM THIS CENTRALIZATION IS A STEP TOWARD SOCIALISM WHETHER OR NOT ALL OF OUR PUBLIC CORRUPTION CAN BE LAID AT THE DOOR OF THE EXISTENCE OF A HIGH TARIFF IT IS CERTAIN THAT SOME OF THE MANUFACTURERS

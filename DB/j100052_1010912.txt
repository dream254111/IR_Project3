States 17891861 Pp 320 New York Longmans Green  Co 1906 Within the covers of this little volume one hundred and fiftyfive documents are given showing the attitude and action of the different states on national issues both constitutional and political from the formation of the government under the constitution down to the close of the middle period The range of subjects covered by state actions is comprehensive and may be indicated by reference to some of them asthe state action on the federal judiciary replies to Virginia and Kentucky resolutions on embargo acts on the Hartford con vention on tariff and internal improvements on nullification on Missouri contest on abolition on the annexation of Texas on the Wilmot proviso fugitive slaves compromise of i850 on the KansasNebraska act on secession and others The arrangement of these documents is good and the introduc tion and bibliographies on each subject are of great value Dr Ames has done a splendid work in bringing before the student these documents in such a convenient shape Hitherto they were hard to get at scattered so as to be available only to a few There is no doubt that most of the attention of the historian and student has been placed on the federal side of our history forgetting that the states played a large part It is a wonder that such a work was not undertaken long before this We have various collections of select documents and select statutes dealing with national issues from the federal standpoint but this is the first in the field to show the action of the various states on these same issues Students and teachers will be grateful to Dr Ames for bringing within the compass of a single volume documents so widely scattered before and illustrating the action of our states on national issues Ashley P Local and Central Government Pp xi 396 Price 300 New York E P Dutton  Co I906 Reserved for later notice Baker James H American Problems Pp vii 222 Price I20 net New York Longmans Green  Co I907 Professor Baker announces in his preface that he considers The Essential Problems of America to be ethical sociological and educational and that his endeavor in presenting this collection of essays and addresses to the public is to point out the dangers of our country and the evidence of progress In doing this however he has devoted most of his attention to the presentation of ideals after which our national life should be molded 630Book Department and the means whereby progress may be attained Incidentally he makes a stirring appeal to the wellconditioned to do battle against an array of political commercial and social evils emphasizing the value of Christianity education and personal activity The power of Christs leadership is beyond estimate or description p 37 If we could rightly educate and care for one generation of children society would be regenerated p 146 Democracy means selfeffort selfsupport and a tithe of interest time and energy in behalf of ones fellows p 64 We should take for our great examples statesmen with the industry integrity and breadth of Gladstone preachers with the sympathy and strong convictions of Phillips Brooks and reformers with the faith and courage of Wendell Phillips By these means all our most serious problems may be solved To teach a lesson of pessimism to the coming generation would be an untruth and a crime p 16 Besides these general discussions the book contains some chapters on education which will be of much interest to the pedagogically inclined Professor Bakers style is clear and pleasing his large range of illustrations are aptly applied while the general tone of the work is vigorous and even inspiring Baldwin J M Mental Development in the Child and the Race Third Edition Pp xviii 477 Price 225 New York

missionary field compose this book In general the tone of the work shows singularly little of the lack of appreciation of religions other than Christian ity that is so often found in books of this sort Covering so wide a field as it does it is not surprising that the pictures of Islam presented often seem to one not familiar with its variations to be descriptions of different religions having little besides a monotheistic creed in common The general impression left on the mind after reading the book is of a powerful religious belief only waiting for efficient organization to make it an almost irresistible force They need an apostle from their own ranks a Mohammedan scholar enlightened by Gods spirit p 17 But the Mahdi never comes and in the opinions of the authors it seems plain that unless the present conditions of ignorance and superstition are changed the Mussulman peoples must remain potentially powerful but actually weak In all the Mussulman countries the most striking contrast that presents itself to the missionary is to see the religious rising on the one hand to the conception of a monotheistic God and on the other sinking to family relations of a most deplor able character The treatment of woman is the worst blot upon the page of Mo hammedan civilization The position of the wife is that of a servant and the mar 631 igiThe Annals of the American Academy riage rules are so lax that in some parts of Africa it is unusual for a woman of forty to continue in the favor of her husband In some districts however notably in Arabia p 87 the more enlightened classes are beginning to provide an education for theirdaughters and the status of women in general is gradually improving Signs of awakening to a new life are beginning to appear throughout the Mohammedan world Societies for the promotion of education are springing up and societies for the study of the Koranwhich in some coun tries Persia especially was not allowed in the hands of the faithful until recently Notable among these agencies is the Anjuman i Islam or Moslem association for the defense and propagation of Islam This society is especially strong in North India where it has established schools and colleges and carries on proselyting propaganda much on the same lines that Christian missions follow What will be the final effect of such work as this the authors of these essays do not clearly see some look upon it as portending a rejuvenation of Islam itself others are disposed to welcome the movement through the belief that education will effectually break down the barriers to rapid spread of Christianity among the now Mohammedan peoples The authors of these essays must admit that up to the present the results tangible of missionary effort in Islam are much less than would be expected by those unacquainted with the peculiar difficulties of the field The net result for example in the Christian missions in Egypt from their establishment in I854 to I906 was in converts only 140 It is of course unfair to estimate the good work of the missions by this standard alone The good accomplished through the medical dispensaries and by the force of example are items counting largely to their credit In almost every chapter are references to the political unrest that per vades all Mohammedan landsthe feeling of dissatisfaction that has given rise to the New Islam movement growing so rapidly in Turkey and in Egypt As in all books of this character the essays vary greatly in merit Espe cial mention should be made of those treating Arabia and India which are

fail to recognize the battered though regenerated science Bottom himself was not more marvelously translated And still the book is nothing but an argument meandering through two hundred leisurely pages and 633 193The Annals of the American Academy proving that protection is the unique salvation of nations This argument is prefaced by the reconstruction establishing peace between economics and other sciences and stating the corelation of production and consumption in the analogy of a revolving wheel The book reaches an inglorious conclu sion in seven critical and historical chapters reviewing the prerecon structed history of the science from John Stuart Mill down to Bernard Shaw The book is as disproportioned as a monster Vital economic problems are completely disregarded other questions are treated at excessive length The sentences are long the paragraphs Brobdingnagian Many of the paragraphs are from 1500 to 2000 words in length and their specific gravity is in proportion

difficult in the space of a short review to convey a just idea of the scope and character of this little book It deals with one of the most difficult problems in ethnology and if it does not succeed in removing the obstacles to its solution and revealing the mental attitude of the West African negro to the idea of kingship and the conception of divinity the evident sincerity of the writer and his sympathetic appeal on behalf of a better understanding of the black man must commend him both to those whose interest in the backward races of mankind is purely scientific and to those who desire to understand the negro for his own sake For the men on whom the responsibility for political administration in West Africa rests the book is of especial value because the chapter on law is perhaps the best contri bution to the subject of negro law that has been written in English The chapters on philosophy and religion though somewhat too much colored by the personal predilections of the author are compact with data which bear the stamp of very careful observation and which cannot fail to be of value Mr Dennett inclines to the view that the African presents evidence of 634 194Book Department political and social achievement in the past which is lost sight of by those who observe him in his present degenerate condition without reference to the obscure but significant phases of belief which are to be found underlying the grosser phenomena of fetishism and witchcraft The kingly office hedged by all the sacred attributes that attach to it in the early history of civilized peoples was a familiar conception to the black mans mind and the idea of a supreme divinity is still to be found in Nzambi a being who represents a conception which may be compared to the Christian idea of God The main purpose of this contribution to African ethnology is to prove this higher conception of God among the negroes and to show that the kingly office is of vital importance in the government of African communities The half tone illustrations and line drawings add much to the ethnological interest of the book Dopp Katharine E The Later CaveMen Pp I97 Price 45 cents New York RandMcNally Co

rejoice to meet an authoritative account of the boyhood and youth of Mexicos great President The origin of Porfirio Diaz was humble and his early life as full of hardship and poverty as his manhood has been of adventure and romance The determination with which the little halfbreed Indian boy set about obtaining an education while at the same time helping to support his widowed mother and her family foreshadowed the fixity of purpose which has characterized the acts of the grown man 635 I95The Annals of the American Academy The publication is the first of a series to be issued by the

Argentinas Pp 362 Buenos Ayres Angel Estrada y Cia I907 This volume presents a series of studies in which present day economic and political thought is considered In his discussion the author rejects absolutely the idea that there can be any definite theories universally appli cable in these sciences Law religion language economics and politics are purely regional products Since this is true every effort should be made to allow each nation to develop on its own lines Such movements as that for codification of law are to be deprecated They try to mold men to arbitrary forms instead of allowing spontaneous development In Argentine life before separation from Spain there was no true national feeling The large landowner class had little in common with the Spanish tenantry and almost nothing with the mixed and Indian classes The peculiar character of Argentine civilization fostered disrespect of law a large semioutlaw class and on the part of the landowners a feverish preoccupation in the struggle for fortune Trade regulations were disre garded and the smuggler became a respected member of the community All this old basis of national life was changed by the revolution which brought the gradual disintegration of the large farm holdings and later the introduction of many elements from Europe which devoted themselves to tilling the land as opposed to cattle raisingthe occupation of the former Spanish landlord These elements furnished the basis of the modern Argen tine State With the development of Argentine nationality it has become evident that the national bent is toward centralization of authority p 87 The author holds that those who advocate the AngloSaxon idea of individual initiative wherever possible disregard the national predisposition for centralization To implant such a principle it would be necessary to tear forth by the roots the fundamental bases of the Argentine organism Argentine experience must always be considered in relation to the people of whom the nation is composed Without such a viewpoint many of the phenomena of the national life would be completely misunderstood A notable example is the financial history of the republic Banks have been founded by bankrupt states with fiat capital and the banks have prosperedcontradicting all the conclusions of classic science The reason for this success the author maintains lies in the boundless confidence of the Argentine in its own future The first third of the volume treats of the general field of Argentine social sciences One cannot help but feel that the tone is distinctly national so much so that at times it leads the author to reach conclusions which an outside observer could not admit As a whole however a body of facts is given which cast a very interesting and instructive light on Argentine life The latter portion of the book is given over to a study of the develop ment of the legal system of Spain One cannot but wish that the Argentine 636 i96Book Department practice had been treated more in detail even if the discussion of the early development of the law in Spain would thereby become more summary Garcia J A La Ciudad Indiana Pp 375 Buenos

passed into literature as learned Cordova proud Toledo gay Seville and slumbering Granada The essays are appropriately dedicated To all who love Spain among whom the author amply demonstrates she must be numbered The sympathetic touch with which the glories of the past and the decay of the present the airy grace of Moorish civilization and the careless indolence of its Spanish successor are brought out proves that the author is herself acquainted with both Spanish history and those traits of the presentday life of the peninsula which always make a trip through Spain an event never to be forgotten There is present throughout the pages the attitude of the philosopher who when looking into a peoples life as mir rored in their creations tries to see back of the image to understand the

I906 Professor Haynes timely work on The Election of Senators is made up of four parts i The adoption of the present system 2 the character of the senate and its effect on legislation and on state legislatures 3 the growth of the movement for the direct election of senators and 4 an elaborate pre sentation of the arguments for and against the proposed change These argu ments take up about onehalf of the book and notwithstanding the fact that the author is an open advocate of the movement the reader is kept in doubt of his personal views until the concluding chapter so impartially are the opposing arguments presented Mr Haynes very properly warns us that those who are expecting a regenerated senate as a result of the change will in all probability be disappointed Of one thing however he is confident that the change will bring unmixed good to the several states As every one knows the members of the constitutional convention assumed the several legislatures would deliberate upon the fitness of various candidates and that out of such discussions the first citizens of the several states would become members of the senate The system broke down rather early and today senators are usually selected some time in advance of the meeting of the legislature either by some primary election device or as a result of bargains and compromises among the party leaders In either case the author believes their direct election would be an improvement for it would put the responsi bility where it ultimately rests that is upon the individual voters Under such circumstances if the states are misrepresented in the senate the blame cannot as at present be shifted to the legislatures but must be shouldered by the voters At the same time the several state legislatures freed from the bickerings and bargains so often attending the election of senators would be enabled to devote themselves exclusively to the purpose for which they primarily exist viz state legislation On the whole Professor Haynes work deserves a hearty welcome for he has succeeded in the difficult task of writing a book which the layman can understand and which is at the same time worthy the attention of

amount of goods produced and transported and the improvement of methods by which this increased production is accomplished The course of this development since the industrial revolution is briefly reviewed German industry before 1871 was far behind that of Great Britain and the United States due to the wars on the Continent the many petty states with their varied restrictions on trade and meager transportation and bank ing facilities Since 1871 however the states have become a nation with uniform tariff regulations and a railway system which has been operated more and more as a unit

well as a summary of older conceptions The style is clear but in many sections so many highly technical terms are used that the lay reader will be in trouble The concluding chapter at least however should be carefully read by all who are dealing with problems of human progress Great emphasis is laid upon the work of Mendel who the author believes has started students on the track which will finally explain many of the mysteries of heredity He believes that the theory of the inheritance of acquired characteristics must be given up Louis Paul Histoire du Mouvement Syndical en France Pp 282 Price 350 fr Paris Felix Alcan I907 The author attempts in this work to present the history of trade unionism in France First he discusses his idea of union psychology bringing out the numerous cases of infidelity to class interest the factional quarrels of which the unionists are guilty the smallness of the dues which the French unionists are willing to pay and the fact that in France in distinct contrast with England and Germany there is very little of the altruistic spirit which leads a union leader to devote his time and energy practically without com pensation to the cause of the working classes The last chapter of the book follows logically this explanation of union psychology by explaining at some length the doctrines of the modern trade union including general strikes legislative action and the trend toward socialism The intervening chapters are devoted to an explanation of the rise of the trade union from its first suggestion in the latter part of the eighteenth century to the international groupings of laborers of the present day The author treats his subject in a very interesting manner although at times the minuteness of the detail suggests scientific study rather than a work designed for popular reading He points out the fact that until recently trade unions have not only been discouraged by the laws but fought bitterly by the government officials In this France presents a very distinct parallel to England To us in America the most significant point brought out is the tendency of the modern French union toward a radical form of socialism 640 200Book

which is stated by the author to be the technology of happiness applied being book three of The Economy of Happiness is an attempt to solve a number of our modern problems through a form of social

criticising harshly modern methods of production and distribution and the schemes that have been advanced to alter them the author expounds his doctrinewhich he says differs from socialismunder the name Pantocracythe control of human activities in the interest of all The mechanism for bringing about this Pantocracy has eight different features I Public ownership of the means of production Retention of the wage system and abolition of profit 2 Organization of a system of distri bution whereby supply of and demand for products may be adjusted 3 Organization of a national labor exchange 4

sets out to write of mines and mining stock must be prepared to face the charge of being a propagandist The author of this book cannot avoid the imputation when consideration is taken of the detailed descriptions of the various mining projects of presentday Mexico and their prospects The glowing pictures of the future of our southern neighbor due to her mineral wealth quite carries the reader away and puts him in a spirit to give willing belief to the prophecy of the late Cecil Rhodes that Mexico will one day furnish the gold silver and copper of the world her subterranean treasure will build the empires of tomorrow and make future cities of this world veritable New Jerusalems There is here however more than a picture conjured up by the fertile imagination of the promoter The official statistics from the Mexican treasury and the photographs of the mining establishments now in operation show that these mines have an enviable past history and substantial present foundation in addition to the future which is the common property of all such enterprises The story of what has been done and the discussions of present conditions in the Mexican labor market and in industry are the features that render the book valuable 641 201The Annals of the American Academy These subjects are treated in an interesting manner and so far as the reader can judge with impartiality and accuracy One can hardly realize the extent to which Mexico contributed to Spanish wealth until confronted by the surprising figures which the mint records yield The statements that the mother vein at Guanajuato has as shown in the government records given a yield to date of Iooooooooo in silver that one area of Ioooo feet has produced 8000000oo and that Mexico has for four hundred years contributed about threefifths of the total amount of the worlds silver are indicative of the importance of this region as a source of our silver supply Nor is the output at present on the decline indeed the author firmly believes that the future will prove that the past has only given earnest of what will be accomplished in this region At present the output of all precious metals is steadily growing In I8778I the silver production was 106762192 Mexican and in I90205 213458584 an increase of over 20o per cent in twentyeight years The output of gold copper and lead also show striking increase New processes modern machinery foreign capital and increasing politi cal stability are the bases upon which the present growth is founded Another factor not to be forgotten is the Mexican peon who with all his deficiencies is a cheap laborer at 75 cents Mexican per day The book brings the reader into close touch with the forces which are making a new Mexico of old Mexico and though one cannot but suspect that hopes as well as facts have occasionally influenced the authors conclusions yet as a whole the facts presented seems to fully justify the inferences drawn Fortysix excellent

He has therefore pre pared a book in which under the above title he points out the various powers and duties which are imposed by the constitution There is nothing in the book regarding the theory of the government which is not known or at least taught in the early grades of the American high school but it is interesting to note one impression which the author emphasizes at great length To him the United States Government differs from all others because under it power is vested in the people and they are sovereign and supreme Abroad this is reversed and some other power is sovereign as the Emperor in Japan or the Parliament in England Only in America is sovereignty vested in the people In his discussions the author fails to take into account current problems but quotes at length from the Federalist and from Supreme Court decisions In doing this he has no perspective view of modern conditions For example he says that the power to establish a uniform rule of naturalization is among the most important of the powers conferred upon Congress and he then devotes twelve pages to the question of naturalization while the clause giving Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce is dismissed with four pages of brief comment To the average American student the book is a primer of the simplest type To the foreign lawyer who wishes to become familiar with the theo retical side

that faroff land Mr Penfield writes of the Orient as an observer who plans for all he sees closer relations with his home country the United States An avowed believer in forward politics he looks for the adoption by the United States of a comprehensive policy favoring the development of foreign markets One of the prime factors in this development must be the building up of a merchant marine able to win from our European competitors our just share of the worlds carrying trade Only thus can the greatest benefits of the Panama canal be reaped for the author asserts that the interests of foreign powers will prompt them to choose other routes in all cases where the impelling force of self interest is not decidedly in favor of the Panama route South America and the East lie ready for our exploitation but even the excellence of the goods we have to offer cannot bring us economic dominion unless we are able also to control the means of communication This is the attitude of mind which reappears repeatedly throughout the 644 204Book Department bookthe longing for a greater America which shall realize that the oceans connect her with the remote parts of the earth not separate her from them With this background we are led through a series of vivid and sympathetic interpretations of various phases of oriental life which are characteristic and furnish strong contrasts to our western civilization Ceylon with its tea farms and pearl fisheries the crowded capitals of India the commercial emporium of the Straits Settlements and the awakening trade centers of China are portrayed with a skill which insures that the readers interest shall never lag The closing chapters discuss the world ambitions in the Far East of Germany and Japan in their relation to the prospects of the United States The interests of Germany the author considers to be diametrically opposed to those of the United States and Japan Emperor William was a staunch friend of Russia because He saw a prosperous Germany if the Slav crushed the yellow man p 297 and In his heart the Kaiser loathes the doctrine of Monroe that is obvious p 298 The interests of Japan and the United States will lead both to adopt the same policy in the Far East Japan may ulti mately control the larger portion of the trade of the Far East but for the present Every land in Asia east of Singapore can be commercially exploited by the United States more easily than by any other people The book closes with a review of the present economic position of Japan and a prophecy of a brilliant future for her as one of the worlds first powers Pierce Franklin The Tariff and the Trusts Pp ix 387 Price I50 net New York Macmillan Co I907 Under this title the author a New York lawyer deals with the effect of our protective tariff on prosperity In the course of the discussion he attempts to show that a large group of our modern economic problems are due directly or indirectly to the existence of the tariff which in the long run benefits only the corporations whose interests are highly protected The authors first contention and he supports it very strongly is that American producers are equipped by virtue of the natural resources the superior development of laborsaving machinery and the higher grade of the labor force to undersell the entire world if given a fair chance We have machines and we use them Notwithstanding the superior advan tages in resources equipment and labor the amounts of our exports are ridiculously small as compared with England France and Germany Why is this true Because in spite of our great natural resources and the high productivity of our industry excessive duties are imposed on a large number of articles including raw materials with the result that our manufacturers are unable to compete with many foreign goods This tariff which so raises the cost of raw materials as to forbid the exporting of many of our manufac tures is likewise responsible for the trusts Detailed descriptions are given of the Borax Trust the Glass Trust and the Steel Trust showing how the tariff is responsible for their power and the high price of their products Forty other industrial combinations are men tioned all of which to a greater or less degree owe their origin and growth 645 205The Annals of the American Academy to the same cause The most serious feature of these trusts is not their present power for evil but their tendency in the future The creation of these gigantic trusts seems to me to lead directly to state socialism Not only does the tariff corrupt the country through the legislative efforts of protected interests and the false statements of subsidized news papers but it gives rise to several secondary forces of corruption among which may be mentioned special legislation the presence in the national treasury of a great surplus revenue which Congress must spend foreign quarrels arising because of the presence of protective tariff and tariff wars and most serious of all the great centralization of authority in the National Executive The author then devotes three carefully prepared chapters to talks with manufacturers with laborers and with farmers In each case by thoughtful argument and wellprepared statistics he shows that the tariff is not a benefit but a detriment to all classes except those manufacturers who are directly protected and that even in their cases a time will come when the exclu sion from foreign markets will tell heavily against them The last chapter deals with the remedy for present conditions Thus far issues like the income tax and railway legislation have been presented merely to turn public atten tion from the real point at issue The real remedy as the author describes it is for patriotic people to come together not as Republicans or Democrats but as Americans loving their country organize clubs and societies and battle against the interests which corruptly rule it The book contains a most startling array of facts Clearly the equip ment of America in resources is of a character which places her in a position to undersell the rest of the world Undoubtedly our present tariff system affords the greatest protection to the strongest combinations of capital One thing over which socialism has exulted is the centralization of authority in the hands of the President and of the leaders of industry for to them this centralization is a step toward socialism Whether or not all of our public corruption can be laid at the door of the existence of a high tariff it is certain that some of the manufacturers of New England do not feel the benefits of the tariff for they have protested bitterly against it As to the authors remedy it is one for which the country is not at present prepared men are too busy making money But the formation of a patriotism party whose efforts shall be directed to destroying all of the evils of our present system including the bad parts of our present tariff is a proposition that sooner or later the American people will be called upon to consider Porter R P The Dangers of Municipal Ownership Pp xi 349 Price I80 New York Century Co 90o7 Reserved for later notice Prentice E

Albert Stickneys new book is a protest against our present machine politics Our political system has been turned into one vast election machine and instead of real control by the people we have today government by the election machine This condition is due to our system of electing our officials for a specified term and then at the end of that period electing a new set of officials The cost has been great Back in the early days President Lincoln was constrained by the strength of the party organization to appoint Cameron Secretary of War with the result that generals were appointed for political reasons Lincoln did not intentionally betray his trust but was simply out of place He was a great orator with the high purposes of a statesman But he had no appreciation of the men and methods needed for the conduct of the war The government needed at its head a man with the gifts and training of an executive We wanteda leader We hada mil stone p 142 Mr Stickney enumerates also our enormous outlay for pensions and estimates that I38Ioooooo has been stolen from the United States Treasury by fraud on the part of officials As to the Panama Canal two other routes are bettera ship railway across Tehuantepec and the Darien route With the increased speed of construction under modern mechanical methods it would seem highly probable that the Darien route could be completely finished for use within one or two years p 189 The remedy in Mr Stickneys belief lies in a radical reorganization of our political system I In the city the mayor should be elected for an indefinite term and be removable at any time 2 Abolish the secret ballot and adopt instead a system of election by public deliberationa return to the use of the public meeting p 92 and a system of viva voce voting which enables the wise and upright to influence their fellow citizens by argument and their own example 3 Consolidate the two houses of Congress into onea single popular assembly Give men sufficient power and depend upon them to exercise it well Abolish the term limit for members of the Assem bly Congress and give them power to remove the President by a two thirds vote This will abolish the Senatorial trust p 262 with its perni cious system of patronage Have subsequent elections for members of the new Congress and for President only when there shall be vacancies This will enable the members to give all their time to public interests The author has grasped a large and fundamental fact of our political lifeat least one phase of itand his book is suggestive and valuable in parts In other parts it is full of repetition and lacking in clearness The sharp criticism of President Lincoln which our regard for him would not stifle if deserved seems to arise from a confusion of thought If the case is against the party machine there would seem to be no need to attack the 648 208Book Department Executive whom the machine compelled to appoint a partisan and it is strange to hear Lincoln described in the same sentence as a statesman and a millstone Mr Stickneys advocacy of a return to the public meeting seems funda mentally in error In the face of the present widespread movement in exactly the opposite directionfor primary elections are simply nominations by secret ballotto maintain that no man is ever deterred by publicity from voting for men who are reputable and respectable is to assert a theo retical condition rather than a fact He fails to observe that the election machine so reprobated is responsible for a condition where secrecy is protection and not opposed to the genius of free democratic institutions The secret ballot has been won at a cost of much time and effort and its principle is being still further extended The thoughtful reader of

authors examine the various aspects of French housing conditions with the view of indicating existing evils and ascertaining methods of improve ment Unsanitary houses and overcrowding especially the latter are found to be the cardinal defects in the present situation The book summarizes the results of the variously organized methods of private initiative in attempting to solve the housing problem and points out the varying character of the results achieved Past legislation upon the subject is reviewed and special attention given to the law of I9o6 which facilitates the construction of houses intended for a single family only De fects in the law are designated and a chapter is devoted to the discussion of foreign legislation The role of the local community in determining housing conditions is examined and more extensive work along the line of direct construction of houses advocated Certain exemptions from taxation would also favor a more rapid increase of appropriate houses The recent attempt of Paris to work out a resolution of the problem is discussed and sugges tions for further remedial measures are made In view of the gravity of the present evils the authors contend that more aggressive action is neces sary than present laws imply and that the physical and moral welfare of a large mass of people is involved Webb James H Editor Outlines of Criminal Law Pp xxi 404 Price 300 New York The Macmillan Co I9o7 This volume is a revision adapted for American scholars of the second edition of the wellknown work of Courtney Stanhope Kenny of the Univer sity of Cambridge The

volume is chiefly designed as a textbook for law students It is admirably adapted for this purpose Its usefulness will however be greater for a large number of persons who wish to know more definitely about criminal law will find this manual very valuable Granting its value nothing could more clearly show the difficult straits into which our criminal law and procedure have fallen than this manual designed for the instruction of those who are to handle cases in court The truth is that our criminal law is a collection of more or less important rules arbitrarily established and lacking scientific bases The book is excellent the system abominable By all means study criminal lawbut first study criminology If the careful reader is not convinced that what is needed is a sweeping reform of present

Municipal League Pp 502 I906 Perhaps the most notable feature of this volume is its rational optimism notable because in a field of American political activity which a few years ago was the pessimists prime source of inspiration optimism appears as the interpreter of the age The utterances of this conference from its beginning to its end emphasize the passing of that fear of democracy which a decade ago caused honest but discouraged citizens to sigh for the authority which rightly or wrongly was identified with successful municipal government abroad The cure for democracy is more democracy as forcibly quoted by the editor of the volume at the meeting of the United Cities Conference in Chicago last winter No one who has followed thoughtfully the develop ments of the last decade can have failed to note the progress of this senti ment The Atlantic City conference emphasized in the second place the con viction that present political forms do not in general adequately subserve the legitimate objects of democratic municipal government and from every corner of the land was voiced a determination to correct abuse and to go about in an orderly fashion the remodeling of machinery The specific reforms for which the members of the National Municipal League almost unani mously stand include municipal home rule divorcing of municipal from state and national politics extension of the merit principle to all appointive offices reduction of the number of elective municipal offices free nomination either by petition or direct primaries and finally the reform and systemati zation of municipal accounting 650 210Book Department A third and perhaps the most hopeful of the many hopeful features of this conference was the desire on all sides for exchange of experience and for genuine cooperation This desire is the more significant since a considerable number of the members of the league ly the action of the voters or of the appointing powers in their several cities have ceased to be mere propa gandists and are trying in responsible official positions to apply some of the principles for which the league has stood The whole essence of the volume as well as of present tendencies is aptly epitomized in the following quotation from Professor Rowes sane and excellent paper on the value of foreign experience with municipal owner ship and operation The American people must sooner or later develop a new concept of popular government in which the prominent factor will not be the election of officials but rather that control of organized public opinion over the administration of public affairs which is after all the essential element of a vigorous democracy p 286 At the time this review appears some of the reasons for especial optimism noted in the editors report of practical progress pp 78 to 123 will perhaps seem to many to have lost a part of their forcethe reviewer refers to such events as the recent election in Philadelphia To the great mass who observe the surface of things failure to carry elections is synonymous with failure of reform If there were some organ in whose columns men who look beneath the surface could find reliable data popular impressions when errone ous could be more easily corrected and important municipal events wherever they occur could be discussed throughout the country with better opportunity for correct interpretation Each appearance of this highly useful volume emphasizes but does not meet the need for a quarterly or bimonthly maga zine devoted exclusively to municipal affairs With the tremendous forces organized and unorganized making for civic improvement it is to be sincerely deplored that in America such an organ no longer exists REVIEWS Baldwin James Mark Mental Development in the Child

which furnishes the principles with which they must work Works in psychology which aim at setting forth these principles of mental growth and action therefore deserve the attention of students of

deserves therefore more than a passing notice especially as it has not been superseded since its first publication by any similar work The works of no other psychologist of today it may be added have

lectures on the state of affairs on the Wongo which ere recently published in the form of a pamphlet The following notes are taken from this publication The cstablishmellt of easy communication between the upper ancl lower Iongo is of vital im portance for the development of western Central Africa therefore the Kongo Industrial and Trading Company has taken active measures for the establishment of good roads A few mollths ago an expedition was sent out to study the feasibility of a railroad leading to Stanley Pool After five months of hard work a hun lred miles of the proposed road were surveyed The whole dis trict to be traversed by the road was mapped on a scale of I 2500 vith fivemetre contourlines After this work was completed the expedition which is commanded by Captain ambier proceeded nland to make a reconnaissance ancl survey of the upper part of the road After this preliminaly survey has been made the line will be located and resurveyed It is expected that this work will be completed this year and the company expects to make its detailed plans and estimates in the beginning of next year So far no serious difficulties have been met with As the railroad will not 4e completed for a few years the company has made an attempt to organize regular caravans for carrying the trade between Matadi and the Pool At present sixty thousand loads of sixtyfive pounds each are transportect by carriers through the clistrict of the cata racts As this method of transportation is expensive and unsafe it has been proposed to use cattle instead of men With this aim in view attempts have been made to raise cattle and have heen found to be successful and it is hoped that by this means the cost of transportation will be greatly climinished RThile the railroad is being surveyed M Delcommune has been sent on a comrnercial reconnaissance of the upper Iongo In March he started on the steamer  Roi des Beges  up the Kassai The pamphlet is accom panied by a sketchmap of the Kongo Free State by A T Wau ters showing the present state of our knowledge of this vast terri tory A number of special maps show the situations of the im poltant stations and the route along the Iongo from Matadi to Leopoldville THE KASSAI The observations of Captain Thys on the Kassai and its principal tributary the Lulua have been published by the Institut National de Geographie at Brussels in the form of a large map on a scale of I 200000 The map is mainly intended for the use of steamers going up and down the Kassai and Lulua and the notes on the character of the rivers and their banks have been care Eully compiled from the observations of Captain Thys and of Wiss rnann While this map is particularly valuable on account of the large amount of detail it contains Dr B Hassensteins map of the San liuru which was published in the July number of Petermlanns MzttezSngen must be considered one of the most important con tributions to the geography of Africa In it the surveys of Dr Ludwig Wolf in I886 hand those of Wissmann and Frangois in 88485 have leen made use of The astronomical observations of these travellers have been carefully scrutinized and the final re sults obtained by Hassenstein must be considered the most prob able considering the present state of OUI knowledge The con struction of the upper part of the Lulua is based upon the longi ttlde of Mukenge near Luluaburg which has a probable error of 7 The barometer observations have been reducecl and a great number of eleations are contained in the map The scale of the latter is I 600000 and a considerable amount of detail is given The great value of this pululication becornes obvious when compar ing it with the preliminarr maps compiled frorn the sursreys of these trasrellers BOOKRERIENVS 1 GsZ Zo tSe StXGy of the Azsto avzd the Cosstzttzov oJ the UtzZed StzzZes BY WILLIASI W RUPERT I3oston Ginn I2 THE first part of this book presents a selection of topics cover illg the NZhole period of American history ancl accompanied by a atlmerous list of authorities the whole being designed as a guicle to young stuclents The author remarks in his preface that  young persons are incapable of distinguishing between important ancl unimportant historical facts ancl therefore need guilance in the study of such facts Tllis is undoubtedly true but unfortunately Mr Rupert is not always successful in making the required distinc tion himself for he gives altogether too much attention to military affairs and too little to some political and social events of far greater importance In other respects hosvever his work is well done The second part of the book is a brief exposition of the Constitution giving an explanation of its provisions and in some cases the reasons why they were enacted The decisions of the Supreme Court on questions of constitutional law are not given probably because they were deemed sornewhat beyond the prov ince of a schoolbook but the authors exposition so far as it goes seems well aclaptecl to the wants of students in the high schools NOTES AND NEWS IN the OverZand MortASy for September is a short paper on orangeculture by Mr

direct the telescope with the carnera attached to it towards the moon and to adjust it so as to follow the motion of the latter The effect is that the stars are representel as short lines while any satellite whose motion would probably be in ac cordance with that of the rnoon would appear as a point or a line SCI ENCE

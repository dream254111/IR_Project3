cumstances the Kansas court allows an action by the holder on the contract made in his behalf It seems that in the principal case the right of the holder of the check against the bank was purely equitable arising out of the peculiar circumstances of the case In the socalled Code states where the practice and pleading at law and in equity is the same the distinction between equitable and legal rights is often lost sight of Peculiar circumstances may often give rise to equitable rights without violating the settled rules of the common law CARRIERSCONSTITUTIONAL LAvWREGULATION BY COMMISSIONSALE OF MILEAGE BooKsThe defendant voluntarily put on sale mileage or penny scrip books at a rate less than the maximum rate fixed by the commis sion which were good for passage only when exchanged for a ticket The commission issued an order requiring all railroads selling mileage or penny scrip books to pull them on the trains of the company selling the same when presented by the holders for transportation between points wholly within the state Held this is a valid regulation and is not an interference with the freedom of contract Railroad Commission of Ga v L  N Ry Co Ga 80 S E 327 It is settled that there is no absolute liberty of contract and limita tions thereon by police regulations of the state are frequently nec essary in the interest of public welfare and do not violate the freedom of contract guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment Frisbie v U S 157 U S 160 Schmidinger v Chicago 226 U S 578 This is of course subject to the qualification that such regulation must not be so arbi trary or unreasonable as to amount to a denial of due process of law or a taking of private property for public use without just compensa tion Stone v Trust Co 116 U S 307 Smyth v Ames 169 U S 466 Therefore common carriers from the public nature of the business car ried on by them and the interest which the public has in their operation are subject as to their intrastate business to state regulation which may be exerted either directly by the legislature or by admin istrative bodies endowed with power to that end Gladson v Minn 166 U S 427 A C L Ry Co v N C Corp Corn 206 U S 1 This power to regulate common carriers still exists even though such reg ulations may to some extent affect the power to contract L  N Ry 487VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW Co v Mottley 219 U S 467 Stephens v Central Ry Co 138 Ga 625 75 S E 1041 42 L R A N S 541 It is also settled however that where a state has fixed a reasonable maximum rate it cannot compel railroad companies to sell mileage or penny scrip books at a less rate as this would be an unjustifiable in terference with their freedom of contract Lake Shore Ry Co v Smith 173 U S 684 Cor v A C L Ry Co 106 Va 61 55 S E 572 117 Am St Rep 983 7 L R A N S 1086 It is also established that by purchasing a reduced rate ticket when an opportunity is given to pur chase an ordinary ticket the passenger enters into and is bound by a contract with the carrier different from that implied by law upon the purchase of an ordinary ticket at the regular rate of fare Bittermant v Railway Co 207 U S 205 Mason v Railroad 159 N C 183 75 S E 25 Where the carrier has authority to issue mileage books and such au thority is unaccompanied by any restrictions as to the manner of us ing the carrier may attach any conditions to the sale of such mileage books as it sees fit Eschner v Penn Ry Co 18 I C C 60 Neverthe less it would seem that the state in the exercise of its police power could impose reasonable regulations as to the manner of using mile age or penny scrip books L  N Ry Co v Mottley supra Stephens v Central Ry Co supra CARRIERSINJURY TO PULLMAN PORTERCONTRACT LIMITATION OF LIA BILITYA porter on a palace car employed under a

OF ANY IN MY TIME NOT ONE MONTH BUT WHAT HAD THE WEATHER OF ALL THE SEASONS IN IT AND THAT NOT BY GRADUAL TRANSITIONS BUT BY SUDDEN JERKS SUMMER WAS DRY AUGUST WAS AS COLD AS WINTER SEPTEMBER FULL OF GREAT CHANGES HENCE THAT SUDDEN AND GENERAL CATARRH IN OCTOBER SUCCEEDED IN THE LATTER END OF THE MONTH AND ALL NOVEMBER BY A FATAL DIARRHAEA AMONG THE POOR FROM NOVEMBER 29 TO DECEMBER 5 WAS MILD AND WARM CLOUDY AND CLEAR MIXT LIKE SPRING WEATHER THE WIND DAILY VEERING FROM SOUTH TO NORTHWEST AND EVERY NIGHT FALLING BACK TO SOUTHWEST OR SOUTH DECEMBER 5 AT FIVE OCLOCK AT NIGHT THE SKY ROUND626 ROUND THE HORIZON WAS VERY CLOUDY AND CLEAR IN THE ZENITH THE WEST QUARTER WAS ALL OF A DEEP BLOOD RED COLOUR WITH STREAMERS OF A VERY BEAUTIFUL LIGHT RED NOT RUNNING OR DANCING WITH SUDDEN OCCURSIONS AND MIXTURES LIKE THE AURORAE BOREALES BUT WAVING LIKE VAPOURS TOWARD THE ZENITH BY NORTHWEST TO NORTH ALL THE CLOUDS IN THE INTERIM WERE OF A VERY DARK RED COLOUR EXCEPT THAT IN THE WEST WHICH WAS OF A DEEP BLOODRED AFTER IT HAD CONTINUED SOME TIME THERE THE SAME APPEARED IN THE NORTH UNDER THE CLOUDS FROM WHENCE THESE STREAMERS CAME WAS A BRIGHTNESS SUPERIOR TO THAT OF A FULL MOON THEN BOTH NORTH AND WEST SENT FORTH THEIR BLOODLIKE STREAMERS ONE TOWARD THE OTHER WHICH PASSED ONE ANOTHER AND CAME TO THEIR OP POSITE FUNDS BEFORE THEY WERE QUITE SPENT BETWEEN SEVEN AND EIGHT AT NIGHT THE SCENE

QUARTER THESE STREAMERS CAME THEY ISSUED OUT OF A THICK DEEPRED CLOUD UNDER WHICH WAS HID SO LUMINOUS A BODY THAT I COULD HAVE EASILY READ ON A LARGE CHURCH BIBLE 2 THESE STREAMERS DIFFERED FROM THOSE OF ALL PRE CEDING AURORAE BOREALES 1 THAT THEY WERE NOT WHITE AN DCLEAR BUT A BRIGHT RED LIKE THE SURFACE OF AR627 ARTERIAL OR PULMONARY BLOOD 2 THEY WERE NOT SMALL OR NARROW BUT BROAD LIKE THE MILKY WAY IN A FROSTY NIGHT 3 THEY DID NOT DART OR FLY SWIFTLY FROM THE FUND OR LUMINOUS CLOUD BUT MOVED SLOWLY THEN STOOD STILL SOME SPACE OF TIME THEN SENT OUT THIN RED VAPOURS THROUGH WHICH THE SKY AND STARS WERE VISIBLE THESE QUICKLY SPENT THEMSELVES AND VANISHED 4 NOT ONLY WERE THEIR FUNDS RED BUT THE WHOLE CLOUDS WERE THICK AND OF A DEEP FIRY RED 3 THEY WERE ABOVE THE REGION OF THE WINDS FOR THOUGH THE LAST WAS SOUTHWEST YET THEY MOVED FROM NORTH TO WEST AS QUICKLY AS FROM WEST TO NORTH 4 WHILST THE SKY ON THE ZENITH WAS OF THE COM MON AZURE BLUE THAT IN THE SOUTH ON THE OPENING OF THE CLOUDS WAS A DEEP BLUISH GREEN LIKE GRASS 5 THE WHOLE TIME WAS ATTENDED WITH AN EXTRA ORDINARY HEAT OF THE AIR FOR THE SEASON FOR I WAS OBLIGED TO STRIP TO THE SHIRT THOUGH ABROAD IN THE AIR ALL THE

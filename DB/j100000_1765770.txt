to comply with the wishes of the empress of the Russias and am sure it could be readily shown Their publication is praiseworthy and carefully made but it does not offer any new material on CentralAmerican dialects in the sense of new stocks Two of the Maya dialects the socalled Pupuluca and Subinha are slightly different from those already known and the language termed Lean y Mulia  is the same as what we know from other sources under the more appropriate name Xicaque The vocabularies include the Chapanec of Chiapas and several Costa Rican dialects though the majority are branches of the Maya family An Anatomical Criterion to Distinguish Male from Female Skulls It has long been most earnestly desired to discover some ana tomical feature which would enable us to distinguish the skulls of the sexes Two years ago Virchow declared that all alleged modes of differentiation so far discovered were worthless Very lately Dr ThiemCottbus in the Archiv fuir Klinische Chirurgie Band 37 describes what seems a satisfactory craniological cri terion of sex The os tympanicum forms part of the posterior wall of the glenoid cavity of the inferior maxillary and also closes in front and below the bony meatus of the ear It arises perpendicularly from the petrous portion of the temporal bone posteriorily and turns backward in the woman at about half the height of the mastoid process but in man at a less height In the male the bone developes a sharp edge which divides to form the sheath of the styloid process but in woman this sharpened edge does not exist the bone is rounded into a tubercular form and the fossa is shallower and flatter Thus in the male this fossatympanicostylomastoidea is small and the posterior wall of the glenoid cavity extends so deep that it is not possible for the condyloid process to slip over it In the female it is so much more spacious that this feature alone will serve to distinguish the crania of one sex from the other and it also explains the surgical fact that luxation backward of the in ferior maxillary is observed only in women An Etruscan Ritual Book Before Rome was founded the powerful federation of the Etruscans had spread an advanced civilization over central Italy capping her hilltops with fortifications whose impregnable walls still bid defiance to time But by the beginning of our era the Etruscan people and language and religion had disappeared leaving no testimony but their tombs From these some five thousand inscriptions have been copied but they tell us little Not a single word of the language has been identified beyond per adventure The Etruscan religion profoundly modified that of Rome They were a literary people and in very early times wrote numerous religious books These are referred to by Livy as works of di vination fatales libri and by Cicero as books of ritual Etrusco rum rituales libri or as Etruscan documents chartce Etruscce and even in the latters day they were in use by the Roman priesthood It seems an incredible piece of good fortune that one such Etruscan Ritual Book should turn up in fair preservation in the year 1891 but such seems to be the case Two or three centu ries BC a mummifier of Alexandria bought a lot of waste paper and old rags for use in his business and employed some of it in wrapping the corpse of a young lady About 1849 her mummy was brought to Austria and last year in her wrappings this Etruscan book was identified by Professor Krall The Vienna Academy of Sciences has undertaken its publication and on its appearance I shall return again to its curious history and char acter Ethnography of the Finns One of the most interesting questions in the ethnic history of the north of Europe is that concerned with the origin and migra I73 tion of the Finns They are ancient settlers as they were known to the Romans of the time of Tacitus as dwellers on the Baltic Sea In language they are first cousins of the Magyars of Hun gary and also of the Samoyeds of Siberia Indeed some main tain that their name Suomi is from the same radical as  Samoyed Those resident in Finland proper rarely show any marked Mon golian appearance as I can say from personal observation but their strain is deeply Aryanized A much less familiar branch of them are the Sirieni or Syranen who dwell in northeastern Russia on both slopes of the Ural Mountains extending east to the valley of the river Ob on which the town of Muji is one of their principal resorts in latitude 65 north This group has been carefully studied by M Stephen Sommier whose volume  Sirieni Ostiacchi e Samoiedi dellOb appeared a few years ago in Florence From numerous anthropometrical measurements he carried out he satisfactorily showed that the Sirieni are Germanized Finns quite like their relatives on the Baltic and differing widely from the Ostiaks and Voguls to the east It is probable indeed that the Sirieni who are much given to trading and wandering are an offshoot of the western branch of the stock rather than the eastern NOTES AND NEWS THE sixth annual convention of the Association of American Agricultural Colleges and Experiment Stations will meet in New Orleans La

for some time He is specially fitted for the task and the index to this faithful reprint of the Philadelphia edition of 1814 will be of great scientific value  Harper  Brothers will soon publish an interesting work by Walter Besant entitled  London which will not be a history of the city as a body politic but the story of the life of the people at different periods from the earliest historical records to the times of the Georges and will be fully illustrated  Edward Stern  Co Philadelphia will publish at once In Arctic Seas by Dr R N Keely in which the author who ac companied in the

Court Chicago I111 began the publi cation of a series of articles by Mr Charles S Peirce to be enti tled The Critic of Arguments The word critichere means an art like logic This series will be devoted to a critical and his torical discussion of the methods of reasoning Mr Charles S Peirce is one of the most distinguished scholars and mathemati cians of which America boasts But especially in the depart ment of modern logic has his work contributed perhaps more than that of any other living investigator to the permanent ad vancement of science The results of his thought are however for the most part locked up in the proceedings and reports of learned societies and now for the first time in The Open Court are they to be presented in a less rigid and technical form and made accessible to all who place a value on right thinking SEPTEMBER 23 I892

RESPONSIBILITY FOR TORTS OF HIS INFANT CHILDThe case of Johnson v Glidden So Dak 76 N E 933 recognizes the elementary principle that a father merely as parent is not responsible for torts committed by his in fant child a principle embodied in the statute of South Dakota but if the father furnishes his young son with a gun and knows that he is accustomed to handle it in a reckless manner and permits him to shout use abusive language and discharge firearms at persons who are passing along the highway in front of his house he thereby permits that to be done on his premises which in its nature is likely to result in damage to those passing and when an injury does happen 1898 543 NOTES OF CASES

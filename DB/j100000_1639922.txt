University College London Univer sity to which Dr Marie Stopes has been ap pointed DISCUSSION AND CORRESPONDENCE A SECOND CAPTURE OF THE WHALE SHARK RHINEODON TYPUS IN FLORIDA WATERS IN SCIENCE for February 28 1902 and again in Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collec tions Vol 48 1905 Mr B A Bean of the United States National Museum has recorded the coming ashore on the beach three miles north of Ormond Florida of an 18foot speci men of the whale shark Rhineodon typus the skin and some parts of which are preserved in the National Museum Mr Bean in the above papers and Dr Gill in SCIENCE for May 23 1902 and May 19 1905 have thoroughly and interestingly sum marized almost all the scanty literature of this very large and very rare fish The pur pose of this note is to record the capture in Florida waters of another and much larger specimen than the one of which Mr Bean has made note On June 1 1912 Captain Charles Thomp son of Miami Florida captured near Knights Key Florida East Coast Railway Extension what is probably the largest specimen of the whale shark ever taken by man This mon ster is reported to have been 45 feet long and 23 feet in circumference and its weight is estimated at from 15000 to 30000 pounds While in Miami last summer I talked with Captain Thompson and saw the as yet un mounted skin To one who has never seen a whale the skin of this shark is inconceivably large During the winter Captain Thompson has had the skin mounted and photographs of it show that the work has been well done Through his courtesy I have not only these photographs but also one of the fish taken shortly after its capture During the winter I have been collecting data on Rhineodon and during the coming summer I expect to be in Miami at which N S VOL XXXVIII No 973 time I purpose with Captain Thompsons per mission to describe and to make careful meas urements and to get from him full data con cerning the capture of this great fish This will be embodied in another and more ex tensive paper to be published later in which will be included certain historical data not given in either Dr Gills or Mr Beans papers above referred to In the meantime it seems well to call attention to this the second occurrence of the whale shark in the waters of the east coast of the United States As to the name of this fish Rhineodon typus the following statement may be made The whale shark was first described from Table Bay Cape of Good Hope South Africa by Dr Andrew Smith in April 1828 His description and figure were published in the Zoological Journal for 1829 under the name Rhincodon typus However this is clearly a typographical error since the derivation is rhine file  odous odont tooth Muller and Henle 1838 first used the name given at the head of this paragraph but later 1841 wrote it as it is commonly put Rhinodon typicus Dr Gill however 1905 goes back to the former spelling E W GUDGER STATE NORtMAL COLLEGE GREENSBORO N C cc CARBATES  To THE EDITOR OF SCIENCE In this age of method accuracy and conciseness we say sulphates instead of sulphurates phosphates for phosphorates better still sulfates and fos fates nitrates for nitrogenates chlorates for chlorinates Why should we not say car bates instead of carbonates We already say carbides instead of carbon ides why should we not follow the fashion consistently and say carbates We should then have the word carbation to mean the formation of carbates leaving the word carbonation to refer to the development of carbon in a substance which would fittingly correspond to the present word carbonize and so avoid a puzzling ambiguityAUGUST 22 1913 Furthermore the saving of time and print ers ink would amount to something in a word so often used J E TODD UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS FROST IN CALIFORNIA To THE EDITOR OF SCIENCE In a recent issue of SCIENCE mention was made of the effect of a recent freeze upon the vegetation of south ern California resulting in the destruction of many introduced varieties including some very large trees The writer has been considerably interested in observing the effect of the freeze in this section especially upon the different varieties of trees Immediately following the freeze it did appear that many of the trees were prob ably killed Peppers eucalyptus acacias and grevilleas among the larger trees suffered severely Trees two to three feet in diameter and from twentyfive to thirty years old in some cases had the bark split clear to the wood almost from top to bottom of the tree The bark turned black clear to the wood and great masses of it could be split off easily Supposing that trees in such condition were certainly dead scores of them were cut down at once Wiser counsel was to delay opera tions until opportunity was given to see what the outcome might be One can scarcely conceive what such a loss means to a community such as this where shade means so much and where such magnifi cent results have been obtained Some of our streets were lined with rows of eucalyptus from 75 to 150 feet high Many of these have been cut down Subsequent results show that delay in cutting and pruning was the wiser course in this instance for incredible as it may seem many of the trees which had their bark split and turned black and loosened from the wood seem to have begun to develop a new bark or in many cases the old bark seems to be reuniting with the wood and leaves and branches are being put forth I do not believe a single pepper of any size perished In fact it seems to the writer that in their new coat of green they look brighter and fresher than ever Some of the acacias and grevilleas were probably killed but I visited an acacia just recently which two weeks ago one would cer tainly have pronounced dead The bark was split and loosened from the trunk and dry as tinder the limbs were bare and brittle and dry enough to burn but to my surprise when last I saw it here and there along the trunk the bark seemed to be reforming and green shoots a foot or more in length had grown It looks as if with judicious pruning and care the tree might be made to live though prob ably hideously deformed Perhaps the most surprising results are to be observed among the eucalyptus trees Some varieties have suffered severely The sugar gum E cornocalyx lemon gum E citri odota E robusta and E callyophylla suffered considerably The blue gum E globulus was injured in some localities E amygdalina was not injured at all The surprising feature in every case is the formation of a new bark or the rejuvenation of the old Trees on which the bark was split and black and loosened from the wood now have bark green and full of sap and firmly united to the wood The branches are for the most part dead except the very large ones and stand out bare and brown The trunk and larger branches are covered almost from top to bottom with a new extremely dense growth of adventitious branches thickly covered with leaves giving the tree a peculiar fuzzy ap pearance Judging from the recovery of trees which two months ago were apparently lifeless I believe it is safe to say that very few trees which were more than two or three years old and in a fairly healthy condition when the freeze came need have been cut Judicious pruning will later be necessary S A SKINNER REDLANDS HIGH SCHOOL REDLANDS CAL SCIENTIFIC BOOKS

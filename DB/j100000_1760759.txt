shelter while they are engaged upon their professional duties AT A MEETING of the Brookville society of natural history Sept 22 a committee was appointed to confer with the scientific associations educational institutions and with individuals throughout the state of Indiana concerning the advisability of the formation of a state academy of science and if thought advisable to cooperate with such persons in favor of the formation of such an association Free expression of opinion is called for by the committee both as to the need of such an organ ization and as to the best plan for its composition It is now the plan to hold a meeting at Indian apolis between Christmas and New Years day It proposed that the organization shall enable the citi zens of Indiana who are engaged in scientific work to meet at certain times  for social intercourse for the exchange of ideas and the comparison of results of scientific studies It would appear from the prospectus that the academy would be a state society similar to the American association WE ARE INFORMED by Prof Chas A Bacon director of the Beloit college observatory that the statement made in Science for Sept 4 that the observatory had been closed on account of lack of funds is incorrect Professor Bacon states that on the contrary new arrangements have been made for carrying on additional observations in meteorology and that especial attention will be paid to solar and spectroscopic work with greater facilities than before IN THE American meteorological journal for Sep tember Dr Daniel Draper director of the Central park meteorological observatory asks the ques tions What is ozone and Can ozone produce pneumonia and he gives for the months of January February March April and May for each year from 1878 to 1885 the death rate from pneumonia for New York City and the figures expressing the amount of ozone anq the number of days on which it was present in the atmos phere as shown by the continuous records of his observatory The coincidence of the curves indi VOL VI No 140 cated by the sets of figuresthough possibly only accidentalyet seems sufficient to warrant further investigation of the matter and would seem to call upon chemists to join now with physicists who are making a special study of atmospheric electricityto see if they can further clear up the doubtful relations between oxygen ozone and electricity and perhaps discover a simpler and more reliable method than the present by which ozone tests or observations can be regularly made by meteorological observers THE PRESIDENT A2D PROFESSOR AGASSIZ When it became known a few days ago that the President had invited Professor Agassiz to assume the direction of the coast survey there was great satisfaction among those who desire that the principles of good government should be applied to the scientific bureaus as well as to the other ex ecutive offices The indapendent position of Pro fessor Agassiz his administrative ability and his acquaintance with the state of science in this country are so obvious that even those who be lieve as we do that a person trained in mathe matical and physical science should be the head of the survey must have seen that in the emergency Agassiz was a very felicitous choice The an nouncement that he had been selected by the President for this responsible station was an assur ance that the administration desired a man of unsullied name and of unquestioned ability to guide the affairs of the coast survey in the em barrassments which they have encountered It removed the apprehensions which have been enter tained that scientific work will not be encouraged by the party in power It showed that the Presi dent and the Secretary of the treasury in the difficulty which has arisen are not indifferent to the survey but are sincerely desirous of placing it under the direction of an able man whose name and character would be the guarantee of success The health of Professor Agassiz precludes his acceptance but he has another reason for refusing the office in question In his opinion the guidance of the coast survey requires an expert The prob lems to be decided the methods to be employed the men to be engaged should be determined by one who knows the business Any other person would be in danger of failure The culture of Agassiz is so broad and his experience has beenOCTOBER 9 1885 SCIE1 so varied that he would have been an admirable man for the emergency and even as a permanent head would have shown many admirable qualities Nevertheless he is doubtless right in saying that four men can be named two already in the gov ernment service and two not so employed who are qualified for the post by their acquaintance with the precise investigations which are prosecuted by the survey One of these he hopes will be appointed From all that reaches us we are persuaded that neither the President nor his advisers are hostile to the proper prosecution of the government work in science If abuses have crept into any depart ment these abuses will doubtless be eradicated As the corrections proceed undue zeal may some times be shown by the subordinate reformers in dividuals may neglect the considerations of courtesy and the deference due to those whose lives have been devoted without reproach to the service of the country but the correspondence of Secretary Manning and Professor Agassiz is to us an assur ance that science will not be retarded and that scientific men will not be slighted by any act of President Cleveland BULGARIA AND BULGARIANS Fortythree years have come and gone since M Cyprien Robert wrote that On the confines of Europe there vegetates enslaved and forlorn a nation hardly known at the present day but de serving all our sympathy This nation is that of the Bulgarians which has preserved in the hardest state of slavery its ancient manners its lively faith its noble character and after having had a glorious past seems destined by its geo graphical position to play an important part in the future Few political prophets have been happier in their prophecies Since 1842 the Bul garians having acquired a national church and some educational facilities have thrown off the cloak of listless barbarism which then enveloped them have risen against the Turks their masters have been secured by the strong arm of Russia with the consent of Europe in a position of con ditional independence and now at last united and aroused seem destined to free themselves entirely from the Turkish yoke and in time per haps to become the European successor of that multitudinous crime which we call the Ottoman government One must not ascribe everything to mere geo graphical position National peculiarities have had NCE 303 much to do with this progress but a glance at the accompanying map will serve to show not merely the commercial importance of the country inhabited by the Bulgarians but also that in a purely strategic point of view the Bulgarians hold the key to Constantinople They may be said to inhabit an immense square bounded on the north by the Danube from Widin to Silistria and thence in a direct line to the Black Sea near Varna on the east by the Black Sea itself on the south by the peninsula upon which Constan tinople stands and the AEgean and on the west by Albania and Servia The northeastern portion of this region however has been colonized by the Tartars who flying from Russian rule soon after the close of the Crimean war settled on the grassy plain lying to the north of the Roman wall and between the Danube and the Black Sea This plain known as the Dobrudsha soon proved too small for them and they spread thence to the south and west for a considerable distance Neither in strictness can the Bulgarians be said to live on the coast either of the Black or AEgean seas as in all the towns on the sea coast the Greek holds the most important position The Balkans divide this Bulgarian square into two unequal parallelograms the northern of which constitutes the Bulgaria of the Berlin congress while the southern forms the larger part of the Eastern Rumelia of the same instrument Thus it will be seen that the Bul garian holds the line of the Danube the outermost defence of Constantinople that the Balkans with their difficult passes are entirely within his control that Shumla which has so often and so promi nently figured in the Russian advances is now a Bulgarian fortress and that Adrianople the railroad centre of the Constantinople peninsula lies on his borders Besides this Salonika the military port of the IEgean and Varna that of the Black Sea are almost at the mercy of an army having possession of the roads and the sympathies of the people of this region even though the ma jority of the inhabitants of the towns themselves are inimical to the Bulgarians The Bulgarians of today resemble the other Slavic races of Europe more closely than they do the Turks or the Greeks Yet unlike the Servians and Montenegrins they are not of pure Slavic descent but are a Slavonianized race Men learned in the languages profess to find in the Bulgarian dialect certain words and phrases which point to a Finnish origin but there is an element too derived from Turkish and Persian languages while some scholars relying more on ethnological sinmilarities than on philological analogies declare the Bulgarian to be of Mongol extraction What ever theory is the true one the Bulgarian differs

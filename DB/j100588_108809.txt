J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,108809,ON THE CALCULUS OF SYMBOLS THIRD MEMOIR,I207018, 517  XXIV ON THE CALCULUS OF SYMBOLSTHIRD MEMOIR BY W E L RUSSELL ESQ AB COMMUNICATED BY A CAYLEJY FRS RECEIVED MAY 15READ MAY 21 1863 IN MY SECOND MEMOIR  ON THE CALCULUS OF SYMBOLS I WORKED OUT THE GENERAL CASE OF MULTIPLICATION ACCORDING TO ONE OF THE TWO SYSTEMS OF COMBINATION OF NONCOMMUTATIVE SYMBOLS PREVIOUSLY GIVEN IN THE PRESENT PAPER I PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE THE GENERAL CASE OF MULTIPLICATION ACCORDING TO THE OTHER SYSTEM I COMMENCE WITH THE BINOMIAL THEOREM TO WHICH THE SECOND SYSTEM GIVES RISE IN MY PREVIOUS RESEARCHES I OBTAINED THE GENERAL TERM OF THE BINOMIAL THEOREM WHEN THE SYMBOLS COMBINE ACCORDING TO THE FIRST SYSTEM BY EQUATING SYMBOLICAL COEFFICIENTS HERE ON THE OTHER HAND I CONSIDER THE NATURE OF THE COMBINATIONS WHICH ARISE FROM THE SYMBOLICAL MULTIPLICATION AND OBTAIN THE GENERAL TERM BY SUMMATION I NEXT PROCEED TO THE MULTIPLICATION OF BINOMIAL FACTORS HERE THE GENERAL TERM IS OBTAINED BY CONSIDERING THE ALTERATION OF WEIGHT UNDERGONE BY CERTAIN SYMBOLS IN THE PROCESS OF MULTIPLICATION THE MULTINOMIAL THEO REM ACCORDING TO THE SECOND SYSTEM IS NEXT CONSIDERED AND ITS GENERAL TERM CALCULATED I CONCLUDE THE MEMOIR WITH SOME APPLICATIONS OF THE CALCULUS OF SYMBOLS TO SUCCESSIVE DIFFERENTIATION THIS PAPER COMPLETES THE INVESTIGATION OF SYMBOLICAL MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION ACCORDING TO THE TWO SYSTEMS OF COMBINATION THE GENERAL CASE OF DIVISION HAVING BEEN WORKED OUT BY MR SPOTTISWOODE IN A VERY

Kootenay British Columbia the writer was but too often made aware of the presence of owls by their loud and expulsive hoots After listening for some time one evening to the sonorous tuwhtttuwhittuwhu of these nocturnal minstres it suddenly occurred to him to ask his Kootenay Indian com panion what the owls were saying He responded without hesitation that the owl spoke two things a ksetlkenetl patlke b katskakitl patlke The meaning of these phrases the writer is not able to explain as yet but patke  woman The owls note did not seem to vary any although the Indian declared the owl said the two different things By and by the writer without being conscious of any particular eXort on his part ceased to hear the tuwhittuwhittuzohu so familiar to him and the sounds that reached his ears were ksetlkenetl pAtlke kAtskakitl patlke these phrases with the exception of the word pdtlke being before entirely unknown to him and he being ignorant of their real signification Moreover by a very slight effort he was abe to in terchange these sounds and to hear at will the common English or the Kootenay Indian rendering of the owls cry The writer took particular cognizance of the fact at the time and when returning by the C P R made the experiment of repeatiag words and stanzas of verse with dif ferent stress and accentuation to the series of noises made by the wheel3 of the cars as they reached the end of each rail He found that be the measure of the verses what it might the correspondence between it and the click of the rails could still be maintained Mr Cameron of Toronto Uaiversity informed the writer when dis cussing the matter that he had noticed that similar effects were pro duced by experimenting in a like manner with the ticking of a clock or any noise of that kind The possibility of shifting from Kootenay to English in the case of the owls cry may be susceptible of explanation in this way partly at least SirDaniel Wilsonl has recorded a similar case it would be es actly the same if the writers Indian had been able to hear the tXwhittu ohiStuwhu Oronyhateka an educated Mohawk Indian in replying to some queries addressed to him relative to his native language thus writes me in reference to the Caprimulgus vociferus or whippoorwill When I listen with my Indian ears it seems to me utterly impossibe to form any other word from an imitation of its notes than kwakoryeuh but when I put on my English ears I hear the bird quite distinctly saying whippoor roill Assickinack an educated Odahwah Indian wrote the same cry heard nightly throughout the summer in the American forestsqthaoo nah and an Englishman recently arrived in Can2lda who llstened to this cry for the first time without being aware of the popular significance attached to it wrote it down at my request eMpooweh It is evident that a psychological study of onomatopoeia would lead to some interesting and valuable results Some nine months ago the writer conducted a short series of experi mentsin this line A series of unmeaning collections of letters pro nounced in the ordinary English fashion were given one by one to the subject and he was requested to state the soundwhich he thought was best represented by the group of letters given him Following is the result in three cases t Prehistoric Man 3rd ed 1876 II 365 6 PSYCEOLOGICAL LITERATURE SOUNDS T110UGEXT OF BY SUBJSCTS

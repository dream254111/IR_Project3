J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107351,OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS ON VISION,I206966,E 378 A XIX OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS ON VISION PBY WILLIAM CHARLES WELLS M D F R S READ JULY 4TH I18 I I I WAS CONSULTED INE BINE EGINING OF THE YEAR ISG9 UPON A DISEASE OF VISION WHICH AS FAR AS I KNOW HAS NOT HITHERTO BEEN MENTIONED BY ANY AUTHOR THE SUBJECT OF IT WAS A GEN TLEMAN ABOUT THIRTYFIVE YEARS OLD VERY TALL AND INCLIINGI TO BE CORPULENT ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE I SAW HIM HE HAD BEEN ATTACKED WITH A CATARRH AND AS THIS WAS LEAVING HIM HE WAS SEIZED WITH A SLIGHT STUPOR AND A FEELING OF WEIGHT IN HIS FORE HEAD HE BEGAN AT THE SAME TIME TO SEE LESS DISTINCTLY THAN FORMERLY WITH HIS RIGHT EYE AND TO LOSE THE POWE R OF MOVING ITS UPPER LID THE PUPIL OF THE SAME EYE WAS NOW ALSO OB SERVED TO BE MUCH DILATED IN A FEW DAYS THE LEFT EYE BECAME SIMILARLY AIFECTED WITH THE RIGHT BUT IN A LESS DEGREE SUCH WAS THE ACCOUNT OF THE CASE WHICH I RECEIVED FROM THE PATIENT HIMSELF AND FROM THE SURGEON WHO ATTENDED HIM THE FOR MER ADDED THAT PREVIOUSLY TO HIS PRESENT AILMENT HIS SIGHT HAD ALWAYS BEEN SO GOOD THAT HE HAD NEVER USED GLASSES OFT ANY KIND TO IMPROVE IT ON EXAMINING HIS EYES MYSELF I COULD NOT DISCOVER IN THEM ANY OTHER APPEARANCE OF DISEASE THAN THAT THEIR PUPILS THE RIGHT PARTICULARLY WERE MUCH TOO LARGE AND THAT THEIR SIZE WAS LITTLE AFFECTED BY THE QUANTITY OF LIGHT WHICH PASSED THROUGH THEM AT FIRST I THOUGHT THAT THEIR DILATATION WAS OCCASIONED BY A DEFECT OF SENSIBILITY IN THE1O2 IFTUDZIA SECTIOVI F CAEAALIET 6T 0 9 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1O S

C 879 RETINAS BUT I WAS QUICKLY OBLIGED TO ABANDON THIS OPINION AS THE PATIENT ASSURED ME THAT HIS SENSATION OF LIGLT WAS AS STRONG AS IT HAD EVER BEEN DURING ANY FORMER PERIOD OF HIS LIFE I NEXT INQUIRED WHETHER OBJECTS AT DIFFERENT DISTANCES APPEARED TO HIM EQUALLY DISTINCT HE ANSWERED THAT HE SAW DISTANT OBJECTS ACCURATELY AND IN PROOF TOLD ME WHAT THE HOUR WAS BY A REMOTE PUBLIC CLOCK BUT HE ADDED TLAT THE LETTERS OF A BOOK SEEMED TO HIM SO CONFUSED THAT IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY HE COULD MAKE OUT THE WORDS WHICH THEY COMPOSED LHE WAS NOW DESIRED TO LOOK AT A PAGE OF A PRINTED BOOK THROUGH SPEC TACLES WITH CONVEX GLASSES HE DID SO AND FOUND THAT HE COULD READ IT WITH EASE FROM THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IT WAS VERY PLAIN THAT THIS GENTLEMAN AT THE SAME TIME THAT HIS PUPILS HAD BECOME DILATED AND HIS UPPER EYELIDS PARALYTIC HAD ACQUIRED THE SIGHT OF AN OLD MAN BY LOSITNG SUDDENLY THE COMMAND OF THE MUSCLES BY WHICH THE EYE IS ENABLED TO SEE NEAR OBJECTS DISTINCTLY IT BEING KNOWN TO THOSE WHO ARE COHVERSANT WITH THE FACTS RELATING TO HUMAN VISION THAT THE EYE IN ITS RELAXED STATE IS FITTED FOR DISTANT OBJECTS AND THAT THE SEEING OF NEAR OBJECTS ACCURATELY IS DEPENDANT UPON MUSCULAR EXERTION THE DISEASE OF WHICH I HAVE SPOKEN IS PERHAPS NOT EX TREMELY RARE FOR HAVING RELATED THE PRECEDING INSTANCE OF IT TO MR WARE A FELLOW OF THIS SOCIETY HE WAS KIND ENOUGH SHORTLY AFTER TO SEND TO ME A YOUNG WOMAN WHO APPEARED TO BE LIKEWISE AFFECTED WITH IT EUT AS I SAWV HER ONLY ONCE AND HAD NOT THEN SUFFICIENT TIME TO EXAMINE HER CASE MINUTELY I SPEAK WITH DIFFIDENCE CONCERNING ITS NATURE II AFTER I HAD REFLECTED FREQUENTLY UPON THESE CASES IT OC CURRED TO ME THAT AS THE JUICE OF THE HERB BLLADONNA WHEN APPLIED TO THE EYE OCCASIONS THE PUPIL TO DILATE CONSIDERABLY 3C2 DR WELLSS OBSERVATIONS AND TO BECOME UNALTERABLE BY LIGHT AN EFFECT MIGHT T AT TE SAME TIME BE PRODUCED BY IT UPON VISION SIMILAR TO THAT WHIHL I HAVE JUST DESCRIBED I HAD INDEED IN THE COURSE OF A FEW YEARS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING APPLIED BELLADONNA SEVERAL TIMES TO MY OWN EYES WITHOUT OBSERVING ANY CHANGE ILN MY SIGHT BEYOND WHAT I REFERRED TO THE INCREASED SIZE OF THE PUPILS BUT AS I HAD NOT LOOKED FOR ANY OTHER I THOUGLHT IT POSSIBLE THAT SOME ADDITIONAL ONE MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT MY HAVING PERCEIVED IT I RESOLVED THEREFORE TO MAKE THE EXPE RIMENT ANEW BUT TO CONDUCT IT WITH PRECISION IT WAS PREVI OUSLY NECESSARY TO KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT I POSSESSED THE FACULTY OF ADAPTING MY EYES TO DIFTERENT DISTANCES ON THIS SUBJECT I HAD MADE MANY EXPERIMENTS WITH GREAT CARE NEARLY TWENTY YEARS BEFORE AND HAD ASCERTAINED THAT WITL RNY LEFT EYE WHICH WAS MORE PERFECT THAN THE RIGHT I COULD BRING TO SINGLE POINTS ON THE RETINA PERCILS OF RAYS WHICEH FLOWED FROM EVERY DISTANCE GREATER THAN THAT OF SEVENI INCHES FROM THE CORNEA IN THE MEAN TIME HOWEVER MY EYES HAD ALTERED CONSIDERABLY WITH RESPECT TO THEIR SEEING NEAR OBJECTS DIS TINCTLY AND I HAD IN CONSEQUENCE BEEN OBLIGED NOT ONLY TO USE CONVEX GLASSES BUT TO CHANGE THEM SEVERAL TIMES FOR UOTHERS OF HIGHER POWER NO DEPENDANCE THEREFORE BEING NOW TO BE PLACED IN MY FORMER EXPERIMENTS IN REGARD TO THE PRE SENT STATE OF MY SIGHT I REPEATED THEM AND FOUND TO MY GREAT SURPRISE THAT THE POWER I ONCE POSSESSED OF ADAPTING MY EYES TO DIFFERENT DISTANCES WAS ENTIRELY GONE IN OTHER WORDS THAT I WAS NOW OBLIGED TO REGARD ALL OBJECTS WHETHER NEAR OR REMOTE IN THE SAME REFRACTIVE STATE OF THOSE ORGANSO I FOUND ALSO THAT MY EYES CONSIDERED AS MERE OPTICAL INSTRU  ESSAY ON SIIGLE VISION WITH TWO EYES C P 137 880OAND EXPENMENTS ON ZISION 38 MENTS WERE NEARLY THE SAME AS THEY HAD BEEN IN MY YOUTH AND THAT THE CONVEX GLASSES WHICH I USED DID VEY LITTLE MORE THAN SUPPLY WITH RESPECT TO NEAR OBJECTS THE PLACE OF A LIVING OPOWER WHICH I HAD LOST WITHOUT COMPENSATING EXCEPT IN A VERY SMALL DEGREE FOR ANY ALTERATION IN THE EXTERNAL SHAPE OF THE EYE OR ANY CHANGE IN THE COZIFIGURATION OF ITS INTERIOR PARTS I ASCERTAINED FOR INSTANCE THAT TO GIVE MY LEFT EYE THE REFRACTIVE POWER WHICH IT FORMERLY POSSESSED WILE IN IS MOST RELAXED STATE THAT BY WHICH IT WAS ENABLED TO BRING A PENCIL OF PARALLEL RAYS TO A POINT ON THIE RETINA A GLASS OF THIRTYSIX INCHLES FOCUS WAS FILLY SUFFICIENT WHEREAS TO PRODUCE AN EQUAL EFFECT UPON RAYS PROCEEDING FROM A POINT AT THE DISTANCE OF SEVEN INCHES FROM MY EYE THE OTHER EXTREMITY OF MY ANCIENT RANGE OF PERFECT VISION I WAS NOW OBLIGED TO EMPLOY A GLASS HAVING A FOCUS OF ONLY SIX INCHES I REGRET MUCH THAT I HAD NOT MADE SUCHI EXPERIMENTS FREQUENTLY BEFORE AS I THINK IT VERY PROBABLE THAT I SHOULD HAVE FOUND A P3ERIOD IN THE PRO GRESS OF MNY VISON TO ITS PRESENT STATE IN WHICLH MY CAPACITY OF SEEING DISTANT JECTS WAS THE SAME AS IN MY YOUTH AN WHEN THEREFORE THE WHOLE OF MY IMPERFECT VISION OF NEAR OB JECTS WOULD HAVE BEEN OWING TO A LOSS OF THE MUSCULAR POWERS OF MY EYE AS THERE CAN BE NO GOOD REASON FOR SUPPOSING THAT THE CHANGES WHICH HAVE OCCURRED IN MY EYES AR DIFERENT FROM THOSE WHICH THE EYES OF BY FAR THE GREATER NUMBER OF PER SONS WHO ARE NOT SHORTSIGHTED UNDERGO AT THE APPROACH OF OLD AGE IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE EXPERIMENTS OF DR YOUNG ON THE EYE OF HIANSON WHOM THE LEARNED AUTHOR CONSIDERED AS A VERY FAIR SUBJECT FOR SUCH TRIALS FURNISH NO PROOF THAT THE PHL  TRANIS X8OX P 6638X DR WELLSS OBSERVATIONS WANT OF THE CRYSTALLINE LENS DISABLES A PERSON FROM HAVING PERFECT VISION AT DIFFERENT DISTANCES FOR AS HANSON WAS SIXTY THREE YEARS OLD IT IS HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT THE RESULTS OF THE EXPERIMENTS WOULD HAVE BEEN EXACTLY THE SAME IF HE HAD STILL POSSESSED THAT PART OF HIS EYE III IHAVING DISCOVERED THAT MY OWN EYES WERE UNFIT FOR THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH I WISHED TO BE MADE WITH BELLADONNA I INSTRUCTED AN INGENIOUS YOUNG PHYSICIAN DR CUTTING FROM THE ISLAND OF BARBADOES AND NOW RESIDING THERE IN THE MAN NER ELSEWHERE DESCRIBED BY ME OF ASCERTAINING HIS RANGE OF PERFECT VISION BY MEANS OF LUMINOUS POINTS THIS HE FOUND IN CONSEQUENCE TO BEGIN WITH RESPECT TO HIS LEFT EYE AT THE DISTANCE OF SIX INCHES AND NOT TO TERMINATE AT THE DISTANCE OF EIGHT FEET BEYOND WHICH HE COULD NOT SEE CLEARLY THE OBJECT WITH WHICH HE HAD HITHERTO MADE HIS EXPERIMENTS THE IMAGE OF THE FLAME OF A CANDLE IN THE BULB OF A SMALL THERMOMETER THE FLAME OF A LAMP DISTANT ABOUT SIXTY YARDS GAVE A FAINT INDICATION OF ITS RAYS MEETING BEFORE THEY FELL UPON THE RETINA THE RAYS FROM A STAR HAD VERY EVIDENTLY THEIR FOCUS A LITTLE BEFORE THAT MEMBRANE LE NOW APPLIED THE JUICE OF BELLA DONNA TO HIS LEFT EYE HALF AN HOUR AFTER WHEN HIS PUPIL WAS BUT LITTLE DILATED PERFECT VISION COMMENCED AT THE DISTANCE OF SEVEN INCHES IN FIFTEEN MINUTES MORE IT BEGAN AT THE DISTANCE OF THREE FEET AND A HALF WHEN HIS PUPIL HAD ACQUIRED ITS GREATEST ENLARGEMENT THE RAYS FROM THE IMAGE OF THE FLAME OF A CANDLE IN THE BULB OF A SMALL THERMOMETER AT THE DISTANCE OF EIGHT FEET COULD NOT BE PREVENTED FROM CONVERGING TO A POINT BEHIND THE RETINA THE RAYS FROM LAMPS STILL MORE DIS TANT AND FROM STARS HAD THEIR FOCUSES AT THE SAME TIME ON ESSAY ON SINGLE VISION C P X I6AND EXPERINENTS OT VIS ION 3 THE RETINA THIS STATE OF VISION CONTINUED IN ITS GREATEST EXTENT TO THE FOLLOWING DAY AND IT WAS NOT TILL THE NINTHL DAY AFTER THE APPLICATION OF THE BELLADONNA THAT HE COMPLETELY RE COVERED THE POWER OF ADAPTING HIS EYE TO NEAR OBJECTS WHILE HIS LEFT EYE WAS THUS AFF CTED THE VISION OF THE RIGHT REMAINED UNALTERED DR CUTTING REMARKEDAWHIE HIS LEFT EYE WAS RETURNING TO ITS NATURAL CONDITION TRAT THE DIMINUTION OF THE PUPIL AND THE INCREASE OF THE RANGE OF PERFECT VISION DID NOT KEEP REGULAR PACE WITH EACH OTHER BUT THAT AFTER HIS PUPIL HAD NEARLY RE TURNED TO ITS FORMNER SIZE HIS CAPACITY OF ADAPTING THE EYE TO DIERENT DISTANCES WAS STILL VERY LINIITED AS THESE EFFECTS THEREFORE ARE NOT INSEPARABLY CONNECTED THEY MAY OCCUR IN OTHERS IN A DIFFERENT MANNER FROM THAT WHICH HE OBSERVED A GREAT DEGREE OF DILATATION FOR EXAMPLE IMAY TAKE PLACE IN TLHE PUPIL WITHOUT A TOTAL WANT OF THE POWER TO ADAPT TIHE EYE TO DIFFERENT DISTANCES THOUGH I COULD NOT DOUBT THE ACCURACY OF DR CUTTINGS OBSERVATIONS MORE ESPECIALLY AS THE ALTERED STATE OF HIS EYE HAD LASTED A CONSIIDERABLE TIME AND AS HE HAD NOT BEENPRE VENTED BY OTHER OCCUPATIONS FROM1 ATTENDINHG MINUTELY TO THE APPEARANCES WHICH WERE CONSEQUENT UPON IT YET AS LIE WAS THE FIRST PERSON WHO HAD EVER APJPIED 3BEILADONNA TO HIS EYE FOR THE PURPOSE W HICH HAS BEEN METIONED AND AS THE RESULTS HAD BEEN REMARKABLE I REQUESTED LHI TO REPEAT THE EXPERI MENT WITH HIS OTHER EYE HE COMPLIED WITH MY DESIRE AND FOUND THAT THE APPEARANCES WHICH FULLOWCD WERE SIRLIAR TO THOSE WHICH HAD BEEN PRODUCED BY THE APPLICATION OF BELIA DONNA TO HIS LEFT EYE IT WILL PERLAPS BE THOUGHT EXTRAORDINARY THAT DRDR WELLSS OBSERVATIONS CUTTINGS EYE IN ITS RELAXED STATE BEFORE THE APPLICATION OF THE BELLADONNA BROUGHT PARALLEL RAYS TO A FOCUS ANTERIOR TO THE RETINA BUT THAT SIMILAR RAYS MET IN A POINT UPON THE RE TINA WHILE THE EYE WAS UNDER THE FULL INFLUENCE OF THAT SUB STANCE AS IT MAY HENCE SEEM THAT THE BELLADONNA HAD DONE MORE THAN RMERELY SUSPEND THE EXERCISE OF THE POWER BY WHICH THE EYE IS FITTED TO SEE NEAR OBJECTS DISTINCTLY AN OB SERVATION DRAWN FROM THE FORMER STATE OF MY OWN SIGHT WILL I EXPECT MAKE THIS MATTER PLAIN WHET I ENJOYED THE FACULTY OF ADAPTING MY EYES TO OBJECTS AT DIFFERENT DISTANCES THE RAYS OF A STAR WHICH WAS VIEWED ATTENTIVELY BY ME ALWAYS MET IN A POINT A LITTLE BEFORE THE RETINA  WHENCE I AT FIRST CONCLUDED THAT MY EYE WAS UNFIT FOR ACCURATE VISION BY PARALLEL RAYS BUT I AFTERWARDS FOUND THAT IF I LOOKED AT A STAR CARELESSLY ITS RAYS HAD THEN THEIR CONCOURSE ON THE RETINA IN THE FORMER CASE FROM LONG HABIT ORIGINATING IN MY HAVING CHLIEFLY VIEWED NEAR OBJECTS WITH AT TENTION SOME SNALL EXERTION AS MADE FOR THE ACCURATE VIEW OF A DISTANT OBJECT THOUGH NONE WAS REQUISITE IN THE LATTER ALL DEMAND FOR EXERTION CEASING MY EYE FELL INTO THE MOST RELAXED CONDITION THAT BY WHICH IT WAS FITTED FOR PARALLEL RAYS DR CUTTING  EYE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN SIMILAR TO WHAT MY OWN ONCE WAS IN REGARD TO SUCH RAYS BUT AS HE HAD NOT AC QUIRED THE FACULTY OF VIEWING A DISTANT OBJECT WITHOUT MAKING SOME EXERTION THE RAYS FROM A STAR CROSSED ONE ANOTHER IN HIS EYE BEFORE THEY CAME TOTHE RETINA THE CAPACITY HOWEVER OF MAKING ANY EXERTION WAS TAKENA AWAY BY THE BELLADONNA AND PENCILS OF PARALLEL RAYSWERE IN CONSEQUENCE BROUGHT TO POINTS UPON THAT MEMBRANE ESSAY ON SINIGLE VISION C P 138 3884AND EXPERIMENTS ON VISION IV BEING NOW IN POSSESSION OF A NEW INSTRUMENT I NEXT ATTEMPTED TO GAIN BY MEANS OF IT SOME ILLUSTRATION OF THE CHANGES WHICH THE VSION OF SHORTSIGHTED PERSONS UNDERGOES FROM AGE IT HAS BEEN VERY GENERALLY IF NOT UNIVERSALLY ASSERTED BY SYSTEMATIC WRITERS UPON VISION THAT THE SHORTSIGHTED ARE REN DERED BY AGE FITTER FOR SEEING DISTANT OBJECTS THLAN THEY WERE IN THEIR YOUTH BUT THIS OPINION APPEARS TO ME UNFOUNDED IN FACT ANDL TO REST ALTOGETHER UPON A FALSE ANALOGY IF THOSE WHO POSSESS ORDINARY VISION WHEN YOUNG BECOME FROM THE FLATNESS OF THE CORNEA OR OTHER CHANGES IN THE MERE STRUCTURE OF THE EYE LONGSIGHTED AS THEY APPROACH TO OLD AGE IT FOL LOWS THAT THE SHORTSIGHTED MUST FROM SIMILAR CHANGES BE COME BETTER FITTED TO SEE DISTANT OBJECTS SUCH APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN THEIR REASONING BUT THE COURSE PURSUED BY NATURE SEEMS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH THEY HAVE ASSIGNED TO HER FOR OF FOUR SHORTSIGHLTED PERSONS OF MY ACQUAINTANCE THE AGES OF WHOM ARE BETWEEN FIFTYFOUR AND SIXTY YEARS AND INTO THE STATE OF WHOSE VISION I HAVE INQUIRED PARTICULARLY TWO HAVE NOT OBSERVED THAT THEIR VISION HAS CHANGED SINCE THEY WERE YOUNG AND TWO HAVE LATELY BECOME IN RESPECT TO DIS TANT OBJECTS MORE SHORTSIGHTED T TH THEY WERE FORMERLY ASS HE MANNER IN WHICH THIS CHATGE HAS OCCURRED IS UNNOTICED I BELIEVE BY ANY PRECEDING AUTHOR I SHALL HERE RELATE THE MORE REMARKABLE OF THE TWO CASES A GENTLEMAN WHO IS A FELLOW OF THIS SOCIETY BECAME SHORT SIGHTED IN EARLY LIFE AND AS HIS PROFESSION OBLIIGED HINM TO AT TEND VERY MUCH TO MINIUTE VISIBLE OBJECTS HE FOR NMANY YEARS WORE SPECTACLES WITH CONCAVXE GLASSES ALMOST CONSTANTLY BY THE AID OF VHICH HE SAW AS DISTINCTLY AND AT AS GREA A VARITY MDCCCXI D D A5DR WELLSS OBSERATIONS OF DISTANCES AS THOSE WHO ENJOY THE MOST PERFECT VISION AT THE AGE OF FIFTY HOWEVER HE BEGAN TO OBSERVE THAT DISTANT OBECTS THOUGH VIEWED THROUGH HIS GLASSES APPEARED INDIS TINCT AND HE WAS HETCE LED TO FEAR THAT HIS EYES WERE AFFEITED VITH SOME DISEASE BUT HAPPENING ONE DAY TO TAKE UP IN AN OPTICIANS SHOP A SINGLE CONCAVE GLASS AND TO HOLD IT BEFORE ONE OF HIS EYES WHILE HIS SPECTACLES WERE ON HE FOUND TO HIS GREAT JOY THAT HE HAD REGAIRED DISTINCT VISION OF DISTANT OBJECTS WITH REGARD TO SUCH OBJECTS THEREFORE HE HAD LATELY BECOME SHORTERSIGHTED THAN HE HAD FORMERLY BEEN BUT ALONG WITH THIS CHANGE ANOTHER OCCURRED OF A DIRECTLY OPPOSITE KIND FOR WHEN HE WISHED TO EXAMINE A MINUTE OBJECT ATTENTIVELY SUCH AS HE USED TO SEE ACCURATELY BY MEANS OF HIS SPECTACLES HE NOW FOUND IT NECESSARY TO LAY THEM ASIDE AND TO EMPLOY HIS NAKED EYE HE HAD BECOME THEREFORE IN RESPECT TO NEAR OBJECTS LONGERSIGHTED THE POWER CONSEQUENTLY IN THIS GENTLEMAN TO ADAPT THE EYE TO DILRENT DISTANCES IS EITLLER TOTALLY LOST OR MUCH DIMINISHED BUT THE POINT OR SMALL SPACE TO WHICH HIS PERFECT VISION IS NOW CONFINED INSTEAD OF BEING THE MOST REMOTE TO WHICH HE COULD FORMERLY ACCOMMODATE HIS EYES AS IS COMMONLY THE CASE WITH THE ORDINARILY SIGHTED WHEN THEY ARE BECOMING OLD IS NOW PLACED BETWEEN THE TWO EXTREMES OF HIS FORMER RANGE OF ACCURATE VISION THE EYES OF THE OTHER SHORTSIGHTED PERSON A PHYSICIAN OF CONSIDERABLE LEARNING WHOSE VISION HAS BEEN ALTERED BY AGE HAVE BEEN AFFECTED IN A SIMILAR MANNER BUT NOT IN SO GREAT A DEGREE AS THE ONLY CHANGE WHICH HAD OCCURRED FROM AGE IN THE SIGHT OF SUCH OF MY ACQUAINTANCE AS WERE CONSIDERABLY MYOPIC WAS A LESSENING ON BOTH SIDES OF THEIR RANGE OF PERFECT VISION I CONCEIVED THAT THIS MIGHT BE THE ORDINARY PROCEDURE OF 38GAND EXPERIMENTS ON VISION 387 ATURE IN SUC CASES AND THAT IT MIGHT BE IMITATED IN A YOUNG SHORTSIGHTED PERSON BY THE APPLICATION OF BELLADONNTA TO HIS EYES I LAVE HITHERTO NOT BEEN ABLE TO OBTAIN PERMISSION TO MLAKE THE EXPERIMENT ON ANY YOU NG PERSON WHO IS VERY SHORT SIGHTED TWO GENTLEMEN HOWEVER WHO ARE SONEWHAT SHORT SIGHTED HAVE READILY SUBMNITTED TO IT ONE OF THEMI MR BLUNDTLL A DILIGENT AND INGENIOUS STUDETT OF MEDCINE  THE OTHER MR PATRIK A WELL EDUCATED YOUNG SURGEON IN LON DON THE FIRST EXPERIMRENT WAS ON MR BLUNDELL AND THE APPARENT RESULT WAS THAT THE RANGE OF HIS ACCTURATE VISION WAS 1ONSIDERABLY DIININSHED AT BOTH ENDS BUT NOT ANNIHILATED MR BLUNDELL HOWEVER AFTERWARDS NFRORINED ME THAT LE REPEATED THE EXPERINELNT WITH ORE CARE INT THE COUNTRY AND FOVND THAT IN ONE EYE THE NEAREST POINT OF PERFECT VISION WAS MOVED FOR WARD ABOOUT TVWOTHIRDS OF THE WHOLE RANGE AN3D IN THE OTHER ABOUT ONETHIRD BUT THAT WITH RESPECT TO BOTH EYES THE NOST REMNOTE POINTS OOF THE RANGES WERE UNCHANGED HLE ADDED THAT WHILE ONE EYE WAS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE BELLADONN3A THE OTHER BECAME SHORTERSIGHTED THAN IT HAD BEEN BEFORE BUT THE DIFFERENCE WAS NOT SO GREAT AS TO INDUCE MEI TO PLACE ENTIRE CONFIDENCE IN THE JUSTINESS OF HIS OBSERVATION I TNK IT RIGHT TO MENTION HERE THAT FROM MISTAKE I APPLIED ONLY TWO THIRDS OF THE ORDINARY QUANTITY OF BELLADONNA TO HIS EYE IN THE FRST EXPERIMENT AND THAT HE PROBABLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF MY EXAMNPLE APPLIED NO MORE WHEN H ADE TE N SE CCCND AS ITHIS MIGHT I AVE BEEN THE REASON THAT DURING BOTH EX ERINTIT ETTS AE RETAINED IN PART THE CAPACITY OF ADAPTING HIS EYES TO DIIF RETLT DISTANCES THE EXPERIMENT ON MR PATRICK WAS CONDUCTED BY MYSEIF AFTCER E HHAD BEEN FREQUENTLY EXERCISED IN OBSERVING THE EXTENT  QDDR WELLSS OBSERVATIONS OF HIS PERFECT VISION THE RESULTS WERE SIMILAR TO THOSE WHICH HAD BEEN RERMARKED BY DR CUTTING THE POWER OF ALTERING THE ADAPTATION OF HIS EYE ACCORDING TO THE DISTANCE OF THE OB JECTS VIEWED WAS FOR SOME TIME ENTIRELY LOST AND HIS SIGHT BECAME ACCURATELY FITTED FOR SUCH ONLY AS WERE PLACED AT THE FARTHER EXTREMITY OF HIS FORMER RANGE OF PERFECT VISION WHILE ONE EYE WAS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE BELLADONNA THE VISION OF THE OTHER WAS UNAFFECTED FROM THESE EXPERIMENTS IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT BELLADONNA WILL IN NO CASE PRODUCE THE SAME EFFECT UPON A YOUNG SHORT SIGL TED PERSON THAT AGE HAS PRODUCED IN THE TWO INSTANCES OF WHICH I HAVE SPOKEN I EXPECT HOWEVER TO HAVE AN OPPOR TUNITY OFREPEATING THE EXPERIMENT ON TWO PERSONS WHO ARE VERY CONSIDERABLY SHORTSIGHTED AND I SHALL TAKE THE LIBERTY OF COMMUNNICATING THE RESULT TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY TOGETHER WITH SONE OBSERVATIONS I HAVE ALREADY MADE AND OTHERS WHICH I HOPE TO MAKE RESPECTING THOSE PERSONS WHO SEEM TO RETAIN TO EXTREME OLD AGE THE POWER OF SEEING PERFECTLY AS FAR AS THE ACCOMMODATING POWER OF THE EYE IS CONCERNED BOTH DIS TANT AND NEAR OBJECTS AND OF OTHERS WHO AFTER BEING WITH OUT THIS POWER FOR MANY YEARS APPEAR TO REGAIN IT AT A SIMILAR PERIOD OF LIFE PROBABLY THE MAKING KNOWN MY INTENTION MAY FACILITATE ITS ACCOMPLISHMENT BY INDUCING OTHER FELLOWS OF TLLE SOCIETY TO FURNISH MNE WITHL OPPORTUNITIES OF INCREASING MY KNOWLEDGE OF THESE SUBJECTS IN THE MEAN TIME I SLALL OFFER A FEW WORDS UPON TWO OTHER TOPICS IN VISION WHICH SEEM TO DERIRVE ILLUSTRATION FROM MY EXPERIMENTS WITH BELLADONNA V L NOT ONLY DO THE P UPILS MOVE T OGETHER WHEN BOTH EYES ARE IN A HEALTHY STATE BUT THE PUPIL OF ONE EYE AFICTED WITH GUITTA SERENA IOVES WITH THE PUPIL OF THE OTHER AS LONG AS THIS 88AND EXPERIMENTS ON VISION EMAINS SOUND THESE FACTS ARE GENERALLY BUT IN MY OPINION ERRONEOUSLY ATTRIBUTED TO AN IMMEDIATE SYMPATHY BETWEEN THE PUPILS FOR WHEN THE PUPIL OF ONE EYE BECOMES DILATED FROM THE APPLICATION OF BELLADONNA THE PUPIL OF THE OTHER SO FAR FROM DILATING BECOMES SMALLER IT FOLLOWS THEREFORE THAT THE SIZE OF THE PUPIL IS DEPENDANT NOT ONLY ON THE IMPRESSION OF LIGHT ON THE RETINA OF ITS OWN EYE BUT ON THAT ALSO WHICH IS MIADE ON THE RETINA OF THE OTHER AND THAT THE MOVING OF THE TWO TOGETHER WHICH FOR THE MOST PART TAKES PLACE IS ONLY AN ACCIDENTAL CONSEQUENCE OF THE FACT WHICH I HAVE MENTIONED 2 AS THE ACTION OF THE EXTERNAL MUSCLES OF THE EYE HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY RESORTED TO FOR AN EXPLANATION OF ITS CAPACITY TO SEE OBJECTS PERFECITLY AT DTIFERENT DISTANCES I REQUESTED DR CUTTING TO ATC ND TO THIS MATTER IE ACCORDINGLY ASCERTAINED WHILE HIS EYE WAS IN ITS NATURAL STATE THE DISTANCE FROM HIS FACE OF THE NEAREST POINT AT WHICH HE COULD MAKE THE TWO OPTIC AXES IEET THIS BEING THE GREATEST TRIAL OF STRENGTH TO WHICH THOSE MUSCLES CAN BE EXPOSED SHORTLY AFTER HE RE PEATED THE EXPERIMENTS WHILE IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE APPLICA TION OF BELLADONNA HE WAS WITHOUT THE POWER OF ADAPTING HIS EYE TO DIFFERENT DISTANCES AND FOUND THAT THE STRENGTH OF THOSE MUSCLES WAS NOT DIMINISHED IT FOLLOWS THEREFORE NOT ONLY THAT THE EXTERNAL MUSCLES HAVE LITTLE OR NO CONCERN IN FITTING THE EYE TO SEE DISTINCTLY AT DIFFERENT DISTANCES BUT THAT THE SAME IS TRUE WITH RESPECT TO THE CORNEA AS WE CANNOT SUP POSE THAT ITS MECHANICAL PROPERTIES WERE ALTERED BY THE BELLA DONNA OR AT LEAST THAT IT BECAME MORE INFLEXIBLE FROM THE APPLICATION TO IT OF THE JUICE OF THAT HERB I HAD BEFORE ADE A SIMILAR EXPERIMENT ON MYSELF BY TCOM PAING THAT HAD BEEN THE STRENGTH OF THE EXTERNAL IMUSCES OF MVY CEY TSWENTY YEARS 389DR WELLSS OBSRVATIONS AGO WITH WHAT IT WAS AFTER I HAD LOST THE POWER OF ALTERING TLCIR REFTACTIVE STATE BUT THOUGH I FOUND NO DIFFERENCE YETY AS THEIR COATS MIGHT HAVE IN THE MEAN TIIME BECOME MORE RIGID I THOUGHT IT RIGHT TO HAVE THE EXPERIMENT REPA  IA MAN NER TO WHICH NO OBJECTION COULD BE TAKEN THE ONLY OTHER PART OF THE EYE OR ITS APPENDAGES WHIICH REMAINS FOR ENABLING US TO SEE EQUALLY WELL AT VERY DIFFERET DISANCES IS THE CRYSTALLINE AND THAT IT DOES PRODUCE THIS EFFECT EITHER WLHOLLY OR VERY NEARLY SO IS MANIFEST FROM TLE NECESSITY EVEN YOUNG PERSONS ARE UNDER WHO HAVE LOST IT OF USING LASSES OF VERY DIFFERENT CONVEXITIES FOR NEAR AND REMOTE OBJECTS BT IN WHAT WAY THIS IMPORTANT OFFICE IS PERFORMED BY IT SEEMS STILL UNKNOWN THE LEARNED DR YOUNG INDEED AS WELL AS OTHERS BEFORE HIM HAS SUPPOSED THAT THE CRYSTAL LINE HAS THE POWER OF ALTERING ITS FIGURE BUT THE PROOFS HITHER TO GIVEN IN FAVOUR OF THIS OPINION APPEAR VERY DEFECTIVE IN 1794 I ATTEMPTED TO SUBMIT ITS JUSTNESS TO THE TEST OF DIRECT EXPERIMENTS BY APPLYING TO THE CRYSTALLINES OF OXEN WHICH HAD BEEN FELLED FROM THIRTY SECONDS TO A MINUTE BEFORE CHE MICAL AND MECHANICAL STIMULI AND THOSE OF GALVANISM AND ELECTRICITY BUT IN NO INSTANCE WAS ANY ALTERATION OF FIRURE OR OTHER INDICATION OF MUSCULAR POWER OBSERVED ALL OF THESE STIMULI WERE APPLIED TO THE CRYSTALLINE WHILE IT WAS SURROUNDED BY AIR AND SOME OF THEM VWHILE IT WAS COVERED WITHL WARM V ATER LAST SUMMER AFTER I KNEW THAT MEN LOSE FOM IN CREASE OF YEARS THE FACULTY OF ALIERINGT TAE REFRACTIVE STATE OF THE EYE I THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE THAT THE OXEN ON WHICH I HAD MADE THE EXPERIMENTS WERE TOO OLD FOR THEM I THEREFORE REPEATED MOST OF TENM ON THE CRYSIALINES OF A CAF AND A LAMB BUT T ESSA ON SINGLE VISION C P I36AND EXPERIMENTS ON FISION  9 STILL NO MOTION WAS TO BE SEEN DR YOUNG LHA MADE SIMILAR EXPERIMENTS WITH A SIMILAR EVENT BUT HE THNKS TAT NO ARG MENT CAN HENCE BE DERIVED AGAINST HIS OPINION AS NEITHER CAN MOTION BE EXCITED IN THE UVEA BY ANY ARTIFICIAL STIMULUS N THE FIRST PLACE HOWEVER IT IS NOT AGREEABLE TO JUST REASONING TO REGARD AN UNKNOWN THING AS AN EXCEPTION TO A GENERAL RULE RATHER THAN AS AN EXAMPLE OF T  IN TH SECOND IE MOTIONS OF THE UEA ARE INVOLUNTARY WHEREAS THE ADAPTATION OF THE EYE IS IN ART AT LEAST UNDER THE COMRNAND OF THE WILL AND IN THE THIRD TIE CRYSTALLINE SEEMS VERY UNFIT FOR PERFORMING THE MOTIONS WHICH HE ASSIGNS TO IT FOR IF ITS FIGURE BE ALTERED OUT OF THE BODY BY EXTERNAL FORCE IT DOES NOT RESTORE ITSELF BUT RETAINS THE SHAPE WHICH HAS BEEN GIVEN TO IT LIKE A PIECE OF DOUGH OR SOFT CLAY POSSIBLY FURTHER EXPERIMENTS WITH BEL LADONNA MAY CONTRIBUTE TO REMOVE THE OBSCXRITY WHICH AT PRESENT SURROUNDS THIS SUBJECT

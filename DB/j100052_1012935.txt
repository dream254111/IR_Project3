J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1012935,THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR FOREIGN TRADE UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACT,I242648,THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR FOREIGN TRADE UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACT BY JOHN CLAUSEN MANAGER FOREIGN DEPARTMENT THE CROCKER NATIONAL BANK OF SAN FRANCISCO THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACT WHICH WAS SIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT ON DECEMBER 23 1913 AND HAS SINCE BECOME OPERATIVE BY THE OPEN ING ON NOVEMBER 16 1914 OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS HAS INDEED BECOME A POWERFUL FORCE BEHIND THE BUSINESS MACHINERY OF OUR COUNTRY AND WHILE IT MAY CONTAIN POSSIBILITIES OF ABUSE AND MIS DIRECTED EFFORTS AS A WHOLE IT IS FELT THAT BANKS AND GENERAL BUSINESS WILL BE BENEFITED IN THAT THROUGH ABLE AND HARMONIOUS ACTION ON THE PART OF OUR FINANCIAL ORGANIZATIONS WE WILL BE IN A POSITION TO MORE ADEQUATELY MEET THE GROWING DEMAND FOR INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE ANDIF OUR EXPECTATIONS COME TRUEPREVENT OUR PERIODICAL PANICS WITH THEIR DEMORALIZING EFFECT AND CESSATION OF BUSINESS OF ALL THE EXPERIENCES OF PANICS BITTER AND COSTLY AS SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN PERHAPS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAS THE PROOF IT AFFORDED THAT STRENGTH AND SAFETY ARE TO BE FOUND ONLY IN SYSTEMATIC COMBINA TION WE IN COMMON WITH OTHER ENTERPRISING NATIONS ARE APPROACH ING THE CONDITION OF ECONOMIC MATURITY THE QUESTION IS NOT NOW OF VITAL IMPORTANCE WHETHER TWELVE EIGHT OR ONLY ONE RESERVE BANKING CENTER WILL BRING ABOUT THE DESIRED RESULT WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT OR THE RESERVE BANKS SHOULD EFFECT THE NOTE ISSUE AND THEREBY PROVIDE A MORE ELASTIC CIRCULATING MEDIUM TO BETTER MEET THE GROWING DEMANDS OF OUR COMMERCE AND IT SHOULD THEREFORE BE THE UNBIASED AIM OF ALL MEMBER BANKS TO LEND THEIR EVERY SUPPORT TO THE NEW INSTITUTION WHICH NO DOUBT EVENTUALLY WILL WORK OUT TO THE BENEFIT OF ALL CONCERNED IT IS NECESSARY HOWEVER FOR THE ENTERPRISING BANKER AND BUSI NESS MAN TO MOVE QUICKLY AND CONFORM WITH NEW CONDITIONS IN REORGANIZING FORMER SYSTEMS TO ADVANTAGEOUSLY COPE WITH THE PRES ENT POSSIBILITIES OF BROADER AND BETTER BANKING THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY THE COUNTRY BANKER PARTICULARLY SHOULD ENTER UPON A BROADER FIELD OF OPERATIONS TIME ALONE WILL PROVE WITH WHAT VIGOROUS EFFORTS THE LARGER BANKS THROUGHOUT THE 132FEDERAL RESERVE ACT AND FOREIGN TRADE COUNTRY WILL ENTER INTO COMPETITION BY MEANS OF THE ADDED FACILITIES AFFORDED THEM BY THE NATIONAL BANK AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACTS FOR MAINTAINING BRANCHES AND CONSEQUENT ABSENCE OF RESTRAINT IN RIVALRY FOR BUSINESS RELATIONS WITH THE SMALLER BANKS WHO AS MEM BERS AND DEPOSITORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS WILL IN A MEASURE NO LONGER FIGURE AS CORRESPONDENTS AND CLIENTS WITH THEIR FORMER RESTRICTIVE TERRITORIAL RIGHTS THE NATIONAL BANK ACT AND AMENDATORY THEREOF AND SUPPLEMENTARY THERETO READS SECTION 5155 ACT MARCH 3 1865 IT SHALL BE LAWFUL FOR ANY BANK OR BANK ING ASSOCIATION ORGANIZED UNDER STATE LAWS AND HAVING BRANCHFES THE CAPITAL BEING JOINT AND ASSIGNED TO AND USED BY THE MOTHERBANK AND BRANCHES IN DEFINITE PROPORTIONS TO BECOME A NATIONAL BANKING ASSOCIATION IN CONFORMITY WITH EXISTING LAWS AND TO RETAIN AND KEEP IN OPERATION ITS BRANCHES OR SUCH ONE OR MORE OF THEM AS IT MAY ELECT TO RETAIN THE AMOUNT OF THE CIRCULATION REDEEMABLE AT THE MOTHERBANK AND EACH BRANCH TO BE REGULATED BY THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL ASSIGNED TO AND USED BY EACH EVERY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONTHE SMALL COUNTRY BANK AS ALSO THE LARGE CITY BANKWILL THEREFORE READILY APPRECIATE THE ADVAN TAGE IF NOT THE NECESSITY OF SYSTEMATICALLY PREPARING AND ARRANGING ITS ORGANIZATION FOR THE AWAKENING OF A MORE MODERN BANKING SYSTEM WITH ITS EQUALLY NEW AND DIVERSIFIED MODE OF COMPETITION WITH THE COMMERCIAL LIFE OF A NATION COMMERCE AND BANKING ARE SO CLOSELY INTERWOVEN THAT IT BECOMES ESSENTIAL FOR EVERY PERSON ENGAGED IN BUSINESS TO HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE OF THE PART PLAYED BY THESE FACTORS THE NATURE AND THE USE OF MONEY THE MECHANISM OF EXCHANGE AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF BANKING IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD ARE FEATURES OF VITAL INTEREST TO THE COMMERCIAL MAN IT MAY NOT BE AMISS TO HERE SHOW THE SUCCESSIVE STAGES IN THE EVOLUTION OF OUR PRESENTDAY ORGANIZED SYSTEM OF BANKING THE FIRSTFOR OBVIOUS REASONS TO BE CONSIDERED THE PASTA PERIOD OF INITIATIVE EXPERIMENTS THAT OF BEGINNING AND SLOW BUT STEADY GROWTH THE SECONDTHE PRESENT STAGE OF OUR FINANCIAL MACHINERYGENERALLY TERMED A PERIOD OF TRANSITION THE THIRDWHICH IS STILL BEFORE USMAY RIGHTLY BE DESIGNATED AS THE PERIOD OF COMPLETE MATURITY JUST AS CONDITIONS DIFFER IN THE VARIOUS SECTIONS OF THE UNITED STATES SO DO WE FIND A GREAT DIVERSITY IN SYSTEMS AND METHODS OF OPERATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES IT BECOMES NECESSARY FOR US TO STUDY THESE ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS IN SEEKING ADEQUATE CHANNELS FOR 133THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY EXPANSION OF OUR IMPORT AND EXPORT TRADE AND THEN ARRANGE FOR THE CORRESPONDING FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO ESTABLISH BANKING CONNECTIONS TO CARE FOR AND PROMOTE THE COMMERCE OF OUR FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS INTERESTS THE WORLDS COMMERCE IS ALMOST IN ITS ENTIRETY FINANCED BY BILLS OF EXCHANGE WHICH IN TURN ACT AS AN INDEX TO THE VALUE OF MONEY INCREASED TRADEBOTH DOMESTIC AND FOREIGNVERY LOGICALLY BRINGS ABOUT A CORRESPONDING DEMAND FOR CREDITS AND WHILE IT MAY BE COMPARATIVELY EASY TO CREATE CREDIT IT IS OFTEN A DIFFICULT MATTER TO PROTECT IT WHICH ECONOMICALLY CLAIMED CAN ONLY BE DONE BY MAIN TAINING AN ADEQUATE AMOUNT OF GOLD THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK WITH ITS HOLDING OF GOLD AND LAWFUL MONEY CAN FOR THIS REASON VERY EFFECTIVELY FIND EMPLOYMENT OF ITS RESOURCES IN FOSTERING AND RENDERING ASSISTANCE IN THE FINANCING OF OUR TRADE AS ALSO IN THE CREATION OF A BROADER MARKET IN FOREIGN CENTERS FOR THE AMERICAN BANK CREDIT AND ESPECIALLY IN THE RECOGNI TION OF THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR ACCEPTANCE UNDER THE TERMS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACT A MEMBER BANK IS UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS PERMITTED TO ACCEPT BILLS OF EXCHANGE AND IF LATER REQUIRED TO NEGOTIATE AND OFFER SUCH ACCEPTANCES FOR REDISCOUNT WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK IN THE RESPECTIVE DISTRICT FEDERAL RESERVE ACT SECTION 13 ANY MEMBER BANK MAY ACCEPT DRAFTS OR BILLS OF EXCHANGE DRAWN UPON IT AND GROWING OUT OF TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THE IMPORTATION OR EXPORTATION OF GOODS HAVING NOT MORE THAN SIX MONTHS SIGHT TO RUN BUT NO BANK SHALL ACCEPT SUCH BILLS TO AN AMOUNT EQUAL AT ANY TIME IN THE AGGREGATE TO MORE THAN ONEHALF ITS PAID UP CAPITAL STOCK AND SURPLUS ANY FEDERAL RESERVE BANK MAY DISCOUNT ACCEPTANCES WHICH ARE BASED ON THE IMPORTATION OR EXPORTATION OF GOODS AND WHICH HAVE A MATURITY AT TIME OF DIS COUNT OF NOT MORE THAN THREE MONTHS AND ENDORSED BY AT LEAST ONE MEMBER BANK THE AMOUNT OF ACCEPTANCES SO DISCOUNTED SHALL AT NO TIME EXCEED ONEHALF THE PAID UP CAPITAL STOCK AND SURPLUS OF THE BANK FOR WHICH THE REDISCOUNTS ARE MADE THE REDISCOUNT BY ANY FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF ANY BILLS RECEIVABLE AND OF DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN BILLS OF EXCHANGE AND OF ACCEPTANCES AUTHORIZED BY THIS ACT SHALL BE SUBJECT TO SUCH RESTRICTIONS LIMITATIONS AND REGULATIONS AS MAY BE IMPOSED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD THE POWER OF A BANK TO ACCEPT A DRAFT OR BILL OF EXCHANGE ENABLES IT TO MAKE USE OF AND TO SELL FOR A CONSIDERATION ITS CREDIT AND SO LEND FOR LEGITIMATE USE IN TRADE VAST SUMS WITHOUT DEPLETING ITS RESERVE OR IMPAIRING ITS CAPABILITY FOR MAKING ADDITIONAL LOANS AND ADVANCES TO ITS CLIENTS 134FEDERAL RESERVE ACT AND FOREIGN TRADE WHILE THE ACT PERMITS MEMBER BANKS TO ACCEPT BILLS OF EXCHANGE THEY ARE NOT AT PRESENT AUTHORIZED TO EXTEND SUCH FACILITIES TO CLIENTS FOR THE ACCEPTANCE OF DRAFTS COVERING DOMESTIC TRANSACTIONS ALTHOUGH THE STATE BANKING LAW IN NEW YORK GIVES PERMISSION TO STATE BANKS AND TRUST COMPANIES TO EXTEND THESE FACILITIES FOR BOTH FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC TRANSACTIONS THIS IS LIKEWISE THE CASE IN MARYLAND UTAH VERMONT AND TEXASTHE LATTER RESTRICTED TO FOREIGN ACCEPTANCES ONLYBUT THE LAWS OF OTHER STATES CARRY NO PROVISION FOR BANKS EXTENDING TO THEIR CUSTOMERS THE USE OF THEIR CREDIT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMMERCIAL RELATIONS AND IT WOULD SEEM APPARENT THAT STATE BANK LEGISLATION THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES SHOULD BE AMENDED TO HARMONIOUSLY CONFORM TO THE NEW AND BETTER SYSTEM THE NEW YORK BANKING LAW OF APRIL 16 1914 PROVIDES THAT BANKS AND TRUST COMPANIES UNDER SUPERVISION OF THE STATE BANKING DEPARTMENT ARE PERMITTED TO ACCEPT FOR PAYMENT AT A FUTURE DATE DRAFTS MADE UPON THEM BY THEIR CUSTOMERS AND ISSUE LETTERS OF CREDIT AUTHORIZING THE HOLDER THEREOF TO DRAW DRAFTS UPON THEM OR THEIR CORRESPONDENTS AT SIGHT OR ON TIME NOT EXCEEDING ONE YEAR THE BUSINESS OF BANKING UNDER THE PRESENT LAW AND SPHERE OF ACTIVITY THEREFORE EMBRACES PRINCIPALLY THE FUNCTION OF COLLECTING LENDING CAPITAL AND EXTENDING CREDIT WHICH LATTER IS NOT EASY TO OVERESTIMATE IN ITS ADVANTAGES TO COMMERCE AND CIVILIZATION AMENDMENTS TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACT OF A TECHNICAL NATURE DESIGNED TO STRENGTHEN THE SYSTEM ARE BEING CONSIDERED BY MEMBERS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND WILL IN ALL PROBABILITY BE LAID BEFORE CONGRESS AT ITS NEXT SESSION ONE OF THE PROPOSED AMEND MENTS WOULD CHANGE THE LAW SO THAT ACCEPTANCES BASED UPON DOMESTIC AND COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS MIGHT BE HANDLED BY FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACT IS ESSENTIALLY INTENDED TO BRING INTO EXISTENCE A COMMERCIAL BANKING SYSTEM TO ASSIST IN THE FINANCING OF OUR INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL TRADE AND PROVIDE A MARKET FOR COMMERCIAL ACCEPTANCES BASED UPON THE IMPORTATION AND EXPORTATION OF GOODS AT THE SAME TIME PROVIDING FOR AN AUTOMATIC REGISTRATION OF SUCH OPERATIONS WHICH IS A VERY VITAL FEATURE TO PREVENT OVER EXTENSION OF CREDIT IN THE CASE OF TIME BILLS OF EXCHANGE DRAWN ON AND ACCEPTED BY BANKS OR BANKERS OF HIGH STANDING THERE IS PRACTICAL UNIFORMITY OF SECURITY WHICH CANNOT BE CLAIMED FOR COMMERCIAL 135THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY PAPER WITH WHICH THE FINANCIAL MARKETS HERE ARE SUPPLIED THE STRENGTH OF SUCH OBLIGATIONS DEPENDING UPON THE STANDING OF MIS CELLANEOUS COMMERCIAL INTERESTS WHILE WE CANNOT HOPE TO SEE THE NEW YORK OR SAN FRANCISCO BILL OF EXCHANGE TAKE THE PLACE OF THE SO WELL AND FAVORABLY KNOWN BILLS ON LONDON HAMBURG OR PARIS RECENT EVENTS AND DISLOCATION OF THE FINANCIAL STRUCTURE IN EUROPE HAVE AT LEAST BROUGHT THE POSSIBILITY BEFORE THE COMMERCIAL WORLD AND TENDED TO BRING WITHIN OUR REACH THE POWER OF COMPETING ON TERMS OF EQUALITY WITH OUR EUROPEAN CONTEMPORARIES A MERCHANT FOR INSTANCE INSTEAD OF BORROWING CASH ON A NOTE FROM HIS BANKER MAY ARRANGEFOR A STIPULATED COMMISSION CHARGE TO USE THE BANKS CREDIT FOR A CERTAIN LENGTH OF TIME AND A GIVEN AMOUNT TO MAKE USE OF SUCH FACILITIES A TIME DRAFT MAY BE ISSUED AGAINST THE BANK WHICH IN TURN GIVES THE REQUIRED ACCEPTANCE AFTER THIS REQUISITE HAS BEEN SECURED THE MERCHANT IS IN POSITION TO EITHER USE THE BILL OF EXCHANGE IN THE SETTLEMENT OF HIS TRADE OBLIGA TIONS OR SELL THE SAME THROUGH A BILL BROKER IN THE OPEN MARKET AND SO OBTAIN AVAILABLE CASH THE SMALL MERCHANTS PAPER ENDORSED BY HIS BANK IS AS ACCEPTABLE AS THAT OF THE LARGEST MERCHANT OR CORPORA TION BACKED AS IT IS BY SECURITY OF THE BANK AND THEREFORE READILY DISCOUNTABLE BY VIRTUE OF ITS HIGH INTRINSIC SECURITY AS THE MOST LIQUID FORM OF INVESTMENT IT IS IN THIS CLASS OF PAPER THAT THE COUNTRY BANKS WILL IN FUTURE INVEST THEIR SURPLUS FUNDS AND IT IS GRATIFYING TO NOTE THAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS ALREADY HAVE PURCHASED AS AN INVESTMENT SOME 14000000 OF SUCH BILLSBOTH WITH AND WITHOUT THE ENDORSE MENT OF MEMBER BANKSFOR UNDER THE LAW THEY CAN DEAL IN ACCEPT ANCES OF FIRMS CORPORATIONS INDIVIDUALS FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC BANKS EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE NOT SECURED FROM THEIR MEMBERS FEDERAL RESERVE ACT SECTION 14 ANY FEDERAL RESERVE BANK MAY UNDER RULES AND REGULATIONS PRESCRIBED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD PURCHASE AND SELL IN THE OPEN MARKET AT HOME OR ABROAD EITHER FROM OR TO DOMESTIC OR FOREIGN BANKS FIRMS CORPORA TIONS OR INDIVIDUALS CABLE TRANSFERS AND BANKERS ACCEPTANCES AND BILLS OF EXCHANGE OF THE KINDS AND MATURITIES BY THIS ACT MADE ELIGIBLE FOR REDISCOUNT WITH OR WITH OUT THE ENDORSEMENT OF A MEMBER BANK EVERY FEDERAL RESERVE BANK SHALL HAVE POWER TO ESTABLISH ACCOUNTS WITH OTHER FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS FOR EXCHANGE PURPOSES AND WITH THE CONSENT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD TO OPEN AND MAINTAIN BANKING ACCOUNTS IN FOREIGN COUN 136FEDERAL RESERVE ACT AND FOREIGN TRADE TRIES APPOINT CORRESPONDENTS AND ESTABLISH AGENCIES IN SUCH COUNTRIES WHERESOEVER IT MAY DEEM BEST FOR THE PURPOSE OF PURCHASING SELLING AND COLLECTING BILLS OF EXCHANGE AND TO BUY AND SELL WITH OR WITHOUT ITS ENDORSEMENT THROUGH SUCH CORRESPONDENTS OR AGENCIES BILLS OF EXCHANGE ARISING OUT OF ACTUAL COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS WHICH HAVE NOT MORE THAN NINETY DAYS TO RUN AND WHICH BEAR THE SIGNATURES OF TWO OR MORE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES TIME BILLS OF EXCHANGE FORM A CONSIDERABLE PROPORTION OF THE RESERVES OF THE GREAT BANKS IN EUROPE THE MATTER OF A READY DISCOUNT MARKET COMPARING FAVORABLY WITH PREVAILING CONDITIONS IN PRINCIPAL CENTERS ABROAD IS WORTHY OF VERY SERIOUS CONSIDERATION AND WHILE THE FEATURE OF DISCOUNT AND REDISCOUNT PROVIDED FOR IN THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACT MAY IN THE MAIN BE REGARDED AS IN THE NATURE OF A SAFETY MEASURE IT IS HOPED THAT AS A PRINCIPAL AID TO A MORE LIBERAL SYSTEM OF FINANCING OUR DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN TRADE THE AMERICAN MARKET MAY EFFECTIVELY ADJUST ITS RATES TO CONFORM WITH THOSE PREVAILING IN OTHER FINANCIAL CENTERS OF THE WORLD OF COURSE THE VALUE OF MONEY APART FROM THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE OPEN MARKET RATE OF DISCOUNT IS SLIGHTLY UNDER OR SLIGHTLY OVER THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK RATE WILL BE GOVERNED BY THE STRENGTH OF THAT INSTITUTION AND THE PROSPECT OF A DEMAND UPON ITS STOCK OF GOLD RESERVE AS IS THE CASE WITH OUR BRITISH FRIENDS AND THEIR RELATIONS WITH THE BANK OF ENGLAND SINGLENAME PAPER WILL NOT CREATE A DISCOUNT MARKET AS WE FIND THEM IN LONDON PARIS AND GERMANY WHERE THE FLUCTUATIONS OF RATES SO LARGELY DEPEND ON THE DEMAND FOR AND SUPPLY OF MARKETABLE BILLS OF EXCHANGE WHICH OWE THEIR ORIGIN TO TRADE TRANSACTIONS AS BALANCED AGAINST THE DEMAND FOR AND SUPPLY OF MONEY LOW DIS COUNT RATES ARE AN INCENTIVE TO THE REVIVAL OF TRADE AND ADVANCING RATES IN TURN ACT AS A NATURAL CHECK ON TRADE AND PRODUCE A GRADUAL INCREASE OR DECREASE IN THE DEMAND FOR MONEY WHILE THESE CONDITIONS ARE SYMPTOMS IN GOVERNING THE DISCOUNT RATES IN EUROPE OUR CALL LOAN RATE AS QUOTED IN OUR EASTERN MARKETS HAS ONLY AN INDIRECT RELATION TO TRADE CONDITIONS AND REGIS TERS MAINLY THE SPECULATIVE DEMAND FOR STOCKS IT IS APPARENT THAT IT WILL REQUIRE SOMETHING MORE THAN THE OFFERING OF GOODS TO BUILD UP AND HOLD THE TRADE THAT WE ARE NOW IN POSITION TO CONTROL BY REASON OF THE TEMPORARY TRADE INACTIVITY OF OUR EUROPEAN CONTEMPORARIES WHO ARE AT PRESENT USING THEIR ENERGIES 137THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF USEFUL PRODUCTION IN TRADE AND COMMERCE TO THE MECHANISM AND WORK OF DESTRUCTION ON THE EFFICIENCY OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACT MUST DEPEND TO A LARGE EXTENT THE PROSPECTS OF A GREAT AND FAVORABLE CHANGE IN THE INTERNATIONAL POSITION OF THE UNITED STATES WHICH WILL NOW ENTER INTO THE COMPETITIVE FIELD OF OPERATIONS OF OTHER GREAT FINANCIAL NATIONS THE EXPORT TRADE FROM ALL PORTS OF THE UNITED STATES DURING THE FISCAL YEAR JUST ENDEDELEVEN MONTHS OF WHICH WERE WITHIN THE PERIOD OF THE EUROPEAN WARATTAINED THE AMAZING TOTAL OF OVER 2700000000 OR APPROXIMATELY 1100000000 MORE THAN THE VALUE OF OUR IMPORTS THESE INCREASED FIGURES ARE LARGELY COVERED BY OUR EXPORTS TO EUROPEAN COUNTRIESWITH A CONTINUOUS BALANCE OF TRADE RUNNING VERY HEAVILY IN OUR FAVORAND THE UNSETTLEMENT OF FOREIGN EX CHANGES IS CONSEQUENTLY A MATTER FOR SERIOUS CONSIDERATION WHICH AT PRESENT IS UPPERMOST IN THE MINDS OF OUR COMMERCIAL AND FINANCIAL INTERESTS WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT THE GOLD PAR VALUES OF THE THREE PRINCIPAL EXCHANGES ARE QUOTED RESPECTIVELY AS 486656 FOR THE ENGLISH POUND STERLING FRCS 51826 VALUE OF 100 FOR THE FRENCH FRANC 0952852 VALUE OF MKS 400 FOR THE GERMAN REICHSMARK AND THAT DURING THE FIRST FEW MONTHSSUCCEEDING THE START OF THE EUROPEAN WAROUR MERCHANTS HAVE BEEN CALLED UPON TO EFFECT LIQUIDATION AT 500 TO 600 FOR THE POUND STERLING 20C 500 FOR THE FRENCH FRANC AND 24C 098 FOR THE GERMAN MARK WITH THE PROBLEM BEFORE US OF AN EQUAL UNJUSTIFIED DECLINE IN THESE EXCHANGES WHEN BANKS HAVE BEEN SELLING THE POUND STERLING AT 450 FRANCS AT 604 AND REICHSMARKS AT 081IT SHOULD PROVE OF PARTICULAR CONCERN TO THE COMMERCIAL INTERESTS IN THIS COUNTRY AND NOT A DIFFICULT MATTER TO CONVINCE OUR EUROPEAN CONNECTIONS THAT THE TIME IS OPPORTUNE FOR MAKING THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR THE BASIS OF FUTURE TRANSACTIONS IT SHOULD BE THE EARNEST ENDEAVOR OF EVERY MERCHANT AND BANKER IN OUR COUNTRY TO GIVE THE AMERICAN DOLLAR THE PLACE IT DESERVES IN OUR INTERNATIONAL TRADE IT WOULD IN MY OPINION REQUIRE ENORMOUS RESOURCES AND ESPE CIALLY INTIMATE CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS WITH OUR FOREIGN FINANCIAL CON TEMPORARIES TO MAINTAIN HERE A MORE ORDERLY AND STABLER MARKET FOR THEIR EXCHANGESTAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE HUNDRED MILLION OR 138FEDERAL RESERVE ACT AND FOREIGN TRADE MORE OF FAVORABLE MONTHLY TRADE BALANCE WHICH THE UNITED STATES IS NOW ENJOYING WHILE THE PRESENT LOW EXCHANGE LEVELS WILL MATERIALLY AFFECT THE INTERESTS OF OUR EXPORTERS THE HEAVIER BURDEN WILL LATER DESCEND UPON THE IMPORTERS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES WHO WILL BE OBLIGED IF MY CONCEPTION IS CLEAR TO PROVIDE FOR PAYMENT IN AMERICAN DOLLARS TO COVER FUTURE PURCHASES IT MAY BE OF INTEREST HERE TO SHOW HOW UNDER PRESENT CONDITIONS A SHIPMENT FOR EXAMPLE OF COFFEE FROM GUATEMALA MAY BE FINANCED IN UNITED STATES DOLLARS OVER NEW YORK OR SAN FRANCISCO INSTEAD OF LONDON PARIS OR GERMANY AS HERETOFORE THE SHIPPER IN GUATEMALA IS NOT IN A POSITION WE WILL SAY TO AWAIT THE ARRIVAL OF THE SHIPMENT IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE CORRE SPONDING REIMBURSEMENT BEFORE RECEIVING IN CASH THE AMOUNT OF HIS INVOICE AND ON THE OTHER HAND THE PURCHASER HERE IS UNABLE FOR VARIOUS REASONS TO EFFECT PAYMENT BEFORE THE GOODS ARRIVE AND UNTIL THEY HAVE BEEN PAID FOR BY HIS CUSTOMERS A COMMERCIAL LETTER OF CREDIT IS THEREFORE SUGGESTED AND SUPPLIED BY HIS LOCAL BANK WHICH AUTHORIZES THE SHIPPER IN GUATE MALA TO DRAW AGAINST THE ISSUING BANK IN THIS COUNTRY OR ITS CORRE SPONDENT IN NEW YORK SAN FRANCISCO NEW ORLEANS ETC SAY AT NINETY DAYS SIGHT WITH SHIPPING DOCUMENTS ATTACHED TO COVER THE VALUE OF SHIPMENT THE LETTER OF CREDIT IS DELIVERED TO THE MERCHANT HERE AGAINST THE USUAL GUARANTEE AND HE IN TURN FORWARDS THE SAME TO THE SHIPPING FIRM IN GUATEMALA WITH THE NECESSARY INSTRUCTIONS TO EFFECT SHIP MENT WITHIN A SPECIFIED TIME ALSO STATED IN THE CREDIT AS WELL AS THE MANNER IN WHICH THE INSURANCE IS TO BE CARED FOR IMMEDIATELY UPON RECEIPT OF THIS INSTRUMENT THE SHIPPER ARRANGES TO FORWARD THE COFFEE OBTAINS THE REQUIRED SET OF BILLS OF LADING INVOICES AND INSURANCE CERTIFICATES AND TAKES THE SAME TO HIS LOCAL BANKER WHO PREPARES A BILL OF EXCHANGE IN TERMS WITH THE CREDIT THE ISSUANCE IS THEN NEGOTIATED AND THE SHIPPER RECEIVES HIS MONEY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN BANKER SUBSEQUENTLY FORWARDS THE BILL OF EXCHANGE AND DOCUMENTS TO HIS AGENT IN THE UNITED STATES WHO SECURES THE NECESSARY ACCEPTANCE AFTER WHICH THE BILL IS HELD FOR MATURITY OR DISCOUNTED AS MAY BEST SUIT THE INTERESTS OF THE NEGOTIATING BANK IN CENTRAL AMERICA UPON ACCEPTANCE OF THE BILL THE BANK HERE GIVING THAT REQUISITE RETAINS THE DOCUMENTS TO BE LATER DELIVERED TO ITS CLIENT UNDER WHAT IS TERMED A TRUST RECEIPT 139THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY AND AFTER DEFRAYING THE AMOUNT OF DUTIES THE INTERESTED PARTY OBTAINS POSSESSION OF THE COFFEE UPON DATE OF MATURITY OF THE ACCEPTANCE GRANTING THAT IT WAS GIVEN IN SAN FRANCISCO OR FIVE DAYS PRIOR IF CREDIT WAS ISSUED IN SAN FRANCISCO WITH DRAFTS PAYABLE IN NEW YORK THE AMOUNT IS COLLECTED FROM THE CLIENT WHO IS ALSO CALLED UPON TO PAY THE USUAL COMMISSION CHARGES AND IN THIS MANNER THE NEGOTIATION IS CONCLUDED IT IS OPINED THAT WE AS A NATION CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP OUR FOREIGN TRADE SO LONG AS IT IS NECESSARY FOR US TO OPERATE THROUGH BANKING INSTITUTIONS OF COMPETING COUNTRIES AND WHILE THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACT PROVIDES FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT BY MEMBER BANKS OF BRANCHES IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES IT IS FELT THAT FEW BANKS CARE TO ASSUME THE RISK SEPARATELY FEDERAL RESERVE ACT SECTION 25 ANY NATIONAL BANKING ASSOCIATION POSSESSING A CAPITAL AND SURPLUS OF 1000000 OR MORE MAY FILE APPLICATION WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD UPON SUCH CONDITIONS AND UNDER SUCH REGULATIONS AS MAY BE PRESCRIBED BY THE SAID BOARD FOR THE PURPOSE OF SECURING AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH BRANCHES IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES OR DEPENDENCIES OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE FURTHERANCE OF THE FOREIGN COMMERCE OF THE UNITED STATES AND TO ACT IF REQUIRED TO DO SO AS FISCAL AGENTS OF THE UNITED STATES SUCH APPLICATION SHALL SPECIFY IN ADDITION TO THE NAME AND CAPITAL OF THE BANKING ASSOCIATION FILING IT THE PLACE OR PLACES WHERE THE BANKING OPERATIONS PROPOSED ARE TO BE CARRIED ON AND THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL SET ASIDE FOR THE CONDUCT OF ITS FOREIGN BUSINESS THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD SHALL HAVE POWER TO APPROVE OR TO REJECT SUCH APPLICATION IF IN ITS JUDGMENT THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL PROPOSED TO BE SET ASIDE FOR THE CONDUCT OF FOREIGN BUSINESS IS INADEQUATE OR IF FOR OTHER REASONS THE GRANTING OF SUCH APPLICATION IS DEEMED INEXPEDIENT EVERY NATIONAL BANKING ASSOCIATION WHICH SHALL RECEIVE AUTHORITY TO ESTAB LISH FOREIGN BRANCHES SHALL BE REQUIRED AT ALL TIMES TO FURNISH INFORMATION CONCERN ING THE CONDITION OF SUCH BRANCHES TO THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY UPON DE MAND AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD MAY ORDER SPECIAL EXAMINATIONS OF THE SAID FOREIGN BRANCHES AT SUCH TIME OR TIMES AS IT MAY DEEM BEST EVERY SUCH NATIONAL BANKING ASSOCIATION SHALL CONDUCT THE ACCOUNT OF EACH FOREIGN BRANCH INDEPENDENTLY OF THE ACCOUNTS OF OTHER FOREIGN BRANCHES ESTABLISHED BY IT AND OF ITS HOME OFFICE AND SHALL AT THE END OF EACH FISCAL PERIOD TRANSFER TO ITS GENERAL LEDGER THE PROFIT OR LOSS ACCRUING AT EACH BRANCH AS A SEPARATE ITEM A BILL WILL PROBABLY BE INTRODUCED IN CONGRESS IN DECEMBER PROVIDING THAT MEMBER BANKS MAY CO6PERATE FOR THE PURPOSE OF JOINTLY OWNING AND OPERATING FOREIGN BANKS JOINTLY OWNED FOREIGN BANKS WOULD APPEAR TO BEST SERVE THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE CO6PERATION THRIVES BEST 140FEDERAL RESERVE ACT AND FOREIGN TRADE WHERE ACTION THROUGH ASSOCIATION IS LEGALLY POSSIBLE AND PRACTICALLY SAFE WE ARE ALL AWARE THAT THERE IS AN UNDOUBTED TENDENCY ON THE PART OF OUR COMMERCIAL ELEMENT TO SECURE IF POSSIBLE AN ENLARGEMENT OF THE FUNCTIONS PERFORMED BY BANKS IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE CON SERVATISM NATURAL AND PROPER TO BANKERS LEADS THEM TO VIEW SUCH A TENDENCY WITH UNDUE SUSPICION BUT JUST AS THE CONCEPTION OF A BANKERS FUNCTION HAS BEEN VASTLY WIDENED SINCE THE DAYS OF OLD SO THE PROCESS WILL CONTINUE IN THE DAYS THAT ARE TO COME DEVELOP MENTS OF THIS KIND ARE HEALTHY AND WISE MEN WILL NOT BE DISPOSED TO OBSTRUCT THEM A NATION THAT WOULD PROSPER IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE MUST FIRST BECOME A WORLD BANKER AND THE WEALTH AND POWER OF THIS COUNTRY ENTITLES IT TO A POSITION OF LEADERSHIP IN EVERY MARKET A COMBINATION OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND FORCES ECONOMIC POLITICAL AND MORAL IS BRINGING OUR PEOPLE EACH DAY TO A FULLER REALIZATION OF THE PART WE ARE CALLED UPON TO PLAY IN GIVING TO THE WORLD AN EXAMPLE OF THE POSSIBILITY AND PRACTICABILITY OF INTERNATIONAL CO6PERATION AS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ENTERS INTO THE INTERNATIONAL ARENA IT BECOMES MORE AND MORE APPARENT THAT NATIONAL SOLIDARITY SHOULD BE CAREFULLY BUILT UP AND CONSISTENTLY NOURISHED OUR COUNTRY IS LARGER THAN ANY NATIONAL UNIT WHICH HAS EVER TAKEN A PART IN THE WORLDS HISTORY IT APPEARS TO ME THAT OUR PROBLEMS WILL CONSEQUENTLY BE GREATER AND THAT THEY WILL REQUIRE A SOUNDER AND MORE CONSISTENT STUDY THAN IT HAS BEEN NECESSARY TO DEVOTE TO OUR PROBLEMS DURING THE RICH DAYS OF OUR YOUTHFUL AND ALMOST BOUNDLESS DEVELOPMENT WHEN WE FACE THE MARKETS OF THE WORLD THERE SHOULD NOT BE A WESTERN OR AN EASTERN POINT OF VIEW TO BE MET BY OUR FOREIGN CUSTOMERS WE SHOULD BE UNITED NOT MERELY IN OUR LOYALTY TO THE FLAG BUT IN THE INTELLIGENT UNDERSTANDING OF ALL THE FUNDAMENTALS OF OUR BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC LIFE MAY I AFFIRM IN CONCLUSION THAT IF OUR PEOPLE HAVE THE COM MERCIAL SAGACITY TO RECOGNIZE THE DRIFT OF EVENTS AND TO ACT IN ACCORD ANCE WITH THE SPIRIT OF THE TIMES THERE OUGHT TO BE NO SERIOUS DIFFI CULTIES IN BRINGING ABOUT AN EXPANSION OF FOREIGN TRADE RELATIONS THAT WILL GIVE US A FAR MORE POTENT INFLUENCE THAN THIS COUNTRY HAS EVER BEFORE EXERCISED IN THE COUNCILS OF THE NATIONS AND SO BECOME A POWERFUL FACTOR IN THE MAINTENANCE OF INTERNATIONAL PEACEWHICH FOR EVERY COUNTRY IS THE GREATEST OF ALL ACHIEVEMENTS 141

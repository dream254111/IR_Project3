FRENCH BY JAMES PARSONS M D F R S S I R ST GERMAIN MAY 20 1752 N S T H E FAVOUR DONE ME BY THE ROYAL SOCIETY OBLIGING ME TO INTEREST MYSELF IN WHATSOEVER CONCERNS THEIR HONOUR I BEG YOU WILL COMMUNICATE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNT READ MAY 28 1752 THE PHILADELPHIAN EXPERIMENTS THAT MR COLLIN SON A MEMBER OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY WAS SO KIND AS TO COMMUNICATE TO THE PUBLIC HAVING BEEN UNIVERSALLY ADMIRED IN FRANCE THE KING DESIRED TO SEE THEM PER FORMED WHEREFORE THE DUKE DAYEN OFFERD HIS MA JESTY HIS COUNTRYHOUSE AT ST GERMAIN WHERE M DE LOR MASTER OF EXPERIMENTAL PHILOSOPHY SHOULD PUT THOSE OF PHILADELPHIA IN EXECUTION HIS MAJESTY SAW THEM WITH GREAT SATISFACTION AND GREATLY APPLAUDED MESSIEURS FRANKLIN AND COLLINSON THESE APPLAUSES OF HIS MAJESTY HAVING EXCITED IN MESSIEURS DE BUFFON DALIBARD AND DE LOR A DESIRE OF VERIFYING THE CON JECTURES OF MR FRANKLIN UPON THE ANALOGY OF THUN DER AND ELECTRICITY THEY PREPARD THEMSELVES FOR MAKE ING THE EXPERIMENTS M DALIBARD CHOSE FOR THIS PURPOSE A GARDEN SITUATED AT MARLY WHERE HE PLACED UPON AN ELECTRI CAL BODY A POINTED BAR OF IRON OF 40 FEET HIGH ON THE 10 OF MAY 20 MINUTES PAST 2 AFTERNOON A STORMY CLOUD535 CLOUD HAVING PASSED OVER THE PLACE WHERE THE BAR STOOD THOSE THAT WERE APPOINTED TO OBSERVE IT DREW NEAR AND ATTRACTED FROM IT SPARKS OF FIRE PERCEIVING THE SAME KIND OF COMMOTIONS AS IN THE COMMON ELECTRICAL EXPERIMENTS M DE LOR SENSIBLE OF THE GOOD SUCCESS OF THIS EX PERIMENT RESOLVED TO REPEAT IT AT HIS HOUSE IN THE ESTRAPADE AT PARIS HE RAISED A BAR OF IRON 99 FEET HIGH PLACED UPON A CAKE OF RESIN TWO FEET SQUARE AND 3 INCHES THICK ON THE 18 OF MAY BETWEEN 4 AND 5 IN THE AFTERNOON A STORMY CLOUD HAVING PASSED OVER THE BAR WHERE IT REMAIND HALF AN HOUR HE DREW SPARKS FROM THE BAR THESE SPARKS WERE LIKE THOSE OF A GUN WHEN IN THE ELECTRICAL EXPERIMENTS THE GLOBE IS ONLY RUBBD BY THE CUSHION AND THEY PRODUCED THE SAME NOISE THE SAME FIRE AND THE SAME CRACKLING THEY DREW THE STRONGEST SPARKS AT THE DISTANCE OF 9 LINES WHILE THE RAIN MINGLED WITH A LITTLE HAIL FELL FROM THE CLOUD WITHOUT EITHER THUN DER OR LIGHTNING THIS CLOUD BEING ACCORDING TO ALL APPEARANCE ONLY THE CONSEQUENCE OF A STORM WHICH HAPPEND ELSEWHERE FROM THIS EXPERIMENT WE CONJECTURD THAT A BAR OF IRON PLACED IN A HIGH SITUATION UPON AN ELECTRICAL BODY MIGHT ATTRACT THE STORM AND DEPRIVE THE CLOUD OF ALL ITS THUNDER I DO NOT DOUBT BUT THE ROYAL SO CIETY HAS DIRECTED SOME OF ITS MEMBERS TO PURSUE THESE EXPERIMENTS AND TO PUSH THIS ANALOGY YET FURTHER I DO NOT KNOW SIR WHETHER MR FRANKLINS LETTERS WERE BEFORE YOUR CONSIDERATIONS UPON EARTHQUAKES IF THEY WERE WE ARE OBLIGD TO MR COLLINSON FOR HIS COM MUNICATION OF MR FRANKLINS NOTIONS IF THEY ARE NOT YOU DESERVE THE HONOUR OF THE DISCOVERY AND WHOSE 6 SOEVER536 SOEVER IT BE IT IS STILL TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY WE OWE THE COMMUNICATION OF THIS INGENIOUS THOUGHT WHICH THE EXPERIMENTS OF M D ALIBARD AND M DE LOR HAVE CONFIRMD THESE TWO LEARNED MEN DESERVE THAT ESTEEM OF OUR NATION WHICH THEIR TALENTS HAVE A LONG TIME PROCURED THEM I AM WITH A PROFOUND RESPECT S I R YOUR MOST HUMBLE AND OBEDIENT SERVANT G MAZEAS S I R ST GERMAINS JUNE 14 1752 MONSIEUR D ALIBARD THE TRANSLATOR OF MR FRANKLINS TREATISE RELATING TO ELECTRICITY ACKNOWLEGES THAT THE INGENIOUS DISCOVERY OF THE ANALOGY BETWEEN THUNDER AND ELECTRICAL MATTER IS DUE TO YOU SINCE YOU WERE THE FIRST  WHO GAVE US A CLEAR IDEA OF IT I OUGHT TO NOT BE WANTING TO GIVE YOU AN ACCOUNT OF THE ADVANCES WHICH THIS DISCOVERY HAS MADE IN THIS COUNTRY READ NOV 23 1752 ON  IN THIS THE ABBE MAZEAS HAS NOT BEEN SUFFICIENTLY WELL IN FORMED AS FOR SEVERAL YEARS THIS ANALOGY HAS BEEN DEDUCED BY SE VERAL GENTLEMEN OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY WHO WERE ENGAGED IN THESE PURSUITS EVEN THE LATE MR STEPHEN GRAY SO EARLY AS THE YEAR 1735 TAKES NOTICE OF IT AND SAYS  THAT THIS ELECTRIC FIRE BY SE  VERAL OF THESE EXPERIMENTS SEEMS TO BE OF THE SAME NATURE WITH  THAT OF THUNDER AND LIGHTNING SEE PHIL TRANS N 436537 ON THE 7 OF JUNE A VIOLENT STORM HAPPENING AT PARIS AND ABOUT IT THE GREATER PART OF THE PHILOSO PHERS ENDEAVOURD TO REPEAT THE EXPERIMENT WHICH I HAD THE HONOUR TO MENTION IN MY LAST LETTER I WAS ASSURED THAT NO ONE SUCCEEDED AT PARIS SOME LOOK ING UPON THE EXPERIMENT AS FALSE WHILE OTHERS ATTRI BUTED THEIR WANT OF SUCCESS TO THE ABUNDANCE OF RAIN THAT WET THE CAKES OF RESIN WHICH THEY USED TO SUP PORT THE BAR OF IRON M LE MONNIER HAVING PREPARED TO REPEAT THE SAME EXPERIMENT HERE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE DUKE DAYEN AVOIDED THAT INCONVENIENCE IN THE RESIN CAKES HE PLACED IN THE GARDEN OF THE HOTEL DE NOAILLES A WOODEN POLE OF ABOUT 30 FEET HIGH AT THE END OF WHICH WAS FIXD A LARGE GLASS TUBE WHICH RECEIVD AT THE OTHER END A LONG TIN PIPE AND THIS PIPE RECEIVD AGAIN IN ITS TURN A POINTED BAR OF IRON OF ABOUT 6 FEET HIGH THE GLASS TUBE AS YOU SEE WAS INSTEAD OF THE CAKE OF RESIN TO HINDER THE COMMUNICATION OF THE ELEC TRICITY FROM THE TIN PIPE TO THE POLE A WIRE WAS CARRIED FROM THE BAR OF IRON WHICH RESTED UPON A SILKEN CORD ABOUT 50 PACES FROM THE POLE BUT RAIN COMING ON THE WIRE WAS CONDUCTED INTO THE HOUSE WE PERCEIVED THE COMMOTIONS OF THE ELECTRICAL MAT TER FROM THE FIRST CLAP OF THUNDER IT PRODUCED SPARKS AND THERE WERE CERTAIN INTERVALS WHEREIN THE COM MOTIONS WERE SO STRONG THAT THEY WERE ACCOMPA NIED WITH VERY SHARP PAIN AND I AM PERSUADED THAT IF THE TINPIPE HAD TRIPLE OR QUADRUPLE MORE SURFACE NO ONE COULD TOUCH THE BAR OF IRON WITHOUT PAYING DEARLY FOR IT IT SEEMD TO ME AS IF THE COMMO TION WAS THE GREATER THE NEARER THE THUNDER WAS TO THE BAR THIS IS THE EXPERIMENT THAT WAS EXECUTED Y Y Y HERE538 HERE WHICH I WAS A WITNESS TO THE FEAR THAT SEIZD SEVERAL LADIES WHO WERE PRESENT HINDERD ITS CONTI NUATION AND WE WERE EVEN OBLIGED TO TAKE AWAY THE BAR AND THE WHOLE APPARATUS AFTER THIS EXPERIMENT I PROPOSD SATISFYING MYSELF CONCERNING A NOTION I CONCEIVD AND WHICH THE WEA THER SUFFERD ME TO EXECUTE BUT IMPERFECTLY THE NATURE OF THE VAPOURS WHICH COMPOSE THUNDER IS NOT ABSOLUTELY UNKNOWN TO US WOULD NOT THE MIXTURE OF SALTS SULPHUR PYRITES INFERREDINFERREDC PRODUCE VAPOURS CAPABLE OF ELECTRISING A BAR OF IRON BY SUSPENDING A BAR OF IRON UPON SILKEN CORDS AND CAUSING A WIRE TO DESCEND INTO A LARGE GLASS RECIPIENT WHEREIN PYRITES AND OTHER ANALOGOUS MATTERS AS SEASALT WITH OIL OF VITRIOL MAY BE MADE TO FERMENT IN ORDER TO PRODUCE A VAPOUR WHICH WOULD CONTAIN SPIRIT OF SALT OR WHICH MIGHT DEVELOPE THE ELECTRICAL MATTER MIGHT NOT WE COME TO PRODUCE THE SAME PHAENOMENON WITH THAT PRO DUCED IN A STORM UPON THIS FOOTING I TRIED SOME EXPERIMENTS WHICH MY BUSINESS HINDERD ME FROM PURSUING BUT THE SUCCESS DID NOT PERFECTLY ANSWER MY EXPECTATION I THOUGHT I PERCEIVD SOME SIGNS OF ELECTRICITY BUT THEY WERE SO DOUBTFUL THAT I DO NOT MENTION THEM IF I MAKE ANY FUTURE ATTEMPTS OF THIS KIND I SHALL HAVE THE HONOUR OF COMMUNICATING THEM I AM WITH THE MOST RESPECTFUL ATTACHMENT S I R YOUR MOST HUMBLE AND MOST OBEDIENT SERVANT GUILL MAZEAS S I R539 S I R ST GERMAIN JUNE 29 1752 READ NOV 23 ON THE 26 OF THIS MONTH WE HAD A 1752 STORM AT TWO DIFFERENT TIMES THE FIRST WAS AT 3 IN THE AFTERNOON AND THE SECOND AT HALF AN HOUR AFTER 6 THIS STORM WHICH CAME FROM THE SOUTHWEST WAS VERY INCONSIDERABLE THERE WERE BUT TWO OR THREE CLAPS OF THUNDER EITHER AT 3 OR AT 6 O CLOCK AND THERE WAS A CONSIDERABLE INTERVAL BETWEEN THE LIGHTNING AND THE CLAP WHICH SHEWD THAT THE THUN DER WAS AT A GREAT DISTANCE NEVERTHELESS THE EFFECTS OF THE ELECTRICITY WERE VERY VIOLENT WHICH I ATTRIBUTE TO M LE MONNIERS INGENIOUS APPARATUS WHICH IS AS FOLLOWS IT IS CERTAIN BY M MUSCHENBROEKS EXPERIMENTS THAT THE MORE SURFACE THE ELECTRISED BARS HAVE THE COMMOTIONS ARE THE MORE VIOLENT BUT AS IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO FASTEN RODS OR BARS OF A CERTAIN SIZE TO THE ENDS OF THE GREAT WOODEN POLES M LE MONNIER HAS INGENIOUSLY SUPPLIED THAT DEFECT IN FORMING A MAGA ZINE FOR THE ELECTRICITY THIS MAGAZINE IS ONLY A COM MUNICATION OF THE ELECTRICITY WHICH DESCENDS FROM THE BAR OF IRON SITUATED AT THE TOP OF THE POLE WITH SEVE RAL OTHER LARGE BARS OF IRON PLACED NEAR THE POLE THE GREATER THE QUANTITY OF THESE BARS THE GREATER IS THE QUANTITY OF ELECTRICITY FURNISHD BY THE MAGAZINE IN THE LAST EXPERIMENT WE HAD A TIN PIPE OF 7 FEET LONG AND ABOUT 5 INCHES DIAMETER IT WAS THE FIRST MAGAZINE THE SECOND CONSISTED OF SIX GREAT BARS OF IRON OF SIX FEET LONG EACH PLACED IN PARALLEL ORDER UPON GLASS BOTTLES ALL THESE MAGAZINES COMMUNI CATED WITH THE IRON WIRE THAT DESCENDED FROM THE LIT TLE BAR AT THE TOP OF THE GREAT POLE WHICH I DESCRIBED IN MY LAST LETTER Y Y Y 2 THE540 THE 26 OF THIS MONTH AT 3 AFTERNOON VERY LIVELY SPARKS WERE EXCITED AND M LE MONNIER SET FIRE TO SPIRITS OF WINE AT 6 O CLOCK I WENT UP TO A PROPER PLACE IN ORDER STRICTLY TO OBSERVE THE INTERVALS BE TWEEN THE COMMOTIONS AND THE ELECTRICITY THE CLOUDS EXTENDED FROM THE SOUTH AND WEST TO THE ZENITH OF THE POLE AND THE LIGHTNING CAME FROM A VERY DISTANT PART AND IN PROPORTION AS THE CLOUDS CAME NEARER THE ELECTRICITY WAS FELT WITH VERY SMART SHOCKS BUT WITHOUT LIGHT OR REGULARITY FOR SOME TIMES NONE WERE FELT FOR TWO OR THREE MINUTES AND IT WAS COMMONLY WITH EVERY FLASH OF LIGHTNING THAT THE COMMOTION WAS FELT BUT WHEN THE CLOUDS HAD COVERD A CONSIDERABLE PART OF THE HEAVENS THE COM MOTIONS OF THE ELECTRICITY SUCCEEDED VERY QUICKLY WITH NOISE AND SPARKS ALTHO THE THUNDER COULD SCARCE BE HEARD BECAUSE OF ITS DISTANCE IT MAY FROM HENCE BE JUDGED HOW STRONG THE COMMOTIONS WOULD BE IF THE CLOUDS WHICH PRODUCED THE THUNDER WERE NEARER THE BAR ON THE 29 OF JUNE WE HAD ANOTHER STORM BUT I WAS NOT PRESENT AT THE EXPERIMENTS MADE IN THE GAR DEN BEING MYSELF EMPLOYD IN A LIKE EXPERIMENT IN MY CHAMBER I PLACED AT MY WINDOW WHICH WAS ABOUT 35 FEET FROM THE GROUND A BAR OF IRON OF 12 FEET LONG WHICH RECEIVD A VERY SHARP IRON WIRE OF SIX FEET HIGH THE WHOLE ADVANCED INTO THE STREET BY MEANS OF A WOODEN POLE LAID PARALLEL TO THE HORI ZON AT THE END OF WHICH WAS A GLASS TUBE FILLD WITH RESIN IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THE IRON ROD THE WIRE THAT HUNG FROM THE EXTREMITY OF THE POLE ENTERD INTO MY CHAMBER AND FROM THENCE INTO A GALLERY OF 30 FEET LONG THE ELECTRICAL MAGAZINE WAS IN MY CHAMBER541 CHAMBER AND THE IRON WIRE AFTER SEVERAL TURNINGS WAS AGAIN BROUGHT THITHER I HAD DISPOSED OF THIS WIRE IN SUCH A MANNER THAT IF THE STORM SHOULD COME IN THE NIGHT OR IF IT HAPPEND BY DAY I HAD IT IN MY POWER TO OBSERVE ALL I PROPOSED WITHOUT QUITTING MY BED ON THE ONE HAND OR LEAVING MY BUSINESS ON THE OTHER THE STORM CAME AT 5 IN THE EVENING AND ALTHOUGH I HAD NOT YET TIME ENOUGH TO FORM A SUFFICIENT MA GAZINE OF ELECTRICITY I HAD NEVERTHELESS VERY SATISFAC TORY SIGNS THE PERSON WHO HELD THE IRON WIRE FELT A COMMOTION AND AT THE SAME INSTANT SILKEN RI BANDS WERE ATTRACTED BY THE ELECTRICAL MAGAZINE THERE CAME ON A GREAT SHOWER OF RAIN AND HAIL WHICH WETTED THE RESIN IN THE GLASS TUBE THAT SUP PORTED MY BAR AND AFTER THAT I HAD NO MORE SIGNS OF ELECTRICITY THE SAME THING HAPPEND IN THE GARDEN WHERE THE SILKEN CORDS WHICH IN SEVERAL PLACES INTERRUPTED THE COMMUNICATION OF THE ELECTRISED BODIES WITH THE NONELECTRICS HAVING BEEN WET SENSIBLY DIMINISHED THE DESIRED EFFECT THE ELECTRICITY HOWEVER WAS VERY STRONG BEFORE THE RAIN FELL AND THE COMMO TIONS WERE FELT AT ABOUT A FOOT DISTANCE BUT THE STORM ONLY PASSED BY AND LASTED NO MORE IN THE WHOLE THAN TWO OR THREE MINUTES HENCE SIR IT FOLLOWS THAT THE ELECTRICAL MAGA ZINE IS AN IMPORTANT OBJECT IN EXPERIMENTS OF THIS KIND I DO NOT EVEN DOUBT BUT THAT BY PLACING GUNS AND BARS OF IRON IN GREAT NUMBERS IN PLACES ADJACENT TO THE WOODEN POLE WE MIGHT EVEN COME TO KILL ANIMALS AND VERIFY ALL THE SURPRISING PHAENO MENA THAT THUNDER HAS PRODUCED FOR SO MANY AGES THIS542 THIS MAY BE DONE WITHOUT GOING OUT OF ONES ROOM AND EVEN IN BED WHERE ONE MIGHT EASILY BE ASSURED OF THE DEGREE OF THE FORCE OF A STORM BY THE DEGREE OF THE STRENGTH OF THE COMMOTIONS AND IF WE WERE LOTH TO TOUCH THE IRON WIRE WITH A FINGER FOR FEAR OF THE PAIN WE MIGHT USE A LITTLE PLATE OR BLADE OF TIN FASTENED TO THE END OF A GLASS TUBE ONE MIGHT BY THIS MEANS HAVE THE SATISFACTION OF JUDG ING OF THE DEGREE OF THE STRENGTH OF THUNDER I FORGOT TO OBSERVE THAT MY IRON BAR WAS TOO NEAR THE NEIGHBOURING HOUSES WHICH GREATLY LESSEND THE ELECTRICAL POWER I BEG SIR YOU WILL IN MY NAME ASSURE THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF THE SENTIMENTS OF RESPECT AND AC KNOWLEGMENT WHICH I OWE IT FOR THE HONOUR IT HAS DONE ME I ALSO REPEAT THEM TO YOU SIR AND TO MESSIEURS WILSON PRINGLE AND KNIGHT AND AM S I R C GUILL MAZEAS S I R ST GERMAIN JULY 12 1752 ON THE FIRST SECOND AND TENTH OF JULY WE HAD STORMS AT ST GER MAIN OF WHICH I HAVE THE HONOUR TO GIVE YOU AN ACCOUNT READ NOV 23 1752 I WAS NOT A WITNESS TO THE EXPERIMENTS THAT WERE MADE ON THE FIRST AND SECOND OF THIS MONTH IN THE GARDEN OF THE HOTEL DE NOAILLES BECAUSE I WAS THEN BUSY IN MY CHAMBER WHICH I SHAIL MENTION BY ANDBY BUT THE FOLLOWING IS WHAT WAS TOLD ME AND 3543 AND SINCE CONFIRMD BY MR LE MONNIER WHO PER FORMD THEM HIMSELF 1 HE WAS CONVINCED THAT THE HIGH SITUATION IN WHICH THE BAR OF IRON WAS COMMONLY PLACED IS NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO PRODUCE THE EFFECTS OF ELECTRICITY FOR A TIN SPEAKING TRUMPET SUSPENDED UPON SILKEN CORDS ABOUT FIVE OR SIX FEET FROM THE GROUND HAS PRODUCED VERY PARTICULAR SIGNS OF ELECTRICITY 2 A MAN PLACED UPON A CAKE OF RESIN AND HOLD ING WITH HIS HAND A WOODEN POLE OF ABOUT 18 FEET LONG ROUND WHICH AN IRON WIRE WAS TWISTED WAS SO WELL ELECTRISED WHILE IT THUNDERD THAT SPARKS WHICH WERE VERY LIVELY WERE DRAWN FROM HIS FACE AND HANDS 3 HAVING TAKEN AWAY THE COMMUNICATION OF THE ELECTRICAL MAGAZINE WITH THE IRON WIRE WHICH HUNG FROM THE GREAT WOODEN POLE THIS MAGAZINE CON SISTED AS I HAVE SAID IN MY LAST LETTER OF 6 GREAT BARS OF IRON PLACED HORIZONTALLY UPON GLASS BOTTLES ABOUT 4 FEET FROM THE GROUND I SAY THIS MAGAZINE WAS STRONGLY ELECTRISED WHEN THE STORMY CLOUD PASSED IN THE ZENITH 4 A MAN STANDING UPON THE ELECTRICAL CAKE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GARDEN AND SIMPLY HOLDING UP ONE OF HIS HANDS IN THE AIR ATTRACTED WITH THE OTHER HAND WOODSHAVINGS WHICH WERE HELD TO HIM UPON A PIECE OF LEAD WHENCE IT EVIDENTLY FOLLOWS THAT THE MATTER WHICH IS THE CAUSE OF ALL THE SURPRISING PHAENOMENA WHICH ELECTRICITY AFFORDS US FILLS THE AT MOSPHERE IN THE TIME OF A STORM THAT IT PENETRATES US THAT WE BREATHE IT WITH THE AIR AND THAT THE HEIGHT USUALLY GIVEN TO THE IRON BAR ONLY SERVES TO IN TERCEPT THE FAR GREATER QUANTITY OF THE ELECTRICAL MATTER AT544 AT THE TIME THAT MR LE MONNIER MADE HIS EXPE MENTS I IN MY TURN TRIED TO PERFECT THE MANNER OF BRINGING THE ELECTRICITY INTO MY CHAMBER THIS METHOD SEEMD TO ME THE MORE ESSENTIAL AS THE GLASS TUBES WHICH MR LE MONNIER SUBSTITUTED TO THE ELECTRICAL CAKES HAVE NOT THE ADVANTAGE OF KEEPING THE ELECTRICITY IN THE IRON BAR WHEN A GOOD DEAL OF RAIN FALLS WHEN THESE TUBES ARE TOO WET THE ELECTRICITY CEASES I THEREFORE INCREASED THE LENGTH OF MY WOODEN POLE WHICH WENT OUT OF MY WINDOW AND AT THE SAME TIME THAT OF MY IRON ROD WHICH WAS PERPEN CULARLY FASTENED TO ITS END THE GREATER THE LENGTH AND HEIGHT OF THESE TWO WERE THE STRONGER WAS THE ELECTRICITY IN MY CHAMBER WHICH LED ME TO THE TWO FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS 1 MY CHAMBER HAVING TWO WINDOWS OPPOSITE TO EACH OTHER THE ONE TO THE SOUTH LOOKING INTO A STREET AND OVERAGAINST THE NEIGHBOURING HOUSES THE OTHER TO THE NORTH WITH AN UNBOUNDED PROSPECT OF THE COUNTRY I FOUND THE ELECTRICITY WAS STRONGER WHEN MY POLE WAS SUPPORTED BY THE RESIN CAKE PLACED UPON THE NORTH WINDOW THAN IN THE OTHER OPPOSITE TO THE HOUSES WHICH MADE ME IMAGINE THAT THE ELECTRICAL MATTER WAS MORE STRONGLY ATTRACTED BY THE NEIGHBOUR ING LARGE BUILDINGS THAN BY MY POLE 2 I OBSERVED A CONSIDERABLE DIMINUTION OF THE ELECTRICITY WHEN RAIN CAME ON ALTHO THE THUNDER ROARD VERY STRONGLY AND THE CAKE OF RESIN ON MY WINDOW WAS NOT WET WHICH MADE ME THINK THE RAIN AS IT FELL MIGHT DEPRIVE THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE ELECTRICAL MATTER WHEN IT IS IN A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY TO CARRY AWAY WITH IT A LARGE PORTION OF THAT MATTER HERE545 HERE IS A FACT WHICH ESTABLISHES THAT OPINION WHEN THE RAIN CEASED FOR SOME TIME MY POLE ALTHO WET PRODUCED NEW SIGNS OF ELECTRICITY HITHERTO THE ELECTRICITY APPEARD TO ME TO BE STRONG ER IN THE BEGINNING THAN IN THE MIDDLE OR END OF A STORM THAT IS IN PROPORTION AS IT APPROACHD TILL IT WAS IMMEDIATELY OVER THE POLE I DRAW THIS FACT FROM THE OBSERVATIONS WHICH I MADE FROM THE FIRST AND SECOND OF JULY WITHOUT GIV ING IT AS A GENERAL ONE HOWEVER I NOW REASSUME THE EXPERIMENT OF THE 20 OF THE SAME MONTH TOWARDS 11 IN THE MORNING THE HEAVENS BEGAN TO BE COVERD TO THE SOUTHWEST WITH SOME CLAPS OF THUN DER AND LIGHTNING AT A GREAT DISTANCE I HAD JUST TIME TO GO TO THE GARDEN WHERE I FOUND THE DUKE DAYEN WHO HAD PREPARED EVERY THING FOR THE EXPERIMENTS AN IRON WIRE DESCENDED FROM THE TOP OF THE POLE AND RESTED UPON THE HOTHOUSE OF THE GARDEN THIS WIRE WAS SUPPORTED BY A SILKEN CORD AND WAS TERMI NATED BY A TIN CYLINDER OF ABOUT 3 INCHES DIAMETER AND 3 FEET LONG THE ELECTRICITY OF THIS CYLINDER WAS SUCH THAT WHEN A FINGER APPROACHD IT TWO OR THREE VERY LIVELY SPARKS AT A TIME WERE PRODUCED WITH A SPARKLING NOISE LIKE THAT OF THE NAILS OF ONES FINGERS CRACKLED AGAINST EACH OTHER THEN THE DUKE DAYEN TOOK THE FIRST SHRUB HE MET IN THE HOTHOUSE WHICH HAPPENED TO BE THAT FROM WHICH THE LABDANUM IS PRODUCED AS WELL AS I CAN REMEMBER HE PLACED IT WITH ITS POT ON A CAKE OF RESIN AND FASTENED THE IRON WIRE TO ONE OF ITS BRANCHES THIS SHRUB WAS INSTANTLY ELECTRISED SO THAT WHITISH SPARKS ISSUED FROM EVERY LEAF WITH THE SAME KIND OF CRACKLING I HAVE JUST MENTIOND BUT Z Z Z THE546 THE TRUNK OF THIS SHRUB HAD A MUCH STRONGER ELECTRI CITY WHETHER AT THAT INSTANT THE ELECTRICITY OF THE CLOUD WAS MORE STRONG FOR IT VARIES EVERY MOMENT OR THAT THE FORCE OF THE WHOLE ELECTRICITY EXPANDED THRO THE LEAVES BECAME CONCENTRATED IN THE TRUNK OF THIS SHRUB  THE DUKE THEN TOOK ONE OF HIS SILVER WATERING POTS WHICH WAS TWO FEET AND AN HALF HIGH HE FILLD IT WITH WATER WITHIN AN INCH OF THE BRIM AND PLACED IT UPON THE ELECTRICAL CAKE DIPPING INTO IT A WIRE OF LEAD WHICH COMMUNICATED WITH THAT WIRE WHICH CAME FROM THE TOP OF THE POLE OF ALL THE ELECTRICITY TRIED TILL THEN THIS WAS INCOMPARABLY THE STRONGEST NOR DID I SEE ANY SPARKS WHEN I ADVANCED MY FINGER TOWARDS IT BUT THE SHOCK AFFECTED ME IN THE ARMS AND BREAST WITH SUCH VIOLENCE THAT I DID NOT ATTEMPT TO MAKE A SECOND TRIAL WHEREFORE IT WOULD BE WELL BE FORE ONE RUNS THE HAZARD OF SUCH SORT OF EXPERIMENTS TO TRY THE FORCE OF THE ELECTRICITY BY APPLYING AN IRON WIRE OR A PIECE OF STEEL FASTENED TO A LITTLE GLASS TUBE DURING THESE EXPERIMENTS M LE MONNIER WAS ABSENT WHICH DEPRIVED US OF SOME NEW DESIGNS WHICH HE HAD RESOLVD TO PUT IN PRACTICE I AM SIR INFERREDINFERREDC G MAZEAS  THIS EXPERIMENT WAS MADE THE 2 OF JULY BY M LE MONNIER AND REPEATED AS I HAVE NOW MENTIOND IT ON THE 11 OF THE SAME MONTH S I R547 S I R PARIS AUG 21 1752 A PHAENOMENON WHICH I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT WORTHY OF STRICT OBSERVA TION IS THE DIMINUTION OF THE ELECTRICITY OF THUNDER WHEN RAIN COMES ON DURING THE STORM THIS DIMI NUTION WAS REMARKED AT ST GERMAIN EVERY TIME I WAS A WITNESS TO M LE MONNIERS EXPERIMENTS AND THE SAME EFFECT IS WITHIN THIS LITTLE WHILE CONFIRMD TO ME BY THE LEARNED MR EULER IN COMMUNICATING TO ME THE OBSERVATIONS OF M LUDOLF I HAVE THOUGHT OF ONLY THREE CAUSES ASSIGNABLE TO THIS PHAENOMENON WHICH I LAY DOWN IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER READ NOV 23 1752 1 DOES NOT THIS DIMINUTION HAPPEN BECAUSE THE DROPS OF WATER THAT RUN DOWN THE LITTLE BAR OF IRON CARRY WITH THEM THE ELECTRICITY OF THE BAR 2 DOES NOT THE RAIN IN PASSING THRO THE ATMO SPHERE DEPRIVE OR STRIP IT OF THE ELECTRICITY WHICH IS COMMUNICATED TO IT BY THE THUNDER 3 OR ELSE IS IT NOT MORE LIKELY THAT THE DIMINU TION AND THE TOTAL CESSATION OF THE ELECTRICAL STREAMS HAPPEN THEN EITHER BECAUSE THE MATTER OF THE THUN DER IS EXHAUSTED OR BECAUSE THE CLOUDS COMING TO DISSOLVE THE ELECTRICAL MATTER IS LOST AND DISSIPATED I LEFT ST GERMAIN THE 12 OF JULY TO COME TO PARIS AT 7 IN THE EVENING AT THE INSTANT OF MY ARRIVAL I SAW THE HEAVENS COVERD WITH CLOUDS AND THE LIGHT NING FOREBODED THUNDER WHICH WAS SOON HEARD I WENT UP INTO THE GALLERY OF THE HOTEL DE NOAILLES WHICH IS VERY HIGH AND DISTANT FROM THE NEIGHBOUR ING BUILDINGS MY POLE WAS 10 FEET HIGH AT THE END OF WHICH A GLASS TUBE WAS MADE FAST AND TO THIS A VERY SHARP IRON SPIRE FROM THE MIDDLE OF WHICH A Z Z Z 2 WIRE548 WIRE OF ABOUT 20 FEET LONG CAME DOWN AND RESTED UPON A LONG GLASS TUBE FIXED TO THE BALUSTRADE WHICH ENVIROND THE GALLERY MY APPARATUS WAS SCARCE READY WHEN IT THUNDERD AND THE CLOUDS BROKE BY THIS FIRST CLAP AND POURD DOWN A CONTINUAL LARGE QUANTITY OF RAIN WHICH LASTED NEAR 2 HOURS WITHOUT THE LEAST DIS CONTINUANCE OF THE THUNDER I FELT NO COMMOTION IN PUTTING MY FINGER TOWARDS THE WIRE NOR COULD I DRAW ANY SPARKS FROM IT I WAS UPON THE POINT OF GIVING IT OVER WHEN THE WIRE HAP PEND TO TOUCH THE LEADS AND THE BALUSTRADE OF THE GALLERY AND IT INSTANTLY PRODUCED AS MANY SPARKS AS IT TOUCHD PLACES ON THE BALUSTRADE AND LEADS I THEN TOOK THE WIRE IN MY HAND AND THREW IT STRONGLY AGAINST THE BARS OF IRON AND AS THE WIRE EXTENDED AND SUCCESSIVELY TOUCHD THE BARS IT ALWAYS PRODUCED THE SAME EFFECT THERE WERE PRODIGIOUS MULTITUDES OF THESE SHINING SPARKS LIKE THOSE PRODUCED BY THE FINGER IN COMMON EXPERIMENTS I ONLY WANTED AN ELECTRICAL MAGAZINE TO ACCUMULATE ELECTRICAL MATTER IN WHICH WOULD HAVE PRODUCED ME ALL THE USUAL PHAENOMENA THE THUNDER WAS IN ITS GREATEST VIGOUR FROM HALF AN HOUR AFTER 8 TO HALF AN HOUR AFTER 9 DURING WHICH THE RAIN WAS MOST ABUNDANT AND I RE PEATED MY EXPERIMENT AT SEVERAL TIMES IT IS THEREFORE CERTAIN 1 THAT THE ELECTRICITY SOME TIMES CEASES WHEN IT RAINS BUT NOT ALWAYS BECAUSE IN THE PRESENT CASE THE WIRE WAS AS MUCH IMPREG NATED WITH THE ELECTRICAL STREAMS AS IT COULD BE 2 THAT THE FIRST AND SECOND QUESTION PROPOSED ABOVE DO NOT INCLUDE THE TRUE CAUSE OF THE CESSATION OF THE ELECTRICITY AT THE TIME OF RAIN SINCE THERE ARE FEW STORMS IN WHICH THE RAIN IS MORE ABUNDANT THAN549 THAN THIS WHICH FELL THE 12 OF JULY IN THE EVENING AND WHEREIN MY APPARATUS WAS AS WET AS IT COULD BE 3 IT IS AGAIN CERTAIN BY MR LUDOLFS THIRD EXPE RIMENT MENTIOND HEREAFTER THAT THIS CESSATION DOES NOT HAPPEN BECAUSE THE MATTER OF THE THUNDER IS EX TINCT  WHEN THE RAIN WAS ABUNDANT SAYS HE WE  REMARKD NOTHING OF THIS FORCE OF ELECTRICITY ALTHO  THE LIGHTNING AND THE CLAPS OF THUNDER WERE EX  CEEDING STRONG THE TRUE CAUSE OF THESE KIND OF DIMINUTIONS MAY THEREFORE DEPEND ON SOME OTHER PRINCIPLES WHICH WE HAVE NOT AS YET COME TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF HI THERTO THIS PHAENOMENON PRESENTS US WITH A GREAT MA NY VARIATIONS I HAVE SEEN CIRCUMSTANCES WHEREIN SIMPLE CLOUDS WITHOUT THUNDER OR LIGHTNING PRO DUCED MORE ELECTRICITY THAN WHEN THERE WAS LOUD THUNDER I HAVE SEEN OTHERS WHEREIN THE ELECTRICITY DID NOT SHEW ITSELF BUT WHERE THERE WAS LIGHTNING AND IN SHORT OTHERS WHEN THE ELECTRICITY WHICH SEEMD DISSIPATED DURING THE RAIN BEGAN AGAIN AS SOON AS THE RAIN CEASED ALTHO THE THUNDER WAS VERY DI STANT THE FEW EXPERIMENTS HITHERTO MADE ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO PRONOUNCE ANY CERTAIN OPINION UPON WITH SO MANY VARIATIONS THE LITTLE SUCCESS I HAVE HAD IN TRYING WHETHER STRONG EXPLOSIONS OR VIOLENT FERMENTATIONS OF SALTS SULPHURS AND SEVERAL LIQUORS WOULD NOT PRODUCE SOME SIGNS OF ELECTRICITY DOES NOT SURPRIZE ME THE MATTER CONTAINED IN CLOUDS MAY BE OF A DIFFERENT NA TURE THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE EARTH IS A MORE POW ERFUL SUBLIMATOR THAN THOSE OF OUR CHEMISTS AND OUR WEAK OPERATIONS WILL NEVER PERFECTLY COME UP TO THOSE OF NATURE IT550 IT REMAINS SIR THAT I COMMUNICATE TO YOU THE OBSERVATIONS THAT MR LUDOLF MADE AT BERLIN I PRE SENT YOU WITH THEM AS MR EULER WAS SO KIND TO SEND THEM WHICH I HAVE TRANSCRIBED WORD FOR WORD  AS I WAS NOT PRESENT SAYS THIS LEARNED MAN AT  THE EXPERIMENTS MADE UPON THUNDER I WILL HAVE  THE HONOUR TO TRANSCRIBE FOR YOU THE RECITAL THAT  MR LUDOLF COMMUNICATED TO ME THE EXPERI  MENTS WERE MADE THE 19 AND 26 OF JULY AND THE  1 AND 2 OF AUGUST AND IT IS OBSERVED 1 THAT THE SPARKS DRAWN FROM THE WIRE WERE HALF AN INCH LONG AND THEY CAUSED SO HORRIBLE A SHOCK THAT THE INTIRE BODY OF THE PERSON WHO ATTRACTED THEM WAS SHAKEN BUT THE SMALL SPARKS PRODUCED ONLY A LIGHT SENSATION IN THE FINGERS 2 IT IS ALSO REMARKD THAT THIS ELECTRICITY COM MUNICATES ITSELF TO ALL BODIES ELSEWHERE THAT ARE SUS CEPTIBLE OF IT PROVIDED THEY ARE PLACED UPON ELECTRI CAL BODIES WHILE THEY ARE MADE TO COMMUNICATE BY A WIRE 3 WHEN THERE WAS PLENTY OF RAIN WE SCARCE RE MARKED ANY THING OF THE FORCE OF THE ELECTRICITY AL THO THE LIGHTNING AND CLAPS OF THUNDER WERE VERY STRONG 4 AT EVERY CLAP OF THUNDER THE ELECTRICITY SEEMD EXTINCT AND RETURNED NOT TILL AFTER 30 SECONDS OR THEREABOUT AND SOMETIMES LONGER 5 WHEN THE WIRE WAS SURROUNDED WITH DROPS OF RAIN IT WAS OBSERVD THAT ONLY SOME OF THEM WERE ELECTRICAL WHICH WAS REMARKABLE BY THE CONIC FIGURE THEY HAD WHILST THE OTHERS REMAIND ROUND AS BE FORE IT WAS ALSO PERCEIVED THAT THE ELECTRICAL AND NONELECTRICAL DROPS SUCCEEDED ALMOST ALTERNATELY WHICH 5551 WHICH MADE US CALL TO MIND A VERY SINGULAR PHAENO MENON WHICH HAPPEND SOME YEARS AGO TO FIVE PEA SANTS WHO PASSED THRO A CORNFIELD NEAR FRANCFORT UPON THE ODER IN A STORM THE THUNDER KILLD THE FIRST THE THIRD AND THE FIFTH WITHOUT INJURING THE SECOND AND FOURTH 6 THE STORM OF THE FIRST OF AUGUST WAS VERY CON SIDERABLE WITH VERY GREAT RAIN EVERY MINUTE WE RE MARKED 3 OR MORE FLASHES OF LIGHTNING IN THE MEAN TIME SOME ELECTRICAL SPARKS WERE OBSERVD UPON THE WIRE THEY PUT UPON A CHAIN WHICH COMMUNICATED WITH THE WIRE A THREAD THE TWO ENDS OF WHICH HUNG DOWN WHICH SHEWD ELECTRICITY BY MUTUALLY REPEL LING EACH OTHER FOR AT EVERY FLASH OF LIGHTNING THEY APPROACHED OTHER SUDDENLY AS IF THEY HAD BEEN PUSHD ONE AGAINST THE OTHER BY SOME FORCE 7 SOMETIMES THE ELECTRICITY CONTINUED IN THE WIRE WITH GREAT STRENGTH TO 45 MINUTES AFTER THE THUNDER AND LIGHTNING HAD INTIRELY CEASED C CONFORMABLE TO THE 6 OBSERVATION OF MR LUDOLF I HAVE OFTEN OBSERVED THAT IN PRESENTING DUST OR DRYD SNUFF TO THE END OF A TIN CYLINDER WHICH HUNG TO THE WIRE IN THESE SORT OF EXPERIMENTS THIS DUST WAS STRONGLY ATTRACTED AS SOON AS THE WIRE SHEWD ANY SIGNS OF ELECTRICITY BUT WHEN THE ELECTRICAL MATTER CAME TO BE ACCUMULATED IN THIS CYLINDER THE DUST WAS POWERFULLY REPELLD AS BY A STRONG BLAST INSOMUCH THAT THE QUANTITY OF MOLECULES REPELLD WAS MUCH GREATER THAN OF THOSE ATTRACTED AT THE SAME TIME AND WITH RESPECT TO THIS SUCCESSIVE ATTRACTION AND REPULSION I MUST NOT INFERREDPASSINFERRED BY IN SILENCE AN EXPERIMENT I WAS552 I WAS INFORMED OF WITHOUT KNOWING THE AUTHOR OF IT  THE DISHES OF A PAIR OF SCALES WERE SUSPENDED TO THE BALANCE BY SILKEN CORDS THE TWO DISHES WERE ELEC TRISED AND A VERY SHARP NEEDLE WAS PRESENTED TO ONE OF THEM THE SCALES IMMEDIATELY LOST THEIR EQUILI BRIUM AND THAT DISH UNDER WHICH THE NEEDLE WAS HELD WAS ATTRACTED THE DIRECT CONTRARY HAPPEND WHEN AN OBTUSE OR ROUND BODY SUCH AS A LEADEN BULLET WAS PUT UPON THE POINT OF THE NEEDLE FOR THEN THE DISH WAS REPELLD IF THIS EXPERIMENT BE TRUE AS I HAVE ALL THE REASON IN THE WORLD TO BELIEVE IT SO IT STRONGLY IMITATES WHAT HAPPENS IN THE CLOUDS WHEN THEY ARE IN AEQUILIBRIO IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND IT GIVES US ROOM TO CONJEC TURE THAT IT WOULD BE MUCH LESS DANGEROUS TO TERMI NATE THE TOPS OF STEEPLES WITH OBTUSE BODIES THAN WITH POINTED SPIRES UPON WHICH THE THUNDER FALLS SOONER OR LATER WHEN THEY ARE VERY HIGH AS THE YEAR BEGINS TO DRAW TO AN END I BELIEVE THESE OBSERVATIONS WILL BE THE LAST FOR THE YEAR 1752 AN EPOCHA WHICH WILL ALWAYS BE FAMOUS WITH THE LOVERS OF ELECTRICITY AND PARTICULARLY MYSELF BE CAUSE IT HAS GIVEN ME AN OPPORTUNITY OF TESTIFYING FROM TIME TO TIME THE RESPECT I HAVE FOR YOUR PER SON AND THE ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I OWE TO THAT FRIEND SHIP WITH WHICH WHICH YOU HONOUR YOUR MOST HUMBLE C G MAZEAS  SINCE I WROTE TO DR HALES I FOUND THIS EXPERIMENT AMONG THOSE OF MR FRANKLIN XCII

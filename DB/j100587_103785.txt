concerning the Figure of the Earth was read before the Royal Society I met with a Differtation of Mons Mairan in the Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Paris for the Year 1720 wherein the learned and ingenious Author has taken a great deal of Pains to reconcile the Observations made on Pendulums found to be shorter at the AEquator than at Paris when they swing Seconds with the oblong spheroidical Figure of the Earth deduced from Mons Cassinis Measures And tho upon a strict Examination of his Conjectures and what he gives for Demonstra tions I do not find Reason to alter my Opinion con cerning the oblate or flatted Spheroid which Sir Isaac Newton has shewn to be the Figure of the Earth yet since it might be thought by some who have read Mons Mairans Treatise and afterwards may read mine that I have not considerd all the Circumstances that He has done and that I have not been exact enough in the Ma thematical Part of my Dissertation because I have drawn some Conclusions from supposing the Figure of the Earth spherical when I should have supposd it an oblong Spheroid I beg Leave to shew here wherein I think Mons Mairan is mistaken and to give those additional Proofs of my Assertions which I promisd the Society when I gave in my last Paper  Vid Philos Trans No 386 387 V O L XXXIII R r First278 First then I begin with the Conjectures Mons Mairan says that it is as reasonable to suppose the Earth if it was once fluid to have been an oblong Spheroid at first as a Sphere and that in such a Case the Centrifugal Force of the several Parts of the Earth arising from its Revolution about its Axis which might convert a Sphere into an oblate Spheroid woud only change an oblong Spheroid into one less oblong If the Earth was at first a Fluid supposed ho mogeneous and of any given Form and left to those Laws which we find to obtain at present it must put on a spherical Figure for the same Reason that Drops of Mercury of Water and other Fluids put on such a Figure And to suppose any Change made in that Figure from the Pressure of an external Fluid filling up all Space is contrary to what has been demonstrated by Sir Isaac Newton in his Principia Lib 2 Prop 19 where he shews That if any Portion of a Fluid be compressd by the same or any other homogeneous Fluid that Portion will not have its Figure alterd by that Pressure And indeed we see that in the Receiver of the Air Pump Lumps of Butter coagulated Oil or Honey Drops of quicksilver or Water c have the same Fi gure whether the Pressure of the Air acts upon them or be taken off by exhausting the Receiver That a fluid Substance of any Figure will by the Gravity of its Parts become spherical is plain by the fol lowing D E M O N S T R A T I O N Fig I Let A B C D E be a Portion of an homogeneous Fluid whose Parts tend towards one anotherand whose Figure is279 is not spherical If in such a Fluid we suppose a Syphon as A C E or which is the same thing if all the Fluid shoud be frozen except the Canal A C E whose Legs A C and C E are unequal and meet at C the Center of the Fluid towards which there is the greatest Tendency the Fluid will run out at A in the Leg A C till it be come down as far as g in the Leg C E supposing C g equal to A C But if the Leg A C be lengthened as far as c then the Fluid will only come down as far as e in the Leg C E and at the same time rise up to a in the Leg C a C a being equal to C e If such another Canal or Syphon be supposd at BCD the Fluid in it will come down from D to d and rise from B to b And since such Syphons may be supposd all over the Fluid A B D E that Fluid by the mutual Tendency of its Parts towards one another must be reducd to the spherical Figure a b d e Which was to be demonstrated Now without considering the Unreasonableness of the Supposition let us imagine the Earth to have been an oblong Spheroid at first and then to have a diurnal Revolution given to it which shoud by Degrees shorten its Axis to bring it to what Messieurs Cassini and Mairan suppose it at present to be If in such a Case the Earth be supposd fluid enough to change its Figure by the Revolution about its Axis why should it stop when the AEquatorial Diameter comes to want just one 96th Part of the Length of the Axis since two Powers act upon it to shorten its Axis viz Gravity and the Centrifugal Force the first of which has already been shewn capable to reduce it to a Sphere and the Centri fugal Force is acknowledged by Mons Mairan to be as Sir Isaac Newton has provd it at the AEquator equal to 1289 Part of the Gravity there Certainly the Alteration of Figure woud not have stoppd before the R r 2 Earth280 Earth came to be a Sphere nay and it must have ri sen at the AEquator and how much I have already shewn in my former Paper Again if we suppose the Earth of an heterogeneous Fluid before the diurnal Revolution the heaviest Parts woud go towards the Center and the lighter towards the Surface and that Way the Terraqueous Globe woud also become a Sphere Then if when the Cen tral Parts are fixd and the superficial Strata are still fluid the Earth receives a diurnal Motion it will rise at the AEquatorial Parts and that to a greater Height than what I have shewn in my former Paper where I supposd the Earth of uniform Matter And that some thing like this must be the Case appears from what Sir Isaac Newton has said upon this Subject For after having shewn from supposing the Earth of uniform Mat ter that the Centrifugal Force of all its Parts woud bring it to be 1716 English Miles higher at the AEquator than at the Poles and after having given a Table of the proportionable Decrease of the Length of the Degrees of a Meridian of the Earth going from the Poles to the AEquator in such a Figure of the Earth with the Lengths that Pendulums must have to swing Seconds in several Latitudes from a Comparison of the Lengths of Pendulums observd by different Persons to be shorter towards the AEquator than in greater Latitudes when they swing Seconds he shews that the Earth must be 31712 Miles higher at the AEquator than at the Poles and therefore that it must be denser towards the Central than the Superficial Parts to produce a flatted Spheroid where the AEquatorial Diameter must exceed the Axis so much more that is be longer something more than 1125 Part Lastly let us suppose the Earth at its first Creation to have been made of Land and Water the first as solid and281 and the last as fluid as it is now but of Mons Cassinis Figure and examine the Consequence Since in that Figure the Axis is 196 Part longer than the AEquatorial Diameter the Gravity will be so much greater at the AEquator than at the Poles that the Waters will all flow to the AEquatorial and leave the Polar Regions which will happen still more by the Centrifugal Force which the Earth in its diurnal Motion will give to the Fluid and therefore the Sea woud be 4385100 Miles rekoning 5000 Feet to a Mile higher at the AEquator than at the Poles which must overflow all the Torrid Zone and leave the Polar Regions dry I am very well aware that it may be objected by such as have read Mons Mairans Dissertation and have not read Sir Isaac Newtons Principia or have not read that Book with due Attention   That I have not ar  gued fairly in drawing Consequences from a greater  Gravity at the AEquator than at the Poles in an ob  long Spheroid because Mons Mairan has shewn  thatin such a Figure of the Earththe Gravity is greater  at the Poles than at the AEquator and that I shoud  have drawn my Consequences from these Principles To which I answerthat his Demonstrations aboutGravity are built upon wrong Suppositions as I shall shew by and by Nevertheless supposing that Gravity was greater towards the Poles than towards the AEquator in the Proportion that he assigns namely of the Ray of Curvature drawn into the Perpendicular to the Curve terminated at the Axis let us consider what will follow from his Principles  Let us then suppose the Earth at first in a fluid State A A the AxisdAE the AEquatorial Diameter b a Ray of Curvature d n another a c and dC two Lines  Fig II of282 of Tendency or Perpendiculars to the Curve intercepted by the Axis at c and C and d C A C two Tubes or Canals of the Fluid gravitating towards and commu nicating at C I say that according to Mons Mairans Principles of Gravity the Earth cannot preserve its ob long spheroidical Figure For since the Gravity at a  Is to the Gravity at d As d n  d C to a b  a c it will follow from the Nature of the Ellipse that the Gravity at A will be to the Gravity at d As A C4 to d C4 and therefore the Forces with which the Co lumns of Fluid A C and d C tend towards C will be as their Masses drawn into the Forces driving towards C that is as A C  A C4 to d C  d C4 Now by the Principles of Hydrostaticks it is evident that the Fluid in the Canal A C will cause the Fluid in the Canal d C to run out at d as long as A C  A C4 is greater than d C  d C4 And if the Canal C d be continued quite to  the Surface of the Fluid in A C will sink to  whilst the Surface of the Fluid in d C rises up to  in which Case as  C  C  the Point A will come to  and the Point d to  and the Curve A d being changd into   the oblong Spheroid will be changd into a Sphere the only Figure consistent with the AEquili brium of the fluid Parts according to Mons Mairans own Principles because then you will have A C4  d C4 and A C  A C4  d C  d C4 If we make use of Sir Isaac Newtons Principles in this Reasoning we shall also shew that an oblong spheroidical fluid Earth will be changd into a Sphere but not so fast as it does by Mons Mairans Laws for according to Sir Isaac Newton the Gravity at A Is to the Gravity at d As 5 C d 5 A C Q E D  Fig II NB Here283 NB Here we have supposd no diurnal Revolution for as soon as that begins the Centrifugal Force will raise the AEquatorial Parts and change the Sphere into a flatted Spheroid as has been before shewn and is allowd by Mons Mairan Now if we suppose the same Figure of the Earth but the Land at its first Creation as firm as it is now it will in that Case follow from Mons Mairans Prin ciples that the Sea must rise and overflow all the AEqua torial Regions tho the Earth had no diurnal Revolution and much more so when the Centrifugal Force arising from the diurnal Motion helps to carry the Water the same Way D E M O N S T R A T I O N Let P ae P AE  represent the Plane of a Meridian P P the Axis of the Earth supposd an oblong Spheroid ae AE the Diameter of the AEquator d e a ae Part of the Surface of the Earth ae A and e B two Perpendiculars to the Surface of the Earth which are here two Rays of Curvature f c the Surface of the Sea and f d e g b a ae c two Cylinders of SeaWater of equal Bases and equal Heights Since Gravity acts on the two equal Columns of Wa ter b a c ae f d e g in the reciprocal Ratio of the Ray of Curvature at the respective Places of the Columns drawn into that Part of it which Mons Mairan calls the Line of Tendency that is in the Ratio of e B  e Z to ae A  ae C the Weight of f e will be to the Weight of b ae As ae A  ae C to e B  e Z There fore if there be a Communication between the fluid Co  Fig III lumns284 lumns f e and b ae there cannot be an AEquilibriumtill the Quantity of Matter in f e becomes to the Quan tity of Matter in b ae reciprocally as the Gravity at the Place ae is to the Gravity at e and in that Case the Height g e will be reducd to k e if k e c ae e B  e Z ae A  ae C And consequently the Surface of the Sea will go thro the Points i k b c where b c under the AEquator is higher than i k towards the Poles Q E D NB That the Centrifugal Force will still add to the Height of the Sea at b c is plain from what we have said before And if we apply these Prin ciples to determine the differeut Lengths of Pen dulums swinging Seconds at Paris and at the AE quator from the Gravity at Paris compard to the Gravity at the AEquator in this Supposition of the Action of Gravity and Figure of the Earth a Pendulum must be shorter at the AEquator by more than 10 Lines without considering the Centrifugal Force and if the Centrifugal Force be taken into Consideration the Pendulums must be shortened near a whole Inch But this being about five Times more than agrees with Observation what proves too much proves nothing at all Having thus shewn that Mons Mairans Account of the Action of Gravity on several Places upon the Earths Surface can be of no Service for reconciling the Experiments made on Pendulums with the Figure of the Earth deducd from Mons Cassinis Measures I proceed to shew that his Demonstrations are founded up on wrong Principles And first in Relation to Gravity This Gentleman has followd Sir Isaac Newton in saying that Gravity increases in a duplicate reciprocal 2 Pro285 Proportion of the diminishd Distance from the Center of the Force and so vice versa but he has followd Sir Isaac Newton no farther than servd his present Pur pose otherwise he woud have known  That in respect to a Central Body as a Planet towards which others are attracted or impelld by Gravity this Law ob tains onlyas Bodies attracted are removd from the Sur face of the Planet to greater Distances from the Center compard with that Distance or as from greater Di stances they approach nearer to the Planet  That the greatest Action of Gravity is at the Surface of the Pla net  That afterwards in advancing towards the Center the Force of Gravity on the Body attracted continually grows less decreasing directly as the Distance and that this holds true in a Spheroid as well as a Sphere  That on different Parts of the Surface of the Earth in the Condition it is now the Gravity on Bodies is recipro cally as their Distance from the Center of the Earth  That though at a considerable Distance we look upon the Earth or any Planet or even the Sun as a Point in the Center of the Forces tending towards it endued with an absolute Force proportional to its Quantity of Matter yet when we come so near the Body as to consider the Space it takes up we are to take notice that the whole Attraction or Gravity of the Body is made up of the Sum of the Attraction of all its Parts pro perly combind and therefore that when a Corpuscle or Body attracted comes to be within the Planet or Body attracting the Matter above it draws it back in such a Manner that it leaves it only a Force to go on to wards the Center which is directly as the Distance as we have already said just as if a Body concentric to the Planet whether spherical or spheroidical had its Sur face just where the Corpuscle is and all the exterior Crust or Shell was annihilated VOLXXXIII S s  do286 I do not doubt but Mons Mairan will be of this Opinion when he has carefully and impartially examind the 12th and 13th Sections of the First Book of Sir I saac Newtons Principiaand the 18th 19th and 20th Prop of the Third Book And if he will be at the Pains to compare the 38th and 39th Proposition of the Third Book with the 66th of the First he will find that the Precession of the AEquinoxes is owing to the broad spheroidical Figure of the Earth and that if it had Mons Cassinis Figure the AEquinoctial Points woud move in Consequentia faster than they do now in An tecedentia Further Mons Mairan demonstrates that in an ob long Spheroid the Diminution of Gravity by the Cen trifugal Force encreases faster in going from the Poles to the AEquator than it woud do in a Sphere and faster in a Sphere than it woud do in a broad Spheroid and therefore woud shew  That notwithstanding the Sur  face of the Earth is nearer to the Center in MonsCas  sinis Figure than in Sir Isaac Newtons yet the  Centrifugal Force will diminish the Gravity so fast in  going from Paris to the AEquator that the shortening  of Pendulums to make them swing Seconds at the  AEquator may very well be accounted for that Way Now let us examine into this Matter to see whether the Cause is adequate to the Effect If the Distance from the Surface of the Earth at the Pole to the Center be 96 and the Distance of the Sur face at the AEquator be 95 the Distance of the Surface at Parisin the Latitude of 48 50will be 95562 c by the Property of the Ellipse Now since the Force of Gravity in different Places on the Earths Surface is reciprocally as the Distance from the Center and the Lengths of Pendulums that perform their Vibrations in the same Time are directly as the Force of Gravity therefore287 therefore the Length of Pendulums at Paris will be to their Length at the AEquator as 95 to 95562 c that is as 440555 c to 443165 c and consequently they must be lengthend 261 c Lines But as from Mons Mairans Principles the Diminution of Gravity by the Centrifugal Force is greater at the AEquator than at Paris hardly 1440 Part of the whole Gravity at the AEquator the Pendulums must be shortened in that Pro portion so that then the Length of a SecondPendulum will be 440555  261  1 Lines But as that Quan tity is greater than 440555 c therefore the Pendu lums upon the Whole must be lengthend Nay though we shoud allow a shortening of two Lines since by Ob servation Pendulums are found to be about two Lines shorter at the AEquator the oblong spheroidical Figure of the Earth cannot be consistent with the Experiments on Pendulums I beg Leave to set down Mons Mairans aforesaid Demonstration here that we may see whether he has assumd true Principles P R O P O S I T I O N V   XI The Centrifugal Force at any Degree of  Latitude taken upon the oblong Spheroid between  the AEquator and the Pole is less in Comparison  to the Centrifugal Force at the AEquator than it  woud be at the same Degree of Latitude taken upon  a Sphere or which is the same thing the Centri  fugal Force encreases more going from the Poles  towards the AEquator upon an oblong Spheroid  than upon a perfect Sphere and consequently Gra  vity diminishes more and a Pendulum must be more  See Mons Mairans Dissertation Article XI c S s 2 shortened288  shortened under the AEquator in the Hypothesis of  the oblong Spheroid than in that of a perfect  Sphere  Having describd an oval Curve of any Kind as  for Example the Ellipse  A D B E abovementioned  and inscribd the Circle D H E whose Radius is D C   half the shorter Axis D E upon A D take any  Point as R between the AEquator and the Pole and  from that Point to the Evoluta O T X draw the Ray  of Curvature R Twhich gives the Line of Tendency  R P Art IV Draw likewise from the common Cen  ter C to the Circumference of the Circle D H a Ra  dius C V parallel to P R and meeting the Circle at V  then from the Points R V draw the Lines R N V Z  perpendicular to the Axis A B  It must be observd First That as the Ellipse A D  represents a Meridian of the oblong Spheroid the  Circle D H represents a Meridian of a Sphere in the  same Plane  Secondly That the Point V on the Circular Me  ridian answers to the same Degree of Latitude as  the Point R upon the elliptical Meridian because  the Lines P R C V being parallel to each other and  perpendicular the one to the Ellipse and the other  to the Circle by Construction the touching Planes  or Horizons of the Points R V will also be pa  rallel  Thirdly Whence it follows that the Diminution of  the Centrifugal Force acting against Gravity on ac  count of its Obliquity to the Horizon Art X of Fig IV  the289  the same Degree of Latitude on the Elliptical and on  the Circular Meridian is the same in both Cases and  in the same Ratio as the absolute Centrifugal Forces  represented by the Perpendiculars R N V ZArtIX  Therefore to know whether the Centrifugal Force  whether absolute or relative of the Point Rupon the  oblong Spheroid A D B E be less or greater in respect  to the Centrifugal Force under the common AEquator  D E than the Centrifugal Force whether absolute or  relative of the correspondent PointVupon the Sphere  nothing more is requird than to see which is the  longest of the two Perpendiculars namely R N in  the oblong Spheroid or V Z in the Sphere since  these two Lines express the Radii of the Circles of  Revolution and consequently the absolute Quantity  of the Centrifugal Forces  4thly and lastly That the Ratio of the Centrifugal  Forces of two correspondent Points upon the oblong  Spheroid A D B E and the inscribd Sphere DHE to the  Centrifugal Force of their AEquators is the same suppo  sing the Sphere of any other Bigness and that it has  been determind here of the Diameter D E only to  render the Demonstration easier by giving the same  Consequent to the Antecedents R N and V Z For  if about the Center C and with the Radius C d the  Circle d h e be describd equal for Example to a  Meridian of a Sphere of the same Solidity as the ob  long Spheroid A D B E and the Radius C V be pro  ducd till it meet the Circle d h at the Point u and  u z be let fall perpendicular to the common Axis of  Revolution and parallel to V Z It is plain that  we shall always have V Z D C u z d C or  V ZD C  u zd C and consequently R ND C will have the  same290  same Ratio to V ZD C as to u zd C  Therefore in order to demonstrate that the Centri  fugal Force of a Point taken in any Latitude upon  the oblong Spheroid is less when compard to the Cen  trifugal Force of the like Point taken upon a Sphere  in respect to the Centrifugal Force at the AEquator  there is nothing more requird than to shew that R N   V Z because by that means we shall have R ND C   V ZD C  This being observd from the Point R draw the  Line R I parallel to the Axis A B and meeting the  Circle D H at K and the Diameter D E of the AEqua  tor at the Point I From the Point K having let fall  the Perpendicular K L  R N upon the Axis A B  and drawn K C to the Center C the Question will be  brought to this viz To know whether the Point V  coincides with the Point K or whether it is above it  towards D or below towards H  But C K  C V  C D  P R Art VIII there  fore C K and P R being both between the Parallels  A C R I the greatest C K is more inclind to them  than the least P R and the Angle K C A is less than  the Angle R P A  V C A And since these two  Angles have each of them one of their Sides coinciding  with the Line A C namely the Side A P of the Angle  R P A and the Side A C of the Angle K C A it fol  lows that the Side V C of the Angle V C A  R P A   K C A will go above C K between C K and C D  and meet the Line R I at the Point G between K and  I and the Circle D H at the Point V which conse  quently291  quently will be above R I between K and D There  fore C V  C G  G V is  P R  G V and con  sequently V Z which meets R I at the Point F is   Z F  F V  R N  F V and therefore R N   V Z  F V Therefore R N  V Z  And because the same Thing may be demonstrated  in respect of any other Point taken between the AE  quator and the Pole and that Gravity and conse  quently the Length of a Pendulum diminishes as the  Centrifugal Force encreases Therefore c Q E D C O R O L L A R Y  XII From what has been demonstrated and from  Prop 3 Art VIII it followsthat the Perpendicular  which is drawn from any Point of an oval Meridian  to the Axiswill be so much shorter in Comparison to  the Perpendicular drawn from the correspondent Point  of an inscribd circular Meridian as the Latitude is  greater and consequently by Art XI Num 3  the Centrifugal Force will be so much the less and  Gravity so much the greater upon the oblong Sphe  roid in respect to the Centrifugal Force and the Gra  vity under the AEquator  For as the Line R P does always decrease as the  Point R is taken nearer to the Pole A it is evident  that the Angle V C K will continually encrease in  respect to the Angles V C A K C A as it is their Dif  ference and consequently that the Perpendicular V Z  will be so much greater than the Perpendicular  K L  R N I pass over the Demonstration of the latter Part of his Proposition abovementioned which he deduces justly from his Construction if what he says Num 2 be right because in such a Case it cannot be calld in Que stion292 stion and proceed to an Observation that he makes af terwards viz  We must take care to observe in the  foregoing Propositions and Corollaries that the  Comparison is always made between two similar  Points of Latitude taken upon the two Spheroids  or upon one of the Spheroids and the Sphere  between the AEquator and the Poles in respect to  the Centrifugal Force upon the AEquator of any  one of these Spheroids or of the Sphere For if  we only compard absolutely the Centrifugal Force  of a Point of the AEquator of the one to the Cen  trifugal Force of a correspondent Point of the AE  quator of the other it is plain that it woud be  greater upon a flatted Spheroid than upon a Sphere  or than upon an oblong Spheroid of the same Soli  dity in the Ratio of the great Axis of the gene  rating Ellipse of the flatted Spheroid to the Di  ameter of the Sphere or to the shorter Axis of the  generating Ellipse of the oblong Spheroid And in  all Likelihood this must be the Reason that has  made others who have treated of this Subject to  imagine the very contrary of what I have demon  strated As Mons Mairan considers the Earth at rest in the Construction for his Demonstration above quoted and afterwards observes what Effect the Centrifugal Force will have upon Bodies on its Surface to diminish the Gra vity with which they endeavour to descend in their Line of Tendency R P He shoud not only have taken notice as he has done that the whole Centrifugal Force N R is not to be substracted from the Gravity at R as the whole Centrifugal Force C D is to be substracted from the whole Gravity at D because of the Obliquity of R N to P R but he should have observd also that the Obliquity of the Plane of the Parallel N Rin which 2 the293 the Centrifugal Force acts must alter the Line of Ten dency R P and change the Direction R P into R W somewhere between the Point P and the Center C for if there be a heavy Body as a Plummet hanging by a Thread in the Line S R or S P the Line of Tendency which has been supposd perpendicular to the Curve A R D without taking in the Effect of the Centrifugal Force as soon as the Spheroid revolves about its Axis the Body which woud fall in the Line S R acted upon only by one Force namely that of Gravity will now be acted upon by another Force at the same Time push ing it in the Line S s which is the same as R r and consequently will move in the Line S r diagonal of the Parailelogram s S R r or which is all one a Body placd at R will have its Line of Tendency in R W as I have already shewn in my first Dissertation on this Subject only I did not suppose the Earth a Spheroid before the diurnal Motion and therefore made use of the Line Z V instead of the Line N R so that it may be objected that the Angle r S R will not be so great in a Spheroid as in a Sphere because the Centrifugal Force which acts with the same Obliquity since N R P  Z V C is as much less in the Spheroid as N R is less than Z V But I was aware of that and therefore made the Angle R S r only of 5 Minutes when it really appears to be of almost six Minutes when the Earth is supposd sphe rical and therefore without coming to give the exact Quantity of the said Angle one may easily perceive that Mons Cassinis Difference of the Axis and AEqua torial Diameter will produce a Figure in which the Angle R S r will not be less than of 5 Minutes Such an Obliquity causd in the Direction of Gravity will render the oblong spheroidical Figure of the Earth impossible because then Fluids woud not have the Lines of their Gravity perpendicular to the Horizons of the V O L XXXIII T t Places294 Places where they are supposing the Horizons of Places to be Planes touching the Curve of the Earth in those Places and Plumb Lines woud be so far out of the Perpendicular to Lines of Level as to make an Angle easy to be observed as I have shewn in my former Paper But if the same Cause be supposd to act upon the Sea to make it level as makes heavy Bodies to fall which certainly must then indeed Lines of Level will be per pendicular to Plumb Lines and the Level of the Sea taken always for the Horizon of a Place will not be a Plane touching the Earth but cutting it towards the Poles and consequently the Water will be carried to wards the AEquator as was before shewn Besides the Difference of the Action of the Centrifugal Force woud not be so great between correspondent Points of the same Latitude in the Spheroid and in the Sphere for when the Line of Tendency R P is by the Centri fugal Force changd into R W the Point R upon the Spheroid does no longer correspond in Latitude with the Point V upon the Sphere but must be taken nearer to V so that the Line R W may become parallel to V C and R W A  V C A If it be alledged here that Mons Mairan supposes the Earth in Motion and takes in the Effect of the Cen trifugal Force when he makes the Line of Tendency to be R P I answer that if he had considerd the Earth as revolving upon its Axis he woud not have made V C the Line of Tendency of a spherical Earth in Motion since it is the Line of Tendency of such an Earth at rest In Mons Mairans Observation abovementioned he says  that we are not to compare the Centrifugal Force at the AEquator of an oblong Spheroid with the Cen trifugal Force at the AEquator of a Sphere or at the AEquator295  AEquator of a flatted Spheroid of the same Solidity  allowing that then it woud be greater in the Sphere  and still greater in the flatted Spheroid but only the  Centrifugal Forces in several Latitudes upon the same  Figure  But I beg Leave to differ from him for the following Reasons First Because the Force of Gravity is not the same at the AEquator of the flatted Spheroid as it is at the AEquator of the Sphere or as it is at the AEquator of the oblong Spheroid Secondly Because it is not the same in different La titudes in either of the Spheroids See Sir Isaac New ton Lib 3 Prop 19 and 20 And Mons Mairans Way of arguing will only serve in Case the Gravity shoud be the same in all the Points of the Surface of the Earth in his Figure and also in the two other Figures For Example let the uniform Gravity be calld g and First let the Centrifugal Force at the AEquator of the flatted Spheroid be calld c  2 and the Centrifu gal Force in any Latitude as for Example the Lati tude of Paris as it is diminished on Account of a shor ter Cosine of Latitude and likewise on Account of its Obliquity to the Line of Tendency be calld c  2  l the Difference of the Diminution of Gravity at Paris and at the AEquator will be  g   c  2   g   c  2  l  l Secondly Let the Centrifugal Force at the AEquator of the Sphere be calld c  1 and the Centrifugal Force at the Latitude of Paris be calld c  1  l  m the Difference of the Diminution of Gravity at T t 2 Paris296 Paris and at the AEquator in a spherical Earth will be g  c  1  g  c  1  l  m  l  m Thirdly Let the Centrifugal Force at the AEquator of the oblong Spheroid be calld c and the Centrifugal Force at Paris be calld c  l  m  n the Difference of the Diminution of Gravity at Paris and at the AE quator in an oblong spheroidical Earth will be g  c  g  c  l  m  n  l  m  n Now if Gravityshoud in every Case be equal to g it is evident that the shortening of Pendulums at the AEquator woud be greater in the oblong Spheroid than in the Sphere or in the flatted Spheroid because as the Lengths of Pendulums diminish with the Gravity those Lengths will be at Paris and at the AEquator when compardas g  c  2  l to g  c  2 in the flatted Spheroid as g  c  1  l  m to g  c  1 in the Sphere and as g  c  l  m  n to g  c in the oblongSpheroid and consequentlyfromwhat M Mai ran has demonstrated this Ratio of g  c  l  m  n to g  c being greater than either of the others the Pendulums must be shortened in the oblong Spheroid But as the Force of Gravity is less at the AEquator of the flatted Spheroid than at the AEquator of the Sphere or of the oblong Spheroid of the same Solidity let us express its Quantity in the three Cases by g  sg and g  sand we shall then find the Lengths of the Pendulumsat the AEquator of the three Solids as g  s  c  2 g  c  1 and g  s  c consequently the Lengths of Pendulums297 Pendulums will be greatest at the AEquator of the ob long Spheroid because g  s  c is the greatest Quan tity Lastly To compare the Lengths of Pendulums at the AEquator of the oblong Spheroid thus found with their Lengths at the Latitude of Paris upon the said Spheroid  Let us express the Excess of Gravity at the AEquator whereby it is greater than at Paris because in this Figure Paris is farther from the Center of the Earth than the AEquator by 1190 Part by the Letter s and the Excess of the Centrifugal Force at the AEquator above that Part of it which acts directly against Gravity at Paris by l  m  n the Gravity at Paris by g and the Centrifugal Force at the AEquator by c then g  s  c will still represent the diminishd Gravity and answer to the Length of Pendulums at the AEquator whilst g  c  l  m  n or g  c  l  m  n re presents the diminishd Gravity and consequently the Length of Pendulums at Paris If s be equal to l  m  n Pendulums will be as long at the AEquator as at Paris and if s be greater than l  m  n Pendu lums will be longer at the AEquator But making all possible Allowance in Favour of Mons Mairans Hy pothesis no Calculation will bring l  m  n to be greater than or ever equal to s Therefore Mons Mairans Demonstrations abovementioned are of no Force to prove the Earth to be an oblong Spheroid And now I think I have answerd all that relates to the Figure of the Earth in Mons Mairans Disser tation in shewing That his Conjectures can neither be supported by those Physical Principles which Sir Isaac Newton has Mathematically deducd from un questioned298 questioned Observations and Experiments accurately made nor even by those Principles which He M Mai ran has assumd to serve his intended Purpose  That his Demonstrations relating to the Difference of the A ction of the Centrifugal Force are of no Service to him for reconciling the Experiments made on Pendulums with Mons Cassinis Measures because when ap plied to Sir Isaac Newtons Principles they will make Pendulums longer at the AEquator than at Paris and when applied to Mons Mairans own Principles they will make them a whole Inch shorter at the AE quator than at Paris contrary to all Observations which at a Medium make Pendulums but about two Lines or 1661000 of an Inch longer at the AEquator than at Paris  That he has built his Demonstrations upon a wrong Notion of Gravity  And that he has not considerd what is most material in the Effect of the Centrifugal Force acting on Bodies descending by their Gravity between the AEquator and the Poles namely the Alteration of their Line of Di rection which woud make them fall out of the Per pendicular towards the AEquator I shall add one more Philosophical Argument given me by a Friend to whom I communicated my Thoughts on this Subject because it is wholly independent on those Principles of Philosophy concerning which some of the Gentlemen that believe the oblong spheroidical Figure of the Earth and the English Philosophers are not yet agreed and it is this If the Earth was of an oblong spheroidical Figure higher at the Poles than the AEquator the Axis of its Revolution woud either to thro one of its short Diameters or be continually changing unless the said Axis did exactly coincide with the Axis of the Figure D E299 D E M O N S T R A T I O N Suppose such an oblong Figure as A a  fixd to the Axis P p at the Center C but capable of moving freely round it towards P or towards p yet so as to be obligd to move with the Axis when it is turned round Sup pose now the Poles P and p to be fixd and the Body thus constituted to be turnd swiftly round the Axis P p then if the Angle A C P be oblique and the Fi gure A D a E be oblong the Parts A C and C a will ac quire a Centrifugal Force which will enlarge the Angle p C A till it comes to be a right one Besides this a Velocity will be generated in the Motion while A is going towards the Perpendicular  C which will make it go farther on towards P as to B with a Motion which will after that be retarded till the Centrifugal Force has Strength enough to send it back again the contrary Way and so it will move continually with a reciprocal Mo tion like the Oscillation of a Pendulum and if a little of this Motion be lost at every Oscillation then the ob long Figure A D a E will at last move quietly about its lesser Axis D E coinciding with P p If A a did not at first exactly coincide with P p the Centrifugal Force will have the abovementioned Effect and that this is not the Case in the Earth is more than probable because the unequal Distribution of Sea and Land besides the Phaenomena of the Tides must make the Axis of its Gravity and consequently the Axis of its Revolution to differ from the Axis of the oblong Spheroid if the Earth had such a Fi gure without considering that every Earthquake woud alter so nice an AEquilibrium which once lost woud never be recoverd again  Fig V To300 To leave nothing unexamindrelating to the Contro versy I have again considerd the Measures and Obser vationsmentioned in the Account of the Meridian drawn thro France in the Memoirs of the Royal Academy for the Year 1720 and I find them to want a great deal of the Accuracy requird in so nice a Point as deter mining the different Lengths of Degrees upon the Sur face of the Earth To prove my Assertion I beg that the Reader will examine the following Tables whereby it appears that if any thing certain can be deducd from the said Observations and Measures either taken as they are or reducd to the Level of the Sea by the Rules given by Mons Cassini it will be in Favour of Sir Isaac Newtons Figure of the Earth rather than theirs In the following Table the first Column gives the Names of Places the secondthe Distances from Paris according to the Measures taken by the French Gentle men the

2502 39184 56380 In this Table in the third Column overagainst St Sauvier the Number which was 139944 is corrected to make it 139937 to the Advantage of the oblong Fi gure In the sixth Column the Numbers appear so ir regular as to be unfit to decide this Controversy Then if a Comparison be made between Dunkirk St Sauvier which is very near the Middle of France and almost in the Meridian of Paris and Collioure the Measure ment is absolutely in Favour of Sir Isaac Newtons Theory the mean Degree between Dunkirk and St Sauvier being larger by about 64 Toises than between S Sauvier and Collioure and to reduce them even to an Equality there must be a greater Alteration made in the Situation of those three Places than it is reason able to suppose their Observations to be capable of ad mitting Here follows the Comparison Dunkirk and Collioure 57061 Dunkirk and Paris 56960 Paris and Collioure A mean Degree is 57097 Dunkirk and S Sauvier 570904 S Sauvier and Collioure 570265 According to Mons Picard 57060 2 To303 To conclude I will propose a Method of observing the Figure of the Shadow of the Earth in Lunar Eclipses whereby the Difference between the Diameters in the oblong spheroidical Figure if there be such an one as Mons Cassini affirms viz of 96 to 95 may be disco verd Let P AE P AE  represent the Earth seen from the Sun at the Time of the Summer Solstice it is evident that the same Figure will express the Section of the Earths Shadow at the Moons Distance as seen from the Earth IfEE represents the Ecliptick AE AE will be the shortest Diameter of the Section and if L L be taken for the Moons Way in a total and central Eclipse of the Moon by observing the Time which is spent in the Passage of the Center of the Moon thro the Shadow and reducing that Time to Seconds of a Degree of a great Circle of the Heavens we shall have the least Diameter of the Sha dow Again let the same Letters  represent the same Things only here the Section of the Shadow is such as the Earth will cast at the AEquinox and the Eclipse of the Moon is here supposed partial its Center just touching the Shadow When the Moons Center is got to c if the Latitude of its Center or its Distance from the E cliptick be observd we shall have the Length c C nearly equal to the longest Semidiameter of the Shadow Now comparing c C  in this Figure to L C  in the former the Difference between c C and C P Fig 7 and between C L and C AE Fig 6 not being worth notice they ought to be to one another as 96 to 95 which in such a Shadow will give a Difference of a bout 25 at a Medium sensible enough to be observed notwithstanding the Penumbra If therefore those A  Fig VI  Fig VII  Fig VII  Fig VI U u 2 stronomers304 stronomers who have Instruments nice enough and suf ficient Skill in the Management of them to take Angles to 3 or 4 Seconds of a Degree will observe what I have been mentioning in total and partial Eclipses of the Moon by such Observations they will easily convince us that the Figure of the Earth is such as Mons Cas sini supposes it or convince him that he has been mi staken The Semidiameter of the Earths Shadow when the Earth is in Perihelio and the Moon in Apogaeo is 38 or 2280 without considering the Encrease of the Shadow on account of the Atmosphere of the Earth which woud make it 39 or 2340 allowing one Second for a Mile and the Semidiameter of the Shadow when the Earth is in Aphelio and the Moon in Perigaeo is 46 20 or 2780 which encreased on account of the Atmosphere of the Earth will bring it to 47 20 or 2840 Now if the Proportion of 95 to 96 be taken in both Cases you will have these Analo 95 96 2340 2364 6 gies So that 23646 95 96 2840 28698  2340  246 will be the Difference of the Semidiameters when the Section of the Shadow is the least and 28698  2840  298 will be the Difference of Semidiameters when the Section of the Shadow is the greatest the Sum of those Differences 246  298 halved will give the Difference when the Section of the Shadow is at a Medium  27 4 from which if we take 24 because in Fig 7 C c is a little less than C P and in Fig 6 L C is something greater than AE C we shall have C c in Fig 7 to compare with L C in Fig 6 which will exceed it by 25 if Mons Cassinis Figure of the Earth be the true one II A

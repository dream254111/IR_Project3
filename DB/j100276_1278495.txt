those Inns have blazed with electric lights for half a century Of the authorities relied on in the case under discussion few are in point Many were cases where such evidence was held to have been rightly ex cluded Others were cases where other errors obviously prejudicial accom panied the erroneous admission of evidence resulting in a reversal State v Owens Io9 Iowa I cited in the opinion and Brann v Campbell 86 Ind 516 and Bank v Blakeman I9 Okla io6 cited in a text book which the opinion cites seem to be the only authorities supporting the decision of the Arkansas court and even these had already been discredited by Patrick v State supra because they did not involve a statutory rule and Patrick v State was expressly reaffirmed as sound On the other hand Green v State Tex Crim Appeals I2 S W 872 which was also cited in the same text book denounced the doctrine of reversible error in such cases It clearly was not the force of authority but the instinct for technicality that brought about this decision It is only an example of a tendency which manifests itself in a thousand ways The comfortable indifference of former times has been rudely shaken by the social renaissance ushered in by the great war and nowhere will reform be more imperatively demanded than in judical administration There can be no doubt that we are at least a generation behind Great Britain in our legal methods Fifteen years ago Mr Wigmore sounded a warning which apparently has not yet been generally heeded Speaking of the American doctrine of granting new trials for error in applying the rules of evidence he said The whole doctrine no doubt has its deepest roots in the inveterate and unconscious professional instinct which grods to venerate unduly the rules that form its daily mental pabulum Whether in civil or criminal cases it has done more than any other one rule of law to increase the delay and ex pense of litigation to encourage defiant criminality and oppression and to foster the spirit of litigious gambling Added to this is the indirect result produced upon the everlurking animal instinct of gregarious human brutal ity which takes the failures of criminal justice as its pretext and sates itself with cruel lynchings    Some of the instances of its enforcement would seem incredible even in the justice of a tribe of African fetishworshippers    We shall some day awake to be convinced that a system of necessary rules of evidence can exist and be obeyed without affixing indiscriminately to every contravention of them the monstrous penalty of a new trial I Wig more on Evidence 2I We can only hope that the next fifteen years will show more progress in making procedure the servant of justice than the last fifteen have shown E R S DAMAGES FOR FRIGHT AND THt PROOF OF PROXIMATE CAUSEIf a recent case in the Iowa court infra is compared with a line of decisions in the equity courts in which nuisances productive of fear have been abated some light may be thrown on the obscure interlacing of the two doctrines sug gested by the caption of this note In Holdorf v Holdorf Iowa I918 I69 407MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW N W 737 the plaintiff testified at the trial that the defendant came up to ward me and he did as if he was to strike me He did not touch her but she later suffered a miscarriage accompanied by severe pains and lacerations Held she may recover in an action of assault for resulting injuriesthe act of the defendant being willful This is the stock situation of recovery given where there is fright without physical impact but resulting in physical injury and might have been settled on the precedent of Green v Shoemaker and Co inI Md 69 8 MICH LAW REV 44 but the court prefers to lay stress on its own precedent of Watson v Dilts 116 Iowa 249 in which the willfulness of the tort is the foundation for the recovery rather than any trespass to the person proved by physical results One of the best of the extrajudicial discussions of this oftlitigated ques tion is the article by Professor Bohlen in 41 AMER LAW REG 141 on the Right to Recover for Injury Resulting from Negligence Without Impact which appeared shortly after the decision in Dulieu v White 90oI 2 K B 669 and approves of the doctrine there laid down He has concluded that fright may be a link in the chain of causation leading to actionable physical injury but that fright or mental suffering alone was not legal damage at common law Material tangible injury had to be shown before a recovery could be had in an action for negligence See also the excellent note in 3 L R A N S 49 It is submitted that this doctrine though technically correct and often asserted in judicial utterances is doubtful in experience and surely not fol lowed by the courts as a matter of fact The common law has from an early day given a recovery for mental suffering where the proximate cause was clear although the courts have veiled their real intent by branding these cases as exceptions or by saying that the recovery was really for something else The action of assault where there is no physical impact recognizes a recovery for fright although only nominal damages are given Beach v Hancock 27 N H 223 The trespass to the person here is nothing more than an apprehension of bodily injury and where the fright was serious substantial damages were recoverable Small v Lonergan 8I Kan 48 25 L R A N S 976 Even though courts have insisted on accompanying physical impact they have not required it in tort actions where the wrong was willfulon the theory it seems that aggravated compensatory damages were warranted in such cases Craker v Ry I875 36 Wis 657 Spade v Lynn I897 I68 Mass 285 a much quoted dictum This is in effect giving a recovery for mental suffering alone under a clear cut exception In the ac tion for breach of contract of marriage in which the feelings are manifestly the subject matter of the contract the recovery for mental suffering is un disputed Though called an exception it is more correctly a situation where the courts are convinced that the suffering is undoubtedly a proximate con sequence of the breach It was suggested in 8 MICH LAW REV 44 cf Ward v West Jersey Ry 65 N J L 385that the chief trouble of the courts which has caused the bewildering contrariety of decisions was largely a difficulty of proof of the proximate relation between the wrongful act alleged and the result complained of The courts start with the proposition that there 408NOTE AND COMMENT is no recovery for mental suffering at common law and when they begin to depart from this pronouncement because of the social demand that man ifest wrongs shall be redressed they hold on to some well recognized cause of action at common law to which the recovery for mental suffering may be added In other words they deny a recovery and allow it in the same breath where the demand for a recovery is imperative There are indeed numerous situations where a direct recovery is actually given through such indirect means In the action of seduction the chief ele ment of damage is mental suffering in the form of humiliation and parental anxiety and yet recovery has been based on the fiction of loss of service where that service was no more than serving a cup of tea Kendrick v McCrary 1852 II Ga 603 and the case therein cited Here too as in the breach of contract of marriage it is undeniable that the gist of the action mental suf fering is the proximate consequence of the breach Most of the jurisdictions have allowed a recovery where the fright has followed a violation of one of the constitutional rights of life liberty or propertysuch violation giving a right to an independent cause of action Where the courts were convinced that a serious injury traceable to a certain cause or class of causes had in fact been occasioned by the mental suffering inflicted they contrived a recov ery by relying on or straining some recognized legal right or concocting some new right the violation of which could be regarded as the proximate cause of the suffering the damages for the suffering could thus be added into the verdict The purpose it would appear was to allow recovery and at the same time to limit it to certain specified cases so as to shut out the possibility of fraud ulent claims In Lesch v Ry 97 Minn 503 the agents of the defendant while committing a trespass on the premises of plaintiffs husband frightened the plaintiff The court allowed her a recovery for the fright because it was accom panied by a willful invasion of her homestead and created it would seem a new action to suit the casetrespass quare homesteadium fregit Compensa tion was likewise allowed for the mental suffering endured consequent on the mutilation of the body of the plaintiffs deceased husband Recovery was founded on the willful invasion of the plaintiffs right to the disposition of her husbands bodya right which is to say the least a much disputed one The court realized that the usual difficulty of ascertaining the cause was absent in such a case MITCHELL J said That mental suffering and injury to the feelings would be ordinarily the natural and proximate result of knowledge that the remains of a deceased husband had been mutilated is too plain to admit of argument Nevertheless the court preferred to say that the viola tion of the right was the proximate cause of the suffering rather than the act of mutilation itself Larson v Chase 47 Minn 307 Similarly the court in the principal case needlessly introduced the element of willfulness as a reason for recovery Then there are the troublesome telegraph cases in which the plaintiff endures sorrow because unable to attend a funeral of a near or dear relative through the neglect of the company to deliver or transmit promptly a telegram announcing the death Mentzer v W U Tel Co 93 Ia 752 The courts have struggled hard to find a legal hook in these cases They have given the sendee a right ex contractu as a third party beneficiary 409MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW to a contract by the terms of which the company is warned that suffering will follow a breach and a right ex delictu has been found based on the companys public duty But it should be noted that as the relatives are more distant from the plaintiff the courts are less inclined to rely on their creative faculties Thus where the plaintiffs sorrow was caused by reason of inability to attend his motherinlaws funeral recovery was denied although the court did not admittedly base its opinion on the popular conception of this hypenat ed relationship The case is of value as pointing out that the courts as a fact always look to see if there is a proximate cause before the legal hooks are used to help out the situation Rowell v W U Tel Co 75 Tex 26 The contrary view is comprehensively expressed in W U Tel Co v Choteau 28 Okla 664 An examination of a few of the illogical conclusions reached by the courts will point out what the courts have come to in trying to put artificial restric tions on this inevitable demand for recovery In Victorian Ry v Coultas L R 13 App Cases 222 the court refused to allow recovery for fright with physical result because there was no physical impact i e the direct trespass to the person by the wrongful act was held to be a necessary hook to which the recovery for fright might be attached In Dulieu v White supra the court disapproving of the Victorian Ry case held that the physical result was sufficient for the purpose though there was no physical impact In Mitchell v Rochester Ry 151 N Y I07 the court insisted that the previous impact was necessary and by what seems to be a logical fallacy concluded that physical result could under no circumstances be a legal consequence of fright or be used as a hook to which to tie recovery The court starts with the basic assumption that there is no recovery for fright at common law there fore it is difficult to understand how a defendant would be liable for its consequences The argument is fright as a cause of action is zero but ex nihilo nihil fit Cf LUCRETIUS Di RERUM NATURA I50 205 zero can only produce zero therefore the consequences of fright are zero Q E D This too even when the consequences have been plainly proved in court Dulieu v White fortunately disclosed the incorrectness of such a conclusion and specifically rebutted the Mitchell case which had been urged by counsel The principal case in disregard of Dulieu v White fell victim to this logic The action was for damages for the consequences of fright and there is nothing in the case to show that the plaintiff was asking for a recovery for the fright causing the miscarriage Yet the court went to the trouble of finding out first that fright caused by a willful act was recoverable If right justified re covery so did its consequences and the objection of the Mitchell case could not hold But would it not have been more correct for the court to have said sim ply that fright can be a link in the chain of causation Indeed Bohlen explain ed Wilkinson v Dozonton not on the theory of willfulness but on the principle that the defendant intended to create a fright so severe as to be obviously calculated to cause serious physical results Here again it is evident that the trouble has been caused by the failure to take a proper attitude on the question of proximate cause The law courts have a lesson to learn from the common sense attitude of 4IONOTE AND COMMENT the American equity courts which have enjoined the erection of hospitals as nuisances because of the consequent fear of contagion produced in the minds of the residents whose comfortable enjoyment of the premises was thus curtailed And though the fear was only a subjective one wholly un warranted by science the courts have not withheld the injunction In Everett v Paschall 6I Wash 47 where the complainants said they feared infection from a tuberculosis hospital the court said The question is not whether the fear is founded in science but whether it exists not whether it is imaginary but whether it is real in that it affects the movements and the conduct of men Such fears are actual and must be recognized by the courts as other emotions of the human mind To prove the actuality of the fear the court cited the treatises of pscychologists The case does not stand alone but is supported by a group of American decisions cited therein The English courts however have followed a decision of Lord Hardwicke in 3 Atk 750 that the fears of mankind though they may be reasonable ones will not create a nuisance This is repudiated by the Washington court Though there is no question of damages in the injunction cases they are pertinent in our inquiry since they show that the court took mental disturbance into ac count as an element of legal injury where the proximate cause was clear and the injury was undoubted Just so soon as the courts drop their theorizing about the existence or nonexistence of a right to recover at common law for mental suffering and look at the problem in the light of the actuality of the cause and the con sequence then all trouble arising from arbitrariness and needless pursuit of fiction will be obviated At one time there was even doubt whether damages for mental suffering were recoverable even though accompanied by physical impact But as soon as the courts realized that the suffering actually existed they began to allow recoveryas Lord Wensleydale said in Lynch v Knight 9 H L Cas 577 where a material damage occurs and is connected with it it is impossible a jury in estimating it should altogether overlook the feelings of the party interested In Merill v Los Angeles Gas Co etc 158 Cal 499 513 the court allowed recovery for mental worry caused by dis figurement of the plaintiffs face so as to make him feel that he would be a source of ridicule to his fellows The court said The whole matter pos sesses more academic than practical significance    At the suggestion of defendants counsel the jury is instructed to disregard all elements of mental suffering except that arising solely from physical pain Can the jury do it Will the jury do it It is mere selfstultification to believe that it will do other than to make up its verdict under the rule which while not one of law is one of well nigh universal conductthe rule of Put yourself in his place However it has been indicated that the proximate cause is equal ly evident and with equal force a fact before the mind of the jury where there is no accompanying physical impact In such cases the courts have actually allowed a recovery although the true nature of the action was hid den behind a recovery for something else In Massachusetts there must be physical impact but in Driscoll v Gaffey 207 Mass I02 there was no more than a scintilla of evidence of injury from without This case was forcefully 41IMICHIGAN LAW REVIEW criticized by the court in Speaiman v McCrary 4 Ala App 473 482 the rule of nonliability which is claimed to exist in such a case does not involve the denial of the right to be compensated in damages for an injury caused by fright but merely has the effect of making the right to recover such damages dependent upon the existence of a feature of wrongful occurrence which confessedly may be quite trivial and amount to no more than a merely tech nical breach of duty resulting in no appreciable harm to him besides being in itself a thing the existence of which may often be shown by evidence even more readily fabricated and less easy to refute than that in reference to the injury attributable to mental fright or shock The same criticism would ap ply against the case which said that dust in the eyes would be sufficient physical impact Porter v Lackawanna Ry 73 N J L 405 In a word have not the courts actually allowed recovery for fright in the cases of nominal physical impact and the cases of willful or intentional fright The courts have admitted that wounding a mans feelings is as much actual damage as breaking his limbs Head v Ga Pac Ry 79 Ga 358 and that it would be a reproach to the law if physical injuries might be recovered for and not those incorporeal injuries which would cause much greater suffering and humiliation Douglas v Stokes 149 Ky 506 509 Since as the court says in Spearman v McCrary supra we know of no legal reason for deny ing that any agency is the proximate cause of a given result when it is as a matter of fact then why not throw aside fictions and regard mental suffering standing alone as a legal wrong on which an action for damages may be based But see St Louis Etc Ry v Taylor 84 Ark 42 A J L IMPLIED CONDITION INVOLVING IMPOSSIBILITY OF PERFORMANCEEarly in 1914 the defendants contracted to sell to the plaintiffs a quantity of Finland birch timber The practice was to send the timber direct by sea from Finnish ports Before any timber was delivered the war broke out and the presence of German warships in the Baltic made the direct shipment by water im possible The contract contained no war force majeure or suspension pro vision Held that the contract was not dissolved and the defendants were liable for damages for nondelivery of the timber Blackburn Robbin Co Lim v Allen  Sons Lim 1918 87 L J K B 1085 The doctrine of implied conditions has been brought before the English courts more prominently since the outbreak of the war than ever before by reason of the many causes of impossibility of performance produced by the war On the whole it is clear that the courts of England have not allowed themselves to be drawn away from established rules in spite of the great pressure of the war emergency thus exhibiting in a striking way the judicial poise which has always been characteristic of British judges The leading recent case was Krell v Henry I903 2 K B 740 which held that a contract for hiring a flat on Pall Mall for the two days on which it was announced that the coronation procession would pass along Pall Mall was subject to the implied condition that the procession should take place though nothing was said about it in the contract The language of that case 412

j100358,The School Review,1074230,The Differentiation of the High School the Coming Movement in Education,i244457,THE DIFFERENTIATION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL THE COMING MOVEMENT IN EDUCATION Two articles in the February number of the School Review treat ist Of the High School and its enemies 2d Of the Curri culum for Secondary Education now under consideration by the National Council of Education Permit me to say that I do not think the problem has yet been grasped in its entirety and that it cannot be satisfactorily settled until all the factors are considered The opposition to the high school has lain in the facts that but a small proportionfive per cent of the school population are there educated and that its curriculum has been too much sub ordinated to college and University requirements The last error is now perceived yet not sufficiently perceived When this is remedied the first objection will also vanish But this can only be done by treatment of the broadest and most thorough kind The educational methods of our country have been and are still for the most part scholastic an education from books an impart ing of information about things There has been scarcely any in structionin the schoolsin creation in taking the raw material of nature and changing it into useful and beautiful forms in doing that which the vast majority of people have to do for their life work and because imperfectly trained do very imperfectly A vast amount of creative work has been done outside of the schools witness our roads buildings manufactures I will not say our art there is as yet so little to boast offor the manifold defects of all which we are largely indebted to the lack of training of creative instruction in the schools The workers of the United States number about 22000000 Of these nearly half are agriculturists 25 per cent artisans 20 per cent in commerce 5 per cent professional Of the school population of 8oooooo i per cent nearly is in institutions of higher education 5 per cent in high schools and secondary in stitutions 94 per cent in the primary and grammar schools Compare the two percentages Twentyfive state universities have been founded and all sustained at large expense to educate the very much less than one per cent of the school populationThe Differentiation of the High School who will pass into the professional class No lover of knowledge will regret the state universities or one dollar of the expense though there may be a cry of class legislation And every lover of knowledge will rejoice over the thousand or so of high schools with their 400000 pupils But every thoughtful educator must ask how well are we educating the 94 per cent of children who do not go beyond the grammarschool many of whom indeed do not finish its course Why do not more go on to the high school  Is the high school not fitting them in the best manner for their work in life  There is one answer to these questions It is the struggle for existence that keeps children out of the high school and that takes them out of the grammarschool It is because they are not there taught what they must do in life because they are too much instructed in scholastic and not enough in creative knowledge that their parents think they can not afford to give them more schooling and therefore take them away and put them to breadwinning It is a truism to say that the education of a country should be adapted to its needs but in truth our education is not adapted to our present needs We are giving a special education to the smaller class in the communitythe professionaland making no provision for 94 per cent of the workers Agriculture manu factures and commerce are the three material elements of national prosperity That these three may attain high perfection is the constant effort of modern states That this effort may be success ful it must be seconded in fact the initiative must be taken by the school I am convinced that the coming movement in education is that the school shall largely assist in training the child for its future special work in life As the workers of the nation are agricultur ists artisans and commercial the differentiation will naturally begin in the high school by the addition of a commercial and an artindustrial course These two courses will meet the needs of the commercial and artisan classes and the latter will also assist the agriculturist if another is not specially organized for him The commercial course will give the special training of the so called business colleges bookkeeping commercial arithmetic geography and law with typewriting and stenography With these should be carried on the present courses in English science 4I9The School Review and a modern language The time given should be two and when practicable three years The artindustrial course will have spe cial training in drawing and working in metal wood leather clay and other material Like the commercial it will dovetail in with a selection from the present high school studies The present university course should be continued not only for those who intend to take the higher education but as a liberal educa tion for those who do notfor the most part young women The people at large have been for some time feeling the need of this special education tentative efforts have been made in vari ous places but without any welldigested scheme Two hundred thousand pupils are being instructed more or less in various parts of the country in manualtraining industries The most of this work is done in grammar schools and of course imperfectly but the movement is in the right direction The only commercial high school of which I know is that of San Francisco It has day and evening sessions some 800 pupils is well conducted and highly valued Commercial departments also are a part of the high school in Pittsburg Detroit Waltham probably elsewhere In California such departments will be organized this year at Stocktoll and Los Angeles For three years San Francisco also carried on at public expense the Coggswell Polytechnic School This has now reverted to its trustees and artindustrial features are now being tacked on to the commercial high school No doubt it will shortly differentiate into an artindustrial school Of the two differentiations at the present stage of our national progress I consider the artindustrial the more important Skilled artisans are at present a great need of our country Be cause we did not train them we imported them so largely that for eign artisans control our labor unions and exclude American boys Or rather the lack of training on the part of American boys exclude them from the art industries France is not so neglectful She is the most skillful and artistic manipulator in the world of the raw materials cotton wool silk metal etc and she is so largely be cause out of one hundred and seventy schools in Paris one hun dred have workshops connected with them Mr Mundella then minister of education in Gladstones cabinet told me several years ago that the South Kensington Museum was founded as a commercial enterprise to instruct the British artisan and enable him to compete with his continental rivals and he added it is worth millions of pounds a year to England  420The Differentiation of the High School That artindustrial training is felt to be a great educational need is shown by some recent benefactions notably that of Mr Drexel in Philadelphia and Mr Armour in Chicago The high er education is now pretty well provided for It is the secondary that needs the stream of gifts But the work is so vast that pub lic aid must supplement private benefaction The plant needed for a commercial course is not very expensive chiefly type writing machines and few cities need be deterred by it But the plant for an artindustrial department is quite another matter forges lathes tools and an abundance of materials to work with When the need is once clearly seen however clear headed communities will not be deterred by it Naturally artindustrial departments will first be engrafted on high schools established in manufacturing centers and the larger cities As their advantages are felt the movement will extend to the smaller towns The three great departments of knowledge are literature science and art For the first only provision was made in our early edu cational history During the last thirty years large room has been made for the second It is now time to crown the work by the harmonizing presence of the third and most beautiful of the sisters Our roads have been made our towns and cities built No doubt they need to be remade and rebuilt That is a part of the process of the ages But the era of clearing a place for our selves and the era of strengthening ourselves among the nations have passed Now has come the era of advancement These three eras are like the three elements of style clearness strength beauty and have a like natural relation If our manufactures the things we make are to be beautiful our children must be taught the principles and practices of art There are plenty of signs abroad that the demand for the trained skilled hand is in creasing That we are yet far inferior in skill to other nations is evident by the thousands of millions we pay them annually The tariff charges alone last year were upwards of 450oooooo It may be objected that this movement will be a mere organiz ing of tradeschools Better tradeschools than no schools at all Ninetenths of the youth of the country leave school at fourteen many even earlier Artindustrial and commercial schools would hold a large proportion two or three years longer for then they would be prepared and well prepared for their work in life Par 421The School Review ents would not grudge the time nor boys work unwillingly Few boys are mentally fitted to be scholars or to take a University course The majority are wellconstituted mentally to be good artisans men of business agriculturists They will be much better workmen for good preparation Moreover as already in dicated some of the usual high school studies will be united with the special training The generals will not be neglected while the specials are enforced The citizen will be more in telligent and the artisan more skilled Young lives will not be stunted and dwarfed by being driven to work at too tender an age Ideals will have time to develop under good teaching at an age when ideals are formed the standard of intelligence will be raised the solving of many social problems assisted more efficient men and women be trained for the work of the commonwealth Herbert Miller Marysville Cal ENDOWED SCHOOLS The secondary schools of this country may be divided into three classes high schools maintained by general taxation pri vate schools supported entirely by fees paid by students and en dowed schools sustained in part by fees and in part by the income from invested funds According to the report of the Commis sioner of Education for I8889 there were in the United States about 725 schools of the first III7 of the second and 207 of the third class The first class is increasing in numbers very rapidly at the expense of the other two Popular interest in the last class has been declining for years though at present it shows signs of a new life It was the prevalent opinion for a time that endowed schools were not necessary but that high schools would take their place Experience has lead some at least to question this view and to hold that endowed schools have still an important function in the educational system As an advocate of this view I wish to make a brief plea in its behalf Endowed schools are needed to maintain a high standard of secondary instruction Such schools as Philips Exeter and Phil 422

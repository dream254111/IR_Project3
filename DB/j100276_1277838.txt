the language used Phillips v Davies 92 N  Y 99 Blair v Blair 82 Kan 464 WILLSDEED IN FORM RESERVING OPERATION UNTIL DEATH OF GRANTOR The appellant executed an instrument in the form of a warranty deed to his son in consideration of his verbal promise that he would care for and support the appellants The instrument was headed Warranty Deed and was referred to in the body of the instrument as a deed and in the acknow ledgement as a deed conveying land to the grantee But in the habendum clause it was provided that the deed is inoperative prior to the death of the appellants This suit is in equity to cancel the instrument the conten tion of the appellants being that it is a will and not a deed and therefore revocable Held that this instrument was not a will but a deed the title to the land passing through the operation of the granting clause but the pos session was reserved to the grantors the appellants during their lives Bill dismissed Sutton et al v Sutton Ark I919 216 S W 1052 Between a deed and a will the following fundamental distinctions are to be noted under the former normally a present interest passes under the latter no interest passes until the death of the testator The former is a completed legal act beyond the power of the grantor to undo the latter is ambulatory 17 MICH L REV 413 In determining whether an instrument is a deed or a will the manifest intention of the party making it as gathered from all the language used in the writing is controlling Jones v Caird I53 Wis 384 Sharp v Hall 86 Ala IIo Phillips v Thomas Lumber Co 94 Ky 445 Bassett v Budlong 77 Mich 338 Wall et al v Wall 30 Miss 91 More over the courts will where they can reasonably do so construe an instrument so as to give it effect and reject a construction which would deprive it of any effect Hunt v Hunt 119 Ky 39 Jones v Caird supra Love v Blauw 6I Kan 496 Wilson v Carrico 140 Ind 533 As would be expected from the indefinite nature of the above methods of construction the authorities are in conflict as to the effect of clauses reserving the operation of such an instrumentas in the principal caseuntil the death of the maker Some cases have held such instruments to be testamentary in character and to be revocable even though delivered and in some recorded Turner v Scott 51 Pa St I26 Bigley v Souvey 45 Mich 370 Hazelton v Reed 46 Kan 73 Murphy v Gabbert I66 Mo 596 Carlton v Cameron 54 Tex 72 On the other hand many cases have held as did the court in the principal case that a present interest in the land passed immediately through the oper ation of the granting clause but the possession and enjoyment were teserved to the grantors by the reservation clause Wilson v Carrico supra Prentico v Hays 75 Kan 76 Hunt v Hunt supra In still another case while they held such an instrument a deed and not a will the court said that it oper ated to create an estate in futuro Abbott v Holway 72 Me 298 And this conflict is still to be found among the later cases some holding that such instruments are wills Thomas v Byrd 112 Miss 692 Cox v Reed 113 Miss 564RECENT IMPORTANT DECISIONS 488 and others holding them to be deeds which pass a present interest and reserve the possession to the grantor for life Shaull v Shaull 182 Ia 770 Lovenskoild v Casas I96 S W 629 and the principal case The reason for the conflict seems to lie in the desire of some courts to adhere to common law rules and strict interpretation Turner v Scott supra and the cases fol lowing it while other courts lean to a liberal interpretation wherever neces sary to uphold the apparent intention of the parties Wilson v Carrico supra and the cases following it Also see I6 MICH L REV 586 I7 MICH L REV 413 and the article by Dean Ballantine supra WILLSNEXT OF KINTIME FOR ASCRTAINING CLASSThe will of the testator settled the residue of his personal estate on his three daughters with cross remainders and provided that on failure of all these trusts such residue should be in trust    for such person or persons as on the failure of such trusts should be his next of kin and entitled to his personal estate under the statutes for the distribution of the personal estates of intestates The trusts failed and it was held that those entitled to take were the next of kin ascer tained at the death of the testator The literal and ordinary meaning of the words next of kin is to be preferred to an artificial meaning derived by supposing that the testator meant those who would have been his next of kin if he had died at the time of the failure of the trusts Carter v Hutchin son 1919 2 Ch 17 Where the class designated to take under the will is described as those then entitled the time for the ascertainment of the class is at the death of the testator and not at the time when the gift is to go over Mortinore v Mortimore L R 4 App Cas 448 Dove v Torr I28 Mass 38 Essentially the same problem is presented and the same result reached when different words of relationship than next of kin are used Holloway v Holloway 5 Ves 399 heirsatlaw Re Nash 71 L T 5 nearest relatives Bullock v Downes 9 H L Cas I relations The fact that the heirs or next of kin are named in the plural and that there is but one person answering that de scription at the testators death does not show that the testator did not in tend the class to be ascertained at that time Ware v Rowland 2 Phil Ch 635 Inr re Trusts of Barbers Will I Sm  G II8 The fact that the dis tribution is to take place on the death of A does not prevent As taking as one of the next of kin Lee v Lee I Dr  Sm 85    it is not suffi cient in order to exclude him to show the absence of a special intention to include him you must show a clear and unambiguous indication of an intention to exclude him Id p 89 Even where words of survivorship are part of the description of the class such as living at the time of the trusts failing or then living are held not to refer to the ascertainment of the class but merely to show which of the class are to take Brook v Whifton 191o I Ch 278 Re Nash supra But see contra Tiffin v Longman 15 Beav 275 Eagles v Le Breton L R 15 Eq I48 The decision in the latter case however was perhaps incorrectly reported Note 71 L T 7 If the clear intent of the testator is to fix the time of ascertainment of the class at 565

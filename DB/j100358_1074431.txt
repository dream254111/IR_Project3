J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1074431,THE SOUTH PAST AND PRESENT,I244513,THE SOUTH PAST AND PRESENT THE SOUTHERN STATES ARE THE RURAL SECTION OF OUR GREAT COUNTRY CONSIDER THE ROLL OF CITIES NEW YORK CHICAGO PHILADELPHIA BROOKLYN WITH THEIR MILLIONS BOSTON ST LOUIS BALTIMORE WITH UPWARD OF HALF A MILLION EACH THE LAST TWO IT IS TRUE BEING BORDER CITIES CINCINNATI SAN FRANCISCO NEW ORLEANS WITH UPWARD OF A QUARTER OF A MILLION SOULS THE LAST BEING THE ONLY DISTINCTIVELY SOUTHERN CITY THAT CAN BE CALLED GREAT AND THAT THE LEAST OF THE TEN AND ONLY IN THE THIRD RANK THEN CONSIDER THE LONG ROLL OF CITIES OF THE FOURTH RANK NUMBERING SAY FROM ONE HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND SOULS PROVIDENCE JERSEY CITY NEWARK PITTSBURG ROCHESTER BUFFALO CLEVELAND DETROIT INDIANAPOLIS MILWAUKEE MIN NEAPOLIS ST PAUL OMAHA DENVER KANSAS CITY LOUISVILLE WASHING TON  THE LAST TWO AGAIN BEING BORDER CITIES IN THIS LIST NO DISTINC TIVELY SOUTHERN NAME OCCURS OF TOWNS OF THE FIFTH RANK  SAY FROM FIFTY TO ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND SOULS SUCH AS CAMBRIDGE LYNN LAWRENCE LOWELL FALL RIVER WORCESTER SPRINGFIELD IN MASSACHUSETTS HART FORD NEW HAVEN BRIDGEPORT IN CONNECTICUTTHE NORTHEASTERN AND NORTHWESTERN STATES CAN BOAST A NUMBER TOO GREAT TO BE ENUMERATED HERE WHEREAS IN THE SOUTHERN WE HAVE IN THIS RANK RICHMOND CHARLESTON ATLANTA NASHVILLE MEMPHIS AND PERHAPS A TOWN OR TWO IN TEXAS  HALF A DOZEN SOUTH TO FORTY OR FIFTY NORTH THESE ARE INTERESTING CONSIDERATIONS AND TO MANY THEY SEEM RATHER CURIOUS AND INTERESTING THAN IMPORTANT BUT IN FACT THE DISTRIBUTION OF POPULATION IS A MATTER OF FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE IT DETERMINES THE CHARACTER OF A CIVILIZATION IT IS THE UNDERPINNING OF HISTORY THE DOMINANT CHARACTERISTIC OF A RURAL DISTRICT IS CONSERVATISM THIS HAS BEEN EXEMPLIFIED IN HISTORY OVER AND OVER AGAIN THE PAGANS AND SURELY IT IS SUPERFLUOUS TO STATE THAT NO REFLECTION IS INTENDED THEY WHO CLAVE INVETERATELY TO THE OLD HEATHEN RELIGIONS WERE COUNTRY PEOPLE AS THE VERY TERM IMPORTS IN RURAL DISTRICTS AND SECLUDED MOUNTAIN VALLEYS HEATHENISM LINGERED FOR CENTURIES AFTER IT HAD BECOME EXTINCT IN THE TOWNS AGAIN IN THE AGE OF THE PROTESTANT REFORMATION THE PARTS OF ENGLAND MOST REMOTE FROM THE CAPITAL  YORKSHIRE NORTHUM BERLAND WESTMORELAND CUMBERLAND DEVON  ADHERED TO THE OLD MEDIAEVAL FAITH ATTER LONDON HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY REFORMED FIFTY 148THE SOUTH PAST AND PRESENT YEARS AGO CLOUGH DESCRIBED BOSTON AS THE PURITAN GREAT MOTHER CITY THE DESCRIPTION IS NO LONGER APPLICABLE BOSTON IS NOT NOW A PURITAN CITY JOHN FISKE HAS LATELY SAID THAT THERE IS MORE PURITANISM IN THE SOUTH TODAY THAN IN NEW ENGLAND AND I CAN TESTIFY TO THE ACCURACY OF THE GENERALIZATION IN THE COURSE OF A WINTER SPENT IN CHARLESTON I WAS STRUCK BY THE SURVIVAL OF OLDFASHIONED LOWCHURCH EVANGELICALISM THERE IN MY COMMUNION I BEHELD THEOLOGICAL TYPES STILL FLOURISHING WHICH UP TO THAT TIME HAD BEEN TO ME PURELY HISTORI CAL THERE IS MORE PURITANISM IN CHARLESTON THAN IN BOSTON IN SOUTH CAROLINA THAN IN MASSACHUSETTS UNTIL THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR SLAVERY WAS KNOWN OF COURSE IN ALL THE COLONIES BUT THE SOUTH CONSERVED THE SYSTEM LONG AFTER IT HAD BEEN ABANDONED BY THE REST OF THE COUNTRY OTHER CAUSES NO DOUBT CON SPIRED TO BRING ABOUT ITS EXTINCTION IN THE NORTH AND ITS PERPETUATION IN THE SOUTH BUT IN THE LAST ANALYSIS I BELIEVE THAT IT WAS NOT ANY CONVICTION AS TO THE BENEFITS OF SLAVERY BUT RATHER THIS INTENSELY CON SERVATIVE SENTIMENT THAT LED THE SOUTH TO CLING TO IT SO DESPERATELY POLITICALLY MOREOVER THE SOUTH JEALOUSLY CONSERVED THE PARTICULARISTIC PRINCIPLE OF THE OLD CONFEDERATION OF I776I789 WHICH WAS OUTGROWN IN THE NORTH AND WEST CERTAINLY AS EARLY AS WEBSTERS DAY AND THE DAWN OF THE WHIG PARTY  SAY BY THE YEAR 1830 FROM THAT TIME THE FEDERAL NATIONAL IDEA WAS UPPERMOST NORTHWARD WHEREAS SOUTHWARD WE SEE THE STATES RIGHTS IDEA PRESERVED FOR ANOTHER GENERATION ALONG WITH ITS ECONOMIC COROLLARY SLAVERY FURTHERMORE IN ITS CULTURE THE OLD SOUTH WAS EXTREMELY CONSERVA TIVE ADDISON POPE AND DR JOHNSON WERE ITS LITERARY STANDARDS COWPER WAS TOO RECENT TO BE CLASSIC FOR HE LIVED AS LATE AS THE YEAR I8OO SHELLEY AND KEATS NOT TO MENTION WORDSWORTH AND TENNY SON WHO WERE STILL LIVINGWERE LITERARY UPSTARTS INCOMPREHENSIBLE AND TO BE IGNORED A DELICATE ILLUSTRATION OF THIS CONSERVATISM OF TASTE OCCURS TO ME IN THE AESTHETIC FIELD THE DEPARTMENT OF FINE ART MOST CHARACTERISTIC OF THE OLD SOUTH WAS WITHOUT DOUBT MINIATURE PAINTING A REFINED ARISTOCRATIC ART THAT FLOURISHED UNDER THE PATRONAGE OF OLD AND WEALTHY FAMILIES AS LATE AS THE YEAR I860 WAS LIVING THE CAROLINA MINIATURE PAINTER CHARLES FRASER WHO CONTINUED UNTIL THE VERY EVE OF THE WAR OF SECESSION THE TRADITIONS OF HIS ART INHERITED FROM THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY AT PRESENT WE ARE ENTERING AN ERA OF PROFOUND AND RAPID CHANGES THE FORCES OF CONSERVATISM ARE GIVING WAY ALL ALONG THE LINE THIS NEW AND UNTRIED SITUATION IS DEPRESSING TO THE CONSERVATIVE THE 149THE SCHOOL REVIEW GROWTH OF REPUBLICANISM THE BIBLE AS LITERATURE GERMAN THEOLOGY THE NEW POETRY REALISTIC FICTION IMPRESSIONIST ART THE NUDE IN ART THE RAGE FOR GYMNASTICS AND ATHLETICS BUT THERE IS NOTHING BUT TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT THE SOUTH IS BEING DRAWN INTO THE CURRENT OF THE WORLDS LIFE THE ECONOMIC EXPLANATION OF THESE PHENOMENA IS A NEW DIS TRIBUTION OF POPULATIONTHE GROWTH OF CITIES LIKE JACKSONVILLE ATLANTA BIRMINGHAM CHATTANOOGA THE A B C OF THE NEW SOUTH KNOXVILLE NASHVILLE MEMPHIS LITTLE ROCK DALLAS HOUSTON AND SAN ANTONIO THE SOUTH IS STILL RELATIVELY THE RURAL SECTION OF THE COUNTRY BUT ABSOLUTELY ITS RISING CITIES ARE GROWING WITH REMARKABLE RAPIDITY AND ARE OFFERING MANY ATTRACTIONS TO RESIDENTS AS IN THE OLD WORLD OUR NORTHEASTERN AND NORTHWESTERN STATES AND AUSTRALIA SO ALSO IN THE SOUTH POPULATION IS GRAVITATING TOWARD THE CITIES THIS MOVEMENT HAS BEEN GREATLY ACCELERATED BY IMPROVED FACILITIES FOR TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATION AND BOTH OF THESE INFLUENCESRAILROAD DEVELOP MENT AND CENTRALIZATION OF POPULATION ARE BRINGING ABOUT AN INDUS TRIAL REVOLUTION AND UPON ALL OF THESE THE NEW CIVILIZATION IS TO BE BASED THE OLD THEOLOGY IS GOING AND WITH IT HAPPILY IS GOING THE SPIRIT OF CONTROVERSY AND IRRATIONAL PREJUDICE THERE IS AN ABATEMENT OF INTOLERANCE A WELCOME INCREASE OF THE SPIRIT OF LIBERALITY IN THEOLOGI CAL CENTERS AND CIRCLES THE WRITINGS OF FOREIGN THINKERS ARE READ AND STUDIED MATTHEW ARNOLD HAS SHOWN US HOW TO USE THE HEBREW SCRIP TURES AS THE LITERATURE OF A PEOPLE AMONG WHOM THE THOUGHT OF RIGHT EOUSNESS OF RIGHT CONDUCT WAS PARAMOUNT IN THE EXTERNALS OF WORSHIP THERE ARE MANY CHANGES IN THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH AN INFUSION OF RITUAL MAY BE NOTED AND IN OTHER RELIGIOUS BODIES A MARKED LITURGI CAL TENDENCY THE MOST REMARKABLE PHENOMENON OF THE HOUR IN SOUTH ERN CULTURE IS THE LITERARY AWAKENING THE HUMANISTIC MOVEMENTA VERITABLE SOUTHERN RENASCENCE UNTIL RECENTLY I MYSELF HAVE PRESIDED FOR SEVERAL YEARS OVER A LITERARY CLUB AT SEWANEE COMPOSED OF A FEW PROFESSORS ADVANCED STUDENTS AND LADIES INTERESTED IN LITERATURE THE CLUB HAS JUST PUBLISHED ITS PAPERS THE RESULT OF LAST YEARS STUDY UNDER THE TITLE MATTHEW ARNOLD AND IHE SPIRIT OF THE AGE AND THIS PUBLICA TION HAS BROUGHT ME FROM ALL OVER THE SOUTH PROGRAMS AND SYLLABI OF SIMILAR CLUBS I WAS AWARE BEFORE OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE MOVEMENT BUT I HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED EVEN TO ASTONISHMENT BY THESE EVIDENCES OF ITS EXTENT AND EARNESTNESS TO THE SUPERFICIAL OBSERVER THIS ENTHUSIASM FOR CULTURE SEEMS SUPERFICIAL AND HE SNEERS AT IT AS ONLY A PASSING  FAD  ACTUALLY IT IS A MOVEMENT THE STRENGTH AND VITALITY OF WHICH I50THE SOUTH PAST AND PRESENT CANNOT BE OVERESTIMATED AND WHICH AFFORDS THE MOST PROMISING OUT LOOK FOR GENERAL CULTURE THAT THE SOUTH HAS EVER SEEN NATURALLY LIKE ALL ENERGY IT IS IN NEED OF GUIDANCE THE BEARING OF THE PRECEDING CONSIDERATIONS UPON OUR EDUCATIONAL PROBLEM MUST BE MANIFEST TO ALL THE POINT IS THAT WE SHOULD PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THE STUDY OF LITERATURE AND TO THE LITERARY ASPECTS OF OUR STUDIES LITERATURE MAY BE DESCRIBED AS THE DEPOSIT OF HUMAN NATURE IN SUCCESSIVE AGES NATIONS AND GENERATIONS HAVE LEFT THIS REOORD OF THEMSELVES AND IT WOULD BE WELL FOR US TO ENTER MORE FULLY AND DEEPLY THAN WE HAVE HITHERTO ENTERED INTO OUR RICH HERITAGE CON SIDER WHAT WE HAVE IN THE LITERATURE OF A RACE OR AN AGE WHAT STIMULUS TO THOUGHT FEELING IMAGINATION ASPIRATION MORAL ENERGY WE HEAR COMPLAINT THAT THE BIBLE IS NO LONGER READ AS IT USED TO BE THE REMEDY FOR THIS DECLINE OF INTEREST HAS ALREADY BEEN POINTED OUT LET IT BE STUDIED AS THE LITERATURE LEGAL HISTORICAL POETIC PHILOSOPHIC ETHICAL RELIGIOUS PROPHETIC OF THE HEBREW RACE AS A GREAT NATIONAL LITERATURE THAT CONTAINS MORE TRUTH ABOUT GOD THAN ANY OTHER AND ITS POWER AND CHARM WILL BE FELT ANEW THE VEXED QUESTION OF THE STUDY OF THE CLASSICS HAS LATELY BEEN BROUGHT AGAIN INTO PROMINENCE BY THE PUBLICATION OF STATIS TICS SHOWING THE DECLINE IN POPULARITY OF THE CLASSICAL COURSES AT HAR VARD UNIVERSITY WHERE OWING TO THE FREEDOM OF THE ELECTIVE SYSTEM SUCH CHANGES OF TASTE AND PREFERENCE ARE SPEEDILY AND CLEARLY REGIS TERED SUCH DECLINE CANNOT BE THE FAULT OF THE CLASSICS THEMSELVES FOR THE HUMAN INTEREST OF THE GREEK AND ROMAN LITERATURES HAS NOT BEEN LESSENED FAR LESS EXHAUSTED BY TIME THEIR POWER TO STIMULATE THOUGHT TO MOVE THE FEELINGS AND THE WILL TO KINDLE THE IMAGINATION IS AS GREAT AS EVER THE FAULT THEREFORE MUST LIE IN THE TEACHERS WHO MUST HAVE NEGLECTED THE LITERARY THAT IS THE HUMANE ASPECT OF THESE STUDIES WE AMERICANS ARE A PRACTICAL PEOPLE WE TEST EVERYTHING BY THE STANDARD OF UTILITY SOME MAY LAMENT THIS FACT BUT IT CANNOT BE HELPED NOR IS IT INDEED TO BE LAMENTED WITH US EYERY STUDY MUST STAND THE TEST OF UTILITY AND ANY THAT FAILS TO MEET THIS DEMAND IS SLOWLY DOOMED NOW WHAT CAN BE MORE USEFUL THAN THE DEVELOPMENT OF PERSONALITY THE ELICITING OF ALL THE POWERS OF OUR COMPLEX NATURE AND THIS IS THE PECULIAR FUNCTION OF LITERATURE WE MAY REST ASSURED THAT THERE WILL BE NO COMPLAINT OF THE INUTILITY OF A STUDY THAT REDOUNDS TO THE EXPANSION OF PERSONALITY OF LIFE EVEN HISTORY MAY BE STUDIED WITH LITERARY REGARD MAY BE MADE TO CONDUCE TO LITERARY APPRECIATION WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES GIBBON MACAULAY AND FROUDE CLASSICS WHILE THEIR CONTEM PORARIES ROBERTSON MITFORD AND FREEMAN ARE RELEGATED TO A LOWER I5THE SCHOOL REVIEW RANK  IT IS THAT THE FORMER CHARM ONE BY THEIR LITERARY STYLETHE ULTIMATE TEST OF A CLASSIC IN THE MODERN LANGUAGES AS WELL AS THE ANCIENT IN TEACHING THE FRENCH OR GERMAN OF OUR SCHOOLS THE LITERARY GOAL SHOULD NEVER BE LOST SIGHT OF AS IT CAN NEVER BE WITHOUT LINGUISTIC LOSS BUT OF ALL NATIONAL LITERATURES ONES OWN HAS MOST POWER OVER THE AFFECTIONS ONES MOTHER TONGUE IS MOST POTENT TO EXCITE IMAGINATION ASPIRATION REFLECTION ACTION HENCE OF ALL AGENCIES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF PERSONALITY ENGLISH LITERATURE IS FOR US THE MOST POTENT CONTAINING AS IT DOES THE WHOLE BODY OF HEBREW AND EARLY CHRISTIAN LITERATURE IN A TRANSLATION THAT HAS NEVER BEEN EXCELLED IF INDEED IT HAS EVER BEEN EQUALED OR APPROACHED IN ITS MARVELOUS RENDERING OF THE SPIRIT OF THE ORIGINAL I WOULD THEREFORE THAT EVERY TEACHER MIGHT BE SATURATED WITH THE SPIRIT OF ENGLISH LITERATURE AND I AM PERSUADED THAT SUCCESS OR FAILURE IN THE PROFESSION MAY BE MEASURED BY THE DEGREE OF ASSIMI LATION OF THAT SPIRIT IN CONCLUSION I HOPE THAT IT MAY NOT SEEM TOO UTOPIAN VISIONARY AND REMOTE TO PUT IN A PLEA FOR AESTHETICS PRIMARILY FOR ATTENTION TO THAT SIDE OF LITERATURE WHICH APPEALS TO THAT OBSCURE BLEND OF FANCY AND FEELING WHICH WE DENOMINATE AESTHETIC HERE IN GENERAL IS OUR MOST GRIEVOUS LACK BOTH IN THE COUNTRY AT LARGE AND IN THE SOUTHERN STATES IN PARTICULAR I WOULD THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE GROWING COMMUNITIES WITH MENTION OF WHICH THIS ADDRESS BEGAN MIGHT APPRECIATE AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE PRESENT OPPORTUNITY WHICH IF LOST CAN NEVER BE RECOV ERED THAT THEY WOULD PROVIDE NOW FOR SYSTEMS OF PARKS AND STATELY AVENUES BORDERED BY SHADE TREES AND ADORNED WITH FOUNTAINS AND STATUES FOR THE SAKE OF UNBORN GENERATIONS THAT THESE COMMERCIAL COMMUNITIES MIGHT BE DIGNIFIED BEAUTIFIED ENNOBLED BY SOME REGARD FOR AESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS AND SO EXERT A MOLDING UPLIFTING AND HUMANIZING INFLUENCE FOR ALL LATER TIME THE FOUNDATIONS OF SUCH AESTHETIC APPRECIATION SHOULD BE LAID IN THE SCHOOLS BUT WHAT CAN BE HOPED AT PRESENT IN THIS DIRECTION FROM THE DREARY UTILITARIANISM SO BLIND TO THE HIGHEST UTILITY OF OUR SCHOOL AND COLLEGE CLASS ROOMS  I WOULD HAVE THESE ROOMS DECORATED WITH A FRIEZE BLAZONED WITH THE MOST FAMOUS NAMES AND UPON THE WALLS WOULD HAVE PICTURES HUNG  PICTURES OF CELEBRATED PLACES AND PERSONS FOR NEGLECT OF WHICH MODERN PHO TOGRAPHY LEAVES ONE WITHOUT EXCUSE UPON SHELVES IN CORNERS OF THE ROOMS I WOULD PLACE VASES AND CASTS CHOICE SPECIMENS OF SCULPTURE AND POTTERY TO REFINE THE SENSE OF FORM AND TO CULTIVATE THE SENSE OF COLOR IN WHICH AMERICANS ARE WOFULLY DEFICIENT WOULD HAVE FLOWERING PLANTS IN THE WINDOWS AND SOME TOUCH OF BRIGHT DRAPERY WHICH BECAUSE IT I52THE SOUTH PAST AND PRESENT I53 WOULD NOT DO TO OBSCURE THE LIGHT FROM THE WINDOWS MIGHT BE RUN ON RODS ACROSS UNSIGHTLY BLACKBOARDS WHEN THESE WERE NOT IN USE SO ONE MIGHT ADD TO THE DIRECT TEACHING OF THE NAMES VIEWS AND LIKENESSES THE INDIRECT AND SILENTLY EDUCATING INFLUENCES OF GOOD TASTE OUR IDEAL SHOULD BE TO BEGIN TO CULTIVATE LITERARY AND AESTHETIC APPRECIATION AMONG CHILDREN AT SCHOOL AND TO DEVELOP THAT APPRECIATION AT COLLEGE SO THAT OUR YOUTH MIGHT BE SENT FORTH THENCE FULLY EDUCATED COMPREHENDING THE NEW SITUATION IN WHICH THEY FIND THEMSELVES EQUAL TO THE TASK AND THE RESPONSIBILITY OF LEADING THE MOVEMENT TOWARD CUL TURE I CONCLUDE WITH A PARAPHRASE OF A WISE SAYING OF AN OLD ROMAN POET  HAPPY IS THE TEACHER WHO UNDERSTANDS THE CAUSES OF THINGS THE NEEDS THE TENDENCY OF THE TIMES FOR HE WILL NOT MAKE MISTAKES GREENOUGH WHITE UNIVERSITY OF THE SOUTH

Dr SCHILFLI Professor of Mathematics in the University of Berne Com municated by ARTHUR CAYLEY FRS Received December 18Read December 18 1862 THE theory of the 27 lines on a surface of the third order is due to Mr CAYLEY and Dr SALMON and the effect as regards the 27 lines of a singular point or points on the surface was first considered by Dr SALMON in the paper  On the triple tangent planes of a surface of the third order Camb and Dub Math Journ vol iv pp 252260 1849 The theory as regards the reality or nonreality of the lines on a general surface of the third order is discussed in Dr SCHLXFLIS paper An attempt to determine the 27 lines c Quart Math Journ vol ii pp 5665 and 110120 This theory is reproduced and developed in the present memoir under the heading I General cubic surface of the third order and twelfth class but the greater part of the memoir relates to the singular forms which are here first completely enumerated and are considered under the headings II III c to XXII viz II Cubic surface with a proper node and therefore of the tenth class c down to XXII Ruled surface of the third order Each of these families is discussed generally that is without regard to reality or nonreality by means of a properly selected canonical form of equation and for the most part or in many instances the reciprocal equation or equation of the surface in planecoordinates is given as also the equation of the Hessian surface and those of the Spinode curve and it is further discussed and divided into species according to the reality or nonreality of its lines and planes The

third class Species XXII 1 2 3AC I General cubic surface or surface of the third order and twelfth class Art 1 As the system of coordinates undergoes various transformations sometimes imaginary ones it becomes necessary to adhere to an invariable system of a real mean ing for instance the usual one of three rectangular coordinates We shall call this the system of fundamental coordinates and define it by the condition that the coordinates of every real point or the ratios of them if they be four in number shall be real Consequently any system of rational and integral equations expressed in variables of a real meaning and where all the coefficients are real will be termed a real system of equations whether there be real solutions or none provided that the number of equa tions do not exceed that of the variables or of the quantities to be determined The degree of the system will be the number of solutions of it when augmented by a suffi cient number of arbitrary linear equations and such degree will generally be the pro duct of the degrees of the single equations It is obvious that the system whenever its degree is odd represents a real continuum of as many dimensions as there are 194DR SCHLAFLI ON SURFACES OF THE THIRD ORDEE independent variables for instance every real quaternary cubic represents a real surface It is known that on the surface of the third order there are 27 lines which form 45 triangles in such manner that through each line there pass five planes meeting the sur face in this line and two other lines or say five triangleplanes Lines not intersecting each other may be termed independent lines as far as a surface of the third order is capable of containing all of them the greatest number of such lines is four that is to say in whatever manner we may choose two three or four not intersecting lines on the surface the system has always the same properties Let two independent lines I and II on the surface be given and imagine any one of the five triangleplanes passing through I then II must intersect one of the two other sides of this triangle in other words this triangle affords a line cutting both I and II and a line cutting I alone Hence it appears that there are five lines cutting both I and II five lines cutting I only five lines cutting II only and ten lines cutting neither I nor IL The theory of the 27 lines depends on the expression of the equation of the surface in the form PQO where P and Q are real or imaginary cubics breaking up into linear factors in fact if the equation be so expressed it is at once seen that each of the planes P0 meets each of the planes QO in a line on the surface so that the form gives at once 9 out of the 27 lines The three planes represented by the equation P0 or QO are termed a Trihedral of the surface Art 2 PBOP It is always possible to find a trihedral represented by a real quaternary cuice The truth of this proposition is evident when all the 27 lines are real But when some of them are imaginary these are conjugate by pairs As the case when two con jugate lines intersect one another is fitter for our purpose we begin with the other case when two conjugate lines do not intersect each other The problem then of finding the five lines intersecting such pair of conjugate lines depends on a real system Hence among the five lines there will be an odd number of real ones and imaginary ones when existing will be conjugate by pairs Call the given two independent and conjugate lines I and II and the five lines intersecting each of them a b c d e If d and e be imaginary and conjugate the plane containing I and d will be conjugate to that containing II and e and these two planes will not intersect in a line of the surface for if they did a line of the surface would unite the intersection of II and d with that of I and e and it is obviously a great loss of generality if three lines of the surface meet in a point But if all the five lines a b c d e be real thenbecause they can be intersected simultaneously only by the lines I and II and because through each of the five lines there passes at least one real triangleplane it must be possible to choose among all the real planes each passing through any one of the real lines a b c d e two real triangleplanes not intersecting in a line of the surface  See Cambridge and Dublin Math Journ vol iv p 118 the original memoirs of Messrs CAYLEY and SALMON on the triple tangentplanes of the cubic surface 2E2 195DR SCHLAFLI ON SURFACES OF THE THIRD ORDER As to the easier case first mentioned when there are on the surface two conjugate lines intersecting each other it is plain at first sight that they afford us four pairs of conjugate triangleplanes not intersecting in a line of the surface Now whether we have two conjugate planes or two real planes not intersecting in a line of the surface the third plane completing them to a trihedral is singly determined by a real system and is therefore real and hence the trihedral is represented by a real cubic Art 3 PROP A real cubic surface of the twelfth class or what is the same thing without nodes can always be represented by uvwxyzO where both uvw and xyz are real cubics breaking up into linearfactors Let AABO be a cubic equation expressed in the fundamental coordinates with real coefficients X a numerical factor imaginary if possible A B cubics each decomposible into linear factors but A real and B imaginary if possible and let  B be respectively conjugate to X B Then XXABBO must be an identical equation and each solution satisfying the system A0 B0 will therefore also satisfy B0 But it would be a loss of generality if through the nine lines in which the two trihedrals A and B intersect each other there should pass a third trihedral B Therefore we must have XX BB in other words if one trihedral of a pair is represented by a real cubic its associate is also so and the trihedralpair equation does not imply any imaginary numerical factor We are therefore justified in asserting that a real cubic surface without nodes can always be exhibited in one of these three trihedralpair forms uvwxyzO 1 u v w x y z are all real 2 u v w x are real y is conjugate to z 3 u x are real v is conjugate to w and y to z Art 4 To save the reader the trouble of consulting my paper in vol ii of the Quarterly Mathematical Journal I will give here a scheme which serves to determine and denote the twentyseven lines In space only four linear functions can be inde pendent any fifth one will be a linear and homogeneous function of these four linear functions Hence it is plain that in the identical equation AuBvCwDxEyFzO the coefficients are linear and homogeneous functions of two arbitrary constants and of course only their ratio is here of importance The identical equation AuBvDxCw DxDxAu EyAu FzABCuvwDEFxyz then suggests the propriety of making the six coefficients subject to the condition ABCDEF because we have then a transformation of the original trihedralpair form into another like form But the condition being a cubic equation has three roots according to which we may put Zau au  bv cwdxey fz O abcdef WauO0 abcdeo y auO abcdeef We denote the line u0 x 0 by ux and so on for all the nine lines arising from 196DR SCHLAFLI ON SURFACES OF THE THIRD ORDER 197 the intersection of the two trihedrals uvw xyz Again since there are twentyseven forms of the equation of the surface such as aubv dxcw  dx  dxaueyaufz 0 the equations audxO bvey0 cwfJz belong to a line of the surface which we denote by 1 while ux ux ux respectively represent the triangleplanes audxO audx0 audx0 and so on Now in the scheme of the nine initial lines x y z u ux uy uz v vx vy vz w wx wy wz we may first perform all the positive permutations of the columns and then deduce from these the negative ones by permuting only y and z In each permutation we keep in view only the lines placed in the principal diagonal We thus obtain the following easily intelligible scheme through ux vy wz pass l 1  1 through ux vz wypass   p  uy vz wx  m m   uzi vy wx      uz vx wy  n n n  uy vx wz  r   The plane ux contains the lines ux I p and so on and the plane containing 1 m n may be represented by Imn and so on I do not think it worth while to show that the equation ABCDEF when explicitly written always has real coefficients and that each of the cases hereafter coming into consideration can be constructed and that it therefore exists Art 5 First caseu v w x y z are all of them real A The cubic condition ABCDEF has three real roots It is then at once plain that all the twentyseven lines and all the fortyfive triangleplanes are real First species I 1 B The cubic condition has but one real root to which let belong the coefficients

SURFACES OF THE THIRD ORDER Art 6 Second casey and z only are imaginary and therefore conjugate A The cubic condition has three real roots Each form changes into its conjugate by merely permuting y and z Therefore in the trihedralpair scheme only the first column contains real lines the two other columns are conjugate and as to the eighteen remaining lines their two schemes are conjugate in the abovementioned order Three lines and thirteen planes are real for there is one real triangle through each side of which there pass besides the plane of the triangle four other real planes Fourth

ordinary node or conical point let us imagine a surface of the nth order with a node at which we are allowed to place the point of reference w Let then an arbitrary line be given through which tangent  As to this mode of expression see footnote to art 8A C0 98Dr SCOLAFLI O SURFACES OF THE THIRD ORDER planes to the surface are to pass and through this line draw the planes of reference z0 through the

P BP BP D0  0 z 0  if none of these equations be a necessary consequence of the other two The node aw then represents two solutions because the equations are respectively of the degrees 2 1 1 or what is the same thing among the tangent planes through the line the plane passing through the node counts for two tangent planes that  P P is the class of the surface is diminished by 2 The exception 0 o   zo is inadmissible for should the plane z0 touch the cone PO the line z0 w 0 would not be arbitrarily chosen The only possible exception is when the three equations bP i P P 0 0 50 can be simultaneously satisfied Consequently so long as the nodal cone P0 does not break up into a pair of planes there are two solutions or the class is diminished by 2 In the excepted case where the nodal cone PO breaks up into a pair of planes we may assume Pxy or Px to be discussed in the sequel and since now the equa tions xyO xO y0 are no longer independent we must go on to consider also Qaz3Lz2MzN where L x y M xy2 N  y3 For the sake of shortness let w1 We then have xyaz3Lz2MzNc 0  SL 2  M aN  Xz z  c 0 and unless the constant a vanishi the system iri the proxiriity of the node reduces itself to xO yO z30 that is to say a biplanar node in general counts for three solutions or diminishes the class by 3 Next it remains to put a0 Laxby when the system becomes x4bz20 yaz O0 xyaxbyz2 KKz 0 199DR SCHLAFLI ON SURFACES OF TUE THIRD ORDER where Kz4 is borrowed from R and the last equation of the system reduces itself by means of the others to Kabzq40 The node here unites four solutions unless Kab should vanish that is to say if the nodal edge x0 y0 lie on the cone Q0 the biplanar node lowers the class of the surface by 4 unless the portion of the surface surrounding the node be in the first approximation represented by the form xbz2yaz2 terms of the fifth order in regard to z 0 The further supposition would be KabO but let us now assume a cubic surface that we may have K0 and therefore abO Selecting the case b0 we put Q axz2 bxe  cy  dy2z N whence xcx2dyz 0 y2az 0 or neglecting higher orders than here come into consideration yaz2 x2adz3 whereby F0 becomes a2dz50 so that the system is reduced to x0 yO a2dz50 That is to say if one of the nodal planes touch the surface along the nodal edge the biplanar node lowers the class of the surface by 5 unless the cone QO have that line of contact either for a double line if aO or for a line of inflexion if dO The exceptional supposition then to be made separates itself into a0 and d0 But a0 would cause all the terms of F to be of the second degree at least in respect to x y so that the surface would have x  y0 for a double line Assuming then d0 we may put Qxz  ax  bxyz  cx3 dxy  exy2 fy3 when the system reduces itself to x0 yO fz60 That is to say if one of the nodal planes osculate the surface along the nodal edge the biplanar node lowers the class by 6 Here we must stop for if we supposef0 the cubic F becomes divisible by x We go on to the case where the nodal cone becomes a pair of coincident planes or say where we have a uniplanar node The equation of the surface is Fx2w ay  3by2z 3cyz2  dz xey2 fyz gz2  2y jz  K  0 6 F For indefinitely small values of  y the equation 0 causes to be of the second order in respect to y z The system of conditions for the point of contact in the proximity of the node of a tangentplane passing through the line z0 w0 reduces itself therefore to x0 ay22byzcz2O ay3 3byz 3cyz2dz30 unless the discriminant of the lastmentioned cubic should vanish Except in this case the system shows that the node counts for six solutions of F0  3F 0  or what is the same thing that a uniplanar node lowers in general the class by 6 But if the binary cubic ay3 3by2z 3cyz2  dy3 contain a squared factor we may denote 200DR SCHLiFLI ON SURFACES OF THE THIRD ORDER this by y2 and then write F w  ayS Ty2z cy2 dyzez2xO for the equation of the surface for it is plain that we are allowed to disregard the subsequent terms divisible by x2 On forming the equation in planecoordinates it is immediately seen that this surface is of the fifth class unless 60 that is in the general case the class is diminished by 7 Lastly if b0 then we have Fx2way3cdyzez2x0 and by forming the equation in planecoordinates the surface would be found to be of the fourth class that is the class of the surface is diminished by 8 A closer discussion of the last two cases is reserved for a fit occasion In the whole we are to distinguish eight kinds of nodes on the cubic surface 1 the proper node which lowers the class by two 2 the biplanar node where the nodal edge does not belong to the surface and which lowers the class by three 3 the biplanar node where a plane different from both nodal planes touches the surface along the nodal edge and which lowers the class bybfour 4 the biplanar node where one of the two nodal planes touches the surface along the nodal edge and which lowers the class byJfve 5 the biplanar node where one nodal plane osculates the surface along the nodal edge and which lowers the class by six 6 the uniplanar node where the nodal plane intersects the surface in three distinct lines and which lowers the class by six 7 the uniplanar node where the nodal plane touches the surface along a line and which lowers the class by seven 8 the uniplanar node where the nodal plane osculates the surface along a line and which lowers the class by eight Art 8 On the case of two nodes on thte cubic surface Let f be the quaternary cubic of the surface P Q the symbols of two different nodes on it then P2f Q2f will identically vanish If now R be the symbol of any third point the symbol caPPQryR where ac 3 y denote arbitrary multipliers will belong to a point in the same plane with the points P Q R and the equation cP j3QyRf 6c3apyPQRf 3y2P PQR2fy3R3f will represent the section of the surface made by the plane Then if the point R satisfy the condition PQRf0 the equation will become divisible by y2 that is to say the equation PQRIf0 in respect to the elements of R represents a plane touching the surface along the line joining the nodes P and Q and besides intersecting it in a line represented by 3sPR2If 3QR fyRR 0O if here a 3 y are regarded as planimetrical coordinates and the point R as fixed In the sequel I shall sometimes term the former line axis

equation of this surface can always be thrown into the form PwQO where P x y z2 Qxy z3 Let I be a linear and homogeneous function of x y z then PwlQlP0O is the same equation But we may in fifteen different ways dispose of the three coeffi cients in 1 so that Q1P breaks up into three linear factors and are therefore allowed to write Zax2by2cz22dyz2ezx2fxyw2xyz0 as an equation of the surface where for the sake of shortness the ternary quadric ax2c of the nodal cone may be denoted by y and the derivatives of 2 by X Y Z Again let Aabcad2be2cf22def Abcd2 Bcae2 Cab6f2 Defad Efdbe Fdecf and determine the constant  by the quadratic equation oaD2 BCO then X2Xyz will break up into two linear factors and  X 2Xyzw2x iwyz will be a trihedral pair form of the surface Its particularity is sufficiently determined by the condition that an edge of one trihedral intersects an edge of the other trihedral the point of intersection being the node I wished only to notice the connexion of such form with the presence of a proper node yet will no longer dwell upon it because I prefer to select hereafter one of those ten trihedralpairs in which no plane passes through the node for investigating by its help the position of the 27 lines Let p q r s denote planecoordinates such that pxqyrzswO shall be the equation in pointcoordinates x yz z w of a tangent plane to the surface 0pO

and so on and all these six pairs of coincident lines pass through the node It may also be observed that they formed in the general case a doublesix and that now the corresponding lines in both sixes also coincide Moreover since the three independent lines 1 mn n in the general case are intersected by each of the three independent lines q r r all these six lines lie in the general case upon a

therefore draw through it three real fundamental planes which call x y z and take the fourth plane at pleasure call it w the equa tion of the surface then is wPQ0 where the functions P Q contain only x y z and therefore represent cones respectively of the second and third orders and it is obvious that as well in P as in Q all the coefficients will be real Hence as to the six nodal rays PO QO all of them may be real or four or two or none So we might distin guish four species of the cubic surface with a single proper node but in the last of the mentioned cases when the node is an isolated point of the surface the cone PO may be real or imaginary Let us therefore distinguish five species First species II 1 All six nodal rays are realThe surface is constructed when we assume six

there are seven real planes to be twice counted each of which passes through the node and one of the seven real simple lines When the two equal roots of the cubic condition separate themselves into real roots the four real nodal rays become eight real lines and the surface changes into the general one of the second species In the other case only the plane passing through the two conjugate nodal

of x y being real or conjugate gives a preliminary view of the biplanar node at the point a A plane turning about its edge x 0 y 0 cuts the surface in a curve with a cusp which changes its direction into the opposite one whenever the turning plane has passed one of the two real nodal planes or always keeps its direction if the nodal planes be conjugate so that in the latter case the surface here terminates in the form of a thorn viz in such a form as is generated by the revolution of a semicubical parabola about the cuspidal tangent The equation of the surface is uvwQO0 where u v are linear functions and Q a cubic one of x y z Denote the three nodal rays uO QO0 by 1 2 3 and the three v0 QO by 4 5 6 Then each combination such as 14 25 36 gives a deter minate position of the plane w0O in virtue of which the cone Q breaks up into three planes Keeping to the order of 1 2 3 and permuting only 4 5 6 we see there are six such transformations But whenever Qxyz the surface contains a simple

respect to the nodal rays are exhausted IV Cubic sztrface of the eighth class with two proper nodes Art 15 From art 8 we already know that the line joining the two nodes or axis unites two and the same rays of each node and that there is a singular tangent plane which touches the surface and therefore also each nodal cone along the axis and besides intersects the surface in a single line which we have termed the transversal Since then besides the axis each nodal cone has four rays not passing through the other node there are in all ten nodal rays which represent twenty lines of the surface considered as though it were general so that there remain only seven simple lines one of which is the transversal above mentioned Because this transversal is not intersected by the eight disengaged nodal rays but only by the axis that is by four lines it must meet all the six other lines and will therefore form with them three triangles Besides such triangle there pass through each of the six lines four other planes which are of course those passing through one or the other node each of them counting for two triangle planes Again a plane through the axis and a disengaged ray of one node must intersect the surface in a third line which cannot but be a disengaged ray of the other node Such plane counts for four triangleplanes for any one of the four disengaged rays of one node since it determines with each of the three remaining rays three triangleplanes must determine with the axis two such planes and because it is made up of two inde pendent lines of the surface the two planes must be twice counted As to the singular tangent plane it counts twice because through the transversal there already pass three simple triangleplanes The surface thus has a line representing four lines viz the axis eight other nodal rays each representing two lines and seven simple lines viz the transversal and the remaining sides of the three simple triangles standing upon it in all 14 48271 27 lines Again the surface has four planes each representing 210DRL SCHLi3FL ON SJURFACES OF THE THIRD ORDER four triangleplanes of the surface viz those passing through the axis and one ray of either node thirteen planes each representing two triangleplanes viz the singular tangent plane and the twice six other planes each of them through two disengaged rays of the same node lastly the three simple triangleplanes passing through the trans versal in all 4A4132 3145 triangleplanes We proceed now to reduce the equation of the surface in question to its simplest form Let xO be the equation of the singular tangentplane and let the plane yO pass through the axis while the planes zO and w 0 touch respectively the nodal cones in lines belonging to the plane yO0 then the term yzw and those divisible by z2 w 2z xw will disappear and we may therefore write xzwy2zwax  4bxs y 6cxy2 4dy3 0 But this cubic if multiplied by x becomes xzy27xw y2  ydxd4 6cd22xy24b  d3xya d4x4 while xzyxz 2dyd2x ydx2 w y2xw2dy  d2y dx2 Now it will be readily seen that the equation of the surface can in but one way be reduced to the form XZW 2  ztZ w  ax3  6x2y  cy2  0 where we might also put unity instead of one of the three constants a b c In respect to the fundamental coordinates the equation implies seventeen constant elements as it should do since the two nodes take away two disposable constants from

quadruple point of the curve the nodal rays at such point being tangents to the curve Art 16 We proceed to determine the lines and triangleplanes of the surface The transversal is x0 zwO The nodal cones are Xzy2O0 Xwy20 besides touching one another along the axis they intersect in a conic the plane of which is zw 0 This plane and the transversal therefore cut the axis harmonically in regard to the two nodes Cutting the surface by the plane y AxO0 and omitting the solution x0 we obtain the equation Z 2XwX2X ax C2  4X2  0 and in order that this break up into factors the condition X4cX2bXa0

single disengaged ray call itf the other nodal plane yO con tains two rays call them g h and the planes combining the former ray with any one of the two latter rays are fg or zx 0 and fh or zx 0 It is manifest that besides the nodal planes and these two planes there pass no other triangleplanes through the node The planes fg and fh intersect the surface respectively in the simple lines zx0 wy0 orj and zx0 wy0 or k Now as a plane containing the node and any distinct and therefore simple line of the surface must be a triangleplane and therefore combine two nodal rays there cannot on all such planes being exhausted be found any other simple line of the surface Hence these distinct linesj and k are the only simple lines of the surface and it is obvious that they do not intersect each other Again since two independent lines are cut by five lines and these lines j and k are simultaneously cut only by the ray f this rayf unites five lines of the general surface and then because each of the simple linesj and k must besides be cut by five more lines each of the nodal rays g and h also unites five lines But all the lines thus far mentioned count as 3521117 lines Therefore the nodal edge or axis unites ten lines of the general surface precisely those ten as we know from art 1 lines disengaged from the two independent lines j and k It is already proved that the two planes passing through the simple lines and the node count each of them as five No one of the five lines united in the rayf intersects ally other of them wherefore no two of them can lie in the same triangleplane But two triangleplanes passing through any one of them have been already spoken of viz fg and fh the three remaining ones must therefore coincide with the nodal plane x0 220DR SCHLAFLI ON SURFACES OF TUE THIRD ORDER hence this plane counts as fifteen The ray g unites the five lines intersectingj but not k the ray h unites the five lines intersecting k but not j and each of the former five lines is as may be inferred from the consideration of a simple triangle cut by four of the latter five which determine with it four different triangles Therefore twenty triangleplanes coincide in the nodal plane

the number h vanish the equation UVWXYZ0 will at the limit exhibit the present surface and the former of the linear relations by reason of the latter counts for three relations answering to the cubic condition Omitting the three accents as in ux and the permutations as in lnn1 we then get the following survey of the manner of coincidence of the 27 lines and 45 triangleplanes of the general surface The axis x 0 y0 unites the ten lines vy 1 p r The nodal rays unite each of them five lines viz the ray x0 z0 unites  zx wz g the ray y0 xz0 unites y vz n the ray y0 xzO0 unites vx wy m and there

remaining planes unite each of them five triangleplanes viz xz0 unites u z uz and xz0 unites w x wx Art 25 In the equation xywxz2y zax30 the vanishing of the constant a would give rise to a second node a Therefore we have here only the two cases when a is positive and when it is negative Since no two of the linear functions x y z zw play a like part in the equation we are obliged to suppose them all real So there are only two species 1 a is positive all is real VII 1 2 a is negative the two simple lines are conjugate and so also the two rays in the nodal plane yO VII 2 VIII Cubic surface of the sixth class with threeproper nzodes Art 26 If we place the points of reference La  w at the three nodes the equa tion of the surface will contain the terms x X2y x2z xw xzw xwy xyz yzw but the last term is capable of taking up the three next preceding terms in other words the three singular tangent planes which touch the surface along the axes or lines joining two nodes may be chosen for the planes y0 z0 w0 then we are at liberty to write x3yzwxayzwO 221BDR SCIILFm ON STURFACES OF TIHE THIRD ORDER as an equation of the surface The term x3 if disappearing would not alter the class but would merely form a particular case of the sort of surface here to be considered which case might readily be restored from the more general form by changing a x respectively into h2 hx dividing by h2 and letting h vanish But the term v2I cannot disappear without bringing the class down tofive for the point a would then become a biplanar node Nor is the constant a allowed to be zero or 4 for in the former case the cubic would be divisible by x2 in the latter it would be half the expression 4Yx2zx 2w x2yx 2zx2w which shows a fourth proper node at the point ja b a a 2axaayzzw If we denote the

in the edge of the biplanar node There is but one species because all four linear functions x y z w must be real XIV 1 XV Cubic surface of thefifth class with a tzniplanar node Art 40 We have seen above that the cubic surface with a uniplanar node can always be represented by an equation of the form x2w PQx where Py z3 Qy z2 and that whenever P has no two equal factors the uniplanar node for itself lowers the class by six but upon considering the case where P has two equal factors it appears that there is a further reduction of one making the whole reduction of class to be equal seven We are here allowed to write Py2z and the equation of the surface accordingly is x2w Y2z ay2  2byz  cZ2  0 or what is the same thing x2cw  acac  b2  2abcy  c2ac  b2z  y  bx2cz  acx  xcz  acx2  0 or simply x2W y2zxzz2  0 where all the variables are necessarily real The equation in planecoordinates arises when the discriminant of 2 qr 2ps 3qsjX y3 is cleared of the factor 42 s hence it is 64p3s2  1 6p2r2  72pq2rs  2 72S  1 6q2r 0 The Hessian of x2wy2zxz2 is 16xI2x y2 Hence the spinode curve breaks up into six times the double nodal ray x0 y0 twice the simple nodal ray x0 z  0 and once the complete curve xz y2 0 x  22 0 which has the node for a 234DR SCiHLAFLI ON STRJFACES OF THE THIRD ORDER double point where the double nodal ray is a tangent common to both branches of the curve Art 41 Denoting by h a number which ultimately vanishes the surface in question may also be represented by the equation 9z  h2Mwz z  hy hy h2z 0 Hence we can see that there is but one simple line zO w0 and that all the ten lines intersecting it coincidein the simple nodal rayx0 z0 while the double nodal ray xO yO unites all the sixteen remaining lines Again the plane zO unites all the five triangleplanes that pass through the only simple line z 0 w 0 and the nodal plane x  unites alone all the forty remaining triangleplanes There is but one species XV 1 XVI Cubic surface of the fourth class with four proper nodes Art 42 If we choose the four nodes as points of reference the equation of the surface necessarily takes the form ayzw bxzw  cxyw  dyz 0 None of the four constants can vanish unless the surface break up into a plane and a quadratic surface We are therefore at liberty to change x y z w respectively into ax by cz dw when the equa tion of the surface becomes yzw w xz

shows a transversal triangleplane xyzw0 which is simple as con taining none of the four nodes Its sides are the transversals of the axes each of them belongs to two opposite axes as for instance xyO zwO being the transversal common to both singular tangent planes xyO and zw 0 The six singular tangent planes lie harmonically in regard to the point xyzw Let any plane pxqy rzsw  0 pass through this

are two species according as x y are real or conjugate As an example of the latter species I may notice the surface generated by a variable circle the diameter whereof is parallel to the axis of a fixed parabola and intercepted between this curve and its tangent at the vertex while the plane of the circle is perpendicular to that of the parabola XIX Cubic surface of the fourth class with a biplanar and a proper node Art 46 Such a surface is represented xywxz2y3O in pointcoordinates and by 64p8s3 4gsr220 in planecoordinates The Hessian of the original cubic is 4xxyw xz2 3y3 whence the spinode curve breaks up into six times the edge x0 yO of the biplanar node and six times the axis y 0 zO joining the two nodes From art 34 it appears that the axis y zO joining the two nodes unites the twelve lines of a double six and that the edge x0 yO unites the fifteen remaining lines 121527 lines Moreover it is plain that the axis unites all six rays of the proper node The nodal plane yO containing the proper node unites the thirty triangleplanes immediately arising from the double six and the osculating nodal plane xO unites all the fifteen remaining triangleplanes 30 1545 triangleplanes The plane z is not fixed for we may also write xyw  2z 2y  Xz  ky2 y3 0 The equation of the surface therefore implies but thirteen disposable constants There is but one species because everything must be real XIX 1 XX Cubic surfrce of the fourth class with a uni planar node Art 47 When in the form x2wP QxO of art 40 P is a perfect cube which we may denote by y3 this equation can be reduced to X2wy3  2 0 The equation reciprocal to this is 274psr22 643s0 Since we may also write the equation in the form x2w 2x X2x y3XtZX2 0 there is nothing to fix the positions of the planes z0 and w 0O and the equation of the surface implies only thirteen disposable constants The Hessian is 48xvy and the spinode curve breaks up into ten times the line x0 yO and once the conic section y0 w  20 along which the cone wz2 0 osculates the surface By the help of a constant h which ultimately vanishes we may represent the surface here considered in the form of art 40 X2x hy 3h3z  h6w  x hi 2X  h2y

triangleplanes in the plane x0 There is but one species XX 1 XXI Cubic surface of the third class with three biplanar nodes Art 48 The equation is xyztw30 in pointcoordinates and 27pgrs30 in plane coordinates The Hessian is 12xyzw hence the spinode curve breaks up into four times the three axes The three axes as counting each for nine lines unite all the twentyseven lines of the surface and this distribution of them into three groups of nine lines answers to a triad of trihedralpairs The plane wt0 of the three nodes counts for twentyseven triangleplanes and each of the singular osculating planes 0 y 0 z 0 counts for six triangleplanes 27  6  66  45 triangleplanes There are two species if x w be supposed to be real according as y z are real or conjugate XXI 1 XXI 2 XXII Ruled surface of the third order and third class Art 49 Let us imagine a continuous system of straight lines forming a surface of the nth order and take at pleasure any one of these lines as an axis about which we turn an intersecting plane The section will then consist of the axis itself and a plane curve of the nlth order which of course intersects the axis in n1 points But of these one alone can move while the n2 remaining intersections must be fixed For the plane cuts an indefinitely near or consecutive straight line of the system in only one point and this alone moves Should any one of the other intersections also move the axis would be a double line of the surface whereas it was taken at hazard Because then the ni2 remaining intersections on the axis are fixed they must arise from a double line of the surface such double line being met by every generating line in n2 points Again to investigate the class of this surface we take an arbitrary line in space it will intersect the surface in n points and therefore meet the same number of generating lines Each plane passing through the arbitrary line and one of these n generating lines will be a tangent plane to the surface And since there are no other tangent planes than such as pass through a generating line therefore the class of the surface is equal to its order Art 50 For n 3 the double line cannot be a curve for else an arbitrary plane section of the surface would have two double points at least and would therefore consist of a straight line and a conic section but this cannot be the case unless the surface break up into a plane and a quadratic surface The double line must therefore be a straight line Again since through any point of it there pass in general two distinct generating lines the plane of these two lines must besides cut the surface in a third line not belonging to the system of generating lines and this will meet all the gene  See Quart Math Journal vol ii p 114 239DR SCHLXFLI ON SURFACES OF THE THIRD ORDER rating lines For if we turn a plane about it the section will always break up into this line itself and a quadratic curve having a double point on the double line of the surface in other words the section will be a triangle whereof the vertex moves along the double line while the two sides are current generating lines and the base rests on a straight line fixed in position which we shall term the transversal It plays the part of the nodecoupledevelope since every plane passing through it touches the surface in two points away from the double line whereas every plane passing through a generating line touches the surface in only one point away from the double line Suppose now that there pass through the double line the planes x0 yO and through the transversal the planes z0 w0 Then the equation of the surface will assume the form MizNw0 and for indefinitely small values of x y this cubic must become of the second order Therefore M N cannot contain  w but must be of the form x y2 whence the equation may also be presented in the form Axa  2Bxy  Cy2 0y where A B C mean homogeneous linear functions of z w If then we inquire for what value of the ratio z w this equation gives two equal values to the ratio x y the corresponding condition ACB2 is of the second degree in respect to the ratio required Hence there lie on the double line only two uniplanar nodest We are allowed to let pass through them respectively the planes z0 w0 But then M N are perfect squares and we are also at liberty to represent them by  y2 2 so that now the equation of the surface becomes X2W yz 0 Since it obviously implies only thirteen constants the existence of a double line counts in the cubic surface for sit conditions The system yx w2z where k is an arbitrary parameter shows the generating line in movement and affords an easy geometrical con struction of the surface which I think it is not necessary to explain The equation reciprocal to w y Iz0 is p2S gq2r0 hence the surface keeps its properties though point and plane be interchanged The Hessian is 16y2 The spinode curve therefore breaks up into eight times the double line and twice the generating lines which pass through the uniplanar nodes and along which the surface is touched by the two singular tangent planes z0 and W0 There are two species according as the two uniplanar nodes are real or conjugate In the first species x y z w are real and whenever the ratio z w is negative the ratio x y becomes lateral In other words when the double line between the two uniplanar  The same thing might also be thus proved Take any four distincet generating lines they will in general not lie on a quadratic surface and because they are already intersected by the straight double line of the surface there will be a second straight line intersecting all of them But since this now has four points in common with the cubic surface it must lie wholly in the surface The problem of drawing through a given generating line a triangleplane is of the fifth degree and it may be foreseen that the plane passing through it and the transversal is a single solution the four remaining soluLtions must all coincide in the plane passing through the given line and the double line t In the language of Dr SALnMON and myself cuspidal pointsA C 240DR SCHLAFLI ON SURFACES OF THE THIRD ORDER nodes is contiguous with the rest of the

for all real values of  gives also real values to the ratio x y The double line is therefore throughout contiguous to the rest of the surface and the two singular tangent planes are conjugate XXII 2 Dr SCHLAFLI has omitted to notice a special form of the ruled surface of the third order which presented itself to me and which I communicated to M CREMONA and Dr SALMON and which is in fact that in which the transversal coincides with the double line For this species say XXII 3 the equation may be taken to be y3XZwyO  see SALMONS Geometry of Three Dimensions pp 378 379 where however in the construction of the surface a necessary condition was by an oversight of mine omitted The correct construction is as follows viz Given a cubic curve having a double point and a line meeting the curve in this point the double line of the surface if on the line we have a series of points and through the line a series of planes corresponding anharmonically to each other and such that to the double point considered as a point of the line there corresponds the plane through one of the tangents at the doublepoint then the line drawn through a point of the double line and in the corresponding plane to meet the cubic generates the surface The special form in question must however have been familiar to M CHASLES as I find it alluded to in the footnote p 188 to a paper by him  Description des

DR SCHILFLI PROFESSOR OF MATHEMATICS IN THE UNIVERSITY OF BERNE COM MUNICATED BY ARTHUR CAYLEY FRS RECEIVED DECEMBER 18READ DECEMBER 18 1862 THE THEORY OF THE 27 LINES ON A SURFACE OF THE THIRD ORDER IS DUE TO MR CAYLEY AND DR SALMON AND THE EFFECT AS REGARDS THE 27 LINES OF A SINGULAR POINT OR POINTS ON THE SURFACE WAS FIRST CONSIDERED BY DR SALMON IN THE PAPER  ON THE TRIPLE TANGENT PLANES OF A

IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO ADHERE TO AN INVARIABLE SYSTEM OF A REAL MEAN ING FOR INSTANCE THE USUAL ONE OF THREE RECTANGULAR COORDINATES WE SHALL CALL THIS THE SYSTEM OF FUNDAMENTAL COORDINATES AND DEFINE IT BY THE CONDITION THAT THE COORDINATES OF EVERY REAL POINT OR THE RATIOS OF THEM IF THEY BE FOUR IN NUMBER SHALL BE REAL CONSEQUENTLY ANY SYSTEM OF RATIONAL AND INTEGRAL EQUATIONS EXPRESSED IN VARIABLES OF A REAL MEANING AND WHERE ALL THE COEFFICIENTS ARE REAL WILL BE TERMED A REAL SYSTEM OF EQUATIONS WHETHER THERE BE REAL SOLUTIONS OR NONE PROVIDED THAT THE NUMBER OF EQUA TIONS DO NOT EXCEED THAT OF THE VARIABLES OR OF THE QUANTITIES TO BE DETERMINED THE DEGREE OF THE SYSTEM WILL BE THE NUMBER OF SOLUTIONS OF IT WHEN AUGMENTED BY A SUFFI CIENT NUMBER OF ARBITRARY LINEAR EQUATIONS AND SUCH DEGREE WILL GENERALLY BE THE PRO DUCT OF THE DEGREES OF THE SINGLE EQUATIONS IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE SYSTEM WHENEVER ITS DEGREE IS ODD REPRESENTS A REAL CONTINUUM OF AS MANY DIMENSIONS AS THERE ARE 194DR SCHLAFLI ON SURFACES OF THE THIRD ORDEE INDEPENDENT VARIABLES FOR INSTANCE EVERY REAL QUATERNARY CUBIC REPRESENTS A REAL SURFACE IT IS KNOWN THAT ON THE SURFACE OF THE THIRD ORDER THERE ARE 27 LINES WHICH FORM 45 TRIANGLES IN SUCH MANNER THAT THROUGH EACH LINE THERE PASS FIVE PLANES MEETING THE SUR FACE IN THIS LINE AND TWO OTHER LINES OR SAY FIVE TRIANGLEPLANES LINES NOT INTERSECTING EACH OTHER MAY BE TERMED INDEPENDENT LINES AS FAR AS A SURFACE OF THE THIRD ORDER IS CAPABLE OF CONTAINING ALL OF THEM THE GREATEST NUMBER OF SUCH LINES IS FOUR THAT IS TO SAY IN WHATEVER MANNER WE MAY CHOOSE TWO THREE OR FOUR NOT INTERSECTING LINES ON THE SURFACE THE SYSTEM HAS ALWAYS THE SAME PROPERTIES LET TWO INDEPENDENT LINES I AND II ON THE SURFACE BE GIVEN AND IMAGINE ANY ONE OF THE FIVE TRIANGLEPLANES PASSING THROUGH I THEN II MUST INTERSECT ONE OF THE TWO OTHER SIDES OF THIS TRIANGLE IN OTHER WORDS THIS TRIANGLE AFFORDS A LINE CUTTING BOTH I AND II AND A LINE CUTTING I ALONE HENCE IT APPEARS THAT THERE ARE FIVE LINES CUTTING BOTH I AND II FIVE LINES CUTTING I ONLY FIVE LINES CUTTING II ONLY AND TEN LINES CUTTING NEITHER I NOR IL THE THEORY OF THE 27 LINES DEPENDS ON THE EXPRESSION OF THE EQUATION OF THE SURFACE IN THE FORM PQO WHERE P AND Q ARE REAL OR IMAGINARY CUBICS BREAKING UP INTO LINEAR FACTORS IN FACT IF THE EQUATION BE SO EXPRESSED IT IS AT ONCE SEEN THAT EACH OF THE PLANES P0 MEETS EACH OF THE PLANES QO IN A LINE ON THE SURFACE SO THAT THE FORM GIVES AT ONCE 9 OUT OF THE 27 LINES THE THREE PLANES REPRESENTED BY THE EQUATION P0 OR QO ARE TERMED A TRIHEDRAL OF THE SURFACE ART 2 PBOP IT IS ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO FIND A TRIHEDRAL REPRESENTED BY A REAL QUATERNARY CUICE THE TRUTH OF THIS PROPOSITION IS EVIDENT WHEN ALL THE 27 LINES ARE REAL BUT WHEN SOME OF THEM ARE IMAGINARY THESE ARE CONJUGATE BY PAIRS AS THE CASE WHEN TWO CON JUGATE LINES INTERSECT ONE ANOTHER IS FITTER FOR OUR PURPOSE WE BEGIN WITH THE OTHER CASE WHEN TWO CONJUGATE LINES DO NOT INTERSECT EACH OTHER THE PROBLEM THEN OF FINDING THE FIVE LINES INTERSECTING SUCH PAIR OF CONJUGATE LINES DEPENDS ON A REAL SYSTEM HENCE AMONG THE FIVE LINES THERE WILL BE AN ODD NUMBER OF REAL ONES AND IMAGINARY ONES WHEN EXISTING WILL BE CONJUGATE BY PAIRS CALL THE GIVEN TWO INDEPENDENT AND CONJUGATE LINES I AND II AND THE FIVE LINES INTERSECTING EACH OF THEM A B C D E IF D AND E BE IMAGINARY AND CONJUGATE THE PLANE CONTAINING I AND D WILL BE CONJUGATE TO THAT CONTAINING II AND E AND THESE TWO PLANES WILL NOT INTERSECT IN A LINE OF THE SURFACE FOR IF THEY DID A LINE OF THE SURFACE WOULD UNITE THE INTERSECTION OF II AND D WITH THAT OF I AND E AND IT IS OBVIOUSLY A GREAT LOSS OF GENERALITY IF THREE LINES OF THE SURFACE MEET IN A POINT BUT IF ALL THE FIVE LINES A B C D E BE REAL THENBECAUSE THEY CAN BE INTERSECTED SIMULTANEOUSLY ONLY BY THE LINES I AND II AND BECAUSE THROUGH EACH OF THE FIVE LINES THERE PASSES AT LEAST ONE REAL TRIANGLEPLANE IT MUST BE POSSIBLE TO CHOOSE AMONG ALL THE REAL PLANES EACH PASSING THROUGH ANY ONE OF THE REAL LINES A B C D E TWO REAL TRIANGLEPLANES NOT INTERSECTING IN A LINE OF THE SURFACE  SEE CAMBRIDGE AND DUBLIN MATH JOURN VOL IV P 118 THE ORIGINAL MEMOIRS OF MESSRS CAYLEY AND SALMON ON THE TRIPLE TANGENTPLANES OF THE CUBIC SURFACE 2E2 195DR SCHLAFLI ON SURFACES OF THE THIRD ORDER AS TO THE EASIER CASE FIRST MENTIONED WHEN THERE ARE ON THE SURFACE TWO CONJUGATE LINES INTERSECTING EACH OTHER IT IS PLAIN AT FIRST SIGHT THAT THEY AFFORD US FOUR PAIRS OF CONJUGATE TRIANGLEPLANES NOT INTERSECTING IN A LINE OF THE SURFACE NOW WHETHER WE HAVE TWO CONJUGATE PLANES OR TWO REAL PLANES NOT INTERSECTING IN A LINE OF THE SURFACE THE THIRD PLANE COMPLETING THEM TO A TRIHEDRAL IS SINGLY DETERMINED BY A REAL SYSTEM AND IS THEREFORE REAL AND HENCE THE TRIHEDRAL IS REPRESENTED BY A REAL CUBIC ART 3 PROP A REAL CUBIC SURFACE OF THE TWELFTH CLASS OR WHAT IS THE SAME THING WITHOUT NODES CAN ALWAYS BE REPRESENTED BY UVWXYZO WHERE BOTH UVW AND XYZ ARE REAL CUBICS BREAKING UP INTO LINEARFACTORS LET AABO BE A CUBIC EQUATION EXPRESSED IN THE FUNDAMENTAL COORDINATES WITH REAL COEFFICIENTS X A NUMERICAL FACTOR IMAGINARY IF POSSIBLE A B CUBICS EACH DECOMPOSIBLE INTO LINEAR FACTORS BUT A REAL AND B IMAGINARY IF POSSIBLE AND LET  B BE RESPECTIVELY CONJUGATE TO X B THEN XXABBO MUST BE AN IDENTICAL EQUATION AND EACH SOLUTION SATISFYING THE SYSTEM A0 B0 WILL THEREFORE ALSO SATISFY B0 BUT IT WOULD BE A LOSS OF GENERALITY IF THROUGH THE NINE LINES IN WHICH THE TWO TRIHEDRALS A AND B INTERSECT EACH OTHER THERE SHOULD PASS A THIRD TRIHEDRAL B THEREFORE WE MUST HAVE XX BB IN OTHER WORDS IF ONE TRIHEDRAL OF A PAIR IS REPRESENTED BY A REAL CUBIC ITS ASSOCIATE IS ALSO SO AND THE TRIHEDRALPAIR EQUATION DOES NOT IMPLY ANY IMAGINARY NUMERICAL FACTOR WE ARE THEREFORE JUSTIFIED IN ASSERTING THAT A REAL CUBIC SURFACE WITHOUT NODES CAN ALWAYS BE EXHIBITED IN ONE OF THESE THREE TRIHEDRALPAIR FORMS UVWXYZO 1 U V W X Y Z ARE ALL REAL 2 U V W X ARE REAL Y IS CONJUGATE TO Z 3 U X ARE REAL V IS CONJUGATE TO W AND Y TO Z ART 4 TO SAVE THE READER THE TROUBLE OF CONSULTING MY PAPER IN VOL II OF THE QUARTERLY MATHEMATICAL JOURNAL I WILL GIVE HERE A SCHEME WHICH SERVES TO DETERMINE AND DENOTE THE TWENTYSEVEN LINES IN SPACE ONLY FOUR LINEAR FUNCTIONS CAN BE INDE PENDENT ANY FIFTH ONE WILL BE A LINEAR AND HOMOGENEOUS FUNCTION OF THESE FOUR LINEAR FUNCTIONS HENCE IT IS PLAIN THAT IN THE IDENTICAL EQUATION AUBVCWDXEYFZO THE COEFFICIENTS ARE LINEAR AND HOMOGENEOUS FUNCTIONS OF TWO ARBITRARY CONSTANTS AND OF COURSE ONLY THEIR RATIO IS HERE OF IMPORTANCE THE IDENTICAL EQUATION AUBVDXCW DXDXAU EYAU FZABCUVWDEFXYZ THEN SUGGESTS THE PROPRIETY OF MAKING THE SIX COEFFICIENTS SUBJECT TO THE CONDITION ABCDEF BECAUSE WE HAVE THEN A

PERMUTATIONS OF THE COLUMNS AND THEN DEDUCE FROM THESE THE NEGATIVE ONES BY PERMUTING ONLY Y AND Z IN EACH PERMUTATION WE KEEP IN VIEW ONLY THE LINES PLACED IN THE PRINCIPAL DIAGONAL WE THUS OBTAIN

DOUBLE LINE OF THE SURFACE SUCH DOUBLE LINE BEING MET BY EVERY GENERATING LINE IN N2 POINTS AGAIN TO INVESTIGATE THE CLASS OF THIS SURFACE WE TAKE AN ARBITRARY LINE IN SPACE IT WILL INTERSECT THE

SPECIES X Y Z W ARE REAL AND WHENEVER THE RATIO Z W IS NEGATIVE THE RATIO X Y BECOMES LATERAL IN OTHER WORDS WHEN THE DOUBLE LINE BETWEEN THE TWO UNIPLANAR  THE SAME THING MIGHT ALSO BE THUS PROVED TAKE ANY FOUR DISTINCET GENERATING LINES THEY WILL IN GENERAL NOT LIE ON A QUADRATIC SURFACE AND BECAUSE THEY ARE ALREADY INTERSECTED BY THE STRAIGHT DOUBLE LINE OF THE SURFACE THERE WILL BE A SECOND STRAIGHT LINE INTERSECTING ALL OF THEM BUT SINCE THIS NOW HAS FOUR POINTS IN COMMON WITH THE CUBIC SURFACE IT MUST LIE WHOLLY IN THE SURFACE THE PROBLEM OF DRAWING THROUGH A GIVEN GENERATING LINE A TRIANGLEPLANE IS OF THE FIFTH DEGREE AND IT MAY BE FORESEEN THAT THE PLANE PASSING THROUGH IT AND THE TRANSVERSAL IS A SINGLE SOLUTION THE FOUR REMAINING SOLULTIONS MUST ALL COINCIDE IN THE PLANE PASSING THROUGH THE GIVEN LINE AND THE DOUBLE LINE T IN THE LANGUAGE OF DR SALNMON AND MYSELF CUSPIDAL POINTSA C 240DR SCHLAFLI ON SURFACES OF THE THIRD ORDER NODES IS CONTIGUOUS WITH THE REST OF THE SURFACE THEN IT IS ISOLATED WITHOUT THEM AND WHEN ISOLATED WITHIN THEN IT IS CONTIGUOUS WITHOUT THE TWO PLANES THROUGH THE TRANS VERSAL AND ONE OF THE UNIPLANAR NODES ARE SINGULAR TANGENT PLANES AND BOTH REAL XXII 1 IN THE SECOND SPECIES WE MAY ASSUME W CONJUGATE TO Z AND Y TO X AND WRITE X  IY2Z IW  IY2Z IW 0 OR WHAT IS THE SAMB THING X2 Y2Z  2XYW  0 WHENCE ARISES THE SYSTEM WZZ X22XXYGY20 WHICH FOR ALL REAL VALUES OF  GIVES ALSO REAL VALUES TO THE RATIO X Y THE DOUBLE LINE IS THEREFORE THROUGHOUT CONTIGUOUS TO THE REST OF THE SURFACE AND THE TWO SINGULAR TANGENT PLANES ARE CONJUGATE XXII 2 DR SCHLAFLI HAS OMITTED TO NOTICE A SPECIAL FORM OF THE RULED SURFACE OF THE THIRD ORDER WHICH PRESENTED ITSELF TO ME AND WHICH I COMMUNICATED TO M CREMONA AND DR SALMON AND WHICH IS IN FACT THAT IN WHICH THE TRANSVERSAL COINCIDES WITH THE DOUBLE LINE FOR THIS SPECIES SAY XXII 3 THE EQUATION MAY BE TAKEN TO BE Y3XZWYO  SEE SALMONS GEOMETRY OF THREE DIMENSIONS PP 378 379 WHERE HOWEVER IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE SURFACE A NECESSARY CONDITION WAS BY AN OVERSIGHT OF MINE OMITTED THE CORRECT CONSTRUCTION IS AS FOLLOWS VIZ GIVEN A CUBIC CURVE HAVING A DOUBLE POINT AND A LINE MEETING THE CURVE IN THIS POINT THE DOUBLE LINE OF THE SURFACE IF ON THE LINE WE HAVE A SERIES OF POINTS AND THROUGH THE LINE A SERIES OF PLANES CORRESPONDING ANHARMONICALLY TO EACH OTHER AND SUCH THAT TO THE DOUBLE POINT CONSIDERED AS A POINT OF THE LINE THERE CORRESPONDS THE PLANE THROUGH ONE OF THE TANGENTS AT THE DOUBLEPOINT THEN THE LINE DRAWN THROUGH A POINT OF THE DOUBLE LINE AND IN THE CORRESPONDING PLANE TO MEET THE CUBIC GENERATES THE SURFACE THE SPECIAL FORM IN QUESTION MUST HOWEVER HAVE BEEN FAMILIAR TO M CHASLES AS I FIND IT ALLUDED TO IN THE FOOTNOTE P 188 TO A PAPER BY HIM  DESCRIPTION DES

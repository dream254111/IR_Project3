Judgment Act One of the most important pieces of legislation affecting the financial system of Greater New York has been the outcome of a controversy between the comptroller and the corporation counsel Inasmuch as the issue raised is one which we find in all the larger cities of the United States its solution cannot help but be of general interest One of the great abuses to which the office of corporation counsel or city solicitor has been put has been to confess judgment in cases of claims against the city thus taking from the financial officers and even from the local legislative assembly the control over expenditures which the theory of our government contemplates In Philadelphia for instance the amount thus drawn from the city treasury without pre vious appropriation often exceeds a million dollars For the year 1899 it was 145955627 The desire on the part of the comptroller of New York city to main tain a strict supervision of the finances of the municipality led him to request of the corporation counsel that before judgment be confessed in any claim against the city there should be a consultation between the two departments In this communication the comptroller points out that during the last two years not one judgment in ten that has been paid out of the city treasury has represented anything but the sole uncontrolled and unchecked action of the corporation counsel who is an appointive and not an elected officer Where judgment is entered by consent or by default or upon offer of judgment the judicial decree represents nothing but the acquiescence of the de fendant In reply to this communication the corporation counsel denied the right of the comptroller to interfere in these matters and refused to follow the suggestion offered As a result the comptroller secured the introduction of two measures in the legislature which have just been passed The first provides that the corporation counsel I Municipal BibliografihiesThe Social Division of the New York State Library has issued a series of reference liststwo of which relate to municipal govern ment which will prove of very great value to investigators in this field Reference List No 6

are of permanent value With a series of reference lists of this character it will be possible to cover the whole field of municipal government and place in the hands of everyone a guide for the study of concrete problems I48NOTErS ON MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT 149 shall not institute any proceedings for acquiring title to real estate by condemnation proceedings except for opening streets unless the same

the mayor shall be also necessary  The second act provides that  all contracts involving an obligation payable from the city treasury for work to be done or supplies to be furnished not made at public letting in the manner provided in sec tion 419 of this act shall be evidenced by orders or requisitions in writing upon forms to be approved by the comptroller signed by the proper head of department

justice of such determination by a proper action at law No claim shall be enforceable at law against the city of New York for work done or supplies furnished not arising out of a contract made at public letting and excepting purchases for contingencies of less than ten dollars unless the same shall have been duly ordered by the proper head of department board officer or commission in the man

claim and when so sworn to answer orally as to any facts relative to the justness of such account or claim150 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY Revision of the City Clharter1 The charter revision commission appointed by the governor under the law passed by the legislature is composed of fifteen citizens of the city appointed to represent the five separate boroughs The chairman of the commission is Mr George L Rives one of the rapid transit commissioners The commission began its work immediately after its appointment A public hearing has been held in each borough at which the views of a number of persons and organizations upon important points involved in the re vision have been presented to the commission Although the com mission has not made any formal declaration of the principle upon which it will work it is very improbable that it will undertake to make any radical changes in the scheme of the present socalled charter That instrument is in form not a charter in any proper sense it is rather a body of ordinances With a charter of this char acter the legislature is called upon to act in large measure as the local lawmaking body of the city Indeed the chairman of the senate committee on affairs of cities complained last winter that his commit tee was in effect a board of aldermen for the city of New York The organization of citizens more particularly interested in the revision of the charter is the City Club While that body has not yet formulated all the suggestions which it will make before the commis sion it may be said that there is a widespread feeling that it is hardly worth while to expend a great amount of vitality upon the patching of the present hopelessly defective instrument It is proposed that a special committee of the City Club composed of members of the club having special knowledge of the subject shall formulate suggestions as to the amendment of that part of the charter relating to the depart ment of education This subject needs very careful attention and is to a great extent separable from the rest of the charter The club has under consideration other important subjects such as propor tional representation and the administration of the tax department It has urged upon the commission I that the mayors power of re moval now limited to the first six months of his term should be extended throughout his term 2 that the Municipal Assembly now composed of two houses should consist of a single house probably elected by a system of proportional representation and that in any case at least some of the members should be elected otherwise than by the present method of returning one member from each separate district 3 that the charter should provide for municipal ownership and con trol of water supply and water front 4 that the police department should be under a single commissioner in place of the socalled bi I Communication of James W Pryor Esq Secretary of City Club New York CityNOTES ON MUNICIPAIL GOVERNMENT 15I partisan board of four members and that the bureau of elections should be separated from the department The views of the City Club as to the time expenditure necessary for a satisfactory revision of the charter not having been met in the law under which the commission acts the disposition of the club is to believe that however industri ous and intelligent the commission may be it can do only very imper fect work under the conditions imposed upon it City Officials and the American Ice Company During May in teresting developments took place tending to show that the mayor and other city officials as well as leading Tammany men not holding municipal office were interested largely in the American Ice Com pany a corporation doing business with many of the city depart ments and depending in large measure upon the favor of the dock department for the necessary facilities for introducing its ice into the city The attorneygeneral of the state has instituted proceedings to revoke the certificate of the ice company to do business in this state and under a section of the charter of the city a special inquiry as to the connection of municipal officers with the ice company is in progress before a supreme court judge PennsylvaniaBallot ReformThe Union Committee I for the Promotion of Ballot Reform and the Merit System in Pennsylvania has been formed by representatives from the Pennsylvania Ballot Reform Association the Civil Service Reform Association of Pennsylvania and the Municipal League of Philadelphia to undertake the work of appealing to the friends of honest government in the state to organize and conduct a nonpartisan educational campaign in behalf of these two objects Already a large number of petitions have been circulated and signed and a large quantity of literature has been prepared set ting forth the urgent necessity for the introduction of ballot reform and the merit system in Pennsylvania A representative of the Com mittee has been working in various parts of the State and thus far two auxiliary committees have been organized one in Pittsburg and one in Scranton Both of these committees are the outgrowth of the work of the field representative They represent the business and profes sional elements of the community It is the expectation of the Com mittee that similar work will be done in other parts of the state so that by the time the Legislature convenes in January i901 there will be a chain of auxiliary organizations all pledged to active coopera tion One of its leaflets dealing with ballot reform sets out

an adequate personal registration law and an uptodate election code Convention oJ Cities of the Third Class For some years the cities of the third class of the State of Pennsylvania have been endeavoring to secure amendments to the Corporation Act under which they are organized Under the present system of classifica tion in the State of Pennsylvania all cities with a population be tween ten thousand and one hundred thousand are included in the third class The great difficulty has therefore been to bring about united action by such cities owing to the impossibility of reaching an agreement on the needs of cities of such different size Those cities like Scranton with a population of eighty thousand or over require a form of organization far too complex for a small town like York and conversely the simplicityof organization adapted to the smaller towns is illadapted to meet the needs of the larger Partly owing to this fact and partly owing to the lack of concentrated action on the part of all the cities of the third class no legislation has as yet been secured Some months ago the mayors of several of the larger cities determined to call a convention for the purpose of forming a perma nent organization of the cities of the third class in order to secure the necessary legislation A call was sent for a convention at York to be held on the 15th of May To this convention each of the twentyfive cities of the third class sent as representatives the mayor the city solicitor and two members of each branch of councils At this con vention a permanent organization was effected The work of the convention was outlined in an address by Professor L S Rowe of the University of Pennsylvania in which the following recommendations were made for the consideration of the convention x The present system of classification is illadapted to the require ments of cities of the third class in that it links together cities of such diverse needs The division should be as follows  First ClassCities with a population of over 250ooo Second ClassCities with a population of from 50oo000 to 250000 Third classCities with a population of less than 50000 2 The divided local representative assembly while justified in the national and state governments has no place in the muni cipality There should be but one branch of councils one half of the members elected on the district system the other half at largeNOTES ON MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT 153 3 The appointments of the mayor should not be subject to the advice and consent of select councils This is necessary to enforce political responsibility 4 Police Department In cities with a population of fifty thousand 50000 and over a department of police with a commis sioner appointed by the mayor should be established subject to civil service regulations formulated in law The power of appointing members of the police force should be vested in the commissioner 5 The power of the city controller should be enlarged 6 The granting of franchises should be subject to the following conditions  a Limitation of term to twentyfive 25 years b Return to the city should be based on gross receipts c Accounts should be kept in accordance with forms presented by the city comptroller 7 There should be some provision for uniformity of accounting of cities of the third class These recommendations were made the basis for the discussions of the convention The outlook for the securing of remedial legislation is most favorable owing to the concerted action of the cities most interested Pennsylvania Sanitary Convention The eleventh state sanitary convention of Pennsylvania was held at Mechanicsburg May 2325 The session was principally devoted to the discussion of the various phases of rural sanitation The papers agreed that rural sanitation today is as unsatisfactory as when the State Board of Health was established Dairies are unsanitary school houses are badly located lighted and ventilated rivers and wells are constantly polluted as is testified annually by typhoid in 500 towns the dead are buried with out any record statistics of births sickness and mortality are want ing infection is neither prevented nor controlled The representatives from Allentown Norristown Shenandoah Phcenixville Lancaster and McKeesport testified that cases of typhoid diphtheria and scarlet fever were traced to suburbs and townships without boards of health All united in declaring that the pressing need today is effectual rural sanitation that the safety of cities is constantly menaced by the ex isting laxness and that the present administrative machinery is not capable of enforcing sanitary law in rural districts Various suggestions were triade looking towards a reorganization of the state sanitary service In the past the legislature has attempted to correct evils by creating additional inefficient machinery or by 1 Communication of Dr Winm H Allen of the University of Pennsylvania154 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY giving additional power to boards which made no pretense of activity The state veterinarian urged the necessity of regular inspection of dairies and the publication of results as is now practiced at Williams port and Meadville It was claimed by various health officers that the cities could not afford to inspect all of the dairies it was also urged that not one town in a hundred would institute such inspection Therefore the establishment of county or state inspection was de manded As a result of the conference the following changes were recom mended for the consideration of the committee on legislation The substitution of state for local authority and to that end the establish ment of a state bureau of health with a superintendent and an advisory board the districting of the state for inspection and adminis tration at the expense of the state displacement of the board system by executive officers the substitution of compensated service and notification for volunteer service and notification of infection the regulation of state aid to hospitals so that the erection of fever hos pitals will be encouraged the substitution of the county for the borough and school district as units of administration and the estab lishment of a bureau of vital statistics No better proof is needed of the necessity of such fundamental changes as here suggested than the fact that only thirty out of three thousand sanitary administrative units were represented in the con vention PittsburgCivil Service At the last session of the Legislature the Director of the Department of Public Safety obtained the passage of a law enabling him to introduce a system of competitive examina tions to govern appointments to the fire department and the police force The first report of the police bureau since the introduction of the system has been presented to city councils The superintendent of police says  We have no hesitation whatever in saying that the system will result in great good to the bureau from the fact that it very largely eliminates politics and places men on merit for appoint ments Experience of the year has taught us that fully 50 per cent of applicants fail on physical examination and of the remaining num ber possibly 25 per cent fail on the mental examination thereby raising the force to a higher physical and mental standard It is to be noted that the introduction of this reform was not due to the pressure of outside sentiment but to the personal initiative of the head of the department who is thus strongly interested in seeing that the system is fairly worked The success of the system in improving the per sonnel of the police force tends to promote the extension of it to other departments of the city government Communication of Henry Jones Ford Esq Pittsburg PaNOTES ON MUNICIPAL G4OVERNMENT 155 The act by which the system of competitive examinations was intro duced is a general law applicable to cities of the second class It therefore applies to Allegheny City which is also a city of the second class but it has not been put into effect there Mayor James G Wyman of Allegheny City is now taking steps to establish a civil service commission and put the law into operation Mayor Wyman and the Director of Public Safety in that city are chiefs of opposing political factions and the mayors present interest in civil service reform is ascribed by his opponents to his hostility to the director but this if true illustrates the way in which competition of political factions for public favor promotes reform movements Party Politics and Governmental Forms The case of Pittsburg and Allegheny are particularly interesting to students of municipal gov ernment from the evidence they afford of the fact that governmental character is determined not by charter forms themselves but by the functional activities developed under them The two cities are adjacent separated only by the Allegheny River and their population is the same in general character Indeed the two cities constitute one busi ness and social community They have the same form of government and yet they differ widely in the general character and tendencies of their government In both the heads of departments are elected by the councils while the mayor is chosen by popular election but in Allegheny there is a chronic opposition between the mayor and the department chief controlling the police and fire service while in Pitts burg harmonious cooperation is the rule During a recent contest over the nomination of legislative candidates in an Allegheny district the mayor and the department chief were antagonistic faction leaders each accusing the other of abusing his official authority for partisan purposes In an altercation upon the city hall steps the mayor was knocked down by a captain of police who although temporarily sus pended was exonerated and restored to his duties In Pittsburg the character of the men chosen to high office and the tone of official pro priety which prevails make such an occurrence impossible The cause of tht remarkable difference which exists is to be found in political usage In Pittsburg mayors are nominated by conventions of delegates acting under the instruction and advice of party man agers whose influence also guides councils in electing the heads of departments and in this way administrative unity is obtained In Allegheny the mayor is nominated by the direct vote of the people and in the canvass party lines are effaced The contest excites intense popular interest and brings out such a heavy vote that the total poll exceeds even that at a presidential election It has been found in practice that no one can be elected except a candidate of the kind the156 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY politicians call  a mixer a mah who goes from saloon to saloon and other places of popular resort shaking hands treating and making friends by being a good fellow Under these circumstances it has happened that a man whose term as mayor was cut short by a convic tion for malfeasance and a term of imprisonment obtained a reelec tion by active personal canvass on the platform give a man a chance to show that he can do right It may be unpleasant to consider such facts but they certainly deserve consideration Bostonifayors AMessage The inaugural address of Mr Hart of Boston contains a review of the work of the several departments during the year 1899 This review shows very clearly the growth of the Metropolitan District System which is making Boston a part of a larger municipal unit for the performance of the more local important services There is at present a Metropolitan Park District a Metro politan Water District and a Metropolitan Sewerage District The latest of these developments is the Metropolitan Water System which was taken over by the Metropolitan Water Board on the first of Janu ary 1898 Since that time the expenditures of the board have been nearly twelve million dollars Annual assessments are made upon the various cities and towns of the metropolitan districts to defray the costs of maintenance and interest on the debt and for the estab lishment of a sinking fund to pay the principal of the indebtedness incurred when the loans authorized by the commonwealth shall mature Bostons proportion of total assessment was 8339 per cent in 1898 and 8237 per cent in 1899 It is the opinion of the board that the annual cost of water to all the different parts of the Metropolitan Water District will be materially decreased by the establishment of the Metropolitan water works and that the water rates in Boston as well as to the other cities and towns may be considerably reduced in the future Local Taxation During the past year there has been considerable agitation for the revision of the state law relating to the taxation and indebtedness of the city of Boston An interesting communication to the Boston Real Estate Exchange by the Hon Nathan Matthews Jr formerly mayor of the city reviews the local financial situation and makes the following recommendations I To repeal authority given to the city but not yet exercised to borrow money outside of the debt limit 2 To raise the debt limit to 2Y per cent in order to enable the city to finish the work already begun under authority to borrow outside of the debt limit 3 To provide that all suburban streets not exceeding fifty feet in width shall be built upon the assessment planNOTES ON MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT 157 4 That no loan for improving sidewalks or any other form of street construction shall be for longer than ten years thus making reason ably sure that the work will survive the loan 5 To repeal the law making an independent government of the school committee and give the mayor power to appoint both the members of the school committee reduced perhaps in number and the members of the board of street commissioners 6 To prohibit the borrowing of money to pay interest and sinking fund requirements 7 To prohibit the borrowing of money for the extension of the citys water mains 8 To leave the tax limit as it is at present namely nine in a thou sand of the average valuation for the five preceding years for both city and county purposes CincinnatiLegislation Affecting the City The legislature which adjourned on April 16 19oo enacted few general laws of special benefit to the good government of the city The municipal code which was supported by all friends of good government was defeated Two years hence another effort in this direction will be madethen it is to be hoped that separate measures for civil service for ballot reform and federal system of government will be introduced instead of embody ing all in one measure The most important piece of legislation was the annexation bill In accordance with its provision an ordinance was passed providing for the annexation to the city of many villages and hamlets having a population of about twentyfive thousand and a tax valuation of 20oooooo This was to have been submitted on May 29 1900oo to a vote of the citizens of the city and the district proposed to be annexed but in the interval the several villages antici pating annexation entered upon all sorts of wildcat schemes of public improvement and franchise granting Many hundred thousand dollars of bonds were issued most of them to be sold before the election and many valuable franchises were granted to speculators Public opinion soon changed and on May 21 the board of legislation repealed the annexation ordinance Cincinnati will therefore not enjoy the title  Greater Cincinnati  in time for the I1oo census It is possible that if the villages recall their bond issues and can procure a surrender of their grants that annexation may yet be accomplished Omaha2Collection of Personal Taxes One of the agreeable surprises resulting from a change in the personnel of city officials incident to the recent municipal election is the policy of the new city treasurer in undertaking a literal enforcement of the law relative to the tax on personal property This tax has generally been a farce 1 Communication of Max B May Esq of Cincinnati 2 Communication of Charles S Lobingier of the Omaha Bar158 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY not only in Omaha but throughout Nebraska The subject of taxation is easily hidden from the assessor or moved from one county to another and the steps taken to enforce even the partial and imperfect levy thus made have usually been halfhearted and ineffectual The conse quence has been that a large portion of personalty has always escaped taxation while in Omaha the payment of such taxes has been the exception rather than the rule the whole system degenerating into one of voluntary contribution by the taxpayer The question of reform in this direction has for some time engaged the attention of the Commercial Club and the present city treasurer upon assuming the duties of office declared it to be a part of his policy to attempt in earnest the collection of personal taxes In carrying out this policy he pro ceeded to revive and put in practice the provisions of an almost ob solete statute which reenacts the antiquated common law remedy of distress and authorizes the treasurer to distrain or seize without judi cial process the personal property of the delinquent taxpayer In one case a dilatory citizen whose unpaid personal taxes amounted to about Iooo found himself bereft of valuable household furniture which was taken and sold by the agents of the treasurer In another instance a local merchant whose debt to the city for the same item was in the neighborhood of 6oo found himself confronted with the alternative of paying this amount or having a portion of his stock seized and chose the former So effective have been such examples that other delinquents have hastened to settle their accounts with the city and on the single day of May 24 the payment of back personal taxes reached the unprecedented figure of more than 2ooo a fact whose significance will be understood when it is stated that this tax in the case of the average citizen amounts usually to less than 50o Some interesting legal questions have arisen in connection with this new policy of enforcing the tax law and several suits have already been started to test the legality of the method It has been urged that the statute authorizing the remedy of distress or distraint which is wholly summary and prevents a resort to the courts is an infringement of that section of the Bill of Rights which prohibits the taking of private property  without due process of law In Ken tucky however where the constitution contains a similar clause the court of appeals has recently rejected this contention In Garnett v Jennings Ky 1898 44 S W Rep 382 the validity of a statute authorizing a landlord to distrain for rent which was precisely the scope of the common law remedy was in question and the court said  It is further objected by appellants that the whole law of distress is contrary to and in conflict with both the federal and state consti tutions as depriving the tenant of his property without due process of law But the words  due process of law  do not necessarily implyNOTES ON MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT 159 a trial by jury as seems to be contended on behalf of appellants The better and larger definition of  due process of law  is that it means law in its regular course of administration through courts of justice 2 Kent Com 13 The words were intended to have the same meaning as the words by the law of the land in Magna Charta Murray v Improvement Co 18 How 276 But the remedy of the landlord by distress was in existence at the time of the adop tion of the constitution though greatly modified in the more oppres sive features which appertained to it at the common law It would seem that this language is a fortiori applicable to the Nebraska statute since the latter was designed to aid the state in the exercise of its taxing power and was not like the Kentucky statute merely a provision for determining controversies between private citizens HavanaFinancial Condition of the City The report of the Havana Finance Commission appointed by the military governor of Havana contains a large number of important recommendations for the reorganization of the financial system of the city The principal items of income taking the average of the last ten years were as follows i From property owned by the city a Water rents   272 oo000 oo b Markets  145000 00 c Slaughter houses   138ooo oo 2 From direct taxes a Tax on consumption of meat  676coo oo b Tax on city and rural real estate   igoooo oo c Industrial tax on persons and indus tries  238000 oooo 3 Miscellaneous receipts Amounting to about    166ooo oo When American rule replaced Spanish dominion the anomalies of the financial situation were so numerous that nothing short of com plete reorganization would meet the needs of the situation The finance committee made a very thorough study of the system of taxa tion the sources of revenue other than taxation and the financial management of the various public works It found a series of mo nopolies which had been granted under Spanish rule and which pre vented the readjustment of the system upon a sound basis The most important of these monopolies was the right of carrying dressed beef from the slaughter houses to the butcher shops which had been granted in 1706 to the high constable of the city of Havana as partial payment for the services which he rendered in that office A fee ofi6o ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY fifty cents for each carcass was charged for such transportation which netted a handsome revenue to the state The commission recom mended that the city assume charge of the cartage of meat and that the price be reduced to twentyfive or thirty cents per carcass This was done by the military governor but appeal was taken to the Gov ernment at Washington by the owners of the monopoly and the mAtter has not as yet been definitely decided Another change which was made immediately after the establish ment of American military rule was the abolition of the tax on meat The commission recommends furthermore I A change in the system of water rents so as to bear less heavily upon the poor of the city and more equitably upon the wealthy residents and upon hotels factories etc and that a special meter service be adopted for hotels factories baths and other industrial enterprises 2 The abolition of the state tax on improved city real estate 3 The establishment of the tax on docks 4 The reduction of the fees for the registry of property transfers The commission is still continuing its work which will require some months for completion FOREIGN CITIES London The Housing of the Poor During the last ten years the cities of Great Britain have undertaken to improve the housing con ditions of the working classes through the destruction of insanitary areas and the construction of model dwellings of both the tenement and single house type The Annual Report of the Housing of the Working Classes Committee of the London County Council contains a record of the work of the county council during the year ending March 31 1899 Under the act of 1890 the administrative authorities of London are empowered to undertake four different classes of improvements First The county council after sanction by the secretary of state and parliament may carry out plans for the improvement of insanitary areas which are of such size as to be of general importance to the whole country In any such scheme it is essential that dwellings should be provided on the area dealt with for at least half the persons displaced Second The constituent vestries and district boards which exercise administrative authority over portions of the present administrative County of London may institute proceedings before a magistrate for the closing and demolition of single houses which are unfit for human habitation Sections 39 and 46 of the act enable the vestries and dis trict boards and the county council either in conjunction or otherNoTr ON MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT 16 I wise to undertake schemes for the improvement of areas which are too small to be of general importance to the whole county In any such scheme it is not essential that dwelling accommodations for the persons displaced should be provided Third Part III of the of the act enablesthe county council to pur chase by agreement or with the consent of the secretary of state and parliament by compulsion houses for the accommodations of persons of the working class or land for the erection of such houses In addition to these powers the vestries and district boards may obtain the closing and demolition of insanitary habitations by proceed ings before a magistrate under the Public Health Act of 1891 The pressing need for housing accommodations led to a series of investigations as to the possibility of erecting model tenements in dif ferent portions of the County of London The county council adopted the principle that housing accommodations should be provided for a number of persons equal to those displaced by any improvement but that such accommodations need not necessarily be in the immediate neighborhood of the improvement The most important work carried out during the year 189899 was the completion of what is known as the Boundary Street Improvement Three blocks of dwellings cost ing nearly 200000 were erected on an area which had been covered with the worst type of slum tenements Less than half of the area was used for building purposes the remainder being devoted to wid ening of the streets and the construction of a public square The building erected contained accommodations for 808 persons in tene ments of six rooms 9 of four rooms 74 of three rooms and 67 of two rooms Five other blocks of tenements have been begun The total cost of each will be nearly 4ooooo They will provide accommodation for 1636 persons in selfcontained tenements of which one is of five rooms ten of four rooms 117 of three rooms and 211 of two rooms The number of persons who were displaced in this area was 5719 Under the plan approved by parliament the county council was required to provide accommodation for not less than 4700 persons As a matter of fact rehousing conditions had been planned for 5524 which is only 195 less than the number displaced and 824 more than the scheme requires In addition to this 18 stores and 77 workshops have been provided The 5524 persons will be accommodated in Io69 tenements making an average of 5168 persons per tenement The distribution of these tenements are as follows Oneroom tene ments 15 tworoom tenements 541 threeroom tenements 4oo four room tenements 1o3 fiveroom tenements 7 sixroom tenements 3 In its report the committee says 1 The buildings are so arranged that nearly every room commands a pleasant outlook Every habit able room enjoys a fortyfivedegree angle of light both horizontally162 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY and vertically The entrance avenue is sixty feet and the principal streets fifty feet wide All of these will eventually be paved with asphalt The paving of the streets on the northern half of the area is nearly completed while that of those on the southeastern portion is in progress The cost of these paving works will be about sixtyfive thousand dollars There are three public gardens of an aggregate area of nearly Lhreefourths of an acre Washing accommodation is only provided in two of the blocks For the remainder a central laundry has been built containing 42 troughs 42 drying horses 3 cen trifugal wringing machines 3 box mangles and I roller mangle Behind the laundry is a small annex containing 12 hot and cold slipperbaths and I cold showerbath and over the laundry are two clubrooms for the use of the tenants Interest and sinking fund upon the capital cost of this laundry form a charge upon the various buildings A general bakery is also provided on the area During the progress of the reconstruction of the area the cost of building has consider ably increased The London Building Act 1894 has increased the thickness of walls changed the slope of the roof etc From May to July 1896 the wages of all the skilled trades were in creased one cent per hour and this was followed on the first of June 1897 by a similar increase in the wages of the laborers The cost of materials has risen very considerably especially bricks Port land cement steel joists slates lead and zinc Further increases may be anticipated from the Workmens Compensation Act and the new drainage bylaws In spite of this however it is anticipated that after payment of interest on the capital at 3 per cent and provision for a sinking fund to replace the cost of land and buildings within terms varying from fiftytwo to sixty years no charge upon the county rate will be involved The dwellings are at present managed by a superintendent who is in direct communication with the valuers office and who is assisted by caretakers These latter occupy their tenements rent free and have an allowance of gas and generally a small weekly payment in addition The rents are collected by col lectors in the comptrollers department and on a rent roll of 6o 16997 for the past year the loss of rent amounts only to 36598 or 6 per cent The committee have under consideration the question of the possibility of more economical management by a closer combination of the various duties required and hope shortly to be able to report on the matter Drainage The annual report of the Main Drainage Committee of the London County Council gives some interesting facts concerning experiments with sewage filtration During the past year the commit tee has been conducting investigations into the practicability of treating the sewage of the metropolis by means of filtration through coke beds In speaking of the plan the committee says  Such system is reallyNOTES ON MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT 163 in vogue in many of the large provincial towns but as London sewage is of a special character containing manufacturing refuse of greatly varied descriptions in addition to the ordinary house drainage consider able experience has to be obtained as to the best method of construct ing the cokebeds and as to the quantity of sewage that can be dealt with without causing foulness in the filter Small experimental coke and Kentish ragstone filters varying in depth from four feet to twelve feet have been in use for some time at the Barking and Crossness outfall works and a portion of the filtrate is subjected to a second process of filtration The results hitherto obtained show that the filters can remove the whole of the suspended matter from the crude sewage as well as over 50 per cent of the dissolved oxidizable and putrescible matters The filtrate thus produced remains free from objectionable odor when it is kept in open or closed vessels provided the bacteria present in it are not removed or killed by special sub sequent treatment Gold fish and dace have lived for months in the first filtrate from the coke beds and it is believed that they would live and thrive in this liquid for an indefinite period One of the main objects in view in conducting these filtration experirt ants has been to ascertain the effect of filtration on the number and nature of the bacteria present in the raw sewage and the services of a bacteri ologist have therefore been retained for a further period to make the necessary investigation Dr A C Houston who has been engaged for this work has already issued a report dealing with the number and kind of bacteria in the sewage as it arrives at Barking and Cross ness Dr Clowes the councils chief chemist has also in conjunc tion with Dr Houston prepared a further report on the whole of the experiments and the results obtained both from a chemical and bacteriological aspect are fully dealt with So far the bacteriologi cal examination of the filtrate goes to show that filtration through coke does not by any means remove the bacteria from the crude sewage and does not materially reduce the number The presence of many of the bacteria in the effluent is found to be not only unob jectionable but necessary for the purpose of completing the purifica tion of the effluent after it has flowed into the river  Parks and Open Spaces The report of the Committee on Parks and Open Spaces contains a review of the development of the park sys tem of London In 189o the number of park and open spaces under the direct administration of the county council was 40 in 1899 the number had increased to 89 The acreage had increased from 2656 in 1890 to 3751 in 1899 This does not include that portion of the park system under the control of the district and vestry boards which is the most important part of the whole system During the year nearly 40oooo was expended for concerts in these parks

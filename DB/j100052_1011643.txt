EXCHANGES OF MINNEAPOLIS DULUTH KANSAS CITY MO OMAHA BUFFALO PHILADELPHIA MILWAUKEE AND TOLEDO1 THE MINNEAPOLIS CHAMBER OF COMMERCE Back in October I88I when the raising of scalps was a more popular pastime with the bulk of the inhabitants of the North western prairies than the raising of crops a handful of progressive citizens of Minneapolis got together and organized a Chamber of Commerce Association Certificates of membership to the number of fifty or thereabouts were issued and Col G D Rogers was elected secretary Matters dragged along for a few years with the infant organization little better than holding its own The original value of the membership certificates gradually increased and the personnel of the body continued high but there were few if any of the charter members who dreamed that the present powerful institution would be the outcome of the small beginning made in that early day for the city of Minneapolis It is true that the Falls of St Anthony were being developed for water power and a good share of that power was being used for grinding flour but crops were meager and very few citizens of the country had the hardihood to predict such rapid development of the North west as has been witnessed The railroads solved the problem however and with the rapid influx of settlers a market was needed for the products of the prairies Minneapolis was the natural market and the soil proved adapted to wheat Consequently from the small beginning of the association in October 188I the Minneapolis Chamber of Com merce has grown to be one of the most powerful institutions of its kind in the country and the Minneapolis wheat market has grown to be the greatest primary wheat market in the world The real holdings of the association now represent an invest 1A series of short articles reprinted in whole or in part from The National Hay and Grain Reporters issue of May 20 1911 These articles were specially prepared for The National Hay and Grain Reporters number on Grain Exchanges and are here reproduced by special permission 545The Annals of the American Academy ment of over a million dollars and its members own and control property worth many millions In the fall of I882 Col Rogers wrote an article for a leading Twin City newspaper predicting that the membership certificates then numbering 538 would be worth 3000 within twenty years The article brought down considerable ridicule on his head but the prediction came true nevertheless a high water mark of 5ooo being touched in about that time So the Colonel who is still actively connected with the affairs of the association as counsel lived to laugh last It was decided that 538 members were all that were wanted and needed and a limit was placed but in I900 a dozen more certificates were issued making a total of 550 where the limit has finally been fixed These member ships are worth in the neighborhood of 4ooo00 at the present writ ing Of the original fifty members about ten still hold certificates among them the Hon J C Haynes mayor of the city who drew up the articles of incorporation for the association System in handling the grain was the order of the day and it was developed as fast as the trade demanded Every effort was made to encourage agriculture and with the possible exception of one or two every year has seen an increase in the volume of grain coming into this market Still holding the palm of being the greatest primary wheat market of the country Minneapolis recently added the title of the greatest primary barley market of the country Primarily however Minneapolis is the great milling center made so by the unrivaled milling quality of Minnesota wheat The malt ing industry is in its infancy as far as this market is concerned but has made great strides in the past few years The milling industry has outgrown the Falls of St Anthony long since and steam auxiliary plants are turning most of the wheels The latest inno vation is the electric equipment recently installed by one of the largest and foremost milling companies The Minneapolis millers have always been in the lead as regards the correct and scientific way of making flour Extensive laboratories are maintained by all of the leading companies and when the flour comes off the rolls the volume and quality of the same is known to a nicety The high prices recorded in the local cash market in recent years have drawn considerable wheat from distant localities and tests are made of the different blends until the buyer on the exchange floor knows just how much of the softer 546 228Commercial Exchanges Minnesota and Iowa wheat is needed to mix with the hard Northern Minnesota and Dakota wheat A type sample is made and the seasons grind is based on it as conditions and the quality of the crop change from year to year Millers have had a leading voice in the policy of the association for years and it is due to their aggressiveness in the flour markets of the world to a great extent that the local exchange has grown so in importance They have nearly always paid the best price prevailing in the country for wheat The biggest millers of the country are members of the local Chamber of Commerce and they control the largest mills of the world It would not be fit nor proper to give the millers the whole credit for the expansion of the Chamber of Commerce however The elevator companies whose lines reach far out into the country and bring grain into this market have a great deal to do with it Big line elevator companies having their headquarters in Minneapolis handle the crop readily and bring a great deal of grain to this market that otherwise would find its way to competitive markets Even though the margin of profit has been cut down and the farmers cooperative movement has made it hard sledding in late years there are a number of powerful elevator organizations located here In fact it is nip and tuck between the elevator and milling crowd as to which branch of the trade is of greater impor tance in the affairs of the association but honors to date are about even There is little friction between them however and the har mony is seldom disturbed The terminal elevator capacity con trolled by members is well over the 40000000 bushel mark or second in the country in size A good share of this is represented by modern uptodate steel and concrete elevators second to none in the world The bulk of the business is under Chamber of Com merce rules and regulations and the banks accept the warehouse receipts without question when presented as collateral Along with the rest of the trade the elevator operators keep abreast with the times Through them to a great extent the seasons requirements are learned Their system of getting a line on the crop conditions is right up to date and when they have can vassed their agents for reports there is little use of waiting for other figures as a guide In fact the information gathered by them is in great demand by the trade in general and many base their 547 229The Annals of the American Academy position on the market on them almost exclusively so great is the territory the houses cover The commission department of the association is taken care of by an alert set of men mostly young in years but old in experience To get all the traffic will bear for their customers is the consuming ambition of most of them A good sale is a good sale and the ship per is given all that can be gotten out of the market Owing to the keen competition for the country trade it is probable that there is greater system here than in other lines When a car arrives it is disposed of as promptly as the market will permit and returns made to the consignor The great size of the freight cars nowadays and the high prices prevailing make a carload of grain quite an invest ment and the country dealer quite naturally wants to get his money back as quickly as possible and keep it working There are many cases on record where a car of wheat has been received sold and weighed on the same day the commission house clerk getting the weights the next morning billing for the car and making returns to the shipper the day following It is very ordinary for returns to be made within three or four days from the receipt of the grain In the busy season especially is the railroad more than willing to cooperate with the commission man and get the stuff unloaded as soon as possible and the car on its way back to the country again The study of the needs of the situation brings a lot of grain to this market that otherwise would be diverted to other mar kets as the shipper can get prompt returns which in many cases makes up for a slight difference in prices in favor of other markets The understanding between the commission men and country millers with mills within reasonable distance of Minneapolis where state weights can be obtained also tends to aid the former in getting business away from competitive markets Wheat arriving in the local market and sold to these millers will bring a half cent premium over the wheat sold for local delivery and weights The country millers make it a point to handle the grain promptly and send the certificate of weights to the commission house as quickly as possible The extra half cent more than makes up for the extra time taken for making returns to the shipper Relations between the commis sion men and millers are very cordial and few indeed are the differences that can not be settled amicably and with promptness and dispatch 548 230Commercial Exchanges Every facility is made use of by the buyer and seller in the cash department The big electric quotation clock is in plain sight at all times and the latest bid or offer price in the pit is recorded instantly by the official recorder This clock is the only one of its kind in the country or was up to within very recently It is the first one that could be successfully manipulated and has been the subject of much comment as well as the cause of many visits of investigation by representatives of other exchanges It was planned by a former chief engineer of the mechanical department of the association An accidental cutting off of the power at one time shortly after the installation made the cash wheat men doubly appreciative of the service it was performing This clock adds a finishing touch to what is perhaps the most modern and compact trading room of any exchange in the country The fluctuations recorded in an active market with its big red figures are rather demoralizing to a trader who is on the wrong side more so than a few insignificant chalk figures could be Under the clock board markers are busy chalking up the fluctuations in outside markets for the benefit of the members some of whom need to know the value of wheat in the winter wheat markets and some who need the coarse grain quotations Dealing in futures was not of any importance in the local mar ket until some time after the association was organized In fact the commitments made were no more or less than sales and pur chases to arrive within certain dates Now however there are a number of big commission houses who make a specialty of looking after trades in futures for their customers This branch of the business is as well attended to as any and the houses spare no effort to get the best they can for the people they represent Several of them have offices through the country and in active markets do a tremendous business In fact when the Northwest traders get real busy they often set the pace for the rest of the world at times when the spring wheat crop is threatened with drought or rust The reasonable size of the pit makes quick action possible and the oppor tunity offered for quick trading brings in a good deal of business and the fluctuations are an influence in the markets of the world Recently a hedging order was cabled direct from Antwerp for execution in the local pit Though there may be larger markets in the country in the way of trading in futures there are none that are 549 231The Annals of the American Academy ahead of the Minneapolis market in the handling of the trades and the official checking of the records A complete record of the trans action in the pit must be sent to the customer at the close of the session giving the name of the buyer or seller and the time the trade is made Every fluctuation is noted and the time at which it occurred These figures are published in the official publication of the Chamber of Commerce where the trader may easily verify and check any discrepancies Then all trades are reported to the clear ing house where they must check against each other Members failing to report trades are fined and in case of error or tardiness there are fines to be met which make the careful and prompt handling of the records a matter of economy It is proper to mention the Chamber of Commerce Clearing House Association at this point It is the pioneer organization of its kind in the country and for a number of years was the only one Most of the larger firms own memberships in it and it has been found to be almost a vital necessity to the trade Certainly it insures less friction than the old way of trading and also facilitates business generally When the trades are checked at the close of the session the member gives a check to the clearing house for margins or in case the market has fluctuated in the favor of their customers they receive a check It does away with a great deal of trouble To settle with the clearing house at a certain time every day is a far different matter than calling each other for margins Its plan of operation is practically the same as that of the clearing house of the banks and fills a need just as well Since it has been found successful here several other markets have adopted the plan and more are investigating it Its management is intrusted to its originator who is undoubtedly the closest mouthed individual in the community Of course the information he gets in his official capacity would be of great value to traders but a perfectly neutral attitude and a poker face are necessary to a man holding his position There have been no complaints as to his qualifications to date With the clearing house a part of the system there is no more satisfactory or reliable hedging market in the country Under the quotation clock in big red letters is official notice to the public that the quota tions are the property of the association only and bucketshops are forbidden the use of them There is never a relaxation of the vigi 550 232Commercial Exchanges lance over them where the bucketshops are concerned and as fast as leaks have been discovered they have been closed up promptly until the operators have given up in disgust One of the biggest bucketshops in the country met its Waterloo when it locked horns with the Minneapolis Chamber of Commerce Just say bucket shop above a whisper and there is a racket in a minute One of the chief objects of the Minneapolis Chamber of Com merce is to be of as great benefit to the producing and consuming ends of the grain business as possible It would be hard to find a more progressive and liberal minded set of business men in the country or one that is more interested in the development of the section it serves yet the grain raisers persistently misunderstand the motives and view the moves of the association with suspicion To become a member an applicant has to undergo a rigid investi gation of his previous career and must show his responsibility to look after the interest of possible customers without flunking The application is first handed to the membership committee and when they are through investigating the matter is put up to the board of directors where it is usually passed upon and the applicant admitted to membership if the report of the membership committee is favor able Occasionally however a snag is struck in one of the directors who may have some direct information of adverse nature or may not just like the report If such is the case further investi gation is made and the matter is gone over thoroughly before a certificate is transferred to the applicant By the foregoing proce dure the association keeps the morals of its body high The shippers are insured honorable and just treatment and once admitted into the association the member is entitled to the full confidence of the trade in general Every care is taken to show equal justice to all in the trade and shady or questionable transactions are sure to be followed by swift and sufficient discipline Flagrant offenses are very rare and no time is lost in purging the roll of the offending members name There are no memberships issued to corporations and each individual member is responsible for the actions of his firm or company Wheat remains the leading grain in this market but the coarse grain trade has grown wonderfully in the last decade If the reciprocity pact with Canada is passed there will be a great deal 55I 233The Annals of the Anmerican Academy more corn and oats sown in the Northwest and further strides are looked for in that direction The first year of the associations life about 25000000 bushels of wheat were handled and about 3000000 bushels of coarse grain Five years later about 40000000 bushels of wheat were handled and the coarse grain movement began to pick up decidedly until now the percentage of the move ment is a great deal less in favor of wheat In I886 about a half million bushels of corn were received in this market and I55000 bushels were shipped out Of the I909 crop 702I000 bushels were received and 504I000 bushels shipped Oats receipts increased from 1877000 bushels to 17610000 bushels in that time and barley receipts from I38000 bushels to 22555000 bushels Rye receipts in I886 were II00 bushels as compared with 2442000 bushels from the I909 crop and flax receipts were 349000 bushels compared with 925I000 bushels The last named cereal however was at high tide in I905 when 12231000 bushels were marketed The notable gain was made in the barley movement which has increased heavily every year for the last ten years Wheat receipts from the crop of I885 were 32767000 bushels and from the crop of I909 IOI567000 bushels Shipments from the I909 crop were 22093000 bushels compared with shipments of 4929000 bushels from the I885 crop From the 1885 crop 542858I barrels of flour were ground and shipped while I6919867 barrels of flour were ground and shipped from the I909 crop Last year 70000000 bushels of wheat were ground into flour by the local mills which have a capacity of IOOOOOOOO bushels and which the millers expect to put in full use when the Canadian pact is ratified The above statistics will tell the story of the growth of the Minneapolis Chamber of Commerce in plain fashion The develop ment of the Northwest in the cereal raising line has been phenom enal and unsurpassed and the growth has been due in some measure to the market Minneapolis offers for the products and the high comparative prices paid for the wheat crops The association is working hand in hand with the producer and middleman in the country and with a militant arm as represented in the Minneapolis Traffic Association in which it is a leading influence is protecting its territory from competing markets The old Chamber of Com merce building which readily housed members when it was built has been succeeded by a magnificent ten story building to which an 552 234Commnercial Exchanges annex has been added to take care of the overflow of the last few years Even at that a few big milling and elevator firms have quarters uptown because of the lack of space The opening up of new country constantly in the Northwest and the better methods of farming in use and being encouraged will assure future growth and present indications are that the association has many years of expansion before it and a constantly growing influence in the trade of the world THE DULUTH BOARD OF TRADE Duluth is at the head of deep water navigation on the Great Lakes the farthest point inland that can be reached by the great cairiers that have reduced transportation costs to the minimum This commanding position makes it the great distributing center of the Northwest and it is this that has made the Duluth Board of Trade one of the great primary markets of the United Statesthe third in point of total receipts in all years of normal production in the Northwest The first receipts of grain at Duluth came from the crop of I870 and followed immediately upon the entrance of the first rail road The great consuming markets of the East could be reached at cheapest cost by following the water route and from the moment it became possible to make use of this highway of transportation the movement of grain turned this way and began the building of a great grain market at Duluth As the facilities of transportation were improved and enlarged the business of the Duluth market rapidly increased and with the great agricultural expansion of the Northwest attained a growth that was practically without precedent in the country The eastern manufacturer of grain products looks to the Duluth market for his supplies of Northwestern grain It is here that the eastern flour miller gets his supply of spring wheat the maltster his northwestern barley the food manufacturers and feed dealers their oats and the linseed mills their flax The same advan tages that have led to the building up of a great eastern shipping market have brought the development of a large export trade its volume depending upon the market conditions existing in this and other countries When a few years ago the Northwest went extensively into 553 235The Annals of the American Academy the raising of flax Duluth immediately became the leading flax market of the country which position it still holds Since the beginning of the production of durum wheat it has held the same position with respect to that variety of grain and is now the only market in which contracts for future delivery in those two com modities are dealt in In spring wheat the demands of the mills of the Northwest must naturally be first supplied but in obtaining those supplies the northwestern miller must meet the competition of the eastern miller who is bidding at Duluth for the fine wheat of the northwestern prairies The existence of the market at Duluth is therefore a direct and convincing benefit to the producer of the Northwest The Duluth market is by no means at its zenith at the present time Its prospects for the future are as bright as its record of the past Tremendous as are the strides made by the Northwest in agricultural development its possibilities have been far from reached Almost onehalf of North Dakota is untouched and the same is true of South Dakota Northern Minnesota is a great fertile region which has been suffering from an impression that it offered little hope but there are already signs that a great tide of immigration is coming this way Montana is fast being broken into agriculture and is a veritable empire that will soon be one of the great grain raising states of the Union Should Congress adopt the reciprocity agreement the result cannot but be to add to the importance of the Duluth market The Canadian surplus goes East via the lakes With free trade in grain the port of Duluth will be a competitor for the traffic and the Canadian farmer will have two markets wherein to sell his products where he now has but one The Duluth Board of Trade as an organization has prospered It owns a handsome sevenstory building Ioo by 140 feet practically free from debt It has two hundred memberships out standing all in active use Ample elevator capacity is an essential for every primary market and Duluth is well equipped in this respect the capacity operated by Duluth companies aggregating 32275000 bushels Of this amount 24500000 bushels is regular with its warehouse receipts deliverable on contracts 554 236Commercial Exchanges THE BOARD OF TRADE OF KANSAS CITY MO The Board of Trade of Kansas City was organized in I869 The grain and milling business of Kansas City is and has been for many years one of its most important industries Situated as it is in the center of the very best farming territory of the country with railroad facilities unsurpassed it naturally is a great grain receiving and distributing market drawing from Oklahoma Kansas Southern Nebraska Western Iowa and Western Missouri It is the second largest primary wheat market and ranks third as a flour milling center in the United States The mills when running at full time require 65ooo bushels of wheat each twentyfour hours The following statement of the receipts of grain shows the development of the business in this market 1870 I037000 bushels I880 9029930 bushels I890 29939200 bushels I900 46638250 bushels 1905 69599500 bushels I9IO 50221300 bushels These figures however are not a complete statement of the business done by the members of the Kansas City Board of Trade from the fact that whenever the prices in this country are on a shipping basis with the foreign markets large quantities of grain are bought by our members and exported direct without passing through Kansas City and therefore do not enter into the statistical report of this board The handling of grain at terminal markets requires large storage capacity and these facilities must necessarily keep pace with the growth of the business In this respect Kansas City has met the requirements of the trade for the elevator capacity which in I880 was 1560000 bushels has steadily grown and is now over II0000OO bushels The first flour mill in Kansas City was built fortyfive years ago In the early days of milling here only soft winter wheat was ground Hard wheat was not known as a winter crop This variety of wheat was introduced by the Russian Mennonites who settled in the central part of Kansas These people brought with them to America seed wheat of their own raising in the Crimea At first it found no favor but afterwards it was discovered that it closely resembled the spring wheat of Minnesota which wheat has made Minneapolis flour famous At first the mills ground the hard winter wheat in an experimental way but the quality of the flour and bread produced from it quickly caused an increased 555 237The Annals of the American Academy demand so at the present time all but the Kansas City mills grind the hard turkey wheat Kansas now produces an average of 80oooooo bushels of wheat This with the large yield of Oklahoma and Nebraska insures the Kansas City mills a constant and unfailing supply Our millers find a market in the states east of the Missouri Cuba and Porto Rico and have some trade with South American ports Kan sas City flour is shipped in great quantities to Great Britain Bel gium Holland Denmark Scandanavia and to some extent to Mediterranean ports There is large and active trading in futures on the floor of the Kansas City Board of Trade All trades in wheat are based on No 2 hard wheat which is known to the trade as contract wheat and the wheat deliverable in contracts must be acceptable to a Board of Trade Committee which Committee is composed of experts appointed by the president and confirmed by the directors This gives an opportunity for millers to buy for future delivery which they may use as a hedge or accept delivery as they may deem expedient This is the only market in which future trading in wheat is based exclusively on hard winter wheat The State of Kansas in the year I909 raised I54255000 bushels of corn While the handling of corn and other cereals in this market is of great importance yet it is small compared with the large quantity raised in the territory tributary to Kansas City This can be accounted for from the fact that comparatively a small percentage of the corn raised is shipped out of the state there being an enormous and increasing demand for this cereal for cattle feeding the farmers finding it profitable to market their corn in the form of fattened beef and pork The board of trade for many years has had a thoroughly well established supervising weight department which insures abso lutely correct weights It also has a sampling department which is constantly growing in favor and usefulness Increasing purchases and sales are made based upon the sample submitted which sample is deposited with the chief sampler and deliveries are made under the chief samplers supervision His acceptance or rejection is final The average yield of wheat per acre in most sections of the United States is much less than in European countries and of late 556 238Commnercial Exchanges more general and active interest is being taken by agricultural col leges and economists looking to the improvement of seed and more intensive farming This we believe will result in producing a better and larger yield of cereals In this the Kansas City Board of Trade is deeply interested giving it its moral and financial sup port We trust that careless and indifferent farming will in the near future be a matter of history as pertaining to a people of a new country in possession of large undeveloped resources THE KANSAS CITY BOARD OF TRADE CLEARING HOUSE Kansas Citys rise to third place among the grain future mar kets of the United States dates from the organization of the Board of Trade Clearing Company in March I899 Previous to that time the operations in deferred contracts were few and irregular and the market had no rank as a speculative centre As an illustra tion of the insignificance of the trade during the middle nineties it may be recalled that one of the elder members of the board of trade pointing toward the empty hexagonal pit remarked That useless thing should be torn out and made into kindling wood But new blood was coming into the exchange and the pos sibility of developing something more than a mere cash grain market was recognized Somebody made a suggestion and the result was the establishment of an association with the avowed pur pose of facilitating the trade in futures Kansas City being the leading winter wheat market of the country as well as a big receiv ing and distributing point for corn and oats the wonder is that traders here and throughout the Southwest had so long been con tent to send their hedging and speculative orders to Chicago The company was incorporated and capitalized at 5000 mak ing the shares 50 each Within a year or two the success of the enterprise was assured and in I902 the stock issue was doubled the Ioo additional shares being sold at I75 each the book value at that time Membership in the company was limited to Board of Trade members the number of shares to be held by one person being restricted to 20 The actual number of members today is IIo and the book value of shares is 350 Annual dividends of 20 a share have been regularly paid although the clearing charge has been reduced from 3c per Iooo bushels to 2c 557 239The Annals of the American Academy Primarily the clearing house system was modeled after that of the Minneapolis Chamber of Commerce but with the increase of business came the necessity for greater economy of time and a simplification of methods The office work was systematized and perfected by W L Garrett who was manager from May 900o to January I 1903 It was in 190o that George G Lee entered the service of the company as assistant manager Under Mr Gar rett Mr Lee caught the spirit of the unique cancellation system and after further service under A D Wright in I903 and I904 Mr Lee was chosen as manager with G M Edgecomb as assist ant The office has since remained under the control of the two men last named and their work is highly satisfactory According to the statement of Mr Lee the total operating expense of the clearing house is only 5000 a year exclusive of telegraph charges for sending market reports to other cities All work is done in a single room on the fifth floor of the Board of Trade building between 8 a m and 4 p m The rush comes with the close of the market at I i5 in the afternoon as all reports must be in by 215 On Saturday when the market closes at noon the balancing of accounts is done by 30 p m Promptness in making returns to the clearing house is enforced by a fine of I when a member is 15 minutes late and every 5 minutes of additional tardi ness costs I The fine for errors is 25 cents The manager has a wide latitude in calling for margins said Mr Lee This is necessary in cases of wild market fluctuations or where members are suspected of financial embarrassment As the clearing house is responsible for all trades put through it close tab must be kept on the position of each member One of the advantages of the system we use is the dispensing with the identity of the trades cleared through the house All we know is that Tom bought and sold so many thousand bushels of grain in a day dealing with Dick or Harry and that the returns of these other traders exactly correspond with Toms records We dont know or care whether the trades were individual or for customers That detail is a matter for the members bookkeepers Under the system the tying up of large sums of money in margins in event that a long or short on the other end refuses to ring out is avoided Thus an evil which tends to concentrate future trading into the hands of the stronger firms is eliminated The theory is 558 240Commercial Exchanges that the small firm has the same right as the big one to handle future business so long as the margins tendered to the clearing house are sufficient to protect the trades involved So well is the Board of Trade Clearing Companys system regarded that it has recently been copied by a similar organization in the St Louis Merchants Exchange Nashville traders borrowed the idea a few months ago and the system is in use in Omaha Wichita and New OrleansBY T J TANNER OMAHA GRAIN EXCHANGE The nearer the point of production a market is situated the greater the efficiency of that market both to the producer and the consumer This maxim has unquestionably been proven by Omaha the youngest grain market of importance in the United States which has risen in six years from a mere distributing point to a position among the first grain markets of the country From the time of the formation of the Omaha Grain Exchange to the present the market has steadily grown in efficiency and the skeptic who at first looked with apprehension on the exchange has grown to respect and support itthe country shipper and outside purchaser alike attesting to its stability Omaha is purely a primary market and the only purely primary market of prominence in the country Not a bushel of grain is received during the year except that which is shipped from the country stations Fully fifty per cent of this is in turn reshipped to points other than established markets This fact alone proves its efficiency as between the producer and consumer The country shipper of Nebraska South Dakota and Western Iowa consigning his grain to Omaha is not only assured of prompt railroad service because of the proximity of the market and thereby lessening his chances of deterioration as in the case of corn but this short haul greatly reduces his interest charges which are a big item during the course of a years business The weighing and inspec tion departments which are independent and under the control of the exchange are of the highest standard and no better safeguards are offered in any market The fees of this department are less than at any other large market The reinspection rules are strictly adhered to and the matter of discounts is left to a committee of 559 241The Annals of the American Academy unbiased members of the exchange who determine what discounts if any shall be allowed according to the values of the grain and not according to any set averages of grades Trading among the members is broad and liberal and a more square more aggressive association of business men cannot be found anywhere Prices are uniformly on a parity with the other markets and the price of oats has been higher in Omaha the past two years than at any other point For years it has easily maintained the proud position of Second Primary Corn Market Omaha has started the year 1911 as the fourth primary market of the United States Previous to the organization of the exchange the elevator capacity was 2140000 bushels and the receipts for I904 which was the first year of the existence of the exchange were less than 18 oooooo bushels of which approximately 4000oo0 bushels were wheat 900000ooo bushels corn and 4050000 bushels oats Com pared with this the market received 24000000 bushels of corn alone last year being the second primary corn market of the country Receipts for the last two or three years have been about 43000000 or 44000000 bushels or two and onehalf times as great as for the first year of the life of the market The elevator capacity has almost trebled being now 6II5000 bushels Though total grain receipts for last year varied but slightly from the previous year Omaha gained over 3000000 bushels in corn receipts growing to greater importance than ever before as a primary corn market It is not strange though that corn receipts are large or that it is expected that they will be still larger in coming years as Omaha is a natural market for two great corn states Ne braska and Iowa When the exchange was started it was with a limited number of smaller dealers the line companies had practically all the busi ness Now thirtyeight active grain firms hold membership in the exchange with ninetytwo active grain members And at the same time the line companies are doing more business than ever before The market has broadened A large percentage of the membership does a consignment business and the market is broad enough now so that any commission merchant can always find an outlet for his patrons grain at attractive figures More actual transactions have been made on the exchange floor within the last year than in any other year in the exchanges history The records of Chief Grain 560 242Commercial Exchanges Inspector Powell show that more grain by 25 per cent was weighed and inspected in Omaha in I9IO than in any other previous year F P MANCHESTER Secretary THE BUFFALO CORN EXCHANGE The grain trade of Buffalo prior to I9o6 was associated with the Chamber of Commerce which was the general commercial organization of the city representing as it did all branches of local industry For a long period previous to this the Buffalo grain merchants enthused with a growing pride in their city and realizing the magnitude of the grain business which it enjoyed determined that Buffalo like all other large grain centers should support an exclusive grain organization Consequent upon this universal desire to boost the commercial interests of the great city of Buffalo and to unite all the representative grain interests of this port under an exclusive association the Corn Exchange of Buffalo was organized and commenced active operations in April 19o6 At this time the departments of inspection and weighing of grain were assumed by the corn exchange and entire jurisdiction over all matters pertain ing to the grain trade were taken by the newly organized body At the outset the corn exchange enjoyed the confidence and respect of her sister grain exchanges and was abundantly supported by the grain trade at large The Buffalo grain interests teeming with pride in the success of their efforts have perfected an organi zation representing an exclusive cash grain market unsurpassed in the United States The success of the grain business in this city is evidenced by an increase in the annual working force in the inspection and weighing department of from seven employees in I898 to thirtytwo in I9II Buffalo is especially favored as a grain center it being an undisputed fact that it is the greatest as well as the most available distributing point in the United States due to the exceptional geographical position which it enjoys and the transportation facili ties it possesses both rail and water The city located as it is at the foot of the Great Lakes is a magnet between the grain shipping interests of the West and the Northwest and the Atlantic seaboard being accessible by numerous trunk line railroads of which Buffalo is the terminus Upwards of fifteen railroads enter the city render ing the most complete facilities for handling the grain product of 56i 243The Annals of the American Academy the West and distributing same throughout the East and South The elevator facilities are unexcelled with a capacity of upwards of 22000000 bushels and at an approximate cost of I4ooo000ooo This elevator capacity for receiving grain from lake vessels and railroads and transferring same to canal boats and cars makes a possible transfer capacity each twentyfour hours of 5500000 bushels Also the malting interests of this city represent a total storage capacity of II550000 bushels with an estimated capital of 6oooooo The large transfer elevator capacity and facilities for handling grain afford a great protection to shippers especially of corn which at certain seasons of the year is susceptible to rapid changes in condition Such grain is cooled dried and put into merchantable condition for a reasonable charge thus placing the Buffalo market in an enviable position for the disposal of soft corn and any other grain which is out of condition This is partially evidenced by a comparison of the receipts of corn in I9Io of about 37793368 bushels as against 31478578 bushels in I9o9 Buffalo is also listed among the first cities of the United States for its flour milling industry which showed an output in I9IO of 4095650 barrels an increase of 695000 barrels over I909 During the year I909 and I9IO the milling industry has been greatly im proved and the output increased 8ooo barrels daily with a total daily output of 20000 barrels making it the second milling city in the world Taking a resume of Buffalos superior advantages as a grain market it occupies a position unexcelled in this country which is evidenced by its excellent geographical position its elevator equip ment its lake and rail facilities for receiving handling and dis tributing grain and grain products and the protection afforded the grain trade through the organization of the corn exchange which it is the duty and privilege of this and all other grain exchanges to provideFRED B POND Secretary THE COMMERCIAL EXCHANGE OF PHILADELPHIA After a successful history of fiftyseven years keeping in close touch with the domestic and export grain trade of the United States and the exact situation in other countries and always in the 562 244Commercial Exchanges lead for the greatest advantages of its terminal port the improve ment of the water rail facilities and the most equitable rates and regulations for traffic the highest standard inspections of all manner of grains as well as flour feeds hay and straw together with provisions the members of the commercial exchange can look back through the dim vista of the past with the greatest pride on the many substantial accomplishments brought about for the advantage of the growing business interests of Philadelphia and the Keystone State with its busy neighbors almost entirely through the efforts of this prominent and influential trade organization Like many leading commercial associations of the present day its beginning was of the humblest character but great oaks from little acorns grow For in the year 1854 a modest coterie of flour and grain men assembled in a small room on the second floor at Second and Gold streets and after some interchange of opinions they decided to form a business association and a tenta tive constitution and bylaws were adopted At the next meeting a ponderous leatherbound book was presented still in the posses sion of the exchange in which the first minutes were recorded and the signatures of the men who were the leaders in this movement are therein contained as legible as on the day when they were written and it may be of some interest to note that the penmanship of those times was exceedingly ornate inasmuch as the signatures of the most conservative of the merchants are replete with really graceful flourishes William B Thomas the fatherinlaw of Hunter Brooke the present head of the wellknown malt and grain firm first a colonel then a general in the Federal Army and afterwards Collector of the Port of Philadelphia presided at these early meetings and was chosen chairman of the committee to draft the constitution and was installed the first president of the then known Corn Exchange Association Samuel L Witmer was made secretary For a time the preliminary organization became known as The Flour and Grain Exchange Association for it was then simply a combination for the furthering of the retail trade and many of the great tracts of land which since have made wheat history for the world were then only known as virgin soil The telegraph had just rounded its first decade and the intercontinental cable had not been laid In those days the grain trade in general had 563 245The Annals of the American Academy the romance of uncertainty and modern speculating in grain is like betting on a sure thing as compared to the reckless way in which Dame Fortune was wooed when the exchange was in its infancy For example a ship would leave this port and put out to sea laden with grain The consignor did not know what he would get for the cargo The trip might be an entire loss or perhaps a snug little fortune was realized Often times there would be a rumor in this country that there was a famine in Ireland and as it took a sailing vessel at least two months to make the voyage across the ocean the distress could be relieved before the ship reached Liverpool The skippers of the grain ships were mainly of that sturdy resourceful type who would frequently be entrusted with selling the grain when the coast of England was reached If the captain of the craft was not accorded this responsibility a young man from the brokers office or a member of the firm listed as a supercargo would make the voyage As sixty days was the average time to sail across the ocean it was usually an additional month before the consignor could learn what had been the fate of the cargo During those long long waits the merchant of Philadelphia controlled his nerves as best he could haunting the ship offices to glean the thirtydayold gossip But if the news at last proved favorable the profits were often large and the financial harvest added an encouraging zest of adven ture to the next cargo which was sent out from the port But things are different now for that was over half a century ago Now the grain and flour feed and hay are bought in the West and elsewhere by wire and if the grain goes to England it is sold by cablegram and the transportation is frequently arranged by telephone The shipper knows just how the market stands at every point in the civilized world and through the uptodate business progression the oldtime romance of wheat and corn exporting has been completely wiped out of existence The initial meetings of the exchange were held at Second and Gold streets but as the association became strong in membership and influence a building of its own was erected on the east side of Second street between Walnut and Chestnut which was styled the Chamber of Commerce and was pointed out as the headquarters 564 246Commercial Exchanges of the grain trade to business strangers coming to the city The exchange occupied the second floor with offices below the structure being on the historic ground of the old Slate Roof house of William Penn and when the Corn Exchange proposed to build and William Welsh at the head of a committee of citizens secured the property the Quaker element was shocked as they maintained that a priceless relic was sacrificed When it was proposed to purchase as far south as Walnut street the discovery was made that a small portion of land twelve by sixteen feet was not covered by original deeds or patents This proved to belong to the Six Nations to which it had been presented by the sons of William Penn when the Indian Chiefs on a visit to Philadelphia refused to negotiate a treaty or even talk about it until they could stand on their own ground and build a council fire on their own land One of the committee visited the Indian Reservation on the Allegheny River and was referred to Colonel Parker their chief in New York He confirmed the fact but said there was no record a wampum belt having been the confirmation This belt has since been deposited at Albany with all the wampum belts of the Six Nations and said to have been destroyed by the recent fire at the Capitol buildings Granville Penn visited this plot of ground and knew all about it The exact location is in the rear of 45 South Second street The dedication of this new home took place on March I I869 just a year following the change of the name of the organ ization from the Corn Exchange Association to the Commercial Ex change of Philadelphia and after an occupancy of nine months a disastrous fire broke out and the building was burned to the ground the entire fire department of the city failing in their endeavor to save the structure which was of brick The next great chapter in the history of the exchange was the movement which brought about the establishment of the American Line of steamships making quick communications between this port and Great Britain then came the stubborn but successful contest with New York to retain the ruling differentials here which was a longdrawn period of trade warfare Before the war Philadelphia had an extensive trade with the southern states and after peace was declared the main source of supply was in Pennsylvania Ohio Southern Delaware and Maryland This condition however was changed by the outreaching of the western trunk lines when the 565 247The Annals of the American Academy great wheat and corn belts west and northwest of the Missouri River were thrown open Thirty or forty years ago 20000 pounds was considered a maximum freight car load and all above that was charged as excess freight now the maximum is easily Iooooo pounds In 1854 the grain firm that had a correspondent one hundred and fifty miles away within the country was considered unusually progressive while now the members deal two thousand miles inland and three thousand miles over the water With the development of the industry came a change in the class of memberships which in the beginning covered miscellaneous business Coal dealers liquor men grocers and dry goods merchants have dropped out and those princi pally interested in cereals are mainly in evidence now The member ship is comprised largely of those handling flour feeds grain hay straw and provisions though leading representatives of the banks railroads shipping lines distillers and brewers are still on the roll In I8945 when the Bourse was completed with its mammoth building which extends from Fourth to Fifth streets the length of an entire square and modeled after its foreign namesake the only establishment of its kind in the United States the Commercial Exchange disposed of its stock holdings in the Chamber of Com merce building and under President E L Rogers made a lease for their present quarters on the north side of the main floor of the Bourse which they now occupy and while for a time some of the veterans in the grain trade looked upon the move of abandoning their old home for a modern leasehold as an unfortunate move and loss of identity the great advantages derived in the accommodations and facilities including telegraphs tickers quotation boards long and short distance telephones office floor and sample table space postoffice reading writing and news rooms with dining restaurant and every known uptodate equipment and privilege they have become fully reconciled to its untold improvements and comforts The grain inspection department for twentyfive years in special personal charge of Captain John 0 Foering who received all inspection dues and paid his corps of assistants bringing the character of inspections at this port up to the highest standard has now become a fixed department and asset of the exchange whose chief official is William J Duffy who occupies a special room in the Bourse building with his deputies 566 248Commercial Exchanges While the exchange is one of the oldest trade bodies in the country from time to time at the closing of each year it has thrown its dignity to the winds and lined up the grain men against the flour men in a pitched battle over the grain floor after call hours pelting each other most mercilessly with sample bags of grain and flour until one side gained the victory But reform and progressive ness became popular a year ago and this ancient but strenuous custom has been consigned to the tombs of the Capulets and music and song and good fellowship now usher out the old year In the early days the annual elections were most expensive and exciting champagne flowed like water and green wads changed a plenty and cabs and carriages gave free rides to voters from every section of the city Now with an occasional exception this annual affair which closes with a luncheon is a veritable love feast Exports of corn in I900 footed up 33452170 bushels and in I908 there was shipped abroad I7061938 bushels of wheat and in I899 the export oats total footed up 7880766 bushels but since Russia and the Argentines have gone into sharp competition for the European balance grain trade exports here as well as elsewhere have fallen off considerably THE MILWAUKEE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE The Milwaukee Chamber of Commerce is one of the oldest exchanges of the West or middle West and Milwaukee at one time as we are fond of recalling was probably the principal primary market of the country That proud distinction cannot be claimed for her now under the changed conditions of transportation the shifting of population centers and the development of new territory but Milwaukee nevertheless lays rightful claim to many advan tages as a market for grain that will ever keep her in the front rank and there will be in the future an organized and systematic influence at work to keep these advantages and the superior facilities existing in this market before the eyes of the rest of the world Considering Milwaukee as a market to which the shipper may profitably consign his grain hay and seeds we are proud of our weighing and inspection departments and are gratified to know that Milwaukee weights have an enviable reputation for reliability among the trade as has so often been testified to Milwaukee is one of the very few large markets of the country 567 249The Annals of the American Academy where the inspection of grain is not under the control of the state The inspection here is under the supervision of the Milwaukee Chamber of Commerce and in the fifty odd years that this has been so no occasion has arisen for placing the inspection of grain in any other hands than those of the chamber of commerce The department is constantly striving to improve methods and increase efficiency until there has been evolved an almost perfect piece of mechanism which serves the association of six hundred members composed of all the varied interests receiving shipping milling malting etc with equal justice and fairness to all The improved methods adopted for the sampling and inspection of grain have been the means during the past year of attracting buyers to this market where the grades of grain can be fully relied upon comparing favorably in this respect with any other market MIilwaukee as a Market Milwaukee furnishes an excellent market for wheat and all the coarse grains Mills and malting establishments require wheat and barley for manufacturing purposes and during I9Io approximately 6oooooo bushels of wheat and IIoooooo bushels of barley went into local consumption for the manufacture of flour and malt respectively The total receipts of all kinds of grain at Milwaukee during I9O1 were 48355914 bushels with two exceptions viz 1898 and I899 the largest in any year in the history of the city Corn and oats are handled extensively here and a large trade exists with Eastern territory in these grains An exceptionally good outlet to the East is found in the transit lines across Lake Michigan to Grand Haven and Ludington Carferry and break bulk service in connection with the Pere Marquette and Grand Trunk Railways is maintained throughout the entire year The eastern buyer is enabled to receive an official certificate which shows him that the weight of grain being transferred through the elevator of the railroad company on the east shore of Lake Michi gan has been determined under the supervision of a sworn weigher of the Milwaukee Chamber of Commerce There is no market more favorably situated than Milwaukee so far as the cost of freight transportation is concerned and ship pers are given the benefit of the lowest freight rates in having their 568 250Commercial Exchanges grain ultimately placed with the dealer manufacturer or consumer either in the western or eastern market The railway companies during the past year have greatly increased the terminal facilities at Milwaukee and grain shipments are given preference over nearly all other kinds of freight Switch ing arrangements both locally and to connecting lines are now perfect and at the least expense to the shippers Much has been recently said and written regarding privilege trading a form of contract which is used in most all markets but with certain restrictions or modifications in some Trading in privileges is one of the features in this market It has never been regarded as illegal in Wisconsin as it has been declared in some other states In fact a Wisconsin law of the I90203 session asserts That in every purchase or sale or purchase and sale and all other transactions by or between members of any lawfully con stituted chamber of commerce or board of trade organized under or by virtue of the laws of this state and in accordance with the charter of such corporation and the rules bylaws and resolutions adopted therein shall be prima facie validH A PLUMB Secretary THE TOLEDO PRODUCE EXCHANGE With its splendid location and almost unrivaled transportation facilities Toledo stands well to the front among the terminal grain markets of the country The city can look backward to a glorious past in the annals of grain history but what is more important the market is flourishing lustily at present and gives promise of con tinued growth and development Reasons why the city at the mouth of the Maumee always has been a big grain center are not hard to find Twentyone steam railways draining one of the most fertile agricultural sections on the face of the globe make it the fourth railroad center in the country Another powerful factor is the magnificent harbor on whose ample bosom could snugly nestle all the craft on the great lakes without any crowding There are practically fifteen miles of water deep enough for vessels of maxi mum draught In a number of important particulars Toledo is really a worlds power It is the center for the milling of soft winter wheat flour 569 251The Annals of the American Academy and leads in this type of grain As the leading clover seed market Toledo gets recognition abroad as well as at home In the matter of elevators Toledo is splendidly fortified While the gross capacity is somewhat less than in former days when wooden houses predominated the fact that practically all are of modern fireproof construction shows the storage proposition in a better light The general impression is that the day of the danger ous frame structure has neared the end It is a matter of interest that in Toledo the first iron tank for grain was built This was in I894 Recently concrete has been used with such success that more elevators will be built of this material To Toledo belongs the credit of successfully experimenting with the movable marine leg for handling cereals and flaxseed Toledo is destined to broaden out from practically a strictly winter wheat milling center to a distributing point for spring wheat Flour men realizing the advantage of Toledo as a strategic point are pulling together as never before in an effort to get the market all it deserves in the way of freight rates and other things Most local mills are realizing the importance of spring and winter wheat blend flours and the demand for local use and shipment to interior points continues to enlarge Besides giving Toledo first rank in the world as a market the trade in field seeds helps the grain business materially There is a reason why the city plays the leading role in clover seed Toledo is located in the center of the richest clover territory in the country the productiveness it is believed being the result of moisture carried by winds from the great lakes The local seed market is notable for its exclusive system of trading in futures In no other market are there transactions in clover futures 570 252

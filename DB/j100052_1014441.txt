J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1014441,FOREWORD,I242665,FOREWORD THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PRINCIPLES AND METHODS OF SOCIAL CASE WORK HAS BEEN A SLOW AND ALMOST UNCONSCIOUS EVOLUTION ONLY RE CENTLY HAVE SOCIAL CASE WORKERS BECOME ARTICULATE IN THE TECHNIQUE OF THEIR FIELD THEY HAVE BEEN SUCH  DEADLY DOERS THAT LITTLE TIME HAS BEEN LEFT TO ANALYZE CRITICALLY THE TECHNIQUE OF THE DAYS WORK MISS RICHMONDS BOOK SOCIAL DIAGNOSIS IS MONUMENTAL NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF ITS SCOPE AND SCHOLARSHIP BUT BECAUSE IT MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THAT PAINSTAKING ANALYSIS OF THE METHODS AND PRINCIPLES OF SOCIAL CASE WORK WHICH MUST OBTAIN GENERALLY BEFORE SOCIAL CASE WORKERS CAN CALL THEIR CHOSEN FIELD A PROFESSION MISS RICHMONDS BOOK DEALS EXCLUSIVELY WITH SOCIAL DIAGNOSIS TREATMENT BEING OMITTED EXCEPT IN THE SENSE THAT ALL DIAGNOSIS IS A PART OF TREATMENT A VOLUME ON SOCIAL CASE TREATMENT IS THEREFORE OPPORTUNE ESPE CIALLY IN VIEW OF THE URGENT NEED AT THIS TIME OF AN AUTHORITATIVE STATEMENT OF THE BEST THOUGHT AND PRACTICE IN THE FIELD OF TREATMENT BECAUSE OF THE MANY SOCIAL PROBLEMS INCIDENT TO THE WAR WHILE THE WAR MAY HAVE CREATED NO NEW TYPE OF SOCIAL PROBLEMS IT HAS INCREASED THEM MANY FOLD AND HAS GIVEN SOME ENTIRELY NEW SETTINGS THE INEVITABLE DISLOCATION OF INDUSTRIAL LIFE WITH ITS MIGRATIONS OF WORKERS THE DISRUPTION OF FAMILY LIFE IN MANY HOMES FOLLOWING THE DEPARTURE OF THE FATHER OR SON FOR WAR SERVICE THE READJUSTMENT TO INDUSTRIAL LIFE OF THE SOLDIER RETURNING FROM THE FRONT POSSIBLY CRIPPLED OR HANDICAPPED BY BLINDNESS ALL MAKE A KNOWLEDGE OF THE PRINCIPLES AND METHODS OF SOCIAL CASE TREATMENT OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE IT IS HOPED THAT THE PRESENT VOLUME IN ADDITION TO BEING OF INTEREST TO THE GENERAL READER WILL PROVE NOT ONLY A REFERENCE BOOK TO WHICH SOCIAL CASE WORKERS GENERALLY MAY TURN FOR NEW LIGHT ON SOME OF THEIR OLDEST PROBLEMS BUT THAT IT WILL ALSO SERVE AS A STORE HOUSE OF KNOWLEDGE BASED ON TESTED EXPERIENCE FOR ALL HOME SERVICE WORKERS AND ALL THOSE OTHER WORKERS PROFESSIONAL AND VOLUNTEER WHO HAVE BEEN DRAFTED IN THE RANKS OF SOCIAL CASE WORKERS BECAUSE OF THE UNPRECEDENTED DEMAND FOR THIS TYPE OF WORK INCIDENT TO THE WAR IT SHOULD NEVER BE LOST SIGHT OF IN THIS CONNECTION THAT THE PROBLEMS OF CIVILIAN RELIEF DIFFER IN NO ESSENTIALS FROM THE PROBLEMS WHICH SOCIAL CASE WORKERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY HAVE BEEN MEETING IN THEIR VIIFOREWORD DAYS WORK BEFORE THE WAR AND THAT THE METHODS OF HELPING TO SOLVE THEM DIFFER IN NO ESSENTIAL DETAILS FROM THE METHODS FOLLOWED IN THE PAST BY THE BEST OF OUR CASEWORKING AGENCIES HUMAN NATURE DOES NOT CHANGE OVER NIGHT NOR DURING A WAR THE BIG PROBLEMS OF A WIDOWS FAMILY ARE THE SAME WHETHER THE HUSBAND HAS LOST HIS LIFE IN THE MILITARY OR INDUSTRIAL ARMY THEREADJUSTMENT OF A MAN TO INDUSTRIAL LIFE IS MUCH THE SAME BE HE CRIPPLED BY A BURSTING SHELL OR BY A BURSTING FLY WHEEL IN THE FACTORY QUESTIONS OF CARE FOR ORPHANED CHILDREN ARE MUCH THE SAME BE THE CAUSE OF THEIR ORPHAN HOOD SICKNESS AND ANXIETY INCIDENT TO WAR OR DEATH FOLLOWING OCCU PATIONAL DISEASE WHILE CERTAIN ARTICLES LIKE THAT BY MISS HAMBURGER ON THE CRIPPLE AND HIS PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY THAT BY MISS WRIGHT ON OFFSETTING THE HANDICAP OF BLINDNESS AND THAT BY THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF CIVILIAN RELIEF ON SOLDIERS AND SAILORS FAMILIES MAY SEEM TO HAVE MORE DIRECT BEARING ON THE PROBLEMS OF THE HOME SERV ICE WORKER IT IS FELT THAT ALL THE ARTICLES THROW LIGHT ON PROBLEMS WITH WHICH HOME SERVICE WORKERS WILL SOONER OR LATER HAVE TO DEAL IN FACT THE PRINCIPLES AND METHODS OF SOCIAL CASE WORK ARE UNIVERSAL IN THEIR APPLICATION NOT ONLY IS THE CORNERSTONE OF ALL CASE WORK INDIVIDUALIZATION OF TREATMENTREVOLUTIONIZING THE SCIENCE OF PENOLOGY BUT IT IS PROFOUNDLY MODIFYING OUR EDUCATIONAL PRACTICE SMALL CLASSES MORE FREQUENT PROMOTIONS SPECIAL CLASSES FOR THE BACKWARD AND FOR THE HANDICAPPED AS WELL AS THE MOVEMENT FOR INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION ALL REFLECT THE GROWING RECOGNITION AMONG EDU CATORS OF THE PRINCIPLE OF INDIVIDUALIZATION EVEN IN OUR HOME LIFE WE MUST USE THIS PRINCIPLE IF WE ARE TO UNDERSTAND THE DEVELOPING LIFE OF OUR OWN CHILDREN COME WHAT MAY IN THE FUTURE EVOLUTION OF OUR SOCIAL LIFE THIS PRINCIPLE WILL STAND AS VITAL AND THE TIME AND THOUGHT AND PATIENCE THAT ARE PUT INTO THIS DELICATE WORK WILL RE CEIVE MORE AND MORE RECOGNITION AS THE PARENT THE TEACHER AND THE SOCIAL WORKER CAN SHOW THE RESULTS THAT COME FROM ITS APPLICATION A VOLUME ON SOCIAL CASE TREATMENT COVERS BUT A SECTION THOUGH AN IMPORTANT ONE OF THE WHOLE FIELD OF SOCIAL WORK THE UNITY OF SOCIAL WORK IS SUCH THAT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ANY PROGRAM OF SOCIAL WORKERS IS MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY THE QUALITY OF WORK DONE IN ANY PART OF THE FIELD ALL GOOD SOCIAL CASE WORK HAS A DOUBLE VALUE IT NOT ONLY MAKES POSSIBLE WORK WITH A GIVEN INDIVIDUAL OR FAMILY HELP ING THEM TO SOLVE THEIR OWN PROBLEMS BUT WITH ITS FIRST HAND KNOWL VIIIFOREWORD EDGE OF SOCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL CONDITIONS AND OF THE ACTION AND RE ACTION OF ENVIRONMENT AND HEREDITY IT AFFORDS A VALUABLE FUND OF INFORMATION FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND THUS LAYS THE FOUNDATION FOR EFFECTIVE PROPAGANDA LOOKING TOWARD THE CREATION OF AN INTELLIGENT PUBLIC OPINION WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR ALL WISE LEGISLATION AND ESSEN TIAL FOR ALL EFFECTIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT SOCIAL CASE WORK WHEN WELL DONE IS THEREFORE NOT ONLY CONSTRUCTIVE BUT PREVENTIVE AS WELL BOTH FOR THE INDIVIDUAL AND FOR SOCIETY THE ARTICLES IN THIS VOLUME HAVE BEEN DIVIDED INTO THREE GROUPS THOSE WHICH AFFORD AN APPROACH TO SOCIAL CASE TREATMENT THOSE ARTICLES WHICH DISCUSS SOCIAL CASE WORK WITH THE PHYSICALLY OR MEN TALLY HANDICAPPED AND THOSE ARTICLES WHICH DEAL WITH SOCIAL CASE WORK WITH THE SOCIALLY HANDICAPPED THE LAST ARTICLE IN THE FIRST GROUP THE NORMAL FAMILY AFFORDS A PERSPECTIVE FOR ALL WORKERS WITH FAMILY PROBLEMS AND SO ADDS MATERIALLY TO THE VALUE AND UNITY OF THE VOLUME WHILE THERE IS NO FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE IN THE TECHNIQUE OF SOCIAL CASE WORK AS FOUND IN THE VARIOUS ARTICLES THEY DO EXHIBIT SOME ADAPTATIONS IN CASE WORK TECHNIQUE THAT ARE OF SIGNIFICANCE CERTAIN POINTS OF VIEW CHARACTERIZE ALL OR ALMOST ALL THE ARTICLES THE MANY REFERENCES TO THE WAR SHOW WHAT A BIG PLACE THIS CATACLYSM IS OCCUPYING IN THE THOUGHTS OF ALL THE WRITERS ALMOST ALL THE ARTICLES BREATHE AN IMPATIENCE WITH THE POINT OF VIEW THAT A SOCIAL CASE WORKERS JOB IS DONE WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL OR FAMILY IN QUESTION HAS BEEN HELPED THERE IS A SENSE OF HUMILITY PERVADING THE ARTICLES THOUGH EACH IS WRITTEN BY ONE CHOSEN FOR HIS OR HER WIDE EXPERIENCE IN SOCIAL CASE WORK IN HIS OR HER PARTICULAR FIELD THE THOUGHT CON STANTLY RECURS THAT WORKERS IN EACH FIELD ARE STILL BREAKING NEW GROUND ALL THE ARTICLES REFLECT A GREAT TRUTH WHICH IS CONSTANTLY BORNE IN ON ALL SOCIAL CASE WORKERS BUT OFTEN MISSED BY THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT ANY ONE PANACEA CAN REMEDY ALL OUR SOCIAL EVILS THIS TRUTH IS THAT THE CAUSES OF OUR VARIOUS SOCIAL PROBLEMS ARE EXCEED INGLY NUMEROUS VARIED AND COMPLEX SUBTILE OF ANALYSIS AND DIFFI CULT OF APPRAISEMENT AND THAT THE SOLUTIONS OF THESE PROBLEMS ARE AS MANY AND VARIED AS THE CAUSES THEMSELVES THIS MAY PROVE DIS QUIETING TO SOME IT NEVERTHELESS REMAINS TRUE THAT THERE ARE FEW IF ANY SHORTCUTS IN THE FIELD OF THE SOCIAL SCIENCES AND THAT A SYMPA THETIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR SOCIAL LIFE IS THE FIRST STEP IN ALL REAL PROGRESS FRANK D WATSON IX

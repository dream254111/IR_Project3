j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1013893,The Tomorrow of Finance,i242664,THE TOMORROW OF FINANCE BY S N PATTEN A man to whom I was quoting figures exclaimed I cannot think in terms of billions  This inability illustrates a defect in the popular thought Men educated in a particular industry can think in its terms but they become lost when a national budget is presented In most cases the situation is even worse for they think only in terms of a family budget The majority of families have not even risen to this concept but merely spend when they can and seek credit for their deficit It is no wonder that they become confused when the nations budget is presented and even with the best intentions make serious mistakes when they undertake to handle government problems Whether we will or no the national budget is in terms of billions and solutions of national problems can be found only when a budgetary view of national affairs is adopted Huge as the railroad problem is by itself it cannot be settled apart from the other problems of national finance Nor can we settle the food problem the fuel problem or the shipping problem without a like reference to the related problems each represented by its billions in national finance This popular confusion of thought is represented by the action of Congress which appropriates 20 billions for war purposes and authorizes only 4 billions of taxes Revenue measures all have this same defecta lack of realization of the magnitude of the problems to be faced It is easy to suggest means of raising 2 billions or even 4 billions of taxes The proposer thinks he has done his duty by suggesting some small increase of taxation forgetting that the deficit he leaves unprovided for will disorganize not only public credit but also private enterprise unless it is met in some adequate way If private enterprise is not to be disorganized capital must be forthcoming regularly The capital needs of the railroads have been forced upon our attention and must call for consideration under any system of government regulation control or ownership The problem of capital is but part of the larger problem of a national budget Capital can come from two sourcesprofits or savings 257THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY Latterly it has come from profits In the tomorrow of finance it must come from savings This is the issue that the railroads indeed all industrymust meet This brief introduction brings me to the heart of the problem and indicates the way the problems of national finance should be met Our railroads our food and our industry are parts of a na tional budget which we must visualize before any one issue can be adequately faced The year 1914 was the last year of normal peace conditions By contrasting the budget of this year with that of 1918 the exigencies of our present situation can be clearly seen NATIONAL BUDGET 1914 1918 Billions Billions Total production 40 Total production 70 Waste 10 Waste 18 Earned income 10 Earned income 16 Surplus 20 Increase of government expendi Annual increase of capital 2 ture 15 Annual increase of values 5 Increase of currency 3 Stock 12 Excess of exports over imports Ground rent 4 from 1914 to 1918 8 Total bank deposits 18 Decrease of stock 8 Decrease of industrial capital 2 Decrease of security values 10 Government bonds held by banks and other credit institutions 4 Total bank deposits 262 The year 1914 was a year of sound prosperity and of it the facts are well known The basis of my budget is the income of that year which is usually placed at 30 billions The addition I have made which is the only unique feature of the table is an endeavor to esti mate the waste of the year We overestimate the evils of economic stress if we do not show the economy which reduced income imposes A war budget of 10 billions does not mean a like diminu tion in national welfare The reduction of waste eases the situation and prevents acute suffering By waste I mean any loss of material which does not result in full production If the material for three suits of clothes passes into the consumers hands only as two suits there is waste If a hotel buys twice the quantity of food which the consumers get there is 258THE TOMORROW OF FINANCE waste So also is it waste if willing workers can find no employment or if they are prevented from working by unnecessary sickness Add all these maladjustments together and the sum of annual waste becomes a striking magnitude It is a modest statement to affirm that the production which does not reach the ultimate consumer plus the failure to produce which known methods could have pre vented amount to onefourth the real production Waste is not important in estimating the income of past years It is significant only as it alters the pressure which a period of national stress im poses  Far more important is the estimate of the annual amount of earned income as contrasted with the surplus enjoyed Here estimates are widely different not because the facts are in question but because of differences in opinion as to where various items should be placed The ordinary business man reckons the surplus as the amount left when the years expenses are paid He thus regards it the same as the annual increase of security values which amount to five or six billions a year A single taxer assumes it to be the same as the total amount of ground rent which is perhaps 4 billions a year Capitalists regard their interest as an earned income and professional men likewise count their earning as a payment for their costs These estimates I have discarded as expressions of personal feeling which creates a bias in each group in favor of its own form of income All the confusion about the distribution of wealth is involved in this discussion and all the uncertainty of its results If the various claims were added they would not tally with the known national income but would greatly exceed it The general result is the denial of the power of the government to make large expendi tures Each class wants its share exempted and what is left may suffice to meet the ordinary expenses of government but it is not enough to meet the expenditure of a great war Can we meet the expenses agreed to by Congress for the year 1918 No must be the answer if these class estimates are accepted Who has discov ered how to raise more than four billions on the basis he accepts It was impossible to raise the tax rates higher than they were placed so great was the pressure from many groups each with its own special interests to guard The solution is not to accept any of these pleas but to base exemptions on vital needs measured objectively The real surplus 259THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY is the difference between the amount produced and that needed to maintain the personal welfare of the population We now have accurate measures of the demands for food shelter and clothing The figures show that they are from 600 to 800 a year varying with the size of the city in which people live But this 800 for large cities represents food prices as paid in retail stores There are profits to someone on these sales and on the house rents repre senting land values Labor costs would thus be these prices minus the profits of storekeepers and landlords A fair estimate of labor costs would be about 500 a year per family or 100 a year per person A sum of 10 billion dollars a year is thus needed to sup port the population of 1914 at the prices then prevailing What is not included in these costs is surplus With it the people buy the comforts and luxuries they enjoy but which they could forego with out physical detriment if a period of national stress demanded the sums thus expended for national purposes We may there fore assume that in 1914 of the 30 billions of income 10 billions was needed for the physical welfare of the people and that 20 billions was a surplus which might be diverted to national pur poses without a lowering of the standard of life No such sacrifice of comforts and luxuries has been demanded nor is it likely to be It however represents what Germany is doing and why the German people have held out so long and so well Such suffer ing as Germany has had to endure is not the result of the reduction of income which has been demanded but of wrong estimates made at the beginning of the war The new view of food values was not accepted by the Germans at the beginning of the war As a result they killed off their live stock too rapidly and could not replace it when they found their shortage was in fats and not in proteins Such a mistake may be fatal to a blockaded nation like Germany but it does not affect America with its generous supply of all needed commodities We could feed clothe and house our people for 100 per person The rest is surplus on which the nation has a first claim Such are the problems of sustenance The increase of pros perity on which the increase of surplus depends is largely a question of the increase of capital A conservative estimate of this increase is 2 billion dollars a year This means that production exceeds consumption by this amount The sum however grows with every 260THE TOMORROW OF FINANCE improvement in the processes of production or in the utilization of the labor force These improvements add about 200 million to the surplus each year and show our rate of annual progress But far different from these estimates are those of the increase of values The increase of values is the increase of security values determined by the market price of stocks and bonds Of these prices our knowledge is fairly complete and indicates an increase of values from 4 to 6 billions a year The increase of security values is thus more than double the increase of capital as measured in stock and physi cal improvements This is due to the low rate of interest which gives high security values We have a nominal rate of interest 4 per cent in which values are estimated when the real rate is nearer 8 per cent So long as the two rates are so far apart the rapid rise of security values is inevitable The values thus made are not real but estimates based on the rate of interest We are said to be worth 200 billions but a rise of the interest rate from 4 to 5 per cent would take a quarter from these estimates The budget of 1918 represents the conditions of January 1 and is therefore subject to change as the facts of the year become more fully known The essential difference is due to the rise of prices Of this various estimates have been made varying from 60 to 100 per cent The cost of living has risen 885 per cent according to the figures of the Federal Department of Labor Agricultural produce of practically the same amounts valued at 10 billions in 1914 were valued at 21 billions at the close of 1917 It would seem therefore that an increase of 75 per cent was a conservative estimate and on this basis the money value of the national income would rise from 40 billions in 1914 to 70 billions in 1918 The figures I use for waste do not mean an increase in the amount wasted but in the value of what is wasted Rises in wages are difficult to estimate as they are different in the various occupations Unskilled labor has perhaps gained a net advantage through the rapid rise in its rate of payment but skilled labor and the lower range of salaries have gained but little Between groups as varied as they are it is hard to strike an average There can however be little doubt but that the workers and the salaried groups have as a whole suffered by the change A rise of 60 per cent is probably an overestimate of the advantage they have received On this basis the money value of the national surplus would be 261THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY about 40 billion dollars of which the government takes 15 billion in taxes and bond issues This would leave 5 billions still in the hands of producers as extra profits an estimate which is probably below the actual figures Great inroads have also been made in the stock of goods so great in fact as to change the surplus of 1914 in many cases into a deficit This shortage we are beginning to feel and will feel more severely as the year progresses The 12 billions of stock held in 1914 has been reduced to below 4 billions My estimates are based on these facts The excess of exports over imports for the three years from 1914 to 1917 inclusive was 8 billion dollars In return for this we have received about 5 billions of American securities held abroad and 3 billions in cash As there has been little or no reduction in the amount consumed the condition of today differs from that of 1914 namely in the reduction of stock Goods have gone out while securities and gold have flowed in In addition to this change there has been an actual loss of industrial capital The railroads have not kept up their rolling stock the evil effects of which we now keenly feel Manufacturers have saved by using their machines and tools for a longer time and thus reduced current expenses at the expense of the future Many factories have been transformed into military establishments which process reduces the industrial capital Such a factory must be rated not as it yields for war purposes but as it will yield when it is again put to industrial uses The income of war plants is not national income but a part of the expenses of war The loss in security values has also been equally severe The amount of securities listed on markets are estimated at 40 billions and the average decline in value has been 25 per cent thus making a loss of 10 billions in values to be added to the loss of 10 billions in goods The amount of bank deposits were 18 billions in 1914 and 26 billions in 1917 This seems a gain but if the rise in values has been 75 per cent the deposits of 1917 would purchase 6 billions less goods than would the deposits of 1914 at the prices which now pre vail These all represent prewar losses Our war expenses come under another head Of the bonds sold at least 4 billions were still in the hands of the banks or related institutions at the beginning of the year The public have promised to take much of this thus relieving the pressure on the banks but it must be done by a con 262THE TOMORROW OF FINANCE traction of expenditure on their part in the year 1918 It is a deficit weighing on national resources until these promises are ful filled The equilibrium in terms of the budget of 1914 left a surplus of 2 billions for future investment Given the same disposition to spend in 1918 an increased government expenditure of 15 billions would leave a deficit of 13 billion dollars A new equilibrium thus demands a decrease of nearly a third in personal expenditure There is little in the history of the last three years to show that measures thus far devised will produce the desired result The year 1917 shows no net decrease in personal expenditure Many have doubt less promised to save in the year 1918 but promises are valueless unless measures are devised to make them effective Were the situation merely a result of the war we might regard it abnormal and wait for peace to restore what the war has disturbed There is however much evidence that the situation is the normal outcome of farreaching changes which were manifest before the war but which have become active forces only under the pressure which the war has created Had 10 billions of extra funds been demanded at any time in the last ten years the same crisis in national finance would have occurred The reason is that there has been a sharp increase in the urgency of consumption due to the cheapening of comforts and luxuries which thus produces an increased desire to spend At the same time the increased security of salaried incomes has reduced the willingness to save An annual expenditure in the form of life insurance will give a stability to family life which a real saving fails to secure We have ceased to be a nation of savers and have become a nation of life insurers This means security and increased happiness but it does not involve that rapid increase of capital which former methods encouraged The low birth rate adds to the intensity of present expenditure and is probably its result rather than its cause But it tends to an equilibrium between expenses and income which shuts out saving There is still some saving among families whose incomes are under 1200 a year The uncertainties of work of health and of life keep active many of the older economy motives and make an annual surplus a necessity But if the class whose incomes range from 1200 to 4000 were put in a group by themselves they would probably owe society more than society owes them They have ceased to own houses for 263THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY apartment life suits them better They own automobiles but they are in debt for them They may go to high priced theaters less but they patronize motion pictures more They are well housed well clothed and enjoy summer vacations but all these add to the urgency of present expenditure and leave less room for the saving by which capital is increased If we add to this the rapid increase in display advertising and the growth of department stores we com plete the picture of the growing power of expenditure over the saving instinct These facts are not war facts but a statement of tendencies clearly evident before the war came on I have frequently called attention to them as a social change to which industry must adjust itself The war has made a crisis in that it increases national ex penditure without reducing the pressure of individual wants The growing deficit of prewar times becomes a startling fact when it is coupled with the present war expenses I say prewar deficit be cause the pressure of deficit would have been felt then if it had not been covered by the savings of the small class whose incomes exceed 5000 a year Their profits have been high leaving an excess for saving in the face of increased expenditure The rich in this sense had probably a gross income of 10 billions before the war of which they saved perhaps onequarter This would account for all the saving made at that time If people with smaller incomes had no deficit they were fortunate Certainly the class as a whole con tributed a negligible sum to the national saving Many complaints are made that all the increase of wealth goes to the rich but with the lack of motive to save it is hardly possible that it would be otherwise Only the prosperous have an income which exceeds their urgent wants Families with medium income live as they go and the workers save only to meet the exigencies arising from sick ness and nonemployment I picture this prewar situation so as to show the crisis the nation then faced The period from 1900 to 1910 were flush years in which large profits were made The industrial surplus was placed on the investment market and the rate of interest forced thereby to below 4 per cent At the same time the sources of amusement and pleasure were vastly increased making a pressure for consumption by which the income of the average family was used up The people thus ceased to save but the loss of these savings was not felt 264THE TOMORROW OF FINANCE because of the vast surplus made in the newly enlarged industries Capital thus ceased to be savings and became industrial profit The low rate of interest forced up security values to such a degree that one dollar of real capital became two dollars of values in security By 1910 the sources of the great surplus in the large industries were in a measure reduced and the supply of fresh capital fell off A check on the increase of capital was thus created which could be met in only two ways Either a higher rate of interest must be offered and popular saving evoked or higher rates must be charged so that the industrial surplus would be sufficient to permit the proper increase of capital If a higher rate of interest were offered security values would fall A 5 per cent rate instead of 4 per cent would decrease security values by a quarter Naturally this solution did not appeal to the nations financiers They chose the other plan of forcing up rates so that the increase of capital would come from the surplus thus acquired This policy is apparent in the case of railroads whose values would be most affected by a rise in interest rate Everyone is familiar with the struggle about rates between the Interstate Commerce Commission and the railroads The rates were held down The railroads refused to offer higher rates of interest stopped making improvements and practically ceased to increase their rolling stock and other equipment A crisis in rail road finance was thus approaching even if the war had not inter vened Low profits and a low rate of interest do not match One or the other must yield But the issue was put off by the war which has for the time brought high profits and has reversed the tendency for lower rates The element desiring that capital be created out of profits is again supreme and will probably remain so while the war lasts But the issue although delayed cannot be avoided A sys tem of finance that depends on profits to create new capital must move in one direction while a democracy must go in another The increase of capital as well as the expense of the war must come from high profits or from popular economy Of the former plan all are familiar since it is the method of finance on which recent prosperity has depended With democratic finance we are less familiar and to use it would reverse many wellestablished financial maxims Every reduction of the interest rate adds to the value of what the prosperous have and creates a sharper gulf between them and the less fortunate classes The less the rate the more difficult is the 265THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY advance from lower to higher social ranks It may seem that a reduced rate is of popular advantage as when the mortgage rate of interest is lowered But the advantage is to present holders only They gain by an increase of values while to others the difficulty of acquiring farms grows A low rate of interest means high farm values and a growth of tenant workers It is hard to find a locality where the rate of interest has fallen below 6 per cent without break ing up the community life of farmers and substituting in their place a much lower class of tenant farmers The problem is not solved however by dealing with a specific class no matter how important they are The real problem is what motives can be placed around a people so they will do their own saving A 4 per cent rate will not do this There never has been in the past much popular saving below a 6 per cent rate but even this rate may fail under the new pressure for increased consumption While the rate which will evoke sufficient popular saving cannot be stated the general issue may be seen by contrasting the conditions of a farming community with a 4 and an 8 per cent rate of interest An 80 acre farm with an 8 per cent rate would be worth 4000 50 an acre while with a 4 per cent rate it would be worth 8000 100 an acre If a working man can make a net saving of 100 a year and he must pay one fourth of the purchase money to buy a farm he can become a land owner in 8 years if the rate of interest is 8 per cent while it will take him 18 years to save enough to buy the farm if the rate is 4 per cent thus making the selling price 8000 of which he must pay onefourth down It is easy to see that in the first case workers will become landholders and the standards of the community will be maintained while in the second case the long wait will lead to discouragement and to the migration of the better workers to some other occupa tion There is no way in which a unified community standard can be upheld where such high values and low rates of interest persist A social split is sure to occur dividing the community into a leisure class and a large mass of dependent workers The same tendencies show themselves in industrial occupations although it is not so easy to contrast the motives which operate to discourage one class and to give advantage to the other But democracy demands the same in both cases and the solution is not different Suppressed motives must be evoked and the obstructions to social unification set aside To make the bearing of these statements plain it is necessary 266THE TOMORROW OF FINANCE to define more clearly the meaning of an economic democracy An economic aristocracy is a society where the capitalists are a self perpetuating class distinct from the workers both in occupation and in motive Capital once saved is perpetuated and gives to its holder advantages denied to other classes Low rates of interest with extraordinary inducements for individual enterprise are the basis of this condition The high personal rewards give the basis of large fortunes and the low rates of interest stop the growth of competing capital In contrast to these conditions a democratic economy is one in which privileges do not endure All personal advantage is slowly reduced so that in time any family or class loses its industrial superiority and sinks back to the common level from which it must take a fresh start if its advantages are to be renewed From shirt sleeve to shirt sleeve in three generations is an old adage which has a social significance if it means that the superior energy of one generation does not lift a family into a selfperpetuating leisure class The adage implies that the descendents will be extravagant and thus lose their superiority Socially however the advantage should not be lost in this way but by conditions which prevent the selfperpetuation of capital This selfperpetuation is now favored because it is believed to be the only means by which an adequate supply of capital can be obtained But the need of this perpetuation depends on the rate at which new capital is secured Low rates of interest check the increase of new capital while high rates encourage it The problem of democratic finance is to get a rate of interest which will produce a growth of new capital large enough to supply an increasing industry and to replace the decrease which is actually taking place in old capital If for example old capital decreased at the rate of 2 per cent a year while an increase of 3 per cent a year was demanded to supply the increasing need of industry the annual increase of new capital must be at least 5 per cent a year If this condition were brought about we would have democratic finance and the permanance of class distinctions would cease Everyone would be permitted to gain whatever advantages his superior advantages permitted but what he left to his heirs would not be a selfperpetuating fund it would be merely an annuity which would finally disappear The difficulty is not in preventing this selfperpetuation but to secure the requisite capital to take its place We now think of 267THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY capital as a permanent fund and do not realize how an industrial system could work without it The advantage of capital now seems to lie in elevating ones family into the leisure class A democratic view would not be this but the creation of a period of economic leisure for ones old age We realize the advantage of limiting the hours of labor in each day but we do not in a similar way see the advantage of limiting the years of labor We stop work at 5 pm but we do not stop industrial activity at sixty This lack of a social concept is largely due to the shortness of life in the past and to its uncertainty Just as men were glad to get work they were glad to work until they dropped dead The decrease of disease and the growth of sounder views of life permit us to think of a thirtyyear working period as we now think of an eighthour day Should this view become prevalent a new attitude about saving would result Men would save freely during their working period and spend freely in their old age Their capital would become an annuity and not a permanent fund Each generation would supply the capital for its successor who in turn would save for those which follow A con tinuous destruction and replacement of capital would result with no permanent class enjoying its advantage The old would lend to the young and the young would save for their old age leisure The longer life and the better living are now realities and will engage more attention no matter what financial system we use The choice is between low rates of interest with a permanent leisure class and high rates with democratic saving by the whole population The heredity of the upper and lower classes are not different It is conditions which evoke saving habits and they may be made general by calling them into activity with the proper inducements When a region is new and capital scarce there is no difficulty to arouse the proper amount of saving It is when the inducement fails because of low interest rates that the division into classes appears If taxation had prevented this selfperpetuation of capital the general inclination to save would have continued and fresh cap ital would have appeared each year to replace that lost by taxation A democratic society must think more of its health more of the length of life and more of leisure both in old age and from day to day It must be a working organization active and efficient but it cannot afford to be 100 per cent efficient in work atd only 20 per cent efficient in its amusement recreation and leisure Production 268THE TOMORROW OF FINANCE and consumption must complement each other and each bring its joys Democracy is a manysided life and not an alley leading to a single goal These statements I assume will be accepted in a vague way by most people who read them We have become so used to the presentation of Utopias that we read of them with pleasure and for get them with equal readiness It is only as they are transformed into facts that they become realities for the realization of which practical plans may be devised I shall try to do this by presenting figures which show how the ends desired may be reached We must begin this with a study of the prosperous for it is with changes in their attitudes that we are mainly concerned We are as a class quite willing to lecture the workers but we do not take home the lessons taught Many budgets have been presented of workers and we know fairly well of the merits and defects of their expenditure We lack a like picture of the upper middle class whose expenditures are more than any other factor the cause of the present situation and the obstacle to its improvement I shall present not the usual budget of the workers which visualizes the minimum of necessities needed by working families but a budget of those whose expendi tures represent the lower limit of good living These good livers represent the tendencies of the prosperous and the pressure to spend forced on them by the social life they enjoy In the cost of an automobile I have included depreciation charges A 1200 automobile run by the owner will cost him 300 a year on this basis The rule for wise insurance is that the income to be derived from it should equal half the family income THE MINIMUM OF GOOD LIVING ANNUAL BUDGET Rent  800 Summer expenses  300 Automobile  300 Amusement  200 Service  300 Generosity  200 Clothing  300 Taxes  100 Food   600 Extras  200 Household expenses 100 Insurance  600 Total  4000 The defect in this budget is not from the personal but from the social viewpoint The comforts of life are provided for but there is no pressure to encourage thrift Such a standard is therefore in 269THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY complete and undemocratic It is incomplete in that the thrift instinct must be aroused to make a normal man A thriftless man is as liable to degeneration as is a man who does not work Such families however pleasant and wholesome sink in intelligence and vital power They are also undemocratic because if they do not save there must be a capitalistic class to perform this function and back of them a predatory class to amass the fortunes which the capitalist class inherit Only when energy and thrift are combined and simultaneously evoked will a democratic family appear which is thus independent and selfdetermining To bring this about a thrift item must be added to their budget and thrift motives evoked by a sufficing rate of interest The working epoch of each man should be followed by a period of leisure in old age During the working period he saves in old age he spends What sum of annual saving will give a thirtyyear period of work and saving coupled with a period of twenty years leisure in old age If the sum of this saving sufficed to keep up the capital of the country there would then be a replacing capital instead of the permanent fund now sought There could then be fresh capital saved each generation to replace the spending of their predecessors of the past generation Capital in one sense would be permanent for enough would always be at hand but it would be temporary in the sense that the capital of each generation would go as they go To bring this about would demand an annual saving of 400 a year if the rate of interest remained at 4 per cent while an annual saving of 200 a year would suffice if the rate of interest was 8 per cent It is plain that 400 a year of saving would exceed present possibilities while a saving of 200 a year is practicable If the actual return on capital is now 8 per cent there is no external obstacle to an unified democratic society It is the thriftpressure which we need and this cannot be evoked while the rate of interest remains at 4 per cent Such a picture the reader may regard as picturesque if he will It is not this which I have primarily in mind but to show the dilemma in which the nation is at the present time We have had in the past a society more or less predatory in its nature The gains of the few were at the expense of the many and out of these gains came the capital of the nation The good liver is an adjunct and com pleted product of this epoch But against this regime the people 270THE TOMORROW OF FINANCE 271 have of late revolted and pressure has been put in ways which have reduced profits However capital came from these high profits and with their reduction comes a failure to supply the capital needed for industrial enterprise This restrictive economy is thus bound to fail The check to the increase of capital must be obviated either by a return to the epoch of high individual profit or by pushing on to a more democratic society in which the people do their own sav ing Such a choice the American people face and to which they will turn I cannot say But I can say that a policy of restriction will not work I can also say that a more fully democratic society is a prac tical expedient if the mental attitude of the people is altered to meet the new situation The struggle of coming years is thus not a struggle with nature but a struggle of conflicting motives Our democratic ideals may become real forces or a keen desire for good living may keep active the forces on which our social class distinc tions depend

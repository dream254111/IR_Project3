theory of Germinal Selection a modification of Wilhelm Rouxs idea of the principle of selection as applied to the parts of organismsthe struggle of the parts Weismann reviews the whole status of the prob lem of the efficacy of natural selection attacks the doctrines of internal formative laws and of internal motive forces in evolution ascribing all impulse and guidance in the choice of variations to utility Establishing the efficacy of selection by what he deems indisputable evidence he contends nevertheless that natural selection does not explain a very important crux of evo lution viz why the useful variations are always present Something is wanting to the selection of persons and that missing agency is supplied by germinal selection which the author claims is the last consequence of the application of the principle of Malthus to living nature and has its roots in the necessity of putting something else in the place of the Lamarckian principle which is declared to be inadequate His treat ment of the views of American inquirers on this point shows a higher appreciation of the strength of their position than we are accustomed to ex pect from European critics In opposition thereto however he maintainsand here the whole burden of his objection reststhat since degeneration takes place in superfluous parts having only passive and not active functions as in the chitinous parts of the skeleton of Arthro poda therefore it is certain that the cessation of functional action is not the efficient cause of degeneration It is a curious and instructive circumstance that he grounds his arguments upon the same facts as his opponents viz on the facts of artificial selection He repudiates the charge that his germ elements are modern ized reproductions of Bonnets preformations and also argues for the simplicity of his theory of the constitution of the germinal substance as compared with that of Spencer The mechanism of the selection and survival of the plus and minus determinants in Weismann s theory of the germinal battle for life is that of oscillations of the nutrient supply and of the active as well as passive assimilative powers of the struggling particles In the last article On the Nature of Mathe matical Knowledge Prof H Schubert of Ham burg shows the varying degrees of certainty attainable in the different branches of mathe matics as compared with each other and with the remaining sciences and points out the lead ing features by which mathematical thought is distinguished from other rational processes Prof Henry F Osborn reviews the late Mr Romaness PostDarwinian Questions Other im portant works in science and philosophy also receive critical discussion SOCIETIES AND ACADEMIES BIOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON 253D MEETING SATURDAY JANUARY 11 GERRIT S MILLER read by title a paper on the Subgenera of voles Microtinw T S Palmer spoke on Rabbit Drives in the West illustrating his remarks with lantern slides He alluded to the great destruction caused by the introduction of rabbits into New Zealand and Australia and the efforts to check their increase and described the damage to fruit and other crops in California The drives were undertaken with the object of reducing the numbers of the rabbits and the principal locality where they were held was in the San Joaquin valley The method was practiced on a limited scale by the Indians as far back as 1839 but the first of the modern drives by whites took place at Pixley Cal in November 1887 The principle of a drive was as follows A corral or pen of some kind was built with wing fences leading from it for a long distance like a funnel and a multitude of people who assemble in response to notices and advertise ments form a line and drive the rabbits toward this trap The line may be several miles in length and it is formed some distance from the pen The rabbits which try to double on the line are killed with clubs and when the others have been driven into the trap gates areshut and all clubbed to death The number de stroyed in 208 drives including under this head the shotgun hunts of Colorado and Utah was 459000 the average per drive being about 2200 the greatest number killed at any one time was in March 1892 at Fresno Cal SCIENCE 139140 SCIENCE when 8000 people participated and 20000 rab bits were taken Rabbit driving has declined in the San Joa quin Valley during the last three years but is now being actively prosecuted in northeastern California and in certain parts of Oregon and Idaho while thousands of rabbits are killed an nually in the Colorado and Utah hunts Drives can only be used in the case of Jack rabbits which do not burrow but under favorable cir cumstances afford a most efficient means of keeping the animals in check Dr V A Moore read a paper on The Nature of the Flagella of Motile Bacteria with special reference to their value in differentiating species The paper was a summary of the present knowledge of the nature and significance of the flagella or organs of locomotion of motile bac teria A method seems not to have yet been formulated whereby uniform results can be obtained by different investigators This fact renders the assertions of a few writers that the flagella are of specific diagnostic value some what questionable The test of the differential importance of these filaments was applied to Baccillus coli communis B typhosis and B chol eri suis three species of bacteria closely related morphologically but readily differentiated by means of physiological properties and their pathogenesis The differences in the flagella of each of these species as found by different observers are as great as those found between the different species The same is true of the Spirilla The proposed classification of bacteria by Messea was shown by illustration to be of secondary importance and the statements here tofore made concerning the specific value of the flagella were shown to be unreliable The author favored the disposition of the flagella as polar or diffuse made by A Fisher who in cludes them in the characters of his subfamilies F A LUcAS Secretary NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SOCIETY AT the regular Friday evening meeting of the National Geographic Society held in Washing ton D C January 10 Mr Wm Ellery Curtiss of Washington delivered a lecture illustrated by lantern slides on Venezuela N S VOL III No 56 her government people and boundary The lecturer who was formerly Chief of the Bureau of American Republics discussed the form of government and institutions of the country and the character manners and cus toms of the people He dwelt particularly however on the boundary question in certain of its phases and set forth both the British and American contentions in the pending dispute GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON AT the fortieth meeting of the Society on January 9th the first paper read was by Mr R T Hill of the U S Geological Survey On the Agassiz Expedition to Panama and Costa Rica Mr Hill gave results and methods of studies of the geological structure paleontology and geo morphology of the Isthmus of Panama based upon observations made by him last yearwhen under a furlough from the Survey he spent sev eral months in the work under the auspices of Prof Alexander Agassiz Mr Hill supple mented his remarks by calling attention to the great work Prof Agassiz is doing for science in working out the geology of Tropical America a region having the greatest bearing upon the in terpretation of our whole continental history The speaker made acknowledgment to the following specialists who had determined for him the many different types of material enter ing into this complicated section To Dr Wm H Dall of the Geological Survey for a report upon the Tertiary mollusca to Prof R M Bagg of Johns Hopkins University for in teresting determinations of the Tertiary For aminifera to Prof J E Wolff of Cambridge to whom the petrographic specimens were as signed to Mr H W Turner of the Geological Survey for minute examination of certain im portant and apparently indeterminate earths to Mr Ahc Sjogren of Stockholm Sweden late of Costa Rica for carefully prepared sections and collections and to Mr T Wayland Vaughan of the U S Geological Survey for determination of the fossil corals The reports of these specialists together with Mr Hills discussion of the structure history and physical geography have been prepared and are nearly ready for publication Three geologic sections of the Central AmeriSCIENCE can region were presented by the speaker The first of these was across the continent along the line of the Panama Canal and Railway This consists of a complicated plexus of marine sedi mentaries Eocene and Miocene Tertiaries igne ous rocks basalts augite porphyrites augite andesite trachitic tufa rhyolitic tufa and other species and ancient detritial formations so con cealed by dense vegetation and soil the sub aereal decay which reaches to 100 feet or more in depth and confused by structural disturb ance that its history is most difficult to inter pret Another section was given across the Re public of Costa Rica from Punta Arenas to Port Limon showing the contrasts between the high plateau of recent volcanic activity and the older phenomena of Panama The third section was from the Caribbean coast to the high mountain summits in southern Costa Rica It is impos sible to give here the great amount of detail which these sections throw upon the petrog raphy paleontology orogeny and geomorphol ogy of this exceedingly interesting region and present for the first time any comprehensive detail by which its history may be discussed The discussion of the time of the union of the continents was intentionally deferred to the final report owing to the fact that it is so in volved in hypothetical discussion by naturalists that the subject requires separate treatment The Isthmus said the speaker entirely aside from this question of the union of the oceans is of the greatest geologic interest For the information of the Department of the Interior and under special instructions from the Secretary Mr George H Eldridge has just made an investigation of the principal mineral resources of the Uncompahgre Indian Reserva tion in northeastern Utah and has submitted his report through the director of the Geological Survey Mr Eldridge contributed an interest ing account of Uintaite or Gilsonite the prin cipal resource found and investigated His paper will be printed in this journal Prof Chas D Walcott entertained the So ciety briefly with the presentation and informal discussion of two series of lanternslide views The larger series represented some recent and ancient markings on the sea shore and showed the results of experiments and observations 141 made by him quite recently on the beach at Noyes Point Rhode Island and on the Florida coast The observations while of interest in other respects were presented more particu larly as illustrating some supposed errors in the interpretation that observers have placed upon certain seashore markings He illustrated among other things an excellent cast of a me dusa or jelly fish one of several of which casts he had succeeded in making in plaster of paris while on the Florida coast The other slides represented the mode of formation of sand dunes as observed on the Rhode Island coast W F MORSELL THE ANTHROPOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON THE 242 meeting of the Society was held on January 7 A paper on A Vigil of the Gods was read by Dr Washington Matthews U S A of which the following is an abstract The rites occur on the fourth night of a great ninedays ceremony of the Navahoes called the nightchant which is based on a myth and many of the acts are illustrative of the mythic events The night from about 9 P M until daylight is devoted to a vigil analogous to that of the mediaeval knight over his armor Men and gods or the properties which represent the gods alike participate in the vigil and there is a feast in common or lovefeast closely resemb ling certain ceremonial acts observed among our own people today Although there are interesting rites the night is spent mostly in song and many long prayers are repeated The songs and prayers are care fully formulated ritualistic compositions The masks of twentyone gods and goddesses of the Navaho pantheon along with other sa cred properties are spread on a buffalo robe in an established order and frequent sacrifices of pollen are made to them Early in the night dishes of wild herbs and seeds such as formed the food of the Navahoes in the old days before they became farmers and herders are brought in sung over and eaten by those who choose to partake The lovefeast comes later This consists of cold cornmeal gruel or thin mush prepared in JANUARY 24 1896142 SCIENCE a watertight wicker bowl with many cere monial observances The bowl is passed around sunwise and everybody helps himself with his fingers to four morsels But before the men partake the gods are feda morsel of gruel is laid on the mouth of each mask After the gruel is finished all partake of pollen About midnight the ceremony of waking the gods begins Although the Navahoes do not use timepieces this act occurs alvays almost ex actly at midnight The shaman sings a long song the burden of which is Hyidezna he stirs he moves a different god is mentioned in each stanza When the singer mentions the name of a god he lifts the appropriate mask and shakes it in tune to the song The last prayer occurs after dawn the vigil ends and the lodge is prepared for the work of the fifth day The paper closed by giving the reasons for certain Navaho symbolisms especially that which assigns the north to the male and the south to the female The closing paper on Racial Anatomical Pecu liarities was read by DR D K SHUTE GEORGE R STETSON Recording Secretary NEW YORK ACADEMY OF SCIENCES IN the absence of the President the meeting was called to order by Prof R S Wood ward The minutes were read and approved and Dr Franz Boas of the American Museum of Natural History was elected resident mem ber Twentysix members and guests were present Prof M I Pupin then read before the Section of Astronomy and Physics a paper on the Magnetic circuit In transformers especially of closed iron core it has long been known that the upper  harmonics of the fun damental rate of alternations present in the pri mary are choked out by the transformer leav ing the potential difference of the secondary coil represented by a simple sine curve The choking out is less if the magnetic circuit is incomplete and least when the coils have no magnetic core Various explanations have been offered to account for this phenomenon it is doubtless true that it is due to Foucault currents and to hysteresis Dr Pupin pointed out from certain mathematical considerations N S VOL II No 56 that by appropriate measurements especially of the angle of lag it would be possible to sep arate the energy consumed in Foucault cur rents from that consumed by hysteresis and thus be able to study this latter puzzling phe nomenon Investigations are in progress to test the method experimentally Prof Crocker remarked upon the interest and importance of the questions involved The second paper was by Dr A A Julien upon  The condensed gas film on the surface of solid bodies with relation to 1 Newtons rings of the first order 2 sand flotation 3 sand in harmonic vibration Owing to the lateness of the hour Dr Julien passed over the first two heads giving an out line of the literature of the question of liquid films on solids He then outlined his experi ments in sonorizing sands artificially and dem onstrating the necessity of an antecedent water film before the sand becomes sonorous It must also be of approximately uniform size of grain The paper was discussed by Profs Mayer Van Nardroff Pupin and Hallock At 1030 the meeting adjourned W HALLOCK Secretary of Section GEOLOGICAL CONFERENCE OF HARVARD UNI VERSITY DECEMBER 17 1895 The Geology of the Woonsocket Basin Prelimi nary Report By F C SCHRADER The basin consists of a local widening in the normally trenchant valley of the Blackstone River where the river traverses a narrow belt of soft rocks The outline of the basin is roughly that of the crosssection of a plano convex lens whose straight edge representing the southeast side of the basin extends from Primrose south of Woonsocket Hill in Rhode Island ten miles northeastward to South Bel lingham in Massachusetts The convex edge includes near its middle point Blackstone village on the northwest whence the Blackstone river like a vertical let fall to the opposite side just below the city of Woonsocket bisects the basin whose width is here about three miles The rocks in the basin are eroded to a depth of two hundred or more feet below the upland or old baselevel of the surrounding country Some bedrock hills are however still prominentJANUARY 24 1896 within the basin and the deposits of glacial drift chiefly waterlaid frequently approach a hundred feet in thickness The rocks enclosing the basin are mainly gneisses hornblende granites and on the west some quartzites Excepting a few of the gran ites they are all PreCarboniferous and extend over wide areas of country They have a south eastnorthwest trend and the gneisses and quartzites dip to the northeast as seen in the Manville section and at Woonsocket Hill Com pared to the rocks within the basin they are hard and form good resisters to weathering To this difference of resistance to weathering between the extra and the intrabasin rocks the basin doubtless mainly owes its present topography The rocks within the basin are soft have a southwestnortheast trend and dip northwest They are much younger than the enclosing rocks with which they exhibit marked unconformities as with the quartzites on the west and the gneis ses on the north The lowest and apparently oldest of these rocks but of unknown age is a uniformly very fine grained grey talcose silicious micaschist which in the past has been worked with profit in the whetstone industry It occurs chiefly in the southeast side of the basin Above this grey rock but unconform able with it in the west part of the basin is found a shiny black hornblende micaschist also of questionable age while unconformably over both the grey and the black lie the youngest rocks in the basin These latter though as yet they have yielded no fossils are probably Carboniferous judging from their geological relations and lithologic resemblance to the wellknown Carboniferous on the east in the Narragansett Basin They consist of grey conglomerates with interbedded mica schists sandstones and slates They are de rived chiefly from the surrounding older rocks of the upland as is manifest by the granite and quartzite pebbles contained in the conglom erates occurring east of Forestdale and at Woonsocket Hill Cutting the rocks in the basin at intervals is a series of diabase dikes They range from less than one to more than a hundred feet in width dip about vertical and run nearly parallel bearing northnortheast Preliminary Report on the Stamford Gneiss By W H SNYDER In the southwestern part of Vermont and ex tending into tte northwestern part of Massa chusetts there occurs a coarse banded gneiss covering about 50 square miles and called by the U S Geological Survey the Stamford Gneiss It was known in Pres Hitchcocks survey of Vermont as the Stamford Granite This gneiss is surrounded on the east and south by a metamorphosed conglomerate the pebbles of which correspond to the blue quartz of the gneiss At a short distance from the contact the conglomerate changes into a mica ceous quartzite In this quartzite there has been found by Walcott trilobites which prove it to be Cambrian On the west the gneiss ap pears to be bounded by a very massive white quartzite the dip and strike of which mostly correspond to that of the micaceous quartzite on the east The northern boundary is as yet undetermined At the contact of the conglomerate and gneiss there is developed between the two a layer of about a foot in thickness in which the gneissic structure is particularly pronounced the mica making lenticular folds around the quartz grains and giving the mass the appearance of augen gneiss Prof Pumpelly has suggested that this layer is the disintegrated border of the gneiss upon which the conglomerate was laid down and which has since been metamorphosed The gneiss itself is composed of coarse feld spar crystals irregular masses of blue quartz and thin layers of a greenish mica In some parts there are large Carlsbad twins of microcline and in others rounded masses of feldspar 3 and 4 inches in diameter At one point the weather ing has developed nodular feldspar aggregates as large as a hens egg which give the face of the ledge a conglomeratic appearance The rocks yield easily to weathering throughout the area There are no glacial striae apparent upon any exposed surface Near the western border of the gneiss there is an outcrop of a fine grained greenish gneiss very distinct from that of the main mass and surrounded on three sides by this mass The fourth side is hidden by a bog The Stam ford gneiss apparently overlies this gneiss and SCIENCE 143144 SCIENCE sends apophyses into it The contact between the two is distinctly marked and although a careful microscopical examination has not as yet been made it does not appear to be a meta morphic contact due to stretching but an igneous contact the Stamford gneiss having covered when in a melted condition the green gneiss The Stamford gneiss is apparently a granite which has had the gneissic character impressed upon it The general occurrence composition and structure of the Stamford gneiss corresponds very closely with the Rapakiwi granite of Finn land described by J J Sederholm in Tscher maks Mineralogische und Petrographische Mittheilungen Band XII pages 131 1891 Ueber die Finnlandischen Rapakiwigesteine DECEMBER 10 1895 Preliminary Notes on the North Jersey Coast J EDMUND WOODMAN Three important causes of change are now in operation heresubmergence recession and ad vance The first is widespread but immeasur able The evidence relevant to this is varied but chiefly the presence of stumps in salt and brackish water Deepening of inlets affords no criterion Recession is effected by 1 waves and 2 cur rents On Sandy Hook and south of Manas quan inlet this is replaced by advance or grade hence these are nodal points This recession is measurable and nay be prophesied approxi mately for any specified time within certain limits It can be temporarily prevented at iso lated points although not by present methods but its ultimate conquest is sure The waves act 1 by eroding the shore 2 by damming inlets and 3 by transporting ma terial off shore to form bars Erosion is irreg ular and in places erosion and advance alter nate and partially compensate Cutting is greatest with a northeast windi e when wind and current are in opposition it is least with a southeast wind This is contrary to gen eral theory but is readily explainable The damming of inlets is caused partly by coastwise bars raised by the waves and partly by sediment from the streams falling in the dead water where current and waves meet Probably the former N S VOL III No 56 cause does not operate until some sedimentation has taken place Most of the sand eroded from the shore is carried a few hundred feet out to form bars little migrating along the margin of the land The currents act 1 by carrying a small amount of sand along shore as mentioned 2 by the migration of bars northwardthe most important method of transportation and as a result 3 by deposition of most or all thesand on Sandy Hook T A JAGGAR JR Recording Secretary THE

ROSWELL B OHARRA of Illinois ALLEN M REED of Illinois WILL R ROBERTS of Michigan HENRY ROTTSCHAEFER of Michigan CARL G SCHOEFFEL of Illinois J G TUCKER JR of Michigan NOTE AND COMMENT THE USE OF MULTIPLES IN DETERMINING THE VALUE OF RAILROAD LANDS The case of Chicago  N W Ry Co v Smith et al decided by the United States District Court for the District of South Dakota and reported in 2Io Fed 632 contains an interesting suggestion as to the means to be employed in determining the value of lands used for railway purposes which was not however accepted by the court Property devoted to a public service occupies a peculiar place in the sphere of property law the very fact that it ihas been put to a use in which the public has an interest renders it liable to public control a control which extends to the power of regulating the rates that may be charged for its use Munn v Illinois 94 U S II3 At the time when the problem first assumed some measure of importance it was considered that this power of regulation was exclusively a legislative one and that the exercise by the legislature of this power precluded the courts from interference They were thought to be powerless to prevent an abuse of this power by the legislature After some uncertainty in the courts on this point the doctrine of the right of judicial review finally prevailed and it became the settled law that the courts had the right to declare the exercise of this power by the legislature invalid asNOTE AND COMMENT being in contravention of the constitutional provision against depriving a person of property without due process of law Spring Valley Water Works v Schottler no U S 347 Railroad Commission Cases 116 U S 307 Chi M  St P Ry Co v Minn 134 U S 418 IOnce this doctrine had been established it became essential to determine just what would consti tute a taking of property without due process of law It was at once recog nized that this was intimately connected with the question of the value of such property and the rate of return that would be allowed on such value Consequently whether or not property is being taken without due process of law is soon made to depend upon whether or not the regulations imposed resulted in depriving the owner thereof of a fair rate of return on its fair value Smyth v Ames I69 U S 466 San Diego Land  Town Co v Na tional City I74 U S 739 But it is apparent that this rule itself raises diffi cult questions both in the matter of its practical application and in the matter of the theoretical problems that it raises These difficulties have centered about the determination of what constitutes fair value and what constitutes a fair rate of return By far the most difficult of these problems have arisen in connection with the former of these questions The particu lar problem presented in the following discussion is merely one of the many that have come up In view of the fact that it has now been definitely and have obtained some measure of legal recognition namely the actual settled that in most cases the question is a judicial one it must be to the de cisions of the courts on thesepoints that one must look for an answer to the various questions so raised It is the settled rule that as a general thing public service companies are entitled to earn a fair rate of return on the fair value of the property being devoted to a public use and that such fair value is the value of the property at the time that it is ibeing so used for the public benefit Smyth v Ames I69 U S 466 This rule however is little more than the statement of the general outlines of the problem and leaves unanswered the question as to the method that is to be used to determine such present value Various answers hnave been given to this question the most important of which may be summed up in the various theories of valuation that have been proposed and have obtained some measure of legal recognition namely the actual cost theory Brymer v Butler Water Co I79 Pa 231 the market value theory and the cost of reproduction less depreciation theory San Diego Land  Tozw Co v National City 74 Fed 79 Knoxville v Knoxville Water Co 212 U S I For a general discussion of the various legal theories for de termining present value see Advance in RatesEastern Case 2o I C C Rep 243 at pp 260263 If either the actual cost or cost new theories be adopted the question as to what shall be considered legitimate elements in cost arises and in connection with each of such recognized elements the further problem emerges as to the methods to be used in determining their value The question relative to the use of multiples in valuing the right of way of railroads is merely a particular case of this larger problem Before proceeding to discuss this problem it may be well to state it as it has pre sented itself in the court for solution I45MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW Up to the present time there have been very few cases in which the prob lem has heen directly faced The most prominent of these are the Minnesota Rate Cases both as reported in I84 Fed 765 and later in 230 U S 352 and the principal case In order to present the problem as it appeared to the court in the former of these cases it may be best to summarize the courts view as reported at pp 442 td 450 First the value of contiguous property was determined To this was added a sum to cover excess which the rail road would have to pay over the market value of contiguous and similar property if it were called upon to undertake such a reproduction of its right of way These supposed additional outlays he the witness for the railroad undertook to estimate For this purpose he increased the market value as stated in the case of agricultural lands generally multiplying by 3 and thus reached the amount set down as the value for railway purposes In the latter case at pp 636 to 639 the value of contiguous property was determined This was called the market value The values so reached were multiplied by 2r2 to determine the cost of reproduction value for the purpose of giving the actual cost to the company of acquiring them under present conditions From these cases it is apparent that the general features of the method are the taking of the value of contiguous property as a base and applying a multiple to this base for the purpose of reaching such a figure as will represent the actual cost to the railroads of acquiring the right of way under present conditions Before discussing the legitimacy of this proceeding the legal status of the method in so far as it has been passed upon must be stated In the Minnesota Rate Cases their use was rejected al though there may be some doubt as to whether this was done on principle for the purpose of laying down a general rule that the method was illegitimate or whether because of the fact that the railroads had not made out a suffi ciently strong case to warrant their use in the particular case then before the court In the latter case however though commenced before the decision in the Minnesota Rate Cases in the United States Supreme Court had been announced was decided later it was also decided not to allow their use It is perhaps too early to consider the problem as one definitely settled in the law but in so far as the actually decided cases furnish any clue to the probable ultimate solution it would seem that the chances of allowing their use are not very favorable As was stated in the preceding paragraph the attempt to use the multiples is an effort to apply the cost new theory to its fullest measure to the problem of right of way values It is apparent from the statement of the purpose sought to be accomplished thereby that it is based upon an assumption that it would actually cost the railroads this excess to acquire the property today Tlhis is an assumption of fact whose legitimacy can be tested only by an appeal to experience In support of this assumption of fact is the testimony of the various witnesses for the railroads quoted in the cases now under discussion It would also seem to be the opinion of persons familiar with actual experience in connection with the problem There are various reasons given for this state of affairs A brief summary of these is essential to an understanding of the problem and for this purpose it may be well to quote I46NOTE AND COMMENT from an expert on railroad valuation Thus with a railroad right of way the continuity of the strip of lands the severance of lands crossed by it the greater earning power it derives from the constructions placed upon it in short the uses to which it can be put give it a value far in excess of adjoining lands    In making these figures the appraiser was forced to the follow ing conclusions That the added value for railroad purposes is due to three elements continuity severance or damages and changed earning power all of which the farmer or owner has cognizance of in making his price H E RIGGS THE VALUATION OF PUBLIC SERVICE CORPORATION PROPERTY 5455 But even if it be admitted that as a matter of fact railroads are com pelled to pay a price in excess of market value of contiguous lands for farm ing or other purposes in such cases where the transactions are voluntary ones between the parties it does not necessarily follow even on the assump tion of the cost new theory that it should be allowed As the court says in the Minnesota Rate Cases referring to the use of multiples for such purpose It is apparent at once that in so far as the estimate rests upon the supposed compulsory feature of the acquisition it cannot be allowed for It the railroad is equipped with the governmental power of eminent domain In view of its public purpose it has been granted this privilege to pre venit advantage being taken of its necessities Whether therefore the use of multiples is essential even on the basis of the cost new theory depends upon whether the elements that would be taken into consideration in deter mining the value of the lands in condemnation proceedings by the railroad are the same as those that would be considered in a voluntary transaction between the parties in respect to the same lands No proper answer can be given to this question until it has been determined what are proper elements in arriving at the value of lands Wihat the party selling is entitled to is the fair market value of the property sold and as a general thing compensation to the owner is to be estimated by reference to the uses for which the property is available Boom Co v Patterson 98 U S 403 In connection with the particular problem in hand the controversy centers about the right to include in reaching such value the particular value for railroad purposes and if this is to be allowed about the extent to which it should be con sidered The extent to which it would be legitimate to consider it would certainly be limited by the rule against allowing speculative factors to be considered Chi B  Q R Co v Chicago I66 U S 226 but it would no doubt be included to the extent that the possibility of its use for that purpose had gone beyond the domain of the purely speculative and found expression in the actual market value of the property in question U S v ChandlerDunbar Co 229 U S 3 To the extent therefore that a proper consideration of the elements out of which this excess value for railroad purposes arises is permitted in condemnation proceedings and to the extent that these would result in a price in excess of the value of contiguous lands for other purposes a strict application of the cost new theory would war rant a valuation in excess of the value of contiguous property and conse quently would warrant the use of a proper multiple to arrive at sudh a value I47MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW It may be well at this point to remark that it is not so much a question as to whether the cost new theory as opposed to the actual cost theory shall be applied in this field but rather a question as to the extent to which the cost new theory shall be used For it is generally held that regardless of the actual cost of such lands their present value shall be allowed in rate cases in so far as such present value is reflected in the value of contiguous property Wilcox v Con Gas Co 212 U S 19 This is generally allowed on the theory that public service companies shall be allowed to share in the prosperity of the community as well as private individual landholders It may be doubted however whether if the facts are such that such companies pay more than the ordinary market value they are sharing in such prosperity in tlhe same degree unless the same rate of excess is allowed in reaching present value of the land factor that represented the actual excess at the time it was purchased But there is even some question as to whether they shall be allowed this increase in the values of their lands under all circum stances The case cited above remarks This is at any rate the general rule We do not say there may not be an exception to it where the property may have increased so enormously in value as to render a rate permitting a reasonable return upon such increased value unjust to the public The same problem was discussed but not decided in Spokane v N P Ry Co I5 I C C R 376 and in the Advance in RatesWestern Case 20 I C C R 307 340 In the latter of these cases it is stated If ithe position of the Burling ton is sound and is an expression of what the courts will hold to be the law then as we are told there is certainly the danger that we may never expect railroad rates to be lower than they are at present On the contrary there is the unwelcome promise made lin this case that they will certainly advance If then even without the use of multiples such dire consequences are to be expected the consequences involved in permitting the use of multiples can only be imagined in this connection Such is one of the many difficult problems that the courts have had to confront in working out justice in the matter of rates between the public service companies and the public There can be no doubt that they have been guided in their work by considerations of the best public policy For the problem is one that is connected in the most intimate measure with the problem of securing the proper development of a large branch of economic life and activity As such it presents rather a problem of laying down lines for the future development than a question of past policy As long as the country is equipped with less than its fair complement of transporta tion facilities with the consequent necessity of a further development along this line the courts must recognize that the Imanner of treatment dictated by considerations of public policy must be such as will result in securing such a development And is impossible unless the conditions are made favorable for attracting to those industries sufficient enterprise and capital to undertake this development And this will in a large measure depend upon the extent to which property in those lines receives the same considera tion that is given property in other lines of industry It is at this point that the necessity of a proper solution of the various questions connected I48NOTE AND COMMENT with the valuation of public utility properties finds its crux and it is consid erations such as these that must for a long time continue to have a decisive influence in determining the rulesl of law connected with Isuch problems H R JURISDICTION OF STATI COURTS IN SUITS COMMENCED BY RCEIVERS AP POINIED BY FEDERAL COURTSIn Delano et al Receivers of Wabash Railroad Company v MalcomsonHoughten Coal Company Mich 1914 2I Detroit Legal News 905 the plaintiffs had been appointed Receivers of the Wabash Railroad Company by order olf the United States District Court for the District of Missouri Their appointment had been continuedi in Michigan over the lines of the Wabash Railroad Company therein by ancillary pro ceedings taken in the District Court of the United States for tlhe District of Michigan The Wabash Railroad was the owner of certain leased real estate within the City of Detroit The Receivers were anxious to obtain possession of the premises and accordingly instituted summary proceedings for the vacation of the premises by the defendant the summary proceedings being taken under the Michigan statute before a Circuit Court Commissioner an officer of the State Court The plaintiff obtained judgment for restitu tion and the case was appealed through the Circuit Court to the Supreme Court of the State one assignment of error being that the State Court had no jurisdiction of the subjectmatter of the action but that the suit should have been brought in the United States Court upon the grounds stated in defendants brief as follows By taking possession the United States Court acquired exclusive juris diction of the premises and this jurisdiction carried with it the exclusive right to determine all judicial questions relating to the possession of the premises and withdraws the property from the jurisdiction of the state courts so far as the power of the latter to determine questions affecting the rights of parties and privies to the suit in which the receivers were appointed is concerned The defendant then cited the following cases in support of the above statement Farmers Loan  Trust Co v Lake Street Elevated Railroad Company 177 U S 5I Wabash Railroad Company v Adelbert College 208 U S 38 Murphy v John Hofman Company 2II U S 562 Palmer v Texas 212 U S 118 Sullivan v Algrem i6o Fed 366 City of New Orleans v Howard i6O Fed 393 McKayi v Van Kleeck I33 Mich 27 Prather Engi neering Company v Genesee Circuit Judge I49 Mich 53 Premier Steel Company v McElwaineRichards Company I44 Ind 614 On the part of the plaintiff however it was argued that Receivers appointed by the Federal Court had the same right as other citizens to en force their rights and the rights of the corporation of which they are Receivers within the territorial limits of the jurisdiction of the Court from which they derived their appointment or in any court or courts of competent jurisdiction The writer has searched the authorities for a case precisely n point but has met with no success However it is submitted that none Df the cases cited by the defendant supra are authorities for its position I49

Judgment  251Applicability to PleadingsPlaintiffs amended declaration sought to recover for injury to land by an al leged nuisance committed and maintained by defendants prior to the commencement of the action consisting of the pollution of a water course by which plaintiffs lands were subject to a deposit of iron pyrites and sulphurous substances from defendants mines Defend ants plea charged that any nuisance was permanent in character and that all damages therefrom must be recovered in one action and con cluded with an averment that plaintiffs ought not to maintain a claim for temporary damages Another plea raised the same question and concluded that the cause of action pleaded did not accrue within five years before suit The replication to both pleas was general The jury found defendants guilty of the trespass alleged in the declaration and that plaintiffs had been damaged to the extent of 800 Held that such verdict constituted an adverse finding on defendants pleas and that a judgment for plaintiffs on such verdict was not objectionable as in con flict with the declaration and replication Ed NoteFor other cases see Judgment Cent Dig  437 Dec Dig  251 8 VaW Va Enc

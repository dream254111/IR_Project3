SUGGESTIONS ON GEO GRAPHICAL SURVEYING AND PRACTICAL ASTRONOMY SUITED TO PRESENT REQUIREMENTS BY G W LITTLEHALES In the exordium of his address in September I903 before the Southport Meeting of the British Association for the Advance of Science Mr Reeves has pointed out that the era of general geo graphical exploration has practically closed and that the era of mensurational geography has set in throughout nearly the whole world Except in the polar regions there are no longer any vast areas of the earth into which an explorer may penetrate and emerge with the glory of a Livingstone or a Stanley Men capable of giving a good account of what they observe have visited nearly every part of the earths surface and brought back enough to pro vide for the first rude approximation to the mapping of the world The needs of the present time require that travellers who aim to contribute toward an advancement of geographical knowledge should be equipped to record their observations upon a scientific basis In order that conjecture may give place to measurement Mr Reeves rightfully advocates that the explorer should expand over the region to be traversed a system of rapid triangulation starting from a measured baseline connected with some point where latitude and longitude have been fixed by previous opera tions or by his own determination and should delineate the surface forms and other characteristics in relation to the stations of the triangulations by the use of one of the more simple forms of planetable For the construction of the planetable sheets Mr Reeves 101102 Mr E A Reevess Notes and Suggestions on Surveying recommends the Survey of India projection which is based upon the principle of treating a certain limited portion of the sur face of the globe such as a degreequadrangle as if the globular contour had been planed off flat within the chosen limits Tables for facilitating the construction of this projection are to be found in the Auxiliary Tables of the Survey of India but perhaps the American explorer might prefer the polyconic projection which is in use by all the geographical surveys of the United States and with reference to which ready means of construction may be found in the Projection Tables of the United States Hydrographic Office and in many other equally wellknown American works Great as is the importance that the modern geographical explorer should be a draftsman capable of generalizing the physical features of a country so as to represent the leading characteristics with their proper prominence and the details with appropriate subor dination and that he should have a practical knowledge of surveying and astronomy of even greater importance is it that his instrumental equipment should be reliable within the limits imposed by porta bility and ease of manipulation As a result of the authors own experience and investigations while recognizing that there are occasions when the sextant is the only instrument that can be taken for the measurement of angles he assigns to the first place among the explorers mensurational instruments the 6inch transit theo dolite reading with micrometers on both vertical and horizontal cir cles to 5 and by interpolation to 2 or failing this by verniers to Io With such an instrument a close approximation to the lati tude of a station may be obtained from circummeridian altitudes of stars and triangulation may be carried on throughout a large extent of country with such a degree of precision that no appreciable error will result when the work is projected on a scale of B1oV or nearly onefourth of an inch to the mile Mr Reeves has instruc tively described how with such a triangulation executed a small planetable measuring 1 x 2 feet and perhaps smaller fitted with a telescopicalidade by which vertical angles as well as horizontal directions are taken may be employed for the rapid and reliable delineation of large extents of territory in which the surface char acteristics will appear in their proper relative locations and with their forms described in roughly controlled contour lines The assignment of such a piece of work to its exact place on the face of the earth must of course depend upon the determination of the lati tude and longitude of some point within its limits but it is not essential to the usefulness of the survey that this be done at the timeMr E A Reevess Notes and Suggestions on Surveying 103 the survey is made for if it be neglected then obviously the work will remain as a unit to be assigned to its proper geographical place at whatever time in the future a final determination of the geographi cal position may be made The paper under review sets forth the best ordinary methods that would be available to the explorer for finding latitude and lon gitude and does not fail to point out that under the vicissitudes of travel all watches and chronometers that may be transported for time are liable to such uncertainties of rate that all but relative determinations of longitude are extremely unreliable Among the socalled absolute methods that are mentioned as available for determining longitude or Greenwich Mean Time the photographic method devised by Captain E H Hills R E see  Determination of Terrestrial Longitudes by Photography  in the Monthly Notices Royal Astronomical Society London January I893 might have been included because superior results may be attained by its employment in localities isolated from all agencies usually employed in the determination of time NEW MAPS AMERICA NORTH AMERICAKarte von NordAmerika Scale IIooooooo or 1578 statute miles to an inch 33 x 27 in From the SohrBerghaus Handatlas By Dr A Bludau and Otto Herkt Carl Flemming Glogau Presented by Lemcke  Buechner New York City Price 4 marks This may be the first detailed map of North America showing the Republicof Panama In spite of its small scale the map presents effectively an enormous amount of information All that is known of the distribution of gold in Alaska and the Yukon Province of Canada is shown on this map Similar information cannot be found on comparatively largescale maps of Alaska published in the United States within the past few months nor do we often see as in this work the lighthouse system of our Great Lakes depicted on a map embracing the continent We know of no other map of North America which presents so much geographical ethnological and economic information The names of the Indian tribes and other aborigines are printed in red making it easy to find their habitats The oceanographic information as relates to the conformation of the sea floor and to cable lines and ship routes is particularly full The Arctic islands discovered by Sverdrup are shown but Pearys latest work is north

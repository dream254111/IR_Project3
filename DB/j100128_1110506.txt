investing in the rents and profits of the estate the presence of leaseholds is assumed to have been contemplated by the parties to the contract and the covenant against incumbrances is not therefore held infringed15 ENFORCEMENT OF ULTRA VIRES CONTRAOTSCorporations are consid ered creatures of the law having only such rights and powers as the legislature has conferred upon them1 According to the strict theorists acts of a corporation beyond its charter limits are null in the eyes of the law but theoretical concepts of corporations have frequently been forced to yield to practical expediency2 It has been asserted on the other hand that corporations have the power to exceed their charters just as individual persons can exceed their rights3 a con tention that finds no small support in the universal liability of a corporation for its torts4 Yet even under the latter more liberal view acts beyond the authorized limit are contrary to the law and an illegal contract cannot be the basis of an action5 There would seem to be considerable logic with the Supreme Court and the courts of last resort of many of the States of this country in maintaining the strict doctrine of ultra vires that a contract made by a corporation in excess of its granted powers is void6 In opposition to the foregoing decisions however there is a large group typified by the recent case of Seamless Pressed Steel etc Co v Monroe Ind 1914 106 N E 538 which reject the stricter theory to the extent of allowing a party who has performed his share of an ultra vires contract to recover on the contract itself7 It may be well to mxamnine the theory on which this position depends These courts do not classify contracts in excess of chartered powers with those against public policy or in violation of positive statute on which generally and rapidly appreciating there land is capital here it is a commodity there its uses remain largely the same from generation to generation here they are infinitely varied and changeable with every new possessor It is submitted that the nature of leaseholds in our large cities approximates more nearly to conditions in England than to conditions in other parts of the United

only9 were it not for the fact that they treat it as a perfect defense where a contract is wholly executory10 An attempt is sometimes made to justify these decisions on the basis of estoppel1 but one cannot do by estoppel what the law forbids the doing of directly and this explanation is usually rejected2 Even if the difficulty were overcome that all persons dealing with a corporation are bound to ascertain the limits of its corporate power so that the doctrine could be invoked in favor of an individual it would clearly fail to explain those cases where the corporation itself is the plaintiff for the corporation could not be deceived by the statements of another person as to its own powers Attempts to found the doctrine of recovery in these cases on sound theory seem difficult but the true explanation may be found in the feeling of the judges that it would be grossly unjust to allow one who has received the benefit of performance to avail himself of a technical defense to avoid his liability13 Yet it seems no great hardship to deprive a man of his contemplated profits provided he receives just compensation and even those courts which refuse to give any vitality to the contract allow recovery of an equitable nature for property delivered or services renderedl4 It must be admitted however that in exceptional cases recovery on the contract itself seems the only adequate remedy15 and this fact is the strongest support of the contention that public policy justifies a recovery on ultra vires contracts That public policy may modify theories of corporation law is recognized even by the strict federal courts which allow recovery Penn v Bornman I882 102 Ill 523 Franklin Nat Bank v White head I898 I49 Ind 560 Pratt v Short I88o 79 N Y 437 Eastman v Parkinson

and agreed to buy back the stock when the plain tiff should be dismissed The defendant having dismissed the plaintiff refused to perform The court said that the contract was not ultra vires but that if it had been the defense would have been inadmissible since justice could be obtained only by enforcing the contract 268NOTES 269 where the contract is within the general scope of corporate powers with which the other parties seem to be familiar but is beyond the chartered powers in the particular circumstances of its performance of which the other party can know nothing This includes cases where a loan is in excess of the limit of indebtedness10 or the contract is for an unauthorized purpose17 Again public policy requires that a bona fide holder for value of ultra vires commercial paper should be protected18 It is thus seen that public policy even in the strictest jurisdictions seems to take precedence to some extent over metaphysi cal reasons in the formulation of a doctrine of ultra vires But if we accept the premise that corporation restrictions are for the benefit of the public generally19 we may well urge that public policy does not require the enforcement of ultra vires contracts but rather forbids it as tending to encourage the abuse of corporate powers Connecticut etc Bank v Fiske I88o 60 N H 363 Colorado Springs Co v American Pub Co C C A I899 97 Fed 843 sCredit

J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1075782,REFORM OF SECONDARY INSTRUCTION IN PERU,I244603,REFORM OF SECONDARY INSTRUCTION IN PERU R L PACKARD WASHINGTON D C BY A DECREE OF NOVEMBER 25 1905 THE MINISTRY OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION OF PERU DIRECTED CIRCULARS TO BE SENT TO THE VARIOUS COLLEGES OR INSTITUTIONS OF SECONDARY INSTRUCTION AND TO WRITERS UPON EDUCATION THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY REQUESTING CRITICISMS UPON THE EXISTING LAW OF 1902 REGULATING THAT GRADE OF EDUCA TION AND ASKING FOR SUGGESTIONS OF ALTERATIONS WHICH SEEMED TO THEM ADVISABLE TO BE EMBODIED IN A NEW LAW THE RESPONSES TO THESE CIRCULARS WERE PUBLISHED BY THE MINISTER OF PUBLIC INSTRUC TION IN TWO VOLLUMES LIMA 19O6 AND A BRIEF REVIEW OF THEM WILL ILLUSTRATE THE MANNER IN WHICH THE PROPOSED REFORM OF EDUCA TION IS TO BE CARRIED ON IN PERU IN ITS REPORT FOR 1904 THE UNITED STATES BUREAU OF EDUCATION PUBLISHED A SUMMARY OF A REPORT UPON A SIMILAR REFORM MOVEMENT IN PRIMARY EDUCATION IN ARGEN TINE WHICH SHOWED THAT THE AUTHORITIES OF THAT COUNTRY WERE AWAKE TO THE NEED OF A MORE PRACTICAL CHARACTER IN THEIR COMMONSCHOOL CURRICULUM THIS IDEA THAT PUBLIC EDUCATION SHOULD LOOK MORE TOWARD SUPPLYING EFFICIENCY FOR PRACTICAL LIFE APPEARS ABUNDANTLY IN THE DISCUSSIONS IN THE PRESENT VOLUMES FROM PERU LATIN AMERI CANS ARE FULLY AWARE OF WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE WORLD BUT THEY ARE ALSO NATURALLY CONSERVATIVE AND ARE CONSCIOUS THAT THEIR OWN ANTECEDENTS TRADITIONS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF RACE MUST ALL BE CONSIDERED WHEN REFORMS ARE PROPOSED AS THERE IS NO EXPLANATORY INTRODUCTION TO THE VOLUMES BEFORE US CONTAINING THE EXISTING LAW AND THE PROPOLSED CHANGES THE NATURE OF THE CHANGES CAN ONLY BE INFERRED FROM THE INDIVIDUAL REPORTS OR CRITICISMS WE WILL THEREFORE TAKE A FEW OF THE PRINCIPAL POINTS AND OBSERVE THEIR TREATMENT BY THE VARIOUS WRITERS THE OPINION SEEMS PRETTY GENERAL AMONG THE TEACHERS CON SULTED THAT THE FOURYEAR COURSE OF THE LAW OF 19O2 WAS TOO 19OSECONDARY INSTRUCTION IN PERU 191 BRIEF AND TOO CROWDED AND A COURSE OF FIVE AND SOMETIMES OF SIX YEARS IS RECOMMENDED IN THE LATTER CASE WITH A BIFURCATION OF THE COURSE AFTER THE FOURTH YEAR ONE SET OF CLASSES PREPARING FOR THE UNIVERSITY AND THE OTHER FOR PRACTICAL LIFE IN MANY CASES A PREPARATORY COURSE IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED FOR THE FIRST YEAR ON ACCOUNT OF THE UNFITNESS OF THE FIRSTYEAR PUPILS TO TAKE SECOND ARY STUDIES PERHAPS LOCALITY HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE COM PLAINTS ON THIS SCORE WHICH APPEAR IN THE REPORTS FROM THE SECOND ARY SCHOOLS THAT ARE LARGELY ATTENDED BY NATIVES I E THOSE OF NONSPANISH DESCENT IN SOME CASES IT IS RECOMMENDED TO ESTAB LISH SPECIALIZED SECTIONS AS THE LOGICAL END OF SECONDARY INSTRUC TION THE STUDIES IN THESE SECTIONS SHOULD NOT IT IS ARGUED BE PURELY LITERARY OR SCIENTIFIC BUT RELATE TO COMMERCE AND INDUSTRIES MINING AND AGRICULTURE PROFICIENCY IN THESE IT IS URGED IS WHAT IS NEEDED IN PERU AND SOME OF THE WRITERS DEPLORE THE NEGLECT OF SUCH BRANCHES WHILE THE LITERARY OIR PURE SCIENCE STUDIES CONTINUE TO PRODUCE IN THOSE STUDENTS WHO ARE UNABLE TO ATTEND THE UNI VERSITY UNFORTUNATES WHO ARE NOT FULLY PREPARED TO BE EITHER ADVOCATES OR MERCHANTS BUT WHO HAVE LEARNED JUST ENOUGH TO DESPISE LABOR AND WHO DRAG OUT A MISERABLE HANDTOMOUTH EXIST ENCE THIS CLASS IS ALWAYS READY FOR REVOLUTION MANY OF THE REPORTS FROM THE COLLEGES PROPOSE NEW PLANS OF STUDIES IN WHICH THE MODERN SPIRIT IS CONSPICUOUS AN EXTREME EXAMPLE IS AS FOLLOWS FIRST YEARBOTANY ARITHMETIC PRACTICAL AND DEMONSTRATED RELIGION SPANISH GRAMMAR AND COMPOSITION ZO6LOGY PHYSICS GEOGRAPHY PHYSICAL POLITICAL AND COMMERCIAL SECOND YEARSPANISH GRAMMAR AND COMPO SITION ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA GEOGRAPHY OF PERU HISTORY OF PERU PHYSICS ELEMENTARY GEOMETRY ASTRONOMICAL GEOGRAPHY GEOLOGY AND MINERALOGY

MERCHANDISE AND TRADE COMMERCIAL LEGISLATION AGRICULTURAL BOTANY AND ZO6LOGY CHEMISTRY AND MINERALOGY192 THE SCHOOL REVIEW APPLIED TO AGRICULTURE GEOGRAPHY OF THE FAUNA AND FLORA OF PERU METEOR OLOGY SURVEYING MACHINERY HYGIENE LEGISLATION RELATING TO LABOR AGRICUL TURAL INDUSTRIES MINERALOGY AND GEOLOGY OF PERU TRIGONOMETRY SURVEYING ASSAYING DRAWING ELECTROCHEMISTRY AND METALLURGY CHEMISTRY OF METALS MINING MECHANICS AND PHYSICS LEGISLATION AND DRAWING IN THE FOREGOING IT WILL BE SEEN THERE IS NO MENTION OF LATIN OR GREEK OR THE HUMANITIES OR AESTHETICS THIS OMISSION HOW EVER SO FAR FROM MEETING WITH GENERAL APPROVAL ENCOUNTERS STRONG OPPOSITION FROM OTHER TEACHERS NOR DOES IT SEEM QUITE NATURAL IN A COUNTRY WHOSE LANGUAGE IS ITSELF SO NEARLY LATIN TO LEAVE THE SCHOOLS IN IGNORANCE OF THEIR ORIGINAL MOTHERTONGUE ONE TEACHER ARGUES THAT EVEN IF SECONDARY EDUCATION IS ONLY INTENDED TO FORM FUTURE FARMERS ENGINEERS MERCHANTS AND MANUFACTURERS YOUNG MEN WHO ARE TAUGHT THE APPROPRIATE BRANCHES FOR THESE CAREERS ALONE WITHOUT ANY INSTRUCTION IN MORALS OR AESTHETICS WOULD BECOME THE MERE SLAVES OF THEIR DAILY WORK AS TO LATIN ANOTHER TEACHER REMARKS AS FOLLOWS IN THE OPINION OF SOME OUR EDUCATION OUGHT TO HAVE AN IMMEDIATE OBJECT IT SHOULD PROVIDE THAT THE MAJORITY OF PUPILS AFTER FOUR OR FIVE YEARS STUDY SHOULD HAVE A CERTAIN VARNISH OF KNOWLEDGE SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE THEM TO EARN A LIVING THIS IS THE VIEW OF MANY PERSONS WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES PRACTICAL BUT WE MUST NOT ACCEPT THIS VIEW IMAGINE A SOCIETY IN WHICH THOSE WHO ARE REGARDED AS ITS BESTEDUCATED REPRESENTATIVES SHOULD BE IMBUED WITH THE FATAL IDEA THAT THERE IS NOTHING IN LIFE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE PURSUIT OF FACILE AND IMMEDIATE PROFIT SUCH A SOCIETY WOULD SPEEDILY AND NECESSARILY BE CONVERTED INTO AN AGGREGATE OF FEROCIOUS EGOTISTS WITHOUT IDEALS WITHOUT PRINCIPLE WITHOUT VIRTUE YET SUCH A SOCIETY WOULD BE THE RESULT OF A PURELY UTILITARIAN SYSTEM OF PEDAGOGY IT IS THE FUNCTION OF THE HUMANITIES AND ANCIENT LANGUAGES TO GIVE A WIDER SCOPE TO SECONDARY EDUCA TION LATIN SHOULD BE REPLACED IN THE PROGRAMMES IN SOME COUNTRIES THE IMPORTANCE OF LATIN IS DISPUTED STILL LATIN WILL SURVIVE FOR A LONG TIME TO COME THE MODERNS CANNOT FORGET THE DEBT THEY OWE TO ANTIQUITY NOR SHOULD THEY RENOUNCE THE NOBLE PRIVILEGE OF REMAINING IN DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH THE GRAND IDEAS AND HARMONIOUS MODES OF EXPRESSION OF THE ANCIENTS IF A GENERAL CULTURE OF THE MIND RESTS UPON FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES HOW CAN LITERARY CULTURETHE HUMANITIESFULFIL ITS OBJECT IF IT IGNORES THE GREAT EST MANIFESTATIONS OF GENIUS BESIDES IT IS AN ERROR TO BELIEVE THAT ANTIQUITY MERELY REPRESENTS A CLASSICAL TRADITION ANTIQUITY IS STILL A LIVING PHASE IN THE MODERN WORLD IT IS A PART OF THAT MORAL EXISTENCE WHICH HAS PRESERVED ITS UNITY IN THE MIDST OF A CONSTANTLY CHANGING CIVILIZATION SHOULD WE THEN UNDER PRETEXT OF CREATING AN ENTIRELY MODERN EDUCATION SUPPRESS THE ANCIENTSECONDARY INSTRUCTION IN PERU I93 LANGUAGES THAT IS TO SAY SHOULD WE CUT OURSELVES OFF FROM ALL CONTACT WITH THE PAST IF WE SHOULD SUPPRESS THEM OUR STUDENTS WOULD BE LED THROUGH A CYCLE OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE WITHOUT KNOWING ANYTHING OF THE MARVELOUS PRODUCTIONS OF THE ANCIENT MIND THE LEARNING OF LATIN THE SYNTHETIC LANGUAGE OF THE GREAT ROMAN WRITERS DEVELOPS HARMONIOUSLY ALL THE INTELLECTUAL FACULTIES NOTHING EQUALS THE DIGNITY OF LATIN FORMERLY THE SPOKEN LANGUAGE OF THE RULING NATION OF THE OLD WORLD IT HAS LEFT ITS IMPRINT UPON THE LANGUAGES CUSTOMS AND LAWS OF ALL CIVILIZED NATIONS FROM A MORE UTILITARIAN POINT OF VIEW WE SHOULD REMEMBER THAT LATIN IS THE ETY MOLOGICAL SOURCE OF ALL THE NEOLATIN LANGUAGES AND CONSEQUENTLY A COURSE IN LATIN IS A MOST VALUABLE AID TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF SPANISH FURTHERMORE SINCE LATIN LITERATURE IS STUDIED IN THE UNIVERSITY OF LIMA IT IS NECESSARY TO TEACH LATIN IN THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS FOR THOSE WHO INTEND TO TAKE DEGREES IN LAW MEDICINE OR LETTERS AT THE UNIVERSITY HE POINTS OUT FINALLY THAT EVEN IN COUNTRIES WHERE THERE HAS BEEN A DETERMINED EFFORT TO EXCLUDE LATIN FROM THE SCHOOL PROGRAMMES OR AT LEAST LIMIT ITS STUDY TOL A MINIMUM AS IN FRANCE A REACTION IN FAVOR OF RETAINING IT IS NOW SETTING IN ANOTHER WRITER POINTS OUT THAT THERE WOULD BE NO NEED OF WASTING TIME IN LEARNING AN ARITIFICIAL LANGUAGE LIKE VOLAPIIK OR ESPERANTO IF LATIN WERE UNIVERSALLY STUDIED AS FORMERLY THERE IS BY NO MEANS A UNANIMITY OF OPINION ON THIS QUESTION OF LATIN AND IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT THE DECISION OF THE MINISTRY WILL FINALLY BE TAKING UP SOME OF THE REPORTS SERIATIM WE NOTE THE FOLLOWING POINTS IT IS COMPLAINED THAT DEFECTIVE PREPARATION NECESSITATES MUCH REPETITION OF INSTRUCTION IN SOME CASES THE COMPLAINT IS THAT THE TEACHERS THEMSELVES ARE NOT PROPERLY PREPARED WHICH LEADS TO THE RECOMMENDATION OF A NONRMAL SCHOOL THE NEED OF SUCH A SCHOOL AGAIN IS DISPUTED BY OTHERS WHO THINK THAT THE UNI VERSITY AFFORDS ALL THE GENERAL INSTRUCTION NECESSARY FOR TEACHERS AND THAT IF A SPECIAL PRACTICAL COURSE IN PEDAGOGY WERE ADDED IN THE UNIVERSITY WITH ONE YEARS TEACHING IN A COLLEGE BETTER RESULTS WOULD BE REACHED THAN IF A NONRMAL SCHOOL WERE ESTABLISHED THE WRITER REVIEWS THE HISTORY OF NORMAL SCHOOLS IN EUROPE JAPAN AND THE UNITED STATES THE EXAMPLE OF THE ECOLE NORMALE AT PARIS IS CITED TO SHOW THAT A SCHOOL ORIGINALLY INTENDED TO INSTRUCT PROFESSORS OF SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION MAY BECOME AS MUCH OF A UNI VERSITY AND RESEARCH INSTITUTION AS UNIVERSITIES THEMSELVES THE REPORTS ARE FULL AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED OLF SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROV194 THE SCHOOL REVIEW ING THE PROGRAMMES SOME TEACHERS ASKING FOR LONGER COURSES OTHERS REQUESTING CHANGES TO ACCOMMODATE ILLPREPARED PUPILS WITH FREQUENT EXAMINATIONS WHILE SURMENAGE OR OVERWORK OWING TO THE INADEQUACY OF THE FOURYEAR COURSE IS FREQUENTLY DISCUSSED IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT THE STUDENTS THEMSELVES WERE SOME TIMES CONSULTED BY THEIR PROFESSORS IN PREPARING OPINIONS UPON THE PROGRAMMES FOR EXAMPLE A PROFESSOR QUOTES FROM A PERIODICAL PUBLISHED BY THE STUDENTS OF THE COLLEGE OF GUADALUPE A PASSAGE COMPLAINING OF THE CURTAILING OF THE COURSE FROM SIX TO FOUR YEARS WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING REDUCTION IN STUDIES IN A FEW CASES PORTIONS OF THE REPORTS ARE WRITTEN IN DIALECT SO TO SPEAK THAT IS TO SAY IN THE SAME FACILE BUT FALLACIOUS AND CORRUPTING TECHNICAL LANGUAGE WHICH SOME WRITERS ON EDUCATION IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE ADOPTED FROM SOCIOLOGY IT IS NOT GOOD ENG LISH BUT IS A QUASISCIENTIFICPHILOSOPHICALMETAPHYSICALPEDANTIC CANT THE TERMS AND SIMILES OF WHICH ARE TAKEN INDISCRIMINATELY FROM THE MECHANICAL PHYSICAL AND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES WITH MODES OF EXPRESSION TAKEN OVER FROM GERMAN INTO ENGLISH WITHOUT APOLOGY THE DIALECT IS AT ONCE RECOGNIZABLE EVEN WHEN DISGUISED IN SPANISH HERE ARE A FEW SPECIMENS EDUCATION IS GENERALLY SPEAKING THE MOLDING OF THE INDIVIDUAL TO THE COLLECTIVITY  IN THIS EVOLUTIVE PROCESS OF EACH INDIVIDUAL TOWARD THE IDEAL TYPE WHICH SOCIETY OFFERS HIM AS A WHOLE AND OF SOCIETY ITSELF TOWARD THE MOST PERFECT INDIVIDUAL TYPES THERE IS A CONTINUAL MUTUAL EXCHANGE OF DEFECTS AND PERFECTIONS BETWEEN SOCIETY AND THE INDIVIDUAL THE RESULTANT OF WHICH CONSTITUTES CIVILIZATION AND PROGRESS     THE FUNDAMENTAL LAW OF THIS PROCESS IS THE INSTABILITY OF THE HOMOGENEOUS AND THE PRODUCTION OF TENDENCIES FOR THE HETEROGENEOUS  LIBERTY OF ACTION IS REQUIRED BY THE FORCES OF NATURE TO INSURE THEIR MAXIMUM EFFECT THESE FORCES ARE ALWAYS IN PAIRS SO THAT TO EVERY ACTION THERE CORRESPONDS A REACTION WHICH IS PECULIAR TO IT AND THE CONSTANCY OF THIS OPPOSITION IN EACH PAIR MAINTAINS IT IN ITS INDIVIDUALITY WHENCE RESULT THE STABILITY AND HARMONY OF THE WHOLE AND THAT MOBILE EQUILIBRIUM WHICH CONSTITUTES THE ORDER OF THE UNIVERSE HENCE TOO RESULT THE FIXED LAWS WHICH DETER MINE THE STABILITY OF THE SYSTEM SO THAT WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL ENERGY FAILS TO CONFORM THERETO SUCH ENERGY IS SEPARATED FROM ITS OWN PAIR AND INVADES THE FIELD OF ACTION OF ANOTHER ENERGY    CONTRARY TO THE GENERAL ORDER AND CONSEQUENTLY PRODUCING INSTABILITY OR DISORDER EVERY LANGUAGE IS A SOCIOLOGICAL ORGANISM WHICH REPRESENTS A SERIES OF EVOLUTIONS IN HUMAN ACTIVITYSECONDARY INSTRUCTION IN PERU 195 IT APPEARS TOO THAT IN PERU AS IN THE UNITED STATES EVEN WOMEN HAVE BEEN INFECTED WITH THIS PEDANTIC LANGUAGE OF SOCIOLOGY WHICH IS SO FATAL TO TASTE AND DELICACY WHILE MANY OF THE WRITERS OF THESE REPORTS SHOW THAT THEY ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE HISTORY AND PRESENT CONDITION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION IN OTHER COUNTRIES SEVERAL OF THEM GO INTO THE SUBJECT EXHAUSTIVELY AND REVIEW THE DEVELOPMENTS OF THE LAST TWENTYFIVE YEARS IN GERMANY FRANCE BELGIUM ITALY AND THE UNITED STATES QUOTING GOVERNMENT DECREES AND THE WORKS OF THE WELLKNOWN AUTHORS ON THE SUBJECT IN THOSE COUNTRIES TOGETHER WITH PRO GRAMMES OF STUDIES OF THE FRENCH LYCEES THE GERMAN GYMNASIA AND REAL SCHOOLS AND THE HIGH SCHOOLS OF THE UNITED STATES THE PRINCIPAL AUTHORITY QUOTED ON THE UNITED STATES IS COM PAYRES REPORT OF SECONDARY EDUCATION AT THE CHICAGO EXPOSITION IT APPEARS THAT THE EXAMPLE OF FRANCE HAS BEEN FOLLOWED IN PERU MORE THAN THAT OF GERMANY BUT WITH DUE REGARD TO THE SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS OF PERU THE DIFFERENCE CONSISTING PRINCIPALLY IN THE OMISSION OLF LATIN AND GREEK IN THE SPECIAL SECONDARY COURSES IN PERU THE HIGH SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES OF THE UNITED STATES HAVE ALSO SERVED AS TYPES WHICH HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED TO SOME EXTENT IN PERU THE CONTINUOUS PROGRESS FROM THE PREPARATORY SCHOOLS THROUGH THE VARIOUS GRADES INCLUDING THE HIGH SCHOOLS TO THE COLLEGES BEING WELL ESTEEMED THE UNITED STATES SAYS THE WRITER OF THE LONG ARTICLE FROM WHICH WE QUOTE HAS UNDERSTOOD BETTER THAN FRANCE THE OBJECT OF ESTABLISHMENTS OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION MAKING OF THEM PLACES OF TRAINING FOR THE MORE OR LESS ELEVATED PURPOSES OF LIFE SEPARATING GENERAL CULTURE FROM SPECIAL TRAINING AND ESTABLISHING THREE GRADATIONS OF THIS GENERAL CULTURETHE PRIMARY SCHOOL THE HIGH SCHOOL AND THE COLLEGEIN WHICH MAY BE EDUCATED ALL CLASSES OF SOCIETY THOSE OF THE LOWEST OR POOREST CLASS BEING EDUCATED IN THE PRIMARY SCHOOLS WHERE WITH THE INTERMEDIATE GRAMMAR SCHOOL THEY MAY COMPLETE A COURSE WHICH WILL ENABLE THEM TO ENTER BUSINESS WHILE THE CONTINUITY OF THE GRADES IS NOT BROKEN BUT EXTENDS TO THE COLLEGES THIS WRITER INSISTS THAT THE CLASSICAL MODELS ARE NOT SO SUITABLE FOR PERUVIANS TO FOLLOW IN SECONDARY EDUCATION AS THE ANGLOSAXON SPIRIT THE ANCIENT IDEA OF THE UNITY OF THE STATE AND THE SUBJECTION OF THE196 THE SCHOOL REVIEW INDIVIDUAL THERETO SHOULD BE REPLACED BY INDIVIDUAL INITIATIVE AND LIBERTY THE TEUTONIC IDEA ANOTHER WRITER EMPHASIZES THIS VIEW BY DECLARING USING AGAIN THE MODERN QUASISCIENTIFIC DIALECT THAT THE CLASSICAL EDUCATION WHICH WAS PLANTED IN PERU IN COLONIAL TIMES WHICH IS STATIC AND OPPOSED TO THE DYNAMICAL IDEA OF FREE MOVEMENT THE MODERN SPIRIT IS YIELDING TO THE POSITIVIST SYSTEM WHICH THE FATAL LAW OF THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE IMPOSES UPON THE INDIVIDUAL IN MODERN SOCIETY A FEW EXTRACTS FROM AN ADDRESS BY DR PEDRO A LABARTHE PROFESSOR OF PEDAGOGICS IN THE UNIVERSITY AT LIMA WILL ILLUSTRATE THE COMPREHENSIVE VIEW WITH WHICH THE REMODELING OF THE SECOND ARY COURSES IN PERU IS BEING DISCUSSED HE SAYS THE ORIGIN OF BIFURCATION IN SECONDARY EDUCATION IS EASY TO TRACE IT AROSE FROM THE IMPOTENCE OF THE OLD CLASSICAL INSTRUCTION TO PREPARE YOUNG MEN FOR THE SOCALLED SCIENTIFIC CAREERS AND ON THE OTHER HAND FROM THE UTTER IMPOTENCE OF MODERNISM TO GIVE A SUFFICIENT PREPARATION FOR THE LIBERAL PROFESSIONS THE ANTAGONISM BETWEEN CLASSICISM AND UTILITARIANISM PRODUCED BIFURCATION HE THEN REVIEWS BRIEFLY THE HISTORY OF THIS MOVEMENT IN EUROPE THE UNITED STATES AND LATIN AMERICA PERU ADOPTED BIFURCATION IN 1872 BUT RETAINED THAT DIVISION OF COURSES FOR ONLY TEN YEARS THIS SEPARATION OF STUDIES HE SAYS IS NOT A COMPLETE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM INVOLVED BUT ONLY A COMPROMISE FOR A PROOF OF WHICH STATEMENT HE REFERS TO THE EXAMPLE OF GERMANY WHICH HE CALLS THE NORMAL SCHOOL OF THE WORLD AND GERMANY DID NOT ADOPT BIFURCATION BUT ESTABLISHED PARALLEL INSTITUTIONS THE GYMNASIA AND THE REAL SCHOOLS BOTH OF WHICH PREPARE FOR THE UNIVERSITIES HIS ARGUMENT IS AGAINST THE PROPOSED PLAN BIFURCATION LARGELY ON THE GROUND THAT PRECOCIOUS SPECIALIZATION DESTROYS EQUILIBRIUM HE ADDS THESE REMARKABLE WORDS REGARDING THE PERUVIAN RACE WELL ENDOWED AS IT IS WITH INTELLIGENCE AND EASY TO LEAD IT IS STILL UNEDU CATED AND NEEDS AN INTEGRAL EDUCATION AS TO MENTAL QUALITIES THERE ARE TWO TYPES ONE INERT AS THE ANDES THEMSELVES DEVOTED TO TRADITION WITH ASIATIC IMMOBILITY AND EASILY FORMED INTO DOCILE SOLDIERS LABORIOUS FARM HANDS OR GOOD SCHOLARS WHILE THE OTHER TYPE IS FULL OF ENERGY BUT UNSTABLE OF A LIVELY IMAGINATION CHANGEABLE IN ITS FEELINGS IMPELLED BY IMPULSES WHICH ARE OFTEN NOT FULFILLED FULL OF GIGANTIC PROJECTS BUT WITH PIGMEAN REALIZA TION AND BOTH THESE TYPES REQUIRE A UNIFORM EDUCATION TO PRODUCE AN EQUILIB RIUM BETWEEN THEMSECONDARY INSTRUCTION IN PERU 197 HE RETURNS TO THE HISTORY OF MODERN EDUCATION IN FRANCE BEGIN NING WITH THE CIRCULAR OF JULES SIMON IN 1872 WHICH HE SAYS GAVE THE FIRST BLOW TO LATIN AND GREEK IN SECONDARY INSTRUCTION MENTIONS THE CONTINUATION OF THAT MOVEMENT IN 1880 THE REVIVAL OF CLASSICISM IN 1885 THE CREATION OF MODEMRN EDUCATION IN 1890 AND IN A BRIEF PARAGRAPH RECITES THE VICISSITUDES OF THIS BRANCH OF EDUCATION IN FRANCE DOWN TO 1902 INCIDENTALLY HE MENTIONS THAT THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAS OF THE UNITED STATES WERE TAKEN FROM ENGLAND AND GERMANY SOME LATIN REPUBLICS LIKE ARGENTINE AND URUGUAY SOUGHT INSPIRATION FOR THEIR SYSTEMS IN THE UNITED STATES OTHERS LIKE CHILE AND THE CENTRAL AMERICAN REPUBLICS IN GERMANY WHILE PERU HAS ALWAYS FOLLOWED FRANCE HIS OWN PREFERENCE FOR AN EDUCATIONAL MODEL IS GERMANY HOWEVER HE ADDS MODERN DEMOCRACY HAS CREATED ITS OWN SCHOOL WHICH IS DISTINCT FROM THE OLD ARISTOCRATIC SCHOOL AND THE PEOPLE WHOSE EDUCATION HAS BEEN CHIEFLY FORMED BY THE SPIRIT OF A SELECTIVE DEMOCRACY IS THAT OF THE UNITED STATES PERUVIAN REFORMERS MUST THEREFORE STUDY AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL IDEALS AND METHODS THIS COURSE APPEALS TO HIM THE MORE BECAUSE HE ADDS IF THE PERUVIANS ARE AMERICANS AND THEREFORE DEMOCRATIC THEY MUST LOOK TO THAT PEOPLE WHEN THEY CONSIDER THEIR OWN SYSTEM OF PUBLIC EDUCATION ESPECIALLY FOR THE REASON THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THE ENGLISH ORIGIN OF THE UNITED STATES THE METHODS OF INSTRUC TION THERE ARE NOW LARGELY GERMAN ALTOGETHER THERE ARE OVER FIFTY REPORTS IN THESE TWO VOLUMES FROM AS MANY DIFFERENT COLLEGES AND INSTITUTIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY SOME HALFDOZEN OF THEM BY WOMEN SOME OF THE TEACHERS WERE EDUCATED IN GERMANY

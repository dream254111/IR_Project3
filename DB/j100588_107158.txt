TERRESTRIAL OBJECTS WITH AN APPLICATION OF THE RESULT OF THESE EXPERIMENTS TO A SERIES OF OBSERVATIONS ON THE NATURE AND MAGNITUDE OF MR HARDINGS LATELY DISCOVERED STAR BY WILLIAM HERSCHEL LL D F R S READ DECEMBER 6 1804 THE DISCOVERY OF MR HARDING HAVING ADDED A MOVING CELESTIAL BODY TO THE LIST OF THOSE THAT WERE KNOWN BEFORE I WAS DESIROUS OF ASCERTAINING ITS MAGNITUDE AND AS IN THE OB SERVATIONS WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY TO MAKE I INTENDED CHIEFLY TO USE A TENFEET REFLECTOR IT APPEARED TO ME A DESIDERATUM HIGHLY WORTHY OF INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE HOW SMALL A DIA METER OF AN OBJECT MIGHT BE SEEN BY THIS INSTRUMENT WE KNOW THAT A VERY THIN LINE MAY BE PERCEIVED AND THAT OBJECTS MAY BE SEEN WHEN THEY SUBTEND A VERY SMALL ANGLE BUT THE CASE I WANTED TO DETERMINE RELATES TO A VISIBLE DISK A ROUND WELL DEFINED APPEARANCE WHICH WE MAY WITHOUT HESITATION AFFIRM TO BE CIRCULAR IF NOT SPHERICAL IN APRIL OF THE YEAR 1774 I DETERMINED A SIMILAR QUESTION RELATING TO THE NATURAL EYE AND FOUND THAT A SQUARE AREA COULD NOT BE DISTINGUISHED FROM AN EQUAL CIRCULAR ONE TILL THE DIAMETER OF THE LATTER CAME TO SUBTEND AN ANGLE OF 2 17 I DID NOT THINK IT RIGHT TO APPLY THE SAME CONCLUSIONS TO A TELESCOPIC VIEW JDR HIRSCHELS EXPERIMENTS ON THE MEANS OF AN OBJECT AND THEREFORE HAD RECOURSE TO THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTS IST EXPERIMENT WITH THE HEADS OF PINS I SELECTED A SET OF PINS WITH ROUND HEADS AND DEPRIVED THEM OF THEIR POLISH BY TARNISHING THEM IN THE FLAME OF A CANDLE THE DIAMETERS OF THE HEADS WERE MEASURED BY A MICROSCOPIC PRO JECTION WITH A MAGNIFYING POWER OF 8O THESE MEASURES ARE SO EXACT THAT WHEN REPEATED THEY WILL SELDOM DIFER MORE THAN A FEW TEN THOUSANDTHS PARTS OF AN INCH FROM EACH OTHER THEIR SIZES WERE AS FOLLOWS 1375 O083 G 0821 O602 04CP5 I PLACED THE PINS IN A REGULAR ORDER UPON A SMALL POST ERECTED IN MY GARDEN AT 240785 INCHES FROM THE CENTRE OF THE OBJECT MIRROR OF MY TENFEET REFLECTING TELESCOPE THE FOCAL LENGTH OF THE MIRROR ON ARCTURUS IS 1 1964 INCHES BUT ON THESE OBJECTS J 25 9 THE DISTANCE WAS MEASURED WITH DEAL RODS WHEN I LOOKED AT THESE OBJECTS IN THE TELESCOPE I FOUND IMMEDIATELY THAT ONLY THE SMALLEST OF THEM AT THIS DISTANCE COULD BE OF ANY USE FOR WITH AN EYEGLASS OF 4 INCHES WHICH GIVES THE TELESCOPE A MAGNIFYING POWEROF NO MORE THAN 15 THIS PINS HEAD APPEARED TO BE A ROUND BODY AND THE VIEW LEFT NO DOUBT UBPON THE SUBJECT IT SUBTENDED AN ANGLE OF 3G64 AT THE CENTRE OF THE MIRROR AND THE MAGNLLIFIED ANGLE UNDER WHICH I SAW IT WAS 1 546 THIS LOW POWER HOWEVER REQUIRED GREAT ATTENTION WITH A LENS 3 POWER 381I5 I SAW IT INSTANTLY ROUND AND GLOBULAR THE MAGNIFIED ANGLE WAS 2 189 WITH A MAGNIFYING POWER OF 2318  I SAW IT SO PLAINLY THAT  THE POWERS HAVE BEEN STRICTLY ASCERTAINED AS THEY ARE AT THE DISTANCE WHERE HESE OBJECTS WERE VIEWEDOF ASCERTAINING THE MAGNITUDE OF SMALL CELESTIAL BODIES 33 THE LITTLE NOTCH IN THE PINS HEAD BETWEEN THE COILS OF THE WIRE MAKING THE HEAD APPEARED LIKE A NARROW BLACK BELT SUR ROUNDING THE PIN IN THE MANNER OF THE BELTS OF JUPITER THIS NOTCH BY THE MICROSCOPIC PROJECTION MEASURED 00475 INCH AND SUBTENDED AN ANGLE AT THE CENTRE OF THE MIRROR OF O4O07 WITH 3035 I SAW THE BELT STILL BETTER AND COULD FOLLOW IT EASILY IN ITS CONTOUR WITH 4320 I COULD SEE DOWN INTO THE NOTCH AND SAW IT WELL DEFINED WITHIN WITH 523 THE PINS HEAD WAS A VERY STRIKING GLOBULAR OBJECT WHOSE DIAMETER MIGHT EASILY BE DIVIDED BY ESTIMATION INTO TEN PARTS EACH OF WHICH WOULD BE EQUAL TO O364 WITH 9256 I SAW ALL THE SAME PHENOMENA STILL PLAINER THE RESULT OF THIS EXPERIMENT IS THAT AN OBJECT HAVING A DIAMETER O425 MAY BE EASILY SEEN IN MY TELESCOPE TO BE A ROUND BODY WHEN THE MAGNIFIED ANGLE UNDER WHICH IT APPEARS IS 2 189 AND THAT WITH A HIGH POWER A PART OF IT SUBTENDING AN ANGLE OF O364 MAY BE CONVENIENTLY PERCEIVED WHEN I CONSIDERED THE PURPOSE OF THIS EXPERIMENT I FOUND THE RESULT NOT SUFFICIENT TO ANSWER MY INTENTION FOR AS THE SIZE OF THE OBJECT I VIEWED OBLIGED ME TO USE A LOW POWER A DOUBT AROSE WHETHER THE INSTRUMENT WOULD BE EQUALLY DISTINCT WHEN A HIGHER SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO RESOLVE THIS QUESTION IT WAS NECESSARY EITHER TO REMOVE MY OBJECTS TO A GREATER DISTANCE OR TO MAKE THEM SMALLER 2D EXPERIMENT WITH SMALL GLOBULES OF SEALINGWAX I MELTED SOME SEALINGWAX THINLY SPREAD ON A BROAD KNIFE AND DIPT THE POINT OF A FINE NEEDLE A LITTLE HEATED INTO IT WHICH TOOK UP A SMALL GLOBULE WITH SOME PRACTICE I SOON ACQUIRED MDCCCV FDR HERSCHELS EXP NTS ON THE MEANS THE ART OF MAKING THEM PERFECTLY ROUND AND EXTREMELY SMALL TO PREVENT MY SEEING THEM AT A DISTANCE IN A DIFFERENT ASPECT FROM THAT IN VHICH THEY WERE MEASURED UNDER THE MICROSCOPE I FIXED THE NEEDLES WITH SEALINGWAX ON SMALL SLIPS OF CARDS BEFORE THE MEASURES WERE TAKEN EIGHT OF THESE GLOBULES OF THE FOLLOWING DIMENSIONS O466 O325 0290 0O2194 0210 OIG O44 O0763 WERE PLACED UPON THE POST IN MY GARDEN AND I VIEWED THEM IN THE TELESCOPE WITH A POWER OF 2318 I SAW ALL THE FIRST SEVEN NUMBERS WELL DEFINED AND ROUND AND COULD SEE THEIR GRADUAL DECREASE VERY PRECISELY FROM NO 1 TO NO 7 WITH 3035 I SAW THEM BETTER AND HAD A GLIMPSE OF NO 8 BUT COULD NOT BE SURE THAT I SAW IT DISTINCTLY ROUND  THOUGH THE MAGNIFIED ANGLE WAS 3 18L2 WITH 43O0 THEY ARE ALL VERY PALPABLE OBJECTS AND AS A SOLID BODY NO 8 MAY BE SEEN WITHOUT DIFFICULTY AT THE CENTRE OF THE MIRROR IT SUBTENDS AN ANGLE OF O653 WITHL ATTENTION WE MAY ALSO BE SURE OF ITS ROUNDNESS  BUT HERE THE MAGNIFIED ANGLE IS NOT LESS THAN 4 421 WITH 5223 I SEE THEM ALL IN GREAT PERFECTION AS SPHERICAL BODIES AND THE MAGNITUDE OF NO 7 MAY BE ESTIMATED IN QUARTERS OF ITS DIAMETERS THE ANGLE IS 253 AND ONE QUARTER OF IT IS 04313 NO 8 MAY BE DIVIDED INTO TWO HALVES WITH EASE EACH OF WHICH IS O327 WITH 9254 I SAW NO 8 STILL BETTER BUT SEALINGWAX IS NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH FOR SO HIGH A POWER BY THIS EXPERIMENT IT APPEARS THAT WITH A GLOBULE SO SMALL AS O076B3 OF A SUBSTANCE NOT REFLECTING MUCH LIGHT THE MAG NIFIED ANGLE MUST BE BETWEEN 4 AND 5 MINUTES BEFORE WE CAN SEE IT ROWND BUT IT ALSO APPEARS THAT A TELESCOPE WITH A SUFFICIENTOF ASCERTAINING THE MAGIZITZDE OF SMALL CELESTIAL BODIES 5 POWER WILL SHOW THE DISK OF A FAINT OBJECT WHEN THE ANGLE IT SUBTENDS AT THE NAKED EYE IS NO MORE THAN O653G 3D EXP EIMMNT WITH GLOBULESOF SILVER AS THE OBJECTS MADE OF SEALINGWAX ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR COLOUR DID NOT APPEAR TO BE FAIRLY SELECTED FOR THESE INVESTIGA TIONS I MADE A SET OF SILVER ONES THEY WERE FORMED BY RUNNING THE END OF SILVER WIRES THE 3O5TH AND MOTH PART OF AN INCH IN DIAMETER INTO THE FLAME OF A CANDLE IT REQUIRES SOME PRACTICE TO GET THEM GLOBULAR AS THEY ARE VERY APT TO ASSUME THE SHAPE OF A PEAR  BUT THEY ARE SO EASILY MADE THAT WE HAVE ONLY TO REJECT THOSE WHICH DO NOT SUCCEED THIRTEEN OF THEM IN A PRETTY REGULAR SUCCESSION OF MAGNI TUDEWERE SELECTED AND PLACED UPON THE POST THEIR DIMENSIONS WERE 03956 O037I 0329 0317 O272 O0260 OO87 O178 O164 012 01137 OO8OO 0O556 FOR THE SAKE OF MORE CONVENIENCY I HAD REMOVED MY TELE SCOPE FROM ITS STATION IN THE LIBRARY TO A WORKROOM THE DISTANCE OF THE OBJECTS FROM THE MIRROR OF THE TELESCOPE MEA SURED WITH DEAL RODS WAS HERE ONLY G37O5 INCHES AND THE FOCAL LENGTH OF THE MIRROR THE MAGNIFYING POWERS OF THE TELESCOPE AND THE ANGLES SUBTENDED BY THE OBJECTS HAVE BEEN CALCULATED ACCORDINGLY WITH 5227 1 SEE ALL THE GLOBULES FROM NO 1 TO NO 3 PERFECTLY WELL AND CAN ESTIMATE THE LATTER IN QUARTERS OF ITS DIAMETER THE ANGLE IT SUBTENDS AT THE CENTRE OF THE MIRROR IS 0484 AND ONE QUARTER OF IT IS O 121 WITH THE SAME POWER I SEE THE WIRES WHICH HOLD THE BALLS SO WELL THAT EVEN THE SMALLEST OF THEM MAY BE DIVIDED INTO F 2356 DR HERSCHELS EXPERIMENTS ON THE MEANS HALF ITS THICKNESS IT MEASURES 00237 THE ANGLE IS O2O5 AND HALF OF IT O1H 3O WITH 4330 I SEE ALL THE GLOBULES OF A ROUND FORM AND CAN BY ESTIMATION DIVIDE NO I3 INTO TWO HALVES THE MAGNIFIED ANGLE IS HERE G 29O BUT AS ITS DIAMETER COULD BY ESTIMATION HE DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS THE ROUND FORM OF A GLOBULE SOME WHAT LESS MIGHT PROBABLY HAVE BEEN PERCEIVED SO THAT THE MAGNIFIED ANGLE WOULD PERHAPS NOT HAVE MUCH EXCEEDED THE QUANTITY 2 I 89 THAT HAS BEEN ASSIGNED BEFORE AFTER SOME TIME THE WEATHER BECAME MUCH OVERCAST AND AS THE GLOBULES WERE PLACED OVER A CUT HEDGE THE LEAVES AND INTERSTICES OF WHICH DID NOT REFLECT MUCH LIGHT THEY RECEIVED THE GREATEST PART OF THEIR ILLUMINATION FROM ABOVE THIS MADE THEM GRADUALLY ASSUME THE SHAPE OF HALF MOONS PLACED HORI ZONTALLY THE DARK PART OF THESE LITTLE LUNES HOWEVER DID NOT APPEAR SENSIBLY LESS THAN THE ENLIGHTENED PART SO THAT THERE COULD NOT BE ANV THING SPURIOUS ABOUT THEM BY THIS EXPERIMENT WE FIND THAT THE TELESCOPE ACTS VERY WELL WITH A HIGH POWER AND WILL SHOW AN OBJECT SUBTENDING ONLY O484I SO LARGE THAT WE MAY DIVIDE IT INTO QUARTERS OF ITS DIAMETER 4TH EXPERIMENT WITH GLOBULES OF PITCH BEESWAX AND BRIMSTONE I HAD BEFORE OBJECTED TO SEALINGWAX GLOBULES ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR DINGYRED COLOUR IN THE LAST EXPERIMENT A DOUBT WAS RAISED WITH REGARD TO THE SILVER ONES BECAUSE THEY WERE PER HAPS TOO GLOSSY IN ORDER TO COMPARE THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES TOGETHER IN THE SAME ATMOSPHERE I PUT UP THREEOF ASCERTAINING THE MAGNITUDE OF SMALL CELESTIAL BODIES 57 GLOBULES NO I OF SILVER DIAMETER OI137 NO 2 OF SEALING WAX O 125 NTO 3 OF PITCH OO653 WITH 5227 I SAW NO I ROUND AND COULD ESTIMATE L OF ITS DIAMETER THE ANGLE IS O989 4 OF IT IS O247 I SAW NO 2 ROUND BUT OF A DUSKYRED COLOUR IT IS NOT NEARLY SO BRIGHT AS NO I NOR DOES IT APPEAR QUITE SO LARGE AS THE PROPORTIONAL MEASURE OF THE GLOBULES WOULD REQUIRE I CAN ESTIMATE 3 OF ITS DIAMETER THE ANGLE IS O979 AND I OF IT IS O326 NO 3 REFLECTS SO LITTLE LIGHT THAT I CAN BARELY PERCEIVE THE GLOBULE BUT NOT ITS FORM AND YET IT SUBTENDS AN ANGLE OF O568 TO DISCOVER WHETHER THIS OUGHT TO BE ASCRIBED INTIRELY TO THE WANT OF REFLECTION OF THE PITCH I TOOK UP SOME WHITE MELTED BEESWAX BY DIPPING THE FINE POINT OF A NEEDLE PERPENDICU LARLY INTO IT THIS HAPPENED TO BE ONLY HALF A GLOBULE AND ITS DIAMETER WAS O0O  WHEN I EXAMINED THE OBJECT WITH 523 I SAW IT WITH GREAT EASE AND COULD ESTIMATE  OF ITS DIAMETER THE ANGLE IS O914 AND 4 OF IT IS O228 1 SAW ALSO THAT IT WAS BUT HALF A GLOBULE I TOOK UP ANOTHER THAT I MIGHT HAVE A ROUND ONE BUT FOUND THAT AGAIN I HAD ONLY HALF A GLOBULE IT WAS SO PERFECTLY BI SECTED THAT ART AND CARE UNITED COULD NOT HAVE DONE IT BETTER ITS DIAMETER WAS OI O8 IN THE TELESCOPE I SAW ITS SEMIGLOBULAR FORM AND COULD ESTIMATE 4 OF ITS DIAMETER BY SOME FURTHER TRIALS IT APPEARED THAT A PERFECT GLOBULE OF THIS SUBSTANCE COULD NOT BE TAKEN UP THE REASON OF WHICH IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO PERCEIVE FOR AS IT MELTS WITH VERY LITTLE HEAT IT WILL COOL THE MOMENT THE NEEDLE IS LIFTED UP  AND THE SURFACE WHICH COOLS FIRST WILL BE FLAT38 DR HERSCHELS EXPERIMENTS ON THE MEANS THE ROUNDNESS OF THE OBJECTS BEING A MATERIAL CIRCUMSTANCE I MELTED A SMALL QUANTITY OF THE POWDER OF BRIMSTONE AND DIPPING THE POINT OF A NEEDLE INTO IT I FOUND THAT GLOBULES PERFECTLY SPHERICAL AND EXTREMELY SMALL MIGHT BE TAKEN UP 1 HAD ONE OF THEM THAT DID NOT EXCEED THE 64OTH PART OF AN INCH IN DIAMETER WHEN FOUR OF THE FOLLOWING SIZES OO962 009125 00475 O002375 WERE PLACED ON THE POST IN THE GARDEN AND VIEWED FROM THE WORKROOM STATION WITH 5227 1 SAW NO 1 2 AND ROUND BUT N 4O WAS INVISIBLE THESE GLOBULES REFLECT BUT LITTLE LIGHT SO THAT THEY ARE NOT EASILY TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE SURROUNDING ILLUMINATION OF THE ATMOSPHERE BUT WHEN I PLACED SOME DARK BLUE PAPER A FEW INCHES BEHIND THEM I THEN COULD ALSO PERCEIVE NO 4 AS A ROUND BODY THE ANGLE IT SUBTENDS IS OEO7 5TH EXPERIMENT WITH OBJECTS AT A GREATER DISTANCE HAVING CARRIED THE MINUTENESS OF THE GLOBULES AS FAR AS APPEARED TO BE PROPER I CONSIDERED THAT A VALUABLE ADVANTAGE WOULD BE GAINED BY INCREASING THE DISTANCE OF THE OBJECTS THE EXPERIMENTS MIGHT HERE BE MADE UPON A LARGER SCALE AND THE BODY OF AIR THROUGH WHICH IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO VIEW THE GLOBULES WOULD BRING THE ACTION OF THE TELESCOPE MORE UPON A PAR WITH AN APPLICATION OF IT TO CELESTIAL OBJECTS ON A TREE AT 96204 INCHES FROM THE OBJECT MIRROR OF THE TE LESCOPE I FIXED THE SEALINGWAX GLOBULES OF THE 2D EXPERIMENT THE DISTANCE WAS MEASURED BY A CHAIN COMPARED WITH DEAL RODS AND BY CALCULATION THE ALTITUDE OF THE OBJECTS HAS BEEN PROPERLY TAKEN INTO THE ACCOUNT WITH 5026 NO 1 IS A VERY LARGE OBJECT SO THAT WERE I TOOF ASCERTAI NG THE MAGNITUDE OF SMNIV CELESTIAL BODIES SEE A CELESTIAL BODY UNDER THE SAME ANGLE I COULD NEVER MISS TAKE IT FOR A SMALL STAR TIHE ANGLE IT SUBTENDS IS O 999 I SEE THE DIAMETERS OF NO  AND 3 VERY CLEARLY AND CAN DIVIDE THEM BY ESTIMATION INTO TWO PARTS HALF OF NO 3 IS OIT I SEE NO 4 AND 5 AS ROUND BODIES BUT CANNOT DIVIDE THEM BY ESTIMATION THE DIAMETER OF NO IS OM NO 6 MAY ALSO BE N BUT 7 AND 8 ARE IINVISIBLE THESE OBJECTS REFLECTING TOO LITTLE LIGHT THE SILVEI GLOBULES OF THE 8D EXPERIMENT WERE PLACED ON THE TREE IT WILL BE RIGHT TO MENTION THAT THEY WERE ALL SO FAR TARNISHED BY HAVING BEEN OUT IN THE OPEN AIR FOR MORE THAN A FORTNIGHT THAT NO IMPROPER REFLECTION WAS TO BE APPREHENDED THE AIR BEING UNCOMMONLY CLEAR I SAW WITH OS6 THE GLO BULES NO I X 3 4 BY AND 6 AS WELL DEFINED BLACK BALLS I COULD EASILY DISTINGUISH 4 OF THE DIAMETER OF NO 6 WHICH IS O1139 WITH 4T57 I SAW THEM ALL ROUND AS FAR AS NO TO INCLUDED WITH 5026 I SAW NO 9 AND IO VERY SHARP AND BLACK AND COULD DIVIDE NO TO INTO TWO PARTS EACH OF WHICH WOULD BE WITH A NEW LENS POWER 7597 I SAW NO LO BETTER THAN WITH 5026 AND COULD WITH EASE DISTINGUISH IT INTO HALVES OR EVEN THIRD PARTS OF ITS DIAMETER J OF IT IS OO89 WITH 223I I SAW THEM ALL AS FAR AS NO TO INCLUDED AS VISIBLE OBJECTS BUT THE SMALLEST OF THEM WERE MERE POINTS NO 6 MIGHT BE DIVIDED WITH THIS POWER INTO TWO PARTS EACH BEING O279 WITH 9921 I SAW NO TO SHARP AND ROUND THE MAGNIFIED ANGLE IS ONLY A T83 ONE HALF OF NO 6 MAY BE PERCEIVED WVITH GREAT EASE40 DR HERSCHELS EXPERIMENTS ON THE MEANS THE WEATHER BEING AS FAVOURABLE AS POSSIBLE I SAW WITH 4157 THE GLOBULE NO LO ROUND AT FIRST SIGHT THE MAGNIFIED ANGLE IS A SLL2 I CAN SEE NO 12 STEADILY ROUND  THE ANGLE IS OIL4 72 IT IS HOWEVER A MERE POINT AND DIVISIONS OF IT CANNOT BE MADE WITH A NEW IOFEET REFLECTOR POWER 540 THE GLOBULE NO 1O IS BEAUTIFULLY WELL DEFINED AND L OF IT MAY BE ESTIMATED THE ANGLE IS O268 V OF IT IS O134 WITH THE OLD REFLECTOR AND 5026 I SEE NO 12 STEADILY ROUND NO 7 II AND 13 HAVE MET WITH AN ACCIDENT AND COULD NOT BE OBSERVED 6TH EXPERIMENT ZWITH ILLUMIINATED GLOBULES THE NIGHT BEING VERY DARK 8 SILVER GLOBULES FROM O291 TO 0O596 IN DIAMETER WERE PLACED ON THE POST AND ILLUMINATED BY A LANTERN HELD UP AGAINST THEM WITH 5227 1 SAW THEM ALL PERFECTLY WELL BUT THE SMALL QUANTITY OF LIGHT THROWN ON THEM WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO MAKE ANGULAR EXPERIMENTS UPON THEM AS OBJECTS I SAW THEM AS EASILY AS IN THE DAY TIME PROBABLY THE PHASES OF THE ILLUMI NATED DISKS I SAW MIGHT BE SUCH AS THE MOON WOULD SHOW WHEN ABOUT 9 OR LO DAYS OLD THE ANGLE OF NO 8 HAD IT BEEN FULL WOULD HAVE BEEN O519 A BETTER WAY OF ILLUMINATION MIGHT BE CONTRIVED SPURIOUS DIAMETERS OF CELESTIAL OBJECTS OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS WITH REMARKS JULY 17 1779 WITH A 7FEET REFLECTOR POWER 280 I SAW THE BODY OF ARCTURUS VERY ROUND AND WELL DEFINED I SAWOF ASCERTAINING THE MAGNITUDE OF SMALL CELESTIAL BODIES 41 ALSO  URSCE MAJORIS AND OTHER STARS EQUALLY ROUND AND  AS WELL DEFINED REMARKS   AS THESE DIAMETERS ARE UNDOUBTEDLY SPURIOUS IT FOLLOWS THAT WITH THE STARS THE SPURIOUS DIAMETERS ARE LARGER THAN THE REAL ONES WHICH ARE TOO SMALL TO BE SEEN SEPT 9 1779 THE TWO STARS OF  BOOTIS ARE OF UNEQUAL DIA METERS ONE OF THEM BEINGS ABOUT THREE TIMES AS LARGE AS THE OTHER 2 FROM THIS AND MANY ESTIMATIONS OF THE SPURIOUS DIA METERS OF THE STARS IT FOLLOWS NOT ONLY THAT THWEY ARE OF DIFFERENT SIZES BUT ALSO THAT UNDER THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES THEIR DIMENSIONS ARE OF A PERMANENT NATURE AUGUST 25 I78O THE LARGE STAR OF Y ANDROMEDA IS OF A VERY FINE REDDISH COLOUR AND THE SMALL ONE BLUE 3 BY THIS AND MANY OTHER OBSERVATIONS IT APPEARS THAT THE SPURIOUS DIAMETERS OF THE STARS ARE DIFFERENTLY COLOURED AND THAT THESE COLOURS ARE PERMANENT WHEN CIRCUMSTANCES ARE THE SAME NOV 23 1 779 1 VIEWED A GEMINORUM WITH A POWER OF 449 AND SAW THE TWO STARS IN THE UTMOST PERFECTION THE VACANCY BETWEEN THEM WAS ABOUT 1I DIAMETER OF THE LARGEST I FOUND WHEN I LOOKED WITH A LOWER POWER THAT THE PROPORTION BETWEEN THE DISTANCE AND MAGNITUDE OF THE STARS UNDERWENT AN ALTERATION WITH 22 THE VACANCY WAS I DIAMETER AND WITH I 1 IT WAS NO MORE THAN I DIAMETER OF THE SMALLEST OF THE TWO STARS OR LESS 4  BY MANY OBSERVATIONS A NUMBER OF INSTANCES OF WHICH  SEE CATALOGUES OF DOUBLE STARS PHIL TRANS FOR 1782 P 1I 5 AND FOR 1785 PAGE 40 MDCCCV 042 DR HERSCHELS EXPERIMENTS ON THE MEANS MAY BE SEEN IN MY CATALOGUES OF DOUBLE STARS THEIR SPURIOUS DIAMETERS ARE LESSENED BY INCREASING THE MAGNIFYING POWER AND INCREASE WHEN THE POWER IS LOWERED S IT IS ALSO PROVED BY THE SAME OBSERVATIONS THAT THE INCREASE AND DECREASE OF THE SPURIOUS DIAMETERS IS NOT INVERSELY AS THE INCREASE AND DECREASE OF THE MAGNIFYING POWER BUT IN A MUCH LESS RATIO NOV 13 1782 THE TWO STARS OF THE DOUBLE STAR 40 LYNCIS WITH A POWER OF 46O ARE VERY UNEQUAL AND WITH 227 THEY ARE EXTREMELY UNEQUAL 6 FROM THIS WE FIND THAT THE MAGNIFYING POWER ACTS UNEQUALLY ON SPURIOUS DIAMETERS OF DIFFERENT MAGNITUDES LESS ON THE LARGE DIAMETERS AND MORE ON THE SMALL ONES AUG 20 I781 I SAW  BOOTIS WITH 460 AND THE VACANCY BETWEEN THE TWO STARS WAS 1 DIAMETER OF THE LARGE ONE I THEN REDUCED THE APERTURE OF THE TELESCOPE BY A CIRCLE OF PASTE BOARD FROM 63 INCHES TO 3 AND THE VACANCY BETWEEN THE TWO STARS BECAME ONLY 2 DIAMETER OF THE SMALL STAR THE PROPORTION OF THE DIAMETERS OF THE TWO STARS TO EACH OTHER WAS ALSO CHANGED CONSIDERABLY FOR THE SMALL ONE WAS NOW AT LEAST 3 IF NOT 3 OF THE LARGE ONE  7 THIS SHOWS THAT WHEN THE APERTURE OF THE  TELESCOPE IS LESSENED IT WILL OCCASION AN INCREASE OF THE SPURIOUS DIAMETERS AND WHEN INCREASED WILL REDUCE THEM 8 IT ALSO SHOWS THAT THE INCREASE AND DECREASE OF THE UNEQUAL SPURIOUS DIAMETERS BY AN ALTERATION OF THE APERTURE OF THE TELESCOPE IS NOT PROPORTIONAL TO THE DIAMETERS OF THE STARS 9 BUT THAT THIS ALTERATION ACTS MORE UPON SMALL SPURIOUS DIAMETERS AND LESS UPON LARGE ONES AUG 7 1783 1 TRIED SOME EXCESSIVELY SMALL STARS NEAR YOF ASCERTAINING THE MAGNITUDE OF SMALL CELESTIAL BODIES 43 AQUILAE WHEN V WAS PERFECTLY DISTINCT AND ROUND THE ER TREMELY SMALL STARS WERE DUSKY AND ILL DEFINED THE EXCESSIZOELY SMALL ONES WERE STILL LESS DEFINED AS THERE ARE STARS OF ALL SIZES IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD I SAW SOME SO VERY MINUTE THAT THEY ONLY HAD THE APPEARANCE OF A SMALL DUSKY SPOT APPROACHING TO MERE NEBULOSITY BY VERY LONG ATTENTION I PERCEIVED MANY SMALL DUSKY NEBULOUS SPOTS WHICH HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THIS ATTENTION MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE FIELD OF VIEW WITHOUT THE LEAST SUSPICION  O FROM THIS WE FIND THAT STARS WHEN THEY ARE EXTREMELY SMALL LOSE THEIR SPURIOUS DIAMETERS AND BECOME NEBULOUS JULLY 71780 I SAW THE SPURIOUS DIAMETER OF ARCTURUS GRA DUALLY DIMINISHED BY A HAZINESS OF THE ATMOSPHERE TILL IT VANISHED INTIRELY A MORE CIRCUMSTANTIAL ACCOUNT OF THIS OBSERVATION HAS ALREADY BEEN GIVEN AND SOME OTHER CAUSES THAT AFECT THE SPURIOUS DIAMETER OF THE STARS HAVE BEEN POINTED OUT IN THE SAME PAPER SUCH AS TREMULOUS AIR WIND AND HOARFROST JANUARY 3S 178GR THE STAR IN THE BACK OF COLUMBA MAKES A SPECTRUM ABOUT A OR 6 LONG AND ABOUT 2 BROAD FINELY COLOURED BY THE PRISMATIC POWER OF THE ATMOSPHERE AT THIS ALTITUDE JULY S8 1783 FOMALHAUT GIVES A BEAUTIFUL PRISMATIC SPEC TRUM ON ACCOUNT OF ITS LOW SITUATION JULY 17 1781 WITH A NEW LENS POWER BETWEEN 5 AND 6R HUNDRED I SAW  AQUARII AND FOUND THE VACANCY BETWEEN THE TWO STARS EXACTLY 2 DIAMETERS WITH MY OLD ONE POWER ONLY 460 IT WAS FULL 2 DIAMETERS AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN LARGER WITH THE HIGH POWER THAN WITH THE LOW ONE IT SHOWS THAT THE BEST EYELENS WILL GIVE THE LEAST SPURIOUS DIAMETER 0 SEE PHIL TRANS FOR 3803 PAGE 2Z4  Z44 DR HERSCHIELS EXPERIMENTS ON THE MEANS OCT 12 1782 I TRIED A NEW PLAIN SPECULUM MADE BY A VERY GOOD WORKMAN AND FOUND THAT WHEN I VIEWED A GEMINORUM WITH 460 THE VACANCY BETWEEN THE TWO STARS WAS BARELY IJ DIAMETER BUT THE SAME TELESCOPE AND POWER WITH MY OWN SMALL SPECULUM MADE THE DISTANCE 92 DIAMETERS SO THAT THE FIGURE OF THIS MIRROR AFFECTS THE SPURIOUS DIAMETERS OF THE STARS 1 I  HENCE WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT MANY CAUSES WILL HAVE AN INFLUENCE ON THE APPARENT DIAMETER OF THE SPURIOUS DISKS OF THE STARS  BUT THEY ARE SO FAR WITHIN THE REACH OF OUR KNOW LEDGE THAT WITH A PROPER REGARD TO THEM THE CONCLUSION WE HAVE DRAWN IN REM 2  THAT UNDER THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES THEIR DIMENSIONS ARE PERMANENT WILL STILL REMAIN GOOD SPURIOUS DIAMETERS OF TERRESTRIAL OBJECTS WITH SIMILAR REMARKS 7TH EXPERIMENT WITH SILVER GLOBULES A NUMBER OF SILVER GLOBULES WERE PUT ON THE POST BEFORE THEY HAD BEEN TARNISHED AND THE SUN SHONE UPON THEM WHEN I VIEWED THEM IN THE TELESCOPE THERE WAS ON EACH OF THEM A LUCID APPEARANCE RESEMBLING THE SPURIOUS DISK OF A STAR I COULD DISTINGUISH THIS BRIGHT SPOT FROM THE REAL DIAMETERS OF THE GLOBULES PERFECTLY WELL AND FOUND IT MUCH LESS THAN THEY WERE REM  1 HENCE WE CONCLUDE THAT THE TERRESTRIAL SPURIOUS DISKS OF GLOHULES ARE LESS THAN THE REAL DISKS WHEREAS WE HAVE SEEN IN REMARK I OF THE CELESTIAL SPURIOUS DISKS THAT THESE ARE LARGER THAN THE REAL ONESOF ASCERTAINING THE MAGNITUDE OF SMALL CELESTIAL BODIES 45 8TH EXPERIMENT THE LUMINOUS SPOTS OR SPURIOUS DISKS OF THE GLOBULES WERE OF UNEQUAL DIAMETERS THE GLOBULE NO L HAD THE LARGEST DISK AND THE SMALLER ONES THE LEAST AND THE GRADATION OF THE SIZES FOLLOWED THE ORDER OF THE NUMBERS 2  THIS AGREES WITH THE SPURIOUS DISKS OF CELESTIAL OBJECTS THE STARS OF THE FIRST SECOND AND THIRD MAGNITUDE HAVING A LARGER SPURIOUS DISK THAN THOSE THAT ARE OF INFERIOR MAGNITUDES 9TH EXPERIMENT I FOUND THAT THERE WAS A CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCE IN THE COLOUR OF THE SPURIOUS DISKS ONE OF THEM WAS OF A BEAUTIFUL PURPLE COLOUR ANOTHER WAS INCLINED TO ORANGE A LARGE ONE WAS STRAW COLOURED A SMALL ONE PALEASH COLOURED AND MOST OF THEM WERE BLUISHWHITE   WITH RESPECT TO COLOURS THEREFORE THE TERRESTRIAL ALSO AGREE WITH THE CELESTIAL SPURIOUS DISKS MOTH EXPERIMENT I MADE TWO GLOBULES OF DIFFERENT DIAMETERS AND PLACED THEM VERY NEAR EACH OTHER SO THAT THEIR SPURIOUS DISKS MIGHT RE SEMBLE THOSE OF A DOUBLE STAR THIS SUCCEEDED PERFECTLY WELL I VIEWED THEM WITH DIFFERENT POWERS WITH 177 THE VACANCY BETWEEN THEM IS X DIAMETER OF THE LARGE STAR WITH 232 IT IS I DIAMETER WITH 3O38 IT IS I8 DIAMETER WITH 4323 IT IS I4 I THIS EXPERIMENT PROVES THAT THE SPURIOUS DIAMNETERS46  DR HERSCHELS EXPENMENTS ON THE MEANS OF THE GLOBULES ARE ALSO IN THIS RESPECT LIKE THE SPURIOUS DISKS OF THE STARS FOR THEY ARE PROPORTIONALLY LESSENED BY INCREASING THE MAGNIFYING POWER AND INCREASED WHEN THE POWER IS LOWERED S5 WHEN THE ESTIMATIONS ARE COMPARED WITH THE POWERS IT WVILL ALSO BE SEEN THAT THE INCREASE AND DECREASE OF THE SPURIOUS DISKS OFTHE GLOBULES IS NOT INVERSELY AS THE POWERS BUT IN A MUCH LESS RATIO IITH EXPERIMENT TWO OTHER GLOBULES OF DIFFERENT SIZES WERE EXAMINED AND WITH 7063 THEY WERE PRETTY UNEQUAL WITH 52G7 THEY WERE CONSIDERABLY UNEQUAL WITH 3O38 THEY WERE VERY UNEQUAL 6 THIS PROVES THAT THE EFFECT OF MAGNIFYING POWER IS UNEQUALLY EXERTED ON SPURIOUS DIAMETERS AND THAT AS WITH CELESTIAL OBJECTS SO WITH TERRESTRIAL THIS POWER ACTS MORE ON THE SMALL SPURIOUS DISKS THAN ON THE LARGE ONES 12TH EXPERIMENT I VIEWED A DIFFERENT ARTIFICIAL DOUBLE STAR WITH 527 AND KEEPING ALWAYS THE SAME POWER CHANGED THE APERTURE OF THE TELESCOPE WITH THE INSIDE RAYS I FOUND THEM CONSIDERABLY UNEQUTAL AND 21 DIAMETERS OF THE LARGEST ASUNDER THE SPURIOUS DISKS ARE PERFECTLY WELL DEFINED ROUND AND OF A PLANETARY ASPECT WITH ALL THE MIRROR OPEN THEY ARE ALSO ROUND AND WELL DEFINED WITH THE OUTSIDE RAYS THEY ARE NEAR4 DIAMETERS OF THE LARGEST ASUNDER AND ARE ALSO ROUND AND DISTINCT BUT SURROUNDED WITH JIASHING RAYS AND BRIGHT NODULES IN CONTINUAL MOTIONOF ASCERTAINING THE MAGNITUDE OF SMALL CELESTIAL BODIES 47 7  THIS SHOWS THAT THE SPURIOUS TERRESTRIAL DISKS IN THIS RESPECT AGAIN RESEMBLE THOSE OF THE STARS INCREASING WHEN THE APERTURE IS LESSENED AND DECREASING WHEN IT IS ENLARGED I3TH EXPERIMENT WITH THE SAME MAGNIFYING POWER 4323 BUT A CHANGE OF APERTURE I VIEWED TWO EQUAL GLOBULES AND TWO UNEQUAL ONES WITH THE INSIDE RAYS THE EQUAL GLOBULES WERE I DIAMETER ASUNDER WITH ALL THE MIRROR OPEN THEY WERE 12 DIAMETER ASUNDER AND WITH THE OUTSIDE RAYS THEY WERE 2 DIAMETERS ASUNDER THE UNEQUAL GLOBULES WITH THE INSIDE RAYS WERE A LITTLE UNEQUAL AND I DIAMETER OF THE LARGE ONE ASUNDER WITH THE OUTSIDE RAYS THEY WERE CONSIDERABLY UNEQUAL AND 2 DIAMETERS OF THE LARGE ONE ASUNDER 8 BY THESE EXPERIMENTS IT IS PROVED THAT THE INCREASE AND DECREASE OF THE DIAMETERS OCCASIONED BY DIFFERENT APERTURES IS NOT PROPORTIONAL TO THE DIAMETERS OF THE SPURIOUS DISKS 9 BUT THAT THE CHANGE OF THE APERTURES ACTS MORE ON THE SMALL AND LESS ON THE LARGE ONES 14TH EXPERIMENT NO I OF A SET OF GLOBULES HAS THE LARGEST SPURIOUS DIAMETER NO 3 IS LARGER THAN NO 2  WHEREAS NO 2 HAS THE LARGEST REAL DIAMETER IT IS INCLINED TO A GREENISH COLOUR NO 3 IS KNOW REDDISH AND IS LARGER THAN NO I WHICH IS AT PRESENT LESS THAN NO  NO I GROWSBIGGER AND IS NOW THE LARGEST THE SUN WHICH HAD BEEN SHINING WAS OBSCURED BY SOME CLOUDS BUT THE SPURIOUS DIAMETERS OF THE GLOBULES I WAS VIEWIN48 DR RHERSCHELS EXPERIMENTS ON THE MEANS REMAINED VISIBLE AND WERE ALMOST AS BRIGHT AS WHEN THE SUN SHONE UPON THEM I SAW ONE OF  GLOBULES LOSE ITS SPURIOUS DIAMETER WHILE THE SUN CONTINUED TO SHINE AFTER SOME TIME THE SPURIOUS DIA METER CAME ON AGAIN AND VERY GRADUALLY GRE BRIGHTER BUT NOT LARGER THE COLOUR OF ONE OF THE GLOBULES BEING OF A BEAUTIFUL PURPLE CHANGED SOON AFTER TO A BRILLIANT WHITE THE SUN BEING OBSCURED BY SOME CLOUDS A GLOBULE LOST ITS SPURIOUS DIAMETER AND ACQUIRED THE SHAPE OF AN HALF MOON OF THE SIZE OF THE REAL DISK OR DIAMETER OF THE GLOBULE I SAW THE SUN BREAK OUT AGAIN AND THE HALF MOON WAS GRADUALLY TRANS FORMED INTO A MUCH SMALLER SPURIOUS DISK IC THE SPURIOUS DISKS OF GLOBULES ARE LOST FOR WANT OF PROPER ILLUMINATION BUT DO NOT CHANGE THEIR MAGNITUDE ON THAT ACCOUNT THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE ATMOSPHERE IN A FINE DAY IS SUFFICIENT TO PRODUCE THEM  THOUGH THE ILLUMINATION OF THE SUN IS GENERALLY THE PRINCIPAL CAUSE OF THEM II THE DIAMETERS OF SPURIOUS DISKS ARE LIABLE TO CHANGE FROM VARIOUS CAUSES AN ALTERATION IN THE DIRECTION OF THE ILLU MINATION WILL MAKE THE REFLECTION COME FROM A DIFFERENT PART OF THE GLOBULE WHICH CAN HARDLY BE EXPECTED TO BE EQUALLY PO LISHED IN ITS SURFACE OR OF EQUAL CONVEXITY EVERY WHERE BEING VERY SELDOM PERFECTLY SPHERICAL BUT AS UPON THE WHOLE THE FIGURE OF THEM IS PRETTY REGULAR THE APPARENT DIAMETER OF THE SPURIOUS DISKS WILL GENERALLY RETURN TO ITS FORMER SIZES L5TH EXPERIMENT WITH DROPS OF QUICKSILVER AT A TIME OF THE YEAR WHEN BRIGHT SUNSHINE IS NOT VERY FREQUENT I FOUND THAT MY SILVER GLOBULES WOULD SELDOM GIVEOF ASCERTAINING THE MAGNITUDE OF SMALL CELESTIAL BODIES 49 NE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EXPERIMENTS ON SPURIOUS DISKS TO OBVIATE THIS INCONVENIENCE I USED SMALL DROPS OF QUICKSILVER THEY ARE MORE LUCID AND WILL GIVE A BRIGHT SPOT WITH VERY LITTLE SUNSHINE MANY OF THESE DROPS OF ALL SIZES WERE EXPOSED UPON A PLATE OF GLASS AND SOME ON SLIPS OF STEEL THE MANAGE MENT OF THEM IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE GLOBULES FOR IN ORDER TO REPRESENT A DOUBLE STAR THESE MUST BE PLACED ONE ALMOST BEHIND THE OTHER AS OTHERWISE THEY CANNOT BE BROUGHT NEAR ENOUGH WITHOUT RUNNING TOGETHER THE FOLLOWING GENERAL OBSERVATION WILL INCLUDE ALL THE NECESSARY PARTICULARS THE BRIGHT SPOTS ON DROPS OF QUICKSILVER ARE VERY SMALL COMPARED TO THE SIZE OF THE DROPS THEY ARE NOT PROPORTIONAL TO THE MAGNITUDE OF THE DROPS THOUGH LESS ON THE SMALL ONES AND GREATER ON LARGE ONES IN SOME OF THE LARGE ONES THE BRIGHT SPOT IS ABOUT TO OR OF THE DIAMETER OF THE DROP THE MAGNITUDE OF THE LUMINOUS SPOTS IS LIABLE TO CHANGES BUT IS RATHER MORE PERMANENT THAN WITH THE SILVER GLOBULES THERE IS A LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN THE COLOUR OF THE LUMINOUS SPOTS THEY ARE GENERALLY OF A BRILLIANT WHITE BUT SOMETIMES THEY INCLINE TO YELLOW AND THE SM ALL ONES TO ASHCOLOUR WITH HIGH MAGNIFYING POWERS THEY ARE VERY WELL DEFINED AND ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR BRIGHTNESS WILL BEAR THESE POWERS BETTER THAN THE SILVER GLOBULES IF M AND M STAND FOR THE DIAMETERS OF THE LARGE AND SMALL MIRROR OF MY TELESCOPE THEN WILL AN APERTURE    MT 2 GIVE HALF THE LIGHT OF THE TELESCOPE WITH THIS I EXAMINED TWO OF THE DROPS AND FOUND THE LUMINOUS SPOTS UPON THEM WITH MDCCCV H50 DR HERSCHELS EXPEIMENTS THE MEANS 9254 NEARLY EQUAL AND AD DIAMETERS OF THE LARGEST ASUNDER 7063 NEARLY EQUAL AND ABOVE 2 DIAMETERS OF THE LARGEST ASUNDER 4323 PRETTY UNEQUAL AND 2 DIAMETERS OF THE LARGEST ASUNDER 177O CONSIDERABLY UNEQUAL AND I A DIAMETER OF THE LARGEST ASUNDER I EXAMINED ALSO TWO OTHER DROPS WITH DIFFERENT APERTURES WITHOUT CHANGING THE POWER WHICH WAS 7063 EDITH THE INSIDE RAYS THEY WERE VERY LITTLE UNEQUAL AND I DIAMETER OF THE LARGEST ASUNDER WITH THE OUTSIDE RAYS THEY WERE CONSIDERABLY UNEQUAL AND I4 DIAMETER OF THE LARGEST ASUNDER FROM WHAT HAS BEEN SAID IT APPEARS THAT ALL THE REMARKS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE WITH REGARD TO THE SPURIOUS DISKS OF THE SILVER GLOBULES ARE CONFIRMED BY THE LUMINOUS SPOTS ON THE DROPS OF QUICKSILVER THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN THE PROPORTION WHICH THE SPURIOUS DISKS ON QUICKSILVER BEAR TO THE DROPS AND THAT ON THE SILVER GLOBULES TO THE SIZE OF THE GLOBULES THE LATTER ALSO GIVE A GREATER VARIETY OF COLOURS AND MAGNITUDES THAN THOSE ON QUICKSILVER THESE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHICH IT WOULD BE EASY TO ASSIGN THE CAUSE BUT THEY CAN BE OF NO CONSEQUENCE TO THE RESULT WE HAVE DRAWN FROM THE EXPERIMENT 16TH EXPERI NT WITH BLACK AND ZVHTE CIRCLES I TRIED TO MEASURE SOME OF THE SPURIOUS DISKS B Y PROJECTING THEM ON A SCALE WITH A MOVEABLE INDEX BUT FOUND THEIR DIA METERS WERE TOO SMALL FOR ACCURACY BY THIS METHOD FO R THIS REASON I HAD RECOURSE TO ARTIFICIAL MEASURINGDISKS AND PRE  PARED A SET OF ELEVEN WHITE CIRCLES ON A BLACK GROUND AND EIGHT BLACK ONES ON A WHITE GROUND IN ORDER TO GUARD AGAINSTOF ASCERTAININIG THE MAGNITUDE OF SMALL CELESTIAL BODIES I DECEPTIONS I FIXED THEM UP AGAINST A TABLET AI INCHES FROM THE EYE WHERE IT WAS INTENDED TO PROJECT THE SPURIOUS DISKS OF THE GLOBULES AND EXAMINED THEM AT THAT DISTANCE WITH THE NAKED EYE COMPARING THEN THE SIZE OF THE BLACK TO THE WHITE I JUDGED NOI OF THE BLACK TO BE A LITTLE LARGER THAN NO 6 OF THE WVHITE CIRCLES BY A MEASURE TAKEN AFTERWARDS IT APPEARED THAT THE BLACK ONE WAS 4O AND THE WHITE 9 WITHOUT SUP POSING THAT EVERY ESTIMATION MAY BE MADE AT THIS DISTANCE WITH EQUAL ACCURACY T THE HUNDREDTH PART OF AN INCH IT IS SUFI CIENTLY EVIDENT THAT NO MATERIAL DECEPTION CAN TAKE PLACE IN ESTIMATING BY EITHER OF THE SETS OF CIRCLES ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR COLOUR 17TH EXPERIMENT WITH DFERENT II NATIN A SIMILAR EXPERIMENT WAS MADE IN THE MICROSCOPE BY WHICH THE GLOBULES WERE MEASURED TWO OF THEM WERE PLACED ON THE MEASURING STAND AND WITH AN ILLUMINATION FROM BELOW THEY APPEARED BLACK AND WERE PROJECTED ON WHITE PAPER THE DIA METER OF EACH GLOBULE AND THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM WERE THEN MEASURED AFTER THIS I CAUSED THE ILLUMINATION TO COME FROM ABOVE AND THE GLOBULES BEING NOW OF A SILVERY WHITE WERE PROJECTED ON A SLATE IN THIS SITUATION WHEN I REPEATED THE FORMER MEASURES NO DIFFERENCE COULD BE PERCEIVED I8TH EXPERNMENT MEASURES OF SPUN  DISKS THE SPURIOUS DISK OF A GLOBULE WXAS THEN PROJECTED ON THE TABLET WHERE THE WHITE CIRCLES WERE PLACED WHILE I WAS COM PARING IT WITH NO 4 WHICH IS 3I IN DIAMETER AND ESTIMATED IT TO BE A LITTLE LESS THAN THE CIRCLETHE SPURIOUS DISK GREW BRIGHTER BUT IT REMAINED STILL OF THE SAME SIZE SO THAT A VARIATION IN THE QUANTITY OF THE ILLUMINATION WILL MAKE NO DIFFERENCE H25X  DR HERSCHELS EXPERIMENTS ON THE MEANS EVERY THING BEING NOW ARRANGED FOR THE MEASUREMENT I VIEWED THE SPURIOUS DIAMETER WITH A MAGNIFYING POWER OF 5227 AND COMPARED IT TO THE CIRCLES WHICH SUCCEEDED EACH OTHER BY SMALL DIFFERENCES OF MAGNITUDE WITH ALL THE MIRROR FROM THE CENTRE TO 88 INCHES OPEN THE DIAMETER OF THE SPURIOUS DISK WAS FT INCHES WITH 63 INCHES OPEN IT WAS LESS THAN 4O AND LARGER THAN 355 WITH 5 INCHES OPEN IT WAS 4CX XVITH 4 INCHES OPEN IT WAS 42 WITH 3 INCHES OPEN IT WAS 465 NEARLY FROM THESE MEASURES IT MIGHT BE SUPPOSED THAT BY LESSENING THE QUANTITY OF LIGHT WE BRING ON A CERTAIN INDISTINCTNESS WHICH GIVES MORE DIAMETER TO THE SPURIOUS OBJECT TO PROVE THAT THIS IS NOT THE CAUSE OF THE INCREASE I USED THE FOLLOWING APERTURES WITH AN ANNULAR OPENING FROM 65 TO 88 INCHES THE SPURIOUS DISK WAS RATHER LESS THAN I8 WITHII ANOTHER FROM 5 TO 88 IT WAS EXACTLY I8 WITH AN OPENING FROM 4 TO 65 IT WAS 22 WITH ANOTHER FROM 16 TO 4 IT WAS 42 12  NOW SINCE THE OUTSIDE RIM FROM 65 TO 88 WHICH REFLECTED C LESS THAN HALF THE LIGHT OF THE MIRROR PRODUCED A SPURIOUS DISK LESS THAN 18 IN DIAMETER AND THE WHOLE LIGHT AS WE HAVE SEEN GAVE A DISK OF 3 1 IT IS EVIDENTLY NOT THE QUANTITY OF THE LIGHT BUT THE PART OF THE MIRROR FROM WHICH IT IS RE FLECTED THAT WE ARE TO LOOK UPON AS THE CAUSE OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SPURIOUS DISKS OF OBJECTS 13 THESE MEASURES THEREFORE POINT OUT AN IMPROVEMENT IN MY FORMER METHOD OF PUTTING ANY TERRESTRIAL DISK WE SUSPECT TO BE SPURIOUS TO THE TEST FOR THE INSIDE RAYS OF A MIRROR ASOF ASCERTAINZNG THEMAGNITUDE OF SMALL CELESTIAL BODIES 5J BEFORE WILL INCREASE THE DIAMETER OF THESE DISKS BUT THE OUTSIDE RAYS ALONE WILL HAVE A GREATER EFFECT IN REDUCING IT THAN WHEN THE INSIDE RAYS ARE LEFT TO JOIN WITH THEM L9TH EXPERIMENT TRIAL OF ESTIMATIONS I PLACED TWO SILVER GLOBULES AT A SMALL DISTANCE FROM EACH OTHER UPON THE POST BUT WITHOUT MEASURING EITHER THE GLOBULES OR THEIR DISTANCE WHEN I VIEWED THEM WITH 5227 THEY AP PEARED IN THE SHAPE OF TWO HALF MOONS IN AN HORIZONTAL SITUA TION THE UNENLIGHTENED PARTS OF THEM WERE ALSO PRETTY DISTINCTLY VISIBLE I ESTIMATED THE VACANCY BETWEEN THE CUSPS OF THE LUNES TO BE I DIAMETER OF THE LARGEST ON MEASURING THE DIAMETERS AND DISTANCE UNDER THE MICRO SCOPE IT APPEARED THAT THE LARGEST WAS 0312 A QUARTER OF WHICH IS 0078 THE DISTANCE OF THE GLOBULES FROM EACH OTHER MEASURED O 111 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE ESTIMATION OO33 IS LESS THAN 1 PART OF AN INCH THE EXPERIMENT WAS REPEATED WITH A CHANGE OF THE DISTANCE OF THE GLOBULES FROM EACH OTHER THEY WERE THEN ESTIMATED TO BE LESS THAN THE DIAMETER OF THE LARGE ONE ASUNDER BUT FULL THAT OF THE SMALL ONE WHEN THEY WERE MEASURED IT WAS FOUND THAT THEIR DISTANCE WAS 026O 8 AND THE DIAMETER OF THE SMALL ONE WAS 0247 WHICH ESTIMATION IS STILL MORE ACCURATE THAN THE FORMER 20OTH EXPERIMENT USE OF THE CRITERION IT REMAINED NOW TO BE ASCERTAINED WHETHER THESE HALF MOONS WERE SPURIOUS OR REAL FOR ALTHOUGH I COULD ALSO IMPERFECTLY PERCEIVE THE DARK PART OF THE DISKS OF THE GLOBULES YET A DOUBT WOULD ARISE WHETHER THE TWO HALVES WERE REALLY OF EQUALDR HERSCHELS EXPERIMENTS ON THE MEANS MAGNITUDE TO RESOLVE THIS QUESTION I VIEWED THEM FIRST WITH THE INSIDE RAYS OF THE MIRROR THEN WITH THE OUTSIDE AND FOUND THAT IN BOTH CASES THE DISTANCE OF THE LUNES REMAINED WITHOUT THE LEAST ALTERATION I VIEWED THEM ALSO WITH THE WHOLE MIRROR OPEN BUT IT OCCASIONED NO CHANGE G I T EXPERIMENT MEASURES O THE COMPARATIVE AMOUNT OF THE SPUNOUS DIAMETERS PRODUCED BY THE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE RAYS I DIVIDED THE APERTURE OF THE MIRROR INTO TWO PARTS ONE FROM O TO 44 AND THE OTHER FROM 44 TO 88 INCHES WHEN I MEASURED THE SPURIOUSDIAMETER OF A GLOBULE THE INSIDE RAYS MADE IT 4O WITH ALL THE MIRROR OPEN IT WAS 3A AND WITH THE OUTSIDE RAYS IT WAS AEO 14  FROM THIS WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT THE DIAMETERS GIVEN BY THE INSIDE RAYS BY ALL THE MIRROR OPEN AND BY THE OUTSIDE RAS ARE IN AN ARITHMETICAL PROGRESSION AND THAT THE INSIDE RAYS WILL NEARLY DOUBLE THE DIAMETER GIVEN BY THE OUTSIDE IT REMAINS HOWEVER TO BE ASCERTAINED WHETHER THIS WILL HOLD GOOD WITH SPURIOUS DISKS OF VARIOUS MAGNITUDES IT WILL NOT BE NECESSARY TO CARRY THE DIVISIONS OF THE APERTURE FARTHER FOR AS THE APPLICATION OF THESE EXPERIMENTS IS CHIEFLY INTENDED FOR ASTRONOMICAL PURPOSES WE CAN HARDLY DO WITH LESS THAN HALF THE MIRROR OPEN AND ON THE OTHER HAND WITH A VERY NARROW RIM OF REFLECTION FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THE MIRROR DISK TINCTNESS WOULD BE APT TO FAIL E2D EXPERIMENT TRAL OF THE CRITERION ON CELESTIAL OBJECTS I VIEWED A LYRE WITH THE OUTSIDE RAYS AND FOUND ITS SPURIOUS DISK TO BE SMALL WITH ALL THE MIRROR OPEN IT WAS LARGER AND WITH THE INSIDE RAYS IT WAS LARGESTOF ASCERTAINING THE MAGNITUDE OF SMALL CELESTIAL BODIES A AS FAR AS THE IMAGINATION WILL ENABLE US TO COMPARE OBJECTS WE SEE IN SUCCESSION THE MAGNITUDES APPEARED TO BE IN AN ARITHMETICAL PROGRESSION 23D EXPERIMENT I EXAMINED A GEMINORUM WITH 4105 AND WITH THE OUTSIDE RAYS THE STARS WERE CONSIDERABLY UNEQUAL AND 1I DIAMETER OF THE LARGEST ASUNDER WITH ALL THE MIRROR OPEN THEY WERE MORE UNEQUAL AND 1 DIAMETER OF THE LARGEST WITH THE INSIDE RAYS THEY WERE VERY UNEQUAL AND JI OF THE LARGEST ASUNDER THESE EXPERIMENTS SHOW THAT IF IT HAD NOT BEEN KNOWN THAT THE APPARENT DISKS OF THE STARS WERE SPURIOUS THE APPLICATION OF THE IMPROVED CRITERION OF THE APERTURES WOULD HAVE DISCOVERED THEM TO BE SO AND THAT CONSEQUENTLY THE SAME IMPROVEMENT IS PERFECTLY APPLICABLE TO CELESTIAL OBJ ECTS OBSERVATIONS ON THE NATURE AND MAGNITUDE OF MR HARDING S LATELY DISCOVERED STAR IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT IN A FORMER PAPER WHERE I INVESTIGATED THE NATURE OF THE TWO ASTEROIDS DISCOVERED BY SIGNIOR PJIAZZI AND DR OLBERS I SUGGESTED THE PROBABILITY THAT MORE OF THEM WOULD SOON BE FOUND OUT IT MAY THEREFORE BE EASILY SUPPOSED THAT I WAS NOT MUCH SURPRISED WHEN I WAS INFORMED OF MR HARDINKGS VALUABLE DISCOVERY ON THE DAY I RECEIVED AN ACCOUNT OF IT WHICH WAS THE 24TH OF SEPTEMBER I DIRECTED MY TELESCOPE TO THE CALCULATED PLACE OF THE NEW OBJECT AND NOTED ALL THE SMALL STARS WITHIN A LIMITED COMPASS ABOUT IT THEY WERE THEN EXAMINED WITH A DISTINCT HIGH MAG NIFYING POWER AND SINCE NO DIFFERENCE IN THEIR APPEARANCE WAS PERCEIVABLE IT BECAME NECESSARY TO ATTEND TO THE CHANGES THAT56 DR HENSCHELUS EPERMENTS ON THE MEANS MIGHT HAPPEN IN THE SITUATION OF ANY ONE OF THEM THEY WERE DELINEATED AS IN FIG I  PLATE I WHICH IS A MERE EYEDRAUGHT TO SERVE AS AN ELUCIDATION TO A DESCRIPTION GIVEN WITH IT IN THE JOURNAL AND THE STAR MARKED K AS WILL BE SEEN HEREAFTER WAS THE NEW OBJECT SEPT 25 THE MOON WAS TOO BRIGHT TO SEE MINUTE OBJECTS WELL AND MY DESCRIPTION THE NIGHT BEFORE FOR THE SAME REASON BAD NOT BEEN SUFFICIENTLY PARTICULAR  NOR DID I  EXPECT FROM THE ACCOUNT RECEIVED THAT THE STAR HAD RETROGRADED SO FAR IN ITS ORBIT SEPT 26 THE WEATHER BEING VERY HAZY NO REGULAR OBSER VATIONS COULD BE MADE BUT AS I NOTICED VERY PARTICULARLY A STAR NOT SEEN BEFORE IT WAS MARKED I IN FIG 2 AND PROVED AFTERWARDS TO HAVE BEEN THE LATELY DISCOVERED ONE THOUGH STILL UNKNOWN THIS EVENING FOR WANT OF FIXED INSTRUMENTS SEPT 27 1 WAS FAVOURED WITH DR MASKELYNES ACCOUNT OF THE PLACE OF THE STAR TAKEN AT THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY BY WHICH COMMUNICATION I SOON FOUND OUT THE OBJECT I WAS LOOKING FOR SEPT 29 BEING THE FIRST CLEAR NIGHT I BEGAN A REGULAR SERIES OF OBSERVATIONS  AND AS THE POWER OF DETERMINING SMALL ANGLES AND DISTINCTNESS IN SHOWING MINUTE DISKS WHETHER SPURIOUS OR REAL OF THE INSTRUMENT I USED ON THIS OCCASION HAS BEEN SUFFI CIENTLY INVESTIGATED BY THE FOREGOING EXPERIMENTS THERE COULD BE NO DIFFICULTY IN THE OBSERVATION WITH RESOURCES THAT WERE THEN SO WELL UNDERSTOOD AND HAVE NOW BEEN SO IFULLY ASCER TAINED MR HARDENGS NEW CELESTIAL BODY PRECEDES THE VERY SMALL STAR IN FIG I BETWEEN 29 AND 33 PISCIUM AND IS A LITTLE LARGER THAN THAT STAR  IT IS MARKED A FG H ARE TAKEN D FROM FIG I I SUPPOSE G TO BE OF ABOUT THE 9TH MAGNITUDEOF ASCERTAL TING THE ALAGUITUDE OF SMALL CELESTIAL BODIES 5 SO THAT THE NEW STAR MAY BE CALLED A SMALL ONE OF THE T 8TH WITH THE IAOFEET REFLECTOR POWER 4963 I  VIEWED IT ATTEN TIVELY AND COMPARING IT WITH G AND H FIG 3 COULD FIND NO DIFFERENCE IN THE APPEARANCE BUT WHAT MIGHT BE OWING TO ITS BEING A LARGER STAR BY WAY OF PUTTING THIS TO A TRIAL I CHANGED THE POWER TO 8794 BUT COULD NOT FIND THAT IT MAGNIFIED THE NEW ONE MORE THAN IT DID THE STARS G AND H I CANNOT PERCEIVE ANY DISK ITS APPARENT MAGNITUDE WITH THIS POWER IS GREATER THAN THAT OF THE STAR G AND ALSO A VERY LITTLE GREATER THAN THAT OF H BUT IN THE FINDER AND THE NIGHT GLASS G IS CONSIDERABLY SMALLER THAN THE NEW STAR AND H IS ALSO A VERY LITTLE SMALLER I COMPARED IT NOW WITH A STAR WHICH IN THE FINDER APPEARED TO BE A VERY LITTLE LARGER AND IN THE TELESCOPE WITH 8794 THE APPARENT MAGNITUDE OF THIS STAR WAS ALSO LARGER THAN THAT OF THE NEW ONE  AS FAR AS I CAN JUDGE WITHOUT SEEING THE ASTEROIDS OF MR  PIAZZI AND DR OLBERS AT THE SAME TIME WITH MR HARDINGS THE LAST MUST BE AT LEAST AS SMALL AS THE SMALLEST OF THE FORMER WHICH IS THAT OF DR OLBERS THE STAR K FIG A OBSERVED SEPT 24 IS WANTING AND WAS THEREFORE THE OBJECT I WAS IN SEARCH OF WHICH BY COMPUTATION MUST HAVE BEEN THAT DAY IN THE PLACE WHERE I SAW IT THE NEW STAR BEING NOW IN THE MERIDIAN WITH ALL THOSE TO WHICH I AM COMPARING IT AND THE AIR AT THIS ALTITUDE BEING CS VERY CLEAR I STILL FIND APPEARANCES AS BEFORE DESCRIBED THE NEW OBJECT CANNOT BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE STARS BY MAG NIFYING POWER SO THAT THIS CELESTIAL BODY IS A TRUE ASTEROID MDCCCV I38 DR HERSCHELS EXPERIMENTS ON THE MEA NS MR BODES STARS 19 25 AND 27 CETI ARE MARKED 7M AND BY COMPARING THE ASTEROID WHICH I FIND IS TO BE CALLED JUNO WITH THESE STARS IT HAS THE APPEARANCE OF A SMALL ONE OF THE 8TH MAGNITUDE WITH REGARD TO THE DIAMETER OF JUNO WHICH NAME IT WILL AT PRESENT BE CONVENIENT TO USE LEAVING IT STILL TO ASTRONOMERS TO ADOPT ANY OTHER THEY MAY FIX UPON IT IS EVIDENT THAT HAD IT BEEN HALF A SECOND I MUST HAVE INSTANTLY PERCEIVED A VISIBLE DISK SUCH A DIAMETER WHEN I SAW IT MAGNIFIED 8794 TIMES WOULD HAVE APPEARED TO ME UNDER AN ANGLE OF 7 197 ONE HALF OF WHICH IT WILL BE ALLOWED FROM THE EXPERIMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN DETAILED COULD NOT HAVE ESCAPED MY NOTICE OCT I BETWEEN FLYING CLOUDS I SAW THE ASTEROID WHICH IN ITS TRUE STARRY FORM HAS LEFT THE PLACE WHERE I SAW IT SEPT 29 IT HAS TAKEN THE PATH IN WHICH BY CALCULATION I EXPECTED IT WOULD MOVE THIS ASCERTAINS THAT NO MISTAKE IN THE STAR WAS MADE WHEN I OBSERVED IT LAST OCT 29 7H MR HARDINGS ASTEROID IS AGAIN REMOVED BUT IS TOO LOV FOR HIGH POWERS 8H S I VIEWED IT NOW WITH 2O03 2884 45 4963 AND 8794 NO OTHER DISK WAS VISIBLE THAN THAT SPURIOUS ONE WHICH SUCH SMALL STARS HAVE AND WHICH IS NOT PROPORTIONALLY MAG NIFIED BY POWER WITH 2884 THE ASTEROIDS HAD A LARGER SPURIOUS DISK THAN A STAR WHICH WAS A LITTLE LESS BRIGHT ANDL A SMALLER SPURIOUS DISK THAN ANOTHER STAR THAT WAS A LITTLE MORE BRIGHT OCT A WITH 4105 THE SITUATION OF THE ASTEROID IS NOW AS IN FIG 4 I COMPARED ITS DISK WHICH IS PROBABLY THE SPURIOUS APPEARANCE OF STARS OF THAT MAGNITUDE WITH A LARGER AN EQUAL AND A SMALLER STAR IT IS LESS T HAN THE SPURIOUS DISK OF THEOF ASCERTAINING THE MAGNITUDE OF SMALL CELESTIAL BODIES LARGER EQUAL TO THAT OF THE EQUAL AND LARGER THAN THAT OF THE SMALLER STAR THE GRADUAL DIFFIERENCE BETWEEN THE THREE STARS IS EXCEEDINGLY SMALL WITH 4963 AND THE AIR UNCOMMONLY PURE AND CALM I SEE SO WELL THAT I AM CERTAIN THE DISK IF IT BE NOT A SPURIOUS ONE IS LESS THAN ONE OF THE SMALLEST GLOBULES I SAW THIS MORNING IN THE TREE THE DIAMETER OF THIS GLOBULE WAS 02 IT SUBTENDED AN ANGLE OF PIL 429 AND WAS OF SEALINGWAX HAD IT BEEN A SILVER ONE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN STILL MORE VISIBLE WITH 8794 ALL CWPARATIVE MAGNITUDES OF THE ASTEROID AND STARS REMAIN AS WITH 4963 I SEE THE MINUTE DOUBLE STAR Q OPHIUCHI  IN HIGH PERFECTION WHICH PROVES THAT THE AIR IS CLEAR AND THE TELESCOPE IN GOOD ORDER THE ASTEROID BEING NOW IN THE MERIDIAN AND THE AIR VERY PURE I THINK THE COMPARATIVE DIAMETER IS A LITTLE LARGER THAN THAT OF AN EQUAL STAR AND ITS LIGHT ALSO DIFFERS FROM STARLIGHT ITS APPARENT MAGNITUDE HOWEVER CAN HARDLY BE EQUAL TO THAT OF THE SMALLEST GLOBULE I SAW THIS MORNING THIS GLOBULE MEASURED O1358 AND AT THE DISTANCE OF 96204 INCHES SUB TENDED AN ANGLE OF O214 WHEN I VIEWED THE ASTEROID WITH 8794 I FOUND MORE HAZI NESS THAN AN EQUAL STAR WOULD HAVE GIVEN BUT THIS I ASCRIBE TO WANT OF LIGHT WHAT I CALL AN EQUAL STAR IS ONE THAT IN AN ACHROMATIC FINDER APPEARS OF EQUAL LIGHT OCT 7 MR HARDINGS ASTEROID HAS CONTINUED ITS RETROGRADE MOTION THE WEATHER IS NOT CLEAR ENOUGH TO ALLOW THE USE OF LIGH POWERS  SEE CAT OF DOUBLE STARS I 87R I 160 DR HERSCHELS EXPERIMENTS ON THE MEANS OCT 8 IF THE APPEARANCE RESEMBLING THE SPURIOUS DISKS OF SMALL STARS WHICH I SEE WITH 4105 IN MR HARDINGS ASTEROID SHOULD BE A REAL DIAMETER ITS QUANTITY THEN BY ESTIMATION MAY AMOUNT TO ABOUT OD3 THIS JUDGMENT IS FOUNDED ON THE FACILITY WITH WHICH I CAN SEE TWO GLOBULES OFTEN VIEWED FOR THIS PURPOSE THE ANGLE OF THE FIRST IS OL29 AND OF THE OTHER O0214 AND THE ASTEROID MIGHT BE LARGER THAN THE LATTER BUT CERTAINLY WAS NOT EQUAL TO THE FORMER WITH 4963 THERE IS AN ILL DEFINED HAZY APPEARANCE BUT NOTHING THAT MAY BE CALLED A DISK VISIBLE WHEN THERE IS A GLIMPSE OF MORE CONDENSED LIGHT TO BE SEEN IN THE CENTRE IT IS SO SMALL THAT IT MUST BE LESS THAN TWOTENTHS OF A SECOND TO DECIDE WHETHER THIS APPARENT CONDENSED LIGHT WAS A REAL OR SPURIOUS DISK I APPLIED DIFFERENT LIMITATIONS TO THE APERTURE OF THE TELESCOPE BUT FOUND THAT THE LIGHT OF THE NEW STAR WAS TOO FEEBLE TO PERMIT THE USE OF THEM FROM THIS I CONCLUDED THAT AN LINCREASE OF LIGHT MIGHT NOW BE OF GREAT USE AND VIEWED THE ASTEROID WITH A FINE IOFEET MIRROR OF 2 INCHES DIAMETER BUT FOUND THAT NOTHING WAS GAINED BY THE CHANGE THE TEM PERATURE INDEED OF THESE LARGE MIRRORS IS VERY SELDOM THE SAME AS THAT OF THE AIR IN WHICH THEY ARE TO ACT AND TILL A PERFECT UNIFORMITY TAKES PLACE NO HIGH POWERS CAN BE USED THE ASTEROID IN THE MERIDIAN AND THE NIGHT BEAUTIFUL AFTER MANY REPEATED COMPARISONS OF EQUAL STARS WITH THE ASTEROID I THINK IT SHOWS MORE OF A DISK THAN THEY DO BUT IT IS SO SMALL THAT IT CANNOT AMOUNT TO SO MUCHI AS TENTHS OF A SECOND OR AT LEAST TO NO MORE IT IS ACCOMPANIED WITH RATHER MORE NEBULOSITY THAN STARS OF TNE SAME SIZEOF ASCERTAINZNG THE MAGNITUDE OF SMALL CELESTIAL BODIES GX THE NIGHT IS SO CLEAR THAT I CANNOT SUPPOSE VISION AT THIS ALTITUDE TO BE LESS PERFECT ON THE STARS THAN IT IS ON DAY OBJECTS AT THE DISTANCE OF 8CC FEET IN A DIRECTION ALMOST HORIZONTAL OCT I I BY COMPARING THE ASTEROID ALTERNATELY AND OFTEN WITH EQUAL STARS ITS DISK IF IT BE A REAL ONE CANNOT EXCEED 2 OR AT MOST 3TENTHS OF A SECOND THIS ESTIMATION IS FOUNDED ON THE COMPARATIVE READINESS WITH WHICH EVERY FINE DAY I HAVE SEEN GLOBULES SUBTENDING SUCH ANGLES IN THE SAME TELESCOPE AND WITH THE SAME MAGNIFYING POWER THE ASTEROID IS IN THE MERIDIAN AND IN HIGH PERFECTION I PERCEIVE A WELL DEFINED DISK THAT MAY AMOUNT TO 2 OR 3TENTHS OF A SECOND BUT AN EQUAL STAR SHOWS EXACTLY THE SAME AP PEARANCE AND HAS A DISK AS WELL DEFINED AND AS LARGE AS THAT OF THE ASTEROID RESULT AND APPLICA1 ION OF THE EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS WE MAY NOW PROCEED TO DRAW A FEW VERY USEFUL CONCLUSIONS FROM THE EXPERIMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN GIVEN AND APPLY THEM TO THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE STAR DISCOVERED BY MR HARDING AND ALSO TO THE SIMILAR STARS OF MR PIAZZI AND DR OLBERS THESE KIND OF COROLLARIES MAY BE EXPRESSED AS FOLLOWS I  A IOFEET REFLECTOR WILL SHOW THE SPURIOUS OR REAL DISKS OF CELESTIAL AND TERRESTRIAL OBJECTS WHEN THEIR DIAMETER IS  OF A SECOND OF A DEGREE AND WHEN EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE IS FAI VOURABLE SUCH A DIAMETER MAY BE PERCEIVED SO DISTINCTLY THAT IT CAN BE DIVIDED BY ESTIMATION INTO TWO OR THREE PARTS 2 A DISK OF X OF A SECOND IN DIAMETER WHETHER SPURIOUS OR REAL IN ORDER TO BE SEEN AS A ROUND WELL DEFINED BODY6S LDR HERSCHEL S EPERINENTS ON THE MEANS REQUIRES A DISTINCT MAGNIFYING POWER OF J OR 6 HUNDRED AND MUST BE SUFFICIENTLY BRIGHT TO BEAR THAT POWER S A REAL DISK OF HALF A SECOND IN DIAMETER WILL BECOME 0O MUCH LARGER BY THE APPLICATION OF A MAGNIFYING POWER OF 5 OR 6 HLUNDRTED THAT IT WILL BE EASILY DISTII GUISHED FROM AN EQUAL SPURIOUS ONE THE LATTER NOT BEING AFFECTED BY POWER IN THE SAME PROPORTION AS THE FORIMER 4 THE DIFFERENT EFFECTS OF THE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE RAYS OF A MIRROR WITH REGARD TO THE APPEARANCE OF A DISK ARE A CRITERION THAT WILL SHOW WHETHER IT IS REAL OR SPURIOUS PROVIDED ITS DIAMETER IS MORE THAN I OF A S COND  S WHEN DISKS EITHER SPURIOUS OR REAL ARE LESS THAN I OF A SECOND IN DIAMETER THEY CANNOT BE DISTINGUISLHED FROM EACH OTHER BECAUSE THE MAGNIFYING POWER WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO MAKE THEM APPEAR ROUND AND WELL DEFINED 6  THE SAME KIND OF EXPERIMENTS ARE APPLICABLE TO TELE SCOPES OF DIFFERENT SORTS AND SIZES BUT WILL GIVE A DIFFERENT RESULT FOR THE QUANTITY WHICH HAS BEEN STATED AT V OF A SECOND OF A DEGREE THIS WILL BE MORE WHEN THE INSTRUMENT IS LESS PERFECT AND LESS WHEN IT IS MORE SO IT WILL ALSO DIFFR EVEN WITH THE SAME INSTRUMENT ACCORDING TO THE CLEARNESS OF THE AIR THE CONDITION AND ADJUS TMENT OF THE MIRRORS AND THE PRACTICAL HABITS OF THE OBSEVVER WITH REGARD TO MR HARDINGS NEW STARRY CELESTIAL BODY WE HAVE SHOWN BY OBSERVATION THAT IT

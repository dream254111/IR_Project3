THE club met on Saturday February 28 in the Randal Morgan Physical Laboratory and listened to a paper by Mr Homer M Derr on  Chromatic Interference with Thin Section o Doubly vRefracting Crystals in tolarized Light The paper contained in brief the theory of the colors of thin rock sections as seen through a polarizing mieroscope and discussed the practicability of using the same as a means of analysis when chemical action was insufficient to detect certain minerals Mr Derr is constructing a table of the colors up to the fourth order of dif3erent min erals with varying thicknesses for qualitative analysis in petrology At a meeting of the club on March  a paper was presented by Mr J Frank Meyer which reviewed the history of electric convection from the beginning to its present culmination in the dispute between Cremieu and Prender There was a full attendance at the meeting JOS H HART Secretary DISCUSSION AND CORRESPONENCE WILLMAKING To TIIE EDITOR OF SCIENCE ilErofessor Cham berlains suggestion in SaIENaE March 6 page 39I that wills should be prohated during the lifetime of the testator has been frequently made to legislatures and just as frequently rejected It was one of the matters consid ered and rejected by the judges committee in the recentKrevision of Colorado probate law In the first place the suggestion assumes that will disputes and the socalled  break ing of wills  are matters of very common oc currence which though a popular supposition is to those whose business is the administration of probate law known to be entirely incorrect An attack upon a will is the exception and a successful attack even vastly rarer The few cases of rejededwills are published far andwide in the newspapers while the thousands admit ted to probate without contest never are heard of by the public creating an erroneous impres sion I have had personal knowledge of hun dreds of wills and while I have heard of such instances and read of them in the newspapers and judicial reports yet have never personally known of refusal to admit a will to probate except in a few cases in which the paper was not attested by the proper number of witnesses During the last year I have been constantly in communication and conference with other judges having probate jVrisdiction and with probate lawyers and have found that to be the common experience If men fail to have their wills witnessed by the statutory number of witnesses they would be as apt to fail to probate them during lifetime as it would be only another means of having them witnessed Then too the tendency would be to discourage wills by making the process more complicated and making it impossible in cases where the testator is far from court and physically un able to travel or when death is imminent and time therefore limited Furthermore the question of its construction and effect could not be properly and safely determined by the court in a purely ex porte proceeding and if it could in many cases a decree thus drawn without a knowledge of the future would it self often come up for construction later on62 SCIENCsE NS VOLXII 50434 It is doubtful in any case whether it is advisable to override a fundamental principle of civilized jurisprudence to wit that  every man should have his day in court Fraud would be much easier under such a system While in a mental condition unfitting him to do business but not manifesting itself to the court on casual inspection or under un due influence through fear or other causes a man is brought by beneficiaries under his will before a probate court and his will admitted to probate Then his life is taken bJr the beneficiaries No matter what facts they might be able absolutely to prove the mouths of his heirs who have never had a chance to be heard are closed They can not attack the probate so the will stands and the prop erty goes where neither the law nor the testator wished it to go On the whole the sugges tion seems a dangerous one The Colorado probate revision committee considered the remedy suggested much more dangerous than the disease JUNIUS HENDERSON CURRENT NOTES ON PHYSIOG1VAPHY  SNAKE RIVER IJAVA PLAINS RUSSELL2S latest report on the  Geology and Water Resources of the Snake River Plains of Idaho  U S Geol Survey Bull 199 1902 is as full of physiographic matter as many of his earlier reports have been The plains are in southern Idaho measuring 350 miles in length by from 50 to TS miles in width they occupy a broad depression between enclosing mountains and are built of estensive basaltic lava flows often overlying Tertiary  lake beds The lavas have been ascribed to Sssure erup tions but Russell follows Lindgren in refer ring them to volcanic vents within the area of the plains or in the neighboring mountains Several lava streams issue from the mountain valleys one oE them was so liquid when crupted that after flowing fully 50 miles as a streain from one to three miles wide it could still spread widely on the plains The vents within the plains are either cinder cones of the ordinary type from which very fresh flows are traceable or low broad lava cones of gentle slope 8 to 10 miles in basal diameter and only i00 or S00 fed high The more liquid flows thin out gradually on the plains to feather edges others are limited by ragged scarps 20 or 30 feet high The border of the plains contours around the enclosing moun tains converting valleys into bays spurs into headlands and outlying knobs into  steptoes p 34 The most remarkable examples of the latter forms are two dissected rhyolitic volcanoes of which the highest Big Butte rises 2350 feet over the plains In one dis trict of fresh flows a road between two towns forty miles apart follows the slight depression between the edge of the lava and the mountain slope turning into every valley and rounding every spur and thus doubling the straightline distance rather than climb the hills or cross the bare lava Most of the plains are covered with a soil largely aeolian Estensive grave fans are formed where certain streams have had to aggrade their courses on passing from mountain valleys of strong slope to the level plains here Russell unfortunately introduces the term v upgrading streams  p 133 a1 though he has used aggrading in his Rivers of North America Some fans antedate the lavas and stretch under them favoring the pas sage of ground water beneath the plains Snake Eliver and its larger branches trench the plain where it is lavacovered and produce a mature topography in the unprotected lake beAs further west Special account is given of short canyons eroded by springs along the border of Snake River canyon THE FAN OF L KNNEMEZAN THE glXeat fan or  plateau  of Ijannemezan with a radius of more than 100 kilom at the foot of the Pyrenees in southwestern France together with its smaller neighbors on the west the fans of Orignac and Ger have long been noted for the unsymmetrical form of their radial consequent valleys whose side slopes are with few exceptloxls steeper on the right than on the left of the stream It has frequently been suggested that this systemat ically unsymmetrical habit might be due to the deflective force arising from the earths rotation and the suggestion has as often been doubted because the deflective force must be so szna11 A thcalough stw4y of the problem

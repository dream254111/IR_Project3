HISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY Denmark Scientific investigation into prehistoric anthropology began in Denmark in the  Address by the VicePresident and Chairman of Section H American Association for the Advance ment of Science Fortyeighth Meeting Columbus Meeting August 21 1889N S VOL X No 252 early part of the present century Its start was more the result of accident than design The King of Denmark provided in 1806 for a scientific investigation of his country corresponding in some degrees with the ag gregate duties with what in our country are the Geological Survey the Natural History Division of our National Museum and De partment of Agriculture and the Bureau of Ethnology Dolmes Almost the first obstacle the Committee met and which being unable to explain caused it to put on its studying cap and led to an extensive discussion was a dolmen one of the common and now wellknown prehistoric burial places Associated with the discovery were the stone hatchets both polished and chipped for polishing also now so well known The studies of the historian and archeologist failed utterly in assigning any of these to any period or people known in historic times The an cient Sagas were studied in detail but never developed an age of culture wherein axes other than those of iron were used As the Commissions investigations were extended the number of these objects both dolmens and axes Were increased and other imple ments were added to the list Denmark kept the lead in her interest in the discoveries relating to prehistoric man and in the formation of the new science which was to become prehistoric anthro pology Shell Heaps  Another Commission was formed com posed of Professors Forschhammer Steen strup and Worsaae the latter of whom was the special representative of the Science of Archeology though the other two would perhaps have been equally as great in archeology had they not already been cele brated by their earlier work in biology and geology Worsaaes labors as an archeol ogist were overshadowed by his subsequent greatness as a statesman he became one of the Cabinet Ministers of the Kingdom and died in office The Committee continued the investiga tions into the new science by the discovery of the shell mounds That at Havelse was first and became the representative speci men but it was soon found that shell mounds or deposits existed along the coast in every direction and what had thereto fore been supposed to be the natural surface of the land was really the result of human labor and the evidence of human occupa tion The farmers and land owners in their respective neighborhoods had already discovered that these mounds were not oomposed of the usual sand and clay but mostly shells which in a state of great de cay were more or less mingled with black soil and they had carted away much of the material to be distributed over the sur face of their fields for enrichment An investigation commenced at Havelse showed not only the artificial character of these shell mounds but the presence of many pieces of stone principally flint which had been broken in such way as to indicate human intervention and an adap tation to human use These objects ran pretty nearly the entire range of prehistoric implements as we now know them ham merstones axes hatchets flakes scrapers arroWpoints spearheads knives spindle whorls gouges crescents daggers etc There were also objects of shell horn and bone and many fragments of pottery The more important implements from certain deposits were found to be of stone with a piercing point or a cutting edge mostly chipped into shape though some had been pecked or battered and then ground or polished In other deposits objects of different ma terial were found and among the rest the presence of bronze implements was de tected 586 SCIENCESCIENCE The number and kind of these imple ments their methods of burial or deposit with the associated objects enabled the archeologist to assign to them a chrono logical sequence first in epochs of culture and second in improvement made within these groups These epochs of culture divided them selves according to the material employed for cutting implements into the ages of stone bronze and iron This was the first step in the establishment of the new science of Prehistoric Anthropology The Royal Danish Museum of Antiquities was estab lished in 1816 now occupying the Princes sen Palace at Copenhagen It was to be the home of the archeological collections of the Kingdom and here Mr Thomson with the aid of Professors Forschhammer and Steenstrup classified arranged and displayed the objects found and here the new science was born Lake Dwellings In 1853 and 1854 the waters of the Swiss Lakes were from natural causes reduced to a low stage and Dr Ferdinand Keller em ployed the opportunity to investigate cer tain peculiarities which reported to him by the fishermen and builders on the waters edge had excited his curiosity One of these was that certain localities with a sloping shore apparently well suited for drawing the seine were rendered useless for this kind of fishing because of obstruc tions believed to be decayed stumps of a sub merged forest covering the bottom catching the leadline which had to be lifted the lifting of which allowed the fish to escape It appeared that excavations had been made during a period of comparatively low water in the year 1829 as for a building wherein the piles and other objects of great antiquity believed to have been Roman had been found Being thus satisfactorily accounted for their discoverers gave them 587 no further heed and the objects were not brought to the attention nor submitted to the inspection of any antiquarian Dr Kellers first surprise was at the number of these stumps the similarity of their ap pearance and the regularity with which they had grown His surprise was in creased when on lifting one out from its bed it was found not to be a stump but a sharpened and pointed pilebearing evidence of human workmanship which had been driven into the ground A cursory exami nation showed this to be the condition of all This was evidence of a previous human occupation and as the late discovery in Denmark began to have its effect upon the mind of Keller it became apparent that these were the evidences of a human occu pation of the Swiss Lakes at some prehis toric period This ripened into a certainty when it was discovered that like conditions existed in other places not only in Lake Zurich but in divers other of the lakes Reports of these from both Switzerland and Denmark spread over western Europe and naturally excited the interest and curiosity of many thinking men especially those of France and England The objects them selves were passed about and descriptions of them with illustrations were brought under the eyes of the people of these countries who turned their attention to similar known objects of their own countries theretofore unrecognized Like the dis coveries in Denmark and Switzerland the great interest centered in the similarity of the respective implements in the various classes found in these widelyseparated countries If I recur to this question of the similarity of implements found in dif ferent countries it is because of its im portance It formed the foundation of the science It was by reason of this similarity that the Scandinavian discoverers and early students were able to determine the prehistoric ages By comparison of imple OCTOBER 27 1899N S VOL X No 252 ments of their own countries with those of Scandinavia and a recognition of the simi larity between them the students from other countries of Western Europe were enabled to correlate and identify the culture of the prehistoric man and this knowl edge finally crystallized into the universal recognition of the three prehistoric ages of stone bronze and iron The prehistoric man had but few kinds of implements the hammer or maul the hatchet the knife scraper arrowpoint and spearhead spindlewhorl points of bone and horn objects principally ornaments of shell and pottery These implements were sub stantially the same in every locality so far as concerned the Neolithic period The polished stone hatchets were identical whether found in the dolmens of France and England the dolmens and shell heaps of Scandinavia the lake dwellings of Switzerland or the terramare of Italy and in after years as our knowledge of the pre historic world increased this similarity was found to extend throughout the Eastern and Western Hemispheres as well as the islands of the sea The similarity was not confined to one class of implements but in cluded nearly all in every age To be sure there were minor differences but the imple ments could be recognized as the same whenever found For example the hatchets were long or short had a head or poll well finished or left rude and were round flat or square in section Those square in sec tion were from Scandinavia short stumpy ones with unfinished poll from the British Islands the poll pointed or rounded and well finished from Continental Europe the buttonheaded from Brittany But with all this they were always the same imple ment The material might differ with the locality but otherwise as to use and method of manufacture they appeared the same As investigation proceeded this similarity of implement extended The polished stone hatchet of America was found to be the same with the same differences of detail some from Illinois made of flint have a spreading edge almost of a crescent form the corners forming the points after the style of some of the battleaxes of medieval knights those from Chiriqui are flattened on both sides by a sort of chamfer which makes them appear hexagonal in section It has been argued that this similarity of implement was due to the similarity of human thought adapted to human neces sity The similarity of human thought and action under the same necessities may be admitted although it necessarily had its limitations The similarity of the implements found among different peoples widely separated is not accounted for by the theory of human thought and human needs The classifica tion of prehistoric culture into ages of stone bronze and iron was based on the similarity of the implements in each age found in the respective countries and this was the result of migration communication or contact be tween the peoples Discoveries of Darwin and Boucher de Perthes By the middle of the century students of prehistoric matters of the Old World had about accepted the prehistoric ages of stone bronze and iron Some attempts were made to discover the man who had made and used these implements and the few skulls that had been gathered in earlier times the significance of which had not then been understood were subjected to re examination in view of the new light upon prehistoric matters Chief among these were the Canstadt skull discovered in 1706 and the Engis skull in 1822 In these studies the pathway of prehistoric science and knowledge was being slowly blazed when in the year 1859 two great discov eries relating to the origin and antiquity of man were published which had something 588 SCIENCEOCTOBER 27 1899 of the effect of an earthquake upon former scientific conclusions One the origin of the human species through evolution by Darwin and the other the acceptance as artificial of the paleolithic implements found by M Boucher de Perthes in the val ley of the Somme Boucher de Perthes had as early as 1836 but seriously since 1841 been investigating the peculiarities of certain chipped flints found at Abbeville France as far south as Amiens along the line of the canals and railroads then in course of construction These he had recognized as the work of man and claim ing for them the highest antiquity he as serted them to be antediluvian His dis covery was at first unfavorably received In 1853 Dr Rigollot announced his adhe sion to the theory in 1859 Dr Falconer discovered the presence of the bones of Elephas antiquus at St Acheul and their as sociation more or less intimate with the chipped flint implements of Boucher de Perthes In 1859 numerous geologists of England visited the locality and some of them especially Mr Arthur J Evans now Curator of the Ashmolean Museum Oxford then a lad accompanying his father Sir John Evans had the good fortune to find one of the chipped flint implements in situ There was much contention over the propo sition connecting man with these imple ments and there were many unbelievers Some disputed the antiquity of the deposit others the human manufacture of the im plements and curiously enough the great est opposition came from the French geol ogists and the greatest support from the English It is not here declared that the geological formation was not early understood by eminent scientists who vis ited the locality but there does not appear to have been any publication in extenso of that formation and the strata of which it is composed and the fauna found therein until that of M DAult Du Mesnil in the Revue Mensuelle de lEcole dAnthropologie Sixieme Ann6e IX 1896 and of which I translated and published the general por tions in the American Antiquarian Vol XXI No 3 1899 pp 137145 There were found to be several geologic and paleontologic strata In the lower layers the bones and teeth of Elephas merid ionalis were found associated with the Rhi noceros merkii in the middle strata the Elephas primigenius and the Elephas antiqusu were mingled while in the upper layers the Elephas primigenius alone appeared The implements in the lower strata were large and rude while in the upper they be came smaller and finer and better made forming the type called by M DAult Du Mesnil St Acheull6en The surface layer contained objects belonging to the later ages and does not here concern us The discussion over the theory of the human origin of these implements soon came to a close by its general acceptance There have been continuous and almost illimit able discussions over details but none over the general proposition One swallow does not make a summer and a single discovery either of an implement or a lo cality is of slight value in the establish ment of any general proposition in prehis toric anthropology If the discovery of chipped flint implements had been confineC to those of Boucher de Perthes they never would have made any headway But the attention of those interested in the subject having been attracted to these chipped flint implements they were as the polished stone hatchets in the Neolithic period had been previously found in greater or less numbers in many localities throughout the principal countries of western Europe Then came a comparison of the same im plements from different localities and it was decided that they were related and formed a stage of culture so different from that of polished stone as to show that they SCIENCE 589N S VOL X No 252 belonged to another people occupying the country at an earlier date To this period Sir John Lubbock gave the name Paleo lithic These chipped flint implements were found by scores of investigators and search ers in hundreds of places to the number of tens of thousands As before remarked it was the likeness or similarity of the implements not only in general form but in the details as well as in their material mode of manufacture and possible method of use which clinched the argument They so closely resemble each other in the details as to show to the stu dent that the men who made and used them not only belonged all to the same stage of culture but that either through migration or commerce they must have had intercom munication They might or might not have been bloodrelatives but that they were really acquaintances and taught each other the modes of fracture of these imple ments seems to have been admitted on all hands The discoveries of the prehistoric ages of stone have been extended to Africa Pro fessor H W Haynes and General Pitt Rivers in Egypt and Mr SetonKarr in Somaliland have made discoveries of pale olithic implements Discoveries of neo lithic implements have been made by Mr J de Morgan in the valley of the Nile and by a Belgian in the valley of the Congo All have been found in suffi cient numbers to establish the fact that they were not isolated or sporadic speci mens but were evidence of an extensive human occupation of their locality Differences Between Paleolithic and Neolithic Cultures In treating of the science of prehistoric anthropology it is imperative that the dif ferences between the culture of paleolithic and neolithic times should be noticed Necessarily this must be confined to the Old World as the discoveries in America have not been sufficient to establish the lines between the two periods Mons Gabriel de Mortillet formulated the differences between his Madelainien epoch the last of the Paleolithic period and his Robenhausen epoch the first of the Neolithic period and has arranged them in parallel columns that they may make a graphic representation LATEST PALEOLITHIC 1 Climate cold and dry with extreme tempera tures 2 Existence of the last grand fossil species the mammoth 3 Chamois marmot the wild goat in the plains

that they were in different geologic epochs The former be longed to the quaternary the latter to the present epoch In the transition from the Paleolithic to the Neolithic the glaciers ceased the climate became temperate and 590 SCJENCESCIENCE uniform the animals peculiar to the earlier conditions passed away and others affected by the change of climate migrated There were eighteen species of coldloving animals in western Europe during the Paleolithic period which migrated to other localities because of the moderation of the tempera ture incident to the commencement of the Neolithic period Thirteen of these mi grated to cold countries by latitude going to the north the reindeer the msikox the blue fox etc five like the chamois and mountain goat migrated to cold countries by altitude going up on the mountains Comparing the industries of the two periods we will see some of those of the earlier continued into the later periods and some of those the later were invented or improved The art of chipping stone into implements was continued from the earlier to the later but to it was added the art of grinding and polishing All our smoothed and polished stone implements and objects had their origin in this neolithic culture Sawing and drilling stone began here The bow and arrow the first projectile machinery in the world here had its birth The twisting of flaxen thread weaving and the making of cloth clothing com menced in this period Pottery making was begun which in itself wrought a revo lution in human culture The earliest monuments of the world the great mounds tumuli dolmens menhirs cromlechs and the fine specimens of prehistoric architec ture date from this period The family was formed and the clan or tribe organized with a local habitation and a name Villages and finally towns were established animals were domesti cated flocks and herds with farms and pastures came into being agriculture in creased the means of subsistence a division of labor became fixed and mechanics with trades were partially inaugurated Though the neolithic man from our point of view was a savage yet compared with his pre decessor the paleolithic man he made a long stride towards civilization whether from savagery to barbarism may be sug gested but need not be decided nor even argued here Paleolithic Implements Employed The recognition of the artificial character of the chipped flint implements found by Boucher de Perthes and the many who came after him and which gave an impetus to the science of prehistoric anthropology made an opportunity if it did not create a necessity for some sort of classification The Scandinavian classification of stone bronze and iron had been accepted but these late discoveries demonstrated an earlier period and called for a subdivision of the age of stone All the implements found were of flint and chipped During this period man did not know how to rub one stone against another to make either of them smooth or sharp as he did in the later age so the first was called the chipped stone age and the other the polished stone age Sir John Lubbock gave them the names respectively Paleolithic and Neolithic These paleo lithic implements of chipped flint being found mostly in the alluvial gravels the name alluvial alluvium French diluvial diluvium English were respectively given them These implements and the period to which they belong require a description by which they can be recognized from those of other ages They were all of flint or some chipp able material many of them were made from boulders or concretions Some were so chipped as to leave the smooth part of the boulder as a grip for the hand They varied in length from six or eight inches down to three in width from five to two and in thickness from three inches to one OCTOBER 27 1899 591N S VOL X No 252 They were generally almondshaped and had a point or cutting edge at the small end some of them made from ledgerock and not from boulders were brought to an edge all round In outline they resemble the leaf shaped implements of later ages but when viewed edgewise the difference was manifest in that these were much thicker The thickness is usually about half their width  an implement four inches wide would be about two inches thick and one two inches wide an inch thick while leafshaped implements of that width would not be onehalf as thick River Drifts Valleys and Terraces A further explanation is as to the forma tion of the geologic deposits in which the implenments were found and so a decision as to their geologic age It is believed that at an earlier period in the geology of the country the water of the rivers on its way to the sea eroded the earth as is shown by the geologic models principally of the Rocky Mountains in the U S National Museum and formed valleys making them reach from one hill to the other and as deep as the present bottom of the rivers at the second stage the water in the rivers becoming less in volume and slower in movement began the process which has been carried on from that day to the present in all river valleys the cutting or washing of the river bank at or from one point or locality where the water ran swifter and stronger and carrying it further down the stream where the water ran slower and weaker In this manner the river terraces were formed each successive terrace counting from the hill represented a cor responding abasement of the water until as at present in many of our American rivers especially the Ohio three terraces exist on either side of the stream In the chronologic formation of these terraces that nearest the hill was the oldest that nearest the stream the latest The bottom of each terrace was naturally laid down first and consequently was older than the top So the bottom of the first terrace nearest the hill was the oldest and the top of the ter race that nearest the stream was the latest These paleolithic implements have been found in the bottom of the first terrace and consequently were a part of the earliest deposit And as they continued through out the various terraces and in the different parts thereof it is believed that the Paleo lithic period in these localities began with the formation of the rivervalleys and is co existent with them During all this period no implements of less enduring material than flint have been found if any ever existed No human remains have ever been found in the river valleys nor the remains of any animal so small as man or whose bones were so light and frail as are his Differences in Climate No traces have been brought to light of either the habitation or the raiment of the man of this period It has been suggested that he had no need for either The cli mate was warm moist and rainy he re quired neither dwelling nor raiment to keep him warm or dry for like the savages of warm climates generally he may have preferred to run naked This is regarded as entirely feasible in the climate then pre vailing in western Europe But there came a change supposed to be represented by the glacial epoch when the climate became cold and wet and man re quired protection and so was driven to the caverns for shelter Here is found the first evidence of raiment Thus began what has been called the cavern period Epochs of the Cavern Period Different classifications have been made and different names given to these Some 592 SCTENOETOBER 27 1899 of the early scientists named them for the animals of the time and locality Lartet named them respectively Cave Bear Mam moth Reindeer and Ox Dupont Mam moth and Reindeer The English gener ally employed the terms riverdrift for the earlier paleolith and cavern De Mortillet made an exhaustive study and a consequent elaborate classification named for and based on the industries found in certain localities The Chelleen after Chelles SeineetMarne Acheull6en after St Acheul Somme Mousterien after the cavern of Le Moustier Dordogne Solu treen after the station of Solutr6 Soneet Loire Madalenien after the rockshelter of La Madeleine Dordogne and Tour assien after La Tourasse HauteGaronne the last representing the hiatus between the Paleolithic and Neolithic ages This classi fication was carried throughout the pre historic ages experience will satisfy one of its excellence Its principle is to give an epoch of culture the name of a locality where that particular culture is manifested in its greatest purity This may be an arbitrary system but it has the great desideratum of all systems of nomenclaturecertainty and definiteness By such one knows exactly what is meant and this is the chief purpose of nomen clature The American geologic classifica tion is based largely on the same system HighPlateau Paleoliths Ightham Kent Among many discoveries of paleolithic implements in Europe was a certain class which indicated a human occupation earlier than those found in the river gravels These belong to the high plateaux between the headwaters of the streams The principal discovery of implements of this class was by Mr Benjamin Harrison of Ightham Kent but knowledge of the significance thereof is Mons de Mortillets classification

Prestwich SCIENCE 593N S VOL X No 252 A small stream runs past the town of Ightham where it joins the Medway This stream has the usual terraces in its valley whichlike other terraces are formed of river drift These valleys contained paleolithic implements of the usual kind similar to those heretofore described The theory was that the rivervalley had been eroded the sand and gravel cut or washed away then carried down the stream and deposited where the current became weaker thus would be in volved all the paleolithic implements within the scope of the valley or ravines that fell into it The information furnished by Mr Harrisons discovery was that on the high plateau levels not involved in the valleys or the ravines leading to it the same kind of paleolithic implements were found practi cally on the surface The theory of Pro fessor Prestwich founded on Harrisons dis covery carries us back one step further in the chronology of paleolithic man He be lieved that the implements were made and used by man on these high plateaux before the commencement of the formation of the rivervalley that being scattered over the surface where they had been left by their owners they have remained until now found undisturbed uninfluenced by the erosion the which as it proceeded cut away the sand and gravel and drew the the other implements into the valley or into the general current which carried the sand and gravel down and deposited them with the debris in the form of a terrace These Harrison implements not being within the reach of this erosion re mained in situ and are now being found on the surface of the plateau above Imple ments and even workshops indicated by the presence of certain tools and style of implements remained on the high plateaux and are there found today If they had been within the influence of the stream and had been carried down by its waters they would have been found in the drift of the terrace below but not having been thus in volved they were not affected and so re mained in their original places until now found This conclusion if correct pushes the paleolithic one epoch farther into the past instead of the implements being found in the bottom of the river terrace at the completion of their journey they are found on the high plateau which was originally and for the others the beginning of the journey Tertiary Man Another step in the science of prehistoric anthropology whether forward or back ward is yet to be determined was the discovery of implements and objects of supposed human origin or which bore a supposed artificial character alleged to be evidence of mans existence in the ter tiary period The first report in this di rection was by Mons J Desnoyers who on June 8 1863 presented before the Academy of Sciences at Paris certain fossil animal bones and pieces of wood from the quarries of sand and gravel at Saint Prest near Chartres France which were believed to belong to the pliocene formation whose marks imprints and strie were such as could have been made by man and were therefore said to be evidence pointing towards his existence in that period In 1867 the Second Congress of Archeology and Prehistoric Anthropology met at Paris and was largely occupied over a presenta tion of and discussion upon the evidences of tertiary man Mons LAbb6 Bourgeois presented a series of flint objects which were so chipped or broken as to appear to have been done by man Other objects were presented by various persons all al leged to have a bearing upon the main question and tending to establish the exist ence of man in the tertiary period These were of different materials bones cut or marked teeth or bones drilled wood and bone carved or gnawed etc until a rather 594 SCIENCOCTOBER 27 1899 extensive series of objects was gathered and which if their finders could have success fully maintained would have gone far toward the establishment of the existence of man in the tertiary period Professor Capellini found the fossil rib bones of a whale in the tertiary deposit at MonteAperto Italy These ribs had evi dently been cut with a sharp knife or tool and might easily have been done by man There was no attempt at engraving only certain kerfs across the ribs Professor Capellini presented his discovery to the Academy of Lincei at Rome and before the Congresses of Archeology and Prehistoric Anthropology at Budapest in 1876 and at Paris in 1878 I had the pleasure of exam ining these specimens in the Museum of the University of Bologna and was much im pressed with the contention of Professor Capellini Dr Arturo Issel one of the leading scien tists of Genoa joined the advocates of ter tiary man before the International Congress of Archeology and Prehistoric Anthropol ogy in 1867 by the presentation of a human skeleton or a portion of one found at a depth of ten feet in the blue clay said to have been of pliocene formation near Sa vona Italy The skeleton was discovered by other persons and had been distributed and portions lost so that only certain mem bers came to Dr Issel There were no other animal bones found in the deposit but many fossil shells which undoubtedly belonged to the pliocene If the skeleton was contemporaneous with the original de posit it would be good evidence of the exist ence of man during that period Four human skeletons were found at Castene dolo Italy by Professor Ragazzoni then searching for fossil shells The deposit was determined to belong to the pliocene or at least to the tertiary There were throughout western Europe perhaps a dozen more instances of objects alleged to be human or related to human found in tertiary deposits The principal of these and that which obtained the greatest prominence was the discovery of Abbe Bourgeois at Thenay near Pontlevoy LoireetCher Among other reasons for the prominence of the discovery of Abb6 Bourgeois was the fact that the discov ery was near his own residence where he could give it much of his personal at tention and he was able to attend many or all of the scientific meetings whether of archeology geology or paleontologywherein the subject would find interested auditors with many opportunities for the presenta tion of the subject From the year 1867 when his discovery was presented to the International Congress of Archeology and Prehistoric Anthropology at Paris until 1883 before the Association Frangaise at Blois he kept up an aggressive warfare The deposit at Thenay was agreed to be long to the tertiary and it had not beep disturbed therefore if the objects were made by man they would be evidence of his existence at the time the deposit was made They were all of flint and had evi dently been worked whether naturally or artifically was the important question Some had been crackled as though by fire and others had been chipped as though by man I have three of these pieces of flint in the Museum at Washington and am free to confess that had they been found under conditions ordinarily possible to pre historic man I should have no hesitation in accepting them as artificial The presenta tion of these flint objects before the various archeological Congresses created great in terest and begat much discussion At one that in Brussels an international committee of fifteen members was appointed to inves tigate the question and make report The committee divided as might have been ex pected Eight members were of opinion that the pieces of flint were artifically SCIENCE 595596 SCIENCE chipped DeQuatrefages CapelliniWorsaae Englehardt Augustus W Franks Valdemir Schmidt DOmalius and Cartailhac  five members were opposed Steenstrup Desor Neirynck and Fraas Marquis de Vibray was favorable but with reserve and Van Beneden unable to decide It will thus be perceived that the ques tion was difficult to determine and much could be said on both sides If the oppos ing forces of learned men who on the ground marching in the presence of each other and of the objects themselves and as at Blois with the deposit whence the objects came under their eyes were still unable to determine the question it would be venturesome for us to attempt it Since the meeting at Blois there has been but little discussion of the flints from Thenay It would seem as though neither party was convinced by the other and both were con tent to maintain their former opinions and cease the discussion Sir John Evans re vived it after a fashion in his presidential address before the British Association at Leeds in 1890 wherein he took opposite grounds Discoveries similar to that of the Abbe Bourgeois were made by M B Rames a distinguished geologist of Aurillac at a lo cality called Puy Courny near Aurillac by Charles Ribeiro near Lisbon Portugal and by Joseph Bellucci of Perugia at Otta Mon teredondo Italy They all fall into the fame category and received the same treat ment In the conclusion to be awarded to the existence of man during the tertiary period they stand or fall together PithecanthropusDubois The presentation of this branch of my subject would be incomplete without a reference to the great discovery made by Dr Dubois at Tinil Java Dr Dubois is  Mons Cartailac changed his opinion ut not until several years afterward N S VOL X No 252 an educated physician a graduate of the Leyden TUniversity interested in prehistoric anthropology with a sufficient knowledge of geology and paleontology to enable him make satisfactory investigations in the field He was attached to the Dutch army as a medicalofficer and with it sent to Java He lived there for six years and having found a deposit of fossil bones at Tinil prosecuted his researches therein for three summers with great success During this work he found certain portions of a skeleton which if not human was nearer it than was any other Dr Dubois has published a preliminary report of his dis covery containing a section and plan of the field of his explorations and photo graphic copies of the human  remains When this publication appeared and fell into the hands of the physical anthropolo gists whether of Europe or of America who by their knowledge of human and comparative anatomy were the best quali fied to judge they almost universally set tled the question to their own satisfaction in the shortest and easiest way by the de cision that the remains were human and that Dr Dubois had done nothing more than discover an ancient graveyard There were few persons in the United States pre pared to combat this view Professor O C Marsh visited Leyden in attendance upon theInternational Congress of Zoology September 1895 and upon his return an nounced that this was a much graver ques tion than had before been recognized I had the gratification of visiting Dr Dubois and seeing his collection Like Professor Marsh I was amazed at the showing made He had in his laboratory many thousand pieces of bones from the deposit at Tinil They were all fossilized their weight was greatly increased and their color much darkened while the human  bones had an identical appearance and it was evident that they came from theSCIENCE same deposit and were the same age It is the accepted conclusion on every hand that the bones and deposits belonged to the ter tiary period what particular epoch I am not prepared to say The dilemma presented by the discovery of Dr Dubois in relation to the antiquity of man is that if the bones are really those of a human individual it carries the an tiquity of the human species back to the tertiary period If the individual is not human because the deposit of the tertiary period is too early then he must have been the precursor of man and so the missing link This dilemma must be recognized and the conclusion made harmonious Darwin would have accepted this as a rep resentative specimen of his missing link De Mortillet was of opinion that the animal that chipped the flints of Thenay was not man but his precursor which he named 4Anthropopitheque or Anthropopithecus Dr Dubois has the same idea or theory with regard to the man of his discovery and he has given it the name Pithecan thropus erectus The discussion over ter tiary man or mans precursor remains in abeyance Each of the two parties holds to his respective opinions pro and con and the question awaits further developments Neolithic and Bronze Ages Continuous If there was a belief in an hiatus be tween the Paleolithic and the Neolithic ages of Europe there was no belief in an hiatus between the Neolithic period and the age of Bronze It seems conceded that there was no appreciable difference in the races of people in western Europe in these two ages It is also conceded that the stage of culture continued in both practi cally the same that all or most of the industries of the Neolithic period were continued into the Bronze age subject how ever to the natural improvement which came with added experience The differ 597 ence between the two ages then was the increased facility in performing the function of civilization by reason of having cutting implements of bronze instead of those of stone The making of bronze was evidently a human invention and has little or nothing to do with a difference in race nor beyond the benefit or improvement made by the invention has it much to do with a change in culture Copper was easily procured throughout Europe and implements of that metal were made in neolithic times and doubtless con tinued to be made in the Bronze age But the advent of bronze was a totally different affair Copper did not require casting it might have been hammered into the desired form and so made into implements but the knowledge of melting and casting was in dispensable to the age of Bronze Bronze is a mixture of copper and tin in the pro portion of eight or nine parts of the former to one of the latter The question whence came the bronze which was so plentiful throughout Europe has always been one of the problems of prehistoric archeology The tin necessary for making bronze ap pears to have come from the country around the Straits of Malacca The methods of its migration or transportation to Europe whether the tin was brought over whether it was melted mixed with copper and then brought over both being in the form of in gots or whether it was cast into implements and then distributed are facts absolutely unknown and they probably will always remain so Prehistoric bronze objects have been found in southern Asia and through out Europe The excavations of Dr Schlie mann into the Hill of Hissarlik brought many of them to light Foundries have been discovered in most European coun tries in France nigh a hundred the latest by Mons Paul du Chatelier in Brittany The most extensive one yet found was that at Bologna Italy It contained the metal OCTOBER 27 1898N S VOL X No 252 in all stages of preparation for casting to gether with molds and crucibles ready for use There were 14000 fourteen thou sand pieces of bronze some in ingots but most of it in wornout implements broken into small pieces suitable for the melting pot Epochs of culture in the age of Bronze have been manifested by improvements in style in the hatchets of Southern Europe and the fibulae of Scandinavia Physical Anthropology Physical Anthropology which includes Somatology and Physiology has received considerable attention at the hands of some of the European anthropologists Naturally these sciences are studied at immense disad vantage when confined to prehistoric man therefore it has been extended to include savage peoples and many of the most ar dent anthropologists of Europe have studied the somatology and physiology of the sav age in the endeavor to obtain even reflected light or knowledge in regard to prehistoric man There had been a number of skele tons of prehistoric man found throughout western Europe The instances are rare and isolated where specimens have been found of paleolithic man The evidence has not always been harmonious nor has it always pointed in one direction The Neanderthal skull has been assumed as the representative of the oldest race Probably a dozen other specimens of human skele tons or fragments thereof have been found all of which are claimed to have belonged to paleolithic man The following are the best known Constadt 1700 Lahr 1823 Engis 1833 Denise 1844 Neanderthal 1856 Olmo 1863 Naulette Furfooz Sol utr6 CroMagnon Engischeim Savona 1865 Aurignac Laugerie Brux 1872 Men tone 187275 Spy 1886 Those of the Grotto of Spy in Belgium are the best iden tified and authenticated The conclusions to be ventured are that paleolithic man had a dolichocephalic skull with prominent frontal sinuses he was short in stature but had heavy bones with strong muscular attachments He was prognathous with large and strong pro jecting teeth which were unusually sound He had habitually three molar teeth His legs were crooked and it has been doubted whether he regularly assumed an upright position The human remains found in the caverns still paleolithic but of the later epochs indi cate an increase in height size and sym metry It has been supposed from com parison of osteologic evidence from the caverns notably with the CroMagnon skele ton that the Berbers of North Africa and the Guanches of the Canary Islands repre sent a similar ethnic type The neolithic man had a skull more brachycephalic He was not so prognath ous as was paleolithic man his forehead was higher and squarer and his brain ca pacity greater his teeth were less projecting and not so large as those of paleolithic man The conditions of human burials in prehis toric times were not advantageous for the present study of the somatology of the in dividual The paleolithic man rarely bur ied his dead and when he did the preserva tion and discovery of the skeletons have been largely accidental The neolithic man buried his dead in great ossuaries and fre quently if not always subjected the in dividual to a second burial after the integu ments had disappeared The immediate and direct result is that modern discoveries of these ossuaries find the bones pellmell and we are unable to identify those of in dividuals Classification of Raees Unable to obtain sufficient specimens to enable them to master the science in its re lation to prehistoric man the students of 598 SCIENCEOCTOBER 27 1899 somatology have as already suggested ex tended their investigations to modern peo ples primitive and savage hoping for two results one incidentally a knowledge of these peoples per se and the other to obtain by comparison a better knowledge of pre historic peoples This investigation in duced classification of races which have run into infinitesimal details There has been much striving among an thropologists for a satisfactory classifica tion of the human race The item in this classification which seems to have been re ceived with most favor is determined by the cephalic index This is the ratio be tween the extreme length of the skull as compared with the extreme breadth and this compared with the extreme height Various subdivisions have been made and various names given dolichocephalic the longheaded mesocephalic medium and brachycephalic shortheaded Other schemes are according to the character of the hair running through lophocomi tufted eriocomi fleecy euplocomi curly and euthycomi straight Still another classi fication was that of the dental index by Professor W H Flower the microdont the lowest index mesodont medium and megadont the highest dental index The earliest and possibly original scheme of classification of the human races was according to color the yellow whiteblack to which were afterwards added the brown and the red Probably these stand the test of experience in science about as well as the more complicated classifications Dr Topinard has undertaken an investi gation among the people of France by which he is to determine the color of the hair and eyes segregated according to dif ferent departments Virchow has done the same among the schoolchildren of Ger many and in a late work Dr W Z Ripley of Columbia University New York has re ported and published sundry investigations in some of the countries of western Europe classifying and separating the peoples ac cording to color of skin hair and eyes of the cephalic index of height and other physical characteristics Such a work as his applied to the native races of America would be new and original and a valuable contribution to the science of anthropology Dr Washington Matthews made such an investigation of the early occupants of the Salado Valley Arizona Darwins discovery of the origin of the human species by evolution from lower forms of animals created an interest in the antiquity of man different from that of archeology It required a knowledge of zoology and of human and comparative anatomy and involved a study of anthro pology in its subdivisions of somatology physiology and psychology involving the physical and intellectual characteristics of man Based upon this necessity the various schools and societies of anthropology were organized in many of the great cities of the world notably Paris London and Berlin The organization of these societies and the investigations involved brought to the front a set of scientists totally different from those who had before been studying archeology Broca in Paris stood near the head of these followed by Manouvrier and Topi nard Gosse in Geneva Huxley and Tylor Biddoe and Keane in England Virchow and Bastian and Meyer in Germany with Mantegazza and Sergi in Italy The family Bertillon consisting of the father now dead and his two sons successors were the discoverers and inventors of the science of anthropometry in its adaptation to prehistoric man The races of men had been studied before and the general divis ions were those of color Anthropometry gave an additional interest to this branch of the science and it ran riot making sub divisions on the bases of infinitesimal de tails This was pressed to such a point SCIENCE 599N S VOL X No 252 that one ardent investigator found sufficient difference in the human species as that he subdivided it into 172 races Anthropology the Science of Man Anthropology was defined to be the science of man and included everything relating to man his physical intellectual psychologic characteristics and these ex tended through all ramifications Subdivisions of Anthropology Some scientists chiefly the French have proposed to confine the term Anthro pology  to the physical structure but it is deemed better to include within it every thing pertaining to man making the various subdivisions as represented by the minor sciences even though they might be treated independently The following is little more than suggestive Biology and comparative anatomy Human anatomy Anthropometry craniometry Comparative psychology Literature 1 a n g u a g e written

Society of Anthropology of Paris as set forth in the course of lectures given by its professors during the present year are as follows Prehistoric Anthropology Anthropometry and Embryology Ethnology Biology Lang uage and Ethnography Sociology history of civilization Zoologic Anthropology Geographic Anthropology Physical Anthro pology The Society might not accept the forego ing as a correct or complete subdivision of the science Other branches may be added on the employment of more professors The Society of Anthropology at Washing ton has during the past year made the fol lowing rearrangement of sections according to what was deemed proper in matter and terminology  Section A Somatology 4 B Psychology a C Esthetology D Technology E Sociology F Philology  G Sophiology It will be understood from the foregoing that the subdivisions cannot be made on hard and fast lines but are susceptible of infinite changes and varieties It would be scarcely possible for any one to master all these sciences and so become a perfected and allround anthropologist Classifica tion however is largely a matter of defini tion the material facts remain the same The field of any particular science is well understood whatever name may be given or to whatever classification it may belong and it is not worth while to engage in ex tensive discussion of any particular classifi cation or the nomenclature or terminology of any of these sciences It is deemed more satisfactory to group them all under the generic name of Anthropology This plan has been pursued generally in the Societies of Anthropology and in the edu 600 S CENCEOCTOBER 27 1899 cational organizations where it is pretended to be taught United States It is my duty on this occasion to give some expression to this subject in its rela tion to America or to the Western Hemis phere The length of this address precludes an exhaustive examination The student or reader might before proceeding furtherread the address delivered before this Section the first by Dr Daniel G Brinton at New York in 1887 the title being A Review of the Data for the Study of the Prehistoric Chro nology of America  and the second that of Dr C C Abbott at Cleveland in 1898 the title being Evidence of the Antiquity of Man in Eastern North America The conditions under which the begin nings of our knowledge of prehistoric man were made were quite different in America from those of Europe In western Europe thehistoric period began with the invasion of Caesar fifty or more years before the Chris tian era and the prehistoric period with which we have had to deal came to a close about that time On the contrary in America the prehis toric period continued until the discovery of the country by Columbus and its subse quent occupation by the white man who was thus brought face to face with the pre historic man The superstitions myths and folklore concerning stone hatchets and flint arrow heads so prevalent in western Europe had no place in America It was useless to talk to the white man of the heavenly origin of the stone hatchet or the flint arrow head when he knew by the evi dence of his own senses that these were the implements and weapons of the prehis toric savage with which he had to deal THOMAS WILSON U S NATIONAL MUSEUM To be concluded  Died at Atlantic City July 30 1899 Resolutions of condolence were adopted by Section H at the meet ing after the delivery of this address CHEMISTRY AT THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATIONt FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE As has been the custom for several years the American Chemical Society united with the Section in its meetings the program on Monday and Tuesday being in charge of the Society and on the other days in charge of the Section This has resulted very favorably to both parties and never more s6 than this year when over fifty papers were on the program and the attendance of chemists has been only once if ever sur passed The address of the VicePresident Dr F P Venable on The Definition of the Element has already been published in this JOURNAL On Monday morning after the adjourn ment of the general session of the Associa tion several reports of committees were read The most important was that of the Committee of the Chemical Society on Coal Analysis This was presented by W A Noyes the chairman of the committee and was the final report and took up chiefly the matters of sampling and of moisture Much discussion was elicited The reading of papers began on Monday afternoon and continued until Thursday afternoon when the Section adjourned A number of the papers read presented special interest in the field of inorganic chemistry One of these was by W R Whitney on the nature of the change in chromium salts from violet to green on heating It has of late been quite generally recognized that the chromium salt say the sulfate is decomposed on heating its solu tion into free acid and a more basic salt The hitherto unsolved problem has been to determine the amount of free acid formed This Mr Whitney solved in a very inge nious manner By enclosing the salt be tween gelatine walls in a Utube the acid is made to diffuse under the influence of an electric current completely into the jelly SCIENCE 601

means to turn their attention to astronomical researches of real scientific utility special attention being directed to the comparatively new fields of spectroscopy and celestial photography The book will be pub lished by Messrs Longmlans  Co Mr Oliver in the mean time invites suggestions from prac tical workers which may be sent to him at Loch winnoch Scotland   The weather journal Cincinnati S S Bass ler is the title of a new weekly paper to be de voted to the general meteorology of the eastern United States illustrated by tridaily charts of the movements of the atmosphere and the distri bution of atmospheric pressure and temperature  The wealth and richness of the illustrations of Mr I C Russells Recent glaciers of the United States Fifth annual report U S geol surv would alone give his work value but they serve only to embellish what without them is a very interesting treatise Some of the engravings of Mounts Shasta and Dana are especially strik ing One is surprised to learn of the extent to which glaciers occur in the United States through out the northern Sierra Nevada and Rocky moun tains while in the Cascade Mountains are numer ous ones flowing through narrow defiles and over precipices and as the author says by no means unworthy of comparison with the icefields of Switzerland and Scandinavia In Alaska the catalogue is still further extended embracing numerous examples of alpine glaciers as magnifi cent as any in the world  Professor Chamberlins paper in the Fifth annual report of the U S geological survey on artesian wells is one that cannot help but be of practical value It was the authors aim to in clude in convenient form such information rela tive to the qualifying conditions of artesian wells as may be capable of brief general statement and may seem to be serviceable alike to citizen driller and geologist and he has evidently suc ceeded Some novel and interesting applications of instantaneous photography to the study of the movements of the heart and intestines have re cently been made by Dr WV G Thompson Photographs of rabbits pigeons cats and frogs hearts were made in different stages of systole and diastole showing the action more clearly and ac curately than is possible by other methods In addition to the value of such in physiological teaching the most practical application of the VOL VII No 163 method will be the illustration of the changes in the form of the heart and intestines produced by drugs and the author believes the process may be fulrther extended to the study of the contrac tions of the stomach bladder and diaphragm and other viscera LETTERS TO THE EDITOR  Correspondents are requested to be as brief as possible The writers name is in all cases required as proof of good faith The trade in spurious Mexican antiquities A NOTE supplementary to my paper on Mexican pottery published in your issue of Feb 19 may be of interest to a number of readers The fradulent specimens referred to reach this country in two ways  through the agency of travellers who purchased them in Mexico and through traders who ship them to New York in large lots From recent observations I have reached the conclusion that there are now in the collections of this country specimens valued at many thousands of dollars yet which since they are fraudulent and in every way vicious are not worth the trouble of breaking up and casting away Peru is hardly less fully represented as the factories in that country have been at work for a number of years The detection of modern work is in many cases a difficult matter but in others a decision is easily reached With reference to the Peruvian frauds it may be taken for granted that newlooking speci mens are new and besides that many oldappear ing pieces are new If exterior appearances are not sufficient to satisfy the collector as to the age of suspected pieces let him break some very narrow neckedvessel either of the light terracotta colored or of the black ware and he will probably find that the inside is innocent of any stain of age I may add that objects of stone from both of these countries need careful inspection Washington DC W H HOLMES The anachronisms of pictures The articles of Professors Ilolder and Lockwood Science vii 220 and 242 remind me of what I saw many years ago in one of the ladies magazines  a picture of the embarkation of the Pilgrims from Delft Haven with steamships at anchor in the bay An enterprising artist only about two hundred years ahead of his time and the picture probably drawn by our artist on the spot C G Homer NY Is the dodo an extinct bird  It is very improbable that the dodo has been found in the Samoan Islands alive or fossil It inhabited the islands of Mauritius and Bourbon in the Indian Ocean The bird alluded to by Mr Hopkins as still living in Samoa is probably the Didunculus a speci men of which I well remember in the collection of Sir William Jardine the famous ornithologist Sir William thought the Didunculus was allied to the dodo and the pigeon W S SYMONDS The camp Sunningdale Feb 29

Charlottesville Va One of the most important of the transformation groups that occur in the Theory of Differential Equations or in Geometry is the socalled group of Euclidian Movements We propose to investigate the form of the most gen eral transformation of this group in the plane and in space 1 The infinitesimal transformations of the group of movements in the plane are writing p for f and q for Lf I p q yp  q the first two being the translations and the third the rotation The most gen eral infinitesimal transformation of this G3 or threefold group has the form Uf  Ap  Bg  C yp  xq A B C consts and since Uf and condt Uf may be considered as equivalent infinitesimal transformations there are clearly Xo2 infinitesimal transformations in all in this G3 We know that points which are absolutely invariant under the trans formation UfA  Cyp  B  Cxeq are obtained by writing A Cy O BCx  70t Hence the only invariant point within a finite distance of the origin is B A x  X  C In order to find the simplest form for the general infinitesimal transforma tion of the G3 when the variables are referred to rectangular axes let us trans form the origin to the point B  A by introducing the new variables   A X  Y Y C88 PAGE THE GENERAL TRANSFORMATION OF We may assume C t 0 otherwise Uf would be a mere translation hence in the new variables Uf becomes Uf UUx   U  ay Of  Ux P  Uy A  Cy Of  B Cx Of LC rX aLf y J or as we may write it Uj f OtfX Of Hence we see that by a proper choice of the rectangular coordinate axes the most general transformation of the Gh of mnovements in the plane may be written in the formn of a mere rotation The pathcurves of Uf are given by dX dy and hence they have the form X2  y  c2  c const so that the pathcurves of Uf are given by Fx g 2 FA AC22 Since the finite equations of any transformation Uf X y f a Xic y Of are obtained by integrating the simultaneous system dx  dy  dt T v it is clear that when the equation dx dy T I has been integrated the finite equations of the infinitesimal transformationTHE GROUP OF EUCLIDIAN MOVEMENTS 89 may be obtained by a quadrature Hence the finite equations of the trans formation Uf A  Cy G f  BCx f may now be obtained by a quadrature If we indicate the extended transformation corresponding to Uf by If x y p  C x y q   a y y q    yn  y y yn q 1 where y Fe and q ay  the Differential Invariant8 of the transformation Uf may be found by inte grating the simultaneous system dx dy dy dy n we    t   tn Prof Lie has shown that when we know the pathcurves of the trans formation i e when the equation dx dy has been integrated the other integralfunctions of the simultaneous system may be found by one quadrature and a finite number of differentiations Thus we may consider the Differential Invariants of the transformation U A  Byp  B x q to be all known and from this it follows that the whole Theory of Invariance of the G3 of movements in the plane including the theory of the congruence of plane curves may be derived by operations which do not involve any further integration This theory has been worked out in detail by Prof Liet in a different manner These results are very simple for the case considered above but they are given here merely to indicate the manner in which such questions are to be treated  Compare  Pages Differential Equations p 69 t  Continuirliche Gruppen Chap 2290 PAGE THE GENERAL TRANSFORMATION OF  2 The group of movements in space consists of the six infinitesimal trans formations p q r yp q zq yr xr zp the first three being the translations and the other three the rotations The most general infinitesimal transformation of the G6 has the form UjA1p 4 Bq  Cr  Dyp xq  Ezq yr  Fxr zp A B  Fconsts Since Uf and p Uf where p const are equivalent infinitesimal transforma tions we may choose the above transformation in the form p Uf where 1  1D2  4E2d F2 It is clear that this is equivalent to considering the constants D E F to be connected by the relation D2IE22F2l 1 and the reason for this assumption will appear from the sequel We may write Uf in the form UfA  Dy  Fz p  B Dx  Ez q  C Ey  E r and any invariant points or curves consisting of absolutely invariant points are obtained by writing A  Dy  z 0 B Dx  Ez  X 2 C 1y  Fr O0 J Multiplying these equations in order by F F D and adding we have AE J BF CD   3 Since A B  F are undetermined constants except for the relation 1 3 will usually not be a true equation We shall however divide our problem into two parts by assuming first that 3 holds and secondly that 3 does not hold I We assume that the constants A B  F have been chosen in such manner that AE4BF4CD0 3THE GROUP OF EUCLIDIAN MOVEMENTS 91 It is then clear that the equations 2 are not independent  and hence any two of them say F2 Egy  C 0 4 Dx  Ez  B  0 determine a straight line which is invariant under Uf in such manner that each point on the line is separately invariant Tile line 4 cuts the xyplane at the point BID A19 D  0 and we choose this point as the origin by writing x xBID yyAID Z Z The line 4 then becomes K  Ey 0 5 Dx  Ez  0 while Uf assumes the form Uf Ux22  Uy Of  U Z Uj   Uy Z   ZC A  BDyE  sf  BD x E  erz ofCEy y Fx Dy  Fz  Ez Dx  Fx Ey Of This transformation is now made up of the three rotations and it was geo metrically clear a priori that the three translations must disappear when the line 4 is invariant since they leave no point within a finite distance of the origin invariant We shall now choose the invariant line 5 as the zaxis This line is also represented by the equations Fe  Ey  0 FxEyV  E2  2 which may be written SAxl  y O 0 692 PAGE THE GENERAL TRANSFORMATION OF The planes represented by 6 are now perpendicular and a third plane through the origin perpendicular to these two is given by Ex  Fy  Da  0 Let us now introduce new variables by writing XFx Ey YEDx  FDy E2  F2Z Z  Ex  Fy  Dz We then have UX  Y UY  E2  F2  D2X UZ   or on account of 1 Uf I X CY  U  Y lf  U Z Y OfX Of We see that this is an infinitesimal rotation in the variables X Y Z Hence when the relation 3 exists the most general movement possible in space is a rotation Geometrically this was a priori evident for when a straight line consisting of invariant points is invariant it is clear that the only movement possible for the other points in space is a rotation around the invariant line II Let us now suppose that no relation of the form AE  BF  CD 0 exists As in the last case let us transform the origin to the point BD A D by writing B A X  D D t  y  D 2 Z D t  The transformation Uf becomes Uf  Dy  a  E Dx t  Fx  Fy  x Of x E D where AEp BLWDC Now introduce the new independent variables A Y Z by means of XFxp  Ey  x YEDx  FDy  KE2  JI2 Z Z Ex  F I DzTHE GROUP OF EUCLIDIAN MOVEMENTS 93 and we find UJfUX Lf  UY F Uzf  Wf X XD2f  DX ait Finally introduce as new variables x2 Y1 z2 by means of x1 X XD2 y  y Z2  ZDx P tO Hence the transformation assumes the form UfuY1 Fij   y 2 Hence the mo8t general transformation of the group of movement8 in space UfzA  DyFzp  BD  Ezq C0 Ey Fxr where the constants satisfy the relation F2  F2  D2 1 may by a proper choice of rectangular axe8 be written in the canonical form U7fyp  wq  r This transformation is evidently made up of a rotation around the zaxis combined with a translation along that axis i e all the points in space move on helixes wound upon right cylinders of which the zaxis is the axis Hence we have a result well known in kinematics that the mo8t general movement oj a point in space i8 equivalent to a movement of that point on a helix The aggregate of the transformations performed above upon UJ is clearly represented by  p BE y  A1  X1 D2 yEs   IE2  F2 7 z2  E X Ixj  F y I I  Dz Dx and these equations enable us to pass from the first form of tlhe infinitesimal transformation to the last at one step In the form f7 ypI  qI  r194 PAGE THE GENERAL TRANSFORMATION ETC it is obvious that the pathcurves of the transformation are helixes and they are given by the integrals of the simultaneous system da  dy  dzI Y I  1 in the form X12  Y12 c2 tanl1 X z1  c2 8 In order to obtain the pathcurves of the transformation in its original form we only need substitute in 8 the values of al yl zl given by 7 Since Uj f leaves the straight line ah y  0 invariant while the points on this line are interchanged among each other it is clear that the original transformation always leaves the straight line F BD  E y  A  x 1D2  l L J EDxBD  FDy  AD  E2 F2z 0 similarly invariant and it is geometrically evident a priori that since the most general infinitesimal movement must always leave a straight line invari ant the most general movement to which a point of general position of space can be subjected is a movement on a helix It is clear that we may now obtain the finite equations of the original transformation by a quadrature We know the Invariants 8 of the trans formation and if we extend the transformation under the hypothesis that x y and z are connected by a relation of the form z f x y we may according to a theorem of Lie find all the Differential Invariants of the G6 of movements of the form Q X y a pq  r 8 and establish the theory of the congruence of surfaces in space without fur ther integration and a similar remark is true of curves i e when x y z are connected by the relations z P  Y  x These theories have been developed by Lie in detail from another standpoint

there can be no reasonable doubt of their reality as the result of the explosion A second and still more violent commotion was observed 10 or 15 seconds later and a third even greater disturbance occurred about the same length of time following the second At 111815 A M the entire surface of the mercury under the objective appeared to sway back and forth over a space certainly as great as one five hundredth of an inch This action continued eight or ten seconds and at the end of about 20 seconds there was almost an entire subsidence of the commotion From this instant the recurring disturbances gradually diminished and at 1120 A Mi they had entirely ceased At this time the ice wagon was directly opposite the observatory The waves of disturbance certainly increased in amplitude until 111815 A M and gradually di minished after that time The intervals between the waves appeared to be about 15 seconds but attention was not withdrawn to the chronometer to be accurate as to this Professor Rogers is not quite certain whether there were three or four waves preceding the one having the greatest am plitude The direction of the waves as indicated by the movement of the spot reflected on the mercury surface was certainly not due east and west but rather about 15 degrees from the north and south line that is north of east and south of west On the next following day by prearrangement with the driver an ice wagon was started from about opposite the observatory to be driven rapidly away Under these circumstances only a very slight tremor of the mercury surface was visible while the cart was traversing a distance of about 750 feet after which the tremor ceased The readings of the chronometer were corrected to give eastern time as above stated SOCIAL PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION OF COMTE THIS is one of the ablest works of the wellknown author and is a decidedly agreeable indication of the spirit just now prevalent in the better sort of philosophical discussion When the British Hegelian movement began a score of years ago with Dr Stirlings  Secret of Hegel it was on its face an intolerant and exclusive movement As popular English thought had no organ for under standing the master and merely felt that Dr Stirling had kept his secret so the Hegelian leader himself expressed a bitter contempt for popular English thought and mutual advantage The social philosophy and religion of Comte By ED WAED CLIRD LLD iNew York dactillat 1855 7 YCGE VOL VI No 142 for the disputants seemed hopeless The new Hegelianism looked like a new patent plan of sal vation with nothing to offer save to the faithful Younger Hegelians in the British universities equally learned in their chosen field but less vain of their skill have changed in latter days this for bidding exclusiveness They have seen that a doctrine which pretends to be universal cannot possibly be content with a merely scholastic intole rance and formalism They have felt that if Hegelianism is of universal significance for human thought it can be so only in case universal human thought is already in its actual essence Hegelian however unconscious the natural man may be of his discipleship A system is of one sort when it says  I express what you heretics shall become ere you shall escape from your natural and utterly lost state  and of quite another sort when it says  I express what you as genuine human thinkers already in your thought unwittingly are and aim to be Now if there is any truth essential to genuine Hegelianism it is that this latter attitude is the correct one towards the thought of any active and sincerely progressive age like the pres ent The Hegelian system pretends to have mean ing only for an actual concrete world and loses sense whenever it is presented as a remote plan of a purely abstract and ideal world And so the healthy effort of the younger British Hegelians to drop Dr Stirlings  headboy airs to cease boast ing of the skill required for seeing through the Hegelian millstone and to tell us a straight story about what human thought is and does is an effort of a most gratifying sort To be sure this effort must not be confounded with any debased popularizing of philosophical study such as should overcome difficulties only by keeping them below the horizon The more recent British He gelian books and articles are not very easy read ing But they have a most stimulating air of actuality about them and if Prof Caird is not always so robust and direct in speech as some of his fellows he at least shows a very sincere effort to continue his studious progress earthwards and we may hope that he will ere long reach his goal This undertaking then to show not that human thought must needs put on the Spanish boots of any mans terminology but that the Hegelian doctrine has expressed profound truths about the unconscious spirit and about the true mean ing and work of all sound natural thought is ex emplified by Prof Caird in the volume before us by an application of his method to a criticism of Auguste Comte Comte is one would have sup posed at the other pole from Hegel One would be amused to imagine them in Walter Savage Landor fashion engaged in conversation or betterSCIENCE in Hades like two characters in Luciai possibly talking about this very book of Cairds and vainly trying with the tolerance suitable to disembodied spirits to find out each what the other might be in the universe to do They would hardly suc ceed so well as in this book Prof Caird has suc ceeded for them He has seen their close spiritual relationship and has shown how much Comtes aim was like Hegels If in doing this he has rather delighted in reducing Comte to Eegel than in trying to read Hegel in terms of Colmte the in justice if it be such is one natural to a disciples nature and also a necessary result of the fact that he has applied his criticism mainly to Comtes social philosophy An equally thoughtful and tolerant Comtian critic coming from his side with corresponding motives to the study of Hegels naturphilosophie would probably find no great difficulty in reducing whatever is significant in this part of Hegel to the terminology and to the thought of Comte But Prof Caird is surely right in taking these two great thinkers to be expressions unconsciously analogous of the same great tendency They both summed up the age of the reaction Tn the temperaments of both smouldered the same re pressed romantic fire which each of them scorned in others and could not destroy in himself In each this same natural and suppressed sympathy with the romantic movement gave color to his results each struggled with his temperament and in each this struggle became his system For philosophical systems like all other products of devoted lives are the results of inner personal conflicts of character Hegel and Conmte differed as Swabian from Frenchman but their problems were much the same and their results profoundly similar beneath all the great external differences Hence the concrete psychological interest of a book like the present There is no space here to go into the details of Prof Cairds discussion The book begins by pointing out the main elements both in the scien tific and in the social philosophy of Comte This part of the work is on the whole done very appre ciatively Then in chapter ii Prof Caird begins his criticisms Yet these criticisms are never merely destructive The deeper sense of the doc trine is sought and Prof Caird easily finds some times perhaps too easily that where Comte was true to himself and to his problems he was true also to essentially Hegelian principles That Comte for instance in his hatred for what he called metaphysics stood in fact unconsciously on Kantian and so on the Hegelian ground is clear That when Comte after seeming to be a pure nominalist in his war with traditional relig 355 ion and metaphysics turns about and says  Man is a mere abstraction and there is nothing real but humanity he comes upon decidedly Hegelian ground  The defect says Prof Caird lies in the unconsciousness of his own metaphysic As chapter ii is devoted to the negative or destructive side of Comtes doctrine chapter iii discusses the positive or constructive side in cluding in this Comtes substitutes for meta physic and theology Toward the end of the book in chapter iv on Comtes view of the relation of the intellect to the heart Prof Caird seems to us to take his task too easily and to con tent himself too frequently with inspiring but de cidedly dark sayings But here very possibly our failure to follow may be a matter of our own weakness in Prof Cairds faith Prof Cairds result assimilates very closely Comtes position in philosophy to that of Kant namely in so far as his thought was unconsciously a germ out of which a positive idealism would have to grow if it were developed Also partly because he lived at a later time and in the midst of a society which was in the throes of a social revolution and partly because of the keenness and strength of his own social sympathies he gives us a kind of insight into the diseases and wants of modern society which we could not expect from Kant and which throws new light upon the ethi cal speculations of Kants idealistic successors One has to believe thinks Prof Caird that his system is inconsistent with itself and that his historical and social theories are defective But one finds him well worthy of study Let us add that one does not need to be an Hegelian in order to appreciate the skill and toler ance of Prof Cairds book and to find much that is deeply interesting not only from a philosophic but also from a purely psychological point of view in this suggestion of strong mental and moral like ness under an external show of great diversity In this sense Prof Caird has made a most helpful contribution to what we much needa psychologi cal history of thought as a product of social and individual temperament RUSSIA UNDER THE TZARS READERS of  Underground Russia  are familiar with the great fortress of Peter and Paul famous as the place from which Krapotkine made his

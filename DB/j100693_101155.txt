J100693,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16651678,101155,AN EXTRACT OF A LETTER OF MR MARTIN LISTER CONCERNING THE FIRST PART OF HIS TABLES OF SNAILS TOGETHER WITH SOME QUAERES RELATING TO THOSE INSECTS AND THE TABLES THEMSELVES SENT TO THE PUBLISHER FROM YORK MARCH 12 1673,I206874,AN EXTRACT OF A LETTER OF MR MARTIN LISTER CONCERNING THE FIRST PART OF HIS TABLES OF SNAILS TOGETHER WITH SOME QUAERES RELA TING TO THOSE INSECTS AND THE TABLES THEMSELVES SENT TO THE PUB LISHER FROM YORK MARCH 12 1673 I HEREWITH SEND YOU THE FIRST PART OF OUR TABLES OF SNAILS AND SOME QUAERES UPON THAT SUBJECT ALSO THE LIVELY FIGURE OF EACH SHELL FOR ILLUSTRATION DONE BY MR LODGE I RESERVE BY ME THE SEASHELLS AND ROCKSTONES THAT PART I SEND YOU AT PRESENT BEING AT A STAND WITH ME THOSE OTHER INCREASE UPON MY HANDS DAILY WHICH THOUGH THAT BE NOT A SIGN OF PERFECTION FOR THERE IS UNDOUBTED WORK FOR MANY AGES YET IS OF GOOD ADVANCE MENT AND PROGRESS THIS OTHER OF THE COPIOUSNESS OF THE SUBJECT AGAIN IN THAT PART OF THE TABLES YOU HAVE FROM ME AUTHORS ARE VERY LITTLE CONCERND IN THE OTHER OF SEASHELLS AND STONELIKE SHELLS THERE ARE MANY AUTHORS WHICH ARE TO BE CONSULTED AND TAKEN IN IF POSSIBLE WE CAN UNDERSTAND THEM TREATING OF THE SAME SPECIES AS FOR ROCKSHELLS IN PARTICULAR THEY COME IN TO ME IN GREATER NUMBERS THAN I COULD EVER HAVE IMAGINED AND I CAN AS SURE97 SURE YOU THAT OF NEAR 30 SPECIES I HAVE NOW BY ME FOUND IN THIS COUNTY ALONE NOT ANY ONE CAN BE SAMPLED BY ANY SEA FRESKWATER OR LANDSNAIL THAT I HAVE OR EVER SAW SO THAT YOU SEE I HAVE STILL GOOD REASON TO DOUBT OF THEIR ORIGINAL BESIDES MANY OTHER ARGUMENTS THAT MY OBSERVATIONS ABOUT FOSSILS DO AFFORD AND WHICH YOU MAY POSSIBLY ONE DAY SEE AND THAT THERE ARE THE ELEGANT REPRESENTATIONS OF EVEN BI VALVESHELLS WHICH NEVER OWED THEIR ORIGINAL TO ANY ANIMAL I CAN DEMONSTRATE AND THINK NONE THAT HATH CONSIDERED THE THING WITH ME YET HATH DENYED OF WHICH HEREAFTER BUT WHETHER ALL BE SO OR NO I CHOOSE THIS METHOD AS THE MOST CONVINCING VIZ TO GIVE A COMPARATIVE VIEW SOME GENERAL QUAERES CONCERNING LAND AND FRESH WATER SNAILS 1 WHETHER THERE ARE OTHER SHELLSNAILS AT LAND THAN TUR BINATE 2 WHETHER THIS KIND OF INSECT ARE TRULY ANDROGYNA AND EQUALLY PARTICIPATE OF BOTH SEXES AS MR RAY FIRST OBSERVED AND WHETHER BOTH OF THEM TWO WHICH SHALL BE FOUND IN THE ACT OF VENERY DO ACCORDINGLY SPAWN OR LAY THOSE PERFECTLY ROUND AND CLEAR EGGS SO FREQUENTLY TO BE MET WITH IN THE SUR FACE OF THE EARTH AND IN THE WATER TOO AND THE CIRCUMSTAN CES OF THOSE EGGS HATCHING 3 WHETHER THE WAY OF FATTING SNAILS IN USE AMONGST THE ROMANS THAT IS TO MAKE LITTLE PAVED PLACES INCIRCLED WITH WATER BE NOT ALSO VERY EXPEDIENT IN ORDER TO THE TRUE NOTING THE MANNER OF THEIR GENERATION 4 WHAT LIGHT THE ANATOMY OF THIS KIND OF INSECT MAY GIVE TO THE REST 5 WHETHER THE BLACK SPOTS OBSERVABLE IN THE HORNS OF SOME SNAILS ARE EYES AS SOME AUTHORS AFFIRM AND NOT RATHER PARTS EQUIVALENT TO THE ANTENNAE OF OTHER INSECTS AS THE FLAT AND EX CEEDING THIN SHAPE ALSO THE BRANCHED HORNS IN OTHER SPECIES OF SNAILS SEEM TO CONFIRM 6 WHETHER THE COCCINEA SANIES WHICH SOME OF OUR WATER SNAILS FREELY AND PLENTIFULLY YIELD BE NOT A SALIVA RATHER THAN O AN98 AN EXTRAVASATED BLOOD THE LIKE MAY BE THOUGHT OF THE JUICE OF THE PURPLEFISH NOW OUT OF USE SINCE THE GREAT PLENTY OF COCHINEIL 7 IN WHAT SORT OF SNAILS ARE THE STONES MENTIONED BY THE ANCIENTS TO BE FOUND AND WHETHER THEY ARE NOT TO BE FOUND IN SUCH AS YIELD THEM AT CERTAIN TIMES OF THE YEAR AND WHETHER THEY ARE A CURE FOR A QUARTAN OR WHAT OTHER REAL VERTUE THEY HAVE 8 WHAT MEDICINAL VERTUES SNAILS MAY HAVE AS RESTORATIVE TO HECTIC PERSONS AND WHAT CREDIT THE ROMANS MAY DESERVE COUNTING THEM ESPECIALLY THE NECKS OF THEM HIGHLY VENEREAL CELSUS ALSO PARTICULARLY COMMENDING THEM TO BE BONI SUCCI AND STOMACHO APTAS 9 ALSO INQUIRE CONCERNING THE MACHANICAL USES OF THE SALI VA OF THESE ANIMALS AS IN DYING WHITENING OF WAX HAIR C NOTE THAT THE FIGURES ARE NUMBERED AND EXPLAINED BY THE TABLES THE FIGURES OF THE NAKED SNAILS ARE OMITTED IN THIS SPECIMEN BEING NOT MATERIAL TO THAT PART OF THE DESIGN WHICH IS WHEN THE OTHER PARTS OF THE TABLE ARE FINISHD TO GIVE THE

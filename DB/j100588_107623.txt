in the rates of Chronometers by the proximity of masses of iron By PETER BARLOW Esq of the Royal Military Academy Communicated by JoHi BARROw Esq F R S Read June 28 1821 JT having been ascertained during the voyage made by Captain BUCHAN to the Arctic regions in the year i818 that the rates of the chronometers were considerably different on board and on shore and this changhe having been attributed to the iron of the vessel I felt very dr irous first of ascer taining whether the proximity of a mass of iron had actually any effectin changing the rate and secoindly supposing this to be the case to determine if possible the laws and prin ciples by which that action was governed I accordingly through the kindness of some of my friends procured the loan of six excellent chronometers besides one or two others which upon trial were found to have too wide and irregular rates for my purpose Having procured these and made the requisite preparations I began my series of observations on them on the lith of March of the present year and continued them daily till the 25th of May when having obtained a considerable number of results they were discontinuedt It will however be propar before I proceed  See a Memoir by Mr FISHER who accompanied Captain BUCHAN in the Philosophical Transactions fori 18o Part I1 t 1 outght not to omit this opportunity of returning my best thanks to thos362 Mr BARLOw on the effects produced in the rates of to the detail of particulars to explain the views I had formed on the subject and the principles upon which I conducted the experiments I conceived that if such an effect as that described by Mr FISHER were generally produced on the rates of watches and chronometers it must arise from the spring or some part of the balance having become magnetic and the consequent attraction of the iron upon it But this would lead us also to conclude that accordingly as the balance was placed in this or that direction with respect to any given mass of iron the rate of the chronometer would be accelerated or retarded and not uniformly accelerated as would seem to be the case by Mr FISHERS observations Or rather perhaps I ought to say that a different direction of the balance would alter the arc of its vibration from greater to less or from less to friends who have in these experiments favoured me with their advice and assistance To my late colleague the Reverend Mr EVANS I am much indebted for the loan of his gold pocket chronometer by EARNSHAW and by his procuring for me through the kindness of Mr PENNINCGTON an excellent box chronometer by that Gentleman marked No 4 in the following series To my friend Captain LY N I am tnder an equal obligation by his having entrusted to my care his very fine box chronometer marked No 3 and by his having procured for me from Mr ARNOLD the silver pocket chronometer No z These two were selected out of a great number which the former Gentleman was employed in rating in consequence of their being de cidedly the most uniform in their action To Captain COL BY and to Mr ART H uR BAILY I amindebted for my introduction to Messrs PARKINNSON and FRODSHAM who in the most liberal and handsome manner furnished me with the two chro nometers No 5 and No 6 The latter of these is adjusted according to the new principle of these makers and was made at the same time and is in all respects similar to their chronometers No zz8 253 254 and 259 which were so much dis tinguished in Captain PARRYS late voyage To these Gentlemen I am also much indebted for the means of making the experiments reported in a subsequent page on the detached chronometrical parts of such a machinecronometers by the proximity of masses of iro greater but it would still depend upon the original adjust ment of the machine whether the result would be to accele rate or to retard its action that is to say it would depend upon the contingency whether the chronometer had a ten dency to gain or lose in short arcs which I am informed is nearly an equal chance if it proceed from the hands of a scientific workman but that in general cases the proba bility is that the watch will lose in large arcs and gain in small ones The experiments and observations which Mr FIsHER de scribes as having been made with a strong bar magnet brought within two inches of the balance I consider to be perfectly distinct in their nature from those which were made by him on board and on shore at Spitzbergen for a magnet of such power brought within the distance of two inches of any small piece of steel will whether the latter be previously magnetic or not impress upon it a strong temporary derange ment of its latent magnetism and give to the part nearest the magnet a contrary pole to that by which it is opposed and consequently there will exist between the balance and the magnet a strong power of attraction sufficient to cause that acceleration so strongly indicated in Mr FISHERs ex periments and this will be the case whichever end of the magnet is opposed to the balance and to whatever part of the latter the application is made because in this instance the effect does not depend upon the previous magnetic state of the balance but upon that temporary state excited by the proximity of the magnetic bar and which ceases when the bar is removed This explanation will not I conceive apply to the action of MDC  cxx A364 MMr BARLOW ot the fects produced in the rates of plain unmagnetized iron for notwithstanding according to the present received doctrine of magnetism every mass of soft iron becomes a temporary magnet by induction from the earth yet I am not aware that ever any particular action has been discovered between two pieces of iron whether hard or soft which had not previously acquired a polar quality the largest mass of iron for instance will not that I am aware of attract and give direction to the lightest and most freely suspended needle of soft iron or of unmagnetized steel Now if this be admitted it necessarily follows that plain unmagnetized iron can only be supposed to act on the balance of a chronometer when that balance has acquired a polar or directive quality and then as I have already stated it will have a tendency to produce an acceleration or retardation according to its position with respect to the balance and the previous adjustment of the machine If this be actually the case it may probably appear sin gular that all Mr FISHERs chronometers were accelerated but it is not much less so that five out of the six which I used in my experiments were as decidedly retarded It will likewise after examining my experiments be difficult to ac count for that high degree of acceleration noticed by Mr FISHER for it will be seen that although I approximated some of my chronometers to within two or three inches of the surface of an iron ball thirteen inches in diameter the utmost effect which I could produce did not exceed 4 per day whereas Mr FISHER makes his amount to 8 or 9 per day and yet we can scarcely imagine that he brought his chronometers so closely within the immediate sphere of action of any mass of iron Ilore powerful than that described inchronometers by the proximity of masses of iron my experiments indeed we are led strongly to suspect that the remarkable change in the rates of the nine chronometers of the Dorothea and Trent reported by Mr FISHER must have been produced by some extraordinary cause not com monly operating on ship board I have already observed that according to the idea I enter tain of the action of iron on the balance of a chronometer it is actually necessary to conceive that part of the machine or at least its spring to have acquired a certain polar or directive quality whereby independent of any other power the balance would have a tendency to assume a certain direc tion when brought within the sphere of action of a given mass of iron and the amount of that tendency might I conceived be estimated by counting the number of vibrations which a small magnetized needle would make in a given time in any assigned situation near the iron and comparing the result with the number it would make under like circum stances and in the same time when wholly removed from any attracting mass In order to illustrate this view of the subject a little more particularly let A B C D fig  P1 XXV represent the ba lance of a chronometer s s its spring and let D be that part of the rim which is attracted by the centre o of an iron ball or shell If now we conceive the spring to be detached from the fixed part of the machine it will be free with the balance itself to take any position The point D will therefore be attracted towards o and if it be displaced from this position it will have a tendency to oscillate on each side of the point D and the number of vibrations which it would make in a given I6oS66 Mr BARLOW on the effects produced in the rates of time would serve if we could obtain such results to estimate the intensity of action of the attracting body But although we cannot detach the balance for such an experiment we may still form some idea of the intensity of action by causing a small magnetized needle to oscillate in the place of the balance and by counting the number of its vibrations as above described Indeed there is not much difficulty in estimating theoretically the change of intensity due to a certain change in the position and distance of the attracting body but I prefer experiment as more satisfactory to those who may not be able to followout completely the mathematical investigation on which such a computation must depend With this previous view of the subject I began with first ascertaining the time in which forty vibrations were made with a small magnetic needle in different situations with respect to an iron shell eighteen inches in diameter and at eighteen inches distance from its centre the weight of the shell being 496 lbs But as the degree of intensity as well as the quantity of deviation occasioned by the iron ball has reference not to the plane of the horizon but to the plane of no attraction I proceeded with these experiments as follows Let S Q N Q fig 2 P1 XXV represent the iron shell or a sphere concentric with it QQ its magnetic equator or plane of no attraction and ab cd ef c parallels of lati tude answering to 60 4 35

by the proximity of masses of iron 367 ridian agreeably to the division of the magnetic sphere as described in my Essay on Magnetic Attraction I now first placed the compass at Q eighteen inches from the centre of the shell and observed the number of seconds which the needle employed to make forty vibrations then still keeping the needle in the circle QQ I placed it 83 from Q towards E or in longitude 60 I then brought it 8o nearer to E or into longitude 30 then to E or longitude o and so on at every go through the whole circle The same was then repeated in the circles ab cd ef c and by taking the mean of the results for each corresponding situ ation on each side of the meridian I obtained the numbers given in the following table TABLE Showzng the time of making ten vibrations with a

finely suspended with untwisted silk in a glass vessel and some care was taken to get the time as accurately as seemed desirable for the purpose  but as the only intention of the experiments was to have some general ideas of those situations near the ball where a compass needle would be the most affected in its vibrations and where also according to my ideas the chronometer would be most affected in its rate I did not conceive it necessary to carry these observa tions to the utmost degree of precision Every thing being thus prepared I applied to my friend the Reverend Mr EVANS to allow the experiments to be conducted at his observatory in which was an excellent transit instrument by TROUGHTON and every thing requisite for conducting them with the greatest accuracy To this request he very readily assented and he superintended the observations with the utmost attention from March i to April 3o when being about to remove to another part of the country he was obliged to dismantle his observatory and the experiments during the rest of the period were carried on in the same way by myself in the Observatory of the Royal Military Academy Explanation of the table of experiments In thefirst column is given the day of the month and in the second the state of the thermometer for each day at ten oclock A M The third column shows the rate of the observatory clock as deduced from each two consecutive transit observations it is of no other use than that of showing the degree of conchronometers by the proximity of masses of iron 369 fidence which is due to the daily rates of the chronometers on those days on which the suns transit could not be taken The fourth column gives the quantity which each chro nometer was fast or slow of mean time every day at noon and from which is drawn the daily rate indicated in thefifth column The sixth column shows the mean daily rate for each period while the chronometers remained in the same position and in the seventh is shown the gain or loss in each position it is found by taking the difference between the actual ob served daily rate and the mean detached rate By the mean detached rate is to be understood the mean rate on all those days when the chronometers were not applied to the ball In order to ascertain whether any law subsisted between the gain or loss of the watch and the magnetic intensity of the place in which it was situated the needle described in a preceding page was vibrated in every situation where a chronometer had stood and the mean time of its making ten vibrations carefully noted and entered in the eighth column and in the ninth is given the proportional magnetic intensity assuming that due to the natural state of the needle at ioo In the tenth and last column is described the particular situation of each chronometer viz its azimuth height from the floor and distance from the centre of the ball These situations are also reduced to their particular latitudes longi tudes and central distances as referred to the ideal sphere circumscribing the ball and explained in a preceding page I have also in every case noted the direction of the chro nometer itself by stating whether

Astronomical Clock of the Royal Military Academy by PENNINGTON The above chronometer is corrected according to the new principle of Messrs PARKINSON and FRODSHAM The rat of this chronometer for days after its return was o39 MDCCCXX I 3C380 Mr BARLOW on the effects produced in the rates of Practical deductions from the results of the preceding experiments The first general conclusion which may be drawn from the foregoing experiments is that the rate of a chronometer is undoubtedly altered by its proximity to iron bodies Secondly  it appears that it is by no means a general case that iron necessarily accelerates the rate of a chronometer as would appear from Mr FISHERS observations for five out of the six chronometers which I have made use of were ob viously retarded in every situation in which they were placed In one instance only viz chronometer No II there is an indication of acceleration in one situation but it is more doubtful than the retardation in all the other five It is also very obvious from the experiments on Nos IV and V that much depends on the direction of the balance with respect to the iron thus No IV lost nearly 2 per day when its 1s oclock hour mark was turned to the South and only seven tenths when it was placed to the East but as soon as the chronometer was returned to its old direction the loss again became 21 daily The same occurred in the case of No V which lost 3 6 per day in one direction and gained 5 in another at right angles to it and on returning it again to its former direction the losing rate became 41 per day viz rather stronger than at first It must be admitted however that the same striking difference in the rate as de pending upon direction was not observed in another instance when a similar experiment was repeated on the same chro nometer Speaking generally it also appears that the greatest effect is produced in those instances where the change in the magnetic intensity is the greatest but there does not seemchronometers by the proximity of masses of iron 381 to be that uniformity of relation in these cases that we should naturally have anticipated As a practical conclusion it is obvious that on shipboard great care ought to be taken to keep the chronometers out of the immediate vicinity of any considerable mass or surface of iron on which account they ought not to be kept in the cabins of the gunroom officers which are on the sides of the vessel and probably a strong iron knee or even a gun will be found at a very inconsiderable distance from the spot where the watch is most likely in this case to be deposited In short it appears from the preceding experiments that a chronometer ought to be kept as carefully at a distance from any partial mass of iron as the compass itself And as much of the iron of a ship is hidden the best way of de tecting it and of ascertaining a proper situation for a chro nometer will be to set down a compass in any place designed for the former and to observe and compare the direction of its needle with that of the azimuth compass on deck while the vessel is on different tacks and if the disagreement between the two be very considerable another situation ought to be selected When I made my experiments on local attraction on board His Majestys ship Leven we placed several compasses in different parts of the vessel some of which were very power fully affected under different directions of the ships head in consequence no doubt of their being within the influence of partial action arising from some near but hidden mass of iron In support and in confirmation of the necessity of taking the above precautions it may not be amiss to state the fol38 Mr BARLOW on the efects produced in the rates of lowing fact A very intelligent seaman many years a Master in the Navy and at present an officer in the Dockyard at Woolwich to whom I was describing the nature of my ex periments immediately exclaimed that they explained a cir cumstance which he had remarked when he was master of a first rate He informed me he always found that his chro nometer which was a very excellent one had a different rate on board and on shore amounting to 5 per day but as he well remembered that the birth he had selected for it was in his cabin nearly in contact with an iron knee he now saw that it was the action of that mass of iron which had caused all his perplexity Lastly since it is rendered obvious by the experiments with the plate of iron on Nos IV and V that the power of the iron to disturb the action of the chronometer resides as in the instance of the compass on the surface and as we know generally the distance and direction of such a plate so that its power may be equal to the mean action of the iron of the vessel we have thence a ready method of ascertaining before a chronometer is sent on board whether the effect of the ships iron will be to accelerate or retard its going and probably a very near approximation to the actual quantity of that change may also be predicted For this purpose it is only necessary to have a box or pedestal as shown in Figure 3 Plate XXV in the side of which a brass pin a b may be fixed to carry the iron plate P and on the top of the box a convenience for placing the chronometer Then having taken its rate in the usual way let it be taken again while the chronometer is placed on the pedestal keeping the plate generally at the distance of aboutchronometers by the proximity of masses of iron twelve inches from the vertical through the centre of the dial and its centre about the same depth below the plane of the balance and the rate thus obtained will be a very close ap proximation to the ship rate of the instrument provided care be taken when it is removed on board to keep it out of tlhe immediate action of any partial mass of iron The plate for this purpose should be a double one such as I have de scribed in my  Essay on Magnetic Attraction and if it weigh about 5lbs it will be sufficient to prevent any partial action It should be observed that the plate is meant as a substi tute for the iron forward and therefore the chronometer when on board should be placed in the same direction in reference to the ships head as it had with respect to the iron plate when its rate was determined that is if the 12 oclock mark of the dial be turned towards the iron plate on shore then must the same be turned towards the ships head when taken on board Experiments on the detached parts of a chronometer As some of the results of the preceding experiments were not precisely what I had anticipated nor quite consistent with the ideas I had formed of the nature of the action between the iron and the balance I was desirous of making some experiments on the detached chronometrical parts in order if possible to trace the irregularity to its source Having mentioned my wish on this subject to Mr FROD SHAM he very cordially and earnestly entered into my views desirous not of avoiding but of meeting openly every diffi culty which presented itself in the construction of such a 83884 Mr BARLOW on the effects produced in the rates of machine the most delicate perhaps of any in the entire circle of the mechanical arts We accordingly went into his worktshop and having de tached a balance from a chronometer we suspended it very nicely in its frame and brought it near a piece of iron of some magnitude which happened to he at hand and an action between it and the balance was rendered immediately obvious and it was of that kind which seemed to imply that it proceeded from the magnetism of the balance or of the spring which remained attached to it  that is if the motion which we gave to the balance terminated in a certain place a trifling recoil or repulsion might be distinguished but if the opposite side of the balance was nearest to the iron when the motion ceased then a slight degree of attraction was equally distinguislable  and Mr FRODSHAM had no doubt that such an action as we then noticed was amply sufficient to change the rate of the chronometer of which the balance formed a part when brought within the sphere of attraction of any such iron mass The above experiment was made with the balance and frame placed near the bottom of the piece of iron it was now repeated near its upper part and a similar action was distinguishable but it appertained to the reverse extremi ties of the balance I have said that these results were such as indicated the presence of magnetism in the balance or spring and it may not be amiss to advert here to this subject a little more par ticularly and to explain how I imagine we may always dis tinguish between the magnetism of the balance and that of the attracting bodychronometers by the prosimity of masses of iron 385 ist If the balance have a polar or directive quality and the iron is pure and free from it except that which is due to position then if the balance be kept below the plane of no attraction the south pole of the former will be attracted and its north pole repelled but if the balance be placed above the plane of no attraction the reverse will take place that is to say that part of the balance which was before repelled will be attracted and that which was attracted will be re pelled and the same will happen whichever of the ends or parts of the iron be turned downwards Therefore when such action as that above described takes place we may infer that the balance is magnetic but that the iron or attracting mass is free from any polar quality except that which it derives from position 2 If the iron and balance were both magnetic then we should have attraction and repulsion as above described but it would have no reference to the plane of no attraction and by inverting the position of the iron the effects of it upon the balance would be reversed also 3 Again if the iron possess the polar quality but the balance and spring are free from it then in every situation either side or part of the balance which is nearest to one of the poles of the attracting body will be attracted and no repulsion will in such case be observed 4 Lastly I am of opinion although it is here as in most other cases difficult to prove a negative that no action what ever will take place between the balance and iron provided they are both free from any fixed polar quality As we were not prepared to pursue our enquiries any far ther at this time Mr FRODSHAM proposed to provide himself386 Mr BARLOW On the effects produced in the ratesof with certain parts of a chronometer and to appoint a day to come to Woolwich and make such experiments as might suggest themselves to him or to me in the interval He there fore prepared for the purpose a new compensation balance in which of course the usual care was taken to prevent the excitement of any local magnetism he also brought withl him a brass balance with two springs of different tempers which might either of them be affixed to the balance in the usual way he had likewise beside the proper frame for sus pending these parts constructed a brass stand whereby the whole might be nisely adjusted to horizontality Our first experiment was on the new compensation balance but although it was brought almost in contact with the iron ball and at that place where by means of our experiments page 370 the intensity was known to be the greatest no action whatever could be discovered We afterwards re peated the same experiments in several other places but without producing the least apparent effect The weights of the balance were now removed in order to render it more light and sensible but no species of action could be discerned We now detached the balance entirely from the ball and presented to it the north end of a bar magnet and then giving the balance a very slight motion it stopped after a short time and arranged itself so that the cross steel bar was directly in a line with the magnet and immediately upon being disturbed from its position it returned to it again The balance being now turned half round so that the other end of the bar was directed towards the magnet the same effect was produced We now turned the magnet end for end but found the attraction still the same between eitherchronometers by the proximity of masses of iron 887 end of the magnet and on each end of the steel bar of the balance and in no case could there be obtained the slightest indication of repulsion from which we may conclude that the balance itself was free from any polar magnetic quality and that every part of it was alike susceptible of the power of the magnet although it was wholly insensible to the action of the iron ball A chronometer therefore with such a balance and with a spring equally free from magnetism would I conceive preserve the same rate both on shore and on ship board although it might be as sensibly affected with a magnet as any of those experimented upon by Mr FISHER We now took the brass balance and having suspended it in its frame applied to it the end of the bar magnet in order to ascertain whether any magnetic quality could be discovered in the brass of which it was composed but no action of that kind could be rendered sensible One of the springs being now attached to it it was applied to the ball whereby a small but sensible effect was produced by the action of the iron and by repeating the experiment in various ways it was ob viously of that kind which indicated magnetism in the spring and a very similar action was discoverable with the other spring Each of these was now applied at a short distance to a very light and sensible compass needle when the polar quality of both was rendered manifest in a very peculiar manner but which it is not necessary to detail in reference to the present enquiry All we learn from these experiments appears to be that when a balance or its spring acquires a magnetic quality the rate of the chronometer of which it forms a part will MDCCCXXI 8 D88 Mr BARLOW on the effects produced in the rates of experience a change when brought within the action of a mass of iron  and a fortiori when it is approximated to a magnet but if the balance and its spring are both free from mag netism then the chronometer will preserve its rate notwith standing the proximity of iron but it will still be acted upon by a magnet I think it however highly probable that the form and office of the spring are precisely those the most likely to create magnetism in it and that when once acquired in this part of the machine it will be soon transmitted to the balance itself and consequently that there are but few chronometers which have been long in use that have not their balances impreg nated with this subtle fluid and which are therefore liable to a change of rate more or less considerable when taken on shipboard or within the influence of a mass of iron I must acknowledge however that there is still some mys tery hanging over this enquiry the only reason that can be assigned for the effect produced by the iron in these cases is that it has a tendency to increase or diminish the vibratory motion of the balance which we must I conceive assimilate to the oscillations of a horizontal needle from which it only appears to differ in its degree of directive intensity But it will have been observed that the nearest approach I could make to the iron did not increase or diminish the intensity of this action so much as in the ratio of  to i notwithstanding which a sensible effect was produced on the rate of the chrono meters whereas from Captain PARRYS and Captain SABINES observations at Melville island it appears that the directive power of the needle was reduced to Lth of what it is in London and yet no change or a very inconsiderable one was7iIrfs MDC CX X7az XCV p3 8d  72 I S c N F  P b J c4tay O dS   I     I 1  tchronometers by the proximity of masses of iron 389 observed in the rates of the chronometers  and this change from the results of the preceding table of experiments would rather appear to be due to the action of the iron on board than to any other cause On the other hand the change of rate reported by Mr FISHER is so much greater than our experiments would give us reason to expect that we cannot help considering his case as an anomalous one and as depending upon some cause not commonly operating on shipboard

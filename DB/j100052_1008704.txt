Legislature of Pennsylvania passed May 25 1889 a commission consisting of eight members was created to prepare a uniform revenue law covering both State and local taxation and to report the same to the next legislature This commission consisted of the AuditorGeneral one representative of the county commis sioners two experts on financial questions and one representative of each of the following industrial interests in the State manufacturers 8so051SIO ANNAIS OF TiHE AMERICAN ACADEMY financial and mercantile interests agricultural interests and wage workers The commission held several meetings in Harrisburg and Philadelphia to which individuals were invited to give their testimony in regard to the defects in the existing system of taxation and to suggest remedies As a result of their deliberations we have a report  containing the bill approved by the majority of the members of the commission with their reasons therefor and supplementary reports by the AuditorGeneral Thomas McCamant by Mr John A Wright and by Professor Albert S Bolles respectively dissenting from the views of the majority and suggesting the reforms which in their opinion are called for in the taxing system This report was submitted to the State Legislature of 189o91 and on the basis of it several bills were proposed and discussed at con siderable length in both Houses The discussion served only to em phasize on the one hand the pressing need of some reform in the tax ing system both State and local and on the other the impossibility of coming to an agreement as to just what reform is demanded on the basis of existing knowledge on the subject The Legislature adjourned without having taken any definite action In the course of the debate it was incidentally suggested on the floor of the Senate by Mr J A Price late of Scranton that representatives of the various material interests in the State on which taxation falls in the first instance should be called together and asked to formulate some plan on the basis of which future tax levies might be equitably distributed This suggestion was received with favor by many of the leading citizens of the State and after considerable correspondence Mr Price on January 25 1892 issued a call for a meeting of representatives of the six great interests in the State viz agriculture transportation manufacturing labor trade and the county commissioners to be held at Harrisburg February 4 1892 In response to this call twentyfour gentlemen representing the above interests came together and created the institution unique in the history of tax reform movements known as the Pennsylvania Tax Conference The peculiarities of this institu tion are Ist it has no legal existence 2d it owes its origin to the efforts of private citizens and is supported entirely by voluntary con tributions and 3d through it all the great interests in the State are working together harmoniously to obtain exact information in regard to the defects of the present taxing system as the necessary prelim inary to any rational discussion of needed reforms During the first meeting of the Tax Conference a permanent chair man and secretary were elected and the following committees were   Report of the Revenue Commission appointed by the Act of the Legislature of Pennsylvania May 25 1889 Pp 198 Philadelphia I89o 8o6THE PENNSYLVANIA TAX CONFERENCE III appointed i A commission to make exhaustive investigations into the value of all classes of property in the State and the taxation of this property 2 a committee to examine the taxing systems of other American States 3 a committee on finance The Tax Conference has held four meetings the last having taken place at Harrisburg February 9 1893 At the third meeting a further committee was appointed to report concerning the principles upon which a new tax bill should be based The conference has discovered that the task of securing the exact information it requires as a basis for a new tax law is one of greater difficulty than was at first anticipated It has not been discouraged however by the magnitude of its undertaking but has pushed on the work with increasing enthusiasm The reports of its committees which have already been submitted and which are promised in the near future will constitute a collection of statistics bearing upon the distribution of property throughout Pennsylvania and the incidence of State and local taxes such as has never before been brought together for any State in the Union Up to the present time besides reports of minor importance from the committees on the taxing systems of other States and on the prin ciples which should underlie a system of State aud local taxation two reports have been submitted by the commission on  valuation and tax ation and printed at the expense of the conference The first of these reports is divided into three parts as follows Part I treats of the actual valuation of all classes of property in the State Part II treats of the amount paid in taxes by each class Part III takes up the amount of property exempted from taxation not covered by the exemptions specified in the constitution of 1874 In order to obtain the facts contained in this report a corps of experts was employed by the commission to visit the different counties and examine the books of the county commissioners No pains were spared to make these statistics as accurate as possible and no one can read the report without feeling that the result is a credit to all those conderned in the investi gation Here we have brought together in compact form just those facts the knowledge of which is most essential as a basis for any new tax legislation If the Tax Conference should disband and have noth ing to show for its activity but this report on  Valuation Taxation and Exemption it yet would have done an immense service to those interested in the promotion of tax reform But it has not been satisfied with this one report which must after all reflect to a large extent the inaccuracies inherent in the  official  statistics supplied by the State   Valuation Taxation and Exemption in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania A Report to the Pennsylvania Tax Conference by the Commission on Valuation and Taxation Jos D Weeks Chairman Harrisburg Oct 13 1892 PP 34 807112 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY and by the counties At present the commission is carrying on three separate investigations much more detailed and laborious in character than the general investigation already brought to a conclusion These are I An investigation into the actual valuation and taxation of real estate in each county of the State 2 An investigation into the actual valuation and taxation of railroad property 3 An investiga tion into the valuation and taxation of all other classes of corporate property in the State In connection with the first investigation the records of fully 30000 sales of farms and lots in different parts of the State are being secured and compared with the assessments of the same appearing upon the books of tax assessors In connection with the second investigation the commission is securing returns from every railroad in the State showing their mileage their issue of stock and bonds and the value of the same and the amounts paid by them in taxes The third inves tigation is expected to accomplish the same result for corporations other than railroads Up to the present time but one report  has been made by the com mission touching these three investigations This report contains some data concerning the actual and assessed valuation of real estate in eighteen counties out of the sixtyseven in the State The records of 5304 sales of farms and lots were examined and compared with their assessed valuation Of these the selling value was 10366897 and the assessed value only 5819976 or 561 per cent of the selling price The relation of assessed value to salable value was found to vary from 371 per cent in Westmoreland County to 818 per cent in Lancaster County I am informed by the permanent secretary of the Tax Conference Mr W R Tucker of Philadelphia that the material for final reports upon the first two subjects of investigation mentioned above real estate and railroads has been already collected and that the investigation of the third subject is well under way We may expect therefore the appearance of these further reports in the course of a few months time When the Commission on Valuation and Taxation has com pleted its statistical labors the committee appointed to discuss the principles which should underlie a new tax law will be in a position to make its final report and the Conference will then proceed to draw up a bill based upon its investigations to be submitted to the next Legislature Up to the present time the Tax Conference has expended eleven thousand dollars in connection with its investigations all of which  Report of the Commission on Valuation and Taxation  presented to the meet ing of the Pennsylvania Tax Conference held at Harrisburg February 9 1893 PP 4 8o8THE PENNSYLVANIA TAX CONFERENCE I 3 has been voluntarily subscribed by citizens of the State interested in tax reform Predictions in regard to the final result of the efforts of the Pennsylvania Tax Conference would be premature at this time but it is safe to say that the citizens of this State have hit upon a very happy expedient for effecting reform in the system of taxation and that sister States laboring likewise under the disadvantages of a taxing system not at all suited to present industrial conditions will do well to adopt a similar policy H R SEAGCR Philadelphia

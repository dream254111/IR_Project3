for L O C K Y E R D A V I S Printer to the R O Y A L S O C I E T Y in Holbourn MDCCLXXIA D V E R T I S E M E N T THE Committee appointed by the Royal Society to direct the publication of the Philosophical Transactions take this opportunity to acquaint the Public that it fully appears as well from the council books and journals of the Society as from repeated declarations which have been made in several for mer Transactions that the printing of them was al ways from time to time the single act of the re spective Secretaries till the Fortyseventh Volume And this information was thought the more necessary not only as it has been the common opinion that they were published by the authority and under the di rection of the Society itself but also because several authors both at home and abroad have in their writ ings called them the Transactions of the Royal Society Whereas in truth the Society as a body never did interest themselves any further in their publication than by occasionally recommending the revival of them to some of their Secretaries when from the par ticular circumstances of their affairs the Transactions had happened for any length of time to be intermitted And this seems principally to have been done with a view to satisfy the Public that their usual meetings were then continued for the improvement of know ledge and benefit of mankind the great ends of their first institution by the Royal Charters and which they have ever since steadily pursued But the Society being of late years greatly inlarged and their communications more numerous it was thought adviseable that a Committee of their Mem bers should be appointed to reconsider the papers read before them and select out of them such as they a 2 shouldA D V E R T I S E M E N T should judge most proper for publication in the future Transactions which was accordingly done upon the 26th of March 1752 And the grounds of their choice are and will continue to be the importance or singu larity of the subjects or the advantageous manner of treating them without pretending to answer for the certainty of the facts or propriety of the reasonings contained in the several papers so published which must still rest on the credit or judgment of their re spective authors It is likewise necessary on this occasion to remark that it is an established rule of the Society to which they will always adhere never to give their opinion as a body upon any subject either of Nature or Art that comes before them And therefore the thanks which are frequently proposed from the chair to be given to the authors of such papers as are read at their accustomed meetings or to the persons through whose hands they receive them are to be considered in no other light than as a matter of civility in re turn for the respect shewn to the Society by those communications The like also is to be said with regard to the several projects inventions and curio sities of various kinds which are often exhibited to the Society the authors whereof or those who ex hibit them frequently take the liberty to report and even to certify in the public newspapers that they have met with the highest applause and approbation And therefore it is hoped that no regard will here after be paid to such reports and public notices which in some instances have been too lightly cre dited to the dishonour of the

Stromeyer amputated 36 times with 36 deaths and Nussbaum 34 times with 34 deaths18 The French results were naturally worse for their armies were constantly being de feated and retreating and especially in the latter part of the war they consisted largely of volunteers while the Germans were mostly veterans of the SchleswigHol stein and AustroPrussian wars Of the Boer War 18991901 only two features need be noticed First that ty phoid attacked 57684 men and killed 8022 while the Boers only killed 7781 Bacteria were more deadly than bullets as Osler has said Secondly the modern missile was for the first time in general use with the result that instead of about 15 per cent of the wounded losing their lives only about 88 per cent died The wounds from the new missile were much less severe and healed more quickly than ever before The first aid packet also had come to the aid of the soldier The Spanish American War surgically speaking was of little moment as the num bers killed and wounded were too small to make the statistics of any great value but it is gratifying to find that only 46 per cent of the wounded died Typhoid however held high carnival It caused 8624 per cent of all the deaths Happily we can say that hereafter thanks chiefly to the antityphoid inocula tionsthere will never be another such holocaust Vide Lecture II The statistics of the RussoJapanese War also need detain us for only a moment I shall only quote the Japanese official sta tistics as given by Major Lynch of our is Wrenchs  Lister  p 236 army19 There were 47387 killed Of 173 425 wounded 11500 died a mortality of 67 per cent The killed and those who died of wounds numbered in all 58887 while the deaths from disease numbered only 27158 a remarkable showing The present war naturally has yielded so far very few statistics These can only be collected and tabulated after some years of peace So far as I can judge I fear that while the mortality from disease except perhaps from typhus especially in Serbia will be less than in former wars the mili tary conditions are such that the larger number of artillery wounds the unavoid able delay in gathering the wounded into hospitals the apparent absence of any truce for collecting the wounded and burying the dead and the virulent infec tion from the soil may result in a large mor tality rate and possibly a larger percent age than in previous wars in spite of the benefits of Listerism But were the first aid packet and the Listerian treatment not available the mortality ratio in this present horrible war unquestionably would be far greater than that which will be recorded This short resum6 gives us some idea of surgical conditions preceding the great revolution inaugurated by Lister to which we will next proceed W W KEEN LADY HUGGINS LADY MARGARET LINDSAY HUGGINS who passed into the higher life March 24 was a personality worthy to be classed with the group of pioneer women of the last century who under difficulties achieved distinction in intellectual fields Mary Somerville was deprived of her candle when her mother found that she was secretly studying Euclid Anna Swanwick was denied 19  Reports of Military Observers attached to the Armies in Manchuria during the RussoJapan ese War Part IV p 399 853N S VOL XLI No 1067 by her father any teaching in Greek as out of all propriety for girls Agnes Clerke when a young girl could get no one to tell her about the stars neither could Margaret Lindsay Murray but they all struggled against odds and reached the goal of knowledge Lady Huggins in a letter speaking of the death of Miss Swanwick the distinguished translator of the tragedies of 2Eschylus remarked It is curious to me to notice what seems an in feriority in some very important ways among the young women coming on who have had every pos sible educational advantage when I compare them with such women as Anna Swanwick who had to struggle for her education I think perhaps everything at present tends to be made too easy The present generation have more knowledge I know and they ought to do more will they Lady Huggins said she was born a lover of the stars Before she reached her teens she worked with a little telescope making drawings of the constellations and sunspots Later in spired by anonymous articles in the magazine Good Words she became interested in the spectrum and made a little spectroscope for herself by which she detected the Faunhofer lines It was the romance of her life that she afterwards became the wife of the astronomer who wrote the papers and with him made many discoveries with the magic instrument The London Times in its notice of Lady Hug gins remarks that Richard Proctor called Huggins the ershele of the Spectroscope and that his wife was to him what Caroline Herschel had been to her brother an un wearied coworker She took upon herself to guide the telescope for the longexposure photographs of the spectra of stars she developed the plates with great skill and her husband remarked on the keenness of her eye and judgment in arranging the plates in sequences representing stellar development The quest for knowledge of this pair was unremitting Their absence from a notable scientific gathering in London was once noted when she remarked Astronomy is a heartbreaking science in Eng land We rarely go anywhere in the evening but wait for breaks in the clouds We discover some thing which seems to be a clue to further knowl edge and wish to pursue it night after night the clouds disappoint us and sometimes we have to wait a year to take up that clue again Lady Huggins constantly shared the excite ment of her husband in the early days of astro physics when as he said every observation revealed a new fact and almost every nights work was redlettered by some discovery She once remarked to a visitor passing in her laboratory a tray in which a fresh print was being washed There is a bomb to be thrown into the astron omers camp It will be harmless but effective Her name appears as joint author of ten of the scientific papers of the second volume of Tulse Hill Publications and as joint editor of all Of the epochmaking first volume  The Atlas of Representative Stellar Spectra she is joint author These two and a third volume entitled The Royal Society containing the addresses delivered by Sir William as president are superb specimens of bookmaking perfect in type work illustration and binding and this achieved by the taste and skill of Lady Huggins The great delight of her vacations was to unearth strange old astronomical drawings and reproduce them in India ink for the initial letters of the chapters of her books or to make sketches in watercolors or by etching An appreciation in an English paper remarks Lady Hugginss striking and attractive person ality expressed itself in her appearance and man ner There was in her not only the conscientiousness thoroughness and care which should be the char acteristic of the scientist but also the imagination and love of beauty which distinguish the artistic temperament She published a paper on an astrolabe of rare workmanship which appealed to her not only for its astronomical association but for its  charm as she expressed it Lady Huggins was greatly interested in the educational and scientific developments in the New World and especially in the educational justice  now given women there Entirely on her own initiative she presented to Wellesley 854 SCIENCEJUNE 11 1915 SCIENCE College Observatory some of her personal astronomical treasures including stained glass panels once in the Tulse Hill home Fur ther bequests to Wellesley College are found in her will In a letter written in her extreme illness stating her decision to make this gift occurs a passage which shows her vision of what America and the students of the Amer ican colleges ought to be and do The first sentence refers to the superb carry ing out of the fire drill which saved so many lives in the great fire of a year ago at Wellesley and the energy and devotion of the alumnse which raised the three million restoration and endowment fund She says I rejoice over the splendid spirit shown by the old Wellesleyans I believe in the real great America I believe in Wellesley College one of its farseeing creations It is to such colleges for the training of young life to create the New Heaven and New Earth to which we all look for ward SARAH F WHITING WHITIN OBSERVATORY WELLESLEY COLLEGE THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA AND THE MAYO FOUNDATION THE executive committee of the board of regents of the

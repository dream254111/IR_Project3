of finding the Value of an infinite Series of decreasing Quantities of a certain Form when it con verges too slowly to be summed in the common Way by the mere Computation and Addition or Subtraction of some of its initial Terms By Francis Maseres Esquire F R S Cursitor Baron of the Exchequer A R T I C L E Ist Let a b c d e f g h c ad insinitum represent a decreasing pro gression of numbers so that b shall be less than a and c than b and d than c and so on of the following num bers ad infinitum Read Feb 13 1777 And 2dly let these numbers be so related to each other that they not only shall form a decreasing progres sion themselves but that their differences ab bc cd de ef fg gh c shall also form a decreasing progression so that bc shall be less than ab and cd than bc and de than cd and so on of the following differences and likewise that the differences of these differences which may be called the second differences of the original numbers a b c d e f g h c shall form a decreasing progression and that the differences of those second differences or the third differences of the original B b 2 numbers188 Mr MASERESS Method of numbers a b c d e f g h c shall also form a de creasing progression and in like manner that the dif ferences of the said third differences or the fourth dif ferences of the original numbers a b c d e f g h c and the fifth and sixth differences and all higher differ ences of the same numbers shall also form decreasing progressions And 3dly let x be a quantity of any magnitude not greater than unity Upon these suppositions the value of the infinite

to it expressing the order of differences to which it belongs These things being supposed the aforesaid infinite se ries a  b x  c x x  d x3  e x4  f x5  g x6  b x7  c will be equal to the following

are to be subtracted from that term Art 3 If we insert the differences themselves instead of DI DII DIII DIV DV c in the foregoing differential series which it may perhaps sometimes be convenient to do that series will be as follows a  b x1  x  b  c x x x1  x2  b  2 c  d x x31  x3  b  3c  3d  e x x41  x4  b  4 c  6 d  4 e  f x x51  x5  b  5 c  10 d  10 e  5f  g x x61  x6  b  6 c  15 d  20 e  15f

thatfinding the Value of an infinite Series c 191 that six or eight of its terms will give the value of the whole and consequently that of the original series a  b x  c x x  d x3  e x4  f x5  g x6  h

greater proportion than that of 1 to 2 because the numerators a b DI DII DIII DIV DV DVI c form a decreasing progression and the denominators increase in the proportion of 2 to 1 Of the investigation of the foregoing differential series Art 5 The foregoing differential series was investi gated by first supposing the original series a  b x  c x x  d x3  e x4  f x5  g x6  h x7  c to be equal to another series whose terms should involve the same powers of x as the former but in which every power of x should be multiplied192 Mr MASERESS Method of multiplied into the same power of the fraction 11x in order to accelerate their convergency and then inquiring what would be the coefficients of the terms of such a series if such a series is possible and what would be the signs to be prefixed to them or in what manner they would be connected with the first term whether by ad dition or subtraction In order to this inquiry I denoted the unknown coefficients of the assumed series by the capital letters P Q R S T V c and wrote down the terms of it near each other without prefixing to them either of the signs  and  but seperated them from each other only by a comma so that the fundamental equation from which I derived the differential series abovementioned was as follows abx  cxx  dx3  ex4 fx5  gx6  hx7  c is  P Q x1  x R x x1  x2 S x31  x3 T x41  x4 V x51  x5 c By necessary deductions from this equation it appeared that P would be equal to a and that all the following terms of the assumed series to wit Q x1  x R x x1  x2 S x31  x3 T x41  x4 V x51  x5 c must be subtracted from the first term P or a and that Q would be equal to bc or DI and Rbccd or b2cd or DII and S  b  2c  d  c2de or b3c3de or DIII and Tfinding the Value of an infinite Series 193 Tb4c  6d  4e  f or DIV and Vb  5c  10d  10e  5f  g or DV and so on of the following coefficients to wit that every new coefficient of the assumed series is equal to the first difference of the next order of the differences derived from the original coefficients b c d e f g h c And from hence I concluded that the series a  bx  cxx  dx3  ex4  fx5  gx6  hx7  c was equal to the series a  bx1  x  DI xx1  x2  DII x31  x3  DIII x41  x4  DIV x51  x5  DV x61  x6  DVI x71  x7  c Art 6 The thought of supposing the original series a  bx  cxx  dx3  ex4  fx5  c to be equal to the series P Q x1  x R x x1  x2 S x31  x3 T x41  x4 V x51  x5 c containing the powers of x multiplied into the same powers of the fraction 11  x in order to accelerate their convergency occurred to me in consequence of reading the late Mr THOMAS SIMPSONS Mathematical Dissertations p 62 63 concerning the summation of serieses in which he makes a supposition of a similar kind Yet there seems to be a considerable difference between his proposition and that which is the subject of these pages for he seems to suppose his quantities p q r s t c which answer to a b c d e c in the notation made use of in the above serieses to form an increasing progression of terms and accordingly subtracts p from q and q from r VOL LXVII C c and194 Mr MASERESS Method of and r from s and s from t and so on and he seems also to suppose the differences qp rq sr ts c to form an increasing progression and every subsequent order of differences to form likewise an increasing pro gression and accordingly subtracts qp from rq and rq from sr and sr from ts and so on whereas in the foregoing series abx  cxx  dx3  ex4  fx5  gx6  hx7  c the numbers a b c d e f g h c are supposed to form a decreasing progression of terms as they are most commonly found to do in the serieses that occur in the solution of mathematical or philosophical problems Examples of the usefulness of the foregoing differential se ries in finding the values of infinite serieses whose terms decrease very slowly Computations of the lengths of circular arcs by means of infinite serieses derived from their tangents Art 7 It is well known that if r be put for the radius of a circle and t for the tangent of any arch in it that is not greater than 45 the magnitude of the arch whose tangent is t will be expressed by the infinite series t  t33rr  t55r4  t77r6  t99r8  t1111r10  t1313r12  t1515r14  c This se ries converges with great swiftness when the tangent is  muchfinding the Value of an infinite Series c 195 much less than the radius but when the tangent is nearly equal to the radius it converges exceeding slowly and when it is quite equal to the radius or the arch is equal to 45 the decrease of the terms is so slow as to make the computation of it in the common way by com puting the value of its initial terms absolutely impracti cable For Sir IS A AC NEWTON has observed concerning this series in that extreme case which then becomes equal to r  r3  r5  r7  r9  r11  r13  r15  c and another series that is almost as slow as this that to exhibit its value exact to twenty decimal places of figures there would be occasion for no less than five thousand mil lions of its terms to compute which would take up above a thousand years See Sir ISAAC NEWTONS second letter to Mr OLDENBURGH dated October 24 1676 in the Commercium Epistolicum p 159 In these cases therefore it will be convenient to make use of some artifice to discover the value of the series t  t33rr  t55r4  t77r6  t99r8  t1111r10  t1313r12  t1515r14  c and we shall find the application of the differential series above mentioned to be a very proper artifice for this purpose Art 8 In order to make this application we must con sider the series t  t33rr  t55r4  t77r6  t99r8  t1111r10  t1313r12  t1515r14  c

ttrr in the terms of this last se ries by which means it will be converted into the series 1  x3  xx5  x37  x49  x511  x613  x715  c This series is of the same form with the original series abovementioned a  bx  cxx  dx3  ex4  fx5  gx6  hx7  c the numeral coefficients 1 13 15 17 19 111 113 115 c of the powers of x in the former series answering to the literal or general coefficients a b c d e f g h c of the same powers in the latter series And these numeral coefficients evidently form a decreasing progression as the coefficients a b c d e f g h c are supposed to do and we shall find upon examination that the differences of these numeral coefficients of the several successive orders also consti tute decreasing progressions as the several successive or ders of differences of the coefficients a b c d e f g h c are supposed to do Consequently the series 1  x3  xx5  x37  x49  x511  x613  x715  c will be equal to the dif ferential series a  bx1  x  DIxx1  x2  DIIx31  x3  DIIIx41

number is true to three places of figures the more exact value of that arch being r x785398163397 c Art 14 It has been asserted in art 12 that in order to obtain the value of the series t  t33 r r  t55r4  t77 r6  t99r8  t1111r10  t1313r12  t1515r14  c exact to 3 places of decimal figures by the mere computation of its terms in the case of an arch of 45 we must compute at least 500 of its terms This may be proved in the following manner The indexes of the powers of t in that series are the odd numbers 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 cfinding the Value of an infinite Series c 207 c in their natural order to which if we add an unit the numbers thereby produced will be the even numbers 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 c in their natural order which are the doubles of the natural numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 c Therefore the number of terms of that series from the beginning of it to any given term in it including the said term is always half the number that is produced by adding an unit to the index of t in the said term Thus if we take the term t1111r10 and add 1 to 11 which is the index of the power of t in it the sum will be 12 the half of which is 6 which is the number of terms in the series from the beginning of it to the term t1111r10 including the said term that term being the sixth term in the series If therefore we take the term t999999r and are desirous of knowing its place in the se ries or the number of terms from the beginning of the series to that term inclusively we must add 1 to the in dex of the power of t in its numerator which will in crease it to 1000 and half this sum to wit 500 will be the number of terms from the beginning of the series to the term t999999r998 inclusively or in other words this term will be the 500th term of the series To arrive therefore at those terms of the series in which the in dexes208 Mr MASERESS Method of dexes of the powers of t are greater than 999 or 1000 or in which the numeral coefficients of the terms which by the law of this series are equal to 1 divided by these indexes are less than 1999 or 11000 it is necessary to compute 500 of its terms Now when t is  r and consequently the literal parts of the terms of this series do not converge at all it is evidently necessary to carry the computation as far as those terms in which the nu meral coefficients of the terms are less than 1999 or 11000 in order to get the value of the series exact to the 1999th or 11000th part of the radius r or to the place of thou sandths or the third place of decimal figures There fore when t is  r or the arch is  45 it is necessary to compute at least 500 terms of the series t  t33rr  t55r4  t77r6  t99r8  t1111r10  t1313r12  t1515r14  c in or der to obtain the value of it exact to three places of de cimal figures that is to the same degree of exactness to which we attained in art 13 by computing only eight terms of the abovementioned differential series Q E D Art 15 But the best way of applying the aforesaid differential series to the investigation of the value of one of these very slow serieses is to compute a moderate number of the first terms of the slow series in the com mon way and then apply the differential series to the 3

the compu tation of the value of the series to that degree of exact ness in that direct manner becomes wholly impractica ble But by the help of the differential series above mentioned its value may be

is an eminent proof of the utility of the said differential series Art 24 In an arch of 90 the versed sine is equal to the radius of the circle that is according to the fore going notation v is  r Therefore by art 17 together with the foregoing computation it appears that the time of the descent of a pendulum or other heavy body moving freely from a state of rest by the force of gravity only through the arch of a whole quadrant of a circle is to the time of the fall through the cor G g 2 respondent228 Mr MASERESS Method of respondent perpendicular altitude or the radius as 1311028779 c x r is to r or as 1311028779 c is to 1 Art 25 Hence we may determine the proportion of the time of descent of a pendulum through an arch of 90 to the time of its descent through an infinitely small arch at the bottom of a quadrant or rather to speak cor rectly to the limit of the time of descent through a very small but finite arch at the bottom of the quadrant to which the said time continually approaches nearer and nearer as the said small arch is taken less and less and to which it may be made to approach so nearly by taking the said small arch sufficiently small as to differ from it by less than any given quantity For this latter time or limit is known to be to the time of the fall of a heavy body through half the length of the pendulum or half the radius of the circle as the semicircumference of a circle is to its diameter that is as the number 1570796326794 c is to 1 But the time of the fall of a heavy body through half the radius of the circle is to the time of the fall through the whole radius as 1 to 2 or 1414213 c Therefore ex aequo the said limit of the time of descent of a pendulum through a very small arch of the circle at the bottom of the qua drant is to the time of the fall of a heavy body through 6 thefinding the Value of an infinite Series c 229 the radius of the circle or the whole length of the pen dulum as 1570796 c is to 1414213 c But we have seen in the last article that the time of the fall of a heavy body through the radius of the circle is to the time of descent of a pendulum through the arch of a whole quadrant as 1 to 1311028779  c There sore the limit of the time of descent of a pendulum through a very small arch at the bottom of the quadrant is to the time of descent through the arch of the whole quadrant as 1570796326 c x 1 is to 1414213 c x 1311028779  c or as 1570796326 c is to 1414213 c x 1311028779  c that is by art 21 as 1570796326 c is to 1414213 c x 1570796326 c x834626843  c or as 1 to 1414213 c x834626843  c or as 1 to 1180340 c or in smaller numbers as 1 to 1180 or as 1000 to 1180 or as 100 to 118 or as 50 to 59 Art 26 This proportion of the times of the de scent of a pendulum through an infinitely small arch at the bottom of the quadrant and through the arch of the whole quadrant agrees pretty nearly with that assigned for them by Mr HUYGENS in the pre face to his admirable Treatise on Pendulumclocks or De Horologio Oscillatorio which is that of 29 to 34 For 50 is to 59 as 29 is to 342 or 3415 or neglecting the fraction 15 as 29 is to 34 Mr HUYGENS meaning230 Mr MASERESS Method c meaning probably in that place not to express this pro portion as accurately as he could but only as nearly as it could be expressed by small whole numbers However the numbers 50 and 59 express this proportion rather more accurately than 29 and 34 and with pretty much the same degree of simplicity and therefore upon the whole are somewhat to be preferred to them Art 27 I have endeavoured to find another differen tial series similar to that above described for the purpose of investigating the value of an infinite series of this form to wit abxcxxdx3ex4fx5gx6hx7 c in which all the terms are marked with the sign  or are added to the first term a when the coefficients b c d e f g h c decrease very slowly and x is very nearly equal to 1 and the terms of the series decrease conse quently so slowly as to make the summation of it in the common way or by the mere computation and addition of its terms almost impracticable but my endeavours have not been attended with success I may therefore from my own experience subscribe to the truth of what is asserted upon this subject by the very learned and in genious Mr JAMES STIRLING in his Treatise intitled Summatio Serierum p 17 to wit that Series quarum termini sunt per vices negativi et affirmativi sunt magis tractabiles quam alterae ubi de Summatione agitur though at first sight one would be apt to imagine the re verse of this proposition to be true

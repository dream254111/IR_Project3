j100276,Michigan Law Review,1278390,Equity Injunction against Wrongful Ouster of Public Officer,i254545,MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW that the Arkansas decree was rendered with personal jurisdiction over both parties and the question of alimony was distinctly raised and passed on in that court In Toncray v Toncray 123 Tenn 476 34 L R A n s IIO6 the complainant sought a divorce and alimony from the defendant who pleaded as a bar a divorce rendered in Virginia The matrimonial domicile was Tennessee but defendant had left his wife and obtained a bona fide domicile in Virginia before getting the divorce The Virginia decree was based on publication and without service of process on or actual notice to the wife Held an action for alimony can be maintained by the wife still domiciled in the state of the matrimonial domicile of the parties although the husband may have obtained a divorce from her based on service by pub lication in a foreign state Here the court protects its own resident In Joyner v Joyner I3I Ga 217 i8 L R A n s 647 the matrimonial domi cile was in Georgia but the husband got a bona fide domicile in Kansas and obtained a divorce based on constructive service on the wife she retaining her Georgia domicile In a separate alimony suit in Georgia the court enforced the Kansas decree on the ground of comity and held it conclusive as to the amount of alimony The wife had actual notice by mail To be effective to cut off further suit for alimony in another state the decree must be valid in that other state either because of the full faith and credit clause or because of comity If the decree is valid since alimony is inci dental to the marriage relation and as divorce dissolves that relation nothing then remains from which the alimony can arise Roe v Roe 52

Court in Detroit by appointment and was notified that the judges of this court had decided to dispense with his services without having given him a hearing as to his competency Held that a court of equity had jurisdiction to enjoin the wrongful removal of the plaintiff Beck v Keidan July 1921 215 Mich 13 Other authorities have held that equity does not have jurisdiction to enjoin the removal of a public officer on the ground that its aid is sought to protect a political right as distinguished from property or civil rights The United States Supreme Court held that a Nebraska court had no power to enjoin the ouster of a police judge upon action by only three members of the city council when an ordinance required action by the whole council In re Sawyer 124 U S 200 The court relied upon Gee v Pritchard 2 Swanst 403 which held that equity jurisdiction was limited to the protection of property rights But see EQUITABLI RELIGF AGAINST DIEAMATION Roscog 238RECENT IMPORTANT DECISIONS POUND 29 Harv L Rev 640 In Ae Sawyer supra left the determination of the right to public offices exclusively to courts of law which might exer cise this power by certiorari error or appeal mandamus prohibition writ of quo warranto or information in the nature of quo warranto That case is followed in Illinois where the court refused to enjoin the removal of a physician appointed by the board of managers of the state reformatory Marshall v Board 201 Ill I Similarly an injunction was refused on the ground of lack of jurisdiction where it was sought to enjoin the removal of the keeper of the penitentiary and putting the sheriff in charge under a void statute Corscadden v Haswell 177 N Y 499 17 HARv L REV 575 In re Sawyer supra was also relied upon in a recent Indiana case where the Appellate Court refused to enjoin certain school trustees who were alleged to be conspiring to prevent the plaintiff from assuming his duties as a newlyelected trustee Haupt v Schmidt Ind 1919 122 N E 343 But immediately following this decision the Supreme Court of Indiana held that a supervisor of oil inspection was entitled to injunctive relief against a rival appointed by the state geologist who was interfering with his duties the court holding that the legal incumbent was entitled to protection until the right of the contestant was determined at law Felker v Caldzell Ind 1919 123 N E 794 In Texas a distinction is drawn between an injunction sought to protect the right to the office as against a rival claimant for the office and an injunction sought to protect the enjoyment of the office as against those who are making no claim to it themselves The former is held to be a political right over which equity has no jurisdiction and the latter is held a proper case for relief For example an injunction was refused to restrain a newlyelected officer from taking the oath of office until his election could be contested Jackson v Houser Texas I918 io8 S W I86 But it was held that an injunction would be granted in favor of an officer against one in possession of another office who claimed the right to perform the duties and collect the fees rightfully belonging to the plaintiff The court pointed out that the inherently political dispute between rival claimants for the same office was not involved in which case it admitted that it could not enjoin Troilo v Gittinger Texas 1921 230 S W 233 Where the governor of Wisconsin summarily and without proper hearing attempted to remove the insurance commissioner an injunction was granted Ekern v McGovern I54 Wis I57 In the principal case the court in justi fying and limiting its decision referred to the fact that there was no one claiming the office of the plaintiff and it was only acting to protect the plaintiffs possession of the de jure and de facto office from wrongful inter ference And it also admitted that its decision would not determine the plaintiffs right to retain the office but that the judges of the Recorders Court might remove him after notice and a proper hearing This does not seem to be an exercise of political jurisdiction and the result appears desir able from the standpoint of the inadequacy of the plaintiffs legal remedy and from the standpoint of the publics interest in insuring the stability of public offices from wrongful interruption 239

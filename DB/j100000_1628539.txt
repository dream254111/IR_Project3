to questions in physiology by high school candidates who had just been passed in physiology in the grammar grades  Pleurisy is a disease of the skin  an in dication that some nerve has been affected Alcohol tobacco and opiates thicken the blood of the nerves The respiratory center is in the heart The heart is the center of respiration  Residual air is the air in the heart The body should be bathed frequent should be bathed at least once a year Appendicitis and pleurisy is a condition of the throat  The blood is carried to the liver through the right and left auricles The meatus auditorius is in the intestines  is an artery leading from the heart  is in the eye is a tube in which the blood passes through before entering the stomach The patella is a network of small blood vesselsis the lining of the abdomen is a tube in the chest is a muscle over the knee  The motores oculi is in the veinsis an organ of voice The mitral valve is at the lower end of the stomach  is located in the liver Excretion is mingling with saliva etc etc Such absurdities are by no means rare in the Kansas schools For several years it was the writers duty to pass upon the papers in physi ology of candidates for the State teachers certificate and many answers as ridiculous as any of the above were observed Thus to the question Why does the human body cease to grow in stature after about the twentyfifth year the reply was almost invariably Be cause it has got its fullgrowth Four out of fif teen answered the question as to what the lym phatic system is by saying that it is a system of vessels that take up the impurities of the blood and discharge them into the kidneys  It was the rare exception that the papers came up to the standard of a respectable high school The worst of it all is that many intelligent people defend such ignorance by saying that you must not expect teachers in the public schools to be experts in physiology Is it not time that such  science is banished from the public schools  I do not know whether Kansas is an exception in this particular as it is per haps in some others to the other States of the Union Certain it is however that such de fects cannot be ascribed to the public school system of the State in general for I honestly believe that this stands on a higher plane than in a majority of the other States Is public school physiology everywhere a farce S W WILLISTON SHORTER ARTICLES UNILATERAL COLORATION WITH A BILATERAL EFFECT  WHILE describing the larval eels or Lepto cephali belonging to the United States National Museum two specimens claimed especial atten tion Structurally these two specimens are very different and might readily be referred to distinct species In one the nares are approxi mated and the pectorals are well developed in the other the nasal openings are wide apart and the pectorals have disappeared The index that pointed to the probability that the two specimens were different stages of the same species is their unique coloration There are eight large black spots much larger and much more conspicuous than the color markings of any other Leptocephalus One of these is lo cated over the alimentary canal a short distance in front of the anus The others are along the side Each one of these spots is formed by a single enormous chromatophore extending lat erally over three or four somites Sometimes a few minute chromatophores are to be found at the margin of the large one There are three of these large chromatophores on the left side of the body and four on the right In each case the spots of one side are arranged at irregular intervals but in both cases the spots of the one side alternate with the spots of the other side so that together they form even in the alcoholic

diptychus C H EIGENMANN CLARENCE KENNEDY UNIVERSITY OF INDIANA VELOCITY OF IONS FROM ELECTRIC ARCS AND FROM HOT WIRES MUCH interest is being shown at present con cerning ionization of gases and  electron the ories of electricity An investigation now in progress promises to throw further light on this subject in fact to change one idea which has been held It has been stated by eminent authorities that in the case of discharge through gases the negative ions always go faster than the positive under the same conditions The present investigation shows that this is not always the case and a brief account of it may not be amiss The work had its origin in an attempt to ex plain the phenomena of the electric arc It was shown in the Physical Review  that all the phenomena of the arc could be explained by assuming first that the current in the arc was carried by ions and second that the positive ions move the more rapidly The second part of this hypothesis did not at first seem probable since in all cases which had previously been in vestigated the negative ions had been found to move the more rapidly Two sets of experi ments were however given as tending to sub stantiate that hypothesis but neither of them could be considered conclusive t More recently experiments have been per formed with ions drawn out from an arc by a charged body in the neighborhood The posi tive ions in this case were found to have the greater velocity Quite recently the same fact has been shown by an application of a Phys Rev 10 151 t Since publishing the abovementioned article I find that part of the work there described had already been described by Dewar Chem News 45 37 My own work was performed without knowledge of that done by Dewar and the method used was not the same as his The results of the two investigations agree fully The explanation of the results offered by myself was not suggested in his article t Phys Rev 12 137 N S VOL XIII No 334 method used by Zeleny  for finding the velocity of ions produced by Xrays These methods are entirely independent and the agreement of the results in the two cases leaves little reason to doubt the correctness of the conclusion that the positive ions here move the more rapidly Of course this is not a proof that the posi tive ions in the arc itself move more rapidly than the negative but since such an assump tion would explain the phenomena of the arc and since the positive ions just outside the arc do have the greater velocity it seems reason able to assume that they do also within the arc It opens up however a still more interesting field of inquiry i e that concerning the con dition under which the positive ions show this peculiarity The discharge from hot platinum and iron wires was accordingly investigated It has long been known that positive electricity escapes from hot metals easier than negative An examinationi of the velocity of the ions from the hot metals showed that here also the positive ions move the more rapidly Both the methods used in the previous investiga tion led to the same conclusion But in all these cases the action is compli cated by the fact that both gases and solids are present For example in the case of dis charge from hot platinum wire atoms of plati num are no doubt given off since it is a well known fact that platinum wire when heated to a white heat decreases in weight t It may be that because of some contact difference of po tential the negative ions of the metal never escape from the metal A comparison of posi tive ions of one substance with negative of an other would not be of great value One would wish to know whether the positive ions move faster than the negative ions from which they have been separated The case of the arc is still more complicated for many different solid and gaseous substances enter into the arc The investigation by Arons I on the arc between metals in H and N at different pressures shows that both the ter minals of the arc and the gases about it must be considered Phil Trans Roy Soc Lon 195 193 t Wied Ann 37 319 t Drude Ann 1 700

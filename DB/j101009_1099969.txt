sought was obtained but before the report of partition 11051106 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER April was confirmed A died and the suit was revived in the names of his children as his heirs A had conveyed a portion of the land to his children in 1882 and in 1887 had executed a deed purporting to convey mineral rights in the same por tion to B B was not made a party to the suit The report of partition was confirmed in 1895 and the portion of the property claimed by them was con veyed by commissioners deed to As children Held that while B was a pur chaser pendente lite his right to attack the deed under

5 The fact that children to whom land has been conveyed by their father revive a suit brought by their father involving the land in their names as heirs and not as purchasers does not estop them to claim under the deed 6 A decree in partition entered after everything has been done in the cause except the settling of costs ascertaining and apportioning the costs is a final de cree and subsequent proceedings by which a part of the land is sold to pay the costs assessed against it are not binding on a purchaser pendente lite who has no notice of such proceedings 7 In a suit for partition where no sale is necessary and none is made for the purpose of partition the court has no jurisdiction to sell the land assigned to one of the parties to satisfy his share of the costs but such costs are a lien upon the land assigned to him which must be enforced like other judgment liens by bill in equity as provided by Code 1887 sec 3571 Va Code 1904 p 1907 WORRELL  WILLIAMS v KINNEAR MFG CO March 9

1AWLINSON comnlenced by saying that the subject to te brollght forward this evening was one which was curious not only in a eographical but in a literazy and to some extent he might say in a political point of view The countries between the northeIn frontiers of our Indian possessions and tlle Bussian enlpize have for many years past been regarded with very considerable interest but no part of that intelvening space had excited so lnuch cUliOSity as the portion lying between the following boundaries Kashmir and Afghanistan on the south the valley of the Jaxartes on the north Turkestan on the east and Bokhaza on the ntest This region of country is marked in many maps as a terea incognita It was not however totally unlKnown for a certain deglee of inforrnation as they would presently see had been obtained froin various souz ces regarding it Geographical sportsmen had been merely accustolued to regard it as a lnanor which had been very little shot overone nloreover abounding with game and to the covers of which accordingly they were sery desirous of obtaining access Under these circusnstances English geographers had been recently much surprised to learn frorn Russian sources that a detailed descliption already existed of a great part of this region and so authentic appeared the annollncement that it became the duty of the Geo glaphical Society to inquire into the nature of these new materials with a view to placing the information which might be obtained from them at the disposal of the public The result of our endeavours to obtain such informasion had led to the present com municatiolz It appettred that sorne four or five years ago notices had been published in the Bussian papers and in Russian periodicals con cerning sonwe remarkable travels through these little  known oountlies lhe first intimlticn he Sir IIenry had of such noticesMARCII 26 1806 PAMIR PtEGION CENTRAL ASIA 135 was derived fIorn a note published by Mr Michell in his wolk entitled 4 The Russians in entral Asia which note was copied from a Ptllssian memoir by M Veniukof published in the Plo ceedlngs of the Imperial Geograpical Society of St Petersburg Shortly after this 51 Khanikof the wellknown Russian Orientalist who takes much interest in the prosecution of Geographical as well as Oriental science wroto a letter on the subject to Sir Roderick Murchison which he Sir Henzy had now in his hands In this letter Mr Khanikof gives an account of a celtain manuscript which he had lately had an opportunity of examining in the arhives of the topographical department of the Ministry of MTar at St Petersburg and which appeared to him so estra ordinaly that he thought it advisable to draw up an abstract from it7 and send it at once to England to be submitted to the Geographicvl Society of this country with a view to elicit information on the subject He Sir Henry would now read an extract from the transla tion of the paper by M Veniukof After discussing the geography of Central AsiaX and the difficulty of getting irlformation concerning it the writer says  I here allucle to the  Travels through Upper Asia from Kashgar Tash balyk Bolor Badakshan Vokhan Kokan urkestan to the Wirghis Steppe and back to Kashmir throurh Samarcand and Yarkend The enumeration aloneof these places must I shollld imaine excite the ilresistible curiosity of all who have made the geography of Asia their stuly These fresh sources of irlformation are truly of the highest importance As regards the  Travels it is to be inferred from the preface and from certain observations in the narrative that the author was a German an aCellt of the Fast India Company despatched in the beginning of this or at the latter part of the last celltury to purchase horses for the British army The original account forms a mannificellt manllseript work in the German langtlaae accompanied by forty sketches of the country traversed 1he text has also been tlanslated into French in a separate manuscriptand the mars svorked into one itinerary in aclmirahle style The Chlistian name of this travellerGeorC Ijllelvir von apIears over the preface but the sllrname has been el ased Withollt entcrint into cletails reslnectinC these matelials I shlll I roceed to gisre extracts froon that ortion which relates immediately to the Bolor and the surrotlnding retion Now the announcement that there nTaS extant a solulue of tranTels illustrated by forty sketches of tlle country and he might add rendered further valuable by a series of thirty astronomical deter minations of latitude and longitude referring to all the most important sites between the English and the Russian frontiers was an attraction of irresistible interest to geographers It certainly seemed extraordinary that a country at which we had been nibblinq from the frontiers for the last fifty ears should all the time haTe 21 6 PAMIR REGION CENTPiAIs ASIA MARCTI 06 t866 been as it were at our disposal throughout its whole extent But the announcelnent was so circllmstantial that we could hardly doubt of its accllracy and the Geographical Society accordingly at once took steps for placing the materials before us b5J request int Mr J Michell a young man of great promise and thoroughly acquainted with Russian to translate for the Society the two papers published by M Veniukof in which copious extracts fscm the nysterious Gersllan manuscript were gilren The translation is now finished and he Sir Henry had the papers on the table and would read estlacts from them as he proceeded with his remarks Before however entering on any Geographical discussion he felt it necessary to say a few words on the general question which avas one of considerable interest and importance If this manuscript welze genuine it was one of the most saluable contributions to our knowledge of Central Asia that had ever been given to the worlcl on the other hand if it were not genuine it was one of the most successful forgeries that had ever been attempted in the history of literature The subjfect was so fraught with difficulty azising from the nature of the arguments on one side and on the other that although he Sir Henry had studied it for weeks and for months and had gone through the task of tracing step by step the route of the supposed Gerxnan travellers it was only recently that he had arrived at a definite opinion and that opinion was that the Travels were nothing more than an elaborate hoas But he must warn the meeting that in stating this to the Geographical SocietJr he took upon himself very great responsibility The Travels had beell accepted as perfectlAr genuine in Bussia The most skilful and experiencecl Geographers and Orientalists of that country had accepted the alleged discoveries without hesitation Maps con structed from these Travels had been adopted by the Russian Gonrernment as the basis of their great maps of Central Asia The rivers and mountains and names of places which were giGren by the anonymous traveller had been drafted into these m3ps and from them transferred to the German maps and frozn the German to the English The great map of Central Asia for instances recently published by Wiepert of Berlin dealt very largely in this material and even Stanfords map of Central Asia the best we have in England accepted many of the Geograpllical features taking them in all probability from Kiepert Sir Henrys condemnation might appear rer decided but he thought that ater a detailed examination of the text of the manuscript Travels  it would be allowed to be well founded There were in the first plaee a nllmbez of incredible statementsWIARCH 26 1866 PAMIR REGION CENTRAL ASIA 137 at the outset about the object of these Travels It was stated for instance that a German officer resident in India had been employed by the East India Company at the commencement of the centuly having under his olders a certain Lieutenant IIarvey and an escort of forty Sepoys to obtairl a large supply of horses fol the Government service It was said that these gentlelnen proceeded with the Sepoys into Central Asia and obtained 130 horses in one pl3Wce and 980 in another which were dulS forwarded to India Tle Gerinan traveller afterwards represented hilnself as having endeavoured to reach the Russian frontier in the prosecution of his journey harring sent back his escort and Lieutenant Halvey He was attacked in the Steppe by the Kirghis and obliged to return to Samarcand frozn whence he passed by Kashgar and Yarkand and Rashrnir to India Now as a prelitninary step to enquiring into the trath of these statements he Sir Henry obtained perinission at the Inaia Ofiice to have a search Inade in our oEcial records with a view to the identification of the individuals concerned and the result of thlt sfearch was thatthere was no transaction of the sort to be traced There was no German employe in the Indian service at the time stated there was no requisition for horses and there was no Lieutellant Harvey in the army during any part of the period to which the narrative could be leferred This negative evidence rather staggered hiin and further consideration confirined his doubts He reflected that at the time in question Upper India was in the hands of the Mahrattas and Washmir was in those of the Afghans To have sent a small escort of forty Sepoys through such countries into the orilds of Central Asia was therefore a moral impossibility And for what purpose was the mission to be sent  They were to obtain horses for the Governinent service but the only horses procurable in Tartary are what are called Kirghis Yaboos a sort of stout ponies wllich are serviceable enough as packhorses but which are quite unfit for cavalry purposes Moorcroft and Trebeck proceeded afterwards it is true into Central Asia in search of a particular breed of horses that it was thought advisable to import into India But it was not to the Pamir plains the country of the Ycboos that their steps were directed but towards Bokhara and Whorassan where Turcomall horses of high breed could be obtained Moreover the lnountainous and difiicult country where the German traveller states he purchased his first batch of horses is one through which it would be impossible to convey the anitnals to their destination He talks indeed of purchasiny and transporting his horses 132 being obtaiiletl in the heart of the rooulltains and138 PAZIIR REGION CENTRAL ASI MARCII 26 1866 980 in the Pamir Steppe near Lake Karakulas if he were travellint in a civilized country intersected with high roads but the very reverse is known to be the case The locality indeed where he describes the first batch of horses as having been purchased is in reality in the centre of a mountainous country where a horse was never heard of the only anitnals used by the inhabitants being aks He says that he there obtained 132 horses and despatched theln to India in the custody of Lieutenant Harvey d but they were yalundered by the 3Iahrattas on the wy to Calcutta and on his returning to claim the price of theln the clainl was refused and lle got into trouble vvith the Governlnent in consequeIsce It ras owing apparently to this misunderstandinp that accordint to his own showing he left the service of the Indian Government and went to Russia where he deposited this manuscript in the archives I3ut the whole story is so suspicious that there is no trusting it lqo nlake out a prima facie case of authenticity it oould be ecessary indeed ln the first place to identify thc individual ho wrote the manuscript and it must ke required moreover of the Bussian authorities to shomr how that manuscIipt got into their archives before they can expect us to give any credit to the state ments it contains But on the other hand the question arises If this is a forgery that could be the object of it  and this is a point that Whanikof in discussing the sllbject with him Sir Heury pressed upon him very stronglr He rnet the allegation of forgery by the silnple question Cui boslo Ullless the man were a monomaniac why sllould he halre devoted a life to the mere purpose of imposing tlpOll geographers  Another circumstance which is it must be admitted in favour cf the authenticity of the document is the elaborateness cf the narrative and the appropriateness of the local names On the Irashmir Dontiar we find Thibetan names In fhe mountains tlle noznenclature belongs to the Kaffir language 1X1 Badakhshall tve llalre Persian vocables and the etymolog5J of the Turkish names to the north is unexceptionable in one instance even we have a genuine Zungarian title All this shows that the author if an im ostor must hal e gone through an enormous alnount of reading and careful study to have prepared a Journal with so great an a1nount of verisi1nilitude The country being practicallS but little lnown to us and llleans being thus wantitlg for trackin the travellers footsteles sage by stage he Sir llenrAT had

139 might be genuine IIowever he was fortified in hs suspicions by the opinions of thoroughly competent judges Among these he miht mentlon Lord Strangford who had looked over the manu script with much care and agreed with hirn that the tra7els were apocryphal As he had said before the country described by this anonymous author was not altogether unknown to us The English had been for sotne time past verJr much interested in the colmtries to the north of India and there had thtls been a large amount of inforanation concerrling them acculnulated in one way or the other either in regularly published works or in papers in scientific journals He had lnade out a list of such authorities in order that geographers who desired to investigate the subject farther might see nvhat a repertory of geographical knowledge could be brollDht to bear upon it In the first place there was Elphinstones  Account of the King dom of Cablll with ZIacartneys Map and hIemcir NVhen Elphin stone was sent to Cabul in 1808 he was supposed to have possessed the lnost accurate and extensive information of any man of the time regarding the statistics and geography of the cotletries on the lSTorth0Nrestern fiontiers of India He had been employed for tears past in the political department of ATorthern Tndia he had access to all the public records and in fact it was fcr some time previous to his mission llis special vocation to collect information on these regions Now if when Alountstuart Elphinstone was preparing for his journey there had been in existence any such inbrmation as that a German ernplo 6 and a Lieutenant of the East India Coanpanys service had been into Central Asia was it con ceivable that he should haxre knolvn nothing about it especially as the Gelnlan traveller saJs he sent duplicate copies of his maps and papers back to India with the horses from the Pamir Steppes  This was one of the most cogent arguments against the authenticity of the narrative br it was Elphinstones especial duty to collect all prelimirlary information available in India before he departed on his anission and he started on his journey not a ear and a half after the date of tlle manuscript in the St Petersbllrg archives After Elphinstones there appeared another very inlportant work Oll the same countries namely the  Travels of Moorcroft and Trebeck These gentlemen traeTelled estensively in

most adinirable work and Eenry Stracheys  Memoir  is the most valuable of all papers on the geo graphy of Thibet There are three papers also by Captain Raverty in the Bengal Asiatic Societys Journal which deserve especial llotice Although Captan Raverty hnself was ouly on the frontiers of the countriesPAMIR REGION CENTRAL ASIA 141 MArtcll 26 l866 which he describes the papers he wrote regarding them contain a mass of most accurate geographical and statistical information and do him great credit He seems to have had the art of extracting from his native iilforrnants a11 that they knew of real value and he has shown great skill in arranging his materials so as to make them generally usefill Thus it would be seen that although we had no person who had actually travelled through the particular tract of couIltry described by the German anonymous writer yet investigations had been made all arouTld it both by Europeans and natives and the leass of information we had obtained from these united sources was suchs that if any person like Mr Arrowsmith brought up in the study of practical geography would take the trouble to test and compare the several routes and supplement them xvith the miscellaneous informa tion otherwise available we might have a thoroughly trustworthy map constructed of the countries between the Russian frontier and the Indus a work which Sir Henry added was still a desideratum in geography The last paper cited on the above list was also remarkaly curious and very little known this was the Journal of Mr Gardner Now ZIr Gardner was an Englishman who appeared really to have travelled some 30 years ago in a zigzag fashion through all the countlies between Salualcand and Kashmir but he kept his Journals in the most eccentric style alld no doubt exaggerated grossly In the forrrl in which tlle journals are now published they are hardly of any use but they may still be some day it is to be hoped reduced to order Mr Gardner indeed is still living in India and he Sir Henry trusted ZIr Edgeworth his editor nvould obtain from him further materials to verify his various routes and amend the vicious orthography which now dis figured the Journal Sir Heury then stated that having given this preliminary sketch he would proceed to read certain portions of the journal of the socalled German traveller SIe remarked that if we had a man writing a journal of travels in a known country we could of course trace him day by dav and step by step and there could then be no question whether the narrative were authentic or not but unfortunately in the present case wherever the ground was accessible to direet inquiry this anonyrnous traveller was vague in the extreme whilst on the other hand when he was once launched on a  terra inconita  he was proportionally diffilse and circutn stantial For instance the estracts from the Travels that have been alone furnished to us commence fiom Kashmir That is a country which we now know pretty nearly as well as India itself142 IAMIR REGION CENTRAL ASIA AIARC I 26 1866 It has been indeed lately triangulated and mapped under the direction of the SurveyorGeneral Sir ltndrew NVaugh as carefully and almost aXs mintltely as England has been mapped by the Ord nance Survey As the author then starts fIonl Kashmir we can join issue at once beeause we are there on known grollnd and can test his accuzacy froln our own knowledge of the country He begins by saying  Haxing quitted Slinagur the capital of Washmir on the 8th of Zlay the date of the year not being given  I passed on the 9th of May in sight of a okano Darrnundan7 which is always smoking and throwing up stones bllt rarely emits flames Now he Sir HenrT mrould ask our Kashmir travellers and he saw mally of thean present at the Zleetiing if there was any such thing in the rhole valley as an actiTe volcano The notice of a volcano withirL a day march of Srinagut was a direct proof of uendacity Then on the 10th he crossed the Indus below the elabollchure of the Luimaki This again is notevwrorthy He leal es Srinagur be it obselved on the 8th and hc crosses the Indus on the lOth Now the direct distance fiom the town of Srinagut to the nearest point of the Indus cannot be wInder 120 miles Goclwirl Allsten oecupied twenttt daas in marching from Srinagut to Iskardo and he Sir Henry believed the Indus could not be reached fiom SIinagur at any point undser fifteen days et this writer pretends that lle crossed the great river on the second day Then again he speaks of the Indus as the sc Sindu  svhile in lealittr there is no such specifie rlame as the Sindu known in tllat oountry The word  Sindu indeed in the language of Kashtnir simply llleans  riarer The Indus is there called the SengeKhabap  the Lion Cataract or the Gyamtso  the big river  of Thibet The writer then pro ceeds to say  WVhen we approachecl Sindu flozn the southeast the direction of Srinagur we saw rising in front of us five high snomTy mountain sulnmits these were llarnely Satchar Olatam Imbra Elnbra the Seat of God Ardlld7 and Darnarit all these were tinged svith purple by the rays cf the sun Now these names are one and all

within 200 niles of the frontier of Kashmir It is remarkable indeed that from the time lle leaves thc XnaUS our traveller never sees any Mahomedansthe natives are a11 heathens lvhereas in reality with

and a daggerstick on the other side completed their equipment Their headdress consisted of a felt hat of irregular shape narrow brimmed and turned up at the sides A strong smell of leather moreover pervaded their presence The first questiotL they asked us was whether we were Mahometans which to their great delight we answered negatively    Here they offered us some darkcoloured wine which they drew with a silver cup out of large jAlS and which we found to be very good    The head man carefully inspected the whole of our party Becoming at last convinced of the truth of our statement he ex

for God alzd must have thus conae frorn some genuine source The anthor soon after resumes his journey and the narrative pro ceeds thus  Advancing higher up the Luimaki we perceived a stone pillar with an inscription the clwaracters of which had nothing in coznmorl with Indian letters the pillar ocourred halfway up the valley on the right side of the road the rows of characters ill it ran oln top to bottom and I concluded tlley were Chinese but as I have no particular knowledge of this language I may have been mistakenNow this account which would be most interest ing if true seems to be quite incredible There is no alphabet in the East which runs in a vertical direction except the Chinese and to find a Chinese inscription on the Peshaver frontier lnay be put donvn as a moral impossibility bllt the compiler of these travels may have heard of the Kapurdagiri inscriptions ill the Yussllfzye country and may have introduced the notice of them into his own narratss without a very clear notion of the characters eln ployed After proceeding three parasangs beyond the pillar we reached ths village of Mestopan    This is the last village of the ChashgurGobi and clustering close to the

mountains The pastllres however were very rich and large flocks of heep and goats were to be seen grazing on them The natives here weave a narrow darkbrown cloth called dccneh out of fine goatls wool they als3 dress and prepare sheep and goat skins very skilfully soznething in the manner of morocco leather The stnell of their leather is stronger than the Russian  Yafta  hence all the natives who employ it in their dress have a strong lathery smell about theln which may be pleasant to those who are fond of its but which to me was very disagreeable Several pillars with large hulnan faces cllt on them representing the features of the dead stand on a srrlall knoll beyond the village these figures are covered with tatters of eloth and oWerings of provisions are placed round them This holy place is called ImtnerUmma n readling this description he Sir Henry thought he remeln bered the lastmentioned words alld he referred accordingly to Mr Elphinstones account of liaffiristan and he there found Ephin stones Cbul sol ii p 397 that Moola Nejib who had been seilt om Peshawer to report orl the Waffirs applied the name of  ImrUmma  to the houses or rude temples in which their sacri fices take place the name merely signifying 44 the house of God Although the Waffirs described by Elphinstone did nof occupy at all the same locality as the Gobis of the German traveller still this coincidence of name applying to their respective temples was re markable and seemed a strong proof of authenticity The narrative however went on to say  Our arrival at the village was cele larated by fresh sotive oWerings of a black rabbit and a large snipe And tllis passage destroyed any confidence to whlch the former coincidence might have given rise for a rabbitand especially a black rabbit was an anilnal entirely unknown in the East and could not possibly have been met with in the highlands of the Indian Caucasus Other points on which he Sir Henry has tested the authenticity of these Trax els were the distances The traarelIer for instance states that he left Srinagllr on the 8th cf May and arriared at Kashgar on the 11th June that is to say in thirtyfive marches N5ow we must deduct ten days from this amount for the time during which he was not travelling He remained as he tells us three daJs at BIestopan on account of very bad weatherX three days at Balgi through a quarrel with the natives two days at iCulsha buying llorses and two days at Talihtomar through a second quarrel rith the natiTes That leaves twentyfiTe days for traelling from146 PANIR REGION CENTRAL ASIA MAICH 26 1866 Kaslomir to Eashgar ATow it must be borne in mind that there really is but one open practicable road from one of these points to the o her This is a road which runs from Slinagur to the Indus at Bonji follows up the Gilgit River by Gilgit and Shirni to Yassin crosses a range to Mastuch in the upper Ghitral Gralley then crosses the great range into Badakhshan descends upon the Osus and follows up that river to the plateau of Pamir which it traverses till it reahes Washgar From the best means he Sir Henry had of calculating this route would occllpy in travelling fifty dafrs or fortyfi e das at the very least The route of Abdul Mejid whose narrative would presently be read conducted from Peshawer to Eastgar very little less ill actual distance and he was three months on the journey actually travelling sixtyfive days Yet this German traveller pretended to have passed by a much more difficult track through the luountains in twentyfive days If that were the only cbjection to the docurnent it would in his Sir EleurJTs opinion be fatal The narrative as it continues gives a variety of curious details which have certalnly a general air of truth although now and then occurs a passage which betrays the fictitious nature of the whole story while with regard to the geography it is so utterly confused in the earlier portion of the narratix7e that no argument can be drawn from it either for or against The manner however in uhich the manuscript is stated to have passed into the hands of the Russian Goternment is remarkable and requires some investi gation It is said that the Gerlnan agent on one occasion sent 980 horses to Washgar for the East India Compantr but whether they ever lseached Illdia or not he omits to tell us He states however that the first batch of 130 horses which he sent to India tInder charge of Lieutenant Earvey were plundered by the Mahrattas that the Governtnent however did not credit this story and on his reaching India accordingly they refused to tay him in con sequence of svhich some very unpleasant discussions arose betsveen the3n This disgusted hiin so much that on his return fiozn Ca1 cutta he passed n to Russia and out of pique placed his maps and journals in the hands of the Russian Governtnent though how this betrayal of his trust could have injured the English it is not very easy to see for there is not throllghotlt the narrative a single political allusion and besides at the time of the transac tions in questin the beginning of the present century no jealollsy whatever had arisen between the Ptussian and the English Govern ments in regard to Central Asia AVe were vertr suspicious at that time of the intriEues and machinations of France in the East but4AICII 26 18C6 PAMIR REGION CENTRiSL ASIA 147 with Russia we were on terms of alliance and confidence so that the pretended explanation of jealousy between us and Russia of which our discontented agent could take advantage to enhance the value of his revelations breaks down altogether and stamps the whole story with unmistakable fraud and fabrication It need hardly be added that if genuine the Travels as contributions to geography would have been equally interesting both to Russians and English Passing on to the pseudotravellers arrival at Kasllgar a large city and a place of great importance the acocunt that he gave of Kashgar stluck him Sir Henry as a wingular combination of truth and fable He gave in the first place a very accurate table of the relative distribution of the inhabitants showing an amount of local ethnoglaphical knowledSe which could only as it would seem have been acquired by personal obselwation but in other respects he seelned grievously at fault He stated for insttmce that the city con tained only 1500 houses and numbered alaongst its 1S000 illhabi tants 325 Armenians who had a fine stone church dedicated to St Sogien and built in 161a Now we have had many accounts of Washgar some of them from native agents and especially from M Aralikhanof son of a lVirghis Sultan who hald been educated in the Bussian service and was an undoubtedly reliable authority and all these authorities combined in giving the number of houses as about 16000 instead of 1o00 and the number of inhabitants as over 6000 It was impossible also to believe in the existence of an Armenian colony at Kashgar in the beginning of the present century Neither in the Chinese nor Russian nor native accounts was there any allusion to such a colony and it lnight be added that there was no St Sogien known in the Armenian calendar There weze other discrepancies too in this Armenian Stoly which dis credited the whole narrative It remained to notice what was one of the most remarkable features in the anonymous narrative namely a list of thirty astro nolnical positions calculated accurately to a second both as to latitude nd longitude Now any geographer must know that to keep a register of observations over a number of months of latitudes and longitudes was a very difficult afair indeed requiring great care and lnuch leisure and he Sir Henly would venture to say that travelling as the German writer professed he was in such a wild country and amongst such nvild tribes the thing was wholly impossible It was to bo observed too that he never alluded in a single passage to his being provided with a sextant or a quadrant or a chronometer or with any instrument whatever necessary for148 PAMIR REGION CENTrwAL ASIA tMAricTi 2d 1866 these determinations There was not indeed a sillgle actual obser vation given but only the results There was no account of any register of observations nor of taking lunars nor of any of the machinery by which the positions were determined Now M Khanikof who was an experienced astlonozner himself seemed to lay great stress on these observations as evidence of good faith Finding indeed that the latitudes v7ere all in error about thirty mintltes he conjectured that this error arose fi om the observers llot taking into calculation the diameter of the sun But in reality tllere is no evidence throllghout the whole narrative that the writer ever took a single observation He merely gives a list of latitudes and longi tudes at the end of his narrative without any indication whatever how they were obtained and his silence in this respect ras one of the most suspicious features of the case Sir Henry then stated that the time did not ermit of his following the footsteps of the German traveller in any detail tllrough the second portion of his pretended journey namely from Kashgar bAr Badakshhan to Kokand The narrative hone7er presented the same straIlge cotnbination of truth and error which he had brought to notice in his previous remarks The ascent of the NTamanyar River from Kashgar to the Lake of Karakul the  Dragon Lake  of the Chillese seemed to be genuine but the description of the town and river of Bolor were pI obably fictitions The positions xnoreover of Badakhshan   Fyzabad  of Wood and Vokhan were reversed the latter being far to the east of the former instead of to the west as the  Travels  and longitudes would seem to indicatf3 Again that there aras ever a Chinese garrison in Badakhshan as stated by the German is opposed to our historical knowledge and Malik Shah Bllzurg resided at Fyzabad and not atTokhan In continuation the extent of the Pamir Steppe seemed to be much too contracted and the positions of 1anglak and Terekchai were transferred from tlle north to the south of the plateau and it svas further SUSpiCiOllS that in pllrsuing the valley of the Jaxartes to Kokand there was no mention of Oosh or Marghilan or any of the other large towns of the dixtrict Sir HenrT in conclusion read to the ZIeeting the following passages fiom the Report of a real travellel in these regions to show the difference between bona fide statements and the ingenious inventions of the German author The traveller in question is Abdul Medjid an agent who was sent in 18G1 bJr the Indian Govern ment with answers to certain letters received from Kokand The Report is compiled by Major James and has been printed in the  Political Records of the Indian Government It

Geographical Society Major Jaines reports as folows There are five routes by which Kokan may be reached from Peshawur the most easterly is that by Cashulere and Ladak crossing the Eara Korum ranre to Yarkand this is the loost circuitous The second proceeds from Peshawllr throllgh the Bajour and Upper Roner valleys into BaeRakshan this is dle most direct but upon the vwhole the most diflicult route It was taken by the Envoy who came from Kokan in 1854 becallse the easier routes to the westward werc cTosel acrainst him in consequence of the existing state of relatiorls between the Ameers of Bokhara and Cabul and the British Govelnnwent On his rettlrn to Kokan he selected tiat by Cashmere and Yarkand The thlee remaining loutes proceed in the first instance to Cabul The most westerly passes throuah Balk and Bokhara to Kokan this is the lest route of all and is that taken by traffic the only lofty range to be crossed is the Hindoo Koosh and the road is practicable for laden camels throllghout indeed after crossing the Oxtls n7heeled carriaCes are in ordinary use but inasmuch as the relations between the Ruler of Kokan and the Kincr of Bokhara and those betweell the latter and thc Ameer of Cabul were not on a friendly footing it was not advisable for the party to adopt it The other to routes  which are known as those of Pamir and Kolabafter crossing the Hndoo Koosh lead

fallen and the road would soon be closed On the 16th of November they ascended to LunDur Wakhan which is the beginninC of the Pamir Steppe  This revion forms the summer pasturelands of the IVirghiz and the huntin grorlnds of freebooting parties Troops of the latter ssveep over the plains anl carry oW into hopeless slavery the surprised travellers without respect to age ses or rank the captives are sold in the cities and villages of Kokan and Kashcar betwecn them and their homes are extensive deserts and flight is rarely attempted The slaves are vigorously worked but Kirghiz wives arc given to thena and the families they obtain are further ties to their new country the majority of slaves in Kokan are Pudakshanees and the chiefs of the latter cotlntry make reprisals on the Kirghis reducing their captives to the same kind of slavery and furnishinc them with wives of Badakshan Thus tsro of the men sent by Shah Ameer BeC with the Moolla as guides anl assistants were Kirghiz slaves they now had families in iBadakshan and the chief felt that he ran no risk of their escalint on the roal  The nomad tribes who brinr their fLoclss and herds of sheep goats camelsX and horses to the steppes in the summer pitch their black tents called khiraah sherever pasture is proculable they are described by the Moolla as strange uncouth felloxvs living trincilzally on mares milk and horseflesh They had now left the steppes and our party fell iu with only one of their camps where they met with stlch treatlllent as showed that a Kirghiz khirgah on the Pamil is to be axoilcd rather than sotlght for Fourteell weary days sere occuied in crossillg the steppe i the marches were lonffl depending on llncertain supplies of trass and water which sometimes rvholly failed them food for man and beast had to be carried with the party7 for not a trace of human habitation is to be met xvith in these inlloslJitable wilds The Kirrhiz guides furnished hy Shah Ameel Beg from Punjal were seldom at fault but hulried on the party for fear of fresh SllOW fallinvo when it xrould be diffictllt to follow the track and the svhole would be likely to lerish The Moolla has given a very quiet statement of their diflSclllties and suSerins on this portion of the journey but they were evidently of no ordinary character the season was already advanced anl most of the roacl was even then covered with snow the cold was intense and otl more than one occasion they passed the nitht as best they collld without a stick to burn or any kind of sheltel at sollle staCes grass and water were not

in circuit and the latter four days the Moolla also crossed the Moorghabee River about midway in the steppe Ill the vicinitsr of this riser and the lakes deer and wild fowl abound on such a journey they must indeed have proved welcome resting places  One of the chief dangers to travellers in the steppe is caused by a nosious wind which prfevails at certain seasons called Dummuk and the Moolla was cautioned before leaving Punjab never to sleep lying down the effect of the wind is said to be that it causes swellint pains and sometimes insensibility one of the party was sei2ed with these symptoms during a storm  Snow which had long threatened fell at length on the last days jotlrney which was accomplished with the greatest difficulty the storm was violents and the aninzals could hardly wade through the fresh snow or face tlle hurricane all trace of the road was lost and the party took refuge on a hillock whilst the guides went in search of the track They had been marching since daybreak and it was now 2 PM but as the Moolla graphically relates  all forgot hunger in looking after life The guides returned with the intelliCence that a herd of horses had been seen and the party made for the SI ot they found eitht men only with the herd and with difficulty procured shelter in the khirgah from the stormy night  On the following day the 30th November the spirits of the party revived on findinC themselves suddenly at the termination of the steppe they were on tne crest of the range south of Kokan and commenced their descent throuoh the Taghlak Pass The road being covered with snow and very steep was difficult to traverse and men and animals were constantly falling The lower slopes were covered with firtrees in a forest of which they found shelter for the night in a cowshed where for the first time his supplies being now exhausted the Moolla felt himself obliged to overcome his scrllples and to dine off a steak of horseflesh  On the 1st of December the party arrived at length in an inhabitel cowlntry and were fairly in the Kokan territories still however there were llO permanent dwellings and the country known as sh Tippah is occupied by the ElBai Rirghiz a tribe of wandering shepherds and herdsmen whose pasturelands are on the slopes of the adjacent mountains The daughter of the chief received them courteously and the Moolla remarks that throughout the country the women are not concealed but take their share in all work and  wear turbans like the men On the Sth of December they arrived at Goolshah the first town they hacl met with It is the residence of Alim Beg a relative of the ruler who haA gone with an expedition to the Russian frontier they were kindly received and hospitably entertained by Alim Begs wife for two days Badakshanee slaves were numerous in this household many of whom had families anxl seemed contented enough but some wept much when they talked of their own country The remaining seven marches were throuCh a finely cllltivated country with large towns and villages they were well received by the local authorities thouCh Khodai Nuzzur Beg did his best on more than one occasion to obtain for his companion a less favourable reception  On the 17th of December the Moolla entered Kokan after a continuous joulmey of nearly three monthsw M 2152 PAMIR REGION CENTRAL ASIA MARCEI 26 1866 On the 3Ist of January 1861 the Moolla left Kokan and was informed that an envoy would overtake him at Yar Mazar the thild march cc The Kolab route having been fixed on they crossed the Kokan ranve by the Koksoo or Drawoot Pass in the seventh and eicrhth marches the road was deep in snow at this season and very difficult They passed throuCh the hilly districts of KarataUhin and Derwazee both tributary to Kokan and fotlnd the road difficult throuhout in some places the snow had to be beaten down by troops of animals before thc party could pass Having made tenty marches from Kokan they arrived in the Kolab district the independent chief of which is Surrah Khan who is very hostile to the Cabul Government and maintains friendly relations with Bokhara With a view therefore of evincing his enmity to the former and of ingratiating hiruself with the latter power this petty chief caused the whole of the party to be seized at Khwaling a town in his territory For four days they were treated with rigour kept separate fiom each other and stinted in their food they were afterwards placed together and treated well thouCh detained against their wishes for more than three weeks Intelligence then arrivefl of the rebellion in Bokhara and of the summons to their aid of the Affghan Sirdars by the people of Shuhr Subz As it seemed probable that his friend would lose his power Sllrrah Khan became as anxious to conciliate the captives as he had fortnerly been to cast indiCnity upon them He at once released them sent costly entertaintnents and dismissed them with dresses of honour  The remainder of the road was gooR and crossing the Oxus on the thirl day they passed through a portion of Badakshan and arrived at KhanaUbad where they were again receivel with hospitality by the Sirdar Mahomed Azim Khan and

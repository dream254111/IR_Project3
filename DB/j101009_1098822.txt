our exemption laws with those of West Virginia we find in each State a Poor Debtors Law and a Homestead Exemption In West Vir ginia the Homestead Exemption is confined to real estate is less extravagant than in Virginia and differs materially in another respect as may be seen from a comparison of the two statutes The Code of West Virginia edition 1891 ch 41 sec 32 page 303 reads as follows The real estate so set apart as aforesaid shall from the time such writing as is mentioned in the next preceding section is or has been delivered to said clerk for record be exempt from all debts and liabilities thereafter contracted and incurred except debts incurred for the purchase money thereof or for the erection of permanent improvements thereon and claims for taxes due thereon But it shall not be exempt from liens and all other debts and liabilities contracted and incurred prior to the delivery of such writing for record as aforesaid etc The corresponding provision in our Code sec 3642 reads as follows The real or personal estate which a householder his widow or minor children are entitled to hold as exempt may be set apart at any time before the same is subjected by sale or otherwise under judgment decree order execution or other legal process In Virginia therefore the householder may claim his exemption at any time before sale of his property while in West Virginia he must claim it before con tracting his debt Exemption laws are designed for varions purposes but chiefly to secure a home to the debtors family in the day of adversity In Virginia there is as strong a prejudice against claiming the homestead as against the plea of infancy or the statute of limitations and many a man whose family really needs its protection will see their home sold rather than subject himself to criticism by pleading it against an honest debt In such cases his family must suffer and the prime object of the law is defeated In West Virginia the exemption stands on the same foot ing as a deed of trust or any other regularly recorded lien having recorded his homestead deed the public are supposed to know of it in advance to deal with reference to it and the householder cannot feel the same hesitation in pleading it The homestead law in Virginia injures the credit of every householder The fact that they may in writing waive its benefits does not save their credit or pro tect their creditors Any retail merchant for example who would require such a waiver every time he credits a householder of moderate means would put the public to great inconvenience and could not hope to compete with other dealers practically he must either refuse credit and lose a customer or allow credit at his peril All homestead laws are passed at the expense of the creditor class It is proper however that they should have all the protection it is possible to give them consistent with the purposes of the law In Virginia the creditor is at his1i0 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER June debtors mercy He must accept any sort of compromise on most open accounts that the debtor is willing to ofter or wait till it suits the debtor to pay he often does not know until he has recovered judgment and brought a chancery suit to sell land whether the homestead will be claimed or not Or if enlightened on this point he sees at once that nothing can be gained by bringing suit the debtor is not pushed to the point of actually filing his homestead deed and uses his property as a basis of credit elsewhere Our homestead law is a hardship not only on the creditor but on the proud debtor and on his family the only perons who really profit by it are those debtors who caring nothing for public opinion wish to bank on what little property they have with the intention of covering this property with a homestead deed when the day of payment comes If a householder conscientiously believes that he is under a higher obligation to provide for his family than to pay his debts it is but just to the community to let it know in advance which of its citizens hold this opinion The property set apart can be exchanged at any time if desired so to the honest householder there can be little hardship in making this announcement Our State constitution prescribes the amount of property which a householder shall be entitled to hold exempt from sale for ordinary debts The legislatnre is not authorized to defeat or impair this right but it is authorized to prescribe in what manner and upon what conditions  the householder is to set apart and hold his homestead Under this legislative authority would it not be expedient to provide as West Virginia and other States have done that any householder desiring the benefit of a homestead shall announce his intention of claiming it describe his property with convenient certainty and place such declaration of intention on public record where all the world can see it  J BALDWIN RANSON Staunton Va OUR TAX LAWS Editor Virginia Law Register A striking instance of the injustice of the tax laws of Virginia is afforded by the following case In 1874 a block of land in the city of Richmond owned by A was divided into 30 foot lots and sold under a decree of court B buying lot No 19 and C buying lot No 16 In 1875 the purchasers received deeds for their respective lots and all of these deed were admitted to record in that year except the one conveying the 30 foot lot described as lot No 19 to B a colored man this deed was admitted to record in 1876 On the 24th day of February 1898 B attempted to pay the taxes on the 30 foot lot mentioned above and received from the clerk of the court a receipt for the taxes of the years 18768318851886 etc to 1895 amounting with interest and clerks fee to a considerable sum On the 14th day of February 1899 application was made under section 666 of the Code as amended by acts 18971898 to purchase a 60 foot lot of land listed on the land books as lots Nos 16 and 19 in the name of A The application also

Society London was presented to the Council asking for an amendment to the ByLaws so that members could vote for the officers at the annual meeting by proxy or by mail As the number of members who can be present at this meeting is not large a comparatively small proportion of the total membership practically controls the offices The Council declined to take any action owing to the fact that such a ByLaw would conflict with the charter An effort was then made to have the Coun cil seek an amendment to the charter which was declined A petition was then presented to have the Council take action to obtain the views of the members by tak ing a mail vote on the question  Are you in favor of the proposal that a supple mental charter should be applied for to the Privy Council so as to enable Fellows to vote at the annual election of the officers by post or proxy This also the Council declines to do The desire of the peti tioners is so manifestly just that it is hardly probable the matter will be allowed to rest at this point but it is to be greatly hoped that the usefulness of the Society will not be impaired by dissensions J L H SCIENTIFIC NOTES AND NEWS THE CHICAGO SECTION OF THE AMERICAN MATH EMATICAL SOCIETY THE third regular semiannual meeting of the Chicago Section of the American Mathe matical Society was held at the University of Chicago on Saturday April 9 1898 with the

amongst the roots by threes are independent of the parameters preliminary communication HEAD PROFESSOR E H MOORE the University of Chicago 9 Dual algebras PROFESSOR JAMES BYRNIE SHAW Illinois College At the opening of the afternoon session in response to the invitation of the program com mittee Professor Michelson of the University Chicago made a very interesting exhibition of the theory and of the workings of the new Harmonic Analyser to the members of the Society PROPERTIES OF THE XRAYS PROFESSOR RONTGEN has made to the Berlin Academy of Sciences a third communication on the Xrays A summary in the Electrical World states that if an opaque plate is placed between the tubes and the screen covering the whole of the latter some fluorescence will still be seen even when the plate is directly on the screen 564 SCIENCESCIENCE he showed that this is due to the fact that the air around the tube gives forth Xrays if our eyes were sensitive to these rays as they are to light then such a tube would be like a light in a room filled with smoke The brightness of a screen illuminated with rapidly intermittent rays depends on a number of properties which he enumerates The Xrays from a platinum focus plate which are most active for showing images are those which leave the plate at the greatest angle but not much greater than 80 thick plates have a relatively larger transpar ency than thin ones that is the specific trans parency of a body is greater the thicker the body when two plates of different bodies are equally transparent they need not necessarily be so when similarly increased in thickness the relative thickness of two equally transpar ent plates of different materials is dependent on the material and its thickness through which the rays have passed before they reach those plates the same body has different trans parencies with different tubes  soft tubes be ing those requiring a small potential and  hard tubes those requiring a high one he states that all bodies are more transparent for rays from hard tubes than from soft ones and in ob taining images this must therefore be consid ered the quality of the rays from the same tube depends on The way in which the inter rupter works the Deprez form acts more regularly while the Foucault form utilizes the primary current better on the spark length in series with the tube on the insertion of a Tesla transformer on the vacuum on other pro cesses in the tube which are not yet fully inves tigated A spark gap in series acts like a Tesla transformer both giving more intense rays which are less easily absorbed the smallest pressure at which Xrays are produced is very likely below 00002 mm of mercury The hardening of a tube is not produced only by continuing the exhaustion to soften a hard tube air may be admitted it may be warmed or the current reversed or very strong dis charges sent through it but the latter generally changes the character of the tube good results were produced with a tube containing a piece of charcoal of linden wood The composition of the rays from a platinum anode depends 565 largely on the element in the current the quality of the rays does not change with changes of the primary current or at least very little but the intensity is proportional to the strength of the primary current between certain limits He draws the following conclu sions The radiation consists of a mixture of rays of different intensity and absorbability the composition depends greatly on the time ele ment in the current the rays produced by the absorption of bodies are different for different bodies as Xrays are produced by cathode rays and as both have common properties it is probable that both processes are of the same nature If two screens are illuminated with two tubes of different hardness the illumina tion being made equal and if then replaced by photographic plates the one illuminated by the harder tube will be blackened much less than the other rays which produce equal fluores cence can be photographically quite different  the usual photographic plates are very trans parent for Xrays in a pile of ninetysix fila ments exposed for five minutes the last one showed photographic action That the eye is not entirely passive to Xrays is shown by an experiment in looking at a slit in a metal screen with the closed eye covered with a black cloth and by moving the head a very weakly illuminated slit will be noticed  this may be ex plained by assuming that fluorescence is pro duced on the retina CHRISTIAN SCIENCE PROFESSOR J MARK BALDWIN has in the press of the Appletons a little book called The Story of the Mind Useful Story Series He allows us to print from the proofs the fol lowing short passage which may have some interest to our readers in view of certain recent discussions by committees of the Massachusetts and New York Legislatures  All mental diseases involve disease of the brain and can be cured only as the brain is cured It does not follow of course that in some cases treatment by mental agencies such as suggestion the arousing of expectation faith etc may not be more helpful here than in trou bles which do not involve the mind provided these agencies be wisely employed but yet the APRIL 22 1898N S VOL VII No 173 end to be attained is a physical as well as a mental cure and the means in the present state of knowledge at any rate are mainly physical means The psychologist knows prac tically nothing about the laws which govern the influence of mind on body The principle of suggestion is so obscure in its concrete work ing that the most practiced and bestinformed operators find it impossible to control its use or to predict its results To give countenance in this state of things to any pretended system or practice of mindcure Christian science spiritual healing etc which leads to the neglect of ordinary medical treatment is to discredit the legitimate practice of medicine and to let loose an enemy dangerous to the public health  Moreover such things produce a form of hys terical subjectivism which destroys sound judg ment and dissolves the sense of reality which it has taken modern science many generations to build up Science has all along had to com bat such wresting of its more obscure and unex plained facts into alliance with the ends of prac tical quackery fraud and superstition and psychologists need just now to be especially alive to their duty of combating the forms of this alliance which arise when the new results of psychology are so used whether it be to sup plement the inadequate evidence of thought transference to support the claims of spiritual ism or to justify in the name of personal lib erty the substitution of a healer for the trained physician The parent who allows his child to die under the care of a Christian science healer is as much a criminal from neglect as the one who going but of step fur ther in precisely the same direction brings his child to starvation on a diet of faith In France and Russia experimenting in hypnotism on well persons has been restricted by law to licensed experts what compared with that shall we think of this wholly amateurish experimenting with the diseased Let the healer heal all he can but dont let him experiment to the ex tremity of life and death with the credulity and superstition of the people who think one doctor is as good as another

JACQUES read on March 31st an interesting paper before the British Institu tion of Naval Architects on  Submarine Tor pedo Boats in which he criticised the con temporary form of torpedo boat asserting its unreliability and general flimsiness and gave as his opinion that it is often more dangerous to its own crew than to the enemy He con siders the submarine torpedo boat the coming 568 SCIENCEAPRIL 22 1898 SCIENCE form of this most modern of naval weapons and points to its complete invisibility in action its power of carrying armor if desired its perfect liberty of movement under water and safety and certainty in placing its torpedo as well as the comfort and safety of its own crew as con siderations that must inevitably ultimately give it the leading place in a naval establishment and especially for one like that of the United States planned mainly for defense THE commercial reporters of Industries and Iron state that Messrs L Lowe  Co of Ber lin Germany manufacturers of electric supplies have ordered from the United States an Allis engine of 900 h p to furnish light and power at their works The Societe des Railways economiques de Liege Seraing et Extensions and the Compagnie generale des Railways a Voie etroite have sent to the United States for a complete electrical equipment of the Vesting house Companys make A large business has been secured by builders of heavy machinery in the United States for delivery in Great Britain and it now seems probable that they may find a profitable and an extensive market on the Continent of Europe The manufacturers of Europe are however reported to have good business and competition from this side of the ocean has not produced any sensible effect in the direction of transfer of trade to this country IT will be remembered that the Paris Interna tional Meteorological Conference of 1896 ap pointed a permanent Committee on Terrestrial Magnetism and Atmospheric Electricity and submitted to it a number of questions for report In order that these questions may be well dis cussed says Nature it has been decided to hold an international conference on terrestrial magnet ism and atmospheric electricity in connection with the forthcoming meeting of the British As sociation at Bristol which will begin on Septem ber 7th Letters of invitation are being sent out by the Committee and all foreigners who propose to attend the conference may obtain tickets of membership of the British Association free of charge on application to the Assistant General Secretary of the Association Among the sub jects to be discussed are The calculation of monthly means with and without taking dis turbed days into account the publication of the monthly means of the components X Y Z and the differences AX AY AZ of the monthly means from the preceding means the establishment of temporary observatories es pecially in tropical countries and the relative advantages of long and short magnets The decisions of the conference upon these questions will be reported direct to the International Meteorological Conference But though the first business of the conference will be to report upon the questions submitted to them papers and communications on other subjects connected with terrestrial magnetism and atmospheric electricity are also invited It is desired that such papers be sent to the Committee some time before the opening of the British Association meeting UNIVERSITY AND EDUCATIONAL NEWS AT a meeting of the Board of Trustees of Cornell University on April 14th it was decided to establish a medical department to be located in New York City The faculty will consist chiefly of the members of the faculty of the New York University Medical College who have been dissatisfied with the relations between the Col lege and the University The new medical col lege like other departments of Cornell Uni versity will be open to women on the same terms as to men and students appointed to State scholarships by the Superintendent of Public In struction may obtain free tuition from Cornell University in medicine hereafter as they now obtain it in art law engineering architecture etc It appears that Colonel Oliver H Payne has given 500000 toward an endowment and that buildings will be erected at once The Col lege will be opened next year with Dr W M Polk as Director AT the same meeting Dr B E Fernow Chief of the Division of Forestry United States Department of Agriculture was elected Direc tor of the College of Forestry recently estab lished by an appropriation from the Legislature of the State of New

J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,106630,SOME PARTICULARS OF THE PRESENT STATE OF MOUNT VESUVIUS WITH THE ACCOUNT OF A JOURNEY INTO THE PROVINCE OF ABRUZZO AND A VOYAGE TO THE ISLAND OF PONZA IN A LETTER FROM SIR WILLIAM HAMILTON K B F R S AND A S TO SIR JOSEPH BANKS BART P R S,I206943,365 XVIII SOME PARTICULARS OF THE PRESENT STATE OF MOUNT VESU VIUS WITH THE ACCOUNT OF A JOURNEY INTO THE PROVINCE OF ABRUZZO AND A VOYAGE TO THE ISLAND OF PONZA IN A LETTER FROM SIR WILLIAM HAMILTON K B F R S AND A S TO SIR JOSEPH BANKS BART P R S READ MAY 4 1786 S I R NAPLES JANUARY 24 1786 T H E ERUPTION OF MOUNT VESUVIUS WHICH BEGAN IN THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER 1784 NEARLY AT THE MOMENT OF MY RETURN FROM ENGLAND TO THIS CAPITAL AND WHICH CONTINUED IN SOME DEGREE TILL ABOUT THE 20TH OF LAST MONTH HAS AFFORDED MUCH AMUSEMENT TO TRAVELLERS UNACQUAINTED WITH THIS WONDER FUL OPERATION OF NATURE BUT NO NEW CIRCUMSTANCE THAT COULD JUSTIFY MY TROUBLING YOU WITH A LETTER ON THE SUBJECT THE LAVA EITHER OVERFLOWED THE RIM OF THE CRATER OR ISSUED FROM SMALL FISSURES ON ITS BORDERS ON THAT SIDE WHICH FACES THE MOUN TAIN OF SOMMA AND RAN MORE OR LESS IN ONE AND AT TIMES IN THREE OR FOUR CHANNELS REGULARLY FORMED DOWN THE FLANKS OF THE CONICAL PART OF THE VOLCANO SOMETIMES DESCENDING AND SPREADING ITSELF IN THE VALLEY BETWEEN THE TWO MOUNTAINS AND ONCE WHEN THE ERUPTION WAS IN ITS GREATEST FORCE IN THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER LAST THE LAVA DESCENDED STILL LOWER AND DID SOME DAMAGE TO THE VINEYARDS AND CULTIVATED PARTS AT THE FOOT OF VESUVIUS TOWARDS THE VILLAGE OF ST SEBASTIANO BUT GENERALLY B B B 3 THE366 SIR WILLIAM HAMILTONS DESCRIPTION THE LAVA NOT BEING ABUNDANT STOPPED AND COOLED BEFORE IT WAS ABLE TO REACH THE VALLEY BY THE ACCUMULATION OF THESE LAVAS ON THE FLANKS OF VESUVIUS ITS FORM HAS BEEN GREATLY ALTERED AND BY THE FREQUENT EXPLOSION OF SCORIAE AND ASHES A CONSI DERABLE MOUNTAIN HAS BEEN FORMED WITHIN THE CRATER WHICH NOW RISING MUCH ABOVE ITS RIM HAS LIKEWISE GIVEN THAT PART OF THE MOUNTAIN A NEW APPEARANCE JUST BEFORE I LEFT NAPLES IN MAY 1783 I WAS AT THE TOP OF VESUVIUS THE CRATER WAS CER TAINLY THEN MORE THAN 250 FEET DEEP AND WAS IMPRACTICABLE ITS SIDES BEING NEARLY PERPENDICULAR THIS ERUPTION HOWEVER HAS BEEN AS SATISFACTORY AS COULD BE DESIRED BY THE INHABITANTS OF THIS CITY A PRODIGIOUS QUANTITY OF LAVA HAVING BEEN DIS GORGED WHICH MATTER CONFINED WITHIN THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH WOULD PROBABLY HAVE OCCASIONED TREMORS AND EVEN SLIGHT ONES MIGHT PROVE FATAL TO NAPLES WHOSE HOUSES ARE IN GENE RAL VERY HIGH ILL BUILT AND A GREAT NUMBER IN ALMOST EVERY STREET ALREADY SUPPORTED BY PROPS HAVING EITHER SUFFERED BY FORMER EARTHQUAKES OR FROM THE LOOSE VOLCANIC SOILS HAVING BEEN WASHED FROM UNDER THEIR FOUNDATIONS BY THE TORRENTS OF RAIN WATER FROM THE HIGH GROUNDS WHICH SURROUND NAPLES AND ON WHICH A GREAT PART OF THE TOWN ITSELF IS BUILT FROM THE TIME OF THE LAST FORMIDABLE ERUPTION OF MOUNT VESUVIUS IN AUGUST 1779 DESCRIBED IN ONE OF MY FORMER COMMUNICATIONS TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY TO THIS DAY I HAVE WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE FATHER ANTONIO PIAGGI  KEPT AN EXACT DIARY OF THE OPERATIONS OF VESUVIUS WITH DRAWINGS SHEWING BY THE QUANTITY OF SMOKE THE DEGREES OF FERMENTA  THIS PADRE ANTONIO PIAGGI IS THE INGENIOUS MONK WHO INVENTED THE METHOD OF UNFOLDING AND RECOVERING THE BURNT ANCIENT MANUSCRIPTS OF HERCULANEUM AND WHO RESIDES CONSTANTLY AT RESINA AT THE FOOT AND IN FULL VIEW OF MOUNT VESUVIUS 4 TIONOF THE ISLAND OF PONZA 367 TION OF THE VOLCANO ALSO THE COURSE OF THE LAVAS DURING THIS LAST ERUPTION AND THE CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE FORM OF THE MOUNTAIN ITSELF BY THE LAVAS AND SCORIAE THAT HAVE BEEN EJECTED THIS JOURNAL IS BECOMING VERY CURIOUS AND INTERESTING IT IS REMARKABLY SO WITH RESPECT TO THE POINTING OUT A VARIETY OF SINGULAR EFFECTS THAT DIFFERENT CURRENTS OF AIR HAVE UPON THE SMOKE THAT ISSUES FROM THE CRATER OF VESUVIUS ELEVATED AS YOU KNOW SIR MORE THAN 3600 FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE SEA BUT EXCEPT THE SMOKE INCREASING CONSIDERABLY AND CONSTANTLY WHEN THE SEA IS AGITATED AND THE WIND BLOWS FROM THAT QUARTER THE OPERATIONS OF VESUVIUS APPEAR TO BE VERY CAPRICIOUS AND UNCERTAIN ONE DAY THERE WILL BE THE APPEARANCE OF A VIOLENT FERMENTATION AND THE NEXT ALL IS CALMED AGAIN BUT WHENEVER THE SMOKE HAS BEEN ATTENDED WITH CONSIDERABLE EJECTIONS OF SCORIAE AND CINDERS I HAVE CONSTANTLY OBSERVED THAT THE LAVA HAS SOON AFTER MADE ITS APPEARANCE EITHER BY BOILING OVER THE CRATER OR FORCING ITS PASSAGE THROUGH CREVICES IN THE CONICAL PART OF THE VOLCANO AS LONG AS I REMAIN IN THIS COUNTRY AND HAVE THE NECESSARY ASSISTANCE OF THE ABOVEMENTIONED INGENIOUS MONK WHO IS AS EXCELLENT A DRAUGHTSMAN AS HE IS AN ACCURATE AND DILIGENT OBSERVER THE VESUVIAN DIARY SHALL BE CONTINUED AND I HOPE ONE DAY TO HAVE THE HONOUR OF PRESENTING THESE CURIOUS MANUSCRIPTS WHICH BEGIN NOW TO BE VOLUMINOUS TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY IF IT SHOULD THINK THEM WORTHY OF A PLACE IN THE LIBRARY OF THE SOCIETY HAVING NEVER HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF EXAMINING THE ISLANDS OF PONZA PALMAROLE ZANNONE AND OTHER SMALL ISLANDS OR RATHER ROCKS SITUATED BETWEEN THE ISLAND OF VENTOTIENE AND MONTE CIRCELLO NEAR TERRACINA ON THE CONTINENT AND THINKING THAT BY A TOUR OF THESE ISLANDS I SHOULD BE ENABLED TO RENDER MY FORMER OBSERVATIONS MORE COMPLETE AND TO COMMUNICATE TO368 SIR WILLIAM HAMILTONS DESCRIPTION TO YOU SIR SOME ACCOUNT OF THE ONLY VOLCANIC PARTS OF THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD HITHERTO UNDESCRIBED I DETERMINED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE ABSENCE OF THEIR SICILIAN MAJESTIES WHO WERE THEN MAKING THE TOUR OF ITALY AND VISIT THESE ISLANDS BUT BE FORE I PUT THIS PLAN IN EXECUTION I MADE A LONG EXCURSION IN THE PROVINCE OF ABRUZZO AS FAR AS THE LAKE OF CELANO AN CIENTLY CALLED FUCINUS AND WHERE THE FAMOUS EMISSARY OF THE EMPEROR CLAUDIUS A MOST STUPENDOUS WORK  FOR DRAINING THAT LAKE REMAINS NEARLY ENTIRE THOUGH FILLED UP WITH RUBBISH AND EARTH IN MANY PARTS AND OF COURSE USELESS THE WATER OF THIS LAKE WHICH IS MORE THAN 30 MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE IN CREASES DAILY AND IS DESTROYING THE RICH AND CULTIVATED PLAINS ON ITS BORDERS IT IS SURROUNDED BY VERY HIGH MOUNTAINS MANY OF THEM COVERED WITH SNOW AND AT THE FOOT OF THEM ARE MANY VILLAGES AND RICH AND WELL CULTIVATED FARMS UPON THE WHOLE IT IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LAKE I EVER SAW AND WOULD BE COMPLETE IF THE NEIGHBOURING MOUNTAINS WERE BETTER WOODED THIS LAKE FURNISHES ABUNDANCE OF FISH BUT NOT OF THE BEST QUALITY A FEW LARGE TROUT BUT MOSTLY TENCH BARBEL AND DACE IN THE SHALLOW WATER ON THE BORDERS OF THE LAKE I SAW THOUSANDS OF WATER SNAKES PURSUING AND PREYING UPON A LITTLE FISH LIKE OUR THORNBACKS BUT MUCH BETTER ARMED THOUGH THEIR DEFENSIVE WEAPONS SEEMED TO AVAIL THEM BUT LITTLE AGAINST SUCH RAVENOUS FOES I WENT WITH TORCHES INTO THE EMISSARY OF CLAUDIUS AS FAR AS I COULD IT IS A COVERED UNDERGROUND CANAL THREE MILES LONG AND GREAT PART OF IT CUT THROUGH A HARD ROCK THE OTHER PARTS SUPPORTED BY MASONRY WITH WELLS SUNK TO GIVE AIR AND LIGHT  A DESCRIPTION OF THIS EMISSARY OF CLAUDIUS WITH PLANS THOUGH NOT VERY EXACT HAS BEEN PUBLISHED BY FABRETTI IN THE SAME BOOK IN WHICH HE HAS GIVEN AN ACCOUNT OF TRAJANS COLUMN ACCORDINGOF THE ISLAND OF PONZA 369 ACCORDING TO SUETONIUS CLAUDIUS EMPLOYED THIRTY THOU SAND MEN ELEVEN YEARS ON THIS GREAT WORK INTENDED TO CONVEY THE SUPERFLUOUS WATER OF THE LAKE INTO THE BED OF THE RIVER LIRIS NOW CALLED GARIGLIANO AND I MAKE NO DOUBT BUT THAT IF IT WAS CLEARED AND REPAIRED IT WOULD AGAIN ANSWER THAT PURPOSE IN ITS PRESENT STATE IT IS A MOST MAGNIFICENT MONUMENT OF ANTIQUITY THE WHOLE COUNTRY FROM ARPINO THE NATIVE PLACE OF MA RIUS BY ISOLA SORA CIVITELLA AND CAPISTRELLO TO THE LAKE OF CELANO IS IN MY OPINION INFINITELY MORE BEAUTIFUL AND PICTURESQUE THAN ANY SPOT I HAVE YET SEEN ON THE ALPS IN SAVOY SWITZERLAND OR THE TYROL THE ROAD IS NOT PASSABLE FOR CAR RIAGES AND INDEED IS SCARCELY SO EVEN IN SUMMER FOR HORSES OR MULES AND IS OFTEN INFESTED WITH BANDITTI A PARTY OF WHICH CONSISTING OF TWENTYTWO HAD QUARTERED THEMSELVES IN A VILLAGE WHICH I PASSED THROUGH AND LEFT IT BUT A WEEK BEFORE MY ARRIVAL THERE ARE MANY WOLVES AND SOME BEARS IN THE ADJA CENT MOUNTAINS WHICH ALSO COMMIT THEIR DEPREDATIONS IN THE WINTER THE TYGERCAT GATTO PARDO OR LYNX IS SOMETIMES FOUND IN THE WOODS OF THIS PART OF ABRUZZO THE ROAD FOLLOWS THE WINDINGS OF THE GARIGLIANO WHICH IS HERE A BEAUTIFUL CLEAR TROUT STREAM WITH A GREAT VARIETY OF CASCADES AND WATERFALLS PARTICULARLY A DOUBLE ONE AT ISOLA NEAR WHICH PLACE CICERO HAD A VILLA AND THERE ARE STILL SOME REMAINS OF IT THOUGH CONVERTED TO A CHAPEL THE VALLEY IS EXTENSIVE AND RICH WITH FRUIT TREES CORN VINES AND OLIVES LARGE TRACTS OF LAND ARE HERE AND THERE COVERED WITH WOODS OF  MARIUS HAD A LARGE VILLA ABOUT TWELVE MILES DISTANT FROM ARPINO I WENT TO VISIT THE SPOT ON WHICH NOW STANDS THE ONLY CONVENT OF THE AUSTERE ORDER OF LA TRAPPE IN ITALY IT IS IN THE POPES STATE AND HAS BEEN EVIDENTLY BUILT OF THE RUINS OF MARIUSS HOUSE AND ITS PRESENT NAME IS CASA MARI OAK370 SIR WILLIAM HAMILTONS DESCRIPTION OAK AND CHESTNUT ALL TIMBER TREES OF THE LARGEST SIZE THE MOUNTAINS NEAREST THE VALLEY RISE GENTLY AND ARE ADORNED WITH EITHER MODERN CASTLES TOWNS AND VILLAGES OR THE RUINS OF ANCIENT ONES THE NEXT RANGE OF MOUNTAINS RISING BEHIND THESE ARE COVERED WITH PINES LARCHES AND SUCH TREES AND SHRUBS AS USUALLY ABOUND IN A LIKE SITUATION AND ABOVE THEM A THIRD RANGE OF MOUNTAINS AND ROCKS BEING THE MOST ELEVATED PART OF THE APENNINE RISE MUCH HIGHER AND BEING COVERED WITH ETERNAL SNOW MAKE A BEAUTIFUL CONTRAST WITH THE RICH VALLEY ABOVEMENTIONED AND THE SNOW IS AT SO GREAT A DISTANCE AS NOT TO GIVE THAT UNCOMFORTABLE CHILL TO THE AIR WHICH I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND IN THE NARROW VALLIES OF THE ALPS AND THE TYROL EXCUSE ME SIR IF FROM THE IMPRESSION WHICH THIS ENCHANTING AND LITTLE FREQUENTED COUNTRY HAS LEFT ON MY MIND I HAVE BEEN LED TO DEPART FROM THE SUBJECT OF THIS LETTER TO WHICH I WILL RETURN DIRECTLY ON THE 15TH OF AUGUST LAST I WENT IN A FELUCCA TO THE ISLAND OF ISCHIA I HAVE NOTHING TO ADD TO MY FORMER OBSERVATIONS ON THIS ISLAND ALREADY COMMUNICATED TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY EX CEPT THAT ABOUT SIXTY YARDS FROM THE SHORE AT A PLACE CALLED ST ANGELO SITUATED BETWEEN THE TOWNS OF ISCHIA AND FURIA A COLUMN OF BOILING WATER BUBBLES UPON THE SURFACE OF THE SEA WITH GREAT FORCE AND COMMUNICATES ITS HEAT TO THE WATER OF THE SEA NEAR IT BUT AS THE WIND WAS VERY HIGH AND THE SURF CONSIDERABLE I WAS NOT ABLE THEN TO EXAMINE THIS CURIOUS SPOT AS I COULD HAVE WISHED BUT WILL RETURN THERE ON PURPOSE SOME OTHER TIME THE INHABITANTS OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD TOLD ME THAT IT ALWAYS BOILED UP IN THE SAME MANNER WINTER AND SUM MER AND THAT IT WAS OF GREAT USE TO THEM IN BENDING THEIR PLANKS FOR SHIPBUILDING AND THAT THE FISHERMEN ALSO FREQUENTLY MADE USE OF THIS NATURAL CAULDRON TO BOIL THEIR FISH THOUGH I HAVEOF THE ISLAND OF PONZA 371 HAVE PASSED AT DIFFERENT TIMES MANY WEEKS IN THE ISLAND OF ISCHIA I NEVER BEFORE HEARD OF THIS PHAENOMENON BUT IN MY DESCRIPTION OF THIS ISLAND MENTION IS MADE OF SEVERAL SPOTS WHERE NEAR THE SHORE I HAD FOUND WHEN BATHING IN THE SEA THE SAND UNDER MY FEET SO HOT AS TO OBLIGE ME TO RETIRE HASTILY THIS BOILING SPRING REMINDS ME OF ONE NEAR VITERBO IN THE ROMAN STATE WHICH I HAVE SEEN AND IS CALLED THE BULICAME IT IS A CIRCULAR POOL OF ABOUT SIXTY FEET IN DIAMETER AND EX CEEDINGLY DEEP THE WATER OF WHICH IS CONSTANTLY BOILING IT IS SITUATED IN A PLAIN SURROUNDED BY VOLCANIC MOUNTAINS A STONY CONCRETION FLOATS ON THE SURFACE OF THE POOL WHICH BEING CARRIED OFF BY THE SUPERFLUOUS WATER IS DEPOSITED AND IS CON STANTLY FORMING A LABES OR TUFFA OF WHICH ALL THE SOIL AROUND THE POOL IS COMPOSED YOU HAVE SEEN SIR THE LIKE OPERATION IN GREATER PERFECTION IN ICELAND AT THE FAMOUS BOILING SPRING OF GEYSER I AM CONVINCED THAT MANY OF THE FINER SORT AND MOST COMPACT TUFFAS WE MEET WITH IN COUNTRIES FORMED BY VOL CANOES HAVE BEEN PRODUCED IN THE SAME MANNER THE 18TH OF AUGUST I ARRIVED AT THE ISLAND OF VENTOTIENE ABOUT TWENTYFIVE MILES FROM ISCHIA IT IS GREATLY IMPROVED SINCE MY FORMER VISIT SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS AGO WHEN HIS SICI LIAN MAJESTY FIRST PLANTED A LITTLE COLONY THERE IT THEN PRO DUCED NEITHER CORN NOR WINE NOW IT FURNISHES ANNUALLY AT LEAST SEVENTY BUTTS OF WINE AND TWO THOUSAND TOMOLI OF CORN THE SOIL IS REMARKABLY FERTILE FROM WHENCE IT PROBABLY TOOK ITS ANCIENT GREEK NAME OF PANDATARIA THIS ISLAND CONTAINS AT PRESENT MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED INHABITANTS THE ISLAND OF VENTOTIENE AND THE SMALLER ONE CALLED ST STEFANO WITHIN A MILE OF IT HAVING BEEN DESCRIBED IN MY CAMPI PHLEGRAEI AS BEING BOTH ENTIRELY COMPOSED OF VOLCANIC MATTER I NEED NOT TROUBLE YOU FURTHER ON THEIR SUBJECT I WILL ONLY MENTION A V O L LXXVI C C C CURIOUS372 SIR WILLIAM HAMILTONS DESCRIPTION CURIOUS CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE NATURAL HISTORY OF BIRDS OF WHICH I WAS INFORMED BY AN OFFICER OF THE GARRISON OF VENTOTIENE WHO IS A GREAT SPORTSMAN AND SHOOTS OFTEN IN THE ISLAND OF ST STEFANO INHABITED ONLY BY HAWKS AND A LARGE KIND OF SEA GULLS BUT IS OCCASIONALLY VISITED AS A RESTING PLACE BY DIVERS SORTS OF BIRDS OF PASSAGE IN THE MONTH OF MAY GREAT FLIGHTS OF QUAILS ARRIVE THERE FROM AFRICA SPENT WITH FATIGUE AND MANY OF THEM FALL AN EASY PREY FOR THE HAWKS AND SEA GULLS BUT AS THEIR ARRIVAL DEPENDS UPON ONE PREVAILING WIND THERE IS OFTEN AN INTERVAL OF MANY DAYS BETWEEN ONE FLIGHT AND ANOTHER MY INFORMER ASSURED ME THAT THE HAWKS CONSTANTLY DURING THE FLIGHTS MAKE A PROVISION OF EACH DAYS PREY LAYING THEM UP IN SEPARATE HEAPS OF SIX OR SEVEN NEAR THEIR HAUNTS ALWAYS FEEDING FIRST UPON THOSE OF THE OLDEST DATE THE SEAGULLS HAVE NOT THE SAME FORESIGHT BUT GREEDILY FALL UPON THEIR UNHAPPY VICTIMS IN THEIR LANGUID STATE BEFORE THEY REACH THE SHORE AND HAVING BEAT THEM DOWN INTO THE SEA SWALLOW NUMBERS OF THEM WHOLE EXTRAORDINARY AS THIS MAY APPEAR YET AS FACTS RELATED BY PERSONS OF CREDIBILITY IN ANY BRANCH OF NATURAL HISTORY ARE ALWAYS PLEASING I THOUGHT YOU WOULD EXCUSE THIS DIGRES SION GIVE ME LEAVE LIKEWISE TO ADD FOR THE INFORMATION OF THE CURIOUS IN ANTIQUITIES THAT DURING MY STAY IN THE ISLAND OF VENTOTIENE I GOT OUT OF THE RUINS OF AN ELEGANT ANCIENT BATH SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN BUILT FOR THE USE OF JULIA DAUGHTER OF AUGUSTUS WHILST SHE WAS IN EXILE HERE A FRAGMENT OF A TILE ON WHICH ARE STAMPED THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERS IN BASSO RELIEVO HACINI IVLIAI AVGVS F WHICH ACCORDING TO THE INTERPRETATION OF A CELEBRATED ANTI QUARY AT NAPLES MEAN OPUS HACINI AD COMMODUM BALNEI JULIAE AUGUSTAE FACTUM I WAS INFORMED THAT SEVERAL ENTIRE TILESOF THE ISLAND OF PONZA 373 TILES WITH A LIKE INSCRIPTION HAD BEEN DUG UP ON THE SAME SPOT AND HAD BEEN MADE USE OF IN BUILDING THE CHURCH AND BARRACKS NEWLY ERECTED IN THIS ISLAND ANOTHER FRAGMENT OF A TILE WAS LIKEWISE FOUND HERE AND GIVEN TO ME WITH THE FOLLOWING INSCRIPTION SAB A PI WHICH THE SAME ANTIQUARY EXPLAINS SABINAE AVGVSTAE PIAE IMPERATRICI DICATUM BALNEUM BUT I BELIEVE THERE IS NO MEN TION IN ANCIENT AUTHORS OF SABINA HAVING BEEN AT PANDATARIA OF JULIAS BANISHMENT TO THIS ISLAND THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT BETWEEN VENTOTIENE AND THE ISLAND OF PONZA AND FROM THE LATTER AT THE DISTANCE OF ABOUT TWELVE MILES A GROUP OF ROCKS RISE SEVERAL FEET ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE SEA THEY ARE CALLED THE BOTTE AND ARE COMPOSED OF A COMPACT LAVA PROBABLY THEY ARE THE SMALL REMAINS OF ANOTHER VOLCANIC ISLAND THE SOFTER PARTS OF WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN CARRIED OFF AND LEVELLED BY THE ACTION OF THE SEA WHICH IS OPEN AND VIOLENT HERE THE 20TH OF AUGUST I ARRIVED AT THE ISLAND OF PONZA ABOUT THIRTY MILES FROM VENTOTIENE AND THE NEXT DAY I WENT ROUND IT IN MY BOAT IT IS NEAR FIVE MILES LONG ITS GREATEST BREADTH NOT MORE THAN HALF A MILE AND IN SOME PARTS NOT MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED FEET IT IS SURROUNDED BY INNUMERABLE DETACHED ROCKS SOME OF THEM VERY HIGH AND MOST OF WHICH ARE OF LAVA IN MANY ARE REGULARLY FORMED BASALTES BUT NONE IN LARGE COLUMNS IN SOME PARTS THE BASALTES HAVE A REDDISH TINT OF IRON OCHRE ARE VERY SMALL AND IRREGULARLY LAID ONE OVER ANOTHER SOME MASSES OF THEM ARE IN A PERPENDICULAR OTHERS IN AN HORI ZONTAL AND OTHERS AGAIN IN AN INCLINED POSITION AND THE ROCKS THEMSELVES IN WHICH THESE MASSES ARE FOUND ARE LAVA OF THE SAME NATURE AS THE BASALTES AT FIRST SIGHT THESE ROCKS HAVE VERY MUCH THE APPEARANCE OF THE RUINS OF ANCIENT ROMAN C C C 2 BRICK374 SIR WILLIAM HAMILTONS DESCRIPTION BRICK OR RATHER TILE BUILDINGS AS MAY BE SEEN IN THE DRAWING SEE TAB XI FIG 1 TAKEN ON THE SPOT ONE ROCK AS APPEARS IN THE DRAWING SEE TAB XII FIG 4 IS COMPOSED OF LARGE SPHERICAL BASALTES AND IN MANY PARTS OF THE ISLAND I FOUND THE LAVA HAD INCLINED TO TAKE THE LIKE SPHERICAL FORM THOUGH ON A MUCH SMALLER SCALE SOME OF THE FIRST MENTIONED ROUND BASALTES BEING NEAR TWO FEET IN DIAMETER ALL THESE ROCKS HAVE CERTAINLY BEEN DETACHED BY THE ACTION OF THE SEA FROM THE ISLAND WHICH IS INTIRELY COMPOSED OF VOLCANIC MATTER LAVAS AND TUFFAS OF VARIOUS QUALITIES AND TINTS GREEN YELLOW BLACK AND WHITE SOME OF THE TUFFAS AS WELL AS THE LAVAS ARE OF A TEXTURE MORE COMPACT THAN OTHERS AND IN SOME PARTS OF THE ISLAND GREAT TRACTS SEEM TO HAVE UNDERGONE THE SAME OPERATION AS IS MENTIONED IN ONE OF MY FORMER COMMUNICATIONS TO BE IN FULL FORCE AT A SPOT CALLED THE PISCIARELLI ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE SOL FATERRA NEAR PUZZOLE AND WHERE A HOT SULPHUREOUS VITRIOLIC ACID VAPOUR CONVERTS ALL WHICH IT PENETRATES WHETHER LAVAS TUFFAS VOLCANIC ASHES OR PUMICE STONES INTO A PURE CLAY MOSTLY WHITE OR WITH A LIGHT TINT OF RED BLUE GREEN OR YELLOW THE APPEARANCE OF A TRACT OF VOLCANIC COUNTRY WHICH HAS UNDERGONE THIS OPERATION IS WELL EXPRESSED IN THE VIEW OF THE INSIDE OF THE HARBOUR OF PONZA TAB XI FIG 2 BUT I WAS SO STRUCK WITH THE BEAUTIFUL AND UNCOMMON APPEARANCE OF ONE OF THESE HIGH VOLCANIC GROUNDS CONVERTED TO A PURE LIGHT COLOURED CLAY TAB XII FIG 1 IN CONTRAST WITH A NEIGHBOUR ING DARK BASALTIC ROCK THAT I CAUSED THE DRAWING WHICH ACCOMPANIES THIS LETTER SEE TAB XII TO BE MADE ON THE SPOT YOU SIR WHO HAVE SEEN SUCH A VARIETY OF COUNTRIES WILL STILL THINK THIS VIEW SINGULAR AND BEAUTIFUL I CAN ASSURE YOU IT IS VERY EXACT EXCEPT THE ROCK OF ROUND BASALTES FIG 4 WHICH IN NATURE IS AT A DISTANCE FROM THIS SPOT AND ONLY PLACED HERE TOOF THE ISLAND OF PONZA 375 TO ILLUSTRATE WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN ON ITS SUBJECT IN ONE PART OF THE ISLAND THERE IS A SORT OF TUFFA REMARKABLY GOOD FOR THE PUR POSE OF BUILDING IT IS AS HARD AS OUR BATH STONE AND NEARLY OF THE SAME COLOUR WITHOUT ANY MIXTURE OF FRAGMENTS OF LAVA OR PUMICE STONE WHICH USUALLY ABOUND IN THE TUFFAS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF NAPLES BAIA AND PUZZOLE THE DRAWING SEE TAB XI WHICH IS A VIEW OF THE HARBOUR OF PONZA WILL GIVE YOU A VERY GOOD IDEA OF THE APPEARANCE OF THE ISOLATED ROCKS OF LAVA AND BASALTES WHICH HAVE BEEN SEPA RATED BY THE FORCE OF THE SEA FROM THE SOFTER PARTS OF THE ISLAND AND OF WHICH THERE ARE AN INFINITE NUMBER AS YOU WILL SEE IN THE EXACT GEOMETRICAL PLAN OF THE ISLAND OF PONZA TAB X WHICH LIKEWISE ACCOMPANIES THIS LETTER WHEN I WAS LAST IN ENGLAND I INQUIRED OF MANY OF THE MANUFACTURERS OF GLASS WHETHER IT HAD EVER HAPPENED THAT THE GLASS COOLING IN THEIR FURNACES HAD TAKEN ANY DISTINCT FORMS LIKE PRISMS OR CRYSTALLIZATIONS BUT I GOT NO SATISFACTORY ANSWER UNTIL I APPLIED TO THE INGENIOUS MR PARKER OF FLEETSTREET WHO NOT ONLY INFORMED ME THAT SOME YEARS AGO A QUANTITY OF HIS FLINT GLASS HAD BEEN RENDERED UNSERVICEABLE BY TAKING SUCH A FORM IN COOLING BUT ALSO GAVE ME SEVERAL CURIOUS SPECI MENS OF THE GLASS ITSELF SOME OF THEM ARE IN LAMINAE WHICH MAY BE EASILY SEPARATED AND OTHERS RESEMBLE BASALTIC COLUMNS IN MINIATURE HAVING REGULAR FACES I WAS MUCH PLEASED WITH THIS DISCOVERY PROVING TO ME BEYOND A DOUBT THE VOLCANIC ORIGIN OF MOST BASALTES MANY OF THE ROCKS OF LAVA OF THE ISLAND OF PONZA ARE WITH RESPECT TO THEIR CONFIGURATIONS STRIKINGLY LIKE THE SPECIMENS OF MR PARKERS ABOVEMEN TIONED GLASS NONE BEING VERY REGULARLY FORMED BASALTES BUT ALL HAVING A TENDENCY TOWARDS IT MR PARKER COULD NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE ACCIDENT THAT OCCASIONED HIS GLASS TO TAKE THE BASALTIC FORMS376 SIR WILLIAM HAMILTONS DESCRIPTION FORMS BUT I HAVE REMARKED BOTH IN SICILY AND AT NAPLES THAT SUCH LAVAS AS HAVE RUN INTO THE SEA ARE EITHER FORMED INTO REGULAR BASALTES OR HAVE A GREAT TENDENCY TOWARDS SUCH A FORM THE LAVAS OF MOUNT ETNA WHICH RAN INTO THE SEA NEAR IACCI AS APPEARS IN MY ACCOUNT OF THEM IN THE CAMPI PHLEGRAEI ARE PERFECT BASALTES AND A LAVA THAT RAN INTO THE SEA FROM MOUNT VESUVIUS NEAR TORRE DEL GRECO IN 1631 HAS AN EVIDENT TEN DENCY TO THE BASALTIC FORMS ON MOUNT VESUVIUS I NEVER FOUND ANY THING LIKE COLUMNS OF BASALTES EXCEPT THE ABOVE MENTIONED AT TORRE DEL GRECO AND SOME FRAGMENTS OF VERY COMPLETE ONES WHICH I PICKED UP NEAR THE CRATER AFTER THE ERUPTION OF 1779 AND WHICH HAD BEEN THROWN OUT OF THE MOUTH OF THE VOLCANO THE ISLAND OF PALMAROLE WHICH IS ABOUT FOUR MILES FROM PONZA IS NOT MUCH MORE THAN A MILE IN CIRCUMFERENCE IS COMPOSED OF THE SAME VOLCANIC MATTER AND PROBABLY WAS ONCE A PART OF PONZA AND INDEED IT APPEARS AS IF THE ISLAND OF ZANNONE WHICH LIES AT ABOUT THE SAME DISTANCE FROM THE ISLAND OF PONZA WAS ONCE LIKEWISE A PART OF THE SAME ISLAND OF PONZA FOR MANY ROCKS OF LAVA RISE ABOVE WATER IN A LINE BETWEEN THE TWO LAST MENTIONED ISLANDS AND THE WATER IS MUCH SHAL LOWER THERE THAN IN THE OTHER PARTS OF THE GULPH OF TERRACINA THE ISLAND OF ZANNONE IS LARGER AND MUCH HIGHER THAN PAL MAROLE AND THE HALF OF THE ISLAND NEAREST THE CONTINENT IS COMPOSED OF A LIMESTONE EXACTLY SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE APEN NINES ON THE CONTINENT NEAR IT THE OTHER HALF IS COMPOSED OF LAVAS AND TUFFAS RESEMBLING IN EVERY RESPECT THE SOIL OF THE OTHER ISLANDS JUST DESCRIBED NEITHER PALMAROLE NOR ZANNONE ARE INHABITED BUT THE LATTER FURNISHES BRUSHWOOD IN ABUN DANCE FOR THE USE OF THE INHABITANTS OF PONZA WHOSE NUMBER INCLUDING THE GARRISON AMOUNTS TO NEAR SEVENTEEN HUNDRED THEOF THE ISLAND OF PONZA 377 THE UNINHABITED ISLAND OF ST STEFANO FURNISHES FUEL IN THE LIKE MANNER FOR THE INHABITANTS OF VENTOTIENE IT IS PROBABLE THAT ALL THESE ISLANDS AND ROCKS MAY IN TIME BE LEVELLED BY THE ACTION OF THE SEA PONZA IN ITS PRESENT STATE IS THE MERE SKELETON OF A VOLCANIC ISLAND AS LITTLE MORE THAN ITS HARDER VITRIFIED PARTS REMAIN AND THEY SEEM TO BE SLOWLY AND GRADUALLY MOULDERING AWAY OTHER NEW VOLCANIC ISLANDS MAY LIKEWISE BE PRODUCED IN THESE PARTS THE GULPHS OF GAETA AND TERRACINA MAY IN THE COURSE OF TIME BECOME ANOTHER CAMPO FELICE  FOR AS HAS BEEN MEN TIONED IN ONE OF MY FORMER COMMUNICATIONS ON THIS SUBJECT THE RICH AND FERTILE PLAIN SO CALLED WHICH EXTENDS FROM THE BAY OF NAPLES TO THE APENNINES BEHIND CASERTA AND CAPUA HAS EVIDENTLY BEEN INTIRELY FORMED BY A SUCCESSION OF SUCH VOL CANIC ERUPTIONS VESUVIUS THE SOLFATERRA AND THE HIGH VOLCA NIC GROUND ON WHICH GREAT PART OF THIS CITY IS BUILT WERE ONCE PROBABLY ISLANDS AND WE MAY CONCEIVE THE ISLANDS OF PROCITA ISCHIA VENTOTIENE PALMAROLE PONZA AND ZAN NONE TO BE THE OUTLINE OF A NEW PORTION OF LAND INTENDED BY NATURE TO BE ADDED TO THE NEIGHBOURING CONTINENT AND THE LIPARI ISLANDS ALL OF WHICH ARE VOLCANIC MAY BE LOOKED UPON IN THE SAME LIGHT WITH RESPECT TO A FUTURE INTENDED ADDITION OF TERRITORY TO THE ISLAND OF SICILY IF YOU CAST YOUR EYE SIR ON THE MAP AT THE HEAD OF MY DESCRIPTION OF THE CAMPI PHLEGRAEI YOU WILL BETTER UNDERSTAND MY MEANING  THE GOVERNOR OF THE CASTLE OF PONZA WHO HAS RESIDED THERE FIFTYTHREE YEARS TOLD ME THAT THE ISLAND WAS STILL SUBJECT TO EARTHQUAKES THAT THERE HAD BEEN ONE VIOLENT SHOCK THERE ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO BUT THAT THE MOST VIOLENT ONE HE EVER FELT THERE WAS ON THE VERY DAY AND HOUR OF THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE WHICH DESTROYED LISBON THAT TWO HOUSES OUT OF THREE WHICH WERE THEN ON THE ISLAND WERE THROWN DOWN THIS SEEMS TO PROVE THAT THE VOLCANIC MATTER WHICH GAVE BIRTH TO THESE ISLANDS IS NOT EXHAUSTED THE378 SIR WILLIAM HAMILTONS DESCRIPTION THE MORE OPPORTUNITIES I HAVE OF EXAMINING THIS VOLCANIC COUNTRY THE MORE I AM CONVINCED OF THE TRUTH OF WHAT I HAVE ALREADY VENTURED TO ADVANCE WHICH IS THAT VOLCANOES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN A CREATIVE RATHER THAN A DESTRUCTIVE LIGHT MANY NEW DISCOVERIES HAVE BEEN MADE OF LATE YEARS PARTICU LARLY AS YOU WELL KNOW SIR IN THE SOUTHSEAS OF ISLANDS WHICH OWE THEIR BIRTH TO VOLCANIC EXPLOSIONS AND SOME INDEED WHERE THE VOLCANIC FIRE STILL OPERATES I AM LED TO BELIEVE THAT UPON FURTHER EXAMINATION MOST OF THE ELEVATED ISLANDS AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM CONTINENTS WOULD BE FOUND TO HAVE A VOLCANIC ORIGIN AS THE LOW AND FLAT ISLANDS APPEAR IN GENERAL TO HAVE BEEN FORMED OF THE SPOILS OF SEA PRODUCTIONS SUCH AS CORALS MADREPORES C BUT I WILL STOP HERE AND NOT DEVIATE FROM THE PLAN WHICH I HAVE HITHERTO STRICTLY FOLLOWED OF REPORTING FAITHFULLY TO MY LEARNED BRETHREN OF THE ROYAL SO CIETY SUCH FACTS ONLY AS COME IMMEDIATELY UNDER MY OWN OB SERVATION AND AS I THINK MAY BE WORTHY OF THEIR NOTICE AND LEAVE THEM AT FULL LIBERTY TO REASON UPON THEM WE MAY FLATTER OURSELVES AS A VERY GREAT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE OF LATE YEARS IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF VOLCANOES THAT BY COMBINING SUCH OBSERVATIONS AS WE ARE ALREADY IN POSSESSION OF WITH THOSE WHICH MAY BE MADE HEREAFTER IN THE FOUR QUARTERS OF THE WORLD IN ALL OF WHICH NATURE SEEMS TO HAVE OPERATED IN A LIKE MANNER A MUCH BETTER THEORY OF THE EARTH MAY BE ESTA BLISHED THAN THE MISERABLE ONES THAT HAVE HITHERTO APPEARED THOSE WHO HAVE NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF EXAMINING A VOLCANIC COUNTRY AS I HAVE FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS WOULD LITTLE SUSPECT THAT MANY CURIOUS PRODUCTIONS AND COMBI NATIONS OF LAVAS AND TUFFAS WERE OF A VOLCANIC ORIGIN ESPE CIALLY WHEN THEY HAVE UNDERGONE VARIOUS CHEMICAL OPERATIONS OF NATURE SOME OF WHICH AS I HAVE MENTIONED IN A FORMER 4 COMMUOF THE ISLAND OF PONZA 379 COMMUNICATION AS WELL AS IN THIS HAVE BEEN CAPABLE OF CON VERTING TUFFAS LAVAS AND PUMICE STONE INTO THE PUREST CLAY I HAVE REMARKED THAT YOUNG OBSERVERS IN THIS BRANCH OF NATURAL HISTORY ARE BUT TOO APT TO FALL INTO THE DANGEROUS ERROR OF LIMITING THE ORDER OF NATURE TO THEIR CONFINED IDEAS FOR EXAMPLE SHOULD THEY SUSPECT A MOUNTAIN TO HAVE BEEN A VOL CANO THEY IMMEDIATELY CLIMB TO ITS SUMMIT TO SEEK FOR THE CRATER AND IF THEY NEITHER FIND ONE OR ANY SIGNS OF LAVA OR PUMICESTONE DIRECTLY CONCLUDE SUCH A MOUNTAIN NOT TO BE VOLCANIC WHEREAS ONLY SUPPOSE MOUNT ETNA TO HAVE CEASED ERUPTING FOR MANY AGES AND THAT HALF OF ITS CONICAL PART SHOULD HAVE MOULDERED AWAY BY TIME WHICH WOULD NATURALLY BE THE CONSEQUENCE AND THE HARDER PARTS REMAIN IN POINTS FORMING AN IMMENSE CIRCUIT OF MOUNTAINS ETNA EXTENDING AT ITS BASIS MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES SUCH AN OB SERVER AS I HAVE JUST MENTIONED WOULD CERTAINLY NOT FIND A CRATER ON THE TOP OF ANY OF THESE MOUNTAINS AND HIS IDEAS WOULD BE TOO LIMITED TO CONCEIVE THAT THIS WHOLE RANGE OF MOUNTAINS WERE ONLY PART OF WHAT ONCE CONSTITUTED A COMPLETE CONE AND CRATER OF A VOLCANO IT CANNOT BE TOO STRONGLY RECOMMENDED TO OBSERVERS IN THIS AS WELL AS IN EVERY OTHER BRANCH OF NATURAL HISTORY NOT TO BE OVERHASTY IN THEIR DECISIONS NOR TO ATTRIBUTE EVERY PRODUCTION THEY MEET WITH TO A SINGLE OPERATION OF NA TURE WHEN PERHAPS IT HAS UNDERGONE VARIOUS OF WHICH I HAVE GIVEN EXAMPLES IN THE ISLAND WHICH HAS BEEN THE PRINCIPAL SUB JECT OF THIS LETTER THAT WHICH WAS ONE DAY IN A CALCAREOUS STATE AND FORMED BY AN INSECT IN THE SEA BECOMES VITRIFIED IN ANOTHER BY THE ACTION OF THE VOLCANIC FIRE AND THE ADDITION OF SOME NATURAL INGREDIENTS SUCH AS SEA SALTS AND WEEDS AND IS AGAIN TRANSFORMED TO A PURE CLAY BY ANOTHER CURIOUS PROCESS V O L LXXVI D D D OF380 SIR WILLIAM HAMILTONS DESCRIPTION OF NATURE THE NATURALIST MAY INDEED DECIDE AS TO THE PRESENT QUALITY OF ANY NATURAL PRODUCTION BUT IT WOULD BE PRESUMP TION IN HIM TO DECIDE AS TO ITS FORMER STATES AS FAR AS I CAN JUDGE IN THIS CURIOUS COUNTRY ACTIVE NATURE SEEMS TO BE CON STANTLY EMPLOYED IN COMPOSING DECOMPOSING AND RECOM POSING BUT SURELY FOR ALLWISE AND BENEVOLENT PURPOSES THOUGH ON A SCALE PERHAPS MUCH TOO GREAT AND EXTENSIVE FOR OUR WEAK AND LIMITED COMPREHENSION I HAVE THE HONOUR TO BE WITH GREAT REGARD AND ESTEEM C W HAMILTON P O S T S C R I P T THE EARTH IS NOT YET SO PERFECTLY QUIET IN CALABRIA AND AT MESSINA AS TO ENCOURAGE THE INHABITANTS TO BEGIN TO RE BUILD THEIR HOUSES AND THEY CONTINUE TO LIVE IN WOODEN BAR RACKS THERE HAS HOWEVER BEEN NO EARTHQUAKE OF CONSE QUENCE DURING THESE LAST THREE MONTHS MY CONJECTURE THAT THE VOLCANIC MATTER WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE OCCASIONED THE LATE EARTHQUAKES HAD VENTED ITSELF AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA BETWEEN CALABRIA AND SICILY SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN VERIFIED FOR THE PILOT OF ONE OF HIS SICILIAN MAJESTYS SCIABECQUES HAV ING SOME TIME AFTER THE EARTHQUAKES CAST ANCHOR OFF THE POINT OF PALIZZI WHERE HE HAD OFTEN ANCHORED IN TWENTYFIVE FATHOM WATER FOUND NO BOTTOM TILL HE CAME TO SIXTYFIVE FATHOM AND HAVING SOUNDED FOR TWO MILES OUT AT SEA TOWARDS THE POINT OF SPARTIVENTO IN CALABRIA HE STILL FOUND THE SAME CONSIDERABLE ALTERATION IN THE DEPTH OF THE SEA THE INHABITANTS OF PALIZZI LIKEWISE DECLARE THAT DURING THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE OF THE 5TH OF FEBRUARY 1783 THE SEA HAD FROTHED AND BOILED UP TREMEN DOUSLY OFF THEIR POINT E X P L AD I A P L O O  S I PORTO 100 200 300 400

principally concerning Tounn sites and lGcltive Population By Captain W J GRANT FRGS C Read December 12 18 5 9 VANCOUVER ISLAND is in itself so unproduetive in proportion to its extelltS that its rise or fall as an important eolony must in a great degree depend on the support whieh it reeeives from the neigll bouring continent Soal or earen gold in its rocks or fish in its seas will seareely be found to attract perluanently the settlement of a large population if eorn and eattle for their subsistenee are wanting In fixing therefore on the site for its prineipal town eonvenienee of eomlnunieation with the baek eountry of British Columbia should be had in view at the same tilne not losing sight of facility of intereourse with the outer world Neither of these desiderata are as it would appear to me found in the site of Vietoria nor n7ere they indeed contemplated when that site mras first fixed upon The few Canadians and Orkneymen who some dozen years ago undel the able guidanee of Mr Finlayson first planted there the row ot palisades sillce dignified by the name of a fort little dreamt of the brilliant future whieh was awaiting the spot they had ehosen The eonsiderations which aetuated their leaders were if I mistake not the follovving1st a safe and sheltered harbour for vebssels of small tonnage 2nd a well disposed tribe of Indians 3rd a situation convenient for intercollrse with Nisqually and with suffi cient open land near it whereon to form a farm for the sllbsistence of the servants of the establishment The bare idea of such a vessel as the Leviathalz being even talked of as being likely to be sent to their harbour would have probably eaused them to stand as much aghast as if the extinet monster whose name she bears had himself been borne in upon their vies riding on the swell of the Paeifie Nor did they I suspect contemplate the probability of any gold ever being seen in that loeality unless sueh as was im ported by or for the Sompany Suceess in trade and that within a very contracted sphere formed the boundary of their highest aspirations Now however the ease is nltered more mouths are to be fed more eommeree to be fostered more ships to be received the wandering rays of British empire have at length penetrated to this distant eolony and the gloom of a savage region may hope to be illuminated by the sun of civilization The isand must be poor indeed if under sueh a state of things it eannot produee a better site for a ehief city than the shores of Vietoria  See Arrowvsmiths Map of Vancouver Island in vol

impassable to vessels drawing over 20 feet of water once entered nunlerous cS structions of rocks and banks render the chanllel tortuous and unsafe without a pilot the smallest schooner has to tack three times before arrivirg at the quay and when arrived there i e ill the most spacious part of the harbour six large vessels would with difficulty find convenient room for anchorage at the same time Again the supply of water is bad none is procurable in the harbour itself and the crews of vessels have either to go br a considerable distance up the arm or to send boats round to the harbour of Esquimalt Proceeding on land here again the supply of water is indiSerent timber fittfor building purposes is scarce and the surface close to the sea is broken rocky and irregular Leaving now the locality of Victoria if the reader will take a sail with me through the canal de Arro he will find himself in a few hours in the harbour of Sanetch some forty miles distant Sanetch is a long arm of the sea thoroughly sheltered with deep water few obstructions and good anchorage though at a somewhat long length of chaill It is almost immediately opposite the mouth of Frazers River at which place its natives OWll a fishillgground on its shores is a pentiful supply of tiluber of a11 sorts near it is sufficient open land to begin with and into it flows the Cowitshin the largest river yet known on the islanda river also which flows through the largest known extent of open land and that land with high agricul tural capabilities Thus far in search of a townsite in connexion with the newlydiscovered gold regions Let us see however whether Vancouver Island cannot likewise support a town on her own resources and if the reader will kindly now turn back with me and proceed along the south coast of the island I will try and direct his search Passing Victoria as already disposed of anl casling a glance at Esquimalt as somewhat rnore desirable we arrive at Bucher Bay which has nothing to attract us i and shortly after glide past Soke with a sigh of regret that so beautiful a sheet of water as is presented by its harbour should contain so matly villainous rocks and shoals and that the large extent of ground Oll its shores should comprise so little availalle land From thence we hurry on to Port St Juan which though best situated is neither sufficiently large nor sufficiently well sheltered we at length drop anchor permanently in Barclay Sound  erroneously called Nittinat ESere the first thing is to discover the Alberni Canal which though I did not find it where 1 looked for it no doubt is to be met with in solne part of the Sound The Indians who accoirlpanied my search in a canoe and who hailed from Chadukutl ignored its existence when I returned however to my schooner which lay near the entrance of the Sound Klayshin an Upat seachief declared tElat in the country of the Cojuklesatach i e towards the northwest VOL XXXI P210 GRANTS RemarEs 071 Vancouver Island corner of the Sound after paddling during two suns and once svhile the moon gilded the stroke of your paddles you arrived at a district called Nomatah where on a hillside coal was found in abundance and cropping out from the surface of the earth I regret that the springing up of a favourable breeze which carried me away on my voyage southX prevented my testing the truth of the communication thus made to me by the savage This Nomatah if his tale be true must be situated on a navigable stream some 80 miles up in the interior and at the head of the navigation for large vessels of this stream or canal would I should fancy be the best situation fbr the cornmercial capital of Vancouver Island The banks of a stream which could be navigable so far are probably somewhat level and if level there is every possibility of these comprising a considerable extent of available land Surely the noble expanse of Barclay Sound some 10 miles broad at the entrance and reaching for a still greater distance into the illterior which may be easily made in all weathers and to which vessels attempting to make the Straits of Fuca are sometimes carried against their will by a Ilorthwest current would furnish a more fitting terminatioll to a long seavoyage than is presellted by the comparatively insignificant little port of Victoria 7 and the latter place does not possess sufficient other local advantages to compensate for the fflrand vital defect of beint a  statio male fida carinis Besides Barclay Sound Clayoquot and Nootka both furnish better harbours than any to be met with on the Straits of Fuca and it has yet to be seen whether their neighbourhoods do not also possess other advantages One word in conclusion con cerning the native population Poor creatures  their future presents a sufficiently miserable prospect the grating of the chaincable wilen the anchor frorn the bows of the white mans ship first seeks a restingplace on their land sounds their dootn and generally at no distant period A11 attempts at amalgamation have hitherto failed it does not seem good that their race shollld mix with that of the white man or even that it should coexist therewith They are not like the monarch of Israel given the choice of the calamity by which they are to be annihilated but famine sword and pesti lence alike pursue them The salmon on which they relied for subsistence is caught by the white man and by him pickled and exported the camass on which they almost equally relied is exter minated as a noxious weed Rum and the rifle are not backward in doing their allotted tasks nor is the pestilence of the destroying angel wanting to complete the sum of their fate The hope of the missionary and of the philanthropist mayS indeed tell a more flattering tale but is it likely to be realized Where the white man settles there the red man disappears  The noise of their sorlgs shall cease unless the Almighty Ruler of the Universe sees fit to alter the hitherto prevailing laws in such cases Let him whoGRANTS RemarAs on Vclncouver Island 211 doubts me take a trip across the Atlantic let him land at New York and proceed across the entire continent of America going up the Hudson and down the Columbia He will find in both Eastern and CisWestern States the aboriginal red man entirely extinct on the plains a few Pawnees and Sioux may cross his path in the Rocky Mountains the Crows and Blackfeet will fly before him near the head waters of the Columbia the noble PendOreilles who never turn back to friend or foe may thinly show themselves further on the subtle Snake who shows he has not forgotten to sting and anon the wily horsetaming Cayoux and the Clike tat skilled to draw the bow Thus in a journey of some 4000 miles he may llave seen perhaps 300 red men and had the whole native population which lined his path presented them seves to his view he might have seetl 17000 souls of whom the Sioux would be by far the most numerous and the Cliketats the least On the lower waters of the Columbia they are almost as extinct as on the banks of the Hudson Their habitation has been made desolate though they be sought for yet shall they never be found again Their villages have become a place to spread nets upon and the call for the names of a hundred tribes is answered alone by the westerly wind as passing through their leafy tombs it whistles mournfully their coronach In Vancouver Island the native population is numerous the number of males is from 12000 to 17000 they are attached to their hereditary pos sessions and though quiet as long as there is room for both races it may not be so when the white population betins to jostle them When the Cowitshin are driven from their huntinggrounds and the Clayoquotoch from their fisheries some struggle may be antici pated buying the land will not suffice as long as the rascals  cumber the face of the earth Small as the progress is which has been made by the missionary in cultivating Christian virtues and kindly feelings among the dark men of the East still less successful has he been with the children of the West The nature of the red man is savage and perverse He prefers war to peace noise to quiet dirt to cleanliness and jugglery to religion It should be a question for Government to consider whether it may not be desirable to send at once to guard against any contingencies that may arise a battalion of one of Her lMajestys regiments from Canada one Willg of which should be permanently stationed on the island and the other sent to the opposite mainlanel When a generation shall be passed no doubt a local corps may with advantage be raised But however desirable it may be to inculcate upon colonies the ad vantages of selfreliance proper assistance should not be withheld from them in their early stages they must be protected in infancy in order that they may be able to take care of themselves in maturity In this the United States who on other occasions are apt enough to P 2212 GRANTS Remarks on Vancouver Island guess that their eitizens ean take eare of themselves set us a good example In California in Oregon asld in Washington territory soldiers of the Government were among the first arrivals they eonsisted of rifles and artillery or rather artillerymen for the latter had left tlleir gUllS behind them in some more favoured region It would not I think be judieious to send a regiment or part of a regiment at once into the aetual mining listrict it is not fair to expose the soldiers to so great and injurious a temptation Besides the mining populatioll leading as they do an irregular life alld being almost invariably armed readily organize theluselves or are easily organized into selfprotecting communities The materials for poliee and for more active forces are always to be found from their ranks without mueh detriment to the due earrying on of other pursuits Not so with a pastoral eommereial or agrieultural eom munity to have to pursue robbers and ehastise enesnies interferes with their daily avoeations It is more desirable that they should have among them a body of men who haxe nothing else to do but to eat their bread and to provide for the safety and for the seeurity cf those who raise or import it The nations of these eountries are it is true at present quiet The oceurrenee of late events in the territories of the United States and in our own Hindostan have however suffieiently proved that the spirit of a native population whether eneased in a red or in a blaek kin is not to be trusted Nor is it alone for reasons of internal policy that troops are required in Vaneouver Islalld a Scylla frowns from Sitka and a Charybdis yawns at Olympia we migllt fall upon the one in trying to avoil the other and althouth rlo present danger threatens from either it is quite desirable to take precautions aainst both the land of Vaneouver Island is rieh as a rule though in the aggregate it is not profitable to oeeupy as on the greater part of it no land at all is found and the settler must be content if he takes his ehancen to find at least tmTothirds of his allotment little better thall bare rock Ihe extent of rieh or cultivable land is thus ex trelnely limited and the timber of the woodland is so inferior to what is found on the neighbouring coastsS that tlle principal resourees of the island must I think be said to be the mineral wealth of its roeks and the fisheries of its seas The latter if properly developeel might be made extremely profitable the fish if eaught and cured under European superintendence and with European means might be exported profitably to Australia where salmon and herring are both in demand and the two distant extremities of the British empire might thus be made to join hands with mutual benefit to each other f minerals coal is the only one which has as yet been profitably urorked The eoalfields are extensive those at Nanaimo are the most favourably situated for export and are also very easily worked and drained there are many other eoalfields also in the islandXGRANTS Remarks on Vancouver Island 213 whieh in eourse of time when means of eommllnieation are opened out may no doubt be worked to advantage It is not probable that gold will be foutld in Vaneollver Island in any quantities sufEeient to repay the vvorking of it and although there are some runlours on the subjeet I am inelined to doubt its having as yet been found at all in the island Gold is found in quartz or on granite and other primary and metamorphie roeks never in any other roek than quartz nor lying on roeks of a seeondary formation I think it therefore extremely doubt ful that the report should be true of any gold having been fouIld near Vietoria or in any of the low distriets of the island where the soil is in general a black vegetable mould supported ox a subsoil of eold yellow elay many yards in depth and resting on sandstone of the coal formation There is little quartz in the hills of Vaneouvel Island the valleys slope too steeply and where rivers exist they rush through their roekbolmd ehannels too im petuously to allow the acneurilulation of any auriferous deposit either on their banks or on bars I han7e not seen anywhere the sintular red eompaet earth whieh is the invariable eoneomitant of all auriferous superfieial deposits Goll is however found in large masses in the quartz of Queen Charlotte Islands mThieh probably ates ago formed a COlltillUOUS range with the hills of Vancouver Ihere ean be little doubt that it exists in the

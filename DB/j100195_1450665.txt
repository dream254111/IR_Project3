j100195,The Jewish Quarterly Review,1450665,An Ancient Booksellers Catalogue,i263164,THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW AN ANCIENT BOOKSELLERS CATALOGUE AMONG the Adler Genizah Fragments from Fostat is the following Booksellers List which is evidently not later in date than the beginning of the twelfth century It is intrinsically of considerable importance because it intro duces us to a large number of unknown works by known writers Two similar lists from the same collection have been published by Professor Bacher in the Revue des ttudes Juqves Une Vieille Liste de Livres XXXTX 199 et seqq La Bibliotheque dun Medecin Juif XL 5562  Neither of these lists however is as important as the one under consideration in respect to the number or interest of its volumes Most of these are described as  bound  it but already centuries ago our unnamed bibliographer prized his Genizah Fragments and bound them up as Miscellanies prtnin i5 bijD DnW tEmDl I  iiJ nDiN Ol7N Ip 2 8iiD p nii p w1 naD 3 tSin

other Christian worthies are referred to in the book so that it could not be earlier than the end of the ninth century At the date of our catalogue the book was obviously well known Among the Adler

Samuel the  Master probably the Nagid Ibn Nagrela It is just possible that the author was the Nagids son and successor Joseph who was executed at Granada in 1066 and the Catalogue may have been written shortly after this date when it was dangerous to mention the name of the fallen Vizier or to call Samuel by his title of Nagid In the Adler collection there is a long and curious letter to this same Joseph Hanagid with every eulogy on his Jewish learning and Gentile influence 24 A Commentary on the four latter prophets by Jehuda ibn Bileam who flourished ca 1070 Derenbourg published

rational and traditional explanation of the ten sephiroth by David Ben Mervan al Makamez al Raki In the name of God the Master of the Universe It is written He God will embrace me with the kisses of his mouth for his love is stronger than passion for wineAN ANCIENT BOOKSELTERS CATALOGUE The author commences by saying Blessed be God the God of Israel the only One the Eternal who hath created out of nought the chief things existing He who teaches to man that by which he may attain eternal salvation May he be glorified and sanctified beyond the power of his creators Verily if we have commenced by citing this verse it is because it presents an analogy with the principal object of this treatise In effect it is a homage to that which is evidenced by the souls healthy and sick alike and certified by intelligence exempt from infirmity that God is one and that he hath no rival who can dispute sovereignty with him nor any antagonist who could have the power to deprive him of his might His Unity demonstrates that he is eternal and that he has created all which exists and the Scripture pronounced that this is so With regard to his Unity is the word of Scripture And there is none beside him and there is no God besides him As to his having no rival it is the text I am God and there is no other God and none like unto me and again And there is no God with me As to his having no antagonist who could deprive him of his strength or dispute his sovereignty with him then the text And he shall say unto me what doest thou 1  70 A bound volume of letters 7I TheWork of Chivi Al

Lambert says  Ce titre sappliquerait fort bien aux fragments que M Harkavy et moi avons publies Probably Saadia himself made a commentary on his Sefer Hagaluy in the same way as Moses b Ezra did with the P3I D vide ante 51 and the fragments extant are more likely to belong to this commentary than to its text This fact perhaps accounts for some of the difficulties which Mr Margoliouth has felt In

undoubted author Saadia The Sefer Hagaluy itself would seem to be an anonymous and somewhat mystical work by Saadia The Tafsir however was more precise and more controversial and has therefore in part at least survived its subject If this theory be correct there would be no difficulty in explaining Raabads ignorance of its true authorship Further notes on this Catalogue will be offered in a later

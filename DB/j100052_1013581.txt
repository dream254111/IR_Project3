Western Electric Company Chicago During the past few years the application of scientific analy sis to the problem of industrial management has occupied the attention of many companies This analysis has been largely directed to the solution of the problem as it was affected by the factors of materials processes and equipment and while it has been recognized that the study of the human element is at least as important as the other elements involved comparatively little analysis of this factor has been attempted in comparison with the thought and study directed to the others It is evident from the articles written in the last two or three years and from the general interest now apparent that considerable thought is being given to the man problem and it is hoped that the description of employ ment methods and records which follows may be of assistance to those interested As many of the records of employes at work are those originated at the time of employment it has seemed advisable to explain somewhat in detail the employment routine While there are some minor differences between the methods and in the forms used in employing shop employes and office employes for the sake of simplicity this description will cover the methods and forms used in the employment of shop employes only It was considered advisable in laying out the employment department to divide the applicants into four main divisions shop men shop women office men and office women and the layout of this department which follows shows how the arrangement of the department accomplishes the separation desired and also indicates the line of travel for each class of applicant RECORDS The Hiring of Employes When additional help is required by any department a requisi tion form 256 GN is sent by the department

determine his general fitness for any of the positions which are to be filled If he seems to meet the require ments or is a desirable prospective he is requested to fill out an application blank form 213 GN After filling out this blank he returns to the interviewer who carefully scrutinizes the application blank and by questioning the applicant endeavors to determine his ability to fill the position which is vacant On certain classes of skilled help it has been thought desirable to have the department head finally interview the applicant before assigning him to the position vacant and in these cases the applicant is sent to the department head with the application blank and form H W 1255 enclosed in the pass envelope form H W 1405 By means of this pass envelope the applicant can be properly directed to the department by the police officers of the works If the applicant is satisfactory to the department head he so indicates it on form H W 1255 and returns the applicant to the

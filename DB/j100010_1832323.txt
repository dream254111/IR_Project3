j100010,The American Historical Review,1832323,The Execution of the Duc DEnghien II,i304838,THE EXECUTION OF THE DUC DENGHIEN II ON March I2 two days after he had ordered the Duc dEnghien to be seized the First Consul retired to the quiet and seclusion of Malmaison to unravel without interruption the last threads of the plot against his life and to direct at the same time from a little distance the vengeance which he was determined to take upon all those whom he imagined connected with it It was there as we have seen that he received the courier Thibaud announcing that the ar rest was about to be made and in reply sent orders that Enghien and Dumouriez were to be brought to Paris at once It was from Malmaison also that he wrote the letter to Real which has been cited above in which he told him to inquire of the commandant of Vincennes whether there was room to lock up the prisoners in that castle This letter to Real proves that already on March I 5 even before he had heard that the Duc had actually been arrested Bona parte had made up his mind to send him to Vincennes instead of to the Temple where Moreau and Georges were and where state prisoners were ordinarily confined He had further made up his mind and this is the heaviest charge against Bonaparte and the one for which history will censure him most severely that the Duc dEnghien should not have the fair open trial at Paris which justice and the law naturally accorded to a man accused of political con spiracy Instead he was secretly handed over to a courtmartial on the very night of his arrival in Paris given a trial which outraged the name of justice and sent to his death at once Why did Bona parte thus basely deny to the Duc dEnghien the fair trial which was granted to Georges and his comrades  Because he knew Georges was a guilty man and would justly be convicted in a fair trial but did not feel that the same was true of the Duc There were many reasons which made him regard it as doubtful whether the regular tribunal at Paris could be induced to convict him The violation of the electoral territory would furnish the Ducs advocates with an easy and strong line of defence which would be backed up by the foreign diplomatic agents Then again as Cambaceres had IBonaparte to Real March I5 supra Vol III pp 639 640  2I 22 S B Fay suggested public opinion in Paris always fickle and uncertain might turn in the Ducs favor and prevent his being put to death A few days later Bonaparte publicly declared  I ordered the prompt trial and execution of the Duc dEnghien in order that the emigres who had returned to Paris and who in their hearts might have favored a change in favor of the Bourbons might not be led into temptation I feared that the long delays of a trial and the solem nity of condemnation might revive sentiments they could not have refrained from exhibitinlg and I should have been obliged to hand them over to the Police very kind and thoughtful to be sure on the part of the First Consul He further feared especially after he had read the Ducs papers and saw how little there really was in them to convict him that the regular course of justice with its slow and measured procedure which fairly examined and weighed all evidence would never sentence the Duc to death If his victim escaped from his hands after all he would have already violated international law to no purpose he would have given the Bourbons and their followers a triumph anda point on which he was always sensitivehe would have made a false step and exposed himself to the censure of Paris and the ridicule of Europe This was the reason for which he had determined to send the Duc before a courtmartial of military officers This tribunal owed its origin to terrible times having been fashioned by the Con vention to execute its vengeance Its judgments were executed within twentyfour hours there was no appeal from them There was little likelihood that the Duc dEnghien would leave its clutches unharmed The diplomatic agents would not intervene and pro test nor could public opinion be roused to save the unhappy man for he would be executed before the public knew anything about it The blow would be startling at first but it would live in the im agination of men for a long time as a warning As early as March I6 Bonaparte had consulted with Murat as to the composition of the military court which was to sit at Vin cennes and try the Duc dEnghien and Dumouriez2 For he was still of the opinion that Dumouriez was undoubtedly at Ettenheim and he naturally continued to think so until Saturday March I7 and even the greater part of that day until the arrival late in the afternoon of the courier from Strasburg bearing the series of reports from Caulaincourt Ordener and Charlot telling in detail of the suc cess of the expeditions to Ettenheim and Offenburg From these numerous reports it became certain that the Marquis de Thumery 1 Miot de M6lito Aklnzoires II 1567 Paris I858 2 Boulay de la Meurthe p 2IOThe Execution of the Due dEnghien 23 had occasioned the mistake about Dumouriezs name This gross blunder must have caused the First Consul some chagrin and sur prise but it would be a great mistake to suppose that his convic tions with regard to the Duc were at all disconcerted or shaken The Duc dEnghien still appeared to him to be a man of the sort of which he had already determined him to beyoung bold and in judicious just the man to take part in a conspiracy and lead an invasion of France In Charlots report Bonaparte read that it had only been the coolness of one of his companions that prevented the Duc from shooting Charlot According to the same information the Ducs opinions were not less violent than his acts The Duc dEnghien esteems Bonaparte as a great man but being a prince of the Bourbon family he has vowed an implacable hatred to him as well as to the French against whom he will make war on all occasions A man who used such language as this thought Bonaparte ought not to be left at large if it could be helped Though the supposed presence of Dumouriez at Ettenheim had contributed largely to bring about the arrest of the Duc yet on the other hand the proven absence of Dumouriez did not in Bonapartes mind in any way establish the innocence of the Duc and he must suffer It was in this frame of mind that the First Consul heard mass at the Tuileries on Passion Sunday and then returned to Malmaison Josephine being in a separate carriage with Madame de Remusat her lady in waiting was uneasy and finally confided to her com panion the cause of her unhappiness Bonaparte had just told her that the Duc dEnghien had been seized on the frontier and was be ing brought to Paris to be tried  I have done what I could she continued  to induce him to promise me that the Princes life shall not be taken but I fear his mind is made Up3 This is still one more piece of evidence tending to show that Bonaparte had from the first formed the irrevocable decision to put the Duc to death The remainder of Sunday at Malmaison passed quietly Early the next morning or possibly very late the same night a third courier arrived from Strasburg bringing to Bonaparte the Ducs papers and the procesvctbal of their opening and examination by Charlot and Popp these were the papers which had been de spatched Saturday afternoon from Strasburg Without summonirng Real or any other minister to help him Bonaparte set himself to 1 Charlots report Catastropphe du Duzc dEnghien p 232 2 Ile had come from Malmaison to Paris on Saturday to transact business it was at the Tuileries that the courier who brought Charlots report and the other news from Strasburg found him 3 Remusat Aksi I  312 Faris i88o24 S B Fay work to look over the papers His eyes fell finally upon a draught of the note which the Duc had sent to Mr Stuart to deliver to the English government two months before It laid bare the plans of the Prince and bore witness to his obstinate and persistent desire to fight against the First Consul under the English flag Two phrases especially impressed themselves upon the indignant minid of the First Consul that in which the Duc called the French people  his most cruel enemy and that in which he declared that  a residence of two years near the frontier had given him an opportunity to com municate with the troops that were on the Rhine 1 What was Bonaparte to think of such sentiments and this apparent tampering with the loyalty of French troops  Then there were not a few eager offers of service from men who had already served in the Army of Conde or other old companions of the Duc for his circu lar letter reporting Englands announcement that their pensions were to be doubled had given rise to a renewed activity in their cor respondence There were letters of this kind from Alsace from Switzerland and even from Holland full of plans and advice often wrongheaded to be sure and often incomprehensible but neverthe less containing much that a prejudiced mind could easily imagine to be treasonable Though he did not find anything to show that the Duc knew of the Cadoudal conspiracy or had any connection with Dumouriez he probably reasoned that it made no diffierence to him whether the Duc knew of the plot or not so long as he persisted in waiting upon the frontier of France for a favorable opportunity to invade Alsace such as the assassination of the First Consul would afford As the conspiracy had been known to the public now for more than a month the Duc could not lhave been ignorant of it why did he still remain within three leagues of France when he must have known that it was not safe after all that had been dis covered unless he were about to lead a hostile force into Alsace or create a rebellion there  Reasoning in this way and allowing his prejudiced mind to be influenced by apparent facts without fairly weighing both sides of the evidence Bontaparte may have tried to satisfy his conscience that his already fixed opinion of the Ducs guilt was confirmed by the Ducs owIn papers and that he ought to be put to death I Rereading the Ducs letter supra XVol III p 623 it will be seen that these are not the exact phrases that he used though the meaning is equivalent they are the phrases that Bonaparte used in the set of qluestions whiclh he prepared for Real to ask the Duc infra pp 33 34 We cannot know in most cases exactly what Bonaparte found in the Ducs papers for they have all disappeared but we may have some idea of what it was for this set of questions which Bonaparte surely did not make up out of his own head nmust have been partly at least suggested to him by what he found in the Ducs papers Wle know exactly what was in the note to Stuart because it is in the Austrian Record OfficeThe Execution of the Duc dEnghien 25 As a matter of fact there was nothing in all these papers that could justify the Ducs seizure in a neutral territory and his subse quent condemnation and execution Not only was there no proof of complicity in a plot but there was the Ducs categorical denial of such complicityhe had no other intentions than to serve in war and make war Charlot who examined the papers at Strasburg affirmed to Segur that in all the Ducs correspondence he saw no traces of any connivance with the plot at Paris he found nothing more than the proof of a gathering of emigres on the right bank of the Rhine and communications held with the left bank The Ducs plans reached back for more than two years long before the conspiracy of Georges they followed the progress of the war and not of the con spiracy there had been no definite preparation of money nor arms nor any regular organization of troops which could at all threaten the safety of the state or the First Consul That there was really no evidence against the Duc that could justly condemn him must have been recognized by Bonaparte on March I9 after the examina tion of the papers although as has just been said he may have tried to convince his conscience and always afterwards asserted in public that in executing the Duc dEnghien he was executing a guilty conspirator The proof of this is that he did not send any of these papers not even the procesverbal of the opening of the papers to the courtmartial as evidence for the use of the judges for he knew that they would not in all probability be so shameless and grossly unjust as to condemn a man to death when they saw that there was nothing in his papers to convict him What did Bonaparte do with these papers which if made public would show the people of France that the Duc dEnghien did not merit death at all but at the very worst only detention as a hostage till peace was made He sent them to Real and told him and Desmarets to keep them in absolute secrecy and not let the slightest news of what they con tained be made public2 Real obeyed his master so well that they never saw the light afterwards the judges at the trial did not know of their existence To have sent them the papers would have given rise to debates and would have necessitated the presence of a de fending lawyer and witnesses All this would have caused delay and endangered the sentence of condemnation This fear of delay and openness and Bonapartes knowledge that there was nothing very incriminating in the Ducs papers explains why they were kept IS6gur AInm II 258 2     Je vous recommande de prendre en secret avec Desmarets connaissance de ces papiers II faut empecher quil ne soit tenu aucun propos sur le plus ou moins de charges

dEnghien was drawing near Paris Bonaparte drove from Malmaison to the Tuil eries as his habit often was in order more easily to attend to affairs of state Having already made up his mind on March i 5 to send the Duc to Vincennes and on March i6 to have him tried by a courtmartial he now dictated in a Council of State the followingr decree Article L The cidevant Duc dEnghien accused of having borne arms against the Republic of having been and still being in the pay of England and of taking part in the plots woven by this latter power against the interior and exterior safety of the Re public is to be brought before a courtmartial composed of seven members named by the Governor of Paris and sitting at Vincennes Article II The Grand Judge the Minister of War and the Governor of Paris are charged with the execution of the present decree  BONAPARTE 1 In accordance with this decree Murat Governor of Paris clhose the seven members of the courtmartial Bazancourt Ravier Bar rois Rabbe Guiton colonels of regiments garrisoned in Paris and in addition to these five General Hulin an ardent patriot who had assisted at the taking of the Bastille was chosen to act as president of the courtmartial and Dautancourt major of gendarmes as judgeadvocate capitainerapporteur These seven men in order that everything concerning the Duc might be done as secretly as possible and no rumors get abroad before the deed was completed did not receive notice from the Minister of WNTar to go to Murats house till late in the afternoon They came immediately one by one to Murat and each was told that he was to form part of a court martial which is to meet as soon as possible at Vincennes to judge there without leaving the spot an accused man oni the charges given in a decree of the government which will be sent to the president 2 They thereupon betook themselves separately to XVincennes each wondering who the accused might be but with not the faintest idea that it was a Bourbon prince On Tuesday afternoon about five oclock that is just after he had received notice that the Duc was at the barrier of Paris Bona lArchives nationales AFIV 9I5 quoted by Welschinger p 313 2 1   Cette

brigade of troops from Paris to Vincennes guard the place and execute the decision of the courtmartial which he would find there But as Murat was governor of Paris and of the troops stationed there Savary was also given a letter from the First Consul which he was to deliver to Murat Murat read the letter and may have given Savary some further directions about the troops of which he was to have charge Bonaparte had chosen Savary for this mission because he knew of his devotion to himself and because he knew that he would have no scru ples in executing the decision of the courtmartial without delay Savary arrived at Vincennes about eight oclock in the evening and having stationed his troops around the chateau saw the seven mem bers of the courtmartial arrive separately By eleven oclock these eight men had gathered around the fire in Harels room with them was Brunet Murats aidedecamp who had just arrived with the gov ernments decree of accusation Everything being now ready Ma jor Dautancourt went into the next room where the Duc dEnghien was sleeping soundly and waked him for a preliminary examina tion It has often been supposed that Bonaparte intended that Real who had seen the Ducs papers and was fully acquainted with the whole affair should be present at the trial and guide the judge advocate Dautancourt in his work 2 for Real knew something 1 Savary in I823 actuated by a feeling of spite and a desire to heap calumny on ev ery one else who had been in any way connected with the Enghien affair in order to draw attention away from his own share in the matter accuses Murat of having given him the or ders about taking the troops to Vincennes in accordance with the directions just received in the letter from Bonaparte He says that he did not even know when he left Mal maison that the Duc had been seized nor what was contained in the letter of which he was the bearer But Pasquier I 204 seq and the recently published notes of the Comte de Mosbourg in Murat Lieutenant de PEnipereur en Espagne Paris I897 pp 437445 leave no doubt that Savary as his whole later conduct tends to show was car rying out the will of his master the First Consul and had got his orders from him and not merely from Murat He probably knew too the contents of the lettet which Pas quier p 204 says contained the most formal orders not only to have the Duc tried and sentenced but not to suffer any delay to occur in his execution and to anticipate all preparations It was only in consequence of this second peremptory order from Bona parte that Murat was finally forced to give the order for the assembly of the military com mission to sit at Vincennes and judge the prisoner sans desemparer For on that same Tuesday morning when the first message came to him about eleven oclock from Bonaparte asking him to appoint the men for the military commission he indignantly re fused exclaiming  What are they trying to soil my uniform I will not tolerate such a thing Let him Bonaparte appoint them himself if he wants to Bonaparte ac cordingly did so Pasquier 1 206 also completely confirmed in detail by Comte de Mosbourgs note 2 As a civilian R4al could have taken no formal part in the proceedings of a court martial but he could of course have been present and made suggestions to Dautan court20 S B Fay about legal forms while Dautancourt did not and Real knew the points which might best be brought up against the accused This question is discussed below for the present it is enough to say that Real was not at Vincennes and Dautancourt was left to blunder along as best he could The only two documents that he had to guide him in interrogating the Duc were I Murats order that the courtmartial should try the accused without leaving the spot and 2 the decree of the government which charged the Duc with three things with having borne arms against the Republic with being in the pay of England and with taking part in the Cadoudal conspiracy The j udgeadvocate considered this decree as his guide and contented himself with asking the Duc some needless questions on these three points which were answered frankly and explicitly by the Duc That he was an emigre aad had fought in the Army of Conde was a fact well known to Dautancourt and all who were acquainted with the revolutionary wars In answer to the second charge the Duc said he did receive money from England but it was as a pension which was given him as his only means of support and not as wages for serving England in war Lastly he disdainfully repudi ated the idea that he could have had anything to do with a con spiracy He declared that he had never seen Pichegru nor Du mouriez nor had the slightest relations with them he was glad that he had not if it was true that they had used the vile means which were reported He said that he corresponded with his father and grand father in England and with some old friends in France not on political projects but solely on personal matters2 The judge advocate thinking that he had asked enough for forms sake re quested the Duc to sign the procesverbal of the answers he had just given for by French law his own evidence is read to the accused and he signifies his admission that it is correctly reported by signing the document The Duc wrote Before signing this procesverbal I earnestly request that I may have an interview with the First Consul My name my rank 1 It will be remembered that Bonaparte had told Real to suppress the Ducs papers A contemporary account of the proceedings says that Hulin  had the prisoner led in free and without handcuffs and ordered the judgeadvocate to read the documents both in favor of and against the accused to the nzmber of one This one document was the decree of the government Catastrophe du Duc dEnghien p Ioo also Welschinger 325 Savary also admits Mbnoires II 394 that Hulin could produce only one document the decree of the govemment against the Duc but that this was all that was necessary more or less evidence would have made no difference in the result because Hulin when chosen president of the commission was given to understand that the accused must be condemned 2Dupins pamphlet on the trial printed in Catastrophe du DuC d Anghien also Appendix V of Scotts Life of NapoleonThe Execution of the Duc dEnghien 29 my way of thinking and the horror of my situation lead me to hope that he will not refuse my request  L A H de Bourbon When the interrogatory was thus completed the prisoner was brought unshackled into the room where the courtmartial was sit ting ready to perpetrate an atrocious crime in the name of Justice It was a little after midnight The light of a few flaring torches fell across the faces of the seven ministers of death Brunet Murats aidedecamp stood at one side Savary like a vulture waiting for its prey hovered ominously behind the chair of the president eager to prevent any delay or hesitation on the part of the judges That the trial took place in the secrecy of night was in itself irregular But this was by no means the only irregularity and in justice of the proceedings By military law the prisoner was en titled to a copy of the charges the services of a defending advocate and sufficient time to prepare his defence all these necessary rights were denied him There were no witnesses nor was there any evi dence worthy of the name Still worse according to Hulins own admission neither he nor any of the other members of the court knew anything about law and judicial procedure they owed their position merely to what they had done on the field of battle they had not la moindre notion en matitre dejugernens 1 The mockery of forms which now followed outrages the name of a judicial trial it consisted simply of a crossexamination of the Duc from his own answers to the interrogations just put to him by Dautancourt He proudly repeated what he had already said repudiating the charge of having directly or indirectly taken part in a plot to assassinate the First Consul he acknowledged that he had upheld the rights of his family and said that a Conde could enter France only with arms in his hand  My birth and my opinions will always make me the enemy of your government he added with such unneces sary boldness inspired by a feeling of pride in his ancestors and complete confidence in his own innocence that Hulin said warn ingly  From the way you answer you seem to be mistaken as to your real position take care this will become serious and court martials give judgments from which there is no appeal The Duc was silent for a moment then he raised his head and said  I know it I ask only to have an interview with the First Consul 2 The crossexamination concluded the prisoner was led out IHulins Explications offertes aux hommes impartiaux in Catastrophe du Duc dEnghien p II8 2 Hulins Explications p 12030 S B Fay again and the court deliberated in secret as to the sentence One exceptional circumstance in the trial well justified delay this was the request of the Duc for an interview with the First Consul One of the judges Barrois was in favor of granting the request but Hu lin who the evening before had had a long conference with Bona parte and knew well that a sentence of death and a speedy execution were expected by him was opposed to granting the request the other judges also favored an immediate sentence in accordance with Murats order that they were to complete their work  sans desem parer Savary was consulted as knowing better than any one else the intentions of Bonaparte he represented that such a delay would be  inopportune and displeasing to the First Consul2 The hint was sufficient and the judges decided that the Duc should be con demned to death without delay It remained only to write the sentence But this was no easy matter for the main charge that of complicity in the conspiracy was not only unproved by any evi dence but was directly denied by the Ducs clear statement In writing out the sentence this idea of complicity in the plot had to be omitted and the judges taking the Ducs answer as a basis tried to draw up a sentence which could fit the facts and yet make the Duc liable to the penalty of death Many drafts were made before they got one that they thought would do According to the regular form the sentence ought to mention the exact law under which the ac cused was found guilty The judges had an idea that there was some revolutionary law which condemned to death emigres who had fought against their country but they were quite ignorant of its exact wording or where to find it3 To look it up would be a work 1R6musat Memoires I 323 Savary also distinctly asserts Aflmoires II 399 that Hulin some years later in exile at Brussels when questioned about his conduct in the Enghien affair said  I only acted in consequence of the most severe instructions The possibility that the Duc would demand an interview with the First Consul was fore seen and I was forbidden to allow such a demand to be presented to the government The truth of the last part of this statement of Sabvary is doubtful 2 Hulins Explications p II9 3The law they were thinking of was that of 25 Brumaire An III tit 5 sect I art 7 which provided that migres who have borne arms against France shall be arrested whether in France or in any hostile or conquered country and judged within twentyfours etc But the Duc was neither arrested in France nor within the precincts of any hostile or conquered country but was seized by force illegally in a coun try in friendly relations with France so that this law was not applicable to him Even had he been arrested in a hostile country it would have been unjust and ridiculous to sentence him to death on the ground of this law for it had long been a dead letter it was no longer looked upon as a crime to have fought against France from 1792 to I799 the revolutionary war was a thing of the past the great mass of 6migr6s had been am nestied it was part of Bonapartes wise policy to encourage exiles to return and many of the old soldiers of Conde were now in the ranks of the French army or had become ornaments of the consular courtThe Execution of the Duc dEnghien 3I of some difficulty and cause delay It was necessary that the Duc should be found guilty and executed immediately unless they wished to incur the displeasure of the First Consul It would therefore be time enough after the Duc was dead and buried to consider un der what law he had suffered and to fill out the blanks accordingly One would have thought civilized men could not be guilty of such an act but here is the judgment to speak for itself The prisoner was led out the court having deliberated with closed doors and the president having collected the votes of the members beginning with the youngest and voting himself last the prisoner was unan imously found guilty and in accordance with article blank of the law blank to the following effect blank was condemned to suffer death Ordered that the judgeadvocate see that the present sen tence is executed immediately This was signed by the seven judges though not by the clerk as it ought to have been Then if we are to believe Hulins statement the judges were a little ashamed of the base piece of work they had done and all agreed that Hulin should write a letter to Bonaparte telling him of the Ducs request for an interview and begging him to remit a sentence which the rigor of our position did not allow us to avoid At this moment Savary approached Hulin and seeing what he was doing snatched away the pen saying Your part is over the rest belongs to me2 The Duc was awaiting the decision of the court in the next room without fear and even without impatience when Harel entered with a troubled face and motioned him to follow After a few steps they emerged into the open court and saw by the flickering light of torches that they were face to face with a squad of soldiers whom Savary had drawn up An adjutant advanced and read the sen tence to the Duc who heard it with firmness and selfpossession He asked for a priest but this was denied him Ever thoughtful of her who was to mourn so much for him he asked for a pair of scissors cut off a lock of his hair slipped off his ring and gave them with a note to an officer who promised to deliver them to the Princess de Rohan The squad of soldiers advanced The Duc begged them above all things not to miss their aim He bent his head in prayer a moment and commended his soul to his Maker He looked up again bravely into the mouths of the loaded muskets An instant later the shots rang out and the innocent man fell dead shot through the heart IDupins pamphlet in Catastrophe duL Duc dEnghzien lO1 also in App V of Scotts Life of Napoleon 2 Hulins Explications p 123 also Pasquier I 20132 S B Fay A few steps away was a hole which had been dug in the ground the day before in accordance with Harels orders whether he in tended it as a grave knowing that the Duc would surely be shot or whether it was merely to put some rubbish in as was said twelve years later by the man who dug it is uncertain Into this hole the Duc was pitched with all his clothes on his feet higher than his head2 and the earth was thrown in again The death and burial took place by torchlight between three and four oclock in the morning3 Thus the trial and execution were both in the dark and secrecy of night and were marked by the same unseemly haste and cruel injustice that characterized all the First Consuls orders for the destruction of an unfortunate man whose crime as Savary himself acknowledged consisted in his being the Duc dEnghien What was the account given to Paris of the proceedings of the courtmartial  They were too disgraceful to be told all that ap peared in the Monziteucr the next morning was a copy of the judg ment supposed to have been rendered4 This however was not the shameful sentence of death full of blanks and irregularities which was to be executed de suite and under which the Duc had really been sent to his death For when Real brought a copy of that outrageous document to Bonaparte he saw that it would never do to make it public5 Instead he took as a basis the ques tions that he had sent to Real and wrote out a new indictment and sentence which differed wholly from the real judgment6 This new copy which was the one published in the Monitezr accused the Duc on six different grounds and found him guilty on each Several of these had absolutely no connection with the charge upon which the Duc had been arrested the rest were unsupported by evidence as l Bourrienne II 269 asserts positively that Harel told him he had received orders the day before the execution to have a grave dug ready for the corpse 2 He was so found twelve years later when his body was exhumed and given a de cent burial in the chapel at Vincennes The account of the exhumation and of the evi dence taken at that time is given in Catastrophe du Duc dEnghien pp 301324 3 This is proved by an extant letter from Hulin to a friend quoted by Welschinger p 339 S6gur also relates that he met

 Le Premier Consul sera furieux But Savary hav ing undertaken to see Bonaparte first Real turned his carriage around and followed at a little distance fearful of the reception which he would meet2 Savary arrived at Malmaison was at once ushered into the First Consuls study and related in a few words what had been done3 On hearing that the Duc had asked to see him the First Consul interrupted him to ask what had become of Real and whether he had not gone to Vincennes Hearing that he had not he remained silent walking up and down his library with his hands crossed behind his back till Real appeared After lis tening to the latters explanation he fell again into a reverie then without expressing a word either of approval or blame he re marked It is well and marched off upstairs leaving Savary and Real in surprise and doubt The night before the trial Bonaparte had written a letter to Real telling him to go at once to Vincennes and ask the Duc dEnghien certain questions of which the most important were 4 i Have you borne arms against your country 2 Have you been in the pay of England 4 Have you not had communication with the English and placed yourself at their disposal     and have you not so far 1 It is a significant fact that Savary did not show any concern at the consequences of his haste in the matter he evidently knew that he had done what was expected of him Pasquier

was still time to reach Vincennes before the trial if he had hurried But tired out with overwork he had gone to bed early having been waked up twice already by unimportant messages he had positively forbidden his servant to disturb him again before morn ing When the letter from Bonaparte came the servant ignorant of its real importance laid it on the table by his masters bed Happening to wake up about four oclock Real saw the letter dressed hastily and started for Vincennes but met Savary at the barrier as mentioned above when the affair was all over But although we admit that Bonaparte was acting sincerely when he wrote to Real to go to Vincennes it would be a great mistake to suppose that in so doing he intended to pardon the Duc afterwards or even intended that Real should in any way delay the sentence and execution so as to leave a chance for clemency open For as has been pointed out above the First Consuls mind was made up from the first that the Duc must die he ielt sure that the court martial would condemn him2 and he never at any time intended to thwart his own work by reversing the sentence of the courtmartial and pardoning him 3 people would laugh at him and say that he was IM6neval I 260 2  The First Consul whose mind was made up had no doubt that the Duc would be condemned M6neval I 260 3 Napoleon himself declared in answer to Sir G Cockburns inquiry whether there was any truth in the report that he had sent an order for the Ducs reprieve but that it had unfortunately arrived too late  It certainly was not true for the Duc was con demned for having conspired against France and I was determined from the first to let the law take its course respecting him in order if possible to check the frequent con spiracies Bonapartes Voyage to St Helena comprising the Diary of RearAdmiral Cockburn p 122 Boston 1833 We are inclia3ed to believe that this diary contains much or all of the unpublished memoranda which Mr G Barnett Smith says have lately

asa brake on the proceedings but for the very oppo site purpose He was to show the judgeadvocate his business and help him over any questions or difficulties that might arise unexpec tedly and he was to convince the other judges by his greater knowledge of the affair and his experience in politics that they must speedily find the accused guilty for the sake of the safety of the state That this was Bonapartes intention in sending Real is fur ther confirmed by the closing words of his letter You are to guide the public prosecutor and instruct him of the necessity of ex pediting the proceedings Reals mission was not for the sake of clemency Did Bonaparte recognize afterwards that he had made a false step and committed an unnecessary wrong  Undoubtedly yes When the fact of the Ducs innocence became more clearly estab lished from the examination of his papers from the other good re ports of him that came from Baden after the execution from the knowledge that Dumouriez had not left England and from the cir cumstance that there were no hundreds of emigres on the right bank of the Rhine it would be doing injustice to Bonapartes men tal qualities to say that he still thought his own safety or that of the state had demanded such a victim2 He must moreover have seen that it had hurt him in the estimation of the French people for the moral sense of the nineteenth century was different from that of the eighteenth and the same men who a few years before had looked with consenting approval on the events of the Reign of Terror were now alarmed at the possibility of its renewal They had hoped that in Bonaparte they had found a ruler who would secure internal peace and justice to France and they feared that they were to be disappointed in this hope Many of those nearest the First Consul had opposed his course from the outset and did not hesitate to ex press their disapproval of the deed3 The only remedy was arbitrary prohibition of all discussion and to this Bonaparte had recourse It Century January I897 P I42 The statement quoted above from Cockburns diary is exactly confirmed by the diary of John R Glover Secretary to RearAdmiral Cockburn published in Napoleons Last

S B Fay was clear that he was disappointed in the way in which France re ceived the news he had intended to produce a result diametrically oppositeto fix the blame of the Ducs death on England and the Bourbons  instead the people of France laid the blame on him Outside of France the effect of the Ducs death was still worse The news sent a shudder through all Europe the ruler of France soon to make himself Emperor was looked upon as little less than a murderer with whom the other sovereigns could have nothing in common2 For the moment to be sure the rest of Europe was unable to take any steps to retaliate senously upon the First Consul The Czar of Russia showed his strong disapproval by putting his court into mourning and sending a note to the German Diet urging that the same action be taken on account of the recent violation of the territory of Baden But he had to content himself for the pres ent with breaking off diplomatic relations with France he could find no one on the continent to join with him in declaring war Prussia remained neutral and her king silent Austria withdrew her troops from Suabia in accordance with Talleyrands demand and sent a courier to Paris to say that  she could understand cer tain political necessities Dynastic politics had therefore for the moment rendered the public expression of opinion impossible But in the autumn Russia and Austria began to draw together against the common enemy The European cabinets never forgot the reck less neglect of the rights secured by international law which Bona parte showed in the case of the Duc dEnghien a man who had acted thus would do worse there could be no peace nor safety for Europe while he ruled in France he must be continually fought against till expelled At this disapproval on the part of France and increased hatred from the rest of Europe Bonaparte was mortified and angry he saw that he had made a mistake he had put to death a man who was not guilty and it had done him harm instead of good he was expressing his true thoughts when he dictated to Meneval the statement that the death of the Duc dEnghien  hurt Napoleon in public opinion and politically was of no use to him 3 It was this same feeling of angry mortification at what he had done that led him to reproach Talleyrand so bitterly in 1809 and later I Bonaparte expressly asserted that  the death of the Duc d Enghien must be at tributed to the Comte dArtois who directed and commanded from London the assassi nation of Napoleon MWneval I 270 2 Gustavus Adolphus was only expressing the universal feeling when he sent back to the

Execution of the Duc dEnghien 37 at St Helena to try to lay the blame of the Ducs death on him and his other overzealous advisers But at other times his pride and selfpossession mastered his real feelings he would not admit that he had done a wrong which was of no use he must not let the people of France know that Napo leon Bonaparte had made a false step so he boldly and frequently declared in public that the Duc was guilty of sharing in the con spiracy against his life that he had him put to death for his own safety and that of the state The law of nature he said to Las Cases justified him in taking measures for selfdefense  I was as sailed on all sides by enemies whom the Bourbons had raised up against me Threatened with airguns infernal machines and treacherous plots of all kinds I seized the occasion to strike terror even as far as London2 And finally on his deathbed at St Helena when a maladroit attendant read from an English review a scathing account of the Ducs murder the dying mans pride and obstinate persistency in trying to make the deed seem less odious by declaring that it was a measure necessary to the safety of the state gave him strength to rise from his bed catch up his will and insert in a narrow space between the lines a defiant justification which should stand forever before the world as his last word on the subject I had the Duo dEnghien arrested and tried because it was necessary to do so for the safety the interests and the honor of the French people at a time when the Comte dArtois openly admitted that he had sixty paid assassins in Paris In like circum stances I should do so again3 In spite of these declarations dictated by a feeling of pride and unwillingness to admit a mistake there can be no doubt that the execution of the Duc dEnghien was one of Bonapartes greatest political mistakes and was one of many causes that led subsequently to his downfall4 There is much truth in the remark that Fouche is reported to have made on this sad affair It was worse than a crime it was a blunder SIDNEY B FAY 1 Las Cases VII 310337 see also in Pasquier I 2 II an anecdote which shows the anger that was aroused in Napoleon when reminded

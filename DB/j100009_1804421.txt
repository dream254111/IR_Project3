j100009,The American Economic Review,1804421,The Definition of Economics,i304568,THE DEFINITION OF ECONOMICS In hope of attracting the attention of economists to the defi nition of economics proposed in my book Enterprise and the Production Process I desire to point out a remarkable coincidence between the logical distinctions and processes by which this defi nition was obtained and those employed by Mr Herbert Spencer in distinguishing actions primarily social from other human activities To obtain my definition I started with the assumption that economics is the moral science concerned with the laws and ten dencies regulating a certain class of voluntary human actions and that its definition depends upon accurately differentiating this class from other human activities The first division of human activities is of course that between the individualistic and the cobrdinated or combined Economic activities being a sub class of the latter the problem is thus narrowed down to distin guishing economic from other coordinated or combined actions I then found this distinction to be the character of the purpose leading to the different kinds of voluntary human actions Social actions are prompted by a public purpose that is undertaken for the real or supposed good of the social group as a whole and the share of the joint benefits of the results attained that accrues to any individual member of the group is necessarily unprede termined On the other hand economic activities are pronmpted by individualistic purposes and therefore the necessary preliminary to combined economic action is a definite understanding as to what share of the product or result is to accrue to each individual voluntarily entering into the productive combination When the product is divisible this definite prearrangement as to the distri bution of the product can be effected by allotting a certain per centage to each contributor When Inot susceptible of division into percentages it is the distribution of the value of the product and not the product itself which is prearranged and as a rule is effected by the employers assuming the risk of the enterprise and awarding definite prearranged amounts of values to the other contributors to the result and keeping what is left for himself The passage in Mr Spencers writings to which I refer is as follows 1 I Herbert Spencer Sociology vol II p 244247 1898 edition D Apple ton and Company The italics are mine1913 The Definition of Economics 607 Cooperation then is at once that which cannot exist without a society and that for which a society exists    But co operation implies organization If acts are to be effectually com bined there must be arrangements under which they are adjusted in their times amounts and characters This social organization neces sary as a means to concerted action is of two kinds Though these two kinds generally coexist and are more or less interfused yet they are distinct in their origins and natures There is a spontaneous co operation which grows up without thought during the pursuit of private ends and there is a cooperation which consciously devised implies distinct recognition of public ends The ways in which the two are respectively established and carried on present marked con trasts Whenever in a primitive group there begins that cooperation wlichl is effected by exchange of serviceswhenever individuals find their wants better satisfied by giving certain products which they can make best in return for otlher products they are less skilled in making or not so well circumstanced for making there is initiated a kind of organization which then and throughout its higher stages results from endeavors to meet personal needs Division of labour to the last as at first grows by experience of mutual facilitations in living Each new specialization of industry arises from the effort of one who commences it to get profit and establishes itself by conducing in some way to the profit of others So that there is a kind of concerted action with an elaborate social organization developed by it wlhich does not originate in deliberate concert Though within the small subdivisions of this organization we find everywhere repeated the relation of em ployer and employed of whom the one directs the actions of the other yet this relation spontaneously formed in aid of private ends and continued only at will is not formed with conscious reference to achievement of public ends these are not thought of And though for regulating trading activities there arise agencies serving to adjust the supplies of commodities to the demands yet such agencies do this not by direct stimulations or restraints but by communicating infor mation wlichl serves to stimulate or restrain and further these agen cies grow up not for the avowed purpose of thus regulating but in the pursuit of gain by individuals So unintentionally has there arisen the elaborate division of labour by which production and distribution are nozw carried on that only in modern days has there come a recog nition of the fact that it has all along been arising On the other hand cooperation for a purpose immediately concern ing the whole society is a conscious cooperation and is carried on by an organization of another kind formed in a different way When the primitive group has to defend itself against other groups its mem bers act together under further stimuli than those constituted by purely personal desires             So that this kind of social organization is distinguished from the other as arising through conscious pursuit of public ends in furtherance of which individual wills are constrained first by the joint wills of the entire group and afterwards more definitely by the will of a regulative agency which the group evolves608 Frederick Barnard Hawley Sept Most clearly we perceive the contrast between these two kinds of organization on observing that while they are both instrumental to social welfare they are instrumental in converse ways That organi zation shown us by the division of labour for industrial purposes ex hibits combined action but it is a combined action which directly seeks and subserves the welfares of individuals and indirectly sub serves the welfare of society as a whole by preserving individuals Conversely that organization evolved for governmental and defensive purposes exhibits combined action but it is a combined action which directly seeks and subserves the welfare of the society as a whole and indirectly subserves the welfare of individuals by protecting the so ciety Efforts for selfpreservation by the units originate the one form of organization while efforts for selfpreservation by the ag gregate originate the other form of organization In the first case there is conscious pursuit of private ends only and the correlative organization resulting from this pursuit of private ends growing up unconsciously is without coercive power In the second case there is conscious pursuit of public ends and the correlative organization consciously established exercises coercion Of these two kinds of cooperation and the structures effecting them we are here concerned with only one Political organization is to be understood as that part of social organization which consciously carries on directive and restraining functions for public ends It is true as already hinted and we shall see presently that the two kinds are mingled in various waysthat each ramifies through the other more or less according to their respective degrees of predominance But they are essentially different in origin and nature and for the present we must as far as may be limit our attention to the last  Mr Spencers immediate purpose in these paragraphs is to differentiate coordinations with a public purpose from other co ordinations By public he intends the state or the community at large and he claiins such coordination to be primarily social But he must surely be understood as also considering as primarily social such combined actions as have for their purpose the benefit of lesser groups such as clubs trade unions etc that hardly come under the term public The thing to be noted is that he refuses to recognize as primarily social any combined activities the resulting benefit of which is not expected to accrue as an un divided whole to the group and the final distribution of which will finally be among the members composing the group in unpredetermined portions Mr Spencer indeed speaks of the excluded coordinations as social but he is careful to point out that primarily they are not social that the resulting benefits first accrue as private gains to individuals and that society is affected only secondarily or in other words that human actions combined for private purposes1913 The Definition of Economics 609 while having social results are not thenmselves social That is to say such actions furnish sociological data Again while Mllr Spencer nowhere calls the combinations for private gain economic he invariably speaks of them in economic terms Neither does he listinctly assert that when private gain is the end in view the distribution of the product or of its value is always pre arranged But that he meant this is clearly evident from the fact that when the hope of private gain leading to coordination or combination is indefinite and unpredetermined the resulting action is social and not economic as when a freetrader in hope of private gain votes for a protective tariff Surely I ani not claiming too much in asserting that Mr Spencer divided human actions into three classes coinciding ex actly with my analysis of themone class of individualistic actions and two classes of cooperative actions one of which was primarily social and the other primarily economic His classifi cation and mine are in exact accord as far as they go He did not indeed assert that individualistic actions are noneconomic Consequently I cannot claim that Mr Spencer agrees with me in this particular point but it is only because he has not expressed himself And as a purely individualistic activity cannot result in an exchangeable product it is not likely he would have differed from me That Mr Spencers ideas and my own are practically identical does not of course prove that my definition of economics is the correct one but it does I think entitle it to a careful consider ation especially as its acceptance would involve no little modifi cation in the presentation of economic theory Hardly an economic treatise now exists in which instances of individualistic or social activities being treated as primarily economic cannot be found FREDERICK BARNARD

MARCH 9 1768 XI A LETTER FROM JOHN ELLIS ESQUIRE F R S TO THE PRESIDENT ON THE SUCCESS OF HIS EXPERIMENTS FOR PRESERVING ACORNS FOR A WHOLE YEAR WITHOUT PLANTING THEM SO AS TO BE IN A STATE FIT FOR VEGETATION WITH A VIEW TO BRING OVER SOME OF THE MOST VA LUABLE SEEDS FROM THE EAST INDIES TO PLANT FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR AMERICAN COLONIES H A V I N G DISCOVERED THAT THE DISAP POINTMENT WHICH I MET WITH ABOUT A YEAR AGO IN ATTEMPTING TO PRESERVE THROUGH THE SEA SON SOME EVERGREEN OAK ACORNS AND SOME CHESNUTS IN WAX WAS OWING TO THEIR BEING UNFIT FOR VEGETATION AT THE TIME OF MY INCLOSING THEM I RESOLVED IN MY NEXT ATTEMPT TO TRY ONLY SUCH AS I WAS PERSUADED WERE SOUND AND FRESH READ MARCH 10 1768 FORTUNATELY MY CURIOUS AND LEARNED FRIEND THE RIGHT HONORABLE SIR THOMAS SEWELL MASTER OF THE ROLLS HEARING OF MY DISTRESS OFFERED TO PROCURE ME SOME EXCELLENT ACORNS OF THE ENGLISH OAK PART OF A PARCEL HE HAD BEEN SOWING AT HIS SEAT AT OTTERSHAW NEAR CHERT SEY IN SURREY THESE HE WAS SO OBLIGING TO SEND ME THE 20TH OF FEBRUARY 1767 PART OF THEM I SOWED IMMEDIATELY UNDER THE WINDOWS OF MY CHAMBERS IN THE KITCHEN GARDEN OF GRAYS INN AND ON THE 22D OF THE SAME MONTH I INCLOSED ABOUT 36 OF THEM IN BEES L 2 WAX76 WAX MOST OF THOSE THAT I HAD SOWN IN THE GARDEN CAME UP IN JUNE FOLLOWING 1767 AND BY THE MIDDLE OF SEPTEMBER WERE 6 INCHES HIGH THIS GAVE ME SOME HOPES THAT I SHOULD NOT LABOUR IN VAIN AS I HAD DONE BEFORE FOR PART OF THE SAME PARCEL OF EVERGREEN OAK ACORNS WHICH FAILED I HAD GIVEN TO SIR THOMAS SEWELL THE YEAR BEFORE TO SOW AND HE ASSURES ME THAT NOT ONE OF THEM CAME UP WITH HIM I LIKEWISE DISCOVERED THOUGH TOO LATE THAT THE SPANISH CHESNUTS WHICH FAILED HAD BEEN KILN DRIED THIS IS A COMMON PRACTICE IN SPAIN TO PREVENT THEIR SPROUTING BY THE DAMP HEAT IN THE HOLD OF THE SHIP I SHOULD NOT MY LORD BE SO PARTICULAR IN EXPLAINING THE CAUSE OF MY DISAPPOINTMENT BUT TO SHEW THE CARE THAT IS NECESSARY TO BE TAKEN BY PERSONS ABROAD IN THE CHOICE OF THE SEEDS AS WELL AS THE STATE THEY OUGHT TO BE IN IF THEY EXPECT THEY SHOULD ANSWER THE GREAT END WE PROPOSE BEFORE I MENTION THE METHOD IN WHICH I TREATED THESE ACORNS I MUST OBSERVE TO YOUR LORDSHIP THAT THOUGH I HAVE FORMERLY BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL AS TO PRE SERVE BOTH ACORNS AND CHESNUTS FOR THE SPACE OF AYEAR IN BEES WAX SEVERAL OF WHICH HAVE AFTERWARDS VEGE TATED AND SOME OF THEM ARE NOW GROWN INTO TREES YET I ALWAYS FOUND THAT MANY OF THEM WERE ROTTEN WHEN THEY WERE TAKEN OUT OF THE WAX WHICH MADE ME SUSPECT THAT IT WAS OWING TO THE TOO GREAT HEAT OF THE MELTED WAX THAT SO MANY OF THEM WERE DESTROY ED THIS PUT ME ON THINKING OF THE FOLLOWING ME THOD TO GUARD THE SEEDS TO BE PRESERVED FROM TOO GREAT HEAT WHICH I HAVE NOW THE PLEASURE TO SHEW YOUR LORDSHIP AND THE REST OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY THE GOOD EFFECTS OF AFTER77 AFTER I HAD CHOSEN OUT THE FAIREST ACORNS LAYING ASIDE SUCH AS HAD SPECKS PROCEEDING FROM THE WOUNDS OF INSECTS I WIPED THEM VERY CLEAN TILL THEY WERE QUITE BRIGHT FOR FEAR OF ANY CONDENSED PERSPIRATION ON THE SURFACE WHICH IF INCLOSED WOULD TURN TO MOUL DINESS I THEN POURED SOME MELTED BEESWAX INTO A CHINA PLATE ABOUT HALF AN INCH DEEP AND SOON AS THE WAX WAS COOL BUT STILL VERY PLIABLE I CUT OUT WITH A PENKNIFE AS MUCH AS WOULD INCLOSE ONE ACORN THIS I WRAPPED ROUND IT ROLLING IT BETWEEN MY HANDS TILL THE EDGES OF THE WAX WERE PERFECTLY UNITED IN THE SAME MANNER I COVERED ABOUT 36 OF THEM WITH ALL THE CAU TION IN MY POWER SO THAT AFTER THEY HAD BEEN SET TO HARDEN I COULD NOT PERCEIVE THE LEAST CRACK IN THEM WHEN THEY WERE QUITE COLD AND HARD I PREPARED AN OVAL CHIP BOX OF 7 INCHES LONG 4 12 BROAD AND 3 12 DEEP INTO THIS I POURED MELTED BEESWAX TO THE DEPTH OF AN INCH AND HALF AND WHEN I COULD BEAR MY FINGER IN IT I LAID THE COVERED ACORNS AT THE BOTTOM IN ROWS AS CLOSE AS I COULD TOGETHER AFTERWARDS OTHER ROWS OVER THEM TILL THE BOX WAS FULL AND WHEN THE FIRST WAX BEGAN TO COOL I POURED SOME WAX THAT WAS BARE LY FLUID OVER THE UPPERMOST ACORNS TILL THEY WERE QUITE COVERED IN ORDER TO COOL THEM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE I SET THE BOX NEAR A WINDOW WHERE THE SASH WAS RAISED A LITTLE TO LET IN A STREAM OF COLD AIR WHEN THEY WERE ALMOST COLD I PERCEIVED THE WAX HAD SHRUNK A LITTLE HERE AND THERE AND LEFT SOME CHINKS THESE I IMMEDIATELY FILLED UP WICH VERY SOFT WAX PRESSING IT VERY CLOSE AND SMOOTH AFTER IT WAS QUITE COLD AND HARD I PUT ON THE COVER OF THE BOX AND PLACED IT ON A SHELF IN A CLOSET TILL THE BEGINNING OF AUGUST LAST WHEN I SENT IT TO THE CARE OF MR DACOSTA CLERK TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY TO THEIR HOUSE IN CRANE78 CRANE COURT TO BE PRODUCED AND EXAMINED BEFORE THE ROYAL SOCIETY AT SOME OF THEIR FIRST MEETINGS AFTER THE LONG VACATION MY HEALTH WOULD NOT PERMIT ME TO AT TEND MYSELF BUT I AM INFORMED MY LORD THAT WHEN THEY WERE CUT OPEN AND EXAMINED BEFORE YOUR LORD SHIP AND THE REST OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY PRESENT THEIR APPEARANCE PROMISED SUCCESS AND THAT THEY WERE OR DERED TO BE DELIVERED BY DR MORTON SECRETARY TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY TO THE CARE OF MR WILLIAM AITON BOTANIC GARDINER TO HER ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCESS DOWAGER OF WALES AT KEW AT MY REQUEST THAT THE ROYAL SOCIETY MIGHT BE INFORMED WHETHER THEY WOULD VEGETATE I HAVE JUST NOW MY LORD HAD THE PLEASURE OF RE CEIVING A LETTER FROM MR AITON ADVISING ME THAT HE HAD SENT TO MR ROBERTSON HOUSEKEEPER TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY TWO POTS WITH THE YOUNG OAKS RISING FROM THE ACORNS PRESERVED IN WAX WHICH DR MORTON SENT HIM FROM THE ROYAL SOCIETY IN DECEMBER LAST AND AM WELL PERSUADED HE HAS CAREFULLY ATTENDED TO AN EXPE RIMENT THE SUCCESS OF WHICH IF PROPERLY FOLLOWED MAY IN A FEW YEARS PUT US IN POSSESSION OF THE MOST RARE AND VALUABLE SEEDS IN A VEGETATING STATE FROM THE REMO TEST PARTS OF THE WORLD WHICH IN TIME MAY ANSWER THE GREAT END OF THE IMPROVEMENT AND ADVANCEMENT OF OUR TRADE WITH OUR AMERICAN COLONIES I AM MY LORD WITH THE GREATEST RESPECT YOUR LORDSHIPS MOST HUMBLE AND OBEDIENT SERVANT GRAYSINN MARCH 9 1768 JOHN ELLIS SIR79 KEW MARCH 8 1768 S I R I RECEIVED DECEMBER 5 1767 OF DOCTOR MORTON OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM A PARCEL OF ACORNS PRESERVED IN WAX THE QUANTITY OF ACORNS WHICH I RECEIVED WAS 34 AND ACCORDING TO YOUR DESIRE AND DIRECTION THEY WERE SOWED AS SOON AS I RECEIVED THEM INTO A SANDY LIGHT LOOM I PLACED THE POTS WITH THE ACORNS UNDER A FRAME WHERE THEY REMAINED TILL JANUARY THE 28 I THEN TOOK THE POTS WITH THE ACORNS OUT OF THE FRAME AND PLACED THEM NEAR A WINDOW IN ONE OF OUR LARGE AIRY STOVES WHERE THEY HAVE REMAINED EVER SINCE AC CORDING TO YOUR DESIRE THEY SHALL BE SENT TOMORROW TO THE ROYAL SOCIETYS HOUSE I THINK THE GENTLEMEN OF THAT HONOURABLE SOCIETY WILL BE PLEASED TO SEE THE METHOD OF PRESERVING SEEDS IN WAX PROVE SO SUCCESS FUL AS THE ACORN IS ONE OF THE WORST OF SEEDS TO KEEP ANY TIME OUT OF THE GROUND FROM PERISHING AND THE GOOD SUCCESS THERE IS FROM THOSE FEW WHICH I RECEIVED FROM DOCTOR MORTON I AM THEREFORE OF THE OPINION THAT IF SEEDS ARE FOUND AND DRY AND CARE FULLY PUT UP IN THE WAX IT IS THE BEST METHOD THAT HAS EVER BEEN FOUND OUT TO PRESERVE SEEDS FROM DISTANT COUNTRIES I AM SIR YOUR MOST OBEDIENT AND HUMBLE SERVANT TO JOHN ELLIS ESQ WILLIAM AITON GRAYSINN N B THERE ARE SIXTEEN IN ONE POT AND NINE IN THE OTHER THAT ARE ALREADY COME UP AND MOST OF THEM FROM FOUR TO SIX INCHES HIGH 5 XII A

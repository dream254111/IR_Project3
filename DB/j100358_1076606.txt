j100358,The School Review,1076606,Effect of the NonRequirement of Latin for Graduation upon the Latin Classes of the High School,i244661,DISCUSSION EFFECT OF THE NONREQUIREMENT OF LATIN FOR GRADUA TION UPON THE LATIN CLASSES OF THE HIGH SCHOOL This paper simply brings before you the statistics relating to the study of Latin in the Alliance high school and some inductions there from I undertook this study to satisfy myself regarding the status of Latin in the high school and the effect of the nonrequirement of Latin for graduation upon the highschool enrolment as well as upon the quantity and quality of the Latin enrolment I have confined the statistics to the ninth and tenth grades for the following reasons i because Latin has been elective at the beginning of the third year in high school since 19067 so has had no direct bear ing upon the enrolment above the tenth grade since that date 2 be cause the measure of those who pass from the ninth into the tenth grade gives a figure from which it is possible to approximate the number that will remain in the high school statistics show that the percentage that drop out during the first year or at its close is approximately the percentage that drop out during the remaining three years of the course 3 because time enough has not yet elapsed since Latin was made entirely elective to measure the product of the third and fourth years This subject was made elective only in September I9I0 In I9045 48 entered gth grade 26 of these entered Ioth grade In 19056 42    22   In I9067 57    26   In 19078 33 2   20    In 19089 43   31     In 190910 63    30      From these figures it appears that 286 students entered the high school and of these 286 I3I dropped out of school for various reasons before the tenth grade was reached leaving 155 pupils or 54 per cent of those entering the ninth grade who survived it During this period everyone entering the ninth grade was required to take Latin In 1910II Latin was made elective and Latin manual training or domestic science could be taken during the first two years in high school Four points in language are now required for graduation and all students intending to enter college for classical training are urged to carry at least three years of Latin But the four points required for graduation may be either German or Latin The following are for the years since the change was made 45THE SCHOOL REVIEW In 191III 50 entered 9th grade 35 of these entered Ioth grade In 191112 59  I I 41 c I In 191213 53 c c t 39   cC c From these figures it appears that I62 pupils entered the high school and of these I62 47 dropped out for various reasons before the tenth grade was reached leaving 115 pupils or 71 per cent of those entering the ninth grade who survived it Comparison of this percentage 7I with that when Latin was compulsory 54 shows a gain of I7 per cent of the enrolment remaining in high school when Latin is elective Again under the compulsory Latin regime from I904 to I9I0 286 students carried the Latin and of these as given before 54 per cent made satisfactory passing marks and entered the Caesar class From 91o0II to 191213 inclusive the time during which Latin has been elective the following are the figures relative to the Latin classes In 910II 30 entered 9thgrade Latin 23 of these entered Caesar In 191112 30  22 In I912I3 26  c   24 lC C cc c This gives a total of 86 entering the ninthgrade Latin class and 69 or 80 per cent surviving to enter the tenthgrade Latin class Com parison of this with the 54 per cent when Latin was compulsory shows a gain of 26 per cent That is of those who entered the ninthgrade Latin 26 per cent more survive the first year than when all were required to take the subject Again using the figures heretofore given we find that the percentage entering the Caesar class from I904 to I9I0 was 54 per cent of those entering the high school From 910o to 1913 the number entering the high school was I62 and the number entering the Caesar class was 69 or 42 per cent of the enrolmenta loss of 12 per cent on the enrol ment to the secondyear Latin class Thus with a loss of I2 per cent to the secondyear Latin class we not only retained this 2 per cent but an additional I7 per cent to the second year of the high school The Latin manual training and domestic science teachers report that the work is exceedingly pleasant because the classes contain only the pupils that want the work The Latin classes are smaller but are composed of students who want the Latin and the handminded pupils are granted the privilege of taking what appeals to them and that in which they can make good Our Latin teacher gives the following as the good results of making Latin elective i The discipline is much 46DISCUSSION easier as the uninterested and therefore restless pupils are not in the class 2 There is a greater sympathy and oneness of purpose be tween the teacher and pupils bringing about a higher quality of work 3 Better results are secured from a less amount of energy expended 4 More ground can be covered in the given length of time The conclusions to be drawn from this study are as follows I That making Latin elective has decreased about 50 per cent the number of students entering the ninthgrade Latin class but that the secondyear classes are only 12 per cent smaller than before 2 That this decrease is accompanied by and compensated for by an increased number remaining for secondyear high school which means a corresponding increase remaining throughout the highschool course 7I per cent now remaining as compared with 54 per cent before 3 Better satisfied students better satisfied instructors and much better quality of work as a whole W R PATE ALLIANCE NEBRASKA Superintendent of Schools NoTEIn answer to the question Do you feel that you had oppor tunity to eliminate other causes for increased attendance in the high school Mr Pate replies I know of no other cause for increased attendance other than a general increase in highschool attendance all over this state during the last few years There has been little change in the faculty to be sure some new teachers have come in from time to time but only in such manner and number in the last three years as heretofore and there has been no change in the course of study other than that noted in the paper The school activi ties also are practically the same as in former yearsactivities in athletics literary productions etc Every child under sixteen years of age is compelled by law to attend school and this law is enforced but not more rigidly during the last three years than for three or more years previous to the last three years You will note by the statistics that the average number entering the high school is very little larger during the last three years than before that time but the surprising feature is the greater percentage of the entering number who remain for tenthgrade work You will note throughout that all per centages are based on the entering number hence any increase in the entering number would decrease the percentage remaining unless a correspondingly larger number should remain for tenthgrade work The average number entering the high school during the last three years is 54 as against 48 for the six preceding years This slight increase is probably due to the increased number of people in the school districtTHrE EDITORS 47

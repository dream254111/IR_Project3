ORGANOMETALLIEBODIESFOURTH MEMOIR BY E FRANKLAND PHDA FR S LECTURER ON CHEMISTRY AT ST BARTHOLOMEWS HOSPITAL RECEIVED FEBRUARY 17READ MARCH 3 1859 IN A FORMER MEMOIR I DESCRIBED THE PRODUCTION OF A SERIES OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS CONTAINING THE METAL TIN IN COMBINATION WITH THE RADICALS METHYL ETHYL AND AMYL THESE BODIES WERE FORMED BY THE ACTION OF LIGHT OR HEAT UPON THE IODIDES OF METHYL ETHYL AND AMYL RESPECTIVELY PLACED IN CONTACT WITH STRIPS OF TINFOIL MY ATTENTION WAS AT THAT TIME ESPECIALLY DIRECTED TO THE COMPOUND FORMED BY THE UNION OF TIN WITH ETHYL AND TO WHICH THE NAME OF STANETHYL WAS GIVEN THE IODIDE OF STANETHYL SN C4 H15 WAS PREPARED BY EXPOSING IODIDE OF ETHYL TO LIGHT OR HEAT IN THE PRESENCE OF TINFOIL AND BY ACTING WITH ZINC UPON AN AQUEOUS SOLUTION OF THIS IODIDE OF STANETHYL OR OF THE CHLORIDE OF THE SAME BODY STANETHYL ITSELF C4HSN WAS OBTAINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH A THEORY OF THE CONSTITUTION OF ALL ORGANOMETALLIC BODIES WHICH I THEN PROPOSED THE ABOVE TIN

EVIDENT THAT THE APPLICATION OF THIS VIEW TO THE ABOVE BODIES WOULD RECEIVE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT IF THE SECOND EQUIVALENT OF IODINE IN THE STANNIC IODIDE COULD BE REPLACED BY ETHYL OR SOME OTHER ANALOGOUS ORGANIC GROUP IN THE MEMOIR ALREADY ALLUDED TO I MENTIONED THAT IN STUDYING THE BEHAVIOUR OF STANETHYL UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HEAT EVIDENCE WAS OBTAINED OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS VERY COMPOUNDSTANNIC ETHIDE OR BINETHIDE OF TIN AS I THEN NAMED IT THIS BODY OBVIOUSLY BEARS THE SAME RELATION TO STANNIC IODIDE AS STANETHYL BEARS TO STANNOUS IODIDE SNI SNC H5 LI LC4 H5 STANNIC IODIDE STANNIC ETHIDE ALTHOUGH THERE COULD BE LITTLE DOUBT OF THE FORMATION OF STANNIC ETHIDE BY HEATING STANETHYL TO 1500 C YET I COULD NOT SUCCEED IN OBTAINING THE FORMER BODY IN A STATE OF PURITY FROM THIS SOURCE IT OCCURRED TO ME HOWEVER THAT STANNIC ETHIODIDE WOULD402 DR E FRANKLANDS RESEARCHES ON ORGANOMETALLIC BODIES PROBABLY BE EASILY CONVERTED INTO STANNIC ETHIDE BY BRINGING IT INTO CONTACT WITH ZINC ETHYL AND A PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENT COMPLETELY REALIZED THIS EXPECTATION THE RESULTS OF THIS REACTION TOGETHER WITH ITS EXTENSION TO OTHER ANALOGOUS ORGANOMETALLIC BODIES ARE DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING PAGES I ACTION OF ZINCETHYL UPON LODIDE OF STANETHQYL ABOUT TWO OUNCES OF CRYSTALS OF IODIDE OF STANETHYL WERE GRADUALLY ADDED TO A STRONG SOLUTION OF ZINCETHYL IN ETHER THE CRYSTALS RAPIDLY DISSOLVED WITH A MODERATE EVOLUTION OF HEAT AND THE LIQUID FINALLY ASSUMED A SYRUPY CONSISTENCE CARE WAS TAKEN TO PRE SERVE AN EXCESS OF ZINCETHYL BY STOPPING THE ADDITION OF THE IODIDE BEFORE THE LIQUID CEASED TO EFFERVESCE WITH WATER THE SYRUPY LIQUID WAS NOW SUBMITTED TO DISTILLATION IT BEGAN TO BOIL AT 70 C BUT THE THERMOMETER RAPIDLY ROSE TO 1800 BETWEEN WHICH TEMPERATURE AND 2000 C THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCT PASSED OVER SOLID IODIDE OF ZINC CONTAINING A LITTLE ZINCETHYL BEING LEFT IN THE RETORT THE DISTILLATE ON BEING WASHED WITH WATER EFFERVESCED STRONGLY DEPOSITING OXIDE OF ZINC WHICH WAS DISSOLVED ON THE ADDITION OF A LITTLE ACETIC ACID THE DENSE ETHEREAL LIQUID WAS NOW SEPARATED FROM THE SUPERNATANT AQUEOUS STRATUM AND PLACED OVER CHLORIDE OF CALCIUM FOR FORTYEIGHT

FROM THE DIGESTER AT A TEMPERATURE NOT EXCEEDING 150 IN ORDER TO PREVENT AS FAR AS POSSIBLE THE FORMATION OF ANY ZINCETHYL WHICH WOULD BE MORE DIFFICULT THAN ZINCMETHYL TO SEPARATE FROM THE INTERMEDIATE BODY IF THE LATTER WERE PRODUCED IODIDE OF METHYL IN SLIGHT EXCESS OVER THE EQUIVALENT QUAN  TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY FOR 1855 P 266412 DR E FRANKLANDS RESEARCHES OR

TEMPERATURE THE REMAINDER OF THE PRODUCT WHICH WAS CONSIDERABLE AND CONSISTED OF PURE ZINCETHYL DISTILLED OVER NO EVIDENCE WHATEVER WAS OBTAINED OF THE EXISTENCE OF AN INTERMEDIATE COMPOUND CONTAINING BOTH ETHYL AND METHYL VI ZINERNETHYL THE EXPERIMENTS DETAILED IN THE FOREGOING PAGES REQUIRING THE USE OF CONSIDERABLE QUANTITIES OF ZINCMETHYL MY ATTENTION WAS DIRECTED TO THE PREPARATION OF THIS BODY IN MUCH LARGERQUANTITIES THAN COULD BE OBTAINED BY THE OPERATIONS IN SEALED GLASS TUBES DESCRIBED IN MY PREVIOUS PAPERS ON THIS COMPOUND I FOUND THAT THE PREPARATION OF A STRONG ETHEREAL SOLUTION OF ZINCMETHYL SUCCEEDED MOST SATISFACTORILY IN THE COPPER DIGESTER USED FOR THE PRODUCTION OF LARGE QUANTITIES OF THE CORRESPONDING ETHYL COM POUND IN FACT THE DECOMPOSITION BY ZINC OF AN ETHEREAL SOLUTION OF IODIDE OF METHYL IS MUCH MORE QUICKLY AND PERFECTLY EFFECTED THAN THAT OF A SIMILAR SOLUTION OF IODIDE OF ETHYL HEATED TO 1000 IN THE COPPER DIGESTER THREE OUNCES BY MEASURE OF IODIDE OF METHYL MIXED WITH TWO OUNCES OF ANHYDROUS ETHER WERE PERFECTLY DECOMPOSED IN SIX HOURS ON OPENING THE DIGESTER A VERY SMALL QUANTITY ONLY OF GAS ESCAPEDTHE WHOLE OF THE IODIDE HAVING BEEN TRANSFORMED

WITH LARGE QUANTITIES OF MATERIALS I HAVE ENTIRELY FAILED IN OBTAINING PURE ZINCMETHYL BY ACTING WITH ZINC UPON A MIXTURE OF ETHER AND IODIDE OF METHYL REPEATED ATTEMPTS TO PRODUCE PURE ZINCMETHYL FROM ZINC AND IODIDE OF METHYL ALONE IN THE COPPER DIGESTER WERE ALSO UNSUCCESSFUL ALTHOUGH THIS METHOD GENERALLY SUCCEEDS IN SMALL GLASS TUBES IODIDE OF METHYL IS NOT ATTACKED BY ZINC AT 1000 C EVEN AFTER LONG DIGESTION AN ADMIXTURE OF 3 OR 4 PER CENT OF ETHER IS HOWEVER QUITE SUFFICIENT TO DETER MINE THE ACTION AT THIS TEMPERATURE BUT WITH SO SMALL A PROPORTION OF ETHER THE WHOLE OF THE IODIDE IS NEVER DECOMPOSED AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EFFECTUALLY SEPARATE EITHER THIS OR THE ETHER FROM THE ZINCMETHYL PRODUCED WHEN THE DIGESTER CONTAINING ZINC AND PURE IODIDE OF METHYL IS HEATED TO ANY TEMPERATURE FROM 120 TO 2000 C THE IODIDE IS DECOMPOSED BUT AT THE LOWER TEMPERATURES THE DECOMPOSITION IS NEVER COMPLETE WHILST AT THE HIGHER ONES LITTLE OR NO ZINCMETHYL IS PRODUCED THE METHYL BEING RESOLVED INTO GASES THIS ANOMALY IN THE RESULTS OBTAINED FROM THE SAME MATERIALS HEATED IN A COPPER DIGESTER AND IN GLASS TUBES IS DOUBTLESS DUE TO THE DIFFERENCE IN THE CONDITIONS OBTAINING IN THE TWO CASES IN A GLASS TUBE HALFIMMERSED IN A HEATED OILBATH A DISTILLATION OF THE INTERNAL LIQUID IS CONSTANTLY GOING ON THE VAPOUR FORMED IN THE LOWER PORTION OF THE TUBE BEING CONDENSED IN THE UPPER PART EXPOSED TO THE COOLING INFLUENCE OF THE AIR MDCCCLIX 3 I414 DR E FRANKLANDS RESEARCHES ON ORGANOMETALLIC BODIES AND FLOWING OVER AN EXTENSIVE SURFACE OF ZINC IN ITS DESCENT BUT IN A DIGESTER OF THICK COPPER THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE VESSEL ARE OWING TO THE HIGH CONDUCTIVITY OF THE METAL MAINTAINED AT SO UNIFORM A TEMPERATURE AS TO PREVENT ANY SUCH DISTILLATION AND CIRCU LATION OF THE LIQUID FROM TAKING PLACE REGARDING THE BODY DESCRIBED ABOVE AS A MERE MIXTURE OF ZINCMETHYL AND ETHER INCAPABLE OF BEING SEPARATED ON ACCOUNT OF THE CLOSE PROXIMITY OF THEIR BOILINGPOINTS I ANTICIPATED A MORE SUCCESSFUL RESULT BY MIXING THE IODIDE OF METHYL WITH METHYLIC ETHER INSTEAD OF VINIC ETHER AS METHYLIC ETHER BOILS ACCORDING TO BERTHELOT AT 210 C IT WAS THOUGHT THAT NO SUCH DIFFICULTY OF SEPARATION COULD ARISE THE BODIES EMPLOYED WOULD THEN IN FACT BE EXACTLY HOMOLOGOUS WITH THOSE SO SUCCESSFULLY USED IN THE PREPARATION OF PURE ZINCETHYL ON THE LARGE SCALE IT WAS FOUND THAT IODIDE OF METHYL MIXED WITH OXIDE OF METHYL WAS READILY ATTACKED BY ZINC EVEN AT THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WATERBATH THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENT WAS THEREFORE MADE ABOUT THREE OUNCES BY MEASURE OF IODIDE OF METHYL WERE PLACED IN THE COPPER DIGESTER WITH THE USUAL QUANTITY OF ZINC OXIDE OF METHYL WELL DRIED BY PASSING OVER CHLORIDE OF CALCIUM WAS FORCED INTO THE DIGESTER BY A COMPRESSION PUMP UNTIL IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THE VOLUME OF LIQUIFIED ETHER WOULD BE ABOUT EQUAL TO THAT OF THE IODIDE EMPLOYED THE DIGESTER WAS THEN HEATED IN A WATERBATH FOR THREE DAYS THE PRODUCT OBTAINED ON DISTILLATION WAS VERY RICH IN ZINCMETHYL IT CONTAINED HOWEVER TRACES OF UNDECOMPOSED IODIDE OF METHYL BUT THIS WAS EASILY GOT RID OF BY THE ADDITION OF A FEW GRAINS OF SODIUM WHICH FORMING SODIUMMETHYL REACTED UPON THE IODIDE OF METHYL IN THE MANNER I HAVE ALREADY POINTED OUTT ON RECTIFICATION THE GREATER PORTION OF THE LIQUID THUS OBTAINED DISTILLED AT 430 A SMALL RESIDUUM ONLY COMING OVER BETWEEN 430 AND 48 BOTH THESE PORTIONS YIELDED ON ANALYSIS THE SAME RESULTS VIZ 29592954 PER CENT OF CARBON AND 7411710 PER CENT OF HYDROGEN THESE NUMBERS DO NOT AGREE WITH THOSE REQUIRED FOR ZINCMETHYL VIZ 25C25 CARBON AND 631 HYDROGEN THEY APPROACH HOWEVER TO THOSE WHICH WOULD BE YIELDED BY TWO EQUIVALENTS OF ZINCMETHYL AND ONE EQUIVALENT OF OXIDE OF METHYL 2 C2 H3ZN2 C H3 02 WHICH REQUIRE 30A49 PER CENT OF CARBON AND 762 PER CENT OF HYDROGEN THIS RESULT IS THEREFORE EXACTLY HOMOLOGOUS WITH THAT OBTAINED BY THE ADMIXTURE OF VINIC ETHER WITH THE IODIDE OF METHYL IN CONCLUSION AFTER AN EXPENDITURE OF MANY POUNDS OF IODIDE OF METHYL I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO OBTAIN EVEN THE SMALLEST QUANTITY OF PURE ZINCMETHYL BY THE USE OF A COPPER DIGESTER ON THE OTHER HAND IN ETHEREAL SOLUTION A MUCH LARGER PRODUCT IS OBTAINED THAN IN THE CORRESPONDING PREPARATION OF ZINCETHYL OWING NO DOUBT TO THE LOWER TEMPE RATURE AT WHICH THE CRYSTALLINE COMPOUND OF ZINCMETHYL AND IODIDE OF ZINC IS BROKEN UP  PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS

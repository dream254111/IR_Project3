OrganometallieBodiesFourth Memoir BY E FRANKLAND PhDA FR S Lecturer on Chemistry at St Bartholomews Hospital Received February 17Read March 3 1859 IN a former memoir I described the production of a series of organic compounds containing the metal tin in combination with the radicals methyl ethyl and amyl These bodies were formed by the action of light or heat upon the iodides of methyl ethyl and amyl respectively placed in contact with strips of tinfoil My attention was at that time especially directed to the compound formed by the union of tin with ethyl and to which the name of stanethyl was given The iodide of stanethyl Sn C4 H15 was prepared by exposing iodide of ethyl to light or heat in the presence of tinfoil and by acting with zinc upon an aqueous solution of this iodide of stanethyl or of the chloride of the same body stanethyl itself C4HSn was obtained In accordance with a theory of the constitution of all organometallic bodies which I then proposed the above tin compounds were respectively represented as the analogues of the protiodide and biniodide of tin thus SnI SnC4 H Stannous iodide Stannous etbide SnI 5nC4 H5 II Stannic iodide Stannic ethiodide It is evident that the application of this view to the above bodies would receive additional support if the second equivalent of iodine in the stannic iodide could be replaced by ethyl or some other analogous organic group In the memoir already alluded to I mentioned that in studying the behaviour of stanethyl under the influence of heat evidence was obtained of the existence of this very compoundstannic ethide or binethide of tin as I then named it This body obviously bears the same relation to stannic iodide as stanethyl bears to stannous iodide SnI SnC H5 LI lC4 H5 Stannic iodide Stannic ethide Although there could be little doubt of the formation of stannic ethide by heating stanethyl to 1500 C yet I could not succeed in obtaining the former body in a state of purity from this source It occurred to me however that stannic ethiodide would402 DR E FRANKLANDS RESEARCHES ON ORGANOMETALLIC BODIES probably be easily converted into stannic ethide by bringing it into contact with zinc ethyl and a preliminary experiment completely realized this expectation The results of this reaction together with its extension to other analogous organometallic bodies are described in the following pages I Action of Zincethyl upon lodide of Stanethqyl About two ounces of crystals of iodide of stanethyl were gradually added to a strong solution of zincethyl in ether The crystals rapidly dissolved with a moderate evolution of heat and the liquid finally assumed a syrupy consistence Care was taken to pre serve an excess of zincethyl by stopping the addition of the iodide before the liquid ceased to effervesce with water The syrupy liquid was now submitted to distillation It began to boil at 70 C but the thermometer rapidly rose to 1800 between which temperature and 2000 C the greater part of the product passed over solid iodide of zinc containing a little zincethyl being left in the retort The distillate on being washed with water effervesced strongly depositing oxide of zinc which was dissolved on the addition of a little acetic acid The dense ethereal liquid was now separated from the supernatant aqueous stratum and placed over chloride of calcium for fortyeight hours On being distilled the thermometer soon became stationary at 1810 C and the distil late passing at this temperature was collected apart Submitted to analysis it yielded the following results 1 2185 grn burnt with oxide of copper and free oxygen yielded 3295 grmn carbonic acid and 1703 grm water II 2338 grm gave 3518 grm carbonic acid and 1845 grm water III 0992 grm placed in a stream of oxygen and the vapour thus mixed with excess of oxygen passed through an ignited tube gave 0618 grm binoxide of tin These results correspond closely with the formula of stannic ethide Sn fC4 H5 C4H as

ethide vapour  806147 Found   8021 Stannic ethide boils at 1810 C and distils unchanged thus differing from stannous ethyl which decomposes at 150 C chiefly into metallic tin and stannic ethidea reaction calling to mind the behaviour of stannous oxide when boiled with a caustic alkali Stannic ethide is highly inflammable burning with a lurid flame fringed with deep blue and evolving white fumes of stannic oxide  In oxygen it burns much more brilliantly with a red light fringed with blue It was important to ascertain the deportment of stannic ethide with negative elements since if it were found to be capable of direct combination its analogy to inorganic stan nic compounds would be to a great extent disproved Like zincethyl however stannic ethide is incapable of combining with any other element without the expulsion of at least an equivalent amount of the ethyl it contains Treated with iodine the latter dissolves with a deep red colour which gradually dis appears and if the addition of iodine be continued until decoloration be no longer effected the resulting liquid on being submitted to distillation is found to consist of iodide of ethyl which distils over and an iodine salt possessing the insupport ably pungent odour of one of the products of the action of tin upon iodide of ethyl at 1600 C and described by MM CAHOURS and RICHE as iodide of distannous ethyl Sn2C4 H521 The iodine salt appears in fact to be either identical with this body or to consist of stannic todotriethide Sn2C4 H1531  Whilst engaged with these experiments Mr BuaexToN announced the formation of stannic ethide Proceedings of the Royal Society vol ix p 315 and at the same time mentioned his intention to study the salts formed by the action of iodine bromine c upon that body I have therefore not prosecuted the inquiry further in this direction404 DIR E FRANKLANDS RESEARCHES ON OROGANOMETALLIC BODIES Stannic ethide does not decompose water and is not acted upon by strong aqueous hydrochloric acid in the cold When however the two liquids are mixed over mer cury and exposed to a heat of 800 or 900 C bubbles of gas are slowly evolved but it requires from twelve to eighteen hours to complete the reaction Treated in this way 2268 grm stannic ethide yielded 75 cub cent of gas at 8 C and 2098 mm mercurial pressure equivalent to 2011 cub cent at 00 C and 760 mm pressure The gas

hydride of ethyl equivalent to 0262 grm of ethyl or 1155 per cent The analysis of the salt formed is still required to corroborate this result II Action of Zincmethyl upon Iodide of Stanethyl The successful substitution of the second equivalent of iodine in stannic iodide by ethyl led me to hope that it might in like manner be replaced by methyl amyl or any other homologous radical thus forming a stannic compound containing two radicals of different composition To establish this point I submitted iodide of stanethyl to the action of zinemethyl About three ounces of the crystallized iodide were gradually added to a solution of zinemethyl in ether care being taken to preserve an excess of zincmethyl considerable heat was evolved and the vessel in which the reaction was performed required to be plunged into cold water On distilling the product it began to boil at 400 C and the whole of the volatile portion passed over below 1400 leaving iodide of zinc in the retort The distillate on being treated with dilute acetic acid effervesced strongly owing to the presence of zincmethyl at the same time a dense layer of an ethereal liquid separated This latter after being washed with six or eight times its bulk of water was dried over chloride of calcium On rectification some ether came over at 65 but the thermometer soon rose to 1430 between which temperature and 148 C a large portion distilled The last drops came over at 1500 C The section which distilled between 143 and 148 was taken for the following experiments I 2985 grin burnt with oxide of copper and free oxygen gave 3823 grm carbonic acid and 2097 grm water II 2888 grm gave 3733 grm carbonic acid and 2120 grm water III 0678 grm decomposed in a sealed tube with nitric acid gave 0495 grm bin oxide of

stanethyl may therefore be thus expressed Sn fcH5 n C2 H3 Zn C2 H3 Zn I The new body thus formed and for which I propose the name stannic ethylonethide is a colourless limpid liquid undistinguishable in appearance from stannic ethide It MIDCCCLIx3406 DR B FRANKLANDS RESEARCHES ON ORGANOMETALLIC BODIES possesses like the latter a very faint ethereal odour and a slightly metallic taste Its specific gravity is 12319 at 190 C It does not solidify at 13 C Stannic ethylo methide boils between 144 C and 1460 C A determination of its vapourdensity gave the following resuls Weight of stannic ethylomethide    1967 grm Observed volume of vapour 442 cub cent Temperature of oilbath 1990 C Height of barometer 7544 mm Height of inner column of mercury 1130 mm Height of column of oil   2750 mm From these data the specific gravity of the vapour was calculated to be 6838 Stannic ethylomethide vapour therefore consists of one volume of tin vapour two volumes of ethyl and two volumes of methyl the five volumes condensed to two 1 vol Tin vapour 405367 2 vols Ethyl 200390 2 vols Methyl 103652 2 vols Stannic ethylomethide vapour     7 09409 Found  6838 Stannic ethylomethide is easily inflammable exhibiting the same phenomena on com bustion in air and oxygen as stannic ethide It manifests also the same deportment as the latter with chlorine iodine and bromine Its combination with these elements is always attended with the expulsion of methyl Stannic ethylomethide dissolves iodine assuming a magnificent crimson colour which disappears with extreme slowness unless heat be applied to the liquid when however action has in this way once been set up it goes on with considerable rapidity even in the cold About two ounces of stannic ethylomethide were treated with iodine until the liquid no longer became decolorized The excess of iodine was then removed by agitation with mercury and the product sub mitted to distillation It began to boil at a low temperature and the distillate had the odour specific gravity and all the properties of iodide of methyl The boilingpoint of the residual liquid now rapidly rose to 2070 C whilst very little of it passed over The distillation was then interrupted and the strawcoloured liquid remaining in the retort was submitted to analysis It yielded the following results I 4916 grm burnt with oxide of copper 3 inches of metallic copper being placed in front of the combustion tube gave 2888 grm carbonic acid and 1493 grm water II 5620 grm gave 3278 grm carbonic acid and 1761 grm water III 5487 grm gave 3203 grm carbonic acid and 1696 grm water IV 6502 grm decomposed with alcoholic potash the solution then acidified with nitric acid and precipitated with nitrate of silver gave 5146 grm iodide of silverDR E FRANKLANDS RESEARCHES ON ORGANOMETALLIC BODIES 407 V 5217 grm heated with strong nitric acid the solution evaporated to dryness and ignited gave 2591 grm binoxide of tin These numbers closely correspond with those calculated from the formula of iodide of distanethyl Sn2 C4 H1 lI as is obvious from the following comparison Calculated Found I II III IV V Mean CS   48 1587 1602 1588 1592 15

the action of iodine upon stannic ethylomethide converts two equivalents of the latter into one equivalent of iodide of distanethyl with the separation of two equivalents of iodide of methyl 2SnQ I421JHo 3J 2 3I  Sn2 QC It might have been expected that a stannic compound of the form rC4H5 Sn C21H3 2 I C2113 would have been produced differing empirically from iodide of distanethyl only by containing one additional equivalent of hydrogen but the formula of the former body requires 1581 per cent of carbon and 362 per cent of hydrogen and although these numbers are not altogether incompatible with the results of the above analyses yet the fact of the production of iodide of methyl in the reaction is utterly irreconcileable with the formation of such a compound Iodide of distanethyl has already been examined both by M LowIG and by MM CAHOURS and RICHE but as the descriptions of these chemists are so little in harmony with each other it is impossible to make use of them for the identification of the body obtained in the above reaction It appears however to agree in properties with the iodide of distanethyl prepared by MM CAHOuRs and RI1E Iodide of distanethyl produced by the action of iodine upon stannic ethylomethide 3uH2408 DR E FRANKLAND S RESEARCHES ON ORGANOMETALLIC BODIES is a light strawcoloured somewhat oily liquid which does not solidify on exposure to a cold of  130 C and possesses an extremely pungent and intolerable odour resembling oil of mustard the inhalation even of a very minute amount of its vapour being highly irritating to the respiratory organs Its specific gravity at 150 C is 20329 At 2080 C it enters into ebullition but cannot be distilled without decomposition the thermometer rapidly rises and at 2300 C a copious deposition of iodide of tin takes place It would be interesting to study the action of zincethyl upon this body Stannic ethylomethide is more readily acted upon by aqueous hydrochloric acid than the corresponding ethyl compound a copious evolution of gas takes place and a crystal lizable salt is formed Submitted to analysis the gas yielded the following results I It did not contain any gases

of exactly onefourth of the positive groups in the stannic ethylomethide as was the case in the corresponding reaction with stannic ethide But the composition of the mixed gases does not permit of any safe conclusion being drawn as to the exact nature of the reaction It is obvious however that it is the ethyl group chiefly which is removed by the hydracid The analysis of the salt formed at the same time would no doubt supply the necessary evidence III Action of Zincethyl upon Iodide of Jercurrymethyl The formation of stannic ethylomethide in the manner just described encouraged me to attempt a similar reaction in the case of the iodide of mercurymethyla body which is formed under precisely the same conditions as iodide of stanethyl and to which I assigned the formula H g f3 regarding it as related to biniodide of mercury in the same manner as iodide of stanethyl is connected with biniodide of tin Mr BucK TONS announcement of the formation of mercuric ethide which from my point of view mus beregrde asH C4H1b1 a must be regarded as Hg 11 5 by an analogous reaction tended also to strengthen the hope that a mercuric ethylomethide might be thus obtained When iodide of mercurymethyl is added to pure zincethyl there is scarcely any action perceptible beyond the solution of the mercury compound nevertheless after the lapse of a few hours a copious deposit of iodide of zinc takes place The product obtained in this manner from two ounces of the iodide of mercurymethyl was submitted to distil lation it began to boil at 980 C the thermometer remained stationary for some time at 1200 C and then suddenly rose to 1580 C at which temperature nearly the whole of the remaining product passed over The distillate possessed in a high degree the powerful and unmistakeable odour of zincmethyl It was washed with water and dilute hydrochloric acid dried over chloride of calcium and rectified in an oilbath It began to boil at 1490 C but the thermometer rose almost immediately to 1550 between which point and 1570 C nearly the whole of the remaining liquid passed over The last drops distilled at 1650 C The portion distilling between 1550 and 1570 C was received apart and used in the following determinations I 4590 grm burnt with oxide of copper and free oxygen the mercury being collected in a drawnout portion of the combustiontube projecting from the furnace gave 3044 grm carbonic acid 1930 grm water and 3569 grm mercury II 4979 grm gave 3337 grm carbonic acid and 2101 grm water III 6338 grm gave 4918 grm mercury These results correspond with the formula of mercuric

10054 10031 The body perfectly agrees in all its properties with the mercuric ethyl obtained by Mr BUCKTON and to the remarks of that accurate observer respecting this compound I have not one word to add The entire absence of mercuric methide and the presence of zincmethyl amongst the products of the action of zincethyl upon iodide of mercurymethyl point to the following equation as representing the reaction H  HgC4 1152 H2  Zn C 113 2ZnC4 H6 IZn L This result indicates a mobility in the organic groups contained in these compounds which could scarcely have been expected IV Action of Zincrnethyl upon Chloride of Mercuryethyl Although the above reaction failed to produce mercuric ethylomethide it was still possible that this body might be formed by acting upon a mercuryethyl compound with zincmethyl For this purpose the iodide of mercuryethyl naturally suggested itself but as I found this body difficult to prepare in large quantity by the action of diffused light upon iodide of ethyl in presence of mercury I selected the chloride of mercuryethyl which was prepared by the following modification of the process suggested by Mr BUCKTON To an ethereal solution of zincethyl dried and powdered bichloride of mercury was added until the zincethyl was as nearly as possible all decomposed The liquid had then separated into two layersan upper one nearly solid consisting of a saturated solution of chloride of zinc in ether and a lower and more voluminous one composed of nearly pure and limpid mercuric ethide The latter which can easily be separated from the tenacious solution of chloride of zinc was washed with dilute acetic acid to remove a trace of zincethyl which it contained and then dissolved in fifteen or twenty times its bulk of alcohol This alcoholic solution was now poured upon a quantity of powdered bichloride of mercury rather less than sufficient to convert the mercuric ethyl into chloride of mercurous ethyl and the whole being heated to the boilingpoint the liquor was filtered whilst hot on cooling it deposited a copious crop of magnificent satiny crystals of chloride of murcurous ethyl perfectly free from bichloride of mercury and the motherliquor being repeatedly returned to the flask containing the undissolved chloride of mercurous ethyl the whole of the latter was finally obtained in a pure andDR E FRANKLANDS RESEARCHES ON ORGANOMETALLIC BODIES 411 crystalline form In this way the zincethyl from a single digestercharge produced upwards of eight ounces of the chloride About five ounces of chloride of mercurous ethyl dried in vaeio over sulphuric acid were added to four ounces of a strong ethereal solution of zincmethyl Considerable heat was evolved and after fortyeight hours the product was distilled It began to boil at 600 C The thermometer was stationary for some time at 128 and finally rose to 140C when a mixture of zincethyl and zincmethyl distilled over whilst a perma nent gas was at the same time evolved The distillate was washed with weak acetic acid and dried over chloride of calcium On rectification a considerable proportion distilled between 127 and 1370 C and was collected apart The last few drops came over at 156 C Repeated rectifications of the product boiling between 127 and 1370 C did not serve to isolate any portion of the distillate having a fixed boilingpoint on the contrary it was evident that the range of the temperature of distillation became wider each time the operation was repeated A section boiling between 127 and 1330 C yielded on analysis 1368 per cent of carbon whilst another section boiling between 141 and 143 C gave 1671 per cent of carbon The formula HgC4 H5 requires 1475 per cent of carbon According to Mr BUCKTON mercuric methide boils at 960 C and mercuric ethide at 159 C consequently mercuric ethylomethide might be expected to boil at about 1280 C It is more than probable that mercuric ethylomethide was formed in the above reaction but subsequent distillations gradually transformed it more or less perfectly into a mixture of mercuric ethide and mercuric methide 2HgC4 fHgC H L2H3 HgC2 H3 V Action of Zinc upon a MJizture of the Iodides of Ethly and Methyl In a former memoir I pointed out that the vapourvolume of zincethyl allows that compound to be represented by the formula H Zn2 This formula would be more 4H5 firmly established if we could succeed in combining zinc with two radicals of different composition the iodides of methyl and ethyl mixed with an equal volume of anhy drous ether were therefore submitted to the action of zinc at 1000 C in a copper digester in the hope of obtaining the body Zn2g2 H In eighteen hours the decomposition of the iodides being complete the product was distilled from the digester at a temperature not exceeding 150 In order to prevent as far as possible the formation of any zincethyl which would be more difficult than zincmethyl to separate from the intermediate body if the latter were produced iodide of methyl in slight excess over the equivalent quan  Transactions of the Royal Society for 1855 p 266412 DR E FRANKLANDS RESEARCHES OR

temperature the remainder of the product which was considerable and consisted of pure zincethyl distilled over No evidence whatever was obtained of the existence of an intermediate compound containing both ethyl and methyl VI Zinernethyl The experiments detailed in the foregoing pages requiring the use of considerable quantities of zincmethyl my attention was directed to the preparation of this body in much largerquantities than could be obtained by the operations in sealed glass tubes described in my previous papers on this compound I found that the preparation of a strong ethereal solution of zincmethyl succeeded most satisfactorily in the copper digester used for the production of large quantities of the corresponding ethyl com pound in fact the decomposition by zinc of an ethereal solution of iodide of methyl is much more quickly and perfectly effected than that of a similar solution of iodide of ethyl Heated to 1000 in the copper digester three ounces by measure of iodide of methyl mixed with two ounces of anhydrous ether were perfectly decomposed in six hours On opening the digester a very small quantity only of gas escapedthe whole of the iodide having been transformed into zincmethyl On heating the apparatus in an oilbath the distillation began at 900 and was complete before the thermometer reached 140 C Compared with an operation for zincethyl with the same amount of materials a very large product was obtained Rectified it began to boil at 350 the thermometer gradually rose to 480 between which point and 510 nearly the whole of the remaining and larger portion of the liquid came over The product obtained between the two latter temperatures possessed the intolerable odour of zincmethyl was spontaneously inflammable to the last degree and in short had all the properties of zincmethyl on analysis however it was found to contain considerably more carbon and hydrogen than is required by the formula C2 H3 Zn whilst the last portion of the distillate boiling

above formula unless we adopt the exceedingly improbable assumption that it contains two volumes of zincmethyl vapour united with one volume of ether vapour without condensation On the other hand it accords closely with the specific gravity of the vapour of a mixture of zincmethyl and ether in the above proportions as seen from the following calculation Four volumes of zincmethyl vapour 65672 Two volumes of ether vapour 25567 391239 Two volumes of mixed vapour 30413 Found 31215 Without at present offering any decided opinion as to the nature of this body I may state that in repeated operations with large quantities of materials I have entirely failed in obtaining pure zincmethyl by acting with zinc upon a mixture of ether and iodide of methyl Repeated attempts to produce pure zincmethyl from zinc and iodide of methyl alone in the copper digester were also unsuccessful although this method generally succeeds in small glass tubes Iodide of methyl is not attacked by zinc at 1000 C even after long digestion an admixture of 3 or 4 per cent of ether is however quite sufficient to deter mine the action at this temperature but with so small a proportion of ether the whole of the iodide is never decomposed and it is impossible to effectually separate either this or the ether from the zincmethyl produced When the digester containing zinc and pure iodide of methyl is heated to any temperature from 120 to 2000 C the iodide is decomposed but at the lower temperatures the decomposition is never complete whilst at the higher ones little or no zincmethyl is produced the methyl being resolved into gases This anomaly in the results obtained from the same materials heated in a copper digester and in glass tubes is doubtless due to the difference in the conditions obtaining in the two cases In a glass tube halfimmersed in a heated oilbath a distillation of the internal liquid is constantly going on the vapour formed in the lower portion of the tube being condensed in the upper part exposed to the cooling influence of the air MDcccLIx 3 I414 DR E FRANKLANDS RESEARCHES ON ORGANOMETALLIC BODIES and flowing over an extensive surface of zinc in its descent But in a digester of thick copper the different parts of the vessel are owing to the high conductivity of the metal maintained at so uniform a temperature as to prevent any such distillation and circu lation of the liquid from taking place Regarding the body described above as a mere mixture of zincmethyl and ether incapable of being separated on account of the close proximity of their boilingpoints I anticipated a more successful result by mixing the iodide of methyl with methylic ether instead of vinic ether As methylic ether boils according to BERTHELOT at 210 C it was thought that no such difficulty of separation could arise the bodies employed would then in fact be exactly homologous with those so successfully used in the preparation of pure zincethyl on the large scale It was found that iodide of methyl mixed with oxide of methyl was readily attacked by zinc even at the temperature of the waterbath the following experiment was therefore made About three ounces by measure of iodide of methyl were placed in the copper digester with the usual quantity of zinc oxide of methyl well dried by passing over chloride of calcium was forced into the digester by a compression pump until it was thought that the volume of liquified ether would be about equal to that of the iodide employed The digester was then heated in a waterbath for three days The product obtained on distillation was very rich in zincmethyl it contained however traces of undecomposed iodide of methyl but this was easily got rid of by the addition of a few grains of sodium which forming sodiummethyl reacted upon the iodide of methyl in the manner I have already pointed outt On rectification the greater portion of the liquid thus obtained distilled at 430 a small residuum only coming over between 430 and 48 Both these portions yielded on analysis the same results viz 29592954 per cent of carbon and 7411710 per cent of hydrogen These numbers do not agree with those required for zincmethyl viz 25c25 carbon and 631 hydrogen they approach however to those which would be yielded by two equivalents of zincmethyl and one equivalent of oxide of methyl 2 C2 H3Zn2 C H3 02 which require 30A49 per cent of carbon and 762 per cent of hydrogen This result is therefore exactly homologous with that obtained by the admixture of vinic ether with the iodide of methyl In conclusion after an expenditure of many pounds of iodide of methyl I have been unable to obtain even the smallest quantity of pure zincmethyl by the use of a copper digester On the other hand in ethereal solution a much larger product is obtained than in the corresponding preparation of zincethyl owing no doubt to the lower tempe rature at which the crystalline compound of zincmethyl and iodide of zinc is broken up  Philosophical Transactions

zincethyl obtained in an operation in the copper digester is decomposed during the subsequent distillationone of the products of decomposition being metallic zinc in a finely divided state which is always found in large quantity interspersed throughout the iodide of zinc left in the digester The temperature required to expel the ethereal solution of zinc methyl from the digester is less than 1400 C whilst zincethyl cannot be wholly expelled below 190 or even 200 C 3 I 2

Ellwood Hendrick has applied the conception of relativity to human life in general Relativity and Life The North American Review CCXIII May 1921 Relativity teaches the following I There is no absolute freedom Freedom is relative always circumscribed Each man is bound in his relation to some other To move away is only to move into another such relationship 2 There is need of greater precision in thinking No single shib boleth suffices as a guide Not only should the rights and privileges be emphasized but also our obligations The world would be better if the consequences of our actions were thought out more accurately 3 Ignorance in action is an offense against the general welfare since understanding is one phase dimension of conduct In the choice of political candidates mere numbers of uninformed voters do not promote wisdom The vote of people is democratic But since they may know too little about the qualifications of a given candi date to guide their vote and since some official may be better qualified to make the appointment such appointment may secure a more repre sentative official hence be more democratic The exercise of the franchise should be considered relatively in order to spell progress 4 Character is a phase dimension of ability In industry one may exploit and ruin another today but himself be laid waste tomorrow We can never know the complete and ultimate effects of our every act But there is need of a greater consciousness of their consequences 5 When human rights are considered in their genetic relation ships they are found to be conditioned by obligations they emerge out of service rendered The rights of a child are really the obligations of its parents It would be interesting to apply the foregoing in the realm of religious life Might it not be discovered that this doctrine of relativity would work out into something like the Christian attitude of love for others  What Did Judas BetrayDid Jesus announce himself to his friends as Messiah  Or were the disciples when they thought they could forsake him and flee surprised to find they could not thus put him by  536CURRENT EVENTS AND DISCUSSIONS 537 Professor B W Bacon of Yale thinks Jesus did set himself forth as Messiah and as a contribution to the solution of the problem of Jesus selfconsciousness he seeks to show in the Hibbert Journal for April 1921 that what Judas betrayed was some event in the course of Jesus life which was capable of messianic interpretation on the part of the Roman officials ever watchful of usurpers That event Professor Bacon finds in the anointing at Bethany The narrative of the anoint ing is imbedded in the Markan account of Judas betrayal To the friends of Jesus his anointing meant Vive le Roil This is what Judas betrayed If the incident of the anointing was actually so crucial in determining the fate of Jesus it seems strange thatthe account of it given by the evangelist should not furnish some direct hint of this significance Is Supernaturalistic Belief Essential in a Definition of Religion Upon examination of such definitions as attempt to exclude the super natural element W R Wells answers in the affirmative the Journal of Philosophy May 12 1921 Religion involves a twofold beliefin the existence of a supernatural order of reality and in the need of human adjustment to this order These objects may or may not exist but religion depends for its existence upon the belief in them The super natural order is the sphere transcending the natural order as we know it It has its philosophical basis in Platos celestial world and Kants nou menal world In its pre animistic form it was the unseen power while in its modern form as conceived by men like William James it is an unseen order It is the external divine source of religious experience as contrasted with that immanent source of which alone a naturalistic view can have knowledge That is a naturalistic view of the world cannot define religion In conclusion Though supernatural belief of some sort occurs in all religious experiences properly so called and in all accurate definitions of religion it might be claimed nevertheless that those persons ought to be called religious whose reactions to the universe as a whole to the cosmic drift of things were serious and reverent even though their philosophical view were naturalistic The majority of scientists would probably be included in this class The man of high moral ideals and serious purposes especially if his life is touched with deep emotion at the thought of the total cosmic situation ought hardly to be called irreligious perhaps even though he lacked all the usual religious beliefs Such a man is certainly not irreverent but it would be more accurate however to call such a man not religious but moral merely with538 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION esthetic emotions coloring his morality Regard for correct usage of the term requires that religion be defined in such a way as to include supernaturalistic belief In the interest of clearness it would be desirable to discuss the foregoing question from a different angle It is generally agreed that religion is not primarily a matter of belief but rather one of practical atti tudes of cult of worship of propitiation of gods The term super naturalistic belief turns the discussion to a debate over a definitely formulated dualistic philosophy embodied in Christian theology and thus distracts attention from the real questionwhich is whether religion is not essentially a means of enriching life through relationship to a morethanhuman environment How to Commend Christianity to NonChristian PeoplesAn interesting narration of his recent trip to the Near East was given by Sherwood Eddy in an article entitled The Christian Approach in the Near East International Review of Missions April 1921 He spent five weeks in Egypt and one month in Turkey Though the audience was composed of Turks Armenians Greeks Catholics and Protestants yet he found no difficulty however in presenting his Christian message The significant fact was that the large majority of Turkish students by the very process of modern education have lost their old faith and are almost without vital religion From his experience in dealing with such complex audiences Mr Eddy has been convinced that irenic method of approach is far more effective than polemic The moment a Christian speaker tries to contrast Christianity and Islam Christ and Mohammed he will imme diately arouse and call into conflict against him all their prejudice their patriotism and everything that they hold dear It was a tug of war If the speaker won the argument he would lose the audience But if instead of tearing down what the people have the speaker tries to give them something better instead of attacking or criticizing their religion he gives them a glimpse of richer life instead of reflecting upon Moham med he presents Jesus he is the more certain to appeal to their heart In other words the Christian missionary has to speak as man to man rather than as Christian to Mohammedan The Problem of the Christian Leader in ChinaTwo papers on the same subject The Training of the Future Leaders of the Chinese Church were read at Peking Missionary Association not long ago The author of one paper is Dr C H Fenn who has been in China twentytwoCURRENT EVENTS AND DISCUSSIONS 539 years while that of the other is Professor T T Lew of Peking University Dr Fenns paper is valuable because he speaks authoritatively from his rich experience He feels very strongly that the church should train both clergy and laity Besides the improvement of seminaries and Bible institutes there is a necessity of having correspondence schools and summer schools for Christian leaders Doubtless there are many potential leaders among the laity but they have failed simply because it is a custom of the church not to give any further religious education after they have been received into the church Professor Liu Chinese Recorder LII No 3 15877 looks at the problem from an entirely different angle His viewpoint is worth care ful consideration for he is the spokesman of many a Chinese Chris tian leader The missionaries have undoubtedly educated and trained many young men and women but they have also turned away many capable leaders because the latter who sooner or later have found it difficult to cooperate with missionaries are not given the necessary opportunity for practicing leadership They have been discharged when they tried to extend their service beyond the mission compound or have not been allowed to specialize their training according to their ability The church cannot afford to have such a waste This leakage must be stopped at once The Religious Renaissance in ChinaThe most significant development in new China is the New Thought or New Culture move ment Its influence on the religious life of the Chinese is well described by Lewis Hodous in an article  China Revisited Christian China Vol VII No 6 292 The new movement is at present at least on the part of its advocates hostile to religion It not only opposes superstitious beliefs and customs but also considers religion itself as superstitious On the other hand some religions in China have somehow caught this new spirit The Confucianists are working hard to revive Confu cianism An attempt has been made to adapt Confucian teachings to modern situations in China The liberalminded people are trying to start a Reformed Confucianism A campaign of 2000000 to build a national Confucian headquarters has been launched Buddhism is rebuilding its old temples publishing books holding lectures and establishing schools and orphanages A recent number of the New Buddhism published in Ningpo was devoted to an attack on Christianity Did Moses Use CuneiformThe theory that the Pentateuch was written in Akkadian and later translated into Aramaic and then into540 TIBE JOURNAL OF RELIGION Hebrew has been zealously advocated by Naville whose views have been defended recently by Doumergue This theory is sharply criti cized by J A Maynard in the Anglican Theological Review III March 1921 28489 and at greater length but no less incisively by P Humbert in the Revue de Thezologie et de Philosophie IX JanMar 1921 5993 A Valuable Review of Old Testament StudiesThe Jewish Quar terly Review XI April 1921 473542 contains an extensive review of more than twenty recent books on the Old Testament by J Hoschander The Death of Morris Jastrow Jr 186IIg92Morris Jastrow Jr PhD LLD professor of Semitic languages in the University of Penn sylvania died on June 22 The American Journal of Semitic Languages and Literatures of which he was associate editor from 1907 until the time of his death will publish in its October issue an appreciation of the significance of Professor Jastrows contribution to scholarship An alumnus of the University of Pennsylvania he began teaching Semitics in his Alma Mater and continued in that department until his death He was a recognized authority on Semitic religions having contributed to Hastings Dictionary of the Bible the Encyclopaedia Biblica the Jewish Encyclopedia the Encyclopaedia Britannica i th ed and Hastings Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics His most significant work is Die Religion Babyloniens und Assyriens 190212 More recently he has published A Gentle Cynic 1919 and The Book of Job 1920 In 1913 Professor Jastrow delivered the Haskell Lectures at Oberlin College Hebrew and Babylonian Traditions Two Noted German Scholars HonoredProfessor Adolf Harnack of Berlin and Professor Karl Budde of Marburg have both just passed their seventieth birthdays Festival volumes in their honor have been published the one dedicated to Harnack containing interesting contri butions in the field of New Testament and church history and the one dedicated to Budde furnishing articles in the Old Testament field One wonders whether modern German scholarship is furnishing such stimulat ing leaders in research as these giants of a former generation The Death of a Noted OrientalistThe death of Felix Peiser founder and editor of the Orientalische Litteraturzeitung is announced in the issue for MayJune 1921 just after he had handed over his editorial duties to Dr Walter Wreszinski Dr Peiser was known as a scholar and a trainer of scholirs His chief interest was in AssyriologyCURRENT EVENTS AND DISCUSSIONS 541 from the historical standpoint Next to that he concerned himself with the history of the text of the Old Testament seeking especially to account for the transition from its original to its present form by his theory of glosses The Latest Phases of Dr Sandays ThinkingIn the last years of Dr Sandays life he was led to give expression to the final resolution of his theological views especially his views on two closely related matters miracle and the authorship of the Fourth Gospel Both of these ques tions had been with him from the beginning of his career As for miracle he had hesitated about taking holy orders because of the difficulties he had felt in regard to this I began as a theologian by deliberately putting it aside I decided that my best course was to hold it in suspense  I began by taking up a neutral position on the subject of miracle The sort of general conclusion at which I arrived might be called conservative or liberalconservative To thisfrom his last public utterances as Lady Margaret Professor he adds with pathos Then the theological world was pleased with me and it still reminds me of those better days All his mature studies had been sketches preparatory to the main work of all his aim The Life of Christ Professor W Lock in the Journal of Theological Studies January I921 writes But it was becoming clear that that aim would never be achieved Time was slipping by very rapidly and there was another reason it was necessary to make up his mind more decidedly as to his attitude to the gospel miracles This had always been an anxious problem with him he had tried to hold the balance between the traditional view and the claims of a rather rigid theory of the uniformity of Nature but by 1912 the balance had gone against the traditional view He could no longer accept though he hesitated to say that he rejected the Virgin Birth the literal Resurrection and Ascension of the Lord and the Nature Miracles In 1912 and 1913 men were saying Sanday has gone over to the Modernists This left its mark on his sensitive soul I do not dis claim the name of Modernist he writes at the end of his life The occasion which brought forth the clearest expression of his attitude to miracle was the controversy which called forth his open letter to the bishop of Oxford Bishop Gores Challenge to Criticism 1914 There Dr Sanday distinguishes between miracles that are supra naturam and miracles that are contra naturam With the former he can live the latter class which includes the Feeding of the Five Thousand the542 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION Walking on the Water the Virgin Birth and the bodily Resurrection all of which seemed to involve real violation of the order of nature he thought were not strictly historical I should be inclined to seek a solution under the general heading that the element of the abnormal came in not so much in the facts as in the telling As with the question of miracle so with the problem of the author ship of the Fourth Gospelthroughout his long active life he never got very far away from it His first publication in 1872 was entitled The Authorship and Historical Character of the Fourth Gospel He came to be regarded quite generally as the ablest defender of the apostolic authorship and his name more than any other gave weight to the tra ditional opinion This intimate biographical note also from Dr Lock is of more than passing interest There synchronized with this change about miracle partly induced by it a change in his view of the authorship of the Fourth Gospel He was partly affected in this by Mr E F Scotts book on the Gospel which seemed to him to picture an adequate situation out of which the Gospel could have arisen but the deciding influence came from the article in the eleventh edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica by Baron von Hilgel At the last Dr Sanday wrote Im afraid there is one important point on which I was probably wrongthe Fourth Gospel How the Versailles Treaty Injures Missionary WorkOne of the darkest pages of recent events is that which tells the story of the treat ment of German missionaries by the governments and missionary societies of the Allied countries It has been a heavy blow to missionary progress and international good will The story of this unChristian attitude toward our German fellowChristians is told in the message from the German Students Christian Alliance to the Glasgow Con ference  Young Men of India June 1921 Since 1914 about 1400 missionaries have been withdrawn from German mission fields in many parts of the world The sections where the results have been most disastrous are parts of British India Egypt Togoland and German East Africa In many places the results of from forty to eighty years of faithful work have been practically lost through the complete with drawal of all forces Churches are disintegrating mission property is falling to ruin schools are without teachers and the native peoples are beginning to lose faith in the value of Christianity While the host of missionaries wait in Germany for the opportunity to return the other countries cannot supply the workers for the needy fields Even if they were available they would be untrained and ignorant of theCURRENT EVENTS AND DISCUSSIONS 543 language Moreover the missionary activities of the church in Germany are being paralyzed by such conditions With the demands so urgent for every available worker in spreading the gospel of good will and brotherhood such a procedure is surely a crime against humanity May the church speedily rise to a higher plane of international brother hood and cooperation The Church and WorldFellowshipWhat is the churchs responsi bility to the modern task of education for worldfellowship In his presidential address at the eighteenth annual convention of the Religious Education Association at Rochester New York March 1013 Presi dent Arthur C McGiffert defined worldfellowship as meaning Firstthe absence of distrust and jealousy and hostility between peoples and nations Seconduniversal and mutual goodwill leading men every where to help each other wherever help is needed as we here in America have been aiding the Chinese famine sufferers and the starving children of the Central Powers though they are personally quite unknown to us Thirdworldfellowship must mean worldwide cooperation in common tasks Where there is international hatred and enmity of course there cannot be worldfellowship But the thing itself comes to reality only when there is worldwide cooperation for worthy ends The fitness of the Christian church to further worldcooperation rests upon its doctrine of universal brotherhood upon its interest in spiritual rather than material values and upon its service in providing a laboratory of experience for the practice of efficient cooperation in unselfish enterprises It is a high calling to which the church is sum moned by Dr McGiffert The address is printed in Religious Educa tion for June 1921 The Milwaukee ConferenceThe fortyeighth annual meeting of the National Conference of Social Work held at Milwaukee June 2229 was attended by some 3000 people The aim of the conference was the examination of the present status of social work in America and a study of ways and means for increasing the efficiency of the agencies for social betterment President Allen T Burns director of methods of Americanization of the Carnegie Corporation struck the note for the conference in his presidential address on the theme Does Social Work Promote Social Progress The address in the main was an argument for the intelligent study of values in social work indicating the need of scientific research and attention to the organic relationships of social laws in any efficient scheme of social progress544 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION The program of the conference represented a wide scope of interests including contributions from social workers of many types psychiatrists physicians government workers criminologists sociologists and econo mists Labor conditions were discussed by Sidney Hillman president of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America Prohibition What Is Its Effect by J L Gillin professor of sociology in the Univer sity of Wisconsin and Immigrant Heritages and How to Deal with Them by R E Park of the University of Chicago The conference will meet in Providence in 1922 As One Having AuthorityThe boy in Nazareth had his schooling in a carpenters shop in the village street and out on the hills of Galilee Lincoln learned from the same bookswork with his hands elemental people and the lonely backwoods of Kentucky This was education for individuality for creativity for leadership But what child nowa days has such teaching asks Dallas Lore Sharp in Teaching for Authority in the Atlantic Monthly for July A child cannot be educated for authority on lesser books with sophisticated people with pointless play instead of work with ordered lessons in school in place of the dear dis order of nature and her companionship and his own souls The task of American school education is the mighty making of the democratic mindthe average mind It is education in the interests of leveling lifes extremes averaging up and averaging down to produce a com mon democratic uniform level of life But where is the education for poetry for prophecy for genius to find its place The challenge of the article is not to the schools but to the parents of today It is they who must provide for the education for authority Mr Wells and ReligionWe are unanimous in our interest in the mental processes of Mr Wells Groping ineffectually for an under standing of his mental daring and his prolific power as manifested by his literary output in recent years we welcome any examination of the operation and the results of his thinking Many who shrink slightly from the controversial examination of the History by Mr Wells and Mr Gomme in the Fortnightly Review and the Yale Review will welcome with interest the expository article by Mr A E Baker in The Living Age for July 16 reprinted from the Church Quarterly Review for April on The Religious Development of Mr Wells Between the earlier stages of Mr Wellss religious thinking which Mr Baker characterizes as reluctant agnosticism and the later fervent apostleship of God the Invisible King four main influences are recognized i Mr WellssCURRENT EVENTS AND DISCUSSIONS 545 interest in utopias or ideal states 2 the realization of the solidarity of the human race 3 the belief in a supranational authority and 4 the sense quickened by the war of God as an immediate helper and savior of mankind The dominant interest of the resultant religious consciousness is suggested in the lines quoted from Mr Wells Man kind will awake and the dreams of nationalities and strange loyalties will fade away and there will be no nationality in all the world and no king nor emperor nor leader but the one God of mankind Pre dominantly sociological rather than theological or ethical such a con cept of religion asks of course for supplement from other fields Mr Baker very rightly suggests its failure to bear comparison with the ideal of Jesus who stated the rights and duties of individuals in concretely ethical terms and defined the nature of the GodKing in the warm vital symbols of human personality and fatherhood Remnants of a Jewish Sect in ChinaAn interesting survey of Jews in China has been given by Mr W C White in the June number of the Church Missionary Review The Jews came over to China as early as the third century AD and settled in many important cities But at present the only Jewish community left in China is that in Kaifeng Honan There are about two hundred families at that locality They have sold all their Hebrew scriptures partly because they are poor and partly because they are no longer able to read them They have given up circumcision because they no longer understand the reason and tradition concerning it Their synagogue buildings have been com pletely destroyed As a religious entity they are quite disintegrated and their clan relationships are almost nonexistent Furthermore many have intermarried with the Chinese While many have followed Chinese customs and beliefs there are others who come to Christian churches on Sunday Was the God of Jesus the God of the JewsIt is infrequent indeed that scholarship and particularly scholarship in the field of religion is criticized for its neutrality Perhaps Mr Edmond Holmes in his article Does Contemporary Scholarship Do Justice to Jesus in the July issue of The Nineteenth Century and After is right in his contention that complete impartiality in the sphere of religious sentiment is beyond the grasp of human thought In any event Mr Holmes has presented an interesting challenge to the position of Dr FoakesJackson and Dr Lake in their first volume of The Beginnings of Christianity that the God of Jesus was the God of the Jews Their attempt to be fair546 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION to Judaism and to free themselves from any taint of partisanship has Mr Holmes maintains withheld them from a just estimate of the originality of the thought of Jesus and the revolutionary character of his teaching about God Mr Holmes is assuredly right in his position that there is other evidence to be considered in such a question than the specific utterances upon the theme in question The general outlook on life and attitude toward its practical problems furnish criteria both legitimate and decisive for scientific criticism Out of this larger field of evidence Mr Holmes brings his testimony He shows that there was implicit in Jesus attitude toward the Jewish law a conception of God less limited and less legalistic than the conception which Jewish theology had produced and he suggests that in Jesus attack upon other similar problems of the day there is abundant evidence of the originality and unorthodoxy of his thought about God How to Christianize the Chinese FamilyShanghai College has a new idea of solving this difficult problem The college has founded a Christian Home Club with the purpose of bringing wholesome ideals definitely before the students through addresses exhibits and personal contact with Christian homes of the faculty Both Chris tian and nonChristian students are allowed to become members on an equal basis The club is too young yet to ascertain the full results of this experiment but valuable testimony from students shows how the seed has already been sown Here are typical comments I owe so much to the C H C The things 1 learned there I am trying to work out in my home I am starting a C H C here in the school where I am teaching But now I know that my home can be made sanitary and attractive that my wife and I can be companions and that our Christian home may be a blessing to many others Recognizing the Social Background for Mission EducationPro fessor Paul Monroe points out in his article entitled Mission Education and National Policy International Review of Missions Vol X No 39 pp 32150 that there are at least four distinct types of culture in the foreign fields i that of tribal life 2 that of people who are highly cultured but are in the period of transition 3 that of people who have adopted definite procedures for realizing their national aims 4 that of people who are under foreign mandates Each type has its own dis tinctive problems Mission education should take the total environ mental conditions into consideration and adapt itself in such a way as to aid the natives for whom it laborsCURRENT EVENTS AND DISCUSSIONS 547 Whats Wrong with the Catholic Missions in ChinaThis inter esting question has been raised by George M Stenz a Catholic priest in the July number of the Ecclesiastical Review He has keenly felt that the Catholic missions have failed to reach the upper ranks of Chinese life This is largely due to the fact that the Catholic school situation in China is still in a most deplorable condition and the consensus of Catholic opinion has not awakened to the importance and the actual necessity of producing books treating of other subjects than those referring directly or exclusively to religion He also hopes that the Catholic benefactors in America will furnish funds not merely for the erection of chapels but also for the support of the Catholic schools and the Catholic press and of some capable converts to complete their education in America Coeducation and Mission Schools in ChinaThe time for co education has at last come to China The National Educational Conference of I919 in Shansi voted coeducation for China The same conference meeting in Shanghai the following year discussed ways and means of encouraging coeducation The Peking Government Uni versity has opened its doors to girls and has now more than ten coeds The Nanking Teachers College starting coeducation during the summer session of 1920 has more than one hundred girl students Among missions schools the opinions are still divergent Some entirely ignore the problem others have decided to start coeducation and still others stick to their traditional policy Mr Chang in his article on Students Social Problems The Chinese Recorder Vol LII No 5 PP 32935 points out that mission schools should not only have definite policies toward coeducation but also be active and careful in directing the social intercourse between young men and women This is especially important now for the old ethical standards have been discarded while the new ones have not yet crystallized History for EverybodyFew serious books have awakened more popular interest and called forth more scholarly criticism than Mr H G Wellss The Outline of History In the Yale Review for July Mr Wells answers his critics at length in delightful rollicking spirit driving home his reply with the announcement of the preparation of a new edition To Mr Wells this was a serious task to set forth the sweep of events It was written to help oust such teaching of history as one still finds going on in Englandof the history of England from io66 to the death of Queen548 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION Anne for example without reference to any remoter past or to the present or to any exterior worldforever from the schools For the work of some American historians he has warm words of com mendation eg for Professor Breasted but severe words for the British universities with their exaltation of the classical studiesa worldwide nuisance and as a patriot a parent and a schoolmaster I have raged against them He talks of wishing to take some younger critic across his knee and establishing a truer relationship in the simple way boys have But withal the new Outline will benefit by the criticisms he adds What Are the Real Relations between Christianity and Judaism Back to the study of Jewish sources is the answer to the present stress on Hellenistic influences in the effort to recover the story of the rise of Christianity To that end Professor G F Moore in Christian Writers on Judaism Harvard Theological Review July 1921 has this to say of Emil Schtirers History of the Jewish People SchUrers volumes are an indispensable repertory for all sorts of things about the Jews  He did what he set out to do and made an immeasur ably useful handbook But the reader must take it for what it is not for what its author notwithstanding the title never intended it to behistory   To Schiirer Judaism was synonymous with legalism and legalism was his most cherished religious antipathy  The problem of the origin of Christianity historically conceived demands however an investigation of every other phase of Judaism at the beginning of our era and the endeavor to define what Christianity took over from Judaism as well as what was new in it Wundts Conception of ReligionWilhelm Wundts Significance for Theology is considered by K Thieme in the Zeitschriftfiir Theologie und Kirche MayJune 1921 pp 21338 Wundt regarded theology as the science of religion and religion as consisting of historical phe nomena As an exponent of collectivism he looked upon the relation of the community to individual existence as the problem of problems His last work Erlebtes und Erkanntes published shortly before his death shows that he synthesized experience and knowledge into a worldview For him religion was the feeling that the world of sense belongs to an ideal supersensuous world so he counteracted the natural ism of Haeckel and Ostwald partly on the basis of a mystic experience in his youth He held to the unity of the religious and the philosophical treatment of the world the rights of religion side by side with science and experiences of worth as conditioning a worldviewCURRENT EVENTS AND DISCUSSIONS 549 On TranslatingFor the person who uses the Bible only in English it is often real service of emancipation for someone to remind him that his New Testament is a translation and that the art of translating has a history Frederick Harrison in the Forum for June has gathered together some brief notes on translation which must impress the student of general literature with the advance our age has made in this art The laws of translation he says are threeone exact rendering of the full meaning two some echo of the original form three clarity grace vigor in the translation He proceeds All through the eighteenth century almost down to living memory in the nineteenth century famous translations were produced in defiance of the first two canons of translation aiming only at clarity grace and vigor in literary English neglecting the meaning of their author and substituting a totally different rhythm of their own The most brilliant example of this was Popes Iliad And he shows how something of fidelity to the original something of the feel of the original which the first readers had has come into the new versions to take the place of that elegance of style which the litterateurs of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries made the desideratum But his dictum on the English Bible provokes a word Take the supreme case of the Bible of which the Authorized Version formed the mastertype of the English language To the millions the power of the Old Testament is due to the sublime effect of a unique translation from the Hebrew and to me the New Testament in English is grander than in the Greekitself being largely a translation of other tongues The 1611 Version is one of the enduring monuments of Elizabethan English it has left its stamp indelibly upon all our literature since and upon the language of every day as no other influence hasand that for many reasons But Greek is the original not the secondary language of the New Testament and much water has flowed under London Bridge since that translation much more than since Popes Iliad Some vigorous thinking is embalmed for us in the King Jamess English The new renderings eg Moffatts and Weymouths are pointing the way to a better day The Authorized Version will remain a classic but the New Testament writers have a right to be understood today The translation English of the Revised Version will yield to idiomatic stately English with some echo of the original form

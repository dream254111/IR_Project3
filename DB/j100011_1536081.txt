from diverse groups of invertebrates Recently the field has been extended to the vertebrates Guyer having shown their existence in the males of the guinea oga rooster o9b rat IO and man Io Newman and Patterson Io in the armadillo Jordan II in the opossum Stevens 11 in the guineapig and King 12 in Necturus The existence of what appears to be such an element has also been reported in the ovary of the cat by Wini warter and Saintmont o9 In a recent paper Jordan 13 states that the heterochromosomes are unquestionably lacking in the pig I find however that the accessory chromosomes are very conspicuous in all of the pig material which I have studied 8SPERMATOGENESIS OF THE PIG Wilson og found in Syromastes that half of the spermatids possess two more chromosomes than the remainder It was predicted by him that in consequence the somatic cells of the female of this species would show two more chromosomes than the somatic cells of the male and later the facts were found to be in exact accord with his predictions the somatic cells of the female of Syromastes having been found to contain twentyfour those of the male twentytwo chromosomes A similar condition has been found in other tracheates but dimorphism in the number of chromosomes in the germinal and somatic cells of the two sexes among the vertebrates has thus far been only inferred not actually demonstrated The present study on the spermatogenesis of the pig was taken up at the suggestion of Professor M F Guyer to whom I am much indebted for many helpful suggestions during the progress of the work Points of special interest in this paper are as follows I The presence of a distinct pair of accessory chromosomes 2 The resulting dimorphic condition in the spermatozoa of the pig 3 Dimorphism in the number of chromosomes in both the germinal and somatic cells of the male and female animals 4 The abundance of large conspicuous interstitial cells in the testes 5 The second reduction of the chromosome number in the secondary spermatocyte which was found to be simply equa tional 6 The throwing off of a large mass of cytoplasm containing one of the centrosomes at the time of the final development of the spermatozoan MATERIAL AND METHODS I have been very fortunate in obtaining from several sources exceptionally good material for this investigation The major part of the material studied was obtained from a vigorous Poland China boar about ten months old The animal came from registered stock and was the property of the College of Agri culture of the University of Wisconsin The material was ob 9J E WODSEDALEK tained through the courtesy of Professor L J Cole Immediately after the testes were removed from the live animal pieces were placed in various kinds of fixing fluids as Bouins Zenkers Tellyesnickys and corrosiveacetic Sections from various parts of the testes were made from four to twelve microns thick and while several methods of staining were employed material fixed in Bouins fluid and stained with Heidenhains iron hematoxylin with acid fuchsin as a counter stain proved to be the most satisfactory Delafields hematoxy lin with eosin counterstain was also used and gave favorable results While material fixed in some of the other fluids men tioned was fairly good the first method proved to be so superior that the sections used in this study were almost wholly those prepared according to it Other material from a much older animal was studied in sufficient detail to corroborate the results obtained through the study of the material secured from the younger and more vigorous animal I also owe many thanks to Professor B M Allen for his generosity in placing at my disposal his embryological material of pigs of both sexes The material in question which was that used by Dr Allen 04 in his own researches on the embryology and development of the ovary and testes in mammals was fixed in Flemmings fluid and stained with Heidenhains iron hema toxylin mainly By examining a large number of these slides I not only corroborated my previous count of the spermatogonial number of chromosomes but was also able to make fairly con clusive counts of the chromosomes in the somatic cells of the male and in the o6gonia and somatic cells of the female With out the use of his material this important phase of the problem could not have been worked out at this time GENERAL ARRANGEMENT OF THE GERMINAL CELLS The structure of the testes of the pig does not differ greatly from that of other wellknown mammals except for the presence of numerous masses of large welldefined interstitial cells which are scattered among the seminiferous tubules and comprise about one fourth of the entire volume of the testes Fig I A detailed description of these interesting cells which contain IO0SPERMATOGENESIS OF THE PIG numerous mitochrondia will be reserved for a separate paper The germinal cells themselves are found in a great number of seminiferous tubules coiled throughout the interior of the testes Sections of the tubules are found in groups of fifteen to twenty five which are completely surrounded by walls of connective tissue This connective tissue forms a sort of continuous net work of walls throughout the testes and is rather thick in places usually where three or four of the groups become appressed Embedded in these walls are blood and lymphvessels which branch out into the masses of interstitial cells between the tubules The arrangement of the cells in the tubules is similar to that of the other warmblooded animals and the usual four types of germinal cells are present The spermatogonia form a more or less regular layer of cells lying next to the wall of the tubule These divide and give rise to two new cells one or both of which may become the primary spermatocyte The primary spermato cytes are very abundant especially in the spireme stage After various changes and considerable growth the primary spermato cytes divide and give rise to the secondary spermatocytes The secondary spermatocytes divide in turn to form the spermatids which transform directly into spermatozoa Figs 6478 The material studied must have been in maximum activity at the time of fixation for the four types of germinal cells were easily found in stages of growth and development Mitotic stages of spermatogonia primary and secondary spermatocytes were very abundant and frequently the entire field under the oil immersion lens was composed of cells in mitosis Spermatozoa in all stages of development were very abundant and clusters of the cells which were in the final stages of develop ment could be seen attached to the long cylindrical Sertoli cells which often extend to the lumen of the tubule Figs 2 and 3 The Sertoli cells which are quite abundant are closely connected with the germinal cells and will be described in more detail later Fig 63 SPERMATOGONIA The spermatogonia usually lie in a single layer next to the wall of the tubule though occasionally some of the cells are IIJ E WODSEDALEK crowded out thus forming a second layer which is always very irregular There is considerable variation in the appearance and some variation in the size of different spermatogonia Very frequently the cells are far apart in which case they are flattened out on the tubule wall The amount of cytoplasm is small and in some of the earlier stages the cell boundaries are very indistinct Fig 16 Later the nuclei assume a round shape and the cell wall becomes visible The amount of chromatin material increases and the nuclei at this stage resemble very much the nuclei of the large interstitial cells both in appearance and size Fig I7 Two large nucleoli much alike in size seem to be present in all stages of these cells Even in the testes of young embryos the two bodies are very conspicuous Besides these large nucleoli a varied number of smaller similarly staining bodies are usually present two of which seem to occur most frequently and evi dently make their appearance first Figs I6 and I7 Later other small nucleoli appear At present I am unable to attach any meaning to them as their numbers are so varied in the various cells The two large nucleoli however are very constant and I have been able to trace them throughout the entire spermato genesis From all appearances one is led to believe that these nucleoli and the accessory chromosomes are one and the same a condition similar to that found by Guyer io in man and by others in some of the lower forms Jordan i  however has not been able to identify any such structures at this stage as the future accessory chromosomes in the opossum At the conclusion of the resting stage numerous chromatin granules appear which arrange themselves along fine threads in an entangled mass The two nucleoli come in close contact and the nuclear membrane gradually disintegrates Eighteen chro mosomes appear in the late prophase of the spermatogonial division Fig I8 Sixteen of these are rodshaped variously curved and somewhat different in size Two which are always found close together and frequently off to one side are slightly larger and oval in shape The sixteen ordinary chromosomse or autosomes arrange themselves with the two accessory chromo somes in the equatorial plate Fig I9 The accessories like 12SPERMATOGENESIS OF THE PIG the autosomes divide in this stage A centrosphere containing a tiny centrosome can be observed in some cases but its presence is not at discernible in these early cells as it is in the later stages PRIMARY SPERMATOCYTES I Resting Stage The primary spermatocytes which arise from the final sperma togonial division in the early resting stage are usually somewhat smaller than the spermatogonia in the metaphase and prophase stages The two large nucleoli are quite conspicuous and remain black in sections stained with iron hematoxylin even in very much destained material Fig 20 Usually two small nu cleoli stained the same way as the large ones are plainly visible and occasionally only one or more than two of these bodies appear 2 Synizesis and Growth Period An increase in the bulk of both the nucleus and cytoplasm begins after a brief period of rest The chromatin appears to be arranged in much the same way as it was during the resting con dition of the spermatogonia except that the linin fibers are coarser The cytoplasm is composed of granular masses and clear apparently liquid areas The chromatin threads and nucleoli become massed at one side of the nucleus Fig 2I The nuclear wall expands and the clear area formed by the massing of the chromatin to one side becomes much enlarged The clear areas in the cytoplasm decrease coincidentally with the increase of the liquidlike area in the nucleus and one is led to believe that the cytoplasmic fluid permeates the nuclear wall during the period of synizesis During the collapse of the chromatin material the nucleoli can be plainly seen especially in well destained sections Fig 2I They are usually in that portion of the chromatin mass which is nearest to the nuclear wall Opposite this mass on the outside of the nuclear wall a centrosphere can often be seen but the centrosome is rarely visible at this stage The chromatin threads become arranged in a very much tangled mass of loops which later appear in about half the original number and fully twice as thick I have not been able to determine definitely whether 13J E WODSEDALEK the pairing takes place by telo or parasynapsis The whole mass then moves toward the center Fig 22 the large clear area in the nucleus disappears and the nuclear wall becomes spherical and clearly defined Fig 23 While the formation of the spireme is going on the cytoplasm too increases greatly in volume and appears very granular The cell now is fully twice as large as a spermatogonium and judging by the large number of cells that can be seen in the spireme stage one can safely conclude that they remain in that condition for some time The spireme finally breaks up into U and variously shaped chromo somes Fig 25 The two large nucleoli which remain in full view throughout this stage become oblong and can often be seen close together Fig 25 3 Reduction Division The primary spermatocytes when ready for division reveal ten chromosomes in the late prophase or early metaphase stage The two accessories which are ordinarily off to one side Figs 8 26 27 and 29 can be recognized at a glance The other chromo somes are usually arranged in a ring Judging from their large size and changed form they are bivalent representing the paired univalent chromosomes of the spermatogonium That is of the original eighteen chromosomes sixteen have paired to form eight bivalents of the primary spermatocyte and two have remained unpaired as the accessory chromosomes Sometimes although ten chromosomes can be counted it is difficult to tell just which are the accessories owing to overlapping The chromosomes differ somewhat in size as can be seen in Figs 26 to 29 Figs 9 to 12 and 30 to 37 show the accessories in characteristic posi tions in the metaphases of division of the primary spermatocyte They always pass entire side by side and in advance of the divided autosomes toward one pole This is possibly due to the fact that they are not retarded by division The fact that the chromosomes immediately after divergence Fig 28 resume the appearance except in size that characterizes the univalent spermatogonial chromosomes and also because the accessory chromosomes pass over entire to one pole in this division while they are halved in the next division seems to indicate strongly that this is the reduction division 14SPERMATOGENESIS OF THE PIG It is obvious that as far as chromatin content is concerned the division of the primary spermatocyte gives rise to two dissimilar cells one of which receives eight chromosomes and the other eight plus the two accessories or ten chromosomes Fig 38 Figure 39 is a drawing of one end of a late anaphase of such a division showing eight chromosomes and Fig 40 shows the other end which received eight of the ordinary chromosomes and the double accessory Occasionally a small chromatin body is present in this first spermatocytic division Figs 28 31 32 35 and 37 Figure 31 shows such a body passing to the same pole with the accessories in advance of the other chromosomes Figure 32 represents an earlier stage of much the same thing In Fig 35 it can be seen passing to the opposite pole and Fig 37 represents an extremely rare case where two such bodies are present one somewhat larger passing to either pole even in advance of the two accessory chromosomes Figure 28 shows the body outside of the main ring of chromosomes While the small body can be seen fre quently as a rule no such an element can be detected and while it may possibly be comparable to the small pair of chromosomes found so constantly in some of the Tracheata my present data on its irregular occurrence and behavior do not permit a conclusion regarding its significance SECONDARY SPERMATOCYTE I Dimorphism The dimorphism of the secondary spermatocytes which re sulted from the last division is again expressed in the resting stage that sometimes follows Approximately half of them showed under proper decolorization two large chromatin nucleoli Fig 41 while in the others only the small nucleoli appeared Fig 42 The nucleoli retain the usual deep staining capacity and as was true in the previous stages even when all the other material is almost totally decolorized the nucleoli remain very conspicuous Frequently both primary and secondary sperma tocytes were found dividing in the same field which fact seems to suggest that at times there is no intervening period of rest be tween the two divisions or that it is very brief Figure 43 I5J E WODSEDALEK shows the two resulting cells of a primary spermatocyte division which are still in close contact and both ready for dividing into spermatids Resting stages however appear in abundance and in this stage as was the case in the resting stage of the primary spermatocyte the centrosome surrounded by a clear zone becomes large and very conspicuous Figs 41 and 42 2 Second Reduction Division Equational Although the division of the primary spermatocyte gave rise to cells containing eight and ten chromosomes respectively Figs 38 39 40 when these cells become ready for division half of them show four Figs 13 14 43 45 46 and the other half six chromosomes Figs 43 44 47 Thus a second pairing of the ordinary chromosomes similar to that found by Guyer in the pigeon oo corroborated by Geoffrey Smith I2 man Io guinea o9a and chicken o9b and by Jordan in opossum II has evidently taken place so that there are four bivalents in each type of cell and the additional two accessory chromosomes in the one type Stevens I  says that there is no such second synapsis or numerical reduction in the guineapig Figures 45 and 46 show four large chromosomes in the metaphase stage of one type of secondary spermatocyte and Figs 44 and 47 represent the other type in which six chromosomes appear four bivalent autosomes plus the two accessories The four chromosome group is evidently formed by the pairing of the eight chromo somes of one type of cell resulting from the first maturation divi sion at one pole and six chromosome group is interpreted as being derived by the pairing of the eight chromosomes plus the two unpaired accessories at the opposite pole Figs 38 39 40 Guyer io in speaking of the second conjugation of the chro mosomes in man says Assuming that the respective chromosomes are more or less qualitatively differentiated such a numerical reduction however by no means necessarily implies that there has also been a second qualitative reduction Aside from the improbability of such a reduction the general appearance of the divided chromosomes would not warrant this interpretation for instead of the elon gated univalent type as seen in the spermatogonia or in ana I6SPERMATOGENESIS OF THE PIG phases of the divisions of spermatocytes of the first order the daughter chromosomes here retain the rounded appearance and increased size that is characteristic of the bivalent types com pare Figs I Io and II 13 14 15 I6 and I7 Thus while half of the spermatids receive five and half seven chromosomes in terms of univalence the numbers would in all probability be ten and twelve respectively Jordan I I in speaking of the same condition in the opossum remarks as follows Similarity of form between the chromosomes of the first and second metaphase plates i e double rods suggests a similar manner of division accordingly a second reduction When one recalls however that a resting stage Figs 39 to 41 usually intervenes between the first and second maturation divisions when the chromosomes pass through a reticular phase the above conclusion is inadmissible or rather no definite conclusion respecting the character of the second division is justified A double true reduction suggested by the form of the chromosomes is contrary to our fundamental conceptions regarding the signifi cance of chromosomes and need not in view of the nature of the evidence be seriously considered Moreover in the stage just preceding the brief resting phase of the spermatids Figs 57 58 and 59 there occurs a resolution of the five chromosomes into nine and of the four into eight This demonstrates that the true character of the second division is equational The second numerical reduction involves a less close union apparently than the first as a comparison of illustrations 29 and 43 will show Again the fusion is sometimes incomplete to the extent of giving an occasional count of six chromosomes My own belief that the real character of the second division in the case of the pig is simply equational is based on a number of facts Even after the first maturation division the ordinary chromosomes are much larger than the spermatogonial univalents This increase in size has evidently taken place during the growth period of the primary spermatocyte compare Figs I8 and 38 During the prophase of the secondary spermatocyte the chromo somes apparently increase still more in size and four large bi valent autosomes appear for division in the one type of cell and I7J E WODSEDALEK four plus the two accessories in the other type Not only is the bivalent nature of these large autosomes conspicuous but very frequently a quadrivalent character is discernible and they are much larger than the accessories Figs 44 45 46 and 47 During the anaphase the bivalent nature of the chromosomes is often clearly visible at each pole Figure 49 shows four bivalents and is a drawing of one pole of the dividing cell which received eight chromosomes during the first maturation division Figure 52 is a drawing of one pole of the division of the type of secondary spermatocyte which received eight ordinary chromosomes and the double accessory It will be seen that four of these are bi valent in nature while two are univalent the two univalents being the results of the division of the two accessories Figs 44 50 and 51 both of which have here divided for the first time since the spermatogonial division The bivalent nature of the autosomes after the second spermatocytic division becomes even more conspicuous in cases where these chromosomes divide into two before they break up Figure 56 shows an early spermatid cell which received the four bivalent autosomes and the two accessories It can be seen that two of the autosomes have almost completely divided The bivalent nature of the other two can also be plainly seen while the accessories retain their univalent appearance Thus it can be seen that the spermatids produced by this second division do not receive four and six chromosomes respectively but four bivalents or the equivalent of eight univalents are present in the one type of cell and four bivalents or eight univalents together with the two accessories in the other The foregoing facts seem to indicate beyond doubt that the second maturation division is not a reduction but simply an equational one Figures 50 and 54 represent an anaphase of division in a secondary spermatocyte showing two streaks of lagging chro matic material Although several such cases were observed ordinarily no such pronounced streaks occur Fig 5I Guyer found a similar condition in the secondary spermatocyte division in man and suggests that it may be the two accessories lagging behind Although many accurate counts of the chromosomes in this second division were made they were so massed together I8SPERMATOGENESIS OF THE PIG as to render a count impossible Fig 54 Not infrequently the chromosomes in the early spermatids become closely appressed before they begin to break up Figs 53 and 57 Sometimes the individuality of the chromosomes is apparent even after the nuclear wall begins to form Fig 58 SPERMATIDS From the foregoing evidence it is obvious that there exists a dimorphism among the spermatids one type containing eight and the other ten chromosomes after the last division The chromosomes soon become irregular in shape and begin to break up and the spermatids appear all alike except that immediately after the chromosomes disintegrate two nucleoli are visible in approximately half of the cells Figs 64 and 65 These retain for a short time the staining capacity characteristic of the nucleoli of the previous stages but later disappear and the whole nucleus assumes a coarse granular appearance The cells seem ingly remain quiescent in that condition for some time as they are nearly always found in large numbers The centrosome sur rounded by a clear layer is again very conspicuous within the comparatively small centrosphere which lies close to the nucleus Figs 64 and 65 DEVELOPMENT OF THE SPERMATOZOA Following the period of rest the spermatids begin to develop into spermatozoa There is no perceptible change in the size of any of the parts such as described by Jordan in the opossum The first change to be detected is the extrusion of the centrosome surrounded by a light area from the small sphere Fig 66 It takes a position a short distance from the nucleus and soon begins to divide The two new centrosomes move apart and one somewhat rodshaped comes in contact with the nuclear wall but it remains connected by a mass of material with the other centro some which assumes a disk shape and for a while remains in place Figs 67 68 and 69 The disk is frequently perforated in the middle and has the appearance of a ring Fig 70 Simultaneously with the division of the centrosome a portion of the sphere which remains in close contact with the nuclear wall I9J E WODSEDALEK migrates to a point directly opposite the centrosome in contact with the wall on the other side Figs 66 67 and 68 The sphere in this process of migration is in such close contact with the nuclear wall that a slight depression can be detected in the latter The depression is even more pronounced when the clear sphere becomes definitely fixed as the small acrosome Figs 6875 In the guineapig the acrosome which becomes nearly as large as the nucleus itself according to Meves 99 is also formed from the centrosphere or idiozome While in the rat according to Lenhossek it is independently formed in the cytoplasm without relation to the preceding mitotic figure or the centro somes Meves 97 also found that in the salamander the acrosome is formed from the idiozome which wanders around the nucleus to its anterior pole McGregors results on Am phiuma 99 agree in general with those of Meves except that here the acrosome arises from only a part of the centrosphere while a second smaller part passes to the base of the nucleus and forms the main part of the middlepiece Coincidentally with the division of the centrosome and the migration of the small sphere the nucleus together with these structures moves to one side of the cell in the direction of the acrosome and soon prac tically all of the cytoplasm is at the posterior end of the cell Figs 66 67 68 69 and 70 The cell wall seems to persist as a thin mantle covering the head of the spermatozoan The anterior part of the cell bearing the acrosome almost invariably points in the direction of the tubule wall while the mass of cytoplasm extends into the lumen Fig 2 Most of the chromatic material of the nucleus gathers at the center into a dense mass which has the same staining capacity as characterizes the chromosomes and the centrosome Sometimes two or three masses are present Figs 73 74 and 75 Soon after the division of the centrosome into a cylindrical anterior and a discshaped posterior body a divergence of the two follows but they remain connected by a streak of material Fig 69 The inner body upon coming in contact with the nuclear wall forms a depression in the latter and its anterior portion shapes into a disc which comes in close contact with the nuclear wall in the small depression at the posterior end of the 20SPERMATOGENESIS OF THE PIG nucleus From this disc which is apparently the endknob a cylindrical mass of material extends backwards uniting the two centrosomes Figs 68 and 69 A tiny filament extending back ward from the middle of the posterior discshaped centrosome makes its appearance and is undoubtedly a continuation of the coarser filament which unites the two centrosomes Fig 69 As the tail grows longer the connecting filament becomes thinner and the posterior centrosome which after division was disc shaped and had increased somewhat in size becomes trans formed into a ring and it can be seen that the filament extends directly through it and continues backward as the tail Fig 70 The formation of the ring takes place simultaneously with the rapid growth of the tail and one is led to believe that the perfora tion in the disc is partly due to the fact that the material formerly occupying that space goes to help in building up the axial filament Shortly after the tail projects out of the cell the ring moves along the filament backward and soon swerves over to one side in the cytoplasmic mass Figs 71 and 72 Very frequently it can be seen a considerable distance away from the axial filament long before the latter is fully developed Figs 73 74 and 75 This seems to indicate that the posterior centrosome takes no further part in the development of the filament and that the latter is mainly developed from the anterior centrosome no part of which is discarded or thrown off While most of the inner centro some passes into the formation of the axial filament a part of it remains as the endknob in the small middlepiece Figs 76 and 78 a condition similar to that found by McGregor in Am phiuma 99 The posterior ringshaped centrosome after moving away from the filament sometimes divides Fig 73 but usually assumes a spherical shape Fig 74 and an interesting point in connection with this body is that during the final development of the spermatozoan it is invariably thrown off with a big mass of cyto plasm Figs 74 75 and 76 The casting off of a portion of the cytoplasm during the last stages of the developing spermatozoan has been described by Meves 99 in the guineapig where it is closely similar to the process which occurs in the spermatozoid formation in ferns but the throwing off of a portion of the 21J E WODSEDALEK centrosome together with the mass of cytoplasm has not hereto fore been to my knowledge recorded The body usually stains as deeply as it does in the earlier stages for some time after the comparatively large mass of cytoplasm containing it is completely separated from the rest of the cell or young spermatozoan In general the behavior of the centrosomes in the development of the spermatozoan of the pig does not differ greatly from the conditions found in some of the other vertebrates However it might be well to briefly point out some of the differences In the spermatids of the salamander according to Meves 97 the two centrosomes lie quite at the periphery of the cell and from the outer one grows out the axial filament The two centrosomes leaving the idiozome by which they are first surrounded now pass inwards toward the nucleus the outer one meanwhile becoming transformed into a ring while the axial filament passes through it to become attached to the inner centrosome The latter pushes into the base of the nucleus and enlarges enormously to form a cylindrical body comprising the main portion of the middlepiece The ring divides into two parts the anterior of which gives rise to a small body at the posterior end of the middlepiece identical with the endknob The other part of the ring wanders out along the tail and finally lies at the limit between the main part of the latter and the endpiece In the pigeon according to Guyer oo the centrosome divides and moves out of the sphere and further away from the nucleus The two new centrosomes move apart but remain connected by a mass of material which later disappears and a very delicate fibril uniting the two centrosomes exists in its place One of the centrosomes enlarges and transforms into a complete ring The connecting fibril can later be seen passing from the smaller centrosome back through the ring and outside the cell The centrosomes next approach the nucleus and as they draw near a slight invagination appears in the nuclear wall and the small centrosome moves into it In the mammals the work of Lenhossek on the rat 98 and Meves on the rat guineapig and man 98 99 gives a result similar to the condition found in the salamander In all these mammals the young spermatids contain two peripherally placed 22SPERMATOGENESIS OF THE PIG centrosomes from the outer one of which the axial filament grows out and the centrosomes later move toward the nucleus In the pig the centrosomes are never peripherally located and division of the spermatid centrosome does not take place until it emerges surrounded by a small clear sphere from the main bulk of the centrosphere which is in close contact with the nucleus It can be seen from the drawings of the later stages that the nucleus gradually elongates and flattens Figs 6778 The large chromatic mass within the nucleus disintegrates and the particles become distributed at the periphery of the nuclear wall Fig 78 The tail envelope becomes apparent as the cell elongates and evidently develops from the cytoplasm Figs 74 78 It later comes in contact with the axial filament and en velops about half of its entire length The remaining extremely thin portion of the tail is apparently the naked axial filament Figs 76 77 78 When the cells reach the stage represented in Figs 7173 they attach themselves in bunches to the large cylindrical Sertoli or nurse cells that often extend from the basement membrane a long distance toward the lumen of the tubule Figs 2 and 63 As the spermatozoa continue to develop a gradual decrease in the volume of the cytoplasmic mass of the Sertoli cells is noticeable When the spermatozoa are apparently mature they abandon the Sertoli cells which at this time are very much collapsed The spermatozoa after leaving the nurse cells do not pass directly to the lumen of the tubule but remain scattered for some time among the masses of cytoplasm which were cast off by the same developing cells a short time before Figs 3 and 67 This cast off material does not scatter about in the lumen as one would suspect but forms a sort of loose layer next to the cells following the maturing spermatozoa The masses begin to disintegrate soon after they are discarded by the developing spermatozoan and when stained with ironhaematoxylin numerous black bodies make their appearance in this material Fig 3 The spermato zoa remain with their bodies embedded in this layer and tails extending into the lumen until the mass almost completely dis appears Then they become free in lumen of the tubule and are ready to make their way out of the testes During this period 23J E WODSEDALEK of attachment to the nurse cells and later to the discarded mass of cytoplasm the heads of the spermatozoa increase somewhat in size but retain the same staining capacity The foregoing facts seem to show beyond doubt that the developing spermato zoan derives nourishment not only from the nurse cells but also from the castoff cytoplasmic material When the sperm reaches maturity the acrosome disappears from view and the anterior edge of the head becomes well rounded In addition to the parts mentioned there appears very fre quently a dense spherical cytoplasmic mass represented in Figs 67 to 75 As to the origin and fate of this body I am not entirely certain It seems however that it is a portion of the centro sphere for in many of the early stages it was seen in the immediate neighborhood of the small body which later forms the acrosome Fig 67 Further evidence for this assumption is the fact that the combined mass of these two bodies seems to be equal to the size of the sphere in the stage immediately preceding Fig 66 The consistency of this body too is similar to that of the sphere Figure 78 represents a mature spermatozoan of the pig which appears rather simple in structure and form The entire nucleus of the spermatid has evidently developed into the head which is oblong and flat Figs 7078 The nuclear material breaks up into very fine particles which arrange themselves in a layer at the entire periphery of the head wall Fig 77 With Heidenhains ironhaematoxylin the head stains a sort of slate blue and is difficult to decolorize A depression is present at the posterior extremity which is in contact with a small middle piece The endknob which is for some time attached to the nuclear wall within the small depression Figs 74 75 and 76 finally breaks loose and passes to the posterior extremity of the middle piece the greatest portion of which now remains very clear in appearance This clear area is similar in appearance to the contents of the acrosome and one is led to believe that it is due to the presence of the substance which was seen in form of a clear sphere surrounding the centrosome after it emerged from the centrosphere and persisted about the two centrosomes particularly around the inner one after division Figs 6669 24SPERMATOGENESIS OF THE PIG 60 1 o  40 30 20 10 T 105 O 1 11 12 125 13 I35 14 145 15

the lengths of the heads of the spermatozoa in millimeters magnified two thousand times VARIATION IN SIZE OF MATURE SPERMATOZOA The spermatozoa of the pig vary considerably in size and careful measurements revealed the fact that they may be arranged in two separate classes one type being much larger than the other Mature specimens which were free in the lumen of the tubule and parallel to the objective were selected at random and outline sketches of four hundred heads enlarged X 2000 were made with the aid of a cameralucida The lengths of the sketches were then carefully measured and recorded in half millimeters Figure I in the text shows the variation in size of the four hundred heads measured It can be seen at a glance that two separate types of spermatozoa exist the greatest num ber of the one kind measuring from II5 to 12 mm and of the other type from 14 to I45 mm The increased size of the latter is due presumably to the presence of the accessory chromo somes RELATION OF THE ACCESSORY CHROMOSOMES TO SEX IN THE PIG Many investigators working on the problem of sex determina tion are of the opinion that the sex of a zygote is determined at the time of fertilization the spermatozoan in most cases carrying 25J E WODSEDALEK the determining factor This view has been recently substan tiated by the careful investigations of McClung Stevens Wilson Morgan Payne and others who found that in many invertebrates such as certain insects myriopods arachnids and nematodes two different kinds of spermatozoa are produced The spermatozoa differ from each other by one chromosome or by a group of chromosomes called the accessory chromosomes or Xchromo somes In some forms it was found that the spermatozoa each contain an accessory chromosome but that in half the sperms this chromo some was larger in its chromatin content than in the other These are called the X and Y elements respectively All the eggs produced except in a few cases on the other hand contain the Xelement It has been shown in some of the Tracheata that whenever an egg is fertilized by a sperm containing the Xchromosome it develops into a female while an egg fertilized by a sperm without the Xelement or by one containing the Yelement gives rise to a male individual In the vertebrates Guyer was able to identify an Xelement in such diverse forms as the guinea rooster pigeon rat and man and other investigators have recently brought forth similar evidence Patterson and Newman Io record its presence in the armadillo Jordan II in the opossum Stevens II in the guineapig and King I2 in Necturus Up to the present in vestigation however a dimorphism in the number of the chromo somes in the male and female vertebrates has not been recorded Guyer Io after speaking of the difference in the number of chromosomes in the somatic cells of the male and female Tracheata which possess the Xelements says In the light of these facts we should expect the somatic cells of man to contain twentytwo and of woman twentyfour chro mosomes The tissues of the female have not yet been studied with this in mind Flemming 97 records the somatic number of chromosomes determined from corneal cells as twentyfour but unfortunately he does not record the sex of the subjects from which the material was obtained If it were a female his count would bear out the interpretation given above 26SPERMATOGENESIS OF THE PIG The behavior of the accessory chromosomes in the various stages of the spermatogenesis of the pig further substantiates the fact that two different kind of spermatozoa are produced in mammals Since the dimorphic condition of the spermatozoa does exist the question arose whether this dimorphism holds true in the chromosome number of the male and female somatic cells With this in view I undertook an examination of sections of male and female embryological material supplied me by Professor B M Allen A large number of these sections were studied and although mitotic stages were not very abundant in any one section and the chromosomes were frequently bunched together rendering a count impossible nevertheless a number of counts of the chromosomes in the germinal and somatic cells of the two sexes were recorded It was again found that the spermatogonial number of chromosomes is eighteen and that the same number prevails in the somatic cells found in the mesonephros of the male embryos Two of the chromosomes are usually somewhat larger Fig 59 Sections of the female material revealed a count of twenty chromosomes in the o6gonia Fig 60 and the same number prevails in the somatic cells found in the mesonephros of the female embryos Fig 62 Four large chromosomes corre sponding to the two accessories in the male can usually be de tected in the oogonial cells In the somatic cells of the female there are also four large chromosomes present corresponding to the two accessories in the male cells and the four accessories in the oogonia Fig 62 In a few cases ten large chromosomes were found in the early metaphases of division in the somatic cells of the female Fig 6I Two of these are considerably larger and are interpreted as the result of the pairing of the four accessories The smaller chromosomes eight in number judging by their size are evidently due to the pairing of the sixteen other chromosomes The position of these cells would not warrant the supposition that they might be wandering germ cells Furthermore a similar condition was not observed among the o6gonial cells in spite of the fact that mitotic stages occur far more frequently in the sections of the ovaries than they do in the mesonephros In proportion to the large number of mitotic stages found in 27J E WODSEDALEK these longcontinued searches accurate counts of chromosomes in the cells of the various tissues were comparatively few How ever all cases where a count was possible were recorded and although they varied somewhat the above number of chromo somes eighteen and twenty attributed to the male and female cells respectively were the prevailing numbers The foregoing facts are in accord with the expectations and we have here in a vertebrate a condition verifying the results found in some of the lower forms In view of these facts it is obvious that the eggs carrying ten chromosomes or half the somatic number when fertilized by a spermatozoan containing ten chromosomes give rise to an individual containing twenty chromosomes in its cells or a female Those fertilized by the other type of spermatozoan which contains only eight chromo somes give rise to individuals with eighteen chromosomes in their cells which was found to be true in the male The results of the present investigation therefore add support to the chromosome theory of sex determination since they show that in the vertebrates as well as in some of the lower forms there exists a dimorphism in the number of chromosomes in the somatic as well as the germinal cells of the two sexes It is highly probable that conditions similar to those found in the pig as regards sex determination exist in man and in the other vertebrates which possess the accessory or Xchromosomes The resemblance in the behavior of the pair of accessories in the pig and their behavior in man is very striking and suggests that in all probabilities there exists a dimorphism in the germinal and somatic cells of man and woman SUMMARY I The usual four types of cells the spermatogonia primary and secondary spermatocytes and spermatids are discernible in the spermatogenesis of the pig 2 Large interstitial cells containing numerous mitochondria exist in great abundance and comprise about one fourth of the entire mass of the testes 3 Numerous Sertoli or nurse cells are present and great numbers of spermatozoa can be seen in all stages of development in the various tubules 28SPERMATOGENESIS OF THE PIG 4 Two large nucleoli are present in the resting stages of the spermatogonia These can be traced through the entire sper matogenesis of the pig and are apparently correlated with or are the same thing as the two accessories Smaller nucleoli usually two are also present 5 Eighteen rodshaped chromosomes differing somewhat in size occur in all of the spermatogonia where a definite count could be made Two of these undoubtedly the accessories can usually be seen to one side of the main mass of chromosomes 6 During the spermatogonial division the accessories divide and occasionally pass to the poles in advance of the other chro mosomes 7 The last spermatogonial division gives rise to cells which through a process of growth become the primary spermatocytes Both nucleus and cytoplasm increase greatly in size Synizesis followed by synapsis occurs 8 An apparently continuous spireme is formed which later breaks up into Ushaped and variously curved chromosomes A centrosphere containing the centrosome is present 9 The two large round nucleoli which remain very conspicuous throughout the process of growth of the primary spermatocyte come together and elongate during the late prophase 10 Ten chromosomes appear for division in the primary spermatocyte of which eight are evidently bivalent and two accessory The accessories are usually considerably to one side of the other chromosome I 1 The two accessory chromosomes which are out of the main spindle pass undivided to one pole in advance of the other chromo somes I2 The primary spermatocyte division is evidently the reduc tion division It gives rise to two cells one of which contains ten eight autosomes plus the two accessories and the other only eight chromosomes I3 The chromosomes in these daughter cells are larger than the univalents of the spermatogonia and show some indications of bivalence I4 The secondary spermatocytes formed by the last division ordinarily go into a resting stage In half of these the two 29J E WODSEDALEK nucleoli are conspicuous and lacking in the others In a few cases at least there is no resting period in the secondary sper matocytes A small centrosphere containing a relatively large centrosome is present I5 During the metaphase of the secondary spermatocyte one half show four large bivalent chromosomes and the remaining show the four large bivalents plus the two accessories or six chromosomes A second pairing has apparently taken place but the division is simply equational as the four large chromo somes often manifest a quadrivalent character The accessories remain unpaired I6 The quadrivalent nature of the autosomes in the secondary spermatocytes becomes all the more certain after division as the chromosomes passing to the poles are of the bivalent nature I7 The type of secondary spermatocyte which received eight chromosomes after the first maturation division gives rise to two spermatids each containing four bivalent or eight univalent chromosomes The other type which received ten chromosomes after the first maturation division gives rise to two spermatids each containing four bivalent or eight univalent chromosomes and the two accessories each accessory having divided here for the first time since the spermatogonial division I8 The dimorphic nature of the spermatids which develop into spermatozoa is further evinced by the presence of the two nucleoli in approximately half the cells The centrosome is again conspicuous I9 The first noticeable change in the transformation of the spermatid is in the centrosome It emerges from the small sphere and divides into an anterior rodshaped and a posterior disc or ringshaped body 20 Both of the centrosomes contribute to the development of the axial filament A portion of the anterior one persists as the endknob while the posterior body is finally cast off 21 A portion of the sphere migrates to the opposite side and gives rise to the acrosome which disappears when the spermato zoan is fully developed 22 The nucleus of the spermatid passes to one side of the cell elongates and flattens and forms the head of the spermatozoan 30SPERMATOGENESIS OF THE PIG 23 The axial envelope which extends a little more than half the length of the tail is developed from the cytoplasm 24 The half developed spermatozoa attach themselves to Sertoli cells where they continue to develop 25 The cytoplasmic mass of the Sertoli cells decreases greatly in size as the spermatozoa continue to develop Finally when the spermatozoa are almost mature a collapse of the nurse cells takes place when practically nothing but the nucleus and the cell wall remain 26 An interesting event occurs in the final stages of the devel opment of the spermatozoan when a large mass of cytoplasm together with the posterior centrosome is thrown off by the cell 27 When the spermatozoa desert the Sertoli cells they do not pass directly into the lumen of the tubule but remain scattered with their heads embedded in the layer of the castoff cytoplasm 28 The castoff cytoplasmic material is apparently used as food by the maturing spermatozoa and when practically all of the former disappears the fully developed spermatozoa become free in the lumen of the tubule 29 Measurements of the mature spermatozoa reveal the fact that they are of two distinct sizes a point no doubt correlated with the presence and absence of the accessory chromosomes 30 The somatic cells of the male contain eighteen chromo somes a number corresponding to that in the spermatogonia 3I The somatic cells of the female yield a count of twenty chromosomes as do the o6gonia 32 The foregoing facts add considerably to the support of the chromosome theory of sex determination since they prove that in the vertebrates as is true of some invertebrates there exists a dimorphism in the germinal and somatic cells of the male and female

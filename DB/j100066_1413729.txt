Communicated by E B TITCHENER and H P WELD XXXIV SIZE VS INTENSITY AS A DETERMINANT OF ATTENTION By J N CURTIS and W S FOSTER This study is an attempt to compare the attentioncompelling power of size and intensity in the case of Greek crosses A standard cross identical with that used by Meads 1 the arear of which was 56 sq cm was compared with two similar crosses whose areas were respectively 28 and 112 sq cm The apparatus used was that of Meads save that a pendulum tachis toscope was substituted for the spring tachistoscope The average time of exposure was also the same IIo sigma but the mean variation of this average was reduced from 8 to 3 sigma A 40watt Mazda lamp was used and the standard cross had the intensity of 225 of light Preliminary experiments by the method of limits indicated that re sults as definite and constant as those in which form and intensity were compared could not be obtained for size To rule out so far as pos sible any influence of expectation we turned in the regular series to the method of constant stimulusdifferences The experiments were arranged to compensate for the irregular influences of practice and fatigue and to measure the error of space The observers were Dr E G Boring Dr W S Foster and Mr F L Dimmick all highly practised All observers completed 200 series 50 with each of the two comparison crosses in each of the two spatial positions right and left of the standard The period of observa tion was approximately an hour in length and in general gave time for ten series Restperiods of three to five minutes were allowed twice during the hour The observer was not told the number of steps in a series nor did he get any indication of the point at which one series ended and another began The instructions which were read at the beginning of every experi mental hour were At now put your attention definitely upon the fixationpoint Two crosses of unequal size will be exposed Judge which of them if either is the more clear ie which one of them 1 Am Jour Psych xxvi I915 I50294 CURTIS AND FOSTER catches your attention the more The observers judged Right Left Equal or Doubtful but doubtful judgments were rarely given and are counted as equal Introspective reports were not re quired but were occasionally volunteered At the beginning of every hour a warmingup series with steps of approximately 30 were taken in which the values of the episcotister opening for the comparisoncross were varied at haphazard over a very wide range Such a preliminary series seemed essential in order that the observer should receive no suggestion from the experimenter as to what region was expected to be critical The observer knew that this series was taken for purposes of orientation as well as for warm ingup The judgments of the preliminary experiments exhibited reg ularity and served as a basis for determining the range and position of the succeeding regular series The latter could now be made out in seven to ten steps of 15 with fair assurance that their range and position were appropriately chosen The percentages were computed separately for each group of ten series In only I7 of the computa tions was the low percentage for the one endstimulus as great as 20 and in only 11 of them is the high percentage for the other end stimulus as low as 60 Even in these few cases such percentages are usually inversions We have assurance therefore that the range of values covered on a given experimental day is in general sufficiently great The position of the stimulusseries thus indicated for succeeding days however turned out to be much more variable than we had antici pated In the accompanying chart the intervals of uncertainty for the various observers and for the two spatial positions are represented by heavy vertical lines Their order from left to right is the order of practice and their positions are evident from the ordinatenumerals which are expressed in degrees of light of the comparisoncross Broken curves connecting the succeeding points of subjective equality are for the comparisoncross on the right solid curves are for the com parisoncross on the left After nearly half of the experiments had been completed it proved that even full intensity of the comparison cross was sometimes insufficient to make it as attractive for attention as the standard In such cases without knowledge on the part of the observers the experimenter decreased the intensity of the standard which accordingly became the variable In the chart the values for the interval of uncertainty thus obtained are represented as if a proportion ately increased intensity had been given to the comparisoncross though of course such representation is not strictly justifiable The dots enclosed in circles represent the averages of the points of subjective equality for each observer the two spatial positions being combined The effect is that of combining the broken and solid curves for a given observer and a given size of cross and reducing them to a single point The figures following the i sign are the mean varia tions of these points from the averages If we may trust these gross averages it seems that the larger cross must be slightly more intense than the smaller in order to exert equal power over Bs attention Moreover the smaller cross which is only half the area of the standard catches his attention equally well if its intensity be increased by only 8 of light indeed if it is placed to the left of the standard it catches his attention at a much lower in tensity For F size seems in general to have very little attentioncompelling power The smaller cross must be increased by 67 to become equallyMINOR STUDIES FROM CORNELL LABORATORY clear but the larger cross catches his attention at an intensity no whit lower than the standard which is only half its size For both B and F therefore the standard appears to have been of a size to compel attention somewhat more easily than either a smaller or a larger size D requires that the smaller cross shall be much more intense and the larger considerably less intense than the standard if they are to catch his attention equally well In the case of one observer B spatial position makes a greater difference in attentioncompelling power than a fourfold increase in area In terms of the chart that is to say his two broken curves occupy more nearly the same position than do his broken and solid curves for a cross of a given area His M Vs accordingly are large IIo and 102 In the case of the smaller cross another observer D also has a large M V though in this case it is dependent not on position but upon wide daily variability which in a lesser degree is characteristic of all observers All of these facts taken together added to the facts of wide individual differences seem to us sufficient indication that under our conditions size is not a definite determinant of attention We have no explanation for the apparent relative stability of the interval of uncertainty during the single experimental hour and the wide variability of its position upon different days Since its position was roughly determined each day by preliminary experiments over a wide range of possible positions and since within the groups of ten series there is a fair degree of regularity in the percentages we do not think it possible that the experimenters choice of values and a selfimposed tendency to give approximately equal numbers of Right and Left judgments were responsible Our observers find as a rule that the judgment is made without difficulty At first B was not certain that his judgments were judg ments of clearness alone and thought that the natural judgment was perhaps one of clearness and intensity combined At first he tried actively to make the judgment solely in terms of clearness later he takes the experiment more passively and finds that as he does so an intensityclearness fusion seems to be built up Certain intensity values force themselves in under passive attention as invariable con comitants of the clearness At first he was also somewhat disturbed by the fact that at times the crosses especially the larger one seenled unevenly illuminated over their surfaces After a few hours how ever he no longer mentions such difficulties and settles down to what is apparently a constant attitude He does not seem to realize that the smaller cross at even lesser intensities is often judged clearer than the standard He does remark that when the smaller cross is the clearer it is a bright cute mean little thing and gives him the cute little devil attitude He suspects that what really happens is that when the little one does catch attention Im surprised that it should in spite of being so little I know that Im not disposed for the little one quite sure I do not anticipate it The smaller cross snaps at me the larger one rather swoops at me F finds no difficulty in making an immediate judgment except when the crosses seem to be equally or nearly equally clear and he vol unteers few remarks D was somewhat disturbed at first by the fact that all three crosses seemed to change in size from experiment to experiment within a series although he knew that objectively they were constant The clearer cross often seemed to be closer to him in space and also to come earlier in time 295296 CURTIS AND FOSTER Our results were obtained under special conditions and with few observers So far as they go however they show that size does not possess the definite compelling power of form and intensity and that other factors must have been at work to produce the individual dif ferences If this result is confirmed the comparatively uniform in fluence credited to size in the case of advertisements 2 must be regarded as doubtful other factors than the apparent factor of size may there have been in play 2 See eg H F Adams Advertising and its Mental Laws 1916 Cf W D Scott Psychology of Advertising I912 157 ff H L Hol lingworth

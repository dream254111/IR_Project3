highest work Unquestionably the stations ought to make practical experiments in the study of the problems before them But in the longrun those stations will do best that plan their work most philosophi cally and the prosperity of the enterprise as a whole will be pro portioned to its success in the discovering of the laws that underlie the right practice of agriculture In brief the ultimate success of the stations will depend upon the discovery of principles This is accomplished only by patient profound costly research no small part of which has to do with the findingout of the best methods of investigation of special prob lems But while this work is essential the stations are confronted with the necessity of doing what will directly and immediately help the farmer The need and value of abstract researpch are not un derstood To show its usefulness and help prepare the way for the stations to prosecute it and at the same time do some of the things that are most immedintely and pressingly needed in these directions is one of the important ways in which the department may aid the experiment station enterprise TtIE NEW BUILDINGS OF THE SORBONNE PARIS THE people of France have never doubted the utility and necessity of the Sorbonne During the long ancl splendid history of the Sor bonne to quote from Atctvre they have had ample experience of the value of a great teaching body in the capital and the result is that this is one of the institutions in which men of all parties take a common pride So long ago as I855 it was decided that new buildings for the fSorbonne should be erected but the scheme was not really com plete until I88I It was then estimated that the expense would be 22000000 francsa formidable enough sum but one which caused no serious difliculty as thb city readily undertook to con tribute half of it The foundation was laid ln I885 and now a considerable part of the work is finished This was opened on Aug 5 in the presence of President Carnot and the ceremonies on the occasion may be regarded as affording fresh evidence of the enthusiasm felt by educated Frenchmen for all that represents and tends to develop the highest intellectual life of the nation Every university had been asked to send delegates elected by the students to the celebration and the State and the city of Paris agreed to look upon them as their guests during the ten days of festivity in honor of science This part of the program me was well car ried out arrangements having been made with different hotels to t13oard and lodge the foreign visitors at the expense of the Hotel de Ville and the Ministry of Public Instruction Russia and Germany did not accept invitations but the universities of Great Britaill of the Scandinavian countries of Belgium Holland Greece Switzer land Italy Spain and the United States were represented There were about 700 delegates from these countries besides a large number who went at their own expense The exercises began on Sunday evening with a gala performance of Faust at the Opera House which the President attended Vn Monday the sth 3ooo persons assembled in the new amphi theatre an immense hall adorned with frescoes Each delegation had a standardbeFrer carrying the flag of his nation ancl the members of the various groups were warmly greeted by the public as they advanced to the places appointed for them At 3 oclock Presidentn Carnot arrived and took his seat on the platform sur rounded by ambassadors statesmen and academicians M Ferry as the minister who made the arrangements for the enlargement was much cheered M Greard rector of the Academy made the first speech He sketched the history of the Paris University extolled the events of I789 and described study as a common fatherland which had brought together delegates from nearly all the  European and American universities M Hermite next reviewed the mathemati cal teaching of the Sori2onne since I808 M Chautemps President vof the Municipality vindicated democracy from the imputation of indifference to culture and claimed credit for the body represented by him for having founded a chair of French revolution history and a chair of evolution M Fallieres lVIinister of Education dwelt on the efforts and sacrifices of the republic for the diffusion of culture tIe referred to the moribund condition of the universities on the eve of the Revolution and the want of cohesion between the col leges afterwards established and eulogized the individuality now developed by the provincial universities THE MARINE

periments which provided the basis for them Directions and in structions are given for the designing and construction of simple and compound engines and also for making accurate tests of their efficiency Chapters are given on aircompressors and refrigerating machines which important subjects may profitably be studied ir connection with the theory of thermodynamics Though this volume like all similar textbooks is largely an adaptation for a special educational purpose of the work of other authors and experimenters more than a general acknowledgment of indebtedness to them would not under the circumstances be deemed necessary still Professor Peabody has given references in footnotes wherever direct quotations have been made which will aid students materially in making more extended investigations AMONG THE PUBLISHERS D APPLE1 0N  CO call attention to the fact that  Christianity an3 Agnosticism  has gone into a second edition Messrs Houghton WIifflin  Co announce for

BeaZ Engznes BY CECIL H PEABODY New York Wiley 8 5 THE author of this book is associate professor of steam engi neeriltg in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the book is intended mainly for the pse of students in that and similar technical institutions He presents in a clear manner and with a minimum of mathematical expression the general theory of ther modynamics and his treatment of the properties of gases and va pors and of the injector presents sexeral novel and interesting features especially in the comparisons with experiments More novel stil and more valuable to the student who intends to adopt steamengineeling as a profession is the authors treatment of the steam engine He has considered it advisable to leave untouched all approximate theories based upon the assumption of adiabatic changes of steam inthe cylinder of the engine making instead a systematic study of actual tests of engines in use for which pur pose a arge nurober of test recoTds harJe been collected arranged and compared This will enable the student to learn what is ac tually known on the subject and will point out to him the direction in uhich luture investigations wil gire the best results as well as show him how and where improvements may be made It vvill be gathered from the foregoing that this book differs in some parts either in substance or in manner of presentation from other textbooks on the subject but in general commonlyaccepted Inethods have been followed The formal presentation of thermo dynamics is the same as that employed by most authorities and presents clearly the many difficulties of the subject besides making plain the processes employed The author gixes cpecial attention to the inxestigations of the

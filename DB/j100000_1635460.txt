in the chair Several in formal notes were presented Mr F E Matthes offered some notes on snow and winter insects collected in the vicinity of Washington Among the true snow insects especial interest attaches to Boreus nivalis Neuroptera This insect is com mon in the northern states but has hitherto been considered rare in the District of Columbia On Christmas day 1908 and at various times in Jan uary 1909 it was found in abundance in Rock Creek Park On the date first mentioned two of this species were observed mating on the snow On the same day large numbers of winter insects belonging to the Hymenoptera were gathered in the same locality They represent the winter generation of two Cynipid gall flies consisting of hermaphroditic individuals whose larval stages are passed in the roots of oak trees They ovi posit in the young buds of the same tree thus producing the galls on the leaves in which the summer generation develops It appears essen tial according to observations by Dr E A Schwarz and others that the ovipositing be done as soon as the buds show the first signs of life in spring It takes place therefore about the end of February as a rule In view of this it seems surprising that the insects should have been found at so early a date as December 25 almost two months prior to the first budding of the leaves The difficulties attached to any studies whereby the winter generations of these species might be connected with the corresponding summer genera tions have thus far proved almost insuperable and as a consequence no definite correlation ex ists as yet For the present the individuals of the winter generation which look quite unlike the summer generation are referred to the genus Andricus Both Andricus species found have atrophied wings those of the larger species being apparently perfect but about half the size neces sary for flight They thus possess a character istic also found in Boreus In the male of the latter however the wing remnants are of an imperfect and strangely aberrant type Mr M B Waite exhibited a Jonathan apple having a peculiar decay The specimen repre sented a lot which had been shipped from Colo rado to Los Angeles California kept there in coldstorage and then sent to Washington for diagnosis Three species of apple rot fungi found in the decayed spots were considered secondary since most of the decayed areas were free from fungi or bacteria The discolored areas often in the form of a band around the apple were firm in texture light brown in color and extended to a moderate depth in the flesh of the apple The cells in the discolored areas were collapsed and ruptured thus coinciding with frost injury The damaged area was concluded to be due to freezing or since the apple stands freezing to the peculiar conditions of thawing out after freezing Dr H M Smith announced and commented upon the transfer of the administration and per sonnel of the federal furseal service to the Bureau of Fisheries Dr B W Evermann reported an observation made by his brother A M Evermann near Bur lington Indiana showing that fox squirrels some times feed upon the seeds of the cocklebur Xan thium strumarium The observation was made January 19 when snow covered the ground The squirrels carried the burr to a log at the edge of a field and there got at the kernels by gnawing away one side He also reported the capture of a barn owl in Carroll County Indiana in December 1908 This species had not been previously recorded from that county The regular program consisted of the following four papers Bee Diseases E F PHILLIPS The honey bee Apis mellifera is subject to several specific diseases which are well recognized among practical bee keepers The causes of all of them are not fully understood Two of these attack the bee in its embryonic stages and are now designated American foul brood and Euro pean foul brood They attack the bee just about the time that pupation begins and the colony is depleted because as the adult bees die from nat ural causes there are not enough bees emerging 438 SCIENCEARCH 12 1909 SCIi to replace them The cause of American foul brood has by inoculation experiments been de termined to be Bacillus laraes This organism grows well only on a medium prepared by mash ing healthy bee larvae and sterilizing by filtration Fifteen minutes of boiling is required to kill the spores of the bacillus The cause of European foul brood is not known There are other mal adies of the brood and of the adult bee The methods of treatment and means of spread were discussed Federal Control of Fisheries in International Waters B W EVERMANN lIe discussed briefly the questions of federal control of migratory birds of migrating fishes of interstate waters and of international waters Attention was called to the valuable work which the Hon George Shiras III has done and is still doing in calling attention to the power of the government in matters such as these which experience has demonstrated can not be properly handled by the respective states When a mem ber of Congress Mr Shiras introduced two or three bills providing for federal control of migra tory birds and fishes and one providing for fed eral control of interstate waters On April 11 1908 a convention was entered into between the United States and Great Britain according to the terms of which uniform regula tions will be provided governing the fisheries on the United States and Canadian sides of our northern boundary The special International Fisheries Commission appointed under the treaty is now drawing up its report which must be sub mitted to the respective governments by June 3 This report it is understood will contain a complete system of regulations for the fisheries in all international waters between the United States and Canada A Remarkable Flight of Bats in Luzon HUGH M SMITH He presented notes on a remarkable flight of small bats observed by him near Montalban Luzon P I on December 31 1907 At 540 PM a solid column of bats began to emerge from a large cave about 1200 feet above the Mariquina River The bats flew rapidly in a straight un broken closelypacked line for fifteen minutes and disappeared over a mountain range in the direction of Manila without a single bat having left the column American engineers at the place reported that this flight had occurred at practic ally the same time each day during the two years they had been there and from other sources it NGXh 439 was learned that the same thing had been ob served for at least thirty years 4 Visit to the Bat Cave in Luzon PAUL BARTSCII He described the cave from which came the flight of bats referred to by the preceding speaker The cave is a large one Its main entrance is about 35 feet high and 25 feet wide and difficult of access A short passage connects the entrance with the central dome which has a diameter of about 150 feet and height of about 200 feet and perforates the mountain top From this cham ber passages open in various directions frequently expanding into large rooms some of which have wonderful stalagmites and stalactites while others are simply glazed with a glistening lime deposit An hour and a half was spent going from cham ber to chamber and the native guide stated that he might continue for half a day without re tracing his steps Bats of several species Were seen flitting about or clinging to the wall of the cave everywhere but not enough to make a hun dredth part of the swarm seen on the night of the last of December 1907 Owing to the failure of the bat flight the previous night July 4 1908 the party had expected to find dead bats in the cave believing that some epidemic might have killed them This seemed the probable solution since on their previous visit the party had been assured that the bats had never been known to fail to make their appearance at a certain hour for many years Careful search of the floor which was richly covered with guano failed to reveal any dead individuals and the whereabouts of the immense flight remains a mystery at present M C MARSH Recording Secretary THE CHEMICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON THE 188th meeting of the Washington Chem ical

WASHINGTON AT the 428th regular meeting of the Society held at the Cosmos Club February 2 1909 the following program was presented A Newly Discovered Siouan Dialect DR JOHN R SWANTON Dr Swanton visited the small remnant of Tunica Indians living close to Marksville La in November 1908 for the purpose of correcting and amplifying the linguistic material recorded by Dr Gatschet over twenty years ago In the course of his investigations he had the good for tune to find a single survivor of an Indian tribe formerly living on the Yazoo River and known from French accounts as Offogoula A sufficient vocabulary was obtained to show that the lan guage spoken by them was not Muskhogean as had hitherto been supposed but a Siouan dialect related to those of the Biloxi and the eastern Siouan tribes It is peculiar in substituting f for s in many situations and tc for y in others The proper name of the tribe is Ofo and prob ably has nothing to do with Choctaw ofe dog as has hitherto been supposed Exhibition of Ethnographic Specimens by Mem bers of the Society Dr I M Casanowicz exhibited a silver lamp with eight burners used by the Jews in the Hanuga ceremony the origin of which was ex plained at some length This lamp is the prop erty of Ephraim Benguiat of New York Dr Casanowiez also showed a design representing a globe made of the book of Ecclesiastes in Hebrew characters in a single line Mr Edwin P Upham of the Smithsonian In stitution exhibited and gave the place of origin of a series of stone scrapers and a series of stone axes A general examination and discussion fol lowed on the part of the members of the society JOHN R SWANTON Secretary THE BIOLOGICAL AND GEOLOGICAL SECTION OF THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCE AND ART OF PITTSBURG AT a regular meeting of the section on Feb ruary 2 Mr F G Clapp spoke on the  Influence of Geological Structure on the Occurrence of Oil and Gas Mr Clapp briefly discussed the  anti clinal theory of White and Orton and indi cated the other factors which must always be considered in connection with it in order to make determinations of practical value The following generalizations were made in regard to the fields of southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia 1 All conditions being favorable the accumu lations of oil and gas do show a definite rela tion to the geologic structure 2 With but few exceptions the greatest elon gation of the pools is approximately parallel to the axes of the folds 3 When both oil and gas are present in a stratum of sandstone they are distributed ac cording to their densities the oil in the lower and the gas in the higher portion of the layer 4 When oil and salt water are present the oil generally occurs in the part of the stratum lying directly above the water level 5 When salt water is absent the oil may oc cur at the bottom of the syncline or may be part way up the anticlinal slope 6 Oil may occur on a  structural bench where the dip of a stratum changes from gentle to steep 7 Gas occurs mainly near the crests of anti clinal folds 8 It occurs however in greatest volume in certain portions of the anticlinal crests which take the form of structural domes 9 Gas occurs in volume also at many widely scattered points due to local changes in the dip and texture of the rocks The unconformity at the base of the Pottsville formation was briefly described and the state ment made that in certain fields it has a decided influence on the relation existing between the position of the oil and gas deposits and the geo logical structure as determined by the surface rocks In general the interval between the sur face rocks and the deeper oil and gas  sands diminishes toward the north and west and this change frequently shifts the axes of the anti clines and synclines in the deeper sands a frac tion of a mile from the position of the same axes in the surface formations Other changes in the intervals between the various sands must be taken into account in locating oil or gas deposits PERCY E RAYMOND Secretary 440 SCIENOCE

4thly That charcoal is not an oxide of carbon since when rightly prepared it requires quite as much oxygen for its combustion as diamond And lastly That the diamond differs from charcoal solely in the firmness of its aggregation which is generally known to be an ob stacle to every chemical change An Account of the Relistian Tin Mine By Mr Joseph Carne in a Letter to Davies Giddy Esq MP FRS Read May 7 1807 Phil Trans 1807 p 293 Mr Davies Giddy communicated a letter from Mr Joseph Came giving an account of the Relistian Mine in Cornwall in which rounded pebbles were found at the depth of seventyfive fathoms from the surface The description is accompanied with a section of the mine and plan of the lode The lode has been seen at various depths from twelve to ninety fathoms but its width then diminishes rapidly toward the east but more gradually toward the west The substances not metallic are schist chlorite and quartz There is an engineshaft at eight fathoms from the lode on the north side from which levels are driven to the lode in the direction of a flucan or cross lode which cut the main lode nearly at 450 from NW to SE The distance in this oblique direction is about fifteen fathoms for the first ten fathoms there was only one flucan of four inches width Then it became divided into four parts so much divergent from each other that at the depth of seventyfive fathoms the extreme branches extended twelve feet in width where the flucan reached the lode at this depth there was first discovered a little copper and then a body of pebbles the section of which was about twelve feet square In this part of the lode the schist greatly predominates of course says Mr Came the pebbles are schistose cemented in some parts by chlorite in others by oxide of tin which is generally crystallized and in some of the crevices there is a little copper pyrites The pebbles did not continue in a body to the height of more than two fathoms but scattered bunches were found four fathoms above and six fathoms below the place where they were first discovered At the depth of sixtyfive fathoms and in the lode adjacent to the flucan on each side had been found also a great number of schistose stones but these were angular fragments not rounded nor was there any tin in or about them An Analysis of the Waters of the Dead Sea and the River Jordan By Alexander Marcet MD one of the Physicians to Guys HIospital Communicated by Smithson Tennant Esq FRS Read June 18 1807 Phil Trans 1807 p 296 This analysis is preceded by a short abstract of the notice taken of the Dead Sea by various ancient authors by Strabo by Tacitus 2276 and by Pliny as well as by Pococke Volney and other modern tra vellers who all concur with respect to the intense saltness of the water which is such as to prevent eithier animals or vegetables from living in ita peculiarity from which it has derived its name The only analysis which Dr Marcet has been able to find recorded is that of Macquer Lavoisier and Sage in the Mem de lAcademie for 1778 But these chemists had not attained that accuracy of which modern analysis is susceptible and appear not to have bestowed upon the subject that attention which is requisite in minute analytical ex periments The quantity of the water of the Dead Sea which was the subject of Dr Marcets experiments amounted only to about 1 ounce but it was in a phial carefully corked and appeared to be in a state of perfect preservation The smallness of the quantity and difficulty of obtaining a further supply occasioned Dr Marcet to be anxious that none might be wasted in previous trials He accordingly began by a variety of comparative experiments on artificial solutions in order to ascertain the accuracy of various modes of operating and as he knew by the analysis of Lavoisier and his associates that the principal ingredients which he might expect to find were the mu riates of soda of magnesia and of lime and as the general effect of reagents tended to confirm their results excepting that they indicated the presence of a small quantity of selenite that had been overlooked the solutions on which Dr Marcets experiments were conducted were made to consist of the same ingredients and in proportions which he previously ascertained with great precision The first step which appeared indispensable was to determine the proportions of acid and base in each of the three muriates The composition of muriate of lime was ascertained by pouring a quantity of muriatic acid on a piece of marble of known weight and larger than was necessary to saturate the acid after saturation and evaporation of the solution the residuum was heated to redness and carefully weighed From the weight of this residuum after sub tracting the quantity of lime contained in a given weight of marble which by a number of experiments performed jointly with Mr Ten nant was found to be 561 per cent it appeared that 100 parts of muriate of lime consist of 50 77 lime and 49 23 muriatic acid To discover the proportional parts of muriate of magnesia required a synthetic process somewhat different To a known weight of mag nesia previously calcined was added such a quantity of muriatic acid as would dissolve a known weight of marble and after the whole of the magnesia had been dissolved the excess of acid was saturated with marble by which the redundant quantitywas ascertained Hence the quantity of acid combined with the given weight of magnesia was deduced and the component parts of muriate of magnesia determined to be 4399 magnesia and 56601 acid The proportion of acid and alkali in muriate of soda was found by various methods to be 46 acid and 54 soda The best method appeared to be that of precipitation by nitrate of silver the quan277 tity of acid in luna cornea having been previously determined to be 19 05 per cent by means of the weight of luna cornea produced by a given quantity of acid The method found most successful for analysing the artificial com pound solution consisted in dividing it into two portions from one of which the acid was precipitated by nitrate of silver and its weight ascertained From the other the lime was precipitated by oxalate of ammonia and the magnesia by caustic potash The respective quan tities of acid combined with each being thence deduced by assistance of the preceding experiments the quantity of muriate of soda could be inferred from the remaining quantity of acid By this method a compound solution known to contain 817 muriate of lime eared by trial 814 26 10 muriate of magnesia appeared by train 2562 25 muriate of soda J2547 After this series of preliminary experiments Dr Marcet proceeded to the analysis of the water itself of which 100 parts by evaporation at a temperature of 1800 left a residuum of 41 and at 212 38k When 100 grains of the water were treated by muriate of barytes they gave a precipitate of onetenth of a grain of sulphate of barytes Another portion weighing 250 grains by addition of nitrate of silver yielded a precipitate of 1632 a quantity equivalent to 3109 acid Oxalate of ammonia being then added occasioned a precipitate containing 4814 pure lime and hence the quantity of muriate of lime is computed to be 9 48 The clear solution containing the nitrates of magnesia and of soda with oxalate of ammonia having then been concentrated by evapo ration subcarbonate of ammonia occasioned a precipitate containing 11 1 of pure magnesia which are equivalent to 25 25 muriate of magnesia After deducting the quantities of acid contained in these muriates from the quantity estimated by luna cornea there remained 1228 for acid in the muriate of soda which by estimation from preceding experiments was thus found to be 2669 These results being brought into one view the water of the Dead Sea appears to contain in every 100 parts Muriate of lime  3792 Muriate of magnesia   10100 Muriate of soda  10 676 Sulphate of lime  0054 24632 being the total amount of saline matter when perfectly dry The same chemical reagents as were used to discover the general properties of the water of the Dead Sea being applied to that of the river Jordan were found to produce analogous effects But the quan tity of saline matter was so small that on evaporation of 500 grains at about 2000 the residuum weighed only eight tenths of a grain278 The inference drawn by Dr Marcet from the general resemblance is that the river Jordan might possibly be the source of the saline in gredients of the Dead Sea or that the same source of impregnation might be common to both The Bakerian Lecture on some new Phenomena of chemical Changes produced by Electricity particularly the Decomposition of the fixed Alkalies and the Exhibition of the new substances which constitute their bases and on the general Nature of alkaline Bodies By Humphry Davy Esq Sec RS MRIA Read November 19 1807 Phil Trans 1808 p 1 In this lecture Mr Davy after recalling to our recollection the series of experiments described in his last Bakerian lecture in which various bodies consisting of known ingredients having the highest known affinities for each other were decomposed by the agency of electricity reminds us also of a conjecture which he then formed that a greater intensity of the same power might likewise overcome the affinities of other elements which had not hitherto been sepa rated and proceeds to inform us that this conjecture is now fully verified for that by a laborious experimental application of the powers of electrochemical analysis he has been enabled to decom pose various bodies which have appeared simple when examined by common chemical means Those of his experiments which are in the most mature state re late to the decomposition of the fixed alkalies and to the evolution of new and extraordinary bodies which constitute their bases His first attempts to effect the decomposition of these alkalies were defeated by the presence of water since on that occasion he employed saturated solutions of them in water In his second attempt since solid dry potash is a perfect noncon ductor he kept it in a state of fusion by intense heat during elec trization by a voltaic battery consisting of 100 6inch plates highly charged Under these circumstances the potash became a conductor and brilliant light witli an appearance of flame at the negative wire seemed to prove the development of combustible matter at this point of contact but on account of the heat employed no such product could be collected The method which he next pursued was more successful as he found that a very slight addition of moisture renders potash a con ductor and that in this state it readily fuses by the electric power which at the same time effects its decomposition When a piece of potash weighing as much as forty or fifty grains was exposed under these circumstances to the action of the battery consisting of 100 plates of six inches with 150 of four inches in in tense activity the potash began to fuse at both its points of electri zation There was a violent effervescence at the upper or positive surface by extrication of oxygen gas as afterwards appeared while at the lower or negative surface there was no liberation of elastic

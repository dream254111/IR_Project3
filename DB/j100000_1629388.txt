be either marine or else subterranean streams from the land and it does not seem altogether unlikely that they might be the latter The emergence of subterranean streams might at least account in some cases for the absence of deposits in the valley heads and their nearness to the shore if not for the formation of the valley as a whole The oc currence of an oil well in Vincente valley near its head is significant in this connection The larger prePliocene valleys of the Pacific coast which were much deeper than those of the present time were filled to a greater or less extent during the Pliocene depression of the coast and have been as yet only partially re excavated There are therefore at intervals along the coast deposits of loose materials ex tending to a considerable depth below sea level and through these underground waters under sufficient head might find a submarine outlet It is possible that many if not most of the valleys are due not to any one cause but to several causes whichhave all contributed to their formation or preservation Much care ful and detailed investigation is necessary be fore the problem can be solved and the state ments made here are intended as suggestive rather than final Such work as Professor Ritter reports gives valuable information Observations in the vicinity of the valleys on surface currents their strength direction and persistence and on the temperature and sa linity of the surface waters and also similar observations made as far as possible near the bottoms of the valleys and in their neighbor hood as well as a study of the materials cov ering their floors might throw much light on the question of their origin Further than this detailed geological study of the mainland adjacent to the valleys is necessary The physiographic conditions both subaerial and submarine have been taken into account to a certain extent in this discussion but a fuller knowledge of them is needed Finally as has been stated elsewhere by the writer each val ley must be considered by itself since the ex N S VOL XV No 382 planation for any one is not necessarily the explanation for all W S TANGIER SMITH WASHINGTON D C SHORTER ARTICLES 10W MANY ONEDOLLAR BILLS WILL EQUAL IN WEIGHT A FIVEDOLLAR GOLD PIECE IF the reader will answer the above ques tion in his own mind before going further he will better appreciate what follows This question was asked of a number of students and professors and the answers recorded The answers were surprising and for the most part extravagant It seems that the idea of value is so prominently associated with currency that definite ideas of weight are somewhat wanting although most people have fairly correct ideas of the weight of paper in other forms The number of persons answering the question was 97 The average estimate was 2291 bills the median estimate was 45 In order to see if there is any tendency to confuse the categories of value and weight unconsciously other persons were asked to answer the question How many fivedollar bills will equal in weight a fivedollar gold piece Some were asked a similar question with reference to twentydollar bills Putting the fives and twenties together there were 74 answers given The average estimate was 97 the median 25 The great difference in the averages is due to a half dozen very large answers to the first question but these do not materially affect the median estimates which are the really significant figures The answers are all from males A number of answers were given by female students but their answers either by chance or by nature were of such a great varietyranging from one to one millionthat it seemed best to leave them out in making the comparison After these calculations were made I received answers through the kindness of Professor Templin of the University of Kansas from two divisions of a class of both sexes The figures with reference to the onedollar bills show an average of 2749 and a median esti mate of 99 while with the fivedollar bills theSCIENCE average was 492 and the median 50 It is interesting to note that the ratio of the medi an estimates in the two sets is approximately the same The number of bills actually re quired is a little less than seven J FRANKLIN MESSENGER COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY RECENT PROGRESS IN PETROLOGY CHEMICAL CLASSIFICATION OF ERUPTIVE ROCKS OSANN in a recent paper Tschermaks Min u petrographische Mitth Bd XX pp 399 588 1901 has carried out with reference to the effusive rocks the principles of classifica tion which in an earlier publication Ibid Bd XIX pp 351470 1900 he applied to the plutonic rocks It is his avowed intention to discuss in a third contribution the applica tion of the same principles to the dike rocks The chemical compositions of the rocks are expressed by the general formula sawcJf nz where s the molecule SiO a  the atomic group NaK2Al04 c  the atomic group CaAlO4 f the atomic group FeMnMgSrBaCa O  the proportion of soda molecules when the relative numbers of soda and potash molecules in the rock are calculated to a sum of 10 v  the number of molecules of silica when the ordinary molecular ratios of the rock analysis

two papers 207 analyses of plutonic and 403 analyses of effusive rocks are consid ered and the corresponding rock formulas cal culated From these formulas the rocks are plotted upon triangular projection paper the elements of the projection being a c and f 673 The carrying out of this plan has involved much labor and if the result is somewhat dis appointing it has at least the full value of recording a careful and sustained experiment It is to be regretted that the author has modestly restricted his attempt at classifica tion to setting up types within the groups and families of the Rosenbusch classification It is partly owing to this acceptance of a scheme which has grave objections and which is based on principles little in common with those on trial in this essay that the latter falls short of more conclusive results For example it is seen that the formula of the Klausen type of the diorites is identical with that of a granite intermediate between the Syene type and Kamm type and similar cases are found among the formulas of the basaltic andesitic and allied rocks of the effusives Inspection of the diagrams fails to show any grouping of the effusive rocks upon which classification might be based In the plutonic rocks the anorthosites alone show some tend ency in the graphic projection to form a dis tinct family The silica does not appear in the method of plotting here used and the result is hardly so graphic and satisfactory as that employed by Brogger in his Ganggefolge des Laurdalits GNEISSES OF THE SCHWARZWALD IN continuation of his studies of the crystal line metamorphic rocks of Baden Rosenbusch Mitth der Grossh Badischen Geologischen Landesanstalt IV pp 367395 1901 gives detailed petrographical descriptions and chem ical analyses of the paraaugite and para amphibole gneisses of the Schwarzwald the prefix para signifying their derivation from former sediments The augitic gneisses range from quartzose or psamitic types to those free from quartz It is concluded on chemical grounds supported by geological relationships that these gneisses have been formed by the metamorphism of calcareous sandstones dolo mitic calcareous shales and clayey marls The hornblendic gneisses were derived from a fer ruginous dolomitic marl containing quartz and rutile These interesting studies which recall those APRIL 25 1902

HUNDRED AND NINE NOTES PRIVITY BETWEEN REPRESENTATIVES OF THEE SAME DEdsASED IN DIFFRENT JURISDICTIONSAt common law there is no suggestion that the representa tives of the same deceased in different jurisdictions are so related that a judgment for or against one will bind the other There was no privity even between successive representatives in the same jurisdiction1 until the case of Norgate v Snape2 made the illogical exception of a judgment against an executor by allowing a creditor scire facias against the administrator de bonis tnon The equity courts it is true relaxed the rule to the extent of al lowing the administrator de bonis non to revive suits brought by the execu tor8 and by statutes in England and some of the states an official privity socalled has for certain purposes been established An early Georgia case relying on Norgate v Shape held that a judgment against an execu 1Grout v Chamberlain x8o8 4 Mass 6Ii 21629 Cro Car 167 aFletcher v Wier 1838 7 Dana 345 Woerner

state but at the present the law is generally settled the other way6 In an early decision Aspden v Nixon7 the Supreme Court in deciding that domiciliary and ancillary administrators are not in privity apparently held also that executors in different jurisdictions appointed by the same will though the same person were not in privity This court five years later however in Hill v Tucker stated that executors unlike administrators are in privity but then decided that a judgment against one executor should not be conclusive against the other but merely admissible as evidence to rebut the defenses of prescription or the Statute of Limitation This is in consistent with the real existence of the relation of privity since once the relation is established the judgment should be conclusive Carpenter v Strange gives it this effect but the Supreme Court carefully based its de cision on the fact that the executors in both states were the same person and that therefore the parties to both actions were the same One state court relying on these decisions has unqualifiedly held that there was privity between executors10 The theory of this privity rests on two propositions I That executors unlike administrators who derive their authority from the sovereignty which appoints them get their authority from the will 2 that all executors are responsible to creditors for the testators debts wher ever his effects may be8 Though the first proposition expresses the com mon law rule the requirements of administration statutes at an early period led most of the state courts to repudiate it2 As against the second the better American authority has maintained that an executors liability is limited to the assets received in his own jurisdiction3 It appears there fore that there is now little basis for privity between executors Between administrators in different jurisdictions however for reasons which as indicated above should apply with equal force to executors the courts have held there is no privity of any sort7 As to the administrator and the property confided to him a judgment in another state is res inter alios acta A doubt raised in Brodie v Bickley as to whether this prin ciple would hold where the administrator in both states was the same per son is dissipated by later cases The reasons for the absence of privity are two I there is no legal privity since each administrator derives his authority from the courts of the state of his appointment and he is amenable exclusively to that sovereignty He represents the deceased only to the extent of the assets over which the state courts have jurisdic tion 2 There is no privity of estate since each administrator derives 6Low v Bartlett Mass 1864 8 Allen 259 Brown v Fletcher 1907 210 U S 82 Wilson v Hartford Fire Ins Co

deciding that a judgment against a Montana administrator of the deceased is no bar to a subsequent suit by the Massachusetts administrator is therefore sound on established principles A Wisconsin decisionl reached a contrary result by an application of the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution But it is to be noted that this clause is applicable only when the parties to the second judgment are the same or in privity with the parties to the first which question must first be determined The law of the principal case however has not been established without controversy as is evidenced by the contrary decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals The argument in favor of privity between administrators rests on two classes of decisions the first represented by Biddle v Wilkitns and Talnmage v Chapel21 which hold that an administrator who recovers a judgment in one state may sue on it in his personal capacity in any other state but that the administrator of the state into which he comes has no right to found a suit on the judgment or on the original claim the second represented by Wilkins v Ellett2 which holds that a payment of a debt to one administrator will effect a discharge valid everywhere The answer for the first class of cases is found in Tahnage v Chlapel itself which de cides that one administrator cannot bring suit on the judgment for the ex press reason that he is not in privity with the other Moreover he may not sue on the original claim not because by reason of privity between the two administrators the judgment for one is regarded as a judgment for the other but because recovery of judgment by the first transforms the claim into a debt of record which becomes exclusively a part of his particular assets The theory is that judgment debts are assets for the purpose of jurisdiction where the judgment is recovered7 That a mere unsuccessful prosecution of a suit by an administrator the situation in the principal case will have such an effect the Supreme Court has refused to hold2 The same criticism may be applied to the second class of cases As pointed out in the principal case it does not follow from the fact that an adminis trators lawful acts of administration of the assets within his jurisdiction as receiving payment of a debt are valid everywhere that different admin istrators are in such privity that an unsuccessful prosecution of a suit by one binds another In New York2 on grounds of comity the court has refused to take jurisdiction of a suit by a New York administrator when a similar suit by a Washington administrator was pending in the courts of his state This holding is not in conflict with the cases which deny privity between administrators and seems founded on good reasons of expediency 2sWilson v

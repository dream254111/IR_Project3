Law Reg 529 White v Ry Co 99 Va 357 Ry Co v Land Co 27 Fla 1 Ireland v Ry Co 79 Mich 163 RAILROADSFIRES NEGLIGENCE  COMPLAINT  ISSUES  PROOF  IN sTRUCTIONSWhere in an action against a railroad company for a fire alleged to have been negligently set out the complaint stated that there was a large accumulation of combustible matter on defendants right of way where the fire was set and that for a long time prior to the fire defendant had negligently suffered such matter so to remain during the hot season until it was ignited by sparks from a passing locomotive which fire through defendants negligence escaped and communicated to plain tiffs property such allegation was sufficiently certain and definite both as to the extent of the accumulation of combustible matter etc and also as to the time during which it had been permitted to remain on the right of way Under an allegation that defendant railroad company negligently per mitted fire to escape from its right of way on plaintiffs premises it was not necessary for plaintiff to show that defendant omitted to adopt prudent means to prevent the escape of fire after it had started but it was sufficient under such averment to show the accumulation of com bustible material on the right of way extending up to plaintiffs property so that the communication of fire to plaintiffs property would be the natural and probable consequence of its burning on the right of way Ry Co v Wise Ind 74 N E 1107 See on this point Kimball v Bowen 97 Va 477 Tutwiler v C  0 95 Va 443 By Co v Thomas 92 Va 606 Tyler v Rickamore 87 Va 466 N  W Ry Co v

PREMISES INSPECTIONQUESTION FOR JURYDefendants while reconstructing five elevator bins employed 130 men for that purpose and sought to accom plish the scheme by building inside concrete walls which were to be raised to a height of 108 feet 3 feet thereof being built at a time This work required a scaffolding to be erected in accordance with plans furnished to be put together by the men from material provided by the employer which was to be lifted at intervals by means of tackle pulleys and ropes from above This platform rested upon supports and continued to remain the same structure but for the temporary lifting from time to time Upon this platform a heavy box rested containing concrete and sustained a number of men who stood thereon which tended to increase the strain upon it When the platform had reached through the progress of the work a height of over 70 feet in making a necessary change and lifting the same one of the supports called ledger boards broke from defects therein precipitating a number of the employ6s to the ground who were instantly killed Held under the evidence that the duty of the master in this case should have been necessarily controlled by the hazardous character of the work which could not well be known or appreciated by the ordinary workmen engaged and that the masters duty to furnish a reasonably safe place for his servants to perform their duties could not be avoided by allowing or authorizing any coemploy6s to select the material of which the scaffolding was to be constructed without making him a representative of the master and hence that either by his appointment or by inspection from time to time or some other means to secure a reasonably safe place for the laborers to perform their work the master was required to fulfill his obligation to his servants and whether he did so in this case was a question of fact to be submitted to the jury Carlson v Haglin Minn 104 N W 297 For cases in point see vol 34 Cent Dig Master and

J101009,THE VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER,1098765,THE BICYCLE IN COURT,I245819,VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER REMAINS HAVING BEEN REMOVED LIKE THOSE OF MARSHALL TO RICHMOND WERE INTERRED IN HOLLYWOOD AND NOT IN HOLLYWOOD NOT IN THE ROYAL ACRE OF WESTMINSTER LIES DUST MORE LEARNED MORE KNIGHTLY MORE GENTLE OR MORE GUILTLESS JOHN SELDEN WASHINGTON D C THE BICYCLE IN COURT SO RECENT HAS BEEN THE INTRODUCTION OF THE MODERN BICYCLE THAT IN THE CENTURY DICTIONARY A BICYCLE IS STILL DEFINED AS A TWOWHEELED MA CHINE ONE WHEEL OF WHICH IS OF GREAT SIZE AND PROPELLED BY PEDALS AT TACHED TO THE AXLE OF THE LARGE WHEELA DEFINITION WHICH WOULD HARDLY BE ACCEPTABLE TO A BELIEVER IN THE MODERN SAFETY BUT WHATEVER ITS SHAPE THE BICYCLE HAS PRESENTED TO THE COURTS SOME NEW QUESTIONS WHICH HOWEVER HAVE BEEN SOLVED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY AND WITH A UNANIMITY RATHER UNUSUAL IN THE EARLY DECISIONS ON A NEW AND NOVEL QUESTION WHEN THE BICYCLE WAS FIRST BROUGHT TO THE NOTICE OF THE COURTS THEY WERE INCLINED TO REGARD IT AS A TOY OR SCIENTIFIC PLAYTHING AND NOT OF SUFFICIENT IMPORTANCE TO BE CONSIDERED WHEN ITS USE INTERFERED WITH THE GENERAL PUBLIC CONVENIENCE THUS RESTRICTIONS AS TO ITS USE WERE UPHELD ON THE GROUND THAT A BICYCLE WAS OFTEN A PUBLIC NUISANCE BUT AS THE BICYCLE PASSED INTO THE SPHERE OF GENERAL USE IT COULD NO LONGER BE RE GARDED AS A NUISANCE AND THE FORMER POSITIONS OF THE COURTS WERE ABAN DONED AND THE RIGHTS OF THE BICYCLE RIDER RECOGNIZED AND ENFORCED AND AT THE SAME TIME HIS LIABILITY UNDER STATUTES AND ORDINANCES PASSED BE FORE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE BICYCLE CLEARLY DEFINED THERE HAVE AS YET BEEN BUT FEW DECISIONS IN THE HIGHER COURTS ON THE RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES OF BICYCLISTS BUT SEVERAL IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES HAVE BEEN LAID DOWN IS A BICYCLE A CARRIAGE FTHE COURTS HAVE BEEN FREQUENTLY CONFRONTED WITH THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER A BICYCLE OR TRICYCLE CAN BE CONSIDERED A CARRIAGE SO AS TO COME WITHIN THE STATUTORY PROVISIONS REGARDING THE USE AND MANAGEMENT OF VEHICLES THE OFFICIALS OF THE TREASURY DE PARTMENT AT WASHINGTON HAVE NOT HESITATED TO SUBJECT BICYCLES TO THE 646 JANTHE BICYCLE IN COURT DUTIES IMPOSED ON CARRIAGES AND HAVE HELD THAT BICYCLES CANNOT BE CON SIDERED AS PERSONAL EFFECTS THE EARLIEST CASE IS THAT OF TAYLOR V GOODWIN2 WHERE THE QUESTION AROSE UNDER A STATUTE FORBIDDING FAST DRIVING ON A HIGHWAY THE DE FENDANT HAD BEEN INDICTED FOR RIDING HIS BICYCLE ON THE ROAD IN QUESTION AT A VERY RAPID RATE BUT THE OBJECTION WAS MADE THAT HE DID NOT COME WITHIN THE PROVISIONS OF THE STATUTE IT WAS CONTENDED THAT A BICYCLE IS NOT A CARRIAGE AND CANNOT BE DRIVEN IN THE ORDINARY SENSE OF THE TERM BICYCLES WERE UNKNOWN WHEN THE ACT WAS PASSED AND IT WAS ARGUED THAT THE MERE FACT OF A BICYCLE HAVING WHEELS DID NOT MAKE SUCH A MACHINE A CARRIAGE THE COURT IN AFFIRMING THE JUDGMENT OF CONVICTION SAID I THINK THE WORD CARRIAGE IS LARGE ENOUGH TO IN CLUDE A MACHINE SUCH AS A BICYCLE WHICH CARRIES THE PERSON WHO GETS UPON IT AND I THINK THAT SUCH A PERSON MAY BE SAID TO DRIVE IT HE GUIDES AS WELL AS PROPELS IT AND MAY BE SAID TO DRIVE IT AS AN ENGINEER MAY BE SAID TO DRIVE AN ENGINE THE FURIOUS DRIVING OF A BICYCLE IS CLEARLY WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE STATUTE AND IT SEEMS TO ME WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE WORDS GIVING THEM A REASONABLE CONSTRUCTION BUT THE DOCTRINE HERE LAID DOWN WAS SOMEWHAT MODIFIED IN THE CASE OF WILLIAMSV ELLIS3 A TURNPIKE ACT IMPOSED A TOLL ON CERTAIN KINDS OF CARRIAGESENUMERATING THEMAND ON  EVERY CARRIAGE OF WHATEVER DESCRIPTION AND FOR WHATEVER PURPOSE WHICH SHALL BE DRAWN OR IMPELLED OR SET OR KEPT IN MOTION BY STEAM OR OTHER POWER OR AGENCY THE TOLL WAS HELD ILLEGAL ON THE GROUND THAT THE CARRIAGES HERE REFERRED TO MUST BE CARRIAGES EJUSDEM GENERIS WITH THE CARRIAGES PREVIOUSLY SPECIFIED THE LEARNED JUDGE CONSIDERED THE PURPOSE OF THE TURNPIKE ACT AND DISTINGUISHED IT FROM THE PURPOSE OF THE ACT IN TAYLOR V GOODWIN THUS RECONCILING THE CASES PARKYNS V PREISH DOES NOT BEAR DIRECTLY ON THE QUESTION UNDER DIS CUSSION BUT IT WAS THERE HELD THAT A BICYCLE WITH A SMALL STEAM MOTOR BY WHICH IT COULD BE PROPELLED BUT WHICH DID NOT EMIT ANY STEAM OR SMOKE CAME WITHIN THE PROVISIONS SUBJECTING TO CERTAIN REGULATIONS  EVERY LOCOMOTIVE PROPELLED BY STEAM OR ANY OTHER THAN ANIMAL POWER ON ANY TURNPIKE ROAD OR PUBLIC HIGHWAY IT WAS SO HELD ALTHOUGH THE ACT WAS PASSED BEFORE THE INVENTION OF BICYCLES IN

TO THE RIGHTS OF A CARRIAGE OR WAGON THE WORD VEHICLE  SAID THE JUDGE IS CERTAINLY BROAD ENOUGH TO INCLUDE ANY MACHINE WHICH IS USED AND DRIVEN ON THE TRAV ELLED PART OF THE HIGHWAY FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONVEYANCE UPON THE HIGHWAY  AGAIN IN MERCER V CORBIN DECIDED IN 1888 A BICYCLE WAS HELD TO BE A VEHICLE WITHIN THE SCOPE OF A STATUTE FORBIDDING RIDING OR DRIVING ON SIDEWALKS A LATE CASE IS THAT OF THOMPSON V DODGE2 OCTOBER 1894 WHERE IT WAS HELD IN VERY EMPHATIC LANGUAGE THAT A BICYCLE WAS A VEHICLE AND THE RIDING OR DRIVING OF ONE UPON A PUBLIC HIGHWAY WAS NOT UN LAWFUL AND IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE LEARNED JUDGE THEY CANNOT BE BANISHED BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT ANCIENT VEHICLES AND USED IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN BY ADAM AND EVE IN COMMONWEALTH V FORREST PA3 IT IS HELD THAT UNDER A STATUTE PROVIDING THAT ANY PERSON WHO SHALL WILLFULLY  RIDE OR DRIVE ANY HORSE OR ANY OTHER ANIMAL ON CERTAIN SIDEWALKS TAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH ANOTHER ACT PROVIDING THAT BICYCLISTS SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME RE STRICTIONS AS ARE IMPOSED ON PERSONS USING CARRIAGES DRAWN BY HORSES A PERSON RIDING A BICYCLE ON SUCH SIDEWALKS IS GUILTY OF A VIOLATION OF THE ACT A DRIVER OF A CARRIAGE AND A RIDER OF A BICYCLE HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME RESTRICTIONS AND PENALTIES HOW FAR MAY THE USE OF BICYCLES BE RESTRICTED IT HAS BEEN HELD THAT REASONABLE RESTRICTIONS MAY BE PUT UPON THE INDISCRIMINATE USE OF BICYCLES IN PUBLIC PLACES IN STATE V YOPP4 A STATUTE FORBIDDING ANYONE TO USE UPON THE ROAD OF A PARTICULAR TURNPIKE COMPANY A BICYCLE OR TRICYCLE OR OTHER NONHORSE VEHICLE

USE WAS NOT INJURIOUS TO OTHERS THE COURT HELD HOWEVER THAT HE WAS NOT DEPRIVED OF THE USE OF HIS PROPERTY THAT HE MIGHT HAVE GONE ANOTHER WAY OR AT ANOTHER TIME WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE SUPERIN

IS A NUISANCE WHERE IT MAY BE SITUATE THE CASE WOULD NOW HAVE BUT LITTLE WEIGHT UNLESS A BICYCLE WERE HELD TO BE A NUISANCE WHICH IN THE FACE OF ITS GENERAL USE IS SCARCELY PROBABLE IN TIVILLEY V PERKINS IT WAS ADJUDGED THAT A RULE FORBIDDING PER SONS TO RIDE BICYCLES ACROSS A BRIDGE WAS AUTHORIZED UNDER A STATUTE GIVING COMMISSIONERS POWER TO MAKE RULES AND REGULATIONS FOR THE USE OF SUCH BRIDGE THE RIDER WAS NOT DEPRIVED OF THE USE OF HIS PROPERTY AS HE MIGHT DISMOUNT WHILE CROSSING THE BRIDGE AND SUCH A REGULATION IS NOT UNREASONABLE THE CASE OF MERCER V CORBIN2 WHICH IS A LEADING ONE ON BICYCLE LAW IS AUTHORITY FOR A DICTUM TO THE EFFECT THAT AN ORDINANCE FORBID DING THE USE OF A ROAD BY BICYCLISTS IS VOID AS DEPRIVING CITIZENS OF THE USE OF A PUBLIC HIGHWAY BY A NEW BUT NOW ORDINARY MODE OF TRAV ELLING THIS CASE ALSO DECIDES THAT A DEFENDANT IS LIABLE FOR RIDING HIS BICYCLE ON A SIDEWALK UNDER AN ORDINANCE FORBIDDING RIDING AND DRIVING ON SIDEWALKS THE NEW YORK PARK COMMISSIONERS WHO HAVE AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE FOR THE DIRECTION AND MANAGEMENT OF THE PARKS IN THE CITY HAVE POWER TO PASS AN ORDINANCE THAT NO BICYCLE OR TRICYCLE SHALL BE USED THEREIN AND SUCH AN ORDINANCE HAS BEEN UPHELD IN A BICYCLE CASE THE CASE OF SWIFT V CITY OF TOPEKA4 WAS DECIDED UPON A SIDE ISSUE IN THE INTERPRETATION OF AN ORDINANCE THE LEARNED JUDGE HOWEVER IN HIS OPINION REMARKS THAT IF THE ORDINANCE MEANT TO FORBID THE USE OF A ROADWAYIN DISTINCTION FROM FOOTWAYOVER A BRIDGE BY BICYCLES IT WAS VOID AS DEPRIVING CITIZENS OF THE USE OF A PUBLIC HIGHWAY WHEN THEY WERE FOLLOWING ONE OF THE NEW BUT NOW ORDINARY MODES OF TRAVEL LIABILITY FOR FRIGHTENING HORSESIT MAY BE REGARDED AS A SETTLED PRINCIPLE THAT THE RIDER OF A BICYCLE IS NOT LIABLE FOR INJURY CAUSED BY HORSES BECOMING FRIGHTENED WHILE PASSING HIM UPON THE ROAD IN HOLLAND V BARTCH5 THE LEARNED JUDGE REMARKED THAT THE USE OF A BICYCLE IS NO MORE UNLAWFUL BECAUSE IT TENDS TO FRIGHTEN HORSES THAN THAT OF A LOCOMOTIVE

J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1076602,THE ORGANIZATION OF A LARGE HIGH SCHOOL,I244661,THE SCHOOL REVIEW A JOURNAL OF SECONDARY EDUCATION VOLUME XXII JANUARY 9 14 NUMBER I THE ORGANIZATION OF A LARGE HIGH SCHOOL JOHN A BOLE EASTERN DISTRICT HIGH SCHOOL BROOKLYN NEW YORK NOTEIN THIS NUMBER THE SCHOOL REVIEW BEGINS A SERIES OF ARTICLES ON SEVERAL IMPORTANT SECONDARY SCHOOLS THE PURPOSE OF EACH ARTICLE IS TO SET FORTH THE DEFINITE EXPERIENCE OF A LEADING SCHOOL IN ONE OR MORE ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEMSEDITOR IT IS THE AIM OF THIS PAPER TO DESCRIBE THE PROCESS OF ORGANIZATION WHICH HAS BEEN IN USE FOR SOME TIME AT THE EASTERN DISTRICT HIGH SCHOOL IT HAS TO DO ONLY WITH THE ORGANIZATION OF THE PUPILS OF THE FOUR YEARS GENERAL COURSE ALL OF WHOM ARE IN THE MAIN BUILD ING AT PRESENT 1887 PUPILS ARE ON REGISTER IN THIS COURSE THE COURSE HAS SEVERAL VARIATIONS OFFERS CERTAIN ELECTIVES AND ALLOWS UNRESTRICTED PROMOTION BY SUBJECT IN THE FIRST YEAR PUPILS CHOOSE EITHER LATIN OR GERMAN AS A FOREIGN LANGUAGE IN THE SECOND YEAR THERE IS A CHOICE BETWEEN FRENCH GERMAN AND GREEK AS A SECOND FOREIGN LANGUAGE IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH YEARS THERE ARE VARIOUS ELECTIVES DOMESTIC SCIENCE PHYSICS CHEMISTRY PHYSIOGRAPHY ADVANCED MATHEMATICS AND A THIRD FOREIGN LANGUAGE THE TERMS OFFICIAL CLASS AND SUBJECT CLASS WILL BE USED AN OFFICIAL CLASS IS A GROUP OF PUPILS WHO ASSEMBLE AT THE OPENING AND CLOSE OF SCHOOL IN THEIR OFFICIAL CLASSROOM UNDER THE CHARGE OF THEIR OFFICIAL CLASS TEACHER WHO KEEPS THEIR RECORDS A SUBJECT CLASS IS A GROUP WHICH RECITES ANY SUBJECT TOGETHER THERE IS NO CONNECTION BETWEEN AN OFFICIAL CLASS AND A SUBJECT CLASS THE TERM CLASS MEANS SUBJECT CLASS UNLESS OFFICIAL IS SPECIFICALLY STATED I2 THE SCHOOL REVIEW PROMOTION BY SUBJECT IS THE FEATURE THAT CONTRIBUTES MOST TO THE DIFFICULTY OF ORGANIZATION A GROUP OF FORTY PUPILS TAKING THE SAME SUBJECTS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST YEAR WILL SHOW MANY DIFFERENCES AT THE END OF THE FIRST TERM SOME WILL HAVE PASSED ALL SUBJECTS SEVERAL WILL HAVE FAILED IN SOME ONE OF THE DIFFERENT SUBJECTS OTHERS WILL HAVE FAILED IN TWO THREE OR FOUR SUBJECTS A FEW IN ALL THE DIVERGENCE INCREASES WITH EACH TERM ON ACCOUNT OF FAILURE CHOICE OF DIFFERENT ELECTIVES AND IN SOME CASES THROUGH PUPILS ADVANCING AHEAD OF THEIR GRADE AT THE CLOSE OF THE THIRD YEAR VERY FEW OF THE ORIGINAL FORTY WILL BE DOING THE SAME WORK ONLY ABOUT ONETHIRD OF THE PUPILS IN THE SCHOOL HAVE REGULAR PRO GRAMS WHILE THE PROGRAMS OF SOME PUPILS CONTAIN WORK IN FOUR OR FIVE DIFFERENT GRADES WITH SUCH DIVERSITY OF PROGRAMS THE PROBLEM IS TO MAKE THE CLASSES OF THE SCHOOL UNIFORM IN SIZE AND TO CONTAIN THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF PUPILS CONSISTENT WITH EFFICIENT TEACHING THE WORK OF PROGRAM MAKING MUST BE DONE IN THE BRIEFEST POSSIBLE TIME AFTER THE RECORDS FOR THE TERM HAVE BEEN MADE UP AND BEFORE THE NEW TERM BEGINS TO MAKE THE GENERAL PROGRAM IT IS NECESSARY TO KNOW DEFINITELY HOW MANY PUPILS WILL TAKE EACH GRADE OF EACH SUBJECT FOR THE FOLLOW

WITH THE TERMS WORK THE NUMBER OF CHANGES MADE IN THE TENTATIVE MARKS IS HOWEVER SMALL NOT ENOUGH TO GREATLY AFFECT THE ORGANIZATION BASED ON THE TENTATIVE MARKS FROM THESE MARKS THE OFFICIAL CLASS

TOTAL NUMBER OF PUPILS WHO ARE TO TAKE EACH GRADE OF EACH SUBJECT FROM THIS THE NUMBER OF CLASSES NECESSARY IS DETERMINED THE NEXT STEP IS THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE OFFICIAL CLASSES THE CARDS ARE ARRANGED BY GRADES FOR THE NEXT TERM IF EACH CLASS IS TO CONTAIN 35 PUPILS THE CARDS ARE PLACED IN GROUPS OF 35 LIKE CARDS BEING GROUPED TOGETHER BUT NOT MORE THAN 25 REGULAR CARDS BEING PUT IN THE SAME GROUP THE SECTION OF THE GROUP IS THEN MARKED UPON EACH CARD OF THE GROUP A CARD WHICH BEFORE READ FROM 2B2 TO 3A WILL NOW READ TO 3A3 AFTER EACH NAME ON THE CLASS LISTS IS THEN NOTED THE SECTION IN WHICH THE CARD HAS BEEN PLACED AND TO WHICH THE PUPIL IS TO BE PROMOTED THE OFFICIAL CLASSES ARE THEN ASSIGNED TO OFFICIAL CLASSROOMS AND TEACHERS AND THE LIST OF OFFICIAL CLASS TEACHERS AND ROOMS IS MADE 4THE ORGANIZATION OF A LARGE HIGH SCHOOL THE SUBJECT CLASSES ARE NOW TAKEN UP TWO THINGS ARE ESSENTIAL A SIMPLE NOTATION WHICH DESIGNATES EACH CLASS DISTINCTLY AND REGULARITY IN THE GENERAL PROGRAM TO MAKE THE GENERAL PROGRAM REGULAR EACH CLASS IS PLACED AT THE SAME PERIOD EACH DAY IT RECITES DOUBLE PERIODS ARE ELIMINATED INSTEAD OF A DOUBLE LABORATORY PERIOD FOR PHYSICS A SINGLE PERIOD IS GIVEN WITH TWO TEACHERS IN CHARGE EACH CLASS IS DESIGNATED BY THREE FIGURES EG 306 THE FIRST FIGURE SHOWS THE GRADE OF WORK AND THE THIRD THE PERIOD OF THE DAY AT WHICH IT RECITES THUS 306 IS A THIRD TERM CLASS RECITING THE SIXTH PERIOD A SECOND CLASS IN THE SAME SUBJECT THE SIXTH PERIOD WOULD BE 316 A THIRD CLASS 326 IF THE CLASS RECITES EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK NO DAYS ARE INDICATED IF IT MEETS EXCEPT ON ONE OR TWO DAYS THE CLASS SYMBOL IS FOLLOWED BY X EXCEPT AND THE INITIALS OF THE DAYS ON WHICH IT DOES NOT RECITE AS 306 X WF IF IT MEETS ONLY ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK THE SYMBOL IS FOLLOWED BY A DASH AND THE INITIALS OF THE DAYS ON WHICH IT RECITES AS 306WF IN ARRANGING THE CLASSES OF ANY SUBJECT TWO THINGS MUST BE CON SIDERED THE RELATION OF EACH CLASS TO OTHER CLASSES OF THE SAME GRADE OF THE SUBJECT AND ITS RELATION TO OTHER SUBJECTS WHICH THE PUPIL MAY TAKE THE GENERAL PROGRAM IS MOST SERVICEABLE WHEN THE DIFFERENT CLASSES OF THE SAME GRADE OF A SUBJECT ARE PLACED AT DIFFERENT PERIODS IF THERE ARE SIX CLASSES IN A GRADE THERE WILL BE ONE CLASS AT EACH OF THE SIX PERIODS OF THE DAY CARE MUST OF COURSE BE TAKEN THAT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CLASSES AT ANY PERIOD DOES NOT EXCEED THE NUMBER OF TEACHERS OF THE SUBJECT WHO ARE AVAILABLE IN THE CASE OF SUBJECTS RECITING LESS THAN FIVE TIMES A WEEK CARE IS TAKEN TO AFFORD THE GREATEST NUMBER OF COMBINATIONS WITH OTHER SHORT SUBJECTS ENGLISH AND HISTORY WHICH RECITE THREE OR FOUR TIMES A WEEK MAY BE COMBINED WITH DRAWING OF THE SAME OR ADJOINING GRADES TWICE A WEEK WITH PHYSICAL TRAINING TWICE WITH MUSIC OR ELOCUTION EACH ONCE A WEEK DRAWING PHYSICAL TRAINING AND ELOCUTION OR MUSIC MAY BE COMBINED NEXT THE CLASSES ARE ASSIGNED TO THE TEACHERS OF EACH SUBJECT FOR THIS PURPOSE A SHEET OF PAPER IS RULED WITH SIX HORIZONTAL LINES ONE FOR EACH PERIOD OF THE DAY AND AS MANY VERTICAL COLUMNS AS THERE ARE TEACHERS IN THE DEPARTMENT THE CLASSES CAN THEN BE EASILY ASSIGNED TO THE VARIOUS TEACHERS TWO POINTS ARE KEPT IN 5THE SCHOOL REVIEW MIND THE EQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF WORK AND THE LIMITATION OF THE NUMBER OF GRADES OF WORK ASSIGNED TO EACH TEACHER THE LAST STEP IN MAKING THE GENERAL PROGRAM IS TO ASSIGN THE CLASSES TO ROOMS FOR RECITATION IT MAY HAPPEN THAT THERE ARE SOMETIMES MORE CLASSES TO BE PROVIDED FOR THAN THERE ARE ROOMS IN SUCH CASES SOME CLASSES HAVE TO BE SHIFTED THE ASSIGNMENT OF ROOMS IS MADE BY MEANS OF CARDS ONE SET ARRANGED BY TEACHERS ANOTHER BY ROOMS THE CLASSES EACH TEACHER IS TO TEACH ARE ENTERED ON THE PROGRAM CARD OF THE TEACHER OFFICIAL CLASS TEACHERS TEACH AS A RULE THEIR CLASSES IN THEIR OWN ROOMS BUT THERE ARE SOME TEACHERS WITHOUT OFFICIAL CLASSES AND ROOMS THE SUBJECT CLASSES OF THE OFFICIAL CLASS TEACHERS ARE ENTERED ON THE CARDS FOR THE CORRE SPONDING ROOMS AND THE UNOCCUPIED ROOMS ARE THEN USED FOR THE CLASSES OF TEACHERS WITHOUT CLASSROOMS ANY ROOMS STILL UNOCCUPIED ARE USED FOR STUDY CLASSES TO WHICH TEACHERS WHEN NOT TEACHING ARE ASSIGNED WHEN THIS WORK IS COMPLETED THE ROOM CARDS SHOW THE TEACHER AND CLASS ASSIGNED TO EACH ROOM FOR EACH PERIOD OF THE WEEK AND THE TEACHERS CARDS SHOW THE ROOM AND CLASS ASSIGNED ERRORS ARE ELIMINATED BY CHECKING THE TWO SETS OF CARDS WITH EACH OTHER THE GENERAL PROGRAM IS NOW COMPLETE AND MAY BE MIMEO GRAPHED IT IS ARRANGED BY SUBJECTS AND SHOWS CLASSES TEACHERS AND ROOMS TEACHERS ARE DESIGNATED BY NUMBERS

WHICH IN THE EASTERN DISTRICT IS FURNISHED BY 6THE ORGANIZATION OF A LARGE HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS FROM THE COMMERCIAL DEPARTMENT THE PUPILS PROGRAMS CAN NOW BE BEGUN THIS WORK CAN BE DONE BEST BY THE SMALLEST COMMITTEE THAT CAN ACCOMPLISH THE TASK IN THE TIME AT THEIR DISPOSAL THE EASTERN DISTRICT COMMITTEE CONSISTS OF FIVE TEACHERS AT THE END OF THE EXAMINATION WEEK THE CHAIRMEN OF MARKING COMMITTEES REPORT TO THE PROGRAM COMMITTEE ALL PUPILS WHOSE STANDINGS HAVE BEEN CHANGED BY THE RESULTS OF THE EXAMINATIONS THE OFFICIAL CLASS OF THE PUPIL IS GIVEN ON THESE REPORTS THE CLASS LISTS WITH PROMOTIONS MARKED SHOW IN WHICH OF THE NEW CLASSES THE PUPILS CARD IS THE CARD IS FOUND AND THE CORRECTION MADE THE WORK OF MAKING THE PROGRAMS NOW BEGINS ONE MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE COMMENCES WITH THE PROGRAMS OF THE 4B GRADE ONE WITH 3B ONE WITH 2B ONE WITH IB WHEN THE PROGRAMS OF A CLASS HAVE BEEN MADE THEY ARE GIVEN TO THE FIFTH MEMBER WHO COUNTS AND RECORDS THE NUMBER ASSIGNED TO EACH CLASS A COPY OF THE GENERAL PROGRAM HAS BEEN MADE AND HUNG ON THE WALL WHERE IT CAN BE SEEN BY ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WHEN 25 PUPILS HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED TO A CLASS A DASH  IS MADE ON THIS LARGE PROGRAM AFTER THE CLASS WHEN THE NUMBER HAS REACHED 30 THE DASH IS CHANGED TO A CROSS  WHEN 35 HAVE BEEN PUT IN THE CLASS THE CROSS IS INCLOSED IN A CIRCLE  AND NO MORE PUPILS ARE ASSIGNED TO IT ONE PERSON CAN COUNT AND RECORD THE PROGRAMS AS FAST AS FOUR CAN MAKE THEM IT IS DESIRABLE THAT THE OFFICIAL CLASS TEACHER SHOULD TEACH THE PUPILS OF HIS CLASS THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY FIRST PROVIDING ON THE PUPILS PROGRAMS FOR THE SUBJECT OF THE OFFICIAL CLASS TEACHER IF HE IS A HISTORY TEACHER THE PUPILS ARE FIRST ASSIGNED TO ONE OF HIS HISTORY CLASSES AND THEN THEIR OTHER SUBJECTS ARE ARRANGED FOR THESE PUPILS MAY TAKE THE SAME CLASS IN HISTORY NO MATTER HOW THEY DIFFER IN OTHER SUBJECTS OR THEY MAY BE IN DIFFERENT CLASSES IN HISTORY ALSO BUT IN CLASSES TAUGHT BY THE SAME TEACHER THE NEW IA PUPILS ARE GIVEN STRAIGHT CLASS PROGRAMS WHILE THOSE LEFT BACK IN IA SUBJECTS ARE FOR THE MOST PART ASSIGNED TO ADDITIONAL IA CLASSES WHICH DO NOT APPEAR ON THE REGULAR IA PROGRAMS THE PROGRAMS ARE MADE BY WRITING IN THE BLANK SPACE TO THE RIGHT OF THE PROMOTION CARD ON A LINE WITH THE SUBJECT THE CLASS TO WHICH THE PUPIL IS ASSIGNED IN EACH SUBJECT WHEN THE PROGRAM 78 THE SCHOOL REVIEW IS COMPLETE A GLANCE WILL SHOW WHETHER IT IS CORRECT OR NOT IF THE LAST FIGURE DOES NOT OCCUR MORE THAN ONCE THE PROGRAM IS CORRECT OR IT MAY OCCUR MORE THAN ONCE IF THE SUBJECTS COMBINE ON THE SAME PERIOD IN THE SPECIMEN PROGRAM DRAWING MUSIC AND P T COM BINE RESPECTIVELY WITH HISTORY MATHEMATICS AND ENGLISH SMITH JOHN PROM TED 2 2 O 3A3 FAMILY NAME GIVEN NAME DATE SUBJECT IA LB 2A 2B 3A 3B 4A

THE PROMOTION CARD TO THE PUPILS PROGRAM CARD THIS IS DONE BY EACH OFFICIAL CLASS TEACHER FOR HIS NEW CLASS EACH TEACHER IS PROVIDED WITH A COPY OF THE GENERAL PROGRAM FROM THIS HE TRANSFERS TO THE PRO GRAM CARD THE INFORMATION GIVEN IN REGARD TO THE CLASSES INDICATED ON THE PROMOTION CARD THE FIRST DAY THE SUBJECT OCCURS HE WRITES IN FULL IN THE PROPER SPACE FOR EXAMPLE 402 L4 ROOM 404 THE NEXT TIME THE INITIAL OF THE SUBJECT L IS SUFFICIENT WHEN THE PROGRAM IS COMPLETE ST IS WRITTEN IN ALL BLANK SPACES ON THE CARD THESE CARDS ARE THEN STAMPED BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE PRO GRAM COMMITTEE AND ARE GIVEN TO THE PUPILS THE FIRST MORNING OF THE NEW TERM EVERY PUPIL KNOWS WHERE TO GO FOR EACH PERIOD OF THE WEEK AND IS OBLIGED TO GO THERE FOR EACH TEACHER INSPECTS THE PROGRAMS OF ALL PUPILS REPORTING TO HIS CLASSES AND EXCLUDES FROM THE ROOM ANY WHOSE PROGRAMS DO NOT AUTHORIZE THEM TO BE THERETHE ORGANIZATION OF A LARGE HIGH SCHOOL THE IA PUPILS AND SOME OF THE REGULARS ARE ASSIGNED TO DEFINITE STUDY ROOMS ON THEIR PROGRAMS BUT MOST OF THE PUPILS ARE NOT SO ASSIGNED DURING THE FIRST WEEK OF THE NEW TERM PUPILS HAVING UNASSIGNED STUDY PERIODS REPORT AT THE BEGINNING OF SUCH PERIOD TO THE ASSEMBLY FROM THERE THEY ARE SENT WITH TEACHERS TO THE ROOMS AVAILABLE FOR STUDY PERIODS IF THEY CANNOT ALL FIND SEATS IN THESE STUDY ROOMS THEY ARE ASSIGNED TO ANY UNOCCUPIED SEATS IN ROOMS WHERE RECITATIONS ARE GOING ON SOME ERRORS ARE MADE BY THE OFFICIAL CLASS TEACHERS IN MAKING THE PROMOTION CARDS AND SOME BY THE PROGRAM COMMITTEE IN THEIR WORK SOME PUPILS OBTAIN PERMISSION FROM THE PRINCIPAL TO TAKE WORK OUT OF THE REGULAR ORDER THESE CORRECTIONS AND MODIFICA TIONS ARE STILL TO BE MADE THE OFFICIAL CLASS TEACHER WRITES ON THE BACK OF THE PROMOTION CARD A STATEMENT OF WHAT IS REQUIRED AND GIVES THE CARD TO THE CHAIRMAN OF THE PROGRAM COMMITTEE WHO INDICATES WHAT CHANGE TO MAKE IN THE PROGRAM AND RETURNS THE CARD TO THE TEACHER THIS TEACHER MAKES ON A PROGRAM CARD THE PROGRAM INDI CATED AND SENDS THE PUPIL WITH HIS PROMOTION CARD HIS FIRST PROGRAM AND HIS REVISED PROGRAM TO THE PROGRAM COMMITTEE AT THE CLOSE OF SCHOOL THE NEW PROGRAM IS STAMPED AND THE OLD ONE TAKEN FROM THE PUPIL EACH TEACHER REPORTS THE NUMBER PRESENT AT THE FIRST MEETING OF EACH CLASS IN CHANGING PROGRAMS SENT TO THE COM MITTEE FOR REVISION CARE IS TAKEN TO TAKE THE PUPIL OUT OF LARGE CLASSES AND PUT HIM IN SMALL ONES WHEN THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO IN THIS WAY INEQUALITIES WHICH APPEARED IN THE CLASSES ARE TO SOME EXTENT REMOVED THESE INEQUALITIES ARE FOR THE MOST PART DUE TO THE DROPPINGOUT OF SCHOOL OF PUPILS IN SOME CASES TO ERROR HOW EVER THE ONLY ADJUSTMENT OF CLASSES THAT IS NECESSARY IS THAT MADE IN REVISING THESE PROGRAMS THE METHOD JUST DESCRIBED WAS FOLLOWED IN ORGANIZING THE SCHOOL FOR THE PRESENT TERM THE STATE EXAMINATIONS BEGAN ON JANUARY 15 1912 TENTATIVE MARKS FOR THE TERM WERE GIVEN BY THE SUB JECT TEACHERS TO THE OFFICIAL CLASS TEACHERS ON JANUARY 3 FROM THESE MARKS PROMOTION AND SUMMARY CARDS WERE MADE OUT AND CARDS AND CLASS LISTS WERE GIVEN TO THE PROGRAM COMMITTEE ON JANUARY 5 THE GRAND SUMMARY SHOWING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PUPILS WHO SHOULD

UNEVEN IN SIZE IT IS NOT MORE EXPENSIVE THAN CLASS PROMOTION BUT RATHER MORE ECONOMICAL AS PUPILS DO NOT REPEAT WORK ONCE SATISFACTORILY DONE SECOND IF CLASSES ARE OF UNIFORM SIZE A RELATIVELY LARGE NUMBER OF PUPILS CAN BE TAUGHT WITHOUT OVERCROWDING CLASSES AND WITHOUT OVERWORKING TEACHERS THIRTYFIVE DOES NOT SEEM AN EXCESSIVE MAXIMUM FOR A CLASS IT IS EASIER TO TEACH TWO CLASSES OF 35 EACH THAN ONE CLASS OF 40 AND ONE OF 20 AND TEN MORE PUPILS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED FOR THIRD SUCH AN ORGANIZATION CAN BE EFFECTED IN A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME THE AGGREGATE NUMBER OF HOURS FOR WHICH THE PROGRAM COMMITTEE WAS RELIEVED FROM OTHER WORK WAS O05 II

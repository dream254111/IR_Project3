OF VIRGINIA RICHMOND TEMPLES ADMR V WRIGHT AND ANOTHER March 18 1897 1 APPEALCreditor secured by deed of trust The creditor secured in a deed of trust is the party beneficially interested and may appeal from a decree affect ing his interest although the trustee in the deed fails or refuses to appeal 2 CONSTRUCTION OF WRITTEN INSTRUMENTS Construed as a wholeRepugnant clausesEase at bar In construing a written instrument it is the duty of the court to construe it as a whole taking and considering all the parts together and giving effect to the intention of the parties whenever that is reasonably clear and free from doubt The common law rule that the habendumr clause of a deed must yield to the granting clause in case of repugnance between the two has no application except where the repugnance is such that the in tention of the granter cannot be determined with reasonable certainty from the whole instrument In the case at bar it is reasonably clear from the whole deed that P G Wright took an estate for his life in the land granted with remainder in fee to his son Edward Wright Although the grant was to the two in fee it was immediately coupled with a provision called a con dition that R G Wright was to have the special use benefit and profit for and during his natural life and at his death to his son Edward Wright in fee Appeal from a decree of the Circuit Court of Brunswick county pronounced August 20 1894 in a suit in chancery wherein the ap pellees were the complainants and the appellants and others were the defendants Reversed William H Temple and wife conveyed a tract of land of about 96 acres situate in Brunswick county to R G Wright and Edward Wright to have and to hold the same with general warranty to them and their heirs forever Immediately following these words the deed continues the condition of this deed is that the said land is conveyed to the said R G Wright for his special use benefit and profit for and during his natural life and at his death to his son Ed ward Wright to him and his heirs or assigns forever with all the rights privileges and appurtenances thereto belonging or in anywise appertaining Subsequently Edward Wright conveyed the land which the deed declared was owned by R G Wright his life to a trustee to secure a debt to William H Temple The trustee was about to ad  Reported by M P Blrks State ReporterTEMPLES ADMR V WRIGHT vertise under this deed when the bill in the present suit was filed in which it is claimed that under a fair construction of the deed first above mentioned R G Wright and Edward Wright were joint ten ants in fee of the land and that hence the deed of trust given by Ed ward Wright only operated to convey an undivided half interest in the land and praying that the deed of trust be declared void and of no effect in so far as it purports to create a lien or encumbrance on the other half The Circuit Court took this view of the deed and de creed accordingly From this decree the present appeal was taken R Tlrnbull for the appellant E P Buford for the appellees HARRISON J delivered the opinion of the court The contention that this appeal should be dismissed because the trustee named in the deed of trust did not appeal is without merit The appellant has the beneficial interest and is the party aggrieved by the decree complained of This appeal involves the construction of a deed dated December 14 1881 from William H Temple and wife to R G Wright and Edward Wright which is so far as necessary to be quoted in these words That the said parties of the first part for and in con sideration of the sum of two hundred dollars to them in hand paid the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged does hereby grant and sell to the said parties of the second part the following described land description to have and to hold the same with general warranty to them and their heirs forever The condition of this deed is that the said land is conveyed to R G Wright for his special use benefit and profit for and during his natural life and at his death to his son Ed ward Wright to him and his heirs or assigns forever with all the rights privileges and appurtenances thereto belonging or in anywise appertaining Every deed is supposed to express the intention of the parties and however unusual the form may be it is a primary and cardinal rule of construction that effect must be given to that intent whenever it is reasonably clear and free from doubt and in ascertaining the purpose and object of the parties all parts of the deed must be taken and con sidered together it being a rule of law too well settled to need cita tion of authority that in the construction of any instrument it must be construed as a whole 45 1897VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER In this view it would seem too plain to admit of dispute that the grantor in the deed in question intended to give R G Wright an es tate for life with remainder in fee to his son Edward Wright It is however contended on behalf of the appellees that the deed vests in the grantees joint estates in feesimple and that the portion of the deed which restricts this absolute conveyance of the feesimple is re pumgnant to the granting part of the deed and therefore void It is true that the grant is to both in fee but it is connected immediately without intervening terms with language which shows that by the preceding grant the intention was that one should take only a life estate and the other the remainder in fee The technical common law rule relied on by appellees that the habeindunm clause of a deed yields to the granting clause where there is a repugnance between the estate granted and that limited in tle habenduvm which is a consequence of the rule that deeds are construed most strongly against the grantor is supported by abundant authority It is however not to be invoked as a rule of construction except in those cases where the repugnance is such that the intention of the grantor cannot be determined with reasonable certainty from the whole instrument for where that intention can be ascertained it is controll ing if no legal obstacle lies in the way Bassett v Budlong 77 Mich 338 Fogarty v Stack 86 Tenn 610 Bodmis Admr v Arthur 91 Ky 53 34 Amer St R note p 164 and note to Berridge v Glassey 56 Amer R 324 Chancellor Kent says that the habenduml has degenerated into a mere useless form 4 Kent Com 468 Certainly with us it has prac tically fallen into disuse In the case at bar the language relied on as an habendum cannot strictly be so considered it is so connected with the premises that no judicial exposition severing the two clauses would be warranted The latter clause beginning with the words the condition of this deed c c shows clearly that it was in tended to explain and qualify the preceding grant and thus become a part of it not repugnant thereto but explanatory of the grant It follows from the construction given to the deed under considera tion that the decree complained of must be reversed the injunction granted the appellees dissolved and their bill dismissed Reversed BY THE EDITORWhile no fault can justly be found with the courts con struction of the deed in this case based on the rule that in construing every in strument its intention must be deduced fiom the consideration of the whole and 46 May1897 TEMPLES ADMR V WRIGHT 47 every part yet might not a different construction have been given with the same result If the granting clause be construed as conveying the legal title jointly to the two grantees may not the condition expressed in the next succeeding clause be construed as creating a trust in them for the benefit of one of them R G Wright during his life remainder in fee to the other Edward Wright  Ob serve the language After granting the land to R G Wright and Edward Wright to have and to hold the same with general warranty to them and their heirs forever this language immediately follows The condition of this deed is that the said land is conveyed to R G Wright for his special use benefit and profit for and during his natural life and at his death to his son Edward Wright to him and his heirs or assigns forever c While by the granting clause alone the grantees take a joint estate in fee does not the succeeding clause show an in tention that they shall hold for the use benefit and profit of that is in trust for one of them during his life with remainder in fee to the other It seems to us that this would not be an unreasonable construction and by it full effect would be given to every part of the deed and all question of repugnancy as to the con dition would be avoided Upon either construction however the result would be practically the same

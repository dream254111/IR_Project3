PORCUPINE HARBOUR WHERE WE STAID UNTIL THE 26TH OF SEPTEMBER AND FROM  TO ENGLAND WHICH BEING A COMMON ROUT I SHALL CONCLUDE WITH A FEW GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON WORLD SO LITTLE KNOWN AND SO TERRIBLY REPRESENTED BY PEOPLE WHO IN ORDER TO RAISE THEIR OWN  GERS AND DIFFICULTIES OF COMMON OCCURRENCES MERELY BECAUSE THE PLACES ARE UNKNOWN AND  PROBABILITY OF THEIR EVER BEING CONTRADICTED I DO NOT MEAN THIS AS A PERSONAL REFLEXION BUT  WITH MANY OF THE MASTERS OF GREENLAND VESSELS AS WELL AS THEIR EMPLOYERS AND HEARD SUCH  THOSE COUNTRIES I CANNOT HELP REMARKING IT AS A CIRCUMSTANCE EQUALLY FOOLISH AND RIDICULOUS TEN  A LAUDABLE PRINCIPLE WOULD BE BENEFACTORS TO THEIR COUNTRY BUT ARE DETERRED LABRADORE REMARKS C THE LAND NEAR BALLS RIVER IN SIGHT MAK ING IN  THESE OBSERVATIONS ARE VERY GOOD ONES YET AS THEY GIVE TOO LITTLE AND DIS AGREE WITH THE REST I DID NOT PAY MUCH REGARD TO THEM NOR ALTER THE TRACK AS I CANNOT ANSWER FOR THE WORKING OF THEM A VERY HEAVY GALE OF WIND WHICH OBLIGED US TO THROW OVERBOARD THE GUNS WE HAD ON DECK THIS NIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME THE GALE BEING OVER AND FINE WEATHER SAW THE AURORA BOREALIS WHICH BEGAN IN THE SE QUARTER BUT WAS NEITHER SO STRONG NOR SO BEAUTIFUL AS IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE BY THE OBSERVATIONS ON THE 19TH I  THE ERROR OF THE COMMON RECKONING TO HAVE INCREASED 55 MILES AND BY THESE TO HAVE INCREASED 50 MILES THEREFORE SHALL ALTER THE TRACK TO THE OBSERVATIONS AS I THINK THEM A SUFFICIENT CONFIRMATION OF THE TRUTH HIGH LAND EBS DISTANCE 12 LEAGUES WHICH WAS THE LAST WE SAW MODERATE BREEZES AND NO ICE TO BE SEEN DITTO WITH MISTS

DETERRED  PRESENTATIONS AND I APPEAL TO THOSE SERIES OF FACTS FOR THE TRUTH OF MY ASSERTION THE WEATHER  IS IN THE SPRING AND AUTUMN BOISTEROUS THE SEAS RUN IRREGULAR LIKE THE GULPH OF  PLACES I COULD INSTANCE THAT IS SHORT AND HIGH OCCASIONED I IMAGINE BY THE NARROWNESS OF MANY IMPEDIMENTS IT MEETS WITH FROM THE ICE AND ITS BEING OPEN TO THE SOUTHERN PARTS OF THE AS THE SOUTH WINDS ARE ALWAYS THE STRONGEST BRING THICK WEATHER AND THE GREATEST SEA SO THE  FINE CLEAR WEATHER AND ARE SELDOM STRONG I SHALL HERE FINISH THESE OBSERVATIONS WITH THE PARTIC C AND SHALL COMMUNICATE OBSERVATIONS ON THE

45 OUNCES OF AMBERGRIS WHICH THE SAID CAPTAIN TOOK OUT OF THE BODY OF A FEMALE SPERMACETI WHALE ON THE COAST OF GUINEA MESS CHAMPION AND COFFIN ATTENDING WERE THEN CALLED IN AND THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS WERE PUT TO MR COFFIN VIZ Q HAVE ANY OF THE WHALES TAKEN BEFORE BY SHIPS SAILING FROM GREATBRITAIN TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE CONTAINED ANY AMBERGRIS A NONE THAT EVER I HEARD OF THE AMERICAN SHIPS HAVE AT TIMES FOUND SOME Q WAS THE AMBERGRIS FOUND BY YOU IN A BULL OR COW FISH A IT WAS FOUND IN A COW FISH Q IS IT USUAL TO LOOK FOR AMBERGRIS IN WHALES THAT ARE KILLED A IT HAS NOT HITHERTO BEEN MUCH THE PRACTICE TO DO SO Q HOW HAPPENED IT THAT YOU DISCOVERED THIS A WE SAW IT COME OUT OF THE FUNDAMENT OF THE WHALE AS WE WERE CUTTING THE BLUBBER A PIECE OF IT SWAM UPON THE SURFACE OF THE SEA Q IN WHAT PART OF THE WHALE DID YOU FIND THE REMAINDER A SOME MORE WAS IN THE SAME PASSAGE AND THE REST WAS CONTAINED IN A BAG A LITTLE BELOW THE PASSAGE AND COMMUNI CATING WITH IT Q DID THE WHALE APPEAR TO BE IN HEALTH A NO SHE DID NOT SHE SEEMED SICKLY HAD NO FLESH UPON HER BONES AND WAS VERY OLD AS APPEARS BY THE TEETH TWO OF WHICH I HAVE THOUGH SHE WAS ABOUT THIRTYFIVE FEET LONG SHE DID NOT PRODUCE ABOVE ONE TON AND A HALF OF OIL A FISH OF THE SAME SIZE IN GOOD HEALTH WOULD HAVE PRODUCED TWO TONS AND A HALF Q46 ON THE PRODUCTION OF Q HAVE YOU OBSERVED THE FOOD THAT WHALES GENERALLY FEED UPON A THE SPERMACETI WHALE FEEDS AS I BELIEVE ALMOST WHOLLY UPON A FISH CALLED SQUIDS I HAVE OFTEN SEEN A WHALE WHEN DYING BRING UP A QUANTITY OF SQUID SOMETIMES WHOLE AND SOMETIMES PIECES OF IT THE BILLS OF THE SQUID SOME OF WHICH MR COFFIN PRODUCED WERE FOUND SOME IN THE INSIDE AND SOME ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE AMBERGRIS STICKING TO IT Q DID YOU EVER FIND ANY AMBERGRIS FLOATING ON THE SEA A I NEVER DID BUT OTHERS FREQUENTLY HAVE Q HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN ENGAGED IN THE WHALE FISHERY A IT IS ABOUT SIXTEEN YEARS SINCE I FIRST ENTERED INTO IT Q WHAT IS THE GENERAL PROPORTION OF BULL AND COW WHALES YOU HAVE MET WITH A I BELIEVE THE PROPORTION TO BE NEARLY EQUAL IN MY LAST VOYAGE HOWEVER I FOUND ONLY FOUR BULLS OUT OF THIRTYFIVE WHALES I FISHED UPON THE COAST OF AFRICA BETWEEN FIVE NORTH AND SEVEN SOUTH DEGREES OF LATITUDE I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT THE COW WHALE GOES TO CALVE IN THE LOW LATITUDES WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR MORE COWS BEING FOUND IN THOSE LATITUDES Q IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR SEASON WHEN THE COW WHALES CALVE A I DO NOT KNOW THAT THERE IS Q DOES THE BULL OR COW WHALE IN PROPORTION TO THEIR SIZE PRODUCE MOST OIL A THE COW WHALE WHEN BIG WITH CALF PRODUCES MORE OIL THAN A BULL WHALE OF THE SAME SIZE WHEN SUCKLING SHE PRO DUCES LESS Q ARE THE WHALES USUALLY FOUND SINGLY OR IN PAIRS OR IN LARGER NUMBERS 4 AAMBERGRIS 47 A USUALLY IN LARGE NUMBERS WHICH WE CALL SCOOLS AND PARTICULARLY IN THE LOW LATITUDES I HAVE SEEN FROM FIFTEEN TO PERHAPS A THOUSAND TOGETHER Q HAVE YOU ANY FURTHER INFORMATION ON THIS SUBJECT TO GIVE THE COMMITTEE A WE HAVE GENERALLY OBSERVED THAT THE SPERMACETI WHALE WHEN STRUCK VOIDS HER EXCREMENT IF SHE DOES NOT WE CON JECTURE THAT SHE HAS AMBERGRIS IN HER I THINK AMBERGRIS MOST LIKELY TO BE FOUND IN A SICKLY FISH FOR I CONSIDER IT TO BE THE CAUSE OR THE EFFECT OF SOME DISORDER QUESTIONS PUT TO MR CHAMPION Q AT WHAT PRICE DOES AMBERGRIS USUALLY SELL AND AT WHAT PRICE DID THAT TAKEN BY YOUR SHIP SELL A A SMALL QUANTITY HAD LATELY SOLD AT 25S PER OUNCE BUT IT WAS THEN VERY SCARCE MINE SOLD FOR 19S 9D PER OUNCE THE WHOLE QUANTITY FOUND IN THIS WHALE WAS 362 OUNCES TROY THE PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT IT TOLD ME THIS WAS A LARGER QUANTITY THAN WAS EVER BEFORE BROUGHT AT ONCE TO MARKET IT HAS BEEN GENERALLY SOLD AT ABOUT 4 OR 5 POUNDS AT A TIME Q FOR THE USE OF WHAT COUNTRY WAS THIS AMBERGRIS BOUGHT A I DO NOT EXACTLY KNOW IT WAS BOUGHT BY A BROKER WHO TOLD ME THAT HIS PRINCIPAL WHO PURCHASED ABOUT ONE HALF BOUGHT IT FOR EXPORTATION TO TURKEY GERMANY AND FRANCE THE OTHER HALF WAS PURCHASED BY THE DRUGGISTS IN TOWN

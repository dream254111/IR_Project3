on the eclipfes of Jupiters fatellites within afingle fecond This fad is a firong proof in favour of the accuracy of this method of determining the longitude of places R PNote to face page 451 All the obfervations for the longitude of Natchez after the 23d of March are entered as obferved by the clock and will therefore require a correaion to reduce them to mean folar time which may readily be done from the following ifatement of the errors of the clock with its rate of going at different periods during tlle courfe of the obfervations 1797 1  June I2th Clock too faft mean time 3 55 29 dail lof

that the Longitude deduced from the eclipfes of Jupiters fatellites exceeds that deduced from the lunar obfervations in cluding the eclipfe of the Moon on the 3d of December laft by 2 47But I am of the opinion that the moft dependence is to be placed upon the eclipfes of Jupiters fatellites which together with the Lunar eclipfe may be further corrected if any correfponding obfervations fhould happen to have been made in any place where the Longitude has been accurately fettled The follow ing ftatement in which the Longitude deduced from the eclipfes of tlle fatel lites is given double the we3ght of that deduced from the Lunar obfervations will certainly give the Longitude of the town of Natchez with great accuracy i60 13 55 i6 i6 42 i6 i6 42 Mean i6 I5 46 Longitude Wecf from

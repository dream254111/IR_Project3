THE OPINION THAT THE MOFT DEPENDENCE IS TO BE PLACED UPON THE ECLIPFES OF JUPITERS FATELLITES WHICH TOGETHER WITH THE LUNAR ECLIPFE MAY BE FURTHER CORRECTED IF ANY CORREFPONDING OBFERVATIONS FHOULD HAPPEN TO HAVE BEEN MADE IN ANY PLACE WHERE THE LONGITUDE HAS BEEN ACCURATELY FETTLED THE FOLLOW ING FTATEMENT IN WHICH THE LONGITUDE DEDUCED FROM THE ECLIPFES OF TLLE FATEL LITES IS GIVEN DOUBLE THE

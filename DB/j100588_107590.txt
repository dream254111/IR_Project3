J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107590,THE DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERS BETWEEN THE OVA OF THE SEPIA AND THOSE OF THE VERMES TESTACEA THAT LIVE IN WATER EXPLAINED,I206972,XXIII TIHE DISTIZNGUISHING CHARACTERS BETWEEN THE OVA OF THE SEPIA AND THOSE OF THE VERMES TESTACEA THAT LIVE IN WATER EXPLAZNED BY SIR EVERARD HOME BART 7 P RS S READ JUNE S 1817 L NNMUS WAS LED INTO AN ERROR RESPECTING THE ANIMAL THAT FORMS THE SHELL ARGONAUTA BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF A SPECIES OF SEPIA HAVING BEEN OFTEN FOUND IN THIS SHELL THIS ERRONEOUS OPINION HAS BEEN ADOPTED BY MANY NATURALISTS UPON THE CON TINENT EVEN THOSE CONVERSANT IN COMPARATIVE ANATOMY WHETHER THE ARGONAUTA IS REALLY AN INTERNAL SHELL WHICH I HAVE ASSERTED IT TO BE MAY POSSIBLY NEVER BE DETERMINED BY DIRECT PROOFS AS THE ANIMAL BELONGING TO IT HAS NOT BEEN MET WITH THE PRESENT OBSERVATIONS ARE CONFINED TO THE QUESTION OF THE PROBABILITY OF ITS BEING FORMED BY THE SPECIES OF SEPIA FREQUENTLY FOUND IN IT  AND THE MATERIALS OF THE PRESENT PAPER WHICH ARE FURNISHED FROM THE SPECIMENS OF NATURAL HISTORY COLLECTED IN THE LATE EXPEDITION TO THE CONGO ENABLE N TO PROVE IN CONTRADICTION TO SUCH AN OPINION THAT THE OVA OF THIS PARTICULAR SPECIES OF SEPIA ARE NOT THOSE OF AN ANIMAL OF THE ORDER VERMES TESTACEA THAT LIVE IN WATER THE YOUNG OF ALL OVIPAROUS ANIMALS WHUE CONTAINED IN TIE OVUM MUST HAVE THEIR BLOOD AERATED THROUGH ITS COATS BUT IN THE VERNES TESTACEAI IF THE SHELL WERE FORMED IN THE OVUM THE PROCESS OF AERATING THE BLOOD MUST BE VERY IMATERIALLY INTERFERED VITH FOR THIS REASON THE COVERING OR SHELL OF THE EGG FIRST DROPS OFF AND THE YOUNG IS HATCHED BEFORE THE SHELL OF THE ANIMAL IS FORMED THIS I HAVE SEEN TAKE PLACE IN THE EGGS298 SIR EVERARD HOME ON THE OF THE GARDEN SNAIL BUT IN THE TESTACEA THAT LIVE IN WATER THE YOUNG REQUIRES SOME DEFENCE IN THE PERIOD BETWEEN THE EGG BEING HATCHED AND THE YOUNG ACQUIRING ITS SHELL WHICH IS NOT NECESSARY IN THOSE THAT LIVE ON LAND FOR THIS PURPOSE THE OVA ARE ENCLOSED IN CHAMBERS OF A PARTICULAR KIND THIS CAMERATED NIDUS IN THE LARGER ANIMALS OF THIS TRIBE MUST BE FAMILIAR TO ALL NATURALISTS SINCE SPECIMENS IN A DRIED STATE CONTAINING THE YOUNG SHELLS COMPLETELY FORMED ARE TO BE MET WITH IN COLLECTIONS OF NATURAL HISTORY  BUT I AMN NOT AWARE THAT ALL THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH SUCH A NIDUS IS SUPPLIED BY NATURE HAVE EVER BEEN EXPLAINED I HAVE BEEN INFORMED BY A FRIEND WHO WHILE IN THE EAST INDIES SAW THE CHANK  A SHELL BELONGING TO THE SAME GENUS WITH THE VOLUTA PYRUM OF LINNWUS SHED ITS EGGS THAT THE ANI MAL DISCHARGED A MASS OF MUCUS ADAPTED TO THE FORM OF THE LIP OF THE SHELL ANAD SEVERAL INCHES IN LENGTH  THIS ROPE OF EGGS ENCLOSED IN MUCUS AT THE END WHICH IS LAST DIS ENGAGED WAS OF SO ADHESIVE A NATURE THAT IT BECAME ATTACHED TO THE ROCK OR STONE ON WHICH THE ANIMAL DEPOSITED IT AS SOON AS THE MUCUS CAME IN CONTACT WITH THE SALT WATER IT COAGULATED INTO A FIRM MEMBRANOUS STRUCTURE SO THAT THE EGGS BECAME ENCLOSED IN MEMBRANOUS CHAMBERS AND THE NIDUS HAVING ONE END FIXED AND THE OTHER LOOSE WAS MOVED BY THE WAVES AND THE YOUNG IN THE EGGS HAD THEIR BLOOD AERATED WHEN THE YOUNG WERE HATCHED THEY REMAINED DE FENDED FROM THE VIOLENCE OF THE WAVES TILL THEIR SHELLS HAD ACQUIRED STRENGTH WHAT PASSES UNDER THE SEA FEW NATURALISTS CAN BE SO FORTUNATE AS TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF OBSERVING AND AL THOUGH WHAT I HAVE STATED WAS COMMUNICATED TO ME BY AN EYE WITNESS IT REQUIRED CONFIRMATION AS WELL AS AN OPPORTUNITYOVA OF THE SEPIA AND THOSE OF THE VERMES TESTACEA 999 OF EXAMINING THE NIDUS BEFORE I COULD GIVE IT MY ASSENT SINCE THAT TIME I HAVE PROCURED FROM MY FRIEND MR LEE THE BOTANIST OF HAMMERSMITH A PORTION OF A CAMERATED NIDUS BROUGHT FROM SOUTH CAROLINA CONTAINING SHELLS OF AN UNIVALVE NOT VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE CHANKS OF THE EAST INDIES THIS NIDUS IS REPRESENTED IN THE ANNEXED DRAWING PI XIII FIG 7 I HAVE ALSO WHICH IS STILL MORE SATISFACTORY SEEN THE CAME RATED NIDUS OF THE HELIX JANTHINA THIS ANIMAL NOT LIVING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA LIKE THE VERMES TESTACEA IN GENERAL DEPOSITS ITS OVA UPON ITS OWN SHELL IF NOTHING ELSE COMES IN ITS WAY ONE OF THE SPECIMENS OF THE SHELL OF THE JANTHINA CAUGHT IN THE VOYAGE TO THE CONGO FORTUNATELY HAS THE OVA SO DEPOSITED AS WILL BE SEEN IN THE ANNEXED DRAWINGS MADE BY MR BAUER WHO WAS SO PLEASED WITH THE APPEARANCE THE PARTS PUT ON IN THE FIELD OF THE MICROSCOPE THAT HE WAS DESI ROUS OF MAKING A REPRESENTATION OF THEM P1 XIII FIG 12 845 6 IN THIS INSTANCE THE OVA ARE SINGLE BUT IN OTHER TRIBES SEVERAL OVA ARE CONTAINED IN ONE CHAMBER IN THE LAND SNAIL THE EGGS HAVE NO SUCH NIDUS THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS RESPECTING THEM WERE MADE IN THE YEAR 1773 THE FIRST YEAR THAT I WAS INITIATED IN COMPARATIVE ANATOMY UNDER MR HUN TER HE KEPT SNAILS TO ASCERTAIN THEIR MODE OF BREEDING AND THE NOTES THAT WERE MADE AT THE TIME IN MY OWN HAND WRITING I NOW COPY AUGUST 5 1773 A SNAIL LAID ITS EGGS AND COVERED THEM OVER WITH EARTH MR HUNTER TOOK ONE OUT AND EXAMINED IT THE EGG WAS ROUND ITS COVERING STRONG AND OF A WHITE COLOUR WITH A DEGREE OF TRANSPARENCY IT HAD NO YELK A SMALL SPECK WAS OBSERVABLE WITH A MAGNIFYING GLASS IN THE TRANS PARENT CONTENTS0OO SIR EVERARD HOME ON THE ON THE 9TH NO APPARENT CHANGE HAD TAKEN PLACE ON THE LITH THE SPECK HAD ENLARGED BUT WAS TOO TRANSPARENT TO ADMIT OF ITS FORM BEING DISTINGUISHED UPON MOVING THE SPECK IT FELL OUT OF ITS PLACE ON THE 12TH THE EMBRYO WAS INDISTINCTLY SEEN ON THE 1F5TH THE EMBRYO FILLED 4 PART OF THE EGG BUT THE DIFFERENT PARTS WERE STILL INDISTINCT ON THE I8TH THE BODY OF THE EMBRYO HAD BECOME LARGER AND THE COVERING THICKER ON THE I9TH THE COVERINGS OR SHELLS OF ALL THE EGGS WERE MORE OR LESS DISSOLVED SO MUCH SO THAT MR HUNTER THOUGHT ALL THE EGGS WERE ROTTING AND THE WHOLE BROOD OF YOUNG WOULD BE LOST ON THE 2OTH THE YOUNG WERE HATCHED AND THE SHELLS COM PLETELY FORMED ON THE ESD WHEN THE YOUNG SNAILS WERE PUT IN WATER THEIR BODIES CAME OUT OF THE SHELL AS IN FULL GROWN SNAILS ON THE 24TH THEY ALL DESERTED THEIR NESTS THE SPECIMENS OF THE SEPIA FOUND IN THE ARGONAUT SHELL WHICH WAS CAUGHT BY MR CRANCH IN THIS EXPEDITION TO THE CONGO HAD DEPOSITED SOME OF ITS EGGS IN THE INVOLUTED PART OF THE SHELL AND THE ANIMAL BEING FORTUNATELY CAUGHT IN THE SHELL IDENTIFIED THE EGGS TO BELONG TO IT PI XIV THEY ARE UNITED TOGETHER BY PEDICLES LIKE THE EGGS OF THE SEPIA OCTOPUS AND IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS RESEMBLE THEM THEY DIFFER FROM THOSE OF THE HELIX JANTHINA AND THE OTHER VERMTES TESTACEA THAT LIVE IN WATER IN HAVING NO CAMERATED NIDUS AND IN HAVING A VERY LARGE YELK TO SUPPLY THE YOUNG WITH NOURISHMENT AFTER THEY ARE HATCHED UPON THESE GROUNDS THIS ANIMAL MUST BE RESOLVED INTO A SPECIES OF SEPIA AN ANIMAL WHICH HAS NO EXTERNAL

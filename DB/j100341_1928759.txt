In later numbers the second and third problems will be considered Looking to the past the specific questions to be answered are What series constituted good indices of business conditions and what ones did not  In answering the question just stated how may we set up a standard for judgment  Have fluctuations in certain series systematically anticipated the fluctuations in others or did they all occur simultaneously  If the fluctuations of certain series anticipated or lagged behind those of other series what was thle degree of anticipation or of lag  Looking to the present and future the specific ques tions encountered are Do the series which served satisfactorily for a past period serve as well today  How have the various series been affected by the transition from peace to war  What change will probably take place in the tran sition from war to peace  If old series have lost their significance as indices of business conditions may other series be substituted for them  Is it possible to apply the lessons of the past to new data  These questions which involve the further develop ment of statistical method application of method crit ical analysis of data and interpretation of results are reserved for consideration in the next number of the REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STATISTICS 11 APPLICATION OF THE METHOD TO INDIVIDUAL SERIES I OUTLINE OF THE METHOD a The data necessary for the application of the method are homogeneous monthly series of statistics covering a period of say fifteen years or more b The linear secular trend is found by fitting a straight line to annual items by the method of least squares The compound interest curve parabola or other curves are used in case a straight line does not give satisfactory results c Indices of seasonal variation are found by taking the medians of monthtomonth percentages for each of the twelve months The medians thus found are progressively multiplied to form a continuous series the discrepancy due to secular trend is distributed and the average is made equal to ioo d The original items are corrected for secular trend and seasonal variation as follows each monthly ordi nate of secular trend is multiplied by the index of sea sonal variation for that month the resulting product is subtracted from the corresponding original item and then expressed as a percentage of the ordinate of secular trend e The percentage deviations of the various series are expressed in terms of their respective standard deviations in order to secure comparable cyclical fluctuations 2 AccuRACY IN DATA AND COMPUTATION The items of the statistical series studied have been taken to three or four significant figures only There are several reasons for doing this First the items of the series are probably not reliable beyond the fourth digit second even if the items were accurate to more digits a change in such digits would rarely be significant third the use of additional digits would enormously increase the labor of handling the data and fourth the limited extent of monthly data does not in general warrant us in measuring seasonal and other variations more closely than to the nearest per cent Since the margin of error of our corrected figures depends upon the accuracy of the measurements of secular trend and seasonal variation as well as upon the accuracy of the original figures it is clear that the least accurate of these figures sets the limit of desirable re finement in computation In general then the com putations were carried to the nearest per cent only This degree of accuracy was used in computing month tomonth link relatives except for Bradstreets prices and for interest rates for which series the computa tion was carried to tenths of a per cent Especial care was taken to keep out cumulative errors resulting from approximations In computing percentages a ten or twentyinch slide rule was used Every computation was checked the plan followed was to have two computations made by independent computers the results compared discrep ancies noted and the items in disagreement recom puted independently and recompared The probable error of the final figures depends upon the error of the original figures the extent of the data and upon the probable errors of the determination of secular trend and seasonal variation The errors of the original fig ures are dependent upon the accuracy of collection of the data and upon the nature and extent of the sample if the items are samples The probable error of the de termination of the secular trend cannot be stated defi nitely The only test we have is the accuracy of the fit of the line to the data covering a period of sufficient length The probable error of the indices of seasonal variation depends upon the closeness of grouping of the relatives To illustrate we may compute  indices of seasonal variation  for the number of shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange But even granting seasonal variation it is not possible to measure the fluctuations closer than to io per cent In the case of outside bank clearings however the measurement is probably accurate to I per cent In the case of yield on railroad bonds the seasonal variation must be measured to tenths of a per cent if measured at all The use of the median to measure the seasonal varia tion reveals clearly the fact that the resulting measure ment is an approximation that in exceptional cases might be changed several per cent by the inclusion of a

THE R SOCIETY DAT ED FROM DELF JANUARY 5TH 1685 CONCERNING THE SALTS OF WINE AND VINEGAR CD THOUGH I HAVE OFTEN EXCUSED MY SELF FROM EXAMIN ING THE VARIOUS FIGURES OF SALTS PARTLY SUPPOSING IT WOULD BE TOO MUCH LABOUR TO ME AND MORE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IN SOME ATTEMPTS OF THAT NATURE I FORMERLY HAD NO SUCCESS THE WARMNESS OR COLDNESS OF THE AIR CAUS ING GREAT DIFFERENCES IN THE SHAPES OF THE SALTS NEVER THELESS BY LIGHTING ON A NEW METHOD I HAVE BEEN EN COURAGED TO MAKE THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS HAVING FOUND MY YEARLY PROVISION OF VINEGAR WHICH HAD LAYN ABOUT 3 MONTHS IN MY CELLAR TO BE MORE SOUR THEN ORDINARY I LEFT IT OPEN TO THE AIR DURING SOME HOURS AT WHICH TIME I OBSERVD A VERY GREAT MANY PARTI CLES WHICH I CALL THE SALT OF THE VINEGAR AS NUMB 1 FIG A TAPERING TOWARDS EACH END AND HAVING IN THE MID DLE A LONG BROWNISH FIGURE OTHER OF THE SAME EXTENT AS FIG B BEING AS CLEAR AS CHRYSTAL AND THESE WERE THE MOST NUMEROUS OTHERS BEING LONG AND BROWNISH WHICH HAD IN THE MIDDLE OF THEM A BRIGHT CLEAR SUBSTANCE AS FIG C IN ANOTHER PLACE WERE SOME FEW OVAL FIGURES WITHIN WHICH WERE CONTAINED SOME LESSER OVALS AS FIG D UNDER THE AFORESAID FIGURES A B C I THOUGHT I SAW MANY THAT HAD A HOLLOWNESS WITHIN THEM LIKE THAT OF A BOAT SOMETIMES ONE OF THE AFORESAID FIGURES HAS APPEARED TO ME WITH THE ONE HALF BROWN AND THE OTHER PART CLEAR SOMETIMES ONE OF THE FIGURES HATH LAYN A THWART ANOTHER AS AT E SOMETIMES THERE WERE FIGURES WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN CUT IN TWO EACH OF THEM RE PRESENTING BUT ONE HALF OF A B OR C AS F MANY OF THESE AFORESAID FIGURES WERE SO SMALL AS SCARCE TO BE SEEN BUT V 3 WITHALL964 WITHALL THEY WERE SO NUMEROUS THAT I JUDGD THEM TO BE MANY THOUSANDS IN ONE SMALL DROP OF VINEGAR BESIDES AN INNUMERABLE QUANTITY OF SMALL GLOBULES SIX WHEREOF WOULD NOT EQUALL A BLOOD GLOBULE AND A MUCH GREATER NUMBER OF LESSER GLOBULES 36 WHEREOF WOULD NOT RISE TO THE BIGNESS OF A BLOOD GLOBULE IN A WORD IT SEEMED IN COMPREHENSIBLE THAT THERE SHOULD BE SO MANY PARTICLES CONTAINED IN SO SMALL A QUANTITY OF MOISTURE AND THAT TRANSPARENT TOO THESE AFORESAID PARTICLES I TAKE TO BE THE SHARP PUNGENT MATTER WHICH CAUSES THE SENSE IN THE TONGUE THAT WE TERM SOUR ALTHO BY A COMMON MAGNIFYING GLASS I HAVE SEEN THE FIGURES OF THIS BIGNESS YET I SUPPOSE THESE MAY BE MADE OUT OF A GREAT MANY LESSER ONES WHICH MAY HAVE THE SAME FIGURE JUST AS IN SEAWATER MANY MILLIONS OF CUBICAL FIGURES GO TO THE MAKING UP ONE LARGE CORNS OF SALT OF THE SAME SHAPE I PUT INTO A GLASS ABOUT TWO INCHES WIDE A LITTLE VINE GARWHICH I LET STAND UPON MY TABLE FOR 8 WEEKS IN THIS TIME I FOUND SWIMMING UPON THE SURFACE OF THE VINE GAR MANY PARTICLES WITHIN WHICH I PERFECTLY DISCERNED A HOLLOWNESS LIKE TO THAT OF THE INSIDE OF A BOAT FOR THE FIGURES WERE NOW INCREASED IN THICKNESS THOSE THAT HAD THE CAVITY TURNED TO THE EY WERE AS FIG G THOSE WHOSE SIDES WERE TURNED TO THE EY WHICH HAD ONLY PART OF THE CAVITY TO BE SEEN WERE AS FIG H I HAVE ALSO DESCRIBED A FULL GROWN LIVE EEL AS FIG LM SUCH A ONE WHEREOF THERE WERE MANY MORE IN THE VINEGAR AS ALSO A FULL GROWN EEL WHICH I KILLED THAT THE DESIGNER MIGHT SEE IT MORE DISTINCTLY AS FIG N O THIS ALSO MAY SERVE TO SHEW THE BIGNESS OF THE SALT PAR TICLES COMPARED WITH THAT OF THE EELS IT IS ALSO TO BE NOTED THAT THE FOREGOING FIGURES AND EELS ARE DRAWN BY A COMMON MICROSCOPE AND THAT THERE WERE MANY OTHER SMALLER SALT PARTICLES TO HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED BY MY BETTER GLASSES ALSO965 ALSO I CANNOT BUT TAKE NOTICE HOW SOME MEN ARE DECEIVED THAT THINK THE SOURNESS OF VINEGAR PROCEEDS FROM EELS PRICKING THEIR TONGUES WITH THEIR TAILS FOR IF THIS WERE TRUE THEN WOULD SOME VINEGAR BE FLAT BECAUSE THERE ARE NO EELS IN IT OR THAT THE EELS ARE DEAD IN IT AS IS USUALL IN COLD OR FROSTY WEATHER I CONSIDERED SOME VINEGAR THAT HAD CRABSEYS PUT IN IT BECAUSE THEY ARE SAID TO TAKE AWAY ITS SOURNESS IF THIS BE TRUE I CONCLUDED THAT THE ABOVE DESCRIBED SALT PARTICLES MUST BE CHANGED EITHER BY INCREASING THE BULK OR BECOMING MORE PLYABLE AND LIMBERSO AS NOT TO PIERCE THE TONGUE I TOOK SEVERALL NEW GLASSES AND PUT IN THEM SOME CRABSEYS SPLIT INTO SMALL PIECES LEAST THE GRIT THAT COMES FROM THEM AFTER THEY ARE POUNDED SHOULD HINDER MY SIGHT I FOUND THAT THE LONG SHARP FIGURES WHICH MIGHT BE LIKNED TO A WEAVERS SHUTTLEWERE NOW CHANGED INTO FIGURES WHOSE BASIS WAS OBLONG RISING UP PYRAMI DALLY LIKE A POINTED DIAMOND AS NUM 2 FIG P OTHERS HAD THEIR BASIS SQUARE AS FIG  OTHERS AN IRREGULAR QUADRILATERAL AS FIG R BUT THESE TWO LAST FIGURES I SUPPOSED WERE ACCIDENTAL FOR WANT OF SUFFICIENT MATTER TO COMPLEAT AND PERFECT THEM ON ALL SIDES NOTE THAT THE GREATNESS OF THESE SALT PARTICLES AND THOSE IN SIMPLE VINEGAR MUST NOT BE COMPARED TOGETHER BECAUSE THESE ARE DRAWN BY A GLASS THAT MAGNIFIED MORE THEN THAT WHERE WITH THE OTHERS WERE DRAWN FOR OTHERWISE THESE WOULD NOT SO CLEARLY HAVE BEEN DISCERNED THE NUMBER OF PARTICLES WAS SO GREAT THAT IN A GROSS COMPUTATION I JUDGED THEM TO BE SIX THOUSAND IN A DROP ABOUT THE BIGNESS OF TWO BARLYCORNS BUT THAT WHICH I MOST WONDRED AT WAS THAT THESE SALT PARTICLES HERE WERE ALMOST ALL OF THE SAME BIGNESS A THING I NE VER OBSERVED IN ANY OTHER SALT BEFORE I TOOK SOME VINEGAR OUT OF A GLASS THAT HAD CRABS EYS IN IT AT A TIME BEFORE ALL THE AIRBUBBLES WERE AS CENDED966 CENDED BUT EVEN THEN THE BASIS OF THE SALT PARTICLES WAS FOURSQUARE AND NOT AS IN COMMON VINEGAR WHEN THE AIRBUBBLES WERE MOST OF THEM ASCENDED I DRANK ABOUT A THIRD PART OF A THIMBLE FULL OF THE VINEGAR AND FOUND IT HAD NO SOURNESS AT ALL IN IT BUT RATHER A BITTERNESS AND WAS SO LOATHSOME THAT IT MADE ME READY TO VOMIT I TOOK ALSO WHITE CHALK BEATEN TO PIECES AND PUT IT IN VINEGAR WHERE IT CAUSED AS GREAT A COMMOTION AND RISING OF AIRBUBBLES AS THE CRABSEYS HAD DONE IT PRODUCED ALSO THE SAME FIGURES OF THE SALT AND THE SAME INSIPIDNESS FROM THESE OBSERVATIONS I AM CONFIRMED IN AN OPI NION WHICH I HAVE BEEN OF A GREAT WHILE THAT WHEN THE SHARP SUBTILE PARTICLES OF SALT WHICH ARE IN SEVERALL LI QUORS COME TO BE IN THE STOMACK THEY ARE THERE SO COAGULATED AND COMPOUNDED THAT VERY FEW OR NONE OF THEM ARE COMMUNICATED TO THE BLOOD OR OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY FOR IF THE SALTS OF WINEAND VINEGAR DID NOT CHANGE THEIR FIGURE IN THE STOMACK I BELIEVE THEY WOULD CAUSE IN THE BLOOD AND OTHER VESSELS AN INTOLERABLE PRICKING IF NOT END ANGER THE LIFE OF THE PARTY BESIDES IF IT WERE NOT SO I SHOULD HAVE MET WITH THEMSOME TIME OR OTHER EITHER IN THE SWEAT BLOOD OR URINE ALSO THE SALT PARTICLES WHICH ARE IN WINE OR VINEGAR WHEN THE WEATHER IS MOIST ARE CURDLED OR GO TOGETHER BUT AFTERWARDS LET THE WEATHER BE WHAT IT WILL I HAVE NEVER FOUND THEM DISSOLVED OR TURNED INTO WATER AND THUS THEY ARE MORE DURABLE THEN COMMON SALT WHICH IN MOIST AND COLD WEATHER RUNS INTO A LIQUID FORM A GAIN IF THE SALTS IN THE WINE OR VINEGAR WERE NOT COA GULATED IN THE STOMACK THE URINE OR EXCREMENT OF THOSE THAT DRINK THEM WOULD SMELL OF THEM HOWEVER I WILL NOT SAY THAT IN ALL STOMACKS THERE IS THE LIKE COA GULATION BUT IF IN SOME THE SALTS ARE NOT ALTERED THE DRINKING OF WINE TO SUCH MEN IS VERY PREJUDICIAL BUT IT967 IT IS OTHERWISE WITH COMMON SALT FOR IF A SMALL QUANTITY OF THAT BE PUT IN WATER IT WILL PRESENTLY DIS SOLVE AND EVERY CORN BE DIVIDED INTO MILLIONS OF PARTS BEING ALL OF THEM FOUR SQUARE AND IF A GREAT DEAL OF SALT BE DISSOLVED IN WATER AND SOME OF THE WATER BE EVA PORATED THE SALT RUNS INTO GREAT CORNS NOW THAT IT IS TRUETHAT A GRAIN OF COMMONSALTIS DIVIDED INTO SQUARE PARTICLES A THOUSAND MILLIONS OF TIMES LESS THEN A SAND AND THAT EACH OF THESE PARTICLES IS AGAIN DIVIDED INTO AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE NUMBER OF OTHER PARTICLES BEFORE THEY WILL PASS FROM THE BOWELLS INTO THE BLOOD AND OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY THE ASSERTION WILL NOT SEEM STRANGE IF WE CONSIDER THAT IN INFECTS FOUND IN COMMON WATER AND OUR EXCREMENTSWHICH ARE NOT THE BIGNESS OF 11000000000 OF A GREAT SAND THERE IS A COAT OR SKIN AND PERHAPS SCALES ON IT THAT THERE ARE FEET OR FINS WHEREWITH IT SWIMS A MOUTH BOWELLS VEINS MUSCLES SINEWS AND ALL THE INWARDS AS COMPLEATLY AS IN THE GREATEST ANIMAL AND IF THE BODY OF SO SMALL A CREATURE MAY BE IMAGINED SO DIVISIBLE MUCH MORE MAY A PARTICLE OF SALT WHEN THE BLOOD HAS BEEN SOME TIMES OUT OF THE VEINS THE SMALL SALTS THEN BEGIN TO GO TOGETHER AND APPEAR AS I HAVE OFTEN SEEN AND PARTICULARLY WHILE I WAS LATE LY BUSIED ABOUT THE CRYSTALLIN HUMOUR OF THE EYE OF A MAN I OBSERVED A NUMBER OF SMALL SALT PARTICLES HAVE ING THE FIGURES OF COMMON SALT AND I AM PERSWADED THERE IS NOT A DROP OF BLOOD IN THE BODY WHICH HAS NOT ITS SHARE OF THEM HAVING THUS DECLARED MY OPINION UPON THE PARTS OF SALT I SHALL DO THE SAME UPON THOSE OF WATER FOR AS MUCH AS THAT A LATE AUTHOR HATH SPOKEN OF THEM WITH SUCH ASSURANCE THAT ORDINARY MEN COMING TO READ HIM IMAGINE THE SNAKES OF WHICH THE WATER IS MADE TO BE VERY BIG BUT IF I SHOULD TELL THEM THAT THOSE WATER SNAKES ARE SO LITTLE THAT IF A GREAT SANDWERE DIVIDED INTO A THOUSAND MILLION OF PARTS THE SNAKES X WOULD968 WOULD BE LESS THEN THEY I BELIEVE THIS LANGUAGE WOULD SOUND VERY HARSH FOR MY OWN PART I CANNOT CON CEIVE THE PARTS OF WATER TO BE LIKE SNAKES FOR I SUPPOSE HOW LITTLE SOEVER THEY ARE THEY ARE ALWAYS FLEXIBLE AND BY CONSEQUENCE PUT THEMSELVES INTO ALL FIGURES ACCORDING AS THEY ARE PREST BY THE AIR OR OTHER BODYS AND THAT WHEN MANY WATER PARTS ARE TOGETHER EACH TAKES A DIFFE RENT FORM THAT IT MAY APPLY IT SELF TO ITS NEIGHBOURS AND KEEP AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE A ROUND FIGURE AS I HAVE FORMERLY SAID OF THE PARTS OF FAT FOR EXAMPLE LET US IMAGINETHAT WE HAVE A GREAT NUMBER OF SHEEPS OR HOGS BLADDERS FILLD WITH WATER THESE AS THEY ARE HUNG UP IN AIR WILL BE ALL ROUND BUT AS THEY ARE HEAPT UP IN A TUN AND PRESS ONE ON ANOTHER WITH THEIR WEIGHT YIELD AND ACCOMMODATE THEMSELVES SO AS TO LEAVE NO EMPTY SPACE IN THE TUN THUS EVERY BLADDER HATH ITS PARTICULAR FIGURE THO IT MOST INCLINE TO BE ROUND MOREOVER IF THE TUN BE ROLLD EVERY BLADDER UPON THE LEAST MOTION WILL ALTER ITS FIGURE AS IT IS MORE OR LESS PREST IN THE SAME MANNER I BELIEVE IT IS WITH THE GLOBULES OF FAT IN OUR BODYS AND ALSO WITH THE PARTICLES OF WATER THO THESE LATTER I CONCEIVE TO BE SO SMALLTHAT IF A SAND WERE DIVID ED INTO A THOUSAND MILLIONS OF PARTSAND IF 11000000000 OF A SAND PARTICLEWAS AGAIN DIVIDED INTO A THOUSAND MILLIONS THE WATER PARTICLE WOULD STILL MAINTAIN THE ROUNDISH AND PLYABLE FIGURE I KNOW THIS ABOVE MENTIONED OPINION THAT WATER IS MADE AS IT WERE OF SNAKES IS NOT NEW BUT BORROWED FROM THE FAMOUS DES CARTES BUT WITH RESPECT TO THAT GREAT MAN EVERY ONE IS FREE TO DECLARE HIS JUDGMENT IN THINGS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY DISCOVERED I EXAMINED LATELY MY WINE WHICH IS VERY FINE AND WELL TASTED SUCH AS IN FRANCE IS CALLED VIN DE DAMOISSELLE THO IT IS BUT AN ORLEANS WINE BROUGHT DOWN THE LOYRE IN IT I SAW MANY EXTRAORDINARY PRETTY FIGURES OF DIFFERENT SIZES AND SOME VERY SMALL WHICH I SHALL CALL THE969 THE SALT OF THE WINE MANY OF THESE FIGURES WERE OF THE SAME MAKE WITH THOSE OF THE SALT OF VINEGAR ABOVE MENTIONED I HAVE IN SOME OF THESE FIGURES NOT ONLY SEEN A CAVITY BUT FOUND THEM ENCREASE TO SO GREAT A BIGNESS BY THAT TIME THE WINE HAD STOOD 24 HOURS UNCOVERED NPON MY TABLE THAT THEY EQUALLED THE THICK PARTICLES OF SALT WHICH I HAD SEEN IN VINEGAR AS IS HERE SHEWED NUMB 3 FIG A I SAW ALSO SOME FIGURES WHICH HAD NO SHARP POINTS BUT WERE ROUNDISH AT THE ENDS AS FIG B THERE WERE ALSO SEVERALL FIGURES WHICH GREW TAPERING AT ONE END AND AT THE OTHER WERE ROUND AS FIG C ALSO SOME FIGURES WHICH DIFFERED FROM FIG C IN THAT ONE OF THEIR ENDS WAS NOT ROUND BUT FLAT AS FIG D ALSO SOME FEW FIGURES WERE LONGISH REPRESENTING A THIN RIGHT ANGLED PARALLELOGRAM AS FIG E ALSO THERE WERE MANY FIGURES WHOSE TWO LONGEST SIDES WERE ROUNDISH AND WHOSE SHORTEST SIDES WERE STREIGHT RESEMBLING SOMETHING A BARRELL AS FIG FSOME FEW FIGURES MADE A PERFECT SQUARE OTHERS AGAIN WERE TWICE AS LONG AS THEYWERE BROAD BEING LARGEST IN THE MIDDLE AND INCLINING TOWARDS THE SHORTEST SIDES NOT MUCH UNLIKE A FLAT BOTTOMD BOAT WHOSE FORE AND AFTER PARTS ARE FLAT AS FIG G WHILE ALL THESE FIGURES IN GREAT NUMBERSWERE DRIVING TOGETHERIN THE QUANTITY OF A DROP OF WINE TWAS A PLEASURE TO ME TO SEE SO GREAT VARIETY THESE FORESAID SALTS I CONCEIVE WOULD BE SOUR UPON THE TONGUE IF THERE WERE NOT A GREAT MANY SWEET PARTICLES IN THIS AS WELL AS OTHER WINE MIXT WITH THEM WHICH ARE NOT OTHERWISE TO BE SEPARATED THEN BY SETTING THE WINE TO FERMENT FOR THEREBY IT PRESENTLY LOOSES OF ITS SWEETNESS AND IN TIMEIS CHANGED FROM A GRATEFULL WINE TO A SOUR VINEGAR FROM HENCE I GATHER THAT THE PLEA SANT RELISH OF WINE CONSISTS IN ITS HAVING NOT TOO MANY SWEET NOR TOO MANY SHARP PARTS BUT ONE SORT TEMPERING THE OTHER SO AS TO MAKE A HARMONY UPON THE TONGUE AND PALAT THE SAME THING WE EXPERIENCE DAYLY BY MIXING SEVERALL THINGS WHICH IF THEY WERE USED SIMPLE X 2 WOULD970 WOULD BE EITHER TOO SWEET OR TOO FLAT OR TOO SOUR WHERE OF I SHALL GIVE BUT ONE INSTANCE LET US MIX OR MELT TOGETHER BUTTER AND VINEGAR AND IT WILL PROVE A VERY GRATEFULL SAUCE AS TO SUGAR WHICH IS A SALT I HAVE FORMERLY SAID OF IT THE SWEETNESS HEREIN CONSISTS THAT THE ANGLES OR SHARP POINTS OF WHICH THE POWDER SUGAR IS MADE ARE EASILY SEPARATED FROM ONE ANOTHER AND DIS SOLVED WHEN THEY ARE PUT IN WATER CHIEFLY IF IT BE HOT WHICH HAPPENS TO SUGAR IN THE MOUTH FOR THEN IT IS NOT ONLY MELTED AND MIXED WITH THE SPITTLE BUT BECOMES SOFT AND PLYABLE EMBRACING ANY OTHER BODY IT FINDS ON THE TONGUE AND COMMUNICATING TO IT ITS PLEASANTNESS FROM THESE POSITIONS WE MAY WELL COMPREHEND THE SE VERALL TASTS THAT WINES ARE LYABLE TO THO THEY GROW IN THE SAME VINEYARD FOR NOT ONLY WILL THE BUNCHES THAT GROW ON THE SOUTHSIDE OF THE HILL BE SWEETER BE CAUSE THE HEAT OF THE SUN DRAWS FROM THEM THE SUPERFLU OUS MOISTURE BUT THE SHARP OR SALT PARTS IN THE WINE BY TAKING AWAY THE MORE WATERISH SUBSTANCE BECOME MORE RIGID AND STIFF ALSO WE MAY IMAGINE THE REASON WHY WINE HAVING STOOD SOME TIME IN THE OPEN AIRLOOSES ITS SAVOUR NAMELY THAT MANY SMALL SALT PARTICLES ARE JOINED TOGETHERTO MAKE A FEW GREAT ONES WHEREBY AS THE NUMBER OF THE SALTS ARE LESSENED THE SENSE IS NOT SO AGREABLY EXCITED AS IF IT WERE TOUCHT IN MORE PLACES THO THE BODYS THAT DO IT ARE NEVER SO SMALL I OBSERVED SOME SHERRY SACK WHICH PROVED TO BE AS GOOD THIS YEAR AS EVER WAS KNOWN AND THEREIN DISCO VERED THE FIGURES OF SALTSSUCH AS I HAVE ABOVE MENTION ED IN FRENCH WINE NUMB 3 FIG A AS ALSO SOME LONGISH FIGURES AS G BUT ALL THESE WERE BUT FEW IN COM PARISON OF THE FIGURES OF VINEGAR AND FRENCH WINE PER HAPS IF THE SHERRY HAD BEEN THINNER THE SALTS WOULD HAVE APPEARED MORE FOR THERE WERE MANY SMALL PARTICLES WHICH I COULD NOT DISCRIBE BECAUSE THEY WERE OBSCURED BY A THICK MATTER WHEREIN THEY LAY BUT WHEN I SET SOME SACK971 SACK UNCOVERED UPON MY TABLE FOR THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS I PERCEIVED IN IT A GREAT NUMBER OF SMALL PARTI CLES SOME WHEREOF HUNG BY ONE ANOTHER AND  LIKE THE DRY BRANCHES OF A TREE OTHERS MOVED CONFUS EDLY IN THE WINE SO AS I COULD NOT AT FIRST DETERMINE THEIR SHAPES BNT AFTERWARDS THEY SEEMD TO BE LIKE THE SALT PARTICLES ABOVE DESCRIBED HAVING AMONG THEM MANY FLAT FIGURES WITH THEIR SIDES TURNED UP THEIR SIZE WAS SO SMALL THAT I JUDGED A THOUSAND MILLIONS WOULD NOT MAKE UP THE QUANTITY OF A SAND IN CONTEMPLATING SOME GROSS FLAT PARTICLES AS ALSO SOME SHARP ONES WHICH WERE IMPERFECT I WAS CONFIRMED IN THE MAKE OF THOSE BODYS NAMELY THAT ALL THE SHARP SALT PARTICLES IN THE WINE AND VINEGAR HOW LITTLE SOEVER THEY ARE HAD AT FIRST FLAT THIN BODYS WHICH BY BEING ROLLD UP AT THE FOUR CORNERS MAKE THE SALTS I HAVE ABOVE DESCRIBED AS FOR EXAMPLE I SEE IN THE SACK NUMB 4 FIG A B C D AND E F G H THE SIDES OF THE ONE FIGURE ROUNDISH AND IR REGULAR AND OF THE OTHER STRAIT WHICH I HERE DRAW GREA TER THEN THEY APPEAR THAT THEIR MAKE MAY THE BETTER BE SEEN THE CORNERS A  B ARE BENT OR ROLLD UP AS FIG I K L WHEREBY THE CORNERS A AND B BECOME A SHARP AN GLE AS IS TO BE SEEN AT I IF THE OTHER TWO CORNERS C AND D WERE ALSO ROLLD UP IN THE SAME MANNER WE SHOULD SEE THE PERFECT FIGURE OF A SALT WHEN THE FLAT FIGURES ARE BUT SHORT AND ONLY TWO CORNERS ARE ROLLED UP THEY APPEAR AS Q OR R WHICH ARE LIKE THE FIGURES C AND D IN ORLEANS WINE THE APPEARANCE OF I K L AND M N O P WAS AS DISTINCT AS IF I HAD TAKEN HALF A SHEET OF PAPER AND ROLLD IT UP AT THE FOUR CORNERS TO MAKE TWO SHARP ANGLES AND LEAVE THE FULL BREADTH IN THE MIDDLE I COULD ALSO PERFEC TLY SEE A HOLLOWNESS WITHIN THE FIGURES AS MUCH AS CAN BE REPRESENTED IN THE PAPER I SET SOME MOSEL WINE FOR A FEW HOURS UNCOVERED UP ON MY TABLEAND THEN SAW SWIMMING IN ITDIVERS FIGURES OF SALT SUCH AS I HAD FORMERLY SEEN IN WINE VINEGAR X 3 AND972 AND SHERRY ONELY THERE WAS THIS DIFFERENCE THAT IN MANY OF THEM I COULD NOT ONLY PERCEIVE A THICKNESSAND A HOLLOWNESS BUT ALSO DISTINGUISH THAT EACH OF THEM CONSISTED OF 7 8 9 OR 10 PLATES LYING UPON ONE ANO THER THESE I AT FIRST DREW ROUGHLYAND AFTERWARDS GOT A GOOD ARTIST TO DRAW THEM AGAIN FROM THE OBJECTS THEMSELVES WITH A GOOD MISCROSCOPE AS HERE NUMB 5 FIG A I SAW ALSO SEVERALL FIGURES OUT OF THE TOP OF WHICH OTHER HALF FIGURES APPEARED AS FIG B THERE WAS SOME THING LIKE THIS IN THE ORLEANS WINE BUT NOTHING NEER SO MUCH AS HERE I SAW ALSO SEVERALL SALTS WHICH HAD O THER PARTICLES THRUST THRO THEM AS FIG C THERE WERE ALSO SOME FLAT FIGURES WHOSE SIDES WERE ROLLD UP AS FIG D AND SOME WHOSE SHORTEST SIDES WERE INDENTED AS FIG E SOME APPEARED LIKE HALF OF A AS FIG F A FEW OTHERS HAD THEIR ENDS BLUNT AS G BUT IT WAS VERY STRANGE THAT I COULD SEE NO SMALL FIGURES IN THE WINEWHEN IT HAD BEEN EXPOSED TO THE AIR 24 HOURS UPON MY TABLE YET WHEN IT HAD STOOD A DAY LONGERTHERE WERE FIGURES DISCERNABLE THO SO SMALL THAT I COULD NOT DISCOVER THEIR FASHIONBE CAUSE THAT THE MATTER THAT ENCOMPASSED THEM WAS VERY THICK I OBSERVED IN HOCKAMORE WINE OF A YEAR OLD WHICH WAS WELL TASTED AND GENEROUS AFTER IT HAD STOOD 3 HOURS UNCOVEREDTHAT THERE WERE SALT PARTICLES IN ITWHICH WERE SHARP AT BOTH ENDSHAVING A HEIGHTOR RIDGE UPON THEM LIKE THE SHARP BOTTOM OF A BOAT TURNED UPSIDE DOWN THOUGH THEY WERE OTHERWISE DIAPHANOUS AS NUMB 6 FIG A SUCH A KIND OF FIGURE HAS APPEARED TO ME IN FRENCH WINE BUT WHEN I LET THIS WINE STAND FOR TWO DAYS AND NIGHTS SOME OF THE SALT FIGURES WERE GREATER HAVING SEVERALL CIRCUMFERENCES SOME 2 3 4 AND OTHERS SO MANY THAT THEY COULD NOT BE COUNTED AS THEY LAY CLOSE TOGETHERSOME WERE SO BEAUTIFULL THAT NO SEA PRODUCTION WHETHER CORALL OR SHELLS MIGHT BE COMPARED TO THEM AS IN FIG B AMONG THESE FIGURES SOME WERE SO TRANSPA RENT973 RENT THAT THEIR CIRCUMFERENCES WERE NOT TO BE SEEN BUT SOME FEW SEEMED TO BE COMPOUNDED OF SMALL FIGURES OF THE SAME SHAPE I SAW SOME THAT WERE BLUNT AT BOTH ENDS YET ONE WOULD BE BLUNTER THEN ANOTHER AND SOME TIMES ONE END MORE THEN ANOTHER AS FIG C IN ANO THER PLACE I SAW SWIMMING IN THE WINE SALTS WHICH HAD NOT ONLY SEVERALL CIRCUMFERENCES BUT STEPS OR WRINKLES ACROSS AS AT D MOREOVER I SAW SOME LITTLE PAR TICLES OF DIFFERENT FIZES WHICH HAD THE AFORESAID CIRCUM FERENCES BUT MANY OF THEM EXACTLY REPRESENTED A WINE VESSEL AS SOME OF A FOEDER OR RHENISH WINE VESSEL O THERS A LONG TUN IN OBSERVING SOME PLACES WHERE THE THINNER PART OF THE WINE WAS EVAPORATED AWAY I FOUND SEVERALL FIGURES LIKE BRANCHES OR BOUGHS SEEMING TO PRO CEED FROM ONE SALT PARTICLE IN VIEWING THEM EXACTLY I SAW THAT THE BRANCHES CONSISTED OF NOTHING BUT VERY SMALL SALTS JOINED TOGETHER SOME WHEREOF WERE VERY REGULAR AND THE GREATEST WERE PLACED AT THE END OF THE BRANCHES AS AT F G H I IN THE BEGINNING OF DECEMBER LAST I OBSERVD THE HOCKAMOR WINE WHICH GREW IN THE YEAR 1678 AND FOUND AT FIRST VERY FEW SALT PARTICLES BUT WHEN I HAD LET THE WINE STAND 3 OR 4 DAYS THERE WERE MANY MORE THO IN MUCH LESSER NUMBERS THEN IN THE SAME WINE THAT WAS BUT OF A YEAR OLD BUT I AM PERSWADED THAT THE LARGEST OF THESE CONSISTED EACH OF ABOVE A HUNDRED SMALL ONES COMPACTED TOGETHER AS N 7 FIG A WHEN THE GREATEST SALTS WERE GOT TOGETHER THE SMALLER PARTICLES SWIM MING IN THE WINE CLEAVED TO THEM FOR THERE WERE NONE OF THEM TO BE SEEN ABOUT THE GREAT ONES THOUGH I SOUGHT FOR THEM TWELVE SEVERALL TIMES NOW AND THEN THERE WAS A FIGURE THAT SEEMED THE HALF OF THE AFOREMENTIONED AS B AND THEREBY SOME SMALL FIGURES WHICH WERE DIA PHANOUS AND WHOSE POINTS WERE NOT PROPORTIONABLY SHARP AS THE GREAT ONES AS FIG C THERE WERE ALSO SOME DIAPHANOUS PARTICLES GREATER THEN THE LAST MENTIONED HAVING974 HAVING A SMALL FIGURE IN THE MIDDLE AS D THERE WERE AL SO A FEW THAT WERE BLUNT AT THE ENDS AS E THERE WERE ALSO SOME RESEMBLING DRYED BRANCHES OF A TREE AS WAS MENTIONED IN WINE OF A YEAR OLD WHICH BRANCH LIKE FI GURES CONSISTED OF SMALL SALTS HANGING TOGETHER FROM THESE OBSERVATIONS I GUESS WHAT MAY BE THE CAUSE THAT RHENISH WINE NOT ONLY KEEPS GOOD A GREAT MANY YEARS IN A WELL STOPT VESSEL BUT ALSO LOOSES ITS SOURISH TAST AND TAKES ONE THAT IS SWEETER AND MILDER NAMELY FOR THAT THE SALT PARTICLES IN THE RHENISH WINE CLEAVE TOGETHER AND THEN STICK TO THE BOTTOM AND SIDES OF THE FAT BEING CALLED BY US TARTAR AND BY HOW MUCH OLDER THE RHENISH WINE ISBY SO MUCH ARE THE SALTS FEWER BUT THE NATURE OF FRENCH WINES IS CONTRARY AS I HAVE OBSERVED FOR THE SALTS IN A WELL STOPT VESSEL DO NOT RUN TOGETHER CHIEFLY IN BURDEAUX WINESAND THEREFORE THEY NEVER GET A MILDER OR SWEETER TAST BUT IN WINES THAT COME FROM NANTS THO THE SALTS RUN MORE TOGETHER NEVERTHELESS THE SWEETNESS IS PRESENTLY LOST I BOUGHT SOME WINE FOR RINCO VERY PLEASANT AND OF THE GROWTH OF 1683 BUT IT PROVED TO BE OF THE PALATI NATE AT FIRST I OBSERVED FEW SALTS IN IT BUT WHEN IT HAD STOOD OPEN 24 HOURS I DISCOVERED MANY THAT WERE SHARP AT EACH END AS N 8 FIG A HAVING A DIVISION RUN NING ALONG THEM BUT BEING OTHERWISE DIAPHANOUSAND APPEARING BY THE MICROSCOPE OF THE SAME BIGNESS HERE DRAWN BUT THERE WERE AN INNUMERABLE QUANTITY OF A LES SER SORT WHICH WERE OF THE SAME FIGURE I ALSO PERCEIVD SOME THAT RESEMBLED A WINE VESSEL BUT THEY PROVED TO HAVE TWO SIDES ROLLED UP AS FIG B AND PERHAPS OTHERS OF THE SAME FIGURE WHICH I HAVE BEFORE MENTIONED MAY BE ROLLD UP LIKE THEMIN REGARD I THEN MIGHT HAVE SEEN THEM ONELY BY THE PLAIN SIDE LIKEWISE MAY THE SALT FI GURES WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED AS BLUNT AT ONE OR BOTH ENDS BE LIKE C AND D I SAW ALSO FIGURES AS A WHICH HAD BOTH THEIR SHARP POINTS ROLLED UP TOGETHER AS AT C ALSO FI GURES975 GURES WHOSE ONE END WAS NOT ROLLD AS AT D SOME FEW FIGURES THERE WERE WHOSE BASIS WAS SQUARE HAVING THE SIDES RISING UP PYRAMIDAL LIKE A POINTED DIAMOND AS E BUT OF THESE THERE WERE NOT ABOVE ONE OR TWO IN A DROP OF WINE SOME TIMES ONE OF THESE FIGURES WOULD BE PLACE IN THE MIDDLE OF ANOTHER AS AT E WHICH RE MARKS IN SOME OTHER WINESI HAVE THOUGHT SCARCE DESERV ED TO BE MENTIONED SOME SALT FIGURES HAD THEIR SIDES ROLLD UP SO AS THE ENDS DID NOT TOUCH ONE ANOTHER BUT LEFT AN OPENING IN THE MIDDLE AS AT F WHEREAS OTHERS THAT WERE MORE SHUT SEEMD ONLY TO HAVE A LINE UPON THE BACK OF THEM SOMETIMES THERE APPEARED FIGURES LONG AND SLENDERAS GAS TO THESE LAST I AM IN DOUBT WHETHER THEY ARE COMPLEAT OR ONLY A BEGINNING OF A FIGURE THERE BEING SOME STUFF WANTING TO PERFECT THEM FOR THERE WERE FEW SWIMMING IN THE WINE BUT MOST OF THEM LAY IN PLACES THAT WERE ALMOST DRY BUT ABOVE ALL THE NUMBER OF A SORT OF SMALL SOFT PARTICLES WAS THE GREATEST TO WHICH I CAN ALLOT NO OTHER FIGURE THEN GLOBULAR THE WHOLE BODY OF THE WINE EXCEPT THE SALT PARTICLES SEEM ING TO CONSIST OF THEM AND THE SWEETNESS TO TAKE THENCE ITS RISE I TOOK A LITTLE RINCO WINE WHICH HAD WORKT IN THE FAT ALL THE FOREGOING SUMMER AND HAD BEEN PIERCED SOME WEEKS SINCE WHEN IT WAS FINE AND HAD A GOOD TAST THIS WINEWHEN IT HAD STOOD UPON MY TABLE ABOUT AN HOURS TIME HAD MANY SALT PARTICLES IN IT BUT AFTER IT HAD STOOD SIXTEEN HOURS THE SALTS WERE THICK AND HAD SUCH A DEEP BOATLIKE FIGURE AS I HAVE FORMERLY MENTION ED IN VINEGAR AND MAY BE HERE SEEN N 9 FIG A THERE WERE ALSO SEVERALL SALTS THAT HAD OTHER BROWN LONGISH FIGURES IN THE MIDDLE OF THEM AND SOME THAT HAD TWO THREE AND FOUR CIRCUMFERENCES AS FIG B SOME PARTI CLES HAD A LINE OR JOYNT RUNNING THRO THEM OTHERS WERE ALTOGETHER DIAPHANOUS AS FIG C OTHERS HAD ONE SHARP END AND THE OTHER BLUNT BY REASON THAT THEY WERE Y NOT976 NOT YET PERFECT AS I HAVE ABOVE MENTIONED AND SOME AGAIN WERE VERY DIAPHANOUS AS MAY BE SEEN UNDER THE LETTER D SOME FIGURES APPEARED AS E AND WHEN I LOOKT UPON THE PLACES WHERE THE WINE LAY THIN AND WAS AL MOST EVAPORATED I SAW A GREAT NUMBER OF PARTICLES THE MOST OF WHICH HAD TWO SHARP ENDSAND WERE A THOUSAND MILLIONS OF TIMES SMALLER THEN A GREAT SAND I SAW AL SO PARTICLES OF SALT SWIMMING ABOUT WHICH HAD THE TRUE SHAPE OF A WINE VESSEL BUT THEY WERE VERY THIN AND CLEAR AND I COULD NOT PERCEIVE ANY LINE OR JOYNT GOING THROUGH THEM THERE WERE ALSO SEVERALL OBLONG PARTI CLES VERY THIN AND CLEAR AND THEREWITHALL VERY SMALL THO THEY BE DRAWN GREAT AS AT FIG H BECAUSE I WAS FORCED TO USE TO F AND H A LESSER MICROSCOPE THEN TO THE OTHER SIX LETTERS A B C D E AND G ALSO WHEN THE WINE HAD LAYN THINTHERE WERE SEVERALL BRANCHLIKE FIGURESCON SISTING OF IRREGULAR SALTS THE SHAPE OF MANY WHEREOF COULD NOT WELL BE EXPREST I EXAMINED CERONCE WINE AND FOUND THE SALTS TO BE MOSTLY AS N 10 FIG A SOME OF WHICH WERE AS IT WERE ROLLD UP OTHERS WERE THIN AND PELLUCID AND OTHERS WHEN THE WINE HAD STOOD LONG WERE SO THICK THAT THEY HAD A BROWN CIRCUMFERENCE ABOUT THEM AS FIG B SE VERALL WERE LIKE THE HALF OF A AND B AS FIG C I EXAMINED ALSO COTEAU WINE AND FOUND SEVERALL PAR TICLES AS A B C N 10 AND MOREOVER SEVERALL WHOSE SIDES WERE ROLLED UP AS FIG D ALSO FLAT FIGURES WHOSE LONGEST SIDES WERE STRAIT AND BOTH THE ENDS CIRCULAR AS FIG E ALSO SALTS HAVING A SHARP POINT AS FIG F AL SO PARTICLES REPRESENTING A FLAT BOTTOMD BOAT TURND UP SIDE DOWN AS FIG G OTHER OF THE SAME MAKE I COULD LOOK INTO AS INTO A CAVITY THERE WERE ALSO SEVERALL VERY SMALL AND LONG PARTICLES AS FIG H WHICH I IMAGINE IF THEY HAD MORE STUFF WOULD HAVE BEEN AS E THERE WERE LIKEWISE SOME SALTS AS FIG I I ALSO OBSERVED TONSAIN WINE WHICH WAS VERY THICK AND977 AND SWEET THO MANY IN THIS PLACE DO THINK THAT THE SWEETNESSWHICH THIS WINE HAS HADFOR 4 YEARS PAST IS NOT NATURALL BUT PROCURED BY BRIMSTONE HIGH COUNTRY WINE OR SYRUPS I FOUND THE SALTS TO BE THE SAME AS THOSE IN COTEAU WINEBUT NOT SO MANY IN NUMBER AS THEY THIS ONLY DIFFERENCE THERE WAS BETWEEN THEM THAT IN THE TONSAIN WINE SEVERALL FIGURES HAD AS IT WERE STAIRS OR PAR TITIONS IN THEM AS FIG 10 LETTER K I TOOK TONSAIN WINE WHICH WAS SAID TO BE PURE AND UNMIXT AND DISCOVERED IN IT ALL THE SALTS MENTIONED IN COTEAU AND TONSAIN WINE BUT I JUDGED THAT THE NUMBER OF THE SALTS IN THIS FERMENTING TONSAIN WINE WAS 25 TIMES MORE THEN IN THE SWEET TONSAIN WINE BUT NOT SO BIG AS THEY ALSO THE SALTS IN THIS LAST WINE AFTER A FEW HOURS SWAM ABOUT BUT IN THE SWEET WINES THE SALTS WERE A GREAT WHILE BEFORE THEY APPEARED I FOUND LIKEWISE IN CITERUSE WINE ALL THE SEVERALL SALTS WHICH WERE IN TONSAIN AND COTEAU WINE IN GREAT QUAN TITY I TOOK HIGH COUNTRY WINE OF THE DEEPEST SORT AND FOUND SWIMMING IN IT VERY FEW SALT FIGURES THO I LET IT STAND 3 DAYS AND NIGHTS BUT THE SALTS WERE MUCH BIG GER THEN IN THE COTEAU AND FINE TONSAIN WINE AND HAD THE SHAPE OF A B D AND G IN N 10 I TOOK RHENISH WINE TARTAR BEATEN VERY SMALL AND PUT IT IN FAIR RAINWATER AND WHEN THE WATER WAS SETL ED I SAW IN IT MANY SUCH FIGURES AS I HAVE MENTIONED TO BE IN THE WINE VIZ SOME WHICH WERE VERY CLEAR AND HAD TWO SHARP ENDS AS N 10 FIG L BUT THE MOST OF THEM WERE VERY IRREGULAR THE CAUSE WHEREOF MAY BE THAT THERE WAS NO SWEET OR OYLY STUFF MIXED WITH THEM I TOOK THE TARTAR OF FRENCH WINE AND EXAMINING IT IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE FORMER I FOUND SOME SALTS WHICH AGREED PERFECTLY WITH THOSE IN THE WINE BUT THE REST OF THEM WERE MORE IRREGULAR THEN IN THE TARTAR OF RHENISH WINE Y 2 I978 I TOOK ORLEANCE WINE PURE AS IT CAME OUT OF THE VES SEL AND PUT INTO EVERY DROP AS NEER AS I COULD GUESS A PIECE OF CRABSEY AS BROAD AS THE KNIFE AND WHEN IT HAD STOOD 3 HOURS I COULD FIND NO SUCH SALT IN IT AS I HAD SEEN IN THE WINE THAT HAD NO CRABSEYS BUT THERE WERE VERY MANY SALTSWHOSE BASIS WERE AN OBLONG SQUARE AND THE SIDES ROSE UP PYRAMIDALL OTHER SALTS WERE FLATAS N II FIG A OTHERS WERE SIX SIDED AS FIG B OTHERS HAD TWO SLANTING SIDES AS FIG C SOME FEW QUADRILATE RALLS HAD FOURSIDED FIGURES WITHIN THEM AS D OTHERS OF THEM HAD THE SHORTEST SIDES SOMETHING IRREGULAR SOME SALTS WERE AS FIG E IN THESE LAST I COULD PERCEIVE NO RISING PERHAPS BECAUSE THEY WERE VERY LITTLE AS I VIEW ED A PIECE OF CRABSEYS I SAW RISING AS IT WERE FROM A POINT IN ABOUT FIFTY PLACES SEVERALL THIN PIPES AS CLEER AS CHRISTALL ONE WHEREOF WAS LONGER THEN ANOTHER BUT THEY WERE ALL GENERALLY OF THE SAME THICKNESS I LIKEWISE TOOK WINE AND PUT WHITE CHALK INTO IT IN THE SAME QUANTITY AS BEFORE LETTING IT STAND ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR BEFORE I OBSERVED IT AND THEN I FOUND A GREAT NUMBER OF THE AFORE MENTIONED SALTS BUT THEY WERE NOT SO BIG AS THOSE IN THE WINE MIXED WITH CRABSEYS BUT WHEN THIS WINE AND CHALK HAD STOOD ABOUT 12 OR 14 HOURES I SAW THE SALTS ABOVE MENTION ED NOT ONLY GREATER BUT THE PIPES LIKEWISE IN SEVERALL PLACES ROSE FROM A POINT OF CHALK IN GREAT QUANTITIES AS ABOVE IN N II FIG F THESE PIPES ALSO WERE BIG GER THEN THE OTHERS THO THEY DIFFERED SOMETIMES IN BIG NESS AMONG THEMSELVES THE WINE THAT HAD CRABS EYS IN IT HAD A KIND OF A SKIN UPON IT WHICH I JUDGD TO PROCEED FROM ITS SWEET PARTICLES BUT THE WINE THAT HAD CHALK IN IT HAD NONE AND REMAINED VERY THIN I PUT INTO RINCO WINE SOME PIECES OF CRABSEYS AND AFTER 12 OR 15 MINUTES DISCOVERED A FEW SALTS IN IT BUT WHEN THE WINE HAD RESTED SOME HOURS I FOUND IN IT A VERY GREAT NUMBER OF

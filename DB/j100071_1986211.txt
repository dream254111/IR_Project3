HASTINGS MOORE INTRODUCTION In this paper I consicler the improper simple definite integrals of HARNACK 1883 1884 In the introduction I wish to characterize somuewhat clearly the theories of the improper simple and multiple integrals recently given by JORDAN 1894 and STOLZ 1898 1899 and in this introductory paragraph I summarize the contents of the whole introduction These theories for the simple integrals have intimate relations with the HARNACK theory The definition adopted for the multiple integrals is inore exacting than that for the simple ilntegrals The miiultiple integrals converge or exist as limits only absolutely For the simple integrals we have then two theories on the one hanld of the integrals with the milder definition and on the other hand of the integrals with the stronger de finition and so with a larger body of properties The first class of integrals in cludes the second class of integrals The HARNACK theory relates to the first and general class of integrals this theory has not received systellmatic develop ment however for the theory of the absolutely conivergent HARNACK integrals this is nlot true and these initegrals conistitute the second and special class of integrals I discuss both classes of simple integrals simultaneously and by uni form process this is made possible by suitable determinations of the definitions the absolute convergence of the integrals of the seconid class appears only at the conclusion and hence it is desirable to introduce terms of discriminiation conl noting the two definitions the milder ancl the stronger the terms chosen narrow  broad connote the geometric form of the definitions and likewise the fact that the class of narrow integrals lhas a less extensive body of properties than the included class of broad integrals There has been a tendency to do away with the nonabsolutely convergent HARNACK integrals I hope to show that this tendency rests uponi misconceptionsThe tlheory of DE LA VALLfE POUSSIN initiated in 1892 is in form distinct from the HARNACK theory and  Presented to the Society Chicago December 28 1900 Received for publication June 12 1901 296OF IMPROPER DEFINITE INTEGRALS 297 relates primarily to absolutely convergent integrals It is not involved in the present paper HARNACK in papers ptublished in 1883 and 1884 in volumes 21 and 24 of the M a t h e m a t i s c h e A i nn a l e ni first gave a definition for the notion of an improper definite integral from a to b of a real function F x having these two properties 1 The function Fx assumes values indefinitely great in the neighborhood of points g constituting a pointset f Z lying on the interval ab and of content zero alnd 2 The function F x is properly integrable in the lneighborhood of every other point x of ab or what is equivalent it is properly initegrable from a to b where ab is any interval of ab which contains no point g HARNACKS definition was formally a definiition not so mluch of the definite integral 1 fb x dxr itself as of the definite integral fuLnction JXJ Fxdx X of atb Indeed his definition in coimion with many limiiitdefinitions of that period alnd of earlier periods was not expressed in explicit form From the colntext olne may infer that HARNACK was so desirous of passing to the less immediate applications of the notion that he was unwilling to attend to the systematic exposition of the funidamental elemelnts of the theory Thus he was led inlto errorwith respect to the gelneral theory niotably in the theorem  If the set Z of singularities of the function Fx is reducible and so of content zero and a contilnuous function  x of x on ab exists for which t   F xdx for every interval xx of ab containiing nio singularity g then the integral Antcendung der

converges and has the value  x ba This theorem was designed to show that the improper definite integrals definedl by H6LDER Mathematische Annalen vol 24 1884 p 190 fg are special cases of the HARNACK integrals the set Z being reducible And this does follow by the elucidations of H6LDER as to the uniqueness of his definite in tegrals whenever the corresponding HARNACK integrals exist Thus the HAR NACK integrals with reducible sets of singularities are HOLDER integrals and the H6LDER integrals for which the corresponding HARNACK integrals wvith re ducible sets of singularities exist are these HARNACK integrals By examples in  5 40 90 I show that each system of integrals is more extensive than their common subsystem I accept the sharp formulation of the limitdefiniition of the integral 1 given by STOLZ t 1898 as doubtless a correct expression of the content of HARNACKS meaning As SCHOENFLIES t has remarked the generalized simple definite integrals of JORDAN Cours danalyse ed 2 vol 2 1894 pp 46 50 fg are  HARNACKs improper integrals although there is no reference to HARNACK and the form of exhibition is different JORDAN loc cit p 46 selects two properties of the  I think of the integral as a limit that is as a certain number obtained by a certain limiting process and prefer to say in general that the limit exists rather than that it converges the limit and expression converges to the number in question as its limit tThe fuill reference is given below tJahresbericht der Deutschen MathematikerVereinigung vol 8 Bericht 1900 p 176SCHOENFLIES Ioc cit p 186 gives suggestively but not explicitly a defini tion of the HARNACK integrals in terms involving the set of nonoverlapping intervals of atb which enclose no point  and every point not enclosed by ab One may form three explicit definitions in these terms The third definition agrees with the definition given by STOLZ and the second is equivalent to it while the first which alone fully expresses the implications to me of the language used by SCHOENFLIES is a definition considerably milder  At least if the content of the set r of points c loc cit p 50 is zero SCHOENFLIES sug gests that a condition to this effect may have been unintentionally omitted But JORDAN defines loc cit p 76 double integrals without the insertion of the analogous condition for contrary to a statement of SCHOENFLIES he speaks merely of the interior content of the region of integra tion However in the case of the simple integrals if this condition is omitted the theorem cited in the text will fail whenever the condition for fbFx dx is not satisfied even for all fa cases in which Gx is a nonzero constant It may be noted here that JORDANS set r is the set of all points c in whose neighborhood the function Fx is not capable of proper integration Thus the set r includes HARNACKS set Z But we have the theorem that the set r is HAR NACKS set Z in case r has content zero and the improper definite integral exists Cf theorem VIIA of  31901 OF IMPROPER DEFINITE INTEGRALS 299 proper integrals which serve to suggest the explicit definiition of the gener alized integrals But the theorems of the sequel and the reference theo rem implied p 226 11 9 10 in the proof of the second mean value theorem for the generalized integrals certainly need fuller proofs indeed the theorem that f Fx  G x d7x exists and fFx  Gx Cldx F J x X b xdx in case the integrals on the right exist is not in general true In  5 8 I give a simple example in which the integral in question does not exist Quite recently HARNACKS theory without reference to JORDANS theory has been considered systematically and critically by STOLZ first in 1898 in a paper t entitled Zur Erkldrung dec absolut convergenten uneigentlichen Inteqracle and then in 1899 with but slight modificationis in appendix III to volume 3 of his Grundziige der Difrerential atnd Integralrechnuny alnd further immediately thereafter in 1899 in a paper entitled Uber lie absolute Convergenz der un eigeqntichen bestinrnteia Intearale t STOLZ gives  an explicit definition of the HARNACK integral 1 as a certain limit and then considering the theory of these integrals he affirms that it fails to justify for the limit in question the notation and designation definite integral that one has not even the property that if f Fx dx exists so do all the integrals fcF dx a c b Contenting himself at this point with an affirmation STOLZ turns to the theory of the absolutely convergent integrals 1 that is those for which also the corresponding integral f IFxl dx exists and finds  that these integrals deserve the name since they possess certain four fundamental properties The definition given by STOLZ has application with respect to any pointset lying on the interval ab and of content zero which contains the set Z used by HARNACK and in so far his definition is formally more comprehensive than HARNACKS definition This extension was necessary for the formulation of the third and fourth of the four fundamental propositions which are as follows Under the hypothesis that Fx is absolutely integrable from a to b with re spect to a pointset of content zero I Fx is likewise integrable from a to c and from c to b where c is any point of ab and Theorem 3  58 p 56This theorem would follow directly from HARNACKS erroneous theorem 2 cited above t

quence of the first two and that the fourth is an immediate consequence of the third As to the corresponding theorems for the HARNACK integrals in general I shall show   3 V VIII  that the first is in fact true notwithstanding the state ment of STOLZ to the contrary the second is the erroneous theorem 2 of HAR NACK and the fourth is the erroneous theorem 3 of JORDAN Indeed the valid ity of the second theorem for a HARNACK integral implies its absolute con vergence cf  2 def 1 note 1 footnote and  4 III The second theorem is in effect a gelneralization of the uniform continuity of the definite integral function Jx for the nolnabsolutely convergent HARNACK integrals the uni form continuity of Jx holds  3 IX  5 6 The limitdefinition of the integral 1 relates to the various intervalsets I of a finite number of intervals enclosing all points g or 4 of the set Z or  in notation 1 1Z or I According to the implication of HARNACK and of STOLZ and the explicit statement of JORDAN Ioc cit p 51 top every interval of I encloses at least one poilnt  or t  JORDANS definitionst for the improper simple and multiple integrals relate to closedc measurable regions D lying within

the basis of PRINGSHEIMS rejection of HARNACKS extension An nalen vol 21 p 326 of that theorem to the general improper integrals the theorem as extended is however correct and the followv ing

DEFINITE INTEGRALS 301 of integration and containing no singularity c For the simple integrals the complemientary region E  D is the intervalset I Ir each of whose intervals encloses a poilnt c For the multiple integrals the corresponding con dition is not imposed and accordingly the condition for the existence of the improper integral is stronger andl JORDAN proves that the multiple integrals as defilned exist only absolutely For the simple integrals the correspondiing theoremii does niot hold and JORDAN p 87 remarks that the loss of the theorem is due to the fact that the definition for the simple integrals is less exacting although he expresses himself somewhat obscurely in terms of one dimension not capable of immediate extension to more dimensions STOLZ t develops the JORDAN definition of improper double integrals for the case t of a region E with ordinary boundaries on which all the singularities c lie The onedimensional analogue of this case is that of a finite interval E with singular extrenmities and for the simple integrals D is a subinterval of E In his last paper  STOLZ following WIRTINGER notices that if as in two dimensionis the D is allowed to be an intervalset the improper integrals exist onily absolutely This we have seen was the implication of the remnark of JORDAN Anid further he likewise notices as a generalization for the special case of the theorem of JORDAN that the double integrals would still exist only absolutely even if they were given a less exacting definition the region D being required to be as in the case of the simple integrals connected jj or of on piece To revert to the general case of multiple integrals it is now apparent that for a definition formally less exacting than JORDANS we may impose on the region D which convergres to E the conditions 1 the region E  D consists of one or more regions each being of olne piece and each enclosing a singular point c 2 the region D consists of onie or more regions each being of one piece and no two being capable of unlion as parts of an including connected re gion D 3 the region D consists of a finite number of conniected regions And these coniditionis on the region D may be imposed or not imposed indepen dently of one another In this paper I confine attention to the simple integrals over a finite interval F  ab the conditions 1 anid 2 then become

theories simultanieously we obtain a new insight into the varying properties of the general and the abso lutely convergent HARNACK integrals In my judgment the general integralseven the nonabsolutely convergenit in tegralsdeserve to be classed with the proper definite integrals under the desig nation definite integrals To be sure they lack in general many fundamenltal properties of the absolutely convergent integrals We may however look at these matters in such a way that the properties of the differenit classes are more nearly equiivalent Let us think not of the proper or improper definite integral but more generally of the definite integral with respect to a pointset  of content zero and thus write for inistance f x dx and speak of the integrals Then for every E there is a theory of the narrow and of the broad integrals anid for the various sets  these theories in so far as they relate to a single set or to a single set  and its subsets  includinig the set Z of singll larities of the integral function Fx are to a large extent the same I remark in passinig that the desirable theorem  2 V if Fx is sin tegrable from a to b and the set Z is nonexistent then Fx is properly in teorable from a to b and FxFlx  fb Fx cx holds only if the content of the set S is zero And in this fact I see one of the strongest reasons for con sidering only such sets In the sequel the theories of the narrow and the broad HARNACK integrals are developed from this point of view and otherwise essentially in the spirit of the original HARNACK papers The necessary fixed hypotheses etc being intro duced in  1 I give in  2 for the integrals the definitionis aind a number of ftundamental theorems and then in  3 I develop the properties of a function Fx 5integrable from a to b I bound the inquiry of  3 in effect by the form of the four fundamental theoreins of STOLZ Then in  4 the questions of absolute convergence are introduced And in  5 added July 1 1901 after exhibiting an important condition necessary and sufficient for the existence of the general or narrow HARNACK integral I construct for the general closed pointset S on ab of content zero a Sintegral from a to b for which the set S is the set Z of singularities and which is near every point x t essenitially nar row or noiiabsolutely convergent and in coninectioni with the simplest case  b I exhibit the examples nleeded to show the error of various statemenits already referred to  1 FUNDAMENTAL IIYPOTHESES DEFINITIONS AND NOTATIONS 1 WVe consider the finite interval cab of values of the real variable x In the proofs of the propositions we shall consider the case t  b to whieh the case a  b is immediately reducible1901 OF IMPROPER DEFINITE INTEGRALS 303 2 We consider furtlher a poiintset 5 of points t which is of conltent zero As explained in  2 the set w will later be supposed to be closed this supposi tioln involves no restriction of genierality The aggregate or sum1 2 of two sets Sl S2 each closed anid of contenlt zero is again a set of the sanme kind 30 On the interval ab the real function F x is supposed to be single valued wherever definled and it is supposed to be defined certainly at all points x nlot of  Mloreover it is supposed that F x is capable of proper definite integra tioni from a to b where the interval ab is any interval lying onl the initerval ab anid conitaining no point t and no limitpoint  of  4 With respect to Fx it is conlvenient to separate poinits x  x into two classes The point x  is regular if near x i e oni somiie initerval x 8  xo0  8 F x is everywhere defined single valued and limited and otherwise it is simngular A singular point x  may be both progressively and regressively singular or merely progressively  C or regressively  C sinuular We speak of the singularities  and of the singular poinltset Z of all points C The set Z is closed Obviously every singular poilnt  is a point t or a limitpoint  of  if the set  is closed the set Z is a subset of it 5 A finite number of intervals such that no two have a common point is called an intervalset Denoting by I an intervalset we denote its length the Sulm1 of the lengths of its intervals by D 6 Two intervals i i having a coinmon inner point determinie a definite in terval 1 i2 common to il ald i2 Two intervalsets 1 J2having a common inner point determine a definite intervalset II  12 which may be called the set of ihtervals common to 1I 2J that is every i12 of I12 is the interval com moni to certain two intervals iI of J1 i2 of f The set common to a set I and an interval x1x2 is denoted by I For brevity especially in partitioning intervalsets it is sometimes convenient to use these niotations even when the intervalsets in question do not exist for example an intervalset I is by an interval x1x2 separated into two interval sets III I of which one may not exist and we write I I2 1 7  An intervalset I is said to contain any pointset S all of whose poinlts are points of I and in this case S is said to be of or to lie on I Further an intervalset is said to enclose a pointset S if every point s and likewise every limitpoint s of S lies within some interval of I and in this case S is said to be an inner set of or to lie within I The intervalset I is said to contain or to enclose the pointset S narrowly and S to lie respectively on or within I nar rowly if furthermnore every interval of I contains or encloses at least onie point s of AS It is convenient to denote by IS an intervalset which enleloses S narrowly and by I S one which encloses S not necessarily niarrowly or say one which encloses S broadly Thus the broad is the generic elnclosure and the narrow is a specific enclosure304 E H MOORE CONCERNING HARNACKS THEORY July 8 The set Z being by hypothesis of content zero for any positive number e there an intervalset I enclosing Z narrowly and of length DI e 9 On the fixed interval ab in connection with any intervalset I not neces sarily lyinog on the interval ab we introduce a functioni Fx by the following stipulation according as the point x of ab lies or does not lie on I F1x has the value 0 or Fx with the understanding that if I is the symbol of a non existent intervalset F1x  Fx for every x of ab It is to be noticed that if I encloses  thein Fx is on the interval ab everywhere defined single valued limnited and capable of proper definite

adjectives narrow and broad may connote the fact that the body of properties of the narrow integrals is less extensive than and included in the body of properties of the broad integrals The essentially narrow integrals are the notbroad narrow integrals  This definition of the narrow Zintegral seems to express for Z exactly HARNACKS meaning in form as well as in content HARNACK defines the improper definite integral over a certain interval as a certain limit of the proper definite integral over the same interval of a modified function There are certain advantages cf the remark of  3 VI in this type of definition A different definition of this type is that of DE LA VALLUE PoUssIN for the absolutely convergent generalized definite in tegrals With respect to this matter SCHOENFLIES Ioc cit pp 186 187 has erred in setting in contrast thetwo limiting processes in question t To the various ds related in this paper to the arbitrary positive e I give the notations 1d  2 etc where the superscripts are discriminating affixes and not exponents t This fundamental definitional property of a function F x Zintegrable from a to b is with modification of the de considerably extended in

limitpoints  of  coexist and are equal that is if either exists so does the other with the same valueThe set   is closed and of content zero TVe suplpjose hereafter that the set i s closed This

an intervalset every interval of which contains a point t These intervals of i are the intervals arising by the excision fromii i of its various parts i The interval i itself contains a poilnt  If it

theorem XIII in connection with the stipulations b DK  8KC 8 e3 In order to secure this application of theorem XIII we are to determine the positive number c so that every interval 1 join ing two consecutive intervals of Jh either contains a poilnt t or lies within the cneighborhoodl of no point  This determination is made by means of the final condition of the theorem 1Ve denote by H the set

while their interval ab wIXenever it contains no point  is of length at least 3  and hence their joininginterval 1 whenever it contains no point  is of length greater than c and so lies within the

OF IMPROPER DEFINITE INTEGRALS 327 In 40 I use such an integral 20 for the case ab  01 as the element for a simple construction according to the conditions of 20 of a iintegral for the general set E of ab nonabsolutely convergent in the neighborhood of every point  4 We denote by F x  x a function on the xinterval 01 continuous except at x  1 for which the integral Fx dx 1 converges nonabsolutely A function F x xabx of similar character on the interval ab a c b is given by the transformation abX  01 x  bax  a Denoting the middle point of ab by c we denote by Xab x the function on ab everywhere continuous except at a and b which on ac is ca x and on cb is fb x The functions XLb x are derivable from X0o x by the transformation used above The integral rb Xllb Xd a b converges nonabsolutely near a and b Then with respect to any set  1 we construct a fatnction Fx everywhere contitnuous on ab except at its singularities t and such that the integral b Fx dx converges nonabsolutely near every point t The function Fx is on ab the function Xavb X or 4bV if a  a  nota or ba if bv  b  nota The effectiveness of this construction follows easily from the theorem of 20 since the oscillations

J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,106659,DESCRIPTION OF A NEW ELECTRICAL INSTRUMENT CAPABLE OF COLLECTING TOGETHER A DIFFUSED OR LITTLE CONDENSED QUANTITY OF ELECTRICITY BY MR TIBERIUS CAVALLO F R S,I206940,255 XVI DESCRIPTION OF A NEW ELECTRICAL INSTRUMENT CAPABLE OF COL LECTING TOGETHER A DIFFUSED OR LITTLE CONDENSED QUANTITY OF ELEC TRICITY BY MR TIBERIUS CAVALLO F R S READ APRIL 10 1788 O N E OF THE PRINCIPAL DESIDERATA IN PRACTICAL ELECTRICITY HAS BEEN A METHOD OF ASCERTAINING THE PRESENCE AND QUALITY OF SUCH DIFFUSED OR WEAK ELECTRICITY AS COULD NOT IMMEDIATELY AFFECT AN ELECTROMETER OF THIS NATURE IS THE ELECTRICITY PRO DUCED BY EFFERVESCENCES AND OTHER PROCESSES THE ELECTRICITY OF THE ATMOSPHERE IN SERENE AND WARM WEATHER C M VOLTAS CONDENSER WHICH IS DESCRIBED IN VOLUME LXXII OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS WAS THE FIRST AT TEMPT OF THE KIND AND INDEED WHEN THIS INSTRUMENT IS IN GOOD ORDER IT ANSWERS EXCEEDINGLY WELL BUT THE DIFFICULTY OF CONSTRUCTING AND OF PRESERVING IT ADDED TO THE FREQUENT UNCER TAINTY OF THE RESULT IT BEING DIFFICULT TO SAY WHETHER IN CER TAIN CASES THE ELECTRICITY OBTAINED COMES FROM THE INSTRUMENT ITSELF OR FROM THE SUBSTANCE IN QUESTION HAVE OCCASIONED ITS BEING LITTLE IF AT ALL USED BY THOSE WHO STUDY THE SUBJECT OF ELECTRICITY MR BENNETS DOUBLER WHICH IS DESCRIBED IN VOLUME LXXVII OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS WAS ALSO IN TENDED TO MANIFEST SMALL AND OTHERWISE UNPERCEIVABLE QUAN TITIES OF ELECTRICITY BUT FROM THE EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS WHICH I HAD THE HONOUR OF LAYING BEFORE THE ROYAL SOCIETY IN NOVEMBER LAST IT SEEMS TO BE CLEARLY SHEWN THAT THIS DOU BLER256 MR CAVALLOS DESCRIPTION OF A BLER CANNOT BE OF ANY USE ON ACCOUNT OF ITS BEING NATURALLY ALWAYS ELECTRIFIED IN THE SAME PAPER OF LAST NOVEMBER I LIKEWISE SHORTLY MEN TIONED A METHOD WHICH I HAD USED FOR COLLECTING DIFFUSED QUAN TITIES OF ELECTRICITY SINCE THAT TIME I HAVE IMPROVED THE METHOD AND AFTER SEVERAL ALTERATIONS HAVE CONSTRUCTED AN IN STRUMENT FOR THE PURPOSE WHICH TO ALL MY FRIENDS WHO ARE CONVERSANT IN ELECTRICITY AS WELL AS TO MYSELF SEEMS TO BE FREE FROM ALL THOSE FAULTS WHICH RENDER M VOLTAS AND MR BEN NETS INSTRUMENTS OF LITTLE IF AT ALL OF ANY USE IT SEEMS THEREFORE THAT THE FOLLOWING DESCRIPTION OF THIS NEW INSTRU MENT MAY BE OF USE TO THOSE WHO ARE PURSUING ELECTRICAL EXPE RIMENTS AND INVESTIGATIONS THE PROPERTIES OF THIS MACHINE WHICH FROM ITS OFFICE MAY BE CALLED A COLLECTOR OF ELECTRICITY ARE FIRST THAT WHEN CONNECTED WITH THE ATMOSPHERE THE RAIN OR IN SHORT WITH ANY BODY WHICH PRODUCES ELECTRICITY SLOWLY OR WHICH CONTAINS THAT POWER IN A VERY RAREFIED MANNER IT COLLECTS THE ELECTRICITY AND AFTERWARDS RENDERS BOTH THE PRESENCE AND QUALITY OF IT MANIFEST BY COMMUNICATING IT TO AN ELECTROMETER SECONDLY THIS COL LECTING POWER BY INCREASING THE SIZE OF THE INSTRUMENT AND ESPECIALLY BY USING A SECOND OR SMALLER INSTRUMENT OF THE LIKE SORT TO COLLECT THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE FORMER MAY BE AUG MENTED TO ANY DEGREE THIRDLY IT IS CONSTRUCTED MANAGED AND PRESERVED WITH EASE AND CERTAINTY AND IT NEVER GIVES NOR CAN IT GIVE AN EQUIVOCAL RESULT AS I HAVE PROVED EXPERIMEN TALLY AND AS WILL APPEAR BY CONSIDERING ITS CONSTRUCTION THE ANNEXED DRAWING EXHIBITS TWO PERSPECTIVE VIEWS OF THIS COLLECTOR FIG 1 TAB IV SHEWS THE INSTRUMENT IN THE STATE OF COLLECTING THE ELECTRICITY AND FIG 2 SHEWS IT IN THE STATE IN WHICH THE COLLECTED ELECTRICITY IS TO BE RENDERED MANIFEST AN ELECTROMETERNEW ELECTRICAL INSTRUMENT 257 ELECTROMETER IS ANNEXED TO EACH THE LETTERS OF REFERENCE INDI CATE THE SAME PARTS IN BOTH FIGURES ABCD IS A FLAT TIN PLATE THIRTEEN INCHES LONG AND EIGHT INCHES BROAD TO THE TWO SHORTER SIDES OF WHICH ARE SOLDERED TWO TIN TUBES AD AND BC WHICH ARE OPEN AT BOTH ENDS DE AND CF ARE TWO GLASS STICKS COVERED WITH SEALING WAX BY MEANS OF HEAT AND NOT BY DISSOLVING THE SEALING WAX IN SPIRITS THEY ARE CEMENTED INTO THE LOWER APERTURES OF THE TIN TUBES AND ALSO IN THE WOODEN BOTTOM OF THE FRAME OR MACHINE AT E AND F SO THAT THE TIN PLATE ABCD IS SUPPORTED BY THOSE GLASS STICKS IN A VERTICAL POSITION AND IS EXCEEDINGLY WELL INSULATED GHILKM AND NOPV ARE TWO FRAMES OF WOOD WHICH BEING FASTENED TO THE BOTTOM BOARDS BY MEANS OF BRASS HINGES MAY BE PLACED SO AS TO STAND IN AN UPRIGHT POSITION AND PARALLEL TO THE TIN PLATE AS SHEWN IN FIG 1 OR THEY MAY BE OPENED AND LAID UPON THE TABLE WHICH SUPPORTS THE INSTRUMENT AS SHEWN IN FIG 2 THE INWARD SURFACES OF THOSE FRAMES FROM THEIR MIDDLE UPWARDS IS COVERED WITH GILT PAPER XY BUT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO COVER THEM WITH TIN PLATES HAMMERED VERY FLAT WHEN THE LATERAL FRAMES STAND STRAIGHT UP THEY DO NOT TOUCH THE TIN PLATE BUT THEY STAND AT ABOUT ONEFIFTH PART OF AN INCH ASUNDER THEY ARE ALSO A LITTLE SHORTER THAN THE TIN PLATE IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT NOT TOUCH THE TIN TUBES AD BC IN THE MIDDLE OF THE UPPER PART OF EACH LATERAL FRAME IS A SMALL FLAT PIECE OF WOOD S AND T WITH A BRASS HOOK THE USE OF WHICH IS TO HOLD UP THE FRAMES WITHOUT THE DANGER OF THEIR FALLING DOWN WHEN NOT REQUIRED AND AT THE SAME TIME IT PREVENTS THEIR COMING NEARER TO THE TIN PLATE THAN THE PROPER LIMIT IT IS EVIDENT THAT WHEN THE INSTRUMENT STANDS AS SHEWN IN FIG 1 THE  OF THE PAPER XY WHICH COVERS THE INSIDE OF THE LATERAL FRAMES STANDS CONTIGUOUS AND PARALLEL TO THE TIN PLATE WHEN258 MR CAVALLOS DESCRIPTION OF A WHEN THE INSTRUMENT IS TO BE USED IT MUST BE PLACED UPON A TABLE A WINDOW OR OTHER CONVENIENT SUPPORT A BOTTLE ELEC TROMETER IS PLACED NEAR IT AND IS CONNECTED BY MEANS OF A WIRE WITH ONE OF THE TIN TUBES AD BC AND BY ANOTHER CONDUCTING COMMUNICATION THE TIN PLATE MUST BE CONNECTED WITH THE ELECTRIFIED SUBSTANCE THE ELECTRICITY OF WHICH IS RE QUIRED TO BE COLLECTED ON THE PLATE ABCD THUS FOR INSTANCE IF IT BE REQUIRED TO COLLECT THE ELECTRICITY OF THE RAIN OR OF THE AIR THE INSTRUMENT BEING PLACED NEAR A WINDOW A LONG WIRE MUST BE PUT WITH ONE EXTREMITY INTO THE APERTURE A OR B OF ONE OF THE TIN TUBES AND WITH THE OTHER EXTREMITY PROJECTING OUT OF THE WINDOW IF IT BE REQUIRED TO COLLECT THE ELECTRICITY PRODUCED BY EVAPORATION A SMALL TIN PAN HAVING A WIRE OR FOOT OF ABOUT SIX INCHES IN LENGTH MUST BE PUT UPON ONE OF THE TIN TUBES SO THAT THE WIRE GOING INTO THE TUBE THE PAN MAY STAND ABOUT TWO OR THREE INCHES ABOVE THE INSTRUMENT A LIGHTED COAL IS THEN PUT INTO THE PAN AND A FEW DROPS OF WA TER POURED UPON IT WILL PRODUCE THE DESIRED EFFECT THUS FAR MAY SUFFICE WITH RESPECT TO THE MECHANICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE INSTRUMENT THE POWER AND USE OF IT WILL BE MADE APPARENT BY THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTS EXP 1 COMMUNICATE TO THE TIN PLATE ABCD A QUANTITY OF ELECTRICITY FOR INSTANCE AS MUCH AS WOULD VERY SENSIBLY AFFECT A COMMON CORKBALL ELECTROMETER THEN IF THE LATERAL FRAMES GHM NOP STAND UPRIGHT AS IN FIG 1 THE ELECTROMETER W WILL SHEW NO DIVERGENCY BUT IF THE FRAMES ARE OPENED AND LET DOWN AS IN FIG 2 THE BALLS OF THE ELECTROMETER W WILL IMMEDIATELY REPEL EACH OTHER AND BY THE APPROACH OF AN EX CITED PIECE OF SEALINGWAX THE QUALITY OF THE ELECTRICITY MAY BE EASILY ASCERTAINED AFTER THE USUAL MANNERPUT UP THE LATERAL FRAMES AGAIN AND THE ELECTRICITY WILL APPARENTLY VANISHLET THEM DOWN AND THE ELECTRICITY WILL REAPPEAR AND SO ON IFNEW ELECTRICAL INSTRUMENT 259 IF YOU TOUCH ANY PART OF THE TIN PLATE OR TIN TUBES WITH YOUR FINGER THE ELECTRICITY IS THEREBY INTIRELY REMOVED AND THAT WILL BE THE CASE WHETHER THE LATERAL FRAMES ARE UP OR DOWN EXP II TAKE AN EXTENDED PIECE OF TINFOIL ABOUT FOUR YARDS SQUARE AND HOLDING IT BY A SILK THREAD ELECTRIFY IT SO WEAKLY AS NOT TO BE CAPABLE OF AFFECTING AN ELECTROMETER THEN BRING IT IN CONTACT WITH THE TIN PLATE OF THE COLLECTOR WHILST THE LATE RAL FRAMES ARE UP THIS DONE REMOVE THE TINFOIL LET DOWN THE LATERAL FRAMES ONE AFTER THE OTHER AND ON DOING THIS THE ELECTROMETER W WILL IMMEDIATELY MANIFEST A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF ELECTRICITY BUT IF THE ELECTROMETER WERE TO SHEW NO SENSI BLE DEGREE OF ELECTRICITY A SMALLER COLLECTOR VIZ ONE HAVING A TIN PLATE OF ABOUT FOUR SQUARE INCHES MUST BE BROUGHT INTO CONTACT WITH THE TIN PLATE OF THE LARGE COLLECTOR WHILST THE LATERAL FRAMES OF THE LATTER ONLY ARE DOWN AND THEN THE SMALL COLLECTOR BEING REMOVED FROM THE LARGE ONE ITS LATERAL FRAMES ARE OPENED AND ITS TIN PLATE IS PRESENTED TO AN ELECTRO METER WHICH WILL THEREBY BE ELECTRIFIED TO A MUCH GREATER DE GREE THAN THE ELECTROMETER W WAS BY THE LARGE COLLECTOR EXP III LET A COMMON CORKBALL ELECTROMETER BE FASTENED TO AN INSULATED CONDUCTOR HAVING ABOUT TWO OR THREE SQUARE FEET OF SURFACE AND COMMUNICATE TO IT SUCH A QUANTITY OF ELECTRICITY AS MAY BE SUFFICIENT TO LET THE BALLS OF THE ELECTROMETER STAND AT ABOUT ONE INCH ASUNDER IN THIS STATE BRING THE CONDUCTOR IN CONTACT WITH THE TIN PLATE OF THE COLLECTOR FOR A VERY SHORT TIME AND IT WILL BE FOUND THAT THE BALLS OF ITS ELECTROMETER WILL IM MEDIATELY APPROACH AND TOUCH EACH OTHER SHEWING THAT THE ELECTRICITY OF THE CONDUCTOR IS GONE TO THE PLATE OF THE COL LECTOR AND IN FACT IF YOU LET DOWN THE LATERAL FRAMES THE BALLS OF THE ELECTROMETER W WILL IMMEDIATELY REPEL EACH OTHER TO A VERY GREAT DEGREE V O L LXXVIII N N IT260 MR CAVALLOS DESCRIPTION C IT SEEMS THEREFORE TO BE CLEARLY SHEWN BY THESE EXPERI MENTS THAT THE TIN PLATE OF THIS INSTRUMENT CAN COLLECT AND RE TAIN A VAST QUANTITY OF ELECTRICITY WHEN THE CONDUCTING SURFACES OF THE LATERAL FRAMES ARE CONTIGUOUS TO IT IN COMPARISON TO THAT QUANTITY WHICH IT CAN EITHER COLLECT OR RETAIN WHEN THOSE SUR FACES ARE REMOVED FROM ITS VICINITY THE QUANTITY OF ELECTRICITY WHICH THE TIN PLATE ABCD IS CAPABLE OF COLLECTING PRINCIPALLY DEPENDS ON THREE CIRCUM STANCES VIZ 1ST ON THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TIN PLATE AND THE CONDUCTING LATERAL SURFACES THE SMALLER THAT DISTANCE IS THE GREATER BEING THE COLLECTING POWER 2DLY ON THE SIZE OF THE INSTRUMENT AND 3DLY ON THE QUANTITY OF ELECTRICITY POS SESSED BY THE BODY FROM WHICH IT MUST BE COLLECTED OR TAKEN AWAY I NEED NOT EXPATIATE ON THE PRINCIPLE UPON WHICH THE ACTION OF THIS INSTRUMENT DEPENDS THIS BEING THE SAME AS THAT OF THE ELECTROPHORUS OF M VOLTAS CONDENSER AND OF MANY OTHER ELECTRICAL EXPERIMENTS NAMELY THAT A BODY HAS A MUCH GREATER CAPACITY FOR HOLDING ELECTRICITY WHEN ITS SURFACE IS CONTIGUOUS TO A CONDUCTOR WHICH CAN EASILY ACQUIRE THE CONTRARY ELECTRICITY THAN WHEN IT STANDS NOT IN THAT SITUATION I SHALL LASTLY ADD THAT HAVING ACTUALLY USED THIS NEW INSTRU MENT IN SEVERAL EXPERIMENTS I HAVE FOUND IT TO ANSWER PERFECTLY WELL ONE OF ITS PRINCIPAL RECOMMENDATIONS BEING THE CER TAINTY OF ITS OPERATION

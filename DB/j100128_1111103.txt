STATES 1917 Though returns from the legislatures are incomplete as yet there is enough to indicate certain general tendencies likely to be expressed in the laws passed to meet the demands of the present war Elaborate acts for the reorganization of the militia in corformity with the require ments of the Hay Army Billl of the Federal Congress have been passed in several states2 The establishment of a Home Guard3 special con stabulary4 or emergency police5 is a popular way of preparing against internal troubles while statutes empowering the governor to render the United States any assistance within the power of the State and to that end to organize and employ as his judgment shall dictate its resources in men and materials illustrate the need for centrali zation felt in times of crisis Special aid to the Federal government in the form of grants for military purposes7 appropriations for additional pay to soldiers sailors and marines in the service of the United States8 and the taking of a census in two states of men and resources available for use in war9 are also worthy of notice Military training in schools is authorized and encouraged in several juris dictions10 But apart from purely military legislation and the many laws calculated to encourage enlistments by granting special favors tax exemptions etc to honorably discharged soldiers and their

privileges14 to offset the sacri fices involved in leaving civil life there are war emergency statutes of the greatest interest among the state laws of 1917 The war has awakened a tardy enthusiasm for checks on the sale of liquor in some states It has persuaded Massachusetts to suspend strict observ ance of the Lords Day it being no longer unlawful to engage in the cultivation of land and the raising harvesting conserving and transporting of agricultural products on the Sabbathl Vermont has defined as crimes a series of acts ranging from making or having in ones possession maps drawings or descriptions of forts arsenals telegraph or telephone lines wireless stations etc to poisoning the water supply or conspiring to blow up public buildings the severest penalties to be visited on the guilty7 Minnesota in a law difficult co reconcile with American ideals of freedom of speech and of the press but of a sort only too common in warcrazed countries makes it unlawful to advocate or teach that men should not enlist in the military or naval forces or that the State should not aid or assist the United States in prosecuting or carrying on war with the public enemies of the United States8 On one branch of war emergency legislation the friends of social reform will look with alarm It has been developed in response to an appeal by the Council of National Defense that the several legis latures delegate to the governors of their respective States the power to suspend or modify restrictions contained in their labor laws when such suspension or modification shall be requested by the Council of National Defense    for a specified period and not longer than the duration of the war9 Vermont has responded by enacting that the commissioner of industries may with the approval of the governor suspend the operation of the laws of this State relating to the hours of employment of women and children while the United States is at uSee e g Pub Acts Conn 1917 c 28 funeral expenses Pub

interfere with the successful prose cution of the present war or be opposed to public welfare and neces sity has passed the legislature and is awaiting gubernatorial action in New York21 while Pennsylvania has a similar bill pending at present writing22 It is almost unnecessary to point to the grave danger lurk ing in such statutes vesting as they do unprecedented and unbridled power in the hands of legislative commissions23 and imperilling at one blow the whole structure of social welfare legislation erected to protect alike present and coming generation of Americans There is English precedent24 for these dangerous measures but our emergency is not yet grave enough to justify dispensing with safeguards so essen tial to the normal happiness of our people and the future welfare of the race FEDERAL EMERGENOY WAR LEGISLATIONThe entrance of the United States into the world war has inevitably given rise to a situation which the legislation of peace times is totally inadequate to meet and which therefore demands the enactment of special temporary measures capable of coping with the emergency Aside from the general pro vision of the Federal Penal Code defining treason and seditious con spiracy2 there were few laws existing at the outbreak of the present war which were aimed at offenses against the national defense By federal statutes spying in the army or navy has long been punishable by death3 Furthermore it is a crime punishable by fine or imprison ment or both to injure military or naval works4 or to commit arson on Tnagazines ships or ammunition belonging to the United States5 or to make a sketch of any fort or naval vessel without authority0 In the Pub Acts Vt 1917 No 172 aLegislature of New York Session of 1917 Senate Pr No 2149 Legislature of Pennsylvania Session of 1917 File of House of Repre sentatives No 1637 The power vested in the commission to suspend labor laws opposed to public welfare and necessity and to make rules and regulations prescrib ing conditions under which employment will be permitted in certain in dustries seems a delegation of legislative functions to that body without setting a sufficiently definite standard for their exercise That there must be a standard and that the New York courts have refused to go further than to permit a legislative commission to decide what are reasonable regulations see Village of Saratoga

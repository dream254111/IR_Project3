WILKES USN AND SIR JAMES BROOKE THE President Mr W J Hamilton thus addressed the Meeting  Gentlerllenf You have just heard the announcement that the Council has awarded the Founders Medal to Captain Wilkes of the United States A avy for the zeal and intelligence with which he carried out the scientific exploring expedition intrusted to him by the Government of the United States in the years 18381842 and for the volumes whicll he has published detaiing the narrative of that expedition  It therefore beconles my duty to endeavour to give you some account of the performances of the gallant officer and of the services which he has rendered to the progress of geography It nlust be remembered that this xvas the first expedition ever fitted out by the Government of the United States for scientific purposes Greater difficulties must therefore be supposed to have attended its organiza tion than would have been the case with more experience on the other hand the merit of success is proportionally increased  The expedition left the Hampton Roads on the 17th of August 1838 and its first scientific operation was the establishment of an observatory at Orange Harbour in Terra del Fuego here some of the vessels remained while others were detached to the westward and Captain XVilkes himself proceeded on the 25th of February to the S for the purpose of exploring the SE side of Palmers Land After reaching lat 63D 25 S finding the season too far advanced to make any progress against the ice he turned his ships head to the N and the whole squadron was soon collected at Valparaiso Here another observatory was established A scientific party visited the bank of snow from which the city is supplied on one of the outlying ranges of the Cordilleras the principal heights of which rose nearly4000 feet above them others visited the mines of Chili They then proceeded to the coasts of Peru and thence after a visit to the interior and to the ruins of Pachacamac commenced their explorations in the Patific  The Paumotu group of islands was first visited for the purpose of completing its examination as recolumended by Admiral KrusensternXXlV Capt Wl LKES Fouylders Medal and in tlle hope of settling the disputed point between the two distin guisllecl Entlish and French navigators Captains Beechey and Du perrey as to the geograpllical position of tlle island of AXinerva or Clermont de Tonnerre Captain Wilkes considers the statement of Captain Duperrey the most correct After visiting Tahiti and the Samoan Group reslgecting all of which Captain Wilkes details are full of information he proceeded to Sydney to refit before starting on his Antarctic cruise  On the 26th of December 1839 they left Sydney and first fell in with the ice on the 10th of January 1840 in lat 61 8 S and long 162 32 E and on the l 1th some of the officers were confident they saxv indications of land Captain Wilkes does not rely much on this but on the 16th these appearances became more positiveX and on t1le 19th they listinctly saw land in long 154 30 E lat 66 20 KS Captain AVilkes however only dates the discovery which he clailns for his expedition frozn the land seen on the 16th I mention this the lllore anxiously on this occasion on account of the controversy which has arisen betweell him and Sir James Ross who sailed over the spot where land was supposed to have been seen Oll the llth to tllis however I wish to allude as lightly as possible convinced as I am that both these gallant officers have only been anxious to establish the truth and to advance the cause of science Undoubtedly on the tracing which Captain Wilkes furnished to Sir James Ross the lancl supposed to hax7e beell seen on the 11th of January is sketched in and as a nleasure of precaution it was perhaps prudent in Captain W7Villies so to do it would have been more satisfactory if he could have statetl to Sir James Ross as he has done in his published account on what slight and imperfect evidence its existence in that position was laid dOWIl After continuing his explorations of the Antarctic continent as far to thewestward as long97ECaptainWilkesfinding his provisions s11ort and the season far advanced turned his ships head to the N and quitted these frozen latitudes I cannot take leave of this portion of the narrative of Captain Wilkes without alluding to the high ellcomiums passed on his proceedings by Sir James Ross who observes that  the arduous and persevering exertions of this expedition continued throughout a period of more than six weeks under circum stances of great peril and hardship cannot fail to reflect the highest credit on those engaged in the enterprise and excite the admiration of all who are in the smallest degree acquainted with the laborious anfl clifficult nature of an icy navigation  he adds  that as yet they had not received the reward or approbation they merited  But I cannot dwell longer on the details of this interesting expedi tion They subsequently proceeded to New Zealand thence to the Feejee group of islands where an observatory was established on Ozzaau and many interesting facts ascertained respecting the habits arld manners of the natives alld the geographical features of the group Hence they proceeded to examine the Hawaiian group or Sandwich Islands where we have an interesting account of the ascent of Mauna Loa and the Volcano of Kilauea Thence stretching across to the American continent they surveyed a portion of the coast ofCaPt WILKESBounders Medal xXv California Aain crossing the whole extent of the Patific they visited and examined the Philippine Islands and passing through the Sooloo Archipelago proceeded to Singapore alld finally returned to America touching at the Cape of Good Hope T regret that it is impossible within the limits of this address to do justice to the con tents of the five volumes in which Captain Wilkes has described the progress of the expedition but I trust I have done enough to show that the exertions of Captain Wilkes and the result of the expedition intrusted to him have in every respect been such as to entitle him to the highest mark of distinction which it is in the power of this Society to bestow The President now addressing himself to Mr Baneroft said  AIr BArCROFT In addressing you for the purpose of placing in your hands the medal which has been awarded by the Council of the Royal Geographical Society of London to your distinguished country man Captain Miilkes for the valuable work which he has published under the title of the  United States Exploring Expedition I rejoice in being the organ of expressing to you the sentiments entertained on this side of the Atlatltic of ttle merits of Captain Wilkes This is the second occasion on whicll our medal has been avfarded to one of our rransatlantic brothers and I feel no small gratification in being thus enabled to give to the whole civilized world this additional proof that tlle pursuit of science operates as a powerful inducement in knitting the bonds of friendship still more closely together between the two great nations of the AngloSaxon race May this union long exist and may they in their continued harmony and goodfellowship continue to pOillt out by their enlightened institutions the value of that sound practical common sense for which they are both so preeminently dis tinguished May I request you to convey this medal to Captain Wilkea with the expression of the best wishes of the Royal Geogra phical Society of London for his future prospserity and success The American AIinister replied as follows  Mr PRESIDENT I have the greatest satisfaction in receiving on behalf of Commander Wilkes of the United States Navy the Founders 3Iedal awarded to him by the Royal Geographical Society An Englishman discovered North America and England has made the paths of the wilderness as familiar as accustomed haunts and traced the currents of the ocean almost as carefully as the courses of her rivers To obtain therefore from the body representing English geographical science this most honourable testimonial to the merits of an American expedition is in every way gratefill  Let lne add my tllanks for the affectiollate sords in regard to my country in its relation with your own ivery kindly wish of that nature uttered here has its response beyond the Atlantic and on this occasion I will express the hope that when the remote regions which our navigators have revealed or explored become enlivened by the colonies of civilized man when the great ocean which so long remailleelXXV1 Si r J  B R O O K EPatrorzSs Medal a solitude is rendered social by the peaceful fleets of commerce your countrymen and mine may never meet but in friendssllip cc I shall immediately transmit this medal to Commander AVilkes who graces a patriotic zeal in his profession by the successful cuture of science PATRON S ZIEDALX The President then proceeding observed  It has already been announced that the Council have awarded tile Patrons Gold Medal to Sir James Brooke the Rajah of Sarawak and Governor of Labuan  rhe name of Mr Brooke has been so frequently and honourably brought before the public in the course of the past winter that it is almost unnecessary for me to occupy your time in detailing at any length the motives which have led the Council to make their present award But I should be failing in my duty to this Society to my dis tirlgllished friend and lastly to myself7 were I on the present occasion to omit all mention of the honourable and gallant deeds of our absent associate When a very young man Mr Brooke went to India as a cadet and was distinguished for his gallantry in the Burmese war Being wourlded on that occasionhe left Calcutta for China ill 1830 for the benefit of his health During this voyage he first saw and was struck with the islands of the Asiatic Archipelago Althougil hitherto negleeted and scarcely known Mr Brooke soon became convinced that they offered a splendid field for enterprise and research Henceforth to carry civilization to the Malay races to extend to them the benefits of commerce and to open to us additioleal geographical knowledge became the objects to which he determined to devote his energies and his means Soorl after his return to Calcutta he quitted the Indian service and full of zeal for his contemplated work proceeded to England working his way home before the ulastv in order to acquire a practical knowledge of those duties and of that science to which henceforth he must trust so much  He then became the owner of the Royalist yacht and spent a twelvemonth cruisin in the Mediterranean trying his vessel and training his crexv During this time he prepared a short memoir on the Gulf of Syme not yet surveyed by our Navy and which was published in the eighth volume of our Journal  He sailed from England on his gallant yet hazardous adventure on the 27th of October 1838 and on the I st of August 1839 dropped his anchor of the coast of Borneo near Tanjong Api After vi8itirlg Sarawak exploring some of the riners along the coast and putting hirnself in communication with the Rajah ilVluda Hassim during which time he had become deeply interested in the future fortunes of Sarawak Mr Brooke returned to Singapore and determined on an excursion to Celebes during the probable continuance of the civil war in Borneo To this visit to Celebes we are indebted for much infor mation respecting the geography of the Gulf of Boni a chart of whicll was prepared under the immediate eye of Mr Brooke who has alsoSr J BROOKS Ptronfis SIedat XSil given us for the first time the history of the great independeIlt king doms of this fine islatld whose princes are said to be desirous of forming commercial relations with the Erlglish nation  After his return to Sarawak in August 1840 struck with th miserable condition of a fine country and a flne people DXr Broolie entered into arrangements with the Rajah Muda Hassim which ter minated in the discomfiture of the rebels and finally in the cession of Saraurak to Mr Brooke and of the tsland of Labuan to the British Government For the details of the gallant enterprises by which these measures urere brought about I must refer you to the interesting olumes of Captain Keppel and to those still more recently published in which the full success of Mr Brookes plans has been developed by my gallant friend Captain Mundy  In these will be seen the advantages gained to geographical science by the introduction of civilization and commerce amongst the llialays and Dyaks of Borlleo ilIany of the rivers of that islandS adtnitting our steamers and menofwar far into the heart of the country were survezTed and examined first by Mr Brooke and subsequently by the commanders of the different vessels who were induced to visit the coasts of Borneo either from Mr Brookes representations or in the exercise of duty for the purpose of putting down the lawless system ot piracy and murder which had long prevailed on those inhospitable shores By them the coasts have been still more accurately surveyed and laid down but to Mr now Sir J Brooke will ever remain the credit and the praise of having from his own energies and resources evolved a plan of conduct founded on the most enterprising and phil anthropic views which has led to such a vast increase of our geogra phical knowledge and to the introduction of lawful commerce and enlightened civilization in regions hitherto known only by the kris of the Malay and the atrocious narratives of rapine piracy and murder  Captain MUNDYXIt is with the liveliest satisfaction that I request you to be the means of forwarding this medal to our mutual friend It recalls to my memory those days when myself a traveller on the classic shores of lonia I first became acquainted with yourself and subsequently with Mr Brooke in the Gulf of Smyrna You will not fail to remind Sir J Brooke of the warm interest entertained by the Ioyal Geographical Society for his success and of the pleasure they llave felt in conferring on hirtl this mark of their admiration and esteem Captain Rodney Mundy rising replied  Mr PRESIDEDTI can assure you that I receive with great satisfaction the Patrons Gold Medal which has been awarded by the Council of the Royal Geographical Society to Sir James Brooke and according to your reqllest I will take the earliest opportunity of for varding it to him either at the seat of his own native government in the province of Sarawak or at the seat of the government which he holds under the authority of our Gracious Majesty at the Island of Labuan And now I should wish at once to convey to yon my thanks for the kind and complimentary manner in which you have been  a SXVlll Sir J B ROOIE Patrons Medal pleased to allude to me individually when first we became acquainted on the shores of lonia and also as connected with Sir James Prookes exertions in promoting the extension of geographical knowledge in the Indian Archipelago I also am desirous of expressing how gratified I feel at having been invited to attend here today as the representative of my friend the Rajah of Sarawak on this interesting and important occasion  It was my good fortune to be much associated with that great man during the last two years of his unequalled career in the East it was also my good fortune to be selected by RearAdmiral Sir Thomas Cochrane the CommanderinChief in the Indian Seas to take pos session in the naTne of The Queen of the Island of Labuan over which Sir James Brooke now rules an island which though small and in significant in itsel yet from its position at the mouth of the river on which stands the capital of Borneo Proper from its excellent har bour from the larte vein of coal which it contains in its bosom and from other local circumstances will we may reasonably anticipate ere many years pass over form a valuable commercial establishment in that quarter of the globe From that island as a general centre we may also predict that many expeditions will shortly set forth with the grand object of extending our geographical and geological know ledge of the neighbouring countries and under the guidance of the master mind of its founder and governor we may surely look forward to the happiest results aIld thus by imperceptible advances make ourselves acquainted with much that will be valuable to science in general  Mr President feeling enthusiastically as I do every thing con nected with Sir James Brooke it is difficult for me to resist the temp tation which the opportunity of speaking now offers me of dwelling at some length on the many and great services perforllled by my dis tinguished friend for the benefit of his country and for the advancement of civilization but I feel that it would be out of my province to do more on this occasion than express my admiration of the able and correct statement which you have yourself just given of the general character of Sir James Brookes mission to Celebes and Borneo As connected with the object for which I am here today I may also state that I was engaged with Sir James Brooke in all those extensive oerations which terminated in the total expulsion of the pirate com munities from the NW coast of Borneo and which placed the sea board of that magnificellt island in a state of security the practical result of which has been that on the same ground where only two years since that zealous officer Sir Edward Belcher met with every obstacle and l1vas obliged to hurry from station to station at the risk of the loss of his instruments and even of his life there is now not only no opposition from the natives but even a desire to afford every assistance to the oMcer employed on surveying duty in that quarter  It now only remains for me to add that in frequent conversations held with Sir James Brooke I have ever heard him express himself in terms of warmth and anxiety for the extension of geographical know ledge in the Indian Archipelago indeed with the exception of theSir J BROOKE Patroz s lIedal XN1X two leading and animating passiolls of his mind if I may so express myself namely the gradual civilization of our semibarbarolls brethren in those seas and the opening of a new field for the commercial enter prise of his own great country the progress of geographical discovery has been one of the grand ideas which occupied him from the com mencement of his hazardous voyage and which he cherished with the same enthtlsiasm which has marked every other act of his extraordinary life  You will then MIr President easily comprehend how gratified Sir James Brooke will be when he receives this testimony of the feelints of this distinguished Society towards him He will I am assured receive this valuable token of the estimation in which his services han7e been held by this Society with every sentiment of gratitude It will le a proof to him that although his labours have been carried on at the distance of half the globe those labours on behalf of science have not been in vain he will know that the eye of a small but scien tific body of his fellowcountrymen has been anxiously watching his proceedings through the many years of his voluntary exile alld at the proper time and season have offered to him the greatest reward it is in their power to bestow  This gift will indeed be an earnest and still further encourage ment to Sir James Brooke to continue those services so long as Provi dence continues to him the blessing of health and the Patrons Gold Medal will I am satisfied ever rertlain in his family as a memorial of the honour now conferred on him by the Council of the Royal Geo graphical Society

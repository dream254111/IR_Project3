FIG9 D DFIG9 FIG10 FIG11 FIG12 FIG13 FIG8 J MYNDE SOXXVII A DESCRIPTION OF NEEDLES MADE FOR OPERATIONS ON THE EYES AND OF SOME INSTRU MENTS FOR THE EARS BY THE SAME T H E FIRST DIFFERS FROM A COMMON COUCHING NEEDLE T A B VII FIG 3 IN THIS THAT IT IS MADE OF TWO PIECES OF STEEL SOLDERED TOGETHER AND FIXED IN A HANDLE FIG 4 AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM THE HANDLE THEY SEPARATE AND HAVE IN EACH LAMINA A BUTTON FIXED WHICH PASSES THROUGH A HOLE IN THE OTHER FROM THIS PART TO THE POINTS THEY ARE SO NICELY APPLIED AND POLISHED TOGETHER THAT THEY CUT AND HAVE THE SHAPE OF A COMMON NEEDLE UPON PRESSING THE BUTTONS THE POINTS ARE SEPARATED AND IN THE INSIDE OF THE BROAD PART OF THE POINTS ARE SEVERAL SMALL INDENTS TO PREVENT ANY THING FROM SLIPPING AFTER IT HAS ONCE GOT HOLD THE USE OF THIS NEEDLE IS EITHER TO DEPRESS A CA TARACT OR IF IT SHOULD BE FOUND OF SUCH A NATURE AS TO BEAR TO BE TAKEN HOLD OF THEN BY OPENING THE POINTS TO ENGAGE IT AND CAREFULLY BRING IT OUT OF THE EYE IF IT SHOULD HAPPEN THAT IN DEPRESSING THE CATARACT OR IN BRINGING IT OUT OF THE EYE SOME OF THE SMALL VESSELS ARE WOUNDED AND SOME DROPS OF BLOOD DIFFUSE THEMSELVES IN THE AQUEOUS HUMOUR THIS SECOND NEEDLE FIG 5 IS MADE WITH DESIGN TO REMEDY THIS INCONVENIENCY IT848 IT IS A LONG SMALL  STILET FIG 6 GRADUALLY DECREASING FROM THE HANDLE TO THE POINT AND IS FITTED TO A LONG SILVER TUBE OF THE SAME SHAPE FIG 7 INTO WHICH THE NEEDLE IS PUT AND THE POINT COMES OUT AT THE END ONE QUARTER OF AN INCH THIS IS TO BE INTRODUCED INTO THE EYE AT THE ORIFICE THE OTHER NEEDLE HAD MADE WHEN IT IS SO FAR INTRODUCED AS THE END OF THE TUBE IS WITHIN THE POSTERIOR CHAMBER OF THE AQUEOUS HUMOUR THE NEEDLE IS TO BE WITH DRAWN LEAVING THE TUBE IN THE EYE AND THEN WITH THE MOUTH MAY BE SUCKED INTO THE TUBE ALL THE BLOOD AND WATERY HUMOUR THAT IS CONTAINED THERE OR ANY OTHER FLOATING PARTICLES THEN THE TUBE IS TO BE WITHDRAWN AND THE EYE LEFT TO REPLENISH ITSELF WITH THE AQUEOUS HUMOUR AGAIN WHICH WILL TAKE TWELVE OR EIGHTEEN HOURS AT MOST THE FOLLOWING INSTRUMENTS ARE PROPOSED TO REMEDY SOME KINDS OF DEAFNESS PROCEEDING FROM OB STRUCTIONS IN THE EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL AUDITORY PASSAGES IN ORDER TO DISCOVER WITH MORE EXACTNESS WHETHER THE DISORDER LIES IN THE OUTWARD EAR I MAKE USE OF A CONVEX GLASS THREE INCHES IN DIAMETER FIXED IN A HANDLE TAB VII FIG 8 INTO WHICH IS LODGED SOME WAX CANDLE WHICH COMES OUT AT A HOLE NEAR THE GLASS AND REACHES TO THE CENTRE WHICH WHEN LIGHTED WILL DART THE COLLECTED RAYS OF LIGHT INTO THE BOTTOM OF THE EAR OR TO THE BOTTOM OF ANY CAVITY THAT CAN BE BROUGHT INTO A STRAIT LINE THEREFORE WHEN IT IS DISCOVERED BY THE HELP OF THIS GLASS AND LIGHTED CANDLE THAT THE EAR IS FULL OF HARD WAX WHICH WILL NOT849 NOT BEAR TO BE TAKEN OUT WITH THE FORCEPS THE METHOD IS TO HAVE A SMALL BOILER WHEREIN ARE PUT SOME PRO PER HERBS AND BY DIFFERENT TUBES OF VARIOUS SIZES THE STEAM IS CONVEYED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE EAR IN A SHORT TIME THE WAX WILL DISSOLVE AND THE PERSON FIND GREAT EASE IN ONE OF THESE TUBES ARE PLACED TWO VALVES TO REGULATE THE HEAT TO THE PERSONS INCLINA TION IF THIS HAS NOT THE DESIRED EFFECT AND THE PER SON STILL REMAINS DEAF THE FOLLOWING INSTRUMENTS ARE MADE TO OPEN THE EUSTACHIAN TUBE IF UPON TRIAL IT SHOULD BE FOUND TO BE OBSTRUCTED THE PASSAGE IS TO BE LUBRICATED BY THROWING A LITTLE WARM WATER INTO IT BY A SYRINGE JOINED TO A FLEXIBLE SILVER TUBE WHICH IS INTRODUCED THROUGH THE NOSE INTO THE OVAL OPENING OF THE DUCT AT THE POSTERIOR OPENING OF THE NARES TOWARDS THE ARCH OF THE PALATE THE PIPES OF THE SYRINGE ARE MADE SMALL OF SILVER TO ADMIT OF BENDING THEM AS OCCASION OFFERS AND FOR THE MOST PART RESEMBLE SMALL CATHETERS THEY ARE MOUNTED WITH A SHEEPS URETER FIG 9 THE OTHER END OF WHICH IS FIXED TO AN IVORY PIPE WHICH IS FITTED TO A SYRINGE WHEREBY WARM WATER MAY BE INJECTED OR THEY WILL ADMIT TO BLOW INTO THE EUSTA CHIAN TUBE AND SO FORCE THE AIR INTO THE BARREL OF THE EAR AND DILATE THE TUBE SUFFICIENTLY FOR THE DISCHARGE OF THE EXCREMENTITIOUS MATTER THAT MAY BE LODGED THERE THE PROBES FIG 10 WHICH ARE OF THE SAME SHAPE WITH THE PIPES HAVE SMALL NOTCHES NEAR THE POINTS WHICH TAKE IN SOME OF THE HARDENED AND GLUTINOUS MATTER THAT IS CONTAINED IN THOSE TUBES WHICH IS DISTINGUISHED BY THE FETID SMELL WHEN THE PROBES ARE WITHDRAWN THERE 7850 THERE IS ANOTHER KIND OF DEAFNESS WHICH PROCEEDS FROM A VIOLENT CLAP OF THUNDER NOISE OF A CANNON OR THE LIKE IN THIS CASE IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE POSITION OF THE MEMBRANA TYMPANI IS ALTERED BEING FORCED INWARDS UPON THE SMALL BONES AND SO BECOMES CONCAVE OUTWARDLY IN THIS CASE NO VIBRATION OF SOUNDS WILL BE COMMUNICATED TO THE DRUM UNTIL THE MEMBRANE HAS RECOVERED ITS NATURAL POSITION THE MEANS PROPOSED TO REMEDY THIS DISORDER ARE FIRST IF THE PERSON HEARD VERY WELL BEFORE AND IT BE NOT TOO LONG AFTER THE ACCIDENT HAS HAPPENED TO OBLIGE THE PATIENT TO STOP HIS MOUTH AND NOSE AND FORCE THE AIR THROUGH THE EUSTACHIAN TUBE INTO THE BARREL OF THE EAR BY SEVERAL STRONG IMPULSES WHICH WILL PROBABLY PUSH THE MEMBRANE BACK TO ITS NA TURAL STATE BUT IF BY ANY ACCIDENT THE EXCREMENT IS HARDEND IN THE TUBE OR THE ORIFICE OF IT WHICH OPENS INTO THE BARREL OF THE EAR SHOULD BE STOPPED UP SO AS THAT NO AIR CAN BE FORCED THAT WAY THE SECOND METHOD PROPOSED IS TO INTRODUCE INTO THE MEATUS AUDITORIUS EXTERNUS AN IVORY TUBE FIG 11 AS NEAR TO THE DRUM AS CAN BE DONE AND SO EXACTLY FITTED THAT NO AIR CAN GO IN OR OUT BETWIXT THE SKIN OF THE EXTERNAL MEATUS AND THE TUBE WHEN IT IS THUS FIXED I TAKE THE FURTHER SMALL END IN MY MOUTH AND BY DEGREES DRAW OUT WHAT AIR IS THERE CONTAINED AND I BELIEVE IT WILL ACT LIKE A SUCKER UPON THE MEMBRANE AND DRAW IT BACK TO ITS NATURAL STATE AND THEN THE PERSON WILL HEAR AS BEFORE IF THIS SHOULD FAIL I SHOULD BE APT TO BELIEVE THE VIOLENT SHOCK THIS MEMBRANE HAS SUFFERED MAY HAVE DISLOCATED SOME OF THE SMALL BONES IN WHICH CASE THERE IS SCARCELY ANY REMEDY AND FOR851 FOR THE DISEASES THAT ARE CALLED NERVOUS I MUST LEAVE THEM TO THE LEARNED GENTLEMEN OF THE FACULTY IN THIS IVORY TUBE MAY BE FIXED A BRASS COCK FIG 12 WHICH BEING TURNED WILL HINDER THE RUSH ING IN OF THE AIR WHILE THE PERSON WHO SUCKS TAKES BREATH AND CAN RENEW HIS SUCTION THE FLEXIBLE SILVER TUBE FOR INJECTING THE EUSTACHIAN TUBE MAY BE USED WITHOUT THE SHEEPS URETER BY BEING SCREWED ON TO A SMALL SILVER SYRINGE AS AT FIG 13

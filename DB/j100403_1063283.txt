Right of Way,i243819,RECENT DECISION and his right to control the work while it is in progress except as to results See 26 CYC 1547 The mere fact however that the employee is one who carries on a separate and independent employment does not make him an independent contractor Brackett v Lubke 4 Allen Mass 138 81 Am Dec 694 1862 The fact that the employee furnishes the tools or materials affords but little light on his independence but such fact has in some cases been considered as tending to show independence Harris v McNamara 97 Ala 181 12 So 103 1892 It is well settled however that an em ployee may be a mere servant though he himself furnishes the materials or tools Tiffin v McCornmack 34 Ohio St 638 32 Am Rep 408 1878 Conversely an employee may be independent though the materials are furnished by the employer Emmerson v Fdy 94 Va 60 26 S E 386 1896 The fact that the employee is paid by the job or piece for his work tends to show that he is independent Giacomini v Pacific Lumber Co 5 Cal App 218 89 Pac 1059 1907 But he may be merely a servant though he is paid by the job or piece Tifin v Mc Cormack supra Isnard v Edgar Zinc Co 81 Kan 765 106 Pac 1003 1910 And an employee may be independent though he is to be paid the amount the work and materials cost him with a percentage added for his services Whitney etc Co v ORourke 172 Ill 177 50 N E 242 1898 The decision in the instant case is based largely on Waters v Pioneer Fuel Co 52 Mimn 474 55 N W 52 38 Am St Rep 564 1893 in which it was held that a teamster hired to haul coal in his own wagon for a fuel company occupies the position of a servant when he repre sents the company in all the details of the work assigned to him and is subject to its control as long as his employment continues Under such circumstances it is immaterial that he is paid for his work by the load and not by the day or hour The instant case certainly seems sound For an illuminating note on the subject see 19 Ann Cas 3 RAILROADSTHE FACT THAT ONLY AN EASEMENT OR TERMINABLE FEE MAY BE ACQUIRED BY THE EXERCISE OF EMINENT DOMAIN DOES NOT PRECLUDE A RAILROAD COMPANY FROM PURCHASING A RIGHT OF WAYA railroad corporation was authorized by statute and by its charter to purchase such real estate as its purposes might require The corporation nego iated with the plaintiff for the purchase of a strip of land to be used as a right of way and after threatening plaintiff with condemnation proceed ings plaintiff agreed to sell The deed was in the form of a general warranty deed reciting that all the estate right title interest in a strip of land was conveyed to the grantee railway company its suc cessors and assigns forever The railroad company ceased to use the land as a right of way and conveyed it to defendant Plaintiff brought an action of ejectment to recover the land admitting the execution and delivery of the deed but claiming that the land was conveyed for railroad purposes only and having ceased to be used for such purposes all the estate in the land had reverted to them Held judgment for defendant Radetsky v Jorgensen Colo 202 Pac 175 1921 383384 VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW A railroad company acquiring a right of way by condemnation pro ceedings takes and can take only a terminable fee Nye v Taunton Branch R Co 113 Mass 277 1873 Lithgow v Pearson 25 Colo App 70 135 Pac 759 1913 A right of way may consist either of the fee or merely of a right of passage and use and whether one or the other is meant in any particular instrument must be gathered from the instrument as  whole John T oore Co v Morgans Louisiana etc Co 126 La 840 53 So 22 1910 And where it appears to be the intention of the parties and the deed of conveyance is sufficient for the purpose a fee and not a mere easement will be conveyed Ballard v Louisville  N R Co Ky 5 S W 484 1887 Breckinridge v Delaware L  W R Co N J 33 Atl 800 1895 Thus it has been held that a conveyance of a strip of land to a railroad company in the usual form of a warranty deed vested the com pany with title to the property and not merely a right of way across it Crowell  Connor v Howard Tex Civ App 200 S W 911 1918 And in such a case when the land so conveyed is no longer needed for railroad purposes the company may sell and convey the same Yates v Van De Bogert 56 N Y 526 1874 It would seem therefore that the holding of the instant case is justified from the cases thus far con sidered Many cases however hold that a deed in the form of a general war ranty deed conveying a strip of land to a railroad company for a right of way does not vest an absolute title in the company but a terminable fee and the interest conveyed is limited by the use for which the land is acquired and when that use is abandoned the property will revert to the original owners U S PipeLine Co v Delaware L  W R Co 62 N J Law 254 41 Atl 759 42 L R A 572 1898 Abercrombie v Simmons 71 Kan 538 81 Pac 208 114 Am St Rep 509 1 L R A N S 806 6 Ann Cas 239 1905 Santa Fe etc R Co v Laune Okla 168 Pac 1022 1917 And the fact that the deed contains covenants of warranty or that the right acquired is designated as a fee is not neces sarily controlling East Alabama R Co v Doe 114 U S 340 1885 Abercrombie v Simmons supra Other cases go farther and hold that a grant of a strip of land to a railroad company for a right of way passes only an easement even though the language be appropriate to the granting of a fee Pacific Iron Works v Bryant Lumber  Shingle Mill Co 60 Wash 502 111 Pac 578 1910 Southern R Co v Van Tenn 216 S W 727 1919 Laurel County v Ioward Ky 224 S W 762 1920 Thus there seems to be irreconcilable conflict as to the interest which a railroad company acquires in the land it purchases for a right of way But in many of the cases where a railroad company was held to have acquired an easement or terminable fee and not an estate in fee simple in the land used for a right of way the language of the granting clause in the deed clearly supported the conclusion and are thus distinguish able from the instant case Jones v Van Bochove 103 Mich 98 61 N W 342 1894 and cases there cited This precise question does not seem to have arisen in Virginia

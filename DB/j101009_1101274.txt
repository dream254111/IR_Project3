OF VIRGINIA RICHMOND VASHON  ANOTHER V BARRETT  OTHERSA March 21 1901 1 CHANCERY PLEADING AND PRACTICEAmendmentsDiscretionAfterdis covered evidence The matter of amendments is largely withiln the discretioln of the trial court After a case has beeni decided however it is niot error to refuse to allow an amended bill to be filed wheni it does not appear from such amended bill or otherwise that the new matter set up by it was discov ered after the original bill was filed 2 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS Voluntary conveyancesAcknowledgementRecorda tion The limitation to a suit to avoid an absolute conveyance on the sole ground that it is voluntary is five years from the time the right to avoid it accrues but by the terms of section 2467 of the Code prior to the late amendment Acts 18956 p 285 if the conveyance was recorded within twenty days after due acknowledgment it was as valid as againist creditors as if recorded on the day of acknowledgment 3 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS  Voluntary conveyances  Settlements Thle act of limitation to suits to avoid voluntary conveyances does not cease to run sim ply because no settlement has been had between parties and the exact amount due has not been ascertained 4 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS Voluntary conveyancesFraud The mere fact thiat a creditor does not know that a conveyance made by his debtor is without consideration does not stop the running of the statute of limitations To have that effect such ignorance must proceed from the fraud of the grantee and this should be plainly charged 5 STATUTE OF LIMITATIoNsBurden of proof Voluntary conveyances The bur den of proving that a transfer alleged to be voluntary was made more than five years before the institution of a suit to have it set aside is on the party pleading the statute Appeal from a decree of the Chancery CoLurt of the city of Rich mond pronounced December 9 1899 in a suit in chancery wherein the appellants were the complainants and the appellees were the defendants Reversed in part The opinion states the case James Caskei and Jackson Guy for the appellants Cardwell  Cardwell B T Barrett and WYise  Watkins for the appellees  Reported by M P Burks State Reporter1901 VASHON V BARRETT 37 BUCHANAN J delivered the opinion of the court The object of this suit was to set aside and annul a conveyance of land and a transfei of an insurance policy made by George S Vashon Sr upon the ground that they were not made for a valuable considera tion and were therefore void as to the debt of the complainant George S Vashon Jr The defence relied on was that the conveyance and transfer were made more than five years prior to the institution of the suit Upon the bearing of the cause at the June term 1899 upon the bill plea of the statute of limitations and general replication thereto the court sus tained the plea and ordered the bill to be disrmissed The order was not actually entered however at that term of the court but was entered in December following as a nurne pro tune order On the day that order was entered Samuel H Pulliam tendered his petition to the court in which he alleged that the complainant had on the 6th day of October 1899 for a valuable consideration assigned him the debt sued on and prayed that he might be made a party complainant in the cause with his assignor or be substituted in his stead as sole com plainant in order that he might file an amended and supplemental bill which was tendered to the court in which it was alleged by way of amenidment to the original bill that he was informed and believed and so charged that the conveyance and transfer sought to be set aside by the original bill as voluntary were in fact fraudulent and that they were made to hinder delay and defraud the creditors of George S Vashon Sr but the court was of opinion that the petitioner was a pendente lite purchaser and not entitled to be nmade a party com plainlant in the cause and was further of opinion that the amended and supplemental bill ought not to be filed because it made out a new case because it did not appear on its face or otherwise that the facts therein stated upon which the charge of fraud was based were dis covered after the filing of the original bill and for the further reason that the court had decided to dismiss the original bill at the last term of the court From that decree the complainant in the original bill and Pulliam his assignee obtained this appeal The refusal of the court to allow the amended and supplemental bill to be filed is assigned as error The question of filing amended pleadings after the court has decided a catse was considered in the recent cause of Alsop v Catlett 97 Va 364 37038 7 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER May In that case it was said After the case had been heard and decided by the Circuit Court and a decree directed dismnissing the bill the com plainants tendered an amended bill which the court refused to allow to be filed This is assigned as error The object sought by the amended bill was to set up additional facts which had come to the knowledge of the complainants since the original bill was filed These afterdiscovered matters had been known to the complainants for months before the case was decided or submitted and no reason is given why the amended bill was not tendered earlier The matter of amendments is largely in the discretion of the court Where the com plainant hias knowledge of the afterdiscovered matters before the case is heard and delays offering an amended bill setting up such matters until after the case is decided against him on the merits it cannot be said that the court abused its discretion in refusing to allow the amended bill to be filed In this case it does not appear from the amended bill or otherwise that the facts upon which the charge of fraud was based were dis covered after the original bill was filed No excuse whatever is given why the charge of fraud was not made before the case was decided As this delay unexplained justified the courts refusal to allow the amended bill to be filed it is unnecessary to consider the other grounds upon which it based its action Under what circumstances if at all a pendente lite purchaser in a case like this is entitled to become a party complainant need not be considered as no injury resulted to such purchaser in this case for if he had become a party the action of the court in refusing to allow the amended bill to be filed would have been the same for he certainly had no higher rights than his assignor By sectioni 2929 of the Code it is provided among other things that no gift conveyance assignment transfer or charge which is not on consideration deemed valuable in law shall be avoided either in whole or in part for that cause oinly unless within five years after the right to avoid the same has accrued suit be brought for that purpose   The complainants debt arose out of a partnership business in which he and his father were engaged and which was dissolved February 1 1893 The conveyance sought to be set aside was dated March 9 acknowledged March 24 and admitted to record April 12 1894 This suit was not instituted until April 7 1899 more than five years after the conveyance in question was made and recorded for by section 2467 of the Code the law then in force it was expressly provided that1901 VASHON V BARRETT 39 where a deed conveying real estate is admitted to record within twenty days from its being acknowledged before and certified by an officer authorized to certify the same for record as was done in this case unless it be a mortgage or deed of trust not in consideration of mar riage the recordation shall be as valid as to creditors and subsequent purchasers as if such admission to record had been on the day of such acknowledgment and certificate It thus appears that the complainants debt was contracted before the conveyance was made although no settlement or at least no final settlement of their partnership matters was had until some months afterwards The fact that no settlement had been made and the precise amount due the complainant had not been ascertained did not we think postpone the running of the statute until a settlement was made The complainant had the right even if his debt had not been due and payable when the conveyance was recorded to bring his suit to avoid it section 2460 of the Code as amended Pollards Supplement page 264 and surely where it was due although a settlement was necessary to ascertain the precise amount he had the right to institute his suit to avoid the conveyance as so n at least as it was recorded To hold that the statute of limi tations would not commence to run until a settdement had been made would make the grantees right depend upon the acts of the grantor and the creditor who might indefinitely delay their settlement and thus defeat the very object of limiting the right to avoid the deed to five years after the right to sue had accrued See note of Judge Burks in 1 Va Law Register 596 1 Bartons Chy Pr 112 The mere fact that the complainant did not know as he alleges that the conveyance was without consideration until the year 1897 eanc reoel thAe bar of the Rtqtliti of limitations To have that effect such ignorance nusst proceed frorn the fraud A tlhe grantee and this should be plainly charged in the pleadings Fiosier v Bison 17 Gratt 322 345 Bicklev Chrisman 76 Va 678 686 There is no such charge in the complainants bill We are of opinion therefore that the right to avoid the conveyance in question accrued as soon at least as the deed was recorded and this suit not having been instituted within five years from that time the comnplainants right to have the deed corrected was barred by the statute The record does not show when the transfer of the insurance policy sought to be set aside was made The bill avers that it was after the complainants debt was contracted The burden of showing that the40 7 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER May transfer was more than five years before the institution of this suit was upon the party pleading the statute Goodell v Gibbons 91 Va 608 Having failed to show this we are of opinion that the Chancery Court erred in sustaining the plea of the statute of limitations and dis missing the bill as to the transfer and to that extent the decree appealed from must be reversed but in all other respects affirmed and the cause remanded to the Chancery Court for further proceedings Affirmed in part NOTE The court adopts in this case the conclusion reached by Judge Burks in 1 Va Law Reg 597 that the five years period of limitation prescribed for suits to set aside voluntary conveyances runs not from maturity of the plaintiffs claim but from the time he might first have brought his suit as he may by amendment of 18934 p 614 sue before his claim is due the statute begins to run as soon as the voluntary conveyance is madeor as intimated in the principal case and in accordance with a familiar principle of equityif there be fraudulent concealment of thetransfer then from the time of its discovery by the creditor

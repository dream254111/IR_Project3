because contrary to the law and the evidence The deceased it appears moved to the house where he died about Christmas preceding the occurrence resulting in the wound inflicted by plaintiff in error upon him which was followed by his death and according to evidence in the record unobjected to from the time he went there he began to behave very badly towards plaintiff in error and his two daughters who lived near him growing out of the refusal of plaintiff in error to allow hunting on his lands Plaintiff in error lived upon his own land with his two daughters aged 16 and 17 years respectively whose mother died when they were about 12 years younger since which time he had had the entire care of these girls carrying them about with him until they became large enough for one to remain at home while the other went with him to work when he went to the fields Deceased on numerous occasions and when ever opportunity was afforded not only used abusive language to plaintiff in error in the presence of his daughters but behaved in the presence of the latter when alone and unprotected in the most indecent and shocking manner using language too vile and indecent to be here repeated There was evidence tending to show that on the morning of the day of the homicide plaintiff in error left his home accompanied by one of his daughters each riding a horse to go to his mountainland one mile up South river where he and his daughter had seen a ground hog the day before and for the purpose of killing it carried his doublebarrel gun loaded with large shot that when they reached the turn of the road at which the deceaseds house situated several hundred yards off could be seen they observed him standing in the door where he remained until they got opposite his house when he came down to the railroad and disappeared behind a sycamore and other trees in foliage at the time after which plaintiff in er ror and his daughter neither thought nor saw anything more of the deceased until about 100 yards further on when they turned back at an acute angle into plaintiff in errors right of way lead ing across the railroad up to his mountain land at which time they saw the deceased looking mad step off the railroad down towards them muttering something which could not be under stood because of the roar of the river and thereupon plaintiff in error told the deceased to go away and not give him any trouble that deceased then cursed plaintiff in error and told him he had to take it that he had it in for him and threw a rock which came close to plaintiff in errors head and came on quickly throwing another rock which also nearly struck him which rocks deceased took from his pockets or from under his overall 3 513 1912 18 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER the railroad and picked up another large rock and started to rise with his left hand extended towards the latch of the gate saying Damn you I will come through and kill you this morn ing  whereupon plaintiff in error lowered his gun and shot one barrel of it through the gate at deceaseds legs the shot taking effect in his right leg between the knee and the body Plaintiff in error fired but one barrel of his gun and the deceased after standing a moment dropped the rock from his hand and walked back towards his home and when about 75 yards or about half the distance to his house laid down by the railroad track from which point he was later carried to his home where he died about 7 oclock that evening The court is of opinion that the dying declarations of the de ceased allowed to go to the jury at the trial over the objection of plaintiff in error were improperly admitted in evidence 1 be cause it was not clearly shown that the deceased believed he was going to die when these declarations were made and 2 even if the deceased had believed he was going to die at the time he made the declarations narrated by the witness Painter some of the statements said to have been made by the deceased were not a part of the res gestae nor did they relate to the transaction it self which resulted in the declarants death 1 The commonwealth introduced one B D Armstrong as a witness who testified over objection by plaintiff in error that he was a brakeman on the train of the Norfolk  Western Rail way Company which came along about 725 oclock a m on the morning that deceased was shot and saw him by the railroad his wife and children and one Gerald being with him and he asked witness to help him up and upon witness doing so pre sumably deceased said Lay me down and let me die This was nothing more than a simple exclamation on the part of the deceased actuated doubtless by the sensation of pain and suf fering at the time in his wounded leg but in no wise proves that he thought he was going to die and threw no light whatever as we shall presently see on his franme of mind five or six hours after when the socalled dying declarations under considera tion were made The witness Painter a brotherinlaw of deceased alone testi fies as to the dying declarations of the deceased admitted in evi dence and as far as pertinent his statement is After I got my dinner I went back to Campbells and stayed there until about 2 oclock when I went to Vesuvius and when I got back later in the evening Campbell was dying When I got back to Campbells about 2 oclock after arresting Patterson I told him what Patterson said about him throwing the rocks and  Nov 514PATTERSON V COMMONWEALTH Campbell said that there had been no trouble between him and Patterson and he asked me whether Patterson said that he had thrown any rocks Says he Did he say that and Campbell then said that he had been telling him Painter all day that he was going to die and that he never had any trouble with Patterson only at the spring on the mountain and that Patterson said that he had eight feet of his land and must put the fence back and that Patterson ripped out an oath and refused to speak to him Campbell said there had been no trouble between them and that Patterson shot and killed him for nothing that Patterson said God damn you dont come through my gate or I will blow your brains out And Campbell said that he hoped he would die that minute if he threw a rock that whether Pattersons nerve failed him or not he did not know but that he dropped the gun from his head and shot him in the leg When I went back after the arrest he was resting not suffering much but said I am poorly that he never had mistreated Pattersons daughtersrespected them as his own On crossexamination the witness said that when Campbell made the above statement to him he took a glass of water without assistance and in drinking it choked that he then assisted him to take some medicine that the doctor had left there and with witness help Campbell took the medicine and did not choke and took it easily and without trouble that when witness asked him about taking the medicine Campbell said that he did not reckon it would do him any good but that he would take it and he did take it that Campbell made no arrangements about dying either about his worldly affairs or about his soul that he asked nobody to have prayers or read the Bible and did not ask for the preacher that he heard Campbell talking about not wanting to go to the Buena Vista hospital but wanted to go to Roanoke but he did not say for what reason that Campbell told nobody goodbye and that witness shortly after hearing the above conversation went up to Vesuvius and when he got back later in the evening had no further conversation with Camp bell and Campbell said nothing to any one and died about 7 oclock The attending physician upon reaching the deceased found him suffering from great loss of blood and he deceased said that if something was not lone to relieve his pain he would die This physician further testified that the bleeding had stopped when I reached Campbell I relieved his pain He said he was easier It further appears from the testimony of this witness that when he left deceased shortly before his alleged conversa tion with the witness Painter not only was the hope of life held out but without any suggestion of death he suggested to deceased that he would take him to the Buena Vista hospital but the de 1912  51518 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER ceased said that he wanted to go to the hospital at Roanoke The physician never told deceased or any one else that he deceased was going to die but did say to some that his chances were poor or not good True he says also that when he reached the de ceased he knew that if something was not done to relieve his pain he would die but he says also as we have just stated that when he reached deceased the bleeding had stopped and he relieved his pain and talked with him about going to the hospital and he stated that he wanted to go to Roanoke and not to Buena Vista Another significant fact appearing in the record going to show the absence of thought on the part of the deceased or those around him that he was under a sense of impending death and without any expectation or hope of recovery is that his wife knowing little or nothing about the matter went to the prelimi nary hearing given the plaintiff in error by a justice several miles from their home on the day deceased was shot and was gone several hours It is very true that in ascertaining consciousness of approach ing death recourse should naturally be had to all the attending circumstances such as the nature of the injury etc but in this case neither the nature of the injury nor the circumstances shown clearly warranted the conclusion that the deceased was conscious of approaching death when he made the statements introduced as his dying declarations It will not do to say that because death did actually occur a few hours after the declara tions were made the conclusion must bereached that the declar ant was conscious of approaching death when theywere made In Jacksons Case 60 Va 667 the deceased appeared impressed with the belief that he would soon die and generally so ex pressed himself and in the preparation for death made his will yet after waking up from a nap of sleep he said Who knows but that I may get well and this was held to imply the existence in his mind of a possibility of his recovery and evidence offered as to dying declarations made by him were not admissible See also Bulls Case 55 Va 620 Swishers Case 67 Va 964 21 Am Dec 330 OBoyles Case 100 Va 785 40 S E 121 Bowles Case 103 Va 815 48 S E 527 In the case of Tip v State 14 Lea Tenn 502 the facts and circumstances relied on as a sufficient foundation for the intro duction in evidence of certain alleged dying declarations of the deceased were strikingly similar to the facts and circumstances relied on in this casebut the court in an opinion reviewing the authorities at some length held that there was not sufficient proof that the deceased was without any hope of recovery and therefore the evidence as to his dying declaration had to be re jected The opinion quotes from Lord Coleridge in Rex v Spill 516  NovPATTERSON V COMMONWEALTH bury 7 C  P L 87 as follows It is an extremely painful matter for me to decide upon but when I consider that this species of proof is an anomaly and contrary to all the rules of evidence and that if received it would have the greatest weight with the jury I think I ought not to receive the evidence un less I feel fully convinced that the deceased was in such state as to render the evidence clearly admissible It appears from the evidence that the deceased said he thought he should not re cover as he was very ill Now people often make use of ex pressions of that kind who have no conviction that their death is near approaching If the deceased in this case had felt that his end was drawing very near and that he had no hope of re covering I should expect him to be saying something of his affairs and of who was to have his property or giving some directions as to his funeral or as to where he would be buried or that he would have used expressions to his widow purporting that they were soon to be separated by death or that he would have taken leave of his friends and relations in a way that showed he was convinced that his death was at hand As noth ing of this sort appears I think there was no sufficient proof that he was without any hope of recovery and that I therefore ought to reject the evidence It follows from the general principle that the belief must be not merely of the possibility of death nor even of its probabil ity but of its certainty A less stringent rule might with safety have been adopted but tlis is the accepted one The tests have been variously phrased there must be no hope of recovery a settled expectation of death an undoubting belief Their gen eral effect is the same The essential idea is that the belief should be a positive and absolute one not limited by doubts or reserve so that no room is left for the operation of worldly mo tives 2 Wigmore on Ev  1440 Among the authorities cited in support of the text is the case of Peak v State 50 N J Law 222 12 Atl 701 in which the opinion by Beasley C J says The declarant shall have a complete conviction that death is at hand    Death shortly to ensue must be an absolute certainty so far as the con sciousness of the person making the declaration is concerned The syllabus of that case so far as pertinent is In order to make dying declarations admissible the state must make it plainly apparent that the declarant had given up all hope of life and be lieved that death was impending Where the surgeon told the patient she might die at any moment and that there was but one chance from a contemplated operation and the patient said she did not expect to recover but would like to and the conditions of the situation did not control such expressions held that the 1912  51718 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER statements of the patient then made were not admissible on the ground that it was not shown that such declarant had given up all hope of life See also 4 Va  W Va Enc Digest p 848 where under the head Foundation for the Admission of the Evidence it is said that the rule as stated in the authorities above cited is a wellsettled rule and all the decisions of this court relating to the subject are cited 2 Dying declarations are only admissible in evidence as to the circumstances of the transaction itself which results in the death of the declarant Clarks Crim Proc 525 9 Am  Eng Enc L 679 OBoyles Case supra The absence of any self serving purpose to be furthered on the part of the declarant is an essential element of the circumstantial guaranty of the trust worthiness of dying declarations 2 Wigmore on Ev  1443 3 The socalled dying declarations of the deceased ad mitted in evidence in this case are obnoxious to the established rules governing the admissibility of such evidence not only be cause they were not confined to the transaction itself which re sulted in the death of the deceased but contained selfserving declarations as to his attitude toward plaintiff in error and his daughters prior to the date of the transaction notably that he deceased had never mistreated Pattersons daughtersre spected them as his own 4 At the trial of the case after the said declarations had been admitted in evidence and after one of the daughters of plaintiff in error had been allowed to testify as to deceaseds conduct toward her her father and her sister and had given an account of his solicitations and attempted assault upon her in the mountain field which fact she straightway communicated to her father counsel for the defense offered to prove by one Aud Davis that the deceased prior to the occurrence had in vile language declared his purpose to do just what the daughter of the deceased testified he had attempted to do but the witness Davis was not allowed to testify to which ruling plaintiff in er ror excepted and assigns error As before stated the declarations of the deceased as to his conduct towards the daughters of the accused were not admissi ble and ought to have been excluded but the trial court having admitted them the accused ought to have been permitted to contradict the said declarations of the accused In the view we take of the case neither the said declarations of the deceased nor the statements which the deceased made to Davis were ad missible and upon the next trial neither should go to the jury We shall not attempt to consider at length the assignment of error relating to ihe instructions given for the commonwealth 518  NovPATTtRSON V COMMONWEALTH and the refusal of instructions asked for the defense in fact it is not necessary 5 The instructions to the jury given for the commonwealth were embraced in one very lengthy and detailed statement of the principles of law applicable to cases of homicide in general and to the evidence in this case in particular and then contain the following paragraph And you are further instructed that even though you may believe from the evidence that the de ceased Saml Campbell had used insulting and threatening language to the accused and had used improper and indecent language to and about the daughters of the accused in their presence and in his presence yet unless you further believe from the evidence and all the immediate circumstances surrounding the killing of deceased that he was the aggressor and that said accused acted in selfdefense with the real or apparent necessity of saving himself from death or great bodily injury you cannot consider such evidence at all in arriving at your verdict The contention of counsel for plaintiff in error is that not only were the instructions given for the commonwealth confusing to the jury and misleading but that the language of the instructions just quoted was not a correct statement of the law as applied to the facts which the evidence in the case tended to prove and was in conflict with an instruction given for the defense in which the court rightly instructed the jury that in considering the ques tion as to whether Campbell made an attack upon Patterson which led to the shooting they might consider the evidence of the state of feeling between Campbell and Patterson preceding same as throwing light upon the situation and occurrences We are of opinion that the principle of law propounded in the instruction for the defense which told the jury that they might consider the evidence of the state of feeling between Campbell and Patterson preceding the shooting as throwing light upon the situation and occurrences was a correct one and therefore the language embraced in the instructions given for the commonwealth quoted above was in conflict therewith and should not have been given As the other questions raised with respect to the instructions are not likely to arise upon another trial of the case they need not be considered here and for the same reason it is not neces sary to consider the assignment of error relating to the refusal of the court to grant the accused a new trial because of after discovered evidence The remaining assignment of error is to the refusal of the court to set aside the verdict of the jury because contrary to the law and the evidence and as the case has to be remanded 1912  51918 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER for a new trial we deem it inexpedient to review the evidence certified in the record It follows that the judgment of the circuit court has to be re versed the verdict of the jury set aside and the case remanded for a new trial to be had not in conflict with the views expressed in this opinion Reversed KEITH P concurring I think the dying declaration which appears in the record was too broad and that so much of it as related to facts not directly connected with the homicide should have been excluded but that subject to proper correction the declaration should have been admitted Whether or not a dying declaration is admissible depends largely upon the mental condition of the declarant If a man who has received a wound believes that wound to be mortal and that he will shortly die of it his declaration is admissible and I know of no way in which his mental attitiude can be ascertained except by what the declarant may say and do In the case under consideration Campbell stated that he was going to die and when offered the medicine said that he did not reckon it would do any good but that he would take it There was no word which emanated from him between the time he received the wound and the moment of his death which cast the slightest doubt upon his sincerity or upon his belief that he was within the shadow of impending death It is true that when the physician spoke to him about sending him to a hospital he said that he preferred to go to the hospital at Roanoke rather than that at Buena Vista but there was nothing that indicated that he entertained the slightest hope of recovery and as a matter of fact he died on the afternoon of the day he received the wound I think the dying declaration was admissible but should have been confined to the facts connected with the homicide and for these reasons I concur in the judgment of reversal but not in the opinion of the court Note The modern tendency of the courts is all towards greater liberality in the admission of evidence especially in criminal cases and as stated in the editorial column of this number Virginia has a splendid record for administering speedy and impartial justice in murder cases In fact we believe that no appellate court in the Republic reverses so small a percentage of criminal cases as our own Su preme Court of Appeals and objections that have not worked sub stantial injustice to the accused never bring about a reversal But in the principal case the court did reverse on two grounds dealing with the admissibility of dying declarations first because a sense of impending death on the part of the deceased was not sufficiently 520  Nov1912  MUSE V GISH 521 shown when he made this declaration second because the declara tions were not confined to the facts connected with the homicide As to this second ground the court was clearly right and Keith P concurred in that part of the majority opinion but as to the first ground of reversal it seems that the court is wrong because as stated in the dissenting opinion a sense of impending death is a mental condition and this mental attitude can be ascertained in no other way than by what the declarant may say or do See 10 Encyc Law 2nd Ed p 387 That the declarations were made under a sense of impending death may be made to appear from what the injured person said or from the nature and extent of the wounds inflicted being obviously such that he must have felt or known that he could not survive as well as from his conduct at the time and the communications if any made to him by his medical advisers if assented to or understand ingly acquiesced in by him Mattox v United States 146 U S 140 151 36 L Ed 917 To our mind the court attached too much weight to the fact that the deceased made no arrangements about dying either as to his worldly affairs or as to his soul that he asked nobody to have prayers or read the Bible and did not ask for a preacher Many explana tions might be offered for this omission and requiring such acts would unduly narrow the channel through which this evidence is ad mitted He repeatedly spoke of dying and this is ordinarily suffi cient While in this particular case the lower court should have been reversed on the second ground yet this ruling is destined to have a perncious influence as a precedent and if strictly adhered to will result in excluding many dying declarations otherwise admissible Let there be liulht is a good general rule of evidence Tn State v Kilgore 70 Mo 553 the court admitted the force of the argument that the silence of the deceased as to his estate or any disposition of it etc was a circumstance showing that he was not conscious that death was impending but it was added that such ar gument is greatly weakened in a case where the accused is seriously or dangerously wounded And as further authority against the ruling of the court that prep aration for the hereafter is material in determining whether the de ceased regarded himself in articulo mortis it has been held that his use of profane language does not render the declarations inadmis sible on the ground that such conduct shows an absence of that feeling of solemnity supposed to be present in case of the belief of impending death the court remarking that it is common knowl edge that persons addicted to the use of curse words use them al most

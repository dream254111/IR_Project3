shall receive the full income WIFE AS WITNESS FOR HUSBANDIn Clarke v State Ala 23 South 671 the defendant was indicted for the murder of his infant child born alive but dying as the result of violence inflicted by the defendant upon the mother his wife during pregnancy The wife was offered as a witness by the accused hus band but the lower court rejected her as incompetent on common law principles On appeal this was held error on the ground that a constituent element of the offence charged being personal violence to the wife she was competent to testify against her husband and therefore for him Says Brickell C J The gravamen an indispensable constituent of the offense charged in the in dictment is the unlawful beating of the mother while pregnant causing the death of the child after birth Though not alleged in the indictment the fact was shown by the evidence that she was at and prior to the beating the wife of the defendant and the next question for consideration is her competency as a witness for the defendant In relation to the competency of husband and wife as wit nesses for or against each other in criminal cases or proceedings we have no statute which changes or modifies the common law By the common law in all cases of personal injuries committed by husband or wife against each other the injured party is an admissible witness against the other 1 Greenl Ev sec 343 1 Bish

originally grew out of a supposed necessity of the protection of the wife against personal violence threatened or actual by the hus band Whatever may have been the origin of the exception it is now

the husband and another for using an instrument with intent to procure the miscarriage of the wife while pregnant and is not in reason or principle distinguishable from the present case Wherever the element of personal violence is a necessary constituent of the offense every reason exists upon which the exception rested originally and for the sake of public justice the wife should be admitted as

taining a provision that it is not to take effect until the grantors death is testa mentary in its character and is a will rather than a deed Before marriage the grantor conveyed certain lands to his grandson by deed with warranty of title The deed was delivered and recorded It contained the provision that this deed is to take effect and be in fill force from and after my death The grantor sub sequently married Upon his death his widow claimed dower in the lands men tioned in the deed and his heirs the feesimple It was held that the widow was entitled to dower and that the remainder passed not to the grantee but to the grantors heirs at lawthe latter presumably on the ground that the marriage revoked the testamentary paper or that it was not executed with the necessary formality to operate as a will We say presumably since the court does not assign reasons for its ruling on this point  We are satisfied says the court  that the instrument was not effective as a deed It did not purport to be effective as a conveyance until the death of Cal vin Pinkham so that the absolute legal title to the premises were in him at the time of his death A deed must pass a present interest in the property even though the right of possession and enjoyment may not accrue until some future period A will passes no title until after the testators death and this marks the essential difference between a deed and a will The great weight of authority sustains the proposition that an instrument in the form of a deed which takes effect and becomes operative alone upon the death of the maker is testamentary in character and is not a deed Devl Deeds sec 309 Haberglham v Vincent 2 Ves Jr 204 Bigley v Souvey 45 Mich 370 8 N W 98 Singleton v Bre7malr 4 McCord 12 Courad v Bell Minn 61 N W 673

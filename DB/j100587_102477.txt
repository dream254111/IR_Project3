PAPER OF MINE WAS READ BE FORE OUR PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY HERE IN DUBLIN AND AFTER PUBLISHD IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS NUMB 202 WHEREIN I GAVE AN ACCOUNT OF A STONE OF AN EX TRAORDINARY BIGNELS SPONTANEOUSLY VOIDED THROUGH THE UTHERA BY A WOMAN HERE IN DUBLIN AND AS A COROL LARY OR DEDUCTION FROM THIS HISTORY I THERE PROPOSED THE EXTRACTION OF THE STONE BY THE GRADUAL DILATATION OF THE URETHRA OR NECK OF THE BLADDER WITHOUT ANY MANNER OF SECTION AS THE MOST SAFE AND EASY WAY AND OF MOST GENERAL USE FOR THE FREEING THOSE OF THE FEMALE SEX FROM THE STONE IN THE BLADDER INFERREDIINFERRED12 I THEN ALLEDGED TWO INSTANCES OF FACT TO PROVE NOT ONLY THE REASONABLENESS BUT THE REAL SUCCESS OF THIS PRA CTISE AND I HAVE BEEN SINCE STILL MORE CONFIRMED IN THAT OPINION BY SEVERAL OTHER SUCCESFUL OPERATIONS I HAVE SEEN OF THE LIKE KIND BUT MORE PARTICULARLY BY ONE LATELY PERFORMED IN THIS TOWN ON A GIRL BETWEEN ELEVEN AND TWELVE YEARS OLD ONE SARAH JONES THAT FOR SIX YEARS PAST HAS BEEN SEVERELY AFFLICTED WITH ALL THE PAINFUL AND UNUSUAL SYMPTOMS OF THE STONE BUT ON THE 16TH OF OCTOBER WAS HAPPILY RELIEVED BY ONLY DILATING GENTLY THE NECK OF THE BLADDER AND THEN EXTRACTING A STONE OF A VERY CONSIDERABLE BULK WITHOUT MAKING ANY INCI SION AT ALL THE WHOLE OPERATION WAS PERFORMED IN SIX OR SEVEN MINUTES AND WAS THE MORE REMARKABLE ON THE ACCOUNT OF THE EXTRAORDINARY LARGE SIZE OF THE STONE WHOSE SHAPE AND BIGNESS IS EXACTLY REPRESENTED IN THE ANNEXT FIGURE VID TAB FIG 1 I DID OMIT TAKING THE WEIGHT OF IT NOR WAS IT TRULY ANY GREAT NEGLECT SINCE I THINK IT NO VERY MATERIAL CIRCUMSTANCE FOR OUR INFORMATION IN IN SUCH CASES TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT A STONE WEIGHS FOR THE GREATER OR LESS GRAVITY OF THESE BODIES DEPEND NOT ON THEIR OUTWARD DIMENSIONS SO MUCH AS ON THEIR INTERNAL PARTS ACCIDENTALLY COHERING MORE OR LESS COM PACTLY TOGETHER AS THEY ARE FORMED IN THE BLADDER AND AS IF NO IMPORTANCE IN THE OPERATION OF EXTRACTING THEM THE DIFFICULTY OR EASINESS OF WHICH AS WELL AS THE DANGER AND SUCCESS MORE IMMEDIATELY DEPEND ON THE MAGNI TUDE AND SHAPE OF THE STONE RATHER THAN ON ITS GRAVI TY SO THAT IF WE HAVE A RIGHT IDEA OF THOSE TIS ALTOGE THER SUFFICIENT TO OUR PURPOSE BY THE SIZE OF THIS WE HAVE HERE FIGURED IT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN SO BIG THAT IT MAY SEEM ALMOST INCREDIBLE A SOLID OF THAT BULK SHOULD BE FORCED THROUGH THE U RETHRA OF SO SMALL AND SO YOUNG A CHILD WITHONT ANY MANNER13 MANNER OF SECTION AND THAT THE CHILD SHOULD RECOVER SO AS TO BE PERFECTLY WELL WITHOUT THE LEAST ILL ACCIDENT SUCCEEDING THE OPERATION BUT WE MAY GATHER HENCE OF WHAT VAST EXTENTION THIS URINARY PASSAGE THOUGH NATURALLY STRAIT IS CAPABLE AND HOW MUCH STILL WIDER IT MAY BE DILATED WHERE TIS PROPORTIONABLY LARGER I MEAN OF THOSE OF THIS SEX OF RIPER YEARS OR GROWN UP TO WOMENS ESTATE WHO MAY YET MORE EASILY AND SAFELY BE RELIEVED AFTER THIS SAME MANNER EVEN OF STONES OF A MUCH LARGER SIZE THAN THIS WE HERE SPEAK OF THE FRENCH A NATION CERTAINLY VERY SUBJECTTO THE STONE IN THE BLADDER AND WHOSE CHIRURGEONS THEREFORE MUST OF NECESSITY BE VERY CONVERSANT WITH THIS DISEASE AND EXPERT IN THE OPERATIONS REQUISITE FOR THE CURE OF IT HAVE I SEE LATELY ESTABLISHED THIS SORT OF PRACTICE THO I MUST NEEDS OWN I DID NOT KNOW SO MUCH TILL I HAD PERUSED A VERY USEFUL BOOK OF CHIRURGERY PUBLISHED BUT THIS LAST YEAR 1696 AT PARIS IN 8VO BY MONSIEUR DE LA VAUGUION ENTITULED TRAITE COMPLET DES OPERATIONS DE CHIRURGIE WHERE I FIND IN HIS THIRTEENTH CHAPTER THAT TREATS OF THE STONE IN THE BLADDER AND DESCRIBES THE WAY OF EXTRACTING IT OUT OF WOMEN HE HAS THESE WORDS ON DILATE LURETRE AVEC LE DILATATEUR SANS RIEN COUPER  LON TIRE LA PIERRE AVEC UN CROCHET OU BIEN AVEC DE TENETTES AND A LITTLE AFTER LU RETRE DE FEMMES SE DILATE EXTRAORDINAIREMENT AINSI IL ARRIVE RAREMENT QUON SOIT OBLIGE DE LEUR FAIRE UNE INCISION THESE QUOTATIONS MAY SHEW HOW THAT RIGHT REASON ING TOGETHER WITH DUE EXPERIENCE HAVE NOT ONLY SUG GESTED BUT LIKEWISE APPROVED AND SETTLED THIS WAY OF EXTRACTING THE STONE OUT OF THE BLADDER OF WOMEN WITH OUT SECTION WHEN I WAS A STRANGER TO THIS PRACTICE I DID ONLY THEN PROPOSE IT TO BE WELL CONSIDERED OF BY THE JUDICIOUS BUT NOW THAT IT PROVES SO SUCCESFUL I CANNOT C BUT14 BUT RECOMMEND IT TO THE SKILFUL CHIRURGEON AS AN OPE RATION FIT FOR GENERAL USE IN THESE CASES BEING BOTH SAFE AND EASILY PRACTICABLE AND ALSO OF GREAT BENEFIT AND RE LIEF TO NO LESS THAN THE MOIETY OF MANKIND WHEN EVER THEY ARE AFFICTED WITH THIS PAINFUL DISEASE AND TO SAY TRULY IF WOMEN IN THIS CASE WOULD BUT TIMELY SEEK FOR HELP THEY MIGHT WITH FAR LESS DANGER AND PAIN BE RELIE VED OF THIS TORTURING AND LASTING EVIL THAN THEY ARE DE LIVERED OF A COMMON NATURAL BIRTH I SAY TIMELY SEEK FOR HELP THAT IS BEFORE THE STONE IS GROWN TO SO LARGE A MAGNITUDE AS NOT TO ADMIT THIS SORT OF OPERATION OF WHICH THERE MAY BE SOME INSTAN CES THOUGH I BELIEVE AS THE ATTEMPTING THE CURE OF SUCH WILL BE VERY DANGEROUS SO LIKEWISE THEY WILL BE VE RY RARELY MET WITH FOR EXPERIENCE JUSTIFIES WHAT I HAVE ELSEWHERE OBSERVED NUMB 202 OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS THAT WOMEN ARE NOT CAPABLE BY NATURE OF BREEDING STONES IN THEIR BLADDERS OF SO BIG A SIZE AS MEN FREQUENTLY DO WHICH IS MOST APPARENT FROM THOSE MA NY HISTORIES OF STUPENDIOUS LARGE STONES I MEAN THEM OF THE GREATEST MAGNITUDE REGISTRED BY BOTH GEORGE AND JOHN SCHENKIUS HILDANUS GREONEVELT THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER AUTHORS ALL WHICH THAT HAVE HI THERTO OCCURD TO ME HAVE BEEN ONLY FOUND IN MEN WHEREAS THE LARGEST I HAVE HEARD OF BRED IN A WOMANS BLADDER WAS NOT ONE FIFTH PART OF WHAT HAS BEEN PRODU CED OF THIS KIND IN A MANS IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS NUMB 222 THERE IS INSERTED AN ACCOUNT OF THE LARGEST STONE I HAVE YET HEARD OF BRED IN A MANS BLADDER THAT MENTIONED BY MR WOOD THE CHIRURGEON NUMB 209 OF THE SAME TRANS ACTIONS TAKEN OUT OF A WOMAN AND AS HE THOUGHT OF A PRODIGIOUS SIZE DOES NOT AMOUNT TO NEAR A FIFTH PART OF THIS HOWEVER THAT IS EXTRAORDINARY IN MR WOODS RE LATION THAT THOUGH IT WAS EXTRACTED BY SECTION AND THE MEM15 MEMBRANOUS PART OF THE BLADDER AS HE SAYS CUT IN THE OPERATION YET THE PATIENT RECOVERED AND BECAME PER FECTLY WELL BUT THESE AND SUCH LIKE SURPRISING CURES I TAKE TO BE ERRATICK OR ANOMALOUS IF I MAY SO CALL THEM BECAUSE THEY HAPPEN SELDOM AND WHEN THEY DO SEEM TO BE CONTRARY TO THE SETLED RULES OF PHYSICK AND THEREFORE CAN LITTLE AVAIL IN GUIDING A MANS PRACTICE ACCORDING TO THE SAYING QUAE RARA SUNT NOT SUNT ARTIS AND NOT WITHSTANDING SEVERAL SUCH RARE CASES DAILY EXPERIENCE WILL VOUCH FOR THE AUTHORITY OF THAT APHORISM OF HIP POCRATES    CUI SECTA EST VESICA LETHALE EST AS NOT BEING FOUNDED ON A SEW EXAMPLES OR A NOTION BUT WHAT COMMONLY HOLDS TRUE OR AS HIPPO CRATES OFTEN EXPRESSES IT     FOR THE MOST PART WHICH IS A SUFFICIENT AND INDEED THE ONLY PRINCI PLE ON WHICH WE MAY CONSTITUTE A STANDING RULE IN PHY SICK FOR AS THE JUDICIOUS CELSUS HAS TRULY OBSERVED IN HIS PREFACE TO HIS BOOK DE RE MEDICA VIX ULLA PERPE TUA PRAECEPTA MEDICINALIS ARS RECIPIT

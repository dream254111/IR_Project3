J100587,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16831775,103500,AN ACCOUNT OF SOME OBSERVATIONS RELATING TO NATURAL HISTORY MADE IN A JOURNEY TO THE PEAK IN DERBYSHIRE BY MR J MARTYN F R S,I206901,IV AN ACCOUNT OF SOME OBSERVATIONS RELATING TO NA TURAL HISTORY MADE IN A JOURNEY TO THE PEAK IN DERBYSHIRE BY MR J MARTYN F R S T H E PEAK IN DERBYSHIRE HAVING HITHERTO BEEN DESCRIBED IN SCARCE ANY OTHER LIGHT THAN AS A PLACE COMPOSED OF WONDERS I WAS NOT A LITTLE DE SIROUS TO MAKE SOME ENQUIRY INTO THE NATURE OF A PLACE GENERALLY ESTEEMED ONE OF THE MOST SURPRIZING OF OUR OWN COUNTRY IN MY WAY THITHER I TOOK NOTICE OF THE FOLLOW ING PLANTS WHICH I HAVE NOT OBSERVED TO BE COM MON23 MON IN OTHER PARTS OF ENGLAND AND ARE NOT TAKEN NOTICE OF BY THE BISHOP OF LONDON IN HIS EDITION OF CAMBDEN STACHYS FUCHSII J B IN THE ROAD TO GRANTHAM A LITTLE BEYOND COLESWORTH SCROPHULARIA SCORODONIAE FOLIO MOR AT WOLLER TON UNDER THE GARDENWALL THIS DOES NOT OWE ITS ORIGINE IN THIS PLACE TO SEEDS SCATTERED OUT OF THE GARDEN AS I AM CONVINCED BY THE PERUSAL OF A MANUSCRIPT CATALOGUE OF THE PLANTS CULTIVATED IN THAT GARDEN IN WHICH THERE IS NO MENTION MADE OF THIS PLANT THE LYCHNIS WHICH GROWS ON NOTTINGHAM CASTLE IS THE LYCHNIS SYLVESTRIS ALBA 9 CLUSII AND NOT THE SAME WITH MR RAYS LYCHNIS MAJOR NOCTI FLORA DUBRENSIS PERENNIS AS HE SUSPECTED FESTUCA HUMILIOR PANICULA BREVI HETEROMALLA GRAMEN PANICULATUM

GERWORTH THE PEAK IS FAMOUS FOR SEVEN PLACES WHICH HAVE BEEN DIGNIFIED BY OUR ANCESTORS WITH THE NAME OF WONDERS 1 CHATSWORTH A MAGNIFICENT SEAT OF HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE 2 MAMTOR 3 ELDENHOLE 4 THE EBBING AND FLOWING WELL 5 BUX24 5 BUXTONWELL 6 PEAKS HOLE AND 7 POOLS HOLE THE FIRST BEING A WORK NOT OF NATURE BUT ART DOES NOT COME WITHIN THE DESIGN OF THIS AC COUNT MAMTOR IS A HUGE PRECIPICE FACING THE EAST OR SOUTHEAST WHICH IS SAID TO BE PERPETUALLY SHIVERING AND THROWING DOWN GREAT STONES ON A SMALL ER MOUNTAIN BELOW IT AND THAT NEVERTHELESS NEI THER THE ONE INCREASES NOR THE OTHER DECREASES IN BIGNESS THIS MOUNTAIN IS COMPOSED CHIEFLY OF A SORT OF SLATESTONE CALLED IN THAT COUNTRY BLACK SHALE AND GREAT STONE THE NATURE OF THE BLACK SHALE IS KNOWN TO BE THAT NOTWITHSTANDING IT IS VE RY HARD BEFORE IT IS EXPOSED TO THE AIR YET IT IS AFTERWARDS VERY EASILY CRUMBLED TO DUST THUS ON ANY STORM OR MELTING OF SNOW THIS SHALE IS CON SIDERABLY WASTED AND AS THE GREAT STONES ARE GRA DUALLY DISENGAGED THEY MUST NECESSARILY FALL DOWN THAT IT IS ONLY AT THESE TIMES THAT THE MOUNTAIN WASTES IS AFFIRMED BY THE MOST INTELLIGENT OF THE NEIGHBOURING INHABITANTS AND THAT THIS DECAY IS NOT PERPETUAL I CAN AFFIRM MYSELF HAVING NOT ONLY TAKEN A CLOSE SURVEY OF IT BUT ALSO CLIMBED UP THE VERY PRECIPICE WITHOUT SEEING ANY OTHER SHIVERING IN THE MOUNTAIN THAN WHAT THE TREADING OF MY OWN FEET IN THE LOOSE CRUMBLED EARTH OCCASIONED THAT THE MOUNTAIN DOES NOT DECREASE IN THE MEAN TIME IS A TALE TOO FRIVOLOUS TO NEED ANY CON SIDERATION ELDENHOLE IS A HUGE PERPENDICULAR CHASM THE DEPTH OF IT IS NOT KNOWN MR COTTON TELLS US THAT HE SOUNDED 884 YARDS AND YET THE PLUMMET DREW BUT HE MIGHT EASILY BE DECEIVED UNLESS HIS PLUMMET WAS OF A VERY GREAT WEIGHT FOR OTHERWISE I IMAGINE THE25 THE WEIGHT OF A ROPE OF THAT LENGTH WOULD BE SO GREAT AS TO MAKE THE LANDING OF THE PLUMMET SCARCE PERCEIVABLE BE THAT AS IT WILL THE DEPTH OF IT IS TO BE SURE VERY CONSIDERABLE AND CONSIDERING THAT WE HAVE NO WHERE IN ENGLAND SO GOOD AN OPPORTUNITY OF SEARCHING THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH TO SO GREAT A DEPTH I WONDER NO CURIOUS PERSON HAS EVER HAD THE COURAGE TO VENTURE DOWN IT IS SAID INDEED THAT A POOR FELLOW WAS HIRED TO BE LET DOWN WITH A ROPE ABOUT HIS MIDDLE TWO HUNDRED YARDS AND THAT HE WAS DRAWN UP AGAIN OUT OF HIS SENSES AND DIED A FEW DAYS AFTER AND NO WONDER FOR THE POOR WRETCH HAVING NOTHING ELSE TO REFLECT ON IN THAT DISMAL PLACE BUT THE DANGER HE HAD PUT HIMSELF INTO FOR THE SAKE OF A LITTLE MONEY MIGHT PROBABLY BE FRIGHTNED OUT OF HIS SENSES OR INDEED THE VERY FATIGUE ITSELF MIGHT PUT HIM INTO THAT CONDITION AS ANY ONE WILL EASILY IMAGINE WHO HAS BEEN LET DOWN BUT A QUARTER OF THE WAY AND DRAWN UP AGAIN IN THAT MANNER BUT I CONCEIVE THAT IF ANY INTELLIGENT AND PRU DENT PERSON WAS TO BE LET DOWN IN A PROPER MACHINE HE WOULD NOT BE MUCH IN DANGER AND HIS FATIGUE WOULD BE VERY INCONSIDERABLE THE EBBING AND FLOWING WELL IS FAR FROM BEING RE GULAR AS SOME HAVE PRETENDED IT IS VERY SELDOM SEEN BY THE NEIGHBOURS THEMSELVES AND FOR MY PART I WAITED A GOOD WHILE AT IT TO NO PURPOSE AND SO I SHALL PASS IT OVER IN SILENCE BUXTONWELL HAS BEEN ESTEEMED A WONDER ON ACCOUNT OF TWO SPRINGS ONE WARM AND THE OTHER COLD RISING NEAR EACH OTHER BUT THE WONDER IS NOW LOST BOTH BEING BLENDED TOGETHER THE SPRING E WHICH26 WHICH IS NOW USED FOR BATHING

BATHING INCREASES THE WEIGHT OF THE BODY FOR THE PRESENT THOUGH IT CAUSES A PLENTIFUL PERSPIRATION AFTERWARDS WHICH I DO NOT REMEMBER THAT ANY ONE HAS HITHERTO OBSERVED 2DLY THAT THE PERSPIRATION AFTER THIS EXERCISE IS NOTHING NEAR SO LARGE AS DR KEILL  HAS DELIVERED T AMOUNTING BY HIS ACCOUNT TO ONE POUND AND A HALF N ONE HOURS TIME BY OUR OBSERVATION IT IS BUT  OUNCES IN ONE HOUR AND FROM EIGHT OUNCES AND HALF TO ONE POUND IN ONE HOUR AND A HALF THOUGH  BY MOTION WHICH MIGHT HAVE CAUSED US TO  BY DR KEILLS COMPUTATION  FROM THREE TO  OUNCES PEAKS HOLE AND POOLS HOLE ARE TWO REMARKABLE

ARE SO MUCH WONDERED AT IN THESE PLACES WHETHER THIS BE THE TRUE ORIGINE OF THESE CAVES OR NOT I SUBMIT TO THOSE WHO SHALL HEREAF TER HAVE THE CURIOSITY TO EXAMINE IT SEEMS MORE PRO BABLE TO ME THAN WHAT OTHERS HAVE HITHERTO PROPOSED THE THREE RIVERS AS THEY ARE COMMONLY CALLED IN PEAKS HOLE ARE ONLY SOME PARTS OF THE CAVE DEEPER THAN THE REST AND RECEIVING ALL THEIR WATER FROM THE SPRING WHICH COMES FROM THE FARTHER END OF THE CAVE THE WATER WHICH PASSES THROUGH POOLSHOLE IS IMPREGNATED WITH PARTICLES OF LIMESTONE AND SO HAS INCRUSTED AL MOST THE WHOLE CAVE IN SUCH A MANNER THAT IT APPEARS LIKE ONE SOLID ROCK THE MORE RARE PLANTS WHICH I OBSERVED IN THE PEAK ARE SCARIOLA SYLVESTRIS ANGUILLARAE LACTUCA SYLV MURORUM FLORE LUTEO J B ON OLD WALLS AND ABOUT THE ENTRANCE INTO PEAKSHOLE IT GROWS ALSO IN HERT FORDSHIRE I CHOOSE TO TAKE NOTICE OF IT ON THIS OC CASION THE RATHER BECAUSE M VAILLANT HAS EVIDENTLY MISTAKEN THE CHARACTERS OF IT IN HIS NEW DISTRIBUTION OF THE CICHORACEOUS TRIBE IN THE MEMOIRS OF THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES FOR THE YEAR 1721 HE THERE MAKES IT A SPECIES OF LACTUCA FROM WHICH IT IS VERY DIFFERENT ON HIS OWN PRINCIPLES ACCORDING TO HIS METHOD THE EMPALEMENT OF THE LACTUCA IS SQUAMOUS AND THE DOWN OF THE SEED SITS UPON A PEDICLE BUT THIS SPECIES HAS A SIMPLE EMPALEMENT AND A SESSILE DOWN THESE CHARACTERS EVIDENTLY DISTINGUISH IT NOT ONLY FROM LACTUCA BUT FROM EVERY GENUS IN HIS METHOD I SHALL TAKE LEAVE THEREFORE TO CONSTITUTE A NEW GENUS 2 AND29 AND AS THE NAME OF SCARIOLA BY WHICH ANGUILLARA HAS CALLED IT HAS NOT YET BEEN APPROPRIATED TO ANY O THER GENUS I SHALL APPROPRIATE IT TO THIS AND DEFINE IT AS FOLLOWS SCARIOLA IS A CICHORACEOUS PLANT WITH A SIMPLE EMPALEMENT A NAKED PLACENTA AND SEEDS CROWNED WITH A HAIRY SESSILE DOWN ROSA SYLV ALBA CUM

LEADMINES IN DERBYSHIRE ARE VERY VARIOUS WITH REGARD TO THEIR COURSES ONE INTO WHICH I WENT DOWN HAD TWO BRANCHES ONE RUNNING TO THE N E THE OTHER TO THE N W AND AS I WAS INFORMED ONE OF THE BEST THEY EVER DISCOVERED RAN DUE NORTH THEIR BREADTH AND DEPTH ARE FULL AS IRREGULAR THE BODIES THROUGH WHICH THEY DIG TO COME AT THE VEIN ARE GENE RALLY LIMESTONE AND BLACK SHALE BUT IT IS UNCERTAIN WHICH OF THE TWO IS UPPERMOST OF TWOMINES INTO WHICH I WENT DOWN IN ONE THEY HAD DUG FIRST THROUGH 26 YARDS OF LIMESTONE THEN THROUGH ONE OF BLACK SHALE IN THE OTHER FIRST THROUGH 42 YARDS OF SHALE AND THEN THROUGH 28 OF LIMESTONE THE SUBSTANCES WHICH THEY FIND MIXT WITH THE ORE ARE 1 CHERT THIS IS A KIND OF FLINT WHICH DR WOODWARD  SAYS IS CALLED SO WHEN IT IS FOUND IN THIN STRATA BUT IN THE PEAK THE STRATA OF CHERT ARE OFTEN FOUR YARDS THICK OR THICKER THEY ARE FOUND IN LIMESTONE AND NOT ALWAYS DISPOSED IN STRATA THOSE WHICH I TOOK NOTICE OF WERE GENERALLY EITHER BLACK OR OF SUCH A COLOUR AS THE INSPISSATED JUICE OF THE BUCK THORN BERRIES WHICH THE PAINTERS CALL BY THE NAME OF SAPGREEN WHENCE THEY ARE CALLED GREEN CHERTS AND BLACK CHERTS  METHOD OF FOSSILS P 21 2 SPAR31 2 SPAR THIS IS COMPOSED OF CRYSTAL MIXT WITH OTHER BODIES THOSE WHICH THEY CALL SUGARSPARS ARE THOSE WHOSE CRYSTALLISATIONS ARE VERY SMALL AND SO ON CRUMBLING TO PIECES HAVE THE APPEARANCE OF POW DERED SUGAR I HAVE TWO SORTS OF THESE WHITE AND BLUE DOGTOOTH SPAR IS A WHITE POINTED SPAR IN FORM AND COLOUR SOMETHING RESEMBLING TEETH 3 CAUK THIS DR WOODWARD  SAYS IS A COARSE TALKY SPAR BUT IN THAT SUBSTANCE WHICH I MET WITH IN THIS COUNTRY UNDER THE NAME OF CAUK I COULD NOT DISCOVER ANY FLEXIBILITY OR ELASTICITY WHICH THAT LEARNED WRITER HAS SET DOWN AS CHARACTERISTICKS OF TALK AND TALKY BODIES  IT SEEMS TO ME TO BE NOTHING BUT SPAR INCORPORATED WITH A COARSE EARTHY MATTER WHEN THIS CAUK IS MIXT WITH PELLUCID CRYSTALLISATI ONS OF SPAR IT IS CALLED BASTARD CAUK THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER BODIES MIXT IN THE MINES WITH LEADORE BUT AS THEY DID NOT OCCUR IN THOSE MINES WHICH I EXAMINED I SHALL OMIT THE MENTION OF THEM WHEN THE ORE IS BROUGHT UP FROM THE MINE IT IS BROKEN TO PIECES THAT THE SPAR CAUK OR OTHER BODIES WHICH ADHERD TO IT MAY BE THE MORE EASILY SEPARATED IT IS THEN THROWN INTO A LARGE SIEVE AND WASHED AND SO FARTHER PURIFIED FROM EXTRANEOUS BODIES AFTER THIS IT IS CARRIED TO THE FURNACE IN ORDER TO BE SMELTED THE FURNACE WHICH I SAW NEAR WORKSWORTH WAS VERY RUDE AND SIMPLE CONSISTING ONLY OF SOME LARGE ROUGH STONES PLACED IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO FORM A SQUARE CAVITY INTO WHICH THE ORE AND COALS ARE THROWN STRATUM SU PER STRATUM TWO GREAT BELLOWS CONTINUALLY BLOWING THE FIRE BEING MOVED ALTERNATELY BY WATER I SAW  METHOD OF FOSSILS P 18  CATALOGUE OF FOSSILS VOL I PART I P 57 NO32 NO OTHER FUEL USED ON THIS OCCASION BUT DRIED STICKS WHICH THEY CALL WHITE COAL  MR RAY INFORMS US THAT THEY USE BOTH WHITE AND BLACK COAL OR CHARCOAL IN CARDIGANSHIRE I SUPPOSE BECAUSE THAT ORE IS HARDER TO FLUX THE CHARCOAL MAKING A MORE VEHEMENT FIRE THEY GENERALLY THROW IN SOME SPAR ALONG WITH THE ORE WHICH IS THOUGHT BY IMBIBING THE SULPHUR TO MAKE IT FLUX MORE EASILY THEY FREQUENTLY THROW IN ALSO SOME COWKE OR CINDERS OF PITCOAL BECAUSE THEY THINK IT ATTRACTS THE DROSS AND SO MAKES AN EASIER SEPARATION OF IT FROM THE LEAD WHEN THE ORE IS MELTED IT RUNS OUT AT AN OPENING IN THE BOTTOM PART OF THE FRONT OF THE FURNACE THROUGH A SMALL CHANNEL MADE FOR THAT PURPOSE INTO A CYLINDRICAL VESSEL OUT OF WHICH IT IS LADED INTO THE MOULD THE DROSS OF THE ORE ON SMELT ING IS CALLED SLAG THIS SLAG IS AFTERWARDS SMELTED AGAIN WITH COWKE ONLY AND THE LEAD OBTAINED FROM IT IS CALLED SLAGLEAD THEIR WAY OF MAKING REDLEAD IS THE SAME WITH  MR RAYS ACCOUNT ONLY THEY USE THREE PARTS OF LEAD AND ONE OF SLAGLEAD AND THINK THAT THE REDLEAD MADE THUS IS BETTER THAN IF MADE WITHOUT SLAGLEAD  COLLECTION OF ENGLISH WORDS ED 2 P 174  IBID P 200 V THE

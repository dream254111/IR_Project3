EDWARD B ROSA PHD Bureau of Standards Washington D C Introduction CRITICISM of the Federal Govern ment is the vogue nowadays With taxes and surtaxes that are direct and heavy enough to be seriously felt the industries slowed up and wages and prices in readjustment nearly every one finds some reason for criticism The executive departments are charged with being inefficient extravagant and overdeveloped and are popularly sup posed to be wasting large sums of the peoples money It has even been sug gested that the high cost of living is due to the high cost of government and that if reasonable economies were introduced in the executive depart ments the cost of living would be appre ciably reduced If it were stated that high prices and the high cost of liv ing were due to the direct and indirect consequences of the war the truth of the statement would not be questioned But when it is asserted that they are caused by the high cost of govern ment it appears desirable to inquire What is the cost of government What are the functions of government And what becomes of the four or five or six billions of dollars annually col lected in taxation Since the war the expenses of the government have increased enormous ly and it seems to have been assumed by some that the civil bureaus and de partments have increased their activi ties and expenses in the same propor tion as the total has increased Much has been said and written about the great expansion of the bureaus and the need for curbing their growth and cutting their estimates is often em phasized Some writers while saying little of their usefulness or the increased need of their services say much of their inefficiency extravagance and overdevelopment and of the duplica tion of work by different bureaus or de partments These statements are us ually made in general terms and without proof or particulars but they appear to be made in good faith and apparently with the belief that bureau officers are more anxious to expand their functions and spend money than to increase the efficiency and useful ness of their respective bureaus This opinion is so seriously at variance with what one should expect that it appears worth while to examine the facts in the case A prominent western paper recently said The people are willing to pay the cost of the war They are willing to pay ade quate salaries and wages for all the public officials and employes actually needed for government work But everyone knows that government expenditures in the nation the state and the municipality are enor mously swollen by unnecessary depart ments commissions bureaus boards offi cials and employes to swell the list of soft places for party workers The biggest issue today in this country is the tax issue The government may take warning now the people will not stand for increasing burdens of taxation for party loot and pub lic waste Such ideas have been expressed over and over again in editorials on the platform and in resolutions of public bodies But some writers go further and assert that not only is there a large surplus of federal employes in the de 2 19 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY partments but that taken as a class they are inefficient and unprofitable Such a serious indictment of the gov ernment deserves to be examined and if found to be true the responsibility should be placed and the remedy ap plied Congress has already acted in the matter of appropriations and has made radical reductions in many directions It has also under consideration an executive budget a rearrangement of some of the bureaus a classification and standardization of the personnel of the government and other construc tive measures looking to increased efficiency in the public service No body will welcome efforts to increase the efficiency of the government serv ice more cordially than the permanent civil service staff of the government or what should be the permanent staff but in these later days is anything but permanent Such efforts are timely and will perhaps be facilitated by fur ther discussion of the functions and cost of government for there is a good deal of misunderstanding and miscon ception in the public mind regarding the work of the Federal Government its scope and value and cost The Functions of Government Henry C Adams in his treatise on the Science of Finance classifies govern mental functions into three groups a The protective functions of govern ment b the commercial functions of government and c the developmental functions of government a The protective functions of gov ernment are divided into three princi pal classes 1 Protection against in vasion or encroachment from without is provided by the Army and Navy and this has always been an important and relatively expensive department of a national government 2 Protec tion of life property and reputation which is accomplished through police fire departments and the courts 3 Protection against the spread of disease either physical or social As crime is looked upon as a phase of so cial disease this will include prisons asylums sanitary provision public charities etc b The commercial functions of government include those which render a service for which payment is made by the individuals served and are in general selfsupporting They address themselves primarily to the personal needs of the citizen rather than to the social needs of the state and are per formed by the state because it can render the service better or cheaper than private agencies These services are generally such as can be rendered better by a single agency having a monopoly rather than by many com peting agencies Hence it is usually a choice between the government per forming the service or supervising the private agency which does so Ex amples are the post office railways canals telegraphs and other public utilities patents and insurance c The developmental functions of government are such as spring from a desire on the part of society to attain higher forms of social life Society is not merely a collection of individuals but is a conscious organism and the interests of society require collective action in its development This in cludes 1 Public education 2 public recreation 3 providing those legal and administrative conditions in which private business will be conducted in a just and equitable manner 4 investi gation and control of public utilities 5 developing the resources and wealth of the state which includes scientific and industrial research and the coiip eration of the government with scien tific and engineering societies and theEXPENDITURES AND REVENUES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 3 industries in engineering and industrial standardization DEVELOPMENTAL FUNCTIONS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT These three classes of functions are exercised to some extent by municipal and state governments as well as the Federal Government The powers of the Federal Government were delegated to it by the states and were intended to be those required for the exercise of sovereignty by the nation in its relation with other nations the maintenance of a national army and navy the provi sion of a national currency a common postal system a uniform system of weights and measures although this was not carried out as intended the regulation of interstate commerce etc In the early years of our history so ciety was relatively simple communi cation and travel were infrequent and each community was compara tively independent Hence local gov ernments were in many respects more important than national With the developments in transportation and communication which have re sulted from steam and electricity the fortyeight states have come very close together commerce and industry have much in common everywhere uniform ity of practice and uniformly good practice are generally desired and it has been a problem how to avoid con fusion of administration and industrial practice when there were so many legislative and administrative bodies in the various states acting independ ently of each other This has been partly accomplished by the cooipera tion of federal agencies with state bodies leaving the legal authority with the states But very much re mains to be accomplished in this regard and in many cases where cotip eration is greatly needed the Federal Government is doing little or nothing Many protective and developmental functions have long been exercised by the Federal Government because they were of common interest to all the peo ple they could be performed more effectively and more economically by the Federal Government than by the several states and there was difficulty in getting all the states to work in har monyon a common program Thepeo ple who support the Federal Govern ment are the same people who support the fortyeight state governments and hence the plan of acting together through the Federal Government in performing functions of interest to all is not only economical and efficient but logical and just In practice it has worked out exceedingly well in many cases where a single agent can perform the service more efficiently than many agencies On the other hand there are some cases such as vocational and agricultural education and the con struction of improved highways where the Federal Government is promoting activity and cotiperation among the states by aiding in the financial support of work carried on by the states SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH A LUXURY OR A NECESSITY For many years the revenues of the Federal Government were ample and easily obtained Taxation was indi rect and not felt and many of the devel opmental functions of the government were exercised with little question or objection The Great War involved enormous expenditures and increased the fixed charges due to the public debt and other war obligations to several times the former budget The result is that expenditures for education scientific research and development work are severely scrutinized and the question is raised as to whether we can afford to carry on such work on a gen erous scale It is of course proper4 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY that every item in the national budget be closely scrutinized and that nothing be passed which can not justify itself It is desirable therefore to inquire whether scientific and industrial re search as carried on by the Federal Government is a luxury or a necessity whether it is something to be enjoyed when taxes are light and curtailed when taxes are heavy or whether it is creative and wealthproducing and therefore to be increased and developed when expenses are abnormally large and a heavy debt must be liquidated The question is in short whether sci entific and industrial research and edu cation and other developmental work of the government are like good seed and fertilizer to a farmer which are es sential to the best success or whether they are as luxuries to the rich which should be curtailed when necessary expenses increase Before discussing this question further however we may consider the organization of the Federal Government and the classification of its activities As a basis of such classi fication we may take the governments budget of expenditures and revenues analyzing and classifying them accord ing to the functions of the various branches of the service Distinction Between Gross Expend itures and Net Expenses of Government Departments Some months ago the writer made a study of the appropriations for all branches of the government service for the fiscal year 1920 These appropria tions were analyzed and classified into six groups1 The result showed that for the fiscal year 1990 three per cent of the total budget was appropriated for general governmental purposes legislative executive and judicial three per cent for public works one per cent for research education and devel opment and 93 per cent for the army and navy railroad deficit shipping board pensions warrisk insurance and interest on the public debt all of which are either obligations arising from the war or preparation for pos sible future wars In order to get a more accurate knowledge of government expenditures and to ascertain how they have in creased in recent years the receipts and expenditures of all departments for the past ten years have since been analyzed using the official published records of the Treasury Department for the purpose but following a somewhat different and more detailed classifica tion Appropriation bills do not show the earnings or credits to bureaus and departments and hence in many cases are misleading as to the real cost of a given branch of the service In some cases the whole cost and in other cases a large part of the cost is covered by fees or earnings Examples of such cases are the Consular Service the Patent Office the Land Office the Reclamation Service the Bureau of Navigation the Forest Service Na tional Bank examinations the Federal Reserve Board and notably the Post Office A billion dollar Congress was a familiar phrase in prewar days and this was generally supposed to mean that the National Government cost the taxpayers a billion dollars a year This however was not the case It meant merely that the total appro priations by Congress that is the au thorized gross annual disbursements of the government including the entire business of the Post Office Department amounted to a billion dollars per an num In no single year prior to our entry into the Great War were the net expenses of the government payable 1 The Economic Importance of the Scientific Work of the Government Journal of the Wash ington Academy of Sciences vol 10 pp 341382 1920EXPENDITURES AND REVENUES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 5 from taxation as much as seven hun dred millions of dollars The impor tant distinction between gross disburse ments and net expenses should be emphasized for it is often overlooked This study has yielded results of very great interest and value and throws much light on the question of the cost of government and whether the civil activities of the Federal Govern ment are overdeveloped and to what extent they are a burden upon the tax payer In what follows comparatively little will be said of the military side of the government except to give its expend itures Its importance and necessity are taken for granted and no criticism is intended in pointing out the large amount required for such purposes The writer is strongly in favor of an adequate and efficient army and navy but he expresses no opinion as to what is adequate or how much should be spent for the purpose2 DISBURSEMENTS RECEIPTS AND NET EXPENSES FOR TEN YEARS In order to obtain a correct idea of the actual expenses of the various de partments and bureaus of the govern ment it is necessary to takeaccount of their earnings and of credits for the sale 2 The Bureau of Standards during the war did a large amount of research and testing for the army and navy using for the purpose its own funds so far as they were available and a great deal more transferred by the military depart ments Since the war some of these military researches have been continued and others under taken with funds provided by the army and navy It is a pleasure to testify to the cordial relations that have existed between this bureau and these departments and the generous appreciation by the latter of the work done for them by the Bureau of Standards Nothing in this article should be understood as a criticism of either de partment or as depreciating the importance of military preparedness The aim is to set forth the facts as to expenditures and to emphasize and urge the importance of research and educa tion in the interest of civil and military efficiency of government property of trust funds received and disbursed and of unex pended appropriations turned back into the Treasury The Treasury Department publishes each year a Combined Statement of Receipts Dis bursements Balances etc of all depart ments for which appropriations are made as well as of revenues collected and these official publications have been used in this study The ten fiscal years 19101919 inclusive were first taken before the report for 1990 was available A study of 1990 has since been added In some cases appropriations greatly exceed actual net expenses and on the other hand certain continuing and indefinite appropriations do not appear explicitly in current appropriations Fees and fines proceeds from the sale of government property and other col lections are turned into the Treasury and recorded under miscellaneous re ceipts and can not be expended by the department or bureau collecting them During the fiscal years 1910 to 1917 in clusive the amounts of these miscel laneous receipts ranged from fortyfive to eighty million dollars each year In the two war years 1918 and 1919 taken together they amounted to over nine hundred million dollars including several hundred millions for interest on loans to European governments Expenditures and receipts are dis tributed among the 106 items of the eight groups of government agencies3 and net revenues and net expenses determined for each item and each group and the whole added and bal anced and checked against the figures given in the summaries published by the Treasury Department For each year a summary statement was also made for group IX showing the rev enues collected through the customs internalrevenue taxes and taxation a See page 10116 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY of nationalbank circulation These are the only revenues resulting from taxation fees and fines and the pro ceeds of sales of government property being credited to departments as stated above as an offset to expenses For example the fees collected by the State Department or the Patent Office or the Land Office or the Bureau of Navigation or a federal court are not intended as taxes for governmental revenue but rather as fees to cover in part or in whole the expense incurred in rendering a special service or adjudi cating a specific case or as an adminis trative measure and are properly credited against the expenses of the given agency Most if not all of these agencies per form public functions and thus render a service to the public as a whole apart from the service to individuals for which a fee is collected It is thus proper that the public as a whole should pay for the general service to the public if the individuals served pay for the individual service which they receive But it is obviously unfair and misleading to charge against a de partment or bureau the entire expense and not credit to that department or bureau fees and other earnings or re ceipts from government property sold all of which have caused the expenses of the given department to be greater than otherwise An extreme case of the kind is the Post Office The Postal Service ac count is kept separate from the General Fund of the Treasury and includes all the receipts of postoffice business and all expenses other than salaries for the central administration of the Post Office Department and certain items of a general character In addition to these overhead items paid from the Treasury which amount on the average to less than one per cent of the postal revenues the net deficiency or net sur plus is transferred over to the General Fund of the Treasury in a single item each year During the ten fiscal years 19101919 the total of the surplus amounted to 96033448 and the total of deficiencies amounted to 30890 619 leaving a net deficit of only 4857171 for the entire tenyear period with a total business of nearly three billions of dollars The deficit was thus less than twotenths of one per cent of the total business The total of the surpluses transferred to the general fund of the Treasury from the postal service account exceeded the deficits by 14399161 whereas the overhead and miscellaneous expenses of the Post Office Department paid directly from the Treasury amounted to 19256332 The difference be tween these sums is the net deficit given above which is an average of less than half a million dollars per year This is in addition to 110000000 special war revenue collected while threecent letter postage was in effect The excess revenue resulting from the extra cent charged which was regarded as a war tax was all transferred to the General Fund The expenditures on the Panama Canal while under construction were included in the Public Works group but after its opening the cost of routine operation and maintenance together with tolls collected were placed in group I while the cost of additions and betterments was included in group III The cost of the fortifica tions of the Panama Canal however has been charged in this study to the War Department as a military ex penditure On the other hand the large sums spent for river and harbor improvements which are expended by the army and charged to the War De partment in the Treasury account have been charged in this study to Public Works on the ground that these imEXPENDITURES AND REVENUES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 7 provements are for civil rather than military purposes The Reclamation Service has annual appropriations of about nine million dollars but it is provided that it can not expend any more money than is re ceived annually through the sale of public lands and by collections from settlers for lands they occupy or for water received by them for irrigation purposes Thus the ninemilliondol lar appropriation to the Reclamation Service is only an authorization to use the money which they annually col lect or which has been turned into the Treasury by the Land Office and hence the Reclamation Service costs the tax payers very little Some years ago 20000000 was indeed advanced to the Reclamation Service as a loan in addition to the receipts from land sales and collections from irrigation proj ects This has all been expended and this year a first installment of one million dollars will be paid into the Treasury toward the liquidation of the loan The appropriations for the District of Columbia for the current fiscal year amount to over sixteen millions of dollars but some parts of this sum are borne entirely from the revenues of the District and 60 per cent of the remain der is also paid by the District Not much over onethird of the total is borne by the federal treasury The Treasury Department maintains a large force of nationalbank exami ners and expended in 1919 more than a million dollars for their salaries and expenses but it collects and reim burses the Treasury for every dollar of it through assessments upon the banks It also collects nearly a half a million dollars a year from national banking associations on account of salaries and contingent expenses of the Treasurer of the United States and the Comp troller of the Currency The ex penditures in 1919 for Indian affairs amounted to 33350447 but more than twothirds of this sum was the Indians own money which the govern ment handled as trustee for the In dians Only 10218327 was borne out of taxation as an actual expense to the government These examples are given to illus trate the important distinction between gross disbursements and net expenses of the various departments of the gov ernment and to show how misleading it is to look at only one side of the account as one does in looking only at the appropriations A Functional Classification of the Activities of the Federal Government In order to get a proper perspective of the various activities of the Federal Government protective commercial and developmental the departments bureaus commissions and other gov ernmental agencies have been classified according to their functions into eight groups A ninth group includes the sources of revenue from direct or in direct taxation In the following brief description of these eight groups the total net expenses of each group for the fiscal year 1920 is given A detailed list of the constituents of each group is given on pp 1011 and the expenditures are discussed below GROUP IPrimary governmental functions legislative executive and judicial including Congress the President and White House staff depart ments of State Justice Post Office and most of

The first three groups include all the normal civil activities of the govern ment the next three the current costs of the Army and Navy the care of soldiers and the obligations arising from the war

works a total of 345 The remainder 5001 went for military expenditures and paying for past wars These civil expenses certainly do not seem unrea sonable Indeed they are surprisingly small when we consider the wide range of Federal Governmental activities and Per Cent Per Capita Group IPrimary Governmental Functions 39 211  IIResearch Education and Development 10 054  IIIPublic Works 15 080

the country on June 30 1920 106380000 we have the per capita costs of each group Thus the expenses of three civil groups together amount to 64 per cent of the total and the military groups including interest and reduction of the public debt paying for the war amount to 936 per cent of the total Before the war as we shall see later when we come to examine the prewar expenditures of the government the civil expenses constituted a much larger part of the total while of course during the war they were much less The second column in the above table gives the per capita costs of government in 1920 Of the total of 5346 per capita revenue collected through taxation in 1920 211 was spent for the primary functions of government legislative executive and judicial 54 cents was spent for re the high costs of conducting business of all kinds in 1920 The net cost pay able from taxation of municipal govern ment in New York Chicago and Philadelphia in 1918 was 3022 per capita In 1920 it was consider ably more probably not less than 10 times the per capita cost of the civil side of the Federal Government as defined above One is led to wonder how it is possi ble to operate a great national govern ment adequately on a per capita cost of 211 for the primary governmental functions and whether if instead of 54 cents per capita for research educa tion and development twice as much had been spent it would not have made the burden of taxation lighter instead of heavier by rendering a greater service to the people and creating wealth and aiding industry in larger measure Before attempting to answer these questions or going further with the study of the costs of government we must make a more detailed classifica tion of the governments activities and10 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY may then take a rapid but somewhat more detailed survey of the activities of the government in the various groups in order to better appreciate what was accomplished in 1920 by 345 per capita in the three civil groups and by 5001 in the remaining groups of the government In the following classification the grouping is by functions but the order in the groups is largely determined by the order in

Office War Revenue Sales of Government Lands are credited to the Reclamation Service It is of course impossible to make a perfectly logical group classification19 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY of government activities without split ting up some bureaus into parts as many perform both governmental and educational or developmental functions In such cases the bureau is classed ac cording to its major activities The first five items of group I are clearly governmental but the Library of Congress our national library which also is included under legislative in the appropriations is assigned to group II because its functions are primarily educational rather than gov ernmental although the copyright division taken by itself would have been classed with group I Items 7 8 and 9 are the civil commissions reporting directly to the President given in ap propriation bills under executive al though items 42 and 45 under the heading independent commissions also report directly to the President Items 10 and 11 covering the State Department are obviously govern mental and belong in group I Items 12 to 19 include all the functions of the Treasury Department except the Pub lic Health Service part of which is included under group II item 73 and part in group V item 94 the work of the supervising architects office maintenance and operation of public buildings item 48 and construction of public buildings item 83 and the War Risk Insurance item 92 of group V In the Interior Department items 20 to 25 cover the governmental func tions whereas the Geological Survey Bureau of Mines Bureau of Education and Howard University items 66 to 68 are in group II because of their research and educational work and the Reclamation Service item 86 is in group III because it is so largely new construction The Post Office Depart ment proper includes the salaries and expenses of the overhead administra tion in the District of Columbia and item 27 includes minor miscellaneous items Item 28 is the deficiency or surplus usually brought over once a year from the postal service fund which is kept separate in the Treasury to which is credited all the revenues from the entire postal service and to which is charged the entire operating expenses of the postal service The result of this is that the net cost of the entire Post Office Department appears each year in the sum of items 26 27 and 28 and as already explained there was a surplus in five of the ten years from 1910 to 1919 inclusive and a slightly larger aggregate deficit in five In 1920 there was a relatively large deficit because of increase in salaries to postal employes and addi tional compensation to the railroads In the Department of Agriculture items 29 to 32 cover governmental functions and items 50 to 65 in group II the research and educational work Item 29 includes the statutory salaries mainly administrative and clerical for all the bureaus they are not given separately for each bureau in the Treasury publications It is believed that by charging this item to group I and the lump sum appropriations to the respective bureaus in group II we have a fair allocation of expenses between the governmental and educa tional work In the Department of Commerce it is difficult to make a decision in some cases as between groups I and II but it is believed that the grouping given is a fair division If the bureaus were to be split up and a more detailed classification made the amounts al lotted to group II would probably be somewhat reduced The Department of Labor is divided between group I items 38 and 39 and group

REVENUES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 1s District in lieu of taxes on federal property recently however the ratio of expense has been changed by Con gress to 40 per cent by the Federal Government and 60 per cent by the District Both the War and Navy Departments are of course doing a large amount of scientific and engineer ing work but as it is of direct military application it is proper to leave it in group IV The Naval Observatory however is doing astronomical work of a scientific rather than naval character and might have been in cluded in group II Further explana tion of these various activities will follow Before proceeding to an examination of the activities of the government in the various groups let us examine the summarized balance sheet for the eleven fiscal years 19100 showing the receipts from taxation and net disbursements for current expenses as well as the total of loans and trust funds and the net balance each year of public debt transactions Net Revenue and Net Expenses The accompanying table 1 gives a summarized balance sheet of govern ment net revenues and net expendi tures for the eleven fiscal years 1910 1920 inclusive that is from July 1 1909 to June 30 1920 This is the re sult of the detailed analysis mentioned above of the governments receipts and expenditures for this period and may be given here in order to obtain a gen eral view of the expenditures by groups before proceeding to a more detailed consideration of the functions and costs of the activities within the various groups Line 1 gives the customs receipts less refunds that is the net revenue to the Treasury from customs These amounts differ from the amounts given in the Treasury reports as the latter give under receipts the gross receipts including overpayments and deposits intended to be refunded and include under disbursements the refunds along with expenses Line 2 gives in the same way the internal revenue receipts less refunds that is the net revenue after refunds are deducted Line 3 gives the tax on national bank circulation which is a taxation for revenue and not payment for a serv ice rendered Line 4 gives the revenue derived from the Post Office during the war period when three cent letter postage was in effect the third cent having been a war tax and the entire proceeds turned into the Treasury Line 5 gives the total revenue derived from taxation being the sum of the above four items Line 6 gives the receipts in excess of disbursements or vice versa of loans trust funds and seigniorage in connec tion with coinage Up to 1916 the receipts each year were in excess of disbursements since then due to loans to European governments the disbursements have largely exceeded the receipts Line 7 gives the balance of public debt transactions When the payments exceeded the receipts the public debt decreased and the amount is preceded by a minus sign and marked with a star in such cases the amount is to be substracted in making the additions Line 8 gives the amount that was expended from the general fund in other words the increase or decrease of cash on hand in the Treasury at the end of each year as compared with the beginning A mi nus sign indicates that more was put into the general fund than drawn out that is the general fund increased during the year Line 9 gives the sum of net revenues from taxation and net funds available from the abovenamed financial transactions that is the total14 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY sum available to pay the expenses of the government for each year Line 10 gives the total net expenses for the civil activities of the govern ment included in group I that is the legislative executive and judicial group Line 11 gives the expenses for group II research education and develop ment Line 12 gives the expenses for group III the new construction classed as public works Line 13 gives the total for these three civil groups which averages 211337288 per year for the ten years 191019 inclusive or 214 per capita of the population of the country Line 14 gives the net expenses for the army and navy group IV line 15 gives pensions and care of soldiers and War Risk Insurance during the war line 16 gives the cost of the special war activities during the years 191720 inclusive line 17 gives interest charges being interest on the public debt and trust funds less interest received and also in recent years less discount on liberty bonds repurchased Line 18 gives the total of the current expenses of each year equal to the sums given in line 9 Below is given a more condensed statement of net revenue and net ex pense with loans trust funds and pub lic debt transactions omitted showing the surplus or deficit each year There was a deficit of net revenue from taxa tion below net expenses every year except 1911 1916 and 1920 The surplus in 1920 was 107918172303 counting loans as investments and not expenses This surplus was used to gether with a considerable sum from the general fund in making loans to farmers and to European governments and in reducing the public debt the latter having been reduced by 1184 09832146 during the fiscal year 1920 Figure 1 shows graphically the rela tive net expenses of the government during the elevenyear period with a total of 33424762337 not including the loans to European governments and other loans and trust funds and figure 2 shows the relative revenues during the same period and plotted to the same scale The Cost of the War From the figures given in Table 1 it is possible to calculate the expendi tures on account of the war over and above what would probably have been expended had the war not occurred Figure 3 gives a graphical representa tion of the expenditures during the eleven fiscal years 191020 divided into three parts At the left are the total net expenses of the government shown in a series of small rectangles from 1910 to 1916 inclusive drawn to scale Below these seven years are the four years 191720 with the expenses estimated as what they would have been if the war had not occurred These are the total net expenses of groups I II and III plus the estimated expenses for the Army and Navy 275000000 per year pensions 160 000000 per year interest on the public debt 25000000 total for these three items 460000000 The excess over this sum of the expenditures for groups IV V VI and VII during these four years is plotted at the right as the cost of the war The amount of loans to European governments is plotted be low the war cost on the same scale Table 2 in the first column gives the excess of the expenses of the government over the estimated nor mal expense as shown in Figure 3 The second column gives the excess of revenues from taxation over the same estimated normal expense The sums of these amounts for four years gives in the first column the total expenditures on account of the warEXPENDITURES AND REVENUES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 15 TOTAL NET EXPENSES

have paid over and above the estimated normal expenses of the government 455 per cent of the cost of the war leaving 545 per cent to be this expenditure What is the reason for so many departments and bureaus Is it practicable or desirable to reduce the number or to abandon some of the work done Figure 4 shows the aver age net expenditures by departments and figure 5 the average total expendi tures

included in group I comprise the legislative executive and judicial functions of a great government and cost the people of this country 105755525 per year on the average for the ten fiscal years 191019 inclusive It is a fair ques tion to ask what is accomplished by House of Representatives and the cler ical and operating staff for the Capitol and the Senate and House Office build ings and the maintenance of the Capi tol buildings and grounds with an average expenditure for ten years of 8347167 This includes also under legislative miscellaneous during this period the greater portion of the cost of the beautiful memorial to Abraham Lincoln now nearing completion The government printing office which serves all branches of the gov ernment legislative executive and judicial and is one of the largest print ing offices in the world expended an average of 5770278 above receipts This seems a large sum but it is only about five cents per capita per year of the population of the country and

seems very moderate if not indeed inadequate During this tenyear period paper and printing outside the government has more than doubled in cost and yet the expenditure by the government print ing office increased very little until 1918 and less than 50 per cent during 1918 and 1919 over the 191017 av erage notwithstanding the great in crease in governmental activities due to the war during those years and the great increase in the cost of materials and labor In some departments there have been little or no increases in appropriations in recent years not withstanding the large increase in printing costs and the growth of their work This of course means a very considerable reduction in printing and less educational work in proportion which in some departments at least was very seriously felt The average expenditure for the President VicePresident and White House staff was 201045 per year and for the Civil Service and Tariff Com missions and the Bureau of Efficiency together 526798 the entire executive group costing less than one cent per year per capita of the countrys population The Civil Service Commission is one of the lowest paid branches of the serv ice and its staff is so inadequate for the great volume of work thrown upon it that it has had to borrow more than two hundred men and women from other departments to keep up with its most urgent work It has been un able even to attempt to do generally throughout the service the very impor tant work of supervision and cotipera tion with administrative officers that the Civil Service law contemplates The Bureau of Efficiency occupies an important field part of what a budget bureau would be expected to cover Surely one would expect in a reorgan ized and developed government serv ice that this group of activities included under executive would be consider ably expanded rather than curtailed and that in the interest of efficiency and good government more money rather than less would be expended upon it The State Department is our depart ment of foreign affairs It conducts correspondence and negotiations with foreign governments deals with the representatives of foreign governments in this country is the channel of com munication between the President and the chief executives of all the separate states and records and promulgates all laws passed by Congress It main tains diplomatic and consular repre sentatives in nearly all countries of the world Aside from the salaries of a large staff of accredited representatives and their assistants and clerks the cost of travel and communication is neces sarily very large The war threw an enormously increased responsibility on the State Department both at home and abroad and its net expenditures increased from an average of 2614 643 during the period 191016 to 3648075 in 1917 4677254 in 1918 7250190 in 1919 and 8520517 in 1990 Americans who traveled abroad before the war felt the need of more adequate provision for our foreign representatives and if the increased appropriations of the last few years have enabled the State Department under these trying conditions to over come some of the handicaps of the past and to cope adequately with the problems brought on by the war we ought to be grateful for the more gen erous appropriations The Treasury Department not only handles the fiscal affairs of the govern ment but it supervises the banking of the nation It maintains the national currency collects the revenues turns over to disbursing officers in all deTABLE 3 AGGREGATE EXPENDITURES AND FOREIGN LOANS OF U S

Group I for each year and for the tenyear average The increases since 1916 in the State Treasury and Justice Departments are in large part attributable to increased activities resulting from the war as for example the expansion of the Diplomatic and Consular Service and the increased allowances necessitated by increased living costs abroad as well as increased administrative overhead the collection and disbursement of the large sums required to meet the cost of the war and added activities incident to the anti profiteering sedition and espionage acts In the case of the Post Office

imports clas sifying and appraising the same levy ing and collecting the customs duties thereon It manages through the Commissioner of Internal Revenue the collection of all income and other internal revenue taxes the enforce ment of internal revenue laws and the national Prohibition Act This is the largest division of the Treasury De partment and collects the great bulk of the revenue of the government More than five billions of dollars were col lected last year at a cost for collection of only 06 per cent including the cost of enforcing all the revenue and pro hibition laws This is a remarkable business organi zation of which the Treasury Depart ment is proud and there are large numbers of people in the country who marvel at the completeness of its knowl edge of the business it handles The net expenditures of the Treasury De partment in group I averaged 29680 620 during 191016 and were 33383 599 in 1917 40186382 in 1918 56301012 in 1919 and 75653377 in 1920 The business of the Treasury was greatly increased by the war al though the above figures do not include the special expenses of selling liberty bonds Only a part of the work of the In terior Department is included in group I The Land Office and Land Service had an income of more than half their expenses the net expense above re ceipts averaging 1899153 The Pat ent Office expended on the average 1465657 per year and earned 2135 202 its total earnings in ten years above expenses being 6695450 An effort is being made to secure for the Patent Office higher salaries and a larger staff in order to improve its service The public pays in fees more than the total cost and it is very im portant that the service be competent and satisfactory The average net expenses of the Indian Service for the ten years was 9893738 per year This includes the expenses of the In dian agencies the support of Indians the support of Indian schools and fulfilling treaty stipulations with the Indians It does not include the trust funds handled for the Indians or the interest on these trust funds which funds now amount to over thirty million dollars The Post Office Department as already explained was very nearly selfsupporting during this tenyear period the net deficiency amounting to only 485717 on the average less than a quarter of one per cent of the business24 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY done All government mail service is carried free and newspapers within the county where published but outside of cityfree delivery areas are carried free There has been little increase of postage rates except the extra cent on first class matter during the war and that was all turned over to the Treasury as war revenue4 This gratifying result however probably can not be con tinued In 1920 there was a deficit of 38000000 caused by increase of com pensation to employes and the rail roads The railroads and other public utilities have found it necessary to in crease rates in some cases nearly 100 per cent and it should not be surpris ing if the Post Office found it necessary to make further increases in rates In the Agricultural Department the meat inspection service the enforce ment of grain standards pure food laws animal quarantine acts the acquisition of lands to protect water sheds together with administrative and governmental work cost on an average 9149616 per year These are governmental functions of a very fundamental character mostly in the interest of the public health and could not well be curtailed The scientific work of the department is included in group II In the Department of Commerce the general administration of the de partment the Bureau of Navigation the Steamboat Inspection Service the Bureau of Lighthouses and the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce all together cost on an average 6852 318 per year above earnings from the tenyear period The Bureau of Navi 4 The postal rates for second class matter were increased at the beginning of the fiscal year 1919 The revenues were thereby increased for this last year of the tenyear period about 4800000 which is a little more than one per cent of the postal revenues for the year In 1920 the corresponding increase was about 12035000 nearly three per cent of the total postal revenues gation has charge of the commercial marine the issue of registers enroll ments and licensing of vessels the enforcement of the navigation laws and laws governing radio communica tion and other matters connected with shipping The Steamboat Inspection Service inspects vessels and their boilers and equipment and licenses marine engineers and others The duties devolving on these inspection services have greatly increased and the department feels the need for more ample funds for the work The Bureau of Lighthouses is charged with the establishment and mainte nance of aids to navigation on the sea and lake coasts and some rivers of the United States such as lighthouses and lightships buoys and lights and publishes information for mariners The importance of such aids to naviga tion and the small number of lives lost per annum upon ships in our waters constitute it is believed a full justifica tion for the work and expense of this Service The Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce is concerned with the de velopment of commerce and our export trade The importance of foreign trade to a great nation and the oppor tunity and duty of the government in fostering that trade in all legitimate ways need not be emphasized In view of the position of America as a world power and in view of the general desire that our foreign commerce may be not only profitably but creditably conducted it would seem that this function of the government should be developed and strengthened The Immigration and Naturalization service was more than selfsupporting during the five fiscal years 191014 by reason of the fees collected from immigrants During the five war years 191519 immigration fell off very greatly however and the receiptsEXPENDITURES AND REVENUES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 25 decreased correspondingly The aver age net cost of these services for the tenyear period amounted to 465244 per year which was only about 13 per cent of the total cost A considerable amount of useful educational work is being done in the Bureau of Naturaliza tion in preparing for citizenship those who are being naturalized and it would be of immense value to the country if this work could be greatly strengthened The Department of Justice is the law department of the government It has charge of the governments interests in cases in the federal courts and furnishes solicitors to all the other departments It exercises gen eral superintendence and direction over United States attorneys and marshals in all judicial districts throughout the country Its activities have been greatly increased by the war and its net expenses have increased from an average of less than 1500000 during the years 191017 to 2321566 in 1918 3180150 in 1919 and 4496 082 in 1920 Under judicial are included the federal courts and penal establishments throughout the country the average net expenses of which were 7625586 per year during the tenyear period 191019 increasing very little during this period and 10789974 in 1920 This total includes the salaries of the judges of the Supreme Court circuit and district courts courts of custom and claims salaries and expenses of United States marshals district attor neys and assistant attorneys clerks and bailiff of courts fees of commis sioners jurors and witnesses and the support of prisoners and expenses of federal penitentiaries at Atlanta and Leavenworth The Interstate Commerce Com mission has jurisdiction over the rail roads of the country During the first five years of the tenyear period its expenditures averaged 1499420 per year during the last five years they averaged about 5003363 per year The difference was largely owing to the valuation of the railways in the latter period In 1920 net expenses were 5750470 No one doubts the neces sity for the work of this Commission and it certainly should be done thor oughly and by competent engineers economists and railway experts The Commission has built up a very fine organization pays much better salaries than most branches of the government services employing engineers and other technically trained men and is giving a useful demonstration of the advantages to the government service of a suitable salary scale and adequate funds to pay salaries and expenses The Federal Trade Commission like the Interstate Commerce Com mission is independent of all execu tive departments It was created in 1914 and replaced the Bureau of Corporations of the Department of Commerce It investigates the or ganization and management of cor porations with respect to possible violation of antitrust laws through price discrimination unfair methods of competition or otherwise it also investigates trade conditions in for eign countries with respect to com binations affecting the foreign trade of the United States The Bureau of Cor porations expended 216272 per year for the first six years 191015 the Federal Trade Commission expended an average of 782389 for the four years 191619 increasing from 369 950 in 1916 to 1552244 in 1919 and being 1019446 in 1920 These appear to be very moderate sums if not indeed very inadequate sums for such important work A part of the expenses of the District of Columbia that is the city of Wash ington the Capitol of the Nation is96 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN

Extraordinary expenses item 49 covers expenses incident to bringing home Americans at the outbreak of the war war risk insurance on ships in 1915 and 1916 and the amount expended for the centennial celebration of Perrys victory on Lake Erie All the functions performed under the 49 headings of group I legislative executive and judicial very imperfectly sketched in the preceding pages cost the people during this tenyear period an average of 107 per year per capita of the population of the country In comparison with the cost of state and city government it is surprisingly small In 1920 however for reasons which we shall see later the cost was nearly double this average and it is not un likely to become still larger Group II Research Education and Development The United States Government is carrying on a very considerable amount of scientific and engineering work through a large number of bureaus located in several different depart ments The Agricultural Department is sometimes spoken of as the greatest scientific institution in the world The Geological Survey the Bureau of Mines the Bureau of Standards and other bureaus are well and favorably known for their scientific and engi neering work The importance and economic value of such work is appre ciated only by engineers and others who have been brought into intimate contact with such work Our industries and our civilization are largely based on science and its manifold applica tions realized in practice through the various branches of engineering That the government should foster science and engineering and cooiperate with and develop the industries by means of scientific and engineering research is very generally admitted The extent to which it should go however will of course depend upon the returns secured for such work and whether it appears profitable and helpful and on the whole necessary Figure 7 shows the average annual expenses and earnings in black of the various bureaus and other agencies included in group II The fifteen bureaus of the Agricul tural Department constitute the first half of group II This work is of fundamental importance not only to farmers and agricultural communities but to the entire population An abundant supply of food is essential to the welfare and even existence of the nation and as the urban population increases more rapidly than the rural the food problem becomes more serious Agriculture is the most important industry of the nation Agricultural and animal products amounted possi bly to twentyfive billion dollars last year Food has risen in price in recent years along with other products partly because of higher wages and higher cost of machinery and supplies used by farmers but largely because the urban population has increased faster than the rural and the demand for food products has increased faster than the supply It is of prime importance to city dwellers that food products be produced in greater quantity and this requires an increased efficiency or an increased rural population or both The Agricultural Department carries on a wide range of educational and ex perimental work in order to increase the production of farm products and to promote the interest of the farmer in his work as well as to make life on the farm and in rural communities more attractive This not only beneEXPENDITURES AND

followede8 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY fits the farmer but tends to keep food prices within reason for city dwellers It is therefore serving all the people and its work was never so much needed as at the present time It is spending in this work not over 100 for every 1000 of value of agricultural and animal products and without doubt the results achieved pay many times the cost The work of the Forest Serv ice which is nearly selfsupporting is akin to that of the Public Works and is described in connection with group III The research work in agriculture is of great importance and absorbing interest The Geological Survey is one of the oldest of our scientific bureaus and has done notable work of the greatest scien tific and economic value It includes besides structural and economic geol ogy topographic surveys and studies of water supply and water power The Bureau of Mines is an outgrowth of the Geological Survey and is concerned with all the problems of mining and quarrying and the handling and treat ment of their products and also many phases of the petroleum and natural gas industry and the use of fuels These materials are fundamental to the industries and work which helps the production of fuels and such im portant raw materials as metals and minerals is of prime importance These two bureaus are concerned with the mineral industries of the country coal iron copper and the other industrial and precious metals oil gas and the water supply and the topography of the land Our country is rich in these natural resources but we are spending them in prodigal fashion It is the business of these two bureaus to survey and map the distri bution of metals and minerals to look for new sources of supply to gather statistics and to increase safety and efficiency in the mining and metallurgi cal industries and to consider what can be done to conserve these natural resources which unlike the products of agriculture are not reproduced in an nual cycles but when once used can never be replaced The products of the mineral industries of the country amount possibly to six billions of dollars per year They are indis pensable to our manufacturers and a most important part of our national wealth If these two bureaus were to spend in this important work of re search and development an amount equal to one dollar in a thousand of the annual value of mineral products it would amount possibly to six million dollars per year which is more than double present expenditures Can there be any doubt that such a sum expended in the interest of the public that pays the entire cost and must bear the burdens of any ineffi ciency that exists in the industries would be amply repaid For example millions of dollars are worse than wasted every year in accidents that could be prevented Mining is one of the most hazardous of industries The Bureau of Mines has done a great deal of valuable work both in research and education to make mining safer but there is need for a great deal more than it has been able to do The results of such work are available in all the states where mining is carried on It can generally be done better and far more economically than if done by the states unaided by the Federal Govern ment These two bureaus are doing a work of great economic importance at a cost to the people of this country of three cents per capita per year If it were doubled the burden would be only slightly increased but the service rendered in the increased efficiency of production and fewer accidents and more intelligent use of our natural resources would be very considerableEXPENDITURES AND REVENUES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 99 TABLE 4 AVERAGE ANNUAL NET EXPENDITURESALL CIVIL ACTIVITIES FISCAL YEARS 19101919 Per Cent Net Amount of Total Civil GROUP

Government in doing efficiently what is needed by all The Bureau of Education has done important and useful work but has never been developed on a scale com mensurate with the importance of its field It is believed by many that the Bureau of Education should take a leading part in studying the science of education and coSperate effectively with the educational institutions of the30 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY country in setting standards of educa tion It would not and could not dominate or control education and there would be no danger of such a result But it should be able to cooiper ate effectively and worthily and to assist in raising educational standards where they are too low The Federal Government is now assisting the states to the extent of a hundred million dollars a year in the building of high ways Why should it not assist in the supremely important work of education by taking a leading part in studying the problems of education Four bureaus of the Department of Commerce are included in group II The Coast and Geodetic Survey is one of the oldest branches of the govern ment doing scientific and technical work and until the establishment of the Bureau of Standards kept the standards and did the testing of weights and measures It is charged with the survey of the coasts and rivers to the head of ship navigation and the pub lication of charts giving the results of base measurements triangulation topo graphic and hydrographic surveys deep sea soundings and temperature mag netic observations gravity research determination of heights latitude longitude and reference points for state surveys This work which is very fundamental and important and upon which all other surveys are based has been done with a high order of precision and thoroughness and with marked credit to the government The object of the Bureau of Fisheries is to develop the production and con sumption of fish as an important source of food To stimulate produc tion scientific research on the habits and propagation of fish is carried on The breeding of fish and their distri bution into lakes and streams is done on a large scale In all of this work but particularly in connection with the propagation of fish and the protection of fish against extermination the bu reau cooperates with the various states The responsibility of the government for work of this kind is obvious and there can be no doubt as to its being profitable The Bureau of Standards maintains the fundamental standards of physical measurement It coSperates with foreign governmental institutions in maintaining international uniformity in such measurements It provides or calibrates copies of standards for states and manufacturers so as to insure uni formity in physical measurements It develops instruments and methods to secure the highest possible accuracy in measurements and the greatest perma nence and reliability in standards It co6perates with engineering and trade organizations in standardization work and carries out investigations on the properties of materials to secure data for such standardization A very large amount of work is done for the Army and Navy and other branches of the Federal Government for state com missions and officers of state and municipal governments and the general public It also carries out a large amount of scientific and industrial research to develop the industries of the country Excluding food prod ucts tobacco and liquors the annual value of manufactured products in this country over and above the value of the raw materials entering into them is possibly 12000000000 The Bureau of Standards spends this year a sum not more than ten cents per 1000 of manufactured products in all its work and scarcely more than one half of it is for the purpose of develop ing these manufactures If this sum could be considerably increased it would enable a much larger amount of work to be done and the work could be carried on more efficiently If it wereEXPENDITURES AND REVENUES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 31 multiplied by ten it would be none too much and would enable the gov ernment to do for the manufacturing industries something like what it is doing for agriculture In view of the enormous inportance of developing the manufacturing industries of the coun try and also in view of the large amount of money collected from these industries in taxes it seems reasonable to expect the government to allot a more generous sum to this work One cent per year per capita of the countrys population for this construc tive and wealthproducing work is a very small amount for so important a work The Bureau of the Census does a large amount of statistical work in addition to taking the decennial census of the population agriculture manu factures mines and quarries It is charged with collecting statistics at specified intervals regarding depend ent defective and delinquent classes wealth taxation state and municipal revenues and expenditures and many other subjects This work is of great importance and is properly included in the research and educational group The Bureau of Labor Statistics gathers the statistics of wages in the various industries and the cost of living and publishes much valuable material of interest to labor and capi tal The prosperity and happiness of all the people depend to a considerable extent upon industrial peace and freedom from strikes and disorder Industrial peace and contentment re quire justice and fair dealing between employers and employed In order that both may know what is just and fair statistical information as to wages and changes in prices and the cost of living is essential It is probable that the greatest obstacle to a good under standing between employers and em ployed is lack of information Sus picion and prejudice often give way to sympathy and understanding when full information including information about what others are doing is made available The good results achieved by generous treatment of labor should be put before all employers and if the government would spend more on research and education in this impor tant field might it not save much that is now spent in other directions And might not the public be saved much both in expense and inconvenience that results from industrial warfare This subject is of such tremendous and far reaching importance that one is led to ask whether the government is doing as much as it should in this connection The work of the Childrens Bureau and the Woman in Industry service is relatively new but of great importance In the interest of the state apart from considerations of humanity women and children should be protected in the industries and the work of these two bureaus is therefore of fundamental importance It seems likely that it will grow rapidly in magnitude and occupy a larger place in the publics thought The Library of Congress is a great national institution corresponding to the British Museum and the Biblio theque Nationale It is properly grouped with the educational institu tions of the government and it is an institution of which all Americans are proud It is a great library housed in a beautiful building useful to thou sands enjoyed by hundreds of thou sands The country approves a gener ous policy toward this activity of the government devoted as it is to art and education The Smithsonian Institution and the National Museum are national institu tions devoted to science industry art and natural history The Smithsonian Institution has a private endowment32 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY but the greater portion of its funds comes from the government It carries out scientific researches in the physical and natural sciences and has extremely valuable collections in its museums and art galleries The government has not done as much in promoting art and collecting works of art as have many other governments and it is to be hoped that much may be done in the future to compensate for past neglect in these matters The Public Health Service is one of the most important of the agencies doing work of research and education It maintains supervision over incoming vessels to prevent the introduction of diseases to prevent the spread of diseases between the states it makes inspections and cobperates with the state departments of health statistics of diseases are collected and inter preted and scientific research is carried out to develop methods of preventing the spread of disease The service has recently formulated a comprehensive health program to be carried out on a nationwide scale by the active cobperation of federal state and local authorities and voluntary organizations That these needs are urgent is shown by the fact that more than onethird of all men examined under the draft during the war were rejected for physical defects and diseases The Surgeon General states that in large measure these defects and diseases could have been prevented had proper attention been given to them especially in childhood This unsatisfactory condition of the public health shows the need of greater atten tion on the part of the Federal Gov ernment and more systematic co5per ation between local and national agencies A large amount of most valuable medical statistical and research work is carried on by the Public Health Service which has been greatly devel oped in recent years The oppor tunities presented in this work for growth and increased usefulness are almost boundless In addition to its work in connection with the public health a large amount of work is done in the care and rehabilitation of sick and wounded soldiers The foregoing brief outline of the activities of the various government agencies included in group II gives a very incomplete statement of the research and educational work done by the government It is however in tended to convey some idea of the wide range and important character of this work and its great possibilities for development if more adequate pro vision could be made for its support The Great War was based very largely on science and engineering During the twentyfive years preced ing the outbreak of the war the enemy had developed science and the practi cal applications of science in a wonder ful way He had fostered the indus tries developed shipping and foreign trade and promoted scientific research and education until the German nation stood in the forefront of the nations of the earth When the war began the Allied nations were unprepared not only for lack of armies and munitions but for lack of industrial equipment transportation facilities and scientific development Holding the enemy at bay under fearful odds while they built up their armies and their industries the Allied and associated powers utilized all the resources of science and engi neering and a vast amount of accumu lated treasure to make good their initial deficiencies and gain strength enough to wear out and overcome the enemy In this titanic struggle scientists engineers and captains of industry were mobilized by the tens of thou sands and men and women in the inEXPENDITURES AND REVENUES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 33 dustries by the tens of millions in order that the soldiers and sailors in the armies and the fleets might be adequately supplied with food muni tions and equipment The wonderful achievements of science under the pressure of necessity demonstrated the economic possibilities of scientific re search This demonstration was not altogether new but the war brought it home more forcefully and at its close one felt that never again would any body question the importance and eco nomic value of scientific investigation Almost before the war is over how ever and indeed before peace with the enemy is officially declared we find some of the governments scientific work seriously handicapped for lack of funds and a feeling by many people that under present circumstances such work must be severely curtailed for the sake of economy It therefore seems timely to take this survey of the fields of the governments activities which are included in group II and to see how much or how little relatively is expended for this work The average cost of all this work for the tenyear period 191019 as shown in table 5 was 28 cents per year per capita of the countrys popula tion certainly a very small sum in proportion to the importance of the interests represented and also in proportion to the aggregate of the federal taxes collected Group III Public Works New Construction The Panama Canal was opened to navigation in 1914 Its total cost for construction and equipment to date is 367000000 During the past six years its revenues have amounted to about 34000000 and its expenditures for operation and maintenance to 36000000 a net deficit of 2000000 for the entire period Had it not been for the slides in 1916 which closed the canal for seven months and greatly re duced the revenue that year there would have been a surplus of 9000 000 for the entire period instead of a deficit The surplus in the fiscal year 1920 amounted to more than 2000 000 and this should increase year by year More than 910000000 out of the total cost of 367000000 was pro vided out of current revenues of the government from 1910 to 1915 and hence was included in the 914 per capita of civil governmental cost dur ing these years This is one of the engineering triumphs of the present century and is another illustration of the successful handling of large public undertakings by the people co6pera tively that is by the government Another large undertaking of an engineering character is the river and harbor improvements carried out by the engineers of the army but charged in this study to Public Works During the ten years 1910 to 1919 inclusive more than 350000000 was expended in this very important work From Hell Gate to the Golden Gate and from Duluth to the delta of the Mississippi this work has been carried on for many years and is of great aggregate im portance A third important item in this group is the construction of new public build ings and during the tenyear period in question 135197494 was expended in the construction of post offices custom houses hospitals and other govern ment buildings about one hundred twenty new buildings per year being erected The work is done by the office of the supervising architect of the Treasury Department which for many years has handled this work This also comes within the total of 214 per capita of civil governmental cost about 79 cents of which was expended in the publicworks group 4TABLE 5 NET CIVIL EXPENSES OF U S GOVERNMENT FISCAL YEARS 19101919 Fiscal Year GROUP I GROUP 11P III TOTAL CIVIL Ending June 30

In addition to the construction of new buildings the supervising architects office has charge of the operation and maintenance of 1300 public buildings in all parts of the country The fourth item in this group is the construction of rural post roads by cotiperation with state highway depart ments This work has been greatly expanded recently During the ten years 1910 to 1919 inclusive 4970 489 was expended in the aggregate But the appropriation for 1920 was 99000000and for 1921104000000 This is more than the annual expendi ture previous to 1990 for the entire range of engineering work included in group III The importance of good roads to the proper development of the country is now well understood and there can be no doubt that the co6ipera tion of the Federal Government will be to the advantage of the people as a whole The building of roads is an en gineering matter in which technical in formation and experience are of very great importance The aid of the Fed eral Government not only stimulates and aids the states which must pay at least half the cost but tends to secure the best engineering service and to standardize road construction It can not fail to have a great educational in fluence upon engineers and road build ers throughout the country and to give the users of roads better roads and the taxpayers more for their money than if it is left to individual states Moreover in planning and building national highways it is very advanta geous to have the Federal Government an active participant in order to secure a better cotirdination of effort As a measure of military precaution and preparedness the realization of a sys tem of good roads on a national scale is of enormous advantage As a help in getting food to market and supplies to farmers it is of enormous economic value As supplementing and in some cases supplanting railroads such a system of highways is of great signif icance The fifth item is the Alaskan Rail way from Seward to Fairbanks Dur ing the years 1913 to 1919 inclusive 31081628 was expended on this im portant railway which when com pleted will be 540 miles long As with the Panama Canal this is not an undertaking which private capital would care to undertake But its ultimate success and its value in the development of Alaska can hardly be doubted The sixth item is the Reclamation Service one of the most profitable and most interesting of the engineering projects of the government To re claim the deserts and to create farms and homes and villages where before was waste and desolation is an in spiring undertaking and to be able to create wealth far in excess of the cost of the work furnishes a double incen tive Since 1902 the Reclamation Service has constructed irrigation sys tems to supply 1780000 acres of land with water and storage reservoirs sufficient to supply an additional million of acres On this reclaimed land 40000 families are living and the population of the towns and villages within these projects had increased by as many more It is estimated that the increased value of the land due to the work of the Reclamation Service is 200 per acre or a total of more than 350000000 The annual value of the crops raised on these lands is estimated at 90000000 Most of the money expended on this work is derived from the sale of public lands and the money collected from settlers for the improvements made and the water service rendered The Forest Service is akin to the Reclamation Service in that it is36 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY TABLE 6 NET EXPENDITUREsGROUP IPRIMARY

generation our public forest areas in better rather than worse condition than they are at present The annual earnings of the Forest Service go a long way usually in pay ing expenses and it is believed that in a few years they will pay the entire cost of the work in addition to adding year by year to the value of the national forests The Federal Power Commission is another agency recently established to38 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY do engineering work akin to the Rec lamation Service and Forest Service in that it is developing the natural re sources of the country and indirectly creating wealth It is different how ever in this important respect that instead of carrying out engineering work itself it has general supervision of power sites and their development and will grant permits to private agencies to carry out such work and supervise the carrying out of the work so that it shall not be inconsistent with the public interest The power prob lem is a very fundamental one and the recent unfortunate experience of the industries and public utilities which depend upon coal emphasizes the need for the government to do what it can to make the water powers of the coun try available to the industries It is to be hoped that the Federal Power Commission will be given such means to work with that it will be enabled to attack the problems before it effectively and successfully All these important constructive activities of the government except the Forest Service as shown in Fig 8 were carried on for the tenyear period at a total cost of 777434500 and an

REGARDING U S EXPENSE FOR RECLAMATION SERVICE In the expenditures and credits of the Reclamation Service as shown in the charts and tables some items do not appear because of certain bookkeeping procedure which the law requires the Treasury to follow in this instance Thus the total amount actually disbursed in 191019 is 97583587 This is 26343545 in excess of the amount shown in table 8 this difference representing the collections during this period from water rights charges on completed projects which by act of Congress the Reclamation Service is permitted to reinvest in new projects In addition to a loan of 20000000 advanced by the Treasury in 1910 the actual credits to the service in the tenyear period amounted to 74127630 The excess of this amount over that shown in the charts and tables consists of 14460 581 from Land Office fees and commissions credited in this study to the Land Service and 26923106 from water right charges and other collections from completed projects The

the countrys population That so much could be done at so slight a burden to each is of course because it is shared by so many And this is the principal argument in much that the Federal Government does particularly in research and development work To do it well once and place the results at the disposal of all is far cheaper as well as better than for separate agen cies to do it separately or to try to do it together without the means for securing effective cooperation Groups IV V and VI Army and Navy Pensions and Special War Activities The importance and necessity of the military departments of the govern ment need no emphasis here That the Army and Navy should be well supported and developed up to a high degree of efficiency is generally con ceded As to how large they should

These groups represent fiscal opera tions and revenues all handled by the Treasury The first group includes in terest which is an item of current expense Item 100 gives interest on the public debt and item 101 in cludes all other interest transactions such as interest paid on trust funds Indian moneys and other funds held by the government in trust and draw ing interest and interest received on loans The latter includes loans to farmers banks railroads and Euro pean governments Group VIII includes transactions not including interest as to public debt loans and trust funds Seign iorage is included here also as it is virtually a loan without interest when it is credited and the liquidation of that loan when it is debited There are some exceptions but this would be the rule and it seemed proper to in clude it in this group Group IX includes the revenues from direct and indirect taxation It has already been explained that the four items 107 to 110 represent all sources of revenue other than earnings from fees fines sale of property inter est etc which are credited to the proper departments or accounts as offsets to expenses or interest paid out Rebates for overpayments or deposits on customs or internal revenue collec tions are deducted from the total so that the sums given are the net revenues In the Treasury accounts as shown in the Combined Statement rebates are charged with other disbursements and the gross revenues from customs and internal revenue taxes are given without deduction for rebates The revenues from various sources for 1920 are plotted in Figure 9 The

its books the same day and hence at the end of the fiscal year there will be a difference in totals which is not the same as at the beginning of the year and also by the fact that the rebates for overpayments have not been deducted Figure 9 is a graphical representation of the 1920 column of Table 11 which gives the receipts from internal revenue customs and tax on national bank circulation

only 15 per cent more than in the prewar years Most of this increase was in the government printing office and considering the increase in the cost of labor and materials during these years this is not a surprising increase Under Executive the increase is mainly due to the heavy increase in the work thrown upon the Civil Serv ice Commission by the war and the growth of the new Bureau of Efficiency The State Department had enor mously increased responsibilities dur ing the war and its average was almost 100 per cent above the prewar average In the Treasury item 12 administra tive increased very largely This how ever included additional compensa tion to all employes of the Treasury The Internal Revenue more than doubled in cost the Coast Guard increased 60 per cent the Bureau of Engraving and Printing increased nearly 25 per cent and the total ex cluding those parts of the Treasury included in groups II III and V in creased 46 per cent Loans and currency show a decrease in net ex pense due to unusually large earnings during the war The average increase in the net expenditures of that part of the Interior Department included in group I during the war was 20 per cent Onehalf of this increase was in item 25 the Indian Service and the other half in all other it6ms and was largely due to the increased compensation of employes The Patent Office earned a surplus almost as large as before the war The Post Office Department had a considerable surplus in each of the three war years the average being 8156550 Inthe seven prewar years the average net cost deficit of the Post Office Department including overhead management was 4189 546 That makes a difference of over twelve million dollars a year in the balance sheet in comparison with pre war years and offsets a considerable part of the extra cost of group I in the war period The Department of Agriculture ex pended on the activities included in group I 49 per cent more than the average of the seven prewar years This was however a gradual growth being only 20 per cent more than 1915 and 10 per cent more than 1916 The activities of the Department of Commerce included in group I in creased in cost by 22 per cent over the prewar average but only 15 per cent over the average of 1915 and 1916 The Bureau of Navigation was more than self supporting due to the large number of fees collected The principal part of the Department of Labor included in group I is the Immigration Service Before the war owing to a very large immigration it earned a surplus During the war when immigration was greatly reduced its earnings fell to about onefourth of those of 1913 and 1914 and the average net expense of the department was 2464156 per year instead of an average surplus of 391433 as it was before the war The

railways which began in the latter part of the prewar period The total for group I averaged 97718290 in the seven prewar years and 124509073 during the war an increase of 26 per cent More than half of this increase was in the Treasury Department Compared with the average of 1915 and 1916 the increase in total was only 12 per cent That is partly accounted for by the normal growth of the government partly by increased war activities and partly by increased cost of supplies and wages in the later years Although it is reduced appreciably by the surplus of the Post Office comparison of costs with those of private business would show that these figures for the govern ment are exceedingly moderate less than one might have expected Group II Half of the thirtyone services listed in group II are in the Agricultural Department The aver age expenditure for the activities of this department which are included in group II was 11528858 per year during the seven prewar years and 16033566 per year for the three war years an increase of 39 per cent The Forest Service had a much smaller net expense during the war than before owing to the very large earnings see table 15 The Bureau of Animal Industry increased 29 per cent over the prewar average although it was no increase over 1916 and only half of what was spent in 1915 During these two years five million dollars was ap propriated for the eradication of foot and mouth and other contagious ani mal diseases Similarly the Bureau of Plant Industry expended in the war years 23 per cent more than in the average of the seven prewar years but no more than 1915 and 1916 The States Relation Service succeeded the Agricultural Experiment Stations in 1915 and this work has since that time greatly increased The average ex penditure during the six years 1910 to 1915 was slightly more than one and a half millions of dollars per year In 1916 it was 2607013 and during the three war years it averaged 2840 113 Cooiperative Agricultural Ex tension work began in 1915 with an expenditure of 480000 In 1916 it spent 1074935 and during the three war years it averaged 2076081 Markets and Rural organizations be gan in 1914 and averaged 158393 in 1914 1915 and 1916 and 754155 in the three war years The Weather Bureau averaged 1432217 during the war years being slightly less than during the preceding seven years Nearly all the remaining bureaus of the Agricultural Department increased their expenditures during the war years as compared with prewar years Entomology increased 35 per cent Chemistry 53 per cent Biological Sur vey 238 per cent Public Roads and Rural Engineering 23 per cent Soils 43 per cent and the remaining mis cellaneous activities items 6265 74 per cent In the Interior Department the Geological Survey increased its ex penditure during the war years by 14 per cent over the average of the prewar years the Bureau of Mines newly es tablished in 1910 164 per cent and the Bureau of Education and Howard University together 12 per cent the total for the department having in creased 50 per cent or 10 per cent per year on the average for the five years between the middle of the two periods In the Department of Commerce the Coast and Geodetic Survey increased its expenditures during the war years about 11 per cent over the average of the prewar years the Bureau of Stand ards a relatively new and growing bureau 92 per cent the Bureau of62 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY Fisheries 4 per cent while the Bureau of the Census decreased largely owing to the fact that the Census of 1910 was included in the earlier period The Census expended during the three war years an average of 1122000 per year which was slightly less than dur ing the years 1914 1915 1916 The total for the department was on the average nearly a million dollars a year less during the war than before but omitting the extra cost of the census of 1910 there was a small increase In the Public Health Service the expenditures in the war years increased 81 per cent over the average of the seven prewar years The Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Childrens Bureau both in the Department of Labor were organized in 1913 and started very small so that the percent age increase was relatively large being 63 per cent for the first and 221 per cent for the second The net expenses of the Library of Congress averaged 491657 during the seven prewar years and 528425 during the three war years an increase of 75 per cent The Smithsonian Institution and the National Museum averaged 658519 during the three war years which was 65822 less than the average during the prewar period The expenditures for Colleges of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts amounted to 2000000 in 1910 2250000 in 1911 and since then it has been 2500000 every year The Fed eral Board for Vocational Education was in operation only during 1918 and 1919 and its expenditures were 1 412883 in 1918 and 1548017 in 1919 National and District of Columbia Parks and the Botanical Gardens cost 316637 on the average during the seven prewar years and 773116 dur ing the three war years The total for group II was 25329 398 on the average for the prewar years and 33692610 per year for the three war years an increase of 33 per cent Group III In group III there were considerable reductions in several items during the war period partly because of the war and partly because the Panama Canal was very nearly com pleted by 1915 For River and Harbor improvements the expenditures averaged 37759755 during the prewar period and dropped to an average of 29643095 during the war period For Panama Canal construction the expenditures averaged 28133498 during the prewar period and only 5835581 during the war period This does not include operat ing expenses or earnings during the five years 1915 to 1919 of this time when it was open to traffic these are included in group I New construc tion of public buildings cost 14583 141 per year during the prewar period and 11038504 per year during the war This does not include any of the work of the Bureau of Housing and Transportation a strictly war activ ity which is in group VI item 98 Rural post and forest roads had 265327 in 1915 the only prewar year in which anything was spent under this heading In 1917 there was spent 34994 in 1918 843474 and in 1919 3826694 For the Alaska Railway there was expended a total of 706 212 during 1913 1914 and 1915 and 4148011 in 1916 During the next three years the average expenditure was 8742468 The Reclamation Service expended 4201152 on an average during the seven prewar years and 3029344 per year during the three war years above its earnings from rent als water rights and receipts from the sale of land This includes a loan from the government of 20000000 which is to be repaid beginning this year See footnote to table 8 The total expenditures for group IIIEXPENDITURES AND REVENUES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 63 averaged 85408910 during the pre war period and 59857380 per year during the war period The total expenditures for the three civil groups I II and III averaged 208456528 during the seven prewar years and 218059063 per year during the three war years an increase of slightly less than 5 per cent in the five years between the middle of those two periods The population of the country increased during the same time nearly 8 per cent so that the average rate of increase of the total expense of the three civil groups was about half as great as the rate of increase of population The increase of cost of materials and labor was of course considerable while there was a considerable growth in many bureaus and other branches of the government and the inauguration of some new ones and also a very great increase of functions and cost in some cases due to the war However the reduction in the construction work in cluded in group III and the surplus during the war of the post office nearly counterbalanced these increases so that the average per capita cost of the three civil groups was actually a little less during the war years than before In the military groups the increase during the war was of course very large For the War Department the net ex penditures averaged 122557833 per year during the seven prewar years and 5084199160 per year during the three war years exclusive of the armament and fortifications of the Panama Canal and the care of the war and navy build ings For the Navy Department the net expenditures averaged 132388 753 before the war and 1213377684 during the war The total of group IV increased from 256971389 per year to 6302322105 per year the latter being nearly twentyfive times theformer More details of the expend itures in the War and Navy Depart ments for the period 191019 are given in

moneys advanced to Indians of various tribes in previous years that is loans to help them estab lish themselves These sums were charged to the Indian Service but were made with the understanding that64 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY they were to be reimbursed without interest The large item credited in 1911 was mainly due to a sinking fund that had been accumulating in the Treasury for many years to repay ad vances to the Chippewa Indians of Minnesota and which was transferred in 1911 to the general fund This does not include the Indians trust fund account which is in item 106 Interior Miscellaneous includes reg isters receivers and copying fees of the General Land Office proceeds of town sites from the Reclamation Serv ice depredations on public lands sales of public

the largest credits have been from assessments on federal reserve banks for salaries and expenses of the Federal Reserve Board For example in 1919 this was 2614778 In 1915 and 1916 there was a large credit under item 49 being reimbursement to the government for money advanced to American citizens to assist them in returning from Europe at the out break of the European war In 1915 this reimbursement was 1774465 and in 1916 it was 951285 or a total of 2725750 being 85 per cent of the amount disbursed for this purpose in 1915 The totals of credits for group I average 28065624 per year for the tenyear period As stated above these credits have been deducted from the gross expenditures of the depart ments and bureaus to get the net expenses but are given here separately in order to show what the earnings and credits are and how they have varied from year to year In group II the credits for Agricul ture are almost entirely those of the Forest Service for the sale of timber and the use of grazing lands and for other receipts from the national forests There are also included small receipts from the sale of products of experiment stations of item 53 Interior credits are mainly sales of maps and other government property by the Geological Survey and fees collected by the Bureau of Mines Commerce includes sales of sealskins and fox skins by the Bureau of Fish eries and fees of the Bureau of Stand ards The largest item in the miscel laneous group 7380 is the fees of the Library of Congress for the copy right office and the sales of index cards The total earnings of group II average 3415755 per year for the tenyear periodEXPENDITURES AND REVENUES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 65 Expenditures of 192o We have seen that the increase of net expenses of the three civil groups taken together during the three war years was only 5 per cent over the aver age of the seven years of the prewar period groups I and II being greater by 26 and 33 per cent respectively but group III considerably less In 1920 however expenditures increased very greatly group I being 128 per cent greater than in prewar years group II 118 per cent greater and group III al most exactly the same the three groups taken together increasing 75 per cent Group IV however was five and a quarter times as great in 1920 as the prewar average which is an increase of 425 per cent and group V increased 100 per cent Group VI can not be compared with theprewar period inas much as its activities did not exist be fore the war but adding the three military groups together and comparing with the prewar expenditures we find them to be 3312849587 as against 422515824 before the war an in crease of 684 per cent Group VII interest on the public debt less interest received and less discount on bonds purchased in 1920 was 929131128 as against 23605213 before the war the former being nearly 40 times the latter figure Revenues from taxation increased nearly nine times Comparing 1920 with the average of the three war years group I is 80 per cent greater group II is 70 per cent greater and group III is 42 per cent greater The principal causes of increase in group I are 1 the great expansion in certain of the activities of the govern ment due to the war such as the In ternal Revenue Service and State Department 2 the large deficit in the Post Office Department in 190 caused by increased compensations to em ployes and the railroads as contrasted with a considerable surplus during the war years 3 the bonus paid to civil employes in other departments to par tially compensate for the increased cost of living and which during the war years had been on the average very small 4 the increased cost of all kinds of materials and supplies and of trans portation and 5 the normal growth of the government and the recovery from the abnormal restriction of growth in some cases during the war years The excess of 1920 for group I over the average of the war years is 99601 521 Taking the largest items first the difference for the Post Office De partment is 46182746 and for the Treasury Department 32363049 to gether amounting to over 78 millions leaving only921millions to be accounted for in all the other departments In item 12 of the Treasury the difference of 10 million dollars is largely explained by increase of compensation to em ployes to cover the increased cost of living this item covering all the em ployes of the Treasury Department except in the Bureau of War Risk Insurance The number of employes of the Treasury has increased very greatly and the increase of compensa tion for 1920 was 240 instead of 120 as it had been in 1919 The total amount paid for this purpose was about seven times the average of the three war years The Internal Rev enue Service increased greatly in 1990 over 1919 and of course still more over the average of 19171919 amounting to 155 millions over the latter Other activities of the Treasury also increased and the difference of 32 millions is made up as shown in table 14 The 21 millions increase in other de partments is made up of 37 millions in Legislative 03 in Executive 33 in State 23 in Interior 28 in Agriculture 53 in Commerce more than half o 666 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY which was in the Bureau of Light Houses11 in Labor that is the net expenses of the Department of Labor were reduced owing to increased earn ings from increased immigration 21 in Justice 26 in Judicial03 in mis cellaneous that is the miscellaneous group was slightly less because of the large earnings of the Panama Canal in 1920 The increased compensation in the Post Office and in all other depart ments and the greatly increased force required to collect the war revenue to gether with the fact that compensation and development had been kept down abnormally during the war account for the greater part of the excess in 1920 over the average of the war years In a later section it will be shown that the number of employes in the civil depart ments had increased in 1920 over 1916 by only a very small per cent outside of the Treasury and State Departments and hence this increase was not due to an excess of employes in those depart ments In group II the excess of 1920 over the average of the three war years was 252 millions Of this amount 74 millions is in Agriculture 130 millions in Commerce 33 millions in miscella neous the Interior Department being unchanged The principal increases in Agriculture were 17 millions in the Forest Service which was abnormally small during the war on account of very large revenues from timber cut 10 million in Animal Industry 24 mil lions in Co6perative Agricultural Ex tension Work and 04 million each in Plant Industry Markets and Ento mology In Commerce 125 millions of the total increase of 130 millions was due to the census of 1920 The Coast Survey and the Bureau of Standards had increases of 07 and 05 millions respectively and the Bureau of Fish eries a decrease of 07 due to very large earnings from the sale of seal skins and other furs in 1920 The Public Health Service increased 15 millions the Federal Board for Vocational Education increased 13 millions over the average of the three war years but only 08 over the average of the two years when it was operating and other services had small increases although the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Childrens Bureau were both less than the average of the three war years In group III there were large in creases in some items and decreases in others the total being 252 millions more than the average during the war For Rivers and Harbors the increase was 178 millions and highway con struction was 235 millions more Panama Canal construction was 48 millions less public buildings 45 mil lions less Alaska Railway 25 millions less and Reclamation Service 43 mil lions less It is scarcely worth while to compare the expenditures of the military de partments in 1920 with the war period the conditions being so different and we have already compared them with the prewar period If one recalls the enormous increase in prices of commodities and the in creased cost of doing business outside the government service during 1919 and 1920 with the increases shown above for all the civil activities of the government and recalls that a large amount of work has been added to the latter which in a strict accounting study would have been charged to the mili tary departments such as the cost of collecting the revenue to support the latter and pay for the war one must admit that these increases are very moderate indeed So far from justify ing the charges of extravagance some times made they show either economyEXPENDITURES AND REVENUES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 67 or curtailment of service or both This is not saying that there is no ex travagance or that there is no lack of efficiency If in the large sum paid for the increase of compensation of em ployes there had been included some 5As an instance of economy it may be men tioned that government employes civil are allowed 400 per day for subsistence when trav eling or actual expenses not to exceed 500 per day the same as was allowed 20 years ago when the cost of living when traveling was scarcely more than half what it is now and this applies also to the higher officers of the government when on the most important departmental business thing for the higher positions in the executive departments of the govern ment the salaries of which in most cases have been increased very little in twenty years there would have been fewer losses of able and experienced men and a higher average of adminis tration6 With better management 6 The increase of compensation of 120 per year in 1919 and 240 in 1920 to cover the increased cost of living applied to positions of 2500 per year and less no allowance of the kind was made for the positions at higher salaries in which the turnover has been very great PER CAPITA TAXATION COMPARED WITH

was 5346 and the three civil groups expended 345 per capita or 65 per cent The total expenditures of course differed from these figures for revenue from taxa tion as shown in table 1 The pur pose in this exhibit is to call attention to the fact that the civil expenses absorb a relatively small part of the total revenue derived from taxation especially in recent years and that they increased very little until 1920 Attention should be called to the fact shown in the figure that the expenses of groups I and II did increase appreci ably during the tenyear period 1910 19 but that the construction work of group III was considerably reduced in the later years of this period so that the total remained nearly constant The average taxation throughout the fortyeight states of the union in 1918 for state governmental purposes amounted to 450 per capita The Bureau of the Census has made an investigation of the costs of munici pal government in a large number of the cities of the country having a population of 30000 or more and of taxation and other revenues of such cities The results have been classi fied and tabulated in such a way as to facilitate study and comparison and it is instructive to compare them with the expenses of the various agencies of the Federal Government The three larg est cities of the country New York Chi cago and Philadelphia have been taken for illustration Their combined popu lation in 1918 was slightly over ten millions or onetenth of the population of the entire country Their total expenses for various purposes for the 7 Financial Statistics of Cities1918

earnings from public service enterprises fines gifts and pension assessments and borrowed money and 3022 per capita is col lected from taxes Fig 18 This is less than the federal per capita tax in 1918 but more than ten times as much as federal per capita expenditures for the three civil groups The amount spent for education schools colleges and libraries in these three cities was nearly double that which was spent by the Federal Government in 1918 for research education and public health work group II whereas the amount spent for all purposes was more than was spent for all the civil groups of the entire Federal Government For all cities of more than 30000 population the average per capita of taxes collected in 1918 for municipal purposes is 2514 and the average of expenditures 2655 Table

payments for all the state governments of the coun try for the five years 191519 inclusive together with their population and per capita expense and revenue It will be noticed that interest receipts ex ceeded interest payments so that the item of interest appears under earnings instead of expense The net per capita expenses varied between 400 and 473 the per capita tax revenues increased in this period from 374 to 506 Review of the Functions of Federal and State Governments Referring back now to the functions of government as outlined at the begin ning let us consider to what extent the Federal Government is doing the things that would naturally fall to it in the division of functions between federal and state activity including in the latter the activities of municipalities which are creatures of the state a Under protective functions 1 protection from invasion or encroach ment from without is mainly a federal function and has always been performed adequately in this country and at great cost 2 Protection of life property and reputation is largely a function of the separate states but many agencies of the government are concerned with safety and the protection of life and property The Bureau of Lighthouses Bureau of Navigation Steamboat In spection Service Division of Safety of the Interstate Commerce Commission the life saving service of the Coast Guard the safety divisions of the Bureau of Mines and the Bureau of Standards the Department of Justice and other branches of the government carry on work of this kind of great practical value although in some cases it is small in comparison with what needs to be done It is believed that such work amply justifies itself and should be developed and made even more effective 3 Protection against the spread of disease is divided between the Federal Government and the states and in recent years the Public Health Service and the Agricultural Depart ment have been given larger means and have done more work of this kind than before although in the aggregate the states do the greater portion of what is done The need and the opportunity are so great and the interests at stake so vast that a few cents per capita of the countrys population per year seem no adequate measure of what ought to be done by the Federal Government It would appear to be a very proper and profitable investment for the Federal Government to increase sub stantially its research and coopera tion with state and private medical agencies in order to give greater re turns in service to the people for taxes collected and to promote the well being of the nation b Under the commercial functions of government the most conspicuous examples of such activities carried on by the Federal Government are the Post Office Shipping Board Panama Canal Patent Office and Reclamation Service The Alaskan Railway is not yet completed while the War Risk In surance is not primarily commercial although it is perhaps midway between commercial insurance and a pension system Aside from the activities of the Shipping Board which is compara tively new and grew out of the necessi ties of the war all these commercial activities have been substantially self supporting and have undoubtedly rendered a very valuable public service The Post Office is one of the most792 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY indispensable and successful of federal activities and nobody would suggest that it be handled by a private com pany the Panama Canal is a great engineering achievement and has so far met all commercial expectations the Patent Office is operated at a profit but is far from satisfactory from the standpoint of service and is asking to be strengthened and made more effec tive as it deserves to be the Reclama tion Service is doing a great work and while ultimately selfsupporting is not as yet quite on a commercial basis The Federal Government has much to be proud of in connection with this group of services and while doubtless many improvements in management are possible it is believed that a careful study would justify larger rather than smaller outlays with a view to better and more adequate service The states and cities carry on many commercial enterprises including vari ous public utilities and with varying degrees of success c Under the developmental func tions of government there are five subheadings 1 Public education is carried on mainly by the states munici palities and private agencies the Fed eral Government assuming compara tively small responsibility and incurring small expense There is great need for research in education and for cobipera tion among all the agencies concerned and many believe that the Federal Government should do a great deal more in this direction than it does 2 Public recreation is aided by the Federal Government through the main tenance of national parks which have also an educational value this func tion however is exercised almost wholly by state and local governments 3 Providing those legal and admin istrative conditions in which private business will be conducted in a just and equitable manner covers a wide range of governmental activity both federal and state The supervision of banking by the Treasury the work of the Federal Trade Commission regula tions regarding interstate commerce some of the activities of the Post Office Department and the Department of Justice are all included under this head Generally the states exercise local jurisdiction the Federal Govern ment concerning itself with interstate and foreign business 4 Investiga tion and control of public utilities is very largely the function of the separate states except that for the railroads of the country it has come to be largely a federal function The Federal Government cobperates to some extent with the states in studying the many problems of the other public utilities When private companies render a public service for which the public pays the entire cost plus a profit to the company the public should have suitable standards for judging the qual ity of the service and should know whether the business is conducted efficiently Otherwise there is no pro tection to the public and great proba bility that in many cases it will not be so conducted The problems are much the same in all the states and cities and can be studied cobperatively to great advantage The commercial companies have their associations for mutual benefit and cobperation and the states have their readiest means of cooperation with one another through the Federal Government This is one of the greatest opportunities for use fulness to the people and ought to be improved far more than it ever has been 5 Developing the resources and wealth of the state and cobperating with the industries in research and standardization is one of the most important functions of the Federal Government Partly for the purpose of developing wealth which can beEXPENDITURES AND REVENUES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 73 taxed or replacing by constructive service the wealth which is absorbed by the government in taxes and partly for the purpose of benefiting society and strengthening the state this work should be developed and extended It is like good seed to a farmer which yields large returns on its extra cost and without which the best success is impossible It thus appears that these functions of the Federal Government which are devel opmental as distinguished from govern mental are susceptible of great extension the idea not of control but of service being emphasized Herein lies the possibility of notable advances in popu lar government without conflicting with the rights or responsibilities of states or municipalities or with private initiative The Employment Policy of the Government How to increase efficiency in the government service is an important question and nobody is more interested in it than those in the service The problem is not merely how to reduce expenses or how to get a cheaper government but rather how to get the maximum of service and the best government possible for a given ex penditure The United States Government may be likened to a great business organi zation of which Congress is the Board of Directors and the taxpayers are the stockholders It is a great coiperative undertaking for the benefit of all the citizens of the United States and it suffers some of the difficulties of cobper ative undertakings The various de partments bureaus and other branches of the government are managed by secretaries directors division chiefs and various assistants the chief execu tive officer over all being the President There are altogether several thousand men in responsible administrative posi tions in the governments complex organization who are concerned with problems of administration and busi ness management and who at the present time are specially interested in the improvement of the employment policy of the government There are several hundred thousand employes of the government who are not only interested in this question but vitally concerned and are calling the atten tion of Congress and the public to the fact that the governments employ ment policy needs revision and bring ing up to date In the government service even more than in private business ad ministration should be reasonable and just and administrators competent and efficient Officers should be held responsible for results and should be given sufficient authority and means to work with so that there can be no excuse for failure or for inefficiency The question therefore isWhat changes in the employment policy of the government should be made in order that the government service may be put on a very high plane that it shall offer so attractive a career that able men and women may be secured and the best retained in the service and that it shall rank with the very best organizations anywhere in the in tegrity ability and efficiency with which it is conducted There is very much in the government service now to be proud of more than many people think But there are serious handi caps to efficiency which can be re moved and the governments hap hazard employment policy is one of them The administration of the Civil Service on the merit system free from patronage and politics has been stead ily extended until it covers a very large part of the Federal Government In this extension the Civil Service74 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY TABLE 15 MISCELLANEOUS EARNINGS FEES AND CREDITS FOR SALE OF PROPERTY CIVIL ACTIVITIES OF U S GOVERNMENT

as well as the goodwill of administra tors and the moral support of the public and has done a work of im mense importance Nevertheless it can not be denied that there are serious defects in the Civil Service The standard of the personnel in many cases is not what it should be the quantity and quality of work done is frequently unsatisfactory experienced and competent men and women leave the service in large numbers and their places are taken by others on the average less experienced and less com petent Owing to an inadequate and irrational salary scale many branches of the government service are so unre munerative and unattractive that their administrative officers have much diffi culty in keeping positions filled Under such circumstances it is impossible to maintain proper discipline or a high standard of efficiency and the conse quences of a lowered morale are plainly evident The situation is far more serious than it was two years ago when Congress appointed a special commission to study and report upon it LEGAL DIFFICULTIES The merit system presupposes an honest unbiased and competent ad ministration of the personnel appoint ments without favor promotions when earned security of tenure opportunity to make good recognition of work well done The government should be a just and reasonable employer if not indeed a model employer and the administrative officers of the govern ment should not only be authorized and required to deal justly and equi tably by the employes under their supervision but they should be em powered to do so In general this is farfrom being realized and the greatest handicap to good administration is not in the faults and frailties of adminis trative officers serious as they may be in some cases but in the laws and limitations imposed upon the adminis trators which tie their hands and76 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY make good administration exceedingly difficult and in the lack of adequate personnel in the Civil Service Commis sion which makes it impossible for it to co6perate with administrators as effectively as it should or to exercise the supervision over appointments and promotions which the law contem plate and which administrators would welcome The most serious of these legal difficulties are the following 1 The system of statutory positions with inflexible and generally inadequate salaries which often make appointments and promotions difficult or impossible 2 Unequal salaries in different branches of the service for a given kind of work and degree of responsibility 3 The legal prohibition of transfer and promotion from a position in one depart ment to a lumpfund position in another at a higher salary no matter how much such promotion is merited or how strongly it is recommended by the administrative officers concerned 4 The legal restriction requiring three years service before transfer from one department to another in Washington 5 The apportionment system which often makes it impossible to appoint the most competent eligibles and sometimes rules out all the applicants from several states 6 The entire lack until very recently of a retirement system for aged or disabled employes which made it necessary to retain thousands who under other condi tions would have been retired to the ad vantage of the service STANDARDIZED CIVIL SERVICE The need for improvement has long been recognized and the commission appointed by Congress made a thor ough study of all phases of the situa tion and a very complete report and drafted a bill embodying its recom TABLE 16 AVERAGE

recently a second bill has been introduced by Chairman Lehlbach of the Committee on Civil Service Reform of the House based upon the commissions report but with some important modifications If the proposed classification of the Civil Service is effected so that there will be a standardized system of posi tions and titles with systematic speci fications of qualifications and duties and salaries that are uniform through out the service for comparable duties and responsibilities then it would be possible to dispense with the present inflexible statutory positions and the unrestricted and unstandardized lump fund positions and replace both by the new standardized and classified system of positions which would be defined and authorized by law This would do away with the first two of the abovenamed legal limitations and remove the reason for the third and fourth which could then be repealed It is probably too much to expect that the fifth difficulty can be entirely removed although more active re cruiting of eligibles from states below their quota would furnish better mate 8 This bill known as the Jones bill was intro duced in the Senate by the Chairman of the Com mission in

AMERICAN ACADEMY rial and so satisfy the apportionment law without lowering the standards of the service as much as otherwise The tendency of the apportionment system is necessarily to lower the service in Washington because very often the best men in distant states can not afford to come to Washington at considerable expense in view of the inadequate salaries paid by the government The result often is that inferior men who need a job are certified from distant states and are appointed ahead of abler men from nearby states that have their full quota Active recruit ing by representatives of the Civil Service Commission in those more distant states would perhaps go far toward remedying the difficulty but it would involve some expense The last difficulty mentioned that is lack of a retirement system has lately been partially met although compul sory retirement on 30 to 60 per month according to length of service is not an attractive proposition in the higher grades of the service especially when it is learned that the salary deductions to be credited to the pen sion fund are proportional to the salary but the benefits are not For example the deductions for a 4800 position are four times as much as for a 1200 position but the retiring allowance is no more than for the latter position9 If through the adoption of a budget system or otherwise funds are made available so that adequate salaries can be paid and promotions can be made systematically and without undue delay and work can be planned ahead and carried out consecutively by those I So far as the higher positions are concerned therefore the retirement law offers no incentive for entering the government service but is one more reason for increasing salaries For the deductions from salary coming after so many in creases in the cost of living are in many cases like the straw that breaks the camels back who plan and begin it and not be interrupted frequently by a changing personnel the most serious handicaps to efficiency will be removed and a long step forward in good government will have been taken One of the greatest handicaps to good adminis tration is the lack of inducement for a career arising from inadequate sala ries for administrative and technical positions in nearly all branches of the government service Adequate sala ries which would be an incentive for the best to remain in the service of the government would be of great value to the service and would remove many difficulties arising from inexperienced men filling responsible positions With an excessive turnover in the personnel including administrative officers mis takes in administration are to be expected It is no more possible to operate an important department of the Federal Government satisfactorily with a large proportion of inexperienced officers and employes than it would be to operate a bank or a great mercantile establishment successfully with in experienced officers and employes The wonder is in some cases that the government departments do as well as they do Many men of ability and experience are serving the government at salaries below a living wage But the losses to the service due to resigna tions of such nien in responsible posi tions are very serious and the situation is steadily growing worse Paying low salaries to men in important adminis trative positions leads to inefficiency and waste rather than to economy FUNCTION OF CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION The function of the Civil Service Commission as an employment agency is to be of maximum service to the executive departments in filling posi tions and administering the personnelEXPENDITURES AND REVENUES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 81 In addition to safeguarding the inter ests of the public and of the employes by keeping the service free from the effects of politics and favoritism it is able to render great assistance to administrative officers by finding men and women who are qualified for the various positions to be filled taking full account of the needs of the service and of the importance in many cases of special training and experience In the case of supervisory and technical positions administrative officers and their trained assistants who know the requirements of the work and the qualifications needed and who are responsible for the results obtained are given a large measure of authority as well as of responsibility in making appointments and promotions The Civil Service Commission should how ever be closely in touch with the bureaus and departments and should be so well manned and so well ac quainted with the needs of the service that it can advise or overrule if neces sary intelligently and sympathetically The experience of the Civil Service Commission shows that administrative officers as a rule welcome its assistance and advice when they can deal directly and can understand one another Difficulties when they occur are gener ally caused by lack of understanding from lack of contact Prompt and efficient administration is important excessive formality and routine involv ing serious delay and unnecessary expense should be avoided10 PROMOTION ON MERIT One of the greatest handicaps to efficiency in the government service is the inability frequently to promote men when they deserve promotion 10 It is generally considered in the executive departments that the Lehlbach bill is to be pre ferred to the Jones bill in this respect 7 Promotions are made in recognition of increased earning power and to avoid losing employes through resignation The government is in competition with business and educational institutions both in appointing and holding its employes In most cases it pays rela tively low salaries for special qualifi cations and imposes conditions as to hours of service and limitations as to ones free time which are often a real hardship Moreover men in the sci entific and technical branches of the government service acquire informa tion and training of great value in the business and educational world and they are eagerly sought for at a much higher rate of compensation This is one of the most serious obstacles to efficiency and success in the govern ment service and must be faced squarely if the governments work is to be conducted on a high plane It is not expected ever to have sala ries so high in the government service that such a flow of able men out into commercial and educational work would be prevented Indeed it is not desir able to try to prevent it altogether But enough good salaries should be provided so that a reasonable propor tion at least of able and experienced men could be retained to serve as 11 Scientists and engineers in the service of the government work six days a week eleven months in the year or more often putting in a great deal of overtime without extra pay and are restrained from accepting retainers or extra compensation from outside sources which would be perfectly proper in private employment The absence of Sabbatical years and of the retiring pensions of the colleges are a further deterrent to men of standing from entering the government service from the colleges These facts in conjunction with the inadequate salaries of the government explain why it is generally impossible to recruit the higher positions from the colleges and why administrators are so anxious to retain able and successful men who have been trained in the government service and why it is so important to be able to select good material for the entering grades and to promote men as they develop82 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY administrators and educators to the rising personnel In many cases the work is so important or so technical that only men of special training and considerable experience are competent to undertake it In these cases the salaries should be such as to make it possible to build up and maintain an able and experienced staff The needs of the government service should be the first consideration Training men for the industries should be incidental The present inadequate salary scale in many departments leads to resigna tions in a great many cases just when the men are becoming really useful This makes the work unsatisfactory and its costs excessive It is one of the most important causes of ineffi ciency in the government service The United States Government is the greatest business organization in the country It employs in the ex ecutive departments more than half a million men and women in hundreds of different kinds and grades of work and carries on a business which is not only larger but more complex than any other in the country It ought to pay generous salaries and employ the ablest executives not only at the head of the various bureaus but all along the line Such a policy would pay not only in the better quality of work done but in the reduced cost of the work That the scale of salaries is inade quate in most cases is proved by the rapidly changing personnel and the difficulty of filling positions It is a byword among business men and in the colleges that the government serv ice offers little inducement for ambi tious men except as a stepping stone to something outside the government serv ice Nevertheless the responsible ad ministrative and technical officers who conduct the various branches of the executive departments of the govern ment represent collectively more of ability integrity and loyalty than they are commonly given credit for They realize more fully than may be sup posed the defects and inefficiency of the government service although these are often grossly exaggerated in the press and on the platform They also realize the tremendous handicaps to efficiency that are beyond their control and which they are fervently hoping may be removed No private business could succeed with such handicaps as well as the government does and very many do worse as it is If the execu tive departments could have a fair chance for a few years with a reor ganized and standardized civil service system and a budget they could show the country results which would be both creditable and gratifying Rear ranging the bureaus or reorganizing the departments can not possibly make the government efficient without the more fundamental reorganization of the personnel Distribution of Personnel Among the Departments Much has been said recently about the excessive number of employes in the government service and the need of drastic reductions The war had increased the activities of the govern ment in nearly all departments and it required some time to get back to a peace basis The number of employes has been considerably reduced during the past few months but figure 19 shows that on July 31 1920 the only departments or branches of the service included in the civil groups in this classification that had a relatively large increase over the personnel figures of 1916 were the State and Treasury departments and these are the depart ments which have had their activities so greatly increased by the war that this condition could not be avoided As already explained the

Labor Interstate Commerce Commission and miscellaneous taking them in the order given on the figure increased in the aggregate from 113052 in 1916 to 150975 a difference of 37923 which is 335 per cent Omitting the Treasury and State departments from the list the civil departments which have had the greatest permanent increase due to the war all the other civil depart ments named increased from 81376 to 84825 a difference of 3449 or 42 per cent Meantime the population of the country has increased more than five per cent That is all these civil departments and commissions aside from the two which have had large increases in order to take care of increased war activities have increased their personnel in four years at a rate less than the rate of growth of the population of the country The De partment of Commerce had an appre ciable increase almost entirely due to the decennial census of 1920 which however is temporary and many of these extra employes have already gone On the other hand the Panama Canal had a decrease of about the same number Considering the very moderate increases in the expenditures of the civil departments and the con siderable increase in the cost of sup plies and labor and in the miscellaneous expenses of doing business it should not be surprising to find so small an increase in the personnel of the civil departments outside of the two excep tions named It is however appar ently quite different from the general opinion and in justice to the depart ments concerned it seems worth men tioning The Cost of Living and the Pur chasing Power of Salaries During the last eight years there have been great changes in commodity prices and the cost of living and in the general scale of wages salaries and charges for professional service and some branches of the government service have readjusted their salaries accordingly But many could not do so and the result taking the goverrL ment as a whole is an inconsistent and irrational system that makes a high standard of efficiency and good service practically impossible Figure 20 shows the results of in vestigations by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics and the National Industrial Conference Board the latter consisting of representatives of a number of large manufacturing corporations The curves show the trend of wholesale commodity prices and retail food prices since 1913 and

be further declines in living costs but there seems little prospect of getting back to the 1913 level or anywhere near it Nobody proposes a reduction back to prewar figures of wages or salaries that have already been advanced although many that have been advanced 100 per cent or more may be reduced The very moderate advance proposed for govern ment salaries generally will still leave a wide margin between this advance and the relative increase in the cost of living so that the latter may fall con siderably further without falling below the new salary scale12 Living in Washington is still rela tively expensive Houses are scarce and rents are high and government employes with families find it difficult to live on their incomes The pur chasing power of salaries has fallen greatly since 1913 and still more since 1901 when many government salaries were substantially the same as now Figure 21 shows graphically how sala ries shrank between 1914 and 1920 Although justice and fair play would dictate a readjustment of government salaries that is not the only reason for urging it nor is it the strongest reason If the government could con tinue to underpay a large proportion of its employes and could permanently obtain good service at inadequate salaries and thereby save money and reduce taxes by so much more than would otherwise be possible that might be regarded as sufficient reason to adopt that policy and keep the wage scale permanently low But that is 12 It is estimated that the average increase in salaries provided by the Jones and Lehlbach bills is about eight or ten per cent above present salaries including the war bonus now paid Many would get no increases many would get five per cent or less and many of those who now get no bonus would get larger percentage in creases impossible except for a relatively few positions A limited number of men with independent incomes or without families may always be secured at inadequate salaries and of course many others who use the government service as a stepping stone to something better But a high average of ability and experience can not be maintained with out adequate salaries and for lack of it recently the service has to a large extent been demoralized Discipline and good service are impossible unless men and women are wellpaid and contented Efficiency is impossible without competent and experienced administrators Low salaries and an excessive turnover in the higher officers is not economy but wastefulness Giving a bonus of 240 only to em ployes with salaries not above 2500 per year and no increase of compensa tion to those above assumes either that living costs have not increased to those in the more responsible positions or that their services are less important and their resignations a less serious loss to the service or that they have independent incomes to fall back upon or that they may properly use up their savings laid by for an emergency or for old age and will willingly do so These are unwarranted assumptions and because this problem has not been met the government service in some de partments has been seriously crippled and will take years to recover It is hoped that the public will take an active interest in this question and urge that in the interest of economy and efficiency and good administra tion the proposed readjustment of salaries may soon be made Figure

Monthly Labor Review February 1920 p 89 December 1920 p 63 and material in press January 1921 cIj o Lij Mj ct 0t88 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY that while wholesale price levels of commodities on the average more than doubled between 1910 and 1919 the per capita cost of the civil activities of the government varied only slightly from year to year The relatively large increase in 1920 is principally due to the added work incident to the collection of the increased revenues to prohibition enforcement to conduct ing the decennial census and to the construction of public highways al though there was some increase due to increased compensation to employes and the further increase in the cost of commodities The cost of running any business including government aside from capi tal charges is made up of the cost of goods equipment materials etc and the cost of services wages and sala ries Since the government paid pre vailing market prices for its supplies the net cost of the civil activities which include the former was only main tained at practically prewar levels up to 1919 by a considerable curtailment of public works construction and of some of the other activities of the government sufficiently to offset the increased cost of labor and supplies and the considerable expansion due to the war in some departments Atten tion is especially called to the striking contrast of the cost of doing private business as shown by the increasing cost of commodities from 1915 to 1919 and the nearly constant per capita cost of the civil activities of the government in those years Duplication of Work in the Executive Departments Much is heard these days about duplication of work by the government departments and the waste of effort and money caused thereby It is true that there is not and probably never has been perfect co6rdination of effort among all the departments A wellorganized budget bureau includ ing in its functions the task of keeping in close touch with all the departments and bureaus and assisting them in delimiting their activities and in coSp erating with one another especially where their fields necessarily overlap would render a very useful and much needed service It is hoped that in the near future this longfelt want will be supplied and a distinct advance made in efficient government In the mean time however the bureaus and depart ments are cooperating in most cases as well as could be expected under existing circumstances It is believed that many of the examples of duplica tion cited are more apparent than real The Bureau of Efficiency has studied this question and has diligently sought for cases of serious duplication But it finds few such cases STATISTICAL WORK One of the most frequently cited examples of the kind is the collection of statistics It is sometimes sug gested that all statistics should be col lected by one agency which would do the work with better facilities and at less cost than the respective bureaus most concerned in the given subject could do it At present the Interstate Commerce Commission collects sta tistics about the railroads the Federal Trade Commission about the subjects it is investigating the Federal Reserve Board and the Treasury Department about business and fiscal matters the Bureau of Education about educational activities the Geological Survey about minerals the Bureau of Labor Statistics about employment conditions wages and the cost of living the Agricultural Department about crops and markets the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce about commerce while the Public Health Service gathers mortal ity and morbidity statistics and the Bureau of the Census enumerates theEXPENDITURES AND REVENUES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 89 population and gathers statistics about the wealth taxation and industries of the country and the revenues and expenditures of states and cities One might think that here is a case of duplication on a grand scale and that by having one central agency collect all the statistics and distribute them to the various departments and bu reaus concerned it would be better and more efficiently done A little con sideration will show that this would be exceedingly difficult Gathering sta tistics is not a mechanical process merely nor a task for statisticians working by themselves In order that the statistics be of value they must be gathered under the direction of experts of the subjects investigated as well as of experts in statistical work and frequently only the experts of the respective bureaus concerned know what information is wanted and how it is best obtained If at the proposed central agency for collecting the in formation we provide equally compe tent experts in all these various fields to direct the work and handle the informa tion as it is received we should have a new kind of duplication with two sets of experts instead of one one set to supervise the gathering of the informa tion and the other to interpret and make use of it That would appear to be a more expensive method and less satisfactory in operation than the present method For if those who utilize the information supervise its collection they not only have it more promptly but can get preliminary re sults from incomplete data and can modify the plans made if it appears desirable or perhaps stop short of what was first proposed A central board with representatives of all the agencies doing statistical work acting as a coardinating agency to secure the maximum degree of coiperation and to prevent overlap ping and conflict of effort would appear practicable and highly desirable The Bureau of Efficiency acts as such a central cordinating agency to some extent but there might be closer co6peration and probably some con solidation of such work That is a different thing from one agency taking over and managing all the statistical work of the government and setting up various staffs of experts which would duplicate those already in existence in the various departments The statistical work of the government can perhaps be done more efficiently than it is now done and kept more nearly up to date in some cases I would not express an opinion on that question But it appears doubtful if such work could all be centralized in a single agency and be better or more economically done than it is at present SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH It has sometimes been supposed that all chemical work could be concen trated in one central agency instead of having many chemical laboratories Chemistry in the government service is a means to an end and not an end in itself Chemical work must be done where the need arises in connection with food products in one place with minerals in another with gases and explosives in another with sanitation and health in another with industrial processes in another and so on One could as well concentrate firemen or watchmen or stenographers in one department as to concentrate all gov ernment chemists in one department Examples of apparent duplication in other scientific research are sometimes pointed out Some real cases have indeed been corrected and probably some still exist But it is believed by those well informed on the subject that the number of cases of improper duplication of scientific research in the government service is relatively small It will undoubtedly be further reduced90 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY by the better cooperation and cooSrdi nation of effort which a budget bureau when established will be able to provide In the meantime the scientific bureaus are actively co6perating with one another and endeavoring to do the most necessary work and refrain from unnecessary effort and duplication However duplication in some cases is commendable Where a problem is of supreme importance and great difficulty the chances of success are increased if more than one person or agency attempts it In some cases the difficulties and uncertainties are such that the result of a single effort would not be trusted and two inde pendent agencies could well attack the problem simultaneously Often when two men or two agencies appear to be working on the same subject they are found to be studying different phases of that subject or are attacking the same problem from entirely different standpoints and are really not dupli cating each others work at all ENGINEERING WORK Engineering work is sometimes re ferred to as an example of duplication because so many of the government departments and bureaus employ engi neers and do engineering work Engi neering is the application of science to useful ends and the government em ploys a great many kinds of scientists and engineers in many different kinds of work Various bureaus of the Army and the Navy the Geological Survey the Bureau of Mines the Coast Survey the Bureau of Stand ards the Reclamation Service the Interstate Commerce Commission the Bureau of Public Roads the Forest Service and other government agen cies employ engineers In the proposed classification of government employes twentyone dif ferent kinds of engineers are recognized To consolidate all engineering work in one or a few agencies would involve a very radical redistribution of functions and would lead to confusion and often new cases of duplication as pointed out in other kinds of work There is of course good reason for grouping to gether bureaus that are predominantly of a scientific or engineering character provided we do not sacrifice some more important consideration in doing so A Department of Commerce and Industry would be presumed to contain so far as possible all the bureaus con cerned with commerce and industry including some doing engineering work Similarly a department of Public Wel fare or of Science and Education might be formed to group together certain related activities which would neces sarily include more or less of engineer ing A Department of Public Works would presumably perform a large amount of engineering But to have one department perform all the engi neering work of the government would associate very heterogeneous functions and activities together and as it would sacrifice major considerations to minor ones would seem to be utterly imprac ticable MAP MAKING Map making is another example of alleged duplication The Coast and Geodetic Survey makes the surveys of the shore line and all coastal waters of the United States and its possessions for nautical charts and establishes the primary horizontal and vertical control points or stations of the country from their own surveys The Geological Survey makes topographical surveys and prepares and publishes the stand ard topographic maps based on the fundamental control surveys of the Coast and Geodetic Survey The Engineer Corps of the War Depart ment makes military maps principallyEXPENDITURES AND REVENUES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 91 in the Philippines Hawaii and Panama The Hydrographic Office prepares maps for the use of the Navy but its work is confined to areas entirely out side the continental limits of the United States The General Land Office makes surveys and maps of the public lands for facilitating placing settlers on unoccupied areas the Reclamation Service maps its own reclamation projects when necessary The Bureau of Soils makes soil surveys and plots the same on special maps and no one could do this better than the soil experts who make the surveys Each service is engaged in a different kind of highly technical work and handles its own data and constructs its own maps although using the data of other agencies so far as possible If each made the same kind of maps it would involve wasteful duplication but all the maps could not be made by the same group of artisans and map ex perts and it is not believed by these mapmaking agencies that it would be better to have it done by one agency The Board of Surveys and Maps of the Federal Government represents all the federal agencies concerned and the question of securing greater efficiency is being given careful consideration In the meantime the board is securing cooperation among all the mapmaking agencies of the government and also codperating with private mapmaking agencies and is striving to avoid un necessary duplication It is very probable that there would be loss and not gain to attempt to consolidate all of the technical map work of the govern ment in one place PUBLIC HEALTH Public health is another subject in which wasteful duplication has been charged The Public Health Service is the one great agency of the govern ment which is primarily concerned with this subject and it is sometimes sug gested that all activities relating to public health should be performed by that organization and that the present method of distributing some of these activities and having a number of departments and bureaus cooperate in public health work is wasteful The problem is however not so simple as it might appear at first glance The State Department collects much valu able information all over the world on subjects related to public health in cluding results of investigations relating to epidemics and vital statistics and transmits them to the Public Health Service This is useful cooperative work and of great value to the Public Health Service For the latter to send its agents abroad to collect this infor mation independently of the State Department would be enormously more expensive and more difficult than the present method The Interstate Commerce Commis sion performs some public health functions in connection with its super vision of interstate commerce and travel It is done effectively and in perfect accord with the Public Health Service and is another example of commendable co6peration To re quire the Public Health Service to do it because it is logical to have all public health functions performed by one agency would probably involve in creased cost and complication of administration that would be a heavy price to pay for the gain resulting from a consolidation of functions The Post Office performs some public health functions in connection with the mails but it is done in co6peration with the Public Health Service To require the latter to go into the Post Office Department and do what the Post Office is now doing for itself would probably lead to greater rather than less expense and confusion The Bu99 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY reau of Mines is charged with some public health functions in connection with mines but the work is performed for it by the Public Health Service The Department of Agriculture is doing a large amount of public health work in connection with food products That department believes that it is just as logical to have all investigations and regulations concerning agricultural and food products in one department as it is to have all public health work done by one agency The important and extensive meat inspection work of the government is carried on by the Bureau of Animal Industry a bureau devoted to the investigation of a wide range of problems in animal industry including the diseases of animals The inspection of animal carcasses slaugh tered for human food and of meat packing plants and processes seems a very natural extension of its work This is of course a public health function and might be transferred to the Public Health Service But if so it would replace one kind of duplica tion by another and it is a question which is to be preferred The animal quarantine laws are also administered by the Department of Agriculture Again the Bureau of Chemistry enforces the pure food laws which is in part a public health function If this were transferred to the Public Health Service there would probably be two chemical laboratories instead of one studying food products one in the Department of Agriculture studying the questions of production and distri bution not primarily concerning the public health and the other in the Public Health Service studying foods in connection with the enforcement of the pure food laws Whether that would be better than the present arrangement is the question At pres ent the two agencies are codperating and assisting one another The divi sion of the Bureau of Chemistry which enforces the laws concerning the sale of drugs is in charge of a surgeon de tailed from the Public Health Service who has the resources of the Public Health Service and the Bureau of Chemistry at his command One aspect of the matter that should not be overlooked is that the enforcement of the pure food laws is largely an educational matter the aim being to instruct and assist the industries so as to obviate so far as possible the neces sity for prosecution It is desirable therefore that the enforcing agency be thoroughly in touch with methods of production and know what is possible and practicable The Bureau of Fisheries supervises among other things the catching and packing of salmon in Alaska and the Columbia River to prevent their extermination and to make sure that the meat is fresh when packed The latter is of course a public health function but it is much more con venient and economical to have both functions performed by one set of inspectors than to have two sets one representing the Bureau of Fisheries and dealing with the culture and pro tection of fish and the other with the precautions to protect the public health The latter method would involve a much more serious kind of duplication than the former and it is a question whether it would not be less businesslike and less effective The Bureau of Immigration per forms some public health functions but there is close co6peration with the Public Health Service which makes the principal medical examinations of immigrants as provided by law and there is no duplication of effort between the two services The Army is con cerned with public health and again there is close co6peration with the Public Health Service A centralEXPENDITURES AND REVENUES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 93 co6rdinating board like the Federal Board of Maps and Surveys might be very successful in securing more effect ive co6peration of all federal agencies in this important work FEDERAL AND STATE COOPERATION More difficult than the relations of the departments of the Federal Govern ment to one another in public health work is the relation of the Federal Government to the states and cities Here again one can not carve out a block of activities and say that therein the Federal Government is supreme and outside it the states and cities may function without restraint Overlap ping of fields is inevitable and hence there must be co6peration and a good understanding and the proper spirit of accommodation and above all a desire to serve the public as effectively as possible The bad consequences of a lack of co6peration and understand ing are quite as serious as duplication of effort and in some cases far more so The whole problem calls for the most careful study and intelligent handling No mere reorganization would solve the difficulties unless provision is made for co6peration of the various agencies concerned federal state municipal and private and this applies not only to public health work but more or less to all the scientific and technical work of the government and much of the inspectional work If a more complete information service could be maintained among the departments so that the information or technical facilities existing in one place could be made known and be available wherever and whenever they may be needed and thus mistakes or useless effort or duplication of facilities be avoided it would be of great value to the service and tend to increase efficiency Much of the value of scientific and engineering societies lies in the contact they provide between those engaged in similar lines of work and the opportunity afforded to get this kind of information In the gov ernment service this need is partially met in such unofficial ways and also partially through official channels but there is undoubtedly room for improvement BARRIERS TO CO6PERATION One of the most frequent reasons for incomplete cooperation is the lack of funds to enable a given bureau or agency to do the work in its line that another agency of the government needs In such cases the bureau needing the service will often from necessity do the work for itself and may thus get a line of work established which is continued This is the way in which some of the mapmaking work originated If the Coast and Geodetic Survey and the Geological Survey had been provided with suf ficient funds to do all the work the occasion for starting the work in some of the other branches of the service would not have arisen Until very recently the transfer of funds from one department to another to cover the cost of work done by one agency of the government for another was not permitted That is a bureau having funds and needing an investigation or survey or other service could not repay some other bureau that was especially qualified to perform that service for the cost of the work Hence if the other bureau did not have surplus funds and so could not bear the expense without reimbursement a condition that often occurs the bureau need ing the service would be obliged to do the work itself or employ someone outside the government to do it This legal barrier to co6peration tended to promote duplication Since the war when the necessity and advan94 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY tages of co6peration among the de partments was so fully demonstrated Congress has authorized the transfer of funds from one branch of the govern ment to another for services rendered or to be rendered The next step will be when a budget bureau is estab lished not only to permit such transfer of funds but to encourage or even in many cases to require it in order that work may be done to best advantage and duplication of work and facilities be reduced to a minimum It should not be understood from the above that there are no examples of undesirable duplication in the govern ment or that great improvements can not be made On the contrary many improvements can and should be made But many of the cases of duplication and waste frequently cited are appar ent rather than real and others have arisen from circumstances beyond the control of the bureaus concerned It is important in proposing remedies not to suggest a worse condition than the one to be corrected The problem is exceedingly difficult and can not be solved by the same procedure in every case The government service is so extensive and complex that there is great need of a competent and effective co6rdinating agency which would be able to promote codperation and a good understanding and largely eliminate unnecessary duplication of effort and such an agency it is presumed the budget bureau will become The Value of Research and Stand ardization in Government We have discussed above two major reforms or advances in the Federal Government which it is generally hoped may be realized at an early date namely 1 the classification and standardization of the personnel of the government with the accompanying adjustment in compensation when necessary so as to make it possible to maintain a high order of public serv ants and have a competent and efficient public service 2 the establishment of an executive budget handled by a well equipped budget bureau so that the work of the government may be syste matically planned and co6rdinated and its various departments and bu reaus may cooperate to best advantage on the one hand avoiding duplication of effort and equipment and on the other seeing that important work is not neglected through lack of provision for it A third improvement now under study and discussion is the rearrangement of some of the activities of the government so as to form more logical or more convenient groupings and perhaps enlarge or add some activ ities now inadequately provided for These improvements if fully real ized should constitute the greatest advance in the effectiveness and effi ciency of the government that has been made in many years There is a fourth advance that can be made compara ble I believe in its beneficial results with the others mentioned namely the application in far greater measure than heretofore of the methods and results of science to the conduct of government Science has had an hon ored place in the scheme of the Federal Government and has rendered inval uable service in many directions There would be nothing new in what is proposed except that the utilization of the methods and results of science would be more general and scientific research would be carried out on a much more adequate scale than here tofore Scientific men should not be looked down upon as theorists nor looked up to as philosophers but re garded as equally necessary with business men and lawyers and others in the solution of the manifold prob lems of governmentEXPENDITURES AND REVENUES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 95 In doing things as well as possible whether in business or in government it is necessary to have full information To know and to do as well as we know is what is needed To solve the prob lems of government successfully will be difficult enough if the fullest in formation obtainable by means of scientific research is available All experience shows that such work if wisely planned and competently conducted is profitable it would pay for itself many times As it would be an investment that would return dividends almost at once its cost is not a serious objection Large and suc cessful business organizations have found such use of science to be profit able and the business of the govern ment is no less important and would probably be benefited by such work no less than that of private concerns During the World War the govern ments of the various nations utilized science extensively in devising methods of destruction as well as of protection Should we not be as diligent in utilizing the creative and beneficent results of scientific work in times of peace as we were in utilizing it for destruction and protection in time of war In the application of the methods and results of science to the problems of government one of the first things to come to mind is the problem of public health The war showed an unsatisfactory condition as to health of a surprisingly large percentage of those examined in the draft The greatest waste in all ages of the world has been the waste of human life and what the government does for its people in this respect is one of the best measures of the quality of govern ment as well as of civilization itself To contend that the state is concerned only in minor degree for the lives or health of its citizens assumes not only callous unconcern to human suffering but stupid indifference to economic loss Such economic loss arises from the necessity of caring for the indigent and from the loss of production of those wholly or partially incapacitated and the loss of those whose death is preventable A far larger sum for medical research and sanitary pre cautions would be justified from eco nomic considerations alone it would be justified again by the desirability of rendering the maximum of service practicable to the taxpaying public it would be justified still again by considerations of humanity and service to mankind For the benefits of research in medicine are as wide as the world and this country can well afford under present circumstances to give to those beyond our borders some benefit of this kind for all we have received in times past from without In the many social and economic problems which arise in connection with government there is great opportunity to apply the methods and results of science and much is now done in this direction Without going into the question of what more should be done in this important field I wish to point out a line of work which vitally affects the conduct of the governments busi ness as well as the interests of business outside the government in which it would appear that very much more could be done to advantage than is now done One of the commonest and most necessary acts of government is pur chasing materials and supplies paper ink office equipment coal lumber machinery electric lamps instruments chemicals textiles leather goods and hundreds of varieties of manufactured product Such government purchases must be made in the open market with no favoritism to particular bidders and the lowest or at least the best bid accepted No officer of the govern96 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY ment can award contracts intelligently and fairly and accept or reject deliv eries justly without proper specifica tions and full information as to qual ities To prepare specifications that are adequate and fair is a difficult matter and often involves extended research If the government does this work intelligently and does its buying wisely and tests deliveries systematic ally it not only gets what it bargains for and saves far more than the cost of the testing but it maintains its dignity and integrity encourages good quality and good workmanship raises the standards of business and benefits the general public On the contrary if it buys with inadequate specifica tions and accepts goods without test it lays its representatives open to charges of favoritism or collusion encourages misrepresentation discour ages clean competition rewards the dishonest and defrauds the taxpayer who ultimately pays the bills As between these two methods of doing business it would seem that there was no room for hesitation and yet the officers of the government are often forced to use the second method in stead of the first from the lack of proper specifications and tests because funds are not available to permit the proper agency to do the work EXAMPLES OF GOVERNMENT TESTING For many years electric lamps pur chased by the government have been systematically inspected at the factory and samples selected for test in the laboratory The information so ob tained is utilized in the preparation and periodical revision of standard specifications which are used in the purchase and testing of lamps Elec tric lamps are made by highly special ized technical processes It is very easy to make lamps that will give light but difficult to make lamps of high quality Since government purchases of lamps have been consolidated into large contracts and lamps have been systematically tested according to proper specifications the prices have been the lowest and the quality of the lamps the highest that the market affords The ordering of lamps by each department is now a simple routine operation whereas formerly the separate purchasing of lamps in volved dealing with agents of various manufacturers and guessing as to who offered the best values The syste matic testing of lamps by the govern ment not only protects the govern ment in its purchases but it protects the public in large measure for the testing is a constant check and stim ulus to the manufacturer and tends to keep up the quality of the entire product and so benefits the public The value of this work which puts the purchase of lamps by the government on a business basis and protects the manufacturer of a highgrade product as well as the user is many times the cost of the work The influence of the government instead of being hurtful as it formerly was is thus stimulating and helpful to the industry tending to raise the quality of the product and to improve business methods The testing of paper for the govern ment is another example of construct ive work which puts the governments purchases on a business basis and tends to help the industry instead of degrade it Formerly the government bought paper in great quantities on incom plete specifications and accepted deliv eries upon inadequate tests Manu facturers knew that they could supply something different from what was specified and one who was willing to do so had the advantage over one who supplied what was called for This resulted in many manufacturers refusEXPENDITURES AND REVENUES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 97 ing to bid on government contracts and created an intolerable situation which was corrected when the speci fications were made adequate and tests were complete and systematic Such work if properly done with the full cooperation of the manufacturers leads to most valuable standardization work which may in time cover the entire products of an industry The government is a large user of textiles The textile industry is one of the largest and most important of our industries and one which concerns every man woman and child in the country If textiles were standardized so that they could be bought and sold on adequate and intelligent specifica tions and consumers as well as whole sale and retail dealers could know what they are buying and could get what they pay for it would be of enormous benefit to all Suppose the brand or name of every textile product was defined in such a way as to convey precise information and the same name always meant the same quality And suppose that dyes were tested and certified and one could depend on the mark as to their permanence and were told what conditions they would stand or would not stand Would it not be worth many millions of dollars every year to the public to have such in formation And would it not be a boon to honest dealers both wholesale and retail The only class to be injured by such a situation would be those who thrive by misrepresentation or by selling inferior goods on their appearance without representation The thor ough investigation of textiles and the preparation of adequate specifications for government purchases would be of great value not only to the govern ment but to the entire public It seems certain that this work would be as useful as the grading of lumber or cattle or wheat Cement is a product that is used by the government in large quantities and is a material in which good quality can only be assured in advance by special test The work of the govern ment has been thorough and creditable in this connection and through co6p eration with the industry specifications have been developed which are every where recognized as standard All the cement for the Panama Canal was systematically tested and the integrity of the work thereby assured Many other products employed in the build ing industries should be studied thor oughly and standard specifications prepared and if this is done with the cordial cooperation of the industries which is assured in advance if the government would take the lead ade quately the benefits to the entire public would be enormous This work could also be extended to include methods of applying materials and to a study of heat retarding and fire resist ing properties of building materials Such work is in fact being done by the government on a small scale but it ought to be carried out on a scale commensurate with the importance of the industry CONTRACTS FOR SUPPLIES The General Supply Committee made up of representatives from the ten executive departments and acting under the direction of the Secretary of the Treasury makes contracts for a great variety of supplies used by the government and issues an annual catalog so that all departments may order from the common list This is an important step in advance over the former method of independent pur chase by every agency of the govern ment but it is far short of what is needed At present contracts are for 898 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY an indefinite aggregate quantity to be delivered when called for by any de partment in any quantity however small The contract extends over one fiscal year beginning some months after the time of bidding and the contractor must gamble on the future cost of his goods There is too great an element of chance both as to quantity needed by the government and the market price during the term of the contract to make it a satisfactory method of doing business The gov ernment should buy in wholesale lots for early delivery and do its own dis tributing and thus remove the uncer tainties as to quantity and market price and make it a normal business transaction Moreover when deliv eries are made in small lots at irregular intervals it not only greatly increases the cost of delivery but makes it impossible systematically to test the quality of the goods delivered If deliveries were made in carload lots samples could be taken and tested to see that they were in accordance with the specifications or terms of purchase and thus no opportunity would be offered to substitute something dif ferent13 The present method often leads to very awkward and embarrassing sit uations If the market price falls the departments are obliged to pay more for the goods than they are worth and the contractor makes an excessive profit if it advances the government often compels the contractor to deliver the goods at a loss and he sometimes fails to deliver and pleads inability to 13As an example several departments of the government recently received and paid for a large quantity of soap powder which was after ward discovered to contain 87 per cent of soap instead of 30 per cent called for in the contract The contractor admits that it is not according to specifications and is willing to refund a part of the purchase price but it has not yet been determined what allowance should be made get the goods14 It is exceedingly unfortunate for the government to put its department officers into such a position and to compel them to do business under such a handicap If on the other hand purchases can be made in wholesale quantity as needed and tested as delivered and the lowest market prices always paid for the quality needed the governments busi ness is freed from the element of speculation and uncertainty and it may be conducted in a strictly business like way This will involve some extra expense for conducting the sup ply department but it would save a great deal in the cost of goods and also in clerical and auditing work in all the departments The problem of specifications and tests for materials and supplies is of very great importance also to states and municipalities To put purchas ing on a sound business basis free from even the suspicion of politics and favoritism is practically impossible without adequate specifications and tests of materials If the Federal Government should co6perate with the states and municipalities on a com prehensive program of work of this kind it would yield results of enormous value to state and municipal govern ment This kind of co6perative work also has great educational value to those who participate in it including representatives both of the govern ment and of business The purchasing of supplies and the letting of contracts give rise to some of the most difficult problems in government If there is made available in this work the results of scientific and engineering research 4 Recently a contractor for a material used in photographic work reported that the market price had fallen since he closed his contract with the government and that he could make a satis factory profit at 800 per pound instead of 1200 per pound which his contract called for This is however not a frequent occurrenceEXPENDITURES AND REVENUES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 99 and cobperative effort in the prepara tion of specifications and the making of tests such work can be done in a way to elevate and benefit both business and government The accuracy and honesty of the weights and measures of trade are assured by government inspection and test Commodities are measured when sold and resold at wholesale and retail by weights and measures which should comply when new with proper specifications and be maintained up to a certain standard during their useful life States and municipalities assume the responsibility for the inspection of ordinary weights and measures but the Federal Government does the work in most states for track scales that require special and expensive equip ment to test and also cooperates with the states in their inspection work This work is adequately done in some cases but it is far from satisfactory in most states and cities Considering the importance of the matter to all the people and the strong temptation to use inaccurate or fraudulent weights and measures where there is no inspection it would appear that the government should support this work better than it does The war called for scientific research in connection with the standardization and making of munitions finding and using substitute materials locating enemy guns by sound and flash ranging building and equipping airplanes diri gibles and balloons and many other major subjects as well as countless minor ones This called for well equipped scientific laboratories and the trained personnel of research workers and assistants The govern ment laboratories of the principal allied countries were utilized to the limit of their capacity and all kinds of makeshift facilities were pressed into service When we came into the war the same was true in this country If preparations had been begun sev eral years before results would have been obtained sooner and the war appreciably shortened In view of this experience and the probability that science and technology will be no less important in the future than in the past the question naturally arises whether this government is giving adequate support to scientific research as a part of its program of military preparedness In time of war the civil branches of the govern ment will be called upon immediately and they will be able to render inval uable service if they are adequately equipped and manned In the mean time pending the arrival of the war which we hope will never come they will be able to render useful service in civil problems and so be more than selfsupporting This kind of prepara tion for war which adds nothing to the military budget if the civil depart ments are adequately supported should appeal to all as practicable and desirable The above are only a few instances which could be multiplied almost indefinitely where scientific research and specifications based thereon and tests made systematically by an un biased and competent agency would be of immense value to the federal state and municipal governments of the country Specifications would be made in co6peration with the industry and would be accompanied in many cases with standardization that would be of great value to the general public Their value in raising the standards of business in governments federal state and municipal can hardly be over estimated There is another class of standards of great value to the states and munici palities as well as to industry in the preparation of which the Federal Gov100 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY ernment is codperating I refer to safety and building codes and other standards of practice Cooiperation of the Federal Govern ment in the Preparation of Safety and Building Codes and Pub lic Utility Standards One of the most valuable opportu nities for cobperative work by the gov ernment is in safety research and edu cation that is to say in studying methods of reducing accidents in the industries and in everyday life in formulating sets of safety rules or codes and in assisting the accident and industrial commissions of the states in adopting and administering them and manufacturers in complying with them More than 3000000 in dustrial accidents occur every year of which 25000 are fatal Many mil lions of dollars are expended annually by employers for accident compen sation and the cost of insurance and many millions more are lost by injured employes in wages not com pensated Several millions of dollars per year are also spent in accident prevention work Nearly every state has an accident commission which su pervises the collection of compensation for accidents but many of them do very little to reduce accidents A few states have provided their commis sions with generous sums to enable them to prepare safety rules and put them into effect and valuable results have been secured by such efforts Recently a comprehensive program of safety work has been initiated in which many agencies are cooperating This work includes the preparation of a large number of different safety codes covering the hazards of manu facturing in many different industries including transportation mining and the use of electricity gas machinery and explosives by the industries and the public These safety codes are more than mere sets of safety rules often amounting to a standardization of engineering practice in many as pects of an industry and being of great value in promoting efficiency and good practice as well as safety They are being prepared by the active cobpera tion of all the interests concerned in cluding engineering societies industrial and insurance associations state acci dent boards manufacturers of ma chinery and appliances and the Fed eral Government The work is under the general auspices of the American Engineering Standards Committee which gives its approval to the codes The work of preparing the codes in volves study and discussion a com parison of experience and a considera tion of the best operating methods Efficiency and good service are con sidered as prominently as safety Some of the more important exam ples of these codes are the steam boiler code of the American Society of Me chanical Engineers the electrical fire code of the National Fire Protection Association and the national electrical safety code of the Bureau of Stand ards A national elevator code codes for steel mills blast furnaces foun dries machine shops textile mills saw mills and many other industrial estab lishments are being prepared or are under consideration The government is rendering a val uable service in this work but the work suffers for lack of funds The industries the engineering societies and the state commissions are doing their share of the work The Federal Governments share is important and should be well done and yet at a time when it should be strengthened it has been seriously crippled The cost of the work is trifling in comparison with its value and it does not seem possible that this work will be allowed to lag orEXPENDITURES AND REVENUES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 101 cease for want of funds if the general public could but understand its im mense importance and usefulness Aside from questions of humanity and the economic value of human life the losses in wages and the damages paid in compensation amount to so many millions annually that the small amounts required for the govern ments share of the work are insignifi cant in comparison Probably no work of the Federal Government is more useful or more productive in pro portion to its cost and none is more needed by the country at large The states and the industries are waiting to put these safety codes into effect and the great advantage of national uni formity will result if they are prepared so well that they can come into general use The work should be strengthened and enlarged at an early day as a measure of efficiency and economy as well as of humanity and good gov ernment How THE GOVERNMENT ASSISTS There are four ways in which the government assists in this work of pre paring and putting into effect indus trial safety codes besides the part it takes in the initiation of the program of safety code work and the general su pervision and approval of the work through its membership in the Ameri can Engineering Standards Committee 1 In the capacity of sponsor to prepare some of the safety codes with the assistance of committees repre senting the industries and other in terests immediately concerned The national electrical safety code the national gas safety code a national aviation code a code for the protection of the heads and eyes of workmen the use of electricity in mines a general mining safety code and other codes have been prepared or are being planned by government departments either alone or in conjunction with other sponsors 2 Representatives of the govern ment serve on committees for codes of which engineering or insurance organ izations or safety societies are sponsors and are able to render very valuable assistance if they can attend meetings and do the work involved in such serv ice It is exceedingly important that the codes be consistent with one an other and as uniform in plan and ar rangement as practicable in order that they may be as acceptable and useful as possible and come to be used in every state so far as its industries require them The departments of the Federal Government concerned can serve as valuable cobrdinating agents in this work if they are provided with the means to work with and thus make the work more valuable and more gen erally utilized 3 The Federal Government can be of very great assistance to state acci dent commissions in adopting safety rules and codes if it can send its repre sentatives on request to attend hear ings where the codes are being consid ered This is cobperative work of the finest kind and of the greatest value The government in no way infringes upon the states prerogatives but on the contrary recognizes the authority and responsibility of the states and responds with assistance only when it is asked It is efficient and economical for a few experts in these safety codes many of which are highly technical and of an engineering character can ex plain and interpret them to the acci dent boards in all the states 4 The government can perform a useful function in assisting manufac turers and the industries generally in their studies of the codes and in their task of getting them into use This is largely an educational problem To educate the millions of workmen in102 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY volved throughout all the states and all the industries is a problem of great magnitude and the Federal Govern ment can not afford to fail to do the little it is asked to do when the states and the industries are doing so much One of the most interesting of the codes in this program is the Aviation Safety Code covering air planes air ships and balloons so far as safety is concerned their design and construc tion their instrumental equipment their operation inspection and testing the qualifications of aviators signaling systems landing fields and various other safety requirements and pre cautions The preparation of such a safety code is an engineering and edu cational work The code would be useful to any governmental or munici pal authority which has occasion to adopt it or parts of it it would be use ful also to aviators and the public even though it were not enforced by any governmental authority It is impor tant that before local authorities have adopted various conflicting rules and requirements there should be a thor ough study made which can be the basis of reasonably uniform rules and requirements and in view of the many hazards involved it is none too soon to begin such a study BUILDING CODES Another class of standards of prac tice akin to safety codes are the build ing codes of cities They contain many requirements regarding the con struction of buildings the question of fireproof or fireresistive materials fire escapes and exits lighting ventilation heating plumbing and in the larger cities a very large number of other re quirements They need to be revised from time to time as building methods change as new materials or new infor mation are made available or the growth of the city makes new provi sions desirable But the revision of such a code is a tremendously difficult undertaking un less information on the properties of materials and appliances is available from a competent and unbiased source The Federal Government is in position to render a service of immense value to the cities of this country if with the co6peration of manufacturers engi neering societies and associations of municipal officers it will carry out a thorough study of all the questions in volved in a city building code The work should be carried on continu ously and indefinitely for new ques tions and new materials will require investigation and the work would probably never cease But useful re sults would begin to flow from such an investigation almost immediately and would continue so long as the investi gation lasted Some very valuable work of this kind has already been done by the Federal Government but it has never been adequately supported The work should be carried out on a scale commensurate with the importance of the problem It would tend to stand ardize many building operations and would in many cases improve con struction and in others reduce costs It is another case where fuller infor mation is needed and where research made by a competent and unbiased agency and made available throughout the country is the most economical as well as the best method and tends to standardize and unify practice to the great benefit of the industry and the public This is an opportune time to take up such an investigation for there is great need of reducing the cost of building of eliminating needless labor and materials of standardizing prod ucts and making information as available as possible to architects toEXPENDITURES AND REVENUES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 108 builders to manufacturers and to the public generally PUBLIC UTILITIES The government should co5perate actively with the electric light and power gas electric railway and tele phone companies in the study of the many engineering questions involved in rendering good service to the public The changed economic conditions of recent years have made it necessary for most public utility companies to ask for advances in rates sometimes repeatedly And as prices decline it is necessary for rates to be readjusted These frequent rate changes are diffi cult and perplexing not only to the companies and the commissions hav ing jurisdiction but to the public as well As the public in the end must pay all the cost the public is vitally concerned in having efficient and eco nomical management of these utilities The government could render a serv ice of immense usefulness and impor tance by studying the problems of the public utilities and helping the com panies to secure more efficient opera tion and a better understanding by the public of their difficulties and their needs The utilities represent a spe cial kind of partnership between their owners and the public in which the owners agree to furnish the plant and the service and the public grants a monopoly privilege and agrees to ac cept the service rendered and to pay the entire cost plus a profit to the utility company If the companys credit is impaired or it fails altogether the community as well as the com pany suffers It is evident therefore that public officials and citizens asso ciations should take a keen and intel ligent interest in public utility prob lems and while being fair to the utility company should look carefully after the communitys interest The government has been rendering important service in studying various public utility problems and working out standards of service Enough has been done to demonstrate the value of such work and to show that cobipera tion is practicable But it could render a service of vastly greater importance to the utilities and to the public by an expenditure of a generous sum each year for research and education on utility problems It would cost less than one cent per year per capita of the countrys population whereas the value of the service that would be rendered to the public would possibly be fifty times the cost The utilities collect several billions of dollars every year from the citizens of this country for service To expend a few cents out of each hundred dollars paid for such service to improve the service and in crease efficiency would be conservative and it could not fail to be profitable The subject of this investigation con cerns not only the quality and cost of public utility service but often also the quality of municipal government It is one of the most vital and far reach ing questions confronting American municipalities and deserves to be con sidered very carefully There is no conflict of authority in this work for the legal jurisdiction of the states and cities is not questioned The Federal Government cotiperates with the latter on request and places the results of its investigations at their disposal The problems are much the same in all the states and cities and it is economical to have the investiga tions available to all It is the same kind of voluntary cotiperation that ob tains in the investigations of the prob lems of agriculture mining manufac turing and education Cotiperation of business concerns in the study of the problems of commerce and industry has greatly increased in recent years104 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY Cooperation among federal state and municipal governments in studying problems of government is equally advantageous RAILWAY RESEARCH The railroads of the country are our greatest public utility probably equal in magnitude of investment and annual cost to the public of all the other public utilities combined The government through the Interstate Commerce Commission has long exercised super vision over the rates charged for freight and passenger traffic in order to prevent discrimination or overcharge and has also supervised equipment and to some extent operation with respect to safety It is now completing a val uation of all railroad property and has been given additional responsibilities since the return of the railroads to private management and control Owing to the very great increase in wages paid and in the cost of fuel and supplies the railroads are finding it more difficult than ever to pay ex penses and earn a reasonable dividend for their stockholders Rates have been raised repeatedly and still the revenues are insufficient It is there fore more necessary than ever that they should cooiperate with and help one another and that they should in crease their efficiency of operation to the very maximum Here is an oppor tunity for the government to increase its coiSperation with the railroads in constructive scientific and engineering work in order to improve performance to eliminate waste to reduce costs and to better the service Probably no one would claim that there is no opportunity for improve ment in these respects although it may be that the possibilities are not as great as one would think If however it can be shown that the railroads have attained a high degree of efficiency in all these respects and are as economic ally and efficiently managed as possi ble or as could be expected the em ployes of the railways will undoubtedly look with much greater favor upon the proposal to reduce wages In the in terest of fair play and the rights of the public which is called upon to furnish all the revenues from which labor and capital are compensated it is highly desirable that the railroads be operated efficiently and economically and that the public be assured that such is the case as should be done with all public utilities We think of private owner ship of the railroads sometimes as though they were private property as to management but a public utility as to service and rates The railroads like other public utilities should be managed and maintained as public utilities and wasteful competition in efficient operation and needless expense should so far as possible be discovered and eliminated Certainly it would appear desirable under present circum stances for the government to do every thing possible to cooiperate with the railroads in their efforts to increase their efficiency and make themselves self supporting The Value of Research and Standard ization to the Industries The problem of increasing produc tion and reducing costs in the indus tries without increasing the length of the working day or reducing wages so far as to make impossible an American standard of living is a fundamental one We can not invoke magic we can not get something for nothing we can not depend so much as formerly upon the bounty of nature Only by greater knowledge and increased effi ciency and the more complete elimina tion of waste can we hope to compete with other countries where labor is cheaper and the standard of livingEXPENDITURES AND REVENUES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 105 lower Industrial research and stand ardization will play a large part in the solution of this tremendously impor tant and difficult problem provided it is carried on intelligently and adequately and with the coperation of all the in terests concerned To secure this gen eral cobperation and the best results it is imperative that the government should take an active part We have discussed above the value of research and standardization in government ad ministration It remains to consider it from the standpoint of efficiency in commerce and industry There are serious objections to gov ernment ownership or government con trol of business although a certain measure of regulation or control is necesssary in many kinds of business But it is hard to think of a valid reason why the government should not coop erate with industry for the purpose of increasing the productivity of labor of reducing the waste of effort and mate rials of discovering new and better methods of increasing prosperity and advancing our civilization Co6pera tion of many agencies with the aid of the government has been shown to be practicable and profitable in numerous instances It is welcomed by the indus tries it is beneficial to the public it strengthens the nation The time is ripe for such work and the industries are calling for help It only remains to provide those branches of the gov ernment that are in position to do work of this kind the means to work with and the work will proceed It is sometimes objected that gov ernments are to govern and not to assist industry let business take care of itself But the people suffer if busi ness is inefficient those who are em ployed in the industries as well as those who use the products of industry Hence the concern of the government is not merely for the welfare of the owners of the business but for the wel fare of all the people and the country as a whole In some cases business con cerns have consolidated in great cor porations and come to a position where they carry on research exten sively and efficiently without the help of the government and even gain con trol of an industry Many instructive and convincing examples of the value of industrial re search are afforded by the modern his tory of industry and it is highly de sirable that the benefits of research may be realized by the industries gen erally The National Research Coun cil is actively engaged in promoting scientific and industrial research and the American Engineering Standards Committee is promoting engineering and industrial standardization Both organizations are receiving the coop eration of the government but not the adequate and effective cotperation they need and hope for because the government agencies concerned are not given sufficient means to work with It is believed that a better apprecia tion by the public of the importance of such work would result in better sup port of this work and great benefit to the industries and the public THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF STANDARD IZATION The American Engineering Stand ards Committee is a codiperative or ganization devoted to the problems of national and international standardiza tion Twelve engineering societies or groups of societies and five depart ments of the Federal Government are represented in its membership The Committee is already actively at work in selecting sponsor societies for stand ardization work and approving stand ards The government is rendering a valuable service to the industries and thus to the people by cotiperating in106 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY this constructive and useful work Manufacturers have not co6perated with one another in the past in stand ardizing designs as much as they could have done if there had been more adequate means of cotiperating They have resented government dicta tion and control but they welcome government cooperation in construct ive work that benefits both them and the public In many cases the designs and sizes of machines and materials manufactured by different concerns are different merely because develop ment has been independent In other cases needless differences are intro duced in order to have something dif ferent In either case too many sizes and designs and lack of interchange ability increase the cost to the manu facturer to the distributor and to the user Nothing promotes economy and efficiency in the use of raw materials and finished products more than intel ligent standardization It reduces the varieties and sizes of materials that must be supplied by the manufacturer lessens the stocks that must be carried by the distributor makes the cost of the finished product less and reduces the trouble and expense to the user in caring for and keeping in repair ma chinery and equipment of all kinds The manufacture of scientific instru ments has recently come to be an im portant industry in this country This is partly owing to the greater use than formerly of scientific instruments in the industries and partly to the war which has largely reduced the importation of scientific apparatus from abroad The government would do well to cotiperate actively with the manufacturers and with scientific and engineering societies in standardizing and describing scientific apparatus so that the manufacturer will know better the properties and capabilities of his own output of apparatus and the pur chaser will know how to select appara tus and whether he gets what he orders In other words scientific apparatus should be scientifically described and intelligently used and the govern ment could render an invaluable serv ice in aiding to bring this about The metallurgical industries have been greatly developed in recent years through scientific research and there is now greater activity than ever in this field The manufacture of glass por celain tile and other clay products has been greatly stimulated during the war by the cobperation of scientific laboratories and vast benefit would be derived by these industries if this co operation could be continued and in creased The measurement of tem peratures and especially furnace tem peratures is a problem of increasing importance in the industries and many scientific investigations are con tinually arising in this connection The intelligent and efficient develop ment of aeronautics depends on the possession of full and reliable informa tion as to the properties of materials the accurate measurement of the per formance of machines experimental researches in mechanics and aerody namics and the most intelligent utili zation of existing and newly devel oped information The measurement of color and of illumination and of the optical properties of materials and the development of optical methods form together a field of investigation of great scientific and economic value The standardization of electrical ap paratus and machinery of electric batteries and of the materials used in their manufacture open a wide field for research It is impossible even to mention all the subjects of importance in this connection but enough has been said to show how vast the field and how practical the results that are obtained whenever science is appealedEXPENDITURES AND REVENUES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 107 to in answering the problems arising in the industries The high costs of the services of the plumber have been proverbial for years Standardization in plumbing fixtures and fittings and interchange ability of parts could be carried further than it has been This would greatly reduce the charges for time and mate rial in making repairs as well as in the original installation The enormous and confusing variety of lighting fix tures and the bad design of many are due to lack of standardization or cooip eration of the manufacturers with one another Inefficient and dangerous gas appliances have been sold to the public for years and many are still in use5 The manufacturers can not be blamed for they can not separately engage in expensive research to arrive at correct designs The only practica ble way is for all to coperate and for the government to take an active part helping the manufacturers to study these problems of design and standardi ization intelligently and thoroughly Such work is constructive and wealthproducing and yields large re turns upon the investment The bene fit is almost immediate and not only are there material returns in decreased costs and improved service but such coiperation between the government and the industries raises the standards of business and is helpful both to the government and to the industries It emphasizes good quality and good per formance and good service and re duces misrepresentation and exaggera tion in selling Is it not the duty of the government to cooiperate more ac tively in this constructive way with the industries No other agency can per 10 It has been estimated that the preventable loss in the use of natural gas on account of in efficient appliances and other wastage amounts to more than two hundred millions of dollars per year form this important function The government would do only a part of the work but that part is of great im portance Engineering societies man ufacturers organizations and individ ual manufacturing companies will do their part and in many cases the greater part But if the government refuses to do its part on the ground that it would increase taxation the public will not be satisfied with the reason given when it knows that at the present time out of approximately 5000 per capita per annum collected by the government for all purposes scarcely more than one cent per capita per annum is expended by the govern ment for standardization work and five cents per year per capita would accom plish much The matter is of so funda mental importance and promises re sults of so great economic and social value that it is to be hoped that some more adequate effort along this line may be made In Great Britain the Engineering Standards Association is largely fi nanced by the government while the Department of Scientific and Indus trial Research is a government body financed entirely by the government The work of these organizations is ex pected to be of great value to industry in that country and to be of service in developing its foreign trade The ac tivity of the government in this work lends value to the standards that re sult from it The American Engineer ing Standards Committee and the National Research Council of Amer ica on the other hand are financed entirely without government aid This is an additional reason why gov ernment research institutions in Amer ica should be so wellsupported that they can do their full duty in coopera tion with privately supported scientif ic and industrial institutions which are doing work in the interest of the pub108 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY lic and particularly standardization work of the kind in question Summary Reference is made to the criticisms of the departments of the government for their inefficiency and excessive cost and the need for greater economy and better management The suggestion is made that an examination of the ac tivities of the government and of the cost and useful results of the work in the various departments would show that unqualified criticisms are not jus tified and that the greatly increased costs are due mainly to the war and its consequences rather than to the ex pansion of the normal civil activities of the government The functions of government are classified into protective commercial and developmental and the fact noted that the developmental functions of the Federal Government tend to in crease because it is both logical and economical to have such work as is of general interest in all the states done either by the Federal Government with the cobperation of the states or by the states with the cobperation of the Federal Government Scientific and industrial research is noted as an important example of such develop mental work which is creative and wealthproducing and a necessity rather than a luxury The importance of taking account not only of actual expenditures by the government departments but also of receipts derived from earnings and sales of government property instead of looking only at appropriations is emphasized Examples are given showing the great difference between appropriations and actual net expenses payable from taxation In some cases departments or bureaus are nearly or quite selfsupporting The total of appropriations before the war as well as since were several hundred millions of dollars per year more than the net expenses payable from taxation A functional classification of the ac tivities of the Federal Government is given there being eight groups repre senting expenditures with revenues from taxation included in a ninth group The first three groups are civil and in 1920 represented 64 per cent of the total expenditures The five remaining groups are military pensions obligations arising from the war interest and reduction of the pub lic debt paying for the war all of which together represent 936 per cent of the total A detailed classification of the activi ties of the Federal Government is given under 106 items or headings fall ing into the eight groups referred to above A brief explanation of this classification is given with reasons in some cases for the assignments made Group I includes the essential govern mental activities legislative executive and judicial under fortynine headings Group II includes research education and developmental work under thirty one headings Group III includes con struction projects classed as public works under six headings The re maining twentysix headings fall into the other five groups mentioned in the preceding paragraph A balance sheet for each year of the eleven fiscal years 191020 is given showing revenues and net expendi tures in all the groups together with the net deficit or surplus for each year The three civil groups together had an average net expenditure of 211337 288 per year for the tenyear period 191019 equivalent to 214 per year per capita of the population of the country In 1920 this increased to 345 per capita for reasons given in the text and briefly mentioned below The cost of the war is calculated forEXPENDITURES AND REVENUES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 109 the four fiscal years 191720 by taking the actual expenses of the civil groups and adding the estimated cost of the military departments interest and pensions as they would have been if the war had not occurred based on pre war figures The excess of expendi tures not including loans to European governments and others over the nor mal expenditures so determined was 25982723219 and this may be taken as the direct cost of the war dur ing those four years The excess of revenue collected over the estimated normal expenditures was 11818699 300 which covered 455 per cent of the calculated cost of the war during the given fouryear period A brief but more specific statement is made of the functions and expendi tures of the various activities included under the fortynine headings of Group I with tables and illustrative figures The total net cost payable from taxa tion of all these activities including Congress the President and the various independent commissions Civil Serv ice Tariff Efficiency Interstate Com merce Federal Trade the District of Columbia etc Departments of State Treasury Post Office Justice part of the Departments of Interior Agricul ture Commerce and Labor the federal courts and penal establishments op eration of Panama Canal and public buildings etc was 105755525 per year average for the tenyear period or 107 per year per capita of the coun trys population In 1920 it was 211 per capita The total net expenditures for the activities included under research education and development in Group II including fifteen bureaus of the Department of Agriculture and fifteen bureaus or other agencies under In terior Commerce and Miscellaneous was 27838313 per year average for the tenyear period or 28 cents per year per capita In 1920 it was 54 cents per capita The net expenditure for the new con struction projects included as public works under Group III including river and harbor impovements Pan ama Canal new public buildings rec lamation service etc was 77743451 per year average for ten years or 79 cents per year per capita In 1920 it was 80 cents per capita The net expenditure for the Army and Navy Group IV averaged 256971389 per year for the seven years 191016 6302322105 per year for the three war years 191719 and 1348892747 for 1920 During the war years it averaged 25 times and in 1920 it was more than five times the prewar rate Pensions and care of soldiers Group V averaged 165439 944 before the war 191016 and in 1920 was 329261746 Obligations arising from the war Group VI were in the aggregate as follows for the four years 191720 Railroad Administration 1 534975574 Shipping Board 3217 239085 Food and Fuel Administration 170898189 Bureau of Industrial Housing and Transportation Council of National Defense Interdepartmental Social Hygiene Board and National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics 70916818

per cent in 1918 47 per cent in 1919 and 31 per cent in 1920 Interest payments less interest re ceived averaged during the seven years 191016 23605213 during the war years 191719 the average was 115853240 in 1920 it was 929131 128 The relatively small average dur ing the war years was partly because110 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY the war loans came mainly in the later years of this period and partly because of large credits from interests on Euro pean loans A comparison is made of the expen ditures of the civil branches of the government during the seven prewar years 191016 and the three war years 191719 Group I legislative execu tive and judicial increased from an average of 97718290 to 124509 073 or 26 per cent Group II increased from 25329328 to 33692610 or 33 per cent Group II decreased from an average of 85408910 to 59857380 or 30 per cent The total of the three groups averaged 208456528 before the war and 218059063 during the war an increase of less than 5 per cent During the same time the population of the country increased nearly 8 per cent so that the per capita cost of the three civil groups together was slightly less during the war than before and aver aged for the tenyear period 214 per year In 1920 the civil expenses increased to 345 per capita Group I increased 80 per cent Group II 70 per cent Group III 42 per cent The principal causes of increase in Group I were the large expansion of the Treasury Department largely on account of in creased activities arising from the war the large deficit in the Post Office Department because of increased com pensation of employes and the rail roads as contrasted with a surplus during thewar the increased compensa tion of employes in all other depart ments the increased cost of all kinds of material and supplies and the growth of the government The increases in the Treasury and Post Office account for 79 per cent of the total increase all other departments and commissions 21 per cent Of the increase in Group II half was on account of the census of 19920 which is temporary onefourth was in agriculture and the remainder in all the other activities In Group III there was an increase of 178 millions in rivers and harbors and of 235 mil lions in highway construction and de creases in all the other items the total net increase being 252 millions or 492 per cent In the six years 191015 the aver age federal taxation was 663 per capita of the population of the coun try of which 219 or 33 per cent was expended for the civil activities in cluded in Groups I II and III In 1916 the per capita taxation was 708 of which 200 or 28 per cent was for civil expenses In 1917 taxation was 992 per capita of which 196 or 920 per cent was spent for civil purposes In 1918 taxation was 3766 per capita and 215 or 57 per cent was for civil purposes In 1919 taxation was 3881 of which 221 or 57 per cent was for civil purposes In 1920 taxation was 5346 per capita of which 345 or 64 per cent was for civil purposes The average taxation for state govern mental purposes throughout the forty eight states of the Union in 1918 was 448 per capita The average taxa tion for municipal government in New York Chicago and Philadelphia in 1918 was 3022 per capita For all cities of over 30000 population for eight years 191018 it averaged 9310 per capita while net expense averaged 2621 The various functions of the Federal Government are reviewed in compari son with those outlined on pages 2 and 3 in order to see to what extent the Fed eral Government is doing the things that would naturally fall to it in the dis tribution of functions between federal state and municipal The conclusion is that the developmental functions in which the primary aim is service rather than control and the work is cooip erative and educational rather thanEXPENDITURES AND REVENUES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 111 administrative and governmental are capable of great extension without con flicting with the rights or responsibili ties of the states and municipalities or with private initiative The employment policy of the gov ernment is examined and some legal handicaps to efficiency discussed Statutory positions with fixed and often inadequate salaries make it dif ficult to develop an efficient personnel the inequality of salaries in different branches of the service causing dissat isfaction and increasing the frequency of transfer gave rise to legislation restricting transfers and promotions by transfer A classified and standard ized civil service is greatly needed and it is hoped that it will be realized in the near future A Con gressional Commission has classified the service in the District of Columbia and two bills have been introduced into Congress embodying the results of this classification The war brought a great many addi tional employes into the government service but the number has been con siderably reduced during the past year A comparison of the number in the service on July 31 1920 with June 30 1916 showed that the increases were mainly in the Army and Navy War Risk Insurance Shipping Board Rail road Administration and in the Treas ury and State Departments the func tions of which have largely increased on account of the war The Post Office in creased in four years from 250885 to 279072 an increase of 28187 or 112 per cent The personnel in Washing ton and throughout the country in the Departments of Interior Agriculture Commerce Justice Labor the Panama Canal Government Printing Office Interstate Commerce Commission and miscellaneous bodies that is all activi ties of the three groups I II and III included in the executive departments except Treasury and State increased in four years from 81376 to 84825 a difference of only 3449 or 42 per cent In these fouryears the population of the country had increased more than 5 per cent The turnover in the personnel meantime has been excessive and a large part of the employes are hence relatively inexperienced This answers the criticism of excessive personnel in these departments and explains in large measure their reduced efficiency One of the reasons that makes it dif ficult to maintain a high standard of personnel and of efficiency in the government service in Washington is the high cost of living and the resultant skrinkage in the purchasing power of salaries in recent years This skrinkage is only partially covered by the war bonus which does not apply at all in the higher grades of the service The re cent fall in prices and reduction in the cost of living relieves the situation somewhat but if the proposed in creases of salary were made there would still be a considerable margin between the new salary scale and what it would have to be to cover the actual increase to date in living costs since 1913 Much has been said about duplica tion in the government service and the reduced efficiency caused thereby Examples of alleged duplication are discussed such as gathering of statis tics map making scieitific research engineering work and administration and investigation in the interest of pub lic health Although there is undoubt edly room for improvement in many cases nevertheless in most cases there is good cotiperation among the various departments and bureaus concerned and much of the socalled duplication is really only apparent It is believed that the work is more efficiently car ried on in most cases than if it were concentrated in one place112 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY The value of research and standard ization in making the government effi cient and effective is pointed out It is important to have as complete knowl edge as possible concerning the prob lems encountered in the administra tion of the government such as those involved in the construction of public buildings and other public works in making contracts for supplies in in specting and accepting deliveries on contracts in collecting the revenue in discussing proposed legislation in en forcing the law The cotiperation of the Federal Government with states and municipalities so as to make such information available to all would be helpful to good government The mil itary value of such research is consid erable as it would aid in purchases of instruments and materials and in the solution of military problems and would develop scientific methods equipment and men available for re search in time of war The co6iperation of the government in the work of preparing safety codes building codes and public utility stand ards which are adopted and enforced by states and municipalities and used by the industries as standards of good practice even if not formally adopted by any administrative agency is of the greatest importance These codes are sometimes prepared by a single state or city and sometimes cotipera tively by the joint effort of the gov ernment engineering societies the in dustrial and public utility interests and the states and municipalities The problems are much the same in all the states and hence the cotiperative method is economical and favors standardization many states and cities and many industries can thus use the same codes and standards or substan tially the same and so avoid duplica tion of effort and confusion of practice Such work is constructive and helpful promotes industrial and governmental efficiency and should be encouraged and developed Industrial research and standardiza tion for the purpose of improving methods and reducing waste in the in dustries is another kind of creative and wealthproducing work which the gov ernment should carry on more ac tively The problem of increasing pro duction and reducing costs without increasing the length of the working day or reducing wages below an Amer ican standard of living is a funda mental one Such work will stimulate industry promote our foreign trade elevate business methods and bring about a better understanding between the government and business Cotip eration in business is increasing constantly and codperation between the government and business in im proving methods and increasing effi ciency in manufacturing and distribu tion and in solving many other problems of business can not fail to be beneficial and profitable CONCLUSION Probably everyone will grant that the government should do more than it has yet done to raise the standard of its personnel to improve its methods to increase its efficiency to develop the public domain to cooperate with industry to create wealth to give the maximum of service to the people As the war has greatly increased the national budget and the industrial de pression has emphasized the demand for a reduction of the burden of taxa tion the question arises as to whether the government can do the things that are needed In this discussion no opinion is expressed as to the relative proportion of the total expenditures that should properly be devoted to military and civil purposes It is however urged that the primary func113 tions of governmentlegislative exec utive and judicialare essential and the agencies through which they are exercised should be made as efficient and effective as possible that research education and development are not only necessary to the public welfare and helpful to commerce and industry but they are creative and wealthpro ducing and tend to lighten rather than increase the burdens of taxation and that the money put into public works if wisely expended is a profitable in vestment which aids materially in the development of the public domain and the country as a whole As all of these activities together represented in 1990 only 64 per cent of the taxes collected they would amount to less than 90 per cent of the whole if the ex penditures for these purposes were doubled and the total of taxes col lected were reduced by onethird That would make possible a great in crease in the constructive service and welfare work of the government and still leave more than three billion dollars per year for military expendi tures pensions interest and the re duction of the public debt

others of a similar tenor mark a change of opinion on the part of the director of the New York station or are only a clearer expression of convictions previously held we do not un dertake to say In either case we are glad to see the weight of this important institution cast in favor of the scientific conception of an experimentstation The great need of agri culture today is not new varieties of plants or improved breeds of animals new methods of cultivating the soil or improved systems of farming All these and many other like things are good but the two great wants are a better knowledge of principles and great er intelligence to apply them For the latter we must look to our agricultural schools the former we should require from our experiment stations We do not hold that an experimentstation should never undertake to originate or test new varieties of plants and animals or new agricultural methods often work of this gen eral character will be demanded of it by the public and will prove of great public utility but in our view it should not be allowed to be or to appear to be the chief end of the station The two kinds of work are both important but we question the advisability of attempting to unite them in one institution and under one management Each requires facilities and talents peculiar to itself and it seems doubtful whether as a rule one insti tution will be able to provide good facilities for both kinds of experimentation and still more doubtful whether it can find combined in one person the diverse knowledge and training re quired for their successful prosecution With the growth of agricultural experimentation there might profitably be we suspect in the majority of cases a subdivision of it into two overlapping yet independent classes We should have first the experimentstation prop er aiming chiefly at a further elucidation of NCE 509 the laws and principles underlying agriculture and second the experimental farm devoted mainly to carrying out upon a farming scale the principles worked out by the experiment station LETTERS TO THE EDITOR  Correspondents are requested to be as brief as possible The writers name is in all cases required as proof of good faith Psychical research Youn issue of Oct 17 contained two articles which are of good omen for the future of psychical re search in America Of the first the editorial arti cle I need say little It is cordially welcomed by my colleagues and myself for its recognition of the far reaching importance of an enterprise in the further development of which our society will we hope go hand in hand with yours With the second article on psychic force our agreement is less complete but we still find nothing to complain of in the general attitude of the distinguished writer He too rec ognizes the legitimacy of the inquiry while clearly apprehending its difficulties He describes with en tire justice the two opposed classes between which psychical research has to clear a path  the party of easy credulity and the party of easy incredulity and he points out with no more than proper empha sis the rigorous caution which every forward step demands Fraud and superstition have naturally seized on what science has so systematically neg lected and those who now endeavor to take the subject up from the scientific side must accept the fact and its consequences So far then we are wholly at one with Professor Newcomb but we cannot quite so readily follow him in his criticisms of our own doings Hie begins by condemnirng one of our public appeals for infor nation but his strictures seem to assume that all the information which the appeal brings in will be re garded by us as a safe basis for conclusions The appeal is of course merely a first step for which it would be difficult to imagine any effective substitute though I lmay mention that a very large amount of our information comes to us through private chan nels The sifting and treatment of the evidence according to scientific canons must be a subsequent labor the rationale of which could not be set forth or even suggested in the terms of a short advertise ment And of this labor no portion is more imnpor tant than the one which we are glad to filid Professor Newcomb so explicitly recognizing  the application of the doctrine of cliances In all those branches of our inquiry where questions of coincidence occur it is clearly essential to ascertain as definitely as may be how far the coincidences may fairly be ascribed to chance We have taken and are still taking great pains to obtain this definite infornmation Very wide inquiries have been made and the results though far from complete may still I think claim decidedly more validity as a basis of computation tlan Pro fessor Newcombs guess at what  any physician will consider quite within the bounds of probability It would require more space tlan I can ask for to conmment on Professor Newcombs numerical argu ment in detail But I may remark that he seems to confuse the arrgument by classing all together what lie calls  dreams illusions visions etc at least if510 S CIE he means to include in this heterogeneous group visual hallucinations of waking persons which we regard as by far the most important phenomena from an evidential point of view If any one in his waking moments experiences apparitions of human forms as often as once a week which is the degree of frequency that Professor Newcortbs calculation assumes it is obvious that the approximate coinci dence of one of these apparitions with the death of the corresponding human being will be an insignifi cant accident But we have not ourselves met with any specimen of this class We have collected more than a hundred firsthand cases of apparitions closely coinciding with the time of death of the person seen and it is only in a small minority of such cases that our informants according to their own account have had any other hallucination than the apparition in question The following sketch may serve to show the lines on which our own reasoning in the matter will pro ceed We are making a census which so far shows that in this country the proportion of sane persons in good health and awake who within the last ten years have had a visual hallucination representing some living person known to them is about one in three hundred Now let us make a supposition far below the actual mark and confine the number of the acquaintances of each of these hallucinated per sons to five Let us further suppose that one of these five persons does actually die in the course of the ten years This seems fair on the whole for though in some cases more than one may die within that time in others none may die According to this estimate then the chance that the death will take place within twelve hours of the apparition will be one in 365 x 2 x 10 x 5 that is one in 36500 in other words only one out of every 36500 of the hallucinated persons will in the course of ten years hit off the coinci dence by chance But since the hallucinated persons are only a threehundredth of the whole population this means that the proportion of the whole popu lation who will by chance have an apparition of a person known to them within twelve hours of that persons death is only one in 10950000 Now we ourselves have a large collection of such recent cases resting on good firsthand testimony but let us put the number far below the mark and say thirty cases If then these thirty coincidences are to be fairly at tributed to chance the population of the country will have to be 328500000 But we cannot suppose that our appeal for evidence has reached the whole population and we shall be making a sober estimate if we reckon that within the given time ten times as many cases must have occurred as those we happen to have encountered This brings the necessary population up to 3285000000 and the number will be further immensely increased if we take count of the fact that many of the coincidences are extremely close that the times of the two events fall not only within twelve hours but within one Thus the theory that chance would account for the cases could only be justified if the population of the country were several hundred times what it actually is The re ductio ad absurdum seems tolerably complete The case of dreams is of course very different We are most of us constantly dreaming A very large number of odd coincidences between dreams and external events is certain to occur by mere chance and the cases are rare where the correspondence is of a kind which strongly suggests telepathic influences Here therefore Professor Newcombs estimate is far more applicable and we have always felt that dreams by themselves could not be expected to afford conclu NCa YIo IV No 96 sive proof of telepathy This however does not seem a sufficient reason for ignoring them since if the fact of telepathic communication be otherwise established they may throw light which we could ill afford to neglect on the nature of the mental and cerebral processes involved As regards haunted houses we readily admit and have expressly pointed out the far greater uncertainty of the evidence as compared with the best telepathic cases But even here we differ from Professor New comb in seeing a distinction between the experiences which we deem of some prima facie importance and the experience which he supposes when a person lying awake an hour after midnight hears some sound the cause of which is beyond his power to auess Sounds are the very weakest sort of evidence What strength the prima facie case has depends not on things heard but on things seen and seen not by one person only but by several independently and at different times and as the seers affirm without any knowledge on their part that the house was supposed to be  haunted Professor Newcombs concluding remarks dealing with the experimental side of telepathy deserve care ful attention But his objections here rest entirely on the hypothesis of visual and auditory indications consciously or unconsciously given by the agent to the percipient and though it is difficult I know to convince persons who have not been present that sufficient precautions have been taken to eliminate this source of error it must surely be admitted that such precautions are possible As regards sight no one will deny the possibility and as regards hear ing we think that if a careful watch is kept the means of communication resolve themselves into slight variations of breathing Such variations were never detected in our experiments and in any case could hardly be supposed capable of rapidly convey ing to the percipients mind the form of an irregular diagram and the difficulty would be increased in cases where the signs would have had to be uncon scious as in many of our experiments where we were able not only to vary the agent but to act our selves as agents As for indications whether the subject is going right or wrong they must of course be prevented by taking care that the agent shall not watch what the percipient is doing Most of the spurious thoughtreading of the willinggame  would be prevented if the willer instead of the willed were effectively blindfolded But we find ourselves once more wholly in sympa thy with Professor Newcomb when he insists that the experiments must be repeated again and again under the strictest conditions before we can reason ably expect thoughttransference to be accepted as an established scientific fact So far from resenting the demand for more evidence we are ourselves un ceasingly reiterating it Tihe responsibility for such novel observations cannot be too widely spread and glad indeed shall we be to shift some of it to Ameri can shoulders EDMUND GURNEY Hlon sec of the Societyj or psychical research 14 Deans yard Westminster SW Nov 4 MIr Gurneys letter suggests many interesting reflections on the probabilities involved in questions of telepathic phenomena and I hope for an early opportunity to engage in a further discussion of the subject in the columns of Science This will natu rally involve the consideration of the points raised in his letter Meanwhile there are two numerical data I  r   17DETCEliMBER 5 1884 SCIE and if he would favor me with them I should feel much flattered  firstly his estimate from the census results of the number of persons of the age of fifteen and upwards resident in the British Islands whose statements he would consider prima facie entitled to full credence to guide him I may remark that I see no reason why the number should not be from ten to twenty millions secondly his estimate of the probability that one of these persons taken at ran dom would not be above amusing himself or herself at the expense of a society so eminent as that of which Mr Gurney is the honorary anid honored secretary These numbers will come into my discussion and I should much rather have them from an authority conversant with the subject than attempt to guess at them myself SIMON NEWcOMB Change in the color of the eye The experience of Mr T F McCurdy p 452 is I imagine a not uncommon one It certainly finds illustration in my own family and in myself the iris which was quite black in childhood having for many years visibly lightened until it is more correctly de scribed as gray with shades of hazel The fadingout of black eyes with age is a matter of common obser vation and the change judging from the facts within my own knowledge is more apt to occur where the individual takes after a grandparent who had the dark eye and where the immediate parents had blue or gray C V RILEY Washington DC Specimens illustrating Lehmanns  Origin of the crystalline schists It may not be uninteresting to the geological read ers of Science to know that the writer has recently received through the kindness of Professor Johannes Lehmann of the University of Breslau a very valua ble suite of rock specimens illustrative of the latters new and important work on the origin of the crystal line schists noticed in Science No 86 p 327 and in the American journal of science for November 1884 p 392 Tllese specimens are sixtythree in number and were collected partly by Professor Lelimann him self and partly under his immediate supervision in the granulite area of Saxony and in those parts of Bavaria which he has nmade the subject of his special study They exhibit in an excellent manner nearly all those phenomena ascribed by the author of the above memoir to metamorphism by pressure espe cially however the changes which certain massive pyroxene rocks of Saxony have undergone in becom ing hornblendic schists exactly analogous to similar alterations traced by the present writer in the rocks near Baltimore To all students of metamorphism and of structural geology in highly crystalline regions this work must be of absorbiing interest as undoubtedly the most advanced of its kind and in spite of its superb atlas of most satisfactory photographic illustrations its readers may be glad to know that this suite of origi nal specimens is in the petrograpllical laboratory of the Johns Hopkins university where it will always be accessible to such persons as may be interested in examining it Geo H WILLIAMS Baltimore Nov 25 Botflies in a turtle Some days ago Prof T Robinson of Howard uni versity called my attention to a boxturtle Cistudo NCE 511 carolina which had in the muscles on either side of the neck about thirteen large botfly larvae The turtle Was alive but evidently suffered inconvenience from the intruders which had taken up their abode at a point from which they could not be dislodged by claw or beak They were removed with forceps and sent to Mr Howard of the agricultural bureau who informed me that they belonged to tlhe family Oestri dae and to a genus probably undescribed IHe also brought to my attention an exactly parallel case re ported in the American naturalist xvi 598 about two years ago by Prof A S Packard FREDERICK W TRUE U S national museum Washington Nov 24 On the function of the serrated appendages of the throat of Amia Through the kindness of Prof B G Wilder I have at present two living specimens of Amia which I pro pose to employ shortly in a comparative study of the brains of American ganoids My attention was first attracted to the serrated appendages of the throat by Professor Wilders own note upon the subject published in the Proc Amer assoc 1876 and more recently by a reference to the same structures in one of Sagemehls admirable con tributions to the anatomy of fishes Morph jahrb x 63 Sagemehl concludes from the examination of alcoholic specimens that these  flagella  are during life in constant motion and thus help to renew the water in the gillcavity Such is by no means the case The  flagella are attached by their bases to the lateral aspects of the sternohyoid muscles hyo pectorales of McMurrich the chief function of which is to enlarge the cavity of the mouth When these muscles are at rest the flagella lie flat along their surfaces when they contract the cavity of the mouth is enlarged the flagella erected and the gill covers pushed outwarls At the suggestion of my assistant Mr A B Macallurn we stimulated the prox imnal part of the muscle with the result of a perfect demonstration of the above facts The flagella thus help to replace functionally the absent dilatator mus cles of the gillcovers A strip of condensed tissue occupies a precisely similar position on the hyopec toral muscle of Amniurus perhaps a rudiment of similar organs possessed by the ancestors of the silu roids before the differentiation of the dilatator mus cles of the operculum My specimens of Amia after being in captivity for some time became very sluggish and hardly any movements of respiration could be detected After the fish had been removed for a little out of the water however and then returned to it the move ments were sufficiently active to disclose the follow ing facts  Duriing the enlargement and filling of the cavity of the mouth the posterior flexible and muscular bor der of the gillcover is tightly applied to the soft parts behind the gillopening When the mouth cavity is quite full the mouth closes the muscular border of the gillcover releases its suckerlike hold of tlle soft parts and the water is driven out by the contraction of the walls of the mouthcavity Professor Wilders account of the structure of the serrated appendages is so complete as to render any further reference to this subject unnecessary R RAMSAY WRIGHT University college Toronto Nov 27

j100168,Harvard Law Review,1322896,The Metaphysical Nature of a Corporation in the Eye of the Law,i256921,THE METAPHYSICAL NATURE OF A CORPORATION IN THE EYE OF THE LAW  From the point of view of the man in the street a corporation is ob viously a fiction But this does not settle whether it is a fiction or a reality in the eye of the law In a recent English article Mr E Hilton Young has given an interesting discussion of the question in which he contends that while in theory a corporation exists only in the contemplation of the law which creates it in practice it has become a real legal being apart therefrom The Legal Per sonality of a Foreign Cor oration 22 L Quar Rev 178 April I906 His argumnent is in brief that a foreign corporation in theory does not exist outside of the sovereignty which creates it Yet the courts of other sovereignties permit it to sue as plaintiff and obtain personal jurisdiction of it as defendant A court cannot obtain personal jurisdiction of that which in the eye of the law does not exist Consequently whatever the theory may be for practical pur poses a foreign corporation is a real legal being While the American authorities are in confusion the general result seems to be a similar conflict between theory and practice Indeed the seeds of it are found in Chief Justice Marshalls definition of a corporation as an artificial being   existing only in contemplation of law See Dartmouth CollTe v Woodward 4 Wheat U S 5I8 636 This definition has been approved by the weight of American authority But metaphysically it seems to involve a contradiction A being ex hyAothesi exists A being which at the same time exists and dos not exist is certainly a peculiar metaphysical concept Yet this is precisely the result reached by the cases In theory a corporation in the jurisdiction which creates it is essentially a legal entity apart from the individ ual stockholders composing it The word  person  in a statute has been held sufficiently to describe it See Peopile v ltica itns Co 5 Johns N Y 358 For purposes of federal jurisdiction it has been held to be a  citizen  of the state which creates it See Aashua I Lowell R R Corp5 v Boston  Lowell R R Corf 136 U S 356 And yet courts of equity may rarely where justice requires it look behind the legal entity to the individual stock holders See Moore  Handley Hardware Co v Tower Hardware Co 87 Ala 206 A corporation then is generally regarded as existing in the state which creates it But it is equally well settled that since a corporation exists only in contem plation of the law it has no legal existence outside the state where that law operates See Augusta Bank v Earle 13 Pet U S 5T9 588 Neverthe less under the proper circumstances it may contract in another state by means of agents and the courts thereof may by comity treat it as existent and permit it to sue on the contract See Augvusta Bank v Earle sufra But a foreign corporation may equally commit a tort or a nuisance See Austin v N Y  E R R 25 N J Law 38 Seattle Gas  Electric Co v Citizens L  P Co 123 Fed Rep 588 Comity however cannot give jurisdiction of a non existent corporation when those aggrieved desire to serve it Consequently in the absence of statute it is imnpossible to bring action in iersozarn against a foreign corporation See MIiddlebrooks v Springfteld Ins Co 14 Conn 301 In the absence of statute therefore it can act but cannot be brought to account But a corporation though a  citizen  of its own state for purposes of jurisdic tion is not a  citizen  within the meaning of article 4  2 of the United States Constitution which declares that  the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states See Ducat v City of Chicago 48 Ill 172 Consequently a state may lay down the condi tions under which a foreign corporation may do business therein See Paul v Vbiunia 8 Wall U S i68 Most of our states have therefore passed statutes compelling foreign corporations which do business within the state toBOOKS AND PERIODICALS 79 submit to the jurisdiction of the courts See 6 THOMP CORP  79I The total result apparently is that a corporation exists within its own state in theory but not always in practice while in a foreign state it does not exist in theory although in practice it is often treated as if it did Metaphysically therefore it seems very like a nonexistent being ABUSED PRIVILEGE AN W A Purrinigton Maintaining that the privilege accorded a physiciani of not testifving is greatly abused 6 Columbia

HIGH SCHOOL UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO ADMINISTRATION OF THE COURSEDURING THE LAST FOUR YEARS EXPERI MENTAL COURSES IN THE COMBINATION OF ENGLISH AND SOCIAL SCIENCE HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON IN THE LABORATORY SCHOOLS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO AT THE PRESENT TIME A FULL YEAR OF SUCH WORK IS REQUIRED OF ALL PUPILS IN EITHER THE JUNIOR OR SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL THE COURSE IS ORGANIZED IN UNITS OF ONE SEMESTER EACH KNOWN AS COMMUNITY LIFE I AND COMMUNITY LIFE II AS A RULE A SEMESTER OF STANDARD ENGLISH INSTRUCTION INTERVENES BETWEEN THE TWO UNITS BY THIS ARRANGEMENT GREATER VARIETY IS SECURED IN THE WORK AND CLASSES CAN BE TRANSFERRED WITHOUT ADMINISTRATIVE DIFFICULTY TO THE TEACHERS WHO ARE ESPECIALLY QUALIFIED TO PRESENT THE TWO TYPES OF ENGLISH COMMUNITY LIFE I IS TAKEN BY FIRSTYEAR PUPILS COMMUNITY LIFE II BY SECONDYEAR PUPILS AS ORGANIZED AT PRESENT THE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO IS COMPOSED LARGELY OF CHILDREN WHO HAVE COMPLETED THE SIXYEAR COURSE OF STUDY IN THE UNIVERSITY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL FEW PUPILS FROM OUTSIDE SCHOOLS ARE ADMITTED SUCH PUPILS HOWEVER MAY ENTER THE SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL AFTER GRADUATION FROM THE EIGHTH GRADE AS A RESULT THE PUPILS IN THE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL TAKE ENGLISH WITH COMMUNITYLIFE CONTENT WHILE IN THE SEVENTH AND EIGHTH GRADES PUPILS WHO ENTER FROM OTHER SCHOOLS HOWEVER TAKE THE COURSE IN THE NINTH AND TENTH GRADES THE ILLUSTRATIONS USED IN THESE ARTICLES ARE DRAWN FOR THE MOST PART FROM THE WORK OF THE LASTNAMED PUPILS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SCHOOL YEAR ALL PUPILS IN THE TWO LOWER CLASSES OF THE HIGH SCHOOL BOTH JUNIOR AND SENIOR ARE PLACED IN RAPID MEDIUM AND SLOW SECTIONS CALLED SECTIONS A B AND C IN I CERTAIN PHASES OF THE COURSE IN THE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ARE DESCRIBED IN A SUG GESTIVE WAY BY THE INSTRUCTOR IN CHARGE MISS EDITH SHEPHERD IN SOME SILENT READING LESSONS IN JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH SCHOOL REVIEW XXIX MARCH 1921 20615 24COMMUNITY LIFE AND ENGLISH 25 ORDER TO MAKE POSSIBLE A DIFFERENTIATION IN INSTRUCTION IN COMFORMITY WITH THE VARYING NEEDS OF THE PUPILS THIS CLASSIFICATION IS MADE ON THE BASIS OF SPEED AND COMPREHENSION IN READING IN THE CASE OF ENTERING NINTHGRADE PUPILS AS REVEALED BY A SERIES OF TESTS GIVEN DURING THE FIRST WEEK OF SCHOOL PUPILS WHO HAVE BEEN MEMBERS OF THE SCHOOL ARE GROUPED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE QUALITY OF THEIR WORK THE PRECEDING YEAR OBJECTIVES OF THE COURSETHIS EXPERIMENT IN SOCIALSCIENCE ENGLISH WAS PROMPTED BY THE BELIEF THAT SUCH A COMBINATION WOULD ADD VITALITY AND HUMAN INTEREST TO CIVICS INSTRUCTION THAT IT WOULD ENRICH THE WORK IN ENGLISH THAT IT WOULD TEND TO MAKE EFFECTIVE EXPRESSION HABITUAL INSTEAD OF SPASMODIC THAT IT WOULD AWAKEN OR STIMULATE IN BOYS AND GIRLS A GENUINE LIKING FOR GOOD BOOKS AND THAT IF SUCCESSFUL IT WOULD PROVIDE ONE WAY BY WHICH SCHOOL ADMINIS TRATORS MIGHT FIND RELIEF FROM AN OVERCROWDED CURRICULUM THE CHIEF AIMS OF THE COURSE THEN ARE FIRST TO AROUSE IN PUPILS A DESIRE TO TAKE A HELPFUL PART IN THE ACTIVITIES OF THE VARIOUS GROUPS OF WHICH THEY ARE MEMBERS SECOND TO ACQUAINT THEM WITH A BODY OF KNOWL EDGE ABOUT SOCIETY AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATION SUCH AS WILL ENABLE THEM TO PLAY THEIR PARTS WELL THIRD TO INDUCE IN THEM HABITS OF EXTENSIVE AND PURPOSEFUL READING OF MANY KINDS OF WORTHY LITERATURE FOURTH TO STIMULATE CLEAR FLUENT AND EFFECTIVE EXPRESSION IN BOTH ORAL AND WRITTEN COMPOSITION AND FIFTH TO AWAKEN OR ENLARGE GENUINE INTEL LECTUAL INTERESTS THE FIRST TWO AIMS ARE PRIMARILY CIVIC IN CHAR ACTER THE NEXT TWO ARE ORDINARILY THOUGHT OF AS FALLING WITHIN THE REALM OF ENGLISH THE LAST WHILE IN NO SENSE RESTRICTED TO EITHER BRANCH OF KNOWLEDGE MAY BE REGARDED AS BELONGING TO BOTH SINCE THIS DISCUSSION CONSIDERS PRIMARILY THE UTILITY OF SOCIAL SCIENCE MATERIAL FOR INSTRUCTION IN ENGLISH ATTENTION WILL BE CONFINED IN LARGE PART TO THOSE FEATURES OF THE COURSE WHICH RELATE TO THE THIRD SA LIST OF THE TESTS AND A DESCRIPTION OF THE DIFFERENTIATED INSTRUCTION IN ENGLISH BASED UPON THE FINDINGS MAY BE FOUND IN AN ARTICLE ENTITLED DIFFERENTIATING INSTRUC TION IN NINTHGRADE ENGLISH SCHOOL REVIEW XXVII DECEMBER 1919 77288  MORE SPECIFICALLY IT WOULD CONSTITUTE ONE STEP TOWARD THE FULFILMENT OF THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE COMMITTEE ON SOCIAL STUDIES OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SECONDARY SCHOOL PRINCIPALS THAT SOCIAL STUDIES BE GIVEN THE TIME OF ONEHALF UNIT A YEAR IN EACH OF THE YEARS FROM THE SEVENTH GRADE THROUGH THE TWELFTH THE REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE MAY BE FOUND IN SCHOOL REVIEW XXVIII APRIL 1920 2839726 THE SCHOOL REVIEW JANUARY AND FOURTH OBJECTIVES LISTED ABOVE THE OTHERS WILL BE TREATED ONLY INCIDENTALLY THE PRESENT ARTICLE WILL BE LIMITED TO A DISCUSSION OF WHAT MAY BE CALLED THE READING PHASES OF THE COURSE A LATER ARTICLE WILL BE DEVOTED TO THE PART ORAL AND WRITTEN EXPRESSION HAVE IN THE WORK READING AND THE ANALYTICAL METHOD OF INSTRUCTIONAS INDICATED IT WAS FELT THAT SUCH A COMBINATION COURSE WOULD BOTH VITALIZE CIVICS AND ENRICH ENGLISH THIS APPEARED TO BE ESPECIALLY POSSIBLE IN THE CASE OF READING IN THE MAJORITY OF CIVICS COURSES THE READINGMATTER IS WHOLLY INFORMATIONAL IN CHARACTER COMPOSED AS A RULE OF HIGHLY CONDENSED ABSTRACTIONS OR GENERALIZATIONS MUCH OF THIS MATERIAL IS UNINTELLIGIBLE TO ORDINARY BOYS AND GIRLS IN THEIR EYES IT IS ALSO ABOUT THE DRYEST STUFF IN THE CURRICULUM AS ONE PUPIL PUT IT IN A REPORT OF READING DONE IN A MUCHUSED TEXT IT WAS SO CONDENSED BECAUSE OF THAT IT WAS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO READ I DID NOT ENJOY IT BECAUSE IT TOOK SUCH AN EFFORT TO DIGEST ALL THE MEANING OF EACH PARAGRAPH IN MOST ENGLISH CLASSES ON THE OTHER HAND READING IS CON FINED TO THE CLASSICS WHICH IN GENERAL ARE STUDIED IN AN ANALYTICAL MANNER THE PURPOSE OF SUCH STUDY IS USUALLY THE CULTIVATION OF AN APPRECIATION OF GOOD LITERATURE IF BY APPRECIATION IS MEANT A LIKING FOR GOOD LITERATURE IS THE GOAL USUALLY REALIZED HOW MANY BOYS FOR EXAMPLE ARE SO INSPIRED BY THEIR STUDY OF IVANHOE THAT THEY VOLUNTARILY READ THE REST OF THE WAVERLEY NOVELS OR HOW MANY GIRLS ARE SO STIMULATED BY AN ANALYSIS OF MACBETH THAT THEY EAGERLY PERUSE THE OTHER PLAYS OF SHAKESPEARE  LET HIM WHO DOUBTS THE ANSWER STAND AT THE COUNTER OF A PUBLIC LIBRARY FOR AN HOUR AND NOTE THE BOOKS DRAWN BY HIGHSCHOOL PUPILS OR BETTER LET HIM ASK THE BOYS AND GIRLS THEMSELVES SURELY THE TEST OF BEHAVIOR IS A FAIR CRITERION AND IF YOUNG PEOPLE DO NOT CARE TO READ TENNYSON AND THACKERAY AND SCOTT AND SHAKESPEARE IN THEIR LEISURE HOURSAND THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THEY DO NOTTHE CON CLUSION IS INEVITABLE THAT FOR SOME REASON THE OBJECTIVE OF INSTILLING A LIKING FOR THE CLASSICS THROUGH AN ANALYTICAL STUDY OF SUCH LITERATURE IN CLASS IS NOT ORDINARILY ATTAINED THE SEAT OF THE DIFFICULTY OF COURSE IS NOT IN THE AIM FEW WILL QUESTION THE DESIRABILITY OR THE NEED OF CULTIVATING AN APPRECIA1922 COMMUNITY LIFE AND ENGLISH 27 TION OF GOOD LITERATURE NOR WILL ANYONE DENY THE LITERARY MERITS OF ELIOT SCOTT AND TENNYSON ALTHOUGH THE INTRODUCTION OF CERTAIN OF THEIR WRITINGS WITHIN GIVEN GRADES MAY BE CHALLENGED MUCH MORE DIFFICULT IS IT TO JUSTIFY THE ANALYTICAL METHOD OF STUDY WHICH IS STILL IN VOGUE IN MANY SCHOOLS AND THE SCANT CONSIDERATION WHICH IS USUALLY GIVEN TO SUCH WORTHWHILE FIELDS OF LITERATURE AS TRAVEL BIOGRAPHY AND HISTORY THE UTILIZATION OF PROPER SELECTIONS FROM THESE FIELDS IT IS BELIEVED WILL BOTH VITALIZE CIVICS AND ENRICH THE STUDY OF LITERATURE WITH REFERENCE TO THE ANALYTICAL METHOD OF INSTRUCTION WHICH IS EMPLOYED SO GENERALLY IN THE TEACHING OF ENGLISH AND THE SOCIAL SCIENCES IT MAY BE NOTED THAT WITH OCCASIONAL EXCEPTIONS BOYS AND GIRLS OF JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL AGE HAVE NOT YET DEVELOPED AN ANALYTICAL ATTITUDE OF MIND THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN TEARING IVANHOE TO PIECES IN DISSECTING THE CHARACTER OF SHYLOCK OR IN TRACING TO THEIR SOURCES THE HISTORICAL AND MYTHOLOGICAL ALLUSIONS IN WHICH LITERATURE ABOUNDS ON THE CONTRARY THEIR INTEREST IS PRIMARILY IN THINGS IN THE LARGE IN THE STORY IN ACTION IN SHORT IN EXTENSIVE NOT INTENSIVE READING THE TEACHER OF CIVICS WHO CONFINES HIS COURSE TO A TEXTBOOK FAILS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS INTEREST AND FALLS INTO A METHOD OF INSTRUCTION CLOSELY AKIN TO THAT WHICH HAS JUST BEEN DESCRIBED A TEXT AT BEST FURNISHES AN UTTERLY INADEQUATE AMOUNT OF READING MATTER FOR BOYS AND GIRLS NINTHGRADE PUPILS FOR EXAMPLE CAN READ ON THE AVERAGE FROM 250 TO 300 WORDS A MINUTE IN ORDINARY EXPOSITORY OR NARRATIVE MATERIAL THE LARGEST JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL TEXT IN CIVICS NOW AVAILABLE CONTAINS BARELY FIVE HUNDRED PAGES OF READINGMATTER WHEN ALLOWANCE IS MADE FOR ILLUSTRATIONS IT IS FOUND THAT IN GENERAL EACH OF THESE PAGES CONTAINS FROM 250 TO 300 WORDS THE ORDINARY PUPIL CAN WITHOUT DIFFICULTY THEREFORE READ THE ENTIRE BOOK IN FROM EIGHT TO TEN HOURS WHAT DOES HE DO WITH THE REST OF HIS TIME  IF HE SPENDS IT IN STUDY HE MUST READ THE SAME MATERIAL OVER AND OVER AGAIN OR HE MUST EMPLOY IT IN PREPARING OUTLINES OR MAKING SUMMARIES CHARACTER OF TEXTBOOK MATERIALTHIS METHOD OF INSTRUCTION IS MADE EVEN MORE WASTEFUL BY THE CHARACTER OF THE MATERIAL IN THE AVERAGE CIVICS TEXTBOOK WHICH CONSISTS FOR THE MOST PART OF HIGHLY28 THE SCHOOL REVIEW JANUARY CONDENSED ABSTRACTIONS AND GENERALIZATIONS FULL OF SIGNIFICANCE TO HIM WHO HAS HAD EXPERIENCE IN THE MATTERS UNDER DISCUSSION IT OFTEN POSSESSES WHEN STANDING ALONE LITTLE MEANING OR INTEREST FOR BOYS AND GIRLS WHAT THE PUPILS NEED IS TO GAIN VICARIOUS EXPERI ENCE THROUGH THE READING OF NUMEROUS DESCRIPTIONS OF SOCIAL LIFE SELECTED TO ILLUSTRATE AND MAKE REAL THE GENERALIZATIONS AND PRIN CIPLES IN THE TEXT THE NEED FOR AN ABUNDANCE OF SUCH DESCRIPTIVE MATERIAL WAS POINTED OUT IN AN ARTICLE WHICH APPEARED IN THE SCHOOL REVIEW THREE YEARS AGO THE FOLLOWING COMMENT WAS MADE WITH REFERENCE TO THE CHARACTER OF EXISTENT TEXTS THESE BOOKS ARE ALL VERY ABSTRACT THEY PACK INTO A PARAGRAPH AN ACCOUNT OF A SOCIAL INSTITUTION WHICH IN ITS PRACTICAL OPERATIONS FILLS THE DAILY LIVES OF THOUSANDS OF MEN AND WOMEN THE ADULT WHO READS ONE OF THESE SUMMARY PARAGRAPHS HAS IN MIND SOME OF THE FACTS OF THE DAILY ROUTINE THROUGH WHICH HE HAS PASSED FOR EXAMPLE THE FULLGROWN MAN WHO READS THAT WOMEN SHOULD NOT BE EMPLOYED FOR LONG HOURS IN A FACTORY KNOWS FROM HIS OWN BACKACHE AND TIRED FEET WHAT LONG HOURS OF LABOR MEAN  THOUGH THE LABORER HAS SOME MEMORY OF LABOR HE HAS DIFFICULTY IN PROJECTING HIS THINKING INTO THE SPHERE OF ACTIVITY OF OTHERS  IF SOCIAL STUDIES ARE ABSTRACT EVEN FOR ADULTS HOW DIFFICULT MUST BE THE EFFORT TO EXPLAIN A SOCIAL INSTITUTION TO A CHILD SUPPOSE ONE TALKS TO A CHILD ABOUT A FAMILY BUDGET FOR A YEAR THERE ARE VERY FEW FAMILIES THAT HAVE THE ABSTRACT FORESIGHT TO LOOK AHEAD A YEAR THE CHILD HAS NO GRASP OF THE MEANING OF A YEAR OF A BUDGET OF THE NEED OF ECONOMY OF THE MEANING OF ORGANIZATION OR OF THE ADVANTAGES OF SYSTEM SOCIAL SCIENCES ARE ABSTRACT FOR ADULTS BUT THEY ARE ABSTRACT BEYOND DEGREE FOR THE CHILD READING MATERIAL IN COMMUNITYLIFE ENGLISHTHE HOPE OF ILLUMINATING THESE ABSTRACTIONS OF UTILIZING THE MUCH NEGLECTED FIELDS OF BIOGRAPHY TRAVEL AND HISTORY OF SUGGESTING A PRACTICAL SUBSTITUTE FOR THE ANALYTICAL METHOD OF STUDYING LITERATURE AND CIVICS AND OF STIMULATING A LOVE OF READING IN BOYS AND GIRLS IS BACK OF THE SELECTION OF THE MATERIAL USED IN THE COMMUNITYLIFE COURSE THE READINGS ARE GROUPED ABOUT THE

PUPILS ARE EXPECTED TO READ SOME OF THE REFERENCES LISTED UNDER EACH OF THE THREE DIVISIONS IN THIS WAY THE TEXT AND THE STUDY REFERENCES ARE SUPPLEMENTED BY THE MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF LIFE AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATION FOUND IN BOOKS ON TRAVEL BIOGRAPHY AND HISTORY WHILE THE TOPIC AS A WHOLE IS VIVIFIED AND ILLUMINATED BY THE PICTURES OF HUMAN RELATIONS AS PORTRAYED BY THE NOVELIST AND THE POET FOR EXAMPLE THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE FAMILY AND ITS SERVICES WHICH HAS BEEN ACQUIRED IN THE STUDY MATERIAL IS BOTH MULTIPLIED AND VITALIZED BY THE CONCRETE DESCRIPTIONS OF HOME LIFE PICTURED IN SUCH BOOKS AS BISHOPS THEODORE ROOSEVELTS LETTERS TO HIS CHILDREN SUCH NOVELS AS KATHLEEN NORRIS MOTHER AND SUCH POEMS AS WHITTIERS SNOWBOUND THE PUPIL WHO HAS STUDIED HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS IN THIS WAY IS LIKELY NOT ONLY TO HAVE A MORE INTELLIGENT AND SYMPATHETIC ATTITUDE TOWARD CIVIC PROBLEMS THAN IF HIS READING HAD BEEN CONFINED TO TEXT MATERIAL BUT ALSO TO APPREHEND MORE CLEARLY THAN WOULD OTHERWISE BE POSSIBLE THE FACT THAT WORTHY LITERATURE ALWAYS IS IN ESSENCE A TRUE REFLECTION OF LIFE READING DONE IN COMMUNITYLIFE COURSESDOES THIS COMBINATION COURSE LEAD TO WIDE READING BY BOYS AND GIRLS  THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION IS TO BE FOUND IN THE DATA SHOWN IN TABLES I AND II IN EXAMINING THESE TABLES IT SHOULD BE REMEMBERED THAT THE READING DONE BY EACH PUPIL REPRESENTS THE WORK OF A SINGLE SEMESTER OF APPROXIMATELY SEVENTEEN WEEKS DURATION IT WILL BE NOTED THAT DURING 192021 THE INSTRUCTOR HAD BUT ONE SECTION EACH SEMESTER WHILE DURING 191920 HE HAD TWO THIS EXPLAINS THE DIFFERENCE IN THE NUMBER OF PUPILS LISTED UNDER THE TWO YEARS TABLE I IS SHOWN GRAPHICALLY IN FIGURE I WHICH REPRESENTS THE DATA IN THE SIX COLUMNS OF THE TABLE A SIGNIFICANT FEATURE OF THESE RECORDS IS THE STEADY INCREASE SHOWN IN THE READING DONE BY SUCCESSIVE CLASSES THE FIRST TWO CLASSES FOR WHICH SUCH FIGURES ARE AVAILABLE THEY ARE NOT HERE SHOWN CONTAINED THIRTYNINE PUPILS ALTHOUGH THESE PUPILS WERE RAPID

INCREASE IN READINGTHE CHIEF CAUSES FOR THE STEADY INCREASE SHOWN SEEM TO HAVE BEEN THREE FIRST A GROWTH IN THE NUM BER OF ATTRACTIVE TITLES ON THE BOOKLISTS SECOND AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF BOOKS IN THE SCHOOL LIBRARY AND THIRD AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE TECHNIQUE OF AROUSING AND SUSTAINING THE PUPILS INTEREST IN READING WHEN THE EXPERIMENT WAS BEGUN NO READING LISTS OF THE KIND DESIRED WERE TO BE FOUND WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE SCHOOL LIBRARIAN MEMBERS OF THE FACULTY INSTRUCTORS IN ENGLISH IN OTHER INSTITUTIONS LIBRARIANS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND THE PUPILS BIBLIOGRAPHIES ON THE VARIOUS TOPICS WERE GRADUALLY CON STRUCTED THE MOST VALUABLE HELP CAME FROM THE PUPILS REFERENCES WHICH DID NOT MEET THEIR APPROVAL WERE ELIMINATED AT THEIR SUG GESTION BY THE METHODS TO BE EXPLAINED LATER TITLES WERE ADDED TO THE LISTS COMPARED WITH THE BIBLIOGRAPHIES AS THEY ARE AT THE PRESENT TIME THE ORIGINAL BOOKLISTS WERE MEAGER AND UNATTRACTIVE AS THEY HAVE GAINED IN VARIETY AND INTEREST

ON A TOPIC OR AT LEAST TO OBTAIN THE PARTICULAR BOOK WHICH HE WANTED AND HAD PERHAPS BEGUN WHILE USE WAS MADE OF EVERY POSSIBLE MEANS OF SUPPLEMENTING THE AVAILABLE MATERIAL THE READING WHICH PUPILS COULD DO WAS NECESSARILY RESTRICTED BY THE LACK OF SUITABLE BOOKS AS THE COURSE DEMONSTRATED ITS VALUE AND36 THE SCHOOL REVIEW ADDITIONAL BOOKS WERE MADE AVAILABLE THE RECORD SHOWS THAT THERE WAS IMMEDIATELY A MARKED INCREASE IN THE READING DONE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CARRY ON A COURSE OF THIS KIND SUCCESSFULLY WITHOUT A GENEROUS SUPPLY OF BOOKS IN SUCH A COURSE AS THE ONE UNDER DISCUSSION BOOKS ARE AS ESSENTIAL AS TESTTUBES AND BUNSEN BURNERS IN A LABORATORY AND SHOULD BE FURNISHED BY SCHOOL AUTHORI TIES IN AS GENEROUS QUANTITIES IF BOOKS ARE NOT FORTHCOMING WITH AS GREAT LIBERALITY AS THE NEED DEMANDS THERE ARE WAYS OF REMEDYING THE SHORTAGE WHICH ARE OPEN IN VARYING DEGREES TO ALL TEACHERS THE PUPILS THEMSELVES USUALLY HAVE SOME OF THE BOOKS ON THE LIST OF READINGS WHICH THEY ARE GLAD TO PUT AT THE SERVICE OF THE CLASS IN ADDITION TO MULTIPLYING THE MATERIAL AT HAND THIS METHOD FURNISHES A PRACTICAL OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CULTIVATION OF GENUINE CITIZENSHIP IN THE SECOND PLACE THE BOOKS AVAILABLE CAN USUALLY BE SUPPLEMENTED AT THE PUBLIC LIBRARY WITH RARE EXCEPTIONS LIBRARIANS ARE EAGER TO COOPERATE WITH TEACH ERS BY PLACING BOOKS ON RESERVE BY ASSISTING IN THE BUILDING UP OF BIBLIOGRAPHIES AND BY LOANING QUANTITIES OF BOOKS TO THE SCHOOLS IN SOME COMMUNITIES THE LIBRARY WILL LOAN BOXES OF BOOKS FOR A MONTH OR MORE AND WILL DELIVER AND CALL FOR THEM WITHOUT EXPENSE TO THE SCHOOL IN ADDITION MANY STATES NOW HAVE LIBRARY BOARDS OR COMMISSIONS FROM WHICH LOANS OF BOOKS CAN BE OBTAINED IN LOTS OF FROM FIFTY TO ONE HUNDRED VOLUMES UPON THE PAYMENT OF FREIGHT CHARGES FINALLY IF NECESSARY IT IS POSSIBLE IN MOST COMMUNITIES TO GIVE AN ENTERTAINMENT THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH CAN BE USED FOR THE PURCHASE OF BOOKS FOR THE SCHOOL LIBRARY THUS BY PURCHASE BY THE COOPERATION OF PUPILS AND BY THE ASSISTANCE OF LIBRARIES AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF BOOKS CAN BE SECURED TO BE CONTINUED

or the application to the general estate of property which does not belong or never has belonged to the bank rupt Gorman v Littlefield 229 U S 19 25 BUILDING RESTRICTIONA DUPLEX OR TWOFAMILY RESIDENCE AS A FIRSTCLASS PRIVATE RESIDENCEThe grantee covenanted that for a certain period no building or structure other than a firstclass private resideuce shall be erected placed or permitted on said premises The grantee erected a duplex building to house two families but it was occupied by one only up to time of trial Held The building as now used and occupied constitutes a strictly firstclass private residence as to outward appearances and the departure from the terms of the covenant as to the interior may be remedied by enjoining its use to one family Walker v Haslet et al Cal 1920 I86 Pac 622 Covenants of restriction of use though not favored will be en forced The intent of the parties as determined from the language of the covenant construed strictly will govern In Levy v Schreyer 177 N Y 293 the covenant against any house except private dwellings was held not violated by an erection of a threestory flat building but its use by more than one family was enjoined as in the principal case However gen erally when the plural is used the covenant is not held violated by a structure housing more than one family See cases cited in 45 L R A NS 729 In the principal case the court took the words of the covenant to describe the use rather than the structure Where the words are private residence or private dwelling there appears to be little conflict of opinion But where the covenant calls for no building other than a dwelling house or a residence building the authorities are not in accord In Schadt v Brill 173 Mich 647 and in Misch v Lehman 178 Mich 225 the restriction that no building other than a dwelling house shall be erected on a lot was held to warrant an in junction against a flat building and a double house with one entrance the court construing the intention to be a single dwelling for one family on each lot and not merely one dwelling house for more than one family Accord see Haris v Roraback I37 Mich 292 Kingston v Busch I76 Mich 566 Bagnall v Young 151 Mich 69 Powers v Radding 225 Mass IIo II MICH L REv 521 In these cases the connoted meaning of the words is included rather than the bare meaning denoted and to this extent they do not follow the rule of strict construction against the covenant which itself is based on the disfavor of covenants of restriction The more recent cases incline to the rule of strict construction See Hamnett v Born 247 Pa 418 Johnson v Jones 244 Pa 386 52 L R A NS 325 Hutchinson v Ulrich 145 Ill 336 Anoff v Williams 94 Ohio St 145 Reformed Church v Building Co 214 N Y 268 L R A I9I5F 65I In a late case in the Supreme Court oi Missouri Bolin v Tyrol Inv Co 273 Mo 257 I917 in which all the above cases were cited the rule of strict construction was adopted contrary to the former holdings in that state in Thompson v Langan 172 Mo App 64 and in Sanders v Dixon 114 Mo App 229 and it was held a covenant excluding the erection of more than one dwelling house of not less than two stories in 545MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW height being in derogation of the fee could not be extended by implication and an apartment building being a dwelling house was not excluded by the covenant CONSTITUTIONAL LAWEQUAL PROTECTION OF THE LAWSREFILLING OF BOTTLES PROTECTED BY TRADEMARKThe defendant was prosecuted under a Florida statute forbidding the refilling of milk bottles etc having a regis tered trade mark blown in The purchaser from the owner of the trade mark was excepted from the operation of the law Held the statute was in valid as contrary to the Florida and Federal constitutions This inhibited refillment was an unjust and unreasonable discrimination in favor of a class of people who own a very common and ordinary kind of personal property Yeager v State Fla I920 83 So 525 There seems to be a decided split in authority on the question of the validity of statutes similar to the one in the principal case Following the decision of People v Cannon I39 N Y 32 the courts of Cal Ky Mass and R I have held such statutes constitutional while upon the reasoning of the leading case of Lippman v People I75 Ill IOI the courts of Ind Mo and Ohio have come to the opposite conclusion Although the authorities are perhaps irreconcilable yet there are certain variations in the wording of the different statutes on which the courts lay great emphasis In two of the statutes declared invalid bottlers of milk cream etc were not included in the operation of the law Lippman v People supra State v Baskowit2 250 Mo 82 In the latter case this exclusion was regarded as sufficient to nega tive the claim that the act was a proper exercise of the police power and to distinguish the statute from that in the Cannon case supra Statutes not re ferring to food products but merely to containers generally have been held invalid as not intended primarily for the protection of the public Horwich v WalkerGordon Lab Co 205 Ill 497 State v Wiggam Ind I918 II8 N E 684 Statutes which have been upheld have uniformly contained an ex press reference to food products Bartolotti v Police Court 35 Cal App 372 Comm v Goldberg 167 Ky 96 Comm v Anselvitch I86 Mass 376 People v Cannon supra People v Luhrs 195 N Y 377 State v Hand Brewing Co 32 R I 56 It was said by the court in the Anselvitch case supra at p 378 that the statute    makes provisions in reference to a kind of prop erty used in a peculiar way which is of such a nature as to call for peculiar provisions for the protection of the public and its owners against the fraud of evildoers Another variation in wording is emphasized in the case of State v Schmuck 77 Ohio St 438 The court in holding invalid a milk bottle statute pointed out that in the New York statute the purchaser from the owner of the trademark was excepted from the penalty of the law while the Ohio act made no such exception and so deprived the purchaser of the right of acquiring property The statute in the principal case FLA GEN STAT 1906 par 3345 being identical with the New York statute in the two particulars above emphasized the decision would hardly seem to be sup ported by the line of authorities cited by the court The contention that such a statute is bad as class legislation was effectively disposed of by the court in 546

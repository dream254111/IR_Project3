interfere with or even ab solutely stop the experimental work of the Bureau of Animal Industry and the three med ical departments of the Governmentthe Army the Navy and the Marine Hospital Service He therefore appeals  to the entire profession of the country to exert themselves to the ut most to defeat this most cruel and inhuman effort to promote human and animal misery and death and to restrict

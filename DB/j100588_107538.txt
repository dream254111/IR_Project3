Esq M A Communicated by J F W Herschel Esq F R S Read June 4 18i6 H E efforts of analysts in determining the fluents of rational functions have been completely successful and their labours form one of the most perfect and beautiful branches of the fluxionary calculus In the irrational functions however we find but little effected With the exception of WARING modern analysts have not added any thing important to the forms given by NEWTON CRAIG COTES and BERNOULLI No attempt lias been made to generalize the known forms and the last eminent writer on the subject LA CRoix seems to consider them as independent results not deducible from any common principles and refers us to the Petersburgh Acts and other miscellaneous Collections In the following pages it is attempted to generalize and systematize our know ledge on this subject and to show that all the known forms result from other forms of the greatest extent not depending on particular functions but upon the properties of all rational functions whatever R R R R denote rational functions of any kind R R X Z n i R R t their inverse functions Thus if x  R v any rational function of v then v  R x the inverse functionMr BROMHEAD on the fuents of It is thought unnecessary to prove that the fluxions of all rational functions and all rational functions of them are themselves rational PROP 1 dx  Rx xRx  can be

such as RR R x where the functions are alternately inverse and direct The cases are very few in which the ditficulty can be overcome and perhaps the following Propositions will be found to include all the instances in which analysts have effected the reduction PROP IV We can rationalize dx DRx Rx RRx  Let R x  v and it becomes dv RIv Rvas in Prop i Cor i We can generally reducefdx  Dp x  x to dv  p

know whether the reduction be applicable the following process may sometimes be useful Let the expression be d  DRx  R R x RRx Then if it be divided by dx DR x  RR x the quo tient will be a rational

remove fractions and make the coefficients of the powers of z vanish This will give the indeterminates if x and v admit common ration alities Thence xe have d  DR   R z rational Should all the artifices in the foregoing propositions fail we must attempt to resolve the fluxion into a series of terms such that each term may be separately rationalized This is 344l4irrationalfu nction s often possible when the original function does not admit a rational expression and can be effected sometimes directly and sometimes by introducing a new variable But it will first be necessary to reduce all irrational functions whatever to a definite form LEMMA To reduce all irrational functions to a definite form 1 By successively multiplying numerators and denomina tors into the same expressions every irrational function may at last be reduced to a series of terms whose numerators and denominators do not contain any fraction or negative index Thus   and if  y a b c are a  jT   acn  bm functions involving fractions or negative indices themselves the reduction is continued in the same manner 2 Now multiply both the numerators and denominators of the expressions so reduced by such multipliers as will render the denominators rational This factor is the product of all the different values of the denominator with the excep tion of the denominator itself The new numerators will still consist of a series of terms not involving any fraction or negative index  If R R R c denote functions of the form cix  c  mml    the irrational takes the form R x Rx a c R x a R   rr   X  T X d  R d   X    I 3 5 4 By reducing the fractional indices of the factors to the 45346 Mr BROMHEAD on the fluents of common denominator n the whole will consist of a series of R x terms 2    xvxq 3 5 By expanding all the integer powers under the index 7 and again reducing the indices of the sums and products which are under it to a common denominator n we shall by continuing the same operations ultimately reduce the whole expression to a series of terms of the form R x AV m S denoting the sum of any number of terms such as follow it wherein R x may be different in each term but always of the form cxm  cxm  e   6 If every value of R x contains a factor axr  bxrI 4  n  n   it may be taken entirely out of the radical and conversely the rational coefficient may be intro duced entirely under the radical 7 Wllen the surd is so reduced that no rational factor can be withdrawn from the radical it is said to be in its lowest terms and is said to be an irrational of the v1 2d or vh order according to the number of the indices    Thus the general expression for a surd of the first order R x is a series of terms R V cxC  Cxm    8 A more convenient general form for all irrationals thanirrational functions the series of terms above exhibited may readily be found by introducing all the rational parts entirely under the radi cals by reducing the indices of all the terms to a common denominator p by expanding all integer powers and by again reducing all the products and sums contained under  to indices with a common denominator yt These operations continued will ultimately lead to the expression y F  P  b R x S S vS V  where a may be of any diffe R x R x rent values in the different sums but always of the form ax  ax   I bx  bx I R x 9 RX is said to be of aM dimensions and if a  be dimensions of that rational part whose dimensions are great est then the dimensions of the whole irrational are e Io The fluxion and its dimensions in any irrational may be found by applying this formula d     x  D q q

always be found and the other terms may often be rationalized by distinct substi tutions when we are unsuccessful withfdx  p x Again since in each of the terms x  R x R x I 3 a  R n may be reduced to a series of terms of the form Aax and  j therefore the fluent depends X  a on a series of terms fdx  x  x and dx xa x InI the latter case the form of p x is not changed by sub stituting x for x  a and  the fluents of all irrationals are determinable byJdx  x  p x Cor i If we multiply the denominator of dz  R x R x Vax d  d R  v iX2  X v by its rationalizing factor the fluxion will be reduced to two terms which admit distinct rationalities Cor 2 Sometimes by the substitution of a new variable for some function of x the fluxion will be divided into a series of terms each of which may be separately made rational But unfortunately no general principle has been discovered to which these reductions can be referred Cor 3 As the fluent of each term can sometimes be foundirrationalfunctio0ns apart when the fluent of the whole cannot be found at once so conversely the fluent of a series of terms may be found when each separate term surpasses the powers of analysis Thus weknow d q x  d x 4 o px  x  o e But we do not know d 9 x r dp x x   p    Again let p x be such a function of x that 2 x  7 let p x x   Thenfdx  c x  x  cp x fd x  x  x q x fd q x   cp x  x  ed x f P   dx  x  e fdx  x   Which theorem admits farther extension and may be applied to elliptic arches Should the above processes for rendering the fluxion rational fail us we must attempt the fluxion at once in its irra tional state for which purpose I shall add a few miscellaneous observations i If p x V x be any algebraic functions d x then dT x  log m x  dp x  i is an alge braic expression Whenever therefore we meet with an 349Mr BROMHEAD on the fluents of algebraic fluxion we may legitimately try q x  log p x as a form to which the fluent may possibly belong 9 It presents three cases ist where the fluent is wholly algebraic for which we assume some expression so general that its fluxion will include the given fluxion if it admit an algebraic fluent or we find the fluent implicitly by an equa tion ddly where the fluent is mixed when we attempt to separate the algebraic part 3dly where the fluent is purely logarithmic when we assume as in the firat case some ex pression with indeterminate constants sufficiently general to include the given fluxion g In assuming for an algebraic fluxion it must be observed that the fluent will always be a surd of the same order as the fluxion On this principle WARING gives some assumptions for surds of the second order but nothing has been attempted generally for surds of all orders for want of some definite form which should include them all In irrationals of the first order the fluxion may always be reduced to series of terms such as dx  Ix  a x  aY ix  a where the factors are all different and where the indices are positive negative fractions integers or unity Then let R x be any expression cx  cxnZ    with inde terminate coefficients Assume for the fluent    x  n R x nI  It is obvious that the fluent of an algebraic fluxion cannot be of the form dp x  T   x  log p x for its fluxion df X  d x log log x  x is a transcendent 350irrationaljunctionns Its fluxion will be DR x x  a  a x a    I R X R a a x   a  3  ix a  a ni SI S I multiplied by dx  xv  a  x a the original fluxion I n Now that the two expressions may be equal the coefficient found above must be  i or we must have DR xQR  Q R x nI nI ni where Q and Q are the expressions in the coefficient involv ing a a a By equating the terms in this equation the inde i n terminates c c c c may be found but the reduction will I 2 often be impossible as there are more equations to be satis fied than there are indeterminates 4 If any index a 3y  the expression fails and there is no algebraic fluent also WARING says that if the dimen sions of a fluxional coefficient be i  the fluent cannot be algebraic 5 If x be an irrational function let z fdx q x fdJx v then since R x v  o there are cases where we can determine R x z  o 6 If x r x be irrational functions of  we have Jdf  x fd  x  s x fJ   Now let I x be so assumed that  See Phil Trans 1764EMBRsoNR Fluxions 351fVMr BROMHEAD o0 thefluents of fdx  x   x I   and we have dx  q x3 p xfod  r x  If therefore r x be a simpler expression than x the fluxion will be reduced to a simpler form In order to find w x x is assumed with indeterminate coefficients so that its fluxion may be of the same form as dx  q x Now equate the similar terms in the two expressions and the inde terminates may be found But as there may be more equa tions than indeterminates we add vr x a function of the same form and containing indeterminates of sufficient num ber to satisfy all the deficient equations We shall thus have D p   P X  x  and  x d  x  x by which the difficulty may be reduced to findingfdx  r x Reductions of particular kinds were discovered by SIMPSON and others but this is universally applicable 7 It may be of advantage to reduce the index of the vari able under the radical which may sometimes be effected In dx  e mr   1  assume xmn  1  vn Then we have dx  xm   mr  dv    v  m n And in the same manner surds of one order may be trans formed into another 8 If the fluent be wholly logarithmic we may assume for irrationals of the first order iog  R x  a6 x  b  R   c   O  iirrational fnctios 9 I shall conclude by observing that the fluxion may al ways be made rational if the fluent be wholly algebratc or wholly logarithmic Thus if q x be any algebraic function take xa p 1 R v Then dq x  d q R v d R v and d log px  d log qpl R v i are both rational If the fluent be of the mixed form  x  log x its fluxion may be made rational if R 1R can be so assumed that I R x  p1 R x and it may i i always be effected by introducing two new variables First let x  x R v and the fluxion becomes d99R v dR v  R now let v R pC R Z an Rq Rv Sl i  we get d R d R z a v  R  which is wholly rational I EDWARD FFRENCH BROMHEAD NoteAs modern analysts have in general confounded the fluxions either with the increments or the derived functions it may not be superfluous to state precisely what is meant by the symbols d and D If it be possible which must be shown in each particular case to expand p x  v in the form p x  9 x  q x   then 9 x is called the derived    function of i x and its relation to Q x is thus expressed p x  D x Hence if x be considered a function of itself we have x  v  x  D x  v and  D x Now to avoid a constant reference to the variable x of which other variables are considered as functions we introduce fluxions Ify  w  are functions of the 355354 Mr R BROMHEAD on thefluents of irrationalfunctions same variable then dy dz dw  are expressions proportional to the derived func tions of y zs w  whatever may be the variable of which they are common func tions Iene e Wy Dz and if y be a function of x or   then d  Dop x De  Dp x and  dy  dx  Dp x Moreover since the derived functions are in the limiting ratio of the increments so also are the fluxions From this consideration we can in the applications of analysis practically determine the ratio of the fluxions when the derived functions are unknown ERRATA Page 72 line zo for parts read part  73 line 3 for between read below 98 line 4

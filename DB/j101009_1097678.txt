And his frequent quotations from and reference to the Bible showed as well how earnestly he had studied its teachings as the life he led showed how well he applied them The writer knows in Whom he trusted and he knows with what simple faith he put his hand in that of Him who can alone sustain when the shadows gather around us For three or four years prior to his death his letters show not only that he was deeply sensible of the nearness of his end but with what calm confidence he was trusting in Him who would keep that he had committed unto him against that day In a letter to the writer not very long before his death he concludes by saying I hope I shall see you before long    This prospect however is by no means assured At the farthest the end is near and I realize it With this in view

State Bar Association Before I enter on the discussion of my theme permit me to express my keen gratification at finding myself in this congenial company I am a lawyer and a Virginian I feel here the sort of exhilaration that must always come to a man who returns from a distance to breathe his native air again and mix once more with those to whom he feels bound by a sort of intellectual consanguinity I am proud of Vir ginias traditions as you are I feel as you do that she gave the An address delivered by Prof Woodrow Wilson of Princeton University before the Virginia State Bar Association held at the Hot Springs of Virginia August 3 4 and 51897 1897 337VIRGINfA LAW REGISTER country its first life long kept a sort of presidency in its affairs and has always been one of the strategic centres of its society and its poli tics I feel as if her great University where like so many of you I was trained in the law were still in no small part my academic homeand I know that here among men of my own race and breed ing I can speak my mind frankly upon any theme as the best men have always spoken in Virginia ever since Sir George Yeardley sum moned that first Assembly in the little church at Jamestown in the far year 1619 It heartens a man not a little to know that he may speak his real thought and be understood if he but speak it in the right temper It is my purpose today to speak of public affairs and we have a longer tradition than that of Virginia even to give us warrant for free speech in that field We have the immnemorial practice of the English race itself to which we belong Nowhere else has the pure strain of the nation which planted the Colonies and made the independent govern ment under which we live bee kept so without taint or mixture as it has been in Virginia and hitherto in all the South One feels here that the origin and breeding the impulse and the memory of the nien he deals with are unmistakable that he reckons with an ascertained force and a certain habita force and a habit that have not changed since the great days of the Revolution when Virginia led the country in the making of the Constitutionand that he ought to be able to count now among the offspring of that achieving generation upon the same fearless examination of policies and institutions that enabled Washington and Mason and Henry and Madison to ivin triumphs in their heroic day This is not a day of revolution but it is a day of change and of such change as may breed revolution should we fail to guide and mod erate it Institutions if they live must grow and suffer the altera tions of growthmust rise to new uses must lose some parts and take others on They cannot stand still they cannot even stiffen to a single shape and use The nation must at every turn make its choice not only as to legislative policy but also as to the uses to which it shall put its fundamental law and its very principles of government If ever a nation was transformed this nation has been under the eyes of a single generationand processes that run so fast are perilous The choices made in the midst of them are not deliberate but hasty and almost at hazard the necessary adjustments of life and institutions are made not by plan but upon the suggestion of the instant It is 338 Sept LEADERLESS GOVERNMENT matter surely of common prudence that we should pause and look the time through when we can with a purpose to gain distinct knowl edge of what is going forward discover its force and direction and make ourselves ready to assume control of it for the future seeing that the pace is now set the running determined It is time we should speak frankly with each other about the present and about the future I mean to go if I can today to the centre of some ofthe chief topics of government We chose the forms of political life under which we live and it is our duty to scrutinize them from season to season if we would keep them incorrupt and suitable to our use We talk of statesmanship and of policy sometimes as if they arose out of institutions but we know that they do not They are the children of individual initiative and of individual strength of character The framers of our Constitutions in this country made a great deal of in stitutions but after all institutions only create the conditions under which action must be planned they do not breed action No govern ment will run itself The excellence of any form of government de pends upon the provision it has made for the action of those who con duct it and choose its policies It gets its character from what they find it possible to do The men who chose our present forms of gov ernment made much of law and of method because they were engaged in a work of actual creation They were constructing a policy which was novel and without model and they knew that definiteness of plan was for the time being everything They were forging and fitting and bolting the structural iron of the whole fabric of which they were the originating architects But we are now choosing policies not forms of government The nation is made its mode of action is deter mined what we now want to know is What is it going to do with its life its material resources and its spiritual strength  How is it to gain and keep a common purpose in the midst of complex affairs How is its government to afford it wisdom in action This is the question I have chosen to discuss Put in its most direct form it is this How is the nation to get definite leadership and form steady and effective parties Take what government you will this question includes all others if you inquire concerning effidiency Among a free people there can be no other method of government than such as permits an undictated choice of leaders and a strong unhampered making up of bodies of active men to give them effective support When party government fails all definiteness goes out of politics Who is to be held responsible for policy By what leger 339 1897340 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Sept demain are you to get anything done Shall you convince one man at a time the nation through assume that your neighbor counts for as much in affairs as any one else hazard the fortunes of the nation upon a chance concurrence of opinion Policywhere there is no abso lute and arbitrary ruler to do the choosing for a whole peoplemeans massed opinion and the forming of the mass is the whole art and mastery of politics How is the massing done among us Who chooses our leaders and by what process What guides our parties and what do we know them to stand for  These are questions of fact to be answered first without attention to the criticisms our answers may suggest with regard to some of the radical features of our con stitutional arrangements Let those criticisms follow after if they must We cannot afford to blink either the facts or their necessary revelations I have told you my own conclusion with regard to our present con stitutional usage in the title I have chosen for this address By the words  Leaderless Government I mean to describe the Government of the United States I do not utter the words with the least touch of censoriousness or cynicism or even discouragement In using them I am simply speaking a careful and if I may so say a dispassionate judgment I do not believe it a necessary feature of our government that we should be without leaders neither do I believe that we shall continue to be without them but as a matter of fact we are without them and we ought to ask ourselves Why  I mean of course that we are without official leaderswithout leaders who can be held im mediately responsible for the action and policy of the government alike upon its legislative and upon its administrative side Leaders of some sort we of course always have but they come and go like phantoms put forward as if by accident withdrawn not by our choice but as if upon some secret turn of fortune which we neither anticipate nor as a nation controlsome local quarrel some obscure movement of politics within a single district some manipulation of a primary or some miscarriage in a convention They are not of the nation but come and go as if unbidden by any general voice The government does not put them forward but groups of men formed we hardly know where planning we hardly know what the government suffers no change when they disappearthat is the private affair of some single constituency and of the men who have supported them Look at the familiar system for a little with this matter in view and you shall see that as we now use it it seems devised as if to pre1897 LEADERLESS GOVERNMENT 341 vent official and responsible leadership The President cannot lead We call his office great say that the Queen of England has no power to be compared with his and make choice of nominees for the Presi dency as if our votes decided a constructive policy for the four years to come but we know that in fact he has as little power to originate as the Queen has He may no doubt stand in the way of measures with a veto very hard to overleap and we think oftentimes with deep comfort of the laws he can kill when we are afraid of the majority in Congress Congressional majorities are doubtless swayed too by what they know the President will do with the bills they send him But they are swayed sometimes one way and sometimes another ac cording to the temper of times and the state of parties They as often make his assured veto a pretext for recklessness as a reason for self restraint They take a sort of irresponsible and defiant pleasure in giving him the dare in proposing things they know many people want and put upon him the lonely responsibility of saying they shall not have them And if he stand for long in the way of any serious party purpose they heat opinion against him and make his position more and more unpleasant until he either yields or is finally dis credited It is a game in which he has no means of attack and few effective weapons of defense Of course he can send a message to Congress whenever he likes the Constitution bids him do so from time to time in order to  give the Congress information of the state of the Union and recom mend to their consideration such measures as he shall deem necessary and expedient and we know that if he be a man of real power and statesmanlike initiative he may often hit the wish and purpose of the action so in the quick in what he urges upon Congress that the Houses will heed him promptly and seriously enough But there is a stub born and very natural pride in the Houses with respect to this matter They not he are the nations representatives in the making of laws and they would deem themselves subservient were they too often to permit him leadership in legislative policy It is easy to stir their re sentment by too much suggestion and it is best that a message should be general not special best that it should cover a good many topics and not confine itself too narrowly to one if a President would keep in credit with those who shape matters within the House and Senate In all ordinary times the President recognizes this and preserves a sort of modesty a tone as if of a chronicler merely and setter forth of things administrative when he addresses Congress He makes it his342 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Sept study to use only a private influence and never to seem a maker of resolutions And even when the occasion is extraordinary and his own mind definitely made up he argues and urges he cannot com mand In short in making suggestions to Congress the President of the United States has only this advantage over any other influential person in the nation who might choose to send to Congress a letter of information and advice it is the duty of Congress to read what he says all the larger newspapers will print it most of them will have editorial comments upon it and some will have letters from their Washington correspondents devoted to guessing what effect if any it will have upon legislation The President can make his message a means of concentrating public opinion upon particular topics of his own choosing and so force those topics upon the attention of the Houses But that is all and under ordinary circumstances it is not much It was not so in the early years of the government Roughly speaking Presidents were leaders until Andrew Jackson went home to the  Hermitage  Sometimes they have been leaders since but in the old days it was a matter of course that they should be Since Jackson rmasterful figure passed off the stage the ordinary courses of politics have been drawing us away from the state of things which once made the country and politicians themselves instinctively turn to the President for guidance as if he were a sort of prime minister as well as the official head of the permanent administration Wash ington led of course and fashioned the government itselffor rea sons no man any longer needs to have stated to him and his first cabinet as everybody knows was made up of the party masters of the daymen whom all knew to be chief political figures not for the moment only but also fdr the years to come John Adams the second President was almost as great a figure in all civil affairs as Washington himself Jefferson was a born leader of men who not only led his party but first created it and then taught it the methods of power Madison felt in no small measure that compulsion by which later Presidents by the half dozen have been led and mastered the compulsion of Congressional initiativeresident in that day of change in the person of Henry Clay and John C Calhoun under whom themselves youngsters in the arena a young party was coming to selfconsciousness and authority But Madison was of a stature and eminence in affairs which even the high and taking qualities of these men could not dwarf Monroe saw times of quiet peace whenLEADERLESS GOVERNMENT parties seemed for a little to have fallen asleep John Quincy Adams but kept the seat warm for Jacksonand not very warm at that and with Jackson came in a new democracy which was to change the whole face of affairs Merely to name these men is to call the roll of Iwo generations It was taken for granted at the first that the real leaders of the nation would be put into the Presidential chair For a little while Vicel Presidents succeeded Presidents as if of course and then for a season Presidents were allowed to name their own successors in their appoint ments to the office of Secretary of Stateor rather were expected to fill that great office with men whom their party accepted as second only to Presidents themselves in weight and influence their natural successors The management of these things was left in that day to wellknown groups of men which all the country knew to constitute each for its own party a sort of unofficial ministry Nominations were arranged in Congressional caucus by men in whose hands rested not only the conduct of these matters but the whole shaping of party policies as well and they naturally chose according to some recog nized plan compatible with the immediate objects of their organiza tion putting those in authority who were their actual leaders and to whom they looked for guidance whether in office or out It was no doubt inevitable that this system of congressional nomina tion should come to an end The nation began before very long to look upon it as a system which bred intrigue and threatened to put affairs of the first importance into the hands of cliques and rings But in rejecting that system to pass to the use of nominating conven tions we certainly rendered it impossibleor at any rate in the highest degree unlikelythat our presidents should ever be leaders again Do what you will in such a matter you do not very much lessen the overwhelming weight of Congress You still have the real energy of the government with the men who make the laws pay the bills and create the conditions under which the Presidents must act Roger Sherman declared very bluntly in the ConstitutionalCon4en tion of 1787 that  he considered the executive magistracy as nothing more than an institution for carrying the will of the legislature into effect and although we may not be willing to go the length of say ing quite so much as that we see even more clearly now than Roger Sherman did at the beginning that in the last resort it lies with Con gress and not with the executive to choose what the government shall be and do And we know that it is a serious matter that the intimate 1897344 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Sept relations which once existed between Congress and the President should have been so completely broken The men who are sent to our nominating conventions are men for the most part little knownand in other matters little regarded men who have nothing to do with legislation and who are without any responsible part whatever in the choice of policies for the nation An incalculable number of local influences utterly obscure to the country at large and unconnected as we know with any general party pur pose or policy of which the country can know anything determine the instructions with which delegates are sent They run together to press the claims of a score of candidates selected not by the general voice of any party but upon grounds of preference which only their special friends and partisans can explain Generally it turns out that the candidates whom all the country knows have been too much talked about beforehand too definitely preferred or rejected in the prelimi nary contests in which the delegates were chosen Some  dark horse some man hitherto little thought of some one whom his friends have astutely known how to push in the secret conferences of separate dele gations some nman whose personal tact or force has caught of a sudden the enthusiasm of the convention itself and of the crowds in the gal leries some man unheralded and untried it may be catches the drift of the vote and is nominated A good man he may be and a fair PresidentProvidence has been kind to us much beyond the encour agement we have given it but he is not always a man whomi we know and he is seldom a man accepted in Washingcon as of course a leader andmaker of affairs Singular things happen in the process A new figure emerges sometimes behind the accepted candidate the figure of his backer and manager Nobody has known him until now outside his State Men hear his name with curiosity But if his candidate be elected they hear it for a little while with aweand behold a new Colossus in the midst of our shifting politics Seasoned congressmen smile in their beards no doubt to see the new man come radiant to Washington beaming authority on every side but they court him for a brief space as one who has the ear of the President in the making of appoint ments and thenwhen the appointments are made and the President has found his placethey draw aside to see whether this crack coach will slip into oblivion or not And so each man has his entry and his exit And even if things go differently even when the man whom theLEADERLESS GOVERNMENT convention nominates is some one whose career and influence we know or can assess how often does it happen that he is such a man as will be accepted as a real leader at Washingtonwhere alone he can lead Nobody supposes I take it that Mr McKinley was ever the real leader of the Republican party He did not even play a really con structive part in the framing of the celebrated tariff law which we call by his name but the country thought he did and rejected what they deemed his handiwork in the most emphatic manner by name and title Whatever personal admiration Mr McKinley may have excited by reason of the sincerity simplicity and directness of his character he was clearly dwarfed in all matters of party choice by Mr Reed and Mr Lodge and the real leaders of the Republican ranks It was much the same as if Mr Depew had been taken in his stead a promi nent person but no master of policy except that congressmen particu larly resent the selection of an outsider Mr McKinley had at least been bred to politics in the atmosphere of Washington and might be expected to know something of the temper and tact of dealings be tween the President and the Houses Plainly the nominating conven tion has separated legislature and executive much more sharply than the makers of the Constitution intended has brought utterly incalcu lable forces into play for the choice of our Presidents and has cut us off once and for all from the old traditions of party leadership We must take our Presidents at somewhat haphazard and by a special clumsy machinery out of the general body of the nation and the Houses must provide themselves with purposes and leaders of their own And yet the Houses show a notable lack of efficient organization for I take it for granted that when one is speaking of a representative legislature he must mean by  an efficient organization an organiza tion which provides for deliberate and deliberative action and which enables the nation to affix responsibility for what is done and for what is not done The Senate is deliberative enough but it is hardly de liberative after its ancient and better manner and who shall say who is responsible for what it does and for what it does not do The House of Representatives is neither deliberate nor deliberative We have not forgotten that one of the most energetic of its recent Speakers thanked God in his frankness that the House was not a deliberative body It has not time for the leadership of argument it has not time therefore to disclose the individual weight of its members Debate takes time It also lets the nation hear the prevailing voices and the 1897 345VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER reasons for action For debate and leadership in that sort the House must have a party organization and discipline such as it never has had The Speaker of our House is its masterhow absolutely members of the House have known these two generations and more but the general public have only recently begun to find out It has time out of mind been the custom amongst us to elevate the leader of the dominant party in the popular House to its Speakershipever since colonial times when the Speaker of the Assembly was our spokesman against the domineering governor and council whom the Crown had appointed We have long been familiar with the idea that for some reason which we have not very carefully looked into the presiding officer of our representative chamber is not a mere moderator but also a guiding spirit in legislation and so we have not very carefully noted the several steps by which he has come to be a sort of dictator In the first place the House sifts and handles all its business by means of standing committees Thousand of bills are presented for consider ation every session it would be impossible to consider them all or even to vote upon them all were the House to give itself up exclu sively to voting They naturally fall into classes according to their subjects and for each class there is a standing committee to which they are referred But it is a critical matter for a bill that it should pass into the hands of a committee along with hundreds of other bills relating to the same or like matters It may be it will not come back alive The committee is very likely to pocket most of the proposals sent it and to modify the restand the net result is that all legisla tion in effect originates with the committees or at any rate comes before the House unmistakably marked by their handling And the Speaker appoints the committees Of course he has not a perfectly free hand in the matter Length and priority of service entitle certain members to certain chief posts of honor on the commit tee lists and the Speaker besides regarding their claims must take counsel in some decent degree with the other leaders of his party be fore he finally makes up his mind whom he shall put upon the com mittees but he none the less determines their makeup and their makeup determines legislation That is the Speakers power of cre ation and that is the reason the session disappoints the country and discredits the party if the Speaker be not a consummate party leader But that is only a part of the Speakers power He also retains control of the business of the House from day to day in a very auto cratic manner The rules of the House themselves in part determine 346 SeptLEADERLESS GOVERNMENT what the course of business shall be They give precedence to the reports of the committees which have charge of bills touching the rais ing and the spending of revenue and they determine in what order and at what times the other committees shall be allowed to report When important matters pile up and it becomes necessary to fix a special order by which questions of the first consequence shall gain precedence and the docket be relieved of its congestion the Committee on Rules is authorized to bring in a temporary programme for the purpose But the Speaker appoints the Committee on Rules and is himself its chairman He steers as well as presides The rules are adopted afresh at the opening of every new Congress with such modifications as the Committee may have to suggestand that committee is always the first to be appointed Its regulations alike in ordinary and extraordinary cases aim always at this single and consistent object to keep business in the hands of the committees and rigidly exclude personal initiative on the part of individual mem bers It requires unanimous consent for a member to get any matter before the House independently of the committees and you cannot even ask for unanimous consent unless you can obtain recognition and get the floor The Speakers eye is his own He can see whom he pleases and he must know your object before he will recognize you If he do not know it he will not see you He will never see you even when he does know it if he knows it to be something that will upset or interfere with party plans or the settled programme of the session if only by taking up time You may remonstrate with him and pray to him in private as you will he will not let you cross the purposes he has in view as the leader of his party Or if by reason of your im portunity he should at last seem to yield and agree to accord you recognition and a chance to make your motion you may be sure he will take very good care to get some members promise that he will promptly object and you will fail of unanimous consent and be silenced after all Here then is your silent master of men and of policies in the House the Speaker who appoints the committees which originate legislation determines the order of business at every critical point through the Committee on Rules and sees whom he will amongst those who would put themselves forward in the business of the House I have not described him to condemn him I do not see how else business could go xorward in an assembly which would otherwise be a mere massmeeting But I do wish to make it evident that this is an 347 1897VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER extraordinary picture and that it sets our national legislature apart as unique among the representative assemblies of the worldunique in having its leader silent and in the form of his office a mere moderator and in having its course of action determined by management and not by debate And what of leadership in the Senate When you have described the House of Representatives you have described but half of Congress and that senators would say the lower half The Senate unquestion ably whatever we may say of the House of Representatives stands unique among legislative bodies in the modern time Whether we relish its uniqueness in the present generation quite as much as it was relished among our fathers is an open question but its individuality is indubitable This singular body has assumed of late what I may perhaps be allowed to call a sort of RomoPolish character Like the Roman Senate it has magnified its administrative powers and its right of negative in the great fields of finance and foreign affairs as well as in all ordinary legislation and following Polish precedents it has seemed to arrogate to its members the right of individual veto Each senator like each prince of ancient Poland insists it would seem upon consulting his own interests and preferences before he will allow measures to reach their final consideration and passage In the field of administration it seems plain the Senate expects the executive very generally to submit to its oversight and suggestion as Roman magistrates submitted to the Senate of their singular republic I am anxious not to distort the true proportions of the picture even in pleasantry and if to put the matter as I havy just put it savors too much of exaggerating temporary tendencies into established prac tices let us rest content with saying merely that this noted assembly has at almost every critical juncture of our recent political history had an influence in affairs greater much greater than that of the House of Representatives and that the methods by which this great council is led are likely to be of the utmost consequence to the nation at every turn in its fortunes Who leads the Senate  Can anyone say  It too has its standing committees to which all of its business is in the first place sent as to the committees of the House but it accords them no such mastery as is accorded the committees of the House Debate and amendment make free with committee reports as with any other matter and upon the open floor of the Senate no man is master The VicePresident is an outsider not the leader of his partyeven if his party have the majority in the Senateand 348 SeptLEADERLESS GOVERNMENT generally not a very influential outsider timid about asserting even the natural powers of a parliamentary moderator Among the senators themselves there is an equality as absolute as the equality of the sover eign states which they represent It is give and take amongst them Personal conferences are the only means for the adjustment of views and the compounding of differences One senator is as formidable as a dozen in the obstruction of business The Senate as a whole is jealous of its dignity and of its prerogatives and its members severally stand out distinct units in every matter of controversy Who shall say who leads and who obeys amongst them And so we have the composite thing which we call the Government of the United States Its several parts are severally chosen it is no unified and corporate whole Its President is chosen not by proof of leadership among the men whose confidence he must have if he is to play an effective part in the making of affairs but by management the management of obscure men and through the uncertain chances of an ephemeral convention which has no other part in politics Its popular chamber shapes its affairs not by conference with those who must execute the laws and show them feasible nor yet by any classifying process of debate but chiefly by means of the silent management of its moderator whose office is fixed for a two years term and who rep resents not the country but a single constituency Its Senate is a band of individuals amongst whom it is impossible to maintain leadership and to whom it is difficult to extend the dicipline of party organization This is not a government of systematic checks and balances a system of checks and balances would enable you to distinguish causes and calculate effects It is a government without definite order showing a confused interplay of forces in which no man stands at the helm to steer whose course is beaten out by the shifting winds of personal influence and popular opinion On the whole however it has not worked ill you will say and what was good enough for our fathers is good enough for us I heartily assent to the one proposition but not to the other A colonial govern ment was once good enough for our fathers if you will but go back so far but it was not good enough for their sons and our government as we use it is not as good as when they used it Our fathers were choos ing men and so must we be They chose governments to suit their circumstances not to suit their ancestors and we must follow the like good rulepraying that we may choose wisely as they did The colonial governments were not failures so long as they were good 1897 349350 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Sept enough to last and certainly the government of the United States has been no failure but a success so conspicuous for the most part that the nations of the world have stood at gaze to see so great a thing done in the West upon the new continent whither they supposed none but radicals had gone You shall not find me uttering aught in dispraise of the great work of that memorable body of statesmen who met in Philadelphia in that year 1787 which they have made illustrious They have won an imperishable name in the history of politics and no man can take away from them were he churl enough to wish to do so Neither shall you find me an advocate of radical changes The men who made our government showed themselves statesmen in nothing so much as in this that they adapted what they had to a new age and we shall not be wise if we outrun their great example But let us know the facts and if need be fit our institutions to suit them There is cowardice sometimes in mere selfsatisfaction The government of the United States as we use it besides is not the government of the United States as they used it Why is it that this leaderless character of our government did not disclose itself to an earlier generation as it has disclosed itself to us The government has the same formal structure now that it always has had why has its weakness been so long concealed  Why can it not serve the new time as well as it served the old  Because the new time is not like the oldfor us or any other nationthe changes which we have witnessed have transformed us But tasks set the government now differ both in magnitude and in kind from those set in days gone by It is no old mans fancy that the old days were different from those we now see For one thingand this can be no news to any manan industrial revolution separates us from the times that went by no longer ago than when the war between the States carne on and that industrial revolu tion like the war itself has not affected all parts of the country alike has left us more various and more unequal part by part than ever before WVe speak nowadays of a new sectionalism and I for one deprecate the phrase I rejoice to believe that there are no longer any permanent sectional lines in this country But there is an un precedented diversification of interests and for the time no doubt differences of interests mark also differences of region and development And these differences of condition and of economic growth as between region and region though temporary are more sharply marked than they ever were before Moreover there is a confused variety region differs from region in an almost incalculable number of significantLEADERLESS GOVERNMENT details And there is added to this everywhere a swift process of change a shifting of elements a perplexing vicissitude in affairs Here and there communities have a fixed life and are still and quiet as of old but these lie apart from the great forces that are making the nation and the law is change These things do not need demonstration they hardly need illustra tion No man is so illinformed as not to know that the conditions which existed before the war were simple and uniform the country through as compared with those which have sprung up since the war And where conditions are comparatively simple and uniform construc tive leadership is little needed Men readily see things alike and easily come to a common opinion upon the larger sort of questions or at any rate to two general opinions widespread and definite enough to form parties on For wellnigh a generation after the war more over the problems which the government of the Union had to settle were very definite problems indeed which no man could mistake and upon which opinion could readily be concentrated I think the country sadly needed responsible and conscientious leadership during the period of Reconstruction and it has suffered many things because it did not get itthings of which we still keenly feel the consequences But the tasks at least were definite and unmistakable and parties formed themselves upon sharpcut issues Since then how has the scene changed It is not now fundamental matters of structure and franchise upon which we have to center our choice but those general questions of policy upon which every nation has to exercise its discretion foreign policy our duty to our neighbors customs tariffs coinage currency immigration the law of corporations and of trusts the regulation of railway traffic and of the great indus tries which supply the necessaries of life and the stuffs of manufacture These are questions of economic policy chiefly and how shall we settle questions of economic policy except upon grounds of interest Who is to reconcile our interests and extract what is national and liberal out of what is sectional and selfish These are not questions upon which it is easy to concentrate general opinion It is infinitely diffi cult to effect a general enlightenment of the public mind in regard to their real merits and significance for the nation as a xvhole Their settlement in any one way affects the several parts of the country un equally They cannot be settled justly by a mere compounding of differences a mere unguided interplay of rival individual forces with out leadership and the courage of definite party action Such ques 1897 351352 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Sept tions are as complex and as difficult of adequate comprehension as the now infinitely varied life of the nation itself and we run incalculable risks in leaving their settlement to the action of a House of Repre sentatives whose leaders are silent and do not tell us upon what prin ciple they act or upon what motive to a Senate whose undiciplined members insist upon making each an individual contribution to the result and to a President chosen by processes which have little or nothing to do with party organization or with the solution of questions of state We can seldom in this way see a single year ahead of us I for my part when I vote at a critical election should like to be able to vote for a definite line of policy with regard to the great ques tions of the daynot for platforms which Heaven knows mean little enoughbut for men known and tried in the public service with records open to be scrutinized with reference to these very matters and pledged to do this or that particular thing to take this or that definite course of action As it is I vote for nobody I can depend upon to do anythingno not if I were to vote for myself It may be that if I vote with the successful party my representative in the House is a perfectly honest wellmeaning and moreover able man but how do I know upon which committee Mr Speaker will put him How do I know where his influence will come in in the silent play of influences it may be perfectly legitimate influences that runs through the committee rooms in so heady a stream How do I know what the Speaker and those with whom he takes counsel will let the House do  I do not vote for the senators of my State I do not always know just why those who do choose them make the particular selections they hit upon When I vote for presidential electors I know only what the candidates friends say he will do He accepts a platform made for him by a convention which he did not lead and which does not have to carry out its own programme and I know that he may have no constructive power at all when he gets to Washington No man can vote with real hope or confidence or with intelligent interest even under such a system What would I have I feel the embarrasment of the question If I answer it I make the unpleasant impression of posing as a statesman and tempt those who wish to keep every man in his place to remind me that I am only a college professor whom it would better become to stick to his legitimate business of describing things as they are leaving it to men of affairs to determine what they ought to be I have been trying to describe things as they are and that has brought me whetherLEADERLESS GOVERNMENT I would or no straight upon this question of the future I am not addressing a college class but men of affairs who want their doctrine in the concrete and with no shirking of hard questions Moreover the things I have been describing are the proper objects of my study In lecturing upon politics I try indeed not to lecture as a politician but I try also not to lecture as a fossil I must study affairs of the day as well as things dead and buried and all but forgot I remember too that this is not a convention but a body of students You will want from me not a programme of reform but a suggestion for thought My studies have taught me this one thing with a definiteness which cannot be mistaken successful governments have never been conducted safely in the midst of complex and critical affairs except when guided by those who were responsible for carrying out and bringing to an issue the measures they proposed and the separation of the right to plan from the duty to execute has always led to blundering and inef ficiency and modern representative bodies cannot of themselves com bine the two The Roman Senate the only efficient administrative assembly that I know of in the history of the world was a permanent body made up for the most part of men who had served their terms as executive officials through a long succession of offices It undertook actually to direct the affairs of the state as our Houses do but its members had had varied executive experience and what was of still more significance its mistakes came back upon itself The shame of failure fell upon it and not upon those who were merely its agents Moreover it was a thoroughly national power it stood for no constitu encies in its days of success it represented not a divided but a thoroughly homogeneous state If you would have the present error of our system in a word it is this that Congress is the motive power in the government and yet has in it nowhere any representative of the nation as a whole Our executive on the other hand is national at any rate may be made so and yet has no longer any place of guidance in our system It represents no constituency but the whole people and yet though it alone is national it has no originative voice in domestic national policy The sum of the matter is that we have carried the application of the notion that the powers of government must be separated to a dangerous and unheardof length by thus holding our only national representative the executive at armslength from Congress whose very commission it seems to be to represent not the people but the communities into which the people are divided We should have Presidents and cabi 1897 353354 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Sept nets of a different calibre were we to make it their bounden duty to act as a committee for the whole nation to choose and formulate matters for the consideration of Congress in the name of a party and an ad ministration and then if Congress consented to the measures what they are already a committee to execute them make them work and approve themselves practicable and wise And that is exactly what we ought to do We should have not a little light thrown daily and often when it was least expected upon the conduct of the departments if the heads of the departments had daily to face the representatives of the people to propose defend explain administrative policy upon the floor of the Houses where such a plan would put them and heads of departments would be happy under such a system only when they were very straightforward and honest and able men I am not suggesting that initiative in legislation be by any means confined to the adminis tration that would be radical indeed but only that they be given a free though responsible share in it and that I conceive would bring the government back very nearly to the conception and practice of AVashington It would be a return to our first models of statesmanship and political custom I ask you to put this question to yourselves Should we not draw the executive and legislature closer together Should we not on the one hand give the individual leaders of opinion in Congress a better chance to have an intimate part in determining who should be President and the President on the other hand a better chance to approve himself a statesman and his advisers capable men of affairs in the guidance of Congress This will be done when the executive is given an authoritative initiative in the Houses I see no other way to create national figures in the field in which domestic policy is chosen or to bring forward tested persons to vote for I do not suggest methods this is not the place or the occasionI suggest an idea a way out of chaos the nationalization of the motive power of the government to offset the economic sectionalization of the country I suggest the addi tion to Congress which represents us severally of a power constituted how you will which shall represent us collectively in the proposing of laws which shall have the right as of course to press national motives and courses of action to a vote in the Congress This will not subordi nate Congress it may accept the proposals of the administration or not as it pleases it once took a scolding from Washington himself for not accepting them but the country will at least have a mouthpiece and not all of policy will lurk with committees and in executive ses sions of the Senate

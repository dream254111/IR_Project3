the defendant is guilty of murder People v Roberts Mich 178 N W 690 At common law suicide or selfmurder is a felony State v Levelle 34 S C 120 27 Am St Rep 799 But since the selfmurderer himself was beyond the pale of human punishment the common law sought to prevent the crime by attaching to it an ignominious burial in the highway with a stake driven through the body and a forfeiture of goods 4 BL COM 190 And if one counsel another to commit suicide and the other acting upon such advice takes his own life the adviser is guilty of murder Commonwealth v Bowen 13 Mass 356 7 Ann Dec 154 By the old common law rule if he was present at the com mission of the act he was guilty of murder as a principal but if he was absent he was a mere accessory before the fact and since he could not be tried until the principal had first been tried and convicted he escaped punishment Rex v Russell 1 M C C 356 So also if a person kills another upon the desire or command of the latter he is guilty of murder yet the person killed is not looked upon as a felo de se for his assent being contrary to law is void 1 RUSSELL CRIMES 8th Am ed 506 And if two persons agree to commit suicide together and the means employed to procure death take effect upon one only the survivor is guilty of the murder of the one who dies Blackburn v State 23 Ohio St 146 Reg v Alison 8 Car  P 418 In the principal case however there was no agreement or persua sion on the part of the defendant he merely at his wifes request and bidding mixed the poisonous potion and placed it within her reach It is submitted that this decision is undoubtedly sound The law has too high a regard for human life to suffer it to be lightly tampered with It protects the lives of those to whom life is a burden as well as those in the full tide of lifes enjoyment Blackburn v State supra DAMAGESLOSS OF USE OF GoDG OODGODS USED FOR PLEASURE PURPOSES ONLYThe plaintiff owned an automobile which he used for both business and pleasure It was damaged by the negligence of the de fendant and was laid up ten days for repairs the repairs costing 8050 During this time the plaintiff was deprived of its use but did not hire another to take its place He thereupon brought action for damages resulting from the defendants negligence The lower court awarded the plaintiff 8050 for the cost of repairs and also 10000 for the loss of the use of the machine for the ten days The defendant appealed as to the award of the 10000 The appellate court conceded for the sake of argument that the car was used solely for pleasure purposes Held the plaintiff

Oklahoma An Okla homa statute provided No person who is convicted of having taken or causes or procures another so to take the life of another shall inherit from such person or receive any interest in the estate of the decedent or take by devise or legacy or descent or distribution from him or her any portion of his or her estate A statute similar in all material respects to the Oklahoma statute was in force in Kansas at the time The plaintiff brought action to recover her one half statutory interest in the decedents Oklahoma land Held the plaintiff may recover Harrison v Moncravie 264 Fed

is not effected by the conviction of a felony in the courts of another State or in a federal court Logan v United States 144 U S 263 Samuels v Commnon wealth 110 Va 901 66 S E 222 See also Brown v United States 233 Fed 353 L R A 1917A 1133 and note The laws of a State relating to intestate succession of property within its jurisdiction have no ex traterritorial effect except such as is allowed by comity Colvin v Jones 194 Mich 670 161 N W 847 And so far as creditors are con cerned each State will deal with a decedents property within its ju risdiction according to its own laws Vansickle v Hazeltine 29 Idaho 228 158 Pac 326 Estate of Apple 66 Cal 432 6 Pac 7 In the absence of statute the weight of authority is to the effect that the courts have no power to except murderers from the operation of statutes of descent and the guilt of the accused will not prevent his inheriting from the victim McAllister v Fair 72 Kan 533 84 Pac 112 3 L R A N S 726 and note 115 Am St Rep 233 7 Ann

N S 244 Under this last view it has been held that where a husband murders his wife and then kills himself his es tate is not seized of an entire estate in property which he and his wife held as tenants by entireties though the crime was not committed to secure the property and the husband clearly could not benefit by his act Van Alstyne v Tuffy 169 N Y Supp 173 On the other hand even where a statute exists prohibiting any person from inheriting from 149VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW one whom he has feloniously killed it has been held that a husband does become seized of an entire estate in property which he and his wife held as tenants by entireties when the death of the wife was caused by his felonious act Beddingfield v Estill 118 Tenn 39 100 S W 108 9 L R A N S 640 11 Ann Cas 904 For right of

this writ of habeas corpus claiming his detention to be illegal Held petition dismissed Ex parte Forbes Ala App 85 So 590 In extradition proceedings a requisition of the executive authority of a State accompanied by a sworn copy of the accusation and a warrant of the governor of the surrendering State authorizing arrest creates a presumption that a crime has been committed in the demanding State

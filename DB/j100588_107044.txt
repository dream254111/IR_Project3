Involved in the Survivorship By William Morgan Esq F R S,i206955,92 11 On the Method of determining fion the real Probabilities of Lfe the Values of Contingent fReversions in which three Lives are involved in the Survivorship By William Morgan Esq FIRS Read December 12 1799 ON SURVIVORSHIPS rfHE several papers which I have had the honour of communi cating to the Royal Society on the doctrine of contingent re versions contain the greater number of those cases in which three lives are concerned in the survivorship With the view of completing this subject I have been induced to investigate the remaining problems and having succeeded in the solution of them I hope the following will not be considered as an impro per addition to my former communications Being anxious to render this paper as concise as possible I have omitted to state at length the different contingencies on which the payment of the given sum depends trusting that from an attentive perusal of my former demonstrations these will appear to be so plainly expressed by the several fractions in each problem as to render a more ample description of them unnecessary PROBLEM I To determine the value of a given sum payable on the deathAfr MORGAN on Survivorshbis 23 of A or B should either of them be the first or second that fails of the three lives A B and C Solution In this case the payment of the given sum must certainly take place on tthe extinction of the joint lives of A and B inde pendent of C and therefore the value of the reversion will be S  r  V AB r The fractions expressing the contingencies on

therefore the sum of tie valucs of an annuity on the life of B after A provided A should die before C and of an annuity on the life of A after B provided B should die before C both found by the

prevented ultimately from taking place and there is only the single contingency of Cs being the first tiat fails of the three lives which can postpone the possession of it after the extinction of the joint lives The whole value therefore of the reversion after the joint lives of A and B must in this case be lessened by the sum of the values of an annuity on As life after B provided B should

consequently the value of a given sum is S x 2r xV 3C3CC CCCasbefore But the rules derived from the foregoing solution are in general more simple than those derived from the two problems just mentioned and are therefore to be preferred to them The foregoing problems together with those which have been investigated in my former papers comprehend as far as I can perceive all the different cases of survivorship between three lives The great number of contingencies on which these reversions depend must necessarily render the solutions intri cate and consequently the general rules complicated and la borious It would not however be a difficult task to abridge these rules very considerably without destroying their accuracy in any great degree but this would be foreign to my purpose in these papers which has uniformly been confined to the inves tigation of the correct values of the different reversions Nor do I think that such an abridgement is necessary as the opera tions of even the longest of the present rules may be completed in very nearly as short a time as the inaccurate approximations which have hitherto been employed for the same purpose It may not be improper to observe that the solutions in these papers are not only the first which have ever been deduced in the case of two and three lives from just principles and the real probabilities of life but that as to many of the problems not even an attempt has ever been made to approximate to the value of the reversion Being now possessed of correct solutions of all the cases in which two and three lives are involved in the survivorship we are possessed of all that is really useful and therefore I feel theMr MORGAN On Survivorsbips greater satisfaction in closing my inquiries on this subject For in regard to contingencies depending on four or more lives the cases are not only much too numerous and intricate to admit of a solution but they occur so seldom in practice as to render the entire investigation of them were it even possible a matter of little or no importance Ln my last Paper printed in the Phil Trans for the year 1794 page Z27 last line but one fr B WCB red Pkri VBCz BC   read

MENTIONED AND ARE THEREFORE TO BE PREFERRED TO THEM THE FOREGOING PROBLEMS TOGETHER WITH THOSE WHICH HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED IN MY FORMER PAPERS COMPREHEND AS FAR AS I CAN PERCEIVE ALL THE DIFFERENT CASES OF SURVIVORSHIP BETWEEN THREE LIVES THE GREAT NUMBER OF CONTINGENCIES ON WHICH THESE REVERSIONS DEPEND MUST NECESSARILY RENDER THE SOLUTIONS INTRI CATE AND CONSEQUENTLY THE GENERAL RULES COMPLICATED AND LA BORIOUS IT WOULD NOT HOWEVER BE A DIFFICULT TASK TO ABRIDGE THESE RULES VERY CONSIDERABLY WITHOUT DESTROYING THEIR ACCURACY IN ANY GREAT DEGREE BUT THIS WOULD BE FOREIGN TO MY PURPOSE IN THESE PAPERS WHICH HAS UNIFORMLY BEEN CONFINED TO THE INVES TIGATION OF THE CORRECT VALUES OF THE DIFFERENT REVERSIONS NOR DO I THINK THAT SUCH AN ABRIDGEMENT IS NECESSARY AS THE OPERA TIONS OF EVEN THE LONGEST OF THE PRESENT RULES MAY BE COMPLETED IN VERY NEARLY AS SHORT A TIME AS THE INACCURATE APPROXIMATIONS WHICH HAVE HITHERTO BEEN EMPLOYED FOR THE SAME PURPOSE IT MAY NOT BE IMPROPER TO OBSERVE THAT THE SOLUTIONS IN THESE PAPERS ARE NOT ONLY THE FIRST WHICH HAVE EVER BEEN DEDUCED IN THE CASE OF TWO AND THREE LIVES FROM JUST PRINCIPLES AND THE REAL PROBABILITIES OF LIFE BUT THAT AS TO MANY OF THE PROBLEMS NOT EVEN AN ATTEMPT HAS EVER BEEN MADE TO APPROXIMATE TO THE VALUE OF THE REVERSION BEING NOW POSSESSED OF CORRECT SOLUTIONS OF ALL THE CASES IN WHICH TWO AND THREE LIVES ARE INVOLVED IN THE SURVIVORSHIP WE ARE POSSESSED OF ALL THAT IS REALLY USEFUL AND THEREFORE I FEEL THEMR MORGAN ON SURVIVORSBIPS GREATER SATISFACTION IN CLOSING MY INQUIRIES ON THIS SUBJECT FOR IN REGARD TO CONTINGENCIES DEPENDING ON FOUR OR MORE LIVES THE CASES ARE NOT ONLY MUCH TOO NUMEROUS AND INTRICATE TO ADMIT OF A SOLUTION BUT THEY OCCUR SO SELDOM IN PRACTICE AS TO RENDER THE ENTIRE

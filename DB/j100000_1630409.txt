object 2 Years ago at meetings of the association the late W A Rogers in Boston and E S Morse in Detroit strenuously advocated the presentation of no papers that did not present the results of original work Professor Cope often took the same ground not infrequently helping to reject papers because of their pop ular nature I have recently thought it desirable to have a number of speakers selected by ofEcers of the sections perhaps with the approval of the council to present some topic or series of topics in a popular way to attract  outsiders It would hardly be safe to permit any volun teers to present papers on a popular topic 3 Education economies but not philology a Once a year preferably in winter till this date has had a fair trial S Meet most of the time in populous re

EDITOR OF SCIENCE In the A men can Natural1st for February is a paper by Miss iE G Mitchell purporting to date from Cornell University and expressing acknowledg ments to Instructor H D I eed and myself Besides some typographic errors it contains so many incorrect generic and specific names that in justice to the university and our selves Dr Reed and I feel obliged to dis claim responsibility for them Two years ago some dissections and observations were made by Miss Mitchell in this laboratory and she was probably encouraged to complete and pub lish them But at that time our concern was with the subjectmatter and we did not un dertake to verify the names of the fishes e2 amineds Neither the manuscript nor a proof has been submitted to us recently as would have been required before assenting to publi cation as if from the department Others like ourselves probably query why the paper was not passed upon by the ichthyological editor of the NaturaZist A list of corrections has been sent to Miss Mitchell in Louisiana with the expectation that she will request their immediate publication BURT G WILDER aA N Y May 2 1904 SPEClAL ARTICLES A REFERENCE TO THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES IN AN EARIY LETTER  1796  SIGNED BY BOTH LAMAROR AND GEOFFROY AMONG the papers of the elder Peale which were recently dispersed in Philadelphia was a fourpage letter in folio on official paper signed by Lamarok as director of the Museum of Natural History and by GeofEroy as  pro fessor and secretary The writing is in the hand of GeofEroy and it is accordingly fair to assume the composition and the doing into English were also his The ideas however are subscribed to by Lamarek  for director in his characteristic hand One might add that manuscripts connected with Lamarek are rare in fact few are known which touch upon variation in species and the present letter may therefore be quoted literatim for what it contains of an estra philosophical nature will be at least of human interest as indicating the type of correspond ence which such a man as Peale would have read to hls colleagues of the Academy of Natural Sciences at ParSN 30 JUnY 1796 LIBERT2 tGALITE FRATERNITE MUSEUM NATIONAL DHISTOIRE NATURELLE THE PROFESSORS DIRECTORS OF THE NATIONAL MU SEUM OF NATURAL HISTOPY TO MR PEALES AT PHILADELPIIIA Sir Mr Beauvois has transmitted us the letter wich you directed to him by wich you propose yoursel to enter into a correspondance with the Museum of Natural History of the french Nation We are pleased to seize an opportunity wich can afford us some communication with a Naturalist of your merit Every thing you announce isSCIEflNCE XtY 20 1904 799 agreable and will be equally useful on both sides VVe shall send you with pleasure and care a col lection of the European productions in exchange for the Americans which your love for the sci ence of Nature impels you to collect be so kind as to correspond with us on this subject The way by wich your letters and your sendings can reach us is simple Direct your instructions to the Minister of the Marine of the french re publique marking on the direction that they are destined for the Museum of Natural Eistory Give us leave Sir to call your attention on the subjects wich we desire to receive first Those enormous bones wich are found in great quantity on the borders of the Ohio the exact knowledge of those objects is more important towards the theory of the earth tthan is generally thought of We ardently wish some couples of alive animals db bourses  Marsupialia opossums   Their gen eration is too hypothetical The french Natural ists wish to acquire at last a soli opinion on this important question wich can throw a light on the generation in general The scalpel may perhaps lead us to discover particular organs wich have not yet been described wich might aSord us some new views We also desire some species of quadrupeds of your climate they have some conformity with those of the ancient continent they are even been confounded with olle another Neverthelss we think they diSer as to their species and to be as sured of it positively we should be pleased to re ceive indistinctly all those you could have gath ered Ve are about to proove that no species of the ancient continent exists in the new et vice versA and that great proof founded in the contrary opinion by wich both continents were formerly united towards the north would fall as groundless Therefox e it would be highly important to us to know the Bears of the Illinois the stags and Roebucks of Canada the stairsf the mountain Rats Marmottes  the weasels  Belettes  the Bats Chauvre souris the moles taupes the martes les martes the beavers les Castors ou bievres etc We should be grateful if you would join to these the animals of our own country wich have transmitted in our ships to your country as the rats the mouses the soreac araneus mus araigne It is incredible what variety these animals oSer to the attentive eye How many analogous forms are taken for Species It would be interesting to know what degeneration their transplantation has produced on their economy They would lead us   indiscriminately t  Bisoll to a more exact knowledge on the nature of the Species and even of the Species sin mgeneral Spiritous liquors are theSbest means of preserving of all those animals by this mean we will ac quire with respect to foreign animals all the most striking facts wich they oSer to the observator 57e know better their external form their skeletton their organes of nutrition of respiration of circulation of generation and to finish ani mals always arive in a good condition AIt is the manner in wich we shall transmit to you all our animals wether quadrupeds or birds or insects if these animals are of a smale size unless you prefer the ordinary means As to great animals whose preservation in spirituous liquor would be too dispendious we would be satisfied with the skins but for gods sake leave to the skin the scull and bones of the feet We would be equally grateful if you would add to your envoys a skeleton separated from the great animals whose form is dif3Cerent from that of those species well known in Europe and to use the language of Naturalists a skeletton o each gender Ve shall pay the same regard to you We shall not fail of sending you preparations as we wish them form you convinced that it is tQ the progress of Natural Eistory We already possess a sufficient quantity of smal birds from north America however the list of those wanting in consulting the work of Catesby is considerable you will find it withthis letter By this mean you will be informed that all the birds marked by Catesby wich are not inscribed on the list form a part of our precious collection and zare less necessary than the others We wished Sir that our correspondance should not be confined to the exchanges of European productiorls with American only be to kind as to make it litterary send us the catalogue of all the works appearing on Natural iEfistory in the united States Let us know the history of that science by your know corporations of learned men instituted to its progress Depend on the reciprb cation on our part Inquire Sir after all the particulas do not fear to swell your letter I shall give it ful credit as much as it lays in my power When the means shall be deScient I shall write it to you with frankness Accept Sir the assurance of our estim and obedience LAMARCK GEOFFROY for dtrector Professor axd Secretary of the Ad mintstration of t77e M1X sexnz of Natural Eistory  v Expensive r800 SCIENCE N S VOL XIX N0 490 The obvious interest of the foregoing letter is in its tettimony that the writers were keenly alert as to transformism at this early date 1796 and that they had even marked out an important line of inquirycomparison of old world species with new world species and a study of the variation of those forms which had been introduced and allowed to run wild for a considerable period possibly a hundred years In other words they are seeking  a more exact knowledge on the nature of the species and even of the species in general And they clearly assume the importance of evolution when they aim to measure the amount of change degeneration which trans plantation has caused in the economy of mammals Especially conspicuous is the im portance which is apparently attributed to the Buffonian factor  we also desire some species of quadrupeds from your climates  It is incredible what variety these animals oSer to the attentive eye There is even a crude notion of parallelism in the remark that  many analogous forms are taken for species Noteworthy also is their interest in the paleon tological evidence for the bones from salt licks are expected to yield important evidence as to  the theory of the earth And we may conclude that Lamarek had evidently his Hydrogeologie 1802 as well as transformism in mind in his search for evidences as to dis tinctness of species widely separated geo graphically when he theorizes as to the ancient outlines of continents and maintains that no species of the ancient continent exist in the new The present paper moreover narrows the probability that Lamarek borrowed his trans formism from Doctor Darwin Fors Iamarek is not known to have had evolutional tend encies before about 1799 and it has accord ingly been stated that the Zoonomia 1794 was the slowly working cause of his con version By the present evidence moreover he was enterprisingly investigating the nature and variability of species as early as the spring of 1796  e less than two years after the publication of Darwins work and possibly before it was circulated abroad Indeed even in England there is little reference to it be fore 1798 and Paleys attack upon Darwinism did not appear till 1802 Of certain interest is the literary partnership of Lamarek and GeofEroy in philosophical matters at this early date GeofEroy was then but twentyfour years of age and this is as far as I am aware the earliest record of his interest in the origin of species It antedates by several years his studies on the mummied fauna of Egypt and we may naturally query whether he may not already have had in mind to test the possibil ities of variation by comparison of the early and late  productions  of the valley of the Nile before Napoleon had laid his plans for an actual invasioll  BASHFORD DEAN COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY THE NATURE OF THE PELEE TOWER THE recent publication of a note by Pro fessor Lacroix Corr6ptes Rendus Mareh 20 1904 on the production of quartziferous rocks in the course of the actual eruption of Mont Pelee and the stated conclusion arrived at by the distinguished French geologist that rocks of this character and by analogy other igneous rocks of more clearly marked figure such as microgranulite and even true granite may be formed superficially and do not re quire in their construction deepseated pres sure conditions which have long since been recognized even if the processes of formation had not before been observed afford perhaps a sufficient reason for me to state my belief that the giant obelisk of rock which at the time of its greatest development the close of May of last year towered out of the crateral opening of the volcano to a height of nearly 1000 feet and had there been no summit breakages would probably have risen a full thousand feet higher had not the structure that was assigned to it by Lacroix namely that it represented an exceedingly viscous acidic lava which solidified immediately on its extrusion alld rose vertically under volcanic stress illstead of flowing off in the manner of the llormal lavastreams This seemingly simple explanation of one of the most remark able structural orms of the earths surface has apparently been accepted by most geolog ists and my own earlier studies led me to the same collelusion A later critical examina

j100983,Journal of the American Geographical Society of New York,197192,Map Notices,i210229,MAP NOTICES BY HENRY GANNETT THE ACTIVE INTEREST which has recently been awakened in for ests and forestry has received another illustration in the issue by the Geological Survey of the State of a series of forest maps of New Jersey The first of these represents the entire State upon a scale of five miles to an inch showing by shades of color the propor tion which the wooded areas bear to the total area The principal wooded area of New Jersey is in its southern level part South of latitude 400 20 these plains are almost solidly covered with forest principally if not entirely of yellow pine The secondary area is in the ridges and hills of the northern part of the State especially near the boundary with New York Here also the proportion of timber land runs very high Besides this map the Geological Survey has issued six sheets upon a scale of one mile to an inch showing in detail the wooded areas of the northern half of the State These maps accompany reports upon the woodland and forests of the State by Mr C C Vermeule Gifford Pinchot and others constituting the greater part of the Annual Report of the Survey for the year 1899 The iranscontinental Triangulation and the American Arc of the Par aIlel Special Publication No 4 U S Coast and Geodetic Survey Washingion Government Printinzg Office 1900 Quarto pp 87o With MAany Cuts and Other Illustrations and Two Maps The measurement by geodetic methods of the arc of the par allel of 39g north latitude within the limits of the United States was commenced in 1872 and completed in I898a period of twenty seven years The eastern end of this arc is at Cape May N J in longitude 740 56 and the western end at Point Arena Cal in longitude T23 42 The length of the arc is 2625 miles or in longitude 480 46 This is the longest arc of a meridian ever meas ured by any one Government and its measurement is one of the most important if not the most important contribution to a knowl edge of the shape and size of the earth which has ever been made Moreover this belt of triangulation provides no fewer than sixteen 497498 Matp Notices States with a fundamental and reliable basis for the extension of topographic surveys In the course of this work ten baselines have been measured and expanded viz on Kent Island Md which is the most eastern at St Albans in West Virginia at Holton Ind Olney Ills and in the American Bottom in the same State opposite St Louis at Versailles Mo Salina Kan Colorado Springs Colo Salt Lake Utah and the Yolo base in the Sacramento Valley of California Altogether 308 stations have been occupied in the triangulation At 109 stations the latitude has been determined astronomically at 73 stations azimuth has been determined and at 37 stations longitude has been determined by the use of the telegraph The eastern portion of this belt passes mainly through a country of wooded hills and mountainsthe Appalachians which present many serious difficulties though none of them were new to the men engaged upon the work The central portion is through a region partially timberedprairies or barren plainsand here the difficul ties were not great Through both these sections the distances be tween stations are comparatively small but in the western portion of the beltthat is from the Rocky Mountain front in Colorado west to the Pacific coastthe conditions are quite different The stations consist almost entirely of high mountains ranging from 9ooo to 14000 feet and more in altitude The figures are large the dis tances between stations being on an average fully I00 miles and in one casefrom Uncompahgre Peak in the San Juan Mountains of Colorado to Mount Ellen in the Henry Mountains of Utahthe distance is approximately i8o miles The adjustment of the system has been made simply After making the station adjustments the figure forming the expansion about each baseline was adjusted by itself then each belt of tri angulation connecting one base expansion with the next was ad justed to itself and to the adjusted base expansions at its extremities It has been found as a result of this measurement that the form and dimensions of the 39th parallel within the United States do not conform either to the Clarke or the Bessel spheroid but that it lies between the two An interesting incident connected with the results is the fact that the difference in station error between Colorado Springs at the east base of the Rocky Mountains and Salt Lake City at the west base of the Wasatch Mountains is upon the Clarke spheroid not less than 46 or nearly threefourths of a mile This difference is of course easily accounted for by the topographic surroundings of the two placesMaap Notices 499 Throughout the work differences of altitude were carefully meas ured by the method of zenith distances and thus a continuous series of altitudes was carried across the continent During these twentyseven years there has been expended upon the triangulation the sum of 500000 in addition to the salaries of the men engaged upon it The cost per linear mile of triangula tion in such regions as Maryland and Delaware which consist of partially timbered rolling country was 103 while in California where the stations were upon high mountains and where large figures were employed the cost was 463 Measured by the areas included however the result is quite different Thus in Indiana and Illinois a partially timbered and rather level region the cost was i r per square mile while in Colorado where the stations were high and lines long the cost was only about 2 per square mile Measured by the cost per station occupied the results again are different In Indiana and Illinois the cost per station was 1725 while in Colorado it was not less than 6131 In conclusion mention should be made of the fact that the reductions of the geodetic work and the publication of the book have all been effected within the short space of two years from the completion of the field worka most notable example of rapidity of execution and publication

tmro objectsthe one the preventior of damage to buildings and the other the prevention of finjury to life In order to destroty a huilding in whole or in part it is necessary that work should be done that is as physicists express it erlergy is required Just beforie the lightning discharge takes place the energy capable of doing the darnage which we seek to prevent exists in the column of air extending from the cloud to the earth in some form that makes it capable of appearing as what we call electricity We will therefore call it electrical enery What this electrical energy is it is not necessary for us to consider in this place but that it exists there can be no doubt as it manifests itself in the destructton of buildings The problem that we have to deal E itb therefore is the conversion of this energy into some other form and the accomplishmlent of this in such a way as shall result in the least injury to property and life Why have the Old Rods Failed  When lightningrods were first produced the science of energetics vvas entirely undeveloped that is to say in the middle of the last century scientific men had not come to recognize the fact that the different forms of energyheat electricity mechanical power etcvvere convertible one into the other and that each could produce just so much of each of the other foI ms and no more The doctrine of the conservation and correlation of energy was first clearly worked out in the early part of this century There were however some facts known in regard to electricity a hundred and forty years ago and among these were the attracting power of points for an electric spark and the conducting power of metals Lightningrods were therefore introduced with the idea that the electricity existing in the lightuing discharge could be conveyed around the building which it was proposed to protect and that the building would thus be saved The question as to dissipation of the energy involved was entirely ignored naturally and from that time to this ill spite of the hest endeavors of those interested lightningrods constructed in accordance with iE ranklins principle have not furnished satisfactory protection The reason for this is ap parent when it is considered that this electrical energft exist ing in the atmosphere before the dischatge or more exactlyX in the column of dielectric from the cloud to the earth above referred to reaches its maximurn value on the surface of the conductors that chance to be within the column of dielectric so that the greatest display of energy will be on the surface of the very lightningrods that were meant to protect and damage results as so often proves to be the case It will be understood of course that this display of energy on the surface of the old lightningrods is aided by their being more or less insulated from the earth but in any event the very existence of such a mass of metal as an old lightningrod can only teLld to produee a disastrous dissipatioll of electrical energy upon its surface  to dravv the light ning as it is so commonlyX put Is  there a Better Means of Protection  Having cleared oura minds therefore of any idea of conducting electricity and keeping clearly in view the fat that in providing protection against lightning vve must fur nish some means by which the electrical energy may be harmlessly dissipated the question arises  Can an improvedl form be given to the rod so that it shall aid in this dissipa tion   As the electrical energy involved manifests itself on the surface of eonductors the irnproved rod should be metallie but instead of making a large rod suppose that we make it comparatively small in size so that the total amourlt of metal running from the top of the house to some point a little below the foundations shall not exceed one pound Suppose again that vve introduce numerous insulating joints irl this rod We shall then have a rod that experience shows will be readily destroyedwill be readily dissipatedwhen adischarge takes place and it will be evident that so far as the electrieal energy is consumed in doing this there will be the less to do other damage The only point that remains to be proved as to the utiTity of such a rod is to show that the dissipation of such a condue tor does not telld to injure other bodies in its immediate vicinity 0n this point I can only say that I have found no ease where sueh a conductor for instance a small wire or gilding has been dissipated esren if resting agaillst a plas tered wall where there has been any material damage done to surrounding objects Of course it is readily understood that such an explosion cannot take place in a confined space without the rupture of the walls the wire canrlot be boarded over but in every case that I have found recorded this dissipation takes place just as gunpowder burns when spread out on a board The objects against which the conductor rests may be stained but thef7 are not shattered I svould therefore make clear this distirletion between the aetion of electrieal energy when dissipated on the surfaee of a large eonduetor and when dissipated on the surfaee of a eomparatively small or easily dissipated eonduetor When dissipated on the surface of a large conductor a conduc tor so strong as to resist the explosive eSect danaage re sults to objects around When dissipated on the surface of a small conductor the conductor goes but the other objzects around are saved A Typical Case of the Action of a Small Conductor Franklin in a letter to Collinson read before the Royal Society Dec 18 175S describing the partial destruction by lightning of a churchtower at Newbury Mass wrote  Near the bell was fixed an iron hammer to strike the hours and from the tail of the hammer a wire went down through a small gimlethole in the floor that the bell stood upon and through a second floor in like manner then6hori SCIENCEw28 SCIENCEo VOL XVII No 422 zontally under and near the plastered ceiling of that second foor till it came near a plastered wall then down by the side of that wall to a clock which stood about twenty feet below the bell The vvire was not bigger than a common knitting needle The spire was split all to pieces by the lightning and the parts flung in all directions olrer the square in 1vhich the church stood so that nothing retnained above the bell The lightning passed between the hammer and the clock in the above mentioned wire without hurting either of the floors or having any eSect upon them except making the gimletholes through which the wire passed a little bigger and without hurting the plastered wall or any gpart of the building so lar as the aforesaid wire and the pendulaxnwire of the clock exterlded which latter wire was about the thickness of a goosequill From the end of the pendulum down quite to the ground the building was ex ceedingly rent and damaged    No part of the aforemen tioned long small wire between the clock and the hammer could be found except about two inches that hung to the tail of the hammer and about as much that vvas fastened to the clock the rest being exploded and itsl particles dissi pated in smoke and air as gunpowder is by common fire and had only left a black smutty track on the plastering three or four inches broad darkest in the middle and fainter towards the edges all along the ceiling under which it passed and down the wall Mathematical Theory There is stored up in each cubic centimetre of the column of dielectric from the cloud to the earth just before the lightningdischarge an amount of electrical energy given by the expression t KE2 where K is the specific inductive 8t dcapacity of the dielectric air and Ethe electromotive in tensity both in electrostatic units This expression is given on p 156 Yol I second edition of Maxwels  Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism Substituting the values of K and E remembering of course that they are in electlostatic units and reducing we find that the amount of energy in solved amounts very nearly to one footpound for each cubic ifoot of air involved If we cvnsider that the disbsipation of this electrical exlergy takes place throughout the whole length of the column of dielectric fronn the cloud to the earth we shall see that all the energy that we have to care for ill our lightningrod is that existing in the section of the column contained between two horizontal planes passing through the top and foundation of our house respectively This may not of course be strictly true but it mllst be essentially No reason can be assigned why the electrical energy should disappear at the top or at the bottom or at the centre of the column of dielectric in which it exists so tilat it is reasonable to Inaintain that what we call al lightningflash is simply a line of air in which the electrical energy is being dissipated as heat The energy therefore is transmitted not frotn the cloud to the earth or from the earth to the cloud but horizontally from all portions of the dielectric to some central core where it appears as heat and where the phenomenon we call a lightningflash is manifested One result of this consideration is that in order to pro duce the aTnount of energy which is known to exist in lightningdischarges tha radius of the column of dielectric at the surface of the earth must be very considerable in order that there shall be a sufficient mass of air to furnish at the rate of one footpound per cubic foot enough energy to preduce the wellknown results N D J HODGES ARISTOTLE AS A NATUELALISTA HAVINGS had occasion of late years to make myself acquainted with the observations and ideas of ancient writers upon matters connected with natural history and having been thus more than ever impressed bJ the unique position vvhich in this respect is held by Aristotle it appears to me that a short essay upon the subject may prove of interestto readers of various kinds Therefore as far as space permits I will render the results of my own inquiries in this direction but as it is far frorn an easy task to estimate with justice the scientific claims of so rescientifie a writert I shall be greatly obliged to more professed students of Aristotle if they will indicate either publicly or privately any errors of fact or of judg ment into which it may appear that I have fallen Aristotle died BC 322 ill the sixtythird year of his age As a personal friend and devoted pupil of Plato who in turn was a friend and pupil of SocratesShis tnind was at an early age brought under the imtnediate influence of the best thinking of antiquity Nevertheless although entertaining a profound ven eration for his master like a true devotee of truth he did not allow his mind to becoule unduly dominated even by the authority of so august a tutor and in afterlife he expressly broke away fro1n the more rnystical principles of Platonic method NVhile still a young man he was invested with the magnificent office of educating Alexander the Great IIe held this position for a period of four years and then the young prince at the age of eighteen became regent It is interesting to note that the relations which subsisted between this greatest philosopher and this greatest gen eral in the worlds history were throughollt relations of warmest friendship Indeed had it not been for the nlunificent aid which was aftel wards given by Alexander it would have been impossi Eble Ieor Aristotle to have prosecuted the work which he accom plished Questions have been raised not only as to the authenticity of this work but al30 as to the originality of much that is undoubtedly au thentic Into these questions however I need not go Whether or not Aristotle borrowed from other writers without acknowledgment it is certain that in his writings alone are preserved the records of early biological thought and observation which would otherwise have been lost and the preservation of these records is of more importance for our present purpose than is the question to whom such thought and observation nvere in every case due Whether we look to its width or to its depth we must alike conclude that the range of Aristotles work is wholly without a parallel in the history of mankind Indeed it ulay be said that there is scarcely any one department of intellectual activity where the mind of this intellectual giant has not exerted more or less influence in some cases by way of creation in others by way of direction The folowing is a list of the subjects on which Aris totle 7rote physics astronomy meteorology zoology corxopara tive anatomy physiology and psychology poetry ethics rhetoric logic politics and metaphysics Of these sllbjects he was most suceessful in his treatment of the second series as I have arranged thein or of the more abstract and least rigidly scientific In his  Politics  he gave the outlines of two hundred and twentyfive constitutions and although but a fragment of his whole work in this direction has oome down to us it is still regarded as one of the best treatises that has ever been written on the subject EIis  Ethics  Rhetoric and  Logic also still present much more than a merely historical interest for he may be said to have correctly laid down the fundamental principles of these sciences his anaysis of the syllogism in particular having left but com paratively little for subsequent logicians to complete and lastlry his Metaphysics alone would have been sufficient to have plaeed him among the greatest thinkers of antiquity That his labors in the field of more exact science should not now present a comparable degree of valueS is of course inevita ble At the time when he wrote the verqy alethods of exact seience were unknown and I think it constitutes the strongest of all his tnany claims to our intellectual veneration that he was able to pereeive so largely as he did the superior value of the objective over the subjective tnethods in matters pertaining to natural sci Z From The DoIltemporary ReviewMARCH 6 I89I SCIENCEz 129 enee When we rernember bow inveterate and how universal is the bondage of all early thought to the subjective methods when we remember that for the best part of twenty centuries after the birth otAristotle the intellect of Europe was still held fast in the chains of that bondage and when we remember that even at the present time with all the advantages of a long and pain ful experience we find it so extremely difEicult to escape it when we remember thess things we can only marvel at the scien tific instinct of this rnan who although nurtured in the school of Plato was able to see darkly it may be and as it were in the glass of future things but still was able to see  that the true method of science is the rnethod of observation and experiment  Men who desire to learn he said  must first learn to doubt for science is onlsT ths solution of doubts and it is not possible more concisely to state the intellectual duty of scepticism or the paramount necessity of proof which thousands of years of wasted toil have now snabled all intelligent men lxkore or less to realize Nevertheless as I have said the vision of scientific method which Aristotle had was a vision of that which is only seen in part the image of the great truth which he perceived was largely distorted by passing through the medium of preexisting thought Conseqllently of late years a great deal of discussion has taken place on the subject of Aristotles method On the one hand it is rnaintained that he is entitled to the place which is usually assigned to Bacon as the father of the inductive methods while on the other hand it is maintained that in respect of method he didZ ot rnake any considerable advance upon his predeeessors In my opinion a just estirnate lies betsveen these two e2itremes Take for example the following passages from his writings  We must not accept a general principle from logic only but must rove its application to each faet for it is in facts that we must seek general principles and these must always accord with facts   The reason why men do not sllfficiently attend to the facts is their want of experience Hence those accustomed to physical inquiry are more eonlpetent to lay down the principles whieh have an e2hensive application whereas others who have been accus tomed to many assumptions without the apposition of reality easilg lay down prineiples beeause they take few things into eon sideration It is not diffleult to distinguish between those who argue from facts and those who argue from notions Many sinzilar passages to the same effect might be quoted and it is evident that the true Lnethod of inductive research could not well have itS Ieading principles rnore clearly enunciated and to say this rnuch is in itself enough to place Aristotle in theforemost rank among the scientific intellects of the world But it would be unreasonable to expect that this great herald of scientifie method should have been able with any powers of intellect to have entirely emancipated himself from the whole system of pre vious thought or in the course of a single lifetime to have fuly learned the great lesson of method which has only been taught by the best experience of more than twenty eenturies after his death Aceordingly we find that although he elearly divined the true principles of researeh he not unfrequently fell short in his appli cation of those prineiples to practiee In particular he had no adequate idea of the importance of verifying each step of a re search or each statement of an exposition and therefore it is painfully often that his ou7n words just quoted admit of being turned against himself It is easy to distinguish between those who argue from faets and those who argue from notions To give only a single example he says that if a woman who has searletfever looks at herself in a mirror the mirror will beeome suffused with a bloody mist which if the mirror be nezr can only be rubbed off with diffieulty Pow instead of proeeeding to verify this old wifes tale he attempts to explain the alieged faet by a rambling assemblage of absurd 4notions And numerous other instanees might be given to the same efEeet Nevertheless upon the whole or as a general rule in his thought and language in his rnode of conceiving and grappling with probletlls of a SGi entific kind in the importance which he assigns to the smallest factsS and in the general cast of reasoning whsch he employs Aristotle reseinbles mueb more closely than any other philoso pher o f like antiquity a seientie investigator of the present day Thus in seeking to form a just estimate of Aristotles work in natural history we must be eareful on the one hand to avoid thex extravagant praise wbich has been lavished upon him even by such authorities as Quvier De Blainville Isidore St Hilaire ete and on the other hand we must no less carefully avoid the un fairness of contrasting his working methods with those which have now become habitual In proceeding to consider the extraordinary labors of this ex traordinary man in so far as they were coneerned with naturaI history I may begin by enumerating but without waiting to name the species of animals with which we know that he evas aequainted From his works on natural history then we find that he mentions at least 70 species of mammals 150 of birds 2 Olc reptiles 116 of fish 84 of articulata and about 40 of lower ormsj making close upon 500 species in all That he was accus tomed from his earliest boyhood to the anatomical study of arlimal forms xve may infer from the fact of his father having been a physician of eminence and an Asclepiad for accjording to GEalene it was the custom of the Asclepiads to constitute disseetion part of the education Olc their children Therefore as Aristotles boy hood nvas passed upon the seaeoast it is probable that from a very early age his studies were directed to the anatomy and physiology of marine aninaals But of course it must not be eoncluded from this that the dissections then practised were eom parable with what we understand by dissections at the present time We find abundant evidenee in the writings of Aristotle himself that the only kind of anatomy then studied was anatomy of the grosser kind or such as might be prosecuted with a earv ingknife as distinguished from a scalpel  We generally hear it said that as a naturalist Aristotle was aS teleologist or a belieser in the doetrine of design as manifested int living things therefore I should like to begin by making it elear how far this statement is true for unquestionably when sueht an intellect as that of Aristotle is at work upon this important question it behooves us to consider exaetly what it was that he eoncluded Now I do not dispute  indeed it would be quite itnpossible to do so that Aristotle was a teleologist in the sense of being in every case anteeedently convinced that organic struetures are adapted to the performanceoof definite Ieunetions and that the organism as a whole is adapted to the conditions of its existence Thus Ieor example he very clearly says  As every instrument subserves some particular end that is to say some special func tion so the wShole body naust be destined to minister to some ple nary sphere of action just as the savv is made for sawingthis being its function and not sawing or the saw But in any other sense than this of recognizing adaptation in Nature I do not think there is evidence of Aristotle having been a teleologist In his  Metaphysics  he asks the question whether the principle of order and excellence in Nature is a selfesisting principle inherent from all eternity in Nature herself or whether it is like the diseipline of an army apparently inherent but really due to a general in the background Aristotle I say asks thi question but he gives no answer Sirnilarly in his Natural History he sirnply takes the faets of order and adaptation as facts of observation and therefore in biology I do not think that Aristotle can be justly credited with teleology in any other sense than a modern Darwinist can be so credited that is to say he is a believer in adaptation or final end but leaves in abeyance the question of design or final eause The only respect in whicn he differs from a modern Darwinist although even here the sehool of Wallaee and Weismann agree with him is in holdillg that adaptation must be present in all eases even where the adaptation is not apparent In the case of rudimentary organs he is puzzled to account for structures apparently aimless and therefore he in vents what we may term an imaginary aim by saying that Nature has supplied these structures as  tokens whereby to sustain her unity of plan This idea was prominently revived in modern preDarwinian times but in the present connection it is enough to observe that here as elsewhere Aristotle personifies Nature as a designing or contriving agency having the attainment of orderSCI ENCE VOL XVII No 422 3o and harmony as the final end or aim of all her work He appears however clearly to have recognized that so far at least as science i8 concerned such personification is as it were allegorical for he expresslv says that if he were asked whether Nature works out her designs with any such conscious deliberation or intentional adjustment of tneans to ends as is the case with a bllilder or a shipwright he would not be able to answer All therefore that the teleologsr of Aristotle amounted to was this he found that the hypothesis of purpose was a useful workillg hypothesis in his biological researches lhere is nothing to show that he would have followed the natural theologians of modern tiales who seek to rear upon this working hypothesis a construetisre ar gument in avor of design On the other hand it is certain that ne mrould have differed from these theologians in one important particular for he everywhere regards the purposes of Natllre as operating under limitations imposed by uhat he ealls absolute neeessity Monsters for example he says are rot the intentional work of Nature herself but instanees of the victory of tnatter os7er Nature that is to say they are installces svhere Natule has failed to satisfy those eonditions of neeessity under which she acts Thus even if there be a disposing mind which is the author of Nature aceording to Aristotle it is not the mind of a ereator but rather that of an arehiteet who does the best he can with the materials supplied to him and under the eonditions imposed bv neeessity Turning now to tlle aetual work whieh Alistotle accomplished in the domain of biology I ill first enumerate his more irnpor tant discoveries upon matters of fact and then proeeed to men ion his more important achievements in the w7ay of generalization He correctly viewed the blood as the mediurn of general nutri tiOIl and knew that for this purpose it moved through the blood vessels from the heart to all parts of the body although he did not know that it returned again to the heart and t hus was ignorant of what we now eall the circulation But he was the first to find that the heart is related to the bloodsrascular systelu and this he did by proving in the way of dissection that its cavities are continuous with those of the large veirls and arteries Nor did he end here IIe traced the course of these large veins and arteries giving an accurate account of their branchings ancl elis tribution He knew perfectly well that arteries contain blood and this is a matter of some importance because it has been the habit of llistorians of physiology to affirm that all the ancients supposed arteries to contain air Ill spealing of the caVities of the heart he appears to have fallen into the unaccountablv fool ish blander of saying that no animal has more than thlee and that some animals have as few as onev But although this ap parent error has been harped upon by his crities it is clearly no error at all Professor IIuxley has shown that what Aristotle here did was to regard the right auricle as a venous sinus or as a part of the great rein and not of the heart The only mistake of any importanee that he made in all his researches upon the anatomy of the heart and bloodvessels was in supposing that the number of cavities of the heart is in some lneasure determined by the size of the animal Helje he undollbtedly lays himself open to the charge of basing a general and erroneous statement on a precon ceived idsea without taking the trouble to test it by observation t sve may forgive him this little eRhibition of negligence when we find that it was cotrlnaitted by the same observers who cor rectly irlforms us that tha heart of the chick is first observable as a pulsating point on the third day of incubation or who graphi cally tells us that just as irrigating trenches in gardens are con structed to distribute water fx olrl one single source through numerous channels which divide and subdivide so as to convey it to all parts and thus to nourish the gardenplants which grow at the expense of the water so the blood vessels start frorn the heart in a ramifying system in ordel to conduct the nutritis e fluid to all regions of the body Lastly Aristotle experimented on coagulation of the blood and obtained accurate results as to the coznparative rateswith which the prooess takes place in the blood of different animals He also correctly deseribed the phe nomenon as due to the fortmation of a lueshwork of fibres but he appfars to have erroneously supposed that these fibres exist inthe blood before it is dtawn frul the body So much then for his views upon the heart the blood and the bloodvessels Ee was less fortunate in his teaching about the bladder kidneys liver spleen and so forth because he had DO sufficient physiological data to go upon Still Qne would think he might have avoided the error of attributing tSe formation of urine to the bladder seeing that he had gone so far as to perceive that the kidneys separate out the urine which as he correctly sayss then flows into the bladder His chaptexs on the digestive tract display a surprisinly extensive and detailed investigation of the alimentary systenas of many anitnals and the observations made are for the most part accurate In particular his descrip tions of the teeth cesophagus epiglottis and the mechanism of deglutition display so urprising an amount of careful and de tailed observation throughout the vertebrated series that they read much like a modern treatise upon these branches of com paratisre anatomy The sarne remark applies to his disquisition on horns Where inaccurate his mistakes here are mostly due to his ignorance of exotic forms Adipose tissue he correctly viewed as excess of nutritive matter extracted frorn the blood and he noted that fatness is inimical to propagation Marrow he likerise correctlv regalded as having to do with the nutrition of bones and observed that in the embryo it consists of a vascular pulp That Aristotle should have had no glimmering llotion either of the nervous systeal or of its functions is of course not surpris in but to me it is surprising that so acute an observer should have failed to perceive the physiological meaning of muscles Although he knesr that they are attached to bones that they occur in greatest bulk uhere most strength of movement is re quired such as in the arms and legs of man the breasts of birds and so forthand although he must have observed that the mus cles sTell and harden when the limbs rnove yet it never occurred to hirn to connect muscles with the phenornena of moxement He regarded them only as paddirlg having also in some way to do with the phenomena of sensation Thus we appear to hanJe one of those curious instances of feeble observation witb which every now and then he talies us by surprise To give paren thetically a still more strange exatllple of what I mean olle would think that there is nothing in the economy of a starfish or an echinus more conspicuous or more calculated to arrest attention than the atnbulacral system of tube feet yet Aristotles while describing many other parts of those animals is quite silent about this atnbulacral system I think this fact can only be explained by supposing that he confined his observations to dead specimens but as he was not an inlancl naturalist even this explanation does not acquit him of a charge of negligence wllich svhen contrasted with his customary diligenee appears to me extraor dinary His ignorafinee of the nervous system led hirn to a variety of speculatise errors In particular he was induced to regard the heart as the seat of mind and the brain as a bloodless organ whose funetion it was to cool the heart which he supposed to be not only the organ of mind bllt also an apparatus for cooking the blood and by it the food The respiratory sZrsteln was also con ceived by him as a supplementary apparatus for the purpose of keeping the body cool a curious illustration of early philo sopliical thought arriving at a conclusion whiGh to use his o7vn terminologv was directly opposed to the truth Nes ertheless the reasoning svhich landed him in this erroneous concltlsion 7vas not only perfectly sound but also based upon a large induction from facts the observation of which is highly creditable Tlle reason why he supposed the oXce of respiration to be that of cool ing the body was becallse nearly all anirllals which respire by means of lungs exhibit a high temperature and inlagining that temperature or  vital heat  sYas a propert sr of the living soul his inference was inevitahle that the tunction of the lungs was that of keeping down the temperature of warnblooSed animas Here then his error was due to deficiency of information and the same has to be said of the great ma30rity of his other errors For in stance with regard to the one already mentioned about the heart being the seat of mirld this is usually said by commentators to have been due merely to the accident of the heart occupying a central position and no doubt such was partly his reason for hePvI ARCH 6 I 89 1  SCIENCE 13I considered that position the noblest and repeatedly argues that on this account it must be the seat of mind But over and above this mystical not to say childish reason I think he must have ihad another for seeing that the error is a vely general one in early philosophical thoughtwe find it running through the Psalms and it is still conventionally retained by all poetic writers I think we must look for some more evident reason than that of mere position to account for it and this reason I take to be the perceptible influence on the heartbeat which is caused by emo tions of various kinds Furtheralore Aristotle expressly assigns the following as another of his reasons In the eLnbrgo the heart appears in motion before all other parts as if it were a living animal and as if it srere th0 beginning of all animals that have blood  Turnillg now for a moment to Aristotles still more detailed discoveries in comparative anatom y and physiology his most re markable researches are I thirk those on the Cetcece 7rustacea and Clephalopoda ESere the amount of nainute and accurate vb servation which he displayed is truly astonishing and in some eases hls stateinents on importallt matters of fact have only been verified in our own century such for instance as the peculiar mode of propagation w7hich has nosr been rediscovered in some of the Cephalo7oda He also knew the anomalous fact that in these animals the vitellus is joined to the mouth of the enrbr7o that in certain species of cartilaginous fish the elnblyo is attached to its parent b7 the intervention of a placentalike structure and in short detailed so many anatomical discoveries both as regards he s7ertel3rata and ins7ertebrata that a separate article would be required to make them intelligible to a general reader In this connection therefore I will only again insist upon the enormous difference between Aristotle and the great majority of his illus trious countrymen in respect of method Unless it can be shown that an ancient writer has been led to anticipate the results of modern discovery by the legitimate use of inductive methods he deserves no rnore credit for his guesses when they happen to have been right than he does when they happen to have heen wrong This however is a eonsideration whieh we are apt to negleet VVhen uTe find that an old philosopher has made a statement whieh eienee has afterwards shown to be true we are apt to regard the faet as proof of remarkable seientifie insight whereas when we investigate the reasonings whieh led him to propound the state ment we usually find that they axe of a puerile nature and only ihappened to hit the truth as it were by aecident Among a number E guesses made at random and in ignorance a eertain pereentage Inay well prove right but under these circumstanees the man who happens to make a correct guess deserves no more eredit than he rhcs happens to have made an erroneous one In deed he may deserve even less credit For instanee when the Pythagoreans cun a basis of a7arious mystical and erroneous specu lations propounded a kindfof dim adumbratiorl of the heliocentric theory far from deserving any credit for superior sagacity at the hands of modetn scierlee they merit eondemnation for their ex travagant theorizing and 1lnguarded belief In their time what ever evidence there was lay on the side of the then prevalent view that the sun moves round the earth therefore when wlthout addueirlg any eounterevidenee of a seientifie kind they affirmed that the earth moved round the sun they were merely displaying he spirit of what the Yankees eall  pure eussedness   that is to say they were shutting their eyes to the only evidenee whieh was availableX and showing their own obstinaey by propounding a direetly opposite view The sound masim in seienee is that he diseovers who proves and this is a tnaxim whieh many elassieal dseholars wollld do well to remerrlber when writing about the sei entifie speeulations of the early Greeks Now I have made these remarks in order again to emphasize the altnost unique position whieh Aristotle holds among his eon temporaries in this lespeet Instead of giving his faney free rein upon  the high riort road he patiently plods the way of detailed research and when ihe proceeds to generalize he does so as far as possible 1lpon the basis of his inductive experience 1 Lewes however denies that the esldence is sufficient to show that Aris totle knew thi Coming now to his generalizations it was a true philosophieal insight whiehRenabled Aristotle to pereeive in organie nature an aseending eornplexity of organization from the vegetable kingdom up to man Instead of the three kingdoms of Nature whieh were afterwards formulated by the alehemists and whieh in general parlanee we stil eontinue to preserve namely the mineral vege table and animal instead of these three kingdoms Aristotle adopted the mueh more philosophieal elassifieation of Nature into two divisions the organie and the inorganie or the living and the notliving Nevertheless he fell into the errorwhieh was indeed almost unavoidable in his time of supposing that there is a natural and a daily passage of the one into the other IIow ever he again shows his philosophieal insight where he points out the leading distinetions between plants and animals the former manifesting life in the phenomena of nutrition alone ineluding germination growthN repair and reproduetiorl while tile latter besides these exhibit also the phenomena of sensation volition and spontaneous movement He was not so fortunate in his attempts at drawing the boundarylines between plants and ani rnals for while he eorreetly gllessed frotn erroneous observation that sponges should be elassified as animals he deeided in favor of plaeing the hydloid lolyps among the plants and he appears to have classified eertain testaeeous mollusks in the same eate gory Man of eollrse he places at thk head of the anirnal king dom and shows a profound penetration in drawing the true psy ehologieal distinetion between him and the lower animals nanlely that animals only know partieular truths never generalize or form abstraet ideas His concneption of life vbtas more in accordance with that of modern science than that of any of the other conceptions which have been formed of it either in ancient times or thEe middle ages for he seems clearly to have perceived the error of regatding the vital prineiple otherwise than as an abstraction of ollr own rnaking Life and mind in his view were abstractions pertain ing to organistns just in the same way as weight and heat are abstractions pertaining to inanimate objects For convenience of expression or even for purposes of lesearch it may be desirable to speak of weight and heat as independent entities but sse know that they cannot exist apart from material objeets that they are what we term qualities and not themselves objects And so with life and mind they are regarded by Aristotle a8 qualities or as we should now say functions of organisms And here we must remember that the whole course ot previous speculation on sueh matters proceeded on the assumption that the vital principle was an independent entity superadded to organisms serving to animate them as long as it was united to them leaving them to death aand decay as soon as it was svithdrawn from them and even then being itself able to survive as a disembodied spirit en joying its consciou6 existence apart from all material conditions Thus it was that the creations of early thought peopled the world with ghosts and spirits more nurnerously than Nature had sup plied it with living organisms Now Aristotle boldly broke away from this fundamental assumption of the vital principle asXan independent and superadded entity In the phenomena of life aud mindShe saw rnerely the functions of organism he assigned to them both a physical basis and clearly perceived that for any fruitfuI study of either we must have recourse to the methods of physiology The scientific genius which could have enabled a man in those days thus to have anticipated the temper of modern thought ap pears to me entitled to our highest veneratioll Here perhaps more than anywhere else he showed his instinotive t4ppreciation of the objective methods and here it is that the longest time has been taken for mankind to awaken to the truth of his appre ciation In subsequent centuries when European thought drifted away frQm science into theology the question was long and warmly debated whether or not Aristotle believed in the itnmortality of the soul The truth of the matter is that his deliverances upon this question are nzore scarce than clear The following brief passage however appears to show that he regarded the thinking plinciple as distinguished from the animal soul to b6 virtually independent of the corporeal organization  Only the intellectSCIENCE VOL XVII No 422 l32 enters Prom without It alone is godlike Its actuality has noth ing in common with the eorporeal aetuality3 Aristotle appears to have beeno the first philosopher who at all appreciated the importanee of hereditZr as a prineiple not only in natural historys but also in psychology for he distinctlyaffirrns that the ehildren of civilized communities are eapable of a higher degree of intellectual cultivation than are children of savages Among his other more noteworthy enuneiations of general truths we may notice the following  The advantage of physiolbgical division of labor was first set orth says MilneEdu7ards cs by rayself in 1827 Yet Aristotle had said repeatedly that it is preerable when possible to have a separate organ for a separate offlce and that Nature never if she can help it makes one organ answer two purposes as a cheap artist makes 4 spit and eandlestick in one Again that the complexity of life varies with the comple2rity of organization that the structural differences of the alimentaly organs are correlated with differenees of the animals alimentation that no animal without lungs has a voiee and that no animal is endowed with more than one adequate nneans of defenee that there is an inverse relation between the development of horns and of teeth as also between glowth and generation that no dipte rous insect has a sting that the enlbryo is evolsed by a succession of gradllal ehanges from a homogeneous mass into a eomplete organisrr that the development of an organism is a progress from a general to a special formthese and nllmerous others are instances of generalization tnade by Aristotle which have lasted with but slight modifications of his terms to the present day l Of these generalizations the most remarkable is the last which I have nlentioned for one of the greatestand most momentous con troversie3 which the history of science has afforded is that which took place nearly 2000 years after the time of Aristotle with re gard to socalled evolution versus epigenesis The question was whether the germ or egg of any organi3tn contained the 3Cutllre or young organisnz already fortned in miniature and only lequiring to be expanded in order to appear as the perfect organism or whether the process of developmerlt consisted in a progress from the indefinite to the definite frore the simple to the conlples frorn what we call undiSerentiated pl otoplasnl to the fully differ entiated aninal During the seveIateenth arld eighteenth cen turies when this subject was most warmly debated the halance of scientific opinion inclined to what is now known to be the erroneous view that germ is merely the adult organism in miniature It therefore speaks greatly in favor of Aristotles sagacity that he clearly and repeatedly expressed the opinion which is now known to be righti viz that the organism develops out of its germ by a series of differentiations And not only with refer ence to this doctrine of epigenesis but likewise throughout the whole course of his elaborate treatise on generation he displays such wonderful powers both of patient observation and accurate scientific reasoning that this treatise deserves to be regarded as the most renaarkable of all his remarkable works pertaining to biology The sllbjectmatter of it is not however suited to any detailed consideration within the linlits imposed by an article and therefore I will naerely back the general opinion which I have just 43iven by quoting that of the most severe and exacting of all Aristotles critics from the side o sciencesevere and exaoting indeed to a degree which is frequently unjust I mean the late George Eenry Lewes This is what he says of the treatise on generation  It is an extraordinar y production No ancient and few modern works equal it in comprehensiveness of detail and profound specu lative insight We there find some of the obscurest problems of biology treated with a mastery which svhen we consider the con dition of science at that datt is trtlly astonishing I know no better eulogy to pass on Aristotle than to compare his work with the  Exercitations concerning Generation  of our immortal IIar veJ7 The founder of rnodern phf siology was a man of keen in sight of patient research of eminently scientific mind IIis work is superior to that of Aristote in some few anatornioal details but 1 Dr W Ogle ill his admirable work on Aristotle has already alluded to these arld some of the other points previously noticed it is so inferior to it in philosophy that at the present day it is mueh more antiqllated much less aecordant with our views I has e now said enough to cons eJ7 a general idea of the enormous range of Aristotles work within the four corners of biology his anazing instincts of scientific method and his immense power of grasping generalizations While doing this I have selected in stances of his acouracy rather than of his inaccuracy not onlyt because it is in the former that he stands in most conspicuous contrast with all preeeding and with most succeeding philosophers of antiquity but also because it is here that we tnay be most sure of according justice Where we meet with statements of fact which are accurate we alay be satisfied that we are in immediate contact with the nlind Qf Aristotle himself but svhen we meet with inaecurate statements we must not be sosure of this Not only is it probable that in the great majority of these cases he ha been Inisled by erroneous infortnation supplied to him by travel lers fishermen and otl3ers but there is good reason to suppose that in some places his tnanuseripts may hatwe been tampexed with These were hidden underground for the better part of two centuries and when thev  ere eventually brought to lightS Apellicon into svhose hands they fell  felt no seruples in eor recting what had been wormeaten and supplying what was d fective or illegible 1 Thus to quote 91 OgleS who suggests the view here taken 4 I it possible to believe that the same eye that has distinguished the cetacea from the fishes that had detected their hidden rnamtnse discovered their lungsz and recognized the distinct character of their bonesy should have beexl so blind as to fanev that the mouth  of these animals was on the under surface of the body   Al3d so on sa7ith other cases Inaccuracies of observation howevel there must have beent and there must have been inaecuracies of reasoning Iooktog to the enorulous raIlge of his work lin biology alone rernembering that in this work le had had no predecessors consldering that at the same tiale he 7as thus a singlehanded collectol of facts and a singleminded thinkef upon their impolt it becornes evident that Aristotle would have been solalething more than human iti either his observations or his reasnings could everywhere be justly cotnpared with those of scientific genius when more facTora bly circumstanced But it is the glory of Aristotle that both his obsezvations and his reasonirlos can stand such coulpariscun as well as they do for when on the one hard we remember the im mensity of his achievement and on the other hand reflect that he was worse than destitute of any ancestral experience of metilod born into a world of mysticisnz nurtured in the school of Platop therefore compelled himself to forge the intellectual instrunlents of research himself to create the very conceptin of scientific in quirywhen we thus remember and thus reflect it appears tcy rne there can be no question that Aristotle stands forth not only as the greatest figure of antiquitybut as the greatest intellect that has ever appeared upon theface of this earth The overmastering pover with which this intellect swayed the course of subsequent thought was in one respect highly beneficial to the interests of scietlce but in another respect it was no less deleterious It was beneficial in so far as it revealed to mankind the true nlethod of science asobjective and not subjective it was deleteriotls inasmuch as the very magnitude of its force reducedU the intellect of Europe for centuries aftervvards to a condition of abject slavery Nothing is more deleterious to tlle interests of science than undue regard to authority Before all else he spirit of Science must be free it tnust be unfettered by the chains of prejudice whether these be forged by our own elinds or manu factured fol us by the minds of others Her only allegiance is that which she owes to Nature to man she owes nothing and hele as elsewhere it is impossible to serve two masters There fore the only use of allthority in science is to furnish men of less ability with suggestions which as suggestions may properly be considered more worthv of testing by the ob jective methods onu account of their parentage in the mind of genibs But it is an evil day for science wllen such parentage is taken as in itself z sufflcient warrant for the truth of the ideas which have been born of it for then it is that authority is allowed to usurp the place of 1 See Grotes Aristotle i b1MARCH 6 I 89 I  SCIENCE I33 verificatioll Instead of her true motto  Prove all things Sci ence thus adopts its very opposite  Only believe i Now the whole history of Scienee has been more or less blotted by this baleful influence of authority which even in our own days is far from having been svholly expunged But in no part of her history has thls influenee been exerted in any degree at all eomparable with that which was thrown over her like a shadow by Aristotle Partly owing to the magnitude of his genius but still more I think to the predominance of the spirit in the dark ages which regarded submission to authority as an intellectual virtue through all these ages stood to scienee the name of Aris totle in very much the satne relation as stood to religion the name of God His writings on purely scientific subjects were regarded as wellnigh equivalent to a revelation and therefore the sludy of Nature became a mere study of Aristoble There was almost a total absence of any independent inquiry in any one department of science and even in eases where the utterances of Aristotle were obscure the men of intellect who disputed over his lnean ings never thought of appealing to Nature herself for a solution They could only siew Nature through the glasses vvhich had been given them br Aristotleand therefore the only questions with whicll they troubled themselves were those as to the exact mean ing of their oraele It is of course only fair to add that Aristotle himself was in no way responsible for this evil effect of his work The spirit in which his work was thus receixred was quite alien to that in which it had been accomplished and alike by preeept and example he vas himself the most noble opponent of the former that the world has ever produced and thexefore I doubt not that if Aristotle could have been brought back to life during the middle ages he would have made short work of the Aristotelians by himself be eoming their bitterest foe for listen to his voice which upon this as upon so many other matters speaks with the spirit of truest philosophy speaks moreover with the honesty of a gteat and beautiful naturelet us listen to what this master mind bas told us of its own labors and mTith a veneration nlore worthy than that of the Aristotelians let us bow before the man

meeting of the Royal Meteorological Soeiety London o Feb 18 Mr C Harding read a paper entitled  The Great Frost of 189091 This paper dealt with the whole period of the frost from Nov 25 to Jan 23 and it was shown that over ntsarlv the whole of the southeast of England the mean temperature for the fiftynine days was more than 2 below the freezingpoint while at seaside stations on the coast of Kent Sussex7 and Eampshires the mean was only 32 In the extreme north of Scotland as well as in the west of Treland the mean was tOQ warmer than in the sotltheast of England In the southern midlands and in parts of the sollth of England the ruean temperature for the fiftvnine days was tnore than lOQ below the average but in the north of England the deficiency did not amount to 5 and in the extreme north of Scotland it was less than tQ The lowestw authentic reading in the screen was 06 at Stokesay in Shrop shire bllt almost equally low temperatures occurred atcother periods of the frost At tnany places in the south and southwest of England as well as in parts of Scotland and Ireland the great est cold throughout the period occurred at the end of November  and at Waddon in Surrey the thermometer in the screen fell to 1a reading quite unpreeedentedat the close of the autumn At Addington Eills near Croydon the shade thermometer was below the freezingpoint each night with one exception and there were only two exceptions at Cambridge and Reading while in the Shetlands there were ouly nine nights with frost although at Biarritz frost occurred on thirtyone nights and at Rome on six nights At many places in England the frost was continuous night and day for twentyfive days but at coast stations in the north of Scotland it in no case lasted throughout the twentvfour hours On the coast of Sussex the temperature of the sea was 14 warmer than thesair throughout December but on the York shire eoast it was only 6 warmer and in the Shetlands and on parts of the Irish eoast it was only 3 v7armer The Thames water off Deptford at two feet below the surface was eontinu ously below 84 from Dec 23 to Jan 28 a period o thirtytwo days while the river was bloeked with iee during the greater part of this time In Regents Park where skating eontinuect uninterruptedly for fortythree days the iee attained the thick ness of over nine inehes The frost did not penetrate to the depth of two feet below the surfaee of the ground inany part of England but in many place3 espeeially in the south and east the ground was frozen for several days at the depth of one foot and at six inehes it was frozen for upwards o a month In the neighborhood o London the cold was more prolonged than irl any previous frost during the last hundred years the next longest spell being fiftytwo days in the winter of 179S9S whlle in 1838 frost lasted for fifty days and in 178889 for fortynine days

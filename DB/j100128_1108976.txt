might be said to be reserved subject to diminution when Con gress steps in And in one case the State act is spoken of as annulleds But the language generally used indicates that the police power is undi minished though its operation upon subjects of commerce is obstructed On this latter theory State legislation is merely suspended and an act passed during the life of a law of Congress is not void but becomes oper ative when Congress repeals its law The question has not been squarely presented to the Supreme Court but such is the view of the State courts1 And it receives support from the position taken by the Supreme Court with reference to the Wilson Act of I89o in the case of In re Rahrer although that case does not necessarily decide anything further than that Congress may declare that interstate commerce in a certain article ceases when the article reaches the importers handsperhaps on the same prin ciple that it may when reasonable declare an article of doubtful character an unfit subject of commerceand that sales by the importer come within the terms of the general law prohibiting intrastate sales A result similar to that in the New York cases above cited9 has been reached in the case of bankruptcy legislation analogous since the passage of such laws by a State may be regarded as an exercise of its police power under the now accepted definition of the term2 HARDSHIP AS A DEFENSE TO SPECIFIC PERFORMANCEThose cases in which equity uses its discretionary power to refuse specific enforcement of a contract which do not fall under the regular categories of fraud mis take etc are collected by text writers under the general statement that cquity will not specifically enforce a contract that will inflict hardship on the defendant But the cases cited lend only partial support to this proposition for on the one hand some kinds of hardship do not bar relief as for example the defendants insolvency2 or his loss of all benefit from the contract3 and on the other hand many cases of socalled hardship involve no hardship at all in the ordinary sense4 An examination of the cases shows that they really establish the narrower and more definite prin ciple that equity will not enforce an unequal contractone in which the detriment to the defendant is much greater than his benefit The modern rule that inadequacy of consideration i e inequality of market values does not prevent enforcement is only an apparent exception to this principle for since the value of the consideration to the parties depends Per Matthews J in Smith v Alabama supra Sturgis v Stofford

not necessarily coincide with its market value inadequacy of consideration alone is not conclusive of real inequality The cases of socalled hardship show that when in equality is definitely established by supplementing inadequacy of considera tion with evidence that the defendant was for any one of three reasons not in a position to secure an equal return for his promise the contract will not be specifically enforced Such inability to protect his own interest may be due in the first place to the defendants mental inferiority as for example not only his insanity infancy or duress but his weakmindedness8 youth and inexperience drunkenness8 lack of advice in the case of a solitary invalid9 business inex perience in the case of a married woman1 intimate relationship when it prevents due caution which is sometimes even grounds for rescission old age and fear of being dispossessed by the plaintiff2 or recklessness caused by a prevailing fever of speculation13 It may be due in the second place to the fact that the defendants means of knowledge of the subject matter were inferior in important respects to the plaintiffs because of the plaintiffs misrepresentation fraudulent concealment or even his mere fail tire to disclose when under no duty to do so important facts which the defendant had only inferior means of discovering14 It may in the third place be due to events or discoveries unforeseen to either party at the date of the contract which have rendered it unequal The decisions hinging on events subsequent to the contract seem logical if inequality is recognized as the test Since every contract is to a certain extent a speculation and only those events or disclosures destroy its equality which lie entirely out side of the intended speculation the test of equality is therefore whether the contingency was part of the risk reasonably foreseeable by the parties at the time of contracting Thus a contract to rent a mine found to be worthless was enforced because of the frankly speculative nature of mining contracts1 although the same court had four years previously refused to enforce a sale of a manor which was found to include certain valuable lands not regarded by the parties as part of the subject matter7 In the leading American case it was held that an unexpected appreciation in the value of property was but that payment in depreciated paper currency was not part of the vendors risk as contemplated by the parties It was held in a parallel case that depreciation of confederate currency was a risk assumed by the defendant when he contracted to be paid in that medium Specific 6Henderson v Hayes Pa z834 2 Watts 148 157 7Gasque v Small S C 1848 2 Strobh Eq 72 8Cragg v Holme I8II 18 Ves 14 n 3 OCuff v Dorland N Y 1857 50

subject him to criminal prosecution or to liability for damage caused by a great flood On the other hand it was properly held in a recent case Bradley v Hey ward 90o8 164 Fed Io7 in which the defendant resisted enforcement of a contract to sell all the phosphate under her land to the plaintiff on the ground of his discovery of a quantity worth three times the purchase price that since the defendant must have understood the speculative nature of the contract it should be enforced With the exception of cases which are really based on a mistake in reduc ing a verbal contract to writing24 the few cases of hardship which do not involve inequality involve as little real hardship Two of them can be explained but not justified as unprecedented extensions of the doctrine of unclean hands And in most of the others the actual damage to the plaintiff is so slight or merely technical2 as in the case in which the defendant who had contracted to rebuild houses had partly rebuilt and ex tensively repaired them or that in which a railroad had contracted to tunnel its embankment for the benefit of land of small value2 or in which by a change in the character of the district the purpose of a restrictive covenant had become unattainable2 that the court refuses to be bound by the manifest fiction that damages are inadequate and denies specific enforce ment sometimes further justifying its attitude on the ground that specific performance would entail a public loss27 SAVINGS BANK TRUSTS IN NEW YORKThe New York law of savings bank deposits in trust illustrates both a response of the courts to the de mand of business conditions and their reluctance to overrule previous decisions It was held in Martin v Ftunk that a deposit by one person in his own name as trustee for another created a valid trust The question was raised but left unanswered whether surrounding circumstances might not be shown to vary the apparent intention of the depositor Later in discussing that question Andrews J said that the character of such a transaction as creating a trust is not conclusively established by the mere fact of the deposit2 In a case in which a gift of a bank deposit was sought to be established8 he applied this view Attention was called to the com 20Williamson v Dils 1903 1I4 Ky 962 Hope v Walter IL R I9oo i Ch 257 2NVaite v ONeill 1896 72 Fed 348 24Talbot v Ford 1842 3 Sim

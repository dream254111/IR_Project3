journal devoted exclusively to the science of school hygiene The newcomer is now well started in its first year Seven numbers have appeared of the American Journal of School Hygiene published monthly except July and August in Worcester Massachusetts Lawrence Augustus Averill professor of school hygiene in Massachusetts State Normal School assisted by a staff of able contributors is the editor These men have undertaken a task in which others before them have failed because of lack of support It is to be hoped that the educational interests of the United States will make the new venture a success rivaling in excellence the English publication School Hygiene a Review for Educationists and Doctors now in its eighth volume THE SUPERSUPERINTENDENTS OF CHICAGO SCHOOLS Amusing if they were not pathetic are some of the antics performed by the Chicago Board of Education A fair sample of the unintelligent way in which school affairs are being managed is the recent action of the Board appointing what has been called a committee of super superintendents of educational employment Three members of the board are empowered to scrutinize all appointments not under the civil service made by Superintendent Shoop The superintendent endeavor ing to reconstruct his administration has immediate occasion to appoint several educational experts as supervising principals Upon this central force perhaps more than upon any other factor depends the general instructional efficiency of the school system Yet the solid majority Thompson clique of the board proposes to keep its hands on all such appointments The situation is exactly similar to what would occur if the directors of a huge business enterprise should attempt to control the appointing power of an executive officer Not for one day would a capable official tolerate such interference in business Unfortunately even the best school executives are often compelled to compromise with 595596 THE SCHOOL REVIEW their pride If they did not a city like Chicago might never be able to keep a good superintendent more than a fortnight Incidentally an effort is being made by the inside majority to fasten one set of elementary texts on the schools for a period of five years In addition the insiders propose to make one man chairman of a special committee on textbooks responsible for fixing prices This in spite of the fact that the choice of texts is distinctly an educational matter which ought no more to be decided by a board of trustees than the selection of various kinds of tools ought to be left to the trustees of a manufacturing concern If the city of Chicago has an executive school officer whom she can trust let her trust him if not let her hire a new official If the city of Chicago has a school board which apparently cannot or will not trust a good executive let her get a new school board This sounds like simple common sense and decent business management But unfortunately the city has not the power of recall They tell us that the recall has abuses Can these abuses be any worse than the state of affairs in a city which is finally awake to a gross error on the part of her electorate but is powerless until the time for a new election  SCHOOLS AND THE WAR In many different ways schools are conscientiously endeavoring to assume their share of responsibility in the war crisis National leaders of education are vigorously insisting that at the present time enrolment in schools of all grades is both a national duty and a personal advantage Such enrolment is a personal advantage because if the war is protracted the next few years may see a great dearth of men equipped for important professional duties School attendance is a national duty for the same reason the work of the nation must go on under trained leaders These two notes struck first by the National Commissioner of Education are repeated in every corner of the land But the schools are not content merely to lead pupils to look into the distant future They are also endeavoring to teach them that all true Americans young and old have grave obligations in the immediate emergency No data are available to indicate the very large number of highschool boys who have spent all or part of the summer vacation on the farm City boys who last spring did not know the difference between a hay loader and a pitchfork have played their modest part in the national campaign for food Of one group of forty boys from an arisEDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT 597 tocratic neighborhood in Chicago some of them sons of millionaires only three or four failed to hold out and two of these for good reasons From the Newark New Jersey high school ninety boys went to work last spring on farms of these fewer than ten gave up their labor The general majority with health happiness and a sense of responsibility accepted and have completed their stint The public press is filled with instances similar to these from Chicago and Newark The good thus attained in producing food decidedly worth while in itself has been overshadowed perhaps by an incalculable gain in moral fiber that has come to the lads themselves While boys are being taught their opportunities and obligations as food producers the duties of girls as food conservers are not being neg lected Never before have the signs pointed toward such extensive endeavors to develop domestic science in the high schools In Minne apolis for instance foodconservation classes have been crowded all summer in four high schools and seven grade schools This work together with classes in cookery will be continued in the fall Various cities in Indiana are installing special teachers for food conservation and classes in making Red Cross garments and other supplies Detroit is planning for recordbreaking attendance in her nightschool classes in firstaid instruction in economy cooking sewing dress conservation and lectures on food And the cases just cited seem to be typical of what is being done all over the country THE RED CROSS APPEAL Henry P Davidson chairman of the American Red Cross War Council on September I sent to the press a preliminary statement of the work of that organization in Europe During the past year 13000000 has been expended most of it in France and many thousands of workers have been employed The world calamity gives to the Red Cross an opportunity to express the best and most characteristic side of American life and to do it on a scale called for by the immensity of the sorrow and distress of mankind Recently the American people con tributed ioooooooo for the work membership in the organization in the United States now numbers 3621000 over I000000 names having been added in the last month 2400 chapters are active in various sections of the country But the magnitude of the work accomplished and the generous gifts of recent months must not blind us to the fact that the fields for funds598 THE SCHOOL REVIEW and service are unlimited The number of chapters and workers ought to be tripled during 1918 No better field of national usefulness has been opened up to the teachers of the country than the fostering of just this work Every highschool girl in the land ought to have the opportunity of feeling that she is of direct and vital assistance in the great duty of saving and of rebuilding Let a committee of three women teachers in each high school call a meeting of the girls and propound the needs of the hour An active Red Cross chapter in every high school should be our aim The general lines of service undertaken in France alone have been determined after a careful survey of the situation by the Red Cross Commission These purposes are outlined by Mr Davidson as follows I To establish and maintain hospitals for soldiers in the American Army in France 2 To establish and maintain canteens rest houses recreation huts and other means of supplying the American soldiers with such comforts and recreation as the Army authorities may approve 3 To establish and maintain in France canteens rest houses recreation huts and other means of supplying comforts and recreation for the soldiers in the armies of our allies 4 To distribute hospital equipment and supplies of all kinds to military hospitals for soldiers of the American or allied armies 5 To engage in civilian relief including a The care and education of destitute children b Care of mutilated soldiers c Care of sick and disabled soldiers d Relief work in the devastated areas of France and Belgium such as furnishing to inhabitants of these districts agricultural implements household goods foods clothing and such temporary shelter as will enable them to return to their homes e To provide relief for and guard against the increase of tuberculosis 6 To furnish relief for soldiers and civilians held as prisoners by the enemy and to give assistance to such civilians as are returned to France from time to time from the parts of Belgium and of France held by the enemy 7 To supply financial assistance to committees societies or individuals allied with the American Red Cross and carrying on relief work in Europe THE GERMAN LANGUAGE Both sense and nonsense have characterized various attacks upon the German language in the schools If the President of the United States is right we are not warring against the German people we areEDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT 599 not warring against their unrivaled progress in science or their admirable achievements in art and literature all the riches of which are of course embodied in the German language Our warfare is against a vicious brutal and ruthless leadership which is exploiting the genius of the German nation in an endeavor to control the destinies of the world When that militaristic ambition is finally crushed the civilized world must welcome back Germany and the German language In the meantime to withdraw our interests from the language of research and of criticism to withdraw our attention from the tongue of Luther Guten berg Goethe Kant Schiller and Beethoven is the height of pettiness It manifests a lack of humor which the Germans themselves refuse to show To them Shakspere is a worldfigure not an Englishman In short if the study of German is to be abandoned it must be for educa tional or for social reasons and not because of animosities arising out of the war On the other hand there are at least two social considerations which naturally force themselves to the front in these days Never before has the conviction been so prevalent that the United States has as a primary problem the welding together of a heterogeneous mass of widely differing elements The imperative necessity of English as the national tongue does lend strength to the argument of those who main tain that our present system of language instruction is absurd For instance one of the Middle Western cities last year spent iooooo in teaching Englishspeaking children German and almost as much more in teaching Englishspeaking children French while the same city spent only 700 in teaching English to foreignborn residents The foreign language instruction was expended too on a comparatively small number of children Of course it may be replied that the chil dren of the foreignborn are being taught English and that not very many adults can afford the time and strength for evening schools However it does seem somewhat absurd for a city to refuse English instruction to any adult in the community on the ground of expense and at the same time be teaching French and German in the elementary schools It does seem common sense to affirm that if the issue is between appropriations to teach 1oo adults English or ioo grade children French or German the expenditure ought to be decided in favor of the national language There is even less room for doubt concerning a second social con sideration If the retention of a foreign language in American schools tends either directly or indirectly to foster ideas and ideals which are600 THE SCHOOL REVIEW antagonistic to those of the nation such instruction ought to be excluded by state or federal law Difficult though it may be our citizens of German extraction are compelled to choose Germany and the United States are at war American citizens cannot be loyal to both As conservative a paper as the Springfield Republican points out the menace to America of loyalty to a foreign country fostered by a retention of Old World customs ideals and language The past few years have revealed in this country centers of Teutonic feeling which have been more susceptible to German than to American thoughts and influences These alien groups would not in themselves be alarming if the German government had not undertaken to make use of them as political agencies for its own ends Otherwise the German community in the United States would not be regarded with more suspicion than any Scandinavian or Polish community which was somewhat slow in adopting the language and political institutions of the new country which it had selected to make its home The meltingpot has problems that are not to be solved in a day and patience and mutual toleration are the course of wisdom But where assimila tion has been retarded by political agents of another nation who have so played upon natural sentiments that loyalty to the native land has not gradually been superseded by loyalty to the adopted country the school authorities are derelict in their obligation to the state if they do not see that Americanizing influences are predominant in the school DRAFTING MEDICAL STUDENTS The Journal of the American Medical Association has made a careful study of the effect the draft promises to have upon our supply of physi cians and surgeons The Journal points out what utter folly it will be for the United States to repeat the error of France and England in send ing a large proportion of their medical students to the trenches In both countries civil hospitals at once felt the lack of adequate interne service and the supply of army surgeons for the later years of the war has been seriously diminished Unless our War Department very soon renders a definite decision to the effect that medical students can serve best by completing their course we shall repeat the mistake of France and England The Journal communicated with the 13764 medical students enrolled last year Of these 5909 have already replied to the questionnaire 5053 have been drafted 29 per cent in the first call 19 per cent in the second and 51 per cent in later calls The medical schools will be seriously depleted To be remembered also is the fact that many young men are also called to the colors who in normal times would enrol in the FreshmanEDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT 6oi class A man is a man whether he be scholar poet musician or me chanic But in war time a man is more than a man if he be a physician or surgeon or on the road to becoming one NATIONAL CHILD LABOR LAW ON TRIAL The Federal Child Labor law establishing fourteen years as the minimum under which a child may be employed went into effect on September i The working day of no child under sixteen shall exceed eight hours and he may not be employed between 700 PM and 6oo AM These provisions are to be enforced by excluding from interstate commerce the products of any factory mill workshop or cannery which violates them Already the law has been held unconstitutional by a federal court of North Carolina The trial case was brought in the name of one Dagen hart a povertystricken mill hand claiming a legal right to the earning power of two sons The federal judge held the law unconstitutional on exactly that principle namely the property right of a parent in the services of his minor children In other words the statute deprives a citizen of property without due process of law One additional point was made by the court to the effect that the law is an attempt by Con gress to control manufacture within the states by the use of its power over interstate commerce thus attempting to do indirectly what it can not do directly Appeal will be taken to the Supreme Court and in the meantime the law goes into effect everywhere except in the federal district in which the decision of the lower court holds temporarily Government attorneys do not fear the second principle enunciated by the judge because they feel that identically this issue has been settled in the lottery cases and in the Mann White Slave law both of which have been held constitutional The other issue is more serious and points not only at a technical legal consideration but also directly at the social issue involved to what extent can society afford to allow its children to become wholly or in part the support of indigent parents It may be remarked parenthetically that the brilliant array of legal talent sup porting the case of the Dagenharts indicates that the Southern Cotton Manufacturers Association is interested in the Federal Child Labor law exactly as the National Manufacturers Association has been interested in the laws of the minimum wage and hours of labor for women Thus I Since this was written medical students have been temporarily exempted602 THE SCHOOL REVIEW once more the fight is on between business and life between what is constitutional and what ought to be constitutional COMMISSIONER KENDALLS CALL As an example of the ringing calls to service which school leaders are sending to their subordinates in the ranks the School Review reprints a recent letter of Commissioner Kendall of New Jersey To Teachers and School Officials The present is a time which makes new demands upon all men and women Teachers and school officials are no exception There is a new urgency But the processes of education must go on modified only as conditions demand The causes of the war are set forth in the Presidents Message to Congress This message is a lofty statement of the American position Pupils in the high schools and the older elementary pupils should be familiar with it No effort should be spared to make our pupils understand why we have entered the warnot for hate not for conquest not for military glorybut for human rights for the common welfare and for the perpetuation of real democracy The later statement of the Presidenta message to the people pleading for the use of all our energies and for wise economyis a document which should certainly afford material for discussion for the guidance of old and young alike The attention of pupils may appropriately be called to the ways in which they can respond by preventing waste in the use of school supplies by the conserva tion of food and by the avoidance of needless expenditures Excitement and nervous tension are an accompaniment of war affecting old and young alike To these our youth are peculiarly susceptible These are likely to hinder the work of the schools and interfere with customary orderly behavior The teacher will not seek to arouse these emotions he will seek to allay them This is not easy Patriotic enthusiasm for the country and its ideals is however one of the most beautiful expressions of boys and girls A little boy once said that he had three fathersGod his father and Uncle Sam An appreciation of our country the opportunities it gives the blessings it confersthese should be taught Obligation to serve it our debt to it our responsibility for itthese too should be taught Nor should this teaching be confined to children Patriotism is not a negative virtue it means service it means selfdenial As such it should be positively taught in schools Says Emerson He is baseand that is the one base thing in the universeto receive favors and render none The loyalty of teachers to the United States should be without suspicion Teachers are public officials If they cannot support the government heartily they should resign The war presents a unique opportunity to demonstrate the value of the industrial activities of the schools If these activities are useful now in theEDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT 603 present emergency their place in public esteem will be further assured The resources of agricultural activities of home gardens of the school kitchen the sewing room manual and vocational shops all should be used for aiding the war so far as circumstances permit As a force for patriotic service they become vitalized as the men and women in charge make them vital Every teacher however has a peculiar duty and obligation to the State and to the children at this time That duty or obligation is to do his work well in the ordinary routine of the school The value of the schools even in time of war is not confined to shops and gardens To teach a better school than he has ever taught is a patriotic obligation of the teacher The children we teach are the men and women of ten and twenty years from now They must be made intellectually strong morally strong physically strong as well as industrially strong These children will as men and women have difficult problems to meet some of them the outgrowth of this war On those men and women will rest decisions of vital interest to society Upon them will fall some of the burden of the cost of the war That teacher or principal or superintendent who does not feel at this time renewed consecration to his work is to be pitied The children in all our schoolsfrom the kindergarten through the high school must be well taught in these times Preparedness then is the occupation of the teacher as an official of the State The school is the organized instrument set up and supported by the public in the confident assurance that teachers will make it an effective instrument of this preparedness The public will not be disappointed here for the loyalty and the faithfulness of American teachers will be equal to the trust The prevalent interest in the war should be capitalized for instruction The life institutions and resources of our allies as well as of those countries with which we are at war offer material for discussion Our geography may be made more useful The teacher should use wall maps for class discussion of important events as they occur Newspapersdaily and weeklywere never more interesting than at present History is now in the makingnot military history alone but history that is political and economicand with this our pupils should become acquainted The significance of the democratic movements abroad in the world should be taught to children of appropriate age Here is an opportunity to teach a useful kind of civics This too is a good time to make provision in the high schools for needed instruction in the elements of political and social science a kind of instruction which should be more common in those schools if our young people are to play their part in government and society usefully and intelligently The enactment at the recent session of the Legislature of a law providing for universal physical training in the schools of the State was exceedingly oppor tune Two and a half hours a week are to be used for this purpose beginning with the new school year next September A course of study or of exercises is now being prepared and will be ready at that time This is essentially a health measurea preparedness measure If the course is well planned and well taught it will do much to make the future men604 THE SCHOOL REVIEW and women of New Jersey physically strong and healthy It ought to be worth to the State far more than it costs Let us make it so Of course no board of education will ignore the law in regard to the display of the flag No teacher will omit the flag salute nor the pledge of loyalty nor will he neglect to invest this ceremony with the proper degree of dignity and solemnity He will have the children sing our national songs he will see that they know these songs by heartand really by heartand he will teach them to stand reverently while singing them No thoughtful teacher will neglect to teach the older pupils the immortal words of Lincolns Gettysburg Address and of his second Inaugural Address or such beautiful and inspiring words as those in the closing lines of Lowells noble Commemoration Ode and in the last stanza of Longfellows Building of the Ship To these might be added Julia Ward Howes Battle Hymn of the Republic  and Kiplings  Recessional The spirit expressed in another of Kiplings poems might well be applied to America There shall be one peopleit shall serve one Lord Neither Priest nor Baron shall escape It shall have one speech and law soul and strength and sword Englands being hammered hammered hammered into shape Perhaps the most important of allour program for the education of all the children and youth of the State between five and eighteen so splendidly enunciated in the constitution of New Jersey must go on It would be a great mistake for boards of education administrative officials or teachers to allow our schoolsthe organized instrument for the promotion of intelligent democracy one of the purposes for which the war is foughtto become less efficient Indeed they should be made more useful in times like the present There should be no halting in keeping the standards of the schools high Of course there must be no waste There must be watchfulness but undue economy in effort or money is a shortsighted policy in the preparation of hundreds of thousands of children and youth for the life before them Our educational processes must go on The war already has cost our allies as well as the countries with which we are at war great numbers of men It may so develop that we may lose many of our own men So much the more necessary is it that the youth in our schools should be so trained that every individual who is left is made more fit as a citizen and more productive as a worker It may be necessary as a result of the war to establish schools later for the maimed and crippled here in New Jersey It is said that England in this crisis made the mistake of allowing her schools to become impaired France evidently has done better for if informa tion be correct the activities of French schools have not been materially curtailed even during the throes of the great conflict in which that nation has been engagedEDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT 6o05 In our national service in peace or in war the servantwho is also the master in a democracymust be educated must be trained must be intelli gent Such

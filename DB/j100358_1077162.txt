J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1077162,A SUGGESTED INTRODUCTORY COURSE IN ENGLISH LITERATURE,I244618,A SUGGESTED INTRODUCTORY COURSE IN ENGLISH LITERATURE JAMES P MUNROE BOSTON MASS SO TO TEACH ENGLISH LITERATURE THAT THE PUPIL MAY BE STIMU LATED TO THE READING OF GOOD BOOKS IS ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT AS IT IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEMS IN SECONDARY EDUCA TION MOST TEACHERS HAVE AT LAST DISCARDED THE COMPENDIUM AND THE EPITOME MERE LITERARY CELLULOSE SQUEEZED DRY OF ALL SUBSTANCE AND NUTRIMENT BUT UNFORTUNATELY THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTITUTED FOR THEM TOO OFTEN NOTHING BUT SCRAPS OF INDIGESTIBLE CRITICISM THE NEW WAY IS EVEN MORE FUTILE THAN THE OLD AND IF THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE TO FACTS AT SECOND HAND IS TO BE THEORIES AND OPINIONS AT SECOND HAND LET US BY ALL MEANS CHOOSE THE LESSER EVIL BY CLINGING TO THE OLD COMPENDIUM THE AVERAGE PUPIL WILL BE AS LITTLE INTERESTED IN CRITICAL POTTERING AS IN BIO GRAPHICAL TWADDLE AND NEITHER LEADS TO A LOVE OF LITERATURE THE COMPENDIUM METHOD AND THE SOCALLED CRITICAL METHOD OF TEACHING LITERATURE FAIL OF THE DESIRED END BECAUSE THEY ISOLATE THE SUBJECT WITH WHICH THEY DEAL AND IDENTIFY BOOKS WITH NOTHING UNDER THE SUN EXCEPTING THE INDIVIDUALS WHO PRODUCED THEM WHEREAS THE BOOKWRITER IS OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE IN COMPARISON WITH HIS BOOKS AND BOOKS SHOULD BE STUDIED NOT AS ISOLATED CREA TIONS BUT AS LANDMARKS AND WAYSIGNS OF THE TIME IN WHICH THEY WERE WRITTEN LITERATURE IS THE FLOWER OF HISTORY BUT TO KNOW TO APPRECIATE TO LOVE THIS BLOSSOMING ONE MUST KNOW THE PLANT FROM WHICH IT SPRANG TO DRAG A PUPIL THEREFORE WHO KNOWS NOT ENGLISH SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC HISTORY BACK TO BEOWULF AND TO PUSH HIM THENCE THROUGH THE TO HIM MEANINGLESS WASTES OF EARLY ENGLISH LITERATURE IS WE NOW UNDERSTAND A PROCESS AS USE LESS AS IT IS DISTRESSING WE DO NOT PERCEIVE SO CLEARLY PERHAPS THAT THE REVERSED PROCESS BY WHICH HE IS PUSHED BACKWARD FROM MODERN CRITICISM TO SAXON OR NORMAN OR RENAISSANCE BEGIN 542COURSE IN ENGLISH LITERATURE NINGS IS SCARCELY MORE EFFECTIVE AND IS EVEN LESS LOGICAL WHILE THE FIRST TASK REQUIRES OF THE PUPIL LITTLE FOR THE PASSING OF EXAMINATIONS EXCEPT POWERS OF MEMORY AND AN ABILITY TO KEEP AWAKE THE SECOND PRESUPPOSES A HISTORICAL INSIGHT RARE EVEN AMONG COLLEGIANS A CRITICAL SENSE THAT COMES ONLY WITH MATURITY AND A GRASP OF STYLE THAT MUST WAIT UPON SLOW CULTIVATION TWO THINGS ARE NECESSARY TO INTEREST AN AVERAGE PUPIL IN ANY SUBJECT THE COURSE OF STUDY MUST BE BASED UPON WHAT HE ALREADY KNOWS AND IT MUST BE PUT INTO RELATIONSHIP WITH SUBJECTS WHICH AROUSE HIM THE ONLY STUDY DIRECTLY RELATED TO LITERATURE WITH WHICH THE ORDINARY PUPIL WHO ENTERS THE HIGH SCHOOL IS FAMILIAR IS AMERICAN HISTORY THE ONY TOPICS WHICH AS A RULE ENGAGE HIS INTEREST ARE THE EVENTS OF THE DAY UPON THESE SLIGHT AND RATHER INCONVENIENT MENTAL PEGS THEREFORE WE MUST HANG HIS STUDY OF ENGLISH LITERATURE WE MUST BEGIN THIS SUBJECTWHOSE RIGHT BEGINNING IS SO DIFFICULT AND SO ESSENTIALBY TRACING THE GROWTH OF LITERATURE IN THE UNITED STATES BY SHOWING THE PARALLEL ISM OF THAT GROWTH TO OUR POLITICAL AND SOCIAL PROGRESS AND BY MAKING PLAIN HOW LARGE A FACTOR LITERATURE HAS BEEN AND ALWAYS WILL BE IN HUMAN HISTORY IN SO DOING I BELIEVE SUCH AN APPRECIA TION OF GOOD BOOKS AND SUCH A LOVE FOR THEIR STUDY WILL BE AROUSED IN MOST PUPILS THAT THEY WILL BE READY FOR AN INTELLIGENT AND RECEPTIVE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE LARGER LITERATURE OF GREAT BRITAIN THE FOLLOWING OUTLINE OF WORK BASED UPON THE USE OF AMERI CAN AS THE FIRST STEP IN ENGLISH LITERATURE IS OF NECESSITY NOT ONLY TENTATIVE BUT CRUDE IT MUST IN ACTUAL PRACTICE BE GREATLY MODI FIED IT MUST UNDER ALL CONDITIONS BE FLEXIBLE ITS GENERAL DRIFT SHOULD BE ADAPTED TO THE PREVAILING TEMPER OF EACH CLASS AND IT SHOULD BE SUBDIVIDED AND INDIVIDUALIZED TO MEET THE TASTES AND APTITUDES OF SINGLE PUPILS THE TEACHER MUST BE ENTHUSIASTIC MUST HAVE THE HISTORICAL AS WELL AS THE CRITICAL SENSE FULLY DEVEL OPED MUST POSSESS THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL NECESSARY TO A GRAPHIC SUMMINGUP OF BOOKS INDEED THE SUCCESS OF THIS COURSE OF INSTRUCTION IS PECULIARLY DEPERNDENT UPON THE PERSONALITY OF THE INSTRUCTOR ITS VALUE RESTS TOO UPON THE THOROUGHNESS AND SANENESS OF THE TEACHING IN UNITED STATES HISTORY WHICH HAS BEEN 543THE SCHOOL REVIEW GIVEN IN THE GRAMMAR SCHOOLS IT IS ESSENTIAL TO BE MORE EX PLICIT THAT THIS INSTRUCTION SHALL HAVE DEALT WITH THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC RATHER THAN WITH THE MILITARY AND DIPLOMATIC EVENTS OF OUR HISTORY THAT IT SHALL HAVE CONSIDERED IMPULSES AND MEASURES RATHER THAN WARS AND MEN A PUPIL PROPERLY TAUGHT IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES OUGHT TO KNOW UPON ENTERING THE HIGH SCHOOL THE CAUSES AS WELL AS THE DETAILS OF OUR INDUSTRIAL AND POLITICAL GROWTH THE FOUNDATION AS WELL AS THE FACT OF OUR DEMOC RACY THE EVOLUTION AS WELL AS THE CHRONOLOGY OF OUR NATIONAL PROGRESS A PUPIL SO PREPARED SHOULD BE ABLE TO COVER EASILY IN TWO YEARS A COURSE IN AMERICAN LITERATURE BASED UPON THE FOLLOWING SKELETON OF WORK WHICH FOR THE SAKE OF SIMPLICITY IS PUT IN MAN DATORY FORM THIS SCHEME PRESUPPOSES THAT ONLY FEW BOOKS OR PARTS OF BOOKS WILL BE READ IN CLASS THAT BIOGRAPHICAL DETAILS WILL BE STUDIED ONLY SO FAR AS THEY MARKEDLY INFLUENCED AN AUTHORS WORK THAT CONDENSATION OF THOUGHT OF SPEECH OF WRITING ARE TO BE DEVELOPED AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE IN THE PUPIL THAT ALL HIS READING OUT OF SCHOOL IS TO BE IN THE LINE OF HIS CLASSWORK AND THAT A GOOD PUBLIC OR SCHOOL LIBRARY IS READILY ACCESSIBLE EXAMINE THE PUPILS INDIVIDUALLY TO ASCERTAIN IF EVERY ONE OF THEM HAS FIRMLY IN MIND AN

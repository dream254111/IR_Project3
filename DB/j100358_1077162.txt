j100358,The School Review,1077162,A Suggested Introductory Course in English Literature,i244618,A SUGGESTED INTRODUCTORY COURSE IN ENGLISH LITERATURE JAMES P MUNROE Boston Mass So to teach English literature that the pupil may be stimu lated to the reading of good books is one of the most difficult as it is one of the most important problems in secondary educa tion Most teachers have at last discarded the compendium and the epitome mere literary cellulose squeezed dry of all substance and nutriment but unfortunately there has been substituted for them too often nothing but scraps of indigestible criticism The new way is even more futile than the old and if the only alternative to facts at second hand is to be theories and opinions at second hand let us by all means choose the lesser evil by clinging to the old compendium The average pupil will be as little interested in critical pottering as in bio graphical twaddle and neither leads to a love of literature The compendium method and the socalled critical method of teaching literature fail of the desired end because they isolate the subject with which they deal and identify books with nothing under the sun excepting the individuals who produced them Whereas the bookwriter is of little consequence in comparison with his books and books should be studied not as isolated crea tions but as landmarks and waysigns of the time in which they were written Literature is the flower of history but to know to appreciate to love this blossoming one must know the plant from which it sprang To drag a pupil therefore who knows not English social and economic history back to Beowulf and to push him thence through the to him meaningless wastes of early English literature is we now understand a process as use less as it is distressing We do not perceive so clearly perhaps that the reversed process by which he is pushed backward from modern criticism to Saxon or Norman or Renaissance begin 542COURSE IN ENGLISH LITERATURE nings is scarcely more effective and is even less logical While the first task requires of the pupil little for the passing of examinations except powers of memory and an ability to keep awake the second presupposes a historical insight rare even among collegians a critical sense that comes only with maturity and a grasp of style that must wait upon slow cultivation Two things are necessary to interest an average pupil in any subject the course of study must be based upon what he already knows and it must be put into relationship with subjects which arouse him The only study directly related to literature with which the ordinary pupil who enters the high school is familiar is American history the ony topics which as a rule engage his interest are the events of the day Upon these slight and rather inconvenient mental pegs therefore we must hang his study of English literature We must begin this subjectwhose right beginning is so difficult and so essentialby tracing the growth of literature in the United States by showing the parallel ism of that growth to our political and social progress and by making plain how large a factor literature has been and always will be in human history In so doing I believe such an apprecia tion of good books and such a love for their study will be aroused in most pupils that they will be ready for an intelligent and receptive acquaintance with the larger literature of Great Britain The following outline of work based upon the use of Ameri can as the first step in English literature is of necessity not only tentative but crude It must in actual practice be greatly modi fied it must under all conditions be flexible Its general drift should be adapted to the prevailing temper of each class and it should be subdivided and individualized to meet the tastes and aptitudes of single pupils The teacher must be enthusiastic must have the historical as well as the critical sense fully devel oped must possess the knowledge and skill necessary to a graphic summingup of books Indeed the success of this course of instruction is peculiarly deperndent upon the personality of the instructor Its value rests too upon the thoroughness and saneness of the teaching in United States history which has been 543THE SCHOOL REVIEW given in the grammar schools It is essential to be more ex plicit that this instruction shall have dealt with the social and economic rather than with the military and diplomatic events of our history that it shall have considered impulses and measures rather than wars and men A pupil properly taught in the history of the United States ought to know upon entering the high school the causes as well as the details of our industrial and political growth the foundation as well as the fact of our democ racy the evolution as well as the chronology of our national progress A pupil so prepared should be able to cover easily in two years a course in American literature based upon the following skeleton of work which for the sake of simplicity is put in man datory form This scheme presupposes that only few books or parts of books will be read in class that biographical details will be studied only so far as they markedly influenced an authors work that condensation of thought of speech of writing are to be developed as rapidly as possible in the pupil that all his reading out of school is to be in the line of his classwork and that a good public or school library is readily accessible Examine the pupils individually to ascertain if every one of them has firmly in mind an outline of the growth of the United States If not review the subject pointing out the salient phases of national progress Make sure that the students have a mental picture of the social conditions of the Colonies that they appreciate the period of comparative mental degeneracy which intervened between roughly speaking I675 and I750 and that they understand the causes of the Revolutionary War Calling attention to the early founding of colleges and schools show why the Colonial literature was necessarily either theological or narrative Read extracts from Edwards from the Magnalia from Winthrops Journal Interest some of the pupils if possible in a study outside the classroom of the Colonial chronicles Give practice in the writing of narrative Read in class rapidly portions of Franklins Autobiography Sketch the rise of political literature and its close adherence to the forms of theological writing Study the beginnings of the 544COURSE IN ENGLISH LITERATURE newspaper comparing the News Letter or the Centinel with the modern dailies Call attention to the flood of pamphlets and show their relationship to the modem periodical Read in class certain of the simpler Federalist papers and arouse individual interest if possible in the literature of the Constitution Show the use of invective exaggeration and other rhetorical qualities peculiar to debate Encourage the impartial discussion of po litical questions avoiding mere wordy fencing Make clear the reasons for the modem decay of letterwriting emphasizing the importance of a good epistolary style Read certain letters of Washingtons of Jeffersons and from the Diplomatic Correspondence Give careful practice in letter writing Trace the growth of oratory Show the necessities that called it into being and its connection with the pamphlet Study some of the orations of Henry Webster Everett and Sumner Compare to some extent their methods of persua sion Give practice in abstracting by requiring pupils to con dense a familiar oration also in expansion by making them develop an oration from a simple list of facts Show the rise of an enduring American literature with the advent of the native romance Demonstrate the influence of environment by contrasting Irving and Cooper with Hawthorne Show that the strength and originality of these authors came from their use of native material Read in class portions of the Sketch Book and of the House of the Seven Gables Urge the reading out of school of the Leatherstocking Tales and of those romances by Hawthorne that are based upon American life Trace as far as possible the rise of transcendentalism out of the peculiar conditions in New England its expression in Brook Farm Blithedale Romance and its best fruitage in Emerson Read in class portions of the Conduct of Life and try to arouse an interest in similar essays Contrast the social teaching of Emerson with the individualism of Thoreau if the class be competent to grasp it Explain that the conditions in the United States the engraft ing of an old civilization upon a rich new country could scarcely 545THE SCHOOL REVIEW fail to produce such a group of nature poets as we possess Study Bryant Longfellow and Whittier Read shorter poems of each and make obligatory if possible the reading outside of Ezvangeline Hiawatha and Legends of New England Discuss broadly poetic forms and the reasons for poetry Endeavor to interest the pupils in this but do not drive them to it Demonstrate the influence of the transcendentalists and poets upon the antislavery agitation Read in class portions of the Biglow Papers and some of Whittiers antislavery hymns Show the importance at this crisis of our fondness for oratory Read one or more speeches of Garrison and Phillips Explain the in fluence of Uncle Toms Cabin emphasizing the point that the value of a book may come from its opportuneness quite as much as from its intrinsic merit Deal with the historians Bancroft Hildreth Palfrey Prescott Motley Parkman as fully as time and the temper of the class warrant If a critical reading of them or of some of them out of school can be brought about the main object will be attained Warn the pupils against rhetorical narrative and teach them if possible how to sift facts from theories in his torical reading Explain why with the close of the Civil War a new era in our literature began Show that it is now in a transition state toward cosmopolitanism Show the influence of our peculiar humor studying especially Holmes Bret Harte and Mark Twain as types Trace as far as may be the effect on the one hand of our journalistic spirit on the other of our fondness for selfanalysis Touch lightly upon current writers and emphasize the necessity of perspective in the forming of correct judgments Guide the pupils outside reading in the books of today Help him to discriminate between the permanent and the ephemeral Such a course as has been outlined cannot fail when devel oped by a good teacher possessing literary insight to reach in some measure all those pupils in whom it is possible to arouse any interest Many boys and girls are wholly lacking in the comprehension of books and upon such the teachers time is thrown away They ought to be dropped from the course in 546COURSE IN ENGLISH LITERATURE 547 literature if not indeed from the high school itself No method could be devised by which their eyes would be unsealed To the majority of pupils however this introductory course may well serve for that allimportant first step which rightly taken makes later steps easy and increasingly delightful Only when boys and girls young men and women shall understand that literature is an important factor in civilization only when they shall learn to distinguish good thoughts from poor thoughts solid writing from tawdry writing will the swelling tide of bad books be stayed Were our secondary schools to find some way of teach ing literature so that it would penetrate and permeate the pupils life such a social leaven would be set at work that we should no longer have cause to sigh for real culture to apologize for the newspapers and to blush at the contents of the

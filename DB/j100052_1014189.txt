j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1014189,Labors Attitude toward Methods of Management,i242680,Labors Attitude Toward Methods of Management By JOHN P FREY Editor International Molders Journal THERE is one subject upon which little difference of opinion exists today The world stands in urgent need of greater production States men economists manufacturers finan ciers and tradeunionists are all agreed that the enormous waste caused by the war and the crushing burden of na tional indebtedness which followed can only be overcome by production the creation of sufficient wealth to liquidate the debts of the world and to give greater comforts and opportunities to the mass of the people than they have enjoyed before MANAGEMENT AND LABOR IN PRO DUCTION In its broadest aspect production depends upon several factors which include in their number demand credit raw material labor and transpor tation For the present purpose the problem is being considered solely in the field of management and labor Here we find that while there is una nimity of opinion as to the necessity for better production there is but little agreement upon the methods which must be adopted to develop the greatest degree of production with the greatest benefit to industry and the community It is not a particularly difficult task to state the formula for production The problem lies in applying it in a practical manner The basis for suc cessful production is co6peration be tween management and labor and successful co6peration is based upon confidence between those who are to cooperate But how is this confidence to be established Successful production requires that there shall be method system and discipline With this conception there will be no valid objection The vital question which arises is the authority which is to select and determine upon the method or system and apply or supervise the discipline If management is to assume the sole right to determine what system is to be applied to secure better produc tion and what rules regulations and discipline are necessary to make it effective no profound knowledge of human nature is required to realize that labor under such circumstances cannot give its fullest co6peration Systems and rules for production can only work successfully where there is co6peration and the right mental attitude and these cannot be created unless those who are to participate jointly in production jointly agree upon the conditions under which it will be carried on Is it possible to establish a condition where confidence will exist between management and labor unless these two important parties to production have become acquainted with each other and with the problems which affect both and in addition have jointly worked out the rules and regula tions under which cooperation is to be carried on Industry in America has not been carried on as economically and as effectively as it might have been one prominent reason being the lack of confidence which has existed on the part of management toward labor and on the part of labor toward manage 140LABOR AND MANAGEMENT ment Management at times has apparently believed that satisfactory production depended wholly upon rules methods and systems worked out and applied by management alone Labor has been made to feel on more than one occasion that its sole function was to obey orders and fre quently to obey them blindly and where this condition has existed it has unquestionably created an attitude on the workers part where they had but little interest in production and none of the spirit of cooperation which is so essential For a number of years previous to the war able men animated by most worthy motives endeavored to devise methods and systems which if applied to industry would establish greater production But these systems re gardless of their individual merits largely failed to solve the problem Under their operation labor as a whole became more dissatisfied and less willing to cooperate Production was something which was forced instead of something which came as a result of good will and a spirit of confidence and cooperation The American tradeunion move ment believes in progress It is the only hope for the future It recognizes that progress means change and read justment and it has no objection to changes but American labor may have serious objections to the method by which changes are made Labor has objected in the past and will object in the future whenever it believes that it is being experimented upon and experimented with by others without having a voice as to the necessity the value or the character of the experiments taking place during a period of change Labor feels fully justified in this position for from the mass of industrial experiments in which the human factor plays a promi nent part we find that the majority have resulted in failure It must be recognized that there is a distinct dif ference between experiments with ma terial and experiments with human beings If labor has realized that production was necessary to the creation of wealth and wealth was necessary if higher wages and other improved terms of employment were to be secured why is it that labor frequently indicated a frank unwillingness to cooperate with management when new methods or systems of production were applied LABORS ATTITUDE TOWARD PRODUC TION SYSTEMS One prominent reason for labors position is not difficult to discover Labor was suspicious of these systems suspicious because it had not been consulted and had had no part in preparing them suspicious because they were unfortunately frequently advertised as methods by which skilled labor could be supplanted by unskilled labor suspicious because it was claimed that scientific methods had been worked out which enabled manage ment and management solely to determine what degree of exertion what amount of production labor should produce within a given time suspicious because in practice these systems were largely applied by men having little if any practical personal experience as manual or skilled work men suspicious because the mathe matician and the mechanical engineer were held to be the only ones compe tent to determine the methods pro cesses and the amount of energy which the workman should put into the days work Facts are facts and no good can come from sidestepping them or gloss ing them over Labor before the war rose in 141THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY opposition to the several systems of production which had been loosely called scientific management As labor was directly affected it was interested in time studies in the sub division of labor and the basis of com putation for the payment of wages For a number of years there existed an active controversy between those who advocated socalled scientific manage ment and the tradeunionists As a result of an investigation made under the authority of the Industrial Rela tions Commission it was made evi dent that the term scientific manage ment applied to these systems was an unfortunate one because none of them had reached that stage where the term scientific was appropriate The internal evidence contained in the investigating commissions report satisfactorily disposed of the con tention that time studies of labor could be made with scientific accuracy they disclosed that the human element was a factor which could not be reduced to scientific accuracy by the use of the stopwatch or any other methods for men differ in their mentality their vi tality their nervous reaction the time required to recover from fatigue as well as in a number of other qualities Sometime after the report on scien tific management and labor above re ferred to had been published one of the production engineers in the scien tific management group in a commu nication to the writer said in sub stance I will admit that you have proved the unscientific character of much that has been termed scientific management and that no one can suc cessfully claim today that time studies of labor can be made which are scien tifically acurate You have killed these claims and you may kill others but the soul of efficiency cannot be killed Certain fundamental truths which were worked out by efficiency engineers will live regardless of how incumbered they may have been by false claims and by the pretentions of those who saw in the new conceptions of production an op portunity of exploitation for personal ends An unprejudiced examination of what has been done by the efficiency or production engineers bears out the basic truth contained in the statement that the soul of efficiency cannot be killed Unquestionably there was much in scientific management which was sound for if labor could be charged with inefficiency at times in many in stances management in American in dustries could be charged with a much greater volume as well as the burden of responsibility In fact those who have studied the methods or lack of methods of management which existed a number of years ago are frequently surprised that it was possible to have kept the sheriff from the door under the cumbersome inadequate and unin telligent system of production which existed in many plants In company with Professor Robert F Hoxie and Mr Robert G Valentine the other members of the commission the writer investigated a large eastern manufacturing plant A scientific management engineer had installed his system in the plant after some two years work and a cost to the firm of approximately 40000 The installer of the system had been more compe tent as a mathematician and a mechan ical engineer than as a psychologist or economist he had apparently known little about human nature Owing to the fatal defects which had developed in the system which he had installed it had been eliminated from the plant root and branch However the presi dent of the corporation stated that it was the most profitable 40000 he had ever spent because it had given him an opportunity of studying production 142LABOR AND MANAGEMENT in his plant from a viewpoint which he had never grasped before and had en abled him to install methods of pro duction far more satisfactory and suc cessful than those he had originally worked out DIFFICULTIES OF PRODUCTION SYSTEMS For a period before the war there was little in the direction of produc tion in many plants which brought the higher management into direct contact with labor Wasteful methods with which the workmen were familiar were not called to the managements atten tion because the management believed that it was fully equipped and all sufficient to direct production and there was to quite an extent the same measure of co6peration between management and labor which existed between the Czar of Russia and many of his subjectsthere was compul sory regulation in the place of a spirit of loyalty and co6peration When systems for the regulation and stimulation of production were first applied too much confidence appar ently was placed in the system and not enough consideration given to the human factors which were involved and the systems were frequently ac companied by the promise the under standing or the belief that their intro duction and application would prevent labor troubles and establish a condition under which tradeunionism could not function successfully If a system applied in one plant could be shown by charts and statis tics to have accomplished remarkable results in increasing production and reducing labor costs this in itself was ito proof that when applied in other plants it would produce similar results Methods of soil cultivation on the rich plains of the central west would not work efficiently on the rocky uneven but fertile soil of the New England states Methods of directing coolie labor in Asia no matter how successful there in all likelihood could not be sat isfactorily applied in America to Amer can workmen Among those who a few years ago were endeavoring to work out the problem were engineers who saw the problem almost wholly from the posi tion which they occupied and who had failed to sufficiently examine or under stand it from the view point of those occupying different positions Some with the stark enthusiasm of theorists devised methods and systems which they applied with as much fervor as crusaders but with as little sound judgment as the hydropaths who find ing that certain applications of humid ity or water to the human body pro duced beneficial results in certain cases conceived the idea that all of the ills to which the human flesh is heir could be speedily cured by wet packs The facts are more valuable than illustrations or theories The out standing fact is that the various sys tems of production so widely adver tised and discussed a few years ago failed to bring about that quality and quantity of production which should be the ideal of both management and labor They failed to establish mutual confidence and because of this failed to create a condition of healthful co operation between management and labor While some efficiency engineers were claiming that highly skilled labor was no longer required because through systems of production and subdivision of the work it was no longer necessary to employ the oldfashioned crafts man other men believed that one of the handicaps to successful production was the lack of craft and manual knowledge on the part of many work ers Commendable efforts were and are still being made through trade 143THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY schools vestibule schools and other methods to build up the craft manual and technical knowledge of the workers so that there might be a general im provement in mechanical knowledge on the workmens part Unfortunately some of the early trade schools were subsidized by em ployers associations who had more than one motive in mind in maintain ing these institutions and others were controlled by men whose motives and ambitions outran their practical knowl edge of what was essential And here again there was but slight cooperation between the mass of the workers who were to be benefited and those who were to confer the benefits the latter feeling themselves amply qualified to direct and advise but little inclined to accept suggestions or work jointly with the workers and their representatives UPON WHAT DOES SATSIFACTORY PRODUCTION DEPEND Improved production depends upon a continual increasing development of mechanical knowledge and skill on the workmans part it depends upon sys tem for unless there is system there cannot be efficiency But it depends more than anything else upon coopera tion which in turn depends upon mu tual confidence The great problem of production is first of all the establish ing of mutual confidence How is this to be established It cannot be established if one of the parties to production considers himself superior to the other or relies upon its strength of numbers or of position It cannot be established if one of the parties lays down the rules which are to govern the other No man or group of men are so wise and gifted with so much natural ability that they are competent to prepare and enforce the rules which are to govern others At the very best they can but adopt the rules under which they themselves are to be governed Management consulting with itself is not competent to work out the most successful methods of production la bor consulting with itself is no more competent for production is a joint product it is the result of co6peration between a number of men occupying different positions and responsibilities The most competent managers opera ting with a most competent staff of subordinates are no more competent to work out the complicated human problem which plays so important a part in production than the trade unions would be to work out this prob lem without conferences with manage ment and an examination of the factors which must be understood and which must be recognized if production is to be successful The tradeunion movement has no patented system for solving the problem of production It places abiding faith in no system because manmade sys tems must of necessity have their de fects and shortcomings and systems devised wholly by management may have and frequently do have ulterior purposes which do not show them selves upon the surface But the American tradeunion movement has unlimited confidence in methods and principles and it is through the appli cation of these that it sees the most effective solution of the problem The American tradeunion movement is fully aware of the fact that wages de pend upon production and that wages are drawn not from the wealth which may have been accumulated in the past but from the production of today and tomorrow Labor is fully aware of the fact that the comforts of life and the opportu nities for better things in the future de pend upon a satisfactory volume of production It bases its hope upon the 144LABOR AND MANAGEMENT building up instead of the tearing down of industry But labor is quite con vinced as a result of its experiences that satisfactory production cannot exist unless there is cooperation and the principles and the methods which it believes to be essential to establish this are those which underlie the institutions of our common country the principles and the methods of democracy The citizens of the United States are loyal and they cooperate to as great if not a greater degree than the citizens of any other country and this is be cause there is a form of government in the United States under which govern ment exists only with the consent of the governed These principles and the methods are as sound in industry as they are in civil affairs In these days with the conceptions and ideals which have so firmly fixed themselves in mens minds the princi ple of autocracy or arbitrary power no longer enjoys the approval of the ma jority The problem of satisfactory production hinges largely upon whether industry is to be groupgoverned or selfgoverned and if it is to be self governed it is essential that manage ment and labor should consult to gether and jointly work out the rules and the conditions under which labor is to perform its part and management is to function Control of industry by management without cooperation and consultation with labor is as impractical today as would be the effort of group govern ment for the people without their consent

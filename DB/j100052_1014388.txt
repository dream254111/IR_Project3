J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1014388,FOOD THRIFT,I242676,FOOD THRIFT BY RAYMOND PEARL HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT OF BIOMETRY AND VITAL STATISTICS THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY FORMERLY CHIEF OF THE STATISTICAL DIVISION OF THE UNITED STATES FOOD ADMINISTRATION FOOD AN INDEX TO THE COST OF LIVING AJWHENEVER PEOPLE BECOME TROUBLED BY THE HIGH COST OF LIVING IT IS THE COST OF FOOD WHICH OCCUPIES THE FIRST AND FOREMOST PLACE IN THEIR MINDS EXPENDITURES FOR CLOTH ING AND FOR HOUSING THE OTHER CHIEF ITEMS OF COST IN OUR MERELY PHYSICAL STRUGGLE WITH THE ENVIRONMENT COME AT RELATIVELY INFREQUENT INTERVALS AS COMPARED WITH THOSE FOR VICTUALS AND DRINK TO USE THE OLD FORTH RIGHT PHRASE OLOGY EVERY DAY ONE MUST BUY HIS BREAD AND THE SAD FACT OF RISING PRICES IMPRESSES ITSELF WITH A VIGOR AND DEPTH WHICH PRESENTLY BECOMES SOULSTIRRING ON THE OTHER HAND THE COMMON MAN BUYS HIS NEW SUIT SO INFREQUENTLY AND THE PURCHASE IS FURTHERMORE SUCH AN ADVENTURE IN ITSELF AND ONE IN WHICH ONE WANTS TO MAKE A BRAVE SHOWING OF BEING A REGULAR MAN OF THE WORLD THAT A 50 OR EVEN 100 PER CENT ADVANCE IN THE PRICE OVER WHAT THE LAST SIMILAR SPREE COST IS MET WITH SUBSTANTIAL EQUANIMITY DURING THE WAR PRICES OF CLOTHING IN THIS COUNTRY ROSE OUT OF ALL PROPORTION TO THE PRICES OF FOOD BUT THE PUBLIC CLAMOR ABOUT HIGH PRICES VIRTUALLY ALL CENTERED AROUND THE LATTER THERE IS REAL JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS POINT OF VIEW ALSO IN THE FACT THAT IN THE MAINTENANCE OF A FAMILY FOOD EX PENDITURE CONSTITUTES RELATIVELY A VERY LARGE ITEM THIS HAS BEEN MOST RE CENTLY AND THOROUGHLY DISCUSSED BY PROFESSOR WILLIAM F OGBURN FROM WHOSE PAPER THE DATA OF THE FOLLOWING TABLE2 ARE TAKEN AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE FACTS AT THE PRESENT TIME TABLE I COST OF ACTUAL YEARLY

SIGNIFICANCE OF THE COLUMN HEADED EQUIVALENT ADULT MALES IS TO SHOW THAT ALL THE DATA WERE FROM FAMILIES OF APPROXIMATELY THE SAME SIZE SO FAR AS FOOD NEEDS ARE CONCERNED FURTHER DATA DISCUSSED BY OGBURN SHOW THAT AT PRESENT PRICE LEVELS THE OGBURN WILLIAM F A STUDY OF FOOD COSTS IN VARIOUS CITIES MONTHLY LABOR REVIEW VOL IX PP 303327 AUGUST 1919 2 LOC CIT P 312 118FOOD THRIFT EXPENDITURE FOR FOOD CONSTITUTES FOR CONSTANT SIZE OF FAMILY FROM 28 TO 38 PER CENT OF INCOMES OF 2100 PER YEAR AND FROM 39 TO 50 PER CENT OF INCOMES OF 900 A YEAR WITH INTERMEDIATE PERCENTAGES FOR INTERMEDIATE INCOMES IT IS NO WONDER THAT THE PROBLEM OF MERELY LIVING HAS BECOME AN EXTREMELY ACUTE ONE FOR MANY PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WHAT IS THE WAY OUT ANY THOUGHT FUL STUDENT OF ECONOMIC FORCES IN THIS COUNTRY KNOWS THAT IT IS NOT IN THE DI RECTION OF A LOWERED PRICE LEVEL AT LEAST IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE PARTICU LARLY SO FAR AS FOOD IS CONCERNED THE PRODUCER OF FOOD HAS ECONOMICALLY COME INTO HIS OWN DURING THE WAR AND IS NOT GOING TO SUBMIT COMPLACENTLY TO ANY MARKED LOWERING OF THE PRICE LEVEL OF HIS COMMODITIES AT ONCE AND IN HIS POWER TO CURTAIL PRODUCTION HE HAS OF COURSE AN ECONOMIC WEAPON OF FIRST MAGNITUDE BUT IN THE PRACTICE OF TRUE THRIFT IN REGARD TO FOOD EXPENDI TURES THE CONSUMING PUBLIC OF THIS COUNTRY HAS READY AT ITS HAND A MEANS OF COPING WITH THIS PROBLEM WHICH IS ALSO OF THE GREATEST SIGNIFICANCE AND ECONOMIC POWER THE REMAINDER OF THIS PAPER WILL BE DEVOTED TO THE TASK OF DEMONSTRATING THIS PROPOSITION AND ENDEAVORING TO SHOW WAYS AND MEANS PER CAPITA FOOD CONSUMPTION THE FIRST POINT TO BE CONSIDERED IN AN ANALYSIS OF THE SITUATION IS TO GET RELI ABLE FIGURES AS TO THE NORMAL PER CAPITA FOOD CONSUMPTION OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY I HAVE RECENTLY MADE AN EX TENSIVE AND THOROUGH STATISTICAL INVES TIGATION3 OF THIS SUBJECT AND FROM THAT 3 CF PEARL R THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION OF THE STAPLE COMMODITIES TO THE NATIONAL FOOD CONSUMPTION PROC AMER PHIL SOC VOL LVIII PP 182F22 1919 A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THE RESEARCH IS IN PRESS IN BOOK FORM UNDER STUDY I WISH TO PRESENT CERTAIN RESULTS HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE IT SHOULD BE SAID THAT THE BASIS OF ANY ADEQUATE SURVEY OF FOOD RESOURCES OR CONSUMP TION MUST BE ESSENTIALLY PHYSIOLOGICAL RATHER THAN ONE OF COMMODITIES OR TRADE BROADLY SPEAKING THE ULTI MATE SOURCES OF FOOD ARE THE SOIL AND THE SUN THE ENERGY DERIVED FROM THE SUN THROUGH THE MECHANISM OF THE GREEN PLANT BUILDS UP THE INORGANIC CHEMICAL ELEMENTS OF THE SOIL AIR AND WATER INTO COMPOUNDS WHICH CAN BE UTILIZED AS FOOD BY MAN EITHER DIRECTLY OR SECONDARILY IN THE FORM OF THE PROD UCTS OF ANIMALS WHICH HAVE BEEN NOUR ISHED ON THE PRIMARY FOODS OF THE PLANT WORLD FURTHERMORE FOOD MUST BE EXPRESSED FOR PROPER STATISTICAL TREAT MENT IN THE ULTIMATE CHEMICAL OR PHYSIOLOGICAL NUTRIENT COMPONENTS PROTEIN CARBOHYDRATE AND FAT WITH OF COURSE THE ENERGY VALUE IN CALORIES TABLE II GIVES IN CHEMICAL NUTRIENTS THE FOOD CONSUMPTION OF THE UNITED STATES ON A TOTAL AND PER CAPITA BASE FOR A PERIOD OF SEVEN YEARS BETWEEN JULY 1 1911 AND JUNE 30 1918 BE FORE ENTERING ON THE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF PER CAPITA CONSUMPTION FIGURES IN TABLE II IT IS WELL TO RECALL A FACT WHICH IS LIABLE TO ESCAPE ATTENTION UNLESS SPECIAL ATTENTION IS CALLED TO IT THIS IS THE FACT THAT THE FINAL FIGURES IN TABLE II WHICH ARE CALLED CONSUMPTION FIGURES REALLY INCLUDE SOMETHING MORE THAN CONSUMPTION IN A NUTRITIONAL SENSE THEY INCLUDE THE FOOD ACTUALLY EATEN PLUS THAT WHICH IS WASTED BY LOSS IN COOKING IN GARBAGE ETC IT IS NECES SARY TO BE ENTIRELY CLEAR ON THIS POINT THE TITLE THE NATIONS FOOD W B SAUNDERS CO PHILADELPHIA AND WILL SHORTLY APPEAR IN THE MEANTIME IT IS NECESSARY TO ASK THE READER TO TAKE ON FAITH THE STATEMENT THAT THE UTMOST CRITICAL CARE WAS TAKEN TO ENSURE THE GREATEST ATTAINABLE DEGREE OF ACCURACY IN THE FINAL FIGURES 119THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY IN CALCULATING THE NUTRIENTS IN THE IN TERMEDIATE CALCULATIONS USE HAS BEEN MADE OF FACTORS WHICH ALLOWED FOR IN EDIBLE REFUSE SO THAT ALL OF THE INEDIBLE PORTION OF THE FOODS AS PRODUCED OR IM PORTED HAVE ALREADY BEEN DEDUCTED IN THE CALCULATIONS UP TO THIS POINT FURTHERMORE GROSS LOSSES FROM STORAGE SPOILAGE TRANSPORTATION ETC HAVE BEEN DEDUCTED EVEN AFTER ALL THESE DEDUCTIONS HAVE BEEN MADE HOWEVER IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THERE IS STILL A CON SIDERABLE AMOUNT OF LOSS AND WASTAGE OF STRICTLY EDIBLE MATERIAL WHICH MIGHT BE SAVED AND CONSUMED UNDER A THEORET ICALLY IDEAL SYSTEM OF PREPARING FOOD FOR THE TABLE PLUS A CONSCIENTIOUS INGES TION OF EVERY BIT OF EDIBLE MATERIAL OF COURSE AS A MATTER OF FACT NEITHER OF THESE THEORETICALLY IDEAL CONDITIONS AT ALL PREVAIL THERE IS A CONSIDERABLE LOSS OF NUTRIENT VALUES IN THE PROCESS OF COOKING AS ORDINARILY PRACTICED THIS LOSS IS UNDOUBTEDLY GREATER FOR FATS THAN FOR ANY OTHER OF THE NUTRIENTS IT IS A TROUBLESOME AND TIMECONSUMING PROCESS FOR THE HOUSEWIFE TO CONSERVE AND UTILIZE ALL OF THE FAT WHICH GETS MELTED AND FLOATS ABOUT IN THE WATER IN WHICH FOODS ARE COOKED OR ADHERES TO THE UTENSILS IN WHICH THEY ARE COOKED NOR IN THE MINDS OF MOST PEOPLE IS THERE ANY NECESSITY OR DESIR ABILITY OF SAVING THIS FAT IN FACT A GREAT MANY PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY OB JECT VERY STRONGLY TO WHAT THEY DESIG NATE AS GREASY COOKING CONSE QUENTLY FLOATING FAT OF SOUP STOCK IS SKIMMED OFF AND THROWN AWAY IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF INSTANCES THE RESULT IS THAT IN CALCULATIONS MADE IN THE WAY THOSE OF THIS STUDY HAVE BEEN MADE WHICH INCLUDE THE TOTAL NUTRIENT VALUE IN THE EDIBLE PORTION OF FOOD MATERIALS AFTER DEDUCTING INEDIBLE WASTE AND THE LOSSES WHICH ACCRUE UP TO THE TIME THE FOOD REACHES THE CONSUMER THERE IS BOUND TO BE AN APPARENTLY HIGH CON SUMPTION OF FATS THE FIGURES HERE PRESENTED ARE REALLY STATEMENTS OF CONSUMPTION PLUS EDIBLE WASTE AND SHOULD BE SO REGARDED ANOTHER IMPORTANT FACTOR IS THAT OF EDIBLE WASTE IN GARBAGE THAT IS TO SAY THE UNEATEN PORTION OF THE PRE PARED FOOD WHICH IS EDIBLE AND MIGHT BE CONSUMED BUT IS NOT FOR REASONS OF TASTE OVERESTIMATION OF INGESTIVE CAPACITY ETC LOOKING AT THE MATTER FROM THE NA TABLE II CONSUMPTION PER ADULT MAN PROTEIN FAT CARBOHYDRATE

120FOOD THRIFT TIONAL POINT OF VIEW IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT OF THE PROTEIN IN HUMAN FOODS LEFT IN THE COUNTRY FOR CONSUMPTION IN THE STATISTICAL SENSE IT IS SAFE TO SAY THAT 5 PER CENT IS LOST IN EDIBLE WASTAGE OF THE FAT LEFT IN THE COUNTRY FOR CONSUMPTION AS HUMAN FOOD IT IS BELIEVED THAT AT LEAST 25 PER CENT IS LOST THROUGH WAST AGE THIS FIGURE SEEMS LARGE BUT IT PROBABLY UNDERESTIMATES RATHER THAN OVERESTIMATES THE FACT OF THE CAR BOHYDRATES PROBABLY THERE IS 20 PER CENT OF EDIBLE WASTAGE APPLYING THE ESTIMATED PERCENTAGE DEDUCTIONS FOR EDIBLE WASTAGE STATED ABOVE TO THE PER CAPITA

CLOSE TO THE FACT AS REGARDS PROTEIN AND CARBOHYDRATE THEYAREPERHAPS SOME WHAT TOO HIGH STILL AS REGARDS FAT BECAUSE THE EDIBLE WASTAGE OF THIS COM PONENT IS HIGHER THAN THE 25 PER CENT USED THE INTENTION HOWEVER HAS BEEN TO USE THE MOST CONSERVATIVE FIG URES IN ESTIMATING WASTE THE STABILITY OF FOOD CONSUMPTION IN PHYSIOLOGICAL UNITS ONE YEAR WITH ANOTHER IS ONE OF THE STRIKING THINGS BROUGHT OUT BY TABLE II PEOPLE CON SUME ABOUT THE SAME TOTAL AMOUNT YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT SO FAR AS WE MAY JUDGE BOTH FROM COMMON EXPERIENCE AND FROM CAREFUL STATISTICAL STUDY THIS STABILITY OF

WERE MADE FOR INEDIBLE REFUSE FOR LOSS BY SPOILAGE IN TRANSPORTATION STORAGE ETC SPECIFICALLY THESE DEDUC TIONS INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING CLASSES A LOSS OF COMMODITY IN STORAGE B SPOILAGE OF COMMODITY IN STORAGE C LOSS OF COMMODITY IN TRANSIT D SPOILAGE OF COMMODITY IN TRANSIT E LOSS BY VERMIN F AMOUNT FED TO LIVESTOCK G AMOUNT USED FOR TECHNICAL NONFOOD PURPOSES INCLUDING THE MANUFACTURE OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES H INEDIBLE REFUSE FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF THRIFT RATHER THAN THAT OF PURE STATISTICS IT MUST BE REMEMBERED WITH THE UTMOST CLARITY AND PRECISION THAT THE CONSUMING PUB LIC PAYS FOR ALL THESE LOSSES THE PRICES OF THE COMMODITIES ACTUALLY BOUGHT BY THE PUBLIC INCLUDE IN THEMSELVES AN AL LOWANCE FOR ALL OF THESE ITEMS IN THE CASE OF INEDIBLE REFUSE THIS IS APPARENT ONE KNOWS THAT HE PAYS FOR THE RIND OF A WATERMELON OR THE BONE IN A HAM HE IS NOT SO APT TO REMEMBER THAT HE PAYSFORTHE CORN ANDWHEAT THERATS EAT SO HERE THEN IN ITEMS A TO G ABOVE IS THE FIRST CLEARLY MARKED PLACE AT WHICH FROM A NATIONAL VIEWPOINT THE PRACTICE OF THRIFT WOULD INEVITABLY EFFECT A REDUCTION IN THE COUNTRYS FOOD BILL WHICH IN ABSOLUTE AMOUNT WOULD BE LITERALLY ENORMOUS AGAIN IT WAS POINTED OUT IN THE PRE CEDING SECTION THAT AFTER ALL THE DEDUC TIONS UNDER ITEMS A TO H INCLUSIVE HAD BEEN MADE THERE STILL WAS A LARGE AMOUNT OF EDIBLE WASTE THROWN AWAY IN THE FORM OF GARBAGE AND LOST IN COOK ING ETC IT IS POSSIBLE TO GIVE SOME DEFINITE FIGURES ON THE EFFECT WHICH THRIFT CAN HAVE ON THE REDUCTION OF THIS EDIBLE WASTAGE IN THE SUMMER OF 1917 MR HERBERT HOOVER WORKING THROUGH THE ORGANIZATION HE HAD BUILT UP WHICH WAS LATER TO BECOME THE UNITED STATES FOOD ADMINISTRATION ORGANIZED A NATIONWIDE CAMPAIGN TO URGE PEOPLE TO AVOID WASTE IN THE PREPARATION AND USE OF FOOD IN ORDER TO CHECK UP ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS CAMPAIGN STATISTICS4 WERE COLLECTED FROM 96 CITIES MONTHLY GIVING THE AMOUNT OF THE COLLECTION FOR EACH MONTH IN 191718 WHILE THE CONSERVATION CAMPAIGN WAS ON AND THE CORRESPOND

REMARKABLE THAN THIS QUANTITATIVE SAVING GREAT AS IT WAS WAS THE QUALITATIVE SAVING AS INDI CATED BY THE AMOUNT OF FAT IN THE GAR BAGE IN A NUMBER OF LARGE CITIES THERE ARE GARBAGE REDUCTION PLANTS

INTO THE GARBAGE CAN GENERAL STABILITY OF FOOD CON SUMPTION TABLE II AND FIGURE 1 INDICATE HOW DIFFICULT NOT TO SAY IMPOSSIBLE IT WOULD BE TO LOWER BY ANY SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT THE GROSS TOTAL FOOD INTAKE OF A NATIONS POPULATION SO LONG AS THERE IS AN ABUNDANCE AVAILABLE THE EXPERIENCE OF EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WAR SHOWS THAT DESPITE REGULATIONS HOWEVER DRASTIC AND PROPAGANDA FOR VOLUNTARY REDUC TION OF THE INTAKE PEOPLE WILL EAT JUST ABOUT THE SAME TOTAL AMOUNT IF THEY CAN GET IT THEY CAN BE INDUCED TO STOP WASTING AND TO SAVE EDIBLE MATE RIAL WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE GO INTO THE GARBAGE CAN ALSO IF THERE IS AN ACTUAL SHORTAGE OF ALL FOODS AS WAS THE CASE IN GERMANY DURING THE WAR THE TOTAL CALORY INTAKE WILL BE PERFORCE REDUCED BUT IN THE PRESENCE OF PLENTY ALL EXPE RIENCE GOES TO SHOW THAT THE FOOD CON SUMPTION OF ANY NATION PER CAPITA OF POPULATION IS EXCEEDINGLY STABLE OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME FROM THE STANDPOINT OF TRUE THRIFT IT IS DESIRABLE THAT SUCH STABILITY OF CONSUMPTION SHOULD OBTAIN THE HUMAN BODY IS A MACHINE FOOD IS ITS FUEL IF THE MACHINE IS TO MAINTAIN A GIVEN OUTPUT OF ENERGY IT MUST CON SUME A GIVEN PROPER AMOUNT OF FUEL TO TRY TO MAKE THE MACHINE PERFORM ON A REDUCED FUEL CONSUMPTION BELOW THE LEVEL WHICH HUMAN EXPERIENCE THROUGH CENTURIES HAS SHOWN TO BE THE OPTIMUM FOR EFFICIENT PERFORMANCE FOOD THRIFT 123THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY WOULD BE THE HEIGHT OF FOLLY SO LONG AS ADEQUATE SUPPLIES ARE AVAILABLE THE HUMAN MACHINE IS SO DELICATELY ORGAN IZED THAT THERE IS EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT IF THE NATIONS TOTAL CALORY INTAKE WERE TO BE REDUCED BY SO SMALL AN AMOUNT AS 10 OR EVEN 5 PER CENT OVER A PERIOD OF MONTHS THE RESULTS WOULD BE PROMPTLY APPARENT IN IN CREASED MORTALITY RATES DIMINISHED OUTPUT OF INDUSTRY AND GREATLY IN CREASED MORBIDITY THE POINTS WHICH WERE STRESSED IN MR HOOVERS FOOD ADMINISTRATION CONSERVATION CAMPAIGN SEEM TO POINT THE WAY TO TRUE AND SOUND FOOD THRIFT MORE WISELY AND JUSTLY THAN HAS EVER BEEN DONE BEFORE THESE POINTS WERE ESSENTIALLY 1 GENERAL CONSERVATION BY THE ELIM INATION OF WASTE OF EDIBLE MATERIALS WHEREVER AND HOWEVER POSSIBLE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS HAS BEEN DEMON STRATED BY THE GARBAGE FIGURES TO TAKE BUT A SINGLE INSTANCE MANY OTHERS MIGHT BE GIVEN 2 SPECIAL CONSERVATION BY SUBSTITU TION OF ONE FOOD MATERIAL FOR ANOTHER WHICH IT WAS DESIRED TO SAVE FOR ESSEN TIALLY MILITARY PURPOSES THIS WAS THE METHOD TAKEN TO CONSERVE A SHORT WHEAT SUPPLY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS SPECIAL CON SERVATION IS WELL SHOWN IN FIGURE 2 FIG 2 SHOWING THE PERCENTAGE INCREASE OR DECREASE IN CONSUMPTION IN 191718 AS COMPARED WITH THE ANNUAL AVERAGE OF THE SIX YEARS PRE CEDING FOR EXPLANATION SEE TEXT 124FOOD THRIFT IN THIS DIAGRAM THE TOTAL LENGTH OF THE BARS FROM THE 0 LINE SHOWS THE TOTAL PERCENTAGE INCREASE OR DECREASE IN CONSUMPTION IN 191718 AS COMPARED WITH THE PRECEDING SIX YEARS THE CROSSHATCHED PORTION OF EACH BAR SHOWS THE PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN POP ULATION AND THEREFORE THE PART OF THE INCREASED CONSUMPTION TO BE EXPECTED AS A RESULT OF POPULATION INCREASE WHERE THE BLACK BAR IS BELOW THE TOP OF THE CROSSHATCHED POPULATION BAR IT MEANS A CONSERVATION THUS THE TRUE CONSERVATION ON WHEAT AMOUNTED TO 10805731653 PER CENT OF THE NORMAL AVERAGE CONSUMPTION IT WILL BE NOTED AT ONCE THAT THE COMMODITIES SHOWING GREAT INCREASES IN CONSUMPTION IN 191718 OVER THE PRE CEDING YEARS ARE FOR THE MOST PART THOSE WHICH THE FOOD ADMINISTRATION URGED TO BE SUBSTITUTED FOR ARTICLES OF WHICH THE SUPPLY WAS LESS ABUNDANT AND FOR WHICH THE NEEDS OF THE ALLIES WERE GREATER THUS RYE WHICH CON STITUTED THE MOST POPULAR OF THE SUB STITUTES FOR WHEAT IN THE PUBLIC MIND SHOWS THE GREATEST INCREASED CONSUMP TION IN 191718 NEXT TO IT STANDS THE OTHER CEREALS OF OUR CLASSIFICA TION INCLUDING BARLEY AND BUCKWHEAT NUTS RICE AND THE VEGETABLES GENERALLY SHOW INCREASES BEYOND THE POPULATION INCREASE SHOWING THAT THE PEOPLE VERY GENERALLY FOLLOWED THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE FOOD ADMINISTRATION TO CONSUME MORE OF THESE PRODUCTS AND SAVE WHEAT THE ARTICLES ON WHICH THE FOOD ADMIN ISTRATION MOST STRONGLY URGED CON SERVATIONNAMELY WHEAT BEEF MUT TON PORK AND THE SUGARSALL SHOW EITHER A CONSUMPTION ACTUALLY BELOW THE NORMAL AVERAGE OR ELSE A VERY SLIGHT ABSOLUTE INCREASE WELL BELOW THE POPULATION PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN EITHER CASE A REAL AND SUBSTANTIAL CON SERVATION IS OF COURSE SHOWN THE DECREASE IN CONSUMPTION OF THE MOST POPULAR FRUITS ORANGES APPLES AND BANANAS IS LARGELY IF NOT ENTIRELY EX PLAINED BY HIGH PRICES FOR THESE PRODUCTS THE HEALTH AND EFFICIENCY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DID NOT SUFFER IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE FROM THESE FOOD SUB STITUTIONS THERE IS NO REASON WHY THE SAME METHOD CANNOT BE VOLUNTARILY APPLIED BY THE PEOPLE IN PEACE AS WELL AS IN WAR AND FOR ECONOMIC AS WELL AS MILITARY MOTIVES DURING THE PAST SUMMER I HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF VISITING AND TALKING OVER THE ECONOMIC SITUATION WITH A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF THE LARGEST MANUFACTURERS OF ALL KINDS OF FOOD PRODUCTS FROM THE ATLANTIC TO THE PACIFIC COAST THE OUTSTAND ING GENERAL RESULT OF THIS EXPERIENCE TO WHICH THE SUPPORTING TESTIMONY WAS VIRTUALLY UNANIMOUS WAS THAT THE DEMAND FOR THE HIGHEST GRADE OF FANCY PRODUCTS PUT UP IN THE MOST EXPENSIVE WAY IN THE MOST COSTLY PACKAGES WAS GREATER THAN COULD BE SUPPLIED WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND STANDARD GRADES OF WHICH THE FOOD VALUE WAS JUST AS GREAT BUT THE PRICE LOWER WERE DIFFICULT TO DISPOSE OF AND YET DURING THIS VERY PERIOD THERE WAS GREAT PUB LIC CLAMOR COUPLED WITH ACTIVITY ABOUT EQUALLY FURIOUS AND FUTILE ON THE PART OF OUR LEGISLATORS REGARDING THE HIGH COST OF LIVING IN GENERAL AND OF FOOD IN PARTICULAR IT COSTS A MANUFACTURER A DEFINITE AND SUBSTANTIAL EXCESS AMOUNT TO PRODUCE A HIGHLY FANCY FOOD PRODUCT BUT THE PRODUCT CONTAINS NO MORE PROTEIN OR FAT OR CARBOHYDRATE OR CALORIES THAN DOES A STANDARD ARTICLE SOMETIMES INDEED LESS NOR IS THE FANCY GRADE ANY MORE SANITARY BROADLY SPEAKING YET PEOPLE ARE LOATH TO

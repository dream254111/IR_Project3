j100358,The School Review,1075233,History in the Curriculum of the Commercial High School,i244557,HISTORY IN THE CURRICULUM OF THE COMMER CIAL HIGH SCHOOL1 ANY treatment of the topic assigned to me must take into account two notable reports on historical studies in secondary schools that of the subcommittee of the Committee of Ten known as the  Madison Conference Report  I892 and that of the Committee of Seven of the American Historical Asso ciation 1898 The reports just noted include some discussion of the civil government and political economy It has not been thought wise however to introduce any treatment of these subjects in the present paper they are deemed of sufficient importance for commercial work to warrant an independent discussion of them The report of the Madison Conference also includes recommen dations concerning historical work in the elementary schools it does not seem advisable to introduce the elementaryschool problem in this connection The recommendation of the Committee of Ten subcommit tee is for a study of Greek Roman English American and French history with one year to be devoted to the intensive study of some period It recommends that European history be taught in connection with the history of England and France or in the final year of intensive study This committee favors the pursuing of historical studies continuously through the four years of the highschool course The Committee of Seven also recommends for four years of continuous historical study in the high school as follows one year of ancient history dealing with Greece and Rome prin cipally but also including some account of the oriental nations It further favors taking in connection with the ancient history the Middle Ages to the early ninth century The com mittee recommends for the second year general European his I Read before the Business Section of the National Educational Association Boston 572CURRICULUM OF THE COMMERCIAL HIGH SCHOOL tory from the early ninth century to the present time for the third year English history and for the fourth American his tory and civil government In a supplementary suggestion this committee advises that if but three years can be secured for historical study general European history be omitted and English history be so treated as to include the most important phases of the continental history parallel with it On the basis of the above reports as well as from the experi ence in commercial schools I make the following recommenda tion for history in the curriculum of high schools of commerce Four years should be devoted to the subject first general his tory to circa 800 AD second English history including the main movements in the history of continental Europe third American history and fourth a general history of commerce It is believed that this division will give at once the most rational general survey of the historical field and the best practical results that can be secured from the study of history in commer cial schools Various explanations have been given for arrangements of historical studies different from that above indicated One prin cipal of a commercial high school justifies taking English his tory before the ancient with the argument that English history has the greater practical value and as the larger number of students are in the first year they should be given the subject having the greater value I doubt if the first premise on which this reasoning is based is sound If students are to be but one year in school they will probably get a better educational result from a study of ancient history than could be had from a study of English history without the ancient as a foundation In any event the reasoning is specious and if adopted would lead to furnishing the narrowly technical short course Others have urged the teaching of the history of commerce in connection with general history on the ground that by such an arrangement repetitions would be saved and this division of the subject brought into its proper relations to history as a whole This suggestion sounds plausible but I believe there are practical difficulties in carrying it into effect 573THE SCHOOL REVIEW History may be considered as a texture into which there are woven many threads We cannot undertake to say how many of these there are or to what extent they may be singled out Among the more generally recognized threads of interest in history are political and constitutional military church and economic history The history of commerce is a branch of the latter It would be a mistake for the student of commerce to try to follow the thread of his interest without some knowledge of the whole of which it is a part Similarly it would be unfair to deny him the privilege of following this thread when he has been prepared to do so This should be to the commercial schools the year of intensive study  it may however be devoted to one topic extending over a wide period rather than to many topics for a briefer period The history of commerce should serve as the vocational study of history for commercial schools It should occupy in its special schools the place occupied by the history of education in schools of education church history in theological seminaries the history of law in law schools and military and naval history in the academies devoted to the education of soldiers and sailors In these several treatments of history each has a different thread to disentangle from the great coil  facts that are principal to one are often minor to another Students in com mercial schools should single out the phase of history dealing with their special work and study it not lost in the mazes of other interests but as a distinct thing I am not favorable to making history an elective subject It has for the high school of commerce a cultural and practical value that warrants its being made required work for the four years of the course The Committee of Nine of this section may think it wise to offer an election in the fourth year between the general history of commerce and a more intensive study of mod ern commercial history I am frank to say that I incline to the general course There are reasons for the preference just expressed that grow out of a consideration of the recommendation made at the open ing of this paper For classical and English high schools we 574CURRICULUM OF THE COMMERCIAL HIGH SCHOOL may well question the wisdom of the Committee of Sevens rec ommendation covering the scope and method of treatment of the ancient period But with a general sketch of the history of commerce it will be possible to overcome disabilities that might arise from a bad division of subjectmatter and an improper rela tion of parts Again the general sketch can give the proper historical perspective that might be lost from the omission of European history Anyone who has taught the history of Europe in connection with the history of England will understand what I mean when I say there is danger that the student will regard the history of continental nations as a mere tail to the English historys kite The history of commerce will show perhaps bet ter than any other division of history that England was influ enced far more by the continent of Europe than was the continent by England Thus the history of commerce furnishes at once the means of historical review and the principles of sound interpretation for history as a whole Concerning the time requirement I would suggest that if possible three hours a week should be devoted to history throughout the four years of the commercial highschool course If it is thought wise to take the subject as a halfyear one five hours a week at least should be given to it for four halfyears I am asked to treat especially the value of historical studies in commercial schools The value of history in general is well recognized this phase of the subject has been ably handled in the two reports mentioned at the opening of this paper as well as in several recent books on the study and teaching of history I shall not take time therefore to discuss the general phases of the subject It may be worth while to remark in passing that the history taught in the secondary school is largely a matter of selection from the ample and readily accessible material Now it seems wise for commercial schools to select for the first three years those phases of the subject that will best prepare for the fourth years work The writing and interpretation of history are influenced con sciously and unconsciously by the period in which it is written or interpreted The present distinctively economic age is having 575THE SCHOOL REVIEW its effect alike on the interpretation of old historical writings and the production of new ones We may congratulate our selves that both our authors and textbook compilers are giving economic history its proper place in relation to constitutional military church and other phases of historical writing Indus try and commerce are claiming new attention in general history and from what has been termed a melancholy record of human crimes and calamities history thus passes to be the animating register of the industry and ingenuity of men With the change in point of view from military to economic history there is less attention to the ways in which men are killed and more to the ways in which they are kept alive There are special advantages in the economic interpretation of general history More than any other branch of the subject it contributes to correct notions of the unity of all history Economic history deals with the basal needs of men for food clothing and shelter and these have been much the same in all ages Teachers in commercial schools will not be slow to recognize the advantages that will come from a study of history in which the economic aspects of the subject have been given their proper setting It remains to speak further of the value of the special history recommended for the fourth year This is the distinctively vocational subject in the historical group Its highest though by no means its sole function is in the orientation it gives the student before he takes up his calling Every commercial man should find the highest pleasure and usefulness in his work Knowledge of the past of any worthy calling ennobles its pres ent and makes for its future The business man can ill afford to be cut off from a knowledge of the development of the field of his activity It smacks of cant to say that an acquaintance with the history of commerce will make of the man of com merce at once a better man and a better commercial man but it needs to be said The above statement is true because the history of commerce shows the business man his true place in relation to the phe nomena with which he deals To carry on a calling to best advantage one should know what those who preceded him did 576CURRICULUM OF THE COMMERCIAL HIGH SCHOOL and where they left off Two ends will be served by such knowledge on the part of those in commercial life it will make them more humble and it will exalt and dignify their work Many of the selfimportant business men of the present should learn that they are only inheritors from the work of other men Scarce a business custom but is rooted in the past and many of them come from the remote past Present commercial life cannot be cut off from its past and business men should recog nize that they enter into the heritage of other mens labor But familiarity with the lives of great merchants and knowl edge of the accomplishment of other commercial people and times will do more than to make business men humble It will stimulate and encourage them In the grind of daily toil one needs to be lifted up with the thought that he is not the beall and the endall the alpha and the omega of his work A con scientious minister of the gospel said to me recently that he found great comfort in the doctrine of evolution When pressed for an explanation he said that he saw so little direct result from his labor that he could not carry it on unless he was encouraged with the thought of an ultimate result to which he was contribut ing The business man too will be encouraged to feel that there are within the realm of his work ultimate worthy ends to the reaching of which he may contribute The division of com mercial history into ancient medieval and modern is misleading We can say of all these divisions as Dr Arnold said of the sixth and seventh books of Thucydides they are modern history With a proper study of the history of commerce it becomes to the present economic age what Lecky termed political history a great searchlight on the deck of a ship illuming the path over which the ship has passed and casting its beams forward to define a future cause There are many advantages from a study of the history of commerce but if it do nothing else than to give to future business men a proper attitude toward their work it will have a value second to no other subject of the curriculum I am fully aware that there are differences among us as to what are the essentials in the history of commerce as there would be in trying to determine the essentials in almost any 577578 THE SCHOOL REVIEW other subject Commercial history is too new and indefinite for a profitable discussion of this phase of the subject To me the most vitally important thing about this as about any other branch of history is that it shall connect the present with the past In our teaching the present may be made to call back to the past or the past to call forward to the present It is the duty of every generation to gather up its inheritance and thus to serve the present and prepare better things for the future Yet I doubt not thro the ages one increasing purpose runs And the thoughts of men are widened with the process of the

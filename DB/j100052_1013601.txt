Instructor in Insurance Wharton School of Finance and Commerce University of Pennsylvania THE ANTAGONISTIC PRINCIPLES OF COMPETITION AND COOPERATION During the recent development of fire insurance in the United States the problem of the medium or agency through which rates should be promulgated has given rise to two radically different solutions These solutions are irreconcilable mainly by reason of the opposing premises upon which they rest One presupposes that competition is the most effective method of securing justice in rates as between communities classes of risks and persons while the other assumes that the greatest measure of equity will be attained through co6peration The trend of thought of the advocates of competition is based upon history and analogy Having observed instances of large combinations exacting exorbitant profits through freedom from competition their conclusion is that lack of competition is the cause of extortion and that restoration of rivalry is the logical remedy What more natural than to apply such a general conclusion to the business of fire insurance with the resulting conviction that the public welfare in this field will be best protected by denying com bined action with respect to rates of premium In this predis posed state of mind every united effort of underwriters is viewed as inimical to public welfare and every association as a com bination in restraint of trade Thus an association of agents in Missouri designed to secure concerted action in the quoting of fire insurance rates was characterized by the court as a plain palpable but bungling pool trust agreement combination con federation and understanding organized to avoid said antitrust statute 1 The inevitable result of such convictions is the enact ment of antimonopoly antitrust and anticompact legislation State v Firemens Fund Ins Co 150 Mo 113 1899 172FIRE INSURANCE The reasoning of those who extol the benefits of co6peration coincides with that of the advocates of competition as far as a portion of the argument is concerned agreeing that combinations have at times proved detrimental to public welfare But here the similarity in thought ceases Those who favor co6peration main tain that combinations and monopolies are not killed but fostered by competition and that a greater evil discrimination between consumers is traceable to the unregulated endeavor to obtain business Applying their thought to the field of fire insurance combinations of underwriters were an economic necessity because militant competition had not merely made the business unprofitable but had threatened the very existence of many companies Those in the occupation believed that if such conditions continued a sur vival of the strongest would inevitably result and all the business fall under the absolute control of a few large companies The only remedy appeared to be associated action On the other hand this competition was resulting in discrimination between individual policyholders but with no benefit to policyholders as a class In a struggle to obtain business each company felt justified in offering inducements where necessary to secure the risk and the richest and most powerful property owners were those who secured the greatest concessions These were at the expense of the weak of course since in the end aggregate premiums must be sufficient to pay aggregate losses and expenses In many companies where the sacrifices made in some directions could not be counterbalanced in others safety and continued existence were endangered The small insured therefore not only derived no benefit from the cutting of rates but saw the value of his indemnitywhich depends upon the strength of the insurersteadily depreciating Inasmuch as busi ness was secured through agents furthermore competition caused commissions to rise to exorbitant figures at times to the added burden of the insured Such are the facts and conclusions furnished by the advocates of competition and their adversaries and the history of fire insurance legislation affecting rates is largely a history of the conflict of these two ideas THE DEVELOPMENT OF CO6PERATION Relatively early in our history dissatisfaction with unhindered competition and its attendant ratecutting was apparent Advances 173THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY toward united effort however were spasmodic and results merely temporary In New York City for example a rate agreement was made in 1821 but by 1825 the number of new companies formed so increased competition as to cause its abandonment In 1826 an association was formed for similar purposes but by 1843 had ceased existence In 1845 rates were again raised to a profitable basis and from 1849 to 1865 New York City witnessed the estab lishment of no less than seventy new companies Similar experi ences are recorded in the annals of the Hartford Board of Fire Underwriters and other longestablished boards In 1866 an effort of far greater scope brought about the formation of the National Board of Fire Underwriters composed of seventyfive companies with the common purpose to establish and maintain as far as practicable a system of uniform rates of premium A rating bureau was organized by the National Board and the United States divided into six territorial departments for the pur poses of ratemaking In 1868 thirtyseven leading companies entered into the  Chicago Compact pledging themselves to remove any local agent upon the second conviction for violating National Board rates But by 1870 it was officially though reluctantly acknowledged that rates were not being generally adhered to and they were suspended Following the Chicago fire in 1871 and the Boston conflagration in 1872 premiums were again temporarily maintained but by 1876 conditions had returned to the usual state of demoralization and in 1877 the ratemaking function of the Board was abandoned in favor of local and sectional boards of fire underwriters which have continued important factors until the present time Practically the entire country is now supervised by a group of associations and bureaus2 THE NATURE AND SERVICES OF UNDERWRITERS ASSOCIATIONS Classification of Associations On a territorial basis associa tions of fire underwriters may be classed as national sectional and local Since the relinquishment by the National Board of the ratemaking function the national associations have concerned themselves with educational and technical activities such as the promotion of harmony correct practices repression of arson and s See

safe methods of building construction fire protective measures and adequate fire departments These associations although of the highest importance were not directly connected with fire insurance rates from 1877 to 1914 The respective territories of the sectional organizations include from one to thirteen states of the United States The Western Union for example approximately covers the Middle West the Association of the Middle Department has jurisdiction in Pennsyl vania Delaware Maryland and West Virginia Such organizations perform in a broader way functions similar to those of the local boards described later The following map shows the jurisdiction of a number of the prominent sectional organizations176 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY   I  FIRE INSURANCE 177 But in many cities of great importance in the states controlled by sectional organizations we find local associations exercising authority over fire rates This is true for example of New York Philadelphia Boston and Baltimore The term local is some what general but is best restricted to an association operating within a large city or in the adjacent suburbs Local associations may be subclassified as urban and suburban Thus the New York Fire Insurance Exchange confines its activities principally to Man hattan the Bronx and Brooklyn while the Suburban Fire Insurance Exchange supervises four adjacent counties and certain other specially designated territory The following maps show typical examples of division of territory between such associations NEW YORKTHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY Organization of Underwriters Associations As is true of many business associations of the present day the government of the exchanges is in the main a government by committees An execu tive committee usually elective is in general control of all the activities of the organization exercising universal supervision but delegating a large portion of the actual work to a number of stand ing committees Four such committees at least are usually found in all associations A committee on brokerage prescribes rules for admission to the association investigates applications for member ship and issues certificates to the successful applicants In some cases this committee acts as a court to investigate complaints against members but an appeal may generally be taken from its decision to an arbitration committee The latter hears these and other cases which lie within its jurisdiction and upon conviction imposes the appropriate penalty usually consisting of a fine en forced cancellation of policies involved or of preventing the offend ing member from writing a particular risk or risks either directly or by reinsurance for one year The latter may involve consider able loss of business For grave offences the accused may be ex pelled A committee on losses and adjustments usually exists for 178FIRE INSURANCE the purpose of promoting good practice and equity in the settlement of fire losses In some cases such committees have been instru mental in obtaining the adoption of uniform rules to govern com plicated adjustments One of the most important committees is the committee on rates which deals directly with the larger prob lems of ratemaking and delegates certain duties to the secretary of the exchange and an inspection and rating department Through the committee on rates the association fixes specific and minimum rates for the writing of insurance which are adhered to throughout its jurisdiction A minimum rate applies to all risks of a same general description such as dwellings Specific rates are rates on individual risks specified by location and description and usually arrived at by the use of schedules The Economic Functions of Underwriters Associations From the brief description given of competitive conditions and the origin of associations it is evident that they were economic necessities One of the founders of the National Board said in 1866 Without an organization of this kind insurance companies would be in the position of Kilkenny cats They would devour each other and leave nothing but the tips of their tails 3 Formed to meet an economic need they have performed an economic service although the benefits of their activities are often lost sight of in the criticism of their mistakes 1 The Promotion of Economy In the first place they have encouraged economy in the fixing of fire insurance premiums A common organization now performs for all companies in an efficient manner the work which was once performed by each company individually in any manner it saw fit accomplishing an enormous saving in labor and expense and it must be remembered that the insureds premium pays for expenses as well as losses Coincident therewith have come the benefits of specialization and division of labor Instead of a company representative inspecting and rating at the same time a trained inspector hands over the result of his labor to a department trained to apply the appropriate rating schedule to the conditions as set forth in his report In the second place through the establishment of uniform rates of commission to brokers and agents the acquisition costs have been kept lower  Mark Howard at the convention called to organize the National Board of Fire Underwriters 179THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY than would otherwise have been the case Regulation of commis sions it must be admitted has not yet reached the standard of regulation of rates but it has eliminated the former enormous sporadic increases of commission rates during influxes of competi tion Likewise it has done much to eradicate the evils of the re bate which entails a preference of one policyholder over another Thirdly the association has provided co6perative action against legislation prejudicial to the companies and often to both the companies and the public as for instance valued policy and retalia tory laws A protective alliance is the only defence against state legislation which one year permits companies to employ a common expert to make rates and the next year makes any combination of this nature a penitentiary offence 2 Standardization The associations have in many ways promoted the standardization of rates and rating systems They have furnished a permanent means for the constant study of the process of arriving at an equitable rate and have been of vast assistance in the formation of rating schedules which mark the great steps in the development of fire insurance rating from a guess to a science Partially successful schedules once attained they have furnished a medium or agency for the application of the same with the least cost One of their greatest services has been the creation of uniformity in charges and the prevention of discrimination be tween localities classes of risks kinds of policies and persons They have eliminated the ratewars previously referred to with their demoralization of business and deterioration in the value of the insureds policy They have attempted the classification of loss statistics although this activity never reached adequate importance until 1914 when the National Board of Fire Underwriters again interested itself in the subject of rates Through the medium of certain associations standard tables have been adopted for quoting rates on insurance for a term of less than one year known as short rate tables The fire insurance associations have also been instru mental in the adoption of a standard fire policy the meaning of which has been largely settled by the courts and the adoption of standard endorsements and clauses adequate to meet exceptional circumstances 3 General Results In addition to the above the establish ment of associations has had certain beneficial results difficult to 180FIRE INSURANCE classify such as the elimination of objectionable practices expul sion from the business of undesirable members mutual counsel mutual assistance and prevention of and protection against fire DEVELOPMENT OF THE PRINCIPLE OF COMPETITION The Common Law4 In the absence of antitrust statutes or where these laws have been held not to apply to combinations of insurance companies the common law is available for the redress of real or fancied public grievances For many years this was the only protection in some states against combinations prejudicial to general interests and we find several cases of proceedings against underwriters associations under the common law Its principle in brief is that any agreements in restraint of trade which are against public policy are void and unenforceable They are sometimes called illegal but only in the above sense it is generally admitted Every case brought under the common law must therefore be judged in the light of the attendant circumstances Does the asso ciation unduly restrain trade or is it contrary to public policy Full discussions of the application of this principle to various other businesses can be found elsewhere5 and we may consider here only cases directly involving fire insurance The general principle stated above was upheld by the court in a comparatively recent case in the following words The most that can be said as to the combination to fix regulate and control the business of fire insurance in the city of Newport News is that it was an agreement in restraint of trade But agreements merely in restraint of trade are not illegal in the sense that they are either indictable or actionable 6 In another case a party to an agree ment complained when its terms were applied to him but the court refused him aid inasmuch as he had caused the injury of which he complained by his unlawful acts 7 Associations of fire underwriters have been attacked on the 4 For a more detailed

such circumstances it was necessary to show that unreasonable restraint affecting the public interest was exercised or that insurance should be considered an article of necessity The view that insurance is affected with a public interest is well supported but there is little ground for con sidering it an indispensable necessity of life Owing to the difficulty of showing unreasonable restraint or the importance to the public of fire insurance actions under the common law have not been very successful although in some cases the courts have held certain acts of associations such as regulating the intercourse of members pro hibiting members from having more than two agents in congested districts of a city requiring the cancellation of risks written at other than the board rates etc to be contrary to public policy void and illegal AntiTrust Statutes8 With the development of the antipathy to the socalled trusts came the enactment of laws forbidding in general terms combinations which were designed to regulate com petition or enhance or maintain prices These laws were applicable to trade commerce business dealings in commodities etc and the question soon arose of whether or not insurance might be considered within the scope of such expressions In several cases it was held that insurance could not be con sidered trade or a  commodity in the sense in which those words were used in the statutes and that only by a strained construction could it be included within the term commerce The effect of such decisions was avoided in Texas by the insertion in the statute of the word business To include insurance within their juris diction the laws referred to would have had to be very specific and accurate in wording and being designed to have a broad applica tion this they seldom were9 There is still doubt in some states as to whether or not laws of this type are applicable to insurance or not Thus the secretary of state is of the opinion that the anti trust law of Mississippi may be so construedl0 8 For citations of laws of this nature existing in at least thirty states on Jan uary 1 1914 and court cases which have arisen under the same see the authors

Insurance Laws Taxes Fees 1915 p 126 182FIRE INSURANCE AntiCompact Laws Since it was doubtful to say the least whether insurance might be considered as within the scope of a general antitrust statute laws specifically enumerating insurance as a subject for legislation were passed which in brief forbade any combination or agreement for the purpose of regulating or fixing the price or premium to be paid for insuring property against loss or damage by fire Since the power to regulate insurance does not rest with the federal government combinations to fix rates on business written within the state are valid subjects for the exercise of state powers and in one case the court held such regulation of business to be a proper exercise of the police power The state may expel from its territory companies which unlawfully participate in pools and combinations Briefly summarizing the decisions on the validity of state action they are to the effect that anticompact laws do not violate state or federal constitutional provisions em bodying right of contract equal protection of the laws and due process of law Various devices have been invented to evade the effect of such legislation but with little success Where agents formed an asso ciation the rules of which required the stamping of policies for the purpose of supervising rates and where an independent rater sold to the companies rates which were maintained by having policies pass through a stamping department the courts held that these were illegal attempts to evade the spirit of the law2 No tendency to limit the application of these laws is apparent as in 1912 com binations to maintain rates defined by law as trusts were again held to be unlawfull3 Defects of Competition as a Basis for Rates All of the laws which have been thus far considered have had as their basic prin ciple the idea that equitable rates and public benefit could be secured by repressing rates through competition All actions against associations under the common law under antitrust statutes and under laws prohibiting agreements regarding rates to be charged were designed to keep insurers in a contest where U For citations of laws and cases see Fire

OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY survival would require rates from which the insured might tempo rarily benefit They were constant incentives not to uniformity in rates but to diversity The assumption of the beneficence of com petition in fire insurance rates is far from correct when considered in the light of the history of the business 1 In the competitive struggle perpetuated by such laws it is not possible for policyholders generally and as a class to benefit There are numerous property owners offering risks of such magni tude that their acquisition measurably swells the business of the company and just as a manufacturer puts forth more effort to obtain a large contract than a small one so insurance companies in the competitive state offer greater inducements in order to obtain a large risk than they would to obtain a small one As in the rail road business under competitive rates the small shipper was dis criminated against in favor of the large14 so in the fire insurance business under competitive rates the small property owner is dis criminated against in favor of the large Not only does the small property owner reap no benefit from the competition but the premiums he pays must be sufficient to make up any deficiencies in the premium collections from large property holders 2 Unrestrained competition may also otherwise adversely affect the insured The commodity which he purchases indemnity for possible loss is not delivered upon payment of the premium but some time subsequently When one is likely to call upon a corpora tion to deliver something in the future it is not desirable to so weaken that corporation as to make fulfilment of its contract doubtful it is rather to the buyers best interest to promote its solvency Yet the periods of unrestrained competition in the past have been fruitful sources of fire insurance failures As stated by the New York Legislative Investigating Committee The universal effect of such periods of open competition wherever and whenever they have occurred has been a cutting of rates to a point that was below the actual cost of the indemnity The effect on all com panies is weakening 15 3 It has been argued that since competition is esteemed a 14 Hadley Railroad Transportation 1885 Johnson and Van Metre Prin ciples of Railroad Transportation p 511 1 1911 p 41 See also report of Illinois Commission 1911 Wisconsin Legislative Committee 1913 184FIRE INSURANCE satisfactory method for obtaining equitable prices in such indus tries as the grocery business or the shoe business there is no reason for not so regarding it in fire insurance This ignores a fundamental difference between insurance and the kinds of business mentioned In the grocery or shoe business there has never been a general recognition of the principle that prices should be based on cost on the contrary it is well recognized that they are frequently not so determined In nearly every discussion of fire insurance pre miums on the other hand we find references to the desirability of having the premiums commensurate with losses rates based upon the amount of hazard equity between localities and similar expressions inferring that rates should vary with losses and expenses16 Even in other lines of business where cost does more or less enter as a price factor the cost is definitely known in advance and prices may be fixed conformably In insurance the cost can only be estimated in advance on the basis of experience it does not stare the underwriter in the face in the same way that the buying price of sugar confronts the grocer 17 Consequently under the stress of competition the underwriter is more likely to reduce premiums below costs than the grocer to reduce selling prices below costs 4 In the struggle for business which ensues upon the inaugura tion of rate competition it is but natural for the insurance company to avail itself not only of rate reductions but of another almost equally effective inducement in securing businessincreased com missions to agents and brokers Thus the small insured who derives no benefit from competition sees himself constrained to contribute more in order to meet the increased cost of doing busi ness entailed by it As stated in the New York report Competi tion therefore in fire insurance has acted badly both as regards rates and expenses but in different ways It has driven rates too low and expenses too high 18 5 Finally unrestrained competition under presentday con ditions leads ultimately to monopoly through the elimination of the weak or unfortunate and the survival of a few large and strong 16 See e g conclusion of Illinois Investigating Commission 1911 that the fire insurance rate is a tax 17 Report of the New York Legislative Investigating Committee 1911 p 42 18 Report of Joint Committee to Investigate Insurance Feb 1911 p 94 185THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY companies A theory that prices tend toward costs is only partially true in a business where a good portion of expenses continue whether risks are written or not It is true that when premiums rise and profits increase additional capital is attracted to the business and profits cease to rise but the opposite that when prices fall below costs competition for business will cease and prices tend to rise does not necessarily follow For while competition for business at low rates may involve loss not to compete often involves greater loss Thus whether a company writes a risk at a low rate or not certain expenses of the business such as maintaining agencies and a force of special agents and operating a home office continue and they may form 20 per cent of all expenses It is better to receive 1 in premium although loss and expenses aggregate 105 than to receive no premium and pay 20 cents fixed expenses Continuance of all business at a loss of course must ultimately result in failure and such has been the fate of many fire insurance companies FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF COOPERATION While the contest proceeded between co6peration on the one hand represented by the associations and competition on the other represented by the antitrust and anticompact laws some states departed from the line of procedure which had previously been followed a departure which was extremely significant not merely by reason of the type of law adopted but because of the relinquishment of the principle of competition All the legislation thus far considered asserted in effect that there should be no com bination that each company should charge its own rates that competition would determine their equity Since under such con ditions two different companies might quote different rates on the same risk the states were saying in effect that there should be no measurement of hazard Rates were to approximate costs not by measurement but by competition A new era of legislation had begun in some states however Laws Requiring the Filing of Rates For example laws were passed requiring corporations doing business in the state to file a schedule of rates with a state authority and requiring uniform pre miums for all risks written under the same schedule A common expert might be employed to inspect and rate risks and advise the 186FIRE INSURANCE rates to be charged9 These are important simply as examples of permission to cooperatively determine rates Laws Providing for Revision of Rates A second type of law required the filing of rates with the superintendent of insurance and invested him with power to order changed excessive unreasonable or inadequate rates Schedules and local tariffs were to be open to the inspection of the public and local agents were required to exhibit copies of the same An appeal from the decision of the superintendent respecting rates might be taken to the district courts of the state20 These laws made it illegal to give special rates on any property not given to other property of equal hazard or to discriminate between persons The title of one for example was An act relating to fire insurance and providing for the regula tion and control of rates of premium thereon and to prevent dis crimination therein The state is now on the road toward acknowl edging the good features of co6peration it realizes that a company should not discriminate between two equal risks and there only remains to be recognized the absurdity of two companies differing in rates on the same risk The objectionable feature of the law to the companies was the extreme power seemingly vested in the insurance commissioner This phase of the subject is discussed later State Rating Acts Legislation of a more radical type speedily followed the laws providing for revision of rates in the form of acts which create state commissions with power to actually fix rates in the first instance which shall be charged by the companies The most noteworthy example of such a law is that of Texas2 In the words of the Insurance Commissioner of Texas22 If the state has the final say in the ratemaking business then I see no reason why the state should not make the rate in the first instance We have state made rates for fire insurance companies We have a regular factory for making these fire insurance rates The employes in that factory devote their entire time and attention to the study of the ratemaking business We have very experi enced men employed in the department about twentyfive in number there 9 See e g Arkansas Laws 1913 Act 159 20Kansas e g Laws 1909 Chap 152 u Texas Laws 1910 2 National Convention of Insurance Commissioners September 1915 p 162 187THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY being appropriated 100000 annually for the payment of the expenses of making rates An act enabling similar action in Kentucky was the cause of considerable difficulty in 1912 which will be referred to later Criticism of State Rating Acts The dissatisfaction of the com panies with the Kansas act providing for a revision of rates by the insurance commissioner afforded an opportunity for the most important of recent decisions affecting fire insurance rates23 The law was attacked in the courts on the ground that fire insurance was a business of a private nature and that the law consequently was unconstitutional amounting to an interference with the right of private contract guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment The majority decision held that a business by circumstances and its nature may rise from private to be of public concern and be subject in consequence to governmental regulation  Contracts of insurance therefore have greater public consequence than contracts between individuals to do or not to do a particular thing whose effect stops with the individuals It is therefore within the principle we have announced 24 The act in question was consequently held to be a valid exercise of the police power of the state A strong dissenting opinion deplored the possi bility so created of opening the way to state pricefixing with respect to many other kinds of articles and service But the acts which provided for rates actually made by the state occasioned the greatest consternation in the insurance fra ternity the results of which were most strongly evidenced in the case of Kentucky where such a law was passed in 1912 After suggesting that this power be given to the Insurance Commissioner rather than to a state commission the companies threatened to withdraw from the state in a body By March 9 1914 twenty companies are reported to have withdrawn and by March 10 fortyseven companies had left the state Meanwhile several events had concretely illustrated the prime necessity of fire insur ance A 150000 fire occurred at Hodgensville in which twenty three buildings were destroyed while covered by only 50000 insurance

how much insurance was carried by their borrowers how much matured each month and what arrangements for its renewal had been made Loans were outstanding on storage receipts representing alcoholic liquor in bond to the amount of approximately 162000000 The banks desired these loans liquidated if further insurance could not be obtained Commercial credit was restricted by banks whole salers and manufacturers25 The pressure by business interests was so great that it was necessary to hold a conference to determine upon concessions which would enable the companies to resume business and in June 1914 an agreement to the following effect was reached 1 Suit would be entered to test the constitutionality of the law and the Insurance Board would not enforce the provisions of the act until the question of constitutionality had been decided by the courts 2 a committee should be appointed to make a study of rate laws with a view to formulating legislation on this subject 3 all companies which had withdrawn from the state were to be permitted to resume business there without penalty 4 rates would be reduced by the companies Actuarial Bureau wherever improvements were made and 5 a Business Mens Com mittee guaranteed the faithful execution of the agreement The companies accordingly returned to Kentucky and the Circuit Court on June 12 held the act to be unconstitutional The following arguments have been advanced as showing the inadvisability of a state rating law Some of them also apply to laws permitting the state to revise rates 1 They interfere with freedom of contract in a business which is of a private and not a public nature 2 It is unfair for the state to limit the amount which the com panies may collect in premiums without guaranteeing them against loss 3 It is unfair to require the companies to contribute by taxa tion to a state rating board which may be of no benefit to them or 26 See the insurance periodicals of this period for instance the United States

more costly than their own private method of fixing rates 4 Political influence may exert a power In this connection the words of the insurance commissioner of a state where a rating law is in force are interesting The law should be framed so as to eliminate politics from the board If they can keep politics out of the board in my opinion the system will be a success 26 5 State management is usually inefficient This argument often merely a broad assertion may be dismissed immediately as being no more applicable to insurance than any other subject even if true which is open to question 6 The inequalities and lack of relation present in state and local taxation afford a presumption that the fire tax will be improp erly distributed under the states supervision 7 If the state assumed entire control of the business it could not accomplish its objects judging from the failure of state insur ance in other countries to reduce rates or yield a profit What can be accomplished then by merely fixing rates except to make the companies bear the unjust burden of any losses which may result 8 Average and distribution are bases of fire insurance and rates cannot be correctly or safely fixed without them Rates should therefore not be founded on the experience of a single state Never theless the city of Austin Texas appealed to the State Insurance Board for a reduction of rates on the ground that the rates of Austin should be fixed upon the citys own experience and that citizens of Austin should not be taxed to pay for fire losses elsewhere A statement of a state fire insurance commission claims the following advantages for a state rating law 1 The elimination of discriminations in favor of the large insurer and in favor of certain localities and classes of risks 2 A reduction in insurance rates a By improvements in cities causing reductions in their key rates b By improvements in individual risks c By the removal of unnecessary hazards and the reduc tion of hazards necessary to the risk d By elimination of faults of management 26 John S Patterson Texas Nat Conw of Ins Commissioner September 1915 p 163 190FIRE INSURANCE e By preventing insurance companies from advancing rates when temporary conditions and bad losses in certain localities make them desire to do so 3 Stability of rates and schedules and accessibility of informa tion regarding the process of ratemaking Several obvious comments may be made regarding these claims The desirability of the elimination of discrimination cannot be disputed nor the ability of the state to accomplish this denied Improvements in cities in individual risks and in conditions sur rounding risks however could and did take place before the state rating system was ever in effect The rating schedules used by the companies provided allowances for such improvements With reference to the success in preventing rate advances it is hard to see any equity in preventing advances in rates if such advances are justified Information regarding ratemaking however is due the public and it is unfortunate that fire insurance rating bureaus local boards and associations did not sooner realize the necessity of a campaign of education The principal advantages of the state rating acts were that they fully admitted the necessity of having but one rate for each risk thereby endeavoring to secure the same result as the advocates of co6peration and second the removal of certain evils which had existed and with which cooperation had not sufficiently developed to cope But it is also evident that the possibility exists in state rating laws for evils fully as serious as those which are removed especially political corruption ignoring the principle of average and inadequate rates It is therefore legitimate to inquire whether equally great benefits might not be obtained from legislation of another character Regulative Statutes At about the time state rating acts were being considered in Texas and Kentucky a New York legislative committee transmitted a report recommending that the companies be allowed to continue cooperative rating under the regulation of the state and in 1911 a law was passed with the following important provisions 27 1 Corporations associations and bureaus for suggesting 27 New York Laws 1909 as amended by Laws of 1911 Chap 460 and Laws 1912 Chap 175 191THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY approving or making rates to be used by more than one underwriter are required to a File with the insurance commissioner their articles of agreement bylaws and a statement of the names and addresses of members b Submit to supervision and examination by the insurance commissioner at his discretion and at least triennially c File rates and schedules at the request of the commis sioner d Keep records of proceedings and furnish the insured with information as to his rate and a copy of the schedule by which the same is computed e Provide means for hearing interested parties before the proper committees 2 Associations and bureaus are prohibited from a Discriminating in rates the commissioner may hear cases and order discriminations removed b Requiring that all insurance be purchased from members of such organizations c Requiring that rates quoted depend upon the placing of the whole or a specified part of insurance at such rates A certain degree of progress in state action is apparent in legis lation of this nature which permits co6peration by insurers with its attendant advantages and on the other hand prohibits and adopts means to eliminate the abuses which have existed In 1913 two other states North Carolina28 and West Virginia29 passed laws identical with that of New York although North Carolina has since added a provision for a hearing and examination of rates and a decision regarding their fairness leaving correction to be accomplished by force of public opinion But even more impor tant has been the endorsement by the National Convention of Insurance Commissioners of the idea of regulated co6peration One of its committees after an investigation came to the con clusions that 1 Rates were at present made co6peratively 2 This co6peration exists in

antimonopoly antitrust and anticom pact laws looking toward unrestricted and open competition As a result of its investigation the committee submitted for adoption throughout the United States six model acts30 as follows 1 An act similar to the New York law just described providing for supervision and examination of rating bureaus 2 An act prohibiting discrimination in rates and any require ment that the whole or any part of a risk be placed with certain companies 3 An act requiring companies to maintain and coSperate with a public rating bureau with equitable apportionment of expenses and equal voice in its actions 4 An act requiring a written survey of each risk specifically rated by schedule Two other bills favored by a number of the committee mem bers were not adopted by the committee as a whole viz 5 Prohibiting agreements between companies except such as are permitted by law and 6 Authorizing the insurance commissioner to review rates and correct the same subject to court review The latter two acts are in the nature of concessions to existing legislation and as such a compromise with the principle of coSpera tion with regulation A report to the National Convention in April 191531 indicated that the first of these laws was in existence prior to 1915 in six states and was enacted in three additional states by April 1915 Laws prohibiting discrimination

Maryland Nevada New Mexico North Dakota Ohio Philippines Porto Rico Rhode Island Utah Vermont Virginia Wyoming RESULTS OF REGULATIVE LEGISLATION The tendency during the past two years has been unmistak ably toward a type of legislation which recognizes the difficulties of state ratemaking and on the other hand shows appreciation of the iight of the public to be protected from arbitrary action and unnec essary inequity The advantages of a statute combining the prin ciples of private cooperation and public regulation may be most concretely shown by a review of the results where such a law has actually been in existence35 One of the oldest laws of this nature is that of New York passed in 1911 after a very thorough investi gation of fire insurance conditions This state thereby became the leader in this kind of fire insurance legislation as it was in certain phases of life insurance legislation some years ago The results of its activity were as follows 1 As shown by the map on page 177 four ratemaking asso ciations operate now and have for some time operated in New York state One of the results of delegating the power of supervision to the superintendent of insurance was to bring about cooperation and harmony of action among these associations While the first impulse in this direction came from the state the associations readily re sponded and brought about many reforms on their own initiative Frequent meetings of managers of the respective associations resulted in the adoption and promulgation of uniform rules prac tices and forms Thus the conditions were removed which occa sioned the statement by an investigator in 1913 that no one person is familiar with all these rules and until recently there has been no systematic attempt to collate them 36 2 Along with the former diversity of rules went nonuniformity in rates A second beneficial result of the work of supervision has been to gradually eliminate inconsistency in premium charges Variance between rates on risks of the same degree of hazard but 35 A considerable portion of the data for the following statements was ob tained from a letter to the author by Hon J L Phillips Superintendent of Insur ance of New York 36 See Fire Underwriters Associations in the United States pp 41 42 196FIRE INSURANCE located in the jurisdiction of different rating associations inequali ties in rates charged by the same association on similar risks in different portions of its territory and unjust distinctions between different classes of risks were all considerably remedied It is stated that it was not necessary to make frequent application of the power vested in the superintendent of insurance its mere existence accom plishing the desired results in most cases 3 As has been previously stated co6peration has been a status favorable to the development of a science of fire rating one of the most important phases of which development was the supersedence of judgment rating by schedule rating The New York law has encouraged this Dwelling and farm schedules have been de vised with the resultant advantages of schedule rating all of which cannot be enumerated here37 It is sufficient to say that thereby discrimination is more surely detected and avoided and property owners are made more fully aware of the deficiencies of their property Thus the law seemingly offers no check to the preventive and protective functions of the associations 4 To some degree the law has resulted in satisfying the well nigh universal desire for lower rates During the first few years the orders to remove unfair discriminations resulted in a considerable saving in premium to an amount suggested by careful estimates as 1000000 per annum In many cases the removal of discrimina tions resulted in readjustments which lowered some rates and advanced others without extensively reducing the total premium income obtained on the class as a whole Unascertainable saving in premiums resulted also from owners remedying property defects which were indicated CONCLUSION In many directions the legislators have sought a method of removing unsatisfactory conditions among the agencies engaged in fire insurance rating sometimes recognizing the fundamental prin ciples governing the business of furnishing indemnity but often ignoring or being ignorant of such principles The statutes passed and considered have been prompted by a variety of motives and have had a variety of effects but there is faintly discernible in early years and distinctly apparent in later years a tendency to 37 See F C Moores Universal Mercantile Schedule p 8 197THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY recognize in a measure the benefits of co6peration The com panies as well as legislators and officials have made mistakes but many in both groups seem now to see a method of procedure which affords a solution of the difficulty One of the principal agencies of late years in bringing about a more rational treatment of the problem involved has been the National Convention of Insurance Commissioners which at first encouraged the study of public questions and recently has made some progress toward concerted state action the necessity for which is shown by the variety of laws in the preceding table Perhaps through this association some of the inconsistencies of legislation may be removed Eliminating from consideration state insurance which is not yet seriously considered as a general method of procedure but rather as a last resource not yet required by the exigencies of the case and the problem of acquiring uniformity of state action a partial answer to which is furnished by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners two phases of the question of what agency shall make fire insurance rates are apparent 1 Shall competition or cooperation be admitted as the basis for ratemaking This question appears to have been answered in favor of co6peration This paper has attempted to outline the history of the conflict between these two ideas to indicate the reasons for the ineffectiveness of legislation intended to enforce competition and to show that a second and different problem has now appeared 2 Is the public interest better served by allowing the insurers to fix rates under regulatory statutes or by delegating pricefixing powers to state officials under state rating acts This question has not become a distinctly recognized issue because it is possible in the United States for two radically different methods of regulation to exist for some time in different sections of the country without any definite decision in favor of either It is probable however that in the near future the lastmentioned problem will become one of the most important in fire insurance 198

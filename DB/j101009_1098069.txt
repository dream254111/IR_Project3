estate and not a sole trader seems to be as completely under disability to contract sue and be sued as if chapter 103 of the Code had never been enacted Not a syllable appears in the entire chapter purporting to enlarge her capacity to contract sue and be sued that does not ex clusively apply to a separate trader or the owner of a separate estate under this chapter Section 2288 authorizes a married woman who is not a trader to contract only in respect to    her said separate estate or upon the faith and credit thereof and only upon such contracts   relating to or affecting such  separate estate she may sue and be sued Section 2295 limits section 2288 by designating what particular estate she may bind or contract with reference to By the latter section she is permitted to con tract sue and be sued with reference to all matters touching her said estate which is made her separate under this chapter as if she were unmarried Sec tion 2295 declares expressly that all such contracts shall be deemed to have been made with reference to not only her said separate estate under this chapter but also with reference to her equitable separate estate if any she has It follows therefore agreeable to the old maxim Expressio unius alterius est exclusio if she possesses no such separate estate she could make no contract with reference thereto or upon the faith and credit thereof and her efforts to do so would be unauthorized and void and could not be the foundation of any suit by or against her under this chapter Not being authorized to charge her person she can only charge her estate in possession with her contracts would not therefore the value of the estate which she is allowed to charge fix the extent of her liability upon her contracts This proposition would hardly be denied by any but for section 2289 which presents some difficulties It appears to direct that a personal judgment or decree may be entered upon a contract which is not personal in the sense of binding the person It provides for the rendition of personal judgments or decrees upon such contracts as she is authorized by section 2288 to make which judgments or decrees may be enforced against her and any separate estate she may have or subsequently ac quire Unquestionably the legislature may relieve a married woman of all legal disa bilities imposed by the common law and authorize her to make any manner of contracts sue and be sued as if she were unmarried But can the legislature or the courts give life to a contract which she is not first personally authorized to make If she be not expressly authorized by statute to bind her person or her future estate directly could any act of the legislature or the court afterward so change its character as to give it an effect which she herself could not have done directly  But does section 2289 change the nature or character of the contract which she is authorized to make by sections 2288 2295 so as to bind her person or so enlarge them as to enable her to create present liability on the faith of future ac quisitions Are not her contracts still in the nature of liabilities in rem and not in personam the extent of which must still be measured by the value of her estate1899 CORRESPONDENCE 631 in possession at the time they are made and upon which she could only have ob tained the credit Then if section 2289 only authorizes judgments and decrees to be entered upon such contracts as married women are under section 2288 enabled to make based upon separate estite acquired under chapter 103 of the Code does it not necessa rily follow that the amount of the judgment or decree must not exceed the value of the estate which she is by section 2295 allowed to contract with reference to or obtain credit upon the faith of Then we conclude that if a married woman is possessed of no estate made her separate estate by chapter 103 of the Code she could make no legal contract which could be enforced by a court of law If she does own such separate estate to the value of 1000 she may contract upon the faith and credit thereof and may en dorse her husbands note for 5000 but as she could only charge her said estate by her endorsement the holder of the note could only take a judgment thereon for 1000 thc value of the estate upon the faith of which she made the endorse ment or obtained the credit This judgment for 1000 could thereafter be en forced against her or any separate estate she has or may subsequently acquire Respectfully Bristol VaTenn J S ASHWORTH SCIRE FACIASSTATUTE OF LIMITATIONS Editor Virginia Law Register In the December 1898 number of your most valuable journal p 512 com menting upon Fadeleys Admr v Williams Admr in which our Supreme Court held that the stay law Va Code sec 3577  only applies to writs of fieri facias and not to writs of scire facias you very justly say  But it seems to us that the court had already ruled otherwise in James v Life 92 Va 702 and conclude The two cases would seem inconsistent The late ase construes the saving clause of section 3577 literally and confines it to writ fieri facias the earlier extends it to suits in equity to revive and enforce judgments upon which no fieri facias can be issued I was counsel for Mrs James in James v Life and beg the privilege of present ing to the profession so much of my printed note in that appeal as raised this ques tion which will accentuate the inconsistency of the two decisions I concur with you in saying they seem to be irreconcilable The extract from my note in James v Life on this point is as follows  Does Section 3577 Apply  This section provides limitations of proceedings to enforce a judgment and mentions executions scire facias etc and extends the operation of the stay law from January 1 1869 to March 29 1871 specifically and exclusively to writs of fieri facias Under section 2919 which is applicable to all civil rights and remedies the period from March 2 1866 to January 1 1869 was excluded but this had no effect because this judgment was not recovered until June 3 1870 Now by sec tion 3577 as to the right to issue a writ of fieri facias upon this judgment it was expressly provided that the period up to March 29 1871 was also to be excluded But this does not apply to a suit in equity nor to a scirefacias When Dr James died on August 14 1889 the right to a fieri facias died with him until and except

ground of equity jurisdiction has been removed by giving the assignee the legal ti tle28 If this be true the federal courts of equity undoubtedly have been deprived of their former jurisdiction by a state statute chang ing the substantive law On the other hand where the assignee is merely given the right to sue in a court of law in his own name it is believed that the federal courts are not thereby deprived of their equity jurisdiction because the assignee still has only the equi table title even though the statute be expressly exclusive or con strued by the state courts to be so The modern married womens statutes removing the wifes commonlaw disabilities furnish a similar familiar example of statutes depriving the equity courts of their former jurisdiction by providing a complete and adequate remedy at law It is unconditionally conceded that a state statute can not ex pressly and directly change the modes and forms of procedure of the federal courts of equity Neither can such a statute with the express purpose enlarge nor restrict the jurisdiction of these courts Yet it can not be doubted that the materials upon which the federal jurisdiction operates are proper subjects of state legis lation and that changes in the substantive structure of rights may have important effect upon the method of judicial enforcement or administration And in cases not inherently of exclusive equitable cognizance but where the right to resort thereto rests upon an in adequacy of the remedy at law it would seem that a legislative act of the state making the remedy adequate would under some cir cumstances result in a loss of jurisdiction in equity So the doc trine that a state can neither define nor regulate the equity jurisdic tion of the courts of the United States should not be taken too broadly29 The validity of state statutes then to oust or enlarge the equitable jurisdiction of the federal courts seems to depend more upon their purpose and the nature of the subject which they affect than upon the ultimate effects which they produce WORKMENS COMPENSATION ACTSACCIDENTS ARISING OUT OF AND IN THE COURSE OF THE EMPLOYMENTFrom a considera tion of the very nature of Workmens Compensation Acts and the reasons for adopting them and from all principles of right and justice it is clear that the employer cannot be compelled to com pensate a workman for the loss of his earning capacity or the de pendents for the loss of the dead employees support unless the loss was caused by and due to the employment Therefore the clause in the act which defines the injuries for which compensation must be given is of the utmost importance And while such in juries are variously defined in some of the states which have adopted Workmens Compensation Acts the almost universal phrase 8 See Cummings v Norris 25 N Y 625 Cottle v Cole  Cole 20 Iowa 481  See Union Pacific Ry Co v Board of Commissioners supra 232is the one borrowed by the majority of the American acts from the English Workmens Compensation Acts This limits the injuries for which compensation can be recovered to those by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment 1 Inasmuch as the English statute uses these words the English decisions are entitled to weight and since this branch of jurispru dence has only recently been developed to any extent in this country the English decisions will frequently be referred to in deducing the rules which govern the construction of these words2 The fundamental principle to be borne in mind in construing this phrase is that to justify an award the accident must have arisen out of as well as in the course of the employment The two are separate questions to be determined by different tests where Iboth requirements are not satisfied an award under the statute is not proper3 In the course of points to the time place and cir cumstances under which the accident occurs while the words out of confine the accidents to those where the employment was the origin or cause4 But these acts should be interpreted broadly5 Of the two tests which must in every case be satisfied the broad est is that which refers to in the course of the employment and that requirement is much easier satisfied and gives less difficulty than the one requiring the accident to arise out of the employ ment An accident is said to take place in the course of the employment when the injured employee is doing what a man so employed may reasonably do within the time he is employed and at a place where he may reasonably be during the time6 How ever in the course of does not mean simply that time during which the employee is actually engaged in doing the work the em ployer hires him to perform7 But it seems that there are two very important restrictions namely what the employee is doing must be something that is necessarily incident to the work he is Act 1897 60  61 Vict c 37 s 1 subs 1 2 Ryalls v Mechanics Mills 150 Mass 190 22 N E 766 5 L R A 667 In re Employers

233VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW hired to perform and he must not unnecessarily increase the danger beyond that contemplated by the contract of employment8 As we have already seen the injuries arising out of the em ployment are those in which the employment is the origin or cause9 In other words there must be a causal connection between the em ployment and the injury10 The test laid down by the English cases and which seems to have Leen followed in this country as to whether or not an injury is one arising out of the employment is Did the injury result from a risk which it could reasonably be seen at the time the in jured employee entered into the employment the employment sub jected him to or in other words was the risk incidental to the em ployment If it was such a risk the accident arose out of the employment but if it was not the accident was one for which no compensation could be recovered11 These tests are properly applied in the recent case of Western Indemnity Co v Pillsbury Cal 151 Pac 398 Here a foreman of a gang of laborers after reprimanding a certain Greek laborer for his method of work and showing him the correct method without avail ordered him to put down his shovel and quit work The Greek refused and the foreman in endeavoring to take the shovel from him was thrown down by the Greek who inflicted severe lacerations on him with his teeth from which blood poison ing resulted The court held that the injury was one arising out of and in the course of his employment and upheld an award giv ing him compensation It can readily be seen in accordance with the rules stated that the character of the men which the injured employee was employed to direct was such that rough and inju rious treatment at their hands was an incident of the employment It is even held that the tortious acts of third persons strangers to the employment are a risk incidental to the employment if it is shown that it is reasonably probable that the employee will be ex posed to such risks12 This is clearly true when the tortious acts are directed against him as an employee and because of the em ployment13 In fact the courts go so far as to hold the accident s Spooner v The Detroit Saturday Night Co Mich 157 N E 657 The deceased was employed solely to operate an engine and dynamo Which was in the basement and which he had no occasion to leave He went upstairs on foot to visit some men and as a friendly act started to take them farther up in an elevator and was killed Held the accident did not arise in the course of the employment Rayner v Sligh Furniture Co supra See

extracted from the adjudicated cases in this state appears to be that when the accident is the result of a risk rea sonably incident to the employment it is an accident arising out of the employment Armitage v L  Y Ry Co 1902 2 K B 178 Challis v London  S W Ry Co 1905 2 K B 154  Challis v London  S W Ry Co supra In re Employers Liability Assurance Co supra Nisbit v Rayne  Bunn 1910 2 K B 689 234NOTES is within the statute even though it is caused by the playful act of a fellow workman and is in no way in furtherance of the work14 Furthermore according to the English cases the causa proxima of the accident must be looked into by the court and if it is seen that the conditions of the employment were the proximate cause of the injury the employee will be entitled to compensation although some disability of the employee made him more susceptible to in jury than the average workman This view repudiates the view that the employer is not liable for the remote consequences of the disability which the workman brings with him and bases its con clusion on the assumption that a man always brings some disability with him Sometimes it is old age and sometimes it is of a more serious nature but nevertheless it does not relieve the employer of liability15 It is doubtful if the American courts go as far as this to hold the employer liable for injuries due to remote disabil ities of the employee16 And to further illustrate the reasoning of the courts in regard to the construction of this phrase it is interesting to note that if the place and circumstances in which the workman is employed involve a greater than ordinary risk of some particular danger as lightning for example such an injury may be considered as caused by an accident arising out of his employment although it may not be con nected with or have any relation to the work the employee was doing17 It is not purposed to go into the question of what cir cumstances amount to an accident but the expression is used in the Workmans Compensation Acts in the popular and ordinary sense of the word as denoting any unforeseen and untoward event pro ducing personal harm RIGHT OF THE ASSIGNEE OF THE DISTRIBUTIVE SHARE OF

work man employed in unloading coal from a ship who was required in the course of his duty to stand by the open hatchway through which the coal was being brought up from the hold was seized with an epileptic fit while at work and fell into the hold and was thereby seriously in jured It was held by the court that the injury arose out of and in the course of the employment 18 Milliken v A Towle

contracted thereby pneumonia from which he died It was held by the court that this was not an injury arising out of the employment Although it was conceded that it arose in the course of the employment But see In re Brightman Mass 107 N E 527 17 Andrew v Failsworth Industrial Society 1914 2 K B 32 235

added a sketch of the life led by the suspects in exile This occu pies the middle of the volume which opens with an account of the constitutional development of Russiaif it can be called development when nearly all the movement has been backwards and it is followed by a dry though useful descrip tion of the educational system of the country written with a view to show its utter inadequacy Stepniak whose recent articles in the London Times on the present state of the Russian army are full of interest possesses a talent for describing scenes of suffering and woe which would have made his or her fortune if turned into the profit able channel of sensational novelwriting But this same faculty prejudices his reader against him as the truthful narrator of scenes in actual life and one puts the book down with a feeling that after all the author has been trifling with his sympathies JOHNSONS SURVEYING THE method of ascertaining distances and ele vations by means of the engineers transit instru ment and stadiawhere the apparent length on a staff intercepted by two parallel wires in a teles cope gives the distance of the staff from the instrument and the vertical angle serves to deter mine the elevationhas not as yet become well established in private surveying practice although no one who is well informed in such matters doubts its applicability to a large range of geodetic work its accuracy and convenience The use of the stadia has been confined almost altogether to the U S and state surveys The experience which Professor Johnson of Wash ington university St Louis gained while en gaged on the surveys of the great lakes and the Mississippi River has enabled him to prepare a very clear and concise manual of the operations of topographical surveying as there practised He also gives a detailed description of the work of measuring a baseline and triangulating when the survey is of moderate magnitude indeed for any work except the most important and he explains the projection of maps for large and small areas The book is well suited to the classroom and the field We should have preferred however to find his discussion of utility and universal applicability of the method placed in the introduc tion instead of the body of the text or gathered A manual of the theory and practice of topographical surveying by means of the transit and stadia including secondary

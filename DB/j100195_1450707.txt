religious truth seems to me a very dangerous argument A decorous congregation at a church might show less warmth than a Salvation Army Corps But does that prove that the doctrine of the Salvation Army is truer  Though I sit still and silent in synagogue I am not prepared to say that I have less religious warmth than a worshipper at an oldfashioned Cheder Or if he has more warmth I perhaps have more truth If some travellers are to be believed the most  religious people are neither Christians nor Jews By  religious  they mean religious to the eye and ear But this again is not a necessarily correct test of religious truth Even if Christianity with its human God did produce greater religious warmth than Judaism in the best sense of the word that is no convincing proof of its greater truth Jewish monotheism may conceivably need a greater religious capacity for all its height and depth to be realized Even if which I must deny it could be proved that the average man is more likely to feel God near with the belief in the Incarnation than without it I cannot see that this would be any rigid proof of the Incarnations truth God brings men and women to him in divers ways and fashions he makes use of half lights and illusions and errors Surely we must all admit that each for our own ends and from a different basis But to pursue this line of thought fascinating though it be would take too long and lead too far Meanwhile a Jewish reviewer cannot be too grateful for Dr Dalmans essay He cannot rate too highly his fairmindedness impartiality and friendly feeling I wish he would come to England and we would show him practically how Jews and Christians respect each other and how they work together in common service for humanity and for God C G MONTEFIORE M D CONWAYS SOLOMON Solomon and Solomonic Literature By MONCURE DANIEL CONWAY Kegan Paul Trench  Co LIKE to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices might have been adopted by Dr Conway as a motto describing the method pursued in his book As he careers gaily from one book of the Old Testament to another or to Gospels and Epistles or to Zoroaster and the ZendAvesta or to India and Vishnu and746 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Agni and Indra the critic who attempts to keep pace with him is likely to feel somewhat exhausted It may be said however at once that the book is not destitute of what is fresh stimulating and suggestive Dr Conway shows abundant facility in detecting resem blances and analogies but in order to genuine discovery the more tedious task of sifting and proving is indispensable This task he is too much inclined to disregard Our author tells us that he aims at tracing two streams of evolution one issuing from the wisdombooks the other from the lawbooks traceable in their collisions their periods of parallelism and their convergencewhere however their respective inspirations continue distinguishable like the waters of the Missouri and Mississippi after they flow between the same banks The first mentioned stream he regards as Solomonic the latter he calls Jahvist but the distinction between the one and the other is made not unfrequently in a somewhat arbitrary manner We are told that the external and historical data are insuffi cient to prove certainly that an individual Solomon ever existed  The name Solomon seems to be allegorical The name given to him by the prophet was Jedidiah  beloved of Jah  Dr Conway finds a parallel to the famous judgment of Solomon in an Oriental tale concerning a damsel of exceptional wisdom and virtue On two women laying claim to the motherhood of a child the damsel directed that they should try which was the stronger each taking hold of one of the boys hands When the child through pain should begin to cry the true mother full of compassion would let go while the false claimant would maintain her hold The false claimant was the wife the true the concubine of a certain householder on whose death possession of the house had to follow motherhood of the child But if the child had died the wife would become possessor of the house Here Dr Conway finds a motive a link missing in the Biblical narrative How after the householders death the concubine was to prove that she was really the mother of the child she had given up in its infancy he does not inform us though he thinks she would have a reason for her conduct which the true mother in the Biblical narrative has not He tells us that there appear some reasons for believing the Oriental tale to be the earlier On the next page the some reasons have expanded and we read Here then we find in ancient Indian literature a tale which may be fairly regarded as the origin of the Judgment of Solomon But it is right to say that before making this statement he refers also to a variant story in which Buddha himself appears as judge In Dr Conways opinion there is no evidence that the God of IsraelCRITICAL NOTICES 747 was known either as Jah or Jahveh in Solomons time As to how the name came into use or whence it was derived he offers no suggestion He alludes to the names of the apes and peacocks of I Kings x 22 as proving the possibility of the importation of Oriental tales from India and this intercourse with the East is certainly of no small consequence He makes repeated reference to the Queen of Sheba regarding her as a  Queen of the Seven forgetting the slight philological difficulty presented by the difference between y and M This is in the chapter on The Book of Proverbs where also we are strangely told that Nishma that is 1n  occurs only in Prov xx 27 and Job xxvi 4 Here also there are a number of quotations designed to show parallels or discrepancies between alleged Solomonic and Jahvist elements A single example must suffice Dr Conway gives as the translation of Prov xxvii 21  The fining pot for silver and the furnace for gold And a man is proved by that which he praiseth He italicizes the word  proved and compares xvii 3 The fining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold But Jahveh trieth hearts Here he says the Jahvist has made a slip by which his hand is confessed There is reason to fear that it is rather of Dr Conway himself that this may be said The Hebrew has no word for the emphatic proved What is the true sense of the somewhat obscure verse Prov xxvii 21 it is not necessary now to inquire With regard to a view of the Song of Songs now attracting a good deal of attention Dr Conway observes The theory that the book is a collection of bridal songs and that the mention of Solomon is due to an Eastern custom of designating the bridegroom and bride as Solomon and Queen Shulamith during their honeymoon does not seem consistent with the fact that in several allusions to Solomon his royal state is slighted whereas only compliments would be paid to a bridegroom The book is looked upon by our author as consisting of several songs of different degrees of antiquity giving collectively the impression of a romance conveyed in idylls each presenting a picturesque situation or a scene the general theme and motif being that of the great Solomonic Psalm that is the fortyfifth The treatment of Ecclesiastes is scanty and inadequate This is remarkable in a work dedicated as is that before us to the Omar Khayyam Club It was the late Dean Plumptre who at considerable748 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW length traced a parallelism between Ecclesiastes and the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam whom he designated a Persian Koheleth of the twelfth century With regard to the riddle of the name Koheleth or Qoheleth as some writers give it Dr Conway says Renan has shown conclusively as I think that the signature on this book QHLT is a mere letterplay on the word Solomon Now what does Renan say on the page of his Histoire du Peuple dIsragl to which reference is made nrinp est certainement un equivalent de 3WSalomo par un jeu analogue I lathbasch ou lalbam On nen a pas encore trouvg le secret Yet this is what Dr Conway regards as conclusive proof Our author kicks at the very comprehensive dictum All is vanity This is an addition of the Jahvist There are some things which Koheleth finds not vanityyouth and wedded love and work that is congenial Such a statement as this needs no refutation But as to congenial work it would almost seem that Dr Conway has not read the second chapter of the book Of Ecclesiasticus we learn for the first time that it is the book of reconciliation between Solomonism and Jahvismor as we should now say between philosophy and theology It is the antidote to Ecclesiastes What is said on the Wisdom of Solomon appears more suitable and pertinent but it would take too long to attempt a full discussion The chapters on  The Epistle to the Hebrews as a Sequel to Wisdom on  Solomon Melchizedek and what follows it might be scarcely desirable to discuss even if space permitted There are some incidental notices which are not without interest as of the Banquet which at South Place Chapel was substituted for the Eucharist and which it seems was attended by Leigh Hunt Mill Thomas Campbell Jerrold and some distinguished ladies In the chapter on Ecclesiastes there is an account of a conversation between Tennyson and Maurice taken from an American magazine Speaking of Ecclesiastes Tennyson said it was the one book the admission of which into the canon he could not understand it was so utterly pessimisticof the earth earthy Maurice fired up Yes if you leave out the last two verses So long as you look only down upon earth all is vanity of vanities But if you look up there is a God the judge of good and evil Tennyson said he would think over the matter from that point of view Tennyson we are told moreover was curiously unconscious of his own pessimism He is reported to have  said to Tyndall that if he knew there was no future life he would regard the creator of human beings as a demon and shake his fist in his eternal face Supposing this to be true it tends to show if evidence were needed that distinguishedCRITICAL NOTICES 749 poets can say very foolish things Corroborative testimony to some extent is furnished by In Memoriam CXX where after expressing the opinion  I think we are not wholly brain the poet in the next stanza proceeds Not only cunning casts in clay Let Science prove we are and then What matters Science unto men At least to me I would not stay The last words evidently express a conditional purpose to commit suicide And suicide from one point of view would be regarded no doubt as shaking ones fist in the face of the Eternal But with respect to the genuineness of the closing verses of Ecclesiastes Maurice was undoubtedly right It has been justly said that without these verses the book must be regarded as aimless THOMAS TYLER STREANES ECCLESIASTES Ecclesiastes or the Preacher Explained by ANNESLEY W STREANE DD Methuen  Co THIS commentary forms part of a series entitled The Church mans Bible and designed it would appear to include eventually the whole of the Biblical books The General Preface informs us that while taking into account the latest results of critical research it is intended to be of service to the general reader in the practical and devotional study of Holy Scripture The design thus set forth we need not discuss nor is it necessary to express an opinion as to whether additional commentaries conducted in accordance therewith are really wanted This is a matter for the authors the general editor and the publishers We are here concerned with Dr Streanes Commentary on Ecclesiastes as giving  results of critical research In answer to the question which is likely to be first suggested What opinion does he express with regard to the date of Ecclesiastes  the following quotations may be made The tone of the book and the character of its teaching not only suggest the period when the Persian Empire had been overthrown and Alexander the Greats successors had established Greek culture throughout the civilized world but also bear distinct traces of Stoic and Epicurean philosophy in particular of Epicurean philosophy

United States has undergone within the last half century has brought into the fore ground the question how to accelerate the expansion of our foreign commerce The reason why this question was until recently of comparatively minor importance is that problems of internal development occupied the public mind largely to the exclusion of those of external development The last half century however has been marked by material progress in the United States which is unparalleled by that of any other country with the possible exception of Germany A few comparative figures will serve to impress the true significance of this statement In 1870 the population of the United States was scarcely thirtynine millions and our combined exports and imports were valued at less than 829000000 Today however the population is almost three times that of 1870 The foreign trade has expanded at such an unprecedented rate that for the fiscal year ended June 30 1913 it was valued at 4279000000 and the exports alone amounted to 2A466000000over six times their value in 1870 During the very time that our foreign commerce has been ex periencing this phenomenal growth the export trade has been un dergoing a transformation of farreaching significance A few decades ago agricultural and other raw products formed by far the largest proportion of the foreign shipments but within recent years they have been relatively on the decrease As late as 1880 agricultural products embraced 84 per cent of the value of the exports By 1905 however the figure had fallen to 55 per cent and since that time it has suffered a further relative decrease On the other hand the proportion of manufactured and semimanufac tured goods in the export trade has within the same period ex perienced a remarkable growth In 1880 they formed but 15 per cent of the value of the foreign shipments whereas at the present day approximately 50 per cent of all the exports are ma nufactured goods and the prospect is that the figure will continue to increase for some time to come Moreover by entering a little further into details it is to be noted that in 1913 our exports of domestic manufactures including manufactures ready for consumption for further use in manufacturing and foodstuffs1915 Commercial Attaches and Foreign Trade 293 partly or wholly manufactured totalled 1506000000 or more than 60 per cent of our entire domestic exports And of this enormous figure about 50 per cent was for the sale of manufactured goods of the first two classes mentioned above So far as the exporter is concerned the significance of such a striking transformation in our export trade is not far to seek As long as agricultural and other raw products made up the larger proportion of the exports a ready market was available because foreign nations especially the European countries had a steady demand for such staple commodities In a word competition of other nations where it actually existed was comparatively easy to meet Private initiative was equal to the task of selling such goods at a fair profit so that the export trade could in a large measure look out for itself But now that manufactured goods have come to figure so prominently in foreign shipments our competition with rival nations has taken on a new form Our merchants are confronted with the not easy problem of selling manufactured goods in competition with such eminently success ful traders as for example the British and the Germans For many years these nations have been cultivating foreign markets for manufactured goods with the result that their export trade is now skilfully organized They have combined private initiative the work of commercial organizations and governmental activity in a conscious effort to make it possible to defy all comers in the international warfare for the control of foreign markets Their relatively long experience as foreign traders in manufactured goods has made it possible for them to evolve methods adapted to each particular market which are almost entirely unpracticed by many of our merchants Consequently it is now no easy matter for the American business concern to compete in many foreign markets with any large measure of success At any rate in the attempt to sell manufactured goods it is now confronted with a real and vital problem There is little wonder therefore that within the last few years several movements have been inaugurated and are now in progress whose common purpose is the solution of the problem of foreign trade expansion A recent movementone which has been accomplished only after a great deal of deliberation and effortwas the creation last July following the precedent of European governments of a corps of commercial attaches within the federal Department of Commerce The appointment of these officials marks a new and important departure by the United294 Avard Longley Bishop June States government in promoting the foreign trade of the nation The outbreak of the disastrous European war and the prospect of its continuance for several months longer have caused a tre mendous disruption of the worlds commerce In the readjustment of trade which is to follow the business interests of this country have scented what they believe to be a wonderful opportunity for reaching out and possessing themselves of new markets which under dissimilar conditions would be much more difficult to occupy Consequently the movement for foreign trade promotion has now unexpectedly received a new impetus And it is a matter of no mean significance that the Department of Commerce already has made several appointments to the offices in the newlycreated trade promotion service and that four of the ten attaches are assigned to South Americaa field where the opportunity for trade development is believed to be especially promising to our manufac turers and exporters as a result in part at least of somewhat extraordinary conditions resulting from the European war For many years past the federal government has in various ways been aiding in the work of developing our foreign com merce notably however through the consular service of the State Department Since the reforms of 1906 the personnel of the service has so greatly improved that the business interests of the country now recognize in the consular service a powerful ally in foreign trade extension But the duties of the consul are so varied that in many cases only a small fraction of his time may be given to matters pertaining to commerce He is in a sense the foreign representative of practically every branch of the fed eral government to say nothing of the demands made upon him from time to time by private citizens At seaports he is required to inspect the manifests of vessels clearing for the United States to see that the tariff laws are complied with He enforces quarantine regulations thus safeguarding the health of our people He must investigate the causes of shipwrecks and take over the property of stranded vessels He must answer all sorts of inquiries concerning his district relating to shipping com merce and industry He is responsible for the settlement of the estates of deceased countrymen and at times he is called upon to assume the office of a judge In a word his activities are manifold and beyond the necessity of listing here To any one who will give the matter a moments thought it must be apparent that it is entirely impracticable for our consuls to give that con1915 Commercial Attaches and Foreign Trade 295 tinuous and painstaking attention to trade investigations which is necessary to be given in order that pace may be kept with the commercial competition of aggressive foreign nations It was a recognition of this fact which prompted the appoint ment in 1905 of a corps of traveling field representatives known as commercial agents attached under the present organization to the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce in the Depart ment of Commerce At that time however the question of having a number of commercial attaches incorporated into the diplomatic service was under serious consideration In 1904 the diplomatic and consular officials of the United States were asked in an official letter to express their views on this matter Although most of the replies were favorable certain objections were raised which need not be entered into here The upshot of the whole matter was that for the time being the plan of a commercial attache service was shelved and as already indicated a number of socalled com mercial agents were appointed in their stead In no sense has their work been a duplication of that of the consul The commercial agent is employed in collecting detailed and useful information upon the one subject in which he is an expert He is selected because he is a man of broad practical experience and an expert in that particular line of American industry for which he is to study marketing conditions abroad Instead of being accredited to a particular country or stationed permanently in a definite locality he is sent out by his depart ment as occasion or opportunity may offer and he is continually changing his scene of operations with an eye single to one interest instead of attempting to make a survey of the whole field of com mercial and industrial activity This point may be illustrated by considering briefly the work of the seven commercial agents who were on duty a year ago One was in India making a study of the trade resources of that coun try with a view to preparing a handbook on India Another was in Germany collecting information for a report on byproducts of the coke oven Another was in the Orient studying the conditions of our trade in textiles with the Far Eastern countries and with instructions to follow up his investigations along similar lines in England Still another was in the Orient investigating markets for American canned goods and was under orders to continue his studies later in Europe A fifth agent was in Africa looking into the question of markets for cotton goods South America was the296 Avard Longley Bishop June Scene of operations of a sixth agent who was preparing a report upon markets for drugs chemicals dental supplies surgical in struments etc And by special arrangement the seventh com mercial agent was located temporarily in Washington preparing a handbook on the trade of South America It should be said in passing that these reports are published by the Department of Commerce and are widely circulated It is pretty generally recognized that these officials have per formed a very valuable function in American business during the ten years of their activities The fact is however that the com mercial agent service of our government is but slightly developed as compared with the extent to which our European commercial rivals have availed themselves respectively of the services of similar officials in the promotion of their foreign trade This is an important reason why so many business men and others are in favor of increasing our available force of commercial agents notwithstanding the recent addition of the commercial attache service to our governmental tradepromoting machinery It is perhaps to Secretary Redfield more than to any one else that credit should be given for bringing into actual existence our commercial attache service Early in 1913 his plans for hroadeningthe work of the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Com merce were first made public at a meeting of the National Cotton Textile Manufacturers Association About the same time while being interviewed by the editor of The Nations Business he out lined a similar program and showed what might be done by the Department of Commerce the headsbip of which he had but re cently assumed to increase its usefulness to the business interests of the country In discussing in this connection the possibilities of the commercial attache service he pointed out that it would stand in much the same relation to commerce as the military and naval attache service does to military and naval affairs The general plan received at once the hearty endorsement of the press and the business mens organizations throughout the country The Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America through its special committee on the Department of Commerce already was carrying on a careful study of the ways and means of making the department of greater service to the com mercial interestsof the nation As a matter of fact the federal Chamber of Commercebhas from its very beginning been in close touch with the Department of Commerce It was understood1915 Commercial Attaches and Foreign Trade 297 that Secretary Redfield was mluch interested in the Bureau of Foreign and Dornestic Commerce consequently the special comn ittee concentrated its study upon the needs and possibilities of this particular bureau Conferences were held between the eleven itmembers of the special comimittee and Secretary Redfield on June M3 and September 23 1913 with the result that the commiittee was able to report to the directors of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America a plan of extension which was es sentially in harmony with the ideas of Secretary Redfield Without entering into a detailed consideration of this report it may be stated that the following were the chief recommendations A corps of commercial attaches should be created within the De partment of Commerce and accredited to American legations ap pointments and promQtions in the commercial attache service should be under civil service law the force of commercial agents should not only be retained but it should be miiaterially increased one such agent should be assigned regularly to Central America and the West Indies and several should be appointed to bring up to date such inform iation bearing upon South America as was already in the hands of the Department of Commierce to avoid friction and delay there should be appointed a clearing connlmit tee which would be composed of representatives of the State De partment and of the Department of Commerce whose duty it should be to examine immediately upon arrival reports fromt foreign representatives of our government and to separate diplo inatic from consular information there should be an increased ap propriation for the consular service sufficient to enable when neces sary the cabling to Washington of important business informa tion the department also should keep in its employ an adequate corps of translators so that the substance of documents written in foreign languages inight be placed in the hands of American exporters and other interested parties in an intelligent form and without delay It should now be remembered that one of the chief functions of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America is to act as a national clearing house for business opinion The means which it has devised for testing the business sentiment of the country upon important matters which would be affected by legis lation is the referendum vote Here then was to be found the necessary machinery for ascertaining the feeling of the constituent comnmlxercial organizations throughout the country upon the general298 Avard Longley Bishop June plan of reorganization of Secretary Redfield as reflected in the recommendations of the Special Committee of the National Chami ber of Commerce Accordingly a referendumn was taken and the results anniounced late in December 1913 There was almost a unanimous vote in favor of the recominendations for out of 627 votes cast 624 were recorded in the affirmative Here was conclusive evidence for Secretary Redfield and other interested parties that the business interests of the country as represented ill tlle Federal Chamber of Commerce were overwhelmningly in favor of the abovemientioned plan for broadening tlle scope of the De partment of Comnmerce and were enthusiastic for the appointment of commiercial attaches as an advailced step in Amserican foreigr trade promotion Accordingly in his first annual report as head of the Depart ment of Commerce Secretary Redfield recommuended that Congress appropriate for tlle year 1915 the suim of 150000 to carry out the plan for a commercial attache service and on July 15 1914 tlle sum of 100000 was set aside for this purpose Moore specif ically it was provided that there should be creacted commnercial attaches to be appointed by the Secretary of Cormmerce after examination to be held under his direction to deternminie their competency and to be accredited through the State Department whose duties shall be to investigate and report uponi such conditions in the manufacturing industries and trade of foreigni countries as may be of ilnterest to the United States    Such commercial attaches shall serve directly under the Secretary of Commerce and shall report directly to him A plan of examimimation was soon arranged by the Secretary of Commierce oni a basis of harmonious cooperation with the Civil Service Commission It was provided that there should be both a written and ain oral exainination each counting equally Tbe written test called for the preparation of a series of short theses on various subjects bearing directly upon the work which a conmmercial attache would be called ulpon to undertalke Among these topics were the following special difficulties in export trade inethods of promloting export trade nmanufacturing and banking conditions ill the Uniited States in relation to export trade Also the can didate was required to write a thesis of 500 words in French German or Spanish on some topic intimately related to business affairs Those who succeeded in passing this examination with a imiark above 70 per cent and whose credentials showed that their1915 Comzmercial A ttaches and Foreign Trade 299 education and businiess experience would justify further considera tion by the examiners were requested to present themselves before a board composed of officers of the Bureau of Foreigni and Domestic Commerce the Civil Service Commiission and the State Department Trhis was for the express purpose of making a test of ability to speak fluently one of the prescribed foreign languages and of mnaking a careful estimate of personiality and other qualifica tionls wvlhlich an appointee to the colmmllercial attache service should possess Ill less thani tlhree months after Congress had provided the necessary legislation seven commrnercial attaches having fulfilled the requiremenits according to the mnethod of selection iindicated were appointed and before the end of October 1914 the announce mletnt was miiade of the filling of two additional posts The tenth appointment was made about two months later That the ser vice is Inot in politics at its inception but that men of excellent qualifications have been chosen for their respective positioiis is attested by a brief analysis of the list of appointments For the important position of commercial attache at London there was called the chief of the Bureau of Foreign and Doimestic CoimImierce Since 1884 this official has had wide experience in the governmient service He has been connected wiith the Depart ieiit of Commerce since 1909 and is thoroughly familiar with every aspect of trade promotion as carried on both by coinniercial organizations and the federal government At Paris the represen tative is a man who has carried on graduate study in economics and political science at some of the European universities has taught subjects within the same fields in American universities andl has been an expert investigator in Europe for our governmeint on various questions pertaining to labor conditions wages and cost of production The appointee at Berlin is a mechanical engineer wlho has been engaged in various lines of work including mill designl ing and the manufacture of cotton goods and of cottonseed pro ducts He too previously has been employed by the federal governinent having recently carried on a special investigation in Europe for the Department of Commerce The post at Peking has been filled by transferring to it the consulgeneral at Hankow Trhis official has been in the consular service since 1902 for many years has done admirable work in trade promotion is widely acquaiinted with leading Chinese citizens and is thoroughly con versant with the Chinese language The position at Petrograd300 Avard Longley Bishop June also has been filled by the transfer to it of a member of the con sular service who has been located at Bombay Before enterinig the service in 1907 however he had received a valuable training in newspaper work having been connected with the Chicago Tribune the New York Evening Post and the Financial Times of London At Melbourne Australia the appointee is a man who has traveled extensively and who has had a wide business experience He has been engaged in the export trade since 1892 In the South American field four assignments have been made This was in conformity with the plans of Secretary Redfield and with the recommendations of the special committee of the Chanmber of Coinmerce of the United States of America referred to above At Rio de Janeiro our commercial attache is a man who has had a broad training in the general field of economics and in the special field of commerce at leading American and German universities He has been a successful teacher and administrator has traveled in alinost every part of the world and has made a valuable study on trade conditions in Brazil as special agent of the Department of Commerce He has written on commercial affairs and recently has publisihed a volume on The Panama Canal and International Trade Competition At Buenos Ayres the appointee is a man of wide experience in matters pertaining to the commercial development of South America and is the author of The Soutth Americas Sinice 1908 he has been an official of the PanAmerican Union and has traveled extensively in LatinAmerican countries with whose languages he is thoroughly conversant The position at Lima has been filled by the appointment of a man who since 1904 has been engaged successively in railroad transportation as an officer of the Philippine Constabulary and as foreign sales representative of the Standard Oil Company in the East Indies The fourth ap pointee to a South American post viz Santiago previously had been engaged as an engineer in railway construction and other projects in the United States and LatinAmerican countries and while so engaged was a careful student of commercial affairs Although the efforts of the commercial agent the commercial attache and the consul are directed more or less toward a common end there is of necessity no duplication of work As already 1 The names of the ten commiercial attaches corresponding to the above account of appointments to office are as follows A H Baldwin C W A Veditz E W Thompson J H Arnold H D Baker W C Downs Lincoln Hutchinson Albert Hale A I Harrington and V L Havens1915 Commercial Attaches and Foreign Trade 301 pointed out in anothler connection the duties of the consul are so varied and manifold that only a part of his time may be devoted to commercial affairs After all his true function lies not in the direction of rendering direct aid to his countrymen in gaining for eign markets but rather in the direction of giving assistance to the special representatives of American export houses who have been sent abroad to solicit orders Moreover he is capable of rendering further aid in an indirect and more or less intangible way by seeing to it that there exists a spirit of good feeling on the part of the citizens of his district toward the people of the United States The line of cleavage between the work of the consul and the commercial agent is apparent In a word the activity of the latter is expressly designed to supplement that of the consul and it is notably intensive The commercial agent is a specialist in a narrow field despatched temporarily to one district and then to another as necessity demands The commercial attache on the other hand seeks to supplement those investigations of the consul which of necessity are local by researches which are general and instead of being a representative of a special industry as is the commercial agent he would seek to assemble information to the end of serving alike every American business interest The true function of the commercial attache in our presentday business life has been presented by Secretary Redfield as reported in an article by the Chief of the Bureau of Foreign and Doniestic Commnerce in 7The Nations Business with remarkable clearness as follows What is essentially required of the comiimercial attache is initiative combined with practical imagination It is not sufficient for him to learn even with the most scrupulous care all that is now done in the commercial field in his district and report fully thereon This is but the beginning of his service It remains to build upon this foundatioln the affirmative structure of our commerce He should have vision to see what is not done to determine what is needed and point out the way to get it He should discern the articles not now made or sold in his territory for which a market would exist if these articles were properly made or well designed    He should advise how articles now sold are at fault and how we may improve upon them In brief he should advise how we can better do what is already done eitlher by ourselves or by others and how we can do that which is not now done at all either by ourselves or by our competitors    The attache should be alert to find out the weak spots in our competitors commer cial armor and to advise how our business meni may get a thrust therein He is to do creative and not imitative work    He should302 Avard Longley Bishop June deal witi all phases of commerce and industry methods and manners and terms quality and quantity and design colors and trademarks packing and postage and every significant detail which may affect our commerce In conclusion it mnay be stated that time alone will enable us to form a correct estimate of the actual benefit of commercial attaches to American foreign trading interests There is reason for believinig however that the service rendered will be of inestimable value In any event it is clear that the earnest endeavor of the Department of Commerce is to make of the commnercial attache service an imlportant tradepromoting agerncy The combined efforts of comI1 mercial attaches commercial agents diplomats and consuls slould in time afford the export trading interests of the country about all the assistance that it is the legitimate function of our government to render1 AVARD LONGLEY BISHOP Sheffield Scientific School of Yale University For

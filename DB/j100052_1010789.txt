J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1010789,CHILD LABOR IN THE GLASS INDUSTRY,I242573,CHILD LABOR IN THE GLASS INDUSTRY BY OWEN R LOVEJOY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE NATIONAL CHILD LABOR COMMITTEE THE GLASS INDUSTRY IS AT ONCE THE OLDEST AND THE YOUNGEST AMONG AMERICAN MANUFACTURING ENTERPRISES AS EARLY AS 1609 A GLASS HOUSE WAS ESTABLISHED IN JAMESTOWN VA WHICH MANUFACTURED THE FIRST GOODS EXPORTED FROM THIS COUNTRY THE ENTERPRISE WAS UNSUC CESSFUL HOWEVER AND UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF LAST CENTURY GLASSMAKING FAILED TO GAIN A HOPEFUL FOOTING AMONG US INDEED THE YEAR I865 FORTY YEARS AGOWHEN BOSTON WAS FIRST ABLE TO MANUFACTURE FLINT GLASS EQUAL TO THE BEST MADE IN ENGLAND MAY BE REGARDED AS THE BEGINNING OF SUCCESSFUL GLASS MANUFACTURE IN AMERICA ITS PRESENT HONORABLE POSITION AMONG DOMESTIC MANUFACTURES HAS BEEN ATTAINED MAINLY IN THE LAST TWENTYFIVE YEARS WHILE THE LAST DECADE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WITNESSED MORE RADICAL CHANGES IN THE INDUSTRY BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD THAN HAD OCCURRED IN THE PRECEDING THREE HUNDRED YEARS FROM THE INSTALLATION OF THE CONTINUOUS TANK IN PLACE OF THE POT SYSTEM OF HEATING THE GLASS FOR MANIPULATION INTRODUCED HERE FIRST AT JEANNETTE PA IN I888 INVENTION AND IMPROVEMENT HAVE CROWDED UPON EACH OTHER IN RAPID SUCCESSION UNTIL TODAY THE WINDOW GLASS BLOWING MACHINE IS A PROVEN SUCCESS THE PLATE GLASS INDUSTRY IS REVOLUTIONIZED BY LABOR AND FUELSAVING DEVICES THE MACHINE FOR BLOWING CHIMNEYS AND WIDEMOUTH BOTTLES IS DRIVING THE HAND BLOW ERS TO THE WALL BY CHEAPER AND BETTER PRODUCTION WHILE WITHIN THE PRESENT YEAR MACHINE BLOWERS FOR SMALLNECKED WARE HAVE DISPROVEN THE LAST CONTENTION OF THE OPPONENTS OF MECHANICAL PROGRESS AND BID FAIR IN THE NEAR FUTURE TO MONOPOLIZE THIS BRANCH OF THE ART IN THE DECADE I890I900 THE CAPITAL INVESTED IN THE INDUSTRY INCREASED 524 PER CENT TO A TOTAL OF OVER 6IOOOOOO THE INCREASE BEING DUE LARGELY TO THE TANK SYSTEM AND OTHER FORMS OF MORE EX PENSIVE MACHINERY AND TO THE GREATER EXPENSE IN PACKAGES FOR SHIP PING PURPOSES THE LARGEST SINGLE ITEM OF THE I663IOOO TOTAL EX 300CHILD LABOR IN THE GLASS INDUSTRY PENSE IN THE MANUFACTURE OF I900 WAS 4000000 FOR PACKAGES METAL CAPS AND RUBBER STOPPERS AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO 28 PER CENT OF THE TOTAL COST THE PRODUCTION IN I900 WAS 45 PER CENT GREATER THAN IN I89O ALTHOUGH THE AVERAGE WORKING SEASON FIRE IN I9OO WAS BUT SIX MONTHS AS AGAINST TEN MONTHS IN I890 AND FURTHERMORE OWING TO LABOR AND TRADE DIFFICULTIES THE POSSIBLE OUTPUT IN I900 WAS REDUCED BY THE IDLENESS OF 15 PER CENT OF THE FACTORIES REPRESENTING A CAPITAL OF 3500000OO A STUDY OF THE TRADE JOURNALS AND A FIELD INVESTIGA TION OF THE INDUSTRY LEAD TO THE BELIEF THAT THE GROWTH BOTH IN NUM BER AND SIZE OF PLANTS IS MORE RAPID SINCE IO90 THAN BEFORE NO MODERN INDUSTRY WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF SILKTHROWING AND COTTON MANUFACTURE MAKES A STRONGER DEMAND FOR CHILD LABOR THAN THE MANUFACTURE OF GLASS AT THE SIDE OF THE BLOWER AND GATH ERER IN THE BLISTERING HEAT OF THE FURNACE STANDS THE LITTLE CRACKER OFF BOY WHO BREAKS THE COOLING WAXLIKE GLASS FROM THE END OF THE BLOWPIPE AFTER THE CHIMNEY OR BOTTLE HAS BEEN LEFT IN THE MOLD SIT TING AT THE FEET OF THE BLOWER IS THE HOLDINGMOLD BOY WHO OPENS AND SHUTS THE MOLDS THEN THE STICKERUP OR WARMINGIN BOY TAKES THE WARE FROM THE MOLD AND HOLDS IT TO THE GLORYHOLE RE HEATING THE MOUTH THAT IT MAY BE SHAPED BY THE GAFFER OR FINISHER FROM THE FINISHER THE CARRYIN BOY TAKES THE WARE TO THE LEHR WHERE IT IS PROPERLY TEMPERED AND MADE READY FOR PACKING THE OTHER FORMS OF CHILD LABOR IN SOME FACTORIESETCHING POLISHING TYING PACKING ARE UNIMPORTANT AS COMPARED WITH THOSE MENTIONED THE EMPLOYMENT OF CHILDREN AT NIGHT IS POSSIBLY THE CROWNING OFFENSE 6F THE GLASS INDUSTRY AS VIEWED BY THOSE WHO OPPOSE INJURIOUS CHILD LABOR THE INTRODUCTION OF THE TANK SYSTEM MAKING PROFITABLE THE CONTINUOUS OPERATION OF THE PLANT MARKS A DECIDED STEP IN THE PROGRESS OF THE INDUSTRY BUT IT HAS LARGELY INCREASED THE DEMAND FOR BOYS AT NIGHT WORK UNTIL PROBABLY 60 PER CENT OF THE 7500 BOYS EM PLOYED IN GLASSHOUSES WORK AT NIGHT EVERY OTHER WEEK THE EVIL OF NIGHT LABOR IS INTENSIFIED BY THE ABNORMAL TEMPERATURE OF THE FACTORY AND THIS FROM BOTH THE PHYSICAL AND THE MORAL STANDPOINTS THE BOY IS IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH MEN WHO LABOR AT A KIND OF WORK REQUIRING QUICKNESS PRECISION NERVOUS STRAIN AND WHO IN THE EXCITE MENT OF THE MOMENT ARE OFTEN FORGETFUL OF THE MORALITIES OF CON DUCT SO ESSENTIAL TO THE FORMATION OF A BOYS CHARACTER ONE HESI TATES TO STATE WHAT MIGHT BE CONSTRUED AS A CRITICISM OF ANY GROUP 301 43THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF AMERICAS WORKING PEOPLE BY WHOSE ENERGY AND INTELLIGENCE THE FOUNDATIONS OF OUR NATIONAL PROSPERITY HAVE BEEN LAID YET IT IS A COMMON OBSERVATION THAT THE CHARACTER OF MEN IS OFTEN GREATLY AF FECTED BY THE NATURE OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT PROFANITY AND INTEMPER ANCE BEING PECULIARLY PREVALENT IN INDUSTRIES DEMANDING UNUSUAL RISKS TO LIFE OR LIMB OR REQUIRING LABOR IN AN ABNORMAL ATMOSPHERE IT IS BELIEVED THAT A BETTER SPIRIT IS DEVELOPING AMONG GLASSHOUSE OPERATIVES PARTLY DUE NO DOUBT TO THE EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT YET MUCH REMAINS TO BE DESIRED MANY GLASS FACTORIES ARE SORELY CRIPPLED FOLLOWING EVERY PAY DAY OR HOLI DAY OWING TO THE INTEMPERANCE OF SOME OF THE MEN AND THEIR INCA PACITY FOR CAREFUL WORK THE INTRODUCTION OF SUCH DEVICES AS REDUCE THE EXPOSURE OF THE MEN TO EXCESSIVE HEAT WILL DO MORE THAN ANY FORM OF TEMPERANCE AGITATION TO LESSEN THE ABNORMAL CRAVING FOR STIMULANT WHICH THEIR OVERTAXED BODIES NOW EXPRESS THE WORK IN A GLASSHOUSE IS USUALLY BY THE PIECE AND DURING THE RUSH HOURS OF A TURN WHEN ALL IS EXCITEMENT AND HURRY THE VISITOR WILL SHUDDER TO HEAR A BURLY MAN CURSE HIS LITTLE HELPER IN LANGUAGE BOUND TO LEAVE ITS DARK IMPRESS ON HIS PLASTIC MIND AND COLOR HIS IMAGINATION WITH STAINS THAT CANNOT BE EFFACED IT IS SIG NIFICANT THAT IN MANY GLASSHOUSES ONE HARDLY FINDS THE CHILD OF A GLASSBLOWER ONE WORKER WHO HAS SPENT HIS LIFE IN THE GLASSHOUSE WHEN ASKED THE REASON REPLIED I WOULD RATHER SEND MY BOYS STRAIGHT TO HELL THAN SEND THEM BY WAY OF THE GLASSHOUSE A YOUNG FRIEND WHOSE CHARACTER AND FAMILY ARE WELL KNOWN SAID RECENTLY THAT OF THE 175 BOYS WITH WHOM HE WORKED IN AN INDIANA FACTORY TWO YEARS AGO THERE WERE ONLY TEN AT THE END OF THE FIRE WHO WERE NOT CONFIRMED DRINKERS OF INTOXICANTS AND THE PROPRIETOR OF A SUCCESSFUL OHIO HOUSE SAID LAST SUMMER IN REPLY TO AN APPEAL FOR THE EDUCATION OF THE BOYS YOU CANT DO ANYTHING FOR THEM THE LITTLE DEVILS ARE VICIOUS FROM THEIR BIRTH A SOMEWHAT INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE GLASSHOUSE BOYS OF THIS AND OTHER COMMUNI TIES LEFT NO DOUBT AS TO THE VICIOUSNESS OF MANY THOUGH THE DATE OF ITS GENESIS WAS NOT ESTABLISHED ONE INCLINES HOWEVER TO THE OPIN ION OF A DISCERNING SCHOOL PRINCIPAL IN A THRIVING GLASS TOWN IN PENNSYLVANIA WHO SAYS MY OBSERVATION IS THAT WHEN A BOY LEAVES SCHOOL AND GOES INTO THE FACTORY AT TWELVE OR THIRTEEN BY THE TIME HE IS FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN HE IS TOO FOULMOUTHED TO ASSOCIATE WITH DECENT 302 44CHILD LABOR IN THE GLASS INDUSTRY PEOPLE THE INJURIOUS MORAL EFFECTS OF THE INDUSTRY ON LITTLE BOYS ARE FURTHER PROVEN BY THE STATEMENT OF ANOTHER LEADING OHIO GLASS MANUFACTURER WHO URGED THE ADVANTAGE OF SECURING BOYS FROM ELEVEN TO THIRTEEN YEARS OF AGE BY SAYING WHEN A BOY GETS TO BE SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD HE BECOMES LAZY AND HEADY AND WILL NOT WORK AS HE USED TO WHEN ASKED WHETHER THE FACTORY LIFE ITSELF HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS STATE OF MORAL FATIGUE HE REPLIED THAT THERE WAS NO WAY OF COMPARING BECAUSE A BOY RARELY EVER GOES INTO THE GLASSHOUSE AFTER HE REACHES SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN YEARS THE MENACE TO THE PHYSICAL WELLBEING OF THE CHILD IS NOT LESS IRREGULAR HOURS OF LABOR AND REST ARE UNDERMINING TO THE MATURE CONSTITUTION HOW MUCH MORE TO THE UNDEVELOPED RAPIDLY GROWING BOY AND WHEN THIS IRREGULAR EMPLOYMENT IS PURSUED IN AN EXCES SIVE HEAT WHICH FIRST STIMULATES AND THEN STUPEFIES SENDING THE BOY HOME AT 230 OR 430 IN THE MORNING THROUGH THE RAW DAMP NIGHT THE EVIL IS INTENSIFIED MANY MOTHERS CORROBORATE THE CRITICISM OF ONE EXPRESSED IN THESE WORDS WHEN CHARLEY WORKS ON THE NIGHT SHIFT HE HASNT ANY APPETITE ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANUFACTURERS WHO CONTEND THAT THE BOYS GET MORE REST AND ARE BETTER IN HEALTH WHEN ON THE NIGHT SHIFT THAN WHEN ON THE DAY THE NATIONAL CHILD LABOR COMMITTEE PROPOSES LEGISLATION WHICH SHALL FORBID THE EMPLOYMENT OF ANY BOY UNDER FOURTEEN YEARS OF AGE IN A GLASSHOUSE AND RESTRICT NIGHT EMPLOYMENT TO THOSE OVER SIXTEEN TWO OBJECTIONS ARE ADVANCED BY SOME REPRESENTATIVES OF THE INDUS TRY TO SUCH LEGISLATION THE FIRST OBJECTION IS THAT GLASS CANNOT BE MANUFACTURED WITHOUT THE AID OF SMALL BOYS IT IS CONTENDED THAT THE EFFICIENCY OF THE SHOP THE GROUP WORKING AT A SINGLE FUR NACE DEPENDS ON THE PRESENCE OF THE BOYS THAT THEY ARE USED FOR FORMS OF WORK WHICH MEN EITHER WILL NOT OR CANNOT DO BECAUSE THEY LABOR AT WAGES ADEQUATE FOR BOYS WORK BUT TOO SMALL TO INDUCE MEN TO WORK ONE MANUFACTURER A YEAR AGO CONTENDED THAT SEVERAL OF THE BEST HOUSES IN PENNSYLVANIA WOULD BE COMPELLED TO CLOSE IF THE AGE LIMIT FOR CHILDREN WERE RAISED FROM THIRTEEN TO FOURTEEN YEARS IT IS INTERESTING TO SEE THAT THIS DESPAIRING PROPHECY HAS NOT BEEN FULFILLED BUT THAT ON THE OTHER HAND THE INDUSTRY HAS SUB STANTIALLY INCREASED IN PENNSYLVANIA SINCE THE ENACTMENT OF THAT LAW AND SO FAR AS DISCOVERED NO INCONVENIENCE OF IMPORTANCE HAS ANY 303 45THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY WHERE BEEN SUFFERED A STUDY OF THE INDUSTRY IN RECENT YEARS WILL PROVE THE GROUNDLESSNESS OF SUCH FEARS AND WILL DEMONSTRATE THAT THE MANUFACTURE OF GLASS IS SO FIRMLY ESTABLISHED IN AMERICA THAT NO RESTRICTIVE LEGISLATION CONTEMPLATED BY ANY INTELLIGENT BODY OF CITIZENS FOR CHILD PROTECTION COULD MATERIALLY CHECK ITS GROWTH THAT GLASS MANUFACTURE DOES NOT DEPEND ON CHILD LABOR IS SHOWN BY THE FACT THAT DURING THE DECADE I89OI90O WHILE THE NUMBER OF FACTORIES INCREASED 20 PER CENT THE CAPITAL INVESTED 52 PER CENT THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES 17 PER CENT AND THE OUTPUT 45 PER CENT THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN EMPLOYED INCREASED BUT 25 PER CENT IN THE PRESSED AND BLOWN GLASS BRANCH OF THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH CHILDREN ARE EMPLOYEDPRACTICALLY NONE BEING ENGAGED IN THE BUILDING OR PRESSED GLASS INDUSTRYTHE INCREASE IS NO LESS STRIKING IN THE NUM BER OF FACTORIES THE INCREASE WAS 19 PER CENT IN CAPITAL INVESTED 54 PER CENT IN NUMBER OF WAGEEARNERS 24 PER CENT IN CHILDREN 56 PER CENT THE LOCATION OF THE GLASS INDUSTRY IS EVEN MORE INTERESTING THAN THESE GENERAL STATISTICS THE MANUFACTURE OF FRUITJARS BOTTLES OF ALL KINDS AND LAMP CHIMNEYS HAS MOVED STEADILY WESTWARD DURING THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS FROM PENNSYLVANIA MARYLAND WEST VIRGINIA AND NEW JERSEY WHERE CHILD LABOR LAWS WERE LAX AND RESTRICTION OF NIGHT LABOR ALMOST UNKNOWN INTO OHIO INDIANA AND ILLINOIS STATES IN WHICH LAWS HAVE BEEN ENACTED INCREASINGLY RESTRICTIVE AND IN TWO OF WHICH NIGHT WORK UNDER SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE IS PROHIBITED IN THE CENSUS OF I880 INDIANA DID NOT REPORT THE MANUFACTURE OF FRUIT JARS IN I890 IT MANUFACTURED 31 PER CENT OF THE TOTAL OUTPUT AND IN I9OO THE PERCENTAGE HAD INCREASED TO 70 IN I880 PENNSYLVANIA MANUFACTURED NEARLY TWOTHIRDS OF ALL OUR LAMP CHIMNEYS IN I89O OHIO STOOD FIRST MANUFACTURING TWICE AS MANY AS PENNSYLVANIA AND IN I9OO INDIANA HAD ATTAINED FIRST PLACE MANUFACTURING 45 PER CENT OF THE TOTAL FOLLOWED BY PENNSYLVANIA WITH 26 PER CENT AND OHIO WITH 21 PER CENT THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE MANUFACTURE HAS DECLINED IN THESE EASTERN STATES BUT ONLY THAT THE GROWTH IN OTHER STATES HAS FAR OUTSTRIPPED THEM ONE OF THE LARGEST AND POS SIBLY THE MOST SUCCESSFUL AMONG THE BOTTLE MANUFACTURING HOUSES IS NOW LOCATED IN OHIO AND A LEADING OFFICIAL OF THE PLANT EXPLAINED THE ENTIRE ABSENCE OF BOYS ON THE NIGHT SHIFT BY THE STATEMENT THAT THE REASON SHOPS FIND IT NECESSARY TO HIRE BOY LABOR FOR NIGHT WORK IS 304 46CHILD LABOR IN THE GLASS INDUSTRY BECAUSE THEY DO NOT WANT TO HIRE MEN WHEN ASKED WHETHER THE DEMAND FOR CHEAP LABOR WAS ESSENTIAL HE REPLIED THEY CAN ALL AFFORD TO EMPLOY MEN AND BOYS OVER SIXTEEN IT IS SIMPLY GREED AN OUTSIDER WOULD HESITATE TO MAKE SO SWEEPING A CHARGE BUT THE STATEMENT OF ONE IN THE BUSINESS MAY BE QUOTED WITHOUT OFFENSE THE DECADE I890I900 SHOWS BOTH INDIANA AND ILLINOIS LEADING PENNSYLVANIA IN THE MANUFACTURE OF GLASS BOTTLES THOUGH THE LAT TER STATE PERMITTED CHILD LABOR AT AGES AND HOURS FORBIDDEN IN BOTH THE OTHERS THE POSITION OF THE GLASS INDUSTRY IN THE WORLD MARKETS IS NO LESS ENCOURAGING TO THE CAUSE WE REPRESENT BETWEEN THE YEARS I89O I9OO FRENCH MIRROR GLASS IMPORTS DECREASED 95 PER CENT IMPORTED POLISHED PLATE OF ALL KINDS DECREASED 798 PER CENT FLUTED ROLLED AND ROUGH PLATE IMPORTS DECREASED 90 PER CENT BEING NEARLY EQUALLED IN THE LATTER YEAR BY THE EXPORTS OF A SINGLE AMERICAN SKYLIGHT FAC TORY WHILE THE IMPORTS OF ALL BOTTLES JARS CARBOYS ETC THE BRANCH OF THE TRADE ESPECIALLY EMPLOYING CHILDREN DECREASED 49 PER CENT IN THE SAME PERIOD THE EXPORTS OF ALL OTHER GLASS EXCEPT WINDOW GLASS INCREASED 1174 PER CENT THE LOCATION OF A GLASSHOUSE IS DETERMINED CHIEFLY BY CHEAPNESS OF FUEL THE LARGEST SINGLE ITEM OF EXPENSE IN MANUFACTURING THE UTILIZATION OF NATURAL GAS HAS CAUSED IT TO FOLLOW CLOSELY THE OPENING UP OF THE NATURAL GAS BELT IN THE PITTSBURGH DISTRICT ALONG THE OHIO RIVER THROUGH OHIO INDIANA AND ILLINOIS KANSAS WHICH REPORTS NO GLASSHOUSES IN THE CENSUS OF I9OO TODAY HAS NOT LESS THAN TWENTY IN SUCCESSFUL OPERATION THE INDUSTRY IN THE FUTURE WILL PROBABLY BE LESS NOMADIC THAN FORMERLY OWING TO THE GREATER EX PENSE OF CONSTRUCTION AND TO THE RECENTLY PROVEN SUCCESS AND ECON OMY OF GAS PRODUCED FROM CRUDE OILONE FIRM RECENTLY REPORTING THE OPERATION OF A PLANT BY THE USE OF CRUDE OIL GAS PRODUCED AT THE RATE OF 6000 CUBIC FEET OF GAS PER BARREL OF OIL AND AT A COST OF 7 CENTS PER THOUSAND FEET THE SECOND CONSIDERATION IN DETERMINING LOCATION IS MARKET FREIGHT RATES ON GLASS ARE UNUSUALLY HIGH AND OFTEN THE DISCRIMINA TION AGAINST THOSE SHIPPING BETWEEN CERTAIN POINTS IS ALMOST OPPRES SIVE THE ANNUAL CONSUMPTION OF GLASS FRUIT JARS IS NOT LESS THAN 700000 GROSS WHILE ONE LAMP CHIMNEY FACTORY MANUFACTURES THIRTY TONS OF GLASS A DAY AT ONE OF ITS PLANTS AND FORTY TONS AT ANOTHER 305 47THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY THE SUPERINTENDENT OF A LARGE TUMBLER HOUSE IN PENNSYLVANIA AFFIRMNS THAT THE FREIGHT RATE FROM HIS CITY TO ST LOUIS IS GREATER THAN THE RATE CHARGED FROM GERMANY TO ST LOUIS ON THE SAME CLASS OF WARE IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE INDUSTRY IS FAR MORE SENSITIVE TO THESE MARKET AND FREIGHT CONDITIONS THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER EXTENSIVE INDUSTRY IN THE COUNTRY AND THE RAPID INCREASE IN THE USE OF BOTTLES TABLEWARE LAMP CHIMNEYS AND FRUIT JARS THROUGHOUT THE WEST HAS COMBINED WITH THE OIL AND GAS FIELDS IN WINNING THE INDUSTRY TO THE WESTERN STATES THE PRINCIPAL INGREDIENTS IN THE MANUFACTURE OF GLASS HAVE GREATLY DECREASED IN COST WITHIN RECENT YEARS THE TOTAL COST OF SODA ASH HAVING FALLEN 27 PER CENT DURING THE DECADE I89OI9OO ALTHOUGH THE TOTAL CONSUMPTION INCREASED 63 PER CENT SAND IS FOUND IN SO MANY SECTIONS OF THE COUNTRY AS TO BE IN REACH OF ALL STATES MANU FACTURING GLASS WHILE SALTCAKE LIME AND LIMESTONE NITRATE OF SODA ARSENIC AND OTHER INGREDIENTS DO NOT ENTER INTO THE QUESTION OF LOCA TION THE THIRD INFLUENCE IS THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF LABOR AS THE SILK INDUSTRY IS RUSHING INTO THE MINING REGION WHERE GIRL LABOR IS TO BE HAD IN PLENTY AND AT SMALL COST SO THE GLASS INDUSTRY TENDS TO FOLLOW THOSE HEAVIER INDUSTRIES IN WHICH BOYS ARE NOT AVAILABLE AND TO BID FOR THE CHILD LIFE OF THOSE INDUSTRIAL COMMUNITIES IT IS NOT DENIED THAT LABOR LEGISLATION RESTRICTING THE EMPLOYMENT OF CHILDREN HAS A CERTAIN INFLUENCE AT THIS POINT IT IS ONLY CLAIMED THAT THE OTHER ITEMS OF COST ARE OF SO MUCH GREATER IMPORTANCE THAT A SUCCESSFUL GLASSHOUSE IS NOT MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY SUCH LEGISLA TION AS HAS BEEN PROPOSED BY THIS COMMITTEE INDEED IT IS GRATIFYING TO LEARN FROM SEVERAL OF THE MOST SUC CESSFUL MANUFACTURERS THAT THEIR DESIRE TO EMPLOY CHILDREN IN THE INDUSTRY IS MORE FROM CONSIDERATION FOR THE BOYS AND THEIR NEEDY FAMILIES THAN BECAUSE OF THE NEEDS OF THE INDUSTRY AND WE MAY HERE APPROPRIATELY INTRODUCE THE SECOND GENERAL OBJECTION TO CHILD LABOR LEGISLATION IT IS WELL EXPRESSED IN THE WORDS OF AN INFLUENTIAL EDITOR WHO SAID THE OBJECTION TO CHILD LABOR LEGISLATION IS MORE ON ACCOUNT OF THE LITTLE FELLOWS WHO WOULD BE DEPRIVED OF THE WORK THAN ON ACCOUNT OF THE INDUSTRY THE REFUGE OF THOSE COMPELLED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE INDUSTRY CAN GROW AND THRIVE WITHOUT THE LABOR OF LITTLE CHILDREN BUT WHO STILL DEFEND THE CUSTOM IS IN THE 306 48CHILD LABOR IN THE GLASS INDUSTRY PLEA EITHER THAT THE CHILDREN ARE BETTER OFF IN THE FACTORY THAN ON THE STREET THAT THEY BELONG TO THE CLASS HAD IN MIND BY A PROMINENT CITIZEN WHO RECENTLY SAID IF YOU EDUCATE ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WILL DO THE DIRTY WORK THE HARD MANUAL LABOR OR THAT THE POOR WIDOW WITH THE LARGE FAMILY WILL BE THROWN UPON PUBLIC CHARITY IF THE BOY IS TAKEN FROM THE FACTORY TO THE FIRST FORM OF THE OBJECTION IT IS ONLY NECESSARY TO ANSWER THAT THE TRUTH OF THE STATEMENT DEPENDS UPON THE NATURE OF THE FACTORY AND THE CONDITION OF THE STREET AND THAT THE SPIRIT OF AMERICA HAS IN MIND EDUCATIONAL PROVISION FOR ALL CHILDREN WHO SHOULD BE PRO TECTED FROM BOTH FACTORY AND STREET IF ANY CHILD IS REDUCED TO EITHER OF THESE ALTERNATIVES THEN A RADICAL DEFECT IS TO BE UNEARTHED IN THE LIFE OF THAT COMMUNITY AND CORRECTION OF THE MALCONDITION SHOULD BEGIN WITHOUT DELAY TO THE SECOND FORM OF THE OBJECTION THE ONLY ANSWER IN HARMONY WITH THE ETHICS OF DEMOCRACY IS THAT THE DIVISION OF SOCIETY INTO TWO CLASSES ONE OF WHICH SHALL BE EDUCATED AND ENJOY LIFE AND THE OTHER BE KEPT IN IGNORANCE AND CONFINED TO DIRTY WORK AND DENIED EDUCATION FOR FEAR OF AROUSING DISCONTENT HAS BEEN THE CURSE OF FORMER CIVILIZATIONSCURSING BOTH THE SERVANTS AND THE SERVED AND HAS NO PLACE IN A SOCIETY THAT LIVES BY THE PARTICIPATION OF ITS CITI ZENS IN ITS CIVIC AND POLITICAL AFFAIRS THE THIRD FORM OF THE OBJECTION MUST BE CONSIDERED MORE SERI OUSLY NO DOUBT MANY FAMILIES ARE IN CERTAIN PERIODS KEPT FROM DIRE WANT THROUGH THE MEAGRE EARNINGS OF LITTLE CHILDREN NO DOUBT ALSO THAT IF SOCIETY IS TO COMPEL THE EDUCATION OF THE CHILDREN AND THEIR EXCLUSION FROM INJURIOUS LABORBOTH IN THE INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC WELFARESOCIETY MUST ALSO TAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS TO EXECUTE THESE LAWS WITHOUT IMPOSING UNDUE HARDSHIP ON THOSE PERSONS IN GREATEST NEED OF SYMPATHY AND SOCIAL EQUITY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE IN THIS PLACE TO ENTER UPON A DEFENSE OF THE POSITION THAT EVERY WIDOW WHO SEEKS TO REAR AND EDUCATE A FAMILY OF CHILDREN SHOULD BE REGARDED AS SO CLEARLY A CONTRIBUTOR TO THE PUBLIC WEALTH THAT HER HONORABLE MAINTENANCE SHALL BE GUARANTEED AS A MATTER OF JUSTICE NOT OF CHARITY WE MUST HERE CONFINE OURSELVES TO THE DISCUSSION OF THE PLACE OF THE CHILD IN THE PROBLEM AND THE NECESSITY OF HIS ELIMINATION AS A FACTOR IN DOMESTIC SUPPORT IT IS GRANTED THAT THE WAGES OF A SMALL BOY IN A GLASSHOUSE 307 49THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY WILL BRING A PITTANCE INTO THE FAMILY TREASURY IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT THE GENERAL CONDITION OF POVERTY IN THE COMMUNITY IS THEREFORE AT ALL RELIEVED A STOGIE ROLLER MAY EARN 5 OR 6 A WEEK OR AN EXPERT WHO CAN ROLL 2500 A DAY MAY EARN 12 A WEEK IN A TENEMENT WHERE VICE AND FEVER PROPAGATE TOGETHER IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT STOGIE ROLLING IS A BLESSING TO THE POOR ON THE OTHER HAND THE AVERAGE STOGIE ROLLER GROWS POORER EVERY YEAR AND THE INFLUX OF POVERTY DRAWN BY THIS AND OTHER FORMS OF INDUSTRY WHICH BRING QUICK RE TURNS WITHOUT INVESTMENT OF CAPITAL OR SKILL FILLS THE REGIONS PROMOT ING THEM WITH AN EVERINCREASING NUMBER OF HUNGRY MOUTHS TO THE BEWILDERMENT ALMOST THE DESPAIR OF PHILANTHROPIC AGENCIES GREAT INDUSTRIES BRING IN THEIR TRAIN THE SMALL MERCHANT AND THE PEDDLER THE CHEAP GARMENT WORKER AND THE STOGIE ROLLER WHO LIVE OFTEN IN ABJECT POVERTY AND WORK IN CRAMPED TENEMENTS OF UNVENTILATED FILTH BUT IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT ONLY THOSE INDUSTRIES THAT CAN PROFITABLY EMPLOY THE IGNORANT THE WEAK THE CHILDREN OF THE POOR ARE TO ANY DEGREE CONCERNED IN THE PROTECTION OF THE POOR WIDOW AND HER OFFSPRING THE BUILDING TRADES HAVE COST THE LIVES OF MANY TOILERS AND LEFT MANY POOR WIDOWS AND DEFENSELESS CHILDREN BUT ONE DOES NOT HEAR THE BOSS CARPENTER OR THE EMPLOYER OF STRUCTURAL IRON WORKERS DEFENDING THE EMPLOYMENT OF CHILDREN ON THE BASIS OF PHILANTHROPY NEITHER THE STEEL MILLS THE LUMBER CAMPS THE MANUFACTORIES OF LOCOMOTIVES OR THE GREAT RAILROADS SEEM SENSI TIVEAS INDUSTRIESTO THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN IN NEED OF WORK ONLY WHERE THE LITTLE CHILD CAN BE WORKED AT A PROFIT ARE MEN FOUND SOLICITOUS FOR THE WELFARE OF THE CHILDREN WHO WILL BE IDLE UNLESS EMPLOYED BY THEM WE HAVE TOO LONG PERMITTED THE EMPLOYER OF CHILDREN TO FEEL THAT HE HOLDS A SPECIAL GUARDIANSHIP OVER THE WIDOWS OF THE COM MONWEALTH WE DO NOT QUESTION HIS MOTIVES FOR HE SEES THE PROBLEM IN THE CONCRETE RATHER THAN IN ITS BROAD IMPLICATIONS AND THE CUSTOMS OF HIS INDUSTRY HAVE INEVITABLY FORCED HIM TO FACE CONDITIONS IN THE COMMUNITY WHICH HAVE BROUGHT HIM TO HIS VIEWPOINT BUT IT IS THE DUTY OF THE PUBLIC TO LEARN AND THEN TO TEACH THAT THE COTTON MANUFACTURER THE SILK MANUFACTURER THE CIGAR MANUFACTURER THE PROPRIETOR OF A NEWSPAPER OR TELEGRAPH OFFICE THE MANUFACTURER OF GLASS OR THE PRESIDENT OF A COAL MINING COMPANY IS NO MORE RESPON SIBLE TO RELIEVE THE POVERTY OF THE COMMUNITY THROUGH THE EMPLOY 308 SOCHILD LABOR IN THE GLASS INDUSTRY MENT OF ITS LITTLE CHILDREN THAN IS THE RAILROAD MANAGER THE BUILDING CONTRACTOR THE STEEL MANUFACTURER THE EMPLOYER OF LONGSHOREMEN THE LUMBER DEALER OR THE MANUFACTURER OF LOCOMOTIVES LET EACH INDUSTRY STAND ON ITS ECONOMIC BASIS AND LET US REMEMBER THAT POV ERTY IS NEVER ELIMINATED BY BEING CONGESTED AND THAT POOR WIDOW HOOD IS NOT PERMANENTLY RELIEVED BY SUCH INDUSTRIES AS BID FOR CHEAP LABOR AND THUS BECKON THE INEFFICIENT AND NEEDY TO HOVER ABOUT THEM WE CONTEND THEN THAT THE GLASS INDUSTRY IS NOT COMPELLED TO EMPLOY LITTLE CHILDREN EITHER FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE CHILDREN NOR FROM NECESSITIES OF THE INDUSTRY THE EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL GLASS BUDGET IN THE ISSUE OF NOVEMBER 25 I905 ECHOES THE SENTIMENT OF MANY PROMINENT MANUFACTURERS IN ASSERTING THAT THE INTRODUCTION OF MOD ERN MACHINERY AND AUTOMATIC DEVICES HAS CHANGED MODERN FACTORY REQUIREMENTS TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT IT CAN TRUTHFULLY BE SAID THAT AS A RULE THE GLASS FACTORY OF TODAY WHICH STILL REQUIRES THE WORK OF THE SMALL BOY IS OPERATED IN THE CRUDEST MOST PRIMITIVE MOST EX PENSIVE AND ANTIQUATED MANNER THE AUDITOR OF ONE OF THE LARGEST GLASS MANUFACTURING CONCERNS IN AMERICA A COMPANY WHICH DOES NOT EMPLOY ANY CHILD LABOR SAID RECENTLY FLINT GLASS MANUFACTURE HAS FOLLOWED AT THE TAIL END OF THE PROCESSION WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE EASE WITH WHICH STEEL AND IRON ARE HANDLED IN THE GREAT FACTORIES AND THEN WATCH THE LITTLE BOYS CARRYING HOT GLASS IN THE BOTTLE HOUSES IT LOOKS EXTREMELY CRUDE THERE IS A WHOLE LOT OF THIS WORK WHICH COULD BE AS WELL DONE BY MACHINERY ONE OF THE OWNERS OF AN EXTENSIVE LAMP CHIMNEY FACTORY OPERATED NOW ALMOST ENTIRELY BY BLOWING MACHINERY ESTIMATES THAT THEY EMPLOY ABOUT ONEHALF THE NUMBER OF BOYS FORMERLY EMPLOYED FOR THE SAME AMOUNT OF WORK THAT WHEREAS THEY FORMERLY EMPLOYED BOYS OF TWELVE OR FOUR TEEN YEARS WHO EARNED 6 A WEEK THEY CAN NOW EMPLOY YOUNG MEN OVER SIXTEEN YEARS OLD WHOSE EARNINGS ARE FROM 14 TO 20 A WEEK WHEN ASKED IF THE NET COST WAS NOT GREATER NOW THAN FORMERLY HIS ANSWER WAS WE CAN NOW AFFORD TO PAY MENS WAGES FOR BOYS WORK IT IS NOT OF COURSE SUGGESTED THAT CHILD LABOR IS NO LONGER PROFITABLE IN THE MAKING OF GLASS MANY FACTORIES WOULD BE TEM PORARILY INCONVENIENCED BY BEING COMPELLED TO EMPLOY OLDER BOYS FOR THE WORK NOW DONE AT TRIFLING COST BY YOUNG CHILDREN IT IS ONLY CON 309 5STHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY TENDED THAT THE INDUSTRY AS SUCH WILL NOT BE INJURIOUSLY AFFECTED BY SUCH RESTRICTIVE LEGISLATION BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WILL BE STIMULATED TO GREATER ECONOMIES AND IMPROVEMENTS THAN WILL BE UTILIZED WHILE HUMAN LIFE CAN BE PURCHASED AT SO SLIGHT A COST BUT EVEN WERE THE INDUSTRY ITSELF IMPERILLED SOCIETY CANNOT BE INTERESTED IN THE MAIN TENANCE OF INDUSTRIES WHICH MUST EXIST AT THE SACRIFICE OF CHILD LIFE ONE ENTERPRISING EMPLOYER WHEN OBJECTING TO THE ENFORCEMENT OF CHILD LABOR LAWS COMPLAINED THAT SUCH LEGISLATION WOULD ULTIMATELY FORCE THEM TO INSTALL MACHINERY THAT WOULD DO AWAY WITH THE NECES SITY FOR SMALL BOYS THAT ANY INCONVENIENCE TO THE INDUSTRY FROM SUCH LEGISLATION AS WE URGE MIGHT BE AVOIDED BY A MORE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF WAGES HAS FREQUENTLY BEEN POINTED OUT TO BOTH EMPLOYERS AND EM PLOYEES IN THE COURSE OF THIS INVESTIGATION FEW SKILED TRADES PAY BETTER WAGES THAN GLASS BLOWING AND WHILE THE HAND WORK IS TODAY MADE PRECARIOUS BY THE RAPID INTRODUCTION OF MACHINERY AND MANY GLASS BLOWERS SEE THEIR TRADE VANISHING IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT THE WORK ERS ON THE NEW MACHINES ARE PAID WAGES THAT ARE LARGE AS COMPARED WITH WAGES IN OTHER FORMS OF MANUAL LABOR WHEN ONE SUGGESTS THAT GLASS BLOWERS AND FINISHERS MIGHT BE WILLING TO HAVE THEIR WAGES SLIGHTLY REDUCED WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE DIFFERENCE SHALL BE MADE UP TO OLDER HELPERS TAKING THE PLACES OF THE SMALL BOYS THE SUGGESTION IS ALWAYS LAUGHED OUT OF COURTWHETHER MADE TO PROPRIETOR OR WORKMEN TO WATCH MEN WORKING FOR 4 TO IO A DAY AIDED BY LITTLE BOYS WHO EART FROM 65 CENTS TO IIO A DAY FOR BOYS WORK ALTHOUGH WORKING THE SAME NUMBER OF HOURS AND SUBJECTED TO THE SAME INTENSE HEAT WHETHER IN UNION OR NONUNION SHOPS FORCES THE DOUBT WHETHER LABOR IS ALWAYS ENTIRELY SERIOUS IN ITS PROTEST AGAINST THE EMPLOYMENT OF LITTLE CHILDREN IT IS NOT TO BE UNDERSTOOD THAT SUCH A POLICY OF WAGE REDUCTION FOR SKILLED LABOR IS HERE ADVOCATED IT IS PROBABLE THAT UNDER PRESENT INDUSTRIAL CONDI TIONS IN WHICH LABOR STANDS ALWAYS OFFERING ITSELF FOR SALE IN THE OPEN MARKET WAGES ARE RARELY IF EVER HIGHER THAN THE SERVICE WAR RANTS IT IS ONLY SUGGESTED THAT WITH CHILD LABOR IN THE GLASS INDUS TRY STANDING A CONFESSED MENACE TO SOCIETYA FACT WELL KNOWN BY EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE ALIKEAND WITH A DISPARITY IN WAGES BETWEEN THE SKILLED MAN AND THE BOY WHICH APPEARS UNJUSTIFIED BY THE AMOUNT OF SERVICE RENDERED SOME AMICABLE ADJUSTMENT SHOULD BE REACHED 31O 52CHILD LABOR IN THE GLASS INDUSTRY BETWEEN THE RIVAL FORCES THAT WOULD PUT AN END TO THE SACRIFICE OF THE CHILD IN THE INTEREST OF EITHER PARTY THE RESPONSIBILITY WILL BE REVEALED BY PROPER LEGISLATION IF ONLY THE GREED OF THE MANU FACTURER DETERS HIM FROM PAYING WAGES ADEQUATE TO REWARD MEN AND LARGER BOYS SELFINTEREST WILL FORCE HIM TO THIS WHEN LITTLE CHIL DREN CAN NO LONGER BE EMPLOYED BUT IF THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID IN WAGES IS ALL THAT THE INDUSTRY WARRANTS AND THE WAGES OF SKILLED WORKERS ARE OUT OF ALL PROPORTION TO THOSE PAID THE CHILDREN THEN THE GENUINENESS OF LABORS PROTEST WILL BE PUT TO THE TEST WE DO NOT HERE PROFESS TO KNOW WHETHER THE SACRIFICE SHOULD BE MADE BY THE EMPLOYER OR THE EMPLOYEE REGARDLESS OF THE EFFECT ON PRICES OR WAGES OR THE FORTUNES OF PARTICULAR PLANTS OR THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE HANDWORKING AND THE MACHINE OPERATING FACTORIES OR THE STRIFE WHICH EXISTS TODAY BETWEEN THE UNION AND THE OPEN SHOPS THE PUBLIC IS INTERESTED ONLY TO SEE THAT GLASSTHAT MOST WONDERFUL AND BEAUTIFUL OF OUR MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS THE SYMBOL AND CON VEYER OF LIGHT THE HIGHEST INSTRUMENT IN THE HANDS OF SANITARY SCIENCE AND THE HEALING ARTSHALL BE MADE WITHOUT BEARING BENEATH ITS POLISHED SURFACE THE LIVES OF LITTLE CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEEN BURNED INTO ITS GLITTERING SUBSTANCE 3 I 53

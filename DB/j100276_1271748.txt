j100276,Michigan Law Review,1271748,Jury Competence of Juryman Discretion of the Court,i254431,RECENT IMPORTANT DECISIONS 703 in the property from the defendant Held that the partition decree did not affect the plaintiffs rights because she became an heir to the property imme diately upon the death of her father and not having been a party to the suit was not bound by it Deal v Sexton 1907  N C  56 S E Rep 69g In this situation there would seem to be a conflict between the principle that a judgment is res judicata only against parties to a suit and the policy of the law to uphold judicial sales There being no way of ascertaining the existence of such unborn children it seems hard to hold purchasers in good faith accountable for their shares However following the strict rules of law which declare that an unborn infant takes as heir to the land of its father equally with other children and that a person not a party to a suit is not bound by the judgment we are bound to reach the conclusion of the principal case The authorities are almost uniformly with the principal case Pearson v Carlton I8 S C 47 Giles v Solomon N Y Io Abb Prac N S 97 note Detrick v Migatt I9 Ill 146 McConnell v Smith 39 Ill 279 Botsford v OConner 57 Ill 72 Massie v Hiatts Admr 82 Ky 314 On the other hand JUDGE FREEMAN strongly dissented from the doctrine in a note to Carter v White IOI Am St Rep 869870 and in support of his contention cites Knotts v Stearns 91 U S 638 23 L Ed 252 However it would seem that the only way to avoid this seemingly harsh situation is by statute which will postpone the partition suit until after possibility of post humous children has passed JURYAFFINITY AS AFFECTING COMPETENCE OF JURYMANOn examina tion of the jurors as to their competency to serve it was found that one of the jurors was related by affinity to the accused held death had removed the relationship and the juror was qualified to serve Gillespie v State 1907  Ind  80 N E Rep 829 The rule seems to be that affinity is a cause far challenge while the party through whom the relationship is gained is living If this party is deceased but leaves heirs surviving the disqualification also survives But if the party through whom the affinity is claimed is dead and no heirs survive then the juror is not disqualified Bigelow v Sprague I40 Mass 425 Cain v Ingham 7 Cow N Y 478 State v Shaw 25 N C 532 Clearly the weight of authority is with the decision of the principal case but the rule is not universal In Bank v Hart 3 Day Conn 491 a juror had married the sister of a party in another case depending upon the same principles Although the wife was then dead the juror was excused from sitting on the trial In Bigelow v Sprague supra the relationship by affinity was much more involved than in principal case and the juror was held competent to act as such In this case an uncle of plaintiff married an aunt of the juror and two uncles of the juror married aunts of the plaintiff but each marriage had been dissolved by death of one of the parties and there was no issue of the marriages JURYCOMPETENCE OF JURYMANDISCRETION OF THE COURTOn cross examination a juror stated that he knew deceased that he read an account of the homicide at the time it occurred in both daily papers of GalvestonMICHIGAN LAW REVIEW 704 talked with several people about it and from what he had read and heard he formed a conclusion at the time as to the guilt of the defendant and such conclusion was still in his mind and it would take evidence to remove it Upon challenge for cause he answered that he could go into the jury box and try this case from the evidence and that alone regardless of anything he had heard Held no error in overruling the challenge Another juror in the same case was said to have made statements to two others whose affi davits were attached to the motion to excuse said juror that defendant was guilty and that if he were selected a juror on the case he would vote guilty The juror in question counteraffidavited in toto Held no error in over ruling the motion to excuse the juror Gregg v State I9o7  Tex  Ioo S W Rep II6I The rule in Texas is that the juror must have formed such conclusion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused as would influence his action in finding a verdict It would seem in all reason that where a juror says on examination that he has formed a conclusion which it will take evidence to remove he has formed a conclusion which will influence his action in forming a verdict This question of opinion of jurors as affecting their competency to serve as a juror is discussed at length in MICHIGAN LAW RtviEW Vol V No 4 at page 9go and the authorities are therein cited It will be seen that there is a very respectable line of cases holding that a juror who has formed an opinion which it will take evidence to remove is incompetent But the competency of a juror is a question for the court and in the absence of any abuse of discretion is not reviewable Maclin v State 44 Ark I15 Williams v State 69 Ga II Territory v Evans 2 Idaho 627 State v Lewis 49 La Ann 919 Patterson v State 48 N J L I9 Vroom 381 State v Harris 36 S C 504 JUSTICES OF THE PEACEJURISDICTIONAMOUNT IN CONTROVERSYNotice claiming 9999 with interest for eight days and costs held to be in excess of the jurisdiction of the justice of the peace under the Const Art 2  I Evans v Murphy I907  Ia  Io N W Rep Io25 In the absence of a written agreement conferring it a justice of the peace is without jurisdiction when the amount in controversy exceeds Ioo Sec I Art 2 of the Const of Iowa 4477 Code The amount in controversy here not including the interest and costs is one cent less than Ioo the juris dictional limit But adding the costs and interest the amount is over Ioo The Iowa courts construe the limit to be Ioo including the costs and interest The states seem to be almost equally divided on this question Of twenty seven states examined as to their holding thirteen support the principal case and fourteen hold contrary In a few states the question has been held both ways The cases supporting the principal case are Milburn v Burton Fed Cas

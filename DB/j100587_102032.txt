to the Air SInce the Excellent Mr Boyle has made the Air a Sub ject of his Observations the Learned World is suffi cently taught how vast a share it has in producing many effects which Philosophy never so much as dreamt of be fore and if upon the hint experiment has given us we reflect on the infinite variety of steams constantly emitted from all sorts of Bodyes into the Atmosphere which are there dissolvd as it were in a common Men struum we have reason to expect therein particles e nough of all shapes sizes and motions fit and proper to al ter the texture diminish or increase the Bulk and weight of almost any body exposd to its action As to the Increase of Weight the business in hand we know how bodies Robd of some constituent parts by fire as quicklime and all calxes slacken and greedily imbibe something from the Air and the like is observd in the caput mortuum of Salt Nitre Alum and Vitriol On the same score all fixt Salts run into a fluid per diliquium Tis the Air that in seven years fully reimpregnates the earth heapt up in the shade whence Nitre was before ex tracted tis the Air that causes the Efflorescence of Marca sites and Vitriolstones tis the Air that by its acid turns the lead of old buildings intoCerusse which without doubt increases in Weight as that made by fire does which is asserted to be at the rate of six or seven pound in an hundred The same Growth of Metals seem to acknow ledge the same origine and there are none Gold it self not excepted but what Agricola Gerhardus and some o ther Metallick Writers observe to have increasd conside rably by the free accesse of Air tothe Shafts and Groves and the very heaps of Rubbish washt from Tin Oars here in England have within the memory of man nay in 10 or 12 years been wrought over again with great advantage now497 now though we must perhaps acknowledge in some of these Instances that the particular Seminal principle spe cifies these new acquird parts and determinately makes them Mineral or Metallick of the name and nature of the Matrix into which they are received yet this is certain the addition of weight is owing to a Substance communicated by the Air Instances of this nature con cerning the growth of Lead Iron Tin Silver and Gold with the Increase of other bodies are succincty collected and with his wonted Sagacity remarkt on by Mr Boyle in his tracts on that subject So that the Increase and attractive power of Solids is a Theme already fairly cutivated and put beyond question But that liquids such as seem Satu rated with their own moysture should nevertheefs imbibe more from the Air is not mentioned by any Author I know of except the aforesaid Learned person who in his Tract of Aerial magnets advices tryals upon the liquid pre parations of Vitriol I have heard indeed some Druggists have accidentally taken notice of this encrease in Oyl of Vitriol and perhaps have improvd it to their own gain though to the detriment of the buyer but the observa tion never was prosecuted with any method or certain ac count how much the said Increase was and what the sub stance gaind The Industrious Chymist Mr White our University O perator having a Viol of that liquor unstopt and constant ly running over first gave occasion to the following notes but since from thence no true estimate of the just Increase could be collected I hope it may not prove altogether un grateful to the Curious to give you in answer to your request what has occurd more particularly on this sub ject and I do it the more readily because the R S have thought it a thing not to little for the press On the ninth of No 1683 Three Drams of Oyl of Vitriol so far Dephlegmd as to burn or Corrode a strong pack 12 thred498 thred assunder was exposd to the Air in a Marmalade Glass of three

taining all the considerable variety to be observd in this business it would be superfluous and impertinent to trouble the Reader with any longer Diary which was kept to the 4th of January 168 when the Increase in 24 hours amounted scarce to half a grain and probably had the weather been then dry it might have been none at all or rather the liquor might have lost what before it had gaind as I shall observe by and by to some other purpose But what is obvious to discourse upon the whole relates either to the Manner Causes Substance Quantity and Time of the Increase or to the Use that may be made of the experiment in order to the discovering of the changes in the Air As to the first the more our liquor was Saturated the  was its dayly increase though not gradually less by an even descent each day but sometimes 2 or more na tural days together it was exactly the same a day or two after less and then again more the next day following ac cording as the liquor stood affected by the heat or cold dryness or moisture of the weather the differing time of the day and quarter of the Wind Thus upon the view of the whole Diary of almost two months it appeard the increase was more in a Moist Rainy Misty and Snowy but less in a Frosty Clear and Dry Season as also was more in a Cold than in a Warm Air When the Wind was Northerly or Easterly the gain was less caeteris paribus than when Southerly or Wester ly and was less in the day than in the night The primary cause of this Phaenomenon seems to be the Moisture of the Air which our liquor a potential fire im501 imbibes as greedily as actual fire does the pabulum of Ni tre yet we must allow that all the other Circumstances of Season just now mentiond have each their parti cular influences in diversifying the quantity of the In crease Thus it appears in the Table that heat alters the pro gress of increasing For on the fourteenth day of November from 11 mat to 11 pom at which time specially towards night a very unusual and troublesome heat in the Air was complaind of by several here in Ox ford in twelve hours the gain was only three Grains and  whereas in the like time preceeding twas 10 Grains and  and in that just following 9 Grains Neither indeed can any thing otherwise be expected from Heat since thereby the Moisture might rather be exhald or at least might be suspended agitated and in timately mixt with the substance of the Air and conse quently not so easily be Arrested and Entangled by the surface of the Liquor as when the Air is less hot How ever allowing the effect of this anomalous accident at a time of the year when least expected and considering that most commonly Heat keeps even pace with the Sea son of the year depending as to its temper for the most part on the Nearness or Remoteness of the Sun we may safely conclude Moisture the cheif and only cause of the Increase of Weight in Oyl of Vitriol since in Dry Clear weather it constantly increases less then in Moist and Cloudy the circumstance of Heat or Cold remaining the same in both But this will be clearly evinced by an enquiry made into the nature of the substance gaind with the Increase of Weight For by the ordinary wayes of tryal it appeard the Atmosphere afforded our liquor nothing besides some of its matry particles wherewith it always abounds but more especially is ready to part with in Moist weather The Air without doubt has great variety of different Substances floating in it whereof some particles do ad here502 here to this some other sort to that body according as ei ther is peculiarly disposd to receive one sort rather than another Thus the Mortar in the Joints of old Walls and Vaults from Corpuscles attracted from the Air Sprouts out and frames a peculiar kind of Salt I have known a Deal Shelfe moistend only with the Liquor of sixt nitre frosted over with Christals of a perfect inflama ble nitre by regaining the proper acid from the Air all one as if so much Spirit of nitre had been pourd on the said Liquor I have seen a Viol half filld with Oyl of Tar tar per deliquium by being lest open to the Air beset a bove the Liquor with peculiarly figurd Crystalls and at the bottom were flat Christalizd plates of Salt which without flame crackled on a live Coal and left behind a Calx much like Dr Lysters nitrum Calcarium And tis well known Colcothar of Vitriol reimpregnated by the Air will by a fresh distillation give you its proper Acid as at first Now upon such hints as these some fond of the doctrine of Alcali and Acid might perhaps expect since diffe ring Bodies of an Alcalizate nature do thus regain their proper acids that vice versa even this most acid Liquor Oyl of vitriol also might find its Alcalizate associate in the Air from which the violence of fire had before driven it but we could discover no such matter the tast of our augmented Liquor was still purely acid and only weaker than before whereas it would have been Saltish had an Alcali been combind with it and its colour from a deep reddish became limpid all one as if the like quantity of fair water had been mixt but to be more certain in this point I distilld off the new gaind Substance at first it came over as insipid as clear water and urging the fire farther the drops provd sowr the remaining Oyl in the Retort was altogether as Corrosive as at first whence we may infer its Edge was not at all blunted by any adjoynd Alcali so that what the Air afforded was nothing else but meer water only As503 As to the quantity of the whole Encrease it cant be determind by any general rule since it varies accor ding to the different Strength of the Oyl of Vitriol for it appears by the Table the more diluted the Liquor the less attractive it provd This here imployd as highly Phlegmd I presume as any usually is gave a triple and more than  of its first weight amounting in all from three to nine Drams and thirty Grains before it come to a Stand Which proportion of Encrease I found con firmed in lesser quantities also as three Grains En creast to more then nine Grains and one Grain gave the weight of something more than three Grains But besides the strength of the Liquor there are other Cir cumstances as the Season of the year and position of the place which will certainly something alter this point thus our liquor will gain more in Winter than in Sum mer more in a Cellar and Sunless Room than in a Room not so qualifid All these circumstances which relate to the quantity will also influence very much the time of the Encrease the last thing to be considerd in the experiment but I shall only mention that which makes the most pecu liar and principal variation in this point and tis the proportion of the Surface to the bulk of the Liquor For I find the greater or less the Surface is the quicker or slower the Encrease Thus three Grains dropt and diffusd to nere  Inch breadth on a peice of Glass gaind three Grains in six hours one Grain in six more one Grain and  in twelve hours more in the next 12 hours gained  a Grain and in the last twelve hours it gaind very little observable So that in less then forty eight hours having more then triple its first weight it was for some time fully satiated till Rainy weather added some thing more But to discover more nicely what intrest the propor K tion504 tion of Surface has in hastening or retarding the increase of weight I exposd in the same Room and to the same temper of the Air as near as I could Guess three Drams of the same Oyl of Vitriol in an open flat Glass one Inch Broad being only  of the Diameter of that Glass usd at first with the like quantity The result was this that whereas the other Surface of three Inches Diameter gaind as in the Table near nineteen Grains the first six hours this less Surface gained a very little perceivable more then two grains in the same space of time Now since the Areas ofCircles are to one another as the squares of their respective diametersas one the square of the less is to nine the square of the greater Glasses dia meter So was the weight of a little more than two Grains gaind in the narrower Glasse to near 19 Grains gaind in the broader wherefore the time of Increasing bears as near as can be expected an exact proportion to the Surface of the Liquor exposd and the liquor in the lesser Glass having but  part of the Surface of the greater could not be satiated under nine times as many days as the greater From what has been said it will also follow that if this three Drams had a Surface in the same proportion to the weight of a Sruple and a Grain viz a little more than six  Inches Diam as that of  Inch was to three Grains the Encrease of both would be finisht in the same time and would ex cuse the long attendance of any that shall think it worth while to repeat the experiment Perhaps too the different depth of the Glass together with the more or less free access of Air ought to be attended to in this af fair But thus much for the circumstances of the expe riment The only use of it I can at present find will be to estimate moisture and dryness in the Air which is evident ly suggested by this following observation That when the505 the Oyl of Vitriol is satiated in the moistest weather it afterward retains or looses its acquired weight as the Air proves more or less moist Thus the one grain above mentiond after its full Increase often varid its equilibrium viz in dry wea ther the weights in moist the liquor did constantly preponderate and that so sensibly that the tongue of the Ballance of 1  Inch long describd an Arch of Variation to  of an Inch compass which Arch would have been 2  Inches had the tongue been but one foot in length even with that little quantity of Li quor so that if more Liquor expanded under a large Surface be usd the minutest alteration of wheather must needs very much more affect it and a bare pair of Scales will afford an Hygroscope as nice perhaps as any yet known This Ballance may be contrivd two ways either such whose pin should be in the middle of the Beam with a very slender tap ring tungue of a foot or one foot and a half long pointing to the divisions on a broad Arched plate fix t above in the handle according to figure the third in the Table or else the Scale with the Liquor may be hung to a point of the Beam very near the pin and the other extream made so long as to mark a large Arch on a board placd conveniently for that purpose as the fourth figure represents The Scale in ei ther may be a concave Glass of four or five Inch s Di ameter Lastly on the division of the Arches should be in scribd the different temperature of the Air shewn by the Liquor The fifth Figure gives the lineament of ano ther Hygroscope made of a Violstring running upon pullies and suspending a bullet fixt to the shorter end of an Index whose other extremity is so long as to describe a long Arch by the falling and rising of the Bullet upon the Sretching and Shrinking of the String K 2 which506 which would be more nice were the Index fastened to the center of the last pully An experiment very obvi ous but not taken notice of as I know by any writer and so I thought it not impertinent to be mentiond here among Hygroscopes But tis high time to conclude I shall only add this advertisement that whereas in this experiment only Oyl of Vitriol was imployd I have rea son to think that Oyl of Sulphur per Campanam as also Oyl of Tartar per deliquium and the Liquor of Fixt Nitre c may succeed as well however Sir I must leave the prosecution and improvement of this and such like observations to persons who have better instruments and more leasure for such matters than Your humble Servant W G Re

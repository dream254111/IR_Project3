j100276,Michigan Law Review,1271773,Vacation of Corporation Directors,i254449,NOTE AND COMMENT could plead only one defense to the same cause of action To do otherwise would violate the rule against duplicity This rule requiring him to choose one defense only where he had several it frequently happened that he failed to select the strongest and the rule came to be regarded as a harsh one This led to the enactment of the statute of 4 Anne which provided that it should be lawful for any defendant    in any action or suit    in any court of record with leave of court to plead as many several matters thereto as he shall think necessary for his defense This left the matter to the dis cretion of the court At first it seems that the judges would refuse leave when inconsistent pleas were tendered but subsequently granted it in all cases perhaps but those of general issue and tender It appears therefore that at common law the question of inconsistent pleas could not arise that under the statute of Anne the matter was wholly within discretion of the court when leave to file them was asked and that the practice finally obtained of allowing them in nearly all cases T A B VACATION OF CORPORATION DIRECTORSIn the case of Kavanaugh v The Commonwealth Trust Company decided by the Supreme Court of Sara toga County New York in September I909 VAN KIRK J rules upon some novel points relating to the duties of directors of trust companies in prevent ing the wasting of corporate assets The suit was brought by a shareholder to recover into the treasury of the trust company a sum of money as dam ages suffered by the loss of funds through the alleged negligence of the directors The loss occurred through the connection of the trust company then the Trust Company of the Republicwith the failure of that famous artistic swindle the United States Shipbuilding Company in I903 The trust company was organized in March I902 with Ioooooo capital stock 500000 surplus and a directorate that stood for strength and probity in the world of finance to operate largely in the new and lucrative field of meeting the needs of the southern cottongrowers Mr Dresser a merchant son of a merchant married into the Vanderbilt family but with no experi ence in high finance was chosen president About this time John W Young a promoter of projects of unvarying failure and Lewis Nixon the designer of the Oregon with the prospect of large ship subsidies from the probably successful efforts of Senators Frye and Hanna in congress dreamed of a shipbuilding trust to include the prin cipal shipbuilders of the country acquired options therefor and proposed to form a company to take them over The plan required about 8oo0ooo cash6oooooo to pay for properties and 2oooooo for working capital and commissions It was proposed to sell goooooo of first mortgage bonds for this purpose which should first be underwritten at 9oonethird in London onethird in Paris and onethird in the United States Through agreement and the offer of 67000 in cash 250000 in bonds and I4ooooo in the stock of the proposed company the stuff of Young and Nixons dream took on the appearance of established fact to Mr Dresser and the directors of the trust company and they agreed to issue the prospectus of the Ship Com pany and secure the underwriting of 3000000 of the bonds in the United 137MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW States This they easily did the London underwriting totally failed but Paris responded by underwriting 4250000by irresponsible parties as it afterward turned out The trust company undertook to secure the 1750000 additional to complete the 9oooooo and succeeded The prospectus of the ship building company was then put out by the trust companyfalse in sev eral particularsand books were opened for public subscriptions Not a penny was taken in Paris and only 49o000 in the United States The underwriters were then called onand only 25000 was received from Paris and a little over 2000000 from the United States The options would expire August 12 when 6ooo000 would be needed to take them up Mr Dresser without consulting the directors met the crisis in two ways I by loaning over 2000000 of the Trust Companys money to Mr Nixon much more than the law permitted to be loaned to one personupon the security of the Ship Company bonds 2 by depositing about 2oooooo of the Trust Companys money with various banks then borrowing the same from them on the joint note of himself and Mr Nixon secured by a deposit of double the amount in Ship Company bonds and the guaranty of the Trust Company No loss however occurred from these transactions as they were taken care of by a syndicate subsequently organized for that purpose They however were loans that prudent business men would not have made It is to be noted that these transactions occurred August 12 Exactly sim ilar transactionsexcessive loans to individuals including loans to Mr Dresser himself on the security of Ship Company bondsadvances of cash to other banks who loaned it to others on the security of Ship Company bonds and the guaranty of the Trust Companywere made by Mr Dresser in the latter part of August and during September October and November These resulted in the losses complained of The bylaws provided for 25 directors who were to meet the third Tues day of every month at which the minutes of the meetings of the executive committee were to be read The executive committee was to consist of six directors who were to meet every Tuesday Money could be deposited only in such banks as were designated by the executive committee and in the name of the Trust Company The bylaws also provided that this committee might authorize the president to make investments in securities and dispose of them without consulting the committee but all such transactions should be reported to the committee at its next meeting Neither the transactions of August 12 nor those of later date were re ported to the directors nor to the executive committee According to the bylaws the executive committee and the directors should have met on August I9 and the transactions of August 12 should have been reported to them then or they should have inquired what loans had been made This they did not do nor was it done because as it was argued the directors were doing as all good directors dotaking a vacation for their health and pleasureon August I9 If the executive committee and the board had conformed to the bylaws and had met August I9 and had examined the loans made August 12 they would have been put on their guard as to the reckless acts of the president 138NOTE AND COMMENT 139 and would have had warning of the probability or possibility of a repetition of the same The defendants did not in fact know of the acts of August I2 and the subsequent ones Ought they to have known Were they negligent in failing to know The Court says as to each director Was he warned and put on his guard by anything he knew or ought to have known If in the perform ance of his duties with the care and attention an ordinarily prudent man actuated by self interest would have given to his own business affairs he would have learned of the wrongful acts in time to have prevented them or lessened the loss then he was negligent in failing to know them The Court further specifies It is the custom and duty of directors to know of the loans of the bank or trust company Under the bylaws it was the duty of the executive committee to require all loans and investments to be re ported at its next meeting for approval to know of them then and of the directors to know of them at their next meeting If the loans were not then reported to them it was their duty to require them to be reported This duty is not lessened or discharged because they are informed there will be no regular meeting Such duty may be performed outside of regular meet ings If there is necessity for each director to act he may act by himself Where there is a duty to know failure to know is equivalent to actual knowl edge and failure to act If the directors see fit to entrust the business to officers chosen by them it is their personal trust and not the trust of the company itself or of the stockholders To do his duty as directors of other institutions of the same kind in the same city or community perform theirs is not sufficient A man cannot believe he may neglect his duty or do a wrongful act because other men to his knowledge have the habit While a prudent man takes a vacation he also at the time takes the risk of misman agement or misconduct while he is gone he is then not performing his duty to his business but exercising faith instead of performance There is no understanding that directors are to do their dutyexcept during vacation time While a director may be excused by the board or by very pressing business or by sickness or other necessity yet it is the duty of the board or of the executive committee to attend at the appointed time for a meeting and they cannot abdicate these duties and turn the company over to the execu tive officers without assuming liability for imprudent acts of such officers causing loss which they would have prevented had they attended to their duties Neither are directors excused because they have committed their duties to the executive committee If they rely on them it is their own reliance and their own risk They may delegate the work but not their responsibility As will be noted the Court applies the New York rule that directors are held to the same degree of care that men of common prudence exercise in their own affairs Hun v Cary I880 82 NY 65 37 Am R 546 Bos worth v Allen I9OI i68 N Y 157 85 Am St R 667 55 L R A 751 with note also Marshall v Farmers Bank I889 85 Va 676

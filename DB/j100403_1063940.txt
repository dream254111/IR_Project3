ACTION FOR HIS DEATH NTOTHING is better settled than that at common law the right of action for an injury to the person was extin guished by the death of the party injured The rule action per sonalis moritur cumn persona applied whether the death from the injury was instantaneous or notl This has been said to be one of the notable defects of the com mon law and although that system has been repeatedly lauded as the perfection of human reason it is worthy of note that the courts have been unable to assign any satisfactory reason for the rule It has been said that the reason is to be found in that natural and almost universal repugnance among enlightened na tions to setting a price upon human life or any attempt to esti mate its value by a pecuniary standard a repugnance which seems to have been strong and prevalent among nations in pro portion as they have been or become more enlightened and re fined2 It has been frequently suggested that the rule is founded upon the theory that because at common law an act which caused death was a felony the civil cause of action was merged in the crim inal offense In Green v Huds6n River R Co3 Seward J said It is of no practical utility to search for the reason of the rule It remains somewhat obscure Whether it arose from 1 Michigan Central R Co v Vreeland 227 U S 59 2 Hyatt v Adams 16 Mich 180 s2 Keyes N Y 294VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW the sentimental reason that the destruction of life by negli gence was an injury that cannot be compensated in damages or from the policy of the law to secure the greater safety of life and limbs by merging the right to damages by a civil action in the felony resulting from the killing of a human being by the negligent act of another thus insuring the cooperation of the next of kin as may be supposed in the vigorous prosecution of the criminal and preventing the composition or settlement of such offense as I am inclined to believe it is now of little consequence to inquire It was first distinctly announced in the case of Baker v Bolton et al4 in which the plaintiff brought an action against the pro prietors of a stage coach that was overturned while he and his wife were traveling in it whereby he was much bruised and his wife so severely hurt that she died about a month after The declaration alleged besides other special damage that by means of the premises the plaintiff had wholly lost and been deprived of the comfort fellowship and assistance of his said wife and had from thence and hitherto suffered and undergone great grief and vexation and anguish of mind Lord Ellenborough held that the jury could take into con sideration only the bruises which the plaintiff had sustained and the loss of his wifes society and the distress of mind that he had suffered on her account from the time of the accident to the time of her death And he announced the principle of his de cision in the following celebrated dictum In a civil court the death of a human being cannot be com plained of as an injury It seems to be generally conceded that the commonlaw rule has for its basis and ifoundation only this dogmatic utterance It was also a rule of the common law that even though a person injured could sue and recover damages therefor if he should die without instituting suit or before a hearing could be had the cause of action died with him The result was that there could be no recovery whatsoever for injuries producing death except where the injured person prosecuted his action to a final judgment before his death ensued Statutes providing for 1 Camp 493 578EFFECT OF RECOVERY AS BAR TO ACTION the survival of causes of action for injury to person and property have been generally adopted with the result that such damages as were sustained by a decedent by reason of injuries inflicted upon him can be recovered by his administrator either through a new action instituted after his death or a revival of an action commenced by him in his life time Inasmuch however as one does not suffer pecuniary damage by reason of his own death such actions are limited to a recovery of damages for pain and suffering medical expenses loss of occupation etc It was not until the enactment by the English Parliament in 1846 of the famous statute known as Lord Campbells Act which is the prototype of practically all Amierican legislation on the subject that actions were permitted to be maintained by personal representatives or heirs of a decedent for damages for his death when caused by wrongful act Inasmuch as in many important particulars the exact verbiage of this act has been brought forward into the various American statutes it is given herewith substantially in full Section 1 Whensoever the death of a person shall be caused by wrongful act neglect or default and the act neglect or default is such as would if death had not ensued have en titled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof then and in every such case the person who would have been liable if death had not en sued shall be liable to an action for damages notwithstand ing the death of the person injured and although the death shall have been caused under such circumstances as would amount in law to felony Section 2 Every action shall be for the benefit of the wife husband parent and child of the person whose death shall have been so caused and shall be brought by and in the name of the executor or administrator of the person deceased and in every such action the jury may give such damages as they may think proportioned to the injury re sulting from such death to the parties respectively for whom and for whose benefit such action shall be brought and the amount so recovered after deducting the costs in recovering from the defendant shall be divided among the beforementioned parties in such shares as the jury by their verdict shall find and direct Section 3 Provided always that not more than one 579VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW action shall lie for and in respect of the same subjectmat ter of complaint and that every such action shall be com menced within twelve calendar months after the death of such deceased person5 It was held by the English courts soon after the passage of this act that it created an entirely new and distinct action Coleridge J said in one of the first cases This act does not transfer this right of action to his repre sentatives but gives to his representatives a totally new right of action on different principles In Seward v The Vera Cruz7 Lord Blackburn said A totally new action is given against the person who would have been responsible to the deceased if the deceased had lived an action which is new in its species new in its quality new in its principles in every way new and which can only be brought if there is any person answering the description of the widow parent or child who under such circumstances suffers pecuniary loss Much confusion of thought has arisen and is manifested both in the opinions of the courts and in the textbooks as to the true relation one to another of the new and independent cause of action thus given for damages caused by death and the right of the injured person transmitted by the survival stat utes to recover the damages sustained by him prior to his death The question has been many times presented for determination whether a recovery under one statute bars a recovery under the other There are many cases both English and American which hold that where one is injured and after lingering some time dies separate actions can be maintained by his administrator under a survival statute for the damages suffered by him prior to his death and as the representative or trustee of the heirs at law under Lord Campbells Act and similar statutes for the dam ages suffered by them because of the death itself Some few courts have been misled by these cases into holding that under such circumstances a recovery by the injured person in his life time or a release executed by him does not bar a suit after his 6 85 Stat at Large p 693 9  10 Vict c 93 6 Blake v Midland R Co 18 Q B 93 7 10 App Cas 59 580EFFECT OF RECOVERY AS BAR TO ACTION death for damages by reason of his death and it is the purpose of this article to show that the two classes of cases depend upon wholly distinct principles and are solvable upon entirely dif ferent reasons Section 2 of Lord Campbells Act limits the damages which may be recovered for injuries producing death to such dam ages as they the jury may think proportioned to the injury resulting from such death to the parties respectively for whom and for whose benefit such action shall be brought It is thus evident ifrom the very language of the statute that no damages can be awarded except to compensate those de pendent upon the decedent for the loss suffered by them by reason of his death Some of the statutes authorize such suits to be brought in the name of the personal representative as the representative not of the decedent but of the heirs while others require that the heirs themselves sue but in either event the recovery is based upon the same element of damage It is manifest that the heirs or dependents suffer no legal damages by reason of the pain or suffering of the injured person or the expenses of his sickness and it has therefore been many times held that these things cannot be recovered for under Lord Campbells Act In the recent case of Michigan Central R Co v Vreeland8 the Supreme Court of the United States pointed out that under the Federal Employers Liability Act as originally enacted there was no provision for any survival of the right of action created in behalf of an injured employee for the damages suffered by him in his life time and that such cause of action was therefore extinguished by his death It was shown that the act is strik ingly similar to Lord Campbells Act that it is independent of any cause of action which the decedent had and includes no damages which he might have recovered for his injury if he had survived It is one beyond that which the decedent had one proceeding upon altogether different principles It is a liability for the loss and damage sustained by relatives dependent upon the decedent It is therefore a liability for the pecuniary damage resulting to them and for that only  Supra 581VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW In Blake v Midland R Co9 it was early held that in assess ing damages under Lord Campbells Act the jury could not take into consideration the mental suffering of the plaintiff for the loss of her husband but that they must be limited strictly to the pecuniary loss suffered by her because of his death This principle has been applied by nearly all of the American courts In some States however recent statutes have authorized the recovery in one action of all damages which the injured person himself suffered and those which accrued to his dependent heirs by reason of his death For the reason therefore that the damages recoverable under Lord Campbells Act and under the survival statutes are entirely separate and distinct the English courts had no difficulty in deciding that separate and distinct causes of action existed in which the two classes of damages might be recovered10 It is manifest that such a holding is necessary in order to permit the recovery of full damages for injuries producing death where an interval ensues between the infliction of the injuries and death If it be held that a recovery under Lord Campbells Act in which damages can only be awarded based upon the effect of the death upon the surviving dependents bars an action to recover the damages sustained by the decedent him self because of his pain and suffering and otherwise it is manifest that the guilty defendant will have wholly escaped the conse quences of the wrongful injury insofar as the injured person himself was concerned While therefore some courts have held that the two actions cannot both be maintained the vast weight of authority is to the contrary One of the leading cases on the subject is that of Brown v Chicago  Northwestern R Co1l in which the court reviewed nearly all of the cases Eng lish and American and reached the conclusion that there was no inconsistency between the two actions Another leading case 9 Supra J Blake v Railroad Co 10 Eng Law  Eq 443 Leggott v

102 Wis 137 78 N W 771 582EFFECT OF RECOVERY AS BAR TO ACTION to the same effect in Steward v United Electric Light  Power Co12 in which the Maryland Court of Appeals reviewed at length the various cases and forcibly pointed out that there is nothing incongruous or contrary to fixed legal principles in the assertion that the same wrongful or negligent act might give rise to two separate causes of action if different injuries have been inflicted by it on different persons and that it is the con currence of the act and the injury resulting from it which con stitutes the causes of action that the same act might injure different individuals in different ways and that there is there fore no reason why these different individuals should not have separate actions for the recovery of the damages sustained by them respectively even though these damages flow directly from the same cause In Sutherland on Damages13 it is said that The actions thus provided for give damages mostly of a different nature and it would seem quite consistent with the policy of the statutes if not necessary to their natural force and operation to allow both classes of damages To hold otherwise if death ensues from the personal injury for which the injured person has a right of action is unwarrantably to restrict the operation of the statute There is nothing on the face of these statutes to make one operate to repeal the other or to require election under which the action should be brought with the effect of renouncing the right given by the other14 While there are some decisions to the contrary it is believed that the vast weight of authority both in England and in this country is to the effect that by reason of the different nature of the damages which are recoverable under survival statutes and under Lord Campbells Act different causes of action are created which can be proceeded with concurrently This is always subject to the condition however that the deceased has done nothing in his lifetime to extinguish both causes of ac 1 104 Md 332 65 Atl 49 13 Vol 4  1260 14 This principle has been enunciated in V  M R Co v Philips 64 Miss 693 Davis v Railroad 53 Ark 117 Hrust v Detroit City R Co 84 Mich 539 Connors v Burlington R Co 71 Iowa 490 Put nam v So Pac R Co 21 Ore 230 Belding v Black Hills etc R Co 3 S D 369 Bowes v Boston 155 Mass 314 and in other cases 583VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW tion and thus to prevent any recovery being had by reason of the wrongful act which produced his injuries and his subse quent death Of course where death is instantaneous no such question can arise for in that case inasmuch as the decedent has himself suffered no legal damages such as physical and mental pain and anguish loss of earning capacity outlays for medical expenses etc no cause of action is transmitted to his personal representative under the survival statutes the only cause of action being that founded upon Lord Campbells Act in which damages for the death alone are recoverable On the other hand as suits for death by wrongful act are designed only to recompense the heirs and dependents of the decedent for the loss suffered by them by reason of his death and the depriva tion of his care and support it is immaterial whether or not death resulted instantaneously from the injuries Some years after the rendition of the decision in Blake v Railway Co15 in 1852 and in which and the subsequent English cases theretofore cited the rule was announced that Lord Camp bells Act created a new separate and distinct cause of action from the one theretofore existing in favor of the injured person himself the contention was advanced that these new causes of action could not be defeated or surrendered by the injured per son either by executing a release of all damages sustained or re covering a judgment therefore in his lifetime It was argued that such persons had no interest in or control over actions under Lord Campbells Act that it was not enacted for their benefit did not become effective until after their death and was designed for the protection of their Ifamilies The reasoning of the cases above cited as holding that an administrator can recover in one action the damages sustained by an injured person and in an other those suffered by his heirs by reason of his death was sought to be applied In Read v Railway Co16 which was an action under Lord Campbells Act it was held however that the plea of accord and satisfaction with the deceased in his lifetime was good Blackburn J thought it necessary to qualify the declarations of the earlier cases by saying that the 584 16 Supra l L R 3 Q B 555EFFECT OF RECOVERY AS BAR TO ACTION action provided by Lord Campbells Act is not new in the sense that there is an independent cause of action vested in the representatives of the deceased in their own right He con tinued I think it the statute meant to say that if the party injured had not in his lifetime received compensation the de fendant would be liable to an action by the executor or relatives for the loss which they had sustained from his death This decision was construed in the subsequent case of Griffiths v Earl of Dudley17 as a clear decision that Lord Campbells Act did not give any new cause of action but only substituted the right of the representative to sue in the place of the right which the deceased himself would have had if he had survived These cases have been followed in subsequent English decisions and the law is now firmly established in that jurisdiction that a release executed or recovery had by an injured person in his lifetime bars an action by his heirs under Lord Campbells Act These cases have been many times cited as being in conflict with Blake v Railway Co18 and those in which it has been followed and it is submitted that if regard be had not to the conclusion reached but to the reasoning upon which it is based there is some just ground for this idea It is hard to reconcile the statement in Read v Railway Co that it was not the inten tion of the English statutes to make the wrongdoer pay twice for the same injury with the holding in Blake v Railway Co that where no action is had or taken by the deceased in his lifetime the wrongdoer can be made to pay twice once in a suit by the administrator under the survival statute for the injuries sustained by the decedent in his lifetime and again by the administrator in an action under Lord Campbells Act for damages for the death There is just as much a double re covery in this case as where if a person obtained judgment for injuries suffered by him and subsequently died of those injuries his personal representatives were thereafter permitted to recover damages for his death Again it is impossible to harmonize the statement in Griffiths T 9 Q B D 357 s Supra 585VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW v Earl of Dudley that Lord Campbells Act did not give any new cause of action whatsoever but only substituted the right of the representative to sue in the place of the right which the deceased himself would have had if he had survived with the precise and elaborate statement in the prior cases that an en tirely new and different cause of action was in ifact created The apparent conflict in these cases and the impossibility of recon ciling the language used has given rise to much of the confu sion which is to be found in the textbooks and the adjudicated cases as to the proper construction of statutes founded on Lord Campbells Act By reason of the fact that they in most in stances bear so close a resemblance thereto the American courts in construing them have properly paid great deference to the decisions of the English courts and the cases from which the above quotations have been given may be found cited in nearly all of the American decisions Although the language used in these opinions is as has been said conflicting and in some particu lars irreconcilable there is no real inconsistency in holding that where a person is injured and dies without executing a re lease or recovering damages his administrator can recover such damages as he himself might have recovered in his lifetime and can also on behalf of his dependent heirs obtain judgment for damages for his death and in the conclusion that if the de ceased in his lifetime has done anything to extinguish the entire cause of action the effect will be to bar a proceeding for dam ages after his death It is submitted that the question of whether or not Lord Campbells Act created a wholly new and distinct cause of action is not at all controlling in determining the effect of a release or recovery by the deceased in his lifetime but that this problem can properly be solved only by resort to the language of the act itself The new right which was given to sue for damages resulting from the death of injured persons was expressly limited to such cases as would if death had not ensued have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof It will be seen there fore that whether or not the new right was a continuation as has sometimes been claimed of the right existing in the injured person or entirely new separate and distinct it was granted upon 586EFFECT OF RECOVERY AS BAR TO ACTION a condition and could only come into being and be availed of when that condition existed No right was conferred to sue under all circumstances for damages for death resulting from injuries received If this had been done it would indeed have conferred a radically new and different cause of action which would have existed whether or not the death had been caused by the wrongful act of any other person The purpose of the statute was to award insofar as might be a pecuniary recom pense for death where it resulted from such injuries as under existing law would warrant a suit by the injured person for the damages suffered by him It was therefore expressly condi tioned that the circumstances must be such as would uphold an action by the deceased person If anything in the relation existing between him and the person who was responsible for the infliction of the injuries had the effect to preclude him from maintaining an action therefor under the precise terms of the statute it would likewise result in preventing a suit for his death Where for instance death results from negligence the question to be determined in each instance is whether or not the negligence was such that the party injured might have maintained an action and its solution will necessarily depend primarily upon the relation borne by the defendant to the in jured party in order that it may be determined whether the neglect was in respect to any duty owing by the former to the latter According to the circumstances of the particular case the answer may depend upon the law of master and servant of passenger and carrier of landlord and tenant or vendor and purchaser upon the law in respect to the liability of the owners of propertyof every description for injuries arising from its use upon the law of highways of municipal corporations in short upon any one of the many branches of the law that are commonly treated of in works upon negligence 19 In jurisdictions where contributory negligence may be pleaded in bar of actions for personal injuries the existence of such negligence by the deceased will likewise bar an action for dam ages for his death and if the injuries be the result of a risk 10 Tiffany on Death by Wrongful Act  65 587VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW assumed by the injured person his heirs will be prejudiced to precisely the same extent as he would be in a suit brought by him This has been many times held and as has been said re sults necessarily from the language of the statute itself and from the manifest end to be attained by it It was never intended to create new rules of liability in the sense that an act which theretofore was not wrongful because it was characterized by no breach of duty should thereafter become so It was only in tended to create a remedy which did not then exist for a wrong which was already recognized as a wrong The conditions above referred to as having the effect of pre venting an action by the injured person himself and therefore barring one by his heirs for his death are those which have ex isted prior to or contemporaneously with the time when he re ceived his injuries Precisely the same reasoning however applies to anything which he may have done after the injuries were inflicted upon him which would have had the effect of pre venting him from exercising his right to demand damages for the wrong done him If after receiving his injuries he ex ecuted a release under such circumstances as would make it ef fectual for the purpose of extinguishing his right of action and preventing him from maintaining a suit for damages it is mani fest that the condition imposed by Lord Campbells Act could not be met and the new cause of action thereby created could not and would not come into being The circumstances would not then be such as to have enabled the injured person to have brought suit if death had not ensued and therefore no such ac tion could be instituted by his heirs Again if after receiving injuries a person should institute suit and recover damages and thereafter died as a result of the injuries the condition imposed by Lord Campbells Act could not be met for the same reason namely that the deceased in his lifetime had voluntarily cre ated such a situation as would disable him from maintaining an action if death had not ensued As was said by the Supreme Court of the United States in Michigan Railway Co v Vreeland20 as the foundation of the 20 Supra 588EFFECT OF RECOVERY AS BAR TO ACTION right of action is the original wrongful injury to the decedent it has been generally held that the new action is a right depend ent upon the existence of a right in the decedent immediately before his death to have maintained an action for his wrongful injury Almost the same language as used in Hecht v Rail way Co21 where it was again emphasized that in order for the new remedy to become effective there must have existed a right of action in the injured person at the very instant of his death This has been many times decided but it does not seem to have been generally noted as marking the difference between the conclusion so often announced that an action by an administrator for the damages suffered by an in jured person in his lifetime does not bar an action by his heirs for his death and the almost unanimous holding that a recovery by an injured person in his lifetime does bar such an action for damages for his death The author of the very excellent work on Death by Wrong ful Act heretofore cited seems clearly to have overlooked the very obvious distinction between the two classes of cases He correctly announces the general rule that a release or recovery by a decedent in his lifetime bars a subsequent action by his heirs but expresses the belief that there is some inconsistency between the cases holding this and those holding that separate actions can be brought under the general survival statutes for in juries sustained by a decedent in his lifetime and under Lord Campbells Act for damages suffered by his heirs on account of his death22 In dicussing the two classes of cases he says that certainly there is an apparent inconsistency in holding that the recovery of judg ment by the party injured is a bar and that the recovery by an administrator upon the identical cause of action is no bar in an action for the death It is obvious that there is no apparent inconsistency whatsoever for the reason that where the injured party himself has recovered damages or given a release fur ther action under Lord Campbells Act cannot be had because 2 132 Ind 507 32 N E 302 Tiffany on Death by Wrongful Act  127 2 589VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW of the condition imposed that before it can be invoked it must appear that the decedent was at the very instant of his death in a position to sue if he had not died On the other hand where an injured party dies without bringing suit or effecting a re covery the condition of the statute can be met because under its literal terms he could if he had not died have maintained an action It was pointed out by the New York Court of Appeals in Littlewood v Mayor23 that there is in fact no conflict between the two classes of decisions particular reference being had to the English cases above referred to After citing Blake v Rail way Co24 and other similar cases and contrasting them with Read v Railway Co25 and Griffiths v Earl of Dudley26 it was shown that in none of the former cases had the deceased re covered damages for the personal injury from which death en sued and that therefore the question was not involved in any of them whether Lord Campbells Act applied to a case where such a recovery had been had that the action was brought by the representative as such for the cause of action claimed to have survived and was held to have had no connection with and not to be affected by an action under Lord Campbells Act which was founded upon a personal injury for which no cause of ac tion survived It was held that there was no inconsistency what soever between these cases and the subsequent ones holding that a release or recovery by the injured party in his lifetime barred a subsequent suit for his death Several of the encyclopaedias and textbooks and a number of judicial opinions state that there is considerable contrariety of opinion as to whether or not a release or recovery by a decedent in his lifetime bars an action by his heirs at law for his death and it is believed that these announcements are the result of a failure to distinguish between suits instituted by administrators under the survival statutes which as has been shown are gen erally held not to bar actions under Lord Campbells Act and those instituted by the injured person in his lifetime and pros ecuted to judgment As a matter of fact there are few ques  89 N Y 24 25 Supra 4 Supra 26 Supra 590EFFECT OF RECOVERY AS BAR TO ACTION tions as to which the courts are more thoroughly harmonized than whether or not a judgment in such an action or a release bars such a subsequent suit A careful examination of the au thorities leads to the belief that no court has in construing a statute founded on Lord Campbells Act squarely held that the effect of such a release or recovery is not to bar an action for the death Inasmuch as nearly all of the American statutes which create a right of action for injuries producing death con tain the condition imposed by Lord Campbells Act that the cir cumstances must be such that the injured person would have had the right to sue if death had not ensued it is difficult to see how there could be any great diversity of opinion In the recent case of Perry v Railroad Co27 the Superior Court of Delaware carefully reviewed all of the authorities English and American and reached the conclusion that there is no doubt whatsoever as to the result of a release or recovery by the decedent as a bar to an action by his heirs for his death The same conclusion was reached by the Georgia Court in the case of Southern Bell Telephone Co v Cassn28 in which the statement is made that although the question has many times been presented to the courts for decision the contrary has never been held except in Massachusetts and Kentucky The Massa chusetts statutes however are almost wholly dissimilar from Lord Campbells Act in that they provide for the imposition of fines for the benefit of those whose breadwinners have suffered death by wrongful act It is held therefore that a recovery in a commonlaw action of compensation by an injured person for the injury suffered by him in no way bars the imposition of such penalties Of course there is here no such condition as that imposed by Lord Campbells Act that as a prerequisite to its operation the right to sue for damages must exist in the decedent at the very instant of his death The Kentucky case referred to is no doubt that of Donahue v Drexler29 in which the statute giving a right of action for the death of a person killed by the careless wanton or malicious 2 24 Del 399 77 Atl 725 2 111 Ga 575 36 S E 881 2 82 Ky 157 591VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW use of firearms etc was applied and it was held that an action thereunder was not barred by a recovery had by the decedent in his lifetime The same observation may be made as to the sit uation presented to the Kentucky court as has been made as to the Massachusetts decisions The statute under construction contained no condition that the right to sue must have existed in the injured person at the time of his death In a recent decision 30 the Supreme Court of Louisiana has held that a recovery in the lifetime of a decedent did not bar an action for his death but here again the statute which author ized an action for damages for the death did not contain the same condition as appears in Lord Campbells Act It is sub mitted that none of these cases are in fact applicable where stat utes similar to Lord Campbells Act exist Another able and elaborate case is that of Hecht v Ohio Ry Co31 which upholds the effectiveness of the bar arising by rea son of a recovery in the lifetime of the injured person32 In Thompson on Negligence33 the rule is clearly announced that the right of action in the personal representative it has been held depends not only upon the character of the act from which death ensued but also upon the condition of the decedents claim at the time of his death If the claim was in such a shape that he could not have enforced it had death not ensued the statute gives the executors no right of action and creates no li ability whatever on the part of the person inflicting the injury Therefore where in an action by the personal representative of an injured person to recover damages for his death because of a 80 Dougherty v N O Ry  Light Co 63 So 493 s1 132 Ind 507 32 To the same effect see Brown v Electric Ry Co

act of the defendants it was shown that the defend ants had settled with the deceased in his lifetime and paid him the amount of his claim on account of the injury it was held that this would bar the plaintiffs action It is believed that the foregoing authorities to which others might be added fully substantiate the statement that there is no real conflict in the American cases upon the question now under discussion It has already been shown that the English courts have reached the same conclusion as those of this country and the same is true of the Canadian courts In Canadian Pacific R Co v Robinson34 it was pointed out that an action under the Ca nadian statute was of the same nature and indeed the same ac tion in all respects as that conferred by Lord Campbells Act and that it must as an action on that statute is construed in England be deemed to be a new action but still one dependent on the condition that the action of the deceased had not at the time of his death been barred or extinguished In the case of Robinson v Ry Co which arose in Canada and was decided by the House of Lords in 1892 the same doctrine was announced A question analogous to the one heretofore discussed arises where a person is injured and brings suit for the damages suf fered by him and thereafter dies and his administrator revives the suit under a survival statute and institutes another suit as the representative or trustee of the heirs at law to recover dam ages for the death Only two cases dealing with this question have come under the writers observation In Legg v Brit ton35 the Supreme Court of Vermont reached the conclusion that no substantial distinction can be drawn between such cases and those where an action was instituted by the decedent and a recovery was had prior to his death It was held that although the injured person might die after the institution of the suit and that a recovery therein should be had by the executor or ad ministrator the recovery would be in the right of the intestate while living and in legal effect would antedate his death and ex haust his right of action and that nothing would remain to sur vive for a subsequent action for the death It was said that such 593 M 54 Am  Eng Cases 49 35 64 Vt 652 24 Atl 1016VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW a proceeding would exhaust the entire liability of the wrongdoer and that no liability whatsoever would remain to be enforced in any action This is believed to be a correct decision On the other hand in Mahoning Valley R Co v Van Al stine36 the Supreme Court of Ohio reached precisely the oppo site conclusion The condition imposed as precedent to the in stitution of a suit for damages for death by wrongful act that the right to sue must have existed in the injured person at the time of his death was not alluded to and the decision was jus tified only upon the ground that separate causes of action were presented in behalf of the injured person in an action for his own damages and in his heirs to recover damages for the death It is interesting to note in conclusion how entirely tlie reluc tance which was manifested by the courts in applying the com mon law to place a value upon human life has been overcome by modern legislation and modern judicial thought Indeed it is not true that Lord Campbells Act undertook to place a value upon human life Its sole purpose was to afford a pecuniary recompense to those dependent upon one whose death had been caused by the wrongful act of another for the loss and depriva tion which ensued to them by reason thereof The preamble recites that Whereas no action at law is now maintainable against a person who by his wrongful act neglect or default may have caused the death of another person and it is oftentimes right and expedient that the wrongdoer in such case should be answerable in damages for the injury so caused by him etc Section 2 moreover provides that in every such case the jury may give such damages as they may think proportioned to the injury resulting from such death to the parties injured respec tively for whom and for whose benefit such action shall be brought It has been many times held that under this statute no recov ery can be had by any person who has not been pecuniarily dam aged and that the amount to be recovered is determined not by the value of the life of the deceased person but by the amount of damages which has accrued to the plaintiffs thereby The same rule has been incorporated in the Federal Employers Act and 36 77 Ohio St 395 83 N E 601 594EFFECT OF RECOVERY AS BAR TO ACTION it has been held that the pecuniary loss is not dependent upon any legal liability of the injured person to the beneficiary but that there must be some reasonable expectation of pecuniary as sistance or support of which the plaintiff had been deprived and that compensation for such loss manifestly does not include dam ages by way of recompense for grief or wounded feelings37 On the other hand the statutes of many if not most of the States now proceed upon the theory that wherever death is caused by wrongful act the wrongdoer must pay damages to the extent of the value of the life which has been taken even though no one is in existence who has been pecuniarily damaged thereby Thus most statutes provide that recoveries for death by wrongful act may be had for the benefit of the heirs at law without regard to their dependence upon the decedent and some go even so far as expressly to provide that if there are no heirs at law a recovery may be had by the administrator for the benefit of the estate Again the element of compensation is wholly lost sight of in the common provision that damages shall be distributed in accordance with the rules which control the distribution of the assets of a deceased person Such provisions frequently work great hardship by reason of the fact that the grown children of a decedent who may be fully selfsupporting and in no way dependent share to the same extent in damages recovered for his death as his widow and minor children The tendency is also manifested where the relationship of master and servant exists to create liability without regard to whether or not death was caused by any wrongful act whatso ever Many of the leading States now have employees compen sation acts which have this effect When such statutes shall have been generally adopted and recoveries may therefore be had for injuries producing death without regard to whether or not such injuries have been wrongfully inflicted and whether or not any person whomsoever has been damaged in a legal sense Lord Campbells Act will have been as radically departed from as was the common law by its enactment O W Catchings VICKSBURG MISS 37 Michigan Ry Co v Vreeland supra 595

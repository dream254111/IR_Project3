instance could arise under the operation of such a rule where such a thing as property not within the custody of the court would exist That such would be the result is adequately illustrated in the application of this theory to the principal case where the property was in the possession of a third person the defendant and the bankrupt as well as the plaintiff had merely a claim against it Clearly then since the amendment gives the trustee in such a case only the interest of a judgment creditor with execution leturned unsatisfied the plaintiffs lien should prevail STATUTORY LIABILITY OF STOCKHOLDERS FOR INTERESTIt has been frequently stated that as a general rule after the property of an in solvent corporation has passed into the hands of a receiver interest is no longer allowed to accrue on the claims against the fundl The truth of this statement is not due to the obligations having in any way lost their interestbearing quality but results from the purely prac tical consideration that in the case of receiverships the assets usually are inadequate to satisfy all claims As was recently pointed out by the Supreme Court2 it would be manifestly absurd to contemplate that by securing the appointment of a receiver the debtor or trustee could stop the running of interest on claims of the highest dignity Of course interest will never be computed on preferred claims to the prejudice of the claims of unpreferred creditors3 and indeed whenever the funds are insufficient it will not be allowed to accrue after the property passes in custodiam legis4 On the other hand it is equally well recognized that where the assets of an insolvent corporation either through good fortune or good management prove ample to meet all its obligations in full interest as well as principal will be paid5 It is quite obvious that where the statutory liability of the stock holders of a corporation is unlimited each being bound to pay his pro portionate share of the entire corporate debt their liability is com mensurate with that of the corporation and hence properly includes interest which merely compensates creditors for unjust delay and is as much a part of the debt as the principal itself6 Furthermore as was held in the recent case of Lamar v Taylor Ga 1914 80 S E 1085 even where the liability of the stockholders is limited to a fixed amount interest will be added to the principal of the debt provided that the total does not exceed the statutory limit In two decisions which are frequently cited as being in conflict with this doctrine the view was expressed that the shareholders liability did not properly ex Thomas v Western Car Co I893 I49 U S 95 Tredegar Co v Seaboard Air Line Ry C C A 19IO 183 Fed 289 American Iron  Steel Mfg Co v Seaboard

under a peculiar statute which provided not for the payment of all corporate debts but for the redemption of unpaid corporate bills at par and hence could not be fairly construed to contemplate interest of which no mention was made8 The rule laid down in Lamar v Taylor seems therefore to stand unchallenged and is certainly supported by an overwhelming preponderance of judicial opinion9 Moreover where a stockholder refuses to pay on demand and causes a creditor delay in enforcing his rights it is held in most jurisdictions that interest will run on the claim against the shareholder even though this results in increasing his total liability beyond the amount fixed by law10 Several courts have denied this principle on the ground that the liability of the stockholders is to be sought in the statute alone and the latter must be strictly construed11 On the other hand the rule that when a stockholder contests the creditors claims interest will accrue on the amount of his obligation from the date of the commence ment of the action against himl2 or in the case of national banks from the date fixed for payment by the Comptroller of the Currency13 or in short from the moment the liability becomes liquidatedl4 seems only just and reasonable If the stockholder pays his liability as soon as the amount thereof is ascertained he obtains a complete discharge5 and interest even when it is in excess of the fixed limit is imposed solely in order to compensate the creditors for the loss of the use of their money6 It would seem therefore that the statutes imposing this liability are of a compensatory rather than of a penal nature and consequently may be broadly construed ADMIssION OF DYIGO DECLARATIONSDying declarations were ad mitted originally in all cases

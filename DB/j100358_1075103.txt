J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1075103,DRAWING AS A SUBJECT FOR COLLEGE ENTRANCE CREDIT,I244551,DRAWING AS A SUBJECT FOR COLLEGE ENTRANCE CREDIT THE COLLEGE SEEKS TO PERPETUATE ITS OWN IDEALS THESE IDEALS HAVE FOUND EXPRESSION IN THE CURRICULUM THIS HAS CHANGED FROM TIME TO TIME BUT THE CHANGES HAVE NOT KEPT PACE WITH THE EVO LUTION OF SOCIETY HENCE WHENEVER A NEW SUBJECT GETS RECOGNI TION FROM THE COLLEGE IT IS THE RESULT OF A NEW DEMAND IN SOCIETY AND THE INITIATIVE IS TAKEN NOT BY THE COLLEGE BUT BY THE LOWER SCHOOL WHICH IS IN CLOSER TOUCH WITH THE PEOPLE THE COLLEGE AT FIRST SEEMS DEAF TO SUCH A DEMAND BUT GRADUALLY AS THE PRESSURE INCREASES THE COLLEGE MODIFIES ITS CURRICULUM AND SO THE PRO CESS GOES ON THE COLLEGE YIELDING ONLY TO PRESSURE WHAT IS TRUE OF THE COLLEGE CURRICULUM IS TRUE OF ITS REQUIRE MENTS FOR ADMISSION THE COLLEGE WANTS ITS STUDENTS PREPARED IN THE FULLEST POSSIBLE DEGREE TO PURSUE THE PARTICULAR STUDIES IT OFFERS WHEN THE COLLEGE EMPHASIZES CLASSICS AND MATHEMATICS IN ITS CURRICULUM CLASSICS AND MATHEMATICS ARE EMPHASIZED IN ITS REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMISSION WHEN SCIENCE AND GOVERNMENT ARE ALLOWED A LARGE PLACE IN THE CURRICULUM SCIENCE AND HISTORY ARE ACCORDED A PLACE IN THE PREPARATORY COURSE EVEN IF IT WERE GRANTED THAT THIS PRACTICE OF RESTRICTING THE PREPARATORY COURSE WAS THE WISEST FROM THE COLLEGE POINT OF VIEW WHICH MAY BE DOUBTED IT CERTAINLY DOES NOT ENCOURAGE THE BROADEST AND SOUNDEST SECONDARYSCHOOL TRAINING IT HAS BEEN MAINTAINED THAT THE BEST PREPARATION FOR COLLEGE AND THE BEST PREPARATION FOR LIFE FOR THOSE WHO CANNOT ATTEND COLLEGE AS WELL AS THOSE WHO CAN IS ONE AND THE SAME THING THE VERDICT OF HIGHSCHOOL TEACHERS AS SHOWN BY RECENT WRITINGS AND MODIFICATIONS OF THE SECONDARYSCHOOL CURRICULUM IS THAT THE NARROW PREPARATORY SCHOOL OF THE PAST IS NOT THE BEST THAT CAN BE GIVEN TO YOUNG MEN AND YOUNG WOMEN WHO GO FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL DIRECTLY INTO THEIR LIFEWORK ACCEPTING THIS VERDICT OF I READ AT THE CONFERENCE OF AFFILIATED AND COOPERATING SCHOOLS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO AUTUMN MEETING 1902 3ITHE SCHOOL REVIEW THE HIGHSCHOOL TEACHERS THEN IT FOLLOWS THAT IF THE CONTENTION THAT THE BEST PREPARATION FOR COLLEGE IS ALSO THE BEST PREPARA TION FOR LIFE IS WELL FOUNDED THE COLLEGE MUST MODIFY ITS REQUIREMENTS EVEN IF THIS CONTENTION IS NOT TRUE WOULD IT NOT BE GOOD EDUCATIONAL POLICY AS WELL AS GOOD PEDAGOGY FOR THE COLLEGE TO RECOGNIZE A WIDER RANGE OF SUBJECTS IN THE SEC ONDARY SCHOOL IS IT NOT POSSIBLE THAT THE COLLEGE WOULD BE THE GAINER IT WOULD THEN KEEP ITS HOLD UPON A LARGER PART OF THE CURRICULUM OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL  A HOLD WHICH IT IS LOSING AS FAST AS NEW SUBJECTS ARE INTRODUCED INTO THE SECONDARY SCHOOL AND THESE ARE INCREASING IN RESPONSE TO THE LEGITIMATE DEMANDS OF THE PEOPLE THE COLLEGE WOULD THEN INFLUENCE FAVORABLY THESE NEWER SUBJECTS GUARDING AGAINST A TOO NARROW UTILITARIANISM AND INSURING IN THEM A REASONABLE PERCENTAGE OF THE CULTURE ELEMENTS WE ARE ALL AWARE THAT MANY COLLEGES HAVE TAKEN AND ARE TAK ING STEPS IN THE DIRECTION HERE SUGGESTED ENCOURAGED BY THE MORE DEMOCRATIC SPIRIT OF THE UNIVERSITIES MANY OF THE COLLEGES HAVE COME TO RECOGNIZE SCIENTIFIC AND HISTORICAL STUDIES IN THIS CONNECTION IT IS INTERESTING TO KNOW THAT AT THE MEETING OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAMINATION BOARD OF THE MIDDLE STATES AND MARYLAND HELD NOVEMBER 9 I90O IT WAS VOTED TO ADD BOTANY GEOGRAPHY SPANISH AND DRAW ING TO THE LIST OF SUBJECTS IN WHICH EXAMINATIONS ARE HELD THIS WAS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE COLLEGES ACCEPTING THE EXAMINA TIONS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS WERE OF COURSE ALREADY ON THE LIST THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS TAKING THE EXAMINATIONS IN THESE NEW SUBJECTS LAST SUMMER WAS AS FOLLOWS IN BOTANY 5 GEOG RAPHY 6 SPANISH 9 AND DRAWING I36 AS ALREADY SUGGESTED THE ALLIMPORTANT QUESTION THAT AS A RULE THE COLLEGE HAS ASKED IN THE PAST WHEN SELECTING A SUBJECT FOR ENTRANCE CREDIT IS THIS  IS THIS SUBJECT A NECESSARY PART OF THE MOST DIRECT PREPARATION FOR THE WORK THAT THE STUDENT IS TO DO DURING HIS FOUR YEARS WITH US  IF NOT THIS SUBJECT IS LEFT OUT OF THE LIST UNDER THESE CONDITIONS SO FAR AS I KNOW DRAWING HAS FOUND NO PLACE AMONG SUBJECTS ACCEPTED FOR COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXCEPT RECENTLY IN SUCH CASES AS COLUMBIA IN THE SCHOOLS OF 32DRA WING AS SUBJECT FOR COLLEGE ENTRANCE CREDIT 33 ARCHITECTURE AND ENGINEERING AND HARVARD IN THE LAWRENCE SCIENTIFIC SCHOOL WHERE DEFINITE REQUIREMENTS IN DRAWING ARE MADE AND MINNESOTA WHERE DRAWING IS ALLOWED ENTRANCE CREDIT IN THE COLLEGES OF MINES AND ENGINEERING THIS REQUIREMENT AT HARVARD AND COLUMBIA HOWEVER IS FOR THE SAME REASON THAT THE OLDER SUBJECTS AS MATHEMATICS AND LATIN ARE REQUIRED IN THE CLASSICAL COLLEGE NAMELY TO ENABLE THE COLLEGE TO DO A HIGHER GRADE OF WORK IN THAT SUBJECT THERE IS NO APPARENT CONSIDERA TION OF THE SPECIAL NEEDS OF PUPILS OF SECONDARYSCHOOL AGE AND VERY LITTLE CONSIDERATION OF THE CULTURE VALUE OF THE SUBJECT TO STUDENTS OF THAT AGE THE AIM IS TO MASTER CERTAIN TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIESTHE GRAMMAR OF DRAWING IS NOT THE TIME AT HAND WHEN THE COLLEGE SHOULD RECOGNIZE DRAWING ON HIGHER GROUND THAN DIRECT TECHNICAL PREPARATION FOR COURSES IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING1 WHY SHOULD NOT THE COLLEGE IN DETERMINING WHETHER DRAWING OR ANY OTHER SUBJECT IS FIT TO RECEIVE ENTRANCE CREDIT ASK ALSO THE QUESTIONS WHAT IS ITS SOCIAL VALUE  OF WHAT PRACTICAL VALUE IS IT TO THE INDIVIDUAL  DOES IT POSSESS CULTURE ELEMENTS  IS IT A SUBJECT THAT BELONGS ESPECIALLY TO THE SECONDARY STAGE OF EDUCATION  WHEN ANSWERS TO SUCH QUESTIONS AS THESE ARE GIVEN THEIR DUE WEIGHT DRAWING WILL BE FOUND ON THE LIST OF CREDIT SUBJECTS DRAWING IS A MEANS OF EXPRESSION AUXILIARY TO SPEECH ITS DIRECTNESS AND ITS FORCE ARE RECOGNIZED MORE AND MORE AS PROOF OF THIS STATEMENT WE HAVE BUT TO CALL TO MIND THE RAPIDLY INCREAS ING USE OF DRAWINGS IN POPULAR BOOKS MAGAZINES SCIENTIFIC TREAT ISES ADVERTISING DEVICES AND THE DAILY NEWSPAPERS OFTEN THE DRAWINGS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE PRINTED WORDS THAT GO WITH THEM AS A MEANS OF EXPRESSION DRAWING IS MORE POINTED AND USUALLY FAR MORE EFFECTIVE THE MAN WHO HAS POWER TO USE BOTH DRAWING AND SPEECH EFFECTIVELY CAN MAKE A DOUBLE CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY AND HIS WORK IS SURE TO BE HARMONIOUS WHO HAS NOT BEEN IMPRESSED WITH THE PERFECTION OF EVEN THE SIMPLER PARTS OF THE WORKS OF WILLIAM HAMILTON GIBSON EITHER HIS DRAWING OR X JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY HAS TAKEN A NOTABLE STEP IN THIS DIRECTION BY REQUIRING ONE YEAR OF WORK IN DRAWING THREE HOURS A WEEK FOR THE DEGREE OF AB THIS MAY BE EITHER FREEHAND OR MECHANICALTHE SCHOOL REVIEW HIS WRITTEN LANGUAGE WOULD ATTRACT US BUT TOGETHER THEY BECOME A MASTERPIECE THE COLLEGE RECOGNIZES ONE OF THESE MEANS OF EXPRESSION WHY SHOULD IT NOT RECOGNIZE THE OTHER ALSO  BUT DRAWING IS A MEANS OF EXPRESSION AND COMMUNICATION APART FROM WRITTEN SPEECH IN BOTH THE INDUSTRIAL ARTS AND THE FINE ARTS IN MOST OF THE INDUSTRIAL ARTS DRAWING IS THE CHIEF MEANS OF TRANSMITTING FACTS OF DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION AND IN SOME OF THEM IT IS THE VERY FOUNDATION UPON WHICH EVERYTHING ELSE DEPENDS IT IS COMMON TO SPEAK OF A WORKING DRAWING AS A BUSINESS LETTER TO A MECHANIC WE SPEAK OF IT THUS BECAUSE IT MAY HAVE ALL THE GOOD POINTS OF A PERFECT BUSINESS LETTER IT MAY BE BRIEF DIRECT TO THE POINT FORCEFUL COMPREHENSIVE AND CLEAR IF MORE PEOPLE COULD WRITE SUCH BUSINESS LETTERS TO THE MECHANICS THEY EMPLOY THERE WOULD BE FEWER MISUNDERSTANDINGS IN THE WORLD AND LESS WASTE OF HUMAN ENERGY BY FRICTION BETWEEN THOSE WHO WANT THINGS AND THOSE WHO MAKE THEM IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT EVERY TRAINED MECHANIC EVERY ENGINEER AND ARCHI TECT MUST KNOW HOW TO DRAW BUT TOO SELDOM IS IT APPRECIATED HOW MUCH THE POWER TO DRAW IS NEEDED BY EVERY EDUCATED MAN HE NEEDS IT AS AN AUXILIARY TO SPEECH AS A MEANS OF TRANSMITTING THOUGHT CONCERNING THE INDUSTRIAL ARTS FOR EVERY MAN HAS WANTS WHICH MUST BE SUPPLIED BY THESE ARTS AND HE NEEDS IT ALSO IN HIS RECREATION MORE AND MORE SOME FORM OF HANDICRAFT IS BEING TAKEN UP PROFITABLY AS A MEANS OF RECREATION AFTER SEVERER MENTAL EFFORT VERY OFTEN THE VALUE AND THE DEGREE OF PLEASURE IN SUCH WORK DEPENDS UPON ABILITY TO DRAW BUT IT IS IN THE FINE ARTS THAT DRAWING REACHES ITS HIGHEST LEVEL HERE NOT ONLY FACTS OF FORM AND TONE ARE DEPICTED BUT HUMAN FEELINGS ARE EXPRESSED AND EVEN THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE INFINITE FATHER ARE BROUGHT BEFORE OUR VISION WHILE THIS HIGHEST LEVEL OF EXPRESSION THROUGH DRAWING CANNOT BE COMPASSED IN THE SEC ONDARY SCHOOL THE SCHOOL CAN REACH UP TOWARD ITCAN ENCOURAGE THE STUDENT ON IT CAN ALSO HELP HIM TO APPRECIATE THE WORKS OF THE MASTERS OF PAINTING AND SCULPTURE AND ARCHITECTURE NO ONE IS LIKELY TO CHALLENGE THE STATEMENT THAT IN AMERICA WE ARE IN GREAT NEED OF A FULLER AND FINER AND TRUER APPRECIATION OF WORKS OF ART NEXT TO POWER TO CREATE WE NEED THE POWER TO 34DRA WING AS SUBJECT FOR COLLEGE EN TRANCE CREDIT 35 APPRECIATE AND FOR THE MOST OF US THE LATTER IS FAR MORE IMPOR TANT THAN THE FORMER THE STUDY OF DRAWING AS AT PRESENT TAUGHT IN SOME OF THE BEST SECONDARY SCHOOLS OPENS THE DOOR TO AN APPRECIATION OF THE WORLDS GREAT MASTERPIECES TO DRAW UNDER THE DIRECTION OF A WISE TEACHER AN ANTEFIX TAKEN FROM THE PARTHE NON IS BUT AN INTRODUCTION TO A STUDY OF THE CROWNING GLORY OF GREEK ARCHITECTURE TO SKETCH ONE OF ITS PEDIMENT FIGURES OR TO STUDY THE COMPOSITION OF ITS FRIEZE IS TO BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH PHIDIAS AND TO LEARN OF THE AGE OF PERICLES COPYING THE LOTUS FLOWER OR THE WINGED GLOBE MAY SUGGEST A STUDY OF THE RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND THE COLOSSAL TEMPLES OF THE ANCIENT PHARAOHS FINDING OUT THE WINDINGS OF A MOORISH PANEL ORNAMENT MAY LURE ONE ON TO THE BEAUTIES OF THE ALHAMBRA DESIGNING A GRILLE MAY REVEAL THE SPIRIT OF THE CRAFTS AND GUILDS OF THE MIDDLE AGES SKETCHING A CLASSMATE EVEN WHO HAS TAKEN HIS TURN AS MODEL MAY LEAD TO A CRITICAL STUDY OF THE DRAWINGS OF REMBRANDT OR MICHAEL ANGELO DRAWING DOES NOTCERTAINLY NEED NOT AND SHOULD NOTSTOP WITH MERE TECHNIQUE IT REACHES OUT AND TOUCHES HISTORY LITERA TURE THE FINE ARTS AND RELIGION AND BECOMES AN IMPORTANT CUL TURE STUDY DRAWING IS ALSO A VALUABLE MEANS OF HANDANDEYE TRAINING AND AS SUCH IT BELONGS ESPECIALLY IN THE SECONDARY SCHOOL IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ITS CHIEF VALUE IS AS A MEANS OF EXPRESSION IN THE SECONDARY SCHOOL THE OBJECTS DRAWN ARE MORE FULLY AND ACCURATELY REPRESENTED TECHNIQUE BECOMES AN OBJECT AND THE RESULT IS MORE DEFINITE HANDANDEYE TRAINING BOTH THEORY AND PRACTICE HAVE POINTED OUT THAT AS HANDANDEYE TRAINING DRAW ING IS MORE VALUABLE IN THE SECONDARY SCHOOL THAN IN THE COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO HAVE NEVER DONE SERIOUS WORK IN DRAW ING BEFORE THEY REACH COLLEGE FIND GREATER DIFFICULTY IN LEARNING TO DRAW THAN THEY WOULD HAD THEY BEGUN IN THE SECONDARY SCHOOL TO SUMMARIZE DRAWING IS A FIT SUBJECT TO RECEIVE COLLEGE ENTRANCE CREDIT NOT MERELY IN CASES WHERE DRAWING IS TO BE PUR SUED IN THE COLLEGE BUT ALSO WHERE IT IS NOT DRAWING FURNISHES A MEANS OF EXPRESSION WHICH IS OF GREAT PRACTICAL VALUE TO THE INDIVIDUAL AND TO SOCIETY IT IS A MEANS OF CULTURE IT IS NEEDEDTHLE SCHOOL REVIEW IN EVERY SECONDARY SCHOOL EVERY COLLEGE STUDENT IS THE BETTER FITTED FOR HIS WORK FOR HAVING STUDIED IT FOR THESE REASONS THE COLLEGE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THOROUGH WORK IN DRAWING BY ALLOWING ENTRANCE CREDIT FOR IT THE EFFECT OF SUCH ACTION UPON THE SECONDARY SCHOOL WOULD BE TO ENCOURAGE IT TO BRING ITS WORK IN DRAWING UP TO A HIGHER STANDARD AND TO MAKE THIS STANDARD MORE NEARLY UNIFORM THROUGH OUT THE COUNTRY MORE STUDENTS WOULD TAKE DRAWING FOR THEY WOULD APPRECIATE ITS VALUE MUCH MORE THE EFFECT UPON THE COLLEGE ESPECIALLY WHERE A LIBERAL SYSTEM OF CREDIT IS IN VOGUE HARDLY WOULD BE APPRECIABLE STUDENTS PRESENTING DRAWING MIGHT BE A LITTLE SHORT IN ONE OR TWO OTHER SUBJECTS BUT WITH A FLEXIBLE CURRICULUM NO SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES WOULD ARISE GRADUALLY THE BROADER GENERAL PREPARATION WOULD BE APPRECIATED BY MOST OR ALL OF THE DEPARTMENTS OF THE COLLEGE WHILE SOME WOULD RECOG NIZE A DISTINCT AND DEFINITE ADVANTAGE ON ACCOUNT OF IT THE EFFECT UPON THE INDIVIDUAL STUDENT WHICH EFFECT OUGHT TO OUT WEIGH ALL OTHERS TOGETHER WOULD BE TO GIVE HIM MORE UNIVERSAL AND PERFECT MEANS OF EXPRESSION TO INCREASE HIS PRACTICAL POWER TO DEVELOP IN HIM A HIGHER APPRECIATION OF THE BEAUTIFUL TO GIVE HIM A FREER AND FULLER OPPORTUNITY TO FIND OUT HIS OWN APTITUDES AND THUS TO MAKE HIMSELF A MORE EFFICIENT MEMBER OF SOCIETY CHARLES A BENNETT BRADLEY POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE PEORIA ILL 36

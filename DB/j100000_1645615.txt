j100000,Science,1645615,On the Relations of Anthropology and Psychology,i296636,ON THE RELATIONS OF ANTHROPOL OGY AND PSYCHOLOGY IF we are to compare two objects and study their relations we will naturally want data as to their dimensions their composition and their observed influence upon each other In comparing two branches of science we should thoroughly know their scope the intrinsic work and the tendencies of each and their mu tual interplay and cooperation This stipu lates in the first place a clear definition of both of the lbranches concerned in the second a good acquaintance with teir workings and their possibilities and astly a possession of some satisfactory measure of the field of ac tivities of each of the two branches for direct comparison In considering the relations of anthropology and psychology the conditions just named are regrettably not all fulfillable We are fairly clear today as to the definition of scope and work done as well as doing and to be done in physical anthropology but we are less clear in these respects when it comes to other sub divisions of the  science of man and matters are even less isatisfactory when we approach psychology In a general way we all feel that psychology and anthropology are related The very ex istence of this joint Section as well as that of the joint committee of our two branches in the National Research Council are sufficient proofs of this feeling in thlis country at least We all know also that anthropological studies of human activities both in the far past and at present the studies of language belies ceremonies music and habits as well as the studies upon the human and animal brain and on the sense organs and their functions are 1 Address of the vicepresident and chairman of Setion

hand we are equally aware of the fact that many of the studies of the psychologists such as those on hereditary and group conditions land on behavior of primi tive peoples are of consideralble interest to anthropology But when we examine more closely into these relations we meet with vari ous setbacks and difficulties We soon see al though again only in a general way that the psychologists and anthropologists of whatever shade of color can and do exist quite independ ently that they actually work to ta very large extent unknown to each other that as time goes on they associate rather less than more at the colleges and universities that they pro gressively drift further apart in nomenclature methods land other respects and that in no im portant way are they really coming closer to gether No one I am isure would claim that if every anthropologist disappeared today psychology could not go on as well as it has hitherto and no one could claim on the other hand that ianthropology could not exist without the aid of psychology In our institutions the two branches proceed today as well known to all of us quite inde pendently Our great museums all have their departments of anthropology but none that of psychology while in some of the colleges in the War Departmeit and the Public Health Service matters are the reverse The publi cations of one of the branches are scarcely known to the workers in the other and bar ring rare exceptions there is no thought of ex changes references or mutual reviewing of literature The terminology is divergent in struments and methods differ our moist im portant international congresses and relations are wholly distinct at our meetings we mingle ollly through courtesy and habit and as has well been shown during the years of war there was no actual cooperation of the two branches in this greatest of contingencies and but little concern in one of what the other might be do ing or planning If the anthropologist takes up the list of psychological publications such as furnished by the Psychological Index he will note that as this proceeds from year to year it progressively drops reference to anthro pological publications and the same condi tion is observable in the anthropological bibli ographies in relation to what may be consid ered more strictly psychological work It is also known to you that for several years now increasingly strong efforts have been put forward from both sides to separate in this association anthropology from psychology and have each form its own section efforts which now have been successful Bearing all this in mind we can not help asking Is there really any relation of conse quence between modern anthropology and psy chology  There is indeed such a relation but it has never thus far been sufficiently defined and never as yet sufficiently exploited This rela tion is of such a nature that during the pre liminary and earlier work in both branches it could and had to be neglected but as psychol ogy progresses it will grow in strength to eventually become of importance I may be permitted in the first place to point out the areas of contact and interdigi tation of the two branches Unfortunately I meet here with the serious initial difficulty of defining psychology After striking this snag in the preparation of my address I turned to a series of the foremost representatives of your science for help and the help did not materialize Some of those appealed to would give no definition others would attempt it only circumstantially so that it was of little use for my purpose while the rest defined or inclined to define psychology as the  science of behavior which characteri zation does not iseem to be sufficiently compre hensive I then turned to the publications given in the last few volumes of the Psychological In dex and particularly the volume for 1918 which presumably is the most representative It gives 1585 titles Out of these I found so far as I could judge from the titles 14 per cent dealing with neurology and physiology 28 per cent dealing with neuropathology and psychiatry 65 per cent dealing with sociol ogy ethics and philosophy 25 per cent with 200 SCIENCEFEBRUARY 27 1920 religion mysticism and metaphysics 35 per cent of the titles were mixed and indefinite 4 per cent dealt with animal psychology 36 per cent with human psychology and 65 per cent with what approached physical and gen eral anthropology I found further that the publications in cluded in your index and hence those in which you are interested range from anatomy and histology of the nervous system to mathe matics on the one hand and metaphysics on the other covering practically the whole vast range of phenomena relating to the nervous system and mental activities of man and animals This shows indefiniteness incom plete crystallization As psychology advances its field will doubt less become better differentiated and possibly separated into a number of special sub branches When this happens the relations of the various subdivisions of psychology and those of anthropology will be more evident and easier of precision It will then be found that your anatomical and physiological sec tion will have many points of contact with physical anthropology while your sections on behavior beliefs habits dreams etc will con nect in many respects with the anthropolog ical studies which are today grouped under the terms of ethnology and ethnography However even such clarified relations would be of no great importance were it not for the fact that psychology must as time passes on enlarge the scope of its activities until no small part of these shall really become an thropological And here I must define anthropology Its old definition as the  science of man  is not sufficient being too comprehensive and too indefinite But if you will examine the activities in any branch of anthropology you will find that although they deal with a vast array of subjects they are all characterized by certain something distinctive and this is the comparative element Anthropology is essen tially a science of comparisons It is com parative human anatomy physiology psychol ogy sociology linguistics etc And being comparative it does not deal with individuals or mere abstract averages but with groups of mankind whether these are social occupa tional environmental racial or pathological In brief it is the science of human variation both in man himself and in his activities Let us now return to psychology In the course of its development psychology will unquestionably find its choicest field in group studies It has already begun in this direc tion It compares classes with classes as during the late war it will enter in the not far distant future into race psychology and it will compare other definite human groups with groups study their variations and the causes of these study evolution involution and degenerations of the nervous organs of mankind as a wholeand all this will be or be very near to anthropology A word in conclusion Anthropology and psychology as they are today are fairly inde pendent branches of scientific activities with no closer actual bonds and interdependence than those that exist for instance between either of them and sociology or history But in their further development and particularly that of psychology the two branches will ap proach closer together until an important part of their activities will be in the same orbit A IIRDLICKA

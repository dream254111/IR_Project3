latest version of Lake Glazier HENRY D HARROWER 753 Broadway New York Glaciers and glacialists Mr James D Dana in Science for Aug 20 says the memoirs of the Museum of comparative zoology founded by Mr Alexander Agassiz and not by his father In 1863 Prof Louis Agassiz got a first grant of ten thousand dollars from the legislature of Massachusetts for the publication of those memoirs The first paper is by Theodore Lyman and was issued in March 1865 The title is  Memoirs of the Museum of comparative zoology at Harvard college vol i Cambridge 186465 4 contents illustrated cata logue etc More than twelve volumes have been issued the first three during Louis Agassizs life As to the accusation of Mr Marcous charge against Mr Alexander Agassiz etc it is almost superfluousat least for those who have read my paper  to say that I have made no charge of any sort against Mr Alexander Agassiz and that his name is not even referred to JULES MARCOTU Cambridge Sept 11 The series was commenced as Illustrated cata logue and not as Memoirs each number independ ently paged these numbers were not collected into volumes until after Louis Agassizs death when the closing number 9 of the second volume published in 1876 was entitled  Memoirs and the titles to the first three volumes the third volume consisted of Nos 7 and 8 first printed and distributed ED Barometer exposure In accordance with  Gans  suggestion in Science viii p 255 I herewith present a copy of the baro graph record of Blue Hill observatory for the three hours from 9 AM to 12 M of Feb 27 1886 9A 10 11 12M 2879 286  285    The barograph from which this is taken is a Draper barograph and multiplies three times Its readings usually differ less than one onehundredth of an inch from the readings of an adjacent standard Hicks barometer with which its readings are compared every day The barograph is situated in the lower room of a twostory tower The air passes freely from this lower to an upper room through a register opening In the top of this upper room is a trap door opening out on the roof The roof is flat with a low turret around it and the trapdoor opens a little to the north of the centre A picture of the observatory will be found in Science v p 440 The wind movement during the three hours given on the diagram was 55 60 and 64 miles respectively as shown by a Draper anemograph The wind velocities were quite large all day of the 27th and rCE 325 the portion of the curve given in the above diagram is but a sample of the whole barograph curve of that date only the oscillations at an earlier hour when the windvelocity was greater are more rapid and slightly larger excepting the sharp depression at 1020 AM This portion of the curve was selected in order to exhibit this sharp depression which was coincident with the opening of the trapdoor in the tower The barograph was observed immediately before and immediately after the opening of the trap door The exact interval between opening the trap door and observing the barograph is not known but was probably less than a minute and I feel no doubt whatever of the coincidence of the fall of pressure with the opening of the trapdoor Several similar depressions though not so decided because the windvelocity was less were noted at a later date when one observer watched the barograph while another opened the trapdoor and the fall of pressure coincident with opening the door was un doubted The depression shown on the diagram at 1135 AM is found to be coincident with a marked increase in the winds velocity lasting several minutes followed by a more permanent increase after noon The following note was written on the barograph sheet of the 27th immediately after it was removed from the instrument  The sharp depression at 1020 AM was caused by opening hatch on tower the other sharp depressions correspond with severe gusts of wind On this date the upanddown oscillations of the mercury in the stand ard Hicks barometer were so rapid that it was almost impossible to set the vernier accurately Mr F V Pike informs me that he had the same difficulty in reading his standard barometer at Newburyport Mass Such oscillations of the baro graph as those on the diagram are quite common on Blue Hill They begin to be noted with windveloci ties of about thirty miles and increase in range with increased velocity of the wind though winds from certain directions seem to have more influence in pro ducing them than from other directions This is probably owing to the position of the apertures A rapid increase or decrease of the winds velocity as much as ten miles is I think always accompanied here by a corresponding decrease or increase of press ure which leads me to believe that even small wind velocities affect the barometer readings but the small oscillations spoken of above do not occur be cause the difference between the velocity of a gust and of a succeeding lull is not great enough to pro duce them I see no reasons for believing that the barometer is any more affecteJ by the wind here than elsewhere  Gans statement that he found small oscillations of the barograph with windvelocities of about twenty miles a similar statement by Mr E B Weston of Providence R I and the statement of Mr Pike that he had found rapid oscillations of his barometer during the high wind of Feb 27 con vince me that the effect of the wind on the barome ter is universal H HELM CLAYTON Blue Hill meteor observ Sept 23 These serrations furnished by Mr Clayton are certainly very extraordinary It will be noticed that the trapdoor is not upon a broad flat roof and also that there is only one of the effects which can be regarded as 05 below the general trend of the press ure trace It seems probable that the barometer suspended by long steel springs has a tendency to magnify the effect If it can be shown that the total326 SCIENCE effect here given is due to the actual formation of a partial vacuum produced by the wind blowing across the trapdoor and not to a fault in the barograph I will accept it Certainly any such effect as this could have been easily learned long ago by the watching of an ordinary barometer I have watched the ba rometer both mercurial and aneroid in very high winds and have never seen any thing at all like this effect GAN Oct 1 Constitution of the earth Reading yesterday the address of the president at the British association for the advancement of science at the recent meeting in Birmingham it seemed to me that in discussing the geology of the Atlantic and the constitution of the earth too much is ordi narily attributed to original action of sedimentary deposition  In the Scientific American of June 19 1885 is a section of the earth on a scale of five inches to its diameter Upon this in a greatly exaggerated verti cal scale are figured the heights of mountains and the depths of the ocean But in a smaller figure the author shows that the thin line used to describe the circumference would in its thickness alone include the whole of the departures of the mountainpeaks and deepest seas from the true circle or ellipse which should represent the outline of the globe If we sup pose a fiveinch globe of terracotta red and well burned clay to be dipped for a few moments into a muddy ditch when it comes out with a film of water adhering to its surface this thinnest film filled with animalcules adhering but so quickly evaporating will on this scale represent all the water contained in all the oceans and lakes and the small quantity which the slightly porous terracotta globe has ab sorbed will represent a greater quantity of water than all that is contained or ever has been contained in the depths and caverns and fissures of the earth itself The microscopic Desmidiaceae Pleurosigmae wrig gling vibriones and bacilli so well known to modern science and playing such important parts in life and death of man will swimming in the adherent film be greatly magnified representations of the huge monsters which crawled in the slime of morasses and swam in the oceans of primeval chaos when the earth first took form and ceased to be void The almost infinitesimal film of water will represent all the water that ever constituted a part of this world in which we live for science tells us that no violence has ever been able to project a stone beyond the sphere of the earths attraction and that no vapor of water no gas can float in the thin ether which sur rounds or penetrates our fifty miles of atmospheric depth What part then in the constitution and for mation and changes of the matter forming the depths of the earth can this very small proportion of waters sedimentary deposits play in the general construction of the globe  To us infinitesimal bodies the sur rounding rocks are immense Seen from the planet Mars in connection with the whole mass of the earth what are they  A skin an envelope thinner than the models adhering watery film Certainly we are more directly interested in the superficial strata which we can see and feel than in the deep masses of which we can learn so little that we speculate as to whether they are solid or fluid without reaching certainty But the depths in the general plan and VOL VIII No 192 constitution of matter far outweigh the surface for mations And fire for they are certainly hot has had much more to do in moulding the earth than water and its sediments M C MEIGS Washington DC Sept 25 The excessive voracity of the female Mantis A few days since I brought a male of Mantis carolina to a friend who had been keeping a solitary female as a pet Placing them in the same jar the male in alarm endeavored to escape In a few minutes the female succeeded in grasping him She first bit off his left front tarsus and consumed the tibia and femur Next she gnawed out his left eye At this the male seemed to realize his proximity to one of the opposite sex and began to make vain endeavors to mate The female next ate up his right front leg and then entirely decapitated him devouring his head and gnawing into his thorax Not until she had eaten all of his thorax except about three millimetres did she stop to rest All this while the male had con tinued his vain attempts to obtain entrance at the valvules and he now succeeded as she voluntarily spread the parts open and union took place She remained quiet for four hours and the remnant of the male gave occasional signs of life by a movement of one of his remaining tarsi for three hours The next morning she had entirely rid herself of her spouse and nothing but his wings remained The female was apparently fullfed when the male was placed with her and had always been plenti fully supplied with food The extraordinary vitality of the species which per mits a fragment of the male to perform the act of impregnation is necessary on account of the rapacity of the female and it seems to be only by accident that a male ever escapes alive from the embraces of his partner Westwood quotes from the Journal de physique 1784 an instance in which the female of the European species Mantis religiosa  decapitated the male before mating but I know of no record of a similar occurrence with M carolina nor of the further muti lation described above Riley in his First monthly report p 151 says The female being the strongest and most voracious the male in making his advances has to risk his life many times and only succeeds in grasping her by slyly and suddenly surprising her and even then he frequently gets remorselessly devoured In Packards  Guide p 575 we find  Professor Sanborn Tenney tells me he has observed the female after sexual union devour the male L 0 HOWARD Washington DC Sept 27 A mummified frog My letter which appeared in your issue of Sept 24 describing the specimen of a mummified Hyla con tained an error which I here wish to correct The frog was taken from the McLean county coalshaft of Illinois and not of Pennsylvania as stated and the newspaper account was published in Burlington Ill There is however a McLean county in Pennsylvania and it was through this fact that the slip in question occurred

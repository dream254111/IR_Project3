J101009,THE VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER,1099113,MASTERS LIABILITY A NEW DEPARTURE,I245881,6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER MASTBVIAS TTARTTTTYA NEW DEPARTURE FOLLOWING THE LEAD OF THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIANA IN MEADOR V R R CO 138 IND 290 WHICH CASE HAD IN TURN FOLLOWED THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW YORK IN MARSH V CHICKERING 101 NY 396 OUR SUPREME COURT IN THE RECENT CASE OF C  O R R CO V SPARROW 6 VA LAW REG 536 HAS INTRODUCED AN EXCEPTION TO THE LAW GOVERNING THE MASTERS LIABILITY FOR AN INJURY TO THE SERVANT OCCURRING FROM DEFECTIVE APPLIANCES WHICH WOULD SEEM NOT ONLY TO OPEN UP A FIELD FOR RENEWED CONFLICT AND CONFUSION BUT TO BE WRONG IN REASON RADICAL IN ITS TEN DENCIES AND SUBVERSIVE OF WHAT WE HAD HERETOFORE CONSIDERED THE ESTABLISHED DOCTRINE OF THIS STATE THIS EXCEPTION MAY BE THUS SUC CINCTLY YET FAIRLY STATED WHERE THE SERVANT IS EMPLOYED IN THE PER FORMANCE OF ORDINARY LABOR AND THE MATERIALS FURNISHED AND MACHINERY USED THEREIN ARE OF SUCH A NATURE AS NOT TO REQUIRE THE EXERCISE OF GREAT CARE AND SKILL IN THEIR USE THE MASTER IS NOT LIABLE TO THE SERVANT FOR AN INJURY OCCURRING TO HIM FROM THEIR DEFECTIVE CONDITION EVEN THOUGH THE SERVANT HAD NOTIFIED THE MASTER OF THIS DEFECTIVE CONDITION ASKED FOR A NEW IMPLEMENT AND THE MASTER HAD PROMISED TO FURNISH IT IT WILL BE SEEN THAT THIS NEW RULING BRINGS UP FOR DECISION PECULIAR AND IMPORTANT QUESTIONS WHICH MUST BE PRODUCTIVE OF ENDLESS CONTRA RIETY OF OPINION WHAT LABOR IS  ORDINARY  IN TWO OF THE CASES WE HAVE CITED THE SERVANT WAS ENGAGED IN LIGHTING LAMPS AT THE TIME HE WAS INJURED IN THE OTHER CASE HE WAS RUNNING A FERRY TO WHAT OTHER AVOCATIONS DOES THE TERM EXTEND PRINTING WEAVING PLANING SAWING THRESHING MOWING AND REAPING AND A HOST OF OTHER EMPLOY MENTS ARE CERTAINLY AS ORDINARY AS RUNNING A FERRY WHAT AMOUNTS TO THE EXERCISE OF  GREAT CARE AND SKILL  WHAT ARE THOSE APPLIANCES WHICH DO NOT REQUIRE THE EXERCISE OF  GREAT CARE AND SKILL  THESE AND OTHER QUESTIONS WILL ARISE TO VEX AND OVERWHELM WITH A SEA OF TROUBLE BUT THIS IS THE LEAST OF THE GRIEVOUS EFFECTS OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SUCH AN EXCEPTION ITS RADICAL TENDENCIES ARE FAR WORSE THAN THE QUES TIONS IT RAISES FOR DECISION WE UNDERSTAND THE REASONING BY WHICH THE COURT REACHED ITS CONCLUSION TO BE THAT THE LIABILITY OF THE MASTER FOR AN INJURY TO THE SERVANT OCCURRING FROM DEFECTIVE MACHINERY IS FOUNDED UPON THE MASTERS PRESUMED SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE AS TO THE MACHINERY AND THAT WHEN THE COURT CAN SAY FROM THE SIMPLICITY OF THE MACHINERY AND THE ORDINARY CHARACTER OF THE LABOR THAT THE SERVANT MUST HAVE A 732 MARCH1901 MASTERS LIABILITYA NEW DEPARTURE 733 KNOWLEDGE OF THE PARTICULAR APPLIANCES EQUAL OR SUPERIOR TO THE MASTER THE MASTER IS ABSOLVED FROM HIS LIABILITY THE FOUNDATION FOR IT HAVING BEEN REMOVED WE HAD SUPPOSED THAT THE NUCKOLS CASE 91 VA 193 SET TLED THE LAW AS TO FELLOWSERVANTS BY MAKING THE TEST THE NATURE OF THE DUTY THE SERVANT WHO CAUSED THE INJURY WAS PERFORMING AT THAT TIME AND THAT AMONG THE SOCALLED NONASSIGNABLE DUTIES WERE THOSE OF FURNISHING PROPER AND ADEQUATE APPLIANCES A SAFE PLACE IN WHICH TO WORK KEEPING THEM SO BY SUITABLE INSPECTION AND THE PROMULGATION OF NECESSARY RULES REGULATIONS AND INFORMATION WE HAD SUPPOSED THAT THE AMPEY CASE 93 VA 108 SETTLED THE LAW AS TO ASSUMED RISKS TO BE THAT IF IT IS REASONABLY PROBABLE THAT THE DANGER CAN BE AVOIDED BY THE EXERCISE OF GREATER CARE AND SKILL THE MASTER IS LIABLE PROVIDED HE WAS NOTIFIED OF THE DEFECT AND THE SERVANT EXERCISED THE GREATER CARE AND SKILL THE LOGICAL CONSEQUENCE OF THE COURSE OF REASONING IN THE SPAR ROW CASE WILL OVERTURN BOTH OF THESE DECISIONS IF THE LIABILITY OF THE MASTER FOR INJURIES RESULTING TO THE SERVANT FROM USING DEFECTIVE MA CHINERY BE FOUNDED UPON THE MASTERS ASSUMED SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE AND THIS PRESUMPTION WILL YIELD TO A CONSTRUCTIVE KNOWLEDGE IMPUTED BY THE COURT TO THE SERVANT IN THE CASE OF ORDINARY LABOR WITH SIMPLE MA CHINERY IT MUST ALSO YIELD TO THE ACTUAL SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE OF THE SERVANT IN ANY CASE EVEN OF COMPLICATED MACHINERY IN A DANGEROUS SERVICE THIS IS A HIGHLY PROBABLE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DOCTRINE OF THE SPARROW CASE WHEN WE CONSIDER THE RECENT AND IMPORTANT GROWTH OF THE LAW AS TO FELLOWSERVANTS AND ASSUMED RISKS AND ONE STRICTLY CONSONANT WITH THE LINE OF REASONING UPON WHICH THE DECISION IN THE SPARROW CASE IS BASED NOW AS A MATTER OF FACT THE MASTER EMPLOYS THE SERVANT ONLY AND SOLELY BECAUSE THE SERVANT HOLDS HIMSELF OUT AS BEING SKILLED IN THE USE OF THIS PARTICULAR MACHINERY IN THIS LINE OF LABOR AND BEING IN DAILY CONTACT WITH IT THE SERVANT IS THE FIRST ONE WHO WOULD NOTICE A DEFECT HENCE THE SERVANT IS MOST GENERALLY POSSESSED OF AN ACTUALLY SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE AS TO BOTH LABOR AND MACHINERY AND THE MASTER OULD WITH ALL PROPRIETY CONTEND THAT SINCE THE ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE SERVANT WAS SUPERIOR THE MASTER IS NOT LIABLE THIS WOULD AT ONCE ABSOLVE THE MASTER FROM THE DUTY OF FURNISHING PROPER MACHINERY A SAFE PLACE IN WHICH TO WORK THE PUBLICATION OF RULES AND INFORMATION AND THE MAKING OF SUITABLE INSPECTION AND ALL RISKS WHETHER ORDINARY OR EXTRAOR DINARY OPEN AND OBVIOUS OR CONCEALED WOULD BE ASSUMED BY THE SERVANT NOR DOES THE FACT THAT THE SERVANT NOTIFIED THE MASTER OF THE DEFECT AND THE MASTER PROMISED TO REPAIR IT ALTER THE CASE IN THE SLIGHTEST SAYS THE COURT IN THE SPARROW CASE6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER  THE FACT THAT HE NOTIFIED THE MASTER OF THE DEFECT AND ASKED FOR ANOTHER IM PLEMENT AND THE MASTER PROMISED TO FURNISH IT IN SUCH A CASE DOES NOT RENDER THE MASTER RESPONSIBLE IF AN ACCIDENT OCCURRED IF THIS APPLIES WHERE THE IMPUTED KNOWLEDGE OF THE SERVANT IS EQUAL OR SUPERIOR TO THE ASSUMED KNOWLEDGE OF THE MASTER IT MUST APPLY WHERE THE ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE SERVANT IS EQUAT OR SUPERIOR TO THAT OF THE MASTER WHICH IS NOW ALWAYS THE CASE AND THUS ANOTHER HITHERTO WELL RECOGNIZED RULE OF LAW IS SWEPT AWAY WE THINK WE ARE RIGHT WHEN WE AFFIRM THAT A DOCTRINE SO RADICAL IN ITS TENDENCIES AND SUBVERSIVE OF DECIDED CASES MUST BE AND IS WRONG IN REASON IN THE FIRST PLACE IT TOTALLY DISREGARDS AND MAKES OF NO EFFECT THE EXPRESS PROMISE OF THE MASTER ON THE FAITH OF WHICH THE SER VANT HAS RELIED IN THE SECOND PLACE IT PUTS THE SERVANT WHO IS USING COMPLICATED MACHINERY IN A DANGEROUS SERVICE IN A BETTER POSITION THAN THE SERVANT WHO IS USING SIMPLE MACHINERY IN AN ORDINARY SERVICE SAYS THE COURT IN THE SPARROW CASE IN CASES IN WHICH PERSONS ARE ENGAGED IN A DANGEROUS SERVICE IT HAS BEEN MANY TIMES HELD THAT IF THE MACHINERY WAS DEFECTIVE AND THE PLAINTIFF HAD KNOW LEDGE OF IT AND MADE OBJECTION THERETO AND WAS INJURED BY REASON OF SUCH DEFECT AND HE DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE INJURY BY HIS OWN FAULT OR NEGLIGENCE HE WILL BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER BUT IN SUCH CASE GREATER CARE WILL BE REQUIRED OF HIM THAN IF HE HAD KNOWN OF THE DEFECT THE AMPEY CASE 93 VA 108 MADE THE TEST OF RECOVERY WHETHER IT WAS REASONABLY PROBABLE THAT THE DANGER COULD BE AVOIDED BY THE EXER CISE OF GREATER CARE AND SKILL IF THIS BE SO IS IT NOT MORE REASONABLY PROBABLE THAT A SERVANT COULD AVOID DANGER IN THE USE OF SIMPLE APPLI ANCES IN ORDINARY LABOR THAN IN THE USE OF COMPLICATED MACHINERY IN A DANGEROUS SERVICE WOULD THE SERVANT NOT BE LESS PRUDENT AND LESS ENTITLED TO RECOVER WHEN HE CONTINUED TO WORK IN A DANGEROUS SERVICE WITH COMPLICATED MACHINERY WHICH HE KNEW TO BE DEFECTIVE THAN WHEN HE CONTINUED TO WORK IN ORDINARY LABOR WITH SIMPLE APPLIANCES WHICH HE KNEW TO BE DEFECTIVE  WHY SUCH A DISCRIMINATION AS THE COURT HAS MADE IN THE THIRD PLACE THE COURT HAS UNDERTAKEN TO ESTABLISH AS A MATTER OF LAW IRRESPECTIVE OF THE FACTS OF THE CASE A CONSTRUCTIVE AND AN ASSUMED KNOWLEDGE TO GIVE THIS ASSUMED AND CONSTRUCTIVE KNOWLEDGE EACH A VALUE OF ITS OWN AND BY A COMPARISON OF THESE VALUES TO DECIDE THE CASE IN THE FOURTH PLACE WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHOSE KNOWLEDGE IS TO BE TAKEN AS THE CRITERION WHERE A CORPORATION IS THE MASTER IN ORDER FOR THE COURT TO BE ABLE TO SAY AS TO ITS EQUALITY WITH OR SUPERIORITY TO THAT OF THE SERVANT IT CANNOT BE THE BOSS OR SUPERINTENDENT CONDUCTOR OR SECTIONMASTER FOR THE DOCTRINE THAT SUCH 734 MARCH1901 MASTERS LIABILITYA NEW DEPARTURE A SUPERIOR IN GRADE IS VICEPRINCIPAL BECAUSE OF SUCH SUPERIORITY HAS BEEN ABOLISHED IS IT THE PRESIDENT VICEPRESIDENT SECRETARY DIRECTOR OR STOCKHOLDER  IN THE SPARROW CASE WHAT OFFICER WAS IT OF THE C  O R R CO TO WHOSE ASSUMED KNOWLEDGE THE COURT HELD THE IMPUTED KNOWLEDGE OF SPARROW EQUAL OR SUPERIOR  IN A NOTE IN 40 L R A AT PAGE 798 THE EDITOR HAS STATED SOME OF THESE OBJECTIONS VERY FORCIBLY AS FOLLOWS IT IS SUBMITTED THAT 4MARSH V CHICKERING 1886 101 N Y 396 AND THE DECISIONS WHICH HAVE FOLLOWED IT DO NOT REST UPON ANY RATIONAL BASIS THE MODI FICATION OF THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE INTRODUCED BY THEM CAN BE SUPPORTED ONLY UPON THE HYPOTHESIS THAT ONE OR OTHER OF THESE THEORIES IS CORRECT 1 THAT IN THE CASE OF SIMPLE APPLIANCES THE PROMISE OF THE MASTER DOES NOT IN ANY WAY ALTER OR SHIFT HIS RESPONSIBILITY EVEN TEMPORARILY 2 THAT THE QUANTITATIVE VALUE OF THE CONSTRUCTIVE KNOWLEDGE IMPUTED TO THE SERVANT WITH REGARD TO THE DEFECTS IN SUCH APPLIANCE IS DIFFERENT FROM THE QUANTITATIVE VALUE OF SUCH ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE AS HE MAY ACQUIRE IN REGARD TO MORE ELABORATE INSTRUMENTALITIES 3 THAT THE DANGER OF HANDLING SIMPLE APPLIANCES LIKE LADDERS SPADES AXES ETC IS AS A MATTER OF LAW SO SERIOUS AS TO REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF THE RULE THAT THE MASTERS PROMISE WILL NOT WARRANT A CONTINUANCE OF THE SERVICE WHERE THE HAZARDS TO WHICH THE SERVANT WILL BE EXPOSED ARE SO IMMINENT THAT NO PRUDENT MAN WOULD ENCOUNTER THEM ALL THESE POSITIONS ARE MANIFESTLY UNTENABLE THE FIRST BECAUSE IT ENTAILS THE ANOMALY OF GAUGING THE EFFECT OF AN EXPRESS STIPULATION BY THE NATURE OF THE SUBJECT MATTER TO WHICH IT RELATES THE SECOND BECAUSE IT INVOLVES A LOGICAL ABSURDITY THE THIRD BECAUSE IT IGNORES A MOST OBVIOUS FACT THE TRUTH OF THE WHOLE SITUATION IS THAT THE QUANDARY HAS ARISEN BE CAUSE A WRONG REASON HAS BEEN GIVEN FOR THE MASTERS RESPONSIBILITY IN SUCH CASES HE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE BECAUSE OF ANY ASSUMED SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE HIS RESPONSIBILITY IS AN ATTRIBUTE OF HIS OWNERSHIP BE CAUSE HE IS THE ONE IN AUTHORITY AND HAS THE COMPLETE CONTROLLING POWER HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROPER EXERCISE OF THAT POWER TO THIS ACCOUNTABILITY HE SHOULD BE HELD AND HIS PROMISE SHOULD PROTECT THE SERVANT IN ALL CASES UNLESS THE DANGER IS SO IMMINENT THAT NO PRUDENT MAN WOULD ENCOUNTER IT AS ONLY THREE JUDGES SAT IN THE CASE AND THERE WAS ANOTHER GROUND UPON WHICH THE DECISION WAS RESTED IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT A FULL BENCH WILL RECONSIDER THE QUESTION AND THAT MEANWHILE IT WILL NOT BE TREATED AS CLOSED IN THE LOWER COURTS THE DECISION IN THE SPARROW CASE WOULD SEEM TO BE AUTHORITY FOR ANOTHER PROPOSITION NOT CONNECTED WITH THE DOCTRINE DISCUSSED ABOVE AND WHICH DOES NOT APPEAR FROM THE REPORT OF THE CASENAMELY THAT A PLAINTIFF IN ERROR IS NOT PRECLUDED IN THE APPELLATE COURT BY ANY 7356 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER ADMISSION OF FACT HOWEVER CLEAR AND DISTINCT IN HIS PETITION FOR WRIT OF ERROR BUT MAY AT THE HEARING TAKE WITH REFERENCE TO THE FACTS OR EVIDENCE A POSITION DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED TO THAT RELIED ON IN HIS PETITION IT WILL APPEAR THAT THE REVERSAL OF THE DECISION OF THE CIRCUIT COURT WAS RESTED IN PART ON THE FACT AS FOUND BY THE APPELLATE COURT OF CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE UPON THE PART OF SPARROW IN USING AN OBVIOUSLY DEFECTIVE AND DANGEROUS ROPE IN THE PETITION FOR WRIT OF ERROR HOW EVER THIS INFERENCE FROM THE EVIDENCE WAS DISTINCTLY WAIVED BY THE RAILROAD COMPANY AS THE FOLLOWING QUOTATION FROM THE PETITION WILL SHOW THE ROPE APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT FRAYED BUT NOT ENOUGH TO EXCITE ANY APPREHENSION AS TO ITS STRENGTH EITHER IN THE MIND OF SPARROW OR OF ANY ONE ELSE OF THE MANY PERSONS WHO USED THE FERRY SPARROW DECLARED WITHIN A MONTH BEFORE THE ACCIDENT THAT IT WOULD PULL A RAILROAD ENGINE AND WAS SAFE THE ONLY WITNESS WHO DIFFERS FROM THIS VIEW WAS INTRODUCED BY THE PLAINTIFF HE SAID IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPRUDENT FOR A MAN LIKE JIM SPARROW IN A BOAT TO RELY UPON THAT ROPE TO GET IT BEHIND THAT CRIB IT WAS SPARROWS DUTY TO INSPECT THE ROPE AND TO REPORT IF IT WAS NOT IN GOOD CONDITION THERE IS NO PROOF THAT HE DID SO NOR CAN THE DEFENDANT CLAIM THAT THE PLAINTIFFS WITNESS WAS CORRECT WHEN HE SAID THAT SPARROW WAS IMPRUDENT IN RELYING ON THE ROPE IT WOULD LIKE TO DO SO BUT THE EVIDENCE IS TOO CONCLUSIVE AS TO THE STRENQTH OF THAT ROPE TO JUSTIFY ANY SUCH ARGUMENT THE FOREGOING DEDUCTION FROM THE OPINION IS IRRESISTIBLE AND IT IS THE MORE STRIKING IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE OPINION CONCEDES THE RULE THAT WHERE THE EVIDENCE LEAVES THE CONTROVERSY EVEN IN SUCH A STATE OF UNCERTAINTY THAT REASONABLE MEN MIGHT DIFFER CONCERNING THE MATERIAL FACTS AND THE PROPER INFERENCES TO BE DEDUCTED THEREFROM THE DEMURRER TO THE EVIDENCE SHOULD BE OVERRULED INDEED IT IS STATED THAT THE RULE WAS STRICTLY OBSERVED THE DEDUCTION IS STRIKING HERE BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THE JUDGE OF THE TRIAL COURT AND THE COUNSEL FOR THE RAILROAD COMPANY WHO OBTAINED THE WRIT OF ERROR CONCURRED IN THE VIEW THAT CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE WAS NOT DEDUCIBLE FROM THE EVIDENCE THE SUPREME COURT THREE JUDGES SIT TING ON A DEMURRER TO THE EVIDENCE HELD THAT SUCH NEGLIGENCE WAS SO PLAINLY SHOWN THAT REASONABLE MEN COULD NOT DIFFER IN RESPECT TO IT QUERY WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE RESULT IF THE SUPREME COURT HAD STOOD THREE TO TWO ON THE QUESTION WHETHER CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE EVIDENCE THE MAJORITY HOLDING THAT IT WAS IT IS PROPER TO STATE THAT THE COUNSEL WHO REPRESENTED THE RAILROAD IN THE SUPREME COURT WERE NOT THE SAME AS THOSE WHO DID IN THE TRIAL MARCH 7361901 MASTERS LIABILITYA NEW DEPARTURE 737 COURT AND PREPARED THE PETITION FOR THE WRIT OF ERROR AND THAT IN THE CLOSING BRIEF AND ORAL ARGUMENT THE CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE OF SPARROW WAS MAINLY RELIED ON IN THE MORE RECENT CASE OF C  0 R B CO V RISON 2 VA SUP CT REP AT PAGE 655 PHLEGAR J DELIVERING THE OPINION OF THE FULL COURT SAYS A PARTY IS FORBIDDEN TO ASSUME SUCCESSIVE POSITIONS IN THE COURSE OF A SUIT OR SERIES OF SUITS IN RESPONSE TO THE SAME FACT OR STATE OF FACTS WHICH ARE INCONSISTENT WITH EACH OTHER AND MUTUALLY CONTRADICTORY TO WHAT EXTENT DOES THIS LANGUAGE DISCREDIT THE FOREGOING DEDUCTION FROM THE SPARROW CASE F W R PERKINS

THIS IS IN MY OPINION THE GREATEST PROBLEM OF THE FUTURE FOR OUR LAW I INVITE ATTENTION TO MY GENERAL THEME BY MAK ING TWO ASSERTIONS FIRST A MOST IMPORTANT PROCESS OF THE NEXT TWENTYFIVE YEARS IN THE WORLDS AFFAIRS WILL BE A VAST ACTIVITY IN WORLDLEGISLATION SECONDLY INTO THIS ACTIVITY THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WILL ENTER AS A SELFINFLICTED CRIPPLE UNLESS CERTAIN POSITIVE MEASURES ARE FIRST TAKEN TO REMOVE THIS DISABILITY I SPEAK OF AN ACTUAL SITUATIONACTUAL BOTH IN ITS FACTS AND IN ITS LAW I DO NOT MERELY WARN OF A POSSIBLE DANGER AND ADVISE A POSSIBLE REMEDY BUT I SPEAK OF INDISPUTABLE REALITIES AND OF AN INDISPENSABLE REMEDY INTRODUCTORY LET US FIRST NOTICE THE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION IN A PRELIMINARY SURVEY BEFORE EXAMINING THE NECESSARY REMEDY AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THAT REMEDY IS NOW BEING CANVASSED LET US ASK EDITORIAL NOT THIS IS THE LAST OF A SERIES OF THREE LECTURES DELIVERED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA BY DEAN WIGMORE ON THE BARBOURPAGE FOUNDATION THE SUBJECT OF THE FIRST LECTURE WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN THE JANUARY 1917 ISSUE OF THE VIRGINIA LAW REVIXW P 247 WAS THE PAST PROBLEMS OF THE LAWS EVOLUTION THE TITLE OF THE SECOND LEC TURE WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN THE FEBRUARY 1917 ISSUE OF THE VIRGINIA LAW RVIXW P 337 WAS THE PRESENT PROBLEMS OF THE LAWS MECHAN ISM IN AMERICA THE TITLE OF THE THIRD LECTURE WHICH IS PRINTED ABOVE WAS THE FUTURE PROBLEMS OF WORLDLEGISLATION AND AMERICAS SHARE THEREIN THESE LECTURES WILL BE PUBLISHED IN BOOK FORM BY THE BAR BOURPAGE FOUNDATIONVIRGINIA LAW REVIEW 1 WHAT IS MEANT BY THIS WORLDLEGISLATION 2 IS WORLD LEGISLATIONTHAT IS LEGISLATION FOR THE UNIFORMITY OR IDENTITY OR ASSIMILATION OF THE SEVERAL NATIONAL LAWSIS IT DESIRABLE DESIRABLE FOR ANYBODY AND DESIRABLE FOR US 3 HOW FAR HAS SUCH WORLDLEGISLATION ACTUALLY PROCEEDED AT THE PRESENT DATE 4 WHAT ARE THE VARIOUS METHODS BY WHICH WORLDLEGISLATION HAS HITHERTO BEEN EFFECTED AND THIS WILL BRING US TO THE MAIN IN QUIRY VIZ BY WHAT METHODS CAN THE UNITED STATES TAKE PART IN WORLDLEGISLATION  I WHAT IS MEANT BY WORLDLEGISLATION I DO NOT REFER TO THE FIELD OF PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW I E THE LEGAL RELATIONS OF STATES WITH EACL OTHER WHETHER IN WAR OR IN PEACE PUBLIC INTER NATIONAL LAW OF COURSE IS DUE TO RECEIVE SOME SORT OF MORE RIGID SANCTION IN THE FUTURE BY A WORLDPARLIAMENT OR LEAGUE BUT THAT IS RATHER WORLDPOLITICS THAN WORLDLAW IN THE STRICT SENSE SUCH A LEAGUE WOULD BE CONCERNED ONLY WITH THE RIGHTS OF ONE STATE OR GOVERNMENT AGAINST ANOTHER WHAT I PROPOSE TO DIS CUSS IS THE INTERNATIONAL ASPECT OF THE SUBSTANTIVE NATIONAL LAW AFFECTING THE RELATIONS BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS OF DIFFERENT STATES THE LAW OF CONTRACTS PROPERTY AND COMMERCE GENERALLYPRIVATE LAW SOCALLEDIN SHORT LAW OF THE KIND THAT THE PRACTICING LAW YER ORDINARILY USES IN THE AFFAIRS OF CLIENTS THE KIND THAT CONSTI TUTES 99 OF THE LAW OF DAILY LIFE FOR ALL OF US THAT BODY OF LAW AS WE SEE IT NOW CONSISTS OF THE LAW MADE BY ILLINOIS OR BY VIRGINIA FOR ITS OWN INHABITANTS I E THE LAW OF THE SEVERAL AMERICAN STATES AND THE FEDERAL LAW FOR INTERSTATE AND NATIONAL CAUSES TO THIS CORRESPONDS THE NATIONAL AND LOCAL LAW OF ENG LAND OF FRANCE OF GERMANY OF LATINAMERICA AND OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES NOW THE CITIZENS OF THESE VARIOUS COUNTRIES HAVE ALWAYS HAD INTERSTATE TRANSACTIONS WITH EACH OTHER BUT IN THE LAST GEN ERATION OR TWO WITH THE ENORMOUS EXPANSION OF RAPID COMMUNI CATION BY STEAM AND ELECTRICITY BY MAIL CABLE AND WIRELESS INTER NATIONAL INTERCOURSE HAS INCREASED BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS THE DIVERSITY OF NATIONAL LAWS HAS THUS BECOME MORE OBVIOUS AND MORE INCONVENIENT EVERY SHIPMENT OF WHEAT OUTSIDE OF THE BOUNDARIES OF THIS COUNTRY RAISES QUESTIONS OF THE LAW OF TWO OR MORE COUNTRIES EVERY AMERICAN CORPORATION STARTING TRADE IN 424PROBLEMS OF WORLDLEGISLATION LATINAMERICA FINDS THAT TWO OR MORE DIVERSE SYSTEMS OF LAW AFFECT ITS BUSINESS THE DIVERSITY OF LAWS IS A DAILY WORLDPHE NOMENON SENSED IN ALMOST EVERY LARGE COUNTINGHOUSE IN EVERY COUNTRY THE QUESTION OF REMOVING THAT DIVERSITY OF LAW AND OF EFFECTING UNIFORMITY OR ASSIMILATION OF LAW HAS THUS ARISEN IN RECENT YEARS IT HAS COME TO THE FRONT IN ALL CIRCLES OF THE COM MERCIAL WORLD THE DIPLOMATIC WORLD AND THE JUDICIAL WORLD THE QUESTION THEN IS PRESENTED SHALL WE ENDEAVOR TO MAKE UNIFORM THE LAWS OF THE SEVERAL COUNTRIES BY ASSIMILATING THEM TO ONE ANOTHER  2 IS UNIFORMITY OR ASSIMILATION OF THE SEVERAL NATIONAL LAWS OF THE WORLD DESIRABLE IN ALL THAT HAS BEEN SAID AND DONE ON THIS SUBJECT DURING THREE GENERATIONS PAST TWO DIFFERENT ATTITUDES MAY BE PERCEIVED THE IDEAL AND THE PRACTICAL THE MOVEMENT STARTED WITH IDEALISTS BACK IN THE DAYS OF THE FIRST WORLDEXPOSITIONS IN THE 1850S AT LONDON AND AT PARIS MANY GREAT LEADERS IN LAW POLITICS AND COMMERCE PROPOSED UNI FORMITY OF LAW AS AN END IN ITSELF AS AN IDEAL WORTH REACHING FOR ITS OWN SAKE THE FRIENDSHIP OF NATIONS THE UNITY OF ACTION AND PROGRESS WAS THE INSPIRING THEME BUT THIS POINT OF VIEW HAS BEEN LONG ABANDONED BY ALL BUT A FEW THE ATTITUDE NOW PERCEIVABLE AND THE ONLY PRACTICAL ONE IS THAT UNIFORMITY IS DESIRABLE SO FAR AS IT SERVES A PRACTICAL NEED AND NO FURTHER AND THIS IS THE SOUND VIEW UNIFORMITY AS AN END IN ITSELF IS NOT DESIRABLE VARIETY IS DESIRABLE BECAUSE VA RIETY MEANS INDIVIDUALITY AND INDIVIDUAL LIFE IS THE ONLY ENDUR ABLE LIFETHE ONLY LIFE OF LIBERTY WE ARE AT PRESENT WITNESSING THE DIREFUL RESULTS OF AN IDEAL OF COMPULSORY UNIFORMITYTHE IDEAL OF THE PRUSSIAN STATE WHICH INSISTS THAT ALL INDIVIDUALS SHALL SURRENDER THEIR LIBERTY OF HABITS TO THE UNIFORM DICTATION OF THE 1 SOME ACCOUNT OF THESE EARLIER IDEALS MAY BE FOUND IN PROFESSOR COHNS CHAPTER ON THE HISTORY OF THE UNIFORMITY OF COMMERCIAL LAW IN PROGRESS OF CONTINENTAL LAW IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY BOSTON 1917 CONTINENTAL LEGAL HISTORY SERIES VOL XI AT THE PRESENT DAY THE ONLY ADVOCATE OF UNIFORMITY FOR ITS OWN SAKE APPEARS TO BE PROFESSOR IVAN PERICH OF BELGRADE IN HIS ADDRESS DELIVERED AT THE FIRST CONGRESS OF THE EUROPEAN FEDERATION AT ROME IN 1909 ROMA FORZANI WHICH IS ENTITLED INFLUENCE DE LUNITE DE LA LEGISLATION CIVILE SUR LE DEVOL OPPEMENT DE LA SOLIDARITE PARMI LES NATIONS 425VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW STATE THE WORLD AT LARGE COULD NEVER ENDURE SUCH UNIFORMITY WE DO NOT WANT TO PRUSSIANIZE THE WORLD WHETHER WITH FRENCH OR GERMAN OR ANGLOAMERICAN OR ANY OTHER LAW THE RICHNESS AND FULLNESS OF LIFE IN NATIONAL HABITS AS IN PERSONAL HABITS WILL BE ANNIHILATED IF INDIVIDUALITY IS SUPPRESSED LIVE AND LET LIVE IS HERE THE ONLY TRUTH UNIFORMITY OF LAW THEN AS AN END IN ITSELF IS NOT ONLY AN IMPOSSIBLE DREAM IT WOULD BE A NIGHTMARE BUT ON THE OTHER HAND FROM THE PRACTICAL POINT OF VIEW UNI FORMITY IS DESIRABLE IN SO FAR AS IT SERVES TO REMOVE SOME EVIL OR SOME INCONVENIENCE ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED WHICH ARISES FROM THE DIVERSITY OF LAWS IF THAT IS THE BASIS OF THE DEMAND FOR UNI FORMITY BY ALL MEANS LET US STRIVE FOR IT FOR THEN IT IS NOT ONLY DESIRABLE IT IS NECESSARY AND SUCH IS TODAY THE SPIRIT IN WHICH UNIFORMITY IS BEING SOUGHT ALL THE PUBLICISTS AND JURISTS TODAY AGREE IN THIS ATTITUDE2 THERE HAVE BEEN AND ARE NUMEROUS WAYS IN WHICH WORLD INTER COURSE HAS BEEN SERIOUSLY OBSTRUCTED BY DIVERSITY OF LAWS AND IN MANY PARTS OF LAW UNIFORMITY HAS ALREADY BECOME A NATURAL AND SUCCESSFUL MEANS OF REMOVING THESE OBSTRUCTIONS LET US NOW BRIEFLY REVIEW SOME OF THE ACHIEVEMENTS THIS REPRESENTS THE THIRD STAGE OF MY PRELIMINARY EXPLANATION 3 HOW FAR HAS WORLDLEGISLATION ACTUALLY PROGRESSED3 1 THE LAWS OF RAILWAY FREIGHT TRAFFIC HAVE BEEN MADE UNIFORM FOR EUROPE BY AN ORGANIZATION PERFECTED IN 1893 ALL THE MATTERS OF LAW THAT WOULD BE COVERED BY A BILL OF LADING ARE GOVERNED BY THIS UNION WHICH HAS ITS HEADQUARTERS IN SWITZERLAND 2 THE MARITIME LAW OF GENERAL AVERAGEI E THE SHARES OF CON TRIBUTION PAYABLE BY SHIPPER AND SHIPOWNER AND INSURERS FOR SEALOSSES INCURREDHAS BEEN MADE UNIFORM BY A VOLUNTARY BUT UNIVERSAL CONTRACT SYSTEM 3 THE MARITIME LAW OF COLLISIONS HAS BEEN MADE UNIFORM IN LARGE PART BY THE RULES OF NAVIGA TION AT SEA NOW ENFORCED BY UNIFORM NATIONAL LEGISLATION IN  SOME OF THE IMPORTANT UTTERANCES ON THIS SUBJECT BY NIPPOLD OF SWITZERLAND RIPERT OF FRANCE PICARD OF BELGIUM BALDWIN OF CON NECTICUT AND OTHERS WILL BE FOUND COLLECTED IN PART III OF PROGRESS OF CONTINENTAL LAW IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY BOSTON 1917 CONTI NENTAL LEGAL HISTORY SERIES VOL XI THE HISTORY HERE SUMMARIZED IS GIVEN IN FULL DETAIL BY REINSCH COHN AND OTHERS IN THE VOLUME ABOVE CITED 426PROBLEMS OF WORLDLEGISLATION MORE THAN THIRTY COUNTRIES 4 THE COMMERCIAL LAW OF BILLS OF EXCHANGE HAS BEEN BROUGHT INTO TENTATIVE UNIFORMITY FOR THE EU ROPEAN CONTINENT BY CONFERENCES BEGINNING SOME FORTY YEARS AGO THE DRAFT ADOPTED BY THE LAST ONE IN 1912 HAS NOW BECOME LAW IN MOST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES IN CHINA AND JAPAN AND IN SOME LATINAMERICAN COUNTRIES 5 THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW OF COMMUNICATIONS BY MAIL BY WIRE TELEGRAPH BY MARINE CABLE AND BY WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY HAS BEEN MADE UNIFORM THE CENTRAL BUREAU OF EACH UNION IS IN SWITZERLAND THE WIRELESS UNION IS NOT YET PERFECTED 6 THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW OF AUTOMOBILE TRAFFIC HAS BEEN MADE UNIFORM BY AN OFFICIAL CONFERENCE ON THE EUROPEAN CONTINENT 7 THE LAW OF INTELLECTUAL AND INDUSTRIAL PROPERTYPATENTS TRADEMARKS AND COPYRIGHTSHAS BEEN MADE UNIFORM IN ITS INTERNATIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE FEATURES BY A UNION HAVING HEADQUARTERS IN SWITZERLAND 8 THE LAW OF INDUSTRIAL PROTECTION FOR LABORERS BY MEASURES OF SAFETY TO HEALTH AND LIFE IS IN COURSE OF SLOWLY BEING MADE UNIFORM THROUGH CONVENTIONS THUS FAR THE PROHIBITION OF WHITE PHOSPHORUS IS THE PRINCIPAL MEASURE AGREED ON ANOTHER PROPOSED FIELD IS INDUSTRIAL INSURANCE 9 THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW OF AGRICULTURE IN RESPECT TO LOCAL FAVORS OR RESTRICTIONS AND EXCHANGE OF PRIVILEGES IS IN THE PRO CESS OF SLOW ASSIMILATION THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE INSTITUTE IS IN ITALY BUT DAVID LUBIN AN AMERICAN FOUNDED IT 10 THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW OF SANITATION IS BEING HARMONIZED BY SUC CESSIVE CONFERENCES AND UNIONSAFFECTING CONTAGIOUS DISEASES DELETERIOUS IMPORTS SUCH AS OPIUM AND THE LIKE 11 CRIMINAL POLICE MEASURES HAVE BEEN IN A FEW SUBJECTS MADE UNIFORM THE PROTECTION OF FISHERIES AND OF SUBMARINE CABLES THE SUPPRES SION OF THE NEGRO SLAVE TRADE OF THE LIQUOR TRAFFIC AND OF THE PROSTITUTE TRADE AND THE ADOPTION OF CRIMINAL IDENTIFICATION SYS TEMS 12 THE LAW OF PERSONAL STATUS BY MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE HAS BEEN IN PART MADE UNIFORM ON THE CONTINENT AND IN LATIN AMERICA BY CONVENTIONS PROVIDING RULES TO SOLVE CONFLICTS OF LAW 13 THE LAW OF EXECUTION OF JUDGMENTS HAS SIMILARLY BEEN MADE UNIFORM ON THE CONTINENT AND IN LATINAMERICA BY CONVENTIONS FOR SOLVING CONFLICTS OF LAW IN THE RULES OF BANK RUPTCY AND OF EXECUTION OF JUDGMENTS THESE ARE THE PRINCIPAL FIELDS IN WHICH COMPLETE OR PARTIAL RE 427VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW SUITS HAVE ALREADY BEEN ACHIEVED I NOW PROCEED TO THE FOURTH AND LAST PRELIMINARY POINT OF EXPLANATION VIZ 4 BY WHAT METHODS JZAS THIS UNIFORMITY OF LAW BEEN ATTAINED FOUR METHODS IN ALL ARE AVAILABLE AND HAVE BEEN USED A UNI FORM USAGE OF PARTIES OR GROUPS BY VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT B UNIFORM NATIONAL LAW BY VOLUNTARY NATIONAL LEGISLATION C UNIFORM INTERNATIONAL ADMINISTRATION BY EXECUTIVE ORDER D UNIFORM RULES FOR DECIDING CONFLICTS OF LAW A UNIFORM ULSAGE THE MOST NOTABLE EXAMPLE OF THIS FIRST FORM IS GIVEN BY THE RULES FOR MARITIME GENERAL AVERAGE KNOWN AS THE YORKANTWERP RULES BECAUSE ADOPTED AT A CON FERENCE AT YORK AND MODIFIED BY A LATER CONFERENCE AT ANTWERP THE WONDERFUL FEATURE OF THESE RULES WHICH NOW GOVERN THE COMMERCE OF THE WORLD IS THAT THEY CAME INTO EFFECT BY VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT BETWEEN UNDERWRITERS SHIPPERS AND SHIPOWNERS TO MAKE ALL THEIR CONTRACTS SUBJECT TO THESE RULES4 IT TOOK TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF EFFORT TO REACH THIS AGREEMENT BUT IT IS NOW AS SOLID AS ANY LAW CAN BE B UNIFORM NATIONAL LEGISLATION THE SECOND METHOD THOUGH HITHERTO SUCCESSFUL IN OUR INTERSTATE LAW HAS HAD LESS RAPID PROG RESS INTERNATIONALLY ONE PRINCIPAL REASON IS THAT THE DRAFTING BODIES AT THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT PER SONS FROM THE NATIONAL LEGISLATURES AND THE NATIONAL LEGISLATURES WHEN OFFERED THE DRAFT FOR RATIFICATION ARE SLOW TO SEE THE NECES SITY FOR MAKING THE COMPROMISES WHICH ARE INEVITABLE IN SUCH MATTERS ALTHOUGH THE EXPERTS AT THEIR INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES CAN SEE THE NECESSITY PLAINLY ENOUGH NEVERTHELESS THIS IS THE ONLY METHOD THAT CAN ULTIMATELY TAKE CARE OF THE BULK OF THE COMMERCIAL SUBSTANTIVE LAW THAT MAY HAVE TO BECOME UNIFORM C UNIFORM ADMINISTRATIVE RULES THIS METHOD HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN CERTAIN FIELDS BUT ITS SCOPE IS INEVITABLY LIMITED5 4 INDIVIDUAL EFFORT HAS DONE MORE TO SPREAD THE VOGUE OF THESE RULES THAN ALL THE REPORTS OF OFFICIAL COMMISSIONS TO THEIR VARIOUS GOVERNMENTS BOUSQUET COMMENTAIRE PRATIQUE DES REGLES DYORK ET DANVERS 1916 P 25 6 BESIDES THE MONOGRAPH OF AMBASSADOR REINSCH PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL UNIONS 1910 THE FOLLOWING WORKS DESCRIBE SOME OF THESE UNIONS COMBES DE LESTRADE LA VIE INTERNATIONALE PARIS 1911 RAYMOND L BRIDGMAN FIRST BOOK OF WORLD LAW BOSTON 1911 428PROBLEMS OF WORLDLEGISLATION THE POSTAL UNION IS THE BEST EXAMPLE THE EXECUTIVE DEPART MENTS OF THE SEVERAL STATES SEND DELEGATES TO A CONFERENCE AND THEN SEVERALLY ADOPT THE RULES AGREED UPON INTERNATIONALLY THE GREAT FEATURE OF THIS METHOD IS THAT HERE THE INTERNATIONAL LEGIS LATORS ARE EXPERTS IN THEIR FIELD INTERNATIONAL LEGISLATION BY DIP LOMATS ONLY IS BOUND TO BE A FAILURE THE GENERAL TRAINING OF THE DIPLOMAT DOES NOT FIT HIM TO UNDERSTARD THE TECHNICAL INTER ESTS INVOLVED THE MORAL IS THAT THE INTERNATIONAL LEGISLATORS OF THE FUTURE MUST BE PROFESSIONAL EXPERTS IN THE SPECIFIC SUBJECT THAT IS WE NEED NEVER EXPECT OUTSIDE OF THE PURELY POLITICAL FIELD OF PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW AND INSIDE THE NUMEROUS FIELDS OF PRIVATE LAW THAT A SINGLE GENERAL INTERNATIONAL LEGISLATURE WILL BE OF ANY EFFICIENCY THERE MUST BE SUCCESSIVE SPECIAL LEGIS LATURES CREATED AD HOC FOR EACH SPECIAL SUBJECT D UNIFORM RULES FOR CONFLICT OF LAWS THIS METHOD SUFFICES VERY WELL FOR A FEW SUBJECTS SUCH AS MARRIAGE DIVORCE AND SUC CESSION BUT FOR COMMERCIAL LAW IT IS NOT ADEQUATE A MAIN REASON IS THAT IT MAINTAINS IN EVERY COUNTRY TWO RULES OF LAW THE LOCAL AND THE INTERNATIONAL AND IN COMMERCE THIS IS A DETRIMENT I NOW COME AFTER THESE EXPLANATIONS TO A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF MY MAIN THEME BY WHAT METHODS CAN THE UNITED STATES TAKE EFFECTIVE PART IN WORLDLEGISLATION  LET ME REMIND YOU THAT THERE ARE ONLY THESE FOUR METHODS ONE OF THEM CALLS FOR VOLUNTARY CHANGE OF USAGE BY PARTIES IN TERESTED AS IN THE YORKANTWERP RULES FOR GENERAL AVERAGE ANOTHER COMES TO PASS BY REGULATIONS ADOPTED BY AN EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTAS IN THE POSTAL REGULATIONS BOTH OF THESE ARE THEREFORE VERY LIMITED IN POSSIBILITIES FOR US THE REMAINING TWO METHODS BOTH REQUIRE LEGISLATION I E EITHER NATIONAL LEGIS LATION ADOPTING A SINGLE RULE FOR SOLVING CONFLICTS OF LAW OR NA TIONAL LEGISLATION ASSIMILATING THE SEVERAL NATIONAL BODIES OF SUBSTANTIVE LAW SO THAT NO CONFLICTS OF LAW CAN ARISE ASSUMING THEREFORE FOR PRACTICAL PURPOSES THAT LEGISLATIVE ACTION BY AMERICA IS NECESSARY WHENEVER INTERNATIONAL UNIFORM ITY BECOMES DESIRABLE FOR US WE ASK WHAT IS OUR LEGAL CAPACITY 429VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW AS A NATION TO ENACT SUCH LEGISLATION AND THUS TO PERFORM AND TO OBTAIN OUR SHARE IN OFFERING AN ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION I IN VITE YOUR CONSIDERATION TO THE FOLLOWING THREE ASSERTIONS I THE FEDERAL LEGISLATURE OF THE UNITED STATES HAS NO POWER TO ADOPT A UNIFORM INTERNATIONAL RULE WHICH SHALL BE ACTUALLY EF FECTIVE THROUGHDUT THE COUNTRY IT HAS ONLY TWO VERY LIMITED POWERS EACH OF WHICH WILL STILL LEAVE AT LEAST TWO DISTINCT RULES OF LAW IN OPERATION WITHIN EACH STATE A THE FIRST IS ITS POWER OVER INTERSTATE AND FOREIGN COMMERCE B THE SECOND IS ITS POWER TO MAKE TREATIES FOR SOLVING CONFLICTS OF LAW II THE SEVERAL STATE LEGISLATURES HAVE ALL THE REMAINING POWER TO ADOPT A UNIFORM INTERNATIONAL RULE BUT THEY NEVER HAVE EXER CISED AND NEVER WILL UNITEDLY EXERCISE THIS POWER BY ADOPTING SOME UNIFORM INTERNATIONAL RULE AND THEREFORE THE PROSPECT OF ANY SHARE FOR US IN WORLDLEGISLATION IS HOPELESS BY THIS METHOD III THE SEVERAL STATE LEGISLATURES DO HAVE THE POWER TO SHARE INDIVIDUALLY IN WORLDLEGISLATION BY AVAILING THEMZSELVES OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL LIBERTY UNDER ART I SECTION O1 TO MAKE AGREE MENTS OR COMPACTS WITH A FOREIGN POWER WITH THE CONSENT OF CONGRESS AND IT IS THEREFORE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR THE FUTURE INTERNATIONAL SELFRESPECT OF THIS COUNTRY THAT THIS POWER SHOULD BE PROMPTLY EXERCISED BY THE LEADING COMMERCIAL STATES OF THE UNITED STATES I NOW PROCEED BRIEFLY TO EXPLAIN THE BASIS FOR THESE THREE AS SERTIONS I I THE FIRST ASSERTION NEEDS BUT LITTLE COMMENT THE FEDERAL LEGISLATURE HAS NO POWER TO ADOPT AN INTERNATIONAL RULE UNI FORMLY ADOPTED ELSEWHERE WHICH SHALL BE ACTUALLY EFFECTIVE THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY FOR ITS POWERS ARE EXPRESSLY LIMITED A THE FIRST ONE THAT MIGHT HELP US IS THE POWER TO LEGISLATE FOR INTERSTATE AND FOREIGN COMMERCE BUT PLAINLY THIS IS INADE QUATE 1 FOR ONE THING ITS SUBJECT IS NARROW IT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE VITAL SUBJECTS OF CRIMINAL POLICE PROPERTY FAMILY LAW CORPORATIONS INSURANCE COMMERCIAL CONTRACTS AND OTHERS EVEN 430PROBLEMS OF WORLDLEGISLATION COMMERCIAL PAPER IS WITHOUT ITS SCOPE AND AT THE 1912 HAGUE CONFERENCE ON THAT SUBJECT THE AMERICAN DELEGATE WAS OBLIGED TO REFRAIN FROM VOTING WITH THE HUMILIATING CONFESSION THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS NO AUTHORITY TO LEGISLATE REGARDING BILLS OF EXCHANGE 6 2 SECONDLY A FEDERAL INTERSTATE FOREIGN COMMERCE RULE LEAVES THE LOCAL STATE RULE STILL IN FORCE THERE WILL ALWAYS BE TWO RULES AND THEREFORE DIVERSITY OF LAW FOR EXAMPLE THE THOUSANDS OF BILLS AND CHECKS DAILY EXCHANGED AT OUR CHICAGO BANKS ARE NOW SUBJECT TO A UNIFORM NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENT LAW FOR AMERICAN TRANSACTIONS BUT EVEN IF THE FED ERAL CONGRESS HAD THE POWER TO ADOPT AN INTERNATIONAL RULE THERE WOULD STILL BE A SEPARATE AND OFTEN DIFFERENT LAW FOR THE INSTRU MENTS REPRESENTING LOCAL TRANSACTIONS THUS THE FEDERAL COM MERCE POWER IS GROSSLY INADEQUATE TO GIVE US A SHARE IN UNIFORM WORLDLEGISLATION B THE OTHER FEDERAL POWER IS THE TREATY POWER APPLIED TO SOLVE CONFLICTS OF LAW THIS POWER HAS NEVER BEEN EXERCISED FOR THAT PURPOSE WE HAVE REFRAINED FROM SIGNING THE HAGUE RULES OF 1904 FOR PRIVATE INTERNATIONAL LAW SOCALLED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HESITATES TO EXERCISE THIS UNTRIED POWER WE SHOULD UNQUESTIONABLY TRY TO EXERCISE IT AND THUS TEST ITS EXISTENCE BUT WHETHER WE HAVE IT AT ALL IS DOUBTFUL AND EVEN IF WE HAVE IT NO REAL UNIFORMITY IS SECURED BY IT BUT MERELY A UNIFORM RULE FOR SOLVING CONFLICTS OF DIVERSE LAW THESE TWO FEDERAL POWERS THEN ARE SO LIMITED THAT THEY SEND US CRIPPLED INTO AN LINTERNATIONAL LEGISLATIVE CONFERENCE THEY CAN NEVER SERVE ADEQUATELY FOR THAT PURPOSE 6 MR CONANT IN REPORT OF THE DELEGATE JULY 21 P 118 AND AT THE SECOND CONVENTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL HIGH COMMISSION TO LATIN AMERICA MR UNTERMYER A UNITED STATES DELEGATE IN A MEMORANDUM SUBMITTED P 15 COMMITTEE REPORTS ETC OF NATIONAL HIGH COMMIS SION WASHINGTON 1916 USED THESE SIGNIFICANT WORDS AS A RESULT OF THE WELLRECOGNIZED CONSTITUTIONAL RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS UNDER WHICH OUR DELEGATES LABOR IN DEALING WITH THIS SUBJECT WE ARE NATURALLY MOST RELUCTANT TO ADVANCE SUGGESTIONS OF ANY CHARACTER    OUR RELUCTANCE IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT WE ARE UNFORTUNATELY UNABLE TO CON TRIBUTE IN FULL MEASURE TO OUR SHARE OF THE COMPROMISES THAT ARE INEVIT ABLY INVOLVED IN REACHING A COMPLETE AGREEMENT ON SO COMPLICATED A QUESTION 431VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW II II THE SECOND ASSERTION PROVES ITSELF THE SEVERAL STATE LEGIS LATURES HAVE ALL THE REMAINING POWER TO MAKE UNIFORM OUR LAW WHEN DESIRED BUT THEY HAVE NEVER EXERCISED THAT POWER COIP ERATIVELY FOR AN INTERNATIONAL RULE AND THEY NEVER WILL THIS PROPHECY MAY SEEM EXTREMELY POSITIVE BUT IT WILL BE REMEM BERED THAT ALL SUCH INTERNATIONAL UNIFORM RULES WOULD HAVE TO COME TO OUR SEVERAL STATES AS RULES ALREADY ADOPTED ABROAD AND TRANSMITTED DIPLOMATICALLY TO AND THROUGH OUR FEDERAL STATE DEPARTMENT NOW THE FEDERAL STATE DEPARTMENT HAS NEVER EVEN COMMUNICATED ANY OF THEM TO THE STATES NOTABLE EXAMPLES ARE THE HAGUE CONFERENCE RULES OF 1904 FOR MARRIAGE DIVORCE AND JUDICIAL EXECUTIONS AND EVEN IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD COMMUNICATE ANY OF THEM WE MAY WELL BELIEVE THAT THE STATE LEGISLATURES IN ANY APPRECIABLE NUMBER WILL NEVER PAY EF FECTIVE ATTENTION AMIDST THE LOCAL PRESSURE OF BILLS TO THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATION OF FOREIGN PROPOSALS AND MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL A BODY OF RULES ADOPTED BY EUROPEAN NATIONS FOUNDED IN PART ON THE ROMAN CIVIL SYSTEM DIFFERING AT VITAL POINTS FROM OURS AND OFFERED IN GROSS WOULD NEVER BE ADOPTED BY AN AMER ICAN STATE LEGISLATURE HENCE THE ASSERTION THAT FOR INTERNATIONAL PURPOSES THIS MODE OF SECURING AMERICAN UNIFORMITY IS PRACTICALLY OUT OF THE QUES TION AND EVEN WERE IT FEASIBLE IT IS HUMILIATING FOR IT WOULD CONSIST IN ABANDONING OUR OWN LAW AND ADOPTING A FOREIGN LAW THERE WOULD BE NO POSSIBILITY OF THAT FAIR COMPROMISE AND MU TUAL SACRIFICE AND GAIN WHICH IS THE ONLY TRUE BASIS FOR UNIFORM ITY III III I COME THEREFORE TO THE THIRD AND FINAL ASSERTION THE ONE IN WHICH I HOPE TO ENLIST YOUR ACTIVE INTERESTTHE METHOD BY WHICH ALONE AMERICA CAN HAVE ANY SUBSTANTIAL PROSPECT OF OB TAINING ITS DUE SHARE IN THE SHAPING OF WORLDLEGISLATION THAT ASSERTION IS THE SEVERAL STATE LEGISLATURES DO HAVE THE POWER TO SHARE BY INDIZIDUAL ACTION IN WORLDLEGISLATION IF THEY AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL LIBERTY UNDER ART I SEC O1 TO 432PROBLEMS OF WORLDLEGISLATION MAKE AGREEMENTS OR COMPACTS ZCRITH ONE OR MORE FOREIGN POWERS WITH THE CONSENT OF CONGRESS I SHALL NOT DELAY YOU BY ATTEMPTING TO SPECULATE UPON THE POS SIBLE JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION OF THE SCOPE OF THAT CLAUSE OF THE CONSTITUTION ENOUGH TO SAY THAT IT HAS BEEN USED BY THE SEV ERAL STATES IN A DOZEN OR SO OF INSTANCES THAT IT HAS BEEN INTER PRETED IN ONLY HALF A DOZEN DECISIONS OF THE FEDERAL SUPREME COURT AND THAT THERE IS NOTHING THUS FAR IN THOSE DECISIONS TO PREVENT THE AMPLE USE OF THE POWER FOR THE PURPOSE WITH WHICH I AM NOW CONCERNED I DESIRE RATHER TO ASK YOUR ATTENTION TO THE FEASIBLE METHOD OF PROCEDURE AND TO ITS OBVIOUS UTILITY IN GIVING AMERICA A DUE SHARE IN NECESSARY WORLDLEGISLATION 1 PROCEDURE FIRST OF ALL CONGRESS WOULD BY GENERAL LAW GIVE ITS CONSENT IN ADVANCE THAT A STATE MAY MAKE A COMPACT WITH ONE OR MORE FOREIGN POWERS UPON A SPECIFIED SUBJECT OF LAWLET US SAY FOR EXAMPLE THE LAW OF WAREHOUSE RECEIPTS NEXT WHEN AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE IS CALLED ON THE LAW OF THAT SUBJECT ONE OR TWO IMPORTANT COMMERCIAL STATES LIKE VIR GINIA OR ILLINOIS OR NEW YORK WILL BY ITS LEGISLATURE AUTHORIZE DELEGATES TO BE SENT TO THAT CONFERENCE TO SIGN A CONVENTION THE DELEGATES WILL INCLUDE A SENATOR A REPRESENTATIVE AND TWO OR THREE EMINENT PROFESSIONAL EXPERTS IN THE LEGAL AND COMMERCIAL FIELDS INVOLVED THESE DELEGATES WILL HAVE VOTING POWERS IN THE CONFERENCE HENCE THEIR ARGUMENTS AND VOTES WILL AVAIL TO SECURE SOME COMPROMISE IN FAVOR OF IMPORTANT AMERICAN ICEAS FI NALLY THE DRAFT ADOPTED BY THE CONFERENCE WILL BE BROUGHT BACK DIRECTLY TO THE VIRGINIA OR ILLINOIS OR NEW YORK LEGISLATURE FOR RATIFICATION AND THE PERSONAL INTEREST OF THE DELEGATION THE INFLUENCE OF THE LEGISLATIVE MEMBERS IN THE DELEGATION AND THE STATE PRIDE IN HAVING SHARED IN A WORLDCONFERENCE WILL PRESENT SOME STRONG PROSPECT OF SECURING ADOPTION THUS THE INTERNA TIONAL RULE WILL BECOME THE RULE FOR THAT STATE THEREAFTER ITS ACCEPTANCE BY ONE OR MORE POWERFUL AMERICAN STATES FOR THAT CLASS OF COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS WILL INDUCE AND IN SOME CASES WILL COMPEL OTHER STATES TO FOLLOW THE EXAMPLE AND THUS THE UNIFORMITY WILL GRADUALLY BE ATTAINED SUCH WILL BE THE PROCED URE 433VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW 2 NLOW LET US TAKE A GLANCE AT THE GREAT ADVANTAGES OF THAT METHOD AS CONTRASTED WITH THE INADEQUACY OF ANY OTHER METHOD A PROMPTNESS BOTH THE FEDERAL CONGRESS AND THE FEDERAL STATE DEPARTMENT ARE EXTREMELY SLOW TO TAKE UP SUCH MATTERS THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS ESPECIALLY SLOW IT IS ALREADY OVER WHELMED WITH INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL BUSINESS EVEN IN TIME OF PEACE THE SPIRIT OF ITS PERSONNEL IS TO DISPATCH FIRST THOSE AFFAIRS ON WHICH THERE IS THE MOST PRESSURE TO ACT AND IN THE FIELD OF PRIVATE LAW IT CANNOT BE RELIED UPON TO INITIATE ANYTHING FOR EXAMPLE NOT THE SLIGHTEST STEPS HAVE EVER BEEN TAKEN TO SECURE EITHER CON GRESSIONAL OR STATE ACTION ON THE SUBJECTS OF THE HAGUE CONFER ENCE OLF 1904 ON CONFLICT OF LAWS NOR OF THE HAGUE CONFERENCES OF 1910 AND 1912 ON BILLS OF EXCHANGE LAW THOSE PROTOCOLS ARE SIMPLY BURIED IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT ON THE OTHER HAND A STATE DELEGATION COMING BACK FROM AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE IS CERTAIN TO APPLY IMMEDIATELY TO ITS STATE LEGISLATURE AND TO PRESS FOR ACTION AS A PROBABLE INSTRUMENT OF PROMPTNESS THEREFORE THE STATE COMPACT METHOD IS DECIDEDLY SUPERIOR B FREEDOM OF ACTION FOR THE PROGRESSIVE STATES BY THE METHOD OF STATE COMPACTS THE PROGRESSIVE COMMERCIAL STATES LIKE NEW YORK VIRGINIA MASSACHUSETTS PENNSYLVANIA AND ILLINOIS WILL HAVE IT IN THEIR OWN POWER TO GO ONWARDS INDEPENDENTLY WITHOUT WAITING FOR THE COOPERATION OF OTHER SLOW AND TARDY STATES OR OF STATES HAVING NO SUCH IMPORTANT INTERESTS IN JEO PARDY C STABILITY FURTHERMORE THE STATE COMPACT METHOD IS THE ONLY ONE WHICH WILL GIVE STABILITY TO INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS THE OTHER METHOD I E THE MERE VOLUNTARY ADOPTION BY ONE OR MORE STATES OF SOME UNIFORM LAW GIVES NO CERTAINTY THAT IT WILL NOT BE CHANGED IN A YEAR OR TWO BUT THE PARTIES TO AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE NEED TO KNOW THAT THE LAW AS AGREED ON WILL REMAIN UNCHANGED FOR A SPECIFIED PERIOD AT LEAST AND BY THE STATE COM PACT METHOD THE TREATY CAN SO PROVIDE IF DESIRED D DOMINANCE OF AMERICAN IDEAS FOURTHLY AND MOST IM PORTANT OF ALL THIS IS THE ONLY METHOD OUTSIDE OF THE LIMITED FEDERAL FIELD OF INTERSTATE AND FOREIGN COMMERCE BY WHICH AMER ICA CAN HOPE TO OBTAIN ANY FAIR SHARE FOR THE INFLUENCE OF AMER 434PROBLEMS OF WORLDLEGISLATION ICAN IDEAS IN WORLDLEGISLATION IF POWERFUL AMERICAN STATES CAN ENTER THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE WITH A BODY OF PLENIPO TENTIARY DELEGATES HAVING VOTING POWERS THEY CAN BARGAIN AND CAN THUS OBTAIN THE RECOGNITION OF SOME OF THEIR OWN RULES AS A PART OF THE BARGAIN THERE IS A LAMENTABLE CONTRAST VISIBLE BE TWEEN THE POWERS OF THE AMERICAN DELEGATES IN THE HAGUE CON FERENCES ON INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION AND WAR LAW AND THEIR POW ERS IN THE HAGUE CONFERENCES ON BILLS OF EXCHANGE IN THE FOR MER THEY WERE ABLE TO PREVAIL ON SOME VITAL POINTS IN THE LATTER THEY WERE UNABLE TO VOTE OR TO BARGAIN ARID IN FACT THE CONFER ENCE RESULTED IN THE TRIUMPH OF PURELY CONTINENTAL IDEAS AT MANY OR MOST OF THE VITAL POINTS OF DIVERSITY AND IF A WORLDCON FERENCE HAS ADOPTED A UNIFORM CODE WITH AMERICAN IDEAS LEFT OUT THE LEGISLATURES OF AMERICA WILL BE OBLIGED EITHER TO ADOPT IT IN ITS FOREIGN SHAPE MOULDED BY THE BARGAINS OF FOREIGN POWERS AMONG THEMSELVES OR TO REJECT IT AND THUS TO REMAIN BEHIND IN THE HIGHROAD OF INTERNATIONAL UNITY SUFFERING ALL THE DISADVAN TAGES OF DIVERSITY AND CONFLICTS OF LAW THEY WILL IN EITHER CASE HAVE LOST THE CHANCE OF IMPRESSING UPON INTERNATIONAL LEGISLATION SOMETHING OF AMERICAN FEATURES WHAT IS BEING DONE AND NOW A FINAL WORD TO MENTION WHAT IS BEING DONE AT THIS MOMENT TO FORWARD THIS IDEA OF USING THE STATE COMPACT AS A MEANS TO REDEEM OUR SHARE IN WORLDLEGISLATION TWO THINGS ARE BEING DONE 1 THE INTERNATIONAL HIGH COMMISSION FORMED IN 1916 TO ORGANIZE CLOSE RELATIONS WITH LATINAMERICA APPOINTED IN THAT YEAR A COMMITTEE ON UNIFORM LEGISLATION THE CHAIRMAN IS JOHN BASSETT MOORE AND AMONG THE MEMBERS ARE SAMUEL UNTER MYER OF NEW YORK AND LEO ROWE OF PHILADELPHIA THE COM MITTEE HAS FOUND ITSELF SERIOUSLY OBSTRUCTED BY THIS IMPOTENCE OF FEDERAL LEGISLATION7 MR MCGUIRE ITS ASSISTANT SECRETARY WAS 7 SEE THE MEMORANDUM OF MR UNTERMYER ALREADY CITED ALSO THE RE PORTS OF MR P J EDER AND MR C S HAIGHT ON BILLS OF EXCHANGE LAW AND BILLS OF LADING LAW RESPECTIVELY MADE TO SECRETARY MCADOO FOR THE INTERNATIONAL HIGH COMMISSION WASHINGTON 1916 435VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW SENT BY THE COMMISSION TO CHICAGO TO ATTEND THE 1916 MEETING OF THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION AND OF THE NATIONAL CONFER ENCE ON UNIFORM STATE LAWS AND THROUGH HIM THE COMMISSION WILL NOW TAKE UP THE POSSIBILITIES OF USING THIS METHOD IN THEIR EFFORTS FOR UNIFORMITY WITH LATINAMERICA 2 THE OTHER QUARTER IN WHICH SOMETHING IS BEING DONE IS THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF COMMISSIONERS ON UNIFORM STATE LAWS AT ITS RECENT MEETING IN CHICAGO IN AUGUST 1916 A BRIEF ON THE LEGAL POSSIBILITIES OF ART I SEC 10 OF THE CONSTITU TION WAS PRESENTED BY GEORGE D AYRES COMMISSIONER FROM IDAHO MR AYRES IS PRIMARILY INTERESTED IN THE AVAILABILITY OF THIS CLAUSE TO ASSIST UNIFORMITY OF LAW BETWEEN OUR OWN STATES MEANWHILE THE INTERNATIONAL ASPECT OF IT HAD BEEN NOTED BY MY SELF IN A PAPER PRESENTED TO THE SECOND PANAMERICAN SCIENTIFIC CONGRESS HELD IN WASHINGTON LAST JANUARY AT THE CHICAGO MEETING THEREFORE ON MOTION OF MR AYRES SECONDED BY MYSELF THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF COMMISSIONERS HAS NOW APPOINTED A COMMITTEE OF WHICH MR AYRES IS CHAIRMAN TO REPORT AT THE NEXT ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON THE LEGAL AND POLITICAL POSSIBILITIES OF THE STATE COMPACT METHOD FOR ADVANCING THE CAUSE OF UNIFORM ITY BOTH NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL CONCLUSION IN CONCLUSION THEN I REPEAT THE ASSERTION THAT THE STATE COM PACT METHOD IS THE ONLY METHOD WHICH OFFERS ANY SUBSTANTIAL PROSPECT TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FOR MAINTAINING THEIR SELFRESPECT AND INFLUENCE IN THE FIELD OF INTERNATIONAL PRIVATE LAW DURING THE NEXT GENERATION WHICH WILL BE A GENERATION OF WORLDLEGISLATION AND I BESPEAK THE INTEREST OF THE ENLIGHT ENED PUBLIC AND THE LEGAL PROFESSION IN THIS ENDEAVOR TO SOLVE THE GREATEST LEGAL PROBLEM OF THE FUTURE THAT AFFECTS THE WORLD WELFARE OF OUR BELOVED COUNTRY JOHN

to take away any of them lightly But some restraint or punishment is necessary Ve often miss our aim however by prescribing punishments that are too severe whereupon human nature revolts so that it is impossible to combine certainty with severity a lesson we have long since learned from the ex perience of England During a period of fifteen years in that country 555 verdicts were rendered in which the jury fixed the amount stolen from a dwelling at 39 shillings when it was a capital offense to steal 40 shillings and when the law changed the amount to 5 pounds the juries merely raised the value to 4 pounds I9 shillings As late as 1830 the punishment for forgery was death in that year a thousand bankers residing in 214 municipalities presented to Parliament the celebrated petition in which they declared that they find by experience that the infliction of death or even a possibility of the infliction of death prevents the prosecution conviction and punishment of the criminal and thus endangers the property which it is intended to protect After the execution of Fauntleroy the lawyers of England signed a similar petition stating that if the Crown would cease punishing forgery by death the crime would become less frequent and when hanging for that offense was abolished the crime became rare But it is unnecessary in this day and age to dwell further upon the proposition that punishments which are severe cannot be inflicted with certainty We may now proceed to discuss mild punishments first noting another element in deterrence that is to say swiftness     it is necessary that the punishment should be as near in 1 An address delivered before the National Association of Attorneys General of the United StatesMICHIGAN LAW REVIEYV point of time to the crime as possible because its impression upon the minds of men is weakened by distance and because this distance adds to the uncertainty of its infliction by affording fresh chances of escape As this important element is dependent upon criminal procedure it can properly be left without further notice here It is but natural that criminal punishments should be severe for the measure is fixed by legislator and judge alike with no thought that it will ever be applied to him they therefore partake of the cruelty inseparable from power and often include revenge which as we are aware is no part of real punishment Properly organized society in its relation to the criminal is never revengeful It is a bee which stings to defendnot a wasp which pursues to destroy If we could consider an offense which has been committed as an isolated fact the like of which would never recur punishment would be useless Let us now open the pages of a great book a century and a half old written by a humanitarian in an age of cruelty one of the few books that have come down to us with the badge of authority It was 20 years in the building and the only work of the author which securely linked him to future agesindeed there seems to be in the life of a man only time enoughin the brain of a man only genius enoughfor one great book The author was a citizen of that great nation which in the present war has earned the admiration of the world In THE SPIRIT oF TIIE LAWS a few pages only are devoted to pun ishment and a short passage will serve to remind us of MONThS QUIEUs views upon the subject in hand Experience shows that in countries remarkable for the lenity of penal laws the spirit of the inhabitants is as much affected by them as in other countries by severer punishments If an inconveniency or abuse arises in the state a violent govern ment endeavors suddenly to redress it and instead of putting the old laws in execution it establishes some cruel punishment which instantly puts a stop to the evil But the spring of government is thereby weakened the imagination grows accustomed to the severe as well as to the milder punishment and as the fear of the latter diminishes they are soon obliged in every case to have recourse to the other Men must not be led by excess of violence we ought to make a prudent use of the means which nature has given us to conduct them If we inquire into the cause of all human corruptions we 458MILD PUNISHMENTS shall find that they proceed from the impunity of crimes and not from the moderation of punishments When this book appeared an Italian lad was pursuing his studies Ten years later at the age of 26 inspired by MONTESQUIEU he gave to the world another great book combining philosophy with human ity and gallantly challenging the accepted penal theories of his day This work2 also was its authors only claim upon immortality He says Crimes are more effectually prevented by the certainty than the severity of punishment    The certainty of a small punishment will make a stronger impression than the fear of one more severe if attended with the hopes of escaping for it is the nature of man kind to be terrified at the approach of the smallest inevitable evil whilst hope the best gift of Heaven hath the power of dispelling the apprehension of a greater especially if supported by examples of impunity which weakness or avarice too frequently afford If punishments be very severe men are naturally led to the per petration of other crimes to avoid the punishment due to the first The countries and times most notorious for severity of punishments were always those in which the most bloody and inhuman actions and the most atrocious crimes were committed for the hand of the legislator and the assassin were directed by the same spirit of feroc ity which on the throne dictated laws of iron to slaves and savages and in private instigated the subject to sacrifice one tyrant to make room for another In proportion as punishments become more cruel the minds of men as a fluid rises to the same height with that which surrounds it grow hardened and insensible and the force of passions still continuing in the space of an hundred years the wheel terrifies no more than formerly the prison There are yet two other consequences of cruel punishments which counteract the purpose of their institution which was to prevent crimes The first arises from the impossibility of establish ing an exact proportion between the crime and punishment for though ingenious cruelty hath greatly multiplied the variety of tor ments yet the human frame can suffer only to a certain degree beyond which it is impossible to proceed be the enormity of the crime ever so great The second consequence is impunity Human nature is limited no less in evil than in good Excessive barbarity can never be more than temporary it being impossible that it should be supported by a permanent system of legislation for if the laws 2 Becarria Crimes and Punishments 459MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW be too cruel they must be altered or anarchy and impunity will succeed This work of BECCARIA at the time was bitterly assailed particu larly by the lawyers it was placed upon the Roman Index and the vocabulary of hate and scorn was entirely exhausted But the mes sage spread far and wide Few books have influenced so profoundly the thought and indeed the legislation of the Continentvery few within the lifetime of the author The immediate effect was to accelerate the abolition of torture then almost universal but in a short time a broad and general result followed One instance will suffice A revised edition appeared in I781 five years later Leopold became Grand Duke of Tuscany and substituted a mild system of punishments whereupon there ensued a decrease in the number of offenses For a long time the prisons were empty The experiment was continued and after 20 years Leopold declares That the miti gation of punishments joined to the most scrupulous attention to prevent crimes and also great despatch in the trial together with a certainty and suddenness of punishment to real delinquents had in stead of increasing the number of crimes considerably diminished that of the smaller ones and rendered those of an atrocious nature very rare The result was reached by mild punishments combined with pre vention swiftness and certainty but without mild punishments neither of the last two is possible Contemporaneously with Ieopolds innovation BENTHAM after eight years of labor brought to final form his theories of punishment Treating lightly the work of 1MONTESQUIcJE U and disowning any BECCARIAN considerations of human sympathy proceeding exclusive ly on the theory of utilityof the greatest happinesshe arrived at the same result indicated in the following words It is therefore true that the more the certainty of punishment can be augmented the more it may be diminished in amount In a span of fifty years the influence of MONTrEsQUIEU and BEc CARIA reached America and received marked recognition from a man endowed with one of the greatest legal minds which this country ever producedEDWARD LIVINTGSTON After a successful professional and political career in New York City he moved to New Orleans where he took the highest rank as a lawyer and scholar He was the author of the Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure and a jointauthor of the Civil Code of that state He was employed by the General Assembly to write the Penal Code which was prepared and published and republished in London and 460MILD PUNISHMENTS Paris but failed of adoption Its principles however including mild punishments were formally endorsed by the General Assembly and became the basis of a number of codes in South American countries Accompanying a preliminary sketch and also the later and final draft are introductions which constitute one of the most remarkable contributions to the literature of penal law and are at the same time rare examples of rhetoric logic and learning LIVINGSTON had been brought up under the Common Law and his change of residence compelled him owing to the peculiar history of Louisiana to master three other systems of jurisprudence He was obliged to prepare his draft of the Penal Code in French as well as English and there is in literary annals no more dramatic picture than this prodigy in the evening of life an exile from the land of his triumphs sitting at his lamp rewriting the entire work for the manuscript had met the well known fate of CARLYIXS first manu script of THE FRRNCH REVOLUTTONjust as it was completed and ready for the printer it was destroyed by fire The theory of mild punishments and the humane viewpoint out of which it arose together with the general agitation of the subject eventually led us into modified methods of treating the criminal which are matters of common knowledge the abolition of contract labor for convicts the establishment of Juvenile Courts the indeter minate sentence and its accompanying parole law the probation law An instance in each case will sufficiently illustrate the operation of the two laws last mentioned In the penitentiary at Joliet Illinois of the 69Io prisoners who have been paroled in twentyone years beginning with the enactment of the parole law less than ten a year on the average have returned under a new sentenceonly five during the two years ending Sep tember 30 I914 the date of the last biennial report and less than 17 per cent have in any manner violated their parole This law has now been adopted in more than thirty states of the Union Under the probation law of England when guilt is established no actual sentence is passed at the time ASC1IAIFFENBURG3 in referring to the operation of this law says that from I888 to I906 cases to the number of I8ooo arose under it and the law operated successfully in all but a trifle more than I500 instances84 per cent ASCHAFFENBURG by the way believes in abolishing the death penalty he brushes aside all other arguments and adopts the all sufficient one that its retention will have no greater influence than its 3 Crime and its Repression I9o6 46IMICHIGAN LAW REVIEW abolition It is a matter of interest also that he regards alco hol as one of the most important inciters to crime not only in the im mediate generation but in the offspring observing that all crimes chiefly caused by alcohol are increasing and that the increase corres ponds to the steady increase in the consumption of alcoholnot in spirits but in beer This conclusion is notable emanating as it does from a German who bases his conclusions upon conditions in Ger many alone and who writes not of temperance generally but as a scientist upon the question of criminality In the field of criminology BECCARIA was preceded by other Italian philosophers and was destined to be followed by still others Italy in this regard has been so far in advance of the other nations that it has been styled the fatherland of the criminal law which is not strange for this is the land of the Romans the great lawgivers of all time One of these Italian thinkers and writers born six months after the death of LIVINGSTON startled the world in 1875 by proclaiming and assuming to prove that 35 per cent of all criminals are so born and bear physical marks of abnormality LOMBROSO was a man of tremendous cerebration but seems to have lacked care in his deductions and his theories are now dis credited He however gave a great impetus to the modern school of criminological theory and had he been an alienist and psychologist the study of criminology would now be much further advanced It must be understood that modern ideas of criminology are pro mulgated by those who in general disclaim any humanitarian views and stand upon the rock of science but the desire for scientific in vestigation which characterizes the presentday philosophers would never have arisen but for the worldwide agitation for milder penalties As might be expected the modern apostles do not agree with one another in all details as to either conditions or remedies but the general statement of the new idea is well phrased by GAROFALO in his work on CRIMINOLOGY Our efforts    are to be directed not to measuring the quan tum of harm to be inflicted upon the criminal but to determining the kind of restraint best fitted to the pecularities of his nature Since the introduction of mild punishments crime has increased in general throughout the world and it has been claimed that the de crease in penalties is the cause and the increase incrime is the effect The claim is however really restricted in its application to chronic offenders 462MILD PUNISHMENTS There are worldcauses for the worldincrease in crime not the least of which is the increase in luxury the great disintegrater of human character Mild punishments can hardly explain the increase in crime since there has been a corresponding increase in defectives and it cannot be claimed that mild punishments have been the cause of the latter Moreover it is morally certain that the increase in crime and the increase in defectives have their roots in the same soil The modern school calls all available science to its aid individual izes the criminal seeks to determine in each instance his real menace to society and considers not only the crime but every other element including the heredity of the criminal his environment and habits his history particutarly that of his youth his physical mental moral and emotional nature his race religion occupation and economic status as well as general conditions respecting the crime when pertinent such as famine heat and in sex crimes the season This individualization of the criminal and treating the criminal rather than the crime as Professor POUND the pen of the profes sion points out is not a novel idea in jurisprudence for example in some fields of chancery jurisprudence we aim to suit the remedy to the man and for that purpose admit evidence of every pertinent fact One invention of the modern school has furnished opportunity and means for such individualization namely the clinic so called where suspects passing through the laboratory of the law in large numbers are subjected to various tests for the purpose of determ ining their proper disposition in view of the welfare of society In Chicago eight years since the first clinic or psychopathic laboratory as an adjunct to an American court was institutedin connection with another Chicago innovation the Juvenile Court About two years ago The Municipal Court of Chicago established its psychopathic laboratory Fortunately that tribunal is presided over by Judge HARRY OLSON who is not only in sympathy with the work but has the proper temperament tle has the enthusiasm with out which nothing important is accomplished and moreover the gift of communicating it to the many judges who are subject to his guidance as Chief Justice The Boys Court branch of The Municipal Court deals with those who are between the ages of T7 and 21 this Chicago laboratory as it may be called has therefore a double advantage it receives cases in great numbers before mental development is arrested and super vises a continuous diurnal procession of suspects within the worlds average criminal age which is between I6 and 24 463MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW The laboratory is in charge of Dr WIILIAMl J HICKSON a specialist in neurology who spent more than two years in intimate association with the masters in the great clinics of Germany a country which in this respect is far in advance of the other nations The work has been greatly facilitated by the fact that the Mlunici pal court has branches for special departments for outside the ordinary criminal branch courts the cases are segregated in the Boys Court the Court of Domestic Relations and the Morals Court respectively this feature and all other things considered the Chicago laboratory has become probably thie greatest in the world Fortunately within the last five days the court has issued an an nual report of which a free use is hereinafter made it sets forth the results of the laboratory investigations from its foundation May I 1914 to January first of this year and covers a great array of 2700 cases The court has jurisdiction of all violations of city ordinances numerous smaller offenses against the state and preliminary hear ings in most of the serious crimes it disposes each year of about I25000 of these cases Laboratory examinations are made daily applied of course to only a comparatively small number of the cases While examination is not compulsory an objection is rarely raised In general only those are examined who indicate that they may be abnormal by appearance or speech or whose abnormality is suggested by the nature of the offense Sometimes the examination is physical at other times mental and neurological and again psychological These investigations supplement an inquiry into the circumstances of the delinquency and the characteristics of the individual his environment and his heredity Parenthetically it may be noted that experience here and abroad proves that cases of a delinquent imposing upon the examiner are al most nil By the psychological tests it is possible wTith accuracy to detect feeblemindedness the degree being expressed by years with the normal development at different ages as a standard but the great contribution to science made by the Chicago laboratory is the demon stration of the frequent alliance of feeblemindedness and dementia praecox This combination has an important significance Those who suffer from the double affliction are liable to become serious offenders and to commit violent criminal assaults Dementia praecox is perhaps the commonest form of mental alienation various esti mates putting those afflicted with it in insane asylums at from fifty 464MILD PUNISHMENTS to sixty per cent of the inmates Most of the sex crimes and crimes of violence are perpetrated by those tainted with this disease Dr HICKSONs report among other things covers various groups in the Boys Court which are designated by the terms average in telligence high grade borderland sociopath high middle and low grade sociopath high grade moron middle grade moron and low grade moron comprising respectively 126 141 117 728 151 and 52 cases In these groups he finds the following percentages re spectively of dementia praecox with or without complications 262 I98 I538 I47 I39 and I346 In a group from the Domestic Relations Court comprising 696 cases he found I767 of the subjects afflicted with dementia prae cox and a great number with ordinary diseases to such an extent that a knowledge of their presence was material to the judgment of the court He found 75 chronic alcoholics and subjects suffering from epilepsy hysteria senile dementia and venereal diseases 70 were mental defectives As the report points out the advantages of such a laboratory in the administration of justice can be readily perceived and some are obvious The judge has before him not only the individual in the flesh and a record of his antecedents history and environment but where desired a report and prognosis upon his physical mental and nervous condition lHe is enabled in many cases by ordering an examination to con firm or refute the statements of the man before the bar as well as the witnesses He has the opportunity as a friend of society to be the means of discovering defects in the individual and to recommend treatment He has at command a medical referee available for use in personal injury suits one who can often be used by suggestion of the court as a check upon the statements of medical witnesses not only in this class of cases but in others He can in many instances avert the postponement of a case where the application is made for the purpose of bringing in a medical certificate the case can be tried wheni ready and much delay and sometimes duplication of effort as well as evidence avoided He is able to level rich and poor by providing an expert physician without charge He can have at hand an opinion which he knows to be unbiased and upon which he and the jury also may rely Above all things he can separate many of those who need treatment from those who need punishment The question naturally arises as to what disposition is made of the subjects proved to be defective rather than criminalin short what use is made of the information obtained 465MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW As to first offenders a warning a parole or a mild punishment is now generally regarded as sufficient but nevertheless some treatment or even special restraint may be indicated by the laboratory report The real problem is the chronic offender Modern criminology has placed at the command of the judge a much wider latitude in punishments than he had in the past He must consider in view of all the data the essential character of the offender and estimate the relative importance of inherited charac teristics and environment and finally must make a guess as to how this almost inscrutable human complex is going to react to one or more of several possible treatments Punishment inevitably comes to be more a treatment of the individual offender than a routine treatment of a type of offense Punishment meted out to the feebleminded may drive the subject into hopeless criminality This is the great truth which explains the frequent failure of the correc tional institution With the feebleminded probation is also doomed to failure and for the same reason on the other hand these unfortunates can im prove outside of institutions in a simple protected environment Those whose feeblemindedness is complicated with dementia prae cox are more dangerous and should be confined in farm or indus trial colonies under proper supervision and might be usefully employed in making roads in the state in clearing land and work of that sort but would need for winter quarters perhaps institutional care and segregation will protect the next generation Some years ago a Chicago boy was executed for murder His guilt was not doubtedhe had confessed the crime MUENSTER BERG however a thousand miles away insisted that the confession was not real In the light of modern criminal psychology the boy is now believed to have been feebleminded and in addition to have been afflicted with dementia praecox If Chicago had then had the benefit of its present laboratory the lad would not have been hanged and horror would not have clutched the family If such institutions are established maintained generally kept on a high plane and continued long enough scientific results should be attained Crime can not be wholly stopped in our day But we can stem the tide that is flowing into the next generation and in that process the modern laboratory is a promising factor The development of science through this instrumentality will lead us to avoid useless and unjust punishment to separate the defectives from the real criminals and to impose penalties that are mild not only mild in the sentence but mild in the execution Recent 466MILD PUNISHMENTS experiments in Illinois have shown that treating prisoners in the penitentiaries including chronic offenders like human beings and not like beasts has produced the most hopeful change By estab lishing an hours recreation period those whom it was found neces sary to punish with solitary confinement for violation of prison rules decreased from 75 a month to 30 and this and other kindred departures from conventional prison discipline caused the prisoners to become healthier in body and mind It is idle to say that this milder execution of sentences will not increase the prisoners power of restraint while in prison and to some extent at least after they leave We have made no progress with the chronic offender He has returned to the institutions with distressing regularity It may well be that the fault has been in our treatment of him As far as we have ameliorated it the results have been more than encouraging We have therefore yet to learn by a fair test whether the changed treatment further extended and established for years will not materially affect the record of chronic offenders When such a test shall have been made we may learn that the great de terrent is mild punishments Chicago ROBERT McMURDY 467

truly inac tive tartaric acid there is a true neutralization within the molecule itself Which of these hypotheses is correct is a question for fur ther work to decide  Gaillards  French for Young Folks New York Werner is constructed on a sound pedagogic plan has numerous and good illustrations and is nicely gotten up It devotes special attention to the subject of French pronunciation and gives some very prac tical directions on the subject We only question whether the intro ductory chapters do not employ too many long words to be easily comprehended by the beginner  The Fish Commission steamer Albatross left Washington last week on her extended cruise to the Pacific coast The voyage was arranged by the late Professor Baird and is now being carried out by his successor Mr G Brown Goode the new commissioner The  Albatross has been engaged for several years in the deep sea work of the Fish Commission in the Atlantic the results ob tained being of great economic and scientific value There has come a demand from the Pacific coast for similar work there where the fisheries have not been developed to any extent little being known of the number or character of the foodfishes of that coast To hunt out the foodfishes locate their habitats and to develop the resources of the great Pacific is the task before the  Albatross which is thoroughly equipped for the scientific work The scien tific party aboard will consist of Prof Leslie A Lee of Bowdoin who goes as chief naturalist Mr Thomas Lee who has been engaged on the deepsea work of the commission for a long time and Mr C H Townsend who has just returned from an expedition to Central America The  Albatross is officered and manned by the navy and is under the command of LieutCom Zera L Tan ner The  Albatross will reach California next May Stops will be made en route which will delay the voyage somewhat the time being occupied by the scientists in making shorecollections The ship goes out without any definite period fixed as to its return but it is not probable the vessel will be seen in the Atlantic again for three or four years It is deemed important to carry on investiga tions not only in the latitude of California but off the Alaska coast The ship will touch frequently at ports on the Pacific coast and be in constant communication with the Fish Commission It is prob able too that from time to time other scientists will join her for the purpose of doing special work The scientific outfit of the vessel is declared by those who have examined it to be the best that was ever put aboard a vessel  Dr Cohn oculist at Breslau has invented a new apparatus for testing the eyesight of children This is a matter which is scarcely attended to at all in this country Periodical tests have shown that there is much more small mischief in the eyes of young students than is generally supposed which can easily be stopped if the neces sary precautions are taken in time Dr Cohns invention con sists of a white board twentyfive centimetres square to which are fastened six rows of hooks shaped thus  one centimetre square He who possesses a normal eyesight will be able to tell at a dis tance of six metres in ordinary daylight in which direction  up wards downwards to the right or to the left  the hooks which are painted of different colors are turned Pupils who cannot do this injure their eyes by constantly looking at the blackboard The same board may be used to determine whether the ordinary day light is sufficient for the rooms As soon as the teacher cannot distinguish the direction of the hooks at a distance of six metres without straining his eyes the gas ought to be lighted at once In the December number of Harpers is an article by Mr George F Kunz the gem expert of Messrs Tiffany

RailwayCompany RETURNING from New York Nov 12 the train was crowded with passengers At the forward end of the car was a large stove full of redhot coals This stove had no guard nor hardly any thing to

J100688,ABSTRACTS OF THE PAPERS PRINTED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,109969,AN ACCOUNT OF THE COMPARISON OF VARIOUS BRITISH STANDARDS OF LINEAR MEASURE ABSTRACT,I207044,139 PRODUCES A RED FLAME WITH THE FORMATION OF MURIATIC ACID IT IS IN SOLUBLE IN WATER AND READILY SOLUBLE IN ALCOHOL ETHER AND OILS AND NEARLY INSOLUBLE IN ACIDS WHEN HEATED WITH SEVERAL METALLIC PEROX IDES IT IS DECOMPOSED WITH THE PRODUCTION OF CARBONIC ACID AND A METALLIC PERCHLORIDE THE AUTHOR DESCRIBES SEVERAL EXPERIMENTS MADE WITH A VIEW TO ASCERTAIN THE PROPORTIONS IN WHICH THE CARBON AND CHLORINE EXIST IN THIS COMPOUND FROM WHICH IT APPEARS THAT AS ONE VOLUME OF OLEFIANT GAS REQUIRES FIVE VOLUMES OF CHLORINE FOR ITS CONVERSION INTO MURIATIC ACID AND THIS NEW CHLORIDE AND AS FOUR VOLUMES OF MURIATIC ACID ARE FORMED SO THREE VOLUMES OF CHLORINE MUST UNITE TO TWO OF CARBON TO FORM THE SOLID CHLORIDE WHEN THIS PERCHLORIDE IS PASSED THROUGH A RED HOT TUBE CHLORINE IS EVOLVED AND A LIQUID COMPOUND OF CARBON AND CHLORINE IS OBTAINED WHICH ASSUMES THE FORM OF A VAPOUR AT 170 AND WHICH LIKE THE FORMER IS INSOLUBLE IN WATER BUT SOLUBLE IN ALCOHOL AND ETHER AND BURNS WITH THE SAME PHENOMENA AS THE SOLID CHLORIDE THE RESULTS OF THE AUTHORS ANALYTICAL EXPERIMENTS UPON THIS FLUID COMPOUND INDUCE HIM TO REGARD IT AS CONSISTING OF ONE PROPORTION OF EACH OF ITS ELEMENTS BY EXPOSING THE VAPOUR OF IODINE AND OLEFIANT GAS TO THE SUNS RAYS MR FARADAY OBTAINED A COLOURLESS CRYSTALLINE COMPOUND DIFFI CULTLY COMBUSTIBLE BUT DECOMPOSABLE AT A HIGH TEMPERATURE OF A SWEET TASTE AND AROMATIC ODOUR AND COMPOSED OF IODINE CARBON AND HYDROGEN HE HAS NOT YET SUCCEEDED IN FORMING A BINARY COM POUND OF CARBON AND IODINE THOUGH HIS EXPERIMENTS LEAVE LITTLE DOUBT OF THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH A COMPOUND AND OF THE POSSIBILITY OF FORMING IT WHEN AIDED BY A BRIGHT SUNSHINE AN ACCOUNT OF THE COMPARISON OF VARIOUS BRITISH STANDARDS OF LINEAR MEASURE BY CAPTAIN HENRY KATER FRS FC READ JANUARY 18 1821 PHIL TRANS 1821 P 75 THE COMMISSIONERS OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES HAVING RECOM MNENDED FOR THE LEGAL DETERMINATION OF THE STANDARD YARD THAT EM PLOYED BY GENERAL ROY IN THE MEASUREMENT OF A BASE ON HOUNSLOW HEATH AS A FOUNDATION FOR THE TRIGONOMETRICAL OPERATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON BY THE ORDNANCE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IT BECAME NECESSARY TO EXAMINE THE STANDARD TO WHICH THE REPORT ALLUDES WITH THE INTENTION OF SUBSEQUENTLY DERIVING FROM IT A SCALE OF FEET AND INCHES THIS STANDARD CONSISTS OF AN IRON BAR 20 FEET LONG DESCRIBED BY CAPTAIN KATER IN WHICH GOLD POINTS ARE INSERTED AT THE DISTANCE OF 40 INCHES FROM EACH OTHER FROM A STANDARD SCALE OF MR RAMSDENS WHICH WAS DECLARED SIMILAR TO THAT OF GENERAL ROY AND ALSO TO THAT OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY BUT ON EXAMINING THESE SCALES CAPTAIN KATER ASCERTAINED THE EXISTENCE OF MATERIAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM AND BEING AWARE OF THE EXISTENCE OF OTHER STANDARDS OF HIGH AUTHORITY HE PROCURED AND COMPARED THEM140 THE AUTHOR THEN DETAILS AT LENGTH THE METHODS BY WHICH HE EFFECTED THESE COMPARISONS AND GIVES TABLES OF THE VARIOUS MEASURE MENTS WHICH ARE AFTERWARDS COMPRISED IN THE FOLLOWING ABSTRACT TAKING COLONEL LAMBTONS STANDARD USED IN THE SURVEY OF INDIA AS THE POINT OF DEPARTURE IN CONSEQUENCE OF ITS BEING THE SHORTEST CAPTAIN KATER FINDS THE EXCESS ON 36 INCHES TO BE AS FOLLOWS SIR GEORGE SHUCKBURGHS STANDARD   000642 BIRDS STANDARD 1760   000659 GENERAL ROYS SCALE   001537 ROYAL SOCIETYS STANDARD   002007 RAMSDENS BAR USED IN THE TRIGONOMETRICAL SURVEY  003147 THE AUTHOR THEN PROCEEDS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF THESE DIFFER ENCES ON THE FIGURE OF THE EARTH AND ARRIVES AT THE CONCLUSION THAT THE COMPARISON GIVEN IN THE ABSTRACT OF COLONEL LAMBTONS PAPER IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS FOR 1818 NAMELY  SHOULD BE SS WHICH AGREES VERY NEARLY WITH THE DEDUCTION OF M LAPLACE FROM THE LUNAR IRREGULARITIES WITH THE RESULT OF DR YOUNGS INVES TIGATION BY A COMPARISON OF THE MEAN WITH THE SUPERFICIAL DENSITY OF THE EARTH AND WITH THE CONJECTURE HAZARDED BY THE AUTHOR FROM THE COMPRESSION GIVEN BY THE EXPERIMENTS ON THE LENGTH OF THE PEN DULUM AT UNST AND PORTSOY AN ACCOUNT OF THE URINARY ORGANS AND URINE OF TWO SPECIES OF THE GENUS RANA BY JOHN DAVY MD FRS READ JANUARY 18 1821 PHIL TRANS 1821 P 95 THE SPECIES OF THE GENUS RANA ADVRERTED TO IN THE TITLE OF THIS PAPER ARE THE RANA TAURINA OR BULL FROG AND THE BUFO FUSCUS OR BROWN TOAD THE KIDNEYS OF THE BULL FROG ARE LOBULATED AND THE URETERS TERMI NATE IN THE RECTUM BETWEEN THE ORIFICE OF THE BLADDER AND THE ANUS THE BLADDER IS LARGE AND ITS ORIFICE WELL CALCULATED TO RECEIVE THE URINE AS IT FLOWS FROM THE URETERS ITS ESCAPE FROM THE RECTUM BEING PREVENTED BY THE SPHINCTER MUSCLE OF THE ANUS IN THE BROWN TOAD THE URETERS HAVE AN ANALOGOUS TERMINATION BUT THE BLADDER WHEN DISTENDED RESEMBLES TWO OVAL BAGS FREELY COMMUNICATING JUST OVER THE SYMPHYSIS PUBIS TO WHICH THEY ARE FIRMLY ATTACHED THE URINE OF THE BULL FROG IS WITHOUT ACTION ON VEGETABLE COLOURS AND CONTAINS UREA WITH TRACES OF SEA SALT AND A LITTLE PHOSPHATE OF LIME THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THIS PAPER WITH SOME REMARKS RELATIVE TO THE DISSIMILARITY OF THE URINE IN ANIMALS WHOSE DIET IS SIMILAR AND CON SIDERS THE NATURE OF THAT SECRETION AS DEPENDING RATHER UPON THE IN TIMATE AND INVISIBLE STRUCTURE OF THE KIDNEY THAN UPON THE KIND OF FOOD WHICH THEY CONSUME THE BROWN TOAD AND THE LIZARD BOTH LIVE UPON FLIES BUT THEIR URINE IS VERY DIFFERENT THE PARROT EATS VEGETABLES ONLY AND THE SNAKE FEEDS EXCLUSIVELY UPON ANIMAL MATTER YET IN THEM THE URINARY SECRETION IS IN ALL MAIN POINTS ALIKE URIC ACID BEING THE PREDOMINANT INGREDIENT IN BOTH

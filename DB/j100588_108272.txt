J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,108272,ON THE ELLIPTIC POLARIZATION OF LIGHT BY REFLEXION FROM METALLIC SURFACES,I207000, 269  X ON THE ELLIPTIC POLARIZATION OF LIGHT BY REFLEXION FROM METALLIC SURFACES BY THE REV BADEN POWELL MA FRS FGS FRAS SAVILIAN PROFESSOR OF GEOMETRY IN THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD RECEIVED APRIL 24READ JUNE 19 1845 IN A FORMER PAPER INSERTED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRIANSACTIONS 1843 PART I I DETAILED OBSERVATIONS ON SOME PHENOMENA OF ELLIPTIC POLARIZATION BY REFLEXION FROM CERTAIN METALLIC SURFACES BUT WITH REFERENCE ONLY TO ONE CLASS OF COMPARATIVE RESULTS FROM THESE I HAVE BEEN LED TO PURSUE THE SUBJECT INTO OTHER RELATIONS BESIDES THOSE AT FIRST CONTEMPLATED BUT FIROM VARIOUS CAUSES HAVE ONLY BEEN ABLE AT THIS INTERVAL TO SUBMIT THE RESULTS TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY AS A SEQUEL TO MY FORMER OBSERVATIONS THE CHANGES IN THE DEGREE OF ELLIPTICITY INVESTIGATED IN MY FORMER PAPER CORRE SPOND TO CERTAIN CHANGES IN THE THICKNESS OF METALLIC FLMS IF WE NOW CONSIDER THE CASE OF REFLEXION FROM A SIMPLE POLISHED METALLIC SURFACE AND ADMIT THAT IN THIS CASE IT MAY BE SUPPOSED TO TAKE PLACE BY THE PENETRATION OF THE RAY TO A CERTAIN MINUTE DEPTH OR TO SOME ACTION OF A THIN TRANSPARENT LAMINA OF THE METAL THEN IN LIKE MANNERDEPENDENT ON THE LAW OF METALLIC RETARDATIONTHE EFFECT WOULD VARY WITH A DIFFERENCE IN THE EFFECTIVE THICKNESS OF THE LAMINA PRODUCED BY CHANGING THE INCLI NATION OF THE INCIDENT RAY AND THAT THIS IS THE CASE IN GENERAL IS WELL KNOWN VIZ THAT AS THE INCIDENCE IS INCREASED THE ELLIPTICITY INCREASES UP TO A MAXIMUM WHICH OCCURS FOR MOST METALS AT AN INCIDENCE BETWEEN 700 AND 80 BEYOND WHICH IT DECREASES UP TO 90 THE ORIGINAL RESEARCHES OF SIR D BREWSTER TO WHICH WE ARE INDEBTED FOR THE FIRST INVESTIGATION OF THESE PHENOMENA AFFORD A STRIKING INSTANCE OF THE LEGITIMATE PROCESS OF INDUCTIVE INQUIRY IN ITS FIRST STAGE IN THEIR TOTAL EXEMPTION FROM ALL REFER ENCE TO ANY PHYSICAL THEORY IN THESE RESEARCHES BESIDES THE CHANGE IN ELLIPTICITY WITH THE INCIDENCE THERE IS ALSO INCLUDED THE CHANGE IN THE VIRTUAL PLANE OF POLARIZA TION BY METALLIC REFLEXION WHICH THOUGH CONJECTURED TO BE THE SAME AS THAT INVES TIGATED BY FRESNEL FOR TRANSPARENT SUBSTANCEST WAS ONLY EXAMINED IN DETAIL AT INCIDENCES AT OR NEAR THAT FOR THE MAXIMUM ELLIPTICITY TO WHICH THE AUTHORS OBJECT IMMEDIATELY RESTRICTED HIM BUT FOR A SERIES OF METALS CONSTANT ARCS WERE ACCURATELY DETERMINED WHICH ARE THE AZIMUTHS OF POLARIZATION OF THE RAY RESTORED TO PLANE POLARIZATION AFTER TWO REFLEXIONS FROM METAL PLATES AT THE INCIDENCE FOR THE MAXIMUM WHILE THE ELLIPSE FROM WHICH THE APPELLATION OF  ELLIPTIC POLARIZATION WAS DERIVED IS A PURELY EMNPIRICAL REPRESENTATION OF THE VARYING ARCS OF INCIDENCE CONSIDERED AS  PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 1830 PART II T IBID P 292  IBID P 294 2N2270 PROFESSOR POWELL ON THE ELLIPTIC POLARIZATION OF LIGHT RADII FOR THE SECOND REFLEXION TO RESTORE PLANE POLARIZATION AT ALL AZIMUTHS OF THE PLANE OF SECOND REFLEXION TO THE FIRST THOUGH THE SUBJECT OF METALLIC REFLEXION IS STILL IN A CONDITION OF GREAT OBSCURITY AS TO THE MECHANICAL CAUSES TO WHICH ITS PECULIAR CHARACTER IS REFERRIBLE YET THE APPLICA TION OF THE UNDULATORY THEORY AT LEAST ENABLES US TO TRACE AND CONNECT SOME OF ITS LAWS AND IN THE ATTEMPT TO PURSUE SUCH AN APPLICATION TO SOME FURTHER RELATIONS THE NATURE OF MY RESEARCHES MAY BE BRIEFLY EXPLAINED AS FOLLOWS 1 SO FAR AS THE OBJECTS OF MY FORMER INQUIRY WERE CONCERNED IT SUFFICED TO TAKE THEFORMULA THERE EMPLOYED FOR THE POLARIZED RINGS IN THE SIMPLIFIED FORM RESULTING FROM SUPPOSING A COMMON COEFFICIENT TO THE TWO COMPONENT VIBRATIONS THE PLANE OF ORIGINAL POLARIZATION INCLINED 450 TO THAT OF REFLEXION AND 90 TO THAT OF ANALYZATION WITH REFERENCE HOWEVER TO SOME OF THE FACTS CONNECTED WITH OBSERVATIONS AT DIFFERENT INCIDENCES AND AZIMUTHS OF THE POLARIZER AS WELL AS ON OTHER GROUNDS IT SEEMED DESIRABLE TO GENERALIZE THAT FORMULA BY REMOVING THE ABOVEMENTIONED RESTRICTIONS AND I HAVE ACCORDINGLY HERE GIVEN AN EXPRESSION FOR THE RINGS IN ELLIPTIC LIGHT OF ALL DEGREES WITH GENERIAL COEFFICIENTS AND FOR ALL POSITIONS OF THE POLALIZER AND ANALYZER WHICH THOUGH WITHOUT DIFFICULTY DEDUCIBLE HAS NOT AS FAR AS I AM AWARE BEEN STATED BY ANY WRITER 2 WITH RESPECT TO THE GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE RINGS THE SLIGHTEST OBSERVATION SHOWS THAT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE DARK AND BRIGHT CENTRED SYSTEMS IN PLANE POLARIZED LIGHT THOUGLH MODJFIED IS NOT LOST IN THE LOWER DEGREES OF ELLIPTICITY  IT DIS APPEARS ONLY WHEN THE LIGHT BECOMES PERFECTLY CIRCULAR WHEN THE DISTINCTION IS ONLY SEEN IN THE CHANGED DIRECTION OF DISLOCATION WHEN THE PLANE OF ANALYZATION IS INCLINED 45 BETWEEN THE RECTANGULAR DIRECTIONS AND GENERALLY IN INTERMEDIATE POSITIONS THE WHOLE APPEARANCE IS AS IT WERE DISTORTED THE DARK ARCS NEAREST THE CENTRE ARE SITUATED TOWARDS ONE END OF THE QUADRANTS INSTEAD OF BEING IN THE MIDDLE AND IN THE SUCCEEDING RINGS THOUGH LESS STRONGLY MARKED THERE IS AN APPARENT INCREASE OF INTENSITY TOWARDS THE SAMNE END OF THE QUA DRANT OWING TO A GENERAL SHADE OF DARKNESS IN THE GROUND TOWARDS THAT SIDE OF THIS APPEARANCE THOUGH IT MUST HAVE BEEN CONSTANTLY SEEN AS FAR AS I KNOW NO EX PLANATION HAS BEEN PUBLISHED IN CIRCULAR POLARIZATION IT DOES NOT OCCUR IN PLANE POLARIZED RINGS THE ANALOGOUS CASE IS THAT OF THE WELLKNOWN SYSTEM OF EIGHT DISLOCATED SECTORS WHICH IN ELLIPTICITY OF LOWER DEGREES IS COMBINED WITH AND PASSES INTO THAT JUST DESCRIBED ALL THIS IS EXPRESSED BY MY FORMULA 3 THE RESTORATION OF ELLIPTIC TO PLANE POLARIZED LIGHT BY MEANS OF FRESNELS RHOMB AND THE DETERMINATION OF THE ELLIPTICITY BY THE AZIMUTH OF THE RHOMB THOUGH AN OBVIOUS PROCESS YET HAS NOT AS FAR AS I KNOW BEEN PURSUED FOR ANY SERIES OF METALS SUCH A SET OF OBSERVATIONS I HAVE ACCORDINGLY MADE AT THE INCIDENCE FOR THE MAXIMUM ELLIPTICITY FOR A CONSIDERABLE RANGE OF METALS SOME METALLIC ORES AND OTHER REFLECTING SUBSTANCES ALSO IN A FEW PRINCIPAL CASES I HAVE MADE SIMILAR OBSERVATIONS AT OTHER INCIDENCES FROM 80 UP TO 30 AT WHICH THE ELLIPTICITY DISAPPEARS  SEE PLATE II FIG 3I I77R RWALICC X LV L A  7O A 3 F 13 TF   XXR XX XX  JPMI2A E BI     IBY REFLEXION FROM METALLIC SURFACES 4 IN THESE CASES THE METALLIC REFLEXION PERFORMS THE PART OF THE FIRST RHOMB IN FRESNELS EXPERIMENT WITH TWO IF I RIGHTLY INTERPRET SIR D BREWSTERS PROCESS FOR A SIMILAR RESTORATION BEFORE REFERRED TO AND IF THE TWO METAL PLATES ARE ANALOGOUS TO THE TWO RLHOMNBS IN THE CHANGE OF PLANE WHICH HE SO ACCURATELY DETERMINED AFTER THE SECOND REFLEXION AT THE MAXIMUM INCIDENCE WE MAY INFER A CORRESPONDENCE WITH THAT PRODUCED IN THE RHOMB AND THAT IT IS EQUAL TO TWICE THE AZIMUTH OF THE RHOMB AND IN FACT I FIND THE RESULTS FROM TWO SUCH DIFFERENT METHODS AGREE VERY CLOSELY FOR ALL THE PURE METALS THOUGH FOR CERTAIN ORES VERY LOW IN THE SCALE THERE ARE SOME DISCREPANCIES THERE IS ALSO A CLOSE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THESE RESULTS AND THE AZIMUTHS OF THE PLANE OF THE RAY RESTORED TO PLANE POLARIZATION BY THE ACTION OF A CRYSTALLIZED PLATE AS GIVEN BY THE SAMLE AUTHOR FOR SOME OF THE PRINCIPAL METALS WHICH CONFIRMS THE SAME INFERENCE 5 THE CHANGES OF PLANE FOR SUCCESSIVE INCIDENCES ARE IN GENERAL OF A NATURE ANALO GOUS TO THOSE IN THE REFLEXION FROM TRANSPARENT BODIES BUT NOT THE SAME AT THE INCIDENCE FOR THE MAXIMUM IF THE PLANE OF THE POLARIZER BE FIRST ADJUSTED TO GIVE E G THE DARK SYSTEM THEN ON CHANGING ITS PLANE TO 450 THE ANALYZER IN ORDER TO RESTOLE WHAT IS ANALOGOUS TO THE SAME THAT IS THE DARKEST SYSTEM MUST COINCIDE WITH THE PLANE OF INCIDENCE OR IS AZIMUTH IS  IN EXACT AGREEMENT WITH WHAT OBTAINS BOTH BY THEORY AND OBSERVATION IN THE REFLEXION FROM TRANSPARENT BODIES AT GREATER INCIDENCES TO RESTORE THE SAME SYSTEM THE ANALYZER MUST BE MOVED THROUGH INCREASING ARCS ON ONE SIDE OF THE PLANE OF INCIDENCE AND AT LESSER INCIDENCES ON THE OTHER AS FOR TRANSPARENT BODIES FOLLOWING UP THESE LATTER AS THE INCIDENCE IS SUCCESSIVELY DIMINISHED THE AZINUTH OF THE ANALYZER CHANGES IN A MANNER OBVIOUSLY ENT FROM THAT ATWHICH OBTAINS FOR TRANSPARENT BODIES THOUGH OF THE SAME GENERAL CHARACTER AND THE INCREASE IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT METALS BUT IN ALL N CASES IT APPROACHES 450 AS THE INCI DENCE APPROACHES THE PERPENDICULAR IN THESE CASES THE AZIMUTH OF THE POLARIZER REMAINS AT 45 IF IT BE CHANGED THAT OF THE ANALYZER PRESERVES A CONSTANT RELATION THOUGH THESE OBSERVATIONS ARE OF AN OBVIOUS NATURE YET AS FAR AS I KNOW NONE OF THE KIND HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED FOR ANY SERIES OF NETALS I HAVE ACCORDINGLY GIVEN SUCH A SET FOR VARIOUS REFLECTING SUBSTANCES BUT THOUGH APPARENTLY SIMPLE IN PRNCIPLE THSE PROCESS IS TROUBLESOME IN PRACTICE AND AFFECTED BY VARIOUS CAUSES OF UNCERTAINTY AND DIFFICULTY SOME APPARENT ANOMA LIES ESPECIALLY WHICH CAUSED THE ARCS AT SMALL INCIDENCES TO APPEAR TO INCREASE BEYOND 45 FOR A LONG TIME CAUSED ME MUCH PERPLEXITY THE RESULTS HOWEVER HERE OFFERED HAVING BEEN OBTAINED WITH THE USE OF EVERY PRE CAUTION AND BEING THE MEANS OF A GREAT NUMBER OF REPETITIONS I TRUST ON THE WHOLE MAY NOT BE USELESS AS A FIRST ATTEMPT TO DETERMINE THESE CHANGES BY DIRECT OBSERVATION 6 THE ELLIPTICITY AT DIFFERENT INCIDENCES CANNOT BE DEDUCED EXCEPT AT THE MAX  PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 1830 PART II P 311 271272 PROFESSOR POWELIJ ON THE ELIIPTIIC POLARIZATION OF LIGHT IMUM FROM THE RHOMB OBSERVATIONS WITHOUT A KNOWLEDGE OF THE CHANGE OF PLANE EMPLOYING THESE LATTER DATA IN COMBINATION WITH THE FORMER 3 I HAVE FURTHER ESTIMATED THE ELLIPTICITY AT DIFFERENT INCIDENCES FOR FOUR PRINCIPAL METALS 7 FOR THE APPLICATION OF THE UNDULATORY THEORY TO THESE PHENOMENA WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO ASSIGN THE LAW OF METALLIC RETARDATION BUT THIS HAS NOT YET BEEN DONE THE THEORY AS HERE GIVEN INDICATES THE CONDITIONS OF THE MAXIMUM AND SHOWS IN GENERAL A CHANGE BUT NOT ITS AMOUNT PROFESSOR MACCULLAGH HAS HOWEVER PROPOSED IN ACCORDANCE WITH A REMARKABLE MATHEMATICAL ANALOGY CERTAIN MODIFICATIONS OF FRESNELS FORMULA WHICH HE HAS REDUCED TO CALCULATION IN THE CASE OF STEEL MY THEORETICAL FORMULA GIVES RISE TO AN EXPRESSION FOR THE CHANGE OF PLANE BUT IN VOLVING UNDETERMINED FUNCTIONS OF THE RETARDATION ON DEDUCING THE CORRESPONDING TERMS FROM PROFESSOR MACCULLAGHS DATA AND INTRODUCING THEM INTO MY FORMULA I FND IT GIVES A VERY CLOSE REPRESENTATION OF THE OBSERVED RESULTSFOR STEEL THUS PROFESSOR MACCULLAGHS EMPIRICAL EXPRESSION RECEIVES AN ADDITIONAL CONFIRMNATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH A DIRECT DEDUCTION FIOM THE UNDULATORY THEORY

THE INTERVENTION OF THE RINGS INSTEAD OF USING THE SIMPLE ANA LYZER AFFORDS SOME AID IN THIS RESPECT SINCE THE CHANGE IN THE NATURE AND FORM OF THE RINGS OFFERS A MORE READY GUIDE TO THE EYE

HAVE OBTAINED SOME ADDITIONAL IN STANCES OF ELLIPTIC POLARIZATION WHICH MAY BE NOT UNINTERESTING IN CONNEXION WITH THOSE THEREIN MENTIONED BESIDES PLUMBAGO IN WHICH THE PROPORTION OF METAL PRESENT IS AT LEAST VERY VARI ABLE AND SMALL I HAVE NOW OBSERVED A SLIGHT BUT QUITE UNEQUIVOCAL ELLIPTICITY IN THE REFLEXION FROM CHINA INK WHICH IS WHOLLY NONMETALLIC IT IS AT ITS MAXIMUNI AT AN INCIDENCE OF 62 AND ITS AZIMUTH OF RESTORATION BY THE RHOMB IS ABOUT 5 I HAVE EXAMINED ALSO CHROMATE OF LEAD WHICH GIVES VERY SMALL ELLIPTICITY WHICH IS AT A MAXIMUM AT AN INCIDENCE OF 70 AGREEING WELL WITH THE MEAN REFRACTIVE INDEX AND THE AZIMNUTH OF THE HORRB IS ABOUT 6

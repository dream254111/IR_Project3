j100079,Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research,1354801,A Greek Synagogue Inscription from Jerusalem,i258558,are new mosaic inscriptions of interest but most important is an almost complete zodiac with the Hebrew names of the signs such as aryeLeo bethaldh  Virgo and mozndyim  Libra sartdn  Cancer Later iconoclasm has mutilated the figures as iii the Galilean synagogues but enough is left to furnish material for a most interesting chapter in the history of Jewish culture It may be added that the building is architecturally inferior and the superstructure is made of brick instead of stone In the middle of April the British under the direction of Garstang and PhythianAdams resumed work at Ascalon So far attention has been devoted partly to the Byzantine theater around the supposed Pool of Peace or Pool of Health and partly to the area at the edge of the old mound where perpendicular cuttings brought Philistine pottery to light last fall The intention of the excavators is to take a certain area and peel the debris off stratum by stratum Already in some places the Philistine layer has been passed and pottery from the first half of the second millennium has been found Unquestionably important revelations may soon be expected from the old Philistine seaport A GREEK SYNAGOGUE INSCRIPTION FROM JERUSALEM The chief prize of oriental archaology is inscriptions and as these have been comparatively rare in Palestine their occurrence in that field evokes great interest In BULLETIN No 2 we presented the synagogue inscription from Ain Duq near Jericho and Director Albright reports that in the same neighborhood other inscriptions and mosaics of value have been discovered by the Dominican Fathers Of particular interest is a Greek inscription which was found by Captain Weill in his excavations 19131914 on the Ophel the southern end of the eastern hill of Jerusalem the site of the oldest city For these excavations see the explorers work La Cite de David P Geuthner Paris It is only since the War that this inscription has been made public Our frontispiece gives a facsimile of the inscription Its translation is as follows Theodotos son of Vettenos priest and synagogue chief son of a synagogue chief grandson of a synagogue chief constructed the synagogue for the reading of the law and the teaching of the Commandments i e the Law and the Mishnal and also its chambers and water arrangements for a hostelry for those coming from abroad who have need of them which synagogue was built by his fathers and the elders and Simonides Many suggestions and problems arise in the interpretation of this text The father of the donor bears a Latin name and was probably a freedman of the family Vettius Who Simonides was we do not learn Theodotos was the Greek rendering of the Hebrew Nathaniel or a like name The donor himself was of priestly and archisynagogal rank by inheritance and it appears that he had an inherited interest in the structure We might weave a romance of the freedmans son coming back a rich man to the city of his fathersCicero has a good deal to say of a banker of his day one Vettienusand taking an interest in the pious work of his ancestors repairing it and perhaps adding the waterworks The light thrown on the menage of a synagogue in ancient Jerusalem is most valuable but of special interest is the combination that at once comes to mind with the Synagogue of the Libertines i e Freedmen referred to in Acts 6 8 whose members were among those who opposed St Stephen 13The donor belonged by birth to that class and his intention in the estab lishment was for people from foreign parts so that a most plausible iden tification may be assumed There remains the question of the date While it has been argued that the inscription may belong to the age of Trajan when the Jews were trying to reestablish residence in Jerusalem it is much more likely that the building operations referred to belong to the period before the destruction of the city A D 70 The inscription would then be contemporaneous to the scenes and writings of the New Testament The inscription has called forth several learned monographs namely by

ASKELON The excavation of Askelon by Professor Garstang under the auspices of the Palestine Exploration Fund is going steadily forward Late in June the excavators uncovered so the Quarterly Statement of the Palestine Exploration Fund announces the famous colonnade around the great court which was built by Herod the Great Josephus describes the wonderful workmanship of this cloister It was only one of the splendid structures built by that king Statues of Apollo Venus and a giant statue of Herod himself were also found The information reached London by telegraph just in time for the annual meeting of the Fund Further and fuller infor mation will be awaited with great interest AN INTERESTING ARCHAEOLOGICAL COLLECTION Professor Max L Kellner of the Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge Massachusetts is the fortunate possessor of a valuable col lection of flints pottery and glass from Syria and Palestine which deserves to be much more widely known than it is The collection was made in 191314 Some of it was discovered in caves of the stone age near the Dog River seven miles north of Beirut which Professor Kellner and Dr Arthur Peabody of Harvard explored and some of it represents purchases and surface finds made in or near Jerusalem The flints are from both the Old Stone Age and the Later Stone Age and include many interesting forms Of especial interest is an axe from the Old Stone Age which was picked up by Professor Kellner on Mount Scopus just north of the Mount of Olives near Jerusalem It may have been used by the cave dwellers who more than five thousand years ago formed the first settlement about the Ain Sitti Miriam the Biblical Gihon whose habitations were discovered by Parker in 190911 It had lain on Scopus through all the varied history of Jerusalem The pottery sixty odd pieces consists of wellpreserved specimens from the Amorite Canaanite and Hebrew periods The glass forty odd pieces is made up of excellent examples of the principal varieties of glass objects found in tombs of the Greek and Roman periods Most of the objects are perfect of their kind and some of them are rare Especially beautiful is a claretcolored glass jar ornamented with threads of glass in relief and a glass flask also claret colored moulded in the form of a cluster of grapes The collection is mentioned here because it represents so well 14BULLETIN OF

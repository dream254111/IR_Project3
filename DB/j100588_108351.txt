of Spirits of different Specifie Gravities By GEORGE FOWNES Esq FRS Professor of Practical Chemistry in University College London Received June 7Read June 17 1847 HAVING been for some months past occupied with experimients on the fermenta tion of sugar and molasses and having found it necessary to construct for this pur pose a new table of the quantity per centum by weight of absolute alcohol contained in spirits of different specific gravities I venture to lay the same before the Royal Society hoping that it may be found generally useful in inquiries of this kind and also for other purposes The Table was formed synthetically absolute alcohol and distilled water were weighed out in the required proportions mixed in small wellstopped bottles and wellshaken together After standing three or four days the mixtures were brought to the temperature of 60 FAHR exactly and their specific gravities determined with great care After the lapse of two or three days more this lastnamed operation was repeated but in no case was it observed that any further contlaction had oc curred Neither was the specific gravity of a mixture containing nearly equal parts alcohol and water which had been so examined changed by being inclosed in a strong accuratelystoppered bottle and heated for some timne to a temperature above its boilingpoint In this manner each alternate number in the Table each even nunmber was ob tained by direct experiment the others were then interpolated When completed the Table was examined by various methods calculated to test its accuracy but no error of sufficient magnitude to limit its usefulness was detected The absolute alcohol employed in these experimnents was prepared in the following mannerthe strongest rectified spirit was agitated with half its weight of carbonate of potash deprived of water of crystallization and left in contact with the salt some days It was then decanted upon half its weight of powdered quicklime made from black marble contained in a metal still which could be perfectly closed The mix ture of spirit and lime was retained in a warm situation for a week or thlereabouts and then distilled by means of a waterbath By this treatment the specific gravity of the alcohol was generally reduced to 796 or even below and by a repetition of the process of digestion with powdered lime and redistillation the last traces of water were removed In this manner without difficulty the very considerable quantity of absolute alcohol required for the experiments was procured MDCCCXLVII 2 KMR FOWNES ON THE VALUE IN ABSOLUTE ALCOHOL Absolute alcohol thus obtained has the specific gravity 7938 at 600 FAHR it is extremely expansible by heat which renders the determination of its exact specific gravity difficult and troublesome when the temperature of the room is either above or below 60 The same remark applies to the mixtures of alcohol and water ex tending over more than half the Table the most minute precautions regarding tem perature being necessary to avoid serious errors In a glass retort containing pieces of copperfoil absolute alcohol boils at 177 FAHR the barometer standing at 2975 inches Lastly when analysed by combustion with oxide of copper it yields numbers representing the proportions of carbon and hydrogenpresent so closely agreeing with those required by theory as to leave no doubt of its purity and freedom from all ad mixture The contraction of volume suffered by various mixtures of alcohol and water may be rendered obvious by comparing the actual specific gravities of such mixtures with the calculated mean specific gravities In the accompanying Plate XIII in which the vertical lines represent the percentage of alcohol by weight and the horizontal lines the specific gravities the calculated mean specific gravities of the mixtures are seen to form a straight diagonal line from corner to corner while the actual specific gravities form an irregular curve with upward convexity rising quickly to near its maximum deviation at 30 per cent running nearly parallel with the other line to 50 per cent and thence declining until it reaches the extremity of the scale

j101009,The Virginia Law Register,1097981,Maias Admr v Eastern State Hospital Supreme Court of Appeals At Richmond November 16 1899,i245866,to him the decree must be reversed and this court will enter such de cree as the Circuit Court ought to have entered Reversed NOTEIt is elementary learning that in the absence of statute a receiver is but an officer of the court with no other powers than those which the court sees fit to confer upon him He has no authority merely by virtue of his office to institute suits on behalf of the fund which he represents This rule is based on the salutary principle that it is for the court itself to determine whether it shall be a litigant in a suit which may result in a waste of the funds which are being administered through the medium of the receiver Hence the established rule of practice that when a receiver sues at law or in equity he must in general allege and prove his authoiity to do so from the court by which he was appointed There was probably no controversy over this rule in the prin cipal case but over the question whether authority to the receiver  to collect the debts mentioned did not carry with it by implication the requisite authority to collect by suit This as the court holds depends upon the circumstances of each case The rule requiring the consent of the court in order to authorize a suit by a re ceiver applies with equal force to suits against him A failure to obtain the courts consent before instituting suit against its receiver may not only be treated as a contempt but the omission is generally held to be jurisdictional

EASTERN STATE HOSPITALPublic corporationsPersonal injuryNegligence of managers and servants The Eastern State Hospital is a public corporation governed and controlled by the State and acts exclusively as an agent of the State for the protection of society and the promotion of the best interests of a class of unfortunate citizens Although under the terms of its charter it  Reported by M P Burks State Reporter 534 Dec VIRGINIA LAW REGISTERMAIA V EASTERN STATE HOSPITAL may sue and be sued regard must be had to the objects for which it was established in order to determine its liability It is not liable in damages for a personal injury inflicted on one of its inmates in consequence of the negli gence or misconduct of the persons administering the powers of the corpora tion or their agents or employees Eastern Lunatic Asylum v Garrett 27 Gratt 163 distinguished Error to a judgment of the Circuit Court of the city of Richmond rendered December 7 1897 in an action of trespass on the case wherein the plaintiff in error was the plaintiff and the defendant in error was the defendant Affirmed The opinion states the case Samuel D Davies and R E Frayser for the plaintiff in error AttorneyGeneral A J Montague and Wm R Aylett for the de fendant in error BUCHANAN J delivered the opinion of the court This cause was heard at a former term of the court and an opinion and judgment rendered reversing the judgment complained of Upon a petition to rehear that judgment was set aside and at this term of the court the cause was again argued and submitted The plaintiff in error who was the plaintiff in the court below brought an action of trespass on the case to recover damages for the death of his intestate alleged to have been caused by the negligence of the defendant or its agents in requiring and permitting the intestate whilst a patient and inmate of the defendants hospital for the insane to dig and excavate in the side of an embankment the property of the defendant without providing props or supports to prevent the over hanging earth from falling upon him The defendant demurred to the declaration and to each count thereof upon the ground that it was a public corporationan agency of the Statefor the exercise of purely governmental unctions and that no action would lie against it for the injury complained of The first question to be considered is the character of the defendant corporation Is the defendant a public corporationan agency of the State exercising exclusively governmental functions  By an act of the House of Burgesses passed in the year 1769 after a preamble reciting that persons of insane or disordered minds had been frequently found wandering in different parts of the colony and 1899 535VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER no certain provision has been yet made either towards effecting a cure of those whose cases are not become quite desperate nor for restrain ing others who might be dangerous to society fifteen persons among them John Blair Peyton Randolph and George Wythe were  constituted trustees for founding and establishing a public hospital for the reception of such persons as from time to time according to the rules and orders established by this act may be sent thereto And the said trustees shall be called and known by the name and style of the court of di rectors of the public hospital for persons of insane or disordered minds 8 Hennings Statutes p 378 By an act of the General Assembly passed in 1785 the directors of the public hospital which had been organized and conducted under the act of 1769 and amendments thereto was created a corporation 12 Hen Statutes 198 and has ever since existed as a corporation under variohs names and is now known as The Eastern State Hospital See Code of 1819 ch 109 Code of 1849 ch 85 Code of 1887 ch 75 Acts of 18934 p 397 An examination of the statutes creating and continuing this hospital shows that it was created and exists for purely governmental purposes and is under the exclusive ownership and control of the State It has no stockholders no members even except directors having no interest in it or its affairs who are appointed by the Governor by and with the consent of the Senate and are in fact public rather than corporate officials endowed with a corporate being for a more convenient admin istration of the duties imposed upon them by law and are made liable to fines for any failure to perform their duties The moneys necessary to defray the expenses of maintaining and caring for its inmates is provided by annual appropriations made by the General Assembly out of the public treasury and the manner of keeping and disbursing its funds is prescribed by statute The direct ors are required to make quarterly reports to the Auditor of Public Accounts showing in detail how they have been disbursed and to re port annually to the Governor for the information of the General As sembly the condition of the hospital and the sums received and dis bursed by them It is plain under the authorities and especially under the recent case of Phillips v University of Virginia 1 Va Sup Rep 553 5 Va Law Reg 466 that the defendant is a public corporation governed and controlled by the State and acts exclusively as an agency of the State for the protection of society and for the promotion of the best 536 DecMAIA V EASTERN STATE HOSPITAL interests of the unfortunate people of the commonwealth of insane or disordered minds The next question is whether the defendant a public corporation an agency of the State exercising exclusively governmental functions is liable for the injuries complained of in the declaration In the case of City of Richmond v Long 17 Gratt 375 the liability of a municipal corporation for the negligence of its agents when in the exercise and performance of governmental powers and duties was con sidered That was an action to recover damages for the loss of a slave who it was alleged had lost his life by reason of the careless and neg ligent conduct of the agents of the city in permitting him to escape whilst insane from the smallpox hospital of the city into which he had been admitted for treatment in pursuance of the ordinance of the city In that case the distinction was drawn between powers and du ties which are granted to or imposed upon a public body as an agency of government to be exercised and performed exclusively for public governmental purposes and those powers and privileges which are exercised by the corporation or body for its own private advantage and are for public purposes in no other sense than that the public de rives a common benefit from a proper discharge of the duties arising from the grant For the negligent exercise or performance of the former class of powers and duties it was held that the city was not liable and as the injury complained of belonged to that class it was held that the action would not lie Whilst it was admitted that if the injury had resulted from negligence in the exercise or performance of the latter class of powers and duties the city would have been liable in the same manner as an individual or private corporation The doctrine enunciated in that case was recognized and the case cited with approval in De Voss v City of Richmond 18 Gratt 344 City of Petersburg v Applegarths Admr 28 Gratt 3434 Noble c v City of Richmond 31 Gratt 278 Orme v City of Richmond 79 Va 89 and in the very recent case of Terry v City of Richmond 94 Va 537 5445 the distinction was again recognized and acted upon If a municipal corporation which has a twofold character one pub lic and the other private is exempt from liability for the negligence of its agents when in the exercise and performance of its powers and duties as an agency of the government a public corporation which was created and exists for no other than governmental purposes must necessarily be exempt from such liability Otherwise there would be 1899 537VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER this anomaly that for such negligence a corporation created partly for governmental purposes would be exempt from liability whilst one cre ated wholly for such purposes would not be when the reason for such exemption is solely because it was in the exercise of governmental functions when the negligence occurred But we are not left to deter mine this question upon reason merely We have authority upon the subject In the case of Sayre v Northwest Turnpike Road Co 10 Leigh 454 which was an action of trespass on the case to recover damages for the washing away of the plaintiffs saw and grist mills and milldam caused by the alleged negligent planning and construction of a bridge by the defendant corporation over the stream upon which th y were built it was held that the action would not lie because the dfendant corporation was composed in the language of President Tucker who delivered the unanimous opinion of the court exclusively of officers of the government having no personal interest in it or in its concerns and only acting as the organ of the Commonwealth in effecting a great public improvement This conclusion is fully sustained we think by the weight of authority See iVNgent v Commissioners 58 Miss 197 Hughes v County of Monzroe 147 N Y 49 39 L R A 33 De Vere Ford v School District Pa 1 L R A 607 Iowa State Ass Soc v Jordan 24 L R A 655 Cooley on Torts 2 Ed p 738 to 743 1 Shear  Red on Neg 5 Ed sees 260a 295 and 319 It is insisted by the plaintiffs counsel that the defendant is made a corporation by the express language of the Code sec 1661 and as there is no qualification or restriction respecting its character as a cor poration it must be deemed in all respects a corporation under the general law with the liability to be sued in like manner as any other corporation that this was expressly so held in the case of the same corporation under its then corporate name of Eastern Lunatic Asylum in Eastern Lunatic Asylum v Garrett 37 Gratt 163 174 and that that decision is conclusive of the plaintiffs right to maintain this action It is true that it is expressly provided by the section of the Code cited that the defendant may sue and be sued that this court did sus tain an action of trover against it and that Judge Staples in deliver ing the opinion of the court did say that the asylum is a corpora tion and as such may be sued in tresnass or trover  but it does not necessarily follow that because the act incorporating a public corpora 538 DecMAIA V EASTERN STATE HOSPITAL tion provides that it may be sued and that this court has held that an action of tort would lie against it that it can be sued in all cases of tort in which a private corporation may be sued If that contention were true a municipal corporation whose charter provided that it might sue and be sued would be liable in all cases of tort like a pri vate corporation yet notwithstanding such provision in its charter we know that an action will not lie against it for the negligence of its officers or agents when exercising its governmental functions By the terms of most if not all acts of incorporation whether for public or private purposes it is provided that they may sue and be sued The reason for such legislation and the construction such language should re ceive is considered and commented on by Judge Allen in Dunnington v Northwest Turnpike Road 6 Gratt 160 170 In that case as in the Garrett case the point was made that the action would not lie against the defendant because it was a public corporation acting as an agency of the State That was an action of assumpsit for work and labor done and materials furnished and the court held that the action would lie and in distinguishing that case from the case of Sayre v North west Turnpike Road Co supra Judge Allen said  The question really is not whether any action will lie against this company but whether having regard to the objects of the corporation the action will lie for the particular grievance complained of It was not decided in the case of Sayre v N W Turnpike Road 10 Leigh 454 that no action will lie against this corporation all that the case decided was that the ac tion would not lie against this company for the injury there complained of Applying the principle laid down in that case that in order to determine whether an action will lie against a public corporation like this for the grievance complained of regard must be had to the objects for which the corporation was created there is no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that the decision in the Garrett case is not in conflict with the Sayre case and that the court did not intend to overrule it by an opinion which makes no reference to it and does not discuss or even refer to it or the questions involved in it That was a wholly different case from this There is no similarity between the two except both were actions of tort During the civil war the military forces of the United States took possession of Williamsburg where the defendant asylum was and is located and held it until the end of the war Upon their approach to the city the authorities in charge of the asylum left it and did not return In January 1865 the Federal officer who was in command 1899 539VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER there sent out a party some miles into the country and took by force from the farm of the plaintiff who had left his home corn and bacon which was sent to the asylum and used for the support of the inmates After the war the plaintiff brought an action of trover against the asy lum to recover the value of the articles taken and used It was held in that case 1st that by the laws of war property could not be taken without compensation for the purpose of feeding the inmates of the asylum 2d that the property having been taken without lawful au thority the plaintiffs title to it was not divested and it having been applied to the defendants use he could recover its value from the asylum in an action of trover Although the action in that case was in tort it could as well have been in assumpsit 3 Rob Pr New 399 It was to recover the value of property which the defendant had the right to purchase for the maintenance of those entrusted to its care and pay for out of the appropriation made for that purpose by the State and the plaintiffs property having been converted to the use of the corporation for the same purposes for which it had authority to purchase it it ought to have paid for it and the court very properly held that an action would lie to compel it to do so The directors in this case clearly had no right to pay damages for the grievance complained of out of any funds under their control Those funds were appropriated by the State to pay the expenses of caring for and maintaining the inmates of the hospital and not for paying damages resulting from the negligent management of those in charge of it If such damages were chargeable on the funds or pro perty under the control of the directors their payment might prevent the accomplishment of the very object for which the money was ap propriated The taxpayers might thus become insurers against the negligence of public officials instead of being contributors for the sup port and maintenance of a great public charity That an unfortunate inmate of the hospital should suffer from the negligence or misconduct of the persons administering the powers of the corporation or their agents or employees is indeed a hardship but we do not think that this hardship should be remedied by giving damages to such an one or his representatives at the expense of the other inmates of the hospital or of the tax payers of the State For such negligence he should be left to his remedy against those by whose negligence he was injured and whose liability for their own acts of negligence must be determined by the rules of law applicable to such cases 540 DecMAIA V EASTERN STATE HOSPITAL It seemed to be conceded in argument that if the plaintiff could maintain his action and obtain judgment against the defendant he could not subject its buildings and grounds or other property to the satisfac tion of the judgment but would have to look to the legislature for payment If this be so as we think it is it shows that this action will not lie against the defendant for if the plaintiff has no right to com pel the defendant to compensate him for the grievance complained of it is clear that he has no cause of action against it for as was said by Lord Holt in White v Ashby 1 Lead Cas 464 483 It is a vain thing to imagine a right without a remedy for want of right and want of remedy are reciprocal To make out a cause of action against a defendant the plaintiffs legal rights must have been violated and the defendant must be answerable therefor Pomeroys Remedies and Remedial Rights sec 619 Cooley on Torts 2 ed 20 The courts of this State have no jurisdiction to ascertain and fix the damages for injuries which the plaintiff may have suffered in a case where the de fendant is not liable in order that the plaintiff may present his claim to the legislature for payment We are of opinion that the demurrer to the declaration was properly sustained and that the judgment of the Circuit Court should be affirmed HARRISON J dissenting I am unable to concur in the decision pronounced in this case The question raised by the demurrer is the right of the plaintiff to maintain this action This question is in my opinion stare decisis in this State and ought not to be reopened For years the statute law of this State has declared the  Eastern Lunatic Asylum  now the  EasternState Hospital to be a corporation There is no qualification respecting its character as a corporation and it has therefore been deemed in all respects a corporation under the general law sec 1068 of the Code with liability to be sued like other corporations The contention that this institution as a part of the State government is not liable to be sued was presented in the petition for a writ of error in the case of the Eastern Lunatic Asylum v Garrett 27 Gratt 163 In that case Judge Staples in speaking of this same institution and in direct response to the question raised by the petition says The asylum is a corpora tion and as such may be sued in trespass or trover and it was held liable accordingly for the wrongful conversion of chattels in an action of trover which is an action arising ex delicto and judgment given against it 1899 541VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER In the case of McClanahan v Western Lunatic Asylum 88 Va 466 where the statute of limitations was relied on to defeat a claim asserted by the asylum against the administrator of a deceased patient for support the contention was made that the asylum stood in the shoes of the State and that the maxim  nullum tempus occurrit regi  was applicable in its favor but this court held the contention unsound sus tained the plea of the statute and declared the asylum to be a corpo ration with power to sue and be sued and entitled to and amenable to all legal defences pertaining to private persons Each of the cases cited it seems is necessarily overruled by the conclusion reached in the case at bar for if the asylum be the State in the broad sense it is now held to be then it cannot be sued and time does not run against its demands The decision in Garretts Case has been acquiesced in as a correct determination of the question presented by this record for more than twenty years and in like manner the decision in McClanahans Case has been accepted as a correct construction of the statute for nearly eight years Although the legislature is called upon at every session to deal with the interests of these institutions it has never seen fit to declare by any change in the phraseology of the law its disapproval of the view taken in either of the cases cited Since the decision in Garretts Case there has been a complete revision of the laws of the State and it is worthy of note that the learned judge delivering the opinion in that case was one of the revisors and yet no change in the law was then suggested in consequence of that decision on the contrary the revised Code of 1887 sec 1661 significantly declares that the directors for each of said asylums and their successors shall respectively continue to be corporations It is a familiar rule of construction that when a statute has been construed by the courts and is then reenacted by the legislature the construction given to it is presumed to be sanctioned by the legislature and thenceforth becomes obligatory upon the courts Mangus v McClelland 93 Va 786 With great respect it seems to me that the conclusion of the majority of the court wholly disregards this wise and well settled canon of construction It is contended that a judgment in this case would be ineffectual if obtained there being no property out of which it could be made This question does not arise on demurrer and if it did we ought not to be influenced in determining the right to maintain the action by 542 DecMAIA V EASTERN STATE HOSPITAL any consideration of the plaintiffs ability to make his judgment avail able If it be true as contended that application to the legislature for payment of the judgment if obtained would be the only way in which satisfaction could be secured the aggrieved party is denied that re source by the conclusion that he cannot maintain his action at all for until the amount of damage sustained has been ascertained by a jury he has no claim to present Affirmed NOTEThis decision is clearly right and the opinion is a strong one As shown in the opinion if a municipal corporation which has both a private and a public character is not responsible for the negligence of its servants in the exercise of its public functions a fortiori must a corporation which is wholly public and without private attributes be exempt in like cases The decision must be regarded as overruling McClannahan v Western Lunatic Asylum 88 Va 466if that case was not already overruled by Philips v University as pointed out in a note to the latter case in our November number There seems to be little or no distinction between the principal case and the approved line of authorities exempting a county from liability for the negligence of its agents and servants Fry v Albemarle 86 Va 195 Field v Albemarle Va 20 S E 954 1 Dillon Munic Corp 2225 The distinction which the court draws between the principal case and Garrett v Eastern Lunatic Asylum 27 Gratt 163 is obvious and is supported by abundant authority While a municipal or other public corporation is not in general re sponsible for the ordinary negligence of its servants in the performance of gov ernmental functions a proposition probably not controverted by any reputable authorityit is well established that such corporations are responsible where they actually take and enjoy the property of the citizen and in such case it is no defense that the act was done in a governmental capacity If the city of Richmond for example should enter upon the private property of a citizen without his consent and without condemnation proceedings and proceed to use it for municipal purposes the plea of public corporation acting in a govern mental capacity would not protect it from an action of ejectment or of tres pass for damages Yet if a driver employed by its fire department should neg ligently run over a passenger in the street or its fire engine by the negligence of those operating it should set fire to private property or other negligent injuries be caused by members of the fire department the city is not responsiblethe duty of putting out fire being a public one Alexander v Vicksburg 68 Miss 564 Jewett v New Haven 38

negligent wrongs generally growing out of the exercise of its public func tions with the notable exception of negligence in the matter of maintaining its streets 2 Dillon Munic Corp 980 et seq monographic note to Mayor etc of New York v Workman 14 C C A 530 534546 monographic note to Goddard v Inhabitants 30 Am St Rep 373 376413 Yet it is equally well settled that where a municipal corporation wrongfully in vades the property of the citizen in the exercise of some right or duty not ultra vires it is liable for the resulting damagethough the right or duty be a public one It is a fundamental principle of our government that private property can not be taken for public use without just compensation Thus such a corporation is liable for the value of stone taken from private property in order to repair a bridge Hawks v Charlemont 107 Mass 417 and for tearing down plaintiffs fence wrongfully alleged to be an encroachment on the street Weed v Green wich 45 Conn 170 Lee v

consent Dooley v City of Kansas 82 Mo 444 52 Am Rep 380 Sheldon v Kalamazoo 24 Mich 383 The principles established by these authorities make perfectly clear the distinc tion between the principal case and Garrett v Eastern Lunatic Asylum In the principal case the tort complained of was a mere negligent omission of duty on the part of the officials of the corporation in the exercise of its public functions In the Garrett Case there was a taking of the plaintiffs property and its use by the corporation Both cases were decided right in strict accordance with principle The concessum noted in the opinion that even were a judgment recovered against the c3rporation its property could not be subjected to satisfy the judgment but the plaintiff would be relegated to the precarious remedy of an appeal to the legis lature is an important one If this be true with respect to a judgment in tort the same result must follow if the judgment be on contract Hence it follows that a duly authorized contract made by this hospital or by any other purely public cor poration in the Statefor example the University of Virginia the Virginia Mili tary Institute the several Lunatic Asylums the Deaf and Dumb and Blind Institu  tionis practically nonenforceable by law And this is sound on principle A judgment against a municipal corporation is not leviable of the public property of the corporation 1 Dillon Munic Corp 170 MIeriwether v Garrett 102 U S 472 It is possible however that since some of these institutions have an income de rived from private patronage in addition to the State annuity such income might be sequestrated by proper judicial proceedings Certainly a judgment against a municipal corporation may be satisfied by enforcing by mandamus the sequestra tion of its inccme derived from taxation and if necessary compelling a sufficient tax levy to meet the judgment 2 Dillon Munc Corp 850 et seq 544 Dec

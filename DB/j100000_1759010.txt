The writers name is in all cases required as proof of good faith Pairing of the firstborn IN SCIENCE of March 16 p 107 Charles S Minot estimates the chance of the firstborn male pairing with the firstborn female where there are ten birds of each sex to pair as one to one hundred It is easy to see that the firstborn male must pair with one of the tell females he is therefore as likely to pair with the firstborn female as with any other one and hence the chance that the firstborn male will pair with the firstborn female is as one to ten instead of as one to one hundred J E HENIRICKS Des Moines March 27 1883 Thermal belts of North Carolina The abstract of Prof J W Chickerings paper on the above topic SCIENCE p 147 has suggested to me the propriety of putting on record the results of observations made by me nimany years ago on the frostless zones  of the flanks of the mountain spurs adjacent to the valleys in the Blue Ridge My obser vations were made at Flat Rock snear Hendersonville Henderson County NC a wellwatered fertile mountainplateaulike valley which is about 2200 feet above the sealevel My own observations and the information elicited from residents seem to indicate the following facts which if verified in other places may have a bearing on the physical causes which give origin to the  frost less zones viz the zones in question are not ex empt from frost during the whole of the cold season in fact during the winter the ground in these belts is frequently frozen to a considerable depth but during the spring months they are conspicuously and uniformly frostless They coincide with the noc turnal and morning fogbelts of the spring months The uniform presence of these white circumscribed belts of fog on the flanks of the mountain spurs during the early morning hours imparts a striking NCE VOL I No 10 feature to the scenery of these valleys When illu minated by the bright morning sun they appear like girdles of cottonwool of moderate width encircling the peaks at the height of 200 or 300 feet above the adjacent valleys and their cumuluslike whiteness contrasted with the verdure above and below them is no less striking than it is beautiful The latter circumstance seems to furnish an expla nation of the physical cause of the socalled thermal belt  for the constant fogs at night and in the morn ing not only prevent refrigeration by obstructing ter restrial radiation but during the condensation of vapor in the process of fogformation there must be developed an enormous amount of heat just at this zone Why this condensation of aqueous vapor should be so persistently restricted to a belt of only a few hundred feet in vertical thickness is a question much more difficult to answer The observations of intelligent residents of the mountain valleys in the southern divisions of the Ap palachian chain will doubtless verify or disprove the general coincidence of the frostless zone with the fogbelt and this is the point which some of the readers of SCIENCE may be able to settle JOHN LECONTE Berkeley Cal March 27 1883 Plight of the flyingfish A note in SCIENCE of March 23 concerning the flight of the flyingfish leads me to offer the results of my own observations During a passage through the Indian Ocean in 1880 I had so numerous and excellent opportunities for observing the movements of flyingfish in all kinds of weather that I deter mined to discover if possible whether or not the wings were of material aid in flight beyond a mere buoyant action In many cases the fish would con tinue its flight for a surprisingly long period some times in the face of the wind Again the direction of flight would be changed in such a way as to render it improbable that the wind was the cause When an object is passing over a rapidly changing surface it is very easy to inmagine it to rise or fall in unison with the latter but so frequently did I notice a fish clear advancing waves that I finally was forced to believe them to have the power of controlling their flight I frequently called upon other passengers to confirm my own observations with which their testimony was in general harmony I may say therefore that I finally leached the same conclusions as those pre sented by Mr Kneeland D P PENHALLOW Mountainville NY March 29 1883 THIE NATURAL HISTORY OP OHIO Report of the geological survey of

LETTER TO THE REVEREND MR WETSTEIN F R S DATED FEBRUARY 15 1755,I206914,XXIV AN ACCOUNT OF THE SEVERAL EARTH QUAKES OF LATE FELT AT CONSTANTINOPLE BY HIS EXCELLENCY JAMES PORTER ESQ HIS MA JESTYS AMBASSADOR AT THAT PLACE IN A LETTER TO THE REVEREND MR WETSTEIN F R S DATED FEBRUARY 15 1755 HISTORIANS OF THE LOWER EMPIRE GIVE US VARIOUS ACCOUNTS OF EARTHQUAKES WHICH HAVE HAPPENED AT CONSTANTINOPLE GILLIUS IN FORMS US OF MANY OF LATER DATE AND AN ANCIENT CO Q 2 LUMN READ APRIL 17 1755116 LUMN STANDING IN THE CITY CALLED THE BURNT PILLAR DECLINES FROM THE PERPENDICULAR AS A TESTIMONY OF SOME CONSIDERABLE SHOCK THE ONLY MEMORABLE ONE I HAVE HEARD MENTIONED WAS IN THE YEAR 1719 WHICH SEEMED SO RATHER FROM THE CONTINUATION OF SEVERAL SHAKES FOR THIRTY DAYS THAN ANY CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE SOME INCONSIDERABLE AND SCARCE MERITING NOTICE I HAVE FELT IN DIFFERENT SEASONS ONE VERY SENSIBLE ON THE 1526TH OF MAY 1752 AT FIVE IN THE MORNING WE HAD AN ACCOUNT OF A VIOLENT EARTHQUAKE AT ADRIANOPLE THAT YEAR ON THE 1829TH OF JULY AT ABOUT EIGHT P M THAT IT WAS ATTENDED WITH UNCOMMON FISSURES AND OPENINGS OF THE EARTH AND ERUPTIONS OF WATERS CARRYING A SULPHUREOUS STENCH CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE WAS DONE TO MANY MOSCHES AND HOUSES THE RUINS REMAIN TO THIS DAY LESSER SHAKES WERE FELT THE WHOLE MONTH OF AUGUST WE DID NOT HEAR WHETHER IT EXTENDED TO THE WESTWARD NOR OF ANY PARTICULAR PHAENOMENA PRECEDING IT ON THE SAME DAY AND HOUR WE HAD IT VERY STRONG AT CONSTANTINOPLE IT LASTED SOME SECONDS I MARKD THE WIND AT SOUTH THAT MORNING AND THE SPIRITS IN THE THERMOMETER AT 40 THE MERCURY IN A SMALL MERCURIAL THERMOMETER OF BIRDS STOOD AT 79 THE AFTERNOON THE WIND CAME ABOUT TO THE E S E A STRONG GALE WHICH CONTINUED DURING THE EARTHQUAKE ITS FIRST MOTION APPEARED TO US PERPENDICULAR AND A HEAVING OF THE HOUSE AND US AS IT WERE OFF OF OUR CHAIRS IT WAS SUCCEEDED BY THREE OR FOUR REGULAR MOMENTANEOUS HORIZONTAL VIBRATIONS SO THAT THE WALLS OF THE HOUSE RECEDED AND RETURNED LIKE THE RECIPRO CAL MOTIONS OF A SHIP AND IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY WE STOOD FIRM THESE VIBRATIONS WE JUDGED HAD THEIR DIRECTION117 DIRECTION FROM N W TO S E AND THEIR ORIGIN FROM ADRIANOPLE THE THERMOMETER AT THAT TIME STOOD AT 36 THE MERCURY AT 81 A DEAD CALM SUCCEEDED AND AT 11 AT NIGHT I MARKED THE SPIRITS 37 AND MERCURY 80 THE LETTERS FROM SMYRNA TOLD US THAT A SMALL SHAKE WAS FELT THERE AT THE SAME HOUR SO THAT IF WE COULD SUPPOSE ALL THE CLOCKS AND WATCHES EXACT AND THAT THE FIRST EXPLOSION OF THE IGNEOUS MATTER WAS AT OR ABOUT ADRIANOPLE WE MUST CONCLUDE THE COM MUNICATION OF THESE VAST DISTANT MOTIONS TO HAVE BEEN INSTANTANEOUS AND THOUGH WE SHOULD VARY SOME MI NUTES THE VELOCITY IS INCREDIBLE AND MAY BE THOUGHT NEARLY TO COME UP TO THAT OF SOUNDS WE HAD ON THE 9TH OF NOVEMBER THAT YEAR A SMALL SHAKE AT 530 A M SPIRITS 68 A M 66 P M MERC THER 56 A M 54 P M WIND N E FAIR WEATHER THE MOST VIOLENT ONE I EVER FELT WAS ON THE 2D OF SEPTEMBER 1754 AT 10 AT NIGHT THE PRECEDING MONTH DID NOT VARY 4 OR 5 DEGREES OF HEAT FROM OTHER YEARS IT CAME AS THAT OF THE 29TH OF JULY WITHOUT ANY PREPARATORY SIGNS AND WITH THIS DIFFERENCE ONLY THAT IT WAS IN A DEAD CALM THE WIND THAT DAY HAD BEEN FROM E N E TO E THE SKY AT NIGHT WITH SHORT CLEAR UNDULATING CLOUDS SOME BLUER THAN OTHERS AND A BRIGHT MOON THE FIRST SHOCK SEEMED INTIRELY PER PENDICULAR AND THE HOUSE WITH A VIOLENT CRACK HEAVED AS IT WERE OFF OF ITS FOUNDATION SO THAT THE FLOOR OF A LARGE CHAMBER SEEMED TO RISE FROM THE EXTERIOR WALL OF THE HOUSE TO THE INTERIOR OF THAT ROOM AND MADE A PERFECT INCLIND PLANE THE WINDOWS APPEARED TO ME HIGHER AND THE CHAIR IN WHICH I SAT NEAR THAT INTERIOR WALL TO SINK LOWER AND WHEN I ROSE UP I PERCEIVED118 PERCEIVED THE INCLINATION VERY SENSIBLY IT SETTLED SOON AFTER AND WAS SUCCEEDED BY SEVERAL HORIZONTAL VIBRA TIONS ALL THE PENDULUMS STOPPD MINE PRECISELY AT TEN SOME AT A FEW MINUTES AFTER OR BEFORE ACCORD ING TO THEIR GREATER OR LESS REGULARITY MY SERVANTS TOLD ME THAT THE HORSES ROSE FROM THEIR LITTER WITH VIOLENT EMOTIONS AND CONTINUED SOME TIME UNEASY ALL THE FOWLS WERE ON THE WING AND CACKLED DOGS AND CATS RAN ABOUT SEIZD WITH FEAR THE WELLS OF WHICH I HAVE THREE BECAME THE ONE DRY THE OTHERS ALMOST SO THE DAMAGE WAS CONSIDERABLE BUT MOSTLY AMONGST THE OLD STONE OR BRICK BUILDINGS AS MOSCHES THE SEVEN TOWERS PUBLIC KHANS AND OLD WALLS ALL THE HOUSES ARE BUILT WITH WOOD AND MUD BRICK DRIED ONLY BY THE SUN WHICH THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY PRETEND TO BE BY THE LESS WEIGHT ON THE FOUNDATIONS A GREATER SECURITY AGAINST EARTHQUAKES IN FACT NONE BUT VERY OLD ONES AND BUT FEW SUFFERED THOSE WELL REPAIRED CAME OFF UNHURT OR WITH SOME CRACKS AND FISSURES ONLY IT WAS IMMEDIATELY SAID THAT THE PER SONS KILLED AMOUNTED TO SOME HUNDREDS BUT THE TRUTH IS THERE WERE NOT ABOVE SIXTY THE MORE ELEVATED THE APARTMENTS THE MORE SENSIBLE THE SHOCK THOSE WHO WERE IN THE STREETS OR IN THE FIELDS IN MOTION DID NOT FEEL IT THE DURATION BY MANY WAS EXTENDED TO MINUTES BUT AS FAR AS I COULD JUDGE IT DID NOT EXCEED SOME SECONDS AT MOST 30 THE THERMO METER AT 48 A M 47 P M THE MERCURY AT 74 A M 72 P M AND THE MERCURY IN THE BAROMETER AT 2

TOWARDS THE CONFINES OF DIAR BECKIR OR MESOPOTAMIA WHERE IT HAS DONE SOME DAMAGE THENCE IT CAME ON WEST AND LEFT GREAT RUINS IN SOME SMALL TOWNS AND VILLAGES PASSED TO NICOMEDIA AND SO TO CONSTANTINOPLE WE HAD NO ACCOUNT OF ITS EXTENDING TO ADRIANOPLE IT WAS MERELY FELT AT SMYRNA OTHER SHAKES WERE FELT THAT NIGHT AT TWELVE OF THE CLOCK AND ON THE 3D AT 10 AND 12 A M WIND AT E AND S E

FIERY CORRUSCATIONS DIRECT AND TRANSVERSAL SOMETIMES STELLATE LIKE STARS SOME TIMES LIKE LAMINAE OR BLADES INTERMIXED WITH SEEM ING BLUE OR SULPHUREOUS STEAMS PRECISELY AT 9 THERE ISSUED FROM IT A HOLLOW RUMBLING SOUND THE CLOUD SUDDENLY BROKE FORTH AS IT WERE FROM A FIXD POINT AND BY AN EQUAL SLOW MOTION TRAVERSED THE WHOLE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE WHICH WAS BEFORE AND RE MAINED AFTER EXTREMELY BRIGHT AND CLEAR THE NOISE CONTINUING120 CONTINUING AS IT APPROACHED US LIKE ONE UNINTERRUPT ED CONFUSED PEAL OF THUNDER ACCOMPANIED FIRST WITH A SHOWER OF HAIL AND SOON AFTER CONVERTED INTO A HEAVY RAIN IT LODGED ITSELF DUE EAST WHERE IT CON TINUED EMITTING FLAME AND DIMINISHING UNTIL AT INFERREDABOUTINFERRED 10 30 IT SEEMED TO HAVE CONSUMED ITSELF IF THIS COLLECTED MASS OF IGNEOUS STEAMS AND VAPOUR HAD FREED US FROM EARTHQUAKES IT MIGHT BE PRE SUMED TO HAVE HAD SOME IMMEDIATE CONNECTION WITH THEM HOWEVER IT MAY BE WORTH OBSERVATION WHE THER SUCH AN EVAPORATION MIGHT NOT DIMINISH THE

ARSENAL UP TO THE FRESHWATER RIVER FROM THESE OBSERVATIONS IT DOTH NOT APPEAR THAT THERE ARE ANY FIXED OR PROBABLE PROGNOSTICS OF EARTHQUAKES BUT THAT THEY COME ON US INDISCRIMINATELY IN THE MIDST OF HIGH WINDS AND CALMS HEAT AND COLD RAIN SNOW AND FAIR WEATHER SO THAT NO OTHER CONNEXION CAN BE SUSPECTED OF THESE WITH THE ATMOSPHERE THAN MERELY THE COLLECTED MASS OF IGNEOUS EXHALATIONS PERCEIVED ON THE123 THE 6TH OF SEPTEMBER AT NIGHT UNLESS THE DIRECTION OF THE WINDS WHICH SEEMED MOST COMMONLY NEARLY IN THE SAME LINE WITH THE SHAKES OF THE EARTHQUAKES MIGHT BE THOUGHT TO HAVE ANY 2DLY WHAT SOME OF THE ANCIENTS HAVE TOLD US OF THE SPRING AND AUTUMN BEING THE TWO USUAL SEASONS FOR EARTHQUAKES APPEARS NOT ONLY FROM THESE BUT WHAT HAS BEEN OBSERVED BY OTHERS TO BE NO GENERAL SECURE RULE SINCE THEY HAPPEN EQUALLY IN ALL SEASONS 3DLY THE VELOCITY OF MOTION AND THE DISTANCE OF THE LINE OF COMMUNICATION APPEAR EXTREMELY SUR SURPRISING FROM ADRIANOPLE TO SMYRNA IN A RIGHT LINE IS NOT LESS THAN 250 MILES AND TO CONSTANTINO PLE 150 MILES POSSIBLY THE REASON IT WAS FELT WITH LESS FORCE AT THE FORMER OF THESE PLACES ARISES FROM THE DIFFERENCE OF DISTANCE AND THAT ITS FORCE DECREASED IN PROPORTION TO IT WHENCE WE MIGHT FORM A CON JECTURE ON SOME GROUNDS THAT THE ORIGIN OF THE EX PLOSION WAS AT OR ABOUT ADRIANOPLE SIVAS IN A RIGHT LINE I COMPUTE AT ABOUT 750 MILES I CANNOT YET BE INFORMED OF THE HOUR OR PRE CISE TIME WHEN THEY FELT IT THERE I HEARD THAT IT WAS ON THE SAME DAY THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY OBSERVING TO REMEMBER TO AN HOUR N B THE THERMOMETER IS GRADUATED

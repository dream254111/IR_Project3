S from the Rev Nathanael Bliss M A Savilian Professor of Mathematics at Oxford and Astronomer Royal My Lord A S I had reason to believe from a calculation made from the best lu nar tables that the northwest limit of the annular appearance in the late great eclipse of the Sun would pass but a few miles to the Southwest of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich I thought myself indis pensably obliged to leave Oxford where my em ployment then called me and to attend to an obser vation which might possibly be of some consequence And I had at the same time an opportunity of paying my duty to their Royal Highnesses Prince WILLIAM HENRY and Prince HENRY FREDERICK who had signified their intention a few days before of honour ing the Royal Observatory with their presence on that occasion Read May 10 1764 On the 1st of April soon after eight in the morn ing their Royal Highnesses arrived and were pleased to signify to me that it was their desire notwith standing their presence that the observations might be made with all possible accuracy Their Royal Highnesses were also pleased to permit his excellency the142 the Neapolitan envoy extraordinary the right honou rable Lord Leigh Dr Morton S R S and several other gentlemen to be present Early in the morning the sky seemed to promise to be favourable to us but before the time when the eclipse was expected to begin it became so hazy that we almost despaired of making any observation at all However Mr Reeve the assistant observer was pre pared to observe on the triangular leads with a two foot reflecting telescope made by Mr Short and on March 31st 21h 5 3 apparent time he saw the first impression made on the Suns limb by the Moon the sky being got tolerably clear a few minutes be fore Mr John Bird mathematical instrument maker in the Strand with a two feet reflecting telescope made by himself on the leads over the new cham ber did not see the beginning by reason of a tre mor until six seconds later I myself was endea vouring to observe it with an excellent refractor of 15 feet focal length in the great room but having at that time a watery defluxion on my eyes occasioned by a cold I was unfortunately obliged to wipe my eye perhaps at the very time of the contact for at 21h 5 30 when I again applied my eye to the tele scope and placed it on the object the eclipse was sensibly advanced So that I apprehend the begin ning as observed by Mr Reeve to be very near the truth It had been before agreed that Mr Reeve to whose eye the reflecting telescope had been adjusted when armed with Dollonds micrometer should ob serve the quantity of the lucid parts as they decreas ed before the middle and also as they increased after the143 the middle was past while Mr Bird and myself with the old micrometer applied to the 15 foot tube should measure the Moons diameter as seen upon the Sun But unfortunately some time before the middle of the eclipse the haziness became so very thick that we lost sight of the Sun for many minutes But as soon as the clouds began to disperse Mr Reeve ob served the lucid parts as under but did not ascertain the time at either observation 2 55 53 0 23 28 73 47 6 with several others that increased much faster By a mean of six observations made as near the middle as the clouds would permit both by Mr Bird and myself the extremes of which did not differ so much as 3 the Moons equatorial diameter was found to be 29 4512 as seen on the Sun As the observations of the lucid parts were made as fast as the numbers of the micrometer could be read off and as the difference increased but slowly at first we will suppose the two first observations to have been made not long after the time of the mid dle and at the time of the first observation the Sun was at least eclipsed 10 9 digits The Suns horizontal diameter as observed by Mr Reeve with the same micrometer on the day be fore and on the morning of the eclipse was 31 5612 being a mean of six observations not sensibly dif fering About 11 oclock the haziness became so thick that no further observations could be made nor at the time when the end was expected could the Sun be seen At144 At the observatory of the right honourable the Earl of Macclesfield at Shirburn Castle the begin ning of the eclipse was observed at 21h 0 48 ap parent time by one observer and but one second later by the other And the end was observed at 23h 56 10 but this last observation is marked as very doubtful the air being extremely hazy If your Lordship should think the above obser vations worthy of the attention of the Royal So ciety and will be pleased to communicate them to that learned body it will very much oblige My Lord Your Lordships and their most obedient humble servant Nathanael Bliss XXV Ob

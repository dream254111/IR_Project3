LITTLEHALES I Besides incidental and variable errors all sextant observa tions are subject to certain fixed and generally unknown errors as follows r Errors of the instrument These are comprised in a Index error that is the uncertainty of the index error as found or used b Shade glasses this can be corrected in some instruments by reversing but to do so is not always convenient The colored eyepiece is free from this error because affecting alike the direct and the reflected image c Telescope collimation error or lack of parallelism with plane of instrument this like the index error we must expect to exist in some degree d Eccentricity of instrument this can be determined with considerable accuracy if the proper appliances are provi ded but it is not conveniently found and is commonly neglected 138Concerning Sextant Observations e Expansion and contraction of instrument by heat or cold this is not practically susceptible of determination f Graduation error this would probably be combined with eccentricity 2 Artificial horizonerror of the roof this can be eliminated by reversal but to do so is often inconvenient especially with stars 3 Personal error of observer this while susceptible of approximate determination is not a practicable correction 4 Refraction as the correction depends on mean conditions of the atmosphere it is manifestly impossible that this error should be entirely corrected The error due to this cause at low altitudes may be very large In sea observations it often seriously affects the dip correction as well 2 All the foregoing sources of error may conspire in their effect or may partially neutralize one another the resultant of all however will be a fixed but unknown quantity for which we can therefore make no correction We must simply accept the fact and then by combining observations in which the resultant unknown error acts in opposite or contrary directions get rid of it by eli mination The elimination of errors by making them correct each other is the foundation of all delicate observation work with all instruments wherever it can possibly be introduced For instance in accurate triangulation a determination would not be accepted unless the angle were measured with telescope direct and reversed to eliminate the collimation error and a round of angles taken to eliminate the eccentricity by the use of different portions of the limb 3 In determining geographical positions no work however carefully done can be properly accepted that does not depend on observations so combined as to effect the elimination of the fixed and unknown error The effect of the error is exactly the oppo site for observations on opposite sides of the zenith and opposite sides of the meridian 4 For latitude we use therefore circummeridian observations of stars in pairs one north and the other south of the zenith with zenith distances as nearly equal as possible if the fixed error makes the latitude from the north star too large that from the south star will be too small by the same amount the error is eliminated in the mean result 139Concerning Sextant Observations 5 For longitude we must likewise use observations on opposite sides of the meridian If the body observed east of the meridian makes our longitude too great the western body makes it too small by the same amount if symmetrically chosen and in the mean result the error is eliminated In equal altitudes the deter mination is made unconsciously because we do not use or need correct altitudes but only equal altitudes 6 The effect of the fixed and unknown error and its elimination is interesting as exemplified in the Sumner 7 Suppose we obtain our position both latitude and longitude from two stars on the same side of the meridian bearing respec tively either NE and SE or NW and SW the resulting Sumner lines are indicated in the figure in which the full lines are supposed t to be obtained from cor     rect altitudes The effect    of the unknown error        will be shown by the ss  z   parallel dotted lines on     z the right or left of the x   x   full lines according as G 3g 5L a cothe unknown error oper ates to increase or de r o    crease the observed alti  v  s ttude If the former the   c  dotted lines on the right give by their intersection    a the observed position  v from the eastern bodies those on the left b the observed position from the western bodies In neither case is the latitude changed the error in latitude due to the unknown error being eliminated because the observations are on opposite sides of the zenith The longitude by the respective pairs is affected in opposite directions and by an equal amount 8 Now take pairs of stars on opposite sides of the meridian bearing respectively SE and SW or NE and NW In the same figure the full lines show the correct position and the dotted lines the observed positions according as the altitude used is greater or less than the correct altitude in the former case the lowest dotted intersection c gives the observed position from the southern pair of bodies and the highest intersection d the observed position 140Concerning Sextant Observations from the northern pair of bodies in neither case is the longitude changed the error in longitude being eliminated because the ob servations are on opposite sides of the meridian The latitude by the respective pairs is affected in opposite directions by an equal amount 9 To eliminate the error both in latitude and longitude we must therefore combine in either case both pairs of stars the NE SE SW and NW stars all being necessarily used and we have practically as in the beginning that for latitude determi nations we must combine observations on opposite sides of the zenith and for longitude determinations observations on opposite sides of the meridian The elimination of the error will not be complete unless the pairs of stars are chosen symmetrically with good conditions however the remaining error will be small 10 From the foregoing it is plain that circummeridian observa tions of the sun are not acceptable for latitude because as a rule we have no suitable body on the opposite side of the zenith to com bine with it and hence no means of eliminating the unknown error Stars must therefore be used there being little trouble in selecting as many pairs as we wish and in each case having by our circummeridian method the benefit of as many altitudes as we wish thus reducing the accidental or variable errors of observation It is essential that the sextant stand be used and preferably the inverting telescope II For longitude also stars are probably susceptible of the greater accuracy equal altitudes being preferable but the sun is generally so much more conveniently used and the observations if carefully taken are withal so accurate that its use is perfectly legiti mate and leaves little to be desired as to the results Equal altitudes should be used and several complete sets of observations taken using in each case both theupper and the lower limb opening and closing contacts in order to make the conditions the same in the AM and the PM observations This is because our estimation of the contact of the limbs is likely to be different for the opening and the clos ing contact The same end of the roof must be towards the observer The sextant stand should be used and the inverting telescope because the more powerful The sextant should be carefully shielded from the sun when not in use Comparisons of the hack with all the chronometers must of course be taken both before and after the observations It is essential that all the observations and all the comparisons should be by the same ob 141Concerning Sextant Observations server the same assistant should also mark on each occasion the tiine on shore In short every care should be taken to have all the circumstances of the observations the same and hence the fixed errors in the same direction they are thus eliminated from the result which depends in meridian distances not on the actual values obtained but on their difference 12 When the time is limited or it is desired to complete the observations for position by one trip to the station circummeridian observations of stars in pairs may be used as usual for latitude and east and west prime vertical stars for longitude selecting har monious pairs and accepting the mean result 13 As an alternative a combination of NE SE SW and NW stars may be used for Sumner lines and if symmetrically selected will give a very accurate result as heretofore explained The intersection may be profitably worked out instead of being found by plotting 14 It is sometimes forgotten that in establishing meridian dis tances the first and last observations for chronometer error may be at the place to be located and the intermediate observations at the known place POLAR CLIMATE IN TIME THE MAJOR FACTOR IN THE EVOLUTION OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS ABSTRACT OF A PAPER BY G R WIELAND Under this title the author enters into a field of discussion which has attracted the masters of thought in several branches of science Astronomy physics geology and biology in its wide sense concern themselves with this problem Dr Wieland as a student of biological science takes as a fundamental proposition Life then as far as we have succeeded in scrutinizing it is a function of variable mechanical factors combined with chemism which is fixed and of climate as depend ent mainly on the manner of terrestrial reception of the solar radiant energy Climate although following a fairly fixed trend in itself subject in so far as the globe is concerned to an evolutionary course is at all times in given localities subject to the accidence of countless movable conditions  Amer Jour Sci XVI 40I430 Dec I903 142

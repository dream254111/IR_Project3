constructing His Majestys Ships of War By Robert Seppings Esq one of the Surveyors of His Majestys Navy Communicated by the Right Hon Sir Joseph Banks Bart K B P R S Read March to 1814 NOTWITHSTANDING the rapid improvement in almost every other branch of the arts and sciences within the last century it will scarcely be credited by persons not conversalt with ship building that little or no advancement has been made during that period in naval architecture so far as relates to the dis position of the materials which compose the fabric of a ship whereby alone strength and fixedness of the prts can be obtained This will appear the more extraordinary in Great Britain when it is considered that our very existence as a nation depends upon our naval superiority and when it is further understood that a deficiency of oak timber but more particu larly that of a large scantling calls for such an application of it as will reduce its consumption and make up for the deficiency of its size It is not improbable that the responsibility which would attach to an individual who should attempt an innovation in a MDCCCXIVo P p286 Mr SEPPINGS on a new principle of constructing structure whereby the lives of hundreds might be thought to be endangered together with the great opposition raised against propositions for any material change in long esta blished customs may have occasioned this backwardness in naval improvements This heavy responsibility together with the obstacles which are so frequently thrown in the way of projectors has with out doubt deterred many men eminently distinguished for professional abilities from attempting to carry into effect their ideas on this most arduous and dangerous undertaking to which may be added that not merely their professiotal repu tation but even their peace of mind might have been hazarded thereby For if the ship should be lost although from a very different cause to that of the construction yet would the weight of censure fall upon the new principle and the projector would have to endure the whole burnthen of the charge that his schemes had occasioned not only the loss of the ship but also which is of far more consequence the lives of some hun dreds of his fellowcreatures Whilst on the other hand should the experiment succeed there would not be wanting those who would be ready to detract from that merit which he so richly deserved and which would be purchased by him at so great a risk The writer of the present paper in his various propositions for the improvement of naval architecture has constantly kept in view these two leading axioms  That the strength of a fabric consists not so much in the quantity of the materials of which it is composed as in the disposition the connection and the security of its several parts And  that the strength of a ship let its construction be what it may can neverHis Majestys oShips of War exceed that of its weakest parts and consequently c that partial strength produces general weakness Three 74 gun ships now at sea have already been rebuilt at Chatham on the principle about to be explained and from the favourable reports of those ships the Lords of the Admiralty have given their orders for the building of several new ships upon the same principle To shew in as clear a light as possible the advantages of the application of this new principle to ship building it may be necessary for the information of those who are not ac quainted with that art to give the following general outline of the structure of a ship on the old principle ist The frame of a 74 gun ship is formed of more than eight hundred different timbers placed at right angles to the keel which may be considered as the back bone of an animal and the frame timbers its ribs Each rib is composed of seve ral pieces of the thickness of fourteen inches or thereabouts Between the several divisions of the frame or ribs is a space from one to five inches wide 2dly The whole exterior frame is covered with planks of different thicknesses or to carry on the figure the ribs are covered by a skin of greater or less substance from the ex treme ends of them to the keel or back bone The inside of the frame is also almost entirely lined with planks within which is another partial range as it were of interior ribs at a considerable distance from each other termed riders Sdly Across this frame are pieces of timber called beams united together so as to be of sufficient length to reach from one ide of the ship to the other Ppa 287288 Mr SEPPINGS on a new principle of constructing The use of these beams is to secure the sides of the ship so as to prevent her upper works from spreading and to keep that part which is under water from being compressed by the fluid They are also the supports or bearers of the decks or what we call in houses the girders for the floors and must therefore be of such strength as to endure the weight of the cannon and whatever else is to be placed upon them The usual mode of fastening these to the sides has generally speaking been merely local by two angular pieces of timber or iron called knees bolted to each beam and also to the sides of the ship by which means they were only partially held to the side and there was wanting that continuity of materials and consequently of strength which the new system gives Between the beams and at right angles with them are placed pieces of wood called carlings and at right angles with these consequently parallel to the beams ledges which correspond with joists in a house The planks or flat of the deck floor ing is laid nearly in parallel lines from head to stern upon and at right angles with the beams and is fastened to them and to the carlings and ledges by bolts nails or wooden pins called treenails From this statement it will appear evident that the decks according to the old construction are in nowise connected with the sides of the ship Having thus briefly described the common mode of ship building it will next be proper to point out such of its defects as the new principle tends to remove In the first place it will be perceived that all the materials comp srng the fabric of a ship are disposed nearly at right angles to each otherHis Maestys aS st s oS f War This disposition which in every wooden fabric is well known to the meanest mechanic to be the weakest is particularly so in a ship the immense body of which subject to violent action from impulses in every direction is sustained by a greater pressure on the centre than the extremities arising chiefly from the difference in the fore and after parts of the body to that of the midship or middle part From the want of a continued succession of support from the centre to the extremities originates the tendency to arch ing or hogging This tendency shews itself in a ship from the moment of her launching from whence some idea may be formed to what extent it will be carried in a troubled sea when in the act of pitching she is borne up by the fluid only in her central part while the head and stern are forsaken and therefore unsupported by the water If a straight line be drawn from the head to the stern of a ship whilst on the slip or in the dock no sooner has she en tered her own element than each end of this line will be found to have dropped from two to five or six inches in consequence of the weakness of the fabric and the two extremes wanting the quantum of support which the fluid gives to the central part The length of a 74 gun ship being 170 feet or more it re quires but little knowledge of the strength of timber to per ceive that planking of that length however thick or in whatever way joined or put together must under the present system bend with its own weight The fastenings and con sequently the connection of the several parts of the fabric must therefore suffer for the want of stifness and a change of form is the consequence This may be shewn by putting together four pieces of wood 28929o Mr SEPPINGS on a new principle of constructing and securing them with iron pins in the form of a square which on the least pressure may be made to change its form to the rhombus but let another piece be fixed to it diagon ally and the figure of the frame will be found immoveable Place a bar in the middle parallel to two of the sides and secure it firmly by iron pins still the figure will easily be moved by the hand like a parallel ruler and assume the rhomboidal shape of A or B but apply to the frame what the 0    11 11 carpenters term the brace in a common field gate as Z and the figure will remain as before immoveable rI Z fr  i 1 r rir 7 1  1  rnl Il lyn L  1 If this brace or diagonal piece is not fixed to it the outer part of the gate or that part most distant from the hinges will have a constant tendency downwards until at length it will reach the ground Let fig i and e represent two frames of wood composed of parts strongly connected by bolts or iron pins Fig i Will represent the principle on which the present system of ship building is conducted o  Hlis Majestys Ships of Var Fig s The new principle Let CC represent the fulcrum or point of support And DD two weights attached for the purpose of ascertain ing the comparative strength or stiffness of each frame This experiment will shew that tile stiffiess of fig 2 is to that of fig 1 as 6 is to 1 and the strength as 3 to i The greater the length of the frames the greater will be the advantages of the new principle both in stiffness and strength  1 o  0 o 0 0 o 1 L l  3e   l e  o e 4 l o  lo   C0c 0 0 0  0 a D o A     C D  o     I The substitution of the triangle as in the frame of fig t for the rectangle in the frame fig 1 comprehends the prin ciple of the new system the use and advantages of which will be sufficiently evident The arrangement of the materials in the triangular mode is such that the pieces disposed horizontally are acted upon as ropes are by a strain of the fibre whilst the other parts com posing a series of triangles are pressed upon as pillars in other words the pressure acts in the direction of the fibres of the wood whereas upon the rectangular or old plan the fibres are acted upon transversely or across the grain in the same manner as a stick is when placed across the knee and pressed 29192e Mr SEPPINGS on a new principle of constructing by the hands at each end which first bends and then breaks To prevent any transverse action upon the fibre of the timber is one of the benefits arising from the new system and to impede a longitudinal extension of the structure is another For as the diagonal frame composed of a series of triangles aided by diagonal trussing between the ports prevents the fabric from being acted upon transversely to the fibres of the materials horizontally placed so the wales the plank ing the shelf pieces the improved waterways and the decks systematically secured become the tie beams of the struc ture In a word the system of triangles is so constructed in conjunction with the planking of the ship as conjointly to possess that property of a triangle already explained viz that its figure is as unalterable as the compression or extension of the fibre of timber will admit it to be The strength of the principle has hitherto been considered as applying to or resisting an alteration of the figure by giving great stiffness It is now to be taken in another point of view that of rendering the strength of the fabric as general and united as possible For let it be again observed the strength of any body is but equal to that of its weakest part In the new system the openings between the ribs are filled in with slips of timber nearly to the height of the orlop or lower tier of beams which being then caulked and paid or pitched over makes the frame from head to stern and within a few feet of the greatest draught of water one compact and water tight mass of timber so that were any of the outer planking of the bottom to be knocked off the ship would not only still keep afloat but would be secured from sinking InHis Mfajestys Ships of Yar 293 the old system the starting of a plank would be and often has been fatal The mode of filling in these openings between the frame where the width of the space does not exceed three inches is by driving in slics of wood cut wedgelike two of which being driven one from the outside the other from within form the paralel space of the opening thereby bringing the parts into the closest contact In the openings exceeding the width of three inches the space is occupied by pieces corre sponding with the openings the fibre of such pieces being laid in the same direction as that of the frame timbers These fillings occasion no consumption of useful timber as one fourth of the produce of slab and other offal now sold as fathom wood would supply a sufficient quantity for the con sumption of the whole navy The advantages obtained by filling in the openings are these To add to the strength and durability of the fabric to preserve the health of the crew from the effects of the impure air arising from the filth which soon collects in these openings to render the ship less liable to leakage as well as to facilitate the stoppage of any leak and lastly to increase as it may be said the thickness of the bottom from four or four and a half the usual thickness of the plank to about sixteen inches thereby lessening very considerably the danger to be appre hended from getting on shore or foundering at sea That it tends also to the durability of the ship will be inferred from the fllowing positions ist That the openings in the old principle are after a ship has had any considerable length of service choked up in many parts with an accumulation of filth MDCCcxIV Q q94 Mr SEPPINGS on a new principle of constructing 2dly That no free circulation of air can be obtained in these openings by any means sdly That timber being either freely exposed to or ex cluded from the air is equally preserved 4thly That it has been found on examining the frame and plank of old ships that those parts now filled in generally decay sooner than the rest viz from the floorheads in the midships and from the deadwood forward and abaft to the height of the orlop clamps If the above positions be true it will follow that by filling in these openings much will be added to the durability of the ship which also will be further promoted by omitting in these parts the inside plank leaving thereby the surface of the frame timbers exposed to a free admission of air as often as the ships hold is unstowed and by the filling in excluding the air from two of the sides of every timber By omitting the inside plank much is added to the internal capacity of the ships hold For though the trussed frame projects from the timbers more by five inches than the thick stuff at the floor heads yet as in the old system the per pendicular riders are brought upon the thick stuff their pro jection into the hold is more by eight inches than that of the new the advantage therefore as to stowage is in favour of the diagonal frame A tier of iron ballast will also be disposed of in this principle many inches lower whereby an increase of stability will be given with less weight which will favour the ship in carrying her ports higher out of the water inas much as greater stability will be given with less ballast An accurate conception of the state of the ships hold may be formed by referring to the longitudinal section P1 XHis Majestys Shtis of War figure i which is termed the Jesuits perspective or birds eye view of the internal part of one side of a 74 gun ship in a complete state with fillings in the openings between the timbers of the frames instead of the planking over them In this state the diagonal timbers are introduced intersect ing the timbers of the frame at about the angle of 45 degrees and so disposed as that the direction in the fore is contrary to that of the after part of the ship as may be seen in the engraving and their distance asunder from six to seven feet or more their upper ends abutting against the horizontal hoop or shelf piece of the gun deck beams and the lower ends against the limber strakes except in the midships where they come against two pieces of timber placed on each side of the keelson for the purpose of taking off the partial pressure of the main mast which always causes a sagging down of the keel and sometimes to an alarming degree These pieces of timber are nearly as square as the keelson and fixed at such a distance from it as that the main step may rest upon them They may be of oak or pitch pine and as long as can be con veniently procured Pieces of timber are next placed in a fore and aft direction over the joints of the frame timbers at the floor and first fut tock heads their ends in close contact with and coaked or dowelled to the sides of the diagonal timbers In this state the frame work in the hold presents various compartments each representing the figure of a rhomboid A truss timber is then introduced into each rhomboid with an inclination opposite to that of the diagonal timbers thereby dividing it into two parts The truss pieces so introduced into the rhomboid are to the diagonal frame what the key stone Qqs g95a296 Mr SPPMWGs on a new principe constructng is to the arch for no weight or pressure on the fabric can alter its position in a longitudinal direction till compression takes place at the abutments and extension of the various ties This archlike property of the diagonal frame not only opposes an alteration of position in a longitudinal direction but also resists external pressure on the bottom either from grounding or any other cause because no impression can be made in its figure in these directions without forcing the several parts of which it is composed into a shorter space The connection which is kept up by means of this trussed frame firmly attached to the timbers of the ship by circular coaks and bolts together with the shelf pieces united to the sides and to the several beams by means of the same sort of fastenings gives such unity to the whole as to bear no com parison with that heterogeneous and badly connected mass of materials for which it is substituted It has hitherto been a generally received opinion that stiff ness or inflexibility in a ship is not strength but that a yield ing or bending of the fabric is an essential quality to preserve it from being destroyed by the shocks which it is destined to sustain This misconception must have arisen from an equally in correct idea which is that a ship is an elastic body because thereds a considerable degree of elasticity in the materials of which it is composed But it should be remembered that this elasticity of the materials must be very inconsiderable inas much as the minute degree of elasticity in each piece must necessarily be neutralised in the fabric by the various direc tions and tendencies of the numerous parts of which it isHis Majestys Slhs of War s97 composed so that a ship let her construction be what it may either loose or firm is not in any case elastic It follows then that every action and reaction of the sea operating upon dif ferent parts of the fabric at different times occasions for the want of unity of the whole of the parts a constant and in creasing weakness which by some may have been taken for elasticity When a sea strikes a ship forward the bow will rise with the sea which passing aft lifts the midships in succession leaving at this time in a great measure the fore and aft parts of the ship with comparatively little or no support Such shocks acting upon a body whose parts are not firmly con nected produce a bending and rebending of the fabric so that the several planks of the sides play over each other and the fastenings are strained and loosened by a repetition of this action and reaction On the contrary when a body is con structed with such general unity and fixedness of all its parts as that if one is moved the whole must move with it then it may be said that all the parts of the structure bear their por tion of the strain The decks come next under consideration the beams of which are disposed in the new system nearly as usual except that in midships where a ship necessarily requires the greatest security two additional beams have been introduced The beams of the several decks are attached to the ships side in the following manner 1st By shelf pieces or internal hoops distinguished by the letter E figure  These shelf pieces are composed of several lengths of timber scarphed or joined together by coaks or crcular dowes so as to orm a kitld of internal hoop extending2983 MiMr SEPPINGS on a new principle of constrcting from the hooks forward to the transoms abaft to the under side of which as well as the under parts of the beams they are securely coaked and being then firmly bolted to the side instead of becoming a mere local fixture of the beam to the ships exterior frame as knees were they are one continued and general security The shelf piece is also a tie to the top side in a fore and aft direction cooperating with the trussed frame as already explained 2dly By chocks represented in figure 2 letter H which are placed under all the shelf pices in wake of the beams ex cept the orlop in such a manner as to receive the up and down arm of the iron knees The lower ends of those under the gun deck shelf piece step on the ends of the orlop beams and those of the several decks above step on the projecting part of the spirketting below The chocks particularly those between the orlop and gun decks admit of their being driven into their respective places very tight thereby acting like pillars An other advantage attending them is their great tendency to stiffen the ships side and to prevent the beam ends from playing on the fastenings when the ship is rolling or straining under a press of sail The curved iron plate knees for securing the orlop beams and the iron forked knees of the other decks are described in figures 3 and 2 The flat or planks of the several decks being on the old system each of them a mere platform or in other words a cover to a box unconnected with the sides are here so disposed of as not only to oppose an alteration of figure from a force acting on the ship in a lateral direction but also are made subservient towards securing the beams to the sides of the shipHis Majestys Ships of War The framing and flat of the decks excepting the quarter deck forecastle and roundhouse which are laid upon the old plan are disposed of as represented in figure 5 The former that is the framing or ledges and beams in ticked lines the latter or planks in black those of the starboard side being laid contrarywise to the larboard The midship ends of the diagonal planks abut against two strakes laid in a fore and aft direction without side of the comings of the hatchways the other ends approach the timbers of the frame and the buts at each end are secured to a tier of carlings placed for that purpose The flat or plank of the deck so dis posed is connected with a certain number of coaks to the hooks beams and transoms When the decks are thus laid waterways described in figure 2 are brought upon and coaked to the ends of the plank These waterways being then bolted through the ships sides and also in an up and down direc tion through the flat and shelf pieces combine the whole in one homogeneous mass of strength Few ships are without some complaint of apparent weak ness after three or four years service These defects among other places shew themselves at the beam ends which par tial complaining proceeds in a great degree from the local attachment of the beams to the ships side and the flat or covering being in toto unconnected as already explained The extreme ends of the beams not being properly secured play and work upon the fastenings so that it is not unusual to see the bolt holes cut to an oval figure by the friction of the bolts The remedy usually applied to a ship il this state is to load her with additional materials such as iron knees stand ards breasthooks c thus additng greatly to the original g99300 Mr SEPPINGS on a new principle of constructing weight of the fabric Now it is evident that the first gale of wind the ship encounters after being thus partially strength ened she must be reduced to the same state of weakness she was in before the remedy was applied This mode of strengthening ships may be compared to that of a raft firmly secured in the first place by strong laslhing which after some time works loose or rather by working is stretched As it might be too tedious a business to secure the raft by retightening the lashing a small cord or some twine would be used to answer the purpose It is clear that whilst the small cord or piece of twine remained tight no part of the strain can bear upon the strong but loose lashing till the other stretches or breaks so it is with a ship that has addi tional securities given her without refastening those which had worked or were much strained To remedy defects whether arising from the decay of the materials or from any other cause the principle now applied has many advantages of which a slight inspection of the ships hold figure i will convince but in no respect is this advan tage greater than in the decks for by shifting them when worn too thin for caulking the original connection between the beams decks and sides will be restored as perfect as at first The tendency of the ship to stretch or draw asunder in her upper works being by no means obviated by the short planks on the inside between the ports a truss piece of plank is sub stituted in lieu of them which being well secured at the abut ments very materially aids the trussed frame and gives great stiffness thereby opposing the inclination to arch or hog aloftHis Majestys Ships of Va r0 Figure 4 represents the stern of a ship with the trussing and iron work for its security By this the helm port transom which consumes one of the largest and most difficult trees required for a ship is dispensed with Those essential qualities of strength safety and durability having been detailed a few observations with respect to the economy of the new principle may not be misplaced which though but of a secondary consideration compared to the others yet as the royal navy cannot be kept up without a supply of foreign timber it evidently becomes a subject of considerable moment that upwards of one hundred and eighty oak trees should be saved in a seventyfour and a greater number in larger ships allowing each tree to measure a load or fifty feet rough contents The consumption of this scarce article may be further con siderably lessened in the new system by the use of inferior and old ship timber which cannot be employed in the other and if old ship timber was to be generally introduced as was done in the Ramillies one seventh part of the English oak required for a new 74 gun ship might be saved The facility of ascertaining the state and making good the defects of the frarme in the lower part of the ship in conse quence of omitting the inside planking will also occasion a considerable saving of timber and workmanship indeed the great ease by which any part of the diagonal frame may be replaced justifies the making use of fir timber particularly for the longitudinal piece and trusses But should the well grounded hopes of durability be re alized the saving of timber and indeed of every article re quired for this enormous branch of the national expenditure would be immense MDCCCXIV R r 301o02 Mr SEPPINGS on a new principle of constructing c The author of this paper cannot conclude without observing that the appointment of most excellent and meritorious officers to the ships already completed on his principle may be con sidered as a most favourable circumstance towards ascertain ing the real merits of the construction Indeed the orders for carrying this new principle of con structing His Majestys ships into effect were directed by such an honourable spirit of liberality and so unshackled was the authority given to enable the writer to carry his plans into execution that no subterfuge can avail him should any failure be found in the systemReferences a AXvA sZLner and addn  vmforurwg ar f  nenrtf ivr BB Nzber of thjei goa fime C 1 oorgz pce  ttot D 7iwvee to  Dvti iE  iitesw w ozrss

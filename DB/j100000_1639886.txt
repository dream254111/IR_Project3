department of anthropology at the Worlds Columbian Exposition at Chicago and not only brought together what was probably the greatest archeological and anthro pological exhibit ever gathered in this country up to that time but collected by the aid of numerous collaborators a vast mass of data in regard to our native peoples which has not yet been fully worked up The specimens so brought together for the Exposition became the nucleus of the present Field Museum of Natural History which may thus be regarded as in its origins of his making In 1894 Professor Putnam was made curator of anthropology in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City and for nearly ten years he applied to its administration and to the building up of its collections the experience he had gained in Cambridge and Chicago It was again largely through his efforts that the University of California established a department of anthropol ogy in 1903 and he held the position of professor of anthropology and director of the anthropolog ical museum in that institution until his retirement in 1909 In his long life of scientific work a great deal of Professor Putnam s attention was necessarily de voted to administrative and editorial duties but he found time nevertheless for the writing of a large number of scientific papers and the bibliography appended to the Anniversary volume presented to him in 1909 by his associates and students con tains something over four hundred titles His membership in scientific societies both at home and abroad was extensive In this country he was a member of the National Academy the American Academy of Arts and Sciences the American Phil osophical Society and a great many others out side the United States he was an honorary or cor responding member of the anthropological societies of Great Britain Paris Stockholm Berlin Rome Florence and Brussels of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and others of minor importance In 1868 he received the degree of AM from Williams College in 1894 the degree of SD from the Uni versity of Pennsylvania and in 1896 the Cross of the Legion of Honor from the French government Professor Putnam was twice married in 1864 to Adelaide Martha Edmands of Cambridge by whom he had three children two daughters and one son After her death fifteen years later he mar ried in 1882 Ester Orne Clarke of Chicago who with his three children survives him To his students and associates Professor Putnam endeared himself by his kindliness and sympathy For every one he had a cordial greeting and a pleasant word He was ready always to give un stintedly of his time and so far as he was able from his pocket to any one who asked his aid He hadc the gift of inspiring those with whom he came in contact with enthusiasm for research and to few is it given to have so wide an influence Until the very last years the great majority of those in this country who were working in the anthropological field had been associated more or less closely with Professor Putnam either as stu dents or colleagues in the various institutions of which he had been a member His loss therefore is widely felt not only because he was an able ad ministrator and the last of the three founders of anthropological study in this country but also be cause he had won the affections of so many as a teacher and a friend SCIENTIFIC NOTES

States Geo logical Survey the value of the clay products of this country in 1914 are given as 164 986983brick and tile 129588822 and pot tery 35398161 This was a considerable de crease compared with 1913 but as compared with the value for the last twenty years it shows a great growth in the industries Com pared with 1908 there was an increase of 31 789221 In only four years1909 1910 1912 and 1913has the total value of clay products exceeded that of 1914 Considered by the average for fiveyear periods which is perhaps the fairest comparison as unusual conditions may occur in a single year the average annual value of the clay products of the United States was 18951899 72233056 19001904 118 135826 19051909 153838231 and 1910 1914 170287909 It will be seen that the value of the clay products of the country has considerably more than doubled in the last twenty years With the revival of business which is clearly indicated the great clay working industries with the inherent supe riority of their products for many uses are bound to come into their own the halt of 1914 being but a temporary setback which will be more than overcome in the near future Clay products are made in every state Of the terri tories Alaska and Hawaii reported none The value of clay products ranged in 1914 from 5974 in Porto Rico to 37166768 in Ohio Ohio reported over one fifth of the value of clay products in 1914 and has been the lead ing state since figures on this subject were first compiled by the Geological Survey in 1894 It is likely to maintain this position as its out put has always greatly exceeded that of the second state Pennsylvania and in 1914 this excess was 15319772 or over 70 per cent Pennsylvanias output in 1914 was valued at 21846996 or over one eighth of the total for the United States New Jersey ranked third in 1914 with products valued at 16 484652 Illinois was fourth with products valued at 13318953 and New York was fifth with products valued at 9078933 Indiana was sixth Iowa was seventh exchanging places with Missouri which was eighth West Vir ginia was ninth exchanging places with Cali fornia which was tenth The first ten states reported wares valued at 128253688 or 7274 per cent of the total The first five states re ported wares valued at 97896302 or nearly 60 per cent of the total UNIVERSITY AND EDUCATIONAL NEWS MR JAMES J HILL has presented 125000

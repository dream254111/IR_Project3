J100587,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16831775,102616,A DISCOURSE OF THE OPERATION OF A BLISTER WHEN IT CURES A FEVER MADE AT A MEETING OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY BY WILLIAM COCKBURN MD OF THE COL OF PHYS IN LOND AND FRS,I206886,161 III A D I S C O U R S E OF THE OPERATION OF A BLISTER WHEN INFERREDITINFERRED CURES A FEVER MADE AT A MEETING OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY BY WILLIAM COCKBURN MD OF THE COL OF PHYS IN LOND AND FRS IN PURSUANCE OF AN ORDER OF THIS SOCIETY I SHALL EN DEAVOR TO ENTERTAIN YOU WITH A REASONABLE ACCOUNT HOW THE RAISING OF A BLISTER MAY CURE A FEVER AND ITS MOST TERRIBLE SYMPTOM THE DELIRIUM AND THAT IN SIXEIGHT OR TEN HOURS THIS I CHUSE TO DO TOWARDS THE IMPROVEMENT OF MY OWN PROFESSION AND TO MIND SOME MALICIOUS PEOPLE THAT WE ARE NOT WHOLLY IMPLOYED WITHIN THESE DOORS IN THE DESCRIBING THE FEATURES AND DRESSES OF FLIES BUT IN DISCOVERING TOO HOW THEY MAY BENEFIT AND HURT MAN KIND WHICH IS THE ULTIMATE END OF ALL OUR STUDY WHEN I FIRST RESOLVED TO MAKE THIS THE SUBJECT OF MY DISCOURSE I DESIGND TO BE MORE FULL AND TO HAVE EX TENDED IT TO AN ENQUIRY ABOUT THE POWER THESE INSTRU MENTS HAD TO MAKE A WOUND IN WHAT MANNER AND FOR WHAT REASONS SUCH A WOUND WAS MADE AND PRODU CED SUCH EFFECTS BUT THE SUBJECT PROVED ENDLESS AND I CAN ASSURE YOU BY MUCH TOO LONG FOR THIS PLACE THO MOST AUTHORS HAVE GONE IT OVER SLIGHTLY ENOUGH IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO GIVE YOU A LIST OF THESE SIM PLES THAT HAVE BEEN FOUND TO MAKE A BLISTER SINCE THAT IS AS USELESS TO YOU AS IT IS FOREIGN TO MY PURPOSE NEITHER IS IT PROFITABLE IN OUR PRESENT BUSINESS TO LAY BEFORE YOU THE COMMON AND VISIBLE EFFECTS OF LAYING ON A BLISTER FOR I MAY BELIEVE THAT THERE IS HARDLY ONE A A IN162 N THIS KINGDOM WHO HAS LIVD SO LONG AS TH E YOUNGEST MAN NOW IN THIS ROOM THAT HAS NOT HAD EITHER ONE HIM SELF OR SEEN IT ON A FRIEND HE HAS SEEN A PLAISTER THE GREAT INGREDIENT WHEREOF ARE CANTHARIDES LAID ON A FLESHY PART AND TO HAVE FORCED UP THE SCARFSKIN WITH A LIQUOR THAT OOSED AND ISSUED OUT FROM WITHIN THE SPHERE OF ACTIVITY OF THAT PLAISTER AND IF WE CONSULT THE MOST OF PHYSICKBOOKS THE ACCOUNT IS NO BETTER BUT SOMETIMES WORSE TURN OVER A FAMOUS AUTHOR WHERE HE WRITES OF OUR PRESENT SUBJECT AND HE TELLS YOU THAT THERE IS A VERY GREAT ANALOGY BETWEEN THE OPERATION AND BL STERING BY FIRE AND THE KNOWN INSTRUMENTS FOR MAKING OF A VESI CATING PLAISTER AND THEN ADDSTHAT PARTICULAE IGNEAE HAUD

AFTERWARDS QUOD AUTEM ILLA PRIMO IN SPIRITUS AGUNT INDE CONSTAT QUOD IN DEFUNCTIS VIM NULLAM EXERUNT ETIAM IN LANGUIDIS MALUM OMEN EST C THIS IS AN AUTHOR OF THE FIRST FORM AND I DOUBT NOT BUT THAT THESE HIS WORDS PROVE SUFFICIENTLY WHAT I AL LEDGED THAT LITTLE OR NOTHING HAS BEEN SAID MORE PAR TICULARLY163 TICULARLY THEN ANY ONE MAY OBSERVE EVERY DAY SUPPO SING ONLY THAT HE THINKS THAT OUR  THUS COVERED AT ANY TIME WITH A BLISTER IS MADE UP OF MANY AND DIVERS VESSELS OUT OF WHICH THE DISCHARGED WATER MAY COME AND NOT TO BE NICE WITH OUR AUTHOR I MUST OBSERVE THAT HE FALLS INTO AS GREAT ERRORS AS CAN BE IMA GINED WHEN HE PRETENDS TO SEE MORE THAN THE MOST COMMON AND ORDINARY PERSON HE SAYS THAT THE PARTS OF FIRE AND CONSEQUENTLY THOSE OF A BLISTERING INSTRU MENT MAKE THEIR WAY WITHOUT A SOLUTIO CONTINUI THAT THEY ATTACK THE ENDS OF ALL THE VESSELS OR THE EXTREMI TIES OF ALL THE VESSELS AND TO BE MORE PARTICULAR HE TELLS US THAT THEY FIRST OF ALL AFFECT THE SPIRITS NOW I SAY HE TELLS US ALL THIS BECAUSE HE DOES NOT ENDEAVOUR TO PROVE ANY ONE BUT THE LAST AND THAT I THINK HE HAD BETTER LEFT UNPROVED TOO IT LOOKS A LITTLE ODDLY THAT ALL THIS SHOULD BE DONE MERELY BY ENTERING THE PORES AND YET IT IS NOT THAT HE SEEMS TO HINT THO I CAN NOT WELL IMAGINE HOW HE DID APPREHEND IT TO BE DONE BUT THAT THEY SHOULD ATTACK THE EXTREMITIES OF THE VES SELS AND EVEN THE SPIRITS FIRST IS A VAST CONTRADICTION TO THE CIRCULAR MOTION OF THE BLOOD AND TO THE WAY OF MAKING A BLISTER WE SHALL FIND UNANSWERABLE DIFFI CULTIES NOT ONLY IN THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD BUT THAT THE BLOOD SHOULD MOVE AT ALL IF ONCE WE ARE ABLE TO PROVE THAT VESSELS HAVE ENDS OR THAT THEY TERMINATE IN ANY MANNER OF WAY BUT IN THEMSELVES IT CANNOT SO MUCH AS BE BROUGHT AS AN EXCUSE FOR THIS AUTHOR THAT BY THE EXTREMITIES OF THE VESSELS HE MAY INTEND THE VESSELS OF THE EXTREMITIES THIS IS BY NO MEANS PROPER IN THIS PLACE IF HIS WORDS COULD BEAR IT THE REASON INDEED HE BRINGS FOR THE PARTS OF A BLISTER FIRST BEGINNING WITH THE SPIRITS IS THE MOST WON DERFUL THING IN THE WHOLE MATTER EVEN MORE THAN BLI STERING IT SELF BECAUSE SAYS HE THEY ARE OF NO EFFECT A A 2 WITH164 WITH DEAD PEOPLE GOOD GOD SHOULD THIS AUTHOR HAVE PRONOUNCED ALL THE MOST PROBABLE THINGS IMAGINABLE UP ON THIS OUR SUBJECT COULD ANY ONE BE PERSWADED AF TER THIS THAT HE HAD MADE ANY DISCOVERY AT ALL TAKE A LANCET AND LETT BLOOD OF A DEAD MAN IF YOU CAN IS THE CONSEQUENCE THAT YOU NEVER COULD BECAUSE NOW YOU BRING NO BLOOD IS IT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT THE STAG NATING BLOOD SHOULD COME OUT AT THE INVISIBLE EMISSARIES THAT ARE MADE BY A BLISTER IS IT TO BE THOUGHT THAT THERE CAN BE ANY INFLECTION ANY COMPRESSION IN THE VES SELS OF A DEAD PERSON AND ARE NOT ALL THESE THE EVI DENT AND NECESSARY CONDITIONS FOR MAKING A BLISTER HOW IS IT THEN REASONABLE TO THINK TO RAISE A BLISTER ON ANY ONE THAT IS DEAD OR OF WHAT WEIGHT CAN A CONSEQUENCE BE THAT IS FOUNDED ON SUCH AN EXPERI MENT I HAVE MADE THIS NECESSARY DIGRESSION TO PUT MIND YOU HOW SLIGHTLY THIS MATTER IS TREATED OF AMONG US AND TO CONVINCE YOU THAT IT IS NOT ONLY HARD TO SPEAK UP TO THE WORTH OF OUR SUBJECT AND WITH THAT PARTICU LARNESS THAT BOTH THE THING AND YOU DO REQUIRE BUT THAT IT DEMANDS A LONGER TIME THAN CAN BE WELL ALLOWED TO A DISCOURSE OF THIS KIND YOU WILL BE STILL MORE SATISFIED OF THE TRUTH OF THIS WHEN I TELL YOU THAT I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT MY SELF OBLIGED TO PROVE AND DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE MO TION OF THESE PARTS OF CANTHARIDES THAT BLISTER NOT ONLY BY GIVING A HINT WHAT THEY ARE BUT WITH HOW MUCH FORCE THEY ARE BROUGHT FROM THE BLI STERING PLAISTER AND DRIVEN INTO OUR SKIN VESSELS C I COULD HAVE SATISFIED YOU ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE EMISSARIES THEY MAKE HOW AND FROM WHENCE THE SEPARATED LIQUOR IS BROUGHT BETWEEN THE SKIN AND165 AND SCARFSKIN THAT NOTHING MORE IS NECESSARY BESIDES THE MAKING OF THESE SMALL WOUNDS FOR THE DISCHARGING OF THIS WATERY SUBSTANCE BY A COM MON BLISTER THAT THE VESSELS ARE INDIFFERENTLY ATTACKED AND BROKE UPON BY THESE WOUNDING PARTS AND THO THE VEINS ARE MORE APT TO BE AFFECTED YET THAT NO DISCHARGE IS MADE FROM THEM OR THAT THEY DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO ANY OF THAT LIQUOR WE SEE GATHERED BETWEEN THE SKIN AND SCARFSKIN  AND LASTLY I SHOULD GIVE A REASON WHY THIS WATERY SUBSTANCE SHOULD BE DENIED A PASSAGE IN THE SCARFSKIN OR IN A VERY SMALL AND INCONSIDERABLE QUANTITY NOT WITHSTANDING THAT THESE WOUNDING PARTICLES DO PASS THROUGH BOTH THE SKINS AND ALL THE VESSELS AND FOR THAT REASON THE WOUNDS MAY BE SUPPOSED TO BE OF EQUAL BIGNESS AND EQUALLY CAPABLE TO TRANSMIT THE LIQUORS DO BUT THINK THEN THAT I HAD INSISTED ON VESICATION IN GENERAL OR THAT I HAD PROVD EVERY ONE OF THESE PARTICU LARLY AS I CAN DO WHAT HAD I DONE FOR TIME AND PA TIENCE TO YOU MY HEARERS IN A DISCOURSE ABOUT A BLI STER ANY ONE BUT YOUR SELVES SHOULD BE READY TO BELIEVE THAT EITHER THERE CAN BE NOTHING OF THAT CON SEQUENCE IN THE THING AND THAT THEY WOUD RATHER THROW AWAY MEDICINE ALTOGETHER AT LEAST BLISTERS OUT OF PHY SICK THAN TO BE TROUBLED WITH A DISCOURSE SO LONG THAT IT IS MORE PAINFUL THAN A BLISTER IT SELF I MUST BEG LEAVE TO TELL YOU AT THIS TIME THAT I HAVE IMPLOYED MICROSCOPES TO LOOK ON THE FLY AND ITS POU DER TO SEE IF I COULD DISCOVER ANY SHARP INSTRUMENTS SWORDS DAGGERS INFERREDORINFERRED THE LIKE SORT OF ARMITURE IN THESE WARLIKE AND WOUNDING CREATURES THE FLY BECAME A VERY166 VERY DELIGHTFUL BUT TOO LARGE A SURVEY FOR ME AND THE POUDER BEGOT NOTHING FOR MY SIGHT BUT A DARK CLOUD AND WHATSOEVER ELSE I FOUND I COULD MEET WITH NO ARMS WHICH MAKES ME THINK THAT IF THEY HAVE ANY AS NEEDS THEY MUST THEY ARE CONCEALED AND ARE TO BE DISCOVER ED IN ANOTHER WAY WHEREFORE I RETIRD WITH MY CAN THARIDES AND TURND HALF A POUND OF THEM INTO A RETORT THAT I MIGHT TRY THEIR TEMPER THAT WAY WONDERFUL THERE MY ENQUIRY WAS FULLY SATISFIED THERE CAME OVER WITH THE LEAST SANDHEAT AND IN A VERY SHORT TIME VAST QUANTITIES OF BODIES SO VERY SMALL THAT I WAS NOT ABLE TO DISCERN THEIR SHAPE THIS CONVINCED METHAT THESE PAR TICLES WERE VERY MANY AND MIGHT HAVE AN INDEFINITE DE TERMINATION SINCE THEY WERE SO UNDISCERNIBLY DIVIDED BY SO WEAK AN AGENT YET WITH SO GREAT FORCE AND THEREFORE THAT ALL THE WORLD WILL GRANT THAT THEY CAN MAKE A WOUND AND WHEN THE FORCE IS KNOWN THEIR POWER WILL BE FOUND TO BE OF A LARGE EXTENT WHICH IS ALL THAT I AM CONCERNED WITH AT THIS TIME INSOMUCH THAT I SHOULD BE PERSWADED NOT TO NAME THE PROCESS BUT THAT I KNOW THAT IT WILL PLEASE YOU TO DISCOVER WHAT I MET WITH IN MY TRYALS ON THIS ANIMAL SINCE NO BODY HAS GIVEN ANY TOLERABLE ACCOUNT OF THEM ALL THE AU THORS HAVE SUPPOSD THEIR PARTS TO BE VERY FIXED VERY ACID AND VERY CORROSIVE DOCTOR GREW ALONE HAS FOUND THAT THEY ARE ALCALINE BUT HE WILL PLACE THEM AMONG TH E LAST AND WEAKEST OF THAT TRIBE THO I HOPETHAT THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNT SHALL BE MORE INSTRUCTIVE I RETIRED THEN WITH MY CANTHARIDES AND TO THE PUR POSE I TOLD YOU BEFORE ONLY IT IS VERY REMARKABLE THAT THOUGH I PROCEEDED IN THE USUAL WAY ON THE LIKE OCCASIONS THE WHOLE OPERATION WAS PERFORMED VERY SOON AND SO HASTILY THAT VERY LITTLE SALT STUCK TO THE NECK OF THE RETORT AND THE VOLATIL SALT SHOT IN MOST DE LIGHFUL CRYSTALS IN THE RECEIVER OF THE WHOLE EIGHT OUNCES167 OUNCES OF CANTHARIDES THERE WERE ONLY TWO OUNCES AND FIVE DRAMS LEFT AS A CAPUT MORTUUM IN THE RETORT WHEN THE LIQUOR CAME TO BE PURIFIED THE SMALLEST HEAT BROUGHT IT OVER SUDDAINLY OYL SALT AND SPIRIT SO THAT THEY COULD NOT BE PARTED TILL BY A REPEATED OPE RATION WITH BRICKDUST I MIXD THE SPIRIT WITH SALT OF WORMWOOD SPIRIT OF HARTSHORN AND SAL ARMONIACK BUT IT DID NOT FERMENT CONTRARY TO THE EXPECTATION OF MOST AUTHORS THEN I TURND IT OVER UPON SPIRIT OF VITRIOL WHERE IT DID FERMENT VERY STRONGLY AND YET BET TER WITH SPIRIT OF NITRE WITH WHICH ALSO I DID MIX THE SPIRITS OF SAL ARMONIACK AND HARTSHORN BUT THEY NEI THER FERMENTED SO LONG NOR WITH SO GREAT AN EBULLITION FROM WHENCE IT IS EVIDENT THAT IT IS NOT ONLY ALKALINE BUT A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN ANY ONE OF THESE I HAVE NOW MENTIONED SINCE I BEGAN THIS ENQUIRY I MET WITH A BOOK CAL LED A COMPLEAT COURSE OF CHIMISTRY IN WHICH THE AU THOR SUPPOSES THAT THE PARTS OF CANTHARIDES ARE VERY FIXD AND VERY CORROSIVE AND TO TRY WHAT THAT ANIMAL GIVESHE MIXES SPIRIT OF WINE AND NITRE A VERY STRANGE WAY TO TRY THE QUALITIES OF ANY SIMPLE AND MAKES A CONCLUSION WHICH MY MENTIONED EXPERIMENTS PROVE TO BE VERY FALSE AND VERY UNNATURAL BUT HE HAD AN END TO SERVE AND WOULD PUT UPON THE WORLD A VERY UNSAFE MEDICINE YET SINCE HE HAS BROUGHT US ON THAT SUBJECT AND WE ARE NOW AMONG CANTHARIDES CREATURES THAT HAVE SET ALL THE PHYSICK IN THIS TOWN IN A COMBUSTION OR FERMENT TO USE THE UNIVERSAL AND COMMON WORD TO LEAVE THE THING QUITE UNTOUCHT WOULD BE TO ACQUIESCE IN A GREA TER INDIFFERENCY THAN REALLY THERE IS AND YET YOU SEE THAT IT IS NOT DIRECTLY TO MY PURPOSE AND THEREFORE TO TAKE JUST MEASURES AND OBLIGE BOTH I SHALL GIVE SOME HINTS AND THAT ONLY TO STATE THE CASE WHICH IS MORE THAN HAS BEEN168 BEEN DONE IN THE WHOLE CONTROVERSY AND LEAVE THEM TO DISPUTE IN CLOSE QUARTERS AND NOT TO SKIRMISH SO MUCH AT RANDOM AS MANKIND IS APT TO DO WHICH PRO CEEDS FROM NOTHING MORE THAN A GREATER LOVE TO DISPUTE THAN TO KNOW AND I HOPE THAT THESE HINTS SHALL BE SUCH AS IF USD AS THE TOPICKS IN THE CONTRAVERSY WILL SOON PUT AN END TO IT AMONG THINKING AND SOBER PEOPLE AND FIRST I WOULD OBSERVE THAT THE GREAT ARGUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN USD ARE A FEW INSTANCES OF A FAR GREATER NUM BER OF AUTHORS THAT HAVE SPOKE TO THIS SUBJECT NEXT THESE ARGUMENTS ARE VERY OFTEN THE FLOURISHES THAT AU THORS MAKE IN DELIVERING OF THINGS WHICH IS A PRODI GIOUS FAULT FOR WHEN TRUTH IS NOT SPOKE IN AS FEW AND EXPRESS TERMS AS IS POSSIBLE IT GIVES GREAT OCCASION TO MISTAKE THIS IS NOT EVIDENT IN THIS CASE ONLY BUT IN EVERY THING OF THE SAME SORT AND WE SEE WHAT THE CHURCH WHAT THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION HAS SUFFERED IN THIS WAY AND THIRDLY THAT THERE IS NO OPINION SO ABSURD THAT HAS NOT A VOUCHER AND A PATRON SOME WHERE OR AT SOME TIME AND FOURTHLY WHAT CONSIDERATION HI STORICAL PROOF BEARS TO THAT OF A PRESENT FACT OR REA SON WELL THEN THIS IS THE NEXT THING THAT IS CHALLENGED THAT WE MAY SEE CANTHARIDES WHICH HAVE BEEN REPUTED POI SON NOW CORRECTED AND ARE NOT ONLY INNOCENT BUT PRODI GIOUS INSTRUMENTS OF HEALTH FOR THE CLEARING OF THIS FIRST SETTLE WHAT A POISON IS AND NEXT SINCE DEATH OR NO CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD IS ITS CONSEQUENCE WE MUST FIND AS MANY KINDS OF POI SONS AS THERE ARE WAYS OF STOPPING THE BLOODS MOTION WHICH IS EITHERBY ITS OWN RAREFACTION TO A DEGREE ITS COA GULATION OR LASTLY BY LETTING IT OUT IN SUCH A QUANTITY THAT THE REMAINING PART GIVES NOT ANIMAL ACTIONS AND AS ALL OR ANY OF THESE MAY BE SUDDEN OR DO PRODUCE THEIR EFFECTS IN TIME WE SHALL HAVE EVIDENT POISONING OR POI SONING169 SONING FOR A TIME OF WHICH WE HAVE MANY HISTORIES AGAIN IT MAY BE ASKT OF WHICH OF ALL THOSE CANTHARIDES ARE AND OF ALL I BELIEVE THEY MAY BE FOUND ENTIRELY OR MOST ESPECIALLY OF THE THIRD SORT THEN WE SHALL BE LED NATURALLY INTO THE NEXT STAGE WHICH IS TO BE SATISFIED IF THEY BE CORRECTED OR IN PLAIN ENGLISH IF THEY HAVE LEFT THEIR WOUNDING POWER AND THIS IS THE FACT OF WHICH WE MAY INFORM OUR SELVES BY APPLYING A PLAISTER OF CANTHARIDES SO CORRECTED TO A PLACE EXPOSED TO AIR AND THIS WILL SETTLE THE FACT OF COR RECTION AND IN CIRCUMSTANCES MUCH TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE CORRECTING SIDE BECAUSE THERE THE SKIN AND VESSELS ARE MUCH HARDER THAN THOSE TO BE MET WITH WITH IN THE BODY AND IF THEY BLISTER THEN MUCH MORE WHEN INTERNALLY GIVEN THE POSSIBILITY OF THEIR BEING CORRECTED AND OF THEIR BECOMING USEFUL MAY NOT BE DOUBTED OF BUT THEN IT IS OUR REASON IN THIS WAY THAT MUST BE JUDGE ADD TO ALL THIS THE COMMON OBSERVA TION THAT A COMMON BLISTER SOMETIMES MAKES BLOODY URINE AND COMPUTE WHAT QUANTITIES ENTER THE PLAISTER AND THEN WHAT QUANTITIES OF SMALL PARTS MAY BE SENT FROM THEM THAT ARE THUS MIXED NEXT CALCULATE WHAT PROBABLE DISTRIBUTION MAY BE MADE OF THESE PARTS TO THE KIDNIES AND THEN YOULL FIND THAT PARTS THAT ARE NEARER AND AS SUSCEPTIBLE MUST BE WOUNDED TOO AND PRODUCE ALL THE ILL EFFECTS THAT ARE SUPPOSED AND COMMONLY SEEN BUT IF ALL THIS CAN HAPPEN BY SO SMALL A QUANTITY OF THE POUDER THAT GOES TO THE PLAISTER AND IS CONFINED BY THE OTHER VISCID INGREDIENTS OF IT WHAT WHAT CAN BE THE CONSEQUENCE OF THIS POUDER WHEN IT IS TAKEN IN WARDLY AND IN SUBSTANCE BUT IT IS CORRECTED AND WE ARE TOLD WITH CAMPHIR THE MOST UNFIT CORRECTER SO FAR AS I CAN EXPECT IN REASON OR EVEN IMAGINE BUT STILL OUR REASON MAY BE FRAIL AND SO IT MAY AND REALLY IS B B SO170 SO TO A GREAT DEGREE BUT THEN TO HELP IT IN THE WAY I HAVE ALREADY PROPOSED I HAD TWO BLISTERS EACH OF THEM WITH CANTHARIDES AND ONE OF THEM WITH AS MUCH CAM PHIR AS CANTHARIDES I SAY I HAD TWO PLAISTERS APPLI ED AFTER THIS MANNER AND FOR THE REASONS I JUST NOW MEN TIONED BEHOLD WHAT WAS THE EVENT WHAT FOUND WE NEXT MORNING WE I MEAN MR BROOKES AN APOTHE CARY WHO MADE THEM AND MY SELF WE FOUND THAT BLI STER WHEREIN THE CANTHARIDES WERE MIXT TO HAVE QUITE AS GOOD EFFECTS AS THE OTHER WHERE THERE WAS NONE WHATS THE CONSEQUENCE THAT IS ALREADY DETERMIND VIZ THAT IF CANTHARIDES SAID TO BE CORRECTED MAKE A BLISTER WHEN APPLIED TO ANY EXTERNAL PART OF THE BODY THAT THEY ARE TO BE THOUGHT NOT TO BE CORRECTED WHICH IS THE CASE IN HAND BUT TO LEAVE THESE PARTICULARS TO BE SPOKE TO AT GREATER LENGTH BY THOSE WHO ARE CONCERNED I PRO CEED TO PROVE THE WAY OF A BLISTERS WORKING WHEN IT CURES A DELIRIUM AND A FEVER AS I AT FIRST PRO POSED THE PRESENT ENQUIRY IS PLAINLY THIS ASTONISHING PHAE NOMENON THAT IS SO OFTEN OBSERVED THAT THE  AND THE FEVER ARE ALMOST QUITE DEFEATED BY APPLYING A BLISTER AND IN THE SPACE OF SIX EIGHT OR TEN HOURS THE MOST SENSIBLE AND THE MOST VISIBLE EFFECTS OF APPLYING A BLISTER EVERY ONE OF US THAT ARE PHYSICIANS OR NOT OBSERVE TO BE NOTHING ELSE BUT THE BRINGING A GREAT QUANTITY OF WATRY SUBSTANCE BETWEEN THE SKIN AND SCARFSKIN AND THAT BY APPLYING TO THE PART THUS BLI STERED A PLAISTER MADE WITH CANTHARIDES OR THE LIKE SUBSTANCES THAT EXPERIENCE HAS TAUGHT US THAT THEY CAN BLISTER AND THEREFORE SINCE I HAVE SHEWED YOU THE MANY PARTICULARS T HAT ANY ONE THAT IS TO SPEAK TO BLI STERING IN GENERAL IS OBLIGED BY THE RULES OF PLAIN NESS171 NESS TO INSIST UPON AND THAT THEY SHOULD SWELL THIS DIS COURSE BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF THIS PLACE I SHALL ONLY SUPPOSE 1 THAT THERE ARE VERY MOBILE OR VOLATIL PARTS IN CANTHARIDES C THAT CAN BE DETERMINED INTO OUR FLESH WITH A FORCE SUFFICIENT TO MAKE THEIR WAY THOROW THE SIDES OF ANY VESSELS THAT ARE IN THE LINES OF THEIR DIRECTION SO LONG AND IN THAT PROPOR TION THAT THEIR IMPRESSD MOTION DOES CONTINUE 2 THAT ALL SORTS OF FLUID BODIES CONTAIND IN THE CA VITIES AND CHANNELS OF THESE VESSELS MAY BE TRANS MITTED ACCORDING TO THE CONDITIONS OF SEPARATI ON OF FLUID BODIES RUNNING IN VESSELS OF THAT SORT AND THE WIDENESS OF THE EMISSARIES MADE BY WOUND ING PARTICLES OF CANTHARIDES OR ANY SUCH LIKE BLI STERING SUBSTANCE NEXT I SHOULD PROCEED TO MAKE SOME SUPPOSITIONS FROM THE NATURE OF A FEVER AND A DELIRIUM THAT LOOK MORE PARTICULARLY TO AND MAY CONTRIBUTE IN THE DISCUS SING THE DIFFICULTY OF OUR PRESENT SUBJECT BUT BECAUSE ALL MY LEARNED HEARERS MAY NOT HAVE APPLIED THEMSELVES SO VERY MUCH TO THIS KIND OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY AND THAT I MAY NOT BE TOO UNEASY TO THEM BY NOT BEING UN DERSTOOD IT SEEMS TO BE VERY NECESSARY TO HINT SOME GENERAL THINGS ABOUT THEM THAT THEY MAY BE BETTER ABLE TO JUDGE IN THE PERFORMANCE F E V E R S IN RESPECT OF TIME EITHER REMAIN AFTER THE SAME MANNER FROM THE FIRST SICKENING TILL THE SICK PERSON IS FREED OF HIS DISEASE NOR NOT IF THE FIRST THEY ARE CALLD CONTINUD FEVERS BUT IF THE SICK PERSON CON TINUES EVIDENTLY IN A SICKLY WAY AND YET HAS GREAT RE LIEFS AND ALMOST FREE OF HIS ILLNESS THE FEVER IS SAID TO IN B B 2 TERMIT172 TERMIT OR THAT IT IS INTERMITTING NOW THAT WHATSO EVER A FEVER MAY BE THERE CAN BE NO FEVER BUT OF ONE OF THOSE TWO SORTS IS MOST EVIDENT THO THE FIRST WE SHALL HAVE RESPECT TO MOST ESPECIALLY IN OUR PRESENT DIS COURSE AGAIN SINCE PHYSICIANS NOT ONLY DISCOVER OTHER DISEA SES BUT FEVERS TOO BY THE PULSE AND ANY BODY AS WELL AS A PHYSICIAN IS APT TO SAY MY PULSE BEATS VERY QUICK I AM IN A FEVER THE QUICKNESS OF THE PULSE IN EVERY COMMON UNDERSTANDING IS THE FAULT OF THE PULSE AND THE PULSE CANNOT BE SO BUT BY THE FAULTINESS OF THE BLOOD EITHER IN QUANTITY QUALITY OR ITS MOTION NEITHER CAN IT OFFEND EITHER IN QUANTITY OR IN QUALITY BUT IT AFFECTS ITS MOTION AND SINCE THERE ARE NO SYMPTOMS THAT APPEAR IN ANY TIME OF A FEVER EITHER BEFORE IT AT THE TIME OR AFTER IT BUT WHAT NECESSARILY DEPEND ON THIS FAULTY MO TION THIS OBSERVABLE DEFECT OF ITS MOTION IS THE MOST EVIDENT SENSIBLE RULE OF A FEVER BOTH TO PHYSICIANS AND EVERY BODY ELSE AND IS NOT ONLY A SIGN OF BUT IS A FE VER IT SELF AND THEREFORE GIVE ME LEAVE TO SUPPOSE 3DLY THAT A FEVER IS AN UNIVERSALLY HEIGHT NED CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD AND THAT A DELIRIUM H E THAT UNCONNECTED INCOHERENT AND RIDICULOUS WAY OF IMA GINATION AND EXPRESSING OUR SELVES IN A FEVER IS ENTIRE LY THE EFFECT OF THIS GREATER MOTION WHOSE DISCOVERER IS A QUICK PULSE AND IN THE WAY I HAVE EXPLAIND IT IN THE 47 PAGE OF THE FIRST PART OF MY BOOK OF SEA SICKNESSES THESE THINGS BEING SUPPOSED THE QUESTION HAS QUITE ANOTHER FACE WHICH MIGHT BE STATED THIS WAY HOW WOUNDING BY INFERREDCANTHARIDESINFERRED MAKES OUR PULSE NOT SO QUICK AND CONSEQUENTLY OUR BLOOD TO HAVE A MORE SLOW AND NATURAL MOTION OUR CITED AUTHOR WILL HAVE THIS GREAT EFFECT WITH ALL ITS CIRCUMSTANCES TO  FROM THE PAIN173 PAIN THAT IS SOMETIMES MADE IN THE TIME THE BLISTER IS A MAKING OTHERS THAT SOME OF THE PARTICLES OF THE CANTHARIDES THAT MIX WITH THE BLOOD DO INDUCE THIS QUIET BY A PECULIAR SORT OF FERMENTATION THEY MAKE IN THE BLOOD I THINK THE NAMING OF THESE OPINIONS IS ENOUGH TO SHOW HOW UNSATISFYING ACCOUNTS WE HAVE OF THEM THAT PAIN VERY OFTEN BRINGS A FEVER IS HIS OWN AND THE OPINION OF ALL THE WORLD AND I THINK IF IT IS TO BE IMAGIND THAT SO CONSTANT A CAUSE CAN PRODUCE AN EFFECT SO UNLIKE THAT WHICH DOES MOST COMMONLY ATTEND IT WE SHOULD HAVE HAD A BETTER ACCOUNT OF THE ACCIDENT AND SINCE THAT IS NOT DONE THE FALSITY AND PRECARIOUS PUT TING ON OUR UNDERSTANDING IS TOO EVIDENT TO REQUIRE ANY FURTHER CONSIDERATION THE OTHER IS AS PRECARIOUS AND QUITE AS UNSATISFYING THO NOT SO FALSE IF THE MATTER WAS WELL ACCOMMODATED AND MADE THE SUBJECT OF OUR UNDERSTANDING ALL THE WORLD IS FULL OF FERMENTING AND EVERY THING IS SAID TO FERMENT AND YET WHAT FERMENTATION IS AND WHAT NE CESSITY THERE IS FOR IT IN OUR BODIES ESPECIALLY THESE FERMENTING PEOPLE THAT TALK SO MUCH OF IT HAVE NOT YET SO MUCH AS TOLD US THAT BY FERMENTATION BODIES CHANGE THEIR MOTION IN ITS DEGREE DIRECTION C IS MOST CERTAIN AND REALLY HERE IS A MOST CONSIDERABLE ALTERATI ON IN THE BLOODS MOTION AS WE ARE INFORMD BY OUR PULSE AND THEREFORE IT MIGHT BE SUPPOSED THAT IT DID FERMENT BUT THEN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A MOST CONSI DERABLE AND USEFUL ENQUIRY TO KNOW HOW THE PARTICULARS OF CANTHARIDES DO FERMENT AND THE WAYS OF AFFECTION TO MAKE THIS GREAT CHANGE I HAVE SHOWN IN ANOTHER PLACE THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A CHYMICAL FERMEN TATION IN OUR BLOOD AND THAT FROM HINTS OF AN EMINENT MEMBER OF THIS SOCIETY AND PERHAPS THE GREATEST CHY MIST THAT EVER LIVD AND NOW THE SEQUEL OF MY DISCOURSE174 DISCOURSE WILL PROVE THAT THIS GREAT CHANGE IS MADE WITHOUT ANY FERMENTATION OR ANY KIND OF FERMENTA TION IN THE MOST TOLERABLE AND SOBER SENSE I DO NOT NAME A THIRD OPINION FROM THE QUANTITY OF LYMPHA THAT IS NOW SEPARATED FROM THE BLOOD BECAUSE MOST OF OUR MODERN PHYSICIANS DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT IS A WEAK CAUSE FOR SO GREAT AN EFFECT AND IT SHALL APPEAR BY AND BY THAT WHATSOEVER SO GREAT A DISCHARGE MIGHT PERFORM IN THE SAME WAY WE CONSIDER OTHER EVA CUATIONS THAT YET IT CANNOT ACCOUNT FOR THE CURE IN SO SHORT A TIME NO MORE THAN THEY SO HERE ARE CON SIDERATIONS TAKEN FROM THE SOLID PARTS BY MAKING PAIN OF SOME BENEFIT FROM THE LIQUORS IN THE VESSELS BY FERMENTATION AND THE LIQUORS OUT OF THE VESSELS BY THE DISCHARGED LYMPHA AND YET NOT ONE OF THEM TO ANSWER THE PHAENOMENON EVEN SUPPOSING THEY WERE SPOKE TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE HERE SEEMS TO BE ALL THE EXACTNESS IMAGINABLE AND EVEN NOTHING LEFT LET US STATE THE QUESTION AGAIN A DELIRIUM WHICH IS THE EF FECT OF THIS QUICK PULSE WHICH IS CURD BY THE WOUNDS OF CANTHARIDES OR A BLISTER THE PULSE IS NOTHING BUT THE SIDE OF AN ARTERY THAT IS DISTENDED BY A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF BLOOD THAT IS DETER MINED THOROW ITS CAVITY BY A CERTAIN MOTION AT EVERY TIME THE HEART IS CONTRACTED AND THAT TOUCHES AND BEATS UP OUR FINGER WHEN WE LAY IT ON A PLACE WHERE WE MAY BE SENSIBLE OF THIS AFFECTION IN THE ARTERY WE SAY THIS PULSE IS MORE FREQUENT NOT SO MUCH THAT IT BEATS OFTNER THAN ANY OTHER BODIES BUT THAT IT BEATS QUICKER IN THE SAME PERSON WHEN HE IS SAID TO HAVE A FEVER THAN BEFORE WHEN HE WAS REPUTED TO BE IN PERFECT HEALTH SO THAT A PHYSICIAN IS OBLIGD TO KNOW THE NATURAL PULSE OF EVERY PERSON BESORE HE CAN JUDGE BY THE PULSE THAT ANY ONE IS SICK AND HOW THAT MAY BE DONE I HAVE SHOWD AT LENGTH IN A BOOK SOME TIME AGO HOWSOEVER IN175 IN THIS OUR CASE THE PULSE IS QUICKER AND THERE IS NO PULSE BUT WHEN THE HEART IS CONTRACTED AND THE HEART BEING A MUSCLE AND CONTRACTED AT EVERY PULSE THE HEART IS EITHER THE CHIEF OR ONLY CAUSE THAT DETERMINES THIS LIQUOR THAT DISTENDS AND STRETCHES THE SIDES OF AR TERIES AND MAKES A PULSE OR A VERY EXTRAORDINARY MEA SURE OF SUCH DISTENTIONS BUT AS I SAID IT HAS THE GREA TEST SHARE IN PROPELLING THE BLOOD ROUND THE WHOLE BODY IN RESPECT OF THE HELP OF THE ARTERIES WHICH THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO GIVE BY THEIR RESTITUTION AFTER THEIR EXTRA ORDINARY DISTENTION BE IT HOW IT WILL BOTH THEIR ACTI ONS ARE BY CONTRACTION THO AFTERWARDS I TAKE NO NO TICE OF THAT OF THE ARTERIES AND NO CONTRACTION IN MUS CLES WAS EVER SUPPOSED BY ANY SOBER MAN TO BE PER FORMD BUT BY AN INFLUX OF SPIRITS INTO THE FIBRES OF THE MUSCLES SO CONTRACTED SO THAT NOW OUR QUESTION CHANGES THUS HOW WOUNDING BY CANTHARIDES MAKES THE CONTRACTION OF OUR HEART WEAKER THE CONTRACTION OF MUSCLES AND CONSEQUENTLY OF THE HEART BEING BY THE SPIRITS THAT FLOW INTO THEM AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE THEREFORE WHATSOEVER WEAKENS THE CONTRACTION OF ANY MUSCLE SUPPOSE THE HEART MUST EITHER BE SUCH A THING THAT CAN HINDER THE SEPA RATION OF THESE SPIRITS OR INTERCEPT THEM IN THEIR CHANNEL OF CONVEYANCE TO THAT MUSCLE AFTER THEY ARE SEPARATED THE SPIRITS ARE KNOWN BY ANATOMICAL EXPERIMENTS TO BE SEPARATED FROM THE BLOOD IN THE BRAIN NOW WHAT SOEVER HINDERS THE SEPARATION OF THE SPIRITS FROM THE BLOOD MUST EITHER HINDER THAT RAREFACTION OF THE BLOOD THAT COMES BY BEING BROKE DOWN INTO SMALL PARTS AND MAKES THEM SPIRITS IN THEIR PROPER PLACE OR THE BLOOD OF THAT FINENESS THAT IS NECESSARY FOR IT TO BE PERSPIRED H E A BODY THAT AFFECTS THE BLOOD SO AS NOT TO SEPARATE SPIRITS MUST BE OF A NATURE TO MAKE ITS PARTS MORE COMPACT IN176 IN THEIR CONTRACT TO HAVE THEIR CONTRACT WITH A GREA TER NISUS AND CONSEQUENTLY TO HAVE ITS PARTS LESS SE PARABLE THE NEXT WAY IS BY AFFECTING ITS MOTION SO THAT IT DISCHARGES GREAT QUANTITIES OUT OF THE BLOOD BY THESE MEANS THE QUANTITY OF THE BLOOD BEING LESSER IT GIVES FEWER SPIRITS WHEN IT IS BROKE DOWN AND IS NOT SO CA PABLE TO BE SO COMMINUTED BECAUSE OF THE PARTS OF BLOOD NOT PRESSING SO MUCH ONE UPON THE OTHER IN THE WHOLE COURSE AND TIME OF CIRCULATION OR THIRDLY BY SOME MEANS THAT AFFECT THE PARTS THAT TRANSMIT THESE SPIRITS SO THAT NOW NO SPIRITS CAN BE SE PARATED OR IN A SMALLER QUANTITY IF WE APPLY THE WOUNDING BY CANTHARIDES OR ITS EF FECTS TO ALL THESE WAYS WE SHALL FIND THAT IN THE FIRST CON SIDERATION THE LYMPHA SEPARATED IN A BLISTER IS NOTHING AT ALL CONCERND AND THAT THE STUPENDOUS EFFECT MIGHT POSSIBLY BE PRODUCED WITHOUT ANY SUCH DISCHARGE BUT IF YOU GO FURTHER AND SUPPOSE THE CANTHARIDES GOT INTO THE MASS OF THE BLOOD WITHOUT ANY GATHERING OF WA TERS YOU CANNOT SUPPOSE THAT THE PARTS OF CANTHARIDES THAT ARE SO SUBTIL SO ALKALIN AND WHICH BY OTHER EX PERIMENTS MAKE THE BLOOD SO FLUID CAN BE ANY GREAT ENEMIES TO THE RAREFACTION OF THE BLOOD WHICH MAKES SPIRITS AND FITS THEM TO BE SEPARATED OR ANY CONSIDE RABLE INSTRUMENT IN LESSENING THE RAREFACTION WHICH IS REQUISITE AND ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY BY THE FIRST CONDITION NEITHER ARE THEY IN THEIR NATURE FIT INSTRUMENTS FOR THE THIRD BESIDES THAT WE FIND NO SIGNS AND NO MARKS OF SUCH AN INTERRUPTIONEITHER IN THE BRAIN OR ANY WHERE ELSE THE SECOND CONDITION FOR HINDERING SO GREAT A PREPA RATION AND SO GREAT A SEPARATION OF SPIRITS IS THE EFFECT OF ALL EVACUATIONS SO THAT BY THE BY EVACUATION IS THE GREAT INDICATION FOR THE CURE OF A FEVER AND IS A GREAT DEAL177 DEAL MORE EVIDENT THAN ANY SUPPOSED POISON OR MALIG NITY SUPPOSED TO BE DISCHARGED BY SUPPOSED ALEXIPHAR MICKS THAT ARE THEIR SUPPOSED ANTIDOTES YET THIS EFFECT BY AN EVACUATION IS GRANTED AND BY THE WAY OF WORK ING WILL BE FOUND UNABLE TO DISCUSS ALL THE PHAENOMENA IN DOING IT IN SO SHORT A TIME IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE OF THE DISCHARGE OF LYMPHA BY A BLISTER WHAT IS SAID OF EVA CUATIONS OF OTHER KINDS AND IN A PROPER PROPORTION WHAT IS SAID OF THE EVACUATION BY PERSPIRATION WHICH IS TEN TIMES THE WHOLE NATURAL EVACUATIONS IT IS OBSERVA BLE TO THIS PURPOSE WHAT I SAID P 108 OF THE FORE MENTIONED BOOK WHEN I SPOKE ABOUT THE VAST QUANTITY OF PERSPIRATION IN A NATURAL AND UNPROVOKD WAY LI CET SIT MAXIMUM HOC MODO LIQUORUM DISPENDIUM AP PRIME TAMEN UTILIS EST SECRETIO HAEC AD VALITUDINEM CON SERVANDAM SI ENIM CORPUS NOSTRUM POROSUM NON ESSET AC PARTES DE CORPORE DICTO NON DIMITTERET MODO FEBRICITARE NOS SEMPER OPORTERET

TUNT C BUT THIS CONTACT THIS CONDITION OF MOTION BEING CHANGD THERE IS A LESSER NISUS A LESSER SEPARATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF SMALL PARTS TO THE HEART AS WE DE SIRE BUT I SAY THIS IS GRANTED TO BE THE EFFECT OF TIME OF A LONGER TIME THAN IN THE STATE OF OUR PRO POSITION AND WHOSOEVER IS ABLE TO LOOK PARTICULAR LY INTO THE PROGRESSION HE WILL BE FURTHER CONVIN CED THUS WE HAVE SEEN BY LOOKING INTO THESE CONDITIONS AS NEARLY AS THIS PLACE WILL ALLOW THAT THE CANTHARIDES CANNOT CONDENSE THE BLOOD OR STOP THAT RAREFACTION AND THAT CONTRITION THAT DISPOSE TO THE SEPARATION OF SPIRITS IN THEIR PROPER PLACE OR WHICH IS THE SAME THING THAT THEY DO NOT PREVENT A MORE FREQUENT CONTRACTION OF THE C C HEART178 HEART OR A QUICK PULSE AS WE WERE OBLIGED TO IN QUIRE THE THIRD IS EVIDENT AND SO SHOULD THE SE COND BY A LITTLE PROOF IF IT WERE NOT GRANTED BEFORE HAND AND MAY BE EASILY UNDERSTOOD BY WHAT I DID SAY IN ALL THIS I HAVE NOT SUPPOSED OR ASSUMD ANY THING BUT WHAT IS GRANTED AS SELFEVIDENT AMONG PHYSICIANS THO THE PROVING OF THIS IN A MORE RIGOROUS WAY SHOULD BE STILL MORE SATISFYING THO PERHAPS LESS PLEASING HOW SOEVER I HOPE THAT THE THING HAS ALL THE POSSIBLE PROOF IT IS CAPABLE OF BUT SINCE A BLISTER DOES NOT INFERREDHINDERINFERRED THE PREPARING AND SEPARATING OF SPIRITS EITHER IN RESPECT OF THE LIQUOR OUT OF WHICH THEY ARE SEPARATED OR THE PLACE BY WHICH THEY ARE SEPARATED AND BOTH SPIRITS ARE SEPARATED FROM THE BLOOD AND TRANSMITTED THOROW THE GLANDS OF THE BRAIN INTO THE NERVES AND BY CONSE QUENCE THE HEART STILL RETAINS ITS FREQUENT AND VIOLENT CON TRACTION NOTWITHSTANDING OF A BLISTER AND IN DESPITE OF ALL THESE WOUNDS WE HAVE A QUICKER PULSE THAN NATURALLY OR WE HAVE A FEVER LET US ONCE MORE ENQUIRE IF A BLISTER THAT MAKES SMALL WOUNDS AND CURES A FEVER IN A SHORT TIME CAN PRODUCE THIS ITS EFFECT IN THE ONLY WAY WE HAVE LEFT US AND THAT IS BY WOUNDING THAT CHANNEL THAT CAR RIES THOSE SPIRITS THAT CONTRACT THE HEART GIVE US A QUICK PULSE AND A FEVER WITH ALL ITS ATTENDANTS DELI RIUM C IF THIS SUPPOSITION IS ALLOWED OF NO DOUBT BUT THAT A NY THE LEAST QUANTITY OF ANIMAL SPIRITS LET OUT BY SUCH WOUNDS IN A VERY LITTLE TIME WILL PROPORTIONABLY WEA KEN THE HEARTS CONTRACTION AND GIVE US A SLOWER PULSE WHICH IS ALL WE WANT AND WHICH IS MORE THIS SLOWER CONTRACTION WHICH IS KNOWN BY OUR SLOWER PULSE DE TERMINING THE WHOLE CIRCULATING BLOOD WITH LESS FORCE THE PARTS OF BLOOD DO NOT  THEMSELVES SO MUCH AS WHEN179 WHEN THE MOTION WAS MORE RAPID AND BY CONSEQUENCE THERE IS NOT SUCH A DISPOSITION FOR SEPARATING SMALL PARTS IN THE BRAIN THAT AFTERWARDS THEY MAY BE DERIVED THO ROW THE NERVES INTO THE HEART BUT MOREOVER THE LESSER MOTION CONTINUING FOR SOME LITTLE TIME OR TWO OR THREE MINUTES IN A VELOCITY SOMETHING LIKE OUR NATU RAL MOTION ALL THE SECRETIONS WHICH ARE PERFORMED IN SUCH LIKE DEGREES OF VELOCITY WILL AGAIN BEGIN TO BE DONE AS BEFORE AND THAT THIS MUST BE IS EVIDENT BE CAUSE I HAVE ALREADY PROVD THAT THE DIFFERENT VELOCI TIES OF THE BLOODS MOTION DID MAKE THE VARIETY OF SECRE TIONS WHETHER THE PASSAGES OR PORES WERE UNIFORM OR OF IRREGULAR AND VARIOUS FIGURES AND BUT JUST NOW WE SAW IT EVIDENTLY THAT EVACU ATIONS WERE THE GENUIN WAYS OF CURING FEVERS C THO THEIR WAY WAS NOT ANSWERABLE TO EVERY PART OF THIS DIFFI CULTY HERE IS A NOTABLE DISCOVERY IF WE CAN PUT LITTLE E MISSARIES ON THE NERVE THAT IS MORE ESPECIALLY CONCERND IN THE HEARTS CONTRACTION WE SHALL HINDER ANY PREPARA TION IN THE BLOOD FOR SEPARATING SO GREAT A NUMBER OF SPIRITS WHICH IS ONE GREAT REQUISITE NAY WE SHALL MAKE SECRETIONS OF THAT SORT AND IN THAT WAY AS IN TIME OF HEALTH AND IF THEY BE BUT SECRETIONS THE CON TRITING PARTS AND THOSE TO BE BROKE DOWN SHALL HAVE NO SUCH A CLOSE CONTACT AND THEREFORE THAT EXTRAORDINARY QUANTITY OF SPIRITS SHALL NOT BE PREPARD IN THE BLOOD AND IF THEY ARE NOT PREPARD THEY CANNOT BE SEPARATED FROM IT OR A MODERATE QUANTITY OF ANIMAL SPIRITS SHALL BE CONVEYED INTO THE MUSCULAR FIBRES OF THE HEART OR AGAIN WHICH IS THE SAME THING ITS CONTRACTION SHALL BE NATURAL OR VERY LIKE C BUT MORE WONDERFUL ALL THIS MAY BE DONE OR BEGIN TO BE DONE IN TWO OR THREE MINUTES AND THEREFORE OUR PROPOSITION MAY BE THAT WOUNDING BY CANTHARIDES MAY C C 2 CURE180 CURE A DELIRIUM NOT ONLY IN SIX EIGHT OR TEN HOURS BUT IN ONE TWO OR THREE MINUTES WHICH IS VERY ASTO NISHING IF I HAD EXPLAIND  IN GENERAL YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN THAT THE WOUNDING PARTS MIGHT HAVE REACHED THEIR STAGE IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND THAT IS ALL I SUPPOSE MORE THAN THE THREE MINUTES JUST NOW ASSIGND BUT HOW SHALL WE WOUND THEIR CONVEYING NERVES HOW SHALL WE APPLY A BLISTER THAT ITS PARTS MAY AFFECT IS NOW THE GREAT AND ONLY QUESTION THAT REMAINS TO DO THIS YOU MUST BRING INTO YOUR MEMORY WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN IN DIFFLECTIONS THAT THIS EIGHTH PAIR OF NERVES WHICH SERVES FOR THE HEARTS CONTRACTION HAS ITS RISE FROM THE SIDES OF THE MEDULLA OBLONGATA BEHIND THE PROCESSUS AN NULARIS BY SEVERAL THREADS WHICH JOYN TOGETHER AND GO OUT BY THE SAME HOLE THAT THE SINUS LATERALES DIS CHARGE THEMSELVES INTO THE JUGULARS AND SINCE THE U NION BY THE ATLAS IS NOT SO FIRM AND COMPACT AS IN THE OTHER VERTEBRAE IT IS EVIDENT THAT THERE IS NO EXTRAOR DINARY HINDRANCE WHY SOME OF THESE WOUNDING PARTS MAY NOT COME AT THAT NERVE BUT IF YOU REFLECT AGAIN THAT THIS NERVE OR CONSIDERABLE BRANCHES OF IT RUN SU PERFICIALLY ENOUGH ON THE NECK AND BY CONSEQUENCE GIVES US LESS DIFFICULTY TO APPREHEND HOW SOME OF THEM ARE WOUNDED AND TO UNDERSTAND HOW THESE MIRACULOUS EF FECTS DO HAPPEN AND ARE PRODUCED OR IT IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE SMALL PARTS OF CANTHARIDES CAN WOUND THE EIGHTH PAIR OR BY WOUNDING ITS BRANCHES DERIVE FROM THE NERVE IT SELF AND LESSEN THE MOTION OF ITS LIQUOR OR TIS NOT HARD TO APPREHEND HOW WOUNDING BY CANTHA RIDES HINDERS THE DISPOSITION OF SEPARATING SPIRITS AND IN TERCEPTS THEM IN THEIR WAY TO THE HEART HOW THEY MAKE ITS WEAKER CONTRACTION AND A SLOWER PULSE OR AGAIN IT IS EVIDENT HOW THE SMALL EMISSARIES MADE IN THIS WAY CAN181 CAN CURE A FEVER AND A INFERREDDELIRIUMINFERRED IN A SHORTER TIME THAN IS SUPPOSED IN THE PROPOSITION AS I INTENDED TO SHOW BUT TO PREVENT OUR MALICIOUS ENEMIES THAT CONFESS WE TALK LIKE MEN OF WIT BUT NOTHING FOR THE USE OF MAN OR PRACTISE OH THE GREAT POWER AND PREROGA TIVE OF A DEFECT OF UNDERSTANDING IS IT NOT REASON THAT GUIDES THAT EXPERIENCE THEY PRETEND TO  IS IT NOT CERTAIN THAT THERE CAN BE NO EXPERIENCE WITHOUT A SUIT ABLE USE OF REASON TO COLLECT CIRCUMSTANCES OR WHY DID A GREAT MAN COMPLAIN OF EXPERIENTIA BEING FALLAX IS NOT THIS AN UNREASONABLE TASK TO BE PUT TO DEFEND GOOD SENSE GOOD SENSE WILL DEFEND ITS OWN CAUSE WITH PEO PLE OF SENSE BUT WHERE ARE THEY HOW SMALL A NUMBER ARE THEY TO THE GROSS OF MANKIND WILL NOT A COMMON ALMANACKMAKER PERSWADE THE MOST OF THE WORLD THAT HE CAN FORETELL AN ECLIPSE BETTER THAN SUCH AN ONE WHO PERHAPS CALCULATED THESE TABLES FROM WHENCE HE HAS HIS PREDICTION AND WHAT I SAY OF HIM MAY BE INSTANCED IN EVERY THING ELSE BUT I SAY TO LET THEM SEE THAT THO THIS DISCOURSE HAS MORE OF HUMANE FRAILTY THAN ANY THING SAID AMONG YOU ILL LET THEM SEE THAT THE NECESSARY COROLLARIES FROM THIS DISCOURSE ARE VERY PRACTICABLE AND COULD LET THEM SEE THAT MOST OF THEIR POSITIONS ARE MOST INCONSISTENT NOT ONLY WITH WHAT I HAVE SAID BUT EVEN WITH WHAT THEY SAY THEM SELVES FIRST IF I HAD SPOKE TO VESICATION IN GENERAL I SHOULD HAVE SHOWN YOU THAT NOT ONLY THE OPERATION OF A BLISTER IS GREAT AND SUDDEN BUT OF MIGHTY CONSE QUENCE I SHOULD HAVE MADE IT EVIDENT HOW BLISTERS MAY DE RIVE ROUZE PEOPLE THAT ARE STUPID AS WELL AS DEPRESS TOO GREAT AN AGILITY OF SPIRITS I182 I SHOULD HAVE SHOWN YOU HOW THEY MAKE STRANGU RIES AND HOW THAT THO THEY DO ALL THIS AND MUCH MORE YET BY DISSIPATING OF VAST QUANTITIES OF SPIRITS AND BY GREAT DISCHARGES OF HUMIDITY THEY MAY AND REALLY DO SUCH MISCHIEF THAT CAN NEITHER BE AVOIDED NOR REPAIRED BY ALL OUR MEDICINES OR PEARLED DRAUGHTS BUT TO COME NEARER OUR PURPOSE TIS MOST EVIDENT THAT IF THE WOUNDING OF THIS NERVE OR A BRANCH BE SO ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR CURING A DELIRIUM AND A FEVER THAT WHATSOEVER MISCHIEF THE APPLYING VAST NUMBERS OF BLISTERS OVER ALL THE BODY MAY DO YET THE MAIN END IS NEGLECTED IF YOU FORGET A LARGE ONE HIGH ON THE NOP OF THE NECK SECONDLY THAT IF THERE IS NO VESI CATION AFTER THE LAYING ON A STRONG PLAISTER IT NECESSA RILY ESTABLISHES A NEW AND PRODIGIOUS HARDNESS IN THE SKIN AND VESSELS A THICKNING OF THE BLOOD FOR A FURTHER TOTAL STOP BUT NOTHING OF THE BLISTERS CHUSING TO GRAP PLE FIRST WITH THE SPIRITS MANY INFERENCES OF THAT SORT MAY BE MADE BUT I HAVE ALREADY IM AFRAID TRIED PATIENCE TOO FAR IV OF

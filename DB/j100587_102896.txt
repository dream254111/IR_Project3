WM COWPER F R S CONCERNING THE CURE OF AN APOSTEMATION OF THE LUNGS S I R ACCORDING TO YOUR DESIRE I SEND YOU THE CASE OF MRS JANE TERRY NIECE TO MR FOWKES IN CURSITORSALLY NEAR LINCOLNSINNAND THANK YOU FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE IN HER CURE TO WHICH YOUR EXTRAORDINARY SKILL IN YOUR PROFESSION VERY MUCH CONTRIBUTED I DOUBT NOT BUT AN ACCOUNT OF HER FROM THE FIRST TIME I WAS CONCERNED WITH HER WILL BE ACCEPTABLE TO YOU I KNEW HER SOME TIME BEFORE SHE FELL ILL OF THE SMALL POX WHICH WAS IN MAY 1701 SHE WAS ABOUT 18 YEARS OLD OF A FRESH COMPLEXION AND PRETTY FLESHY HER RELATIONS APPREHENDING SHE MIGHT HAVE THE SMALL POX REMOVED HER TO A NURSES HOUSE WHERE SHE HAD THE DISTINCT SORT VERY KINDLY HER CASE PROCEEDED SO VERY WELL AS THEY CONCEIVED THAT NO PHYSICIAN WAS CALLED TO HER TILL THEY BEGAN TO SHELL ONLY FOR SOME DAYS BEFORE SHE HAD A LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN HER BREATHING WHICH GRADUALLY INCREASED TILL SHE BEGAN TO RAISE BLOOD WHICH WAS ABOUT THE 7TH DAY FROM THEIR FIRST AP PEARING THIS RAISING OF BLOOD WAS ACCOMPANIED WITH THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IT HAD INCREASD EVERY DAY FOR 3 DAYS BEFORE I SAW HER SHE COUGHD AND BROUGHT UP A VISCOUS PHLEGM SUCH AS OUR PATIENTS VOMIT WHEN THEIR STOMACHS ARE VERY FOUL ONLY AS MEER PHELGM IS WHITE THIS WAS ALL OF IT AS RED AS BLOOD IT WAS NOT STREAKD WITH BLOOD OR HAD A MIX TURE OF WHITE PHLEGM WITH IT BUT WAS SO DEEPLY COLOURD THAT IT SEEMD TO BE ALL BLOOD ONLY IT WOULD NOT FLOW AS BLOOD1373 BLOOD DOES WHILST IT IS HOT NOR DID IT COAGULATE AS BLOOD DOES WHEN IT IS COLD BUT HUNG FROM THE BASONS WHEN IT WAS POURD OUT AS VOMITED PHLEGM DOES AND IN THIS IT DIFFERD FROM ALL THE BLOODY EXPECTORATIONS I HAVE SEEN EXCEPTING MR JONES AT MYN HEER MEYSTERSS IN KENSINGTONWHO COUGHD THE SAME BLOODY COLOURD PITUITA BUT IN MUCH LESS QUANTITY FOR MRS TERRY RAISD ABOVE A PINT IN 24 HOURS FOR SOME DAYS AND THO A LESS YET A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY AFTERWARDS MRS TERRYS AFFORDED A VERY STRONG SMELL BUT MR JONESS HAD NO ODOUR AFTER SOME WEEKS SHE RECOVERD REGAIND HER FLESH WHICH WAS WASTED IN HER ILLNESS THE MENSES RETURND AND SHE CONTINUED VERY WELL FROM JULY TILL NEAR CHRISTMAS IN JANUARY I WAS CARRIED TO SEE HER AT MR WOOLESTONS THE QUEENSHEAD TAVERN AT QUEENHITHE AND SHE GAVE THIS AC COUNT OF HER SELF THAT ABOUT 3 WEEKS BEFORE CHRISTMAS SHE PERCEIVD HER SELF A LITTLE SHORT BREATHD WHICH INCREASD DAILY WITH A FULLNESS AND WEIGHT IN HER LEFT SIDE THAT SHE LAY WELL ON THE LEFT SIDE BUT WHEN SHE TURND TO LYE ON HER RIGHT SHE FELT AS IF A WEIGHT FELL FROM THE LEFT TO THE RIGHT SIDE WHICH GAVE HER A SHORTNESS OF BREATH AND MADE HER COUGH THUS IT CONTINUED INCREASING TILL CHRISTMAS WHEN SHE BEGAN TO RAISE A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF STRONG STINKING PUS SHE SAID SHE EAT HER VICTUALS WELL ENOUGH ALL THIS TIME AND WAS NOT FEVERISH AT FIRST SHE WAS UNDER THE CARE OF ANOTHER PHY SICIAN WHO TOLD HER RELATIONS WHEN THEY DESIRED HIS JUDG MENT OF THE DISEASE AND ITS EVENT THAT IT WAS AN ULCER IN HER LUNGS AND HE BELIEVD INCURABLE UPON WHICH THEY AGAIN COMMITTED HER TO MY CARE WHEN I SAW HER WHICH WAS TO WARDS THE MIDDLE OF JANUARY 1701 SHE RAISED A CONSIDERA BLE QUANTITY AND OFTEN OF STINKING OFFENSIVE PUS WHICH WAS AS FLUID AS THE PUS OF OTHER PARTS HER FLESH WAS A LITTLE A BATED BUT SHE WAS AT NO TIME FEVERISH SHE EAT AND SLEPT PRETTY WELL AND HAD THE CATAMENIA DULY I PRESCRIBED SUCH MEDICINES AS ABATED THAT PURULENT EXPECTORATION SEVERAL TIMES AND SHE OFTEN GAVE ME HOPES OF HER RECOVERY SHE 1380 CONTINUING TO HAVE THE MENSES REGULARLY AND BEING STILL FREE FROM AN HECTICK BUT UPON EVERY LITTLE   AGAIN RAISED THAT FETID PUS IN A CONSIDERABLE  SHE GE NERALLY CONTINUED PRETTY FREE FROM COUGHING SEVERAL HOURS TOGETHER TILL SHE PERCEIVD SOMETHING OF A  IN HER BREAST WHICH WOULD OBLIGE HER TO COUGH AND AFTER SHE HAD ONCE BEGAN TO RAISE SHE COULD NOT CEASE TILL SHE HAD BROUGHT UP TWO SPOONFULS OR MORE OF THAT FETID PUS THIS SHE DID CHIEFLY IN THE MORNING AFTERNOON AND AT NIGHT I DID APPREHEND SHE HAD AN ABSCESS IN THE LEFT LOBE OF HER LUNGSAND MADE HER LYE UPON THE BEDWITH HER HEAD REACH ING TO THE CHAMBER FLOOR LEANING UPON HER LEFT ARM IN THIS POSTURE SHE COULD AT ANY TIME AFTER A LITTLE COUGH SET THE PUS A RUNNING OUT OF HER MOUTH AS YOU HAVE SEEN SE VERAL TIMES TILL THE WHOLE WHICH WAS THEREIN CONTAIND WAS DISCHARGD THEN SHE WOULD GET UPAND SEEM TO BE AS WELL AS ANOTHER PERSON TILL IT WAS ALMOST FILLD AGAIN IN THE BEGINNING OF MAY LAST THOSE EXCELLENT PHYSICIANS DR TORLESSE AND DR PITTS FAVOURD ME WITH THEIR KIND ASSISTANCE THEY SAW HER LYE IN THE POSTURE I HAVE DESCRIBD AND SAW MORE THAN 2 SPOONFULS OF STINKING PUS OR CORRUPTION RUN OUT OF HER MOUTH AFTER A LITTLE COUGHING THIS MADE IT SO APPARENT THAT THERE WAS AN ULCER IN HER LUNGS THAT THEY IMMEDIATE LY APPROVD OF WHAT I HAD BEFORE PROPOSED TO HER AND HER RELATIONS OF THE NECESSITY OF MAKING AN APERTITION IN HER SIDE WHERE WE COULD APPREHEND THE LUNGS GREW TO IT FOR THAT SEEMD UNQUESTIONABLE FROM THE POSTURE OF DISCHARGING IT AND SOME LITTLE PAIN SHE FEIT IN HER SIDE THE GREAT O PINION HER RELATIONS JUSTLY ENTERTAIND OF THESE GENTLE MEN BEING NOT ONLY MEN OF GREAT LEARNING PARTICULARLY IN THEIR OWN PROFESSION BUT ALSO OF MANY YEARS PRA CTICE DR TORLESSE HAVING BEEN ALMOST 30 YEARS SINCE CHOSEN PHYSICIAN TO ST THOMASS HOSPITAL AND DR PITTS TO ST BARTHOLOMEWS SEVERAL YEARS AGO MADE THEM REA DILY CONSENT TO WHAT WAS PROPOSED AND DESIRE YOUR ASSISTANCE 1381 ASSISTANCE BEING NO STRANGERS TO YOUR GREAT ABILITY BOTH IN ANATOMY AND SURGERY ABOUT A WEEK BEFORE THE PUS HAD BEGUN AGAIN TO ENCREASE AND THE DAY BEFORE THESE GENTLEMEN SAW HER SHE WAS TAKEN IN THE AFTERNOON WITH A CHILNESS AFTER WHICH HER PULSE BECAME A LITTLE QUICKER AND SHE A LITTLE FEVERISH AS I BELIEVE YOU REMEMBER SHE WAS WHEN YOU APPLIED THE CAUSTICK THIS FEVERISH STATE ENCREASED EVERY DAYAND AFTER SOME DAYS A RASH APPEARDWHICH LASTED ABOUT 14 DAYS BEFORE IT WAS QUITE GOT OFF AND LEFT HER IN A HECTICK WITH REDNESS IN HER CHEEKS TOWARDS EVEN ING NIGHT SWEATS CONTINUAL LOOSENESS EXTREME WASTING OF HER FLESH AND AT LENGTH A SWELLING IN HER LEGS THOUGH SHE KEPT HER BED I DOUBT NOT BUT YOU REMEMBER THAT WE FELT SOME LITTLE KNOTS BETWIXT THE SEVENTH AND EIGHTH RIB WHICH WITH OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES MADE US CONCLUDE THE ADHESION WAS IN THAT PART AND WOULD HAVE LAID THE CAUSTICK THERE BUT THAT IT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE SPREAD TO THE GLANDS OF HER LEFT BREAST WHICH MADE US LAY IT BETWEEN THE SIXTH AND SEVENTH RIB SURSUM  AS SOON AS YOU COULD YOU TOOK IT OFF AND WITH YOUR KNIFE GENTLY PASSD THROUGH INTO THE CAVITY OF HER BREASTWHENCE ISSUED A BLOODYISH WATERBUT NO PUS BY BENDING YOUR PROBE YOU FOUND THE ADHESION REACH TO THE LOWER EDGE OF THE 7TH RIB AND BEFORE THE ESCHAR WAS SEPARATED THE PUS BEGAN TO FLOW AT EVERY DRES SING AND SO CONTINUED GRADUALLY ABATING TILL THE ULCER WAS CURED DURING WHICH A PART OF THE INSIDE OF THAT RIB ABOVE AN INCH LONG EXFOLIATED AND AFTER THAT ANOTHER  PIECE OF THE OUTSIDE OF THE RIB TOWARDS THE LATTER END OF THE CURE SHE COMPLAINED VERY MUCH OF A PAIN AT THE CAR TILAGO ENSIFORMIS SO GREAT THAT SHE SOMETIMES PLUCKD OUT THE HOLLOW TENT WHICH WE CONCEIVD WAS OCCASIONED BY ITS PRESSING UPON THE NERVE DURING THE FIRST 7 OR 8 DAYS OF HER RASH SHE RAISD VERY LITTLE IF ANY OF THAT PUS NOR DID IT DISCHARGE ITS SELF THEN BY THE ORISICE NOR WAS THERE A COL LECTION OF IT IN HER BREAST WHICH MADE ME APPREHEND THAT THE FEVER DID SO ALTER THE STATE OF HER BLOOD AS NOT TO PER D D D D D D D D MIT1382 MIT IT TO SEPARATE ITS IMPURITIES INTO THE ABSCESS I MUST OBSERVE TO YOUTHAT FOR SIX DAYS BEFORE THE FEVER BEGAN SHE HAD THE CARTEMENIA VERY ORDERLY BY AUGUST SHE WAS CURED HER SIDE HEALD UP AND WOULD NOT ENDURE IT TO BE CONVERTED INTO AN ISSUE BY OCTOBER SHE RECOVERED HER FLESH AND THE CATAMENIA RETURND WHICH HAD BEEN WANTING EVER SINCE MAY AND NOW AS YOU LATELY SAW HER SHE IS PLUMP FLESHY CLEAR AND FRESH COMPLEXIONED HAS LITTLE OR NO COUGH AND NO FAETID OR TABID EXPECTORATION AND SEEMS AND I BELIEVE IS PERFECTLY CURED HAVING FOR MANY MONTHS TAKEN NO MEDI CINE THERE ARE SEVERAL CIRCUMSTANCES IN THIS CASE WHICH I CAN NOT FORBEAR MAKING SOME REMARKS ON THAT THERE WAS AN ULCER IN THE LUNGS AND THAT IT HAS ADMITTED OF A CURE CONTRARY TO THE GENERAL OPINION OF PHY FICIANS THAT THIS ULCER DID CONTAIN AT LEAST 2 SPOONFULS AND MUST HAVE BEEN AS LARGE AS A HENS EGG THAT THIS ABSCESS AROSE FROM A COLLECTIONWITH AN INDISCENABLE IF ANY FEVER AND SO CONTINUED FROM CHRISTMAS TO ABOUT THE 10TH OF MAY THE TENDER MEMBRANOUS OR VESICULARY COMPOSITION OF THE LUNGS SEEM TO JUSTIFIE THIS OPINIONTHAT IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO HEAL WHEN THERE IS A CONSIDERABLE DIMINUTION OF THEM THE CONTINUAL AND INDISPENSABLE NECESSITY OF THEIR MO TION VERY MUCH HINDRING THE COALITION OF THE VESICULAE SEVERAL PARTS OF THE BODY AFFORD A PROPER CEMENT TO UNITE AND REPAIR THEM WHEN HURT OR DIMINISHD CARIOUS AND BROKEN BONES SEND FORTH A CALLUS WHEN THE SKIN IS CON SUMD BY ULCERS OR BURNS THE PARTS AFFORD A CICATRIX WHICH PRETTY WELL SUPPLIES THE DEFECT OF THE SKIN THE LUNGS SEPARATE A VISCID PITUITA WHICH WILL BE EXPANDED INTO FLEAKS LIKE A MEMBRANE MR STRINGER SARAH DEEPING AND SOME OTHER PATIENTS HAVE BROUGHT UP GREAT QUANTITIES OF THEM AND A LITTLE BOY AT MR TOLLEYS IN KENSINGTON COUGHD UP SEVERAL PIPES FORMD EXACTLY LIKE THE BRONCHIA AND ITS DIVARICATIONS AND AT FIRST VIEW SEEMD TO BE THE INTERNAL MEMBRANE MR BUSIERE MENTIONS THIS INSTANCE IN THE PHILO SOPHI1383 SOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS APRIL 1700 HIS HASTE WOULD NOT PER MIT HIM TO OBSERVE THE CASE SO EXACTLY AS IT DESERVD THIS CHILD TWO YEARS BEFORE HAD AN ULCER IN THE RIGHT SIDE OF HIS LUNGS AND THEY ADHERED TO HIS BACK WHEN I SEPARATED THEM I FOUND A CICATRIX NEAR THREE INCHES LONG BUT VERY LITTLE IF ANYDEFECT IN HIS LUNGSI AM OF OPINION THIS PITUITA OR MUCUS DOTH SERVE TO REUNITE THE PARTS OF THE LUNGS WHEN THERE IS A SOLUTION BY AN ULCER CONSUMPTIVE PERSONS GENERALLY FLATTER THEMSELVES THAT THEY HAVE NO ULCER IN THEIR LUNGS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT FEEL A FORENESS AS IN THE ULCERS OF OTHER PARTS THIS OPINION KEEPS THEM FROM MAKING A TIMELY APPLICATION TO PHYSICIANS WHILST THEY MIGHT RECEIVE A SPEEDY AND EASIE CURE WHEN YOU TOUCHD THE SOUND OR ULCERATED PARTS OF HER LUNGS WITH YOUR PROBE OR FINGER SHE DISCOVERED NO SENSE OF FEELING YOU WHICH MAY CONFIRM THE OPINION OF PHYSICIANS AND ANATOMISTS THAT THE LUNGS HAVE LITTLE IF ANY SENSATION WHEN YOU TOUCHD HER HEART WITH YOUR FINGER THO I BE LIEVE FOR NOT THE TWENTIETH PART OF A MINUTE SHE GREW VERY MUCH DISORDERED PALE AND READY TO FAINT WHICH SHOWS NATURE CANNOT SUFFER THE LEAST ALTERATION IN ITS PULSATION WITH OUT GREAT PREJUDICE AND INCONVENIENCY IT IS THE OPINION OF SOME PHYSICIANSTHAT THE FEVER WHICH ATTENDS CONSUMPTIVE PATIENTS ARISES FROM SOME PARTICLES OF THE PUS WHICH BEING RECEIVD INTO THE BLOOD AND CIRCULA TING WITH IT CAUSE THAT EFFERVESCENCE WHICH WE CALL AN HECTICK THIS PATIENT HAD NO FEVER FROM CHRISTMAS TO MAY AND THEN UNHAPPILY CAME A CONTINUED FEVER WITH A RASH WHICH LEFT A FEBRICITATION EVERY AFTERNOON WITH THOSE SYMPTOMS WHICH ATTEND A HECTICK I HAVE OBSERVED FOR MANY YEARS THAT IF I COULD PRESERVE MY CONSUMPTIVE PATIENTS FROM THAT HECTICK FEVER OR RE LIEVED THEM WHO ALREADY LABOURD UNDER IT I COULD CURE THEM THO THEIR EXPECTORATION WAS VERY PLENTIFUL AND FOUL I DOUBT NOT BUT IF SOME OF OUR FACULTY APPLIED THEMSELVES MORE PARTICULARLY TO THE CURE OF CONSUMPTIONS SO MANY D D D D D D D D 2 THOU1384 THOUSANDS WOULD NOT DYE OF IT YEARLY IN THIS CITY AS AP PEARS BY THE BILLS OF MORTALITY I DO NOT DOUBT BUT SOME PART OF HER LUNGS DO ADHERE TO HER SIDE AND ITS PROBABLE A LITTLE PART OF THEM DO NOT RE CEIVE THE AIR IN INSPIRATION BUT I BELIEVE THAT DEFECT IS VERY INCONSIDERABLE BECAUSE SHE CAN RUN UP STAIRS AND IS NO MORE DISORDERED IN HER BREATH THAN MOST OTHER PEOPLE THE  DISCHARGE OF THE PUS BY HER LYING DOWN IN THAT POSTURE DID UNDOUBTEDLY VERY MUCH PRESERVE HER LUNGS AND PREVENTED ITS BREAKING THROUGH THE ABSCESS INTO THE CAVITY OF HER BREAST AND PUTRIFYING HER LUNGS TO A GREATER DEGREE PUS GENERAT PUS IS A NOTED APHORISM AND THE AIR BLADDERS OF THE LUNGS ARE SO VERY TENDER THAT THEY MUST HAVE YIELDED TO THE PRESSURE OF THE PUS HAD IT LAIN LONG IN THE ABSCESS AND BEEN ONLY DISCHARGD BY VIOLENT COUGHING BY LYING IN A PROPER POSTURE SIR THO PROBY SARAH DEEPING AND OTHER PERSONS HAVE PREVENTED A GREATER SOLUTION IN THEIR LUNGS AND EITHER PROLONGD THEIR LIVES MANY YEARS OR RE COVERED THEIR HEALTHS BY PROPER MEDICINES THIS AND OTHER INSTANCES MAKE ME EASILY CONCUR WITH SOME PHYSICIANS IN AN OPINION THAT IN SOME FAMILIES THE LUNGS HAVE ORIGINALLY A MORE TENDER CONSTITUTION THAN IN OTHERS MRS TERRYS AUNTS ARE SUBJECT TO GREAT COUGHS AND PTYSICK HER AUNT FOWKES LITTLE DAUGHTER OF ABOUT 7 YEARS OLD HAVING A LITTLE FEVER WITH SOME SYMPTOMS OF THE SMALL POX BUT A GREAT DIFFICULTY IN BREATHING I ADVISED HER BLEED ING AT THE ARM BUT SHE WAS SO FAT YOU COULD NOT FIND A VEIN THAT NIGHT NEXT DAY THE SMALL POX APPEARD WHICH A LITTLE CASD HER LUNGS UPON THE SIXTH NIGHT AFTER SHE RAISD AT SEVERAL TIMES ABOUT 7 OR 8 OUNCES OF CLEAR BLOODBY VIOLENT COUGHING I WAS SENT FOR AND DREW AWAY ABOUT 6 OUNCES OF BLOOD BY LEECHES WHICH TOTALLY RELIEVD HER BREATH AND STOPPD THE RAISING BLOOD THIS INSTANCE I MENTION BEING SO LIKE MRS TERRYS TO CONFIRM WHAT I SAID BEFORE AND TO E VINCE THAT SO GREAT LOSS OF BLOOD WILL NOT HINDER THE RE GULAR PROCEEDING OF THE SMALLPOX WHICH SHE WENT THROUGH VERY1385 VERY ORDERLY AND RECOVERED PERFECTLY I HAVE OBSERVD THE SAME EFFECT IN OTHER PATIENTS IN WHOM BLEEDING AFTER ERUP TION WAS INDISPENSABLE THE CONTINUAL MOTION OF THE BREAST IN BREATHING MADE THE CAUSTICK SPREAD FARTHER THAN IT WAS DESIGND OR COULD BE PREVENTED I HAVE PREVAILD WITH SOME PATIENTS TO YIELD TO AN APERTION BY LAUNCET WHICH I TAKE IN SOME CASES TO BE THE BETTER WAY THAT LITTLE BLOOD WHICH MAY POSSIBLY GET INTO THE CAVITY OF THE BREAST IS EASILY THROWN OUT AGAIN BY THE LUNGS IN INSPIRATION AS YOU MAY REMEMBER SHE DID THE INJECTION EVERY TIME YOU USED IT YOU CANNOT FORGET HOW AFTER THE PUS BEGAN TO FLOW AT THE ORIFICE IT LESSEND THE RAISING IT AT HER MOUTH AND IN NO LONG TIME THE PURULENT EXPECTORATION TOTALLY CEASD S I R THIS LETTER ALREADY EXCEEDS ITS PROPER BOUNDS THERE FORE I WILL OMIT SOME OTHER REMARKS OF LESS CONSEQUENCE VIZ ON THE BLOODY COLOURD PITUITA THE FETID ODOR OF THE PUS AND THE RASH FEVER WHICH CAME WITHOUT ANY MANI FEST CAUSE AND ONLY SUBSCRIBE MY SELF YOUR MOST AFFECTIONATE FRIEND AND SERVANT

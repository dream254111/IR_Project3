the remodeling of municipal government gives to all cities in large part the high degree of centrali zation of administration that was enjoyed under the old federal plan It will be remembered that between 1892 and 1902 three Ohio cities Cleveland Toledo and Columbusoperated on a plan of government that justly attracted widespread attention and won national praise Fixing final responsibility upon the mayor it divided the administrative affairs of the city into several departments with a director appointed and removable by the mayor at the head of each These officials in turn with the mayor then organized into a board of control which re viewed at semiweekly meetings the work of the several departments592 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW adjusted differences or disagreements and week after week aimed to round out and consummate the pledged programme The city council was very properly relieved of a voice in pure admin istrative detail The central government untrammeled by outside control was enabled to keep pace with the manifold demands upon the exercise and extension of its functions The scheme was appropriately called the federal plan because it imitated the national cabinet the mayor corresponding to the president and the several departmental directors to the respective secretarial heads Eminently successful was the plan giving to the city rapid responsible and inexpensive public service Above all it made possible the tracing of misgovernment to one sourcethe office of the chief executive This ability to attach responsibility and make that responsibility count came out forcibly on the occasion of the defeat of Mayor McKisson whom the people checked in a promising political career because they were convinced he was seeking to convert this centralized mechanism into a personal political machine The plan certainly was not abandoned on account of total or partial failure It was sacrificed in the epochmaking and sweeping decision of the Ohio supreme court which ruled that all special legislation was unconstitutional and therefore null and void1 An elaborate municipal code followed as its successor It is use less at this late date to undertake a discussion of the provisions of this instrument They have been repeatedly described and discussed elsewhere In a nutshell its hundred or more octave pages containing 231 sections succeeded admirably in decentralizing the prevailing uni fied machinery bequeathed it In matters of administrative interest the council was elevated to a position of inordinate importance The mayor was converted into a figurehead with numerous paper powers An excellent opportunity was everywhere opened for loggerhead situations in the management of the citys business Fortunately on account of the domination of at least three Ohio mayors many of the abuses which threatened to spring up were crushed in their infancy Particularly in Cleveland under the able leadership of Tom L Johnson and to a large degree in Toledo in the respective terms of Sam Jones and Brand Whitlock the high degree of efficiency created under the federal plan was maintained almost unimpaired The results in Columbus are not definitely known Cincinnati did not I The  federal plan had come as a special concession on the part of the legisla itire to the three cities mentionedNEWS AND NOTES 593 use the federal plan and therefore no comparison with the code is possible However everyone in Ohio concedes that before 1902 the government of the Queen City was in the hands of the state legislature and George B Cox while since then it has been in the sole control of the latter Hence in the chief cities of Ohio but one by a happy turn of political fortunes many possible abuses which the code con ceived were never vitalized However the good citizens of the state have never been wholly at ease until now The substitution of the Paine law not only cuts short the code experiment but it also stills much growing anxiety What does the Paine law do The code had replaced the depart mental heads of the federal plan by a board of public service a board of public safety and a city solicitor auditor and treasurerall elective officers except the board of public safety The members of the board of public service were left to divide their powers and duties as they pleased If an opportune division were struck the citys business stood a fair chance of being transacted with reasonable efficiency If not with responsibility Shifting from shoulder to shoulder a break down was sure to occur at many points In the case of the board of public safety while the members received their appointment at the hands of the mayor2 and presumably should look to him for direction so ingeniously did the code twist the reciprocal powers of the mayor and the safers by numerous provisions and counterprovisions that in the end the board was left practically free to do as it pleased if it chose to and yet be at liberty to thrust all blame for incompetency or negligence either upon the subordinate chiefs appointed and removable by the mayor or upon the mayor himself These are two illustrations of what could easily have occurred and what perhaps has happened unblushingly in Cincinnati had not the intervention of the three chief executives we have mentioned brought with it an assurance of fixed responsibility and a conscientious desire to maintain the spirit of Ohios municipal institutions even though the law had been abrogated Let us now proceed directly to the fundamental provisionsof the Paine law First of all a department of public service and one of public safety are created with a single individual as director at the head of each Both are appointed and can be removed by the mayor The three together form a board of control with powers resembling those of the old board under the federal plan Within the compass 2 With the confirmation of the council594 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW of the first department are included what may conveniently be called the divisions of public works and parks3 Under the control of the second department are brought not only the police and fire divisions but also the departments of charities and correction and buildings4 Under the old code the latter two branches constituted departments of public service The Paine arrangement is not only more logical but lends itself to a greater degree of working harmony and unified policy for the departments concerned Each director is given full control in the management and super vision of his department and in the making of rules and regulations A limited power of appointment is given in the classified service His contract prerogative is subject to the 500 rule beyond which specific appropriation by the council is required At the same time no con tract above this amount can be awarded at any time without the approval of the board of control thus ultimately vesting the mayor and direc tors with discretionary power and responsibility in the making of large expenditures Each director determines and coordinates the various subdivisions of his department 3 Under the code the board of public service in Cleveland was separated into three divisions public works parks and charities and correction The full powers of the department under the new plan sections 140 and 141 are as follows SEC 140 The director of public service shall supervise the improvement and repair of streets avenues alleys lands lanes squares wharves docks landings market houses bridges viaducts aqueducts sidewalks playgrounds sewers drains ditches culverts ship channels streams and water courses the lighting sprinkling and cleaning of all public places the construction of public improve ments and public works except as provided in section 147 hereof or as otherwise provided in this act SEC 141 The directors of public service shall have the management of all municipal water lighting and heating plants parks baths market house ceme teries crematories sewage disposal plants and farms as well as all public buildings and other property of the corporation     Said directors of public service shall also manage and control all houses of refuge and correction workhouses city farm schools infirmaries hospitals pest houses and all other charitable and reformatory institutions 4 SEC 147 The director of public safety shall be the chief administrative author ity of the fire police charity correction and building departments and shall have all powers and duties connected with and incident to the appointment regulation and government of these departments except as otherwise provided by law  He shall manage and make all contracts in reference to the police stations fire houses cemeteries and reform schools houses of correction infirmaries hospitals workhouses farms pest houses and all other charitable and reformatory institu tions now or hereafter established and maintainedNEWS AND NOTES 595 In addition to his former quasilegislative power5 there is conferred upon the mayor an extensive appointive power Besides the directors all heads of subdepartments and many members of the unclassified service are to receive their commissions from him His power is rarely contingent upon the consent of the council Instead he appoints and removes with a free hand With such latitude there can be little doubt that the office of chief executive will again return to the exalted place it occupied in the last decade A thoroughgoing system of civil service is next introduced City officials and employees are separated into two categories the classified and the unclassified service In general the latter branch includes holders of elective positions departmental and division heads experts desultory employees and unskilled laborers6 The classified service shall comprise offices and places not included in the unclassified service by which is meant the great army of employees of the departments of service and safety A civil service commission consisting of three members who hold office for three years and retire in annual rotation is periodically to be chosen by a committee made up of the president of the board of education the president of the board of sinking fund commissioners and the president of the city council The commissioners are endowed with the usual power of making rules and regulations for examinations and the grading of offices and positions similar in char acter in groups and divisions so as to permit the filling of offices and positions in the higher grades as far as practicable through promotions7 The method of appointment to places in the classified service is simple The appointing board or officer shall notify the commission of any vacancy to be filled The commission shall thereupon certify to such board or officer the three candidates graded highest in the respective lists as shown by the result of such examination Such board or officer shall thereupon appoint one of the three so certified8 Grades and standings of applicants must be kept on record for at least six months but the commission mav drop an applicant any time after he has been thrice certified In the case of all appointments and employments the appointing officer must report back to the commission Under the code 6 See section 158 See section 159 8 See section 160 The plan of permitting the appointing official to select one from a certain number of the highest candidatesthree five or sevencombines the requirements of fair play with the advantage on the citys part of choosing the596 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW the name of the appointee or employee the title character of office date of commencement of service salary or compensation and such other information as the commission may require in keeping its roster The latter record must be open to public inspection  at all reasonable hours While superior officials may suspend subordinates for a period of not more than thirty days pending a complete investigation no member of the classified service can be permanently discharged except on the grounds of immorality or incompetency A reasonable oppor tunity to know the charges must be given the accused and he must be heard in his own behalf Whether the commissioners shall receive compensation or not has wisely been left with the respective city councils to decide9 They are however required to be resident electors It is of course of supreme importance that none but men of the highest integrity and regard for the public welfare shall be attracted to this office All things considered it seems that the council should either provide for a large salary or none whatever The appointment of business or professional men of high standing who will bring to the office the single ambition of plac ing the civil service upon a strictly business basis will thus be insured Experience teaches that a low salary gets a cheap man while well compensated or else gratuitous offices secure the highest type of men In the present instance a medium salary say 2000 or 2500 which would secure students or experts from the country at large is precluded by that despairing sine qua non of home rule which insists that all officeholders high and low shall be neighborsof the electorate Some day American legislatures and councils will outgrow this provincial prejudice and following the European idea obtain specialists wherever available That will only be when the popular notion of politics shall have freed itself from the hypnotic illusions of sentiment and the communistic brotherly love theory is consigned to oblivion These are the main provisions of the new law a careful examination of which induces the writer to accept it as a sincere attempt on the part of an heretofore intractable legislature to give the citiesof Ohio a fuller opportunity for good government The offices of city auditor best allaround man whether he be the highest on the list or not In practice this scheme has been found to combine the maximum of justice and efficiency and to obviate disadvantages from which even the civil service system is not free 9 SEC 164     The council shall provide for the salaries if any of the commission for such clerical force examiners necessary expenses and accomoda tions as may be necessary for the work of the commissionNEWS AND NOTES 597 treasurer and solicitor are not affected by the change remaining still elective It is therefore a misnomer to call the Paine act a return to the old federal plan The new law assures much centralization of administrative powers but it does not restore the old departmental form of government While people in Ohio will doubtless agree that it is desirable to keep the offices of treasurer and auditor particularly the latter10 independent of outside control by making them directly responsible to the voters the act ought to have changed the solicitorship from an elective to an appointive basis The increased latitude of the citys legal responsi bilities and the consequent dependence of all departments upon the law department for guidance demand that its head be in political agree ment with the administration Despite a diminution in the partisan spirit in municipal politics the practices of partisanship still persist and will continue for a long time to come Consequently a difference in partisan affiliations between the mayor and the solicitor may easily upset the programme of the former and prevent the realization of the platform upon which he was elected To grasp this readily one needs only to speculate on the outcome of the street railway struggle in Cleve land if at any stage in its career a Republican solicitor had been elected on the same ticket with Mayor Johnson Waiving the question whether or no this would have been a consummation devoutly to be wished there can be no doubt that the public will would have been thwarted in its main purpose So closely dependent was the fight for lower fares upon legal sanctions that an unsympathetic head of the law department might have brought tha contest to a premature end through simple inertia

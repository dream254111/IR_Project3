and that I am not quite sure that I shall be able to make myself entirely clear in the limited time at my disposal I do think however that the points which I shall men 1 Read at the meeting of the Bay Section of the Western Society of Naturalists Stanford Univer sity November 29 1918 tion should be more often opened to serious consideration Inasmuch as there are probably about as many different notions of  naturalist as there are users of the word it may be necessary to say that by this term I now mean any one who is actively interested in living things as such In primitive societies most of the leaders are naturalists In fact in most cases their leadership depends on attainments of that sort The medicine man gains and holds his posi tion very largely through his shifty use of knowledge of certain characteristics of ani mals in general and of his fellows in par ticular The chieftain also usually bases his influence on successes derived from familiarity with activities of all sorts of animals Cer tain women may gain indulgence or even gen eral respect through exceptional familiarity with medicinal and food values of great numbers of plants and animals It is of course easy to see that primitive leadership is thus conditioned because primitive man is individually in contact with the natural en vironment and appreciative of its mysteries also because in an unspecialized social group all the members are sufficiently acquainted with every phase of activity to be able to understand and fairly to evaluate unusual skill and intelligence As society advances in complexity from the primitive stage and as more and more special ization occurs there are larger and larger numbers of individuals removed from natural to artificial conditions of existence Not only so but many of them are so far removed that they cease to have any knowledge of natural existence and so become entirely out of sym pathy with those who retain some contact with and some interest in the natural order of things This remoteness from nature may be physical as in the city dweller or mental as in the rural resident who sees nothing but a pecuniary return through manipulation of same natural object Thus it happens that the abilities of the naturalist tend to be ob scured ignored or derided in a complex so ciety His standing amongst his fellows is reduced to the lowest rank and his influence 448 SCIENCENOVEMBER 14 1919 nears the vanishing point It requires pecu liar devotion to a cause to face such obscurity and indifference hence those who chose to be naturalists under such conditions are often seclusive reticent and even indifferent to in terests of others In recent years there has been a good deal of discussion of the need of considering the wholeness of organisms of organiza4ons of various social groups etc Every one seems ready to concede that we do not know a thing until we know all its relationships and that we do not know an organism or an organization until we know all its component parts Every one seems willing to concede in the abstract that an organism is not complete if even the smallest part be missing or the obscurest function impaired Practically when it comes to cases this view is not fully sustained as is well illustrated in case of the naturalist whose talents are insufficiently used and whose valuable point of view is largely ignored The community as a whole suffers material loss from his submersion At this point it may be well to raise the question as to the proper status of the nat uralist in our own social order Should he be expected to take the highest place in leader ship Or a secondary place Or should he be denied any leadership at all Intelligent answer to such questions requires some exami nation of the naturalists worth to his com munity or to society at large Typically a statement of this worth may be brought under the following heads 1 He may make dis coveries which will extend the sources for food clothing transportation and manufac ture 2 He may make discoveries which enable better preservation and greater con servation of resources in health and wealth 3 He may make discoveries which will en able better understanding of the fundamental laws governing the activities of all living things 4 With his broad outlook he may so organize all available knowledge as to ob tain better development of natural resources and better distribution and use of natural products 5 He may so systematize useful information as to make essential features readily available for specialists with limited time and restricted outlook 6 He may so condense simplify and popularize available information as to make it not only usable but to some extent tasteful to those unskilled in scientific thought Thus the sympathy of his fellows may be extended and their positive support secured 7 He may be on the look out for young people with ability who need encouragement to proceed along lines of study in natural history and he may so encourage them 8 Last but not least he may him self give time consistently and regularly to consideration of the problems of his com munity and of society at large and he may then exert his voice and influence for the things which from his broad viewpoint ap pear right Thus he may to some extent act as a balancing power even though he may not have or care to exercise powers of aggressive leadership From the foregoing it must appear that the naturalist should be accorded and that he should be willing to assume a place of very considerable importance in our social order The character of this place will vary materially with conditions In a small community exist ing under very simple conditions a naturalist of even modern abilities might be expected in most cases to be dominant in leadership In a larger more complex community only one of exceptional ability might reach great prominence In such a community the nat uralist of moderate ability would probably be limited to exerting influence in various ways His efforts might bring larger results and his life accomplish more than in the smaller com munity though obscured by his relatively less importance Here and there are a few nat uralists of sufficient general ability to assume leadership in national affairs It is a matter of great importance that they should be en couraged to do so This paper must further concern itself mainly with the naturalist of moderate ability limited opportunities and restricted field that is to say the ordinary sort It seems to me that he ought to be encouraged to think of himself as having an obligation to the com munity an obligation beyond the direct re sults of his scientific work the obligation of SCIENCE 449N S VoL L No 1298 personal activity and interest in community affairs This interest might be manifested by public and private discussion of public prob lems and community affairs In such dis cussions the naturalist is peculiarly equipped for seeing the necessity of complete analysis of a question since he himself is repeatedly confronted with complex situations due to a multitude of factors all of which must be more or less accurately evaluated He is also able to see the need of giving time for a situation to develop itself since he is so familiar with the fact that Nature is un hurried in her operations whether their dur ation be seconds or ages He is able to see the need of caution and accuracy in procedure since he is so frequently confronted with errors due to the impossibility of eliminating chance combinations That is to say the naturalist is able to bring to the consideration of a problem those methods which tend to accuracy of judgment and clarity of vision Certainly any individual who can do this in a community should exert a valuable influence Since the members of a highly specialized community have a marked tendency to become narrow onesided and so to a considerable degree abnormal it is very necessary to have some influence in the other direction This too the naturalist may be able to supply to a great extent Popular talks on natural phe nomena in connection with schools churches or other organizations may be made of value Pictures may be largely used for this pur pose Ordinary conversations may often be turned to advantage along this line Simple exhibits of various sorts may be possible Any method which will induce even super ficial acquaintance of the general public with the great world of life is of distinct advantage from the standpoint of the human community however it may be from the scientific stand point lNote particularly in this connection that the beneficial effect is reciprocal i e the narrow are broadened the onesided more rounded and the abnormal made more nearly normal on the one hand while on the other hand the naturalist is stimulated pleased and supported in his work both financially and morally in a way not before possible Since there may be some who are still wondering what is the object of this paper I may call attention to the fact that we have today some very strong evidence pointing to the view that the day of individualism is rapidly passing and that the day of collec tivism of some sort comes on apace It is no more permissible for the man of science to shut himself up in his own interests and to assume an air of lofty indifference to the aims and aspirations of other people than it is for the business or professional man to do so It is time for the man of science to take some cognizance of public affairs and to assume an active part therein however small no matter how much he may be tempted to go into his laboratory or his woods and fields and to ignore the general interests of humanity It seems to me not at all beneath the dignity of such a body as this to consider ways and means of getting in closer touch with the people about us of arousing their interest in us and our interest in them and thus con tributing our share toward the harmonizing of society as a whole I feel certain that there are hundreds of people in this state who ought to have some interest in some or all of the things which we as individuals are doing I think our state would be a better state if there were some understanding of that sort It seems to me that we are too much disposed to let the especially able men like Dr Jordan Dr Ritter Dr Evermann and others do what they can and to feel that we ourselves are thereby relieved of obligation I do not think that is a correct attitude If we want to have the general public respond as it should to the call for progress in sci entific matters we must each be willing to sacrifice some prejudice some leisure and some effort for the good of the cause I think too that we should collectively look over the field and consider the possibility of instituting or extending some activity that will help What I have said simply indicates some of the lines along which I think activity might possibly be directed In conclusion let me say that I think the naturalist ought to fill in his community a place of influence or of leadership that be 450 SCIENCENOVEMBER 14 1919 cause of his qualifications he ought if nee essary to seek such a place and that an organization of naturalists ought to definitely consider ways and means of extending its influence as far as possible This is a day of propaganda The un worthy type will prevail if it is not overridden or displaced by the worthy type Any and every learned society is under constructive obligation to do what it can in such a cause but we must always remember the danger of attempting anything of the sort without first eliminating all traces of pedantry W E ALLEN SCRIPPS INSTITUTION LA JOLLA CALIF

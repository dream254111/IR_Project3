nary botanical works the little book  Ex amining and Grading Grains  Ginn by Professors Lyon and Montgomery will be found useful Many a botanist will be sur prised at the number of things which may be seen in a careful study of these common plants For classes in applied botany in agricultural schools and colleges it must prove very helpful FOSSIL IOWA PLANTS PROFESSOR MACBRIDES paper on Certain Fossil Plant Remains in the Iowa HerbarAUGUST 23 1907 SCIENCE 259 ium  is an interesting contribution which appeared recently in the Proceedings of the Davenport Academy of Sciences It is ac companied with a dozen excellent plates Several new species are described namely Sigillaria calvini Psaronius borealis and Araucarioxylon occidentale Two modern spe cies are recognized viz Picea mariana from beneath the drift in Washington county Iowa and P canadensis from the base of the blue clay in Keokuk county OUR FOREST RESERVES UNDER the title of  The Use of the Na tional Forests  the United States Forest Service has issued a booklet of fortytwo pages giving much information in regard to the National Forests forest reserves and in tended to explain concisely what they are for and how they should be used A few well selected halftone reproductions of suggestive photographs add materially to what must prove to be a very useful publication HISTORY OF AMERICAN BOTANY IN the June number of The Popular Science Monthly Professor Underwood publishes an entertaining account of the Progress of our Knowledge of the Flora of North America illustrated by half a dozen reproductions of plates from the old works of Porta Bock Cornut Plukenet and Micheli and a fac simile of a page of Linnes  Species Plan tarum The paper is well worth reading especially by the younger botanists who had no part in the work of the last half of the ineteenth century SOUTH DAKOTA CONIFERS A BULLETIN of more than local interest is No 102 of the South Dakota Experiment Station devoted to Evergreens for South Dakota It was prepared by Professor Hansen and brings together the results of many years of experience upon the prairies and plains of the northwest While the treat ment is necessarily quite popular the bulletin contains much information which must prove useful to the botanist who is interested in the relations of climate soil and other physical factors to the distribution of species No botanist can run over these pages without finding that some of his notions as to the dis tribution of the conifers must undergo ma terial change Twentysix halftone illustra tions help the reader to a better understand ing of the text SEEDS OF COMMON GRASSES MuoH like the foregoing is bulletin No 141 of the Kansas Experiment Station in which Professor Roberts and Mr Freeman discuss and illustrate the seeds of certain common grasses and the common adulterants and sub stitutes Here again the botanist who is in terested in a critical knowledge of plants may obtain many hints as to the usefulness botan ically of such work as this in our experiment stations when done as carefully as this seems to have been Few systematic botanists have that accurate and detailed knowledge of the seeds of grasses which was necessary in the preparation of this bulletin It may in deed be considered a valuable contribution to the morphology of systematic botany as well as a helpful bulletin for the practical farmer A TROPICAL SCHOOL OF BOTANY PROFESSOR DOCTOR KELLERMAN of the Ohio State University Columbus Ohio has planned a tropical school of botany for next winter which ought to attract the attention of some of our young men who are fitting themselves for their life work as teachers of botany The session extends from December 19 to March 19 and will be held in Guatemala Central America The camps will be located at Zacapa 100 miles from the coast Los Amates 40 miles inland Izabal on Lake Izabal and perhaps also at Livingston on the coast Only a small number of young men will be accepted and those who intend joining are advised to do so at the earliest day possible The fee for the three months including traveling expenses board and lodging is 22600 The project is one that should be of interest to botanists generally as affording excellent opportunities for in struction along unusual botanical lines260 SCIENCE N S VOL XXVI No 660 DR MAXWELL T MASTERS THE July number of the Journal of Botany London contains a portrait and short ac count of the life of the late Dr Maxwell T Masters the wellknown English botanist who died on the thirtieth of May last at the age of seventyfour years He wrote Vegetable Teratology a book that for nearly forty years has been the standard and practically the only work on the subject He was also the editor of the Gardeners Chronicle perhaps the fore most horticultural journal in the world PROGRESSUS REI BOTANICAE ANOTHER Heft 3 of Dr Lotsys Prog ressus Rei Botanicae  pub by Fischer Jena has made its appearance It carries the first volume from page 533 to its conclusion p 642 and contains but one article by R P van Calcar Die Fortschritte der Im munitaits und Spezifizititslehre seit 18T0 NEW EDITION OF CAMPBELLS BOTANY AFTER five years the Macmillans bring out a second edition of Campbells wellknown University Textbook of Botany So well written was the first edition that it was not necessary to make many changes in the text in fact the new book is so little different from the old that it may be used in the same class with no inconvenience It is practically the best general textbook today for the American student of advanced botany EXPERIMENTS ON THE INFLUENCE OF LIdHT IN the October Annals of Botarny Professor Peirce records certain experiments made by him to determine the kind and amount of irritability of certain young plants in rela tion to light Although his experiments were interrupted before completion by the San Francisco earthquake he shows that as the direction of illumination is usual or unusual certain plants have their normal form or some other wholly different It is evident he says that unless the young plants develop ing from the spore are exposed to influences like those under which their parents developed they will be unlike their parents A broader statement of this conclusion is that  certain physical factors of the environment constant or periodic but unchanging constitute means of repeating parental characters generation after generation and these environmental in fluences are as essential as the substance Given the same chemical compounds and the same arrangement of these in the fertilized egg as in the parents the young must be like the parents if their environment is the same The paper is well worth careful reading and it is to be hoped that Professor Peirce will be able soon to resume his abruptly inter rupted experiments CHARLES E BESSEY THE UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA

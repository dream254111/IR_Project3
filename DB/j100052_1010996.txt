NORTH AND SOUTH CAROLINA AND FLORIDA COVERING PARTICU LARLY THE EMPLOYMENT OF CHILDREN IN THE COTTON INDUSTRY AND THE MANUFACTURE OF TOBACCO IN THE SOFT COAL REGIONS OF PENNSYLVANIA WEST VIRGINIA AND

SECRETARIES OR APPEAR IN THE VARIOUS PAMPHLETS AND LEAFLETS PUBLISHED BY THE COMMITTEE WHILE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE RESULTS OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS IS IMPOS SIBLE HERE THE FOLLOWING GENERAL CONCLUSIONS ARE SUBMITTED A IN THE SOUTHERN STATES THE EXCESSIVE LENGTH OF THE WORKDAY IS UNIVERSALLY A HARDSHIP UPON THE CHILDREN IN MANUFACTURE WHILE THE AGE LIMITS PRESCRIBED BY LAW LOW AS THEY ARE ARE SUBJECT TO ALMOST UNIVERSAL VIOLATION OWING TO THE LACK OF OFFICIAL FACTORY INSPECTION AND OF AUTHENTIC EVIDENCE OF THE AGE OF EMPLOYED CHILDREN B A REPLY TO THE ARGUMENT THAT THE GLASS FACTORY DEPENDS FOR LIFE UPON THE NIGHT WORK OF LITTLE CHILDREN IS IN THE FACT THAT THE GLASS X50SECRETARYS ANNUAL REPORT INDUSTRY SHOWS A GREATER INCREASE IN THE STATES OHIO ILLINOIS NEW YORK CAREFULLY FORBIDDING THE EMPLOYMENT OF YOUNG CHIL DREN AT NIGHT THAN IN THE THREE LEADING GLASS MANUFACTURING STATES INDIANA NEW JERSEY PENNSYLVANIA PERMITTING CHILD LABOR AT NIGHT THE AGE LIMIT FOR EMPLOYMENT IN GLASS FACTORIES IN MISSOURI MARYLAND AND WEST VIRGINIA IS SO LOW AND EM PLOYMENT OF YOUNG CHILDREN AT NIGHT SO EXTENSIVE AS TO OFFER A SERIOUS MENACE TO EDUCATION AND HEALTH C THE EMPLOYMENT OF CHILDREN IN THE SOFT COAL MINES VARIES ACCORD ING TO LAWS AND INDUSTRIAL CONDITIONS THE WORST CONDITIONS THUS FAR DISCOVERED ARE IN CERTAIN SECTIONS OF PENNSYLVANIA ALTHOUGH THE EMPLOYMENT OF LITTLE BOYS UNDERGROUND IS EXTENSIVE IN MARY LAND AND WEST VIRGINIA D THE CONDITIONS OF CHILD EMPLOYMENT IN THE MINES AND BREAKERS OF THE ANTHRACITE COAL REGION ARE SLIGHTLY IMPROVED PARTLY DUE TO THE AWAKENING OF PUBLIC INTEREST PARTLY TO THE INSTALLATION OF MECHANICAL DEVICES THE DECREASE IN CHILD LABOR THUS FAR IS SLIGHT HOWEVER AND THE EXTENT OF THE EMPLOYMENT OF BOYS RANG ING FRPM NINE TO FOURTEEN YEARS OF AGE IS VIRTUALLY AS REPORTED TO THIS COMMITTEE A YEAR AGO THE VIGOR OF THE MINE INSPEC TION DEPARTMENT IN ATTEMPTING TO ENFORCE THE PRESENT INADEQUATE LAW IS GRATIFYING IN A RECENT ORDER ISSUED BY THE CHIEF INSPECTOR OF MINES HE CALLS THE ATTENTION OF HIS DEPUTIES TO THE FACT THAT DECEPTION AS TO THE AGES OF WORKING CHILDREN IS FREQUENT AND ORDERS THE AGGRESSIVE PROSECUTION OF PARENTS OR EMPLOYERS WHO EVADE OR DISOBEY THE LAW AS REPEATEDLY SHOWN IN REPORTS OF OUR INVESTIGATIONS THE MINE INSPECTORS ARE PRACTICALLY POWERLESS TO CORRECT THIS GREAT ABUSE OF CHILD LABOR UNTIL

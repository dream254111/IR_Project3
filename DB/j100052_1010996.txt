j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1010996,Secretarys Annual Report for the Third Fiscal Year September 30 1907,i242592,Secretarys Annual Report TEXAS Interest is developing in Texas concerning the needed amendments to the Texas child labor law which has not been touched for several years It is 1oped that a state committee can be organized in Texas in the near future and that a successful effort will be made before the Texas Legisla ture of I909 to raise the standard of child labor legislation in that state A J MCKELWAY Secretary for the Southern States National Child Labor Committee SECRETARYS ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE THIRD FISCAL YEAR SEPTEMBER 30 I907 I LEGISLATIONSTATE During the third fiscal year legislatures in eighteen States enacted child labor laws of importance Florida placing a law on the statute books for the first time Alabama Maine Missouri Nebraska New York Vermont Minnesota Idaho Tennessee and South Carolina enacted important amend ments The net results of the year justify the belief that more complete organization in the various states would place this Committee in a position to powerfully influence needed legislation in all parts of the country In New Jersey a bill to prohibit the employment at night of boys under sixteen was defeated by the combined influence of the glass manufacturers and their employees In Pennsylvania a bill was presented by the Pennsyl vania Committee to correct flagrant defects in the present Pennsylvania law This was defeated through the influence of manufacturing interests the adverse activities of the factory inspection department and the inability of the Pennsylvania Committee or of this Committee to pursue the campaign with the persistency required by the situation Had the National Child Labor Committee been able to maintain skilled workers at the Harrisburg Legislature during the last two months of the legislative session it is prob able that not less than Ioooo children would be in school who are today in the mines and factories of that State FEDERAL Five important child labor bills before Congress received the attention of the National Child Labor Committee especially through the personal efforts of the Secretary Dr Lindsay and of Assistant Secretary Dr McKel way at Washington I A bill to incorporate By Act of Congress the National Child Labor Committee received articles of incorporation dated March 8 I907 2 The District of Columbia Child Labor Bill held over from the pre ceding session was favorably considered in both Houses but failed of passage aPassed May 28 1908 149The Annals of the American Academy 3 A bill for the establishment of a National Childrens Bureau This measure which has received the endorsement of a large number of organizations interested in the protection of children failed to pass either House 4 A bill authorizing an investigation under the Department of Com merce and Labor of the conditions of working women and children in America Congress appropriated I50ooo to this purpose and placed the direction of the work in the hands of the United States Commissioner of Labor 5 The BeveridgeParsons Child Labor Bill to exclude from interstate commerce articles presented for shipment by factories or mines employing children under fourteen years of age This bill originally an independent measure but later added as an amend ment to the District of Columbia Child Labor Bill did not come to vote in either House Thus two of the five child labor bills were enacted The first places the National Child Labor Committee officially before the American public as an incorporated organization while the second should lay a scientific foundation for such federal and state legislation as may be desirable by providing accurate and authoritative information on the extent and conditions of child employment II INVESTIGATION Extensive investigations have been conducted during the year in Ala bama Louisiana North and South Carolina and Florida covering particu larly the employment of children in the cotton industry and the manufacture of tobacco in the soft coal regions of Pennsylvania West Virginia and Maryland in the glass industry in Ohio Indiana Illinois West Virginia Missouri and Maryland and in the anthracite coal communities of Pennsyl vania To secure material for use at the Jamestown Exposition during the summer an investigation was made of street trades in New York City Philadelphia and Scranton the physical effects of premature employment as seen among dispensary patients in the New York dispensaries and of child labor in the tenements of New York City The results of these investigations have been reported to the Board of Trustees from time to time by the Assistant Secretaries or appear in the various pamphlets and leaflets published by the Committee While detailed discussion of the results of these investigations is impos sible here the following general conclusions are submitted a In the Southern States the excessive length of the workday is universally a hardship upon the children in manufacture while the age limits prescribed by law low as they are are subject to almost universal violation owing to the lack of official factory inspection and of authentic evidence of the age of employed children b A reply to the argument that the glass factory depends for life upon the night work of little children is in the fact that the glass x50Secretarys Annual Report industry shows a greater increase in the states Ohio Illinois New York carefully forbidding the employment of young chil dren at night than in the three leading glass manufacturing states Indiana New Jersey Pennsylvania permitting child labor at night The age limit for employment in glass factories in Missouri Maryland and West Virginia is so low and em ployment of young children at night so extensive as to offer a serious menace to education and health c The employment of children in the soft coal mines varies accord ing to laws and industrial conditions The worst conditions thus far discovered are in certain sections of Pennsylvania although the employment of little boys underground is extensive in Mary land and West Virginia d The conditions of child employment in the mines and breakers of the anthracite coal region are slightly improved partly due to the awakening of public interest partly to the installation of mechanical devices The decrease in child labor thus far is slight however and the extent of the employment of boys rang ing frpm nine to fourteen years of age is virtually as reported to this Committee a year ago The vigor of the Mine Inspec tion Department in attempting to enforce the present inadequate law is gratifying In a recent order issued by the Chief Inspector of Mines he calls the attention of his deputies to the fact that deception as to the ages of working children is frequent and orders the aggressive prosecution of parents or employers who evade or disobey the law As repeatedly shown in reports of our investigations the mine inspectors are practically powerless to correct this great abuse of child labor until the law of Penn sylvania is thoroughly revised III TRAVEL AND PUBLIC SPEAKING The Secretaries have been in constant demand for public addresses on the subject of child labor The Secretary Dr Lindsay owing to the adminis trative duties of the office has been compelled to decline many calls for his ervices in public speaking but has frequently represented the Committee in this capacity in the Eastern the New England and the Middle Western States The activities of Dr McKelway from the Southern office cover a record of travel and work through the Southern States as far west as Kentucky Tennessee and Mississippi Mr Lovejoy has traveled through the North from the New England States to California addresses having been delivered in fifteen States Many other speakers officially representing the National Child Labor Committee have added to the number of public ad dresses in various parts of the country IV ORGANIZATION OF STATE AND LOCAL COMMITTEES State committees have been organized during the year in Maine Ken tucky and Nebraska local committees have been formed in Oklahoma City i5iThe Annals of the American Academy Okla Warren Ohio the Southwestern District of Baltimore and Grand Rapids Mich and the Pennsylvania Child Labor Committee has been re organized In process of formation at present are state committees in California Louisiana Mississippi Virginia and West Virginia Our state and local committees are steadily coming to a larger view of their opportunities Hitherto efforts have been largely confined to legisla tive campaigns The New York Maryland Missouri Kentucky and other committees are now active in the administration of scholarship funds and their reports at the third annual meeting and subsequent reports to this office attest the practical value of these activities V CHILD LABOR DAY In the early part of January a letter signed by representative clergymen in New York City was addressed to I2ooo clergymen representing Jewish Catholic and all the leading Protestant denominations in the United States requesting that Saturday January 25th or Sunday January 26th be set aside by the churches as Child Labor Day It was suggested that at least one service on that day be devoted to the discussion of child labor and to the consideration of national legislation and a law for the District of Columbia restricting the employment of young children This call met a very general response Many requests were received for the literature offered free of charge upon application and this led to subsequent correspondence with about 500 clergymen Numerous requests were received for literature to be distributed at the churches on the day specified Sermons were devoted to the subject in pulpits all over the country and several of these were later printed in pamphlet form for distribution Extensive publicity was given both by the daily and religious press to the necessity of the cooperation of the churches and to the subject of child labor in general Many church clubs and societies have since shown their continued interest by requesting stereopticon lectures and joining the associate and sustaining membership of the Committee VI PUBLICITY The report of the third annual meeting held in Cincinnati December 13 I906 was published in full in the January I907 number of THE ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science and the various papers ard addresses were published in separate reprints for distribution In addition a number of the earlier pages have been reprinted and other pamphlets and leaflets added especially for distribution in the exhibit at the Jamestown Exposition In November 1906 an arrangement was made with the Womans Home Companion to publish each month a department of official notes from our office and for twelve months one or more pages devoted to child labor were thus distributed to their 600000 subscribers At our request this plan was terminated with the October r9o7 issue In the various investigations photographs and descriptions have been collected and published either in our official pamphlets or through newspaper and magazine writers who have sought information from us 152Secretarys Annual Report 153 The publications of the Committee to the end of the third fiscal year have reached sixty in the serial number of pamphlets and sixteen in the series of leaflets The total number of documents issued is I80ooo and the total number of pages aggregates 2180000 Aside from our own publica tions the public has been informed of our work through the columns of many periodicals VII ExHIBIT At the meeting of the Board of Trustees April 22 I907 the Acting Secretary was authorized to prepare an itemized account of the expenses to be incurred including the extensive distribution of literature for an exhibit at the Jamestown Exposition Pursuant to this resolution a plan was drafted and the Committee received a special gift of 3000 for the pur pose The exhibit was installed in the Social Economy Building on August 20th Daily reports from the exhibit indicate that it is serving a valuable purpose especially in bringing to the attention of the Southern people the extent and conditions of child labor in various parts of the country During the month beginning September I5th Dr McKelway had been at Jamestown delivering a series of stereopticon lectures in the Social Economy Building The Committee also conducted a successful exhibit of its work at the New York State Conference of Charities and Correction at Rochester in November and at the Industrial Exhibit at Philadelphia in December I906 VIII FINANCES The receipts and expenditures of the Committee as shown by the Treas urers report for the third fiscal year are summarized in the following items

resignation from the secretaryship of Dr Samuel McCune Lindsay His administration of this office has been characterized by his recognized ability and great devotion to the interests this Committee was formed to serve Many attempts were made by the Trustees to retain Dr Lindsays servicesProceedings of the Fourth Annual Meeting but having become Director of the New York School of Philanthropy and Professor of Social Legislation at Columbia University it was impossible for him longer to bear the burdens of this office At the meeting of the Board of Trustees April 22d Dr Lindsays resignation was accepted and he was elected ViceChairman of the Committee Mr Lovejoy was appointed Acting Secretary The increased correspondence due to the plan of a popular associate membership has necessitated the enlargement of the office staff Our files now show a correspondence list of over 20000 names The material and facts regarding child labor collected by the Committee during the three years of its work have been placed at the disposal of the United States Commissioner of Labor and his special agents for aid in their investigation of the conditions of child labor authorized by Congress at its last session In consultation with the Chairman of the Committee the need was dis cussed for a thorough compilation of the official and scientific literature on child labor in European countries Through the kindness of Dr Isaac Adler such a compilation is to be made for this Committee by a wellqualified physician whom he will select for the work The Finance Committee May 27th made a careful review of the financial situation and directed that especial attention be given to securing additional contributions Through efforts continued during the summer new names were added to the membership list especially in the class of sustaining members and these together with other contributors have enabled the Com mittee to close the year with the credit balance shown in the Treasurers report OWEN R

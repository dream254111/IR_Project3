J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1078004,TEACHING LATIN TRANSLATION,I244683,TEACHING LATIN TRANSLATION G E RICKARD OAKLAND CITY INDIANA PROBABLY THE MOST INSISTENT OF PROBLEMS IN CONNECTION WITH LATIN TEACHING IS THAT OF TRANSLATION ONE HAS BUT TO RAISE THIS QUESTION WITH A LATIN CLASS WHAT IS YOUR MOST SERIOUS DIFFICULTY   TO GET THE ANSWER PROBABLY NOT IN EXACTLY THESE WORDS I CANT GET THIS JUMBLE OF LATIN WORDS TO MEAN ANYTHING THE WIDE SPREAD USE OF THE PONY IS THE PUPILS OWN UNGUIDED REACTION TO THIS SITUATION OFTEN THE LATIN TEACHER TO MEET THIS LATTER SITUATION AND WITH SINGULAR OBTUSENESS TO THE REAL HEART OF THE DIFFICULTY REDOUBLES HIS QUIZZINGS ALONG THE LINE OF CONSTRUCTION THUS EMPHA SIZING THE PURELY GRAMMATICAL PHASES OF THE SUBJECT THIS PROCESS IS DISCONCERTING ENOUGH TO THE PONYRIDER BUT GIVES HIM LITTLE HELP IN HIS FUNDAMENTAL DIFFICULTY THE TEACHERS TIME WOULD PROBABLY BE BETTER SPENT IF HE WENT CONSCIOUSLY ABOUT THE TASK OF TEACHING TRANSLATION AS A METHOD OF PROCEDURE THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENT WAS BEGUN IN SEPTEMBER I915 WITH A VERGIL CLASS OF 24 STUDENTS IN OAKLAND CITY HIGH SCHOOL PART OF THIS CLASS HAD HAD ONLY CAESAR PART CICERO ALSO THE COURSE WAS ELECTIVE AFTER SOME PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATION SUCH AS THE LIFE OF VERGIL THEME OF THE AENEID THE TROJAN WAR ETC WE TURNED TO THE PROBLEM OF TRANSLATION THE AIM OF THE COURSE WAS NARROWED DOWN TO INDUCE ON THE PART OF THE STUDENT A MAXIMUM OF TRANSLATING ABILITY AND TO HAVE HIM EXERCISE THAT ABILITY IN MY PRESENCE USUALLY IF A TEACHER ATTEMPTS TO ANTICIPATE ANY OF HIS STUDENTS DIFFICULTIES HE DOES SO BY POINTING OUT THE USAGES PECULIAR TO VERGIL BUT THESE CAN WELL BE ANTICIPATED IN THE ASSIGNMENT FROM DAY TO DAY WHILE THE PRELIMINARY ATTENTION OF THE PUPILS SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON THE MORE ELEMENTARY AND PROBABLY ELEMENTAL USAGES WHICH THE PUPIL HAS MET BEFORE BUT WHICH HE NEEDS TO HAVE REVIVED IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY BE READILY AVAILABLE IN ORDER TO MEET THIS LATTER CONSIDERATION WE SPENT THE FIRST TWO WEEKS DOING NOTHING BUT TAKING UP WORD AFTER WORD OF THE TEXT AND BY ITS ENDING INFERRING 215216 THE SCHOOL RE VIEW THE PROBABLE ENGLISH PHRASE BY WHICH IT SHOULD BE TRANSLATED WE AVOIDED LONG EXCURSIONS INTO GRAMMATICAL FIELDS OFTEN THE PUPIL DID NOT KNOW THE ENGLISH EQUIVALENT FOR THE WORD HIS ATTENTION WAS THUS FOCUSED ON THE ELEMENT COMMON TO ALL TRANS LATION NAMELY THE ASSOCIATION OF AN ENDING WITH A RANGE OF PROBABLE ENGLISH WORDS OR PHRASES THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF CONSTRUCTION FOR CONSTRUCTIONS SAKE FOR OUR PURPOSE IT IS NOT IMPORTANT THAT THE PUPIL KNOW THAT ENSE IS AN ABLATIVE OF INSTRUMENT BUT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT HE KNOW ITS PROBABLE PREPOSITION AS BY OR WITH THE PUPIL GAINS NO ADVANTAGE BY KNOWING THAT SIT IS A HORTATORY SUBJUNCTIVE BUT HE HAS GAINED WHEN HE HAS ESTAB LISHED THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE VERB FORM AND THE ENGLISH IDEA OF URGING AS EXPRESSED IN SUCH WORDS AS LET OR SHOULD THE PUPIL CAME READILY TO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT HE COULD NOT ALWAYS TELL THE USAGE OF A WORD FROM ITS ENDING THIS GAVE ME THE CHANCE TO SAY OVER AND OVER AGAIN NEITHER COULD THE ROMAN BUT HE WAITED UNTIL HE SAW IT IN RELATION TO OTHER WORDS THEN ONLY DID IT CONVEY A DEFINITE MEANING IN REVIVING THESE ASSOCIATIONS AS ABOVE THE TEACHER MUST USE ALL HE KNOWS OF THE LAWS OF ASSOCIATION THE EFFECT OF PRIMACY RECENCY VIVIDNESS FREQUENCY SIMILARITY AND LOGICAL SEQUENCES SOME OF THE ASSOCIATIONS FORMED IN FORMER YEARS MUST PERFORCE BE BROKEN UP THE PUPIL WHO FORMERLY HAS LEARNED THE SECOND PERSON SINGU LAR PRESENT SUBJUNCTIVE IN RELATION TO THE FIRST AND THIRD PERSON MUST COME TO KNOW THE FORMER AS AN ISOLATED UNIT WHOSE ENDING IMMEDIATELY TOUCHES OFF ITS ENGLISH ASSOCIATE TWO WEEKS DRILL ON THESE FUNDAMENTAL ASSOCIATIONS IN ADDITION TO TWO OR THREE YEARS PREVIOUS TRAINING ENABLES THE TEACHER TO SECURE RESPONSES INVARIABLY CORRECT RESPONSES WHICH INDICATE A WIDE AND ACCURATE RANGE OF ASSOCIATIONS OF ENDINGS WITH ENGLISH WORDS OR PHRASAL TRANSLATIONS HE IS THEN READY TO PROCEED TO MORE ELABORATE PROCESSES LEAVING THE ASSOCIATIONS OF LATIN WORDS PECULIAR TO VER GILS VOCABULARY WITH THEIR ENGLISH EQUIVALENTS TO BE ESTABLISHED FROM DAY TO DAY IN CONTEXTUAL SETTINGS AFTER THIS PRELIMINARY DRILL WE DIVIDED OUR CLASS PERIOD INTO TWO APPROXIMATELY EQUAL PARTS THE FIRST WAS GIVEN TO A FLUENT READING OF THE REVIEW AND ADVANCE TELLING THE STORY ETC THE LATTER HALF WAS GIVEN OVER TO MAKING THE PUPIL EXPLICITLY CONSCIOUS OF THETEACHING LATIN TRANSLATION 217 FACT THAT HIS PROBLEM WAS TO TRANSLATE FROM A LANGUAGE IN WHICH MEANING IS DEPENDENT UPON THE INFLECTION OF WORDS INTO A LANGUAGE IN WHICH MEANING IS DEPENDENT UPON POSITION OF WORDS I CHOSE SIMPLE ENGLISH SENTENCES TO SHOW THE LATTER AND SIMPLE LATIN SEN TENCES TO SHOW THE FORMER IT IS A CLEAR PRACTICAL GAIN WHEN A STUDENT REALIZES THAT THE WORD EUM BY VIRTUE OF ITS FORM AND QUITE REGARDLESS OF ITS POSITION RECEIVES THE ACTION EXPRESSED IN THE VERB WHEN THIS CONTRAST BETWEEN THE TWO LANGUAGES HAD BEEN MADE AS SHARP AS POSSIBLE I TURNED TO THE PROBLEM OF INCREASING THE RANGE OF THE PUPILS ATTENTIVE PROCESSES HE WAS INDUCED TO TAKE IN WORD AFTER WORD IN A POSSIBLE RELATIONSHIP BUT TO ALLOW HIS MIND TO REMAIN IN SUSPENSE UNTIL THE WHOLE SENTENCE HAD BEEN APPRE HENDED TO THIS END I TOOK UP WORD AFTER WORD OF NEW MATERIAL AND BY QUESTIONING ARRIVED AT ITS PROBABLE USE AND MEANING THEN I SAID HOLD THAT WORD IN MIND UNTIL YOU HAVE EXAMINED OTHERS IN THE SAME WAY ON TO THE END OF THE SENTENCE THEN YOU WILL REALIZE IF YOU WERE RIGHT IN YOUR PRELIMINARY CONJECTURE THIS HABIT IS BUILT UP SLOWLY HERE IS WHERE THE TEACHER SHOULD GIVE HIS PUPIL THE CHANCE TO SEE HIM TRANSLATE HE SHOULD NOT BE AFRAID TO THINK OUT LOUD HE SHOULD AFFORD HIS PUPILS EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO SEE HIS MENTAL PRO CESSES IN ACTION HIS PERPLEXITIES HIS ASSOCIATIONS HIS INFERENCES HIS SUSPENSION OF JUDGMENT AND FINALLY HIS SATISFACTION AS THE SENTENCE UNROLLS INTO A UNIT OF THOUGHT IN FORMER DAYS APPRENTICES LEARNED THEIR CRAFT BY WATCHING MASTERCRAFTSMEN AT WORK IF THE MASTER WAS PURSUING THE MOST ECONOMICAL METHOD OF PROCEDURE HIS APPRENTICE TOOK ON BY SHEER IMITATION AN EFFICIENT SKILL AND CONSEQUENTLY WAS SAVED THE WASTEFUL PROCESS OF ATRIVING AT HIS OWN METHODS OF PROCEDURE BY TRIAL AND ERRORGROPINGS IF THE MASTERCRAFTSMAN COULD HAVE ANALYZED HIS ACTS OF SKILL INTO THEIR ELEMENTS AND HAVE MADE HIS APPRENTICE DEFINITELY CONSCIOUS OF THESE THE LATTERS PROGRESS MIGHT HAVE BEEN MORE RAPID BY CONCENTRATING THE PUPILS ATTENTION UPON THE ELEMENTS IN HIS PARTICULAR ACT OF SKILL AND EXECUTING THE ACT COM PLETE BEFORE HIM THE MODERN TEACHER OF TRANSLATION MAY COMBINE THE ANCIENT PRINCIPLES OF CRAFTSMANSHIP WITH THE MODERN TEACHINGS OF THE EFFICIENCY EXPERTS BUT THIS IMPLIES PSYCHOLOGICAL AS WELL AS LINGUISTIC SKILL ON THE PART OF THE TEACHER218 THE SCHOOL REVIEW WHAT SHALL BE OUR FINAL TEST FOR CORRECTNESS OF TRANSLATION  IN MATHEMATICS THE PUPIL GETS THE ANSWER THIS IS HIS FINAL CHECK FOR CORRECTNESS OF PROCEDURE IN TRANSLATING THE CHECK IS NOT SO OBVIOUS THE BEST WE MAY HAVE IS THE SATISFACTION OF OUR SENSE OF CONSISTENCY WHEN THE ELEMENTS OF A SENTENCE HAVE BEEN ORGANIZED THEY MUST EXPRESS A COMPLETE THOUGHT WHEN A PUPIL HAS DECIDED UPON A RANGE OF POSSIBILITIES FOR A WORD AND HAS SEEN IT IN RELATION TO OTHER WORDS HE IS FORCED TO CHOOSE THE ONE BEST USAGE OF THE RANGE OF POSSIBILITIES BY WAY OF INDUCING THIS ABILITY IT HAS BEEN MY PRACTICE TO TRANSLATE ALL BUT THE GIVEN WORD OR PHRASE THUS LEAVING A BLANK TO BE FILLED IN BY THE PUPILS THIS IS SOMEWHAT ANALOGOUS TO THE GRAMMARGRADE PROCEDURE IN WHICH BLANKS ARE LEFT TO BE FILLED WITH APPROPRIATE EXPRESSIONS BY PUPILS IN BOTH CASES THE APPEAL IS TO THE PUPILS SENSE OF CON SISTENCY THOUGH IN BOTH CASES CONSIDERABLE SHARP QUESTIONING IS NEEDED TO SHOW FALLACIES IN THE PUPILS REASONING SUMMARIZING WE FIND THE FOLLOWING POINTS ENTERING INTO THIS MODE OF TEACHING I THE RECOGNITION OF THE TEACHING OF TRANSLATION AS A DEFINITE PROBLEM TO WHICH APPROXIMATELY ONEHALF OF THE USUAL PERIOD IS DEVOTED 2 THE REVIVAL OF THE ASSOCIATION OF LATIN WORDENDING WITH ENGLISH PHRASES AND MODES OF EXPRESSION 3 THE ATTEMPT TO MAKE THE PUPIL DEFINITELY CONSCIOUS THAT HE IS TO TRANSLATE FROM A LANGUAGE IN WHICH MEANING IS DETERMINED BY WORD INFLECTION INTO ONE IN WHICH MEANING IS DETERMINED BY WORD POSITION 4 THE BROADENING OF THE PUPILS ATTENTIVE PROCESS THUS ALLOW ING A SUSPENDED JUDGMENT 5 GIVING THE PUPIL THE CHANCE TO SEE HOW HIS TEACHER TRANSLATES 6 THE SATISFACTION OF THE TRANSLATORS SENSE OF CONSISTENCY AS A CHECK FOR CORRECTNESS I HAVE NO EXACT MEASUREMENTS OF THE RESULTS OF THIS TYPE OF TEACHING EXCEPT THAT THIS CLASS HAS MADE MORE RAPID PROGRESS THAN ANY OF SIX PRECEDING CLASSES THAT IT DOES SIGHTREADING WELL THAT THOSE PUPILS WHO HAVE HAD CAESAR ONLY DO THEIR WORK CREDITABLY AND NOT THE LEAST THEY ENJOY THEIR LATIN STUDYRECITATION

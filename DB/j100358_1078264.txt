Department of the Interior Pp 158z922 EDUCATIONAL WRITINGS 393 prepared to assume a constantly enlarging responsibility The administrative officer of the school system has frequently found his position difficult because of the lack of any authoritative definition of relationship between his position and the duties which have gradually become identified with it A recent study seeks to determine the actual relationship of the super intendent to the board of education and the activities it controls as this relation ship is defined by law and as it is understood by both school men and members of boards of education Following an introductory review of the historical development of the office of city superintendent of schools the author presents a summary of the results of his analysis of the laws of the fortyeight states as these relate to the problem of his study The superintendents relation to the board of education the public other municipal authorities other school officers local county and state is considered and the specific powers conferred upon him are classified Similarly the legal status of the city school superintendent in thirtyfour representative American cities is studied Here the city charter and special legislative acts relating to the administration of schools in individual cities or in cities of a given class are the sources of material The author finds that the authority to fix the responsibility for the exercise of various functions of city school administration is vested in the state legislatures and that this authority has been variously delegated to the electorate boards of education the super intendent and city county and state officials As regards special city charters it is found that practically no specific provisions for school adminis tration are made by special charters that are not also included somewhere in general legislation for city school systems p 98 The tabular summaries of the authors analyses of these documents are unfortunately presented on separate sheets not incorporated in the book An interesting chapter records the returns from a questionnaire sent to superintendents university teachers of school administration members of state departments of education and members of local boards who were asked to give their judgment concerning the powers the superintendent and the school board should properly possess Summarizing the replies of the different groups of individuals concerning the proper distribution of authority with respect to thirtyfive specified functions of school administration the author says The modal judgment gives a fairly complete picture of the judgment of the two groups and the responsibility that they would vest in the superintendent and board of education respectively The majority of the professional group would make the superintendent responsible for taking the initial step and also for executive action with the board approving either before or after action in each of the thirtyfive functions with the exception of appointment of secretary to the board of education and the various questions pertaining to buildings and grounds The appointment of the secretary they would leave solely with the board of education and for the various  JoHN CAYCE MORRISON The Legal Status of the City School Superintendent Baltimore Warwick  York 1922 Pp 162394 THE

the board of education The lay group would make the superintendent responsible for supervision of instruction and would make the board of education responsible for the appointment transfer and dismissal of all workers connected solely with the material side of the school plant for all functions pertaining to buildings and grounds and for the taking of the census For all other functions they would place the power of official initiative in the office of superintendent but differ as to the approval of administrative acts p II9 A final chapter presents an outline of the authors conception of the relationship that should obtain between the superintendent and board and between both these and other school officers The specific powers and duties belonging to each are given in detail The outline which does not include many new suggestions as to administrative practice probably reflects the best thought and practice as these are now generally understood The study has evidently been made with care and constitutes a valuable contribution to the literature of school administration N B HENRY

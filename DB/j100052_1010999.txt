Printed in GermanyINTRODUCTION This fifth annual issue of the Handbook reveals more clearly than its predecessors the utter lack of adequate protection for work ing children in the United States Not merely does the recurring black list of states and territories in the schedules show what re mains to be done in those states it indicates that the United States of America as a nation fails to rank with the enlightened countries of Europewith England France Germany Switzerland Holland and Scandinaviawhen classed according to its care of its working children Indeed it is with Russia rather than with these nations that the United States compares for Russia also permits little children to work all night The enlightened nations of Europe enact one law for the whole nation leaving to the local authorities only the duty of enforce ment The Congress of the United States enacts protective meas ures for instance for the benefit of the cotton and glass industries but leaves the protection of the children in those industries to the legislatures with the result that many thousand little boys in many states are left free to labor all night in glass works while both little girls and little boys work all night in cotton mills in the southern states The federal government does not even afford uptodate information concerning the children The census table given on p 64 is now seven years old The publication of this Handbook year after year by a volunteer organization is a standing reproach Far more appropriately might the Handbook have appeared for twenty years past as a January bulletin of the Department of Labor or of the Departcnent of Education or of both in coopera tion An important step forward will be taken when Congress adopts the proposed bill for a Childrens Bureau for research and publicity dealing with all conditions which affect the life health welfare and efficiency of the children of the nation The bill is given on page 53 A second bill still pending before Congress provides for the working children in the District of Columbia It is given in full in order that every reader of the Handbook may urge upon his or her senator and representative the necessity of voting for it that the nations capital may be removed from the black list and may become an example to the rest of the country See page 53 The third bill now pending before Congress is the Beveridge child labor bill see p 56 which proposes to exclude from inter state commerce all products of mines and factories which employ children under the age of fourteen years This bill marks an epoch in the history of federal legislation For the first time the princi ple is embodied in a proposed law thfat children in Georgia Florida or Alabama have the same right to childhood as children in Oregon or Illinois that the nation accepts the task of safeguarding its future citizens against overwork in childhood as it already protects I The Federal GovernmentHow Laws are Weakened consumers against the transportation of poisons and adulterations in their foodstuffs The present confusion of state laws inflicts cruel neglect upon children in states having least legislation It is moreover unjust to employers in the enlightened states to subject them to the com petition of industry in states which have no laws or sham laws protecting boys and girls Attention is called to certain principles which should be avoided in framing new laws and amending old ones The absence of a closing hour at night is a most serious weak ness in a child labor law No law affords real protection against nightworkthe greatest menace to the childrenunless it fixes a definite end of the working day This is also the only way to enforce laws restricting hours of labor by the day and by the week Without a closing hour all such restrictions are shams Attendance at an evening school by working children under the age of sixteen years should never be prescribed or tolerated This cruel and futile requirement was during I905 abolished in Massachusetts and replaced by the requirement that all children under sixteen years of age must be able to read and write in the English language before beginning to work Unfortunately the night school requirement abolished in one state was enacted in two others and is now in force in nine states The early escape from school leaves large numbers of children free to work too young Thus eleven states have no compulsory school attendance law In Maryland compulsory attendance ends at the twelfth birthday in Baltimore and Alleghany County and there is none elsewhere in the state in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island it ends at the thirteenth birthday and in seven teen states at the fourteenth The end of compulsory school life is the beginning of toil In eleven states where there are no officials there is no en forcement Where officials exist they are often appointed for political reasons and removed with every change of administration A black chapter of American history would be a full and truthful account of the removal of factory inspectors and labor commis sioners by reason of faithful performance of their duty No state has ever maintained a sufficient staff of officials for the perfect protection of its children Inspectors insufficient in number cannot enforce the law however faithful and competent they may be Money for salaries traveling and legal expenses is needed Small appropriations in some cases none whatever indicate hostility to enforcement The method of issuing working papers may contribute largely to weaken laws Certain states have recently placed the issuance of workingpapers in the hands of the factory inspectors It is however the duty of inspectors to inspect and to prosecute viola tions of the law Everything which calls them away from the continuous performance of these two duties is an injury to the service The appropriate officials for issuing workingpapers are the local boards of health in cooperation with the local boards of education In this respect the law of New York excels the laws of all the other states in proved efficiency and may well be adopted as the standard Notaries public and factory inspectors should be in all cases debarred from issuing  workingpapers  and factory inspectors should be kept strictly to the tasks of inspection and prosecution How far the present usage differs from this standard 2may be seen by reference to the records of prosecutions in schedule Hb and to the list of authorities issuing workingpapers in schedule E Faithfulness and skill on the part of officials who issue work ingpapers are as important as the same qualities in inspectors and truant officers Affidavits of parent or guardian still more their verbal or written statements are utterly worthless On this account the decision of Judge Staake of the Philadelphia County Quarter Sessions February I906 is the more to be con demned since it declared unconstitutional those sections of the Pennsylvania law which require proof of age and completion of an educational minimum Instead of the documentary proof of age and the educational requirement which the legislature prescribed such as other enlightened courts have held constitutional and de sirable the useless affidavit of parent or guardian is now accepted as proof of age in Pennsylvania Certain industries have hitherto obtained exemptions for which there is no tenable basis Thus in Pennsylvania the glass industry has retained the privilege of employing boys of fourteen years all night while other employers are restricted to nine oclock In Delaware Iowa Kentucky and Maryland canneries are exempted from the provisions of the law This is particularly injurious for the children because the busy season in this industry falls in the months of excessive heat rendering work peculiarly exhausting California exempts all agricultural horticultural viticultural or domestic labor during the time the public schools are not in session or during other than school hours This makes it possible to require children to do an unlimited days work in addition to going to school irrespective of their age In every state in which domestic labor is exempted a premium is placed upon work at home and the sweatingsystem is fostered Many child labor laws are seriously weakened by exemptions of classes of children who most need protection Such are orphans children of widowed mothers or disabled fathers and those ex empted by reason of poverty This last term is so elastic as to amount in many cases to complete nullification of the intent of the statute Colorado strengthens its child labor and compulsory education laws by means of its adult delinquency law This affords such valuable protection to telegraph and messenger boys and many other classes of young workers that it is given in full on p 50 in the hope that all the states may adopt it as Illinois Nebraska Wis consin and other states have already done A great gain is the lengthening list of states which have an early closing hour for children to the age of sixteen years This comprises Michigan Oregon Illinois Kentucky New York and Ohio Michigan and Oregon fix six p m the other states seven pm During the past year the District of Columbia adopted a com pulsory education law and the following states changed their child labor laws Georgia Iowa Louisiana Kentucky Maryland Massa chusetts and New York I 3 Adult Delinquency Law Recent GainsSCHEDULE AAGE LIMIT The Age Below Which Child Labor Is Prohibited varies from sixteen to ten years The number of employments prohibited also varies greatlyfrom all employment during school hours to mine work only Obviously the states which prohibit child labor in several occupations have more effective legislation than those which prohibit it in only one or two even though the age limit be the same Nine states prohibit employment under 14 years of age in stores factories and one or more of the following places of employment offices laundries hotels theatres bowling alleys bakeries eight states prohibit employment in stores and factories while twelve states limit their prohibition to factories only Twenty two states prohibit employment of children in mines to 14 years For the first time the states which set an age limit for the telegraph and telephone service are separately listed Eleven states prohibit employment in the messenger service under 14 years with certain exceptions in vacation one state Maryland under 12 years Washington and Wisconsin prohibit em ployment of girls under I8 in the messenger service Maine New Hampshire and Vermont are the only remaining rorthern states which keep the 2 year age limit in vacation The importance of this lies in the fact that all three states have cotton mills employing children Nebraska is the last northern state to keep the Io years age limit in vacation The District of Columbia Nevada and five territories have no age limit California Delaware Iowa Kentucky and Maryland have laws protecting certain classes of children but permit exemptions of an unusually wholesale characterleaving the children unprotected in canneries an industry in which the hours of labor inevitably tend to become irregular and exhaustingly long The pressure of competion of the cotton mills of Georgia and South Carolina upon mills in northern states is frequently urged as a reason for deferring much needed legislation in such states until Georgia and South Carolina effectively restrict the employment of children While the new law enacted July 1906 removes Georgia from the black list of states having no protection whatsoever for working children the present laws of the southern states will afford only a minimum of restriction upon employment of very young children until they provide for factory inspectors truant officers and effective registration of births The prominence of the District of Columbia as containing the capital of the nation and the fact that many children are employed there as messengers and in the street trades make it particularly desirable that the District should speed ily be removed from the list of states which have no age limit in the employment of children Group IAge Limit for Employment i6 Years IllinoisIn mines and dangerous occupations specified by law See Schedule F Dangerous Occupations

for children between thirteen and six teen years of age by restricting such night work to fortyeight hours in the week The District of Columbia and 28 states and territories fail to prohibit work at night after a definite closing hour Six states set an early closing hour for children under i6 years Michigan and Oregon fixing 6 p m and Illinois Kentucky New York and Ohio 7 p m Children have no positive immunity from night work unless the hours are explicitly stated between which it is unlawful to employ them Observance of laws forbidding night work is assured only when a legal closing hour is set This is especially true in the messenger service the glass industry retail stores and textile trades which employ children generally at night unless the closing hour is definitely fixed Those states which fail to restrict the hours of labor allowed in one week as well as in one day invite thepossibility of seven days labor In Washington for example women and girls may not only work ten hours at night they may do this every night including Sunday The District of Columbia and 13 states and territories have no time limit whatsoever California Delaware Iowa Kentucky and Maryland exempt

which attendance is required which varies from sixteen to twelve years 2 The length of the annual period of attendance which varies from the whole school year to eight weeks 3 Officers and penalties for enforcement see p 42 The most effective means of preventing illegal employment of children is compulsory school attendance throughout the entire period during which employ ment is prohibited Twentythree states now have this requirement If the law prohibits children from working under a certain age it should require them to be in school to that age during the entire school term of each year not a valueless period of a few weeks but eight months at least In states where children under the legal age of employment are not obliged to be in school all the year complica tions in the enforcement of the child labor law invariably arise because it is easy for parents to send their children to work under the legal age Thirteen states and territories have no compulsory education laws Of these Delaware is the only remaining northern state Maryland permits chil dren to leave school for work at the age of twelve years Pennsylvania and Rhode Island at thirteen Attention is asked to the coincidence between the list of states having no attendance laws and those having the largest number of illiterate children in the Census table on p 64 Exemptions from the compulsory education laws are granted in many states for one or more of the following reasons Physical or mental disability Private instruction Distance from school over two to three miles Poverty In a few states free clothing or other aids are granted on account of poverty Group IAttendance Compulsory to 16 if Unemployed ColoradoEntire school year exemptions granted to children over 14 if neces sarily employed or

County Group VINo Attendance Laws Alabama Alaska Delaware Florida Georgia Louisiana Mississippi North Carolina Oklahoma South Carolina Tennessee Texas Virginia SCHEDULE DEDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENT FOR EMPLOYMENT An Educational Requirement before children can be legally employed is found in states having the most advanced childlabor legislation This requirement consists of the completion of a specified curriculum ability to read and write English not always specified and a certain amount of school attendance Two states New York and Oregon require to a certain age proof of the completion of a specified curriculum before employment This require ment is particularly valuable in securing immunity from labor and the privi lege of school attendance for illiterate immigrant children In New York and Oregon children of 14 years may not work even though able to furnish proof of age unless they have had a fixed minimum of education as proved by their signed school record In New York the amount of school work required is that done by the normal child by the end of its twelfth year if regular in attendance and promotion In Pennsylvania signed proof of the completion of the curricu lum was required of children unable to furnish documentary proof of age by the law of 1905 but the requirement is now void since it was declared unconsti tutional February 19o6 Three other states Ohio Montana and Washington also require completion of a curriculum before employment but fail to require definite signed proof of compliance with the requirement Thirteen states require school attendance for a specified length of time before employment Fifteen states prohibit outright the employment of children who cannot read and write English Massachusetts requires children to read at sight and write intelligibly simple sentences in English enough for admission to the third grade in 1907 and fourth grade in 19o8 Connecticut Georgia and Illinois do not specify in what language children must be able to read and write Michigan requires English only if children have been in the United States over 3 years Seven states California Colorado Connecticut Illinois Maryland Minne sota and New Hampshire accept night school in lieu of day school attendance For children under the age of sixteen years this is an injurious requirement detrimental alike to health and education The District of Columbia and 22 states and territories have no educational requirement for children seeking employment  See p 64 Compare states having largest number of illiterate children 14Group I Children May Not

officials health officers factory inspectors or judges Of the I8 states which require documentary proof of age 14 give the issuance of papers to school authorities In New York working papers are issued by the health boards Since the New York law includes in its requirements the best minimum of education physical ability and satisfactory proof of age the New York pro visions concerning employment certificates are given in detail The importance of obtaining proof of age is ignored in the 13 states which accept the affidavit of parent or guardian unsupported by further proof This is worthless as a proof of age and places a premium on perjury School records are valuable for additional verification of age but the most reliable sources of information are transcripts of birth certificates certificates of baptism or pass ports In Pennsylvania documentary proof of age was required by the law of T905 but since this section of the law was declared unconstitutional February 90o6 the affidavit of parent or guardian is accepted The District of Columbia and 2 1 states and territories require no proof of age In ten states Delaware Indiana Kentucky Michigan Minnesota New

morals chiefly the employment of children where liquors are sold ropewalking and kindred exhibitions This is usually in the penal code and more or less completely nonenforced It is desirable to have it embodied in the labor law also and enforced by the factory inspectors This general provision is effective principally in case of damage suits following upon accidents to minors See p 61 Illinois and Ohio lead all the states in specifically prohibiting the employ ment of children under sixteen years in a list of manufactures involving many different kinds of dangerous machinery and in

deprivation of protection The most important exemptions allowing work under age have been em bodied in Schedule A These are exemptions of orphans children of disabled fathers or widowed mothers and the special exemption of the canning industry in several states The exemption of orphans from the protection of the law is especially to be deplored It places on children already handicapped the additional burden of wage earning at an age when according to the very statute which grants the exemption children in more fortunate circumstances need protection There remain to be noted the officials authorized to grant exemptions and the reasons for granting Exemptions for work over time are allowed for various reasons in fifteen different states AWORK IS ALLOWED UNDER AGE Authorities

enforcement Judges juries county and prosecuting attorneys probation officers truant officers and factory inspec tors figure in the varying processes of enforcement in the different states States which have no factory inspectors afford no adequate effective pro tection to working children When probation officers attached to juvenile courts make occasional arrests of employers it is not the prime duty of these officers to make systematic search for children in factories workshops etc and to ascertain the sanitary conditions under which work is done Truant officers also are insufficient for enforcing the closing hour and stopping night work The value of child labor laws depends upon the quality of the inspectors their tenure of office and the amount of money appropriated for their use Where factory inspectors are politicians and truant officers are aged and decrepit the children suffer accordingly The District of Columbia and 17 states and territories provide no special officials for inspection or enforcement Violation of the law may be prosecuted by the county attorney if complaint is made to him by any interested person Seven states have entirely given over to the school authorities the enforcement of child labor laws and in many others the truant officers as well as the factory inspectors are authorized to enter places of employment to demand certificates of age or schooling to make arrests and to enter prosecutions for violation through the prosecuting attorney The names and addresses of state labor officials charged with the enforce ment of child labor laws are included in order that any person in any state where such officials are appointed to enforce these laws may turn to this list to discover precisely upon whom the responsibility for enforcement or nonenforcement rests 29The list of names has been obtained by correspondence with the heads of labor departments of the various states It is possible that additional appoint ments have been made since these lists were received November 1906 No attempt is made to give the names and addresses of truant officers or school authorities owing to the obvious difficulty of obtaining accurate lists DIRECTORY OF OFFICIALS FOR ENFORCEMENT aState Labor Officials CaliforniaCommissioner of Labor salary 3000 Deputy salary i8oo assistants not exceeding 3 salaries not to exceed 4 per day

differing elements including the child the parent the employer the officials charged with the duty of enforcing the statutes and finally the community which enacts laws provides schools for the children when they are prohibited from working supports and authorizes officers for the enforcement of the laws prescribes penalties for their violation assists dependent families in which the children are below the legal age for work In the long run the effectiveness of the law depends upon the con science of the community as a whole far more than upon the parent and the employer acting together With the foregoing reservations and qualifications duly emphasized the fol lowing summaries are believed to outline the substance of the effective legislation which it seems reasonable to try to secure in the present and the immediate future They deal only with provisions for the child as a child taking for granted the pro visions for fireescapes safeguards for machines toilet facilities and all those things which the child shares with the adult worker An effective childlabor law rests primarily upon certain definite pro hibitions among which are the following LABOR IS PROHIBITED I for all children under the age of fourteen years 2 for all children under sixteen years of age who do not measure sixty inches and weigh eighty pounds 3 for all children under sixteen years of age who cannot read fluently and write legibly simple sentences in the English language 4 for all children under the age of sixteen years between the hours of 7 p m and 7 a m or longer than eight hours in any twentyfour hours or longer than fortyeight hours in any week 5 for all children under the age of sixteen years in occupations dangerous to life limb health or morals THE CHILD Effective legislation requires that before going to work the child satisfy a competent officer appointed for the purpose that it i is fourteen years of age and 2 is in good health and 3 measures at least sixty inches and weighs eighty pounds and 4 is able to read fluently and write legibly simple sentences in the English language and 5 has attended school a full school year during the twelve months next preceding going to work THE PARENT Effective childlabor legislation requires that the parent i keep the child in school to the age of fourteen years and longer if the child has not completed its required school work and This measure is not now specified in any statute though it is implied in the statute of New York enacted in 19o3 44THE EMPLOYER 2 take oath as to the exact age of the child before letting it begin to work and 3 substantiate the oath by producing a transcript of the official record of the birth of the child or the record of its baptism or some other religious record of the time of the birth of the child and must 4 produce the record of the childs school attendance signed by the prin cipal of the school which the child last attended Effective childlabor legislation requires that the employer before letting the child begin to work i obtain and place on file ready for official inspection papers showing a the place and date of birth of the child substantiated by b the oath of the parent corroborated by c a transcript of the official register of births or by a transcript of the record of baptism or other religious record of the birth of the child and by d the school record signed by the principal of the school which the child last attended and by e the statement of the officer of the Board of Education or the Board of Health designated for the purpose that he has approved the papers and examined the chiid 2 After permitting the child to begin to work the employer is required to produce the foregoing papers on demand of the schoolattendance officer the health officer and the factory inspectors 3 In case the child cease to work the employer must restore to the child the papers enumerated above 4 During the time that the child is at work the employer must provide suitable seats and permit their use so far as the nature of the work allows and must 5 post and keep posted in a conspicuous place the hours for beginning work in the morning and for stopping work in the middle of the day the hours for resuming work and for stopping at the close of the day and all work done at any time not specified in such posted notice con stitutes a violation of the law The total number of hours must not exceed eight in any one day or fortyeight in one week THE OFFICIALS Effective legislation for the protection of children requires that the officials entrusted with the duty of enforcing it x give their whole time not less thaneight hours of every working day to the performance of their duties making night inspections whenever this may be necessary to insure that children are not working during the prohibited hours and 2 treat all employers alike irrespective of political considerations of race religion or power in a community 3 prosecute all violations of the law 4 keep records complete and intelligible enough to facilitate the enactment of legislation suitable to the changing conditions of industry THE SCHOOL The best childlabor law is a compulsory education law covering forty weeks of the year and requiring the consecutive attendance of all the children to the age of fourteen years and until sixteen years unless they have meanwhile completed a specified portion of the curriculum as eight years in Colorado or five years in New York It is never certain that children are not at work if they are out of school In order to keep the children however it is not enough to compel attendancethe schools must be modified and adapted to the needs of the 45recent immigrants in the North and of the poor whites in the South afford ing instruction which appeals to the parents as worth having in lieu of the wages which the children are forbidden to earn and appeals to the children as interest ing and attractive No system of childlabor legislation can be regarded as effective which does not face and deal with these facts The vacation school and camp promise reinforcement of the childlabor laws which are now seriously weakened by the fact that the long vacation leaves idle upon the streets children whom employers covet by reason of the low price of their labor while parents greedy for the childrens earnings and anxious lest the children suffer from the life of the streets eagerly seek work for them Nothing could be worse for the physique of the school child than being compelled to work during the summer and the development of the vacation school and vacation camp alone seems to promise a satisfactory solution of the problem of the vacation of the city child of the working class THE COMMUNITY Effective childlabor legislation places upon the community many duties among which are i maintaining officialsmen and womenschoolattendance officers health officers and factory inspectors all of whom need a salary and traveling expenses b access at all reasonable times to the places where children are employed c power to prosecute allviolations of the statutes affecting working children d tenure of office so effectively assured that they need not fear removal from office in consequence of prosecuting powerful offenders 2 maintaining schools in which to educate the children who are prohibited from working 3 maintaining vital statistics especially birth records such that the real age of native children may be readily ascertained 4 maintaining provision for the adequate relief of dependent families in which the children are not yet of legal age for beginning work More important however than the enactment of the foregoing provisions is the maintenance in the community of a persistent lively interest in the enforce ment of the childlabor statutes Without such interest judges do not enforce penalties against offending parents and employers inspectors become discour aged and demoralized or faithful officers are removed because they have no organized backing while some group of powerful industries clamors that the law is injuring its interest Wellmeaning employers grow careless infractions be come the rule and workingmen form the habit of thinking that laws inimical to their interest are enforced while those framed in their interest are broken with impunity Upon parents there presses incessant poverty urging them to seek opportuni ties for wageearning even for the youngest children and upon the em ployers presses incessant competition urging them to reduce the payroll by all means fair and foul No law enforces itself and no officials can enforce a law which depends upon them alone It is only when they are consciously the agents of the will of the people that they can make the law really protect the children effectively 46A STANDARD CHILD LABOR LAW The best provisions of the law of New York Illinois and Massachusetts have been included in the Standard Child Labor Law which

PROVIDE FOR THE PUNISHMENT OF PERSONS RESPONSIBLE FOR OR CONTRIBUTING TO THE DELINQUENCY OF CHILDREN This valuable law known as the Adult Delinquency Law is of particular importance for children working in street trades for messengers and delivery boys and children whose work may bring them into immoral or dangerous sur roundings Under its provisions for example the saloonkeeper who sells liquors to a minor as well as the parent or employer who sends the child to a saloon are liable as contributors to his guilt Section I In all cases where any child shall be a delinquent child or a juvenile delinquent person as defined by the statute of this state the parent or parents legal guardian or person having the custody of such child or any other person responsible for or by any act encouraging causing or contributing to the delinquency of such child shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon trial and conviction thereon shall be fined in a sum not to exceed one thousand dollars i

Detroit Mich etchave ordinances regarding the work of children in street trades but none of them are so worded or so enforced as to be of any value Massachusetts and New York alone have state laws regulating the work of news boys The dangers of street trades for young boys have been ignored until within the last few years Investigation shows the physical and moral injury which these trades entail if unregulated The worst evils are i Irregularity of sleep and meals 2 Encouragement to truaficy and defiance of parental control 3 Nightwork 4 Introduction to many vices on the street In every community these conditions prevail unchecked to a greater or less degree In the absence of a more effective law the Newsboy Law of New York is printed in full with a brief statement of the provisions in which it is excelled by the Massachusetts law The method of enforcing the New York law is radically defective The statute requires the police to arrest offending newsboys and provides for trial before a court empowered to commit to reformatory institutions Three years experience proves that neither the uniformed nor the plain clothes police are willing or able to enforce this law As the act of selling on the streets out of school hours is a privilege which should be granted to school boys in good stand ing the enforcement of the law should necessarily be entrusted to the school

the Federal Government It is meant to fill the urgent need for uniformity of child labor laws in all the states a uniformity hitherto not even approximated by separate efforts of the individual states as this Handbook illustrates This bill if enacted into law will set a minimum standard below which the nation does not permit any of the states to fall The BeveridgeParsons Bill has been endorsed by the National Child Labor Committee and an effort to secure its enactment will constitute one of the Com mittees chief interests this winter Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled That six months from and after the passage of this act no carrier of interstate commerce shall transport or accept for transportation the products of any factory or mine in which children under fourteen years of age are employed or permitted to work which products are offered to said interstate carrier by the firm person or corporation owning or

Spencer Crim Nos 1332 86 Pacific Reporter p 896  This case involved four complaints relating to four different children employed under 14 years of age in the workshop and boiler room of a steamer the child not then having a permit to work from the judge of the juvenile court of the county and the time of employment not being in vacation of the public schools Judge Shaw for the court said The second clause of section 2 of the act provides that no child under fourteen years of age shall be employed in any mer cantile institution office laundry manufactory workshop restaurant hotel or apartment house or in the distribution or transmission of merchandise or messages provided that upon the sworn statement of the parent that the child is over twelve years of age and that the parent or parents are unable from sickness to labor the judge of the juvenile court in his discretion may issue a permit allowing such child to work for a specific time and provided further that during the time of the regular vacation of the public schools of the city or county any child over twelve years of age may work at any of the prohibited occupations upon a permit from the principal of the school attended by the child during the immediately preceding term Section 4 of the act declares that a violation of any of the provisions of the act shall be a misdemeanor The complaints charge violations of these provisions Several objections on constitutional grounds are made to the validity of the act It is claimed that it is special law for the punishment of crime where a general law could be made applicable and therefore contrary to sections 2 and 33 of Article IV of the Constitution of California that it is not of uniform operation but is discriminatory and hence in conflict with sections II and 21 of Article I and that it would deprive persons of the right to acquire and possess property thus violating section I of Article I of the State Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States The presumption always is that an act of the Legislature is constitutional and when this depends on the existence or non existence of some fact or state of facts the determination thereof is primarily for the legislature and the courts will acquiesce in its decision unless the error clearly appears Bourland v Hildreth 26 Cal 184 University v Bernard 57 Cal 612 In

West Publishing Co 57Law does not Discriminate Unfairly claring an act of the Legislature unconstitutional and void should never be exercised unless there is a clear repugnancy between the statute and the organic law    In a doubtful case the benefit of the doubt is to be given to the Legislature but it is to be remembered that the doubt to which this rule of construction refers is a reasonable doubt as distinguished from vague conjecture or misgivings Bourland v Hildreth supra From their tender years immature growth and lack of expe rience and knowledge minors are more subject to injury from excessive exertion and less capable of selfprotection than adults They are therefore peculiarly entitled to legislative protection and form a class to which legislation may be exclusively directed without falling under the constitutional prohibitions of special legislation and unfair discrimination The first objection to the validity of the part of the section above stated is that it is discriminatory and special because it does not prohibit such employment of minors in all occupations but only in those specifically mentioned that work at other places of which saloons barber shops railroads ferries and warehouses are specified by counsel as instances would be equally injurious and that in order to be general and uniform they should be included in the prohibition The objection is twofold first that the legislation constitutes an unfair discrimination against the par ticular trades mentioned second that it unduly and without reasonable cause restricts the right of minors to work at any and every occupation in which they may wish to engage There is nothing in the act to indicate a purpose on the part of the legis lature to make use of the laudable object of protecting children as a mere pretense under which to impose burdens upon some occupations or trades and favor others It appears to have been framed in good faith and for the purpose of promoting the general welfare by protecting minors from injury by overwork and facili tating their attendance at schools The legislature may undoubt edly forbid the employment of children under the age of fourteen years at any regular occupation if the interests of the children and the general welfare of society will be thereby secured and pro moted The power to forbid their employment in certain occupa tions and not in all depends on the question whether or not any appreciable number of children are employed in the callings not forbidden and whether or not those callings are injurious to them or less injurious than those forbidden If certain occupations are especially harmful for young children and others are not so there can be no serious doubt that it is within the power of the legis lature to forbid their employment in one class and permit it in the other The difference in the results would justify the classi fication with a view to the difference in the legislation Also if children are employed in certain occupations to their injury and are not employed at all in others or so infrequently that the number is inappreciable and insignificant the occupations regu larly employing them have no ground to complain of discrimina tion They compose the entire class to which the legislation is directed the class which causes the injury to be prevented And upon the facts assumed neither the children engaged in the occupa tions in which they are employed nor the persons would be affected by the prohibition as to other occupations The preliminary questions as to the effect of the specified occupations on the children and the number of children engaged therein are questions 58of fact for the legislature to ascertain and determine It has determined that the facts exist to authorize the particular legis lation If any rational doubt exists as to the soundness of the legislative judgment upon the existence of the facts that doubt must be resolved in favor of the legislative action and the law must accordingly be held to be valid in these respects The speci fications of forbidden callings are broad and comprehensive Even of these which as counsel assert are omitted from the classi fication we cannot say that a saloon is not a mercantile institu tion it being a place where merchandise is sold nor that a barber shop is not a workshop it being a place where a handicraft is carried on nor that ferries and railroads are not engaged in the distribution or transmission of merchandise or messages At all events in view of the rule that a statute must be liberally construed to the end that it may be declared constitutional rather than unconstitutional People v Hayne 83 Cal 11 7 26 Am  Eng Encyc of Law 640 we would not give the description of for bidden occupations this narrow construction in order to make the law invalid The decision of the legislature that the specified occupations are more injurious to children than others not men tioned and hence the subject of special regulation and that they constitute practically all the injurious occupations in which children are employed at all and therefore the only cases in which regulation is needed is not so manifestly incorrect not so beclouded with doubt concerning its accuracy as to justify the court in declaring it unfounded and the law consequently invalid There is a proviso to this clause of the section to the effect that if either parent of such child makes a sworn statement to the judge of the juvenile court of the county that the child is over twelve years of age and that the parent or parents are unable from sickness to labor such judge in his discretion may issue a permit allowing such child to work for a time to be specified therein There is no force to the objection that this discriminates orphans and abandoned children The exception allowed by the proviso is not made for the direct benefit of the child but for the sick parent It is a burden put upon the child because of the special necessity of his case which justifies the different provision respect ing him The legislature deems the necessity of allowing the child to work to aid in the support of the sick parent sufficient to outweigh the benefits which would otherwise accrue from the education and protection of the child during such inability If there are no parents whose necessities the childs labor could alleviate the reason for this exception is wanting The pro vision seems a reasonable one in view of the conditions upon which alone it can apply There is a further proviso or exception to the effect that any child over twelve years old may work at the prohibited occupations during the time of the regular vacations of the public schools of the city or county upon a permit from the principal of the school attended by the child during the term next preceding such vaca tion This does not as counsel contends give the principals of the public schools the exclusive power to give the contemplated permits Its true meaning is that the permit is to be given by the principal of the school which the child has attended whether the school is public or private but that it can extend only to the time of the public school vacation This act was approved February 20 I905 Its provisions relating to attendance upon 5 59Educational Requirements Constitutional schools and those of section x of the act of March 24 1903 Stats 1903 388 with the amendment of March o20 1905 Stats 1905 388 to said section I must be considered together The act of 1903 in effect requires all children to attend either the public schools or a private school during at least five months of the time of the sessions of the public schools The armendment of March so 1905 extends the time of such compulsory attendance so as to embrace the whole period of the public school session Therefore if the parents guardians or custodians of a child choose to send it to a private school it must attend thereon at least during the time the public schools are in session A permit may then be obtained for it to work during the vacation of the public schools if its interests or necessities so require without subjecting it to conditions substantially different from those affecting the children attending the public schools There is no discrimination The legislature has the power to make such reasonable regulations as these with respect to the time of the vacations of schools whether public or private in the interest of the public welfare and the welfare of the children A third clause of section 2 declares that no child under sixteen years of age shall work at any gainful occupation during the hours that the public schools are in session unless such child can read English at sight and write simple English sentences or is attending night school The first clause of section 2 provides that no minor under sixteen shall work in any mercantile institution office laundry manufacturing establishment or workshop between ten oclock in the evening and six oclock in the morning Section 5 of the act further provides that nothing in the act is to be con strued to prevent the employment of minors at agricultural viticultural horticultural or domestic labor during the time the public schools are not in session or during other than school hours The petitioners contention with respect to the first and last clause of section 2 is that they constitute such important parts of the statute that it cannot be presumed that the legislature would have adopted the other parts thereof if it had been aware of the invalidity of these particular provisions and hence the whole act must fall We cannot accede to this proposition They are separable and independent provisions and are not so important to the entire scheme as to justify us in concluding that the legis lature would have refused to adopt the other parts without these and thereby to declare the entire statute invalid Nor can it be conceded that these provisions are invalid The principles already discussed apply with equal force to the first clause of the section The proviso concerning illiterate children is a reasonable regulation to prevent those having control of such children from working them to such an extent as to hinder them from acquiring or endeavoring to acquire at least the beginning of an education before arriving at the age of sixteen years The exemption of domestic labor and the several kinds of farming from the operation of the act is not an unreasonable discrimination Such work is generally carried on at the home and as a part of that general home industry which should not be too much discouraged and it is usually under the immediate care and supervision of the parents or those occupying the place of parents and hence is not liable to cause so much injury These circumstances distinguish them from the prohibited industries and is a sufficient reason for the exemption We find no reasonable ground for declaring the law invalid 6oThe Supreme Court of Michigan on the application of the statute forbidding employment of minors under I6 years at any employment by which life or limb is endangered Sterling v Union Carbide Company xo5 Northwestern Reporter page 755 This case involved the application of a statute relating to the employment of children under i6 years of age any employment by which life or limb is endangered being thereby forbidden Sterling was under 16 years of age and was employed by the Union Carbide Company at putting sheets of metal through a corrugating machine While so engaged he attempted to remove a partly detached corner from one of the sheets and his hand was drawn into the rollers and severely injured Damages were allowed in the circuit court of Chippewa County and on appeal by the supreme court of the state Sterling testified that he knew he was liable to get hurt if his fingers got caught in the rollers and that it was dangerous to reach toward the sheet when it was nearly through but that he did not at the time have the danger in mind He also testified that he was given no instructions as to the operation of the machine Judge Montgomery for the court said in part It is insisted by appellants counsel that the employment of the plaintiff was not the approximate cause of the injury Whatever view may be entertained under statutes differently worded we think it entirely clear that the disregard of the inhibition of this statute by placing the plaintiff at work at an employment where his life or limb was endangered constituted the negligence or wrong of which plaintiff has the right to complain and that the causal connection between that wrong and the injury to plaintiff is clear Closely connected with this question is that of assumption of risk This question we regard as settled i e that in such cases the risk is not assumed The Supreme Court of Oregon on the Constitutionality of the Child Labor Law of zI95 State v Shorey 86 Pacific Reporter page 881 The defendant was accused by information of the crime of employing a minor under the age of 16 years for a greater period than ten hours a day in violation of section 5 of the child labor law of 1905 which reads as follows No child under sixteen years of age shall be employed at any work before the hour of seven in the morning or after the hour of six at night nor employed for longer than ten hours for any one day nor more than six days in any one week and every such child under sixteen years of age shall be entitled to not less than thirty minutes for meal time at noon but such meal time shall not be included as part of the work hours of the day and every employer shall post in a conspicuous place where such minors are employed a printed notice stating the maximum work hours required in one week and in every day of the week from such minors General Laws of Oregon 1905 p 343 A demurrer to the information was overruled and he entered a plea of not guilty Upon the trial it was stipulated that the averment of the information were true and he was thereupon adjudged guilty and sentenced to pay a fine and costs From this judgment he appeals claiming that the law which he is accused of violating is unconstitutional and void because in conflict with the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States which provides that no state shall depriv any person of life liberty or property without the process of law and of section I of article I of the Constitution of this state which reads We declare that all men when they form a social compact are 61equal in rights These constitutional provisions do not limit the power of the state to interfere with the parental control of minors or to regulate the right of a minor to contract or of others to contract with him 2 Tiedeman on State and Fed Con 195 It is competent for the state to forbid the employment of children in certain callings merely because it believes such prohibition to be for their best interest although the prohibited employment does not involve a direct danger to morals decency or of life or limb Such legislation is not an unlaw ful interference with the parents control over the child or right to its labor nor with the liberty of the child People v Ewer 141 N Y 129 36 N E 4 25 L R A 794 38 Am St Rep 788 affirming In re Ewer 7o Hun 239 24 N Y Supp 50oo Laws prohibiting the employment of adult males for more than a stated number of hours per day or week are not valid unless reasonably neces sary to protect the public health safety morals or general welfare because the right to labor or employ labor on such terms as may be agreed upon is a liberty or property right guaranteed to such persons by the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States and with which the state cannot inter fere Lochner v New York 198 U S 45 25 Sup Ct 539 49 L Ed 937 But laws regulating the right of minors to contract do not come within this princi ple They are not sui juris and can only contract to a limited extent They are wards of the state and subject to its control As to them the state stands in the position of parens patria and may exercise unlimited supervision and control over their contracts occupation and conduct and the liberty and right of those who assume to deal with them This is a power which inheres in the gov ernment for its own preservation and for the protection of the life person health and morals of its future citizens It has been well remarked says Mr Justice Gray in People v Ewer supra that the better organized and trained the race the better it is prepared for holding its own Hence it is that laws are enacted looking to the compulsory education by parents of their children and to their punishment for cruel treatment and which limit and regulate the employment of children in the factory and the workshop to prevent injury from excessive labor It is not and cannot be disputed that the interest which the state has in the physical moral and intellectual wellbeing of its members warrants the implica tion and the exercise of every just power which will result in preparing the child in future life to support itself to serve the state and in all the relations and duties of adult life to perform well and capably its part The supervision and control of minors is a subject which has always been regarded as within the province of legislative authority How far it shall be exercised is a question of expediency and propriety which it is the sole province of the Legislature to determine The judiciary has no authority to interfere with the Legislatures judgment on that subject unless perhaps its enactments are so manifestly unreasonable and arbitrary as to be invalid on that account It is not a question of constitutional power The constitutional guaranty of the liberty of contract says Mr Tiedeman does not therefore necessarily cover their minorsJ cases and prevent such legislation for their protection So far as such regulations control and limit the powers of minors to contract for labor there has never been and never can be any question as to their constitutionality Minors are the wards of the nation and even the control of them by parents is subject to the unlimited supervisory control of the state I Tiedeman on State and Fed Con p 335 And Mr Freund in his work on Police Powers says The constitutionality of legislation for the protection of children or minors is rarely questioned and the Legislature is conceded a wide discretion in creating restraints And Even the courts which take a very liberal view of individual liberty and are inclined to condemn paternal legislation would con cede that such paternal control may be exercised over children so especially in the choice of occupations hours of labor payment of wages and everything 62pertaining to education and in these matters a wide and constantly expanding legislative activity is exercised Freund Police Power 259 We are of the opinion therefore that the law prohibiting the employment of a child under sixteen years of age for longer than ten hours in any one day is a valid exercise of legislative power It is argued however that the pro visions of the statute forbidding the employment of such a child at any work before the hour of seven in the morning or after the hour of six at night is so manifestly unreasonable and arbitrary as to be void on that account The de fendant is not accused nor was he convicted of violating this provision of the statute and is therefore not in a position to raise the question suggested It follows that the judgment of the court below must be affirmed and it is so ordered 63UNITED STATES CENSUS 1900 Population Vol II Part II Table 65p 422 The following tables exhibit the actual numbers

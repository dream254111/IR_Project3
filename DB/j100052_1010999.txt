SOME RECENT JUDICIAL DECISIONS  58 CENSUS TABLE OF ILLITERATE CHILDREN 64 REPRINTED WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE ORIGINAL PUBLISHER KRAUS REPRINT CO A US DIVISION OF KRAUSTHOMSON ORGANIZATION LIMITED PRINTED IN GERMANYINTRODUCTION THIS FIFTH ANNUAL ISSUE OF THE HANDBOOK REVEALS MORE CLEARLY THAN ITS PREDECESSORS THE UTTER LACK OF ADEQUATE PROTECTION FOR WORK ING CHILDREN IN THE UNITED STATES NOT MERELY DOES THE RECURRING BLACK LIST OF STATES AND TERRITORIES IN THE SCHEDULES SHOW WHAT RE MAINS TO BE DONE IN THOSE STATES IT INDICATES THAT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AS A NATION FAILS TO RANK WITH THE ENLIGHTENED COUNTRIES OF EUROPEWITH ENGLAND FRANCE GERMANY SWITZERLAND HOLLAND AND SCANDINAVIAWHEN CLASSED ACCORDING TO ITS CARE OF ITS WORKING CHILDREN INDEED IT IS WITH RUSSIA RATHER THAN WITH THESE NATIONS THAT THE UNITED STATES COMPARES FOR RUSSIA ALSO PERMITS LITTLE CHILDREN TO WORK ALL NIGHT THE ENLIGHTENED NATIONS OF EUROPE ENACT ONE LAW FOR THE WHOLE NATION LEAVING TO THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES ONLY THE DUTY OF ENFORCE MENT THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES ENACTS PROTECTIVE MEAS URES FOR INSTANCE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COTTON AND GLASS INDUSTRIES BUT LEAVES THE PROTECTION OF THE CHILDREN IN THOSE INDUSTRIES TO THE LEGISLATURES WITH THE RESULT THAT MANY THOUSAND LITTLE BOYS IN MANY STATES ARE LEFT FREE TO LABOR ALL NIGHT IN GLASS WORKS WHILE BOTH LITTLE GIRLS AND LITTLE BOYS WORK ALL NIGHT IN COTTON MILLS IN THE SOUTHERN STATES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES NOT EVEN AFFORD UPTODATE INFORMATION CONCERNING THE CHILDREN THE CENSUS TABLE GIVEN ON P 64 IS NOW SEVEN YEARS OLD THE PUBLICATION OF THIS HANDBOOK YEAR AFTER YEAR BY A VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATION IS A STANDING REPROACH FAR MORE APPROPRIATELY MIGHT THE HANDBOOK HAVE APPEARED FOR TWENTY YEARS PAST AS A JANUARY BULLETIN OF THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR OR OF THE DEPARTCNENT OF EDUCATION OR OF BOTH IN COOPERA TION AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD WILL BE TAKEN WHEN CONGRESS ADOPTS THE PROPOSED BILL FOR A CHILDRENS BUREAU FOR RESEARCH AND PUBLICITY DEALING WITH ALL CONDITIONS WHICH AFFECT THE LIFE HEALTH WELFARE AND EFFICIENCY OF THE CHILDREN OF THE NATION THE BILL IS GIVEN ON PAGE 53 A SECOND BILL STILL PENDING BEFORE CONGRESS PROVIDES FOR THE WORKING CHILDREN IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA IT IS GIVEN IN FULL IN ORDER THAT EVERY READER OF THE HANDBOOK MAY URGE UPON HIS OR HER SENATOR AND REPRESENTATIVE THE NECESSITY OF VOTING FOR IT THAT THE NATIONS CAPITAL MAY BE REMOVED FROM THE BLACK LIST AND MAY BECOME AN EXAMPLE TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY SEE PAGE 53 THE THIRD BILL NOW PENDING BEFORE CONGRESS IS THE BEVERIDGE CHILD LABOR BILL SEE P 56 WHICH PROPOSES TO EXCLUDE FROM INTER STATE COMMERCE ALL PRODUCTS OF MINES AND FACTORIES WHICH EMPLOY CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF FOURTEEN YEARS THIS BILL MARKS AN EPOCH IN THE HISTORY OF FEDERAL LEGISLATION FOR THE FIRST TIME THE PRINCI PLE IS EMBODIED IN A PROPOSED LAW THFAT CHILDREN IN GEORGIA FLORIDA OR ALABAMA HAVE THE SAME RIGHT TO CHILDHOOD AS CHILDREN IN OREGON OR ILLINOIS THAT THE NATION ACCEPTS THE TASK OF SAFEGUARDING ITS FUTURE CITIZENS AGAINST OVERWORK IN CHILDHOOD AS IT ALREADY PROTECTS I THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENTHOW LAWS ARE WEAKENED CONSUMERS AGAINST THE TRANSPORTATION OF POISONS AND ADULTERATIONS IN THEIR FOODSTUFFS THE PRESENT CONFUSION OF STATE LAWS INFLICTS CRUEL NEGLECT UPON CHILDREN IN STATES HAVING LEAST LEGISLATION IT IS MOREOVER UNJUST TO EMPLOYERS IN THE ENLIGHTENED STATES TO SUBJECT THEM TO THE COM PETITION OF INDUSTRY IN STATES WHICH HAVE NO LAWS OR SHAM LAWS PROTECTING BOYS AND GIRLS ATTENTION IS CALLED TO CERTAIN PRINCIPLES WHICH SHOULD BE AVOIDED IN FRAMING NEW LAWS AND AMENDING OLD ONES THE ABSENCE OF A CLOSING HOUR AT NIGHT IS A MOST SERIOUS WEAK NESS IN A CHILD LABOR LAW NO LAW AFFORDS REAL PROTECTION AGAINST NIGHTWORKTHE GREATEST MENACE TO THE CHILDRENUNLESS IT FIXES A DEFINITE END OF THE WORKING DAY THIS IS ALSO THE ONLY WAY TO ENFORCE LAWS RESTRICTING HOURS OF LABOR BY THE DAY AND BY THE WEEK WITHOUT A CLOSING HOUR ALL SUCH RESTRICTIONS ARE SHAMS ATTENDANCE AT AN EVENING SCHOOL BY WORKING CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF SIXTEEN YEARS SHOULD NEVER BE PRESCRIBED OR TOLERATED THIS CRUEL AND FUTILE REQUIREMENT WAS DURING I905 ABOLISHED IN MASSACHUSETTS AND REPLACED BY THE REQUIREMENT THAT ALL CHILDREN UNDER SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE MUST BE ABLE TO READ AND WRITE IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE BEFORE BEGINNING TO WORK UNFORTUNATELY THE NIGHT SCHOOL REQUIREMENT ABOLISHED IN ONE STATE WAS ENACTED IN TWO OTHERS AND IS NOW IN FORCE IN NINE STATES THE EARLY ESCAPE FROM SCHOOL LEAVES LARGE NUMBERS OF CHILDREN FREE TO WORK TOO YOUNG THUS ELEVEN STATES HAVE NO COMPULSORY SCHOOL ATTENDANCE LAW IN MARYLAND COMPULSORY ATTENDANCE ENDS AT THE TWELFTH BIRTHDAY IN BALTIMORE AND ALLEGHANY COUNTY AND THERE IS NONE ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE IN PENNSYLVANIA AND RHODE ISLAND IT ENDS AT THE THIRTEENTH BIRTHDAY AND IN SEVEN TEEN STATES AT THE FOURTEENTH THE END OF COMPULSORY SCHOOL LIFE IS THE BEGINNING OF TOIL IN ELEVEN STATES WHERE THERE ARE NO OFFICIALS THERE IS NO EN FORCEMENT WHERE OFFICIALS EXIST THEY ARE OFTEN APPOINTED FOR POLITICAL REASONS AND REMOVED WITH EVERY CHANGE OF ADMINISTRATION A BLACK CHAPTER OF AMERICAN HISTORY WOULD BE A FULL AND TRUTHFUL ACCOUNT OF THE REMOVAL OF FACTORY INSPECTORS AND LABOR COMMIS SIONERS BY REASON OF FAITHFUL PERFORMANCE OF THEIR DUTY NO STATE HAS EVER MAINTAINED A SUFFICIENT STAFF OF OFFICIALS FOR THE PERFECT PROTECTION OF ITS CHILDREN INSPECTORS INSUFFICIENT IN NUMBER CANNOT ENFORCE THE LAW HOWEVER FAITHFUL AND COMPETENT THEY MAY BE MONEY FOR SALARIES TRAVELING AND LEGAL EXPENSES IS NEEDED SMALL APPROPRIATIONS IN SOME CASES NONE WHATEVER INDICATE HOSTILITY TO ENFORCEMENT THE METHOD OF ISSUING WORKING PAPERS MAY CONTRIBUTE LARGELY TO WEAKEN LAWS CERTAIN STATES HAVE RECENTLY PLACED THE ISSUANCE OF WORKINGPAPERS IN THE HANDS OF THE FACTORY INSPECTORS IT IS HOWEVER THE DUTY OF INSPECTORS TO INSPECT AND TO PROSECUTE VIOLA TIONS OF THE LAW EVERYTHING WHICH CALLS THEM AWAY FROM THE CONTINUOUS PERFORMANCE OF THESE TWO DUTIES IS AN INJURY TO THE SERVICE THE APPROPRIATE OFFICIALS FOR ISSUING WORKINGPAPERS ARE THE LOCAL BOARDS OF HEALTH IN COOPERATION WITH THE LOCAL BOARDS OF EDUCATION IN THIS RESPECT THE LAW OF NEW YORK EXCELS THE LAWS OF ALL THE OTHER STATES IN PROVED EFFICIENCY AND MAY WELL BE ADOPTED AS THE STANDARD NOTARIES PUBLIC AND FACTORY INSPECTORS SHOULD BE IN ALL CASES DEBARRED FROM ISSUING  WORKINGPAPERS  AND FACTORY INSPECTORS SHOULD BE KEPT STRICTLY TO THE TASKS OF INSPECTION AND PROSECUTION HOW FAR THE PRESENT USAGE DIFFERS FROM THIS STANDARD 2MAY BE SEEN BY REFERENCE TO THE RECORDS OF PROSECUTIONS IN SCHEDULE HB AND TO THE LIST OF AUTHORITIES ISSUING WORKINGPAPERS IN SCHEDULE E FAITHFULNESS AND SKILL ON THE PART OF OFFICIALS WHO ISSUE WORK INGPAPERS ARE AS IMPORTANT AS THE SAME QUALITIES IN INSPECTORS AND TRUANT OFFICERS AFFIDAVITS OF PARENT OR GUARDIAN STILL MORE THEIR VERBAL OR WRITTEN STATEMENTS ARE UTTERLY WORTHLESS ON THIS ACCOUNT THE DECISION OF JUDGE STAAKE OF THE PHILADELPHIA COUNTY QUARTER SESSIONS FEBRUARY I906 IS THE MORE TO BE CON DEMNED SINCE IT DECLARED UNCONSTITUTIONAL THOSE SECTIONS OF THE PENNSYLVANIA LAW WHICH REQUIRE PROOF OF AGE AND COMPLETION OF AN EDUCATIONAL MINIMUM INSTEAD OF THE DOCUMENTARY PROOF OF AGE AND THE EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENT WHICH THE LEGISLATURE PRESCRIBED SUCH AS OTHER ENLIGHTENED COURTS HAVE HELD CONSTITUTIONAL AND DE SIRABLE THE USELESS AFFIDAVIT OF PARENT OR GUARDIAN IS NOW ACCEPTED AS PROOF OF AGE IN PENNSYLVANIA CERTAIN INDUSTRIES HAVE HITHERTO OBTAINED EXEMPTIONS FOR WHICH THERE IS NO TENABLE BASIS THUS IN PENNSYLVANIA THE GLASS INDUSTRY HAS RETAINED THE PRIVILEGE OF EMPLOYING BOYS OF FOURTEEN YEARS ALL NIGHT WHILE OTHER EMPLOYERS ARE RESTRICTED TO NINE OCLOCK IN DELAWARE IOWA KENTUCKY AND MARYLAND CANNERIES ARE EXEMPTED FROM THE PROVISIONS OF THE LAW THIS IS PARTICULARLY INJURIOUS FOR THE CHILDREN BECAUSE THE BUSY SEASON IN THIS INDUSTRY FALLS IN THE MONTHS OF EXCESSIVE HEAT RENDERING WORK PECULIARLY EXHAUSTING CALIFORNIA EXEMPTS ALL AGRICULTURAL HORTICULTURAL VITICULTURAL OR DOMESTIC LABOR DURING THE TIME THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE NOT IN SESSION OR DURING OTHER THAN SCHOOL HOURS THIS MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO REQUIRE CHILDREN TO DO AN UNLIMITED DAYS WORK IN ADDITION TO GOING TO SCHOOL IRRESPECTIVE OF THEIR AGE IN EVERY STATE IN WHICH DOMESTIC LABOR IS EXEMPTED A PREMIUM IS PLACED UPON WORK AT HOME AND THE SWEATINGSYSTEM IS FOSTERED MANY CHILD LABOR LAWS ARE SERIOUSLY WEAKENED BY EXEMPTIONS OF CLASSES OF CHILDREN WHO MOST NEED PROTECTION SUCH ARE ORPHANS CHILDREN OF WIDOWED MOTHERS OR DISABLED FATHERS AND THOSE EX EMPTED BY REASON OF POVERTY THIS LAST TERM IS SO ELASTIC AS TO AMOUNT IN MANY CASES TO COMPLETE NULLIFICATION OF THE INTENT OF THE STATUTE COLORADO STRENGTHENS ITS CHILD LABOR AND COMPULSORY EDUCATION LAWS BY MEANS OF ITS ADULT DELINQUENCY LAW THIS AFFORDS SUCH VALUABLE PROTECTION TO TELEGRAPH AND MESSENGER BOYS AND MANY OTHER CLASSES OF YOUNG WORKERS THAT IT IS GIVEN IN FULL ON P 50 IN THE HOPE THAT ALL THE STATES MAY ADOPT IT AS ILLINOIS NEBRASKA WIS CONSIN AND OTHER STATES HAVE ALREADY DONE A GREAT

CALIFORNIA DELAWARE IOWA KENTUCKY AND MARYLAND HAVE LAWS PROTECTING CERTAIN CLASSES OF CHILDREN BUT PERMIT EXEMPTIONS OF AN UNUSUALLY WHOLESALE CHARACTERLEAVING THE CHILDREN UNPROTECTED IN CANNERIES AN INDUSTRY IN WHICH THE HOURS OF LABOR INEVITABLY TEND TO BECOME IRREGULAR AND EXHAUSTINGLY LONG THE PRESSURE OF COMPETION OF THE COTTON MILLS OF GEORGIA AND SOUTH CAROLINA UPON MILLS IN NORTHERN STATES IS FREQUENTLY URGED AS A REASON FOR DEFERRING MUCH NEEDED LEGISLATION IN SUCH STATES UNTIL GEORGIA AND SOUTH CAROLINA EFFECTIVELY RESTRICT THE EMPLOYMENT OF CHILDREN WHILE THE NEW LAW ENACTED JULY 1906 REMOVES GEORGIA FROM THE BLACK LIST OF STATES HAVING NO PROTECTION WHATSOEVER FOR WORKING CHILDREN THE PRESENT LAWS OF THE SOUTHERN STATES WILL AFFORD ONLY A MINIMUM OF RESTRICTION UPON EMPLOYMENT OF VERY YOUNG CHILDREN UNTIL THEY PROVIDE FOR FACTORY INSPECTORS TRUANT OFFICERS AND EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION OF BIRTHS THE PROMINENCE OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AS CONTAINING THE CAPITAL OF THE NATION AND THE FACT THAT MANY CHILDREN ARE EMPLOYED THERE AS MESSENGERS AND IN THE STREET TRADES MAKE IT PARTICULARLY DESIRABLE THAT THE DISTRICT SHOULD SPEED ILY BE REMOVED FROM THE LIST OF

CHILDREN WHEN THEY ARE PROHIBITED FROM WORKING SUPPORTS AND AUTHORIZES OFFICERS FOR THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAWS PRESCRIBES PENALTIES FOR THEIR VIOLATION ASSISTS DEPENDENT FAMILIES IN WHICH THE CHILDREN ARE BELOW THE LEGAL AGE FOR WORK IN THE LONG RUN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE LAW DEPENDS UPON THE CON SCIENCE OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE FAR MORE THAN UPON THE PARENT AND THE EMPLOYER ACTING TOGETHER WITH THE FOREGOING RESERVATIONS AND QUALIFICATIONS DULY EMPHASIZED THE FOL LOWING SUMMARIES ARE BELIEVED TO OUTLINE THE SUBSTANCE OF THE EFFECTIVE LEGISLATION WHICH IT SEEMS REASONABLE TO TRY TO SECURE IN THE PRESENT AND THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE THEY DEAL ONLY WITH PROVISIONS FOR THE CHILD AS A CHILD TAKING FOR GRANTED THE PRO VISIONS FOR FIREESCAPES SAFEGUARDS FOR MACHINES TOILET FACILITIES

CHILD NOT THEN HAVING A PERMIT TO WORK FROM THE JUDGE OF THE JUVENILE COURT OF THE COUNTY AND THE TIME OF EMPLOYMENT NOT BEING IN VACATION OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS JUDGE SHAW FOR THE COURT SAID THE SECOND CLAUSE OF SECTION 2 OF THE ACT PROVIDES THAT NO CHILD UNDER FOURTEEN YEARS OF AGE SHALL BE EMPLOYED IN ANY MER CANTILE INSTITUTION OFFICE LAUNDRY MANUFACTORY WORKSHOP RESTAURANT HOTEL OR APARTMENT HOUSE OR IN THE DISTRIBUTION OR TRANSMISSION OF MERCHANDISE OR MESSAGES PROVIDED THAT UPON THE SWORN STATEMENT OF THE PARENT THAT THE CHILD IS OVER TWELVE YEARS OF AGE AND THAT THE PARENT OR PARENTS ARE UNABLE FROM SICKNESS TO LABOR THE JUDGE OF THE JUVENILE COURT IN HIS DISCRETION MAY ISSUE A PERMIT ALLOWING SUCH CHILD TO WORK FOR A SPECIFIC TIME AND PROVIDED FURTHER THAT DURING THE TIME OF THE REGULAR VACATION OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF THE CITY OR COUNTY ANY CHILD OVER TWELVE YEARS OF AGE MAY WORK AT ANY OF THE PROHIBITED OCCUPATIONS UPON A PERMIT FROM THE PRINCIPAL OF THE SCHOOL ATTENDED BY THE CHILD DURING THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING TERM SECTION 4 OF THE ACT DECLARES THAT A VIOLATION OF ANY OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE ACT SHALL BE A MISDEMEANOR THE COMPLAINTS CHARGE VIOLATIONS OF THESE PROVISIONS SEVERAL OBJECTIONS ON CONSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS ARE MADE TO THE VALIDITY OF THE ACT IT IS CLAIMED THAT IT IS SPECIAL LAW FOR THE PUNISHMENT OF CRIME WHERE A GENERAL LAW COULD BE MADE APPLICABLE AND THEREFORE CONTRARY TO SECTIONS 2 AND 33 OF ARTICLE IV OF THE CONSTITUTION OF CALIFORNIA THAT IT IS NOT OF UNIFORM OPERATION BUT IS DISCRIMINATORY AND HENCE IN CONFLICT WITH SECTIONS II AND 21 OF ARTICLE I AND THAT IT WOULD DEPRIVE PERSONS OF THE RIGHT TO ACQUIRE AND POSSESS PROPERTY THUS VIOLATING SECTION I OF ARTICLE I OF THE STATE CONSTITUTION AND THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES THE PRESUMPTION ALWAYS IS THAT AN ACT OF THE LEGISLATURE IS CONSTITUTIONAL AND WHEN THIS DEPENDS ON THE EXISTENCE OR NON EXISTENCE OF SOME FACT OR STATE OF FACTS THE DETERMINATION THEREOF IS PRIMARILY FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND THE COURTS WILL ACQUIESCE IN ITS DECISION UNLESS THE ERROR CLEARLY APPEARS BOURLAND V HILDRETH 26 CAL 184 UNIVERSITY V BERNARD 57 CAL 612 IN

THE ORGANIC LAW    IN A DOUBTFUL CASE THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT IS TO BE GIVEN TO THE LEGISLATURE BUT IT IS TO BE REMEMBERED THAT THE DOUBT TO WHICH THIS RULE OF CONSTRUCTION REFERS IS A REASONABLE

DIRECTED WITHOUT FALLING UNDER THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROHIBITIONS OF SPECIAL LEGISLATION AND UNFAIR DISCRIMINATION THE FIRST OBJECTION TO THE VALIDITY OF THE PART OF THE SECTION ABOVE STATED IS THAT IT IS DISCRIMINATORY AND SPECIAL BECAUSE IT DOES NOT PROHIBIT SUCH EMPLOYMENT OF MINORS IN ALL OCCUPATIONS BUT ONLY IN THOSE SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED THAT WORK AT OTHER PLACES OF WHICH SALOONS BARBER SHOPS RAILROADS FERRIES AND WAREHOUSES ARE SPECIFIED BY COUNSEL AS INSTANCES WOULD BE EQUALLY INJURIOUS AND THAT IN ORDER TO BE GENERAL AND UNIFORM THEY SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE PROHIBITION THE OBJECTION IS TWOFOLD FIRST THAT THE LEGISLATION CONSTITUTES AN UNFAIR DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE PAR TICULAR TRADES MENTIONED SECOND THAT IT UNDULY AND WITHOUT REASONABLE CAUSE RESTRICTS THE RIGHT OF MINORS TO WORK AT ANY AND EVERY OCCUPATION IN WHICH THEY MAY WISH TO ENGAGE THERE IS NOTHING IN THE ACT TO INDICATE A PURPOSE ON THE PART OF THE LEGIS LATURE TO MAKE USE OF THE LAUDABLE OBJECT OF PROTECTING CHILDREN AS A MERE PRETENSE UNDER WHICH TO IMPOSE BURDENS UPON SOME OCCUPATIONS OR TRADES AND FAVOR OTHERS IT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN FRAMED IN GOOD FAITH AND FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROMOTING THE GENERAL WELFARE BY PROTECTING MINORS FROM INJURY BY OVERWORK AND FACILI TATING THEIR ATTENDANCE AT SCHOOLS THE LEGISLATURE MAY UNDOUBT EDLY FORBID THE EMPLOYMENT OF CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF FOURTEEN YEARS AT ANY REGULAR OCCUPATION IF THE INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN AND THE GENERAL WELFARE OF SOCIETY WILL BE THEREBY SECURED AND PRO MOTED THE POWER TO FORBID THEIR EMPLOYMENT IN CERTAIN OCCUPA TIONS AND NOT IN ALL DEPENDS ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT ANY APPRECIABLE NUMBER OF CHILDREN ARE EMPLOYED IN THE CALLINGS NOT FORBIDDEN AND WHETHER OR NOT THOSE CALLINGS ARE INJURIOUS TO THEM OR LESS INJURIOUS THAN THOSE FORBIDDEN IF CERTAIN OCCUPATIONS ARE ESPECIALLY HARMFUL FOR YOUNG CHILDREN AND OTHERS ARE NOT SO THERE CAN BE NO SERIOUS DOUBT THAT IT IS WITHIN THE POWER OF THE LEGIS LATURE TO FORBID THEIR EMPLOYMENT IN ONE CLASS AND PERMIT IT IN THE OTHER THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RESULTS WOULD JUSTIFY THE CLASSI FICATION WITH A VIEW TO THE DIFFERENCE IN THE LEGISLATION ALSO IF CHILDREN ARE EMPLOYED IN CERTAIN OCCUPATIONS TO THEIR INJURY AND ARE NOT EMPLOYED AT ALL IN OTHERS OR SO INFREQUENTLY THAT THE NUMBER IS INAPPRECIABLE AND INSIGNIFICANT THE OCCUPATIONS REGU LARLY EMPLOYING THEM HAVE NO GROUND TO COMPLAIN OF DISCRIMINA TION THEY COMPOSE THE ENTIRE CLASS TO WHICH THE LEGISLATION IS DIRECTED THE CLASS WHICH CAUSES THE INJURY TO BE PREVENTED AND UPON THE FACTS ASSUMED NEITHER THE CHILDREN ENGAGED IN THE OCCUPA TIONS IN WHICH THEY ARE EMPLOYED NOR THE PERSONS WOULD BE AFFECTED BY THE PROHIBITION AS TO OTHER OCCUPATIONS THE PRELIMINARY QUESTIONS AS TO THE EFFECT OF THE SPECIFIED OCCUPATIONS ON THE CHILDREN AND THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN ENGAGED THEREIN ARE QUESTIONS 58OF FACT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ASCERTAIN AND DETERMINE IT HAS DETERMINED THAT THE FACTS EXIST TO AUTHORIZE THE PARTICULAR LEGIS LATION IF ANY RATIONAL DOUBT EXISTS AS TO THE SOUNDNESS OF THE LEGISLATIVE JUDGMENT UPON THE EXISTENCE OF THE FACTS THAT DOUBT MUST BE RESOLVED IN FAVOR OF THE LEGISLATIVE ACTION AND THE LAW MUST ACCORDINGLY BE HELD TO BE VALID IN THESE RESPECTS THE SPECI FICATIONS OF FORBIDDEN CALLINGS ARE BROAD AND COMPREHENSIVE EVEN OF THESE WHICH AS COUNSEL ASSERT ARE OMITTED FROM THE CLASSI FICATION WE CANNOT SAY THAT A SALOON IS NOT A MERCANTILE INSTITU TION IT BEING A PLACE WHERE MERCHANDISE IS SOLD NOR THAT A BARBER SHOP IS NOT A WORKSHOP IT BEING A PLACE WHERE A HANDICRAFT IS CARRIED ON NOR THAT FERRIES AND RAILROADS ARE NOT ENGAGED IN THE DISTRIBUTION OR TRANSMISSION OF MERCHANDISE OR MESSAGES AT ALL EVENTS IN VIEW OF THE RULE THAT A STATUTE MUST BE LIBERALLY CONSTRUED TO THE END THAT IT MAY BE DECLARED CONSTITUTIONAL RATHER THAN UNCONSTITUTIONAL PEOPLE V HAYNE 83 CAL 11 7 26 AM  ENG ENCYC OF LAW 640 WE WOULD NOT GIVE THE DESCRIPTION OF FOR BIDDEN OCCUPATIONS THIS NARROW CONSTRUCTION IN ORDER TO MAKE THE LAW INVALID THE DECISION OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT THE SPECIFIED OCCUPATIONS ARE MORE INJURIOUS TO CHILDREN THAN OTHERS NOT MEN TIONED AND HENCE THE SUBJECT OF SPECIAL REGULATION AND THAT THEY CONSTITUTE PRACTICALLY ALL THE INJURIOUS OCCUPATIONS IN WHICH CHILDREN ARE EMPLOYED AT ALL AND THEREFORE THE ONLY CASES IN WHICH REGULATION IS NEEDED IS NOT SO MANIFESTLY INCORRECT NOT SO BECLOUDED WITH DOUBT CONCERNING ITS ACCURACY AS TO JUSTIFY THE COURT IN DECLARING IT UNFOUNDED AND THE LAW CONSEQUENTLY INVALID THERE IS A PROVISO TO THIS CLAUSE OF THE SECTION TO THE EFFECT THAT IF EITHER PARENT OF SUCH CHILD MAKES A SWORN STATEMENT TO THE JUDGE OF THE JUVENILE COURT OF THE COUNTY THAT THE CHILD IS OVER TWELVE YEARS OF AGE AND THAT THE PARENT OR PARENTS ARE UNABLE FROM SICKNESS TO LABOR SUCH JUDGE IN HIS DISCRETION MAY ISSUE A PERMIT ALLOWING SUCH CHILD TO WORK FOR A TIME TO BE SPECIFIED THEREIN THERE IS NO FORCE TO THE OBJECTION THAT THIS DISCRIMINATES ORPHANS AND ABANDONED CHILDREN THE EXCEPTION ALLOWED BY THE PROVISO IS NOT MADE FOR THE DIRECT BENEFIT OF THE CHILD BUT FOR THE SICK PARENT IT IS A BURDEN PUT UPON THE CHILD BECAUSE OF THE SPECIAL NECESSITY OF HIS CASE WHICH JUSTIFIES THE DIFFERENT PROVISION RESPECT ING HIM THE LEGISLATURE DEEMS THE NECESSITY OF ALLOWING THE CHILD TO WORK TO AID IN THE SUPPORT OF THE SICK PARENT SUFFICIENT TO OUTWEIGH THE BENEFITS WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE ACCRUE FROM THE EDUCATION AND PROTECTION OF THE CHILD DURING SUCH INABILITY IF THERE ARE NO PARENTS WHOSE NECESSITIES THE CHILDS LABOR COULD ALLEVIATE THE REASON FOR THIS EXCEPTION IS WANTING THE PRO VISION SEEMS A REASONABLE ONE IN VIEW OF THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH ALONE IT CAN APPLY THERE IS A FURTHER PROVISO OR EXCEPTION TO THE EFFECT THAT ANY CHILD OVER TWELVE YEARS OLD MAY WORK AT THE PROHIBITED OCCUPATIONS DURING THE TIME OF THE REGULAR VACATIONS OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF THE CITY OR COUNTY UPON A PERMIT FROM THE PRINCIPAL OF THE SCHOOL ATTENDED BY THE CHILD DURING THE TERM NEXT PRECEDING SUCH VACA TION THIS DOES NOT AS COUNSEL CONTENDS GIVE THE PRINCIPALS OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS THE EXCLUSIVE POWER TO GIVE THE CONTEMPLATED PERMITS ITS TRUE MEANING IS THAT THE PERMIT IS TO BE GIVEN BY THE PRINCIPAL OF THE SCHOOL WHICH THE CHILD HAS ATTENDED WHETHER THE SCHOOL IS PUBLIC OR PRIVATE BUT THAT IT CAN EXTEND ONLY TO THE TIME OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL VACATION THIS ACT WAS APPROVED FEBRUARY 20 I905 ITS PROVISIONS RELATING TO ATTENDANCE UPON 5 59EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOOLS AND THOSE OF SECTION X OF THE ACT OF MARCH 24 1903 STATS 1903 388 WITH THE AMENDMENT OF MARCH O20 1905 STATS 1905 388 TO SAID SECTION I MUST BE CONSIDERED TOGETHER THE ACT OF 1903 IN EFFECT REQUIRES ALL CHILDREN TO ATTEND EITHER THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OR A PRIVATE SCHOOL DURING AT LEAST FIVE MONTHS OF THE TIME OF THE SESSIONS OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS THE ARMENDMENT OF MARCH SO 1905 EXTENDS THE TIME OF SUCH COMPULSORY ATTENDANCE SO AS TO EMBRACE THE WHOLE PERIOD OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SESSION THEREFORE IF THE PARENTS GUARDIANS OR CUSTODIANS OF A CHILD CHOOSE TO SEND IT TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL IT MUST ATTEND THEREON AT LEAST DURING THE TIME THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE IN SESSION A PERMIT MAY THEN BE OBTAINED FOR IT TO WORK DURING THE VACATION OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS IF ITS INTERESTS OR NECESSITIES SO REQUIRE WITHOUT SUBJECTING IT TO CONDITIONS SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE AFFECTING THE CHILDREN ATTENDING THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS THERE IS NO DISCRIMINATION THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE POWER TO MAKE SUCH REASONABLE REGULATIONS AS THESE WITH RESPECT TO THE TIME OF THE VACATIONS OF SCHOOLS WHETHER PUBLIC OR PRIVATE IN THE INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC WELFARE AND THE WELFARE OF THE CHILDREN A THIRD CLAUSE OF SECTION 2 DECLARES THAT NO CHILD UNDER SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE SHALL WORK AT ANY GAINFUL OCCUPATION DURING THE HOURS THAT THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE IN SESSION UNLESS SUCH CHILD CAN READ ENGLISH AT SIGHT AND WRITE SIMPLE ENGLISH SENTENCES OR IS ATTENDING NIGHT SCHOOL THE FIRST CLAUSE OF SECTION 2 PROVIDES THAT NO MINOR UNDER SIXTEEN SHALL WORK IN ANY MERCANTILE INSTITUTION OFFICE LAUNDRY MANUFACTURING ESTABLISHMENT OR WORKSHOP BETWEEN TEN OCLOCK IN THE EVENING AND SIX OCLOCK IN THE MORNING SECTION 5 OF THE ACT FURTHER PROVIDES THAT NOTHING IN THE ACT IS TO BE CON STRUED TO PREVENT THE EMPLOYMENT OF MINORS AT AGRICULTURAL VITICULTURAL HORTICULTURAL OR DOMESTIC LABOR DURING THE TIME THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE NOT IN SESSION OR DURING OTHER THAN SCHOOL HOURS THE PETITIONERS CONTENTION WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST AND LAST CLAUSE OF SECTION 2 IS THAT THEY CONSTITUTE SUCH IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE STATUTE THAT IT CANNOT BE PRESUMED THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE ADOPTED THE OTHER PARTS THEREOF IF IT HAD BEEN AWARE OF THE INVALIDITY OF THESE PARTICULAR PROVISIONS AND HENCE THE WHOLE ACT MUST FALL WE CANNOT ACCEDE TO THIS PROPOSITION THEY ARE SEPARABLE AND INDEPENDENT PROVISIONS AND ARE NOT SO IMPORTANT TO THE ENTIRE SCHEME AS TO JUSTIFY US IN CONCLUDING THAT THE LEGIS LATURE WOULD HAVE REFUSED TO ADOPT THE OTHER PARTS WITHOUT THESE AND THEREBY TO DECLARE THE ENTIRE STATUTE INVALID NOR CAN IT BE CONCEDED THAT THESE PROVISIONS ARE INVALID THE PRINCIPLES ALREADY DISCUSSED APPLY WITH EQUAL FORCE TO THE FIRST CLAUSE OF THE SECTION THE PROVISO CONCERNING ILLITERATE CHILDREN IS A REASONABLE REGULATION TO PREVENT THOSE HAVING CONTROL OF SUCH CHILDREN FROM WORKING THEM TO SUCH AN EXTENT AS TO HINDER THEM FROM ACQUIRING OR ENDEAVORING TO ACQUIRE AT LEAST THE BEGINNING OF AN EDUCATION BEFORE ARRIVING AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN YEARS THE EXEMPTION OF DOMESTIC LABOR AND THE SEVERAL KINDS OF FARMING FROM THE OPERATION OF THE ACT IS NOT AN UNREASONABLE DISCRIMINATION SUCH WORK IS GENERALLY CARRIED ON AT THE HOME AND AS A PART OF THAT GENERAL HOME INDUSTRY WHICH SHOULD NOT BE TOO MUCH DISCOURAGED AND IT IS USUALLY UNDER THE IMMEDIATE CARE AND SUPERVISION OF THE PARENTS OR THOSE OCCUPYING THE PLACE OF PARENTS AND HENCE IS NOT LIABLE TO CAUSE SO MUCH INJURY THESE CIRCUMSTANCES DISTINGUISH THEM FROM THE PROHIBITED INDUSTRIES AND IS A SUFFICIENT REASON FOR THE EXEMPTION WE FIND NO REASONABLE GROUND FOR DECLARING THE LAW INVALID 6OTHE SUPREME COURT OF MICHIGAN ON

EMPLOYMENT OF THE PLAINTIFF WAS NOT THE APPROXIMATE CAUSE OF THE INJURY WHATEVER VIEW MAY BE ENTERTAINED UNDER STATUTES DIFFERENTLY WORDED WE THINK IT ENTIRELY CLEAR THAT THE DISREGARD OF THE INHIBITION OF THIS STATUTE BY PLACING THE PLAINTIFF AT WORK AT AN EMPLOYMENT WHERE HIS LIFE OR LIMB WAS ENDANGERED CONSTITUTED THE NEGLIGENCE OR WRONG OF WHICH PLAINTIFF HAS THE RIGHT TO COMPLAIN AND THAT THE CAUSAL CONNECTION BETWEEN THAT WRONG AND THE INJURY TO PLAINTIFF IS CLEAR CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH THIS QUESTION IS THAT OF ASSUMPTION OF RISK THIS QUESTION WE REGARD AS SETTLED I E THAT IN

THEREFORE THAT THE LAW PROHIBITING THE EMPLOYMENT OF A CHILD UNDER SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE FOR LONGER THAN TEN HOURS IN ANY ONE DAY IS A VALID EXERCISE OF LEGISLATIVE POWER IT IS ARGUED HOWEVER THAT THE

J100587,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16831775,102075,AN ACCOUNT OF THE COURSE OF THE TIDES AT TONQUEEN IN A LETTER FROM MR FRANCIS DAVENPORT JULY 15 1678 WITH THE THEORY OF THEM AT THE BARR OF TONQUEEN BY THE LEARNED EDMUND HALLEY FELLOW OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY,I206879,677 AN ACCOUNT OF THE COURSE OF THE TIDES AT TONQUEEN IN A LETTER FROM MR FRANCIS DAVENPORT JULY 15 1678 WITH THE THEORY OF THEM AT THE BARR OF TONQUEEN BY THE LEARNED EDMUND HALLEY FELLOW OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY WHEN THE REPORTED IRREGULARITY OF THE EBBING AND FLOWING OF THE SEA CAME FIRST UNDER MY CONSIDE RATION AT A DISTANCE I WAS CONTENT TO FANCY THAT I HAD GUESSED ARIGHT IN ASCRIBING THE OCCASION OF IT PRINCI PALLY TO THE INDRAUGHTS AND OUTLETS OF THIS BAY WHICH AS I IMAGINED MIGHT GIVE THE DIFFERENT TIMES OF THE YEAR IN RESPECT OF THE MONSOONS AND THE CURRENTS ACCORDINGLY SHIFTING WITH SEVERAL OTHER CONCEITED COADJUTANT CIRCUM STANCES THE MOST CONSIDERABLE SHARE IN THE UNUSUAL COURSE OF THE TIDES AND THAT CONSEQUENTLY IT WOULD SCARSE BE POS SIBLE TO DISCOVER ANY CONSTANCY IN THEM IF THEIR REGI MENT DEPENDED SO MUCH UPON ACCIDENTS AND UNCERTAIN TYS BUT DURING MY CONTINUANCE AT BATSHA I HAVE OBSERV ED SUCH AN ORDER AND CONSTANCY IN THE COURSE OF THE TIDES THAT NOTWITHSTANDING I MUST NEEDS CONFESS IT DIFFERENT FROM ALL THAT EVER I OBSERVD IN ANY OTHER PORTYET NOT ONLY FROM THE COINCIDENTS OF SIMULAR ALTERATIONS ON PECULIAR DAYES OF SOME PARTICULAR MOONES IN DIFFERENT MONSOONS IN RESPECT OF THEIR INCREASE AND DECREASE AS WELL AS FROM THEIR KEEPING EQUAL PACE WITH THE MOONS RISING AND SETT ING IN THIS HORIZON IN RESPECT OF THE DURATION OF THEIR IN FLUX AND REFLUX BUT ALSO FROM THAT WHICH SEEMS TO RENDER THEM MOST IRREGULAR VIZ THE CONSTANT FALLING BACK OF THE FLOOD NEAREST 13 HOURS ON EVERY SECOND DAY OF THE WATERS AGE AND INCREASE SO THAT AT THE END OF 15 DAYES THERE IS AN INVERSION OF THEIR MOTION IN RESPECT OF THEIR BEGINNING TO FLOW AND EBB IT IS EVIDENT THAT THEY ARE REGULARLY INFLUENCED THOUGH NOT RECONCILEABLE WITH A DEPENDANCE ON THE LUNAR MO TION678 TION SO FAR AS WHOLY TO FREE THE NATURAL COURSE FROM THE INTERRUPTION OF SOME FORREIGN INTERVENING CONTROUL MENT NOW FOR AS MUCH AS IT WILL BE SATISFACTORY ENOUGH FOR ANY MANS BENEFIT OF THE TIDES TO KNOW WHEN THE FLOOD AND  BEGINS AND WHEN THERE IS THE GREATEST AND SMALLEST INFLUXES WITHOUT ANY NICE DISCOURSE OF THE CAUSES OF THEIR DIFFERENCE HERE FROM THOSE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD A SUBJECT FITTER FOR PHILOSOPHERS THEN SCAMEN I HAVE HERE TO AVOID OVERMUCH TEDIOUSNESS ENTRED ONLY THE RESULT OF MY UNINTERMITTED OBSERVATIONS OF THE TIDES DAYLY COURSE DURING MY STAY AT BATSHA BY WHICH THOSE COM MANDERS WHO AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR COME BEFORE THIS BARRMAY KNOW WHEN IT WILL BE MOST CONVENIENT TO COME OVER SUPPOSING NO PILATE GOES OFF TO BRING THEM IN IF THEY PLEASE TO OBSERVE THE FOLLOWING DIRECTIONS DIRECTIONS CONCERNING THE CHOICE OF TIME IN RESPECT OF THE TIDES FOR COMING OVER THE BAR MY ADVICE IS THAT UPON THE SEVERAL FOLLOWING DAYES OF THE MOONS AGE IN EVERY PARTICULAR MONTH OF THE YEARE NO ENGLISH COMMANDER SHOULD UPON ANY OCCASION WHATSOEVER ADVENTURE OVER THIS BAR UNLESS HE HAVE A PI LOT FROM THE SHOARE WHO UNDERTAKES TO BRING HIM IN OR THAT HE HATH ONLY CHARGE OF SOME SMALL BARK OR JUNKE THAT DRAWS NO MORE THEN 8 OR 9 FOOT WATER 1 3 7 DAYES OF THE MOONES IN THE  MOONES FROM

HE MAY SAFELY ADVENTURE OVER THE BAR ANY DAY PROVIDED ALLWAYS THAT HE MISTAKE NOT THE TIME OF THE TIDE BUT COME OVER AT HALF FLOOD OR BETTER THOUGH HE MAY TAKE NOTICE THAT THE BEST TIDES WILL BE ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN DAYES AFTER THE WATERS FIRST BEGINING TO INCREASE AND THE FIRST DAYES OF THE WATERS INCREASE ARE 1 5 IN THE  MOONES ON THE  DAYES  7 19  2 3  IN THE  MOONES ON THE 16  DAYES  8 29  3 13

NEEDLESS TO TAKE NOTICE IN WHAT HOURS THE WATERS INCREASE BEGINS BECAUSE THE REGULAR COURSE OF THE TIDES IS NOT FROM THENCE COMMENCED IN RESPECT OF THE TIME OF FLOWING AND EBBING THE BAR IT SELFE BEING ABOUT A MILE AND HALF IN LENGTH AND NO WHERE EXCEPT IN ITS FIRST ENTRANCE EXCEEDING HALF A MILE IN BREADTH IS VERY EVEN BUT YET AFFORDS CONSIDE RABLY DIFFERING SOUNDINGS IN THE SAME AGE AND TIME OF THE TIDESACCORDING TO THE SEASON OF THE YEARAND WHICH SEEMS TO BE SOMEWHAT STRANGEHATH THE HIGHEST TIDES IN THE NOR THERLY MONSOON AS I HAVE BEEN INFORMED BY THOSE WHO ARE SEEMINGLY BEST ABLE TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT THEREOF AND I MUST NEEDS SAY THAT THE TRYAL I NOW MADE ON THE BAR DID ACCORD WITH WHAT I UNDERSTOOD FROM SEVERAL OF THE FISHER MEN AND OTHERS AS TO THIS MONTH WHICH INDUCED ME TO ENTER THIS INFORMATION THAT COMING OVER AT HALF FLOOD EXCEPT ON THE DAYES AFOREMENTIONED AS DANGEROUS TO COME OVER IN THERE WILL BE FOUND ACCORDING TO THE AGE OF THE TIDES 3 IN THE 4 MOONES FROM 16 TO 21 FEET WATER 5 6 IN THE 7 MOONES FROM 19 TO 24 FEET 8 9 IN THE 10 MOONES FROM 21 TO 27 FEET 11 12 IN THE 1 MOONES FROM 14 TO 22 FEET 2 ALWAYS THE HIGHER THE FLOOD THE LOWER THE EHB SO THAT ACCORDING TO THE STRENGTH OF THE TIDES AT LOW WATER THE FOUNDINGS ARE FROM 6 TO 13 FEET NB THIS BAR OF TUNKING IS ABOUT 110 DEGREES OF LON GI UDE TO THE EAST OF LONDON AND IU LATITUDE 20  ON681 ON THE FIRST AND SECOND DAYES OF THE WATERS INCREASE THE INFLUXES ARE VERY SMALL AND UNCERTAIN BUT AFTERWARDS THE TIDES FOR 13 DAYES ARE CONSTANT IN THEIR COURSE ONE FLOOD AND ONE EBB BEING COMPLEATED IN 24 HOURS TIME E QUALLY SHARING THE SPACE OF A LUNAR CIRCUITION OF THE EARTH BETWEEN THEM AND EVERY FLOOD BEGINNING NEAR EST 34 OF AN HOUR LATER THEN THE PRECEDENT FLOOD AND ALSO CON SIDERABLY INCREASING IN THE HEIGHT OF THE TIDE EVERY DAY FROM THE 3D UNTO THE 6TH AND 7TH DAYES OF THE WATERS AGE ON WHICH TWO DAYES THE FLOOD RUNS VERY HIGH BUT ON THE 8TH DAY WHICH MAY BE ACCOUNTED THE LAST OF THE SPRING TIDES THE WATERS BEGIN GRADUALLY TO DECREASE AGAIN RE TAMING THE SAME ORDERLY DIFFERENCE OF TIME IN EACH TIDE UNTILL THE NEXT FOLLOWING FIRST DAY OF THE WATERS INCREASE WHEN DURING TWO DAYES UNSETLEDNESS THERE IS A SHIFTING OF THE TIDES IN RESPECT OF THE BEGINNING OF THE FLOOD AND EBB AFTER WHICH SAID SHIFTING A CONSTANCY IN THEIR INVERTED COURSE IS AGAIN RETAINED IN THE ABOVE MENTIONED ORDER FOR 13 DAYES FOLLOWING AS FOR EXAMPLE ON THE 25 AND 26 DAYES OF THE 4TH MOONE 4TH AND 5TH OF JUNE 1678  IN THE LATTER END OF ARIES BEING THE FIRST DAYES OF THE WATERS INCREASE THE INFLUXES WERE VERY SMALL THERE HAPPENING ON THE 26TH A FALLING BACK OF THE TIDES ABOUT 13 HOURS BUT FROM THE 27TH JUNE 6 78 WHICH WAS THE 3D DAY OF THE WATERS INCREASE AFTER THE LAST QUARTER UNTO THE 9TH DAY OF THE 5TH MOONES AGE JUNE 18 1678  IN  20 I NOTED A VERY CONSTANT COURSE IN THE TIDES EVERY FLOOD BEGINING WITH THE RISING OF THE MOONE AND ENDING AT ITS SETTING THE FOLLOWING EBB IN LIKE MAN NER CONTINUING DURING THE TIME OF THE MOONES ABSENCE FROM THIS HEMISPHERE BUT ON THE SAID 9TH DAY OF THE 5TH MOONES AGE JUNE 18 1678 BEING THE FIRST DAY OF THE WA TERS INCREASE THEIR MOTION WAS SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE ON THE 10TH DAY THERE WAS ANOTHER FALLING BACK OF THE TIDES NEAREST 13 HOURS AND ON THE 11TH DAY WHICH WAS THE 3D DAY OF THE WATERS INCREASE AFTER THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE MOONES AGE THE FLOOD HAVING AS I SAID SHIFTED THE PRE M 2 CEDING682 CEDING DAY TOOK ITS TURNE TO BEGIN AT THE MOONES SETTING AND END AT ITS RISING AND ACCORDINGLY THE TIDES SUCCES SIVELY FOLLOWING ASSUMED  KEPT A CONSTANT REGULARITY THE TIDES BEING AT HIGHEST THE 16TH OF THE MOONE 1678 JUNE 24  IN MIDDLE OF  WHICH WAS THE SEVENTH OF THE WA TERS AGE UNTIL THE 23D OF THE SAID MOONES AGE JULY 1 1678 ON WHICH BEING THE FIRST DAY OF THE WATERS IN CREASE THE INFLUX WAS AGAIN SCARCELY DISCERNABLE FOR ITS SMALLNESS ON THE 24TH DAY THE TIDES FALL BACK AS I HAD FOUND IT TWICE BEFORE TO HAVE DONE ON THE SAME DAYES OF THE WATERS AGE NEAREST 13 HOURS BY WHICH MEANES THE FLOOD ON THE 25TH DAY WHICH WAS THE 3D DAY OF THE WATERS IN CREASE AFTER THE LAST QUARTER OF THE MOONE NOW AGAIN COM MENCED WITH THE RISEING MOONE WHEREBY IT HATH FALLEN OUT ALLWAYES TO BE HIGH WATER BETWEEN NOONE AND THE FOLLOWING MIDNIGHT EVERY DAY DURING MY STAY HERE  LAST QUARTER 22 DAYES  FIRST QUARTER 8 DAYES SO THAT IT MAY PASS INTO A COROLLARY VIZ IN THE 4TH 5TH AND 6TH CHANGES OF THE MOONE FROM THE 3D DAY OF THE WA TERS AGE AFTER THE LAST QUARTER TO THE 3D DAY OF THE WA TERS AGE AFTER THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE FOLLOWING MOONE THE WATER BEGINS TO FLOW WHEN THE MOONE RISETH AND TO EBB AGAIN WHEN IT SETTETH IN THE HORIZON AND THE CONTRARY TO THE 3D DAY OF THEIR AGE AFTER THE LAST QUARTER EXCLUD ING ALL WAYES THEIR MOTION ON THE 2 FIRST DAYES OF THE WA TERS INCREASE BECAUSE OF ITS SMALLNESS AND UNCERTAIN TY I AM INFORMD BY THE INHABITANTS HERE ABOUTS THAT THIS MAY HOLD FOR A RULE FROM THE 2D TO THE END OF THE 7TH MOONE AND THAT THE CONVERSE THEREOF HOLDS TRUE IN THE O THER SIX MONTHS OF THE YEAR VIZ FROM THE 8TH TO THE END OF THE FIRST MOONE ACCORDING TO WHICH THE TIDES WILL FALL OUT TO BE AT THE HIGHEST IN THE EVENING FOR 6 MONTHS SUC CESSIVELY AND THE OTHER HALF YEAR IN THE MORNINGTHAT IS TO SAY BETWEEN MIDNIGHT AND THE FOLLOWING MOONES AND THOUGH I CANNOT AYER THE TRUTH OF IT YET I FIND THAT THE TIDE683 TIDE LAST YEAR IN THE 11TH MOONE WHICH OCCASIONALLY UPON THE SHIP EAGLES DEPARTURE HENCE I TOOK SOME NOTICE OF AND ENTRED IN THE CLOSE OF MY SEA JOURNAL DID FALL OUT NOT DISAGREEING WITH WHAT THEY AFFIRME AND I AM YET THE RATHER INDUCD TO BELIEVE THAT IN EVERY ANNUAL REVOLUTION THERE MAY BE SUCH A CONSTANCY IN THIS DIFFERENT MOTION OF THE TIDE APPROPRIATED TO EACH MOIETY OF THE YEAR BE CAUSE THAT DUREING MY DAYES STAY AT BATSHA I HAVE FOUND THE PREDICTIONS OF THE NATIVES CONFIRMED BY MY OWNE OBSERVATIONS OF THE TIDES FALLING OUT TO BE HIGH WA TER ALWAYES BETWEEN NOONE AND THE SUCCEEDING MIDNIGHT OCCASIONED BY THE AFORESAID FALLING BACK AT THE END OF 15 DAYES SO THAT ON EVERY 3D DAY OF THE WATERS INCREASE THE FLOOD BEGINS AT THE HOUR WHEREON THE DAY BEFORE IT ENDED TO PREVENT MISTAKES IN THE ACCOMPT OF THE MOONES THOUGH THE DIFFERENCE OF MERIDIANS BETWEEN THIS PLACE AND LONDON TOGETHER WITH THE DIFFERENT BEGINNING OF THEIR NA TURAL DAY IN THEIR ACCOMPTS HERE FROM THAT OF OURS AND SOME IMPERFECTIONS FROM WHICH THEIR ASTRONOMICAL OBSER VATIONS ARE NOT FREE MAY OCCASION A DISAGREEMENT BE TWEEN OUR ACCOMPT AND THEIRS OF THE MOONES AGE YET IT WILL NEVER BE SO CONSIDERABLE AS TO OCCASION ANY SENSIBLE AT LEAST DANGEROUS ERROR IN THE ABOVE MENTIONED RECK ONING OF THE TIDES PROVIDED THE NUMBER OF THE MONETH BE NOT MISTAKEN WHEREFORE IT MAY BE SUFFICIENT TO INFORME THOSE WHO USE THIS PORT THAT THE FIRST CHANGE OF THE MOONE AFTER THE 15TH DAY OF JANUARY OLD STILE IS RECKONED FOR THE BEGINING OF THE YEAR AND THAT MOONE BEING ACCOMPTED THE FIRST THE REST FOLLOW IN ORDER UNTIL THE EXPIRATION OF THE 12TH WHICH COMPLEATS THEIR YEAR ALWAYES EXCEPT ONLY IN THEIR LEAP YEARS AND THEN THEY HAVE 13 MOONES TAKEING IN ONE EXTRAORDINARY TO MAKE UP THE DEFICIENCY OF THE MOONES EPACT IN THEIR ACCOMPT IN WHICH YEAR THE FIRST DAY OF THEIR NEW YEARES MOONE FALLS OUT BEFORE THE SAID 15TH OF JANUA RY AS IT DID THIS YEAR UPON THE 12TH BEING LEAP YEARE WITH THEM684 THEM SO THAT THEY RECKONED TWO MONTHS FOR ONE THIS YEARE THAT IS TO SAY THE 2D AND 3D MOONES AFTER THEIR NEWYEARS DAY THEY CALLED 2D MOONES FOR OTHERWAYES THIS PRESENT MOONE WHICH CHANGED IN JULY THE 8TH WOULD HAVE BEEN THE 7TH WHEREAS NOW THEY COUNT IT BUT THE 6TH MOONE AND ACCORDINGLY DO THE TIDES FALL OUT BUT THIS LEAP YEARE BEING NOW PAST THE FIRST MOONE IN THE YEARE MUST BE RECKONED TO BEGIN ON THE CHANGE NEXT FOLLOWING THE 15TH OF JANUARY AND ALL THE OTHER CHANGES COUNTED SUCCESSIVE LY AS BEFORE SAID UNTIL THE INTERVENTION OF ANOTHER LEAP YEARE OBSERVATIONS685 A THEORY OF THE TIDES AT THE BAR OF TUNKING BY THE LEARNED MR EDM HALLEY FELLOW OF THE ROYAL SO CIETY THE EFFECT OF THE MOON UPON THE WATERS IN THE PRODU CTION OF THE TIDES IN THIS PORT OF TUNKING IS THE MORE WONDERFUL AND SURPRIZING IN THAT IT SEEMES DIFFERENT IN ALL ITS CIRCUMSTANCES FROM THE GENERAL RULE WHEREBY THE MOTI ON OF THE SEA IS REGULATED IN ALL OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD I HAVE YET HEARD OF FOR FIRST EACH FLUX IS OF ABOUT 12 HOURS DURATION AND ITS CORRESPONDENT REFLUX AS LONG SO THAT THERE IS BUT ONE HIGH WATER IN 24 HOURS THEN THERE ARE IN EACH MONTH TWO INTERMISSIONS OF THE TIDES ABOUT 14 DAYES ASUNDER WHEN THERE IS NO SENSIBLE FLOOD OR RISING OF THE WATERS TO BE OBSERVED BUT THE SEA IS IN A MANNER STAGNANT THIRDLY THAT THE INCREASE OF THE WATER HAS ITS 14 DAYS PERIOD BETWEEN THE AFORESAID INTERMISSIONS AND AT 7 DAYS END MAKES THE HIGHEST TIDES FROM WHICH TIME THE WATER AGAIN GRADUALLY ABATES AND THE FLOOD IS WEAKER TILL IT COMES TO A STAGNATION BOTH INCREASE AND DECREASE OBSERVING THE SAME RULE IN BEING EXCEEDING SLOW IN THEIR BEGINING AND END AND SWIFT IN THE MIDDLE LASTLY AND WHICH IS MOST ODD THE RISING MOON IN THE ONE HALF OF EACH MONTH MAKES HIGH WATER AND THE SETTING MOONE IN THE OTHER HALF THESE PARTICULARS CONSIDERED TO GETHER WITH THE TABLES SHEWING THE DAYS OF THE WATERS STAGNATION IN EACH MONETH GAVE ME A LIGHT INTO THE SECRET OF THIS STRANGE APPEARANCE SO AS TO BE ABLE TO BRING THE HITHERTO UNACCOUNTABLE IRREGULARITY OF THESE TIDES TO A CERTAIN RULE AND FIRST IT APPEARS BY THE LATTER OF THE TWO TABLES THAT THE INTERMISSIONS OF THE TIDES HAP PEN NEARLY UPON THOSE DAYS THAT THE MOON ENTERS THE SIGNS OF ARIES AND LIBRA OR PASSES THE EQUINOCTIAL WHICH DIVIDES THE MOONS COURSE NEARLY INTO TWO EQUAL PARTS AS WELL AS THE SUNS AND FROM HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT THE TRO PICAL686 PICAL MOONES IN  AND  ARE THESE WHICH OCCASION THE GREATEST FLUX AND REFLUX AND FOR THE RULE OF THE CHANGE OF THE TIME OF HIGH WATER WHICH MR DAVENPORT CALLS A FALL ING BACK OF THE TIDES THE EXAMPLE HE HATH GIVEN US LETS US KNOW THAT THE  IN NORTHERN SIGNS BRINGS IN THE FLOOD WHILST SHE IS ABOVE THE HORIZON SO AS TO MAKE HIGH WATER AT HER SETTING AND ON THE CONTRARY THAT WHILST SHEE IS IN SOU THERN SIGNS IT FLOWS ALL THE TIME THE MOON IS BELOW THE HO RIZON AND SO MAKE HIGH WATER AT HER RISING BUT IT IS TO BE OBSERVED THAT THOUGH THE MOON PASS SWIFTLY FROM SOUTH TO NORTH WHEN SHE IS IN OR NEAR  AND FROM NORTH TO SOUTH WHEN IN OR NEAR LIBRA YET THE MOTION OF THE SE A WHICH IS THE CAUSE OF THIS TIDE IS SCARCE DISCERNABLE FOR 3 OR 4 DAYS WHEN THE MOON PASSES THE SAID EQUINOCTIAL POINTS WHENCE IT APPEARS THAT THOUGH THE DECLINATION OF  OR HER DISTANCE FROM THE EQUINOCTIAL BE THAT WHEREBY THESE TIDES ARE REGULATED YET THE INCREASE AND DECREASE OF THE WATER IS BY NO MEANES PROPORTIONATE TO THAT OF THE DECLINATION OF LUNA THAT CHANGING SWIFTLY WHERE THE IN CREASE OF THE WATER IS OBSERVED TO BE MOST SLOW IT SEEMS THEREFORE AND I PROPOSE IT AS A PROBABLE CONJECTURE THAT THE INCREASE OF THE WATERS SHOULD BE ALLWAYS PROPORTIONATE TO THE VERSEDSIGNES OF THE DOUBLED DISTANCES OF THE MOON FROM THE EQUINOCTIAL POINTS UPON WHICH HYPOTHESIS FI GURE 9 WILL GIVE AN ELEGANT SYNOPSIS OF THE WHOLE MATTER LET AB BE THE BOTTOM OF THE BAR OF TUNKING CD A PER PENDICULAR THERETO WHEREON TO MEASURE THE SEVERAL DEPTHS OF THE WATER C C THE MEAN DEPTH WHICH IS THAT WHEREAT THE WATER IS STAGNANT UPON THE MOONS BEING UPON THE EQUINOCTIAL POINTS BEING COMMONLY ABOUT 15 FEET C  OCCID THE HIGH WATER MARK WHEN THE MOON IS IN  OR  BEING ABOUT 24 FOOT C OCCID THE HIGHT OF THE LOW WATER MARK WHEN THE MOON IS IN  OR  BEING ABOUT 6 FOOT SO THAT THE GREATEST RISE OF THE WATER ON THE TROPI CAL MOONS WILL BE ABOUT 18 FOOT THEN DIVIDING   AND   INTO TWO EQUAL PARTS IN EF ON THOSE TWO POINTS AS CENTERS DESCRIBE THE 2 CIRCLES EACH OF WHOSE RADII ARE FOUR687 FOUR FEET AND A HALF WHICH BEING KEPT BETWEEN THE COM PASSES NATURALLY DIVIDE THE SAID CIRCLES IN THE POINTS  C THROUGH THE WHICH POINTS IF YOU DRAW LINES PARALLEL TO THE BASE A B THEY SHALL CUT THE PERPENDICULAR C D IN THE HIGHTS OF THE HIGH AND LOW WATER MARKS WHICH WILL BE AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE MOON INTO THE SAID SIGNS SO THE GREATEST DEPTH OF THE HIGH WATER WHEN THE MOON ENTERS     IS BUT 17  FEET AND THE LEAST AT LOW WATER 12 FEET BUT WHEN SHE ENTERS  THE HIGHWATER DEPTH IS 21  FEET THE LOWWATER BUT 8  FEET AS APPEARS BY THE FI GURE AND THIS HYPOTHESIS NOT ONLY AGREES WITH ALL THAT MR DAVENPORT HATH OBSERVED HIMSELF OR COLLECTED FROM THE NATIVES BUT HATH BEEN FOUND TO HOLD TRUE SINCE IN THE YEAR 1682 BY THE INGENIOUS CAPT KNOX IN HIS VOIAGE TO THIS PORT SO THAT THERE IS NO ROOM TO DOUBT OF THE TRUTH THEREOFBY THIS METHOD MAY THE TIME AND HIGHT OF THE TIDES BE WITH SUFFICIENT CERTAINTY COMPUTED BUT TO PHILOSOPHIZE THERON AND TO ATTEMPT TO ASSIGN A REASON WHY THE MOON SHOULD IN SO PARTICULAR A MANNER INFLUENCE THE WATERS IN THIS ONE PLACE IS A TASK TOO HARD FOR MY UNDERTAKING ESPECIALLY WHEN I CONSIDER HOW LITTLE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ESTABLISH A GENUINE AND SATISFACTORY THEORY OF THE TIDES FOUND UPON OUR OWN COASTS OF WHICH WEE HAVE HAD SO LONG EXPERIENCE IT WOULD BE HOWEVER A VERY ACCEPTABLE THING IF SOME CURIOUS NAVIGATORS WOULD INFORM US WHAT TIDES OR CURRENTS ARE FOUND AT MACAO QUEMOY AND OTHER PLACES ON THE COAST OF CHINA AND ON FORMOSA IT BEING MOST PROBABLE THAT THIS FLOOD COMETH OUT OF THE NORTH EAST A LONGST THE COAST OF CHINA FOR THAT THE NORTHERLY MOONSOON IS FOUND TO OCCASION THE HIGHEST SPRINGTIDES THERE IS YET ANOTHER THING WELL WORTH INQUIRY THAT SEEING THAT THIS MOTION OF THE SEA IS MORE OR LESS AS THE MOON IS FAR THER FROM OR NEARER TO THE EQUINOCTIALL IT IS NOT UNLIKELY THAT SOME YEARS MAY HAVE MUCH HIGHER SPRINGTIDES THAN OTHERS ACCORDING TO THE VARIOUS OBLIQUITY OF THE MOONS ORBITE TO THE EQUINOCTIALL FOR WHEN THE ASCENDING NODE IS IN  AS IT WAS ANNO 1671 AND WILL BE ANNO 1690 N THE688 THE MOON IN  AND  DEVIATES FROM THE EQUATOR FUL 28 DEGREES AND BUT 18 DEGREES WHEN THE SAME NODE IS IN LIBRA AS IT WAS ANNO 1680 AND I RECOMMEND AS A VERY USEFULL QUAERIE FOR SUCH AS FOR THE FUTURE SHALL USE THIS PORT TO EXAMINE WHETHER THE TIDES ARE NOT IN SOME YEARS MORE VIGOROUS THAN IN OTHERS AND PARTICULARLY IN THE YEARS BUT NOW MENTIONED AS LIKEWISE IF THERE HAVE BEEN ANY INUNDATIONS OCCASIONED BY AN EXTRAORDINARY FLUX OF THE SEA IN WHAT YEARS THE SAID INUNDATIONS HAVE HAP PENED DEFECTUS

HEBREW AND TO ARAMAIC BY Misnaic Hebrew MH we understand the idiom in which was composed the Halakic and Haggadic literature of the Jews from c 200 BC to 200 A C i e from Simon the Just down to the first generation of the Amoraim This literature comprises first and foremost the Miszna edited in its present form c 150 A C and its companions the Tosefta A both dR Nathan and the Masektoth Ketanoth the Midragim Melilta Sifra Sifre and Seder Olan further the Hebrew portions of the Gemaroth and of the exclusively Haggadic Midrasim and a number of minor works which though very late in their present forms contain nevertheless elements which go back to the Misnaic period The term Mi9na mnt used in this connexion must be understood in that wider sense which includes all the earlier Rabbinic literature as distinguished from the Scriptures KpD 1 This name Mignaic Hebrew is prefer able to the term New Hebrew NVeuhebrdisch by which the idiom is commonly known It has the merit of being free from any ambiguity The latter is appropriate enough in relation to Biblical Hebrew BH but it either ignores 1 Cf Bacher Terminotogie p 34 and n 2 pp I22 f I94 VOL XX X x648 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW the later phases through which after the Talmudic period the Hebrew language passed or confuses them 1 with that particular stage of its development with which we are now concerned Paitanic Hebrew 2 mediaeval Hebrew of the Hispano Arabic school and Modern HIebraw beginning with R Moses Haim Luzzatto I7o503 may have little or no value to the philological student as such 4 but they are certainly not without their linguistic interest In any case the existence of these idioms is a fact To ignore them in studying the history of the Hebrew language would be unscientific It is therefore important that every one of the varied idioms of the language at whatever period it appeared should be distinguished by an appropriate and precise designation The grammatical treatment of MH has been scanty and fragmentary The first pioneer work was Geigers little Lehrbuch which in spite of many serious defects still remains the best work on the subject Unfortunately it does not go far enough Leopold Dukes book Die Sprache der Mischna Esslingen 1846 is of little value Far better is Weisss learned and suggestive work inewn lsv lown Vienna i867 But Weiss eminent though he was as a Talmudist was not a trained philologist or grammarian and hence his judgment was not always what it should be especially where he applied Rabbinical dialectics to the elucidation of questions of etymology The arrangement of the work and its technical language is also crude and primitive More methodical and fuller in the grammatical side is Siegfried and Stracks NH Grammatik But their work is vitiated by the admission of many Talmudic and even mediaeval forms by the failure of the authors to distinguish between MH and Aramaic or semiAramaic I As is done by Siegfried and Strack in their Grammatik 2 Cf Zunz

forms and phrases and by a number of other inaccuracies Useful material has also been collected by S Stein in his dissertation Das Verbum in der Mischnasprache Berlin i888 and by F Hillel in Nominalbildung in der Mischna Berlin I89I Scattered notices of MH forms are also found in Barths Nominalbildung On the lexical side too much still remains to be done The elucidation and derivation of words have indeed been performed worthily and with adequacy in the wellknown lexicons notable among which are Kohuts prolix but monumental edition of R Nathans Aruch Jacob Levys great and useful NH Worterbuch and the more recent Dictionary by Marcus Jastrow the only work on the subject in the English language But no systematic attempt has yet been made to distinguish the Hebraic elements in the vocabulary of MH from the Aramaic and to trace their history and development both in form and meaning As to the nature of MH and its connexion with BH on the one side and with Aramaic on the other great diversity of opinion prevails among scholars Geiger2 regards it as a purely artificial and mechanical creation of the Schoolmen comparing it to the Latin of the Middle Ages He goes so far as to trace some of its forms to false exegesis 3 Siegfried and Strack hold the same view p 5 though they frequently point out the connexion of MH forms with the corresponding forms in BH Lector M Friedmann holds that MH is nothing but a Hebraized 1 The services of this scholar to Semitic philology have not yet received the recognition which they richly deserve For though many of his etymologies may be fanciful and farfetched he has nevertheless succeeded in restoring to the Semitic vocabulary a large number of words hitherto held to be of foreign derivation and in the case of many others in at least reopening the question of their etymology for further discussion 2 So already Salomon Levysohn in his introductory essay pn i bv sr2n nrtn jt5 printed in the Warsaw edition of the Misna 1879 3 Cf his explanation of  S of Mntw of mn p 24 X X650 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Aramaic According to his theory MH was so to say manufactured by the Rabbis after the fall of Bar Kokba who for national and religious reasons had become hostile to Aramaic now completely christianized and in order to spread this newfangled dialect among the people they had composed 1 in it Midrasic commentaries on the Bible tales legends c thus creating the Rabbinic literature through which MH gained currency among the mass of Jews Onkelos und Akylas Wien I896 p 86 ff To this G Dalman agrees at least as far as the character of the idiom is concerned Gram d JidPal Aramn 2nd ed Leipzig I905 p io  6 Geigers view is stoutly contested by Graetz Litteratur blatt d Orients 1844 col 824 ff He asserts that MH was a living language spoken by the Jews in Hasmonean times and that it was moreover the natural and direct development of BH This practically is also the opinion of S D Luzzato ibid I846 col 830 ff and of Jacob Levy who regards MH as a popular and corrupted form of BH ibid I844 col 8I1 2 The genuine character of MH has been defended more recently by 1M Israel Ldvi who adduces the wealth of MH words and expressions connected with secular occupations and with matters of general daily life as evidence of its having been the ordinary language of everyday life Ecclgsiastique Introd p xxii So also M Griinbaum Z D M G XXXIX p 592 f and Sern Studies in lMemoory of Kohut p 232 f Dr Wijnkoop J Q R XV p 23 ff and Prof W Bacher in his article Hebrew Language in the Jewish Encyclopaedia Noldeke seems to occupy an intermediate position He holds that MH was a genuine survival of classical Hebrew which however was preserved only artificially by the schoolmen whose ordinary and natural language was Aramaic 1 c and Die Semitischen Sprachen 2nd ed t To be precise one would have to add and translated as a great part of this literature originated much earlier than that age 2 Cf also Maimonides to Terurnoth I IMISNAIC HEBREW BIBLICAL HEBREW AND ARAMAIC 651 p 2I f He is followed by Brockelmann in his new Comparative Gramnar p 9 f On the other hand Weiss p 2 grants that MH was used as a medium of speech by the ordinary people but nevertheless treats it almost throughout his book as an artificial scholastic idiom In order to facilitate its solution it will be useful to state the problem more fully and to indicate the real questions at issue On perusing any ordinary chapter of the Misna the reader is at once struck by many peculiarities in vocabulary grammar style and diction He will meet with a large number of words which are unknown in BH but common in Aramaic Again a number of words which occur both in BH and in Aram but are used in the latter in a different sense will be found in MH in the Aram sense Many genuine BH words are used in MH in an entirely new connotation The reader will also meet with a large number of technical words and phrases which are quite unknown in BH Then as to grammar he will find forms which in BE occur but sporadically and are there fore termed by grammarians irregular constituting in MH the usual and normal type and again forms and constructions which are entirely novel and without parallel in BH but are common in Aramaic The diction will appear as unlike ordinary Hebrew style as can be Many familiar idioms and constructions without which good Hebrew prose is inconceivable are here entirely absent while at every step the reader stumbles upon usages phrases and turns of speech which strike him as strange and almost barbarous And yet he feels all the time that he is reading Hebrew and not Aramaic that though the in fluence of the latter is perceptible at every step it is yet not the predominant factor but is on the contrary every where subjected to the Hebrew and made to accommodate itself to it and to subserve it Now is this idiom a genuine and natural Hebrew speech only coloured and disfigured by Aram influence or is it652 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW merely a mechanical and artificial mongrel production of Hebrew and Aram combined in which Aram though the natural and lifegiving element has been forcibly and mechanically subordinated to the artificial and lifeless Hebrew element Would Hebrew if left alone have developed grammatically and syntactically on much the same lines as our MH shows and has the overpowering influence of Aram merely intensified and hastened that development and in some cases directed it into certain channels or would the development of Hebrew if un checked never have been capable of proceeding on such lines as to produce something similar to MH the latter therefore not being a genuine product of BH but an artificial creation consisting of a clumsy intermixture of dead Hebrew with the living Aram and which is neither the one nor the other It is evident that these questions cannot be settled satisfactorily and scientifically except by a thoroughgoing study of the grammatical phenomena presented by MH and by a comparison of these phenomena with the corresponding forms and constructions in BH especially those of a later period and also with those of Semitic languages other than Aramaic It is only by such a method that we can ascertain whether the linguistic phenomena of MH are natural to it or merely artificial whether such peculiarities which it shares with Aram are its own or merely borrowed from its more powerful rival For the dissimilarity in style however striking between MH and BH cannot be adduced as evidence against the genuine Hebraic character of the Misnaic idiom any more than a similar dissimilarity existing between Old English for example and Modern English can be adduced against the claim of the latter to be the direct lineal descendant of the former especially if we consider the profound and farreaching differences in the surroundings and historical circumstances of the Jews of the Misnaic period and those of Biblical times Some part of this dissimilarity must also be ascribed to the generalMISNAIC HEBREW BIBLICAL HEBREW AND ARAMAIC 653 differences in the character of the subjects treated of in the Bible and in the Misna respectively Nor should too much importance be attached to the differences in vocabulary between MH and BH Words too are subject to the inexorable laws which govern the existence of all organic beings They too become old often prematurely and die without leaving any issue They too are compelled to carry on an incessant struggle for existence in which the weaker go to the wall and often disappear entirely without leaving any trace behind them Moreover new circum stances produce new needs and new ideas and to express them new words and new phrases have to be created or borrowed And owing to these causes a more or less rapid change of vocabulary goes on continually in every living language Such changes have taken place within BH itself and would have gone on on a more extensive scale in postBiblical times even without the dominating influence of Aramaic But while individual words and phrases can be freely laid aside borrowed or exchanged grammatical forms and rules are not so easily and so freely manipulated True they too are subject to change but the change must be natural gradual and imperceptible For grammar is as it were the soul of the language and by violently surrendering its grammar the language would at the same time be giving up its very life and committing its own self destruction Change in grammar is usually a very slow and laborious process The germ of the new form must have existed in the language long before the new form made its appearance And when it does appear it remains for a time quiet and unobtrusive and slowly and gradually works its way until it acquires a permanent place in the government of the language existing for a long time side by side with the old form which it is eventually to supplant And when the latter is compelled at last to acknowledge itself conquered it does not yet yield up its position entirely but continues to exercise some kind of power654 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW however feeble and subordinate until it is finally exter minated by its rival and disappears entirely It follows therefore that if MH be a direct development of BH its grammar will be found to coincide in its general characteristics with the grammar of the latter while in certain particulars it will exhibit changes which it will be possible to some extent at least to trace to their BH sources and to explain their growth by the general laws which regulate the development of Semitic grammar as exemplified in other Semitic dialects The new forms will often agree with Aram but this agreement will have to be capable of being accounted for partly by the close kinship which has ever existed between Hebrew and Aramaic and which would lead to the same results being produced in the two languages under equal conditions partly by the direct influence which a powerful and widely diffused language such as Aram was in the Misnaic period would naturally exercise upon a less powerful though living and independent neighbouring dialect On the other hand if MH is but an artificial creation of men who spoke Aram as their natural language its grammar would be bound to assume one of the following three forms either it would be a painfully exact and pedantic copy of BH or entirely an imitation of Aram grammar or finally a more or less skilful but mechanical and unnatural blending of the grammars of BH and Aram forming a sort of hotchpotch incapable of lending itself to rational explanation or to philological analysis In the following pages an attempt will be made to survey the leading characteristics of the grammar of MH and to compare them wherever possible with the corre sponding forms in BH in Aram and in other Semitic dialects in order to ascertain the true nature of the dialect as revealed in its grammar and its relation to BH and to AramaicMISNAIC HEBREW BIBLICAL HEBREW AND ARAMAIC 655 THE PRONOUN i Personal Pronoun The first person singular is in the Misna and in other purely MH works always K and not z The latter is only found either in quotations from the Bible or in direct allusion to Biblical passages This exclusive use of NK MH shares with later BH Thus 44 never occurs in the popular Song of Songs in Lamentations in Haggai in Zachariah iviii in the semi colloquial memoirs of Ezra in Esther or in Koheleth and only once in each of the following books Ezekiel xxxvi 28 in a common and stereotyped phrase cf Jer xi 4 xxx 22 c Nehemiah i 6 in a prayer Daniel x 1I in the words of the angel and Chronicles i Chron xvii i from 2 Sam vii 2 Elsewhere the chronicler regularly substitutes tS for K

distinct preference for s but P uses sm almost exclusively 1 So also Aramaic with the exception of the Zinjirli dialect 2 Arabic and Ethiopic possess forms corresponding to s only while Assyrian Moabitish and Phoenician use forms corresponding to  only In earlier Hebrew alone the two forms are found existing side by side but t being the shorter of the two gradually came to be employed more frequently especially in colloquial speech until the longer form disappeared entirely from common use The plural is everywhere I 3 This form occurs as is well known only once in BH and then only in

it  but was struck out by the Massorah as a vulgarism All other Semitic languages have forms corresponding to Imm So especially the Aram dialects nm wm pnK and in the latest and most debased dialects

considered as evidence of a genuine modification of the established rule tis must be regarded in such cases as having been borrowed directly from the Aramaic The occurrence of t for the masc in BH Num xi 15 Deut v 24 Ezek xxviii 14 is most probably due to a scribal oversight3 Im the plural rKr is sometimes found for one and in for Dn but this is merely a phonetic change which is very common in MH

THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW documents proves as Schr6der remarks that its use must have been common in the vernacular speech of N Palestine under the influence to some extent at least of the Phoenician tw v the Assyrian a and perhaps also the Aram t T The scarcity of its occurrence even in these documents proves that it was regarded as a vulgarism which the literary language had to avoid Its use gradually extended to S Palestine and being the shorter and more pliable form it must in the course of time have entirely supplanted the longer form in the common language of the people and from this it descended directly into MH But the literary prejudice against it seems to have remained very strong even long after BH had ceased to be a living speech This prejudice accounts for the nonoccurrence of w in Esther its scarcity in the Chronicles and the anxiety to avoid it displayed occasionally even by a man of such an independent mind as the author of Koheleth2 not to mention such

nouns to which they refer are omitted This omission is due to the laconic brevity and the parsimony in words which is one of the characteristics of Rabbinic diction especially in the Halaka The

is found with the article while the substantive is without the article but in almost all these cases the attribute is more or less emphatic limiting the range of the substantive or contrasting it with another substantive of a different character and the article is thus often equivalent to introducing a qualifying relative clause As is well known this construction is already found in a comparatively large number of Biblical passages2 and in some of them a certain emphasis is to be observed in the attribute  but many more are hardly reducible to any rule4 and may therefore be regarded as colloquial irregularities which crept into the literary language All the examples however in the Misna with hardly any exception can be explained on the score of emphasis The following classification

pronoun we are in a position to affirm that as regards the pronoun MH stands wholly on the basis of BH and that the few differences in forms and syntax between the two dialects are natural developments in MIH out of the older BH developments moreover which bear the stamp of a popular and almost colloquial character cf e g U1 1K rn  rn nrT c The develop ment and growth of the MH pronoun have been seen to have proceeded gradually and uninterruptedly along the lines laid down by BH and to have been hardly ever disturbed by Aramaic influence THE VERB The MH verb as is but natural differs materially from the verb in classical Hebrew both in form and usage Some old formations have almost disappeared e g the Pual and the Poel in verbs ly while many forms which appear in BH as late and irregular neologisms have become here the normal type e g the Nithpael the new intensive forms of verbs 1I A great many syntactical idioms which imparted such beauty and force to classical Hebrew style are here entirely absent eg the consecutive tenses the variety of constructions with the infinitive while on the other hand new construetions have arisen which were rare or unknown in BH e g the rise of a present tense in the participle its use with nTnh the periphrasis of the future by ITny Nevertheless in spite of its great gains and still greater losses the MH verb such as it is is entirely indigenous and Hebraic The Aram influence which appears here and there especially in the syntax is not 1 The frequent omission of the article in Sirach is probably to be ascribed to a studied imitation of the poetical and elevated style of BH cf GesK  126 hMISNAIC HEBREW BIBLICAL IEBREW AND ARAMAIC 671 so intense or so general as might be supposed Frequently this influence had already been active in Biblical times and sometimes a formr or usage which appears at first as an Aramaism will be found on closer examination to be a feature common to many or all Semitic dialects in a later stage of their development Such changes and differences manifested by MH cannot therefore be ascribed as they have been hitherto to Aramaic influence but must be explained as productions of the laws of growth and decay which govern all living languages in general and the Semitic family in particular We proceed to review the more prominent etymological and syntactical modifications exhibited by

con tinually changing personal preformatives and especially the perfect which had no preformatives at all were no longer able to maintain themselves This decaying ten dency was already strong in BH where the old passive of the Kal disappeared entirely leaving behind only a few traces and its place was taken by the reflexive Niphal  The same tendency was at work in all the other Semitic languages In Assyrian 2 the reflexive stems were gradually supplanting the passives In Ethiopic 3 in Modern Arabic 4 and of course in Aramaic5 all the passive forms have entirely disappeared and their place has been taken by the corresponding reflexives MH therefore presents in the disappearance of the Pual a common Semitic phenomenon which however it confines to one stem only while the other languages

reflexive of the intensive stem in MH is with few exceptions Nithpael instead of the BH Hithpael Now these two formations are prac tically identical both in form and meaning except that in the perfect the one has n as its preformative and the other  There can therefore be no doubt whatever that the two form really one and the same stem 1 The pre formative 1 was in the course of time changed in popular speech into  on the analogy of the Niphal through  becoming associated in the popular mind with the causative idea through the influence of Hiphil and Hophal and  with the reflexive idea through the influence of the Niphal This change only extended to the perfect for in the imperf there was no room for either of these preformatives and in the infinitive and imperative the Niphal itself has 1 hence also the HithpaelNithpael has retained  eg iann5 Aboth IV 5 npnnr V 17 3nDn III I c In the participle the preformative has maintained itself in spite of the Niphal participle P through its firmly established nominal force which is so universal in Semitic speech Besides it would be unreasonable to expect that an analogy formation of this kind should be worked out to its full logical extreme This change of preformative must have begun at an early period in the popular idiom hence its occurrence already in Deut xxi 9 and later in Ezek xxiii 48 where it is to be noted it has a passive signification Gradually it made its way until in the Minua the old form was almost entirely suppressed The preformative  survives only in the old Misna Bikk III 62 rrlnninr perhaps only 1

perfect sometimes ends in in for nn eg tn Middoth II i but nnvw in Aboth II 3 This is usually ascribed to Aram influence 3 But may not this modification be due simply to the natural phonetic change of n into i How liable older Hebrew was to make this change and how anxious it was to avoid it is shown by the fact that the tone was always placed on the syllables nl tn b3 3 c in order presumably to ensure the distinct pronunciation of the final consonants and to prevent their being confused with each other Naturally this confusion which appears in MH was facilitated and accelerated by contact with Aram but it is difficult to believe that Aram influence alone would have produced this change of letters if Hebrew itself had not shown a natural tendency in that direction Aram influence was incapable of remodelling in the least the 1 An Assyrian word NMld op cit  i8I 8 2 Cf however Jastrow s vv 3 So Stein p 24MISNAIC HIEBREW BIBLICAL HEBREW AND ARAMAIC 68I inflexion of the Hebrew verb

have worked in an opposite direction Instead of producing in MIH one form for both genders it ought to have preserved and accentuated in MH the differences and distinction between the genders and persons of which Aramaic itself is so jealous while Hebrew had always been slack about them as is shown by the common gender of ip Aram lnp m stDp rDp f and the use of mzrp for the second and third fem plural Aram tnpn Sip or iup respectively In the imperfect the form ntpn has entirely disappeared without leaving any trace in the whole of the vast MH literature IDp and rzpn are therefore used

ascribed to the influence of Biblical style which manifested itself only in elevated and semipoetical passages They are not deliberate imitations of the old literary style nor are they derived from the living speech of the day for in either case they would have occurred more frequently As is well known numerous passages are found even in the oldest portions of the Bible in which the simple tenses are used in place of the usual consecutive tenses and this becomes more frequent from the times of Jeremiah onward until in Koheleth the relation between the consecutive and 1 In Megillah III 3 the ordinary reading wn NS is correct it5n could hardly be used in an impersonal sense against Stein 1 c 2 The only passage known to the writer where the consec tenses are found is the remarkable Baraitha in Talm b Kiddus 66 a in which the impf consec occurs seven times three of which are the form Ins1i beside eleven times of the perf with weak waw This Baraitha seems to be a fragment of a collection of historical tales written in MH but affecting to imitate the old historical style 3 Cf Berak I 4 The phrase in the Geulla Dmu Dn 1 Singer p 43 is of course a quotation from Ps cvi IiMISNAIC HEBREW BIBLICAL HEBREW AND ARAMAIC 683 the simple tenses is reversed i e the use of the simple tense becomes regular while that of the consecutive tense becomes exceptional The explanation of this phenomenon as due to Aramaic influence though obvious and plausible is inapplicable to the cases in the earlier books cf Drivers Tenses  I33 It remains therefore to say that this irregularity arose at an early time within the Hebrew language itself and independently of outside influence For it is inconceivable that in ordinary colloquial Hebrew even of the golden age of the language such a subtle and complicated idiom as the use of the consecutive tenses could have always been observed with the strict precision which we generally find in the literary dialect The popular speaker could not always have been equal to the mental strain involved in the regular and continuous use of a construction of this nature Now and again looseness of thought would manifest itself in loose and irregular constructions and these would in due time find their way into the literature and what was first a vulgarism would in the course of time become merely a permissible and innocent irregularity of style and later a regular alter native construction until finally it would become the acceptedly natural and regular mode of expression It may even be doubted whether the consecutive con struction ever attained in popular speech that dominating position which it occupies in the literary dialect and whether the more original and more convenient construc tion with the simple tenses did not survive in the every day language side by side with the new and more elegant construction by means of the consecutive tenses In Phoenician which also possesses the consecutive tenses the simple tenses are used very often where BH would employ the consecutive thus 5   Vn W Cooke N Senm Inscr No 3 1 8 i  r1 K nSVm No 29 I 13 ps  l No 33 1 3 rl 1 No 38 1 i and the common phrase KoD nr No 13 1 2 c both verbs of which are perfects684 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW The contact with Aram would naturally but strengthen the position of the older construction until finally the consecutive tenses would be entirely banished from the living language and survive only in literature largely by force of the literary tradition as in Koheleth Daniel c or through conscious and deliberate imitation of older models so in Esther Chronicles and in Sirach If this be the case the consecutive tenses must have become obsolete in the living language long before the close of the Canon 3 THE INFINITIVE Of the various and manifold constructions with the infinitive to be found in BH MH has only retained the gerundial use with  to express the motion direction and purpose of a verb In its nominal capacity the infin has been supplanted in MH by the corresponding verbal nouns which are so numerous in MH while for the infin with the prepositions   periphrasis with 3 BH sP Aram 1 Dan vi Io C has been substituted as in Syriac and usually in Aramaic The loss of these constructions cannot be ascribed to Aram influence since in Aram the infinitival construction is to be found pretty often at least in the Targumim e g snr Gen xlviii 7 vlp1 xii 4 inr  xxiv 6I spa Exod ix 29 ntnrl xi i c c These Aram forms may of course be due to the influence of the Hebrew text but the fact remains that they were permissible in Aram and not in MH Moreover the infin absolute for emphasizing a following finite verb is extremely common not only in the Targumim but also in Syriacl while not a trace of it is to be found in MH The loss of the infinitive must therefore be due to natural decay And in fact in those late books of the Bible which have not been influenced consciously or unconsciously by Cf Noldeke Syr Gr  293 ff In the Targumim the inf absol is used almost always where the Hebrew text has is Cf also Winers Chald Gr3 I882  46 4 5MISNAIC HEBREW BIBLICAL HEBREW AND ARAMAIC 685 earlier models the use

have certainly used the infinitive This construction of the infin with  or  is also absent in the first chapter of Daniel while from the clumsy way in which it is employed in the rest of this book and also in the original passages of the chronicles  it is evident that it was with these authors an artificial mode of expression in the use and application of which they were but seldom successful Its total disappearance therefore in MH is but natural and inevitable As regards the form of the infin with i it may be remarked that in the Nipllal the preformative n is usually elided after the i as yZW

PARTICIPLE In its form the MH participle coincides exactly with the BI participle The feminine singular usually ends in n n as nlMD nnn nyz So also in BH the fer partic with n is by far the more common form Thus in a cursory examination of the first twentyseven chapters of Genesis the writer has found fifteen examples of the form with n against hardly one with l xx 3 Sv n3 1 The fern of tp however and of verbs lrg and n always ends in n Here we see again how little MH grammar was influenced by Aramaic The analogy of Aram which forms the fern partic by attaching the termination s I  to the masculine ought to have favoured the pre dominance in MH of the form with n1 but as a matter of fact the reverse is the case Curiously enough the scarcity in MH of the fern partic with  has also been attributed to Aram influence Stein p 28 2 Already in BH we find a few cases where the passive ilDp is used for the active viz in intransitive verbs to express an inherent quality as nD n71 2 and

an act in the past or in the future or its continuity through a longer or shorter period the combination thus taking the place of the frequentative and iterative uses of the old perfect con secutive and of the simple tenses The construction in MAH is however of native origin and not borrowed from the Aramaic Already in BH the parltic is construed with the substantive verb2 not only when used in a quasinominal capacity e g Gen iv 2 Deut ix 7 Isa iii 7 in the imperative Ps x I4 and especially with passive participles which are treated almost like adjectives i Kings x 9 Deut xxviii 33 34 Isa ii 2 Zeph ii 4 but also when the partic has a purely verbal force eg of the past Judges i 7 2 Sam iii 7 viii x5 Jer xxvi 18 20 2 Kings xvii 32 33 of the future Gen i 6 Deut xxviii 293 Isa xxx 20 with

Esther ii 7 15 and with rv9 a genuine MH construction i 22 viii 13 ix 21 The construction may have been even more common in the popular dialect in which the consecutive tenses seem to have been

BH cf Barth Etymol Studien p 39 2 Cf Tenses  I35 5 and with fuller lists Sellin op cit p 35 and Kahan p 25 3 Note the parallels torn and nn Cf above p 683MISNAIC HEBREW BIBLICAL HEBREW AND ARAMAIC 699 being primarily intended for private use were but little influenced by the literary tradition and therefore approached most nearly to the actually spoken Hebrew of the day With the complete disappearance of the consecutive perfect in MH and the tendency which this idiom displays to confine the simple tenses to the expression of single acts in the past and future respectively the regular employment of the participle as a frequentative and iterative became a necessity But the participle being incapable owing to its nominal character of expressing any relation of time has to be accompanied wherever possible 1 by the auxiliary verb in order to indicate the time in which the act expressed by the participle occurs The same construction is also regularly employed in modern Arabic2 and is therefore a characteristic common to all those Semitic dialects in a late stage of their development which had been capable at an earlier period of developing the verbal faculty of their participles3 That in none of these dialects is the con struction found so early and so extensively as in the Aram is due simply to the fact that of all the Semitic languages Aram was with the exception perhaps of Assyrian the first to reach its decline and to suffer the disintegration of its inflexional system and its primitive syntax It must of course be conceded that the example of Aram exercised a potent influence upon the development of the construction in MH but on the other hand there is no doubt whatever considering the BH instances referred to above that Hebrew even more so than Arabic would have developed the construction even without any external aid whatever All that Aram influence could have done was to hasten the extension and firm establishment of an already existing native construction to the exclusion of other and older modes of expression 1 ie in the preterite future and imperative but not in the present e g  1p n Berak I I so Koh i 4 Cn c c 2 Cf Spitta  Io9e i66 3 It does not occur in Ethiopic as the participle of this language had early become fossilized into a real noun Cf Dillmann  123700 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW On the other hand it is worthy of note that the tenses are never found in MH combined with nn as occasionally in the Targumim eg Gen iv i Jon nrnn min  Cant i iz p K1n 1 and very frequently in Syriac Nold Syr Gr  263 268 and in Arabic Wright Ar Gr3 II  3 c also once in Phoenician lv p Cooke op cit No 371 5 evidently because there is nothing in BH approaching such a use of the tenses 2 We see therefore that Aram was incapable of forcing upon MH anything which was foreign to the nature of Hebrew as exemplified in the Biblical books 5 THE WEAK VERBS Of the verbs which have a weak letter as their first radical none exhibit any notable variations from the BH types except in the infinitive discussed above p 685 f The inflexion of the other weak verbs also generally runs on BH lines even where MH seems to differ from the normal forms of BH Aramaic influence is noticeable here and there but only as accentuating and extending forms already existing in Hebrew In many cases however MIH pursued its own course unaffected by Aram influence Thus in verbs Yy Aram usually has the contracted forms except in the Ethpeel3 The natural affinity of these verbs with verbs 1 is preserved and accentuated much more strongly in Aram than in the other Semitic languages BH on the other hand as also the other Semitic languages shows a tendency to make these verbs approximate to the standard type of the strong triliteral verb and hence exhibits a large number of augmented forms on the analogy of the strong verb This tendency is carried still further by MH It has indeed preserved a considerable number of biliteral I Cf Winer  4 5 i The scarcity of this construction in the Targumim is due to Hebrew influence 2 Cf Kinig Syntax  122 3 N6ld Syr Gr  I78 Winer  19 The augmented forms enumerated by Dalman

earlier Hebrew possessed the power of converting the vocalic middle radical into a hard consonant is shown by the cognate nouns I 11 c and by the uncontracted verbs like nlV m n8 which as Konig shows3 belonged originally to the same class as the contracted verbs the hardness of the waw being caused by the presence of other weak letters in the root It would therefore be but reason able to expect

There can be no doubt what ever that this formation is genuinely Hebraic Its use must have been confined to colloquial and familiar speech in which diminutives abound in almost all languages Hence its absence in the literary dialect of BH and its occurrence in Isaiahs parody of the speech of drunkards Isa xxviii o1 I3 four times and in the deliberately familiar and condescending words which Elihu

3 THE PLURAL The plural termination of masc nouns is in MH almost as often P as 13 This is especially the case in participles This termination is not an Aramaism The n is common to nearly all Semitic languages 1 and is the only form found on the Mega stone though Phoenician uses only im In BH the form in is found pretty often 2 and as early as the Song of Deborah lt Judges v o and must have been more common in the spoken language than in the literary dialect Its frequent occurrence in poetry tends to support this view For unlike the prose writer the poet does not easily allow himself to be fettered by convention and fixed rules and if he be especially a lyrical poet as almost all Hebrew poets are he will give expression to his feelings and thoughts in a style and in a form which are most natural to him The poetical parts of the Bible therefore present in many respects a more accurate picture of the language of their time than the contemporary prose which we may assume on the analogy of the literary style of other languages had to conform to a certain standard set up by earlier writers and to employ only the forms and expression current in the polite but in many respects artificial language of the educated classes So that in the case of the plural termination also we find MH preserving and extending a feature peculiar to the spoken language of Biblical times as distinguished from the literary language of the Biblical books 1 Cf the table in Zimmerns Vergl Gr p 74 3 Cf also Sirach Pl3O pirno xiii 22 jh xvi 15 3B714 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Besides the

natural explanation of these MH plurals seems to the writer to be the following The vowel d was inserted before 1i  from a desire to make these plurals especially those of recently acquired nouns conform to the standard type of feminine plurals which has the vowel a before the termination i eg nD5n niprI 4 and for the sake of euphony an R or 9 was inserted between this vowel a and the

of the construct state Circumlocution of the genitive is resorted to as a rule only in certain cases and under certain restrictions viz when the grammar or the desire for lucidity and precision would make the employment of the constr st awkward or impracticable MH differs in this respect also from Aramaic The latter too in the earlier Jewish dialects makes a most extensive use of the constr st But in MH the respective usages of the constr st and of circumlocution can be classified under certain headings and explained by certain logical and grammatical rules in Aramaic on the other hand the two constructions are found side by side without any apparent cause I The dual is often spelt n  2 ie the limbs on which the c5I the feathers grow Hence the Migna says 1ra i ninxc but nm mCim 3 So

outward semblance of an inflexional distinction leaving thus the relation existing between the nouns ambiguous and uncertain and it will be easy to understand the necessity felt by the Semitic

is confined to the poetical style GesK  xi6 h 3 Kautzsch Bib Aram  8I footnote ascribes the origin of the circum locution of the genitive to the desire of making the regens definite But it is evident that this desire was only one of the many causes at work since circumlocution is very common in languages like Assyrian and Ethiopic which do not possess the article or its equivalent Further we have cases in Hebrew where circumlocution was chosen for the special purpose of leaving the nouns indefinite e g I Sam xvi I8 5 la I Kings ii 39 rYJ DI Cf cf GesK  129 c722 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW no longer capable of producing any internal or inflexional change in the nouns concerned they had to fall back upon a periphrasis of the genitive This they did by inserting a particle between the two nouns In the selection of this particle the Semitic languages divide themselves into two groups Those languages in which the period of decay set in early in their history when their mode of thought was still of a primitive nature viz the Assyrian the Aramaic dialects and the Ethiopic selected for this peri phrasis the demonstrative particle which had already come into use as a connective link in the form of a relative Assyrian a Aramaic   and finally   Ethiopic H  1 Thus in 5O n liv domus iste rex the particle s merely points out that there is a connexion between the two nouns without attempting in the least to indicate explicitly what that connexion is Convention alone determined that the connexion should be understood as that of the genitive relation just as it was convention alone that determined the relation of a clause introduced by the same particle to the principle clause of the sentence2 The particle thus used as a genitive did therefore as much as the older constr st For the latter did no more at least in historical times than merely indicate by its juxtaposition with the rectum and its hurried pronunciation often producing a vocalic change that some kind of connexion existed between the two nouns which connexion was commonly understood to be that of the genitive Those Semitic languages however which had been endowed with greater vitality and did not feel

It was found necessary to indicate quite clearly the relation subsisting between the noun and its genitive Classical Arabic with its highly developed inflexional system in which moreover annexion had been fortified by a real genitive termination attached to the rectvum seems to have never experienced any real need for a substitute to this construction Only occasionally do we find the genitive of material expressed by circumlocution with  1 But Modern Arabic in consequence of the loss or confusion of the old caseendings has felt itself compelled to devise some periphrasis of the genitive In the Egyptian Arabic annexion is being supplanted by a circumlocution which is expressed by placing the noun betF property possession between the regens and rectumn where it signifies peculiar to belonging to It stands in appo sition to the regens and in constr st to the rectum the latter being thus governed by it and subordinated to it as its genitive 2 In Hebrew circumlocution of the genitive is expressed by the preposition 5  belonging to and the construction is exactly the same as in Modern Arabic Thus in ltntn ni or nv 5 ninn the 5 stands in apposition to nintn and mnm while miq and Iwi 3 are governed by and subordinated to the preposition as its genitive3 This primitive construction however of simple apposition between the regens and the preposition had to give way in this case as also in other cases to a smoother and more logical construction4 in which the connexion between the regens and the preposition was specified by the originally demonstrative link nWK so

for expressing circumlocution of the genitive but which must have existed in popular speech long before it was reluctantly admitted into the literary dialect of BH So in Phoenician the periphrasis of the genitive is effected by prefixing  to the rectum and then by   5 iw and finally by 5w Only in very late times under the overpowering influence of Aramaic against which it was apparently more powerless than MH Phoenician often uses for the genitive simply  3 The foregoing remarks prove conclusively that the MH circumlocution of the genitive with 5w is an original Hebrew construction and not an adaptation of the Aramaic circumlocution with ri For the two particles differ most essentially and radically  indicates some vague connexion between the two nouns which it joins together while

pronoun or pronominal suffix is a genuine Hebrew idiom and not an Aramaism The idiom is moreover extremely common in Assyrian before a genitive introduced by sa The genitive so introduced may even precede the regens with the attached suffix Delitzsch  I66 3 It is also widely used in Ethiopic whenever the noun is to be conceived as determinate both in the genitive and in the accusative the particle introducing the noun being always A  even with the genitive and not H t as in simple circumlocution cf Dillmann  172 c It follows therefore that the anticipatory constructions in MH are of native origin and not borrowed from the Aramaic though the latter may have exercised some influence upon their usage It may be remarked that the idiom appears to be in its origin a colloquialism one might almost say a vulgarisrm implying a lack of precision in thought and in expression The speaker at first deems it sufficient to refer to the noun by means of a pronoun or more commonly a pronominal suffix but recollecting that the hearer may be in doubt as to whom the suffix refers he adds as an afterthought a clause containing the real name of the person or thing which he has in his mind The noun being thus expressed twice became emphatic gradually the idiom began to be used more frequently and then regularly whenever any 1 Cf Driver LOT p 538 No 3g732 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW

the foregoing pages to enable us to answer with a certain degree of confidence the questions with which we set out at the beginning of this inquiry Our survey of some of the chief features of MH grammar has revealed the fact that as far as strict grammar is concerned MH is absolutely independent of Aramaic that it is identical in the main with BH and where it differs from the latter the genesis of the differ ences can generally be traced back to an older stage of the language out of which the new forms have developed in a natural and methodical manner We have met with a considerable number of forms and constructions which are quite unknown in Aramaic Some of these are found in BH in isolated cases and in others it is possible at least to trace their connexion with BH prototypes but what is most important nearly all of them bear the stamp of colloquial usage and of popular development while on the other hand not a single trace has been discovered of that artificiality with which the MH idiom has been commonly credited In fact the colloquial and popular character of MH grammar is so strongly pronounced that it helps us in many cases to distinguish in BH colloquial or dialectal forms and phrases from the literary and polite ones a fact which if elaborated with proper care and discrimination may have an important bearing upon many problems in Biblical criticism Maany grammatical phenomena especially in the realm of syntax which had been hitherto regarded as peculiar to Aramaic and the occurrence of which in MH and also in BH had been attributed to Aramaic influence have been shown to be common to all or several of the Semitic dialects in a later phase of their existence and therefore as indigenous in Hebrew as in any of its sister languages No doubt Aramaic did exercise a profound and far reaching influence upon MH but this influence was confined to the vocabulary and hardly extended to the grammar at all except indirectly in so far as the alteredMISNAIC HEBREW BIBLICAL HEBREW AND ARAMAIC 735 vocabulary and phraseology tended also to modify in some measure the grammatical construction of the language The answer therefore which grammar has to offer to the question whether MH was a natural living and popular dialect developed gradually and systematically out of old Hebrew or merely an artificial and mechanical scholastic jargon which masqueraded as a kind of Hebrew but was really a bad Aramaic in disguise is decidedly and unequivocally in favour of the former alternative and this answer must be taken to settle the question once and for all The presence of so many Aramaic words and phrases in MH can as little affect its genuineness as for example the preponderance of the Latin element in the English dictionary can affect the genuine Teutonic character of the English language or let it be said as little as the presence in Aramaic itself of so many Hebrew and other foreign words and phrases can affect the genuine and originally Aramean character of the language of Syria and Mesopotamia Nay on a closer examination the MH vocabulary itself will be found to support strongly the verdict of the grammar Without entering for the present upon this very desirable examination it may be stated here that the MR vocabulary consists of two main divisions each of which has to be suldivided again into three smaller groups viz 1 Words common to MH and BH I Words used in MIH in the same connotation and in the same form as in BH z Words used in MH in the same connotation but in slightly altered form often approaching or similar to Aramaic usage 3 Words used in MH in a different connotation often agreeing with Aramaic usage II Words found in MH but not in BH I Words peculiar to MH not found in Aramaic or only as MH loanwords but often found in other Semitic languages736 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW 2 Words common to MH and to Aramaic either as originally common Semitic or North Semitic words or as loanwords in both dialects from foreign languages notably Assyrian Iranian and the classical languages or as mutual loanwords in IH and Aramaic 3 Words borrowed by MH from Aramaic It will be seen that Aramaic influence comes in only in group II 3 and to some extent in groups I 2 3 while group I I and especially group II I a considerable pro portion of which consists of words connected with the arts and crafts and other occupations of everyday life can only be reasonably accounted for by the assumption that Hebrew continued to be a living medium of speech up to and including the MH period Group II z includes a large number of words in which priority may be claimed by either dialect but in the case of words connected with the religious and ethical aspects of life the presumption will generally have to be in favour of MH It cannot be repeated too often that the vocabulary of the Old Testament contains but a part and possibly only a small part of the stock of words possessed by the Hebrew language It is therefore unreasonable to assign to Aramaic all such words in MH which are not found in BH1 As a matter of fact the muchtalkedof Aramaic influence upon postexilic BH was comparatively insignificant even in the sphere of vocabulary2 and much more insignificant in the sphere of grammar Many of the socalled grammatical Aramaisms in the Old Testament are nothing but colloquial or dialectal but none the less genuine Hebraic forms which generally turn up again as the normal types in MH as we have often had occasion to point out in the preceding pages For both in respect of grammar as well as in respect of 1 As is done by S Mannes in his dissertation bUber d Einfluss d Aram auf delz Wortschatz d Miinah Berlin I897 In spite of all his partiality for Aramaic he has only

XXVII OBSERVATIONS ON THE GASTRIC GLANDS OF THE HUMAN STO MACH AND THE CONTRACTION WHICH TAKES PLACE IN THAT VISCUS BY SIR EVERARD HOME BART V P R S READ JUNE 26 1817 I N THE YEAR 1807 I LAID BEFORE THE ROYAL SOCIETY SOME OBSER VATIONS ON THE HUMAN STOMACH AND I AM NOW ENABLED THROUGH THE ASSISTANCE OF MR BAUER TO EXHIBIT MAGNIFIED VIEWS OF THE INTERNAL MEMBRANE OF THAT VISCUS IN WHICH THE DIFFERENT STRUCTURES COMPOSING ITS SURFACE ARE DISTINCTLY SHOWN THE MAGNIFIED DRAWINGS OF THE GASTRIC GLANDS OF THE JAVA SWALLOW SO LATELY EXHIBITED MUST STILL REST UPON THE MINDS OF THOSE MEMBERS WHO SAW THEM THEY ARE OF SO INSTRUCTIVE A NATURE THAT I WAS LED TO REQUEST MR BAUER WOULD MAKE SIMILAR REPRESENTATIONS OF THE GLANDS OF THE LOWER PART OF THE HUMAN OESOPHAGUS AND OF THE SURFACE OF THE INTERNAL MEM BRANE OF THE STOMACH AND DUODENUM THE STOMACH EMPLOYED FOR THIS PURPOSE WAS UNDER THE MOST FAVOURABLE CIRCUMSTANCES AS THE PATIENT HAD DIED OF AN APOPLEXY HAVING NO OTHER BODILY COMPLAINT THE GLANDS SITUATED IN THE LINING OF THE LOWER PART OF THE CESOPHAGUS WHICH IN MY FORMER PAPER WERE CALLED CESOPHA GEAL GLANDS WHEN EXAMINED IN THE MICROSCOPE HAVE THE APPEARANCE OF INFUNDIBULAR CELLS WHOSE DEPTH DOES NOT EXCEED THE THICKNESS OF THE MEMBRANE THIS STRUCTURE HOWEVER DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE GASTRIC GLANDS OF BIRDS IS A NEARER848 SIOR EVERARD HOMES OBSERVATIONS ON APPROACH TO IT THAN IS TO BE MET WITH ON ANY PART OF THE INTERNAL SURFACE OF THE STOMACH OR DUODENUM IT ALSO RE SEMBLES THEM IN THE SECRETION IT PRODUCES COAGULATING MILK AND NONE OF THE INSPISSATED JUICES MET WITH IN THESE CAVITIES AFFECT MILK IN THE SAME WAY FRON THESE FACTS THERE CAN NO LONGER BE ANY DOUBT ENTERTAINED THAT THE GASTRIC GLANDS HAVE THE SAME SITUATION RESPECTING THE CAVITY OF THE STOMACH AS IN BIRDS IN MY FORMER INVESTIGATION THE ANALOGY OF THE BIRD WOULD HAVE LED ME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION HAD NOT THE GASTRIC GLANDS OF THE BEAVER WHICH ARE MORE DISTINCT THAN IN ANY OTHER QUADRUPED BEEN A STUMBLING BLOCK IN MY WAY BUT NOW THE SITUATION OF THESE GLANDS IN THE BEAVER AND WOOMBAT MUST BE CONSIDERED AS AN EXCEPTION TO THE GENERAL RULE THE NECESSARY COMPLEXITY OF THEIR STRUCTURE MAKING THEM TOO LARGE TO ADMIT OF THEIR BEING CONVENIENTLY PLACED AS IS USUAL IN THE CESOPHAGUS THE STRUCTURE UPON THE UPPER ARCH OF THE STOMACH WHICH WHEN MAGNIFIED BY A COMMON LENS HAD THE APPEARANCE OF GLANDS IS SHOWN BY MR BAUER TO BE MADE UP OF CELLS IN THE FORM OF A HONEYCOMB THE SIDES OF WHICH ARE NOT FORMED BY DOUBLINGS OF THE MEMBRANE FOR NO STRETCHING OF THE CELLS ALTERS THE FORM OF THEIR ORIFICES BUT ARE REGULAR PARTITIONS CONSTRUCTED BETWEEN THE CELLS THIS HONEYCOMB STRUCTURE CONSISTS OF CELLS OF THE GREATEST DEPTH IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUA TION BUT IT IS MET WITH OVER THE WHOLE SURFACE OF THE CAR DIAC PORTION OF THE STOMACH ONLY THE APPEARANCE IS SO FAINT AS TO REQUIRE A GREAT MAGNIFYING POWER TO RENDER IT VISIBLE IN THE PYLORIC PORTION THE CELLS IN GENERAL HAVE THE SAME APPEARANCE BUT THERE ARE SMALL CLUSTERS THE SIDES OF WHICHTHE GASTRC GLANDS OF THE HUMAN STOMACH C  49 RISE ABOVE THE SURFACE GIVING THE APPEARANCE OF FOLIATED MEMBRANES IN THE DUODENUM THIS TAKES PLACE IN A GREATER DEGREE AND THE LOOSE EDGES OF THESE MENIBRANES WHEN EN TANGLED IN THE MUCUS THAT COVERS THEM PUTS ON AN APPEARANCE OF ROUNDED GLANDULAR BODIES BUT THESE ADMITTED OF BEING EXPANDED SO AS TO EXPLAIN THE DECEPTION THE DESCRIPTION WHICH I HAVE GIVEN OF THE INTERNAL MEM BRANE OF THE STOMACH PROVES HOW NEARLY MY LATE INGENIOUS FRIEND DR GEORGE FORDYCE WHO EXAMINED ITS SURFACE WITH VERY INFERIOR MEANS TO THOSE EMPLOYED UPON THE PRESENT OCCASION HAD APPROACHED THE TRUTH WHEN HE DECLARED IT TO BE COMPOSED OF CELLULAR MEMBRANE I HAVE SHOWN UPON MORE OCCASIONS THAN ONE THAT THE GAS TRIC GLANDS ARE BOTH LARGEST AND MOST NUMEROUS IN THOSE ANI MALS DESTINED TO INHABIT THE LEAST FERTILE REGIONS OF THE EARTH AND ARE SMALLEST AS WELL AS FEWEST WHERE THE SUPPLY OF FOOD IS MOST ABUNDANT TO PREVENT THE BODY BEING INJURED BY THE EFFECTS OF OVER FEEDING IF THIS ARRANGEMENT WAS NECESSARY IN ANIMALS IT BECAME STILL MORE SO IN MAN WHOSE MEANS OF PROCURING AND PREPARING FOOD FOR HIMSELF SO MUCH EXCEED THOSE OFALL OTHER ANIMALS AND WHO IS CONTRARY TO HIS REASON TOO READILY DISPOSED TO CARRY THE INDULGENCIES OF THE TABLE TO EXCESS IN HIM THE GASTRIC GLANDS AS IT WAS NATURAL TO EX PECT ARE SO SMALL AS TO REQUIRE THE AID OF MR BAUERS MIX CROSCOPE TO PROVE THAT THEY BELONG TO THE SAME SERIES OF STRUCTURES AS THE GASTRIC GLANDS OF THE OSTRICH WHICH ADMIT OF BEING MINUTELY EXAMINED BY THE NAKED EYE MUCH IS STILL WANTING TO ENABLE US TO UNDERSTAND THE PRO CESS OF DIGESTION IT IS HOWEVER NO SMALL STEP IN THIS INVEST GATIQO THAT A MORE CORRECT KNOWLEDGE OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE350 SIR EVERARD HOMES OBSERVATIONS ON CAVITIES IN WHICH IT TAKES PLACE HAS BEEN ACQUIRED FRO M WHICH WE LEARN THAT THERE ARE THREE DIFFERENT KINDS OF ORGANIZATION EMPLOYED IN ADDING TO THE FOOD THREE DIFFERENT INGREDIENTS WHICH ARE REQUISITE FOR ITS CONVERSION INTO A MATERIAL THAT CAN BE ASSIMILATED WITH LIVING ANIMAL MATTER AND BE EMPLOYED IN CARRYING ON THE FUNCTIONS OF LIFE ALSO SUPPLYING THE WASTE WHICH IS CONSTANTLY TAKING PLACE THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE IS EVIDENTLY THE GASTRIC GLANDS NEXT IN ORDER MAY BE CONSIDERED THE HONEYCOMB STRUCTURE AND LEAST SO ALTHOUGH BY NO MEANS UNNECESSARY THE FOLIATED MEMBRANES WHICH WE KNOW FROM WHAT TAKES PLACE IN THE JAVA SWALLOW FORM THE MUCUS THAT IS MIXED WITH THE OTHER INGREDIENTS THAT THE STOMACH IS OCCASIONALLY MET WITH AFTER DEATH DIVIDED INTO TWO PORTIONS BY A MUSCULAR CONTRACTION T HAVE SHOWN UPON A FORMER OCCASION AND I HAVE THERE GIVEN IT AS MY OPINION THAT THIS TAKES PLACE WHILE THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS GOING ON THIS OPINION MAY IN THE MINDS OF MANY PHYSIOLOGISTS REQUIRE SOME STRONGER PROOFS THAN I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GIVE BUT THIS LIKE MANY OTHER MUSCULAR CON TRACTIONS WHICH TAKE PLACE DURING LIFE IS SO OFTEN REMOVED IN THE VERY ACT OF DYING AS RARELY AND IN SOME OF THEM NEVER TO BE SEEN AFTER DEATH WE ARE THEREFORE INDEBTED TO THE EFFECT OF DISEASE SOMETIMES RENDERING THEM PERMANENT FOR ANY KNOWSLEDGE WE HAVE OF THEIR EXISTENCE IN THIS WAY STRICTURES IN THE CESOPHAGUS JUST WHERE THE FAUCES TERMINATE AND THE CESOPHAGUS BEGINS BEING OF FREQUENT OCCURRENCE AND UPON EXAMINATION OF THE PARTS AFTER LEATH FOUND TO HAVE TAKEN PLACE UNCONNECTED WITH ANY DISEASE IN THE SURROUNDIZNG PARTS TEACHES US THAT THIS PART HAS AN INVO LUNTARY CONTRACTION WHEN ANY IRRITATING MATTER IS APPLIED ANDTHE GASTRIC GIANDS OF THE HUMAN STOMACH C THUS FORMS A GUARD TO PREVENT SUBSTANCES THAT VWOULD PROVE HURTFUL TO THE STOMACH FROM BEING SWALLOWED STRICTURES IN THE URETHRA IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THE CAVITY OF THE BULBSBEING MET WITH UNDER THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES AFTER THE USE OF IRRITATING INJECTIONS INTO THAT CANAL AND VARIOUS OTHER CAUSES  OF IRRITATION IS THE ONLY EVIDENCE WE HAVE OF THIS PARTBHAVING AIR POWER OF INVOLUNTARY CONTRACTIONH WHICH IIN THE ACT OF THE COITUS IS EMPLOYED TO PREVENT ANY PART OF THE SEMEN FROM BEING FORCED BACKWARDS INTO THE BLADDER THROUGH THE KINDNESS OF MR CARPUE I AM NOW ENABLED TO PRODUCE A SPECIMEN OF PERMANENT CONTRACTION IN THE STO MACH AND IF I HAD NOT OBSERVED SUCH A CONTRACTION BEFORE THIS SPECIMEN WOULD HAVE LED AS IN THE OTHER CASES JUST MENU TIONED TO THE DISCOVERY OF THE STOMACH IN SOME OF ITS NATURAL ACTIONS HAVING THIS KIND OF CONTRACTION TAKE PLACE IN IT IT WAS MET WITH IN THE BODY OF A WOMAN AND WAS PROBABLY THE CAUSE OF HER DEATH AS NO OTHER APPEARANCE OF DISEASEWAS MET WITH THE BODY WAS EXCEEDINGLY EMACIATED BUT THERE WAS NO OPPORTUNITY OF ACQUIRING ANY INF6RMATION OF THE SYMPTOMS UNDER WHICH SHE LABOURED WHILE ALIVE AS IN THIS INSTANCE THE STOMACH COULD BE DISTENDED FREELY WITHOUT ANY RISK OF THE CONTRACTION GIVING WAY THE LINE OF PARTITION BETWEEN THE CARDIAC AND PYLORIC PORTIONS IS EXACTLY DEFINED AND SHOWN IN THE DRAWING NOT TO BE THE CASUAL CON TRACTION OF A FEVW OFTHE TRANSVERSE MUSCULAR FIBRES WHICH MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED EQUALLY TO ANY OF THE OTHERS BUT THE CONTRACTION OF A PART THAT HAD ALWAYS BEEN LIABLE TO IT AND WHICH WAS TO ANSWER SOME PURPOSE IN THE PERFORMANCE OF TNE FUNCTIONS OF THAT VISCUS THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS FACT IN STUDYING THE PHYSIOLOGY OF ILDDCCXVII Z Z352 SIR EVERARD HOMES OBSERVATZONS C THE STOMACH IS THE ONLY APOLOGY I SHALL MAKE

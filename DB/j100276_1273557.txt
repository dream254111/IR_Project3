the last American Bar Association and consideration of the legal problems growing out of modern commercial combinations was urged as a matter proper for dis cussion and action by that association it was gravely argued by distinguished lawyers present that there was no legal problem to be solved The Committee on Commercial Law however thought otherwise and said The American people look to the American Bar for leadership on this question Some one must lead If not the lawyer then it will be the demagogue I Is there a legal problem involved The writer thinks there is this view however having been challenged perhaps it is worth while to recall something of the basis for the general belief that there is a problem of a legal character Early in the seventies railroad amalgamation and pools became frequent and to counteract in some measure the result the state legislatures very promptly established railroad commissions and passed maximum rate laws In the eighties the alliance between large shippers and transportation companies with glaring freight discriminations was made clear by the investigations of the Ohio New York and Ontario legislatures and the United States Con gress and twenty or more State Antitrust Acts1 and the Interstate Commerce Act2 and the National Antitrust Acts3 were passed These proved insufficient and combination and discrimination con tinued Just before the Chicago Trust Conference held in Sept 1899 the Civic Federation gathered the opinions of a great number of business men throughout the country as to what was the effect of these combinations with

were a menace to the people and most of them believed in federal control While the trust conference itself passed no resolutions on the subject the vast majority of the speeches indicated an apprehension of grave danger and suggested various legal remedies The trust conference of the governors and attorneysgeneral held at St Louis at the same time vigorously denounced such combinations and recommended radical legal remedies The platforms of the political parties for several years have resolved that there is danger from such combinations and urged legislative action the messages of the governors and presidents have done likewise Many of the states in the past few years have passed more stringent antitrust acts and many bills have been before Congress looking to further legal regulation The Industrial Commission after the fullest investigation with out dissent considered that a great many things were out of joint and urged in detail many legal remedies2 some of which found expression or partial expression in the act3 to forward the prosecu tion of offenders against the antitrust and interstate commerce laws the antirebate act4 and the act5 creating the Department of Commerce and Labor Such a consensus of opinion and action would indicate there is a legal problem involved II Genesis of the problem The leading legal conditions under which the problem has developed have been the following 1 The exclusive power of the National Government to control interstate commerce 2 The unprecedented growth of corporations and corporate power 3 The power of corporations to engage in interstate commerce 4 The inaction of Congress in regulating such commerce A short review of these may make clearer the policy power duty and method of meeting the problem 1 The first

French forts above Pittsburg on the Allegheny river to inquire by what authority the French were and to warn them from invading Virginia territory1 Upon his return he urged upon the governor the subject of uniting the East and West by means of a public highway2 Though not heeded Washingtons idea grew into a picture of commercial grandeur for the Old Dominion to be attained by building a highway over the mountains and connect ing its eastern and western termini with navigable waterways natural or if necessary artificial3 The plan filled his mind and he studied maps and routes in detail and urged the desirability of the project among his friends In 1774 after another western trip he brought his plan before the House of Burgesses of Virginia by introducing and moving the adoption of a bill which empow ered individuals to subscribe toward such an enterprise and con struct a communication at their own expense A similar bill was brought before the Assembly of Maryland but jealousies regarding western trade between Georgetown and Baltimore Md prevented favorable action by either state Then the revolution came and for ten years Washington could give no further attention to these plans After the success of the revolution the project was of national importanceto bind the East and West with the iron bands of commercial intercourse and sympathy4 to overcome the mountain divide and to counteract the tendency of the trade of the then West to glide down the Mis sissippi to the Spanish ports To forward his plans Washington had surveyed at his own expense the roadway over the mountains from Cumberland Md to the Ohio river and this road twenty years later became the chain of the Federal Union by the construction on the same route of the National road and later by the construction of the Chesa peake and Ohio canal and the Baltimore and Ohio railroad In 1784 he made another western trip and on his return reported to the governor of Virginia urging legislative action saying in a letter the object in my estimation is of vast commercial and polit ical importance5 1 Historic Highways A B Hulbert Vol 3 p 108 2 Historic Highways A B Hulbert Vol 3 p

chartered by Vir ginia and Maryland1 A joint commission to regulate the naviga tion of Chesapeake bay was appointed in 1785 by these two states and this met at Mt Vernon for consultation with Washington His broader plans contemplated connecting the navigation of the bay and the Potomac in some way with that of the Ohio this would require Pennsylvania to join and Washington also urged that Maryland and Virginia should settle upon a uniform system of duties commercial regulations and currency These suggestions were sent to the legislatures of the two states Maryland adopted them and added that Delaware should also be consulted and a con ference of commissioners from all the states should be called A little later the Virginia legislature passed a resolution based upon the report

other important matters Only five states responded to the call and nothing could be done except to recommend the calling of another convention Hamilton wrote the report and call of the commissioners saying In the course of their reflections   they have been induced to think that the power of regulating trade is of such comprehensive extent and will enter so far into the general system of the

order to promote the general welfare  The third enumerated powersecond only to the taxing and bor rowing powersgiven to Congress was To regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states and with the Indian tribes3 and as Mr Justice Miller4 has said without such relief As a nation we must soon have perished    What our deranged finances our discreditable failure to pay our debts and the sufferings of our soldiers could not force the several states of the American Union to attempt was brought about by a desire to be released from the evils of an unregulated and burdensome commercial intercourse both with foreign nations and between the several states It is not too strong to say that one of the most fundamental reasons for the creation of our Federal

impairing the obligation of contracts4 In 1782 James Wilson had argued that the charter of the Bank of North America was a compact between the bank and the state of Pennsylvania5 and in 1819 ten years before the steam railroad was born the Supreme Court in the Dartmouth College case6had held that a corporate charter was a contract between the state and the corporation protected by this provision Although it was suggested that the state might retain control over the corporations it created by reserving in their charters a right to amend or repeal such practice did not become common until many years later As early as 1821 the improvident increase of corporations was looked upon as an evil which was restrictive of individual rights and constitutional provisions requiring twothirds votes for their creation were made but were ineffectual7 Finally between 183050 because of the confusion corruption partial and inequitable legislation that was the result of allowing parties to go before the legislature and ask for a special charter the bars were almost entirely thrown down by the passing of general incorporation laws in nearly all the states allowing a few persons in a very simple way to obtain valuable corporate franchises and privileges subject to very slight control and super vision Since general corporation laws have been passed and the right to repeal or amend charters has been reserved therein it has not been an unusual practice for corporations formed under general laws to purchase or obtain control over the charter of some earlier corporation organized under a special act wherein such right was not retained by the state and thereby to hold their rights and privileges under a contract the obligation of which the state may not impair Great numbers of railroads were originally incorporated or since have reorganized and operate under special charters8 Thirty years ago so conservative a writer as Judge Cooley observed 1 In 1784 2 In 1787 s In 1791 4 Sec X Art I  4

and threatening powers in our country have been created some of the great and wealthy corporations having greater influence in the country at large and upon the legislation of the country than the states to which they owe their existence L 3 Power of corporations to engage in interstate commerce By the common law a corporation was considered a person within the law and though perhaps it could not migrate itself it mightthrough its agents do business away from home The common law had recognized the right to bring a suit in a country other than the one in which it was incorporated2 Such a right was recognized in the Supreme Court of the United States as early as 18093 and by the New York courts in 18204 although such rights had undoubtedly longbeen exercised before And in 1839 when the question came before the Supreme Court5 it was expressly held that a bank organized in one state with a general power to discount bills and notes could exercise such power out of the state wherever it was found most convenient and profitable subiect to the laws of the state where exercised and while it must dwell at home by the comity of states it may do business abroad It soon after became the generally accepted practice and doctrine that a corporation might do business and own property6 beyond its borders if its charter did not forbid7 or the laws of the state where it undertook to do business did not prevent From these premises it naturally followed that if a corporation was a person having an inherent capacity to do busi ness away from home and the business done was interstate or for eign commerce over which the states had no control then such a corporation could engage in that business in any state without the states consent Such was implied in Paul v Virginia 8 in 1868 and held in Pensacola Telegraph Co v Western Union Telegraph Co  and in Crutcher v Kentucky10 where it was held that one state 1 Const Lim p 27980 n 2d Ed 1871 2 Henriques v Dutch West India Co 2d Ld Raym

commerce from entering that state and carrying on its business therein the court by Mr Justice Bradley saying further To carry on interstate commerce is not a franchise or privilege granted by the state it is a right which every citizen of the United States is entitled to exercise under the Constitution and laws of the United States and the acces sion of mere corporate facilities as a matter of convenience in carrying on their business cannot have the effect of depriving them of such right unless Congress should see fit to interpose some contrary regulation on the subject 4 Inaction of Congress As early as 1824 the Supreme Court overruling the Court of Errors of New York construed the word regulate in the commerce clause to imply full power over the thing to be regulated and to exclude the actions of all others while Con gress is regulating it that the power is complete in itself may be exercised to its utmost extent and acknowledges no limitations other than such as are prescribed in the Constitution From this view it naturally followed as it was afterward acted upon and finally held in 18512 and 18873 that Where the subject is national in character and admits or requires uni formity of legislation the absence of any law of Congress on the subject is equivalent to its declaration that commerce in that matter shall be free Congress until very recently has allowed interstate commerce except in minor matters to go unregulated by any action of its own In 1887 the Interstate Commerce Commission was established but after continuous and protracted litigation was emasculated in 1897 into a reporting and recommending body merely by the decision of the Supreme Court4 In 1890 the antitrust act was passed and almost immediately in the lower courts5 it was held not to apply to combi nations of manufacturers even though their products were made for and entered into interstate trade and this view was confirmed by the Supreme Court in 18956 For a period these decisions seemed wholly to defeat the design of the act but later decisions have in a measure redeemed its efficiency7 The act of last winter establish 1Gibbons v Ogden 9 Wheat 1 1 Kent Comm 432 t

only and its powers in these particulars are already reported to have been challenged by the Standard Oil Company 5 The best summary I have seen upon the questions involved in this and the preceding section of the propositions which have been adjudicated so often as to be no longer open to discussion with the cases supporting them is that of Mr Justice Brewer in Atlantic and Pacific Telegraph Co v Philadelphial as follows First The Constitution of the United States having given to Congress the power to regulate commerce not only with foreign nations but among the several states that power is necessarily exclusive wherever the subjects of it are national in their character or admit only of one uniform system or plan of regulation Second No state can compel a party individual or corporation to pay for the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce Third This immunity does not prevent a state from imposing ordinary property taxes upon property having a situs within its territory and employed in interstate commexce Fourth The franchise of a corporation although that franchise is the business of interstate commerce is as a part of its property subject to state taxation providing at least the franchise is not derived from the United States Fifth No corporation even though engaged in interstate commerce can appropriate to its own use property public or private without liability to charge therefor III The problem 1 In general the problem is how to regulate the national commerce of the large statecreated corporations The actual regulation taken from the states by the Constitution and not exercised by the National Government has practically passed into the control of statecreated corporations and the question is shall it be left there without further regulation Whether or not it should be further regulated is a political and economic question if it should be further regulated the manner thereof is largely a legal question The problem is before us because of the inaction or inadequate action of Congress to meet the conditions In this regard it is analogous to the conditions existing before the National banking law was enacted The Constitution says  No state shall coin money emit bills of credit or make anything but gold and silver coin a legal tender in payment of debts2 As early as 1837 it was held that 1 190 U S 160 on 162 1902 2 Art I Sec X cl 1 366NEED OF A NATIONAL INCORPORATION LA W while the states could not issue money they could create a corpor ation and give it the power to issue money not making it a legal tender  and straightway we had as bad a currency as ever afflicted a suffering people Congress had the power to coin money and regulate the value thereof2 but had failed to establish a sufficient and uniform currency So far as the currency could be said to be regulated at all it was practically relegated to the private interests of 1600 Wild cat banks created in the several states with an infinite variety of special powers under charters largely based on ignorance intrigue favoritism or corruption without uniformity of creation management operation liability responsibility or regulation and issuing 10000 different kinds of notes So far as a national currency is concerned there was noadequate provision for one until the National banking act3 was passed and no uniform one until the state bank issues were taxed out of existence in 1865 2 Concentration of control Our commercial condition is simi larly an unregulated corporate regulation with the addition that the control of the main forces and instruments of commerce is now vested or centered in a few state created corporations that have become federal in operation federated in organization and imperial in power General Garfield thus characterized the situation thirty years ago The vast railroad and telegraph systems have virtually passed from the control of the States    The efforts of the States to regulate their railroads have amounted to but little more than feeble annoyance In many cases the corporations have treated such efforts as impertinent intermeddling   In these contests the corporations have become conscious of their strength and have entered upon the work of controlling the states If this was true in 1873 how much more cause for concern and need of adequate regulation are there arising from the develop ment since Prior to 1870 scarcely any railroad system was over 1000 miles in lengthconsolidation and effective pooling had only fairly begun between 1870 and 1890 railroad systems were formed controlling 5000 miles between 1890 and 1898 single systems of 10000 miles or over were formed and now the five principal systems aggregate nearly 150000 of the total 200000 miles of railroad in this country In 1900 onefourth of all the railroad shares were I Briscoe v Bank 11 Pet 257 2 Art I Sec VIII cl 5 s Acts Feby 251863 and June 3 1864 4 The Future of the Republic J A Garfield 2 Works p 61 367MAICHIGAN LA W RE VIEW held by other railroad companies and undoubtedly this has greatly increased since A late authority says that 19 railroad systems practically controlled by nine men closely associated in various ways operate 165321 miles or nearly 81 per cent of all the railroad mileage in the country1 Concentration in the industrial and financial fields has been even more rapid It has been stated that between 1860 and 1870 only two industrial trusts formed by combination of formerly competing concerns were created with a total capitalization of 13000000 between 1870 and 1880 four more were formed with 135000000 nominal capital between 1880 and 1890 eighteen more were formed with 228000000 and according to the last census there were then 183 combinations with a capitalization of 3619039200 in 1902 there were said to be 213 combinations with nearly 7000000 000 capitalization while a later authority says there are 850 indus trial combinations not including railroad mergers with a nominal capitalization of 9000000000 These vast sums are not the most important point the concentration of control is still more import ant This has already been noted as to railroads It has been said The property which the Amalgamated Copper Company now controls was once perhaps a thousand mining claims  It is estimated that the Stand ard Oil Company has taken by contract or by force the business of ten thou sand corporations and merchants in all parts of the Union2 The estimated wealth of the United States according to the census of 1900 was 94300000000 The control of a sum nominally equal to onetwelfth of this is represented by the 24 directors of the United States Steel Corporation they are also the influential directors in more than 200 companies that operate half the railroad mileage of the country dig and carry the iron and coal control the greatest oil copper sleeping car telegraph express agricultural implement bridge traction and shipping interests in the country also the five greatest insurance companies nine of the greatest banks and sixteen of the largest trust companies with their large chains of affiliated banks and trust companies throughout the country This group of men controls corporations with a nominal capitalization of 9000000000 and of the 24 two Mr Morgan and Mr Rockefeller are said virtually to control eight out of the nine billions3 I S S Pratt

NATIONAL INCORPORATION LA W 3 Extent of operations Not only is concentration of control important but the extent of operations is of great significance The Standard Oil wagon is seen in nearly every city village and hamlet in the land and its operations extend around the world The 213 or more separate plants of the United States Steel Corporation are located and operated in nearly half the states and its trade invades the markets of the world And so with many others As Mr Dill says The trusts today are a force and power national in extent National in extent in that their business not only extends throughout all of the original and acquired territory of this country but is rapidly overleaping the bound aries of our States and possessions entering into foreign countries and making rapid inroads into foreign markets and national in extent also in that their financial roots extend down and into every commonwealth and municipality of this country1 4 Form of organization The great aggregation of wealth repre sented the extraordinary concentration of its control and the vast extent of the operation are not more material than is the affiliated and federated form of organization Through the interholdings of corporation shares interests of the greatest diversity are held and controlled in harmony and through the method of the holding corporation is susceptible of unlimited extent concentration and duration There are now not only combinations of combinations but corporations of corporations joined in a federal union that can act with the speed the certainty the vigor and the effect of a monarchy and under the laws of many states where they are or may be formed with less responsibility to their constituents and to the public than any constitutional monarch in the world The order of the Standard Oil Co or of the United States Steel Corpo ration and of many others as to the prices of their products or of the raw material they use act with a directness and rapidity greater and affect a larger territory in a shorter time and without warning than the act of any legislature in the world 5 Laxity of state laws Under present laws in several states the directors may provide in the organization of the corporation for no effective control over their acts liabilities or operations by the members and the laws of such states provide no public control of consequence outside of taxation Most of these great corporations have been organized under the same laws as the United States Ship building Co or laws not even as strict as they are and allow of 1 Address

without certain and adequate remedy to the sufferers The shares of cor porations organized under the same laws and with no more pro tection are widely scattered over the land and if like transactions have not occurred or do not occur in many other cases it will not be because the laws are adequate to prevent them As a hotel man recently said in New York the shares are insecurities rather than any thing else and many a one finds himself in the same predicament as heI have made my pile and it is safely invested in Steel Common Amalgamated Copper and Shipbuilding securities and nobody can take it away from meor wont 6 Diversity of state laws The great diversity of state laws under which corporations may be formed confuse the investor and often mislead him to believe there is safety where there is none The vast variety of these laws and in many cases the uncertainty of their provisions make a jungle of confusion wherein the dis honest promoter or manager finds safety Aside from this many states by liberalizing their laws so as to induce corporations to incorporate within their borders for the revenue derived from the fees have made it possible to get a charter where there is No franchise tax no limit on capitalization no amount of stock required to be subscribed no state control no examination of books stock nonassessable keep office any where do business any where Some of the states make a business of spawning spurious cor porations to infest other states than the one in which they are incorporated with their nefarious practices and progeny 7 Methods used to build up trusts The methods whereby these institutions have been built up must also be considered From the investigations of our various commissions during the past twenty years it has been made certain that the particular devices used in most cases which have brought the problem before us in the con dition above pointed out have been mainly four 1 The acquisi tion practically of monopoly power either by grant of franchises of various kinds or through discrimination in transportation charges 2 The destruction of legitimate competition by the predatory competition of the holders of monopoly power 3 The overcapital ization of corporations and 4Dishonest and irresponsible corporate promotion and management The first three have been usual and the last not infrequent The first three have hardly been unequi 370NEED OF A NATIONAL INCORPORA TION LA W vocally denied and the 2d and 3d generally defended as justifiable by those benefiting by them There is however almost no doubt that the first two destroy the independent and honorable business of vast numbers of honorable and competent business men Of course it is also said that the consumer is benefited by lower prices but such statements are not generally believed or found to be cor rect That illuminating oil goes up and crude goes down in price and dividends get larger is not an unusual experience The first three make or give the power to make all consumers pay tribute into the coffers of those whose will fixes the price as their interes dictates and the last two enable the unscrupulous to shear the lambsand if greatly successful in these various and devious ways are frequently looked upon as economically righteous 8 Effect or the danger threatened Judge Walton of the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine has pertinently observed that Men are mortal and their combinations short lived but corporations are immortal and their combinations and acquisitions may go on forever they may add field to field wealth to wealth and power to power till they become too strong for the government itself all experience shows that such accumu lations of wealth and power are dangerous to the public welfare1 Any person with no inclination to see imaginary dangers is nevertheless instinctively led or reluctantly driven to ask if we are approaching the condition of universal monopoly of which Fourier wrote nearly one hundredyears ago The organization of the commercial classes into federal companies or affiliated monopolies  will reduce the middle and laboring classes to a state of commercial vassalage  And we shall see the reappearance of feudalism Without in the least forgetting the value of corporate organiza tions and their necessity in our business life without denying there can be great benefit derived from the nationalization rather than the localization of our industries and admitting that concen tration of control and management may result in great savings in production and distributionand believing that if all these are hon estly and honorably done they may be made to promote the gen eral welfareyet if our diagnosis is correct the fact remains that the National Government does not the states cannot and the cor porations do control our industriesbut not in order to pro mote the general welfare As was said in the Addyston Steel Co case private contracts between such corporations may in truth I

the same character IV Power to control our commerce andcorporations 1 Ingeneral If the predicament we are in is due to unregulated commerce and the inadequate control of the corporations carrying it on we should get relief by proper regulation of both but the two are so related that attempts to regulate one without the other or for one govern ment to try to regulate the commerce and fortyfive different gov ernments undertake to regulate the corporations that carry it on will inevitably result in failure As we have seen the particular devices whereby evil is wrought or danger threatened are unjust discriminations in transportation predatory competition over capitalization and dishonest corporate managementthe first two are matters of commerce and the last two of corporation lawand though separable in the mind they are inextricably bound together in fact Nothing less than one system of regulation that can reach all can be successful Where is the power to do this 2 Power of the states As to the commerce which has become national in extent from what has already been said it is clear this is beyond the powers of the states first because the Constitution has taken away the power and second because if they had it it would be impossible to secure the necessary uniformity of regula tion to be efficient or desirable By the decisions a state cannot exclude a corporation engaged in interstate commerce2 nor tax such commerce3 even if the corpora tion is one of its own creation4 nor tax the agents engaged in it5 nor fix the rates for carrying it6 nor exclude articles of such com

regulating the corporations created by the states it would seem that a state could control its own corporations and exclude the foreign corporationbut the very corporation to be controlled is the one that carries on national commerceand this takes it out of any effective control at least when organized in another state But aside from these considerations many of the gteat corpora tions are so big and powerful as to make it practically impossible to secure adequate control if the legal authority existed The net earnings of the United States Steel Corporation for 1902 were over 133000000more than the total sum raised by taxation in New York and Ohio together in 1898 and twice the amount raised by tax in Pennsylvania the same year The gross income of the same corporation for 1902 565000000 was more than the total ordinary receipts of the National Government for any year prior to 1899 Its stock and bonds are more than the total capital engaged in manu facture in any state of the Union except New York and Pennsyl vania and likewise the same are greater than the value of all the farm products of any state except Illinois and Iowa If Judge Grosscup could have been induced to act as attorney for the North ern Securities Company in the Supreme Court and been successful in its defense the company could easily afford to pay him a fee the interest of which would bring him for life a greater return than his salary as a United States judge The only possible compet itor for a billion dollar trust is a hundred billion dollar State  But the diversity of the laws under which state

transaction occurs On such a question as to what duty there is and the extent of it to receive and transport safely freight from one state to another there are seven different views This is a sample of the variety of views upon many questions The corporate property and shares are usually subject to as many different methods of valuation and taxation as there are states in which they are located and in the case of intangible property and shares are not infrequently subject to double triple or quadruple taxation Reports and fees required and terms and conditions of the police control are as diverse as the places in which business is done Every session of the legislature in each of the fortyfive states and many of the decisions of the courts of last resort tend to increase rather than diminish the diversity Those who wish to engage in productive industry not of a purely local character and in an honorable way are inordinately inconvenienced and unduly hampered by the conflicting

1808 and hardly questioned since that Cong ress might establish an absolute embargo for an indefinite dura tion3 The raising of revenue by means of customs tariffs was at the time the Constitution was framed considered as much a method of regulating commerce as of obtaining a revenue and a protective tariff can be based upon no other constitutional provision than in order to promote the general welfare not by the revenue obtained but by the effect on commerce And this is the basis upon which it has been placed4 Under the tariff laws the importation of many proper articles of commerce have been excluded or prac tically prohibited by high duties Finally the constitutional con vention seemed to think the power to regulate foreign commerce would include the power to prohibit the slave

violation of the laws of the state where the attempt is made9 All the foregoing are so closely allied to a police power in the United States based on the commerce clause as to be practically indistinguishable from it and if as said above the commerce clause gives to the National Government the same power that a state government would have with the same constitutional provisions it would follow that any regulation made by Congress not merely for the purpose of evading other constitutional provisions would be beyond the authority of the courts to declare void The neces sity and wisdom of such a regulation are for Congress to determine While it may be questionable whether Congress could prohibit interstate commerce altogether although this was done during the Civil War as to the

consideration is what power has Congress to establish corporations to engage in interstate com merce Although by the Articles of Confederation Congress had no power except such as was expressly delegated to it yet within three months after these Articles went into effect the Congress of the Confederation approved a proposition to incorporate a national bank and Decem ber 311781 proceeded to institute and incorporate the Bank of North Americal The power to do this was hardly questioned Later in defense of the bank James Wilson in 1782 laid down the doctrine of implied constitutional powers in the following words  Whenever an object occurs to the direction of which no particular state is compet ent the management of it must of necessity belong to the United States in Congress assembled 2 In the Constitutional Convention of 1787Mr Madison twice moved that Congress have power To grant charters of corporations in cases where the public good may require them and the authority of a single state may be incompetent3 It was rejected partly because it was unnecessary4 and might lead to creation of monopolies5 Mr Wilson thought it necessary to pre vent a state from obstructing the general welfare and observed that mercantile monopolies are already included in the power to regu late trade6 Mr Gerry refused to sign the final report because among other things under the power over commerce monopo lies may be established7 In 1791 upon the recommendation of Mr Hamilton Congress chartered the Bank of the United States The constitutionality of the bill to establish it was attacked in the House of Representatives and President Washington after taking the written opinions of the AttorneyGeneral Randolph the Secre tary of State Jefferson both of whom opposed it and of the Secretary of the Treasury Hamilton signed the bill8 These opinions are classic on the subject of the implied powers of the government Among other things Hamilton argued 1 2 Kent Comm 254 1 Wilsons

government to regulate those objects and because it is incident to a general sovereign or legislative power to regulate a thing to employ all the means which relate to its regulation to the best and greatest advantage And further Suppose a new and unexplored branch of trade should present itself with some foreign country suppose it was man ifest that to undertake it with advantage required a union of capitals of a number of individuals    what reason can there be to doubt that the National Government would have a constitutional right to institute and incor porate such a company None They possess a general authority to regu late trade with foreign countries This is a means which has been practiced to that end by all the principal commercial nations who have trading com panies to this day which have subsisted for centuries   A power to regulate trade is a power to make all needful rules and regulations concern ing trade Why may it not then include that of erecting a trading company It is remarkable that the state conventions who had proposed amendments in relation to this point have most if not all of them expressed themselves nearly thus Congress shall not grant monopolies nor erect any company with exclusive advantages of commerce Thus at the same time expressing their sense that the power to erect trading companies or corpora tions was inherent in Congress and objecting to it no further than as to the grant of exclusive privileges2 Distinctions that are yet important were drawh as clearly in these great arguments as they ever have been since Mr Hamilton had argued that the establishment of a bank had a natural relation to the regulation of trade by creating a convenient and adequate medium of exchange to carry on commerce Mr Jefferson on this point said To erect a bank and to regulate commerce are very different acts He who erects a bank creates a subject of commerce in its bills so does he who makes a bushel of wheat or digs a dollar out of the mines yet neither of these persons regulates commerce thereby To make a thing which may be bought and sold is not to prescribe regulations for buying and selling Besides if this was an exercise of the power of regulating commerce it would be void as extending as much to the internal commerce of every state that is to say the commerce between citizen and citizen as to its external that is to say its commerce with another state or with foreign nations or with the Indian tribes3 This is the exact distinction made in the sugar trust case in 18954 The charter of the bank expired in 1811 when the

such power A constitutional amendment proposing to give to the National Government power to create a corporation or authorize a statecreated corporation for private business purposes to go into a state and against its consent to establish and operate a manufactur ing plant there I believe would and ought to be resented by every state But no such power or authority is needed If the govern ment can obtain control over the corporations that do the growing mining or making of things it will have ample power to solve our difficulties but if it cannot obtain this control in a way to exercise it directly and unequivocally then it is doubtful it the national arm is long and strong enough to extricate us from our perils As things now are the manufacturing companies do the trading the National Government has control of the trading but neither the manufacturing nor the company that does it if the process can be reversed so that the trading companyincorporated by the National Government will do the manufacturing then both the trading and the company doing it can be directly controlled and the manufac turing also incidentally so far as the regulation of commerce may make necessary It is believed this is enough and nothing else is The question is then can a National transmission transporta tion or trading company be authorized to engage ingrowing min ing or making thingsin the states if they do not object I think so 1 Because making or producing things is incidental or necessary to each of the other operations A railroad company would have the right to repair its cars and nearly every such com pany has extensive shops for repairing and constructing its cars and if they can construct for any purpose they can be given the right to sell at least outside the state 2 Such has been the practice already All the Pacific railroads were authorized to carry intra as well as interstate freight National banks do an ordinary private loan and discount business as well as issue notes the Union and Central Pacific charters permitted them to mine coal for their sup ply then in the territories but since in the states through which they pass the Maritime Canal Company is authorized to construct and operate a canal in a place where the United States has no jur isdiction 3 If the states can give authority to do such things away from home which by comity is sufficient for the company there seems to be no reason to think a federal corporation cannot 383MICHIGAN LAW RE VIEW be given the same power which will also be effective through the comity of the state where exercised 4 Now a federal corpora tion may be created in the District of Columbia or a territory to carry on a manufacturing business there such a corporation if its charter does not forbid may by comity engage in such manufacture in any state the same as a statecreated corporation the fact that the National Government also expressly authorized it to engage in interstate trade or transporation would not limit its power by com ity to carry on its manufacture wherever it was not forbidden 5 But the power to engage in trade or transportation necessarily implies the power to secure something to trade or transport the National Government may authorize such a company to acquire these things by contracts of purchase and sale in any state if a trading company can buy the things in which it deals there is no good reason why its charter may not allow it to make the thing it trades in if the state where it does this does not object So I believe that if the National Government can create a trading company the Nation in the charter and the states by comity can and will allow it to do manufacturing in any state There seems to be no direct authority on the matter but what there is leans that way Such intrastate business probably is and would be subject to state laws Taxing power The National Government also has at its com mand the taxing power if direct taxes are levied they must be apportioned according to population2 if indirect they need not be so3 but must be uniform throughout the country it can reach the property and transactions of all persons natural and artificial sub ject to the foregoing provisions and a few others not important in this connection The power to tax is the power to destroy as was said in McCulloch v Maryland4 and this power has been used by the National Government to produce a uniform currency by taxing out of existence the issues of the state banks in favor of the National banks and such a tax was held to be constitutional5 The conse quences of this

to be apportioned but is a tax or excise on a privilege business employment or occu pationl It perhaps would have to be uniform upon the same sub jects throughout the country A corporation formed by the National Government not only would be subject to the control of that government in many ways that it could not otherwise be but in addition might be made subject to a franchise fee or tax that need be neither uniform nor apportioned as direct taxes are Treaty making power It has been said that the National Govern  ment could not exclude an English manufacturing company from coming into any state that did not forbid it and there carrying on its manufacturing businessand hence the National Government could not reach such a condition Such certainly is a mistake Congress can forbid natural persons from entering the states for any purpose and it certainly has as complete power over alien corpora tions as over alien natural persons The right to exclude in this case is not based wholly on the commerce clausebut on the treaty making power also V Methods of control If our analysis has been correct the things to be controlled are interstate commerce and the corporations engaged therein as

power over such a cor poration and then only in naming the terms and conditions under which those acts may be performed The available methods of procedure are therefore three 1 State control of statecreated corporations or 2 State and National control of statecreated corporations or 3 National con trol of national corporationsengaged in national commerce interstate and foreign 1 As to the first as things now stand we have before seen the practical impossibility of success in this direction This is gen erally acknowledged on all sides It has therefore been proposed that the National Government relinquish by an act of Congress all power of control over the interstate commerce of manufacturing and trading companies to the states In the first place it is doubt ful if such an act would be constitutional The cases upon which such an idea is based are far from sustaining a general act relin quishing control over such commerce except in a few cases like selling intoxicating liquors2 or convict made goods and as the Court said It does not admit of argument that Congress can neither delegate its own powers nor enlarge those of a state such an act of Congress can be valid only in a case of a state law which could not operate upon articles occupying a certain situa tion until the passage of the act of Congress But again if Congress should do so and the relinquishment of its power was constitutional its operation throughout the country could or would not be uniformit must necessarily vary with the different statesand we would have substantially the conditions existing before the formation of the government under the constitu tionan infinite variety of annoying commercial obstructions Such a scheme also that left out regulating the railroads would not reach half the problem Still further it would be ineffective unless it forbade the sale of trust made goods in the case of a trading company or forbade individuals as well as corporations from sending such goods into the state otherwise the goods might be sold by the offending corporation to an individual purchaser in an adjoining state that did not forbid and he could sell them in the 1 State v Curtis 36 Conn 374 s In re Rahrer 140 U S 545 386NEED OF A NATIONAL INCORPORATION LA W 3 state objecting But still further if effective to the point of exclu sion it would result only in isolating that state from the others and enable its own industries to charge higher prices 2 As to the second method state and federal control of state created corporations It perhaps is necessary here to take an inven  tory of the arsenal at hand And first on the part of the state 1 It has entire control and jurisdiction over its own corporations and their actions 2 It has no control or jurisdiction of a corporation merely as a corporation formed in another statewhat it is or may do is for the state that creates it to determine 3 It has no con trol over the interstate commerce of such corporation 4 It has the power to control or fix the terms upon which a corporation created in another state may enter into the state and carry on busi ness there other than interstate commerce 5 All the states together could enact uniform corporation laws and uniform laws for the admission and control of foreign corporationsbut the probability of such a thing being done is an idle dream Second on the part of the National Government 1 It has power to control interstate commerce possibly to the extent of prohibiting it though in the case of a healthy commodity of trade a necessity to life it is doubtful if Congress could impress it with a perm anent condemnation so that it could not be exported out of one state into another 2 It can tax any one for the privilege of engag ing in interstate commerce if all are taxed uniformly good and bad alike 3 It has no jurisdiction over a statecreated corporation merely as such to prescribe what shall be its powers rights or privileges these are for the creating state to determine The National Government can reach it only through the taxing or com merce power The recent discussions have centered around the state and national anti trust acts and the interholdings of stocks by corpora tions actually engaged in interstate commerce and holding of the stocks in such corporations by other corporations not in any other way engaged in interstate commerce But they will arise in and have to be decided in connection with a telegraph companysay like the Western Union Telegraph Co a railroad company as in the Northern Securities Company a manufacturing company as the United States Steel Corporation and a trading corporation The antitrust act of the National Government provides  1 Mr Stimson Opinion to Indus Corn Rep Vol XIX p 705 387MICHIGAN LA W RE VIE W  1 Every contract combination in the form of trust or otherwise or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states or with foreign nations is hereby declared to be illegal Every person who shall make any such contract or engage in any such combination or con spiracy shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction thereof shall be punished etc  2 Every person who shall monopolize or attempt to monopolize or combine or conspire with any other person or persons to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several states or with foreign nations shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor etc1 The state acts differ somewhat from this but for the purpose of this discussion this may be taken as a fair sample of the general tenor of the state acts except that they relate to commerce within the individual statessome thirtytwo 2 of the states having anti trust acts of various degrees of stringency These acts make contracts and combinations of the kind named and monopolies whatever that may mean in the statute crimes which neither of them would be without the statute Without any statute such contracts and combinations in unreasonable restraint of trade were looked upon as ultra vires in the case of a corpora tion not expressly authorized to make such contracts to such extent that the state that created such offending corporation might by quo warranto proceedings forfeit its charter or enjoin carrying out such a contract3 Aside from this case of a corporation the state had no right to complain of contracts in restraint of tradeit could only refuse to enforce them in a suit between the offending parties and could not enjoin the parties from carrying them out if they were willing Some of the questions involved are raised in the two Northern Securities casesthe state case4 and the national case5 now both before the Supreme Court The first involves the states power and the second the National Governments power In the state case the question is whether certain acts in the way of organizing the Northern Securities Co incorporated in New Jersey and which exchanged its shares for the shares of a majority of the shareholders in the Great Northern Rail way Co incorpbrated in Minnesota and for the shares of a major ity of the shareholders in the Northern Pacific Railway Co incor 1 Act of July 2 1890 26 Stat at L 209 2 Indus

do not1 An appealhas been taken to the Supreme Court and argued but not yet decided If the decision of the lower court is sustained it will destroy any effective state control of interstate railways leaving no remedy in the state except a repeal of the charter if the right to repeal exists which we understand is not the case with the Great Northern or condemning the lines of the offending companies under the power of eminent domain2 and the state undertaking to operate them or turning them over to a company formed as the state shall direct Besides such a decision holding that such acts on the part of the organizers of the Northern Securities Company do not violate the Minnesota antitrust act will make the trusts acts of the other thirty or more states of no legal consequence in preventing such com binations of interstate railways such decision would seem also nec essary to substantially annul the national act as a method of regula tion If the decision of Judge Lochren is reversed on the ground that the act of organizing the Northern Securities Company and giving it through stock ownership the control of two parallel lines of rail way violates the anti  consolidation law as it seems to me the Court is likely to holdall states having such laws will have some authority over such lines within their state but this pushed to the last extremity only enables the state to prevent them from being operated within the state under one management and to be entirely effective would result in cutting the roads up into sections limited by the lines of such states as had or enforced such a law If the decision is reversed on the ground that the merger violates the state antitrust act then Minnesota and the other states having similar acts could enjoin the operation of such roads in their respec tive states by such offending company but this also at the last extremity could be enforced only by breaking such lines up into sections limited by state boundaries In both the foregoing cases the laws of Minnesota without being supplemented by the national law of a similar kind could not prevent the lines of these companies being operated together under the Northern Securities charter in an 1 Minnesota v Northern Securities Co 123 Fed 692 2 Erie and North East Railroad v Casey 26 Pa St 287 1856 People v OBrien 111 N Y 1 1888 389MICHIGAN LA W RE VIE W adjoining state that did not object Even if both companies were organized in Minnesota and the state could compel a surrender of the shares by the Northern Securities Company such a proceeding would not prevent the same persons incorporating in the adjoining state with the same amount of stock and turning it over to the Northern Securities Company vesting the management of the par allel lines in the adjoining states in that company In other words such remedies as the state might enforce if they had full power would be finally only to break continuous interstate railroads into state sections under separate companiesand then the remedy would be worse than the disease But if the decision is reversed on the ground that the state anti trust act was violated it would almost necessarily follow that the national antitrust act was violated also This is the question direct ly involved in the government case and the decision of Judge Thayer is to the effect that the merger was formed by a contract in restaint of trade or commerce among the several states1 substantially on the ground that the natural and inevitable tendency of the merger would be a restraint of such trade and that the parties must have contemplated and intended the natural consequences of their acts This decision has been severely criticised2 though under the evidence and facts that seem to have been brought out the court did not appear to go far astray in refusing to believe the men who formed the com pany were too dull or too stupid to comprehend the natural result of their acts This decision is now before the Supreme Court for con sideration and if sustained upon the principles laid down in the unani mous decision of the court below or upon the ground so clearly and so succinctly stated by Sir Frederick Pollock in a recent review3 will yet leave many unsolved problems such as will it apply to the case of the purchase outright of one railroad by another as was done by the two companies the Great

enough stock to control various railways or manufacturing companies primarily for investment and incident ally resulting in management No one of these questions can be completely answered by the decision of the government case for they are not involved they can be answered only after long con tinued litigation every step of which will be stubbornly contested It is more than doubtful that all or even most of these will be held to violate the antitrust act But suppose stockholding combi nations such as the Securities Co is is declared to be illegal Is it not certain that in some state a corporation similar to it will be formed its stock subscribed the money paid in and the sum used to buy outright the property of competing companies Will that be illegal To take the case of the Western Union Telegraph Co It was formed largely out of consolidations with and purchases outright of the stock or property or both of various other companies all perhaps lawful by the laws of the places where they occurred and were completed before the national act was enacted It has only a single competitor throughout the country of any consequence the Postal Telegraph Co It has been stated that these two com panies have such an understanding about rates as to violate the anti trust act but suppose they have not nevertheless the Western Union Telegraph Co is and has been one of the most complete monopolies in the country using that word in its popular signifi cance as expressing the condition of things that is deemed men acing It is more than doubtful that the purchase outright of the property of one company by a competing company would be within either provision of the national act1 and if itwasheld to be it is more than likely the act would be unconstitutional Suppose the Postal Telegraph Company should fail wind up its affairs tear down its poles and go out of businessthen the Western Union Company would become the sole seller of telegraphic communication Would the

became the sole trader because his competitors went out of business without his having anything to do with it It is apprehended not no one certainly could be punished for the legal acts of another done without participation by the former Yet in sober fact would not the monopoly be greater and the effects worse and is not this the thing that is really fearedthe unregulated big thingthe thing that has because of its size extent of operation and interest the power to do harm if not harnessed And what is here said of the telegraph company applies to railroad trading or manufacturing as well Most people are more afraid of one uncaged lion than of a thousand properly cagedand the danger is vastly greater The road to regulation through antitrust anticontractinrestraint of trade and antimonopoly acts is long uncertain inefficient and inadequate in the endand may destroy the very thing which if properly regulated is desirable or necessary for the welfare of all But suppose all these were held to be within the act as it now stands or one that might be made What would be the result The vast bulk of our business would be under the ban of illegality and have to be reorganized How Under the same state corporation laws as before or as they might be amended to meet the changed conditions Has any one any reason to believe the new regime would be better than the present Would

power Can anything less than marking a limit as to size or strict regulation otherwise be effective No state can fix a limit of size except for its own corporations and no state can fully and completely regulate any but its own corporations Never can or will the action of all the states be uniform in these particulars As has been said before the thing to be regulated is the big thing the

3 7he third method A national incorporation law No power or authority to do these in the proper and uniform way resides any where except in the National Government The government of course could act either by prescribing the conditions under which corporations to engage in interstate commerce might be formed by the states and forbid others from carrying on such commerce or might itself provide for the formation of corporations to carry on the interstate commerce of the country In the former case in every particular except what the government prescribed there would be variation among the states that would breed differences conflicts and litigation and besides the state alone would have direct and positive authority over the corporations it created Of what possible advantage could this be except to retain certain tax ing privileges many of them unjust or to retain litigation within the state courts But if the foregoing enumerated things are nec essary to be regulated in order to give relief from the ills we suffer the conditions necessary to prescribe would be so nearly equivalent to passing an incorporation act by the government itselfwithout retaining control over the creature created that it seems to me it would be much wiser to enact a national incorporation law in such a manner as to give the National Government unequivocally the ordinary powers of complete control that any state has over its own corporations That such an act will in the future after we have tried and failed in every other way be the only simple and adequate remedy is generally admitted by several who have closely studied the mat ter1 yet nearly all shrink from advocating it because of various imaginary dangers some of which may be enumerated 1 Enor mous centralization of our

objections as strongly as any I have seen The notion of state rights what remains of it would be riddled Ninety per cent of the business of the people would be taken from the control of their own states and their own courts and put under the control of the 1 Indus Com R Vol XIX p 645 Mr Stimsons Opinion as Advisory Counsel to the Commission Vol XIX p 711 Mr Huffcut Statement to Commission Vol XIX p 722 393MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW federal government For in regulating these federal corporations Congress would control not only their relations with sellers and buyers with their creditors and stockholders but with the labor they employed national eight hour laws would become possible without constitutional amendment2 To these something in the way of answer may be suggested 1 There is no concentration of powerall that is to be exercised now exists in the National Government there is therefore no shift ing of the balance of powers 2 It has become apparent that the state governments are unequal to the taskbecausethey have not and never since the Constitution have had the power Because they can not exercise the power shall the National Government refuse to exercise it when the occasion demands and when it was conferred upon that government to be exercised in order to promote the general welfare as much as any other power 3 But all the civil rights that are to be so seriously affected we now hold and always have held under the same possibility of being limited expanded and controlled for the benefit of all when occasion demanded 4 But also it is we the people that con trol in the Federal Union as well as in the states The National Gov ernment was created to do for the benefit of all what the states could not do within the terms of the Constitution 5 The burdening of the courts might occur temporarily but not likely to any great extent Complexity diversity conflict uncertainty beget litiga tion Simplicity uniformity and certainty have the reverse effect But even if otherwise the creation of the necessary courts is not often made a plea for refusing to relieve a threatening condition of national extent and operation 6 Such or similar dire results were predicted from the establishment of National banks but they proved to be imaginary and not real There seems to be but one supreme legal test involved in this methodand that is could the National Government if it found it necessary or desirable classify corporations according to their size and extent of operation and require if found necessary all above a certain size to forego the privilege of engaging in interstate com merce or tax them so it would be unprofitable unless they organize under a national act We believe this question will be answered in the affirmative The rest would depend on the wis dom of Congress 1 This is what Mr Jefferson argued was the design of the Commerce clause See quota tion given above from him 9 Opinion to Indus Corn Vol XIX p 700 394NEED OF A

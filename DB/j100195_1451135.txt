of the Hebrew and Samaritan MSS in the British Museum Part II London I905 4to Pp 8492 and Io Plates A LIBRARY without a printed catalogue resembles a locked treasure chamber to which the keys are wanting The more valuable and extensive the stores of this library are and the more scholars are compelled to resort to its treasures the more keenly is the deficiency in point of accessibility felt The British Museum since the acquisition of the Almanzi collection and through the purchase of numerous codices from the Orient particularly from Yemen can easily claim first rank among possessors of Hebrew MSS Up to the present however these treasures could not be taken advan tage of in full measure for the simple reason that a catalogue was lacking Mr Margoliouths Descriptive List was designed to supply this deficiency but it was after all only a temporary remedy and by no means did away with the need of a full descriptive cata logue of the various MSS Mr Margoliouths present catalogue solves the problem completely It is an excellent work a fine example of bibliographical scholarship and deserves a place among the best works of this kind The copiousness and the exactness dis played in the description of the codices and the number range and reliability of the references will earn the author the warm thanks of all scholars We propose to present in the following a short description of the various sections of the work and to add occasionally some supple mentary details to the authors remarks Especially in those cases where the author has expressed his uncertainty concerning proper names by means of a question mark or has not transcribed them we shall attempt here and there to supply the deficiency The volume embodies the following chapters I Midrash and Mid rashic Discourses Nos 34097 pp 150 II Talmud and Halakhah Nos 398604 pp 51196 III Liturgies Nos 605732 pp 197487 The MSS enumerated in Chapter I are mostly from Yemen Worthy of particular notice is Add 27I69

this is the right place for AnatolisL DNlnnln qnn Nos 3767 it seems to me that it would have been more properly inserted under the heading Philosophy Interesting is also the collection of Arabic

particular attention they were first made known by Poznaaski in SteinschneiderFestschrift pp 195218 III The collection of liturgies is the most important of those described in the present volume in mere extent it occupies more than half of the space of the volume In the case of a great number of these codices I had the opportunity of convincing myself of the thoroughness of the descriptions by means of personal examination Mr Margoliouths notices have been written with great care and with detailed knowledge of the subject I must say however that in my opinion the method generally adopted in the description of Mahzor MSS should be totally different The initial verses and the names of the authors of the various Piyutim which are all that are in most cases given are not the only data of importance and exhibit in no wise that which is peculiar and characteristic to a ritus Of much greater significance are in many cases the superscriptions and the various rules given for liturgical use and application c which however are here often passed by Likewise in the case of Selihot the decisive point is not to be found in the poetical pieces but much ratherwhere one would least expect to find itin the Biblical verses and in the prose pieces which however are as a rule not noted Likewise the usual prayers which are here dispatched with the short remark Common Prayers contain much that is406 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW characteristic and significant This of course is not said by way of criticism of the author it is merely the utterance of a general wish for a detailed exposition and discussion of which however this is not the place Just as little is he to be criticized for not having always given the acrostics which in many cases can be very readily extracted from the various pieces this as a matter of fact has often been done The catalogue as it lies before us is a very useful means for the purpose of obtaining general information and is very easy to be handled The constant references to the various literaryhistorical authorities in particular to Zunzs Literaturgesch d synag Poesie enhance its value decidedly In the liturgical collection of the British Museum all the rites are represented The catalogue presents the following divisions A The Haggadah Nos 60512 pp 197205 B Siddur of Amram Gaon Nos 613I4 p 206 0 Italian Rite Nos 61548 pp 207 62 D

Karaite Ritual Nos 72432 pp 45087 The order of the codices in the catalogue is as follows the Siddur comes first the Mahzor follows and the list concludes with an enumeration of collections of special pieces of particular prayers or commentaries One or more repre sentative codices are placed at the head of their respective sections or subsections and the MSS that follow are whenever needful com pared with these standard types Among the particularly note worthy codices there may be mentioned the Vitry Mahzor No 655 which served as basis for our not very successful edition likewise the MSS of the old French rite which are quite rare Nos 663 sq 677 The Yemen Mahzor has already been made the theme of a comprehensive study by the author himself JQR XVII 69o7II I may be permitted to subjoin some complementary details To A Almost all of these beautifully illustrated Haggadahs seem to have come from the Provence the type of the miniatures points to the Provence as the place of their origin cf Rivista Israelitica I I55 and the peculiarities of the handwriting and of the rite itself confirm this view The family Shealtiel Hen which Cod 606 names as owner is likewise a Provencal family cf Ozar Nehmad II 229 sq for No 605 cf also Zunz Ritus p 46 It appears that the French Provengal type of miniature was regarded as exemplary Italian MSS as late as the time of the high Renaissance still

numbers of the present catalogue then on p 492 by a short list of Addenda et Corrigenda The volume closes with ten photographic plates which have been chosen partly with the intention of showing the style occasionally employed in the ornamentation of Mediaeval Hebrew MSS Our knowledge in the field of Hebrew Palaeography is still in its rudiments and these beautiful and finely executed plates will be a very welcome contribution One slight defect may here be noted Within the book itself in the case of references to other MSS the old pressmark of the MS instead of the catalogue pagenumber is given which makes the work of consulting and looking up very slow and tedious This should be avoided in the third volume Our ardent wish is that this will soon appear and worthily conclude this monumental work for which all students will be deeply grateful to the author He has already earned their thanks and esteem I ELBOGEN BERLIN January I906

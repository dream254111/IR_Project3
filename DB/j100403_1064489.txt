insulting con duct on the part of the defendant while making the search should be taken into consideration in fixing the damages Although it is not a question touched upon in the instant case it is to be noted that in an action for unlawful search it is no defense to say that the plaintiff was a thief or did in fact have the stolen property upon his premises or person The doctrine or rule of probable cause has no application unless in mitigation of exemplary damages McClurg v Brenton 123 Iowa 368 98 N W 881 101 Am St Rep 323 65 L R A 519 Nor does the fact that the accused in order to

corporation lessees of a building for a term of years entered into an oral agreement with the lessors whereby they the lessees should move out while the leased building was being de stroyed and a new

ment of possession by the tenant and the resumption of possession by the landlord i e by operation of law is excluded from the general operation of the statute of frauds and is therefore valid Lamar v Mc Nanee 10 Gill  J Md 116 32 Am Dec 152 Boyd v Gore 143 Wis 531 128 N W 68 21 Ann Cas 1263 This rule also obtains in Eng land See Nickells v Atherstone 10 Q B 944 59 E C L 943 16 L J Q B 371 11 Jur

possession to the landlord is inopera tive under the provisions of the statute Lammott v Gist 2 Har  G Md 433 18 Am Dec 295 See Armory v Kannoffsky 117 Mass 351 19 Am Rep 416 Though the elements of a surrender by operation of law be lacking yet where one party has been induced to make expenditures upon land or otherwise to change his situation materially in reliance upon the performance of an oral agreement the other party is held by force of his acts declarations or silent acquiescence which have misled the other to his harm to be estopped from setting up the statute of frauds Fenner v Blake

SEDISPARAGEMENT OF QUALITYThe defendant who conducted a meat market opposite that of the plaintiff said to a purchaser of meats from the plaintiff That meat you are buying is diseased rotten and tubercular To another person a meat dealer the defendant declared that all the plaintiffs meat was bad that his whole store was full of tuberculosis and that his meat was rotten The plaintiff brought an action for slander alleging no special damage Held the words are slanderous per se Panster v Wasserman 180 N Y Supp 718 In general averment and proof of special damage is essential to the maintenance of an action for slander of a person unless the charge is of so grave a character that special damage will be presumed Stud dard v Trucks 31 Ark 726 Doyle v Kirby 184 Mass 409 68 N E 843 But when the words spoken have such a relation to the profession oc cupation trade or calling of the plaintiff that they directly tend to in jure him therein they are actionable per se and special damage need not be alleged and proved See Blumhardt v Rohr 70 Md 328 17 Atl 266 Singer v Bender 64 Wis 169 24 N W 903 But if the words are not published concerning the trader or manu facturer in his occupation or calling but concerning the quality of the goods he makes or deals in special damage must be shown Swan v Tappan 5 Cush Mass 104 Cleveland Leader Printing Co v Nether 601

j101009,The Virginia Law Register,1097730,The Court of Appeals,i245842,1897 CORRESPONDENCE 617 CORRESPONDENOE THE COURT OF APPEALS Editor Virginia Law Register In the November number of the REGISTER Mr Harris makes some valuable suggestions in regard to a change in the terms of the Court of Appeals Pardon me for mentioning one case out of a large number to show the extent to which delays are possible under the present system A cause in chancery was heard upon a demurrer to the bill in May 1895 The demurrer was sustained An appeal was immediately taken and the case was ready for hearing at the June term of the Court of Appeals at Wytheville with the single exception that one of the parties had not had sufficient notice At the June term 1896 the case was not reached on the docket and a hearing was not had until the June term 1897 when the decision of the lower court was reversed and the complainants allowed to proceed with their suit but after two years un necessary delay Such delays are very discouraging to litigants The court should remain at Wytheville if there is to be a Summer session and there should be two terms a year at both Staunton and Wytheville But wherever it shall be deemed best for the court to sit the Valley and Southwest should certainly be given two annual terms SOUTHWJET THE LESSER SEAL OF STATE Editor Virqinia Law Reqister I beg to call attention to what appears to be a curious oversight though it may have been noted long ago and no steps taken to remedy it In glancing through the Virginia Code recently my eye fell on chapter V relat ing to the seals and flag of the Commonwealth Section 32 provides that on the obverse of the great seal shall be  Virtus     resting on a spear in her left hand and holding a sword in her right hand etc Section 33 makes the ob verse of the great seal the design for the lesser seal Having my notarial commission at hand with the lesser seal affixed I examined it and was a little surprised to find that on it Virtus rested on the spear held in her right hand and held the sword in her left This seems to be rather a remark able variance in a State seal The same error appears in the illustrated cut of the seal on the title page of the Code of 1887 WILLIAMS T DAVIS Petersburg Va DELINQUENT LANDS Editor Virginia Law Register The decision of our Supreme Court rendered in Thomas v Jones at Wytheville in July last seems to be attracting the attention of the profession and well it may I do not propose to discuss the opinion as that has been done by the editor and Mr Jack on Guy in the November number but I do wish to point out that the law as it now stands under this decision offers a favorable opportunity for the

DATED DECEMB 28TH 1683 CONCERN ING SCALES WITHIN THE MOUTH THE SCALY CHILD THAT WAS SHEWN THE ANATOMY OF THE SLINE WITHIN THE GUTS AND THE USE THEREOF IN MY LETTER OF THE 17TH SEPTEMBER 1683 I SAID THAT OUR SKIN WAS COVERED WITH SCALES I HAVE SINCE THAT TIME EXAMINED THE CUTICULA OF THE INSIDE OF THE MOUTH AND CHIEFLY THAT OF THE UNDER LIP WHICH I FIND TO BE CO VERED WITH SCALES GREATER AND BROADER THAN THOSE UPON THE BODY BUT THEY ARE WITHAL THINNER FIG 1 IS A SCALE WHICH I CHOOSE OUT AS ONE OF THE PERFECTEST AND MOST IN TIRE THESE SCALES HAD MORE LINES OR STREAKS RUNNING O VER THEM THAN THE SCALES HAD WHICH GREW ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BODY THE LINES I TAKE TO BE CHANNELS OR REMAIN DERS OF VAPOURS BREATHED THRO THE SKIN EVERY SCALE AL SO HAD A GREAT MANY SMALL GLOBULES UPON IT VERY TRAN SPARENT AS IS TO BE SEEN IN THE FIGURE ANOTHER SCALE LYING THEREBY HAD ITS CIRCUMFERENCE AS FIG 2 BUT AS THE SCALES OF OUR BODY LYING OVER ONE ANOTHER SO AS TO BE THREE DEEP ARE THE CAUSE OF THE SKINS APPEARING WHITE AS I HAVE FORMERLY SAID FOR DIAPHA NOUS PARTICLES LAID UPON ONE ANOTHER AND NOT TOO CLOSE MAKE A WHITE FOR WHICH REASON WE SEE THAT PAPER SPIT TLE BEATENGLASS AND SNOW ARE WHITE SO THE SCALES OF OUR MOUTH FOR AS MUCH AS I CAN YET FIND LYING BUT A LITTLE OVER THE SIDES OF ONE ANOTHER SUFFER THE REDNESS OF THE FLESH AND BLOOD TO APPEAR THROUGH THEM AND FOR THIS CAUSE THE LIPS AND MOUTH ARE RED I HAVE OFTEN WONDRED WHAT SHOULD BE THE CAUSE THAT A SINGLE HAIR LYING UPON THE SKIN CAUSED SO GREAT A TICKLING BUT IF THE SKIN BE COVERED WITH SCALES AND THE OUTWARD BARK OF THE HAIR BE VERY RUGGED IT WILL NOT BE STRANGE587 STRANGE THAT A HAIR LYING OVER THE EDGES OF ONE OR MORE SCALES SHOULD CAUSE A MOTION IN THEM WHICH BEING COM MUNICATED TO THE SKIN MAY CAUSE THAT SENSATION THERE HAS BEEN CARRYED THRO THIS LAND TO BE SHOWD A CHILD ABOUT TEN YEARS OLD WHOSE BODY AS THEY SAID WAS ALL COVERED WITH FISH SCALES HAVING HEARD VERY MUCH OF THIS WONDER I WENT TO SEE IT BUT FOUND IT MUCH DIFFERENT FROM THE REPORT OF IT FOR THERE APPEARED TO MY NAKED EYE AND MICROSCOPE NO PART OF THE BODY WHICH I COULD SAY WAS COVERED WITH FISH SCALES BUT RA THER WITH A THICK CALLUS AND MORE ESPECIALLY WITHIN THE HANDS AND UNDER THE FEET UPON SOME PARTS OF THE BODY ALSO THERE WERE EXCRESCENCIES LIKE RIDGES OF WARTS I DESIRED OF THOSE THAT TOOK CARE OF THE CHILDTHAT I MIGHT HAVE ONE OF THE PARTICLES OR SCALES PLUCKT FROM THE BO DY BUT THEY REFUSED ME UNDER PRETENCE THAT THE BLOOD WOULD FOLLOW IT WHEN I LOOKT EARNESTLY UPON THE CHILD I PERCEIVED THEY WERE DISPLEASED WITH ME THEY TOLD ME THAT THE SCALES FELL OFF FOUR TIMES A YEAR AND OTHERS GREW IN THEIR PLACES AND THAT DAILY SOME OF THE SCALES WERE LEFT IN THE BED BUT THEY STILL REFUSED TO GIVE ME OR SELL ME ANY OF THEM AT LENGTH IN SEARCHING CAREFULLY ABOUT THE ROOM I FOUND A CLUSTER WHICH MY REPEATED OBSERVATIONS DO CONFIRM TO BE NOTHING BUT NATURAL AND ORDINARY SCALES SUCH AS BODIES USE TO BE COVERED WITH I AFTERWARDS PUT IT IN WATER AND LET IT LYE SOME HOURS TILL THE PARTS WOULD SEPARATE WITH THE LEAST TOUCH INTO A THOUSAND SMALL SCALES THESE WERE MORE THEN ORDINA RILY BESET WITH GLOBULES AND THEREBY WERE VERY LIKE THE SCALES OF THE BRAWN OF THE INSIDE OF THE HAND BUT NO OTHERWISE REMARQUABLE I HAVE BEEN A LONG TIME DESIROUS TO EXAMINE THE SLIMY MATTER WHICH LINES THE INSIDE OF THE GUTS AND SO MUCH THE RATHER BECAUSE IT IS GENERALLY ESTEEMED AS A SUPERFLU OUS PART AND FIT TO BE REMOVED WHEREAS ON THE CONTRA RY IT APPEARS TO ME TO BE A PART INSTRUMENTAL AND NE CESSARY588 CESSARY FOR THE USES OF THE BOWELS I TOOK THEN THIS WOOLLY SUBSTANCE AND HAVING CLEARED IT FROM THE EXCRE MENT AS MUCH AS I COULD I FOUND A GREAT NUMBER OF VERY THIN BLOOD VESSELS BRANCHED OUT AND LYING SO THICK TOGETHER THAT THE SPACE OF HALF THE DIAMETER OF A HAIR WAS NOT VOID BETWEEN THE BRANCHES BESIDES THE BLOODVESSELS THERE WERE ALSO OTHER VESSELS THAT HAD NO DISTINGUISHABLE COLOUR WHICH I SUSPECTED TO BE LIMPHA TICKS OR LACTEALS I COULD NOT DISCERN ANY MEMBRANE THAT ENCOMPASSED THEM BUT ALL ABOUT THEM LAY A GLUTI NOUS CLEAR SLIME BESET WITH SMALL GLOBULES WHICH SLIME AND GLOBULES I TOOK TO BE THE EXCREMENTS LYING UPON THE GUTS BUT WHEN I WENT TO SCRAPE GENTLY THIS SLIME AWAY I FOUND THAT I NOT ONLY WOUNDED THE BLOODVESSELS BUT TORE AWAY MANY BLOODVESSELS AND OTHER VESSELS TOGE THER THESE BLOODVESSELS DO NOT SPREAD THEIR BRANCHES ON ALL SIDES LIKE THE BLOODVESSELS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY BUT AS THEY LYE IN A BOW SEND ALL THEIR BRANCHES INWARD AND NONE OUTWARDS THEY ALSO LYE SO CLOSE BY ONE ANO THER THAT I IMAGINE TEN THOUSAND OF THEM MAY BE IN THE SPACE OF AN INCH SQUARE I HAVE DESCRIBED THE CIR CUMFERENCE OF ONE OF THESE VESSELS IN FIG 3 A B C D E F G WHICH CIRCUMFERENCE IS NO GREATER THEN TO BE COVER ED WITH A SAND THE THICKNESS OR DIAMETER IS ABOUT THE 25TH PART OF A HAIR OF MY HEAD FROM THE INSIDE MANY SMALL VESSELS ISSUING OUT DOE AS IT WERE JOYN TOGETHER BUT OF THESE ONLY 4 ARE SPECIFIED AS IN FIG 3 B L E AND C L F FIG 4 H I K IS A SMALL VESSEL AND THOUGH I HAVE PLACED IT AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE FORMER NEVERTHELESS IT WAS PARTLY COVERED BY IT AS IS USUAL WITH THE REST OF THEM TO COVER ONE ANOTHER THE BOWS ALSO LYE ALL THE SAME WAY BENDING TOWARDS THE PASSAGE OF THE EXCREMENT OUT OF THE GUTS I COULD NOT TRACK H G AND H K ANY FURTHER BY REASON589 REASON THAT THEY HID THEMSELVES AMONG THE OTHER PARTS OF THE WOOLLY SUBSTANCES FROM THE FOREGOING OBSERVATION I HAVE BEEN DOUBT FUL WHETHER THE ARTERIES AND VEINS WERE NOT IN THIS PLACE JONED TOGETHER VIZ WHETHER A WERE NOT AN ARTERY AND G A VEIN FOR AMONG ALL THE EXPERIENCE THAT I HAVE HAD OF THE BLOODVESSELS I NEVER PERCEIVED SUCH A PROBABILI TY OF AN ANASTOMOSIS FOR IN OTHER PACES THE ARTERIES BEING VARIOUSLY DISSEMINATED FOR THE NOURISHMENT OF THE PARTS THE VEINS ARE SO LIKEWISE FOR THE CARRYING THE BLOOD BACK AGAIN INTO THE HEART BUT IN THIS PLACE THE ARTERIES GOING NO FURTHER THAN THE HOLLOW OF THE GUTS SEEM TO HAVE NO OTHER BUSINESS THEN TO EMPTY THEMSELVES INTO THE VEINS THESE OBSERVATIONS ALSO MAKE ME MORE THEN EVER RE JECT THE OPINION THAT THE EXTREMITIES OF THE LACTEAL AND LIMPHATICK VESSELS HAVE MOUTHS OR OPENINGS WHEREBY THEY RECEIVE AND TAKE IN THE CHYLE OUT OF THE GUTS FOR I AM PER SWADED THAT THE EXTREMITIES OF THE LACTEAE IN THE GUTS ARE AS WELLCOVERED WITH THEIRCOAT ORMEMBRANE IN THAT PLACE AS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY WHICH NEVERTHELESS WILL NOT HINDER THE FOOD FROM PASSING OUT OF THE GUTS FOR LET FIG 5 A B C D E BE THE ROOT OF A TREE THE NOURISH MENT THAT THIS ROOT RECEIVES OUT OF THE EARTH SHALL PASS NO EASIER THRO THE EXTREMITIES A AND E THAN THRO ANY OTHER PLACE ABOUT D OR C WHICH IS OF THE SAME BIGNESS FOR EXAMPLE I HAVE SEEN THE SMALL ROOTS OF A VINE AN HUN DRED TIMES THINNER THAN AN HAIR OF MY HEAD THEIR FAR THER ENDS A AND E TAKE UP A PLACE OF THE ONE THOUSAND PART OF THE BIGNESS OF A SAND NOW IF A PLACE BE NO BIGGER THAN THIS THE MOISTURE OR NOURISHMENT OF THE TREE WILL AS WELL PASS THRO ANY PART OF THE BARK OR WOOD OF THE ROOT AS THRO THE PLACES A E SO THAT A THIN CAPILLARY ROOT MAY AS WELL RECEIVE THE NOURISHMENT AT ANY OTHER PLACE AS AT THE END AND AS THE ARTERIES WHOSE COATS ARE MADE UP OF A THREDDY SUBSTANCE CAN STRAIN THE BLOOD THRO THEM AS590 AS I HAVE FORMERLY SAID SO THE NUTRITIVE JUICE ALSO MAY PASS THRO THE THREDDY COATS OF THE BLOOD WATER AND MILK VESSELS AND IN THE SAME MANNER THE SMALL BRANCHES OF THE VEINS MAY TAKE UP SUBSTANCES OUT OF THE BOWELS AND CARRY THEM TO THE HEART THIS WILL NOT SEEM STRANGE WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT IF A MILKWATER OR BLOODVESSEL BE A THOUSAND TIMES LESS THAN A HAIR OF ONES HEAD THE COATS OF THEM MUST NEEDS BE VERY THIN AND THE THREDS WHEREOF THE COATS ARE MADE YET THINNER HOW EASY MUST MOISTURE PASS THRO THE SIDES OF SUCH VESSELS ESPECIALLY WHEN THE MATTER WHICH IS TO ENTER INTO THE VESSELS IS THINNER THAN THAT WHICH IS ALREA DY CONTAINED IN THEM IT HAS BEEN OBJECTED THAT WHILE THE PASSAGE INTO THE VESSELS IS SO OPEN A QUANTITY OF AIR AND WIND MAY ALSO GET INTO THEM NOW THAT YOU MAY SEE HOW THAT THE MOISTURE MAY PASS OUT OF THE BOWELS INTO THE VEINS AND THE WIND NOT PASS I MADE THIS FOLLOWING TRYAL I TOOK AN OX BLADDER BLEW IT UP AND LET IT DRY AS FIGURE 6 A B C D I THEN TOOK A PIECE OF A HOGS GUT MADE CLEAN ABOUT THE LENGTH OF A SPAN AND TIED IT UP AT E THEN I PUT INTO IT WATER TILL THE GUT WAS ABOUT A QUARTER FULL AFTERWARDS I FORCED IN THREE QUARTERS MORE OF AIR BINDING IT FAST AT F THE GUT THEN LAY UPON THE BLADDER AS E F I THEN HUNG THEM IN A CH MNEY WHERE WAS MADE BUT LITTLE FIRE AND I FOUND THAT THE WATER IN THE GUT DID NOT ONLY MOISTEN THE BLADDER WHERE IT TOUCHED IT BUT RUN DOWN IN TWO CHANNELS BY THE SIDE OF THE BLADDER IN THE SPACE OF SIXTEEN HOURS ALL THE MOISTURE IN THE GUT WAS RUN OUT WITHOUT THE LEAST AIR NAY THE GUT SEEMED AS STIFF AS WHEN IT WAS FIRST BLOWN LET US NOW COMPARE THE GUTS TO THE BLADDER AND THE CHYLE AND WIND IN THE GUTS TO THE WIND AND WATER IN THE HOGS GUT THEN SHALL THE GUTS LET THE MOISTURE PASS THROUGH THEM BUT NOT THE AIR AMONG THE AFORESAID BLOODVESSELS AND OTHER VESSELS LYING591 LYING WITHIN THE GUTS I SAW A MATTER SEEMING FIRST TO CON SIST OF GLOBULES AFTERWARDS IT APPEARED LIKE LITTLE GUTS WITHIN THE GREAT GUTS AT LENGTH IT PROVED TO BE SHORT THREDS WHOSE ONE END WAS PARTLY COVERED WITH THE AFORE SAID VESSELS AND THE OTHER END WAS FASTNED TO A SKIN OR MEMBRANE PROBABLY THE SAME WITH THAT CALLED BY THE ANATOMISTS THE INNERMOST COAT OF THE BOWELS FIG 7 A B C ARE THE ENDS OF THE THREDDY SUBSTANCE OTHERWISE CALLED THE SLIME OR WOOLLY SUBSTANCE WHICH I SHALL NOW NAME THE INNERMOST MUSCLE OF THE BOWELS THEIR APPEARANCE IF THE BLOODVESSELS BE REMOVED IS AS IN THE FIGURE THE THREDS MAKING THE INWARD MUSCLE OF THE BOWELS IF THEY BE LOOKT ON ON ONE SIDE ARE AS A D E C THE THICKNESS OF THESE THREDS IS LESS THAN A HAIR OF MY HEAD THEY ARE VERY TENDER AND BREAK UPON THE LEAST TOUCH I HAVE SOMETIMES THOUGHT THAT EACH OF THESE THREDS CONSISTED OF SEVERAL THREDS JOYNED TOGETHER OR THAT EVERY THRED HAD A MEMBRANE FOR ALL OF THEM SEEM TO BE VERY CLOSE LINKED TOGETHER THIS WOOLLY SUBSTANCE WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED I CON CEIVE MAY BE OF GREAT USE FOR THE THREDS MUST BE LONGER AND LYE CLOSER TOGETHER AND HAVE LITTLE MOISTURE BETWIXT THEM WHILST THE GUT IS EMPTY AND CRUMPLED BUT WHEN THE GUT IS FULL AND DISTENDED WITH VICTUALS THE THREDS MUST BE SHORTER AND LYE NOT SO CLOSE TOGETHER AS WHEN THE GUT IS CONTRACTED BY WHICH MEANS THE BLOODVESSELS LACTEALS AND LYMPHATICKS COME MORE EASIE TO RECEIVE THEIR LIQUORS INTO THEM FOR EXAMPLE LET US IMAGINE THAT IN THE FIG 8 A B C IS A GUT CUT ACROSS AS IT IS EMPTY AND SHRUNK THAT A D ARE THE THREDS MAKING THE INNERMOST MUSCLE OF THE GUT NOW IF THE GUT BE FULL AND STRETCHED TO THE WIDENESS OF E F G THE THREDS A D WILL BE CONTRACTED AS E H NOT ONLY BE CAUSE THEY ARE CLOSE COMPACTED TOGETHER AS THEY LYE A MONG ONE ANOTHER BUT ALSO BECAUSE THE BLOODVESSELS AND OTHER VESSELS RUNNING BETWEEN THEM KEEP THEM AS B IT592 IT WERE BOUND UP FOR IT THEY WERE SEPARATED FROM ONE ANOTHER THEN WOULD THE GROSSER PARTS OF THE EXCREMENTS GET AMONG THEM AS OFTEN AS THE BOWELS ARE EXTENDED NOW THE THREDS NOT BEING CROWDED SO MUCH WHEN THE GUTS ARE STRETCHED THE CHYLE ENTERS MORE EASILY INTO THE VESSELS LYING AMONG THEMAND AFTERWARDS UPON EVERY CONTRACTI ON OF THE GUTS BECAUSE THEN THE THREDS ARE SQUEEZED TO GETHER IS CONVEYED INTO THE BODY I SAID BEFORE THAT THE THREDS WHICH MAKE THE INNER MOST MUSCLE OF THE LOWELS LYE WITH THEIR ONE END IN THE HOLLOW OF THE BOWELS WHICH END IS FOR THE MOST PART COVERED WITH BLOODVESSELS AND OTHER VESSELS THEIR OTHER END IS FASTENED TO A SKIN OR MEMBRANE WHICH PROBABLY IS TAKEN BY ANATOMISTS FOR THE INNERMOST COAT OF THE BOWELS AS IN THE LINE D E FIG 7 MAY BE SEEN IN THIS MEMBRANE I DISCOVERED MANY GLO BULES OF FAT WHICH IN SOME PLACES LAY CLOSE AND CROW DED TOGETHER AND THEREFORE APPEARED IN DIFFERENT SHAPES IN OTHER PLACES LAY SOME FAT PARTICLES AT A DISTANCE FROM THE REST THESE ALL INCLINED TO AN OVAL SHAPE AS FIG 9 IN ANOTHER PLACE A LITTLE DISTANT LAY OVALLISH PARTICLES IN A RIGHT LINE AS FIG 10 IN ANOTHER PLACE THE PARTICLES LAY SO THICK TOGETHER THAT THEY CROWDED ONE ANOTHER AND APPEARED AS IN FIG II

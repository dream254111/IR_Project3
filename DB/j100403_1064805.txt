J100403,VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW,1064805,DOES THE WRITING OF WORDS OF REVOCATION ACROSS THE FACE OF A WILL CONSTITUTE SUCH A CANCELLATION OR OBLITERATION AS WILL REVOKE THE WILL,I243824,98 VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW DOES THE WRITING OF WORDS OF REVOCATION ACROSS THE FACE OF A WILL CONSTITUTE SUCH A CANCELLATION OR OBLITERA TION AS WILL REVOKE THE WILL THE RIGHT TO DISPOSE OF PROPERTY BY WILL HAS ALWAYS BEEN RE GARDED AS ONE OF OUR MOST VALUABLE POSSESSIONS IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL INSTINCT WITH MEN TO DESIRE THE POWER TO DIRECT HOW THEIR PROPERTY SHOULD BE DISTRIBUTED AFTER DEATH IN ORDER THAT THIS RIGHT MAY BE EXERCISED THE ENGLISH AND THE AMERICAN LAWS HAVE INVESTED THE EXECUTION OF A WILL WITH SUCH FORMALITIES AS WILL BEST INSURE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE INTENTION OF THE TESTATOR SUCH A WILL FORMALLY EXECUTED IS PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT AND SOLEMN DOCUMENT KNOWN TO THE LAW COEQUAL WITH THE RIGHT TO MAKE A WILL IS THE RIGHT TO REVOKE IT IT IS EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT THE MANNER IN WHICH A WILL MAY BE REVOKED IS A SUBJECT OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE A WILL MAY BE REVOKED BY DESTROYING IT PHYSICALLY WITH THE IN TENTION OF REVOKING IT THIS DESTRUCTION MAY BE ACCOMPLISHED BY BURNING TEARING OR DOING AWAY WITH IT IN ANY OTHER MANNER SECONDLY THE REVOCATION OF A WILL MAY BE ACCOMPLISHED BY MAK ING A NEW WILL WHICH IS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE OLD WILL AND THERE FORE IPSO FACTO REVOKES IT SIMILARLY A WILL MAY BE REVOKED BY THE EXECUTION OF A SEPARATE AND INDEPENDENT INSTRUMENT DECLAR ING ITS REVOCATION SUCH AN INSTRUMENT IS IN EFFECT ANOTHER WILL AND MUST BE EXECUTED WITH THE SAME FORMALITIES THAT ARE RE QUIRED BY LAW FOR THE EXECUTION OF A WILL FINALLY A WILL MAY BE REVOKED BY MAKING SOME EFFECTIVE INDICATION ON ITS FACE DE DARING ITS REVOCATION AN INSTRUMENT OF REVOCATION CAN OF COURSE BE EXECUTED ON THE FACE OF THE WILL BUT IN ORDER TO BE OPERATIVE AS AN INSTRUMENT OF REVOCATION IT MUST BE EXECUTED WITH THE SAME FORMALITIES THAT ARE REQUIRED FOR WILLS AND THE FACT THAT SUCH AN INSTRUMENT IS WRITTEN ACROSS THE FACE OF A WILL WOULD BE MERELY INCIDENTAL AND WOULD NOT ADD TO ITS EFFECTIVE NESS AS A WRITTEN REVOCATION THE FACE OF THE WILL MAY HOW EVER BE SO DEALT WITH AS TO REVOKE THE WILL WITHOUT WRITINGREVOCATION BY WRITING ACROSS FACE OF WILL 99 THEREON ANY WORDS OF REVOCATION THIS MAY BE ACCOMPLISHED BY TAKING SUCH ACTION WITHOUT DESTROYING THE WILL ITSELF AS WILL IN DICATE A DESIRE ON THE PART OF THE TESTATOR TO NULLIFY THE WORDS OF THE WILL THE TWO METHODS RECOGNIZED BY LAW FOR ACHIEVING THIS RESULT ARE KNOWN AS CANCELLATION AND OBLITERATION ACCORDINGLY THE REVOCATION OF WILLS BY CANCELLATION OR BY OBLITERATION IS A DISTINCT METHOD FOR ACCOMPLISHING THE DESIRED RESULT THE ENGLISH AND AMERICAN STATUTES PROVIDE FOR THE REVOCA TION OF WILLS IN ALL THESE DIFFERENT METHODS THE NEW YORK LAW ON THE SUBJECT IS TO BE FOUND AT SECTION 34 OF THE DECEDENT ES TATE LAW WHICH MAY BE TAKEN AS TYPICAL OF THE STATUTES OF THE DIFFERENT STATES THAT SECTION READS AS FOLLOWS SIC 34 RTVOCATION AND CANCFLLATION OP WRITTEN WILLS NO WILL IN WRITING EXCEPT IN THE CASES HEREINAFTER MEN TIONED NOR ANY PART THEREOF SHALL BE REVOKED OR ALTERED OTHERWISE THAN BY SOME OTHER WILL IN WRITING OR SOME OTHER WRITING OF THE TESTATOR DECLARING SUCH REVOCATION OR ALTERA TION AND EXECUTED WITH THE SAME FORMALITIES WITH WHICH THE WILL ITSELF WAS REQUIRED BY LAW TO BE EXECUTED OR UN LESS SUCH WILL BE BURNT TORN CANCELED OBLITERATED OR DE STROYED WITH THE INTENT AND FOR THE PURPOSE OF REVOKING THE SAME BY THE TESTATOR HIMSELF OR BY ANOTHER PERSON IN HIS PRESENCE BY HIS DIRECTION AND CONSENT AND WHEN SO DONE BY ANOTHER PERSON THE DIRECTION AND CONSENT OF THE TESTA TOR AND THE FACT OF SUCH INJURY OR DESTRUCTION SHALL BE PROVED BY AT LEAST TWO WITNESSES IT WILL BE NOTED THAT THIS STATUTE INCLUDES ALL THE METHODS OF REVOCATION WHICH HAVE BEEN MENTIONED BUT DOES NOT GROUP THEM ACCORDING TO THE ANALYSIS WHICH WE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO MAKE AT THE OUTSET THE QUESTION ARISES AS TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CANCELLATION AND OBLITERATION ON THIS POINT THERE HAS BEEN MUCH CONFUSION BOTH OF THOUGHT AND OF EXPRESSION IT MAY BE WELL TO BEGIN WITH THE ETYMOLOGY OF THE TWO TERMS THE WORD CAN CELLATION IS DERIVED FROM THE LATIN VERB CANCELLARE WHICH IN TURN TAKES ITS ORIGIN FROM THE PLURAL NOUN CANCELLI MEANING LAT TICE WORK THE ORIGINAL MEANING OF THE WORD THEREFORE AC CORDING TO ITS ETYMOLOGY IS TO MAKE CROSS MARKS RESEMBLING A LATTICE WORK OVER A WRITING AND THUS TO CROSS OR MARK IT OUT THE WORD OBLITERATION IS ROOTED IN THE LATIN VERB OBLINERE100 VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW WHICH MEANS ORIGINALLY TO DAUB OVER WITH SOME OTHER SUBSTANCE IN THE PRESENT CONNECTION THEREFORE TO OBLITERATE A WRITING IS ACCORDING TO THE ETYMOLOGICAL ORIGIN OF THE WORD TO DAUB OR SMEAR OVER THE WRITING WITH SOME OTHER SUBSTANCE FROM THIS EARLY MEANING THERE SOON SPRUNG OTHERS OF A KINDRED NATURE SO THAT TO OBLITERATE SOON MEANT NOT ONLY TO DAUB WITH ANOTHER SUB STANCE BUT TO SMEAR THE ORIGINAL WRITING AND THEN TO ERASE IT IT WILL BE READILY SEEN THAT THE TWO WORDS ALTHOUGH DISTINCT IN ORIGIN AND HAVING ORIGINALLY A DIFFERENT MEANING INEVITABLY TEND TO MERGE INTO EACH OTHER IF THE MARKS OR LATTICE WORK CONSTI TUTING A CANCELLATION ARE SUFFICIENTLY NUMEROUS AND HEAVY AND CLOSE TOGETHER THEY WILL SOON COVER ENTIRELY THE ORIGINAL WRITING AND THUS CONSTITUTE IN EFFECT AN OBLITERATION ON THE OTHER HAND A WRITING MAY BE DAUBED BY A FOREIGN SUBSTANCE OR SMEARED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE WORDS ARE NOT COMPLETELY HIDDEN THIS PAR TIAL OBLITERATION WOULD BE VERY HARD TO DISTINGUISH FROM A CAN CELLATION OR MARKING OUT FOR ILLUSTRATION A HEAVY LINE MAY BE DRAWN THROUGH A WORD SO AS TO COVER ONEHALF OF THE WRITING THIS WOULD BE A PARTIAL OBLITERATION BUT IT WOULD ALSO BE A MARK ING OR A CROSSING OUT AND CONSEQUENTLY WOULD CONSTITUTE A CAN CELLATION AS WELL AS AN OBLITERATION THIS MERGER IN THE MEAN ING OF THE TWO WORDS HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED IN SEVERAL CASES FOR INSTANCE IN GLASS V SCOTT THE COURT SAID THE ONLY OPPORTUNITY FOR DEBATE    DEPENDS ON THE POSSIBILITY OF GIVING THE WORDS CANCELLATION AND OBLITERA TION DIFFERENT AND DISTINCT MEANINGS WE ARE JUSTIFIED IN CONCLUDING THAT NEITHER JUSTIFY NOR PERMIT DIFFERENT DEFINI TIONS BOTH IN VIEW OF WHAT LEXICOGRAPHERS HAVE WRITTEN ON THE SUBJECT AND IN VIEW OF THE DECISION OF DISTINGUISHED COURTS ON THE SAME PROPOSITION NEITHER OUR STATUTE NOR THAT OF CHARLES NOR ANY OTHER STATUTE OF ANY STATE TO WHICH OUR ATTENTION HAS BEEN DIRECTED ATTEMPTS TO DECLARE WHAT SHALL AMOUNT TO CANCELLATION OR WHAT SHALL AMOUNT TO OB LITERATION THE WORDS ARE NOT TECHNICAL AND THE LEGISLA TURES MUST BE PRESUMED TO HAVE USED THEM IN THEIR ORDI NARY SENSE AND ACCORDING TO THEIR ORDINARY SIGNIFICATION    LONG BEFORE THE STATUTES OR ANY OF THEM WERE PASSED THESE WORDS HAD PASSED INTO COMMON USE AND HAD ACQUIRED AN ACCEPTED SIGNIFICATION WHICH HAS CONTINUED TO L 14 COLO APP 377 382 60 PAC 186REVOCATION BY WRITING ACROSS FACE OF WILL 101 THE PRESENT AN OBLITERATION OR A CANCELLATION WOULD BE EI THER ONE OR THE OTHER AND EFFECTIVE AS SUCH IF DONE WITH AN INTENT TO DESTROY AN INSTRUMENT AND RENDER IT INEFFECTUAL FOR THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH IT WAS ORIGINALLY PUT INTO CIRCULA TION IN THAT CASE THE COLORADO STATUTE ONLY PROVIDED FOR REVOCATION BY OBLITERATION AND DID NOT INCLUDE REVOCATION BY CANCELLATION THE TESTATRIX MARY GLASS HAD DRAWN A STRAIGHT LINE THROUGH THE SIGNATURE TO THE PROPOSED WILL AND HAD ALSO DRAWN TWO LINES DIAGONALLY THROUGH THE SAME SIGNATURE THE COURT HELD THAT THIS WAS BOTH A CANCELLATION AND AN OBLITERATION AND WAS SUFFICIENT UN DER THE COLORADO LAW TO REVOKE THE WILL ON THE OTHER HAND IN TOWNSEND V HOWARD2 A DISTINCTION IS DRAWN BETWEEN CANCELLATION AND OBLITERATION THE COURT SAYS TO CANCEL IS TO CROSS OUT TO OBLITERATE IS TO BLOT OUT THE FORMER LEAVES THE WORDS LEGIBLE THE LATTER LEAVES THE WORDS ILLEGIBLE IN THAT CASE THE SIGNATURES TO THE WILL WERE WRITTEN OVER OR ERASED BY LEAD PENCIL MARKING WHILE LINES WERE DRAWN THROUGH A CLAUSE OF THE WILL LEAVING A CERTAIN LEGACY THE COURT HELD THAT THE TESTATOR HAD REVOKED HIS WILL BOTH BY CANCELLATION AND BY OBLITERATION APPARENTLY HOLDING THE MARKING OVER OF THE SIG NATURES TO BE AN OBLITERATION AND THE DRAWING OF LINES THROUGH THE LEGACY CLAUSE TO BE A CANCELLATION IN MOST CASES THE DIS TINCTION BETWEEN CANCELLATION AND OBLITERATION IS OF NO IMPOR TANCE IF LINES OF ANY KIND ARE DRAWN ACROSS THE BODY OF THE WILL OR THROUGH THE SIGNATURE OF THE TESTATOR AND THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THIS WAS DONE FOR THE PURPOSE OF REVOKING THE ENTIRE WILL THEN SUCH ACT IS EITHER CANCELLATION OR OBLITERATION AND IN EITHER EVENT THE WILL IS REVOKED OF COURSE HOWEVER THE REVOCATION OF A WILL BY A SEPARATE IN STRUMENT CONTAINING WORDS OF REVOCATION IS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT THING FROM THE REVOCATION OF A WILL BY MEANS OF CANCELLATION OR OBLITERATION WHERE THE REVOCATION IS SOUGHT TO BE ACCOMPLISHED BY A SEPARATE INSTRUMENT CONTAINING APPROPRIATE WORDS OF REVO CATION THE INSTRUMENT MUST BE EXECUTED BEFORE THE SAME NUM BER OF WITNESSES AND IN THE SAME MANNER REQUIRED BY LAW FOR THE 2 86 ME 285 288 29 ATD 1077102 VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW EXECUTION OF A WILL IF THE WORDS OF REVOCATION ARE WRITTEN ACROSS THE FACE OF THE WILL THEY ARE NOT EFFECTIVE AS A SEPARATE INSTRUMENT OF REVOCATION UNLESS SIGNED AND EXECUTED WITH THESE FORMALITIES THE FACT THAT THE WORDS OF REVOCATION ARE WRITTEN ACROSS THE FACE OF THE WILL DOES NOT INCREASE THEIR EFFECTIVENESS AS A SEPARATE INSTRUMENT OF REVOCATION BUT THE INTERESTING QUESTION THEN ARISES AS TO WHETHER SUCH WORDS OF REVOCATION WRITTEN ACROSS THE FACE OF THE WILL CONSTITUTE A CANCELLATION OR OBLITERATION OF THE WILL AND THUS ACCOMPLISH ITS REVOCATION A RATHER EXTRAORDINARY CASE INVOLVING THIS QUESTION HAS JUST BEEN DECIDED IN THE SURROGATES COURT OF WESTCHESTER COUNTY NEW YORK AND REPORTED IN THE NEW YORK LAW JOURNAL JULY 13 1922 UNDER THE TITLE IN THE MATTER OF GEORGE W PARSONS THE TESTATOR GEORGE W PARSONS WAS A RESIDENT OF HOBOKEN NEW JERSEY AND DIED IN THE COUNTY OF WESTCHESTER ON JULY 12TH 1921 IN HIS SAFE DEPOSIT BOX WAS FOUND A

MR PARSONS SAFE DEPOSIT BOX WITH THE INSCRIPTIONS WRITTEN THEREON THERE IS A PRESUMPTION THAT THESE INSCRIPTIONS WERE WRITTEN BY HIM WITH THE INTENTION TO REVOKE THE WILL3 THE WILL WAS FIRST OFFERED IN THE SURROGATES COURT OF NEW YORK COUNTY SURROGATE COHALAN A MOST ABLE AND EXPERIENCED JURIST HELD THAT THE WILL WAS NOT REVOKED AND ENTERED A DECREE ADMITTING IT TO PROBATE HE HELD THAT THE WORDS OF REVOCATION WERE NOT EFFECTIVE AS AN INDEPENDENT INSTRUMENT OF REVOCATION BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT EXECUTED WITH THE SAME FORMALITIES WITH WHICH THE WILL ITSELF WAS REQUIRED BY LAW TO BE EXECUTED HE HELD FURTHER THAT THE WRITING OF THESE WORDS ACROSS THE FACE OF THE WILL WAS NEITHER A CANCELLATION NOR AN OBLITERATION SUCH AS WOULD REVOKE THE INSTRUMENT ON THIS POINT HE SAYS PROCEEDING TO THE SECOND PART OF SECTION 34 OF THE DECEDENTS ESTATE LAW THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE WILL WAS NOT BURNED TORN OBLITERATED OR DESTROYED BUT WAS IT CANCELLED TO 3 MATTER OF HOPKINS 172 N Y 360 363 4 117

HOLOGRAPHIC AS IN THIS CASE AND IT WAS WRITTEN UPON LEGAL CAP PAPER WHICH CONTAINED A MARGINAL LINE TO THE LEFT IN THE BLANK MARGIN OF SPACE AND RUN NING LENGTHWISE THE TESTATOR HAD WRITTEN THE WORDS THIS WILL AND CODICIL IS REVOKED JANUARY 14 96 AND UNDER SUCH WORDS HAD AFFIXED HIS SIGNATURE IN THAT CASE NONE OF THE WORDS OF REVOCATION WERE WRITTEN ACROSS ANY OTHER WRIT ING OF THE WILL ITSELF THE COURT HELD THAT THERE WAS NO REVOCATION OR CANCELLATION THAT THE CASE WAS DECIDED ON THE GROUND THAT AN EXAMINATION OF THE WILL DISCLOSED THE FACT THAT THERE WERE NO MARKS ON THE BODY OF THE WILL WHICH IN ANY WAY CANCELLED OR OBLITERATED IN ANY PARTICULAR STAT ING THAT IN THE CASES CALLED TO THE ATTENTION OF THE COURT THERE HAD BEEN A PHYSICAL CANCELLATION OF SOME OF THE WORDS OF THE WILL ACCOMPANIED BY AN INTENT TO CANCEL IN THIS WILL BEFORE THE COURT THERE IS NO OBLITERATION TRUE THE WORDS ARE WRITTEN ACROSS THE FACE OF THE WILL INSTEAD OF ON THE MARGIN AS IN THE AKERS CASE BUT AS THERE IS NO OBLITERATION OR BLURRING OUT OF THE CONTEXTS OF THE WILL THE SAME REA SONING APPLIES TO THE FACTS IN THIS CASE AS WAS APPLIED BY THE COURT IN THE AKERS CASE THE TESTATOR ON THIS WILL HAS WRITTEN AND EXPRESSED AN INTENT TO REVOKE HIS WILL BUT HAS FAILED TO COMPLETE AND CARRY OUT SUCH INTENT BY THE PHYSICAL ACT OF OBLITERATION OR CANCELLATION THE USUAL METHOD OF CANCELLING ANY WRITING IS BY DRAWING LINES THROUGH IT OR OTHERWISE STRIKING IT OUT IN THIS CASE THERE IS AN ABORTIVE ATTEMPT TO REVOKE THIS WILL BY SOME OTHER WRITING INEFFEC TIVE ON THE FIRST PART OF THE STATUTE TO ACCOMPLISH SUCH RE SULT AND UNACCOMPANIED BY ANY OBLITERATION SUFFICIENT TO AC COMPLISH THE RESULT AS A CANCELLATION UNDER THE SECOND PART OF THE STATUTE IN THE AKERS CASE THE OPINION STATES THAT THE GREAT WEIGHT OF AUTHORITY IS TO THE EFFECT THAT THE MEREREVOCATION BY WRITING ACROSS FACE OF WILL 105 WRITING UPON A WILL WHICH DOES NOT IN ANYWISE PHYSICALLY OBLITERATE OR CANCEL THE SAME IS INSUFFICIENT TO WORK A DE STRUCTION OF THE WILL BY CANCELLATION EVEN THOUGH THE URT ING MAY EXPRESS AN INTENTION TO REVOKE OR CANCEL SUCH IS THE CASE IN THE WILL NOW BEFORE THE COURT THIS WILL IS SOUGHT TO BE REVOKED BY THE TESTATOR SOLELY BY WRITING AND AS IT DOES NOT COMPLY WITH THE STATUTE THE REVOCATION HAS FAILED FAILING OF REVOCATION BY WRITING RELIANCE CANNOT BE HAD ON THE WORDS ALONE TO EFFECT A CANCELLATION OF THE WILL SUCH WORDS MUST BE DISREGARDED WHEN THEY ARE INSUFFICIENT PHYSICALLY TO ACCOMPLISH THIS RESULT IT IS EVIDENT THAT SURROGATE COHALAN BASED HIS DECISION ON THE AUTHORITY OF THE AKERS CASE AS APPEARS HOWEVER FROM HIS OWN STATEMENT OF THE FACTS THE WORDS OF REVOCATION IN THAT CASE DID NOT CROSS ANY OF THE WRITING WHICH CONSTRUED THE WILL AS THOSE WORDS WERE WRITTEN ON THE BLANK MARGINAL SPACE IT IT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND HOW UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES THERE COULD BE ANY OBLITERATION OR CANCELLATION AS WAS SAID IN THE AKERS CASE 5 AN EXAMINATION OF THE WILL HOWEVER DOES NOT DISCLOSE THE SLIGHTEST MARK UPON THE BODY OF THE WILL WHICH IN ANY FORM CANCELS OR OBLITERATES IT IN ANY PART ON THE CONTRARY IT IS QUITE EVIDENT THAT THE SURNAME OF THE TESTATOR IS PLACED SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE LINE OF THE GIVEN NAME AND EVIDENTLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF AVOIDING CONTACT WITH THE WORDS OF THE WILL AND THE WHOLE WRITING HAS NOT CANCELED A SINGLE LETTER THERE CAN BE NO SUCH THING AS A CANCELLATION OF AN INSTRU MENT EITHER AS A PHYSICAL FACT OR AS A LEGAL INFERENCE UNLESS THE INSTRUMENT ITSELF IS IN SOME FORM DEFACED OR OBLITERATED SUCH IS THE EXPRESS DEFINITION OF THE TERM IN LEGAL SIGNIFI CANCE 1 BURR LAW DICT 177 AFTER THE WILL HAD BEEN ADMITTED TO PROBATE BY SURROGATE CO HALAN IN NEW YORK COUNTY AND WHILE AN APPEAL WAS PENDING FROM THAT DECREE IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE SURROGATES COURT OF NEW YORK COUNTY HAD NO JURISDICTION TO ENTERTAIN AN APPLI CATION FOR THE PROBATE OF THE WILL AS THE DECEDENT HAD NOT DIED IN THAT COUNTY AND WAS NOT A RESIDENT THEREOF ACCORDINGLY A PE TITION WAS FILED TO VACATE THE DECREE OF PROBATE UPON THESE JURIS DICTIONAL GROUNDS WHICH WAS GRANTED THEN ONE OF THE LEGATEES UNDER THE WILL THE PROTESTANT EPIS 5 74 APP DIV

CROSSING OUT A WRITING THE MANUAL OPERATION OF TEARING OR DESTROY ING A WRITTEN INSTRUMENT BOUVIERS LAW DICTIONARY 3D ED 416 IT IS THE COURTS OPINION THAT THE WORDS USED IN THE CASE OF AKERS THE GREAT WEIGHT OF AUTHORITY IS TO THE EFFECT THAT A MERE WRITING UPON A WILL WHICH DOES NOT IN ANYWISE PHYSICALLY OBLITERATE OR CANCEL THE SAME IS INSUFFI CIENT TO WORK A DESTRUCTION OF THE WILL BY CANCELLATION EVEN THOUGH THE WRITING MAY EXPRESS AN INTENTION TO REVOKE OR CANCEL WAS MEANT TO REFER ONLY TO THE PARTICULAR FACTS OF THAT CASE THE WORDS OF REVOCATION IN THE CASE OF AKERS WERE ON A MARGIN OF THE PAPER WRITING AND NOT ACROSS THE FACE OF THE WILL WHEN WORDS OF REVOCATION WITH THE SIG NATURE ARE WRITTEN DIAGONALLY ACROSS THE FACE OF THE WORDS OF THE WILL IT OBLITERATES THEM IT CANCELS THEM AND EXPRESSES AN INTENTION TO ANNUL THEM THE CASE OF AKERS RESEMBLES THE MATTER OF MILLER 50 MISC 70 WHERE AN ENDORSEMENT INDICATING WORDS OF REVOCATION WAS UPON THE BACK OF THE WILL IN

MAY LEAVE IT AS LEGIBLE AS BEFORE THE WORDS BURNING CANCEL ING OBLITERATING AND DESTROYING ARE USED IN THE POPULAR SENSE CANCELLATION OF A WILL MEANS ANY ACT DONE WHICH IN COMMON UNDERSTANDING IS

OF A WILL SO COMPLETELY THAT THEY CANNOT BE READ A LINE DRAWN THROUGH A WRITING IS DOUBTLESS OBLITERATION THOUGH IT MAY LEAVE IT AS LEGIBLE AS IT WAS BEFORE OBLITERA TION IS NOT ANNIHILATION BUT WE MUST HAVE BOTH AN ACT AND INTENT CONCURRING THE FACT THAT THE TESTATOR USED THE WORD REVOKE IS OF IMPORTANCE IT IS THE INTENT THAT GOVERNS AND IF THAT IS CLEAR FROM THE WORDS THAT ARE USED THE ACT

FORM AND EXTENT OR OTHER ESSENCE ARE ALL TO TALLY UNIMPORTANT SO LONG AS THEY ARE A PHYSICAL TOKEN OF THE INWARD INTENT IF THE MARKS IN THE LIGHT OF ALL SURROUNDINGS SYMBOLIZE THIS PURPOSE THEIR MISSION IS PERFORMED WHETHER THEY BE PLAIN OR FANTASTIC MECHANICAL OR VERBALLY INTELLIGIBLE THOUGH TRACED IN THE FORM OF LETTERS THE LINES IN THIS CASE WERE DRAWN ACROSS THE WILL WITH THE STATUTORY INTENT THAT IT SHOULD THEREBY BECOME NULL AND VOID IN MATTER OF AKERS 74 APP DIV 461 THE COURT HELD THAT WORDS OF REVOCATION WRITTEN AND SIGNED UPON THE PAPER ON WHICH THE WILL WAS WRITTEN WERE TO BE NARROWLY REGARDED AS A WRITING OF THE TESTATOR AND NOT A CANCELLATION THE WORDS IN THAT CASE WERE WHOLLY WRITTEN UPON THE MARGIN OF THE ORIGINAL INSTRUMENT AND THE COURT SAID IT IS QUITE EVIDENT THAT THE SURNAME OF THE TESTATOR IN THE SUPPLEMEN TAL WRITING IS PLACED SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE LINE OF THE GIVEN NAME AND EVIDENTLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF AVOIDING CONTACT WITH THE WORDS OF THE WILL AND THE WHOLE WRITING HAS NOT CANCELED A SINGLE LETTER THE PROCESSES AND CONCLUSION OF THE COURT IN THAT CASE SO OB VIOUSLY INDICATE A CONVICTION THAT THE CONTRARY RESULT WOULD HAVE BEEN REACHED IF THE ADDITIONAL WRITING HAD TRESPASSED UPON THE FACE OF THE PRIMARY INSTRUMENT THAT A TRIAL COURT SHOULD SUBMIT ITS JUDGMENT TO THE IMPLIED VIEW EVEN THOUGH IT NEED NOT BE NECESSARILY REGARDED AS A CONTROLLING AUTHOR ITY THIS IS MORE READILY DONE SINCE THE REASONING OF THE CASE IS ACCEPTABLE TO THIS COURT IN ADDITION TO THE QUOTATION ALREADY MADE THE OPINION CON112 VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW STANTLY REPEATS AS THE ESSENTIAL BASIS FOR THE DECISION THE FACT THAT THE LATER WRITING DID NOT TOUCH THE ORIGINAL SCRIPT THE CASE AT BAR CANNOT ESCAPE THE EFFECT OF THE FOLLOWING WORDS FROM THE LAST CASE CITED HERE WE HAVE NO OBLITERA TION WHATEVER AND NOTHING EXCEPT THE WRITING UPON THE MARGIN OF THE WILL AND THE PURPORTED CODICIL IN ALL OF THE CASES TO WHICH OUR ATTENTION HAS BEEN CALLED THERE HAS BEEN A PHYSICAL CANCELLATION OF SOME OF THE WORDS OF THE WILL AC COMPANIED BY AN INTENT TO CANCEL CITING CASES THE GREAT WEIGHT OF AUTHORITY IS TO THE EFFECT THAT A MERE WRITING UPON A WILL WHICH DOES NOT IN ANYWISE PHYSICALLY OBLITERATE OR CAN CEL THE SAME IS INSUFFICIENT TO WORK A DESTRUCTION OF THE WILL BY CANCELLATION EVEN THOUGH THE WRITING MAY EXPRESS AN INTENTION TO REVOKE AND CANCEL THERE MUST BE A DECREE REFUSING PROBATE AN APPEAL HAS BEEN TAKEN FROM THE DECISION OF SURROGATE SLATER TO THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT IN THE OPINION OF THE WRITER SURROGATE SLATER WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE AF FIRMED IN THAT COURT UPON THE GROUNDS SET FORTH IN HIS OWN ABLE OPINION AND ALSO IN THAT OF SURROGATE KETCHAM IN THE BARNES CASE THERE IS A SOMEWHAT ELUSIVE THOUGHT INVOLVED IN THE CONSID ERATION OF THIS QUESTION IT IS THIS NEITHER MR BARNES NOR MR PARSONS INTENDED TO MAKE LATTICE WORK MARKS ACROSS THE FACE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE WILLS NEITHER DID THEY HAVE ANY THOUGHT OF OBLITERATING THEIR WILLS IN THE SENSE OF SMEARING THEM OVER WITH INK OR OTHER FOREIGN SUBSTANCE OR OF ERASING THEM THEY IN TENDED TO DO JUST WHAT THEY DID I E TO WRITE WORDS OF REVOCA TION OR AS SURROGATE KETCHAM EXPRESSED IT A LEGEND OF REVOCA TION ACROSS THE FACE OF THE WILL BUT IN AND BY WRITING THESE WORDS THEY DID DRAW LINES ACROSS THE FACE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE WILLS WITH THE INTENTION OF REVOKING THEM AND TO DRAW A LINE ACROSS THE FACE OF A WILL ANIMO REVOCANDI IS TO CANCEL OR TO OBLITERATE IT AND SO THEY DID CANCEL OR OBLITERATE THEIR WILLS UNDER THE PROVI SIONS OF THE STATUTE THEY DID THE THING NAMED IN THE STATUTE AND WITH THE INTENT REQUIRED BY THE STATUTE THE DECISIONS OF SURROGATE SLATER AND OF SURROGATE KETCHAM EFFECT THE INTENTION OF THE TESTATOR AND ARE EVIDENTLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH JUSTICE AS WELL AS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE STATUTEREVOCATION BY WRITING ACROSS FACE OF WILL 113 IT MAY BE SAID THAT THIS IS A MINUTE POINT FOR SUCH A LENGTHY DISCUSSION ON THE CONTRARY IT IS A MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION IT IS A VERY NATURAL THING FOR A MAN WHO HAS MADE A WILL AND WISHES TO REVOKE IT TO WRITE INFORMAL WORDS OF REVOCATION ACROSS THE FACE OF A PAPER LARGE INTERESTS HAVE BEEN AND WILL BE AF FECTED BY THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER SUCH AN ACTION CONSTITUTES A REVOCATION THE SUBJECT IS WORTHY OF CAREFUL CONSIDERATION AT THE HANDS OF THE LAW STUDENT AND THE PRACTICING LAWYER GEO GORDON BATTLE NEW YORK N Y

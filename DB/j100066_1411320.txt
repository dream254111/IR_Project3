j100066,The American Journal of Psychology,1411320,Insistent and Fixed Ideas,i261569,INSISTENT AND FIXED IDEAS BY EDWARD COWLES M 1 The student of introspective psychology must assume a standard of cerebral and mental health as the basis of his study It must be sought in the healthy mind in a healthy brain these are the inseparable subjects of the inquiry The student of insanity must assume in like man ner the same standard of soundness for that which is insane and he must study it in the terms of psychol ogy and the physiological basis is definite enough if the communications with it are maintained to permit safe and even bold excursions among the dangers of error that beset the path of the purely intuitional school With practical reference to such a standard modern psychiatry has the credit of having differ entiated two general groups of idiopathic mental dis orders The first group includes those that may happen to any healthy mind in a healthy brain and are manifested in typical and regular forms and courses of mental phenomena The other contains those that occur in unstable minds correlative to constitutional brain defecthereditary or acquiredand that are manifested in more or less irregular forms in which the phenomena are made distinctive by being modified and varied in their order and degree from those in the first group The term ordinary insanity has beenINSISTENT AND FIXED IDEAS applied to the disorders that spring from a relatively sound physical basis The modern use of the term paranoia has been gradually enlarged till it tends to include all manifestations of hereditary and ac quired chronic instability of mind Thus there may be ordinary insanity in relation to the healthy brain and paranoia in the unstable mind and defective brain The general relation of these phys ical and psychical elements may thus be stated in terms of function as the stable mind is to the unstable one so are the disorderspsychosesincident to the former to the degenerative psychoses in the latter or so is ordinary insanity to paranoia While pathology and psychophysics are striving to let in the light upon the mechanism of mental phe nomena the clinical student must not wait for their guidance His work is as essential to the elucidation of the truth and his data are definite tangible and constant enough to endow them with scientific values The science of psychopathology deals directly with the central object itself the mind is the man and the conservation of mental integrity is the aim In the minute study of the psychical elements involved the clinical student has in his field as important a branch of the new psychology as the pathologist or the psycho physicist all must work together in the solution of the problems The recent words of Sir James Paget upon another subject are as applicable here that the sickroom is a laboratory with its crucial experiments as real as those in which  culture experiments are instituted in bacteriology Kraepelin speaking of natural science as the great method in medicine says that only by the inner connection of brain pathology with psycho 223COWLE  pathology can we succeed in finding the laws of the reciprocal relation between somatic and psychic dis turbance and thus get to a really deeper understand ing of the phenomena of insanity Sir J Crichton Browne strongly stated in 1878 the absurdity of rest ing upon an intimate knowledge of braincells or of the deviations from healthy mental states in which insanity consists Advancement must be made on both these lines which must converge and unite But he also says in that particular branch of psychology that is conversant with morbid mental states little or no work is being done in Great Britain In the literature of insanity of today there is no attempt at mental analysis and only a most perfunc tory attempt at a classification of the expressions and products of the diseased mind2 Exner also in his remarkable study of cerebral localization found reason to complain of the inadequacy with which clinical symptoms are described in asylum reports8 To a better purpose is Kandinskys very full and exceptionally fine study of three cases of hallucina tions He says What is wanted first of all is a severe accurate and detailed study of the phenomena of hallucinations and but very few three by Sander and one by Pick have been studied with sufficient care4 In modern psychiatry there is an evident ten dency to return to the study of psychical phenomena and to break away somewhat from the dicta of the cerebralists Insanity in its origin at least may be Kraepelin Compendium der Psychiatrie 1883 p 3 Presidential Address British MedicoPsychological Association Journal of Mental Science Oct 1878 3Exner Localisation der

proposition that every manifestation of mind is correlated to a definite mode and sphere of brain activity and the aim being a convention of the two lines of study the indications are plain to the alienist Psychopathology demands upon one of these lines careful and detailed analyses of morbid psychical reactions This article is an attempt to comply with that demand From the clinical point of view the student finds himself in a region of everwidening interest and nov elty for so much of it is unexplored In examining these products some salient or eccentric growth brings to light or emphasizes common factors of the whole that would otherwise remain obscure The infinite variety of the human mind is in nowise more plainly revealed than in its aberrations In the whole range of its special powers or qualities they may become singly or in groups more conspicuous by their relative luxuriance or exaggeration or by their absence or weakness and impairment In the broad borderland of minor and partial aberrations there is an instructive field for study At the points of departure from the normal states of mind is to be sought the genesis of mental disorders and their nature is shown by the study of their origins The nature also of the normal faculties themselves may be thus made clearer A most fertile source of such knowledge is to be found in that great group of limited disorders of ideation called fixed ideas In the understanding of these affections a great advance has been made within the last few years They have been studied Cf Savage Insanity 1884 pp 4 21 225COWLES especially by the Germans French and Italians during the last thirty years and many names given to different varieties but it remained for Tamburinil to show the common relation of these affections under the term Zwangsvorstellungen first applied by Krafft Ebing They include the metaphysical insanity insanity of doubting and the many forms of fears of places and things Kandinsky mentions the difficulties of getting the intelligent cooperation of patients in his studies of hallucinations The importance of the study of im perative conceptions is as great and while its profit may be relatively much greater as touching earlier stages or less degrees of aberration in these cases also the comparative integrity of the intelligence except as specially involved is a great aid It is curiously possible to enucleate as it were certain well defined ideas and feelings and to study their reactions between each other and the will The general characteristics of the cases yet de scribed  are thus briefly stated by Tamburini  1st That side by side with a fixed idea which is accom panied by fears more or less distressing and an over powering impulsion to certain acts consciousness of the absurdity of such acts usually remains complete 2d That in all there is an almost absolute impotence of the will not only to control the absurd ideas but also an irrestrainable tendency to those acts 3d That in almost all the cases there was a very conspic uous hereditary predisposition to psychopathic dis orders  Revista Sperimentale di Flreniatria Fascicolo 1 1883 Translated by Joseph Workman M D Alienist and Neurologist January 1884 226INSISTENT AND FIXED IDEAS A varied collection of cases of these affections has afforded the writer a study of great interest for a number of years In these cases the relation seems to be clearly shown of these limited ideational dis orders to primary delusional insanity as indicated by Westphals designation of them as abortive mono mania Not only this but in my observations there appears to be ample evidence that there may be every degree of development of these disorders from the slightest departure from normal intellection to pro nounced delusional conceptions Also that instead of passing in the typical way from stage to stage the process may be arrested at any point in its progress and remain at a chronic stasis during the remainder of a lifetime There is a multitude of the cases of the minor degree which as far as they go have all the essential characteristics of  fixed ideas but in which the idea is not so fixed as to be always domi nant it can be resisted more or less successfully at will in the milder cases which are in a large majority The ideas are simply insistent and the term  insistent ideas is here proposed as being the more generic and as including all forms some of which become imperative and fixed Here the words idea and fixed idea are distinctive in contrast with delusion or fixed and limited delusion The one is not a belief while the other has attained the pronounced degree of an insane belief Again contrary to the conclusions of writers on the subject it would appear that these affections are not  chiefly limited to a constitutional origin espec ially to heredity Here arises one of the most inter esting questions Primary systematized delusions so characterize paranoia and so close is the relation 227COWLES between them and fixed ideas or imperative concep tions that these also are included in paranoia by many writers with the implication that these affec tions always signify a constitutional origin in either acquired or hereditary defect But degenerative psychoses are not manifestations of new powers acquired by morbidity in the organism there is not more mind in the paranoiac brain The criterion of insanity is not essentially the formulation of incon gruous insane conceptions  this is common enough in the sane mind and healthy brainwitness dreams the play of the imagination etc The inability to correct some of these or to inhibit others consti tutes the insanity Of imperative conceptions we should expect a priori to find that the conceptions are common enough to sound minds But where in the scale of increasing insistence fixedness or im perativeness does evidence begin of their having a paranoiac basis of hereditary or acquired defect and mental instability So too of systematized delu sions if but rare in a sound mind this is enough to establish the premise Proper conservation demands at least a stay of inferences and implications in this matter It might be expected to be nearer the truth to say that insistent and fixed ideas especially in their milder and often  corrected  forms are common to healthy minds and brains or to those which have no more acquired instability  or neurasthenia than would be argued as existing in a melancholia or mania of an ordinary insanity As forming a symptom group of ideational disorders in the prodromal or abortive stages of ordinary insanity they become like delusions empha sized in paranoia Thus these affections being once 228INSISTENT AND FIXED IDEAS initiated the gravest forms are simply more likely to be developed upon a basis of neurasthenia or the more radical paranoiac conditions in other words when there is hereditary or acquired nervous and mental instability In regard to other views that have been held of these affections it does not seem necessary to delve deeply into the mysteries of  the inconscient  for an explanation of all these anomalies Again the com mon kinship of the recognized varieties of these affec tions as shown by Tamburini is finely demonstrated in a number of my cases in which there have been developed in succession in each individual case several of the distinct forms These transitions are not unusual and it is probable that some of the forms now recog nized as distinct if it were possible to trace them to their origin would be found to be secondary to the more common primitive ones It is not the present intention to attempt a demonstra tion of these propositions which are thus broadly stated for the sake of indicating the nature and the interest of the questions that arise in these investigations The limits of this article permit simply a detailed account of a case in which there is much to sustain the fore going propositions The unusual intelligence of the patient allowed a long series of mental phenomena occupying years to be traced even from their origin At the outset the case was a common one of the insanity of doubting in which the idea was that simple acts were not right and it was necessary to repeat them to make them so The complications that followed and the stages of the malady through which the patient passed came partly by logical evolution from the false premises and partly from the growth of 229COWLES a habit of methodizing thought and action the latter was a characteristic process of circumvention of the limited imperative conception against which the will was powerless for direct resistance The processes of evasion were invented and systematized by a keen intel ligence and carried out by an otherwise efficient will to the effect of accomplishing the desired purposes without directly antagonizing the fixed ideas An interesting feature of the case is the unique combina tion of the characteristic fear of the patient for herself with a  fear  in behalf of and a  jealousy  against another person for whom she had both  love and  admiration The interplay and compli cation of these feelings are illustrations also of the probable fact that the abnormal association of  ideas and their accompanying feelings may commonly enough involve in like manner other feelings than the fears of which so many varieties are named This case with its extended details is here presented as a preliminary study of the subject The medical  re porting  of such a personal history is justified by the proffered permission of this lady and by other proper consent Miss M came under my care as an asylum patient at the age of 28 years She was of a good family in heredity and otherwise and both the parents were then living and over 70 years of age She was the youngest of ten children all of whom had been healthy except two sisters who died of phthisis after marriage The patient had a good physique was a little above the average stature and in good bodily health in all particulars She soon established herself in a com pany of lady patients of the better or convalescent class as a person of more than ordinary intelligence 230INSISTENT AND FIXED IDEAS and good sense and as usually amiable pleasing and dignified in manner though reticent she was not unsocial She was disposed however to dress very plainly and to be negligent in this regard in a way that was inconsistent with her evident appreciation of what was pleasing and proper Her intellect was to ordinary observation apparently unimpaired and for a period of more than two years she revealed her morbid mental peculiarities to none but two of her physicians She was well informed read good books chose the most intelligent persons as companions could easily follow and take part in a psychological analysis of her own case was keen of insight and quick at repartee She was depressed at times and inclined to seclude herself in her room and later she was some times irritable and sarcastic toward her associates but in general she was known to them only as possess ing the creditable characteristics above described In brief she was in many respects an interesting person To her physicians however she presented a medley of curious and inconsistent symptoms She was admitted to the asylum as a case of suicidal melan cholia but as a voluntary patient without a regular examination and commitment as an insane person The immediate cause of her coming was a suicidal act It is of special interest and importance in the diagnosis of some cases of primary disorders of intellection to differentiate them from those of the feelings characterizing true melancholia this case strikingly illustrates the relation and contrast between these two forms of mental disease To make this plain it is necessary to give an outline of this patients history as it was received on her admission and the earlier observations of the case before its riddle was solved 231COWLES There was no known neurotic heredity in the family history She had always been physically strong and healthy and never employed a physician At about the age of nineteen years she first attracted atten tion to her mental disorder by secluding herself and refusing to see her friends At about the age of twenty five years her relatives became fully impressed that her condition was morbid and serious She excluded them from her room was difficult to manage and spent her time in slovenly indolence Four months before becoming my patient she was brought to a neighboring institution for the treatment of nervous diseases It was said that while there she was shy and silent exercised no care of her clothing or person neither working nor reading lying on the bed if not watched and all efforts to interest her in anything were failures At times she was much agitated and felt that she was going crazy and said my proper place is in an insane asylum She gradually became more depressed and suspicious and entertained delusions of a gloomy character of her own wickedness in relation to indiscretions of her early years and of great wrongdoing It was stated that she developed the delusion that all who have any thing to do with her would suffer injury or death and that she made vows not to do certain things and enter tained the delusion that by breaking them she brought trouble perhaps death on a friend of hers Finally she got access to a bottle of laudanum and took  three or four teaspoonfuls apparently with suicidal intent  She manifested no remorse but sorrowfor her failure When remonstrated with was sullen and threatened to do it again at the first opportunity Two days afterward she was brought to the asylum 232INSISTENT AND FIXED IDEAS Her intelligence reasonableness and selfpossession led to her being placed at once with the convalescent patients and her manifest satisfaction with the change was significant in the light of later revelations Her general demeanor was as has been described but she was carefully watched never allowed to seclude her self and by night as well as by day the door of her room was kept partly open There were signs of mental depression at times and she was very reticent at first but soon she began to repeat to her physicians the self accusation before mentioned and later told a story of having attempted homicidal acts and alluded to other events of her history which she regarded as evidences of depravity and loss of conscience this was not con sistent with her daily ladylike conduct She spoke of herself as being insane but at last discovered that she was unlike other patients who had melancholia Indeed the notable absence of the characteristic under lying depression of feelings piqued inquiry Her keenness of intellect and brightwitted though re spectful rejection of the customary comforting assur ances of possible recovery were entertaining as well as baffling The assemblage of symptoms seemed anomalous She at length said to me  I have a mono mania and gave me more fully than before a curious puzzling account of a longexisting fear that her ordinary acts might do harm to a lady friend whom she had always loved and admired and whom she said she had once maliciously attempted to injure and she manifested genuine grief about it She readily under stood and gladly accepted the explanation of the absurdity of these and other ideas and tried to act upon this view of them The characteristic qualities of a delusion appeared to be absent and the depres 233COWLES sion to be secondary or as KrafftEbing says pro ceeding from the sad consciousness of the formal disorder of ideationalmost always painful and some times dangerous Soon after admission she began to insist that her previous suicidal act was not done with that intent but gave a halting explanation of it She finally over came her reticence enough to give an intelligible and undoubtedly truthful account of the affair and its motive essentially as follows It appears that her intense pride had for years kept her from revealing the secret of her mental troubles and the only excep tion to this was an intimation to her mother on one occasion It was a new experience to have a sympa thizing physician and it became a source of comfort to her Into her selfinquisition there finally came the idea of some impropriety on her part in finding the physicians visits to be agreeable and upon this as a basis of selfaccusation she finally determined to escape from the perfectly proper relation of which she morbidly thought herself ashamed She thought she ought to be placed among the insane and so conceived the plan of feigning the suicidal act suggested by the opportunity that offered itself She purposely limited the dose of laudanum to a moderate quantity and chose a time when its effect would be discovered in season to prevent serious consequences She thought she would be sent to an asylum and so conducted her self after the event as to insure this result All this being regarded as evidence of absence of true suicidal feeling and motive it formed an important factor in determining the subsequent treatment of the case as not being one of true melancholia She gave vague and partial accounts of many years 234INSISTENT AND FIXED IDEAS of mental pain declared her hopelessness of recovery and that death offered the only possible relief Look ing significantly about her room for points of suspen sion she would say to me that she could not do it here but if it were possible she would end her troubles The consequent surveillance became annoying to her and she begged to have her chamber door closed at night When asked to promise that she would not attempt selfinjury she acknowledged the rightfulness of the request but said You cannot trust me my pledge is worth nothing I have no conscience and cannot trust myself my life is ruined and I justify myself in always gratifying my wicked desires regardless of right or wrong She was told that she was mistaken that she showed more than ordinary keenness of con science and that it was only a morbid sensitiveness of it that prompted unjust and undeserved selfreproach that her sense of honor was so strong that I knew she could not betray my confidence that she would be trusted and must make the promise The promise was made her door closed at night and the watching largely abated New information now received from her relatives gave an interesting insight into her real character She was described by her teacher when at the age of ten or eleven years as the brightest of a large class of girls and remarkably conscientious once refusing to wear a medal awarded to her for the reason that she thought the honor belonged to another  She was the most truthful child the teacher ever knew the life of the school intelligent highspirited and be loved  She maintained these characteristics until the age of twentyfive years She was as a school girl mentally superior to her associates and distin 235COWLES guished for her truthfulness and unselfishness Though naturally reticent as to her personal feelings she was bright and companionable esteemed and admired by her friends This corroborates the estimate made of her even under the adverse conditions of an asylum All went well with her for several months under the enforced parole She grew more cheerful and less reticent as to the details of her previous history Then one more incident occurred which is of interest in the aspect of the case now under consideration as to the significance of its bearing upon the question of melan cholia Five months after her admission a suicidal accident happened in another part of the house in my absence my assistants were naturally anxious Just then this patient made to one of them a remark the subject of which when occasionally mentioned to me had been treated as tabooedthat is the allusion to suicide and that she thought there was no way here The revival of close watching was a natural consequence and her offered promise  not to attempt it here  was not understood or accepted Aggrieved by this she made one of her selfimposed vows which will be Jiereafter described as character istic that she would never make another promise Upon an appeal to me she agreed to the soundness and justice of the position that there should rightly be the guaranty of her pledge before the restoration of her privileges She begged that the promise should be waived for she said You know how dreadfully I shall suffer if I break my vow but if you insist I must do it With my practical belief in the true nature of her malady she was told after some days of con sidering it and setting forth my responsibility that the nurse would be at once directed to restore her 236INSISTENT AND FIXED IDEAS former privileges as if she had again given her parole but that if she accepted my renewed confidence and still had it in her heart to betray it in any way she had no right to let me commit myself to such a course The reply was simply You are right Doctor   Her appreciation of this proof of confidence was such that from this time forth there was no more reticence with me but she asked that none of her associates or nurses should know her secret The subject of suicide was practically dropped The analysis now to be given of the mental phenomena of the case was worked out and our relations remained upon this trustful basis for two years She became more cheerful and even hope ful By dint of hours of talking the earlier and later incidents of her mental history were made clear and such was her intelligence that it was possible to trace to its origin the train of evolution of her morbid ideation also to unify as parts of one process the strange and apparently incomprehensible events of her life Their consistency was also shown with a personal character of rare quality which she was not only unconscious of possessing but which she felt to be vicious not as a matter of delusion but from the intricate complication and confusion of her morbid intellection Above all it revealed the extent to which under the domination of a tyrannous imperative con ception the obscuration of such qualities of character can go and the pitiful havoc and unspeakable torment that can be created in a mind that remains intelligent and conscious of it all The interest of the case lies largely in the clearness of the differentiation it was possible to make between the earlier and later ideational elements that made up the psychological enigma In a characteristic way the earlier ones either disappeared 237COWLES or became obscured in the later complications and it is rare that their growth can be so clearly traced as in this instance The peculiar details already given are not so trivial as might appear but are valuable as representative of the mental qualities that are to be studied in this case The array of symptoms at first presented was quite typical of melancholia with suicidal impulse and such a diagnosis was justifiable but closer investigation made clear the distinctly idea tional character of the disorder as being  the insanity of fixed ideas in an advanced stage The plan of management of the case was to instruct the patient with a thorough understanding of the nature of her malady and how to set up a counter habit of motive and conduct she was urged to take a  new master the dictum of her physician as the antagonist of her  fixed idea The results of her first efforts to do this and of the study of the case will be given in the form of a mental history of the patient She left my care some time ago but the narration is given as of the present time During her early years from ten to twelve she remembers that she was sometimes depressed and had fears of harm even of death happening to herself or her relatives and with no reason for them The word trance  became painful to her because she had heard this and kindred subjects much talked about so that this word in particular suggested thoughts of herself or friends being buried alive In her twelfth year she was nervous and ill and in consequence was taken from school for six months She vaguely remembers having during these two years the fear of harm in connection with doubts as to whether some simple acts were right She had to repeat some such acts but she 238INSISTENT AND FIXED IDEAS had become quite well of these morbid experiences before the age of fourteen years In this year she survived a nearly fatal attack of typhoid fever and was a year or more in recovering from its consequences It was during this convalescence that for the first time she confided to her mother her worries and troubles It is necessary to make some allowance for her present disposition unduly to reproach herself but she thinks that at that time there were two promi nent features in her character that she was at times depressed and consciencesmitten and that she was always of a jealous disposition She believes she over came her reticence and revealed her feelings to her mother only because she was sick and weak The next year while still not strong she resumed attendance at school Being relatively backward she studied very hard but led in scholarship Her daily journey to school was fatiguing and there were irregularity of meals and study by night During this year men struation began The feelings of hesitation in per forming simple acts like those of three years before now reappeared In walking dressing or undressing for example she was obliged to repeat mal y such actions she did this however only when unobserved and then could not help it Here was the genesis of a common form of fixed ideasthe idea that the act performed is not right the accompanying vague fear that some harm will follow if it is not made right and the necessity of repeating the act to make it so From this point all the rest follows in its morbid train One of her schoolmates a distant relative was a girl of her own age called in this history C She was beautiful in person lovely in character and destined to exercise an extraordinary influence upon the after 239COWLE  life of the patient M The latter was the intellectual superior but became jealous she says of the attention C received although she admired and loved her very much M did not manifest this evil feeling in any way but it gradually developed to one of strong hatred or one that seemed to be such in her extreme conscien tiousness In connection with this feeling there were evolved thoughts of harmful things that might happen to C and then of selfcondemnation as if she were guilty of desiring them to happen This seems to have begun in the natural feelings common to all conscien tious persons M next questioned herself if she would not be tempted to do violence to C should there be an opportunity This became mixed with the repetition of her acts there was first a feeling of vague fear if she did not repeat them then there came to be asso ciated with the insistent idea a definite feeling of fear of harmful consequences to C if the morbid impulse of repetition were not obeyed then for a time this fear was dispelled by compelling herself to repeat the special act a certain number of times more or less on different occasions This fear of injuring C was harmonized with her socalled hatred of her as it was not so much because of the pain of contemplating possible harm to C as because of the suffering M feared would be inflicted upon herself by her offended conscience if any such harm as she thought of did happen to C It would be as if her thinking of harm in connection with C had made it happen to her and M were to blame for it Up to this point the morbid process had advanced through several stages of evolution and complication M realized all through this that she would not be even morally responsible perhaps should such harm happen but she went on all the same yield 240INSISTENT AND KFIxiU IDEAS ing to the domination of the morbid idea which her will was powerless to resist and fearing the self accusations of her conscienceboth the actual and the possible After this there came the appriehension that some thing would happen to C and Ms mind became tormented with thoughts of her own probable suffer ings from the blame of which she knew her conscience would accuse her She soon became unable to read or hear or think of any painful thing or of death as happening to any human being without feeling and fearing that it might happen and then was about to happen to C and mentally anticipating her own con sequent sufferings Thus these processes kept her mind full of painful feelings She found a way to allay them by forcing herself to think of some person known to her other than C whom she would mentally substitute for the latter and whom she would set up in her mind the moment the morbid idea came to be the recipient of the imagined or suggested harm This worked well for a while but soon began to be refined upon It became necessary to choose for the substituted person some one with many opposite characteristics to C for example there had to be a difference in age sometimes of sex initials of name color of eyes and hair stature distance as to residence from C and at last peculiar requirements as to time place etc etc to an endless extent Next it became necessary to have ready in mind a number of chosen persons two or three or four of whom as the case might be must be thought of in a certain order etc After a while thinking of these persons ceased to give mental relief and another set had to be chosen to wear out in turn The process was this if in reading or in conversation or in any way 241COWLES by direct suggestion or by the law of association of ideas the thought of personal harm to any one came into her mind the thought of C as suffering that harm came also Before the mental action thus interrupted could proceed she irust call up the mentally prepared substitutes and imagine them as possessed of all the prescribed characteristics and in the certain order etc as having the harmful thing thought of inflicted upon them This imagining relieved her but at last it became necessary to wish it to happen to them then by degrees to imprecate it upon them with increasing intensity of oaths and cursing although it shocked her very much She became very expert in this process of exorcising the fear the morbid idea would arouse she could go on directly with the conversation for example and keep up appearances Her pride in this regard her perfect concealment of this whole matter from every one was extraordinary and very characteristic of the malady It was only after six years of suffering and at the age of twentytwo that she first revealed something of it to her mother The process of relieving her mind of the painful idea when suggested in any way not connected with any acts of her own has been described On the other hand in regard to these the hesitating and repeating impulse also grew upon her and finally crept into all her acts It will be remembered that she feared they would cause some harm to C if not done right She could at first relieve herself from this state of doubting or hesitating in an act by exerting indirectly the inhibitory influence of selfcontrol over the morbid repetition impulse as for example by intellectually prescribing that she should repeat the partial or full accomplishment of the interrupted act a certain number 242INSISTENT AND FlXiCU IDEAS of times more or less on different occasions As this process became more complicated and difficult to con ceal her intense pride in maintaining appearances led to devices for abbreviation If she fell into a state of indecision in the attempted doing of any act and needed to compel action to avoid betrayal of herself she could succeed by strongly vowing that she would do it adding the stimulus of harm to C as the self imprecated penalty of failure of course this involved all the dreadful consequences to herself To reinforce this process also vowing became swearing and then came the necessity of the most fearful and blasphemous imprecations upon herself to compel herself to do or not to do certain acts then or thereafter upon pain of inflicting injury upon her friend and of all its dreadful consequences upon herself All this was sufficiently complicated but she regards these things as primary in the sequences of complication and mental entangle ment that were afterwards evolved These two things however have run through all the phases of the fifteen years existence of the malady the binding of her self over as she says by vows and oaths in a com plicated system of methodizing all her acts and the process of substituting vicarious sufferers of every harmful thing thought of in order to shield her friend and secondarily herself from the consequences of imaginary harm to her friend There was selfaccu sation however just as if she had maliciously wished the harm upon her friend But all this was her secret There was indeed a skeleton in her mental closet animated by the Satanic double of her own mind that tyrannized over her conscience and thoughts with a world of intricate formulae of thinking and doing She says she has lived two lives 243OOWLES The conditions so far described were quite fully developed when she was eighteen years of age She had become unable to study and then left school for two years she led a listless aimless life she says with loss of her natural inclination for reading acquiring accomplishments etc She maintained her social re lations in every way however and was sufficiently cheerful and spirited in manner except with members of her own family New complications were then evolved She began to be compelled to give up her dearest friends An innocent remark made by one of them might suggest the painful association of ideas in Ms mind or she might meet at a friends house some person against whom she had acquired an aversion through her morbid idea To be rid of the distress the painful memory would cause on meeting her friend or visiting her house again she must be rid of such friends thus one by one she had to avoid them Otherwise also the morbid idea brought in its train many others and these brought another set and so on in a widespreading combination the outcome of which would finally narrow down to imaginary harm to C If M tolerated her friend any longer and thus necessarily all the bad company of harmful ideas she felt that she became a party to the combination and thus subject to blame by her conscience under the compulsion of the tyrannizing idea The obstructive influence of the morbid association of ideas interfered with all the minor acts of her daily life It affected the taking of certain articles of food or going to certain places interdicted certain things or permitted them on certain days and not on others Colors pictures and ornaments were banished from her room She was fond of dress but certain materials 244INSISTENT AND FIiXEDi IDEAS and many colors could not be worn although she most liked them Certain days were tabooed for shopping because they were anniversaries of painful events in her morbid calendar and certain shops could not be entered When the new dress was obtained very likely it could not be worn because of some newly imagined danger of potential harm to her friend Thus it became more and more difficult to keep up appearances among her welldressed associates and retaining all of her pride in this regard she began to seclude herself Later this led to the neglectful personal habits before described Acts relating to all these things were complicated or prevented by her vow She would not reveal her troubles to her friends in fact was ashamed and afraid to do so Finally her relatives were made anxious by her peculiarities and after a scene she submitted to the visit of a physician who was told something of her physical condition She was taken away to the country and greatly improved in a short time But while there she heard of the death of a young neigh bor whom she had mentally used in the substitution process of wishing he might die to save her friend This was a great shock to her and she says that if she had deliberately killed the young man she could not have felt worse For a year after that her con dition was distressing she secluded herself became despondent and irritable A new phase of her mental condition now developed and there was a reaction from the unquestioning submission to her compulsive idea and the growth of the feeling of resentful desperation When about twenty years old she was again taken away to the country and without any warning as if the fates had willed it she was 245COWLES taken to visit at the home of her friend C where she spent three months It was a dreadful experience she felt that she must and did keep up appearances All her former admiration of her friends character and beauty revived but with it of course came the antagonizing jealousy and these opposing feelings went on together Her friend was lovely fortunate and happy she felt herself to be the contrary and managed to evolve the notion that her friend was somehow to blame for her own sufferings But again a pleasant conversation would dispel the evil feelings and she would wonder how such terrible things could exist in her mind She does not know how the thought of injuring her friend arose but the habit of mental vacillation between doing and not doing took up the thought and made her miserable She knew the place where a razor was kept She condemns herself un sparingly for all that followed but she sometimes thinks that she became involved in a mental obligation to put herself to the test of going as far as possible with the act of killing C and stopping just short of really wounding her One day in a room that suited the purpose she approached C from behind and drew the razor close across her throat greatly frightening her but M succeeded in laughing it off as a joke After this there was of course new and real cause for selfreproach and the feeling took possession of her that she was at heart a murderess and that this was the result of her former wicked selfindulgence Finally after a year of this worry she was forced to get a young friend to spend the night with her before whose throat when asleep she drew a razor This cancelled as it were the former act She spent the three years following the age of twenty with friends in various places being unwilling to 246INSISTENT AND FIXED IDEAS return home Matters secretly went from bad to worse with her and the hope of some outlet from her mental troubles grew less but she preserved appearances fairly well It was during this period that she made to her mother the partial confession already mentioned A sister died about whom she suffered great remorse because of some unkindness shown her a few years before and she confessed her feelings to an older sister This did her some good but soon all was as before During the next two years she gave up her social relations more and more ceased attending church making calls etc finally saw only two or three friends During these five years a number of the persons died whom she had used in the process of mental substitution for C this cut her off from her asso ciations if she had any with the families of those persons besides causing an increase of her unhappy feelings She did some reading was sometimes taken to places of amusement and could laugh and be com panionable but this was always hard She often wished that she might die but the idea of suicide never suggested itself except to excite wonder quite in a normal way that any one could have courage to commit the act There was always the love of life and longing for freedom from her troubles In the latter part of this period she remembers that sometimes when alone with a young old or weak person the thought would seize her that she could kill that person and that there was nothing to prevent it but her own weak will It did not grow to be an impulse to do the act it was only a thought of it The morbid mental operations before described still went on but became more systematized Among a number of strange 247OOWLE8 experiences at this time the following may be men tioned On one occasion in a public library she read in one of Dickens stories a graphic account of a murder by cutting the throat This affected her very painfully as if it described a crime of her own She had no peace till she went again to the library and from the same book had secretly torn the leaves upon which the murder was described and rended them into shreds Again she found in a newspaper an announce ment of the death of a person of the same name as C This so worked upon her mind that she had to select the name of a young lady friend and adding a letter to it to protect herself she wrote an obituary notice and had it published in the same paper This caused a great deal of talk but M held her peace On the principle of substitution this act relieved her mind of the suffering she had been enduring It had been just as if C had really died and by Ms own handor what was the same thing because of her own thoughts she cancelled the idea by the vicarious sacrifice of the other person This brings her history to the age of twentyfive years the time when her relatives recognized her morbid condition as was stated in the account first obtained By that time she had reduced herself to the practice of staying much at home and in her room She did not leave the house for ten months and again did not leave her room for a year She became very neglectful of personal care with all which that im plies At the beginning of this period she had much insomnia demanded and obtained sedative medicines These were increased in strength as they lost their effect till a narcotic mixture was furnished her which she took at will She would have it and did have 248INSISTENT AND rFLXD IDEAS it She took stimulants also It can only be learned that the medicine was given at the suggestion of the druggist who prepared it and was a preparation of valerian and other strong nervine remedies It was probably not so potent as she supposed but the family physician whom she utterly refused to see thought too much of it would be injurious She could not be induced to give it up because while taking it she had some peace of mind In fact it was the only way of peace for all concerned She was not thought to be insane Under its effect and that of stimulants she  could review and analyze with calm indifference to the suffering the mental operations of the past ten years It came clear to her she says that her con dition was one of insanity She called it a case of monomania and regarded the ideas associated with C as delusional She had a comfortable feeling of independence in regard to her conscience but if the influence of the medicine was not kept up the mental pain came back At the end of two years she had increased the medicine largely Then she also called her father to account for a conversation she thought she overheard which she found to be a hallucination and ascribed it to the medicine She readily recog nized it to be such and this is undoubtedly the only instance of the kind in her history This with the druggists repeated warnings of harm led to a strenu ous effort to stop the narcotic This made her angry an unusual event with her in a characteristic way she vowed she would take no more and stopped at once She was sent to the country with an intelligent companion where she spent a month with great bodily improvement She was perfectly correct in conduct and attracted much respectful attention Soon after this by her own desire she was placed under special 249COWLES treatment and what followed has been narrated In the first four months she gained physically in weight and otherwise Then came the affair of the laudanum and the diagnosis of insanity Immediately before this she had written a long and interesting letter to her home The physicians telegram to her relatives announcing her transfer to the asylum was followed by one from herself saying that she was well and telling them not to worry themselves The events of her first five months in the asylum have been described with sufficient detail including the incident which led to a free revelation of her mental history True to the characteristic habit of negation and antithesis her pride and reticence had long been accompanied by a fear lest she should betray her secret and then by an impulse to do so Both the fear and the impulse grew upon her But to detail her troubles to me soon came to be a great relief and comfort Thus was developed another characteristic of these casesthe desire for neverending repetition Once engaged in conversation with me there was no embarrassment in discussing the painful ideasno process of stopping for vows etc There was but little material change in her mental operations for the year and a half while the analysis of them which has been given was going on In general she was much more comfortable she said than before her long seclusion at home This period of comfort repre sents a remission of the malady which is another of its characteristics such remissions may last for months or even years She occupied her time very well in reading sewing limited however to a few articles etc Later she was able to have some bits of ornament or color in her room The morbid ideas continued oppres 250INSISTENT AND FIXED IDEAS sive but they were managed more methodically and readily than formerly She was continually having distressing experiences because of such circumstances as that the name of one nurse and the color of the eyes of another called up painful associations She preferred that my wishes should be made known to her as directions rather than as requests because she was thus saved from the difficulty always attending any voluntary action but the aid gained in this way never amounted to much Any act that was made a matter of my explicit command could only be obeyed through the system of vows she could not follow the advice to act under a new master as against the imperative idea The following description charac terizes her mental habits fairly well When she  came up against any question of doing or not doing some thing the thought of the act seemed instantly attended by a great crowd of associated ideas There was as it were a first series of things of which she had to think in a certain order because they were directly involved in some way with the contemplated act Then the first series involved another series and so on through a permutation of very diverse ideas narrowing at last to the one idea that through all this indirec tion the act would carry harm to C Then if strongly impelled to do the act as for example if she wished it or needed to maintain appearances before others etc she had to  bind herself over  in the way heretofore described to protect C from the possible harm It sometimes happened that after she had bound herself to do or not to do some act the contrary became imperative Then there was a dreadful process of countervows and binding over The associated assemblage of ideas varied for different acts and from 251COWLE  time to time When the ideas arose she had to run them all over in her mind in a recitative way always to the same central and final idea She became very expert at this and speed was acquired by methodizing the process and by practice so that she mentally touched the heads of things as she ran through the mental formula Yet strangely enough she could carry herself with perfect serenity and selfpossession in the eyes of all but her physicians It required a great deal of study and analysis to disentangle the thread of evolution of all these subtle and complicated phenomena She declared that she was then able to talk of them for the first time but that she could give only the most meagre idea of it all This writing itself is inadequate in representing what she did give She said  When I try to describe my years of trouble so many distressing thoughts come into my mind that I cannot prune my words of what is not essential She always declared that she had no conscience that no question of moral right or wrong influenced her that ceased long ago Her only criterion was to do as near her liking as was permitted by the tyranny of her controlling ideas She said that in her despera tion she did not hesitate in her thoughts to do any thing however wrong it might be if she desired it and she could accomplish it by her process of  bind ing herself over under penalties for not doing it In this way see could sometimes defy or rather evade the consequences of acts that at first seemed likely to be harmful She said if a duty came in conflict with the ruling ideas she yielded the duty but if a selfish inclination came up she could evade the harmful consequences She said also that she had long led two distinct lives one was entirely within herself 252INSISTENT AND FIXED IDEAS with its great complication of motives ideas and sug gestions and the other was a false pretense she was a walking hypocrisy possessed by an insane idea without any rightness of conscience or natural affec tion selfish and wicked and without repentance for many wrong and disgraceful acts intelligently com mitted She betrayed her real conscientiousness by be wailing the wickedness of her conduct She charged herself with misusing the system of vows which she thought should have been reserved for proper purposes of relief from her painful feelings when trying to do right things she misused a blessing she said in employing it to get indulgences for doing wrong But she made too much of the questions of right and wrong in regard to ordinary matters Her bewail ment however was more a matter of intellection than of depth of feeling the former was so forceful that it was accompanied by a large measure of the corres ponding feelings which she knew she ought to have under such circumstances were they real ones The depression of feelings was from a sense of oppression of ideas But through it all there was evidence that all of this was qualified by some consciousness of the fictitious character of that which dominated her mind In other words it was still true that were the domi nation removed and normal ideation made possible with relation to its limited disorder she would have been a well and happy woman In regard to abstract painful ideas not connected with any acts the like need of her special system continued Certain words always troubled her in her reading During the comfortable period of a year and a half now being described she became able to read quite freely until the last when it was almost impos 253COWLES sible The word murder was the worst and all others expressing acts of violence were almost as bad next came such words as  jealousy hatred malice sin and shame If when reading such a word appeared before her eyes there was instantly in her consciousness the crowd of associated ideas and along with them the thought of C as the object of the act or the subject of the feeling indicated by the word as if it were Ms own act or feeling Thus through some one of a multitude of chains of associated ideas the thought of harm to C was reached from the jealousy hatred or murderthought The effect of this had then to be annulled by the self imprecation of some penalty upon herself if harm did happen to C It appeared from this that the process of substitution of vicarious sufferers had been changed to one of selfimprecation after the time when she felt herself to be guilty of the deaths of the substitutes and had enacted the murder scenes To avoid the pain that the future deaths of such persons might cause she chose the new methodand it was as if she said on all these occasions Let me be punished as guilty of all those acts and the new harmful thoughts should anything happen to C This substitution of herself protected C then C being protected her own possible future remorse was warded off When in the presence of others this process might be dispatched quickly and unobserved or if reading it might be necessary for her to put the book away and go to her room and there walking agitatedly to and fro the whole process had to be gone over many times On many occasions at last she had to find the book and the word repeatedly and as many times begin anew Again the book must be taken to her room and there 254INSISTENT AND FiIXED IDEAS the reading of the word initiated a repetition of the process she must seek the word and repeat the pro cess many times There were so many special words and suggestions of painful ideas in innocent words that reading became too painful to be attempted In the constant mental conflict that was going on the negations of conduct frequently involved ques tions as to what she ought to do and ought not to do In this more comfortable period she once told me that a case like hers would be found in Mr Howellss last book She said Penelope Lapham had the same trouble I have but not a millionth part as bad and referred me to Penelopes struggle with her dilemma after Corey contrary to expectation had proposed to her instead of her sister much to her own mental dis tress Some time after this event Penelope said  Its easy enough being sensible for other people But when it comes to myself there I am Especially when I want to do what I oughtnt so much that it seems as if doing what I didnt want to do must be doing what I ought This saying and others like it were so true to nature as to make Penelopes case distinctly one of the insanity of doubting in one of its more common and milder forms but fortunately she re covered and this was by the logical process of the substitution of the more dominant idea strengthened by the deeper feeling During the latter part of this period she was allowed to go about alone in the neighborhood of the asylum  on parole No explicit promise was exacted how ever she was directed not to go beyond certain limits with a tacit obligation on her part not to do so She was better for this and the privilege was continued for a number of months after she entered upon the next period which is now to be described 255COWLES She afterward said of herself that a crisis seemed to come in her mental condition All the complications and agitations reached such a tangle of difficulties that she felt powerless to cope with them and seemed to come to a standstill She said that her conscience reasserted itself in a natural way and began to punish her for her wickedness by compelling her to do every thing contrary to her wishes There was now a real depth of feeling though morbid that she deserved punishment and her conscience seized upon every opportunity for inflicting mental pain this she felt to be simple justice At this point in the case there is to be recognized an exacerbation common in the course of such maladies but more than this there was now initiated a state that more nearly resembled true melancholiaan essential disorder of the feelings The gloom and despondency became more pronounced She had to make herself disagreeable and hateful to the people she liked the best and respected the most just because they were sources of comfort to her She said It is as if all the wrong things I have ever desperately allowed myself to do and think about now stand around me as creditors of my conscience A denial of everything pleasant or desirable was thus commanded She had to speak unkindly to her favorite nurse for example and then cried because she had been compelled to do what would make her appear ungrateful A change now came about in regard to her relations to me At first as has been said her revelations to me were satisfying and she had little of the temptation to tell her story to others which she formerly feared she might be compelled to do Her sole source of comfort was in such conversations but the need of 256INSISTENT AND FIXED IDEAS this grew upon her and at last it became impossible to give her time enough to satisfy her The temptation to tell others returned with the worry about it and in the end she yielded to it in some degree It also came about that she felt the comfort she gained from my visits should be forfeited as one of her punishments This became the prime issue in her struggle with her avenging conscience She fought it for months avoid ing meetings with me vowing she would never tell me another word of her troubles but just as often breaking her vows and talking freely whenever in my presence Her sufferings increased because these things involved harm to C and new penalties and only grew from bad to worse She began to say  I must go from here to avoid this suffering there is no other way The only hope I ever had has been here but this I must abandon anything is better than the suffering I endure here I must be deprived of my greatest blessing She felt that if she went away she must leave hope behind And so the culmination of this phase of the mental phenomena was gradually reached All this state of things was believed to be a passing phase of her malady and she was urged to hope that another remission would come She could possess herself of this while it was being told to her A curi ous thing came about at this time Not only was the comfort of hopeful words intensified to her but it was reinforced by telling her how foolish and absurd her mental performances were But true to the habit of growth of her morbid mentation there was need of greater emphasis in the telling to give her equal comfort At this time an interview usually ended by her saying Now before you go you know what I 257COWLES want you to tell metell me what you think of me It helps me to hold on to the idea what you say seems all real and true to me but it goes when you go and I am as helpless as before As the effect of this the kinship of human minds had an illustration My gentler characterizations became chidings and rebukes and at last denunciations which exhausted my polite vocabulary It was curious to observe the calm content with which these objurgations were received and a little startling to realize the personal comfort of such an unwonted outlet for sentiments that must be habit ually repressed Thus it came to pass that this poor patient brought it upon herself to be the vicarious object of stinging words which might have been more fitly spoken But now there came a climax in this pitiful history Like a law of mental habit the idea of vicarious atonement or substitution that had run all through all these phenomena from the first came into play again What was told her made her seek for hope though she could not have it It occurred to her that she might substitute physical for mental suffering some serious illness or great calamitysome personal injury that would stand in her mind as a lasting token of ample punishment then the demand for penalties would be satisfied and her mind would be left free to enjoy in peace the common comforts of life She invented a plan which bore some resemblance to her former suicidal scheme On taking a morning walk outside the asylum she procured a small pistol and late in the evening when her neighbor whom she did not wish to disturb was out of her room she shot her self in two places the shoulder and the hip making simply flesh wounds She was perfectly calm about 258INSISTENT AND FIXED IDEAS it and explained that she tried to wound the joints which she thought would cause permanently painful and crippling injuries She protested that she care fully avoided endangering her life for she had virtu ally pledged herself not to do that The wounds were trifling and soon healed her disappointment knew no bounds the last hope was gone as she felt her mental depression rapidly deepened in a kind and degree unknown before in death was her only relief she regretted the lost opportunity when she had the pistol There was now a condition like true melan cholia the suicidal impulse was pronounced and honestly declared She was of course closely watched Her former state continued and grew worse she punished her self in every wayin regard to taking food and in personal care etc She would stand in a fixed atti tude unable to move for a long time She contrived new ways of mental punishmentfor example another patient thought she had committed the un pardonable sin and M assuming this to be the worst of all sins imprecated upon herself the punishment whatever it might be due to that sin This idea however was so intangible to her that it failed to become embodied in her system of thought Even in her state of true melancholia there was yet something lacking of the profound feelings of depression and selfcondemnation characteristic of that state On a later occasion several attempts were made to hypnotize herto try the effect of therapeutic sug gestion She did her best to aid in this but was more amused than otherwise by her swift conclusion of its futility She said it never could be done the prime ob stacle being that she could ordinarily never go to sleep 259COWLES without having first cleared or exorcised from her mind all the thoughts of evil consequences which had attached themselves to the events of the day and to which she felt that she might perhaps not have done full justice The poor womans prayers even had been for years imprecatory She had at times piously prayed for help and strength but the thought of pos sible consolation from this source made such relief a subject of punitive deprivation moreover her dread ful misuse of the privilege of addressing the Deity de barred her from the proper use of it Another of her peculiar methods was in some respects not unlike the last There were times when she could gain herself a respite for a day by first binding herself over to do everything in the natural way for twentyfour hours and not to make any  vows She occasionally got a great deal of comfort from this device but at the end of the period she always had to review it and balance accounts in detail At last however after her con science had turned upon her there was an end to this expedient This history already a long one must be ended here In this Ms last and worst state it finally seemed best to try the effect of some change which she earnestly desired and she was transferred to another asylum She bore herself passively but with an evident feeling of regret and as if she had indeed left hope behind There was immediate improvement in manner and in the course of a few months her con dition became much more comfortable The change to new surroundings to which she felt indifferent was a great relief Freed from the oppression of the ques tionings as to talking with me she remembered help fully my explanations reasonings and advice A year 260INSISTENT AND IfIXED IDEAS later she was as well as I had ever seen her appearing very well intelligent and ladylike to all who knew her The secret mental processes went on however and though more submissive she had little hope She said her coming to meet me was opposed in her thoughts as formerly but in her strong desire for the interview there was no hesitation in determining to have it in spite of all consequences There were no preliminary vows but she knew she would have to pay for it afterward It was natural vivacious and most inter esting in the abundant proof it gave of mental integ rity aside from the limited derangement At its close she begged me in the old way to assure her that it was right to have seen me No definite information as to her subsequent history has come to my knowledge The details of this long story were corroborated in many ways by the agreement of their many repetitions when discussed from different points of approach Like most persons under the control of morbid ideation she was in the habit of saying to me  You would have a different opinion of these things if you could only know more about them they are so many and so complicated that they cannot be told Every new and often repeated analysis of the essential nature of her mental processes was readily understood and gladly accepted by her only to be followed by some new phase of ideation or memory of past trouble which would stand more positively in her consciousness than the clear explanation of it all which she con stantly tried and failed to apply This history may be briefly summed up The telling of the story is meant to show the natural and logical growth of complicated phenomena from the central morbid idea they depended upon this as the limbs 261COWLE  twigs and leaves hang upon a tree However distinct and strange any newly revealed product of her system of thought might seem to be its unity with the rest clearly appeared upon analysis The minor formulae of her mental operations were all more or less insistent or imperative strictly according to the closeness of association of the ideas with the central and ruling one and corresponding also to the degree of fixation of such methods of mentation by repetition practice and habit All these products of mental phenomena are explain able upon the basis of normal psychical law The problem of this case was to discover the genesis the growth and the fixation of the central idea which in this instance had the peculiarity of being unusually complicated In the first place there was probably no special hereditary influence in its origin the para noiac element is excluded certainly the right to infer it must be questioned If it be said to have been acquired because of the typhoid fever at the pub ertic period etc a neurasthenia must be admitted But if acquired organic defect be admitted alsowhile inquiry is excited as to the consistency of this inference it remains that the  fixed idea  was conceived some years before disappeared and was revived and devel oped when the supposable new factor of paranoiac defect came in1 But not only was the conservative There seems to be confusion and inconsistency in the meaning of terms used in the discussions of this sabject The terms psychosis and degenerative psychosis admirably characterize certain general notions of the mental states they represent but as definitions there is danger of their use as cloaks for conjecture Most writers hold that fixed ideas almost always have a neurasthenic basis this rates them as psychoses and functional But as ideational psychoses they lie in the foreground of primary systematized delusions typical of the admitted degeneracies in paranoia Hence the temptation to unify the view and to regard all the imperative conceptions as degenerative psychoses under cover of this term they are brought 262INSISTENT AND FIXED IDEAS tendency to maintain intellectual integrity significant so also was the absence of the characteristic habit of symbolism Paranoiacs are prone to symbolism whereby meanings are betokened by trivial things and delusional ideas are quickly conceivedfor ex ample the accidental placing of three apples in a row might be believed to represent the Holy Trinity For this reason there was a negative importance in the limitation of the strong disposition to substitute persons and things the one for another This did not bring out any innate tendency to symbolism as was likely to have happened had it existed There was into the category of paranoia But this term distinctly introduces among the psychoses the new notion of chronic hereditary or acquired defect in the organism Upon a foundation of heredity it is easy to conceive such organic defect to invoke a like foundation as acquired through a simple concurring neurasthenia has the vagueness of assumption and conjecture These therefore have really no support in the case of fixed ideas except the fact of the ideational origin of the latter and their kinship to paranoiac delusions But the clinical fact remains that their milder forms at least are commonly incident to healthy minds often independent of neuras thenia they make no trouble and fail of recognition because they are so little out of harmony with concurrent conditions Starting with these mild forms may they not be purely functional even along with neurasthenia for some degrees in the scale towards their culmination in the admitted degeneracies  The recognition of two general degrees of fixed ideas answering to psychoses and degen erative psychoses between which differentiation is as impossible as to mark the changes from youth to old age is not out of analogy with the same division that is claimed as necessary in describing delusions Cf pp 2278 The Journal of Mental Science for January 1888 received just as this article is going to press contains the conclusions p 532 of Professor Kovalewsky in an interesting article on Folie du Doute He recognizes several degrees and conditions of origin of these affec tions But he starts with neurasthenia as the common soil from which they spring belonging to the group of degenerative psychoses including pathophobia and the other forms of these ideational dis orders and neurasthenia itself is regarded as rarely acquired or other than purely hereditary in relation to these cases This fails to recognize the larger background in the normal field of intellection where the accidental and irregular coordinations of idea and feeling indulged or otherwise fixed by habit are the germs and often growths which are not degenerative but spring up more readily in soils of purely acquired neurasthenia or of hereditary degeneracies 263COWLES always validity in the factors of her mental equa tions the thing substituted was equivalent to the other in quality or effect and there was logic in the process At the root of the whole matter there was a bodily condition somewhat neurasthenic There was also an unusual intellectual endowment and rare conscien tiousness Upon the mental plasticity of childhood strong impressions were made by unpleasant ideas about trance and the horror of being buried alive Apprehensions for herself and relatives were engendered in this regard Here was a quick soil for the natural questionings as to the right and wrong of her conduct to grow to be questionings as to whether her acts were right in respect to their effect upon herself or those dear to her It was but a shade of change to conceive that her acts were not right in the sense of not being safe which includes the idea of harm as a consequence This is the usual significance of the phrase not right in these cases The at tendant fear of harm was natural and logical This combination of the idea and its attendant feeling once formulated the impression once made the idea became insistent  and then fixed and the path was formed by repetition and habit Here then was the fixed idea that some of her acts were not right which included the idea of harm This is a common and primitive form of fixed ideas it was the root of all that grew up afterwards Next followed the neces sity common in such cases of repeating acts to make them right which led to the doubting and hesitating over an act as to whether it was right or not and to the repeating doing and undoing of acts Thus is explained the paradoxical  doubting  associated with 264INSISTENT AND FIXED IDEAS fixed ideas Here next was the basis of the habi tual negations of thought and conductthe doing off set by undoing the balancing or cancelling of one thought or act by another thought or actthe substi tution of one thing for another From the rootidea that an act was not right came its larger growth and its offshoots intensifying the impression of the primary idea upon the organism This was further intensified by the feeling of fear normally attending the idea of harm the impression of the whole being deepened by habit its hold upon the soil being strengthened by its growth At the beginning before the age of twelve the seed of the malady was planted Its growth was arrested and she appeared to be well till three years later It might not have appeared again had it not been favored by physical debility A new growth began she repeated her acts to make them right She was relatively backward in her studies and had a natural desire to excel her companions which she did Her love of admiration and attention was perfectly natural as was her feeling of rivalry towards C whose unusual loveliness of character and person was more attractive than her own superiority of intellect Such was Madame de Staels lifelong envy of beautiful women Such thoughts and feelings are common enough among the young it was natural enough that her sensitive conscience should reproach her Thus with the mental habit already formed there was set up a selfinquisition as to her feeling toward her friend whom she was afraid of hating as she soon morbidly accused herself of actually doing It was but a step then to the thought of harmful things that might happen to her friend and but another to self 265COWLES condemnation for thinking of them as making her equally guilty as if wishing them to happen Of course there was exaggeration of feeling in this but so far in its development there was not necessarily anything that might not be common to many consci entious young people This idea of harm attending her acts and the accompanying feeling of fear readily became a concrete idea of harm to C and to this was added the conception of her remorse as a consequence of harm to C as if she had wished it This of course strengthened her specific fear of harm to C and rein forced the general idea of harm and therefore the impulse to repeat her acts Ultimately the question of harm to C attended all her acts This established the central idea and mental habit out of which came all its aftergrowth From this point the evolution of the mental phenomena was plain enough as given in the details of its history The need of repeating acts and  vows  many timesoften a definite number for the sake of emphasis was a manifestation which characterizes what is called the counting variety of cases of fixed ideas This did not become a promi nent feature of this case because it was left behind by larger complications The substitution process was most curious and constant but it was only an out growth of the primary fact in these cases of doubting balancing and offsetting one thing against another in an endless series of negations This process was also one of the remarkable devices for circumventing the dominating idea as if the characteristic paralysis of the will was limited in respect to that and the fixed idea stood as an irresistible intruder in her conscious ness while otherwise the will and the intellect were free to evade its control The murderacts were simply 266INSISTENT AND FIXED IDEAS dramatic as far as homicidal impulse was concerned They were extreme examples of what is common in such cases particularly in the metaphysical varietyan idea at first repulsive worries by its in sistence becomes involved in a process of negations and at last reasons itself into dominance Such tran sitions from one extreme to another of thought and feeling are but exaggerated examples of the law whose order we follow when We first endure then pity then embrace The kindred nature of the great variety of these affections is well indicated by the broad designation of insistent ideas as was suggested in the intro duction to this article These aberrations from the normal of wellbalanced ideation and feeling being once initiated may develop graver forms in cases of the more positively degenerative type because of para noiac heredity or acquired defect in other words when there is hereditary or acquired nervous and mental instability and such cases may more or less quickly develop primary delusional insanity The com monness of these affections in their milder forms as simply insistent ideas and their outgrowth from the ordinary and natural operations of the mind is a matter of great interest The commonest supersti tions and idiosyncrasies of formulations of ideas and feelings which control conduct and enforce habitudes are of this order in their slight departures from sound reasoning There may be many degrees of these affections before they are recognized as positive dis orders This view of their common origin can best be illustrated by a series of cases in which the early phenomena are more nearly within the range of observation But even the history of this case is not 267COWLES inconsistent with this view nor is it so as against that of their origin being usually constitutional For the same reasons it is hardly necessary to search the mysteries of the inconscient for the genesis of phenomena which admit a simpler explanation Many of these affections are to be easily understood as simply accidents or idiosyncrasies of ideation arising from an incongruous association of ideas happening according to the common law of contiguity and becoming fixed in proportion to the intensity of the impressions and by the laws of habit This may happen in a healthy brain bymental shock or by a slower process This case is an example of the operation of these laws in a plastic organism with the qualities of a sensitive con scientiousness and fertility of thought favoring the particular idiosyncrasy The morbid premise of the fixed idea being once established it had its own logical sequences The collateral ideation was normal enough and continued so for many years There was normal sensibility and feeling except in relation to the fixed ideas and their complications The will was domi nated only in respect to these and otherwise free and efficient The origin of these affections is distinctly ideational but they well illustrate the inseparable nature of thought and feeling especially when their genesis is favored by disordered states of feeling The laws of habit play a most important part in the fixation of such ideas and much is here to be learned of the nature of the great influence of habit in all forms of insanity These affections through the possibility of their com parative isolation permit the study of the formation of delusions Again the r61e of the attention is a leading one in these mental phenomena the attention is com 268INSISTENT AND FIXED IDEAS manded in proportion to the insistence of the ideas In extreme cases of this kind of limitation of the at tention there is side by side with it more or less activity of consciousness But it is in this direction that these mental states merge with those described as characteristic of the hypnotic state in its varying degrees of unconsciousness and of the  limited atten tion  peculiar to that state That condition character ized by Professor Stanley Halls phrase  tonic cramp of the attention is most strikingly shown in these affections The law of suggestion of ideas is active and even by autosuggestion the mental attitudes are induced so analogous to physical  cramp Also the relation of these attitudes to physical reactions is striking  A diffusive action in the nervous system accompanies all emotion  for example a common sequence is fixed idea fear pallor and heart disturb ance etc It seems in many cases as if the path between the ideation and the sympathetic nerve became so open and direct that there is the changed sequence of fixed idea heartquake and last the con scious fear At all events this last is swiftly over taken by the automatic organic attitude of fear and this quick reflex from the idea undoubtedly increases the fear The man is frightened by his own trem bling he is  a coward upon instinct This amounts to mental suggestion from the physical field just as when the hypnotized are put into bodily attitudes that suggest hallucinations Again the alliance of these mental states with some forms of hysteria is un doubted and explanatory of it The medicolegal importance of these conditions occupies a wide field this very case presents interesting features in this regard 269270 COWLES All these things show the unity of the great problem into which the clinical study of mental phenomena leads The propositions here advanced involve such important questions and more than these in the in vestigation of this subject and this case is interesting as presenting so much of the evidence that has led to these views

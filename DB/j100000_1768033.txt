j100000,Science,1768033,Health Matters,i300731,JUNE 6 1890 SCIE are full of sensational stories relating to the personal relations of the testatrix her husband and the responsible officers of the uni versity the one side attempting to justify the action of the will breakers by asserting injustice on the opposite side the other side defending the action of the university authorities The public are not concerned in that phase of the matter and the university authorities evidently feel themselves unaffected by the gossip of the newspapers Mr Sage a year ago began the erection of a great library building to be given the university as a memorial of the originally intending giver if the suit should be lost or to be paid for by her bequest should the university hold its own in the case He gives also 300000 as an endowment the income to be applied solely to the purchase of books Most colleges would be considered fortunate if given so much even failing to obtain a 2000000 library Practically the university gains it loses a million which it never possessed but it gains a positive quantity in the half million and over which is now actually passing into its possession It is the impression of some of its bestinformed friends that it will untimately actually gain through awakened sympathy and interest and the gifts likely to be the practical ex pression of that interest and sympathy more than the amount now seemingly so unfortunately lost It is very certain also that some of this scattered property will come directly back to the university by the action of the receivers of what they regard as unfairly acquired property This affair seems to have no effect on e plans of the univer sity authorities They will begin the next year with an enlarged teaching force new and distinguished professors in the faculty a 10000 equipment in illustrations of the work of classical in struction a new chemical laboratory to accommodate six hun dred a physical laboratory of double the space now occupied new workshops doubling the present area and capable of handling six hundred Sibley College men new mechanical laboratory arrange ments of nearly proportional extent a new foundery and new forge large enough to meet a similar growth and engines experimental and other boilers of 600 horsepower and dynamos more nu merous and powerful in the aggregate than can be found else where in the world All this looks very much as if Cornell University and the Sib ley College of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering were likely to survive for a time still HEALTH MATTERS Another Forty Days Fast SIGNOR Succi who is gaining the reputation of being a hun ger virtuoso completed in May a fast of forty days in London The medical journals of that city credit him with the genuine per formance of the feat Signor Succi has done no more than our own Tanner but he has been subjected to a more careful physio logical study and he has shown that a fortydays fast is possible to more than one human being During the last days of his fast Succi lost about half a pound a day his temperature remained normal but his pulse was more than ordinarily rapid The les son of Signor Succis experiment says the Medical Record is one that has often been taught before and it is that people eat too much and in this country at least drink too little More dis eases come from excessive and intemperate feeding than from al cohol for wrong feeding is the basis of gouty rheumatic diabetic and obese diatheses as well as of an infinite number of gastro intestinal ills Excision of Local Pulmonary Tuberculosis At the recent congress of the German Society for Surgery Pro fessor Tillmanns exhibited a man of about thitty years from whom he had removed a tubercular deposit involving a portion of the left lung pleura and thorax After the operation the lung contracted in such a manner that by a second operation the re maining tubercular area was completely removed The wound was covered with cutaneous flaps and healed completely and the patient is now able to work As the operation was performed about two years ago the cure may be regarded as permanent IN CL 345 Tillmanns thinks that the surgical treatment of pulmonary tu berculosis is proper if the disease is localized but that in most cases two operations will be requiredthe first to expose the affected part in order to bring about atrophy and contraction the second to remove the disease LETTERS TO THE EDITOR  Correspondents are requested to be as brief as possible The writers name is in all cases required as proof of good faith ThTe editor will be glad to publish any queries consonant with the character of the journal On request twenty copies of the number containing his communication will be furnished free to any correspondent Practical Applications of Meteorology IN the United States the making of weather predictions has been the chief use of meteorological observations for so long a time that few persons have taken the trouble to consider the manifold applications of this class of data In order to bring this matter to the notice of those who are interested in but not in formed on this practically very important question I have given below in a roughly systematic manner some few of the many points which should be taken into consideration in the framing of any future plans for extending the usefulness of meteorology in our country In order to show with any considerable degree of fulness the exact relation of meteorology to practical life it would be necessary to devote the space allowed for a magazine article to each one of the separate headings which I have assumed as conveniently and appropriately marking the subdivisions of the whole subject so that in the present paper only a few lines can be devoted to each topic This is mentioned in order to ex plain the omission of many points which could be readily sug gested as being of equal importance with those mentioned 1 AGRICULTUREWe have but to note the gradual change in the character of plantlife with the increase of latitude or alti tude in order to see what an allimportant factor climate is in marking the limits of individual plantgrowth Some plants re quire a preponderance of heat others of moisture and still others of sunlight in order to bring them to maturity Civilized nations have long since ceased relying on indigenous plants but in order to transplant successfully from one country to another it is necessary to know something of the climates of the two countries Meteorologists are constantly extending their network of observ ingstations and are thus reducing the areas the climates of which are unknown When the agricultural physicists shall have deter mined the climatic constants of all our useful plants it will be possible to foretell the successful or the probability of successful cultivation of any of these plants when we know the latitude longitude and altitude above sealevel of the place of planting We need better systems of estimating the condition of plant growth during the period from sprouting to ripening or harvest ing Reliable estimates of this kind would be a valuable crite rion for market prices of produce The usefulness of storm pre dictions frost warnings and coldwave predictions is so well established that we only take space to say that the nonfulfilment of the latter causes great loss to farmers who slaughter their own animals 2 COMMERCEIn dictating what can or shall not be grown in any particular country climate controls indirectly the nature of the articles carried from one country to another Merchants will not send articles intended for a hot climate to a cold climate and vice versa Still a great many sailingvessels are employed in trade and their navigators pay the strictest attention to the laws of winds which have been discovered to hold good for various quarters of the globe This knowledge often makes a saving of months in a long voyage Stormpredictions are of special im portance to our coast shipping and to fishermen but the recent inquiries instituted by the German Government show that storms must be predicted considerably in advance to render such fore casting of real use In shipping perishable produce it is of great importance to know whether damaging weather is likely to occur during the transit frosts being the principal danger which the shipper must guard against A meteorological record extending 1 Ir le

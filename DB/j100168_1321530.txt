CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS INCIDENT TO THE ACQUISITION AND GOVERNMENT BY THE UNITED STATES OF ISLAND TERRITORY ONE of the most important questions with which the Conven tion that framed the Constitution of the United States had to deal was that as to the disposition and government of the Western lands with which the new nation was to be endowed The Congress of the Confederation had undertaken to determine it for all time in I784 and again in I787 but by what authority Let us turn to the Federalist for an answer Madison there an swers very plainly and very truly that they had none After saying that the cessions of territory then made and which might reasonably be expected would place a mine of vast wealth in the hands of the new government he proceeds thus We may calculate therefore that a rich and fertile country of an area equal to the inhabited extent of the United States will soon become a national stock Congress having assumed the administration of this stock they have begun to render it productive Congress have under taken to do more they have proceeded to form new States to erect temporary governments to appoint officers for them and to prescribe the conditions on which such States shall be admitted into the confed eracy All this has been done and donewithout the least color of con stitutional authority 1 In the discussions of the constitutional convention there was a decided difference of opinion as to the measure of local self government to which the settlers on this frontier ground ought to be held entitled Some favored the policy of the Confederation by which certain fundamental principles were laid down as Articles of compact between the old States and the new territory Some were for admitting no new States on a footing of equality with the original thirteen The men of Vermont and of Franklin were a rough and turbulent set There were many who thought they needed to be held in check by a strong government The result was the adoption of a clause drafted with the diplo matic skill which was possessed in so rare a degree by Gouverneur Morris He meant it he tells us in two striking letters to which 1 Federalist No 38394 HAR VARD LA W RE VIE W Mr Justice Campbell called attention in the Dred Scott case to serve as a warrant to the new Congress to treat the Western terri tory and any other that we might acquire in the future as absolute sovereigns He contemplated as probable the ultimate inclusion of the whole continent of North America in the limits of the United States and possibly that we might reach out still further though it was a possibility that he deplored He meant to quote his words that as to all territory outside the original States we should govern them as provinces and allow them no voice in our councils In wording the third section of the fourth article I went as far as circumstances would permit to establish the exclusion Candor obliges me to add my belief that had it been more point edly expressed a strong opposition would have been made 1 This section it is important to remember is not put in that part of the Constitution which is specially concerned with the legisla tive department and in which most of the powers of Congress are particularly specified Each of the three great departments is made the subject of a separate article and then comes the fourth where are gathered together certain rules to govern the relations of the States to each other the character of their government and the privileges of their citizens The third section of this article begins with regulations as to the admission of new States into the Union and then follows the clause now especially under consideration which is that The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to Prejudice any Claims of the United States or of any particular State It is evident that this might not unfairly be understood to refer to the public lands mainly in their character as public property The phrase Territory or other Property certainly implies that Territory is to be considered as property Thus read Congress would deal with it as represent ing the owner rather than the sovereign In one of its opinions the Supreme Court of the United States seems to look at it from this point of view The term Territory it was remarked as here used is merely descriptive of one kind of property and is equivalent to the word lands 2 I Scott v Sandford i9 Howard 507 2 United States v Gratiot I4 Peters 526 527GOVERNMENT OF ISLAND TERRITORY 395 A broader scope however had plainly been given it in an earlier case while Chief Justice Marshall was on the bench He was called upon to decide first whether foreign territory could be acquired by the United States and then how when acquired it was to be held and governed These questions had a quarter of a century before been hotly disputed in the political department of the government they were to be hotly disputed again a quarter of a century later in the courts before his successors in office He had no difficulty in confirming as incident to the executive power what his great adversary in national politics who had recently passed away President Jefferson had at first hesitated to claim as a right the prerogative of acquiring new territory either by conquest or cession from a foreign power The legislative department had not shared in Jeffersons doubts The Louisiana purchase was a political event of far greater import ance to the country than any of those which have marked the year I898 It gave rise to animated discussion in both houses of Con gress but it may fairly be said that neither of the great parties of the day put in question the right of the President and Senate to make the treaty and so bring the vast territory which it embraced under the sovereignty of the United States The controverted points were first the policy of the measure and second the nature of the relation created between the inhabitants whose allegiance was transferred and the soil itself on the one hand and the United States on the other It was claimed by some in debate to bring them under the flag but not into the Union to make the people subjects rather than citizens and the land on which they dwelt the property of our government but no part properly speaking of the United States We could hold it they said and control it as a man can hold and control a farm which he has bought by right of pro prietorship to be kept or sold tilled or left fallow at pleasure it was in short a proper field for a strictly colonial government A few asserted that the United States could set up no laws anywhere that were not founded on the consent of the governed The question thus debated in the Fall of I803 was a practical and pressing one France had appointed in June a commissioner to deliver possession and was anxious to get the purchase money into her treasury The people who were the subject of the transfer 1 The debates are well summarized in Adams Hist of the United States ii Ioo I5396 HARVARD LAW REVIEW were uneasy and dissatisfied Expedition was necessary If in the presence of such conditions all political parties were in agreement as to the main doctrine to be applied the precedent as a record of legislative construction on a point of constitutional law is of all tLe more importance The Act of Congress of Oct 31 I803 passed by large majorities in each house to meet the case was a brief one It gave the Presi dent carte blanche He was authorized to take possession and occupy using such force as might be necessary to maintain the authority of the United States and calling out not exceeding 8occo of the State militia if he thought proper Then followed this plenary grant of general authority That until the expiration of the present session of congress unless provision for the temporary government of thesaid territories besooner made by congress all the military civil and judicial powers exercised by the officers of the existing government of the same shall be vested in such person and persons and shall be exercised in such manner as the President of the United States shall direct for maiintaining and protect ing the inhabitants of Louisiana in the free enjoyment of their liberty property and religion Jefferson immediately despatched commissioners to New Orleans to receive the surrender of possession and invested one of them Governor Claiborne of the Territory of Mississippi with all the powers theretofore exercised over the Louisiana territory by the Governor General and Intendant under the authority of Spain This made him a temporary king and constituted the system of government under which Louisiana remained until October of the following year The Governor General under the laws and usages of Spain had almost royal authority He promulgated ordinances which had the force of a statute He appointed and removed at pleasure commandants over each local subdivision of territory He presided over the highest court The Intendant however was a counter poise He was chief of the departments of Finance and Com merce He acted as a Comptroller General on whose warrant only could payments be made from the treasury2 He was also Judge of the courts of admiralty and exchequer Both these offices Jefferson put in the hands of one man I Public Documents 8th Congress An account of Louisiana being an Abstract of Documents in the Offices

examples was thus left to be administered or superseded and replaced by others for an uncertain period at the will of one man an agent of the executive power The Federalists in Congress while willing if not anxious that Louisiana should be governed as a colonial dependence objected to the passage of this Act on the ground that it set up a despotism incompatible with the Constitution The answer of the leaders of the party in power was that Congress had an authority in the terri tories which it had not in the States and that the United States were acting in the rightful capacity of sovereigns precisely as Spain and France had acted before them In the case decided by Chief Justice Marshall twentyfive years later to which allusion has already been made that of the Ameri can Insurance Company against Canter the counsel for the de fendant one of whom was Daniel Webster claimed in argument that the Constitution and laws of the United States did not extend over Florida upon its cession by Spain The usages of nations they said had never conceded to the inhabitants of either con quered or ceded territory a right to participate in the privileges of the Constitution of the country to which their allegiance had been transferred Congress might therefore govern them at its wil7 1 An Account of Louisiana c App xxviii 2 Ibid xlv 3 Ibid xlvi 4 Ibid lxxi 5 Ibid 38 B Adams Hist ii ii9 7 I Peters 533 538398 HAR VARD LA W RE VIE W The Court in its opinion went with them to a certain point but no farther Marshall declared that these inhabitants though made by the treaty of cession citizens of the United States acquired no right to share in political power and also that the provision of the Constitution that the judicial power of the United States should be vested in courts of a certain description did not apply to such courts as Congress had provided for Florida His argument on this the turningpoint of the case was hardly worthy of so great a judge The Constitution he said required that the Judges of the courts which it contemplated should hold office for good behavior The Act of Congress for the government of the Terri tory of Florida set up courts the Judges of which were to hold office only for four years Therefore the Constitution did not apply to them What were they then Legislative courts not exercising any of the judicial power conferred by the people in the grant made and defined in the third article of the Constitution but having a jurisdiction conferred by Congress in the execution of those general powers which that body possesses over the terri tories of the United States    In legislating for them Con gress exercises the combined powers of the general and of a State government The other legislative powers granted by the people so far at least as the express terms of the Constitution are concerned are either limited in scope or else confined to some narrow field of operation The right to regulate the territories so far as may be needful is given with no other definition of its bounds and who but Con gress is to say how far that need extends As to them Congress has and it was meant by Morris that it should have every power incident to an independent sovereignty unless limitations are to be read into the grant from its collocation and by force of the funda mental principles on which the whole Constitution rests or of certain of its general prohibitions and guaranties The judicial powers granted to the courts of the United States are carefully enumerated and cover comparatively few of the ordi nary controversies that become the subject of litigation Those which Congress can put in the hands of its deputies for the terri tories extend over the whole domain of jurisprudence The executive power of the United States alone stands as to the Territories on the same footing which it occupies as respects the 1 Scott v Sandford I9 Howard 507GO VERNMENT OF ISLAND TERRITORY 399 States Congress may create territorial offices but it cannot fil them Appointments must come from another source and so far at least as the leading positions are concerned are ineffectual until commissions are signed by the President Probably also he has a power of removal at will even of the judges2 Certainly he has a far greater prerogative Until Congress acts for the regulation of any particular territory which the United States may acquire the President is under the constitutional duty to see that the authority of the United States is recognized there and the peace of the United States maintained If the acquisition be by conquest its government falls to him from the first as the commanderinchief of the national forces If it be by treaty he must take possession and control it through such temporary agencies as he may think proper until Congress sees fit to act3 Whether there are any provisions in the Constitution or princi ples that underlie it which operate as partial restrictions upon the sovereign authority of Congress over the Territories is a question which has repeatedly been presented to the Supreme Court of the United States and to which its response has had a somewhat un certain sound In I850 in a case turning upon the effect of a terri torial statute of Florida the court spoke thus of territorial govern ments in general They are legislative governments and their courts legislative courts Congress in the exercise of its powers in the organization and govern ment of the territories combining the powers of both the Federal and State authorities There is but one system of government or of laws operating within their limits as neither is subject to the constitutional provisions in respect to State and Federal jurisdiction They are not organized under the Constitution nor subject to its complex distribution of the powers of government as the organic law but are the creations exclusively of the legislative department and subject to its supervision and control Whether or not there are provisions in that instrument which extend to and act upon these territorial governments it is not now material to examine 4 This opinion was delivered while political discussion was still rife as to whether Congress could prohibit slavery in the Territories 1 Constitution Article II Section 3 2 McAllister v United States 141 U S 174 178 Parsons v United States I67 U 5 324 333 3 Fleming v Page 9 Howard 602 Cross v Robinson i6 Howard I64 193 4 Benner v Porter 9 Howard 242400 HARVARD LAW REVIEW The Mexican war had stretched our boundaries to the Pacific The Wilmot proviso in I846 brought the question we are now con sidering into sharp and sudden prominence General Cass had been made the Democratic candidate for the Presidency in i848 in view and in no small part in consequence of an open letter to his political friends written the year before in which he told them that the right of Congress to regulate the territory and other prop erty of the United States would naturally be construed as merely designed to embrace property regulations that it had been pushed farther in practice by rather a violent implication but that it was a doubtful and invidious authority and  should be limited to the creation of proper governments for new countries acquired or settled and to the necessary provision for their eventual admis sion into the Union leaving in the meantime to the people in habiting them to regulate their internal concerns in their own way1 The question was a troublesome one for politicians as well as for jurists If the Missouri compromise of I820 was to be upheld it must be because Congress could rightfully legislate as to the domestic institutions of the Territories If it was to be broken through by the Wilmot proviso it was also because Congress had that power Some of the Whig leaders now took the ground that the power to legislate for Territories in this and all other matters existed but was rather one resting on implication than upon express grant John Davis of Massachusetts defended this doctrine in the Senate but said that the exercise of the power was to be controlled by the fundamental maxims of the Constitution Calhoun came nearly to the same position The needful rules and regulations clause he said conferred no governmental power whatever But the Constitution recognized slavery Slaves were therefore property so far as the United States were concerned The citizens of the United States were entitled to free access to every part of its un occupied territories They must be allowed to take their property with them A sovereign State might abolish slavery within its limits Into that State a slaveholder could not thereafter take this kind of property and hold it in possession But the Constitution shielded him in the Territories for they took their political 1 Leter of Dec 24 i847 to A 0 P NicholsonGOVERNMENT OF ISLAND TERRITORY 401 character solely from the United States and the Constitution was thLeir supreme law Daviss colleague was Daniel Webster He met the issue in the line of his argument at the bar before Marshall twenty years before by denying that the Constitution had any operation in the territories until Acts of Congress were made to enforce it it was made for the States and not for territorial possessions Benton took the same ground and maintained it in his Thirty Years View pub lished in i8561 Calhoun had at an earlier stage of the controversy in I848 in veighed in the Senate in most impressive terms against all meas ures looking to the acquisition of new territory to be governed as a political dependency and had introduced a resolution declaring that to conquer and hold Mexico either as a province or to in corporate it in the Union would be a departure from the settled policy of the government in conflict with its character and genius and in the end subversive of our free and popular institutions While the political anvil was so hot the Supreme Court wisely confined itself to disposing of the cases before them without pro nouncing upon academic questions however important Six years later however it adopted a different policy In the Dred Scott case Chief Justice Taney announced his adhesion and so far as he could committed the court to the doctrine advocated by Calhoun The needful rules and regulations clause he declared had no operation on territory acquired since the adoption of the Constitu tion Such territory was subject to such laws as Congress might enact as the legislative arm of the government but these must be confined within the limits assigned by the Constitution for the protection of person and property A power to rule it without re striction as a colony or dependent province would be inconsistent with the nature of our government Slaves might therefore be taken and held there because slavery was a status recognized by the Constitution2 The court as reconstituted during the civil war which the Dred Scott decision had done so much to produce or to accelerate re verted to the doctrine of Chief Justice Marshall and in I87I rein stated the needful rules and regulations clause as the primary authority for our territorial legislation3 The right of a sovereign 1 ii 714 2 Scott v Sandford I9 Howard 447 et seq 3 Clinton v Engelbrecht 13 Wallace 434 441 447402 HARVARD LAW REVIEW to rule his possessions in later decisions has also been relied on and has perhaps been most emphatically expressed in dealing with the various Acts of Congress passed to suppress polygamy in Utah The fullest statement of the present view of the court was given by Mr Justice Matthews in one of these Utah cases in which after saying that the question of the power of Congress to legislate for the Territories as to matters of domestic concern is no longer open for controversy the opinion proceeded thus It has passed beyond the stage of controversy into final judgment The people of the United States as sovereign owners of the National Territories have supreme power over them and their inhabitants In the exercise of this sovereign dominion they are represented by the govern ment of the United States to whom all the powers of government over that subject have been delegated subject only to such restrictions as are expressed in the Constitution or are necessarily implied in its terms or in the purposes and objects of the power itself for it may well be ad mitted in respect to this as to every power of society over its members that it is not absolute and unlimited But in ordaining government for the territories and the people who inhabit them all the discretion which belongs to legislative power is vested in Congress and that extends beyond all controversy to determining by law from time to time the form of the local government in a particular Territory and the qualifica tion of those who shall administer it It rests with Congress to say whether in a given case any of the people resident in the Territory shall participate in the election of its officers or the making of its laws and it may therefore take from them any right of suffrage it may previously have conferred or at any time modify or abridge it as it may deem ex pedient The right of local selfgovernment as known to our system as a constitutional franchise belongs under the Constitution to the States and to the people thereof by whom that Constitution was ordained and to whom by its terms all power not conferred by it upon the government of the United States was expressly reserved The personal and civil rights of the inhabitants of the Territories are secured to them as to other citizens by the principles of constitutional liberty which restrain all the agencies of government State and National their political rights are franchises which they hold as privileges in the legislative discretion of the Congress of the United States This doctrine was fully and for cibly declared by the Chief Justice delivering the opinion of the court in National Bank v County of Yankton IOI U S I29 See also Amer ican Ins Co v Canter i Pet 5ii United States v Gratiot I4 Pet 526 Cross v Harrison I6 How I64 Dred Scott v Sandford i9 How 393 If we concede that this discretion in Congress is limited by theGOVERNMENT OF ISLAND TERRITORY 403 obvious purposes for which it was conferred and that those purposes are satisfied by measures which prepare the people of the Territories to be come States in the Union still the conclusion cannot be avoided that the Act of Congress here in question is clearly within that justification For certainly no legislation can be supposed more wholesome and neces sary in the founding of a free selfgoverning commonwealth fit to take rank as one of the coordinate States of the Union than that which seeks to establish it on the basis of the idea of the family as consisting in and springing from the union for life of one man and one woman in the holy estate of matrimony the sure foundation of all that is stable and noble in our civilization the best guaranty of that reverent morality which is the source of all beneficent progress in social and political improvement And to this end no means are more directly and immediately suitable than those provided by this act which endeavors to withdraw all political in fluence from those who are practically hostile to its attainment 1 It will be remarked that the Dred Scott opinion is here cited as an authority Mr Justice Matthews statement of the law was quoted with approval in I889 by Mr Justice Bradley in deciding the greatest of all the Utah cases  that which held that Congress as representing the parens patrie of the territory could annul the charter of the Mormon Church confiscate its property and devote it to public uses He added however this important observation of his own Doubtless Congress in legislating for the Territories would be subject to those fundamental limitations in favor of personal rights which are formulated in the Constitution and its amendments but these limitations would exist rather by inference and the general spirit of the Constitution from which Congress derives all its powers than by any express and direct application of its provisions 2 It will be perceived that these few but pregnant words repeated later with approval in an Alaska case by Mr Justice Harlan3 sub stantially reaffirm a position on which the Dred Scott decision was rested by all the justices but three and from which none of the other three dissented4 This is that Congress in making rules for the Territories is subject to some or all of the restrictions and prohibitions imposed upon it by the Constitution as respects other legislation affecting person or property A difference is indeed Murphy v Ramsey II4 U S 44 45 2 Mormon Church v United States I36 U S I 42 44 58 67 3 McAllister v United States I4I U S I7  I88  Scott v Sandford I9 Howard 542 614404 HARVARD LAW REVIEW made in the mode of statement In I850 the court considered the letter as well as the spirit of the Constitution to have a con trolling force In I884 what is to be implied or derived from its spirit is treated as the main if not the only source of restraint This mode of expression may have been adopted in order to leave the way open to hold should occasion arise that the United States could not lawfully acquire territory to hold permanently or for an indefinite period as a dependent province or colony If however it means what it seems to declare and is of general application then the utterance of Taney on this point seems intrinsically en titled to the most respect That is in line with what Chief Justice Marshall said in the greatcase of Cohens against Virginia in dis cussing the not dissimilar power of Congress to legislate for the District of Columbia and meeting the objection that such legis lation had simply a local effect Congress he observed is not a local legislature but exercises this particular power like all its other powers in its high character as the legislature of the Union The American people thought it a necessary power and they con ferred it for their own benefit Being so conferred it carries with it all those incidental powers which are necessary to its complete and effectual execution Whether any particular law be designed to operate without the district or not depends on the words of that law If it be designed so to operate then the question whether the power so exercised be incidental to the power of exclusive legis lation and be warranted by the Constitution requires a considera tion of that instrument In such cases the Constitution and the law must be compared and construed Any other construction leaves the rights of the citizen too much at the will of the judiciary and ignores the natural meaning of our bill of rights2 The main privileges and immunities guaranteed by the amendments to the Constitution which serve that office are shared by every foreigner who may be found within our jurisdic tion3 They must then certainly be the heritage of every settled inhabitant of the land Such is their force in every organized Territory by Act of Congress Revised Statutes Section I89I and I believe it to be the same in every unorganized territory 1 6 Wheaton 264 2 See Pomeroy Constitutional Law  498 Cooley Principles of Constitutional Law 36 3 Wong Wing v United States 163 U S 228 238 239 242GOVERNMENT OF ISLAND TERRZTORY 405 which is subjected to civil government by virtue of the Con stitution itself1 If the laws of Congress as to the Territories are laws of the United States and subject in all respects to the Constitution of the United States how can we justify the long established practice of investing the Territorial legislatures with general legislative power Here again we may turn to Chief Justice Marshall for an answer The needful rules and regulations clause he said in McCulloch against Maryland2 authorizes the organization of a territorial government which constitutes a corporate body Pre cisely as a State may incorporate a city with its city council the United States may incorporate a Territory with a territorial council or a legislature The statutes of such a body will not be laws of the United States but laws of that part of it lying within the cor porate limits so far as Congress may have left the field open for their adoption They are like the laws of our chartered colonies before the Revolution Assuming then that the Constitution is the supreme law wher ever the flag of the Union floats over its soil are there any of its provisions which are likely to embarrass us in dealing with our new possessions  That they are islands and not part of the mainland of North America is of itself an immaterial circumstance so far as the right to acquire them is concerned Islands that fringe a conti nent are part of it Puerto Rico and Cuba are American islands3 Hawaii is in a position to command our coast and lies nearer to us than the outer Aleutian Island the acquisition of which has been oonfirmed by general acquiescence during thirty years For temporary commercial purposes indeed we have the warrant of the Supreme Court for saying that the President with the author ity of Congress can acquire any island however remote and make it while retained a part of the United States4 If there is any difficulty in our accepting the cession of the Philippines it is not that they are islands but that they are not appurtenant to the American continent 1 See Reynolds v United States 98 U S 145 154 I62 Thompson v Utah 170 U S 343 346 In re

Jones v United States 137 U S 202 212 221406 HARVARD LAW REVIEW Are we then  should the Spanish treaty be ratified  to meet any constitutional difficulty in holding and governing whatever it may bring us The XIV and XV Amendments must certainly prove a source of embarrassment The latter declares that the right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States on account of race or color By Section I992 of the Revised Statutes of the United States  all persons born in the United States and not subject to any foreign power excluding Indians not taxed are declared to be citizens of the United States This statute was passed on April 9 i866 by the same Congress which framed and on June i6 i866 proposed to the States for ratification the XIV Amendment with which therefore it may fairly be assumed to have been intended to be in harmony The first words of that Amendment are that all per sons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside If this stood alone and unexplained by contemporary legislation it might be argued that it applied only to persons residing in one of the States But read in the light of Revised Statutes Section I992 it would seem a more natural construction to treat it as adding to that the farther step to which the consent of the States was necessary that those thus born or naturalized if they then or afterwards resided in a State should be citizens of that State as well as of the United States It will be observed that the State among whose citizens they are thrust is not necessarily that of their birth It is any State in which citizens of the United States may at any time reside Whether therefore Revised Statutes Section I992 should be repealed or not the XIV Amendment would seem to make every child of whatever race born in any of our new territorial posses sions after they become part of the United States of parents who are among its inhabitants and subject to our jurisdiction a citizen of the United States from the moment of birth The Indian tribes on our own continent are held not to be subject to our jurisdiction in the sense in which those words are here employed They were until I87I Revised Statutes Section 2079 considered as separate nations with which we dealt as treaty powers Their present condi tion has been described by the Supreme Court of the United States I The Cherokee Nation v Georgia 5 Peters iGOVERNMENT OF ISLAND TERRITORY 407 as  a dependent condition a state of pupilage resembling that of a ward to his guardian 1 Can this same position be assigned to the Malays the Moros and the many savage tribes in the Philippines This will be a grave question for Congress and the courts to meet2 But however that may be decided the people of Puerto Rico and the natives of Hawaii will certainly be fully subject to our jurisdic tion Their children born after the ratification of the Spanish treaty if it should be ratified will all be citizens of the United States They must therefore by the XV Amendment have the same right of suffrage which may be conceded in those territories to white men of civilized races One generation of men is soon re placed by another and in the tropics more rapidly than with us In fifty years the bulk of the adult population of Puerto Rico Hawaii and the Philippines should these then form part of the United States will be claiming the benefit of the XV Amendment The provision in the first Article of the Constitution that all Duties Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States will also prove an awkward obstacle to any policy of the open door if our protective system is to be maintained It requires that any customs duties we may impose on imported goods shall be of one and the same form and at one and the same rate at every port of entry throughout the United States3 If there is a duty of forty per cent collectible on woollen cloth brought to New York from a foreign port the same percentage must be collected on woollen cloth brought to Manila from a foreign port subject only to any temporary reservations of a right to entry on more favorable terms which may be made in the treaty of cession On this point the Supreme Court of the United States had occa sion to speak soon after the Mexican war when California became ours by the treaty of peace and a contest arose over the right of the temporary government set up by the United States to exact duties on imported goods landed at San Francisco  By the ratifications of the treaty says the opinion  Cali fornia became a part of the United States And as there is nothing differently stipulated in the treaty with respect to com merce it became instantly bound and privileged by the laws which i Elk v Wilkins 112 U S 94 99 2 See United States v Kagama II8 U S 375 380 384 H3 Head Money Cases I 12U S 580 594408 HARVARD LAW REVIEW Congress had passed to raise a revenue from duties on imports and tonnage  It was contended by the importers that as Congress had not yet made San Francisco a port of entry or constituted any collection district in California the tariff law could not apply To this the court replied as follows Can any reason be given for the exemption of foreign goods from duty because they have not been entered and collected at a port of delivery The last became a part of the consumption of the country as well as the others They may be carried from the point of landing into collection districts within which duties have been paid upon the same kinds of goods thus entering by the retail sale of them into competition with such goods and with our own manufactures and the products of our own farmers and planters The right claimed to land foreign goods within the United States at any place out of a collection district if allowed would be a violation of that provision in the Constitution which enjoins that all duties imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States Indeed it must be very clear that no such right exists and that there was nothing in the condition of California to exempt importers of foreign goods into it from the payment of the same duties which were chargeable in the other ports of the United States As to the denial of the authority of the President to prevent the landing of foreign goods in the United States out of a collection district it can only be necessary to say if he did not do so it would be a neglect of his constitutional obligation to take care that the laws be carefully executed 2 Many other difficulties of a constitutional character must be en countered and more than can be noticed in the limits appropriate for an article like this I will note two which address themselves particularly to the consideration of the political departments of our government i The XIV Amendment declares that should any State abridge or deny the right of suffrage as to any of its adult male inhabitants who are citizens of the United States except for crime its repre sentation in Congress shall be correspondingly reduced This applies in terms only to the States but does it not state a constitutional principle that of manhood suffrage for every citizen which the spirit of this Amendment requires us to observe in dealing with our Territories Such would seem to have been its legislative construction in the Title of the Revised I Cross v Harrison 06 Howard 197 2 Cross v Harrison ii6 Howard 198GOVERNMENT OF ISLAND TERRITORY 409 Statutes relating to that subject Sections I859 i86o Can we properly leave the restriction upon the States and relieve Hawaii from its operation It is true that it has never been enforced against the States but it may be at the pleasure of Congress at ony time 2 An objection against the permanent incorporation of the Philip pines into the United States remains for consideration which if sound is insurmountable This nation is the United States of America That name was assumed on July 4 I776 by the Representatives of the United States of America in General Congress assembled who signed the Declaration of Independence The first Article of our first Constitution the Articles of Confederation is that The Stile of this Confederacy shall be The United States of America The preamble of our present Constitution states its adoption by the People of the United States in order to form a more perfect Union   and secure the Blessings of Liberty to themselves and their Posterity What they did was summarized at the close of the preamble It was to ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America The United States of America is a plural term The union of separate States in one political body does not extinguish their separate existence nor vary the force of their having formed this more perfect union in order to promote their several as well as their common interests Can the United States of America ever include a State erected on islands off the coast of Asia and having no possible tie of connection with the American continent I be lieve that to this a negative answer may be safely given Can they then annex such islands to a union into which they can never enter on equal terms This question cuts deeper than the one propounded to the Supreme Court of the United States in the Dred Scott case The opinion given there was that we could not acquire any American territory to hold permanently as a dependent province If that position be unsound it would not follow that islands appertaining to another continent could be so acquired and held To acquire of course is one thing and to keep another I believe we have unquestionable power to acquire the Philip pines as the spoils of war but a conqueror is not bound and may not be able to retain what he receives410 HARVARD LAW REVE W If we should be unable or unwilling to hold them permanently as a colonial dependence how could we get rid of such possessions It would seem logical to hold that the treatymaking branch of the government by which they were acquired could by similar proceedings convey them to some other power So far as a transfer of sovereignty is concerned it could not be accomplished otherwise unless successful revolt or other political change had made the Fil ipinos an independent people To make a grant there must be some one with whom to close the contract But it is the right of Congress to dispose of the territory of the United States considered in the character of property To sell or give away any part of the national domain reduces by so much the national resources As all measures to raise revenue must originate in the House of Representatives and to stop the revenues from any territory by its alienation would require raising more revenue by taxation it would seem proper if not necessary that the whole of Congress and not merely the President and Senate should concur in any measure that reduced the area of the republic Could such a reduction be made either through Congress by law or the President and Senate by treaty or both together if it took the shape of a gift to the Filipinos under which our ownership and sovereignty would pass to them as an independent power No authority for such a transaction is expressly given in the Consti tution If implied it would probably have to rest on the assump tion that the Philippines had proved a damnosa hereditas There would be greater difficulty in defending it on the ground that we had taken them as an act of humanity to spread the blessings of independent liberty over an oppressed people after we had elevated and educated them sufficiently to make them fit to use it aright For foreign missionary work of this kind in another continent our Constitution contains no provision The case of Cuba is of course far different That lies at our doors It has not been ceded to the United States Spain has re linquished her sovereignty but she has not transferred it to us Our position is to be that of a custodian or receiver The sovereignty is in effect in abeyance but it is to pass by our pledged consent to the Cuban people whenever they organize a government for themselves and show that they can maintain it and with it the peace and order to which Cuba has been so long a strangerGOVERNMENT OF ISLAND TERRITORY 411 Let me briefly summarize the conclusions which it would seem to me we must accept There is no constitutional objection to the acquisition of any or all of our new possessions or to subjecting them to a temporary government of military or colonial form There is no constitutional objection to our taking temporary possession of Cuba as a friend of the Cubans and maintaining peace and order by a military occupation under the President of the United States until such time as we may deem its people fit to govern themselves It is a practical application of the Monroe Doctrine in its modem form Until Congress acts the President can govern our new posses sions with no other authority than that with which his great office is clothed by the Constitution in its grant of executive power If the Spanish treaty should be ratified Congress could replace the temporary government which the President has set up in Puerto Rico by whatever form of administration it may think proper not inconsistent with the principles and provisions of the Constitution of the United States and maintain it until the inhab itants may be fit to govern themselves No fixed limit of time can be assigned for the duration of such a regime We have held Alaska under such conditions already for thirty years and she is hardly more deserving of autonomy now than when she was a Russian province We have held New Mexico under different forms of administration for nearly fifty years and the character and traditions and laws of a Latin race are still so deeply stamped upon her people and her institutiors that no demand of party exigency has been strong enough to secure her admission to the privilege of statehood Here as in so many other matters where constitutional law and legislative policy may come in conflict every presumption is to be made in favor of the good faith of Congress and the wise exercise of its discretion Upon the ratification of the treaty Puerto Rico would become and for the first time become a part of the United States but our customs laws would not have full operation there until Con gress created the necessary collection districts and ports of entry2 Until then the temporary government of the President would con 1 Leitensdorfer v WVebb 20 Howard I76 I78 2 Fleming v Page 9 Howard 602 6I6 6I7

continue in the discharge of their functions with the power of life and death And here such certainty as can be derived from judicial prece dent or settled legislative construction and popular acquiescence comes to an end Whether Puerto Rico can be held permanently and avowedly as a colonial dependence whether the Philippines could be held per manently whether with or without a view of ultimately dividing them into States to be admitted as such into the Union whether they could be given over to their inhabitants whether all trials for crimes committed there must be by jury whether Cuba which we have taken in the capacity of a friend or protector for the bene fit of its people through a war at the outset of which the public faith was pledged not to acquire it for ourselves by right of con quest could should we come at last to despair of their capacity for selfgovernment be kept as part of the territory of the United States whether in this republic there can be settled inhabitants of civilized or semicivilized races owing allegiance to the United States alone but who can be regarded as subjects and not citizens2 these are questions unsettled so far as we can consult the oracles of the past and in view of which the Senate must act in dealing with the great issue now presented to it as the executive council with which the States have surrounded the President to protect their interests against an undue exercise of executive power The last in the list however and not the least in importance while never adjudicated upon by the Supreme Court of the United States received an answer from one of its most illustrious Judges by way of an obiter dictum in the first great case in which the construction of the Constitution was involved This was Chis holm v Georgia in which the matter in issue was as to how far the ordinary immunity from suit belonging to a sovereign had been stripped from the States by the grant of judicial power to the United States Mr Justice Wilson in his opinion when discuss ing what sovereignty is had occasion to consider what is subject to it and used these words IJ ecker v Montgomerv I3 Howard 498 5I5 The Grapeshot 9 Wallace 129 i335

In this sense the term can receive no application for it has no object in the Constitution of the United States Under that Constitution there are citizens but no subjects Citizen of the United States Citizens of another State Citizens of different States A State or citizen thereof The term subject occurs indeed once in the instrument but to mark the contrast strongly the epithet foreign is prefixed In respect to the mode of trial for crimes committed in Puerto Rico and the Philippines should they be annexed and civil govern ment established there by Act of Congress I think it probable though not certain that a jury would be indispensable Article IV Section 2 declares expressly that  the Trial of all Crimes except in Cases of Impeachment shall be by Jury and this was clearly intended to embrace those committed outside of any State But this provision is contained in a section dealing exclusively with the subjects of judicial power particularly granted It is settled whether logically or illogically that the courts of Terri tories do not exercise the power thus conferred Congress finds its warrant for them in quite different parts of the Constitution and it is a sufficient warrant for investing them with jurisdiction over every kind of act against the peace of the United States which the laws of the United States may forbid True jurisdiction of similar extent may be and has been given under this particular section to the regular courts of the United States but the source of power under which the different tribunals act is different The source of power for the ordinary courts gives it with a limitation in favor of trial by jury The source of power for territorial courts might I think be read as giving it with no such limitation While this would give rather a strict construction to the constitutional guaranty it would be quite in line with that which the Supreme Court has as signed to other provisions hardly less important such as that secur ing the tenure of judicial office during good behavior The court however made a decision a few years since which tends strongly in the opposite direction A man was convicted of a misdemeanor in the police court of the District of Columbia upon a trial before the Judge after a demand for a jury had been refused He sought relief by a writ of habeas corpus from con finement under the sentence The Act of Congress passed under its authority to exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases what 1 2 Dallas 419 456414 HARVARD LA W REVIEW soever over the District which constituted the police court denied a jury in such proceedings The Supreme Court of the District had sustained the validity of this statute and refused to release the prisoner This judgment was reversed by the Supreme Court of the United States on the sole ground that he had a consti tutional right to a jury trial and their reasons were thus stated There is nothing in the history of the Constitution or of the original amendments to justify the assertion that the people of this District may be lawfully deprivwed of the benefit of any one of the constitutional guar antees of life liberty and property  especially of the privilege of trial by jury in criminal cases In the Draft of a Constitution reported by the Committee of Five on the 6th of August I787 in the convention which framed the Constitution the 4th section of article XI read that the trial of all criminal offences except in cases of impeachment shall be in the States where they shall be committed and shall be by jury I Elliotts Deb 2d ed 229 But that article was by unanimous vote amended so as to read The trial of all crimes except in cases of impeachment shall be by jury and such trial shall be held in the State where the said crimes shall have been committed but when not committed within any State then the trial shall be at such place or places as the legislature may direct Id 270 The object of thus amending the section Mr Madi son says was to provide for trial by jury of offences committed out of any State 3 Madison papers I44 In Reynolds v United States 98 U S 145 I54 it was taken for granted that the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution secured to the people of the Territories the right of trial by jury in criminal prosecutions and it had been previously held in Webster v Reid ii How 437 460 that the Seventh Amendment secured to them a like right in civil actions at common law We cannot think that the people of this District have in that regard less rights than those accorded to the people of the Territories of the United States I If the views thus expressed are not overruled and they were re affirmed with equal positiveness during the last year 2 they must lead to the conclusion that no conviction for crime could be had in any of our new possessions after the establishment there of an orderly civil government except upon a jury trfal I think also that by the ordinary rules of construction the provisions of the third fifth and eighth Amendments must be regarded in any form of territorial government which Congress may construct for any part of the United States including of course 1 Callan v Wilson 127 U S 540 550 2 Thompson v Utah 170 U S 343 346GOVERNMENT OF ISLAND TERRITORY 415 Puerto Rico and the Philippines should the pending treaty be ratified and if as I have taken for granted it cedes to us the sovereignty over both If not it must be on the theory that the guaranties which they afford to personal liberty refer only to proceedings had in the exercise of the judicial power of the United States To read them thus would seem to me to violate the ordinary rule that constitu tional provisions for the safety of the individual and the security of property should be favorably and liberally construed It would also lead to what I should say was the inadmissible assumption that the Amendments set up no checks against executive and legislative power2 The fourth amendment which guards the people against unreasonable arrests and general warrants was successfully invoked in an early case before Chief Justice Marshall arising in the Territory of Orleans General Wilkinson who was then in command of the army of the United States and superin tending the fortifications at New Orleans arrested two men impli cated in the Burr conspiracy and sent them on to Washington for trial There was a Territorial court at New Orleans before which they might have been prosecuted Arrived at Washington they applied for a writ of habeas corpus and were discharged by order of the Supreme Court of the United States mainly on the ground that they could only be prosecuted where their offence was com mitted and so that their arrest was unwarranted by the Constitu tion3 Judge Story in commenting on the decision remarks that as the arrests were made without any warrant from a civil magis trate they were in violation of the third amendment4 Our Constitution was made by a civilized and educated people It provides guaranties of personal security which seem ill adapted to the conditions of society that prevail in many parts of our new possessions To give the halfcivilized Moros of the Philippines or the ignorant and lawless brigands that infest Puerto Rico or even the ordinary Filipino of Manila the benefit of such immuni ties from the sharp and sudden justice or injustice which they have been hitherto accustomed to expect would of course be a serious obstacle to the maintenance there of an efficient government 1 Boyd v United States iI6 U S 6i6 2 State v Griswold 67 Conn 290 309 3 Ex parte

unknown to nations like Great Britain which are unfettered by legal restraints imposed by former generations It is part of the price it pays for liberty that new con ditions must be dealt with in fundamentals under old laws The people of the United States when they framed this Consti tution for themselves and their posterity had they contemplated a day when the Executive might negotiate a treaty of cession embrac ing an archipelago in the waters of Asia might have relaxed some of the restrictions which they were laying down to limit the legisla tive power They might also have strengthened and multiplied them They may now be asked to declare their will through the slow process of constitutional amendment but until they speak we must take the Constitution as it is Simeon E

WIGMORE  7080 The question asked as bearing upon the moral character of the defendant was incompetent But having been admitted it was competent for the defendant to introduce in rebuttal evidence of his good character Mowry v Smith 9 Allen 67 In the case last cited the court said To this extent it may be properly held that the latter corresponding to the plaintiff in principal case has waived the strict rule of law applicable to such evidence and is estopped from objecting to the proof of facts by the opposite party which can be properly deemed to be contradictory or in rebuttal of those offered by himself Accord Sisler v Shaffer 43 W Va 769 contra Phelps v Hunt 43 Conn I94 The interesting point in the principal case is that that which the defendant was allowed to re but was a mere imputation of immoral conduct conveyed in the incompetent question itself and that he was allowed so to do by introducing evidence of his general good character and not merely by showing that he was not guilty of the specific act imputed to him by the plaintiffs question EVIDENCEIMPEACHMENT OF HANDWRITING EXPERTIn an action against the indorsers of a note the only question involved was as to the genuineness of their signatures The court refused to allow the defendants to test the ability of one of the plaintiffs handwriting experts by submitting to him for identification both genuine and spurious signatures Held not to be error McArthur et al v itizens Bankl of Norfolk Va 1915 223 Fed I004 The court bases its holding upon the grounds of exercise of discretion and weight of authority In so exercising its discretion the court says No test of this sort had been suggested in connection with the testimony of any previous witness on either side    Assuming that the witness would have failed in one ormore instances to distinguish the true from the false the effect would have been negligible in view of the mass of testimony which had al ready been submitted Moreover if the defendant had been allowed to test the witness in this way the plaintiff could well have claimed the right to recall the defendants witnesses of the same class for the purpose of subjecting them to a like test and the trial would have been indefinitely prolonged Recogniz ing a discretion in the court to confine such a test within reasonable limits the arguments used by the court in attempting to justify its ruling as an exercise of discretion are anything but convincing It is hard to see how the failure to use this method of impeachment with regard to another witness would justify the court in refusing to permit its use with regard to this witness To state that in the event of a failure on the part of the expert to distinguish the true from the false the effect would have been negligible in view of the mass of material which had already been admitted is to state a non sequitur It is also rather violent to assume that to permit such a test to be made in any instance would prolong the trial indefinitely Nor is it at all clear that the law is well settled or even that the weight of authority is in accord with this holding As to the admission of spurious writings upon crossexamination to test the ability of the handwriting witness the courts have taken several different views Some courts hold that such a means of 77MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW impeachment may not be used when the witness is a nonexpert Loring v Warren County I Ky L Rep 340 People v Patrick I82 N Y 131 but that it is admissible when he is a handwriting expert Browning v Gosnell 9I Ia 448 Hoag v Wright 174 N Y 36 Still others hold that it is inadmissible in either case basing their holding upon the ground that comparisons may be made only with admittedly genuine signatures upon direct examination and that the same rule is applicable to crossexamination Gaunt v Harkness 53 Kan 405 Fourth National Bank of Fayetteville v McArthur 84 S E 39 ROGERS EXPERT TESTIMONY 2d ed p 342  144 In the light of the various views which different courts have taken of the subject it is difficult to determine where the weight of authority lies but reason and expediency would seem to be with those courts which permit the handwriting expert so to be impeached and against the holding in the principal case Hoag v Wright 174 N Y 36 GIFTSEXPECTANT ESTATE IN PERSONALTYWhere the owner of shares of stock gives a certificate for a number of these shares to a third person with instructions to deliver the same to his daughter only in case of his death held that such transaction creates an expectant estate in personal property Innes v Potter Minn 1915 153 N W 604 Under  3213 of MINN REV ST 1905 authorizing a freehold estate as well as chattels real to be created commencing at a future day deeds of real estate granted in the manner of the principal case have long been held to vest complete title in the grantee after the death of the grantor Haeg v Haeg 53 Minn 33 35 N W 114 Wicklund v Lindquist 102 Minn 34 113 N W 631 Dickson v Miller 124 Minn 346 I45 N W 112 In early times expectant estates in personalty were unknown because of such propertys changeability and comparative insignificance But the present trend of development both in England and the United States is toward a general recognition of future estates in personalty with an evident disregard for all prior imposed limitations and restrictions the estate being held good whether made by will or by deed and whether the goods or merely the use of the goods be given to the first legatee 2 KENT COM I3th Ed 352 353 and notes Longworthy v Chadwick 13 Conn 42 The principal case brings Minnesota into accord with what seems to be the settled law of most jurisdictions namely that the donor may create a valid expectant estate in personalty by gift made absolute by delivery to some third person the right of enjoyment in the donee being postponed until after the death of the donor Grand Trust and Savings Co v Tucker 49 Ind App 345 96 N E 487

waive the benefit of our homestead exemption as to this debt F E Nottingham James T Nottingham 0 E D Barron At the same time the parties to the note entered into the fol lowing agreement This agreement made and entered into in duplicate this 2nd day of July in the year 1905 between Charles F Hodgman party of the first part and F E Nottingham James T Notting ham and 0 E D Barron parties of the second part Whereas the said party of the first part has by deed of even date herewith sold and conveyed unto the parties of the second part thirteen lots of land set out and described in said deed for the price of 1190 of which 400 has been paid in cash and the balance of said purchase price to wit 790 is evidenced by the attached note And whereas it has been agreed by and between the said parties that the said sum of 790 is to be paid to the said parties of the first part out of the proceeds of the sale of the said thir teen lots of land as the same may be sold by thesaid parties of

ment of said note for 790 and hereto attached except and until sale may be made of said thirteen lots of land or anv part thereof but shall only demand payment of such and all sums as may be realized

error who instituted an action of debt on the note alone no reference being made in the declaration to the agreement The plaintiffs in error pleaded the general issue and tendered three special pleas the first and third of which were rejected Upon the trial of the cause the defendant in error offered in evidence the note without the agreement and rested The plain tiffs in error introduced the agreement in evidence Upon these writings and the other evidence before the jury there was a ver dict and judgment in favor of the defendant in error for the amount of the note sued on To that judgment this writ of error was awarded Numerous errors are assigned but in the view we take of the case it will be unnecessary to deal with them specifically The decision of the case turns upon the effect of the agreement of July 2 1905 upon the note sued on It is well settled by the decisions of this court that a writing indorsed on a bond at the time of its execution operating in favor of the obligor and signed by the obligee is to be considered as part of the condition of the bond Peyton v Harman 22 Grat 643 645 Smith v Spiller 10 Grat 318 Price v Kvle 9 Grat 247 Shermer v Beale 1 Wash 11 14 Gordon v Frazier 2 Wash 130 The case of Carter v Noland 86 Va 568 10 S E 605 6 L R A 693 in which it was held that to make a subsequent agreement respecting a bond a part thereof it must be so in grafted upon the bond that the original and ingrafted matter shall constitute inseparable parts of an entire instrument does not qtestion the correctness of the decisions of this court cited above but only held that the principles announced by them ought not to be extended to a case where the indorsement on the bond amounted to no more than a mere promise to refrain from the exercise of a matured right for a limited time The note sued on and the agreement to which it was attached were made at the same time and the latter in terms expressly declares that it was executed as part and parcel of the note It is clear therefore that the two writings together constitute the contract between the original parties to them and that the de fendant in error only acquired such rights by their indorsement and delivery to him as the payee in the note had The declara tions set out a contract to pay money on demand and absolutely when it was only payable on certain conditions To put that question in issue a special plea was not necessary The general issue nil debit did not and upon it there should have been a verdict for the defendants Newell v Maybury 3 Leigh 250 253 23 Am Dec 261 Smith v Spiller 10 Gratt 318 322 The 1907 51513 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER verdict of the jury in favor of the plaintiff should therefore have been set aside and a new trial awarded upon the motion of the defendant Whether or not detaching the note from the said agreement and bringing suit upon the note alone was such an alteration of the contract within the meaning of our decisions or Code 1904  2841a art 8 as would avoid the contract ought not to be considered by this court at this time That question was not raised in the trial court until after verdict upon motion for a new trial and in arrest of judgment when the plaintiff had no opportunity to explain the circumstances under which the alleged alteration was made It is unnecessary and might be improper to consider any of the other assignments of error as upon the next trial the issues and proof may and most probably will be different The judgment complained of must be reversed the verdict set aside and the cause remanded with leave to the plaintiff if he be so advised to amend his declaration and for a new trial Note It would seem that even though it was not recited on the face of the contract attached to the note that it was to be paid only upon the fulfillment of a certain condition extrinsic evidence might never theless have been introduced to show this collateral agreement For it is one of the exceptions to the general tule excluding parol evi dence that such evidence is admissible to connect two or more in struments evidencing the same transaction where the connection does not appear on their face See Tuley v Barton 79 Va 387 Pol lock v Glassel 2 Gratt 439 Brown on Parol Ev  50 says Where the instrument does not express the entire agreement and does not appear to express the entire agreement or there is a collateral agreement not embraced therein parol evidence is competent to show the omitted part whether contemporaneous or antecedent if it does not conflict with the instrument Johnson v Burns 39 W Va 658 20 S E

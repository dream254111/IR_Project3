Thomas Wilson of the Smithsonian has issued a number of reports in which he classifies and subdivides the multitudinous flint tools of the United States Aside from this and what has been done by Messrs Holmes Fowke Rau Ab bott and others the various museums and indi viduals have confined themselves to the chron icling of explorations rather than to the detailed study of objects Some of the more remarkable art specimens in copper clay and shell have been reported upon But I think it is no ex aggeration to say that museums direct their attention to the accumulation of vast stores of material This is apparent to archmeologists visiting any of the five larger museums I agree with Mr Douglass that too little attention is given towards the study of these interesting implements By comparison and a careful study of localities and the objects them selves much is to be learned I have begun several MSS upon ornamen tal and ceremonial stones and implements and utensils etc I shall be glad to have pho tographs drawings or descriptions together with observations and opinions from persons in terested in prehistoric archmeology I shall feel encouraged if a more serious study of stone bone shell and clay objects results from the undertaking although other observers may take exceptions to my views An exchange of cor respondence is desired WARREN K MOOREHEAD SARANAC LAKE N Y VOTES ON INORGANIC CHEMISTRY IN the Zeitschrift fur praktische Geologie H Oehmichen describes some recently discovered auriferous cobalt ores in the Kruis river dis trict in the Transvaal The ore which is found associated with diabase rocks is exclu sively smaltite with its decomposition products as erythrite and carries gold to the amount of about 60 grams per ton The gold seems to be ii the smaltite as no trace of free gold is found Five kilometers further west is another deposit of pockets of smaltite in a gold bear ing quartz the whole assaying 400 grams per N S VOL  X N256 ton Here ninety per cent of the gold is con tained in the smaltite These deposits promise to have a very considerable value THE subject of the distribution of the socalled rare metals continues to interest chemists and in the same journal is an extensive paper by J H L Vogt on the distribution of vanadium A very considerable portion of the paper is taken up by a review of Hillebrands paper published last year in the American Journal of Science on the same subject From Hillebrands investiga tions and his own Vogt concludes that the average amount of vanadium in the solid crust of the earth is between 00025o and 0005o Vanadium is thus decidedly less abundant than titanium which occurs to the extent of 03 0 phosphorus 009 manganese 0075 and sulfur 006 and also rarer than barium 003  zirconium 001002 o  and chromium 001 It falls near lithium strontium and nickel each of which occurs to the extent of about 0005 but is probably somewhat less abundant than these elements Still rarer elements are cerium and yttrium each less than 0001 cobalt 00005 and thorium 00001 Zinc and glucinum are somewhat less rare Vanadium is generally found in the basic eruptive rocks while columbium and tan talum which resemble it are found especially in granitic rocks The elements of Group VI show a similar condition for chromium is found in basic rocks while molybdenum tungsten and uranium are more generally associated with acidic rock masses It might be added that these occurrences are not unnatural inas much as vanadium and chromium are them selves much less positive than the elements of the same groups with higher atomic weight THERE is given in a recent number of the Oesterreichische Zeitschrift fur Berg und Hiutten wesen a description by E Priwoznik of the Austrian mint methods of parting platiniferous gold and silver The material is first digested with dilute nitric acid 1109 in which only a trace of platinum dissolves The residue is then treated with a somewhat diluted aqua regia in which the gold dissolves readily while the plat inum is only very slightly soluble When silver is present a coating of silver chloride is graduSCIENCE ally formed which impedes the solution of the gold In this case the silver chlorid coating must be from time to time dissolved off by ammonia The small amount of platinum in the gold solution is precipitated by sal ammo niac When much silver is present the alloy is fused with zinc and then treated with sulfuric acid before the above process THE atomic weight of palladium has been several times redetermined in the past few years but with results varying from 10575 to 10718 No cause has been discovered for these discrepancies The figure accepted by Clark is 10636 by Richards 1065 and by the German Committee 1060 Three new series are de scribed by W L Hardin in the Journal of the American ChemicalSociety in each case the compound used being one not hitherto used for atomic weight determination The palladium itself was most carefully purified The results are as follows Using diphenylpalladdiammo nium chlorid mean of seven determinations 107006 using diphenylpalladammonium bro mid mean of five 107036 using ammonium palladium bromid mean of four 10700 mean of all 107014 It will be seen that this figure is decidedly higher than that usually received it is however in close agreement with that ob tained by Keller and Smith 10718 as a mean of nine determinations by the use of pallad diammonium chlorid J L H CURRBNT NOTES ON METEOROLOGY INTERNATIONAL METEOROLOGICAL COMMITTEE AT the meeting of the International Meteor ological Committee held at St Petersburg September 27 1899 it was decided that the SubCommittee on Terrestrial Magnetism and Atmospheric Electricity should be maintained as a distinct organization under the direction of the International Committee The committee recommended that meteorological institutions should take part in observations of earthquake phenomena and in the matter of Antarctic ex ploration expressed the opinion that it is highly desirable 1 that the results of these explora tions should be completed by data from the observatories already existing in the Southern Hemisphere and by those made on board ves 779 sels traversing the southern oceans 2 that new meteorological stations should be estab lished in the southern part of the Antarctic regions and especially that magnetic observa tions should be organized 3 that magnetic determinations over the whole globe should be made simultaneously with those made during the expeditions The subjects of publishing tables of diurnal range of temperature for each country in a special form the importance of actinometric observations the multiplication of observations with the hair hygrometer in place of the wetbulb thermometer the laying of a cable between Iceland and Europe and the publication of an international periodical weather report to contain tendays means for about 100 stations were discussed but no definite action was taken regarding them It was decided that the International Committee and all the subcommittees should meet in Paris in 1900 immediately after the Meteorological Congress Nature of October 19th contains a brief account of the Proceedings at the September Meeting of the International Committee THE TEXAS FLOODS OF JUNE 27 TO JULY 15 A report on the flood in the Brazos river val ley Texas at the end of June and the begin ning of July last appears in the Monthly Weather Review for July issued September 22d The writer Dr I M Cline Local Forecast Official of the Weather Bureau at Galveston states that the heavy rains resulted from a semitrop ical storm which moved northward from the central portion of the Gulf of Mexico The storm was first noted on the morning Weather map of June 26th and moved inland during the night dying out as it advanced An anti cyclone moving southward from the northwest opposed the Gulf storm on June 2728 these being the pressure conditions which prevailed during the occurrence of the rains Two of the heaviest rains recorded during the 72 hours ending at 8 A M June 28th were as follows Alvin 727 ins Brazoria 783 ins During the 72 hours ending at 8 A M June 29th some of the heaviest rainfalls were Columbia 806 ins Danevang 1107 ins Rock Island 1015 ins and during the 72 hours ending at 8 A M June 30th Brenham had

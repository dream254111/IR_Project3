INTRODUCTORY ADDRESS BY THE CHAIRMAN 1 IN opening this session of our society and as an introduction to the subject of this evenings program I dare take the risk of making a few general remarks Our meetings have for object not only to bring before members facts and ideas but more specially to provoke discussions I consider a paper without a discussion as an unfinished program and I sincerely hope that the subject of tonight will lead to a lively exchange of ideas For us if we are worthy of the name of chemists our God means Truth and noth ing helps so much to correct our views and to arrive at the truth as an honest dis cussion Du choc des idees jaillit la lumiere  I believe that in our meetings we can go beyond the dictates of cold boresome uninteresting formality There is no de partment of science more closely inter woven with the welfare of humanity than our field of chemistry indeed many branches of chemistry have a very direct bearing on economics and sociology Every speaker who appears before us has the right to treat his subject in ac cordance with his own sincere convictions Anybody who speaks about explosives is naturally led to talk of their uses for defensive and aggressive purposes To deny a speaker this privilege would be as Delivered at the Chemists Club in New York City October 9             7 N S V   XXVIII No 728 unliberal as to forbid him to talk about alcoholicfermentation industries because the Prohibition Party thinks alcohol ought not to exist it would be as if a paper on the uses of saccharine was objected to by the Pure Food Law advocates or as if a discussion on the therapeutic value of chemicals was distasteful to the followers of Mrs Eddy it would be as unwarranted as if in a geological society a paper was considered as objectionable because it con tained statements contrary to the text of the Bible The chemistry of explosives has always been narrowly connected with the socalled art of war and it is almost impossible to talk broadly on one subject without touch ing upon the other I admit I consider this a very unfortu nate attitude of mind a sign of the yet very incomplete development of the human race yet to the average man this attitude is predominant For too many generations our race has been perverted by a per nicious education where writers and artists have glorified and misrepresented war We are all laboring under the harm which has been done by the socalled classic writers of antiquity whom I shall take the liberty of calling here the brag garts of antiquity for they it were who in their bombastic rhyme and prose made so much out of a little scrimmage between a handful of excited fighters as to make it appear as a feat worthy of the gods As long as the plastic little brains of our children are influenced by this class of literature so long will explosives and war go together Men like Grant Sherman Tolstoi Verestschagin men who have par ticipated in the horrors of war do not talk nor write nor paint the glorification of war If I kill a man and take what he has and what he was not willing to give me you will call it murder and theft but if some people kill and rob under association rules they will call it war and conquest There was a time when agriculture in dustry and commerce were considered of very scant importance because it was so much easier to get rich by conquering other nations and return triumphantly home laden with plunder and stained with blood but greeted with the applause of young and old The Romans and the Greeks and even the armies of Napoleon knew very well how to play this game successfully I am glad to say that since those times we have made some little progress Wars are no longer remunera tive except to army contractors and news papers Statistics show that nowadays it costs every warring nation about one mil lion a day to keep an army in the field Even then the results for the victor are about as disastrous as in a successful patent lawsuit where patentee and in fringer both lose money after they have paid for attorneys and chemical experts The financial crisis in Germany after the FrancoPrussian war the present poverty of Japan after two successful wars are striking instances of all this Nowadays people who want to get very rich have surer ways than those of plun der by war lawmakers and lawyers have given them easier opportunities for plun dering their fellowmen by the skillful use of socalled business methods and socalled honesty as defined by law Sure enough in the midst of all this live some dreamers who in their visions of the future behold the disappearance of war I admit I count myself amongst these vision aries these cranks these unorthodox un respectable people although I fear that our dreams are still far from complete realization Nevertheless the fact that some people dare dream such dreams and 818 SCIENCEDECEMBER 11 1908 dare dream them in public is already a very hopeful sign There was a time when even the most radical philosophers of Greece could not conceive a nation without chattel slaves and it is not so long ago that the question of slavery whenever touched upon in this country brought forth ridi cule and violent opposition The people of the United States by put ting in their waste baskets the old solemn formula of the Divine Right of Kings have done much to abolish war But this country did more by showing to other na tions that a great happy prosperous com monwealth can be built up quicker and surer by the power of higher ideals and of honest work than by war and conquest It is a current idea that to be prepared for war is to avert war This may be quite true but the main question remains to de termine what you call being prepared for war I very much believe that if we had had no navy we should never had had a war with Spain and we should not now be burdened with a Philippine Problem Let me remind you of the fact that there are 180000000 invested in our fleet that is now in the Pacific which costs the people of this republic a sum of money which would irrigate permanently 6000000 acres of arid land and transform it forever into a bountiful rich agricultural district that would provide permanent prosperous homes for 120000 families of good self respecting independent citizens It would build 60 to 100 great electric power plants It would utilize some of the natural re sources of this country make them avail able for transportation light heat and power to all citizens of this republic in stead of leaving them to be exploited for private gain Every battleship which now goes to the junk pile after a few years of parading costs a sum of money which would enable us to build equip and endow every time a splendid university or technical school that would rank with the very best of the worlds institutions and the benefits of which would be increasing and everlasting Yet I know there are many among my friends who believe that the surest way to avert war is to make it so horrible that no body dares to engage in it If the con servative military class had been left to themselves they probably would still be fighting with bows and arrows but scien tists and inventors have been encouraged to give them their support Whenever a new invention appears the question is raised immediately How can it be used in war Napoleons interest in Fultons ship was exclusively inspired by the possibility of using steamships in his war with Eng land Even nowadays balloons and flying machines receive their main encouragement from those who concentrate their attention on war and its engines Let me tell you that this attitude of mind is practically the same as if every time our friend Professor Bogert dis covers a new synthetic product with a neverending name somebody would come around and pay him to make a ripping and killing poison out of it The intervention of science and engi neering has not only made war more hor rible than before but has shorn away its picturesqueness which used to inspire the Don Quixotes whenever worms killed other worms Furthermore the gods of war no longer are influenced by the offerings or sacrifices or clamoring prayers of long robed priests They do not even take into consideration the socalled righteousness of the cause On the other hand they seem to have become very decidedly partial to the nation whose artillerists do not forget their logarithms during the heat of battle or whose explosives are best nitrated In SCIENCE 819N S VOL XXVIII No 728 stead of the bards of olden times who were paid by the warlords to sing their praise and to tell lies in prose and in rhyme we now have the modern newspaper But even if some newspapers are glad to have a war on hand which increases their cir culation they can no longer arouse en thusiasm since their war reporters with their deadly kodaks take away all the bom bast from their descriptions and only pic ture stern prosaic nasty reality Fortunately for us the study of explo sives and engines of war has a broader in terest In the same way as the deadliest of poisons have become some of the most valuable therapeutic agents so have ex plosives and engines of war found their most valuable applications in the arts of peace Nitrocellulose or guncotton one of the most violent explosives found im mediately its applications in surgery later on in the manufacture of celluloid and also made possible the photographic film Shall I call your attention to the splendid example of our fellow chemist Nobel who with his valuable work on nitroglycerine dynamite and similar explosives has made his discoveries and inventions incompar ably more useful in mining and in engi neering than in war and thus created more good than the harm they ever will do in the art of killing Noble too was one of those who did not love war and he showed it when after his useful life he made of his enormous but wellacquired fortune an international bequest for furthering peace and civilization Shall I remind you of the time when chemistry did not exist when the only en couragement which was given to experi mental research was dictated by greed that tried to make gold and thus bribed the skill of the alchemist And yet what an immense amount of knowledge was thus accumulated Knowledge which was afterwards utilized for the benefit of man kind Let me remind you also my friends and fellow chemists that our Godgiven mission is to utilize our science for the welfare of our whole race to develop and improve our knowledge our thoughts our aspirations to lead to a better a higher a happier race a race where individual selfishness and conceit shall not count a life by three score and ten but a race where an indi vidual and a nation are only considered as temporary cells or groups of cells in an everlasting organism that lives through centuries and aeons and which shall keep on improving and improving towards higher and higher standards unless igno rance gTeed and selfishness make it un happier and unhappier until finally it finds a fitful and merciful annihilation and perishes and follows the way of the dead races of animals and plants that have only left their traces on past geological periods and now proclaim to us that they were not apt not fit not warranted to perpetu ate themselves Gentlemen I now have the pleasure of introducing to you our distinguished fel low chemist Mr Hudson Maxim an American who by his discoveries his in ventions by his originality of thought and action has shown over and over again that he is most eminently qualified to treat the subject of this evening L H BAEKELAND THE WARFARE OF THE FUTURE1 How will the battles of the future be fought In our reasoning we are obliged to proceed from the simple to the complex from what we know to what we would Address before the New York Section of the American Chemical Society at the rooms of the Chemists Club 108 West 55th Street on

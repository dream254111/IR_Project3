the Pennsyl vania Register for I831 cf p 345 in which the nesting habits of the cliff swallow were de scribed This paper was also discussed Mr Taylor pointiug out that it was probably the first published observation on the cliff swallows nesting on barns showing that they must have changed their nesting places in that par ticular locality at about this time The meet ing then adjourned to meet at the residence of H R Taylor Alameda Cal July 9 1904 CHAS S THOMPSON Secretary The publication of a Catalogue or manual giving exchange valuations of nests and eggs while not strictly speaking a contribution to scientific knowledge perhaps is not without its interest and value particularly if the scale of relative valuations be worked out with care ful consideration of the abundance or rarity of a given species the question of a restricted range demand supply European importations recent explorations or the contrary and the numerous circumstances which must as far as is possible be reviewed in arriving at a judg ment somewhere nearly correct In this coun try where private collections are almost a necessity in many instances for advanced stu dents a Catalogue such as the one in con templation while it may always fall short necessarily of perfection is almost indispensi ble as a guide in the exchange of specimens while in general the prices indicated in the compendium may be said often to give con cretely and concisely a fair idea of the relative abundance of speciesat least of such as are readily obtainable Taylors Standard American Egg Catalogue is to be issued early in August with the A O U list to date and prices thor oughly revised with the assistance of prominent Oologists The active cooperation in this task which is in no sense a financial enterprise of all interested is asked and will be appreciated by H R TAYLOR Alameda Cal July 5 190o4

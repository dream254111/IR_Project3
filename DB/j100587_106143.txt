Vegetation By Mr Mustel of the Acad of Sciences at Rouen translated from the French MANY celebrated writers induced by the analogy which they ob served betwixt the vegetable and animal kingdoms have admitted the circulation of the sap in the one in a similar manner to the circulation of the blood in the other Read Jan 14 1773 This important point of vegetable aeconomy produced a diversity of opinions and has not yet been sufficiently cleared up Dr Hales in his Vegetable Staticks does not seem to embrace the system of the circulation of the sap but he does not prove the contrary   Il ne prouve pas contre This certainly is a mistake Dr Hales in the IVth Chapter of his Physical Staticks not only de clares openly against the doctrine of the circulation of the sap and overturns the arguments alledged in favour of this opi nion but he produces several new experiments which prove directly the impossibility of such a circulation See p 144 c His reasons have been thought so convincing that the system of the circulation in plants has been ever since exploded in England and that they have had a similar effect abroad appears from the following quotation from a book of the ingenious Mr Bonnet F R S of Geneva intitled Recherches sur lusage des feuilles printed in 1754 p 269  Pour moi persuade de la faussete de  cette opinion que la seve circuloit comme le sang par les ex  periences de M Hales Ch IV c M M Mr127 Mr DuHamel in his Physiology of Trees con tents himself with relating what has been said for or against this opinion but though he suf ficiently hints that he does not believe it true he determines nothing about it The friends of the circulation in plants have never been able to find in them any thing analogous to that powerful organ which is the promoter of it in animals for want of such an organ they were forced to imagine valves and paps in the lymphatick vessels of plants by means of which the liquors once introduced into the sap vessels were supposed to be hindered from going back but unfortunately no body has ever been able to discover these valves and paps so different from the simple contrivan ces by which nature is used to arrive at her ends An experiment which I made and of which I propose giving an account in this paper throws a great light upon this question as well as upon several others and the conclusions deducible from it appear to me decisive On the 12th of January I placed several shrubs in pots against the windows of my hothouse some within the house and others without it Through holes made for this purpose in the panes of glass I passed a branch of each of the shrubs so that those on the inside had a branch without and those on the outside one within after this I took care that the holes should be exactly closed and luted This inverse experiment I thought if followed closely could not fail affording suf ficient points of comparison to trace out the dif ferences by the observation of the effects The128 The 20th of January a week after this dispo sition all the branches that were in the hothouse began to disclose their buds In the beginning of February there appeared leaves and towards the end of it shoots of a considerable length which presented the young flowers A dwarf appletree and several rosetrees being submitted to the same experiment shewed the same appear ance then as they commonly put on in May in short all the branches which were within the hot house and consequently kept in the warm air were green at the end of February and had their shoots in great forwardness Very different were those parts of the same tree which were without and exposed to the cold None of these gave the least sign of vegetation and the frost which was intense at that time broke a rose pot placed on the outside and killed some of the branches of that very tree which on the inside was every day putting forth more and more shoots leaves and buds so that it was in full vegetation on one side whilst frozen on the other The continuance of the frost occasioned no change in any of the internal branches They all continued in a very brisk and verdant state as if they did not belong to the tree which on the outside appeared in the state of the greatest suffer ing On the 15th of March notwithstanding the severity of the season all was in full bloom The appletree had its root its stem and part of its branches in the hothouse These branches were covered with leaves and flowers but the branches of the same tree which were carried to the outside and exposed to the cold air did not in the least partake129 partake of the activity of the rest but were abso lutely in the same state which all trees are in during winter A rose tree in the same position shewed long shoots with leaves and buds it had even shot a vigorous branch upon its stalk whilst a branch which passed through to the outside had not begun to produce any thing but was in the same state with other rosetrees left in the ground This branch is four lines in diameter and eighteen inches high The rosetree on the outside was in the same state but one of its branches drawn through to the inside of the hothouse was covered with leaves and rosebuds It was not without asto nishment that I saw this branch shoot as briskly as the rosetree which was in the hothouse whose roots and stalk exposed as they were to the warm air ought it should seem to have made it get forwarder than a branch belonging to a tree whose roots trunk and all its other branches were at the very time frostnipt Not withstanding this the branch did not seem af fected by the state of its trunk but the action of the heat upon it produced the same effect as if the whole tree had been in the hothouse It would be useless to give an account of the diary I kept throughout the course of this in teresting experiment It may be sufficient to ob serve that the walk of nature was uniformly the same The interior branches continued their pro ductions in a regular manner and the external ones began theirs at the same time and in the same manner as they would have done had they been left in the ground The fruits of the in VOL LXIII S terior130 terior branches of the appletree were in the begin ning of May of the size of nutmegs whilst the blossoms but just began to shew themselves on the branches without I shewed Mr DuTillet of the Academy of Sciences at Paris on his passage through this town the effects of my experi ments and likewise communicated to him ano ther observation which chance occasioned and ought not to be omitted I observed that three of the flower buds of the appletree had been gnawed off by a snail in such a manner that all the petals and stamens had dis appeared being eat up close to the calyx This not having been entered by the snail the basis of the pistillum and the embryo were preserved I took it for granted that these flowers would bear nothing but I was soon convinced of my mistake Almost all of them bore fruit the ap ples were perfectly formed and six or seven pretty large ones too were seen upon each bunch On the other hand the snail had spared some other bunches doubtless because more difficult to be got at but out of ten or twelve flowers in each bunch not above one or two shewed any signs of fruit This suggested to me the idea that when the flowers of trees are full blown the pre vention of the natural fall of the petals and sta mens gives a greater assurance of the fructifica tion and on several times repeating the follow ing experiment I convinced myself that it did so In imitation of the snail I cut with my scissars the petals of apple pear plumb and cherry blossoms close to the calyx Almost every one of those which131 which were thus cut succeeded whilst several of the neighbouring flowers miscarried Thus did a snail teach me how to render a tree fruitful nor is it the first time that animals have been the instructors of mankind I confess how ever that this process is not very practicable in a large orchard but it might be adopted in an espalier in which one would chuse to procure a great deal of fruit from trees of the best sort It may indeed be questioned whether the suppres sion of the stamens would not render the fruit barren and in fact I found that though the flowers of the dwarf appletree whose petals and stamens were eat up by the snail gave me apples equally large and beautiful and that when I came to open them I found the capsules formed as usual at the center of them yet they were entirely empty without the least appearance of a pip Absolute fructification consequently did not take place since botanists with reason call nothing fruit but the seed which contains the germen which is to perpetuate the species All the other parts being only intended to cooperate in the formation and preservation of the seeds perish of course when once the seeds are come to maturity and perfection and the work of nature fulfilled Another remarkable thing in these apples is that in the upper part there was found a much deeper cavity than usual It was eight or nine lines deep The orifice of this cavity was bor dered by five tubercles indented and somewhat elevated but there was no vestige of the calyx which it is well known remains always to the S 2 upper132 upper part of apples and pears and is commonly called the eye I now return to my first experiment the con sequences of which as I have described them seem to prove I First that the circulation of the sap does not take place in plants as the circulation of the blood in animals This may be deduced from the following observations The tree in the hothouse went through all its changes during the winter and the branch ex posed to the open air underwent none conse quently the sap which was in action in the root stock and head of the tree did not circulate through the branch without which had no share in the vegetation of the roots and trunk It might indeed be argued that the cold air to which this branch was exposed stopped the circulation and therefore that the first experiment would not be decisive but the inverse of it seems fully so The tree placed on the outside of the hothouse continued during the whole winter in the state of numbness natural to all trees which are ex posed at that season but one of its branches which was in the hothouse put forth successively its buds leaves blossoms and fruits Whilst therefore the root of the tree to which this branch belonged was in the ground so frozen that the pot itself in which it stood was broken by it whilst the stock and top of the tree were so co vered over with ice that many of the branches were killed this branch alone did not in the least partake of the common state of numbness and suf fering and was on the contrary in full vegeta tion133 tion The sap in it must have been extremely rarefied and in very quick motion whilst that of the tree was greatly condensed and in total inaction How is it possible to conceive a circu lation of the sap from such a frozen root and stock to a branch full of vigour and loaded with leaves and flowers Surely this experiment must appear conclusive against the system of circulation since in this case it could at best only be admitted to have taken place in the vegetating branch and that would very improperly be termed circulation which should be confined to one limb II This experiment proves that each part of a tree is furnished with a sufficient quantity of sap to effect the first production of buds flowers and fruits There is little probability that the branch drawn into the hothouse should have de rived its sap from the roots of the tree as they at that time lay in a very small quantity of earth rendered extremely hard and dry by the frost they could have but little liquor to spare and even this considering the congealed state of the lymphatick vessels of the stock could have found no passage to the branch This branch must of course have been enabled to continue its vegeta tion by the quantity of sap with which it was provided the consumption of which must have been supplied at the first breaking of the frost This truth now demonstrable by experience had been pointed out before by a multiplicity of other facts Every body may have observed that a tree which has been blown down in autumn though se parated from its trunk begins the same vegetation that it would have done if it had remained stand ing134 ing Its buds open it bears leaves and even shoots which sometimes are very long and must be the effects of the sap it contained It is true indeed that this appearance does not continue long because the provision of sap once exhausted without being renewed every thing must of ne cessity perish An effect of the like kind often deceives us in trees that have been newly planted and in scions which produce flowers and even fruits without ever having taken root But in this case the symptoms which would seem to promise life are on the contrary the forerunners of death be cause the leaves being from their nature the most powerful organs of transpiration and dissipation the graft is the more readily exhausted when there is no root to furnish it with a fresh supply of nutritive juices III This experiment proves that it is heat which unfolds the leaves and produces the other parts of fructification in the branch exposed to its action Autumn is the time in which Nature employs itself as it were clandestinely under the cover of the leaves in forming the buds which contain the rudiments of the leaves blossoms and fruits that are to be produced in the course of the suc ceeding summer These buds prepare and work themselves out during the winter under the rough coats that are destined to preserve them from the injuries of the weather As soon as the warm weather in the spring begins to be felt the buds open and their coats which then become useless drop off and give place to the productions which they135 they contained and preserved Immediately after this the blossoms flowers and fruits make their appearance This is the usual operation but in the case before us nature was as it were sur prized by art what she should not have done till spring she did in the winter because the heat of the hothouse produced that expansion which according to the natural course ought to have been effected by the rays of the sun darting less obliquely than before upon the horizon There is no doubt but it is to heat either natural or ar tificial that this expansion is owing and the ex periment proves that it is only in that part of the tree which is exposed to the effect of heat that the sap which in every other part remains torpid and inactive is put into motion and pro duces vegetation From this it appears that the vegetable aeconomy is different from the animal and that those who endeavoured to establish the circulation in both carried their analogy too far This fact now established furnishes a good reason why in the tapping of the maple and sugar birchtrees so much liquor runs out on one side and none at all on the other It is well known that if during the time of a frost or a summers day towards noon you bore a hole on the side of the mapletree exposed to the south you will get a great quantity of liquor from it and that if you bore the northside at the same time you will not get a drop The cause of this evidently appears from what has been said One likewise sees why trees exposed to the south lose a great many of their branches and sometimes die alto gether in the course of a severe winter whilst  trees136 trees of the same sort but placed to the north or in some other exposition will stand the hardest frosts This is particularly remarkable in the evergreens whose resinous and oily sap being liquefied by the heat of the sun the tree cannot escape suffering a great deal whenever it is sur prized in that state by the night frosts Those observers who attend to this and know how well pines firs and bays succeed when planted on the back of mountains exposed to the north will take care not to place such kind of trees in a southern aspect in hopes of their succeeding better by it Many other consequences might be drawn from these experiments but the bounds I have as signed to this paper do not allow it I propose examining them more at large in a treatise upon vegetation which I hope the observations and experiments I have made may render interesting and useful XVI Actual

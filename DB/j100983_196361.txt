OF THE CONGO ADDRESS BY CHIEF JUSTICE DALY LLD President of the Society My annual addresses heretofore with a single exception have been devoted to an account of the geographical work of the worlda practice I should have continued but for the fact t thatthat work has now become so extensive and involves such a quantity of details that a complete yearly account of it would I fear prove too technical as well as too monotonous for a public address I have therefore chosen another subjectthe recent developments in Central Africa and the Valley of the Congoa subject of present interest which is not only geographical but it has also a commercial bearing At the establishment of this Society and for many years afterwards we placed at the head of our publications the maxim that Geographical exploration is commercial progress and it is in the spirit of that maxim that I have selected this subject for the geographical exploration that is now going on across the whole of Central Africa from the mouth of the Congo to the eastern coast will be followed by very important commercial results and already indicates the necessity of adopting such a policy now on the part of our Government as the nature of our future interests and that of other maritime nations may demand The subject was recently before the Chamber of Com merce in this city I was invited to address the Chamber upon it and being desirous of pointing out the impor90 Recent Developments in Central Africa tance of our future relations with Central Africa and the interest to us of what is now going on there I felt as I then expressed myself very much like one rising in a body of merchants in London about the year 1621 to impress upon them the importance of a settlement that had just then been made on the coast of North America at a place called Plymouth who had he suggested the possi bility that that infant settlement in connection with those previously made upon the Island of Manhattan and at Jamestown might in less than 250 years increase to a great nation of 50000000 of people he would probably have been regarded as a fit subject for an institution which a few years before had been established in London called Bedlam In addressing the Chamber of Commerce therefore upon the importance to this country and other maritime nations of what has taken place in Central Africa within the past few years in the region of the Congo I invoked the benefit of this illustration if what I said to them of our interest in this newly developing part of the world appeared to them somewhat ideal or extravagant The same precau tion may not be necessary before a body of geographers but nevertheless I invoke the benefit here also of this illustration and that what I have to say may be more readily understood permit me to open the subject by a few remarks upon the condition of Africa in the past It is a striking fact that although Africa was the seat of the earliest civilization known to usthat of Egyptand although one of the greatest commercial nations of antiquity flourished upon its northern shoresthe Carthagenians it is of all the continents the one that has made the least progress in civilization There has been however a satisand the Valley of the Congo factory reason for this Although Africa has a long and a continuous line of coastfor it is almost an island being separated from Asia only by the narrow Isthmus through which the Suez Canal has been cutit is throughout the whole of its coast line so poorly provided with bays har bors and navigable rivers that it has remained for centuries practically isolated The want of deeply penetrating inlets from the sea and of good navigable rivers flowing from the interior to the ocean has prevented the great bulk of the vast population of that Continent estimated at the present day by statisticians at more than 200000000 or double that of America from having intercourse with the civilized nations of the world and consequently up to a compara tively recent period a large portion of the interior of this great Continent which is more than three times as large as Europe has remained wholly unknown The contrast which our own country presents in this respect will illustrate why it has been rapidly settled since its discovery less than four centuries ago whilst Africa during the same period has remained almost stationary To limit the illustration to the Atlantic border of the United States alone we have flowing into the sea from the Bay of Fundy to the western extremity of the Gulf of Mexico no less than 105 rivers together with numerous bays harbors and penetrating inlets from the ocean Many of those rivers are navigable far into the interior and some of them are of great length serving as water arteries over the whole country from East to West and from North to South facilitating intercourse and the transportation of merchandise to nearly every part of it The physical geography of Africa is the reverse of this It has as we know from the researches of the past few 9192 Recent Developmnents in Central Africa years a somewhat extensive water system of great lakes and large rivers but the navigation of nearly all its rivers is impeded by cataracts rapids and other obstructions which prevent thenl from serving as waterways into the interior All the rivers on the east coast on the Indian ocean from Cape Corientes about the 24th parallel of south latitude to the upper part of the Red sea and on the Atlan tic from the tropic of Capricorn to the Bight of Benin are obstructed in this way preventing traffic by water from the coast inward for any considerable distance But in addition to this other causes have contributed to the isolation of this great continent The Egyptian and Carthagenian civilization which grew up upon the shores of the Mediterranean could not pene trate far southward because the vast Sahara Libian and Nubian deserts which stretch from the Atlantic to the Red sea prevented communication in this direction with the rest of Africa Nor could the countries along the coast be successfully settled as the United States seaboard was because both on the East and on the West Coast for nearly a hundred miles inward from the sea there is a malarious belt which is not only injurious to the health of the white races but even the natives of the interior when they settle upon it undergo physical degradation The Portuguese who were the discoverers settled upon the eastern and western coasts and still retain their settle ments in certain parts But during the four centuries that have intervened they have accomplished little for the per manent benefit of Africa They introduced the sugar cane the vine and some other productions and a few Portu guese explorers within the past two centuries have trav ersed the interior to the mouth of the Zambesi on the Eastand the Valley of the Congo Coast and as far northward as the great equatorial lakes but the world learned little of the information they may have gathered and their journeys or explorations had no permanent effect in advancing the civilization of Africa In the early settlement of the Western Coast and espec ially after the discovery of the Congo with the importance of which at the time the Portuguese were much impressed they made great efforts They extended their commercial operations far into the interior erected chains of forts for the protection of their settlements and built many cathedrals churches monasteries and colleges in an earnest effort to Christianize and civilize the natives All this however was followed by no permanent results and their colonial estab lishments gradually sank into decay from two causesthe slave trade and the superior advantages of Brazil as a colonial settlement Some of their establishments they abandoned altogether and in those which they have kept up but little progress has been made The Portuguese have been the chief supporters of the slave trade they were in 1503 the first to begin it and they have been the last to adhere to it It continued on the West Coast until 1868 only sixteen years ago and was then formally abandoned by them only because they were compelled by the cruisers of the civilized nations of the world to give up this infamous traffic To support it raids had to be made farther and farther into the interior and wherever the slavetrader goes in Africa the country becomes a wilderness Their idea of religion in connection with this traffic when we think of the barbarities attending the capture of the slaves the manner in which they were transported to the coast and the horrors of the middle passage may be illus 9394 Recent Developments in Central Africa trated by a circumstance mentioned by Monteiro one of the most recent writers upon the Portuguese possessions on the West Coast To within a very few years he says there existed a marble armchair on the wharf at the Custom House at Loanda where the bishop in the slavetrading times was wont to sit to baptize and bless the batches of poor wretches as they were sent off in bargeloads to the ves sels in the harbor  Instead therefore of advancing they have retarded civilization Jacob Bright said of them in the British Parliament when the question of their claim to the Lower Congo was under consideration that their presence on the African Continent had been every where and always a curse Lord Mayo who has visited the West Coast in his condemnation of them is equally expressive declaring in a recent publication that their rule and exactions bring to all parts of this vast conti nent misery and slavery wherever they put their heel down It must however be said in justice to the Portuguese that they had a great deal to contend with in the climate of the West Coast that they have been in their African colonies generally hospitable to strangers and kind masters to the Africans there who were about them treat ing them not only with kindness but even equality in which respect they differ very much from their neighbors the Dutch of South Africa who have been hard masters exacting from the negro the largest amount of labor for the smallest amount of remuneration The merit of the Dutch however in South Africa is that they have developed the country because they became per Monteiros Angola vol I p 68and the Valley of the Congo manent agricultural settlers and whatever has been done for South Africa in Cape Colony in Natal in the Orange Free State and in the Transvaal has been done by the Boers as the descendants of the Dutch are called The English who rule over a large part of South Africa since they acquired possession of the country at and about the Cape of Good Hope at the beginning of the present century have not as a race been settlers but generally adventurers who have gone there for what they could bring awaya class of little value to any country This ladies and gentlemen is a brief statement of what Africa has been Those present of my own age will recall that when we were young the centre of this great continent was a blank upon the map The term of The Dark Conti nent  was applied to it as expressive alike of the races that dwelt there and of our total ignorance then respecting it This is a map of Africa published in this city by Burr about half a century ago Upon it from the Bight of Biaffra in the Gulf of Guinea and just about the equator there is rep resented as stretching nearly across the whole of the Con tinent a lofty range of imaginary mountains very appro priately called The Mountains of Moon and all below this in the interior to Cape Colony on the thirtieth parallel of south latitude is marked unexplored region If you look at this map published by Stanford in 1877 and this one of Central Africa published last year by Dr A Chavanne of Vienna you will see how extensive and even minute our information is now over a very large part of this region During the first half of the present century there was considerable exploration in North Africa especially up the Nile and in that part of Western Africa lying between 9596 Recent Developments in Central Africa the Sahara and the Gulf of Guinea through which the Niger flows But the great work has been done during the last quarter of a century by a series of journeys and explor ations over the whole continent which has resulted in more knowledge respecting it than had been ascertained for centuries previously This has embraced the explorations in the north and through the deserts by Barth Nachtigal Rohlfs and Schweinfurth In Central Africa the journeys and explorations for thirty years of Livingston 18431873 from Cape Colony to near the equator and from the Indian ocean to the Atlantic comprising about onethird of the whole continent which made known the great water system of lakes and rivers that exist below the equator Du Chaillus journeys of 8000 miles from the West Coast in the region of the equator 1856 and 1865 Burton Speke Grant and Bakers discoveries 18581864 or rather re discovery of the three great lakes Tanganyka Ukerewe and Mwutan and the fact that the last two which the English call the Victoria and Albert Nyanzas where the long sought sources of the Nile The journey of Commander Cameron across the whole continent 18731875 from Zanzibar on the east to Benguela on the West Coast and the reverse journey across it by a Portuguese explorer Major Serpa Pinto 18771878 from Benguela to the Transvaal and Durban Stanleys exploration of the Congo 1877 from Nyangwe to its mouth on the Atlantic and the journeys and explorations of Holub Elton the Mar quis de Campiegne de Brazza Thomson and many others the result of which has been to make known a large part of Africa especially from the equator to Cape Colony and to remove very erroneous impressions that had previously prevailed respecting the interior of the Continentand the Valley of the Congo The water system of the lakes and rivers was found to be more extensive and available than had been supposed and that the great interior or heart of the Continent with the exception of the Kalihara desert at the south was a fruit ful and salubrious country The fact that so large a part of the interior of Africa was of this description that it was inhabited by a very superior race of savages upon whom the slave traders in their terrible raids were constantly encroaching drew in 1876 the attention of His Majesty the King of the Bel gians to this dark continent and to the consideration of what could be done to open it up to civilization His Majesty like the present Emperor of Brazil is an accom plished geographer and being profoundly impressed with the importance of some general movement of this nature he addressed letters to the geographers of the different countries of the world and to distinguished African travellers inviting them as his guests to a conference in his palace in Brussels in September 1876 He did me the honor to invite me by a personal letter to come but my judicial duties at that time much to my regret prevented my accepting the invitation The conclusion reached at this conference was that the best way to bring the interior of Africa into communication with the civilized world was by a systematic and scientific exploration of it especially across the heart of the conti nent from the East to the West Coast so as to facilitate intercourse and prepare the way for trade commerce and the civilization that would follow that to accomplish this it would be necessary to establish a series of stations or settlements from the East to the West Coast below or in the vicinity of the equator and for this purpose what is now 9798 Recent Developments in Central Africa known as the International African Association was formed in 1877 composed of representatives from Belgium Ger many Austria Spain the United States France Italy the Netherlands and Switzerland The work of carrying out its objects was intrusted to an Executive Committee of which His Majesty the King of the Belgians is the head This Executive Committee consisted of three represent ing the Englishspeaking the Germanic and the Latin races It was composed of Sir Bartle Frere Dr Nachtigal the African Explorer M de Quartrefages of the French Institute On the appointment however of Sir Bartle Frere as Governor of the Cape Colonies he resigned and was replaced by the Hon Henry S Sandford of Florida our former Minister to Belgium The first movement was the establishment of a line of stations from the eastern coast opposite Zanzibar to Lake Tanganyka a distance in a direct line of about 450 miles and the founding at the end of these of a permanent settle ment on the lake called Karema the successful accom plishment of which involved a large expenditure of money and the loss of the lives of several members of the expedi tion from the great labor and fatigue undergone How much has been accomplished by this alone will be apparent when I mention that Burton the discoverer of the lake was six months in his journey from the coast to it that it took Cameron afterwards eleven months to make this journey and that it is now made in a month and a half Whilst this was going on on the eastern coast Stanley made his great discovery that the large river the Lualaba of Livingstone was in fact the Upper Congo Stanley having followed it from Nyangwe where Livingstone leftand the Valley of the Congo it and proceeded along and upon it in its northerly course beyond the equator and to the second parallel of north latitude where he fouhd that the river made a great curve to the west and then flowed southwesterly with a varying width of from two to ten miles until it empties into the Atlantic The source of this great river is a large lake discovered by Livingstone Lake Bangweolo on a high plateau which extends to 12 south latitude and near the southern border of which lake this greatest of African explorers afterwards died The whole length of the river is put by Stanley at 2900 miles making it one of the largest rivers in the world and the entire area drained by it he computes to be about 860 000 square miles After this important discovery of the extent of the Congothat it was in fact the great artery of Central Africaanother organization the Congo Committee or Asso ciation Comite dEtude du Haut Congo was formed in Brussels in 1878 to utilize this discovery by establishing regular communication between the upper and lower parts as well as along the whole course of the river and to con nect it as a means of communication across the continent with Karema on Lake Tanganyka and the line of stations from there to the East Coast so as ultimately to establish regular and rapid lines of communication from the mouth of the Congo on the West Coast across the entire width of the Continent to Zanzibar on the East Coast For the past five years the whole of the operations of this Committee have been carried on under the direction of Mr Stanley Both committees though distinct organizations are in effect practically the same as they both aim to accomplish one object in different parts of this great line of communi 99100 Recent Developments in Central Africa cation which they mutually carry on under one general flag which they have adopted as the symbol of the com bined organizations Their design is not to engage in any commercial operations but in those which are purely sci entific geographical and philanthropic so that to use the language of a recent writer Every traveller whatever may be his nationality every missionary whatever may be his faith every legitimate trader whatever may be his com merce may claim assistance at the stations and be cer tain of meeting with hospitality To secure the right to this great pathway for civilization and that protection to life and property which is indispens able in the use of it seventynine treaties have been made with independent chiefs the tribal sovereignties being numerous over so large a space in this part of Africa these treaties covering two thousand miles of the river banks of the Congo and neighboring streams and twentytwo sta tions or settlements have been established the principal ones extending from the lower part of the Congo to the equator a distance of about 700 miles The river is at its mouth six miles in width and 150 fathoms in depth and from there to Vivi the first station or settlement of these Associations the distance is 115 miles upon which the Association have two steamers Seven miles above Vivi the river is obstructed by thirty cataracts or rapids for about forty miles to overcome which a road has been constructed for land travel from Vivi to Insan galia a distance of fiftytwo miles from which the river is navigable again for seventythree miles and upon which the Association has placed a steamer to Manyanga From Manyanga the river is again obstructed for ninetyfive miles along which another road is constructed to theand the Valley of the Congo fourth station or settlement Leopoldville upon Stanley pool 135 miles from Manyanga where the river forms a great basin twentyfive miles long and sixteen miles wide with seventeen islands upon it and from this point Leopoldville named in honor of the King of Belgium there is an uninterrupted navigation through a magnificent and thickly peopled country for the long distance of 940 miles upon which the Association have now placed three steamers having seven altogether on the river The river is again obstructed below the equator for sixtytwo miles at what is known as Stanley falls after which there is uninterruped navigation for the very considerable distance of 220 miles At the end of this the river is obstructed by a fall fifty miles below Nyangwe and by another fifty miles above it Beyond this the river to its source in Lake Bangweolo is but imperfectly known and is supposed not to be navigable I have thought it necessary to be thus particular in describing the river to show that this great water artery of Central Africa is navigable for at least 1400 miles and to explain what has been done to facilitate travel by the con struction of roads along those parts of the river where it is obstructed by cataracts or rapids It is necessary that I should now say a few words re specting the country through which the Congo flows and which is drained by it and its affluents The region usually regarded as Central Africa is that portion of the interior extending from the desert of Sahara in the north to the Kalahara desert in the south and which lies between the 10th and 40th parallels of east longi tude which is computed to embrace an area of about six millions of square miles It is in the eastern portion of 101102 Recent Developments in Central Africa this that the great water system I have referred to of lakes and rivers exists of which the Zambesi emptying into the Indian ocean the Nile into the Mediterranean and the Congo into the Atlantic are the greatest rivers The large portion of Africa extending along the western coast from Sierra Leone to the mouth of the River Ogowe below the equator and from thence across the interior as far as the western shores of the Victoria Nyanza is a vast belt of forest the vegetation here being exceedingly prolific and dense from the tropical heat and great rainfall throughout this region Below this great wooded belt to the Congo and further south there is an open savannah country of large grassy spaces and parklike grouping of trees which is fertile salubrious and densely populated by as I have said a very superior race of savages who are hand somely formed exceedingly vigorous industrious and who exhibit for savages considerable skill in handicraft and in agriculture This is the country mainly through which the Congo and its affluents flow and of which that river is the great artery From the mouth of the river to Boma a distance of eighty miles the land is low marshy and malarious Boma being the hottest place upon the river and unsalubrious as it is surrounded by mangrove swamps But though for this distance the low flat land through which the river runs to the sea is malarious it is not as much so nor as injurious to health as the coast north of it especially at the mouth of the Niger and upon the Gold Coast Along the great length of the western coast from Cape de Verde to the Gaboon and the Congo are hundreds of square miles of brackish and salt water lagoons and swamps which are level with the sea and often onlyand the Valley of the Congo separated from it by a narrow mangrovefringed beach The bottom of these lagoons in the language of Monteiro the recent writer before referred to is generally a soft deep black fetid mud and a stick plunged into it comes up thickly covered with a mass nearly approaching in appear ance to paste blacking In the dry season great expanses of the bottom of these swamps become partially dry and fermenting in the hot tropical sun cause a horrible stench from the decayed millions of small fish crabs etc left exposed on the surface The number of fish and some of the lower forms of life inhabiting the mud and water of these lagoons is almost incredible If one keeps quite still for a few minutes the slimy ground becomes perfectly alive and hissing from the legions of small brightlycol ored land crabs that issue simultaneously from thousands of round holes from the size of a quill to about an inch and a half in diameter It is in these gigantic hotbeds of decomposition that the deadly types of African fever arise and this pest water and mud when swept into the rivers by the floods in the rainy season is carried far and wide with what effect to human life on that coast it is needless to mention   On those parts of the West Coast he remarks where level swampy ground is not the rule a most agreeable change is seen in the character of the landscape although perhaps the climate is just as unhealthy Drenched con stantly by pelting thunderstorms and drizzling mists that roll down from the highlands and mountaintops the country is covered by the most luxuriant forest vege tation in one expanse of the deepest unvarying green the  Monteiro Vol I pp 25 26 103104 Recent Developments in Central Africa combined result of excessive moisture and the tropical sun of an almost uninterrupted summer This alternation of swamp and dense forest ends at the river Congo and a total change then takes place in the country along the coast south of the Congo which is com paratively arid and at about 13 S lat it is little else than an arid rocky and sandy desert From the Congo to Mossameds no forest is seen from the sea and from thence not a single tree for hundreds of miles to the Orange river Nowhere on the coast is there more than an indication of the wonderful vegetation and varied beauty and fertility of the interior Along a large part of the western coast the heavy surf of the Atlantic rolls and beats incessantly wearing away the hardest granite and giving forth a monotonous sound which never ceases In certain parts breaking against high cliffs or rocks in others rolling upon white sandy beaches and as its breaking is unrelieved by the presence of the sea gull or any other bird the continuous moaning sound it gives forth it is said has a depressing effect upon the spirits Sharks exist in great numbers in this surf and are very dangerous but are rarely seen south of the Congo The physical nature and character of the negroes inhabit ing the whole of this western coast is what might be expected from the nature of the country I quote what Monteiro says respecting them in preference to other writers because his work was published only nine years ago and because he has had unusual opportunities for observation having resided many years on the western coast and travelled extensively over it It is impossible he observes to reclaim the hordes of savages inhabiting the interior even of Angola  Monteiro Vol I p 26and the Valley of the Congo from their horrid customs and their disregard for life the insalubrity of the country though it is infinitely superior in this respect to the rest of the West Coast would be an almost insuperable bar to their improvement their own progress is still more hopeless In my opinion it would be necessary that tropical Africa should undergo a total physical revolution that the long line of unhealthy coast should be upheaved and the deadly leagues of pestiferous swamps be thus drained before the country would be fitted for the existence of a higher type of mankind than the present negro race  It can only have been by the countless ages of battling with malaria that they have been reduced physically and morally to their present wonderful state or condition of withstanding successfully the climatic influences so fatal to the white and more highly organized racesthe sun and fevers of their malignant and dismal mangrove swamps or the mists and agues of their magnificent tropical forests no more affecting them than they do the alligators and countless musquitoes that swarm in the former or the monkeys and snakes that inhabit the latter It is really astonishing to see the naked negro without a particle of covering on his head often shaved in the full blaze of the fierce sun his daily food a few handfuls of ground nuts beans or mandioca root and very often most unwholesome water for drink At night he throws himself on the ground anywhere covers himself with a thin grass or cotton cloth nearly transparent in texture without a pillow like a dog and awakes in the morning generally wet through with the heavy dew and does not suffer the least pain or inconven ience from the climate from infancy to old age unless his lungs become affected  Monteiro Vol I pp 69 70 and 71 105106 Recent Developments in Central Africa This writer whose opinion from long acquaintance with the country and its inhabitants is entitled to great weight draws most unfavorable conclusions in respect to the negro from what he has seen and known of him He says  There is no use in disguising the fact that the negro race is men tally different from ours however disagreeable and opposed this may be to prevailing ideas I fearlessly assert that there is hardly such a thing possible as the sincere conver sion of a negro to Christianity whilst he remains in Africa and is under the influence of his fellows and no progress will be made as long as the belief prevails that he is equal to the white man and that he can be reasoned out of his ignorance his prejudices and his belief in feticism The only thing he really believes in is witchcraft He knows neither love affection or jealousy He is inferior in this respect to many animals even to the monkeys and the birds that are about him In all the long years that I have been in Africa I have never seen a negro manifest the least tenderness for or to a negress or the slightest caress that would indicate any loving regard on either side They have no word in their languages for or indicating love or affection He is not cruelthat is he will not inflict pain for the pleasure of doing so but he has no idea of pity mercy or compassion He is neither vindictive nor grateful No amount of bad treatment is resented nor any extent of good done him recognized He is untruthful and dis honest because it is impossible for him to understand that there is anything wrong in being a liar or a thief He has no idea of a Creator or of a future existence He neither adores the sun nor any other object idol or image His whole belief is in evil spirits feticism and witchcraft that can be employed for evil or to counteract it And he sumsand the Valley of the Congo up the negro character in the general statement that it is deficient in the passions and their corresponding virtues that his is organically a rudimentary form of mind that is capable of little development to a higher type This opinion may be justified by the character and condi tion of the negroes dwelling in the malarious belts of the coast of which this writer has had so much experience but it does not follow that it applies equally to the negroes of the interior who dwell in a healthy and fruitful country and who from the report of all who have seen them are a superior race of savages We will now return to the Congo As the river is ascended from Boma it is cooler and healthier and at Vivi and beyond it up the river dysentery which is endemic upon the coast is almost unknown This and much that I have said respecting it is derived from Mr H H Johnson who spent some time upon the Congo last year and who says that the temperature when you reach Stanley Falls is delightful Commander Cameron is most enthusiastic in his description of certain portions of this region which he passed in his journey further south to describe the beauty of which he says would be impos sible as neither poet nor painter could by pen or pencil do full justice to it Monteiro is equally enthusiastic upon the interior of Angola through which he travelled He speaks of creepers of all kinds that attain a gigantic size almost monopolizing the vegetation clasping round the biggest trees covering them with a mass of foliage and flower and forming most exquisite festoons and cur tains as they connect one tree with another in their embrace No words he says can describe the luxuriance of these tree creepers particularly in the vicinity of the 107Recent Developments in Central Africa shallow rivers and rivulets of the interior Several trees together he found covered from top to bottom with a rich mantle of the India rubber creeper with bright large dark green leaves somewhat resembling those of the magnolia thickly studded with large bunches of purest white jas minelike flowers loading the air for a considerable dis tance with its powerful bitteralmond perfume and attract ing a cloud of buzzing insects Once at Bembe he says I saw a perfect wall or curtain formed by a most delicate per hung from top to bottom with bottlebrushlike flowers about three inches long but the grandest view presented to my eyes was in the Pungo Adongo range where the bottom of a narrow valley for quite half a mile in length was filled as they all are in the interior by a dense forest of high trees The creepers in search of light had pierced through and spread on the top where their stems and leaves had become woven and matted into a thick carpet on which their flowers were produced in such profusion that hardly a leaf was visible but only one long sea of beautiful purple like a glacier of color filling the valley and set in a frame of green of the luxuriant grass covered hillsides The very blacks that accompanied me so little impressed as they are usually by the beauties of nature beat their open mouths with the palm of their hand as they uttered short  Ah  ah ahs their universal mode of expressing astonish ment or delight so wonderful even to them appeared the magnificent mass of color below us as it suddenly came in view when we arrived at the head of the valley down one side of which we descended to the plain below Stanley estimates the population of this fertile and salu brious region as high as 49000000 and Keith Johnson  Monteiro Vol 1 pp 31 to 32 108and the Valley of the Congo the geographer says in taking a general survey of it from Lake Tanganyka to the western coast it is evident it is a country of enormous natural wealth The oil palm flourishes throughout the broad valley of the Upper Congo and cotton coffee tobacco pepper nutmeg and India rubber are among the vegetable productions that grow wild Indian corn wheat rice sweet potatoes and other vegetable products which have been introduced by the Portuguese grow everywhere and as respects the metals iron and copper exist in abundance iron in fact being very skilfully worked by the natives The ivory trade is a very important one The ivory comes from the interior and is brought to the coast by caravans It is procured from animals that are killed to obtain it and is not ivory found among the remains of elephants that have died a nat ural death The natives laugh at the idea of ivory becom ing scarce so that the number slaughtered must be small in comparison with the living herds which the natives are in the habit of seeing in the vast plains of the interior The western coast abounds with fish some of which like the pungo that visits the coast in the cold seasonthat is from June to Augustweigh nearly 100 pounds The Bay of Musserra is a noted place for the capture of this fine fish as many as 40 or 50 being caught there in a day with a hook and line The fish is an article of trade but very few of the natives engage in the business of fishing they make so much by trading that they will not take the trouble There is a remarkable deposit of malachite in Angola south of the Congo It is often found in large solid blocks one resting on two smaller ones and weighing together over three tons but it occurs mostly in flat veins without 109110 Recent Developments in Central Africa any definite dip or order sometimes two feet in thickness and much fissured The mines were for some time aban doned but are now I believe worked by the natives The plant that produces the India rubber is the giant tree creeper before referred to as covering the highest trees The stem is sometimes as thick as a mans thigh and forests are festooned by it to a large extent and in all directions the thick stems tying the trees together like great hawsers  Every part of this creeper exudes a milky juice when cut or wounded but unlike the India rubber of America this milky sap will not run in a vessel placed to receive it for it dries so quickly that it forms a ridge on the wound or cut that stops its further flow The blacks collect it therefore by making long cuts in the bark with a knife and as the milky juice gushes out it is wiped off continually with their fingers and smeared on their arms shoulders and breast until a thick covering is formed when this is peeled off their bodies and cut into small squares Gum copal is found here of the finest quality but not enough is obtained to meet the demand for it as the natives are not disposed to dig for it Very little of the coffee produced is cultivated most of it being the product of coffeetrees growing spontaneously Coffee is found growing wild in the virgin forests of the interior but it is believed not to be native to the country but to have been originally introduced by the old Portu guese missionaries and to have been spread into the interior by the agency of monkeys and birds There are mTlnortant coffee plantations carried on by slave labor but they exist under great disadvantages for the want of  Monteiro Vol 1 p 138and the Valley of the Congo roads Generally the natives do not take to the plant ing of coffee as they find it growing wild It grows only in certain parts of the interior but the production of it in the future is unlimited from the great extent of country suitable for its cultivation The chief port for its exportation is Ambriz where a considerable trade is now carried on in this article Cotton is grown sparingly everywhere It is picked from the seeds and beaten on the ground with a switch to open it out It is then spun by hand and the cotton thread is woven by the natives into strong thick cloth But this industry has fallen off from the importation of foreign cot ton goods Food is abundant everywhere and exceedingly cheap growing with the greatest luxuriance in the fertile regions of the interior Cattle are easily reared except in the regions farther south where they are exposed to the tetse fly Sheep goats and poultry also thrive But the indolence of the natives prevents them from availing themselves to any great extent of the capabilities of the soil and climate for the rearing of these animals Among the available vegetable productions is the baobab tree one of the giants of the vegetable kingdom which grows to the height of 40 feet and has a huge trunk the diameter of which is from 20 to 30 feet The fibre of this tree is used to make paper cordage c Millions of these trees cover the whole of Angola south of the Congo Another great product of the country is groundnuts or as we call them peanuts which are exported to Europe to make a certain kind of oil In Africa they constitute a large article of food among the natives 111112 Recent Developments in Central Africa In the grass region the grass grows to a great height and journeys have to be made in the wet season through it the traveller lying in a hammock which is slung to a pole and carried by negro bearers It is not an agreeable mode of travelling As he lies in the hammock he is below the grass where he sees nothing but a small part of the sky above him and where it is intensely hot in addition to which he has to stand what animals will sometimes turn away fromthe disagreeable odor emanating from the bodies of his hardlyworked negro bearers The curse of this favored land is the internal slave trade of the East Coast of which the Portuguese are still the principal abettors but whose efforts have been greatly arrested by the power and influence already acquired by the African International Association and the Congo Com mittee the efforts of these combined organizations being largely directed to the suppression of this dreadful traffic which wherever it is successfully carried on leaves behind it a wilderness What has already been accomplished by those two philanthropic organizations in this opening up of Cen tral Africa has involved the expenditure of an enor mous amount of money the principal part of which it is known the King of the Belgians has supplied from his own private purse In fact no such example of enlightened munificence in forwarding geographical explor ation has been seen as he has exhibited since the days of Prince Henry of Portugal surnamed the Navigator who by his comprehensive insight and large expenditure of means inaugurated in the fifteenth century that great movement for maritime exploration which led to the pas sage of the Cape of Good Hope and the discovery ofand the Valley of the Congo America But although much has been done during the last six years much is still to be done Twothirds of the way says a recent writer remain to be marked out In traversing it there are immense regions to be explored and millions of human beings to be brought within the reach of civilization After these six years of laborious efforts on the part of these bodies acting practically as one organization and what they have achievedtheir large expenditure of money the territorial rights and privileges they have acquired by treaties with the barbaric sovereignties who are in actual occupation the steamers they have placed upon the rivers the stations they have established and the protection they have afforded to life and property exer cising in fact under a general flag the incipient powers of governmentthe small European monarchy of Portugal with little more than four millions of inhabitants suddenly starts up and claims the right to control the mouth of this great water artery of Africa upon the claim of having dis covered it four centuries ago which discovery if it con ferred at the time any rights to the river or to the land upon either bank of it have long since been lost by non user and what that control means the commercial gentle men present will understand when I state that in the Por tuguese possessions on the western coast below the Congo the capital and seaport of which is St Paul de Loando all merchandise brought into Africa there is subject to a duty of 40 per cent with a rebate of 30 per cent if the owners of the merchandise are Portuguese a regulation which practically excludes all other nations except the Portu guese from trading with the interior of Africa along that part of the western coast 113114 Recent Developments in Central Africa To claim a territory by the right of discovery which has not been followed up by actual and continued occupation is as to its effect upon other nations of no more value in the present age than paper blockades The maritime and commercial interests of the world at the present day will tolerate no such assumption The claim of Portugal to the mouth of the Congo and the territory adjoining both banks of the river below Yallala Falls amounts as I un derstand it to this that just four centuries ago this pres ent year or in 1483 one Diego Cam a knight of the house hold of the King of Portugal discovered the mouth of the river and formally took possession of it by erecting a stone pillar on the south part now known as Point Padron that he sailed up the river a short distance which was then called by the natives the Zaire but afterwards received the name of the Congo as it was on the border and the boun dary of the kingdom of Congo This with some trading factories which the Portuguese had with other nations during the active years of the slave trade and which they have no longer is about all that they have done for centuries to possess themselves of the river or of the countries through which it flows They did settle in the capital of the King of Congo at the south which they named San Salvador but practically abandoned it afterwards for San Paul de Loando upon the coast further south They retained formal possession of San Salvador but even this they had entirely abandoned before Stanleys great discovery The fact is the northern limit of the territory of which they nlow have possession is a few miles north of Ambris the outlet for the coffee trade of the interior the northern boundary of the Portuguese dominion being a small riverand the Valley of the Congo a little above Ambris called the Loge Over the country north of this or its people they have no control whatever any influence they may formerly have had has passed away the people being now independent of them and opposed to allowing any of the white races to penetrate their country from the coast to the interior Beyond the river and the coast is a European settlement Kinsambo which is cosmo politan and independent Point Banana the settlement on the north side of the mouth of the Congo consists of factories of Dutch French and English Boma is the trading port of the river con taining factories or agencies of many nationalities chiefly Dutch and English and is rapidly increasing in trade and population It was formerly a great slave station to which slaveships of different nations resorted being maintained then by the raids of the slavetraders into the interior who depopulated the country far inward In good seasons thirty thousand tons of African produce are exported by the trading houses on the Congo and two millions and a half pounds sterling of English manufactured goods are imported there Lord Mayo who in 1882 investigated the subject says that Portugal has not imported to or exported from the Congo a single ton She has he says no trade of any kind in all the neutral territory from Kin sembo down to Kabenda nor at the Congo Upon what is here stated the discovery of the mouth of the river their formally taking possession of it by the erec tion of the pillar aforesaid and that they have never given up what they thus took possession of symbolically is as I understand it about the extent of their claim They seem to think that the putting up of their stone bauble four hundred years ago at the mouth of this great artery 115116 Recent Developments in Central Africa although they have done nothing since to develop it as a pathway to the interior entitles them now to control those who have which is so preposterous and absurd in respect to the immense region to which the Congo is the natural waterway that the mere statement of its absurdity is suf ficient Whatever other nationalities may do we certainly will not as a great commercial nation assent to any such claim We are called upon now to enter our protest and to enforce it if necessary against any such pretension not only as a commercial nation but as the home of a popula tion descended from the natives of Africa who are greater in point of numbers than the entire population of Portugal The whole population of Portugal is but a fraction over four millions and the colored population of the United States is over six millions and a half We have also an interest in the Republic of Liberia extending 600 miles along the western coast founded by the American Coloni zation Society of this country out of a population com posed of free Africans and of recaptured and emancipated slaves which has maintained itself under great difficulties for sixty years and is now an independent government possessing not only this extensive line of coast but a val utable country in the interior to which from its salubrity African emigration from the United States has been largely attracted within the past few years and Sieeria has now after a long struggle the appearance of becoming a perma nent civilized African State It has been suggested by European writers that an Inter national Protectorate should be established at the mouth of the Congo but I see no occasion to resort to this entangling diplomatic contrivance It is much better to leave those who settle on the Congo to apply to theirand the Valley of the Congo condition the principle of selfgovernment as was done in the settlement of this country and of which our history furnishes so many satisfactory illustrations and as was done by the Boers in the Orange Free State and in the Transvaal before the English followed them and claimed the right to rule over them against their will The settlers on the Congo and in the countries adjacent will manage their own affairs infinitely better than officials acting as the representatives of a combina tion of foreign governments In fact this is now taking place over the whole field of the operations of the International African Association and its coadjutor the Congo Committee and the true course is to allow this organization to go on with its practical work and for for eign nations like ourselves to recognize it as an organiza tion in actual occupation of the country administering its affairs in the general interests of civilization and to the satisfaction of the native races within its influence for whose benefit it was instituted Portugals idea of the colonization of Africa is the very opposite of this It is to colonize it not for the benefit of Africa but for the benefit of Portugal This she may do on that part of the south west coast of which she is and has long since been in actual possession but when she undertakes to assume control of the mouth of the great artery of Central Africa other com mercial nations will say that she shall not or at least we will and if need be exercise the power of a large nation to enforce it The proper course now to pursue to prevent future diffi culty is to recognize the two international African Asso ciations as in possession of the country over which their operations extend and de facto exercising the power of 117118 Recent Developments in Central Africa government undler a common flag To do so is not without precedent In 1878 the Sultans of Brunei and of Sala in Borneo ceded to Baron Overbeck an Austrian and to Mr Dent an Englishman all their rights over a considerable territory in the northern part of the island These gentle men having made over their title to an English company this company obtained in 1881 a charter of incorporation from the English Government The grant of this charter gave rise in the House of Commons to a discussion in which the ground taken by the Ministry was that they found themselves confronted by accomplished facts that the company was legally in possession of a part of a for eign territory and that they had confined themselves to conceding the advantages of a purely commercial recogni tion in exchange for a certain control which the Crown was to exercise in the interests of the natives and of gen eral peace The policy of recognizing the organization now in posses sion of the Upper Congo becomes more important in the light of recent events A year or more ago the En glish Cabinet entered into negotiations for a treaty with Portugal by which her right to the territories beyond her present possessions on the West Coast to and including the mouth of the Congo should be recognized which was not carried out owing to the opposition of Parliament On the 26th of last February however a formal treaty was signed between Great Britain and Portugal by which the sovereignty of Portugal is recognized between 5 12 and 8 South latitude that is on the West Coast from about the bay of Kabenda north of the Congo to the Por tuguese possessions south of it and then up the river to a little below Vivi at Nokki which the treaty recognizes as inand the Valley of the Congo the possession of the African International Association This treaty is not the result of any change of convictions as previously expressed respecting the right of Portugal of which England has long been the consistent opponent but as I understand is made in return for certain con cessions by Portugal to England on the East Coast and in South Africa This may be very well for England and Portugal but there are other nations in the world who will have something to say in the matter The free navigation of the Congo it is said is assured by the treaty but as I understand nothing is said in it re specting the transit by land on both sides of the river a distance of over 100 miles a very important part of this great highway to Central Africa for all upriver goods have to be transshipped and go by Bomba This part of the transit or highway therefore would be under the sole control of the Portuguese a people who in Africa like the Bourbons have learned nothing and forgotten nothing It is difficult to speak with moderation of this attempt on the part of Portugal abetted by the present English Ministry thus to obtain control of everything on both sides of the river for more than one hundred miles from its mouth now that there is a prospect of its becoming through the efforts of others an important mart of trade The Mozambique tariff will I assume be extended over it subjecting all who trade there not only to the duties imposed but what is worse to the ruinous delays and exactions of the wretchedly paid officials that Portugal has in her African colonies What assurance the world will have from Portugals having sovereign dominion there can readily be inferred from their management of their present colonies on the West Coast the management of 119120 Recent Developments in Central Africa which elicited from a writer so well informed as Monteiro the remark that  It is a great pity that Portugal should neglect so disgracefully her colonies so rich in themselves and offering such wonderful advantages in every way for colonization and development And he gives this instance of what he calls their usual blind and absurd policy Ambriz was up to the year 1855 in the hands of the natives and was one of their principal ports on the western coast Here were established American and Liverpool houses trading in gum copal malachite and ivory and disposing in exchange of cotton and other goods In that year the Portuguese took possession of Ambriz and at once levied heavy duties on all goods imported The consequence was that the foreign houses to escape their exactions removed to another place on the other side of the small river that marks the Portuguese boundary the effect of which was he says that the trade of Ambriz was completely annihilated and for many years the revenue barely sufficed to pay the salaries of the revenue officers But I have dwelt sufficiently long on this subject and will in conclusion say in respect to the future of Africa that there is upon the western coast little reason to sup pose that it will ever be very different from what it is now that while the same physical conditions continue the same results will follow the forces of nature there being too strong for the influence of man to counteract them In respect however to the interior of this great conti nent there is reason to believe that a great deal can and will be achieved there in the future That it will be by an influx of white races which by their superior industry energy and high civilization will gradually exterminate the blacks as the white races extinguished the Indianand the Valley of the Congo aborigines of our own continent is not generally believed It is supposed by the bestinformed that the natives of the interior being different from those of the coast will greatly improve under the influences of the whites who may settle in that healthy region and that it is possible that a civilization may grow up there that will in respect to race be extensively African It certainly will not if the whole negro race should prove to be what Mr Monteiro thinks it is There are those who are doubtful whether the resources of Africa are worth all the trouble which has been taken to open up the country They claim that ivory India rtbber and gum are the only products that are of any yalue and that ivory is getting every year scarcer that a large part of the country is unavailable from the excess of moisture and other parts equally so from the want of it and finally that the white man can never colonize tropical Africa whether upon the coast or in the interior These anticipa tions read very much like the predictions which were once indulged in respecting Georgia and other of our Southern States They are not however the impressions of those who have explored the interior Stanley Cameron H H Johnson and others who are better able to judge than those who know the country only by report Johnson found the soil in the valleys especially along the Congo of the richest kind and speaks of the time when these valleys will be waving with golden grain He declares that the climate of the interior tableland is wholly different from that of the miasmatic coast and that with ordinary precautions a white man there need not have a days illness that ordinary temperance in 121122 Recent Developments in Central Africa eating and drinking and one or two other simple pre cautions will keep a sound man healthy The indications certainly are that there is a future in Central Africa There is a civilization now spreading there which is moving northerly up from South Africa and which will ultimately become connected with and enlarged by the communication now being established across the continent along the valley of the Congo and we may I think feel the assurance that this movement will continue until the whole interior of this vast continent so yields itself up to the dominion of civilized manand the Valley of the Congo APPENDIX THE CONGO TREATY HOW THE YIELDING TO PORTUGUESE CLAIMS WILL INJURE COMMERCE London Pall Mall Gazette March 1884 The London Pall Mall Gazette publishes an article on British Trade Under the Congo Treaty being the sub stance of an interview with an old Congo trader A Port uguese is poison wherever you find him at any rate out of Portugal Such was the comprehensive summing up of an old British trader who has had many years experience on both sides of the African continent He was a tall spare grizzled Englishman without an ounce of superfluous flesh on his body but showing a little trace of the succes sion of fevers and agues which he had suffered in the mala rial swamps on the African coast The Portuguese is poison he said poison to British trade and especially to the British trader The English merchant avoids terri tory over which the Portuguese flag flies as the devil hates holy water It is not only their tariff but the custom houses and the endless delays which they interpose in the transaction of any kind of business Theyre a bad lot a very bad lot Their only conception of government in the greater part of their possessions is to plant a custom house at every little port or creek where goods can be landed in order to collect import duties and compel the unfortunate traders to grease the wheels of routine with palm oil Be yond gunshot of these stations they exercise no authority over the natives they profess to govern You may call that government if you please I call it levying blackmail and 123Recent Developments in Central Africa so does every English trader who has ever done business in Portuguese Africa TRADING WITH TIIE NATIVES It is some time since I left the Congo but when I was there I was at the head of one of the largest businesses in that region I was only a young man when I went out but the pay was high and the occupation adventurous and I kept at it for several years until the climate killed those I loved and worked for when I got tired of the place and came away and since I left I believe the business has un dergone a complete revolution owing to the regular calling of steamers at Banana Creek In the old days trade was centralized in the hands of three British firms as it required large capital and extensive stock Since the steamers began to ply regularly the necessity for keeping such large stock has disappeared smaller men have gone into the trade and there is much more competition than there was But in its essential elements business on the Congo is as it was when I left the coast It was rather exciting to carry on busi ness on the Congo what with pirates and Portuguese and the malaria traders had pretty lively times I had numer ous stations scattered along the coast from Ambrizette in the south to PontaBanda north At each of these we had depots of goods which I visited regularly in turn collect ing the produce of the country and giving in exchange all descriptions of British goods Rum gunpowder and guns formed about onethird of the total business transacted we traded up the rivers as far as they were navigable I would send for instance 100 worth of goods in a lighter with a native agent who would barter them for palm oil Up the Congo I went myself with my steamer hauling 124and the Valley of the Congo lighters up the stream against the current which runs very strong between the innumerable islands which crowd the Lower Congo UNDER FIRE I had a small army of kroomen whom I recruited in the north at Monrovia and Cape Palmas good sturdy workers who were paid a good wage and were very faith ful Of course they stole like cats but they would not allow anybody else to steal but themselves and were ready to defend me to the death That was no empty phrase for I have had them shot dead by my side The Lower Congo is the resort of native pirates called the Missalongas who prey upon all the traffic native and foreign that frequents their river One of the most awkward things about the navigation of the lower Congo is that the channel is con tinually changing new banks are formed during the rainy season and nothing is more common than to be stuck on your return journey in a place where deep water was flow ing when you went up stream It is a very disagreeable experience to be stranded all night in the lee of one of the numerous islands from which the Missalongas under cover of the mangroves are pelting you with slugs Of course you fire back every lighter carries its stack of rifles ready for instant use Admiral Hewett whom I knew very well and admired immensely when he was on the Congo taught them a very severe lesson but it is diffi cult to punish them effectively You can only burn down their houses when you can get to them after toiling through the mangrove swamps and then a few hours labor Suffices to build them up again as good as new 125126 Recent Developments in Central Africa THE PORTUGUESE TREATY And now by this new treaty you have handed over both banks of the Lower Congo to the Portuguese When I heard of it at first it seemed to me sheer lunacy and my opinion is that of every man who has ever done business in a Portuguese colony At Lisbon they may be very friendly and respect the English mightily but get them away in Africa and youll find that every Portuguese official regards it as the first duty of man to harass the British trader in all manner or ways Naturally I dont like this Congo treaty To begin with it means doubling the duties on every article imported from Great Britain At present we pay five per cent as near as may be to the native chiefs Henceforth we have to pay six per cent to the Portuguese That will I take it be in addition to the five cent already paid to the chiefs Of course if the Portuguese will undertake to satisfy the chiefs out of their six per cent well and good But trust a Portuguese not to part with any of his six per cent and as you may be equally sure that the native chiefs who have hitherto been paid five per cent will not give up a cent of their tax with out a struggle there will be nothing for it but to pay eleven per cent or fight and get into no end of trouble FUTURE TRADE ROUTES I should have preferred it to be neutral ground policed by an international commission But after all it is not so great a matter Of course it increases the difficulties of traders all over the territory ceded to Portugal That goes without saying The Portuguese is the natural enemy of our trade and to let the Portuguese in is usually to drive British trade out But if you can really secure freeand the Valley of the Congo transit without the worries and delays of Portuguese cus toms officials through the Lower Congo to Vivi it does not much matter The true route to the Upper Congo is not through the dangerous archipelago of islands and mud banks terminating in a cul de sac at the Yellala Falls Trade will reach the Upper Congo but by the Kwilu or Quillo which lies to the north of 5 deg 12 min That is the trade route of the future and on that as yet no Portuguese has laid a finger II OPINIONS ON THE TREATY Opinions expressed at the meeting of the Royal Geo graphical Society February 11th 1884 affecting the treaty with Portugal by persons who have visited the Congo during the previous year H H JOHNSTON said if ever a railway was made to Stanley pool it would be along the valley of the Kuilu in which case Landana would be its outlet When Mr Stanley was there he was very anxious that it should not get into the hands of either the French or Portuguese The Dutch merchants at Ban ana had informed him that there was an arrangement on foot by which the Portuguese Government would occupy both sides of the Congo mouth In that case everything else would be in the hands of Portugal He read in the daily papers that the Portuguese were prepared to allow the same liberal terms as were at present in vogue in Mozam bique but those who knew anything of Mozambique 127Recent Developments in Central Africa would think that the terms were rather illiberal than otherwise He therefore thought it would be a very unfor tunate thing if Portugal was allowed to occupy Landana and Banana the two points which would affect the Congo in the future SIR FOWELL BUXTON said although he had nothing to contribute to our geo graphical knowledge of the Congo he wished to put one or two questions to the gentlemen who had so recently returned from the river It would be interesting to know what if any traces were still to be found of that Portu guese dominion which was of great importance several centuries ago Formerly that dominion was a real thing and it was administered to a great degree on the best Chris tian principles of that time The old Portuguese governors wished that their government should be for the benefit of the governed and they exercised their control with a great deal of masterfulness guided by Christianity It could not be doubted that their government extended over a very large area and lasted for a long time If all trace of their dominion had vanished it would be a fact worth knowing He also wished to know if the readers of the papers were able to measure the effect of Stanley s and De Brazzas work whether trade had sensibly increased and if so whether that increase had led to greater communication between the different tribes and therefore to more friendly inter course and to the diminution of intertribal wars He believed that such had been the effect where communica tions had been opened out in other parts of Africa and it might reasonably be hoped that the same result would be experienced in the valley of the Congo 128and the Valley of the Congo GENERAL SIR F GOLDSMID in replying to the questions that had been put by Sir Fowell Buxton said that from the little he had seen of the Congo he was only able to answer imperfectly but he thought there was now scarcely any trace whatever of Portuguese dominion in those parts At the present day he did not suppose that the Portuguese were better known along the river banks than the English Dutch French or other nations there represented At Loanda of course Portuguese influence prevailed as also further down the coast for some distance but it was generally understood that a white man could not go from Loanda to Ambriz without being molested by the natives A statement to this effect will be found in Mr Monteiros clever book on Angola published about nine years ago and he Sir Frederic had learnt on trustworthy local authority cor roborated to the best of his recollection by a Portuguese gentleman on board the steamer in which he travelled that such was still the case With regard to the trade on the Congo he did not think that as yet there had been any palpable increase in the imports and exports but this result could hardly be expected so soon He had little doubt that when more stations had been formed and the aims and objects of the association were more clearly understood the whole would in time become centres as it were of traffic and a great impetus would be given to commerce and the march of civilization TIIE PRESIDENT LORD ABERDARE said he would not be tempted by the political hints that had been thrown out to enter into the question whether or not Mr Gladstone was going to violate his promise that 129130 Recent Developments in Central Africa the treaty with Portugal should be submitted to the House of Commons nor whether the Dutch merchants had received information as to the contents of the treaty which were not known in this country He had no doubt that in pro cess of time it would be found that Her Majestys Govern ment would do all that they had promised to do and sub mit their treaty to the consideration of Parliament and he was bound to say that if they had shown too great con sideration for the interests of Portugal it could not be for want of ample notice in Parliament and out of the opinion of the mercantile community in this country With those considerations however the Geographical Society had nothing to do Their interests were geographical and the progress of geography led to commerce which when con ducted as it was in these days generally led to the advan tage and improvement of a country It may not have been so in the past when the most active commerce in those districts was in human beings but things were altered now and with little exception commerce was now the handmaid of progress III THE CONGO From the New York Herald April 24 1884 RECOGNITION OF THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT WASHINGTON April 22 1884The injunction of secresy was removed today from the resolution adopted by the Senate in executive session April 10 authorizing theand the Valley of the Congo recognition of the African International Association which is now opening up to commerce the valley of the Congo The resolution is as follows IN EXECUTIVE SESSION  SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES April 10 1884 Resolved That the Senate concurs in the views expressed by the President of the United States in his last annual message to Congress in reference to the interests of the United States in the settlement of the Congo country in Africa and in the opening of that country to the free access of the people and lawful commerce of all other countries And that it is the opinion of the Senate that the flag of the African International Association should be recognized as the flag of a friendly government ANSON G MCooK Attest By CHARLES W JOHNSON Chief Clerk THE PRESIDENTS VIEWS The views expressed by the President in his last annual message were as follows The rich and populous valley of the Congo is being opened to commerce by a society called the International African Association of which the King of the Belgians is the president and a citizen of the United States the chief execu tive officer Large tracts of territory have been ceded to the Association by native chiefs Roads have been opened steamboats placed on the river and the nuclei of States established at twentytwo stations under one flag which offers freedom to commerce and prohibits the slave trade The objects of the Society are philanthropic It does not aim at permanent political control but seeks the neutrality of the valley The United States cannot be indifferent to this work nor to the interests of their citizens involved in it It may become advisable for us to cooperate with other commercial powers in promoting the rights of trade and residence in the Congo valley free from the interference or political control of any one nation To PREVENT THE SLAVE TRADE In view of the action of the Senate in this matter as above shown Mr Henry S Sanford the representative of the African International Association today executed and delivered to the Secretary of State the following official declaration Declaration by the International Association of the Congo The International Association of the Congo hereby declares that by treaties with the legitimate sovereigns in the basin of the Congo and of the Niadi 131132 Recent Developments in Central Africa Kialun and in adjacent territories upon the Atlantic there has been ceded to it territory for the use and benefit of free States established and being established under the care and supervision of the said Association in the said basins and adjacent nations and to do all in their power to prevent the slave trade In testimony whereof Henry S Sanford duly empowered therefor by the said Association acting for itself and for the said free States has hereunto set his hand and affixed his seal this 22d day of April 1884 in the City of Wash ington H S SANFORD THE FLAG RECOGNIZED Upon receipt of this declaration Secretary Frelinghuysen by direction of the President made the following official anpouncement of the recognition of the flag of the Inter national African Association as the flag of a friendly gov ernment  Frederick T Frelinghuysen Secretary of State duly empowered therefor by the President of the United States of America and pursuant to the advice and consent of the Senate heretofore given acknowledges the receipt of the foregoing notification from the International Associa tion of the Congo and declares that in harmony with the traditional policy of the United States which enjoins a proper regard for the commercial interests of their citizens while at the same time avoiding interference with contro versies between other powers as well as alliances with foreign nations the Government of the United States announces its sympathy with and approval of the humane and benevolent purpose of the International Association of the Congo administering as it does the interests of the free States there established and will order the officers of the United States both on land and sea to recognize the flag of the International African Association as the flag of a friendly governmentand the Valley of the Congo In testimony whereof he has hereunto set his hand and affixed his seal this 22d day of April AD 1884 in the City of Washington Signed FREDERICK T FRELINGHUYSEN IV From the London Times April 18 1884 THE CONGO TREATY a We have already expressed our conviction that the treaty lately concluded between this country and Portugal on the subject of the River Congo is well calculated in the main to promote the interests of both countries To that judg ment we adhere but it is impossible to ignore the fact that the treaty is regarded with considerable dislike in many quarters both in England and abroad and that its ratifica tion is likely to encounter an active opposition in the House of Commons The dislike and opposition are based on vari ous grounds Impatience of control in a district where trade and commerce have hitherto been entirely free is one of these grounds and distrust of the good intentions and perhaps in some cases even of the good faith of Portugal is another These and the like objections would as we have admitted be valid enough if in default of a treaty matters on the Congo were likely for any length of time to remain in statu quo That however is a very improbable contingency The attention of the commercial world is be coming concentrated on the Congo and the importance of its upper waters in the development of the trade of Central Africa is almost daily becoming more manifest We print 133134 Recent Developments in Central Africa elsewhere by a wellinformed correspondents account of Mr Stanleys latest operations from which it will be seen that the peaceful settlements of the International African Association are being pushed further and further into the interior and it is certain that the growth of com mercial intercourse and the extension of missionary enter prise and of other influences of civilization must sooner or later render necessary the control of the mouth of the great waterway by some organization of European origin and authority The Congo Treaty is an attempt to provide this organization It is not by any means an ideally perfect arrangement but it is probably the best that could be made in the circumstances The alternatives to it are all for var ious reasons either impracticable or inexpedient It would hardly be thought convenient or desirable even by those who object to the treaty for England to occupy the terri tory herself and its exclusive occupation by any other firstrate European Power is manifestly not to be thought of There remain the alternatives of an International Commission similar to that which controls the navigation of the Danube and of a concession to Portugal under suit able conditions and restrictions of the sovereignty which she has long claimed but has never practically exercised The first alternative was proposed by Lord Granville in the course of the negotiations but was decisively vetoed by the Portuguese Government It only remained there fore to accept the second though in doing so Lord Gran ville was careful as it seems to us to concede nothing that could operate to the disadvantage of traders or was likely to restrict the established freedom of international inter courseand the Valley of the Congo We are aware that this opinion is not shared by the many critics of the treaty But their objections are based for the most part not upon what the treaty contains nor yet upon what it omits but on the way in which it is thought likely to work Portugal in fact is not trusted to carry out her part of the engagement We cannot pretend to attach much weight to objections of this chatacter The sovereignty of Portugal so far as it is admitted is conceded not in deference to the shadowy historical claims which Lord Granville distinctly declined to recognize but in consideration of advantages secured to England and other nations by the treaty If Portugal should fail to carry out the treaty in spirit as well as in letter if she were to attempt to impose dues not sanctioned by the Treaty or to withhold any of the advantages guaranteed by it England on her part would be disengaged from the obligations to observe it the treaty would fall to the ground and with it would disappear the rights of sovereignty conceded by it to Portugal Under the treaty therefore we get all we practically want and we should still get as much by some other method if the treaty were violated by Portugal For this reason we are not inclined to attach much weight to objections raised to the treaty on the score of distrust of Portugal But a far more formidable objection is taken by Mr Forster in the important letter which we print this morning Mr Forster points out that Lord Granville himself admitted in the course of the negotiations that there could be no advantage in concluding a treaty which would not be accepted by other Powers whose acceptance would be indispensable before it could come into operation In view of this admission it obviously be comes of great importance to ascertain how far the treaty 135136 Recent Developments in Central Africa is likely to be accepted by those other Powers whose acceptance is indispensable to its successful operation M D Antas it is true asserted in his reply to Lord Gran ville that the Portuguese Government had not the slight est fear that the sovereignty of Portugal the treaty once made with Great Britain would not be recognized by other nations but Mr Forster certainly shows some reason to doubt whether this conviction is likely to be sus tained Indeed Lord Granville himself so long ago as last June expressed a doubt to the same effect He pointed out that France was by no means inclined unconditionally to recognize the pretensions of Portugal though he ex pressed a hope that the assent of all civilized Powers would be accorded to the provisions of such a convention as that under consideration Even that hope has not as yet by any means been fulfilled Mr Forster calls attention pertinently enough to a telegram printed by us last week in which it was stated that the Senate of the United States had passed a resolution recognizing the International African Association on the Congo and intended as a pro test against the AngloPortuguese treaty Thus the acceptance of the treaty by the United States is certainly more than doubtful and Mr Forster further adduces reasons for thinking that neither France nor Holland is much more favorably disposed towards it It is obvious that if such should really be the case the treaty is at once deprived of its strongest recommendation and of the greater part of its practical value Lord Gran ville himself has pointed out the futility of a mere dual arrangement between the two countries unrecognized by other Powers and if the treaty is thus reduced to a caput mortuum by the refusal of other Powers to recognize it theand the Valley of the Congo question of its intrinsic merits or demerits at once becomes one of very slight importance At any rate there is no little reason in Mr Forsters demand that the views of the other Powers interested should be officially ascertained before the treaty is ratified If the other Powers in spite of present appearances to the contrary should be found willing to recognize the treaty and accept its conditions the fact will materially strengthen the case in favor of the treaty in this country If on the other hand they should formally decline to recognize it it will on Lord Granvilles own showing hardly be worth while for this country to proceed with it On the whole we are inclined to think that Mr Forster may have somewhat overrated the objec tions entertained to the treaty in other countries It secures for them as it does for ourselves all the substantial advan tages they enjoy at present and it settles on a permanent and equitable basis some very awkward questions which might in default of some specific arrangement at any moment be raised So long as the treaty is loyally carried out by Portugal it harms no one and confers equal advan tages on all If it should not be loyally carried out it would cease by that very circumstance to have any binding force and matters would remain in statu quo until some alternative settlement could be devised We fail to under stand why considerations of this kind should not weigh as strongly with other Powers as in our judgment they are entitled to weigh in England Mr Forster however is evidently no friend to the treaty and therefore he is per haps somewhat inclined to overestimate the force of the objections entertained to it abroad He would prefer that our Government should follow the course taken by the Senate of the United States and recognize the International 137138 Recent Developments in Central Africa African Association This however is a question which goes a good deal beyond that directly raised by the treaty now under consideration and the Portuguese Government which refused to entertain the proposal of an International Commission is not very likely to be willing to waive its claims in favor of the International Association It may however be conceded to Mr Forster that the attitude assumed towards the treaty by other Powers interested is a very material element in the estimate of its value and importance to this country As an international instru ment acceptable to and recognized by all civilized Powers it is a settlement to which it is not easy to take serious objection But if it is to be reduced to a mere dual agree ment unrecognized by other Powers it is hardly worth while to consider whether it should be ratified or not b STANLEYS OPERATIONS The significance of the latest news as to Mr Stanleys doings and intentions may not be apparent to the ordinary reader without some explanation He has we are told suc ceeded in planting a station at Stanley falls To those who have read the stirring narrative of his journey down the great river in 1877 this must appear a wonderful feat At the time of the recent visit of Mr Johnston to the Congo B6olob some 80 miles to the north of Stanley pool and 2 O south of the equator seems to have been the most remote station but beyond that there are now at least three stations One of these Lukalela is about 60 miles to the north and another Equator station is just where the river leaves the equator in its course southwards The third one is that of the foundation of which we have just heard at Stanley falls some 500 miles further into the interiorand the Valley of the Congo than the station last mentioned To reach this remote point Mr Stanley must have passed through the most dangerous part of the river studded as are its richly wooded banks and islands with those tribes through which he and his fol lowers had to run the gauntlet seven years ago Beyond the equator the river expands in many places to a great width its channel is studded with innumerable islands and its shores fringed with an almost endless series of villages some of the inhabitants of which were found to be armed with muskets There is for example the famous village built of ivory the ferocious tribe at Magala and the  amiable people of Bubunga But above all Mr Stan ley must have succeeded in passing safely the mouth of the great river Aruwimi where the naval battle occurred in February 1877 so graphically described in his narrative and represented in his sketch The Stanley falls at which the new station has been planted are seven cataracts which form the first interrup tion to the navigation below Nyangwe memorable for the tragedy witnessed by poor Livingstone It was between Nyangwe and the Stanley falls that the treacherous Tibbu Tib deserted Mr Stanley just as the expedition was enter ing the country of reputed cannibals Until Mr Stanley furnishes us with details of his journey up the river we cannot say how far he has been successful in winning the goodwill of the people whose villages fringe its banks But if we may judge from his success up as far as B616b6 there is every reason to expect that it has not been less between that and Stanley falls True we hear rumors of hostilities and rebellions but as these come solely from French and Portuguese sources they require confirmation to put it mildly It is not to be expected that Mr Stanley 139140 Receint D2evelopments in Central Africa has accomplished his beneficent and hazardous mission without some display of force but let us hope that this has been more passive than active By the planting of this last station Mr Stanley may be said to have crowned and completed the mission with which he was intrusted by the King of the Belgians Beyond the Stanley falls we know that the river is navigable to near Nyangwe where it is still something like a mile wide There is at least one fall to the north of Nyangwe and we fear more than one between that and Lake Moero and what now remains to be done is to trace definitely the upper course of the river and its numerous branches many of which are at present conjectural Perhaps the station at Stan ley falls may be made the base of further explorations though it is to be hoped that the German expedition under Dr Wissmann will do much to complete the work of Livingstone Stanley and Cameron Meantime Mr Stanley himself has resolved before re turning to Europe to break up entirely new ground and solve a problem for which geographers at least will be grateful He intends in fact to do what General Gordon would have done had he not just when about to start for the Congo been diverted to Khartoum Mr Stanley intends we are curtly told to reach one of the Egyp tian stations in the Mambuttu country on the Welle Makua One of the great problems of African hydrogra phy is the course of this WelleMakua often referred to as Schweinfurths Welle Mr Stanley himself was con fident that the great northern tributary of the Congo the Aruwimi at the mouth of which occurred the naval engagement referred to above was the WVelle of Schwein furth and gave what seemed to him at the time cogentand the Valley of the Congo reasons for his belief But within the last four years an able Russian explorer Dr Junker has been at work in this region and the latest results of his explorations have just reached this country He has had his head quarters in the BahrGazelle province ruled over by Lup ton Bey and thence has made several journeys to the south and southwest No one therefore is better entitled than he to express an opinion on the hydrography of the region He is convinced that the Welle does not belong to the Congo basin at all but that it flows into the Shari the great feeder of Lake Chad The Welle rises in the hilly region to the northwest of Albert Nyanza where many other streams have their source So far as Dr Junker has observed it receives only two considerable tributaries from the north although it is of great width and studded with islands On the south it is fed by one large affluent the Bomokandi which itself rises quite close to the Welle and runs for a long way parallel with the main river This Bomokandi how ever is fed by many tributaries from the watershed which lies at a considerable distance to the south The water shed Dr Junker is evidently of opinion is that which separates the system of the Congo from that of the Shari and Lake Chad Although like many other African water partings it is scarcely distinguishable yet it seems to separate two regions of very different characteristics Dr Junker had heard of a large river the Nepoko to the south of this waterparting and determined to visit it This he did and reached it after four days travel to the south of the Bomokandi at which he conjectured to be about the middle of its course It was almost equal in size to the Bomokandi and had evidently travelled a long way 141Recent Developments in Central Africa from the east Instead of the many fine trees which every where clothe the banks of the rivers belonging to the Welle system on the north the Nepoko and its tributaries flow through broad flat swamps A floating vegeta tion very similar to what is met with in the Nile pervades the swamps and renders them passable for men but not for animals Dr Junker concludes his remarks by identifying the Nepoko with the Aruwimi of Stanley and in another communication hopes to adduce proof that the Welle is the upper source of the Shari It is not to be expected that Mr Stanley has heard of Dr Junkers discoveries so that he is likely to start under the impression that the Aruwimi will lead to the Welle That is of little consequence If he succeeds in traversing the country which lies between the Congo and the Mombuttu country he will help meterially to fill up a blank in the map of Africa One of Lupton Beys ex plorers a year or two ago discovered a large lake far to the west of Albert Nyanza across which there is a considerable traffic in European goods Whether this lake belongs to the Congo water system or to that of Lake Chad remains to be discovered but it looks as if the Nepoko ran through it We should say that Cassati a recent Italian explorer in the same region attaches the Nepoko to the Welle The Welle region seems to be thickly populated with a great variety of broken tribes belonging mainly to the Mombuttu stock It is worthy of remark that through out these latitudes neither to the east nor to the west did Dr Junker find any definite territory occupied by the dwarfish people so often referred to under the name of Akka The people were certainly met with in many parts but without any fixed settlement wandering about as 142and the Valley of the Congo nomads among the other peoples When Dr Junker despatched the letters from which we have obtained this information he intended to make still another journey to the southwest A short communication from him dated October 1883 states that he had then returned from this journey but would not attempt to transmit his many charts and ethnographical collections to Europe on account of the troubles in the Soudan The probability is that he may take refuge in the south where he has made many friends and so it is not unlikely that he may meet with Mr Stanley as the latter pursues his journey beyond the Congo c W E FORSTER M P ON THE TREATY To the Editor of the Times SIR I venture to trouble you with a few words on the muchdiscussed Congo Treaty in consequence of the tele gram in The Times of Saturday stating that the Senate of the United States has passed a resolution recognizing the International Africa Association on the Congo river and intended as a protest against the AngloPortuguese Treaty There are many disputed questions involved in this treaty but I imagine there will be a general concurrence with Lord Granvilles statement in his despatch on March 15 of last year to M DAntas the Portuguese Minister that there could be no advantage in concluding a treaty which would not be accepted by other Powers whose accep tance would be indispensable before it could come into operation  and Lord Granville rightly argues that  Por tugal would be in no way benefited if England were to 143Recent Developments in Central Africa stand alone in her recognition The result of such isolated action would be that English traders would probably place themselves under the flag of a nation withholding its recog nition and the engagement between the two countries would be absolutely unproductive See Parliamentary Paper 1884 p 14 M DAntas indeed in his reply to this despatch states that the Portuguese Government has not the slightest fear the sovereignty of Portugal the treaty once made with Great Britain would not be recognized by any other nation and adds that France Holland and Germany have more or less explicitly recognized these rights of sover eignty and I gather from many statements in the public press that this assertion by the Portuguese Government is taken for granted but facts do not appear to me to war rant this conclusion First let me observe that a recognition of Portugals rights of sovereignty does not necessarily imply such con currence with the treaty as Lord Granville considered indispensable but as regards the sovereignty what is the information we gain from the diplomatic correspondence  First take Holland The Dutch have important factories on the Congo M DAntas gives as proof of the acknowl edgment of their sovereignty by the Dutch Government a despatch in January of last year in which the Dutch Min ister claims the most favored nation clause but this claim begins with these words It the Dutch Government hopes that Portuguese authority once established in these regions viz the banks of the Congono special immu nity will be granted to any other nation Now in all discussions with regard to this treaty it must be kept in mind that the Portuguese authority is not estab 144and the Valley of the Congo lished on the Congo Probably this is the first commer cial treaty which is based not on facts but on possibilities A few days ago Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice in reply to a question I asked him in Parliament informed me that  no portion of the territory in question is in the occupation of Portugal or under her rule I need not say that the treaty does not establish Portu guese authority though it does sanction a claim of sov ereignty which hitherto we have persistently denied over chiefs whose independence we have acknowledged by numerous treaties and I must here express my surprise that sanction has been given to the destruction of this inde pendence without any attempt even to ascertain the feel ings of these chiefs but I do not wish to dwell in this letter on this part of the question I am now dealing with facts rather than with our duty and so far as I can learn the facts are that the natives are strongly adverse to Portuguese rule and as regards Hol land that the Dutch Government is unfettered by any past admission until or unless the Portuguese invasion be com pleted and that there is judging from the Dutch news papers a strong feeling in Holland against the Treaty We already know the views of the Americans who though they have no factories on the Congo have a growing trade with the natives on its banks There remains France Lord Granville in his rejoinder to M DAntas of June 1 uses these words I will only add in conclusion that the information in possession of Her Majestys Government as to the general recognition by other countries of the sovereignty of Portugal over the territory on the West Coast with which the convention deals does not support the view of Senhor Serpa who considers that he may lay claim to the recognition of France M ChallemelLacour in a recent conversation with Her Majestys Ambassador at Paris distinctly denied that the pretensions of Portugal to that part of the coast are admitted by France 145146 Recent Developments in Central Africa Lord Granville concludes this despatch with this weighty statement  I refer to this as showing that the argument of which I made use in my note of the 15th March as to the futility of a mere dual arrangement between the two countries unrecognized by other Powers is strongly fortified by this statement of the views of the French Government It is to be hoped how ever that the assent of all civilized Powers would be accorded to the pro visions of such a convention as that now under consideration This is the last allusion to foreign Powers by Lord Gran ville in the diplomatic correspondence lately presented to Parliament and as there is no mention in the treaty of the concurrence of other Powers I can only suppose that our Government imagined and hoped that its terms would in themselves secure their assent But is this the case The Dutch traders object as strongly on commercial grounds as do the Liverpool merchants and the Manchester manufacturers We know the view taken in the United States and I see it constantly stated that there are still strong objections in France to the Treaty Surely then the views of the other Powers interested should be officially ascertained before the treaty be ratified Let me make one remark on the American resolution as telegraphed by your correspondent It is stated that this resolution recognizes the International African Association on the Congo river and I am informed that the United States Government will at once recognize its flag What ever comes of the treaty with Portugal there would to my mind be many advantages in our Government taking the same course but I will not now dwell upon them All that I now wish to press through your columns is that facts as they stand strongly enforce Lord Granvilles declaration that the acceptance by other Powers of the Congo Treaty is indispensable before it comes into operaand the Valley of the Congo tion that there is reason to believe that at present this acceptance by other Powers is not forthcoming and that therefore the ratification of the treaty should at any rate be delayed I am Sir your obedient servant W E

at Congo after having chosen a convenient location for ones affairs the chiefs who are entitled to receive the duties or taxes are called These taxes are in reality rents as the negroes do not sell their lands and do not give them up except for an annual or monthly pay ment The tenant has therefore a right to his land just so long as he pays his tax or rent wiich consists besides the payment of installation of rations to the king amount ing to a gallon of rum and eight yards of cotton cloth at the end of every month and the persons whom the king is obliged to supply and for whom he is responsible are Lingster translator comprador purchaser mafuca body servant and four servants mocas The duty of a ling 147148 Recent Developments in Central Africa ster in a factory is to attend to the payment for produce serve as interpreter in communicating with the natives and keep his employer well informed with regard to the busi ness done by his neighbors The comprador serves to measure the produce settle all difficulties arising from such measurements and withdraw from each measure the count age tax going to the king This countage consists of a plate of grain for every measure of the same and about one or two gallons of oil to every measure of the same which are set apart until there is sufficient to be measured when the king goes to receive it The mafuca oversees the work of the servants and takes the place of the interpreter during the latters absence If one of these seven per sonages should for any reason whatever run away the king is obliged to return him or replace him or lose all rights to his rations taxes c until he has replaced the runaway and paid the robbery if the departure be in con sequence of robbery The manners and customs which have been introduced among the negroes by certain Europeans have rendered it impossible to trade with the natives without corredores These act as couriers who for a certain payment and a supply of gin and spirits lay in wait for the natives along the routes they take when bringing in produce for trade and conduct them to the employers factory It often occurs that the negroes follow these corredores of their own free will but it happens also that the negroes when they will not follow them are forced to go to the house of the employers or when the corredor knows there is not a cer tain kind of goods at his factory and conducts the negroes or trade to another merchants factory he is in like manner bound by the slaves of his employer for although slaveryand the Valley of the Congo is abolished there is any number of slaves to be found some in chains and others at liberty in the Portuguese houses as also in some foreign houses so that the corredor becomes the slave of the white man unless his family is willing to pay an exorbitant price for his liberty These abuses and violences are very often the reason why the trade route is often closed as the natives alarmed at the constant violence of the kroboys straggling along the routes who hinder their free movements have almost aban doned the Congo and go to sell their produce where they can move about freely or they remain in their villages where they cultivate only what is requisite and sufficient for their families This is the reason why the Congo on account of violence and injustice from being one of the most productive rivers ten years ago has become compara tively speaking completely abandoned by the natives The purchase of slaves continues at the values of 5 or 6 each When they cannot be bought they are obtained in the following manner An article or object of some kind is laid aside out of the way but within reacl of the negro who at once steals it and being taken inflagrante delicto becomes at once a slave If he is a person of importance and is claimed by his relatives or by the chiefs of the vil lage to which he belongs he is sometimes given up in exchange for two or three slaves who take his place and lose thereby the liberty they enjoyed to become slaves in their village these are put in chains and made to work under the lash and the rod Should any Government therefore seriously wish to correct or avoid any further slavery in chains bondage and unjust punishments and secure free trade and make the Congo as productive as it was about ten or fifteen years ago the following must be 149150 Recent Developments in Central Africa attended to The corredores are the principal causes of the lack of trade for besides the wages which they receive and which can be given to the native trader they embezzle the funds intrusted to their care Some houses have more than 200 corredores they receive a certain number of counters with numbers corresponding to numbers with the name of the corredor entered in a book expressly kept for the purpose at the fetiche the place where the trade is car ried on and settled the corredor generally receives 20 markers or counters for each case of gin or demijohn of spirits each counter represents a measure The corredor is present at the measuring and accompanies the native trader who receives an order for every measure that he measures at the fetiche the corredor takes notes of these orders and sends a counter with each one which is kept in a drawer until the number is complete If the negro has done much trade through the intervention of the lingster who pays in the fetiche he will embezzle so much per measure If the white man does not consent to this rob bery the negro is robbed of like amount when passing through the village of the corredor and the corredor pays himself by not giving an account of the goods which he received to attract trade and then goes to some other mer chant The kroboys are then immediately sent out on the different traderoutes and the corredor is in a very short time taken and put in irons The chief of the village is then made responsible for the corredor and must pay for him If the chief takes no notice of it men or women belonging to the same village are tied and made to keep with the corredor who is in chains The king and chiefs of the village are likewise responsible for the kroboys of the white man if any of them run away For the simple reaand the Valley of the Congo son of the kroboys having passed through a village the inhabitants thereof although wholly innocent are put in chains and remain in chains until the kroman is returned and until the villages through which he passed have paid for him This is the way affairs are carried on at present on the Congo and how slaves are procured at a moderate price while it is publicly proclaimed at the same time that slavery is abolished L DE R Du VERGE Consul UNITED STATES CONSULATE St Paul de Loando 1883 VI RECENT INFORMATION FROM

exploration in the region of the Great Lakes arrived in Kar6ina at the beginning of December 1883 and 151152 Recent Developments in Central Africa that he intends remaining until the end of the rainy

remembrance and gratitude I arrived here a month and a half ago and am resting from my past fatigues in the comupany of the excellent Mr Storms whose temperament and cheerfulness are not likely to give way under the annoyances of this horrid continent I could fill pages should I attempt to speak to you of the frank and cordial hospitality that up to this time I have received from your agents At Zanzibar Captain Cambier has so to say fitted up my expedition here Mr Storms is giving me a powerful aid in reorganizing it Should I meet on the Congo towards which I am directing my steps any more of yourand the Valley of the Congo hospitable stations instead of my remaining the organizer of my expedition it will then become the work of the officers to whom you have had the kindness to recom mend me My voyage although comparatively speaking very fortu nate so far has failed to produce the results I anticipated At Bang6elo where I expected to see a lake I found but an immense marsh through which I waded for nearly a month The Luapula which geographers say comes from the northwest of the lake flows in a precisely opposite direction I navigated it with the eight men who manned my boat whilst the rest of my caravan went by land to wait for me at Cazembes From that day there began for me a life of misery which lasted as far as Tanganyika The Luapula as I said before flows from the south of the lake and before taking the direction which it follows to the Lunda runs for more than 100 miles to the Southwest It is at the elbow formed by these two directions that I was stopped short one day a few hundred metres from the powerful cataract of Mombottouta Harassed for the past three days on both shores by a thousand howling natives ready to fall upon me I could do nothing with my eight men cut off as I was by this great cataract I had to surrender and abandon onehalf of my material and my unfortunate boat To think that I had crossed in it the Oussagara had carried it over the whole range of the moun tains to the north of the Nyassa and that after scarcely twentyfive days of navigation I was compelled to abandon it It was heartrending  The day I had to leave it was without exception the saddest of my voyage I was taken to MereMere chief of the Nonaoumis who lives say ten days journey towards the north in about 153Recent Developments in Central Africa the latitude of

short duration Cazembe taking advantage of my absence had seized half the guns of my men Emboldened by my powerlessness he compelled me to buy ivory with the four unfortunate loads of stuffs which were left me Half disarmed without provisions I plunged in the pori as I declared war against him I remained there one month and a half be fore reaching Tanganyika feeding my men with the game I killed on the way During all that time my men who behaved bravely could not find a single handful of flour to buy Itahona which is very thinly populated is now desolated by a frightful famine Moero upon which I passed four days shooting and fishing is a large fine lake well encased between its two shores At Tenduc where I reached Tanganyika I found two English missionaries who facilitated me as much as it was in their power in sending all my people to Karema I had suffered much it is true but at Karema one recovers from everything The station has cost you many sacrifices but you may well be proud of it If the Association maintains there a permanent agent there is no doubt that within twenty years Karema will have completely supplanted Ujiji and Unyaniembe Besides the comfort and improvements brought to the station by travellers the position of Kar6ma through the gradual receding of the lake will become un rivalled on lake Tanganyika I have taken a few photo 154and the Valley

Storms is not less fortunate He intends writing to you about it We are two wonders in the centre of this dreaded Africa Why does not the Association abandon the pestiferous route of Unyaniembe the only unhealthy place in tropical Africa with the exception of the coasts the more so that you have another one superb and just as short by Uhihe Usasa and Fipa Unyaniembe is close by The day when the station shall need it it will be but childs play to send a caravan there Pardon me for giving you my advice so frankly upon such a matter If I take the liberty to do so it is because I am personally convinced that it is owing to my having avoided the Unyaniembe route that I have not had occasion to swallow two gTains of quinine since I left the coast I intend remaining at Karema until the middle of March I am expecting at present a caravan which I sent to Unya niembe for revictualling which will enable me first to return to Mr Storms the stuffs which he lent me and then to resume my voyage

UP THE CONGO TO STANLEY FALLS These extracts are somewhat meagre but they enable us to supplement the information already given with a few details of interest Mr Stanley left Leopoldville on August 23 last and after touching at intermediate points reached Equator Station on September 29 Here he remained till October 17 when he embarked with M Roger and 68 men on board three steamers and a whaleboat At Uranga a large village on the left bank at the mouth of the important river Lulemaga an alliance was made with the natives Similar alliances accompanied with exchange of blood were made with the chief at Bangala Rubunga left bank and Yambinga north bank which the flotilla reached on November 8 The crisis of the voyage occurred on November 15 when the party reached the mouth of the dreaded Aruwimi where the great river fight took place on Mr Stanleys first journey Anchor was cast on the right bank in front of the villages from which numerous war canoes sallied forth The great war drums were beaten and the banks were covered with armed men but only two canoes approached the steamers Mr Stanleys party established their camp on the edge of the river and quietly remained in full view smoking After about an hours anxious waiting Mr Stanley went on board and the three steamers passed in front of the villages at about 50 yards distant The effect was magical 156and the Valley of the Congo the noisy steam rushing out of the funnels the revolutions of the paddles the agitation of the water the rapidity of progress without the use of oars the white men on the cabin roofs sending words and gestures of peace and friendshipall completely nonplussed the simple and bar barous people A complete understanding was estab lished and for two days negotiations were carried on The people told Stanley that Arabs from the Soudan visited them and sold them pearls and that on the other side of the Congo there was a warlike tribe the Bahunga who attacked them and killed many of their people Before leaving Mr Stanley steamed some distance up the Aruwimi The river in population was savage but not hos tile At the village of Yambunga lat 2 13 N the naviga tion is obstructed by rapids so that it is found the Aruwimi will be of little service as a trade route The river is here known as the Bi yere further up the Berre and then the Werre which Mr Stanley thinks is evidently Schwein fuths Welle But we showed the other day that Dr Junker has all but proved that the Welle joins the Shari and that the Nepoko on the South of the watershed is probably the Upper Aruwimi Proceeding up the Congo Mr Stanley met with a flotilla of about 1000 canoes on the 24th of November but they made no hostile demonstration Still further up the Mawembe villages were found to be devastated and burnt and the poor remains of the people crowded on the banks ready to migrate westwards An armed band had attacked the villages the previous night killed many of the men and carried off the women and children as slaves On December 1 the Stanley falls were reached and the natives were soon conciliated This station the farthest inland on 157158 Recent Developments in Central Africa the Congo was established on the north shore of Wana Rusani Island which stretches into the middle of the river The island is fertile and healthy with about 1500 inhab itants and easy of access both from below and above It is situated about 10 miles north of the equator and about a couple of miles below the first of the Stanley falls The chiefs all accepted the flag of the Association After erecting the station buildings and leaving one of his lieu tenants in charge with thirty Zanzibaris and Houssas Mr Stanley began his return journey on December 10 Several other points were touched at and treaties concluded But at more than one place Mr Stanley had to settle difficulties which had arisen between the chiefs of the station and the natives and in one case at least had to depose one of his lieutenants for indiscreet conduct It is to be wished we had been favored with further details as to their troubles which it may be feared are sometimes serious indeed if the reports from Portuguese and French sources are to be trusted some of the employees of the Association must be more than indiscreet At present it is impossible to obtain an accurate idea of the real state of matters Mr Stanley returned to Leopoldville on January 20 last after an absence of four months twentysix days completely exhausted Meantime M de Brazza has not been idle According to last reports he was at Brazzaville had concluded many treat ies with petty chiefs between the Congo and Gaboon and was seeking for a more direct route than that of the Alima and the Ogove between the Congo and the French posses sions He had already created twentytwo stations between Cape Lopez and Brazzaville and intended to create ten more The Ogove had been completely surveyed as well as the country between that river and the Alimaand the Valley of the Congo While Mr Stanley as the agent of the International African Association has been reexploring and planting stations on the Lower and Middle Congo as far as Stanley falls another explorer has been working from the other end of the great artery with a view if possible of complet ing our knowledge of the river from its source to the sea This explorer is a young French midshipman M V Giraud who left Zanzibar in December 1882 direct for Lake Bang weolo on the swampy shore of which at Ilala Livingstone died on his knees M Giraud has made good use of his time and a letter from him has been received at Brussels dated from the Belgian station at Karema on the east shore of Lake Tanganyika January 14 1884 The fact that a letter has been able to reach Europe from the heart of Africa in three months is surely a sign of rapid progress even so recently as Livingstone s days we could hardly have hoped to have received such a communication in less than a year 159

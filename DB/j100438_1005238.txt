Jan 15 1841 LAMARCK in describing the genus Melania says that they are nearly all exotic In fact he does not mention a single species as inhabiting the rivers of Europe In the United States we find a great number distributed over a wide geogra phical range from the Columbia River to the St Lawrence Separating Mr Says genus Anculosa from Melania we have remaining described by him and other Zoologists about sixty species which with the fiftyseven now pro posed will make the large number of about one hundred and seventeen species known to inhabit the waters of the United States The waters of Tennessee seem particularly productive of the different forms of this genus and I have no doubt that many new ones will be added to the catalogue as we have nume rous ardent and industrious naturalists labouring in the field of investigation The greater part of the species which I now propose it will be observed were collected by Dr Troost who in his Geological Survey of the state of Ten nessee during several years gave attention enough to its Natural History to enable us to add largely to the Mollusca already known Mr S M Edgar and Dr Currey assistant geologists in that survey have also obliged me by the use of their specimens As the indigenous and exotic species of the genus Melania now known are so numerous I propose to divide them into sections comprising 1 The Smooth 2 The Plicate 3 The Carinate viii2 R 4 The Sulcate 5 The Striate 6 The Tuberculate 7 The Granulate 8 The Cancellate 9 The Spinose164 DEESCRIPTION OF SECTION ISMOOTH MELANIE MELANIA HILDRETHIANA Plate 5 Fig

small elliptical purple Hab Maury County Tenn Thos R Dutton My Cabinet and Cabinet of T R Dutton Diam 25 Length 67 of an inch RemnarksThis species is remarkable for its clubshaped form It differs from the claveformis herein described in having a less pointed apex in being a smaller species and in being of a darker colour The first three or four whorls are carinate and disposed also to be striate and plicate The aperture is about onethird the length of the shell The three individuals before me are entirely purple inside and this gives a very dark appearance to the shellNEW FRESH WATER AND LAND

noticed It was found by Mr Nicklin in a small stream of cold water at the Hot Springs in Virginia It is amongst the smallest species I have seen The purple colour of the interior of most of the specimens gives the shell a very dark appearance I owe to the kindness of Mr Nicklin to whom I dedi cate it the possession of several specimens of this species I am under obli gations to him also for a fine suite of M inflata nobis They were found in New River Va being that part of the great Kanawha which is above its junc tion with the Gauley River Some of the specimens have longer spires some are lineolate some banded and others are without bands Thus presenting characters differing so much as almost to deceive one as to their being iden tical  Since the above was written I have received from Dr Warder of Cincinnati a specimen from New River which with a reexamination of Mr Nicklins specimens satisfies me that the shell described by Mr Conrad in the appendix to his  Fresh Water Shells of the United States under the names of M Rogersii and dilatata are identical with my inflata my description bearing date the previous year to his Within a few days I have observed in the Boston

Ohio T G Lea My Cabinet and Cabinets of T G Lea and P H Nicklin Diam 30 Length 37 of an inch RemarksThis is a fine species about the size of Melania subglobosa Say Anctulosa and it has been confounded with it I have specimens of subglobosa wlhich were brought by Prof Vanuxem from the Holston at the time he gave new species of Anculosa by Mr Anthony Anculotus carinatus and Anculotus Kirtlandianus both from the falls of the Kanawha Judging from the description and figures I am led to the conclusion that both these were identical with M inflata anid from the great variety of this proteus species I am not sur prised at its being mistaken The peculiar character however of the angle and channel of the base in this species is evident throughout I am not aware of the animal having been yet observed when ex amined it may prove to be a true Anculosa If so the synonymy will stand thus Anculosa inflata Lea Melania dilatata Conrad Melania Rogersii Conrad Anculotus carinatus Anthony Anculotus

there is a single one it gives the shell the appearance of being carinate as it appears near the centre of the whorl In some specimens these strih are more numerous in a single one I have counted fifteen There appear to be no bands on the outside but sometimes purple lines on the inside mark the places of the exterior striae There is generally more or less colour in the interior and about the

where it exists in abundance It may generally have been confounded with M depygis Say When I procured it I placed it in my cabinet under that name with a mark of doubt It is a smaller shell than the depygis lias a shorter spire and a narrower aperture This species has a purple columella and interior which in some cases are very dark The specimens procured were all more or less eroded and the apex removed The number of whorls is either six or seven The aperture is nearly half the length of the shell  Since the above was written I have seen in the Boston Journal of Science the description and

impression above and distinct from the great anterior cica trix This is nearly round and penetrates the base of the cardinal tooth It may be that it is formed by a branch of the anterior adductor muscle An examination of the animal only can decide this point In the above descrip tion it will be observed that the anterior cicatrices are described as being con fluent This alludes to the cicatrices of the adductor muscle and the muscle of locomotion as usual The third cicatrix of the anterior part is now I believe for the first time observed lThe dorsal and basal margin are nearly

find a marked distinction in nearly all the different species respec tively inhabiting the waters east and west of the mountains as I have elsewhere observed For many years I have been exceedingly desirous of obtaining the shells inhabiting the approximating waters which fall respectively into the Atlantic on one side and the Gulf of Mexico east of the Mississippi on the other The Chattahoochee

small nacre white and beautifully iridescent RemarksSince I described the U cucumoides from New South Wales I have received the above described species from Dr Von den Busch and by his kindness I am permitted to place it in my Cabinet It is certainly among the most curious and interesting species which have been observed The duplex form of the wirng is very remarkable The early growth rises almost perpen dicularly above the beaks to a point the succeeding growth forming its sym phynote fold in a horizontal line sets off much below the apex of the first growth The whole presents tile appearance of a part being broken out This however is by no means the case It is a character and we may observe it in a less degree but still in a perfect manner in the very young of the U laevissimus nobis which usually if not always at the second growth on the wing takes a new starting point to form the fold over the ligament The cardinal teeth are very remarkable presenting but a small cleft while the crenulations fill up the space connected with the lateral tooth in this resembling the Iridina The margin anterior to the beaks presents the appearance of there having been a wing Immediately before the cardinal tooth there is a remarkable angular notch in the nacre filled up with laminated epidermal matter The anterior cicatrices have the peculiarity mentioned in the U cucumoides but the three cicatrices are here perfectly distinct The epidermis is minutely striate over most of the disk but over the middle part and on the wing there may be observed with a lens nurrmerous very remarkable minute round granulations Dr Von den Busch informs me that he obtained this shell from his friencd Mr Gruner who from  its similarity withi a dolphin proposed the name of delphinus which I have adopted As the vessel which brouglht this shell also visited some of the islands of the Indian Ocean Mr Gruner thinks there may be some doubt of its inhabiting New Ilolland

Paper on Fresh Water and Land Shells Read February 19th 1841 IN a paper read before the Society July 15th 1837 I gave the result of some observations made in regard to the anatomy gestation and geographical distri bution of the family Naiades and I mentioned at the time that it was my inten tion to pursue the subject Circumstances however have prevented my undertaking the thorough examination of the habits of the species and their structure which I intended At my request however my brother T G Lea has made some valuable observations during the last three years at Cincinnati where these shells are numerous and the size often large A digest of these observations has been nmade by him and the result though not entirely satis factory will make some advance towards a knowledge of the periods of some of the species Sexual difference is no longer a matter of doubt but the period and mode of impregnation as well as the length of gestation and the time of parturition are either unknown or but partially understood At page 52 Vol 6 of the Transactions I mentioned having seen in a single instance the ejectment of a number of sacciform oviducts in quite a rapid succession from the Unio complanatus Dr Kirtland has since as he informs me by letter  twice seen the females of Unio cylindricus throw off their ova per saltum or with a kind of jet The portions discharged were collections of a vast number of individuals aggregated in oblong masses conforming with the shape of the cells of the ovarium Soon after they were discharged they appeared to crumble to pieces and the several individuals fell down among the sand These observations corroborate mine and we may conclude that we have one fact established in two species in regard to parturition The Anodontc2 so far as I have been able to observe them are ovoviviparous but whether they as some species of the Uniones do attach themselves when young by a byssus I have not had the means to determine

they were not except in the single specimen of Unio lEsopus If the ovaria had been examined no doubt the ova would have been found in all of them exclusive of sulcatus pileus and formosus They were all taken from September 19th to November 13th 1838 In column No 2 many of the species contained in column No 1 were examined again in the Autumn of 1839 and found to have ova in the ovaria and none in the oviducts The others in column No 1 that I had not an oppor tunity to examine would I think have been found in the same condition Tr this column it may be observed that U parvus and lachrymosus had ova in the ovaria in March also a single specimen of U rubiginosus taken at Waynesville in July As this was not as advanced as six others taken at the same time their period is probably irregular Column No 3 contains the species observed with the oviducts charged with young in the Autumn of 1838 and 39  Column No 4 contains the species with oviducts charged with young at various periods of 1840In columns No 1 and 2 no ova were found in the oviducts  I have not been able to come to a satisfactory conclusion respecting the ges tation and period at which the Uniones discharge their young that it varies between some groups of the species I have no doubtFor instance take all those in columns No 1 and 2 which late in the Autumn have no ova trans ferred to the oviducts while other groups in columns No 3 and 4 have the oviducts charged with young at the same season The latter probably dis charge in the Spring or early Summer and the former later In coluinn No 2 is a U plicatus with ova in the ovarium in Autumn in No 4 is one with ova in the ducts in July Suppose this to have discharged in August it makes a very long gestation  In column No 4 is a U circulus with ova in the oviducts in March and another with ova in the oviducts in July The same species also in column No 3 with ova in the oviducts in Autumn From this I would infer that it is irregular or breeds more than once a year In column No 4 is a U lute olus with ova in the oviducts in March in August and in October Some that I observed in August had their branchie so swollen that they could not shut the valves close In this case the animal would have discharged in aNEW FRESH WATER AND LAND SHELLS 233 short time The same inference applies to this as to circulus Of U occidens in column No 4 you will see the same in March and October  Few of the species in columns 1 and 2 were found with ova in the oviducts This is owing to the period at which they must be transferred from the ovarium which most likely is in the spring I have observed them until the end of November After that our river continues too high to take them until July or August In the interval the young must be perfected and discharged By reference to my notes you will find the above facts in detail The columns are arranged and generalized from them My observations in 183839 and 40 are included in them and only differ as the economy of the species itself may differ There will not be found any contradiction  The ovarium constitutes much the largest portion of the body It lies im mediately above the foot forming all the solid part of the body between it and the viscera In a letter I sent you November 26th 1838 were three views of a U mueltiplicatus the ovarium extending from the superior part of the foot nearly to the intestinal canal and from behind and a little below the stomach to the connexion of the posterior muscle forming with the exception of the foot the larger portion of the whole body The integuments are thick and on lay ing it open it has a fibrous interior with a gelatinous substance in which are dissemirnated numerous ova  You will find in the notes sent to you in 1838 a description of both lobes of the branchie on each side of two specimens of U multiplicatus being charged In the other specimens examined but one lobe on each side was charged as usual In another examination in September 1839 both lobes were charged Thus it appears they vary in this species as they probably do also in U rnbii nosus  UNIO SAPOTALENSIS Plate 21 Fig 47 Testa elliptica subinflatd incequilaterali postice subbiangulatdt

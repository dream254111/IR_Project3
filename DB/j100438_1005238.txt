JAN 15 1841 LAMARCK IN DESCRIBING THE GENUS MELANIA SAYS THAT THEY ARE NEARLY ALL EXOTIC IN FACT HE DOES NOT MENTION A SINGLE SPECIES AS INHABITING THE RIVERS OF EUROPE IN THE UNITED STATES WE FIND A GREAT NUMBER DISTRIBUTED OVER A WIDE GEOGRA PHICAL RANGE FROM THE COLUMBIA RIVER TO THE ST LAWRENCE SEPARATING MR SAYS GENUS ANCULOSA FROM MELANIA WE HAVE REMAINING DESCRIBED BY HIM AND OTHER ZOOLOGISTS ABOUT SIXTY SPECIES WHICH WITH THE FIFTYSEVEN NOW PRO POSED WILL MAKE THE LARGE NUMBER OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN SPECIES KNOWN TO INHABIT THE WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES THE WATERS OF TENNESSEE SEEM PARTICULARLY PRODUCTIVE OF THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF THIS GENUS AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT MANY NEW ONES WILL BE ADDED TO THE CATALOGUE AS WE HAVE NUME ROUS ARDENT AND INDUSTRIOUS NATURALISTS LABOURING IN THE FIELD OF INVESTIGATION THE GREATER PART OF THE SPECIES WHICH I NOW PROPOSE IT WILL BE OBSERVED WERE COLLECTED BY DR TROOST WHO IN HIS GEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF THE STATE OF TEN NESSEE DURING SEVERAL YEARS GAVE ATTENTION ENOUGH TO ITS NATURAL HISTORY TO ENABLE US TO ADD LARGELY TO THE MOLLUSCA ALREADY KNOWN MR S M EDGAR AND DR CURREY ASSISTANT GEOLOGISTS IN THAT SURVEY HAVE ALSO OBLIGED ME BY THE USE OF THEIR SPECIMENS AS THE INDIGENOUS AND EXOTIC SPECIES OF THE GENUS MELANIA NOW KNOWN ARE SO NUMEROUS I PROPOSE TO DIVIDE THEM INTO SECTIONS COMPRISING 1 THE SMOOTH 2 THE

THAT IT VARIES BETWEEN SOME GROUPS OF THE SPECIES I HAVE NO DOUBTFOR INSTANCE TAKE ALL THOSE IN COLUMNS NO 1 AND 2 WHICH LATE IN THE AUTUMN HAVE NO OVA TRANS FERRED TO THE OVIDUCTS WHILE OTHER GROUPS

PLANETS AND SUN BY G H BRYAN M A CAMBRIDGE ENGLAND IT was only a week or two before reading Professor Liveings interesting communication in Science that I had made some calculations which led me to adopt the same theory which he has advocated The object of my inves tigations was in fact to show that we could not regard the atmospheres of the different members of the solar sys tem as isolated masses of gas from which molecules might fly off if their speeds were to become sufficiently great but that to account for the very existence of plane tary atmospheres at all it would be necessary to adopt the hypothesis of an atmosphere of excessive tenuity per vading both interplanetary and interstellar space It is unfortunate that Mr Howard did not apply the principle of conservation of energy to the arguments con tained in his letter in the issue of April 28 Had he done so he would have realized that the question as to whether a molecule will permanently leave the atmosphere of the Moon or a planet depends only on its speed irrespective of direction and does not in any way depend on whether the motion takes place in a vertical direction In fact if the kinetic energy of a molecule is greater than the work required to be done against the planets attraction in or der to remove the molecule to an infinite distance the molecule will describe a hyperbola and will fly off never to return again no matter what be its direction of motion provided that it does not come into collision with any other molecule or with the planet itself Again the speed required to leave the Earth is about five times as great as that required to leave the Moon but this is not because the earths attraction is five times as great as the Moons but because the Earths potential is about twentyfive times as great as the Moons conse quently in order to leave the Earth a particle would re quire to have twentyfive times the kinetic energy or five times the speed which it would require to leave the Moon According to the wellknown error law of distribu tion of speed among the molecules of a gas which forms the basis of calculations connected with the kinetic the ory there must always be some molecules moving with sufficiently great speeds to overcome the attraction of any body however powerful and some whose speed is too small to enable them to escape from the attraction of any body however feeb e On this assumption no planet can have an absolutely permanent atmosphere and no planet 3t or satellite which has ever had an atmoslhere could get rid of that atmosphere entirely If however the propor tion of molecules which escape is relatively exceedingly small any changes which occur in the nature of the at mosphere of the planet will take place so slowly that countless ages will have to elapse before they make them selves felt In order therefore to test the relative de gree of permanence of the atmospheres of different celes tial bodies I have calculated what proportion of the mole cules of oxygen and hydrogen at different temperatures have a sufficiently great speed to fly off from the surfaces of and never return to the Moon Mars and the Earth I have also given the corresponding results for the Sun not however at its surface but at the Earths distance from the Suns centre where the critical speed is of course square root of two times the speed of the Earths orbital motion The numbers which are given in Table 1 below repre sent in each case the average number of molecules among which there is one molecule whose speed exceeds the crit ical amount Thus for oxygen at temperature 0C rather over one molecule in every three billion is moving fast enough to fly off permanently from the Moon and only one in every 23x10329 is moving fast enough to es cape from the Earths atmosphere while the Suns attrac tion even at the distance of the Earth prevents more than one in every 2x10491 from escaping When we arrive at such vast numbers as this it might be reasonable to object that we have pushed the kinetic theory a great deal further than it will go The assump tions made in many proofs of the error law of distribu tion certainly preclude its application to high speeds that are so rarely attained Still there is no physical limit to the speed which any individual molecule might acquire in the course of colliding with other molecules As Professor Liveing has pointed out all that would be necessary would be a sufficiently long run of collisions in each of which the line of impact happened to be nearly perpen dicular to the direction in which the molecule in question was previously moving so that each impinging molecule should transfer the greater portion of its energy to that one Imolecule And theory points to the conclusion that whenever there is any law of permanent distribution of the mole cules of a gas that law must be the error law Hence the calculations may be reasonably expected to give a cor rect estimate of the proportion of molecules whose speed exceeds the critical speed provided that the mass of gas under consideration is so large that the total number of such molecules is great however small their relative pro portion may be Thus we are at least justified in regard ing the figures as affording indications of the relative permanency or otherwise of the gaseous envelopes sur rounding different bodies of the solar system One great difficulty presented by the theory is that oe taking account of the differences of temperature of the atmospheres of the different bodies There seems to be good reason for believing that the Moons temperaturf may fall below 200C in which case only one molecule in 7x105 will be able to escape And generally the larger members of the solar systenm are the hotter and this would cause them to part with their atlmospheres more readily in proportion than they would if all the bodies were at one common temperature If the absolute tem peratures of different bodies were proportional to their gravitation potentials the proportion of molecules pos sessing the speed requisite to carry them off would be the same for all This condition would require the Earths atmosphere to have an absolute temperature roughly twentyfive times as high as that of the Moons Even supposing this were the case it does not necessarily December 8 189313x2 SCIENCE follow that the Moons atmosphere would be of as perma nent a nature as the Earths for the gain and loss of molecules would only take place near the upper limits of the atmospheres where collisions rarely occur hence the question of permanency would largely depend upon the extent of the atmospheres surrounding the two bodies The figures tend to show that the Earth would lose its atmosphere very slowly even if plunged in vacuo and that the Suns atmosphere may be regarded as practically permanent even independently of the hypothesis of an interstellar atmosphere But the impossibility of assum ing losses to be taking place from the atmospheres of planets without a compensating accession of molecules from the surrounding space is at once evident when we endeavor to trace the past history of the solar system If the Moon ever had an atmosphere which has now flown off into space losses of a similar nature must neces sarily have taken place in the atmospheres of all the plan ets at a time when they were much hotter than they are at present especially in the case of so small a planet as Mars And if we trace the history of the solar system further and further back we find that if the planets were hotter and hotter they must therefore have been parting with their gaseous envelopes at a greater and greater ratea condition of things which would render it impossible to account for the initial existence of plane tary atmospheres The nebular hypothesis supposes the Sun and planets to have been evolved by the gradual contraction and con densation of a nebulous mass of gas This process would be exactly the reverse of the flyingoff process suggested by a perusal of Dr Robert Balls paper It is only necessary to assume the existence of a distri bution of matter of excessive tenuity pervading interplan etary space in order to account for the permanence of the planetary atmospheres at all temperatures and such an assumption taken in conjunction with the kinetic theory is quite compatible with the absence of any percep tible atmosphere surrounding the Moon The kinetic theory enables us to compare the densities at different points of a mass of gas in equilibrium under fixed central forces such as the attractions of the celes tial bodies If we apply the theory to the system consist ing of the Sun Moon and Earth we shall find the rela tive densities given in Table 2 the density of the corres ponding gas in the atmosphere at the Earths surface be ing taken as unity If we take the density at an infinite distance from the Sun to be unity the corresponding re sults will be given by Table 3 The assumption on which these results are calculated may be called an equilibrium theory since it takes no account of the motions of the bodies in question and it assumes a permanent distribution to have been attained so that the whole of the mass is at a uniform tempera ture When every allowance is made for the artificial charac ter of the assumptions it is still highly unreasonable to suppose that the Moon could have an atmosphere so far in excess of that required by the equilibrium theory that its presence could be detected even by the most careful observations And so far from its being necessary to assume the density of the interplanetary atmosphere to be a millionth of a millionth of the density at the Earths surface we should on the assumption of a uniform temperature of 0QC have to divide the latter density by a million over and over aain fiftyfive times before we had reached the degree of tenuity required by the equilibrium theory for the interplanetary atmosphere in the neighborhood of the Earths orbit Taking the number of molecules in one cubic centimetre of air as a million million million Vol XXII No 566 and employing the figures calculated for oxygen we should have to construct a cube each of whose sides was 10100 kilometres long in order to enclose a hundred molecules of a gas of this degree of tenuity Thus if we multiply a million by a million and repeat the process sixteen times and then multiply by ten thousand and take this number of kilometres as the side of a cube and place one hundred molecules of gas inside it and the Earth in the middle that hundred molecules would be sufficient to make up for any loss that is going on at the surface of the Earths atmosphere It is similarly evident from the figures in Table 1 that countless ages must elapse before a single molecule leaves the Earths atmosphere and that no per ceptible equalization is taking place between the atmos pheres of different planets If we try to compare the atmospheres of different plan ets such as the Earth and Mars the equilibrium theory breaks down completely But it would be highly un reasonable to suppose that anything like a permanent law of distribution existed between two bodies at such vast distances apart separated by a medium of such extreme tenuity and subject to solar radiation and so many other disturbing causes The molecules of gas flying about in interplanetary space are so few and far between that collisions can only rarely take place between them whereas any tendency of approach towards a permanent state of distribution must necessarily depend on fre quency of collisions between the molecules Hence the rate of equalization of energy among the molecules of so diffuse a medium must be infinitesimally slow so slow in deed that practically no such equalization is taking place at all It is different in the case of two bodies so near one another as the Earth and Moon Among the mole cules of gas which at any time might find themselves in the neighborhood of the Moon and Earth the greater number would be drawn in by the more attractive body and the moon would not therefore be likely to obtain more than her fair share of air which as we have seen is very small in comparison with that allotted by the equi librium theory to the Earth Table 3 affords some idea of how the density of the Earths atmosphere would increase with the gradual cooling of the solar system According to this theory a similar increase has been taking place in what little at mosphere there is surrounding the Moon and at no period of its history has it possessed an atmosphere of oxygen and nitrogen comparable in density with that of the Earth A decrease of density in a planets atmos phere could only take place by the condensation in liquid form of vapors present in it not by matter leaving the planet The figures given in Table 3 are more than sufficient to account for the comparative rarity of hydrogen in the Earths atmosphere but a similar argument would also of course require a considerable preponderance of oxygen over nitrogen which is contrary to experience But here again we have pushed the equilibrium theory too far It is highly probable that the number of molecules flying about both in interplanetary and interstellar space is far greater than that given by the accompanying tables and the inference is that the atmospheres of the planets are in creasing in density at a rate far greater than that due to cooling alone Even so however the few molecules picked up by the Earth in the course of a year or even a million years may have no appreciable effect on the density or composition of the atmosphere Hence while as Pro fessor Liveing asserts the same chemical elements may be expected to enter into the constitution of all the celes tial bodies there appears to be no warranty for suppos ing them to be in any way regularly distributed as re gards their relative proportions and on the other handDecember 8 1893 SCIENCE there is every reason for believing that the existing law of distribution may differ vastly from the law of perma nent distributionl required by the kinetic theory of gases

RANGE1 BY C H TYLER TOWNSEND THE range known as the Organ Mountains in south ern New Mexico was determined by the U S Geodetic Survey if I mistake not to rise to a height of 88oo feet above sealevel Ihis altitude has been carefully veried by observations taken by Professor C T Hag erty of the Civil Engineering Department of the New Mexico Agricultural College The western base of the range is about twelve miles to the eastward of Las Cruces in Dona Ana County The range runs nearly north and south for a distance of about twenty miles It varies in width from about four to eight miles the north extremity as well as the south one being much narrower It is intersected a little south of the middle 1Read before the New Mexico Society for the Advancement of Science at Las Cruces April 6 2893 by a wide and detoured pass known as Soledad Cation The San Augustine pass divides the range near its north end About two miles to the north of this pass begin by common consent the San Andres Mountains a lower range which extends on to the northward for about fifty miles About three miles south of San Augustine pass is a rather high and more difficult drop in the range known as Bayler pass The highest peaks of the Organs are north of the centre of the range and their upper portions are mostly bare and nearly inaccessible There is a ridge between the southernmost two peaks and those peaks to the north of them This ridge is probably 8ooo feet or more in elevation and its high est portion is the point to which the zones given below have been traced It dips about 200 feet at its north ern end The altitude at the western base of the range is about 4800 feet or 1000 feet higher than the site of Las Cruces situated twelve to fifteen miles west on the edge of the Rio Grande Valley Thus the above mentioned ridge is roughly speaking about 4000 feet above the surrounding country or about 3 000 feet above the base of the range The various points above mentioned will be better understood by consulting the accompanying diagram of the range It is only a diagram no attempt having been made to secure accuracy of detail It may be stated that to the northeast of the range stretch away the plains of San Augustine while to the northwest is the vast waterless expanse known as the Jornada del Muerto or Journey of the Dead where seventy miles has to be covered between springs To the eastward of the range is a vast level sandy plain which extends some eighty miles to the Sacramento Mountains and plains stretch away likewise to the southeast and for a less distance to the south For some of the beauties of the Organ Mountains I would refer the reader to a paper by Mr Charles H Ames in Appalachia for I892 The point reached by Mr Ames was the lowest part of the ridge above referred to be tween the peaks being the dip at its northern end Beginning at the east bank of the Rio Grande River in the bottom of the valley and going eastward until the highest portion of this ridge between the peaks is reached the following zones in the order given below are encountered The actual ascent to this ridge dur ing which most of the data of the higher zones were carefully noted was made on Nov 12 1892 We left the house at Rileys ranch at 900 A M and reached the highest part of the ridge at about 12 5 P M thus making fully 3000 feet in three and onequarter hours Starting back at 1230 P M  we reached the house again at 255 P M It should be stated that there was much snow in the dense brush through which we passed in the higher portions of the range and that on many occa sions we had to proceed in a reclining attitude over long stretches of smooth rock at an angle of about 350 The house at Rileys ranch is 4900 feet altitude and the ridge as above mentioned about 8ooo feet TornillUo or Cottonwood Zone About 3500 to 3800 feet Characteristic plantsProsopis pubescens tornillo Populus fremontii var wislizeni valley cottonwood Salix spp including S

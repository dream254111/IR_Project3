j100335,The Quarterly Journal of Economics,1883450,Mortgage Taxation in Nebraska,i305284,NOTES AND MEMORANDA 695 MORTGAGE TAXATION IN NEBRASKA UNTIL recently mortgages in Nebraska were assessed in the traditional way when discovered  as personal property The Legislature of 1911 declared mortgages on real property within the State an interest in the land for purposes of taxa tion and made them assessable at the situs of the land to the mortgagee or his assigns The excess in value of the real estate above the mortgage is assessed to the land owner but the mortgagor is permitted by agreement to assume the payment of taxes on the mortgage interest in which case the assessing officer  shall not enter said mortgage for separate assessment and taxation but both interests shall be assessed and taxed to the mortgagor Mortgages other than those secured by Nebraska real estate continue to be treated as personal property but it is provided  that this act shall not apply to corporations the property of which is now exempt from taxation As a matter of practice a very large proportion of the mortgages made since the law went into effect contain the  tax clause  making the mortgagor liable for the payment of taxes on the mortgagees interest as well as his own The purpose of the act of 1911 is indicated in the title To provide for the taxation of mortgages of real property and to prevent double taxation on encumbered property in the state Much was said in the discussion of the bill about  double taxation  the argument was made for the law and more recently for its continuance that it placed the local lender on a footing of equality with the foreign lender but the argument that carried most weight with the legislators doubtless was that the freeing of mortgages from taxation would result in lowering the interest rate on farm mortgages No careful statistical investigation on the effect of the law has been made but such information as there is goes to show that the proportion of domestic to foreign mortgage696 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS loans has risen while the expectation of a fall in the interest rate has not been realized The statistics that have been collected indicate that there has been in fact a slight in crease in Lancaster county and this is probably true through out the state The increase can be accounted for by the general stiffening of the interest rate during the last two years Since a large proportion of the mortgages have long been made to corporations like insurance companies and banks and hence were not assessable separately or were made for export to jurisdictions where their ownership could not be traced it could hardly have been seriously expected by the promoters of the law that the interest rate would fall That had already been fixed before the new law was passed on the basis of practical exemption On the other hand as was expected there has been a falling off of mortgages listed for taxation In 1911 the assessed valuation of this item amounted to 7960000 and in 1912 to 6400000 The assessed valuation is by law onefifth of the true value so that the falling off of 15 million in the assessment roll meant the exemption of 75 millions of  property  hitherto assessed In view of these facts and another feature of the law still to be described a determined opposition to the new system showed itself early in the session of 1913 One of the several bills introduced for the repeal of the law passed the House But a similar one had already failed in the Senate and the upper House refusing assent to the House bill the law of 1911 was left unchanged It is not likely however that the Senate would have voted to retain the law if a case growing out of the statute and then pending in the Supreme Court had been decided This case brings out some curious and unexpected features of mortgage taxation and to its con sideration we now turn While the assessment was in progress the question was raised as to whether Nebraska mortgages held by banks were assessable to the banks It was promptly ruled by the State Board of Equalization and Assessment that they were not that so far as they represented the investment of deposits they should not be assessed to the bank sinceNOTES AND MEMORANDA 697 deposits were by law assessed to the depositors that so far as they represented investment of capital they should not be assessed since their value was already reflected in the value of the capital stock the taxation of which was pro vided for by a section not repealed or modified by the act of 1911 The Board held the view but did not argue it that under the proviso that the act  shall not apply to corporations the property of which is now exempt from taxation the mortgages of banks could not be brought within the law Some of the banks did not accept this ruling The law for the taxation of banks like that of other states provides for a tax in form at least on the shareholders and not on the corporation The Supreme Court of Nebraska has so construed the law But to arrive at the value of the shares the assessor is authorized to deduct from the value of the capital stock the value of its  real estate and other tangible property assessed separately Under this clause the First Trust Company of Lincoln deducted the mortgages owned by it on the ground that they were by the law of 1911 de clared an interest in real estate and assessed separately The district court upheld this view of the law and the Supreme Court shortly after the adjournment of the Legis lature confirmed the decision of the lower court It was held by the higher court that the statute expressly makes the mortgage an interest in the land and that with out the  taxclause  it must be assessed to the bank inde pendently of its capital stock and the deduction was clearly authorized Counsel for the county urged that in case the tax was assumed by the mortgagor the statute specifically provided that the assessor  shall not enter said mortgage for separate assessment or taxation and that the value of such mortgages should in no case be deducted The court held however that when the mortgagor made such an agree ment it must have been in consideration of getting his loan at a lower rate than he otherwise could have secured If 1 First Trust Company of Lincoln v Lancaster County 141 N W Rep 10371038 A second opinion overruling a motion for a rehearing is reported in vol 142 542543698 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS the bank were thus compelled to take a lower rate and not allowed to deduct the mortgage the  double taxation  the law was designed to avoid would follow and the rule of equality in taxation laid down in the constitution would be violated as between individual holders and banks In making this ruling designed to prevent inequality between individuals and banks it seems however that the court has created another kind of inequality of a more serious nature and one that may lead to interesting develop ments  an inequality between different classes of banks The fiscal results of permitting the deduction are not known and cannot for some time be known The capital and sur plus of the State banks however stands at about 20000000 and it is assumed that mortgages of the banks to that amount will in time be offset against practically the whole of this sum This would produce a loss of revenue of about a quarter of a million a year to the treasuries of the State and local governments But the national banks because of the nar rowly prescribed limitations upon their ownership of real estate mortgages can make no such deductions They will have to pay taxes to practically the full value of their capital stock as heretofore When it is remembered how jealously the Federal courts have guarded the national banks against discriminatory taxation under section 41 of the National Bank Act of 1864 it is hardly to be doubted should the question be presented to them that they would hold the advantage to state banks secured by the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Nebraska a violation of the principle of equality guaranteed to the national banks G 0 VIRTUE UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA

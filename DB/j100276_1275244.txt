j100276,Michigan Law Review,1275244,Qualified Martial Law a Legislative Proposal I,i254497,QUALIFIED MARTIAL LAW A IEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL I THE LEGISLATIVE PROBLEM W HEN it is considered that there has been scarcely a year since the beginning of the Government that the Army has not been called upon to quell disturbances too great for the state authorities to handle and that during the last thirtyfive years the state troops have been called out more than five hundred times the extent to which we are dependent upon the military are as a police force may be better realized1 The most serious riots and occasions for socalled Martial Law arise from labor disputes These do not show any tendency to de crease in frequency duration or violence One cause of dangerous friction and of unnecessary violence and bloodshed in protracted strikes repeatedly appears viz the incredible uncertainty as to the legal status and powers of the National Guard of the various states when called out on riot duty and to a lesser degree of the United States troops when called on to protect the state against domestic violence The draft herewith submitted of a uniform state military code has been called forth particularly by the recent occurrences in Colorado West Virginia and Montana where questions as to mili tary powers and abuses have given much trouble and have come be fore the highest courts as well as investigating commissions It would be well for the American people and legislatures to give serious attention to the conflicting views held by military men by courts of law and by workingmen as to martial law and to the dis astrous results of this conflict to all concerned These views the military and the legal should be reconciled if possible by one or both making the proper concessions to the other and a just and certain standard should be authoritatively established If the law as it now stands does not vouchsafe the military adequate powers the law should be amended and their present authority should be in creased If on the other hand there are grave abuses of military power in industrial conflicts as labor generally believes to be the case if military power is used to overawe legitimate industrial pro tests and attempts to better conditions of labor then methods should be devised to restrain these possible abuses in order that economic 1 Federal Aid in Domestic Disturbances p 260 W D 1903QUALIFIED MARTIAL LAW troubles may not be aggravated by the additional irritant of political oppression The state owes it to its citizens tol define much more accurately just how far the military have a right to go and what are the limits and the extent of their powers and duties This duty is owed both to its citizens who are struggling against starvation and other odds for what they regard as their just rights and dues in the division of the products of labor and also to those who are called upon to per form military duty during strikes If military powers under procla mations of martial law be so extensive as military men believe our constitutional guaranties at least the personal ones become mere scraps of paper The tendency towards the arbitrary exercise of power is great wherever power is lodged and the use of the militia in labor disturbances has afforded no exception To the country at large the first essential of the National Guard or organized militia must be readiness for service in war This pro posed code does not deal with that feature nor with methods of organization and military discipline which are already fairly well covered by statute2 It deals primarily with the relations between the military or state police and the citizen which the statutes thus far have not attempted to regulate or to define In order to understand the provisions of the code it will be neces sary to consider the divergent views held with regard to the status of the military which will illustrate the necessity for some such leg islation as that here submitted I Extreme Military View According to the extreme military view absolute martial law may be proclaimed by the executive This means that the will of the commander is law Under this view whatever the soldiers may do under orders is above the law This creates the same situation as military occupation of enemy territory in a public war and those engaged in labor disturbances are to be treated as the public enemy with no legal rights Military men argue that the troops are only called out when local peace officers have failed in the exercise of their powers Control must be gained before anarchy is supreme Hence the military should have the most ample powers to accomplish results in the shortest possible time and all constitutional guaranties must be sus pended The more severe the measures of repression the better the effect on the community 2 See Circulars No 8 and 13 Division of Mil Affairs 1913 as to organization Report of Chief Div Mil Affairs 1914 p 207 I03MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW 2 Radical Labor View This radical view is reciprocal to the extreme military view and holds that the military are to be regarded as the public enemy and to be treated as such It is charged that the military on strike duty are always arrogant oppressors of the poor and tools of capital and tyranny Any state police system should be opposed as a system of American Cossacks designed to uphold Property against Humanity and Liberty Military men are victims of military megalomania The grandeur of epaulets and uniforms the rattle of guns and sabres the ringing of commands the blare of trumpets the spiritstirring drum the earpiercing fife and all the pomp of war turn the head of the erstwhile peaceful militia man with the madness of militarism and the delusion that he is above the law 3 Common Law View The orthodox view is that the military is always in strict subordination to the law Proclamations of mar tial law amount to nothing The military cannot make law or sus pend the constitution The soldier is simply an ordinary peace of ficer whose duty it is to execute and enforce the law The status of the civilian remains the same when the military is called out as before its advent and he has all his rights privileges and immunities under state and federal constitutions 4 Qualified Martial Law The proposed Code is a compromise which has been drafted on the theory of allowing to the military certain increased powers and immunities in time of insurrection but preserving at the same time the supremacy of the law and the constitution The problem is How far to extend military authority beyond that of ordinary peace officers or in another aspect how far military necessity diminishes the normal safeguards and reme dies of civilians The fundamental principle is that of a union be tween responsibility and power Power without responsibility can never be duly controlled Every public officer should have clear and definite authority to do the acts required of him and should be responsible to the law for abuse of power The great body of rights and liberties which have grown up through many centuries of po litical development need not be entirely abandoned on the pretext of military necessity In order to ascertain what is needed in the way of legislation it will be necessary to examine the military view of martial law some what in detail and in connection therewith the military criticism of the powers vouchsafed by the common law We shall inquire what martial law is before we consider the question how far it can and should exist in America 104QUALIFIED MARTIAL LAW II THE MILITARY VIEW OF MARTIAL LAW Mr W F FINLASON an English Lawyer is perhaps the ablest legal advocate of the extreme military view of martial law Ac cording to him martial law is only legal in time of rebellion which amounts to war3 Martial law depends upon the question whether there is war not upon any proclamation This may be a question of great doubt Whenever the courts are powerless and the peaceable course of jus tice is stopped some claim it is to be deemed a time of war and the maxim Inter arma silent leges applies The declaration of martial law is only the formal acceptance and recognition of the existence of a state of war already begun It places under absolute military power all the inhabitants of the district and subjects them to military rule as if they were enemies in a public war By rising in rebellion the rebels forfeit all their constitutional rights and this applies to the entire population of the district which is in a state of rebellion Martial law then is nothing more nor less than a declaration of war by the sovereign against his subjects in consequence of a prior levying of war by them This is the fundamental principle All those in the district in a state of rebellion are outlaws and rebels whether actively employed in support of the rebellion or not Martial law if it can exist means the establishment of absolute discretion ary military authority such as in times of war is exercised against the enemy The military measures to be adopted are a matter of military discretion The summary infliction of flogging or death the burning of houses and other measures would all be legal though employed against prisoners or other persons not in actual resistence It is of the very essence of martial law that it involves a power of military punishment more speedy and terrible than the proceedings of ordinary law It is not limited to measures of necessity Since there is absolute discretionary authority to do anything which could possibly be termed necessary or expedient there can be no legal lia bility as regards those who give or obey military orders Martial law deals only with rebellion so formidable as to amount to war and to require measures of war It is an independent power of action when riot turns into rebellion too serious for military force acting merely in aid of the civil power Military government is what exists today in Belgium being exer cised by a foreign invader Martial law is the same thing at home exercised by the military over the citizen considered as an enemy 8 Finlason Treatise on Martial Law See also Tilonko v Atty Genl 1907 App Cases 93 Privy Council Io5MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW III MILITARY CRITICISMS ON COMMON LAW POWERS The suppression of actual insurrection the resistence of outward acts of rebellion may be effected without martial law as Lord MANSIFIELD showed on the occasion of the Lord George Gordon riots in I780 in which over 450 persons were killed or wounded by the military The common law provides ample powers for the re sistance of actual outrage even to the extent of inflicting death if necessary Any person whether soldier or citizen may lawfully re sist or disperse an unlawful or riotous assemblage Any one may put to death persons in the actual commission of felony the burning of houses etc if otherwise unable to restrain them FINLASON however contends that the common law powers of the military are inadequate for the following reasons The great difficulty at common law is to hit the precise line be tween justification and excessive force as justification depends upon proof of apparent necessity If it is possible to arrest those who are in open rebellion they must be arrested and tried at common law It is not lawful to kill them unless apparently necessary to prevent a present act of felony or overcome forcible resistance At common law it is not lawful to inflict death for the prevention of what is a mere trespass or misdemeanor Only under the riot act can deadly force be used for the dispersion of rioters since at com mon law riot is a mere misdemeanor The riot act does not author ize attacks or firing by the military upon bodies or mobs of people merely because they are unlawful and tumultuous when not felon ious Only after a riot has continued for an hour after proclama tion to disperse does it became felonious A summary power of arrest of those who incite riot and disorder is necessary The common law is based upon a theory of peace and the supremacy of law It is provided for ordinary times and cir cumstances and makes no adequate provision for times when the civil power is paralyzed Common law prosecutions and punishments are too dilatory to put down rebellion Martial law allows of summary procedure and military executions In a great public emergency public safety is the paramount object and individual security must give way On the other hand it may be suggested that a fierce and exasperated soldiery should not be made at once judge jury and executioner It is further contended by military lawyers that the military should have full discretion as to tactics and should not be limited to mere Io6QUALIFIED MARTIAL LAW necessity unless taken in the larger sense of expediency with refer ence to the suppression of the rebellion This should depend upon the judgment of the officer in command The guaranties in the federal constitution and the state consti tutions are peace provisions and become silent in time of war Law breakers have forfeited all of their rights to protection or consid eration as against the troops Leaders of insurrection when arrested must not be turned over to the civil authorities and perhaps admitted to bail to take their place again as leaders of the insurrection When called upon to save the community from the mob the mili tary should not act under the burden risk and restraint of having to make out a justification for their acts by legal evidence The ef ficiency of the military should not be impaired by court writs or orders The militia should not be required to jeopardize their free dom and their property in putting down mob violence They should not be called upon to prove in court the precise amount of force which appeared reasonably necessary to an officer in a given emergency when menaced by rioters Subordinates should not be permitted to question the lawfulness of military orders at a critical time Unlawful acts should be ex cusable by orders received from military superiors Finally it is contended the militia should be left solely to the control of military discipline under provisions similar to if not identical with the Articles of War and the United States Army Regulations You cannot combine civil responsibility and martial law it is claimed Therefore the thing to do is to legalize the cir cumstances under which martial law may be proclaimed by the Governor The whole subject of the relations of the civil and the military may be covered adequately by providing that troops when called out by the Governor shall be subject to the Articles of War and the Army Regulations of the United States Army so far as applicable with no jurisdiction in the ordinary courts and no reme dies allowed to citizens for abuse of power4 IV AMERICAN DECISIONS AND STATUTES ADOPTING EXTREME MILITARY VIEW A few states particularly West Virginia Idaho Colorado and Pennsylvania have gone to a surprising extent in recent years in supporting extreme doctrines of martial law The West Virginia 4But Art 59 of the Articles of War recognizes the prior jurisdiction of the ordinary courts except in time of war in criminal matters 1o7MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW court holds in effect that the Governor of the state may by procla mation of martial law confer upon himself and on his military rep resentatives a supreme and unlimited power over all his fellow citi zens within a described area which suspends the functions of the civil courts and magistrates and substitutes in their place the mere will of the military commander A military commission or summary court may be established as a substitute for the ordinary courts to try civilians for crime or disobedience of military orders and procla mations The military may disregard the writ of habeas corpus or other process of the courts if issued If the military take life or injure person or property they are immune from civil suit or crim inal prosecution even for unreasonable acts and the ordinary courts are without jurisdiction to review the legality of military measures The military may arrest without warrant merely on suspicion and may hold and detain prisoners so arrested for indefinite periods at their discretion without charge of crime and without turning them over to the civil courts for preliminary examination bail or for trial They may exercise a censorship of the press and suppress newspapers at their discretion They may prescribe to employers what classes of laborers they shall or shall not employ They may forcibly enter and search private houses and seize property therein without a search warrant They may issue peremptory orders and proclamations to the citizens generally having the force of law5 It is contended that martial law power even extends to the sum mary trial and punishment of offenses committed previous to the proclamation of martial law or at least to all offenses committed in connection with the insurrection Offenders may be arrested out of the proclaimed district and brought into it for trial even if they have never personally been there if their publications or acts have caused trouble or mischief there or if they have participated in conspiracy or incitement connected with the insurrection The con tinuance of martial law depends upon considerations of military exi gency of which the Governor is the judge Before considering the provisions of the proposed military code it may be well also to glance briefly at the existing legislation which deals with this subject from the extreme military standpoint 5 State v Brown 71 W Va 519 77 S E 243 and notes thereto in 45 L R A N S 996 and Ann Cas I914C i Ex parte Jones

I08QUALIFIED MARTIAL LAW In a number of states statutes prescribe the occasions upon which martial law or a state of insurrection and rebellion may be de clared by the Governor but there is no attempt at definition of what the legal consequences of such a declaration may be In many states there are also statutes asserting in the broadest terms that members of the militia shall not be liable civilly or criminally for acts done while in active service Thus by the laws of Illinois6 Should any member of the Na tional Guard or Naval Reserve of Illinois either an enlisted man or commissioned officer while in the discharge of his duty on active service in pursuance to orders from a superior authority take life or injure any person or persons or their property the acts shall be deemed justifiable and lawful and he shall not be prosecuted there for in any court or incur any civil liability by reason thereof It is also provided that a military officer shall exercise his dis cretion and be the sole judge as to what means are necessary for the work to be done or the results to be attained By Section 208 officers and military force shall be held guiltless of any crime and justified in law in killing and wounding any persons in their efforts at dispersing an unlawful or riotous assembly Not a word is said as to excessive force or abuse of discretion Military immunity alone is considered By the New York Military Law Sec I4 members of the Na tional Guard on active service shall not be liable civilly or crim inally for any acts done by them while on duty No officer or member of the militia while acting under orders from the com manderinchief shall be liable to any action civil or criminal in any court for any act committed within the scope of his orders on duty and in obedience thereto By a Louisiana statute7 there are similar provisions to the effect that militia men shall not be liable civilly or criminally for any act while on duty but shall be liable only to courtmartial The act was considered by the Louisiana court in OShee v Stafford8 and the court declared that the lawmaker could not exempt superior officers from civil responsibility for torts or deny to the citizen for injury done him adequate remedy by due process of law in plain contravention of the constitution9 6 Military and Naval Code Art XX Sec II 7 Stats 1914 p 371 8 122 La 444 47 So 764 i6 Ann Cas 1163 9 See also Johnson v Jones 44 Ill 142 og9MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW V THE CODE CHAP I POWERS AND STATUS OF THE MILITARY We shall now consider briefly the fundamental provisions of the proposed military code which attempts to make a proper adjust ment of the use of force to the safeguards of constitutional liberty We shall pass over the first five sections as selfexplanatory with the exception of Sec 2 which will be considered later Secs 6 and 7 deal with the occasions and authority for calling out the militia The Governor may by the constitutions of most states call out the militia to execute the laws to suppress insurrection and repel in vasion0 The Governor is the judge in determining when an exi gency has arisen for calling out the militia to preserve the peace of the state just as the President is the judge of when an emergency has arisen for calling out the federal troops If the military are called out the Governor or his military representative becomes su preme in command A subordinate military officer a judge mayor or sheriff are none of theim in the absence of statute authorized to call out the National Guard but provisions are made in several states that if there is not time or opportunity for communicating with the Governor the militia may be provisionally called out by some of these local authoritiesl The military is in all states except New York declared forever subordinate to the civil power As it is put in the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights Art XVII And the military power shall always be held in exact subordination to the civil power and be governed by it It has been supposed by some courts and writers that this means that the military can only act under the orders of the civil peace officers and in aid of sheriffs and other magistrates2 This would seem clearly to be an error The words used are civil power and not civil officers This provision does not say that the militia shall be put under the command of local peace officers The section is found in the various Bills of Rights and is put there to insure subordination to law so that under no pretense shall the civil law be subverted or displaced and the arbitrary rule of martial law be substituted therefor It is a declaration to the effect that martial law shall not be declared but that all citizens and soldiers alike shall be subject to the laws of the land and answerable to the 0 Stimson Federal and State Constitutions Sec 298 p 347  Chapin v Ferry 5 Wash 386 15 L R A ii6 Commonwealth v Shortall 206 Pa St 165 65 L R A 193 12 State v Coit 8 Ohio Dec 62 Ela v Smith 5 Gray 121 IIOQUALIFIED MARTIAL LAW courts The Governor is the chief conservator of the peace and the militia under his control is as subordinate to the civil power viz the law as if under control of the sheriff13 Sec 9 defines the general powers and status of the military and is perhaps the most fundamental section of the entire code as it covers a matter which hitherto has lacked definition Officers and soldiers at the English common law have no special privileges as to the use of force A soldier for the purpose of establishing civil order is only a citizen armed in a particular manner He cannot because he is a soldier excuse himself if without necessity he takes human life14 A very well considered Kentucky case has taken a step beyond this and has given the militia the status of peace officers In Franks v Smith15 it is declared as a matter of common law that the orders which a soldier on riot duty is justified in executing are confined to such as a peace officer may execute in the discharge of his duty The soldier has the same measure of protection and is subject to the same liability whether he is acting under orders of a military officer or is acting under the direction of the sheriff Under English common law a policeman or other peace officer must suffer the consequences of any illegal act or abuse of authority he may commit and cannot divest himself of responsibility by plead ing the orders of his superior officer The Continental theory on the other hand evolved from the necessities of autocratic government makes of the police force the strong arm of the ruling classes The policeman is liable only under special laws administered by special courts regulating the relations of public officials to private citizens Much more discretion is thus allowed for arrests searches third degree methods restrictions of public meeting and freedom of dis cussion and the English safeguards of personal liberty by which possible abuses of power may be curbed are lackingl6 13 See Code Sec 8 see also Vol io Opinions Atty Genl U S 79 Franks v Smith 142 Ky 232 I34 S W 484 Ann Cas I912D 319 L R A I915A 1141 Ex parte Mc Donald 49 Mont 454

or injury to a person results from the illegal exercise of military or naval authority the respon sible parties are liable to criminal and civil proceedings17 Under the English Army Act Sec I62 3 it is the duty of com manding officers to hand over officers or soldiers under their com mand who are accused of offenses to the civil power and refusal to do so or to assist the civil power in apprehending offenders is made a misdemeanor A soldier in that capacity incurs additional re sponsibility and becomes subject at all times to military law and discipline contained in the Army Act and to army regulations and orders but he does not escape civil liabilities At common law then according to the orthodox doctrine the mil itary is at most merely an extension of the police force of the state with the ordinary powers of peace officers except as these powers are extended by statute It is even doubtful at English common law whether the military are peace officers and they have often been stated to be merely private individuals As Lord MANSVIFLD said in his great speech in the House of Lords on the employment of the military to quell the Lord George Gordon riots of 1780 the persons who assisted in the suppression of these tumults were to be considered as mere private individuals acting as duty required Secs 9 and io provide for the conferring on the National Guard of certain further and additional powers beyond those which may be exercised by peace officers at common law The statute provides for a kind of qualified military law after a proclamation by the Governor declaring a given district to be in a state of insurrection This is very different from absolute martial law It allows of the use of military force only in aid of the civil power that is for the preserva tion of the laws and the constitution and for the apprehension dis persion and resistance of those in actual outrage Military power under our constitution as we have seen can only be used under in aid of and as part of the civil power that is according to law and within the limits defined by it Military experience and public opinion seem to demand that the National Guard have in extraordinaiy emergencies somewhat in creased powers and greater authority than ordinary peace officers The statute should however limit the scope of military discretion to prevent oppression and misguided interference with constitutional rights The effect of a declaration of a state of insurrection under this Code is not to confer undefined powers and immunities upon 17 IX Halsbury Laws of England 104 289 488 112QUALIFIED MARTIAL LAWF the military but merely to give such additional powers as are de fined by the Code Without such a declaration the military will have all of the powers of peace officers These will in many perhaps in most cases be sufficient Secs I I and 12 are designed to indicate the scope of the justifiable use of force against a mob The question whether on any occasion the moment has come to fire upon a mob of rioters depends upon the necessities of the case to prevent serious and violent crime We have seen the military criticism that at common law the use of armed force is limited to the resistance of felonious outrage and that be fore rioters may be fired upon they must be actually engaged in or about to attempt an act of felony not otherwise to be prevented since one cannot kill at common law to prevent a mere misde meanor18 Riot was only a misdemeanor at common law but by a statute of George I the Riot Act it was made a felony for twelve rioters to continue together one hour after a proclamation to disperse and peaceably depart Such proclamation was absurdly called Reading the Riot Act The magistrate might then safely order the troops to fire on the rioters and charge them sword in hand without further proof of necessity But this was not intended to require a proclama tion nor to restrict the authority to fire on a mob or to disperse them with the bayonet in case of necessity though such popular misconstruction arose Where a mob is shouting cursing hurling rocks and beating and maiming victims military officers as well as peaceable citizens or the sheriff or his posse may use such force as is necessary to make arrests and disperse the mob even to the extent of firing to kill9 By Sec 489 of the United States Army Regulations troops called into action against a mob are to apply military tactics and It is purely a tactical question in what manner they shall use the weapons with which they are armedwhether by fire of musketry and artil lery or by the use of bayonets and sabre or by both and at what stage of the operations each or either mode of attack shall be employ ed It is further provided But as soon as sufficient warning has been given to enable the innocent to separate themselves from the guilty the action of the troops should be governed solely by tactical con siderations involved in the duty they are ordered to perform Al though it is necessary to give the military great discretionary power it seems erroneous to lay it down broadly that it is purely a tactical 18 See I Russell on Crimes 7th ed 437 19 Stephen History of Criminal Law 21o I13MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW question in what manner and at what stage of the operations they shall attack the mob Under the proposed Code the military man is not bound to prove that he weighed with scrupulous nicety the pre cise amount of force apparently necessary to suppress the disorder as would be the case at common law The exercise of a reasonable and honest discretion is all that is required Giving due weight to the argument that those who are suddenly called upon to save the community from the mob should not be put upon trial and forced to justify themselves as best they may by strict legal evidence of the apparent necessity of the degree of force used it would seem that sufficient protection is given when the prose cution is required to offer evidence that the act in question could not have been done in good faith or in the honest exercise of discre tion or that the acts complained of were reckless oppressive wanton or malicious While the law should allow wide discretion it must remain supreme and enforce some sense of responsibility that military force and authority shall be exercised with humanity and justice as well as firmness Verbal abuse by a mob does not of itself justify a military officer in using severe measures of repression although it may well justify arrest to prevent working the mob to overt acts As Sir FREDERICK POLLOCK has pointed out juries are not likely to take an unduly narrow view of what a man may reason ably or honestly do in the public interest in time of emergency20 It seems fair in meritorious cases that the expenses of litigation in curred by the servants of the state on account of the discharge of their duties should be borne by the state As an example of unj ustifiable force threatened against leaders of a mob the following incident which occurred at Ludlow Colorado on November 13 1914 may be related This occurred under the command of one of the best officers of the Guard A detail of ten men and a sergeant were sent to cover the Ludlow station at train time to protect strikebreakers A crowd of strikers men and women armed with clubs came to the depot The detail was ordered to fix bayonets and with much grumbling and muttering the depot and grounds were cleared But the mob refused to move further than the road and opposed to the ten sentries was a solid mass of strikers with the clubswinging women in the front rank giving vent to abuse and a sullen crowd of men in the rear urging the women to violence If trouble had started nothing could have pre vented some women being bayoneted and others shot Three lead ers of the strikers Bernardo Weinberger and Jones who were at 20 F Pollock What is Martial Law i8 Law Quart Rev 152 114A STATE MILITARY CODE large in

IN THEIR RELATIONS WITH CIVILIANS AN ACT to define the powers and duties of the National Guard when called out to execute the laws or suppress riot and insurrection and of the Federal troops when called upon to protect a state against domestic violence CHAPTER I POWERS AND DUTIES Sec i National Guard The organized militia shall be designated the National Guard of  and their powers and duties shall be as pro vided in this act which shall be known as the Military Code Sec 2 Federal Troops When the land and naval forces of the United States or the organized militia of this or other states shall have been called forth by the President of the United States into active service on applica tion of the state to protect the state against domestic violence or insurrec tion they shall be subject to this act and have the powers and duties hereby given Sec 3 Commanding Officer The Governor shall be Commanderin Chief of the National Guard except when called into the service of the United States and he shall appoint an Adjutant General whose term of office shall commence upon the first day after the inauguration of the Gov ernor and shall continue for two years or until his successor is duly ap pointed and qualified The Governor shall have power to remove the Adju tant General for cause Sec 4 Organization The organization armament and discipline of the National Guard shall be the same as those which are now or may hereafter I5MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW be prescribed for the organized militia of the States by the War Depart ment of the United States The Adjutant General and all field officers shall be appointed by the Governor from members of the National Guard who shall have served as commissioned officers for at least one year on the active list in the National Guard or in the Army of the United States The word officer as used herein shall designate commissioned officer the word soldier shall include noncommissioned officers privates and other enlisted men Sec 5 Military Regulations The State Military Board shall consist of the Governor the Adjutant General the Judge Advocate and two line offi cers on the active list present for duty to be designated by the Governor The junior officer shall be recorder of the Board The Board shall from time to time prescribe such military regulations not inconsistent with law as will increase the discipline and efficiency of the National Guard Such regulations shall conform to those prescribed for the Army of the United States so far as applicable to state conditions The regulations prescribed by the Military Board when

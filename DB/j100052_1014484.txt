J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1014484,RECLAMATION OF SWAMP LANDS AND THE MODERN DRAINAGE BOND,I242677,RECLAMATION OF SWAMP LANDS AND THE MODERN DRAINAGE BOND BY J SHEPPARD SMITH VICEPRESIDENT MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TRUST COMPANY ST LOUIS CHAIRMAN RECLAMATION SECURITIES COMMITTEE INVESTMENT BANKERS ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA 19131919 AMOUNT OF SWAMP LAND TO BE RECLAIMED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR COUNTRY IT WAS ONLY NATURAL THAT THE FARM LANDS WHICH WERE MORE READILY SUS CEPTIBLE TO CULTIVATION SHOULD HAVE BEEN OCCUPIED FIRST AND THAT THE OVER FLOWED AND SWAMP LANDS SHOULD HAVE BEEN OVERLOOKED ENTIRELY FOR YEARS IT WAS ONLY AFTER THE ABSORPTION OF THE MORE DESIRABLE FARMING LAND WHICH RESULTED FROM THE INCREASE OF POPULA TION AND AFTER THE CONSEQUENT AND MORE INTENSIVE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTRY THAT ATTENTION WAS DIRECTED TO THE RECLAIMING OF THE OVERFLOWED LANDS AND THAT HUMAN INGENUITY MADE IT POSSIBLE TO BRING SUCH LAND UNDER CULTIVATION THESE SWAMP AND OVER FLOWED LANDS AWAITING RECLAMATION IT IS ESTIMATED TOTAL 125000 SQUARE MILES WHICH IS MORE THAN TWO ANDONEHALF TIMES THE AREA OF THE ENTIRE STATE OF ILLINOIS AND IF RECLAIMED WOULD AFFORD HOMES FOR 12500000 PERSONS AT A VALUATION OF 100 PER ACRE8000000 000 WOULD BE ADDED TO THE WEALTH OF THE NATION ATTITUDE OF THE GOVERNMENT TOWARD RECLAMATION WHILE THE VAST OPPORTUNITIES AFFORDED IN THIS DIRECTION ARE NOT ALTOGETHER GENERALLY APPRECIATED THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT IN RECENT YEARS HAS RECOGNIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SUB JECT AND HAS PROVIDED THROUGH THE UNITED STATES RECLAMATION BRANCH OF THE AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT A MEANS OF SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF THE QUESTION THIS DEPARTMENT UNDER THE MANAGE MENT OF INTELLIGENT AND EFFICIENT EXPERTS HAS MADE PROGRESS BOTH IN THE EDUCA TION OF THE PEOPLE AT LARGE AND IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE MEANS BY WHICH THIS ACREAGE COULD BE MORE READILY RECLAIMED THE NATIONAL DRAINAGE CONGRESS WHOSE MEMBERSHIP EMBRACES SOME OF THE BEST AUTHORITIES ON THE SUBJECT HAS THROUGH THE EARNEST AND EFFICIENT WORK OF ITS OFFICERS AND MEM BERS AND BY THE INFLUENCE OF ITS ANNUAL CONVENTIONS ATTRACTED NATIONAL ATTENTION AND CONTRIBUTED GREATLY TO THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE WORK DISTRIBUTION OF THE SWAMP LANDS IN THE UNITED STATES WHILE THESE UNRECLAIMED LANDS ARE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT PRACTICALLY EVERY STATE OF THE UNION THERE IS A PARTICU LARLY LARGE ACREAGE IN THOSE STATES TRIBUTARY TO AND DRAINED BY THE MISS ISSIPPI RIVER KNOWN AS THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY THE AREA OF WHICH IS 1240050 SQUARE MILES A LITTLE LESS THAN 50 PER CENT OF THE ENTIRE AREA OF THE UNITED STATES AND IN EXCESS OF THE TOTAL AREA OF ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THE EUROPEAN 10IMODERN DRAINAGE BONDS 103 BELLIGERENTS EXCEPTING RUSSIA OF THE 27800 MILES OF NAVIGABLE WATERWAYS IN THE UNITED STATES THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY SYSTEM CONTAINS 15000 MILES IN THE STATES EMBRACED IN THIS VALLEY THERE ARE YET MILLIONS OF ACRES AWAITING DEVELOPMENT IN THE STATE OF LOUISI ANA ALONE THERE ARE SAID TO BE 10196 605 ACRES OF SWAMP OR MARSH LANDS WHICH SHOULD BE DRAINED EITHER WHOLLY OR IN PART IN ARKANSAS 5912300 ACRES IN MISSISSIPPI 5760200 ACRES IN MISSOURI 2439600 ACRES AND IN ALABAMA 1479200 ACRES SUCH LANDS WITH THEIR RICH ALLUVIAL SOIL ARE WHEN RECLAIMED EXCEPTIONALLY FERTILE AND POSSESS EVEN GREATER AGRICULTURAL POSSI BILITIES THAN THOSE MORE FORTUNATELY SITUATED BY NATURE THESE LANDS ARE EITHER SWAMP OR MARSH SWAMP LANDS ARE THOSE WHICH ARE UNDER WATER AT ONLY CERTAIN SEASONS OF THE YEAR AND ARE SUFFICIENTLY FREE FROM OVERFLOW AT OTHER PERIODS TO GIVE THE FOREST TREES A CHANCE TO GROW AND DEVELOP MARSH LANDS ARE THOSE WHICH ARE UNDER WATER ALMOST THE ENTIRE SEASON AND THERE FORE HAVE NO GROWTH UPON THEM EXCEPT GRASSES AND WATER PLANTS DRAINAGE PROBLEMS DRAINAGE PROBLEMS MAY BE DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES NAMELY GRAVITY AND PUMPING GRAVITY PROJECTS ARE THOSE WHERE THE DRAINAGE MAY BE ACCOM PLISHED BY A NATURAL FLOW OF THE WATER INTO MAIN AND LATERAL DITCHES PROVIDED FOR ITS OUTLET PUMPING PROJECTS ARE THOSE WHERE IT IS NECESSARY ON ACCOUNT OF THE DISTRICT BEING BELOW THE WATER LEVEL TO REMOVE THE WATER BY MEANS OF PUMPING THE LATTER ARE BY FAR THE MOST DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE PROBLEMS BOTH IN THEIR ORIGINAL CONSTRUCTION AND SUBSEQUENT MAINTENANCE AND OPERATION EARLY ATTEMPTS AT DRAINAGE THE FIRST ATTEMPTS AT DRAINAGE WERE ENTIRELY BY INDIVIDUAL EFFORTS AND THESE FOR MANIFEST REASONS LARGELY PROVED UNSATISFACTORY AND WERE FOLLOWED BY A COOIPERATIVE EFFORT ON THE PART OF VARI OUS LAND HOLDERS WHOSE PROPERTIES WERE CONTIGUOUS TO EACH OTHER NECESSARILY THE PROGRESS IN ITS EARLY STAGES WAS SLOW AND MANY DIFFICULTIES WERE ENCOUNTERED TO BEGIN WITH IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR THE INTERESTED PARTIES TO UNITE ON A PLAN THAT WOULD BE SATISFACTORY TO ALL CON CERNED AND AT THE SAME TIME SECURE THE OUTLET FOR THE DRAINAGE WHERE IT WAS NECESSARY TO CARRY THE DITCHES ACROSS THE LANDS OF THOSE WHO WERE NOT BENE FITED BY THE PROJECT AS WELL AS TO AGREE ON THE PERSONNEL OF THE ORGANIZATION UNDER WHOSE AUSPICES THE WORK WAS TO BE CONDUCTED DIFFICULTIES TOO PRE SENTED THEMSELVES IN ADJUSTING THE BENEFITS OR DAMAGES THAT WOULD ACCRUE TO THE LANDOWNERS THEREIN WHILE THESE EFFORTS IN THE MAJORITY OF INSTANCES WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL THEY WERE THE MEANS THROUGH WHICH THE ATTENTION OF THE VARIOUS STATES WAS ATTRACTED TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SUBJECT ORGANIZATION OF MODERN DRAINAGE DISTRICTS IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT IF ANYTHING WAS TO BE ACCOMPLISHED ON A COMPRE HENSIVE BASIS IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO FORM DRAINAGE DISTRICTS INTO POLITICAL SUB DIVISIONS OR AT LEAST INTO PUBLIC CORPORATIONS WITH PROPER POWER UNDER THE LAW TO FORM THE NECESSARY ORGANIZA TIONS WITH WHICH TO CONDUCT THE WORK ON AN INTELLIGENT BASIS AND TO SUBJECT THE LAND CONTAINED THEREIN TO AN EQUI TABLE TAX IN PROPORTION TO THE BENEFITS RECEIVED AS DETERMINED BY AN AUTHORI TATIVE SOURCE TO ASSESS THE BENEFITS104 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY THEREIN AND DETERMINE THE DAMAGES ON SURROUNDING TERRITORY PROPER MEASURES WERE ENACTED BY THE VARIOUS LEGISLATIVE BODIES WHICH HAVE RESULTED IN THE CREATION OF THE MODERN DRAINAGE DIS TRICT AS A MUNICIPAL CORPORATION CAPA BLE OF ISSUING TAX SECURED BONDS THESE LAWS DIFFER IN SOME OF THEIR ESSENTIAL FEATURES IN THE VARIOUS STATES AND IN QUITE A NUMBER OF STATES SEVERAL DIFFERENT DRAINAGE ACTS EXIST NEARLY EVERY STATE AT THIS TIME POSSESSES SATISFACTORY DRAINAGE LAWS IT IS TO BE REGRETTED THAT NO SYSTEMATIC RECORD HAS BEEN KEPT BY THE VARIOUS STATES AS TO THE AMOUNT OF BONDS ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING NOR AS TO THE NUMBER OF ACRES OF LAND RECLAIMED AS A CONSE QUENCE NO ACCURATE DATA CAN BE GIVEN ON THE SUBJECT IN 1916 THE RECLAMA TION SECURITIES COMMITTEE OF THE INVESTMENT BANKERS ASSOCIATION MADE A DETERMINED EFFORT TO COLLECT SUCH STATISTICS BUT FOUND THAT IN VIEW OF THE ABOVE FACTS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT THE CIRCUIT COURT DRAINAGE ACT OF MISSOURI AS A CONCRETE CASE IT MAY BE DESIR ABLE TO OUTLINE THE SALIENT FEATURES OF THE PRINCIPAL DRAINAGE ACT IN MISSOURI THIS STATE POSSESSES A DRAINAGE LAW AS GOOD AS IF NOT BETTER THAN ANY OF THE OTHER STATES IN FACT

THE CIR CUIT COURT DRAINAGE ACT PASSED IN 1913 THIS PROVIDES THAT THE OWNERS OF A MAJORITY OF THE ACREAGE IN ANY CONTIGUOUS BODY OF SWAMP OR OVER FLOWED LAND SITUATED IN ONE OR MORE COUNTIES IN THE

TO THE INVESTOR FOR THE FULL PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TENOR OF THE BONDS DRAINAGE LAWS OF MISSOURI AND ARKANSAS COMPARED WHILE AS STATED NEARLY EVERY STATE POSSESSES SATISFACTORY DRAINAGE LAWS IT MIGHT BE OF INTEREST MERELY AS A MATTER OF COMPARISON TO MENTION THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE LAWS OF MIS SOURI AND ARKANSASTWO ADJOINING STATES WHOSE LAWS WHILE BOTH

ARKANSAS THE TAX LEVY MAY BE PAID BY ANYONE SO DESIRING WITHIN THIRTY DAYS AFTER THE LEVY OTHERWISE IT IS PAYABLE IN ANNUAL INSTALLMENTS BUT NO INSTALLMENT CAN BE FOR MORE THAN 25 PER CENT OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT IN ARKANSAS THE TAX IS A LIEN PREFERRED TO DEMANDS EXECUTIONS ENCUMBRANCES OR LIENS WHATSOEVER CREATED IN MISSOURI THE TAX IS A LIEN INFERIOR ONLY TO GENERAL STATE COUNTY SCHOOL AND ROAD TAXES PROCEEDINGS FOR FAILURE TO PAY TAX IN MISSOURI THE LAND IS SOLD IN THE MANNER PROVIDED FOR ENFORCEMENT OF DELINQUENT TAXES IN ARKANSAS THE TAX COLLECTOR REPORTS DELINQUENT TAXES TO THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS THEY THEN ADD 25 PER CENT TO THE AMOUNT AND BRING AN ACTION IN THE CHANCERY COURT FOR JURISDICTION IF THIS IS NOT DONE WITHIN SIXTY DAYS ANY BONDHOLDER MAY BRING SUCH ACTION AN ERROR IN

ALLOWED TO HAVE THE BENEFITS ASSESSED AGAINST HIS LAND TO BE REDUCED IN THE AMOUNT OF THE DAMAGES THE ORIGINAL BENEFITS RE MAIN UNCHANGED AND THE LAND REMAINS LIABLE TO TAXATION UP TO THE AMOUNT OF SUCH ORIGINAL BENEFITS ANY DAMAGES ALLOWED BY REASON OF SUCH CHANGE ARE INFERIOR TO THE CLAIMS OF BONDHOLDERS IN MISSOURI UPON PETITION OF 925 PER CENT OF THE OWNERS STATING THAT THERE HAS BEEN A MATERIAL CHANGE OF VALUES RENDERING THE ASSESSMENT OF BENEFITS INEQUITABLE THE COURT IF IT FINDS THIS TO BE TRUE APPOINTS THREE COMMIS SIONERS WHO REASSESS THE BENEFITS AND THROUGH SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME PRO CEEDINGS AS IN THE ORIGINAL ASSESSMENTS THE BENEFITS MAY BE MODIFIED AND READJUSTED AS IS EQUITABLE IT MAY BE ADDED THAT IN NEITHER STATE CAN ANY CHANGE BE MADE IN SUCH A WAY AS TO JEOPARDIZE THE OBLIGATION OR THE SECUR ITY OF ANY BONDS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN ISSUED FOR MANY YEARS ALL DRAINAGE STATUTES WERE MOST STRICTLY CONSTRUED IT BEING THE THEN CURRENT THEORY THAT GOVERN MENTS COULD NOT LEVY TAXES MERELY TO IMPROVE LANDS PRIVATELY OWNED BUT ONLY TO FURTHER SOME DISTINCTLY PUBLIC PURPOSE OR IN THE EXERCISE OF THE POLICE POWER TO PREVENT DISEASE REMOVE NUISANCES OR CONSERVE THE PUBLIC HEALTH IN SOME STATES THE STATUTES STILL REQUIRE BEFORE A DRAINAGE OR RECLAMATION PROJECT CAN BE INITIATED THAT THERE MUST BE A COURT FINDING THAT THE PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT WILL BE A PUBLIC UTILITY OR THAT IT WILL PROMOTE THE PUBLIC HEALTH OR PREVENT DISEASE IN THE COURSE OF TIME HOWEVER A MORE LIBERAL VIEW WAS OBTAINED AND WITH A CHANGING AND NOW SYMPATHETIC ATTITUDE ON THE PART OF THE OWNERS OF LANDS WHICH ARE TO BE AFFECTED AND TAXED FOR THE IMPROVEMENTS MANY OF THESE SWAMPS AND MARSHES HAVE BEEN REDEEMED AND THE WAY IS AT LAST OPEN FOR THE RECLAMA TION OF PERHAPS ALL THE REMAINDER OF SUCH LANDS SUCCESSFUL DRAINAGE PROJECTS WHILE MANY LARGE AND SUCCESSFUL DRAINAGE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN IN RECENT YEARS BY FAR THE LARGEST AND MOST PRETENTIOUS UNDERTAKING HAS BEEN THAT OF THE LITTLE RIVER DRAINAGE110 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY DISTRICT LOCATED IN SOUTHEAST MISSOURI IT MIGHT BE WELL TO GIVE A BRIEF HISTORY OF THIS DISTRICT AS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED IN PRACTICAL DRAINAGE LITTLE RIVER DRAINAGE DISTRICT IN MISSOURI THE ACREAGE OF THE LITTLE RIVER DRAINAGE DISTRICT LIES PARTLY IN EACH OF THE FOLLOWING SIX COUNTIES CAPE GIRARDEAU STODDARD DUNKLIN SCOTT NEW MADRID AND PEMISCOT THERE ARE 488050 ACRES OF LAND WITHIN ITS BOUNDARY LINES EMBRACING TERRITORY APPROXIMATELY 90 MILES LONG WITH AN AVERAGE WIDTH OF 10 MILES THERE ARE 160 MILES OF RAILROADS WITHIN THE DIS TRICT NOT AN ACRE OF LAND IS MORE THAN SIX AND ONEHALF MILES FROM THE RAIL ROAD THE AVERAGE DISTANCE BEING THREE AND ONEHALF MILES THE LAND HAD BEEN SUBJECT TO OVERFLOW FROM THE LITTLE RIVER AND THE CASTOR RIVER THE WATERS OF THESE RIVERS FLOWING INTO THE DISTRICT FROM THE NORTH THIS DISTRICT WAS ORGANIZED IN 1907 PRIOR TO THAT TIME SEVERAL SMALL DRAINAGE DISTRICTS EXISTED IN LANDS THAT ARE LOCATED EITHER WHOLLY OR IN PART IN THE TERRITORY NOW EMBRACED IN THE ABOVE DISTRICT IT BECAME EVIDENT AT THAT TIME TO SOME OF THE LARGER OWNERS OF LAND IN THAT SECTION THAT IF THIS VAST ACREAGE WAS TO BE RECLAIMED AS A WHOLE A LARGER AND MORE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN WOULD HAVE TO BE CARRIED OUT AND ONE THAT WOULD PROVIDE NOT ONLY FOR THE DRAINAGE OF THE LAND BUT ALSO FOR THE CONTROL AND DIVERSION OF THE WATERS FROM THE LITTLE AND CASTOR RIVERS IN ORDER TO PRO VIDE FULL RELIEF IT WAS NECESSARY TO CREATE A DIVERSION CHANNEL AND RETAIN ING BASINS WHICH WOULD TURN THE FLOW OF THESE WATERS INTO THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER AT THE HEAD OF THE DISTRICT THUS PREVENTING THEIR OVERFLOWING THE DIS TRICT AT CERTAIN PERIODS OF THE YEAR WHICH HAD PREVIOUSLY OCCURRED AFTER PROPER PETITIONS HAD BEEN RECEIVED FROM A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF THE LAND OWNERS IN THIS TERRITORY THE LITTLE RIVER DRAINAGE DISTRICT WAS CREATED IN NOVEMBER 1907 BONDS TO THE AMOUNT OF 5000000 BEARING 51 PER CENT INTEREST WERE ISSUED DATED APRIL 1 1913 AND MATURING SERIALLY IN ANNUAL INSTALLMENTS BEGINNING APRIL 1 1919 UP TO AND INCLUDING APRIL 1 1933 NECESSARILY WHERE SUCH A LARGE ACREAGE WAS INVOLVED AND WHERE PORTIONS OF PREVIOUS DRAINAGE DISTRICTS WERE TO BE MERGED INTO THIS ONE MANY LEGAL OBSTACLES PRESENTED THEMSELVES AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL 1913 THAT THESE WERE FINALLY ADJUDICATED BY A DECISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI IN FAVOR OF THE DISTRICT WHILE THIS DECISION PERFECTED IN EVERY RESPECT THE LEGALITY OF THE BONDS NEVERTHELESS THE ISSUE WAS FURTHER SUPPORTED BY THE APPROVING OPINION OF SEVERAL OF THE ABLEST MUNICIPALBOND LAWYERS IN THE COUNTRY AN ABLE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN CREATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW WITH HEADQUARTERS AT CAPE GIRARDEAU MISSOURI WHICH IS LOCATED ABOUT THREE MILES NORTH OF THE NORTHERN BOUNDARY OF THE DISTRICT THIS ISSUE WAS DIS POSED OF IN 1914 AND THE WORK ON THE DISTRICT WAS THEN UNDERTAKEN ON ACCOUNT OF THE UNUSUAL SIZE OF THE DISTRICT IT HAD UNUSUAL PROBLEMS TO MEET GREAT CARE WAS EXERCISED BY THE BOARD IN ITS SELECTION OF ENGINEERS AND BESIDES HAVING ITS OWN CHIEF ENGINEER IT HAD THE APPROVING OPINION UPON THE DRAINAGE PLAN INAUGURATEDMODERN DRAINAGE BONDS 111 OF FIVE OF THE LEADING HYDRAULIC ENGI NEERS OF THE COUNTRY AT THE TIME WHEN THIS PROJECT WAS FIRST UNDERTAKEN APPROXIMATELY 90 PER CENT OF THE LAND WAS NOT SUBJECT TO CULTIVATION TODAY ABOUT 75 PER CENT OF THE LAND CAN BE CULTIVATED AND WITHIN FOUR MONTHS IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE WORK WILL BE FULLY COMPLETED AND ALL THE LAND WILL BE OPEN FOR CULTIVATION IT WAS FOUND IN 1918 THAT DUE TO THE INCREASED COST OF OPERATION AND ADDITIONAL WORK FOUND NECESSARY THE PROCEEDS OF THE 5000000 BOND ISSUE WOULD NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO COMPLETE THE WORK UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE LAW AN ADDITIONAL 1000000 OF BONDS WERE ISSUED AND PROMPTLY DIS POSED OF IT IS ESTIMATED THAT BEFORE THE WORK IS FINALLY COMPLETED ANOTHER ISSUE OF AT LEAST ONEHALF MILLION DOLLARS OF BONDS WILL BE NECESSARY THESE BONDS IT IS EXPECTED WILL BE ISSUED IN THE EARLY PART OF 1920 AND IT IS THE FIRM BELIEF THAT THE WORK UPON THE DISTRICT WILL BE FINALLY COMPLETED AND THE DRAINAGE PLAN PERFECTED AT LEAST BY JULY 1 1920 WHEN THIS WORK IS COMPLETED THE LAND WHICH WAS ALMOST WHOLLY A DISMAL SWAMP WILL BECOME A VERY FERTILE AND RICH FARMING TERRITORY IN 1907 THE AVERAGE VALUE OF THE LANDS IN THE DISTRICT WAS 10 TO 15 PER ACRE TODAY THE LAND WILL EASILY AVERAGE 75 PER ACRE WHILE THE TOTAL BONDED DEBT WILL UPON COMPLETION BE APPROXIMATELY 1450 PER ACRE IT WILL BE SEEN FROM THIS THAT TAKING THE HIGHEST AVERAGE OF THE LAND IN 1907 NAMELY 15 PER ACREAND ADDING THE BONDED DEBT OF 1450 PER ACRE THE LAND HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED IN VALUE IT MIGHT BE WELL TO MENTION THAT IN SOME INSTANCES LAND ESPECIALLY WELL LOCATED IN THIS TERRITORY HAS SOLD AS HIGH AS 225 PER ACRE SINCE THE DRAINAGE PLAN WAS INAUGURATED AS A FURTHER EVIDENCE OF THE IMPROVEMENT IN THAT SECTION AS A RESULT OF THIS DRAINAGE PROJECT THE LITTLE TOWN OF BRAGG CITY MISSOURI HAVING A POPULATION OF SOME FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE WITH MODERN BUILDINGS AND PAVED STREETS IS IN EXISTENCE UPON A SITE THAT WAS NOTHING BUT A SWAMP IN 1914 IN DIVERTING THE WATERS FROM THE CASTOR AND LITTLE RIVERS TO THE MISSIS SIPPI RIVER GREAT CARE HAD TO BE EXER CISED IN THE ENGINEERING FEATURES PARTICULARLY REGARDING THE DIVERSION CHANNEL AND THE RETAINING BASINS A SPILLWAY WAS CONSTRUCTED IN ORDER TO GIVE RELIEF SHOULD THE IMPOUNDING OF THESE WATERS CREATE A GREATER PRESSURE THAN THE BASINS COULD WITHSTAND UNLESS SUCH RELIEF HAD BEEN PROVIDED THE CONSTRUCTION MIGHT HAVE GIVEN WAY AND DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES TO THE DISTRICT WOULD HAVE ENSUED UNDER EXTREME CONDITIONS THE SPILLWAY PROVIDES FOR A PARTIAL OVERFLOW OF THE WATER INTO THE DISTRICT WHICH THOUGH IT MIGHT RESULT IN SOME PARTIAL DAMAGE TO THE CROPS WOULD BE FAR BETTER THAN THE GREATER DAMAGE THAT WOULD BE SUSTAINED BY BOTH LIFE AND PROPERTY IN THE EVENT OF A SERIOUS BREAK IN ANY PORTION OF THE LEVEE WHICH MIGHT RESULT FROM TOO GREAT PRESSURE IT IS NOT ANTICIPATED THAT ANY SUCH OCCUR RENCE WILL TRANSPIRE BUT IT WAS THOUGHT ESSENTIAL TO PROVIDE FOR SUCH A CONTIN GENCY SHOULD IT ARISE THE PAYMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST OF ANY MUNICIPAL BOND ACCORD ING TO ITS TENOR IS NECESSARILY DEPENDENT UPON PROMPT COLLECTION OF THE TAXES IT MIGHT BE INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT SINCE ITS INCEPTION THIS DISTRICT HAS119 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY COLLECTED EACH YEAR APPROXIMATELY 98 PER CENT OF THE DRAINAGE TAX ASSESSED AGAINST IT WHICH WILL UNQUESTIONABLY COMPARE FAVORABLY WITH THAT OF ANY MUNICIPALITY IN THE UNITED STATES EITHER LARGE OR SMALL MARKET FOR DRAINAGE BONDS WHILE FIFTEEN YEARS AGO DRAINAGE BONDS HAD A COMPARATIVELY NARROW MARKET WHICH WAS TO SOME EXTENT LIMITED TO THOSE STATES LOCATED IN THE MIDDLE WEST WHERE THE DRAINAGE PROB LEM WAS BETTER UNDERSTOOD THEY HAVE GRADUALLY INCREASED IN POPULARITY AND TODAY ENJOY A VERY SUBSTANTIAL POSITION IN THE EYES OF INVESTORS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY THIS HAS BEEN DUE TO A BETTER AND MORE GENERAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE SUBJECT AND TO THE RECORD THESE ISSUES HAVE MADE IN THE PAYMENT OF THEIR PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST MANY EASTERN BOND HOUSES WHICH UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO WOULD NOT CON SIDER HANDLING DRAINAGE BONDS ARE TODAY EAGERLY BUYING LARGE ISSUES THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE MISSISSIPPI VAL LEY THE FACT THAT SUCH ISSUES BEAR A HIGHER RETURN ON THE INVESTMENT THAN THE GENERAL OBLIGATIONS OF COUNTIES AND CITIES AND POSSESS THE SAME TAX EXEMPTION FEATURES HAS MADE THEM ESPECIALLY POPULAR THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT DRAINAGE BONDS ISSUED UNDER PROPER AUSPICES CONSTITUTE A SAFE INVESTMENT GREAT CARE MUST BE EXER CISED HOWEVER UPON THE PART OF THE INVESTMENT HOUSES HANDLING SUCH ISSUES A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE LAND MUST FIRST BE MADE AND IT MUST BE DETER MINED BEYOND ANY REASONABLE DOUBT THAT THE WORK TO BE UNDERTAKEN WILL RESULT IN AN ENHANCEMENT OF THE VALUE OF THE LAND TO A GREATER DEGREE THAN THE COST OF THE IMPROVEMENT IT IS IMPOR TANT THAT AT LEAST A MAJORITY OF THE LANDOWNERS IN THE DISTRICT BE IN FAVOR OF THE PROJECT AS A NUMBER OF DISSATIS FIED

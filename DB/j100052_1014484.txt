Bond By J SHEPPARD SMITH VicePresident Mississippi Valley Trust Company St Louis Chairman Reclamation Securities Committee Investment Bankers Association of America 19131919 AMOUNT OF SWAMP LAND TO BE RECLAIMED IN the development of our country it was only natural that the farm lands which were more readily sus ceptible to cultivation should have been occupied first and that the over flowed and swamp lands should have been overlooked entirely for years It was only after the absorption of the more desirable farming land which resulted from the increase of popula tion and after the consequent and more intensive development of the country that attention was directed to the reclaiming of the overflowed lands and that human ingenuity made it possible to bring such land under cultivation These swamp and over flowed lands awaiting reclamation it is estimated total 125000 square miles which is more than two andonehalf times the area of the entire state of Illinois and if reclaimed would afford homes for 12500000 persons At a valuation of 100 per acre8000000 000 would be added to the wealth of the nation ATTITUDE OF THE GOVERNMENT TOWARD RECLAMATION While the vast opportunities afforded in this direction are not altogether generally appreciated the United States government in recent years has recognized the importance of the sub ject and has provided through the United States Reclamation Branch of the Agricultural Department a means of scientific study of the question This department under the manage ment of intelligent and efficient experts has made progress both in the educa tion of the people at large and in the improvement of the means by which this acreage could be more readily reclaimed The National Drainage Congress whose membership embraces some of the best authorities on the subject has through the earnest and efficient work of its officers and mem bers and by the influence of its annual conventions attracted national attention and contributed greatly to the further development of the work DISTRIBUTION OF THE SWAMP LANDS IN THE UNITED STATES While these unreclaimed lands are scattered throughout practically every state of the Union there is a particu larly large acreage in those states tributary to and drained by the Miss issippi River known as the Mississippi Valley the area of which is 1240050 square miles a little less than 50 per cent of the entire area of the United States and in excess of the total area of all the countries of the European 10IMODERN DRAINAGE BONDS 103 belligerents excepting Russia Of the 27800 miles of navigable waterways in the United States the Mississippi Valley system contains 15000 miles In the states embraced in this valley there are yet millions of acres awaiting development In the state of Louisi ana alone there are said to be 10196 605 acres of swamp or marsh lands which should be drained either wholly or in part in Arkansas 5912300 acres in Mississippi 5760200 acres in Missouri 2439600 acres and in Alabama 1479200 acres Such lands with their rich alluvial soil are when reclaimed exceptionally fertile and possess even greater agricultural possi bilities than those more fortunately situated by nature These lands are either swamp or marsh Swamp lands are those which are under water at only certain seasons of the year and are sufficiently free from overflow at other periods to give the forest trees a chance to grow and develop Marsh lands are those which are under water almost the entire season and there fore have no growth upon them except grasses and water plants DRAINAGE PROBLEMS Drainage problems may be divided into two classes namely gravity and pumping Gravity projects are those where the drainage may be accom plished by a natural flow of the water into main and lateral ditches provided for its outlet Pumping projects are those where it is necessary on account of the district being below the water level to remove the water by means of pumping The latter are by far the most difficult and expensive problems both in their original construction and subsequent maintenance and operation EARLY ATTEMPTS AT DRAINAGE The first attempts at drainage were entirely by individual efforts and these for manifest reasons largely proved unsatisfactory and were followed by a cooiperative effort on the part of vari ous land holders whose properties were contiguous to each other Necessarily the progress in its early stages was slow and many difficulties were encountered To begin with it was difficult for the interested parties to unite on a plan that would be satisfactory to all con cerned and at the same time secure the outlet for the drainage where it was necessary to carry the ditches across the lands of those who were not bene fited by the project as well as to agree on the personnel of the organization under whose auspices the work was to be conducted Difficulties too pre sented themselves in adjusting the benefits or damages that would accrue to the landowners therein While these efforts in the majority of instances were not successful they were the means through which the attention of the various states was attracted to the importance of the subject ORGANIZATION OF MODERN DRAINAGE DISTRICTS It became evident that if anything was to be accomplished on a compre hensive basis it would be necessary to form drainage districts into political sub divisions or at least into public corporations with proper power under the law to form the necessary organiza tions with which to conduct the work on an intelligent basis and to subject the land contained therein to an equi table tax in proportion to the benefits received as determined by an authori tative source To assess the benefits104 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY therein and determine the damages on surrounding territory proper measures were enacted by the various legislative bodies which have resulted in the creation of the modern drainage dis trict as a municipal corporation capa ble of issuing tax secured bonds These laws differ in some of their essential features in the various states and in quite a number of states several different drainage acts exist Nearly every state at this time possesses satisfactory drainage laws It is to be regretted that no systematic record has been kept by the various states as to the amount of bonds issued and outstanding nor as to the number of acres of land reclaimed As a conse quence no accurate data can be given on the subject In 1916 the Reclama tion Securities Committee of the Investment Bankers Association made a determined effort to collect such statistics but found that in view of the above facts it was impossible of accomplishment THE CIRCUIT COURT DRAINAGE ACT OF MISSOURI As a concrete case it may be desir able to outline the salient features of the principal drainage act in Missouri This state possesses a drainage law as good as if not better than any of the other states in fact several of the states have to a large extent followed the Missouri act in the framing of their laws While there are several such acts in existence in this state the one most commonly used is known as the Cir cuit Court Drainage Act passed in 1913 This provides that the owners of a majority of the acreage in any contiguous body of swamp or over flowed land situated in one or more counties in the state may form a drainage district for the purpose of reclaiming such lands by framing articles of association in which is contained a full description of the lands sought to be included in the district as provided by the act together with the names of the owners of the same who thereby obligate themselves to pay a tax which may be assessed against their respective lands and to pay the expenses of organizing and of making and maintaining im provements These articles are filed in the office of the clerk of the circuit court of the county or in the event of the lands being situated in more than one county in the county in which the larger por tion of the land is situated Proper notice by newspaper publica tion as prescribed by the statute is then given by which the persons inter ested are notified to appear at court and show cause why the district should not be organized If the court over rules the objections the district is organized and declared a public corporation A certified copy of the decree is filed with the secretary of the state within sixty days and in the office of the recorder of deeds in each county having lands in the district A meeting of the landholders is then held through proper published notice giving ample time to interested parties to appear at which meeting a board of supervisors consisting of five land holders is elected two of whom must be residents of the counties having lands in the district Each landholder is entitled to one vote for each acre of land owned by him either in person or by proxy The persons elected to the board determine by lot their terms ofMODERN DRAINAGE BONDS 105 office which are one two three four and five years respectively Each succeeding year one member of the board is elected for five years to fill the term of the retiring member Proper oath is required for the faithful performance of his duties The board elects its own president and secretary and must adopt a seal and keep a record of its proceedings It likewise appoints a competent civil engineer who may with the approval of the board appoint assistants and consult with others The engineer so ap pointed must survey the lands file with the board annual reports which shall contain maps and profiles of the sur veys and a plan for reclamation of the lands which if adopted by the board becomes the plan for reclama tion A preliminary tax of not to exceed fifty cents per acre may be levied on all lands in or next to the district to provide for the payment of necessary organization expenses Within twenty days after the adoption of the plan the secretary of the board files a certified copy thereof with the clerk of the circuit court and the board thereupon must ask the court to appoint three commissioners to assess the benefits and damages who must reside in the state and must not be the owners of any land in the dis trict nor be related within the fourth degree of consanguinity to any land owner therein A majority of the commissioners control on all questions Proper oath is taken in writing for the faithful discharge of their duties at a meeting held within ten days after notice of their appointment by the circuit clerk The secretary of the board of supervisors is exofficio sec retary of this board and is required to attend all meetings and to furnish the necessary information as required by the statute Their duties begin within thirty days after qualifying The premises are viewed the benefits are assessed and the damages adjudged Public roads railroads etc are as sessed according to increased physical efficiency and decreased cost of main tenance The commissioners cannot change the plan of reclamation Proper notice is then given by the clerk of the circuit court by publica tion in accordance with the statute Exceptions may be filed by landowners within ten days from the date of the last publication of the notice The court then confirms or dissolves the organization If dissolved a uniform tax is levied to pay the costs incurred If confirmed a certified copy of the decree is furnished to the secretary of the board of supervisors who in turn files a copy in each county having lands in the district Appeals are allowed only on the two following questions First whether just com pensation has been allowed for prop erty appropriated second whether proper damages have been allowed for property prejudicially affected Broad powers are given the board of super visors to construct the necessary improvements or to let the contracts Proper bond must be given by each contractor for the faithful performance of the work The engineer must make a full report once each year to the board upon the work done with such suggestions as he may deem proper A tax is promptly levied by the board on each tract of land benefited in proportion to the benefits assessed sufficient to pay the cost of executing the plan plus 10 per cent for emergen106 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY cies together with the interest which will accrue on the bonds then issued This is certified in book form by the president and secretary of the board and made a permanent record with proper seal affixed Each year the board levies such a part of the taxes as may be necessary which is collected by the collector of the county in the same manner as other taxes full infor mation being given him by the district He must furnish proper bond and penalties are provided for his failure to return the proceeds promptly to the district The tax so levied together with the penalties for nonpayment becomes a lien upon each tract second only to the liens for state and county taxes Action for collection of delin quent taxes must be instituted within six months after December 31 of each year under the same procedure as in state and county taxes Title acquired at foreclosure sale is liable to payment of future annual levies Should the proceeds from the sale of any land for delinquent taxes prove insufficient to pay the tax the board has the right to reassess the entire district to cover such deficiency Proper bond is given by the treas urer and his accounts must be audited annually The board exercises full jurisdiction over all matters and has the right of eminent domain either within or without the district in accordance with the provisions of the statute Actions under this act do not abate by reason of the death of any landowner Proper notice how ever is given to the heirs at law in accordance with the statute Neither does any appeal delay any work The board of supervisors may petition the court to amend or change the incor poration decree Objections may be filed which are promptly determined by the court Bonds may be issued not to exceed 90 per cent of the total taxes levied with interest not exceeding 6 per cent per annum payable semiannually maturing serially within twenty years beginning not later than five years after date Such bonds cannot be sold at a price less than ninetyfive cents on the dollar and accrued inter est In the event the tax levy proves insufficient to pay the bonds and interest the board must make a sufficient additional levy not exceed ing however the aggregates of the benefits already adjudicated Each year the board levies a maintenance tax to pay current expenses and main tain the improvement in repair and this tax is limited to 10 per cent of the net benefits The owners of 25 per cent or more of the acreage may petition the organizing court for a readjustment of the assessment of benefits when any material change of property values has transpired but as a basis only in levying the maintenance tax Proper notice of such petition is given to landholders If the court orders a readjustment commissioners are appointed with full powers to act Two or more adjacent districts may unite providing proper notice is given to each landowner therein and a ma jority of the acreage votes favorably In this event the petition is presented to the court in the county containing the largest acreage Objections may be filed and the court acts in the same manner as upon petition on original organization The board may extend the corporate life of the district by calling an election and receiving theMODERN DRAINAGE BONDS 107 assent of the majority of the acreage represented Should the executed plan of recla mation prove insufficient amended plans may be designed and additional assessments made or if the tax levy should prove insufficient an additional levy may be made not exceeding the total benefits The board may also remove at pleasure any officer attor ney or employe The board may add additional land to the district pro vided however that after the com pletion of the plan this cannot be done without the written consent of the board and the approval of the district engineer Landowners so desiring or the district itself may petition the court for annexation of additional lands and from the courts decision an appeal may be prosecuted by the landowners or the district Districts organized under any previ ous law may elect to come under the provisions of this act under the same procedure as in the creation of a new district Attention might be especially direc ted to that portion of the statute which prescribes that in the event of failure of the proceeds resulting from the sale of land for taxes proving sufficient to pay the delinquent taxes the board of supervisors has the right to levy an additional tax on the entire district to make up the deficit and which in effect provides a thorough safeguard to the investor for the full payment of principal and interest in accordance with the tenor of the bonds DRAINAGE LAWS OF MISSOURI AND ARKANSAS COMPARED While as stated nearly every state possesses satisfactory drainage laws it might be of interest merely as a matter of comparison to mention the differences between the laws of Mis souri and Arkansastwo adjoining states whose laws while both excel lent differ to some extent in some of their essential features which differ ences are recited below Organization of District In Arkansas the petition praying for organization need be signed only by three or more owners In Missouri it is necessary that it be signed by owners of a majority of the acreage In Arkansas if the district lies wholly within one county the petition is presented to the county court If it lies in two or more counties it is presented to the circuit court of that county embracing the largest amount of land In Missouri it is presented to the circuit court in all cases In Missouri the supervisors may levy an organizationtax of not exceeding fifty cents on the acreage In Arkansas there is no such provision In Mis souri all those signing the petition obligate themselves to pay the tax and the case cannot be dismissed as to any one of the signers without the consent of all his cosigners Determination of the Plan of Reclama tion and the Assessment of Damages and Benefits In Arkansas the court appoints three commissioners who assisted by an engineer view the land determine the plan of reclamation and assess the damages and the benefits to the land embraced in the district In Missouri the court appoints five supervisors who constitute the governing board of the district and who in turn appoint three108 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY commissioners These commissioners then view the land and assess the benefits and damages In assessing benefits they do not consider those benefits which may be derived from any improvements other than those contemplated by the proceedings The supervisors themselves with the assist ance of an engineer determine the plan of reclamation which the commis sioners have no power to modify In Arkansas any owner dissatisfied with the assessment of damages may demand an assessment by a jury pro viding such demand is made within thirty days after the filing of the assessment Taxes In Arkansas the tax is levied by the commissioners in Missouri by the supervisors The board of commis sioners in Arkansas corresponds with the board of supervisors in Missouri and not with the Missouri board of commissioners In Arkansas the tax levy may be paid by anyone so desiring within thirty days after the levy otherwise it is payable in annual installments but no installment can be for more than 25 per cent of the total amount In Arkansas the tax is a lien preferred to demands executions encumbrances or liens whatsoever created In Missouri the tax is a lien inferior only to general state county school and road taxes Proceedings for Failure to Pay Tax In Missouri the land is sold in the manner provided for enforcement of delinquent taxes In Arkansas the tax collector reports delinquent taxes to the board of commissioners They then add 25 per cent to the amount and bring an action in the chancery court for jurisdiction If this is not done within sixty days any bondholder may bring such action An error in the name of the owner is not fatal and the proceedings are strictly in rem In case of judgment rendered against the land it is offered for sale subject to the lien of the tax due but not paid In case the land is not sold it is not again offered for one year nor until an attorney ad litem has been appointed He notifies the commissioners or directors of all other improvement districts taxes for which constitute liens against the land and he also notifies trustees for bondholders of the fact that the land has been offered for sale for delinquent taxes but has not been sold Upon the return of his report to this effect the court then orders that the land be sold free of the encumbrances of all other improve ment districts subordinate to the lien of the tax for which it is sold but sub ject to all subsequent installments of all taxes against it Any balance from the proceeds of the sale remaining after the tax and court costs have been paid is distributed by the court as seems equitable If any bond or coupon is not paid within thirty days after maturity any bondholder may sue in the chancery court for a receiver for the district to collect the taxes and forclose on the land paying the pro ceeds prorata among the bondholders Failure of Collector to Collect In Missouri the county collector of taxes must give a bond to the drainage district with two sureties in an amount double any probable assessment to be levied in any one year In case the collector for any cause neglects toMODERN DRAINAGE BONDS 109 collect the drainage tax a penalty of 10 per cent of the amount of tax which he has failed to collect is added to that amount and he and his sureties are liable therefor In Arkansas the col lector is fined one hundred dollars for each individual from whom he for any reason fails to collect the drainage tax while collecting other taxes He may be fined a like amount for each person whose tax he fails to record in the drainage tax book Bonds In Arkansas bonds must mature within thirty years in Missouri within twenty years In Missouri bonds must be payable in annual installments in from five to twenty years In Arkansas they may mature either serially or otherwise Readjustment of Assessments In Arkansas the commissioners may alter the plan of reclamation The modified plan is filed with the court and notice is given and parties inter ested are heard and the court enters its finding of fact If the assessment is thereby rendered inequitable any land owner who incurs additional damages is allowed such damages to be paid by the district but is not allowed to have the benefits assessed against his land to be reduced in the amount of the damages The original benefits re main unchanged and the land remains liable to taxation up to the amount of such original benefits Any damages allowed by reason of such change are inferior to the claims of bondholders In Missouri upon petition of 925 per cent of the owners stating that there has been a material change of values rendering the assessment of benefits inequitable the court if it finds this to be true appoints three commis sioners who reassess the benefits and through substantially the same pro ceedings as in the original assessments the benefits may be modified and readjusted as is equitable It may be added that in neither state can any change be made in such a way as to jeopardize the obligation or the secur ity of any bonds that may have been issued For many years all drainage statutes were most strictly construed it being the then current theory that govern ments could not levy taxes merely to improve lands privately owned but only to further some distinctly public purpose or in the exercise of the police power to prevent disease remove nuisances or conserve the public health In some states the statutes still require before a drainage or reclamation project can be initiated that there must be a court finding that the proposed improvement will be a public utility or that it will promote the public health or prevent disease In the course of time however a more liberal view was obtained and with a changing and now sympathetic attitude on the part of the owners of lands which are to be affected and taxed for the improvements many of these swamps and marshes have been redeemed and the way is at last open for the reclama tion of perhaps all the remainder of such lands SUCCESSFUL DRAINAGE PROJECTS While many large and successful drainage projects have been undertaken in recent years by far the largest and most pretentious undertaking has been that of the Little River Drainage110 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY District located in southeast Missouri It might be well to give a brief history of this district as an example of what can be accomplished in practical drainage Little River Drainage District in Missouri The acreage of the Little River Drainage District lies partly in each of the following six counties Cape Girardeau Stoddard Dunklin Scott New Madrid and Pemiscot There are 488050 acres of land within its boundary lines embracing territory approximately 90 miles long with an average width of 10 miles There are 160 miles of railroads within the dis trict Not an acre of land is more than six and onehalf miles from the rail road the average distance being three and onehalf miles The land had been subject to overflow from the Little River and the Castor River the waters of these rivers flowing into the district from the north This district was organized in 1907 Prior to that time several small drainage districts existed in lands that are located either wholly or in part in the territory now embraced in the above district It became evident at that time to some of the larger owners of land in that section that if this vast acreage was to be reclaimed as a whole a larger and more comprehensive plan would have to be carried out and one that would provide not only for the drainage of the land but also for the control and diversion of the waters from the Little and Castor rivers In order to pro vide full relief it was necessary to create a diversion channel and retain ing basins which would turn the flow of these waters into the Mississippi River at the head of the district thus preventing their overflowing the dis trict at certain periods of the year which had previously occurred After proper petitions had been received from a sufficient number of the land owners in this territory the Little River Drainage District was created in November 1907 bonds to the amount of 5000000 bearing 51 per cent interest were issued dated April 1 1913 and maturing serially in annual installments beginning April 1 1919 up to and including April 1 1933 Necessarily where such a large acreage was involved and where portions of previous drainage districts were to be merged into this one many legal obstacles presented themselves and it was not until 1913 that these were finally adjudicated by a decision of the supreme court of the state of Missouri in favor of the district While this decision perfected in every respect the legality of the bonds nevertheless the issue was further supported by the approving opinion of several of the ablest municipalbond lawyers in the country An able board of supervisors had previously been created in accordance with the law with headquarters at Cape Girardeau Missouri which is located about three miles north of the northern boundary of the district This issue was dis posed of in 1914 and the work on the district was then undertaken On account of the unusual size of the district it had unusual problems to meet Great care was exercised by the board in its selection of engineers and besides having its own chief engineer it had the approving opinion upon the drainage plan inauguratedMODERN DRAINAGE BONDS 111 of five of the leading hydraulic engi neers of the country At the time when this project was first undertaken approximately 90 per cent of the land was not subject to cultivation today about 75 per cent of the land can be cultivated and within four months it is expected that the work will be fully completed and all the land will be open for cultivation It was found in 1918 that due to the increased cost of operation and additional work found necessary the proceeds of the 5000000 bond issue would not be sufficient to complete the work Under the authority of the law an additional 1000000 of bonds were issued and promptly dis posed of It is estimated that before the work is finally completed another issue of at least onehalf million dollars of bonds will be necessary These bonds it is expected will be issued in the early part of 1920 and it is the firm belief that the work upon the district will be finally completed and the drainage plan perfected at least by July 1 1920 When this work is completed the land which was almost wholly a dismal swamp will become a very fertile and rich farming territory In 1907 the average value of the lands in the district was 10 to 15 per acre Today the land will easily average 75 per acre while the total bonded debt will upon completion be approximately 1450 per acre It will be seen from this that taking the highest average of the land in 1907 namely 15 per acreand adding the bonded debt of 1450 per acre the land has more than doubled in value It might be well to mention that in some instances land especially well located in this territory has sold as high as 225 per acre since the drainage plan was inaugurated As a further evidence of the improvement in that section as a result of this drainage project the little town of Bragg City Missouri having a population of some five hundred people with modern buildings and paved streets is in existence upon a site that was nothing but a swamp in 1914 In diverting the waters from the Castor and Little rivers to the Missis sippi River great care had to be exer cised in the engineering features particularly regarding the diversion channel and the retaining basins A spillway was constructed in order to give relief should the impounding of these waters create a greater pressure than the basins could withstand Unless such relief had been provided the construction might have given way and disastrous consequences to the district would have ensued Under extreme conditions the spillway provides for a partial overflow of the water into the district which though it might result in some partial damage to the crops would be far better than the greater damage that would be sustained by both life and property in the event of a serious break in any portion of the levee which might result from too great pressure It is not anticipated that any such occur rence will transpire but it was thought essential to provide for such a contin gency should it arise The payment of the principal and interest of any municipal bond accord ing to its tenor is necessarily dependent upon prompt collection of the taxes It might be interesting to note that since its inception this district has119 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY collected each year approximately 98 per cent of the drainage tax assessed against it which will unquestionably compare favorably with that of any municipality in the United States either large or small MARKET FOR DRAINAGE BONDS While fifteen years ago drainage bonds had a comparatively narrow market which was to some extent limited to those states located in the middle west where the drainage prob lem was better understood they have gradually increased in popularity and today enjoy a very substantial position in the eyes of investors throughout the entire country This has been due to a better and more general knowledge of the subject and to the record these issues have made in the payment of their principal and interest Many eastern bond houses which until a few years ago would not con sider handling drainage bonds are today eagerly buying large issues throughout the entire Mississippi Val ley The fact that such issues bear a higher return on the investment than the general obligations of counties and cities and possess the same tax exemption features has made them especially popular There is no doubt that drainage bonds issued under proper auspices constitute a safe investment Great care must be exer cised however upon the part of the investment houses handling such issues A careful examination of the land must first be made and it must be deter mined beyond any reasonable doubt that the work to be undertaken will result in an enhancement of the value of the land to a greater degree than the cost of the improvement It is impor tant that at least a majority of the landowners in the district be in favor of the project as a number of dissatis fied landholders would naturally seize the first opportunity to bring court proceedings and attack the legality of the issue Such litigation whether successful or not would necessarily throw a cloud upon the bonds and would also result in preventing the investment houses from promptly dis tributing them or in the event of their having been resold would create uneasiness upon the part of the investors holding them The amount of the debt per acre represented by the bonds must necessarily vary in proportion to the value of the land securing the issue Such debt should however always bear a proper and conservative relation to the appraised value of the district It should be seen that the affairs of the district are to be handled by a competent corps of officers and supervisors In a majority of cases the bond houses are now insisting where the law does not upon an annual audit of the books of the district to insure its affairs being kept in proper shape and to prevent the possibility of any loss of funds through defalcation or otherwise Above all else it must be certain that the engineering features have been passed upon by competent and practi cal engineers Where any doubt as to the feasibility of the plan exists consulting engineers should be called in so as to safeguard the project as far as it is possible to do so Great care should be exercised also to see that at least one competent engineer be re tained throughout the construction period in order to see that the work isMODERN DRAINAGE BONDS 113 properly completed in accordance with the original plan or where necessary to make any changes that such changes should be made under able direction It is also very essential that the work when completed should be maintained in excellent condition and kept in efficient working order The importance of the legal phases should never be overlooked All con servative and careful dealers in bonds exercise every caution to see that the legal steps in every issue purchased by them have received the approving opinion of a competent legal firm thoroughly experienced in municipal issues and in some instances issues are supported by two or three different opinions especially where any doubt exists in the minds of one firm upon any legal point involved Where proper precautions have been taken as suggested above and the bonds are recommended by a well known and responsible house the investor may feel no uneasiness when purchasing as to the safety of the investment Drainage bonds properly issued and conservatively constituted are a safe investment and are generally recognized as such by those competent to judge 9

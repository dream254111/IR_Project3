THE HUSBAND HAD NO ESTATE AS TENANT BY THE CURTESY INITIATE OR OTHERWISE DURING THE LIFETIME OF THE WIFE IN HER REAL ESTATE WHICH WAS MADE HER SEPARATE ESTATE BY THAT ACT THE DECISION IN EACH CASE SEEMS TOO PLAINLY RIGHT TO NEED COMMENT SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THAT ACT HOWEVER THE CODE HAS BEEN ADOPTED WHICH MADE MANY CHANGES IN THE LAW OF LEGAL SEPARATE ESTATES UNDER THE ACT OF APRIL 4 1877 AMENDED BY THE ACT OF MARCH 141878 THE WIFE COULD SELL HER SEPARATE REAL ESTATE AGAINST THE WILL OF HER HUSBAND AND IF SHOWN TO BE TO HER INTEREST A COURT OF EQUITY COULD  MAKE SUCH DECREE AS MIGHT

GIFT IF THE WIFE IS IN DEBTED AND DEVISE TO HER HUSBAND THE FEE IN HER REAL ESTATE AND HE ELECTS TO TAKE UNDER THE WILL A QUESTION AT ONCE ARISES AS TO THE RIGHTS OF THE RESPECTIVE CREDITORS THE SOLUTION OF THIS QUESTION DEPENDS UPON THE ANSWER TO ANOTHER WHETHER THERE IS MERGER OF THE LIFEESTATE OF THE HUSBAND AS TENANT BY THE CURTESY IN THE FEE DE VISED TO HIM BY THE WILL IF THERE IS SUCH MERGER IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE CREDITORS OF THE HUSBAND WOULD BE ENTITLED TO CHARGE THE PAYMENT OF HIS DEBTS ON HIS FEE SIMPLE ESTATE DEVISED BUT IN SUBORDINATION TO THE RIGHTS OF CREDITORS OF THE WIFE IF THERE IS NO MERGER THE RIGHTS OF THE HUSBANDS CREDITORS WOULD BE LIMITED TO 452 OCT1895 CAMPBELL V MBEE 453 HIS LIFEESTATE AS TENANT BY THE CURTESY AND THE REVERSION ONLY WOULD BE SUBJECTED TO THE WIFES DEBTS MERGER IS DESCRIBED AS THE ANNIHILATION OF ONE ESTATE IN ANOTHER IT TAKES PLACE USUALLY WHEN A GREATER AND LESS ESTATE COINCIDE AND MEET IN ONE AND THE SAME PERSON WITHOUT ANY INTERMEDIATE

or when in the opinion of the court it is proper a jury shall be impaneled unless etc Here the constitutional right of trial by jury is unequivocally preserved If an action is brought according to the course of the common law as it was at the time the Constitution was adopted in order to en title either party to a jury there must be an issue of fact to be tried This issue is reached by formal pleading in a common law action It can be reached in no other way in such action In the cumulative statutory remedy by motion it may be reached in the same way or more informally perhaps as sug gested by the court by the statement in writing of the grounds of defence to which the plaintiff may reply and thus make up an issue But in any event there can be no trial by jury except of an issue of fact made up in some way whether formally or informally This requirement does not violate the Consti tution for it is the same that existed when the Constitution was adopted and the statute simply does not dispense with it An instructive note on the general subject of such constitutional provisions may be found in 48 Am Dec 185194 See also 3 Am  Eng Encyc of Law 719722 and notes CAMPBELL TRUSTEE AND OTHERS V MCBEE AND ANOTHER Virginia Court of Appeals At Wytheville August 1 1895 1 SEPARATE ESTATE UNDER ACTS OF 1877 AND 1878Interest of husbandcur tesyjudgment against husband The husband has no interest during the life time of the wife in the real estate acquired by her as a separate estate under the Act of April 4 1877 as amended by the Act of March 14 1878 If the wife dies intestate and the husband is entitled to curtesy the judgment against the husband during the coverture will attach to his estate by the curtesy but in subordination to a deed of trust made by husband and wife during the coverture Appeal from a decree of the Circuit Court of Wythe county ren dered March 17 1894 in a suit in chancery wherein M K McBee and others were the complainants and the appellees and others were the defendants Reversed The opinion states the case Walker  Caldwell and A A Campbell for the appellants J A Sanders and Ro Crockett for the appellees  Reported by M P Burks State Reporter 450 OctCAMPBELL V MBEE HARRISON J delivered the opinion of the court Mary K McBee a married woman inherited from her mother one hundred and sixty acres of land and under the Acts of 18767 and 18778 she became seized and possessed of this inheritance as her legal separate estate During her coverture creditors of her husband obtained judgments against him and after these judgments were duly docketed the husband joined in a deed conveying this land to a trus tee to secure a loan made to the wife The wife died The children of Mary K McBee after her death instituted this suit to enjoin and restrain the trustee from enforcing collection of the debt secured in the deed of trust and set up the judgments against the husband as liens of prior dignity thereon An account of liens was ordered and the master reported said judgments as prior liens binding the life estate of the husband in the land The circuit court overruled all exceptions to this report and held that Milo McBee the husband of Mary K McBee was tenant by the curtesy of the land that this gave him a life estate therein which was liable to his judgment creditors as liens of higher dignity than the debt of the wife secured by deed of trust From this decree the case was brought to this court The land sought to be subjected to these liens is conceded to have been in her life time the legal separate estate of Mary K McBee held as such by virtue of the married womans act of 187678 It is un necessary to enter upon an elaborate consideration of this act It is comprehensive in defining the sole ownership and absolute character of the estate created in the wife by it She can devise it as if unmar ried can alien and encumber it and if her husband does not volun tarily unite with her in a deed parting with it she can pass an absolute title to it by invoking the aid of a court of equity The act guards the estate thus absolutely vested in the wife with great particularity from the debts and liabilities and from any and every power of the husband The hiusband has no interest during the wifes lifetime in the estate of the wife created by this Act and judgments against him can not attach to what does not exist If the wife does not alien her sepa rate real estate held under this Act in her lifetime the husband has curtesy in it at her death But when during her life time she has conveyed it to a trustee by deed united in by her husband to secure a debt then so far as the land is necessary to pay the debt thus secured he has no curtesy in it and the deed of trust is not affected by judg ments rendered against him 1895 451VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER In the case at bar the debt secured to the appellant Jennie Lawson in the trust deed from Mary K McBee and her husband to A A Campbell substituted trustee is a lien upon the land conveyed in that deed prior in dignity to the judgments audited against the appellee Milo McBee and must be first satisfied in full from the proceeds of sale before the judgment creditors can receive anything The decree of the circuit court appealed from is for the foregoing reasons erroneous and must be reversed and annulled and the cause remanded for further proceedings to be had therein in conformity with this opinion Reversed BY THE EDITORThe Act of Assembly construed in this case is the same construed by the court in Breeding v Davis 77 Va 639 It was there held that the husband had no estate as tenant by the curtesy initiate or otherwise during the lifetime of the wife in her real estate which was made her separate estate by that Act The decision in each case seems too plainly right to need comment Since the passage of that Act however the Code has been adopted which made many changes in the law of legal separate estates Under the Act of April 4 1877 amended by the Act of March 141878 the wife could sell her separate real estate against the will of her husband and if shown to be to her interest a court of equity could  make such decree as might may be necessary to convey abso lute title thereto and thereby defeat the curtesy of the husband No such power is conferred by Ch 103 of the Code On the contrary it is expressly provided that he shall have curtesy when the common law requisites therefor exist and that he shall not be deprived thereof by her sole act Section 2286 This right of a married woman having a separate estate under the Act of 1877 is expressly reserved to her by section 2298 of the Code The rights powers and liabilities of a married woman holding a separate estate under the Code are greatly enlarged over those conferred or imposed by the Acts of 1877 and 1878 The husband has no interest whatever in her separate estate under the Code during the coverture and no control over it but immediately upon the death of the wife the husband is entitled to curtesy if the common law requisites therefor exist and though the wife may devise it she cannot thereby deprive the husband of his curtesy Section 2286 Whie the wife may not deprive the husband of his curtesy there is no reason why she may not give him the whole or any part of her estate subject of course to the payment of her debts existing at the time of the gift If the wife is in debted and devise to her husband the fee in her real estate and he elects to take under the will a question at once arises as to the rights of the respective creditors The solution of this question depends upon the answer to another whether there is merger of the lifeestate of the husband as tenant by the curtesy in the fee de vised to him by the will If there is such merger it would seem that the creditors of the husband would be entitled to charge the payment of his debts on his fee simple estate devised but in subordination to the rights of creditors of the wife If there is no merger the rights of the husbands creditors would be limited to 452 Oct1895 CAMPBELL V MBEE 453 his lifeestate as tenant by the curtesy and the reversion only would be subjected to the wifes debts Merger is described as the annihilation of one estate in another It takes place usually when a greater and less estate coincide and meet in one and the same person without any intermediate estate whereby the less is immediately merged that is sunk or drowned in the greater To this result it is necessary that the two estates should be in one and the same person at one and the same time in one and the same right Garland v Panplin 32 Gratt on p 315 Little v Broen 76 Va on p 727 In Browune v Bockover 84 Va it seems to have been held see p 433 that though there was merger the judgments against the husband recovered during the coverture when he had no estate as tenant by the curtesy bound that estate when consummate in preference to the debts owing to the wifes creditors That can hardly be maintained upon the hypothesis that there was merger For if there was the husbands titles as tenant by the curtesy and devisee accrueld simultane nuwly and the merger was instantaneous There was not a moment when the life estate could be said to have existed separate from and independent of the fee How then could the judgment liens have attached to such lifeestate It never abided an instant in the tenant against whom the judgments had been recovered It was merged in the very act of coming into existence But quaere Was there merger in that case or would there be in like cases Professor Minor in considering the circumstances which must concur in order to accomplish the doctrine of merger states that the several estates must be held in the same legal right or when in different legal rights one of them must not be an accession to the other by the mere act of the lal i e it must be by pur Rhwe 3 Minors Insts 3d ed 424 citing 2 Th Co Lit As to the application of the

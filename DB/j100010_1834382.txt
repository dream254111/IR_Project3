enthusiasm for French principles under the iniflu ence of what the editor calls the  wine of French Republicanism  are treated in an interesting way Mr Pattee believes that the reason for Freneaus having passed into the shadow of neglect is not due to lack of real worth in the man but to prejudices born during the bitter and stormy period of partizan politics when Freneau played a conspicuous part winning the honor of arousing Washingtons wrath and being called by the staid Father of his Country I that rascal Freneau  The reader will be surprised to find how much the poems of this obscure

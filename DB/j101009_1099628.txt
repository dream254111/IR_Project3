IJnited States was passed by Congress in 1898 and duly ap proved by President McKinley on the 1st day of July of that year On the 17th of June 1902 an Act to amend the law was passed by the House of Representatives and on January 21 1903 the Senate passed the same with further amendments which were accepted by the House and the Act has been duly approved by the President These amendments are as follows 1 Comnpensation to officials for conducting business of the bank ruptClause 5 of section 2 of the original Act has been amend ed so as to allow receivers marshals or trustees conducting for limited periods the business of the bankrupts additional compen sation for such services but not at a greater rate than compensa tion allowed trustees which will be set forth in due time in this article It seems clear that this amendment only limits the power of the court in fixing receivers compensation to cases where the business of the bankrupts is actually conducted by such receivers as clause 3 of section 2 giving general jurisdiction for the appointment of receivers or marshals to take charge of the bankrupts estate1903 RECENT AMENDMENTS TO THE BANKRUPTCY ACT 719 has not been

that unless the judge shall otherwise direct the order shall be published not more than once a week for two consecutive weeks and the returnday shall be ten days after the last publication unless the judge shall for cause fix a longer time And instead of the bankrupt or any creditor appearing and pleading to the petition within ten days after the return day it is now provided that this may be done within five days after the return day 7 EvidenceBankrupts wife as a witnessUnder the head of Evidence section 21 a the wife of a bankrupt may be required to appear in court or before a referee or judge of any State court to be examined concerning the acts conduct or property of a bank rupt but with this provision that she may be examined only touching business transacted by her or to which she is a party and to determine the fact whether she has transacted or been a party to any business of the bankrupt 8 Suits by trusteesThe provision that suits by the trustees section 23 b shall only be brought or prosecuted in the courts where the bankrupt whose estate is being administered might have brought or prosecuted them if proceedings in bankruptcy had not been instituted unless by consent of the proposed defendant has been amended so that suits for the recovery of property under section 60 b may be brought in any court of bankruptcy as well as in any State court which would have had jurisdiction if bank ruptcy had not intervened and the amendment also includes suits for the recovery of property conveyed transferred assigned or encumbered with fraudulent intent or which is held null and void by the laws of any State as provided in sections 67 e and 70 e2 9 Duties of trusteesFiling copy of adjudication for record in 2 The following language is added to secs 60 b 67 e and 70 e  For the purpose of such recovery any court of bankruptcy as hereinbefore defined and any State court which would have had Jurisdidtion if bankruptcy had not intervened shall have concurrent Jurisdiction1903 RECENT AMENDMENTS TO THE BANKRUPTCY ACT 721 office of registry of deedsSection 47 is amended by adding there to a new subdivision c which is as follows  The trustee shall within thirty days after the adjudication file a certified copy of the decree of adjudication in the office where conveyances of real estate are recorded in every county where the bankrupt owns real estate not exempt from execution and pay the fee for such filing and he shall receive a compen sation of fifty cents for each copy so filed which together with the filing fee shall be paid out of the estate of the bankrupt as a part of the cost and disburse ments of the proceedings 10 Proof and allowance of claimsSurrender of preferences Section 57 g as amended reads as follows  The claims of creditors who have received preferences voidable under sectwn 60 subdivsion b or to whom conveyances transfers assignments or incumbranoe8 void or voidable under section 67 subdiviion e have been made or given shall not be allowed unless such creditors shall surrender such preferences conveyances trans fers assignments or incumbrance Amendments in italics It will be seen that the amendments to the section distinctly specify the preferences conveyances etc to be surrendered before any claims of those receiving them shall be allowed There was an utter lack of harmony in the decisions on the question of what had to be surrendered as a condition precedent to the allowance of a creditors claim until the Supreme Court held in Carson Pirie Scott  Co v Chicago Title  Trust Co8 that even a payment in money made by an insolvent debtor to a creditor the debtor not intending to give a preference and the creditor not having reason able cause to believe a preference was intended nevertheless con stituted a preference within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act and had to be surrendered before the balance of the debt or other claims of the creditor could be proved This decision was ex tremely unpopular with business men all over the country and they will hail with delight the change in the law 11 Debts which have priorityExpenses of creditors who have recovered estate of bankcruptSection 64 subdivision b clause 2 has been amended so as to empower the court to allow the reasonable expenses of one or more creditors who recover property of the bankrupt transferred or concealed by him when its recovery is

VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb filing fee instead of 10 as heretofore and 25 cents for filing proofs of claims the latter to be paid from the estate The com missions of trustees formerly 3 per centum on the first 5000 or less 2 per centtum on the second 5000 or part thereof and one per centum on excess of 10000 are now 6 per centum on the first 500 4 per centum on excess of 500 and less than 1500 and 2 per centuim on excess of 1500 and less than 10000 and one per centum on excess of 10000 The compensation of clerks remains as formerly 13 Exemption to bankruptDebts as to which exemption is waivedThe House of iRepresentatives added a new section to the law as follows viz That when the bankrupt in any State has waived his right to claim his exempt property to his creditors the bankruptcy court shall not set apart to him this exemption as against said creditors The Senate struck this out entirely and the law relative to ex emptions remains as heretofore Probably the leading case on the subject is Woodruff v Cheeves4 It was there held that the bank rtptcy court has no jurisdiction to protect and enforce the rights of creditors whose promissory notes contain a written waiver of the homestead and other exemptions authorized by any State law nor has such court any jurisdiction to enter an order allowing such claims or to declare liens against such exempt property in favor of creditors or to administer such property in their behalf in the meantime staying the discharge of the bankrupt until the rights of the creditors in whose favor the exemptions were waived are settled But the bankruptcy court has exclusive jurisdiction to determine all claims of the bankrupt to exemptions5 The Act of 1898 is also amended by the addition of the following sections Sec 72 Neither the trustee nor the referee shall in any form or guise re ceive nor shall the court allow them any other or further compensation for their services than that expressly authorized and prescribed in this Act Sec 19 The provisions of this amendatory Act shall not apply to bank ruptcy cases pending when this Act takes effect but such cases shall be disposed of conformably to the provisions of said Act

J100587,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16831775,105372,SOME REMARKS UPON THE SEVERAL ACCOUNTS OF THE FIERY METEOR WHICH APPEARED ON SUNDAY THE 26TH OF NOVEMBER 1758 AND UPON OTHER SUCH BODIES BY JOHN PRINGLE M D F R S,I206916,XXVII SOME REMARKS UPON THE SEVERAL AC COUNTS OF THE FIERY METEOR WHICH APPEARED ON SUNDAY THE 26TH OF NOVEMBER 1758 AND UPON OTHER SUCH BODIES BY JOHN PRINGLE M D F R S IN MY LAST PAPER I LAID BEFORE THE SO CIETY ALL THE ACCOUNTS I HAD RECEIVED OF THE METEOR OF THE 26TH OF NOVEMBER 1758 WHICH I COULD NOT REDUCE INTO A NARROWER COMPASS WITHOUT THE HAZARD OF OMITTING SUCH OBSERVATIONS AS MIGHT BE JUDGED NECESSARY FOR ASCERTAINING SOME OF THE PRINCIPAL CIRCUMSTANCES OR WITHOUT PASSING OVER THOSE FACTS WHICH HOWEVER IMMATERIAL THEY MAY APPEAR AT PRE SENT MIGHT AFTERWARDS AFFORD SOME LIGHT IN EXPLAINING THE NATURE OF THESE PHAENOMENA I HAVE EVEN INSERTED SOME PARTICULARS CONTRADICTORY TO OTHERS THAT IIMAGINED MORE LIKELY TO BE TRUE AS I MYSELF MIGHT BE DECEIVED AND AS BY PRESERVING THE SEVERAL RELATIONS INTIRE I THEREBY DID MOST JUSTICE TO THE OBSERVERS THE DE CEPTION OF THE SENSES UPON THE APPEARANCE OF UNUSUAL OBJECTS THE SHORT CONTINUANCE OF THE METEORS AND L L 2 THE READ DEC 20 1759260 THE SURPRIZE OCCASIONED BY THEM AT A LATE HOUR AMONG PEOPLE UNACCUSTOMED TO THINK ON THESE SUBJECTS WILL SUFFICIENTLY ACCOUNT NOT ONLY FOR THE VARIETY BUT THE CONTRADICTIONS IN THE SEVERAL OBSERVATIONS I COME NEXT TO THE RESULT OF ALL THE RELATIONS WITH REGARD TO THE TRUE PATH THE VELOCITY FIGURE MAGNI TUDE AND OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES RELATING TO THIS BODY WHICH HAVING DEDUCED IN THE BEST MANNER I COULD FROM THE PRECEDING MATERIALS I SHALL NOW SUBMIT TO THE JUDGMENT OF THE SOCIETY BUT AS MY LAST PAPER ON THIS SUBJECT WAS OF SO GREAT A LENGTH I SHALL NOT FAR THER INSIST ON IT NOW THAN BARELY TO MENTION THE CON CLUSIONS I HAVE MADE WITHOUT LOSING TIME IN RECAPI TULATING THE SEVERAL STEPS THAT LED ME TO THEM  FIRST THEN AS TO THE PATH THIS METEOR SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN VERTICAL AT CAMBRIDGE OR NEARLY SO AND TO HAVE TAKEN FIRE ABOUT THE ZENITH OF THAT PLACE OR AT LEAST TO HAVE APPEARED FIRST THERE IN A STATE OF IG NITION FROM THENCE IT PROCEEDED DIRECTLY ALMOST N W BY N OVER SEVERAL COUNTIES IN ENGLAND OVER THE SOLWAY FRITH WHICH IT CROSSED BETWEEN CARLISLE AND THE TOWN OF DUMFRIES AND IN SCOTLAND OVER THE SHIRES OF DUMFRIES AND LANERK BUT SOON AFTER ITS BE COMING VERTICAL TO THE LAST VIZ A FEW MILES TO THE SOUTHWARD OF DOUGLAS OR PERHAPS NEARER TO THE BOR DERS OF LANERK AND THE SHIRE OF AIR ABOUT 10 OR 12 MILES TO THE EASTWARD OF AUCHENLECK PART OF THE TAIL SEEMED TO BREAK OFF AND TO DISPERSE IN BRIGHT SPARKS OF FIRE WHILST THE HEAD INTO WHICH THE REMAINDER OF THE TAIL WAS INSTANTLY COLLECTED MOVED ON IN THE SAME  SOME OF THE MOST MATERIAL ARE SUBJOINED IN NOTES TO THE FORMER PAPER SINCE IT WAS FIRST PRESENTED TO THE SOCIETY DIRECTION261 DIRECTION TILL COMING OVER FORT WILLIAM IN THE SHIRE OF INVERNESS AFTER A COURSE OF ABOUT 400 MILES IT THERE SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THE EXTINCTION OF THE METEOR AT THIS PLACE IT SEEMS STILL TO HAVE PROCEEDED NORTH WARDS SINCE IT WAS SEEN AGAIN IN A LUMINOUS STATE IN A GLOBULAR FORM BUT WITHOUT A TAIL ABOUT THE 58O OF LATITUDE ON THE WESTERN COAST OF THE SHIRE OF ROSS ALMOST VERTICAL TO THE OBSERVER MOVING THEN TO THE SOUTHWARD OF THE EAST THAT IS IN A DIRECTION ALMOST CONTRARY TO THE FIRST AND IN THIS LAST COURSE OF WHICH WE KNOW NOT THE END IT POSSIBLY MIGHT HAVE GONE A GREAT WAY TO THE EASTWARD DURING THE FIRST PART OF ITS PROGRESS VIZ FROM CAMBRIDGE TO FORT WILLIAM IT WENT OBLIQUELY DOWN WARDS IN SUCH A MANNER THAT BY COMPUTATION IT MUST HAVE BEEN FROM ABOUT 90 TO 100 MILES HIGH AT THE FIRST OF THESE PLACES AND BETWEEN 26 AND 32 MILES AT THE LAST BUT AT WHAT HEIGHT IT WAS AFTERWARDS SEEN IN THE SHIRE OF ROSS IS NOT TO BE DETERMINED SINCE ONE OBSERVATION ONLY WAS TRANSMITTED TO ME FROM THAT COUNTRY AS DR MACKENZIE OBSERVED IT NEARLY OVER HIS HEAD AND YET OF A SMALLER SIZE THAN THE FULL MOON WHEN SOME HOURS ABOVE THE HORIZON I SHOULD SUSPECT THAT AFTER ITS DESCENT TO FORT WILLIAM IT HAD RE ASCENDED AT THE TIME HE SAW IT BECAUSE HE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE DESCRIBED IT AS A LARGER BODY IF THEN NOT HIGHER THAN WHEN IT FIRST DISAPPEARED THIS DIPPING AND RISING IN THE COURSE OF A METEOR IS NOT MORE EXTRAORDINARY THAN ITS LATERAL DEVIATION FROM A STREIGHT LINE AS I HAVE ELSEWHERE SHEWN  SUCH  SEE THE NOTE SUBJOINED TO OBS XXVII ARE262 ARE THE FACTS THO PERHAPS IT MAY BE HARD TO ACCOUNT FOR THEM FROM THE COMMON PRINCIPLES OF MOTION WHAT SEEMED MOST LIKELY TO BE THE CAUSE OF THE VERTI CAL CHANGE OF ITS DIRECTION WAS ITS RAPID DESCENT TO WARDS THE EARTH TILL IT CAME SO LOW AS THAT THE RESISTANCE OF THE AIR MIGHT ACT UPON IT IN WHICH CASE THE LOWER PART OF THE BODY MEETING WITH DENSER AIR THAN THE UP PER IT WOULD BE SO REFLECTED FROM THAT MEDIUM AS TO ASCEND FOR THO AT THE HEIGHT OF 20 OR 30 MILES THE AIR IS EXTREMELY RARIFIED YET IN THIS INSTANCE THE IM MENSE VELOCITY OF THE IMPINGENT BODY WILL MAKE A LESS RESISTING MEDIUM PRODUCE A GREATER EFFECT THE METEOR THEREFORE MIGHT BE REFLECTED BY THE AIR IN THE SAME MANNER AS A CANNON BALL BY WATER WHEN IT STRIKES IT IN A VERY OBLIQUE DIRECTION IF THIS REASONING CAN BE ADMITTED WE MAY ACCOUNT FOR THE LATERAL VARIATION OF ITS PATH IN THE MANNER FOLLOWING ALTHOUGH IT SHOULD SEEM THAT DURING THE FIRST PART OF THE COURSE THE WIND WAS AT S E YET WHEN THE METEOR ADVANCED TOWARDS THE NORTH OF SCOTLAND IT THERE PROBABLY MET WITH A WESTERLY WIND FROM THIS CIRCUMSTANCE IN DR MACKENZIES LETTER OF THE SEA BEING THAT NIGHT REMARKABLY LOUDER THAN AT ANY OTHER TIME DURING A WHOLE MONTH HE HAD BEEN AT FLOW ERDALE FOR THAT PLACE LIES ON THE WESTERN OCEAN IN THE SHIRE OF ROSS AND THERE I IMAGINE THE SEA COULD NOT PRODUCE THAT STORMY NOISE UNLESS THE WIND HAD BLOWN FROM SOME POINT BETWEEN THE WEST AND THE NORTH IF THEREFORE THE CURRENT OF THE AIR OBLIQUELY OPPOSED THE MOTION OF THE METEOR THAT BODY WOULD BE GRADUALLY REFLECTED INTO A NEW DIRECTION FROM WHICH BY ANOTHER CURRENT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN TURNED A SECOND OR A THIRD TIME UNTIL IT FELL AT LAST INTO THAT PATH263 PATH DESCRIBED BY THE DOCTOR FROM THIS ACCOUNT IT WILL FOLLOW THAT THE LOWER A METEOR DESCENDS THE MORE IRREGULAR ITS COURSE WILL BE AS IT WILL THEN MEET WITH THE MOST RESISTANCE BOTH FROM THE DENSITY AND THE CURRENTS OF THE AIR IN REGARD TO THE VELOCITY IT SEEMS ALMOST INCREDIBLE AS WE HAVE SUFFICIENT DATA FOR COMPUTING IT AT THE RATE OF 30 MILES IN A SECOND BUT IF WE ALLOW THAT IT ONLY MOVED THROUGH HALF THE SPACE IN THAT TIME WE SHALL FIND THE PROGRESSION OF THIS BODY TO HAVE BEEN ABOVE 100 TIMES SWIFTER THAN THE MEAN CELERITY OF A CANNON BALL AND NEARLY EQUAL TO THAT OF THE EARTH IN ITS ORBIT ROUND THE SUN AS TO ITS REAL SIZE WE CANNOT PRETEND TO DETERMINE THAT POINT WITH ANY PRECISION SINCE ITS DAZZLING BRIGHTNESS WOULD OCCASION SOME DECEPTION AND THE APPARENT MAGNITUDE HAS BEEN SO DIFFERENTLY REPRE SENTED BY THE OBSERVERS IF THE METEOR WHEN NEAREST TO DUBLIN APPEARED TO MR GARRET EQUAL TO THE FULL MOON THEN WE SHALL FIND THAT ITS TRUE DIAMETER WAS ABOUT TWO MILES AND IF THE FARMER AT ANCRAM SAW THIS BODY WHILST IT WAS VERTICAL AT CAMBRIDGE OF A SIZE EQUAL TO THE CROWN OF HIS CAP OR TO ABOUT HALF THAT OF THE FULL MOON WE CANNOT ALLOW LESS THAN A MILE FOR THE REAL AXIS UPON ESTIMATING FROM THE OBSERVATIONS MADE AT ST ANDREWS AND DUNFERMLINE THE DIAMETER WAS AT LEAST HALF A MILE AND PERHAPS MUCH GREATER HOWEVER AS THE IMAGINATION IS SO APT TO ENLARGE SUCH OBJECTS WE SHALL PUT THE SIZE OF THE GLOBE AT THE SMALLEST AND RECKON IT ONLY ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF ROUND THE BODY MUST SURELY HAVE BEEN OF A CONSIDERABLE BULK TO HAVE YIELDED SUCH A LIGHT AS THAT WHEN IN THE ZENITH264 ZENITH OF CAMBRIDGE THE FARMER AT ANCRAM AT THE DISTANCE OF ABOVE 260 MILES SHOULD UPON ENTERING HIS THRESHOLD SEE THE WHOLE SIDE OF HIS HOUSE ILLUMI NATED BY IT AND TO USE HIS OWN EXPRESSION WITH A BRIGHTNESS AS OF SUNSHINE AND INDEED THE GREATNESS OF THE LIGHT IS EVERYWHERE TAKEN NOTICE OF EVEN AT THOSE PLACES WHERE THE ATMOSPHERE WAS SO THICK AS TO HIDE THE TAIL NAY THE WHOLE METEOR AS AT AUCHEN LECK WHERE IT WAS NEARLY VERTICAL AS FOR THE TAIL IT WAS A STREAM OF LIGHT SEVERAL MILES IN LENGTH FOR THIS WAS NO DECEPTION LIKE WHAT WE SUPPOSE THE TRAIN OF A SHOOTING STAR TO BE BUT WAS EITHER A REAL FLAME OR WHAT IS MORE PROBABLE IT CONSISTED PARTLY OF FLAME BUT MOSTLY OF SMALLER MASSES OF FIRE WHICH THE OBSERVERS CALL SPARKS WHEN FALL ING OUT OF THE LUCID TRACT AND OF VAPOURS OR FULIGI NOUS PARTICLES NOT HEATED REDHOT BUT ILLUMINATED BY THE PARTS ACTUALLY BURNING PERHAPS THESE VAPOURS WERE THE CHIEF PART OF THE COMPOSITION AND WHICH WILL ACCOUNT FOR ITS LIGHT BEING SO MUCH FAINTER THAN THAT OF THE HEAD SINCE IN SOME PLACES WHERE THE AIR WAS LESS CLEAR OR THE DISTANCE GREATER WE FIND THE WHOLE METEOR DESCRIBED EITHER AS A ROUND BALL OR A SPHEROID WITH THE LARGEST AXIS IN THE DIRECTION OF ITS MOTION BUT WITHOUT A TAIL IN THIS LAST CASE VIZ THAT OF THE OVAL FORM IT IS PROBABLE THAT BESIDES THE HEAD THE BEGINNING OF THE TAIL WAS ALSO VISIBLE AS CONSISTING OF FLAME AND THEREFORE BRIGHTER THAN THE REST AND THAT BOTH TOGETHER APPEARED OBLONG TO THOSE OBSERVERS BUT SUCH AS WERE NEAREST AND HAD A CLEAR ATMOSPHERE SAW THE TAIL OF A CONSIDERABLE LENGTH THAT IS THE FLAME THE SPARKS AND THE ILLUMINATED VAPOUR IN A TRAIN BEHIND THE HEAD AS BEING LIGHTER 3 AND265 AND THEREFORE MEETING WITH MORE RESISTANCE FROM THE AIR IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE FLAME THE SPARKS AND SMOAK OF A TORCH ARE SEEN TO FOLLOW IT ALL THIS IS PLAIN BUT IN REGARD TO THAT SEPARATION OF THE THIRD PART OF THE TAIL FROM THE REST A CIRCUMSTANCE CLEARLY DE SCRIBED BY THE FARMER AT ANCRAM AND SEEMINGLY CON FIRMED BY OTHER OBSERVATIONS THERE MAY BE SOME DIFFICULTY PERHAPS AT THIS PERIOD UPON A GREATER EXPLOSION IN THE BALL MOST OF THE COMBUSTIBLE MATTER WAS THROWN OUT AT ONCE WHICH FALLING BEHIND OCCA SIONED THAT APPEARANCE OF THE BREAKING OFF A PART OF THE TAIL WHILST FOR WANT OF FUEL THE REMAINDER VA NISHED OR AS THE OBSERVER EXPRESSES IT WAS COLLECTED INTO THE HEAD THIS ACCOUNT IS RENDERED MORE PRO BABLE BY WHAT IS SAID OF THE EMISSION OF A GREATER LIGHT ABOUT THIS TIME AND BY THE LOUD REPORT HEARD BY THE FARMER FIVE MINUTES AFTER AND WHICH UPON COMPUTING THE DISTANCE OUGHT TO HAVE REACHED HIM MUCH ABOUT THAT TIME HAD IT BEEN OCCASIONED BY THIS EXTRAORDINARY BURSTING AND DISPERSION OF THE INFLAM MABLE MATTER THE HISSING NOISE TAKEN NOTICE OF BY SOME WHILE THE METEOR PASSED THEM WAS A DECEPTION OF THAT KIND WHICH FREQUENTLY CONNECTS SOUND WITH MOTION AND IS THE CASE OF THOSE WHO FANCY THEY HEAR SOMETHING WHEN THEY SEE THE SHOOTINGS OF THE AURORA BOREALIS I SAY A DECEPTION BECAUSE IF THE METEOR DURING ITS COURSE REALLY MADE ANY NOISE SO GREAT WAS THE DIS TANCE OF THAT BODY AND SO SHORT ITS CONTINUANCE THAT THIS SOUND COULD NOT HAVE BEEN HEARD TILL SOME MI NUTES AFTER THE RETURN OF DARKNESS BUT THE FINAL RE PORT SO FREQUENTLY MENTIONED NOT ONLY HEARD BY THOSE WHO SAW THE LIGHT BUT BY OTHERS WHO KNEW V O L LI M M NOTHING266 NOTHING OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED WAS A REAL SOUND AND IMMENSELY GREATER THAN ANY WE ARE ACQUAINTED WITH FOR AT THE DISTANCE OF 70 MILES AND UPWARDS IT WAS COMPARED TO LOUD THUNDER THE REPORT OF HEAVY ARTIL LERY THE FALL OF THE GABELEND OF THE HOUSE THE PERSON WAS IN AND TO A MUSKET FIRED OFF IN THE GARRET IF THIS NOISE WAS PRODUCED WHEN THE BODY THREW OUT THOSE MASSES OF BURNING MATTER BY THE OBSERVERS CALLED SPARKS OF FIRE THE BURSTING OF THE TAIL AND DE LINEATED IN FIG 5 AS BALLS OF A SMALLER SIZE IN THE TRAIN ITSELF WE SHALL FIND THAT AT THIS TIME THE ME TEOR BY BEING MORE THAN 41 MILES HIGH WAS IN A REGION WHERE THE AIR IS THREE THOUSAND TIMES RARER THAN ON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH THAT IS ABOUT SIX TIMES RARER THAN IN A COMMON EXHAUSTED RECEIVER WHERE SONOROUS BODIES ARE NOT HEARD AND EVEN WHERE GUNPOWDER AND THE PULVIS FULMINANS TAKE FIRE AND ARE EXPLODED BUT WITHOUT NOISE HENCE I WOULD INFER THAT THE SEPARATION OF THE ELASTIC MATTER MUST HAVE BEEN PERFORMED WITH A VELOCITY EXCEEDING ALL IMAGINATION AS THE INTENSITY OF SOUND SO MUCH DEPENDS ON THE RESISTANCE OF THE AIR AND AS THIS ELA STIC MATTER COULD FLY OFF WITH SO MUCH CELERITY AS TO FIND SO GREAT AN OPPOSITION FROM SO THIN A MEDIUM  I SHOULD ALSO CONCLUDE FROM THE GREAT REPORT THAT THE SUBSTANCE OF THE METEOR WAS OF A FIRMER TEXTURE THAN WHAT COULD ARISE FROM MERE EXHALATIONS WHE THER FORMED INTO A SPHERE AND THEN BURNING OR DIS  M SALUCE HAS LATELY SHEWN BY SOME CURIOUS EXPERIMENTS THAT SUCH SUBSTANCES AS GUNPOWDER AND THE PULVIS FULMINANS HAVE A DE TONATION IN PROPORTION TO THE RAPIDITY WITH WHICH THE INTERNAL AIR IS SEPARATED AND TO THE RESISTANCE OF THE EXTERNAL AIR SEE MISCELL TAURINENS TOM I POSED267 POSED INTO A KIND OF TRAIN AND CONSUMED BY A RUN NING FIRE FOR SOUNDS AS FAR AS WE KNOW ARE EITHER PRODUCED BY THE QUICK AND VIOLENT PERCUSSIONS OF HARD BODIES UPON THE AIR OR BY THE SUDDEN EXPANSION OF AN ELASTIC FLUID AFTER BEING CONDENSED WITHIN SOME SOLID SUBSTANCE THE NOISE OCCASIONED BY THE MOTION OF ELECTRICAL MATTER IS PERHAPS THE ONLY EXCEPTION BUT WE HAVE NO REASON TO IMAGINE THAT THIS WAS AT ALL CONCERNED IN THE PRESENT CASE THERE SEEMS TO BE THE MORE GROUND FOR BELIEVING THIS BODY WAS SOLID AT LEAST THAT ITS SURFACE WAS SO FROM FINDING THAT AFTER THE VIOLENT EXPLOSION IT STILL RETAINED ITS FORM A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT COULD HARDLY TAKE PLACE IF THE METEOR HAD CONSISTED OF NOTHING BUT VAPOURS WE MAY THEREFORE PRESUME THAT THE BURNING MATTER FOUND VENT THROUGH A HARD CRUST BY CERTAIN APERTURES WHICH EITHER MIGHT HAVE BEEN THERE INVISIBLE OR UN OBSERVED ALL I CAN SAY IN SUPPORT OF THIS CONJECTURE IS THAT BY THE MEMOIRES OF THE ACADEMY OF BO LOGNA WE FIND A METEOR APPEARED IN ITALY IN THE YEAR 1719 LOWER IN THE AIR THAN THAT WE HAVE NOW BEEN TREATING OF AND IN WHICH IT IS PRETENDED FOUR SEVERAL CHASMS WERE DISTINGUISHED EACH EMITTING SMOKE  TO THESE ARGUMENTS FOR THE SOLIDITY OF THIS BODY WE MAY ADD ITS EXTREME VELOCITY AND THE IN TENSITY OF THE LIGHT WHICH ARE LIKEWISE CIRCUMSTANCES MORE CONFORMABLE TO A HEAVY AND SOLID SUBSTANCE THAN TO ONE FORMED OF EXHALATIONS ONLY UPON THE WHOLE I BELIEVE IT WILL APPEAR THAT THESE RELATIONS ARE NOT FAVOURABLE TO THE PREVAILING  APPAREBANT IN EO HIATUS SEU VORAGINES QUATUOR FUMUM EXHALANTES INSTIT  ACAD BONON TOM I P 285 M M 2 HYPO268 HYPOTHESIS ABOUT THE FORMATION OF SUCH BODIES WHICH MAKES THEM TO CONSIST OF CERTAIN SULPHUREOUS VAPOURS ARISING FROM THE EARTH FOR BESIDES WHAT HAS BEEN URGED ABOVE DR HALLEY HAS SHEWN  THAT AT THE  HEIGHT OF 41 MILES THE AIR IS SO RARIFIED AS TO TAKE  UP 3000 TIMES THE SPACE IT OCCUPIES ON THE SURFACE  OF THE EARTH AND THAT AT 53 MILES HIGH IT WOULD  BE EXPANDED ABOVE 30000 TIMES BUT THINKS IT IS  PROBABLE THAT THE UTMOST POWER OF ITS SPRING CANNOT  EXERT ITSELF TO SO GREAT AN EXTENSION AND THAT NO  PART OF THE ATMOSPHERE REACHES ABOVE 45 MILES  THIS BEING THE CASE HOW CAN WE SUPPOSE ANY SUCH VAPOURS TO RISE TO THE HEIGHT OF 90 OR 100 MILES WHERE THE AIR MUST BE SO MANY MILLIONS OF TIMES RARER THAN WHAT WE BREATHE AGAIN WE FIND THAT ALL VAPOURS IN THEIR ASCENT MUTUALLY REPEL ONE OTHER SO LITTLE DO THEY SEEM DISPOSED TO RUN TOGETHER INTO GLOBES OF SUCH A SIZE BUT DR HALLEY OBSERVES IN TREATING OF THE GREAT METEOR OF MARCH 1719  THAT  THO THE AQUEOUS AND MOST OF THE OTHER VAPOURS  ARE SOON CONDENSED BY COLD AND WANTING A CERTAIN  DEGREE OF SPECIFIC GRAVITY IN THE AIR TO BUOY THEM  UP ASCEND BUT TO A SMALL HEIGHT YET HE ADDS IN FAVOUR OF THE OPINION OF THESE BODIES BEING FORMED OF EXHALATIONS THAT THE INFLAMMABLE SULPHUREOUS  VAPOURS BY AN INNATE LEVITY HAVE A SORT OF VIS  CENTRIFUGA AND NOT ONLY HAVE NO NEED OF THE AIR  TO SUPPORT THEM BUT BEING AGITATED BY HEAT WILL  ASCEND IN VACUO BOILEANO FROM HENCE HE INFERS  THAT THE SULPHUREOUS VAPOURS DISENGAGED FROM ALL  OTHER PARTICLES MAY RISE FAR ABOVE THE REPUTED  PHIL TRANS NO 181 P 104 ABRIDG VOL II CH 1  9  LIMITS269  LIMITS OF THE ATMOSPHERE AND CONTRACTING THEM  SELVES INTO A NARROWER COMPASS BY THAT PRINCIPLE  OF NATURE THAT CONGREGATES THE HOMOGENEA MAY LIE  LIKE A TRAIN OF GUNPOWDER IN THE AETHER TILL CATCH  ING FIRE BY SOME INTERNAL FERMENT THE FLAME MAY  BE COMMUNICATED TO ITS CONTINUED PARTS AND SO  RUN ON LIKE A TRAIN FIRED C  BUT THIS HYPO THESIS OF THAT EXCELLENT NATURALIST SEEMS LIABLE TO THE FOLLOWING DIFFICULTIES 1 WHAT ARE THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH SHEW THAT INFLAMMABLE VAPOURS HAVE ANY SORT OF A VIS CENTRIFUGA OR WILL RISE EITHER IN AN ABSOLUTE VACUUM OR IN A MEDIUM WHERE THE METEORS ARE OFTEN FOUND AND WHERE ACCORDING TO THE DOCTOR THE AIR MUST BE FIVE HUNDRED TIMES RARER THAN IN A COMMON

INCREASED BY THE LARGE QUANTITY OF CONDENSED AIR OR SOME OTHER ELASTIC FLUID COMBINED WITH THE INFLAM MABLE VAPOURS WHICH IS THE CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION AND REPORT 5 ARE WE NOT LED TO THIS NOTION ABOUT

THOUSAND TIMES RARER THAN WHAT WE BREATHE THAN270 THAN DOWNWARDS BUT IS NOT THIS OWING TO THAT POR TION OF THE AIR WHICH RECEIVING THE HEAT AND BEING THEREBY DILATED BECOMES SPECIFICALLY LIGHTER THAN THE REST AND THEREFORE RISES IN THE COLDER AND MORE CON DENSED ATMOSPHERE 6 SUPPOSE ATTRACTION TO TAKE PLACE SHOULD NOT THOSE VAPOURS BY THAT LAW ASSUME A GLOBULAR FORM AND NOT LIKE A TRAIN CONTRACT IN BREADTH AND EXTEND IN LENGTH 7 WHAT IS TO SET THIS TRAIN ON FIRE SINCE A FERMENT ACCORDING TO THE CHEMISTS IMPLIES A MIXTURE OF HETEROGENEOUS PARTS CONTRARY TO THE DOCTORS HYPOTHESIS 8 HOW COMES THIS TRAIN TO BE DRAWN OUT IN SO STREIGHT A LINE AND OF SO EQUAL A BREADTH INSOMUCH THAT IN THE PATH OF THE LATE METEOR FOR ABOUT 400 MILES THERE WAS NO SENSIBLE DEVIATION NOR ANY CHANGE IN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE LUMINOUS APPEARANCE BUT WHAT MIGHT BE ACCOUNT ED FOR FROM ITS GREATER OR LESS DISTANCE FROM THE OB SERVER OR ITS BEING SEEN THROUGH A CLEARER OR AN OB SCURER ATMOSPHERE SOME HAVE BEEN OF OPINION THAT THESE FIERY METEORS ARE ONLY A KIND OF LIGHTNING AT GREATER HEIGHTS THAN COMMON FORMING THEIR NOTION UPON THE VELOCITY OF THOSE BALLS OF FIRE AND UPON THE SOUND ACCOMPANYING THEM SO MUCH RESEMBLING THAT OF THUNDER BUT THIS HYPOTHESIS HAVING GAINED NO CRE DIT I NEED NOT EMPLOY TIME IN REFUTING IT AND THE LESS NOW AS THE NATURE OF LIGHTNING IS SO MUCH BETTER UNDERSTOOD THAN WHEN THIS THEORY WAS FIRST PUBLISHED I SHALL ONLY OBSERVE THAT BEFORE THE MATTER OF LIGHT NING WAS DISCOVERED TO BE OF THE ELECTRICAL KIND IT WAS NATURAL TO SUPPOSE IT TO BE FORMED OF THE SULPHUREOUS VAPOURS ARISING FROM THE EARTH AND IF THE EARTH WAS FOUND PROPER FOR PRODUCING SUCH EXHALATIONS OF COURSE271 COURSE IT WAS JUDGED CAPABLE OF FURNISHING MATERIALS FOR ALL THE LUCID PHAENOMENA IN THE AETHEREAL REGIONS THUS NOT AN HUNDRED YEARS AGO THE COMETS THEM SELVES WERE ACCOUNTED FOR ON NO BETTER PRINCIPLE AND THEREFORE WE ARE THE LESS TO WONDER IF THESE METEORS HAVE BEEN HITHERTO ALMOST CONSTANTLY REFERRED EVEN BY THE BEST NATURALISTS TO THE SAME ORIGIN OF ALL THE HYPOTHESES THAT HAVE COME TO MY KNOW LEGE ON THIS SUBJECT A HINT OF DR HALLEYS IN A PAPER PRESENTED TO THE SOCIETY SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE THE ABOVEMENTIONED SEEMS BEST TO AGREE WITH THE LATE METEOR VIZ THAT SUCH BODIES MAY BE FORMED INDE PENDENT OF ANY VAPOURS FROM THE EARTH  BUT WITH REGARD TO THE REST OF HIS CONJECTURE THAT THE ONE HE DESCRIBED  MIGHT BE A COLLECTION OF MATTER FORMED IN  THE AETHER BY SOME FORTUITOUS CONCOURSE OF ATOMS  AND THAT THE EARTH HAD MET WITH IT NEWLY FORMED  AND BEFORE IT HAD CONCEIVED ANY GREAT IMPETUS OF  DESCENT TOWARDS THE SUN I SAY WITH REGARD TO THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THEY ARE NOT AT ALL SUPPORTED BY THE PRESENT CASE FOR IF WE CONSIDER THE IMMENSE VELOCITY WITH WHICH THE LATE METEOR MOVED NORTH WARDS AND IN JUDGING OF WHICH WE COULD NOT BE DE CEIVED BY EITHER THE DIURNAL OR ANNUAL MOTION OF THE EARTH WE MUST BE CONVINCED THAT THE EARTH DID NOT MEET WITH IT BEFORE IT HAD CONCEIVED A CONSIDERABLE IMPETUS OF DESCENT EITHER TOWARDS THE SUN OR SOME OTHER ATTRACTING POWER AND ALTHO THERE WAS LIKEWISE A MOTION OF THIS BODY TOWARDS THE EARTH AS APPEARED BY THE DIPPING OF ITS PATH YET IT DID NOT COME QUITE DOWN  PHIL TRANS NO 341 P 159 ABR VOL IV PAR II CH 1  25 AS272 AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED HAD GRAVITATION TO THE EARTH BEEN THE ONLY PRINCIPLE CONCERNED BUT IT DE SCENDED NO LOWER THAN TO A CERTAIN DEPTH IN THE ATMO SPHERE AFTER WHICH IT SEEMS TO HAVE RISEN AGAIN AND MADE A CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS IN THE HIGHER REGIONS CONTRARY TO DR HALLEYS OPINION ABOUT SUCH METEORS WHICH HE BELIEVED ACTUALLY CAME TO THE GROUND  AND HERE I WILL VENTURE TO AFFIRM THAT AFTER PERUSING ALL THE ACCOUNTS I COULD FIND OF THESE PHAENOMENA I HAVE MET WITH NO WELLVOUCHED INSTANCE OF SUCH AN EVENT NOR IS IT TO BE IMAGINED BUT THAT CONSIDERING THE FREQUENCY OF SUCH APPEARANCES IF THESE METEORS HAD REALLY FALLEN THERE MUST HAVE BEEN LONG AGO SO STRONG EVIDENCE OF THE FACT AS TO LEAVE NO ROOM TO DOUBT OF IT AT PRESENT THEIR DESCENT UNDER THE HO RIZON IS SUFFICIENT TO MAKE THE COMMON OBSERVERS BELIEVE THEY SEE THEM COME TO THE GROUND WHILST AN EXPLOSION HIGH UP IN THE AIR COMING LATE TO THEIR EARS PASSES FOR THE CRASHING NOISE OF THE FALL NOT THAT I CALL IN QUESTION THE POSSIBILITY OF THEIR TOUCHING THE EARTH WHICH THEY ARE LIKELY TO DO AS OFTEN AS THEY MOVE PERPENDICULARLY TOWARDS IT AND NOT IN THAT OB LIQUE DIRECTION SO OFTEN MENTIONED AND BY WHICH MEANS IT SHOULD SEEM THEY ARE CONSTANTLY REFLECTED BY OUR ATMOSPHERE ALL THAT I WOULD CONCLUDE IS THAT HITHERTO WE HAVE HAD NO CERTAIN PROOF OF THEIR FALL AND IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT THEIR MOTIONS LIKE THOSE OF THE COMETS HAVE BEEN SO REGULATED AT FIRST BY A GOVERNING POWER THAT WE HAVE NOTHING TO APPRE HEND FROM THEIR ABERRATION UNLESS WE SHOULD IMA GINE THAT THE PERPENDICULAR DESCENT AND BURSTING OF  VIDE LOC CIT ONE273 ONE OF THESE BODIES HAS GIVEN RISE TO THE STORY OF PHAETON SINCE NO OTHER EVENT WILL PERHAPS SO WELL ACCOUNT FOR NOT ONLY THE FOUNDATION OF THAT FABLE BUT FOR A PREVAILING OPINION AMONG THE ANCIENTS THAT BESIDES A LARGE TRACT OF COUNTRY EVEN THE HEAVENS THEMSELVES IN APPEARANCE HAD ONCE SUFFERED BY A CONFLAGRATION IF IT IS THEN PROBABLE THAT THESE BALLS OF FIRE COME FROM REGIONS FAR BEYOND THE REACH OF OUR VAPOURS IF THEY APPROACH OFTEN SO NEAR TO THE EARTH AND SO SELDOM OR NEVER TOUCH IT IF THEY ARE MOVED WITH SO MUCH CELERITY AS IN THAT RESPECT TO HAVE THE CHARACTER OF CELESTIAL BODIES IF THEY ARE SEEN FLYING IN ALL DI RECTIONS AND CONSEQUENTLY HAVE A MOTION OF THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT OF THAT OF OUR GLOBE IF THEY PART WITH SUCH QUANTITIES OF AN ELASTIC FLUID A PHLOGISTIC MATTER AND PROBABLY AN ACID SURELY WE ARE NOT TO CONSIDER THEM AS INDIFFERENT TO US MUCH LESS AS FORTUI TOUS MASSES OR TRAINS OF TERRESTRIAL EXHALATIONS IN THE AETHEREAL REGIONS BUT RATHER AS BODIES OF A NOBLER ORI GIN POSSIBLY REVOLVING ABOUT SOME CENTER FORMED AND REGULATED BY THE CREATOR FOR WISE AND BENEFICENT PUR POSES EVEN WITH REGARD TO OUR ATMOSPHERE WHICH DURING THEIR COMBUSTION THEY MAY SUPPLY WITH SOME SUBTILE AND SALUTARY MATTER OR REMOVE FROM IT SUCH PARTS AS BEGIN TO BE SUPERFLUOUS OR NOXIOUS TO THE INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH SINCE THESE SHEETS WERE PRINTED OFF DR PRINGLE RECEIVED ANOTHER LET TER FROM SIR ROBERT PRINGLE ACQUAINTING HIM HE HAD NOT FOUND THAT PART OF HIS INTELLIGENCE HOLD GOOD OF THE SHIPMASTERS SEEING THE METEOR OF THE 26TH OF NOVEMBER 1758 IN THE BALTICK BUT UPON FURTHER INQUIRY HAD LEARNT THAT THOUGH THIS PERSON HAD OBSERVED AN APPEARANCE OF THE SAME KIND IN THOSE SEAS IT WAS NOT ON THE SAME DAY V O L LI N N DR274 DR PRINGLE THINKS IT LIKEWISE PROPER TO INFORM THE PUBLIC THAT SINCE HIS PAPER WAS PRINTED HE HAS RECEIVED TWO FURTHER ACCOUNTS OF THE METEOR ONE FROM MR PRINGLE SHERIFFDEPUTE OF THE SHIRE OF ROX BURGH THE OTHER FROM MR GARRET OF ISLANDBRIDGE NEAR DUBLIN MR PRINGLE SAYS  THAT HAVING SINCE HIS LAST LETTER DRAWN A MORE  ACCURATE MERIDIAN AT THE FARMERS HOUSE AT ANCRAM HE NOW FINDS  THAT THE SHEPHERDS HOUSE MENTIONED P 236 BEARS NEARLY S E BY  S FROM THE FARMERS DWELLING HOUSE THAT THE HILL WITH THE TREES  OVER WHICH THE METEOR SEEMED TO BREAK LAID DOWN IN FIG IV AS AT  92 30 W OF THE MERIDIAN REALLY BORE W BY N FROM THE  OBSERVER AND THAT THE BEARING OF THE LUMINOUS BODY AT THE POINT  OF ITS EXTINCTION WAS NEARLY W N

PATH OF THE METEOR AND FOUND THAT IN ELPHINSTONS MAP OF SCOTLAND THE INTERSECTION WAS A FEW MILES TO THE EASTWARD OF GLASGOW BUT IN KITCHINS MAP A LITTLE TO THE WESTWARD OF IT IN CONSEQUENCE OF THESE LAST OBSERVATIONS THE DOCTOR HAS FIXED THE POINT OF EXTINCTION TO THE ZENITH OF THAT CITY BUT AS GLASGOW LIES ABOUT 76 MILES TO THE SOUTH WARD OF FORT WILLIAM OVER WHICH THE METEOR IN THE PRECEDING PAPER WAS SUPPOSED TO DISAPPEAR THE FIRST COURSE OF THAT BODY IS REDUCED TO ABOUT 324 MILES IN THIRTEEN SECONDS OF TIME AND ITS VELOCITY THEREFORE TO ABOUT 25 MILES IN ONE SECOND MR PRINGLE HAS LIKEWISE ACQUAINTED THE DOCTOR  THAT THE FARMER ON SEEING THE ENGRAVING OF THE 4TH  FIGURE OF WHICH MR PRINGLE HAD RECEIVED A COPY HAD FOUND FAULT  WITH THE SIZE OF THE HEAD OF THE METEOR AS BEING TOO LARGE IN PRO  PORTION TO THE LENGTH OF THE WHOLE SINCE TO HIS IMAGINATION THE  DIAMETER OF THE HEAD DID NOT EXCEED 8 INCHES AND THAT THE TAIL SEEMED  TO BE ABOUT 3 OR 4 YARDS LONG MR GARRET ACQUAINTS DR PRINGLE  THAT SINCE HIS FIRST LETTER TO THE  DOCTOR EMANUEL MILLER AND HE HAVING COMMUNICATED THEIR OBSER  VATIONS TO MR WILLIAM GIBSON MATHEMATICIAN AT DUBLIN THAT  GENTLEMAN HAD COME TO ISLANDBRIDGE AND HAVING MADE A SURVEY  WITH HIS INSTRUMENTS FOUND THAT THE GREATEST ALTITUDE OF THE METEOR  WAS NO MORE THAN 12 DEGREES

PROFESSOR OF ASTRONOMY IN THE UNIVERSITV OF GLASGOW,I206924,333 XLIII OBSERVATIONS OF THE TRANSIT OF VENUS OVER THE SUN CONTAINED IN A LETTER TO THE REVEREND NEVIL MASKELYNE ASTRONOMER ROYAL FROM DR ALEXANDER WILSON PRO FESSOR OF ASTRONOMY IN THE UNIVERSITV OF GLASGOW COLLEGE GLASGOW SEPT 9 1769 S I R I SEND YOU NOW THE PARTICULARS OF MY OBSERVATION OF THE TRANSIT OF VENUS TOGETHER WITH THE OBSERVATIONS OF THOSE WHO ACTED IN CONCERT WITH ME I CHOSE FOR THE PLACE OF MY OB SERVATIONS A HOUSE AT SOME DISTANCE FROM OUR OBSER VATORY BUT IN SIGHT OF IT AND MORE FREE FROM THE SMOKE OF THE TOWN WHERE I HAD TWO GENTLEMEN TO ATTEND THE CLOCK AND MARK THE TIMES I CARRIED WITH ME TWO REFLECTORS OF MR SHORTS WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW THREE OTHER INSTRUMENTS WERE MADE USE OF AT THE OBSERVATORY THE FIRST WAS AN ACHROMATIC TUBE OF DOLLONDS 29 INCH FOCUS BY WHICH AN IMAGE OF THE SUN WAS FORMED OF ABOUT SIX INCHES DIAMETER ON A BOARD COVERED WITH PAPER THE TELESCOPE BEING MOUNTED UPON A FRAME BY WHICH IT COULD BE TURNED ABOUT AS THE SUN MOVED AND THE ROOM PROPERLY DARKENED THIS INSTRUMENT WAS MANAGED BY DR WILLIAMSON AND READ DEC 7 1769334 AND DR REID AT THE WEST WINDOW OF THE ROOM OF THE OBSERVATORY WHEREIN THE ASTRONOMICAL CLOCK STOOD THE OTHER TWO INSTRUMENTS WERE PLACED WITHOUT AT THE SOUTH AND NORTH WINDOWS OF THE SAME ROOM ONE BEING A REFRACTOR OF 13 FEET BY WHICH DR IRVINE OB SERVED THE OTHER A 12 INCH REFLECTOR OF SHORTS BY WHICH MY SON OBSERVED THESE TWO OBSERVERS LOOKED DIRECTLY AT THE SUN HAVING THEIR INSTRUMENTS ARMED WITH SMOKEGLASSES ANOTHER PERSON STOOD AT THE CLOCK AND COUNTED THE SECONDS BY COINCIDENT BEATS UPON A PIECE OF BOARD WHICH HE HELD IN HIS HAND FOR THAT PURPOSE AND WHO NAMED EVERY FIFTH SECOND SO THAT ALL THE OBSERVERS COULD HEAR HIM DISTINCTLY THE MOTION OF THE CLOCK MADE BY SHELTON WAS CARE FULLY ADJUSTED BY MANY TRANSITS OF THE SUN AND FIXED STARS OVER THE MERIDIAN BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THE DAY OF THE TRANSIT THE CLOCK BY WHICH MY OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE WAS ADJUSTED BY SHELTONS BY MEANS OF SIGNALS MADE EVERY HOUR FOR SOME HOURS BEFORE AND AFTER THE TRANSIT IT WAS APPREHENDED THAT THE SMOKE OF THE TOWN MIGHT HURT THE OBSERVATIONS AND TO PRE VENT THIS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AN ADVERTISEMENT WAS PUT IN THE NEWSPAPER BEGGING THE INHABITANTS IN CASES WHERE IT WOULD NOT BE VERY INCONVENIENT TO PUT OUT THEIR FIRES FROM THREE OCLOCK THAT AFTERNOON TILL SUNSETTING THE POLITENESS OF THE INHABITANTS OF GLAS GOW IN COMPLYING WITH THIS REQUEST WAS FAR GREATER THAN COULD WELL BE EXPECTED INSOMUCH THAT THERE WAS NOT A SPIRE OF SMOKE TO BE PERCEIVED IN THAT QUAR TER FROM WHICH THE OBSERVATIONS COULD BE INCOM MODED HAVING MADE THESE PREPARATIONS WE THOUGHT WE HAD NOTHING TO FEAR BUT THE CLOUDS AND INDEED THE WESTERN PART OF THE HEAVENS WAS COVERED WITH335 WITH THICK CLOUDS ALL THE AFTERNOON TILL A SHORT TIME BEFORE THE EXTERNAL CONTACT BUT THEY DROVE AWAY TOWARDS THE NORTH AND LEST THE SUN PERFECTLY BRIGHT EXCEPTING THAT NOW AND THEN A CLOUD PASSED OVER HIM BUT WE SOON FOUND THAT THE CONSTITUTION OF THE AIR WAS OTHERWISE UNFAVOURABLE TO OUR OBSERVATIONS THE IMAGE OF THE SUN ON THE WHITE BOARD MADE BY THE ACHROMATIC TELESCOPE WAS BRIGHT ENOUGH BUT THERE WAS A REMARKABLE UNDULATION IN THE LIMB WHICH COULD BE OWING TO NOTHING ELSE BUT THE STATE OF THE AIR THIS INCONVENIENCE WAS ALSO SENSIBLY FELT BOTH BY THE OTHER GENTLEMEN AND MYSELF BESIDES THE UNDULATION NOW MENTIONED IN THE LIMB OF THE SUN THERE WAS ALSO A CONSIDERABLE TREMOR ROUND THE PLANET VENUS WHEN SHE WAS SEEN UPON THE SUNS DISC AND IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS AN INDISTINCTNESS IN HER LIMB WHICH MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO MEASURE HER DIAMETER BY OUR OBJECT GLASS MICROMETER OR OTHER WISE AFTER THE CENTER OF VENUS HAD PASSED THE SUNS LIMB SHE APPEARED TO US NOT TO BE CIRCULAR BUT OBLONG THE LONGEST DIAMETER BEING THAT WHICH PASSED THROUGH THE SUNS CENTER AS THE INTERNAL CONTACT APPROACHED VENUS APPEARED TO US TO ADHERE TO THE SUNS LIMB BY A DARK PROTUBERANCE OR NECK BOTH THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF WHICH VARIED EVERY MOMENT BY A CONSTANT UNDULATION NEITHER DID THIS NECK BREAK OFF INSTANTANEOUSLY BUT CHANGED ITS COLOUR FROM BLACK TO A DUSKY BROWN TILL AT LAST THE INTERVAL BETWIXT VENUS AND THE SUNS LIMB APPEARED QUITE CLEAR EACH OF THE OBSERVERS WROTE DOWN HIS OBSER VATIONS ON THE SPOT I REDUCED THEM TOGETHER WITH MY OWN TO APPARENT TIME FROM THE OBSERVATIONS I HAD336 HAD MADE ON THE GOING OF THE CLOCK AND ARE AS FOLLOWS H   EXTERNAL CONTACT 6 54 314 VENUSS CENTER JUDGED TO BE ON THE LIMB 7 1 334 SUNS LIGHT APPEARED

BETWIXT VENUS AND THE LIMB VENUSS CENTER JUDGED TO BE ON THE LIMB 7 1 24 BY DR REID DR REID MARKED THE TIME WHEN HE CONCEIVED THE INTERNAL CONTACT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THE DARK PROTUBERANCE UPON VENUS HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY AND HER DISC REDUCED TO A CIRCLE VIZ 7H 10 24HE THINKS IT LIKEWISE PROPER TO MENTION THAT SEVERAL SE CONDS BEFORE THE TIME ABOVE SET DOWN AS THE TIME OF THE INTERNAL CONTACT HE SAW A SMALL DINT UPON THE SUNS LIMB WHICH HE TOOK TO BE THE EXTERNAL CONTACT THAT HE IMMEDIATELY MENTIONED THIS TO DR WILLIAM SON WHO HAPPENED THAT INSTANT TO HAVE HIS EYES TURNED ANOTHER WAY BUT BEFORE HE COULD LOOK AT IT IT DISAPPEARED BY THE UNDULATION IN THE SUNS LIMB DR REID IS THE MORE PERSUADED THAT THIS WAS NOT MERE IMAGINATION BECAUSE THIS DINT ON THE LIMB OF THE SUN APPEARED TO HIM MUCH NEARER TO THE SUNS VERTICAL337 VERTICAL DIAMETER THAN HE EXPECTED IT BUT IN THE VERY POINT HOWEVER WHERE IT WAS CLEARLY SEEN IMME DIATELY AFTER H   P WILSON EXTERNAL CONTACT 6 54 28 INTERNAL CONTACT 7 12 24 MY SON DESIRES ME TO REMARK THAT HIS FIRST OBSER VATION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS NO OTHER BUT A POSTERIOR CONFIRMATION OF DR WILLIAMSONS AND DR REIDS EX TERNAL CONTACT THE FACT WAS THAT WHEN THESE GENTLE MEN PERCEIVED THE FIRST CONTACT THEIR KEENNESS MADE THEM CALL OUT AND IT WAS NOT TILL THEN THAT HE SAW THE PHAENOMENON WITH PERFECT CERTAINTY HE WAS CONSCIOUS HOWEVER THAT HE FLUCTUATED CONCERNING THE REALITY OF THE APPEARANCE FOR ABOUT TWELVE SECONDS BEFORE THAT TIME DURING WHICH HIS DETERMINATIONS WERE SUSPENDED THROUGH AN APPREHENSION OF ANTICI PATING THE REAL TIME WHICH WAS HEIGHTENED BY SO CLOSE A NEIGHBOURHOOD WITH THE OTHER OBSERVERS ALL OF WHOM HE COULD NOT HELP BEING SENSIBLE WERE STILL EX PECTING THE PHAENOMENON UPON THE WHOLE HE IS RATHER OF OPINION THAT HE WOULD HAVE PUT DOWN THE EXTERNAL CONTACT AT LEAST EIGHT SECONDS SOONER HAD HE BEEN OBSERVING APART HIS SECOND OBSERVATION BY WHICH HE MEANS THE INSTANT WHEN THE INTERVAL BE TWEEN VENUS AND THE SUNS LIMB FIRST APPEARED OB VIOUS WAS TAKEN DOWN WITHOUT THE LEAST KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT WAS PASSING AMONG THE OTHER GENTLEMEN WHO OBSERVED DR IRVINE HAS BEEN OUT OF TOWN FOR SOME CONSIDERABLE TIME PAST AND FORGOT TO LODGE HIS OBSER VATIONS WITH ME BUT I REMEMBER CERTAINLY THAT HE MADE THE EXTERNAL CONTACT THREE SECONDS SOONER THAN THE REST BUT HIS INTERNAL CONTACT WAS SOME SECONDS VOL LIX X X LATER338 LATER BUT HOW MANY I DO NOT NOW REMEMBER MR ANDERSON F R S FITTED UP A CLOCK AND APPA RATUS IN THE COLLEGE STEEPLE HIS CLOCK WAS REGULATED AS ABOVE BY SIGNALS FROM THE OBSERVATORY HE OB SERVED THE TRANSIT WITH A LARGE REFLECTOR AND HIS ASSIST ANTS OBSERVED WITH REFRACTORS THEY WERE ALL OF THEM UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE EXTERNAL CONTACT OWING TO THE STATE OF THE ATMOSPHERE AND A TREMOR GIVEN TO THE STEEPLE BY THE WIND BUT NONE OF THEIR OTHER OBSER VATIONS VARIED ABOVE THREE SECONDS FROM MY OWN AS RELATED ABOVE 0   LATITUDE OF THE OBSERVATORY 55 51 32 LONGITUDE BY CORRESPONDING OBSERVATIONS 0 17

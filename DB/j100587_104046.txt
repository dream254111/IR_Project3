COLLEGE OXFORD JULY 24 1734 S I R T H E MAN WHO WAS LATELY BITTEN BY A VIPER IN THE PRESENCE OF YOURSELF AND SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY HAVING BEEN RECOMMENDED TO SOME IN THIS PLACE BY DR OLIVER OF THE BATH I IMAGIND THAT SIR HANS SLOANE AND YOU WILL BE PLEASED WITH AN ACCOUNT OF SUCH EXPERIMENTS AS HAVE BEEN MADE HERE JULY 3D THE MAN WAS BIT IN THE PRESENCE OF SEVERAL BESIDES MYSELF IN THE PUBLIC HALL OF THIS COLLEGE HE RECEIVED TWO PUNCTURES IN THE WRIST A LITTLE ABOVE THE THUMB THE BLOOD ISSUED AND MORE VENOM LAY UP ON395 ON THE ORIFICES THAN COULD BE IMMEDIATELY IMBIBED THE MAN COMPLAIND IN ABOUT HALF AN HOURS TIME THAT THE POISON WAS GOT UP TO HIS SHOULDER AND ENTERING HIS BODY BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THIS WEDID NOT SUFFER HIM TO APPLY HIS MEDICINE SALLADOIL TILL AN HOUR AND 10 MINUTES AFTER HE WAS BITTEN BY WHICH TIME HE BEGAN TO BE FLUSHD AND IN A SWEAT HIS HAND SWOLN AND DIS COLOURD UPON AN APPLICATION OF HIS MEDICINE HE FOUND SOME ABATEMENT OF HIS PAIN BUT THE SWELLING APPEARD MORE VISIBLE AND SPREAD ITSELF FARTHER INTO HIS ARM IN ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR THE MAN SUNK UNDER THE TABLE AND COMPLAIND OF VIOLENT PAINS IN HIS BACK AND BOWELS NOR COULD HE BEAR TO BE MOVED AT LAST HIS PULSE FAILING HIS JAW BEING FALLEN HIS COUNTENANCE CHANGED AND EYES FIXD WE STRETCHD HIM UPON THE TABLE AND APPLIED THE MEDICINE TO HIS BELLY AND STOMACH SOON AFTER WHICH RECOVERING A LITTLE HE BEGAN TO VOMIT AND BROUGHT UP MORE THAN A QUART OF PHLEGM AND BILE IN THIS CONDITION HE LAY FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR AND THEN WAS REMOVD INTO MY LODGINGS WHERE HE WAS SEIZED AGAIN WITH A FIT OF VOMITING AND LIKEWISE PURGING AND CONTINUED SO TILL MIDNIGHT I KEPT HIM IN MY OWN HOUSE ABOVE AN HOUR IN HOPES OF HIS GROWING BETTER BUT HIS DIS ORDER STILL CONTINUING AND THE MAN BEING TOO WEAK AND FEEBLE EVEN TO STAND I SENT HIM IN A CHAIR HOME TO HIS OWN LODGINGS WHERE HE WAS PUT INTO BED AND AFTER MIDNIGHT FELL ASLEEP AND AWAKED THE NEXT MORN ING PERFECTLY WELL EXCEPTING THAT HIS ARM WAS STILL SWOLN AND THE FLESH PITTED AS IF IT HAD BEEN DROPSICAL HIS ARM WAS BOUND UP IN PAPERS DIPT IN HIS OWN MEDICINE AND THIS WAS ALL AS FAR AS I COULD OBSERVE OR LEARN THAT WAS APPLIED TO IT THE SAME DAY WE E E E 2 CAUSED396 CAUSED TWO YOUNG CHICKENS TO BE BIT ONE DIED IN TWO HOURS AND THE OTHER IN FOUR HOURS TIME A THIRD WAS BIT THREE TIMES AND THEN HAD THE MEDI CINE APPLIED BUT IT DIED AT THE END OF TEN HOURS THE FLESH OF THIS LAST WAS GROWN VERY BLACK AND THERE WAS MUCH EXTRAVASATED LYMPH BETWEEN IT AND THE SKIN WHICH STUNK INSUFFERABLY BUT I COULD NOT PERCEIVE THAT THE VISCERA WERE AT ALL DISCOLOURD JULY 4TH WE HAD ANOTHER FOWL HALF GROWN BIT IN TWO PLACES AND THE MEDICINE WAS APPLIED HALF AN HOUR AFTER WHICH THE FOWL EAT MEAT AND SEEMD MUCH RECOVERD BUT WAS DEAD IN FOURTEEN HOURS TIME JULY 6TH WE CAUSED TWO HALFGROWN COCKS TO BE BIT THE FIRST WAS BIT BUT ONCE YET VIOLENTLY AND TURNED BLACK IMMEDIATELY IT HAD THE MEDICINE APPLIED EAT MEAT AFTERWARDS AND SEEMD PRETTY WELL YET DIED IN TWENTY HOURS THE OTHER WAS BIT TWO OR THREE TIMES BUT HARDLY WOUNDED AND NOT HALF SO MUCH DISCOLOURD AS THE FORMER WE BATHED THE WOUND WITH VIPEROIL BUT THE FOWL DIED IN A LITTLE MORE THAN TWO HOURS JULY 8TH WE CAUSED TWO YOUNG PIDGEONS TO BE BIT THE ONE HAD VIPEROIL AP PLIED IMMEDIATELY BUT SICKEND AND DIED IN FOUR HOURS THE OTHER HAD OLIVEOIL APPLIED AND RE COVERD PERFECTLY THE FLESH BEGINNING TO RETURN TO ITS NATURAL COLOUR IN ABOUT AN HOURS TIME JULY 17TH THE WOMAN WAS BIT IN THE PUBLICK HALL OF BRAZENNOSECOLLEGE IN PRESENCE OF DR FRAMPTON DR FREWIN AND SEVERAL OTHER PHYSICIANS MYSELF AND MANY OTHERS IT HAD BEEN SUSPECTED THAT THEY PLAYD SOME TRICKS WITH THEIR VIPERS AND MADE THEM SPEND THEIR RAGE AND VENOM BEFOREHAND TO OBVIATE WHICH A PHYSICIAN OF THE COMPANY HAD PRO VIDED397 VIDED SOME FRESH VIPERS WHICH HE HAD CAUGHT HIM SELF A DAY OR TWO BEFORE AND KEPT IN HIS OWN CUSTODY TILL THAT TIME THE WOMAN WAS BIT TWICE BY ONE OF THESE AND RECEIVED THREE WOUNDS ONE IN THE THUMB AND TWO IN THE FOREFINGER HER HAND WAS SOON SWOLN AND SPOTTED AND HER FINGER TURND BLACK AFTER THREE AND TWENTY MINUTES SHE APPLIED THE MEDICINE TO HER HAND BUT NOT FARTHER THAN THE SWELLING WENT IN WHICH I THINK SHE WAS TO BE BLAMED AND I SUSPECT THE FOLLOWING ILLNESS WAS IN SOME MEASURE OCCASIOND BY IT SHE WALKD HOME VERY WELL IN APPEARANCE BUT ABOUT THREE HOURS AFTER THE BITE WAS RECEIVED SHE GREW VERY SICK AND IN GREAT PAIN WAS SEIZD WITH VOMITING PURGING AND FAINTINGFITS WHICH CONTINUED UPON HER ALL NIGHT INSOMUCH THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE HOUSE DESPAIRD OF HER LIFE NOR HAD SHE ANY SLEEP TILL NOON THE DAY FOLLOWING I SAW HER ABOUT SIX THAT EVENING WHEN SHE AWAKD AND FOUND HER VERY WELL IN SPIRITS BUT COMPLAINING OF MOST ACUTE PAINS IN HER FINGER HER ARM SHOULDER BACK AND BREAST ON THAT SIDE WERE MUCH SWOLN AND INFLAMD ALL THOSE PARTS THUS AFFECTED WERE BOUND UP IN PAPERS SOAKD IN THE MEDICINE AFTER THIS THERE APPEARD UP ON HER FINGER TWO LARGE BLADDERS FULL OF A BLACK COR RUPT MATTER AND THIS NOT ONLY UPON THE WOUND BUT ONE OF THEM WAS UPON A DISTANT PART OF THE FINGER FROM IT SHE COULD NOT BE PERSUADED TO OPEN THEM WHICH I BELIEVE WOULD HAVE EASED HER CONSIDERABLY JULY 20TH THE SWELLING WAS CONSIDERABLY ABATED AND ALMOST REDUCED INTIRELY INTO HER HAND WHICH BE GUN TO PIT BUT SHE COMPLAIND STILL OF HER FINGER AND COULD HARDLY ENDURE TO HAVE IT DRESSD WITH FRESH PAPERS SHE CONTINUED IN BED TILL THE 22D FOR THE SAKE398 SAKE OF KEEPING HER HAND IN A MORE EASY POSTURE AND THEN CAME ABROAD THE SAME DAY THAT THE WOMAN WAS BIT WE CAUSED A FOWL TO BE BIT BUT THE WOUND WAS NOT DEEP AND LITTLE MORE THAN A SCRATCH NO THING WAS APPLIED TO IT AND IT DIED IN TWENTY HOURS A LARGE PUPPY WAS BIT THE SAME DAY THREE TIMES IN THE HEAD HAD THE MEDICINE APPLIED BUT DIED IN ABOUT AN AN HOUR IT WAS KNOWN THAT THESE PEOPLE KEPT THEM SELVES FASTING THOSE DAYS WHEN THE EXPERIMENT WAS TO BE TRIED UPON THEM THIS OCCASIOND A SUSPICION THAT THEY MIGHT TAKE SOME ANTIDOTE TO PREPARE THEIR BO DIES FOR WHICH REASON I ORDERD THE MAN TO BRING ME SOME VIPERS AFTER DINNER LAST MONDAY UNDER PRE TENCE OF MAKING SOME FARTHER EXPERIMENTS UPON DOGS WE HAD PROVIDED AT THE SAME TIME SOME FRESH VIPERS WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE AND THEN PROPOSED TO HIM TO BE BIT BY ONE OF THEM AND APPLY HIS MEDICINE IMME DIATELY HIS HAND WAS BESMEARD WITH THE MEDICINE IN APPLYING IT TO A YOUNG DOG UPON WHICH WE HAD JUST MADE AN EXPERIMENT TWO VIPERS WERE TRIED UPON THE MAN BUT NEITHER WOULD BITE HIM ONE OF THEM ATTEMPTED IT SEVERAL TIMES AND SPILT HIS VENOM BUT ALWAYS CAUGHT BACK HIS HEAD AGAIN AS IF THERE HAD BEEN SOMETHING IN THE HAND OFFENSIVE UPON THIS SUSPECTING THAT THE SMELL OF THE MEDICINE MIGHT OCCA SION IT WE MADE HIM WASH HIS HAND AFTER WHICH AN OTHER VIPER BIT HIM IMMEDIATELY BUT WHETHER OUR CONJECTURE WAS RIGHT OR NOT MUST DEPEND UPON FAR THER TRIAL THE MAN RECEIVED THE BITE UPON THE JOINT OF THE THUMB AND THE BLOOD ISSUED AT THE TWO ORI FICES HE APPLIED THE MEDICINE INSTANTLY THE THUMB APPEARD BLACK SOON THE HAND WAS SWOLN AND THE FLESH PITTED INSTANTLY HE DRANK A MUG OF ALE AFTER IT399 IT AND THEN WENT HOME TO BED YESTERDAY MORNING HIS WHOLE ARM WAS SWOLN BUT THE MAN WAS SO WELL THAT HE WENT SIX MILES OUT OF TOWN AND CAME HOME AGAIN IN THE EVENING I HAVE SEEN HIM AGAIN THIS MORNING THE SWELLING IS ALMOST GONE ABOVE THE EL BOW BUT THE FLESH PITS BELOW THE WOUND HAS BLI STERD BUT THE BLADDERS WERE FILLED WITH A WATER AND NOT ANY THING OF THAT BLACK MATTER WHICH APPEARD UPON THE WOMANS FINGER WE CAUSED A YOUNG DOG MENTIOND BEFORE TO BE BIT THE SAME DAY AND AP PLIED THE MEDICINE ANOTHER DOG WAS BIT THREE TIMES IN THE NOSE AND NOTHING APPLIED BOTH ARE MUCH SWOLN BUT VERY LIKELY TO LIVE WE LIKEWISE THRUST THE TEETH OF A VIPERS HEAD CUT OFF TWENTYFOUR HOURS BE FORE INTO THE FLESH OF A FOWL WHICH TURND BLACK IM MEDIATELY BUT THE FOWL IS PERFECTLY RECOVERD WITHOUT ANY APPLICATION I LEAVE YOU SIR TO MAKE YOUR OWN REFLECTIONS UP ON THESE EXPERIMENTS AND SHALL ONLY ADD THAT I WOULD BY NO MEANS ENCOURAGE THE MAN TO GO ON WITH THEM SINCE THEY MUST AT LEAST OCCASION HIM MUCH PAIN AND MISERY MORE THAN THE GAINS ARE WORTH AND PERHAPS INJURE HIS CONSTITUTION LIKEWISE IT IS RATHER TO BE WISHED THAT HE COULD OBTAIN SOME RE WARD AND MAKE THE MEDICINE PUBLIC IN WHICH CASE THERE WOULD PROBABLY BE UNFORTUNATE PERSONS ENOUGH IN THE COUNTRY WHO WOULD HAVE OCCASION TO TRY IT WITHOUT TORTURING THEMSELVES DESIGNEDLY I AM S I R YOUR VERY HUMBLE SERVANT JO ATWELL VIII AN

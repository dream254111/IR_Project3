AMONGST MY ADVERSARIA SOME OBSERVATIONSTHAT I THOUGHT MIGHT NOT BE UNACCEPTABLE TO YOU NOR IMPERTINENT TO YOUR DESIGN OF MAKING COLLECTIONS FOR THE HISTORY OF NATURE I HAVE HERE SENT YOU A FEW OF SUCH AS MY OTHER OCCASIONS WOULD AT PRESENT AFFORD ME LEISURE TO RECOLLECT THIS ENSUING NARRATIVE CONCER NING THE STRANGE EFFECT OF THUNDER UPON A MAGNETICK SEACARD I HAD FROM ONE MR HAWARD THAT WAS MASTER OF SEVERAL SHIPS AND A MAN OF GOOD CREDIT P P P P HE648 HE TELLS ME THAT BEING ONCE MASTER OF A SHIP IN A VOYAGE TO BAR BADOS IN COMPANY OF ANOTHER COMMANDED BY ONE GROFTON OF NEWENGLAND THEY WERE IN THE LATITUDE AS I REMEMBER OF BERMUDA SUDDENLY ALARMED WITH A TERRIBLE CLAP OF THUNDER WHICH BROKE THIS GROFTONS FOREMAST TORE HIS SAYLES AND DID SOME DAMAGE TO HIS RIGGING BUT BY THAT TIME THE NOYSE TOGETHER WITH THE DANGER OF THIS FRIGHTFUL ACCIDENT WAS PAST MR HAWARD TO WHOME THIS THUNDER HAD BEEN MORE FAVORABLE WAS HOWEVER NO LESS SURPRISED TO SEE HIS COMPANIONS SHIP STEER DIRECTLY HOME WARD AGAIN AT FIRST HE THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS THE CONFUSION THAT THE LATE MISCHANCE HAD PUT THEM IN MIGHT HAVE MADE THEM MISTAKE THEIR COURSE AND THAT THEY WOULD SOON PERCEIVE THEIR ERROR BUT SEEING THEM PERSIST IN IT AND BEING BY THIS TIME ALMOST OUT OF CALL HE TACKT AND STOOD AFTER THEM AND AS SOON AS HE GOT NEAR ENOUGH TO BE WELL UNDERSTOOD ASKED WHERE THEY WERE GOING BUT BY THEIR ANSWER WHICH IMPORTED THAT THEY HAD NO OTHER DESIGN THAN THE PROSECUTION OF THEIR FORMER INTENDED VOYAGE AND BY THE SEQUEL OF THEIR DISCOURSE IT AT LAST APPEARED THAT MR GROFTON DID INDEED STEER BY THE RIGHT POINT OF HIS COMPASS BUT THAT THE CARD WAS TURNED ROUND THE NORTH AND SOUTH POINTS HAVING CHANGED POSITIONS AND THOUGH WITH HIS FINGER HE BROUGHT THE FLOW ERDELYS TO POINT DIRECTLY NORTH IT WOULD IMMEDIATLY AS SOON AS AT LIBERTY RETURN TO THIS NEW UNUSUAL POSTURE AND UPON EXAMI NATION HE FOUND EVERY COMPASS IN THE SHIP OF THE SAME HUMOR WHICH STRANGE AND SUDDEN ACCIDENT HE COULD IMPUTE TO NOTHING ELSE BUT THE OPERATION OF THE LIGHTNING OR THUNDER NEWLY MENTIONED HE ADDS THAT HE LENT GROFTON ONE OF HIS COMPASSES TO FINISH THE VOY AGE AND WITHALL THAT THOSE THUNDERSTRUCKEN ONES DID NEVER TO HIS KNOWLEDG RECOVER THEIR RIGHT POSITIONS AGAIN AND THAT HE BE LEIVES IF MRGROSTON BE LIVING HE HATH ONE OF THEM TO THIS DAY THAT IN AMERICA AT LEAST AS FAR AS THE ENGLISH PLANTATIONS ARE EXTENDED THERE IS AN EXTRAORDINARY ALTERATION AS TO TEMPERATURE SINCE THE EUROPEANS BEGAN TO PLANT THERE FIRST IS THE IOYNT ASSERTION OF THEM ALL NEITHER HATH IT NEAR SO MANY ADMIRERS AS WITNESSES IN REGARD THAT THIS CHANGE OF TEMPERATURE IS AND NOT WITHOUT SOME REASON GENERALLY ATTRIBUTED TO THE CUTTING DOWN OF VAST WOODS TOGETHER WITH THE CLEARING AND CULTIVATING OF THE COUNTRY BUT THAT IRELAND SHOULD ALSO CONSIDERABLY ALTER WITHOUT ANY SUCH MANI FEST CAUSE DOTH CERTAINLY EITHER INVALIDATE THE REASON GENERALLY ADMITTED FOR THE ALTERATION OF AMERICA NEWLY MENTIONED OR ELS EVINCE THAT QUITE DIFFERENT CAUSES MAY PRODUCE THE SAME EFFECT FOR649 FOR IF IT BE TRUE AS SOME COMPUTE THAT THIS KINGDOM WAS BETTER IN HABITED AND HUSBANDED BEFORE THE LATE BLOODY WAR THAN AT PRE SENT IT SHOULD ACCORDING TO THE REASONS ALLEDGED FOR THE CHANGE OF TEMPERATURE IN AMERICA BE RATHER GROWN MORE INTEMPERATE VIZ FOR WANT OF CULTIVATION BUT THE CONTRARY IS OBSERVABLE HERE AND EVERY ONE ALMOST BEGINS TO TAKE NOTICE THAT THIS COUNTRY BECOMES EVERY YEAR MORE AND MORE TEMPERATE NOW WHETHER THERE WERE MORE INHABITANTS IN IRELAND BEFORE THE LATE WAR THAN AT PRESENT I SHALL NOT HERE INSIST UPON NEITHER DO I THINK IT AN EASY MATTER TO DETERMINE YET SURE I AM THAT THERE HATH BEEN NO SUCH INCREASE OF PEOPLE HERE WITHIN THESE 16 OR 20 YEARS NOR SUCH IMPROVE MENTS AS TO BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE GREAT CHANGE OF TEMPERATURE THAT IS OF LATE OBSERVED WITHIN LESS THAN THE TIME NEWLY MENTIO NED TWAS NOT UNUSUAL TO HAVE FROST AND DEEP SNOWES OF A FORTNIGHT OR THREE WEEKS CONTINUANCE AND THAT TWICE OR THRICE SOMETIMES OFTNER IN A WINTER NAY WE HAVE HAD GREAT RIVERS AND LAKES FROZEN ALL OVER WHEREAS OF LATE ESPECIALLY THESE TWO OR THREE YEARS LAST PAST WE HAVE HAD SCARCE ANY FROST OR SNOW AT ALL NEITHER CAN I IMPUTE THIS EXTRAORDINARY ALTERATION TO ANY FORTUITOUS CONCOURSE OF ORDI NARY CIRCUMSTANCES REQUISIT TO THE PRODUCTION OF FAIR WEATHER BE CAUSE IT IS MANIFEST THAT IT HATH PROCEEDED GRADUALLY EVERY YEAR BECOMING MORE TEMPERATE THAN THE YEAR PRECEDING IF ANY IN THIS CITY OR COUNTRY HATH KEPT AN EXACT ACCOUNT OF THE WEATHER FOR AT LEAST A DOZEN OR FOURTEEN YEARS PAST I DOUBT NOT BUT THEIR IOURNALLS WILL VERIFY WHAT I HAVE ONLY IN GENERAL OBSERVED AND THUS FAR INSISTED UPON FOR MY OWN PART I WAS NEVER FURNISHED WITH LEISURE NOR CONVENIENCES BEFORE THIS YEAR TO MAKE ANY OBSERVA TIONS IN PARTICULAR OF THIS KIND MY OCCASIONS BEING SUCH AS REQUI RED A REMOVAL FROM PLACE TO PLACE AND FOR SOME TIME TO THE WEST INDIES AS FOR THE LAST YEAR I CAN ONLY TELL YOU IN GENERALL THAT ALL THE WINTER WAS VERY MILD AND WARMER THAN COULD BE WELL EX PECTED FROM SUCH A SEASON AND BUT VERY LITTLE RAIN HAVING IN THE WHOLE MONTH OF FEBRUARY NOT RAINED ABOVE TWICE OR THRICE AT LEAST IN THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY WHERE I WAS THEN INSOMUCH THAT MANY TOOK UPON THEM TO PREDICT THAT SUCH UNSEASONABLE WEATHER WOULD CERTAINLY BE THE CAUSE OF SOME DEARTH OR PESTILENCE FOR ALL EXTRAOR DINARY APPEARANCES OF WEATHER METEORS C ACCORDING TO THE VULGAR MUST NEEDS BE PRESAGERS OF MISCHIEF THE ENSUING SUMMER OR AUTUMN BUT THEIR PREDICTIONS PROVED AS FALSE AS THE  HARVEST WAS EXTRAORDINARY BOTH FOR HEALTH AND PLENTY THIS LAST WINTER NOW NEWLY ENDED I HAVE KEPT AN EXACT AC COUNT OF WIND AND WEATHER AS I INTEND TO DOE GODWILLING P P P P 2 FOR650 FOR THE FUTURE BEING WELL PROVIDED WITH A BAROMETER SEALED THERMOMETERS HYGROSCOPES AND ALL THINGS REQUISIT TO THE PERFOR MANCE OF SO NICE AND NECESSARY A TASK TO TRANSCRIBE MY LOURNALL HERE WOULD BE TOO TEDIOUS AND NEEDLESS UNTILL I HAVE MADE FAR THER OBSERVATIONS LET IT SUFFICE THEREFORE TO TELL YOU THAT IT HATH BEEN A VERY FAIR AND WARM OR RATHER NO WINTER AT ALL THAT WE HAVE NOT HAD ABOVE FIVE OR SIX FROSTY MORNINGS THIS WINTER AND NONE THAT LASTED LONGER THAN TILL NOONTHAT WE HAD SNOW BUT THRICE THE FIRST BEFORECHRISTMASS THE SECOND UPON THE 11THAND THIRD UPON THE 17TH OF JANUARY THIS LAST WHICH WAS THE LONGEST SNOW WE HAD THIS WINTER CONTINUED NOT 48 HOURS BUT THAWED ALL THIS WINTER WE NEVER HAD TWO DAIES OF RAIN TOGETHER NOR ABOVE TWO OR THREE THAT COULD WELL BE CALLED RAINY DAIESMARCH 14THWE HAD A SHOWER OF RAIN AND HAIL TOGETHER THE WIND BEING S W AND CALM THE MER CURY IN MY BAROMETER WHICH IS VERY SLENDER BUT CAREFULLY FILLED AND CONVENIENTLY PLACED IS FOR THE MOST PART ABOUT 29 INCHES HIGH ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE STAGNANT QUICKSILVER BUT YET DOTH VERY SENSIBLY AND FREQUENTLY VARY ITS HEIGHT ACCORDING TO THE DIFFE RENCE OF THE ATMOS GRAVITY JANUARY 17TH WHICH WAS THE DAY IT LAST SNOWED HERE THE  WAS SUBSIDED TO 28 INCHES THE NEXT DAY IT WAS AT 28 BEING TO WARDS NIGHT SOMEWHAT BLUSTERINGAND THE SNOW THAWED JAN 19TH BEING FAIR BUT VERY FOGGY THE WAS AT 28 WHICH IS THE LOWEST STATION IT WAS EVER AT YET WITH ME THE WIND WAS WESTERLY AND CLAM THE NEXT DAY IT WAS UP AGAIN TO 29 AND AFTER WARDS HIGHER FEB 15TH IN THE MORNING BEING CLOUDY THE WIND WESTERLY AND BLUSTERING THE WAS AT 29 AND ABOUT 11 THAT NIGHT BEING FAIR CLEAR AND CLAM IT WAS RISEN TO 30 INCHES THE NEXT DAY BEING STILL FAIR AND CLAM IT WAS AT 30 INCHES WHICH IS THE UTMOST HEIGHT I HAVE YET SEEN IT AT NEXT DAY IT FELL A LITTLE BENEATH 30 AND KEPT AS BEFORE FOR THE MOST PART ABOUT 29 OR  TO THIS PRESENT ONLY ON THE 11TH OF MARCH IT WAS AT 30 AGAIN THOUGH IT BE OBSERVED THAT FROSTY AND SNOWY WINTERS MAKE EARLY SPRINGS AND FOR AS LITTLE AS WE HAVE HAD OF EITHER THIS WINTER YET THERE HATH NOT WITHIN THE MEMORY OF ANY NOW LIVING HAPPENED A FORWARDER SPRING IN IRELAND SINCE THIS PLACE COULD PRODUCE SOME STORE OF RIPE CHERRIES IN THE MIDST OF APRIL THE WIND KEEPS FOR THE MOST PART HERE BETWEEN THE NORTHWEST AND THE SOUTH SELDOM AT EAST AND YET SELDOMER AT NORTH OR NORTHEAST INSOMUCH THAT MANY HERE DONT SCRUPLE TO AFFIRM THAT FOR AT LEAST OF THE YEAR THE WIND IS WESTERLY AND WE HAVE SOMETIMES KNOWN PASSENGERS WAIT AT CHESTER  HOLY HEAD NOLESS THAN THREE MONTHS FOR A FAIR WIND TO COME HITHER THE HYGROSCOPE I MAKE USE OF I THUS CONTRIVED I TOOK TWO PIECES651 PIECES OF DEAL BOARD POPLAR WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER EACH ABOUT TWO FOOT LONGAND A FOOT OR MORE IN BREADTH AB THESE I GOT WELL PLAINED AND SHOTTEN THAT THEIR EDGES MIGHT MEET EVEN TOGETHER OF THESE TWO SET EDGE BY EDGE I FASTENED EACH END BETWEEN TWO LEDGES OF OAK CCOF TWO INCH ES BROAD AND LONG ENOUGH TO REACH ATHWART BOTH BOARDS BUT ONE LEDGE IF IT BE THICK ENOUGH MIGHT BE MADE TO SERVE EACH END BY MAKING HOLLOW FURROWS OR GUTTERS IN IT TO RECEIVE THE ENDS OF THE BOARDSAND SO I FIXED BOTH BOARDS INAS PANNELS ARE SET IN WAINSCOT THIS DONE SUPPOSING OF AN INCH TO BE THE UTMOST DISTANCE THAT THESE TWO BOARDS WOULD SHRINK ASUNDER IN DRIEST WEATHER FOR IT MATTERED NOT MUCH THOUGH IT SHOULD BE SOMEWHAT MORE OR LESS I TOOK A THIN PIECE OF BRASSDOF TWO OR THREE INCHES LONG AND  INCH BROAD AND UPON ONE EDGE TOWARDS THE END I MEASURD OF AN INCH WHICH WAS THE UTMOST DISTANCE I SUPPOSED THE TWO BOARDS WOULD GAPE ASSUNDER WHICH SPACE DD I DIVIDED INTO FIVE EQUAL PARTS AND WITH A SMALL FILE MADE THEM INTO SO MANY FINE TEETH LIKE THOSE OF A WATCHWHEEL THIS PIECE OF BRASS I PLACD FLAT ACROSS THE IUNCTURE OF THE TWO BOARDSNAYLING ITS ONE END BY MEANS OF TWO SMALL HOLES BB TO THE BOARD A ONLY AND LEAVING THE OTHER END WHICH IS THE TOOTHED ONE FREEAND REACHING TO A COMPETENT DISTANCE OVER THE BOARD B TO WHICH IT HAD NO COHERENCE NEXT I MADE A PINION CONSISTING OF AS MANY TEETH AS THE BRASS HAD E UPON THE END OF A PIECE OF THICK IRON WIRE THIS AXEL F WITH ITS PINION E I SO FASTNED TO THE OTHER BOARD B BY MEANS OF THE BRACHIOLUM E AND SO ADAPTED TO THE TEETH OF THE BRASS PLATE THAT WHEN THE BOARDS DO SHRINK ASSUNDER THE BRASS BEING DRAWN A LITTLE AWAY MUST NEEDS TURN THIS AXEL BY MEANS OF ITS TOOTHED PINION MORE OR LESS AND SO IF EVER IT HAPPENS THAT THE BOARDS GAPE BUT A QUARTER OF AN INCH ASSUNDER THIS AXEL WILL HAVE MADE ONE INTIRE REVOLUTION WHEREFORE I PUT A LONG INDEX GG UPON THE EXTREMITY OF THIS AXELAND MADE A CIRCLE ROUND IT WITH THE USUAL GRADUATIONS NUM BERED FROM WHAT POINT I PLEASEDAND THE MOTION OF THE INDEX BACK OR FORWARD SHEWS ME THE DEGREES OF THE DROUGHT OR MOISTURE OF THE AYR NOW THIS AXEL MAY BE MADE TO COME THROUGH A ROUND PLATE OF WOOD OR METTLE THAT HIDES THE CONTRIVANCE ALL BUT THE HAND AND FIGURES AS IN A CLOCK OR WATCH TIS TO BE HOTED MORE OVER THAT THE BOARDS MUST BE FASTNED TO THE LEDGES ONLY AT THE OUTER EDG ESAS AT AAAA THAT THEY MAY HAVE THE MORE LIBERTY OF SWELLING AND SHRINKING ASSUNDER THE COMMODIOUSNESS OF THIS KIND OF HYGROSCOPE IN COMPARISON OF THOSE MADE OF WILD OATBEARDS MAY BEST BE OBSER VED TAB 1 FIG 1652 VED BY THOSE THAT ARE FURNISHED WITH BOTH AND THEREFORE I SHALL ONLY ADD THAT IF ANY ONE ELSE HATH MADE USE OR THOUGHT OF THE LIKE CON TRIVANCE IT IS MORE THAN I KNOW AND WITHALL THAT THOUGH THE ONE I MAKE USE OF AT PRESENT BE NONE OF THE BEST WORKMANSHIP NOR EXACTLY MADE AFTER THE DESCRIPTION I HAVE HERE GIVEN YOUTHE BOARDS HAVING NOT LIBERTY OF GAPING ABOVE  OF AN INCH YET I HAVE OFTENTIMES THE PLEASURE OF SEEING THE INDEX TURN NO LESS THAN 10 SOMETIMES 20 DE GREESIN AN HOUR OR TWO AND WHEN THE AYR IS CHANGED WILL RETURN AS SWIFTLY BY THE SHRINKING AND SWELLING OF THE BOARDS I HAVE HERE WITHAL SENT YOU THE FIGURE OF AN ADMIRABLE INSTANCE OF NATURES LUXURIANCY IN HER CONTRIVANCE EVEN OF INSECTS TIS A KIND OF LARGE FLYING BEETLE OF A DARK SHINING BROWN WITH A HUGE PAIR OF HORNS IN PROPORTION TO THE BODY SHAPED AND BRANCHED EXACTLY LIKE A STAGGS OR HARTSFROM WHICH LAST IT HATH ITS DENOMINATION OUR PEOPLE IN VIRGINIA AND NEW ENG LAND CALLING IT A FLYING HART IT FLIES HIGH AND SWIFT AND RESTS MOST COMMONLY UPON BRANCHES OR TRUNKS OF STANDING TREES WHERE AS SOON AS IT HAS TAKEN UP ITS STATION IT BEGINS WITH A SHRILL CHIRPING VOICE WHICH IT RAISES BY LITTLE AND LITTLE TILL IT MAKE THE WHOLE WOODS RING AGAIN AND THEN LESSENS GRADUALLY TILL IT CEASETH WITH A KIND OF SILENT MURMUR AS IF THE LITTLE CREATURE HAD RUNG IT SELF ASLEEP THEN FLIES TO SOME OTHER PLACE AND BEGINS THE SAME TUNE AGAIN THOUGH I HAVE SEEN AND HEARD MANY OF THEMYET I NEVER HAD THE FOR TUNE TO LIGHT UPON ANY OF THEM DEAD OR ALIVE BUT ONE WHICH NOT WITHSTANDING I LEFT IN VIRGINIABUT BY GOOD LUCK HAD FIRST DRAWN THE PICTURE OF IT ACCORDING TO THE COPY YOU HAVE HERE  WHICH REPRESENTS ITS SHAPE AND SIZE EXACTLY AS IT LAY UPON A BOOK BEFORE ME WHERE IT IS TO BE NOTED THAT THE HORNS ARE OF A SHINING HARD SUBSTANCE AND THAT THE TIPS OF THEM TOUCH THE SAME PLANE WITH THE BELLY I COULD WILLINGLY HAVE TAKEN SOME PAINS TO OBSERVE THE ANATOMY OF THESE PRETTY INSECTS AND THEIR MANNER OF BREEDING AND PROPAGATION BUT THE SEASON OF THE YEAR TOGETHER WITH MY EMPLOYMENT WERE BOTH UNFAVORABLE TO MY DESIRE AND I WAS THEREFORE FORCED TO DESIST WITHOUT FURTHER SATISFACTION TAB 1 FIG 2  SEE FIG 2 THOUGH THE AUTHOR IN NUMB27 OF YOUR TRANSACTIONS SEEMS IN CLINABLE TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS PECULIAR TO THE THAMESWATER ALONE UPON STRINKING TO BE RECOVERABLE OR POTABLE AGAIN I CAN AFFIRM UP ON MY OWN KNOWLEDGE THAT WATER TAKEN ABOARD AT NEW LONDON IN NEW ENGLAND THOUGH IN EIGHT DAYS TIME IT STUNK INTOLERABLY YET WHEN WE CAME TO VIRGINIA IT RECOVERED SO PERFECTLY THAT I MADE NO SCRUPLE TO DRINK OF IT IN HARBOUR EVEN WHEN WE HAD FRESH WATER NEWLY653 NEWLY BROUGHT FROM SHORE NOR COULD I EASILY PERCEIVE IT HAD ANY RELICKS OF ITS LATE CORRUPTION THAT THE TESTICLES OF THE ANIMAL CALLED MUSKQUASH DO SMELL STRONG OF MUSK AS MR JOSSELIN SAITH IS MOST CERTAIN FOR I HAVE KNOWN SOME OF THEM KEPT A LONG TIME IN ONES POCKET TILL THEY WERE BECOME HARD AND BLACK AND YET SMELT AS STRONGLY AS AT FIRST WHICH IN MY OPINION WAS NOTHING INFERIOUR TO THE SCENT OF THAT WHICH IS COMMONLY SOLD FOR MUSK IN THE SHOPS I REMEMBER THAT ONE OF OUR SEAMEN BEING LAID TO SLEEP TOO NEAR THE FIREPLACE WITH ONE OF THESE DRIED TESTICLES IN HIS POCKET IT HAPPEND THAT A COAL BURND THROUGH BREECHES AND ALL TO IT AND MADE SO GREAT A SCENT OF MUSK THAT HE MIGHT EASILY HAVE BEEN SMELT A GOOD WAY OFF AND THE FIRE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE ADVANCED WHERE THERE WAS A WORSE PERFUME HAD NOT THE STRENGTH OF THIS A WAKEND THE MAN AND SO MADE HIM WITHDRAW HIS BREECH IN TIME THIS ANIMAL DESERVES TO BE FURTHER INQUIRED INTO ESPECIALLY IF WHAT MR THEUENOT RELATES BE TRUE VIZ THAT MUSK IS NOTHING ELSE BUT THE TESTICLES OF A BEAST LIKE A DEER FOUND IN THE PROVINCE OF HONAN AS TIS NOTED IN NUMB 14 P 250 OF YOUR TRANSACTIONS

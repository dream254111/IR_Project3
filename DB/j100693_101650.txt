ab If Barrow e Soc Regia c Londini 1675 in 40 WHat moved the learned and worthy Author of this work to enrich the world with such an Edition of these three Anci ent Mathematicians the Reader will find in his general Preface to Archimedes What he hath performed in short is this He hath delivered these three Books in a brief Symbolical method of Ex pression pursuant to the Sense Propositions and Demonstrations of the Ancients unless where he thought fit to enlarge and other wise to demonstrate some of the Propositions from more easie Prin ciples of his own pursuing herein his own former method in which some years ago he publisht an entire Euclid in 80 Besides this Edition contains a new Version of Archimedes his Lemmata which were not formerly publisht with the rest of Ar chimedess Works though to be found in Forsters Miscellaniesand at the end of Joh Alph Borellis Edition of the three latter Books of Apolloniuss Conicks The Intelligent Reader will readily acknowledge that our Au thor had cause to find fault as he doth with the Cimmerian dark ness of Rivaltus his Edition who is also much complained of by Mydorgius in his Conicks and by Alex Anderson the Scot in his Mathematical Exercises The315 The Stationer that hath printed this Robert Scot intends to re print the abovementiond Euclid as a part of another Volume of the Ancientsin the said Method the residue of which Volume may be an abridgment of Pappus Serenus and the three latter Books of Apollonius with such other small Tracts of the Ancientsas have ei ther been recoverd or restored by the Industry of this and the last Age But these Tracts being not as yet all in readiness for the Press the Learned that have any lucubrations thereon or have prepard any of them for publike view would much oblige the Mathemati cal World by imparting the same The same Stationer sells likewise the former Treatises of Dr Barrowbeing Optical and Geometrical Lecturesto the latter where of there are now made some elegant Additions de Maximis  Mi nimis II Thomae Bartholini A C T A M E D I C A  P H I L O S O P H I C A Hafniensia Anni 1673 Hasniae 1675 in 40 THis Collection being in our opinion not less curious and considerable than that which was made by the same Author for the years 1671 1672 and described No 97 of these Tracts we cannot give less regard to it than we did to the former It contains 134 partly Physiological partly Medical Observa tions among which there occurr these that seem to us remarkable above the rest 1 That there may be Spittings of blood rather beneficial to the Patient than fatal whether they be made from the Spleen or the Lungs forasmuch as they may discharge the Vessels of those parts from a superabundance of blood and serve instead of a necessary venae section Of which are here alledged divers notable Exam ples accompanied with good cautions p 10 11 2 Of a strange recovery together with the method used there in of Christian IV King of Denmark fallen with his Horse into a Ditch of 22 feet perpendicular depth and remaining for a great while speech and senseless p 16 3 Of the sickness and death of a Duke of Brunswick caused by immoderate eating of raw frults and sallats which bred in that Prince besides other symptoms store of worms of which one was voided by him 9 Danishells long another was found in his colon after he was dead of the length of 5 such ells p 26 28 T t 2 4 Of316 4 Of a Woman in Copenhagen that cannot live without the dai ly use of Opium which she now takes to the quantity of a whole dram a day having first begun with a few grains p 50 5 Of an observation made by some Midwives affirming that the Secundine of Twins is double when the Births are of different Sexes but single when of one and the same p 53 6 Of Plants emitting a smell only in the night as a sort of Cranes bill a sort of Dogsrose or Briarbush c of which this proba ble reason is given by Borrichius that their smell is not perceived though they have it in the day time because Sunbeams do so much dissipate the effluvia that are so very subtile as that they cannot af fect our nostrils whereas after Sunsetting they are condensed and so by a stronger and closer contexture make a greater impressi on upon us p 60 7 Of Sneesing very beneficial in diseases of the Eyes p 64 8 That by certain experiment that oily substance calld Sper ma Ceti is extracted and depurated from the Brains of the greater sort of Whales p 69 9 That Nature commonly doth compensate the defect of one thing with some other thing Of which the Author here gives In stance in an Artificer who though he was quite blind yet was able exquisitely to carve in wood to the admiration of the King of Denmark who had him so vailed that if he should have any sight could make no use of it to deceive Of which same man tis here also affirmd that by feeling he could discern the several kinds of wood and colours p 78 10 Many curious Observations made by D Steno about incuba ted Eggs p 81 11 Of a Child bornthough dead after that the mother who had gone her full time and was come to her travel had been dead al most two dayes And of another child yet imperfect that was born with the Secundine sticking so close to it that the Birth could not be got out yet by its motion was found to be alive Which begat a controversie between two Priests at Bergamo in Italy whereof one having baptized this Child in that condition the Child soon expiring thereupon was not admitted to burial by another Priest who denied it to have been baptized because forsooth the physi cal contact of the water had been hindred by the enwrapping Se cundine p 92 93 12 Tha317 12 That the probable reason why Brothers or Sisters or Twins that are far distant from one another not seldom fall sick of the small pox at the same time may be drawn from the retention of the menstrual blood fermenting and thence breaking out at the same time in both p 105 13 Observations about the generation of Frogs made by put ting up Frog spawn in a glassand shifting the water every dayand so keeping it exposed to the Sun in the Spring together with a remark concerning the probability of Frogs being bred in the bel lies of men after the like manner touching which here is alledged a strange example of a Servingmaid that voided at the mouth two great Toads and four small ones and two small Lizards all alive p 108 14 A Method for attaining the Art of Physick in a short time prescribed by the Author of these Collections p 122 15 Of a certain and plain remedy for the Colick being the chawed Root of an herb that grows in the most Northern parts of Norway called Naput and there used with excellent success by those that work in Mines This root is said not to be unpleasant to the tast tasting at first like a flat Reddish and afterwards approaching to the tast of Angelica  p 124  This Root should be further inquired after and brought over by those that sail into Norway 16 Of a kind of Grass called Ossifragum growing in Norway and comming forth before all other grass which being eaten by their Catle emaciates them and makes them sick and their backbones protuberant and their legs and all their bones so weak that they can hardly go Which is supposed to proceed from some Mercu rial or other maligne steams that get into this grass and that being eatenaffect the Nerves The Countrypeople cure it with giving to such Catle dryed bones broken into small pieces which the Ca tle very greedily devour having first ground it small between their teeth whereupon follows a salivation that perfectly cures them p 126 c 17 Observations about the motion of the Heart the Auricles thereof and the Vena cava drawn from the diffection of divers A nimals performed by DStenowho thence inferrs 1that the inter mitted motion of the Heart taken out of those creatures returns upon any vellication made either by some solid body as a pin knife318 knife nail c or by the steams or dilatation of the blood 2that the motion of the Heart is not in the whole substance but in every fibre thereof and not only in fibres entire but also such as want both extremes 3 that those fibres are contracted not all at once but by parts litle by litle beginning from one end and so conti nuing to the other as is seen in the Peristaltique motion of the In testins Where the observer intimates that hitherto nothing hath been discoverd to give us the true Cause and Manner of Animal motion p 141147 18 An Observation concerning the Milk of a Nursingmother tasting of Wormwood from the frequent use of an extract of Worm wood of which for some time she had taken every day some drops in her broth to strengthen her stomach weakend by a feaver into which she was fallen being with child p 165 19 The controversie about the real Inexistence of Volatil Salts in bodies discussed by the Author who asserts that they are only separated not produced by the fire p 174 20 That the Fixed Salts comming from Animals are not all of the same nature nor do in all things agree either with common Salt or with the Lixiviat Salt of Plants To prove whichmany Instan ces are alledged by the Author p 184 21 That tis very difficult to assign the reason why Acid Spi rits are coagulated into Salt without any additament and that this Salt adheres to the outside of the glasscovers none at all of it stick ing to the inside of them when they contain such spirits p 193 22 An odd case of a woman quite loosing her memory ex reten tione mensium but recovering it again by a cautery in the neck free ing her from that obstruction p 196 23 That there is no Medicin more effectual against hypochon driacal inflations and gripings of the belly than the root of Zedoa ria and that nothing is better puerperis quibus lochia cessant than the same root pulverised half a drachm to a dose moistened with two or three drops of Rosemary oyl and taken in a little warm wine p 209 24 Considerable Observations about Eggs in Viviparous Ani mals by Steno p 210 25 That in a torpedo according to the same Steno there are found Fibers thicker than the greater sort of Goosequills that are soft and white and lying on both sides of the fish perpendicular ly319 ly between the upper and lower coatare separated from one ano ther by transverse fibres and receive manifest nerves transversly entring into them for motion And that those fibers take up the room that is between the lateral fins and the gills and head as far as to the region of the Abdomen the foremost being in this position shorter than the hindmost That the Animal being alive this place was indeed soft to the touchbut if at the same time you touch ed it the fish did contract it self there was then felt a contraction at the end of your fingers with a kind of creeping pain over the whole arm continuing for a while though when the fish did not stir one felt nothing no more than when the fish was dead p 224 26 Of Eggs found by the said Steno in the Testicles of a Mule and of a kind of placenta appearing in one of them Whence he concludes that Mules may breed without a miracle p 230 27 Of an Experiment seeming to shew that Blood is made in and by the Chyle being in any part of the body and not by the Heart aloneforasmuch as a learned man found in the Chyle contain ed in the Lacteal vessels and there kept by a ligature for some hours a red liquor most like to blood instead of the Chyle To which Experiment Dr Thomas Bartholin offers his answer p 245 28 That an Acid is connate in Animals nor is destroyed by their death witness the Runnet found in the folds of the stomachs of Calves and Lambs which is employed in the making of Cheese yet is not found in such as feed upon hay but milk that Acid pe rishing as soon as the young Animal is weaned To which the Au thor adds that the whole stomach of hoggs when dried and clean sed is used also for separating the Caseous substance from the Mil ky p 258 29 That the Seed of Lunaria poisons Catteleating thereof but the Leaves recover them As also that the Leaves of the herbami mosa are poisonous but the Root of the same cures the poison Worth the experimenting upon dogs and such like Animals p265 30 Of many examples of diseases transplanted p 267 How credible the judicious Reader may judge Amongst others of a Quartan cured by putting hot bread under the Armpits and other junctures of the body and giving it when moistend by sweat to a dogg to eat And of the yellow Jaundies cured by making a cake of the urine of such a patient and of flower and giving it to a dogg cat or fox 84 Of320 31 Of several remedies commended to be highly efficacious a gainst the biting of mad doggs p 274 32 Of Worms found in pepper reduced by them to dust p 277 33 Of an Ophthalmique unguent highly extolled for curing desparately sore weak and dark eyes viz R Ungu Nihili and of Tutia aa 3ij of Pearl red CoralCrabseyes and Tutiaall pre pared aa j of Camphir gr 6 of leafgold and leafsilveraa 4 in number Mix all well and when the Patient goes to bedlet him put into the great corner of the eye the bigness of a vetch and a noint the underside of the Eyelids with the same p 302 34 Several Observations concerning Amber delivered by the Author that the intelligent Reader upon due examination may judge whether that substance be a Juyce of the Earth or of a Tree p 309 35 An Ana omical description of a Parrot dissected chiefly for this end that those organs might be discoverd whereby that Bird before other Birds emulates human Speech p 314 too long to be transcribed hither 36 An Accompt of all the Muscles in an Eagle diffected by the Learned Steno where occurr many considerable remarks relating to the general doctrine of Muscles p 320 to 345 37Of an iron dart stuck in the brain of a Borussian Knight four teen years that came at last out of the throat by suppuration III The Epitome of the whole Art of Husbandry with Additions of New Experiments thereto belonging Written by JBGent in 30 London 1675 THE most Ingenious Master of Agriculture is bold to require for perfection in Husbandry a great measure of knowledge in Philosophy Nam qui se in hac scientia perfectum volet profiteri sit oportetrerum naturae sagacissimusdeclinationum mundi non ignarus ut exploratum habeat quid cuique plagae conveniat quid repugnet c saith Colum Praef It is but half an Age or in fresh memory since Improvements in Husbandry began to have any name or to bear any credit in Eng land Sir Hugh Plat had a long and tedious task and spent many years in Pleas Defences Apologies Sollicitations Printing and Reprinting321 Reprinting many Tracts before the Husbandry would stirr But by Importunities and Perseverance at last he prevailed so farr that in most Countys they were convinced and began to seeand taste and enjoy the publique benefit And after our dismal Wars broke out in the intervals some were by necessity constraind to seek out all advantages they could hear of and some had great oppor tunities for any hopeful or famous Essays And thus on a sudden the humor and spirit of a People is alterd Books of Husbandry are sold off as fast as the Press can print them Sir Hugh Plats Gar den and Jewel House Hartlibs Legacy Bees a part and Silk worms Gab Plants Sir RichWestons Husbandry of Flanders Capt Blith Any thing that seemd new and probable And all our Old Georgical Writers are called to a New accompt Tussers old rimes are fetcht out of the grave and dust and happy hewho had got ten Surflets Countryfarm largely extracted out of Charles Stevens John Liebault Serres Vinet all French Albyterio the Spaniard and Grylli the Italian all revived and enlarged by Markham The next in old esteem was Googes noble Heresbachius and many Writers of Gardens Orchards and Bees But of Bees never any so accurately and philosophically as Learned Samuel Purchas in his Theater of Political Flying Insects especially Bees Where we may see the most diligent both of the ancient and modern many times overrefuted by satisfying Experiments and ocular demonstrati ons Of these Hartlibs Legacy and Sir Rich Westons Husbandry of Brabant carried the greatest esteem and prevalency in these days each of them soon comming abroad in a fourth Edition with amend ments and additions By all which helps and improvements the Soyl and Agriculture of England was very much entriched above what it was in the Reign of Queen Elizabeth Since his Majesties Return the Judicious have desired to see the several kinds and improvements in Husbandryas now they succeed best in the several parts of England chiefly from the remotest parts East and West South and North from the Champian Counties and the Vale of Esomfrom Wales and all the Borders of Wales ho ping also to receive in timea good accompt from Scotland Ireland and the Northern parts of America For tis observd that there is great variety of Soyls in England differing kinds of Agricultureand that our very Cattel Oxen Cows V v Sheep322 Sheep Swine yea and if well heeded our Horses do differin e very of our Provinces in shape colour or some other property And first the Public is obliged to J B Gent for the System or Mystery of Husbandry and to Mr Rea for many considerable Ex periments One of them as I take it from the Borders of Wales For the foregoing reasons I shall extract our Author more pun ctually in such order as it lyes though not in perfect order re ferring to his pages hoping that he will not be discouraged from publishing his Second part of New Experiments which may seem in a manner promised to the Reader His language is very plain not uneasie for the honest Husbandman The Book compriseth ma ny of the most necessary directions for Improvements Some of them indeed to be found in other Tracts by us formerly menti ond but most of them confirmed by the Authors own diligent Observations and Experience as the Epistle saith and many of them which are for peculiar uses first discoverd by his own Essays 1 He discourseth of

ordinarily curi ous and large from 51 to 136 3 He notes it pag 136 to be very observable that no Animal besides Birds can learn or by any means be taught to speak or to imitate a mans voice We may add Nor yet to imitate and much less to emulate Mans singing or any music made by man As our Author records a hot and continued contention between a Gentle man of his Acquaintance and a Nightingale free in a Grove for the victory in singing 79 which story supports the credit of the old contention between the Nightingale and the Lutenist celebrated in the Elegant Poesie of Famianus Strada And the famous Lord Peyreske gave his vote as Gassendus tells us for the music of Birds above any Harmony that man can make And the music of Birds is then sweetest when they are free and at full liberty and cannot complain of restraint in a Grove and where they can choose their Consorts and the places and postures of approach or di stance and with choice of Echoes as our Author noted in the Nightingals and Woodlarks two Nightingals to two Wood larks 79 And we have not seen any Animals more fondly loving to Mankind than Birds And it seems easie to tame Birds to resort to what Groves we please and some have performed it there to build their Nests and to breed up their young only being furnish ed with fit materials at hand And for such as cannot bear our Win ter or our Summer they may in season be invited into clean en closures And when at liberty they may be confined to one Grove or Thicket adorned with fragrant and healthbreathing Trees and  from fruitful Groves where they are hurtful though neither325 neither be many furlongs distant from each other nor from the Lords Mansion Neither is there scarce any Animal so fierce but may be tamed by Music or by some other way of Circuration most of them for Human use For proof of which I referr to two ingenuous Chapters the 8th chapt of Music and the 11th of The Art of taming wild Beasts in the brief Treatise of Human Industry or Of Human Wit which deserves to be corrected and reprinted and continually augmented as Arts grow on so that this Treatise may grow on as Dictionaries have grown to more perfection These are for words and discourses That for Realities Arts and Sciences Since the most furious of Mankind and the fiercest of other A nimals may be tamd by Music as is there instanced chap 8 and since the Crocodile Serpents Fishes and Seamonsters may be made fond and serviceable to Mankind as is copiously there in stanced chap 11 we may thence hope and presume that the Ci curation of all Animals in the Groves and Woods in the Wilderness Seas and Rivers may hereafter come into more esteem and into more general use and practise than now it is and more compleatly to assert Mans dominion over this whole Globe than hitherto is at tained And that this discipline is not a very Novelty but of old be longing to Agriculture according to the staunch method of learn ed Varro when he was 80 years old we have his

Lion Quid326 Quid quod abire domo rursusque in claustra reverti Suetus  a capta jam sponte recedere praeda Insertasque manus laeto dimittere morsu c Our American Colonies are concernd for the one and for the o ther for the taming of Man and Beasts both the Savages and the Wildernesses And some have a peculiar faculty and promptness for both But to tame the wild and savage Man is the hardest task as Xenophon saith     and as Seneca Nullum est animal homine morosius aut majore arte tractandum Yet we hear That the Savages in many parts for a good gust in dressing the Venison which they have taken and for other uncostly gratifi cations will prove better hunters then our best Kennels and very serviceable upon the boldest and most difficult adventures on the Land or in the Water And as those Singingbirds in the opini on of some are tamed to best purpose which are free and at call in the Groves so also are those Savages tamed best who taste the truest freedom in Civil Government and Civil Manners in good Discipline and in a life of agreeable delights and reasonable sa tisfaction This were to retrive the prudence of the old Romans whilst they raised their Empire Then they reclaimed more Barba rians by their ingenious Civilities than they subdued by oppressi on and force as is gravely testified by Salust But when they became unnatural by their luxury and divisions then they suffered the Inundations and fell under the feet of Barbarians And no Treat can be more safe innocent and effectual for an un reclaimd people to reduce them to apply their ears to the best do cuments than Music Sometimes to make their Wilderness eccho with the Trumpet Cornet and loudest Musick Sometimes to cheer up all with the merry Flagellate Flute Fife and Pipe And when the game is ended to sweeten all with the Lute Harps and Violins Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci A

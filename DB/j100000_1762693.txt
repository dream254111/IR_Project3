secured in the fan shown which is made by the Buffalo Forge Company of Buffalo NY CLARK UNIVERSITY1 WE are here to mark in a simple way as befits its dignity a rare event which we hope and pray may prove not only the most important in the history of this favored city but of forever grow ing significance for our state and nation for culture and humanity Located with great forethought in a city whose culture ensures that enlighted public sentiment so needful in maintaining the high est possible academic standards in a city whose wealth and good will we trust are as fair a promise as can anywhere be given or asked of that perpetual increase of revenue now required by the rapid progress of science in a city central among the best colleges of the East whose work we wish not only to supplement but to stimulate whose higher interests we hope to serve and whose good will ancl active cooperation we invite governed by trustees of eminence in the nation as well as in the state who ask no sec tarian and no political questions of their appointees whlose influ ence without and whose counsels within are of inestimable and well appreciated value consecrating ourselves to the toil of science at an hour so peculiarly critical and so opportune in the university development of the country  I must believe that not only every intelligent inhabitant of Worcester but every unbiased friend of higher education everywhere will wish to add to our already un expectedly large endowment of public and private good will at home and abroad his and her hearty ungrudging and reiterated Godspeed Just because instead of the easy and wasteful task of repeating what is already well done about us we strive to take the inevitable next step and to be the first if we can upon the higher plane because we must study not only to utilize all available experience wherever we can but to be wisely bold in innovations wherever we must because there will be indifference and misconception from friends who do not see all the importance of our work at first be cause there are difficulties inherent in the very nature of that work itself as great as the work is needed  we must go slowly and surely establishing but few departments at first and when they are made the best possible adding new and most related ones as fast as we can find the men and money to support them We must prolong the formative period of foundation and must each and every one realize well that we are just entering upon years of unremitting toil in which patience and hope will be tempered with trial But our cause is itself an inspiration for it is in the current of all good tendencies in higher education and of the ultimate success of what is this day begun there is not a shadow of doubt or of fear Our history begins more than twenty years ago in the plans of a reticent and sagacious man whose leave we cannot here await to speak of who in affluence maintains the simple and regular mode of life inbred in the plain New England home of his boyhood  plans that have steadily grown with his forture and that have been followed and encouraged with an eager and growing interest which extended to even minor items by the devoted companion of his life Besides a large fund already placed to our account he has given his experience and unremitting daily care worth to us large sums in economies and resulting in wellappointed buildings and a solidity of materials and a thoroughness of workmanship which I believe are without a parallel of their cost and kind in the country Not only in the multifarious work of

G Stanley Hall at the opening of Clark Univer sity Worcester Mass on Oct 2 I889 VOL XV No 362 appeal to all who have the instinct of discipline and which are ex ceptionally needful where the life of science is to be so free and the policy so independent in the express exemption too of all in structors who can sustain the ardor of research from excessive teaching and examination in the appointment of assistants in a way to keep each member of the staff at his best work and to avoid the too common and wasteful practice in American universities of letting fourthousanddollar men do fourhundreddollar work in the ample equipment of each department that no force be lost on inferior tools in all these and many other respects the ideal of our founder has been to make everywhere an independent applica tion of the simplest and severest but also the largest principles of business economy As business absorbs more and more of the talent and energy of the world its considerations more and more pervading if not sub ordinating whether for better or worse not only the arts the school the press but all departments of church and state making peace and war cities or deserts so science is slowly pervading and profoundly modifying literature philosophy education religion and every domain of culture Both at their best have dangers and are severe schools of integrity The directness simplicity cer tainty and absorption in work so characteristic of both are setting new fashions in manners and even in morals and bringing man into closer contact with the world as it is Both are binding the universe together into new unities and imposing a discipline ever severer for body and mind When their work purified of deceit and error is finished the period of history we now call modern will be rounded to completeness culture will have abandoned much useless luggage the chasm between instruction and educa tion will be less disastrous and all the highest and most sacred of humnan ideals will not be lost or dimmed but will become nearer and more real When one who has graduated with highest honors from this rigorous school of business after spending eight years of travel abroad studying the means by which knowledge and culture the most precious riches of the race  are increased and transmitted and finding no reason why our country which so excels in busi ness should be content with the second best in science devotes to its services not only his fortune at the end of his life but also years yet full of exceptional and unabated energy we see in such a fact not only the normal complete if you please postgraduate ethical maturity of an individual business life but also a type and promise of what wealth now seems likely to do for higher education in America It is no marvel that our foundation has already been so often so conspicuously and so favorably noted in authoritative ways and places in an European land where if monarchy should yield to a republic university culture could not penetrate its peo ple as it now does It is thus a more typical and vital product of the national life at its best than are foundations made by state or church in which to train their servants In thus giving his fortune to a single highest end as sagaciously and actively as he has ac quired it may our founder find a new completeness of life in age which Cicero did not know and taste  all the joy that lies in a full selfsacrifice The very word  science especially when used in its relation to business is too often degraded by cheap graduates who are just fit to look after established industrial processes but are useless if competition finds or needs new and better ones who certify to analyses of commercial products that good chemists know are im possible  who if international competition in manufactures were more free would give place to better trained perhaps German ex perts still faster than they are doing who in criminal medical and patentlaw suits often have the address to carry judge and jury against far better chemists but who have no conception of the higher quality and more rigorous methods of their own sci ence who make chemistry physics and geology mercenary culi nary the servants instead of the masters of industrial progress and the very  lifesprings of all the arts of peace or war This evil although so great and common that even the best men in other professions too rarely see the high ideal culturepower of real science is yet only incidental and temporary A good illustration of the high and normal technological value of pure science is at hand in dyeing one of the most scientific amongSCIENCE the many and increasing chemical industries England furnishes nearly all the raw formerly valueless material for coaltar colors out of which Germany made most of the seventeen and a half mil lion dollars worth manufactured in I88o England bought back a large fraction of the colored goods and Germany made the profits because she could furnish the best training in pure chem istry It is for this reason that she is driving other countries out of the field in other leading chemical industries The great facto ries there employ from two or three to more than a score each of good and often the best universitytrained chemists at large sala ries and the best of these spend a good part of their time in origi nal research in the factory laboratories The prospect of these lucrative careers has had very much to do in filling the chemical laboratories of the universities with hundreds of students and the German government best that of Prussia has met the demand by erecting and equipping new and sometimes magnificent laborato ries at nearly all of her universities New artificial processes of making organic products of commerce have freed thousands of acres of land where they were formerly grown and have made new industries and often impaired old ones Many professors of chem istry make large outside incomes Nearly all are sanguine some even declare that before very long leading drugs and even food that will equal if not actually excel natures products will be made artificially The leading professor in one of the largest chemical laboratories of Germany told me in substance that he no longer went after outside technical work but now made it a virtue to wait for it to seek him and it has been strongly urged that even the government should take steps to prevent the migration of German chemists to the universities of other countries lest Germany lose her preeminence in chemical industries This remarkable contact of the marvellous new businesslife and energy of Germany particularly of North Germany which in both suddenness and vigor equals any of the wonderful developments in this country with staid and tranquil academic ways has had some marked reverberations and given new direction and impetus to other studies in some other departments where it is not directly felt It has led to the erection and equipment by the government of great technological schools and has shown to business men and employers that no course in the sciences which underlie tech nology can be too advanced prolonged or severe to be practical Where ought the value and significance of such a training be bet ter appreciated than here in the land of Fulton Morse Bell and Edison  There are however eminent chemists in Germany and many more in surrounding European countries who deplore what they call the irruption of the technical spirit into the universities They fear the proximity of the factory and the patent office to the uni versity laboratory has narrowed the field of view and made meth ods of research relatively less severe they complain that in their teaching they must hasten over inorganic chemistry neglecting all the other elements for the carbon compounds and that there are almost no inorganic chemists in Germany that in choosing between several substances inviting research one of which prom ises great commercial value and the other none strict scientific im partiality is lost that in the eagerness for practical results prob lems are attempted too complex for the present methods of experi menters who are trying to  eat soup with a fork as one sadly told me and that thus while published researches are more nu merous they are less thorough and have introduced many formulae that neither prove nor agree so that much work now accepted must be done over again and far more thoroughly that even Liebig set a bad example in this respect and that nmany new products of which university chemists boast are so inferior to those of nature as to be really adulteration What I have tried to illustrate mainly in the field of one science is more or less true under changed ways and degrees in the sphere of others The sciences are also at the very heart of modern med ical studies Biology explores the laws of life upon which not only these studies but human health welfare and modern concep tions of man and his place in nature so fundamentally rest The law of the specific energy of nerves eg which Helmholtz says equals in importance the Newtonian law of gravity and more than anything else made physiology the science which has had so large I9 a share in raising the medical profession in Germany to a position in the intellectual world such as it never had before doing for it in some degree what chemistry has done for dyeing and even instruments like the ophthalmoscope which almost created a de partment of medical practice or the spectroscope now indispensa ble in the Bessemer process in sugar refining in wine and colordye tests the detection of photographic sensibilators in the custom house and in two important forms of medical diagnosis  all these to cut short a long list of both epochmaking laws and im portant instruments are the direct products of wholesouled devo tion to unremunerative scientific research It is hard for medical students to realize that they cannot under stand hygiene forensic medicine pharmacology and toxicology without a rigorous drill in chemistry that they must know physics to understand the diagnostic and therapeutic use of electricity ophthalmology otology the mechanism of the bones muscles cir culation etc that zoology is needed to teach sound philosophic thought generic facts about the laws of life health reproduction and disease These and sometimes also sciences like mineralogy anthropology and psychology are required in Europe with much more rigor than is common with us of every medical student Thus doctors like technologists cannot know too much pure sci ence An eminent medical practitioner in Europe compares young physicians who slight the basal sciences of their profession and pass on to the clinical therapeutic and practical parts to young men who grow prematurely old and sterile The phrase of Hip pocrates  Godlike is the physician who is also a philosopher is still more true and good in its larger more modern and looser translation viz exalted is the physician who knows not only the most approved methods of practice but also the pure sciences which underlie and determine both the dignity and the value of his profession Medical instruction on the one hand must select as its founda tion those sciences and those parts of the sciences most useful in e meeting mans great enerny disease It needs far more anat omy than physics and little mathematics astronomy or geology Technical instruction on the other hand is and must be so organ ized as to reflect the state of industry It properly lays more stress upon chemistry with its many applications than upon biol ogy which has far fewer more upon electricity than upon molec ular physics and more upon organic than inorganic chemistry The university which is entirely distinct from and higher than any form of technical or professional instruction can be should represent the state of science yper se It should be strong in those fields where science is highly developed and should pay less attention to other departments of knowledge which have not reached the scien tific stage It should be financially and morally able to disregard practical application as well as numbers of students It should be a laboratory of the highest possible human development in those lines where educational values are the criterion of what is taught or not taught and the increase of knowledge and its diffusion among the few fit should be its ideal As another puts it  The more and better books apparatus collections and teachers and the fewer but more promising students the better the work In Europe besides its duty to science the university must not fail of its practical duty to furnish to the state good teachers preachers doctors advocates engineers and technologists of various kinds Here a university can if it chooses do still better and devote itself exclusively to the pure sciences These once understood their ap plications are relatively easy and quickly learned The university must thus stand above subordinate and fructify the practical spirit or the latter will languish for want of science to apply The important facts that are both certain and exact and the completely verified laws or well ordered welded cohesion of thought that approach such mental continuity as makes firm com pactly woven intellectual or cerebral tissue are so precious in our distracted and unsettled age that it is no marvel that impartial laymen in all walks of life are coming to regard modern science in its pure high form as not only the greatest achievement of the race thus far but also as carrying in it the greatest though not yet well developed culture power of the world not only for knowledge but also for feeling and conduct It is of this power that universities are the peculiar organs to them is now committed the highest in JANUARY 10 I89020 SCIENCE terests of man from them and from science now come the light and advancement of the world They became and remained the asylums of free thought and conviction when Rome and all other privileged orders declined and their germs were brought and pi ously and early planted on these shores by our fathers The term is not only  the noblest in the vocabulary of science but univer sities are the chief nurseries of talent where is kept alive the holy fervor of investigation that in its passion for truth is fearless of consequences and has never been more truly and loftily ideal than now when its objects of study are often most crassly material It is their quality more than any thing else that determines not only the status of the medical and all technological professions but also whether the legal profession is formal narrow mercenary and un learned as it seems now in danger of becoming in Germany be cause even the German universities despite their great preemi nence in allother respects are by general consent of the most competent Germans themselves relatively weak in those depart ments which underlie the practice of law or broadly based on his tory and social or economic science informed in administrative ex perience and culminating in judicial talent and statesmanship Universities largely determine whether a land is cursed by a fac tious superstitious halfcultured clergy or blessed by ministers of divine truth who understand and believe the doctrines they teach who attract and enlarge the most learned and penetrate the life of the poor and ignorant quickening comforting and informing in a way worthy the Great Teacher himself and making their profes sion as it should bethe noblest of human callings Compared with our material progress we are not only making no progress but are falling behind in higher education It has been estimated that but five per cent of the practising physicians of this country have had a liberal education and that sixty per cent of our medical schools require practically no preliminary train ing whatever for admission while European laws require a uni versity training for every doctor before he can practice Again we apply science with great skill but create or advance it very little indeed Should the supply of European science which now so promptlyfinds its way here and fertilizes and stimulates to more or less hopeful reaction our best scholars and upon which we live as upon charity be cut off by some great war or otherwise the un balanced and shortsighted utilitarian tendencies now too prevalent here would tend toward the same stagnation and routine which similar tendencies unchecked long ago wrought out in China We all most heartily believe in and respect technical and applied science and all grades of industrial education but these are as much out of place in a truly academic university as moneychangers were in the temple of the Most High But yet the fact that these and other evils and difficulties are now so widely seen and so deeply felt that endowments for higher education seem now the order of the day that the largest single endowment in this country has already so effectively begun so many reforms in scarcely more than a decade in Baltimore that churchmen statesmen and business men now need only to see their own interests in a way a little larger and broader as they are now tending to do to cooperate more actively than they ever have done in strengthening our best foundations  such considerations sustain the larger and more hopeful view that our country is al ready beginning to rise above the respectable and complacent mediocrity still its curse in every domain of culture and will show that democracy can produce  as it must or decline  the very highest type of men as its leaders The university problem seems to be fairly upon us We now need men in our chairs whose minds have got into independent motion who are authorities and not echoes who have the high moral qualities of plain and simple living and selfsacrificing devotion to truth and who show to this community and the country the spectacle of men absorbed in and living only for pure science and high scholarship and are not mere placeholders or sterile routine pedagogues and all needed material support is sure to come A word so characteristic here that it might stand upon our very seal is concentration Of this our founder in declining to scatter his resources among the countless calls from individuals institutions and causes from excellent to vicious and refusing us as yet in the one work he has set out to accomplish no needed VOL XV No 362 thing sets an example We have selected a small but closely re lated group of five depaltments and shall at first focus all our means and care to make these five the best possible Neither the historical origin nor the term  university have any thing to do with completeness of the field of knowledge The word originally designated simply a corporation with peculiar privileges and peculiarly independent to do what it chose We choose to assert the same privilege of election for ourselves that other institutions allow their students and offer the latter in choosing their subjects a larger option between institutions The continental habit of interuniversity migration also on the part of students if once adopted here would no doubt stimulate institutions no less than it has stimulated competing departments in the same university Our plan in this respect implies a specialization as imperatively needed for the advanced students as it would we admit be un fortunate for students still in the disciplinary collegiate stage If our elementary schools are inferior to the best in Europe and if our fitting schools are behind the French Lycee the German gymnasium and the great English schools it is our universities that are comparatively by far the weakest part of our national sys tem The best of these best know that fifty or one hundred in structors cannot do the work of three hundred and fifty that they cannot hope at present to rival European governments which erect single university buildings costing nearly four million dollars each as at Berlin and Vienna nor equal the clinical opportunities of large European cities with poorer populations and more concen trated hospital systems Our strongest universities are far too feeble to do justice to all the departments old and new which they undertake Our institutions are also too uniform the small and weak ones try to copy every new departure of the stronger ones as the latter copy the far stronger institutions in Europe If the best of them would do work of real university grade should they specialize among the fields of academic culture doing well what they do but not attempting to do every thing the American sys  tem might yet come to represent the highest educational needs of the country In contrast with the present ideal of horizontal expan sion and fhe waste of unnecessary duplication we believe our de parture will be as useful as it is new Again concentration is now the master word of education In no country has the amount of individual information been so great the range of intelligence so wide the number of studies attempted by young men in colleges and universities so large for the time and labor given to each the plea for liberal and general as distinct from special and exclusive studies been so strong This is well for general knowledge is the best soil for any kind of eminence or culture to spring from and because power though best applied on a small surface is best developed over a large one and not in brains educated as it were in spots More than this our utilitarian ideal of general knowledge is far more akin to that of Hippias who would make his own clothes and shoes cook his own food etc or to that of Diderot who would learn all trades than to the noble Greek ideal of the symmetrical allsided development of all the powers of body and mind The more general knowledge the better but every thing must shoot together in the brain In the figure of Ritcher the sulphur saltpetre and charcoal must find each other or the man makes no powder The brain must be trained to bring all that is in it to a sharp focus without dispersive fringes The natural instinct of every ambitious youth is to excel to do or make or know something better than any one else to be an authority to surpass all others if only in the most accuminated speciality Learning thus what true mental freedom is he is more docile in all other directions If it be extravagant to say that no minds are so feeble that they cannot excel if they concentrate all their energies upon a point sufficiently small nothing is more true than that the greatest pow ers fail if too much is attempted This is not only a wise instinct that makes for economy but in the parliamentary committee roomns in corporation meetings in the court room in business in science in the sickchamber the modern world in nearly every de partment is now really governed by experts  by men who have attained the mastery that comes by concentration The young man who has had the invaluable training of abandoning himself to a long experimental research upon some very special but happilySCIENCE chosen point was typically illustrated in a man I knew With the dignity and sense of finality of the American senior year quick within him his first teacher in Germany told him to study experi mentally one of the score of muscles of a frogs leg He feared loss and limitation in trying to focus all his energies upon so small and insignificant an object The mild dissipation of too general culture the love of freedom and frequent change aided by a taste for breezy philosophic romancing almost diverted him from the frogs leg But as he progressed he found that he must know in a more minute and practical way than before  in a way that made previous knowledge seem unreal  certain definite points in elec tricity chemistry mechanics physiology etc and bring them to bear in fruitful relation to each other As the experiments pro ceeded through the winter the history of previous views upon the subject were studied and understood as never before and broader biological relations gradually seen The summer and yet another year were passed upon this tiny muscle for be had seen that its laws and structure are fundamentally the same in frogs and men that just such contractile tissue has done all the work man has ac complished in the world that muscles are the only organ of the will Thus as the work went on many of the mysteries of the universe seemed to centre in his theme in fact in the presence and study of this minute object of nature he had passed from the attitude of Peter Bell of whom the poet says A cowslip by the rivers brim A yellow cowslip was to him And it was nothing more up to the standpoint of the seer who  plucked a flower from the crannied wall and realized that could he but understand what it was root and all and all in all he would know what God and man is Even if my friend had contributed nothing in the shape of discovery to the great temple of science he had felt the omne tluit unctum of natures organic unity he had felt the profound and religious conviction that the world is lawful to the core he had experienced what a truly liberal education in the modern as distinct from the mediaeval sense really is We may term it non professional specialization Perhaps the most thorough and comprehensive government re ports ever made in any language are those of the English parlia mentary commissioners on endowments The first of these occu pied nearly nineteen years and fills nearly twoscore heavy folio volumes In all about twenty thousand foundations new and centuries old large and small devoted to a vast variety of uses good and questionable were reported The conclusions drawn from this field of experience which is far richer and wider in Eng land than elsewhere was that of all the great popular charities higher education has proven safest wisest and best and that for two chief reasonr first because the superior integrity and ability of the guardians who consented to administer such funds the in telligence and grateful appreciation of those aided by them and the strong public interest and resulting publicity all three com bined to hold them perpetually truest to the purpose and spirit of the founders and secondly because in improving higher education all other good causes are most effectively aided The church can in no other way be more fundamentally served than by providing a still better training for her ministers and missionaries Charity for hospitals and almshouses is holy Christlike work but to provide a better training for physicians and economists teaches the world to see and shun the causes of sickness and poverty Sympathy must always tenderly help the feeblest and even the defective classes but to help the strongest in the struggle for existence is to help not them alone but all others within their influence Of all the many ways of supporting the higher education indi vidual aid to deserving and meritorious students is one of the most approved In the University of Leipzic eg four hundred and seven distinct funds can aid eight hundred aud fortynine students Of these funds the oldest was established in I325 and they are increasing in number more new ones having been given between I88o and I885 than in any entire decade before In size they range from thirtyfive thousand to fifty dollars in Berlin from one hundred and forty thousand to one of less than forty dollars In cases Where conditions are specified the most frequent limitation is to students from a certain locality and next to those of a certain 21 family By the older founders students of theology were more often preferred but the more recent funds are for medicine law philology and pulrescience and a fund of over two hundred thousand lately given the University of Marburg is for advanced students in those sciences which underlie medicine These funds are often given named for held and sometimes awarded by churches or their pastors magistrates heads of fitting schools boards of education representatives of prominent families for stu dents of their name the donor himself or herself individual pro fessors etc subject of course to satisfying the university exami ners Many are tenable for one more for three and some for five and six years The funds must be invested with pupilary security and with interest commonly less than four per cent In Cambridge and Oxford provision is made for nearly one thousand fellows and eight hundred scholars not to mention the exhibitions at Oxford The fellowships are more lucrative and are designed for more ad vanced men than are provided for in the German universities the fellows aiding the master in internal administration In England besides the religious and other founders as in Germany the great historic industrial and mercantile corporations provide many of the fellowships and scholarships particularly those of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and they are granted by bishops cu rates heads of business corporations masters of the great schools heads or fellows of colleges In France where these foun dations were swept away by the Revolution stipends and bursaries are provided annually by the government New appropriations for the most advanced students of all was the secret of the remarkable Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes founded in i868 of which a recent report just printed for the Exposition says condensing its substance that its purpose has always been to foster scientific zeal with no shade of temporal interest that it restored the almost ob literated idea of higher education gave unity to scientific interests throughout France and made her feel the scholarly desiderata of the age made young professors not only well instructed but trained in good methods that although its profound researches are not manifest to the public it has given a more scientific charac f ter to all the faculties and rendered aservice to the state out of all proportion to its cost In France individuals cooperate with the state in this work Has there ever been devised a form of memorial to and bearing the names of husbands wives children or parents by which even the smallest funds could be bestowed in a way more lastingly ex pressive of tlle individuality spirit and the special lines of interest of the donor more worthy the dead and more helpful to the high est ends of life Since the first endowment of research in the Athenian porch and grove thousands and thousands of donations of this sort have borne tangible witness to the sentiment so often and vividly taught by Plato that in all the world there is no ob ject more worthy of reverence love and service than eugenic eu peptic wellbred gifted young men for in them is the hope of the world The more advanced our standards are to be the fewer will be our students and the more expensive their needed outfit of books and apparatus If we divide our running expenses only by the number of students our present fellowships and scholarships allow us to receive out of our two hundred and fifty applicants the amount we spent per student the first year will probably be with out a parallel Besides this for a number of students with impor tant researches on hand we are expending hundreds of dollars each for their individual needs and should be glad to do so for more as good men The best students very often graduate with empty pockets but with their zeal and power at its best and when an extra year or two would make a great difference in their entire career Also as the field of knowledge grows more complex the economy of energy needed for concentration is impossible without the leisure secured by comfortable support Connected with all the protection exemptions and privileges so dearly prized and tenaciously clung to by the mediaeval universi ties there have always been dangers sometimes grave and not yet entirely obviated The new charity is often popularly called a sci ence as well as a virtue Its axiom is that no man has a right to give doles to beggars without satisfying himself personally or through some agency to that end that his gift will do good and not JANUARY IO 189022 SCIENCE harm to the recipient History and I may add personal observa tion shows that the same general law holds true to some extent in universities I believe they should not award fellowships to men fresh from college save in the very rarest cases unless they were able to guide and direct as well as to follow their work in every de tail A fellow should be encouraged and stimulated by a daily and familiar intercourse with the professors His methods read ing and researches should be kept at their best and the entire re sources of the institution should be a soil for his most rapid and helpful growth Students thus served even if their gratitude does not prompt them as in some late instances in Germany to study revive and try to conform with piety to the ideal of ancient and al most forgotten donors whose provisions they enjoyed will not be lacking in appreciation To appoint a man to use such funds in electing among undergraduate courses or to take his chances among the confusing multifarious subjects offered in foreign insti tutions is I believe in most cases of small utility and in some cases that I know positively harmful May the methods of exclu sion we are studying be so effective that neither our precious funds nor the precious energy of our instructors be wasted upon the idle stupid or unworthy students now too often exposed in vain for four years to the contagion of knowledge Education used to be a question for ladies and for schoolmas ters said a French statesman last spring but it is now not only a question of state on which the support of all great institu tions depends but the great question into which all others issue if profoundly discussed or studied So greatly do republics need the whole power of education and so serious is their struggle for ex istence against ignorance and its attendant evils that it has well been said that the problem whether this form of government be permanent is at bottom a question of education But monarchies are no less dependent upon the education of their leaders and ser vants In his famous address declaring that if Germany was ever to be free and strong it must be by becoming the chief educa tional state of Europe must realize the platonic republic in which the education of its youth was the highest care of the rulers Fichte laid down the policy which has been one of the chief causes of the wonderful development of that country Moreover evolution which shows that even life itself is but the education of proto plasm cells and tissues that the playinstinct in children and the love of culture in adults not only measuie the superfluous individ ual energy over and above that required by the processes neces sary to life but are perhaps largely the same also makes it plain that the hunger for more and larger education of life is but the struggle of talent to the full maturity and leadership which is its right For myself I have no stronger wish or resolve than that in the peculiarly arduous labors I expect I may never forget that this in stitution should be a means to these high purposes and not degen erate to an end in itself and may it be as true of our graduates to remotest tinie as it is of us in a unique way and degree today that we could not love Clark University so much loved we not sci ence and education more HEALTH MATTERS The Influenza A SINGULAR characteristic of the present epidemic of influenza is its delay in visiting the British Isles It seems to have been rampant in Paris and in Germany for some time before it crossed the channel and victims are claimed for Boston even before the existence of the disease in England was acknowledged This naturally raises the question whether it is a disease really brought from a distance Is it anything more than the general prevalence of catarrhal affections of colds and coughs which the time of year and the remarkably unsettled weather we have lately experienced make readily explicable without any foreign importation  Indeed is influenza after all anything more than a severe form of the fashionable complaint of the season  To answer the last question first and so to put it by there can be little doubt that influenza is a distinct specific affection and not a mere modification of the common cold VOL XV No 362 The symptoms the history of the disease and its distribution all justify us in treating it as a distinct and specific disease which when it is prevalent will rarely be mistaken though with regard to isolated and sporadic cases difficulties of diagnosis may arise About its nature or its affinities with other diseases it is unne cessary to speculate It will be sufficient to inquire what its re corded history in the past justifies us in expecting as to its behav ior in the future There are few cases in which history proves so important an element in the scientific conception of a disease as it does in that of influenza For hardly any disease shows a more marked tendency to occur in epidemics  that is in outbreaks strictly limited in point of time After long intervals of inaction or apparent death it springs up again Its chronology is very re markable Though probably occurring in Europe from very early times it first emerged as a definitely known historical epidemic in the year 1510 Since then more than 100 general European epi demics have been recorded besides nearly as many more limited to certain localities Many of them have in their origin and progress exhibited the type to which that of the present year seems to con form We need not go further back than the great epidemic of I782 first traceable in Russia though there believed to have been derived from Asia In St Petersburg on January 2 coincidently with a remarkable rise of temperature from 35 F below freezing to 5Q above 40000 persons are said to have been simultaneously taken ill Thence the disease spread over the Continent where onehalf of the inhabitants were supposed to have been affected and reached England in May It was a remarkable feature in this epidemic that two fleets which left Portsmouth about the same time were attacked by influenza at sea about the same day though they had no communication with each other or with the shore There were many epidemics in the first half of this century and the most important of them showed a similar course and geo graphical distribution In i83o started a formidable epidemic the origin of which is referred to China but which at all events by the end of the year had invaded Russia and broke out in Petersburg in January I83I Germany and France were overrun in the spring and by June it had reached England Again two years later in January I833 there was an outbreak in Russia which spread to Germany and France successively and on April 3 the first cases of influenza were seen in that metropolis all London in Wat sons words  being smitten with it on that and the following day On this same fateful day Watson records that a ship approaching the Devonshire coast was suddenly smitten with influenza and within half an hour forty men were ill In I836 another epidemic appeared in Russia and in January I837 Berlin and London were almost simultaneously attacked Ten years later in i847 the last great epidemic raged Many interesting points are suggested by this historical retro spect What is the meaning of the westward spread of influenza of cholera and other diseases  Is it a universal law To this it must be said that it is by no means the universal law even with influenza which has spread through other parts of the world in every kind of direction but it does seem to hold good for Europe at least in the northern parts The significance of this law as of the intermittent appearance of influenza probably is that this is in Europe not an indigenous disease but one imported from Asia Possibly we may some day track it to its original home in the East as the old plague and the modern cholera have been traced As regards however the European distribution of influenza it has often been thought to depend upon the prevalence of easterly and northeasterly winds There are many reasons for thinking that the contagium of this disease is borne through the air by winds rather than by human intercourse One reason for thinking so is that it does not appear to travel along the lines of human com munications and as is seen in the infection of ships at sea is capable of making considerable leaps The mode of transmission too would explain the remarkable facts noticed above of the sud den outbreak of the disease in certain places and its attacking so many people simultaneously which could hardly be the case if the infection had to be transmitted from one person to another Another important question and one certain to be often asked is suggested by the last namely whether influenza is contagious During former epidemics great care was taken to collect the ex

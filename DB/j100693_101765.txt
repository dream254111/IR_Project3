BEALE,I206877,THE CONTINUATION OF THE HORTULAN AND RURAL ADVERTISEMENTS PROMISED IN THE NEXT FOREGOING TRACT COMMUNICATED BY THE SAME HAND DR JOHN BEALE THE TRACT OF MARCH HAVING AS TO THESE HORTULAN OBSER VATIONS ENDED WITH THE FIFTH PARAGRAPH WE NOW PROCEED TO THE SIXTH WHICH IS TO GIVE NOTICE THAT THE GIDERENGINS FOR THE MORE SPEEDY AND COMMODIOUS MAKING OF GIDER AND PERRY AS THESE ENGINS ARE NOW MADE BY HENRY ALLUN MAY BE SEEN AT THE CABINET IN EXETERSTREET NEAR THE SAVOY AND IN THE PALACE YARD WESTMINSTER THEY MAY BE COMPARED WITH THE CIDER ENGIN BELONGING TO THE CIDERHOUSES AT QUEENHYTH AS ALSO WITH THOSE BELONGING TO THE CIDERHOUSES BEYOND THE TOWER AND WITH THE ENGINS INVENTED BY MR WOLRIDGE OF PETERSFIELD IN HAMPSHIRE AND THE FORMERLY MENTIONED IN N 124 583 AN INGENIOUS GENTLEMAN IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD THE OWNER OF CLIFTON A MILE HENCE HAVING A CORNMILL AND A MALTMILL ON A STREAM NEAR HIS HOUSE HATH LATELY BUILT A CIDERMILL ON THE SAME STREAM WHERE IT RUNS THROUGH HIS ORCHARD AND TIS SAID TO GRIND FRUIT PERFECTLY WELL AND WITH INCREDIBLE DISPATCH THE UPPER STONE IS FITLY HOLLOWD THE WORK DONE BY AN INGENIOUS JOYNER OR CARPENTER IN A NEIGHBOURING VILLAGE AND I HEAR THAT OTHERS ARE NOW DEVISING TO MAKE CIDERMILLS LIKE MALTMILLS TO BE DRAWN ABOUT WITH A HORSE OR TWO AS THEIR OCCASION SHALL REQUIRE MRYARRANTON IN HIS IMPROVEMENT AND DIALOGUEP106 C DESCRIBETH THE WINDMILLS AND WATERMILLS WHICH HE HAD SEEN AMONGST FORREIGNERS FOR THE GREAT BENEFIT OF THE CLOATHING TRADE I HAVE LONG SINCE SEEN THREE MILLSA PAPERMILLA FULLERS MILL FOR THE BENEFIT OF BEWDLEY AND AMILL TO GRIND SCYTHS AND OTHER UTENSILS OF HUSBANDRY ON THE STREAM WHICH FEEDS THE THREE847 THREE FAIR FISHPONDS AT HURCOURTLODGE NEAR KIDERMINSTER IN WORCESTERSHIRE AND I HAVE MARVAILED THAT IN THIS AGE OF EX PERT ENGINEERS AMONGST US WE HAVE NOT YET ANY FLOATINGMILLS TO GRIND CORN UPON SOME OF OUR RIVERS AS IN FRANCE I THOUGHT IT A STRANGE AND PLEASANT SIGHT WHEN THE LOIRE ABOUT ORLEANS WAS ALL OVER COVERD WITH THICK ICE TO SEE SOME HUN DREDS AS WE THOUGHT OF THEIR FLOATING CORNMILLS DRAWN UP INTO THE LOIRET WITHIN SIGHT OF THE SPRINGHEAD FROM WHICH THE RIVER FLOWS IMMEDIATELY WE MAY HAVE NEED OF SUCH HELPWHERE WEARS WHICH HIN DER THE MAKING OF OUR RIVERS NAVIGABLE SHALL BE BROKEN DOWN SOME YEARS AGO I HAVE SEEN ENGINS BOUGHT AT LONDON ABOUT 4 L OR 5 L PRICE TO GRIND WHEAT OR BREADCORN BY THE HANDLABOUR OF A MAN SUFFICIENT FOR A FULL FAMILY WITHOUT MUCH CHARGES AND SO WAS ALL OUR MALT GROUND BY DOMESTICK MALT MILLS IN MY MEMORY THE ANCIENTS DID GRIND ALL THEIR CORN OR POUND IT IN CITIES AND IN ARMIES EVEN IN ROME IN THE AGE OF HER GRANDEUR BY MENS HANDY LABOUR AND BECAUSE MANY DO DISCOURAGE THEMSELVES FROM PLANTING CIDERORCHARDS SAYING THAT IF THEY HAD THE FRUITTHEY SHOULD YET WANT MANY MATTERS TOO COSTLY FOR THEM FOR THEIR SAKES I SHALL HERE INSTANCE THAT IN ALL THE NEIGHBOURHOOD ROUND ABOUT USTHEY THAT MAKE 20 HOGSHEADS OF CIDER YEARLYAND MUCH MORE DO POUND ALL THEIR FRUIT IN TROUGHS MADE FOR THE PURPOSE DEEP AND STRONG WITH BROAD FEETED POUNDERS ONE TWOOR THREE AS THEIR NEED REQUIRETH POUNDING TOGETHER IN THE SAME TROUGH AND TO ME THEY HOLD THE PARADOX STOUTLY THAT WITHOUT MORE COST OR TROUBLE THIS IS THE BEST AND CHEAPEST WAY WORKMEN ARE CHEAPER IN THE COUNTRY AT SOME SEASON THAN IN SOME CITIES AND TIS A CHARITY TO EMPLOY MEN THAT WANT EMPLOYMENT RATHER THAN BEASTS AND SOMETIMES TIS UNSAFE TO TRUST EITHER TO THE WINDS OR TO THE WA TER THE NEEDLE MAKERS WILL NOT TAKE IT WELL THAT NEEDLES SHOULD BE MADE AS EASILY AND CHEAP AS PINS NOR GLASSHOUSES THAT GLASS SHOULD BE MADE MALLEABLE WEARS ARE ARTIFICI AL ROCKS OR STONE WALLS FORMERLY MADE IN GREAT RIVERS TO LEAD OR RAISE A PART OF THE STREAM FOR CORN MILLS WHICH WEARS MUST ALL BE DEMOLISHT BEFORE THE RIVER CAN BE MADE NAVIGABLE SIR YOU SAID VERY WELLTHAT CIDERORCHARDS AND HOUSHOLD GARDENS ARE CONVENIENT ADJUNCTS FOR TRADESMENS GRANARIES N131P796 BUT PERHAPS THE TRUTH OF THAT EXPRESSION EXTENDS 5 T FURTHER848 FURTHER THAN YOU ARE AWARE OF I SHALL EXPLAIN IT BY INSTANCES WHICH ARE HERE APPARENT BEFORE OUR EYES AND DO SEEM TO ME WORTHY TO BE CONSIDERED IN MOST OTHER PARTS OF ENGLAND CI DER YOU KNOW COSTS NO FUEL TO BREW IT AND THE LABOUR IS BUT ONCE IN THE YEAR TIS DRAWN BY DIVINE CHYMISTRY SO MANY TREES SO MANY HUGE ALIMBECKS WHICH ATTEND TO THAT DIVINE WORK CONSTANTLY ALL THE YEAR THEY NEED NO FURNACES TO SEND FORTH A CORRODING SMOAK TO CHOAK ALL THE CITY TO STRANGLE THEM INTO CONSUMPTIONS AND TO CORRUPT ALL BEAUTIES AND AMENITIES NEITHER IRON STEEL OR MARBLE CAN RESIST THE FUMES OF BREWING HOUSES WHEREAS CIDER IS OF A THOUSAND KINDS TIS AS HARD TO NUMBER ALL SORTS OF APPLES AND PEARS AS TO NUMBER ALL SORTS OF GRAPES AND FIGS PROPER TO CURE MANY DISEASES AND A KIND VEHICLE FOR ANY HEALING VEGETABLE OR OTHER MEDICAL MATTERS TO SPEAK MODESTLY AND WITHOUT AN HYPERBOLE THE CIDER OF THE BEST PEPINS DULY RIPENED AND KINDLY FERMENTED IS A PECU LIAR REMEDY FOR THE CONSUMPTION AND GENERALLY ALL STRONG AND PLEASANT CIDER AS WE HAVE HERE EXCITETH AND CLEANSETH THE STOMACH WHICH IF FOUL IS ESTEEMD BY FAMOUS PHYSICIANS THE MOTHER OF ALL DISEASES IT STRENGTHNETH DIGESTION AND INFAL LIBLY FREES THE KIDNEYS AND BLADDER FROM BREEDING THE GRAVEL AND STONE THIS IS ABOVE ALL THE PECULIAR EXCELLENCY OF THE RIGHT REDSTRAKE OF IRCHIN FIELD WHEN IT ESCAPES ALL SOPHISTI CATIONS BUT THAT WHICH MAKES CIDER FITTEST TO ACCOMPANY THE TRADESMENS GRANARY IS THAT IF IT BE MADE OF RIGHT CIDER FRUITS SO THAT IT BE FULL BODIED AND STRONGIT WILL HOLD GOOD WITHOUT DECAY AND WILL YEARLY BE MUCH IMPROVED FOR SOME YEARS TO THE NEXT PLENTIFUL YEAR AS USUALLY IT FALLS OUT AND BEST OF ALL IN LARGE VESSELS THE LARGER THE BETTER TRADES MEN SHOULD NOT BE FOR BOTTLEDCIDER WHICH IS COMMONLY MORE WINDY THAN HEALTHFUL IT HATH BEEN TRIED FROM MY CHILD HOOD IN VESSELS OF 14 15 OR 16 HOGSHEADS OF THE FREE HOU SHOLD MEASURE CONTAINING BETWEEN 60 OR 70 STATUTE GALLONS I HAVE BEEN OFTEN TOLD THAT SIR JOHN WINTER HAD A VESSEL WHICH CONTAINED 30 OR AT LEAST 28 HOGSHEADS SO THAT NOW FOR A FIT MATCH TO A GRANARY AS CIDER INCREASETH HERE WE HAVE NEED TO THINK OF THE GREAT VESSEL AT HEYDELBERG DESCRIBED IN YOUR NUMB 130 P 768 IF IT BE THE SAME VESSEL WHICH WAS MADE BY MICHAEL VERNAINS AND HOLDS GOOD STILL IT MUST BE OF LONG DURANCE FORTHIS COOPER WAS FAMOUS AS I HAVE IT849 IT FROM GOOD AUTHORS FOR MAKING SUCH A HUGE VESSEL FOR PRINCE FREDERICK ELECTPALATINE OF HEYDELBERG AN 1591 AND A FAR GREATER AN 1593 1598 FOR PRINCE HENRY JULIUS DUKE OF BRUNSWICK SIR JOHN WINTERS VESSEL IS SAID TO BE HOOPED WITH PLATES OF IRON THESE WITH TIMBER TO CONCLUDE THIS POINT SOBERLY WHEN THE CITIZENS SHALL ORDINARILY DRINK CIDER WELLDILUTED AS THE FRENCH DRINK WINE AND AS THE SOBER PEOPLE IN ALL OUR CIDERCOUNTREYS DRINK THEIR WASHINGS OF CIDER AS THEY CALL IT AND CIDER WELL DILUTED IN THE GRINDING TIME AND AS THEY DRINK IN LONDON THEIR SIX SHILLING BEER I AM PERSWADED IT WILL MUCH CONDUCE TO THE HEALTH WHICH IS THE LIFE OF THE PEOPLE FOR NON EST VIVERE SED VALERE VITA AND I HAVE OFTEN HEARD LABOURING PEOPLE AFFIRM THAT THEY ARE MORE STRENGTHENED FOR HARD WORK BY CIDER LARGELY DILUTED THAN BY VERY GOOD BEER YET I HAVE MUCH MORE TO SAY SOR HOUSHOLDGARDENS AS A FIT MATCH FOR GRANARIES CATO THE ORACLE OF ROME UNDER TAKES BY COPIOUS INSTANCES IN HIS POSITIVE STYLE THAT COLEWORTS ARE A CURE FOR ALL SORES AND DISEASES HIS UNIVERSAL MEDICINE COLEWORTS AND CABBAGES WITH A LITTLE CARE HOLD OUT SEVEN OR EIGHT MONTHS WE HAVE THEM ALL THE YEAR ROUND GOOD SAUCE FOR BACON AS RED AS ANY ROSE AS THEY HAVE IT IN HEREFORDSHIRE WHERE THE SWINE WILL GET A SHARE OF THE FRUIT WHICH FALL FROM THEIR HEDGES AND THE BACON OF NEW FORREST IS GENERALLY COMMENDED THESE ARE IN GOOD HOUSES ALWAYS AT HAND AND MAY BE EASILY DRESSED WITHOUT WASTE OF MUCH TIME BUT ROOTS OF ALL SORTS RAPES TURNEPS CARROTS PARSNEPS SKIRRETS PO TADOS DO CHALLENGE THE PRECEDENCE BEFORE GRANARIES THEY ARE A KIND OF UNDERGROUND GRANARIES AND DO OFTTIMES HOLD OUT WHEN CORN FAILETH SPECIALLY THE POTADOS OF BARBADOS OR OF VIRGINIA THE POTADOS OF BARBADOS IN OUR FRESH MEMO RY RELIEVED IRELAND FROM TWO YEARS FAMINE WHEN THEIR CORN FAILED THERE AS CHESNUTS RELIEVED FRANCE IN THE EXTREMITY OF THEIR CIVIL WAR WHEN THEIR PLOUGHS WERE FORSAKEN THESE POTADOS COST LITTLE OR NO CULTURE FOR TEN YEARS TOGETHER BE ING ONLY COVERED WITH FERN OR OTHER LIGHT MUCK AND THAT TURND IN WITH THE EARTH AND TWO OR THREE ROOTS AS OFTEN AS THERE IS OCCASION TO TAKE ANY OF THEM UP SOR USE AND THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN UP HERE AND THERE BY SMALL PARCELS WHERE 5 T 2 THEY850 THEY GROW THICKEST A FEW ACRES OF THESE WILL RUN FAR TO FURNISH A CITY AND THE COUNTRY ROUND ABOUT BEFORE AND SINCE YOU GAVE NOTICE OF THEM FROM ME TO THE RSOCIETY THEY HAVE BEEN SOLD IN THE MARKETS OF BRISTOL AND WELLS AT THE PRICE OF FOUR SHILLINGS PER BUSHEL DEAR ENOUGH IN RESPECT OF THE EASIE PROPAGATION AND EASIY CULTURE AND CHEAP ENOUGH IN RESPECT OF THEIR USE CHILDREN OF POOR PEOPLE THEREABOUT EAT THEM RAW INSTEAD OF BREAD AND OTHER FOOD WITHOUT HURT SOME DO ROAST THEM IN EMBERS AS THEY DO WARDENS SOME DO BOYL THEM PEEL THEM AND EAT THEM WITH BUTTER AND PEPPER EITHER SERVED WHOLE OR CHOPT AS THEY DO PARSNEPS SOME DO STRENGTHEN THEIR BEER OR ALE OR MAKE GOOD DRINK WITH THEM SO THEY ARE TO THEM INSTEAD OF CORN AND MALT AND AN ACCEPTABLE TREAT EVERY WAY THEY ARE A STRONG AND WHOLESOM NOURISHMENT FOR LABOURERS SOME DO PARBOYL THEM SLIGHTLY PEEL THEM AND MINCE OR CUT THEM IN SMALL BITS MINGLE THEM WITH SLICES OF FAT FLESH SEASONING ALL TO THEIR PALATE AND BAKE THEM IN PYES OR PASTYES AND THEY E STEEM THEM A RESTORATIVE DELICACY NOT MUCH INFERIOUR TO ARTI CHOCKS ARTICHOCKS WERE ONCE A DAINTY FOR EMPEROURSSAITH MUFFET AND WERE IN HIS REMEMBRANCE SOLD FOR A CROWN APIECE IN ENGLAND NOW THEY ARE CHEAP AND VULGAR IN FRANCE FOR MORE THAN HALF THE YEAR AND ARE EATEN RAW THERE WITH PEPPER AND SALT WHEN NO BIGGER THAN A CLOAKBUTTON OR FRIED IN SWEET OIL OR BUTTER OR DRESSED TO THEIR MIND WHEN THEY COME TO FULL MATURITY SIR HUGH PLATT HATH TAUGHT US HOW TO KEEP RIPEARTICHOCKS GREEN AND FRESH FOR ALL CHRISTMAS IN HIS JEWELHOUSE CHAP 1 AND FOR EASTER IN HIS GLOSET 2 69 SO WE MAY HAVE THEM YOUNG OR RIPE FOR THE WHOLE YEAR ROUND TO RETURN TO POTADOS I OBSERVE THEM TO GROW AND PROSPER ABUNDANTLY IN MUCH DIFFERING KINDS OF SOIL FROM THE NORTH OF SHROPSHIRE TO THE SEA COAST OF DORSETSHIRE BUT THEY LIKE NOT A STIFF AND STRONG LAND I TRIED THEM TWO YEARS IN A STRONG WHEATLAND AND COULD GET NO GOOD OF THEM THERE ALL THE ROOTS WHICH WERE THERE GENERATED WERE LITTLE BIGGER THAN THE BULBS OF SAFFRON IN LIGHT AND HOLLOW LAND OF THE HOTTEST FERMENT WHICH IS COMMONLY OF LITTLE WORTH FOR CORN OR PA STURE THERE POTADOS THRIVE BEST AND TASTE BEST BUT NOW I AM AT A DIFFICULTY WHETHER THE GREAT DIFFERENCE WHICH WE FIND851 FIND IN THE RELISH BE FROM THE DIFFERING KINDS OF THE POTADOS OF BARBADOS AND VIRGINIA OR WHETHER THOSE DIFFER IN KIND FOR BOTH HAVE THE SAME RESEMBLANCE ABOVEGROUND OR WHETHER THE DIFFERENCE WHICH WE FIND BE ONLY FROM THE DIVERSITY OF THE SOYL THAT THE SOYL MAKES A GREAT DIFFERENCE AND THAT ALL MAY BE CAREFUL TO CHUSE A FIT SOYL FOR THEIR GARDENDIET I SHALL HERE OFFER SOME NOTABLE INSTANCES TO PROVE IT ALL THE PEOPLE HERE THE VERY VULGAR DO FIND THE CARROTS AND TURNEPS OR RAPES FROM THE COMMON FIELDS OF MERIOT EIGHT MILES FROM HENCE WESTWARD FAR TO EXCEL OTHER VERY GOOD TURNEPS AND CARROTS IN FATNESS AND PLEASING RELISH AND CABBAGEPLANTS FROM THE WIDE FIELDS OF LYDIARD WESTWARD OF TAUNTON WHERE THEY HAVE A RICH REDDISH SOYL DO SO FAR EXCEL ALL OTHER THE BEST CABBAGE PLANTS THAT THESE LYDIARD PLANTS ARE BOUGHT IN ALL PLACES AT 80 MILES DISTANCE IN THE SPRINGTIME WHEN THE WAYS ARE PRETTY DEEP I SEE MANY HORSES PASS THROUGH THIS TOWN LADEN WITH LYDIARDPLANTS WHICH THEY SELL HERE AND IN ALL TOWN MANY MILES BEYOND SALISBURY ALL CALL FOR LYDIARD PLANTS AND GIVE MORE FOR THEM THAN FOR MANY OTHER THEY BECOME SOONERAND SURERAND SWEETER CABBAGES AND GARDEN PLANTS ARE SOMETIMES MUCH ALTERED IN TASTE AND PROPERTIES BY THE ACCIDENTS OF THE YEAR IN A DROUGHTY SUMMER THE PLAGUE THEN BEING HOT IN LONDON WE HAD CARROTS IN NORTHAMPTONSHIRE FROM A KIND SOYL WERE THEY WERE WONT TO BE VERY GOOD BUT THEN SO RANK DRY AND EARTHY THAT WE COULD NOT ENDURE TOSEE THEM ON THE TABLE I HEAR THAT THE TURNEPS OF HACKNEY ARE BETTER THAN OTHER TURNEPS ABOUT LONDON WE HAVE HERE VERY GOOD TURNEPS WHITE AND YELLOW WHICH ARE FATTER AND ESTEEMED MORE RESTORA TIVE BUT ALL ENGLAND WANTS THE BOHEMIAN TURNEPS BLOOD RED ON THE CUTSIDE WHICH ARE EXTOLD BY MUFFET AS HE FOUND THEM IN PRAGUE TO BE SO RESTORATIVE AND DELICATE THAT THE EM PEROUR HIMSELF NURSETH THEM IN HIS GARDEN THESE ARGUMENTS I PRODUCE TO INVITE THEM THAT HAVE THE KINDEST SOYL FOR THESE UNDERGROUND GRANARIES POTADOS AND TURNEPS TO GET THEM IM MEDIATELY FROM BARBADOS JAMAICA AND PRAGUE BY MERCHANTS AT THE FIRST HAND BEFORE THEY BE DEGRADEDOR ANY WAYS VITIATED BY MORE UNKIND SOYL AND SINCE THERE IS A PECULIAR SORT OF BLACK852 BLACK MULBERRIES WHICH DO FAR EXCEL THE REST FOR OUR JUNKETSAS ALL OUR OLD BOOKS TELL US ALL ALONG DOWN TILL WITHIN THESE 1200 YEARS WE MUST SEND FOR THEM TO NAPLES OR SICILY OR TO PERSIA WHENCE OUR SILK TRADE CAME THE WHITE MULBERRIES AS WE CALL THEM ARE FOR THE FINEST SILK THE SPANISH POTADO REQUIRES DILIGENT CULTURE MUCH SUNAND A LIGHT AND PREGNANT GARDENSOYL IN THE MODERN LATIN THE ARE CALLED GLANDES MALACENSES BEING BROUGHT INTO SPAIN FROM VOLEZ MALAGA A PROVINCE IN AMERICA THEY REPORT THAT MORE THAN A DOZEN OF THEIR HUGE SPANISH SHIPS WERE BROUGHT AT ONE TIME TO SEVIL IN SPAIN FULLY FRAIGHTED WITH THESE POTADOS AND WERE SOON DISPERSED ALL OVER SPAIN WE SAY THE SPANIARD IS SLOW AT EVERY THING BUT THEY MAY SAY THE ENGLISHMAN IN MANY PARTS OF ENGLAND IS MORE SLOW AT THE BEST IMPROVEMENTS OF OUR OWN COUNTRY WITNESS OUR WANT OF VINEYARDS OF GROVES OF MULBERRIES OF THE BEST CHESTNUTS WALL NUTS FIGS ALMONDS WHICH ARE WANTING IN MOST PARTS AND DO NOT REFUSE TO GROW IN OUR CLIMATE MR HUGHES IN HIS AMERICAN PHYSICIAN SAITH THE PORADOS OF JAMAICA AND OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS BARBADOS C DO MUCH EXCEED SPANISH POTADOS AND ARE THE BEST THE MOST WHOLESOM AND DELICIOUS ROOT IN THE WHOLE WORLD THAT SOME OF THE ROOTS ARE YELLOWISH OR OF A GOLDEN COLOUR SOME WHITE WE WISH AGAIN THAT WE HAD THEM OF ALL SORTS AT THE FIRST HAND TO BE TRIED IN LIGHT AND QUICK LAND A LITLE SHELVING TOWARDS THE SOUTH MUSHROMS AND THE TUBERES OR TUBERA FROM LIBYA WERE THE CHOICEST DELICACIES OF ROME FOR MANY AGES BUT I AM NOT AT LEISURE TO SERVE LUXURY YET TIS BETTER WE SHOULD HAVE THE BEST AT HOME THAN BE ALWAYS AT THE CHARGES TO SEND FOR THEM AND TIS PROBABLE THAT OUR OWN NATIVE SOYL WILL MAKE THEM WHOLSOM FOR ENGLISHMEN

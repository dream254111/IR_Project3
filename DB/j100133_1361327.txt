the whichi we sometimes mneasure our Cooper progress and since the Cooper Orni Club thological Club hlas grown t0 be one of the leading factors in Californian ornithoogy and its advancement it is interesting to note its growth which has been unfailingly steady during the past few years The organization of the club dates back to June 1893 when four young ornithologists conceived the idea of forming a Club which was done and as with similar small organizations its life was several times in tile balance but througli the energy of its promotors it finally gained a secure foot hold and began its growth whiicli later devel ients have shown iwas destined to result in the collecting into one associationof almost the entire ornithological strengthl of Califorua Its first four years of existence was miarked byv a wavering grovtll according to the efforts put forth by its nlemblers to interest otlhers in the work and January 1898 showed a total enrolllment of 77 members The books of the secretary since that date give forthi the follow ing interesting figures Membership January 189S  New members added  7 Members dropped  Net gain for 1898q o Menmbership January 1899  77 Nembr

increase for 19oo with the year but threefourths gone is something more than 20 per cent of the total membership When it is remembered that the ornithologists of California are more or less widely scattered one may appreciate the wide field which is covered by the Cooper Club membership A provision of the Clubs constitution that a member must be a bona fide resident of the state at the time of election has brought into the Club only those who are actively engaged in ornithological research Owing to its late receipt we are obliged to omit an excellent photograph of the nest and eggs of Clarkes Nutcracker by Mr W H Parker which should have illustrated his paper in this issue This will be published separately in an early issue of THvE CONDOR It is now reasonably certain that by the next session of the California State Legislature the Cooper Ornithological Club through its able member Senator Edw K Taylor of Alameda will have prepared a sweeping bird protection bill for the consideration of Californias law makers Senator Taylor himself an able attorney is in a position to judge of the con stitutionality of various protective laws and to model the proposed bill so that it may be with out flaw when it is presented for consideration The forceful paper presented by Mr Rey nolds before the Southern Division on Facts and the Use We Make of Them will prove a thrust to many workers who have perhaps never doubted the value of the scientific work they are pursuing There is undoubtedly mluch field work done each year which is prac tically valueless insofar as it affects the sum total of our knowledge specimens are amassed with little or no attemipt at investigation Mr Reynolds points out that in engaging in such work the student is not employing his time to the best advantage and the ideal line of work suggested by Mr Reynolds will bear careful reading Thie Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture has issued Circulars Nos 28 and 29 dealing with the protecton and importation of birds as directed in the Lacey Act which was approved by Congress May 25 last The termls of this act placed the s preservationl dis tribution introduction and restoration of game and other birds under the Departmaent of Ag riculture and Secretary Wilson has in turn given the matter into the charge of the Bio logical Survey and correspondence should be addressed to the Chief of the Survey Parties contemnplating the interstate shipulent of wild birds or others should famniliarize themseles with the tete t of this act as in tiany cases sucha sh ipments heretofore unprohibitetd become violations of the law Circulars and infornia tion are furnished by the Biological Survey tupon application H R Taylor associate editor of Till CON iDOR was one of the successftil

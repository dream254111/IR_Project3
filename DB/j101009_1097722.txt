J101009,THE VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER,1097722,MISCELLANY,I245878,MISCETTANY MISCT T A NY IN THE REPORT OF THE CASE OF WATSON V BLACKSTONE 6 VA LAW REG 417 THE NAMES OF COUNSEL WERE INADVERTENTLY OMITTED MESSRS CAUSEY JONES  WOOD WARD AND 0 D BACHELOR REPRESENTED THE PLAINTIFFS AND MESSRS R M LETT AND JOHN W FRIEND THE DEFENDANTS DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN IN POLICE REGULATIONSTHERE ARE MANY ORDINANCES AIMED AT THE PREVENTION OF IMMORALITY WHICH APPLY TO WOMEN ONLY OR WHICH CLEARLY DISCRIMINATE AGAINST WOMEN IN THEIR PROVISIONS THE CONSTITUTION ALITY OF SUCH DISCRIMINATION HAS RARELY BEEN RAISED IN THE COURTS SUCH ORDINANCES HAVE SOMETIMES BEEN ATTACKED ON THE GROUND OF INTERFERING WITH LIBERTY BUT RARELY ON THE GROUND OF DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN THE SEXES IN A FEW CASES HOWEVER STATUTES AND ORDINANCES HAVE BEEN ASSAILED ON THE GROUND THAT THEY MAKE AN UNCON STITUTIONAL DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN STATUTES EXCLUDING WOMEN FROM THE BUSINESS OF SELLING INTOXICATING LIQUORS BY AUTHORIZING LICENSES TO MEN ONLY HAVE BEEN UPHELD STATUTES AND ORDINANCES MAKING IT UNLAWFUL FOR ANY PERSON TO SELL LIQUORS IN ANY PLACE WHERE WOMEN ARE EMPLOYED AND ORDINANCES MAKING IT UNLAW FUL TO EMPLOY WOMEN IN SUCH A PLACE OR TO BE THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN SUSTAINED THESE DECISIONS HAVE RESTED ON THE GROUND THAT THERE WERE SPECIAL REASONS FOR THE DISCRIMINATIONTHAT THE PRESENCE OF WOMEN AT SUCH PLACES WAS LIKELY TO RESULT IN GROSS IMMORALITY THE ONLY DIFFICULTY THAT THE COURTS HAVE FOUND IN UPHOLDING PROVISIONS OF THIS KIND HAS ARISEN UNDER THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION PROVIDING THAT NO PERSON SHALL ON ACCOUNT OF SEX BE DISQUALIFIED FROM ENGAGING IN ANY LAW FUL BUSINESS VOCATION OR PROFESSION UNDER THAT PROVISION IT WAS HELD THAT A WOMAN COULD NOT BE PROHIBITED BY ORDINANCE FROM BEING A WAITRESS IN A BARROOM AN OTHER CLASS OF CASES IN WHICH ORDINANCES HAVE BEEN HELD INVALID FOR INFRINGING ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF WOMEN TO PERSONAL LIBERTY HAVE INVOLVED DISCRIMINA TION AGAINST WOMEN BUT HAVE NOT TURNED UPON THE QUESTION OF DISCRIMINATION THESE HAVE INVOLVED ORDINANCES REGULATING THE CONDUCT OF LEWD WOMEN SOME OF THEM LIKE THAT OF DUNN V CORN KY 43 L R A 701 HAVE UPHELD ORDINANCES KEEPING SUCH WOMEN OFF THE STREETS DURING THE HOURS OF NIGHT BUT OTHER ORDI NANCES HAVE GONE BEYOND REASONABLE REGULATION OF CONDUCT AND HAVE ATTEMPTED PRACTICALLY TO PROSCRIBE OUTLAW OR EXILE ALL WOMEN KNOWN TO BE DISREPUTABLE THUS THE CASE OF HECKINGER V MAYSVILLE KY 49 L R A 114 HOLDS THAT AN ORDINANCE MAKING IT UNLAWFUL TO ASSOCIATE ESCORT CONVERSE OR LOITER WITH ANY SUCH WOMAN EITHER BY DAY OR BY NIGHT UPON ANY OF THE STREETS OR ALLEYS OF THE CITY EXCEPT FOR HER HUSBAND FATHER BROTHER OR OTHER MALE RELATIVE IS INVALID BOTH BECAUSE ANY PERSON SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO CONVERSE WITH HER LONG ENOUGH TO TRANSACT ANY NECESSARY AND LEGITIMATE BUSINESS AND ALSO BECAUSE OF ITS UNREASON ABLE DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN THE PERSONS WHO MAY SPEAK TO HER AND THOSE WHO MAY NOT A TYPE OF ANOTHER CLASS OF CASES IS GASTINEAU V COM KY 49 L R A 111 HOLDING THAT AN ORDINANCE IS VOID WHEN IT MAKES IT UNLAWFUL FOR ANY WOMAN TO GO INTO OR TO STAND WITHIN FIFTY FEET OF ANY BUILDING WHERE INTOXICATING LIQUOR IS SOLD SINCE THIS IS AN UNNECESSARY INTERFERENCE WITH INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY 1900 579580 6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER DEC IT IS SOMEWHAT STRANGE THAT THE ELEMENT OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN HAS NOT BEEN MORE DISCUSSED IN THIS CLASS OF CASES BUT IT SEEMS TO BE ENTIRELY REASON ABLE TO SAY THAT ORDINANCES AIMED AGAINST WOMEN OF THIS CLASS OR WHICH MAKE PRO VISIONS AS TO THEM WHICH ARE NOT EQUALLY APPLICABLE TO MEN MAY NEVERTHELESS BE CONSTITUTIONAL THAT IS TO SAY THE DISCRIMINATION MAY NOT BE UNJUST BUT MAY BE ENTIRELY JUSTIFIED BY THE NECESSITIES OF THE CASE AND BY THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RELATIONS OF WOMEN AND MEN TO THE PROBLEM INVOLVED CLASSIFICATION OF SUCH WO MEN IN POLICE REGULATIONS WHICH DO NOT APPLY TO MEN MAY BE HELD CONSTITUTIONAL SO FAR AS IT IS BASED UPON THE ESSENTIALLY DIFFERENT RELATION WHICH THEY SUSTAIN TO THE EVIL TO BE REMEDIEDCASE AND COMMENT MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONSORDINANCES CURFEW LAWWE ARE PER MITTED TO PRINT BELOW AN OPINION RECENTLY RENDERED BY HON H R POLLARD AS CITY ATTORNEY FOR THE CITY OF RICHMOND ON THE SUBJECTS OF THE SOCALLED CURFEW ORDINANCESORDINANCES FORBIDDING CHILDREN OF TENDER YEARS TO GO UPON THE STREETS AT NIGHT AFTER CERTAIN HOURS COMMITTEE ON ORDINANCES OF THE CITY COUNCIL GENTLEMENBY YOUR REQUEST I HAVE HAD UNDER CONSIDERATION THE QUESTION OF THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF A PROPOSED ORDINANCE ENTITLED AN ORDINANCE PROHIBITING CHILDREN UNDER 15 YEARS OF AGE FROM GOING ON THE STREETS ALLEYS OR PUBLIC PLACES IN THE CITY OF RICHMOND AT NIGHT AFTER CERTAIN HOURS AND IN RESPONSE I BEG TO MAKE THE FOLLOWING REPORT  IT IS UNDOUBTEDLY TRUE THAT UNLESS THE POWER TO PASS THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE HAS BEEN CONFERRED UPON THE CITY COUNCIL EITHER BY A GENERAL STATUTE OR BY THE CHARTER OF THE CITY OF RICHMOND THE POWER DOES NOT EXIST BY SECTION 1038 OF THE CODE THE COUNCILS OF EVERY CITY AND TOWN IN THE COMMONWEALTH ARE VESTED WITH THE POWER TO PASS ALL ORDINANCES NECESSARY  TO PRESERVE PEACE AND GOOD ORDER AND BY SECTION 9 OF THE CHARTER OF THE CITY OF RICHMOND IT IS PROVIDED THAT THE CITY COUNCIL SHALL HAVE THE POWER TO MAKE SUCH ORDINANCES BYLAWS ORDERS AND REGULA TIONS AS THEY MAY DEEM DESIRABLE TO CARRY OUT CERTAIN ENUMERATED POWERS WHICH ARE VESTED IN THEM AND AMONG THESE BY SUBSECTION 24 IS THE POWER TO PREVENT VICE AND IMMORALITY TO PRESERVE PUBLIC PEACE AND GOOD ORDER I AM OF OPINION THAT UNDER THE GENERAL STATUTE ABOVE REFERRED TOCERTAINLY UNDER THE CHARTER OF THE CITYTHE POWER TO PASS THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE WAS IN TENDED TO BE CONFERRED UPON THE CITY COUNCIL AND UNLESS THERE IS SOME CONSTITU TIONAL INHIBITION AGAINST THE CONFERRING OF SUCH POWER THEN THE ORDINANCE MAY BE LEGALLY ADOPTED IN THE EXERCISE OF THIS POWER THE CITY IS UNDOUBTEDLY EXERCISING WHAT IS KNOWN IN THE TEXTBOOKS AS THE POLICE POWER THE EXTENT OF AND LIMITATION UPON THE POLICE POWERS OF A STATE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED BY MANY LAW WRITERS AND IN MANY ADJUDICATED CASES IN SPEAKING OF THE POLICE POWERS OF THE STATE MR COOLEY SAYS THE POLICE OF A STATE IN A COMPREHENSIVE SENSE EMBRACES ITS WHOLE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL REGULATION BY WHICH THE STATE SEEKS NOT ONLY TO PRESERVE THE PUBLIC ORDER AND TO PREVENT OFFENCES AGAINST THE STATE BUT ALSO TO ESTABLISH FOR THE INTER COURSE OF CITIZENS WITH CITIZENS THOSE RULES OF GOOD MANNERS AND GOOD NEIGHBOR HOOD WHICH ARE CALCULATED TO PREVENT A CONFLICT OF RIGHTS AND TO INSURE TO EACH THE UNINTERRUPTED ENJOYMENT OF HIS OWN SO FAR AS IS REASONABLY CONSISTENT WITH A LIKE1900 XMSCTLTANY 581 ENJOYMENT OF RIGHTS BY OTHERS BLACKSTONE DEFINES IT TO BE  THE DUE REGULATION AND DOMESTIC ORDER OF THE KINGDOM WHEREBY THE INHABITANTS OF A STATE LIKE MEM BERS OF A WELLGOVERNED FAMILY ARE BOUND TO CONFORM THEIR GENERAL BEHAVIOR TO THE RULES OF PROPRIETY GOOD NEIGHBORHOOD AND GOOD MANNERS AND TO BE DECENT IN DUSTRIOUS AND INOFFENSIVE IN THEIR RESPECTIVE STATIONS COOLEY ON CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS PAGE 704 4 BLACKSTONES COMMENTARIES 162 IN SPEAKING OF THE DIFFICULTY IN DEFINING THE EXTENT OF THE POLICE POWER IN STONE V MISSISSIPPI 101 U S 814 IT WAS SAID  MANY ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN THIS COURT AND ELSEWHERE TO DEFINE THE POLICE POWER BUT NEVER WITH ENTIRE SUCCESS IT IS ALWAYS EASIER TO DETERMINE WHETHER A PARTICULAR CASE COMES WITHIN THE GENERAL SCOPE OF THE POWER THAN TO GIVE AN ABSTRACT DEFINITION OF THE POWER ITSELF WHICH WILL BE IN ALL RESPECTS ACCURATE WHILE EVERY CITIZEN HAS THE CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTY OF LIFE LIBERTY AND ENJOY MENT OF HIS PROPERTY AND THEY CANNOT BE TAKEN AWAY FROM HIM EXCEPT BY DUE PROCESS OF LAW YET SOCIAL AND CONVENTIONAL RIGHTS ARE HOWEVER SUBJECT TO REASON ABLE LIMITATIONS IN THEIR ENJOYMENT SUCH LIMITATIONS AS WILL PREVENT THEM FROM BEING DANGEROUS AND HURTFUL TO THE BODY POLITIC AND THE LAWMAKING DEPARTMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT UNDER THE POWER VESTED IN IT BY THE CONSTITUTION CAN ENACT LAWS PROVIDING FOR SUCH REASONABLE RESTRAINTS AND REGULATIONS AS ARE NECESSARY AND EXPEDIENT TO SECURE SOCIAL ORDER AND PUBLIC MORALS MR COOLEY THE MOST APPROVED WRITER ON CONSTITUTIONAL LAW SAYS IT IS SUFFICIENT FOR US TO HAVE POINTED OUT THAT IN ADDITION TO THE POWER TO PUNISH MISDEMEANORS AND FELONIES THE STATE HAS ALSO THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE EXTENSIVE AND VARIED REGU LATIONS AS TO THE TIME MODE AND CIRCUMSTANCES IN AND UNDER WHICH PARTIES SHALL ASSERT ENJOY OR EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS WITHOUT COMING IN CONFLICT WITH ANY OF THOSE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES WHICH ARE ESTABLISHED FOR THE PROTECTION OF PRIVATE RIGHTS OR PRIVATE PROPERTY COOLEY ON CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS PAGE 745 IN SPEAKING OF THE EXTENT OF THE POWER AND APPLYING IT TO SPECIFIC CASES IT WAS SAID BY PAYNTER J IN DUNN V COMMONWEALTH COURT OF APPEALS OF KENTUCKY MARCH 3 1899 43 L R A 701 THAT  IT HAS BEEN HELD BY COURTS THAT UNDER THE POLICE POWER MUNICIPALITIES CAN REGULATE THE HEIGHT OF BUILDINGS IN CITIES PRE SCRIBE THE STREETS UPON WHICH PERSONS DRIVING A CERTAIN CLASS OF VEHICLES SHALL TRAVEL AND PROHIBIT THEM FROM TRAVELLING UPON OTHER STREETS AND REGULATE THE HOURS AT WHICH PUBLIC PLACES PLACES OF AMUSEMENT AND SALOONS SHALL BE CLOSED THE LEGISLATURES OF THE STATES CAN ENACT LAWS TO REGULATE THE EMPLOYMENT OF CHIL DREN OF CERTAIN AGES AND PROHIBIT WOMEN FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN KINDS OF EMPLOYMENT IT HAS BEEN HELD BY SOME COURTS THAT A PENALTY CAN BE IMPOSED UPON LIVERYSTABLE KEEPERS FOR GIVING CREDIT TO PUPILS WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE COLLEGE AUTHORITIES IT HAS BEEN HELD TO PROTECT LABORERS AGAINST OPPRESSION OF THEIR EMPLOYERS THAT IT IS COMPETENT TO FORBID THEM BEING PAID ANYTHING EXCEPT LEGAL TENDER FUNDS IN BRADDEY V MILLEDGEVILLE 74 GA 516 IT WAS HELD THAT A CITY MAY ENFORCE AN ORDINANCE PUNISHING STREETWALKERS FOR LOITERING ABOUT THE STREETS OR STORES AT NIGHT IN THE CASE OF OCOWLEY V CHRISTENSEN 137 U S 66 MR JUSTICE FIELD SPEAKING UPON THE SUBJECT OF WHAT LIMITATION MAY BE PUT UPON THE ENJOYMENT OF RIGHTS GUARANTEED BY THE CONSTITUTION USES THIS LANGUAGE THE POSSESSION AND ENJOY MENT OF ALL RIGHTS ARE SUBJECT TO SUCH REASONABLE CONDITIONS AS MAY BE DEEMED BY582 6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER DEC THE GOVERNING AUTHORITY OF THE COUNTRY ESSENTIAL TO THE SAFETY HEALTH PEACE GOOD ORDER AND MORALS OF THE COMMUNITY APPARENTLY THERE ARE CASES WHICH CONFLICT WITH THESE PRINCIPLES THUS ENUNCIATED BY TEXTWRITERS AND COURTS AND WHICH HOLD THAT SIMILAR ORDINANCES TO THE ONE PROPOSED IMPOSE UNREASONABLE RESTRAINT UPON THE RIGHTS OF CITIZENS AMONG THESE THE MOST PERTINENT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND IS THE CASE EX PARTE MCCARVER TEX 46 S W 936 WHERE A CURFEW ORDINANCE PROLLIBITING PERSONS UNDER 21 YEARS OF AGE FROM BEING ON THE STREETS AFTER 9 OCLOCK IN THE EVENING UNLESS WITH A PARENT OR GUARDIAN OR IN SEARCH OF A PHYSICIAN WAS HELD TO BE AN UNREASONABLE EXERCISE OF THE GENERAL POWERS OF THE CITY TO PRESERVE THE PUBLIC PEACE AND TO PROTECT THE GOOD ORDER AND MORALS OF THE COMMUNITY IT IS TO BE OBSERVED IN REFERENCE TO THAT CASE AND THE ORDINANCE THERE UNDER REVIEW THAT THE AGE LIMIT WAS PLACED AT 21 YEARS WHEREAS UNDER THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE HERE THE AGE LIMIT IS 15 YEARS THE ORDINANCE THERE WAS PROPOSED TO BE PASSED IN A SMALL TOWN CONTAINING A POP ULATION OF LESS THAN 10000 WHILE HERE IT IS PROPOSED TO BE ADOPTED FOR A POPULA TION OF ABOUT 100000 ALL OF THE CASES MAKE THE QUESTION OF THE VALIDITY OF THE ORDINANCE TURN ON THE QUESTION OF ITS REASONABLENESS OUR OWN SUPREME COURT OF APPEALS SPEAKING ON THIS SUBJECT HAS RECENTLY SAID IN THE CASE OF WASHINGTON ETC RUILWNY COMPANY V CITY OUNCIL VIRGINIA SUPREME COURT REPORTER VOLUME 2 PAGE 315 THAT IN DETERMINING THIS QUESTION THE COURT WILL REGARD ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE PARTICULAR CITY OR CORPORATION THE OBJECTS SOUGHT TO BE ATTAINED AND THE NECESSITY WHICH EXISTS FOR THE ORDINANCE REGULATIONS PROPER FOR A LARGE AND PROSPEROUS CITY MIGHT BE ABSURD OR OPPRESS IVE IN A SMALL AND SPARSELY POPULATED TOWN OR IN THE COUNTRY IF THEREFORE THE VALIDITY OF THE ORDINANCE EVER COMES UNDER REVIEW IN THE COURT IT WILL BECOME NECESSARY NOT ONLY TO LOOK AT THE ORDINANCE ITSELF BUT TO CONSIDER THE CONDITIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SEEM TO DEMAND THE PROPOSED LEGISLATTEN IF THE CIRCUM STANCES ARE SHOWN TO BE SUCH AS ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF YOUR COMMITTEE STATED TO ME WERE SLOWN TO THE COMMITTEE TO EXIST DEMANDING THIS LEGISLATION IT SEEMS TO ME BUT ONE ANSWER COULD BE MADE ON THE QUESTION OF THE REASONABLENESS OF THE ORDINANCE I AM THEREFORE CLEARLY OF OPINION THAT IF THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE BE PASSED NO COURT WOULD BE JUSTIFIED UNDER THE CONSTITUTION AND LAWS OF THE LAND IN DECLARING IT ILLEGAL OR INVALID THE ORDINANCE SEEMS TO BE CAREFULLY DRAWN AND IN MY OPINION CLEARLY AND FULLY MEETS THE OBJECT HAD IN VIEW

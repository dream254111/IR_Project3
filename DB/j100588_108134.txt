SINGULAR ANIMALS AND CONFIRMING THEIR AFFINITY WITH THE CRUSTACEA,I206990, 355  XX DISCOVERY OF THE METAMORPHOSIS IN THE SECOND TYPE OF THE CIRRIPEDES VIZ THE LEPADES COMPLETING THE NATURAL HISTORY OF THESE SINGULAR ANIMALS AND CON FIRMING THEIR AFFINITY WITH THE CRUSTACEA BY J V THOMPSON FLS DEPUTY INSPECTORGENERAL OF HOSPITALS COMMUNICATED BY SIR JAMES MACGRIGOR BART MD FRS RECEIVED JANUARY 3READ MARCH 5 1835 THE FOURTH MEMOIR PUBLISHED IN MY ZOOLOGICAL RESEARCHES AND ILLUSTRATIONS NO III PAGE 69 C HAVING FIRST MADE KNOWN THE REAL NATURE OF THE CIRRIPEDES THE KEY OF WHICH REMAINED CONCEALED IN THEIR METAMORPHOSIS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED THAT SOME NATURALIST FAVOURABLY SITUATED TO INVESTIGATE THE OCEANIC TRIBE OF THESE ANIMALS WOULLD HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TO MAKE THE SAME DISCOVERY IN REGARD TO THESE AND THEREBY COMPLETE THEIR NATURAL HISTORY IT WAS SCARCELY TO BE EXPECTED THAT THE HONOUR OF THIS DISCOVERY ALSO SHOULD BE RESERVED FOR TLLE AUTHOR FIXED TO ONE SPOT WHERE NONE OF THEM NATURALLY EXIST AND ARE BUT CASUALLY THROWN UPON OUR SHORES BY THE WAVES OF THE ATLANTIC ATTACHED TO PIECES OF WRECK OR BROUGHT INTO PORT FIXED TO THE BOTTOMS OF SHIPS RETURNING FROM DISTANT VOYAGES FORTUNATELY HOWEVER TWO SHIPS OF THIS DESCRIPTION CAME INTO THIS HARBOUR CORK ONE FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN THE OTHER FROM NORTH AMERICA WHICH NOT BEING SHEATHED WITH COPPER HAD THEIR BOT TOMS LITERALLY COVERED WITH BARNACLES OF THE THREE GENERA OF LEPAS CINERAS AND OTION AND HAVING PERSONS EMPLOYED EXPRESSLY FOR THE PURPOSE NUMBERS OF THESE WERE BROUGHT ALIVE IN SEA WATER AMONGST WHICH WERE MANY WITH THE OVA IN VARIOUS STAGES OF THEIR PROGRESS AND SOME READY TO HATCH WHICH THEY EVENTUALLY DID IN PRODIGIOUS NUMBERS SO AS TO ENABLE HIM TO ADD THE PROOF OF THEIR BEING LIKE THE BALANI NATATORY CRUSTA CEA IN THEIR FIRST STAGE BUT OF A TOTALLY DIFFERENT FACIES AND STRUCTURE A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH DETERMINES THE PROPRIETY OF THE SEPARATION OF THE CIRRIPEDES INTO TWO TRIBES AND EVINCES THE SAGACITY OF MR MACLEAY IN BEING THE FIRST TO INDICATE THAT THESE TWO TRIBES THE BALANI AND LEPADES WERE NOT SO CLOSELY RELATED AS GENERALLY SUPPOSED  THE LARVAE OF THE BALANI DESCRIBED IN MEMOIR IV UNDER THE EXTERNAL APPEARANCE OF THE BIVALVE MONOCULI ASTRACODA HAVE A PAIR OF PEDUNCULATED EYES MORE NUMEROUS AND MORE CORMPPLETELY DEVELOPED MEMBERS APPROXITNATING TO THOSE OF CYCLOPS AND OF THE PERFECT TRITON WHILE IN THE PRESENT TYPE OR LEPADES THE LARVA RESEMBLES SOME WHAT THAT OF THE CYCLOPS WHICH MULLER MISTAKING FOR A PERFECT ANIMAL NAMED AMY MONE AND WHICH CAN BE SHOWN TO BE COMMON TO A GREAT MANY OF THE ENTOMOSTRACA  SEE HORAE ENTOMOLOGICAMR THOMPSON ON THE METAMORPHOSIS OR THE RESEMBLANLCE IS STILL MORE STRIKING TO THAT OF THE ARGULUS ARMIGER OF LATREILLE WHICH IN FACT IS BUT AN AMYMONE FURNISHED WITH A TRICUSPIDATE SHIELD AT THE BACK THE GENUS CINERAS WAS THE FIRST IN WHICH THE LARVAE WERE OBSERVED TO HATCH JULY 27 THREE DAYS AFTER THE ARRIVAL OF THE SHIP THEN IN LEPAS ANSERIFERA AUGUST 19 AND A FEW DAYS LATER IN LEPAS DENTATA IN ALL OF WHICH THERE IS A PERFECT ACCORDANCE WITH VERY SLIGHT DIFFERENCES WHICH PROBABLY RESULTED FROM THE MORE OR LESS PERFECT DEVELOP MENT OF THE LARVA THE VERY REMARKABLE AND BEAUTIFUL ONE OF LEPAS ANSERIFERA MAY BE REGARDED AS THE PERFECT TYPE TO WHICH ALL THE OTHERS ARE TO BE REFERRED FIG 5 IN THE WHOLE OF THIS TRIBE OF THE CIRRIPEDES THE OVA AFTER EXPULSION FROM THE OVA RIUM APPEAR TO BE CONVEYED BY THE OVIPOSITOR INTO THE CELLULAR TEXTURE OF THE PEDICLE JUST BENEATH THE BODY OF THE ANIMAL WHICH THEY FILL TO THE DISTANCE OF ABOUT AN INCH WHEN FIRST PLACED IN THIS SITUATION THEY SEEM TO BE AMORPHOUS AND INSEPARABLE FROM THE PULPY SUBSTANCE IN WHICH THEY ARE IMBEDDED BUT AS THEY APPROACH TO MA TURITY THEY BECOME OF AN OVAL SHAPE POINTED AT BOTH ENDS AND ARE EASILY DETACHED SIR EVERARD HOME HAS GIVEN A VERY GOOD REPRESENTATION OF THEM AT THIS STAGE OF THEIR PROGRESS IN HIS LECTURES ON COMPARATIVE ANATOMY FROM THE ELEGANT PENCIL OF MR BAUER DURING THE STAY OF THE OVA IN THE PEDICLE THEY RENDER THIS PART MORE OPAKE AND OF A BLUEISH TINT THE OVA THEMSELVES AND THE CELLULAR TEXTURE WITH WHICH THEY ARE SUR ROUNDED BEING OF A PALE OR AZURE BLUE COLOUR IT IS DIFFICULT TO CONCEIVE IN WHAT MANNER THE OVA ARE EXTRICATED FROM THE SITUATION ABOVE INDICATED BUT IT IS CERTAINLY NOT BY THE MEANS SUGGESTED BY SIR EVERARD HOME IN THE ABOVEMENTIONED LECTURE VIZ BY PIERCING OUTWARDS THROUGH THE MEMBRANES OF THE PEDICLE FOR THE OVA ARE SUB SEQUENTLY FOUND FORMING A PAIR OF LEAFLIKE EXPANSIONS PLACED BETWEEN EITHER SIDE OF THE BODY OF THE ANIMAL AND THE LINING MEMBRANE OF THE SHELLS IN LEPAS FIG 1 OR OF THE LEATHERY INTERNAL TUNIC IN CINERAS THESE LEAVES HAVE EACH A SEPARATE ATTACHMENT AT THE SIDES OF THE ANIMAL TO THE SEPTUM WHICH DIVIDES THE CAVITY OCCUPIED BY THE ANIMAL FROM THAT OF THE PEDICLE THEY ARE AT FIRST COMPARATIVELY SMALL HAVE A ROUNDED OUTLINE AND POSSESS THE SAME BLUEISH COLOUR WHICH THE OVA HAD IN THE PEDICLE BUT AS THE OVA ADVANCE IN PROGRESS THESE LEAVES EXTEND IN EVERY DIMENSION AND LAP OVER EACH OTHER ON THE BACK PASSING THROUGH VARIOUS LIGHTER SHADES OF COLOUR INTO PALE PINK AND FINALLY WHEN READY TO HATCH BECOME NEARLY WHITE FIG 2 THESE LEAVES APPEAR TO BE COMPOSED OF A LAYER OF OVA IRREGULARLY PLACED AND IMBEDDED IN A KIND OF PARENCHYMATOUS TEXTURE OUT OF WHICH THEY READILY FALL WHEN ABOUT TO HATCH ON ITS SUBSTANCE BEING TORN ASUNDER INDEED IT APPEARS AT LENGTH TO BECOME SO TENDER AS TO FALL ENTIRELY AWAY SO THAT AFTER THE PERIOD OF GESTATION IS PAST NO VESTIGE OF THESE LEAFY CONCEPTACLES IS TO BE FOUND WHEN THE LARVAE BARELY VISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE BURST FORTH FROM THE OVA THEIR DEVELOPMENT GOES ON WITH SUCH RAPIDITY THAT THEY SEENI TO GROW SENSIBLY WHILE UNDER OBSERVATION THESE CHANGES HAVE BEEN DEPICTED IN CINERAS AT FIGG 6 7  8 WHICH 356IN THE SECOND TYPE OF THE CIRRIPEDES LAST PROBABLY DID NOT POSSESS SUFFICIENT VITALITY TO PASS INTO THE NEXT STAGE SUCH AS WE SEE THAT OF LEPAS ANSERIFERA FIG 5 THE LARVA OF THE LEPADES THEN IS A TAILED MONOCULUS WITH THREE PAIRS OF MEMBERS THE MOST ANTERIOR OF WHICH ARE SIMPLE THE OTHERS BIFID HAVING ITS BACK COVERED BY AN AMPLE SHIELD TERMINATING ANTERIORLY IN TWO EXTENDED HORNS AND POSTERIORLY IN A SINGLE ELONGATED SPINOUS PROCESS IT MUST EVER REMAIN UNCERTAIN HOW LONG THE LARVAE OF THE LEPADES REMNAIN IN THEIR FIRST OR FREE STATE BUT IT IS PROBABLY FOR A LONGER OR SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME ACCORDING AS THEY SOONER OR LATER MEET WITH A SUBSTANCE ADAPTED TO THEIR RESPECTIVE HABITS THUS THOSE OF THE LEPAS FASCICULARIS ATTACH THEMSELVES IN PREFERENCE TO GULFWEED OR FLOATING FUCI LEPAS MINIMA TO SLENDER SPECIES OF ANTIPATHES LEPAS ANSERIFERAT AND DENTATA CINERAS VITTATUS AND OTION TO THE BOTTOMS OF SHIPS LEPAS ANATIFERAT TO FLOATING TIMBER AND TO ONE ANOTHER WHILE LEPAS SULCATA SEEMS TO PREFER THE BACKS OF TURTLES AND THE SHELL OF THE LANTHINA THE SPECIES HOWEVER HAVE NOT BEEN SUFFICIENTLY DISCRIMINATED NOR OBSERVATIONS OF THIS KIND MADE WITH THE REQUISITE CARE TO ENABLE US TO PROSECUTE FURTHER THIS PART OF THEIR NATURAL HISTORY IT IS EVIDENT THAT THEY POSSESS LOCOMOTIVE POWERS WHICH ENABLE THEM AT EVERY INSTANT TO CHANGE THEIR SITUA TION AND A CONSPICUOUS EYE TO GUIDE THEM IN THEIR CHOICE THESE REMARKABLE AND IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES CONNECTED AS THEY ARE WITH THOSE RE LATING TO THE CRUSTACEA  COMPLETE THE NATURAL HISTORY OF THIS TRIBE AND LEAD US TO THE FOLLOWING IMPORTANT RESULTS VIZ I THAT THE CIRRIPEDES DO NOT CONSTITUTE A DISTINCT CLASS OF ANIMALS AS THEY HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED BY ALL LATE NATURALISTS DR LEACHU LATREILLE LAMARCK CUVIER C BEING CONNECTED WITH THE CRUSTACEA DECAPODA THROUGH THE BALANI AND WITH THE EN TOMOSTRACA BY MEANS OF THE LEPADES II THAT THEY HAVE NO RELATION OR AFFINITY WHATEVER WITH THE TESTACEA AS SUPPOSED BY LINNEUS AND ALL THE OLDER SYSTEMATISTS III THAT THE CRUSTACEA NOW THEREFORE FURNISH EXAMPLES OF A CLASS IN WHICH WE HAVE ANIMALS FREE AND FIXED WITH EYES AND EYELESS AND WITH THE SEXES SEPARATED IN SOME AND UNITED IN OTHERS ALL OF WHICH ARE CHARACTERS TO WHICH NATURALISTS HAVE ATTACLHED THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE AS REGARDS CLASSIFICATION IV THAT THE PROOF OF METAMORPHOSIS BEING FULLY AND SATISFACTORILY ESTABLISHED TENDS STILL TO MAINTAIN THE AFFINITY SO LONG RECOGNISED BETWEEN THE CRUSTACEA AND INSECTA NOTETHE SAME ECONOMY IN REGARD TO THE DISPOSAL OF THE OVA HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN OTION BUT HITHERTO NO INDIVIDUAL HAS BEEN FOUND WITH THE OVA ON THE POINT OF HATCHING  COMPARE WITH THE LARVA OF ARTEMIS BRINE SHRIMP

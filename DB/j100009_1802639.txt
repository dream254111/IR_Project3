Pp vii 578 4 The whole range of the labor movement in its development and present conditions is here described by direct explanations and definitions The social economic legal and historical factors of modern industrialism are also brought out The compiler has endeavored to provide a convenient concise and accurate reference book on the subject One might question some statements for example in regard to Malthusianism it is hardly true to say that it now occupies a prominent place in the economic dis card The redundant population and recurrent famines in India and China show the contrary A rejection of the wagefund theory does not involve a rej ection of the population principle To the checks on too rapid population educed by Malthus has been added that of standard of living and its influence on the birth rate GEORGE M JANES BURNS C D Government and industry New York Oxford Univ Press 1921 Pp 315 CATCHINGS W Our common enterprises a way out for labor and capital Newton Mass

of the development of international action in the field of labor legislation down to 1914 The material for this part of the work was submitted by the author in 1919 to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics and a large part of it was published by the Bureau in its bulletin 268 Historical survey of international action affecting labor The text of the labor clauses of the Treaty of Versailles and of the draft conventions and recommendations of the Labor Organ ization of the League of Nations through 1920 are added as a supplement and their content very briefly treated in the introduction There is one chapter in which the objections to labor legislation through international agreement are outlined and almost as briefly rebutted and another chapter in which the necessity of the adhesion of the United States to the inter national legislative movement is strongly urged The appendices supple ment and an extensive bibliography take up over half the book D A AlcC MOON P T The labor problem and the Social Catholic movement in France New York Macmillan 1921 Pp xii 399 325 The center of the authors interest is the Social Catholic movement not the labor problem From among the many countries in which this movement has manifested itself France is the one he has chosen for this study Inasmuch as the conditions which the Social Catholics are seeking to have reformed are for the most part labor conditions or arise out of conditions of labor the movement is concerned with standards of employment and with the spirit in which and the agencies through which the desired results are to be striven for The first half of the book is given over to a sketch of the historical background of the pro gram and methods of the presentday movement The influence upon it of Catholic leaders and Catholic groups in other countries is weighed and a decisive effect is attributed to the encyclical Rerum Novarum issued by Pope Leo XIII in 1891 The presentation of the views of individual leaders of the social teach ings of the Roman Catholic Church and of programs for dealing with the labor problem is supplemented by a description of the forms and activities of the various organizations now working for the adoption of the Social Catholic platform But a large part of the contemporary description is devoted to the political party which has adopted the Social Catholic program the Popular Liberal party Action Liberale Populaire The tendency to turn the spotlight on Catholic political parties and their positions on issues not strictly economic is also pronounced in the his torical narrative The author is obviously in sympathy with the movement he is describ ing and impressed with its importance This does not prevent him from giving its opponents their day in court Extracts from the speeches of leaders favorable and unfavorable to the movement are numerous There is much in the book of value to the student of principles and1922 Money Prices Credit and Banking 309 methods applied to the labor problem But the author is in error in hiis assumption that Cardinal Gibbons memorial to the Holy See in 1887 on the Knights of Labor was presented to secure a reversal of papal condemnation of the Knights in the United States That organization lhad been proscribed in Canada not in the United States What the Cardinal succeeded in securing was not the revocation of a condemnation but the prevention of a condemnation of the Kniglhts of Labor in the United States D A McC PARKER C S Working with the working woman New York Harper 1922 Pp 246 2 SLESSER

publication Morceaux Choisis DAlphonse Daudet edited and annotated by Frank W Freeborn Master in the Boston Latin School Episodes from Franfois le Champipar George Sand edited bv C Sankey MA Longmans Green  Co is the latest in the series of Episodes from Modern French Authors which this firm has undertaken The work of edi tor and printer we can recommend The story itself is one of the most de lightful of George Sands pastoral tales A very great deal of most valuable information has been put into the two hundred pages of Domestic Economy by F T Paul Longmans It grew out of a course of lectures the author had been in the habit of delivering at the Edge Hill Training College Liverpool The book is honestly made with a good purpose and may be read with profit no less than interest by all people who wish to live sensibly Livre de Lecture et de Conversation by C Fontaine D C Heath  Co is a book which believers in and users of the natural method in teaching modern languages ought at least to examine It is written entirely in French Its special features are great emphasis on the verbs and numerous questions on the subject matter which require answers and so lead to con versation There are excellent selections for reading The growing of bulbs to produce flowers in their greatest perfection is a branch of gardening peculiar to itself and one in which the minor yet im portant details are not generally understood In Bulbs and Tuberous Rooted Plants by C L Allen Orange Judd Co information is given by which the growing of bulbs can be made a pleasure or a profitable industry The author is a recognized authority on his subject The Mark in Europe and America by President Enoch A Bryan of Vincennes University Ginn  Co is a review of the discussion of Early Land Tenure prepared under the direction of the Department of Economics of Harvard University during a year of rest from the authors regular labors Using facts which are accessible to all the present discussion has been confined largely to the interpretation of these data The Pilgrim in Old England by Amory H Bradford DD Ford How ard  Hulbert is a review of the history present condition and outlook of the Congregational churches of England The substance of the book formed the course of Southworth Lectures for I892 at Andover Theological Seminary The work is chiefly a record of what has been done in Old Eng land by the brethren of the Pilgrims who settled New England The History of the Philosophy of Pedagogics by Charles Wesley Ben nett LLD C W Bardeen Syracuse is a brief sketch contained in the limits of 40 pages of the outlines of pedagogical development from the Re formers to Froebel It is a good abstract or syllabus of the period and will give a very fair notion of some important features in the development of education to those who have not time to read any one of the several good books on the period Joan of Arc The English Mail Coach by Thomas De Quincy edited by Professor J M Hart of Cornell University Henry Holt  Co in Readings for Students Series is so admirable a piece of work on the part of the editor that it might well be taken for a model The Introduction by 574Book Department the editor contains a life of De Quincy a critical estimate of his place in literature and an analysis of his style which will not be found surpassed elsewhere The notes are thoroughly good and scholarly For use in his classroom in connection with the study of an annotated edition of Livy Professor Rolfe of the University of Michigan has printed in a handsome pamphlet the WeissenbornMiiller text of the first book Aiming to cultivate in his pupils the power of rapid reading and recognizing as necessary to that end the habit of accurate pronunciation Professor Rolfe has everywhere indicated the quantity of the long vowels following as an authority Lewiss Elementary Latin Dictionary The pamphlet is published by Allyn  Bacon Boston Price 25 cents Education and Educators by David Kay FRGS Bardeen is a some what curious book A line or two of the authors text is regularly supple menlted by several hundred words of foot notes This style of composition does not make an agreeable book to read The book is really a vast collec tion of more or less miscellaneous notes on many things pertaining to edu cation The real value of the book lies in the fact that these notes are care fully indexed By turning to the index therefore the reader has at his disposal a goodly number of quotations from standard authors on almost any subject he may have under consideration It is a good book of educa tional quotations Collars Shorter Eysenbach Ginn  Co needs no introduction to the large number of teachers of German who are familiar with Collars Revision of Eysenbachs German Grammar The present edition has been prepared under Mr Collars direction by Mrs Clara S Curtis with the object of furnishing a book less copious in exercises and demanding less time for its completion and so meets the wants of the many students of German who can pursue that study for one or at most two years Exercises for reading have been otmitted in view of the numerous and excellent pieces of German literature suited for beginners that have appeared within the past few years The aim the method and every essential characteristic of the larger book have been kept Educational Labors of Henry Barnard by Will S Monroe C W Bar deen is a brief excellent biography of a man whom American teachers must always hold in highest honor In the words of Ray Palmer perhaps no man in the United States has done as much to advance direct and con solidate the movement for popular education He has done a work for which his country and cominig generations ought to thank hint and do honor to his name His work as editor of the American Journal of Edu cation which has been characterized as the best educational journal ever published anywhere in any land receives adequate attention Every teacher will be the better for knowing something of Henry Barnards life and this little volume is a very convenient and servicable means for acquir ing that knowledge The author of Geology by A J JukesBrown FGS Whittaker  Co has essayed a difficult task to write an  Elementary Handbook  of geology and it is brief praise to say that the work is more than usually well done There is no attempt at writing down to youth or beginners but the main facts of geology are very clearly told and with much completeness consid ering necessary brevity The sections on aqueous rocks are samples of such good work So also the treatment of stratification jointing and vertical oscillation of land masses subjects not often well discussed in elementary works There is much judicious citation of illustrations as for example from the Voyage of the Challenger and the Cruise of the Blake The chap ters on Historical Geology are too exclusively English to be very serviceable to beginners in America The meager account of the nature work and for mer extension of glaciers is the most serious defect of the book A P Brigham 575The School Review From Leach Shewell  Sanborn comes a new edition of Horaces Satires and Epistles edited by James H Kirkland of Vanderbilt University While the work is based on the wellknown edition of Kiessling the com mentary does not profess to be a translation of his and Professor Kirkland assumes the entire responsibility for the work in its present form The text of the Satires and Epistles is printed entire but there are no notes on the following Satires Book I ii iii vii and viii Book II ii iii iv vii Epistles Book I iii v vi viii xixv xviii In general the cotmmentary is much more full than that of most American editions and the text well printed There is an introduction of twenty pages xhich discusses briefly the character of the Satires and Epistles the language metre and manu scripts Altogether the volume is very attractive and editions of Horace are not so numerous as to make an addition to the list unwelcome An Introduction to the Study of the Dependent Defective and Delin queut Classes by Charles Richmond Henderson AM DD D C Heath  Co is a book of more than general value to teachers It is coming to be recognized in this country largely through the work of Stanley Hall that the student of education must be as well a student of sociology This book is the result of twenty years experience on the authors part in actual contact with the classes he is studying and of wide experience in the prac tical administration of charity in its many forms The book is prepared as a textbook and covers a wide field Very rightly does the author say that exhaustive bibliographies are good only for the specialist that the general reader must have selected lists he gives therefore references to the best authorities on the various topics treated We are not aware of any other book so good to give the teacher a general idea of the field covered by sociological studies a field of which he cannot afford to be ignorant Eutropius Books l and II edited by Watson Caldecott Longmnans is in appearance a very attractive little book and on examination discloses the fact that the editor has done his work even better than the publisher The vocabulary is accurate precise and sufficient The maps are simple as would be expected in a book of the size of this but they will be found help ful and even essential in a correct reading of this history No Latin teacher can give the notes any consideration without feeling that the editor possesses that rare quality of sympathy which enables a teacher to retrace his own course and know from experience at just what points the students will find difficulty More than that the needed assistance is given very judiciously in the form of helpful suggestions rather than in mere translations This book would be a very desirable companion to the reader in classes of begin ners or it could be used with interest and profit as ani exercise in sight trans lations for more advanced pupils It is much to be regretted that in the notes references are given only to an English grammar that is not used in this country F A Gallup To the edition of the First Six Books of the Aeneid edited by President Harper and Mr Frank D Miller of the University of Chicago American Book Co are now added the Bucolics In the text of the latter the quantity of all long vowels has been uniformly indicated In other respects the treat ment of the text is similar to that of the Aeneid No pains seem to have been spared to make the edition attractive but it is open to doubt whether the scheme of inductive study proposed is best suited to the needs of the young pupil as yet unacquainted with the text Some of the suggestions in the commentary too are of doubtful value as for example the long note on Aeneid I v 568 in which the editors find ground for a Roman belief that climate has to do with character In the bibliography several Eng lish editions of value besides Conington might have been named The essay on Vergil by Mr F W H Myers in the Fortnightly Review Febru ary I879 is several times referred to without mention of the fact that it is accessible in a volume of classical essays published by Macmillan  Co in I883 576Current Educational Literature It is but yesterday that we received The United States an Outline of Po litical J istory 14921871 by Goldwin Smith DCL Macmillan and yet a second edition has already been demanded Written professedly for Eng lish readers mainly the book is one that no American lover of his country or of his countrys history can be content not to know Mr Goldwin Smith has freed himnself singularly from the traditions of American IIstory makers and has dared to omit or characterize in a single brilliant phrase many episodes which have hitherto been foreordained to fill at least one long chapter He brought to the work almost a lifetime of sympathetic in terest in the institutions of the new world republic which has from time to time been manifested in notable ways Having been a warm admirer of the North during the Civil war he resigned the Regius professorship of Ilistory in Oxford in I868 to become Professor of English and Constitutional History in Cornell University Though he remailled in that chair but three years he stamped his personality deeply upon the growth of that institution He is the most American Englishman that has ever written on our country His prose style is strong original delightful The history of tlle United States has been written the past decade in many veins from many standpoints and for all sorts of readers Among all these histories Mr Goldwin Smiths work forms a class by itself It is individual in every phase CURRENT EDUCATIONAL LITERATURE Teaching Ethics in the HIigh School By PROFESSOR JOHN DiEwY Ed ucational Review November I893 We cannot too often protest against the assumption that if you can only teach a child moral rules and distinctions enough you have somehow fur thered his moral being From the side of ethical theory we must protest that all this is a caricature of the scientific method of ethics and of its sci entific aims Fronm tlie standpoint of practical morals we have to protest that the inculcation of moral rules is no more likely to make character than is that of astronomical formulae But this is a protest only against a faise view of morals and a false theory of ethics and not against the teach ing of ethics in schools when properly conceived Ethics rightly con ceived is the statement of human relationships in action In any right stuly of ethics then the pupil is not studying hard and fast rules of con duct lie is studying the ways in which mIen are bound together in the complex relations of their interactions To illustrate let the teacher at the outset ask the pupils how they would decide if a case of seeningl mis ery were presented to them whether to relieve it and if so how to relieve The object is not to get the pupils to arguing about the moral rules which should control the giving of charity but to get them into the habit of men tally constructing some actual scene of human interaction and of consult ing that for instruction as to what to do The end of tile method is the formation of a sympathetic imagination for human relations in action Through the special situation chosen the pupil should have brought home to him some of the typical features of every human interaction These typical features are the content of ethical theory One of these typical phases is the proper place of the emotions in conduct Another typical phase of all action which the pupil will be in a position to appreciate after carrying on for some weeks a study of this kind is that of the interrelation of all individuals These two factors of ethical action namely the place of impulse alnd intelligence and the multitude of relations to be considered 577

recommended to students and others by conscientious advisers Turning now to the consideration of continental microscopes so universally used in Europe and now happily gaining supremacy in this country we see at once that they conform to the practical re quirements which are disdained in the making of most American microscopes They are built with a firm base The stage is easily reached by the fingers when the hand is resting upon the table It carries no superfluous appurtenances but is large and flat The eyepiece is of such a height that when the instrument is vertical it is easy to look into it Concerning the lenses it must be said that most of the European manufacturers are very conscientious in regard to those which they furnish There are of course some makers who put upon the market objectives of inferior quality and which are sold as such and therefore at a correspondingly low price This is of course legitimate as there is a demand for cheap microscopes The price of these desirable microscopes is very much less than that of undesirable American ones According to our system of protection the physicians scientific men and students are taxed enormously if they buy a foreign instrument Put into plain Eng lish this means that we are heavily fined if we secure what we re quire in the way of microscopes while a small number of manu facturers whose moneymaking is of very little significance to the public receive a bonus for furnishing an inferior article at a high price Thus what is really important is sacrificed for what is unimportant Many valuable members of the nation are sacrificed by being obliged to pay for the advantage of a small number of men who have never shown themselves willing to supply to those by whose sacrifices they benefit the kind of instrument wanted Can any thing be more unjust  and are not we who are engaged in university careers in the practice of medicine or any other use ful occupation requiring the employment of microscopes justified in complaining of the condition of affairs which is little short of a national calamity  Is it unreasonable to ask the manufacturers of microscopes in this country to furnish us instruments of the kind we really need as some sort of acknowledgment of the money they extract from us whether we will or not  In expressing myself so decisively and emphatically upon the subject of American microscopes I have not considered it neces sary to give a detailed discussion of the relative merits and demerits of the different makes because what I have expressed is the opin ion in these matters of all the competent judges with whom I have talked on the subject I know positively that many of the best scientific men of America are ready to join me in saying as I said at the beginning that there is no American microscope which we should like to buy at any price for our own use CHARLES SEDGWIGK MINOT Boston Nov 24 The  Act of God  and  Fuerza Mayor MR MORGANS article in Science of Nov I8 The  Act of God and the RailwayCompany is highly interesting and suggests an illustration drawn from comparative national jurisprudence The English commonlaw doctrine of the  Act of God appears very scientifically elaborated in the laws of Mexico under the title of  fuerza mayor Our neighboring republic is greatly advanced in the science of law While certain disturbing elements there inter fere somewhat with the practical application of statutes at times according to our views at least nowhere on the continent has the science of law been more carefully studied and the results of that study more accurately defined and set forth in both constitutional and statutory form Religious faith too in Mexico is today as living and active a force in common personal life with the great body of the people as it was in Europe in the middle ages and this fact again as Mr Morgans article suggests illustrates how while the limitations of the OldWorld doctrine have been gradual ly narrowing in the United States it still holds its ground in Mexico with proportions which practically make it the leading condition of all contracts expressed and implied As an instance of how this provision enters into express contracts VOL X No 252 let us take the great railwayconcessions to the leading American companies In these concessions fuerza mayor generally appears in three distinct places The obligations of the company to build within certain fixed periods are suspended in case of fuerza mayor The concessions are forfeited by the companies carrying any foreign armed force or goods contraband of war unless they can show that this was done because they were unable to resist fuerza mayor Certain bounties granted to the railways cease during the time that the operation of the lines is suspended even if the suspension should take place by reason of fuerza mayor In the smaller transactions of daily life this doctrine continually appears as an unwritten law which suspends all other laws or contracts or obligations Superior force which often in Mexico means what would simply be called disaster in the United States is to the Mexican mind a good defence against almost any obliga tion For instance should one lease a boat for a month at a fixed sum and unusual storms prevent using the boat for half the month that would be ample reason why the lessee should tender only half the rent to the lessor and he feel constrained to accept the offer  Fuerza mayor is translated as  superior force or  uncontrolla ble circumstances These circumstances are nowhere to my knowledge defined but the facts of what are uncontrollable cir cumstances are to be decided in each case The coercion of an armed force is  fuerza mayor The violence of storms is  fuerza mayor The flooding of a river is fuerza mayor And as before remarked very generally what we are apt to consider as disaster in Mexico becomes  fueryza mayor and operates to relieve a con tract of its obligations To the American mind a contract made must be carried out and disaster if there is any falls on the man who has loosely guarded his contract In the confluence of the American and Mexican civilizations now taking place it becomes an interesting question how this wide difference between the usage and thinking of the two countries will adjust itself W W NEVIN New York Nov 21 The American Physique IN order to find out how closely the figures of makers of knit goods would correspond to those of the clothiers I sent a letter to one of the largest manufacturers I enclose his reply together with the figures You will observe that the figures on mens ware cor respond very closely with those of the clothiers making allowance for the tighter fit of the undergarments EDWARD ATKINSON EDWARD ATKINSON ESQ Dear Sir Your

newspapers a circumstantial account of the fall of a twoton meteorite in front of a bank in the town of Amsterdam NY I have seen nothing but this first announcement about it and fear the whole story may be a canard yet would like to know that it was a genuine happening Can you report the matter in Science and doubtless oblige many others besides  C H AMES Boston Nov 27

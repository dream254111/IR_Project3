RAIIWAYDAMAGESThe Calumet Electric Street Railway Co made a con tract with the complainants Fogg and Kinney whereby the lRailway Co agreed to pave a certain street in front of the lots of the complainants The consideration for the contract it is alleged was the damage which would result to the property from the building of the road The complainants signed a petition to allow the road to be built The road was built but the street has not been paved This is a bill to enforce a specific performance of the agreement Held That the agreement cannot be specifically enforced and that the court will not retain jurisdiction for the purpose of awarding damaiges Farson v Fogg 1903  Ill  68 N E Rep 755 The city of Chicago has control of the streets and the Street Ry Co cannot pave such streets without the consent of the city nor can a court of equity order specific performance in a suit to which the city is not a party The parties must be presumed to have known that the company could not perform without the consent of the city This is similar to a suit for specific performance of a contract to convey lands where the complainant knew at the time of filing thc bill that the defendant had no title In these cases it has always been held that a court of equity will not retain jurisdiction for the purpose of assessing damages The decision is supported by almost all of the cases where the question has been raised Hurlbut v Kantzler 112 111 482 Doan King e Co v Mauzey 33 Ill 227 Stickney v Goudy 132 Ill 213 23 N E 1034 Kennedy v Hazleton 128 U S 667 9 Sup Ct 202 32 L Ed 576 Mack v

stipulations against liability in the case of unrepeated mes sages except to the amount of the toll and against all liability in the case of cipher messages In this action against the Company plaintiff alleges neg ligence and claims danmages oneeighth cent per pound on the 500 bales amounting to 30489 Held that the telegraph company was liable for the tort and could not stipulate against its negligence for erroneously transmit ting unrepeated or cipher messages as under a constitutional provision of the state they were common carriers Postal Tel  Cable Co v Wells 1903 Miss  35 South Rep 190 Telegraph companies as a general rule have not been held as common carriers and are not subject to the same liability though they owe a duty to the public and must receive to the extent of their capacity all messages clearly written and transmit them for a reasonable compensation They may there fore limit their liability in a reasonable manner by means of reasonable rules and regulations Primrose v W U Tel Co 154 U S 1 Birkell v Tel Co 103 Mich 361 McAndrews v Elec Tel Co 17 C B 3 Camp v Tdl 420RECENT IMPORTANT DECISIONS Co 1 Met Ky 164 71 Am Dec 461 and note Such rules and regula tions have been held valid whether known to the sender or not Tel Co v Carew 15 Mich 525 Grinnell v Tel Co 113 Mass 299 The authorities are by no means uniform and while the liability may be limited as above according to the decisions of the Fnglish courts the Supreme Court of the United States and many of the state courts yet the decisions of many courts hold such regulations void as against public policy unjust unconscionable without consideration and wholly void Tyler v Tel Co 60 Ill 421 Telegraph companies are quasipublic servants They should no more be allowed to effectually stipulate for exemption from their duty than should a carrier of passengers or any other party engaged in a public business Why should they refuse to perform the common duty of care and diligence Hav ing taken the message and the pay why should they not do all things neces sary including the repeating for correct transmission See Ayer v Tel Co 79 Me 493 Tel Co v Griswold 37 Ohio St 301 Tel Co v Crall 38 Kan 679 The decision of the principal case marks the modern tendency toward a more strict rule of liability as shown in this case by the adoption of a constitutional provision making telegraph companies liable as common car riers TELEGRAMSFAILURE TO DELIVERLIMITATION OF LIABILITYThe plaintiffs were partners engaged in buying and selling horses in the states of Utah and Wyoming with their principal place of business in Ogden Utah They had about 280 head of horses at Green River Wyo which they had bar gained to sell to one Searcy at 1100 per head B B Brooks one of the partners sent two messages one marked rush to R S Brooks the other partner informing him when Searcy would arrive at Green River to receive and pay for the horses Neither message was delivered having been negli gently laid aside at the sending office and as a consequence the sale was lost The company relied in part upon the usual stipulations printed on the back of its blanks exempting itself from liability for mistakes or delays in the transmission or delivery or for the nondelivery of any unrepeated message whether happening by negligence of its servants or otherwise beyond the amount received for sending the same In this action for damages of the non delivery of the messages Held that such a stipulation could not limit the lia bility of the company for damages caused by the negligent laying aside of the messages at the transmitting office Brooks v W U Tel Co1903 Utah72 Pac Rep 499 While a telegraph company may restrict its liability to a reasonable extent it cannot escape liability for the consequences of its own negligence in failing to send or deliver the message See preceding note and Birney v Tel Co 18 Md 341 Tel Co v Collins 45 Kan 88 10 L R A 515 Mentzerv

BYRAM The problem of car service may be stated briefly as the formu lation of a plan whereby freight car equipment may be made to perform the maximum of service in a unified system of transporta tion with the minimum of sacrifice of the rights of the owner of the cars Under this definition the subject presents two distinct phases one economic the other financial In what manner shall car service be regulated in the public interest so that each unit shall furnish the greatest amount of trans portation How shall it be regulated so that rights of possession and com pensation for use will be equitably adjusted as between the owner and the user of the equipment The managers of the railroads and of other concerns which own the cars must consider the problem from the standpoint of the inter ests of their own concerns but they must also consider it from the standpoint of the public welfare The governmental regulating authorities are apt to consider the problem primarily from the standpoint of the public but they should not ignore the interests and the rights of the companies which have invested capital in cars Therefore while regulating authorities may put more emphasis on the interests and rights of the public and the railway managers may put more emphasis on the interests and rights of the individual companies there really is no fundamental difference between the problem of car service as it presents itself to the railway manager and to the regulating body and there can be no substantial differ ence between their solutions of it if each gives due weight to both the private and the public rights and interests involved It will be desirable to review the methods the railways themselves have used in dealing with the problem of car service before discussing the problem presented by regulation of car service Even under the system of car interchange in force before normal conditions were disturbed by the entrance of the country into the Great War the railway industry of the United States in its han 25THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY dling of car equipment bore some of the aspects of a single system The complexity of the problem of car service even under normal conditions had constantly grown greater It had been influenced by the number of conflicting interests involved which had increased in number through the advent of new and the dissolution of pre viously consolidated organizations by the great extent of territory through which car equipment was handled by the development of specialization in the adoption of equipment for the handling of particular commodities but more than all by the aggregate increase in the demands of industry for adequate equipment facilities the occasional scarcity of equipment and a recognition of the economic necessity under any condition of securing the best possible utiliza tion of existing equipment However important the problem may be under normal conditions its importance is greatly magnified when as now it is essential that every item of transportation equip ment be made to perform its full part in carrying out the purposes for which we are engaged in the war ELEMENTS OF THE PROBLEM The general term car service is commonly used to designate all that concerns the handling of the car as a vehicle of transporta tion not only as between one railway and another but also as between railways and the shipper or consignee On June 30 1916 according to the statistics of railways compiled by the Interstate Commerce Commission there were in service in this country ap proximately two and onehalf millions of freight cars Of these about 2300000 were owned by railway companies and the rest by private car line companies mining companies etc The number of the different classes of cars owned by the railways were as follows Box cars 1024418 Flat cars 136719 Coal cars 899638 Stock cars 83487 Tank cars 9828 Refrigerator cars 51746 Other cars 92427 Total 2298263 The mileage of all railways in the United States on the same date was 259210 miles There are then on the railways of the 26REGULATION OF CAR SERVICE United States approximately 9 freight cars per mile of railway The ownership of these cars excluding those of private ownership is in the hands of about 1000 railway companies The number owned by each company varies from a few cars to upwards of 250000 JOINT USE OF CAR EQUIPMENT The plan under which railways have for many years used equip ment interchangeably is the result of voluntary action on the part of railways themselves to the end of securing greater facility of operation and hence more efficient service The Interstate Com merce Commission has always recognized the commercial necessity of through shipments and consequently the movement of cars over other than the owning roads and indeed the original Act to Regu late Commerce seems to recognize it though in a negative way The Act approved on February 4 1887 provides that It is unlawful     to enter into any     agreement  to prevent  the carriage of freight from being continuous from place of shipment to place of destination     by carriage in different cars unless     such interruption was made for some necessary purpose  and without intent to interrupt continuous carriage etc In a decision rendered November 13 1911 the Commission affirmatively defined the duties of the carriers with reference to a unified service The railroads of the country are called upon to so unite themselves that they will constitute one national system they must establish through routes keep these routes open and in operation furnish all the necessary facilities for trans portation make reasonable and proper rules of practice as between themselves and the shippers and as between each other WHY THERE IS A PROBLEM If cars performed service only upon the road by which they are owned there would be no problem of car service regulation in the sense in which it now exists Between railways as distinguished from those phases of the problem that arise between railways on the one hand and shippers and consignees on the other the ques tions to be settled are predicated upon the ownership of the cars and their service upon other than the owning line For this reason the problem of car ser ice is of chief importance in times of scarcity 1 Missouri  Illinois Coal Co v Illinois Central 22 I C C 39 27THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY of equipment to meet the requirements of shippers car shortage  Since car shortage does not always mean a deficiency of equip ment upon all the railways considered as one transportation system but frequently means only that cars wanted in the West are de tained in the East or vice versa it is clear that some definite plan of distribution should be determined upon for securing the maximum of service from each car with the minimum of infringement upon the rights of ownership A fundamental principle has been laid down by the American Railway Association that every railroad is entitled to the use of cars equal to its ownership As a financial proposition it would seem that a road is entitled either to the service of its owned cars in which case it would be expected that their earnings would pay inter est on the investment and a fair average yearly earning plus an amount sufficient to keep them in repair and to provide for deprecia tion or if the cars are in the service of or detained on other roads to receive from the holding road compensation sufficient to cover these several items This is in its simple form the end to be attained It would seem perhaps that the application of a fixed mileage or per diem charge for the service or detention of a car upon a foreign road should afford an equitable basis for settlement between roads in all cases Both systems have been tried Neither has proved wholly satisfactory Up to 1902 except in a few experimental instances the only basis upon which a road received payment for the use of its cars on a foreign road was at a rate varying in different years from one and onehalf cents to threefourths of a cent per mile The main objection to the plan was that charges did not accrue when a car was not moving It might conveniently be used as a warehouse while cars belonging to the road holding it were engaged in more profitable service It is not necessary to mention the possibility of error in reporting mileage However it is much easier to check up the service of a car by days than by miles and in 1902 the railways constituting the American Railway Association adopted per diem rules by which the owning road is paid at a fixed daily rental while its cars are in possession of other roads which with numerous changes in rate and conditions of application have since remained the basis of settlement of car service between railways 28REGULATION OF CAR SERVICE Two VIEWS OF CAR SERVICE With the development of the American railway system there have developed two schools of opinion as to the rights of railways to the possession and use of rolling stock One rests on the basis that all car service rules that have ever been in force except as they may have been locally modified within recent months to meet emergency conditions recognize the fact that ownership of a car involves a right to its prompt return after it has performed its immediate function in the through service on which it had been forwarded The second school of opinion assumes that the creation of through routes and joint rates has in effect created a pool of all cars used in such service and that existing rules do not effectually regulate the service in the pool The Commission on Car Service of the American Railway Association in formulating the two views above set forth reported in March 1916 that whatever the solution of the problem the efficiency of the rules in force had not been proved because of the lack of their enforcement It then gave notice that beginning on June 1 1916 it would act not only as a mediator in disputed mat ters as heretofore but also would enforce the rules by the imposi tion of the penalties the rules authorized The Commission found it had not sufficient authority to deal with the existing situation The same emergency called for putting into effect certain changes in the rules and finally for the adoption of a revised code of rules which in turn has been upset in their operation by the transporta tion necessities of a nation actively engaged in war Car equipment is conveniently considered in two general classes Special equipment for example open cars ordinarily involves an empty return movement Under normal conditions its service seems to have been fairly regulated by the rules in force Legal tender equipment for example box cars may be and ordinarily is loaded at any time at any point in any direction when there is traffic The use of this class of equipment could not be effectively regulated under the rules formerly in force governing special equip ment because of a general recognition of the economic waste in volved in returning an empty box car directly to its home road when by a diversion it could advantageously be loaded for movement in another direction There has therefore been in effect for years a practically unregulated pool of this equipment The result has been 29THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY that in times of unusual movement of traffic roads that had provided a seemingly adequate supply were unable to furnish cars while roads with a less adequate supply were able to meet all demands because of their tenacity of hold upon foreign cars The unregu lated pool is therefore particularly unjust during times of car short age to originating lines that have provided their quota or more than their quota of cars It is likewise unjust to the public served by those lines which without fault of their own have been short of cars In times of surplus the unregulated pool is a source of injus tice to distributing lines because they are unable to get rid of the surplus equipment and are forced to pay per diem charges The situation and the remedy were summed up by the Com mission on Car Service in 1913 The following paragraphs are extracted from its report of that date To be just to the railroads themselves and to the public generally this pool should be regulated to the end that there shall be secured to every road the use when it needs them of its quota of legal tender equipment whether its own or the equivalent in foreign cars or in the alternative compensation in money for the difference Such regulation can be made effective only by the abandonment of the right to physical return to the owner of its own cars and the substitution of the right to possession and use by each line of legal tender cars in kind equiv alent to the cars by it owned and contributed to the pool The objections to recognizing a box car pool in the past have rested largely on the desire of roads thich have supplied their quota of legal tender equipment and have maintained it on high standards to be assured of the use of cars measur ing up to their standards The answer is that in practice existing car service rules have not secured this result so far as box cars are concerned It is true that the force of the objections to a box car pool is augmented by the inequalities in construction in strength equip ment capacity and cost of maintenance of the box cars contributed to this irregular pool by the different roads But it is also true that these inequalities are gradually disappearing The adoption of a standard box car should remove the last objection to such a pool and would besides be attended with a considerable saving in cost of building While there was as before stated no fair opportunity to test completely the effect of enforcement of the car service rules formerly in force the new system adopted since this country entered the war seems to have tended to demonstrate the efficiency of pooling in securing a maximum of service from each car and a minimum of de 30REGULATION OF CAR SERVICE lay to the shipper in meeting requisitions During the six months ending with September 1917 the railways handled 14 per cent more freight than in the corresponding months of last year with sub stantially no increase in equipment Though establishing a virtual pool of box cars the new rules recognize the right of the owner to the prompt return of special equipment and this is doubtless for the good of the service as well as a recognition of ownership rights The roads that have an adequate supply of special equipment coal refrigerator or automobile carsdoubtless have them because of the amount of traffic originating on their roads requiring such facilities It would neither be fair to them nor in the interests of the highest efficiency except in emergency to use this equipment for purposes for which the ordinary box car would serve as well or better Recently however a pool of the coal cars of the Eastern Railways has been temporarily established The principal features of the system developed by the Com mission on Car Service under the authority conferred upon it as a war measure and acting in cooperation with the Interstate Com merce Commission have been the transfer of equipment from one section of the country to another where there was a greater need for it and the success of its efforts to secure a greater efficiency of movement and loading of cars Local shortages have been reduced by the transfer to needy localities of the required equipment col lected in comparatively small lots from a large number of roads More than 200000 cars have been thus transferred Until the usual increase in volume of traffic in the late fall and the inevitable slowing down of movement in the early days of winter this system of handling by one authority had operated to reduce unfilled requisi tions for cars from 148000 cars on May 1 to 34000 on September 1 though as before stated 14 per cent more traffic had been handled than during the corresponding months of the previous year The increase in traffic handled was partly due also to the increased mileage per car per day in which the efforts of the railways were greatly assisted by the cooperation of shippers as they were also in the loading of cars more fully to capacity So far as box cars are concerned the present rules and the flexible system under which they are in force seem to afford the best means available for handling car service The designation from time to time of commodities that may or may not be transported in open cars or special equip 31THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY ment has a tendency to minimize the economic waste involved in the usual empty return movement Though designated as emer gency measures the rules and their application are based on effi ciency of service The power conferred upon one body to regulate car supply as exigencies may require seems to provide for fulfilling the con ditions of the economic phase of the question and the right of appeal concerning the handling and use of equipment by a foreign road affords means for equitable financial adjustment The slogan of the service is In all cases keep the cars moving and settle differences of opinion afterward As already intimated the Interstate Commerce Commission by act of Congress on May 29 1917 was given express authority to regulate car service The act defines the term car service as in cluding the movement distribution exchange interchange and return of cars used in the transportation of property It requires every carrier to establish observe and enforce just and reasonable rules regulations and practises with respect to car service and gives the Commission authority to suspend the operation of any rules regulations or practises then established with respect to car service for such time as may be determined by the Commission and also authority to make such direction with respect to car service as in its opinion will best promote car service in the interest of the public and the commerce of the people In the administration of this law the Commission in July 1917 organized a division of car service which under the reor ganization of the Commission has been changed to the Bureau of Car Service It is evident however that the Commission believes that the railways through their own Commission on Car Service have been doing all they could to secure the greatest efficiency in the use of cars for its Bureau of Car Service has thus far devoted itself chiefly to cooperating with the railways Commission on Car Service The Interstate Commerce Commission says in its annual report for 1917 Where occasion requires orders or directions will issue under the car service act and directly to the carrier or the carriers directly concerned Subject to this fundamental principle the Commission is availing itself and will continue to avail itself of cooperative effort on the part of the carriers Commission on Car Service     The present is peculiarly a time for the avoidance of unnecessary expense and duplication of work and it has seemed to the Commission desirable 32REGULATION OF CAR SERVICE to utilize to the fullest extent all means for insuring maximum efficiency in the handling of cars That the spirit and manner in which the Commission has gone about its regulation of car service thus far have been effective in furthering the object it mentionsviz insuring maximum effi ciency in the handling of carsis unquestionable In periods of heavy traffic such as the present when there are not enough cars to move all the freight the great problems of car service whether viewed from the standpoint of the managements of the railways or that of the regulating authority are first that of putting cars where they are most needed and second that of securing the utmost service from each car With equal information as to the conditions the decision of the railways Commission on Car Service and that of the Interstate Commerce Commissions Bureau of Car Service as to where cars are the most needed are pretty sure to be the same Likewise with the same information as to conditions their decisions are pretty sure to be the same as to the best methods of securing the greatest efficiency in the utilization of cars But it does not follow that government regulation of car service is superfluous The railway man naturally looks at the problem from the railway standpoint The representative of the government naturally looks at it from the standpoint of the public Friendly co6peration between the representatives of the government and the officers of the railroads is desirable in order adequately to protect and promote the interests of both railways and public 33

high schools of the larger American cities have never handled critically as many books as are found on highschool library shelves They have learned to read in primary schools read the required books in the grammar grades become familiar with school or classroom libraries and possibly used the childrens room of a public library there acquaint ance with books ceased for the obvious reason that firstgeneration Americans do not find a library at home But having acquired the ability to read they do not and cannot stop reading Their taste is being gradually formed or deformed by the reading of cheap newspapers and cheaper literature at home and on the streets The corner candystore sells nickel weeklies and lurid paperbound books containing tales of thrilling adventure and continuous excitement Penny dailies provide romance scandal and shallow philosophy until the ability to read becomes more of a danger than a blessing The result is apparent when boys who cannot be interested in Ivanhoe are found with A Boy on the Curb or The Secret of a Treasury Note among their schoolbooks Highschool teachers insist that the average entering student cannot name ten worthy books The teacher in the high school is then confronted with two problems He must teach the use of books and he must create a taste for good reading Unless our high schools do something like this for their graduates the four years will be wasted The English department of the Newark High School realizing these conditions began some years ago to compile a list of books for distribution to the pupils and to buy the books listed for the highschool library shelves Year by year as experience dictated the teachers added to and eliminated from this list until it reached its present form a thirtypage pamphlet Readingfor Pleasure and 187THE SCHOOL REVIEW Profit A List of Certain Books Which Young People Find Entertain ing Being Chiefly Books Which Older Readers Enjoyed When They Were Young published by the Free Public Library The list is the tangible expression of genuine cooperation between the high school and the library In I909 the library offered to annotate and print the list and to provide copies for distribution The library is careful to buy enough copies to provide for the demand and to keep them in a special case at the main library reserved for high school students The list was at first distributed to the several classes in sheets Experience has shown that the list as a whole is more highly prized by the students Receiving this list in the first year and noting books read through the course they possess at graduation an enjoyable record of their own reading for four years From fifty to one hundred books are suggested for each year By actually sending pupils to the shelves to select a book from those suggested overcoming inertia in some and a possible timidity in others the reading habit is often developed The student has an opportunity to handle and to examine carefully a great many books that are new to him and to discover his own taste in reading Each student in each term is to report to his instructor in English on one book of fiction one of nonfiction and one poem read during the term from the list provided The list from which he is to choose is broad For the first term when the desire for reading must to an extent be created the list is longer and broader than in the succeeding terms Strange would be the boy or the girl who in this alcove would find nothing to catch the eye and stay the hand SEA ADVENTURE Kidnapped ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON Captains Courageous

with the required English work of sec ondary schools it will be seen that the selection is by no means confined to collateral reading and that no attempt is made to keep the student to one period or one form of literature For example in the first halfyear highschool pupils study Hawthornes Tangle wood Tales and Bryants Translation of the Odyssey The list of eightyfive titles includes only three stories and ten descriptive works on the mythology folklore and customs of the Greeks and ten poems embodying Greek myths The mark of highschool teaching is uniformity the mark of genius is difference The slogan of highschool teaching is drill repetition The essential of literary enjoyment is surprise novelty movement The natural stimulus of good reading is in its creation of a desire to read the book through The scholars method is to hold you to the book so long that you are sick and tired of it So said Principal McAndrew in a recent address There is no doubt that the present intensive laboratory method of teaching English perhaps necessary with classes and curriculum over crowded does not make even Greek literature the source of joy it should be to the average young person If all reading is confined to one subject and no other and lighter reading suggested books grow distasteful by very insistence thereby defeating the probable purpose of the study of literature Reading from choice from such an inclusive list allows the pupil to follow his own bent and so creates a prejudice for instead of against the book Having read and enjoyed these books the pupil can and often does read something better Certainly the reading of six pieces of genuine literature every year for four yearsand we can expect little more from the growing boys and girls of this busy world ought consciously or unconsciously to give such a reader a basis for judgment and comparison Teachers who have used this list believe that it does one other and better thing it creates a positive distaste for poor and vulgar forms of writing I9go

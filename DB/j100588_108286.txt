J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,108286,ON THE HEAT DISENGAGED DURING METALLIC SUBSTITUTIONS,I207003,E 91 V ON THE HEAT DISENGAGED DURING METALLIC SUBSTITUTIONS BY THOMAS ANDREWS MD MJLIA VICEPRESIDENT OF QUEENS COLLEGE BELFAST 4C COMMUNICATED BY MICHAEL FARADAY ESQ F18 8RC C RECEIVED DECEMBER 16 1847READ JANUARY 20 1848 IN THE PRESENT COMMUNICATION I PROPOSE TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF SOME NEW INVESTIGA TIONS ON THE HEAT DISENGAGED IN CHEMICAL ACTIONS WHICH MAY BE CONSIDERED A CONTINUATION OF MY FORMER INQUIRIES ON THE SAME SUBJECT THE GREATER NUMBER OF THE EXPERIMENTS TO BE DETAILED IN THIS PAPER WERE MADE SOME YEARS AGO AND THE CON CLUSION AT WHICH I ARRIVED WAS BRIEFLY ANNOUNCED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE FOR AUGUST 1844 MORE RECENTLY I HAVE TAKEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO REPEAT MANY OF MY FORMER EXPERIMENTS AND TO ADD NEW ONES ON THE SAME SUBJECT ALL OF WHICH CONFIRM THE GENERAL RESULTS FORMERLY OBTAINED HAVING ORIGINALLY OBSERVED THAT ALTHOUGH A VERY LIMITED NUMBER OF BASES POTASH SODA BARYTES AND STRONTIA DEVELOPE NEARLY THE SAME QUANTITY OF HEAT WHEN A CHEMICAL EQUIVALENT OF EACH ENTERS INTO COMBINATION WITH AN ACID YET THAT THE GREATER NUMBER OF BASES DIFFER MOST WIDELY FROM ONE ANOTHER WHEN SO TREATED WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND THAT DIFFERENT ACIDS TAKEN IN THE STATE OF DILUTE SOLUTION PRODUCE WITH THE SAME BASE NEARLY THE SAME AMOUNT OF HEAT I VENTURED TO DRAW THE GENERAL INFERENCE THAT THE THERMAL EFFECTS PRODUCED ARE MORE INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH THRE BASIC OR ELECTROPOSITIVE THAN WITH THE ACID OR ELECTRONEGATIVE ELEMENT IN CON FORMITY WITH THIS VIEW IT APPEARED PROBABLE THAT IN THE DECOMPOSITION OF SOLUTIONS OF NEUTRAL SALTS BY THE ADDITION OF BASES OR METALLIC BODIES THE NATURE OF THE ACID OR ELECTRONEGATIVE ELEMENT OF THE COMPOUND WOULD EXERCISE NO SPECIAL INFLUENCE ON THE RESULT I HAVE ALREADY ENDEAVOURED TO ESTABLISH BY EXPERIMENT THE TRUTH OF THIS PRINCIPLE IN THE CASE OF BASIC SUBSTITUTIONS AND IN THE PRESENT MEMOIR I PROPOSE TO EXTEND THE SAME GENERAL LAW TO THE OTHER CASE IN WHICH ONE METALLIC ELEMENT RE PLACES OR IS SUBSTITUTED FOR ANOTHER FEW CHEMICAL ACTIONS ARE MORE SIMPLE IN THEIR FINAL RESULTS OR ADMIT MORE EASILY OF BEING VARIED WITHOUT CHANGING THE GENERAL TYPE OF THE REACTION THAN THOSE WHICH FORM THE SUBJECT OF THE PRESENT INQUIRY WHEN A NEUTRAL SOLUTION OF ANY SALT OF THE BLACK OXIDE OF COPPER AS FOR EXAMPLE THE SULPHATE THE CHLORIDE OR THE ACETATE IS PRECIPITATED BY METALLIC ZINC THE FINAL RESULT IS THE SUBSTITUTION OF AN ATOM OF ZINC FOR AN ATOM OF COPPER IN THE SOLUTION AND THE PRECIPITATION OF AN ATOM OF COPPER IF  TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL IRISH ACADEMY VOL XIX PP 228 293 ALSO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS FOR 1844 P 21 N 292 DR ANDREWS ON THE HEAT DISENGAGED THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF EQUIVALENT SOLUTIONS OF DIFFERENT SALTS OF COP PER BE COMPARED THEY WILL BE FOUND TO PRESENT ALMOST A COMPLETE IDENTITY AND THE SAME REMARK APPLIES TO THE SOLUTIONS OF THE SALTS OF ZINC WHICH REMAIN AFTER THE RE ACTIONS ARE FINISHED WE HAVE THEREFORE EVERY CONDITION FAVOURABLE TO THE PRODUC TION OF SIMPLE THERMAL RESULTS FOR THE PRESENT OBJECT IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO INQUIRE IN WHAT STATE THE METALLIC ELEMENT EXISTS IN AN AQUEOUS SOLUTION OF ITS SALTS OR WHAT CHANGES ACTUALLY OCCUR BETWEEN THE FIRST ADDITION OF THE ZINC AND THE FINAL PRECIPITA TION OF THE COPPER IT IS ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT THE FINAL RESULT IS THE SAME WHETHER WE EMPLOY A SOLUTION OF AN OXYSALT OR OF A HALOID SALT THE GENERAL RESULT OF THE WHOLE INVESTIGATION MAY BE STATED IN THE FOLLOWING TERMS WHEN AN EQUIVALENT OF ONE AND THE SAME METAL REPLACES ANOTHER IN A SOLUTION OF ANY OF ITS SALTS OF THE SAME ORDER THE HEAT DEVELOPED IS ALWAYS THE SAME BUT A CHANGE IN EITHER OF THE METALS PRODUCES A DIFFERENT DEVELOPMENT OF HEAT BY THE EXPRESSION  SOLUTION OF A SALT OF THE SAME ORDER IS UNDERSTOOD A SOLUTION IN WHICH THE SAME PRECIPITATE IS PRODUCED BY THE ADDITION OF AN ALKALI OR ON ONE VIEW OF THE COMPOSITION OF SUCH SALTS IN WHICH THE METAL EXISTS IN THE SAME STATE OF OXIDATION SALTS OF COPPER WITH ZINC TWO DISTINCT SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS WERE MADE WITH THE SALTS OF THE BLACK OXIDE OF COPPER AND METALLIC ZINC IN THE FIRST SERIES CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS WERE TAKEN AND INTRODUCED INTO A SMALL GLASS VESSEL IN WHICH WAS ALSO PLACED A GLASS TUBE OPEN ABOVE AND CONTAINING PURE ZINC IN A STATE OF FINE SUBDIVISION THE GLASS VESSEL CAREFULLY CLOSED WAS INTRODUCED INTO A LARGER VESSEL OF COPPER FURNISHED WITH A LID THE LATTER WAS FILLED WITH WATER ADJUSTED TO THE PROPER TEMPERATURE AND SUSPENDED IN AN OUTER VESSEL OF TIN PLATE AND THE WHOLE INTRODUCED INTO A CYLINDER CLOSED WITH A LID AND CAPABLE OF BEING ROTATED AFTER ALL PARTS OF THE APPARATUS HAD ACQUIRED THE SAME TEMPERATURE A VERY SENSIBLE THERMOMETER WAS INTRODUCED INTO THE WATER CONTAINED IN THE COPPER VESSEL THROUGH A SMALL ORIFICE IN THE LID AND THE POSITION OF THE MERCURY IN THE TUBE OBSERVED THE THERMOMETERS HAVING BEEN REMOVED AND THE ORIFICE CLOSED WITH A CORK THE LID OF THE OUTER VESSEL WAS SHUT DOWN AND THE ROTATING WHEEL MOVED THROUGH HALF A REVOLUTION BY WHICH MEANS THE METALLIC ZINC WAS BROUGHT INTO CONTACT WITH THE COPPER SOLUTION THE ROTATION WAS AFTERWARDS CONTINUED FOR FIVE MINUTES AND A HALF WHICH WAS FOUND TO BE SUFFICIENT NOT ONLY TO COMPLETE THE PRECIPITATION OF THE COPPER BUT ALSO TO DIFFUSE THE HEAT ARISING FROM THE REACTION UNIFORMLY THROUGH THE APPARATUS THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER WAS SO ADJUSTED AS TO RENDER THE CORRECTIONS REQUIRED FOR THE HEATING AND COOLING INFLUENCE OF THE AIR VERY INCONSIDERABLE THEIR AMOUNT WAS HOWEVER ASCERTAINED IN EACH EXPERIMENT AND THE RESULTS ALTERED ACCORDINGLY  FOR A DESCRIPTION AND REPRESENTATION OF A SIMILAR APPARATUS SEE TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL IRISH ACADEMY VOL XIXDURING METALLIC SUBSTITUTIONS 93 TO REMOVE ALL UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE STRENGTH OF THE SOLUTIONS A CONSIDERABLE QUAN TITY OF EACH SALT WAS DISSOLVED IN WATER AND A PORTION OF THE SOLUTION CAREFULLY ANALYSED BY PRECIPITATING THE OXIDE OF COPPER THE SOLUTIONS WERE ALL EMPLOYED IN A PERFECTLY NEUTRAL STATE IN THE SECOND SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS MORE DILUTE SOLUTIONS WERE TAKEN AND THE INCREMENT OF TEMPERATURE OBSERVED DIRECTLY IN THE SOLUTION IN WHICH THE PRECIPITATION OCCURRED THE ZINC COOLED TO THE SAME DEGREE AS THE LIQUID WAS INTRODUCED AFTER THE TEMPERATURE OF THE FORMER HAD BEEN OBSERVED AND THE WHOLE ROTATED FOR A PERIOD OF ONE MINUTE AND A HALF AFTER THE FINAL TEMPERATURE WAS TAKEN A FEW DROPS OF THE LIQUID WERE QUICKLY WITHDRAWN FOR FUTURE EXAMINATION AND THE APPARATUS WAS AGAIN ROTATED FOR A PERIOD OF ONE MINUTE AND A HALF ON AGAIN INTRODUCING THE THERMO METER THE TEMPERATURE OF THE LIQUID WAS ALWAYS FOUND TO BE A FEW HUNDREDTHS OF A DEGREE HIGHER THAN AT THE PRECEDING OBSERVATION ALTHOUGH THE WHOLE OF THE COPPER HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY PRECIPITATED AND ON REPEATING THE SAME OPERATION SEVERAL TIMES NEARLY THE SAME DEVELOPMENT OF HEAT OCCURRED ON EACH OCCASION THIS SECONDARY EVOLUTION OF HEAT AROSE FROM TWO DISTINCT CAUSES THE OXIDATION OF THE PRECIPITATED METAL BY THE AIR CONTAINED IN THE UPPER PART OF THE GLASS VESSEL AND THE VOLTAIC CIRCLE FORMED BY THE PRECIPITATED COPPER WITH THE ZINC IN EXCESS THE INFLUENCE OF THE FORMER CIRCUMSTANCE WAS CLEARLY PROVED BY REPEATING THE EXPERIMENT WITH THE VESSEL AS NEARLY FILLED AS POSSIBLE WITH THE SOLUTION WHICH CONSIDERABLY DIMINISHED THE AMOUNT OF THE SECONDARY DEVELOPMENT OF HEAT BUT WITHOUT ENTERING INTO A MINUTE DISCUSSION OF THE EFFICIENT CAUSES OF THIS RISE OF TEMPERATURE IT IS SUFFICIENT FOR THE PRESENT OBJECT TO OBSERVE THAT THE SAME CAUSES MUST HAVE BEEN IN OPERATION EVEN IN A MORE INTENSE DEGREE DURING THE GREATER PART OF THE FIRST PERIOD OF AGITATION AND WOULD RENDER THE INCREMENT THEN OBSERVED TOO HIGH THE APPLICATION OF THE REQUIRED CORRECTION IS VERY DIFFICULT AND THE UNCERTAINTY ON THIS POINT PREVENTS ABSOLUTE ACCU RACY BEING ATTAINED IN THE FOLLOWING NUMERICAL RESULTS AS THE MOST PROBABLE ESTIMATE I ASSUMED THE CORRECTION TO BE EQUAL TO THE INCREMENT OBSERVED DURING THE SECOND PERIOD OF ROTATION WITHOUT APPLYING ANY CORRECTION TO THIS INCREMENT FOR THE COOLING INFLUENCE OF THE AIR THE AMOUNT OF THIS CORRECTION WAS USUALLY ABOUT 0 1 C IT SHOULD BE CAREFULLY REMEMBERED THAT THE PRECIPITATION WAS IN EVERY EXPERIMENT PROVED TO BE COMPLETE AT THE END OF THE FIRST AGITATION BV REMOVING A FEW DROPS OF THE SOLUTION AND AFTERWARDS CAREFULLY TESTING IT IN THE FIRST SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS WITH THE SALTS OF COPPER NO CORRECTION WAS APPLIED FOR THIS SECONDARY DEVELOPMENT OF HEAT BECAUSE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ASCERTAIN ITS AMOUNT WHICH HOWEVER WAS PTO BABLY LESS THAN IN THE EXPERIMENTS OF THE SECOND SERIES FIRST SERIESSULPHATE OF COPPER AND ZINC

HEAT DISENGAGED DURING THE PRECIPITATION OF C F 1 GRM PLATINUM BY ZINC    8990 OR 16180 1 EQUIV PLATINUM BY ZINC    11085 OR 199530 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY INTERESTING TO HAVE EXTENDED THIS INVESTIGATION TO OTHER CASES OF METALLIC SUBSTITUTION SO AS TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PRESENT IN ONE COMPLETE VIEW THE QUANTITIES OF HEAT DEVELOPED IN ALL SUCH CASES BUT THE FACILITY WITH WHICH SOME METALS ARE OXIDIZED AND THE DIFFICULTY OF PRECIPITATING OTHERS IN A SHORT SPACE OF TIME FROM THEIR SOLUTIONS PREVENTED ME FROM FURTHER EXTENDING THE FOREGOING RE SULTS FOR CONVENIENCE I HAVE COLLECTED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE THE NUMERICAL QUAN TITIES ALREADY OBTAINED OF PRECIPITATED METAL 1 GRM 1 EQUIV 0 0 SALTS OF COPPER AND ZINC 868 3435 SALTS OF COPPER AND ITRON     592 2342 SALTS OF COPPER AND LEAD V    268 1061 SALTS OF SILVER AND ZINC 426 5747 SALTS OF SILVER AND COPPER  E   161 2176 SALTS OF LEAD AND ZINC 182 2357 SALTS OF MERCURY AND ZINC     333 4166 SALTS OF PLATINUM AND ZINC    899 11085 TO PREVENT MISTAKE IT MAY BE RIGHT HERE TO STATE THAT THE NUMBERS IN THE FIRST COLUMN EXPRESS THE DEGREES CENTIGRADE THROUGH WHICH ONE GRAMME OF WATER WOULDDURING METALLIC SUBSTITUTIONS 103 BE HEATED BY THE PRECIPITATION OF ONE GRAMME OF THE METAL FROM A SOLUTION OF ANY OF ITS SALTS AND THAT THOSE IN THE SECOND COLUMN EXPRESS THE DEGREES THROUGH WHICH THE SAME WEIGHT OF WATER WOULD BE RAISED BY THE PRECIPITATION OF AN EQUIVALENT OXYGEN 1 OF THE SAME METAL IF THREE METALS A B C BE SO RELATED THAT A IS CAPABLE OF DISPLACING B AND C FROM THEIR COMBINATIONS AND ALSO B CAPABLE OF DISPLACING C THEN THE HEAT DEVELOPED IN THE SUBSTITUTION OF A FOR C WILL BE EQUAL TO THAT DEVELOPED IN THE SUBSTITUTION OF A FOR B ADDED TO THAT DEVELOPED IN THE SUBSTITUTION OF B FOR C AND A SIMILAR RULE MAY BE APPLIED TO ANY NUMBER OF METALS SIMILARLY RELATED SEVERAL ILLUSTRATIONS OF THIS PRINCIPLE ARE AFFORDED BY THE PRECEDING TABLE THUS 1 EQUIV LEAD DISPLACED BY ZINC 23570 1 EQUIV COPPER BY LEAD   1061 1 EQUIV COPPER BY ZINC   3418 THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULT FOR THE LAST CASE IS 34350 WHICH IN SUCH INQUIRIES MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE IDENTICAL WITH THE THEORETICAL NUMBER AGAIN 1 EQUIV COPPER BY ZINC 34350 1 EQUIV SILVER BY COPPER 2176 1 EQUIV SILVER BY ZINC 5611 THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULT IS 57470 WHICH DIFFERS JRD PART FROM THEORY THIS DIF FERENCE ONLY CORRESPONDS TO AN ERROR OF ABOUT 004 AMONG THE THREE EXPERIMENTS AND THE AGREEMENT MAY THEREFORE BE CONSIDERED SATISFACTORY BY APPLYING THE SAME PRIN CIPLE WE CAN EASILY DEDUCE THE AMOUNT OF HEAT DEVELOPED IN OTHER CASES OF METALLIC SUBSTITUTION THUS AN EQUIVALENT OF MERCURY DISPLACED BY ZINC SHOULD GIVE 731 UNITS OF HEAT OF PLATINUM DISPLACED BY COPPER 7650 UNITS BY MERCURY 6919 UNITS C

have seen was a taking from the plaintiffs possession under a claim of dominion The trespasser like a disseisor acquired a tortious property Trespass therefore would not lie for a wrong ful distress for the distrainor did not claim nor acquire any prop erty in the distress This is shown by the fact that he could not maintain trespass or trover if the distress was taken from him on the way to the pound or taken out of the pound2 but must resort to a writ of rescous in the one case and a writ of deparcofracto in the other case In these writs the property in the distress was either laid in the distrainee or not laid in any one3 But the distrainee although debarred from bringing trespass was not without remedy for a wrongful distress From a very early period he could proceed against the distrainor by the action which after a time came to be known as Replevin This action was based upon a taking of the plaintiffs chattels and a detention of them against gage and pledge Hence Britton and Fleta treat of this action under the heading  De Prises de Avers and  De captione averiorum while in Bracton and the Mirrour of Justices the corresponding titles are De vetito namio and Vee de Naam  In the first part of this paper it was shown that the action of replevin was originally confined to cases of taking by I Continued from page 289 2  The distrainor neither gains a general nor a special property nor even the pos session in the cattle or things distrained he cannot mainitain trover or trespass It is not like a pledgee for he has a property for the time anid so of a bailment of

way of distress but that in the reign of Edward III it became a concurrent remedy with trespass But the change was for centu ries one of theory rather than of practice In the four hundred years preceding this century there are stray dicta but it is be lieved no reported decision that replevin would lie against any adverse taker but a distrainor2 We need not be surprised there fore at Blackstones statement that replevin  obtains only in one instance of an unlawful taking that of a wrongful distress 3 Lord Redesdale in Shannon v Shannon4 dissented from this statement saying that replevin would lie for any wrongful taking and his opinion has been generally regarded as law5 But the attempt to extend the scope of the action so as to cover a wrongful detention without any previous taking was unsuccessful6 From what has been said it is obvious that replevin has played a very small part in the history of trover and we may therefore pass without more to the last and for the purpose of the present essay the most im portant of our four actions the action of DETINUE The appeal trespass and replevin were actions ex delicto Det inue on the other hand in its original form was an action ex con tractu in the same sense that debt was a contractual action It was founded on a bailment that is upon a delivery of a chattel to be redelivered7 The bailment might be at will or for a fixed term or upon condition as in the case of a pledge The contractual nature of the action is shown in several ways In the first place the count must allege a bailment and a traverse of this allegation was an answer to the action8 1 Supra p 287 See also 3 HARVARD LAW REVIEW 31 2 See Mellor v Leather I E  B 6I9 Replevin against one who took as finder was allowed in Taylor v James Godb 150

concurrent with detinue 7 A buyer could also bring detinue against the seller for the chattel sold but not delivered But the position of the seller after the bargain was essentially that of a bailee

in which case the court pointed out a serious objection to the modern rule376 HARVARD LAW REVIEW Again detinue could not be maintained against a widow in pos session of a chattel bailed to her during her marriage because  ele ne se peut obliger  Nor for the same reason would the action lie against husband and wife on a bailment to them both2 Thirdly on a bailment to two or more persons all must be joined as defend ants for all were parties to the contract3 On the same principle all who joined in bailing a chattel must be joined as plaintiffs in detinue4 On the other hand on the bailment by one person of a thing belonging to several the sole bailor was the proper plaintiff5 For it was not necessary in detinue upoIn a bailment as it was in replevin and trespass to allege that the chattels detained were the igoods of the plaintiff 6 Fourthly the gist of the action of deti nue was a refusal to deliver up the chattel on the plaintiffs re quest that is a breach of contract Inability to redeliver was indeed urged in one case as an objection to the action although the inability was due to the active misconduct of the defendant  Brown If you bail to me a thing which is wastable as a tun of wine and I perchance drink it up with other good fellows you cannot have detinue inasmuch as the wine is no longer in rerzim natura but you may have account before auditors and the value shall be found This Newton C J denied saying detinue was the proper remedy7 It may be urged that the detinue in this case was founded upon a tort But in truth the gist of the action was the refusal to deliver on request This is brought out clearly by the case of Wilkinson v Verity8 The defendant a bailee sold the chattel intrusted to his care Eleven yedrs after this conversion the bailor demanded the redelivery of the chattel and upon the bailees refusal obtained judgment against him on the breach of the contract although the claim based upon the tort was barred by the Statute of Limitations The breach of contract is obvious where the bailee was charged in detinue for a pure nonfeasance as where the goods were lost9 Fifthly bailees were chargeable 1 Y B 20  2I Ed I I89 2 Y B 38 Ed III f i

HISTORY OF TROVER 377 in assumpsit after that action had become the common remedy for the breach of parol contracts1 Finally we find as the most striking illustration of the contract ual nature of the bailment the rule of the old Teutonic law that a bailor could not maintain detinue against any one but the bailee If the bailee bailed or sold the goods or lost possession of them against his will the subbailee the purchaser and even the thief were secure from attack by the bailor This doctrine maintained itself with great persistency in Germany and France2 In England the ancient tradition was recognized in the fourteenth century In I35I Thorpe a judge three years later said  I cannot recover against any one except him to whom the charter was bailed 3 Belknap afterwards Chief Justice said in I370  In the lifetime of the bailee detinue is not given against any one except the bailee for he is chargeable for life 4 Whether it was ever the law of England that the bailor was without remedy if the bailee died in possession of the chattel must be left an open question5 In a case of the year I323 it was generally agreed that the executor of a bailee was liable in detinue6 But the plaintiff in that case who alleged a bailment of a deed to A and that the deed came to the hands of the defendant after As death and that defendant re fused to deliver on request failed because he did not make the defendant privy to A as heir or executor Afterwards however the law changed and it was good form to count of a bailment to A and a general devenerunt ad manus of the defendant after As death7 Belknaps statement also ceased to be law and detinue 1 Wheatley v Lowe Palm 28 Cro Jac 668 s c See 2 HARVARD LAW REVIEW 56 2 Ileusler Die Gewere 487 Carlin Niemand kann auf einen Anderen mehr Recht

pos session of the chattel In other words the transformation in the manner just described of the bailors restricted right against the bailee alone to an unrestricted right against any possessor of the chattel bailed virtually converted his right ex contractu into a right in rem It is interesting to compare this transformation with the exten sion at a later period of the right of the cestuy que trust In the early days of uses the cestuy que use could not enforce the use against any one but the original feoffee to uses In I482 Hussey C J said  When I first came to court thirty years ago it was agreed in a case by all the court that if a man had enfeoffed another in trust if the latter died seised so that his heir was in by descent that then no subpena would lie2 Similarly the husband or wife of the feoffee to uses were not bound by the use3 Nor was there at first any remedy against the grantee of the feoffee to uses although he was a volunteer or took with notice of the use be cauise as Frowicke C J said  The confidence which the feoffor put in the person of his feoffee cannot descend to his heir nor pass to the feoffee of the feoffee but the latter is feoffee to his own use as the law was taken until the time of Henry IV VI  4 One is struck by the resemblance between this remark of the English judge and the German proverb about bailors  Where one has put his trust there must he seek it again 5 The limitation of the bailor at common law and the cestui que trutst in equity to an action or suit against the original bailee or trustee are but two illustrations of one characteristic of primitive law the inability to create an ob ligation without the actual agreement of the party to be charged6 not show how the deed came to defendant since he has shown a bailment to

necessity of the irivention of the writ qzare ejecit infra terminum as a remedy for a termor who had been ousted by his landlords vendee was due to this same primitive conception for the vendee was not chargeable by the landlords contractTHE HISTORY OF TROVER 379 A trust as every one knows has been enforceable for centuries against any holder of the title except a purchaser for value without notice But this exception shows that the cestuti que trust unlike the bailor has not acquired a right in remn This distinction is of course due to the fundamental difference between commonlaw and equity procedure The common law acts in rem The judgment in detinue is accordingly that the plaintiff recover the chattel or its value Conceivably the commonlaw judges might have refused to allow the bailor to recover in detinue against a bona fide pur chaser as they did refuse it against a purchaser in market overt But this would have involved a weighing of ethical considerations altogether foreign to the medieval mode of thought Practically there was no middle ground between restricting the bailor to an action against his bailee and giving him a right against any pos sessor Equity on the other hand acts only in personam never decreeing that a plaintiff recover a res but that the defendant sur render what in justice he cannot keep A decree against a mala fide purchaser or a volunteer is obviously just but a decree against an innocent purchaser who has acquired the legal title to the res would be as obviously unjust In all the cases of detinue thus far considered the action was brought by a bailor either against the bailee or some subsequent possessor We have now to consider the extension of detinue to cases where there was no bailment Legal proceedings for the re covery of chattels lost were taken in the earliest reported cases in the popular courts The common case was doubtless that of an animal taken as an estray by the lord of a franchise If the lord made due proclamation of the estray and no one claimed it for a year and a day the lord was entitled to it But within the year and day the loser might claim it and if he produced a sufficient secta or body of witnesses to swear to his ownership or loss of the animal it was customary for the lord to give it up upon the owners paying him for its keep and giving pledges to restore it in case of any claim for the same animal being made within the year and day1 There is an interesting case of the year 1234 in which after the estray had been delivered to the claimant upon his making proof and 1 Sel P1 Man Cts 2 Seld Socy 128I 31  Maud widow of Reginald of Char Ion has sufficienitly proved that a certain sheep an estray valued at 8d is hers and binids herself to restore it or its price in case it shall be demanded from her within year and day pledges John Ironmonger and John Roberd and she gives the lord 3d for his custody of it There is a similar case in the Court Baron 4 Seld Socy I324 144380 HARVARD LA W REVIEW giving pledges another claimant appeared It is to be inferred from the report that the second claimnant finally won as he pro duced the better secta1 If the lord or other person in whose hands the estray or other lost chattel was found refused to give it up to the claimant the latter might count against the possessor for his res adirata or chose adirree that is his chattel gone from his hand without his consent 2 or he might bring an appeal of lar ceny3 According to Bracton the pursuer of a thief was allowed  rem suarn petere ut adiratam per testimonium proborum hominum et si consequi rem suam quamvis furatam4 This statement of I3racton taken by itself would warrant the belief that the successful plaintiff in the action for a chose adirr4e had judgment for the re covery of the chattel This may have been the fact but it is diffi cult to believe that such a judgment was given in the popular court No intimation of such a judgment is to be found in any of the earlier cases It seems probable that Bracton meant simply that the plaintiff might formally demand his chattel in court as adiratum and by the defendants compliance with the demand recover it For in the sentence immediately following Bracton adds that if the defendant will not comply with his demand  si    in hoc ei non obtemperaverit the plaintiff may proceed further and charge him as a tlhief by an appeal of larceny This change from the one action to the other is illustrated by a case of the year I2336 The count for a chose adirree is described in an early Year Book6 The 31 Bract

precedent in Novae Narrationes f 65 which is sufficiently interesting to be reproduced here in its original form De Chyval Dedit Ceo vous monstre W c que lou il avoit un son chival de tiel colour

damages le dit W de XX s Et sil voet dedire c vous avez cy c que ent ad suit bon This count points rather to damages than to the recovery of the horse It is worthy of note also that its place in the Novae Narrationes  is not with the precedents in detinue but with those in trespass There seems to be no evidence of an action of chose adirree in the royal courts Nor has any instance been found in these courts of detinue by a loser against a finder prior to 13711 In that year a plaintiff brought detinue for an ass alleging that it had strayed from him to the seignory of the defendant and that he one month afterwards offered the defendant reasonable satisfaction for the keep Issue was joined upon the reasonableness of the tender2 Detinue by a loser against a finder would probably have come into use much earlier but for the fact pointed out in the first part of this paper that the loser might bring trespass against a finder who refused to restore the chattel on request Indeed in 145 53 where a bailiff alleged simply his possession and that the charters came to the defendant by finding Prisot C J while ad mitting that a bailor might have detinue against any possessor of goods lost by the bailee expressed the opinion that where there was no bailment the loser should not bring detinue but trespass if on demand the finder refused to give up the goods Littleton 1 In Y B 2 Ed II  f 2

Chart Det inue againist husband and wife Count that they found the charters 8 y B 33 Hen VI f 26 pL 12382 HAR VARD LA W REV IE W insisted that detinue would lie and his view afterwards prevailed It was in this case that Littleton in an aside said  This declara tion per inzventionem is a newfound Halliday for the ancient dec laration and entry has always been that the charters ad inanus et possessionemn devenernint generally without showing ihow Littleton was quite right on this point1 But the new fashion persisted and detinue sur trover came to be the common mode of declaring wher ever the plaintiff did not found the action upon a bailment to the defendant In the first edition of Liber Intrationum i5io f 22 there is a count alleging that the plaintiff was possessed of a box of charters that he casually lost it so that it came to the hands and possession of the defendant by finding and that he refused to give it up on request2 The close resemblance between this precedent and the earlier one from  Novae Narrationes  will have occurred to the learned reader But there is one difference In the count for a chose adirree it is the plaintiff who finds the chattel in the de fendants possession In detinue sur trover the finding alleged is by the defendant And until we have further evidence that the action in the popular courts was for the recovery of the chattel and not for damages only it seems reasonable to believe that detinue sur trover in the kings courts was not borrowed from the action of chose adirree but was developed independently out of detinue upon a general devenernnt ad mnanus But whatever question there may be on this point no one can doubt that detinue sur trover was the parent of the modern action of trover Add to the precedenit in the Liber Intrationum the single averment that the defendant converted the chattel to his own use and we have the count in trover It remains to consider how the action of trover at first became concurrent with detinue and then effectually supplanted it until its revival within the last fifty years There were certain instances in which detinue in its enlarged scope and trespass did not adequately protect owners of chattels Neither of these actions would serve for instance if a bailee or 1 Littletons remark seems to have been misapprehended in 2 Pollock  Maitland 174 The innovation was not in allowing detinue where there was no bailment but in describinig the defetndant as a finder The old practice was to allege simply that the goods came to the hands of the defendant as in Y B 3 Hen VI f 19 pl 31 See also Isaac v Clark I Bulst I28 130 In I655 it was objected to a count in trover and conversion that no finding was alleged but only a devenerunt admanus The objection was overruled Hudson v Hudson Latch 214 2 A similar count in Lib Int f 71THE HISTORY OF TROVER 383 other possessor misused the goods whereby their value was dimin ished but nevertheless delivered them to the owner on request The owners dnly remedy in such a case was a special action on the case We find such an action in the reports as early as i46i1 the propriety of the action being taken for granted by both coun sel and court If again after impairing the value of the goods the bailee or other possessor refused to deliver them to the owner on request detinue would of course lie But the judgment being that the plaintiff recover his goods or their value with damages for the detention2 if the defendant saw fit to restore the goods under the judgment the plaintiff would still have to resort to a separate action on the case in order to recover damages for the injury to the goods This was pointed out by Catesby in an early case3 and later by Serjeant Moore4 To prevent this multiplicity of actions the plaintiff was allowed to bring an action on the case in the first instance and recover his full damages in one action If a bailee destroyed the chattel bailed the bailor as we have seen could recover its value in detinue But if a possessor other than the owners bailee destroyed the chattel if for instance the tun of wine which Brown and his  bons conpagnons  drank up in the case already mentioned had come to the hands of Brown in some other way than through bailment by the owner it is at least doubtful if the owner could have recovered the value of the wine in detinue Brown in this case never agreed with the owner to give up the wine on request The plaintiff in detinue must therefore show a detention which would be impossible of goods already destroyed This was the view of Brian C J This con servative judge went so far indeed as to deny the owner an action on the case under such circumstances but on this latter point the other justices were  in contraria opinione 6 If case would lie

goods Such an action was brought against the bailee in a case of the year I4791 which is noteworthy as being the earliest reported case in which a defendant was charged with  converting to his own use the plaintiffs goods2 Choke J was in favor of the action Brian C J was against it Chokes opinion prevailed3 Later a wrongful sale was treated as a conversion In I5I0 the judges said an action on the case would lie against a bailee who sold the goods because  he had misdemeaned himself 4 In a word trover became concurrent with detinue in all cases of misfeasance Trover also became concurrent with trespass In i6oi the Court of Kings Bench decided that trover would lie for a taking5 In the same year the Court of Common Pleas was equally divided on the question but in I604 in the same case it was decided one judge dissenting that the plaintiff might have his election to bring trespass or case6 The Exchequer gave a similar decision in i6I07 In I627 in Kinaston v Moore8  semble per all the Justices and Barons    although he take it as a trespass yet the other may charge him in an action upon the case in a trover if he will In all these cases the original taking was adverse If however the original taking was not adverse as where one took possession as a finder a subsequent adverse holding as by refusing to give up the goods to the owner on request made the taker according to the

trespass in such a case That trover was allowed in Eason v Newman as a substitute for trespass and not as an alternative of detinue is evident when we find that for many years after this case trover was not allowed against a bailee who refused to deliver the chattel to the bailor on request The bailee was never liable in trespass but in detinue In I638 in Holsworths Case2 an attempt to charge a bailee in trover for a wrongful detention was unsuccessful as was a similar attempt nine years later in Walkers Case3  because the defendant came to them by the plaintiffs own livery A plaintiff failed in a similar case in I6504 In the  Compleat Attorney 5 published in i666 we read  This action trover properly lies where the de fendant hath found any of the plaintiffs goods and refuseth to deliver them upon demand or where the defendant comes by the goods by the delivery of any other than the plaintiff But in I675 in Sykes v Wales6 Windham J said  And so trover lieth on bare demand and denial against the bailee By these decisions trover became concurrent with detinue in all cases except against a bailee who could not deliver because he had carelessly lost the goods7 Indeed trover in practice by reason of its procedural advantages superseded detinue until the present century8 Although trover had now made the field of detinue and trespass its own there was yet one more conquest to be made Trespass as the learned reader will remember would not lie originally for a wrongful distress the taking in such a case not being in the nature of a disseisin In time however trespass became concurrent with replevin History repeats itself in this respect in the devel opment of trover In Dee v Bacon9 the defendant pleaded to an action of trover that he took the goods damage feasant The

regained some of its lost ground 9 Cro EL A 386 HARVA RD LAW REVIEW sion Salter v Butler and Agars v Lisle2 were similar decisions because as was said in the last case  a distress is no conversion The same doctrine was held a century later in two cases in Bun bury But in 1770 in Tinkler v Poole3 these two cases which simply followed the earlier precedents were characterized byLord Mansfield as  very loose notes and ever since that case it has been generally agreed that a wrongful distress is a conversion4 This last step being taken trover became theoretically concur rent with all of our four actions appeal of larceny trespass detinue and replevin and in practice the common remedy in all cases of asportation or detention of chattels or of their misuse or destruc tion by a defenidant in possession The career of trover in the field of torts is matched only by that of assumpsit the otlher specialized form of action on the case in the domain of contract The parallel between trover and assumpsit holds good not only in the success with which they took the place of other common law actions but also in their usurpation in certain cases of the function of bills in equity A defendant who has acquired the legal title to the plaintiffs property by fraud or duress is properly described as a constructive trustee for the plaintiff And yet if the res so acquired is money the plaintiff may have an action of assumpsit for money had and received to his use and if the res is a chattel other than money the plaintiff is allowed at least in this country to sue the defendant in trover5 In some cases indeed an express trustee is chargeable in trover as where an indorsee for collection refuses to give back the bill or note to the indorser Lord Hardwicke it is true had grave doubts as to the admissi bility of trover in such a case 6 but Lord Eldon reluctantly recog nized the innovation7 This innovation it should never be forgot teni was a usurpation Trover as a substitute for a bill in equity is and always must be an anomaly 7 B A mes 1 Noy 46 2 Hutt io 8 5 Burr 2657 4 I Ames  Smith Cases on Torts 274 n 3 6 Thurston v Blanchard 22 Pick i8 i Ames  Smith Cases on Torts 287 288 n 2 6

be recovered at law but there is no doubt that they might be recovered by a bill in equity

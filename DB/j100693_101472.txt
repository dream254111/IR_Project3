TO AVOYD CIRCUMLOCUTIONS CALL THAT IN STRUMENT WHEREIN A CYLINDER OF QUICKSILVER OF BETWEEN 28 AND 31 INCHES IN ALTITUDE IS KEPT SUSPENDED AFTER THE MANNER OF THE TORRICELLIAN EXPERIMENT A BAROMETER OR BAROSCOPE FIRST MADE PUBLICK BY THAT NOBLE SEARCHER OF NATURE MR BOYLE AND IMPLOYED BY HIM AND OTHERS TO DETECT ALL THE MINUT VA RIATIONS IN THE PRESSURE AND WEIGHT OF THE AIR FOR THE MORE CURIONS154 CURIOUS AND NICE DIFTINGUISHING OF WHICH SMALL CHANGES MR HOOK IN THE PREFACE TO HIS MICROGRAPHY HAS DESCRIBED SUCH AN INSTRUMENT WITH A WHEEL CONTRIVED BY HIMSELF AND BY THESE TWO LAST YEARS TRIALS OF IT CONSTANTLY FOUND MOST EXACT FOR THAT PURPOSE WHICH BEING SO ACCURATE AND NOT DIFFICULT TO BE MADE IT WERE DESIRABLE THAT THOSE WHO HAVE A GENIUS AND OP PORTUNITIES OF MAKING OBSERVATIONS OF THIS KIND WOULD FUR NISH THEMSELVES WITH SUCH OF THESE INSTRNMENTS AS WERE EXACTLY MADE AND ADJUSTED ACCORDING TO THE METHOD DELIVERED IN THE NEWLY MENTIONED PLACE TO SAY SOMETHING OF THE OBSERVATIONS MADE BY THIS IN STRUMENT AND WITHAL TO EXCITE STUDIOUS NATURALISTS TO A SEDU LOUS PROSECUTION OF THE SAME THE READER MAY FIRST TAKE NOTICE THAT THE LATELY NAMED MR BOYLE HATH AS HIMSELF NOT LONG SINCE DID INTIMATE TO THE AUTHOR OF THESE TRACTS ALREADY MADE DI VERS OBSERVATIONS OF THIS KIND IN THE YEAR 1659 AND 1660 BEFORE ANY OTHERS WERE PUBLICK OR BY HIM SO MUCH AS HEARD OF THOUGH HE HAS HITHERTO FORBORN TO DIVULGE THEM BECAUSE OF SOME OTHER PAPERS IN WHOSE COMPANY THEY WERE TO AP PEAR WHICH BEING HINDRED BY OTHER STUDIES AND EMPLOYMENTS HE HATH NOT AS YET FINISHED NEXT THAT BESIDES SEVERAL OTHERS WHO SINCE HAVE HAD THE CURIOSITY OF MAKING SUCH OBSERVATIONS THE WORTHY AND INQUI SITIVE DR JOHN BEAL IS DOING HIS PART WITH MUCH ASSIDUITY OF WHICH HE HATH BY SEVERAL LETTERS ACQUAINTED HIS FRIENDS IN LONDON BOTH BY OBSERVING HIMSELF AND BY PROCURING MANY CORRESPONDENTS IN SEVERAL PLACES IN ENGLAND FOR THE SAME PUR POSE JUDGING IT OF GREAT IMPORTANCE THAT OBSERVATIONS OF THIS KIND BE MADE IN PARTS SOMEWHAT DISTANT FROM ONE ANOTHER THAT SO FROM MANY OF THOSE ACCURATELY MADE AND THEN COM PARED IT MAY BE DISCOVERED WHETHER THE AIRE GRAVITATES MORE IN THE PARTS OF THE EARTH LYING MORE EAST OR WEST NORTH OR SOUTH WHETHER ON SUCH AS LIE NEERER TO THE SEA OR FURTHER UP INTO THE MAIN LAND IN HOTTER OR COLDER WEATHER WHETHER IN HIGH155 HIGH WINDS OR CALMS WHETHER IN WET WEATHER OR DRY WHE THER MOST WHEN A NORTH OR WHEN A SOUTH WHEN AN EAST OR A WEST WIND BLOWS AND WHETHER IT KEEPS THE SAME SEASONS OF CHANGES AND WHETHER THE SEASONS AND CHANGES OF THE AIR AND WEATHER CAN BE THEREBY DISCOVERD AND THE NOW HIDDEN CAUSES OF MANY OTHER PHAENOMENA DETECTED THE SAID DOCTOR IS SO MUCH PLEASED WITH THE DISCOVERY ALREA DY MADE BY THE HELP OF THIS INSTRUMENT THAT HE THINKS IT TO BE ONE OF THE MOST WONDERFUL THAT EVER WAS IN THE WORLD IF WE SPEAK OF STRANGENESS AND JUST WONDER AND OF PHILOSOPHICAL IM PORTANCE SEPARATE FROM THE INTEREST OF LUCRE FOR SAITH HE IN ONE OF HIS LETTERS WHO COULD EVER EXPECT THAT WE MEN SHOULD FIND AN ART TO WEIGH ALL THE AIR THAT HANGS OVER OUR HEADS IN ALL THE CHANGES OF IT AND AS IT WERE TO WEIGH AND TO DISTINGUISH BY WEIGHT THE WINDS AND THE CLOUDS OR WHO DID BELIEVE THAT BY PALPABLE EVIDENCE WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO PROVE THE SERE NEST AIR TO BE MOST HEAVY AND THE THICKEST AIR AND WHEN DARKEST CLOUDS HANG NEEREST TO US READY TO DISSOLVE OR DROPPING THEN TO BE LIGHTEST AND THOUGH SO HE GOES ON WE CANNOT YET REACH TO ALL THE USES AND APPLICATIONS OF IT YET WE SHOULD BE EN TERTAIND FOR A WHILE BY THE TRULY HONOURABLE MR BOYLE AS THE LEADING PERSON HEREIN UPON THE DELIGHT AND WONDER THE MAGNET WAS KNOWN MANY HUNDREDS OF YEARS BEFORE IT WAS AP PLIED TO FIND OUT NEW WORLDS TO ME SAITH HE TIS A WONDER FUL DELIGHT THAT I HAVE ALWAIES IN MY STUDY BEFORE MY EYE SUCH A CURIOUS BALLANCE HAVING THUS IN GENERAL EXPRESSED HIS THOUGHTS ABOUT THIS IN VENTION AND THE SINGULAR PLEASURE HE TAKES IN THE OBSERVA TIONS MADE THEREWITH HE DESCENDS TO PARTICULARS AND IN SEVE RAL LETTERS COMMUNICATES THEM TO HIS CORRESPONDENT AS FOL LOWS I MY WHEELBAROMETER I COULD NEVER FILL SO EXACTLY WITH MERCURY AS TO EXCLUDE ALL AIRS AND THEREFORE I TRUST MORE Y TO156 TO A MERCURIAL CANE AND TAKE ALL MY NOTES FROM IT THIS CANE IS BUT 35 INCHES LONG OF A VERY SLENDER CAVITY AND THICK GLASS THIS MAY EASILY BE CONVEYED TO ANY PLACE FOR TRIALS THE VESSEL FOR THE STAGNATING MER CURY INTO WHICH THE SAID CANE IS IM MERSED IS ABOUT TWO INCHES WIDE THE MERCURY SO WELL FILLD THAT FOR SOME DAIES IT WOULD NOT SUBSIDE BUT HUNG TO THE TOP OF THE GLASS CANE I KEEP IT IN A CLOSET PRETTY CLOSE 9 FOOT HIGH 8 FOOT BROAD 15 FOOT LONG NEER A WINDOW THIS I NOTE BECAUSE POSSIBLY THE CLOSENESS OF THE ROOM MAY HINDER THAT IT GIVES NOT THE FULL OF ALL CHANGES AS IT MIGHT IN A MORE PASSABLE AIR THE EXCLUSION OF ALL AIR IS HERE NECESSARY BECAUSE AIR BEING SUBJECT TO THE OPE RATION OF HEAT AND COLD IF ANY OF IT REMAIN IN THE BA ROMETER IT WILL CAUSE IT TO VARY FROM SHE WING THE TRUE PRESSURE OF THE AIR 2 IN ALL MY OBSERVATIONS FROM MAY 28 1664 TO THIS PRE SENT DECEMBER 9 1665 THE QUICKSILVER NEVER ASCENDED BUT VERY LITTLE ABOVE 3014 INCHES 3 IT ASCENDED VERY SELDOM SO HIGH VIDEL TO 3014 INCHES CHIEFLY IN DECEMB 13 1664 THE WEATHER BEING FICKLEFAIR E VENING 4 I FIND BY MY CALENDER OF JUNE 22 1664 AT 5 IN THE MOR NING IN A TIME OF LONG SETLED FAIR WEATHER THAT THE MERCURY HAD ASCENDED ABOUT HALF AN INCH HIGHER THEN 30 BUT I FEAR SOME MISTAKE BECAUSE I THEN TOOK NO IMPRESSION OF WONDER AT IT YET FOR 3  OR 4 DAIES AT THAT TIME IT CONTINUED HIGH IN WELL SETLED FAIR AND WARM WEATHER MOST PART ABOVE 30 INCHES SO THAT I MAY NOTE THE MERCURY TO RISE AS HIGH IN THE HOTTEST SUM MER AS IN THE COLDEST WINTERWEATHER 5 YET SURELY I HAVE NOTED IT ASCEND A LITTLE HIGHER FOR THE COLDNESS OF THE WEATHER AND VERY FREQUENTLY BOTH IN WIN TER157 TER AND SUMMER TO BE HIGHER IN THE COLD MORNINGS AND EVENINGS THEN IN THE WARMER MID DAY PERHIPS THIS IS FROM SOME INCLUDED AIR 6 GENERALLY IN SETLED AND FAIR WEATHER BOTH OF WINTER AND SUMMERTHE MERCURY IS HIGHER THAN A LITTLE BEFORE OR AFTEROR IN RAINY WEATHER 7 AGAIN GENERALLY IT DESCENDED LOWER AFTER RAIN THAN IT WAS BEFORE RAIN 8 GENERALLY ALSO IT FALLS IN GREAT WINDS AND SOMEWHAT IT SEEMD TO SINK WHEN I OPEND A WIDE DOOR TO IT TO LET IN STOR MY WINDS YET I HAVE FOUND IT TO CONTINUE VERY HIGH IN A LONG STORMY WIND OF 3 OR 4 DAIES IT SEEMS THESE WERE EASTERN WINDS 9 AGAIN GENERALLY IT IS HIGHER IN AN EAST AND NORTHWIND CAETERIS PARIBUS THAN IN A SOUTH AND WESTWIND 10 I TRYED SEVERAL TIMESBY STRONG FUMES AND THICK SMOAKS TO ALTER THE AIR IN MY CLOSET BUT I CANNOT AFFIRM THAT THE MERCURY YIELDED ANY MORE THEN MIGHT BE EXPECTED FROM SOME INCREASE OF HEAT SUCH AS HAVE EXACT WHEELBAROMETERS MAY TRY WHETHER ODORS OR FUMES DO  THE AIR 11 IN THIS CLOSET I HAVE NOT IN ALL THIS TIME FOUND THE EX TREAMEST CHANGES OF THE QUICKSILVER TO AMOUNT TO MORE THAN TO 234 OR TO 278 INCHES AT MOST 12 VERY OFTEN I HAVE FOUND GREAT CHANGES IN THE AIR WITHOUT ANY PERCEPTIBLE CHANGE IN THE BAROMETER AS IN THE DEWY NIGHTS WHEN THE MOISTURE DESCENDS IN A GREAT QUANTITY AND THE THICKNESS SOMETIMES SEEMS TO HIDE THE STARS FROM US IN THE DAYS FOREGOING AND FOLLOWING THE VAPORS HAVE BEEN Y 2 DRAWN158 DRAWN UP SO INVISIBLY THAT THE AIR AND SKY SEEMD VERY CLEAR ALL DAY LONG THIS I ACCOUNT A GREAT CHANGE BETWEEN ASCEND ING AND DESCENDING DEWS AND VAPORS WHICH IMPORT LEVITY AND WEIGHT AND BETWEEN THICK AIR AND CLEAR AIR WHICH CHANGES DO SOMETIMES CONTINUE IN THE ALTERNATIVE COURSE OF DAY AND NIGHT FOR A WEEK OR FORTNIGHT TOGETHER AND YET THE BAROSCOPE HOLDING THE SAME 13 SOMETIMES I FAY NOT OFTEN THE BAROSCOPE YIELDS NOT TO OTHER VERY GREAT CHANGES OF THE AIR AS LATELY DECEMBER 18 AN EXTRAORDINARY BRIGHT AND CLEAR DAY AND THE NEXT FOLLOWING QUITE DARKNED SOME RAIN AND SNOW FALLING BUT THE MERCURY THE SAME SO IN HIGH WINDS AND CALMS THE SAME 14 I DO CONCEIVE THAT SUCH AS CONVERSE MUCH SUB DIO AND WALK MUCH ABROAD MAY FIND MANY PARTICULARS MUCH MORE EXACTLY THEN I WHO HAVE NO LEISURE FOR IT CAN UNDERTAKE TO INSTANCE IN ONE OF MANY DECEMBER 16 LAST WAS A CLEAR COLD DAY VERY SHARP AND STRONG EAST WIND THE MERCURY VERY NEAR 30 INCHES HIGH ABOUT THREE IN THE AFTERNOON I SAW A LARGE BLACK CLOUD DRAWING NEAR US FROM THE EAST AND SOUTH EAST WITH THE EASTWIND THE MERCURY CHANGED NOT THAT DAY NOT THE DAY FOLLOWING THE STARS AND MOST OF THE SKY WERE VERY BRIGHT AND CLEAR TILL NINE OF THE CLOCK AND THEN SUD DENLY ALL THE SKY WAS DARKNED YET NO CHANGE OF WEATHER HAP PENED DECEMBER 17 THE FROST HELD ANDTWAS A CLEAR DAY TILL ABOUT TWO OF THE CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON AND THEN MANY THICK CLOUDS APPEARD LOW IN THE WEST YET NO CHANGE OF THE WEA THER HERE THE WIND FROST AND QUICKSILVER THE SAME DECEMBER 18 THE MERCURY FEIL ALMOST14 OF AN INCH AND THE SKY AND AIR SO CLEAR AND BRIGHT AND COLD WITH AN EASTWIND THAT I WONDRED WHAT COULD CAUSE THE MERCURY TO DESCEND I EX PECTED IT SHOULD HAVE ASCENDED AS USUALLY IT DOES IN SUCH CLEAR SKYS CASUALLY I SENT MY SERVANT ABROAD AND HE DIS COVERED THE REMOTE HILLS ABOUT 20 MILES OFF COVERD WITH SNOW159 SNOW THIS SEEMD TO MANITEST THAT THE AIR BEING DISCHARGED OF THE CLOUDS BY SNOW BECAME LIGHTER 15 I HAVE SELDOM SEEN THE CHANGE TO BE VERY GREAT AT ANY ONE TIME FOR THOUGH I DO NOT NOW TAKE A DELIBERATE VIEW OF MY NOTES YET I WONDERD ONCE TO SEE THAT IN ONE DAY IT SUBSIDED ABOUT34 OF AN INCH 16 OF LATE I HAVE ALTERED MY METHOD UPON THE BAROMETER OBSERVING IT AS IT IS BEFORE MY EYES ALL DAY LONG AND MUCH OF THE NIGHT BEING WATCHFUL FOR THE MOMENTS OF EVERY PAR TICULAR CHANGE TO EXAMINE WHAT CAUSE IN THE AIR AND HEAVENS MAY APPEAR FOR SUCH CHANGES AND NOW MY WONDER IS TO SEE HOW SLOW IT IS IT HOLDING MOST BETWEEN THE NINE AND TWENTIETH AND THIRTIETH INCH OF LATE 17 I MUST NOW IANUARY 13 16656 TELL YOU THAT THE MER CURY STANDS AT THIS TIME AS IT DID ALSO YESTERDAY A QUARTER A BOVE 30 INCHES YET BOTH DAYS VERY DARK AND CLOUDY SOME TIMES VERY THICK AND MISTY AIR WHICH SELDOM FALLS OUT FOR FOR THE MOST PART I SEE IT HIGHER IN CLEAREST SETLED WEATHER THAN IN SUCH CLOUDY AND MISTY FOGGS THIS THICK AIR AND DARKNESS HATH LASTED ABOVE A WEEK LATELY MORE COLD AND EAST AND NORTHEAST WIND THUS FAR THE NOTES OF THIS OBSERVING DIVINE OF WHICH MR BOYLETO WHOM THEY WERE ALSO COMMUNICATED ENTERTAINS THESE THOUGHTS THAT THEY SEEM TO HIM VERY FAITHFULLY MADE AND DO FOR THE MAIN AGREE WELL ENOUGH WITH HIS OBSERVATIONS AS FAR AS HE REMEMBERS NOT HAVING THEM IT SEEMS AT THAT TIME WHEN HE WROTE THIS AT HAND AND THOUGH IT BE WISHED BY HIM THAT THE OBSERVERS GLASSCANE HAD BEEN SOMEWHAT BIGGER YET HIS DILI GENCE IN FITTING IT SO CAREFULLY OR RA THER SO SKILFULLY AS IS ABOVEMENTIO NED IS MUCH BY HIM COMMENDED SOME THIS SEEMS TO BE WISHEDBE CAUSE THE MOTION OF THE MER CURY MAY BE MORE FREE IN A WIDER CANE

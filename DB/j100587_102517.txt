J100587,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16831775,102517,ACCOUNT OF A BOOK,I206885,240 IV ACCOUNT OF A BOOK LA MERIDIANA DEL TEMPIO DE S PETRONIO C I E THE MERIDIAN LINE OF THE CHURCH OF ST PETRONIO DRAWN AND FITTED FOR ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATI ONS IN THE YEAR 1655 REVISED AND RESTORED IN THE YEAR 1695 BY SIGNIOR JOHN DOMINICO CASSINI PRIMARY ASTRONOMER OF THE SCHOOL OF BONONIA PONTIFICIAL MATHEMATICIAN OF THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES AND RS PRINTED AT BONONIA 1695 IN TWENTY TWO SHEETS IN FOL IN THIS BOOK WRITTEN IN PART BY SIGNIOR CASSINI WHILST IN ITALY BUT AUGMENTED AND PUBLISHED BY SIGNIOR DO MINICO GUGLIELMINI AFTER HIS DEPARTURE THENCE THERE IS AN ACCOUNT GIVEN OF THE OCCASION OF THE MAKING OF THIS MERIDIAN LINE BY S CASSINI IN THE YEAR 1655 OF THE METHOD OF DOING IT AND OF THE EXACTNESS WITH WHICH IT WAS PERFORMED AT THAT TIME BY HIM THEN OF THE USES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE OF IT AND OF THE ALTERATIONS THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO HIS CHURCH SINCE THAT TIME AND OF THE RESTAURATION AND VERIFICATION OF IT IN THE YEAR 1695 BY THE SAID SIGNIOR CASSINI HIMSELF AND LASTLY OF THE USES THAT MAY BE MADE OF IT FOR THE FUTURE TO THIS DISCOURSE WHICH WAS WRITTEN BY SIGNIOR CASSI NI HIMSELF IS ADJOINED A DISCOURSE OF SIGNIOR DOMINICO GUGLIEMINI MATHEMATICIAN AND PUBLICK LECTURER OF BONONIA GIVING AN ACCOUNT OF THE OPERATIONS MADE AND OF THE INSTRUMENTS IMPLOYED IN THIS LAST RESTAURATION OF THE SAID MERIDIAN LINE IN241 IN THE FIRST SECTION S CASSINI SAYS THIS VERIFICATION WAS THE MORE CONSIDERABLE FIRST BECAUSE IT FELL OUT TO BE MADE THE YEAR BEFORE THE LAST INTERCALATION OF THE GREGORIAN ACCOUNT WHICH WAS FIRST ESTABLISHED IN THE YEAR 1582 SINCE WHICH TIME NO INTERCALATION HAS BEEN OMITTED BUT THE FIRST IS TO BE OMITTED IN THE YEAR 1700 TO REDUCE THE ANTICIPATION OF THE EQUINOCTIALS SINCE THAT TIME AND SO TO MAKE THE DAY OF THE VERNAL EQUINOX TO BE THE 21TH OF MARCH BY WHICH OPPORTUNE OCCUR RENCE THIS LINE WOULD AFFORD A PROPER MEANS TO OBSERVE EXACTLY THE TIME OF THE SUNS INGRESS INTO ARIES OR OF ITS PASSING THE EQUINOCTIAL CIRCLE SECONDLY BECAUSE IT WOULD BE A MEANS FOR DETERMINING A CONTROVERSY NOW MUCH AGITATED AMONG LEARNED MEN TO WIT WHETHER THE POSTIONS OF THE MERIDIANS AND PARALLELS OF PLACES ON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH DO REALLY ALTER OR NOT FOR THAT NOT ONLY THE PRESENT POSTURES OF THEM ARE FOUND VERY DIF FERING FROM THOSE ASSIGNED THEM BY THE ANCIENT GEOGRA PHERS BUT CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCES ARE ALSO FOUND OUT AMONGST THE MORE MODERN OBSERVATIONS AS IN THE PRE SENT MERIDIAN OF URANIBARG WHICH HAS LATELY BEEN FOUND BY MONSIEUR PICART ERASMUS BARTHOLINUS AND OTHERS TO VARY 18 MNUTES TOWARDS THE EAST FROM THAT FIXED BY THE NOBLE TYCHO BRAHE ABOUT 100 YEARS SINCE AND THE GREAT PYRAMID OF EGYPT HAS BEEN VERY LATELY FOUND TO STAND IN A POSTURE THAT TWO OF ITS SIDES DO RESPECT THE SOUTH NOW SIGNIOR CASSINI HAVING FOUND BY THIS LAST RECTIFICATION OF HIS MERIDIAN LINE THAT BOTH THE MERI DIAN AND PARALLEL OF BONONIA HAVE NOT BEEN ALTERED OR CHANGED NOW AFTER 40 YEARS SPACE CONCEIVES THAT THERE HAS NOT EVER BEEN ANY SUCH ALTERATION AS IS SUPPOSED BUT THAT THOSE DIFFERENCES THAT HAVE BEEN FOUND AT DISTANT TIMES HAVE BEEN OCCASIONED BY THE DEFECTS OR MISTAKES OF THE OBSERVATIONS THEMSELVES WHENCE HE CONCEIVES THAT THE ACCURATE ASTRONOMER TYCHO WAS MISTAKEN IN THE N N POSITI242 POSITION OF THE MERIDIAN OF URANIBURG AND AS TO THE PRESENT POSITION OF THE PYRAMID HE SUPPOSES IT WAS AT FIRST SO PLACED BUT BECAUSE NOTWITHSTANDING HIS OBSERVATIONS HE FOUND THAT MANY WERE OF A CONTRARY SENTIMENT AND THAT IT HAD PARTLY BEEN OCCASIONED BY A MERIDIAN FORMERLY FIXD IN THIS CHURCH HE IN THE NEXT SECTION GIVES AN ACCOUNT OF THAT OLD MERIDIAN LINE AND THE OCCASION OF THE FIRST MAKING OF THIS HE SAYS WAS FOR THE RECTIFYING THE TIME OF EASTER AND THE FEASTS OF THE CHURCH WHICH DEPEND UPON THE TRUE TIME OF THE VERNAL EQUI NOX FOR THE PRELATES OF ALEXANDRIA WHO WHEN DEPUTED BY THE COUNCIL OF NICE TO STATE THAT TIME FOUND IT THEN TO BE ON THE 21TH OF MARCH BUT POPE GREGORY BEING INFORMED THAT IN HIS TIME IT FELL ON THE 11TH OF THAT MONTH HE ALTERED THE JULIAN ACCOUNT AND MADE THE 11TH TO BE THE 21TH OF THE SAME MONTH THIS WAS THE OCCASION THAT LGNATIO DANTE PUBLICK LE CTURER OF MATHEMATICKS AT BONONIA FIRST MADE A MERIDIAN LINE IN THE PAVEMENT OF THE CHURCH OF ST PETRONIO IN THE YEAR 1575 SEVEN YEARS BEFORE THE ALTERATION MADE OF THE JULIAN ACCOUNT AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE GREGORIAN IN THE YEAR 1582 BUT THIS LINE OF DANTES HAVING BEEN FOUND TO VARY FROM THE TRUE MERIDIAN OF THE PLACE ANDSO TO BE SERVICEABLE ONLY FOR THE OBSERVING OF THE SOLSTICES IT VARYING 8 OR 9 DEGREES FROM THE NORTH TOWARDS THE EAST AND IT BEING SUPPOSED TO BE SO MISPLACED AT FIRST BY REASON OF THE OBSTRUCTION OF THE PIL LARS OF THAT CHURCH WAS THE OCCASION OF SIGNIOR CASSINIS FIND ING A FITTER PLACE IN THE SAME CHURCH AND OF FIXING THERE HIS NEW MERIDIAN LINE IN THE YEAR 1655 THE PLACE WHERE AND THE MANNER HOW HE HAS MORE PARTICULARLY AND FULLY EXPRESSED IN THIS DISCOURSE AND BECAUSE IT WAS OF SO CONSIDERABLE AND AS IT WERE OF SACRED USE TO THE CHURCH THE FEASTS THEREOF DE PENDING ON THE RECTIFICATION OF THE TIME MADE BY IT HE NAMES ALL THE EMINENT ASTRONOMERS WHO WERE HIS CONCOMITANTS AND ASSISTANTS IN THE OPERATIONS AS WITNESSES OF THE EXACTNESS OF THEM AFTER THIS HE RELATES SEVERAL VARIATIONS THAT HAVE HAP PENED TO THE FABRICKSINCE HE FIRST FIXED THIS HIS MERIDIAN LINE AND THEREBY SHEWS THE NECESSITY AND USE OF THE RESTAURATION AND ADJUSTING OF IT FOR THE TIME TO COME BY WHICH ANY FAR THER ALTERNATION THAT MAY HAPPEN TO THAT BUILDING OR OTHER WISE FOR THE FUTURE MAY BE SO FAR DISCOVERED AND REMEDIED AND THE ESSENTIAL PARTS OF THIS LINE SO FAR RESTORED AND RECTIFIED THAT THEY SHALL BE AS ESSECTUAL AS IF NO ALTERATION HAD HAPPEN ED243 ED THE USES OF WHICH WILL BE NOT ONLY TO SHOW THE TRUE TIME OF THE SUNS INGRESS INTO THE TROPICK AND EQUINOCTIAL POINTS BUT LIKEWISE INTO ALL THE OTHER EIGHT SIGNS AND SO WILL SERVE FOR THE VERIFYING AND RECTIFYING OF THE CALENDAR THE SAME BEING NOW SO PLACED AS THAT THE PERPENDICULAR HEIGHT OF THE HOLE BY WHICH THE LIGHT IS ADMITTED WHICH IS AN INCH IN DIAMETER IS 1000 INCHES OF THE PARISIAN FOOT ABOVE THE PAVEMENT AND THE MERIDIAN LINE WHICH IS AS A TANGENT TO ITHAS THE TANGENT OF 45 DEGREES ACTUALLY DIVIDED INTO 100000 PARTS UPON ONE OF THE MARBLE CHEEKS THAT BORDER THE RULER OR LATH OF IRON THAT EXPRESSES THE MERIDIAN LINE IN THE FLOOR OF THE CHURCHAND UPON THE OTHER CHEEK OF MARBLE ARE MARK ED THE DEGREES C OF THE DISTANCE OF THE SUN FROM THE ZE NITH WHEREON ARE ALSO MARKED THE PLACES OF THE SIGNS OF THE ECLIPTICK FROM THE OBSERVATIONS MADE BY THIS LINE SIG CASSINI CALCULATED HIS TABLES OF REFRACTIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN SINCE VERIFYED BY MANY OTHER OBSERVATIONS BOTH OF HIMSELF AND OTHERS THESE CONSIDERATIONS INDUCED THE SENTORS OF BONONIA WHO HAD THE CARE OF THE EDIFICE OF ST PETRONIO COMMITTED TO THEM TO BE AT THE CHARGE OF REPAIRING THE SAID MERIDIAN LINE AND TO TAKE CARE THAT IT SHOULD BE PRESERVED FOR THE FUTUREFOR WHICH INTENT THEY NOT ONLY CAUSED THE INSTRUMENTS MADE USE OF IN THE FIXING THIS LINE TO BE SAFELY PRESERVED BUT THEY ALSO DESIRED SIGNIOR GUGLIELMINI TO MAKE SO PERFECT A DESCRIPTION OF THEM THAT IN CASE OF THEIR DECAY IT MIGHT BE KNOWN HOW TO SUP PLY AND MAKE USE OF THEM FOR THIS PURPOSE FOR THE FUTURE WHICH INTENTION AND DESIRE THE SAID LEARNED PROFESSOR HAS FUL LY PROSECUTED AND COMPLEATED IN HIS DISCOURSE SUBJOINED TO THAT OF SIGNIOR CASSINI AND HE HATH ALSO ADDED SOME USEFUL TA BLES AS THAT OF THE PARTS OF THE RADIUS ANSWERING TO THE DI VISIONS OF THE TANGENT INTO DEGREES MINUTES C SECONDLY THOSE OF THE REFRACTIONS AND PARALLAXES OF THE SUN AT SEVE RAL ALTITUDES THIRDLY A TABLE OF DECLINATION OF EVERY POINT OF THE ECLIPTICK ANSWERING TO THE MINUTES OF DECLINATION FOR THE PRESENT OBLIQUITY OF THE ECLIPTICK WHICH HE MAKES TO BE 23 29 12 HE ADDS ALSO THAT HE HIMSELF BY ACCURATE OBSERVATIONS FINDS THE HEIGHT OF THE POLE AT THAT CHURCH TO BE 44 30 15 WHICH IS 1 15 GREATER THAN WHAT S CAS SINI HAD FOUND IT IN THE YEAR 1655 ALL WHICH PARTICULARS AND DIVERS OTHER VERY REMARKABLE MAY BE FOUND IN THE BOOK IT SELF TO WHICH THEREFORE I REFER THE READER V A

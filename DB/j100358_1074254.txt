IN THE ORDER OF THE CITIES MEN TIONED ABOVE AS SUPERINTENDENT NIGHTINGALE PERMITS US TO GIVE A CONSENSUS OF OPINION ONLY WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE SOURCE IN ANY CASE I I DO NOT KNOW 21 DO NOT KNOW NOTETWO HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPALS IN THIS CITY BOTH MEN ONE RECEIVES 2500 THE OTHER 2000 EXCLUDING THEM FOR CONSIDERATION NOW THE WOMEN RECEIVE ON THE AVERAGE 5644 A YEAR LESS THAN THE MEN WHICH IS NOT A GREAT DIFFERENCE THEY COST LESS WE CANNOT GET THEM FOR THE SAME BOTH THE SCHOOLS OF WHICH I HAVE CHARGE ARE GIRLS SCHOOLS ALSO THE SERVICES OF WOMEN CAN BE GOT FOR LESS MONEY I HAVE PERSONALLY NOTHING TO DO WITH FIXING THE SALARIES BUT AS MATTER OF OPINION I MAY SAY THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MENS PAY AND WOMENS PAY IS NOT DETERMINED WHOLLYPERHAPS NOT EVEN LARGELYBY A CORRESPONDING DIFFERENCE IN THE VALUE OF THEIR SERVICES CAN GET BETTER WOMEN FOR SAME PRICE WE BELIEVE THAT MEN AND WOMEN SHOULD BE ABOUT HALFANDHALF ARE OBLIGED TO TAKE A STRONG WOMAN NOW AND THEN BECAUSE WE CANNOT PAY ENOUGH TO GET A STRONG MAN NOTEWOMEN WITH US ENTER MORE HEARTILY INTO THEIR WORK RATHER THAN TO TAKE AN INEXPERIENCED FELLOW JUST OUT OF COLLEGE WE PREFER TO ENGAGE A WOMAN COLLEGE GRADUATE WHO HAS PROVEN HERSELF TO BE A DECIDED TEACHING SUCCESS PER SONALLY I PREFER MEN FOR HEADS OF DEPARTMENTS MY TWO STRONG TEACHERS ARE HOWEVER WOMEN WE PAY THEM 1200 AND 1500 RESPECTIVELY THEY ARE FULLY AS STRONG AS THE TWO MEN TEACHERS WHO RECEIVE SALARIES OF 2300 AND I900 RESPECTIVELY THESE MEN ARE MARRIED AND CANNOT AFFORD TO WORK FOR LESS WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND THE WOMEN ARE SINGLE NOT THAT I THINK SAME SAL ARIES SHOULD NOT BE PAID TO MEN AND WOMEN FOR SAME WORK BUT WOMEN ARE COMPETING UNDER DIFFERENT HOME CIRCUMSTANCES AND WILL ACCEPT LESS WE HAVE NO SCHEDULE OF SALARIES PAY WHAT IS 88RATIO OF MEN TO WOMEN IN HIGH SCHOOLS NECESSARY OUR SALARIES COMPARE FAVORABLY WITH SALARIES PAID IN ANY CITY IN THE UNION OF THE SAME SIZE SHOULD YOU PUBLISH ANY REPORT WONT YOU PLEASE SEND IT TO ME I AM VERY MUCH INTER ESTED IN THIS MATTER ENCLOSED YOU WILL FIND THE DESIRED INFORMATION AS FAR AS IT IS POSSIBLE TO GIVE IT OUR BOARD ASSUMES ALL THE RESPONSIBILITY IN THE SELECTION OF TEACHERS AND IT IS SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN THE MOTIVES WHICH DETERMINE A CHOICE CANNOT ANSWER CANNOT ANSWER I SEX NOT CONSIDERED 2 SEX NOT CONSIDERED P S IN FILLING A VACANCY SEX IS NOT CONSIDERED BUT OUR SMALL SALARIES SEEM MORE OF A TEMPTATION TO GOOD WOMEN THAN TO GOOD MEN HENCE THE MAJORITY OF OUR TEACHERS ARE WOMEN SINCE ABOUT TWOFIFTHS OF OUR PUPILS ARE BOYS I SHOULD FAVOR INCREASING THE SALARY OF MALE TEACHERS FOR THE PURELY BUSINESS REASON THAT SUCH ACTION WILL ATTRACT THE APPLICATION OF DESIRABLE MALE TEACHERS IN RESPONSE TO YOUR LETTER THE INFORMATION IS GIVEN BELOW SO FAR AS IT IS POSSIBLE TO GIVE IT I I THINK WOMEN ARE EMPLOYED HERE BECAUSE THEY ARE CONTENT TO WORK IN ALMOST ANY DEPART MENT FOR LESS MONEY THAN MEN 2 TWOTHIRDS OF ALL OUR PUPILS ARE GIRLS AND NEED AS MUCH INFLUENCE FROM WOMEN AS FROM MEN 3 THERE IS A SPIRIT PREVAILING IN OUR BOARD TO THE EFFECT THAT CERTAIN KINDS OF DISCIPLINARY WORK ARE BETTER WHEN DONE BY WOMEN 4 WOMAN FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL HAS TO A GREATER OR LESS EXTENT BEEN LOOKED UPON AS INFERIOR DEPENDENT WEAK WHILE IN THESE LATER YEARS SHE IS GRADUALLY BEING EMANCIPATED THE CHAINS OF SUPERSTITION ARE BEING BROKEN AND HENCE SHE IS BEGINNING TO BE LOOKED UPON FROM THE RIGHT POINT OF VIEW AND IS EVERY DAY IN LARGER AND LARGER NUMBERS FINDING HER WAY INTO NOT ONLY THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS BUT INTO ALMOST ALL THE AVENUES OF LIFE WHY DO WE PAY MEN MORE THAN WOMEN  THE MOST IMPOR TANT AND RESPONSIBLE POSITIONS ARE FILLED BY MEN IT IS OF QUITE 89THE SCHOOL RE VIEW RARE OCCURRENCE FOR A WOMAN TO BE CONSIDERED SUCCESSFUL EITHER AS A CITY SUPERINTENDENT OR A HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPAL 2 WAGES IS SOCIETYS RETURN TO ITS MEMBERS FOR SERVICES RENDERED IT IS A MATTER OF STATISTICS THAT WHERE A MAN IS EMPLOYED IN SCHOOL WORK HE SUPPORTS ON THE AVERAGE FOUR OTHERS WHILE IN THE CASE OF A WOMANS EMPLOYMENT IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS THERE IS RARELY MORE THAN ONE TO SUPPORT BESIDE HERSELF MEN GENERALLY CAN COM MAND IN OTHER PURSUITS OF LIFE ABOUT AS MUCH AS IS PAID THEM FOR SCHOOL WORK AND WOULD GO INTO THESE KINDS OF EMPLOYMENT IF THEIR PAY WERE NOT IN THEIR JUDGMENT COMMENSURATE WITH THEIR WORTH A GOODLY NUMBER OF OTHER SHADOWY MOTIVES ARE HOVER ING AROUND BUT I HAVE ALREADY MADE YOU WEARY OF READING THOSE ALREADY GIVEN BECAUSE WE WISH THE INFLUENCE OF GOOD WOMEN AND BECAUSE THEY CAN BE OBTAINED FOR LESS MONEY BECAUSE WE WISH THE INFLUENCE AND ABILITY OF GOOD MEN AND BECAUSE WE CANNOT GET THEM WITHOUT SO DOING PERMIT ME TO REPLY BRIEFLY TO YOUR NOTE OF NOVEMBER 6 WHICH WAS RECEIVED ONLY SATURDAY AS TO YOUR QUESTION WHY DO WE EMPLOY MORE WOMEN THAN MEN I DONT KNOW THAT I CAN SAY THAT THERE IS ANY POLICY CONTROLLING THE MATTER TO A CERTAIN EXTENT THE QUESTION OF SUPPLY DETERMINES THE MATTER IT IS EASIER TO FIND MORE GOOD WOMEN THAN GOOD MEN IN THE PROFES SION AND ESPECIALLY WITH THE SMALL SALARIES PAID TO MEN HERE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND MANY MEN WHO WILL ACCEPT POSITIONS AND KEEP THEM FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME THE GOOD ONES ARE VERY APT TO BE CALLED ELSEWHERE BY HIGHER SALARIES THE SCHOOL HAS LOST SOME OF ITS BEST MEN IN THIS WAY IN THE PAST AS TO YOUR QUESTION WHY DO WE PAY MEN MORE THAN WOMEN I CAN SIMPLY ANSWER IT BY SAYING THAT IN GENERAL WE DONT KNOW IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE ONLY LOGICAL WAY OF REGULATING THIS MAT TER WOULD BE BY THE LAW OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND TO PAY WHAT IS NECESSARY FOR EITHER GOOD MEN OR WOMEN TO GET THE BEST PER SON FOR THE PLACE GOOD AS THE WOMEN ARE IN OUR SCHOOL WORK 90RATIO OF MEN TO WOMEN IN HIGH SCHOOLS IT IS UNDOUBTEDLY A SOURCE OF WEAKNESS TO THE HIGH SCHOOLS THAT THERE IS NOT A LARGER NUMBER OF STRONG MEN ENGAGED IN THEM THIS CAN ONLY COME WHEN THE PECUNIARY REWARDS FOR LABOR IN THE SCHOOLS ARE SUFFICIENT TO ATTRACT A SUPERIOR ORDER OF MEN INTO THE PROFESSION THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT TRUE AT PRESENT THE APPOINTMENTS ARE MADE BY THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE AND THEIR REASONS ARE UNKNOWN TO ME WE CAN GET BETTER WOMEN TEACHERS AT SALARIES SUCH AS WE CAN OFFER WHY DO WE PAY MEN MORE THAN WOMEN WE DO NOT IF WE CAN GET SUITABLE TEACHERS FOR THE POSITIONS WHY DO WE EMPLOY MORE WOMEN THAN MEN BECAUSE THEY ARE NEEDED WHY DO WE PAY MEN MORE THAN WOMEN BECAUSE IT IS THE CUSTOM AND EFFICIENT WOMEN TEACHERS CAN BE SECURED AT SMALLER SALARIES HAVE NO SETTLED POLICY SOMETIMES THE NUMBERS ARE THE SAME I KNOW OF NO REASON EXCEPT CUSTOM AND THE FACT THAT WOMEN CAN BE FOUND WHO WILL DO THE WORK FOR THE PITTANCE PAID THEM I MUST REFER YOU TO THE BOARD 2 MUST REFER YOU TO THE BOARD TO SAVE MONEY BECAUSE THEY CANNOT LIVE ON LESS THAN I400 WHILE WOMEN CAN NOTE THE AVERAGE MALE ASSISTANT IS WORTH MORE TO A HIGH SCHOOL THAN THE AVERAGE FEMALE ASSISTANT OF COURSE THERE ARE NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS IN ALMOST EVERY SCHOOL BUT AS A RULE THE DIFFERENCE IN SALARY IS NO GREATER THAN THE DIF FERENCE IN EFFECTIVENESS RELIABILITY AND EVENNESS OF WORK WHY DO WE EMPLOY MORE WOMEN THAN MEN ON ACCOUNT OF EXPENSE WHY DO WE PAY MEN MORE THAN WOMEN CUSTOM CIRCULAR LETTER OF NOVEMBER 6 RECEIVED THE SALARIES ARE THE SAME FOR MEN AND WOMEN AND FOR REGULAR TEACHERS THE SAL 91THE SCHOOL REVIEW ARIES ARE IOO PER MONTH WITHOUT EXPERIENCE IN HIGH SCHOOL TEACHING I IO PER MONTH AFTER ONE YEARS EXPERIENCE I20 PER MONTH AFTER TWO YEARS EXPERIENCE I 30 AFTER THREE YEARS EXPER IENCE I40 AFTER FOUR YEARS EXPERIENCE WHICH IS ALSO THE MAXI MUM FOR ASSISTANTS I55 FOR HEADS OF DEPARTMENTS I65 FOR VICEPRINCIPAL 250 FOR PRINCIPALS THESE SALARIES ARE ON A BASIS OF TWELVE MONTHS A YEAR OUR STATE LAW PROVIDES THAT WOMEN TEACHERS SHALL RECEIVE THE SAME PAY AS MEN TEACHERS FOR THE SAME GRADE WORK THE REASON FOR THE SLIGHTLY LARGER NUMBER OF WOMEN TEACHERS IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT IN THE COMMERCIAL HIGH SCHOOL THERE ARE SEVERAL SPECIAL TEACHERS OF PENMANSHIP STENOGRAPHY ETC WHO RECEIVE SMALL SALARIES WE PREFER A MAJORITY OF MEN AS THERE IS LESS FRICTION BETWEEN TEACHER AND PUPIL AND LESS AMONG TEACHERS AND FURTHER BECAUSE IT IS THE ONLY SCHOOL IN THE CITY WHERE MEN CAN GET AN EVEN CHANCE IN THE GIRLS HIGH SCHOOL THE COMPARATIVE NUMBER IS JUST REVERSED THEY PREFERRING LADIES ON THE WHOLE WOMEN ARE CHEAPER OUR SALARIES ARE SMALL AS AN AVERAGE WHY DO WE PAY MEN MORE THAN WOMEN THE MARKET DEMANDS IT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SECURE FOR 800 A TRAINED AND EXPERIENCED WOMAN TEACHER FOR THE SAME SUM A GREEN COLLEGE GRADUATE MAY BE SECURED FOR TRAINING AT THE EXPENSE OF THE SCHOOL THE WOMAN WILL STAY AT HER WORK FOR YEARSTHE MAN AS SOON AS HE BECOMES OF VALUE TO THE SCHOOL MUST BE PROMOTED OR HE WILL LEAVE TO GO WHERE HIGHER SALARIES ARE PAID IT IS A SIMPLE QUESTION OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND GOVERNING THE PRICE OF WORK FOR THE TWO SEXES I CHEAPER FOR THE SAME TALENT 2 WE DO NOT TWO ECONOMIC QUESTIONS INVOLVING THE LAW OF DEMAND AND SUPPLY AND SKILLED LABOR I CHEAPER 2 HAVE TO FEW WOMEN APPLY FOR PRO FESSORSHIPS 92RATIO OF MEN TO WOMEN IN HIGH SCHOOLS THE REASONS FOR DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE TEACH ERS ARE MAINLY HISTORIC WITH US THE PROPORTIONS OF THE SEXES AMONG TEACHERS ARE NEARLY THE SAME AS WITH PUPILS ABOUT ONE THIRD MALE IN BOTH CASES IN SOME GRADES THERE IS NO DISTINCTION WHATEVER BETWEEN THE SALARIES OF MEN AND WOMEN SOME WOMEN WERE APPOINTED BEFORE COLLEGE GRADUATION WAS REQUIRED AS IS NOW THE CASE WITH NEW APPOINTEES TO GIVE ALL THE REASONS WOULD REQUIRE A LONG LETTER I CHEAPER 2 WORTH MORE I THEY SHOULD BE EQUAL IN NUMBER SUPPLY DEMANDS ETC MORE APPLICANTS AND WILLING TO WORK FOR LESS I THEY FILL LESS RESPONSIBLE POSITIONS 2 THEIR WORK IS WORTH MORE WERE THE WORK THE SAME WE BELIEVE THE PAY SHOULD BE THE SAME IN REPLY TO YOUR LETTER OF INQUIRY OF A RECENT DATE WILL SAY THAT  AS YET SUPPORTS BUT ONE HIGH SCHOOL A UNI FORM SALARY OF PER MONTH IS PAID TO ALL ASSISTANTS FOR AS MANY MONTHS AS THE SCHOOLS ARE IN SESSION DURING THE YEAR WHICH THIS YEAR WILL BE BUT NINE MONTHS I AM FIRST LAST AND ALWAYS OPPOSED TO THE METHOD AS PURSUED HERE IN THE ADJUSTMENT OF TEACHERS SALARIES IT PLACES NO VALUE ON EXPERIENCE AND TRAINING HALF THE TEACHERS AT LEAST IN ANY HIGH SCHOOL IN MY JUDGMENT OUGHT TO BE MEN BUT WITH  PRESENT LOW SALARIES IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET FIRSTCLASS MEN TO TAKE PLACES IN OUR HIGH SCHOOL DONT YOU THINK AS A CLASS MEN DO MORE RUGGED TEACHING THAN WOMEN  THEY SEEM TO GIVE VIGOR TO THE WORK THAT HARDLY SEEMS POSSIBLE WHEN THE WORK IS ALL DONE BY WOMEN WHAT PURPOSE HAVE YOU IN VIEW IN GATHERING THESE STATISTICS  DO YOU PUBLISH A SEPARATE REPORT OF YOUR HIGH SCHOOLS  IF YOU DO I WOULD LIKE MUCH TO HAVE A COPY OF IT I BECAUSE THEY ARE CHEAPER 2 WE PAY MARKET RATES 93THE SCHOOL REVIEW WITH EQUAL QUALIFICATIONS WOMEN CAN BE OBTAINED AT LESS SALARY THEY DO WORK THAT THE WOMEN CANNOT DO SO WELL I DO NOT 2 BECAUSE IN CERTAIN LINES OF WORK THEY ARE WORTH MORE WE EMPLOY MORE MEN THAN WOMEN BECAUSE WE NEED THE MAN INFLUENCE IN THE HIGH SCHOOL THE WORK OF THE WARD SCHOOLS IS DONE ENTIRELY BY WOMEN AND IT IS THE OPINION OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION AND THE SUPERINTENDENT THAT EVERY PUPIL NEEDS THE INFLUENCE OF SOME GOOD STRONG MAN DURING HIS EDUCATION I REMAIN WITH US LONGER 2 WE PAY THEM THE SAME WE MEAN TO MAKE THEM BOTH ALIKE I     2 SOME HAVE FAMILIES ARE STRONGER AS TEACHERS IN OUR HIGH SCHOOLS CONSEQUENTLY DESERVE MORE I COST LESS AND ANSWER THE PURPOSE IN LOWER GRADES 2 BECAUSE OF THE POSITION IN SCHOOL WHICH MEN OCCUPY WOMEN COULD NOT RENDER THE SERVICE REQUIRED OF MEN AND AS THE DEMAND FOR GOOD MEN IS GREATER THAN THE SUPPLY THEY CAN COMMAND A BETTER SALARY THAN WOMEN I BECAUSE WE CAN GET BETTER WORK FOR THE SAME MONEY 2 BECAUSE SUPPLY IS MUCH GREATER I BECAUSE THEY WILL WORK FOR LESS PAY AND BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE GOOD WOMAN IN THE PROFESSION THAN THERE ARE GOOD MEN AND A FIRST RATE WOMAN IS BETTER THAN A SECOND RATE MAN 2 BECAUSE IT IS THE CUSTOM PRINCIPALLY OUR BOARD THINKS THAT MORE USUALLY A MAN HAS A FAMILY DEPENDING UPON HIM THIS IS LESS OFTEN THE CASE WITH WOMEN MANY WOMEN TEACH WHO  DONT HAVE TO I CHEAPER FEWER TO BE HAD NO DISTINCTION AS TO SEX IF THE WORK REQUIRED IS DONE ALWAYS WISH TO KEEP A GOOD PROPOR 94RATIO OF MEN TO WOMEN IN HIGH SCHOOLS TION OF MALE TEACHERS AS THEY HOLD BOYS BETTER MALE TEACHERS BEGIN AS LOW AS  SALARIES ARE REGULARLY RAISED WITH APPROVED EXPERIENCE MEN CAN USUALLY TEACH A WIDER RANGE OF SUBJECTS OR SPECIALIZE MORE ON CERTAIN LINES WHICH WE WANT EXCEPT MY OWN SALARY AS PRINCIPAL THERE IS LITTLE DIFFERENCE REPLYING TO YOUR FAVOR OF THE 6TH INST WE HAVE IN THIS CITY BUT ONE HIGH SCHOOL WITH AN AVERAGE ATTENDANCE OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY PUPILS WE STRIVE TO SECURE THE SERVICES OF THE BEST TEACHERS PAYING THE WAGES NECESSARY TO SECURE SUCH SER VICE WE HAVE EMPLOYED MALE ASSISTANTS BUT PREFER A FIRSTCLASS FEMALE TO AN AVERAGE MALE TEACHER THE RATE OF COMPENSATION IS NOT BASED UPON SEX BUT FIXED BY CUSTOM WE HIRE AS LOW AS WE CAN AND ADVANCE THEIR SALARIES ANNUALLY IF THEIR WORK PROVES IN EVERY WAY SATISFACTORY WHY DO WE EMPLOY MORE WOMEN THAN MEN  MORE AVAILABLE WHY DO WE PAY MEN MORE THAN WOMEN THINK WE HAVE TO TO SECURE THEM IN THEIR SPECIAL WORK OF MANUAL TRAINING BUSINESS AND SCIENCE WHY DO WE EMPLOY MORE WOMEN THAN MEN  PARTLY CUSTOM WHY DO WE PAY MEN MORE THAN WOMEN  PARTLY BECAUSE A MAN IS MORE VALUABLE IN MANY RESPECTS WHY DO WE EMPLOY MORE WOMEN THAN MEN  INTENTION IS TO HAVE THE NUMBER EQUAL WHY DO WE PAY MEN MORE THAN WOMEN  I DONT KNOW YOU WILL HAVE TO CONSULT THE SCHOOLCOMMITTEE ON THAT QUESTION WHY DO WE EMPLOY MORE WOMEN THAN MEN  AT HOME  OUR OWN MORE AVAILABLE BETTER CHOICE FOR SO SMALL PAY WHY DO WE PAY MEN MORE THAN WOMEN  WE DO NOT EXCEPT FOR PRINCI PAL AND SCIENCE TEACHER FOR THEM PAY MUST ACCOMPANY REQUIRE MENTS P S LENGTH OFSERVICE IN LINE OF PRINCIPAL AND SCIENCE TEACHERS DUTIES IS NOT ACCOMPANIED WITH BOTH ABILITY AND ENDUR ANCE ON PART OF WOMEN THE BEST INFLUENCE ON BOYS AND GIRLS 95THE SCHOOL REVIEW REQUIRES BOTH MEN AND WOMEN AND MEN OF SAME AGE AND DISCRE TION AND HAVE A FAMILY ARE NOT LOOKING TO MARRIAGE AS A FEMALE AND SO COST MORE WHY DO WE EMPLOY MORE WOMEN THAN MEN  BECAUSE WE CAN GET A BETTER CLASS OF WOMEN FOR THE SAME SALARY WHY DO WE EMPLOY MORE WOMEN THAN MEN WE DO NOT WHY DO WE PAY MEN MORE THAN WOMEN ONLY THE THREE SCI ENCE MEN GET MORE WHY DO WE EMPLOY MORE WOMEN THAN MEN  BECAUSE THEIR MARKET PRICE IS LOWER WHY DO WE PAY MEN MORE THAN WOMEN  AS THIS QUESTION APPLIES PARTICULARLY TO MYSELF I MAY BE PREJU DICED IN MY REPLY BUT AS I FILL THE POSITION OF HEAD MASTER AND HAVE RECEIVED BETTER EDUCATIONAL ADVANTAGES THAN ANY OF MY ASSISTANTS AND HAVE ALSO HAD MORE EXPERIENCE I THINK THAT MY SALARY OUGHT TO BE VERY MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT OF ANY OTHER TEACHER WHETHER MAN OR WOMAN I RESPONSIBILITIES 2 PREVIOUS PREPARATION AND EXPERIENCE 3 SUPPLY AND DEMAND WOULD SEEM TO BE SOME OF THE FACTORS IN MAKING THE DIFFERENCE TO WHICH YOU REFER WHY DO WE EMPLOY MORE WOMEN THAN MEN  MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE FOR SIMILAR GRADE OF WORK PERSONALLY I WOULD PREFER SUCH WOMEN AS I CAN SECURE FOR IOOO PER ANNUM TO MEN WHO COULD NOT BE SECURED LESS THAN I500 TO 2000 I HAVE TWO SUCH WOMEN AT 700 AND ANOTHER AT 600 AND NEXT WEEK SHALL HAVE A THIRD SUCH AT 700 WHY DO WE EMPLOY MORE WOMEN THAN MEN WE DO NOT COUNTING ALL BECAUSE THEY CAN BE EMPLOYED FOR LESS MONEY I DO NOT FAVOR THE PAYING OF WOMEN LESS THAN MEN FOR THE SAME SERVICE BUT THE WHOLE QUESTION IS MORE ECONOMIC THAN SENTI MENTAL OR EVEN ETHICAL IT IS LARGELY A QUESTION OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND WHEN A WIDER RANGE OF OCCUPATION IS OPENED TO WOMEN THE CASE WILL BE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT 96RA TIO OF MA TO WOMEN IN HIGH SCIIOOLS I CANNOT ANSWER YOUR LAST QUERY ON ANY OTHER HYPOTHESIS THAN THAT OF BEING IN ACCORD WITH A CONTEMPTIBLE CUSTOM WHICH MADE THE ROMANS WIFE A LITTLE NEARER THAN HIS HORSE A LITTLE DEARER THAN HIS DOG OUR TEACHERS RECEIVING LEAST PAY DO THE MOST WORK HOW SHALL WE BREAK DOWN THIS OLD CUSTOM MORE HON ORED IN THE BREACH THAN THE OBSERVANCE AND INAUGURATE A MORE JUST SCALE OF WAGES  AN ASSISTANTS SALARY GETS A BETTER WOMAN THAN A MAN THAT IS NOT SO TRUE FOR THE DEPARTMENT SALARY WE SHOULD PAY OUR MEN MORE NOT DOING SO WHEN A MAN GETS GOOD FOR SOMETHING ON THE BASIS OF EXPERIENCE HE GOES FROM US AND WE HAVE TO BREAK IN ANOTHER WE CAN GET GOOD EXPERIENCED WOMEN AT FROM 800 TO I0OOO PER ANNUM AND ARE NOT SO LIKELY TO LOSE THEM BECAUSE OUR SALARIES FOR FEMALES ARE ABOUT AS GOOD AS THE AVERAGE A FIRSTCLASS MAN SHOULD GET AT LEAST IOOO I DONT KNOW WHY WOMEN SHOULDNT IN EQUITY GET AS MUCH IF THEY DO THE SAME WORK YET SUCH IS THE CONDITION OF THE MARKET I PREFER TO HAVE ABOUT AN EVEN DIVISION OF MEN AND WOMEN I THINK IT IS BETTER FOR THE BOYS AND GIRLS TO COME IN CONTACT WITH BOTH HOWEVER I WOULD NOT DESIRE TO HAVE A MAN OR A WOMAN JUST BECAUSE HE IS A MAN IF HE LACKED THE QUALIFICATIONS OF A GOOD TEACHER I DO NOT KNOW ANY REASON WHY A MAN SHOULD BE PAID MORE THAN A WOMAN FOR DOING THE SAME WORK AND FOR DOING THE WORK EQUALLY WELL DO YOU  A TEACHER SHOULD BE PAID ACCORD ING TO MERIT IT SEEMS TO ME AND THE SALARY SHOULD NOT BE DETER MINED BY SEX BUT THOSE IN AUTHORITY DO NOT ALWAYS THINK THAT WAY THE BEST DISCIPLINARIANS I HAVE ALMOST ALWAYS FOUND AMONG THE LADY TEACHERS I DO NOT MEAN THAT THEY HAVE BEEN THE MOST RIGID BUT THAT THEY HAVE SHOWN GREATER POWER TO INFLUENCE THE PUPILS FOR GOOD THE BEST TEACHERS OF ENGLISH WE HAVE EVER HAD HAVE BEEN WOMEN THE BEST TEACHERS OF MATHEMATICS HAVE BEEN MEN SCIENCE TEACHERS ALWAYS SEEM TO GET THE BEST SALARIES BUT THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS THE BEST TEACHERS BY ANY MEANS 97THE SCHOOL RE VIEK WE HAVE TWO HIGH SCHOOLS IN THIS CITY THE HIGH SCHOOL AND THE HIGH SCHOOL WHY DO WE EMPLOY MORE WOMEN THAN MEN  BECAUSE THE SALARY PAID IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO ATTRACT THE BEST MEN AS INSTRUCTORS WHILE IT DOES ATTRACT THE BEST WOMEN HENCE THE SCHOOLS OF THIS CITY ARE ALMOST ENTIRELY GIVEN OVER TO WOMEN FOR WANT OF GOOD MEN AS APPLICANTS WE PAY THE SAME SALARIES TO WOMEN AS TO MEN FOR THE SAME WORK THIS IS THE LAW OF OUR STATE AND I THINK IT IS A GOOD AND JUST ONE THE ONLY WAY THAT I CAN SEE TO GET MORE MEN IN THE PROFESSION IS TO PAY BETTER SALARIES BECAUSE THE BEST MEN WILL NOT DELIBERATELY CHOOSE A PRO FESSION WHERE THE SALARY IS A BARE LIVING WITH A PRETTY SURE PROS PECT OF PAUPERISM WHEN THEIR USEFULNESS IS ENDED I THINK THE EXCESS OF WOMEN IN OUR CORPS IS A RESULT OF CIRCUM STANCES RATHER THAN OF A DEFINITE PLAN ON THE PART OF THE BOARD AS A RULE BY THE TIME MEN HAVE HAD EXPERIENCE ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY A PROPER SALARY THEY CAN DO BETTER ELSEWHERE ALL OUR WOMEN TEACHERS HAVE HOMES IN    AND ARE LOATH TO LEAVE THEM FOR BET TER PAY AS TO THE LAST QUESTION WHY DO WE PAY MEN MORE THAN WOMEN YOU WILL SEE FROM ANSWERS ALREADY GIVEN THAT WE DO NOT PAY THE MEN MORE WHY DO WE EMPLOY MORE WOMEN THAN MEN WOMEN GOOD TEACHERS TOO WILL WORK FOR LESS PAY WHY DO WE PAY MEN MORE THAN WOMEN  WE DO NOT 98

ECONOMIC AND SCIENTIFIC QUES TIONS IN ORNITHOLOGY BY B W SHUFELDT M D WASHINGTON D C ORNITHOLOGY has attained to a status today never be fore reached by that science at any time within the recol lection of man or as shown by its literature In this country its cultivation not only interests thousands of amateurs but its pursuit is followed by a host of eager experts while its economic value has not altogether been overlooked by the government which annually makes an appropriation in support of a depart ment dealing with ornithological questions as related to agriculture Regarded as the science is then from so many varied standpoints it is not at all surprising that we find the collecting of birds actively undertaken for a great variety of purposes Some of these are perfectly justifiable and fall strictly within the demands of the science and are essential to its progress while others lie more or less without the pale of any such need and con sequently are deserving of our most energetic condemna tion or prosecution Thousands of birds are destroyed every year as a mere matter of sport and either no use made of them whatever or none worthy of mention In this category of course I do not include the killing of gamebirds for the table a privilege that can be properly restricted legally although it is very frequently more than abused Many native birds are annually trapped for cages and a large proportion of them perish Quan tities are destroyed by featherhunters to supply the demands of fashion Numbers are killed by ignorant farmhands who labor under the impression that they do humanity a direct benefit every time they take the life of a kingbird a martin or a marshhawk Then there are sa few taxidermists who habitually destroy birds as a business to preserve their skins and mount them for sale As a rule however taxidermists are engaged only in the preservation of such birds as are brought to them or else pursue their profession in scien tific educational institutions or elsewhere Next we meet with every grade of amateur and scien tific collector of birdskins who claim each year a certain proportion of specimens for scientific or semiscientific purposes In nature also some species prey upon others and thousands are thus annually destroyed while every season the lives of millions of others are claimed by Read at the Worlds Congress Auxilary of the Worlds Colum bian ExpositionDivision of Ornithology October 1827 I893 255 storms high winds and downpours of heavy rain Cer tain predatory mammals capture others or reptiles de vour their young No doubt finally that diseases in juries and accidents take away their annual quota but the proportion thus destroyed must in comparison with other causes of mortality be exceedingly small Now for a numiber of years past it has been widely no ticed that in the suburban districts of many cities all over the United States there has been a more or less marked decrease in numbers of many of our native birds as for example orioles robins bluebirds and many other species Frequently such reports are only too well founded in fact while in other cases they have been overrated Certain it is nevertheless that within the last twenty years birds in the most of such localities have been becoming more and more scarce while in some places where certain species were formerly abundant those very species are practically now almost extinct Numerous inquiries scientific and otherwise have been made with the view of finding out if possible the cause or causes which are accountable for bringing about this very unde sirable state of things After more or less mature delib eration some attributed it to one cause some to another and some to a combination of causes Many were dis posed to believe that the introduction of the English sparrow lay at the bottom of the whole trouble in the eyes of some the feathervenders had all to do with it while from other quarters the blame was attached entire ly to the taxidermists and the bird collectors As far as the writer has seen or heard not much importance has ever been attached to any other cause as a means of des truction of bird life with perhaps the exception of the introduction of large lighting apparatuses in many places where no doubt thousands of birds at night are yearly destroyed For more reasons than one the introduction of the English sparrow into this country was an expensive blun der but that they are chiefly responsible for the disap pearance of many of our native species of birds in the localities we have mentioned I never have in that view been a firm believer and my faith is not increased as time goes by In the first place it directly militates against every personal observation I have ever made in the prem ises and I have faithfully studied the species for many years Many of our native birds whip the English spar row in each and all contests where they come in contact and drive them out of the nesting places They almost invariably give way before robins catbirds wrens mar tins and many others Bluebirds appear to be more timid and gentle and they simply keep out of the spar rows way and make no attempt to oppose him while on three or four occasions last spring I have seen the com mon house wren deliberately hustle sparrows out of a birdbox where they had bred the season before and re occupy it themselves That the indiscriminate slaughter of small birds for milliner2 purposes by conscienceridden dealers was for a long time a prime cause has been proven beyond cavil and such people should simply be prosecuted by all the rigor of the law and made to desist quite as promptly as that party who would commit any act that threatened the agricultural interests of the country for no one will ques tion for a moment but what the removal of our insectiv orous birds does that very thing Were all the birds in the country destroyed there is no power known to man that could check the enormous increase in insect life or the destruction of plantlife that would follow as a con sequence Such a wholesale disturbance of Natures bal ance will not occur while on the other hand I am not prepared to say whether the recent known decrease in our birds in certain localities has been followed by a cor November Io I893Vol XXII No 562 responding increase of any particular species of noxious insects That is a point for the entomologist to decide for us What comparatively few birds are gathered in for sci entific purposes I am strongly of the opinion has but very little influence either one way or the other upon bird increase or decrease Take a city like Chicago for example and its extreme suburban environs how few indeed in proportion to her population are there of her inhabitants who collect in the neighborhood birds for scientific purposes In the course of a collecting season how many young scientific ornithologists in Chicago go out into her suburbs to collect birds Not in any suffi cient numbers I warrant to have any material effect upon the decrease of native birds The same suggestion is applicable to other large towns and cities in the United States and Territories When one comes to think of the millions of birds that pass over the country during the vernal or autumnal migrations every year and then come to compare that host with all that has been deducted from it during the last century as represented by all the birds actually existing in scientific collections the loss is hardly worthy of mention Moreover more than half of our scientific avian collectors do not collect in the sub urban districts but go far from the habitations of men and so their work cannot be said to affect the question at all But there is a cause in my opinion however for the scarcity of our native birds in and about cities and large towns of this country before which all other reasons we have mentioned stand absolutely aghast It is the whole sale destruction carried on by the army of unscrupulous small boys in any particular place I am the more con vinced of this from my observations in and about Wash ington D C during the past four years This active destruction has been made possible by the numerous comparatively recent and cheap inventions in the way of air and springguns as well as cheap rifles of small cali bre also other fatal contrivances that will noiselessly throw missiles of a variety of kinds with great accuracy Hundreds of those guns are sold annually to boys and the latter never seem to tire of strolling about orchards and hedgerows and knocking over dozens upon dozens of birds with them One day last spring I met one such youngster and upon examining his gamebag found it absolutely crammed full of dead birds which he had killed since starting out in the morning One item alone consisted of seventytwo ruby and goldencrowned king lets The same fellow boasted of having slain over one hundred catbirds that season Boys get to be wonder fully expert shots with the kind of guns to which I refer and as the ammunition costs little or nothing and a great quantity can be carried at a time it is easy to be seen that between the wholesale slaughter they can and do commit in addition to keeping the remaining birds per petually alarmed it is no wonder that they are soon driven away from the neighborhood of our cities and country seats There are ample legal measures within our power to enforce to prevent this cause of bird decrease especially if the fathers of those boys are held responsible and I would suggest that it be the sense of this congress that such measures will be recommended to the various State legislators hereafter that will have the tendency to thor oughly discourage such practices A NEW THERMOELECTRIC PHENOMENON BY W HUEY STEELE M A MELBOURNE UNIVERSITY IT Is stated in many textbooks and pretty generally known that electric currents may be produced by heating a single metal if there be any variation in temper or if the distribution of heat be very irregular and the changes of temperature abrupt These effects are generally sup posed to be exceedingly small compared with ordinary thermoelectric effects but some experiments performed by the writer in the Physical Laboratory of the Univer sity of Melbourne show that at high temperatures these effects are sometimes exceedingly large as great or greater than that given by a junction of antimony and bismuth at the same temperature At low temperatures this is most apparent in iron wires iron being the only metal in which I could observe the effect at a tempera ture below 100QC If a piece of iron wire be put in cir cuit with a very sensitive galvanometer and gently heated irregular currents will flow sometimes one way some times the other rising and falling in an apparently arbi trary manner I several times observed the effect simply by warming the wire with my fingers At a red heat the effect is much more marked and also much more irregu lar The effect in iron however is not so great as in some other metals at a high temperature the highest effect I observed in it being 002 volt Altogether twelve different metals and four alloys were examined and the effect noticed in each of them In order to raise thern to a high temperature without breaking circuit by their fusing I put them through clay tubes tobacco pipe stems and when examining metals with low melting points I completely filled up the tube with the metal A tube of lead when heated gave after a little irregular heating 3 volt and another with a lead wire passed through it and heated about the middle gave about half that amount but in this case there was no irregular or unsymmetrical heating The effects are not always steady in fact they very seldom keep steady but they may be observed with certainty by filling a tube with lead and raising it to a red heat in a Bunsen flame The effect may also be observed very easily in fine gold wire but it does not last so long as that in lead which shows no sign of ceasing after an hours or half a days heating With gold I observed a higher effect than with any other metal once observing nearly half a volt 3 volt was observed with six different metalslead copper gold tin zinc and antimony while with others e g silver and aluminum though I could certaiuly observe the effect it was exceed ingly small Sometimes when a netal is heated thus the changes in the electromotive force generated are slow and gradual and at times scarcely perceptible while at others they are rapid and sometimes apparently instantaneous at a time when the temperature is perfectly steady and nothing is apparent which could cause the changes An other curious effect is that sometimes when the temper ature is falling after the gas has been turned down or put out there are rises generally sudden in the e m f this was chiefly noticed in lead These phenomena are generally quite sufficient to mask the ordinary thermo electric effect at a red heat and thermoelectric tables are consequently quite unreliable for high temperatures CURRENT NOTES ON ANTHROPOLOGYNO XXXIV Edited by D G Brinton M D

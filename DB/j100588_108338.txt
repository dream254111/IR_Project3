C,I207002, 23  III MICROSCOPIC OBSERVATIONS ON THE SOCALLED VESICULAR VAPOURS OF WATER AS EXISTING IN THE VAPOURS OF STEAM AND IN CLOUDS SC BY A WALLER ESQ MD COMMUNICATED BY P M ROGET MD SEC RS RECEIVED APRIL 13READ JUNE 18 1846 IN A PAPER PUBLISHED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE FEBRUARY 1846 RESPECTING SOME MOLECULAR ACTIONS OF CRYSTALLINE PARTICLES I ENDEAVOURED TO EXPLAIN THE FIXATION OF PARTICLES OF MERCURY AND THE CONSEQUENT FORMATION OF IMAGES IN THE DAGUERREOTYPE PROCESS MY EXPERIMENTS LED ME AT THAT TIME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE VAPOURS OR RATHER FUMES OF CONDENSED STEAM CONSIST OF MINUTE GLOBULES OR SPHERULES OF WATER AND NOT OF SMALL VESICLES ACCORDING TO THE THEORY UNIVERSALLY RECEIVED AT PRESENT AND EXPRESSED BY THE TERM OF VESICULAR VAPOUR MY OPINION ON THIS POINT WAS FOUNDED ON THE RESULTS OBTAINED BY MICROSCOPIC IN SPECTION OF THE CONDENSED VAPOURS OF MERCURY AND OF OTHER BODIES AT THE SAME TIME I STATED THAT I WAS UNABLE IN THE CASE OF WATER TO CONFIRM IT BY DIRECT OBSERVATION SUBSEQUENTLY HOWEVER I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN DOING SO AND PROPOSE TO SHOW FROM THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS THAT THE OPINIONS ENTERTAINED RESPECTING VESICULAR PARTICLES OF WATER ARE COMPLETELY ERRONEOUS BUT BEFORE I DESCRIBE MY OWN EXPERIMENTS I THINK IT PROPER TO STATE SOMLLE OF THE IDEAS OF OUR PREDECESSORS IN SCIENCE ON VAPOURS OF WATER AND LIKEWISE THE GROUNDS ON WHICH THEY SUPPORTED THEM SIR ISAAC NEWTON ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS IN HIS OPTICS MENTIONS THE PARTICLES COMN POSING CLOUDS FOGS AND MISTS C SO AS TO LEAVE NO DOUBT THAT LIE CONSIDERED THEM TO BE COMPOSED OF MINUTE GLOBULES OR SPHERULES AS MAY BE SEEN IN THE FOLLOWING PASSAGES  BETWEEN THE PARTS OF OPAQUE AND COLOURED BODIES ARE MANY SPACES EITHER EMPTY OR REPLENISHED WITH MEDIUMS OF OTHER DENSITIES AS WATER BETWEEN THE TINGING CORPUSCLES WHEREWITH ANY LIQUOR IS IMPREGNATED AIR BETWEEN THE AQUEOUS GLOBULES THAT CONSTITUTE CLOUDS AND MISTSPROP III BOOK 2ND BUT WHEN IN ORDER TO COMPOSE DROPS OF RAIN THEY BEGIN TO COALESCE AND CONSTITUTE GLOBULES OF ALL INTER MEDIATE SIZES THESE GLOBULES WHEN THEY BECOMLE OF A CONVENIENT SIZE TO REFLECT SOME COLOURS AND TRANSMIT OTHERS MAY CONSTITUTE CLOUDS OF VARIOUS COLOURS ACCORDING TO THEIR SIZES AND I SEE NOT WHAT CAN BE RATIONALLY CONCEIVED IN SO TRANSPARENT A SUB STANCE AS WATER FOR THE PRODUCTION OF THESE COLOURS BESIDES TTLE VARIOUS SIZES OF ITS FLUID AND GLOBULAR PARTICLESPROP V IN NOTICING THE COLOURED AREOLA SURROUNDING THE SUN AND MOON IN CERTAIN CIRCUNSTANCES LE DOES NOT FAIL WHEN GIVING THE MEASURENENT OF THEIR DIATMETERS TO MENTION THE WAY IN WHICH THEY MAY BE APPLIED IN OBTAINING A KNOWLEDGE OF THE RELATIVE DIAMETERS OF THE GLOBULES OF WATER WHICH GIVE RISE TO THEMDR A WALLERS MICROSCOPIC OBSERVATIONS M KAEMTZ HAS OBTAINED SEVERAL INTERESTING RESULTS IN MAKING USE OF THIS MODE OF OBSERVATION WHICH HAS SO LONG BEEN NEGLECTED BY METEOROLOGISTS  BY MEANS OF THESE RINGS HE HAS ASCERTAINED THAT THE AVETAGE SIZES OF THESE PARTICLES VARY IN THE DIFFERENT MONTHS OF THE YEAR AND THAT IN SUMMER THEY ARE MUCH SMALLER THAN IN WINTER THE MEAN SIZE HE ASSIGNS TO THEM IS ABOUT 00224MM THE OPINION NOW ENTERTAINED RESPECTING THESE PARTICLES OF WATER CONSISTS IN REGARDING THEM AS COMPOSED OF SMALL BLADDERS OR VESICLES SIMILAR IN ALL RESPECTS BUT THEIR SIZE TO THE COMMON SOAPBUBBLE THIS THEORY IS GENERALLY ASCRIBED TO HALLEY NEITHER NEWTON NOR HALLEY APPEARS TO HAVE TAKEN ANY STEPS TO SUBMIT THEIR HYPOTHESES TO DIRECT OBSERVATION THIS WAS FIRST ATTEMPTED BY KRATZENSTEIN WHOSE EXPERIMENTS ON THIS SUBJECT DATING FROM 1743 EVINCE GREAT INGENUITY THE ORIGINAL WORK IS VERY SCARCE IN FRANCE AND NOT TO BE OBTAINED IN THIS COUNTRY BUT DE SAUSSURE IN HIS TRAIT6 SUR HYGROMETRIE HAS CITED THEM TEXTUALLY FROM WHENCE I EXTRACT

CAUSED THEIR PARIETES TO BECOME THINNER AND TO ASSUME COLOURS IN THE SANME WAY AS THE SOAPBUBBLE HE CALCULATED THEIR THICKNESSES ACCORDINGLY WHICH ON AN AVERAGE HE FOUND TO BE ABOUT 006MM DE SAUSSURE IN QUOTING THIS EXPERIMENT STATES THAT IT NEVER SUCCEEDED IN HIS HANDS FOR THE COLOURS WERE SIMUL  THBORIE DE L6LEVATION DES VAPEURS ET DES EXHALAISONS D6MONTR6 MATH6MATIQUEMENT PAR M GOTTLIEB KRATZENSTEIN BORDEAUX 1743 24ON THE SOCALLED VESICULAR VAPOURS OF WATER ETC TANEOUS AND NOT SUCCESSIVE AS IS REQUIRED THESE APPEARANCES ARE EASILY EXPLAINED IN THE PRESENT STATE OF SCIENCE WHICH COULD NOT BE DONE IN THE TIME OF KRATZENSTEIN THE CONDENSATION OF THE VAPOURS OF WATER IS CAUSED BY THE SUDDEN DEMAND FOR CALORIC BY THE RAREFIED AIR IN THE GLASS GLOBE AND THE SAME TAKES PLACE IN THE RECEIVER OF THE PNEUMATIC MACHINE WHEN THERE IS A COMMENCEMENT OF A VACUUM AS THE GAS WITHIN RECOVERS ITS CALORIC FROM SURROUNDING BODIES THE GLOBULAR VAPOURS AND THE MOISTURE DEPOSITED ON THE INNER SURFACE OF THE GLASS RECOVER THEIR ELASTIC CONDITION WITH REGARD TO THE COLOURS OBSERVED THEY ARE OWING TO THE DIFFRACTION OF LIGHT BY THE PARTICLES IN SUSPENSION AND MORE PARTICULARLY BY THOSE PARTS CONDENSED ON THE SIDES OF THE GLASS AS IN SOME OF FRAUNHOFERS EXPERIMENTS THEREFORE IT IS IN NO MANNER POSSIBLE TO CONNECT THESE COLOURS EITHER WITH THE THICKNESS OF THE VESICLES OR WITH THE VESICULAR THEORY I HAVE RELATED THESE EXPERIMENTS THUS FULLY BECAUSE I FIND THAT EVEN AT THE PRESENT DAY THEY STILL PASS CURRENT WITH OBSERVERS OF A DESERVEDLY HIGH REPUTATION THUS THEY ARE REPRODUCED IN KAEMTZS TREATISE ON METEOROLOGY PERHAPS THE MOST PRO FOUND WORK ON THE SCIENCE AND NOW RENDERED POPULAR IN THIS COUNTRY BY MR WALKERS TRANSLATION OF HIS MANUAL DE SAUSSURE ON EXAMINING WITH A LENS OF AN INCH FOCUS THE STEAM OF WATER FLOATING OVER A DARK SURFACE PIN SPEAKING OF THE VESICLES SAYS  LA LEGRET DE CES PETITES SPHERES LEUR BLANCHEUR LEUR APPARENCE ABSOLUMENT DIFFERENTE DE CELLES DES GLOBULES SOLIDES LEUR PARFAITE RESSEMBLANCE AVEC LES BULLES VOLUMINEUSES QUE LON VOIT NAGER A LA SURFACE DU LIQUIDE NE LAISSENT AUCUN DOUTE SUR LEUR NATURE IL SUFFIT DE LES VOIR POUR ETRE CONVAINCU QUE CE SONT DES SPHERES CREUSES SEMBLABLE H LA GROSSEUR PRAS S CELLES QUE LON FORME AVEC LEAU DE SAVON HE FURTHER STATES THAT HE CONFIRMED THESE IDEAS BY THE EXAMINATION OF FOGS OR CLOUDS ON HIGH MOUNTAINS WHEN HE WAS ENABLED TO PERCEIVE IN THE SAME WAY MINUTE VESICLES SOMETIMES ACCOMPANIED WITH DROPS OR GLOBULES OF WATER HE ESTIMATES THE SMALLEST AT 4OTH OF AN INCH AND THE LARGEST AT 2780TH WHEN THESE VESICLES CAME IN CONTACT THEY BURST AND FORMED A SMALL DROP OF WATER THESE EXPERIMENTS HAVE BEEN ADOPTED AND REPRODUCED BY MOST MODERN AUTHORS AMONG WHOM MAY BE MENTIONED BERZELIUS FRESNEL MITSCHER LICH C AS I HAVE ALREADY STATED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF REPEATING DE SAUSSURES OBSERVATIONS ON THE CLOUDS AT THE MONASTERY OF ST BERNARD I WILL QUOTE THE PASSAGE  GLOBULES OF VARIOUS SIZES ARE FREQUENTLY DISCERNED BY THE NAKED EYE FLOATING IN ALL DIRECTIONS I HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO ASCERTAIN THEIR VESICULAR STRUCTURE BUT HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DO SO FROM DIRECT OBSERVATIONS IT IS FREQUENTLY A MOST DIFFICULT POINT IN MICROSCOPIC INVESTIGATION TO DECIDE UPON THE EXISTENCE OF A THIN TRANSPARENT MEMBRANE IT IS STILL MORE SO TO PRONOUNCE UPON THE VESICULAR OR SPHERULAR STRUCTURE OF GLOBULES IN CONSTANT AGITATION AND I BELIEVE THAT IF MINUTE SPHERULES AND VESICLES COULD BE MIXED TOGETHER WE DO NOT POSSESS ANY MEANS AT PRESENT OF DISTINGUISHING THEM I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO DETECT THAT APPEARANCE MDCCCXLVII E 25DR A WALLERS MICROSCOPIC OBSERVATIONS OF BURSTING OF THE GLOBULES MENTIONED BY DE SAUSSURE BUT SOMETIMES WHEN THE AGITATION OF THE AIR IS SLIGHT TWO OF THE LARGER GLOBULES MAY BE SEEN FLOATING TOWARDS EACH OTHER AND AFTERWARDS DISAPPEAR SUDDENLY WHICH MAY BE EXPLAINED IF WE ADMIT THAT IT IS CAUSED BY THE UNION OF THE TWO SPHERULES INTO ONE WHICH IS TOO HEAVY TO REMAIN ANY LONGER IN SUSPENSION AND WHOSE RAPID DEPOSITION CONCEALS IT FROM THE SIGHT FROM THE COMMENCEMENT OF MY EXPERIMENTS I FOUND THAT THE GREATEST OBSTACLE TO A PERFECT INVESTIGATION OF THESE GLOBULES AROSE FROM THEIR EXCESSIVE MO BILITY EVEN TO THE NAKED EYE THIS IS VERY GREAT AND IS THE CAUSE OF SEVERAL OPTICAL DELUSIONS BUT BY THE USE OF MAGNIFYING INSTRUMENTS THIS MOBILITY MUST NECESSARILY BE INCREASED IN PROPORTION TO THEIR POWER WITH THE SIMPLE MICROSCOPE OF DE SAUS SURE A GLOBULE MIGHT OCCASIONALLY BE PERCEIVED AND ITS DCIAMNETER ESTITNATED TO A CERTAIN EXTENT BUT WITH THE COMPOUND ACHROMATIC MICROSCOPE I EMPLOY THEIR ANGULAR DISPLACEMENT IS TOO RAPID TO FORM ANY CORRECT SENSATION ON THE RETINA FOR THIS REASON I WAS LED TO ADOPT THE PLAN OF FIXING THE CONDENSED VAPOURS ARISING FROM THE BREATH OR OTHER SOURCES IN SOME LIQUID WHICH LIKE OIL POSSESSES NO AFFINITY FOR WATER THE LIQUIDSWITH WLLICH I THUS MIXED THE VAPOURS OF WATER WERE VERY NUMEROUS AND AS THE APPEARANCES THUS PRESENTED UNDER THE MICROSCOPE WERE NOT THE SAME IN ALL CASES I WILL ONLY MENTION SOME OF THE MOST INTERESTING CANADA BALSAM IS PERHAPS OF ALL OTHER VEHICLES THE MOST ADAPTED FOR THESE OBSERVA TIONS A SLIP OF GLASS COVERED WITH A THIN LAYER OF IT IS TO BE USED BY BREATHING ON IT WITH A LITTLE FORCE THE VAPOURS OF THE BREATH WILL NOT ONLY BE CONDENSED ON ITS SURFACE BUT WILL PENETRATE BELOW WHERE THEY MAY BE EASILY RECOGNIZED IN OPAKE STREAKS OF A WHITE COLOUR BY REASON OF THE VISCOUSNESS OF THE BALSAM THEY WILL REMAIN ALMOST STATIONARY FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR AND FOR A MUCH LONGER PERIOD IF COVERED WITH ANOTHER THIN PIECE OF GLASS OR TALC UNDER THE MICROSCOPE THESE STREAKS ARE DECOMN POSED INTO MINUTE GLOBULES PERFECTLY SPHERULAR LIKE SHOT OR THE GLOBULES OF MERCURY SEE PLATE II FIG 1 BB THEIR SIZES VARY WITHIN CERTAIN LIMITS BETWEEN WHICH THEY OCCUR OF ALL INTERMEDIATE SIZES THEY AGGLOMERATE TOGETHER IN VARIOUS WAYS FORMING LINES COMPOSED OF SEVERAL ROWS OF THEM TOUCHING EACH OTHER BUT WITHOUT ANY SIGNS OF COALESCING UNLESS ATTENTIVELY EXAMINED FOR SOME TIME WHEN TWO SMALLER ONES MAY BE PERCEIVED TO DISAPPEAR AND IN THEIR PLACE IS SEEN ANOTHER OF LARGER SIZE RESULTING FROM THEIR FUSION A CERTAIN DEGREE OF ATTRACTION EXISTS BETWEEN THEM AS THEY ARE GENERALLY PACKED TOGETHER AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE AND ANY HIATUS CAUSED BY ANY OF THEM COALESCING IS QUICKLY FILLED BY OTHERS THUS A GROUP WILL SOMETIMES HAVE ITS FORM MODIFIED AND REDUCED BY THEIR PRESSING INWARDS TO SUPPLY ANY HIATUS LEFT AFTER ONE OR TWO HAVE COALESCED ANOTHER PROOF OF THEIR MUTUAL ATTRACTION IS OFFERED IN THE MOVEMENT EN MASSE OF A SINGLE FILE OF GLOBULES WITHOUT THEIR SEPARATING FROM EACH OTHER IN FAVOURABLE CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE FOUND SOME OF THEM STILL IN  STATU QUO AFTER A LAPSE OF TWENTYFOUR HOURS OR MORE THEIR DIAMETERS VARY GENERALLY FROM 000 IMM TO 0O003MM THEY DISAPPEAR AT LENGTH BY ADHERING TO AND WETTING THE SURFACE OF THE GLASS ABOVE OR BELOW THEM WHERE THEY MAY EASILY ESCAPE NOTICE AS FROMI 260  S  H T X  V A  M 1  E EM B A    1 ILO THZI P MTZW DC CCC LVUITS7ALPZ    I  J  SJALE C2  B I  5AE W 5S VS J  ITIIH R SR SCAZE AVX IYZI 7    ID  I SCALENZ

LITTLE POWER TO DEVIATE THE LIGHT FIROM ITS REGULAR COURSE THEIR SHAPE IS VERY IRREGULAR GENERALLY OF AN ANGULAR AND FREQUENTLY OF AN HEXAGONAL FORM SEE FIG 1 AA THAT PART CONDENSED ON THE SURFACE OF THE BALSAM PRESENTS EXCEEDINGLY MINUTE GLOBULES OF THE SAME NATURE INSTEAD OF CONDENSING THE BREATH AS ABOVE I HAVE PLACED THE SLIP OF GLASS COVERED WITH BALSAM IN THE OPEN AIR ON GRASS COVERED WITH HOARFROST AND AFTER IT HAD BECOME SLIGHTLY TURBID ON ITS SURFACE FROM THE MOISTURE DEPOSITED I SUBMITTED IT TO THE MICROSCOPE IT WAS THEN SEEN TO BE COVERED WITH LINES OF SINGLE GLOBULES LIKE STRUNG BEADS FOLLOWING THE MOST TORTUOUS COURSES AND WHEREVER THE BALSAM HAD BEEN DIS TURBED BY THE PASSAGE OF ANY BODY THROUGH IT EVEN FOR A LONG TIME PREVIOUS TO THE EXPOSURE THE DIRECTION OF THESE LINES SHOWED THE MANNER IN WHICH IT HAD BEEN DIS TURBED THE DIAMETERS OF SOME OF THESE GLOBULES APPEARED AS MERE POINTS UNDER THE STRONGEST MAGNIFYING POWER AND WERE PROBABLY LESS THAN 00001MM AS THE GLASS BECAME WARM THE GLOBULES COALESCED AT INTERMEDIATE POINTS INTO A SINGLE ONE WHICH SOON VANISHED IN ITS TURN WHEN STEAM FROM BOILING WATER IN A GLASS TUBE WAS CONDENSED IN CANADA BALSCAM THE GLOBULES WHICH ARE REPRESENTED IN FIG 2 ARE MUCH NMORE VOLUMINOUS VARYING FROM 001L1M1 TO 0015MM THOUGH IN OTHER RESPECTS THEY WERE EXACTLY THE SAME THE GLOBULES ARISING FROM WATER AT 60 REAUMUR ARE THE SAME SIZE AS THOSE OF THE BREATH NO DOUBT CAN POSSIBLY BE ENTERTAINED AFTER HAVING INSPECTED THESE GLOBULES ATTEN TIVELY OF THEIR BEING PERFECT SPHERULES OF LIQUID WITHOUT ANY CENTRAL PART WHATEVER FOR CONTAINING A GASIFORM FLUID WHICH COULD NOT ESCAPE DETECTION WHEN THEY COALESCE AND ADHERE TO THE GLASS GLOBULES OF GAS OF WHATEVER NATURE CANNOT POSSIBLY BE CONFOUNDED WITH ONE OF THESE LIQUID GLOBULES FROM THEIR BEING MUCH DARKER AND THE SMALLEST OF THEM CONSIDERABLY LARGER THAN THOSE OF WATER INDEPENDENTLY OF THEIR REMAINING PERMANENT WHEN INCLOSED BETWEEN TWO SURFACES OF GLASS IN CANADA BALSAM THEY PRESENT ON A VERY NLINUTE SCALE THE EXACT REPRESENTATION OF EXTERNAL OBJECTS WHICH SURROUND THE MICROSCOPE WHICH HOWEVER IS SEEN ON LIQUID GLOBULES WHEN THEY ARE SUFFICIENTLY LARGE THUS IN LOOKING THROUGH THE MICROSCOPE I HAVE SEEN AT THE LOWER PART OF ONE OF THESE AIRGLOBULES PORTIONS OF MY OWN FACE OR BODY AND IN THE SAME WAY AN EXTENSIVE VIEW OF TREES HOUSES C MAY BE TRACED WITH ALL ITS DETAILS ON ONE OF THESE MICROSCOPIC GLOBULES NOT LARGER THAN 001MM OR 002M FIG 3 REPRESENTS THE IMAGE OF PART OF THE HAND AS SEEN IN A GLOBULE OF AIR DRAWN UNDER THE CAMERA LUCIDA I MENTION THIS FACT AS I BELIEVE THAT THE TELESCOPIC ACTION OF THE MICROSCOPE BY MEANS OF THESE HOLLOW PRISMS MAY BE CAPABLE OF SEVERAL INTERESTING APPLICATIONS BY BREATHING GENTLY ON THE SURFACE OF CANADA BALSAM IT WILL BECOME COVERED WITH A FILM OF MOISTURE REFLECTING VARIOUS COLOURS IN PROPORTION TO THE QUANTITY DEPOSITED ANY BRIGHT OBJECT VIEWED THROUGH IT WILL APPEAR SURROUNDED BY A HALO OF BRILLIANT COLOURS SUCH AS THOSE SEEN SOMETIMES ENCIRCLING THE SUN OR MOON THESE COLOURED FILMS UNDER THE MICROSCOPE ARE DECOMPOSED INTO COLOURLESS PARTICLES OF WATER WHICH E 2 2728 DR A WALLERS MICROSCOPIC OBSERVATIONS ARE ALL OF THE SAME FORM ALTHOUGH AN IRREGULAR ONE NOT COMPLETELY CIRCULAR IF A SURFACE OF BALSAM BE PLACED ASIDE FOR A SHORT TIME AND AFTERWARDS EXAMINED WE FIND THAT THESE PARTICLES WHICH BEFORE WERE DISPOSED IN A REGULAR MANNER APPEAR TO HAVE ALTERED THEIR POSITION AND THAT THEY HAVE GROUPED THEMSELVES IN RADIATING LINES TOWARDS A VARIETY OF POINTS SEE FIG 4 PARTICLES OF WATER MAY BE EXAMINED IN A SOLID AND CRYSTALLINE STATE A SLIP OF GLASS OR A SMALL GLASS TRAY COATED WITH CANADA BALSAM ON ITS UNDER SURFACE AND A FREEZING MIXTURE AT THE UPPER WILL GRADUALLY CONDENSE THE MOISTURE FROM THE AIR AND THE BALSAM WILL BECOME COVERED WITH THE WELLKNOWN SPONGY DEPOSIT OF FROZEN PAR TICLES THE MANNER IN WHICH THE CRYSTALLIZATION TAKES PLACE IS REMARKABLE AT FIRST THE MOISTURE CONDENSED IS LIQUID AND GLOBULAR IN FORM BUT AS THE REFRIGERATION CON TINUES A SUDDEN MOLECULAR CHANGE OCCURS AND THE GLOBULES ARE FOUND TO ASSUME VA RIOUS CRYSTALLINE SHAPES WHEN THEY ARE SMALL AND NUMEROUS ON CONSOLIDATING THEY FORM A KIND OF AREOLAR NETWORK THE APPEARANCE OF WHICH IS CAUSED BY THE REFLEXION OF NUMEROUS CRYSTALLINE FACETS SEE FIG 7 AT OTHER PLACES MAY BE SEEN SNALL PYRA MIDAL CRYSTALS COVERING A SOLID GLOBULAR NUCLEUS LIKE THE HEAD OF A MACE SOMETIMES THEY ASSUME THE FORM OF SMALL ACICULE OF HEXAGONAL PRISMS WITH VARIOUS SECONDARY FACETS OF OCTOHEDRONS C AT THE MOMENT WHEN THIS MOLECULAR ACTION TAKES PLACE I HAVE SOMETIMES PERCEIVED WITH THE MICROSCOPE A KIND OF FLITTING MOVEMENT AS THE GLOBULES ARE ASSUMING THEIR VARIOUS SHAPES LIKE THAT WHICH OCCURS IN THE CRYSTALLIZA TION OF PARTICLES FROM A STATE OF SOLUTION N THE GLOBULES WHICH COMPOSE MISTS OR FOGS MAY BE CONDENSED BY EXPOSING A SLIP OF GLASS COATED WITH BALSAM IN THE OPEN AIR BUT AS THE DEPOSITION TAKES PLACE VERY SLOWLY IT IS PREFERABLE TO EMPLOY THE ROTATORY BELLOWS SO PLACED AS TO THROW THE CURRENT OF AIR AT AN ANGLE OF ABOUT 60 ON THE PLATE STEAM OR OTHER VOLATILE SUB STANCES MAY BE CONDENSED IN THE SAME MANNER EN THE CURRENT IS CREATED BY THE COMMON BELLOWS I HAVE FOUND IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO FIX THE GLOBULES THOSE OB TAINED BY THIS PROCESS ARE EXACTLY SIMILAR TO THOSE OF STEAM IN MY EXPERIMENTS THEY WERE BETWEEN 002MM AND 003M1M IN SIZE ESSENCE OF TURPENTINE MAY BE USED IN THE SAME MANNER AS CANADA BALSAM THE GLOBULES CONDENSED IN THIS MANIFEST MUCH GREATER MOBILITY AS MIGHT BE EX PECTED FROM THE NATURE OF THE LIQUID FREQUENTLY REBOUNDING FROM EACH OTHER AS THEY COME IN COTTACT THEY DISAPPEAR VERY RAPIDLY EITHER BY ADHERING TO THE GLASS OR BY COALESCING TOGETHER I HAVE OBSERVED THEM MOVING IN VORTICES AROUND SEVERAL CENTRAL POINTS WHERE THEY RAPIDLY COLLAPSED THEIR DIAMETERS VARY BETWEEN THE  THE MOST FAVOURABLE SEASON FOR PERFORMING THESE EXPERIMENTS IS THE WINTER IN SUMMER WHEN THE AIR IS WARM AND LOADED WITH MOISTURE THE PARTICLES ON CONDENSING FORM LIQUID OR SOLID GLOBULES OR VERY CONFUSED CRYSTALS AND WHENEVER THE FREEZING MIXTURE IS MOVED ASIDE SO AS TO EXPOSE A PORTION OF THE UNER SURFACE TO MICROSCOPIC INSPECTION A VERY FEW MOMENTS SUFFICE FOR THE PARTICLES TO LIQUEFY SOLID GLOBULES MAY BE DISTIN GUISHED FROM LIQUID ONES BY THEIR BORDERS BEING MUCH DARKER AND FROM THEIR FREQUENTLY CONTAINING SMALLER GLOBULES AS IN FIG 8ON THE SOCALLED VESICULAR VAPOURS OF WATER ETC 0001MM AND THE 0003MM ESSENCE OF TURPENTINE IS STILL BETTER ADAPTED THAN THE BALSAM FOR RETAINING THE GLOBULES SUSPENDED IN THE AIR AS IN FOGS C WHEN AFTER HAVING BEEN COOLED BELOW THE COMMON TEMPERATURE IT IS BREATHED UPON A WHITISH PRECIPITATE OF A STREAKY APPEARANCE IS FORMED LIKE AN INSOLUBLE SALT WHICH SLOWLY DESCENDS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE VESSEL WHERE IT COALESCES INTO LARGER GLOBULES  THIS IS ALSO THE CASE WITH WATERGLOBULES CONDENSED IN THIS WAY FROM THE AIR WHICH FORM A CLOUDY PRECIPITATE INTERCEPTING THE PASSAGE OF LIGHT ON BEING PRESERVED IN A BOTTLE THIS CLOUD WILL STILL REMAIN AFTER THE LAPSE OF A COUPLE OF DAYS WHEN THE WATER WILL BE FOUND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE VESSEL IN A GLOBULAR SHAPE LIKE METALLIC MERCURY WITHOUT ADHERING TO THE SIDES OF THE GLASS BY MEANS OF THIS PERMANENT CLOUD WE MIGHT BE ENABLED TO PERFORM A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS OF GREAT INTEREST TO METEOROLOGY IN THIS WAY WE MIGHT DETERMINE THE INFLUENCE OF WATERGLOBULES OF VARIOUS SIZES IN THE PAS SAGE OF LUMINOUS THERMIC AND CHEMICAL RAYS COPAIVA BALSAM UPON BEING BREATHED UPON BECOMES COATED WITH A MILKY FILM WHICH TO THE NAKED EYE ASSUMES A RETICULATED APPEARANCE AFTER A FEW MOMENTS WHICH IS CAUSED BY THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE FILM SOONER AT SOME POINTS THAN AT OTHERS UNDER THE MICROSCOPE THE UNIFORM FILM IS DECOMPOSED INTO MINUTE GLOBULES WHICH OCCUPY THE SPACE OF MERE POINTS UNDER THE STRONGEST MAGNIFYING POWER THEY DIS APPEAR VERY RAPIDLY BY AGGLOMERATING AND FORMING LARGER GLOBULES THIS PROCESS OF AGGLOMERATION COMMENCES SIMULTANEOUSLY ON THE SURFACE OF THE LIQUID AT A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT POINTS FROM THESE IT PROCEEDS TO FORM CIRCULAR AREAS WHICH CONTINUE TO EXTEND UNTIL THEIR LINE OF DEMARCATION CONSISTS OF MERELY A SINGLE ROW OF GLOBULES WHICH ALSO IN THEIR TURN CONTRACT AND COALESCE INTO SMALL GROUPS OF ABOUT A DOZEN SEPA RATE SPHERULES AT THIS TIME THE PROCESS OF FUSION CEASES AND THE GLOBULES ARE SEEN SUDDENLY TO FLY APART IN VIRTUE OF SOME MOLECULAR REPULSION AND THEN GRADUALLY DIS APPEAR WITH BOILING WATER THE LIKE PHENOMENA ARE PRODUCED EXCEPT THAT THE GLO BULES ARE ALL MUCH LARGER IN FIG 5 ARE SEEN THESE ACTIONS IN ALL THEIR DIFFERENT STAGES OIL OF PEPPERMINT CONDENSES MOISTURE WHICH PRESENTS PHENOMENA VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE OF COPAIVA BALSAM IF THE BREATH BE PASSED THROUGH A NARROW TUBE A SYSTEM OF RAYS IS PRODUCED COMPOSED OF SEPARATE GLOBULES WHICH REMIND ONE OF THE FORM OF SOME OF THE SPECIES OF ASTERIAS WHICH RADIATE FROM A CENTRE AND ARE LIKEWISE COM POSED OF A MULTITUDE OF SEPARATE GLOBULAR PIECES THE IRISATED COLOURS FORMED ON THIS OIL ARE VERY BRILLIANT BUT SOON DISAPPEAR UNLESS THE CURRENT OF AIR IS CONSTANTLY KEPT UP THE PARTICLES OF WATER WHICH GIVE RISE TO THESE COLOURS DISAPPEAR BY IMMERSION INTO THE OIL AS WELL AS WITH ALL THE OTHER OILS WHICH ARE SUSCEPTIBLE OF PRESENTING THEM THE OILS OF ANETHUM CARRAWAY AND CAJEPUT ALSO PRESENTVERY SIMILAR APPEAR ANCES  A BOTTLE CONTAINING CONDENSED WATERGLOBULES AND ESSENCE OF TURPENTINE EXPOSED NIGHT AND DAY IN A NORTHERN ASPECT BECAME COATED AT ITS INNER SURFACE ON THE NORTH SIDE WITH CONDENSED MOISTURE AND AROUND THIS WITH TRANSPARENT ACICULAR CRYSTALS ARRANGED IN ZONES AROUND THE MOISTURE THE CRYSTALS WERE NOT OBTAINED IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITY TO ADMIT OF THEIR BEING ANALYSED

SPECTRAL COLOURS CASTOR OILTHE CONDENSED PARTICLES OF WATER PRESENT THE SAME APPEARANCE TO THE NAKED EYE OR WHEN ASSISTED BY THE MICROSCOPE AS THE TWO PRECEDING IF BEFORE THE GLOBULES HAVE DISAPPEARED

THEM UPON MINUTE FILAMENTS SUCH AS THOSE OF THE SPIDERS WEB I HAVE FOUND IT MOST CONVENIENT TO EMPLOY THE FILAMENTS WHICH CONTAIN THE OVA OF THE SPIDER OR THOSE OF THE COCOON OF THE SILKWORM THIN BUNDLES OF EITHER OF THESE EXPOSED TO STEAMN FROM BOILING WATER WERE FOUND AFTER A FEW MOMENTS TO HAVE VERY MINUTE GLOBULLES CONDENSED UPON THEM MOSTLY IMPERCEPTIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AS THOSE OBTAINED IN CANADA BALSAM FROM BOILING WATER THESE PARTICLES OF WATER WERE ALL LIQUID GLOBULES WITHOUT ANY SIGNS OF VESICULAR STRUCTURE IN FOGGY WEATHER THE FILAMENTS OF THE SPIDERS WEB GENERALLY BECOME COVERED WITH SMALL GLOBULES OF WATER WHICH IN SOME CASES ARE SO MINUTE AS TO GIVE THE FILAMENT A GREY WHITISH ASPECT LIKE GLOBULES FLOATING IN THE AIR OR IN SPIRIT OF TURPENTINE THESE FILAMENTS FIXED BETWEEN TWO SMALL FRAMES PRESSED CLOSE TOGETHER MAY BE EXAMINED UNDER THE MICROSCOPE THEY ARE THEN SEEN COVERED WITH GLOBULES OF WATER AND WITH OTHERS OF AN ORGANIC NATURE SECRETED BYTHE SPIDER THE FORMER MAY READILY BE DISTINGUISHED BY THEIR QUICK EVAPORATION FROM THE OTHERS WHICH ARE PERMANENT THE GLOBULES OF WATER WERE ABOUT 0O02MM WE MAY THEREFORE CONCLUDE FROM THE FOREGOING OBSERVATIONS THAT THE TERM VESICULAR STRUCTURE OF GLOBULES WHICH WAS FIRST PROPOSED AT A TIME WHEN THE KNOWLEDGE OF GASEOUS BODIES WAS STILL IN ITS INFANCY HAS BEEN ADOPTED WITHOUT SUFFICIENT FOUNDATION THAT THE EXPERIMENTS ON WHICH IT WAS GROUNDED WERE UNSATISFACTORY AND IMPERFECT AND THAT WHENEVER WE ARE ENABLED TO INSPECT THE MINUTEST PARTICLES OF WATER ARISING FROM CONDENSED STEAM OR VAPOUR THEY CONSIST OF MINUTE LIQUID GLOBULES WITHOUT ANY APPEARANCE OF INTERNAL CAVITY KENSINGTON APRIL 12TH 1846 30

read with interest two recent com munications1 in SCIENCE relative to the meet ing place of the different scientific societies with which I am heartily in accord To me the only valid objection to holding these meet ings at the time and place of the American Association is the tendency of the different meetings to conflict with one another This difficulty should be to a great extent obviated if the executive commnittees of related societies for example zoologists naturalists anato mists were to jointly arrange the program for their societies allowing this program if necessary to include the day preceding or fol lowing those on which the general association meets Certainly this difficulty was not obvi ated last year when the three societies above named met at Princeton the meetings of zoologists and anatomists distinctly conflict ing with each other On the other hand the great objections as it seems to me of holding these meetings at different places and at the same time is the entire loss of the benefits of the general association by those who wish to attend the sectional meetings Speaking per sonally I was much disappointed to miss the Sigma Xi convention at Washington last year in order to attend the zoologists meeting at Princeton To one living at some distance 1Morse Max SCIENCE December 22 1911 Reese A M SCIENCE January 12 1912 497 from the heart of things a trip to the annual meetings involves a considerable sacrifice of time and money and he feels like getting the largest return possible for such sacrifice which was not possible for all of us with the meetings arranged as they were last year If the present policy of aloofness on the part of certain societies be deemed desirable in fu ture might it not at least be possible to ar range the sectional meetings so as not to con flict with those of the general association In the case of a society with eastern and central branches viz zoologists where the majority of the members belong to the former branch I believe it would be fair to all to hold two eastern meetings to each one in the central district such meetings to be joint meetings of the two branches Separate meetings by each branch seem to me unde sirable at least if such meetings are held at the same time as was the case with the zool ogists in 1910 R T YOUNG UNIVERSITY OF NORTH DAKOTA THE TIDAL MACHINE TO THE EDITOR OF SCIENCE The undersigned desires to say that the machine described in the issue of this journal of February 23 1912 under the name of The Harris Tidal Ma chine is the product of one of the bureaus of this government the Coast and Geodetic Survey The officials of that bureau who are well acquainted with all the details of its development from first inception to final com pletion named it The Coast and Geodetic Survey Tide Predicting Machine Under that name it was described briefly in the Journal of the Washington Academy of Sci ences July 19 1911 and more fully with illustrations in Engineering News of July 20 1911 E G FISCHER WASHINGTON D C February 26 1912 REPLYING to Mr Fischers note concerning my article on The Harris Tidal Machine published in this journal on February 23 MARCH 29 1912N S VOL XXXV No 900 1912 I wish to state that to the best of my knowledge and belief no  christening of the machine has yet taken place if it has I am morally certain that the inventor was not in vited to the ceremony As the title The Coast and Geodetic Survey Tide Predicting Machine used by Mr Fischer is not only lengthy but includes the Ferrell Machine used by the office for many years the title under which I described it is logical in that it differentiates the Harris Machine from its predecessor at the same time serving as a mark of honor to its inventor I wrote three letters to the Coast Survey Office protesting against the injustice done Dr Harris in Mr Fischers article in Engineering News of July 20 1911 and calling attention to the misstatements contained therein re questing that the office publish suitable cor rective notes My letters were unanswered and I therefore laid the facts before the pub lic in my article SAMUEL TIERNEY JR QUOTATIONS DR WILEY AND THE BUREAU OF CHEMISTRY ON the 9th of April 1883 I took the oath of office and entered upon the discharge of my duties as chief of the Bureau of Chemistry in the Department of Agriculture For the past twentynine years I have endeavored to dis charge these duties according to the dictates of my conscience the knowledge at my com mand and the obligations of my oath In retiring from this position after so many years of service it seems fitting that I should state briefly the causes which have led me to this step Without going into detail respecting these causes I desire to say that the funda mental one is that I believe I can find oppor tunity for better and more effective service to the work which is nearest my heart namely the pure food and drug propaganda as a private citizen than I could any longer do in my late position In this action I do not intend in any way to reflect upon the position which has been taken by my superior officers in regard to the same problems I accord to them the same right to act in accordance with their convic tions which I claim for myself After a quarter of a century of constant discussion and effort the bill regulating inter state and foreign commerce in foods and drugs was enacted into law Almost from the very beginning of the enforcement of this act I dis covered that my point of view in regard to it was fundamentally different from that of any of my superiors in office For nearly six years there has been a growing feeling in my mind that these differences were irreconcilable and I have been conscious of an official environ ment which has been essentially inhospitable I saw the fundamental principles of the food and drugs act as they appeared to me one by one paralyzed and discredited It was the plain provision of the act and was fully understood at the time of the enactment as stated in the law itself that the Bureau of Chemistry was to examine all samples of sus pected foods and drugs to determine whether they were adulterated or misbranded and that if this examination disclosed such facts the matter was to be referred to the courts for decision Interest after interest engaged in what the Bureau of Chemistry found to be the manu facture of misbranded or adulterated foods and drugs made an appeal to escape appearing in court to defend their practises Various methods were employed to secure this many of which were successful One by one I found that the activities pertaining to the Bureau of Chemistry were restricted and various forms of manipulated food products were withdrawn from its consideration and referred either to other bodies not contemplated by law or di rectly relieved from further control A few of the instances of this kind are well known Among these may be mentioned the manufacture of socalled whiskey from alco hol colors and flavors the addition to food products of benzoic acid and its salts of sul phurous acid and its salts of sulphate of copper of saccharin and of alum the manu facture of socalled wines from pomace chem icals and colors the floating of oysters often in polluted waters for the purpose of making 498 SCIENCE

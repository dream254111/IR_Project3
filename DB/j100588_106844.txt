J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,106844,OBSERVATIONS ON THE SUGAR ANTS IN A LETTER FROM JOHN CASTLES ESQ TO LIEUT GEN MELVILL F R S,I206945,346 XIX OBSERVATIONS ON THE SUGAR ANTS IN A LETTER FROM JOHN CASTLES ESQ TO LIEUT GEN MELVILL F R S READ MAY 22 1790 T H E SUGAR ANTS SO CALLED FROM THEIR RUINOUS EFFECTS ON THE SUGARCANE FIRST MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN GRENADA ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO ON A SUGAR PLANTATION AT PETIT HAVRE A BAY FIVE OR SIX MILES FROM THE TOWN OF ST GEORGE THE CAPITAL CONVENIENTLY SITUATED FOR SMUGGLING FROM MARTINIQUE IT WAS THEREFORE CONCLUDED THEY WERE BROUGHT FROM THENCE IN SOME VESSEL EMPLOYED IN THAT TRADE WHICH IS VERY PROBABLE AS COLONIES OF THEM IN LIKE MANNER WERE AFTERWARDS PROPAGATED IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE ISLAND BY DROGHERS OR VESSELS EMPLOYED IN CARRYING STORES C FROM ONE PART OF THE ISLAND TO ANOTHER FROM THENCE THEY CONTINUED TO EXTEND THEMSELVES ON ALL SIDES FOR SEVERAL YEARS DESTROYING IN SUCCESSION EVERY SUGAR PLANTATION BETWEEN ST GEORGES AND ST JOHNS A SPACE OF ABOUT TWELVE MILES AT THE SAME TIME COLONIES OF THEM BEGAN TO BE OBSERVED IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE ISLAND PARTICULARLY AT DUQUESNE ON THE NORTH AND CALAVINI ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF IT ALL ATTEMPTS OF THE PLANTERS TO PUT A STOP TO THE RAVAGES OF THESE INSECTS HAVING BEEN FOUND INEFFECTUAL IT WELL BECAME THE LEGISLATURE TO OFFER GREAT PUBLIC REWARDS TO ANY WHO SHOULD DIS COVER A PRACTICABLE METHOD OF DESTROYING THEM SO AS TO PERMIT THE CULTIVATION OF THE SUGARCANE AS FORMERLY ACCORDINGLY 7 ANMR CASTLESS OBSERVATIONS C 347 AN ACT WAS PASSED BY WHICH SUCH DISCOVERER WAS ENTITLED TO TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS TO BE PAID FROM THE PUBLIC TREASURY OF THE ISLAND MANY WERE THE CANDIDATES ON THIS OCCASION BUT VERY FAR WERE ANY OF THEM FROM HAVING ANY JUST CLAIM NEVERTHELESS CONSIDERABLE SUMS OF MONEY WERE GRANTED IN CONSIDERATION OF TROUBLE AND EXPENCES IN MAKING EXPERIMENTS IN GRENADA THERE HAD ALWAYS BEEN SEVERAL SPECIES OF ANTS DIFFERING IN SIZE COLOUR C WHICH HOWEVER WERE PERFECTLY INNOCENT WITH RESPECT TO THE SUGARCANE THE ANTS IN QUESTION ON THE CONTRARY WERE NOT ONLY HIGHLY INJURIOUS TO IT BUT TO SEVERAL SORTS OF TREES SUCH AS THE LIME LEMON ORANGE C THESE ANTS ARE OF THE MIDDLE SIZE OF A SLENDER MAKE OF A DARK RED COLOUR AND REMARKABLE FOR THE QUICKNESS OF THEIR MOTIONS BUT THEIR GREATEST PECULIARITIES WERE THEIR TASTE WHEN APPLIED TO THE TONGUE THE IMMENSITY OF THEIR NUMBER AND THEIR CHOICE OF PLACES FOR THEIR NESTS ALL THE OTHER SPECIES OF ANTS IN GRENADA HAVE A BITTER MUSKY TASTE THESE ON THE CONTRARY ARE ACID IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE AND WHEN A NUMBER OF THEM WERE RUBBED TOGETHER BETWEEN THE PALMS OF THE HANDS THEY EMITTED A STRONG VITRIOLIC SUL PHUREOUS SMELL SO MUCH SO THAT WHEN THIS EXPERIMENT WAS MADE A GENTLEMAN CONCEIVED THAT IT MIGHT BE OWING TO THIS QUALITY THAT THESE INSECTS WERE SO UNFRIENDLY TO VEGETATION THIS CRITERION TO DISTINGUISH THEM WAS INFALLIBLE AND KNOWN TO EVERY ONE THEIR NUMBERS WERE INCREDIBLE I HAVE SEEN THE ROADS COLOURED BY THEM FOR MILES TOGETHER AND SO CROWDED WERE THEY IN MANY PLACES THAT THE PRINT OF THE HORSES FEET WOULD APPEAR FOR A MOMENT OR TWO TILL FILLED UP BY THE SURROUNDING MULTI TUDE THIS IS NO EXAGGERATION ALL THE OTHER SPECIES OF ANTS Z Z 2 ALTHOUGH348 MR CASTLESS OBSERVATIONS ON ALTHOUGH NUMEROUS WERE CIRCUMSCRIBED AND CONFINED TO A SMALL SPOT IN PROPORTION TO THE SPACE OCCUPIED BY THE CANE ANTS AS A MOLE HILL TO A MOUNTAIN THE COMMON BLACK ANTS OF THAT COUNTRY HAD THEIR NESTS ABOUT THE FOUNDATION OF HOUSES OR OLD WALLS OTHERS IN HOLLOW TREES AND A LARGE SPECIES IN THE PASTURES DESCENDING BY A SMALL APERTURE UNDER GROUND THE SUGAR ANTS I BELIEVE UNIVERSALLY CONSTRUCTED THEIR NESTS AMONG THE ROOTS OF PARTICULAR PLANTS AND TREES SUCH AS THE SUGARCANE LIME LEMON AND ORANGE TREES C THE DESTRUCTION OF THESE ANTS WAS ATTEMPTED CHIEFLY TWO WAYS BY POISON AND THE APPLICATION OF FIRE FOR THE FIRST PURPOSE ARSENIC AND CORROSIVE SUBLIMATE MIXED WITH ANIMAL SUBSTANCES SUCH AS SALT FISH HERRINGS CRABS AND OTHER SHELLFISH C WERE USED WHICH WAS GREEDILY DEVOURED BY THEM MYRIADS OF THEM WERE THUS DESTROYED AND THE MORE SO AS IT WAS OBSERVED BY A MAGNIFYING GLASS AND INDEED THOUGH NOT SO DISTINCTLY BY THE NAKED EYE THAT CORROSIVE SUBLIMATE HAD THE EFFECT OF RENDERING THEM SO OUTRAGEOUS THAT THEY DESTROYED EACH OTHER AND THAT EFFECT WAS PRODUCED EVEN BY COMING INTO CONTACT WITH IT BUT IT IS CLEAR AND IT WAS FOUND THAT THESE POISONS COULD NOT BE LAID IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES OVER SO LARGE A TRACT OF LAND AS TO GIVE THE HUNDREDTHOUSANDTH PART OF THEM A TASTE AND CONSEQUENTLY THEY PROVED INADEQUATE TO THE TASK THE USE OF FIRE AFFORDED A GREATER PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS FOR FROM WHATEVER CAUSE IT WAS OBSERVED THAT IF WOOD BURNT TO THE STATE OF CHARCOAL WITHOUT FLAME AND IMMEDIATELY TAKEN FROM THE FIRE WAS LAID IN THEIR WAY THEY CROWDED TO IT IN SUCH AMAZING NUMBERS AS SOON TO EXTINGUISH IT ALTHOUGH WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF THOUSANDS OF THEM IN EFFECTING IT THIS PART OF THEIRTHE SUGAR ANTS 349 THEIR HISTORY APPEARS SCARCELY CREDIBLE BUT ON MAKING THE EXPERIMENT MYSELF I FOUND IT LITERALLY TRUE I LAID FIRE AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WHERE THERE APPEARED BUT A VERY FEW ANTS AND IN THE COURSE OF A FEW MINUTES THOUSANDS WERE SEEN CROWDING TO IT AND UPON IT TILL IT WAS PERFECTLY COVERED BY THEIR DEAD BODIES HOLES WERE THEREFORE DUG AT PROPER DISTANCES IN A CANE PIECE AND FIRE MADE IN EACH OF THEM PRODIGIOUS QUANTITIES PERISHED IN THIS WAY FOR THOSE FIRES WHEN EXTINGUISHED AP PEARED IN THE SHAPE OF MOLE HILLS FROM THE NUMBERS OF THEIR DEAD BODIES HEAPED ON THEM NEVERTHELESS THEY SOON APPEARED AGAIN AS NUMEROUS AS EVER THIS MAY BE ACCOUNTED FOR NOT ONLY FROM THEIR AMAZING FECUNDITY BUT THAT PROBABLY NONE OF THE BREEDING ANTS OR YOUNG BROOD SUFFERED FROM THE EXPERIMENT FOR THE SAME REASON THE MOMENTARY GENERAL APPLICATION OF FIRE BY BURNING THE CANE TRASH OR STRAW OF THE CANE AS IT LAY ON THE GROUND PROVED AS LITTLE EFFECTUAL FOR ALTHOUGH PERHAPS MULTITUDES OF ANTS MIGHT HAVE BEEN DESTROYED YET IN GENERAL THEY WOULD ESCAPE BY RETIRING TO THEIR NESTS UNDER COVER AND OUT OF ITS REACH AND THE BREEDING ANTS WITH THEIR YOUNG PROGENY MUST HAVE REMAINED UNHURT MR SMEATHMAN WHO WROTE A PAPER ON THE TERMITES OR WHITE ANTS OF AFRICA AND WAS AT GRENADA AT THIS TIME IMAGINED THAT THESE ANTS WERE NOT THE CAUSE OF THE INJURY DONE TO THE CANES HE SUPPOSED IT WAS OWING TO THE BLAST A DISEASE THE CANES ARE SUBJECT TO SAID TO ARISE FROM A SPECIES OF SMALL FLIES GENERATED ON THEIR STEMS AND LEAVES AND THAT THE ANTS WERE ATTRACTED IN SUCH MULTITUDES MERELY TO FEED ON THEM THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT WHERE THIS BLAST EXISTED IT CONSTITUTED PART OF THE FOOD OF THE ANTS BUT THIS THEORY WAS OVERTHROWN BY OBSERVING THAT BY FAR THE GREATEST PART OF THE INJURED CANES HAD NO APPEARANCE OF THAT SORT BUT BECAME SICKLY AND WITHERED350 MR CASTLESS OBSERVATIONS ON WITHERED APPARENTLY FOR WANT OF NOURISHMENT BESIDES HAD THAT BEEN THE CASE THE CANES MUST HAVE BEEN BENEFITED INSTEAD OF BEING HURT BY THESE INSECTS FOR THE CURE OF THE BLAST HE PROPOSED THE APPLICATION OF TRAIN OIL WHICH HAD NOT THE LEAST EFFECT IN PREVENTING THE MIS CHIEF AND IF IT HAD COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN GENERALLY ENOUGH USED TO ANSWER THE PURPOSE THIS CALAMITY WHICH RESISTED SO LONG THE EFFORTS OF THE PLANTERS WAS AT LENGTH REMOVED BY ANOTHER WHICH HOWEVER RUINOUS TO THE OTHER ISLANDS IN THE WEST INDIES AND IN OTHER RESPECTS WAS TO GRENADA A VERY GREAT BLESSING NAMELY THE HUR RICANE IN 1780 WITHOUT WHICH IT IS PROBABLE THE CULTIVATION OF THE SUGARCANE IN THE MOST VALUABLE PARTS OF THAT ISLAND MUST HAVE IN A GREAT MEASURE BEEN THROWN ASIDE AT LEAST FOR SOME YEARS HOW THIS HURRICANE PRODUCED THIS EFFECT HAS BEEN CONSIDERED RATHER AS A MATTER OF WONDER AND SURPRIZE THAN ATTEMPTED TO BE EXPLAINED BY ATTENDING TO THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS THE DIFFICULTY I BELIEVE WILL BE REMOVED THESE ANTS MAKE THEIR NESTS OR CELLS FOR THE RECEPTION OF THEIR EGGS ONLY UNDER OR AMONG THE ROOTS OF SUCH TREES OR PLANTS AS ARE NOT ONLY CAPABLE OF PROTECTING THEM FROM HEAVY RAINS BUT ARE AT THE SAME TIME SO FIRM IN THE GROUND AS TO AFFORD A SECURE BASIS TO SUPPORT THEM AGAINST ANY INJURY OCCASIONED BY THE AGITATION OF THE USUAL WINDS THIS DOUBLE QUALIFICATION THE SUGARCANE POSSESSES IN A VERY GREAT DEGREE FOR A STOOL OF CANES WHICH IS THE ASSEMBLAGE OF ITS NUMEROUS ROOTS WHERE THE STEMS BEGIN TO SHOOT OUT IS ALMOST IMPENETRABLE TO RAIN AND IS ALSO FROM THE AMAZING NUMBERS AND EXTENSION OF THE ROOTS FIRMLY FIXED TO THE GROUND THUS WHEN EVERY OTHER PART OF THE FIELD IS DRENCHED WITH RAIN THE GROUND UNDER THOSE STOOLS WILL BE FOUND QUITE DRY AS I AND EVERY OTHER PLANTER MUST HAVE OBSERVEDTHE SUGAR ANTS 351 OBSERVED WHEN DIGGING OUT THE STOOLS IN A CANE PIECE TO PRE PARE FOR REPLANTING AND WHEN CANES ARE LODGED OR LAID DOWN BY THE USUAL WINDS OR FROM THEIR OWN LUXURIANCY THE STOOLS COMMONLY REMAIN IN THE GROUND HENCE IN ORDINARY WEATHER THEIR NESTS ARE IN A STATE OF PERFECT SECURITY THE LIME LEMON ORANGE AND SOME OTHER TREES AFFORD THESE INSECTS THE SAME ADVANTAGES FROM THE GREAT NUMBER AND QUALITY OF THEIR ROOTS WHICH ARE FIRMLY FIXED TO THE EARTH AND ARE VERY LARGE BESIDES WHICH THEIR TOPS ARE SO VERY THICK AND UMBRAGEOUS AS TO PREVENT EVEN A VERY HEAVY RAIN FROM REACHING THE GROUND UNDERNEATH ON THE CONTRARY THESE ANTS NESTS ARE NEVER FOUND AT THE ROOTS OF TREES OR PLANTS INCAPABLE OF AFFORDING THE ABOVE PROTECTION SUCH FOR INSTANCE IS THE COFFEE TREE IT IS INDEED SUFFICIENTLY FIRM IN THE GROUND BUT IT HAS ONLY ONE LARGE TAP ROOT WHICH GOES STRAIGHT DOWNWARDS AND ITS LATERAL ROOTS ARE SO SMALL AS TO AFFORD NO SHELTER AGAINST RAIN SO AGAIN THE ROOTS OF THE COTTON SHRUB RUN TOO NEAR THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH TO PREVENT THE ACCESS OF RAIN AND ARE NEITHER SUFFICIENTLY PERMANENT NOR FIRM ENOUGH TO RESIST THE AGITATION BY THE USUAL WINDS THE SAME OBSERVATION WILL BE FOUND TRUE WITH RESPECT TO COCAO PLANTAINS MAIZE TOBACCO INDIGO AND MANY OTHER SPECIES OF TREES AND PLANTS TREES OR PLANTS OF THE FIRST DESCRIPTION ALWAYS SUFFER MORE OR LESS IN LANDS INFESTED WITH THESE ANTS WHEREAS THOSE OF THE LATTER NEVER DO HENCE WE MAY FAIRLY CONCLUDE THAT THE MIS CHIEF DONE BY THESE INSECTS IS OCCASIONED ONLY BY THEIR LODGING AND MAKING THEIR NESTS ABOUT THE ROOTS OF PARTICULAR TREES OR PLANTS THUS THE ROOTS OF THE SUGARCANES ARE SOMEHOW OR OTHER SO MUCH INJURED BY THEM AS TO BE INCAPABLE OF PERFORM ING THEIR OFFICE OF SUPPLYING DUE NOURISHMENT TO THE PLANTS WHICH352 MR CASTLESS OBSERVATIONS ON WHICH THEREFORE BECOME SICKLY AND STINTED AND CONSEQUENTLY DO NOT AFFORD JUICES FIT FOR MAKING SUGAR IN EITHER TOLERABLE QUANTITY OR QUALITY THAT THESE ANTS DO NOT FEED ON ANY PART OF THE CANES OR TREES AFFECTED SEEMS VERY CLEAR FOR NO LOSS OF SUBSTANCE IN EITHER THE ONE OR THE OTHER HAS EVER BEEN OBSERVED NOR HAVE THEY EVER BEEN SEEN CARRYING OFF VEGETABLE SUBSTANCES OF ANY SORT THE TRUTH OF THIS WILL FARTHER APPEAR BY THE FOLLOWING FACT A VERY FINE LIMETREE IN THE PASTURE OF MOUNT WILLIAM ESTATE AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM ANY CANES BUT NEAR THE DWELLING HOUSE HAD SICKENED AND DIED SOON AFTER THE ANTS MADE THEIR APPEARANCE ON THAT ESTATE AFTER IT HAD REMAINED IN THAT STATE WITHOUT A SINGLE LEAF OR THE LEAST VERDURE FOR SEVERAL MONTHS ON EXAMINATION A VERY FEW ANTS APPEARED ABOUT IT BUT WHEN WITH THE MANAGERS PERMISSION IT WAS GRUBBED OUT A MOST ASTONISHING QUANTITY OF ANTS AND ANTS NESTS FULL OF EGGS WERE FOUND ABOUT ITS ROOTS ALL OF WHICH WERE QUITE DEAD AND MANY OF THEM ROTTEN THAT THIS TREE CONSTITUTED NO PART OF THEIR FOOD IS QUITE CERTAIN BUT WHILE IT CONTINUED TO AFFORD THEM PROPER SECURITY FOR THEIR NESTS THEY STILL CONTINUED THEIR ABODE ON THE CONTRARY THERE IS THE GREATEST PRESUMPTION THAT THESE ANTS ARE CARNIVOROUS AND FEED ENTIRELY ON ANIMAL SUBSTANCES FOR IF A DEAD INSECT OR ANIMAL FOOD OF ANY SORT WAS LAID IN THEIR WAY IT WAS IMMEDIATELY CARRIED OFF IT WAS FOUND ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO PRESERVE COLD VICTUALS FROM THEM THE LARGEST CARCASSES AS SOON AS THEY BEGAN TO BECOME PUTRID SO AS THAT THEY COULD SEPARATE THE PARTS SOON DISAPPEARED NEGROES WITH SORES HAD DIFFICULTY TO KEEP THE ANTS FROM THE EDGES OF THEM THEY DESTROYED ALL OTHER VERMIN RATS IN PARTICULAR OF WHICH THEY CLEARED EVERY PLANTATION THEY CAME UPON WHICH THEY PROBABLY EFFECTEDTHE SUGAR ANIS 353 EFFECTED BY ATTACKING THEIR YOUNG IT WAS FOUND THAT POULTRY OR OTHER SMALL STOCK COULD BE RAISED WITH THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY AND THE EYES NOSE AND OTHER EMUNCTORIES OF THE BODIES OF DYING OR DEAD ANIMALS WERE INSTANTLY COVERED WITH THEM IN THE YEAR 1780 MANY OF THE SUGAR ESTATES WHICH HAD BEEN FIRST INFESTED WITH THESE ANTS HAD BEEN EITHER ABANDONED OR PUT INTO OTHER KINDS OF PRODUCE PRINCIPALLY COTTON WHICH AS I HAVE ABOVE OBSERVED DO NOT AFFORD CONVENIENCY FOR THEIR NESTS IN CONSEQUENCE THE ANTS HAD THERE SO MUCH DECREASED IN NUMBER THAT THE CULTIVATION OF SUGAR HAD AGAIN BEGUN TO BE REASSUMED BUT IT WAS VERY DIFFERENT IN THOSE PLANTATIONS WHICH HAD BUT LATELY BEEN ATTACKED AND WERE STILL IN SUGAR AT DUQUESNE PARTICULARLY AT THAT TIME THEY WERE PERNICIOUS IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE SPREADING THEMSELVES ON ALL SIDES WITH GREAT RAPIDITY WHEN A SUDDEN STOP WAS PUT TO THEIR PROGRESS BY THE HURRICANE WHICH HAPPENED NEAR THE MIDDLE OF OCTOBER THAT YEAR HOW THIS WAS EFFECTED I THINK MAY BE EXPLAINED BY ATTENDING TO THE ABOVE OBSERVATIONS FROM WHAT HAS BEEN SAID IT APPEARS THAT A DRY SITUATION SO AS TO EXCLUDE THE ORDINARY RAINS FROM THEIR NESTS OR CELLS APPRO PRIATED FOR THE RECEPTION OF THEIR EGGS OR YOUNG BROOD IS ABSO LUTELY NECESSARY BUT THAT THESE SITUATIONS HOWEVER WELL CALCU LATED FOR THE USUAL WEATHER COULD NOT AFFORD THIS PROTECTION FROM RAIN DURING THE HURRICANE MAY BE EASILY CONCEIVED WHEN BY THE VIOLENCE OF THE TEMPEST HEAVY PIECES OF ARTIL LERY WERE REMOVED FROM THEIR PLACES AND HOUSES AND SUGAR WORKS LEVELLED WITH THE GROUND THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT TREES AND EVERY THING GROWING ABOVE GROUND MUST HAVE GREATLY SUFFERED THIS WAS THE CASE GREAT NUMBERS OF TREES AND PLANTS WHICH RESIST COMMONLY THE ORDINARY WINDS WERE TORN OUT BY THE ROOT THE CANES WERE UNIVERSALLY EITHER LODGED OR VOL LXXX A A A TWISTED354 MR CASTLESS OBSERVATIONS ON TWISTED ABOUT AS IF BY A WHIRLWIND OR TORN OUT OF THE GROUND ALTOGETHER IN THE LATTER CASE THE BREEDING ANTS WITH THEIR PROGENY MUST HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO INEVITABLE DESTRUCTION FROM THE DELUGE OF RAIN WHICH FELL AT THE SAME TIME THE NUMBER OF CANES HOWEVER THUS TORN OUT OF THE GROUND COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ADEQUATE TO THE SUDDEN DIMINUTION OF THE SUGAR ANTS BUT IT IS EASY TO CONCEIVE THAT THE ROOTS OF CANES WHICH REMAINED ON THE GROUND AND THE EARTH ABOUT THEM WERE SO AGITATED AND SHAKEN AND AT THE SAME TIME THE ANTS NESTS WERE SO BROKEN OPEN OR INJURED BY THE VIOLENCE OF THE WIND AS TO ADMIT THE TORRENTS OF RAIN ACCOMPANYING IT I APPREHEND THEREFORE THAT THE PRINCIPAL DESTRUCTION OF THESE ANTS MUST HAVE BEEN THUS EFFECTED TWO CIRCUMSTANCES TENDED TO FACILITATE THIS HAPPY EFFECT MANY OF THE ROOTS OF THE CANES INFECTED AS ABOVE OBSERVED WERE EITHER DEAD OR ROTTEN SO AS NOT TO BE CAPABLE OF MAKING THE SAME RESISTANCE TO THE WIND AS THOSE IN PERFECT HEALTH AND THIS HURRICANE HAPPENED SO VERY LATE AS THE MONTH OF OCTOBER WHEN THE CANES ARE ALWAYS SO HIGH ABOVE GROUND AS TO GIVE THE WIND SUFFICIENT HOLD OF THEM WHICH AT AN EARLIER PERIOD WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THE CASE THAT MANY OF THE CANE ANTS WERE SWEPT OFF BY THE TORRENTS OF RAIN INTO THE RIVERS AND RAVINES AND THUS PERISHED I HAVE NO DOUBT BUT IF WE CONSIDER THE OBSTACLES TO THIS BEING VERY GENERAL IT COULD HAVE HAD BUT SMALL EFFECT IN CONSIDERABLY RE DUCING THEIR NUMBERS FOR ON FLAT LAND IT COULD NOT HAVE HAP PENED IN HANGING OR HILLY LAND THE CANE TRASH WOULD AFFORD GREAT SHELTER AND THE ANTS WOULD NATURALLY RETIRE TO THEIR NESTS FOR SECURITY WHEN THEY FOUND THEIR DANGER SOME HAVE SUPPOSED THAT THE SUGAR ANTS AFTER A CERTAIN TIME DEGENERATE AND BECOME INOFFENSIVE AND IN PROOF OF THIS THEYTHE SUGAR ANTS 355 THEY SAY MARTINIQUE AND BARBADOES WERE FREED FROM THEIR BAD EFFECTS WITHOUT A HURRICANE OR ANY OTHER APPARENT CAUSE THE IDEA OF ANY SUCH EXTRAORDINARY AND UNHEARDOF DEVIA TION OF NATURE IS TOO CONTEMPTIBLE TO DESERVE AN ANSWER BUT THE REASON IS OBVIOUS THE PLANTERS THERE EITHER ABANDONED THEIR CANE LANDS OR PLANTED THEM IN COFFEE COCAO COTTON IN DIGO C NONE OF WHICH ACCORDING TO THE ABOVE OBSERVATIONS AFFORD THE ANTS PROPER CONVENIENCY FOR THE PROPAGATION OF THEIR SPECIES AND THEREFORE THEIR NUMBERS MUST HAVE SO MUCH DECREASED AS TO READMIT THE CULTURE OF THE SUGARCANE AS BEFORE AT THE SAME TIME IT IS VERY PROBABLE THAT THIS DIMINUTION MIGHT HAVE IN PART BEEN OWING TO SOMETHING OF THE HURRICANE KIND FOR IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT STRONG SQUALLS OF WIND ATTENDED WITH HEAVY RAINS ARE FREQUENT IN THE WEST INDIES ALTHOUGH THEY DO NOT LAST SO LONG NOR ARE SO VIOLENT AS TO DESERVE THE NAME OF A HURRICANE IT MUST NOT HOWEVER BE DENIED THAT THOUGH NATURE FOR A TIME MAY PERMIT A PARTICULAR SPECIES OF ANIMAL TO BECOME SO UNPROPORTIONABLY NUMEROUS AS TO ENDANGER SOME OTHER PARTS OF HER WORKS SHE HERSELF WILL IN DUE TIME PUT A CHECK UPON THE TOO GREAT INCREASE AND THAT IS OFTEN DONE BY AN INCREASE OF SOME OTHER ANIMAL INIMICAL TO THE FORMER DESTROYERS IN THE PRESENT CASE HOWEVER NOTHING OF THAT SORT APPEARED THERE FORE WHEN A PLAIN NATURAL CAUSE OBVIOUS TO OUR SENSES OCCURRED BY WHICH WE CAN ACCOUNT FOR THE AMAZING AND SUDDEN DECREASE OF THOSE RUINOUS INSECTS IT IS UNNECESSARY TO RECUR TO OTHER POSSIBLE CAUSES TOO MINUTE FOR OUR INVESTIGATION ALL I HAVE SAID ON THIS SUBJECT WOULD CERTAINLY BE OF LITTLE OR NO CONSEQUENCE DID IT NOT LEAD TO THE TRUE METHOD OF CULTI VATING THE SUGARCANE ON LANDS INFESTED WITH THOSE DESTRUCTIVE A A A 2 INSECTS356 MR CASTLESS OBSERVATIONS ON INSECTS IN WHICH POINT OF VIEW HOWEVER IT BECOMES IMPORTANT IF THEN THE ABOVE DOCTRINE BE JUST IT FOLLOWS THAT THE WHOLE OF OUR ATTENTION MUST BE TURNED TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THE NESTS OF THESE ANTS AND CONSEQUENTLY THE BREEDING ANTS WITH THEIR EGGS OR YOUNG BROOD IN ORDER TO EFFECT THIS ALL TREES  AND FENCES UNDER THE ROOTS OF WHICH THESE ANTS COMMONLY TAKE THEIR RESIDENCE SHOULD FIRST BE GRUBBED OUT PARTICULARLY LIME FENCES WHICH ARE VERY COM MON IN GRENADA AND WHICH GENERALLY SUFFERED FROM THE ANTS BEFORE THE CANES APPEARED IN THE LEAST INJURED AFTER WHICH THE CANES SHOULD BE STUMPED OUT WITH CARE AND THE STOOLS BURNT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TOGETHER WITH THE FIELD TRASH OR THE DRIED LEAVES AND TOPS OF THE CANES IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE ANTS FROM MAKING THEIR ESCAPE TO NEW QUARTERS THE BEST WAY OF DOING THIS I APPREHEND WILL BE TO GATHER THE FIELD TRASH TOGETHER IN CONSIDERABLE HEAPS AND TO THROW THE STOOLS AS SOON AS DUG OUT OF THE GROUND INTO THEM AND IMMEDIATELY APPLY FIRE BY THIS MEANS MULTITUDES MUST BE DESTROYED FOR THE FIELD TRASH WHEN DRY BURNS WITH GREAT RAPIDITY THE LAND SHOULD THEN BE PLOUGHED OR HOEPLOUGHED TWICE BUT AT LEAST ONCE IN THE WETTEST SEASON OF THE YEAR IN ORDER TO ADMIT THE RAINS BEFORE IT IS HOED FOR PLANTING THE CANE BY THESE MEANS THESE INSECTS I APPREHEND WILL BE SO MUCH REDUCED IN NUM BER AS AT LEAST TO SECURE A GOOD PLANT CANE BUT IT IS THE CUSTOM IN MOST OF THE WEST INDIA ISLANDS TO PERMIT THE CANES TO RATTOON THAT IS AFTER THE CANES HAVE ONCE BEEN CUT DOWN FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING SUGAR THEY ARE  PARTICULAR FRUIT TREES MAY PROBABLY BE PRESERVED WITHOUT DETRIMENT BY CAREFULLY REMOVING THE EARTH FROM ABOUT THEIR ROOTS DESTROYING THE ANTS NESTS AND AFTERWARDS REPLACING EITHER THE SAME OR NEW EARTH SUFFEREDTHE SUGAR ANTS 357 SUFFERED TO GROW UP AGAIN WITHOUT REPLANTING AND THIS GENE RALLY FOR THREE OR FOUR YEARS BUT SOMETIMES FOR TEN FIFTEEN OR TWENTY IN THIS MODE OF CULTURE THE STOOLS BECOME LARGER EVERY YEAR SO AS TO GROW OUT OF THE GROUND TO A CONSIDERABLE HEIGHT AND BY THAT MEANS AFFORD MORE AND MORE SHELTER TO THE ANTS NESTS THEREFORE FOR TWO OR THREE SUCCESSIVE CROPS THE CANES SHOULD BE REPLANTED YEARLY SO AS NOT ONLY TO AFFORD AS LITTLE COVER AS POSSIBLE FOR THE ANTS NESTS BUT CONTINUALLY TO DISTURB SUCH ANTS AS MAY HAVE ESCAPED IN THE BUSINESS OF PRO PAGATING THEIR SPECIES THAT CONSIDERABLE EXPENCE AND LABOUR WILL ATTEND PUTTING THIS METHOD INTO EXECUTION THERE IS NO DOUBT AN EXPENSIVE CURE HOWEVER IS BETTER THAN NONE BUT FROM THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF AGRICULTURE I AM OF OPINION THAT THE PLANTER WILL BE AMPLY REPAID FOR HIS TROUBLE BY THE GOODNESS OF HIS CROPS IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE SUPERIOR TILTH THE LAND WILL RECEIVE IN THE PROPOSED METHOD OF THIS WE HAVE A PROOF IN THE ISLAND OF ST KITTS WHERE THEY CONSTANTLY REPLANT THEIR CANES YEARLY AND IT IS VERY WELL KNOWN THAT AN ACRE OF CANE LAND THERE GIVES A GREATER RETURN THAN THE SAME QUANTITY IN ANY OTHER ISLAND IN ST KITTS FIVE HOGSHEADS PER ACRE IS COMMON YIELD ING IN GOOD LAND IN GRENADA FROM TWO TO THREE HOGSHEADS FROM PLANT CANES AND HALF THAT QUANTITY FROM RATTOONS THUS ALTHOUGH THE ST KITTS PLANTER CUTS ONLY ONE HALF OF HIS CANE LAND YEARLY IN A GIVEN NUMBER OF YEARS HE MAKES A GREATER REVENUE THAN THE GRENADA PLANTER ON THE PRESENT MODE OF RATTOONING WHEN FOURFIFTHS OF THE CANE LAND IS YEARLY CUT SOME MAY BE OF OPINION THAT IT WOULD BE MORE ADVAN TAGEOUS TO CHANGE THE PRODUCE THAN TO PURSUE THE PROPOSED METHOD ON WHICH I SHALL ONLY OBSERVE THAT IT APPEARS TO ME THAT ONE HALF OF THE USUAL CROP OF SUGAR THUS PRODUCED WILL358 MR CASTLESS OBSERVATIONS C WILL BE MORE ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE PLANTER WHEN AT THE SAME TIME PROGRESS IS MAKING IN DESTROYING THE SUGAR ANTS THAN A FULL CROP OF ANY OTHER PRODUCE IN SOME VERY FEW SITUATIONS COT TON PERHAPS MAY BE EXCEPTED AS TO COFFEE IT IS TO BE CONSI DERED THAT IT GIVES NO RETURN TILL THE THIRD YEAR AFTER PLANTING AND NOT A FULL CROP TILL THE FIFTH COCAO BEGINS TO BEAR IN FIVE YEARS BUT YIELDS LITTLE TILL THE SEVENTH AND INDIGO NOT ONLY EXCEEDINGLY IMPOVERISHES THE LAND BUT IS UNHEALTHY TO THE NEGROES ADD TO THIS THAT FAR THE GREATEST PART OF SUGAR LANDS ARE UNFIT FOR THE CULTURE OF ANY OF THESE IT WOULD CARRY THIS LETTER TO TOO GREAT A LENGTH WERE I TO ADDUCE ALL THAT MAY BE SAID ON THIS SUBJECT I SHALL THEREFORE CONCLUDE BY OBSERVING THAT THE BEST PROOF OF THE TRUTH OF THE ABOVE DOCTRINE WILL BE THE SUCCESS ATTENDING THE PROPOSED ME THOD OF CULTIVATION OR ONE OF THE SAME TENDENCY VIZ TO ATTEMPT THE DESTRUCTION OF THE NESTS OF THESE INSECTS AND CON SEQUENTLY THE BREEDING ANTS WITH THEIR YOUNG BROODS FOR THEIR FECUNDITY APPEARS TO BE SO PRODIGIOUSLY GREAT AS TO RENDER IT ALTOGETHER IMPOSSIBLE TO DESTROY THEM BY POISON WHICH CAN NEVER BE GENERALLY ENOUGH USED TO EFFECT THAT PURPOSE

j100335,The Quarterly Journal of Economics,1883112,Legislation for Labor Arbitration,i332337,LEGISLATION FOR LABOR ARBITRATION On account of the increased number of lockouts and strikes during the past year the legislatures of several of the States holding sessions for 188586 felt it their duty to make some provision for boards or tribunals of arbitration created or sanc tioned by the State Four StatesIowa and Kansas in theNOTES AND ME1MORANDA 87 West followed by two leading manufacturing States of the East Massachusetts and New Yorkhave passed acts to create or authorize such boards A comparison of these four acts will illustrate the workings of the boards In the first place how and of whom are these boards to be composed By the acts of the two Western States Kansas and Iowa they are designated as tribunals and are to consist of even numbers to be composed half of employers and half of employee These tribunals are to be licensed or author ized by the district court of a county or by the judge thereof upon petition in a prescribed form by certain interested parties In Kansas the parties by whom such a petition may be signed are two either by five or more employes or by two or more separate firms individuals or corporations within the county who are employers within the county and the board or tribunal is to consist of four men to be named in the license In Iowa the petition must be signed by at least twentyfive employes and by four or more separate firms individuals or corporations within the county or by at least four employers each of whom shall employ at least five workmen or by the representative of a firm corporation or individual employing not less than twenty men in their trade or industry and the tribunal shall consist of not less than two employers or their representatives and two work men or their representatives each of the two classes always to have half of the full number and they shall be named by the parties in their petition for a license for the tribunal Finally in both States the courts have power upon motion to refuse the license if the representative character of the petitioners is found to be otherwise than as stated In New York the method of creation of the ordinary arbitration boards authorized under the act is much the same as in these Western acts The board is first created by the appointment of two members by each of the contending parties and the selection of a fifth member by the first four They are then licensed by the county judge and having given their consent to act are ready for business In Massachusetts the act provides for a single State Board of three members to be appointed yearly by the governor One member must be88 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS an employer or of some association representing employers of labor one must be a member of some labor organization and not an employer and the third shall be appointed upon the recommendation of the other two but if they fail to agree on the third man within thirty days the governor shall appoint him The act also makes it lawful for parties to a controversy who might apply to the State Board to agree upon a board of arbitration of their own choosing which board shall have and exercise all the powers of the State Board and have exclusive jurisdiction in the matters referred to it In three then out of the four acts the ordinary boards are given their authority by the county courts and are of a local character In the fourth that of Massachusetts where the board is created directly by the governor the board has jurisdiction over the whole State With the exception of the New York boards the term of a boards existence is one year In New York the authority of a board ceases as soon as it has rendered a decision in the original submission unless there have arisen and are in existence other grievances or disputes of a nature similar to the one for which the board was created in which case the parties to such other disputes may submit them to the board and the board shall have power as if originally created for such other disputes In the matter of compensation the Massachusetts act is the most liberal allowing 500 a day for each day of actual service in addition to all necessary expenses Kansas allows 200 a day for each day of actual service The Iowa act orders that the expenses of arbitration shall be met by volun tary subscription and the New York act makes no mention of any compensation whatever for its county boards In all of the acts submission of disputes or grievances to a board of arbitration is voluntary but the method varies as well as the cases which may be the subject of such arbitration In Massachusetts submission can only be made in case the question may not be the subject of a civil suit or a bill in equity and then only in case it is a dispute between employes and an employer whether an individual copartnership or cor poration who has at least twentyfive employes in the sameNOTES AND MEMORANDA 89 general line of work The application for action by the State Board must be signed by the employer or by a majority of his employes in the same general line of work or their agent or by both parties and must contain a promise to con tinue in the business or at work without lockout or strike until the decision if made within three weeks In New York submission may be made whenever any dispute arises between any firm jointstock association company or corporation and its employes Apparently there must always be joint action because the first four members of the board to arbitrate must be appointed by the respective parties before application is made to the court for a license The board presents its own petition to be established In Kansas and Iowa both parties must take action in the submission and the tribunals are to act in settlement of disputes in the mining mechanical or manufacturing industries Submission is voluntary then in all four States and in three this voluntary submission as described is the moving force for the very creation of the tribunals or boards of arbitration In Kansas and Iowa disputes arising in adjoining counties as well as those in the county of origin may be submitted to a tribunal of arbitration once created at any time during the year of its duration The tribunal sits at the county seat In New York although similar disputes  may be submitted to the ordinary boards when created it is intended that they shall be local in their action The Massachusetts board which has jurisdiction in any part of the State may travel from the scene of one dispute to another holding its hearings in the towns where the disputes arise New York is the only State which provides for an appeal from the decision of the board first hearing the case For that purpose a salaried State Board of arbitration of three members to be appointed annually by the governor one from each of the two principal political parties and the third from a bona fide labor organization was created It is the business of this board simply to hear appeals from the local boards These appeals must be made within ten days after the filing of the decision by the local board The decisions of this State Board are to be final upon both parties In90 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS Massachusetts the decisions of the State Board are final upon the parties who join in the application for six months or until either party has given the other notice in writing of an intention not to be bound at the end of sixty days therefrom In Kansas and Iowa where the tribunals are composed of equal members half being taken from each party the possi bility and likelihood of a futile termination of the arbitration by deadlocks in the tribunal have been guarded against by systems of umpires slightly different By the Kansas act the umpire is appointed by the court at the same time that it grants the license or authority to the tribunal and this umpire shall be called upon to act only upon a disagreement by the tribunal at three consecutive meetings Submission to him must be made in writing and signed by a majority of the tribunal or by the contending parties and must contain con sent that his decision shall be final This decision he must make within five days from the time of submission to him In Iowa the umpire is selected by the unanimous vote of the tribunal The other portions of the Iowa act relating to the umpire are essentially the same as in the Kansas act except that he has ten days within which to make his decision It is a natural question how the awards of these boards are to be enforced or of what force they are in themselves The New York law simply provides that the awards of the local courts  shall be a settlement of the matter referred and that the decision of the State Board for appeals shall be final and conclusive upon both parties to the arbitration The Massa chusetts act provides that the board shall advise the respec tive parties what ought to be done to adjust the dispute and make a written decision a decision binding for six months upon the parties who joined in the application or until either party has given the sixty days notice spoken of above In Iowa and Kansas the award is simply  final and conclusive on the parties in the ordinary cases of dispute but when award is made and recorded of a specific sum of money the proper court may on motion enter judgment thereon Finally the legislatures in attempting to remedy the evils of constant disputes between employers and emnployes seem to have taken but little notice of the numerous labor organizaCORRESPONDENCE 91 tions In the two Western acts no mention whatever is made of labor organizations and the difficulty is treated as if simply one between master and men In Massachusetts the only recognition of organized labor is in the provision that one of the three members of the State Board shall be selected from some labor organization In New York however the organizations of laborers receive more distinct recognition In making up the local boards two members are to come from the employes The act reads When the employs concerned are members in good standing of any labor organization which is represented by one or more delegates in a central body the said body shall have power to designate two of said arbitrators    In case the employs concerned in any grievance or dispute are members in good standing of a labor organization which is not represented in a central body then the organization of which they are members shall have the power to select and designate two arbitrators for said board And of the three members of the State Board one is to be a member of  a bonafide labor organization But even in New York the disputes are spoken of not as disputes between labor unions and employers but simply as disputes between  any employer and his employes H M WILLIAMS

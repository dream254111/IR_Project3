contention of counsel that the act of bankruptcy was committed by failure of respondent to extinguish the lien five days before the expiration of the four months was undoubtedly predicated upon the decisions In Re Tupper I63 Fed 766 Folger v Putnam 194 Fed 793 but the Supreme Court repudiates such doctrine unmistakably and in so doing accords with Seaboard Steel Casting Co v Trigg 124 Fed 75 In Re Vastbinder 126 Fed 417 In Re Vetterman I35 Fed 443 In Re Truitt 203 Fed 550 The question is a hard one on the one hand the Supreme Courts decision makes it possible for an insolvent debtor to prefer one of his creditors by allowing the entry of a judgment and letting it sleep for four monthsthe judgment lien then becomes immune from attack by the other creditors on the other hand the contention that four months inaction amounts to a final disposi tion of the property subject to the judgment lien is farfetched and as pointed out in the principal case has no basis in the statute however salutary its effect may be In the words of the opinion a final disposi tion used in connection with the statute unquestionably means an affirma tive act of disposal not a mere lapse of time which leaves the lien intact and still requiring enforcement Succinctly put it is an act having sub stantially the effect of a salethe transfer of ownership and control from one to another BANKRUPTCYSTOCKBROKERSRATABLE DISTRIBUTION oS STocKBank rupts who were stockbrokers having incurred liability to their customers for 280 shares of stock failed with but IOO shares of such stock in their possession Held that each customer was entitled as against the general creditors to such proportion of the stock in the possession of the brokers at the time of the bankruptcy as the shares which the brokers should have held to his account bore to the total amount of shares which should have been in their possession In Re H B Hollins  Co I914 212 Fed 317 The decision in the principal case is in accord with the previously an nounced doctrine that where a stockbroker has in his possession at the time of his bankruptcy certificates of stock placed in his hands by a cus tomer but not yet sold or stock bought for a customer but not yet delivered to him he holds the same as an agent or bailee and the stock may be reclaimed from his trustee in bankruptcy In re James Corothers  Co 182 Fed 50i And it is immaterial that the certificates found in bankrupts possession are not identical with those bailed or appropriated to the cus tomer as his property by the purchasing broker since certificates of stock are but indicia of the property in the shares and not the stock itself and as one share of stock is not different in kind or quantity from every other share of the same issue and company the owners of such in the bankrupts posses sionas in the case of grain in elevators which has been indiscriminately mixed and has lost its separate identification therebyare tenants in com mon of the sum total or mass Richardson v Shazu 209 U S 365 In Gorman v Littlefield 229 U S 19 recovery of 250 shares out of 350 44RECENT IMPORTANT DECISIONS like shares passing into trustee in bankruptcys hands was allowedthe trustee and the claimant being treated as tenants in common of the whole The decision reversed the lower court which denied recovery because the stock certificates could not be identified as claimants property The dis tinction between the latter and the principal case is purely mathematical In Gorman v Littlefield the number of shares passing to the trustee exceeded the number subject to demand by the customers in the principal case the sum total of shares passing to the trustee is less than the number subject to demand The court seems to have applied the rule with equal precision in both cases BANKS AND BANKINGNEGLIGENCE BY DEPOSITOR AFTER DISCOVERING FOR GERY OF CHECKPlaintiff depositor drew a check on defendant bank which honored it when presented for payment It developed that the payees in dorsement was forged After the check had been cashed plaintiff discovered the forgery but did not inform the bank until 43 days after obtaining the information Held plaintiff nonsuited because of such negligence Con nors v Old Forge Discount Bank Pa 1914 9I Atl 210 The accepted rule is that payment by a bank upon a forged indorsement of a check payable to order is not binding upon the drawer Welsh v German Am Bank 73 N Y 424 But Iwhen a depositor discovers that a bank has paid and charged to his account either a check bearing his forged signature as drawer or his check on the forged indorsement of the payee it is his duty to notify the bank promptly of the forgery If he fails to notify promptly Ihe cannot recover from the bank irrespective of whether the latter could have protected itself or not McNeely v Bank 221 Pa 588 70 Atl 89I In the latter case no notice was given for nearly three months It was decided on the theory that by such negligence the depositor withheld from the bank a substantial right of proceeding promptly against the forger The decision is important in holding that thebankneed not give evidence showing it could have protected itself if notified To same effect Leather Mnfs Bank v Morgan 117 U S 96 6 Sup Ct 657 Voorhis v Olmstead 66 N Y II3 II8 Fall River Bank v Buffinton 97 Mass 498 In United States v Nat Exch Bank 45 Fed 163 the court went even further and held that neglect of the drawer for over one month after discovering the check had been paid on a forged indorse ment to notify bank that it would be held responsible released the bank from liability even though it had notice of the forgery as soon as the drawer had The instant case must be distinguished from cases in which the depositor is negligent in discovering the forgery as by not looking at returned checks for instance and from cases in which the depositor has notified the bank of the forgery but has not tendered back the check for a considerable time Cook v U S 91 U S 402 Ellis v Trust Co 4 Ohio St 662 Schroeder v Harvey 75 I11 639 Brixen v Nat Bank 5 Utah 504 I8 Pac 43 This distinction explains in part the doctrine of a few cases holding that the bank must show actual damage resulting to it because of no noti fication A few other cases are flatly contrary to the instant case on this 45

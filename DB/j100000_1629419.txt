Lansing Kansas and about twenty miles northwest of Kansas City a human skeleton was found last spring by farmers in digging a long tunnel excava tion for use as a dairy cellar Soon after the discovery the place was visited by M C Long and Edwin Butts of Kansas City the former being curator of the public museum there for which they obtained the skeleton Mr Butts a civil engineer made measurements of the excavation which extends 72 feet into the bluff Its floor is a nearly level stratum of Carboniferous limestone and its lower part consists of debris of limestone and earth while its upper part is the fine calcareous silt called loess The skeleton was found mostly in a disjointed and partly broken and decayed condition at the distance of 68 to 70 feet from the entrance of the tunnel about two feet above its floor and 20 feet below the surface of the ground exactly above it Half of the lower jaw was found ten feet nearer the en trance and a foot lower than the principal parts of the skeleton including the other half of the lower jaw About a month ago this locality was care fully examined again by Mr Long and Pro fessor S W Williston of the Kansas State University and the latter wrote a short article A Fossil Man in Kansas which was pub lished in SCIENCE August 1 Before this article appeared newspaper accounts had been seen by Professor N H Winchell of Minne apolis and by myself in St Paul which had led us to plan a journey to Kansas partly for the purpose of examining the Lansing skele ton and the drift section in which it was dis covered We accordingly visited this tunnel excavation at the house of Martin Concan non on Saturday August 9 Professors S W Williston and Erasmus Haworth of the State University Lawrence Kansas and M 0 Long Sidney J Hare and P A Sutermeister of Kansas City accompanied us Mr Con cannon owner of the farm and his sons who dug the tunnel and found the skeleton were 355 also present and explained again all the cir cumstances of their discovery The entire section of the tunnel which is about 10 feet wide 7 feet high with arched top and 72 feet long was examined addi tional bones as of the hands and feet were found in the dump outside and the skele ton in Kansas City was inspected Accord ing to Professor Willistons measurements of the bones the fossil man was about five feet eight inches in stature and was probably more than fifty years of age as estimated from the worn condition of the teeth The skull is dolichocephalic with receding fore head strongly developed supraciliary ridges and a markedly prognathous face and chin Most of the vertebrse and ribs are wanting probably because of their decay previous to the deep inhumation by the overlying loess The skeleton lay in the upper part of the earthy debris including many limestone frag ments of small size and some as large as two or three feet in length Just above it at an ir regular line a few inches to a foot higher a horizontally stratified water deposit of fine loess begins forms the upper two thirds of the tunnel and extends up to the surface 20 feet above the place of the skeleton The loess continues up to Mr Concannons house which is about 100 feet distant on a slight terrace about 35 feet above the horizon of the skele ton and 47 feet above the level reached by the adjoining Missouri river at its highest flood since Mr Concannons settlement here 35 years ago This flood in 1881 was 25 feet above the lowest stage of the river which is 735 feet above the sea The Carboniferous limestone outcrops about 50 feet southeast of the house and rises gradually in a spur ridge southeastward to a height of 150 feet or more above the river Within a quarter of a mile southward and also within a half mile to the west and north west the loess forms uplands about 200 feet above the Missouri and at the end of the loess deposition it doubtless stretched as a broad floodplain 200 or 250 feet above the present river level across the Missouri valley which has been subsequently reexcavated The skeleton appeared to all our party to have AUGUST 29 1902356 SCIENCE been entombed at the beginning of the loess deposition which would refer it to the Iowan stage of the Glacial period long after the ice sheet had receded from Missouri and Kan sas but while it still enveloped northern Iowa and nearly all of Wisconsin and Minnesota In other words it belonged to a time before the prominent moraines of these lastnamed states were formed on the borders of the wan ing icesheet The very old Kansas glacial drift including many boulders of the red Sioux quartzite is very thinly spread on this northeastern part of Kansas under the loess and reaches about 30 miles south of Lansing terminating along an east to west boundary 12 to 15 miles south of the Kansas or Kaw River The loess and the Lansing skeleton are of Late Glacial age but are probably twice or perhaps three times as ancient as the traces of man in his stone implements and quartz chips occurring in glacial gravel and sand beds at Trenton N J and Little Falls Minn In the Somme Valley and other parts of France as also in southern England stone implements in river drift prove that man existed there before the Ice age that is probably 100000 years ago or doubtless four or five times longer ago than the date of the skeleton at Lansing Kansas WARREN UPHAM NOTES ON INORGANIC CHEMISTRY IT appears from a recent paper in the Berichte that Dr Marckwald has at last suc ceeded in preparing a specimen of polonium the radioactive element associated with bis muth in such a way that the question of its being a peculiar form of bismuth itself may be set aside The method used was to take a specimen of strongly radioactive oxychlorid of bismuth dissolve it in acid and then pre cipitate the metal by a rod of pure metallic bis muth Under these circumstances the bis muth becomes coated with a black deposit which seems to be nearly pure polonium inas much as the radioactivity of the solution is wholly concentrated in the black deposit which is itself extremely active The amount obtained from several kilos of pitchblende resi N S VOL XVI No 400 dues was only a few milligramls from which it was estimated that the amount of polonium in pitchblende is not over one gram per ton Dr Marckwald hopes however to obtain enough of the pure metal by this method to determine its atomic weight K A Hofmann has also continued his work on radioactive substances from the uranium minerals especially upon radioactive lead The radium so obtained is very much more ac tive upon the photographic plate than is polo nium A specimen of radioactive lead sulfid which acted powerfully upon a photographic plate was much weaker in discharging the electroscope than a specimen of polonium oxychlorid which had no effect whatever through a thin gutta percha film upon a photo graphic plate even after twenty hours expo sure He found that radioactive lead prepa rations gain in activity by preservation in a dry condition in closed tubes A number of metals seem capable of robbing uranium of its activity In one experiment a solution of pure uranium was mixed with barium and the latter precipitated by sulfuric acid The ura nium thereby lost completely its activity both toward the electroscope and toward the photo graphic plate after standing two days in a closed tube the uranium regained its activity The same phenomenon was observed in another experiment when bismuth was substituted for barium A number of the rare earths such as thorium erbium didymium cerium and lan thanum are capable of receiving an induced activity from uranium and the same is true not only of barium but also of strontium and calcium Activity is very slightly induced in yttrium and not at all in glucinum and zirconium Lead receives a weak activity when precipitated from the uranium solution with sulfuric acid but none at all when the precipitant is caustic potash The same number of the Berichte contains a paper by Stock and Doht continuing their investigations of stibin SbH This hydrid of antimony was obtained in the solid state some years ago by Olszewski but great diffi culty had been experienced by him and by them in obtaining more than a very small trace of the gas from the materials used The

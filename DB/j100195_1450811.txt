IV1 THE FRANKFORT SOCIETY OF THE FRIENDS OF REFORM 2 THE Jewish community of FrankfortontheMain had been for centuries one of the foremost in Germany it was distinguished for the learned men who had filled the rab binical position there for the stirring scenes that had been enacted in its famed  Gasse 3 and for the prominence and wealth of a number of its families While the city was an imperial fief its Jewish community had been ruled by special legislation Judenordnungen which the Emperors issued from time to time when the sway of the Emperors came to an end in I806 Frankfort passed under the rule of the Prince Primate of the Rhenish Confederation Karl von Dahlberg This ruler published a new order for the govern ment and protection of the Jews which was not much of an improvement on the old Judenordnungen for it with held from them expressly the right of citizenship When the Duchy of Frankfort with its own constitution was formed upon the dissolution of the Rhenish Confederation the representatives of the Jews induced the Archduke 1 In connexion with the reference to the Jewish Religious Union of London towards the close of my article in the April 1904 number of the Quarterly mention should have been made of the Hampstead Sabbath Afternoon Services begun on Feb 22 I890 and conducted by the Rev Morris Joseph with the assistance of a number of other gentlemen These services continued for three years and were of a reform tendency 2 Frankfurter Verein der Reformfreunde 3 See the authors Old European Jewries 4681 Philadelphia I894 X 2308 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Dahlberg to promulgate a special law in consideration of a great sum of money this law declared that the Jews of Frankfort with their children and descendants should enjoy civil rights and privileges equally with other citizens The Jews took the oath of citizenship and it seemed indeed as though the long night of mediaevalism had passed away and the morn of freedom had dawned But it was a deceptive hope After the fall of Napoleon a reactionary period set in the evil effects of which were felt for the time being by the Jews throughout Germany The Congress of Vienna which was convened in 1814 for the purpose of regulating the affairs of the European states after the fall of Napoleon and which was participated in by the great statesmen of the allied countries gave some consideration also to the Jewish question the fourteenth Article of the first draft of the Acts of the Congress as agreed upon by the representatives of Austria Prussia and Hanover had declared that Jews who performed all the duties of citizens should be accorded all the rights of citizenship and that wherever the existing laws of a State presented obstacles to the consummation of this pro gramme those obstacles should be removed as soon as pos sible A number of the representatives of the smaller German states protested against this paragraph but the two great Powers Austria and Prussia insisted upon its retention The free cities among them Frankfort which had obtained its autonomy in the meantime objected particularly to the term rights of citizenship Biirgerrechte and demanded the substitution of the phrase  civil rights BiJrgerliche Rechte This alteration was made and in its final form the Article included the further provision that until such a change became an accomplished fact the Jews of the separate states should continue to be governed by the special legislation in force at the time This action of the Congress gave ground for the hope that the spirit of mediaevalism that still obtained in the conduct of the affairs of the Jews would soon disappear A violent antiTHE REFORM MOVEMENT IN JUDAISM 309 Jewish literary campaign ensued however in various cities of Germany which culminated in the turbulent and disgraceful hephep outbreaks of the year I819 in Frank fort and elsewhere 1 A bitter struggle waged between the Senate of Frankfort and the Jews for eight years from j8i6 to I824 in which latter year the Jews succeeded in obtaining certain rights The movement for Jewish civil emancipation went bravely forward until it was crowned with success in the revolutionary year I848 in most of the German states although it was not until 1864 that the last vestige of civil discrimination against the Jews of Frank fort disappeared But the agitation for change was not confined to the political and civil disabilities under which the Jews rested the dissatisfaction with the status quo had invaded the religious province also In former essays I traced the earliest efforts towards religious reform in Berlin Ham burg Breslau and London in which cities sharp contests had been waged between the traditionalists and the re formers A similar encounter took place in the community of FrankfortontheMain which was differentiated from the incidents previously described in that other aspects of the struggle were brought prominently to the fore In Frankfort possibly more than anywhere else the intimate connexion between the newer educational move ment among the Jews and religious reform is apparent Frankfort was noted among tile Jewish communities of Germany for its excellent school the Philanthropin where modern methods of education had superseded the Cheder altogether The children who attended this school received instruction in all branches of knowledge commonly taught in secular educational institutes instruction in Jewish subjects only as was the case in the Cheder had given way to a more extended curriculum life necessarily had a larger outlook for the pupil who attended such a school than it 1 Graetz History of the Jews English translation V 529 Philadelphia 18953I0 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW had for the child whose education was restricted to Jewish subjects The spirit of the new time ruled in the one place while the spirit of the ghetto still brooded over the other It is in the Philanthropin that the first faint traces of the reform agitation in Frankfort are discernible Devotional exercises for the pupils were introduced in the year I813 religious instruction had been imparted regularly since the organization of the school in 1804 but the need for a service that should edify the pupils was felt more and more strongly In the synagogue of the general com munity as a matter of course there was no sign of change the rabbi Solomon Abraham Trier was one of the most uncompromising opponents to any innovation whatsoever as shall appear later on the rising generation was repelled rather than attracted by the public worship the service instituted on Sabbath and holidays in the Philanthropir was of a character to stimulate devotion and intensify the religious spirit of the young people within its walls it was conducted partly in the vernacular and an address was delivered in German weekly either by the head master Dr M Hess or the teacher J Johlson 1 Thus the German sermon was introduced into this com munity without any struggle whereas had the attempt been made at this early day to have such sermons delivered in the communal synagogue it would have entailed a bitter struggle with the adherents of the old order as had been the case in Berlin2 As the children who attended this school grew into manhood and womanhood they leaned naturally towards reform nay more the services conducted in the school began to attract adults in the course of time In i825 Dr Michael Creizenach was called from Mayence to teach in the school Creizenach was a man of great I Wissenschaftliche Zeitschrift fur judische Theologie II 148 For a full account of these services see the recent publication Festschrift zur Jahr hunderffeier der Realschite der israelitischen Gemeinde Philanthropin zu Frank furt am Main 18041904 5054 Frankfurt am

desire to conciliate the orthodox partyl like so many writers of that time he aimed to prove the justification for reform in Judaism from the Talmud he hoped thus to bridge over the differences between the traditionalists and the reformers and to recon cile the former to the changes which were taking place in the interpretation of Judaism and which he felt were absolutely necessary But in this he could not succeed eloquently and learnedly as he defended his thesis in a number of his earlier writings2 For the thesis rested upon a fallacy3 True passages can be cited from the Talmud in support of the contention that authorities of former times sanctioned departures from established law and custom because of changed conditions4 but these were isolated instances the body of authority remained the same The new movement in Judaism however meant something altogether different the Jews were facing a state of affairs as subversive of their past as was the case when the temple of Jerusalem was destroyed and they exchanged their national existence for a world mission Circumstances had compelled the postponement of the active carrying out of this prophetic world mission for eighteen hundred years they were forced into isolation by the inhuman policy of both church and state and as a defence against their hostile onslaughts the fence of the law was built up and surrounded the religion in its every activity this was the religious counterpart to their political state now another crisis was at hand the ghetto isolation was apparently drawing to a close 1 Jost Geschichte

ceased The Talmudical legislation no longer fitted conditions and the spirit of the Talmudical legislation could not be invoked to summon forth the light which was to distinguish between chaos and order between past repression and prospective freedom The fortunes of Jewry were undergoing a revolution the Talmudical legislation in its details could not be accommodated to the changes superinduced by this revolution there must be a new adjustment of the standards even though this involved a new interpretation of the principles of tradition the purpose of God was as apparent in the present changes as it had been in any past events and since God had brought this to pass it was as truly a divine revelation as any recorded of former times1 hence it might be neces sary to disregard the form that the faith assumed under the Talmudical guise and clothe it in garments altogether different The Talmudical legislation could not be ex pected to meet so radical a change as the new time involved hence the failure of such as attempted to sail the craft of Judaism through the agitated waters of the sea that had been unknown to the Talmudical mariners by the compass and chart fashioned by them Creizenach himself recognized this 2 before his death which occurred in 1842 a short time before there took place the sharp and definite clash between the opposing parties in Judaism in the city of his adoption which crisis he possibly more than any single individual helped to precipitate See Holdheims remarkable statement in Freunds Zur Judenfrage in Deutschland II I65I66 which is quoted below also ibid p 335 2 In his later writings Creizenach abandoned this position which involved besides the attempt to justify the reform movement by Talmudi cal authority the effort to fit the Talmudical legislation to the needs of the new age as the Talmud by means of its peculiar hermeneutics had done with the Biblical injunctions He now advocated a return to pure Mosaism thus disregarding the Talmudical period of Jewish development altogether this was a serious misreading of tle import of the idea of tradition as shall be shown later onTHE REFORM MOVEMENT IN JUDAISM 3I3 His appointment as teacher in the Philanthropin proved to be of farreaching effect not only in the educational but also in the religious life of the scholars of the institution nay more his influence extended beyond the walls of the school into the community at large On the one hand he preached definitely and positively against the indifference of such as having ceased to be strict observers of traditional law form and custom had swung to the opposite extreme of aloofness from the religious life altogether and on the other hand he denounced the formalism into which rabbinical Judaism had degenerated and which being the recognized official expression of the faith was the primary cause of the alienation of those who looked to religion to be a living reality and not merely the observance of a mass of forms the most of which had ceased to have any significance whatsoever for that generation Creizenach gave utterance to these ideas not only in his publications but still more effectively in the sermons preached at the weekly services in the school Through these sermons the services attracted many adults and the number of participants grew to such an extent that a special chapel known as the Andachtbssaal was erected in I828 The confirmnation service for boys and girls was introduced Similar services were conducted in another educational establishment the Well Institute  The most noteworthy effect of these services and sermons in the vernacular was that they paved the way for reform However the traditionalists were not blind to what was going on they denounced the influence of the teachers of the Philanthropin as disintegrating and demoralizing and blamed the instruction in secular branches as being re sponsible for the breaking away from the traditions Hence they concluded that the situation could be saved only by the reestablishment of an oldtime school wherein Hebrew branches alone should be taught It became apparent before long that such a school was doomed to failure in order to ensure its success they determined 1 Wissenschaftliche Zetschriftfiur jidische Theologie II I49314 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW to introduce secular studies into the curriculum these to be secondary however to the Hebrew instruction Even with this concession the school did not flourish and had to be closed This failure did not discourage the advocates and upholders of the traditional system of Jewish educa tion They sought to establish a higher institute for the exclusive study of the Talmud and the allied disciplines A long and heated controversy on the Talmud and rab binism ensued voices were heard pro and con but the Talmudical party were championing in this instance as it appeared a hopeless cause They received no encourage ment at the hands of the Senate of the city in their plea for the establishment of this special Talmudical academy and the attempt was abandoned  The cause of reform was winning its way quietly not only through the educa tional work within the community but it was furthered also by the attitude of noninterference on the part of the lawmaking body of the city As has been already men tioned ever since the Jews had been permitted to dwell in Frankfort they had been governed by special legislative Acts After Frankfort had become a free city and notably after the passing of the sway of Napoleon and the meeting of the Congress of Vienna the Jews petitioned for the rights of citizenship The sixteenth Article of the pro ceedings of the Congress as adopted finally gave rise to prolonged discussions in the Senate which resulted in the passing of the law of Sept 1 1824 defining the restrictions and rights of the Jews This law declared that the Jews could regulate their own religious affairs and were exempt firom all interference of the state or the Christian community in their internal religious organization The agitations in the community growing out of the differences between progressivists and reactionaries in the fourth decade of the nineteenth century were converg ing gradually to the point of gaining a majority represen tation on the governing board of the community This 1 Jost Geschichte der Israeliten X part i IOITHE REFORM MOVEMENT IN JUDAISM 315 promised to be of farreaching importance because of the fact that the old age of the rabbi made the election of an associate imperative The progressive party naturally wished to secure the appointment of one of the new school of rabbis to the post the traditionalists were just as desirous of electing a rabbi of the old school to whom Talmud and Shulchan Arukh were oracle and authority This contingency together with other difficulties arising out of questions which touched the administration of all the affairs of the Congregation induced the Directory of the same to request the Senate to pass a general Act on the organization the duties and the mode of procedure of the governing board of the Israelitish community This petition aroused intense excitement and an address signed by 21 members of the community was presented to the Senate in which the request was preferred that all the religious and ecclesiastical affairs of the community should be taken out of the hands of the Directory who should thereafter concern themselves only with the political civil social and other nonreligious concerns of the community and that the religious affairs be made the care of a special committee as suggested in the address This called forth a counteraddress signed by 272 names denouncing the unwarranted procedure of the signers of the first address The result of all this agitation was the passing of an Act by the Senate on Feb I6 1839 for the regulation of the affairs of the Israelitish commulnity the communication of the Act to the Directory was accompanied by an extract from the proceedings of the Senate which contained these striking words The Senate will be ready always to oppose every and anything that may wound the conscien tious scruples of believing Israelites or may disturb or place obstacles in the way of their traditional worship but on the other hand it will encourage and support such insti tutions as the progressive needs of the age make necessary for the true and essential demands of religion Cognizance is taken here of the differing wings of religious thought in315 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Judaism The fourth paragraph of this Act of I839 is of particular interest and import in the story of Jewish reform notably in the light of later events This para graph was concerned with the question of the qualification of the future rabbis of the congregation it required that the candidates for the position  be German by birth that they must have graduated from a German gymnasium and have taken courses in Oriental languages in historical and philosophical branches in a German university This implied as a matter of course that the day of the rabbi trained and educated in the yeshibah only was past and served notice that the aspirants to the rabbinical position in this community must be men of modern education and modern training In so far the progressive party had gained a victory and the old rabbi who as was mentioned specifically in the Act was to remain undisturbed in his position could not but be troubled by the evident signs of the impending introduction of a new order of things in the religious guidance of the community These signs had been apparent for a number of years past in private circles within the Jewry of Frankfort to a much greater degree than appears from the official history of the community as embodied in Acts and regu lations Since the breaking up of mediaeval conditions there had been in Frankfort as in Berlin and other German cities a coterie of Jewish laymen who educated in the gymnasia and the universities were dissatisfied with traditional Judaism and formed a nucleus for the dis semination of ideas advocating the reform cause Indi vidually these men were at variance with the official representatives of Judaism they were out of sympathy with the existing conditions in the synagogue when Geiger established his Wiseenschaftliche Zeitschrift fiir jiidische Theologie they hailed this as the dawning of a 1 Israelit Annalen I 102 See also a correspondence between Senator Frederick Ihm the referee for Jewish affairs and the Directory of the Congregation ibid I324THE REFORM MOVEMENT IN JUDAISM 317 new day here was a platform for the discussion of the new wants and a forum for the scientific exposition of the principles and the literature of Judaism The gradual appearance on the scene of German Jewish life of a new school of rabbis men graduated from the universities a number of whom contributed to this magazine en couraged them in the hope that definite steps would be taken towards an official adjustment of Judaism to life but the rabbis proceeded too slowly for them with very few exceptions these rabbis considered it advisable to proceed very cautiously and to reconcile the old with the new rather than discard the old in the interest of the new in theory many of the rabbis quite agreed with the most pronounced opinions concerning the inadequacy and the unsuitedness of the Talmudical legislation to modern needs and the modern spirit but in practice they continued to conduct their office along the traditional lines they declared their sympathy with religious progress by enlisting under the banner of what they called progressive rabbinism der fortschreitende Rabbinismus the laymen just spoken of had no patience with this Fabian attitude they wanted an outspoken declaration expressive of the change that had come over Judaism they began to accuse the rabbis of cowardice and to take matters into their own hands they wrote slightingly and bitingly of the lack of courage dis played by the rabbis in not rising to the occasion and coined the phrase  creeping rabbinism  der fortklriechende Rabbinismus as a substitute for the rabbis own designa tion  progressive rabbinism A company of such laymen was much in evidence in Frankfort in the fourth and fifth decades of the nineteenth century they had formed a society significantly entitled The Society of the Dawn Die Lesegesellschaft zur aufge henden MorgenrSthe the members of which were described by one of their number in I841 as not subscribing to Talmudical ceremonialism which separates the Israelites from their fellow citizens after a rhetorical outburst in318 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW the following strain How long will the Talmuddevotees confound the pure religion of an Isaiah a Jeremiah a Micah with the ceremonial religion of the Pharisees   How long will they continue to oppose the progress of civilization and the civic life  The first of these questions shows how little men of this stamp understood the true inwardness of the reform movement in its attitude towards the Talmud and how superficial was their under standing of the true development of Judaism An anonymous article which appeared in Geigers Wissenschaftliche Zeitschrift in 837 2 and which was written supposedly by one of these Jewish laymen of Frankfort 3 describes their attitude so fully and so clearly that it may be considered almost in the light of a pre liminary notice of the formation of the Society of the Friends of Reform the subject of this essay The article is entitled  Jews and Judaism and has the subheading  Reflections of a Layman After setting forth the progress of the Jews in various branches of learning in the new era their strides in the struggle for civil emancipation and their growing participation in the life and endeavour of society he declares broadly that although the Jews have progressed Judaism has stood still There may be some he continues who have a correct understanding of what Judaism really is but as long as there is no clear un mistakable declaration of what is to be considered pure Judaism and what only temporary form so long will the religion continue in its present distortion as yet Judaism is supposed to include every jot of the traditional rabbinical interpretation the Shulchan Arukh with its insatiable commentaries and supercommentaries is still recognized as the authoritative code a deviation from which is con sidered equivalent to a deviation from the religion itself He declares that the prime need is a sifting of the mass of Israelit des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts II 1841 82 pp 16171 s Jost Gesch der Israeliten X part iii 2I2 note 3THE REFORM MOVEMENT IN JUDAISM 319 accretions that have attached themselves to Judaism and the separation of the pure metal from the dross the rabbis should do this he recognizes however that the rabbis ministering as they do to congregations composed of many elements are placed in a difficult position and in their longing to have the confidence of all are fearful of taking decisive steps forward even if they would Be this there fore as it may be the rabbis chargeable with neglect in a fearless expression of their religious convictions or no  it becomes the duty of us nontheologians if we have the welfare of Judaism truth and progress at heart to make solemn declaration of our views in order to remove from ourselves the reproachfirst of indifference and secondly of a contradiction between our thoughts and acts on the one hand and our religious profession on the other as well as to encourage by this sign of earnest participation such rabbis as are perhaps ready and anxious to take decisive steps forward He recognizes that nontheologians have neither the requisite knowledge nor authority but this declaration of theirs is to be only a general statement of their convictions and is to be rather in the nature of an address to the rabbis of Germany calling upon them to state whether the declaration is a truthful representa tion or no But of all things it was necessary to publish such a declaration all else was detail that could be worked out later this declaration should make known that the signers do not feel in conscience bound to invest the prescriptions of the Talmud to say nothing of those of the later rabbis in as far as these cannot be proven by scientific exegesis to have been derived directly from the Bible or to have been handed down by Moses with any greater authority than is accorded all other temporary religious institutions whose reasonableness and whose agree ment with the spirit of Judaism must first be established He concludes by saying that in whatever community a sufficient number of intelligent laymen may be found they must unite in a declaration of this kind The cleft320 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW between practice and profession must be removed  The differences in Judaism exist better that the sympa thizers range themselves together than that they act singlehandedly better that a clear understanding be arrived at than that compromises be resorted to better in short that the present state of affairs be made the startingpoint of true progress than that through wilful blindness it lead to complete disintegration Without doubt such were the sentiments that prevailed with a large number of Jews throughout Germany these sentiments crystallized into definite form in Frankfort where in November I842 a number of Jews formed them selves into a society which they called The Society of the Friends of Reform Verein der Reforimfreunde They were all laymen it was distinctly a lay movement the absence of all theologians from the membership of the society was so noticeable a feature that it could not but arouse comment especially as the purpose of the society was preeminently religious The charge was preferred against its promoters that the exclusion of theologians was intentional Dr M A Stern of Gottingen famed as a mathe matician and undoubtedly a man of exceptional intellectual powers wrote a series of open letters in answer to attacks upon the society I shall have occasion to refer to these letters frequently as they are the apologia for the society In one place he meets the charge of exclusion of rabbis from the society by claiming that there is no longer any priestly caste in Judaism there is no distinction between rabbis and laymen on the score of sacerdotalism the only recognized distinction in Judaism is between those who know and those who do not know the law Herein lies a great principle of religious freedom and the fact that the society is composed altogether of socalled laymen is equi valent to a rebuke to the assumptions of the occupants 1 Offene Briefe iiber den Reformverein Israelit des neunzehrten Jahrhunderts vol V I844 171I75 179183 187I91 I9720I 205209 285288 293 297 301304 VI I845 4I43 4953

refers to the article published some years before in Geigers theo logical magazine which urged the formation of societies of laymen for the very purpose for which the Frankfort society was founded2 Still despite this explanation which contains a great and salient truth there seems to be little doubt that the real reason for the exclusion of rabbis was a certain contempt which the intellectuals among the laity felt for the occupants of the rabbinical positions this trace of intellectual snobbishness is apparent even to this day The rabbis had not grappled with the religious problem as vigorously as these laymen thought they should have done they themselves would therefore take the matter in their own hands and lead the way3 Geiger the foremost figure in the Jewish theological world was a close friend of Sterns letters passed between them in one of which Geiger speaks of your contempt for the theologianswhich you deny it is true but which is only too apparent 4 This sharp differentiation was unfortunate inasmuch as it accentuated the very distinction that Stern claimed the society desired to eradicate and arrayed all the rabbis with one exception 5 against the movement The brief career of the Frankfort Reform Society was one of the most striking episodes of the drama of Jewish religious development that is being unfolded in these pages The men who formed the society were actuated by the conviction that there must be many Jews through out Germany who were ripe for a new expression of the principles of Judaism since the changed political and social status the acquisition of secular knowledge in short 1 op cit V 182 2 Supra s Professional theologians were excluded intentionally from the deliberations of the societyJost Gesch der Isr X part iii 2I3 4 Geiger

QUARTERLY REVIEW the complete break between their external fortunes and the conditions of the life of their ancestors must make them feel the impossibility of fitting the rabbinical interpretation of the religion to the modern Jewish environment It was also felt that if they would make a short sharp and definite declaration of what they considered the essential principles of the faith this would encourage all who entertained like sentiments to do the same and the concerted movement away from rabbinical Judaism many of whose enactments were disregarded by a multitude of contemporaneous Jews and towards a modern Judaism would be begun The members of the society met privately for deliberation and discussion They formulated five principles as their declaration of faith viz i that they consider the Mosaic religion capable of continuous development 2 that they do not consider binding the various ritual dietary and other laws concerned with bodily practices that emanated from the ancient polity 3 that they do not consider circumcision binding either as a religious act or a symbol 4 that they do not recognize the Talmud as authoritative and 5 that they do not expect or long for a Messiah who will lead the Jews back to Palestine but regard the country to which they belong either by birth or citizenship as their only fatherland This original declaration of principles was altered at a subsequent meeting when it was determined to omit paragraphs 2 and 3 and cast the other three paragraphs into another form this was done and the revised draft which will be cited presently was adopted and promulgated as the creed of the society The omission of the two paragraphs was due to the argument which was advanced successfully that such a declaration should be general in character and not touch special points about which there were still such decided differences of opinion even among many who might confidently be expected to sympathize with a forward movement They did not make their deliberations nor this declaraTHE REFORM MOVEMENT IN JUDAISM 323 tion public at once for they felt that the time was not yet ripe they desired to secure first the cooperation of sympathizers throughout Germany The declaration of principles together with a prefatory address setting forth the objects and aims of the society was sent privately to prominent men in various localities to obtain their signatures this delayed the work greatly as it took weeks at times to secure one signature as a result only some fifty signatures had been obtained by the beginning of August I8431 The most celebrated of the men whom they addressed were Gabriel Riesser of Hamburg the dauntless champion of Jewish political emancipation in the German States who had expressed frequently his sympathy with the movement for religious reform2 and Dr M A Stern of Gottingen who had been present at some of the preliminary meetings Letters were exchanged whose purpose was the free and unhampered expression of opinions these letters were of a confidential nature but some of those that passed between Riesser and Stern were given out for publication by an adherent of the orthodox party into whose hands they had fallen3 together with excerpts from the proceedings of the society which had been altogether private these extracts were garbled and edited in a manner to discredit the society which in self defence was now forced to give to the public prints the address and declaration mentioned above This was in August 1843 These official documents of the society were three in number marked A B and C A was a circular letter accompanying the documents B was the address which explained the reasons and aims of the movement and was entitled Programme of a Declaration of German

undertaking with which a number of reputable Israelites had declared themselves in sympathy and for the further ance of which many highly respected men in Germany were ready The founders of the society requested the signatures of all who do not expect a Messiah to lead them back to Palestine all who do not accord any authority or obligatory power to the confused and fre quently meaningless rabbinical interpretations and injunc tions all who strive for a form of faith whose enlivening principle is pure Mosaism The letter asserted further that reform in Judaism existed in reality and that all that was necessary was an open declaration as a result of this the reform movement would be sure to receive fitting recognition and become a working force in Jewish life The socalled programme opens with a eulogy of Moses and the religion he established this religion is capable of unceasing development however many of the insti tutions of Mosaism were of a national character and dependent upon the possession of a particular land When in the course of time the land was lost and the nationality came to an end many of the Mosaic ordinances ceased to exercise any binding force eg the laws regulating the ownership of land the prerogatives of the priests and Levites the sacrificial ritual and the criminal code Their place was taken however by a mass of ritual and cere monial laws to which in time the greatest importance came to be attached and Judaism became a system of observances whereby the spiritual content and import of 1 These documents were published in full in Freunds Zur Judenfrage in Deutschland 1843 pp 25765 and as the supplement to no 44 of Vol IV I843 of the Israelit des neunzehnten JahrhundertsTHE REFORM MOVEMENT IN JUDAISM 325 the religion were dimmed This externalism assumed ever greater prominence during the ages of exclusion and oppression the Jew clung to every observance custom and ceremony that had developed in the course of the ages When however the era of freedom dawned men arose who realized with dismay how far Judaism had travelled along this path and how pronounced was the difference between the inner purity and dignity of the divine truth of the religion and the external form that it had assumed The new opportunities had been grasped by such as these and they had acquired the culture of the people among whom they lived They sought to extricate the jewel of Judaism from the dross with which it had become encrusted they found their inspiration in the prophets of the Old Testament who had pro claimed that the spirit of the religion was independent of the blood of bullocks Yet attempts at reform up to this time consisted merely in liturgical imitations of other religions or in compromises with the followers of rabbinism Rarely did any one think of emphasizing the capacity of Mosaismfor unending development In so far the charge is true that no decisive step has been taken by the Jews to con form their religious practice to the higher culture to which they owe their intellectual progress Civilization has fieed them fiom rabbinical jurisdiction it must be our task to purify the religion of all antiquated disfigurements and present it in a worthy form In our day the difference between the inner truth of Judaism and its external form has become especially acute Nurtured by the intellectual culture of the age many of those who are accounted members of the Mosaic religious community have arrived at the conviction that most of the practical commands the observance of which constitutes the bulk of presentday Judaism rest on human and temporary premises They claim rightfully that this external form is for the most part without significance yes even unworthy of pure religion and they draw the inner content of divine truth326 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW which an earlier generation found in the Law from those treasures of wisdom alone which have won over to the truth so many great spirits of all nations Thus thousands have renounced allegiance to Talmudic rabbinical Judaism and are connected outwardly with the Mosaic religious community only by habit or by the control of the state or by family ties This condition of affairs is destructive and immoral for as long as a man lives in a community he should not pass as something altogether different ex ternally from what he is in thought and inner conviction The Jew who has grown indifferent to his religion on this account must decide whether he will continue to be known merely as a Jew by birth thus sacrificing freewill to habit and being deprived of all outward religious association that is expressive of his inner conviction orwhether longing for some tangible form he will join some other religious association But those who cannot content themselves with either of these alternatives will pin their faith to the belief in the capacity of Judaism for development and instead of continuing in a state of indolent lethargy will aim to harmonize their spiritual convictions with their professions Moved by these considerations a number of German Israelites have determined to give expression to their opinions of the present conditions in Judaism through a public declaration and to renounce formally their allegiance to all objectionable commands and to all antiquated customs which to all intents and purposes they have rejected long ago They disclaimed any purpose of desiring to obtain through this declaration more political rights than were accorded to the strict observers of the rabbinical code neither did they intend to formulate any dogmas or create a sect or a schism all that they purposed was an open honest statement of facts and beliefs as had obtained in Jewish life for a number of years past and particularly did they desire to convince competent religious teachers that truth has a home in Israel and to encourage such to support with all the weight of their learning theTHE REFORM MOVEMENT IN JUDAISM 327 religious standpoint of truthloving laymen The address concludes with the words least of all is it our desire to hurt the susceptibilities of the strict adherents of rabbinical Judaism Let us hope that success will crown this our honest endeavour not only to give our religion a worthier form but also to expound the pure content of Jlldaism and to remove from it everything which has degraded and dishonoured it in the eyes of thinking men Every participant in this movement feels already great inner satisfaction in that he has chosen his standpoint in reference to the highest spiritual interests and has paid allegiance to the truth Let us begin bravely then a task not only necessary from the civic standpoint and intellectually justified but also highly moral and in all truth pleasing to God Hereupon followed the famous Declaration it consisted of three paragraphs as follows 1 We recognize the possibility of unlimited development in the Mosaic religion 2 The collection of controversies dissertations and prescriptions commonly designated by the name Talmud possesses for us no authority either from the dogmatic or the practical standpoint 3 A Messiah who is to lead back the Israelites to the land of Palestine is neither expected nor desired by us we know no fatherland except that to which we belong by birth or citizenship As already mentioned the publication of these documents was premature and had been forced by the excitement aroused by the reports circulated by the enemies of the society in the public prints it had been the intention of the founders of the society to refrain from all public activity and agitation until so many signatures had been obtained from all sections of Germany as to prove that this was a great popular movement they had not had time to accomplish this purpose if in truth it could ever have been accomplished with the programme they had formulated328 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW This of course must remain conjecture for all time the facts in the case are that the publication of the documents of the society called forth a storm of opposition and denunciation that was in truth overwhelming orthodox conservatives moderates reformers all joined in reprehending the pre sumption of this handful of men whose address and de claration showed how ill prepared they were for the task they had undertaken and how inadequately they understood the true import of Jewish development The thunders of the opposition sounded from all quarters the rabbisfrom Holdheiml Geiger and Einhorn the reformers to Trier and Ettlinger the uncompromisingly orthodoxwrote in criti cism and disparagement the society found but one sym pathizer and defender among the rabbis M Hess of Saxe Weimar But not only among the rabbis was this resistance met with the most prominent layman in all Germany was Gabriel Riesser as soon as he became acquainted with the three points of the declaration he announced his unalter able opposition in a letter to Stern although an active and enthusiastic advocate of religious reform he declared the Frankfort movement a step backward rather than a step forward He feared also the impression that the paragraphs of the declaration would make upon the general public the first he considered a mere phrase the second and third were simple retorts upon the watchwords of Judaeophobia lie despised this tendency for it does not serve the truth its only purpose is the effect it may produce upon the civic authorities Stern answered him at length but I pass this answer by for the present since I shall give at length his elaborate defence of the society which appeared some time later3 Riesser found no time to reply to Stern but 1 Except in the circumcision controversy in which Holdheim supported the position assumed by members of the society infra 2 Isler Gabriel Riessers Leben nebst Mittheilungen aus seinen Briefen I 3589 3 The society itself answered its critics in an official document dated December I843 and signed by Dr Neukirch in the name of the members of the society The statements in the document are quite the same asTHE REFORM MOVEMENT IN JUDAISM 329 that he had not been convinced appears from the fact that when the affairs of the society became a matter of newspaper comment in the summer of I843 and Stern and Riesser were named as its chief sponsors Riesser denied this state ment publicly and declared his opposition to the society  The most striking attacks upon the organizat on were made by Leopold Stein rabbi in Burgkunstadt Bavaria and elected rabbi of Frankfort in March I8442 M Gutmann rabbi in Redwitz 3 S D Luzzato 4 David Einhorn 5 Michael Sachs6 Zacharias Frankel7 and by many others whose opinions were published in the collection of responses gathered by the old rabbi of Frankfort Solomon Abraham Trier and which will receive extended notice in the course of this article when the attitude of the society on the circumcision question will be considered The most notable defence was that of M A Stern in answer to the attacks of Stein Gutmann Einhorn Hirsch and Mannheimer the society was also defended by M Hess in five leading articles in his newspaper8 In these articles he applauds the act of the founders of the society he states that the Jews have advanced but not Judaism and that official Judaism is at fault that life calls for reforms and that this declara those made by Stern and given at length in the course of this article See Freunds Zur Judenfrage in Deutschland I844 pp 1622 see also Algemeine Zeitung des

their method was not that of Judaism 8 Israelit des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts IV 1843 183 187 191 I95 and 203330 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW tion is the first evidence that enlightened Jews have given of a clear understanding of the situation He defends the society from the chief charges that had been made against it these charges were that the three paragraphs of the Declaration are not farreaching enough that they are only negative thus Frankel called them articles of un belief and Einhorn  a confession of unbelief that they were indefinite that the third paragraph discredits the patriotism of Jews who still believe in the personal Messiah and the return to Palestine and lastly that it was fathered altogether by laymen and nontheologians while theolo gians alone could and should inaugurate such a movement I cannot stop to give Hesss reply to these charges and criticisms notably as I feel that space should be given primarily to the defence of M A Stern which also answered these points The open letters of Stern written in answer to the attacks upon the society by Rabbis Stein and Gutmann are the most remarkable literary product of the agitation called forth by the formation of the Reform Society 1 He takes up the criticisms of Stein and Gutmann point for point and answers them without reserve often sharply sarcastically and caustically A brief re4sume of his argument makes unnecessary the separate quoting of the objections of Stein and Gutmann as these are indicated sufficiently in the reply The first letters are addressed to Stein The reason for laymen taking the initiative was that rabbis had not done so although they had bewailed frequently the sorry condition of affairs in Judaism and had declared reform absolutely necessary2 The Reform Society inspired by these statements had taken the bold plunge but had indicated in its declaration only 1 The open letters to Einhorn Hirsch and Mannheimer in Nos 68 of vol VI of the Israelit des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts consist for the most part of mere personalities and therefore I dismiss them with this reference they were the third series of open letters the first two series to Stein and Gutmann contain the gist of the defence 2 Israelit des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts 1844 I74 See also M Creizenach Desfrommen Israeliten Lehre und Leben ibid II 21THE REFORM MOVEMENT IN JUDAISM 331 the absolutely necessary doctrines that would appeal to the contemporary generation as expressing the idea of de velopment in Judaism  In answer to Steins designation of them as reformers he says We are not reformers we could not and would not be We are merely reformed the age advanced intelligence possibly also progressive rabbinism are the reformers We desire to make no proselytes we wish to induce no one who is not of a like opinion with us to join us we have merely called upon such who think as we do to combine with us There fore the Declaration is drawn up in such a way as to express our individual view 2 As for the third paragraph concerning the Messiah rabbis had said the same thing time and time again and Stein does not even advert to this paragraph in his criticism hence he must agree with it 3 As to the second declaration Stein does not argue he simply accuses us of not knowing the Talmud Stern answers sarcastically and enters a flat denial claiming that they do know the Talmud this however is not to the point the point is the authority of the Talmud  The Talmud shall receive acknowledgment for all that is of value in it We have denied only its authority not its historical value 4 It is the first paragraph of the Declara tion however that has been made to bear the brunt of the hostile attacks and yet what does it say That the members of the society recognize in Mosaism the possibility of unlimited development what does this imply but the principle of reform something which progressive rabbinism the religious standpoint of Stein has declared time and again 5 Stern then discusses the permanent element in Judaism this is certainly not the ceremonies as progressive rabbinism has stated often certainly not the belief in miracles cer tainly not metaphysical truths which are rare in the Bible  What then is the permanent element in Judaism  Nothing Israelit des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts 1844 I75 2 ibid 179 3 ibid I80 4 ibid i8I 5 ibid I88332 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW else is unchangeably permanent except the glorious idea of its worldembracing destiny to which its whole history bears witness nothing else but its divine mission to develop within itself the belief in God and to spread this over the whole earth Therefore too it must be able to appreciate the ideas of all ages and the conditions of all places there fore it must not be limited by any temporal institution It must eliminate all institutions that have outlived their usefulness and must bear within itself the possibility of unlimited development The Reform Society considered it a bounden duty to give expression to this thought it is a jewel which has been recovered out of stunted rabbinical Judaism 1 The purpose of the Reform Society was simply to make this general declaration not to carry it out in practical reforms as applicable to special Mosaic laws this is to be the work of the rabbis Some of the members of the society the writer among them wished to go farther and specify certain Mosaic institutions that have outlived their original significance but the majority decided otherwise on the ground that their chief purpose was to gain the adherence of all who believe in the principle that Mosaism is capable of unlimited development2 In answer to Steins question in what the society was specifically Jewish and whether the most orthodox Christian or Moslem could not become a member he says that the first paragraph shows that this is impossible because neither Christian nor Moslem believes in the possibility of the unlimited development of Mosaism holding as they do that a new revelation was necessary for the salvation of mankind 3 He denies the statement made frequently at that time that Bruno Bauers essay on the Jewish question4 was I Israelit des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts I844 I90 2 ibid 3 ibid 197 4 Die Judenfrage in Deutsche JahrbUicher for Nov I842 published separ ately Brunswick 1843 This antiSemitic essay was one of the literary andTHE REFORM MOVEMENT IN JUDAISM 333 the direct cause of the formation of the society The deliberations looking to its formation began in September 1842 in the beginning of November the writer had com municated with Dr Riesser on the subject and Bauers essay did not appear till several weeks later  He meets Steins charge that the doings of the society retarded the civil emancipation of the orthodox Jews by saying if you demand that we shall not retard your civil emancipation we may demand certainly with equal justice that you should not interfere with our spiritual emancipa tion for what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander We are not enacting a farce nor is our society a mere matter of convenience that we will abandon at your desire we have a sacred duty to fulfil which is nothing less than to extricate ourselves from a thoroughly false religious situation 2 Stein had averred that the paragraphs of theDeclaration were purely negative Stern retorts by calling upon him to show the way and to give them something positive fortified with reasons taken not from policy but from Jewish theology with reasons that do not presuppose the authority of the Talmud and which would therefore not satisfy us 3 He denies that he is the author of the official documents of the society and claims that he saw them only after they were published4 he closes with journalistic sensations of that day and elicited many replies from Jews the claim of the enemies of the Reform Society that this essay gave the impulse to its formation rested without doubt upon the passage of the essay in w hich Eauer comments upon the statement of the advocates of the emancipation of the Jews that they desire to return to pure Mosaism he declares this to be senseless since Mosaism means sacrifice priestly caste and peculiar property legislation its logical consequence is the Talmud both Old Testament and Talmud are chimerical and unreal emancipation will be impossible until the Jews cease to be Jews and become menin other words  when they become in reality men who will not permit themselves to be separated from their fellow men by any barrier mistakenly considered essential 1 Israelit des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts I844 198 2 ibid I99 s ibid 200 i ibid 20o334 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW accusing the progressive rabbis among whom Stein classed himself of cowardice and with wishing to conciliate both parties and hence with having no definite principles  You and all who share your opinion are greatly mistaken thus he addresses Stein in taking eave of the subject you will never succeed in conciliating the orthodox party they will use you against progress so long as you permit yourselves to be used but the moment you presume to act against their will you will be damned The orthodox know full well that they cannot surrender one iota without en dangering their whole position You will alienate more and more the cultured and progressive elements because you refuse to satisfy the demands of culture inasmuch as your practical reforms restrict themselves to a few changes in the service What is the gain of such a scarcely perceptible advance Is this the only factor the only institution in which salvation is to be found or is it not rather in the purified religious consciousness for whose edification the external institutions will adapt themselves of necessity  If you are not possessed of courage then be content to lose yourselves among the crowd and do not aspire to leadership least of all should you glorify your faint heartedness as the correct policy and call the courageous foolhardy Let him who is cowardly and fainthearted turn back and go to his home Judaism will fulfil its mission without you and in spite of you help and salvation will come from another place  In his open letter to Gutmann Stern discusses first the Messianic question and shows how the hope for the coming of the Messiah has developed in Judaism he challenges Gutmanns statement that this hope runs like a red thread through the Bible the Pentateuch says nothing concerning it nor do many of the prophets it is a late growth on the stem of Jewish thought and thousands of the present generation have repudiated it this being the case how can they utter the prayers supplicating for the coming 1 Israelit des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts 1844 9ogTHE REFORM MOVEMENT IN JUDAISM 335 of a Messiah and the rebuilcling of Jerusalem such prayer is really blasphemy for it is equivalent to uttering a false hood  if we make supplication to God for something the direct opposite of which we wish for in our hearts what is this but a mockery  does it not change prayer the purest relation of man to God into shocking blasphemy   He therefore declares that he will cease to attend the synagogue as long as these conditions exist unless forced to do so by law a possible contingency in view of certain proposed strange legislation It is absolutely necessary for the Reform Society to institute a service which will express the honest convictions of the Jew of today He calls upon the rabbis to revise the prayerbook as proposed by the rabbinical conference just held at Brunswick2 and to eliminate altogether those prayers which are at variance with the peoples belief the attempt has been made it is true to eliminate some of these prayers but is a lie less a lie because it is uttered once instead of ten times 2 3  Since the authority of the Talmud was repudiated the Bible was accepted naturally as the allimportant authority but the letter of the Bible is dead like every letter and becomes living only if it receives the breath of the spirit it requires human interpretation4 The meaning of the first paragraph of the Declaration is this  the progressive development of mankind is unlimited if Judaism is to keep pace with this if it is to share in the shaping of the future of mankind ie if it is not to pass away it must contain within itself the possibility of unlimited develop ment This is the plain meaning of the first paragraph of our Declaration 5 There must be development in religion the divine is perfect it is true but it must accommodate itself to human imperfection hence a command suitable for one age may be outgrown by a subsequent age thus bloodrevenge is 1Israelit des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts I844 287 2 June X219 x844 3 Israelit des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts V 287 4 ibid 290 5 ibid 294336 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW sanctioned in the Bible but this does not mean that all future ages must regard this primitive institution as sacred  Mankind outgrows laws which were formulated for earlier imperfect stages of civilization as a child outgrows its clothes the law ceases to be operative of itself as soon as the conditions that gave it birth cease Hence if we do not wish to surrender the sublime conception of the continual progress of mankind we will have to concede that religion the expression of the human cognition of God must keep pace with this progressive development  He proceeds to explain the purpose of the Reform Society Away with all explanations that simply introduce new shackles of the law in place of the old ones let us thank God that Judaism has no dogmas away with attempts at compromise in this our time in which scarcely any two persons think alike in religious matters What we can and should do is to clear away that which is dead for this we should unite in active endeavourthis is the purpose of the Reform Society 2 Gutmann had charged that the Reform Society denied divine revelation Stern replies with a definition of revelation as the progressive advance of the spirit of man belief in the literal revelation as described in the Bible Exod xixxxi is not defended by any but the most orthodox the least rationalizing of this passage would lay any one open to the charge directed against the Reform Society and surely Gutmann would not defend the literal acceptance of this passage which states that God descended upon Mount Sinai that he spoke that the elders saw God that Moses approached God c and continues It must be proved whether the positive element of Judaism consists of stories or of its history in Geschichten oder in seiner Geschichte of the manner in which it grew or of that which it became 3  he demands from Gutmann 1 Israelit des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts V 296 2 ibid 297 3  Es muss sich zeigen ob das Positive des Judenthums in Geschichten oder in seiner Geschichte in der Art wie es geworden oder in dem was es geworden besteht Ibid 304THE REFORM MOVEMENT IN JUDAISM 337 a statement as to whether he accepts this passage of Exodus literally if he does not he occupies the same platform as the Reform Society Despite this spirited and full defence the society one might almost say died aborning  Yet although it proved so flat and wellnigh complete a failure as a practical or ganization and although its founders did not grasp or comprehend the true significance of the development of Judaism one point cannot be denied nor may it be over looked and that is that the Frankfort Reform Society was an honest attempt to make open declaration of the sentiments that were entertained by a large section of Jews Reform was an accomplished fact in the lives and thoughts of thousands the commands of traditional Judaism were not observed by them Judaism had entered upon a new stage the Reform Society was a sign of the times its promoters wished to square profession with practice That its Declaration was inadequate and its method illchosen that its procedure was violent instead of ordered that it simply negatived instead of building up fiom a sure and positive foundation that it represented revolution rather than reform1 schism rather than con tinuous development may not blind our eyes to the all important merits of honesty of intention and recognition of the true state of affairs in Jewry2 But their action was little more than a spasmodic outburst the three articles of their creed evince all the limitation of their thought and their failure to grasp the true idea of de 1 See A Rebensteins remarkable article Unsere Gegenwart in Freunds Zur Judenfrage in Deutschland II 13 ff 22 if This and the article by Dr S Holdheim having the same title ibid I497i are two most striking statements of the condition of religious affairs among the Jews of Germany at this stirring time and of the true meaning and purpose of reform 2 See the letter of Dr Theodor Creizenach one of the founders of the society written on Sept 2 I843 to Dr Wilhelm Freund the editor of the magazine Zur Judenfrage in Deutschland and published in Vol II of the same pp 1758 also the editorial article on the purpose of the society in Israelit des neunz Jahrh VI i845 i6I VOL XVII Z338 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW velopment in Judaism which is the keystone in the arch of reform This appears clearly and unmistakably from the first two paragraphs of the Declaration viz the cry back to Mosaism and the repudiation of the Talmud It was fashionable in those days for antirabbinical and antiTalmudical Jews to affect the style and title of pro fessors of the Mosaic Faith Bekenner des mosaischen Glaubens indicating thus their hostile attitude towards the Talmud 1 this earned for them the soubriquets of Mosaites and Protestant Jews for it was claimed that theirs was an attitude similar to that taken by the Protestants of the Reformation period in the history of Christianity viz the acceptance of the Bible and the repudiation of all subsequent tradition Now the true knowledge of Judaism makes it clear that the Books of Moses and the remaining writings preserved in the Bible represent stages in the development of Judaism as do the literary remains of every succeeding era the Bible made Judaism as little as did the Talmud Judaism brought forth the books of the Bible as well as the Talmud and all other products of the Jewish spirit Hence it is an utter misunderstanding of Judaism to disregard any phase of its development each age had its needs and met them as well as it could the Talmud and the codes served their purpose in the outworking of the faith as well as did the Biblical books what is true in either is eternal what was temporary in either was for special times and circumstances but from both as from every expression of the spirit of Judaism true reform draws its inspiration It is folly to limit the possibilities of Judaism to the content of Mosaism it is folly no less to attempt to erase from the record the cen turies marked by the rise and rule of Talmudism every mode of expression that Judaism has assumed Mosaism prophetism Talmudism rabbinism even cabbalism con tributes its quota to the understanding of the essentials 1 See five leading articles entitled Der reine Mosaismus Pure Mosaism in the Israelit des neunz Jahrh I 1841 I 5 9 13 17THE REFORM MOVEMENT IN JUDAISM 339 each represents the fitting of the eternal elements ofthe faith to particular circumstances this is the principle at the root of the reform movement and therefore those who interpreted it correctly defined it as a new phase in the agelong development a new aspect produced by the new revelation of God in the unfolding of the ages 1 This the Frankfort reformers failed utterly to grasp The third paragraph of their Declaration repudiating the belief in the personal Messiah and the return to Palestine was correct in itself as a tenet of the reform movement but should have been merely one of a number of statements instead of being posited as the only special declaration the other two being of a general character The almost unanimous disapproval of the society was justified by the facts in the case and it takes its place in 1 Holdheim particularly gave expression to this thought I reproduce several of his significant statements on the subject c The present requires a principle that shall enunciate clearly that a law even though divine is potent only so long as the conditions and circumstances of life to meet which it was enacted continue when thee change however the law also must be abrogated even though it have God for its author For God himself has shown indubitably that with the change of the circumstances and conditions of life for which he once gave those laws the laws them selves cease to be operative that they shalU be observed no longer because they can be observed no longer    The present age and its guiding principle as thus formulated recognize the working of God in history it believes truly and firmly in the providential guidance of the lortunes of mankind it looks upon the deeds recorded in the history of mankind as the deeds of God whereby he speaks as clearly as he ever did a par ticular revelation of God to a single person is dispensable when God speaks to all and reveals his will to all Freunds Zur Judenfrage in Deutschland II I65 f True reform can rest only on the recognition of the truth that God commanded certain laws for certain times and certain conditions of life and that it would be acting against the divine will to fulfil the law by a forced and casuistical interpretation of its meaning after the conditions have changed so essentially as to preclude the carryingout of the law in its correct and original significance Ibid Salomon put this same idea in a most striking way at the Conference of Rabbis held at Brunswick in 1844 when he said The age also is a Bible through whose mouth God speaks to Israel auch die Zeit sei eine Bibel durch deren Mund Gott zu Israel spricht Protokolle der ersten RabbinerVersammlung 91 Braunschweig 1844 Z X340 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW the history of the reform movement not for any full and rounded interpretation it gave of the purpose of this move ment but as one of the significant births of that period of travail the fifth decade of the nineteenth century Still it is quite possible that this Reform Society would not have been the storm centre of so fierce a tempest had it con fined itself to the theoretical statements comprised in its programme and not become identified with the agitation that shook the Frankfort community from centre to cir cumference in connexion with the circumcision question This it was which really roused its opponents As men tioned above the first draft of the Declaration contained five paragraphs the third of which asserted that the mem bers of the society do not consider circumcision binding either as a religious act or symbol Although this paragraph was eliminated from the final draft it expressed the con victions of a majority of the members of the society and when an instance really occurred of a father neglecting to have his child circumcised 1 the excitement aroused in the community knew no bounds2 The attention of the sanitary bureau of Frankfort had been called to the fatal outcome of a number of cases of circumcision in order to prevent such mishaps in the 1 This man was not a member of the Reform Society but his action was in sympathy with the expressed views of the members of the society therefore the society was made the target for the shafts of the opposition It was not long before a second similar case of neglect to have the rite performed occurred and this time the offending father was a member of the society Israelit des neunz Jahrh V 24 2 At this time an anonymous publication appeared entitled Circum cision historically and dogmatically considered by Ben Amithai Ueber die Beschneidung in historischer unct dogmatischer Beziehung this publication was looked upon generally as a pronouncement of the Reform Society the author put the question Is circumcision an absolute condition of Judaism so that an uncircumcised child cannot be considered a Jew or is it not p 5 He answered the question in the negative and sug gested another method of initiation into Judaism viz a solemn declaration by the father in an assembly of ten Israelites that he desired to have the child received into the covenant made by God with Abraham and MosesTHE REFORM MOVEMENT IN JUDAISM 341 future this bureau promulgated a measure placing the circumcision of Jewish children under the direct super vision of the sanitary office the third paragraph of this measure ordered that  Israelitish citizens and inhabitants in as far as they desire to have their children circumcised sofern sie ihre Kinder beschneiden lassen wollen may employ only persons especially appointed to perform the rite of circumcision Members of the Reform Society and others who sympathized with them interpreted these words to mean that the rite of circumcision was to be performed or omitted at the desire of the father It was not long before the actual occurrence took place that made the matter a living issue The question as to whether circumcision was a conditio sine qua non of entrance into Judaism had been discussed at the meetings of the Reform Society it had become known that Riesser had urged that the society should institute active propaganda for the abolition of the rite the final determination of the society not to include the circumcision paragraph in its Declaration had been one of the chief reasons why he had refused to be identified with it 1 Although it is true that at the time the agitation broke forth the society had not made any public official declaration pro or con the sen timents of its members were well known and it became identified in the public mind with the anticircumcision agitation The aged rabbi of Frankfort Solomon Abraham Trier believing that one of the very fundamentals of Judaism had been wantonly disregarded by the individuals who had neglected to have their children circumcised addressed the Senate on February 26 1843 calling the attention of the lawmaking body to the importance of circumcision from the religious standpoint and pointing out the dangers that would threaten the integrity of the Jewish community were the performance or omission of this rite to be left to the caprice of the individual father he therefore requested the Senate to issue a de 1 Isler Gabriel Riessers Leben nebst Mittheilungen aus seinen Briefen I 360342 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW finite declaration that should counteract the effect of that phrase in the regulation of the sanitary bureau which had been seized upon by the opponents of circumcision as a justification of their position the phrase namely in as far as they desire to have their children circumcised The Senate answered him on March Io by saying that it was not the intention of the regulation in question to abolish a religious ordinance of the Jews This however was not definite enough and the agitation continued un abated The danger of calling in the aid of the State to decide upon the private concerns of a religious community was pointed out by clear thinkers but the old rabbi and his party felt that the very existence of Judaism was im perilled and hence considered any and every step justified even the employment of force through the legislative arm On August 4 Trier again appealed to the Senate requesting that it declare that no child of Jewish parents could be received into the congregation as a coreligionist unless he had been circumcised he made similar representations on September r5 and October 31 the Senate took action in the matter on February 13 1844 by expressing its regret that certain members of the Jewish community gave cause for complaint to their coreligionists and by stating its inability to take the step suggested by Trier  This was a distinct defeat for the rabbinical party and its illadvised move to secure the support of the civil power against the nonconformists It has been shown in a previous article2 how frequently this was done in those days certainly nothing is more harmful to the true interests of religion than the use of force through the instrumentality of the government to ensure the fulfil ment of its behests and commands 3 t Israedit des neunz Jahrh V 69 74 84 2 J Q R XV 501 3 For an excellent account of the numerous attempts to enlist the aid of the government against the reformers see Jost Geschichte der Israeliten X part iii 22534THE REFORM MOVEMENT IN JUDAISM 343 Trier did not confine his activity to these attempts to secure governmental interference He addressed also a com munication to the rabbis of Europe asking for their opinions upon the Reform Society and upon the significance of circumcision His communication appeared as the intro duction to the volume Rabbinical Responses on Circum cision 1 He speaks of the Reform Society as schismatic and as masquerading under the deceptive guise of reform but as being in reality the opponent of positive Judaism he denounces it as a new sect2 standing outside the pale of Judaism3 he pleads for the preservation of positive Judaism which is exposed to the devastating hurricane of a misunderstood spirit of the age 4 he asks for an opinion on the new sect and invites suggestions as to what measures should be taken against such as refuse to have their sons circumcised through frivolity and unbelief The commu nication was sent to eighty rabbis fortyone responses were received and twentyeight were printed in the volume desig nated these were from the rabbis Samson Raphael Hirsch of Emden Nathan Marcus Adler of Hanover Felsenstein of Hanau Lazar Horwitz of Vienna Jacob Aaron Ettlinger of Altona S Ullmann of Crefeld M Wetzlar of Gudens berg Adler of Oberndorf Samuel Hirsch of Luxembourg Seligmann Bar Bamberger of Wiirzburg A

Hiirben All of these responses took strong ground in favour of circumcision in fact it was stated that all the responses which had been 1 Rabbinische Gutachten iiber die Beschneidung gesammelt und herausgegeben von Salomon Abraham Trier Frankfurt am Main I844 2 ibid IX s ibid XIII 4 ibid VI344 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW received were uncompromisingly and unreservedly opposed to the Reform Society and its position This was not quite in accordance with the facts in the case for the response of Rabbi Elias Griinebaum was suppressed because of the difference of his views with those of the rabbi of Frankfort 1 Zunz also wrote a response which was however not included in the volume but was published separately 2 In this the great scholar took positive ground against the abolition of the rite he warns against heresy trials and ecclesiastical penalties he urges that the father who fails to have his son circumcised continue to be recognized as a Jew he would not have the synagogue closed to him nor give him pain although he give pain to others But circumcision is of the very essence of Judaism It is riot a ceremony but an institution not the act of circumcising but the being circumcised is the kernel of the command Other acts take place frequently in life if neglected they can be atoned for and performed In this case however a single omission is decisive and the son who has not been circum cised by his father because of principle will scarcely remain within Judaism for principles sake It is not necessary to quote very extensively from the opinions contained in the volume published by Trier Men of all shades of thought are represented in the volume Samuel Hirsch the reformer Isaac Noa Mannheimer the conservative and Jacob Aaron Ettlinger the ultraorthodox clasp hands in agreement upon the question at issue although their reasons may not be the same The twenty eight responses present a practical unanimity of opinion to the effect that an Israelite who denies the obligatory character of the command to circumcise and neglects to 1 This response was published in the Israelit des neunz Jahrh V 1215 I2932 with an editorial footnote that it had been suppressed

denier of the divine law and a destroyer of the eternal covenant S R Hirsch stated that by such declarations and acts they the members of the Reform Society have cut themselves loose from Judaism and the rabbi of the community to which they belong must treat them as no longer members of his community they are apostates mumrirm The response of N M Adler rabbi in Hanover is of interest because of his election shortly thereafter as chief rabbi of Great Britain Adler considers the question from three standpoints the Biblical the historical and the religiophilosophical he shows that although commentators and philosophers may have differed widely as to the signi ficance of circumcision this one explaining it as a symbol of purification that one as a sign of priestly selection this one giving it a social that one an ethical and a third a sanitary interpretation yet all agreed as to its being an absolute requiLement for the Jew he therefore concludes that the one who disregards the command is an apostate and incurs all the sad consequences which the law ordains in the case of apostates all association with him must cease2 he must be looked upon as excluded from the congregation of Israel 3 The renowned scholar S D Luzzatto of Padua declared that the members of the society are heretics and deniers of the Mosaic Law and that according to their own con fession they stand without the pale of the Jewish religion His response however evinces a beautiful spirit although positive in his attitude of unfailing opposition to the Reform Society and although he opines that no congrega tional office or honour should be bestowed on its members or any gift or offering be received from them yet he recommends leniency and counsels that words of truth and peace be addressed to them possibly thereby they 1 Rabbinische Gutachten iuber die Beschneidung 4 2 ibid 13 3 ibid 14346 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW will be induced to renounce their error and return to the right path1 The Viennese preacher I N Mannheimer disputes the right of the few to break away from the great community Judaism is a historical system it rests not on philosophy it is life it is experience it is made up of a thousand forces and any violent action such as this of the Reform Society is treason to the spirit of Judaism He apostro phizes the Reform Society thus  Cut yourselves loose from us you have nothing in common with us You speak of the force which we apply to you and to your conscience and do you expect us to submit humbly to your capricious procedure do you expect for one instant that we shall or can permit that each and every one shall obey or disregard the commands of our religion according to individual whim or caprice that any and every in significant or irresponsible person shall arise and con temptuously disregard Talmud and commentators today and Moses and the prophets tomorrow 2  Further along he asserts that the refusal to have a child circumcised is equivalent to a renunciation of the covenant of God 3 he de clares also that should such a case occur in his congregation he would not admit the boy to any Jewish function would not register him as a Jew would not confirm nor marry him nor permit him to be buried in a Jewish cemetery in Austria no Jewish child is registered unless circumcised 4 Finally the opinion of S L Rapoport the celebrated scholar and rabbi of Prague may be cited he presents the argument from history saying that from the time of Abraham none have questioned the fact that circumcision is a necessary condition for entrance into Judaism he indulges in the strongest terms of condemnation of the members of the Reform Society speaking of them as that frivolous company which denies the fundamental princi ples of our religion and confesses publicly that it does not 1 Rabbinische Gutachten iiber die Beschneidung 77 2 ibid 99 ioo 3 ibid loi 4 ibid Io2THE REFORM MOVEMENT IN JUDAISM 347 accept our traditions   those reformers have no definite standpoint in Judaism their only purpose is to break down all the preventive measures which the divine law has set up against human passions 2 we must exercise the greatest care and warn our coreligionists most earnestly to have no association of any kind with the members of this Reform Society particularly not to form any matri monial alliances with them 3 I refrain from quoting any further from these opinions since the extracts which have been given indicate the sentiment that runs throughout the volume as already mentioned each and every one represented in this collection argued strongly and often passionately in favour of circumcision as an absolute re quirement for the Jew it is but just however that the other side also be given a hearing and I therefore feel it necessary to introduce the opinions of the two leading reformers of the time Geiger and Holdheim Although Geiger was quite as opposed to the course pursued by the Reform Society as were the strict traditionalists 4 still he sympathized with them in their opposition to circumcision in a letter to Zunz written March 19 1845 he says in discussing Zunzs5 opinion on circumcision I was not in sympathy with the Reform Society it had no clear idea of what it was striving for neither was it honest enough in its utterances instead of proceeding calmly and sanely it aroused the greatest antagonism by attacking at once the rite of circumcision which was considered a very fundamental of Judaism As for myself I must confess Rabbinische Gutachten ilber die Beschneidung 26 2 ibid I37 3

the present day reverenced as sacred by the whole Jewish people Who will dare abrogate with impunity this holy rite  348 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW that I cannot comprehend the necessity of working up a spirit of enthusiasm for the ceremony merely on the ground that it is held in general esteem It remains a barbarous bloody act    the sacrificial idea which invested the act with sanctity in former days has no significance for us However tenaciously religious senti ment may have clung to it formerly at present its only supports are habit and fear to which we certainly do not wish to erect any shrinesl Geiger however did not express himself publicly in this wise this was written in a private communication Holdheim on the other hand issued a pamphlet entitled Circumicision Viewed Religiously and Dogmatically2 he considers the subject at length from three points I is circumcision so impor tant a condition in Judaism that the uncircumcised indi vidual who has been born of Jewish parents is not to be considered a Jew 2 is the father who neglects to have his son circumcised still to be considered a Jew  3 what is to be the attitude of the Jewish religious authoritative body if circumcision is neglected  may it resort to force in such cases as it has the power to do soto compel a father to have the ceremony performed or in case it has not the power may it call in the aid of the civil authorities 3 The third question he answered with a 1 Nachgelassete Schriften V i823 2 Ueber die Beschneidung in religiasdogmatischer Beziehung Schwerin and Berlin I844 3 The consideration of this third point was undoubtedly inspired by the utterances of Zacharias Frankel the exponent of positivehistorical Judaism in his magazine Zeitschrift fiir die religi8sen Interessen des Juden thums I 6o ff Frankel argued that if the father neglected to have his child circumcised the duty devolved upon the religious authoritative body It is only through circumcision that the born Israelite receives the real sanctification True by the very fact of his birth he is included in the congregation but he does not become a full member thereof till he is circumcised Therefore the act is to be considered partly in the light of a sacrament In Judaism even more than in Christianity the sacramental reception of the child devolves upon the spiritual repre sentatives of the community as a duty For in Christianity the child is entirely without the fold until baptized while in Judaism it is partlyTHE REFORM MOVEMENT IN JUDAISM 349 decisive negative the individuals freedom of conscience may not be tampered with by the application of force the religious leaders in Judaism may exercise only the task and the right to teach In regard to the first two points he contended that circumcision was a sign and condition of the theocraticnational but not of the religio universalistic covenant in Judaism not circumcision then makes the Jew but birth circumcision is not an all essential requirement in Judaism therefore both the father who neglected to circumcise his son and the son who was not circumcised are to be considered Jews 1 within owing to its birth The religious authoritative body is not to punish the father but to protect the child and should call in the aid of the civil power which is justified in interfering in such cases as threaten to disrupt Judaism 1 It will not be out of place to refer in this connexion to a most interesting case that occurred a few years later In 1847 a Mr Hirsch of Teterow MecklenburgSchwerin neglected to have his newlyborn son circumcised  he expressed the desire however to rear the child in the Jewish faith and insisted that it be entered in the registry of Jewish births and receive its name in the synagogue in accordance with the custom then existing in Mecklenburg The teacher Salinger who officiated in the community did not know how to proceed in this ex ceptional case he applied to the Jewish directorate for guidance this in its turn referred the case to Dr David Einhorn the chief rabbi of the province for decision Einhorn authorized the teacher to name the child in the synagogue and showed that even from the Talmudical standpoint the uncircumcised Jew is not to be excluded from the Jewish community if he has not wilfully declared his purpose to cut himself loose this is not the case in the present instance for the father has declared expressly his desire to rear the child as a Jew and certainly the innocent child is not to be excluded from the community for no fault of its own He closes his letter of instructions in the following lofty strain l May God bless the child and adorn it with the virtues of an Israelite indeed an Israelite of circumcised heart and may all those who think that the integrity of our divine religion which our forefathers sealed with their noble blood a thousand times as a covenant between God and Israel and all mankind is threatened by such occur rences and are therefore sorely troubled derive consolation from the thought that the divine by its very nature is imperishable and that Judaism rests on the indestructible pillars of right truth and peace which will not totter even though the earth wax old like a garment and the heavens vanish like smoke The child was named in the350 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW The result of all this agitation was to leave the question as to the necessity of circumcision as a conditio sine qua non of Judaism mueh the same as it had been before With the fewest exceptions the authoritative voices had expressed themselves strongly in the affirmative Holdheim and Hess stood alone among the theologians in their radical views on the subject Geiger apparently agreed with them but he did not give utterance to his views otherwise than in private correspondence Practically the ceremony con tinued to be and still is almost universally observed the rabbinical conference that met in Breslau in 1846 made a number of declarations of a practical bearing but uttered no decisive opinion on the cardinal point of the essentiality or nonessentiality of the ceremony at the meeting of the Central Conference of American Rabbis held in the city of New York in I892 the majority of the members present voted that circumcision was not necessary in the case of proselytes to Judaism There are many Jews today who feel as did the Frankfort reformers of I843 that circum cision is a relic of barbarism and should make way for some other method of initiation into Judaism more in consonance with the universalistic interpretation of the faith It is to be hoped that some representative rabbinical organization of the reform school like the Central Con ference of American Rabbis will take up this question in the near future and after considering it from all sides make some positive declaration in accordance with the standpoint of reformed Judaism All things considered the outcome of this whole agitation was a gain for the progressive movement Although the extremists who had called the Reform Society into being did not meet with much sympathy yet on the other hand it had become apparent that the days of usefulness of extremists at the other end of the scale like Trier were over and that the community of Frankfort required a rabbi synagogue on Sabbath Channukah See Allgemeine Zeitung des Judenthums

consummated In March of that year Leopold Stein rabbi of Burgkunstadt in Bavaria was elected as associate rabbi to Trier This choice of the directorate was extremely displeasing to the old rabbi and had the circumstances and the year been the same there would have been un doubtedly a repetition of the GeigerTiktin affair  but even during the short space of six years great changes had taken place in the religious atmosphere enveloping Jewry and the strenuous experience of Geiger was not repeated Still Trier did not accept the inevitable without a struggle a few weeks after the election of Stein he refused to deliver his semiannual derashah on the Great Sabbath2 he had protested to the Senate of the city against the election of Stein the Senate referred him to the directorate of the congregation as having jurisdiction in the premises Trier resigned as rabbi in May Stein who styled himself an adherent of the progressive rabbinical party at once began reforming the service as early as July 1844 he introduced sixteen liturgical reforms among them may be mentioned the change of the benedic tion wny NSw to nw  wyV the elimination of the benediction nw vw KW the substitution of an appro priate German prayer for the ltpql nlp and the ltw sn and the substitution of German songs for the tnq no and the mn 1 the introduction of the German sermon and the singing of German hymns before and after the sermon 1 JQR XVI 4 ff 2 Before the inception of the reform movement it had been customary for the rabbi to preach but twice or possibly three times a year viz on the Great Sabbath i e the Sabbath immediately preceding the Feast of Passover and on the Sabbath of Repentance i e the Sabbath of the ten days between the New Years Day and the Day of Atonement  these derashoth were not sermons in the homiletic sense but were halakhic in character being explanations of the laws to be observed in connexion with the holidays The third annual sermon was preached occasionally on the Eve of Atonement See Jewish Encyclopedia Art  Homiletics352 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW The activity of Stein in the reform cause although by no means satisfactory to the members of and sympathizers with the Reform Society for whom he did not go far enough still had the effect of taking the wind out of their sails The communal congregation having placed at its head a rabbi of the new school it was felt generally that there was no need for a special reform society or congrega tion In truth the Reform Society as an organization disappeared from the public communal life it was heard from but twice again once when it declared that the time had come for Sunday services to be introduced and ap pointed a committee of five to look for a suitable preacher and to request the congregation to grant the use of the Andachtssaal for this purpose1 and again when in June 845 it issued a circular letter in which it expresses gratifica tion at the progress of reform ideas after calling attention to what was done at the Brunswick rabbinical conference 2 it calls upon every Israelite to support the rabbis who are leading the hosts onward It welcomes the formation of the Reform Association of Berlin 3 It suggests a meeting of reformers from all over Germany in the fall of 1845 for the discussion of ways and means of uniting the various reform tendencies among German Jews The letter ends with the words let us remain united firm and loyal and the success of our efforts will discomfit the false zealots will put to shame the selfish indifferentists and Judaism will become the bond that unites us without separating us from our century our fatherland and mankind 4 These words may be considered the valedictory of the Frankfort Society considering that it had never in reality passed beyond the formative stage the prominent r6le that it played during two eventful years is remarkable that it gave a great impulse 1 Allgemeine Zeitung des Judenthums IX 709 2 This conference met June

IN JUDAISM 353 to the progressive movement not only in Frankfort but throughout Germany cannot be gainsaid nor can it be denied on the other hand that its members pursuing the method they did showed that they did not have the correct understanding of the development of Judaism The ex treme individualism and the animus against theologians and rabbis at once stamped the Society as partisan beyond measure but more than all else the absolute inadequacy of its platform proved that its founders were not competent leaders in that stormy period of Jewish life It represents however a groping for the light and although it failed signally in the work it set out to do still will it remain in Jewish annals as one of the most interesting episodes of a most stirring epoch It had panegyrists and detractors1 it aroused bitter passions These things have passed Look ing back from the vantageground of sixty years after we recognize that the Reform Society of Frankfort represented the extreme left of the hosts marching under the reform banner in some respects it had separated from the main army but with it all its members desired to remain within Judaism and we may write as its epitaph the closing words of its last public utterance that its aim was to make Judaism the bond which unites us without separating us from our century our fatherland and mankind DAVID PHILIPSON CINCINNATI 0 USA

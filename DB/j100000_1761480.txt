portion of the London underground railway between Aldgate station and the Mansion house by the way of the Tower The difficulties encountered from gas and water pipes sewers and foundations of buildings and the necessity of providing for the continuance of streettraffic called for in genious contrivances by means of which the construction was successfully carried forward Beton or concrete was used for the invert beton or brick for the sidewalls and brick arches covered the top All varied in thickness to suit the circumstances of the case and the superincumbent load Next follows an account of the building of a tunnel in London for the Midland railway with illustrations of the timbering employed in the work and the tunnel crosssection found best adapted to resist the pressure of the London clay A brief description of a contemplated subway under the Thames at Woolwich is then given The tunnel under the Mersey between Birk enhead and Liverpool a little less than a mile long communication between the ends of which was opened early in 1884 and the Severn tun nel not far from Bristol to be four miles and a half in length and now well advanced oc cupy in description about onehalf of this report The drainagetunnel below the main tunnel under the Mersey the arrangements for pump ing and ventilation the introduction of Col Beaumonts machine which had previously bored five thousand linear yards through chalk in the proposed tunnel under the English Chan nel and here bores a hole seven feet in diam eter through the sandstone rock  are well described The Severn tunnel is prosecuted with drills driven by compressed air Prog ress has been hindered from time to time by the influx of water even to the extent of com pletely flooding the works The pumps re quired are consequently very powerful having a capacity of eightytwo thousand six hundred cubic metres in twentyfour hours With the exception of two pages devoted to an intercepting or trunk sewer at Brighton the closing pages are devoted to an account of the examinations and investigations already made in regard to a tunnel under the English Chan nel between Dover and Calais the present state of the project and the possibilities of the scheme The book is handsomely printed and the illustrations are very clear and explicit 5NCE 101 NOTES AND NEWS IN a lecture at Johns Hopkins on the place of the science of hygiene in a liberal education Dr Billings states the objections to the establishment of such a course as follows first that there is no existing demand on the part of students for it second that the subject is not yet on a scientific basis third that the present courses of instruction given in the chemical physical and biological de partments of the university include all that a well educated man need know of this subject unless he proposes to make it a specialty fourth that the students have no time for any studies additional to the course already supplied To the first objection Dr Billings replied that the same might be said as to other branches of the curriculum  that the ma jority of students do not know what they ought to study  and that the question is whether the time has not come to create the demand and for the uni versity to lead the way in the matter The second objection is only partly true The general rule holds good in man as it does in the laboratory that like causes under like circumstances will produce like effects When it has been shown in a number of wellmarked cases that polluted water has been the means of spreading typhoidfever that overcrowding and foul air precede epidemic typhus that scarlet fever or diphtheria has been conveyed to a village by infected clothing from a distance we have enough information to enable us to advise in similar cases although we also know that men have drunk sewage with impunity and that unprotected children have slept in the same bed with a scarletfever case and have not taken the disease  The foundations under the stone piers support ing the iron bridge twentyfive feet above lowwater level by which the Wabash St Louis and Pacific railway crosses the Kankakee River have lately been giving trouble The bedrock of shale is hard and soft in places in the short space of a few feet The three piers were built when the water was high and were placed on platforms of four thicknesses of pine tim ber twelve inches square Before these platforms were located some of the loose material was removed but it would appear that the foundation was dug deepest in the centre and the rapid current of high water washed under and disturbed the piers In order to fill the space give a firm bearing over all the bottom make the piers thoroughly durabl and at the same time not interrupt or interfere with the traf fic over the bridge the application of wooden wedges was suggested and carried out by P E Falcon of Chicago By a strong jet of water and other appli ances the sediment and loose material were cleared away by divers from under two timbers at a time and the bedrock was cut away to a level Oak timbers were fitted to the cavity and a double row of broad oak wedges to insure a complete bearing from the middle of the pier to the outside edge was driven between the oak timbers and the pine platform by means of a steel bar weighing eight hundred pounds suspended from the bridge by wires and adjusted to102 SCIE strike the heads of the wedges The wedges when all in place were driven in the proper order to bring the pier back to its original position and were then fastened by iron spikes driven by a ramrod dropped through a gaspipe as a guide The work was done on the three piers by three divers in ninety days and three hundred wedges were used On an obscure passage in the Koran Mr W T Lynn late of the Royal observatory Greenwich writes as follows In reference to Sir George Airys letter in the Athenaeum suggesting that the famous passage in the fiftyfourth Sura of the Koran does not relate to any phenomenal or supposed miraculous appearance in the moon but to the ordinary semi lunar phase when she is said in the language of astronomers to be dichotomized perhaps I may quote Mr Rodwells rendering of the passage The hour hath approached and the moon hath been cleft But if the unbelievers see a miracle they turn aside and say magic that shall pass away And they treat the prophets as impostors and follow their own lusts but every thing is unalterably fixed  This hardly reads like a reference to an ordinary appearance of the moon as a chronological datum The unbelievers could surely not speak of that which occurs every fortnight as magic though many might conclude from previous experience that a peculiar appearance produced by some meteoro logical condition even though of a more remark able kind than they had seen before would pass away and had no prophetical meaning As to the expression every thing is unalterably fixed Mohammed would probably mean that even miracles took place like ordinary phenomena by divine ap pointment Mr Rodwell like Sale thinks the word translated hath been cleft may mean  will be cleft the future being expressed by the prophetic preter ite and the reference being to one of the signs of the last day Nevertheless he admits that the passage may refer to a miracle said to have been wrought by Mohammed and this is I believe the general im pression of Mohammedans with regard to it I well remember travelling many years ago to Oxford with an Egyptian who had some scientific acquaintance with astronomy and was at the time visiting the English observatories and on my remarking that Mohammed laid no claim to miraculous powers he exclaimed Oh pardon il a fait des miracles il divisa la lune en deux parties et puis  Here my companion broke off his own sentence with a hearty laugh sufficiently indicating his own scepticism of the alleged miracle He was evidently about to refer to the later accretions of the story with which I was familiar as given by Gibbon from Maracci but he gave the Koran as his authority and his primary reference was undoubtedly to the passage quoted by Sir George Airy The Swedish academy of sciences has recently published the results of the measurements of the level of the Baltic begun in 1750 to decide the con troversy on the point between Celsius and the German scientific men of his day The verdict of these hun NCE Vo V No 104 dred and thirtyfour years is that both parties were right and both were wrong The Swedish coast has been steadily rising while that along the southern fringe of the Baltic has been as steadily sinking The dividingline along which no change is perceptible passes from Sweden to the SchleswigHolstein coast over Bornholm and Laland The northern part of Sweden has risen about seven feet The rate of ele vation gradually declines as we go southward being only about one foot at the Naze and nothing at Bornholm which remains at the same level as in the middle of the last century An example will best illustrate the process The cliff near Pieta known as Stora Reppen was in 1851 ninetythree centi metres higher above the waterlevel than it was in the year 1750 and on the 12th of August 1884 it was found to be about fifty centimetres higher than in 1851 showing that the rate of elevation had been quickened during the thirty years immediately pre ceding The general average result would be that the Swedish coast has risen about a hundred and forty three centimetres nearly fiftysix inches during the last hundred and thirtyfour years  Writing to Kosimos from the Brazilian province of Rio Grande do Sul Dr H von Ihreng in regard to a case of polydactylism in a horse which came under his own observation says he has scarcely spoken to any one who has travelled much in that region who has not himself met one or more cases of the kind The extra toes are on the inner side of the forefeet The question he says forces itself upon one whether there has not been a survival of the old race of Equus in a few regions which has escaped the notice of the discoverers and early settlers of the country  The horse certainly still existed in the Rio Grande during the pleistocene era as I have re ceived horseteeth from alluvial soil which were found in digging a well and which agree in the very slight est details with the corresponding teeth of Equus Caballus It is possible that among the wild horses of South America there are still to be found descend ants of the native horses of the alluvial  Human skulls and other bones were lately dug up from the kj6kkenm6ddings at Muyem near the Tajo Portugal which judging from the character of the deposits and accompanying fauna can almost with certainty be ascribed to the quaternary epoch The earlier race was dolichocephalic To this belonged a number of skulls of wonderful uniformity offering so few differences except of a sexual character that we have unquestionably to do here with a homoge neous race The prognathism of the skulls and the lengthof the forearm such as is only met with among negroes recall at once the African races while the capacity of the cranium is so small that it can be compared only with that of the Australian There are also but few races of so small stature as these old inhabitants of Portugal Only three brachycephalic skulls were found and judging from the organic marks these belonged to a larger race than the doli chocephalic 7

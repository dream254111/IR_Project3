Immense herds of elk have passed the winter along the trav elled road from Gardiner to Cook City with the same safety which herds of domestic range cattle enjoy in other localities Several stacks of hay which had been placed along this road in anticipa tion of winter freighting were appropriated and doubtless enjoyed by these animals It is difficult to form any accurate estimate con cerning the number of elk that passed the winter in the park cer tain it is that the number that wintered in the valley of Lamar River and on its tributaries have been estimated by all who saw them at several thousands The elk are accustomed when driven out of the mountains by the snows of winter to follow down the course of the mountainstreams into the lower valleys For this reason but little efficient protection can be afforded to this species of large game in the park except upon the Yellowstone River and its tributaries  The elk which follow down the outward slopes of the moun tains surrounding the park along the tributaries of the Madison and the Gallatin on the west or the Snake River on the south pass beyond the park limits before the huntingseason permitted by the territorial laws has closed and fall an easy prey to the hunters who are in wait for them  A small number of buffalo still remain in the park but after as careful and thorough an investigation as is practicable I am un able to state their numbers with any approach to accuracy My impression is that they have been heretofore somewhat overesti mated and that at the present time they will not exceed one hundred in number They are divided into three separate herds One of these ranges between Hellroaring and Slough Creeks in summer well up on these streams in the mountains outside the park limits and in the winter lower down on small tributaries of the Yellowstone within the park If the reports made several years ago can be relied on this herd has rapidly diminished and it is doubtful if it now exceeds some twenty or thirty in number Whether or not this decrease has been due to illegal killing by hunters or to other causes I am unable to say though I do not believe that many have been killed within the past two years An other herd ranges on Specimen Mountain and the waters of Peli can Creek The herd was seen by reliable parties several times last winter and was variously estimated at from forty to eighty A traveller on the Cook City road claimed to have counted fifty four near the base of Specimen Ridge A scoutingparty which I sent out during the month of May found but twentyseven head of this herd with four young calves It is possible that the herd at this time was broken up and that but one portion of it was found The third herd ranges along the continental divide and is much scattered A band of nine or ten from this herd was seen several times this spring in the vicinity of the Upper Geyser Basin It will take close observation for several years to determine with any cer tainty the number of these animals or whether or not they are diminishing in numbers It is practically certain that none have been killed within the park limits during the past two years and yet there is an equal certainty that the present numbers do not ap proach those of past estimates  Large numbers of antelope are found in the park A herd of some two hundred passed the winter within a mile of the town of Gardiner pasturing on the plain between the Yellowstone and Gardiner Rivers south of the town They were unmolested though it was found necessary to occasionally drive them back to wards the hills that they might not get beyond the park limits The mountain sheep are found in all of the mountain ranges within the park A band of seven or eight spent a large portion of the winter in the cliffs along the travelled road between Mammoth Hot Springs and Gardiner and they became so accustomed to the sight of travellers as to manifest but little more timidity or wild ness than sheep of the domestic variety The progress of roadconstruction in the park has been greatly retarded by the lack of sufficient appropriations It is greatly to be regretted that the beauties of the park that in the words of the statute has been  set apart as a public park or pleasuringground for the benefit of the people is not rendered accessible in all its NCE VOL XI No 278 parts to the public by the construction of roads and bridges the cost of which has been estimated at 130000 It appears that the only method of enforcing the laws and regu lations regarding the park is the expulsion of all offenders there existing no court which has jurisdiction over such cases The superintendents of the park have for a number of years asked that such a court be established but so far Congress has not acted upon their suggestions It seems however on the whole that the park is well protected from injury and the steadily increasing number of visitors shows that it has not decreased in attractiveness either to Americans or to foreigners A NEW SCIENCE OF MIND THE authorities of the College de France the representative in stitution of the higher education in France have transformed as already reported in Science the chair of the law of nature and of nations  into a chair of experimental and comparative psychology The significance of this action lies in its calling the new psychol ogy to a coordinate rank with the more widely recognized and historically sanctioned sciences This honor has naturally caused considerable inquiry as to the nature and the objects of the new science and M Paul Janet the wellknown writer on ethical topics undertakes to enlighten his countrymen in this regard  Une Chair de Psychologie Experimentale et Comparee au College de France Revue de Deux Mondes April I I888 M Janet with perhaps pardonable patriotism poses the new psychology as of French origin but it is really connected with the past by many roots It is related to the objective study of mind furthered by Hartley and Locke by Descartes and Cabanis its welfare has been more essentially secured by the general renais sance of physiological and neurological studies of which the name of Johannes Mtiller is representative the modern alienists drew attention to the valuable mine of mental phenomena that disease laid bare and after it emerged as an independent study it willingly acknowledged its indebtedness to physics and physiology as well as to psychiatry and anthropology without forgetting its parentage from the psychology of the past itself the result of a progressive philosophic insight The term physiological psychology though quite generally in use to describe the new movement really expresses but one though perhaps the most important and advanced division of a scientific or as M Janet prefers an objective psychology The new psy chology however is characterized as much by its method its spirit as by its contents and it was for this reason that the chair was called one of  comparative and  experimental psychology Difficult though it is to summarize the various lines of interest that unite workers in the several specialties of the new psychology the attempt may be useful From the physiological side psychology finds that the phenomena with which it is concerned occur in con nection with a material organism of an intricate and mysterious construction The analogues of the acts which we recognize in ourselves as the indices and concomitants of psychic states are un mistakably found in the lower animals No matter how far down in the scale we descend we nowhere lose the thread that makes the world akin The tendency of modern inquiry says Mr Ty lor  is more and more towards the conclusion that if there is law anywhere it is everywhere and in the amoeba stretching out its extemporized arm in response to an irritation in its environment psychology detects a real though remote analogy to that varied and farsighted adaptation of means to ends that characterizes the life of a high civilization The problem then is to trace the successive stages of this coordination of nervous structure with psychophysi ological function to see reflex act emerging into instinct to see instinct acquiring more and more adaptability and sending the young into the world less freighted with the readymade acquisitions of their ancestors and freer to shape their lives according to out ward conditions until in the human infant nature presents at once the most helpless and the most educable of organisms This gen eral problem includes many special ones In ascending the evolu tionary scale the nervous system increases in complexity the parts become more specialized and more integrated finer methods of p SCIENCE study are needed and when we ascend to the highest product of evolution the cortex of the human cerebrum we are presented with the most interesting as well as with the most baffling aspect of the problem A combination of methods applied with patience and ingenuity has divested the problem of some of its mystery By coordinating the symptoms during life with the lesions revealed in the postmortem examination by exposing the brains of the lower animals to definite injuries and carefully recording the results by removing certain senseorgans or other parts in developing animals and observing the defects of organization in the adult by utilizing the exceptions that nature presents  we have acquired a knowl edge of the laws of the nervous system that would have seemed Utopian to our fathers and that has already enabled the surgeon to predict the location of and remove a tumor in the brain The study of the senses has acquired a deeper and a richer mean ing since the recognition of its place in a forming science has come about The revolutionary discoveries of Helmholtz whose success is so largely due to the union of two sciences have induced others to continue the work in a hundred directions and as indicative of the promise that these researches hold out may be cited the con viction of an eminent physicist Professor Mach that the next great movement in the progress of science must come from the union of psychological points of view with physical methods and results A mere mention of the many investigations that owe their origin to the work of Fechner and the formulation of his psychophysic law must suffice to indicate the great activity in this field and to justify the title of an experimental psychology Moreover the measure ments of the time taken up by various psychic processes the ex perimental study of memory of attention of the association of ideas of the bilateral functions of rhythm and the timesense of space and time perceptions and so on have led to the development of a mass of ingenious apparatus and have made the psychological lab oratory an indispensable requisite for its satisfactory instruction Morbid psychology is a rubric of paramount importance to the full and clear comprehension of the phenomena of mind The genesis of illusions and hallucinations the perversion of the natural channels of the emotions the disintegration of the elements of personality the dissolution of the logical powers all these prob lems transform the apparently wild and chaotic picture of the mad house into a sad but interesting record of the process of character and of mind building This interest is heightened by remembering that here lies the key to the understanding of the psychic epidemics that in the past have upset the rationality of mankind and trans formed the incoherent babbling of some demented soul into the mysterious utterances of a revealed spirit It is furthermore heigh tened by the notice that the phenomena conveniently grouped as  psychic research are attracting and always will attract Hypno tism after an adventurous and uncertain existence in the hands of charlatans has been admitted into science and although the literature of the topic at least in France is increasing out of all proportion to our insight into the nature of the phenomena yet enough has been established to recognize in this semimorbid con dition the key to the solution of many otherwise barely accessible problems With regard to those borderland phenomena   telep athy  clairvoyance and the like  they illustrate the subtle ness of the process by which false systems gain success and demonstrate the advisability of having men who can speak on such topics with the authority of trained experts What its votaries have deservedly dignified into the science of  anthropological psychology offers a most attractive field for re search The customs and thoughthabits of primitive peoples not only record the first stages in the progress that leads to cul ture but prevent the formulation of notions that seem true enough when tested by our own civilization but reveal the provinciality of their origin when applied to more rudimentary conditions of life Instead of resumding the many rubrics that here contribute to the completeness of a scientific psychology one may refer to the works of Mr E B Tylor as exemplifying at once the attractiveness of the subject and the value of the results under a learned and skil ful treatment If we conclude this survey with the mention of the psychology of the developing child glimpsing as it does in the budding capabil ities of the infant the microcosm of the race and an epitome of the 257 struggle for civilization it is not because the lines of research have been exhausted but that with the scope of the science thus outlined what remains to be done will probably be suggested by what has been said The psychology of the infant is not the only point at which psychology and education touch but everywhere education must refer to psychology of which in the highest sense it is only the practical application The movement has not been without its opponents The cry has been raised that it is not a science but a mere aggregation of disjointed facts  it shines by borrowed wealth But the force of this objection is weakened if we remember that a science maintains its individuality quite as mnuch by the point of view from which it regards its subjectmatter as from the nature of the subjectmatter itself It is not an evidence of weakness for one science to borrow from and build upon another but it testifies to the unity of the phenomena of nature and reduces the division of the sciences to what they at bottom represent  the classification of the direction of mens interests The chaotic condition of the facts with which psychology deals is rapidly disappearing and it may yet hope to receive a unifying impulse such as Darwinism gave to zoology It is at all events better to have a collection to arrange when the true method of arrangement shall be discovered than not to col lect because the ideal arrangement is not yet at our service Again there are some who heedless of the caution of George Henry Lewes  that the first question is not  What does it lead to   but  Is it true   see in the objective study of mind the downfall of idealism and of all the valuable beliefs that have clustered about it They stigmatize it as materialistic This is surely a misunderstanding The history of the movement does not bear out such an accusation The men the spirit of whose work is in line with a scientific psychology  Lotze Helmholtz Fechner Wundt are all of them the very opposite of materialists The new movement does not attempt to usurp the place held by other studies except as it is an advance upon them it does not pose as the only department of philosophic learning Its profes sors have fortunately been men of liberal sympathies and deeply imbued with the historical sense They do not claim to have created a science entirely new unique and undreamt of but appreciate their development from the past Their aim is to retain for the study of mental science that high place which has always beenr accorded it by making it progressive and abreast of modern learning Professor Ribot in the opening lecture of his course at the Col lege de France Revue Scientzfique April i4 taking a birdseye view of psychological activity in the various countries of civilization saw everywhere signs of great promise The literature is increas ing both in value and in quantity The science has reached the monograph stage Journals specially devoted to its interests such as the Philosof5hische Studzen the Revue Philosof5hique the Rzvisla di Filosofia Scientfica and our own American 5ournal of Psychology are flourishing and laboratories and professorships for the dissemination of its teaching are being established at the leading universities With the advantages that the youth and plasticity of our educational institutions give them and the success ful examples of the leading universities before them with the practical ends that the new movement embraces and with our pushing enthusiasm to have every thing that is new and good  it seems justifiable to predict for scientific psychology a large and representative following in this country JOSEPH JASTROW ABORIGINAL ARCHITECTURE IN THE SOUTHWEST A FIELDPARTY of the Bureau of Ethnology in charge of Mr Victor Mindeleff has recently returned to Washington bringing a large amount of new and valuable material For a number of years past Mr Mindeleffs investigations have been confined to the architecture of the Southwest One of the most interesting places visited by him during the past season was a group of cavedwell ings situated about eight miles northeast of Flagstaff Arizona These ruins had previously been visited by Major Powell and Mr Stevenson The remains occupy the summit of a cinder cone and extend some distance down the south side The rooms are numerous JUNE I 1888

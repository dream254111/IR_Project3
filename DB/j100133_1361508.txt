maples and alders form a thicket in the creek bottom For several years we have watched a pair of grosbeaks that spent their summer in a little tlicket alrong Fulton Creek I hiave no doubt the same pair lC s returred to thIe 01t nesting place for the last tliree or four years It seems I can almo st recognize the notes of their song If our ears were only tuned to the music of the birds could we not recognize themn as we recognize our old friends Last year I founid three spotted eggs ill a looselymniade nest that was placed in the dogwood This year the site was scarcely twenty feet from the old home They came nearer the ground andI placed the thin framework of their honme be146 THE CONDOR VOL VI tween the two upright forks of an arrowwood bush We had never bothered them very much with the camera but when they put their home right down within four feet and a half of the ground it looked to me as if they wanted some pictures taken It was too good a chance for us to miss When I waded through the ferns and pressed aside the bushes the nest was full to the brim Above the rim I could see the white fluff wavering in a breath of air I stole up and looked in Ihe three bantlings were sound asleep Neither parent happened to be near I crawled back and hid well down in the bushes twelve feet away Thefather came in as silent as a shadow and rested on the nests edge He was a beauty He had a shiny black head black wings crossed with bars of white and the rich redbrown of his breast shaded into lemonyellow toward the tail He crammed something in each wide open mouth The mother was right at his heels She treated each bobbing head in the same way Then i  I i P1 pa rrF MALE GROSBEAK ABOUT TO FEED YOUNG with head cocked on the side she looked each youngster over turning him gently with her head The weather was warm and it seemed to me the young grosbeaks grew almost fast enough to rival a toadstool Sunshine makes a big difference These little fellows got plenty to eat and were where the sun filtered through the leaves and kept them warm The young thrushes across the gully were in a dark spot They got as much food but they rarely got a glint of the sun They didnt grow as much in a week as the grosbeak babies did in three days I liked to sit and watch the brilliant male He perched on the top branches of the fir and stretched his wings till you could see their lemon lining He preened his tail to show the hidden spots of white What roundelays he whistled Whitteo Whitteo Reet Early in the morning he showed the quality of his singing Later in the day it often lost

the atmosphere was too lazy to call for perfect execution The morning of July sixth the three young birds left the nest following their parents out into the limbs of the surrounding bushes They were not able to fly more than a few feet but they knew how to perch and call for food I never heard a more enticing dinner song It was such a sweet musical touralee The parents fed their bantlings as much on berries as on worms and insects Once I saw the father distribute a whole mouthful of green measuring worms The next time he had visited a garden down the hillside for he brought one raspberry in his bill and coughed up three more Both birds soon got over their mad anxiety every time we looked at the youngsters In fact they soon seemed willing enough FEMALE GROSBEAK AT NEST to have the birdlings share the bits from our own lunch We spent the next two days watching and photographing It took all the next morning however to find the three bantlings The mother had enticed one down the creek to some hazel bushes I watched her for two hours before I heard the soft whistle of the youngster He perched on my finger and I brought him back to the nest Another was found down in the thimbleberry bushes This one with the third up in the maple saplings over the nest seemed to be in the keeping of the father After watching them all day we put them in a little isolated clump of bushes late in the afternoon and when we went early the next morning they were still there but perched well up on the top limbs The parents had become quite tame and paid little attention either to the camera or to us By the fourth day how148 THE CONDOR VoL VI ever the young grosbeaks were beyond the reach of the camera Theirwings had developed strength and they were beginning to hunt for

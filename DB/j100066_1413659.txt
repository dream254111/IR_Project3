j100066,The American Journal of Psychology,1413659,An Anomalous Case of Simple Reaction,i261683,AN ANOMALOUS CASE OF SIMPLE REACTION By E B TITCHENER In their study of the effect of auditory distraction upon the sensory reaction Cassel and Dallenbach mention an ob server L who proved unable under the instructions given for the practiceseries to maintain the required constancy of at titude1 Ls average for 100 sensory reactions taken near the beginning of the period of practice is 29729  5946 T and her average for another 100 after more than 1500 have been taken is 28447  4327 It is plain that the m v is too large It is plain also however that the times themselves are exceptional They might serve as typical of sensory reaction to light they are too long for sensory reaction to sound Since anomalous cases are often instructive I thought it worth while to put the observer to a further test L gener ously consented to sacrifice her spring vacation for the pur pose and Dr Josephine Gleason instructor in the department of psychology was good enough to reassemble the apparatus and controls used by Cassel and Dallenbach and to serve as experimenter Since Ls vacation did not fall at the same time as our ownspring vacations are the freelances of the academic calendarwe were unable to carry out our entire plan in particular we were unable to take reactiontimes in other sensedepartments With two exceptions the experimental arrangements were identical with those of Cassel and Dallenbach 1 We did not give our instructions for the three forms of simple reaction sensory natural motor by word of mouth but typewrote the formulas 2 and laid them without comment or discussion before the observer We hoped in this way to further con stancy of attitude 2 The preparatory signals which in the original experiment lasted nearly threequarters of a second3 were at the observers request cut down to bare flashes of light The various series were distributed as fairly as possible over the hours at our disposal We began with a preliminary series of 82 sensory reactions the result was 29897  5673 a 1 This JOURNAL xxix 1918 131 f 2 See my Textbook of Psychology I9IO 436

regular timeorder the sensory times are longest the motor times shortest 2 The difference between sensory and motor reaction is 7080 or 3 The m v of the natural and motor times is onetenth or less of the times themselves 4 The stabilising effect of practice appears in the lessened variation of the three final series4 We note on the other hand 5 that the m v of the sensory reactionalthough it is relatively smaller than that quoted for their concluding series by Cassel and Dallenbach and al though in our own final series it seems to be approaching the normis in the average too high It is useless to guess what further experiments would have revealed the pity is that we had no time to make them We can say only that if the effect of practice had been continued another 200 or 300 experiments would have brought the m v down to the required onetenth of the total reactiontime We note also 6 that the total times are all very nmuch too high This point needs fuller discussionand its discussion we may premise will force us to reject some of our previous conclusions regarding the nor mality of Ls results Let us first of all take Ls testimony as to her understand ing of the instructions In the case of the motor reaction she reports  I was quite cautious not to react before I heard the particular sound That had happened in the previous experi ment of Cassel and Dallenbach and I had been warned against premature reaction I  identified the stimulus and I am positive that I should not have gone off to any other sound Again  in the sensory reaction I was more careful 4 I attribute this decrease of the m v to practice because it appears in the successive series of the sensory and motor though not in those of the natural reactions If there was any increase of atten tion due to Ls pulling herself together for the final seriesand we have no evidence that there wasit was probably offset by fatigue 63TITCHENER than ever I waited to be really conscious of the stimulus I waited with the intent to hear the sound and klnow it That process seemed to be a hearing of the sound and then a saying to myself This is the sound react Tlhcii I reacted There can be little doubt therefore that Ls  motor reaction is essentially a sensory reaction and the tines agree since the norm of sensory reaction to sound is some 225c There can be little doubt either that Ls  sensory reaction is essentially a cognitive reaction Here we have no means of direct com parison of times But my own experiments upon the visual cognitive reaction to colors short words and letters gave times ranging from 290 to 320 o with m v of 24 to 39 a5 It is true that there is a difference of sensedepartment and it is true that L was not reacting under the external conditions of the experiment upon cognitive reaction I think neverthe less that the agreement is as close as could have been expected So far then everything seems clear Yet the question of attitude remains How does it come about that L reacts in the sensory attitude to motor instructions and in the cognitive attitude to sensory instructions Moreover the times of her natural reaction are to be considered In the natural reaction she says  I more or less let myself go I did not hold myself in tension and reacted as the sound came to me without any particular effort either to react quickly or to be careful con cerning the identification of the stimulus as such Yet the times lie between sensory and cognitive times not between motor and sensory Here we may be in presence of a constitutional factor L remarks  I am extremely slow in games and have never been proficient in any It seems sometimes as if there were a defi nite effort necessary to connect the impulse to move with the action Of course this does not occur always but it is very noticeable when I am trying to give my best attention to learn a game or a difficult gymnasium exercise I can always remember it even when I played games down at the district school She says further I am naturally slow to react to auditory stimuli In everyday experience I have always found it easier to get an idea by visual means than by auditory that is I can get an idea more quickly from reading than from hearing the same thing in a lecture I read faster than most people It is again a pity that we had no time to take reactions to visual stimuli Evidently the situation will not become transparent until such experiments are made 5 Zur Chronometrie des Erkennungsactes Philos Studien viii I893 14I ff 64AN ANOMALOUS CASE OF SIMPLE REACTION Meantime we may interpret our results as follows L was called upon by Cassel and Dallenbach to give sensory reactions to sound The experiment was unfamiliar and difficult and L desired as she puts it to prove herself steady She accord ingly took the instructions for the sensory reaction as if they had been instructions for a cognitive reaction Since how ever this mode of reaction was neither favoured by the ex ternal conditions of the experiment nor circumscribed by fit ting instructions her m v was unduly large When she came to us she was oppressed by the thought of the dreadful results of last spring and aware that she was to undergo a further test We began perhaps unfortunately with a practiceseries of sensory reactions and L carried over to them the attitude which she had taken with Cassel and Dallenbach She speaks of a  habit of reaction so fixed that each reaction is not separate but rather a following of a fixed course of action  I felt as if I had reacted so many times in a certain way that I had really formed a habit of reaction This  habit is also responsible for the long times of the natural reaction which meant for L simply a slight letting down from the deliberate selfcontrol of the sensory cog nitive reaction The demands of the motor instruction  react as soon as you hear it react as quickly as possible  produced a change of attitude and lowered the times of reac tion by the 7080 cr which we noted above but the change covered only the single step from cognitive to sensory and not the two steps from cognitive to motor reaction Whether L is constitutionally incapable of motor reaction to sound or whether after practice with visual reactions she would be competent to this form of response cannot be said She herself believes that she is naturally a slow reactor but the belief might prove to be rooted in some accident of her early experience I hope that we may be able later on ta resume the study of her case 65

J101009,THE VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER,1099142,EVIDENCE CIVIL CASE TESTIMONY ON FORMER TRIAL OF WITNESS ABSENT FROM STATE,I245881,802 6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER MARCH CORRESPONDENOE EVIDENCECIVIL CASETESTIMONY ON FORMER TRIAL OF WITNESS ABSENT FROM STATE EDITOR VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER THERE WAS A QUESTION OF SOME NOVELTY RAISED HERE IN OUR CIRCUIT COURT WHICH MAY BE OF INTEREST TO READERS OF THE REGISTER THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE THESE AT THE JUNE TERM OF THE COURT A WITNESS TESTIFIED FOR THE PLAINTIFF AND WAS WHEN ON THE STAND EXAMINED AND CROSSEXAMINED THIS TRIAL RESULTED IN A HUNG JURY AT THE NEXT CALLING OF THE CASE THIS WITNESS WAS SHOWN TO HAVE LEFT THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT SOON AFTER THE FIRST TRIAL AND HAD NOT SINCE HIS DEPARTURE AND WAS NOT THEN AMENABLE TO ITS PROCESS ALSO THAT HE COULD NOT BE LOCATED WHILE SO AWAY THOUGH DILIGENT EFFORTS HAD BEEN MADE TO DO SO THROUGH NO FAULT OF THE PLAINTIFF THE WITNESS COULD NOT BE PRODUCED NOR HIS DEPOSITION TAKEN IT WAS THEN PROPOSED TO SHOW WHAT THIS WITNESS FORMERLY TESTIFIED STRENUOUS OBJECTION WAS MADE TO THIS AND THE FOLLOWING QUESTION THERE FORE RAISED IF A WITNESS AT A PREVIOUS TRIAL BETWEEN THE SAME PARTIES WAS SWORN AND THERE WAS OPPORTUNITY TO CROSSEXAMINE HAS SINCE LEFT THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT AND AFTER DILIGENT SEARCH CANNOT BE FOUND MAY AT A SUBSEQUENT TRIAL OF THE SAME CAUSE THE TESTIMONY OF SUCH WITNESS BE GIVEN IN EVIDENCE BY PARTIES PRESENT WHO HEARD HIM TESTIFY  HAD THE WITNESS DIED AFTER THE FIRST TRIAL AND BEFORE THE SECOND THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT HIS PREVIOUS TESTIMONY COULD BE SO PROVED LEES ADMR V HILL 87 VA 497 RUCK V ROCK ISLAND 97 U S 693 CARRICO V WEST VA CENTRAL  P R CO 24 L R A 50 CATON V LENOX 5 RAND 36 15 AM  ENG ENCY OF LAW 2D ED 316 11 IDEM 524 1 GREENLEAFS EV SEC 163 4 MINORS INST 871 AND NUMEROUS AUTHORITIES BUT COULD THIS BE DONE WHERE THE WITNESS WAS SIMPLY ABSENT FROM THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT AND COULD NOT BE FOUND THERE IS NO REAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO CASES NEITHER CAN BE REACHED BY THE COURT OR THE PARTIES THE PRINCIPLE OR HARDSHIP IS THE SAME CRARY V SPRAGUE 12 WEND N Y 46 THE WEIGHT OF AUTHORITY IN THIS COUNTRY AND ENGLAND HOLDS SUCH EVIDENCE ADMISSIBLE IN EITHER CASE THERE IS NO DIRECT AUTHORITY ON THE SUBJECT IN VIRGINIA BUT TEXT WRITERS GENERALLY SAY SUCH EVIDENCE IS NOT ADMISSIBLE IN VIRGINIA IN 1 GREEN LEAFS EV SEC 163 15 ED  IN THE FOOT NOTE IT IS SAID THAT THE FACT THAT THE WITNESS IS OUT OF THE STATE EVEN IN CIVIL CASES DOES NOT AUTHORIZE THE ADMISSION OF SUCH EVIDENCE IN VIRGINIA CITING BROGYS CASE 10 GRATT 722 I DO NOT THINK THIS CASE IS AN AUTHORITY AGAINST THE ADMISSION OF SUCH EVIDENCE AND THAT HERE IN A CIVIL CASE SUCH EVIDENCE IS ADMISSIBLE BROGYS CASE WAS DECIDED UPON THE AUTHORITY OF FINNS CASE 5 RAND 701 WHICH LATTER CASE IS A LEADING ONE ON THE SUBJECT IN VIRGINIA BOTH OF THESE WERE CRIMINAL CASES JUDGE BROKENBROUGH THOUGH NOT CALLED UPON TO DO SO PROCEEDS TO STATE THE LAW ON THE SUBJECT BOTH IN CRIMINAL AND CIVIL CASES THE WITNESS CHANDLER IN THAT CASE HAD  REMOVED FROM THE COMMONWEALTH  WHETHER HE COULD NOT BE FOUND AND HIS DEPOSITION TAKEN DOES NOT APPEAR IN THE COURSE OF A LEARNED OPINION THIS JUDGE AFTER SAYING THAT IN A CIVIL CASE IF A WITNESS WHO HAS BEEN1901 CORRESPONDENCE 803 EXAMINED IN A FORMER TRIAL ETC IS SINCE DEAD WHAT HE SWORE TO ON THE FORMER TRIAL MAY BE GIVEN IN EVIDENCE  FOR THE EVIDENCE WAS GIVEN UNDER OATH  AND THE PARTY HAD OPPORTUNITY OF CROSSEXAMINING HIM DECIDES  BUT WE CANNOT FIND THAT THE RULE HAS EVER BEEN ALLOWED IN A CRIMINAL CASE INDEED IT IS SAID TO BE EXPRESSLY OTHERWISE THIS DISPOSED OF THE POINT BEFORE HIM BUT HE ADDS  NOR CAN WE FIND THE RULE IN CIVIL CASES EXTENDS TO THE ADMISSION OF THE EVIDENCE FORMERLY GIVEN BY A WITNESS WHO HAS REMOVED BEYOND THE JURISDICTION OF THE COUNTRY THIS IS THE DICTUM UPON WHICH THE EVIDENCE IS SAID TO BE EXCLUDED IN VIRGINIA I BELIEVE THAT ALL THE JUDGE HERE MEANT TO SAY WAS THAT THE MERE FACT THAT THE WITNESS IS OUT OF THE COUNTRY DOES NOT PERMIT THIS EVIDENCE FOR IT MAY BE THAT HIS DEPOSITION CAN BE TAKEN AND THIS IS A CORRECT STATEMENT IF THE DEPOSITION OF THE WITNESS CAN BE OBTAINED THE REASON FOR THE ADMISSION OF THE EVIDENCE IS WANTING THE SAME REASONS WHICH HAD JUST BEEN GIVEN FOR THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE EVIDENCE IN CASE WITNESS BE DEAD COULD BE CITED FOR THE SAME PURPOSE IF HE IS OUT OF THE COUNTRY AND CANNOT BE FOUND AT THE FORMER TRIAL EVERY SAFEGUARD WAS THROWN AROUND THE ADMISSION OF THE EVIDENCE THE GREAT AND ORDINARY TEST OF TRUTH IS NOT WANTING THE TESTIMONY WAS GIVEN UNDER OATH IN A JUDICIAL PRO CEEDING IN WHICH THE ADVERSE LITIGANT WAS A PARTY AND WHERE HE HAD POWER TO CROSSEXAMINE THE WITNESS OFFERED TO PROVE THIS FORMER TESTIMONY HAS THE SAME SAFEGUARDS AROUND HIS EVIDENCE ALL THAT THE LAW REQUIRES IS HAD IN EACH CASE IN 1 GREENLEAFS EV 16TH ED SEC 163 AND BURR W JONES ON EV SEC 345 THIS SUBJECT IS FULLY TREATED AND SUCH EVIDENCE HELD TO BE ADMISSIBLE IT IS TRUE IT IS NOT THE BEST EVIDENCE IT IS THE BEST IN THE POWER OF THE PARTY OFFERING IT HOWEVER AND THIS IS ALL GENERALLY DEMANDED  IT SHOULD APPEAR THERE IS NO BETTER EVIDENCE BEHIND AND IN THE POWER OF THE PARTY TO PRODUCE CLAIBORNE V PARRISH 2 WASH 143 BEFORE SECONDARY EVIDENCE IS ADMITTED THIS DOES FULLY APPEAR IN MANY INSTANCES THE BEST EVIDENCE IS NOT OBTAINABLE AND SECONDARY EVIDENCE RECEIVED AND THIS IS TRUE IN VIRGINIA AS ELSEWHERE AS IN CASE OF A LOST DEED ETC IN THE CASE OF JACKSON V BAILEY 2 JOHNS N Y 20 THE COURT IN SPEAKING OF THE ADMISSIBILITY OF SUCH EVIDENCE IN CASE OF THE DEATH OF THE WITNESS GIVES REASONS FOR ITS ADMISSION WHICH EQUALLY APPLY WHERE THE WITNESS IS ABSENT WHAT A DECEASED WITNESS TESTIFIED ON A FORMER TRIAL IS ONLY TO BE ASCERTAINED BY THE TESTI MONY OF SOME PERSON PRESENT WHO KNOWS AND CAN REMEMBER HIS EVIDENCE NO RECORD IS KEPT OF WHAT WITNESSES SWEAR IN COURTS OF LAW THIS SPECIES OF EVIDENCE IS ADMITTED EX NECESSITATE AND MUST BE LEFT TO THE SOUND DISCRETION OF THE JURY UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE COURT TO GIVE IT SUCH WEIGHT AS IT MERITS THE TESTI MONY OF AN ABSENT WITNESS WHO CANNOT BE LOCATED CAN BE PROVED ONLY IN THE SAME WAY THE TRUE RULE SEEMS TO BE THAT IN ALL CASES WHERE THE PARTY HAS WITHOUT HIS OWN FAULT OR CONCURRENCE IRRECOVERABLY LOST THE POWER OF PRODUCING THE WITNESS AGAIN HE SHOULD BE EXCUSED FROM SO DOING IF THERE IS AT HAND HIS TESTIMONY ALREADY SURROUNDED BY ALL THE ORDINARY TESTS OF TRUTH THIS SPECIES OF EVIDENCE IS EXCLUDED IN CRIMINAL CASES BECAUSE THE CONSTITUTION PROVIDES THAT IN EVERY CRIMINAL CASE THE ACCUSED SHALL BE CONFRONTED WITH THE WITNESSES AGAINST HIM AND HENCE THIS EVIDENCE IS NOT SUFFICIENT THOUGH MANY STATES ADMIT IT IN CRIMINAL CASES THE CIRCUIT COURT HERE ADMITTED THE EVIDENCE THE CASE WAS FINALLY DISPOSED OF IN THAT COURT AND THE COURT OF APPEALS WILL NOT BE GIVEN A CHANCE TO PASS ON THE804 6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER MARCH QUESTION AND THE DICTUM IN FINNS CASE MAY NEVER BE REVIEWED BY OUR HIGHER COURT AND TEXT WRITERS WILL CONTINUE TO PUT VIRGINIA IN A CLASS BY HERSELF ON THIS QUESTION FURTHER A WITNESS IN SUCH CASE NEED ONLY STATE THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT WAS TESTI FIED BY THE ABSENT WITNESS CATON V LENOX SUPRA THE RULE HAS BEEN STATED OTHERWISE AND THE WITNESS UNLESS HE COULD GIVE THE EXACT WORDS OF THE ABSENT WITNESS WAS DISQUALIFIED WARREN V NICHOLS 6 METE 261 IS ONE OF THESE EXTREME CASES IN RUCK V ROCK ISLAND SUPRA THE COURT SAYS THAT  IF A WITNESS FROM MERE MEMORY PROFESSES TO BE ABLE TO GIVE THE EXACT LANGUAGE IT IS REASON FOR DOUBTING HIS GOOD FAITH AND VERACITY A WITNESS MAY ALSO REFRESH HIS MEMORY FROM NOTES MADE BY HIM AT THE PREVIOUS TRIAL C A ASHBY NEWPORT NEWS VA PROCEEDINGS BY INTERROGATORIES AGAINST EXECUTION DEBTORS EDITOR VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER I HAVE HAD MY ATTENTION CALLED RECENTLY TO A SUBJECT UPON WHICH YOUR VIEWS IN THE REGISTER WOULD BE MUCH APPRECIATED BY THE BAR BY THE ACTS OF 189798 P 503 POLLARDS SUP P 368 SECTION 3603 OF THE CODE OF 1887 TOUCHING PRO CEEDINGS BY INTERROGATORIES TO ASCERTAIN THE ESTATE OF A DEBTOR ON WHICH A FI FA IS A LIEN ETC IS AMENDED ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE OLD AND THE NEW ACTS IS THAT IT IS NOW NECESSARY TO PROCURE THE FIRST SUMMONS TO THE EXECUTION DEBTOR FROM THE JUDGE OF THE COURT OF RECORD FROM WHICH THE EXECUTION ISSUEDA STEP ENTIRELY UNNECES SARY AND PUTTING THE PLAINTIFF TO THE TROUBLE OF HUNTING UP THE JUDGE WHEREVER HE MAY BE IN HIS CIRCUIT INSTEAD OF OBTAINING THE SUMMONS FROM THE COMMISSIONER AS FORMERLY IN THE COUNTRY THE JUDGECHASE WOULD AT TIMES EQUAL IN SERIOUSNESS THE DEBTORCHASE IT WOULD SEEM ALSO THAT SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEEDINGS ARE NOW NO LONGER TO BE HAD UPON EXECUTIONS ISSUED BY AND CONTROL OF WHICH IS RETAINED BY A JUSTICE OF THE PEACE BECAUSE THE NEW ACT LIMITS THE RIGHT TO ISSUE THE SUMMONS TO THE JUDGE OF ANY COURT OF RECORD FROM WHICH THE FI FA ISSUED NEVERTHELESS COMPARE SEC 3605 UNAMENDED     OR IF THE JUDGMENT BE OF A JUSTICE TO THE COURT  OF HIS COUNTY OR CORPORATION THE ACT OF FEBRUARY 14 1900 CHAP TER 352 ACTS 18991900 GIVING COUNTY COURTS JURISDICTION IN SCIRE FACIAS PROCEED INGS OR MOTIONS TO REVIVE JUDGMENTS OF JUSTICES DOES NOT SEEM TO AFFECT THE QUES TION THIS HOWEVER IN ANY VIEW OF THE CASE IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ANOTHER MATERIAL DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE FORMER STATUTE AUTHORIZED THE COMMIS SIONER IN THE EVENT OF A FAILURE OF DEBTOR TO FILE ANSWERS UPON OATH TO ISSUE AN ATTACHMENT AGAINST THE DEBTOR UNDER THE AMENDMENT HOWEVER HE MAY ONLY BY RULE RETURNABLE TO A FUTURE DAY OR IT IS TRUE FORTHWITH REQUIRE THE DEBTOR TO SHOW CAUSE WHY AN ATTACHMENT SHOULD NOT ISSUE AGAINST HIM STILL THERE IS NO PROVISION AS TO WHO IS TO ISSUE THE ATTACHMENT IN SUCH CASETHE COMMISSIONER THE COURT THE JUDGE IN VACATION OR THE CLERK YET EVERY STEP OF THE PROCEEDING SHOULD BE MADE CLEAR AND PLACED BEYOND DOUBT COURTS ARE CHARY ABOUT ARRESTING THE CITIZEN UPON IMPLIED AUTHORITY AND DO NOT ALWAYS INCLINE TO THE EVIDENT INTENDMENT OF THE

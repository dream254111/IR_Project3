to the sound discretion of the court and the appellate court will presume that this discretion was properly exercised unless the contrary is shown 2 ATTACHMENTAffidavit Affidavits as to the grounds of attachment are al ways to be strictly construed and any omission of the requirements of the statute is fatal to the attachment but if the language of the affidavit neces sarily implies the fact it is sufficient Hence an affidavit that the claim is just and that the defendant is converting c is a sufficient compliance with a statute which requires an affidavit that the claim is believed to be just and that to the best of affians belief defendant is converting c 3 ATTACHMENTTemporary removal of goods out of State in course of trade The shipment of products of an enterprise out of the State in the due course of trade where the removal is not permanent and the proceeds are brought back within the state is not sufficient ground for an attachment The statute does not mean to designate as cause

CARDWELL J delivered the opinion of the court The stockholders of the Clinch River Mineral Company a corpora tion duly chartered under the laws of Virginia engaged in the mining and manufacture of baryta and in other business connected therewith desiring to sell their property and wind up their affairs at a meeting held on the 7th day of March 1893 passed a resolution appointing Joseph Harrison and N J Floyd a committee to sell the property of the corporation and settle up its business and particularly setting forth that the committee was to sell certain property to one D I Bachman and his associates at a stipulated price which action of the stockholders was ratified and approved by the then board of directors of the company Pursuant to this resolution Harrison and Floyd as a committee did sell to Bachman and his associates certain property consisting of the leaseholds owned by the corporation together with baryta mills bleaching and drying factory c situated at or near Gardner in the county of Russell at the price of 1800000 one third of which 600000 to be paid in cash which was paid 500000 to be paid in six months 500000 in twelve months and the remainder 200000 in eighteen months from the 1st day of April 1893 it being further agreed that the property should be sold and bought by a transfer of the certificates of the stock of the com pany and that the deferred payments should be secured by a deed of trust upon all the property acquired by the purchaser except the manufactured baryta and the live stock Accordingly all of the cap ital stock of the company was transferred and assigned to Bachman and his associates and they accepted the same and proceeded to organ ize under the charter thus transferred by the election of D I Bach man as president and one M Fackenthal as secretary and other proper officers and the Clinch River Mineral Company thus reorganized executed to Harrison and Floyd committee as aforesaid the three notes of the company for the deferred payments as above set forth and after being properly authorized by its board of directors the company on the 14th day of August 1893 executed to A P Gilles 38 May1895 CLINCH RIVER MINERAL CO V HARRISON pie trustee a deed conveying certain leaseholds for the purpose of mining baryta on real estate situated in the county of Russell Vir ginia set out in the deed to secure the payment of the three notes dated April 1 1893 Harrison and Floyd committee also sold to the Clinch River Mineral Company as reorganized certain other property including a lot of crude baryta all of which was paid for except the crude baryta and for this the company was to pay 129852 on the 1st day of July 1893 but defaulted in the payment and when the first of the notes for 500000 secured by the deed to Gillespie trustee dated April 1st 1893 fell due on October 4th 1893 the company defaulted in its payment also and the note was protested whereupon Harrison and Floyd committee filed their bill of com plaint sworn to by Harrison in the clerks office of Russell Circuit Court against the Clinch River Mineral Company charging among other things that the  affairs of the company were being so managed as to involve the company in debt for the purpose of avoiding its liabilities that various liens by judgment and attachment had been acquired on the property of the company rendering it improper for the trustee in the deed of trust securing complainants to sell the prop erty before an account had been taken showing priority of liens that the company had on hand a considerable quantity of manufactured baryta which complainants believed would be shipped out of the state and converted into money that the company had on hand a con siderable stock of general merchandise which it was also converting into money with intent to hinder delay and defraud complainants and other creditors of the company that complainants had sued out of the clerks office of Russell Circuit Court an attachment which had been duly levied on the goods and other estate of the company for the amount already due to complainants and the prayer of the bill was for an account of liens upon the property conveyed in the trust deed the enforcement of the lien acquired by the attachment for an in junction to restrain the company from collecting debts due to it the appointment of a receiver the execution of the trust deed under order of the court and for general relief The affidavit of Joseph Harrison upon which the attachment issued after setting out the aggregate debt due to complainants from the defendant company says  That the claim asserted is just that complainant ought to recover of defendant in the suit the sum claimed at the least with interest that the defendant is removing and intends to remove its own estate 39VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER or the proceeds of the sale of its property or a material part of such estate or proceeds out of this State so that process of execution on a judgment when obtained in said suit will be unavailing and that de fendant is converting or about to convert and has converted its prop erty of whatever kind or some part thereof into money securities or evidences of debt with intent to hinder delay and defraud its creditors The order to the sheriff to attach the property of the defendant company was indorsed on the writ that issued on the bill and made re turnable to rules to be held in the clerks office on the last Monday in October 1893 An injunction was granted according to the prayer of the bill Oc tober 21 1893 and upon due notice being given to the defendant company complainants moved the Circuit Court of Russell county in term November 16 1893 for the appointment of a receiver and for an order of sale upon the attachment issued in the cause and thereupon the defendant company by counsel moved the court to dismiss the proceedings on the ground that no sufficient bonds had been executed as a condition for the issuing of the injunction and at tachment but the court overruled this motion appointed a receiver and directed sale of the live stock c On the 8th day of February 1894 a motion was made by complainants before the Judge of the Circuit Court of Russell County in vacation for an order of account and the defendant company appeared by its counsel and agreed that the account might be ordered which was done Later the defendant company by petition filed in the cause united in the prayer of a petition filed by the receiver for the enlargement of receivers powers but these petitions were not acted on until the hear ing The commissioner to whom the cause was referred for an account filed his report and supplemental report to which the defendant com pany excepted because the commissioner recognized the debt of 129852 as a lien on defendant companys property by reason of the attachment and because certain other accounts are treated and re ported as liens The defendant company did not however file its answer in the cause till the regular term of the court March 14 1894 when the answer was filed and asked to be treated as a crossbill which was done Whereupon complainants filed their answer to the crossbill together with certain affidavits and the Circuit Court overruled the motion of the defendant company for a continuance and overruled its 40 May1895 CLINCH RIVER MINERAL CO V HARRISON exception to the commissioners report relating to the lien of the at tachment but sustained it so far as it related to the other accounts re ported as liens and recognized these accounts as simple debts only The report of the commissioner in other respects being unexcepted to was confirmed and the decree of the court on the main question was as follows  The court is of opinion that the affidavit on which the attachment was issued is sufficient and the court is further of opinion that the fact sufficiently appears from the defendants answer that it was re moving its property out of the State so that any execution obtainable at law by the plaintiffs would not be available and therefore it is ad judged ordered and decreed that the motion to quash said attachment be overruled From this decree an appeal to this court was allowed and a super sedeas awarded These are the assignments of error made in the ap pellants petition for the appeal First That the affidavit upon which the attachment issued is in sufficient because it does not state that the claim is believed to be just as the statute requires and further that it does not state the ex istence to the best of affiants belief that the defendant is convert ing or is about to convert etc Second That if it be granted that the affidavit is sufficient then still it was incumbent upon the complainants to prove the truth of the allegations of said attachment that is first that the defendant was moving its effects out of the Commonwealth second that it was con verting or disposing of its effects with intent to defraud its creditors and as the allegations were not proven the court should have quashed the attachment Third That the attachment should have been quashed for the reason that it was made returnable to Rule day and not to the term And it is contended by the appellant in the petition and at bar that the Circuit Court erred in overruling its motion for a continuance and in hearing the cause at the March term 1894 A motion for a continuance is addressed always to the sound discre tion of the court and the appellate court will always presume that the court properly exercised that discretion unless the contrary be shown The facts disclosing any impropriety in the ruling of the court below on this motion are not in this record and for us what does not so appear does not exist As to the first ground stated why the attachment should have been 41VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER quashed it will be noted that the affidavit states that the claim is just and that the defendant is converting c while the lan guage of the statute in the one instance is that the claim is believed to be just and in the other that to the best of affiants belief de fendant is converting c It is true that the affidavit is always to be strictly construed and any omission of the requirements of the law is fatal to the attachment but if the language of the affidavit necessarily implies the fact it is sufficient Bartons Chancery Practice Vol 1 p 585 In this case the affidavit of Harrison leaves nothing to be implied but states the facts In the case of Jones v Leake 11 Smedes  Marshall 591 where the statute of Mississippi required that the affidavit should show that the facts sworn to were within the personal knowledge of the affiant or that he had been informed or believed them to be true the affidavit sets out that defendant is indebted to affiant in a sum certain and that he is about concealing his property so as to defeat the affiants claim and the High Court of Errors and Appeals of Mississippi held this to be sufficient Mr Justice Thacker in delivering the opinion of the court said In these particulars there is the oath of the plain tiff plainly made to the facts They do not purport to have been sworn to upon the information of others but carry clearly the pre sumption that they were within the personal knowledge of the affiant As they are stated upon the oath of the plaintiff it is but a fair con struction that he believed them to be true Any other pre3umption in such case would be violent illiberal and unjust The language of Mr Justice Thacker can be applied to the case here and hence we see no error in the refusal of the Circuit Court of Russell county to quash the attachment on this ground The affidavit being sufficient as we have seen we come to consider the question raised by the second assignment of error viz Whether the allegations of the affidavit were sufficiently proven to justify the court below in overruling the motion to quash on this ground The burden of proof was as contended by the appellant on the plaintiff in the court below to sustain the truth of the allegations and this should have been required unless the facts alleged necessary to sustain the attachment were admitted by the defendant We are clearly of the opinion that the court erred in refusing to quash the attachment on the ground that it sufficiently appears from the defendants an swer that it was removing portions of its property out of the State so that any execution obtainable at law by the plaintiffs would not be 42 May1895 CLINCH RIVER MINERAL CO V HARRISON available The fact is that this does not appear in the defendants answer except in the same connection with an explanation in the words that such shipments were made in the due and regular course of business and that the only market for baryta is outside of the State and to no one is this fact better known than to the complainant  It is too well settled for argument here that the whole of the answer if used at all in support of the complainants bill or as to a particular allegation must be read and taken together Bartons Chancery Prac tice Vol 1 399 and 400 and cases there collated and especially the case of MIorrisons Exors v Grubbs 23 Gratt 342 Following this established rule the answer of the defendant company to the charge that it was removing portions of its property out of the State c did not justify the Circuit Court in sustaining the attachment in the ab sence of proof sustaining the allegation This court cannot be too emphatic in the expression of its opinion that the shipment of products of any enterprise out of the State in the due course of business or trade where the removal is not permanent and the proceeds are brought back within the State is not sufficient ground for an attach ment and we think that this rule applies with all of its force to the case at bar The complainants had been conducting this business of mining manufacturing and selling baryta up to the time that the de fendant company became the owner of the leaseholds and the entire equipment of thb business and it appears in the record that complain ants were of necessity better informed than any one else that the only market for the baryta is outside the State In fact it is not denied by complainants that upon making the sale to Bachman and his asso ciates complainants furnished a list of parties who would purchase the products of the enterprise and that all of the parties on the list were outside the State The statute doesi not mean to designate as cause for attachment every transitory or temporary removal What is meant is permanent removal Wade on Attachments sec 91 Warden v Thrilkeld 52 Iowa 134 Russell v Wilson 18 Louisiana 367 The defendant company could make no profitable use of the property bought of the compplainants unless the products of the business could be mar keted Hence so long as it was honestly shipping such products to market though out of the State an attachment was not authorized it appearing that the proceeds of the sales were being brought back into the State But on another ground appellees contend that the decree of the court below was justified and that the attachment in this case should have 43VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER been sustained viz The bill having charged that the defendant com pany had also on hand a considerable stock of general merchandise which it was converting into money with intent to hinder delay and defraud complainants and other creditors and the answer of the de fendant company not denying this charge or making reference to this stock of general merchandise to this extent the bill stood as taken for confessed or in other words this charge must be taken as admitted and no proof of it was required by complainants This is not what we understand to be the established rule In Dangerfield  als v Claiborne  ats 2 H  M page 17 the learned Chanceller of the Superior Court of Chancery for the Rich mond District after stating the question to be whether allegations in the bill not answered shall be considered as admitted or must be proved by the plaintiffs says The rule in future will be understood and settled that where the answer is not responsive to a material alle gation of the bill the plaintiff may except to it as insufficient or may move to have that part of the bill taken for confessed but if he does neither he shall not on the trial avail himself of any implied admis sion by the defendant for w here the defendant does not answer at all the plaintiff cannot take his bill for confessed without an order of the court to that effect and having it served upon the defendants and this is the only evidence of his admission Of course if this mode of pro ceeding as to the confession of the whole bill be correct it must be equally correct as to the confession of any part This rule has been followed in all the cases reported in our State Reports where the ques tion has arisen andmaintained by our learned commentators Argen bright v Cawilpbell and wife 3 H  M 165 Coleman v Lyne 4 Rand 454 Cropper v Burtons 5 Leigh 426 432 Miller v Argyles Exor et als Ibid 460 Robinsons Prac Vol 2 313 and Bartons Chan Prac Vol 1 398 and 399 Says Barton Those allegations of a bill which are not responded to by the answer although an exception would properly lie on that ac count are yet not to be taken as admitted but must be proved by the plaintiff In those cases where a different doctrine is held the allegation was that some fact did not exist or that something was not done In Argenbright v Campbell and wife supra Judge Tucker deliver ing the opinion of this court says  If the defendant does not answer the allegations of the plaintiffs bill nor by his answer confess them although there be allegata before the Chancellor there are no probata 44 May1895 CLINCH RIVER MINERAL CO V HARRISON and it was the folly of the plaintiff not to except to the answer if he relied upon a discovery of facts known to the defendant only or not to have proceeded to take depositions to prove the allegations of his bill if he thought he could obtain such proof elsewhere Even if it were proper to read and consider the affidavits submitted by the plaintiffs at the hearing of this case below they do not relieve the situation as they afford no proof of this allegation nor of any other upon which the attachment could rest nor is there any force in the con tention of appellees that the rule as to the weight of a commissioners report laid down in Bowers v Bowers 29 Gratt 697 and cases follow ing it has application to this case The commissioner does not report the validity of the attachment but leaves the question as he should have done to the determination of the court We are therefore further of the opinion that the decree of the court below sustaining the attachment was not justified on this ground and the court to the extent that it maintained the attachment in the case must be reversed Having reached this conclusion we deem it unnecessary to consider the third assignment of error which is as we have seen that the at tachment should have been quashed because it was made returnable to rules and not to the term of the court Suffice it to say that it suffi ciently appears in the record that this irregularity was waived by the defendant company The cause is remanded to the Circuit Court of Russell county for such proceedings therein as may appear proper in accordance with the opinion of this court Reversed NOTE BY THE EDITORWe have heard that some members of the bar find fault with the rule as stated in the opinion of the court that the allegations of a bill which are not responded to in the answer are not to be taken as admitted but must be proved by the complainant It seems to the writer that the rule as stated in the opinion of the court is clearly established in Virginia by the authorities cited and that there is no Vir ginia decision contra The rule is however subject to a qualification not men tioned in the opinion doubtless because it was not necessary to the decision of the case in judgment The qualification is this that on a motion to dissolve an injunc tion the allegations not denied or admitted in the answer must be taken as true and this for the reasons given by Judge Green in Randolph v Randolph 6 Rand on p 197 This is an exception to the general rule before stated The rule as stated prevails in most jurisdictions certainly in Virginia In some of the States it has been changed by statute as for instance in West Va See Code of West Va chapter 125  36 The existence of these statutes serves to 4546 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER May show that the law was otherwise before their enactment We have no such statute in Virginia There can be no higher judicial authority than Chief Justice Marshall who in Young v Grundy 6 Cranch 51 puts the statement of the rule with its qualifica tion in a nutshell thus If the answer neither admits nor denies the allega tions of the bill they must be proved upon the final hearing Upon a question of dissolution of an injunction they are to be taken as true The proper practice would seem to be if the answer does not respond to a material allegation of the bill the complainant if he desires such response should except to the answer on theground of insuficiency specifically pointed out and if he fails to make such exception and have it passed upon by the court he waives all objection to the answer for insufficiency and except on a motion to dissolve an injunction must prove the allegations as to which the answer is silent

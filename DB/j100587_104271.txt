 FROM THE LATIN BY T S M D F R S S E C T I O N 1 IN THE YEAR 1730 THE PERSONS APPOINTED TO TAKE CARE OF THE DIKES ON OUR COASTS OBSERVED THAT THE PILES MADE OF THE HARDEST OAK DEFENDING THE  THIS IS HERE INSERTED IN ENGLISH BECAUSE A VERY AMPLE TREATISE HATH BEEN PUBLISHED IN LATIN ON THE SAME SUBJECT INTITULED GODOFREDI SELLII J U D R S LOND S HIST NAT TEREDINIS SEU XYLOPHAGI MA RINI TUBULOCONCHOIDIS TRAJ AD RHEN 1733 410 COASTS277 COASTS OF THE NETHERLANDS AGAINST THE SEA WERE EAT THROUGH IN A FEW MONTHS SO AS TO BE BROKEN BY THE LEAST EXTERNAL FORCE SURPRISED AT THIS UNCOMMON AND DANGEROUS PHAENOMENON THEY INQUIRED INTO ITS CAUSE AND SAW THAT A SORT OF WORMS BEFORE THAT TIME VERY SCARCE BUT NOW INCREASED TO AN INCREDIBLE NUMBER HAD IN SO SHORT A TIME EAT INTO THOSE PILES BETWEEN THE HIGHEST AND LOWEST WATERMARKS AND THREATENED VERY GREAT DAMAGE TO THE INHABITANTS OF THESE COUNTRIES THE SUPERSTITIOUS POPULACE IMMEDIATELY PERSUADED THEMSELVES THAT THIS NEW GENUS OF ANIMALS WAS CREATED BY THE DIVINE WRATH FOR PUNISHING THE SINS OF MANKIND BUT PRYING EXPERIENCE HAS TAUGHT THAT THOSE WORMS LIKE OTHER INSECTS WERE CREATED IN THE BEGINNING BUT NOW MULTIPLIED TO AN INCREDIBLE DEGREE FROM SOME UNKNOWN CAUSE S E C T II IF A PILE OF THE HARDEST OAK HAS STOOD SIX MONTHS ON THE SHORE AND BE TAKEN OUT IN SUMMER OR AU TUMN THERE APPEARS MUD AND FILTH STICKING TO ITS OUTWARD SURFACE WHICH BEING SCRAPED OFF WITH A KNIFE DISCOVERS A VAST NUMBER OF HOLES SCARCELY AS LARGE AS PINS HEADS S E C T III IF YOU VIEW THIS MUD SECT II THROUGH A MI CROSCOPE YOU WILL SEE 1 A NUMBER OF WHITISH POINTS NOT BIGGER THAN GRAINS OF SAND 2 SOME VERY SMALL WORMS N N THE278 THE WHITISH POINTS SEEM TO BE THE EGGS OF THIS INSECT AND THE WORMS TO BE SUCH AS ARE ALREADY HATCHED FROM THEM AND THESE WORMS GRADUALLY PER FORATING THE OUTWARD SURFACE OF THE WOOD REN DERED SOFT BY LYING IN THE WATER MADE THE AFORESAID HOLES SECT II AND THROUGH THEM WORKED THEIR WAY INTO THE SUBSTANCE OF THE WOOD S E C T IV A SMALL STYLE OF WHALEBONE OR LEAD THRUST INTO THESE SMALL HOLES RUNS STRAIT INTO THEM FOR THREE OR FOUR LINES SO THAT ITS OUTER END ALWAYS MAKES A RIGHT ANGLE WITH THE PILE BUT AFTERWARDS IF THE STYLE BE GENTLY PUSHED FORWARD IT DOES NOT CONTINUE IN THE STRAIT LINE BUT RUNS EITHER WAY GENERALLY UP WARD S E C T V BUT IF ONE OF THESE PILES SECT II BE SPLIT LENGTHWISE WITH A HATCHET OR WEDGE IT IS FOUND FULL OF PASSAGES OR HOLLOW CYLINDRICAL DUCTS EACH OF WHICH CONTAINS A WORM SURROUNDED WITH A THIN TESTACEOUS SUBSTANCE EXACTLY FILLING THE DUCT AND FORMING ITS INVOLUCRUM OR SHEATH IN WHICH SHEATH IT CAN MOVE WITH FREEDOM SEE SECT XIX THESE DUCTS SECT IV BEGINNING AT THE OUTWARD SURFACE BY A NARROW HOLE GROW GRADUALLY WIDER AND RUN EITHER STRAIT OBLIQUE UPWARD OR DOWNWARD BUT WHAT IS MOST SURPRISING IS THAT THESE DUCTS NEVER RUN INTO ONE ANOTHER NOR COMMUNICATE BUT EACH OF THEM CONTINUES SEPARATE FOR EVERY SINGLE WORM OVER THE WORMS HEAD THERE ARE FOUND TWO OR THREE DROPS OF A SALT LIQUOR THICKER THAN WATER BUT NOT279 NOT THE LEAST APPEARANCE OF THE DUST OF THE CORRODED WOOD S E C T VI WHENCE IT APPEARS THAT ALL THE WOOD WHICH HAD BEFORE FILLED UP THE PLACE OF THE DUCT IN WHICH THE WORM WITH ITS COVERING IS NOW FOUND WAS EATEN AND CONSUMED BY THE WORM AND AS IT SEEMS QUITE INCREDIBLE THAT AN ANIMAL WHICH APPEARS SOFT AND ALMOST AS FLUID AS THE WHITE OF AN EGG SHOULD BE ABLE TO EAT THROUGH SUCH HARD WOOD I OFFER THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS XYLOPHAGOUS WORM TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY IN ORDER TO GIVE THEM SOME KNOWLEDGE OF THIS WATERINSECT WHICH HAS DONE SO MANY MILLIONS DAMAGE TO THESE COUNTRIES S E C T VII THEY ARE FOUND OF VARIOUS SIZES AND THICKNESS THERE ARE SOME OF THE YOUNGER ONES NOT ABOVE AN INCH OR TWO IN LENGTH SOME OF A MIDDLE SIZE SUCH AS WE HAVE REPRESENTED IN OUR FIRST AND SECOND FIGURES SEE TAB II AND SOME THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN INCHES LONG S E C T VIII BUT IN ORDER TO A MORE ACCURATE DESCRIPTION WE WILL DIVIDE THE ANIMAL INTO HEAD BODY AND TAIL THE HEAD IS OF A MOST WONDERFUL STRUCTURE BEING COVERED WITH TWO HARD I KNOW NOT WHICH TO CALL THEM SHELLS OR HEMICRANIA OF A SUBSTANCE NEI THER TESTACEOUS NOR OSSEOUS SECURING THEIR SOFTER CONTENTS AND BEING VIEWED THROUGH A MICROSCOPE THEY APPEAR AS IN FIGURE 3 AS WELL AS I COULD HAVE THEM DRAWN N N 2 S E C T280 S E C T IX THESE HEMICRANIA ARE TWO WHITE BODIES MUCH HARDER THAN THE SUBSTANCE WHICH FORMS THE TESTA CEOUS COVERING THE INNER SURFACE HOLLOW AND SMOOTH THE OUTER CONVEX AND ROUGH WITH THREE FIBRES RUNNING DIFFERENT WAYS AND BOTH TOGETHER PERFECTLY REPRESENT A DOUBLE BIT OF THAT KIND OF BORER WE CALL AN AUGAR S E C T X THE UPPER PART OF THE EXTERNAL CONVEX SURFACE FIG 3 A HAS A VERY SHARP EDGE IN WHICH THE FIRST SERIES OF FIBRES BEGINS FROM ONE POINT WHICH FIBRES GRADUALLY DILATING AND RUNNING LENGTHWISE END ABOUT THE MIDDLE PART OF IT AND THIS MIDDLE PART MAKES A RIGHT ANGLE WITH THE UPPER PART IN THIS PART THE FIBRES BEING ELEVATED RUN CROSSWISE FIG 3 B THE LOWER PART IS THICKER THAN THE UPPER BUT SOFTER AND LESS COMPACT IN THIS PART THE FIBRES ARE RAISED UP AND ROUGH FIRST CURVE THEN STRAIT AND LIKE THE OTHERS RUN LENGTHWISE TO THE LOWER EDGE OF THIS PART WHICH IS STRONGLY FASTENED TO THE HEAD BY VARIOUS LIGAMENTS FIG 3 C D S E C T XI THE CONCAVE OR INNER PART OF THESE HEMICRANIA SECT IX WHICH CONTAINS THE SOFTER PARTS OF THE HEAD IS VERY SMOOTH BUT ALMOST IN THE MIDDLE HAS A VERY SMALL AND TENDER EMINENCE OR PROCESS IN SHAPE MUCH LIKE DR RAUS PROCESS IN THE ORGAN OF HEARING FIXED AT ONE END AND LOOSE AT THE OTHER RUNNING ALMOST THE281 THE WHOLE WIDTH AND DOUBTLESS DESTIND FOR SUPPORT ING SOME OF THE INWARD PARTS OF THE HEAD SEE FIG 4 A S E C T XII THESE TWO HEMICRANIA CONNECTED TOGETHER BY STRONG LIGAMENTS AND AS IT WERE BY A SMALL HINGE BY MEANS WHEREOF THEY CAN DILATE WITHOUT SEPARATE ING BESIDES THEIR DEFENDING THE SOFT HEAD FROM EX TERNAL INJURIES ARE THE INSTRUMENTS WHEREWITH THE ANIMAL GETS ITS FOOD FOR WHATEVER WAY IT TURNS ITS HEAD THE RAISED AND ROUGH FIBRES RUNNING EITHER LENGTHWISE OR CROSSWISE ALWAYS RUB OFF SOME OF THE WOOD S E C T XIII THESE HEMICRANIA CAREFULLY REMOVED THE CON TAINED PARTS FIG 6 ARE LAID OPEN TO VIEW BUT THEY ARE SO SOFT AND OF SO WONDERFUL A STRUCTURE THAT THE EYE THOUGH ARMED WITH A MICROSCOPE CAN NEITHER DISCERN THEIR TRUE MAKE OR USE FIRST INDEED THERE APPEARS A MEMBRANE ENVELOPING THE WHOLE HEAD IN THE MIDDLE AND ANTERIOR PART WHICH IS NOT CO VERED BY THE SAID HEMICRANIA IT APPEARS AS IF RAISED BY A TUBERCLE FIG 6 C AND IN THAT PLACE IT IS OF A RED COLOUR BUT THE LOWER LIGAMENTOUS EDGE FIRMLY ADHERES BOTH TO THE SMALL PROCESS SECT XI AND TO THE LOWER EDGE OF THE HEMICRANIUM S E C T XIV THIS MEMBRANE CAREFULLY SEPARATED AND REMOVED FIG 7 A A IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SUBJACENT PULP YOU WILL FIND A SMALL PEARLIKE BODY PERFECTLY PEL LUCID SOMEWHAT PROTUBERANT ABOVE THE OTHER PARTS WHICH282 WHICH MADE THE TUBERCLE IN THE MEMBRANE SECT XII IT IS MUCH HARDER THAN THE OTHER CONTAINED PARTS OF THE HEAD AND BODY SO THAT IT WILL BEAR CUTTING WITH THE SCALPEL IT IS OF A RED COLOUR AS PERFECTLY PELLUCID AS A DROP OF WATER OF THE SHAPE OF A PEAR FROM A LARGER BASIS TERMINATING IN A POINT I CANNOT BETTER RESEMBLE IT TO ANY THING THAN TO THE CRYSTALLINE LENS OF THE EYE YET IN SPIRIT OF WINE IT PRESERVED ITS TRANSPARENCY BUT ITS BULK WAS DIMI NISHED FIG 7 B I CANNOT GUESS ITS USE IT DOES NOT SEEM TO ME AS IT DOES TO SOME TO BE THE ORGAN OF SIGHT FOR THE WORM SEEMS TO HAVE NO OCCASION FOR AN EYE AS SPENDING ITS LIFE IN PERFECT DARKNESS BESIDES THAT THE INVESTING MEMBRANE IS NOT TRANSPARENT AND THERE FORE WOULD OBSTRUCT THE SIGHT S E C T XV AT THE SIDES WHERE THE LOWER EDGES OF THE HE MICRANIA DO NOT TOUCH ONE ANOTHER THERE IS A SORT OF CAVITY AND IN THESE SIDES THE HARDER FIBRES MAY BE DISTINGUISHED DISPOSED IN SUCH A MANNER AS PERFECTLY TO RESEMBLE THE GILLS OF FISH AND THROUGH THEM THE WORM SEEMS TO BREATHE S E C T XVI THE EXTREME SOFTNESS OF THE OTHER PARTS OF THE HEAD PREVENTS OUR COMING AT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE USE OF THE MEMBRANES FURNISHED WITH FIBRES OF DIFFERENT TENDENCIES OR INQUIRING BY WHAT ORGANS THE WORM TAKES THE WOOD SHAVED OFF BY THE HE MICRANIA OR ROUGH SHELLS WHETHER IT DOES THIS BY SUCTION OR NOT BY WHAT MUSCLES OR HOW ACTING THIS283 THIS WONDERFUL HEAD IS MOVED TIS PROBABLE IN DEED THAT ITS MOTION CONSISTS IN THE OPENING AND CLOSING THESE SHELLS SECT VIII THAT SHAVE OFF THE WOOD AND THAT THE INNER PARTS HAVE A POWER TO MOVE ON ALL SIDES AS THE BALL DOES IN THE SOCKET OF THE EYE AND PERHAPS TO COME FORTH OF THESE SHELLS AND REENTER AFTER TAKING THEIR FOOD BUT OF THESE THINGS THERE CAN BE NO CERTAINTY BECAUSE THE PARTS DISSOLVE BETWEEN THE FINGERS S E C T XVII THE BODY VIEWED FORWARD FIG 2 IS OF A REDDISH COLOUR IN THE MIDDLE APPEARS A LINE OFTEN DARK BROWN OFTEN BLACKISH SOMETIMES NOT VISIBLE SOME TIMES RUNNING NEAR HALF THE LENGTH THE REST OF THE ANIMAL IS OF A WHITISH OR GREY COLOUR 1 IF YOU INTEND TO DISSECT IT AND EXAMINE THE INSIDE YOU MUST FIRST REMOVE A THIN MEMBRANE SUR ROUNDING THE WHOLE BODY WHICH FOR THAT REASON MAY BE CALLED THE CUTIS OR CUTICULA WHEN THIS IS REMOVED THERE APPEARS AN OBLONG VESSEL PLACED IN THE MIDDLE FIG 2 OF A REDDISH COLOUR FROM THE SHAVED WOOD OF WHICH IT IS FULL HENCE IT SEEMS TO BE THE STOMACH OR AT LEAST THE FIRST ORGAN OF DI GESTION 2 IN THE LOWER PART YOU WILL FIND ANOTHER VESSEL APPEARING LIKE A DARKBROWN LINE WHICH CONTAINS THE EXCREMENTS OF WHICH IT IS OFTEN FOUND FULL AND DISCHARGES THEM AT THE END OF THE TAIL 3 AT THE SIDES OF THE REDDISH VESSEL OR STOMACH SECT XVII 1 IS PLACED A WHITE CLAMMY FAT SUB STANCE STICKING TO THE FINGERS AND PERHAPS CONSTI TUTING THE FLESH OF THE ANIMAL S E C T284 S E C T XVIII WHERE THE BODY ENDS THE TAIL BEGINS THICKER THAN THE BODY AND RENDERED STRONGER BY CIRCULAR FIBRES AT ITS END IT HAS TWO SMALL HARD BODIES CONTAINING AND DEFENDING THE TENDER EXTREMITIES OF THE TAIL THIS TAIL THICKER THAN THE BODY TERMINATES IN TWO ENDS THE THICKEST OF WHICH CERTAINLY SERVES FOR THE DISCHARGE OF THE EXCREMENTS THE SLENDEREST DOUBTLESS FOR GENERATION AND THIS IT CAN STRETCH OUT TO AN INCREDIBLE LENGTH SO THAT IN WORMS THAT SEEMED TO BE IN COPULATION IT APPEARED ABOVE AN INCH OUT OF THE PILE THE TWO SMALL BODIES THAT CONTAIN THESE ENDS OF THE TAIL ARE OF A HARDER SUBSTANCE THAN EVEN THE HEMICRANIA THE OUTER PART IS GIBBOUS THE INNER HOLLOWED THE LOWER END IS BIFID WHENCE I CON JECTURE THAT THEY SERVE THE ANIMAL FOR FEET WHEN IT IS MOUNTING UPRIGHT OR CORRODING THE WOOD BY LEANING ON THEM AS ON A PROP FIG 8 S E C T XIX THE ABOVEDESCRIBED WORM DWELLS NOW VERY SE CURELY IN A RESTACEOUS TUBE OF A WHITE COLOUR WHICH IT EXACTLY FILLS YET SO AS TO BE ABLE TO MOVE WITH FREEDOM THAT TUBE LIKE THE COVERINGS OF SNAILS C DAILY GROWS WITH THE ANIMAL FROM THE MATTER WHICH PERSPIRES FROM ITS BODY WHENCE IT IS SOME TIMES FOUND STRAIT SOMETIMES BENT ACCORDING TO THE COURSE WHICH THE WORM STEERED IN CORRODING S E C T285 S E C T XX AS TO THEIR GENERATION IT IS PROBABLE ENOUGH THAT ANALOGOUS TO THAT OF OTHER INSECTS IT IS PERFORMED BY COPULATION OF MALE AND FEMALE FOR THEY CAN SO LENGTHEN ONE END OF THEIR TAIL AND THRUST IT OUT OF THE PILE THAT THEY MAY COPULATE BY THAT MEANS THEN THEY LAY THEIR EGGS IN THE WATER CLOSE TO THE PILES TO WHICH THEY STICK BY THEIR CLAMMY VISCID MATTER SUCH FOR EXAMPLE AS FROGS SPAWN AND AFTERWARDS BY THE HEAT OF THE SUN HATCH THE WORM WHICH IMMEDIATELY ENDEAVOURS TO GET INTO THE PILE SEE SECT II AND III I COULD NOT OBSERVE THE DIFFERENCE OF SEX EITHER WITH MY EYE OR A MICROSCOPE SOME THINK THEM HERMAPHRODITES AS SNAILS AND THAT THEY COPULATE IN THE SAME MANNER BUT THESE CONJECTURES ARE NOT VERY PROBABLE S E C T XXI MANY REMEDIES AND SECRETS FOR DESTROYING THESE DANGEROUS ENEMIES WERE IMMEDIATELY BOASTED OF WHICH FOR THE MOST PART WERE PREPARATIONS OF AR SENIC OR MERCURY AND ARE NOT WORTH ENUMERATING I WILL ONLY GIVE THE RECEIPT OF ONE WHICH IS THE BEST AND SUREST OF ALL TAKE AN IRON PLATE OF AN OBLONG FIGURE AND OF THE WIDTH OF THE PILE WITH A STRONG HANDLE AT EACH END ONE END OF THIS PLATE MUST BE ARMED WITH THICK NAILS HALF AN INCH LONG AND ABOUT AN INCH ASUNDER THE NAILS OF THIS PLATE MUST BE DRIVEN INTO A PILE OF ANY SLIGHT WOOD WITH A HAMMER AND THEN THE PLATE PULLED OFF BY MEANS OF ITS HANDLES O O AND286 AND THIS IS TO BE SO OFTEN REPEATED UNTIL THE PILE IS PERFORATED EVERYWHERE WITH SMALL HOLES THEN IT MUST BE DAWBED OVER WITH VARNISH IN THE HOTTEST SUN THE VARNISH IS IMBIBED BY THE SOFT WOOD WITH SO MANY HOLES IN IT AND WHILE THE VARNISH IS YET HOT LET IT BE STREWED OVER WITH BRICKDUST AND THIS IS TO BE REPEATED THREE OR FOUR TIMES AFTER THE PRE CEDING VARNISH IS THOROUGH DRY TILL THE PILE IS INTIRELY SURROUNDED WITH A STONY CRUST WHICH WILL BE IM PENETRABLE TO ALL INSECTS AND LAST MANY YEARS BUT THE DIVINE CLEMENCY HAS ALREADY SO FAR DE STROYED THESE PERNICIOUS INSECTS WHICH MULTIPLIED SO PRODIGIOUSLY FOR EIGHT OR NINE YEARS PAST THAT THERE IS GREAT ROOM FOR HOPE THAT OUR COUNTRY WILL IN A SHORT TIME BE INTIRELY FREED FROM THEM AN EXPLANATION OF T A B II FIG 1 THE PILEWORM OF ITS NATURAL SIZE LYING ON ITS BELLY FIG

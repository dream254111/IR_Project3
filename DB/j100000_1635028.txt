in structor in zoology at the University of Michi gan to succeed Dr Dana B Casteel DR EMIL BOSE of Danzig has been ap pointed professor of physics in the University of La Plata PROFESSOR J BAUSCHINGER has been ap pointed to succeed Professor E Becker as professor of astronomy and director of the university observatory at Strassburg DR EINAR HERTZSPRUNG Of Copenhagen has been appointed associate professor of astron omy and astrophysics at Gottingen DISCUSSION AND CORRESPONDENCE INDUSTRIAL FELLOWSHIPS THE incidental reference made by Professor Kipping in his address before the British Association to a scheme of industrial fellow ships which I have initiated in this univer sity has led to so many inquiries from indus trial chemists and to such general interest that I am compelled to present now its main outlines and present status rather than to wait as I had intended until its material results had determined fully its practicability The scheme was initiated through an article entitled Temporary Industrial Fellowships which was published in the North American Review for May 1907 This article was sub sequently included as the last chapter in a book called The Chemistry of Commerce Harpers The scheme as then evolved has developed as I gained experience into some thing somewhat different while it is essen tially the same I have found it practicable to claim on behalf of the university more advan tages than I at first thought possible Per haps the present nature of the scheme is better exemplified in one of the later fellowship agreements for example in Fellowship No 7 For the purpose of promoting the increase of useful knowledge the University of Kansas ac cepts from the A B C Glass Company having head offices at New York the foundation of a temporary industrial fellowship to be known as the A B C Fellowship It is mutually understood and agreed that the conditions governing this fellowship shall be as follows The exclusive purpose of this fellowship is an investigation into the optical properties of glass in relation to its chemical constitution to the furtherance of which the holder shall give his whole time and attention with the exception of three hours a week which he shall give to work of instruction in the chemical department The fellow shall be appointed by the chancellor of the university the director of the chemical department and the professor of industrial chem istry he shall have made previously a reputation in research he shall be a member of the univer sity and shall pay all regular fees with the excep tion of fees for laboratory and supplies for which his instruction shall be taken in lieu unless in the opinion of the appointers his demands become excessive in which case the donor shall be ex pected to reimburse the university he shall work under the advice and direction of the professor of industrial chemistry and he shall forward periodically through the professor of industrial chemistry reports of the progress of his work to the A B C Company For the support of this fellowship which shall extend through a period of two years from the date of appointment of the fellow the A B C Glass Company agrees to pay fifteen hundred dollars 1500 per year payable annually to the university on the date on which the fellow begins work at the university This sum shall be paid by the university in monthly installments to the holder of the fellowship Any and all discoveries made by the fellow during the tenure of this fellowship shall become the property of the A B C Glass Company sub ject however to the payment by them to the fellow of ten 10 per cent of the net profits to be commuted at the desire of either party through the arbitration provided for herein arising from such discoveries it being understood that the fellow shall be regarded as the inventor At any time during the tenure of his fellowship the holder shall at the option of the donor take out patents at the expense of the donor on condition that at the time of making application therefor he shall assign his right to the donor under the conditions of this agreement At or before the expiration of the fellowship the business services of the fellow may be secured by the A B C Glass Company for a term of three years on condition that the terms of such services are satisfactory to both parties at interest 736 SCIENCEMAY 7 1909 SCIENCE In the event of any disagreement between the donor and holder of this fellowship it is under stood and agreed that the chancellor of the uni versity or one whom he may appoint shall act as arbiter as to all matters of fact that his decisions shall be binding upon the parties at issue and that they shall obtain such decision before having recourse to the courts It is also understood and agreed that during the tenure of this fellowship the holder may pub lish such results of his investigation as do not in the opinion of the company injure its interests and that on the expiration of the fellowship the holder thereof shall have completed a comprehen sive monograph on the subject of his research containing both what he and others have been able to discover A copy of the monograph shall be forwarded to the A B C Company and a copy shall be signed and placed in the archives of the university until the expiration of three years from that date when the university shall be at liberty to publish it for the use and benefit of the people Signed on behalf of the University of Kansas Date  Signed on behalf of the A B C Glass Company  Date  There have been so far accepted by the uni versity the following fellowships 1 An Investigation into the Chemistry of Laun dering having for its object an improvement which will save in some measure laundered fab rics It yields 500 a year together with 10 per cent of the net profits 2 A Search for a New Diastase The present source of the best diastase is expensive The investigation has as a matter of fact developed into an attempt to make a new fodder upon scien tific principles It yields 500 a year and under the original agreement 10 per cent of the gross proceeds for three years 3 An Attempt to Utilize the Constituents of Waste Buttermilk which at present in butter factories goes down the drains These constitu ents which it is desirable to conserve are pri marily caseine and secondarily lactic acid and sugar of milk The fellowship yields 500 a year and ten per cent of the net protis 4 An Investigation into the Chemistry of Baking This investigation was established by the National Association of Master Bakers with the object not only of improving the chemistry of bread but as well of providing for the asso 737 ciation a trained expert upon whom they could afterwards rely It yields 500 a year together with a lump sum to be settled by arbitration if necessary 5 An Investigation into the Constituents of Crude Petroleum I can not with propriety state the precise object of this investigation The fel lowship yields 1000 a year and 10 per cent of the net profits 6 An Attempt to Improve the Enamel upon the Enamellined Steel Tanks used in all kinds of chemical operations on a large scale This fellow ship was established by the largest manufacturer of these tanks in the world It yields 1300 a year together with an additional consideration to be decided upon for the service rendered by the chancellor of the university or one whom he may appoint 7 An Investigation into the Relation between the Optical Properties of Glass and Its Chemical Constitution This fellowship yields 1500 a year and 10 per cent of the net profits 8 The Discovery of New Utilities for Portland Cement and of Improvements in Its Manufacture This fellowship yields 1500 a year and a large additional consideration dependent upon success The fellows for Fellowships Nos 7 and 8 have not yet been selected In addition to the foregoing fellowships there are certain others assured but not yet established 9 An Investigation into Certain Glands of Deepsea Mammals It yields 1500 a year and an additional consideration to be decided upon by arbitration This fellowship is to be a benefac tion 10 The Discovery of New Utilities for Ozone It yields 2000 a year and 10 per cent of the net profits The tenure of all fellowships is two years It is regrettable that in accordance with the terms of the agreement it is impossible to publish at this time the results so far obtained It may be said however that the progress of the fellows has been gratifying It is signifi cant in this connection that Fellowship No 1 which expires shortly is to be continued at double the value for three months at the end of which time the donors will either take the fellow and his process into the factory or they will continue his fellowship through a third year at the increased amount while with Fel lowship No 2 the donors have already indiN S VOL XXIX No 749 cated their intention to continue it through out a third year the progress of the others has exceeded that of the first two and has sur passed expectations Most of these fellowships have arisen through letters of inquiry from the various companies I have not gone out seeking fel lowships in general Had I done so it is not unreasonable to suppose that by this time there might have been from thirty to fifty Owing to the fact that these fellowships have no relation to ordinary fellowships and that the scheme is essentially a new one it has been deemed advisable to establish them at intervals Proceeding in this way and learn ing as one went the scheme has undergone a natural and advantageous development The degree to which it has been systematized its effect upon the chemical department the re sults of the relations of the different researches and reseachers to one another and the wholly unexpected interactional relation of the do nating companies to one another I shall re serve for a future communication While it should be said that as yet this scheme of in dustrial fellowships is wholly experimental and tentative it ought also to be said that the two years experience has not shown that it is any other than a sane and practical relation be tween the university and industry to the ad vantage of all concerned ROBERT KENNEDY DUNCAN UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS April 10 1909 ELEMENTARY EMBRYOLOGY COURSES THE publication of Professor Lillies De velopment of the Chick and the excellent character of his treatment of the subject sug gests comment upon the custom of using the chick for introducing students to embryology Since the days of von Baer and before the chick has been used for embryological study more than any other form This has probably been due in part to its familiarity and to the ease of obtaining embryos of any desired age Foster and Balfours very valuable though poorly written Elements of Embryology based on the chick for so long the only avail able textbook for immature students fastened more firmly the custom of using the chick in introductory embryological courses Now comes Lillies fine treatment of the same sub ject which is likely to establish the chick in almost undisputed possession of these courses Chick embryos are easy to obtain and easy to manipulate and much has been written about them they also have decided resem blance to human embryos Yet in spite of these advantages I can not but feel that chick embryos are peculiarly illadapted to the use of students beginning the study of embry ology The embryo chick is a highly special ized form adapted to a very peculiar environ ment within an egg shell and still further distorted from the general vertebrate type by the presence of the huge yolk mass These special adaptations are of great interest but it has been my experience that they assume an undue prominence in the minds of stu dents and prevent their readily grasping the general phenomena of development of verte brates unless some less specialized form as for example the frog has first been studied The first three years I taught elementary embryology we began with the chick and used it chiefly if not exclusively Since then each year after a brief consideration of the cell its organs and its behavior in mitosis and a rapid survey of cleavage and gastrulation in half a dozen forms we have taken up the embryology of the frog using Marshalls Vertebrate Embryology modified and sup plemented of course by the lectures The laboratory work has covered the same ground as the classroom work After completing the study of organology in the frog two weeks to four have been given to the chick and two or three lectures to comparisons with the development of mammalia The point I would like to emphasize is that I have found that the students in these later courses got a far better grasp of the embry ology of the chick in two weeks study follow ing careful work upon the frog than they ever succeeded in obtaining when they began with the chick and devoted all the time to this sub ject and of course they got a far more ade quate conception of the embryology of verte 738 SCIENCE

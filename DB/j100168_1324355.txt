removed Indeed even where title to land was in dispute equity might conceivably have decided the rights of the parties with out a previous trial at law but equity from early times has consistently re fused to do so preferring to leave the parties to prove their titles before a jury EXTRATERRITORIAL EFFECT OF ADOPTION  Adoption is the creation of the relationship of parent and child between strangers in blood It is not a commonlaw right but comes from the civil law and has gradually been introduced into the statutes of several states in this country Follow ing the usual law as to statuses jurisdiction to create it depends on domicil A valid decree of adoption can be given by the courts of the state where both parties are domiciled but not by a state where neither is domiciled and in this respect it differs from the creation of the marital status If the parties have separate domicils that of the child probably has jurisdiction at least if the adopting parent does the necessary acts therein2 although the argument that as in divorce a state in which either party is domiciled can give a valid decree fails to distinguish between the creation of a status and its destruction3 Granting that a valid adoption has been consummated what is its effect on the succession to property in another state  It has been said that where by the law of the domicil a person is the  heir  and  child  of another the state with jurisdiction to determine the status having so declared the formers standing as heir must everywhere be recognized and that if the latter dies intestate leaving property in another state by whose law it goes to the heir the former is entitled4 This assumes that status alone decides succession overlooking that succession involves also a matter of descrip tion5 The descent of realty is governed by the lex rei sitce6 England does not say that English land shall succeed to whomever is declared heir by foreign law but that it shall go to the eldest son born in lawful wedlock A foreigners natural son legitimated through subsequent marriage by the law of his domicil is not therefore the heir of English land7 Similarly a foreigners adopted son is not the heir of land in a state which knows nothing of adoption not because he is not heir in the state of domicil but for the reason that he does not fulfill the description of the person to whom the lex rei sitce says land shall descend In order therefore to determine the rights of a foreigners adopted child it is essential to ascertain whether adopted children are heirs in the state of the situs5 If statutes of adoption in that state say nothing about inher itance it may be argued that the status is to be interpreted in the light of 10 Ilondell v Consolidated Gas Co 89 Md

capacity of a blood relation8 But the better view appears to be that as adoption is distinctly in derogation of the common law and the commonlaw rights of other relatives the statutes must be strictly construed and the child given inheritable capacity only when there is an express direction to that effect9 A foreigners adopted child must also be denied capacity if while recognizing the right of in heritance of adopted children the statutes apply or are construed to apply only to adoption proceedings provided by that state In a recent case suc cession to land was denied in the state of the situs where the statute re quired acknowledgment and registration in the probate court as the act of adoption0 Brown v Finley 47 So 577 Ala As the law of the domicil and of the situs concurred in allowing adopted children to inherit the result seems only to be justified on a needlessly narrow construction of the statute1 RECEIVERS CERTIFICATES Since the decision in the leading case of Meyer v 7ohnstonl it is undoubted law that when it is necessary for the preservation of the property railroad receivers have power to issue with the consent of a court of chancery receivers certificates to become a first lien on the property even against the will of the mortgagees whose priority is thus divested This practice may be defended on the theory that the court having obtained control of the res must for the protection of all parties in terested see that it does not diminish in value2 The courts however have not limited the issue of certificates to that actually needed for the preserva tion of the property but have extended the doctrine of Meyer v yohnston until receivers have been given power to issue certificates for almost any pur pose As the authorities now stand certificates are issued under the pretense of preservation to complete work already begun8 to buy new rolling stock4 and indeed some cases have gone so far as to allow certificates to be issued to pay off wages accrued before the receiver was appointed at the cost of preferring unsecured to secured creditors5 Those courts which have gone to this extent groping for a satisfactory reason upon which to base their de cisions have drawn an unwarranted analogy to the doctrine of salvage in admiralty law This practice should certainly not be extended for the power of a court of chancery to divest the lien of prior encumbrancers without their consent is difficult to defend upon any sound principle of legal reasoning The under taking of new enterprises should at any rate be no justification It is certain that a railroad upon finding itself in distress could not prefer those coming 8 Markover v Krauss 132 Ind 294 See Hunter Rom Law 3 ed 2034 9 Keegan v Geraghty IoI Ill 26 It is on this principle that where the right to inherit from the parent is given the child cannot inherit from other relatives of the parent unless the statutes so provide Cf N Y Life Ins etc Co v Viele I6I N Y II 10 Ala Civ Code 1907

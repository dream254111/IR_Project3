reviews a decree of the Circuit Court for the Eastern Division of the Northern District of Illinois in favor of the United States in a suit to compel Carter as an engineer in charge of harbor improements to account for the share of profits secretly received by him from the contractors and to follow his illicit gains into the property or securities into which they had gone The court after reviewing the evidence in relation to Captain Carters conduct in preparing the specifications advertising the acceptance of bids and his invariable exercise of options and other discretionary powers

Bill Posting  Distributing Co v City of Denver 107 Pacific Reporter 261 Teachers Right to Punish PupilWhere a lad had been a pupil of a school until Friday preceding the Wednesday when he was switched and it did not appear that he had ceased in the meantime to be a pupil of the school and that if he had in fact withdrawn the teacher had no notice thereof the Supreme Court of Arkansas in Dodd v State 126 Southwestern Reporter 834 held that the school16 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER master was warranted in treating him as a pupil when he appeared at the schoolhouse window after the noon recess attracting the atten tion of the children and in chastising him upon his refusal to leave the grounds or come into the school Statute of LimitationsAcknowledgment to Take Case Out of Stat utePromise to Fix It Up All RightEyre v McFarlane Full Court May 11 1910 A promise to fix it up all right in a week or two in a letter written by the debtor in reply to a written demand for payment of the debt is a sufficient acknowledgment to take the case out of the statute of limitations and start it running anew Edmonds v Goater 21 L J Ch N S 290 and Collis v Stack 1 H  N 605 followed But a promise to pay the debt as soon as the debtor could get the money is conditional only and without evidence that the debtor had got the money would not be a sufficient acknowledgment to prevent the statute runningCanada Law Journal It is not necessary that the acknowledgment for an indebtedness so as to prevent or repel the bar of the statute of limitations should be in precise or set terms Hence it is unnecessary to use the words ac knowledge or promise Brewer v Brewer 6 Ga 587 Harris v It is the duty of the teacher to enforce the rules and regulations adopted by the school directors for the government of the school and to maintain discipline in the school And in order to maintain discipline or to compel obedience to any lawful regulation the teacher may inflict corporal punishment upon a pupil since the teacher for the time being stands to some extent at least in loco parentis and has such a portion of the powers of the parent delegated to him namely that of restraint and correction as may be necessary to an swer the purpose for which he is employed 25 Encyc Law 2d Ed p 24 If the teacher inflicts punishment wantonly or to gratify malice he will be liable 25 Encyc Law 2d Ed p 25 In some of the cases it is held that the teacher must exercise judgment and discretion and in every instance be governed as to the severity of the punishment by the nature of the offence and the age size and endurance of the pupil and that he will be liable if he inflicts punishment which in the judgment of a reasonable man is clearly excessive or immoderate regardless of whether his motive was malicious or not On the other hand it is held that for an error in judgment although the punishment is unnecessarily excessive if it is not of a nature to cause lasting injury and if the teacher acts in good faith he is not liable It is a question for the jury upon the facts of the case whether or not punishment was excessive 25 Encyc Law 2d Ed p 25 But in State z Mizner 50 Iowa 145 32 Am Rep 128 it was said Any punishment with a rod which leaves marks or welts on the person of the pupil for two months afterward or much less time is immoderate and excessive and the court would have been justified in so instructing the jury 25 Encyc Law 2d Ed p 25 August 310

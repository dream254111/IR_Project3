of the work to be undertaken The events of the past year have proved how fortunate it was that Naples and not Messina as was originally intended should be the site of the aquarium In the organization of the aquarium the university idea was developed to a degree never before practically realized In practise as well as theory this was an institution of learning as distinct from teaching Iere are gathered together at one time as many as seventy or eighty representatives of the lead ing universities of the world professors as sistants and occasionally undergraduate stu dents all engaged in carrying on investiga tions The expenses of the zoological sta tion are in part defrayed by money received from the sale of entrance tickets to the aquarium and in part by the subvention of different countries Germany pays for 22 places in the laboratory Italy for 9 the United States for 5 England for 3 Russia 4 Austria 2 Hungary Holland Belgium Switzerland and Roumania each 1 Here zoologists chemists anatomists physi ologists pathologists practising physicians and professional philosophers are all intent upon the study of various problems the solu tion of which will eventually throw more light upon the origin and nature of the vital proc esses in the lower organisms and consequently and ultimately in man Thoroughly imbued with the spirit of Darwin Dohrn long ago realized that the only successful way to under stand the complex phenomena of human life was to begin by studying the simpler manifes tations in the lower animals The continuity and similarity of the life processes in the whole scale of animal life is unbroken You scientists have little understanding of his tory complained Mommsen Why assume retorted Dohrn  that history begins and ends with mans appearance on the earth Here in the aquarium we are interested in ancient history for here we study mans ancestors From the crest of the mountains back of Sorrento turning to the south one looks down upon the Gulf of Salerno on whose shores for centuries stood the most famous medical school of medieval times where were gathered from the shores of Africa and Eu rope the most renowned students of their day Today only the memory of that school re mains Turning to the north one beholds the great expanse of the Bay of Naples and by the aid of a glass discovers the aquarium the institution which today has fallen heir to all that was best in the traditions of the Salerno school The latter was a slow growth the re sult of the labors of many men upbuilding painfully for many years while the Naples Aquarium was the creation of one man Anton Dohrn whose life was devoted to de vising and perfecting unequaled facilities for the study of zoology and he builded better than he knew for he actually although un consciously created a university Year after year a greater number of trained investiga tors representing practically all the civilized governments of the world are gathered to gether at the aquarium than are to be found in any other institution in the world Within this building racial prejudices and differences are ignored or forgotten by the brotherhood of scholars who carry on their work for the benefit of their common humanity The scientific work of Dohrn has received generous commendation from his fellow work ers in the sciences but it still remains for those who labor to preserve the peace of the world to show their appreciation of the quiet unostentatious but potent influence upon the thought of mankind of  the peace congress which is continuously in session at the Naples

sociation for the Advancement of Science Section B and the American Physical Society will in general hold joint sessions for reading papers The presiding officers will be Dr L A Bauer of Washington chairman of Sec tion B and Professor Henry Crew of North western University president of the Physical Society The address of the retiring vice president of Section B will be given by Pro fessor Karl E Guthe of the University of Mlichigan Section B will hold one joint ses sion with Section A at which several distin guished scientists have promised papers which will be of interest to other sections Another session will be given to the discussion of the teaching of physics perhaps in conjunction with Section L The program of special papers on research topics will be in charge of the secretary of the Physical Society and titles should be sent to him at Ithaca N Y All titles should be in his hands by December 14 accompanied by a suitable abstract ERNEST MiERRITT Sec Am Physical Soc ALFRED D COLE Sec of Section B A A A S SECTION A MIATHEMATICS AND ASTRONOMY ARRANGEMENTS have been made for two joint sessions of Section A The first of these is to be held jointly with Section B on Tuesday afternoon December 28 and the second is to be a joint session with the American AMathe matical Society on Wednesday morning The vicepresidential address of Section B is to be given during the former of these sessions and that of Section A during the latter The sec tion will organize on Mlonday morning and the sessions of Monday afternoon and Tues day morning will be devoted almost exclu sively to astronomical papers Titles and ab stracts should reach the secretary before December 15 G A MILLER Secretary of Section A SECTION F ZOOLOGY OWING to a clerical error the preliminary announcement of the Boston meeting wrongly states that a joint session will probably be ar ranged between Section F and the American Society of Zoologists The officers of Section F proposed a plan for referring to the Ameri can Society of Zoologists the reading of all worthy zoological papers by authors who are not members of that society but it was re jected by a vote  to keep the meetings of the American Society of Zoologists entirely inde pendent As a result it is planned by the officers of Section F to hold on Friday De cember 31 a meeting for reading of papers by members of that section who do not on their personal responsibility arrange for pre senting their papers in the meetings of the American Society of Zoologists or elsewhere On the days when that society is reading technical papers Section F will offer a series of programs designed to appeal to the intelli gent public and to men of science who are not primarily zoologists Thus the conflicting 836 SCIENCE

field by use of iron filings The apparatus which was very simple is described as follows The object to be exhibited is placed on a base which in the speakers apparatus consisted of a 60 by 75 centimeter drawingboard covered wTth white paper Against two nails driven into this base near the back a large plane mirror is placed and inclined forward at any desired angle by means of a wire attached to the top of the mirror and passing through a binding post screwed into the back of the base To each upper corner of the mirror is clamped a 50 candlepower General Electrical Company stereopticon lamp protected in front by metal half shades These brilliantly illumin ate the object and obviate shadows The apparatus can of course be made permanent by hinging the mirror to the base and fasten ing the lights permanently It will be seen that the apparatus has many applications in the teaching of the biological as well as phys ical sciences in exhibiting objects that can not be turned on their edge The apparatus has the advantage over the projecting lantern with horizontal attachment first that it does not require a darkened room second opaque objects can be exhibited third the size of the object to be exhibited is limited only by the size of the mirror fourth the apparatus is not only easy to operate but can be put together from materials usually found in any laboratory

was pointed out in Biometrica Vol II No 4 1903 Darwin has given the name of sexual selection to the general conception of differential mating As opposed to pure random mating within the population we have first preferential mating in which male or female classes with certain values of a character find it less easy to mate than other classes with different values Secondly we have assortative mating in which while all classes of males and females find mates cer tain classes of males appear to be attracted to certain classes of females If the male class of a given character tends to mate with a female class with generally like character we have a tendency to homogamy Homogamy as one type of assortative mating is simply measured by the correlation between the two characters in the male and female of the pair The influence of homogamy on the character of successive generations of a population may be very great indeed and the whole range of effect from pure random matings to perfectly homogamous unions within a population is almost but not quite as important as the dif ference between self and cross fertilization in plants It has the distinctive features as compared with self fertilization that 1 it may have any degree of intensity 2 it may be confined to special characters and 3 it is not complicated by any of the supposed harmful effects of inbreeding In the paper from which the paragraph I have just quoted was taken we dealt with assortative mating in man with respect to a characterlongevityconcerning which there could not possibly be any conscious selection The characters dealt with by Pearson in for mer papers are alsoat least probablynot made the object of conscious selection The coefficients of correlation between man and wife in all these cases average about 2or husband and wife are as much alike as uncle and niece and probably as much alike as if not more alike than first cousins lPhil Trans Vol 187 A p 273 and Vol 195 A p 113 Biometrika II p 353 AUIJGST 25 190520 SCIENCE It seemed to me to be of interest now to test the strength of assortative mating with respect to a character in which there is known to be conscious selection The ages of the two members of the pair at once suggested itself It possesses an added interest because of the former work upon the age at death I accordingly tabulated the ages of twenty five hundred couples as given at the marriage license office at Chicago during the spring of 1904 Grouped in threeyear classes they are as shown in table The data are a little unsatisfactory because of the unfortunate but undeniable proneness of humanity to a lapse of honesty in the matter of age especially in this connection TABLE OF AGE WI 1618 1921 2224 2527 2830 3133 3436 3739 4042 4345 4648 4951 5254 5557 5860

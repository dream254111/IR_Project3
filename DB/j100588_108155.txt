J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,108155,CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE CHEMICAL HISTORY OF PALLADIUM AND PLATINUM,I206997, 275  XV CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE CHEMICAL HISTORY OF PALLADIUM AND PLATINUM BY ROBERT KANE IMD MRA COMMUNICATED BY FRANCIS BAILY ESQ VPRS EC C SC RECEIVED FEBRUARY 24READ MARCH 17 1842 NOTWITHSTANDING THE ATTENTION WHICH HAS BEEN PAID TO THE PROPERTIES OF THE NOBLE METALS BY THE CHEMISTS WHO HAVE MADE THEIR COMPOUNDS AN OBJECT OF STUDY THEIR HISTORY IS YET VERY FAR FROM THE STATE OF COMPLETENESS TO WHICH SO MANY DEPART MENTS OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY HAVE RECENTLY BEEN BROUGHT THE RESEARCHES HITHERTO MADE HAVE HAD FOR THEIR OBJECTS GENERALLY EITHER THE MORE DIRECT OR CERTAIN EXTRACTION OF THE METAL FROM THE STATE OF COMBINATION IN WHICH IT NATURALLY EXISTS OR THE EXAMI NATION OF SOME FEW COMPOUNDS WHICH WERE REMARKABLE FOR THEIR BEAUTY OR FACILITY OF PRODUCTION OR IMPORTANT FROM THEIR APPLICATIONS BUT THE GENERAL HISTORY OF THESE METALS HAS AS YET BEEN BUT IMPERFECTLY STUDIED AS MAY BE SEEN BY REFERENCE TO THE MEAGRE ACCOUNT OF THEIR SALTS AND OTHER COMPOUNDS WHICH EVEN THE MOST EXTENDED SYSTEMATIC WORKS PRESENT IT IS MY OBJECT IN THIS AND IN SOME SUBSEQUENT PAPERS TO EXAMINE SPECIALLY INTO THE COMPOSITION AND PROPERTIES OF THE COMPOUNDS OF PALLADIUM PLATINUM AND GOLD AND TO ENDEAVOUR TO ASCERTAIN HOW FAR THEY AGREE AND IN WHAT THEY DIFFER AS TO THE LAWS OF COMBINATION TO WHICH THESE COMPOUNDS ARE SUBJECTED AS THIS PAPER MAY BE CONSIDERED BUT AS THE COMMENCEMENT OF THIS WORK THE GENERAL BEARINGS OF WHICH MAY CHANGE ACCORDING TO THE PROGRESS OF OUR KNOWLEDGE I SHALL NOT ATTEMPT TO GIVE TO IT ANY SYSTEMATIC FORM OR TO ARRANGE THE BODIES TO BE DESCRIBED IN ANY ORDER OR CLASSIFICATION EXCEPT THAT ALL THE COMPOUNDS OF THE SAME METAL WILL IN EACH MEMOIR BE DESCRIBED TOGETHER IT IS MY DUTY AT THIS MOMENT TO EXPRESS MY SINCERE GRATITUDE AND THANKS TO THE COUNCIL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY WHICH MOST KINDLY PLACED IN MY HANDS FOR THE PURPOSES OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS A PORTION OF THE PALLADIUM THAT HAD BEEN BEQUEATHED TO THE SOCIETY BY ITS ILLUSTRIOUS DISCOVERER TO BE USED IN THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE SHOULD THE RESULTS I HAVE OBTAINED IN ENDEAVOURING TO EXTEND AND RENDER MORE ACCURATE OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE COMPOUNDS OF THAT REMARKABLE METAL APPEAR SUCH AS TO JUSTIFY THAT APPROPRIATION FOR WHICH WHEN MADE I FEEL I HAD LITTLE CLAIM I SHALL BE FULLY REWARDED FOR THE TIME AND LABOUR THEY HAVE REQUIRED AND USE MY BEST EFFORTS TO EXTEND THEM BY SUBSEQUENT RESEARCHES 2N2DR KANE ON THE CHEMICAL HISTORY SECTION IPALLADIUM COMPOUNDS OXIDES OF PALLADIUM IT HAS BEEN LONG ESTABLISHED THAT PALLADIUM COMBINES WITH OXYGEN AT LEAST IN TWO PROPORTIONS FORMING THE PROTOXIDE WHICH IS THE BASIS OF ITS ORDINARY SALTS AND THE DEUTOXIDE WHICH APPEARS TO BE ANALOGOUS TO THE DEUTOXIDE OF PLATINUM AND TO REACT IN MANY CASES AS AN ACID TO THIS LAST BODY I HAVE NOT HITHERTO DIRECTED MUCH AT TENTION BUT SOME PROPERTIES OF THE PROTOXIDE WHICH I HAVE ILOTICED APPEAR NOT UN WORTHY OF BEING DESCRIBED THE PROTOXIDE OF PALLADIUM IS BEST PREPARED BY THE DECOMPOSITION OF THE PROTOCHLO RIDE BY MEANS OF A SOLUTION OF CARBONATE OF SODA IN EXCESS THE PRECIPITATE WHICH FIRST FORMS IS LIGHTCOLOURED BUT IT SOON BECOMES DARKER CARBONIC ACID GAS IS DISEN GAGED AND FINALLY AN OCHREY BROWN POWDER FALLS WHICH BY DRYING BECOMES DARK BROWN THE PRECIPITATION IS IN THIS CASE BY NO MEANS PERFECT THE LIQUOR IS COLOURED YELLOW BY TRACES OF THE METAL DISSOLVED AND THE PRECIPITATE RETAINS WITH OBSTINACY TRACES OF THE ALKALI FROM WHICH HOWEVER IT MAY BE FREED BY WASHING WHEN THIS SUBSTANCE IS HEATED IT FIRST EVOLVES WATER AND THEN OXYGEN LEAVING A BLACK POWDER TO THE NATURE OF WHICH I SHALL RECUR BY A VERY HIGH TEMPERATURE FULL WHITE HEAT IT IS TOTALLY REDUCED TO THE METALLIC STATE THE ANALYSES OF THIS HYDRATED OXIDE WHEN FIRST PERFORMED LED TO VERY IRRECONCILE ABLE RESULTS OWING TO TWO CIRCUMSTANCES ST THAT THE OXIDE OF PALLADIUM IS BY NO MEANS SO EASILY REDUCED TO TE HE METALLIC STATE BY THE MERE AGENCY OF HEAT AS HAS BEEN SUPPOSED AND 2ND THAT ALTHOUGH THE PRECIPITATION OF THE HYDRATED OXIDE IS ACCOM PANIED WITH THE DISENGAGEMENT OF MUCH CARBONIC ACID YET THE PRECIPITATE ALWAYS CONTAINS SOME TRACES OF THAT ACID IT EFFERVESCES VERY DISTINCTLY WHEN DISSOLVED IN DILUTE MURIATIC ACID AND IS IN FACT A HIGHLY BASIC CARBONATE OF PALLADIUM RATHER THAN A TRUE HYDRATED PROTOXIDE THE FOLLOWING DETAILS OF THE EXPERIMENTS MADE AS TO ITS COMPOSITION WILL PLACE THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IN EVIDENCE A 53524 GRAINS OF A SPECIMEN WHICHL HAD BEEN CAREFULLY WASHED UNTIL THE LIQUORS CEASED TO REACT ALKALINE WERE GENTLY LEATED OVER THE FLAME OF A SPIRITLAMP UNTIL NO MORE TRACES OF WATER WERE EVOLVED THE RESIDUE A JET BLACK POWDER OF ANHYDROUS OXIDE WEIGHED 45224 GRAINS OR 84A49 PER CENT HAVING LOST 1551 APPARENTLY ONLY WATER B 41102 GRAINS OF ANOTHER PORTION SIMILARLY TREATED GAVE A DRY RESIDUE OF 34512 GRAINS OR 8396 PER CENT THIS WAS THEN HEATED TO FULL REDNESS AND WHEN COLD WEIGHED 311779 GRAINS OR 7732 PER CENT C 72481 GRAINS OF A SPECIMEN PREPARED AT ANOTHER TIME GAVE WHEN DRIED UNTIL THE LAST TRACES OF WATER HAD BEEN DRIVEN OFF A BLACK POWDER WEIGHING 61241 GRAINS OR 8449 PER CENT AND AT EXPOSURE TO A RED HEAT WAS REDUCED TO 56131 GRAINS OR 7745 PER CENT D 56 578 GRAINS OF A DIFFERENT SPECIMEN GAVE WHEN DRIED 48306 GRAINS OR 8538 276OF PALLADIUM AND PLATINUM PER CENT HAVING LOST 1462 OF WATER BY A RED HEAT IT GAVE OFF OXYGEN AND WAS RE DUCED TO 44846 GRAINS OR 7943 PER CENT THESE RESULTS PLACED TOGETHER FOR COMPARISON GIVE A B C D EXPELLED BY A MODERATE HEAT 1551 1604 1551 1462 EXPELLED BY A RED HEAT   4 664 704 5695 RESIDUAL BLACK POWDER   J 32 77A45 7943 THE MATERIAL 6 TO 7 PER CENT EXPELLED BY A RED HEAT IS OXYGEN GAS BUT I FOUND BY TRIALS CONDUCTED AFTER THE ABOVE RESULTS WERE OBTAINED THAT NEITHER IS ALL THE MA TERIAL EXPELLED BY A MODERATE HEAT MERELY WATER NOR IS THE RESIDUAL BLACK POWDER METALLIC PALLADIUM E TO DETERMINE THE NATURE OF THE BLACK POWDER WHICH REMAINS AFTER THE MODERATE IGNITION OF THE OXIDE 51346 GRAINS OF IT WERE INTRODUCED INTO A TUBE OF BOHEMIAN GLASS AND HEATED IN A CURRENT OF DRY HYDROGEN GAS IT BECAME OF ITSELF BRIGHTLY RED HOT WATER WAS ABUNDANTLY ALMOST EXPLOSIVELY FORMED AND THE POWDER ASSUMED AT ONCE A GRAY METALLIC ASPECT IT THEN WEIGHED 47165 GRAINS OR 91 85 PER CENT F TO CONTROL THIS RESULT ANOTHER PORTION OF THE BLACK POWDER OBTAINED FROM A DIFFERENT PORTION OF OXIDE WAS HEATED IN THE SAME WAY IN HYDROGEN GAS FROM 46300 GRAINS THERE REMAINED 42952 GRAINS OF METAL OR 9272 PER CENT THE QUANTITY OF OXYGEN THUS SHOWN TO BE COMBINED WITH THE METAL IN THIS BLACK POWDER IS ALMOST EXACTLY HALF THAT WHICH THE PROTOXIDE SHOULD CONTAIN IT MUST THERE FORE BE CONSIDERED AS SUBOXIDE OF PALLADIUM AT LEAST PROVIDED IT BE NOT A MIXTURE OF METAL AND PROTOXIDE WHICH SHALL BE DISCUSSED FURTHER ON I SHALL HERE ONLY COMPARE THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS WITH THOSE GIVEN BY THE FORMULA PD2 CL FOR ITS COMPOSITION THEORY EXPERIMENT PD2  1066 9302 9185 9272 0  80 698 8 15 728 1146 10000 1000 0 10000 THE MEAN QUANTITY OF BLACK SUBOXIDE OBTAINED BY THE MODERATE IGNITION OF THE HYDRATED OXIDE AS ALREADY FOUND IS 7807 AND THIS IS SHOWN BY THE LATTER EXPERIMENTS TO CONTAIN 7260 OF METAL EXCLUDING THEREFORE FOR THE MOMENT THE QUESTION WHETHER ANYTHING BUT WATER IS FIRST DRIVEN OFF WE FIND THAT THE OXIDE OF PALLADIUM MAY BE OB TAINED ANHYDROUS THAT BY GENTLE IGNITION IT ABANDONS ONEHALF OF ITS OXYGEN AND LEAVES A BLACK POWDER SUBOXIDE WHICH MAY BE TOTALLY REDUCED TO THE METALLIC STATE BY VIOLENT IGNITION OR BY HYDROGEN GAS AT INCIPIENT REDNESS THE MEAN QUANTITY OF SUBOXIDE FURNISHED FROM 100 OF DRY PROTOXIDE IN THE ABOVE DESCRIBED THREE ANALYSES MAY BE THUS COMPARED WITH THEORY THEORY EXPERIMENTMEAN OF B C D PD 0 1146 9347 7807 9227 0  80 653 654 7373 1226 10000 8461 10000 277278 DR KANE ON THE CHEMICAL HISTORY THE ANALYSIS D ALONE GIVES A IRESULT MUCH MORE CLOSELY APPROXIMATING TO THEORY BY IT THERE IS PD2 0 7943 OR 9303 0 595 OR 697 8538 10000 AS THERE WERE MANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH LED ME TO CONSIDER IT UNLIKELY THAT THE 15A42 THE MEAN QUANTITY OF MATERIAL EXPELLED FROM THE HYDRATED OXIDE BY A MODERATE HEAT COULD BE ENTIRELY WATER I DETERMINED THE REAL QUANTITY OF WATER PRESENT IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER THE SUBSTANCE WAS PLACED IN A TUBE OF BOHEMIAN GLASS WHICH AT ONE END WAS PUT IN CONNECTION WITH AN APPARATUS EVOLVING DRY HYDROGEN GAS AND AT THE OTHER EXTREMITY WAS ADAPTED TO A TUBE CONTAINING IECENTLY FUSED CHLORIDE OF CAL CIUM WHEN THE APPARATUS HAD BEEN COMPLETELY FILLED WITH HYDROGEN THE TUBE CON TAINING THE OXIDE OF PALLADIUM WAS HEATED BY MEANS OF CHARCOAL WATER WAS EVOLVED AND THE METAL REDUCED THE CURRENT OF GAS WAS CONTINUED UNTIL ALL WATER HAD BEEN CARRIED INTO THE CHLORIDE OF CALCIUM TUBE AND TLHE WEIGHTS WERE THEN DETERMINED IT WAS FOUND THAT FROM 45687 GRAINS OF THE HYDRATED OXIDE THERE WERE OBTAINED 33532 GRAINS OF METAL AND 11298 GRAINS OF WATER GIVING 7395 FOR THE FORMER AND 2474 FOR THE LATTER PER CENT BUT OF THIS 2474 THERE WERE FORMED 1249 BY MEANS OF 11 10 OF OXYGEN WHICH HAD BEEN COMBINED WITH THE METAL AND THE WATER OF HYDRA TION AMOUNTED THEREFORE TO BUT 1225 PER CENT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TOTAL VOLATILE MATTER AND THE WATER 317 PER CENT MAY BE CERTAINLY CONSIDERED AS CARBONIC ACID FROM THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THE SUBSTANCE IS PREPARED AND FIOMN THE FACT THAT IT IN ALL CASES EFFERVESCES SLIGHTLY WHEN DISSOLVED IN MURIATIC ACID WE MAY SUM UP THEREFORE THE COMPOSITION OF THIS TRUE BASIC CARBONATE OF PALLA DIUM AS FOLLOWS  LAST EXPERIMENT MEAN OF A B C D PALLADIUM   7395 7260 OXYGEN    1063 1198 WATER    12251 CARBONIC ACID  3 17 10000 10000 THE FORMULA DEDUCIBLE FROM THESE RESULTS IS 10 PD 0  C 02  10 H O WHICH GIVES THE FOLLOWING NUMERICAL RESULT TEN ATOMS OF PALLADIUM  5330 7352 TEN ATOMS OF OXYGEN  80O0 1104 TEN ATOMS OF WATER   900 1241 ONE ATOM OF CARBONIC ACID   220 303 7250 10000OF PALL2ADIUM AND PLATINUM 2 IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE BUT THIS BODY MAY BE IN REALITY A MIXTURE OF A LESS BASIC CARBONATE WITH THE TRUE HYDRATED OXIDE BUT I CONSIDER THAT THE REMARKABLE CONSTANCYOF COMPO SITION INDICATED BY SO MANY SPECIMENS PREPARED AT DIFFERENT TIMES GIVING RESULTS SO CLOSELY COINCIDING ARGUES VERY STRONGLY IN FAVOUR OF ITS DEFINITE NATURE IT OCCURRED TO ME ALSO THAT THE CONTENT IN CARBONIC ACID MIGHT ARISE FROM THE PRESENCE OF CARBONATE OF SODABUT I SATISFIED MYSELF THAT ALTHOUGH IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN SPECIMENSWHICH DO NOT AFTER IGNITION YIELD TRACES OF ALKALI YET IT IS NEVER PRESENT IN SUCH QUANTITY AS COULD GIVE THE ABOVE RESULTSWHEN THEFRESHLY PRECIPITATED SUBSTANCE HAS BEEN PROPERLYWASHED THE PROPERTIES OF THE SUBOXIDE OF PALLADIUM NOW FIRST DEFINITELY FOUND ARE NOT VERY DISTINCT THE EXISTENCE OF THIS SUBOXIDE HAD BEEN LONG SUSPECTED ESPECIALLY FROM THE FACT THAT BY HEATING TO DULL REDNESS IN CONTACT WITH AIR METALLIC PALLADIUM BECOMES COLOURED BLUE OR GREEN ON THE SURFACE WHICH COLOURS ARE REMOVED BY VIOLENT IGNITION BERZELIUS FOUND HOWEVER THAT THIS COLOURING WAS NOT ATTENDED WITH ANY INCREASE OF WEIGHT WHICH ARISES HOWEVET FIOM THE MINUTE QUANTITY OF OXIDE FORMED THE COLOURS BEING THOSE OF THIN PLATES BUT THERE CAN BE NOW NO DOUBT BUT THAT FOR MATION OF SUBOXIDE DOES SO OCCUR THAT THE BLACK POWDER WHICH IS LEFT BY THE DULL IGNITION OF THE BASIC CARBONATE IS REALLY A DEFINITE COMPOUND IS STRONGLY SUPPORTED BY THE FACT OF THE ACCURACY WITH WHICH THE DECOMPOSITION STOPS AT ITS FORMATION AND BY THE ANALOGY OF THE SUBCHLORIDE TO BE HEREAFTER DESCRIBED IT GAINS ADDITIONAL FORCE YET I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO COMBINE IN ANY WAY THIS SUBOXIDE WITH ACIDS BY CON TACT WITH THEM IT GIVES AN ORDINARY SALT OF THE PROTOXIDE AND METAL IT IS POSSIBLE HOWEVER THAT IN FUTURE TRIALS I MAY BE MORE SUCCESSFUL IT IS KNOWN THAT BY THE ADDITION OF A CAUSTIC FIXED ALKALI TO A SALT OF PALLADIUM A PRECIPITATE IS OBTAINED WHICH REDISSOLVES IN A GREAT EXCESS OF THE ALKALI THE PRECI PITATE IS IN THIS CASE A BASIC SALT NOT THE HYDRATED OXIDE AND ALWAYS CONTAINS TRACES OF THE ALKALI FROM WHICH IT IS WITH DIFFICULTY FREED BY WASHING THE SOLUBLE ALKALINE COMPOUND CANNOT BE OBTAINED IN A DEFINITE FORM BY ANY PROCESS THAT I HAVE AS YET TRIED BY EVAPORATION TO DRYNESS THE OXIDE SEPARATES ANHYDROUS AND RETAINING A SMALL QUANTITY OF ALKALI WHEN THE BASIC CARBONATE OF PALLADIUM HYDRATED OXIDE IS DIFFUSED THROUGH WATER OF AMMONIA IT PARTIALLY DISSOLVES GIVING A BROWN POWDER AND A YELLOWCOLOURED LIQUOR WHICH WHEN EVAPORATED DRIES DOWN TO A BRIGHT YELLOW DELIQUESCENT MASS WHEN HEATED THIS DECOMPOSES WITH SLIGHT DEFLAGRATION AND COPIOUS DISENGAGEMENT OF GAS LEAVING METALLIC PALLADIUM THE BROWN POWDER ALSO CONTAINS AMMONIA AND WHEN HEATED GIVES IT OFF WITH WATER AND THE METAL IS REDUCED I CAN HOWEVER AT PRESENT ONLY INDICATE THE EXISTENCE OF THESE TWO BODIES AS THE ANALYTICAL RESULTS WHICH I HAVE OBTAINED RESPECTING THEM ARE TOO DISCORDANT TO ADMIT OF MY ASSIGNING ANY DEFINITE FORMULAE FOR THEIR CONSTITUTION THE SOLUBLE COMPOUND I CONCEIVE TO ARISE FROM THE AMMONIA ACTING ON THE CARBONATE AS IT DOES ON ANY OTHER PALLADIUM SALT AND THE INSOLUBLE TO BE THE PRODUCT OF THE AMMONIA ON THE OXIDE WHICH IS PRESENT IN EXCESS I RESERVE THESE BODIES THEREFORE AS OBJECTS OF FUTURE STUDY 279DR KANE ON THE CHEMICAL HISTORY CHLORIDES OF PALLADIUM THE PROPERTIES OF THE ORDINARY PROTOCHLORIDE OF PALLADIUM HAVE BEEN FOR THE MOST PART SO FULLY DESCRIBED BY THOSE CHEMISTS THAT HAVE PREVIOUSLY OCCUPIED THEMSELVES WITH THE STUDY OF THIS METAL THAT I SHALL NOTICE IT BUT BRIEFLY FROM A STRONG SOLUTION IT CRY STALLIZES IN PRISMATIC NEEDLES WHICH ARE VERY DELIQUESCENT THESE CRYSTALS WERE FOUND TO CONTAIN TWO ATOMS OF WATER OF CRYSTALLIZATION WHICH THEY LOSE BY A GENTLE HEAT THE ACTION OF A HIGH TEMPERATURE ON PROTOCHLORIDE OF PALLADIUM DEVELOPES SONME FACTS OF CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IT IS NOT SO REDUCED TO THE METALLIC STATE UNLESS BY VERY VIOLENT IGNITION BUT JUST AT A RED HEAT IT MELTS AND BEGINS TO EVOLVE CHLORINE WHICH CONTINUES UNTIL IT HAS PARTED WITH ONEHALF OF THAT WHICH IT CONTAINS THE LIQUEFIED MASS WHICH REMAINS IS A TRUE SUBCHLORIDE WHICH IS NOT FURTHLER ACTED UPON UNLESS THE HEAT BE VERY MUCH INCREASED THE FOLLOWING NUMERICAL RESULTS WILL RENDER THIS DECOMPOSITION EVIDENT A 29881 GRAINS OF THE CRYSTALLIZED PROTOCHLORIDE BEING CAREFULLY DRIED AS LONG AS THEY GAVE OFF ANY TRACES OF WATERY VAPOUR WERE FOUND TO HAVE LOST 5247 GRAINS OR 1756 PER CENT THE DRIED MASS WAS HEATED UNTIL IT HAD COMPLETELY FUSED IT WAS THEN DULL RED IN THIS STATE IT WAS FOUND TO WEIGH 22055 GRAINS HAVING GIVEN OFF 2X577 GRAINS OF CHLORINE OR 863 PER CENT THIS WAS NEXT KEPT MELTED AT A BRIGHT RED HEAT UNTIL IT APPEARED TO CEASE GIVING OFF ANY GAS IT THEN WEIGHED 19632 GRAINS HAVING LOST IN ADDITION 2423 GRAINS OR 8 11 PER CENT OF CHLORINE THIS RESIDUE WAS NOW FULLY IGNITED WITH SOME CARBONATE OF ARNMMONIA UNTIL THE METALLIC PALLADIUM REMAINING APPEARED TO BE QUITE PURE THIS THEN WEIGHED 14554 GRAINS OR 4871 PER CENT THE QUANTITY OF CHLORINE ABANDONED IN THIS FINAL STAGE HAVING BEEN 5078 GRAINS OR 1699 PER CENT THE QUANTITY OF PALLADIUM AND THE TOTAL QUANTITY OF CHLORINE AND WATER SHOW THAT THE SALT IN ITS CRYSTALLINE CONDITION HAS THE FORM ULA PD CL  2 H 0 BY WHICH WE HAVE THEORY EXPERIMENT PALLADIUM   533 4995 4871 CHLORINE   354 3318 3373 WATER   180 1687 1756 1067 10000 100 00 THE RELATION BETWEEN THE PROPORTIONS OF CHLORINE WHICH WERE EVOLVED AT THE DIFFER ENT PERIODS WERE AS 811 863 AND 1699 I DO NOT ATTACH MUCH IMPORTATCE TO THE TWO FIRST BEING SO NEARLY EQUAL BUT TO THE FACT THAT THE QUANTITY WHICH WAS NOT EX PELLED BY THE HEAT WAS SENSIBLY EQUAL TO HALF THE TOTAL QUANTITY IN THE SALT B 58919 GRAINS OF DRIED PROTOCHLORIDE WERE HEATED IN A PORCELAIN CRUCIBLE TO FULL REDNESS UNTIL IT FUSED WITHOUT ANY DISENGAGEMENT OF GAS THE RESIDUAL SUBCHLORIDE WEIGHED 47782 GRAINS OR 8113 PER CENT 280OP PALLADIUM AND PLATINUM C 138397 GRAINS WERE FUSED IN A PORCELAIN CRUCIBLE AND KEPT AT A FULL RED HEAT UNTIL ALL EFFERVESCENCE FROM LOSS OF CHLORINE CEASED WHEN COLD IT WEIGHED 110185 GRAINS EQUIVALENT TO 8041 PER CENT THESE RESULTS FULLY PROVE THAT THE LOSS OF CHLORINE WHICH THE PROTOCHLORIDE UNDER GOES WHEN KEPT FOR SOME TIME FUSED AT A FULL RED HEAT IS PERFECTLY DEFINITE AND ALSO THAT THE LOSS REPRESENTS ONEHALF OF THE CHLORINE WHICH THE SALT CONTAINS THUS BY THEORY PD2  1066 PRODUCE PD2  1066 CL2  708 PRODUCE CL  354 1774 1420 OR 8005 PER CENT THE SUBSTANCE FORMED IS A TRUE SUBCHLORIDE ANALOGOUS TO CALOMEL OR TO SUBCHLORIDE OF COPPER AND ITS FORMULA IS PD2 CL THE FUSED MASS OBTAINED BY THE METHODS NOW DESCRIBED IS OF A DEEP RED BROWN COLOUR AND HIGHLY CRYSTALLINE IN STRUCTURE ITS POWDER IS LIGHT RED IT DELIQUESCES RAPIDLY AND BECOMES DARKCOLOURED FROM THE SEPARATION OF METALLIC PALLADIUM AND THE FORMATION OF PROTOCHLORIDE THIS CHANGE IS EFFECTED ALMOST INSTANTLY BY CONTACT WITH WATER OR SOLUTIONS OF SALAMMONIAC OR IODIDE OF POTASSIUM ALSO BY WATER OF AMMONIA IT IS HOWEVER NOT ALL DECOMPOSED THE QUANTITY OF METALLIC PALLADIUM WHICH SEPARATES I HAVE FOUND TO BE BUT FROM ONEFIFTH TO ONESIXTH OF THAT WHICH THE SUBCHLORIDE CONTAINED THE LIQUOR FORMED CONTAINS THEREFORE BOTH THE SUBCHLORIDE AND THE PROTOCHLORIDE DISSOLVED TOGETHER THE ACTION OF REAGENTS ON THIS LIQUOR HOWEVER DOES NOT DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THAT PRODUCED WITH SOLUTIONS OF THE PROTO CHLORIDE THE LIQUOR IS MUCH DARKER COLOURED THAN A SOLUTION OF PROTOCHLORIDE OF THE SAME STRENGTH SHOULD BE AND IS RENDERED TURBID BY DILUTION WITH MORE WATER THE FIRST ACTION OF AMMONIA APPEARS TO BE THE FORMATION OF A WHITE COMPOUND WHICH IS HOWEVER ALMOST INSTANTLY BROKEN UP INTO THE PINKISH AMMONIAPROTOCHLLORIDE AND METALLIC PALLADIUM IN THE DOUBLLE SALTS FORMED BY THE PROTOCHLORIDE OF PALLADIUM WITH THE CHLORIDES OF THE ALKALINE METALS I HAVE FOUND THE SIMILARITY OF CONSTITUTION SO USUAL BETWEEN THE COMPOUNDS OF AMMNONIUMN AND POTASSIUM TO BE VIOLATED THE DOUBLE CHLORIDE OF PALLADIUM AND POTASSIUM HAS BEEN FULLY SHOWN BY BERZELIUS TO HAVE THE FORMULA PD CL  K C1 AND NOT TO CONTAIN ANY WATER OF CRYSTALLIZATION BUT THE DOUBLE CHLORIDE OF PALLADIUM AND AMMONIUM RETAINS AN ATOM OF WATER WHEN CRYSTALLIZED I EXAMINED A QUANTITY OF THIS SALT WHICH HAD FORMED LONG RECTANGULAR PRISMS OF AN OLIVE COLOUR WITH A RICH BRONZE LUSTRE THEY WERE QUITE FREE FROM ANY FOREIGN IMPU RITIES WHEN HEATED THEY YIELDED WATER MURIATIC ACID SALAMMONIAC AND LEFT ME TALLIC PALLADIUM BY A VERY CAUTIOUS APPLICATION OF HEAT THE WATER MAY BE COMPLETELY EXPELLED FROM MANY EXPERIMENTS ITS QUANTITY WAS FOUND TO BE FROM 552 TO 595 PER CENT MDCCCXLII 2O 281DR KANE ON THE CHEMICAL HISTORY AND THE RESIDUAL PALLADIUM WAS ASCERTAINED TO BE FROM 3556 TO 3527 IN 100 OF THE CRYSTALS THESE NUMBERS INDICATE THE FORMULA PD CL  N H4CL  H 0 WHICH GIVES PD  533 3528 C1L  708 4686 NH4  180 1191  90 595 1511 10000 IF THE SALT WERE ANHYDROUS IT SHOULD YIELD 37551 PER CENT OF METAL IT IS ONLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF ITS DIFFERING FIOM THE POTASSIUM SALT THAT I DEEM THIS BODY WORTHY OF NOTICE HERE OF THE OXYCHLORIDE OF PALLADIUM WHEN A SOLUTION OF CHLORIDE OF PALLADIUM IS PARTIALLY PRECIPITATED BY MEANS OF A SOLUTION OF POTASH OR OF SODA CARE BEING TAKEN THAT THE METALLIC CHLORIDE SHALL STILL BE PRESENT IN CONSIDERABLE EXCESS A DARK BROWN POWDER IS OBTAINED WHICH IS A DEFI NITE OXYCHLORIDE OF PALLADIUM WHEN DRIED IN A STOVE AT A TEMPERATURE OF 150 ITS PROPERTIES ARE AS FOLLOWSIF IT BE HEATED IT GIVES OFF WATER AND AT A FULL RED HEAT CHLORINE AND OXYGEN LEAVING BE HIND A MIXTURE OF SUBCHLORIDE SUBOXIDE AND METAL IT DISSOLVES IN DILUTE ACIDS GIVING A MIXTURE OF PROTOCHLORIDE AND AN ORDINARY PALLADIUM SALT OF THE ACID USED ITS ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED AS FOLLOWS A 40 639 GRAINS FUSED WITH CARBONATE OF SODA AND THE SALINE MASS DISSOLVED IN WATER LEFT 28508 GRAINS OF PALLADIUM PURELY METALLIC BEING EQUAL TO 6980 PER CENT THE SOLUTION ACIDULATED BY NITRIC ACID AND PRECIPITATED BY NITRATE OF SILVER GAVE 18A103 GRAINS OF CHLORIDE OF SILVER OR 4455 PER CENT CONTAINING 10 99 OF CHLORINE B 67543 GRAINS OF ANOTHER SPECIMEN WERE HEATED OVER A SPIRITLAMP AS LONG AS ANY WATERY VAPOUR CAME OFF BUT NOT SO HIGH AS TO EXPEL ANY TRACES OF CHLORINE OR OXYGEN THE DRY MASS WHICH REMAINED WEIGHED 59977 GRAINS BEING 8862 PER CENT THE LOSS OF WATER HAD THUS BEEN 11 38 PER CENT THIS DRY RESIDUE WAS THEN VIVIDLY IGNITED AND A LUMP OF CARBONATE OF AMMONIA IN TRODUCED TO FAVOUR THE SEPARATION OF THE CHLORINE THE METALLIC PALLADIUM WHICH REMAINED WEIGHED 47442 GRAINS OR 7025 PER CENT THESE RESULTS LEAD TO THE FORMULA PD CL  3 PD O  4 H O WHICH GIVES THEORY EXPERIMENT A EXPERIMENT B 4 PD  2132 6910

PALLADIUM IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT ON ADDING WATER OF AMMONIA TO A SOLUTION OF CHLORIDE OF PAL LADIUM A PINKCOLOURED PRECIPITATE IS PRODUCED WHICH BY BOILING DISSOLVES GIVING A BROWNISH YELLOW LIQUOR FROM WHICH ON COOLING A CRYSTALLINE YELLOW SUBSTANCE SEPA RATES THESE TWO BODIES HAVE THE SAME PER CENT COMPOSITION EXPRESSED BY THE FORMULA PD C1  N H3 OF THIS I NEED NOT DETAIL ANY EVIDENCE AS IT HAS BEEN FULLY ESTABLISHED BY THE LABOURS OF BERZELIUS AND QUITE RECENTLY BY THE EXPERIMENTS OF FEHLING BY MEANS OF AN EXCESS OF AMMONIA THE PINK RED PRECIPITATE WHICH FIRST FORMS MAY BE TOTALLY REDISSOLVED GIVING A COLOURLESS SOLUTION FROM WHICH BY EVAPORATION A SALT IS DEPOSITED ON COOLING IN COLOURLESS RECTANGULAR PRISMS THE EXISTENCE OF THIS SALT HAS BEEN LONG KNOWN AND AS ITS ANALYSIS HAS BEEN RECENTLY PUBLISHED BY FEHLING I NEED NOT DETAIL ANY OF MY OWN EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS WHICH FULLY COINCIDE WITH HIS THE FORMULA OF THIS BODY IS PD C1  2 N H3  H 0 OR RATIONALLY ACCORDING TO THE PRINCIPLES I HAVE ELSEWHERE LAID DOWN FOR THE COPPER SALTS N H4  CL  PD 0 N H3 WHEN GENTLY HEATED IT EVOLVES WATER AND AMMONIA AND LEAVES THE YELLOW SUBSTANCE PD C1  N H3 THE SAME DECOMPOSITION MAY BE EFFECTED BY EVAPORATING ITS SOLU TION TO DRYNESS IN WHICH CASE THE YELLOW SALT GENERALLY CRYSTALLIZES IN CUBES WERE IT NOT HAZARDOUS TO DRAW ANY INFERENCE WITH REGARD TO THE ISOMORPHISM OF BODIES BE LONGING TO THE REGULAR SYSTEM I SHOULD NOTICE THIS FACT AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE EQUIVA LENCY OF PD CL  N H3 WITH K BY A VERY CAUTIOUS APPLICATION OF HEAT TO THE COLOUR LESS CRYSTALLIZED SALT SOME WATER MAY BE EXPELLED BEFORE THE AMMONIA BEGINS TO COME OFF BUT I HAVE NEVER SUCCEEDED IN RENDERING IT QUITE ANHYDROUS IT HOWEVER PARTIALLY ASSUMES THE FORMULA N H4 CL  PD N H2 TO WHICH WE SHALL FIND THE AMMONIA SULPHATE OF PALLADIUM TO PRESENT AN EQUIVALENT BY THE ACTION OF SOLUTIONS OF CAUSTIC POTASH ON SOLUTIONS OF THESE AMMONIACHLORIDES OF PALLADIUM A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS ARE FORMED ACCORDING TO THE PROPORTIONS EMPLOYED AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF TEMPERATURE FOR THE COMPLETE INVESTIGATION OF THESE BO DIES I HAVE NOT YET ACCUMULATED MATERIALS BUT THE RESULTS WHICH HAVE BEEN ALREADY OBTAINED ARE NOT WITHOUT INTEREST AS INDICATIVE OF THE ANALOGIES OF PALLADIUM TO OTHER METALS WHOSE LAWS OF COMBINATION ARE BETTER KNOWN I SHALL CONSEQUENTLY DESCRIBE THOSE SUBSTANCES I HAVE AS YET EXAMINED ALTHOUGH I INTEND TO RESUME AND EXTEND THEIR INVESTIGATION BEFORE LONG A WHEN THE PINKRED PRECIPITATE IS BOILED WITH A LARGE QUANTITY OF WATER IT DIS SOLVES AND ON COOLING BUT LITTLE OF THE ISOMERIC YELLOW SALT CRYSTALLIZES OUT ON ADDING TO THE BROWNISH YELLOW LIQUOR SO OBTAINED A SOLUTION OF CAUSTIC POTASH NOT IN EXCESS A YELLOWISH PRECIPITATE FALLS WHICH BY BOILING BECOMES BROWN RED AND DISTINCTLY CRYSTALLINE IF THE PINK RED SUBSTANCE PD CL  N H3 BE DISSOLVED IN THE HOT WATER WITHOUT MUCH BOILING THERE IS GENERALLY NO PRECIPITATE ON ADDING THE CAUSTIC POTASH AND THE SOLUTION IS MERELY YELLOW NOT BROWNISH COLOURED IT APPEARS NECESSARY THAT BY THE BOILING PARTIAL DECOMPOSITION SHOULD OCCUR AND SOME AMMONIA BE EX 2O2 283DR KANE ON THE CHEMICAL HISTORY PELLED TO BRING THE LIQUOR TO THE STATE SUITABLE FOR THE ACTION OF THE CAUSTIC POTASH THIS MAY ALSO BE EFFECTED BY ADDING TO THE SOLUTION OF THE AMMONIACHLORIDE SOME SOLUTION OF PROTOCHLORIDE OF PALLADIUM SO AS TO HAVE IN SOLUTION APPARENTLY A SUB STANCE CONTAINING PD CL  PD CL  N H3 WHICH IS NOT KNOWN IN THE SOLID FORM THE YELLOW PRECIPITATE WHICH FIRST FALLS IS THE ORDINARY CRYSTALLINE BODY PDCL  NH3 BUT BY BOILING IN THE LIQUOR FROM WHICH IT HAS SEPARATED ITS NATURE IS COMPLETELY CHANGED THE PROPERTIES OF THE CRYSTALLINE BROWN RED SUBSTANCE THEN PRODUCED ARE THAT IT DISSOLVES READILY IN MURIATIC ACID AND GIVES BY HEAT SALAMMONIAC NITROGEN AND WATER AND LEAVES METALLIC PALLADIUM ITS COMPOSITION WAS DETERMINED BY ANA LYSIS TO BE AS FOLLOWS I 14601 GRAINS HAVING BEEN IGNITED TO PERFECT FUSION WITH CARBONATE OF

SOMRE PIECES OF PLATINA FOIL BEING INTER POSED ABOUT FOUR INCHES OF THE TUBE IN FIONT OF THE MIXTURE WERE FILLED WITH OXIDE OF COPPER TO THIS APPARATUS WAS ADAPTED A TUBE CONTAINING RECENTLY FUSED CHLORIDE OF CALCIUM AND THE WHOLE BEING DISPOSED AND HEATED EXACTLY AS FOR AN ORGANIC ANALYSIS IT YIELDED 3212 GRAINS OF WATER BEING 3478 PER CENT CONTAINING 385 OF HYDROGEN AFTER THIS OPERATION THE TUBE BEING CUT BY A FILE THAT PORTION OF IT WHICH CONTAINED THE SALINE MASS WAS DIGESTED WITH DILUTE NITRIC ACID AND THE METALLIC PALLADIUM COL LECTED ON A FILTER IT WEIGHED 5170 GRAINS OR 5602 PER

100 2 1963 GRAINS GAVE BY IGNITION WITH OXIDE OF COPPER 6745 OF WATER INDICATING 341 OF HYDROGEN PER CENT ANOTHER PORTION DRIED AT A HIGHER TEMPERATURE AND SIMILARLY TREATED GAVE 334 OF HYDROGEN IN 100 33 478 GRAINS GAVE 14 8295 CUBIC INCHES OF PURE NITROGEN AT 30 BAROMETER AND 320 FAHR AMOUNTING TO 1421 PER CENT THE FORMULA TO WHICH THIS ANALYSIS POINTS IS PT2 C3 N4 H13 OG FROM WHICH TTLE NUMBERS FOLLOW TWO EQUIVALENTS OF PLATINUM  1976 5077 THREE EQUIVALENTS OF CHLORINE  1062 2729 FOUR EQUIVALENTS OF NITROGEN  564 1449 THIRTEEN EQUIVALENTS OF HYDROGEN 130 334 TWO EQUIVALENTS OF OXYGEN   160 411 3892 10000 THE RELATION OF THIS SUBSTANCE TO THAT LAST DESCRIBED IS EASILY TO BE SEEN IT CON SISTS IN THE UNION OF ONE EQUIVALENT OF MURIATIC ACID TO TWO EQUIVALENTS OF GROSS BASE IT WOULD INDEED UPON THE PRINCIPLES OF THAT CHEMIST STAND IN THE SINGULAR POSITION OF AN OXYCHLORIDE OF HIS COMPOUND RADICAL FOR IT IS EVIDENT THAT PT CL N2 H6 0  PT CL N2 H CL  PT2 CL3 N4 1H12 0 2 AQ EVIDENTLY THE MANNER OF FORMATION OF THIS SUBSTANCE IS THE EXPULSION OF ATNMMONIA FROM GRONSS BASE BY THE TENM PERATURE OF EBULLITION AND THE SUBSEQUENT COMBINATION OF THE SALAMMONIAC OF THE LIQUOR WITH THE BODY SO EVOLVED THUS PT2 C12 N4 H12 02 LOSING N H3 BECOMES PT2 CL2 N3 119 02 AND BY THE ADDITION OF N 114 C FORMS THE BODY IN QUESTION PT2 C13 N4 H13 02 I HAVE NOT HITHERTO STOPPED TO CONSIDER THE PRECISE MANNER IN WHICH THESE SEVERAL BODIES ARE DERIVED FROM EACH OTHER OR FROMT THE CHLORIDE OF PLATINUM AND IN ORDER TO SEE MORE CLEARLY THEIR NATURAL RELATIONS IT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE THE CHANGE ALREADY NOTICED IN THE COMMLENCEMENT OF THIS PAPER AMMONIA BEING AMIDIDE OF HYDROGEN AND NOTHING OCCURRING IN THE CHAIN OF REACTIONS NOW STUDIED TO DISTURB ITS CONSTITU TION I SHALL FOR THE FUTURE LOOK UPON THE NITROGEN AS EXISTING IN THE STATE OF AMIDO GENE AND THE FORMULAE ALREADY DESCRIBED BECOME THEN AS FOLLOWS A PTCI2N H3  PT CL2 AD H B PT2 CL5 N2 H1 04  PT2 C15 AD2 H7 04 C PT2 C1 N3 H1004  PT2 C1 AD3 H404 D PTCIN21H803 PTCLAD2H403 E PT2 C3 N4 H13 02  PT2 C13 AD4 H5 02 306OP PALLADIUM AND PLATINUM IF WE WERE DISPOSED TO CONSIDER THAT THE PRINCIPLE WHICH WAS FOUND SO REMARKABLY DISPLAYED IN THE INSTANCE OF THE MERCURIAL COMPOUNDS HELD WITH PLATINUM AND THAT IN THOSE INSTANCES WHERE OXYGEN WAS PRESENT IT SHOULD BE LOOKED UPON AS EXISTING IN THE STATE OF WATER WE MIGHT FIND HERE NUMEROUS ADDITIONS TO THE CLASS OF METALLIC ARNIDIDES THUS THE BODY C SHOULD BECOME DOUBLING THE FORMULA ABOVE WRITTEN PT CL2  3 PT AD2  8 H 0 AND SIMILARLY WITH THE OTHERS BUT IT IS EXCEEDINGLY DIF FICULT TO SAY WHEN PT 02 AND 2 AD H ACT ON ONE ANOTHER WHETHER THEY UNITE DIRECTLY OR WHETHER THEY MUTUALLY DECOMPOSE FORMING PT AD2 AND 2 H 0 WHICH THEN UNITE THIS DIFFICULTY EXISTS IN ALL CASES WHERE THE WATER CANNOT BE SEPARATED WITHOUT THE SUB STANCE BEING COMPLETELY DECOMPOSED I WOULD POSTPONE FOR THE MOMENT THE CONSI DERATION OF TLLIS POINT AND FOR THE TIME AT LEAST LOOK UPON THE HYDROGEN AS BEING EQUALLY ESSENTIAL WITH THE PLATINUM AS A CONSTITUENT OF THESE BODIES THE FORMATION OF THE FIRST SUBSTANCE DESCRIBED REQUIRES NO REMARK I FIND THAT THE SAME BODY MAY BE PRODUCED BY THE ACTION OF DRY AMMONIACAL GAS UPON CHLORIDE OF PLATINUM THERE IS ABSORBED ABOUT 11 OR 12 PER CENT INDICATING ONE EQUIVALENT PT CL2  AD H BUT IF THE CURRENT OF GAS BE CONTINUED A WHITE POWDER IS OBTAINED FORMED BY THE UNION OF TWO EQUIVALENTS OF AMMONIA TO ONE OF PLATINUM AND WHICH IS IDENTICAL WITH THE MURIATIC SALT OF GROS OF WHICH THE FORMULA MAY BE SIMPLY WRITTEN PT C12  2 AD H IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE BODY B CANNOT BE PRODUCED DIRECTLY FROM THE PERCHLORIDE OF PLATINUM AS THAT DOES NOT CONTAIN THE QUANTITY OF CHLORINE NECESSARY FOR ITS CONSTITU TION AND INDEED IF WE EXAMINE THE AMMONIACAL LIQUOR FROM THE FIRST COMMENCEMENT OF THE FORMATION OF THE FAWNCOLOURED SUBSTANCE IT WILL YIELD THE BODY D ON THE AD DITION OF ALCOHOL I CONSIDER THEREFORE THESE TWO BODIES AS BEING OF SIMULTANEOUS ORIGIN THERE BEING FORMED FROM 3 PT CI2 WITH 4 AD H AND 7 H O PT2 C15 AD2 H7 04 AND PT C1 AD2 H4 03 FROM THE FAWNCOLOURED SUBSTANCE B THE BROWN BODY C MAY BE SIMPLY FORMNED FOUR EQUIVALENTS OF MURIATIC ACID BEING REMOVED AND ONE OF AMMONIA GIVEN IN THEIL PLACE THIS IS NOT EQUIVALENT SUBSTITUTION BUT IT STILL SHOWS THE ORIGIN OF THE BODY IF HOWEVER THE FAWNCOLOURED SUBSTANCE ALL PASSED THROUGH THE BROWN CONDITION THE QUANTITY OF THIS LAST GENERATED SHOULD I CONSIDER BE MUCH GREATER THAN IT ACTUALLY IS FOUND TO BE AND HENCE I AM INCLINED TO CONSIDER THAT FROM TWO ATOMS OF B   PT4 CL1 AD4 4 1 PT4 CLI AD14 H2 O AND TEN ATOMS OF AMMONIA ADLO H O THERE ARE FORMED ONE ATOM OF C PT CL AD3 4 04  TWO OF GROSS BASE DRY  PT2 C12 AD4 H8 04 PT4 CLL AD14 H12 O8 SEVEN OF SALAMMONIAC

FAWNCOLOURED SUBSTANCE AS FOLLOWS ONE ATOM OF B  PT2 CL5 AD H7 04 PT2 C15 AD7 H12 04 FIVE OF AMMONIA  AD5 H5S PRODUCE TWO ATOMS OF GROSS BASE  PT2 CL2 AD4 H6 041 PT C1 AD7 H THREE ATOMS OF SALAMMONIAC

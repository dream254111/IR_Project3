graduate student in the Department of Biology of Princeton University A short summary of the earlier findings has been published in a former article I4 The study of additional material and the completion of the present paper has been carried out in the zoological laboratory in the College of Liberal Arts of Syracuse University during the last year To Dr E G Conklin who first suggested this in vestigation to me I wish to express my thanks for his interest and for the many suggestions made at various times during the course of this study I am also indebted to Dr C W Hargitt for many favors during the latter part of my work The ability of certain rotifers tardigrades and nematode worms to withstand periods of desiccation has been a subject of investi gation for many biologists throughout a period of more than two hundred years The first recorded observations upon desic cation phenomena are those of von Leeuwenhoek in 170I From the gutter of a roof he took some dust which he moistened and examined with his microscope He observed living animals swimming about actively in the water He found that the animals which were no doubt rotifers could be deprived of moisture for many months and could then be revived by the addition of water After the work of von Leeuwenhoek the problem of the drying of living things was forgotten for a time It was not until the period between 1750 and 1775 that interest in the study of desiccation phenomena was revived During this quarter century many forms were added to the list of animals capable of enduring desiccation In 1776 Spallanzani discovered certain tardigrades and nema todes which were able to endure desiccation He worked also on rotifers and was the first to state that rotifers when dried free from sand could not recover from the effects of the drying process The failure of Spallanzanis rotifers to recover has since been shown to be in no way due to the absence of sand but his experiments aroused much discussion and engaged the atten tion of many of the foremost naturalists of that day 344DESICCATION IN PHILODINA ROSEOLA Ehrenberg I838 maintained that the presence of sand pro tected the rotifers from an actual loss of water He believed that during the apparent desiccation period all of the vital processes continued reproduction included In regard to the function of the sand in retarding desiccation he differed from Spallanzani since the latter believed that the sand protected the rotifer from the injurious effects of the air rather than from loss of water Bory St Vincent about this time maintained that under no conditions could the animals survive desiccation but that their apparent revival was due to the hatching of eggs concealed in the sand Doyere I842 after careful study confirmed in the main the observations of Spallanzani Doyere found however that a few rotifers recovered in each lot dried on a clean slide He dis proved the theory of Spallanzani as to the fatal effects of the air since he found that rotifers dried in air and then placed in a vacuum showed a lower mortality than those dried directly in the vacuum He concluded that the rapidity of drying is an important factor in the effects of desiccation He decided from his experiments with rotifers in vacua that the last traces of water might be extracted without destroying the power of re vival and that since life processes are impossible in the absence of water the dried animal possessed life poentially and not actually About I86o a more general interest in the subject of desiccation was revived The advocates and opponents of the view that desiccation occurs were so evenly divided and the evidence for both views apparently so well founded that the arguments for and against desiccation were considered in 1859 by a commission appointed by the Societe de Biologie of France It was the opinion of this commission that in the dried state life existed only in potentia Up to this time no one had suggested that rotifers might secrete a waterproof membrane during the dry season In I873 Davis said that in Philodina there was a secretion of a gelatinous covering which prevented loss of the body fluids He explained that the presence of sand prevented rapid evaporation of the water and thus gave the rotifers time to secrete the gelatinous 345LOUIS MAX HICKERNELL envelope before the last traces of moisture on the slide disap peared This conception has been widely accepted by many up to the present day Zacharias I886 and Faggioli I891 both reverted to the view of Bory St Vincent that the supposed revival was due to the hatching of eggs concealed in the sand From the time of Faggiolis paper until I909 no conclusive work on the subject of desiccation appeared It will at once be seen that the main questions involved in the desiccation prob lem had not been solved In I909 Jacobs working upon Philo dina roseola attempted to determine the real conditions attending the drying process Jacobs outlines the questions involved in the desiccation prob lem as follows What is the actual effect of drying on a rotifer Is the water really removed Does the animal secrete a pro tecting membrane If the animal actually dries what is the condition of its tissues Are life processes at a standstill or are metabolic activities going on all the time in a reduced state Jacobs concluded because of the shrinkage in the tissues be cause of negative results in physical and chemical tests for water in the dried animal and as a result of other indirect methods that the rotifer body becomes truly desiccated He found no evidence of a waterproof cyst His answer to the question regarding the condition of the tissues in the dried animal was not very definite at least not complete and this for the very good reason that he made no cytological examination of the tissues of the dried rotifers Jacobs decides that the metabolic changes probably continue in the tissues of dried rotifers In all the discussion and observation upon the subject of desic cation phenomena previous to the publication of the preliminary note on this work apparently no one had considered the problem from a cytological point of view This is true not only of the study of animal tissues but among plants as well Certain algae pteridophytes and liverworts can be dried and will subsequently recover This fact has been known for years Pfeifer I903 comments upon physiological phenomena attending desiccation but mentions no changes in structure The author published in I914 a preliminary account of the observations recorded in this paper Brown 1915 working with McDougal at the 346DESICCATION IN PHILODINA ROSEOLA Desert Laboratory at Tucson Ariz describes cytological changes accompanying desiccation and subsequent recovery in the cells of Echinocactus wislizeni These two papers as far as is known to the author comprise the literature on the cytology of desic cation Although this paper deals with the same kind of material as was used by Jacobs and although some of the questions asked by him are of most interest here the problem has been attacked from an entirely different angle and by cytological methods confirms and adds to the results of Jacobs which were obtained by physiological methods The purpose of this study is therefore to attempt by means of cytological examination to determine i the condition of the tissues of the dried rotifer 2 the presence or absence of a pro tecting membrane in the dried condition 3 the condition of metabolic activity in the tissues of the dried animalsand 4 the changes attending a recovery from desiccation In order to do this it will be necessary to compare carefully the cytological appearance of sections of animals in a condition of dryness and those of animals recovering from desiccation with sections of the normal active animal From the data so gathered the con clusions will be drawn II MATERIAL AND METHODS Philodina roseola is one of the common rotifers belonging to the order Bdelloideae It occurs throughout the world and is found in depressions in rocks eave troughs or almost any place which is moist or periodically moist and dry It is usually associated with the unicellular alga Sphcerella lacustris Frequently one notices small individuals in hay infusions These are no doubt introduced when dry hay is added to old cultures Sometimes in infusions rotifers are found which are fully as large as those associated with the alga before mentioned These may be encouraged to multiply if very weak hay infusion is added from time to time The weak infusion allows sufficient bacteria to develop to replace the algae as food and it seems not to harm the animals As has been stated by other authors the behavior of P roseola is dependent upon a number of factors chief of which seem to 347LOUIS MAX HICKERNELL be the purity of the medium in which it lives the amount of food material present and the temperature of the medium If the water surrounding the animals does not contain too much organic material they usually may be seen stretched out fastened by the foot and going through the usual feeding movements When conditions are unfavorable they contract P1 II Fig 4 and remain quiet until the surroundings become more favorable A slight increase in temperature is usually conducive to more vigorous movements especially swimming In preparing P roseola for microscopic examination or subse quent sectioning some difficulty may be experienced because of the fact that the animals are generally associated with sand or other foreign material When the animals are present in suf ficient numbers the method of collection suggested by Jacobs is perhaps the best This takes advantage of the reaction of the animals to Tight If subjected to no mechanical stimulus they usually are indifferent to natural light of ordinary intensity However if the culture is violently agitated by shaking or stirring they become temporarily negatively phototropic and may be collected with a pipette from the darker part of the culture When it was desirable to select individuals of any given size or condition of maturity in these experiments or to get some absolutely free from foreign material this was accom plished by picking up the animals one by one from a Syracuse watch glass with a capillary pipette the entire process being watched with a binocular microscope The foregoing statement is not to be interpreted as meaning that P roseola is ever covered with debris Such is not the case The foreign material alluded to consists of bits of sand etc to which the animals adhere by means of the sticky secretion of the foot glands When first put on the slide under a cover glass the animals are generally so active that a single individual can be kept within the field of a high power lens only with greatest difficulty As some of the water evaporates from under the cover glass and as the latter gently presses upon the animal movements become less rapid and many details of organization can be made out with little trouble By putting the rotifer in a weak solution of neutral red some of the internal organs are stained but not with any particular 348DESICCATION IN PHILODINA ROSEOLA sharpness By proper manipulation of the light through the condenser the unstained specimen becomes practically as favor able for examination as that stained in neutral red In preparing dried animals for sectioning large numbers of active animals free from sand were put in Syracuse watch glasses and the latter placed in an oven at about 40 degrees Centigrade While the desiccation process is always fatal to a few animals in each lot which is being dried I can affirm what Jacobs has already pointed out namely that in the case of animals dried on clean glass the mortality is lowest when the temperature is about 40 degrees Centigrade and the moisture is not allowed to pass off too rapidly In preparing undried rotifers for sectioning a large number was collected in a test tube and anesthetized with the cocaine methylalcohol mixture of Rousellet When the animals were completely relaxed the excess liquid was drawn off and the fixing fluid poured upon the entire mass After fixation the material was washed thoroughly passed rapidly through the alcohols cleared in xylol and embedded in paraffine of 5456 degrees melting point Sections were cut 35 A in thickness In the case of the dried animals the fixative was poured directly upon them and allowed to act from twenty to thirty minutes Several fixing fluids were employed Bouins picroacetic formol was not very satisfactory A solution of saturated cor rosive sublimate with 5 per cent acetic acid was used hot This was quite satisfactory in that its action was almost instantaneous and the preservation of structures faithful in most respects Beauchamp o09 says that sublimate fixation was very poor in the forms he studied He does not state the exact formula employed in his experiments but it would appear that he did not try the one mentioned above By far the best formula for fixa tion is the osmicsublimatebichromate mixture recommended by Beauchamp In staining the sections ironalum haematoxylin combined with various counter stains gave the best results The ironhaemato xylineosinlichtgriin stain of Beauchamp is very valuable Another combination consisting of safranin orange G and licht griin was used with some success The latter is not so precise as the haematoxylin combination 349LOUIS MAX HICKERNELL OBSERVATIONS I On Entire Animals A Anatomy of P roseolaJanson 93 has carefully con sidered the anatomy of the Philodinidae and I find few inac curacies in his statements as applied to P roseola It will be necessary however to briefly describe the organ systems and their relationships in order to arrive at a thorough understanding of the changes in form and rearrangement of parts incident to the desiccation process The body of P roseola at first sight suggests that of a seg mented worm Its segmentation which affects only the integu ment and accessory structures is however not so regular but that the body is easily divided into head trunk and foot Its outer integument is formed of a thin more or less transparent cuticle beneath which is a granular plasma layer the hypodermis In the hypodermis are deposited pigment granules These are absent in the very young animal and occur in varying number in the adult The cuticle is soft and flexible easily lending itself to the telescoping and folding so characteristic of this Philodina The hypodermis is a syncytium which contains nuclei distri buted evenly through it There are in the midbody region longitudinal folds of the skin which are always present Tem porary cross foldings occur as a result of the vigorous movements of the animal Externally the skin lacks spines or protuberances of any kind The head whose most prominent structures are the trochal discs extends as far back as the forward margin of the mastax When the trochal discs are folded in a blunt ciliated projection is seen at the anterior end This is the proboscis and it is used for tactile purposes as well as to aid in the measuringworm type of locomotion so characteristic of the Bdelloideae The rotating organs consist of a double row of cilia broken in the case of the anterior row in the ventral part of the head The more posterior ciliary wreath is made up of shorter elements and is directly continuous with the cilia which line the pharangeal cavity The hypodermis in the head region at the base of the trochal discs is thickened probably to furnish additional support for the rotating apparatus and in some specimens the nuclei of this layer can be seen near the bases of the lines of cilia 350DESICCATION IN PHILODINA ROSEOLA Dorsally and arising at the posterior margin of the head is the tactile organ P1 I Fig I t o which shows from two to four segments according to its state of extension It is capped at the end by a tuft of short cilia Nerve fibers connect it with the brain as Zelinka has shown The brain Fig I br lies with its anterior margin just at the base of the tactile organ while it extends posteriorly slightly over the forward part of the mastax It is triangular in shape with the sharpest angle extending forward The eyes Fig I e which are red in color lie dorsal to the brain The excretory canals Fig 2 e c extend into the head and a terminal flame cell f c can sometimes be seen beating at the base of each trochal disc These flame cells are perhaps best seen when the trochal discs are folded in They appear very close to the margins of the folded discs PI II Fig 3 The trunk is almost entirely filled with the organs of digestion and those of reproduction In its most anterior part the mastax P1 I Fig i m is prominent Food enters this by way of the narrow ciliated pharanyx P1 I Fig 2 ph The mastax proper consists of two more or less crescentshaped jaws Trans verse ridges which at the inner margins continue as short pro jections form the teeth P1 I Fig i t In all the animals I have studied there have been two teeth on each jaw A few authors report cases where there are three teeth on one jaw and two on the other The mastax is surrounded by glands which probably contrib ute a digestive fluid to the food as it is being crushed in the mastax There are five of these salivary glands two of which lie dorsally and three ventrally The dorsal ones Fig i s g follow the outline of the mastax quite closely while those on the ventral side are usually larger and extend posteriorly Fig 2 s g In the living animal these glands show a granular cytoplasm with nuclei of varying sizes These nuclei appear as bright spots against the darker cytoplasmic background From the mastax a narrow esophagus leads to the stomach intestine P1 I Fig I st i In most cases it is difficult to see the esophagus in the living animal This is also true of a pair of glands which lie at the anterior end of the stomach 351LOUIS MAX HICKERNELL intestine Both the esophagus and these glands are obscured by the ventrally lying salivary glands and it is only when the animal is thoroughly stretched that these structures can be distinguished The stomachintestine as seen in the living animal consists of a yellow viscous tissue containing granules fatdroplets and nuclei By careful observation all of these elements may be recognized The lumen is usually not seen except in sections In healthy active animals the stomach tissue shows its color distinctly In starved animals the color is lacking in the stomach tissue as Zelinka has pointed out In newly hatched Philodina the stomach is almost perfectly transparent Just posterior to the stomachintestine is the blasendarm Fig I bl of Zelinka This is thickwalled but not glandular It serves for the accumulation of the undigested remains of the food By the contractions of its walls this material is evacuated from time to time Darker in color and more homogeneous in structure this first division of the end gut is the most prominent structure in the posterior part of the trunk of the living Philodina The blasendarm leads into the rectum Fig I r a nar rower tube in the dorsal wall of which the contractile bladder Fig i c b is found This bladder is thinwalled extensible and on either side receives the lateral excretory canals The bladder pulsates at intervals of fifteen to twenty seconds and in so doing disposes of the accumulated waste which has been emptied into it by the excretory canals Lying on either side of the stomachintestine are the repro ductive organs Since no males of Philodina are known these organs are always ovaries with their accessory structures The ovary consists of from six to ten small nuclei which lie close together in a clear syncytial ground substance on the inner margin of the vitellarium It is not easily seen in living animals unless it contains a developing egg P1 I Fig I eg The vitellarium Fig I v is especially prominent in living animals It is a spindleshaped structure at either end of which is a connective tissue strand which fastens it to the other organs The anterior strand is fastened to the body wall in the region of the mastax the posterior one attaches to the digestive system 352DESICCATION IN PHILODINA ROSEOLA in the region of the boundary between the blasendarm and contractile bladder The posterior strand looks as if it might act as an oviduct but I have never seen an egg or an embryo passing through it This fact together with observations of other authors who have seen embryos of Philodina liberated from the mother by a rupture of the body wall makes it seem certain that if this structure ever did function as an oviduct it is now only rudimentary The vitellarium contains eight large nuclei arranged in a row This number may vary but this is not usually the case The lateral excretory canals run posteriorly through the trunk and very close to the vitellaria They are minute thread like structures having flame cells connected to them at intervals In P roseola I have never observed more than five of these flame cells on each side The canals empty into the contractile bladder as was described above The rectum is a narrow tube leading posteriorly from the con tractile bladder and terminating dorsally in the anus Fig I an at the posterior border of the second foot segment The foot contains the glands which secrete a sticky substance which enables the animal to fix itself during its crawling move ments These glands are oval in outline are uninuclear and empty by means of ducts at the base of the toes When the animal is folded up these glands become packed closely about the blasendarm When the rotifer stretches out they occupy places in the four posterior foot segments There are four toes on the tip of the foot These aid in fixing the animal during feeding movements B The Active Freeswimming AnimalP roseola in its be havior shows no great difference from most of the other Philo dinidae Zelinka 86 and Janson 93 have described the movements of the philodinids in general terms while Jacobs og has given an account of P roseola both under ordinary con ditions and at the onset of desiccation I have given the be havior of P roseola much attention during the course of this work and am able to confirm Jacobsin all essential respects Two methods of locomotion are employed viz swimming by means of the trochal cilia and creeping by the alternate use of 353LOUIS MAX HICKERNELL foot and proboscis The method of locomotion depends to a large extent upon the temperature and purity of water in which the animal lives Other things being equal a relatively high temperature is conducive to active swimming movements while with lower temperatures the animal generally restricts itself to the leechlike creeping Another factor influencing the kind of movement is the purity of the water In cultures which contain many putrefactive bacteria the animals usually are found creep ing sluggishly about and they seldom extend the trochal cilia for any great length of time Swimming is the result of the rotating of the trochal cilia and involves no turning upon the body axis The body movements during swimming are similar to those of certain infusoria as described by Jennings 04 If any obstruction is met with in swimming the trochal cilia are suddenly retracted and a series of random testing movements occur The cilia are then ex tended and swimming is resumed in a direction where there is no obstruction Sometimes an animal will be observed to stop if it swims through a region where food is abundant In this case it attaches itself by the foot and feeding movements begin In creeping the rotating organs are always retracted The animal attaches itself by means of the secretion of the pedal glands and then after a greater or less number of testing move ments in which the body is stretched successively in several directions it attaches itself by the end of the proboscis This attachment of the head region is followed by the wrenching loose of the foot The latter is then brought to a point nearer the head and the operation is complete In changing from the creeping to the swimming movement the trochal discs are ex tended and the foot is loosened by a contraction of the muscles in the posterior region The animal then moves steadily forward as long as its trochal cilia are in motion While feeding the animal is always attached by the foot Currents created by the rotating organs carry bacteria algae etc in a steady stream into the open pharynx where they are further propelled by the long cilia lining the pharynx The body may sway from side to side during feeding in fact the animal is frequently seen to bend its body as if to reach some 354DESICCATION IN PHILODINA ROSEOLA particles which were not before influenced by its trochal activity During all this time the mastax is active Its grinding opera tions are easily observed in any feeding animal C The Contracted AnimalZelinka 86 in describing the movements of rotifers of the genus Callidina states that the animals frequently retract the head and rotating organs without any apparent reason He observes further that their subsequent extension may be rapid or slow and that no definite reason can be assigned for the lack of uniformity in this respect among different individuals P roseola contracts very rapidly but usually ex tends itself slowly The factors which influence it to contract seem to be i Sudden change in temperature of the medium 2 change in the chemical composition of the medium 3 me chanical stimuli and 4 desiccation Gradual changes in temperature in the medium in which the Philodina lives do not cause it to contract Increase in tempera ture is conducive to more vigorous movements while a decrease causes the animal to become sluggish If the temperature is suddenly changed by the addition of hot or cold water the animal contracts and does not extend itself for many minutes The addition of any active chemical to the culture causes the rotifers to suddenly contract and if the foreign substance is not removed they will remain in the contracted condition until death ensues Philodinas kept in infusions will frequently be found to become inactive in this way An examination usually shows that the infusion is in too great concentration or that putre factive or acid forming bacteria have rendered the environment unfavorable A mechanical shock of any kind will make the animals con tract completely but a contraction under such conditions usually lasts but a few seconds unless the stimulus is continuous or repeated When the water around a Philodina begins to dry up the animal creeps about rapidly apparently trying to escape from the diminishing drop This creeping continues until movement is no longer possible The animal then contracts into an almost spherical mass and dries Especially interesting to observe is the manner in which the 355LOUIS MAX HICKERNELL organs are arranged in the contracted animal While in the extended animal there are spaces between organs when con traction takes place every available bit of space inside the trunk integument is filled by the closely packed organs The head and foot segments are drawn entirely within the trunk by means of the contraction of longitudinal muscles The circular muscles at each end of the trunk may then contract and cause the entire animal to assume a shape not unlike a lemon The large organ systems can be seen through the integument of the contracted rotifer The head and its accessory structures can be seen just anterior to the stomach tissue The stomach occupies the central part of the mass and is flanked on either side by the reproductive organs In the posterior end of the trunk the foot segments containing the pedal glands can be seen Fig 4 Plate II shows a Philodina which has been contracted but is just beginning to unfold The foot segments are slightly pro truded while the head still remains within the trunk cavity D The Dried AnimalWhen the drop of water surrounding a Philodina begins to dry up the animal indulges in active creep ing movements until the drop becomes too small to permit further activity The rotifer then contracts and actual desic cation begins It is at this time according to the older authors that the jelly membrane is secreted The shiny appearance described by them is indeed apparent at times but this is due not to any jelly but to the fact that the tissues of the rotifers become packed together as water disappears and since loss of trans parency accompanies loss of water the light is reflected rather than transmitted by the animal Final proof of the absence of a jelly layer in dried rotifers will be given in the part dealing with sections The internal organs cannot be carefully studied while the drying is going on since the integument usually folds and wrinkles as soon as drying begins This obscures the internal structures Animals dried under favorable conditions all tend to assume a similar shape The head and foot segments are drawn into the trunk as before described The circular muscles at the end of the trunk contract giving to the animal a spindle shape When the drying process is very slow the irregular wrinkles do not 356DESICCATION IN PHILODINA ROSEOLA appear but the puckering due to the contraction of the circular muscles is evident Jacobs has pointed out this fact and my Fig I6 a longitudinal section through a dried animal shows the sides as being free from folds while the ends show prominent and regular wrinkles Frequently several animals are carried together by the dimin ishing drop as it evaporates In this case each rotifer tends to assume a hexagonal shape as a result of mutual pressure Fig 5 Plate II shows an animal which was dried on a clean slide at room temperature and drawn nine days after the desiccation began It will be seen at once that the integument has become much folded and the internal organs indistinct but the vitel larium foot and stomach are still recognizable E Animals Recovering from DesiccationWhen water is added to dried animals such as that described in the last section they usually regain their normal size within ten minutes often before The rapid swelling of the animal causes any wrinkles which may be in the integument to disappear Active movements may occur within a short time if the conditions under which they are dried are favorable Sometimes movements may not occur for several hours even a whole day This fact may account for the negative results of the desiccation experiments of some of the older authors These investigators probably did not give their rotifers sufficient time to recover as Jacobs points out As the animals recover they resume their usual activities I have noticed that rotifers recovering from desiccation are lighter in color than they were before the process began Further comment will be made upon this point in a later paragraph 2 Study of Sections The cytological details of the structure of rotifers has been described in comparatively few cases Of the Bdelloideae Discopus synaptce has been described by Zelinka 86 From the study of the figures of sections through the principal body regions as represented by Zelinka one can see many points of similarity between this form and P roseola In the case of P roseola I find no record in the literature which tells of the cytological structure of its tissues The accompanying figures 357LOUIS MAX HICKERNELL and descriptions are therefore presented here for the first time The finer cytological changes accompanying the process of desiccation and subsequent recovery can only be shown after describing the conditions present in a normal undried specimen I shall therefore now describe the arrangement of organs and their cytological peculiarities in both extended and contracted normal animals after which comparisons will be made with sections of animals which have been desiccated and also with sections of animals recovering from desiccation A The Normal Extended AnimalThe relationship of the internal organs is well shown in transverse sections of the ex tended Philodina Fig 7 Plate III shows a section through the posterior part of the head The pharyngeal cavity leading to the mastax is lined with cilia Its wall consists of thick cells with large nuclei The brain with outer cellular elements and inner homogeneous zone appears close to the pharyngeal tube The integument surrounding the region of this section is much thinner than it is in the midbody region This is to be expected when one remembers the flexibility of the head segments as compared with those of the trunk There is a marked similarity in the arrangement of the elements here described and those in a transverse section through the anterior part of Discopus synaptce as described by Zelinka 88 In Discopus Zelinka shows the integument as being much thinner than I have found it in Philodina The hypodermis of Philodina appears as a definite layer much thicker than the cuticle and containing nuclei embedded in its syncytial ground work This feature is seen in the figures of the sections through out all parts of the animals body In Discopus the nuclei are flattened rather than round and appear as swellings upon the cuticle Furthermore Zelinka figures the hypodermal nuclei as being without a nucleolus Such a condition is not usually found in Philodina Another point of variance between the two forms concerns the brain Zelinka figures the brain of Discopus as being composed of an outer ganglionic layer and a central punktsubstanz In Philodina the same divisions appear but the cells of the ganglionic layer have distinct walls as distinguished from the syncytial condition in the brain of Discopus The 358DESICCATION IN PHILODINA ROSEOLA walls of the pharynx with their internal ciliation are not markedly different in the two forms A section through the esophagus is shown in Fig 8 Plate III As was mentioned before the esophagus is difficult to observe in the living animal because it is generally concealed by the salivary glands which surround it The section shows it to be a narrow thinwalled tube Surrounding it are the salivary glands whose cytoplasm is uniformly granular but not divided into distinct cells The nuclei appear scattered irregularly and have the characteristic structure found in like elements of other tissues The esophagus in section in Discopus shows about the same relative size and position as it does in Philodina It is likewise surrounded by the salivary glands so that it probably is not visible in the living animal The salivary glands of Discopus do not appear to be as dense or deeply staining as those of Philodina The cytoplasmic granules are less closely packed together and the nuclei appear to be less chromatic The most noticeable difference between the figures of sections of corre sponding regions in the two animals is the lack of hypodermal tissue in Discopus While it is to be expected that the integu mentary structures would be thinnest at the points of greatest flexibility it seems that the total absence of hypodermis in this and some other of Zelinkas figures must have been a result of an oversight on his part A section through the middle portion of the trunk Fig 9 Plate III shows the reproductive glands and the middle portion of the digestive system surrounded by a somewhat thicker ring of the integument The plasma of the vitellarium is a syncytium made up of granules of varying sizes The granules are sur rounded by small clear areas containing a cellsap which is lost during desiccation The nuclei of the vitellaria v are the largest to be found in the rotifer body These consist of a single karyosome surrounded by a clear homogeneous area and having at the periphery a distinct nuclear membrane This is the nucleolar nucleus of Carnoy and is characteristic of most of the cells of the rotifer tissues The ovary ov is a small elon gated structure lying in a depression of the inner border of the 359LOUIS MAX HICKERNELL vitellarium It never attains very great size It consists of from five to twelve intensely chromatic nuclei surrounded by a glassy homogeneous plasma A section of a typical ovary is shown in Fig Io Plate III Both ovary and vitellarium are surrounded by a delicate membrane Zelinka does not figure a section of the ovary of Discopus containing more than four nuclei This small number is fre quently observed in Philodina but the average number is slightly larger The clear nonstaining cytoplasmic portion of the ovary seems to be similar in both forms but Zelinka does not figure a membrane separating ovary and vitellarium Whether this last point was due to improper or insufficient staining is hard to say but it seems that a limiting membrane should be present In Philodina a definite ovarian capsule can be easily demonstrated in sections through the proper region of the normal freeswimming animals Another point which leads me to believe that the staining methods employed by Zelinka were insufficient to demonstrate all structural details is the fact that he does not figure a nuclear membrane in the nuclei of the vitellarium The karyosome is surrounded by a clear area as in Philodina but he figures no limiting membrane about the entire structure It is possible that he thought the karyosome to represent the entire nucleus However this may be there is in all cases in the vitellarium of Philodina a definite nuclear membrane surrounding the clear outer zone of the nucleus In crosssection the stomachintestine Plate III Fig 9 st shows as a thickwalled tube with a narrow lumen From the inner wall cilia project into the lumen while at the base of the cilia are deeply staining granules which Beauchamp in other rotifers interprets as crosssections of longitudinal muscle fibers My own observations lead me to believe that this interpretation is correct The stomach tissue is of a spongy consistency the ground substance appearing as closely packed vacuoles No cell walls can be demonstrated but nuclei are scattered at inter vals throughout its extent The nucleus has a karyosome sur rounded by a homogeneous plasma which stains with acid dyes Scattered irregularly through the stomach tissue are large deeply 360DESICCATION IN PHILODINA ROSEOLA staining granules which are masses of reserve food material Janson 93 says that these masses are kept by the rotifer for use during the dry periods when feeding must of necessity cease Beauchamp o09 shows sections of the stomach of Hydatina senta in which these granules appear He shows further that in a section of the stomach of an individual of the same species which had been starved for twentytwo days these granules had disappeared and were replaced by vacuoles In sections of very young Philodinas no such granules are present and I shall show later that after periods of desiccation in Philodina these granules become fewer or disappear entirely thus furnishing cytological evidence in support of the theory of Janson and Zelinka which by them was based entirely upon observations upon the entire living rotifers The stomach tissue is most pliable and the lumen seems normally to be able to occupy almost any position in it This fact has been remarked by Beauchamp in Callidina socialis The stomach tissue of Discopus as figured by Zelinka lacks some of the elements which I find in Philodina I refer to the granules of reserve food material just mentioned In none of his figures does he show these deeply staining aggregations It may be that the digestive processes of Discopus differ from those of Philodina The difference in the habits of the two forms might account for this On the other hand these elements might have been present but not differentiated by the stain The latter condition does not seem probable however for I have found that most of the nuclear stains have an affinity for the food granules Another point of difference is in the structure of the ground substance of the stomach tissue In Discopus this ground substance is represented by Zelinka as being made up of fine granules loosely packed together In Philodina the ground substance of the stomach tissue is composed of alveoles closely apposed This difference could perhaps be accounted for upon the basis of fixation Fig ii Plate III shows a section through the most posterior part of the trunk at the point where the stomachintestine joins the blasendarm The contrast in the structure of the two 36ILOUIS MAX HICKERNELL tissues is well marked The blasendarm contains none of the reserve food granules and its plasma has only occasional nuclei scattered through it Zelinka does not show a section through this region of Discopus but there is probably no great difference here between the two animals Fig I2 Plate III is a transverse section through the second foot segment It shows the pedal gland f g whose cytoplasm consists of fine alveoles and whose cellwalls are distinct A single nucleus is present in each cell The form of this nucleus is subject to little variation in the glands of the undried animal It consists of a karyosome surrounded by a clear space and a well defined nuclear membrane The footglands of Discopus differ but slightly from those just described The individual cells are perhaps more nearly round than those of Philodina and the chromatic part of the nucleus more nearly spherical The general arrangement and appearance of these cells is however not much different from those of Philodina Ventral to the pedal glands and separated from them by a narrow space lies the cloacal cavity This section throws some light upon the nature of the contractile bladder itself It has been assumed by Huxley Claus Vogt and Yung Hudson and Gosse that the contractile bladder is merely the enlarged ending of the lateral canals and must therefore be considered as a part of the excretory system in a strict sense Semper thought that the contractile bladder merely forced the excretory fluid into the endgut and that other contractions of the cloacal wall were necessary before the fluid reached the exterior In Fig 12 the cloacal chamber is shown to be composed dorsally of a thin membrane such as one would expect in a struc ture as distensible as the contractile bladder is known to be Ventrally the wall is thicker and in all respects similar in its texture to that of the blasendarm Fig II On one side and at the junction of the thin dorsal and thick ventral walls there is a break which I interpret as the entrance of the excretory canal The large cell lying beside the entrance of this canal is part of the sphincter which prevents the fluid from reentering the lateral canals at the time of the contractions of the bladder 362DESICCATION IN PHILODINA ROSEOLA This sphincter has been described by other authors but sections of it in Philodina have never been shown It is evident then that the contractile bladder is not an independent structure connected to the posterior part of the gut by a narrow neck but is only a portion of the wall of the gut modified to permit its distension Its periodic contractions force the collected liquid waste to the exterior without further contractions of other parts of the cloaca The more solid waste from the digestive canal is forced out of the blasendarm by independent contractions of the latter structure B The Contracted AnimalThe closely packed condition of the organs in the folded animal is shown in Fig 13 Plate IV The cilia of the trochal discs and some of those lining the pharynx will be noticed On either side of the infolded trochal cilia are the ends of the large glands connected with the mastax and with the anterior end of the stomachintestine The edge of the chewing apparatus is shown in the middle of the section while surrounding it will be seen the stomach tissue and a small part of its lumen The folding of the integument of the animal is well shown here especially at the anterior end where the convergence of the longitudinal folds shows in section as a rosette It is apparent that in the contracted condition most of the water which circulates in the body spaces is lost for the organs lie close to each other in contrast to the condition shown in Figs I 2 and 3 where the spaces especially those between the integu ment and internal organs are very large Fig I4 Plate IV shows a section through a slightly different plane in an undried contracted animal In the central part of the section the cells of the outer part of the brain are shown while around the peri phery various gland cells appear This section also goes through one of the vitellaria and shows its characteristic form and struc ture C The Dried AnimalIn the desiccated animal the arrange ment of organs is in no way different from that in the previously described contracted normal ones The organs are still more closely apposed and the folding of the integument is closer and better marked Fig I6 Plate IV shows a section of a rotifer which was dried 363LOUIS MAX HICKERNELL at room temperature and then kept in an evacuated calcium chloride desiccator for eighteen days At the end of this time it was fixed and sectioned It will be observed that the cilia still show as individual fibers and have not fused into a homo geneous mass as some authors assert must be the case when all moisture is removed There is no sign of fusion or other ab normal condition in these elements Each cilium preserves its identity as well as would those of an animal living in its natural environment Of especial interest is the structure of the integument in the dried state It has been asserted and for some time quite generally believed that just before actual drying takes place the rotifer secretes a jellylike capsule through pores in the skin and this capsule hardens to make a waterproof cyst which remains during the dry season and is dissolved again upon the addition of water Janson 93 thinks it is not unreasonable to suppose that a gelatinous covering is secreted He reasons that since the pedal glands which are undoubtedly derived from the hypodermis are known to secrete a sticky substance and since the tubedwelling forms secrete a slime from their skins which helps to make the tube then the forms which survive desiccation might easily do the same He admits however that he has not found the actual secreting tissues Jacobs o09 found as a result of staining reactions with methylene blue that the integument in the trunk is undoubtedly different in its chemical nature from that of the head and foot He says The fact that that part of the cuticle which alone is exposed at the time of drying should be of a different nature from the remainder is probably significant Jacobs is con vinced that no waterproof cyst is secreted and he suggests that the thickened integument of the trunk region may be a means of preventing a too rapid evaporation as dryness comes on While I have no cytological evidence to show that the sug gestion of Jacobs is correct or incorrect certain it is that there is no thickening by a secretion or otherwise of the integument in the dried condition Fig I6 shows that instead of the integu ment being thicker it is actually much thinner than it was in the undried condition The cuticle shows no great change in thick 364DESICCATION IN PHILODINA ROSEOLA ness This would be expected in a nonprotoplasmic structure The hypodermis however which in the undried animal is from two to four times as thick as the cuticle has shrunk until it is scarcely thicker than the cuticle itself The nuclei do not shrink perceptibly but cause swellings on the hypodermis at the points where they occur I have examined sections of hundreds of specimens dried in various ways and know that this is the characteristic condition of the integument of the dried rotifer I believe that these observations should effectively dispose of the arguments of those who maintain that the drying animal secretes a waterproof cyst for protection during the dry periods In the vitellaria the drying process affects the cytoplasmic portion in less striking fashion than it does the nuclei The granular material of the cytoplasm appears almost the same as in the undried organs The spaces between granules are less noticeable These spaces are probably filled with cellsap in the active animal and it is to be expected that with loss of water they will largely disappear permitting the more solid granules to pack closely together The membrane surrounding the vitel larium and ovary shows no marked change It is of practically the same thickness and consistency in the dried as in the undried animal In the nuclei of the vitellarium noticeable changes have oc curred As was stated before a section of the nucleus in the vitellarium of an undried animal shows a central densely staining karyosome surrounded by a clear space and around the clear space a definite but not usually thick nuclear membrane The nucleus in the dried vitellarium loses for the most part its affinity for stains The karyosome may entirely disappear but usually there are remnants of it distributed here and there through the nuclear space Taking the place of the karyosome is a more or less regular reticulum which reaches to the nuclear wall The latter has become thickened during the process of drying whereas in the nucleus in the undried condition the densely staining material was aggregated in the center and the clear area around the periphery in the nucleus in the dried condition these relationships are just reversed What remains 365LOUIS MAX HICKERNELL of the chromatic material has collected close to the nuclear wall and the central area shows a more or less clear condition This change in the position of the chromatic material in the nucleus is not the only one incident to the drying process in the vitel larium or in the other organs as a comparison of the figures will show but it is by all means more frequent than the other changes The condition of the ovary in the dried animal is best shown in Fig 21 Plate V It will be remembered that the cytoplasm of the undried ovary usually shows as a glassy homogeneous ground substance and that the nuclei appear as dense spherical bodies closely packed in this syncytial ovarian cytoplasm In the dried ovary the cytoplasm becomes more deeply staining and assumes an appearance not unlike that of the vitellarium The nuclei become less dense and the chromatic material col lects in a peripheral ring as was described for the vitellarium nucleus In Fig 2I Plate V a troughlike depression is seen at the margin of the vitellarium which lies nearest the integument This is caused by one of the bandlike circular muscles which drying in the contracted condition caused a deformation in the vitellarium tissue which shows thus in longitudinal section At this point it might be well to comment upon the fact that many of the muscles in the rotifer body actually dry while con tracted It would seem that when the normal moisture con tent was removed from a muscle that it would have a tendency to relax and in this way cause the animal to become more loosely folded during the later stages of drying That this is not true is evident from the figures and descriptions given The rotifer remains tightly contracted during the most complete conditions of desiccation This condition may be due to two factors In the first place the integument is the first structure to dry The moisture evaporates from the surface more quickly than from the internal structures This integument is chitinous in its outer layer but is of such consistency that while moist it is very pliable When the moisture is removed however the cuticle becomes more rigid In this respect it might be likened to gelatin and such a resemblance is indeed noticeable Now with the withdrawal of 366DESICCATION IN PHLODIN A ROSEOLA moisture the cuticle could form a rigid capsule which would retain the original shape of the folded animal even if the muscles did relax On the other hand it would seem that if the maintenance of the shape of the folded animal was due to the action of the cuticle the muscles would be somewhat flattened in crosssection as a result of the mutual pressure of internal organs and integu ment This last condition however is not true for the muscles in the dried animal still show in crosssection something of their oval outline It seems probable that there is a limit to the amount of drying which a muscle may undergo and at the same time continue to exert a contractile tension But the amount of drying necessary to cause a muscle to reach this limit would at the same time withdraw enough water from the cuticle to cause it to become rigid I think therefore that we can account for the lack of relaxation at the time of drying by assuming that both of the factors mentioned above acting in succession produce the given result The appearance of the mastax and its surrounding salivary glands in the dried animal is shown in the central part of Fig I6 but perhaps better in Fig 25 Upon comparison with Fig 24 which is a section of the undried mastax and glands it will be seen that the entire structure has collapsed and decreased per ceptibly in size The gland tissue is more dense as to its cyto plasmic content while the nuclei although just as prominent as before show the same rearrangement of chromatic material as was described for the nuclei of other tissues in an earlier para graph The details of this chromatic movement given for the nuclei of the vitellarium and ovary will apply here and need not be repeated The same is true of the footgland cells although I have observed certain cases where the nuclei of the latter do not assume the usual ring form This condition is shown in Fig 19 The stomach of the dried animal shows perhaps the most remarkable changes In Fig I6 lying below and at the side of the mastax is figured the stomach in its dried condition The cytoplasmic syncytium still preserves its alveolar appearance The lumen is shown winding about through the syncytium while 367LOUIS MAX HICKERNELL nuclei made up of the chromatic ring with central clear space are scattered irregularly about The densely staining granules of food material so prominent in the sections of the undried stomach are not present here I have examined large numbers of sections of dried animals and while the food granules are not always entirely absent as figured here yet they are absent in many cases and certainly in all cases they are much less numer ous than in sections of the stomach of undried animals This point is of importance as bearing upon the question of meta bolism in the dried state As was previously stated the identity of these granules as particles of food material can hardly be questioned Zelinka 88 has called attention to the fact that they do not appear in sections of the stomach of the newly hatched rotifers Beauchamp og09 has shown that in sections of the stomach of Hydatina senta which had been feeding regu larly these granules were present in great numbers but in sec tions of the stomach of starved individuals they do not appear Many authors have commented upon the fact that among those rotifers which survive desiccation the stomach tissue in gross appearance is generally lighter in color after recovery than it was before drying commenced This observation I have re peated many times and find it to be correct I have not how ever been able to find in the literature figures of actual sections of the stomach of rotifers recovering from desiccation Fig I6 which is but one of many that I might show by the absence of all food particles demonstrates that metabolic or at least kata bolic activities must go on in the stomach tissue of the dried animal Of great importance in connection with the question of the nuclear changes is the determination of the exact time at which the chromatic rearrangement takes place It is a reasonable supposition that it could not easily be brought about while the moisture is entirely absent from the tissues Since the proto plasm is always more or less fluid in nature in its normal con dition the changes described would certainly have to take place very slowly if they occurred in the dried state It would seem upon theoretical grounds that the more favorable time for the changes to take place would be during the short period just 368DESICCATION IN PHILODINA ROSEOLA before actual drying occurs At this time the tissues contain the usual amount of moisture but the approach of the dry con dition is at the same time apparent to the animals That there can be no doubt about the preparation of the animals for the dry state is evidenced by their behavior at the onset of desiccation before described Sections of animals killed at the moment when the last visible traces of moisture were disappearing confirm the supposition outlined above The nuclei of the cells of the different tissues plainly show the remarkable changes which are going on and which I have described in an early part of this section While in many cases the rearrangement of chromatin is not so com plete as in some of the sections of dried animals here shown yet it was definite and uniform in the different tissues and indicates beyond question that the transitional period for chromatic re arrangement occurs just before the last traces of moisture are removed The movement of chromatin just before drying is interesting for the light it throws upon the question of the lability of the nuclear material Chromatin undergoes changes of form posi tion and chemical structure at the time of mitotic activity but there are few cases recorded where such changes occur during the resting condition In the present instance however we have a marvelous rearrangement of the nuclear materials which occurs as a vegetative rather than a reproductive process the essential steps of which may take place in a few minutes and the new internal conditions so established enabling the animal to resist an unfavorable environment for years In this connection also lies a clue to the solution of the question of mortality among rotifers which have been dried Since under the most favorable conditions of drying some few animals never survive it seems that there should be some definite cause to account for the fact Comment has been made concerning the tearing of the organs of a rotifer which might result from too rapid drying In cases where this last factor cannot enter there are still some fatalities and these cases seem to admit of explana tion upon the basis of lack of time or vitality to bring about the internal rearrangement of cell elements necessary in resisting the dried condition 369LOUIS MAX HICKERNELL A further confirmation of the fact that the changes in cell structure take place early in the desiccation process is found by comparing sections of animals which were dried and kept in the open air with those of animals kept days or weeks in an evacuated desiccator The essential features of cell structure and arrange ment are the same in both cases This certainly seems to indi cate that the extent of the adaptive structural response to the new condition is not directly proportional to the intensity of the stimulus The nuclear membrane undergoes no disintegration or other visible change in structure during the drying process It might be supposed from a consideration of the movements of the chromatic material into the cytoplasm that the membrane would break up during the process Such is not the case Not only does it remain intact during the drying but it actually thickens This thickening is of course due to the migration of chromatic material which normally occupies the middle of the nucleus The chromatin proper cannot be distinguished from the nuclear membrane however since both react alike to stains The nuclear membrane then is a persistent cell organ and does not atrophy as a result of the abnormal conditions It is interesting to speculate whether the material which the nucleus imbibes upon recovery from desiccation is the same as that which passed through the nuclear membrane at the time of drying I have not been able to make any of the finer micro chemical tests upon this substance but it would seem that the material which passes from nucleus to cytoplasm takes part in the oxidations discussed in a later section The chromatin remaining in the nucleus probably manufactures new nuclear material from elements imbibed from the cytoplasm upon addi tion of water The conditions described in the last paragraph show that there are probably two kinds of chromatic material present in the nucleus one of which is able to pass out into the cytoplasm and one which is not able to do so Judging from the varying amounts of chromatic material which are present in different cells of the same kind when subjected to similar conditions it seems that the nondiffusable chromatin may when conditions 370DESICCATION IN PHILODINA ROSEOLA warrant change chemically so as to become able to pass through the nuclear membrane When moisture is again available the reverse process could take place and new chromatic material be built up from cytoplasmic substance This certainly would fit in with the changes which one is able to observe in the different stages under the microscope The changes in the chromatin just mentioned are not unlike those which Heidenhain 94 has described His oxychromatin and basichromatin could be demonstrated by staining reactions In the rotifer cells however the staining is not nearly so precise and delicate in the dried tissues so that it would be difficult to say whether or not the chromatin exists in the condition just mentioned Certain it is however that there is a change in the chemical nature of some of the chromatin at the time of drying and a return to normal conditions when moisture is added D Animals Recovering from DesiccationThe condition of the organs in rotifers recovering from desiccation is shown in Fig I5 Plate IV This section was made from an animal which after drying thoroughly had been put into water and then killed four hours subsequent to the addition of water This perhaps represents a case where recovery was slower than usual but the condition of the tissues shows that it certainly would have re covered completely In this same section the vitellaria are seen to be resuming their normal condition The cytoplasm is not different from that of the normal tissue One of the nuclei has completely recovered while the other two which appear in the section are rapidly assuming typical structure One of the first changes noticeable in the nuclei of cells of dried animals subjected to moisture is the increase in thickness in the chromatic ring in the nucleus and the greater affinity for stains exhibited by it This is well shown in these vitellarium nuclei The two conditions of the nuclei shown are therefore two stages in the process of recovery Fig 23 represents a longitudinal section through the ovary vitellarium of an animal which had been kept in an evacuated desiccator for fifteen days then placed in water and killed one hour and fifteen minutes after the addition of water The re covery of this animal was more rapid than was that of the one 371LOUIS MAX HICKERNELL represented in Fig I5 for it had already partially unfolded at the time it was killed The nuclei here show several chromatic patterns not figured in the other sections but they are all stages incidental to the resumption of the typical nuclear form Fig 22 shows a transverse section of the vitellarium of an animal dried at room temperature then placed in an evacuated desiccator for six days then in water for one hour and finally killed and sectioned The nuclei here show almost complete recovery while the cytoplasmic part of the structure has not regained the characteristic regular pattern Another condition found frequently in the cytoplasmic portion of the vitellaria of rotifers recovering from desiccation is that represented in Fig 20 The vitellarium nuclei are found in various stages of recovery while entirely outside of the nuclear membrane and indistinguishable in appearance from ovarian nuclei are round chromatic particles This condition is important for I believe it shows what we have not been able to demonstrate visually before namely that the withdrawal of water causes the chromatin in the vitellarium nucleus to diffuse into the cytoplasm but the very withdrawal of water initiates a chemical change which causes the chromatin to lose its staining power The addition of water causes this same chromatic material scattered about through the cytoplasm to resume its normal staining reac tion and in that way its actual presence is for the first time visually demonstrated Gradually this extranuclear chromatin in the vitellarium disappears and it is probable that its dis appearance is due to some chemical change which again causes it to assume the appearance or become a part of the regular cytoplasmic structure In Fig 23 the cytoplasm of the ovary shows that it has re gained its clear homogeneous appearance The number of ovarian nuclei is also greater than in sections of that organ which have not been recently dried I have found this condition repeatedly in sections of animals recovering from drying This is clearly one of the steps incident to increased reproductive activity There are several factors involved in this process It will be recalled that in drying the cytoplasm of the ovary becomes dense and takes chromatid stains more readily than do 372DESICCATION IN PHILODINA ROSEOLA sections of the ovary of animals in the freeswimming condition Since as we have seen chromatic material passes from the nuclei of the vitellarium and of other tissues into the cytoplasm of the same structures it is not improbable that a similar movement would occur in the ovary In the latter case however the ele ments are so small that one detects minute changes with difficulty even under the highest powers of the microscope This condition in the ovary of the recovering rotifer seems to indicate the time and manner of the increase of the ovarian nuclei It is well known that periods of great reproductive activity always follow periods of desiccation Reproductive activity under normal conditions in most animals would involve an in crease in the number of the sex cells Now in the rotifer this increase might be looked for just before drying for if the cells of the other tissues prepare themselves for the new conditions by rearranging their elements it is not inconceivable that the sexual elements might likewise prepare for a season of unusual activity Such however is not the case By counting the nuclei in several hundreds of sections of ovaries in normal dried and recovering animals I find that the average number in the first two con ditions is about the same Likewise in sections of ovaries of animals to which water had just been added there is no noticeable increase But in sections of animals killed several hours after the addition of water one is struck by the increase in the number of the ovarian nuclei It would be desirable to make a definite statement as to the exact time which must elapse before the multiplication takes place but this is impossible since the time varies among different individuals In animals dried several weeks the increase does not become apparent in any case before one and one half to two hours has elapsed subsequent to adding water to the dried animals This time may be too short for animals whose proc esses go on at a much slower rate In connection with the observation regarding the position of chromatic bodies in the cytoplasm of the vitellarium it is inter esting to note that Janson 93 comments upon but gives no figures of similar cases He says Only twice in P roseola 373LOUIS MAX HICKERNELL and Callidina I saw the nuclei of the ovary surrounding the large nuclei of the vitellarium but I could not distinguish whether the peculiarity was connected with egg formation or was due to pressure In this connection I would call attention to the position of three small nuclei in the section of the vitellarium of the rotifer recovering from desiccation shown in Fig I5 This is one of the many cases I have observed where small numbers of these nuclei are found in the vitellarium I am certain from observations on hundreds of similar sections that this condition is due to normal causes and cannot be laid to accidental pressure as Janson suggests I have not been able to follow all the stages in the early development of the egg but I believe that this condition is a stage in the development of the egg and is not to be confused with those cases where chromatin arising from the nucleus of the vitellarium is found in the cytoplasm of that organ The condition of the different gland cells in animals recovering from desiccation is shown in Figs I5 i8b and 26 Fig I8b is a section of foot gland cells of a rotifer which was kept for four teen days in an evacuated desiccator and then placed in water one and one fourth hours previous to killing The nuclei are seen to be rapidly assuming the typical condition which is repre sented in Fig I8a The cytoplasmic changes in these glands are perhaps less marked than in any of the other tissues con sidered This may be due in part to the nature of their contents for being impregnated with their gelatinous secretion they would show fewer changes than would other cells whose plasma is less viscous The salivary glands in animals recovering from desiccation show the presence of recently acquired water by the vacuoles scattered at regular intervals throughout their cytoplasm As recovery becomes complete the cytoplasm assumes the condition shown in Fig 24 and a typical halfrecovered condition is well shown in Fig 26 In this figure it will be noticed that the karyosomes in the nuclei are of smaller size than in the normal tissue They have resumed the normal condition however in all respects except size In the stomach tissue of the rotifer recovering from desiccation 374DESICCATION IN PHILODINA ROSEOLA the absence of the food granules is again noticed The objection might have been offered in the case of the dried stomach that the failure of the food granules to become apparent was due not to their actual absence but to a chemical change incidental to the drying process which made them entirely lose their affinity for stains If this were the case it seems that upon the addition of water the granules would again resume their normal staining reaction That this possibility is not realized in fact is apparent from an examination of the stomach tissue shown in Fig I5 The nuclei have resumed their normal appearance The cyto plasmic syncytium of the stomach tube compares favorably with that in the normal animal while scattered about through it are vacuoles which probably mark the previous positions of the food particles which have disappeared In any event the food particles have been used up and the stomach tissue has the same appearance as is found in cases where the animal is not dried but starved The trochal cilia in animals recovering from desiccation under the highest magnification cannot be seen to be different from those in the normal or even in the dried animal Absolutely no change is observable Upon the addition of water the hypodermal layer of the integument rapidly swells and assumes its normal thickness It might be mentioned here again that if there were any sign of a protecting gelatinous capsule it should be observed at this point when the different tissues swell and draw apart But here as before there is absolutely no sign of such a gelatinous envelope The cells of the peripheral layer of the brain of rotifers re covering from desiccation show the characteristic chromatic ring in their nuclei Fig 29 P1 V This at first sight is remarkable because the nuclei of similar cells in the dried animals do not particularly show such a disposition of the chromatic material However the cells in the peripheral layer of the brain are among the smallest in the rotifer body and their nuclei are correspondingly minute The small amount of chromatin in each nucleus could migrate toward the nuclear membrane without being especially apparent But as was pointed out in 375LOUIS MAX HICKERNELL an earlier paragraph the addition of water causes a swelling to gether with an increase in staining capacity in the nuclear ma terial with the result that the position of the chromatin is most plainly seen not in the dry period but just subsequent to that and before a sufficient time has elapsed to permit a normal arrangement to be brought about The observations upon the tissues of the dried animals re corded in the preceding paragraphs show that they react simi larly with very few exceptions to the drying stimulus The cytoplasm becomes denser This is of course to be expected The nuclei all of which have a very definite and similar chromatic pattern undergo a chromatic rearrangement which is striking and uniform That this chromatic movement is the visible expression of an adaptation to a new sort of environment can hardly be doubted The resumption of normal conditions in nucleus and cytoplasm is likewise uniform in the elements of the different tissues If any doubt existed as to the nature of the adaptive response in the desiccated condition that uncertainty would be removed upon observing the return to normal con ditions as shown in sections of recovering rotifers The sig nificance of the chromatic movement and its interaction with the cytoplasm in the different tissues will be discussed fully in a later section IV REVIEW AND DISCUSSION The literature relating to the cytology of desiccation is in the case of animals very sparse and relating to rotifers almost nothing While rotifers have been studied since the invention of the microscope the chief interest has been along anatomical lines Along with the anatomical studies the Bdelloideme have received consideration in discussions as to whether they actually dry up and recover from the desiccation but apparently no one thought to examine the cytological changes underlying the process Pfeffer in his Physiology of Plants makes numerous ob servations upon the subject of desiccation among members of the plant kingdom His point of view is of course physiological rather than cytological 376DESICCATION IN PHILODINA ROSEOLA Pfeffer suggests that where death occurs as a result of drying it may be due in part to the removal of the last traces of absorbed or combined water He says Since full turgor is restored in mosses and other plants immediately after moistening them it is evident that the osmotic materials remain as solids in the central vacuole Evidently therefore the protoplasm is not injured by the concentrated cell sap If however the latter is responsible for the death of certain plants on drying we have revealed to us in such cases the immediate cause of the fatal action of desic cation It is however hardly likely that the death of plants killed by the removal of more or less of the imbibed water as well as that of those only killed by the removal of the last traces of absorbed or even combined water is alike produced in the same way I believe that the work of McDougal Long and Brown mentioned in the next paragraph shows that plants may have their cell sap concentrated in the fashion described by Pfeffer and still recover from the process My own observations upon Philodina lead me to think that death at the time of drying cannot be attributed to such a cause but rather to a lack of a complete adaptive rearrangement of cytoplasmic and nuclear material Among the botanists the subject of desiccation is now being studied by McDougal and his associates at the Desert Laboratory at Tucson Ariz A recent paper from that laboratory deals with cytological phenomena in the desiccation of Echinocactus J G Brown who did the cytological part of the work examined four kinds of cells in the tissues of Echinocactus wislizeni viz integument palisade outer cortex and deep cortex Starting with a description of these cells in sections of a plant grown under normal conditions he compares similar cells from sections of i a plant which had been desiccated six years 2 one which had been desiccated ten months and 3 one which had been desiccated fortytwo months and then allowed to grow under normal conditions for twentytwo months In the palisade cells the results of desiccation were most apparent These cells are rectangular in section having a peri pheral layer of protoplasm embedded in which are the nucleus and plastids A corresponding cell from a plant desiccated six 377LOUIS MAX HICKERNELL years showed the cytoplasm gathered in one corner of the cell The nucleus which normally is of lenticular form and contains vacuoles was still embedded in the cytoplasmic mass It had decreased to one fourth or less of the size of the normal nucleus The vacuoles had disappeared and the chromatic elements had for the most part become aggregated in a ring in the region of the nuclear wall In the palisade cells of a cactus which had been desiccated only ten months the cytoplasm did not deviate from the normal condition as in the first case mentioned at least in so far as its position was concerned The nuclei decreased almost as much in size and assumed practically the same form as those in the palisade cells desiccated six years In the specimen which was desiccated fortytwo months and then returned to normal con ditions for twentytwo months the cytoplasm was found to be normal as to quantity and position while the nuclei although increased slightly in diameter still retained the ring form char acteristic of the dried condition In the other tissues the results were quite similar to those recorded for the palisade cells In the integument the cuticle thickened slightly in the specimen desiccated six years The outer epidermal cells were thinner in the plant dried six years than in that dried only ten months while in the one desiccated fortytwo months and returned to normal surroundings for twentytwo months the epidermal walls were of about the same thickness as in the normal tissue The nuclei of the epidermal cells decreased to about one half normal size in Echinocactus No 7 The characteristic peri pheral chromatic ring appeared In specimen No 6 which after desiccation was returned to a normal environment the epidermal nuclei resumed their normal condition In the cells of the outer cortex below the palisade layer the cell walls increased perceptibly in thickness as desiccation pro ceeded and they recovered somewhat their normal thickness as moisture was again admitted The nuclei shrunk to about half size and assumed the ring form In the deeper cortex practically the same things happened as were just described for the outer cortex The cytoplasm decreased almost to the point of dis appearance in the cactus dried six years and gradually increased 378DESICCATION IN PHILODINA ROSEOLA in volume in the plants subjected to less severe conditions The nuclei decreased to about half size The cellwalls thickened enormously in the extreme cases of drying and in many cases never recovered normal thickness The results of McDougal and Brown are most interesting when compared with my own The observations upon the cytoplasmic and nuclear changes in the dried tissues show that they are similar in many respects with those in corn embryos and rotifer tissues described in my earlier paper The length of time during which an Echinocactus may survive in the open at the expense of its surplus food material and water was found to be no more than two years while similar plants in diffuse light were sound after six years of starvation The cac tus then which normally lives in an environment containing little moisture is less able to adapt itself to extreme dry con ditions than is the rotifer which normally swims about in water The extreme length of time during which a Philodina may remain dry is not known but well authenticated records show that they have been known to withstand a period of dryness for as much as twentyseven years To date no experimental data are recorded to show the effects of varying intensities of light upon the time during which rotifers may live in a desiccated condition This point I hope to treat in a future publication Another result of interest in the cactus experiments is that in extended desiccation and starvation the plasmatic colloids are eventually broken down by katabolic action This katabolic activity includes hydrolysis of the cellwalls of the cortex Now in Philodina katabolic activity undoubtedly takes place during the dry periods This was most clearly seen in the tissue of the stomachintestine But while the reserve food granules dis appear no change is observable in the walls of any cell It might be said from the nature of the two cases that the reaction in the cactus is irreversible while in the rotifer it is reversible for the cells of the cactus perhaps never assume a perfectly normal condition after the drying process while a sufficient food supply is all that is necessary to make the rotifer quickly resume its normal structure McDougal found that in the cactus the loss in weight in full illumination may not greatly exceed 50 per cent of the water 379LOUIS MAX HICKERNELL present without producing death by desiccation Now under normal conditions about 95 per cent of the weight of the cactus is made up of water This would mean that a decrease of approximately one half in the weight of the plant as a result of drying is usually fatal In Philodina the minuteness of the animal together with the fact that it normally lives in water makes it almost impossible to determine the changes in weight during the drying period It is easy however to follow the changes in volume which occur during drying and anyone can see if he will dry a Philodina upon a slide under a microscope that the animal decreases to from one third to one fourth of its original size Since most of the weight of the rotifer body certainly more than 95 per cent is made up of water it will be seen at once that the percentage of substance lost by the rotifer during desiccation is much higher than that observed in the cactus The desiccation process in the cactus caused few changes in the thickness of cellwalls In the plant treated for seventy three months the cuticle was slightly thicker than normal while the outer walls of the epidermal cells were thinner This result was obtained in the most severe test of the series In my experi ments on Philodina the most severe drying caused absolutely no thickening of the cell walls which bordered the surface but on the contrary by a loss of water from the hypodermal layer an actual decrease in the thickness of the integument was observed in all cases Perhaps the most pronounced cytological effects of desiccation are those recorded for the cortex cells of Echinocactus Here there was an entire disappearance of the protoplasts and a hydrolysis of the cell walls There is nothing in my experiments upon Philodina which parallels this The changes described in the stomach tissue are similar but in no case have I ever observed the disappearance of cellwalls or the formation of spaces as a result of the disintegration of cellelements That the different changes during the desiccation process and subsequent recovery in Echinocactus are very slow is well shown by McDougal and Brown when they state that a plant which had been desiccated for fortytwo months and was then placed under normal conditions in the soil for twentytwo months did 38oDESICCATION IN PHILODINA ROSEOLA not entirely regain the normal condition It would be inter esting to know if the plant would have recovered if given more time for the process In Philodina the process of recovery begins upon the addition of water and is complete in a short time never longer than a few hours For an analysis of the meaning of these changes I should say that the cactus is unfavorable for rapid results The great length of time necessary for changes to take place and the slow ness with which normal conditions are resumed makes experi mental work with a large number of specimens difficult This probably accounts in part for the fact that McDougal and Brown make no attempt to suggest the significance of the cytological changes which they describe Metabolic Water and Its Relation to Desiccation For a complete discussion of the subject of metabolic water and its functions in an organism I would refer the reader to the excellent paper of Babcock I2 For the present purpose it will be sufficient to outline the main points of the subject and relate them to the material under discussion Desiccation is the operation of drying or removing water from a substance When the last trace of water is removed the desiccation is said to be absolute Absolute desiccation of chemical crystals is brought about by heating the substance to dryness or when the material involved is readily decomposed by heat the operation is accomplished by the use of a desiccator A condition of absolute desiccation can be maintained so long as the heat is applied in the one case or so long as the substance is kept within the drying chamber in the other When the desiccating influence is removed moisture is absorbed Inorganic crystals can as a rule be deprived of their moisture only by a temperature of 100 degrees centigrade or higher Not only are the crystals as such made dry but the water of crystallization by virtue of which the crystals exist is driven off and the substance assumes an amorphous condition Living organisms contain water combined with them in a fashion which for present purposes may be compared to water of crystallization In order to remove all water by means of heat it is necessary to raise the temperature of the organic 38ILOUIS MAX HICKERNELL material in question until actual charring takes place It is evident therefore that the absolute desiccation of living sub stance cannot be accomplished by means of heat without de stroying life On the other hand the second method of desic cation mentioned above will not remove the last trace of chemi cally combined water from living tissue Since an absolute desiccation of living things without the destruction of life is impossible by the second method it seems certain that no rotifer or other living thing has ever lived after an absolute desiccation The recorded observations upon the desiccation of living things whether animal or plant have to do with a relative rather than with an absolute desiccation If the water content is lowered much below the normal percentage the organism may be said to have undergone an actual or even a complete desiccation but it will be understood that in all cases this does not imply that the condition of dryness is absolute Water may be acquired by an organism in three ways I It may be imbibed directly 2 it may be taken in with solid food and 3 it may be formed within the organism by metabolic changes in the organic constituents of the food and tissues induced by respiration and other vital processes Imbibed water probably makes up the greater part of the cellsap Its method of combination with the living substance may be as Nageli contended not chemical but a mere physical attraction due to minute molecular aggregations designated as micellae between which the water enters by capillary attraction and forcing the micellae apart increases the volume of the tissues On the other hand as Babcock points out all of the phenomena of imbibition point directly to a molecular combination between the substance composing an organized body and water The combination is in most cases feeble since it is broken up by a relatively low temperature without changing the molecular structure of either the solid tissue or the water It is however analogous to the behavior of many substances both organic and inorganic which crystallize with water of crystallization The water taken in with solid food probably has in part the same fate as imbibed water although its history is slightly different In Philodina the distinction between these two 382DESICCATION IN PHILODINA ROSEOLA sources of water is not marked and the same can be said of any animal having a similar habitat and feeding habits The production of metabolic water in certain stages of the lifehistories of both plants and animals is sufficient for all purposes for considerable periods of time In the resting periods of deciduous plants in bulbs in tubers and especially in seeds and spores ample water is provided for all vital processes by the slow oxidation that takes place as a result of direct respiration Hibernating animals receive no water from external sources for several months although water is being constantly lost by respiration and excretion Many varieties of insects such as clothes moths grain weevils drywood borers etc are able to subsist during all stages of development upon airdried food materials containing less than IO per cent of water in these cases nearly all the water required is metabolic Metabolic water may be formed as a result of two kinds of respiration In direct respiration the organic matter comprising the food and tissues of an organism is oxidized by means of free oxygen derived from the air during respiration Many organ isms when deprived of free oxygen are capable of maintaining for a short time certain of the respiratory functions and deriving energy from food material and from tissues by breaking up the molecular structure into new forms of a lower order This is known as intramolecular respiration When a Philodina dries it loses all its free water The spaces between the different organs are filled during the freeswimming existence of the animal with fluid This fluid between organs is the first to disappear The loss of uncombined water is responsible in large measure for the decrease in size of the animal during the drying process By examining Figs i and 2 it will be seen that in their normal condition the organs are not closely packed together It is these spaces between organs which allow the animal to decrease so appreciably in size and in such a decrease the fluid content of the spaces is lost In addition to the loss of free or uncombined water there is a corresponding though not extensive loss of combined or chemi cally bound water This is the imbibed water mentioned in a previous paragraph Just as water is distributed in the inter 383LOUIS MAX HICKERNELL stices of a sponge so water is held in every cell of the rotifer body It is hardly necessary to emphasize again in this connection that such water is probably not held by capillary attraction as in a sponge but by a loose molecular union The presence of this water in the rotifer tissues is demonstrable in a visual fashion for in the sections of normal undried rotifers the cells all possess vacuoles between the granules or reticulum of the cytoplasm These vacuoles or spaces are certainly filled with the more fluid cytoplasmic ingredients and their true fluid nature is demon strated upon examination of a section of a dried animal where they have with few exceptions disappeared or better still in an animal recovering from desiccation where the former position of granules of reserve food material is marked by vacuoles un doubtedly containing liquid In a previous paragraph attention was called to the fact that in those cells whose cytoplasm is loosely granular in the normal condition the granules were closely packed in similar cells of a dried animal The change in space relation of these cytoplasmic granules is due to loss of imbibed water The amount of imbibed water which an organism may lose and still live varies with the kind of organism Seeds which in a dormant condition contain from ten to not more than twenty per cent of water may still retain their viability and germinating power if more than half of the water content is removed This viability of corn with different degrees of moisture content is recorded by Babcock I2 and I have repeated many of his experiments and find them to be correct In McDougals cactus experiments it was found as was before mentioned that loss of weight in full illumination may not greatly exceed fifty per cent of the water present without pro ducing death by desiccation In seeds on the other hand a loss of seventyfive per cent of the water content need not necessarily be fatal and in some cases certainly the percentage loss may be higher without death resulting In Philodina while exact quantitative measurements are exceedingly difficult the water loss judged by decrease in size of the drying animal and by the nature of the dried tissues must certainly be higher than that of seeds 384DESICCATION IN PHILODINA ROSEOLA The Mechanism of Metabolism in the Dried Rotifer Admitting that the desiccation of Philodina is complete and admitting further that metabolism takes place though much retarded in the dried condition the mechanics of the metabolic activity is the next point to demand explanation It will be remembered that Jacobs o09 showed by means of intra vitam staining with chemical indicators and subsequent tests with various gases that the integument of the dried rotifer is at all times freely permeable to gases Attention was called in another paragraph of this paper to the fact that many animals when deprived of their normal supply of moisture could still exist for a time by means of the direct action of oxygen from the air upon the complex materials of the tissues or upon in clusions of complex food materials within the latter This action would of course not be sufficient to prolong life indefinitely for the time would come when all the available reserve food material would be exhausted or the accumulation of poisonous waste products might end life That such a state of affairs might be realized in the case of a dried Philodina in the air is not impossible Certain it is that this animal can live a long time many years in fact in a dried condition without food from external sources Its lease of life however under these con ditions is not indefinite as is evidenced by the fact that under the most careful conditions of drying some of the rotifers always die To explain these fatal cases it would seem that the store of reserve material became exhausted or the metabolic products accumulated in too great a quantity and death was the result It seems reasonable to assume then that under the conditions just outlined metabolic activity goes on through oxidations of complex substances within the tissues of the animal by means of oxygen obtained by direct respiration Those rotifers which were described as having been kept in an evacuated desiccator for varying periods and which survived the experiment could not have their metabolic activities ex plained upon the same basis as the ones which were dried in air It will be recalled that mention was made of certain cases where metabolism might proceed in the absence of air by means of intramolecular activity In these cases the complex substances 385LOUIS MAX HICKERNELL which are an integral part of or are merely inclusions in the tissues have their molecular structure broken up into newer forms of a lower order In this way energy is derived from food material and life may be prolonged for a greater or less period of time depending upon the amount of reserve material present Both types of chemical reactions outlined above are hydrolytic processes This means then that metabolic water is being evolved in small quantities during the entire dry period It should be understood here that the processes just outlined are hardly possible of actual demonstration for if they are suf ficient to keep such a small organism as a rotifer living for years in the dried condition they must of necessity be exceedingly slow Observations made by Babcock 12 show that respira tion and consequent oxidations in seeds and spores are practically suspended it being possible to detect them only by observations extending over long periods of time If this be true of an em bryonic structure with its simple organization it is true to a greater degree in an adult animal in a state of retarded activity Death ensues in all dormant organisms at the end of a certain time The period of dormancy is limited In Philodina since metabolism proceeds continuously but slowly as I have shown the death of an animal can be attributed to starvation rather than dryness Dryness is a contributing cause of death but the animal dies as a result of lack of food rather than as a result of lack of moisture We may briefly summarize the previously mentioned causes of death in the dried rotifer as follows i Mechanical injury due to too rapid drying 2 starvation resulting from lack of reserve food material 3 poisonous effect of metabolic products and 4 insufficient time before drying to effect the nuclear cytoplasmic reorganization The Significance of the NuclearCytoplasmic Interchange During Desiccation The nucleus in the cells of most of the tissues of P roscola con sists as was pointed out before of a single large karyosome surrounded by a clear area and having for its boundary a definite 386DESICCATION IN PHILODINA ROSEOLA nuclear membrane This karyosome is of course not a true nucleolus since it is made up of chromatic material This type of nucleus has been given the name of nucleoles noyau by Carnoy and it has been described by numerous authors in the cells of several kinds of unicellular animals Nucleoli showing apparently all grades of morphological and chemical properties between true plasmasomes and karyosomes have been described by various authors see Montgomery 98 so that it cannot be said that there are no intermediate conditions to be found Montgomery says The existence of Carnoys nucleoles mixtes and nucleolesnoyaux in cells of metazoa appears to be doubtful yet the pseudonucleoli which he describes in the ova of the mollusc Montagua pilata have many of the proper ties of a chromatin nucleolus or karyosome The significance of the peripheral chromatic ring in the dried rotifer nucleus is a point which requires explanation and correla tion with the other conditions incident to the adaptation of the rotifer to its dried condition The chromatin ring undoubtedly represents a stage of chromatin migration There are two possibilities regarding the extent of this migration The chro matin may merely leave its place in the center of the nucleus and by taking a position next to the nuclear membrane remain within the nucleus proper during the entire dry period On the other hand some of the chromatic elements might be of such nature as to pass readily through the nuclear membrane while the latter might be impermeable for others That ma terials may be changed chemically within the nucleus is admitted In nuclei of cells which have just completed mitotic division the nucleus imbibes substances from the cytoplasm and changes them into nuclear material It is also a matter of common knowledge that at the beginning of mitotic activity much ma terial is cast out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm However it is not commonly contended that materials pass from the nucleus into the cytoplasm without a rupture of the nuclear membrane That the latter condition is a possibility in the rotifer nucleus will appear shortly The karyosome of the rotifer nucleus being almost pure chromatin the reason for its migration might be sought in a 387LOUIS MAX HICKERNELL consideration of some of the functions of chromatin in general R Lillie 02 and others have shown that in many tissues the nucleus is the chief agency in the intracellular activation of oxygen and further that the active or atomic oxygen is in general most abundantly freed at the surface of contact between nucleus and cytoplasm Now the parts of the nucleus which take part in these oxidations must be the chromatin and perhaps the nuclear membrane It seems reasonable to suppose that the lack of the normal amount of water in the nucleus causes the chromatin to be unable to interact with the nuclear membrane in bringing about oxidations and the nucleus adapts itself to the new conditions by rearranging its chromatic content in the manner described I have implied in the preceding paragraph that the chromatic material goes no further than the nuclear membrane and that there it is deposited to make the typical ring structure While this may be and probably is true in cases of relatively incom plete desiccation I think there is much evidence that in many cases the chromatin either does pass through the nuclear mem brane or it is so changed chemically within the membrane that its presence cannot be detected by ordinary methods A com parison of different nuclei in the figures of sections of dried animals shows that the peripheral chromatic ring is not nearly uniform in thickness in the different nuclei I interpret this as meaning that varying amounts of chromatic material have been able to pass to the cytoplasmthe ability or inability to do so depending perhaps for one thing upon the permeability of the nuclear membrane It will be remembered in this connection that immediately upon the addition of water to the dried animals the chromatic ring thickens and regains its normal staining power This fact also is I think capable of two interpretations It may indicate that chromatic material which moved in some form into the cytoplasm during the dry period immediately begins to return to its normal position when moisture is restored or it may be that the drying process caused the chromatin to lose its staining power to such an extent that its volume only seemed to be diminished From the appearance of the sections I do 388DESICCATION IN PHILODINA ROSEOLA not think that there is any doubt but that the former supposition is correct The chromatic material in some form actually does pass into the cytoplasm during the dry period Whatever may actually happen to the chromatin in the way of a change of position it seems certain that the purpose of all the position changes outlined are one namely to keep the chromatin within a working radius of the material to be oxidized The oxidations referred to in this connection are the breaking down of complex food materials in the cytoplasm with the con sequent release of metabolic water during the process The details of this process are discussed in another paragraph The nucleus of the gregarines is similar in many points of structure with that of the rotifer Montgomery 98 speaking of an unnamed gregarine from Carinella annulata says  Now as the gregarine grows at the same time both nucleus and the total mass of the nucleolar substance increase in size but the nucleus cannot grow without the addition of a substance or substances to it which have been derived from without Ac cordingly I suppose that the substance of these granules has an extranuclear origin a substance i e which having penetrated the nucleus from the cytoplasm undergoes a chemical change in the nucleus and there becomes precipitated in the form of granules for no such substance occurs in granular form in the cytoplasm The growth of the nucleoli might then be explained on the assumption of the intussusception of this substance by the nucleoli It seems probable that the rotifer nucleolus grows at the time of recovery from desiccation in the fashion outlined by Montgomery for the gregarine nucleolus Drying then brings about a reversal of this process and the normal condition is resumed only when moisture is restored In considering the movements of chromatin from the nucleus into the cytoplasm one is struck by the similarity between the phenomena here observed and those described by Woodruff and Erdmann in their paper upon periodic reorganization in Paramcecium aurelia These authors working upon Woodruffs nonconjugating line of P aurelia found that there was a periodic nuclear reorganiza tion This nuclear reorganization consists of a gradual dis 389LOUIS MAX HICKERNELL integration and absorption of the macronucleus in the cytoplasm Simultaneously a multiplication of the micronuclei is in progress Certain of the resulting micronuclei degenerate while the re maining one or two form the new macronuclear and micronuclear apparatus This results in the reorganization of the cell without the fusion of two animals They find not only that the re organization process is coincident with the low point between rhythms but also that there is a causal relation between the reorganization process and the rhythms Woodruff defines a rhythm as a minor periodic rise and fall in the division rate from which recovery is autonomous Woodruff believes that the rhythmical changes which he describes are inherent in the phenomena of the cell There are changes in Paramcecium described by Calkins and others involving a somewhat similar reorganization of the cell but whose cause may be laid in part to environmental conditions The life history of Philodina consists in periodic increases and decreases in activity as a result of environmental conditions and in many respects its structural responses are similar to those described by Woodruff and Erdmann in Paramwecium The environmental stimulus acting upon the rotifer to produce the periodicity is dryness The response to the stimulus is an inter action between nucleus and cytoplasm not unlike that taking place in Paramcecium Normal conditions of organization are resumed as soon as the stimulus is removed and the noticeable result of the entire process is an increase in reproductive activity Of course many of the physiological processes of the two animals are markedly different in many respects and would not admit of close comparison but this one particular phase in which there is such a marked agreement in the cytological phenomena accom panying a physiological state seems worthy of comment The Relation between Desiccation and Reproductive Activity It is hardly necessary to again call to mind the causal relation between desiccation and reproduction in Philodina The num erous observations of many authors has established this as a fact It is however profitable to speculate concerning the specific cause of the increased reproduction It is insufficient 390DESICCATION IN PHILODINA ROSEOLA to say that drying is the cause It is necessary to point out if possible how desiccation causes the reproductive increase In an earlier paragraph I have shown that the nuclearcyto plasmic reorganization takes place in the ovary the same as in other tissues and that just subsequent to the addition of water an increase in the number of ovarian nuclei takes place I have not been able to observe these elements in the act of multipli cation but I am sure concerning the results of the process if not of the method It seems then that we are dealing with an adaptive structural response of a special sort Whereas in the other tissues the reorganization of cell elements took place to satisfy a vegetative or metabolic demand here we have a similar reorganization the end of which is increased reproduction and the stimulus to which is in both casesdesiccation In addition to the increase in the number of sexual elements a stimulus is also apparently given which leads to the immediate development of some of these elements That egg cells should be stimulated to develop as a result of loss of water is neither a strange idea nor a new one Loeb o6 in his experiments upon artificial parthenogenesis found that the unfertilized eggs of Arbacia and Strongylocentrotus could be induced to develop into swimming larvae by immersing them in hypertonic seawater and later placing them in water of normal concentration That the initiation of development was due to the withdrawal of water he demonstrated by further experiments in which the eggs were not put back into seawater of normal concentration In this case only a loss but no taking up of the water occurred yet swimming larvae developed Philodina is a parthenogenetic rotifer and as has been shown is stimulated to reproduce by removal of moisture from its tissues and consequently from the sex cells It would seem therefore that we are here dealing with a process which is natural and commonly employed by this parthenogenetic animal as a result of environmental conditions but that the same stimulus can be employed to bring about parthenogenetic development among an entirely different group of animals which reproduce normally by the sexual method The steps in the two processes 391LOUIS MAX HICKERNELL are not to be easily compared yet the initial stimulus is similar and development is the result in both cases Desiccation Phenomena in Their Relation to the Subject of Adaptation That desiccation is but one of the unfavorable conditions to which rotifers may adapt themselves is evident from the litera ture The Bdelloideae can easily adapt themselves in other ways Murray in his account of rotifer fauna observed during the first Shackleton south polar expedition found that Callidina constricta and Adineta grandis both Bdelloids were able to live for rather long periods in salt water although normally they are found only in fresh water Murray in the account of his experiments says To test the degrees of cold which they could stand blocks of ice were cut from the lakes and exposed to the air in the coldest weather of the whole winter By boring into the center of the blocks we found that they were as cold as the air A temperature of  40 F did not kill the animals Then they were alternately frozen and thawed weekly for a long period and took no harm They were dried and frozen and thawed and moistened and still they lived At last they were dried and the bottle containing them was immersed in boiling water which was allowed to cool gradually and still a great many survived Again they were put into sea water and into the brine from the bottom of Green Lake which is so salt that it only freezes at about o F They were kept in these salt waters for a month yet as soon as they were transferred to fresh water they began to crawl about as though nothing had happened  Such is the vitality of these little animals that they can endure being taken from ice at a minus temperature thawed dried and subjected to a temperature not very far short of the boiling point all within a few hours a range of more than 200 F It is desirable that the structural changes if any which ac company freezing and salinity of the surrounding medium be worked out in order to compare the resulting conditions with those in the dried animals It is probable that when the different environmental conditions were brought about successively in varying combinations the structural response is somewhat different in each case 392DESICCATION IN PHILODINA ROSEOLA Bachmetjew o07 showed that juices of the insect body do not completely congeal till they have been reduced to  45 C but at this temperature the insect does not yet die Reiff o09 kept an adult Actias selene at a temperature of 3 to  6 C from November 23 to January 3 Upon raising the temperature to I7 C the insect again became active The normal length of life of this species of Actias averages seven to eight days The total number of days which the two insects experimented upon lived in an active condition was about two days less than the average Bachmetjew says that metabolism cannot take place in a frozen insect because it is impossible for the blood to circulate However this may be we have shown that metabolism takes place in the dried rotifer in the absence of a circulating fluid Furthermore the experiments of Reiff just mentioned show that the total length of life is lessened in an insect when freezing intervenes This strongly suggests that the life processes go on slowly here also It seems desirable that the question of struc tural changes and metabolic processes during freezing among certain animals should be carefully investigated V SUMMARY I The tissues and the parts of the individual cells of a desic cated Philodina roseola maintain their identity during the drying process 2 No protecting membrane is secreted when drying begins or at any other time during the desiccation process The integument of the dried rotifer is thinner than that of the undried specimen 3 Metabolism goes on slowly in the dry condition as is evi denced by changes in the walls of the digestive tube 4 Desiccation in Philodina may be complete but not absolute without fatal results 5 The typical nucleus in all the tissues of Philodina consists of a single large karyosome surrounded by a clear space with a distinct nuclear membrane at the periphery of the clear space 6 The general effect of desiccation upon the cells of the rotifer tissues is the production of a nuclearcytoplasmic rearrangement 393LOUIS MAX HICKERNELL in which the chromatic part of the nucleus migrates to the periphery and the cytoplasm becomes more dense 7 The movement of chromatin during desiccation phenomena takes place in order that the cell oxidations maycontinue during the dried condition 8 The extent of the structural rearrangement which takes place in the rotifer cells is not directly proportional to the intens ity of the stimulus 9 In animals recovering from desiccation the elements of nucleus and cytoplasm gradually resume normal relationships I  The chromatic rearrangement in the nuclei of cells of drying rotifers takes place at the very beginning of the drying process II The acceleration of reproductive activity just subsequent to drying is traceable to an increase in ovarian nuclei This increase takes place while the animal is recovering 12 The cytological changes attending a recovery from desic cation are in their nature the exact reverse of those taking place during the drying process I3 The death of cells as a result of desiccation is probably not a result of the activity of concentrated osmotic materials upon the protoplasm as Pfeffer suggests I4 The death of rotifers during the desiccation process may be due to one or a combination of the following causes i Me chanical injury due to too rapid drying 2 starvation resulting from a lack of reserve food material 3 the poisonous effect of metabolic products and 4 insufficient time before drying to effect the nuclearcytoplasmic reorganization 394DESICCATION IN PHILODINA ROSEOLA 395 VI LITERATURE CITED Bachmetjew P 07 Exp entomologische Studien Sophia I907

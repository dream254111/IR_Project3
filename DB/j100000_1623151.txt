the Creation in Genesis unless we play fast and loose either with words or with science cannot be brought into har mony with what we have learned from geology Its ethnological statements are imperfect if not sometimes inaccurate The stories of the Flood and of the Towerof Babel are incredible in their present form Some historical element may underlie many of the traditions in the first eleven chapters of that book but this we cannot hope to recover But Huxley was not content to deny any authority to the Scriptural basis of most of the religions of Europe and America He denied that there was any means of know ing what the future had in store He did not deny that there was a heaven or a hell he did not deny that in a future world man might continue in a sublimated state and might be punished for his misdeeds or re warded for the good deeds he had performed and for good thoughts on earth He did not venture to express any opinion on the subject for the reason that he had no data to base an opinion upon He called him self an agnostic and the attitude he assumed was agnosticism This term agnostic we are told by Mr R H Hutton was suggested by Prof Huxley at a party held previous to the formation of the now defunct Metaphysical Society at Mr James Knowles house on Clapham Common one evening in 1869 and was sug gested by St Pauls mention of the altar to the unknown GodAryvOaro ey But Huxley has explained that he as sumed this term in contradistinction to the gnostic of old The gnostic claimed to know what in the nature of things is un knowable and as Huxley found himself with an exactly opposite mental status he coined a word to express that aithetical state agnostic 263 I have done all I conceive to be necessary in giving this statement of Huxleys attitude Whether he was right or wrong each one must judge for himself or herself Believ ing as he did on a bed of prolonged illness he resignedly awaited the inevitable and de sired that his sentiments reflected in verse byhis wife should be engraved on his tomb And if there be no meeting past the grave If all is darkness silence yet tis rest Be not afraid ye waiting hearts that weep For God still giveth his beloved

gorge of a little stream White men and Indians composed the party with me Our task was to make a trail down this side canyon into the depths of the Grand Canyon of the Colorado While in camp after the days work was done both Indians and white men engaged in throwing stones across the little canyon which was many hundreds of feet in depth The distance from the brink of the wall on which we were camped to the brink of the opposite wall seemed not very great yet no man could throw a stone across the chasm though Chuar the Indian chief could strike the opposite wall very near its brink The stones thrown by others fell into the depths of the canyon I discussed these feats with Chuar and led him on to an ex planation of gravity Now Chuar believed that he could throw a stone much farther along the level of the plateau than over the canyon His first illusion was thus one very commnon among mountain travelers an underestimate of the distance of tower ing and massive rocks when the eye has no intervening objects to divide the space into parts as measures of the whole FtBBUAXT 21 1896N S VOL III NO 60 I did not venture to correct Chuars judg ment but simply sought to discover his method of reasoning As our conversation proceeded he explained to me that the stone could not go far over the canyon for it was so deep that it would make the stone fall before reaching the opposite bank and he explained to me with great care that the hollow or empty space pulled the stone down He discoursed on this point at length and illustrated it in many ways If you stand on the edge of the cliff you are likely to fall the hollow pulls you down so that you are compelled to brace yourself against the force and lean back Any one can makesuch an experiment and see that the void pulls him down If you climb a tree the higher you reach the harder the pull if you are at the very top of a tall pine you must cling with your might lest the void below pull you off Thus my dusky philosopher interpreted a subjective fear of falling as an objective force but more he reified void and imputed to it the force of pull I afterward found these ideas common among other wise men of the dusky race and once held a similar conversation with an Indian of the Wintun on Mount Shasta the sheen of whose snow clad summit seems almost to merge into the firmament On these dizzy heights my Wintun friend expounded the same philos ophy of gravity Now in the language of Chuars people a wise man is said to be a traveler for such is the metaphor by which they express great wisdom as they suppose that a man must learn by journeying much So in the moonlight of the last evenings sojourn in the camp on the brink of the canyon I told Chuar that he was a great traveler and that I knew of two other great travelers among the white men of the East one by the name of Hegel and another by the name of Spencer and that I should ever remember these three wise men Chuar Hegel and Spencer who spoke like words of wisdom for it passed through my mind that all three of these philosophers had reified void and founded a philosophy there on In the history of philosophy an illusion is discovered concerning matter and each of the constituents or categories of matter which are number extension motion dura tion and judgment and as bodies are related elements of matter relation itself comes to be the object of illusion Matter is the substrate of all bodies bodies thus have a substrate and the illusion of matter arises from supposing that matter which is the substrate has also its substrate which is sometimes called essence Classes are orders of number the illusion of number relates to class or kind and this is also usually called essence Extensions com bined have figure and structure which pro duce form and the illusion of extension is an illusion in relation to forms which are derived from extensions and is called space Motions through collisions are forces and the illusion relating to motion is also called force Duration is persist ence and change which give rise to time and the illusion of duration is called time Judgment is consciousness and inference which give rise to comprehension of ideas and the illusion of idea is called ghost Bodies are related to one another hence numbers extensions motions durations and judgments are related Certain of the relations of these things are called cause and the illusion of relation also is called cause Now it must be clearly understood that the terms substrate essence space force time ghost and cause refer sometimes to real things as when properly used in sci ence and sometimes to illusions when they are improperly used as they often are in metaphysics but usually the word ghost is now used only in reference to an illusion 264 SCIENCEFEBRUARY 21 1896 and this is the sole case where we have a term for an illusion which is commonly understood in that sense but the term spirit is used in both senses for the certi tude and for the illusion The seven illusions here enumerated are perhaps the most fundamental and far reaching of the vast multitude of illusions which appear in the history of error The words substrate essence space force time ghost and cause are terms of universal use and their synonyms appear in all civilized languages and perhaps in all lower lan guages They have always stood for cer titudes and illusions here they require de finitions both as certitudes and as illu sions in so far as we are able to define them SUBSTRATE Substrate is matter matter is the sub strate of all bodies Essence is any collo eation of units into a unit of a higher order which makes it a kind or one of a class Space is any extension or any collocation of extensions force is any collocation of mo tions that are related by collisions time is any duration or collocation of durations mind or spirit or ghost is any cognition or collocation of cognitions cause is any re lated antecedent or collocation of such antecedents of a change Such are the fundamental meanings of the words when used to designate realities We shall here after see what they mean when they are used to designate illusions Matter is the substrate of body and has no substrate for itself All matter has four factors or constit uents number extension motion and duration and some matter at least has a fifth factor namely judgment Matter is not a substrate for these factors but exists in these constituents which are never dissoci ated but constitute matter or are the mo ments of matter and this matter is the substrate of all bodies ESSENCE The term essence as used in philosophy is employed in a double manner and is thus often ambiguous It is sometimes used as a synonym for substrate of matter at other times it is used to designate the occult sub strate of class In this latter sense it is here used Essence then is the number essen tial to make an order or kind of a class As the whole number is essential every one is essential they are severally and conjointly essential so that it is possible correctly to speak of them all as being essential and to speak of every one severally as being essen tial All of the particles which make up a body are conjointly and severally essential to that body and the essence of a body is the hierarchy of particles of which it is com posed The term essence therefore is a general term or pronoun for all collocations of number and its special meaning is de rived from the context As an illusion essence is the name of an unknown some thing which produces a kind or class and is a property of an unknown or unknowable substrate of matter If as the chemist believes with much good reason the ultimate chemical particles are alike they are alike only in number extension motion and duration they are unlike in association position direction or motion and the duration of association so that likeness and unlikeness is inherent in matter itself In bodies innumerable com binations of number extension motion and duration are found and out of these are de veloped innumerable likenesses and unlike nesses so that one body is like another in many respects and unlike that other in many other respects The science of classifica tion takes these likenesses and unlikenesses and discovers degrees among them which are of profound importance in the study of the world and upon which a large share of knowledge rests All knowledge does not rest upon likeness and unlikeness but like SCIENCE 265N S VOL IIn No 60 ness is founded upon number and men have discovered that what is true of a body is true of any other body of like kind under the axiom that whatever is true of anything is true of its identity in so far only as it is a constant property or an absolute and not in so far as it is a variable or relative These are all simple selfevident proposi tions but in the compounding and recom pounding of matter it is not always possible to disentangle the constants from the vari ables Men lost in the meaning of words forever wandering in linguistic jungles have engaged in discussions about essences and have at last reified the word as something which is not number associated with exten sion motion and duration but as some oc cult existence unknown and unknowable which gives to bodies their likeness or un likeness Having reached the conclusion that matter is something more than its con stituents with an occult unknown and un knowable substrate they take the next step that the essence of class or likeness and un likeness exists not in the fundamental pro perties of body or the fundamental constit uents of matter but in their substrate All known things are classified either properly or improperly The characters upon which they are classed are thus in numerable These characters which con stitute class are all the bodies embraced in the class and all the properties embraced in all the bodies of the class The term es sence then used in this sense means all of these things Therefore it is a general name for everything in the universe but obtain ing its particular meaning in any case by the context What is the meaning of the word this  It may be applied to any constituent of matter to matter itself to any body or to any property relation or quality in the ma terial world and to any idea in the mental world and its meaning is derived from the context it has no definite meaning in itself Esenae as a word used by philosophers is a pronoun of like character without specific meaning and attains its specific meaning only by the context it has one meaning at one time and another at another and thus it seems to be illusive As the substrate of matter a reified nothing is entertained in the minds of some as an entity so some thinkers make essence a property of this substrate a nonenity of a nonenity Chuar Hegel and Spencer reason in this manner Essence as connoting the essential charac ters of a class is a word the meaning of which scientific men clearly understand it is never ambiguous although naturalists may sometimes disagree about the essen tiality of a particular character but the es sence of which the philosopher thinks is nonexistent the opinions of the three wise men to the contrary notwithstanding SPACE The word space is the pronoun of all ex tensions figures and structures of exten sions in the multitudinous bodies of the world There are many extensions and every known body is a constituent of some other body and this synthesis may be con tinued until the mind is lost in immensity The space occupied by a body is its exten sion in structure and figure This desk be fore me has extension or we say that it oc cupies space the space which it occupies is its extension from which it excludes other bodies Remove the furniture from the room it is said to be empty yet it is full of air remove the air from the room yet it is full of ether remove the ether may be we know not all is removed then the wall en closes voidnothingbut the walls of the room yet have extension and we can meas ure this by measuring the walls but void cannot be measured there is nothing to be measured Thus it is that space is the pro noun of all dimensions of all bodies sever ally and conjointly and as they are vari able space seems to be illusive and it comes 266 SCIENCEFEBRUARY 21 1896 at last in the minds of careless thinkers to mean something more than extension an unknown and unknowable thing that like essence belongs to the unknown and un knowable substrate of matter The word is useful when its use is understood as a pro noun or general word whose meaning is given by the context FORCE Force is the pronoun for combinations of motion It thus may be applied to numer ous things now existing or which have ex isted in the past or may exist in the future It is the general word for all collisions and all combinations of collisions collisions of particles of ether in light and heat col lisions of particles of air in sound collisions of particles of water in stress collisions of particles of matter in all solids exhibited in the structure and strength of those materi als It thus stands for the action of two or more bodies as they come in collision and thus influence each others motions It is not an occult unknown or unknowable something which belongs to an occult un known and unknowable substrate The term has no particular or determined mean ing in itself but derives its meaning from the context It is a word of universal use whose meaning must be determined by its application it is the general term or pro noun to denote any or all actions and re actions TIME Time is the pronoun of all durations It means any duration to which the term is applied all durations or any collocation of durations the mind may entertain When reified it comes to be thought of as apply ing to an existence independent of the things which have duration Then time like es sence space and force becomes a property of the substrate of matter an illusion about an illusion GHOST Spirit is a general term or pronoun for all judgments in the infinite variety of sensa tions perceptions understandings accep tions and reflections It is a name for all ideation It is known to us only in its as sociation or connection with the universal constituents of matter which are number extension motion and duration There is no spirit which is not a unity of many and one There is no spirit which has not force There is no spirit which has not duration in so far all are agreed and it is here affirmed that there is no spirit which has not extension for without extension all the other constitu ents would vanish become nothing ab solutely unimaginable or unthinkable When spirit is considered to be some thing which is not number or many in one which has not extension with figure and structure without force or the power of ac tion and reaction and without duration as persistence or persistence and change that is without time it becomes a nonentity a nothing and it is then an illusion and is usually called ghost CAUSE We use the word cause as we use the words this and that as a general term or pro noun for anything that stands in relation to any other thing in the production of a change The multitudinous bodies and particles of the universe co6perate with one another in the production of changes The condition before a particular change is con sidered in respect to the condition after the change and the condition which co6perated in the production of the change is called a cause and the condition after the change is called an effect It is thus that the term cause may be applied to any body to any property or to any relation it is a term for any of these things any collocation of these things or any part of these things and just what its meaning may be can be discovered SCIENCE 267268 SCIENCE only by the context in which the word is used In the multitude of bodies proper ties and relations which cooperate in the production of the change whose result is called an effect we may stop to consider any one and call that the cause Failing to appreciate the variable significance of the word men are led into the illusion that there is some entity some separate exist ence called cause Metaphorically essence is sometimes used for space sometimes for force sometimes for time sometimes for spirit and some times for cause and interchangeably all of these terms may be used as metaphors for one another Thus it is that we have a family of chimeras in substrate essence space force time ghost and cause that are not bodies or the properties of bodies but things non existentmysteries that are at the founda tion of all philosophies of the unknowable and all philosophies of the contradictory and the ground of all antinomies They constitute the substrate the essence the space the time the cause of the philoso phies of the three wise men Chuar Hegel and Spencer We shall hereafter see more clearly how these illusions have been developed and how other illusions have gathered about them Here we simply call attention to the fundamental illusions to indicate some what the purposes of this argument It is within the experience of every human being and has been through all generations that man is forever discover ing number extension motion duration and judgment He learns something of number in infancy and adds to his knowl edge daily and extends his knowledge to an indefinite multiplicity He adds to his knowledge the extension of one body and another still embodied in a higher order and thus his knowledge of extension in creases to an indefinite extent He is for N S VOL III No 60 ever discovering new motions and new combinations of motions as forces and finds that he is able thus to add more and more of like motions and forces to his knowledge Ever he is discovering durations  the dura tions of coexistent things and the durations of past things extending to high antiquity and he prophesies durations to come and many do come until his mind is led into the illimitable future Mind is then trained by constant experience to expect a further enlargement of knowledge and to consider the possibilities into which it may expand until it dwells upon endless number end less extension endless force endless dura tion Man contemplates multiples and submultiples of the things of which he al ready has knowledge and then invents im plements of research by which submul tiples are discovered and other implements by which multiples in higher orders are discovered Finding that he has explored but a small part of the universe and that within the universe wherever bodies are to be met they have been resolved into num bers extensions motions and durations he grasps the idea of infinity not as something other than that of which he knows but as more of that which he best knows The experience of men through countless gener ations has organized the concepts of num ber extension motion and duration as the universal factors of matter and never has any mind discovered any other things sav ing only those which are included in the terms of mind Of matter without mind man has absolutely no vestige of knowledge which is not included under the terms num ber extension motion and duration These terms absorb them all Therefore matter is number extension motion and duration and at least some matter has judgment The mind discovers another factor or cate gory in the universejudgment which de velops into cognition of the constituents of matter of their relations and also a cogniSCIENCE tion of cognitions and the relations of cogni tions It is thus that the universe is re solved into material elements and judg ments the five things best known and science in dealing with the universe ex plains them by resolving them into these best known things Science does not lead to mystery but to knowledge and the mind rests satisfied with the knowledge thus gained when the analysis is complete when any newly discovered body is resolved into its constituents or any new idea into its judgments Concepts of number extension motion duration and judgment are developed by all minds from that of the lowest animal to that of the highest human genius Through the evolution of animal life these concepts have been growing as they have been inherited down the stream of time in the flood of generations It is thus that an experience has been developed combined with the experience of all the generations of life for all the time of life so that it is impossible to ex punge from human mind these five con cepts They can never be cancelled while sanity remains Things having something more than number extension motion dura tion and judgment cannot even be invented it is not possible for the human mind to conceive anything else but semblances of such ideas may be produced by mummifica tion of language Ideas are expressed in words which are symbols and the word may be divested of all meaning in terms of number extension motion duration and judgment and still re main and it may be claimed that it still means something unknown and unknow able this is the origin of reification There are many things unknown at one stage of experience which are known at another so man comes to believe in the unknown by constant daily experience but has by fur ther converse with the universe known 269 things previously unknown and they invar i ably become known in terms of number ex tension motion duration and judgment and are found to be only combinations of these things It is thus that something unknown may be imagined but something unknow able cannot be imagined No man imagines reified substrate reified essence reified space reified force reified time reified ghost or reified cause Words are blank checks on the bank of thought to be filled with meaning by the past and future earnings of the intellect But these words are coin signs of the unknowable and no one can acquire the currency for which they call Things little known are named and man speculates about these little known things and erroneously imputes properties or attri butes to them until he comes to think of their possessing such unknown and mis taken attributes At last he discovers the facts then all that he discovers is ex pressed in the terms of number extension motion duration and cognition Still the word for the little known thing may remain to express something unknown and mysti cal and by simple and easily understood processes he reifies what is not and reasons in terms which have no meaning as used by him Terms thus used without meaning are terms of reification Such terms and such methods of reason ing become very dear to those immersed in thaumaturgy and who love the wonderful and cling to the mysterious and in the rev elry developed by the hashish of mystery the pure water of truth is insipid The dream of intellectual intoxication seems more real and more worthy of the human mind than the simple truths discovered by science There is a fascination in mystery and there has ever been a school of intel lects delighting to revel therein and yet in the grand aggregate there is a spirit of sanity extant among mankind which loves the true and simple FRuBUARY 21 1896N S VOL III No 60 Often the eloquence of the dreamer has even subverted the sanity of science and clearheaded simpleminded scientific men have been willing to affirm that science deals with trivialities and that only metaphysics deals with the profound and significant things of the universe In a late great textbook on physics which is a science of simple certitudes it is affirmed To us the question What is matter What is assuming it to have a real exist ence outside ourselves the essential basis of the phenomena with which we may as phy sicists make ourselves acquaintedap pears absolutely insoluble Even if we be come perfectly and certainly acquainted with the intimate structure of what we call Matter we would but have made a further step in the study of its properties and as physicists we are forced to say that while somewhat has been learned as to the prop erties of Matter its essential nature is quite unknown to us As though its properties did not consti tute its essential nature So under the spell of metaphysics the physicist turns from his spectroscope to ex claim that all his researches may be deal ing with phantasms Science deals with realities These are bodies with their properties All the facts embraced in this vast field of research are expressed in terms of number extension motion duration and judgment no other terms are needed and no other terms are coined but by a process well known in philology as a disease of language some times these terms lapse into meanings which connote illusions The human intellect is of such a nature that it has notions or ideas which may be certitudes or illusions All the processes of reasoning including sen sation and perception proceed by infer ence the inference may be correct or erro neous and certitudes are reached by veri fying opinions This is the sole and only process of gaining certitudes The certi tudes are truths which properly represent noumena the illusions are errors which misrepresent noumena All knowledge is the knowledge of noumena and all illusion is erroneous opinion about noumena The human mind knows nothing but realities and deals with nothing but realities but in this dealing with the realitiesthe noumena of the universeit reaches some conclu sions that are correct and others that are incorrect The correct conclusions are cer titudes about realities the incorrect conclu sions are illusions about realities Science is the name which mankind has agreed to call this knowledge of realities and error is the name which mankind has agreed to give to all illusions Thus it is that certi tudes are directly founded upon realities and illusions as they are always about reali ties are thus indirectly though incorrectly founded upon realities but certitudes and illusions alike all refer to realities In this sense then it may be stated that all error as well as knowledge testifies to reality and that all our knowledge is certitude based upon reality and that illusions would not be possible were there not realities about which inferences are made Known realities are those about which mankind has knowledge unknown things are those things about which man has not yet attained knowledge Scientific research is the endeavor to increase knowledge and its methods are observation experience and verification Illusions are erroneous infer ences in relation to known things All certitudes are described in terms of num ber extension motion duration and judg ment nothing else has yet been discovered and nothing else can be discovered with the faculties with which man is possessed In the material world we have no knowl edge of something which is not a unity of itself or a unity of a plurality of something which is not an extension of figure or an 270 SCIENCEFEBRUARY 21 1896 extension of figure and structure of some thing which has not motion or a combina tion of motions as force of something which has not duration as persistence or duration with persistence and change In the mental world we have no knowl edge of something which is not a judgment of consciousness and inference of a judg ment which is not a judgment of a body with number extension motion and dura tion Every notion of something in the material world devoid of one or more of the constituents of matter is an illusion every notion of something in the spiritual world devoid of the factors of matter and judg ment is an illusion These are the propo sitions to be explained and demonstrated In the following chapters an attempt will be made to show that we know much about matter and although we do not know all all we know is about matter in its cate gories of number extension motion dura tion and judgment or that we know of matter in its four categories and that we know of mind in the categories of judgment but always this mind is associated with mat ter In doing this we shall endeavor to dis criminate between the certitudes and illu sions current in human opinion In the intoxication of illusion facts seem cold and colorless and the wrapt dreamer imagines that he dwells in a realm above sciencein a world which as he thinks ab sorbs truth as the ocean the shower and transforms it into a flood of philosophy Feverish dreams are supposed to be glimpses of the unknown and unknowable and the highest and dearest aspiration is to be absorbed in this sea of speculation Nothing is worthy of contemplation but the mysterious Yet the simple and the true remain The history of science is the history of the discovery of the simple and the true in its progress illusions are dispelled and certitudes remain J W POWELL WASHINGTON D C NOTES ON THE DENSITY AND TEMPERATURE OF THE WATERS OF THE GULF OF MEXICO AND GULF STREAM IT is estimated that the evaporation in the Gulf of Mexico amounts to about 60 inches a year thus diminishing the amount of water in the Gulf 154 cubic miles per day The evaporation is greatest in the central parts of the Gulf following a line from east to west and approximately coin ciding with the line of mean maximum of atmospheric pressure Precipitation on the other hand is great est in the southwestern and northeastern parts of the Gulf and least in the area in tervening between the sandy plains of Yucatan and the arid regions of southern Texas and northern Mexico By computa tion we find it to reach 327 inches annually which is about 55 per centum of the eva poration and it increases the waters of the Gulf by 084 cubic miles per day The water supply is further increased by river discharges which amount to about 068 cubic miles per day nearly 70 per centum of this volume being furnished by the Mississippi River It will be seen that precipitation and river discharges feed the gulf by nearly the same amounts but the effect produced by those feeders sinks into insignificance when compared with that produced by the infiowing current of the Yucatan Channel which according to a calculation from Lieut Pillsburys current observations hurls the enormous quantity of 652 cubic miles of water per day into the Gulf which quantity by itself would suffice to raise the level of the entire Gulf 5i feet within that space of time The Gulf stream carries off only about twothirds of the water that is added to the volume of the Gulf in the manner indi cated above and evaporation being power  Abstract of a paper read to the Philosophical So ciety of Washington by permission of the Superin

white pine growth of many parts 1 Published by permission of the Secretary of Agriculture of New England Since in most sections of New England the pine far outvalues the cul tivated currants and gooseberries the latter together with the wild Bibes are being re moved to hold the disease under control A cultivated currant or gooseberry not suscep tible to the disease and possessing commercial qualities would be of much practical impor tance for future planting within the diseased area Even a wild species of Ribes immune to the disease might be of value for breeding new resistant commercial varieties to replace those now being removed For the purpose of discovering such resistant varieties or spe cies of Ribes inoculations under controlled conditions have been made during the past three years on 82 varieties of cultivated red black and white currants 23 varieties of culti vated gooseberries and 48 species and hybrids of Bibes from various parts of the world Field tests are also being made with many of the above varieties and species The varieties of a cultivated species show considerable variation in the degree of their susceptibility to the disease The cultivated species of Ribes also vary decidedly in sus ceptibility Some varieties and some species notably Ribes rigrum are very congenial hosts for the rust very abundant uredinia and telia being produced thereon In other vari eties and species the rust spreads rapidly over the leaf surface and produces abundant ure dinia but the leaf tissue often dies before many telia are formed In other cases a few uredinia form at which time irregular areas of the leaf tissue die quickly with or without further spread of the fungus around the dead area Sometimes instead of a defi nite area being killed small streaks or flecks are killed These dead spots often enlarge slowly producing occasionally a few uredinia or telia All intergradations are found be tween R nigrum upon which the maximum number of fruiting bodies form and R leptan thum on which small dead areas and flecks are formed on less than 10 per cent of which rust spores are produced The vigor of the plant and the age of the leaves have an in fluence on the development of the disease The 243 SEPTEMBER 7 1917N S VOL XLVI No 1184 size of the leaves has little influence if they are relatively old those less than one tenth normal size having taken the disease in a manner characteristic for the host species In many cases inoculations have been made with seciospores as well as with uredospores similar results being obtained upon the same host In most cases both uredinia and telia were produced It has been impossible thus far to have all the species authoritatively identified that being done as fast as the devel opment of the plants will permit Therefore this list is subject to such changes as further study of the plants may cause The syn onymy of the group is based for the North American species on Covilles treatment in North American Flora issued by the New York Botanical Garden and for the species of the rest of the world on Janczewskis Mono graphie des Grosseilliers Ribes L and sup plements to that work Successful inoculations have

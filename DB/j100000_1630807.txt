even in the presenee of our distinguished foreign guests in naming first of all James who more than any other Ameritan has oteupied and influeneed the psythologital thought of both experts and

more diflfer entiation and specialization between men departments and institutions and certain modifieations o method in our rapidly widening field The idealist who holds that the world is mans

and those who with Ijotze still eling to that dear old tradition of the theoretic life that its su preme joy is to attain the fullest expression of ones own personality in a comprehen sive philosophical system must not carp if one who long since abandoned the youthful hope of attaining this felicity vents his own individuality a little as with your kind in dulgence I beg leave to do excused some what by the convietion that all systems the most meager and the best alike are only human documents empirical data sotes resumes returns to be used at last as em pirical data for some greater synthesis of the future If psychology is already far more than a subdepartment of physiology anthropology and psychiatry or a subsee tion in a philosophical system as of old if we may justly reject for it the place as signed it in the hierarchy of Compte and Spencer as a link between biology and so eiology and now base it no less upon the latter than upon the former and not only claim for it an independence already achieved but look forward to its ultimate hegemony in all the fields involving mans higher nature or as being in a word the culmination of humanism it follows that we must regard all that all of us have so far done as only a prelude that much of our work must be done over again that the history of philosophy instead of being phi losophy itself is to be subordinated as psy chological material for a truer and far more comprehensive natural history of uind and that the best of us are only morning stars which will pale and be for gotten as day advances If the germs of soul are as old as life itself and if its types are as distinet and as persistent as those of morphology then though we can no more define it than we can life must we not draw the momentous inference that consciousness alone is a very partial and inadequate organ of experienceSCIENGE 483 OCTOBER 14 1904 and at best only one culminating stage like a submarine plant s leaves and blossoms that alone reach the surface  Does not ex perienee by its very nature tend to lapse below the threshold of consciousness and just in proportion as it becomes complete does it not sink beyond the reach of sub jective analysis Nay more does it not so strongly tend to become automatic that to become perfect it must lose even the power to be transmitted by instruction but only by heredity  1 f so rllUSt we not supplement the lnethods of internal by those of external observation subjective by objective and deductive by empirical re searches Just as history is now studiedi more as the daily life of the

center in the study of love pity fear anger pride eonscience beauty love of power and wealth sympathy and all those social instinets that make our life their sport Should we not find helpful biological suggestion in the example of Bateson and his growing eirele of followers who would go back to facts baldly recorded to lay broader foundations for their pyra mid instead of steepening its angles to a tower or inverting it and be content in some fields with a merely deseriptive psy chology that masses facts not ignoring those that now seem most trivial register ing reflexes that perhaps appear but once in a lifetime vascular and other somatic resonances that seem meaningless in the hope that ultimately we may be able to infer something about the psychic states that onee animated them and do something to restore the great volume and variety of lost soul and liMe that meehanisin missing links and extinet speeies animal and hu man have taken out of the world For myself if I were ehallenged by some advocate of a psychology without a soul to improvise a working hypothesis of what soul may be like I might boldly begin by assuming it to have been more potent in the past than it is in the present but ever tending to vanish as heat which once made the earth ineandeseent does to dissipate itself as something with which the death less germ plasm is more instinet than are the somatic organs it evolves even the brain where it has now taken refuge as some thing no less elosely related than theology once made the persons of the Trinity to be among themselves with the ntsus f ormt ttvxs whatever that is which when the world was young and lusty evolved all the products of natural selection developed and then differentiated hunger and love adapted flowers and insects to each other made instinet and inspired all its pur posive acts without the aid of any sense of purpose was shaped by all the forees that have modified life since it began that domesticated useful and tried to extermin ate noxious animalns and plants invented thousands of languages the syntax of some of the lowest of which are the new marvels of philologists that laid down the lines of the primeval religions and struck outall the unwritften laws and customs of social animals and tribal men the latter more complex and perfect in many respeets as a recent English blue book on Africa insists than any that eivilized legislators have yet devised On this view soul life when it was chiefly passion feeling impulse may have been far more dominant over the bLody and all its processes than now It was hot intense lived out elose to the elements always in sight of the edge of the fieree struggle for survival It was more liMe than thought more collective and racial than individual shaped the world from within rather than as seience is now learn ing to do perhaps in a derived and see ondary way from without Everything4XA SCIENCE N S VOL XX N0 511 was genetienothing logical while as yet no syluptom of the great paralyzer self eonsciousness had appeared This was the great reality rhieh our late developed and seneseent ingrowing intellect has lost and yearns for as old age yearn for its van ished youth Its traces fossils remnants still abound in our own body and soul and in life about us but unless we can read our titles elear to this pleroma of life abound ing the psyehologist will still have reason to grieve as an exile from his pristine para dise vainly seeking atonement with God the world and self Some type of soul life has passed out of the world with every species that beeame extinet every vanished tribe with every child that develops into maturity with every substitution of self consciousness and reflection for the naive intuitive spontaneous and what we call the progress of knowledge is a compound of mingled gains whith we keenly feel with losses that we far less keenly realize When the intellect which seems to hate been developed late as a new funetion of adaptation to the external world leaves the latter and seeks to introspeet its own proc esses and reflect upon them it erosses some important pons This involution is hard slow and with many stages Perhaps first are the halfinstinetive musings on some memoryeontent of eonduct as affecting pleasure and pain or upon motor impulses or the somatic stages that aeeompany thought are more vividly sensed Many laboratory experiments directed to other ends have as their best result the revelation of the intricacy of the simplest psychic operations We find a mazy network of tentative associations and impulses strug gling for survival or for emergence into the narrow focus of attention chaotic ir ruptions into saner sequenees of pereeption or thought manifold shades or elements whieh language is far too elumsy and eon ventionalized to adequately express dis tractions which must be ignored byan act of the will as we ignore all that is in the indirect field of vision From all this we select out the few and meager factors we want But if instead of doing so we yield to the divertieula and seek to note all that takes place within we soon feel that we are sane only by a small working majority of our activities and that underneath the cos mos of habitual sequences and reasoned thought lies a vast and rank chaos of un organized elements that defy order anal ysis or even deseription Some are new and solne perhaps older than history or even than man some strong and compel ling and some so pallid and impereeptible that many experimenters hardly suspect their existence some congruent and some diametrically opposed to each other But the tropical sea and jungle are not more rank with life From all this we realize in a new and deeper sense that conscious mind is only a rather superfieial produet of gradual and halfunconscious selection from all this vast seething psychic activity within of those factors that are practical or most needed for the present conduet of life Old systems and adjustments to earlier eonditions are ever disintegrating and left to lapse and ruin although they long reverberate in the subliminal field eeho in feeling tones or on oceasion have sudden resurgenee in automatisms out breaks of passlon or insistent ideas and impressions or are injeeted like dikes into otherwise coherent conduct or thought The power of survival of these rudimentary organs and processes of the past life of the soul is prodigious Perhaps they never quite vanish even asymptotically If the purest scienee is the completest deseription of origins and stages of development psy ehology may perhaps never be complete IJeaving these must we not hence infer that the eonscious soul we know was evolved solely as an organ to regulate practieal lifeSCIENCE 485 OaToBER 14 1904 that there is no criterion of truth save its value as a guide to conduct that the sci ences of nature and of mind are can be and mean only a system of rules for right living and thinking that to ask what the world and soul are per se is an extravasa tion of the intellect which was kindled only to shed light upon the supreme problem of how to feel and act aright and to which it is subordinate as means to end that to ask what mind and nature are per se and apart from all use by heart andwill is paranoiat or a new scholastic entity cult becallse the end of science as well as the only real es sence of mind is service  Thus the quest of absolute reality must always end in the solipsistic involuere which is only a new definition of zero and pure thought purged of will feeling and sense can not be an object of psychological study for it does not exist Mathemates whith is a formulation of the properties of time and space in the sen sory applies at most only to motion and foree in time and space and its objects are at the bottom where those of psychology are at the top of the seale of evolution and complexity From Pythagoras down to Herbart Fechner the hedonistic caleulus in ethies which the vilest wretch may master without feeling the faintest impulsion to virtue the Boolean and even common de ductive logic which never yet discovered anything and indeed I think every at tempted applieation of mathematies to psy ehology save only for the simple algebraie or other treatment of statistieal data have later proved an illusion if not a mere affee tation and we owe today no more to any eoneept suseeptible of mathematieal for mulation than modern physiology does to the old iatrie sehool that so elaborately treated the bones as levers the museles as pulleys eireulation as hydrodynamies di gestion as trituration and insisted as Plato did for philosophy that geometry was the best preparation for the study of medicine Perhaps no two types of mind have less in common than the mathematical and the psychological or help each other less and may hurt each other more The former has given us hosts of defunet definitions cate gories and dogmas and has constrtucted worldbestriding systems by corleatenations of the high a prtort kind in a way that must raise the query in every candid and impartial mind whether in the field of mind the precept truth for truths sake is not as dangerous as the dietum art for arts sake has proven in its and whether beside the old injunetion physies beware of metaphysies we should not erect the warning  psychology beware of mathe maties and make due purgation of both its methods and its ideals Thus the first and perhaps the chieM danger to psychology as a science today seems to me to be its tendeney asby an iron law to gravitate to methods that are too abstract deductive speculative and af fectively exact Other sciences long since threw off the inflnence of the old systems many of which had dominated them but psychology is still permeated by them It still feels the charm of the old insolubilities of ultimate reality of the relation of mind and body parallelism or interaction the primacy of feeling or somatic changes and is dominated more than it knows by inter ests in the souls future by teleology free dom versus neeessity all of whieh so far as we see ean never be problems of seien tifie

some way or degree Sueh problems have a large and very important plate in the his tory of philosophie thought Their culture value as distiplines is very great but they belong to a stage of mentation now passingSCIENCE 4SU N S VOL XX N0 511 herit is so muth better organized than what we aequire it is so dominant and perhaps so unmodifiable and unaeeountable that the world and self seem shadowy and our un refleeting eonfidenee in these is thus easiy shoeked out of its poise by Berkeley and Hume till some eome to feel that a life so unexplained is hardly worth living When in addition to these predisposing eauses whith for some diatheses may betome a neurosis the thinker leads a pallid anumic life in academie isolation from the great throbbing struggling world and in the study devotes himself to passionless eon templation pampered by the seeondhand knowledge of life derived from books it is not strange in a preeoeious and overeivil ized age with more knowledge foreed upon the mind than it ean digest that the veil of Maya sometimes settles fold on fold over the soul till it almost feels the panie of the elaustraphobiae and must break out and away to find reality or smother It feels that like the Holy Grail removed from the sight of earnal men it can be sought only by those purged from all defilement of the world of sense but it must be found and quaffed or the soul be lost to truth For those paranoiae minds sitting thus in prison whose eonstitutional malady is ag gravated by the doetrine of the ideality of spaee the greatest philosophit delusion of modern times it is well to have highways of eseape opened up out of agnostitism For many if not most too a toueh of it but not too lnueh of it is perhaps a neees sary partt of the eomplex initiation of youth into its world but the severer types of this diseipline seem more suited to seneseent than to adoleseent men and raees For the psyehologist however in pursuit of his legitimate voeation to be liable to be held up at any time to prove that the souf has a brain cr a body that the self or the ob jeets of sense exist that other people and animals with similar organs to his own away and doomed perhaps ultimately to beeome as ueberwndente Standpuncte as those of vortexes the plenum or vatuum the Plutonit versus the Neptunie theories have beeome for seienee The ethieal bear ings of many of these questions onee thought so great are rapidly beeoming insignifieant but they still bulk large vwTherever psyehologists are dominated by theologital interests or even aeeept as far more do their problems at the hands of metaphysies Our stienee is still like Mil tons tawny lion pawing to get free from the soil in whieh it is just being born Many textbooks and treatises modulate from the latest seienee to the oldest speeu lative surds and speak in two alternating registers while others evaluate new results by their bearings upon antique problems wrongly put in a preseientifie aga but made venerable and most signifieant for history by the aeeretions of the best and most ingenious thought of ages Thus the seeonddanger that besets our work is thaXt it is not suffieiently emaneipated from the now eonventionalized eriteria of past sys tems of thought and has not subordinated these as it should to be used not as finalities or solutions but only as empirieal data for larger generalizations that transeend them But if it is the philosophy of phiosophy it eomes to many of these problems not to destroy but fulfil The third souree of danger to psythology arises from the theory of knowledge or epistemology The human soul inherits the result of a vast experienee aequired by the raee but innate in the individual but the latter ean not validate much of it in his own restrieted life He is so sur charged with paleoatavistie traees tenden eies instinets from baek perhaps to the amphioxus or even the ameeba that he often seems to himself to live and move in a world that is both within and without unrealized alien and afar What we inSCIENCE 487 OaToBER 14 1904 have silailar subjeetive states is just as irrelevant and as paralyzing as it would be for the physieist ehemist and astronomer and any old answer makes just as little real praetieal differenee of any ooneeivable kind in the one field as in the other Yet the need of sueh a eult and all its symptoms how they eame to arise and how very real they sometimes are and their forms of doeulnentation in both the oriental and the modern world tonstitute not only a very important but a faseinating problem for inductive psychology while the ways of meeting these needs are legitimate and now even pressing questions of the higher indi vidual pedagogy Finally as to the field and methods of seientifie psyehology the present speaker feels profoundly limitations that prevent him from rising to the height of the great argument for unifieation so wisely proposed in the plan of this eongress and ean only briefly indieate a view perhaps yet more personal than what has preeeded reeog nizing that very different ones are held by many if not most of his wiser eolleagues First no traee of sentieney even the faint est down to and perhaps even into the plant world should be alien to our interest If in doubt between Wasmann and Forel on one hand and the meehanieal interpre tations of the tropisms and taxies as held by IJoeb Bethe and Uexkull we should reeall and profit by the fate of Deseartes eoneeption that even the higher animals were only automata In experimenting on these under the eontrolled eonditions of the laboratory we should not negleet the observations of the field naturalists nor ignore even the more valuable of the eon tributions of our agrieultural stations eeo nomie zoology the stoek farm and the

eontaet with dynamit or funetional biology in its efforts to pass beyond morphology and investigate life histories habits and eauses of varia tion postulating that the manifestations of instinet are just as differentiated and as persistent as those of morphology itself No philosophie prejudiee should make us forget that animals have the same will to live love of offspring fear anger jealousy individual attaehments memory attention knowledge of lotality homemaking in stinets and senses that we do Nor should we deny that empirital methods whether they have yet done so or not are quite eapable of giving sufficient evidenee forthe existenee of psyehie powers as radieally dif ferent froln our owntas those elaimed for photodermatism or the topoehemieal sense of the antennse of ants Not only then might the old maxim Psyehologus nemo nisi physiologus be now also with mueh propriety reversed but physiologieal psy ehology is now expanding both ways to ward a larger biologital philosophy and studies of life and mind will heneeforth be more and more inseparable just in propor tion as genetie or evolutionary eoneeptions pervade our field Childstudy whith began so erudely and has long sinee sileneed many though not yet all of the objeetions raised against it has already demonstrated its praetieal value for edutation and is aequiring a plaee of its own in the literature of other

reeapitulation shedding new light upon early develop mental stages and thus giving psyehology a genetie perspeetive whieh it has so sadly laeked in the past Students in this field are impregnating insignieant and tran sient aets expressions and feeling with new meanings This work still suffers from the faet that like the Renaissanee the Reformation and to some extent Darwin ism itself it had to begin outside aeademie eireles whieh are now so rapidly opening to it and develop popular interest and momentum before it eould attain seientifie methods It has thus survived and profit ed by a volume

point with justifiable pride to its books journals chairs its body of results that all aeeept we believe that far greater results lie in the near future and some times soxne of us indulge in dreams of a new dispensation of psyehology doetrine with evolution more evolved as its eenter Again a new allianee is now eemented with the psyehologieal side of anthropology and even ethnology With almost no

gathering and reeording the myths eustoms rites oeeupa tions and modes of life thought and feel ing of the decadent yet the most repre sentative of all the raees of the stone age Psychologists are learning to proSt by this work and also to extend their interest to every such reeord of the sentiments habits social organizations and superstitions of primal man As a naturalist delights in new speeies so we more and more both need and desire to profit by every new ateount that sheds light on how the re motest aborigine thinks feels and aets and we do it with a psyehit tension and exhila

of its problems in tribal and other eon sanguineous forms of early soeiety The reeiprocal suggestiveness of this depart ment with psyehogenesis is already begin ning to bear fruit So in mental and

notism Many of these phenomena are de volutionary others are normal states mag nified by disease as if it were a mieroseope Criminology meanwhile has shown us feral man in our midst and given a eopious an thology of fatts about degeneration and perversion many of which could now be used to make the teaching of practieal ethies more interesting and effeetive It is high time that mental perversions should be represented by ehairs in our medieal sehools espeeially if they are to make head way against quacks and mindcurists save the profession from some of the tragic ex periences just

dominate the mind as well as the body of his patient particularly in a land and age when psychic and nervous eomplications are more and more involved in diseases We should not forget the old adage of Hypocrates  Godlike is the doetor who is also a philosopher whith will also bear reversing and if the psychologist does not study very much anatomy save the brain and its general structure the new conception of whith he should know he must give much attention to physiology and have its latest results accessible At least the psythiatric elinic where nature per forms her tragic expertiments

culti vated men These themes demand a treat ment quite apart from any problems of historitity and should especially be repre sented in our theological schools whose pupils ought to have some conception of what the soul they try to save is Even the soealled philosophy of religion repre sented by Ritschl and his divergent pupils has not got beyond the restatement of judgments of worth as suggested by Eants practioal critique In fine revolutionizing as the thesis may seem to many I believe psythology should now be dominantly inductive and practical Even the old systems grand as they were must as I said be treated as data of a higher order whose makers thought they were doing one thing but turned out to have done something very difEerent In stead of laying bare the constitution of the universe they were only documenting their own souls with unusual fulness for the benefit of the future generalizer Their work suggestive as it is was precocious and their conelusions premature and about all of it must be done over again on a larger basis of fatts and our watchword must be not merely back to Kant or even Aristotle but back to a reexamination of the primi tive events of soul life

original form of dualism as experi enced from Paul and Augustine down to poor NVeininger who lately shot himself because he could not overeome the evil within whith his almost Manithean system set over against his ideals of goodness Especially as we advance from the study of sense and intellect to that of the will and feelings the ansemic thinker who can realize in his own personso little of

constience wage their wars in the mob the eloister where rage terror and pity be come convulsive and sweep all before them and where love of the lie usurps that of the truth Once it was thought that the study of pure should precede that of ap plied science but we are now coming to almost reverse this maxim in education So psythology especially in our practical age and land must first study and teach how to live love learn labor must have something to say to all who refled on re production disease health and thus must first serve man well if it would later rule him wisely If this view be correct we must abandon many supposed tertainties and finalities and with faith in a future far greater than the past has been devote ourselves to severe and unremitting toil perhaps for generations

CEEMIS1RY THERE is a strong tendency on the part of some ehemists at the present time to claim that chemical science in the true sense includes only such portions of our knowledge as can be stated in aecurate mathematical teruls One distinguished rep resentative of this school of chemistry ha1s said It is not in the province of science to explain phenomena  and another has writ ten It is not a part of its ultimate object t e of natural science to acquire knowl edge in regard to mentally conceived ex istences such as the atoms of matter or the particles of luminiferous ether which are of such a magnitude and character as to lie far beyond the limits of human per ception I think that nearly all of those now actively engaged in working over the problems of organic chemistry would dis sent strongly from these statements Ijong experience in dealing with the cumulative nonmathematical evidence upon which our knowledge of chemical structure is founded has led to a very firm convietion that hu man knowledge is not bounded by the limits of sensepereeption We are inelined rather to the view that while there are undoubtedly many things which will always remain beyond any direct cognizance of our senses yet so far as these have a real existence we may in the end secure regarding them very practical and positive knowledge It is impossible to conceive that those theories with regard to structure whith have guided the work of thousands of themists for the last fifty years do not in some measure express the actual truth with regard to atoms and their relation to each other in organic compounds Ijet us follow for a few mements in very brief outline the steps which have led to the present standpoint So far as the mat  Read at the International Congress of Arts and Science

WHILE THE LANGUAGE OF OUR COURT IN SEVERAL CASES SEEMS TO RECOGNIZE THE DIS TINCTION THE LINE BETWEEN THEM IN THE ADJUDICATED CASES IS SO FINE THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO DISCOVER A LICENSEE IS A PERSON

MODIFICATION OF THE ABOVE RULE IN REGARD TO THE DUTY OF A RAIL ROAD TO TRESPASSERS ON ITS RIGHT OF WAY SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN ADOPTED IN MYERS V BOSTON  AM R R 72 N H 175 55 ATL 72 WHERE IT IS SAID NOTWITHSTANDING THE PLAINTIFF WAS A TRESPASSER UPON THE DEFENDANTS PREMISES AT THE TIME HE RECEIVED HIS INJURY IT WAS THE DUTY OF THE DE FENDANTS IN THE EXERCISE OF ORDINARY CARE TO AVOID INJURING HIM

PARTICULAR CASE AS A SLIDING SCALE SEE 11 VA LAW REG SEPT NO 383 MAY BE FOUND IN THE RULE FORMULATED BY OUR COURT AS THE DEGREE OF CARE REQUIRED BY A RAILROAD COMPANY IN REGARD TO TRESPASSERS AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED ON THE TRACK IN A DANGEROUS SITU ATION IT WOULD SEEM TO THE LAY MIND AT LEAST THAT IN SUCH A CASE TEN DERNESS FOR HUMAN LIFE WOULD REQUIRE THE UTMOST CARE ORTHE HIGHEST DE GREE OF CARE BUT SUCH IS THE AVERSION OF THE COURTS TO THE USE OF THESE TERMS THAT THEY INVOKE THE SLIDING SCALE AND PUSH UP ORDINARY CARE TO A HIGHER NOTCH THAN USUAL IN THIS CASE IT MEANS THAT THE RAILROAD COM PANY MUST DO ALL THAT CAN BE DONE CONSISTENTLY WITH ITS HIGHER DUTY TO OTHERS TO SAVE THE TRESPASSER FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS OWN NEGLI GENT ACT AFTER HIS PERIL HAS BEEN DISCOVERED

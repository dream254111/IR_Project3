ADMINISTRATOR AMAY SUE IN FORMA PAUPERIS FOR NEGLIGENT KILLING OF HIS INTESTATEVA CODE 1904 SnCS 353846TO permit an administrator to bring an action in forlma pau peris for the alleged negligent killing of his intestate it is held in Chris tian v Atlantic d N C R Co N C 68 L R A 418 that lie need not show personal inability to give the required bond or make the necessary deposit but that it is sufficient if he shows such inability on behalf of the estate and those for whose benefit the suit is really brought The other cases on the right of executor or administrator to sue defend or appeal in forma pauperis are considered in a note to this case The same rule would probably be applied under our statute Va Code 1904 Sec 3538 especially since Sec 3546 makes the party for whom the suit is brought alone liable for costs WILLSINCORPORATION OF EXTRINSIC DOCUMENTWM J BRYANS CELE BRATED CASEThat the contents of an extrinsic document cannot be incor porated into a will by a clause stating that a sum was given in trust for the purpose set forth in the sealed letter which will be found with the will is declared in Bryans Appeal Conn 68 L R A 353 vwhere the will contains no clear explicit and unambiguous reference to a speci fic document as the one intended The other authorities on incorporation of extrinsic document into will are considered in a note to this case JURORSCOMPETENCY Jurors who have rendered a verdict of guilty in a trial of one person for bribery are held in People v Mol Mich 68 L R A 871 not to be impartial within the constitutional requirement so as to be competent to serve at the trial of another person indicted for the same offense and whose guilt depends upon practically the same evi dence as that offered at the other trial and the bearing of which upon his guilt must have been considered at that trial The other cases as to competency of jurors who have served in the same or a similar case are collated in a note to this case TRESPASSERS AND LICENSEES ON A RAILROAD RIGHT OF WAYDUTY OF RAILROAD TOWARDSIt is held in a great many jurisdictions that there is little if any difference between the duty of a railroad toward a tres passer and the degree of care owed to a mere licensee on its right of way and that its sole duty in either case is to refrain from active misconduct or wanton and wilful injury Meneo v Cent R Co 84 N Y Supp 448 Wencker v Mo K  T R Co 169 Mo 592 70 S W 145 Ill Cent R Co v Eicher 202 IlN E 376 In Blankenship v C  0 Ry Co 94 Va 449 455 Judge Buchanan says that there seems to be a recognized distinction between the degree of 612 NovNOTES OF CASES care which a railroad owes under ordinary circumstances to a trespasser and that owed to one upon its right of way by license of the company and while the language of our court in several cases seems to recognize the dis tinction the line between them in the adjudicated cases is so fine that it is difficult to discover A licensee is a person who is neither a passenger servant or tres passer and who not standing in any contractual relations to the railroad is permitted by the company to come upon its premises for his own interests or gratification Norfolk  W R Co v Wood 99 Va 156 159 Northwestern El R Co v OMalley 107 Ill App 599 Our court has often held that it is not the duty of the employees of a railroad com pany operating its trains to use reasonable care to discover and avoid injuring persons trespassing upon its tracks Seaboard etc R Co v Joy ner 92 Va 354 Tucker v N  W Co 92 Va 549 Norfolk  FW R Co v Dunnaway 93 Va 29 36 Chesapeake etc R Co v Rogers 100 Va 324 332 But toward licensees the rule is laid down that the sole duty that the railroad company owes to such persons is to use reasonable care to dis cover and not to injure them but all that this term discover seems to include is to keep a lookout ahead and it does not include having a light on the engine during a dark night in other words as far as a tres passer is concerned the engineer or watchman may go to sleep but as re gards a licensee the engineer must keep his eyes open and look ahead even if it is so dark that he cannot see a foot ahead of the engine and the company is under no obligation so far as either of the above classes is concerned to improve his facilities for seeing WTilliamson v Southern Ry Co 51 S E 195 11 Va Law Reg 289 Blankenship v C  O R Co 94 Va 449 27 S E 20 C  0 Ry Co v Rogers Adrmx 100 Va 324 41 S E 732 It seems pertinent to remark that in the Rogers case supra the court held that where the community used the railroad right of way daily with the acquiescence of the company it made no difference whether such persons were trespassers or licensees for in either case it was the duty of the company to use reasonable care to discover and not to injure such persons whereas in the Bruce case supra and in the Williamson case supra it is specifically decided that such persons are bare licensees A slight modification of the above rule in regard to the duty of a rail road to trespassers on its right of way seems to have been adopted in Myers v Boston  AM R R 72 N H 175 55 Atl 72 where it is said Notwithstanding the plaintiff was a trespasser upon the defendants premises at the time he received his injury it was the duty of the de fendants in the exercise of ordinary care to avoid injuring him through their active intervention if they knew of his presence in a dangerous situa tion or if their failure to know of it was due to their culpable ignorance In other words they were in fault if they failed to use due care to discover his presence in a position of danger when circumstances existed which would put a man of average prudence upon inquiry Mitchell v Railroad 1905 61311 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER 68 N H34 Atl 674 Shea v Railroad 69 NH 361 363 41 Atl 774 This does not mean that the defendants were bound to ascertain and take pre caution in reference to the plaintiffs possible or chance presence in a dan gerous situation upon their premises but that they were required not to actually injure him if circumstances existed that warranted their antici pating his presence in such a situation as a probable occurrence Shea v Railroad supra Davis v Railroad 70 N H 519 49 Atl 108 An instance of the use of the expression ordinary care under all the facts and circumstances of the particular case as a sliding scale see 11 Va Law Reg Sept No 383 may be found in the rule formulated by our court as the degree of care required by a railroad company in regard to trespassers after they have been discovered on the track in a dangerous situ ation It would seem to the lay mind at least that in such a case ten derness for human life would require the utmost care orthe highest de gree of care but such is the aversion of the courts to the use of these terms that they invoke the sliding scale and push up ordinary care to a higher notch than usual In this case it means that the railroad com pany must do all that can be done consistently with its higher duty to others to save the trespasser from the consequences of his own negli gent act after his peril has been discovered Humphreys v Valley R Co 100 Va 749 754 755 C B G MINOR FEMALE MABnYINGJURISDICTION TO APPOINT RECEIVESEC 2291 VA CODE 1904See 2291 of the Code of 1887 provided that when a wo man was a minor at the time she married and was then entitled to any estate she should not during coverture and while a minor have the control thereof but the circuit court of the county or the circuit or corporation court of the corporation wherein she resides or the said estate or any part thereof isshall commit her estate to a receiver etc This section was amended by Acts 18991900 ch 1139 p 1240 see Va Code 1904 sec 2291 so as to read as to the latter part but the circuit court of the county or the circuit or corporation court of the cor poration wherein she resides or the said real estate or any part thereof is shall commit her said estate to a receiver etc It has been suggested to us that the insertion of the word real was probably a slip and the query is made if it be not a slip what is the ef fect of the insertion The effect of the insertion seems obvious The former law purported to allow the property of a minor female to be committed to a receiver when she married by the circuit or corporation court in whose jurisdiction she resided or by any such court in whose jurisdiction the property or part of it was situated whether the property was real or personal As the statute now stands if the property be personal only the court of the county or corporation wherein she resides can commit such property into the hands 614 Nov

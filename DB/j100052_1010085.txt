J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1010085,POLITICAL ACTION AND TRADEUNIONISM,I242563,POLITICAL ACTION AND TRADEUNIONISM THE PROPOSAL TO MAKE POLITICAL ACTION A FEATURE OF AMERICAN TRADEUNIONISM ALTHOUGH ALWAYS A TOPIC OF DISCUSSION AMONG ORGAN IZED WORKERS AND AT TIMES A SUBJECT OF PRACTICAL EXPERIMENT BY CER TAIN BODIES MAY BE SAID TO HAVE FIRST ASSUMED DEFINITE NATIONAL FORM AT THE CONVENTION OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR HELD IN CHICAGO IN I893 THE HISTORY OF THE DEBATE AND ACTION THEREON COVERING THE INTERVENING DECADE CONSTITUTES PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT EPOCH IN THE LABOR MOVEMENT OF THE PRESENT GENERATION UPON THIS PRE SUMPTION THESE EVENTS SEEM TO JUSTIFY MORE DETAILED AND CONSECU TIVE TREATMENT THAN HAS AS YET BEEN ACCORDED THEM DURING THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS PAPER THE GROWTH OF ORGANIZATION AMONG THE WORKERS IN THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN PHENOMENAL THE EXTENT CHARACTER AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THAT GROWTH HAVE PRESENTED A GREAT OPPORTUNITY AND ALSO A GREAT DANGER SPEAKING GENERALLY IT MAY BE SAID THAT THE LABOR MOVEMENT HAS FAIRLY WELL AVAILED ITSELF OF THE FORMER AND IN THE MAIN AVOIDED THE LATTER OF THESE SITUATIONS THROUGHOUT THE VARIOUS CRISES OF THE DECADE THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR HAS MAINTAINED THE COURSE THAT AS THE RESULTS HAVE FREQUENTLY SHOWN IS BEST CALCULATED TO CONSERVE THE TRUE INTERESTS AND CONTINUED PROGRESS OF ITS OWN MEMBERSHIP AND OF THE INDUSTRIAL WORLD AT LARGE THE DISPOSITION AND POWER TO MAIN TAIN THIS ATTITUDE IS DUE MAINLY TO THE LONG DISCUSSION OF POLITICAL ACTION AS A NECESSARY OR DESIRABLE ADJUNCT OR COMPLEMENT OF TRADE UNIONISM AT THE CHICAGO CONVENTION A POLITICAL PROGRAMME WAS INTRO DUCED THE DISCUSSION THEREON SHORTLY RESOLVED ITSELF INTO A PRO POSAL TO REFER THE ENTIRE SUBJECT MATTER TO THE AFFILIATED UNIONS FOR FAVORABLE CONSIDERATION AND INSTRUCTIONS TO THE NEXT CONVEN TION A RESOLUTION TO THIS EFFECT BUT WITH THE WORD FAVORABLE STRICKEN OUT WAS ADOPTED WHEN THE CONVENTION MET IN DENVER IN I894 THE POLITICAL PROGRAMME WAS AGAIN BROUGHT UP FOR ACTION 316POLITICAL ACTION AND TRADEUNIONISM THE PREAMBLE OF THE PROGRAMME WAS AS FOLLOWS WHEREAS THE TRADEUNIONISTS OF GREAT BRITAIN HAVE BY THE LIGHT OF EXPERI ENCE AND THE LOGIC OF PROGRESS ADOPTED THE PRINCIPLE OF INDEPENDENT LABOR POLITICS AS AN AUXILIARY TO THEIR ECONOMIC ACTION AND WHEREAS SUCH ACTION HAS RESULTED IN THE MOST GRATIFYING SUCCESS AND WHEREAS SUCH INDEPENDENT LABOR POLITICS ARE BASED UPON THE FOLLOWING PROGRAMME TO WIT MR ADOLPH STRASSER A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CIGARMAKERS INTERNATIONAL UNION AND A LEADER OF HIGH INTELLECTUAL ATTAINMENTS AND WIDE KNOWLEDGE OF THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ACTIVITIES OF THE WORKERS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD MOVED THAT THE PREAMBLE BE STRICKEN OUT BEING A MISREPRESENTATION OF FACTS THE DEBATE ON THIS MOTION CENTERED UPON THE QUESTION AS TO HOW FAR THE PREAMBLE MISREPRESENTED THE ACTION TAKEN BY3 THE BRITISH TRADEUNION CONGRESS HELD IN BELFAST DURING THE PREVIOUS YEAR THE PREVAILING OPINION WAS THAT THE ACTION OF THE BELFAST GATHERING WAS WITHOUT WARRANT IN THE SENTIMENT OF ITS CONSTITUENTS AND HAD BEEN REPUDIATED BY THEM DURING THE DEBATE THE AUTHOR OF THE PREAMBLE ADMITTED THE COMPARATIVELY SLENDER BASIS OF HIS CLAIM IN THESE WORDS I SIMPLY WANT TO SAY THAT IN THE STATEMENT IN THE PREAMBLE THERE IS A SUFFI CIENCY OF TRUTH TO AT LEAST PROTECT ANY MAN FROM BEING CHARGED WITH BOLD MIS REPRESENTATION MR STRASSERS MOTION TO STRIKE OUT THE PREAMBLE WAS ADOPTED BY A VOTE OF 1345 TO 861 REPRESENTING A MEMBERSHIP OF I34500 TO 86IOO RESPECTIVELY THE POLITICAL PROGRAMME HERE ALLUDED TO CONTAINED A NUM BER OF PLANKS BUT THE PURPOSE OF ITS MOVER AND HIS SUPPORTERS WAS EMBODIED IN A SINGLE ONE OF THESE DECLARATIONS KNOWN AS PLANK IO WHICH PROVIDED FOR  THE COLLECTIVE OWNERSHIP BY THE PEOPLE OF ALL MEANS OF PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION THIS WAS A PLAIN DECLARATION FOR SOCIALISM AND WAS SO REGARDED BY ITS OPPONENTS AND SO ADMITTED BY ITS ADVOCATES THROUGHOUT THE DEBATE UPON IT HOWEVER IT IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THIS AND ALL I DELEGATES TO THE CONVENTION OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR CAST ONE VOTE FOR EACH 100 MEMBERS OR MAJOR FRACTION THEREOF REPRESENTED BY THEM 317 33THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY SUBSEQUENT EFFORTS TO COMMIT THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR TO POLITICAL ACTION THAT WHILE THE LANGUAGE OF THE PROPOSALS HAS STUDIOUSLY EXCLUDED THE TERM SOCIALISM THE TERM POLITICAL ACTION INDEPENDENT OF THE OLD PARTIES BEING USED IN PREFERENCE ITS REAL OBJECT HAS BEEN NONE THE LESS APPARENT SEVERAL AMENDMENTS WERE INTRODUCED AND DISCUSSED AND FINALLY THE CONVENTION ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING SUBSTITUTE THE ABOLITION OF THE MONOPOLY SYSTEM OF LAND HOLDING AND THE SUBSTITUTION THEREFOR OF A TITLE OF OCCUPANCY AND USE ONLY PLANK IO IN THE FORM FINALLY ADOPTED WAS A VICTORY OF SINGLE TAX SENTIMENT OVER THAT OF SOCIALISM A MOTION TO ADOPT THE PLANKS AS A WHOLE WAS DEFEATED OWING TO A MISUNDERSTANDING HOWEVER THE SUCCEEDING CONVENTION FORMALLY ADOPTED THE PLANKS NOT AS A POLITICAL PROGRAMME BUT AS LEGISLATIVE DEMANDS2 NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR DEFEAT AT THE DENVER CONVENTION OF 1894 AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE ACTION OF THAT GATHERING WAS BASED UPON PRESUMABLY SETTLED LINES OF TRADEUNION POLICY THE DELEGATES HOLDING SOCIALISTIC VIEWS UPON POLITICAL MATTERS HAVE PERSISTED IN THE EFFORT TO SECURE AN ENDORSEMENT OF THESE VIEWS FROM EACH SUC CEEDING CONVENTION OF THE FEDERATION THE RESULT HAS BEEN UNI FORMLY THE SAME IN EACH INSTANCE I E REFUSAL TO PLEDGE OR ADVISE THE TRADEUNIONS TO TAKE PART AS SUCH IN ANY MOVEMENT IN THE NATURE OF PARTISAN POLITICS THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWSTHE RESULT OF THE VOTE ON THE SOCIALIST RESOLUTIONS AT EACH CONVENTION DURING THE PAST TEN

TO I9O0 INCLUSIVE THE SENTIMENT OF THE CONVENTIONS WAS VERY STRONGLY AGAINST POLITICAL ACTION FIVE OF THE CONVENTIONS HELD DURING THAT PERIOD DISPOSED OF THE SUBJECT BY VIVA VOCE VOTE THE VOTE TAKEN AT THE NEW ORLEANS CONVENTION OF 1902 WOULD INDICATE THAT SENTIMENT HAD TURNED IN FAVOR OF POLITICAL ACTION THE FIGURES IN THIS CASE AFFORDED MERELY A SURFACE INDICATION HOWEVER IT IS A FEATURE COMMON TO ALL THE VOTES THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN UPON THIS QUESTION THAT IN THE FINAL ALIGNMENT OF THE DELEGATES A NUMBER HAVE BEEN ACTUATED BY SECONDARY MOTIVES THIS WAS ESPECIALLY THE CASE AT THE NEW ORLEANS CONVENTION ON THAT OCCASION SEVEN RESO LUTIONS WERE INTRODUCED ALL HAVING POLITICAL ACTION AS THEIR EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED PURPOSE THESE WERE REPORTED BACK WITH A RECOMMENDA TION THAT THE CONVENTION NONCONCUR THEREIN AND INSTEAD ADOPT A REAFFIRMATION OT THE DECLARATION MADE BY THE PRECEDING CONVENTION THAT OUR MEETINGS LOCAL AND NATIONAL ARE NOW AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN FREE TO THE DISCUSSION OF ANY LEGITIMATE ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL QUESTION BUT ON THE OTHER HAND ARE EQUALLY PRONOUNCED AGAINST ANY PARTISAN POLITICS RELIGIOUS DISCUSSIONS OR RACE PREJUDICES TO THIS REPORT AN AMENDMENT WAS OFFERED ADVISING THE WORKING PEOPLE TO ORGANIZE THEIR ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL POWER TO SECURE FOR LABOR THE FULL EQUIVALENT OF ITS TOIL AND THE OVERTHROWAL OF THE WAGE SYSTEM AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INDUSTRIAL COOPERATIVE DEMOCRACY THE LATTER WAS IN TURN AMENDED BY A DELEGATE 3DELEGATES TO THE CONVENTION OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR CAST ONE VOTE FOR EVERY ONE HUNDRED MEMBERS OR MAJOR FRACTION THEREOF  REPRESENTED BY THEM IN THE TABLE TWO CIPHERS HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE TALLY OF VOTES CAST FOR THE PURPOSE OF APPROXIMATING THE TOTAL MEMBER SHIP REPRESENTED IN EACH CASE DELEGATES FROM CITY TRADES COUNCILS AND STATE FEDERATIONS CAST BUT A SINGLE VOTE EACH BUT AS THE NUMBER OF SUCH DELEGATES IS USUALLY RELATIVELY SMALL THE IN CLUSION OF THEIR VOTES UNDER THE RULE HERE ADOPTED DOES NOT MATERIALLY AFFECT THE RESULT ATTAINED USUALLY A NUMBER OF DELEGATES HAVE FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER FAILED TO VOTE AGAIN THE ACTUAL MEMBERSHIP OF THE FEDERATION IS ALWAYS CONSIDERABLY IN EXCESS OF THAT REPRESENTED AT THE CON VENTIONS FOR INSTANCE AT THE BOSTON CONVENTION OF 1903AN UNUSUALLY REPRESENTATIVE GATHER INGTHE NUMBER OF DELEGATES PRESENT WAS 496 WHILE THE NUMBER RECORDED AS VOTING WAS BUT 364 THE ACTUAL MEMBERSHIP WAS ESTIMATED AT 1465800 WHILE THE DELEGATES VOTING REPRESEN TED BUT 1342900 THE MAJORITY VOTE IN THE NEW YORK CONVENTION OF 1895 EXPRESSED THE SENTIMENT THAT THE FAILURE OF THE DENVER CONVENTION OF THE PREVIOUS YEAR TO ADOPT THE POLITICAL PROGRAMME AS A WHOLE  WAS EQUIVALENT TO A REJECTION AND THEREFORE WE DECLARE THAT THE AMERICAN FEDERA TION HAS NO POLITICAL PLATFORM IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THIS VOTE A MOTION WAS ADOPTED PRO VIDING THAT THESE RESOLUTIONS I E THE PLANKS ADOPTED BY THE DENVER CONVENTION HE KEPT STAFIDINGIN THE AMERICAN FEDERATIONIST AS LEGISLATIVE DEMANDS  319 35THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY REPRESENTING THE UNITED MINE WORKERS SO AS TO STRIKE OUT EVERY THING AFTER THE WORD TOIL THIS WAS ACCEPTED BY THE DELEGATE WHO OFFERED THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND THUS THE LINES WERE MERGED THE POLITICAL ACTION AMENDMENT HAVING APPARENTLY BEEN RENDERED INNOCUOUS BY THE PROPOSAL OF THE MINE WORKERS DELEGATE RECEIVED THE VOTE OF THE DELEGATES FROM THE LATTER ORGANIZATION REPRESENTING A MEMBERSHIP OF I854O0 AND ALSO OF MANY OTHER DELEGATES WHO UPON A MORE DEFINITE PRESENTATION WOULD HAVE BEEN RECORDED IN OPPO SITION THE FACT THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THE MISUNDERSTANDING IN THE NEW ORLEANS CONVENTION THE PROPOSAL IN FAVOR OF POLITICAL ACTION FAILED OF ADOPTION BY A CONSIDERABLE MAJORITY IS SIGNIFICANT OF THE POWERFUL SENTIMENT PREVAILING IN THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR AGAINST SUCH ACTION HOWEVER THE DELEGATES OF THE SOCIALISTIC FAITH AND INDEED THE SOCIALISTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY PROCLAIMED THE RESULT OF THE VOTE AT NEW ORLEANS AS A VICTORY FOR THE PRINCIPLE OF POLITICAL ACTION PRESAGING THE CAPTURE OF THE FEDERATION AT AN EARLY DATE THESE REPRESENTATIONS ALTHOUGH LACKING ANY JUSTIFICATION IN THE REAL FACTS OF THE CASE HAD THE EFFECT OF PLACING THE LABOR MOVEMENT IN AN EQUIVOCAL POSITION BEFORE THE COUNTRY IT WAS THEREFORE DETER MINED BY COMMON CONSENT OF THE DELEGATES IN ATTENDANCE AT THE BOSTON CONVENTION OF I903 THAT A DECISIVE TEST SHOULD BE MADE UPON THE ISSUE POLITICS VERSUS TRADEUNIONISM TEN RESOLUTIONS OF A POLITICAL NATURE WERE INTRODUCED DURING THE SESSIONS AT BOSTON WHEN THESE WERE REPORTED BACK TO THE CONVENTION THE COMMITTEE BRIEFLY RECOMMENDED UNFAVORABLE ACTION THE CUSTOM ON PREVIOUS OCCASIONS HAD BEEN TO REPORT SOME FORM OF AMENDMENT TO OR SUB STITUTE FOR THE ORIGINAL RESOLUTIONS THUS LEAVING THE REPORT ITSELF OPEN TO AMENDMENT WITH THE RESULTANT CONFUSION OF THE ISSUES IN THIS INSTANCE THE COMMITTEES OBJECT WAS AS ANNOUNCED BY PRESIDENT GOMPERS IN RULING OUT A PROPOSED SUBSTITUTE TO INSURE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING ON BOTH SIDES THIS RULING OF PRESIDENT GOMPERS WAS TWICE APPEALED FROM AND ON BOTH OCCASIONS IT WAS SUSTAINED BY A LARGE MAJORITY THE CONVENTION THUS EXPRESSING ITS ACCEPTANCE OF THE LINES OF DEBATE SUGGESTED BY ITS PRESIDING OFFICER THE DISCUSSION LASTED NEARLY TWO DAYS THE TONE OF DEBATE WAS SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS IN FORMER INSTANCES ALTHOUGH THERE WAS A MORE NOTABLE TENDENCY ON THE PART OF MANY DELEGATES TO DIS 320 36POLITICAL ACTION AND TRADEUNIONISM CUSS THE MERITS OF SOCIALISM AND THE ATTITUDE TOWARD THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL SOCIALIST INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE LABOR MOVEMENT UPON THE WHOLE HOWEVER THE DEBATE WAS CONFINED TO THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER THE FEDERATION SHOULD COM MIT ITSELF TO POLITICAL ACTION ON PARTY LINES OR PRESERVE ITS IDENTITY AS A PURELY TRADEUNION BODY THE ADOPTION OF THE COMMITTEES REPORT AGAINST POLITICAL ACTION BY A VOTE OF 1128200 TO 214700 THE APPROXIMATE MEMBERSHIP REPRESENTED BY THE DELEGATES VOTING MAY BE REGARDED AS DEMON STRATING THE RESULT OF TEN YEARS CONSTANT AND ACTIVE AGITATION ON THE SUBJECT MAKING EVERY POSSIBLE ALLOWANCE FOR THE UNCERTAIN QUANTITIES THAT ENTER INTO A CALCULATION OF THIS KIND THERE REMAINS A REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT THE VOTE AGAINST POLITICAL ACTION REPRE SENTS AT MOST THE MEAN RATHER THAN THE MAXIMUM OF THE SENTIMENT ON THAT SCORE WHEREAS THE VOTE IN FAVOR OF POLITICAL ACTION MAY BE REGARDED AS OVER RATHER THAN UNDER THE REPRESENTATION TO WHICH THOSE HOLDING THAT VIEW ARE PROPERLY ENTITLED THE NATURE OF THE SUBJECT AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF ITS DISCUSSION BEAR OUT THIS STATE MENT ENTHUSIASM IS PROVERBIALLY AND NATURALLY THE MORE PREVA LENT AMONG THE AGGRESSIVE MINORITY IN ANY CONFLICT OF ARMS OR IDEAS IN ANY CONFLICT INVOLVING A POLITICAL ISSUE THE QUALITY OF ENTHUSIASM IS ESPECIALLY POTENT SINCE POLITICS BEING ESSENTIALLY A MATTER OF FAITH IS LARGELY A MATTER OF INDIVIDUAL LEADERSHIP IN THIS VIEW OF THE SUBJECT IT MAY REASONABLY BE ASSUMED THAT THE LEADERS OF POLITICAL ACTION SENTIMENT IN THE CONVENTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR HAVE DERIVED PART OF THEIR SUPPORT FROM MEN ACTUATED BY A SPIRIT OF ADMIRATION FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP RATHER THAN BY A SENSE OF CONVICTION UPON THE MERITS OF THE IDEAS EXPOUNDED BY THEM THE CONVENTION OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR IS WITHIN THE WIDEST PRACTICABLE LIMITS AN ABSOLUTELY FREE FORUM PRO GRAMMING IS UNKNOWN DEBATE FOLLOWS THE LIMITS OF LATITUDE WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL DELEGATE CHOOSES TO IMPOSE UPON HIMSELF RATHER THAN THE STRICT RULES OF PARLIAMENTARY USAGE THESE CONDITIONS INSURE A PERFECTLY FREE DISCUSSION UPON ALL QUESTIONS MOREOVER THEY ENABLE THE DELEGATES TO EXPLOIT THEIR VIEWS BY DEVICES CALCU LATED TO APPEAL TO THE WISH RATHER THAN TO THE THOUGHT OF THEIR HEARERS ON THE WHOLE IT IS REASONABLY CERTAIN THAT THE VOTE AGAINST POLITICAL ACTION IS FAIRLY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SENTIMENT PREVAIL 32I 37THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY ING AMONG THE TWO MILLION WORKERS AFFILIATED WITH THE FEDERATION TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE PROBABLE SENTIMENT OF THE LABOR ORGANIZATIONS UNAFFILIATED WITH THE LATTER BODY THE MEMBERSHIP OF WHICH MAY BE ESTIMATED AT HALF A MILLION AND DEDUCING THEIR VIEWS UPON THIS SUBJECT FROM THE FACT OF THEIR CONSERVATISM IN OTHER CONNECTIONS IT FOLLOWS THAT THE VOTE HERE NOTED FALLS CON SIDERABLY SHORT OF RECORDING THE FULL STRENGTH OF THE OPPOSITION TO POLITICAL ACTION AMONG THE TRADEUNIONS OF THE UNITED STATES THE POSITION OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR AS GATHERED FROM ITS RECORDS IS THAT WHILE REJECTING THE PROPOSAL OF POLITICAL ACTION BY THE TRADEUNIONS AS FUNDAMENTALLY OPPOSED TO THE PROPER PUR POSE OF THESE BODIES IT FAVORS DISCUSSION AND ACTION UPON LEGISLATIVE LINES IN OTHER WORDS IT SEEKS TO SECURE FAVORABLE LEGISLATION FROM THE EXISTING LEGISLATIVE BODIES WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THEIR POLITICAL MAKEUP LEAVING TO THE INDIVIDUAL TRADEUNIONIST IN HIS CAPACITY AS A CITIZEN THE DUTY OF VOTING AS HIS EXPERIENCE AND JUDGMENT DICTATE AND IF NEED BE OF ORGANIZING WITH HIS FELLOWS FOR THE ATTAINMENT OF POLITICAL ENDS AS A GUIDE TO THE TRADEUNIONS IN SEEKING LEGISLATION AND AS A MEANS OF CONCENTRATING THEIR EFFORTS UPON POINTS OF COMMON AGREEMENT THE FEDERATION HAS DECLARED FOR CERTAIN MEASURES NOT AS IN THE NATURE OF A POLITICAL PROGRAMME BUT SIMPLY AND SPECIFICALLY AS LEGISLATIVE DEMANDS THESE MEASURES AS ADOPTED AT THE DEN VER CONVENTION OF I894 ARE AS FOLLOWS LEGISLATIVE DEMANDS 1 COMPULSORY EDUCATION 2 DIRECT LEGISLATION THROUGH THE INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM 3 A LEGAL WORKDAY OF NOT MORE THAN EIGHT HOURS4 4 SANITARY INSPECTION OF WORKSHOP MINE AND HOME 5 LIABILITY OF EMPLOYERS FOR INJURY TO HEALTH BODY AND LIFE 6 ABOLITION OF THE CONTRACT SYSTEM ON ALL PUBLIC WORKS 7 ABOLITION OF THE SWEATSHOP 8 MUNICIPAL OWNERSHIP OF STREETCARS WATER WORKS AND GAS AND ELECTRIC LIGHT PLANTS FOR PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION OF LIGHT AND HEAT 9 NATIONALIZATION OF TELEGRAPH TELEPHONES RAILROADS AND MINES 10 ABOLITION OF THE MONOPOLY SYSTEM OF LAND HOLDING AND THE SUBSTITUTION THEREFOR OF A TITLE OF OCCUPANCY AND USE ONLY 11 REPEAL OF ALL CONSPIRACY AND PENAL LAWS AFFECTING SEAMEN AND OTHER WORKMEN INCORPORATED IN THE FEDERAL LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES 12 ABOLITION OF THE MONOPOLY PRIVILEGE OF ISSUING MONEY AND SUBSTITUTING THEREFOR A SYSTEM OF DIRECT ISSUANCE TO AND BY THE PEOPLE 4 THIS PROVISION IS INTENDED TO COVER PUBLIC WORKS ONLY AS IN THE CASE OF THE NATIONAL EIGHTHOUR LAW 322 38POLITICAL ACTION AND TRADEUNIONISM THE ADOPTION OF THESE DECLARATIONS DID NOT IMPOSE UPON THE AFFILIATED BODIES ANY OBLIGATION TO DEPART FROM THE PURELY TRADEUNION SPHERE OF ACTION SUCH OBLIGATION AS IS INVOLVED IS PREDICATED UPON THE INDORSEMENT OF THE DECLARATIONS BY THE INDIVIDUAL UNIONS THIS POINT WAS MADE QUITE CLEAR BY PRESIDENT GOMPERS AT THE DENVER CON VENTION WHEN IN REPLY TO A QUESTION DESIGNED TO ELICIT AN AUTHORITA TIVE AND DEFINITE EXPRESSION ON THE SUBJECT HE SAID 5 THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR IS A VOLUNTARY ORGANIZATION THE RESOLU TIONS OR PLATFORMS ADOPTED BY IT AT ITS CONVENTION ARE EXPRESSIVE OF THE CONSENSUS OF OPINION OF THE MAJORITY OF THE ORGANIZED WORKERS AFFILIATED WITH IT THE RESO LUTIONS AND PLATFORMS ADOPTED BY IT CANNOT BE IMPOSED UPON ANY AFFILIATED ORGANIZATION AGAINST ITS WISHES BUT THEY ARE PRESUMED TO BE OBSERVED BY ALL ORGANIZATIONS THE POSITION OF THE FEDERATION IN RESPECT TO THE QUESTION OF POLITICAL ACTION IS FURTHER EXEMPLIFIED BY THAT FEATURE OF ITS CONSTITU TION WHICH BEARS THEREON WHICH READS AS FOLLOWS6 PARTY POLITICS WHETHER THEY BE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLICAN SOCIALISTIC POPU LISTIC PROHIBITION OR ANY OTHER SHALL HAVE NO PLACE IN THE CONVENTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR UPON ALL QUESTIONS OF POLICY AFFECTING THE AMERICAN LABOR MOVE MENT THE EXAMPLE OF THE BRITISH TRADEUNIONISTSIS AN IMPORTANT CON SIDERATION ESPECIALLY IS THIS TRUE WITH REGARD TO THE QUESTION OF POLITICAL POLICY SINCE IT IS TO THAT EXAMPLE THAT THE EXPONENT OF POLITICAL ACTION ON THE PART OF THE AMERICAN TRADEUNIONS MOST FRE QUENTLY REFERS IN JUSTIFICATION OF HIS VIEWS IT IS THEREFORE OF IN TEREST TO NOTE THE CURRENT TENDENCY IN THIS CONNECTION OF THE TRADE UNIONISTS OF GREAT BRITAIN AN AMERICAN PUBLICIST WRITING FROM LONDON UNDER RECENT DATE SAYS 7 NO STATISTICS ARE IN EXISTENCE GIVING THE EXACT STRENGTH OF THE LABOR MOVE MENT HERE IF LONDON WERE AS WELL ORGANIZED AS IS CHICAGO ITS TRADE SOCIETIES WOULD CONTAIN A MEMBERSHIP OF 750000 AT BEST I CAN COUNT ONLY 135000 THE LONDON TRADES COUNCIL HAS A MEMBERSHIP OF 57601 WITH AN INCOME OF 3357 OF WHICH 280 WAS LAST YEAR SPENT FOR THE AID OF LABOR CANDIDATES AND ABOUT 1000 FOR OFFICERS SALARIES BUT LONDON IS DIVIDED INTO TWO CITIES AND TWENTYSEVEN BOROUGHS AND SOME OF THESE HAVE TRADE COUNCILS OF THEIR OWN ACTIVE POLITICAL CENTERS OF INFLUENCE ARE THESE TRADE COUNCILS AND IT SOMETIMES SEEMED TO ME THAT THE POLITICAL SIDE OF THE LABOR MOVEMENT HAD GREATER ATTRACTIONS FOR THE MEMBERS THAN DID THE MATTER OF HOURS OF LABOR AND WAGES S OFFICIAL PROCEEDINGS A F OF L CONVENTION DENVER 1894 6 CONSTITUTION OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR ART III SEC S 7 JUDSON GRENELL LONDON JUNE 4 1904 323 39THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY 40 EVERY PROMINENT LABOR MAN HAS HIS EYE UPON PARLIAMENT HE DESIRES AN OFFICIAL POSITION IN HIS UNION FOR IT IS THE NATURAL STEPPINGSTONE TO BECOMING A COUNCILMAN OR AN ALDERMAN FOR A BOROUGH FROM WHENCE HE NATURALLY STEPS INTO AN OFFICIAL POSITION IN THE COUNTY COUNCIL THEN HE IS READY TO STAND FOR SOME PARLIAMENTARY DISTRICT WHICH NEEDS NOT BE THE ONE IN WHICH HE RESIDES HE IS FREE TO SELECT ANY CONSTITUENCY AND AS STRONG MEN ARE SOUGHT AFTER A MAN WHO HAS MADE A GOOD RECORD IN SUBORDINATE POLITICAL POSITIONS IS SOUGHT AFTER IN CLOSE DISTRICTS IN THE HOPE THAT THE WEIGHT OF HIS POPULARITY MAY HELP TO OVERCOME THE OPPOSITION THESE OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST THAT THE POOR STATE OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION AMONG THE LONDON WORKERS IS EITHER THE EFFECT OF THE CONDITION UNDER WHICH OFFICE IN A TRADEUNION IS REGARDED AS THE NATURAL STEPPINGSTONE TO POLITICAL OFFICE OR THAT THE COMPARATIVE LACK OF INTEREST AMONG THE WORKERS IN THE MATTER OF HOURS OF LABOR AND WAGES IS THE CAUSE OF PERSONAL POLITICAL ACTIVITY AMONG THE WORKERS REPRESENTATIVES THE SITUATION PREVAILING AMONG THE LON DON WORKERS AS HERE DESCRIBED IS TYPICAL OF THAT EXISTING AMONG AMERICAN WORKERS IN ALL SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES THE GROWTH AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE TRADEUNION IS GENERALLY IN INVERSE RATIO TO ITS POLITICAL ACTIVITY OR TO THE POLITICAL ACTIVITY OF THOSE INTRUSTED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF ITS AFFAIRS TO QUOTE FURTHER FROM THE SAME SOURCE 8 IT HAS OFTEN BEEN ASKED WHAT WILL WORKINGMEN DO IF THEY EVER OBTAIN FULL POLITICAL POWER BATTERSEA A CITY OF 171000 INHABITANTS A BOROUGH OF LONDON AND THE HOME OF JOHN BURNS FROM WHICH HE IS REGULARLY RETURNED TO PARLIAMENT ANSWERS THIS QUESTION IN PART HERE THE ORGANIZED LABOR ELEMENT RUNS THINGS ELECTING TWOTHIRDS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGISLATIVE OFFICIALS AND USING THEIR POWER TO THE FULLEST EXTENT POSSIBLE FOR THOSE OBJECTS FOR WHICH TRADEUNIONS AND GOVERNMENTS ARE SUPPOSED TO EXIST THE PLATFORM UPON WHICH PRESUMABLY THE POLITICAL EFFORTS OF THE ORGANIZED WORKERS OF BATTERSEA ARE CENTERED STANDS FOR THESE OBJECTS PUBLIC BATHS PUBLIC WASH HOUSES WORKINGMENS HOMES STERILIZED MILK FOR INFANTS PUBLIC GYMNASIUM AND BILLIARD ROOMS ELECTRIC LIGHTING FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE USE WORKSHOPS FOR MAKING BUILDING AND ROAD MATERIAL PUBLIC LAVATORIES PUBLIC LIBRARIES WORK SHOP INSPECTION WATERWORKS TO SUPPLY THE PUBLIC BATHS LABOR BUREAU THESE ARE NOT TRADEUNION OBJECTS BUT SOCIAL OBJECTS THEY ARE OBJECTS FOR THE ATTAINMENT OF WHICH GOVERNMENTS ARE SUPPOSED 9 JUDSON GRENELL BATTERSEA LONDON JUNE 1 1904 324POLITICAL ACTION AND TRADEUNIONISM TO EXIST BUT THEY ARE NOT OBJECTS WHICH CAN PROPERLY OCCUPY THE CHIEF ATTENTION OF A TRADEUNION WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE DEMANDS FOR WORKSHOPS FOR MAKING BUILDING AND ROAD MATERIALS WORK SHOP INSPECTION AND LABOR BUREAU THE PLATFORM IN QUESTION CON TAINS NOTHING OF INTEREST ESPECIALLY AND PECULIARLY TO THE WORKERS AS SUCH CERTAINLY IT CONTAINS NOTHING OF IMMEDIATE PERSONAL INTEREST TO THE WORKERS OF ANY PARTICULAR CRAFT IT IS A PLATFORM IN WHICH THE PUBLIC AT LARGE IS OR OUGHT TO BE INTERESTED AND FOR THE ATTAINMENT OF WHICH THE PUBLIC SHOULD ORGANIZE TO SAY THAT THE ORGANIZED LABOR ELEMENT RUNS THINGS HAVING IN MIND THE THINGS HERE NOTED IS TO SUGGEST THAT IT IS NEGLECTING THE THINGS WHICH IT OUGHT TO RUN THAT IT IS LETTING THESE THINGS RUN THEMSELVES OR LEAVING THEM TO BE RUN BY OTHER ELEMENTS IN JUDGING THE WORK OF ORGANIZED LABOR IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT THAT THAT WORK IS IN LINE WITH THOSE OBJECTS FOR WHICH GOVERNMENTS ARE SUP POSED TO EXIST OR WITH THOSE OBJECTS CONCERNING WHICH MOST MEN ARE AGREED IN THEORY THE PRIME TEST OF ORGANIZED LABOR CONSISTS NOT IN THE RECORD OF ITS PUBLIC ACTIVITIES NOT IN THE RECORD OF WHAT IT HAS FORCED FROM THE GOVERNMENT IN THE WAY OF LEGISLATION BUT IN THE RECORD OF WHAT IT HAS FORCED FROM THE EMPLOYER IN THE WAY OF HIGHER WAGES SHORTER HOURS AND IMPROVED WORKING CONDITIONS GENERALLYIN SHORT IN THE RECORD OF THAT WHICH ONLY A TRADEUNION CAN DO OT THAT WHICH NO GOVERNMENT CAN DO OF THAT WHICH EVEN THE BEST GOVERNMENT OUGHT NOT TO ATTEMPT TO DO IT IS BY THIS TEST THAT THE STUDENT MUST JUDGE THE CAUSES OF THE STRENGTH OR WEAKNESS OF TRADEUNION SENTIMENT AMONG THE WORKERS IN ANY CRAFT OR LOCALITY AS IT IS BY THIS TEST THAT THE WORKERS THEMSELVES JUDGE THE TRADEUNION AND DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT IT IS OF USE TO THEM AN ORGANIZATION OF WORKERS MAY ACCOMPLISH MUCH GOOD IN SOCIAL AND POLITICAL WAYS YET MAY BE A TRADEUNION IN NAME ONLYMAY IN DEED BE A COMPLETE FAILURE IN ALL THE ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS OF TRADE UNIONISM THERE IS NO NECESSARY CONNECTION BETWEEN SOCIAL LEGISLA TION AND INDUSTRIAL REFORM INDEED TO JUDGE BY THE MORE CONSPICUOUS INSTANCES OF GOVERNMENTAL CONCERN FOR THE WELFARE OF THE WORKING CLASS IT WOULD APPEAR THAT A LOW WAGE RATE AND A LONG WORKDAY ARE NATURAL CONCOMITANTS OF THESE FORMS OF PATERNALISM WHETHER IT BE ATTRIB UTABLE TO COINCIDENCE OR TO CAUSE A FACT OF COMMON OBSERVATION IS THAT IN MANY LOCALITIES IN WHICH ULTRAPROGRESSIVE METHODS OF GOVERN 325 41THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY MENT PREVAIL THERE ALSO PREVAILS A LOW STANDARD OF INDUSTRIAL CONDITIONS THE ADVOCATE OF POLITICAL ACTION BY THE AMERICAN TRADEUNION CITES THE EXAMPLE OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS IN EUROPE WHICH BY THEIR ACTIVITY IN POLITICAL AFFAIRS HAVE COMPELLED THE ENACTMENT OF MUCH REFORM LEGISLATION MEANWHILE IGNORING THE MORE IMPORTANT POINT THAT IN THEIR DEVOTION TO THESE MEASURES THE ORGANIZATIONS IN QUESTION HAVE ABANDONED ALL CONCERN FOR THE IMMEDIATE AND PRIMARY CONDITIONS OF LABOR TO THIS THE OPPONENTS OF POLITICAL ACTION REPLY BY CITING THE RECORD OF THE AMERICAN TRADEUNION IN THE MATTER OF INCREASING WAGES REDUCING THE LENGTH OF THE WORKDAY AND NUMEROUS OTHER IMPROVE MENTS IN THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH LABOR IS PERFORMEDIMPROVE MENTS UNKNOWN TO THE EUROPEAN WORKER OR KNOWN TO HIM ONLY IN HIS DREAMS OF POLITICAL REGENERATIONAND WHICH MAKE MORE IM MEDIATELY AND MORE FUNDAMENTALLY TOWARD THE COMFORT AND INDE PENDENCE OF THE INDIVIDUAL WORKER THAN ANY POLITICAL OR LEGISLATIVE MEASURE CAN POSSIBLY DO IN PRINCIPLE THERE IS LITTLE OR NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND THE PRIVATE MEASURE OF SOCIAL OR DOMESTIC REFORM THE PRINCIPLE IN EACH CASE IS ESSENTIALLY ELEEMOSYNARY THE ULTIMATE EFFECT TO BE ANTICIPATED IN EACH CASE IS THE SAME THE WORKERS WHO REGARD WITH SUSPICION THE PHILANTHROPY OF THE INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYER MAY AND IN FACT DO REGARD WITH EQUAL DISTRUST THE PHILAN THROPY OF THE GOVERNMENT INSPIRED AS BOTH SYSTEMS ARE BY THE SAME MISTAKEN CONCEPTION OF THE WORKERS REAL NEEDS AND BY THE SAME DIS POSITION TO OVERLOOK THE CAUSES OF POVERTY AND DEGRADATION AND HAVING THE SAME SIGNIFICANCE IN THE SUM OF THINGS THE FACT THAT THESE MEASURES OF PUBLIC PHILANTHROPY ARE SECURED THROUGH THE AGENCY OF THE WORKERS ORGANIZATIONS DOES NOT ALTER THEIR CHARACTER DOES NOT MAKE THEM MORE PALATABLE NOR REDEEM THEM IN ANY DEGREE FROM THE ERROR UPON WHICH THEY ARE BASED THAT FACT MERELY COMMITS THE LABOR ORGANIZATION TO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FALSE CONCEPTION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF INDUSTRIAL REFORM AND TO THAT EXTENT WEAKENS THE LABOR ORGANIZATION IN THE ESTEEM OF THOSE WHO SHOULD AND WHO IN THE END MUST DEPEND UPON IT FOR ANY REAL AND PERMANENT REDRESS THE BATTERSEA PLATFORM DECLARES FOR CERTAIN SOCIAL OR PUBLIC RE FORMS AS THE PRIMARY AND ESSENTIAL OBJECTS OF THE BODY SUPPORTING IT WHEREAS THE PLATFORM OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR IN DECLARING FOR SIMILAR OBJECTS ALSO DECLARES THAT THESE ARE SECONDARY AND INCIDENTAL TO THE REAL BUSINESS OF TRADEUNIONISM THIS DIFFER 3261 42POLITICAL ACTION AND TRADEUNIONISM ENCE OF CONCEPTION REGARDING THE FUNDAMENTAL PURPOSE OF THE PLATFORM LEADS THE BATTERSEA TRADEUNIONISTS INTO POLITICS AND KEEPS THE AMER ICAN TRADEUNIONISTS WITHIN THE SPHERE OF TRADEUNIONISM THE IM MEDIATE RESULT OF THIS DIFFERENCE IS SEEN IN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE POLITICAL CLUB AND THE TRADEUNION ITS FINAL RESULT IS SEEN IN THE DIFFER ENCE BETWEEN THE POORLY ORGANIZED CONDITION OF THE WORKERS IN LON DON AND THE WELL ORGANIZED CONDITION OF THE WORKERS IN THE AVERAGE AMERICAN CITY IT IS APPARENT THAT THE COMPARATIVE LACK OF TRADEUNION INTEREST AMONG THE LONDON WORKERS IS THE EFFECT OF UNDUE POLITICAL ACTIVITY ON THE PART OF THOSE ALREADY ORGANIZED OR THEIR REPRESENTATIVES THE STATEMENT THAT EVERY PROMINENT LABOR MAN IN LONDON REGARDS OFFICIAL POSITION IN HIS UNION AS THE NATURAL STEPPINGSTONE TO POLITICAL OFFICE CONTAINS IN ITSELF AMPLE EXPLANATION OF A LACK OF INTEREST IN TRADEUNIONISM THE TRADEUNION OFFICIAL WHO SEEKS POLITICAL OFFICE IS THE BANE OF THE LABOR MOVEMENT THE TRADEUNION WHICH ADOPTS THE POLICY OF POLITICAL ACTION MAKES POLITICAL AMBITION INEVITABLE ON THE PART OF ITS OFFICIALS DEVOTION TO THE PROPER BUSINESS OF TRADE UNIONISM ON THE PART OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES IS ESSENTIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF A TRADEUNION AS IT IS ESSENTIAL TO THE RESPECT AND CONFIDENCE OF ITS MEMBERS AND THEIR FELLOWCRAFTSMEN IT FOLLOWS OF COURSE THAT THE TRADEUNION WHICH WOULD SECURE AND RETAIN THE SERVICES OF EFFICIENT AND DEVOTED MEN MUST GUARD AGAINST IMPOSING UPON ITS OFFICERS ANY DUTIES OR OBLIGATIONS OF A POLITICAL NATURE THERE CAN BE NO INTERMEDIATE FORM OF ORGANIZATION BETWEEN THE TRADEUNION AND THE POLITICAL CLUB NO FORM OF ORGANIZATION CAN COMBINE TRADEUNIONISM AND POLITICS THE TRADEUNION CAN NOT GO INTO POLITICS AND REMAIN A TRADEUNION IF IT WOULD REMAIN A TRADE UNION IT MUST KEEP OUT OF POLITICS IF IT TAKES POLITICAL ACTION IT MUST BECOME TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES A POLITICAL BODY THE TRADEUNION BY STRICT ADHERENCE TO ITS PROPER FUNCTIONS MAY RAISE WAGES SHORTEN THE WORKDAY AND EFFECT NUMEROUS OTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN THE CON DITIONS OF LABOR BUT IN THE VIEW OF THOSE WHO INSIST UPON POLITICAL ACTION THESE RESULTS ARE AFTER ALL MERELY PALLIATIVES UNWORTHY THE DIGNITY AND DESERTS OF THE SOVEREIGN MASSES AND NOT TO BE COMPARED WITH THE BENEFICENT AND WHOLESALE REFORMS OBTAINABLE BY THE SIMPLE PROCESS OF ORGANIZING FOR ONE GREAT STRIKE AT THE BALLOTBOX EVEN ADMITTING THE POWER OF THE GOVERNMENT TO ACCOMPLISH THESE ENDS 327 43THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY THE CONDITION PRECEDENT TO THE EXERCISE OF THAT POWER NAMELY PRAC TICAL UNANIMITY AMONG THE WORKERS UPON QUESTIONS OF POLITICAL PRIN CIPLE AND POLICY IS AN IMPOSSIBILITY A FACT OF WHICH THE ADVOCATES OF POLITICAL ACTION ARE THEMSELVES A SUFFICIENT PROOF SINCE DISSENSION AND DIVISION ARE NOTORIOUSLY THE COMMON FEATURES OF THEIR POLITICAL ACTIVITIES THE ONLY POINT UPON WHICH THERE IS ANY UNANIMITY AMONG THE MEN WHO HOLD THESE VIEWS IS THAT OF HOSTILITY OVERT OR COVERT TO TRADEUNIONISM THE ADOPTION OF POLITICAL ACTION BY THE TRADEUNIONS BY REMOVING THE ONLY GROUND OF COMMON AGREEMENT AMONG THEIR CRITICS WITHIN THE LABOR MOVEMENT WOULD INEVITABLY RESULT IN SPLIT TING THE LATTER INTO AS MANY PARTIES OR FACTIONS AS THERE ARE MEN IN THAT MOVEMENT AMBITIOUS OF LEADERSHIP AND CAPABLE OF COMMANDING A FOLLOWING THE PROPONENTS OF POLITICAL ACTION HOLD THAT LABORS WRONGS ARISE FROM A TWOFOLD SOURCE INDUSTRIAL AND POLITICAL THAT THE ORGANIZA TION OF LABOR TO BE FULLY EFFECTIVE MUST USE THE POLITICAL WEAPON OF THE BALLOT AS WELL AS AND IN PREFERENCE TO THE ECONOMIC WEAPON OF THE STRIKE THAT THE EFFORT TO REFORM THE CONDITIONS OF LABOR BY ECONOMIC METHODS EXCLUSIVELY IS A FAILURE AND THAT THE TRADEUNION BEING ALREADY WELL ESTABLISHED IN THE FIELD OF ECONOMIC EFFORT SHOULD ENTER THE POLITICAL FIELD THE OPPONENTS OF POLITICAL ACTION TAKE THE GROUND THAT POLITICAL MATTERS CAN BE DEALT WITH ONLY BY POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT LABOR ORGANIZATIONS TO BE EFFECTIVE AT ALL MUST CONFINE THEMSELVES TO LABOR MATTERS THAT THE PURELY ECONOMIC POLICY OF THE TRADEUNIONS SO FAR FROM BEING A FAILURE IS A SUCCESS THE PROOFS OF WHICH ARE VISIBLE IN EVERY STEP OF THE WORKERS PROGRESS AND THAT THE TRADEUNION WHICH ENTERS THE POLITICAL FIELD SIMPLY SACRIFICES WHATEVER IMMEDIATE GOOD IT MAY BE CAPABLE OF WITHOUT ACCOMPLISHING ANYTHING OF PROMISE FOR THE FUTURE THE RECORDS OF THE LABOR MOVEMENT CONTAIN NUMEROUS INSTANCES OF FAILURE AND DESTRUCTION DIRECTLY TRACEABLE TO INTERVENTION IN POLITICAL AFFAIRS WHILE THEY CONTAIN NO INSTANCE OF REAL AND PERMANENT AD VANTAGE DUE TO THAT CAUSE THIS RECORD WHILE GENERALLY ADMITTED BY THOSE WHO FAVOR POLITICAL ACTION IS VARIOUSLY ASCRIBED TO PARTY BLUNDER AND INDIVIDUAL DISHONESTY CAUSES WHICH IT WOULD SEEM ARE VERY LARGELY INHERENT IN THE NATURE OF THE SUBJECT AT ANY RATE THE FACTS GO TO PROVE THAT THE MERE TALK OF ORGANIZING THE WORKERS SO THAT 328 44POLITICAL ACTION AND TRADEUNIONISM THEY SHALL VOTE AS ONE MAN IS DANGEROUS TO THE TRADEUNION WHICH INDULGES IN IT WHEREVER TALK OF THAT KIND HAS REACHED THE POINT OF REALIZATION IT HAS RESULTED IN UNDERMINING THE SPIRT OF UNITY UPON WHICH MORE THAN UPON MERE NUMBERS THE TRADEUNION MUST DEPEND IN THOSE TESTS OF PHYSICAL ENDURANCE AND PERSONAL LOYALTY TO WHICH IT MUST INEVITABLY BE SUBJECTED THERE CAN BE NO GAINSAYING THE WISDOM OF THE POLICY ADOPTED AND ADHERED TO BY THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR AND OTHER SUCCESSFUL LABOR ORGANIZATIONS NAMELY THE EXCLUSION FROM THE AFFAIRS OF TRADEUNIONISM OF ALL MATTERS UPON WHICH MEN ARE MORE INCLINED TO DIVIDE THAN TO UNITE THE TRADEUNION GROWS OUT OF THE TRADE IN TEREST SO LONG AS IT IS CONTROLLED BY THAT INTEREST IT IS A BODY WHOSE ELEMENTS ARE COHESIVE AND WHOSE POWER IS CONCENTRATED THE TRADE UNION CONTROLLED OTHERWISE THAN BY THE IMMEDIATE INTERESTS OF ITS MEMBERS IS A MASS OF INCONGRUOUS ELEMENTS WITHOUT POWER PRE CISION OR PERMANENCY THE TRADEUNION WHICH IS ORGANIZED UPON THE BASIS OF COMMON AGREEMENT AMONG THE WORKERS CONCERNING THE CON DITIONS OF LABOR IN A GIVEN INDUSTRY AND WHICH ADHERES TO THAT BASIS IS CAPABLE OF IMPROVING THESE CONDITIONS TO AN EXTENT PROPORTIONED MAINLY TO ITS OWN NUMBERS INTELLIGENCE AND DEVOTEDNESS IN THE END IT IS IMPROVEMENT OF THIS KIND THAT TELLS IN THE PROGRESS OF LABOR GENERALLY THE PRIME USEFULNESS OF THE TRADEUNION CONSISTS NOT IN THE POWER TO ELECT PUBLIC OFFICIALS OR TO SECURE LEGISLATION BUT IN THE POWER TO IMPROVE THE IMMEDIATE AND PERSONAL CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH LABOR IS PERFORMED TO INCREASE WAGES TO REDUCE HOURS TO MAKE SHOP RULES TO MAINTAIN A MEASURE OF EQUALITY IN THE TERMS OF CONTRACT BETWEEN EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE TO INTERPOSE AN ALLEVIATING INFLUENCE BETWEEN MASTER AND MAN AND GENERALLY TO DO THOSE THINGS WHICH ONLY A TRADEUNION CAN DO WHICH THE TRADEUNION MUST DO IF THEY ARE TO BE DONE AT ALL THE FUNDAMENTAL ERROR UPON WHICH POLITICAL ACTION IS BASED CON SISTS IN CREDITING GOVERNMENT WITH THE POWER TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THAT NOW AFFECT THE RELATIONS BETWEEN EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE SO LONG AS THE PEOPLE EXERCISE THE CONTROLLING INFLUENCE IN GOVERNMENT THE WISDOM OF THE LATTER CAN NOT RISE ABOVE THAT OF THE PEOPLE THEM SELVES NOR CAN ITS POWERS EXCEED THOSE DELEGATED TO IT BY THE PEOPLE UPON THE THEORY THAT LIES AT THE ROOT OF A GOVERNMENT OF LIMITED POWERS TO WIT THAT IN THE PEOPLE RESIDES THE SOURCE OF ALL AUTHORITY 329 45THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY IT IS OBVIOUS THAT NO GOVERNMENT CAN BE WISE ENOUGH OR STRONG ENOUGH TO DO FOR ITS CONSTITUENTS THAT WHICH THE LATTER ARE NOT WISE ENOUGH OR STRONG ENOUGH TO DO FOR THEMSELVES TO QUESTION THESE PRINCIPLES IS TO QUESTION THE POWERNAY THE RIGHTOF THE PEOPLE TO GOVERN THEMSELVES THE THEORY OF GOVERNMENTAL CONTROL IN THE INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS OF THE PEOPLE WHILE LOGICAL ENOUGH IN ITS ORIGINTHAT IS IN EUROPEAN CONCEPTIONS OF GOVERNMENTIS DIRECTLY OPPOSED TO THE GENIUS OF AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS PRECISELY AS THE AMERICAN CITIZEN LEADS IN THE POLITICAL CONCEPTION OF GOVERNMENT AS AN AGENCY RE STRICTED TO THE PERFORMANCE OF CERTAIN MORE OR LESS CLEARLY DEFINED FUNCTIONS OF A PUBLIC NATURE SO THE AMERICAN WORKER LEADS IN THE IN DUSTRIAL CONCEPTION OF TRADEUNIONISM AS AN AGENCY WHICH BOTH OF RIGHT AND OF NECESSITY MUST DISCHARGE THE FUNCTIONS APPERTAINING TO THE INDUSTRIAL PHASE OF SOCIETY THE PSYCHOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE SENTIMENT FOR POLITICAL ACTION IS TO BE FOUND IN THAT INTELLECTUAL DESPAIR TO WHICH ALL MEN ARE MOMEN TARILY SUBJECT IN THEIR TREATMENT OF PROBLEMS WHICH PRESS FOR SOLUTION BUT WHICH DEFY ALL KNOWN FORMULAS WHERE INSTINCT COMMANDS AND REASON FAILS THE DISPOSITION TO APPEAL TO EXTRINSIC SOURCES OF AID BECOMES STRONG THE ATTITUDE OF THE AMERICAN TRADEUNIONIST IS THAT OF APPEAL TO THE SPIRIT OF INDEPENDENCE AND TO A REALIZATION OF THE TRUTH THAT THE WORKERS ARE THEMSELVES THE SOLE REPOSITORY OF POWER TO BETTER THEIR LOT THE SOLEMN LESSON OF HISTORY TODAY AND EVERY DAY OF OUR LIVES IS THAT THE WORKERS MUST DEPEND UPON THEMSELVES FOR THE IMPROVE MENT OF THE CONDITIONS OF LABOR THEIR POWER INHERES IN LABOR NOT IN THE BALLOT IT IS THE POWER TO PRODUCE AND IN THE LAST ANALYSIS THE POWER TO STOP PRODUCTION TO CONSERVE AND CONCENTRATE THAT POWER IS THE FIRST AND LAST DUTY OF TRADEUNIONISM THE FORCES THAT DOMI NATE SOCIETY ARE PHYSICAL NOT INTELLECTUAL THE LABOR PROBLEM CAN NOT BE SOLVED BY RULE AND FORMULA IT CAN ONLY BE SOLVED THROUGH CON STANT LABOR AND MORE OR LESS CONTINUAL SUFFERING YOU CAN NOT SOLVE THE LABOR PROBLEM BY THE BALLOT NOR BY THE BULLET AS WELL MIGHT YOU TRY TO APPEASE HUNGER BY THE INTELLECTUAL PROCESS OF READING A MENU OR BY THE PHYSICAL PROCESS OF DESTROYING THE PALATE W MACARTHUR SAN FRANCISCO CAL 330 46

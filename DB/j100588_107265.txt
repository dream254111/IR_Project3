J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107265,DESCRIPTION OF A REFLECTIVE GONIOMETER,I206964,XVI DESCRIPTION OF A REFLECTIVE GONIOMETER BY WILLIAM HYDE WOLLASTON M D SEC R S READ JUNE 8 1809 FRROM THE ADVANCES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE OF LATE YEARS IN CRYSTALLOGRAPHY A VERY LARGE PROPORTION OF MINERAL SUBSTANCES MAY NOW BE RECOGNISED IF WE CAN ASCERTAIN THE ANGULAR DI MENSIONS OF TLHEIR EXTERNAL FORMS OR THE RELATIVE POSITION OF THOSE SURFACES THAT ARE EXPOSED BY FRACTURE BUT THOUGH THE MODIFICATIONS OF TETRAHEDRONS OF CUBES AND OF THOSE OTHER RE GULAR SOLIDS TO WHICH THE ADVENTITIOUS AID OF GEOMETRY COULD BE CORRECTLY APPLIED HAVE BEEN DETERMINED WITH THE UTMOST PRECISION YET LIT HAS BEEN OFTEN A SUBJECT OF REGRET THAT OUR INTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING THE ANGLES OF CRYSTALS ARE NOT POS SESSED OF EQUAL ACCURACY AND THAT IN APPLYING THE GONIOMETER TO SMALL CRYSTALS WHERE THE RADIUS IN CONTACT WITH THE SURFACE IS NECESSARILY VERY SHORT THE MEASURES EVEN WHEN TAKEN WITH A STEADY HAND WILL OFTEN DEVIATE TOO MUCH FROM THE TRUTH TO AID US IN DETERMINING THE SPECIES TO WHICH A SUBSTANCE BE LONGS A MEANS OF REMEDYING THIS DEFECT HAS LATELY OCCURRED TO ME BY WHICH IN MOST CASES THE INCLINATION OF SURFACES MAY BE MEASURED AS EXACTLY AS IS WANTED FOR COMMON PURPOSES AND WHEN THE SURFACES ARE SUFFICIENTLY SMOOTH TO REFLECT A DIS TINCT IMAGE OF DISTANT OBJECTS THE POSITION OF FACES ONLY Z OF DCCCIX AL IDR WOLLASTONS DESCRIPTION OF A AN INCH IN BREADTH MAY BE DETERMINED WITH AS MUCH PRECISION AS THOSE OF ANY LARGER CRYSTALS FOR THIS PURPOSE THE RAY OF LIGHT REFLECTED FROM THE SUR FACE IS EMPLOYED AS RADIUS INSTEAD OF THE SURFACE ITSELF AND ACCORDINGLY FOR A RADIUS OF 5 OF AN INCH WE MAY SUBSTITUTE EITHER THE DISTANCE OF THE EYE FROM THE CRYSTAL WHICH WOULD NATURALLY BE ABOUT TWELVE OR FIFTEEN INCHES OR FOR GREATER ACCURACY WE MAY BY A SECOND MODE SUBSTITUTE THE DISTANCE OF OBJECTS SEEN AT A HUNDRED OR MORE YARDS FROM US THE INSTRUMENT WHICH I USE CONSISTS OF A CIRCLE GRADUATED ON ITS EDGE AND MOUNTED ON A HORIZONTAL AXLE SUPPORTED BY AN UPRIGHT PILLAR PLATE XI THIS AXLE BEING PERFORATED ADMITS THE PASSAGE OF A SMALLER AXLE THROUGH IT TO WHICH ANY CRYSTAL OF MODERATE SIZE MAY BE ATTACHED BY A PIECE OF WAX WITH ITS EDGE OR INTERSECTION OF THE SURFACES HORIZONTAL AND PARALLEL TO THE AXIS OF MOTION THIS POSITION OF THE CRYSTAL IS FIRST ADJUSTED SO THAT BY TURN ING THE SMALLER AXLE EACH OF THE TWO SURFACES WHOSE INCLI NATION IS TO BE MEASURED WILL REFLECT THE SAME LIGHT TO THE EYE THE CIRCLE IS THEN SET TO ZERO OR 180O BY AN INDEX ATTACHED TO THE PILLAR THAT SUPPORTS IT THE SMALL AXLE IS THEN TURNED TILL THE FURTHER SURFACE RE FLECTS THE LIGHT OF A CANDLE OR OTHER DEFINITE OBJECT TO THE EYE AND LASTLY THE EYE BEING KEPT STEADILY IN THE SAME PLACE THE CIRCLE IS TURNED BY ITS LARGER AXLE TILL THE SECOND SURFACE REFLECTS THE SAME LIGHT THIS SECOND SURFACE IS THUS ASCER TAINED TO BE IN THE SAME POSITION AS THE FORMER SURFACE HAD BEEN THE ANGLE THROUGH WHICH THE CIRCLE HAS MOVED IS IN FACT THE SUPPLEMENT TO THE INCLINATION OF THE SURFACES BUT AS W54RTECTIVE GONIOLETLER THE GRADUATIONS ON ITS MARGIN ARE NUMBERED ACCORDINGLY IN AN INVERTED ORDER THE ANGLE IS CORRECTLY SHEWN BY THE INDEX WITHOUT NEED OF ANY COMPUTATION IT MAY HERE BE OBSERVED THAT IT IS BY NO MEANS NECESSARY TO HAVE A CLEAN UNIFORM FRACTURE FOR THIS APPLICATION OF THE IN STRUMENT TO THE STRUCTURE OF LAMINATED SUBSTANCES FOR SINCE ALL THOSE SMALL PORTIONS OF A SHATTERED SURFACE THAT ARE PARALLEL TO ONE ANOTHER THOUGH NOT IN THE SAME PLANE GLISTEN AT ONCE WITH THE SAME LIGHT THE ANGLE OF AN IRREGULAR FRACTULRE MAY BE DETERMINED NEARLY AS WELL AS WHEN THE REFLECTING FRAG MENTS ARE ACTUALLY IN THE SAME PLANE IN THIS METHOD OF TAKING THE MEASURE OF AN ANGLE WHEN THE EYE AND CANDLE ARE ONLY TEN OR TWELVE INCHES DISTANT A SMALL ERROR MAY ARISE FROM PARALLAX IF THE INTERSECTION OF THE PLANES OR EDGE OF THE CRYSTAL BE NOT ACCURATELY IN A LINE WITH THE AXIS OF MOTION  BUT SUCH AN ERROR MAY BE RENDERED IN SENSIBLE EVEN IN THAT MODE OF USING THE INSTRUMENT BY DUE CARE IN PLACING THE CRYSTAL AND WHEN THE SURFACES ARE SUFFI CIENTLY SMOOTH TO REFLECT A DISTINCT IMAGE OF OBJECTS ALL ERROR FROM THE SAME SOURCE MAY BE ENTIRELY OBVIATED BY ANOTHER METHOD OF USING IT FOR THIS PURPOSE IF THE EYE BE BROUGHT WITHIN ABOUT AN INCH OF THE REFLECTING SURFACE THE REFLECTED IMAGE OF SOME DISTANT CHIMNEY MAY BE SEEN INVERTED BENEATH ITS TRUE PLACE AND BY  I CANNOT OMIT MENTIONING THAT MR SOWERBY HAD THOUGHT OF EMPLOYING REFEC LION FOR THIS PURPOSE NEARLY AT THE SAME TIME AS MYSELF BUT DID NOT SUCCEED TO HIS SATISFACTION IN CONSEQUENCE OF AN ATTEMPT TO FIX THE POSITION OF THE EYE FOR WHEN THE LINE OF SIGHT IS DETERMIRJED BY A POINT CONNECTED WITH THE APPARATUS THE RADIUS EMPLOYED IS THEREBY LIMITED TO THE EXTENT OF THE INSTRUMENT AND THE ERROR FROM PARAL LAX IS MANIFESTLY INCREASED LI1 2GO256 DR WOLLASTONS DESCRIPTION OF A TURNING THE SMALL AXLE MAY BE BROUGHT TO CORRESPOND APPA RENTLY WITH THE BOTTOM OF THE HOUSE OR WITH SOME OTHER DIS TANT HORIZONTAL LINE IN THIS POSITION THE SURFACE ACCURATELY BISECTS THE ANGLE WHICH THE HEIGHT OF THAT HOUSE SUBTENDS AT THE EYE OR RATHER AT THE REFLECTING SURFACE THEN BY TURN ING THE WHOLE CIRCLE AND CRYSTAL TOGETHER THE OTHER SURFACE HOWEVER SMALL MAY BE BROUGHT EXACTLY INTO THE SAME POSI TION AND THE ANGLE OF THE SURFACES MAY THUS BE MEASURED WITH A DEGREE OF PRECISION WHICH HAS NOT HITHERTO BEEN EX PECTED IN GONIOMETRY THE ACCURACY INDEED OF THIS INSTRUMENT IS SUCH THAT A CIRCLE OF MODERATE DIMENSIONS WITH A VERNIER ADAPTED TO IT WILL PROBABLY AFFORD CORRECTIONS TO MANY FORMER OBSERVA TIONS I HAVE ALREADY REMARKED ONE INSTANCE OF A MIS TAKE THAT PREVAILS RESPECTING THE COMMON CARBONATE OF LIME AND I AM INDUCED TO MENTION IT BECAUSE THIS SUBSTANCE IS VERY LIKELY TO BE EMPLOYED AS A TEST OF THE CORRECTNESS OF SUCH A GONIOMETER BY ANY ONE WHO IS NOT CONVINCED OF ITS ACCURACY FROM A DISTINCT CONCEPTION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF ITS CONSTRUCTION THE INCLINATION OF THE SURFACES OF A PRIMITIVE CRYSTAL OF CAR BONATE OF LIME IS STATED WITH GREAT APPEARANCE OF PRECISION TO BE LO1 E8 40 A RESULT DEDUCED FROM THE SUPPOSED POSITION OF ITS AXIS AT AN ANGLE OF 45 WITH EACH OF THE SURFACES AND FROM OTHER SEDUCING CIRCUMSTANCES OF APPARENT HARMONY BY SIMPLE RATIOS BUT HOWEVER STRONG THE PRESUMPTION MIGHT BE THAT THIS ANGLE WHICH BY MEASUREMENT APPROACHES TO 45 IS ACTUALLY SO IT MUST NEVERTHELESS BE IN FACT ABOUT 450O O FOR I FIND THE INCLINATION OF THE SURFACES TO EACH OTHER IS VERY NEARLY IF NOT ACCURATELY IO5 AS IT WAS FORMERLY DETERMINEDREFLECTIVE GONIOMETER S25 TO BE BY HUYGENS  AND SINCE THE MEASURE OF THE SUPERFICIAL ANGLE GIVEN BY SIR ISAAC NEWTON CORRESPONDS WITLI THIS DETERMINATION OF HUYGIENS HIS EVIDENCE MAY BE CONSIDERED AS A FURTHER CONFIRMATION OF THE SAME RESULT FOR IT MAY BE PRESUMED THAT HE WOULD NOT ADOPT THE MEASURES OF OTHERS WITHOUT A CAREFUL

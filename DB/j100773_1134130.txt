j100773,Journal of the American Institute of Criminal Law and Criminology,1134130,A Case of Identity,i247498,A CASE OF IDENTITY WILLIAM RENWICK RIDDELL The most extraordinary criminal case in many respects in Upper Canada was that of a person charged with crimes committed by William Townsend2 William Townsend was born near Fort Porter now Black Rock in the State of New York in 1828 His father Robert Townsend was of good stock being descended from Sir Roger Townsend3 who landed at Plymouth in 1530 Robert born in Massachusetts came witli his brothers to Buffalo during the war of 1812 he was a car penter and shipwright and enjoyed an excellent reputation all his life He married Mary Ann Wright the widow of an American soldier who had been killed during the war along with her brother William Caskey at Fort Porter The Caskeys were descendents of Joseph Caskey a Church of England missionary whose church was burned by the Indians he escaped to live a missionary for over fifty years Robert Townsend bought land near Fort Porter and there three of his children were born William being the eldest Then he crossed the international line and worked on the Welland Canal taking part in building the docks at Port Dalhousie Afterwards he bought land known later as the May Farm some two miles from Port Dalhousie and built a house on it in which he lived with his family for a time The frame work of the old Townsend house was still standing a few years ago Selling out this farm he bought some wild land between Canboro Village and Canfield where he lived until his death in 1844 When about thirteen William joined the government ship Mohawk as a helper in the galley etc Leaving the service in 1844 he helped on his fathers farm near Canfield for two years dur Justice of the Supreme Court of Ontario Toronto Can 2The facts of this curious case are taken from contemporary newspaper reports of the two trials the official record at Welland two contemporary pamphlets containing accounts an article in the Peoples Press published at Welland January 19 1915 on the Townsend Gang by The Old Timer and an answer in the same paper May 25 1915 by a Niece of Bill Townsend and material derived from private inquiry I have tested the information and believe what is set out in the present article will be found accurate The Judges Notebook is not available Mr Justice McLean kept the notes of the civil and the criminal cases in different books and that containing the latter seems to have been lost Valde deflendus 3Sir Roger Townsend seems unknown to the biographersA CASE OF IDENTITY 543 ing his fathers last illness On the death of his father in 1846 NWilliam joined the government ship Montreal as a secondclass boy he deserted in 1848 but rejoined the Mohawk in 1849 remained but three months and then again deserted when in Cleveland because he had been ordered to paint the ships bottom with red ochre He had been entered in the ships books as William Townsend but was always known by the name Little Davy Crockett his conduct is said to have been good while in the service After leaving the government employ he worked on the farm sailed a little worked in saw mills as a cooper etc He was not a good workman but rather a jackofalltrades He was also for a time a cab driver in Hamilton drove the stage from Hamilton to Cayuga and did some trading on the Welland Canal but had no steady employment He was an apt mimic and could imitate many dialects his great delight was to play the violin or tambourine and bones to black up and sing and dance as a Nigger Minstrel He formed a Nigger Minstrel Troupe and gave concerts round the country These seem to have pleased the people as one lady swore she attended eleven of the entertainments probably the art was not of a high grade however He does not seem to have fallen a victim to the then national vice of drunkenness4 but in other respects he became depraved With others he formed a gang of pickpockets and thieves operating in Hamilton and around Canfield of this gang it is probable he was not the leading spirit that place seems to have been held by one Lettice an Englishman who came to the Townsend place under the name of Anderson there were also persons of the names of King Blowes Bryson Patterson and Weaver who seem to have made up the number of members While many depredations were committed blood was not so far as known shed by the gang until October 18545 On the Talbot Road a few miles west of Cayuga lived at Nelles Corners John Ham ilton Nelles a member of one of the most respectable families of Upper 4The Niece of Bill Townsend says Townsends troubles commenced when he started going to a hotel in Cayugajust as all young men do when they start drinking that awful curse whiskyand she adds that on the night of Nelles murder Townsend had been drinking Townsends whiskey was talking but at the trials some who knew him well testified that he did not drink 5After the murder of Nelles and Richards there arose memories of many other murders supposed to have been committed by the Townsend Gang or the Notorious Bill Townsend Bryson the Queens Evidence swore at the first trial that Townsend told him that he had shot five men once in one house for dead men tell no tales but no other homicide than those of Nelles and Richards has ever been traced to him or his gang 543 A CASE OF IDENTITY544 WILLIAM RENWICK RIDDELL Canada and himself of high standing in the community A knock came at the door in the night of October 18 1854 Nelles first opened the door and then closed it it was pushed open and five men entered One said You are the scoundrel who shut the door in my face and immediately shot NellesG The robbers then took what money there was also a gold watch and opened a trunk in search for valuables Nelles died in a few hours The gang fled they had committed several robberies on the same day Blowes was caught in Hamilton in the house of one Mrs Mary Ann Arno or Arnold otherwise known as Limping Jenny a lady whose reputation limped worse than her name King was captured at his fathers farm near Barrie about 70 miles north of Toronto Lettice was shot and killed by a constable on Squaw Island7 when attempting to escape and Bryson was taken in Hamilton Bryson King and Blowes were tried at Cayuga for murder and convicted King and Blowes were hanged while Brysons sentence was commuted to imprisonment in the penitentiary for life See Note 12 post Townsend first went home then went to St Catharines and probably to Buffalo and later concealed himself for a time at the house of his brotherinlaw John Horn at length on November 2nd he came out of hiding and made a break for freedom Going with a man who was afterwards identified as Lettice toward Port Robin son they met Jacob Gainer who had sold a load of wheat there and robbed him of his money Townsend telling him that he had shot a man at Nelles Comers and needed the money to get out of the country The two fugitives went on to Port Robinson and had dinner at the Jordan House Gainer laid an information before Mr James McCoppen J P he called Charles Richards a constable who went at once to the Jordan House followed by McCoppen Asking 0It is possible that the person who actually shot Nelles was Lettice or Anderson but the evidence points directly to Townsend that Townsend killed Richards there never was any doubt 7Lettice as will appear below went with Townsend when he made a break for freedom The constables searching for Townsend along the Canadian border at Fort Erie Bridgeburg etc heard that a man had been seen on the river bank They took a small boat and rowed over to Squaw Island to see if he had gone there They found a young man on the island who ran from them he refused to stop when called on to do so and climbed upon a barn where he was shot by the pursuing constables He was positively recognized as Lettice but there always has been a doubt One story is that Lettice died some years after in Chicago having assumed the name of Town send before his death He is said to have stated that his real name was Anderson that he had shot a man near Welland and had robbed many stores in Ontario etc Such stories are not infrequent it is not worth while here to discuss the truth of this 544 WILLIAM RENWICK RIDDELLA CASE OF IDENTITY 545 Mr Jordan if there were any strangers in the house he was informed of the two who were there When one of them came out of the bar McCoppen entered into conversation with him and Richard recogniz ing him as Townsend laid his hand on him Townsend turned around and said Let go of me or you are a dead man Richard retained his hold and Townsend shot him dead and made his escape A large reward was offered for the arrest of the criminals including Townsend His immediately subsequent movements are not known but a day or two thereafter he boarded a train on the Great Western Railway from Hamilton to Windsor This fact was telegraphed along the line and at Woodstock the sheriff and the gaoler with four assistants went on the train and found him By most con summate assurance he lulled their suspicions said he knew they took him for Townsend but that he was a traveller from east of Rochester going west He came upon the platform talking easily and with a smile and jollied them along until the train had acquired a good rate of speed then he darted away like a deer and leaped on the last platform of the last car By almost incredible stupidity and ineptitude the Woodstock authorities did not telegraph what had happened He was it is believed seen by an old schoolmate George May in Chicago coming off the cars in the fall of 1854 He asked May not to call him Townsend giving a name with a Mac in it and said he was on his way to New Orleans and from there to Australia or California No information of this however came to the authorities till long afterwards The next heard of him was in August 1855 when the sheriff at Rock Island Illinois thought he found him in the person of an actor in one of the side shows of Stone and Van Amburgs Circus and Menagerie as he mentioned the fact in confidence to the proprietor of the show and the proprietor repeated it in confidence to the ringmaster the fact was ultimately repeated in confidence to the suspected person who promptly disappeared before a Canadian officer could arrive It was believed at the time that he had gone to California by the Overland Route but this was never verified The next act in the drama was played in Ohio One morning in April 1857 on the train on the Columbus and Cleveland Railway leaving Columbus about 130 a m the conductor Knowlton found a man who had no ticket and no money to pay his fare 350 He told the conductor he had come from Nicaragua and offered his A CASE OF IDENTITY 545546 WILLIAM RENWICK RIDDELL Colts revolver fully loaded and freshly capped8 as a pledge for the amount of his fare The conductor fautc de nmieux took the pistol and shortly after the arrival of the train at Cleveland about 8 a m the passenger came to Kiiowltons liouse for his pistol but as he had no money Knowlton refused to give it to him The man came back again and Knowlton refusing to go with him to River street a rather disreputable place where he said he had a friend who would help him to raise the wind took him to a hotel kept by John Iles at 110 Erie street Iles had previously lived in Canada and knew Townsend well He was washing some tumblers when the conductor and his passenger came in and he was so startled at seeing the man whom he took for Townsend that he let one of the glasses fall Iles told him to go and get his supper and he himself ran and informed the police The man was arrested later identified by wit nesses from Canada and extradited During his six months incarceration in the Gaol at Cayuga awaiting the Fall Assizes he was visited by many of the friends and acquaintances of William Townsend including his mother Mrs David Dewar his stepfather David Dewar his brotherinlaw James B Smith and his sisters Mrs Smith and Francis Townsend all persons of respectability They all insisted that the prisoner was not Townsend Many of Townsends old acquaintences on the other hand were equally confident that the prisoner was Townsend and the countryside was divided into two factions FThe prisoner was very reticent he said his name was Robert J McHenry that he had come from near Glasgow Scotland and had 8To those who are accustomed to the breachloading revolver with fixed ammunition it sounds odd to speak of a revolver as being capped but in my early boyhood the revolver was muzzle loaded and had percussion caps Fixed or metallic ammunition came into fairly common use in the 60s I used it myself in the Remington four shooter and single barrel as early as 1865 but the Colt revolver was not made for firing such ammunition until after 1870 The first U S Army Colt for metallic cartridges called the 45 caliber Colt Army Revolver was tested 1871 to 1874 before being adopted by the Army and in this the chamber of the cylinder had to be loaded with cartridges one by one from the rear This Colt was very much like the celebrated Colt Frontier caliber 44 of which many hundred thousand were sold The Colt Navy revolver had cap and ball cylinders until the late 70s when some of them were converted into metallic cartridge weapons The modern Navy revolver with its cylinder allowing all the empty shells to be ejected in one act and reloading by a loading pack was adopted as late as 1889 The late adoption of the metallic cartridge for Colt revolvers was due to the patents of Lindner 1854 Rollin White 1855 and Mayall 1860  but Colt made 65000 Burdan rifles with such ammunition for the Russian government about 18681871 546 WILLIAM RENWICK RIDDELLA CASE OF IDENTITY 547 been with Walker9 in Nicaragua but he refused to give any further account of himself He was perfectly confident of acquittal retained no lawyer and subpoenaed no witnesses The Fall Assizes came round a true bill was found against William Townsend for the murder of John Hamilton Nelles the prisoner was arraigned under the name of William Townsend and under that name pleaded Not Guilty announcing himself ready for his trial without counsel or witnesses This course astonished the Assize judge Mr afterwards Chief Justice McLean and the Soli citor GeneralT0 Henry Smith who was conducting the prosecution for the Crown Fortunately for him Mr S B Freeman an able and 9William Walker the last of the Filibusters was born in Nashville fenn May 8 1824 of Scottish parentage He became a doctor lawyer and journalist practicing medicine in Nashv ille and Philadelphia law and jour nalism in New Orleans and in 1850 became editor of the San Francisco Herald He also practiced law in California In 1853 with a band of some 170 followers le invaded Lower California and Sonora Mexico but was driven out by Mexican troops In 1855 he invaded Nicaragua Central America with 56 followers and in 1856 he was elected president of that socalled republic Defeated towards the end of the same year by the Legitimists of Nicaragua assisted by the Costa Ricans he went to Panama After two attempts to recover the country which were rendered futile by the interven tion of the United States largely at the instance of Vanderbilt he ultimately in August 1860 again invaded Nicaragua Captured in September by Captain Salmon of the British warship Icarus he was delivered to the authorities of Nicaragua tried by court martial and shot at Trujillo September 12 1860 His own work The War in Nicaragua published in 1860 must be read with caution but a very full and satisfactory account is given of this last and greatest of American filibusters in The Story of the Filibusters by James Jeffrey Roche London T Fisher Unwin 1891 Assuming that the prisoner was the McHenry of Chips Flats California as sworn at the second trial it was not impossible that he had been with Walker in Nicaragua The last account we have of McHenry at Chips Flats is in October 1854 Valker sailed from San Francisco for Nicaragua with the Immortal Fiftysix in the brig Vesta May 5 1855 and while it was not till May 1857 that he left Nicaragua some of his soldiers had already gone home disheartened with the failing fortunes of their leader But there were hundreds even thousands who claimed to have been with Walker in Nicaragua who had never seen him many accounted in that way for an otherwise unexplainable absence from the view of their friends and there have been since that time as many last survivors of Walkers Expedition as of the Light Brigade of Balaclava fame 10In the early times of the province the law officers of the crown i e the attorney general and the socilitor general claimed the right to conduct all prosecutions for the crown and incidentally received the rather substantial fees for such services But as the province became better settled and the number of courts increased it was found necessary to retain other counsel and gradually the law officers began to omit to conduct prosecutions By the time of those trials it was unusual for either attorney general or solicitor general to take the crown briefs except in very important casesthe solicitor general in opening said The present inquiry is a most important one so much so that the government have thought fit to request me to attend to conduct the case although I am not in the habit of going the circuit Smith lived in Kingston There has been no instance for many years of a law officer of the crown taking a criminal prosecutioncertainly none in my time thirtyfive years A CASE OF IDENTITY 547548 WILLIAM RENWICK RIDDELL brilliant barrister of Hamilton was attending the Assizes After the arraignment when the prisoner liad been remanded for trial on the following day a number of those interested in him spoke to Mr Freeman and he voluntarily undertook the duty of conducting the defense associating with him Mr Start also of HIamilton a barrister of good standing and great ability There was no difficulty in proving that Townsend had been present at the murder of Nelles and if not the actual perpetrator of the deed was aiding and abetting the sole defense was that the prisoner was not Townsend The prisoner was a man of about 5 feet 7 inches in height his complexion was somewhat pale his cheeks were thin his face was elongated but cheerful his eyes large and of a peculiar light blue his hair dark brown and eyebroNs of a lighter tint not meeting over the nose but well arched his forehead large heavy and somewhat higlh his nose large thlick at the top and rather bent from the bridge downward He had a scar above his left eyebrow about an inch long and inclining toward the temple and another of the same size on his under lip his chin was long and prominent his cheekbones rather high and from the left cheek bone there was a large broad scar nearly three inches long and extending downwards All witnesses agreed that he was thinner and paler than Townsend There was little difficulty in obtaining a jury the Crown did not challenge and the defense challenged only those who had expressed opinions and few from certain neighborhoods In an experience of thirtyfive years I have never known it took more than half an hour to procure a jury in a murder case in this province1 Bryson who turned Queens evidence12 and who was brought from the Kingston penitentiary identified the prisoner most posi There is nothing which more amazes an Ontario barrister in the practice of some of the courts of the United States than the extraordinary length of time taken in procuring a jury we a busy and poor people could never afford the time Every prisoner is allowed to have g copy of the jury panel four days before the sitting of the court and is expected to have his objections ready while we do not allow the examination of jurymen by counsel on either side 12When Bryson was arrested he made a full confession he was tried convicted and sentenced to death at the same assizes as Blowes and King his confession was not used against him His youth aroused sympathy and petitions were presented to the governor general by William Lyon MacKenzie M P P the wellknown rebel of 1837 Joseph Curran Morrison M P P afterwards Mr Justice Morrison and many others and apparently influenced by his youth and his frank and full confession Brysons sentence was May 3 1855 commuted to imprisonment for life While he was not called as a witness against King and Blowes he was 548 WILLIAM RENWICK RIDDELLA CASE OF IDENTITY 549 tively but gave the important evidence that Townsend wore earrings the nine months he knew him that he wore them when he shot Nelles and took them out at Buffalo at the United States Hotelthere were no holes in the prisoners ears or any indication that there ever had been Another convict was equally positive as were eighteen other witnesses nearly all of whom had known Townsend well including the captain of his Militia Company and six thought him to be Town send but would not swear to the identity This evidence took up the first day and part of the second September 24 and 25 1857 During the first day the prisoner was allowed to wear his beard but the Crown prosecutor ordered him to be shaved before the second days proceedings began at first the prisoner objected to this but finally yielded with good grace The evidence of identity on the first day was general but the second witness Wait on the second day deposed that Townsend had a scar from the joint of the large toe of the right foot to the ball of the foot the prisoners boot being removed a scar much such as had been described but a little smaller was manifest That Townsend had such a scar was sworn to by another witness who said it had been caused by a coopers adze The next witness Brooks described a scar above the left eyebrow of Townsend and pointed out to the jury a similar scar on the prisoner the next witness corroborated this as did four others That Townsend had a scar on the lower lip like the prisoner was sworn to by only one witnessand he seems to have been unreliable that he had a scar on the left cheek was deposed to by four persons one saying that it had been caused by a burn one witness had never seen such a scar on Tounsends face and another was not sure Thirtytwo witnesses were called for the Crown in all For the defense fortynine witnesses were called most of whom knew Townsend well and all of whom swore the prisoner was not he Townsends mother stepfather brotherinlaw and two sisters were amongst those called All gave general evidence but many gave reasons for their belief as well No one seems to have known of the scar on the right foot but two admitted the scar over Townsends left eye There was a consensus of opinion that Townsends eyes were brought up from Kingston penitentiary as a witness on the two Townsend trials He identified the prisoner without hesitation or equivocation He said on his examination that he hoped that he might be pardoned because I know I did not commit the murder but I expect no reward for giving testimony he was pardoned June 22 1868 after serving more than thirteen years I do not know anything of his subsequent history A CASE OF IDENTITY 549550 WILLIAM RENWICK RIDDELL blacker than those of the prisoner being described as black dark hazel dark gray not quite jet black etc very different from the prisoners blue eyes The witnesses agreed that Townsends hair was dark almost black and straight as an Indians while as one pointed out the prisoners hair curled Townsends eyebrows were heavy and black and they nearly met his face was short and fat square not long his forehead was low his mother sisters and stepfather testified to the big joints of his feet different from those of the small and rather dainty feet of the prisoner Several who had seen him daily for years told of his speaking through his nose or clenched teeth of his downcast look his feminine voice and beardless appearance Several admitted than seen at a particular angle the prisoner looked a leetle like Townsend1 but all were confident that they were not the same Mrs Dewar and her two daughters swore to Townsend having the letters W T and an anchor on his arm put on with India ink or powder and it appeared that the anchor on the wrist was part of the description sent along the line of railway when Townsend was making his escape Another witness Quick deposed that if the prisoner was Townsend he would have a scar on the left arm an inch and a half long the prisoner at the request of his counsel bared his arm and no scar anchor or letter was to be seen Mr Freeman said he did not think it necessary to address the jury the Solicitor General took the same course and the trial Judge gave a short and impartial charge telling the jury that there was really but the one question to decide Is the prisoner William Town send  After six and a half hours of consultation the jury announced their inability to agree one juryman desired the Judges opinion which was of course refused and the jury were discharged It was ascertained that the division in the jury was For conviction 7 for acquittal 4 undecided 1 The delay in finding a verdict seemed to dismay the prisoner who lost little by little his jaunty and confident air the failure to agree hit him hard he thought it was the ddest piece of business he ever came accross The trial judge remanded him to prison till the next Assizes six months later informing him however that if he could produce satisfactory evidence that he was not Townsend or could show who he really was he would be admitted to bailthe prisoner declined and spent next day writing letters During the interval many efforts were made to induce the prisoner to give some account of himself and offers were made to him to 550 WILLIAM RENWICK RIDDELLA CASE OF IDENTITY 551 collect a fund for his defense he steadfastly refused saying that he did not require money all he had to do was to prove an alibi to one he spoke of being in communication with his friends to another You do not know my family history there are things which rather than expose I would die on the gallowsthe offers of others he treated with contempt silent or avowed He did however unburden himself in part to a Scotsman from near Glasgow Walter Maitland to him he said he came from Springburn two miles from Glasgow and he gave an accurate description of the place the names of the farmers etca description which could hardly have been made up except from personal knowledge of the locality At the second trial it was attempted by the Crown to explain this knowledge by the fact that Townsends brotherinlaw John Horn was a Scotsman but he came from Dun fermline not at all near to Glasgow especially in those days and the other Scot the stepfather David Dewar came from Cupar in Fifeshire and knew nothing of Springburn Considerable interest however was taken in the case and a small fund was collected for the payment of witnesses A letter written by him at the urgent advice of a Justice of the Peace near Cayuga in June 1857 shortly after his incarceration at Cayuga began to bear fruit and the effect was manifest at the next trial This was written to Mr J Anderson Recording Scribe Sons of Temperance California and stated that the writer R McHen ery8 had been charged with a crime committed in Canada when he was residing at Chips Flats Californiathis was published in newspapers far and wide and produced a crop of witnesses for the prisoner It was determined to proceed at once against the accused for the murder of Charles Richards at Port Robinson and as the locus of this crime was in the County of Welland he was removed from Cayuga Gaol in the County of Norfolk to Merrittsville14 in the 13At the second trial this letter was produced it detailed the history of McHenry in Cleveland and California and mentioned a number of books in which McHenrys name was recorded in California Much was made by the Crown of the difference in name The prisoner signed R McHenery to the letter whereas the signature Robert J McHenry appeared on the Sons of Temperance books in California Mr McDonald the Crown counsel said during the progress of the defense he had intended to prove that there had been an R McHenry in California and that this man had taken his name and written in his name for the papers which he never would have got had he written R J McHenry But no attempt at proof of that character was made although there was much crossexamination as to other persons in Cali fornia called McHenry 14This the county town of the County of Welland is now called Welland A CASE OF IDENTITY 551552 WILLIAM RENWICK RIDDELL County of Welland At the Assizes called on the Criminal side the Court of Oyer and Terminer and General Goal Delivery5 on Octo ber 7 1857 a true bill was found against the prisoner under the name of Robert John McHenry for the murder of Charles Richards on being arraigned before Chief Justice Draper he pleaded Not Guilty and on motion of his counsel Mr Start the trial was postponed until the Spring Assizes At the Spring Assizes before Mr Justice McLean at Merritts ville on March 25 1858 the bill found at the previous Assizes was quashed on motion of the Crown Counsel and on the same day a true bill for the murder of Charles Richards was found against William Townsend otherwise called Robert

that time the trial courts were separate courts from the Court of Queens Bench and Common Pleas but were presided over by judges of these courts On the criminal side the trial courts were Courts of Oyer and Terminer and General Gaol Delivery on the civil side Courts of Assize and Nisi Prius The same judge presided in both and the courts were commonly called the Assizes the judge the Assize Judge All these technical distinc tions are fully explained by Blackstone in his commentaries they came to an end in Ontario in 1881 by the operation of the Judicature Act 44 Vic c 5 Ont 6Mr Freeman who was not only a man of high legal attainments but also of the highest character told the jury how he came to defend the prisoner on the former trial and said He asked the prisoner nothing about his history or circumstances but contented himself with hearing the evidence On that occasion he knew no more of the prisoner than what he had learned from the witnesses on the previous occasion except that he had received certain documents from California which had not been allowed to be put in as evi dence He was referring to a letter from California to the Governor General of Canada from residents of Chips Flats in California concerning McHenry which on objection by counsel for the Crown was not allowed to be put in an unexceptionable ruling 552 WILLIAM RENWICK RIDDELLA CASE OF IDENTITY 553 Both parties were better prepared for this trial having at the previous trial learned the weak points of attack and defense Very many of the witnesses on both sides swore generally without adducing reasons for their belief that the prisoner was or was not Townsend some however condescended to particulars and gave reasons The first thing to be noticed is that several witnesses for the Crown swore that Townsend had blue eyes large blue eyes one even saying light blue eyes This was opposed by an overwhelming mass of evidence that his eyes were black one schoolmate said that he was known at school as Blackeyes dark very dark dark hazel dark brown etc So nmuch was the Crown impressed with this evidence that two medical men were called who testified that persons eyes might grow lighter or darker so that it is possible for a man to have a dark blue eye one year and a light blue eye four or five years afterwards one doctor spoke of a certain child with light blue eyes when she was grown up having them dark hazel this is of course a well known phenomenon but no one swore that a dark or black eye ever grew to be a blue The hair of Townsend was said by many to have been darker than that of the prisoner but several said it was sandy and lighter one endeavoured to account for the color apparent by saying it might have been dyedmost of the defense witnesses swore to Townsends hair being black and straight as an Indians and it seems to have been taken for granted and almost admitted that the prisoners was considerably lighter than Townsends Counsel for the Crown in his address to the jury threw aside all the testimony as to the color of this mans hair and eyes One often knew nothing about the color of hair and eyes of ones friends  even now it was difficult to say whether the prisoners hair was black or brown Mr Freeman on the contrary triumphantly exclaimed to the jury Would this man the prisoner ever be called Blackeyes No doubt he was wise in dwelling upon this apparent trifle a little thing like that notoriously has an immense influence with a jury The scars came in for considerable attentionthat over the left eye seems to have much resembled one borne by Townsend as did that on the right foot But the large scar on the left cheek was the subject of much contradiction at least nine witnesses swore that Townsend had such a scar while as many swore positively he had A CASE OF IDENTITY 553554 WILLIAM RENWICK RIDDELL notthese included Townsends stepfather and some of his most intimate friendsand nearly a score had never noticed such a scar as they thought they must have done had it existed One witness for the Crown swore that the scar was caused by Townsend being kicked by a horse but he was speedily discredited the man who was in fact so kicked being called as a witness The dramatic episode of the scar on the left arm which occurred in the first trial was not repeated the witness David Quick was not called on the second trial at all17 The marking in Indian ink or powder on Townsends left arma mermaid or anchorwas again sworn to by several amongst them certain witnesses called for the Crown but its absence on the prisoner was discounted by the evidence of two who swore that they had themselves had similar Indian ink marks removed by putting breast milk on the arm over the mark and then pricking the arm in the same place againother similar cases were deposed to and no point was made of the mark by eitlier Counsel or by the Judge The defense relied strongly upon the ungainly feet of Townsend lumpy with the big toe overriding in fact big lumps which showed through a boot One witness swore if thats Bill Townsend he has got new feet on him another told of getting a pair of boots for him and wearing the new boots for two hours without discomfort while Townsend could scarcely get them on at all and could not wear them The prisoner and witness exchanged boots that of the prisoner fitted very tight on the witness and that of the witness easily slipped off and on prisoners foot still another spoke of Townsends foot having larger lumps than those of mine about the size of half an eggat the request of a juror the feet were compared and on this comparison great difference in size was at once apparent18 The fact that Townsend could never write decently and would not read anything but the lightest stuff while the prisoner spent much of his time in reading or writing was also adduced as was the want of beard in Townsend and the heavy beard of the prisoner 7No reason appears for the omission to call this witness The omission of all mention of him or his evidence raises considerable suspicion as to the reliability of his evidence on the former trial 18Dr Burns had known lumps on a mans toe joints caused by disease such as gout or by the friction of boots by the thickening of outside skin some may be removed Dr Brooks said the continued use of tight boots might enlarge the toe joints and in some cases the cause being removed the enlarge ment would disappear But such theories had probably little effect against the ocular demonstration given in court 554 WILLIAM RENWICK RIDDELLA CASE OF IDENTITY 555 It is doubtful whether all these would have secured an acquittal the defense was not much stronger than at the first trialit was the alibi evidence whicll turned the scale MAr 0 C McLouth an attornley of Sandusky Ohio testified that the prisoner had been confined tunder the name of Robert J McHenry in the Sandusky gaol from July 1851 to March 1852 on a charge of assult which utimately was not proceeded withhe then repre sented himself as an American if this evidence was true the prisoner could not be Townsend as he was employed as a cooper by Benjamin Diffin in Canada February 1852 Captain Turnbull a lake

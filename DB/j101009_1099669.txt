J101009,THE VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER,1099669,PLEADING TO AN ACTION OF ASSUMPSIT ON A SPECIALTY UNDER SEC 3246A VIRGINIA CODE ANNOTATED,I245927,766 1 0 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER JAN PLEADING TO AN ACTION OF ASSUMPSIT ON A SPECIALTY IUNDER SEC 3246A VIRGINIA CODE ANNOTATED BY W R ABBOT JR BEDFORD CITY VA BY STATUTE IS IS PROVIDED  IN ANY CASE IN WHICH AN ACTION OF COVENANT WILL LIE THERE MAY BE MAIN TAINED AN ACTION OF ASSUMPSIT 1 THUS IN ONE SENTENCE OCCUPYING LESS THAN TWO LINES OF TYPE IT IS SOUGHT TO EFFACE DISTINCTIONS OF PLEADING THAT HAVE GROWN UP WITH COMMON LAW ITSELF DISTINCTIONS WHICH ARE AMONG THE NICEST KNOWN TO THE LAW AND WHICH HAVE BEEN THE SUBJECT OF INTERPRETATION IN ALMOST COUNTLESS DECISIONS WHILE IT IS PERHAPS TRUE THAT BY THIS STATUTE THESE DISTINCTIONS HAVE BEEN EFFACED IT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED BY THROWING THE WHOLE SUBJECT INTO A CONFUSION THAT ONLY THE INGENUITY OF LAWYERS AND THE WISDOM OF THE COURTS CAN UNRAVEL AND AT AN EXPENSE TO LITIGANTS THAT IS LIKELY TO ASSUME LARGE PROPORTIONS IT IS NOT PROPOSED IN THIS ARTICLE TO DISCUSS THE EFFECT OF THE ENACT MENT IN ANY PHILOSOPHICAL MANNER OR TO SUGGEST THE FULL SCOPE OF THE CHANGE INTRODUCED BUT ONLY TO PRESENT ONE DIFFICULTY THAT HAS ALREADY ARISEN AS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT IS YET IN STORE THE ACTION OF COVENANT IS PERHAPS THE MOST TECHNICAL THAT HAS COME DOWN TO US WITH THE COMMON LAW DUE OF COURSE TO THE PAR TICULARLY TENDER ESTEEM IN WHICH THE OLD JURISCONSULTS HELD A SEALED INSTRUMENT A SIMPLE INSTRUMENT WAS TREATED WITH A FAIR DEGREE OF RESPECT AND CONSIDERATION BUT ATTACH A SEAL TO IT AND IMMEDIATELY IT BECAME INVESTED WITH A SORT OF SOLEMNITY AND SACREDNESS WHICH CAN ONLY BE EXPLAINED BY SOME SORT OF A REASON SIMILAR TO THE REASON WHY A SEAL MUST BE OF WAX SIGILLUM EST CERA IMPRESSA QUIA QUIA AS MR MINOR USED ALWAYS TO SO IMPRESSIVELY REPEAT  CERA NON IMPRESSA NON SIGILLUM EST THAT A SEAL IS WAX IMPRESSED BECAUSE WAX NOT IMPRESSED IS NOT A SEAL IS SO OBVIOUSLY THE EXPLANATION OF WHY A SEAL IS WAX IMPRESSED THAT WE LHAVE NO FEELINGS EXCEPT OF PITY AND CONTEMPT FOR THE MAN I ACTS OF 189798 P 103 AND SEC 3246A VA CODE ANNO1905 PLEADING TO AN ACTION OF ASSUMPSIT 767 WHO FIRST SUGGESTED THE QUESTION AND SO TOO NO TIME NEED BE WASTED ON AN EXPLANATION OF WHY A SEALED INSTRUMENT WAS SO HIGHLY ES TEEMED EXCEPT TO SAY THAT IT WAS BECAUSE IT WAS UNDER SEAL BUT FOR WHATEVER REASON IT IS TRUE THAT A SPECIALTY WAS INVESTED WITH CERTAIN INHERENT QUALITIES AND ATTRIBUTES THAT A SIMPLE INSTRU MENT HAD NOT OF WHICH MANY RELATED TO MATTERS OF DEFENCE UPON AN ACTION ON A SPECIALTY NO WANT OF CONSIDERATION COULD BE SET UP NO FAILURE OF CONSIDERATION NO BREACH OF WARRANTY AND THESE WERE NOT MERE RULES OF PLEADING BUT THEY WERE READ INTO EVERY CONTRACT UNDER SEAL AND BECAME A SUBSTANTIVE AND INSEPARABLE PART OF THE CONTRACT NOW IN THE ACTION OF ASSUMPSIT ON A SIMPLE CONTRACT ALL THESE DEFENCES MAY BE MADE AND UNDER THE GENERAL ISSUE OF NONAS SUMPSIT IN GIVING THE ACTION OF ASSUMPSIT ON A SPECIALTV DID THE LEGISLATURE MEAN TO ADMIT THESE DEFENCES UNDER THE GENERAL ISSUE IF IT DID NOT WHAT IS GAINED BY THE APPARENT RELAXATION IN THE RULES OF PLEADING THE WHOLE TENDENCY OF OUR MODERN LEGISLATION ON THE SUBJECT OF PLEADING IS TO THROW DOWN THE BARS AND REQUIRE ONLY A GENERAL COMPLAINT AND A GENERAL REPLY BUT NOTHING OF THE SORT IS ACCOMPLISHED IF IN THE NEW ACTION OF ASSUMPSIT ON A SPECIALTY THE DEFENCE IS CONFINED WITHIN THE OLD NARROW LIMITS THE QUESTION WAS FAIRLY PRESENTED IN A CASE RECENTLY DECIDED IN THE BEDFORD CIRCUIT COURT IT WAS AN ACTION OF ASSUMPSIT UNDER SEC 3251 OF THE CODE AS AMENDED ON A LIFE INSURANCE POLICY WHICH WAS UNDER SEAL IN THE INSUREDS APPLICATION WHICH BY REFERENCE WAS MADE A PART OF THE POLICY AND INCORPORATED INTO IT WERE CERTAIN WARRANTIES BY THE INSURED AS TO HIS PAST HABITS OF TEMPERANCE AND THE LIKE AS WELL AS PROMISSORY WARRANTIES AS TO HIS FUTURE HABITS THE DEFENCE WAS BASED ON ALLEGED MISREPRESENTATIONS AND BREACHES OF THESE WARRANTIES AND WAS PRESENTED BY THE PLEA OF NON ASSUMPSIT AND TWO SPECIAL PLEAS SETTING OUT THE MISREPRESENTATIONS AND THE WARRANTIES AND ALLEGED BREACHES BUT NOT SUPPORTED BY AFFIDAVIT THE SPECIAL PLEAS WERE NOT OBJECTED TO WHEN TENDERED BUT WHEN PROOF OF THEM WAS OFFERED THE PROOF WAS OBJECTED TO ON THE GROUND THAT THE POLICY OR CONTRACT BEING UNDER SEAL NO FAILURE OR WANT OF CONSIDERATION OR FRAUD OR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR ANY SUCH MATTER COULD BE AVAILED OF AS A DEFENCE EXCEPT BY A SPECIAL PLEA OF SETOFF VERIFIED BY AFFIDAVIT UNDER VA CODE SEC 3299768 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER JAN THE COURT HOWEVER OVERRULED THE OBJECTION HOLDING THAT ALL THESE MATTERS MIGHT BE PROVEN IN AN ACTION OF ASSUMPSIT UNDER THE GENERAL ISSUE IT WAS URGED THAT THE NEW STATUTE ESTABLISHED SIMPLY A RULE OF PROCEDURE AND HAD TO DO ONLY WITH THE FORM OF PLEADING WHILE SUCH A CONSTRUCTION AS TO ADMIT THESE DEFENCES ALTERED THE INHERENT AND SUBSTANTIVE QUALITIES OF A SEALED INSTRUMENT AND DEPRIVED IT OF THE ATTRIBUTES WITH WHICH IT WAS INVESTED THE SEAL IMPORTS FINALITY IT READS INTO THE CONTRACT AN AGREEMENT THAT THE CONSIDERATION CAN NOT BE FURTHER ENQUIRED INTO IT ELIMINATES ALL QUESTIONS OF FRAUD MISREPRESENTATION OR BREACH OF WARRANTY PERHAPS THE INSURED PAID MORE FOR THE POLICY BECAUSE OF THESE ADVANTAGES OF WHICH HE COULD NO MORE BE DEPRIVED BY THE CHANGE IN PLEADING THAN HE COULD BE DEPRIVED OF ANY ADVANTAGE OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS PERTAINING TO SPECIALTIES UNDOUBTEDLY THE DEFENCE MIGHT HAVE BEEN MADE BY A PLEA OF EQUITABLE SETOFF VERIFIED BV AFFIDAVIT UNDER SEC 3299 OF THE CODE BUT THIS WAS NOT ATTEMPTED BY OFFERING THE TWO SPECIAL PLEAS THE DEFENDANT ADMITTED THAT THE DEFENCE COULD NOT BE MADE UNDER THE GENERAL ISSUE WERE THE RULES OF PLEADING THE SAME AS IN THE ORDI NARY ACTION OF ASSUMPSIT WANT OR FAILURE OF CONSIDERATION BREACH OF WARRANTIES OR FRAUD MIGHT HAVE BEEN PROVEN UNDER THE GENERAL ISSUE AS HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY HELD2 AND THE TENDER OF THE SPECIAL PLEAS WAS AN ADMISSION THAT THE MATTER CONTAINED THEREIN WAS NOT PROVABLE UNDER THE GENERAL ISSUE ELSE IT WERE IDLE TO OFFER THEM BUT IT WOULD SEEM TO BE THE CORRECT OPINION THAT THE MATTER WAS NOT PROVABLE UNDER THE GENERAL ISSUE IN GUARANTEE COMPANY V BANK 95 VA 480 THE LOWER COURT WAS REVERSED FOR ITS FAILURE TO RECEIVE WHAT WAS CALLED PLEA NO 9 THAT WAS AN ACTION OF DEBT ON A SPECIALTY AND IN OVERRULING THE CIRCUIT COURT JUDGE RIELY SAID PLEA NO 9 PRESENTED THE DEFENCE OF FRAUD IN THE PROCUREMENT OF THE CON TRACT IT WAS NOT COMPETENT AT COMMON LAW TO SET UP THIS DEFENCE AGAINST A SEALED CONTRACT AND TO ENABLE IT TO BE DONE WAS ONE OF THE OBJECTS OF THE ACT OF 1831 NOW CONSTITUTING AS SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED SEC 3299 OF THE CODE COLUMBIA ACE ASSO V ROCKEY 93 VA 678 THE DEFENCE PRESENTED BY PLEA NO 9 WAS A VALID ONE IF PROVED IT COULD NOT BE MADE UNDER ANY PLEA THAT WAS ADMITTED AND THE COURT ERRED IN REJECTING IT 2 VIRGINIA FIRE AND MARINE V BUCK  NEWSOM 88 VA 5171905 PLEADING TO AN ACTION OF ASSUMPSIT 769 THE DEFENCE OFFERED BY PLEA NO 9 WAS THE MISREPRESENTATION BY THE BANK OF MATERIAL FACTS IN THE APPLICATION FOR THE BOND UPON WHICH THE GUARANTEE COMPANY WAS BEING SUED IN THE CASE UNDER DISCUSSION THE DEFENCE WAS THE MISREPRESENTATION BY THE INSURED OF HIS PAST HABITS AND BREACH OF PROMISSORY WARRANTIES AS TO THE FUTURE NEITHER DEFENCE COULD BE MADE AT COMMON LAW AT ALL IT IS SUB MITTED THAT NEITHER COULD BE MADE NOW WHETHER IN DEBT OR ASSUMP SIT EXCEPT FOR SEC 3299 WHICH MUST BE STRICTLY COMPLIED WITH ANY OTHER CONSTRUCTION OF THE NEW STATUTE WOULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF RENDERING SEC 3299 USELESS AND NUGATORY WITHOUT REPEALING IT FOR WHO WOULD RESORT TO A SPECIAL PLEA OF SETOFF IF THE SAME OBJECT COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED UNDER THE GENERAL ISSUE IS NOT THE EFFECT OF THE NEW STATUTE TO PUT THE ACTION OF ASSUMPSIT ON THE SAME FOOTING WITH DEBT JUST AS DEBT CAN BE BROUGHT EITHER ON A SEALED OR AN UNSEALED INSTRUMENT SO CAN ASSUMPSIT AS THE GENERAL ISSUE IN DEBT ON A SEALED INSTRUMENT IS NON EST FACTUM AN EXTREMELY NARROW PLEA SO TOO IN ASSUUMPSIT ON A SEALED INSTRUMENT UNDER THE NEW STATUTE UNLESS SPECIAL DEFENCES ARE OFFERED UNDER SEC 3299 THE PLEA SHOULD BE NON EST FACTUMN AND AS IN DEBT ON A SPECIALTY SUCH DEFENCES AS WE ARE DISCUSSING CAN ONLY BE MADE BY PLEAS OF EQUITABLE SETOFF SO IN THE ACTION OF ASSUMPSIT ON A SPECIALTY WHICH IS THE COUNTERPART OF THE ACTION OF DEBT THESE DEFENCES CAN ONLY BE MADE BY PLEA OF EQUITABLE SETOFF THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAD SOME IDEA OF DOING AWAY WITH THESE DISTINCTIONS IS POSSIBLE BUT THAT ITS LANGUAGE IS SUSCEPTIBLE OF SUCH A CONSTRUCTION IS FAR FROM CLEAR TO THE WRITER IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE THOUGH HIS JUDGMENT MAY BE IMPAIRED BY PROFESSIONAL BIAS IN ANY EVENT THE SUBJECT OFFERS A FRUITFUL FIELD FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE LEGISLATURE

j100358,The School Review,1077552,The Attitude of College Students toward Teaching,i244725,THE ATTITUDE OF COLLEGE STUDENTS TOWARD TEACHING J G LOWERY Muskingum College New Concord Ohio In view of the present shortage of teachers and the extended discussions of the teaching profession it is of interest to learn what the young people are thinking concerning this work The Department of Education of Muskingum College recently carried out an inquiry to learn just what the attitude of the student body is toward teaching as a profession The following form was used to solicit the information desired We desire to make inquiry as to the attitude of the students toward teaching as a profession A frank and thoughtful statement from those who have before them the possibility of becoming teachers this statement is desired from all whether expecting to teach or not will be a most helpful contribution to this study Please fill out the following 1 Name  School class  2 Are you preparing or expecting to prepare for teaching 3 What reasons do you give for your decision This questionnaire was put before the students at the chapel assembly without previous notice answers are therefore rather brief The inquiry provoked renewed interest in teaching judging from interviews with the department that followed These inter views revealed the fact that these young people crave an acquain tance with the main fields of modern learning such as liberal arts courses provide and that if compensation and recognition of all teachers were equal for equal training and experience teachers would more largely select the age of pupils with which they can work most successfully and take professional training accordingly Answers were received from about 75 per cent of the student body and may be summarized as follows Men Women Total Teaching as a profession  27 130 157 Will teach temporarily  23 29 52 Undecided  2 6 8 Will not teach  108 40 148 Total number reporting  160 205 365 379380 THE SCHOOL REVIEW

Some reasons in full are quoted below to illustrate the abbre viated tabulations above The numbers will serve to refer the quotations to the corresponding summaries above 1 The teaching profession offers an unlimited field of service in training the youth for the highest type of citizenship I want to do some form of social service and this is the form for which I am best prepared and in which I am most interested1920 COLLEGE STUDENTS AND TEACHING 381 It gives one not only contact with the students but with the people of the community It is a splendid chance for service along many lines A desire to do some useful work 2 I enjoy the work I think I shall like this kind of work best I enjoy school work and school life 3 I like little children and like to work with them I have a love for young people and a great interest in their develop ment of life and character It has always been my desire to work with young folks especially children 4 I have always wanted to teach because I think that is what I am best fitted for I have decided to teach because I feel that I am better fitted for that work than for any other 5 Teaching is a coming profession It is a progressive interesting profession I believe that under the present school laws there is quite an oppor tunity in administrative lines in education 6 I feel that there is a great need for teachers everywhere Because it is a profession where the ideals of the world are made it needs workers 7 I feel that I would rather teach than do anything else to make my own living I desire to do something and this seems to be the work for which I am best fitted 8 I am interested in the work I am taking up and believe there is a need for others to be interested in it 9 and 10 I feel that teaching is a profession naturally suited to girls and in most cases women are able to earn a fairly good living while rendering a noble service to humanity 11 Experience Experience and money I am expecting to go as a foreign missionary and will profit by the training and experience 12 I desire to teach biology because of the good this experience will be in the study of medicine 13 I may teach but am hoping to get into some sort of social service work I expect to do social work and may possibly teach in a settlement house 14 To earn money to complete my education 15 I do not like teaching The work does not appeal to me 16 Unremunerative Not enough money poor methods of advancement Poor returns for the preparation and service demanded Remuneration not enough to live on Teachers get 85 per month382 THE SCHOOL REVIEW coal miners get 200 and strike for more A teacher is criticized for everything he does by people who forget he is human He is the first person called upon for contributions to charity and the person least able to afford it 17 I am not fitted for the work I am not adapted to the work I think I can make better use of my time 18 I am needed at home 19 Have another line of work in view In making a study of the reasons given by young people for the selection of a life work whether it be teaching or any other calling one is impressed by the relative emphasis upon fitness for the work enjoyment of the work possibilities of service etc on the one hand as over against the money side on the other Very few give money as the chief reason for the selection or rejection of any of the callings No doubt the relative number of men and women interested in teaching will raise some comment This is partially explained by the fact that quite a few in the freshman and the sophomore classes are preparing to teach in the elementary schools More than 90 per cent of these are women Less than 25 per cent of those pre paring to teach in high school are men The percentage of men interested in teaching decreases somewhat from the senior year down to the freshman The money factor no doubt is a back ground element in this changing ratio 1 No effort was made to learn what other professions were under consideration Most all of those who are not preparing to teach expressed in one way or another that some other line of work was uppermost in their minds Most prominent among those mentioned were

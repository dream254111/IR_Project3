OFFERS AN UNLIMITED FIELD OF SERVICE IN TRAINING THE YOUTH FOR THE HIGHEST TYPE OF CITIZENSHIP I WANT TO DO SOME FORM OF SOCIAL SERVICE AND THIS IS THE FORM FOR WHICH I AM BEST PREPARED AND IN WHICH I AM MOST INTERESTED1920 COLLEGE STUDENTS AND TEACHING 381 IT GIVES ONE NOT ONLY CONTACT WITH THE STUDENTS BUT WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE COMMUNITY IT IS A SPLENDID CHANCE FOR SERVICE ALONG MANY LINES A DESIRE TO DO SOME USEFUL WORK 2 I ENJOY THE WORK I THINK I SHALL LIKE THIS KIND OF WORK BEST I ENJOY SCHOOL WORK AND SCHOOL LIFE 3 I LIKE LITTLE CHILDREN AND LIKE TO WORK WITH THEM I HAVE A LOVE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND A GREAT INTEREST IN THEIR DEVELOP MENT OF LIFE AND CHARACTER IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY DESIRE TO WORK WITH YOUNG FOLKS ESPECIALLY CHILDREN 4 I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO TEACH BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS WHAT I AM BEST FITTED FOR I HAVE DECIDED TO TEACH BECAUSE I FEEL THAT I AM BETTER FITTED FOR THAT WORK THAN FOR ANY OTHER 5 TEACHING IS A COMING PROFESSION IT IS A PROGRESSIVE INTERESTING PROFESSION I BELIEVE THAT UNDER THE PRESENT SCHOOL LAWS THERE IS QUITE AN OPPOR TUNITY IN ADMINISTRATIVE LINES IN EDUCATION 6 I FEEL THAT THERE IS A GREAT NEED FOR TEACHERS EVERYWHERE BECAUSE IT IS A PROFESSION WHERE THE IDEALS OF THE WORLD ARE MADE IT NEEDS WORKERS 7 I FEEL THAT I WOULD RATHER TEACH THAN DO ANYTHING ELSE TO MAKE MY OWN LIVING I DESIRE TO DO SOMETHING AND THIS SEEMS TO BE THE WORK FOR WHICH I AM BEST FITTED 8 I AM INTERESTED IN THE WORK I AM TAKING UP AND BELIEVE THERE IS A NEED FOR OTHERS TO BE INTERESTED IN IT 9 AND 10 I FEEL THAT TEACHING IS A PROFESSION NATURALLY SUITED TO GIRLS AND IN MOST CASES WOMEN ARE ABLE TO EARN A FAIRLY GOOD LIVING WHILE RENDERING A NOBLE SERVICE TO HUMANITY 11 EXPERIENCE EXPERIENCE AND MONEY I AM EXPECTING TO GO AS A FOREIGN MISSIONARY AND WILL PROFIT BY THE TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE 12 I DESIRE TO TEACH BIOLOGY BECAUSE OF THE GOOD THIS EXPERIENCE WILL BE IN THE STUDY OF MEDICINE 13 I MAY TEACH BUT AM HOPING TO GET INTO SOME SORT OF SOCIAL SERVICE WORK I EXPECT TO DO SOCIAL WORK AND MAY POSSIBLY TEACH IN A SETTLEMENT HOUSE 14 TO EARN MONEY TO COMPLETE MY EDUCATION 15 I DO NOT LIKE TEACHING THE WORK DOES NOT APPEAL TO ME 16 UNREMUNERATIVE NOT ENOUGH MONEY POOR METHODS OF ADVANCEMENT POOR RETURNS FOR THE PREPARATION AND SERVICE DEMANDED REMUNERATION NOT ENOUGH TO LIVE ON TEACHERS GET 85 PER MONTH382 THE SCHOOL REVIEW COAL MINERS GET 200 AND STRIKE FOR MORE A TEACHER IS CRITICIZED FOR EVERYTHING HE DOES BY PEOPLE WHO FORGET HE IS HUMAN HE IS THE FIRST PERSON CALLED UPON FOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO CHARITY AND THE PERSON LEAST ABLE TO AFFORD IT 17 I AM NOT FITTED FOR THE WORK I AM NOT ADAPTED TO THE WORK I THINK I CAN MAKE BETTER USE OF MY TIME 18 I AM NEEDED AT HOME 19 HAVE ANOTHER LINE OF WORK IN VIEW IN MAKING A STUDY OF THE REASONS GIVEN BY YOUNG PEOPLE FOR THE SELECTION OF A LIFE WORK WHETHER IT BE TEACHING OR ANY OTHER CALLING ONE IS IMPRESSED BY THE RELATIVE EMPHASIS UPON FITNESS FOR THE WORK ENJOYMENT OF THE WORK POSSIBILITIES OF SERVICE ETC ON THE ONE HAND AS OVER AGAINST THE MONEY SIDE ON THE OTHER VERY FEW GIVE MONEY AS THE CHIEF REASON FOR THE SELECTION OR REJECTION OF ANY OF THE CALLINGS NO DOUBT THE RELATIVE NUMBER OF MEN AND WOMEN INTERESTED IN TEACHING WILL RAISE SOME COMMENT THIS IS PARTIALLY EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT QUITE A FEW IN THE FRESHMAN AND THE SOPHOMORE CLASSES ARE PREPARING TO TEACH IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS MORE THAN 90 PER CENT OF THESE ARE WOMEN LESS THAN 25 PER CENT OF THOSE PRE PARING TO TEACH IN HIGH SCHOOL ARE MEN THE PERCENTAGE OF MEN INTERESTED IN TEACHING DECREASES SOMEWHAT FROM THE SENIOR YEAR DOWN TO THE FRESHMAN THE MONEY FACTOR NO DOUBT IS A BACK GROUND ELEMENT IN THIS CHANGING RATIO 1 NO EFFORT WAS MADE TO LEARN WHAT OTHER PROFESSIONS WERE UNDER CONSIDERATION MOST ALL OF THOSE WHO ARE NOT PREPARING TO TEACH EXPRESSED IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER THAT SOME OTHER LINE OF WORK WAS UPPERMOST IN THEIR MINDS MOST PROMINENT AMONG THOSE MENTIONED WERE MEDICINE MINISTRY AGRICULTURE YMCA TECHNICAL WORK ART MUSIC NURSING LAW BUSINESS

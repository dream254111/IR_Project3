J100693,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16651678,101733,A LETTER FROM LIEGE CONCERNING MR NEWTONS EXPERIMENT OF THE COLOURED SPECTRUM TOGETHER WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS AGAINST HIS THEORY OF LIGHT AND COLOURS,I206876,A LETTER FROM LIEGE CONCERNING MR NEWTONS EXPERIMENT OF THE COLOURED SPECTRUM TOGETHER WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS AGAINST HIS THEORY OF LIGHT AND COLOURS HONRD SIR MR GASCOIGNE HAVING RECEIVED YOUR OBLIGING LETTER OF JAN 18 WITH FRESH DIRECTIONS FROM MR NEWTON BUT WANTING CONVENIENCE TO MAKE THE EXPERIMENT ACCORDING TO THE SAID INSTRUCTIONS HE HAS REQUESTED ME TO SUPPLY HIS WANT IN COMPLIANCE WITH HIS REQUEST I HAVE MADE MANY TRIALS THE ISSUE WHEREOF I HERE ACQUAINT YOU WITH NEXT WITH SOME EX CEPTIONS GROUNDED ON EXPERIMENTS AGAINST MR NEWTONS NEW THEORY OF LIGHT AND COLOURS THE VERTICAL ANGLE OF MY PRISM WAS 60 DEG THE DISTANCE OF THE WALL WHEREON THE COLOURED SPECTRUM APPEARED FROM THE WIN DOW ABOUT 18 FOOT THE DIAMETER OF THE HOLE IN THE WINDOW SHUTS IN LENGTH THE LINE A WHICH UPON OCCASIONS I CON TRACTED TO HALF THE SAID DIAMETER BUT STILL WITH EQUAL SUCCESS AS TO THE MAIN OF THE EXPERIMENT THE REFRACTI ONS ON BOTH SIDES THE PRISM WERE AS NEAR AS I COULD MAKE THEM EQUAL693 EQUAL AND CONSEQUENTLY ABOUT 48 DEG 40 THE REFRACTIVE POWER OF GLASS BEING COMPUTED ACCORDING TO THE RATIO OF THE SINES 2 TO 3 THE DISTANCE OF THE PRISM FROM THE HOLE IN THE SHUTS WAS ABOUT 2 INCHES THE ROOM DARKNED TO THAT DEGREE AS TO EQUAL THE DARKEST NIGHT WHILE THE HOLE IN THE SHUTS WAS CO VERED NOW AS TO THE ISSUE OF MY TRIALS I CONSTANTLY FOUND THE LENGTH OF THE COLOURED IMAGE TRANSVERSE TO THE AXIS OF THE PRISM CONSIDERABLY GREATER THAN ITS BREADTH AS OF EN AS THE EXPERIMENT WAS MADE ON A CLEAR DAY BUT IF A BRIGHT CLOUD WERE NEAR THE SUN I FOUND IT SOMETIMES EXACTLY AS MR LINE WROTE YOU NAMELY BROADER THAN LONG ESPECIALLY WHILE THE PRISM WAS PLACED AT A GREAT DISTANCE FROM THE HOLE WHICH EXPERIMENT WILL NOT I CONCEIVE BE QUESTIONED BY MR NEW TON IT BEING SO AGREEABLE TO THE RECEIVED LAWS OF REFRACTIONS AND INDEED THE OBSERVATIONS OF THESE TWO LEARNED PERSONS AS TO THIS PARTICULAR ARE EASILY RECONCILEABLE TO EACH OTHER AND BOTH TO TRUTH MR NEWTON AS APPEARS BY HIS LETTER OF NOV LAST WHEREIN MORE FULLY HE DELIVERS HIS MIND CONTENDING ONLY FOR THE LENGTH OF THE IMAGE TRANSVERSE TO THE AXIS OF THE PRISM IN A VERY CLEAR DAY WHEREAS MR LINE ONLY MAINTAIND THE EXCESS OF BREADTH PARALLEL TO THE SAME AXIS WHILE THE SUN IS IN A BRIGHT CLOUD THOUGH AS TO WHAT IS FURTHER DELIVERED BY MR NEWTON PHIL TRANSACT N 80 P 3077 AND OPPOSED BY MR LINE N 129 P 501 NAMELY THAT THE LENGTH OF THE CO LOURED IMAGE WAS FIVE TIMES THE DIAMETER OF ITS BREADTH I NEVER YET HAVE FOUND THE EXCESS ABOVE THRICE THE DIAMETER OR AT MOST 312 WHILE THE REFRACTIONS ON BOTH SIDES THE PRISM WERE EQUAL SO MUCH AS TO THE MATTER OF FACT NOW AS TO MR NEWTONS THEORY OF LIGHT AND COLOURS I CON FESS HIS NEAT SETT OF VERY INGENIOUS AND NATURAL INFERENCES WAS TO ME UPON THE FIRST PERUSAL A STRONG CONJECTURE IN FAVOUR OF HIS NEW DOCTRINE I HAVING FORMERLY OBSERVD THE LIKE CHAIN OF INFERENCES UPON SEARCH INTO NATURAL TRUTHS BUT SINCE SEVERAL EXPERIMENTS OF REFRACTIONS REMAIN STILL UNTOUCHD BY HIM I CONCEIVED A FURTHER SEARCH INTO THEM WOULD BE VERY PROPER IN ORDER TO A FURTHER DISCOVERY OF THE TRUTH OF HIS ASSERTION FOR ACCORDINGLY AS THEY ARE FOUND EITHER AGREEING WITH OR DISAGREEING FROM HIS NEW THEORY THEY MUST NEEDS MUCH STRENG THEN694 THEN OR WHOLLY OVERTHROW THE SAME THE EXPERIMENTS I PITCH ED UPON FOR THIS PURPOSE ARE AS FOLLOW 1 HAVING FREQUENTLY OBSERVED THAT THE FORM OF OBJECTS VIEWED IN THE MICROSCOPE OR RATHER OF THE MICROSCOPE IT SELF CONSISTS ALMOST IN AN INDIVISIBLE POINT I CONCLUDED TWO VERY SMALL PIECES OF SILK THE ONE SCARLET THE OTHER VIOLET COLOUR PLACED NEAR TOGETHER SHOULD ACCORDING TO MR NEWTONS THEO RY APPEAR IN THE MICROSCOPE IN A VERY DIFFERENT DEGREE OF CLARITY IN REGARD THEIR UNEQUAL REFRANGIBILITY MUST CAUSE THE SCARLET RAYS OR SPECIES TO OVERREACH THE RETINA WHILE PLACED IN THE DUE FOCUS OF THE VIOLET ONES AND CONSEQUENTLY MUST OC CASION A SENSIBLE CONFUSION IN THE VISION OF THE FORMER ONE AND THE SAME POINT OF THE SCARLET OBJECT AFFECTING SEVERAL NERVES IN THE RETINA YET UPON FREQUENT TRIALS I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PERCEIVE ANY INEQUALITY IN THIS POINT 2 THE SECOND EXPERIMENT I MADE IN WATER I TOOK A BRASS RULER AND FASTENING THEREUNTO SEVERAL PIECES OF SILK RED YELLOW GREEN BLEW AND VIOLET I PLACED IT AT THE BOTTOM OF A SQUARE VESSEL OF WATER THEN I RETIRED FROM THE VESSEL SO FAR AS NOT TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE AFORESAID RULER AND COLOURED SILKS OTHERWISE THAN BY HELP OF THE REFRACTED RAY NOW DID MR NEWTONS DOCTRINE HOLD I CONCEIVD I SHOULD NOT SEE ALL THE MENTIONED COLOURS IN A STREIGHT LINE WITH THE RULER IN REGARD THE UNEQUAL REFRANGIBILITY OF DIFFERENT RAYS MUST NEEDS DIS PLACE SOME MORE THAN OTHERS YET IN EFFECT UPON MANY TRIALS I CONSTANTLY FOUND THEM IN AS STREIGHT A LINE AS THE BARE RULER HAD APPEARED IN 3 TO ADVANCE THIS EXPERIMENT I ADJOYNED A SECOND REFRA CTION TO THE FORMER OF THE WATER BY PLACING MY PRISM SO AS TO RECEIVE PERPENDICULARLY THE REFRACTED SPECIES OF THE SILK AND RULER WHEREBY ONLY THE EMERGENT SPECIES SUFFERED A SECOND REFRACTION BUT STILL WITH EQUAL SUCCESS AS TO THEIR APPEARING IN A STRAIGHT LINE TO THE EYE PLACED BEHIND THE PRISM 4 TO THESE TWO REFRACTIONS I FURTHER ADDED A THIRD BY RECEIVING THE COLOURED SPECIES OBLIQUELY UPON THE PRISM WHERE BY BOTH INCIDENT AND EMERGENT SPECIES SUFFERED THEIR RESPECTIVE REFRACTIONS BUT STILL WITH THE SAME SUCCESS AS FORMERLY AS TO THE STREIGHT LINE THEY APPEARED IN FOR695 FOR FURTHER ASSURANCE IN THIS EXPERIMENT  PREPOSSESSI ON OCCASIONED FROM PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE OF THE SILKS SCITUA TION IN A STREIGHT LINE MIGHT POSSIBLY PREJUDICE THE JUDGMENT OF THE EYE AS SOMETIMES I HAVE OBSERVED TO HAPPEN TO THE JUDGMENT THE EYE PASSETH UPON THE DISTANCE OF OBJECTS I CAL LED INTO THE ROOM SOME UNCONCERNED PERSONS WHOLLY IGNORANT WHAT THE EXPERIMENT AIMED AT AND DEMANDING WHETHER THEY SAW NOT THE COLOURED SILKS AND RULER IN A CROOKED LINE THEY ANSWERED IN THE NEGATIVE 5 THE NEXT EXPERIMENT I MADE IN UNCOMPOUNDED CO LOURS AS MR NEWTON TERMS THEM PROP 5  13 AS FOLLOWS HAVING CAST TWO COLOURED IMAGES UPON THE WALL SO AS THE SCARLET COLOUR OF THE ONE DID FALL IN A STREIGHT LINE PARALLEL TO THE HORIZON WITH THE VIOLET OF THE OTHER I THEN LOOKED UP ON BOTH THROUGH ANOTHER PRISM AND FOUND THEM STILL APPEAR IN A STREIGHT LINE PARALLEL TO THE HORIZON AS THEY HAD FORMERLY DONE TO THE NAKED EYE NOW ACCORDING TO MR NEWTONS AS SERTION OF DIFFERENT REFRANGIBILITY IN DIFFERENT RAYS I CON CEIVE THE VIOLET RAYS SHOULD SUFFER A GREATER REFRACTION IN THE PRISM AT THE EYE THAN THE SCARLET ONES AND CONSEQUENTLY BOTH COLOURS SHOULD NOT APPEAR IN A STREIGHT LINE PARALLEL TO THE HO RIZON 6 ANOTHER EXPERIMENT I MADE IN ORDER TO SOME FURTHER DISCOVERY OF THAT SURPRIZING PHENOMENON OF THE COLOURED IMAGE WHICH OCCASIONED MR NEWTONS INGENIOUS THEORY OF LIGHT AND COLOURS AS ALSO HIS EXCELLENT INVENTION OF THE RE FLECTING TELESCOPE AND MICROSCOPE HAVING THEN SOMETIMES SUS PECTED THAT NOT ONLY THE DIRECT SUNBEAMS BUT ALSO OTHER EX TRANEOUS LIGHT MIGHT POSSIBLY INFLUENCE THE COLOURED SPECTRUM I HOPED TO DISCOVER THE TRUTH OF THIS SUSPICION BY MEANS OF THE SUNSPOTS MADE TO APPEAR IN THE COLOURED IMAGE BY PLACING A TELESCOPE BEHIND THE PRISM BUT MY ENDEAVOURS PROVING INEFFECTUAL HEREIN BY REASON OF SOME INTERVENING DIFFICULTIES I THOUGHT AT LENGTH OF A MORE FEASIBLE METHOD IN ORDER TO THE DESIGNED DISCOVERY AS IN THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENT I FASTENED A VERY WHITE PAPERCIRCLE ABOUT AN INCH IN DIA METER UPON MY WINDOWSHUTS AND BEHOLDING IT THROUGH MY PRISM I FOUND A COLOURED IMAGE PAINTED THEREBY UPON MY RETINA ANSWERABLE IN ALMOST ALL RESPECTS TO THE FORMER OF THE Y Y Y Y SUN696 SUNBEAMS UPON THE WALL ESPECIALLY WHEN THE PAPERCIRCLE WAS INDIFFERENTLY WELL ILLUMINATED THIS IMAGE INDEED APPEAR ED CONTRARY TO THE FORMER AS TO THE SCITUATION OF COLOURS THAT IS THE SCARLET APPEARING ABOVE THE VIOLET BELOW THOUGH BUT FAINT BUT THIS I WAS NOT SURPRIZED AT HAVING OBSERVD UPON DISSECTING THE EYE THAT OBJECTS ARE PAINTED ON THE RETINA AFTER A CONTRARY POSTURE TO WHAT THEY APPEAR TO SIGHT HAVING THUS RENDRED THE COLOURED IMAGE MUCH MORE TRACTABLE THAN FOR MERLY IT WAS I CONCEIVED GOOD HOPES OF SOME FURTHER DIS COVERY IN THE POINT MENTIONED IN PURSUANCE THEN OF MY FORMER SUSPICION HAVING FIXED MY PRISM IN A STEADY POSTURE I CAUSED THE PAPER C TO BE APPLIED CLOSE UP TO THE PAPERCIRCLE A B D WHEREUPON THE FORMER VIOLET D AND SCARLET COLOUR OF G VANISHED INTO WHITENESS NEXT I REMOVED THE MENTIONED CIRCLE FROM THE SHUTS AND PLACED IT IN THE OPEN WINDOW SUPPORTED ONLY BY THE EDGE D WHEREUPON TO MY ASTONISHMENT ALL THE FORMER CO LOURS EXCHANGED POSTURES IN THE RETINA THE SCARLET NOW AP PEARING BELOW THE VIOLET ABOVE THE INTERMEDIATE COLOURS SCARCE DISCERNIBLE AND HERE ON THE BY TIS VERY REMARKABLE THAT DURING THIS OBSERVATION I CLEARLY PERCEIVED BOTH BLEW AND SCARLETLIGHT TO BE TRANSPARENT I BEING ABLE TO DISCERN SEVERAL OBJECTS THROUGH BOTH NAMELY STEEPLES OPPOSIT TO MY WINDOW WHENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT THESE COLOURS DO IN GREAT PART ARISE FROM THE NEIGHBOURING LIGHT LASTLY I PLACED THE PAPERCIRCLE ANEW SO AS THE ONE HALF B WAS FASTENED TO THE SHUTS THE OTHER SEMICIRCLE A BEING EXPOSED TO THE OPEN AIR WHEREUPON THE SEMICIRCLE A BECAME BORDERED WITH VIOLET ABOVE SCARLET BELOW BUT THE OTHER SEMICIRCLE B QUITE CON TRARV HENCE I MAKE THE FOLLOWING INFERENCES V TABII FIG 5  6 FIRST THAT NOT ONLY THE LIGHT REFLECTED FROM THE PAPERCIRCLE BUT ALSO FROM THE AMBIENT AIR HATH GREAT INFLUENCE UPON THE COLOURED IMAGE ESPECIALLY AS TO THE VIOLET AND SCARLET COLOURS WHENCE PERCHANCE IT WILL NOT HEREAFTER SEEM STRANGE THAT THE COLOURED SPECTRUM ON THE WALL IS SO LONG BUT ONLY THAT THE BREADTH IS NOT GREATER SECONDLY WERE THERE A MORE LUMINOUS BODY BEHIND THE SUN WE SHOULD IN ALL LIKELYHOOD HAVE THE CO LOURS OF THE SPECTRUM IN A CONTRARY SCITUATION TO WHAT THEY APPEAR IN AT PRESENT WHENCE THIRDLY IT SEEMS TO FOLLOW THAT THE697 THE PRESENT SCITUATION AND ORDER OF COLOURS ARISETH NOT FROM ANY INTRINSECAL PROPERTY OF REFRANGIBILITY AS MAINTAINED BY MR NEWTON BUT FROM CONTINGENT AND EXTRINSECAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF NEIGHBOURING OBJECTS FOR ACCORDINGLY AS THE BODY BE HIND THE PAPERCIRCLE WAS MORE OR LESS ILLUMINATED THAN THE CIRCLE IT SELF ALL THE SEVERAL COLOURS CHANGED THEIR SCITUA TION 8 THE NEXT EXPERIMENT WAS MADE IN ORDER TO MR NEWTONS DOCTRINE OF PRIMARY COLOURS AS PROP5 HAVING COVERED THE HOLE IN THE WINDOWSHUTS WITH A THIN SLICE OF IVORY THE TRANS MITTED LIGHT APPEARED YELLOW BUT UPON ADDING THREE FOUR AND MORE SLICES IT BECAME RED WHENCE IT SEEMS TO FOLLOW THAT YELLOWNESS OF LIGHT IS NOT A PRIMARY COLOUR BUT A COMPOUND OF REDC 9 THE LAST EXPERIMENT WAS MADE IN REFERENCE TO MR NEW TONS 12 PROPWHERE FROM HIS OWN PRINCIPLES HE RENDERS A VERY PLAUSIBLE REASON OF A SURPRIZING PHAENOMENON RELATED BY MR HOOKE NAMELY OF TWO LIQUORS THE ONE BLEW THE OTHER RED BOTH SEVERALLY TRANSPARENT YET BOTH IF PLACED TOGETHER BE CAME OPAKE THE REASON WHEREOF SAITH MR NEWTON IS BE CAUSE IF ONE LIQUOR TRANSMITTED ONLY RED THE OTHER ONLY BLEW NO RAYS COULD PASS THROUGH BOTH IN REFERENCE THEN TO THIS POINT I FILLED TWO SMALL GLASSES WITH FLAT POLISHED BOTTOMS THE ONE WITH AQUA FORTIS DEEPLY DIED BLEW THE OTHER WITH OYL OF TURPENTINE DIED RED BOTH TO THAT DEGREE AS TO REPRESENT ALL OBJECTS THROUGH THEM RESPE CTIVELY BLEW OR RED THEN PLACING THE ONE UPON THE OTHER I WAS ABLE TO DISCERN SEVERAL BODIES THROUGH BOTH WHEREAS AC CCORDING TO MR NEWTONS THEORY NO OBJECT SHOULD APPEAR THROUGH BOTH LIQUORS BECAUSE IF ONE TRANSMIT ONLY RED THE OTHER ONLY BLEW NO RAYS CAN PASS THROUGH BOTH THESE EXPERIMENTAL EXCEPTIONS WILL NOT I HOPE BE UN WELCOME TO MRNEWTON HIS ONLY AIM BEING THE IMPROVEMENT OF NATURAL KNOWLEDGEAS IT IS ALSO OF SIR YOUR BUMBLE SERVANT ANTHONY LUCAS Y Y Y Y 2 POST698 POSTSCRIPT JUST UPON THE CLOSE OF THE ADJOYNED LETTER I RECEIVED FROM MR GASCOINE YOURS OF MAY THE FOURTH WHEREIN YOU ARE PLEASED TO FAVOUR US WITH AN EXACT ACCOUNT OF THE FAMOUS EXPERIMENT OF THE COLOURED SPECTRUM LATELY EXHIBITED BEFORE THE ROYAL SOCIETY I WAS MUCH REJOYCED TO SEE THE TRIALS OF THAT ILLUSTRIOUS COMPANY AGREE SO EXACTLY WITH OURS HERE THOUGH IN SOMEWHAT OURS DISAGREE FROM MR NEWTON AS YOU WILL UNDERSTAND BY THE INCLOSED IMPAR TIAL ACCOUNT FROM SIR CFIGIV D  ANN1670 VI C

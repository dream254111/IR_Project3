J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1078499,CHICAGO INTELLIGENCE TEST IN HARRISON TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL,I244730,CHICAGO INTELLIGENCE TEST IN HARRISON TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL O WINTER HARRISON TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL CHICAGO IN SEPTEMBER 1919 WE GAVE TO THE STUDENTS ENTERING THE HARRISON TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL AS IBS THE PRELIMINARY EDITION OF THE CHICAGO INTELLIGENCE TEST DEVISED BY RUGG AND FREEMAN OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO THE NUMBER OF CORRECT RESPONSES BY EACH PUPIL WAS TAKEN AS HIS SCORE ON THE BASIS OF THESE SCORES THE PUPILS TAKING THE VARIOUS COURSES WERE GROUPED INTO SECTIONS THOSE MAKING A HIGH SCORE WERE GROUPED TOGETHER AND SO DOWN THE LIST BY SUCH A GROUPING WE HOPED TO HAVE GROUPS FOR INSTRUCTION THAT WERE MORE HOMOGENEOUS IN REGARD TO GENERAL ABILITY THAN WERE OBTAINED BY PREVIOUS METHODS OF GROUPING WE HAD FOUR SECTIONS OF TECHNICALCOURSE BOYS SO GROUPED PRESENTED HEREWITH ARE SOME OF THE RESULTS OF THAT TESTING FOR THE TECHNICAL BOYS TOGETHER WITH CORRELATIONS BETWEEN SCHOOL MARKS ABILITY TEST SCORES SCORES ON HOTZ PROBLEM AND EQUATION SCALES AND SCORES IN KELLEYS SILENT READING TEST OUR SCHOOL MARKS ARE RECORDED AS D F G E OR S D BEING FAILURE G AVERAGE AND S SUPERIOR TO OBTAIN A NUMERICAL SCORE THE FOLLOWING EQUIVALENTS WERE ASSUMED DI F2 G3 E4 AND S5 THE NUM BERS FOR THEIR FOUR MAJOR SUBJECTS WERE ADDED TO GET A COMPOSITE SCHOOL MARK FOR EACH PUPIL TABLE I SHOWS THE DISTRIBUTION OF SCORES IN THE GENERAL ABILITY TEST ALONG WITH THE COMPOSITE SCHOOL MARKS THE CORRELATION COEFFICIENT IS  30 THIS INDICATES THAT THERE IS SOME RELATIONSHIP EXISTING BUT IT IS NOT GREAT BELOW WE SHOW THE RELATIONSHIP FURTHER TABLE II SHOWS THE PERCENTAGES FOR THE VARIOUS MARKS OCCURRING IN EACH GROUP TABULATED I II III AND IV ARE THE GROUPS IN ORDER FROM BEST TO POOREST AS DETERMINED BY SCORES IN THE CHICAGO INTEL LIGENCE TEST IT MAY BE NOTED THAT THE PERCENTAGES OF FAILURES 772CHICAGO INTELLIGENCE TEST 773 DS AND THE PERCENTAGES OF FAIRS FS THE TWO LOWER MARKS INCREASE AS WE GO FROM THE BEST TO THE POOREST GROUP AND THAT THE PERCENTAGES OF THE HIGHER GRADES GS ES AND SS DECREASE AS WE GO FROM BEST TO POOREST GROUP INDEED THERE ARE NO S GRADES IN EITHER OF THE TWO LOWER GROUPS HERE AGAIN IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE TEST CLASSIFIED THE STUDENTS FAIRLY WELL ACCORDING TO THEIR ABILITY TO DO HIGHSCHOOL WORK AS MEASURED BY TEACHERS GRADES TABLE I COMPOSITE SCHOOL MARKS FREEMAN

3 IN BOTH TABLES CORRELATIONS BETWEEN THE ABILITY SCORES AND SCHOOL MARKS HAVE NO DOUBT BEEN REDUCED BECAUSE OF THE DESIRE ON THE PART OF THE AUTHORITIES IN OUR SCHOOL TO MAKE GRADES DISTRIBUTE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NORMAL PROBABILITY CURVE EACH TEACHER WAS PROBABLY LED TO JUDGE EACH CLASS TO SOME EXTENT ON ITS OWN STANDARD TO THE END THAT THE GRADES OF EACH GROUP MIGHT APPROXIMATE A NORMAL DISTRIBUTION A MARK IN A LOWER GROUP MIGHT NOT MEAN AS MUCH AS THE SAME MARK IN A HIGHER GROUP IN SPITE OF THIS THE RELATIONSHIP IS EVIDENT774 THE SCHOOL REVIEW DECEMBER IT WILL ALSO BE NOTICED THAT THE PERCENTAGES OF MARKS FOR THE WHOLE GROUP SKEW TO THE LOW END OF THE SCALE THIS IS IN AGREEMENT WITH THE EVIDENCE OF THE ABILITY SCORES IF THIS TEST DOES MEASURE GENERAL ABILITY FOR THE MEDIAN FOR THE WHOLE TECHNICAL GROUP IN THE INTELLIGENCE TEST WAS LOWER THAN THE MEDIAN FOR THE WHOLE SCHOOL THE TWO MEDIANS WERE 25 AND 275 RESPECTIVELY SEE FIG II FOR CURVES IT IS TO BE EXPECTED THEN THAT IF THE TECHNICAL GROUP IS OF LOWER ABILITY 50      THAN THE WHOLE GROUP IT WILL RECEIVE A GREATER W40  PROPORTION OF THE LOW  MARKS THIS SEEMS TO S  HAVE BEEN THE CASE 30  THE INTELLIGENCE SCORE S AS USED ABOVE CONSISTED OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF  20 L   CORRECT RESPONSES FOR THE  INDIVIDUAL AND NOT THE WEIGHTED SCORE AS REC OMMENDED BY THE AUTHORS OF THE TESTS WE LUSED THE TOTAL SCORE BE SCHOOL

I IS VERY LATER COMPUTED THE EVIDENT WEIGHTED SCORES AND FOUND THE CORRELATION WITH TOTAL RIGHTS TO BE 82 WE CON SIDERED THIS SUFFICIENTLY HIGH TO JUSTIFY OUR USING THE SIMPLER METHOD OF SCORING NAMELY THE TOTAL RIGHTS IN CLASSIFYING OUR ENTERING CLASS OF FEBRUARY 1920 WE HAVE SCORES FOR THIS GROUP IN I THE CHICAGO INTELLIGENCE TEST TOTAL RIGHTS 2 THE CHICAGO INTELLIGENCE TEST WEIGHTED SCORES

WITH THE OTHER TESTS ALSO WE NOTE THAT THE UNIFORM TESTS THE KANSAS SILENT READING TEST AND THE HOTZ PROBLEM AND EQUATION SCALES HAVE HIGHER CORRELATION WITH THE INTELLIGENCE SCORES THAN DO COMPOSITE SCHOOL MARKS THIS POINTS OUT DEFINITELY THE TENDENCY OF THE TEACHERS TO GRADE EACH GROUP ON ITS OWN STANDARD AND INDICATES THAT THE VARIOUS LETTERS D F G E S HAVE DIFFERENT MEANINGS IN THE DIFFERENT GROUPS THE EVIDENCE APPEARS TO JUSTIFY THE CONCLUSION THAT THE CHICAGO INTELLIGENCE TEST DOES CLASSIFY STUDENTS FAIRLY WELL ACCORDING TO THEIR ABILITY TO SUCCEED IN THE HIGH SCHOOL

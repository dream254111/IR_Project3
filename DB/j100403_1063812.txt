damages recovered or have his judgment reversed28 THE RIGHT OF A COMMON CARRIER TO LIMIT ITS LIABILITY The question as to the right of a common carrier to limit its lia bility in interstate shipments for loss or damage to merchandise and baggage has given rise to two distinct lines of decisions One holds that this liability may be limited by a reasonable contract with the shipper based upon the value of the thing carriedl while the other holds that any such contract is invalid on grounds of public policy2 In 1906 Congress in order to remedy this lack of uniformity in the law passed the Hepburn Amendment to the In terstate Commerce Act3 Since the passage of this amendment two important questions have arisen as to the interpretation of section 20 of the same known as the Carmack Amendment4 The first is as to the meaning of the last three lines of this section Pro vided that nothing in this section shall deprive any holder of such receipt or bill of lading of any remedy or right of action which he has under the existing law Does this continue in force the com mon law and the local State laws on the subject In a Nebraska case 5 it was held that the shippers right according to the local State law to recover the full amount of his loss from the carrier legardless of a stipulation which limits the carriers liability is not affected by the Carmack Amendment And the same was held in an Iowa case6 In 1912 the question came before the United States Supreme Court and it overruled the decisions in the two cases supra holding that the Carmack Amendment gives

merchandise and baggage is as follows That any common carrier railroad or transportation company re ceiving property for transportation from a point in one state to a point in another state shall issue a receipt or bill of lading therefor and shall be liable to the lawful holder thereof for any loss damage or injury to such property caused by it    and no contract receipt rule or regulation shall exempt such common carrier railroad or transpor tation company from the liability here imposed Provided that noth ing in this section shall deprive any holder of such receipt or bill of lading of any remedy or right of action which he has under the existing law 5 Latter v Chicago Ry Co 97 C C A 198 172 Fed 850 Betus v Chicago Ry Co 150 Ia 252 129 N W 962 405 NOTESVIRGINIA LAW REVIEW exclusive control over the subject and that it supersedes all reg ulations and policies of particular States7 The next question arising under this amendment is as to the in terpretation of that section of it reading and no contract receipt rule or regulation shall exempt such common carrier railroad or transportation company from the liability here imposed Does this forbid the carrier to enter under all circumstances into con tracts limiting its liability The United States Supreme Court has answered that a limitation of liability based upon an agreed value to obtain a lower rate has no tendency to exempt from liability and a provision in a bill of lading or a receipt to such effect does not violate the Carmack Amendment8 The determination of these two questions by the Supreme Court seems to have settled all disputes as to the right of a common car rier to limit its liabilityit can do so if the same be based upon at agreed value and no State can deprive it of this right But only in the last few months another question has arisen Do these deci sions of the Supreme Court apply to baggage cases wherein the passenger does not know that the charge made is based on the value of the baggage in other words where there is no agreement be tween the parties as to valuation This point has arisen in the two recent cases of Ford v Chicago etc Ry Co Minn 143 N W 249 and Barstow v New York etc Ry Co N Y 143 N Y Supp 983 In both the limitation as to baggage was clearly stated on the baggage receipt and on the passengers ticket was posted on the station walls and filed with the InterState Commerce Com mission The passenger however was ignorant of the same and his attention was not called to it Both courts held that the cases were directly in point with the Supreme Court cases and that there fore since the Supreme Court had spoken they must follow its de cision In so deciding it seems that they failed to note the distinc tion between the merchandise cases before the Supreme Court and the baggage cases before them In one of the former the consignor himself testified that he knew that if the value had been declared the express rate would have been higher and that for that reason he said nothing9 In another the consignor made the valuation him self by signing the bill of lading which read and the said shipper represents and agrees that his said live stock do not exceed in value 7 Adams Express Co v Croninger 226 U S 491 33 Sup Ct 148 See also cases cited infra footnote 8 8 Adams Express Co v Croninger supra Wells Fargo  Co v NeimanMarcus Co 227 U S 469 33 Sup Ct 267 Kansas City South ern Ry Co v Carl 227 U S 639 33 Sup Ct 391 Missouri etc Ry Co v Harriman Bros 227 U S 657 33 Sup Ct 397 See also 13 I C C Rep 550 where the InterState Commerce Commission ruled that the stipulation is valid even when the loss is due to the carriers neg ligence if the shipper has himself declared the value expressly or by implication the carrier accepting the same in good faith as the real value and the rate of freight being fixed in accordance therewith 9 Wells Fargo  Co v NeimanMarcus Co supra 406those prices referring to the schedule set out immediately before that declaration0 And in the other two the shipper must have known of the contract of limitation clearly set out in the bill of lad ingl1 As was stated by the court the liability may be limited or qualified by special contract with the shipper and the ground upon which the shipper is limited to the valuation is that of estop pel 12 In the baggage cases however the shipper knew nothing of the limitation placed upon the value of the baggage and the mere receipt of the baggage check and ticket containing an arbitrary state ment as to the amount of the carriers liability does not amount to a contract between the parties nor does it give rise to an estoppell3 There is then a distinction between these two sets of cases and the courts of New York and Minnesota would seem to have overlooked it in holding that the recent decisions before the Supreme Court ap plied to the cases before them In the former there was an agree ment between the parties as to the extent of the limitation in the latter there was no agreement at all What the Supreme Court will do with such cases when they come before it is not known but the better view as supported by the weight of authority is that in the absence of an agreement between the carrier and passenger as to a limitation of liability based upon value or a representation by the passenger as to the value of his baggage or a knowledge on his part that the price of a ticket is based upon the value of the baggage carried the carrier is liable for the actual value if the baggage is lost by its negligence or fault14 0 Missouri etc Ry Co v

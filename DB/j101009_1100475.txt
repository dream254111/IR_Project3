that the effect of the decision of the Court of Appeals of Virginia in the Fallsburg Manucfacturing Company v Alexander was to hold that the pro visions of chapter 61 Code 1887 commonly known as The Mill Acts could constitutionally be made to apply to grist mills only and not to industrial corporations I cannot think this conclusion is justified by either the issues raised or the opinion delivered in that case and in view of the magnitude of the question in its effect on investments already made and desired to be made in Virginia I am led to ask for space to present for what they are worth my views on this important subject The Mill Acts are statutes enacted by the several states intended to facilitate and encourage the construction of mills and manu factories Under these acts the owner of a mill site is allowed to erect a mill on his own land and if he owns but one bank of the stream or has to back water on the lands of any other proprietor he is allowed to apply to the courts for leave to erect his mill on which application the court can devote to his use a limited quantity of the lands of the other proprietor necessary for a dam or race and can ascertain the prospective damages resulting from such overflow which he is allowed to pay in solido But the action of the court is controlled by a just legal discretion exercised with a due regard to the rights of others The Virginia act on this subject is found in chap 61 sections 13471360 Code of 1887 This act was certainly not directly involved in the case under consideration The Fallsburg Company an industrial corporation was granted in its charter the right to emineilt domain and also authorized to proceed under chapter 46 of the Code in the manner 19 Virginia Law Register 123 42 S E 194266 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Aug prescribed for internal improvement or quasi public corpora tions It proceeded under sections 10751079 of chapter 46 a chapter conferring the right of eminent domain on internal im provement companies and the court held that the right of eminent domain can not be delegated by the state to an industrial corpora tion which is not compellable to devote its business to a public use but is allowed at its discretion to devote any part or all of its busi ness exclusively to private uses and accordingly dismissed the pro ceedings In the main the powers conferred by the Mill Acts are essentially different from those given by internal improvement companies originating in different principles of law and exercised under dif ferent agencies Before distinguishing the two acts it may be use ful to consider for a while the origin and development of the Mill Acts generally and in Virginia especially A very interesting resume of the history of the general Mill Acts is found in the opinion of MIr Justice Gray in case of Head v Amoskeag Mfg C02 A reference to the statutes of various states is found in a note to that case I make the following quotation from MLr Justice Grays opinion General Mill Acts exist in a great majority of the States of the Union Such acts authorizing land to be taken or flowed in invitum for the erection and maintenance of mills existed in Virginia Maryland Delaware and North Carolina as well as in Massachusetts New Hampshire and Rhode Island before the Declaration of Independence and exist at this day in each of these States except Maryland where they were repealed in 1832 One passed in North Carolina in 1777 has remained upon the statutebook of Tennessee They were enacted in Maine Kentucky Missouri and Arkansas soon after their admission into the Union They were passed in Indiana Illinois Michigan Wisconsin Iowa Nebraska Minnesota Mississippi Alabama and Florida while they were yet territories and reenacted after they became States They were also enacted in Pennsylvania in 1803 in Connecticut in 1864 and more recently in Vermont Kansas Oregon WVest Virginia and Georgia but were afterwards repealed in Georgia  As is said by the learned justice the principle object of the earlier acts was encouraging the erection of grist mills but as the development of industries demonstrated the necessity for a greater number and variety of mechanical instrumentalities the statutes were enlarged so as to comprehend manufacturing industries as well as grist mills It cannot be denied however that there has 2 113 U S 91903 THE MILL ACTS 267 been a great contrariety of opinion among the different courts of the Union with regard to the constitutionality of such statutes In Vermont and Georgia such acts have been held unconstitu tional because grist mills were declared to be private not public agencies and the right to use the water on anothers land or to use anothers land for a grist mill was the taking of private property for private purposes Tyler v Beecher3 Loughbridge v Harris4 The state of Tennessee held that a grist mill was a public use and that hence such statutes were valid in so far as they relate to grist mills but that a saw mill or a paper mill was a private in stitution and the statute could not be applied to the construction of the latter class of mills Harding v Goodlet5 Alabama seems to concur with Tennessee in this view See Bottoms v Brewer6 Sadler v Lanrgham7 The validity of such statutes as applied to industrial plants has been sustained in Massachusetts Connecticut New Hampshire Maine Iowa Kansas Minnesota Wisconsin and some other states A list of some of these cases will be found in a note to Turner v Nye8 In Boston Mills Co v Newman9 Judge Putnam in discussing whether or not a manufacturing enterprise was a public use uses the following language And in regard to the manufticturing establishments is it nothing to the public that great numbers of citizens have the means of employment brought to their homes And are not the proprietors obliged to give employment They cannot carry their works on without labor and who that is disposed to industry and to that kind of employment is prevented from its exercise This becomes a matter of interest which will certainly direct and govern the parties And it is among the most pleasant considerations attending this branch of the subject that the interest or benefit arising from manufacturing establishments is distributed quite as much and oftentimes more among the laborers and operatives than among the proprietors of the works In Hazen v Essex Co10 Shaw Chief Justice on page 477 says The establishment of a great millpower for manufacturing purposes as an object of great public interest especially since manufacturing has come to be one of the great public industrial pursuits of the commonwealth seems to have been regarded by the legislature and sanctioned by the jurisprudence of the common 344 Vermont 648 8 Am

what is a public use justifying the exercise of the right of eminent domain See also Lowell v Bosto7r1 Turner v Nye12 Olmstead v Camp13 was a proceeding to raise a dam used in con nection with a grist mill but the court there discusses the general doctrine as applicable to manufacturing enterprises giving the fol lowing definition of a public use  Public use may therefore well mean public usefulness utility or advantage of what is productive of general benefit so that any appropriating of private property by the State under its right of eminent domain for purposes of great advantage to the community is a taking for public use Such it is believed is the construction which has uniformly been put upon the language by the courts legislatures and legal authorities And on page 228 the learned judge says  If there be any doubt on the subject on first principles we understand it to be the settled law of the country that the flowing of land for the purposes of mills and manufactories in view of its effect upon the community is to be con sidered as a taking it for public use It would be difficult to conceive a greater public benefit than garnering up the waste waters of innumerable streams and rivers and ponds and lakes and compelling them with a gigantic energy to turn machinery and drive mills and thereby build up cities and villages and extend the business the wealth the population and the prosperity of the State The Supreme Court of New Jersey in Scutter v TrentonDela ware Falls Co14 upheld the validity of the charter of the Trenton Delaware Falls Co and established its right to flood with its dam adjoining proprietors on the ground that the water power to be created would be sufficient for the erection of seventy mills and factories as well as other works dependent upon such power In Retall v Bryan5 that state recognized the right to flood Maryland lands for the purpose of furnishing water to the city of Washingtona use the benefit of which was received by people not residents of the state of Marvland But the devotion of property to a public use is not the only ground on which the validity of the Mill Acts has been sustained In the case of Head v Amosikeag Mfg Co supra Mr Justice Gray declined to rest his opinion on that ground saying  The question whether the erection and maintenance of mills for manufactur ing purposes under a general Mill Act of which any owner of land upon a 1111 Mass 464 1214 L R A 487 13 33 Conn 532 89 Am Dec 221 141 Saxons Chancery 694 23 Am Dec 756 1514 Md 444 74 Am Dec 5501903 THE MILL ACTS 269 stream not navigable may avail himself at will can be upheld as a taking by delegation of the right of eminent domain of private property for public use in the constitutional sense is so important and far reaching that it does not become this court to express an opinion upon it when not required for the determination of the rights of the parties before it We prefer to rest the decision of this case upon the ground that such a statute considered as regulating the manner in which the rights of proprietors of lands adjacent to a stream may be asserted and enjoyed with a due regard to the interest of all and to the public good is within the con stitutional power of the legislature  When property in which several persons nave a common interest cannot be fully and beneficially enjoyed in its existing conditions the law often provides a way in which they may compel one another to submit to measures necessary to secure its beneficial enjoyment making equitable compensation to any whose con trol of or interest in the property is thereby modified The right of the owner of a mill seat to flood the land of his neighbor above him is likened to the right of one coparcener to have the interest of another coparcener sold the right of one joint tenant to have the interest of his cotenant repaired or restored the right of adjoining proprietors to compel contribution for the cost of draining their several meadows and the right of a majority of the joint owners of a ship to control its employment It is said by the learned judge that The right to the use of running water is publici juri8 and common to all the proprietors of the bed and banks of the stream from its source to its outlet Each has a right to the reasonable use of the water as it flows past his land not inter fering with a like reasonable use by those above or below him One reasonable use of the water is the use of the power inherent in the fall of the stream and the force of the current to drive mills That power cannot be used without damming up the water and thereby causing it to flow back If the water thus dammed up by one ripaxian proprietor spread over the lands of others they could at common law bring successive actions against him for the injury so done them or even have the dam abated Before the Mill Acts therefore it was often im possible for a riparian proprietor to use the water power at all without the con sent of those above him The purpose of these statutes is to enable any riparian proprietor to erect a mill and use the water power of the stream provided he does not interfere with an earlier exercise by another of a like right or with any right of the public and to substitute for the common law remedies of repeated actions for damages and prostration of the dam a new form of remedy by which anyone whose land is flowed can have assessed once for all either in a gross sum or by way of annual damages adequate compensation for the injury In Fiske v Framingham Mfg Co6 Shaw C J rested the val idity of the acts both upon the public use and the right of the 1629 Mass 67270 9 VIRGIINIA LAW REGISTER Aug owner of the mill site to utilize his own property On page 70 he said  One may have a sufficient millsite on his own land with ample space on his own land for a millpond or reservoir but yet from the operation of the well known physical law that fluids will seek and find a level he cannot use his own property without flowing the water back more or less on the lands of some other proprietor We think the power given by statute was intended to apply to such cases and that the legislature meant to provide that as the public interest in such case coincides with that of the millowner and as the millowner and owner of lands to be flowed cannot both enjoy their full rights without some interference the latter shall yield to the former so far that the former may keep up his mill and head of water notwithstanding the damage done to the latter upon payment of an equitable compensation for the real damage sustained to be ascertained in the mode provided by statute This idea is later amplified by the same Chief Justice in Williams v Nelson17 where it is said The statute still regards the flowing of ones lands by the milldam of an other as a grievance and cause of damage but on considerations of equity and public policy it changes the mode of redress by allowing the recovery of a gross sum as a compensation for the perpetual easement or an allowance of annual damages The statute strictly speaking does not confer on the millowner the right to flow the land of another it conveys no interest in the nature of a lease hold or easement or otherwise or any authority to make any actual use of the others land as a pond or reservoir The owner may still embank against the water if he pleases and thus preserve his own land from being flowed But the extent of the power conferred on the millowner by the statute is to erect and maintain the dam on his own land and keep up his head of water to his own best advantage notwithstanding it may flow back on the land of others And a mode of ascertaining and securing payment of the damages is provided To the same effect is Murdock v Sticklney8 and the doctrine finds more or less distinct expression in Lowell v Boston9 U S v A Mes20 Wadely v Johnson21 Jones v Skinner22 Olmstead v Camp23 We have found no case in which this doctrine has been considered and rejected Passing now to Virginia the first expression of the legislatures will on this subject which I have been able to discover is in the 4th act of the laws of 1667 19th year of Charles II which on account of its antiquity and brevity it may be admissible to quote Whereas it would conduce much to the convenience oi this country both for the grinding of corne and of neere roads if mills were erected at convenient 17 40 Mass 143 18 62 Mass 116 19111 Mass 464 466 201 Woodb  M 76 88 215 Iredell 22 61 Me 25 28 2833 Conn 89 Am Dec 2211903 THE MILL ACTS 271 places which diverse persons would willingly doe if not obstructed by the per verseness of some persons not permitting others though not willing themselves to promote soe publique a good it is enacted by this grand assembly that if any person willing to erect one or more mills upon convenient places hath land only on one side the said place and the owners of the land on the other side shall refuse to let him have an acre of his land to the end aforesaid that then the county court upon request of the party soe refused shall order and impower two of their com missioners or such other credible persons as they shall think fitt to view the said land and if it take not away howsing orchards or other immediate conveniencies then to value the said quantity of land and to put the same into the possemion of the party building the said mill or mills he paying the consideration the land is valued at And it isfurther enacted that the like liberty shall be granted for two acres of land and noe more for erecting churches or courthouses Provided that in case of desertion of any such structure the land shall revert to the first pro prietor he paying what he received for it 2 Hennings Stat at Large page 260 Certain amendments unimportant as to the subject under dis cussion are found in 3 Hennings Stat at Large page 401 4th iennings Stat at Large page 859 6th Hennings Stat at Large page 55 These statutes if not in terms by inevitable construction were limited in their operation to grist mills The first amendment germane to the question under considera tion is found in the Code of 1819 vol 2 chap 235 though its en actment was prior thereto The revisors of the Code amplified the act so as to adapt it to changed and developed conditions and the extended need of the people It was made to include not only grist mills but also any other machine or engine useful to the public But the rights of the applicant were very carefully guarded The power to take or even to trespass on his neighbors land was rot given to the applicant The exercise of this power was confided in the court which if certain conditions were met might grant the leave applied for provided after weighing all the circumstances it be reasonable that such leave be given No land could be taken or granted for the mill The applicant must himself be the mill owner and what leave was granted to him was to develop the use of his own property A very limited quan tity of land could be taken for any purpose and what was taken upon a nonuser reverted to the original owner But the leave or right of flowage was the main object of this statute There the applicant acquired no rights He had the anticipated damages for his anticipated trespass ascertained and when ascertained and paid he had leave to commit the continuing trespass but in the flowed272 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Aug land he acquired no title nor right and for all damages not antici pated he was still liable Except for some modifications in the machinery of this statute it remains practically the same today it was when incorporated in the Code of 1819 See Code of 1849 vol 1 chap 63 page 328 Code 1860 chap 63 page 368 Code 1873 chap 63 page 608 Code 1887 chap 61 sec 1347 It is evident that in the opinion of the eminent jurists who have codified the laws of Virginia from 1819 to 1887 there was in these mill acts no granting of the power of eminent domain inconsistent with the limitations of the constitution Whether they justified the act like Mr Justice Gray on the ground that it was enabling the mill owner to develop the usefulness of his own property at his own costs and hence as appurtenant to his ownership of property or like Chief Justice Shaw on that ground and also on the ground of a public use the writer is unable to say Indeed it is possible that no doubts as to the validity of the acts were ever entertained by them and no reason for justification was deemed necessary Cer tain it is that in the numerous cases in which the validity and correctness of the judgment of courts establishing such mills were involved no question of the unconstitutionality of the act was enter tained or discussed It is true that prior to the Code of 1819 all applications for leave to flood lands which came under the consideration of the Court of Appeals of Virginia were for grist mills but it appears that very soon after the amendment referred to was made an appli cation was filed for a manufacturing mill grist mill and saw mill When this application was presented does not appear but its regu larity was involved in Stokes and Smith v The Up2per Appomattox Co24 decided in 1831 The court there was divided as to whether or not the applicant had complied with the statute and the order of the court but the validity of the statute and the power of the court to grant the leave desired for a manufacturing mill seems not to have been questioned It will hardly be questioned that a planing mill is anv less a public use than a saw mill or that there is any difference in prin ciple between the machinery that saws the tree the machinery that polishes the wood and the machinery that sends out the finished 243 Leigh 318 top p 3471903 THE MILL ACTS 273 product Hines v Shugart25 Hunter v Matthews26 Mairs v Gal lahue27 In Hunter v Matthews28 the applications were for saw mills and grist mills and no question as to the right to make such application was raised by the parties or the court The application in Pitzer v Willitams29 was for leave to erect a carding machine and the proceedings were had under Code 1819 without controversy as to the construction or validity of the statute in this regard It is true that since 1819 most of the applications which have been made in Virginia were for grist mills but con sidering the relative demand in this state for water power for grist mills and for other manufactories it is not surprising that the grist mill predominates It is also true however that though the applications for other mills have been few none has been refused by the court on the ground that it was an undue exercise of the power of eminent domain Considering the Mill Acts in the light cast upon them by the de cisions above quoted I think I was justified in saying in the open ing of this article that the powers conferred thereby are essentially different from those given to internal improvement companies and hence in no sense involved in the case of Fallsburg Co v Alex ander The power of eminent domain is delegated directly to the internal improvement company Its hand is the hand of the state It decides whether or not it will take the land of the citizen and within certain limitations what and how much land it will take And within those limitations its discretion and power are absolute The courts may supervise this exercise of the delegated power They must see that it is exercised in accordance with the limita tions of the statute and that the compensation is ascertained and paid but upon the question of the exercise of the power of taking private property the courts have no voice The hand of the internal improvement company is the hand of the state The applicant under the Mill Acts has no such power To him no rights are granted He is a petitioner to the court and in so far as the power of eminent domain is exercised at all it is exercised by the state through the court and not by the applicant On the question of the exercise of that power he has no voicethe hand of 25 10 Leigh 343 26 12 Leigh 228 27 9 Gratt 994 281 Rob 494 29 2 Rob 252274 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Aug the court is the hand of the state and by its discretion is the exer cise of the power of eminent domain determined Again The power of eminent domain is granted to internal improvement companies not as appurtenant or necessary to the use of any property owned by the company It is usually granted be fore the company has any property and is intended to enable the company not only to acquire the substantive real property but all the property necessary for the inauguration establishment and conduct of its business But under the Mill Acts the applicant must himself own the substantive property which is to be developed and utilized and the court can only allow him as appurtenant thereto to take or damage so much as may be necessary for such use It is evident to the most casual student of the subject that the quantity of land which may be taken by the applicant under the Mill Acts is generally but an insignificant proportion of the prop erty that is used in the enterpriseone acre for mill dam purposes and a strip not exceeding 100 feet in width for canal purposes In the lands which are overflowed the applicant acquires no interest or title30 He has not even the right to overflow because the owner may interpose barriers to keep the water off his land He has simply acquired the right to erect the dam on his own land and to immunity for the damages to such land then ascertained For damages not contemplated he has no immunity31 And upon a new application for a mill the applicant will have no rights on account of the former payment of damages The damages must be ascer tained and paid for anew He has simply paid in advance in solido the damages accruing to the property of others from a use made of his own property under the direction and control of the court From a consideration of the authorities cited and the Virginia statute I think I am warranted in the following conclusions First That the question as to whether or not an industrial enterprise is a public use is one about which there is the greatest contrariety of opinion but that the weight of authority and the reason of the law would seem to sustain the view that large malnu facturing enterprises which give employment and furnish liveli hood to a great number of people in any community and build up 30 Hunter v Matthews 1 Rob 468 31 C  0 R R Co v Chambers 95 Va 5031903 THE MILL ACTS 275 cities and towns are as much public uses as are the grist mills which originally invoked the exercise of the powers granted under the Mill Acts and that the necessities of modern commerce as well as the present demand for employment in communities and locali ties demonstrate the public necessity for such enterprise If they are of public necessity they are of public utility I cannot but believe that the building of a cotton mill or manu facturing plant or the furnishing of power to such enterprises confers as much benefit upon the public as the grinding of grain in the ordinary grist mill Without the grist mill the grain cannot be ground but without the manufacturing enterprise there will be no means of buying the grain for the grinding It may be asked If we recognize this line of public demand where will we stop The question is not where will we stop but how far have we gone In recognizing that a grist mill is a public use have we not already gone as far as we go in recognizing that a factory is a public use We are not changing the law nor the limitations thereof We are not enlarging the definition or cri terion of a public use The criterion of a public use remains the same But those industries which before the vast development of modern industrial enterprises were mere private institutions have now become controlling factors in the business of communities and necessary means of support for its people and by that fact have moved up to the standard of a public use A luxury of one age may be a necessity of another It may be said that the legislature had the power to control grist mills And so it will have the power to control all sudh manufac turing enterprises Those corporations which exercise the power of eminent domain submit themselves to the same control as is exer cised by the legislature over public corporations The Fallsburg Manufacturing Company v Alexander supra It is true the grant of power of eminient domain does not change the corporation from a private to a public corporation but the resultant power of control by the legislature removes any distinction between a grist mill and a manufacturing plant And does not the legislature in regulating the ages of employees the hours of labor and the medium of payment of wages exercise as much control over manufacturing plants as it has ever exercised over ordinary grist mills276 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Aug Second Though a manufacturing plant be not a public use yet the owner of a site for such plant will not be deterred from devel oping it because such development results in damages to the property of others but he will be allowed to utilize and enjoy his own property to the fullest extent by paying to others the resultant damages to be ascertained by the state As was said by Shaw C J in Fiske v Framingham Mfg Co supra As the public interest in such cases coincides with that of the mill owner and as the mill owner and owner of lands to be flowed cannot both enjoy their full rights without some interference the latter shall yield to the former so far that the former may keep up his mill and head of water notwithstanding the damage done to the latter upon payment of an equitable compensation for the real damage sustained to be ascertained in the mode provided by statute The recognition of this right and its practical application to the necessities of commerce have been powerful instrumentalities in inaugurating and developing the New England manufactories and in enabling her astute and enterprising people to wrest from Eng land the supremacy of the industrial world Some think that this supremacy is moving southward and that the many advantages of our Southland must inevitably have their influence on the tide of commercial enterprise Already the growth of factories in the South demonstrates not only her natural advantages but the energies and capabilities of her people The writer once heard one of the most astute and conservative cotton manufacturers of a neighboring state say in substance that the problem of competition in cotton manufacture between the Northern and Southern manufacturer had becomea solved problem Through the advantages of climate the hours of labor and the wages of employees the Southern factory can undersell the North ern factory The difficult problem will come when one Southern factory has to undersell another Then the factory that runs by water power will be the survivor The water shed which divides the Ohio and the Mississippi from the Atlantic furnishes water power beyond the possibility of com mercial demand It is to be hoped that its development can never be retarded by individual caprice but that it will be regulated by a wholesome and conservative recognition of the rights of property owners and the necessities of the public1903 THE MILL ACTS 277 Third The case of Fallsburg Manufacturing Company v Alex ander does not construe the MKill Acts nor pass upon their validity Nor does it hold that a manufacturing plant is per se not a public use On the contrary the court in that case recognized that what constitutes a public use depends to no little extent upon the changing demands of a public necessity The limitations of this recognition were most happily reserved to the court for future con sideration in the following language of Judge Cardwell  We do not mean to say however that under no condition can the right of eminent domain be conferred by the legislature in furtherance of the establish ment of plants for the generation of electric power or other power light or heat where public necessity requires it and the public use or benefit is apparent and safely guarded To meet industrial progress new conditions and the everin creasing necessities of society the courts have gone very far in sustaining legisla tion conferring the franchise of eminent domain and it is not necessary for us in this case if we were so inclined to question the soundness of thre policy sustained in those decisions ABRAM P STAPLES Roanoke Va

Pa 328 Millikin v Shafleigh 36 Mo 596 88 Am Dec 171 Miller v Bank 30 Md 392 note 32 L R A 721 It would seem however that when the owner of the paper has indorsed it in blank and so prima facie transferred the ownership thereof the better rea soning is with the view taken by the Illinois and United States courts Of course as in the present case this view will sometimes work great hardship but the owner of such paper always has it in his power by means of a restrictive indorsement to protect himself in his ownership CONFLICT OF LAWSMARRIED WOMENNOTE MADE IN ONE STATE BUT PAYABLE IN ANOTHERDefendant a married woman residing in Tennessee signed with her husband and another in Tennessee a note to the plaintiff a bank located in Ohio payable at its banking house The note so executed was sent by mail from Tennessee to the Ohio bank to renew another note executed under like circumstances A married woman in Ohio could bind herself by such a contract but such a contract was voidable if executed by a married woman in Tennessee In an action brought by the holder in the Tennessee courts Held that no recovery could be had against this defend ant First National Bank of Geneva v Shaw 1902Tenn 70 S W Rep 807 The court held that the note was to be regarded as an Ohio contract citing Armstrongv Best 112 N C 59 17 S E 14 25 L R A 188 34 Am St Rep 473 Milliken v Pratt 125 Mass 374 28 Am Rep 241 Hall v Cordell 142 U S 116 12 Sup Ct Rep 154 35 L ed 956 Hubble v Im provement Co 95 Tenn 585 32 S W 956 It held further however that the courts of Tennessee would not enforce against a resident of Tennessee a contract which would not be enforceable if made and delivered in that state citing some portions of Milliken v Pratt supra Bank v Walker 14 Lea Tenn 299 Pearl v Hansborough 9 Humph Tenn 426 In Milliken v Pratt supra the action was sustained though in that case it appeared that the law of the forum had been changed since the contract was made and before the action was brought so that the liability was consistent with the present policy of the state The court of errors and appeals of New Jersey has also sustained the action against a New Jersey defendant in Thompson v 7aylor66 N J L 253 49 Atl 544 54 L R A 585 To like effect is Phoenix Ins Co v Simons 52 Mo App 357 Notwithstanding these cases however the true view seems to be that of the Tennessee court i e that the comity of states does not require or sanction the enforcement by the courts of the domicile of contracts authorized by the laws of another state but opposed to the settled policy of the state of domicile CONFLICT OF LAWSMARRIED WOMANNOTE MADE IN ONE STATE PAYABLE IN ANOTHER AND ACTION BROUGHT IN THE THIRDAction was brought upon a promissory note made in Alabama by the defendants Chap man Reynolds  Company a copartnership Elizabeth J Chapman was the wife of W P Chapman who was a member of the firm She signed the note in question which was made payable at the Union National Bank Chicago Ill at the request of her husband as surety for the firm and while it was the intention of the firm that the note should be negotiated and dis counted in the state of Illinois she did not know of such intention except from what appeared on the face of the note Reynolds a member of the partnership and the payee therein named took the note to Chicago and negotiated it for the purpose of securing loans The defendant Elizabeth J Chapman relied upon tht defense that she had no capacity to make the contract in question under section 2349 of the Code of 1886 of the state of 508RECENT IMPORTANT DECISIONS Alabama which provides that the wife shall not directly or indirectly become surety for her husband Held that the capacity of Mrs Chapman to contract must be determined by the law of the state where the contract was executed Union National Bank v Chapman 1902 169 N Y 538 57 L1 R A 513 The courts seem to be divided in regard to the law controlling such con tracts Some courts hold that the law of the place where the contract was made controls Scudder v Union National Bank 91 U S 406 23 L ed 245 Voight v Brown 42 Hun 394 Hill v Chase 145 Mass 129 Milliken v Pratt 125 Mass 374 On the other hand it seems that there was no con tract in this case until the note was negotiated in Illinois and that the law of the place where it was to be performed should control Thompson v Taylor 1901

cases is that the law of the place where the parties intended the contract to be performed controls Grand v Livingston 158 N Y 688 53 N E 1125 CONSTITUTIONAL LAWBILL OF LADINGCONCLUSIVE EVIDENCEA statute required railway companies to provide scales for the weighing of hay grain etc shipped by the carload and made the company responsible for the full amount of the shipment It further provided that in an action against a railway company for a failure to deliver any such hay or grain the bill of lading should be conclusive proof of the amount received by such railway company In an action to recover for ashortage of hay Held that the stat ute was unconstitutional Missouri Kans e Texas Ry Co v Simon son 1902 64 Kans 802 57 L R A 765 68 Pac R 653 Four of the seven justices thought that the statute denied the railway com pany due process of law in that it deprived the courts of their judicial power of determining the weight and sufficiency of evidence That the legislature may establish a prima facie rule of evidence is well settled Pa Ry Co v McCann 1896 54 Ohio St 10 31 L R A 651 42 N E 768 56 Am St Rep 695 Chicago etc Ry Co v Jones 1894 149 Ill 361 24 L R A 141 37 N E 247 41 Am St

34 N E 759 36 Am S R 668 State v Mitchell 1892 3 S D 223 52 NW 1052 As to the power of the legislature to establish a conclusive rule of evidence the court says We do not intend to rule that there are no classes of acts or contracts that may not be made conclusive upon the parties thereto by the legislature but we do intend to hold that it is incompetent for the legislature to make that conclu sive of the fact and character which does not in reality express a contract because of fraud or mistake that may be made therein But it is difficult to imagine a class of acts or contracts not liable to fraud or mistake Fraud would be a defense under any such statute and as the minority points out the courts themselves reject evidence of mistake in case of sealed instruments The cases relied upon by the court to sustain the proposition that the legis lature cannot establish a conclusive rule of evidence are Little Rock etc Ry Co v Payne 1878 33 Ark 816 34 Am R 55 Meyer v Berlandi 1888 39 Minn 438

Hertzberg v Belsenbach 64 Tex 262 The American Rule holds that there is no duty upon the land lord to put the tenant in possession The latter being clothed with the title by virtue of the lease has his right to pursue such legal rem edies as the law has provided for gaining possession Gardner v Ketel tas 3 Hill N Y 330 38 Am Dec 637 Cozens v Stevenson Pa 5 Serg  R 421 Sigmund v Howard Bank 29 Md

leased premises LIBEL AND SLANDERREPORT OP JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGSMAGISTRATE WITH OUT JURISDICTIONDefendant published a report of an argument held in open court before a magistrate who had general jurisdiction of the matter under inquiry but not proper jurisdiction of the accuseds per son and the latter sued for libel Under a statute reports of judicial proceedings were qualifiedly privileged Held a judicial proceeding within the libel statute Lee v Brooklyn Union Pub Co N Y 103 N E 155 That reports of judicial proceedings are qualifiedly privileged is an established rule of the common law Hoare v Silverlock 9 C B 20 But the early English cases and some of the early American ones fol lowing the English decisions held that reports of proceedings ex parte or inter partes before magistrates do not come within the rule Dun can v Thwaites 3 B  C 556 Stanley v Webb 6 N Y Super Ct 4 Sandf 21 2 Code Rep 153 Cincinnati Gazette Co v Timberlake 10 Ohio St 548 78 Am Dec 285 When

novel impression in America but there are several English cases that strongly support the decision In the first of these it was held that a full and correct report of pro ceedings taking place before a magistrate on the preliminary investi gation of a criminal charge terminating in the discharge of the accused was privileged Lewis v Levy El Bl  El 537 A second case practically in point decides that a report of an ex parte proceeding before a police magistrate in a matter over which he has no jurisdiction and dismissed by him for that cause is qualifiedly privileged Usill v Hales L R 3 C P D 319 A later case strongly upholds this decision Kimber v Press Assn L R 1893 1 Q B 65 The point is well taken in the principal case that if the proceeding 411VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW was one which the public had a right to hear then the defendant had the right in the public interest to report it the burden not being upon him to determine doubtful questions of law as to the jurisdiction MASTER AND SERVANTPROCUREMENT OF DISCHARGE WHERE CONTRACT Is TERMINABLE AT WILLThe defendant maliciously procured the discharge of the plaintiff from her employment which was for an indefinite time Held he is liable in damages though the plaintiff had no right of action against her employer Warschauser v Brooklyn Furniture Co 144 N Y Supp 257 App Div In such cases the right of the employer to discharge the employee is generally held to be immaterial Chambers v Probst 145 Ky 381 140 S W 572 Moran v Dunphy 177 Mass 485 59 N E 125 83 Am St Rep 289 52 L R A 115 Perkins v Pendleton 90 Me 166 38 Atl 96 60 Am

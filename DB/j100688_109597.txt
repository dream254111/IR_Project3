PROMISED TO CONTINUE THEIR RESEARCHES ON THE SUB JECT SOME GREAT AND IMPORTANT FACT MUST HE THINKS ISSUE FROM THEIR LABOURS AN INVESTIGATION OF ALL THE CHANGES OF THE VARIABLE STAR IN SOBIESKIS SHIELD FROM FIVE YEARS OBSERVATIONS EXHIBITING ITS PROPORTIONAL IL LUMINATED PARTS AND ITS IRREGULARITIES OF ROTATION WITH CONJECTURES RESPECTING UNENLIGHTENED HEAVENLY BODIES BY EDWARD PIGOTT ESQ IN A LETTER TO THE RIGHT HON SIR JOSEPH BANKS KB PRS READ FEBRUARY 7 1805 PHIL TRANS 1805 P 131 MR PIGOTT SOME YEARS AGO PRESENTED TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY A PAPER WHICH IS PRINTED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS FOR THE YEAR 1797 ON THE PERIODICAL CHANGES OF BRIGHTNESS OF TWO FIXED STARS THE FIRST PART OF THE PRESENT PAPER CONSISTS OF A SERIES OF OBSERVATIONS MADE SINCE THOSE OF THE FORMER PAPER DURING THE SPACE OF NEARLY FIVE YEARS ON ONE OF THE SAID STARS NAMELY THAT IN SOBIESKIS SHIELD THESE OBSERVATIONS ARE FULLY DETAILED IN VARIOUS TABLES AND MEAN RESULTS ARE DEDUCED FROM THE OBSERVATIONS GIVEN IN THE FORMER PAPER AND FROM THOSE DESCRIBED IN THE PRESENT ONE THE RESULTS ARE AS FOLLOWSROTATION OF THE STAR ON ITS AXIS 62 DAYSDURATION OF BRIGHTNESS AT ITS IMAXIINUM WITHOUT ANY PERCEPTIBLE CHANGE 9 D AYS DURATION OF BRIGHTNESS WHEN IT DOES NOT ATTAIN ITS USUAL BRIGHTNESS 20 DAYSDURATION OF BRIGHTNESS AT ITS MINIMUM WITHOUT ANY PER CEPTIBLE CHANGE 9 DAYSDITTO WHEN IT DOES NOT DECREASE SO MUCH AS USUAL 20 DAYSDECREASE IN TIME FROM THE MIDDLE OF ITS FULL BRIGHTNESS TO THE MIDDLE OF ITS LEAST 33 DAYSINCREASE OF TIME FROM THE MIDDLE OF ITS LEAST BRIGHTNESS TO THE MIDDLE OF ITS FULL 29 DAYSEXTREMES OF ITS DIFFERENT DEGREES OF BRIGHTNESS 5TH TO 9TH MAGNITUDEMEAN OF ITS USUAL VARIATION 5TH TO 6TH MAGNITUDE IN THE SECOND PART OF THIS PAPER MR PIGOTT PROCEEDS TO EXAMINE SOME OF THE OTHER PHENOMENA BELONGING TO THIS STAR PARTICULARLY ONE WHICH HE SAYS IS COMMON TO MOST OF THE VARIABLES AND LIKEWISE IN SOME DEGREE TO OUR SUN NAMELY THAT THE TIMES OF THEIR PERIODICAL RETURNS OF BRIGHTNESS ARE IN GENERAL IRREGULAR IN HOPES OF MAKING SOME DISCOVERY RESPECTING THE CAUSE OF THESE IRREGULARITIES OR AT LEAST OF ASSISTING FUTTURE ASTRONOMERS TO FORM SOME OPINION RESPECTING THEM MR PIGOTT MADE A SERIES OF OBSERVATIONS ON THE STAR HERE TREATED OF BEGINNING IN OCTOBER 1795 AND ENDING IN OCTOBER 1801 THESE OBSERVATIONS ARE DETAILED AT FULL LENGTH IN TWO TABLES AND IT APPEARS FROM THEM THAT THE PERIODICAL RETURNS OF BRIGHTNESS ARE UNCOMMONLY FLUCTUATING AND THAT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE EXTREMES ARE VERY CONSIDERABLE MR PIGOTT THEN BY WAY OF EXPLANATION OFFERS THE FOLLOWING OPINIONS AND INFERENCES 1ST THAT THE BODIES OF THE STARS ARE DARK AND SOLID 2NDLY THAT THEIR REAL ROTATION ON THEIR AXES IS REGULAR FOLLOWING UNLIFORNM IMPULSES 3RDLY THAT THE SURROUNDING MEDIUM DOES AT TIMNES GENERATE AND181 ABSORB ITS LUMINOUS PARTICLES IN A MANNER NEARLY SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH DR HERSCHEL HAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE PLACE WITH REGARD TO THE SUNS ATMOSPHERE 4THLY THAT AS THE VARIABLE STAR IN SOBIESKIS SHIELD IS OCCASIONALLY DIMINISHED IN APPEARANCE TO THE 6TH OR 7TH MAGNITUDE OR EVEN TO A SMALLER MAGNITUDE IT APPEARS THAT THESE LUMINOUS PARTICLES ARE BUT SPARINGLY DISPERSED IN ITS ATMOSPHERE 5THLY HE ASKS MAY WE NOT WITH MUCH PLAUSIBILITY REPRESENT SUCH LUMINOUS PARTICLES AS SPOTS SOMEWHAT CIRCULAR AND OF NO GREAT EX TENT 6THLY THAT THE PRINCIPAL BRIGHT PARTS ARE BUT SLIGHT PATCHES MAY HE SAYS BE PRESUMED FROM THE PERPETUAL CHANGES THEY UNDERGO AND ALSO FROM SUCH CHANGES BEING VERY VISIBLE TO US 7THLY HE THINKS WE MAY OBTAIN SOME IDEA OF THE RELATIVE SITUATION OR INTERVALS BETWEEN THESE BRIGHT PARTS BY THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE INCREASE AND DECREASE OF BRIGHTNESS AS THEREBY THE CHANGES AND TIMES ELAPSED ARE POINTED OUT MR PIGOTT SAYS HE HAS TRIED PRACTICALLY THE EFFECT OF THE ABOVE SUPPOSITIONS BY PLACING SMALL WHITE SPOTS ON A DARK SPHERE WHICH SPHERE BEING TURNED ROUND REPRESENTED THE VARIOUS CHANGES AS NEARLY AS COULD BE EXPECTED OF THESE CHANGES SEVERAL VIEWS ARE GIVEN AC COMPANIED WITH SOME OBSERVATIONS ON VARIABLE STARS IN GENERAL IN THE COURSE OF WHICH THE AUTHOR SUPPOSES IT PROBABLE THAT MANY STARS HAVE LOST THEIR LIGHT AND THAT THERE ARE MANY OTHERS WHICH HAVE NEVER SHOWN A GLIMPSE OF BRIGHTNESS HE EVEN ASKS WHETHER WE MAY NOT SUPPOSE THE NUMBER OF THESE UNLENLIGHTENED STARS EQUAL TO THAT OF THOSE ENDOWED WITH LIGHT IF SO HE THINKS THAT BY BEING COLLECTED TOGETHER IN CLUSTERS AS IN THE MILKY WAY THEY MUST INTERCEPT ALL MORE DISTANT RAYS AND IF FREE FROM ANY INTERVENING LIGHTS MUST AP PEAR AS DARK SPACES IN THE HEAVENS SIMILAR TO WHAT HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE MR PIGOTT AT THE CONCLUSION OF HIS PAPER SAYS HE THINKS THERE ARE STRONG REASONS TO BELIEVE THAT THE SUNS LUMINOUS APPEARANCE HAS BEEN AT TIMES CONSIDERABLY DIMINISHED ALSO THAT HE HAS LITTLE HESITATION IN CONCEIVING IT MAY AT SOME FUTURE PERIOD BE REDUCED TO SMALL PATCHES AN ACCOUNT OF SOME ANALYTICAL BEXPERIMENTS ON A MINERAL PRODUCTION FROM DEVONSHIRE CONSISTING PRINCIPALLY OF A LUMINE AND WATER BY HUMPHRY DAVY ESQ FRS PROFESSOR OF CHEMISTRY IN THE ROYAL INSTITUTION READ FEBRUARY 28 1805 PHIL TRANS 1805 P 155 THE MINERAL OF WHICH AN ACCOUNT IS HERE GIVEN BY MR DAVY WAS FOUND MANY YEARS AGO BY DR WAVEL IN A QUARRY NEAR BARNSTAPLE IT WAS THEN CONSIDERED AS A KIND OF ZEOLITE BUT MR HATCHETT WHO VISITED THE PLACE IN THE YEAR 1796 DESCRIBES IT AS FILLING SOME CAVITIES AND VEINS IN A ROCK OF SOFT ARGILLACEOUS SCHISTUS AND FROM THAT CIR CUMSTANCE CONCLUDED THAT IT MOST PROBABLY DID NOT BELONG TO THE

DISCUSSION AND CORRESPONDENCE A PROPOSED CLASSIFICATION OF THE ATTITUDE OF GEOLOGIC SURFACES THE familiar classification of folds has long been used by the geologist in working with oil and gas Its inadequacy for his purposes is apparent when one considers that the deter mining factor in the gravitational separation of gas oil and water is not the general plane of the bed but the actual surface constituting the roof or floor of the reservoir This may differ from the general plane of the bed due not only to irregularity of deposition but also to irregularity of cementation since the res ervoir frequently constitutes only a portion of the sandstone bed A mere classification of folds will not suffice because it is the upper or the lower surface which concerns us and they are frequently not parallel A lenticular bed which lies in general hori zontal is not a fold at all nor is one lying in a plane monocline Yet the upper and lower surfaces of either of these have an attitude which is of great moment to the oil geologist and must be considered along with the folded surfaces The following classification of geological surfaces is therefore presented here in the be lief that it will be applicable to other geolog ical problems as well as to those of the oil and gas geologist There are four prime divisions 1 Aclineno inclination 2 Monoclineinclination in one general direction 3 Anticlineinclination away from a point or axis 4 Synclineinclination toward a point or axis Acline The acline is of small importance because one finds so generally that there is at least a 450 SCIENCESCIENCE slight inclination to beds either deforma tional or depositional The terrace is an acline interrupting a monocline which continues with the same dip direction both above and below the acline The horizontal bed is rare because a beds are generally laid down on a shore which is an inclined surface and b when the shore is raised at the time of emergence some tilting will usually result Even if as a whole it is flat the upper and lower surfaces are likely to have an inclination because of differences in deposition compacting or cementation Monocline Monocline is a muchabused term Some authors use it for what Scott more discrimi natingly calls a monoclinal flexure a single sharp bend connecting strata which lie at different levels and often horizontal except along the line of flexure A more desirable use is that of Grabau Chamberlain and Salis bury and the Century Dictionary who follow the author of the term H D Rogers in apply ing it simply to beds  dipping in one direc tion The monocline may be subdivided into three primary types 1 The plane monoclineall surfaces having a roughly similar degree of dip 2 The antimonocline is a curved portion of a monocline which is convex when seen from a point perpendicular to the general surface and above it This is a very common structure It is readily seen that it is analogous to an anti cline and would become one if the surface in general were tilted to a more horizontal posi tion Similarly an anticline tilted sufficiently becomes an antimonocline Orton with this aspect in mind called it an arrested anti cline 3 The synmonocline is a curved portion of a monocline which is concave when seen from a point perpendicular to the general surface and above it It bears the same relation to a syncline that the antimonocline does to the anticline 4 The monoclinal flexure In addition to these fundamental units there is the very 451 common combination of an antimonocline passing directly into a synmonocline below it For this the term monoclinal flexure has long been used To restrict the word monocline to this structure as some geologists have done is very objectionable 5 Halffold This same combination is found in the halffold which is the whole sur face from the axis of an erect anticline to the axis of an adjoining syncline or if the anti cline springs from a plane to that plane Anticline Anticlines are divisible into the following classes 1 The dome is a surface dipping outwardly in all directions from a central point or line 2 The level axis anticline is one where the surface is in general horizontal along the axis of the anticline A very elongate dome may have a middle portion which is also a level axis anticline 3 The plunging anticline is one having the axis itself inclined An elongate dome is made up of two plunging anticlines the plunges being in general in opposite directions As stated above a level axis anticline may inter vene 4 Nose Two anticlines may cross each other This generally produces a more or less marked dome at the intersection which has radiating plunging axes The anticlines are seldom of equal magnitude If one of them is very much less than the other it is seen merely as a wrinkle in the flank of the larger one Since these are very common and con fusion arises if they are called anticlines with out qualification the descriptive name of nose is proposed A nose is a relatively minor plunging anticline on the flank of a much larger anticline or syncline or in a monocline It causes the isobaths to show a mere wave in the downdip direction Synclines Applying the foregoing distinctions to syn clines we have the opposite termsbasin level axis syncline plunging syncline and chute OCTOBER 1 1915N S VOL XLII No 1083 The term chute while new in this connec tion is needed It may be defined as a minor plunging syncline on the flank of a much larger anticline or syncline or in a monocline It causes the isobaths to make a wave in the updip direction Saddles A saddle is a down fold in the axis of an anticline or an up fold in the axis of a syncline This form partakes of the nature of both an anticline and a syncline as is evi dent if a model in sheet lead is turned upside downwhen we find it is still a saddle but at right angles to the original one For surfaces involved in recumbent erect carinate isoclinal or fan folds the present fold terms may be used without modification The greatly increased use of the geologic surface in economic geology has led to the proposal of this specific set of terms for which the current nomenclature of folds was not adequate ROSWELL H JOHNSON UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH THE ORIGIN OF THE  NITER SPOTS  IN CERTAIN WESTERN SOILS IN an article entitled  The Origin of the Niter Spots in Certain Western Soils which appeared in the Journal of the Amer ican Society of Agronomy Vol 6 No 6 Pro fessors Stewart and Peterson of the Utah Experiment Station state on pages 246 247 and 248 of the publication cited that The brown color of the niter spots is pro duced by the solvent and decomposing action of the sodium nitrate upon the organic matter of the soil in just the same way that the black color of the black alkali spots is produced by the solvent and decomposing action of the sodium carbonate upon the soil organic matter    The color of the black alkali is produced by the sodium carbonate because being the salt of a weak acid and a strong base it readily hydro lyzes producing sodium hydroxide or caustic soda which as is well known acts on carbohy drates producing a brown color the intensity of which depends on the concentration of the sodium or potassium hydroxide thus readily accounting for the production of the color of black alkali Likewise in the case of sodium or potassium ni trate the salt being the result of this union of a strong base and a stronger acid than carbonic acid does not hydrolyze so easily and as a result there is a smaller amount of sodium or potassium hydroxide present and necessarily the production of a milder color as observed in the brown alkali niter spots The sodium and potassium sul phate and chloride being the salts of strong acids and bases do not hydrolyze therefore caustic alkali is not produced and consequently the color is not produced by these alkali salts It will be seen that while the authors state that the alkali sulphates and chlorides are not hydrolyzed at all being the salts of strong acids and strong bases they assert that the nitrates are hydrolyzed though to a less ex tent than the carbonates being the salts of a stronger acid than carbonic The natural in ference is that the authors regard nitric acid as being a weaker acid than either hydrochloric or sulphuric It has long been recognized that the strength of acids depends upon their degree of ioniza tion In the third English edition of Tread wells  Analytical Chemistry Vol I p 16 we find that in N10 solution nitric and hydro chloric acids are both ionized in the extent of approximately 90 per cent while in the third English edition of Otwalds Principles of Inorganic Chemistry p 248 we find the ex tent of the ionization of hydrochloric acid in N10 solution to be 95 per cent while that of sulphuric acid is only 57 per cent It is thus evident that the view commonly accepted by chemists that hydrochloric and nitric acids are of approximately equal strength and that sulphuric acid is considerably less strong is correct Since the only salts of the alkalis which are hydrolyzed are their salts with weak acids it is clear that the sulphates being salts of a weaker acid than nitric should be hydro lyzed to a greater extent than the nitrates On page 247 Table 8 of their article Stewart and Peterson show that while a 1per cent solution of sodium nitrate dissolved 08 per cent of the organic matter of a given soil a 1percent solution of sodium sulphate ex tracted 119 per cent of it that is to say 4875 452 SCIENCE

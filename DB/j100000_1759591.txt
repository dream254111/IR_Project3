j100000,Science,1759591,The Inventor of the Vertical Camera in Photography,i300332,JULY 4 1884 SCI ever and as such a selfevident piece of stupidity as to render further discussion useless Mr Fitzgerald further says that Professor Wood has pointed out my mistakes Is he willing to say what mistakes  I am convinced that Mr Fitzgerald has never read any criticism by Professor Wood which he is willing to indorse but since he has himself made reference to these criticisms I now ask Mr Fitzgerald to state which of Professor Woods posi tions against me he regards as sound I do not believe he can find one Mr Fitzgerald is unable to find any excuse for me when I introduce the idea of a pencil of rays of in finitesimal angle unless it be that I have overlooked the fact that the energy of such a pencil is infinitesi mal I beg leave to say that the excuse and the assumption are both entirely gratuitous on his part and not in accordance with the facts In the algebraic investigation made in the original paper as well as in that given above the angle is not assumed to be in finitesimal or even small The sole excuse and the real one was that it was a form of argument which it seemed to me would put in a clear light the truth which I had otherwise established that such a process as had been proposed would heat B at the expense of A In conclusion I may be permitted to say that when Mr Fitzgerald attempts to treat the controversy which he has himself inaugurated as not worth his consideration and gives notice that he therefore thinks it not worth while to continue it he must know that he lays himself open to the suspicion that poverty of arguments and not disinclination to con troversy leads him to this decision If Mr Fitz gerald regards it as compatible with his dignity to beat a retreat on any such pretext I for one cannot agree with him H T EDDY Cincinnati June 10 Temperature of the spheroidal state In some experiments made to determine this point to avoid radiation the temperature was measured by a thermoelectric couple as in Mr Hesehuss studies The element used was composed of germansilver and iron No 22 wire The wires were hard soldered together and then bent into a loop and inserted in a glass tube filled with plasterofParis The tube was about twelve centimetres long and five millimetres bore and the polished loop projected about eight millimetres with a width of four millimetres This element was connected directly with a reflecting gal vanometer with twentyfive ohms in circuit The spheroids were formed in a spoon heated over a spirit lamp and no special precautions were taken to secure equal temperatures The loop was plunged in the spheroid and deflection noted Ten readings were thus taken with very small variations and then the loop was placed in a beaker of water almost in con tact with the bulbs of two thermometers The water was then heated till the deflection was the same as that given by the spheroid and the thermometers were read at this point both while heating and cool ing The variations of temperature were less than 1 and this part of the experiment was repeated several times The whole experimentwas repeated a number of times on different days with results all within 1 The temperature thus found was for water 90 and for alcohol 69 The size of the spheroid had no effect on the tem perature as the deflection remained constant as long as there was enough liquid to protect the loop from ENCE 5 radiation In the case of alcohol the globule could be surrounded with vaporflames until greatly reduced in size without visibly increasing the deflection Ether was experimented on but the temperature proved to be so low barely above that of the room that no satisfactory results could be obtained The series of experiments hints at a lower and less variable temperature than has usually been assigned to the spheroidal state Louis BELL Dartmouth college June 9 The inventor of the vertical camera in photography In Science No 70 Mr G Brown Goode says con cerning the invention of the vertical camera  As a matter of fact the vertical camera now used for photographing naturalhistory specimens etc is the outcome of a suggestion made in December 1869 by Professor Baird As this letter is written to put on record the history of the invention of the vertical camera it is neces sary in justice to myself and other inventors of a vertical camera to state that the notes concerning the history of the invention were omitted from my original article Science No 62 at the suggestion of the editor The facts concerning the invention and use of the vertical camera known to me at present are as follows In 1863 J Gerlach published Die photographic als hilfsmittel zu mikroskopischer forschung in which was figured and described a vertical camera In 1866 Montessier in La photographie appliquee aux recherches micrographique described and fig ured a very much improved vertical camera Both of these are figured and described in Frey  The mi croscope and microscopical technology New York 1872 In 1872 John C Moss invented a swinging vertical camera which was described and figured in the U S patentoffice report October 1877 p 961 plate page 279 This camera was also figured in the Scientific American 1877 and in Leisure hours 1879 In 1877 also appeared a description and figure of a vertical camera by Schaefer in The microscope and histology p 295 The above together with the letter of Mr Goode the note concerning Dr Danna dieus camera and the papers by myself constitute so far as I know all the published notices of a verti cal camera By the courtesy of the gentlemen named below I am enabled to make important additions to the his tory of this subject John C Moss president of the Moss engraving company in a private letter says I remember having used a camera in a vertical position in 1858 to copy daguerrotypes and tintypes  I also used the same arrangement to photo graph some shells and other small objects Dr Deecke says  I have used the camera in a vertical position since 1873 The simple alterations on the camera were devised by myself and executed in the shops of the asylum Prof E Ramsey Wright of Toronto university also uses a vertical camera but the date of its invention by him is not known to me To briefly summarize the first figure and description of a vertical camera known to me were those of Ger lach in 1863 while the first to use the vertical camera was John C Moss in 1858 Every person using this instrument so far as appears at present was an origi nator but John C Moss seems to have been the originator of the idea of a vertical camera SIMON H GAGE Ithaca June 21

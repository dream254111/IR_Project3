SHIPBUILDING Not since the early fifties has American shipbuilding enjoyed so large a measure of prosperity as that of today Nearly a half million registered tons were added last fiscal year On June I5 I9oI eightynine merchant ships and seventyone war vessels were reported as being under con struction making a total of I35 vessels with a combined tonnage capacity of 488700 tons The trade authorities report that the shipyards engaged in building steel ships have orders which will require fully twelve months to fill operating at their full capacity1 Wooden ship construction on the Maine coast and in the far northwest seems to be no less favored For the past two or three years shipbuilders have been especially occupied with the construction of ships for the countrys coasting trade and for a longer period with the building of war vessels of various types On the Atlantic seaboard the chief feature of progress in this indus try has been in naval construction and in the evolution of a larger type of manymasted schooners On the Great Lakes the steamfreighter types with a maximum tonnage of 900o tons gross register are still the characteristic contribution of these inland seas to this phase of national development The shipbuilding industry on the Pacific Coast for the past three years according to the Scienlific Americans reports has enjoyed a period of extraordinary activity From Jan uary I898 to September 1900 thirtytwo months the number of new ships built aggregated seventyfour with a total tonnage capacity of 379IO Government vessels were not included in the list Of the new craft fortyfive with a tonnage of 14229 were schooners five were barkentines of 4597 tons one was a barge of 632 tons and twentythree 1 Blue Book of American Shipping Preface 1901 46PROSPECTS OF AMERICAN SHIPBUILDING were steamers having a tonnage of 18452 The largest of the schooners rated 985 tons and of the steamers 4597 tons Of the latter three aggregating 7298 tons were built of iron the others of wood San Francisco builders were the constructors of the larger number of both iron and wooden ships but almost every port on the coast from San Pedro to Puget Sound wherever the necessary supplies of lumber were to be had contributed to the total result Cred itable as the exhibit is the outlook is even more flattering There is not a shipbuilder along the 2000 miles of coast who has not all the work contracted for that can possibly be handled and who could not easily duplicate his present undertakings if the supply of labor warranted it The cause of this prosperity is easily explained For many years prior to 1898 the industry languished and the carrying trade which had been stimulated by artificial booms was greatly depressed Dividends on marine propertywere small The earnings were swallowed up by heavy expenses Losses by sea were not made good The actual number of coast ships was considerably decreased Just at the time when the maritime prospect seemed darkest the extraordinary development of Alaska began It was found that the number of vessels available for this profitable traffic was far below the demand Every vessel that could be procured was chartered for the Alaskan trade High charters caused many to be withdrawn from the coast car rying trade and a considerable scarcity of vessels for ordinary requirements began to be felt Then camne the revival of the Oriental trade in which the Pacific ship builders found another pressing demand for their output There appears from trade returns to be no abatement at any point Owing later to South African conditions the call for ships was still further improved Besides these local evidences of prosperity the shipbuilding talent of the nation still holds the worlds pennant in the making as well as in the management of pleasure craft which the 4748 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY growth of private wealth has enabled an increasing propor tion of our citizens to enjoy Largely for this and other purposes the United States has always built ships for sale to foreigners Since the Civil War the annual tonnage of all kinds sold to foreigners has ranged from Ioooo to 80000 tons in round numbers As yet the main demand for the product of our shipyards with the exception of a few war vessels ordered by foreign governments has come from the necessities of national defense and the requirements of our domestic development But the progress of the iron and steel industry in this coun try the necessity of finding foreign markets for our surplus manufactures and the extension of railway control over lake and ocean transportation have all among other causes con tributed to inaugurate a new era in the making of ships Surplus capital is again going down to sea in ships Now for the first time in our history is shipbuilding being or ganized on an extensive scale in the consolidated companies on the Lakes on the individual enterprises on the New England coast on the Delaware River the Chesapeake Bay the bay of San Francisco and the Puget Sound On the western rivers the output is still comparatively small though not by any means losing ground The table on page 49 gives the tonnage built for twenty two years The tonnage built on the Great Lakes has hitherto had almost no relation to the demand for ocean tonnage Within a few years some vessels have left the lakes at the close of the season to engage in the coastwise trade between seasons But as a rule the lakebuilt ships have had to limit them selves to fresh water requirements Lake trade depends largely on raw materials and crude commodities Additions to tonnage on these waters are directly affected by the volume of trade in agricultural products and the raw mate rials of industry Shipbuilding today in the United States

With in a decade the capital invested has nearly trebled wages earned have likewise doubled and substantially the same may be said of both the expenditure for shipbuilding mate rials and of the value

I9go this increase was 696 per cent over that of the preceding year This rate is the highest since I855 From the latter date to the present time the tonnage figures show a series of slow recoveries and abrupt reactions in the demands of our merchant marine upon the shipyards As late as I886 more than onethird of the annual increase in tonnage was sold to foreigners Spasms of promise have so frequently been followed by colPROSPECTS OF AMERICAN SHIPBUILDING lapse that in spite of our growing foreign commerce and our increasing importance as a naval power our shipbuilding has concerned itself almost exclusively with meeting the requirements of our coastwise and interior commerce This is well brought out by a comparison of the docu mented tonnage in foreign and domestic trade and in fish eries on June 30 i86i when the United States still had prominent rank in foreign trade with that on June 30 I9OI when the total tonnage was nearly equal to that o forty years ago The table shows

exacting It was not that national lethargy had dulled the desire for ships as some would have us think That analysis is eco nomically false to facts For the time being our hands as a nation were fullfull of work as honorable as shipbuilding and ocean commerce and far more urgent and fundamental The dominance of internal affairs over foreign commerce began to appear by the end of the first quarter of the cen 1 The Shipping Industry in the United States p 13S3 United States Treasury Bureau of Statistics December I900 5152 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY tury Even as early as the war of 1812 our national prob lems gradually ceased to be maritime and became territorial In I824 a group of New York shipowners protested to Con gress against the policy of economic isolation by which capital and labor were induced to desert ocean commerce for the more remunerative pursuits of internal development Only so long as that policy was in doubt did our ships main tain a foremost rank among maritime powers As soon however as the  American policy of economic isolation became continuous then capital and labor employed in ship ping and consequently in shipbuilding for ocean trade found themselves placed on an entirely different basis of earning power compared with that portion of the national capital and labor devoted to internal development Capital devoted to shipbuilding for the sea trade had to earn returns under the stress of competition in the open worlds markets while the products of capital and labor within the national limits were sold in the national market within which the prevailing rate of returns has always been higher than in the international market On footings so clearly unequal in a period of economic activity when the demand for labor and capital as a rule exceeded the supply it was inevitable that the decadence of our merchant marine should coincide with the development of our domestic resources Now again the national interests have by the logic of events become maritime Meanwhile the economic life of the people has also become more complex and comprehen sive in its needs From being primarily agricultural it has become industrial and then commercial It is all of these that call for ships Changes in our commercial relations with the world market have greatly modified the national attitude toward shipbuilding The gains of our exports upon our imports during the latest decade have thrown upon the American producer the burden of finding oversea mar kets for a growing surplus Growth in volume of ocean commerce of itself introducesPROSPECTS OF AMERICAN SHIPBUILDING a new element into the question of the national demand for ships By transferring an increasing proportion of the national surplus to the custody of the seas to find markets it calls for a more complete control of carrying agencies by those directly responsible for national prosperity Private and public interests seem to coincide in requiring that no nation of an exporting rank such as is nov held by the United States should delegate its maritime commerce to its national rivals The maritime arm of the distributive system on which we are dependent for finding and holding such markets as our surplus needs thus becomes part of the more complete commercial equipment which progress from an agricultural to a commercial nation has forced upon us Until recently the emphasis was put on the home market in national dis cussion Now we speak as world merchants and as world financiers These comprehensive aims all tend to force sur plus capital into a merchant marine now that other channels of investment are no longer prejudicially profitable com pared with shipping and shipbuilding Between the home market and the world market the bridge of a national mer chant marine is a logical necessity The present status of American shipbuilding has still fur ther to be looked at from points of view that are peculiarly its own The industry as it stands now is clearly connected in its development with the naval policy of the national govern ment This policy has resulted in calling into existence more shipbuilding plants operating on a larger scale and with more permanent conditions than the commercial demand succeeded in doing It has drawn together mechanical equipment and engineering talent of a superior order to exe cute its contracts It has distributed these contracts among shipyards on the seacoasts of the Atlantic and the Pacific in such a way as to equip every one of our great oceanic inlets excepting those on the Gulf Coast with superior shipyards It has by insisting that its vessels should be the products of 5354 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY American skill and material and of American model and design attracted investing capital and constructive labor All of these have helped to lay the foundations of a new order of things It is true that the influence of naval policy is usually quite indirect in its effects on commercial ship building but the connection has been none the less promo tive of industrial efficiency in this field Competition among shipyards for governmental contracts has taken a wider range and been perceptibly keener with each successive award Besides this general result the high standard of workmanship required on governmental work has improved the grade and quantity of mechanical ability as applied to the building of steel merchant ships especially Possibly there has been some disadvantage in turning a force of work men from governmental work where extreme carefulness is required to commercial work where so high a degree of fin ish and nicety are not essential But in the long run it can not be disputed that the wholesale building of warships has helped to create large plants out of small ones and to develop the large ones to a point at which it is no longer industrially necessary to look to foreign shipyards for our merchant fleets of the future A still more direct effect of naval policy upon commercial shipbuilding is seen where the mercantile aux iliaries constitute a feature of the merchant marine subject to naval service in time of war From what has already been said it is plain that our com mercial prosperity has put us face to face with the shipping question At present our financiers who underwrite our commercial organizations are buying foreign ships in the effort to bring railway and ocean rates of freight under com mon control If financial considerations are allowed to gov ern in these consolidations of distributive agencies on land and on sea as they undoubtedly will it is not any longer a question as to where the ships will come from One thing is certain namely that hitherto the ocean trade has not been in the habit of coming to the United States for its shipsPROSPECTS OF AMERICAN SHIPBUILDING Now however that the demand for the establishment of a national merchant marine is heard with increasing insist ence the question of the capacity of the American shipyards to supply the ships is foremost Can American shipyards build merchant ships at a cost that will enable shipping interests to operate them in open competition with vessels from the older establishments of Great Britain or even with those of Germany  The answer to such a question involves comparisons very difficult to make on a common basis The methods of work the differ ences in design cost of materials wages superintendence interest depreciation and insurance expenses of operation and other items including the advantages of production on a large scale have to be taken into account One fact seems to be established beyond doubt namely that the first cost of an Americanbuilt ship is greater than that of a Brit ishbuilt ship of exactly the same size dimensions and speed The same seems to be true of German work On this basis of capital cost the depreciation interest and insurance would probably amount to fifteen per cent per annum as fixed charges other than direct expenses of operation If the Americanbuilt vessel cost 1846800 and the Britishbuilt vessel cost 1419120 these fixed charges would be respec tively 277020 and 212868 leaving the Britishbuilt ves sel with an advantage of 64 I52 annual outlay on first cost These figures are taken from actual examples of construc tion cost in leading British and American shipyards to each of which identical contracts were awarded for vessels of the same plan and type If this single instance be not taken as conclusive evidence on the subject of relative cost it is neces sary to go farther to show that in dealing with the world wide problem of shipbuilding for the ocean trade the Amer ican yards and the European yards still stand on a quite different basis as competitors It would probably not be disputed that in bridgebuilding 1 Report of Commissioner of Navigation i90o pages 2324 5556 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY Americans easily lead the British and the Germans And the unanimous opinion would be that it is the result of our experience during a half century of bridging streams under such a variety of conditions as to make us masters of almost any possible problem that may arise anywhere else in the world Precisely the same may be said in explanation of the success of British and the relative failure of American shipbuilding No field of commercial and industrial inves ment has been more liberally supplied with capital by the banks and the investing public than the shipbuilding and shipping interests of Great Britain On the other hand no American interest has been until recently so completely ignored as a rule by banks and investors generally as these phases of national enterpriseshipping and ship building Until within a few years the American banker considered shipbuilding as an industry lying without the pale of legiti mate investment He belonged to a generation which knew nothing of the subject and cared less about it when this field of investment was called to his attention The history of American shipbuilding like that of American farming for the past fifty years is one of brave struggle to maintain an industry with a minimum of capital and hence a maximum of cost accompanied by the hazard of periodical depression Financially it has been the most neglected of all our national industries Compare this with British shipbuilding of which an expe rienced shipbuilder on the Pacific has said that it is the result of the very things we have notprolonged and wide experience gained by shipowners and sailors the embodi ment of the principles of designing to meet universal condi tions the solution of problems worked out by the joint labors of naval architect machinist registration authorities and public criticism American shipyards are still in the stage of adaptation to local conditions for the most part On the lakes within the limits of the local traffic requirements the problems have been worked out as they arose with a highPROSPECTS OF AMERICAN SHIPBUILDING degree of success Likewise on the seaboard coastwise trade has preoccupied the attention of constructive progress so that the cost has been brought within the limits of fairly profitable operation But for the far greater problem of con struction at a cost that will warrant investors in entering upon ocean competition our shipyards have not yet proved themselves masters of their part of the situation In shop equipment American shops seem to excel in small tools and lifting appliances used in the handling of material There are no such complete and economical methods of handling tools and materials by electricity anywhere in Europe as those of the Eastern Shipbuilding Company at New London and the New York Shipbuilding Company at Camden N J In large tools the American shop does not appear to be any better off In engine building as well as in the construction of the hull the system of piece work is reduced to such a degree of precision in English shipyards that it is known or easily ascertained just what part of the total labor cost of a ship is to be charged to these parts of the work Then there is a settled method of determining compensation for unit of product while here no such uni formity has ever been agreed to In spite of our advances in standardization in some directions particularly in sta tionary engines no such a complete system has been arrived at in the building of marine engines as that in British prac tice where every part of an engine is gauged with precision to test the accuracy of the workmens operations and the precision of the mechanics and tools used so that without setting up the parts they may be sent to the ends of the earth with absolute certainty of fitting A comparison of foreign and domestic conditions leads to the impression that our shipbuilding industry is not evenly developed In parts it is weak as for instance in the development of standards of uniform cost of work Higher wages per diem than is paid abroad still cover a multitude of sins of omission to organize work on the basis of results 5758 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY accurately measured by uniform methods In this direction there is room for development if shipbuilding is to be brought up to the standard of organization in other indus tries It has been stated that a standardgauge system would reduce the cost of engine erection by as much as 50 per cent Under American methods the same authority estimates that the labor cost on the hull of an average ocean going freight and passenger steamer in an American yard is 25 per cent more and the machinery 50 per cent more Yet it is conceded that in point of quantity or output in skill in design in handling machinery and in management our working force is superior Possibly the main reason for the difference in cost charge able against our work lies in the variety of work which a shipyard has to do to keep itself goingin the United States Foreign shipyards have a continuous volume of work of a similar character while our own yards work constantly on dissimilar designs and diverse specifications so that it is the exception rather than the rule that the workman becomes familiar with his work from repetition of it in one ship after another Almost every governmental order includes a more or less radical departure from previous specifications so that naval requirements have hindered rather than helped toward reduction of cost by promoting similarity of type in con struction It is a matter of common knowledge that new types increase cost while standard types decrease cost Pro test after protest has been recorded against this mania for differentiation in type but with little avail In recently built merchant ships both on the lakes and on the seaboard the duplication of designs has become a matter of more frequent occurrence Another element of weakness in the shipbuilding situation in the United States is the large number of small and half equipped yards and the small number of wellestablished ones Excepting the Cramp shipyards at Philadelphia and possibly a few of lesser note the United States has neverPROSPECTS OF AMERICAN SHIPBUILDING had a plant which devoted itself exclusively to this business without sooner or later meeting with financial failure This is the record of the past twentyfive or thirty years When demand for ships fell off the small yards have gone out of business for the time being When prosperous trade called for more ships these very yards were given the contracts In this way the burden for conserving and developing ship building skill fell almost wholly on the few yards which remained in the business all the time The wonder is not that we cannot build ships so cheaply as they are made in foreign yards but that we can build them as well as we do under such conditions The readiness with which a new plant can be called into existence or an abandoned one revived to get contracts is one of the marvels of this industry to foreigners It would not be fair to shipbuilders to omit one of their greatest difficulties in their attempt to develop their industry a difficulty moreover which lies beyond their power to remedy under existing conditions of organization No single element has been more embarrassing than the fluctuation in the prices of steel plates and angles The price of ship building steel has been known to increase 250 per cent in four months This has no doubt somewhat abated but on so high a level of prices as not to encourage the domestic manufacture of steel ships British builders have the advan tage of the steadying influences of the worlds competition on prices of steel materials For that reason they need never fear American competition in this field under existing differences in the cost of structural material The high prices of steel material at home have no doubt something to do with the fact that on the seaboard 43557 gross tons of wooden schooners and steamers were built last year com pared with 73374 gross tons of steel steamers Nevertheless American shipbuilders and architects have made wonderful progress within a decade They have gath ered together the experience of the world on the subject They have worked diligently and often unnoticed at every 596o ANNALS Or THHE AMERICAN ACADEMY phase of the problem They have demonstrated their ability to design and construct in the most satisfactory manner with regard to time and efficiency standard types of vessels for naval and mercantile service Among the distinct con tributions of this country to the making of ships should be mentioned the application of electrical power to the opera tion of machinery tools cranes and other hoisting and hand ling methods and the invention of small power tools such as riveting chipping caulking and drilling appliances All these advances lie in the direction of reduction in cost for unit of output From this point of departure in further development two tendencies are at work Within shipyards a more economical organization of the productive processes is going on to reduce costs by eliminating the unessential and by putting the emphasis on the essential elements of outlay Such a process is slow and its results are not so quickly diffused from plant to plant as might be expected notwithstanding the splendid spirit of comity among rival shipbuilders The other tendency lies outside of the indus try itself in the reduced cost of making shipbuilding mate rials and in the growth of the demand for ships as a necessary extension of our distributive system The problem of reducing the first cost of ships to the European level will have been solved when the annual output of our ship yards is five times what it now is It is all a question of the vol ume of demand required by national development The joint outcome of these two tendencies is inevitable Mean while in spite of all drawbacks the outlook is not only encouraging but inspiring Our national outlook has shifted to the sea politically geographically and commercially With this fact once fixed in the national consciousness clearly enough to see its connection with our past history and our present opportunity it is not probable that any time will be lost in higgling over the terms on which these instruments of maritime power shall be called into

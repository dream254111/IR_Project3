chromosome that carries the lethal factor They are saved by the other sex chromosome but they will transmit the fatal dose to half of their sons who die and to half of their daughters who live The same test has been made with another sexlinked character viz miniature wings and the same results obtained If however the lethal factor separates from the redwhite fac tor R  W only once in 200 times it must be near that factor on my hypothesis of the linear order of the factors in the chromo somes If it does then we can calculate how often the crossing over for the wing factor should occur In brief we predicted the ratio of long and miniaturewinged males that are expected in the back cross i e how many longwinged males would escape the fatal dose The prediction was verified For example in F2 there were obtained L  L Md 910 156 243 The number of crossover males is 156 the number expected for the total number 399 of males is 133 this excess of long males is in the direction which the known differences in viability of long versus miniature might pro duce Similarly for the sexlinked factor for  eosin eyes This factor lies near to the factor for red R hence in an experiment similar to the one with white eyes redeyed males should be rare Up to the present time 411 F eosin males have emerged and one red eyed male The expectation is two red males to 400 eosin males T H MORGAN COMPLETE LINKAGE IN THE SECOND CHROMOSOME OF THE MALE OF DROSOPHILA IT has been shown recently that the non sexlinked factors that give black and wingless flies are linked to each other In the F2 gen eration from P black winged by gray wing less there were produced Morgan and Lynch Biol Bull Vol XXIII p 174 August 1912 GW 2316 BW 1146 Gw 737 No black wingless flies appeared which seemed due to close linkage between the fac tors in question Yet when F gray wingless females were tested by breeding to black winged males quite a number of black flies were obtained in the first generation 15 to 125 The explanation offered was that crossingover or breaking the linkage oc curred so rarely that in the production of the F generation no two wingless black gametes had happened to meet In order to test how often crossingover oc curred the experiment was repeated but this time the F females and males were tested for crossovers by mating them to black wingless flies Thus black winged females were mated to gray wingless males and gave F gray winged flies The F males were tested with black wingless females and gave BW BW  Gw  Gw c 514 478 355 366 These results show that there has been no crossingover in the F heterozygous males The converse cross was as follows Gray winged females were bred to black wingless males and produced gray winged males and females The F males were bred as before to black wingless females and gave GW GW J Bw  Bw S 213 171 154 123 Here again the combination that went into the F male remained intact Similar crosses in which the F females were tested gave

be no longer any need to assume as Bateson and Punnett have done that there is A a system of partial coupling B a system of complete repulsion or spurious allelomorphism or to assume C a system of special dichotomous ratios for coupling such as 31 and 7 1 etc T I MORGAN ale is obvious In THE PROBABLE RECENT EXTINCTION OF THE ily one sex chromo MUSKOX IN ALASKA rossingover impos THE question of

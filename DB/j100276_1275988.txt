quits work to obtain a drink of water Jarvis v Hitch I6i Ind 217 65 N E 608 Birmingham Rolling Mill Co v Rockhold 143 Ala II5 42 So 96 Such acts are said to be what the parties may be reasonably held to have considered necessary to the discharge of the duties of almost any kind of manual labor In Vennen v New Dells Lumber Co supra the em ployer was held liable for the death of an employee of typhoid fever due to impurities in the water furnished by the employer the court saying that the death had resulted from an injury growing out of and incidental to his employment Care must be taken to distinguish between an accidental in jury arising as did the injury in the principal case and occupational dis eases at least in those jurisdictions where the latter are not held to war rant recovery under the Compensation Acts The distinction is made clear in the case of Bacon v IMutual Accident Association 123 N Y 304 25 N E 399 WORKMENS COMPENSATIONOCCUPATIONAL DISEAsEDefendant was employed by a whitelead manufacturer and wlhile thus employed contracted lead poisoning and was disabled from work He made application in due form for compensation under the WORKMENS COMPENSATION LAW I02 Ohio Laws 524 but the Industrial Commission disallowed the claim The county court reversed this ruling the Court of Appeals affirmed its decision and the employer and the Commission appealed to the Supreme Court The statute provides for recoveries for personal injuries sustained in the course of employment Held that the statute does not cover injury or death resulting from disease contracted in the course of such employment Indus trial Commission of Ohio v Brown Ohio I915 IIo N E 744 When the word accident appears in the statute there does not seem to be any doubt that occupational diseases are not included The distinction between accident and disease has always been recognized In England in the case of Sleele v Calnnmell Laird Co 1905 2 K B 232 it was held that the statute providing for recovery for personal injury arising from accident did not include diseases resulting from the nature of the work itself Later a statute 6 Edw VIII c 58 specifically provided for such recovery The difference of opinion arises when the term accident does not appear in the statute and recovery is to be allowed for all personal injuries arising out of or sustained in the course of the employment Massachusetts has held that such a statute does include occupational dis eases In re Hurle 217 Mass 223 104 N E 336 and Johnson v London Guarantee  Accident Co 217 Mass 388 104 N E 735 Such has been the holding in the Court of Appeals in New Jersey Hichens v Magnus Metal Co 35 N J Law Journal but the question has never been decided by the court of last resort On the other hand under practically the same statute Michigan holds that the term personal injuries does not include occupational diseases Adams v Acme White Lead and Color Works 182 Mich I57 148 N W 485 The court in this case notices the Massachusetts cases but declines to follow them For a review of the statutes in the dif 526RECENT iMPORTANT DECISIONS ferent states see BRADBURY WORKMENS COMPENSATION 342360 The prin cipal case changes the former rule in Ohio in so far as it had been decided by the Superior Court in Plasko v American Carriage Co I5 N P N S 273 4 N C C A 843 WORKMENS COMPENSATIONSTATE AND FEDERAL AcTsA was employed as a laborer by B a carrier doing intra and interstate business While tamping ties A was struck in the right eye by a stone which came from the ground There was no negligence on the part of B The New York Work mens Compensation Commission awarded A compensation B contends that as it was doing interstate business the Federal Employers Liability Act applied and that A could not recover because negligence on the part of the employer was a necessary element Held that the state law and not the federal law applies on the theory that the injury came within a class to which the Federal Employers Liability Act was not meant to apply Win field v N Y C  H R R Co N Y 1915 IIo N E 614 Congress passed an Employers Liability Act in I9o8 applicable to inter state carriers providing they shall be liable in damages to any employee suffering injury while employed by such carrier in such commerce due to the negligence of any of its officers agents or employees etc It will be noticed that negligence is a necessary element to the right of recovery by an employee The New York Compensation Act under which recovery was had in the principal case allows recovery even where there is no negligence The court recognized the principle that once Congress has acted in a field over which it has the power to act all prior state action is superseded Smith v Alabamza I24 U S 473 Erie R R Co v N Y 233 U S 67I 52 L R A N S 266 The decision is rested upon a rather novel ground that is that the act of Congress in question having provided for a recovery only in those cases where the carrier is negligent by necessary implication Congress did not intend the act to apply to any case in which the carrier was not negligent From this the court reasoned that Congress had not leg islated upon this particular sphere and as the state had done so recovery could be had under the state law It would certainly seem that the implica tion arising from the failure of Congress to allow a recovery where no negli gence was shown would be very strong to the effect that Congress intended that no recovery should be had in such cases In justification of the decision it may be said that where the health and safety of citizens of the state are involved any Federal statute will not be held to supersede a state law cov ering the same field unless it clearly appears that the two are inconsistent Missouri K  T R R v Haber I69 U S 613 Reid v Colo 187 U S I37 The decision might have been placed upon the ground that the Federal Lia bility Act did not apply since the defendant had been doing both intra and interstate business and since the facts did not show that the plaintiff A was employed in interstate commerce as required by the Federal Liability Act but showed rather that he was doing a class of work that applied to either 527

of chemistry  During February Prof F W Clarke and Dr T H Chatard completed analyses of waters from Utah Hot Springs Lake Tahoe and from Alum Creek in the Yellowstone National Park They have also analyzed some rocks and sediments collected in the Great Basin  Dr Chatard has begun investigations into a new method of silicate analyses the results of which promise to be of importance  Professor Clarke has analyzed halotrichite and alunogen from a large deposit at the head waters of the Gila in New Mexico saussurite from California allanite from Topsham Me a mineral near cimolite from Norway Me a hand some chlorite from Georgetown DC and an ex ceedingly interesting variety of pectolite simulating jade from Alaska Professor Clarke has also completed the analyses of two more mineralwaters from Montana collected by Dr A C Peale last summer One of them is a calcic thermal water from a spring in Emigrant Gulch on the west side of the Yellowstone valley opposite Bottlers ranch This water contains 2350 of a gram of solid matter to the litre The tempera ture of the water at the spring is 388 C and the flow of water is large The other water is also from the Yellowstone valley the spring being situated on the upper waters of Mill Creek about ten miles due east from Riverside one of the stations on the Park branch of the Northern Pacific railroad Professor Clarke finds this to be a good mineralwater It con tains 38125 grams of solid matter to the litre mainly sodium magnesium and calcium carbonates with considerable sodiumn sulphate and small propor tions of chlorides The water also contains iodine but the quantity brought to the laboratory was too small to estimate its amount This water is very agreeable to the taste It resembles very much the Apollinaris water from the valley of the Ahr in Prussia and from this resemblance the springs have been named the Mill Creek Apollinaris springs The water is cold having a temperature of 45 C Mr F A Gooch formerly of the Northern trans continental survey has been appointed assistant chemist to begin work in the laboratory at Wash ington April 1  Messrs Barus and Hallock at the laboratory at New Haven needing some capillary wire tubes and being unable to find anly have suc ceeded in making them at the laboratory Crater Lake Oregon  Among the interesting places visited by Mr J S Diller in his reconnois sance of the Cascade Range last summer was Crater Lake about two or three miles west of Mount Scott This is a body of water some three miles in diameter lying in a depression some two thousand feet below the general level surrounding it The sides are in general perpendicular and the water is of a most beautiful tint Toward the western end of the lake there is a small conical island the rock of which resembles basalt although Mr Diller has not yet made a careful examination of it The rocks form ing the walls of the lake are andesitic The general elevation of the country immediately about the lake is between two thousand and three thousand feet lower than the summit of Mount Scott Capt Dut ton is convinced from Mr Dillers description of the lake that it is homologous with the craters studied by him in the Hawaiian Islands To the latter Capt Dutton gives the name of caldeiros He says the first view of them does away with the idea that they are ordinary craters They are huge caldrons or boil ing lakes of molten rock Miscellaneous  Capt Dutton has received letters from Honolulu by the steamer leaving there March 3 which state that for the few days preceding that date the red sunsets have been exceedingly bril liant  During February Mr Vanhise one of Mr R D Irvings assistants prepared about fifty new thin rocksections among which were a large num ber of greenstones RECENT PR OCEEEDINGS OF SCIENTIFIC SO CIETIES American society of civil engineers April 2 The subject for discussion was the re duction of grades inecessary to be made upon railway curves to compensate for the ilncreased resistance to the traction of the locomotive when traversing curves in comparison with resistances encountered upon straight lines The various forces composing such resistances have been combined in a formula deduced mathematically but careful experiments which have been made tend to show that no formula has yet been found which is of general application The rules adopted upon various great railwaylines were stated but it was plain that additional information must be obtained before positive rules of general application could be given Chemical society Washington March 27Papers were read as follows F W Clarke A new variety of pectolite from Alaska  Dr J H Kidder The use of the Nessler reagent in air analyses In several cases the airwashings which were under examination gave a distinct clear green coloration in place of the characteristic yellowish brown precipitate produced by ammonia This color was also found in a few experiments upon rain and snow waters but never in dealing with drinking waters Dr Kidder is inclined to ascribe the new464 SCIENCE reaction to some organic amine and hopes to con tinue thli investigation of it C A Crainpton and H W Wiley Birotation of commercial starch sugars and a method of analysis based thereon G L Spencer A method for the determination of phosphoric acid in commercial fertilizers This was essentially an improvement on the volumetric ura niumn process  H W Wiley A method of deter mining the end reaction in sugarreductions San Diego society of natural history March 7  Mr D Cleveland made remarks relat ing to a tubular stone found in Temecula Canion sup posed by him to have been used by the Indians as a pipe Mention was also made of the Indians using the leaves of several species of Nicotiana N Clevelandi and N Bigelovii as a  substitute for tobacco  A mediumsized olla was described  by Mr C R Orcutt as haviing  ji been made by the Indians of t Lower California in imitation of  a teapot with a nose and perfora  tions in the side of the unglazed pot and which was used by them r to steep the leaves of Mentha Canadensis L  Miss K O 6   Sessions presented specimens of  a rock from San Benito county 5f  Cal which is largely used in the adulteration of soap and the best substance known for that pur   pose  Mr Jos Winchester MAP OF SOUT presented a chart representing the comparative meteorology of San Diego on San Diego Bay and Poway twelve miles from the coast dur ing the last five years showing that the rainfall is greatly less near the coast than among the hills while the humidity of the atmosphere near the coast is greater for ten months in the year than away from the coast The explanation of the chart by Mr Winchester was followed by a general discussion  Mr C R Orcutt read a few notes on the native cacti mentioning several undescribed species of this county and Lower California NOTES AND NEWS THE detailed results of Mr G F Wrights studies in 1882 and 1883 of the southernmost drift margin in the Ohio valley are recently published by the Western reserve historical society The pamphlet includes a revised reprint of Mr Wrights lecture on glacial phenomena in the Ullited States from which we copy in reduced form the accompanying figure of part of the drift boundary in the states examined Several other cuts illustrate the boundary by counties in much greater detail The description of the district opposite Cincinnati where the effects of iceaction are traced across the Ohio into Kentucky is still con fessedly incomplete but so far as observed there is VOL III No 62 no question of the presence of true unmodified glacial drift south of the river It is to be noticed that another invasion of Kentucky is marked on the map here giveIn farther down the valley at Madison and that the retreat of the glaciated area towards Indiarlapolis seems to mark the division between two lobelike extensions of the drift which are now found to be frequently characteristic of the old icefront wherever studied in detail The report attempts little of novelty in its subjectmatter being confined closely to questions of distribution but the contin ual repetition of the familiar evidences of glaciation scratchled rocks heavy till large granite bowlders kames and kettleholes  limited by a line of great HERN INDIANA AND OHIO SHOWING GLACIAL BOUNDARY irregularity both horizontally and vertically presents precisely the definite commoniplace proof that is wanted in connection with the many scattered obser vations heretofore made  The trustees of the Peabody academy of science at Salem have decided to make a fireproof additional building seventy by fifty feet and two stories high The additioiis to the ethnological collections espe cially from Japan and Corea have been very consider able during the past year A recent calculation of the population anid area of Australia states that there are only three human beings to every four square miles The London society of arts has received a dona tion of twelve hundred pounds from one of its mem bers Mr William Westgarth to be expended on prizes for the best essays on dwellings for the poor and the reconstruction of central London The essays should include the following points 1 The reconstruction of the central part of London with regard to the plan of the streets 2 Removal of the old and poisoned soil 3 Rearrangement of the levels and provision of subterranean ways for the accommodation of electric wires pipes for watersupply sewage etc and also provision for warehousing The prizes for these essays will be one of five

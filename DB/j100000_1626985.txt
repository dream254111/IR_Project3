motion is the sacrum where three vertebrae are completely coa lesced to the summits of the spines besides a fourth ribbearing sacral with a free spine The sacroiliac union is by means of both ribs and neuropophysial plates The presence of such plates in all the anterior caudals as first described by the writer proves that the sacrum is reenforced by additions from the anterior caudals 2 There are more than thirty caudals and three distinct types of chevron instead of the single type to which Marsh ap plied the generic name Diplodocus The tail was undoubtedly a powerful swimming organ and also a lever by means of which the anterior portion of the body was ele vated the acetabulum serving as a fulcrum while the trunk was immersed in water This power did not exist upon land as in the Iguanodontia The Ossicula Auditus of the Mammalia J S KINGSLEY and W H RUDDICH STUDIES on embryo pigs and rats show that the incus is the quadrate the malleus the proximal end of Meckels cartilage These cannot be homologized with the columellar chain of Sauropsida since they are in front of the spiracular cleft and in front of the chorda tympani while the columella is behind the spiracle and chorda tympani The incus quadrate articulates with the stapes in the mam mals exactly as is the case in the urodeles Nothing similar occurs in the Saurop sida This is regarded as additional evi dence that the mammals have had an am phibian ancestry The quadrate cannot have disappeared in the glenoid fossa as maintained by Albrecht and Cope as this would involve a translation of parts impos sible to explain The mammalian lower jaw articulates by means of the dentary rather than by means of the articulalare i e its articulation is not homologous with that in lower groups A longer summary of the

rendered helpless or actually perished during the severe storm of Feb ruary last was numerically expressed and it was shown that there was not only a measurable but a striking physical differ ence between the birds which actually suc cumbed and those which survived the storm The birds which perished were longer heavier possessed of shorter heads shorter leg bones of less breadth of skull and of reduced sternum while those which sur vived tended toward the possession of char acters opposite to these While these average differences between the two groups of birds were emphasized attention was also called tQ the fact that the individuals of extreme variability occurred most frequently among the birds which per ished The longest bird and the shortest bird in the entire collection perished the same is true of the one having the greatest and the one having the least alar extent The heaviest bird died the one with the longest and the one with the shortest head died and the one with the shortest humerus the one with the longest femur the one with the longest and the one with the shortest skull and the one with the shortest keel to 316 SCIENCESCIENCE its sternumall died The average oscilla tion of variation around an ideal mean was also shown to be almost invariably in excess for the birds which perished and the con clusions arrived at were as follows The birds which perished were not simply accidental sufferers from the severity of the storm but were birds which were physically disqualified for enduring the intensity of the New England climate as expressed by the storm of February 1st and they were con sequently eliminated by natural agents The result of this elimination produced in this particular locality a colony of birds measurably different from those existing be fore the storm that is the action of natural selection resulted in the elimination of the unfit and the survival of the fit On the Anatomy of the Spermatozoon of In vertebrates G W FIELD With demon stration of the apical body THE widest diversity in the form of the spermatozoon is found among the different groups of the invertebrated animals Closer examination shows that there is however one type of form which obtains in by far the greater majority of species and that the aberrant forms are peculiar to those species which have either become parasitic e g certain worms and arthropods or which have acquired specially modified secondary sexual organs e g lobster crayfish Lim ulus The common type is the familiar tailed form prevalent one in the groups Ccelen terata Vermes Echinoderma Mollusca Ar thropoda and Tunicata The three general divisions are usually distinct and readily recognizable Rarely the spermatozoa of all the species studied have a special struc ture or apical body at the anterior tip of the head It has been variously described as 1 an adaptation for boring into the egg 2 a remnant of the cytoplasm 3 fluid expressed from the nucleus upon 317 shrivelling 4 a micropore surrounded by  Ringkorper  5 an apical button present in the unripe spermatozoon 6 the sperm centrosome The first five opin ions seem to have little importance when considered in connection with the origin of this apical body While the opinion of myself and others that it is the sperm cen trosome is refuted by the weight of evidence that the sperm centrosome comes from the middle piece of the spermatozoon yet so far as I know the function of this apical body has not been noted by any of those who have studied so successfully the fertiliza tion process Since it has the same micro chemical reactions and the same origin as as the middle piece it would appear as if its fate must be of considerable consequence I have found this apical body in more than forty species representing all the groups from the Ccelenterates to Amphioxus in cluding Toxopneustes By others it has been found in upwards of twenty additional species The fact that the apical body is present in the spermatozoon of wellnigh every species studied indicates that it has some very special significance which should not be overlooked by workers on the phenomena of fertilization The Middle Piece of the

history of the ascidian oScyte considered from a chemical as well as from a purely morphological aspect made by means of carefully controlled aniline staining sup ported by artificial digestion and

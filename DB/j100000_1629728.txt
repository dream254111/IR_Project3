island the fauna is richer species and individuals more numerous than on the west coast in the for mer tract moreover the fauna is markedly benthonic in the latter planktonic These con tracts are referred to the action of currents While Gulf Stream water occupies the sea west and north of Spitzbergen it is intimately mixed with the cold water of the polar current on the east In this zone of mixture the steno thermic and stenohalinic organisms of the plank ton are killed and thus furnish an abundant rain of food for the bottom forms So thickly planted were the hydroids and bryozoa that at times the heavy dredge did not penetrate to the true bottom at all but came up full of these organisms A table of hydrographical obser vations appears in the narrative of the voyage REGINALD A DALY HARVARD UNIVERSITY A NEW STAR IN AQUILA FROM an examination of the Draper Memorial photographs Mrs Fleming has discovered a new star in the constellation Aquila Its posi tion for 1900 is R A 19h 15m 16s Dec   0 19 2 It was too faint to be photographed on 96 plates taken between August 21 1886 and November 1 1898 although stars as faint as the thirteenth magnitude are visible on some of them It appears on 18 photographs taken between April 21 1899 and October 27 1899 On April 21st it was of the seventh magnitude and on October 27 1899 of the tenth magni tude Two photographs taken on July 7 and July 9 1900 show that the star is still visible and that its photographic magnitude is about 115 A photograph taken on July 3 1899 shows that its spectrum resembled those of other new stars while a photograph taken on October 27 1899 shows that the spectrum re sembled those of gaseous nebulae On July 9 1900 the object was observed with the 15inch Equatorial by Professor Wendell who estimated its magnitude as 115 to 120 and confirmed the monochromatic character of its spectrum E C PICKERING HARVARD COLLEGE OBSERVATORY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A BUREAU OF CHEMISTRY THE following resolutions have been ap proved by Council of the American Chemical Society WHEREAS the laws of the several states controlling food adulterations are largely inef fective because of the interference of interstate

flour oil and sugar Dominion coal and English pemmican Maine lumber New Bedford whaleboats and Mauser rifles from Santiago and will proceed as rapidly as ice and other conditions will permit to Pearys headquarters at Etah The mail expected from the Norwegian friends of the FramSver drup expedition has not arrived and the relief promised for the Robert Stein party landed last year near Cape Sabine has entirely failed to materialize The fate of Stein and his compan ions depends upon the Windward Two volumes of the evidence before The British Indian Plague Commission have been is sued They contain a largeamountof testimony and numerous reports on preventive inocula tion and other subjects but the report of the Commissioners has not yet been issued A MEETING was held at Liverpool on June 25th under the auspices of the School of Trop ical Medicine at which the following resolutions were adopted 1 That this meeting of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and others having heard the views of the experts of the School on the conditions for Europeans of life in the tropics are strongly of opin ion that steps should be immediately taken by HIer Majestys Government to improve those conditions in every possible direction by the segregation of Euro peans improved sanitation better water supply clearance of bush near towns light railways to the mountainous districts and such other means as science may direct 2 That the Liverpool Chamber of Com merce be requested to cooperate with the School and to ask the Governmenit to receive a joint deputation on the subject Addresses on the subject were made by Pro fessor Robert Boyce Major Ronald Ross and Professor Flexner AccoRDING to a cablegram to the daily papers the first authoritative report on Count Zeppelins airship was made on July 10th at a meeting of the 119 society for the promotion of aerial navigation by experts who either shared in or watched the recent experiment They declared that im provements in the steering apparatus were nec essary the one at present used having been thrown out of gear on one side of the balloon rendering its proper guidance and return to the starting point impossible The steering rods running upward from the car were too weak and became bent The screw blades conse quently did not respond properly The air pressure motors failed but it was difficult to say whether this was caused by a defect or by bad handling The method of transmitting power to the screws will need great improve ment to enable the airship to contend against even a light wind During the recent as cent the wind had a velocity of three metres a second to a height of 100 metres and against this the vessel sailed well but at a height of from 150 to 200 metres the balloon was evidently driven before the wind It must be remembered however that this was when one of the rudders was out of gear If the speed of the screws cannot be increased the blades must be enlarged Another defect was the continual escape of gas necessitating con stant filling of the receptacle up to the moment of starting This defect alone will prevent the achievement of the idea of remaining in the air for eight consecutive days as a single filling costs 10000 Marks It is imperative for financial as well as scientific reasons that this defect be overcome The king and queen of Wiirtemburg will visit Friedrichshaven on July 12th when a second ascent will be tried in their presence On the result will depend whether the vessel shall be improved on its original lines or fundamental alterations be made The problem will certainly not be abandoned even if there is another failure Count Zeppelin is far too enthusiastic to give up his attempts Moreover large financial interests are at stake Already more than 1000000 Marks have been spent on the machine and experiments of which amount Count Zeppelin furnished about 500000 Marks THE annual general meeting of Marine Bio logical Association was held in the rooms of the Royal Society on June 27th Nature states that JULY 20 1900N S VOL XII No 289 the council reported that arrangements had been completed for the supply of seawater obtained from the open sea beyond the Plymouth Break water for special experiments on the rearing of seafishes and other marine animals Through the kindness of Mr J W Woodall the Associa tion has had placed at its disposal a small float ing laboratory which is at present stationed at Salcombe The periodical surveys of the phys ical and biological conditions prevailing at the mouth of the English Channel have been con tinued by Mr Garstang at quarterly intervals for an entire year Observations were taken at four fixed stations They included serial tem perature determinations at all depths filtration of a definite column of water from bottom to surface with a vertical net and collections of the floating life at surface midwater and bottom by means of a special devised closing net Mr Garstang has also carried out a series of pre liminary experiments on the rearing of sea fish larvae under different conditions with a view to a solution of the difficulties hitherto encountered in regard to the practical work of seafish culture UNIVERSITY AND EDUCATIONAL NEWS FOR the eighth time we believe the courts have decided the Fayerweather will case in favor of the colleges It is said that the case will still be carried to the Supreme Court of the United States As the amount still in volved is about 3000000 it is to be hoped that no legal technicality will prevent the money from being used as Mr Fayerweather intended and that it will not be diverted to the distant heirs and the lawyers who are trying to get it A FELLOWSHIP in Greek has been endowed at Columbia University to be open to graduate students in Barnard College The name of the donor is not made public The fellowship will carry with it an annual stipend for the holder of 500 THE foundationstone of the Passmore Ed wards Hall of the University of London

The hall will furnish the home of the Faculty of Economics and Political Science in cluding commerce and industry established by the University Commissioners and in it will be cartied on the future work of the London School of Economics and Political Science which is practically coextensive with the new Faculty and which has been admitted as a school of the University Toward the expense of carrying on the work the London County Council will contribute 2500 a year and Mr Passmore Edwards has vested the sum of 10000 in three trustees for the erection of the building and for carrying on

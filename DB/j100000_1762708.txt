experiments described in which that philosopher attempted to show that some relation must exist between natural phenomena which had been considered as having no connection with one another He tried to prove that gravitation could pro duce magnetic or electrical effects and although he failed yet at 1 2  7a   FIG I FIG 2 the end of the research he expressed his belief that some connec tion existed and would some day be discovered But he did find that a magnetic field had an effect upon polarized light passing through it and this discovery has been developed until Maxwell advanced the hypothesis that electrical vibrations may be propa gated through space according to the same laws that govern the propagation of light and with the same velocity ancl now the theory of Maxwell has been experimentally verified by Hertz The evidence in favor of Maxwells theory before Hertz published his work lay principally in the facts that the equations of propagation of an electromagnetic disturbance were practically those which have been deduced for light and which have explained a number of the phenomena that take place The velocity of such a disturb ance is equal to a constant which can be determined electrically and which agrees very well with the observed velocity of light while a relation between the specific inductive capacity determined electrically and the index of refraction of a substance agrees fairly well with that deduced from Maxwells theory Hertz has added to this evidence a proof indirect but fairly conclusive that the  electrical displacements  in a dielectric on which rests much of Maxwells theory really exist that actual electromag netic waves are reflected and interfere with one another and that the velocity of such waves is about what is calculatedl We will describe Hertzs experiments as clearly and briefly as possible re ferring those who desire a detailed description to Hertzs and De Funzelmanns papers In the first place it was necessary to produce electrical oscilla tions of a very small period Roughly the period of a lightwave is Io  15 of a second and we know of no way of producing electrical oscillations on a conductor of finite size of any thing near so rapid a period When Hertz took the matter up the most rapid oscilla tions that hacl been experimented upon were those caused by the discharge of a Leyden jar through a resistance the period being about io 6 of a second Theoretically a much shorter period would be obtained with conductingwires forming an open circuit the ends having small knobs on them and this is the form Hertz first experimented on his object being to discover whether measur able oscillations were really produced The period in this case should be some hundred millionths of a second  10  8 as com pared with 10  5 for light The general arrangement of the ap paratus is shown in Fig I Here Ais a large inductioncoil with the wires B fastened to the terminals of the secondary circuit The 1 Hertzs original papers are in Wiedemanns Annalen I888 Mr G W de Funzel mann has given an excellent resumeiof Hertzs work in the London Electrician Nos 539 545i 547i 548 79 coil Hertz used was a large one 52 centimetres long by 20 centi metres in diameter and it was run by six large Bunsen cells When the coil is working there are sparks between the knobs B and when one of these sparks passes we have the case of the discharge of conductingwires forming an open circuit and this will cause rapid oscillations along the wires which will diminish in amplitude until they are reenforced by another discharge To observe these disturbances Hertz arranged a circuit shown in Fig I at M This was simply an open circuit of wire with two adjustable knobs I and 2 On connecting this micrometer circuit to one of the wires B the connection being as shown in Fig I sparks sometimes several millimetres long passed between I and 2 The reason of this is that the rapid and violent oscillations on B are transmitted to the knob i sometimes causing a high and sometimes a low potential at that point Now if it takes a finite time for this disturbance to travel around the circuit M then there will be for a short time a considerable difference of potential be tween I and 2 and this causes the spark With the connection to M made as in Fig 2 the distances of e from I and 2 being equal then the disturbance reaches these points at the same moment and there is no difference of potential between them and therefore no spark This is what Hertz actually finds Some of the facts that Hertz obtained were these In the first place the effect in the micrometer circuit depends on the shape of the terminals B and on the nature of the spark the material and size of the wire of the micrometer circuit has very little influ ence on the spark If when the contact is at e Fig 2 a con ductor be joined to one of the knobs i or 2 then the spark reap pears This last Hertz thinks shows that the phenomenon cannot be due to single waves in the directions ca and db respectively but must be due to a series of oscillations set up in the micrometer circuit and the adlition of a conductor to one of the knobs changes the period of vibration of that branch the periods being determined by the product of the coefficients of selfinduction into the capacities of the branches The fact that the material of which the circuit is made has no effect on the spark tends to show the same thing namely that the phenomena in the micrometer circuit are dependent upon selfinductions and capacities that is upon timeconstants AH 7 C d a M a  h h OQx D FIG 3 To further prove the oscillatory character of the discharge Hertz used the arrangement of Fig 3 Here the micrometer circuit was placed with one of its sides parallel to the wire igh which was connected to one of the discharge wires B The sparks at M were very feeble until a conductor C was attached to the free endA  of the wire when they increased to two millimetres No effect was produced when C was attached atg When the knobs at B were so far apart that no sparking took place the sparks at M also dis appeared which showed that they were due to the sudden dis charges not to the charging current While C was attached to h FEBRUARY I I889SCIENCE VOL XIII and the knobs at M drawn so far apart that the sparks only passed singly then if a similar conductor C be brought up to k a stream of sparks was immediately observed This action of C could only be explained by supposing the current in gh was oscillatory The reason that a powerful inductioncoil gives rise to oscillatory motion is that first it charges the terminals C and C to a high potential second it produces a spark in the intervening circuit and third as soon as the discharge begins the resistance of the airspace is so much reduced as to allow of oscillatory motion being set up If the terminal conductors are of very large capacity for example if the terminals are in connection with a battery the cur rent of discharge may indefinitely reduce the resistance of the air space but when the terminal conductors are of small capacity this must be done by a separate discharge and therefore under the conditions of Hertzs experiments an inductioncoil was absolutely essential for the production of oscillations Hertz slightly modified the form of apparatus used to that shown in Fig 4 where the conductors C and C were in the same straight line three metres apart with the discharger B at the centre With this arrangement sparks were obtained in the micrometer circuit when its distance from CBC was one and a half metres Hertz replaced the micrometer circuit shown in Fig 4 by another which FIG 4 FIG 4 consisted of two wires parallel with CBC with knobs at their ends there being a micrometer M at the middle Sparks were obtained at the micrometer as with the other form of circuit When the knobs at B were drawn so far apart that there was no spark between them there was still a spark at M due to the elec trostatic effect of charging C and C By bridging across M with a damp thread this effect was got rid of but when there were sparks at B there were sparks at zV even with the thread So the thread was sufficient to afford a passage to the comparatively slow alternations of the coildischarge but was not sufficient to provide a passage for the immeasurably more rapid alternations of the os cillatory current If there really are oscillations of the nature of a regular vibration then an oscillatory current of a definite period would exert a much greater inductive effect upon one of equal period than upon one differing from it that is we ought to get resonance phenomena from currents as from soundvibrations If two circuits are taken having as nearly as possible equal periods of vibration the effect of one on the other will be diminished by altering either the capacity or coefficient of selfinduction of one of them as a change in either of these would alter the period of vibration of the circuit To be continued ANOTHER ELECTRIC ROAD AT ATLANTIC CITY NJ We take great pleasure in announcing in this issue of our paper a most important indorsement of the electric system of streetrailway pro pulsion This indorsement comes from the Pennsylvania Railway Company who have during this last week through the general managers of that company closed a most important contract with the Sprague Electric Railway and Motor Company for the complete equipment of their system of electric streetrailways at Atlantic City NJ Before awarding this contract for the equipment of this road the Pennsylvania Railroad appointed a committee who should have charge of making a most minute and careful investigation of the merits of all the different systems of streetrailway propulsion both electric and cable now in use The committee in charge of the investigation were composed of mechanical and electrical ex perts of the highest class and of wide reputation The period of investigation extended over five months and during this time the committee visited all the principal electric railways and cable roads which are in operation in this country and carefully examined the operation of each The Sprague Company are certainly to be con gratulated upon securing this contract WEST END ELECTRIC ROAD AT BOSTON  The West End Elec tric Railway at Boston is running very successfully and carrying a large number of passengers each day between Park Square one terminus of the road and Brighton the other terminus of the road The cars run fast and are under quick and perfect control The residents in Brookline who use the cars regularly in coming into Boston and returning are enthusiastic over the time saved over the ordinary horsecar The change of the overhead to the under ground system is made very quickly and without stop so that no delay is experienced at this point The cardrivers or is motorneers as some Bostonians persist in calling them are not expert electri cians but simply streetcar drivers who have been detailed to oper ate the electric cars and who have learned their necessary duties very quickly All of these old drivers are enthusiastic over the ease with which an electric car can be driven and are well pleased with their new position On the 20th of January a very heavy snow storm reached the city and covered the tracks of the railway to the depth of from two inches to a foot The electric snowploughs which are being equipped by the Sprague Company for use by the West End Road had not been finished and the cars were obliged to run without this aid for clearing the tracks In spite of this the cars ran very successfully over the entire distance of the roads clear ing their own way and carrying large numbers of passengers The president of the road and the directors expressed themselves as well pleased with the demonstrated efficiency and strength of the electric road as exhibited during the snowstorm even without the aid of the regular Sprague electric snowploughs The Boston Herald in an editorial of Jan I7 in commenting on the road said  Those who have made the experiment of taking a ride on the new electric rail way on Beacon Street must have come to the conclusion that this method of securing rapid transit in the suburban wards is one of the most promising that has yet been brought forward in this city The speed attained where the conditions are favorable is quite equal to that of the elevated railroads in New York City while the structures supporting the electric wires are by no means as much of a disfigurement as it was at one time supposed that they might be So long as a mixed service is maintained that is so long as some of the cars are drawn by horses  the full advantage of the elec tric system cannot be realized The speed of the electric car has to conform to the speed of the horsecar which may be in front of it but if the experiment proves as successful as there is now every reason to think that it may the West End Company will before long feel compelled to substitute electric for animal power in the service of all of its lines When that change is brought about the speed that can be made even in the centre of the city will be very much accelerated over the average speed of today A SOUTHERN ELECTRIC RAILWAY STARTED Dinring the past week the Asheville Electric Street Railway which has been in course of construction for the last month under the Sprague Elec tric Railway and Motor Company of New York was successfully put in operation The first trial trip of the motorcars was made on Jan 21 in presence of the president Mr W P Penniman jun superintendent Mr J H Barnard and a number of prominent citi zens  Capt T W Patton Gen Jonstone Jones Dr S D Pelham and about sixty others some being stockholders in the road and others interested directly or indirectly in the success of the enter prise The test proved a great success The run was made over the entire distance of the line about two miles in less than eight minutes carrying a large number of passengers The citizens of Asheville are enthusiastic over the new electric line and the direc 8o0 No 313FEBRUARY I I889 SCIE tors of the road express themselves as very well pleased with the successful performance of the motorcars A NEW SYSTEM OF ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION  One of the problems which has claimed the attention of inventors in the past few years has been the conversion of hightension to low tension electric currents The object is to distribute electric energy at a high potential using comparatively small wires and at the points of consumption to reduce the potential to that de manded by safety and the requirements of incandescent lighting A large part of the cost of an incandescent electric plant is in the wires used for distribution and the size of the wire required to distribute a given amount of energy varies inversely as the poten tial used One of the most successful converter systems is that THE DICKERSON SYSTEMOFELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION used by the Westinghouse Company where alternating currents are employed and the reduction is effected by transformers  in ductioncoils working backward But there are some disadvantages in the use of alternating currents and many attempts have been made to invent a continuouscurrent converter that will do for continuous what the transformer does for alternating currents Storagebatteries would offer an ideal method of effecting this but for their cost and depreciation Several mechanical methods have been tried among others a motorgenerator arrangement  a com bined motor and dynamo the former supplied from the highpo tential circuit the latter supplying current at a low potential to the local circuit Other plans have been proposed in which the main circuit is interrupted and advantage is taken of its inductive effect on the secondary circuit None of these systems however are in successful operation on a large scale Mr Edward N Dick erson jun of this city received last week Jan 22 a patent on an improvement in his method of converting hightension into lowtension currents  Feb I4 i888 a patent was granted Mr Dickerson for a method of converting a direct hightension cur NCE 8I rent into an alternating lowtension current and by his recent im provement he is able to obtain a continuous lowtension current Which is a considerable advantage if the resulting current is to be used for a motor or for electric plating The accompanying figures will make it clear how this result is obtained A hightension cur rent flows out upon the circuit a and returns to the generator by the circuit k By the switch L it passes through the motor C On the shaft of this motor is arranged the double reversingcommu tator BB the sections of which are alternately connected with the circuit d and with the circuit g The current upon the circuits ef is a hightension reversing current and operates the converter D which converts the reversing hightension current into a reversing lowtension current This induced alternating current passes to the reversingcommutatorJf by which the reversing currents are rectified It is of course essential that the two commutators shall move synchronously and the commutator JK should be so adjusted on the shaft as to allow for the time required by the converter The switch EF may be omitted  but by it it is possible to throw any house into circuit from the central office THE WESTINGHOUSE AND UNITED STATES COMPANIES An agreement is reported between these companies whereby their interests are united The United States Company is one of the oldest electrical manufacturing companies and has a large factory in Newark NJ The Westinghouse Company was already the lessee of the Consolidated and SawyerMan Electric Companies of New York and the owner of the Waterhouse Electric Company of Hartford Conn and the Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing Company of Rahway NJ The new combination has a manu facturing capacity of over I5ooo lamps a day and the two com panies own and control about 700 patents in every branch of electrical invention NOTES AND NEWS IT is announced that a postgraduate department in electrical en gineering will soon be established by the trustees of Columbia Col lege this city A beginning will be made upon an economical scale and the facilities will be increased in proportion to the pat ronage which it is believed will increase rapidly as New York is a city in or near which all or nearly all of the many applications of elec trical science may be studied in practical operation The course will be open to graduates of all scientific schools  An electrical exhibition will be held in the Chicago Exposition Building in connection with the National Electric Light Association Convention on Feb 19 20 and 21 Many exhibiters have already secured space the electric railway companies being especially fore handed in that respect The exhibition though not intended to be of long duration promises to be interesting and important  The Journal of the Society of Arts reports the discovery of a new textile on the shores of the Caspian This plant called  kanaff  by the natives grows in the summer and attains a height of ten feet with a diameter varying from two to three centimetres By careful cultivation and technical manipulation M 0 Blakenbourg a chemist and engineer who has made a special study of kanaff has obtained an admirable textile matter It is soft elastic and silky gives a thread which is very tough and can be chemically bleached without losing its value The stuffs manufactured out of kanaff and then bleached can be successfully dyed in every shade of color and would compete with any of the ordinary furnishing materials now in use But it is particularly for making sacks tar paulin ropes etc that this new textile from its cheapness and its extraordinary resisting power might defy all competition Its spe cific weight is much less but its resistance much greater than those of hemp Thus a cord of 825 millimetres diameter woven with the hand out of three threads of kanaff requires a weight of I80 kilograms to break it A cord half an inch thick manufactured at Moscow did not break till the weight of 625 kilograms was reached When it is considered that Russia annually consumes more than one hundred and fifty millions of sacks a third of which are imported it may be easily seen that the appearance of this new textile on the Russian market is an event of no slight importance

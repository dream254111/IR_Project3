HYPOTHESIS,I206866,CONSIDERATIONS AND ENQUIRIES CONCERNING TIDES BY SIR ROBERT MORAY LIKEWISE FOR A FURTHER SEARCH INTO DR WALLISS NEWLY PUBLISHT HYPOTHESIS IN REGARD THAT THE HIGH AND LOW WATERS ARE OBSERVED TO INCREASE AND DECREASE REGULARLY AT SEVERAL SEASONS ACCORDING TO THE MOONS AGE SO AS ABOUT THE NEW AND FULL MOON OR WITHIN TWO OR THREE DAIES AFTER IN THE WESTERN PARTS OF EUROPE THE TIDES ARE AT THE HIGHEST AND ABOUT THE QUARTER MOONS AT THE LOWEST THE FORMER CALLD SPRINGTIDES THE OTHER NEAPTIDES AND THAT ACCORDING TO THE HEIGHT AND EXCESSES OF THE TIDES THE EBBES IN OPPO SITION ARE ANSWERABLE TO THEM THE HEIGHEST TIDE HAVING THE LOWEST EBBE AND THE LOWEST EBBE THE HIGHEST TIDE THE TIDES FROM THE QUARTER TO THE HIGHEST SPRINGTIDE INCREASING IN A CERTAIN PROPORTION AND FROM THE SPRINGTIDE TO THE QUARTERTIDE DECREASING IN LIKE PROPORTION AS IS SUPPOSED AND ALSO THE EBBES RISING AND FALLING CONSTANTLY AFTER THE SAME MANNER IT IS WISHED THAT IT MAY BE INQUIRED IN WHAT PROPORTION THESE INCREASES AND DECREASES RI SINGS AND FALLINGS HAPPEN TO BE IN REGARD OF ONE ANOTHER AND TIS SUPPOSED UPON SOME OBSERVATIONS MADE IN FIT PLACES BY THE ABOVEMENTIONED GENTLEMAN THOUGH AS HIMSELF ACKNOWLEDGES NOT THO ROUGHLY AND EXACTLY PERFORMED THAT THE INCREASE OF THE TIDES IS MADE IN THE PROPORTION OF SINES THE FIRST INCREASE EXCEEDING THE LOWEST IN A SMALL PROPOR TION THE NEXT IN A GREATER THE THIRD GREATER THAN THAT AND SO ON TO THE MIDMOST WHEREOF THE EXCESS IS GREATEST DIMINISHING AGAIN FROM THAT TO THE HIGHEST SPRINGTIDE SO AS THE PROPORTIONS BEFORE AND AFTER THE MIDDLE DO GREATLY ANSWER ONE ANOTHER OR SEEM TO DO SO AND LIKEWISE FROM THE HIGHEST SPRINGTIDE TO THE LOWEST NEAPTIDE THE DECREASES SEEM TO KEEP THE LIKE PRO PORTIONS THE EBBES RISING AND FALLING IN LIKE MANNER AND IN LIKE PROPOR TIONS ALL WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO FALL OUT WHEN NO WIND OR OTHER ACCIDENT CAUSES AN ALTERATION AND299 AND WHEREAS TIS OBSERVED THAT UPON THE MAIN SEASHORE THE CURRENT OF THE EBBINGS AND FLOWINGS IS SOMETIMES SWIFTER AND SOMETIMES SLACKER THAN AT OTHERS SO AS IN THE BEGINNING OF THE FLOUD THE TIDE MOVES FASTER BUT IN A SMALL DEGREE INCREASING ITS SWIFTNESS CONSTANTLY TILL TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOUD AND THEN DECREASING IN VELOCITY AGAIN FROM THE MIDDLE TILL TO THE TOP OF THE HIGHWATER IT IS SUPPOSED THAT IN EQUAL SPACES OF TIME THE INCREASE AND DECREASE OF VELOCITY AND CONSEQUENTLY THE DEGREES OF THE RISINGS AND FALLINGS OF THE SAME IN EQUAL SPACES OF TIME ARE PERFORMED ACCORDING TO THE PROPORTION OF SINES BUT TIS WITHALL CONCEIVED THAT THE SAID PROPORTION CANNOT HOLD EXACTLY AND PRECISELY IN REGARD OF THE INEQUALITIES THAT FALL OUT IN THE PERIODS OF THE TIDES WHICH ARE COMMONLY OBSERVED AND BELIEVED TO FOLLOW CERTAIN POSITIONS OF THE MOON IN REGARD OF THE EQUINOX WHICH ARE KNOWN NOT TO KEEP A PRECISE AND CONSTANT COURSE SO THAT THERE NOT INTERVENING EQUAL PORTIONS OF TIME BE TWEEN ONE NEW MOON AND ANOTHER THE MOONS RETURN TO THE SAME MERIDIAN CANNOT BE ALWAIES PERFORMD IN THE SAME TIME AND CONSEQUENTLY THERE MUST BE A LIKE VARIATION OF THE TIDES IN THE VELOCITY AND IN THE RISINGS AND FAL LINGS OF THE TIDES AS TO EQUAL SPACES OF TIME AND THE TIDES FROM NEW MOON TO NEWMOON BEING NOT ALWAIES THE SAME IN NUMBER AS SOMETIMES BUT 57 SOMETIMES 58 AND SOMETIMES 59 WITHOUT ANY CERTAIN ORDER OF SUCCES SION IS ANOTHER EVIDENCE OF THE DIFFICULTY OF REDUCING THIS TO ANY GREAT EX ACTNESS YET BECAUSE TIS WORTH WHILE TO LEARN AS MUCH OF IT AS MAY BE THE PROPOSER AND MANY OTHERS DO DESIRE THAT OBSERVATIONS BE CONSTANTLY MADE OF ALL THESE PARTICULARS FOR SOME MONTHS AND IF IT MAY BE YEARS TOGETHER AND BECAUSE SUCH OBSERVATIONS WILL BE THE MORE EASILY AND EXACTLY MADE WHERE THE TIDES RISE HIGHEST IT IS PRESUMED THAT A FIT APPARATUS BEING MADE FOR THE PURPOSE THEY MAY BE MADE ABOUT BRISTOL OR CHEAPSTOW BEST OF ANY PLACES IN ENGLAND BECAUSE THE TIDES ARE SAID THEREABOUT TO RISE TO TEN OR TWELVE FATHOMS AS UPON THE COAST OF BRITANNY IN FRANCE THEY DO TO THIRTEEN AND FOURTEEN IN ORDER TO WHICH THIS FOLLOWING APPARATUS IS PROPOSED TO BE MADE USE OF IN SOME CONVENIENT PLACE UPON A WALL ROCK OR BRIDGE C LET THERE BE AN OBSERVATORY STANDING AS NEER AS MAY BE TO THE BRINK OF THE SEA OR UPON SOME WALL AND IF IT CANNOT BE WELL PLACED JUST WHERE THE LOW WATER IS THERE MAY BE A CHANNEL CUT FROM THE LOW WATER TO THE BOTTOM OF THE WALL ROCK C THE OBSERVATORY IS TO BE RAISED ABOVE THE HIGHWATER 18 OR 20 FOOT AND A PUMP OF ANY REASONABLE DIMENSION PLACED PERPENDICULARLY BY THE WALL REACHING ABOVE THE HIGH WATER AS HIGH AS CONVENIENTLY MAY BE UPON THE TOP OF THE PUMP A PULLEY IS TO BE FASTNED FOR LETTING DOWN INTO THE PUMP A PIECE OF FLOATING WOOD WHICH AS THE WATER COMES IN MAY RISE AND FALL WITH IT AND BECAUSE THE RISING AND FALLING OF THE WATER AMOUNTS TO 60 OR 70 FOOT THE COUNTERPOISE OF THE WEIGHT THAT GOES INTO THE PUMP IS TO HANG UPON AS MANY PULLEYS AS MAYSERVE TO MAKE IT RISE  FALL WITHIN THE SPACE BY WHICH THE HEIGHT OF THE PUMP EXCEEDS THE HEIGHT OF THE WATER AND BECAUSE BY THIS300 THIS MEANS THE COUNTERPOISE WILL RISE AND FALL SLOWER AND CONSEQUENTLY BY LESS PROPORTIONS THAN THE WEIGHT IT SELF THE FIRST PULLEY MAY HAVE UPON IT A WHEELE OR TWO TO TURN INDEXES AT ANY PROPORTION REQUIRED SO AS TO GIVE THE MINUTE PARTS OF THE MOTION AND DEGREES OF RISINGS AND FALLINGS ALL WHICH IS TO BE OBSERVED BY PENDULUMWATCHES THAT HAVE MINUTES AND SECONDS WITH CHEEKS ACCORDING TO MR HUGONSS WAY AND BECAUSE IF THE HOLE BY WHICH THE WATER IS LET INTO THE PUMP BE AS LARGE AS THE BORE OF THE PUMP IT SELF THE WEIGHT THAT IS RAISED BY THE WATER WILL RISE AND FALL WITH AN UNDOLALATION ACCORDING TO THE INEQUALITY OF THE SEAS SURFACE TWILL THEREFORE BE FIT THAT THE HOLE BY WHICH THE WATER EN TERS BE LESS THAN HALF AS BIGG AS THE BORE OF THE PUMP ANY INCONVENIENCE THAT MAY FOLLOW THEREUPON AS TO THE PERIODS AND STATIONS OF THE FLOUD AND EBB NOT BEING CONSIDERABLE AND TO THE END THAT IT MAY APPEAR THE BETTER WHAT ARE THE PARTICULAR OB SERVATIONS DESIRED TO BE MADE NEAR BRISTOL OR CHEAPSTOW BRIDG IT WAS THOUGHT NOT AMISS TO SET THEM DOWN DISTINCTLY BY THEMSELVES 1 THE DEGREES OF THE RISING AND FALLING OF THE WATER EVERY QUARTER OF AN HOUR OR AS OFTEN AS CONVENIENTLY MAY BE FROM THE PERIODS OF THE TIDES AND EBBS TO BE OBSERVED NIGHT AND DAY FOR 2 OR 3 MONTHS 2 THE DEGREES OF THE VELOCITY OF THE MOTION OF THE WATER EVERY QUARTER OF AN HOUR FOR SOME WHOLE TIDES TOGETHER TO BE OBSERVED BY A SECOND PEXDULWATCH AND A LOGG FASTENED TO A LINE OF SOME 50 FATHOMS WOUND ABOUT A WHEEL 3 THE EXACT MEASURES OF THE HEIGHTS OF EVERY UTMOST HIGHWATER AND LOWWATER FROM ONE SPRINGTIDE TO ANOTHER FOR SOME MONTHS OR RATHER YEARS 4 THE EXACT HEIGHTS OF SPRINGTIDES AND SPRINGEBBS FOR SOME YEARS TO GETHER 5 THE POSITION OF THE WIND AT EVERY OBSERVATION OF THE TIDES AND THE TIMES OF ITS CHANGES AND THE DEGREES OF ITS STRENGTH 6 THE STATE OF THE WEATHER AS TO RAIN HAIL MIST HAZINESS C AND THE TIMES OF ITS CHANGES 7 AT THE TIMES OF OBSERVATION OF THE TIDES THE HEIGHT OF THE THERMO METER THE HEIGHT OF THE BAROSCOPE THE HEIGHT OF THE HYGROSCOPE THE AGE OF THE MOON AND HER AZIMUTHS AND HER PLACE IN ALL RESPECTS AND LASTLY THE SUNS PLACE ALL THESE TO MINUTES AND IT WOULD BE CONVENIENT TO KEEP JOURNAL TABLES FOR ALL THESE OBSER VATIONS EACH ANSWERING TO ITS DAY OF THE MONTH FOR THE APPARATUS OF ALL THESE OBSERVATIONS THERE WILL BE PARTICULARLY NE CESSARY A GOOD PENDULUMWATCH A VANE SHEWING AZIMUTHS TO MINUTE PARTS AN INSTRUMENT TO MEASURE THE STRENGTH OF THE WINDE A LARGE AND GOOD NEEDLE SHEWING AZIMUTHS TO DEGREES THER301 THERMOMETERS BAROMETERS HYGROSCOPES THESE OBSERVATIONS BEING THOUGHT VERY CONSIDERABLE AS WELL AS CURIOUS TIS HOPED THAT THOSE WHO HAVE CONVENIENCY WILL GIVE ENCOURAGEMENT AND ASSI STANCE FOR THE MAKING OF THEM AND WITHALL OBLIGE THE PUBLICK BY IMPARTING WL AT THEY SHALL HAVE OBSERVED OF THIS KIND THE PUBLISHER INTENDING THAT WHEN EVER SUCH OBSERVATIONS SHALL BE COMMUNICATED TO HIM HE WILL GIVE NO TICE OF IT TO THE PUBLICK AND TAKE CARE OF THE IMPROVEMENT THEREOF TO THE BEST USE AND ADVANTAGE A PATTERN OF THE TABLE PROPOSED TO BE MADE FOR OBSERVING THE TIDES IS INTENDED TO BE PUBLISHED THE NEXT OPPORTUNITY GOD PERMITTING

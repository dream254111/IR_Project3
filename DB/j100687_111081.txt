j100687,Abstracts of the Papers Communicated to the Royal Society of London,111081,On the Temperature of Steam and Its Corresponding Pressure Abstract,i207047,941 The paper contains an analysis of these salts The mosses and lichens were also found to yield fucusol The ferns on the other hand yield a peculiar oil which differs both from fucusol and firfurol possessing properties intermediate between them The results of these experiments seem to indicate some curious botanical relations as it appears highly probable that the matiere incrustante is the same in all phanerogamous plants as they yield furfurol On the other hand the matiere incrustante in the Alge mosses and lichens as it yields fucusol and not furfurol though the same in each of these classes is evidently different from that of pha nerogamous plants The matiere incrustante of ferns appears how ever to be dissimilar from either of the others as it yields an analo gous but peculiar oil April 25 1850 The EARL OF ROSSE President in the Chair M Quetelet was admitted into the Society The following papers were read 1 On the Temperature of Steam and its corresponding Pressure By John Curr Esq Communicated by J Scott Iussell Esq FRS The author states that it is intended in this paper to propose a simple law to determine the pressure of steam corresponding to any given temperature irrespectively of experiment taking as the sole datum that the vaporizing point of water under a given pressure is 100 degrees that number being taken to correspond with the scale of Celsius also to construct formula in accordance therewith and afterwards to compare their resultswith the actual experiments of the Academy of Sciences of Paris He further states that the rationale of the subsequent formule is expressed as follows Let it be con ceived that a given quantity of water is vaporized under the condition that the pressure thereon is increased in the sarne ratio that the vo lume is increased or that at intervals of temperature 1 2 S c the volume is increased the same or in equal proportions the tempe rature of the volume will be increased exactly as the square of the temperature indicated by the thermometer supposing the instrument to be a true measure of temperature and as the square of the vo lume and the same of the pressure Steam being generated from an indefinite quantity of water and confined within a limited space as in the usual boiler he considers the foregoing case is reversed for the volume being constant the action of the fire is entirely exerted in producing increased elastic tension of the vapour therefore the temperature of the steam at the interval 1 to 2 degrees is increased inversely in the duplicate ratio of the ratio in the case first described that is the pressure is in creased directly at the square of the square or fourth power of the942 temperature whence the following law The pressure of steam generated in the usual steamboiler is directly proportional to the fourth power of its temperature when measured by a true scale It being assumed that 100 degrees is the tenmperature of steam when its pressure is in equilibrium with a column of 30 inches of mercury or with the pressure of one atmosphere then F being the pressure in atmospheres t any temtperature t A conmparison is instituted between theoretic experiments of the Academy of Sciences and the results of this forimula from whlich it appears that the temperatures deduced from the formula are inva riably in defect the greatest difference being S51 and the least 202 2  On the means adopted in the British Colonial iMagncetic Ob servatories for determining the absolute values secular change and annual variation of the Magnetic Force By LieutCol Edward Sabine RA For See RS The determination of the mean nulerical values of the elements of terrestrial magnetism in direction and foree at different points of the earths surface the force being expressed in absolute measure intelligible consequently to future generations however distant and conveying to them a knowledge of the present magnetic state of the globe and the determination of the nature and amount of the se calar changes which the elements are at present undergoing are as the author states the first steps in that great inductive inquiry by which it may be hoped that the inhabitants of the globe may at some date perhaps not very distant obtain a complete knowledge of the laws of the phenomena of terrestrial magnetism and possibly gain an insight into the physical causes of one of te most remnarkable forces by which our planet is affected After stating the inadequacy of the instruments originally pro posed by the Royal Society to the attainment of all the objects for which they had been designed the authlor refers to the modifications which had been introduced in the instruments and methods of ob servation for the determination of the absolute values and the secu lar changes of the horizontal component of the magnetic force He then gives the series of the results of the monthly observations at oronto from January 1845 to April 1849 as relatively correct and from this series regarding each monthly determination as entitled to equal weight and taking the arithmetical mean of all the values as the most probable lean value obtains 353043 as the mean value of the horizontal force at Toronto with a probable error of Q00055 and the probable error of  00I0 for each mronthly determination This is on the most simple hypothesis in which neither secular change nor annual variation is supposed to exist The monthly re sults however distinctly indicate a secular change and by means of them on the hypothesis of a uniforn secular change the author

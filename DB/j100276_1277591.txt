1898 32 App Div 465 53 N Y Supp Io33 it was held that the dictation of a libellous letter by the manager of a corporation to a stenographer an employee of the corporation who copied and mailed the same did not constitute publication by the corporation The court said There was in fact but one act by the corporation and those engaged in the performance of it are not to be regarded as third parties but as common servants engaged in the act In Central of Georgia Ry Co v Jones 1916 i8 Ga App 414 89 S E 429 in CartwrightCaps Co v Fischel  Kaufman I917 II3 Miss 359 74 So 278 and in Prins v HollandNorth America Mortgage Co 1919 I07 Wash 206 I8I Pac 680 the same rule was fol lowed In Morgan v Wallis 1917 K B Div 33 T L R 495 commented upon in 17 MICH L REv 187 it was held that there was not such a publica tion on the part of a private individual by the dictation to his typist as creates a liability for libel Obviously where the court holds there is no publication the question of privilege does not arise A number of courts however hold that in such cases there is publication In Pullman v Hill 1891 I Q B 524 C A it was held that the dictation of a libel by an officer of a mercantile company to a stenographer employed by it and its delivery to an office boy to have press copies made amounted to publications that the publications were not conditionally privileged and hence were actionable The court held there was no conditional privilege because as it said the defendant clearly had no duty to make the communication to the stenographer nor had the latter any interest in the matter The case was followed in Gambrill v Schooley 1901 93 Md 48 where a private individual made the dictation to his confidential stenographer and similarly in Ferdon v Dickens 1909 161 Ala I81 49 So 888 In Boxsius v Goblet Freres 1894 I Q B 842 it was held that the dictation of a libellous letter by a solicitor to his stenographer in the interest of a clients business was a publication but that it being in performance of the solicitors duty to his client was privileged on the part of the solicitor and that this privilege covered the ordinary method of performing his duties in cluding dictation of his letters to his stenographers In Edmondson v Birch  Co Ltd 1907 I K B 371 the court said that where as between two business firms a communication of libellous matter was conditionally priv ileged that privilege covered all the reasonable means of exercising it and those reasonable means might include the introduction of third persons Where the communication is conditionally privileged between the principal parties this doctrine in view of modern business methods seems most reason able Where as in the principal case the communication is direct to the plaintiff and does not involve the question of privilege as between the sender and receiver the basis of the decision in the principal case recommends itself i e where the communication is made to those who in the natural course of their employment have a duty to perform with regard to it the communica tion is conditionally privileged and in the absence of malice is not actionable LIBL AND SLANDER SLANDER oF TITLEOne Jass owned a farm and gave a mortgage on it to defendant which since Mrs Jass was away and I07MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW could not execute it was not recorded Subsequently Jass conveyed to plain tiff by warranty deed presumably giving plaintiff no notice of the mortgage Defendant hearing of conveyance recorded the mortgage without Mrs Jass signature to secure any interest he might still have Plaintiffs prospective purchaser refused to purchase and plaintiff brings action for slander of title Held defendant was not liable Kelly  First State Bank v Rothsay Minn 1920 177 N W 347 Where the plaintiff possesses an estate in property an action lies against one who maliciously and falsely denies or impugns plaintiffs title if any damage is thereby suffered by plaintiff Dodge v Colby io8 N Y 445 Lin ville v Rhoades 73 Mo App 217 ODGERS LIBEL AND SLANDER 5th Ed p 79 NEWELL SLANDER AND LIBEL 3rd Ed p 254 see Ann Cas I913C 1360 The gist of the action is the damage to the plaintiff Kendall v Stone 5 N Y I4 Felt v Germania Life Ins Co I33 N Y S 519 An interesting speculation arises where a conveyor of land whose first grantee fails to record proceeds to convey to a second grantee who records in those states where the first grantee recording without notice has priority as to whether the first grantee could sue his grantor for slander of title One advantage of this remedy is in the possibility of exemplary damages Hopkins v Drowne 21 R I 20 Malice is essential to the maintenance of the action Walkley v Bostwick 49 Mich 374 but intermeddling with the property of others with which one is not concerned is deemed malice ODGERS LIBEL AND SLANDER 5th Ed p 80 The plaintiff must have title Edwards v Burris 60 Cal 157 but in the situation just suggested the plaintiff had title at the time the second conveyance was made and by the familiar rule of estoppel the defendant is estopped from denying present title in the plaintiff his grantee The action of slander of title has been maintained where defendant advertised and sold under a false mortgage Gare v Condon 87 Md 368 where defendant fraud ulently recorded a deed to himself Smith v Autry 169 Pac 623 where de fendant filed a claim against the land Collins v Whitehead 34 Fed I21 where defendant a subsequent grantee recorded subsequently to plaintiff the prior grantee in Louisiana where the peculiar action of slander to try title lies Atchafalaya Land Co Ltd v BrownellDrews Lumber Co Ltd 130 La 657 Generally the plaintiff must show that the slander prevented an actual sale see Lindon v Graham 8 N Y Super Ct 670 Felt v Germania Life Ins Co supra But it would seem that the purpose of this requirement is to show the special damage and in our hypothetical situation where the plaintiff has lost all of his property he should have the remedy as well as one whose property has simply not brought as high a price as it might have MASTER AND SERVANTSCOPE OF EMPLOYMENTEMPLOYERS LIABILITY TO THIRD PERSoNSThe plaintiff a minor child while riding upon defendants truck by permission of the driver sustained serious injuries by reason of the drivers wanton negligence It was conceded that it was against the drivers express orders to allow anyone to ride with him In an action for damages against the employer it was held the employer was liable Higbee Co v Jackson Ohio 1920 128 N E 6I Io8

j100341,The Review of Economics and Statistics,1928512,An Index of Industrial Stock Prices,i333315,AN INDEX OF INDUSTRIAL STOCK PRICES EDWIN FRICKEY I THE RESULTS M ONTHLY index numbers of industrial stock prices for the period 19022I computed by aver aging the quotations for the common and the preferred shares of twenty manufacturing companies are pre sented graphically in Chart I The two series of com mon and preferred stock indices exhibit marked cyclical fluctuations These series agree in their indication of the dates at which the important upward and downward swings began but as might be expected the common stock index fluctuates much more violently than does the preferred Looking at the curves of Chart I we see that during the year 1902 the trend of the common stock index was slightly upward while that of the preferred stock index was practically horizontal Early in I903 both indices began a downward movement which lasted for about ten months There was little recovery until the middle of the following year Beginning with July I904 a sharp upward movement took place reaching its highest point in January i906 There then followed in succes sion the bear market of i90607 and the bull market of i90809 Stock prices again declined in i9i0 and i9ii but did not reach nearly so low a level as they had at the end of the two preceding slumps The period I9I2I4 was one in which fluctuations in security prices were much less violent than during the decade preceding there was slight recovery in I9I2 followed by moderate decline during the two following years The most noticeable feature of the period I9I5i8 is the divergence which took place between the move ments of the common and the preferred stock indices During the war years the increased earning power of various industrial corporations reflected itself in the quotations of the common shares and the common stock index rose until it reached figures considerably above the average for I902I4 the preferred stocks except for the relatively small number whose dividendpaying records had been poor during the prewar period bene fited very much less from the increase of profits and their prices on the whole showed comparatively little change from the prewar level Examining in greater detail the movements of the indices through the war period we see that the year II4 closed with prices at a low level During the first ten months of I9I5 both series showed a decided upward trend but weakness then developed in the common stocks while the preferred stock index moved horizon tally This continued until September i9i6 when both indices began a rapid advance The recovery was shortlived however and prices fell throughout I917 From the end of I9I7 until the signing of the armistice the indices rose steadily THE PRICE INDICES FOR IRON AND STEEL SHARES COMPARED WITH THOSE FOR OTHER INDUSTRIAL STOCKS Up to this point we have discussed the prices of indus trial stocks as a whole If sufficient data were available it would next be desirable to consider the characteristics of various groups of securities such as the shares of com panies engaged in the manufacture of textiles of iron and steel or of chemicals But there was only one class of industrial stocks  those of iron and steel  in which it was possible over the entire period selected for study to obtain quotations for a sufficiently large num ber of securities to make practicable the computation of a group index The only subdivision which it was feas ible to make then was one separating the iron and steel shares from other industrial stocks The twenty com panies whose stocks had previously been employed in the construction of our indices for all industrials which have just been presented were accordingly divided into two groups composed respectively of i eight iron and steel companies and 2 twelve other manu facturing companies Then for each group a common stock and a preferred stock index were computed The results appear in Charts II and IIVJ1 These charts clearly reveal the general similarity of the indices for iron and steel stocks Chart II to the corresponding indices for stocks other than iron and steel Chart III and consequently to the corresponding indices for industrial stocks as a whole Chart I It is evident that the description of the movements of the averages for all industrials given in the preceding sec tion applies equally well to either of the two subordi nate groups This similarity between the two groups is even more clearly brought out by Charts IV and V Let us first consider the common stock indices shown in Chart IV It will be seen that throughout the period I902i8 the prices of the iron and steel common stocks fluctuated within somewhat wider limits than didthose of other industrial common stocks in all other respects how ever there was a remarkably close correspondence be tween the cyclical movements of the two series though it is of course possible to point out months such as February and March 1905 when minor variations appear 1 The process by which the indices were computed is fully explained on pp 270274 Their numerical values are given in Table IV pp 275277 We shall publish in a later issue of the REvIEW index numbers for the years I9192I which are based upon a much more extensive list of securities and a more elaborate classification than it is possible to employ for the period I902i8 and which are therefore more completely representative of the entire industrial field as it exists at the present time For the reason just stated we are discussing in this article only the movements which took place up to and including the year i9i8 However for the benefit of those who may desire series of stock price averages which extend from I902 to I92i and which are based upon a uniform list of securities throughout the indices have been brought up to date 264 AN INDEX OF INDUSTRIAL STOCK PRICES 265 0501 1000 150 DU0 1903 1904 19 1906 1907

similarity between their movements is even greater than that between the corresponding averages for the common shares The preferred indices for the two groups fluctuate with about equal violence and their cyclical movements are in marked agreement During the years I902I4 the two series show no di vergence of importance other than that in their trends over the period as a whole The iron and steel preferred stock index gradually rose from 823 in July I902 to 864 in July I9I4 an increase of 50 per cent between the same dates the index for other preferred stocks fell from 992 to 885 a decrease of io8 per cent If now we examine the movements of the preferred averages for the years I9I5i8 Chart V we see that the two series while continuing to show fluctuations of similar form gradually diverged from each other A study of the dividend records for the securities making up the indices reveals the cause of this discrepancy Among the twelve stocks included in the group other than iron and steel there were two  American Hide and Leather preferred and American Linseed pre ferred  on which practically no dividends had been paid since the organization of the companies2 When in i9i6 and I9I7 respectively these stocks began to pay dividends their prices rose sharply and the in creases for the two securities were sufficient to raise the average for the group to a level above that of earlier years Our iron and steel group on the other hand in cluded no preferred stocks which had such decidedly poor dividendpaying records for the period I902I4 and hence the prosperity of the war years did not cause either the prices of individual stocks or the aver age for the group to show marked increases over pre war figures 200 m 2SC u l0 L LL II 11 1 OEON AND STEEL E Base Ae met5cazTeragefoI I3 O

PRICES 267 THE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE CYCLICAL MOVEMENTS OF THE PRICE INDICES FOR COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCKS We have just considered the relationships of the two group indices for common stocks to each other and of the two group indices for preferred stocks to each other We will next compare the variations of common stock prices with those of preferred stock prices In connec tion with Chart I p 265 we have already noted that while fluctuations in prices are much more violent for common stocks than for preferred the indices for the two classes of shares agree in their indication of the turning points which mark the beginning and ending of the longer swings in stock quotations In order to make possible a more definite comparison between the cyclical movements of the common and the preferred indices corrected figures  were secured by eliminating the slight upward trend which existed in each case and then these corrected figures were plotted on scales so determined that the fluctuations of the two series should be of comparable magnitude The resulting figures ap pear in Chart VI Except for the years I905 and i906 when the curve for the common stocks rises to a some what sharper peak the two series practically coincide This close correspondence between them over the period I902I4 as a whole shows that the quotations for indus trial preferred stocks though fluctuating within com paratively narrow limits reflect the alternations of prosperity and depression quite as well as do the prices of the corresponding common shares COMPARISON OF OuR INDEX NUMBERS WITH THOSE OF THE WALL STREET JOURNAL It is of interest to compare our index numbers for the prices of twenty industrial common stocks with the well known series of industrial stock price averages com piled by Dow Jones and Co and published in the Wall Street Journal2 Since the makeup of the latter series was altered after the reopening of the exchanges in December I9I4 it is convenient to discuss separately the prewar and war periods3 The PreWar Years I902I4 Let us first consider the more important differences in the method of construction of the two series i The DowJones index is computed by the use of arithmetic averages of actual prices upon such aver ages a given percentage change in the quotations of stocks selling at high prices has a much greater effect than an equal percentage change in the quotations of 2 al lt  I  1 14  1902 1903 1904 1905 1906 1907 1908 1909 1910 1911 1912 11913 1914 CHART VI COMPARISON OF THE CYCLICAL MOVEMENTS OF INDEX NUMBERS FOR THE PRICES OF I THFF COMMO0N AND 2 THE PREFERRED STOCKS OF TWENTY INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES The longtime trends have been eliminated and the flctuations of the two series have been reduced to comparable size 1 The corrected figures for series of business statistics are obtained by eliminating from the actual figures the secular trend or longtime move ment over a period of years and the seasonal fluctuations to which most trades and business in general are subject For some series among which are security prices no seasonal movement exists and in such cases only the correction for longtime trend is required The process by which cor rected figures are secured and the method by which through the use of the standard deviation the fluctuations of the various series are reduced to comparable size are explained on pp 47 of our circular entitled The Index of General Business Conditions a NonTechnical Explanation They are also set forth in THE REvIEw OF ECONOMIC STATISTICS for Febru ary I920 PP 40 4i A complete discussion from the technical statistical point of view appears in the REVIEW for January i9i9 Dow Jones and Co present their data in the form of daily averages for the 2prices of the stocks included in their index At intervals summary tables are given showing the high and low prices for each month The high figure is simply the highest dailyaverage occurring in the given month and similarly the low figure is the lowest daily average in the month For the period I902I7 the REviEw reduced the Wall Street Journals figures to a single series by taking monthly arithmetic means between these monthly high and low averages Beginning with January i9i8 the monthly averages were secured by taking monthly means of the daily averages For a complete discussion of the DowJones index see THE REvIEW OF Eco NOMIC STATISTICS for April W9I9 pp I45I47 3 The Wall Street Journals series for the period January I902 to July 19I4 based upon twelve stocks was replaced by a series beginning December I9I4 based upon twenty From December I914 to October i9i6 quotations for both series were available During this time the fluctuations of the two were similar the average for the twelve over the 23 months was i0890 and that for the twenty was 8i6o The ratio of these two averages to each 8i6o other was   75I per cent In order to form a continuous series i0890 from the Wall Street Journals figures their averages based upon twenty stocks were multiplied through by this ratio beginning with December I914268 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STATISTICS stocks selling at low prices Our index which is formed from geometric averages has the important advantage that equal percentage changes in prices have equal effects regardless of the level on which quotations are fluctuating 2 The list of securities making up our index remains unchanged throughout the period while a number of substitutions occur in the DowJones list These sub stitutions to a certain extent destroy the comparability of their averages for earlier and later years 3 The index numbers constructed by the REVIEW are based upon a larger number of securities than are the averages of the Wall Street Journal there being twenty stocks included in the former and only twelve in the latter 4 The securities making up our index form a homo geneous group  they are all common stocks of manu facturing companies The DowJones list on the other hand embraces ten common and two preferred stocks and among the common shares there appear the stocks of one mining company and of one public utility In Table I is shown a comparison of the securities entering the two indices the five stocks common to both being indicated by italics In spite of the important differences in method of con struction however the two averages when both have been reduced to the base I909I3 exhibit surprising similarities over the period we are now considering I90214 see Chart VII They agree in showing a slight upward trend during these years furthermore their fluctuations exhibit a very close correspondence Ex cept for minor variations in movement they differ only in that the DowJones series possibly on account of the two preferred stocks which it includes fluctuates some what less violently than does the index computed by the REVIEW The agreement between the cyclical move ments of the two indices is even more clearly shown in Chart VIII where they have been corrected by the elimination of their longtime trends and their fluctua tions have been reduced to comparable size TABLE I  COMPARISON OF SECURITIES INCLUDED IN I INDEX NUMBERS FOR THE PRICES OF

DowJones averages moved closely together during I9I5I7 the first three years of the war period see Chart VII In i9i8 however a consider able divergence took place Our index rose sharply throughout the year while that of the Wall Street Jour nal showed only a moderate increase This discrepancy is due to differences in the composition of the two in dices In our list there appear five chemical stocks whose prices showed an average increase of 6o per cent during the year the Wall Street Journals average in cluded no chemical stocks On the other hand among the securities making up the Wall Street Journals list there were two telephone and telegraph stocks whose quotations showed a decrease for December i9i8 as compared with December I9I7 and two copper stocks whose prices increased but slightly over the twelve months neither of these two classes of shares were represented in our index These differences in the movements of certain series entering into the averages account for the failure of the latter to move together during i9i81 THE PRICE SERIES IN THE INDEX OF GENERAL BUSINESS CONDITIONS Our Index Chart of General Business Conditions Chart IX 2 is made up of three group

The longtime trends have been eliminated and theflctuations of the two series have been reduced to comparable size 1 The divergence between the indices during the years I9192I will be considered in a later article 2 The methods employed in the construction of the Index are fully explained in the publications to which reference is made in footnote i p 267 The Index Chart for the period November i9i8 to date will be found on p 25I of this issue of the REVIEW270 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STATISTICS by New York City bank clearings and 2 the prices of bonds and stocks the index for Group B Business is based upon i the volume of pigiron production and outside clearings and 2 the wholesale prices of com modities and the index for Group C Banking is based upon i the volume of credit extended as indicated by loans and deposits of New York banks and 2 the price of such credit as indicated by the rate of interest on commercial paper As Chart IX clearly shows a definite relationship exists between the movements of the three curves Their turning points whether upward or downward always come in the same order The turning points in speculation curve A precede by a number of months the turning points in wholesale commodity prices and general business activity as reflected in curve B and similarly the turning points in curve B precede by several months the major movements of curve C bank ing In order to determine whether or not the same relationship would appear if the volume series were omitted and price series only were employed Chart X was constructed In this chart there is presented a com parison of the corrected figures 2 for three price series one from each of the groups making up our Index Chart These series are as follows from the speculative group A the prices of industrial stocks as indicated by our indices for twenty common stocks from the business group B the wholesale prices of commodities as in dicated by Bradstreets index and from the banking group C the price of loans as indicated by commer cial paper rates It will be seen that the relationships previously found to exist for the curves of our Index Chart also hold in general for the corrected figures of the three price series shown in Chart X The more important movements of industrial stock prices representing the speculative group precede those of wholesale commodity prices representing the business group and the latter in turn precede the fluctuations in the rate of interest represent ing the banking group This sequence is maintained uniformly throughout with the single exception of the year i9ii when the stock price series was the second to rise rather than the first II THE METHOD THE PURPOSE OF THE INDEX In the construction of any index number it is desirable that from the very beginning the use to which that index is to be put should be kept clearly in mind for at almost every step of the computation questions will arise which can be correctly settled only if the purpose of the index is taken into account In the case of stock price indices decisions must be made as to what securities are to be included whether daily weekly or monthly quotations shall be taken what form of average shall be employed 1903 104 1905 1906 1907 1908 1909 1910 1911 1912 1913 1914 CHART IX THE INDEX OF GENERAL BUSINESS CONDITIONS A SPECULATION PRICES OF SECURITIES AND VOLUME OF STOCK SALES B

27I whether or not the index shall be weighted and if it is to be weighted what the criterion of importance shall be On these points different conclusions will be reached depending upon whether the index is primarily intended to register the changes in the total money value of a given set of securities or to show the trend in prices over a considerable period of time or to serve as a barometer of general speculative conditions In con structing our indices the purpose was not to measure the aggregate money cost of a selected group of shares or to compare price levels at widely separated dates we de sired rather to secure indices representing as accu rately as possible those longtime swings or cyclical movements in stock prices which indicate the alterna tion of general speculative activity and depression THE DATA UTILIZED Previous to the selection of the data to be used in con structing our indices a careful study was made of the quotations for individual securities It would have been too great a task however to transcribe and to plot monthly figures for every stock quoted during the pe riod and for this reason annual data were employed in the preliminary investigation Poors Manuals 1 give convenient summary tables showing the annual high and low prices since I902 for all stocks quoted on the New York Stock Exchange and for the more important stocks traded in on other exchanges The annual high and low prices I90220 for the stocks except those of railroads having complete an nual quotations over this period were transcribed and put in graphic form A comparison of the charts re vealed the fact that the various classes of securities which are sometimes grouped together to form indices of industrial stock prices differ from each other in the character of their fluctuations The quotations for the shares of manufacturing companies showed tendencies unlike those of public utility or mining stocks It was clear then that separate indices for these classes would give much more information than would a general index in which nonhomogeneous elements were combined The present study has been confined to the construction of indices for the most important of these classes of stocks  those of manufacturing companies In making up the list of securities to be included in the index two criteria were established i Completeness of data Only those companies were included for whose common stocks substantially complete monthly high and low quotations were available since 1902 2 Size of corporation No organization was in cluded whose total assets at the end of the fiscal year 1910 were less than 20000000 There were twentyfive companies which satisfied both tests Of these twentyfive three the General Electric Company Swift and Company and the United Shoe Machinery Corporation were dropped from the list for the reason that in each case stock dividends re peatedly interrupted the continuity of the quotations and the task of making the necessary adjustments would have been a considerable one Two other corpo rations the International Paper Company and theWest inghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company were excluded the first because of the shift in the price level of its stock produced by the rearrangement of its securi ties in I9I7 and the second on account of the break in quotations brought about by the receivership and re organization through which the company passed in I907o8 The omission of the five corporations just mentioned reduced our list to twenty names which were divided into two groups as follows Iron and steel American Car and Foundry Co American Locomotive Co Pressed Steel Car Co Railway SteelSpring Co Republic Iron and Steel Co SlossSheffield Steel and Iron Co United States Cast Iron Pipe and Foundry Co United States Steel Corporation Other than iron and steel American Agricultural Chemical Co American Cotton Oil Co American Hide and Leather Co American Linseed Co American Sugar Refining Co American Woolen Co Central Leather Co Corn Products Refining Co National Biscuit Co National Lead Co United States Rubber Co VirginiaCarolina Chemical Co It was found that practically complete series of price quotations for preferred stocks of these twenty com panies could be secured as well as the quotations for common stocks Consequently as we have said both common and preferred stocks are covered in the present study For each of the forty securities monthly average prices were obtained by taking arithmetic means be tween the monthly high and low quotations2 If it had 1 Our annual data were taken from Poors Manual of Railroads I902 and I920 2 The monthly high and low quotations for I902i8 were taken from the annual issues of the Financial Review those for I9I92I from the Commer cial and Financial Chronicle In general these quotations represent the prices at which actual sales took place on the New York Stock Exchange When for a given month there were no transactions in a particular security on the New York exchange the prices from another exchange were em ployed if these were lacking the missing figure was supplied by using the mean of the bid and asked quotations given in the monthly Bank and Quotation Section of the Commercial and Financial Chronicle When neither sales nor bid and asked prices were available the gap was filled in by interpolation see pp 274 The New York Stock Exchange was closed from July 3I to December I 2 I914 No data were available for the months of August and September Our prices for October and November were taken from the unofficial quota tions published in the Financial Review for I9I5 pp I57i6i For the period I902I7 the Boston Stock Exchange figures were used for American Agricultural Chemical common and preferred which during these272 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STATISTICS been our purpose to determine with considerable exact ness the monthtomonth fluctuations in stock prices it would have been necessary for us to make our monthly averages from daily or at any rate weekly quotations As has been indicated however our primary interest was in the longer movements of stock prices which are indicative of the changes in general speculative condi tions and these movements could be measured with amply sufficient accuracy by the use of the high and low prices for each month ADJUSTMENTS Throughout the period I9022I there were a number of cases in which because of a change in status of a given stock the prices for that security abruptly shifted to a new level and it was necessary to make an adjustment in the quotations These changes in quotations result ing from other than market  causes were of three kinds  those brought about by a reorganizations b stock dividends and c stock subscriptions at favor able rates a Reorganizations The method of adjusting the quotations for reorganizations will be illustrated by the case of the United States Leather Company which was succeeded in I905 by the Central Leather Company The prices of the stocks for July I905 the month in which quotations for Central Leather first appeared on the New York Stock Exchange record were Common stocks High Low Mean of high and low Central Leather  47 4I2 4425 United States Leather I3 I22 I294 Preferred stocks Central Leather I05o2 I032 10450 United States Leather I io8l I1019 In this month during which the quotations for the shares of the companies overlapped then the mean price of Central Leather common bore to the mean price of United States Leather common the ratio 4425 I294 342 per cent Hence the adjustment was made by multiplying the quotations for the latter stock January I902June I905 by 342 per cent For the preferred stock the adjustment factor was 10450  948 per cent b Stock dividends As an example we will consider the stock dividend of 333 per cent paid to the com mon shareholders of the SlossSheffeld Steel and Iron Company in October I905 The payment of this divi dend did not of course change the value of the proper ties owned by the corporation its effect was to in crease in the ratio 1333 or 4 the number of shares I00 3 into which the ownership of those properties was di 100 3 vided and thereby to decrease in the ratio 3 or the value of each share Hence the quotations prior to September 20 I905 the date on which the security was first quoted exstockdividend were multiplied by i or 75 per cent in order to make those quotations comparable with subsequent figures c Stock subscriptions at favorable rates The only case in which the granting of subscription rights to stockholders at a rate below the market price brought about a decided break in quotations was that of the United States Rubber Company in i919 In September of that year all common shareholders were given the right to subscribe for ioo per cent additional stock at par In other words each common shareholder had the privilege of buying from the company at the price of ioo a share a number of shares equal to that which he already held On September ii i919 the last day before the stock was quoted exrights on the New York Stock Exchange the prices of United States Rubber common were as follows High Low Mean of high and low I302 I24 I 2725 If we assume I2725 the mean of these high and low prices to be a reasonably close approximation to the market value of one share of the stock just before the security was quoted exrights what followed may be thought of in this way If the owner of a single share of stock surrendered to the company that share the market value of which we have just estimated to be I2725 together with ioooo in cash the combined worth of the share and the money payment being I2725  I0000  22725 he would receive in return two shares of stock each one of which then might be expected to show a market value of 2 X 22725  I I3622 Now if we take I2725 and 1I362 respectively as approximations to the market value of one share just before and just after the right to subscribe expired we secure the ratio 3272  893 per cent as the factor by which quotations prior to September 12 1919 should be multiplied There were a number of other companies whose shares were from time to time offered to stockholders at rates below the market price In all other instances however both the theoretical correction and the actual change in quotations were so slight that it was clearly not worth while to make any adjustment years were quoted with somewhat greater regularity there than on the New York Stock Exchange The preferred stock quotations employed for United States Rubber were of course those for the first preferred The quotations for September i9 and 20 I905 were as follows High Low Mean of high and low September i9 1905  932 928 9318 September 20 I905  7I4 68 7000   Exstockdividend The mean price of September 20 bore to the mean price of September i9 the 7000 ratio  75I per cent corresponding very closely with the theoretical 931 figure of 750 per cent 2 On September 12 i919 when United States Rubber common was first quoted exrights the mean of the high and low prices was 11388 a very close agreement with this theoretical figureAN INDEX OF INDUSTRIAL STOCK PRICES 273 METHOD OF AVERAGING After such adjustments as were required had been made in the quotations it was next necessary to decide upon the process to be employed in combining the prices for the different stocks to form indices The number of items was so small as to make the use of the median im practicable The choice of method then lay between the use of geometric means on the one hand and of aggregates I or arithmetic means on the other Aggre gates and arithmetic means are superior to geometric means as measures of the changes in the total amount of money that a given set of stocks or commodities cost but geometric means are better measures of the average percentage of change in prices over a period of time2 In the problem now under consideration we were primarily interested in the average relative changes in stock prices rather than in the aggregate money cost of a group of securities consequently the geometric mean was con sidered the better type of average for our purpose The next questions to be settled were whether or not this geometric mean was to be weighted and if so what the basis of weighting should be The answer to these questions obviously depended upon the purpose for which the index was to be constructed In his article entitled A Critique of Index Numbers of the Prices of Stocks Professor Wesley C Mitchell discussing this point says If the aim is to show the average changes in the prices of securities held by the public the amount of stock outstanding yields the logical set of weights If the aim is to throw light on the changes in the prices of business enterprises as such then gross earnings the best available gauge of the volume of business trans acted may be used as weights If the aim is to find the average changes in the prices of stocks that are traded in then the number of shares sold should be used 3 But in constructing our index numbers it was not our object to do any of these things As has already been stated we wished rather to obtain an index which should represent the effect of those influences which brought about the longtime swings or cyclical movements in security prices Consequently if the stocks were to be weighted at all they should have been weighted accord ing to their values as indicators of general speculative conditions An examination of the price charts for the various stocks showed remarkable agreement in the in dication of the turning points in industrial stock prices Over the period chosen for study there appeared to be little ground for a selection of some stocks as being su perior to others for the purpose of measuring general speculative activity Consequently it was decided that our index numbers should not be weighted In order however to determine the extent to which a weighted and an unweighted index number would differ from each other a test was made The data employed for this experiment were the prices of the twenty com mon stocks for November of each year i90220 This particular month was selected after the charts for the individual stocks had been carefully examined and it had been found that nearly all of the important turning points in quotations had occurred either in November or in one of the two months October and December which lie nearest November and consequently the figures for successive Novembers would show better than those for any other month of the year the longer swings of indus trial stock prices For the data selected two index numbers were calcu lated The first was an unweighted geometric mean The second was a weighted geometric mean computed in the manner which will now be described The twenty stocks were divided into manufacturing groups the classification of the United States Bureau of the Census being adopted These groups together with the number of securities included in each were as fol lows 4 Food and kindred products  3 Textiles and their products  I Iron and steel and their products 5  6 Leather and its finished products  2 Chemicals and allied products 5 Vehicles for land transportation I  2 Miscellaneous I For each of these seven classes an index number was computed by taking geometric means of the prices of the securities included Since it was impossible within any given group to determine the relative value of the stocks as indicators of speculative conditions for that group these geometric means were not weighted In combining these averages to form a single index for industrial stocks as a whole the different groups were weighted according to value added by manufacture in 1909 as reported by the Bureau of the Census The value added by manufacture represents probably better than any other available figure the relative im portance of the various industrial groups in particular 1909 was selected as the basis of weighting for the reason that it was the most recent census year for which data were at the same time fully obtainable and unaffected by the war6 Chart Xl shows a comparison of the weighted and the unweighted index numbers for the prices of the twenty common stocks It will be observed that for the period I Professor Irving Fishers ideal index number may be regarded as a special case of the index based on aggregates for his process is I to com pute two index numbers both based on aggregates but differently weighted and then 2 to take a mean the geometric between these two indices thus obtaining a single figure A complete discussion of Professor Fishers for mula will be found in THE REVIEW OF EcoNOwwc STATISTICS for May I92I pp I03II3 2 As compared with arithmetic means of relative prices geometric means have the further advantage that the latter can readily be shifted from one base period to another and the former cannot IJournal of Political Economy July igi6 p 687 4 Only seven of the Census Bureaus fourteen groups were represented in our list of twenty stocks 6 The eight securities which we in our broader classification p 27I designated as iron and steel stocks are here subdivided under the two headings iron and steel and their products and vehicles for land trans portation 6 The weights here employed in combining the group indices of stock prices are the same as those used by Dr E E Day in computing his index numbers of physical production for manufacture See THE REVIEW OF EcoNomic STATISTICS for November I920 pp 322 323274 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STATISTICS I902i8 1 the two curves exhibit marked agreement except that in November I902 the weighted index is somewhat lower than the unweighted and in November i905 the reverse is true So far as the indication of cyclical movements in stock prices is concerned how ever these differences are not of importance It is evi dent that had we computed weighted instead of un weighted means our conclusions would not have been modified Furthermore for the particular purpose of constructing an industrial stock index over the prewar and war periods it is doubtful whether the weighted mean is logically superior to the unweighted for the number of securities which fall in the various census groups is in most cases so small as to make the process of computing indices for those groups one of question able validity INTERPOLATIONS When neither sales quotations nor bid and asked prices were available for a particular security in a given month an interpolated figure was computed to fill the gap Table III illustrates the method em ployed The case taken is that of American Cotton Oil preferred one of the twelve securities previously chosen to make up the preferred group index for the stocks other than iron and steel see p 27 I In the months of January and February I920 no quotations were avail able for the stock just named Interpolated figures were secured by assuming that had American Cotton Oil preferred been traded in during these months its price would have changed in the same ratio as did the geometric average price for the other eleven stocks of this group But different interpolated values might be obtained by this method If we began with December i99 and worked forward we found that for the other eleven pre ferred stocks of the group prices in January I920 bore 10822 on the average the ratio I o8  I00I4 per cent to io8o7 prices in December i919 Assuming the same percent age change for American Cotton Oil preferred we se cured as its interpolated price for January I920 I00I4 per cent of its price in December i919 or I0014 per cent of 89oo  89I2 If on the other hand we began with March I920 and worked backward we found that for the eleven stocks the average price in January was io8 22 1099  I0308 per cent of the average price for March Applying this percentage to the March price for Ameri can Cotton Oil preferred we secured i0308 per cent of 855088I3 as the interpolated figure for January We thus had two values  89I2 and 88i3  for the inter polated price of American Cotton Oil preferred in Jan uary I920 one obtained by working forward and the other by working backward Since the two processes were equally valid there was no reason for choosing one result rather than the other and the geometric mean between them 8862 was taken as our interpolated figure for January The February item was secured by a process similar to that just described COMPUTATION OF THE INDEX NUMBERS After the unweighted geometric mean had been de cided upon as the form of average to be employed and all missing items had been supplied by interpolation six sets of index numbers were computed as follows 2 i For the eight iron and steel common stocks 2 For the twelve other common stocks 3 For the twenty common stocks combined 4 For the eight iron and steel preferred stocks 5 For the twelve other preferred stocks 6 For the twenty preferred stocks combined In each of the six cases the indices were obtained by a taking unweighted geometric means of the actual monthly prices and b reducing these means to relative numbers with their geometric average I909I3 as the base The indices thus secured are presented graphically on pages 265 266 and their numerical values are given below in Table IV 300 1 150 Nov Nov Nov NOV NOv 1902 1905 1910 1915 1920 CHART XI  COMPARISON

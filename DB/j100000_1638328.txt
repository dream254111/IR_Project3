Garrisonon Hudson N Y RESEARCH FOUNDATIONS IN THEIR RELATION TO MEDICINE 1 AT this time and place medicine is the central interest and therefore so far as a layman can it is my purpose to discuss Research Foundations in their Relation to Medicine and if possible to do this in such a manner as to reveal their signifi cance to those for whose encouragement these ceremonies have been devised To accomplish this I intend first to ask you to consider the mental attitude necessary for the appreciation of research foundations and then to describe these foundations broadlytrying to indicate their relations to the universities the prob lems which arise in connection with them the dangers to which they are exposed and their significance for the progress of medi cine for yourselves and for the develop ment of the spirit of research You who are about to pass from the dis cipline of the school to a more selfde pendent phase of your career feel both the fresh pleasure of restraints outgrown and a questing interest in the coming years You feel too that broadly speaking what will happen to medicine during the next fifty years will also happen to you and that at any moment some of you may be called upon to guide these happenings In the face of such responsibilities it becomes a duty as well as a wise precau tion to obtain the broadest possible view across your chosen field and to gain knowl edge of the larger changes and improve ments taking place within it You may have done this several times Address at the graduation exercises of the Yale Medical School June 17 1912     I   N S VOL XXXVI No 916 before but I venture to predict that if you live and succeed you will do it many times again The Greek philosopher Heraclitus laid weight on the idea that all things are in a state of flux The notion has not always been approved We know that this idea in some of its aspects was repugnant to the early Victorian gentlemen but today we are less prone than those of earlier genera tions to dogmatize on the impossible and in this country and this phase of civilization we feel with its full force the forward flow of things so that for us nothing is more certain than the progressive change and onward movement in medical theory and hence in medical practise During the years of your training you have been carried more or less uncon sciously along and thus helped to keep in touch with the development of medical thought but at this moment when the stream of knowledge is about to cast you out upon its shores and you are asked to walk on alone it is worth while to inquire what is your preparation for the experience From these halls and laboratories you bear away a load of learninghaply you bear it lightly It is to this possession that I wish to direct attention for a moment The knowledge we accumulate is a very mixed article but in this mixture theie are two sorts which it is well for us to consider now One sort consists of certain formulas which control our incidental actions for instance we all know on occasion when to stand up or to sit down and you know the technique and procedure for various sur gical operations A great fraction of our information is in this form a form not necessarily subject to frequent or radical change This sort however is of minor interest to us now and has been mentioned here only that it may serve as a foil to the more important kind This more important kind of knowledge is that on the basis of which we can foresee and predict There are manifold varieties of this and they range from that which permits us to predict with a high degree of confidence the rising of tomorrows sun to that with which one ventures to predict the weather or the fate of a patient with baffling symp toms In these latter instances the course of events is by no means unpredictable but only so dependent on complex factors and conditions that we rarely have at once at hand enough information to make a re spectable guess This fact bears very di rectly on the matter before us for when we scrutinize our intellectual possessions we find them to consist in large measure of information useful for prediction yet mainly information so incomplete that the conclusions or theoriesif you choose based on it must be largely held as open to revision and therefore can be used with safety only by those who carry in mind just how much or how little each conclu sion has to rest upon Nevertheless it is just these tentative conclusions or theories which the medical man must so largely utilize Probably you have thought of this before if so you know that to the revela tions of this analysis men react in very different ways Some throw up their hands in the face of so much uncertainty others stretch certainty to the limit and seek to make it cover all they have been taught and then cultivate impenetrability because change is disquieting and new knowledge means new labor while those born under happier stars are neither crushed nor blinded but recognize that intellectual health and vigor imply an unceasing re placement of both data and conclusions to be accomplished only when the period of 66 SCIENCESCIENCE mental growth is made conterminous with life Capacity for such continued growth is conspicuous in the masters and a hall mark of the eminent Indeed as you proceed in the investigation of your fellows you will be surprised to find how early growth may cease and how significant the event can be In fardistant communities mental growth has been known to stop on commencement day It is consoling however to be as suredas I can assure youthat we ob serve this woeful arrest more clearly and sooner in our fellows than in ourselvesa suggestive fact which needs only to be men tioned in order to be appreciated As you see the reason for this preface touching the nature of our mental posses sions is my wish to emphasize the need for the full recognition of the unsolved or partly solved problems in medicine and the necessity for holding in mind the facts on which all such tentative solutions as we use are based When this need has been recog nized it is possible to take the point of view from which research foundations can be discussed with greatest benefit for pri marily it is their purpose to replace less certain by more certain facts Indeed dis cussion of these foundations can be signifi cant only for those who like yourselves know that the students career is for life never to be commutednot even for good behaviorand in no wise limited by any formal function such as graduation or a state board test Turning now to the research foundations themselves it may be well by way of intro duction to give a word of explanation touching the coming treatment of them I desire to speak as an inquirer not as an advocate but as these inquiries have led me to some definite conclusions I shall ven ture to express them briefly Beyond this all things rest with you While we are specially interested in re search foundations in their relation to medicine yet those with such relations are but a fraction of the number in existence and for the most part have come late A research foundation may be defined as one especially intended to produce new and better knowledge Thus the main purpose and aim serves broadly to differentiate such a foundation from the universities and other educational establishments in which a greater emphasis is put on the conserva tion distribution or application of knowl edge while at the same time both sorts of institutions have been and are producers also The new foundations are then by no means essentially novel but in one sense outgrowths or specialized extensions of the older educational establishments This im plies of course that what they are devised to do has already been included in the existing scheme of things Such being the case our discussion must be framed so as to comprise these facts In the civilization from which we are descended there has always been some en deavor to add to the sum of human knowl edge The acute minds belonging to the end of the medieval period often overstepped the theological and philosophical bounds within which they had their greatest activity and gave to the study of the physical world more or less attention Speculating com piling teaching and even experimenting these men grouped here and there formed the centers from which the earliest univer sities of bur era sprang Later appeared the learned academies also sometimes the patrons of investigation As objects of study the physical problems came first aided by the fact that observa tional and experimental work could be there begun without the preliminary labors of collection and classification which have 67 JULY 19 1912N S VOL XXXVI No 916 necessarily occupied so much time in the biological sciences What is important to point out here is this That whether we date the founding of the modern university laboratory from Lomonossoff at St Petersburg in 1748 or from Liebig at Giessen in 1826 we must admit that a good deal of investigation had gone on in all the principal departments of science previous to such foundations and thus in earlier times investigations were made in scientific workshops unconnected with teaching institutions This fact sug gests that perhaps our research foundations have even less novelty than we were at first inclined to accord to them and that we are dealing now rather with a reappearance of conditionsmuch improved to be sure but quite familiar before the rise of our modern universities It has a direct bear ing on this point to note that in England for example during the earlier part of the last century when the historic universities of that country gave only meager support to experimental science and especially to the biological investigations much of the most important work was done outside of the teaching institutions Joule the student of the mechanical equivalent of heat Perkin discoverer of the aniline dyes Bentham and the Hook ers all three botanists Galton the anthro pologist and Darwin are some instances Moreover for more than a century the Royal Institution of Great Britain the foundation of which in 1799 was largely instigated by our fellow countryman Count Rumford furnished opportunities for re search to Davy Faraday Tyndall and Dewar all men whose contributions to knowledge have been of great importance According to its charter the Royal Insti tution was an establishment in London for diffusing the knowledge of useful mechanical improvements and to teach the application of science to the useful purposes of life This does not sound like the program of a research institution today I can not say just what the steps were which led in this case to a development seemingly so different from that proposed but it is not rash to assume that the men like those who have been named were always hunting rea sons and explanations knowing quite well that others could carry out the application while it was theirs to make the funda mental discoveries an excellent example of the wellknown fact that where an institu tion and a strong man are left to work out the problem of adaptation it is the institu tion that gets adapted Returning from this diversion to our his tory and taking the period from the middle of the preceding century to the present day one can not fail to recall in this coun try such an example as the Smithsonian Institution at Washington and I would add our agricultural experiment stations which started right then faltered but are now coming into their own More extensive in scope and with far greater resources than any of these is the Carnegie Institution of Washington whose magnificent undertakings in the field of science are well known representing as they do a long series of research stations The ideas behind these several founda tions are of the greatest interest In his program of organization in 1847 Joseph Henry first secretary of the Smithsonian Institution states the following To increase knowledge it is proposed 1 to stimulate men of talent to make original researches by offering suitable rewards for memoirs contain ing new truths and 2 to appropriate annually a portion of the income for particular researches under the direction of suitable persons This is what one might expect from Joseph Henry 68 SCIENCEJULY 19 1912 Touching the agricultural experiment stations the history is complicated and per plexing but we are justified I believe in carrying back the guiding idea in their development to that expressed by Washing ton in his annual message to Congress in 1796 where he says when pleading for the establishment of a national board of agri culture that one of the functions of such a board should be to encourage and assist a spirit of discovery and improvement    by stimulating to enterprise and experi ment This is certainly sound doctrine The Carnegie Institution in the original formulation of its general plans was much influenced by the experience and early pro gram of the Smithsonian Institution but the original statement of aims strikes a new note when it declares one of these aims to be To discover the exceptional man in every depart ment of study whenever and wherever found inside or outside of schools and enable him by financial aid to make the work for which he seems specially designed his life work It is said that this paragraph touching the exceptional man has caused much trouble to the Carnegie Institution and often spread its path with thorns It ap pears that in some instances it has been misunderstood Selfdiscovered exceptional men have proved to be embarrassingly nu merous That does not strike one as so very strange however since the community grows wise but slowly The word exceptional you see has suf fered misinterpretation The really excep tional man is not so often the aberrant prodigy as the individual who presents in his composition a large collection of first rate qualities no one of which is neces sarily alarming but all of which together make for scientific effectiveness of the high est order In the course of its develop ment the Carnegie Institution has I think lived up to this ideal with notable success putting the saner interpretation on the word exceptional  My commendation of the paragraph is similarly based But none of these instanceswhich I have mentionedtogether with a large group of otherscome very close to medicine This contact was first clearly established in 1888 by the Pasteur Institute in Paris an insti tute intended to facilitate the work of the great scientist whose name it bore and to continue the remembrance of him It was an instance of the generous giving of aid and assistance to a mastermanwith no prescriptions and no hampering limitations Pasteur was a genius who combined the art of mediation between the laboratory facts and practical problems with the capacity for speculative thought and scientific achievement in the highest sense and who nevertheless did not allow his human inter est to impair his scientific thoroughness In this country among the foundations closely related to medicine we have recently seen established the Rockefeller Institute the Memorial Institute for Infectious Dis eases the Ortho S A Sprague Memorial Institute both of these at Chicago together with a number of others representing much the same purpose but with less ample re sources as well as several funds devoted to the study of cancer tuberculosis or other special diseases These instances because they touch medicine might well be exam ined in detail but we shall discuss them only in their most general relations It seems a fair question to ask why these institutes and funds have been established The immediate causes are plain enough and are frankly philanthropic in most cases Personal experience with a disease has led more than one man to devote a large sum to the search for its control or cure or going a step further and recog nizing that the application of laboratory SCIENCE 69N S VOL XXXVI No 916 results to medicine has brought progress some have desired to furnish opportunities by which this application may be accom plished where it seemed most needed Though not always explicitly expressed the programs of these foundations imply the hope that by such endowments new facts and new points of view fundamentally im portant to medicine may be discovered I like to think that this last idea is at least latent in all these endeavors but no where so far as I know is quite the same note struck as that which is sounded in the initial program of the Carnegie Institution in those words which call attention to the exceptional manthe investigator Turning now to some of the relations in volved it is to be observed that these new foundations are independent and not con nected with existing universities that they tend to draw men from university positions by the attraction of unusual opportunities for work and finally that for the most part they take these men away from formal teaching The situation thus created in the world of education has often been lamented and no little moral pressure is exerted from time to time to induce the institutes to see the wrongness of their position The question thus raised amounts to this Are these new foundations philanthropic vagaries and mere torsos of educational establishments or do they represent the result of mature consideration and a defi nite endeavor to advance Of the several reasons which have brought about the independence of these foundations the common desire to keep alive the donors name and fame has played its part but more than this I think has been the feeling that since these founda tions were to be devoted to research either in the line of mediation to which I have already referred or in the endeavor to obtain new truths of fundamental impor tance therefore the workers in these insti tutes should be as far as possible released from any duties likely to divert their ener gies To make this arrangement within the limits of a university is to say the least to subject the favored appointee to no little strain His colleagues being human at heart often resent his seeming freedom from re sponsibility and he is allowed to feel that somehow he does not justify himself by attending to his work alone It is unneces sary to enlarge on this situation but I can assure you that it is no mere product of my fancy Separateness of manage ment brings protection therefore to those who choose this work Still more important for ultimate success is the general conduct of such a founda tion Our universities are guided by ex perienced administrators who feel keenly the need for the diffusion of knowledge for making it accessible to large numbers and for preserving withal a completeness and balance in their institutions These views become ingrained but they do not represent the aims of a research foundation and the same board could hardly manage both with like success For the investigator buildings are fine when they suit his purpose after that he loses interest His notion of efficiency is a large emergency fund and whether the fixed charges are great or small is not so impor tant as the means to act promptly de cisively and even expensively when occa sions arise This arrangement is possible only when the institution is a good deal of a unit and absolutely free To appreciate the needs thus briefly out lined requires the experience which breeds sympathy and it has thus come to pass that so far as the arrangement of the scientific program the formation of the personnel 70 SCIENCEJULY 19 1912 SCIENCE and the expenditure of funds are con cerned the control in many of our insti tutes is in the hands of the staff aided by a small group of scientific advisers them selves active workers and keenly alive to the needs of the investigator This leaves the actual care of the funds with the trus tees but puts the scientific activities in the hands of scientific men The arrangement solves several problems and seems essential for the healthy development of research foundations In view of all of these facts it does not appear very strange that independence has been desired for the newer establishments This brings us to the problem of getting menmen who will attempt to realize the highest aims and aspirations of these foun dations These have been taken largely from university laboratories and have been attracted to the newer work by the prospect of more time and resources to apply to their chosen problems and by more fitting salaries Of course it has happened at times that in arranging the program of some founda tions emphasis has been put on finding the answer to some specific question which was in the donors mind This is unfortunate so far as it implies a limitation of the scien tific work but on the other hand in many cases the investigator has been given ample freedom to pursue his own course and de vote his time to matters often seemingly remote in other words to follow where his research led The situation demands above all things faith in the sincerity of purpose of the investigator and fortunately this is granted with increasing frequency In these institutions which serve to medi ate on the one hand between the findings of science and practical problems and on the other to give opportunity for the attain ment of fundamental facts there is a con stant danger threatening every searcher after new knowledge The mediation work because it involves as one element a prac tical problem is moderately intelligible to the laity and extremely handy when it comes to giving an account of things done It may become thereby unduly attractive By contrast the search for the new knowledge is rarely intelligible to the com munity at large and must often be de scribed in terms of things in mind rather than of things accomplished and thus this kind of activity often lacks for encourage ment Let me illustrate Some years ago the need of protection from diphtheria was urgent The infecting organism and its biological characters on the one hand were known on the other the dread disease was only too familiar How could laboratory knowledge be used to solve the clinical problem You are familiar with the an swer which was given in the form of the diphtheria antitoxin That is a splendid example of work in mediation as done in research institutes But a further question arises How does the antitoxin produce its effect This is quite another sort of problem at first glance it appears to have little practical bearing and yet the answer to it in even one instance may lead to a wider view of the processes of immunity The solution of problems of this class is different from the work of mediation certainly of equal rank with it and yet in every way harder to support and harder to carry on since the results can not in the first instance possibly appeal to any save the welltrained few In this there lies an obstacle to progress which you can largely help to remove Because the men who can do this latter kind of work are relatively rare even among investigators because such work can have rational appreciation from a limited group only and because knowledge of this sort is sure to become the basis for many 71N S VOL XXXVI No 916 mediations in the future it behooves us all to see to it that we foster such investigators the most valuable of our natural re sources Perhaps it occurs to some of you that you have seen one wellknown type of the man I here commend Let me recall him to you An elderly gentleman with an unprogres sive costume and unsteady gait who gen erally fails to recognize his friends upon the street and requires several seconds to accomplish the recall when spoken to Such is the mildly humorous picture with which all are familiar It is often correct so far as it goesonly it is a bit incomplete One should add that this man is working with his head a fact which accounts for almost everything and leaves us pondering why this symptom complex so readily ex cites remark Connected with the conduct of research in these foundations are several other prob lems of more than passing interest The fear is sometimes voiced that in the absence of students those at work will lack an im portant stimulus and suffer deterioration The danger varies with the man In stances are known where men have failed to feel the attraction of institute oppor tunities because they feared the loss of this companionship On the other hand we have the attitude represented by the German university pro fessor who is said to have remarked at the opening of the fall semester Now comes this disagreeable interruption of my work  Doubtless he was a wicked old dyspeptic but for a moment he rose beyond himself and spoke for his burdenbearing caste Let me beg not to be misunderstood I would not for a moment be thought to maintain more than the simple thesis that while teaching is a genuine stimulant to some it is certainly a depressant to others and especially a depressant to those who are disturbed by interruption so that some can drop it without damage to themselves In compensation it may be urged that the effect of the investigators methods and personality is felt by those with whom he is usually surrounded his colleagues and assistants and when so surrounded he is in no more danger of isolation than a man in the university However that is not say ing very much for isolation among col leagues even in universities is a condition which we not only lament but should also seek to change It is an ancient tale The investigators of four centuries ago were chary of talking of their results and these were often published posthumously as the authors preferred to die without as sistanceor the new discoveries were some times couched in cryptic writings as though the author felt that what had given him such years of labor to find out should at least be hard for others to attain That feeling is sometimes found today Once I remarked to a student Your thesis is three times too long Yes he replied but if I did not make it long how would any one know it had taken me two years to do the work We can replace this by a better thought The opportunity to satisfy ones longing for research is a noble privilege but it brings its obligations The advances thus made should be re turned as rapidly as possible to the fund of common knowledge and made accessible to the community at large This is essential for the progress of the plan for most surely is the advanced worker dependent on his colleagues as they on him and ultimately too he is in a larger sense also dependent on the community about him so for both these reasons coop eration of the most complete sort is needful for the common good Expression has been given to the fear that the great resources of our research 72 SCIENCEJULY 19 1912 SCIENCE foundations would breed despondency among those who were compelled to work with simpler devices and less ample means and thus they would do harm Despond ency and research do not dwell together Research is a frame of mind A man may have little leisure and trifling re sources may never have published but if he examines his world in a questioning spirit if he carries with him not only con clusions but the observations on which they rest if he refuses to pound square facts into the round holes that he happens to have in hand he has attained illumina tion The spirit of research is nothing mysterious or remote it is everyday hard sense Unfortunately that does not make it common but it does make it attainable It would be a sorry outcome of these new foundations if they should act as hin drances to investigation in the university laboratories The fear that they will do this is often based on the false impression thaat the sup ply of scientific problems is iimited and thus in danger of exhaustion Let us be rid of that idea Every advance creates new problems problems of increasing im portanceexhaustion is impossible By reason of the permanency of their programs and freedom from certain forms of responsibility institutes may wisely un dertake investigations of a sort hardly pos sible under university conditions The field is thus divided or rather enlarged Both the university laboratories and the insti tutes should gain by this arrangement and what is more they do Before leaving this aspect of our prob lem permit me to point out a peculiar advantage enjoyed by investigators who are working under university conditions When we contrast the institutes with the universities we find that it is within the walls of the university laboratory that it is most easy to carry on the search for new knowledge undisturbed by the thought of any applications which it may have In the face of some things already said this statement may appear paradoxical yet it describes a condition In the judg ment of the educated public the teaching investigator fulfills his public obligations when he gives a stated amount of instruc tion After that there is a general feeling that the man should be allowed to follow his bent and if this takes the form of re search the community does not feel obliged to inquire too closely concerning the prac tical value of the work Thus in a way the university man is protected in his research by his teaching obligations while the man in the institute engaged in the same sort of investigation is if anything more open to criticism and at the same time without the defense which is possessed by his uni versity colleague and in so far he stands at a disadvantage As you see I have been concerned in this address with medicine as represented by yourselves in relation to the research insti tutes and that explains the manner of this presentation It has been my purpose to show that in these foundations we have something which represents an advance in our educational devices Their independence is an asset They may be counted on to mediate in a measure between the initial facts of the laboratory and the problems presented by disease but more important though harder to main tain is their function as laboratories where new knowledge is obtained which in turn must have still wider applications All this concerns you who are just enter ing on your life work You can receive direct benefits and enjoy new privileges by reason of these greater opportunities but they also bring to you fresh responsibilities 73N S VOL XXXVI No 916 So far as any of you look upon these foundations from without it is my hope that some things have been said which will rouse in you a sympathetic appreciation of the kind of work which I have sought to emphasize as the most precious type of endeavor for further progress will depend largely on the appreciation and support given to this by the best elements in the medical profession The material side of our advancing civ ilization has developed during a thousand years to an astonishing degree but we must not be misled as sometimes happens into confusing material developments with intellectual progress These foundations of today are but aids to active minds that use them The mind the man is the essen tial thing and any device which does not improve him and give him the very best opportunity to increase his powers has but slight claim to our regard I desire there fore to leave with you a strong impression of the paramount importance of our mental attitude in establishing the right relations between research foundations and medicine Permit me then in closing to quote a little fable from Luqman as it seems to emphasize this point Luqman the sage was reputed I am told to have been either an Abyssinian slave of King David or the son of Jobs maternal aunt That question is not settledbut his fable has a pleasant oriental flavor It runs as follows In the heat of the day the lion retired to a cave While resting there a rat ran over him The lion jumped up in fright whereat the jackal laughed Perceiving this the lion said I was not frightened at the rat but at my own alarm thus show ing that to the mighty their state of mind is of more moment than death itself HENRY H DONALDSON FAMILY RECORDS OF GRADUATES OF WESLEYAN UNIVERSITY FAMILY RECORDS OF GRADUATES OF WESLEYAN

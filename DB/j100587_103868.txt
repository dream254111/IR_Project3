GIVE AN EASY VIEW OF THE BAROME TER AND THERMOMETER IN THE SEVERAL DISTANT PARTS OF THE WORLD SPECIFIED WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY INSTRUCTIVE HAD THEY BEEN OBSERVED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS THEY WERE AT NAPLES BY THE BAROMETRICAL OBSERVATIONS IT APPEARS THAT THE ASCENT AND DESCENT OF THE QUICKSILVER IS NOT SO GREAT AT NAPLES AS IN THE MORE NORTHERLY CLIMES FOR IT WAS BUT TWICE IN THE WHOLE YEAR ABOVE 30 INCHES AND BUT THRICE AS LOW AS 2912 INCHES AND SO IN PHILOS TRANSACT NO 321 I OBSERVED THAT AT ZURICH THE RANGE IS BUT ABOUT AN INCH BUT AT UPMINSTER I FIND THE HIGHEST ASCENT TO HAVE BEEN 3044 INCHES AND THE LOWEST DESCENT 2744 INCHES WHICH IS A RANGE OF 212 IN CHES AND BY MY ACCOUNT OF THE PETERSBURGH OB SERVATIONS IN 1724 IT APPEARS THAT THE MERCURIAL RANGE THERE IS 331 INCHES IN PHILOS TRANSACT NO 424 P 107 AND AS FOR NORWAY THE OBSER VATIONS ARE TOO FEW AND ALL MADE ONLY IN THE SUM MER MONTHS WHEREBY NO GOOD JUDGMENT COULD BE MADE AND BENGAL HAD NO BAROMETER BY THE THERMOMETRICAL TABLE WE MAY JUDGE OF THE HEAT AND COLD OF THE SEVERAL PLACES FOR THE RIGHT UNDERSTANDING OF WHICH I MUST REPEAT WHAT I SAID IN A FORMER A BRIDGMENT VIZ THAT IN MR HAUKESBEES THERMOMETERS THE POINT OF EX TREAM HEAT IS 5 DEGREES ABOVE 0 THAT 45 DEGREES BELOW 0 IS THE POINT OF TEMPERATE AND 65 DE GREES THE POINT OF FREEZING BUT DR CYRIL VIDE PHIL TRANSACT NO 429 P 336 SAITH

VE HEMENS IN JULY WHEN THE SPIRITS WERE BUT AT 36 DEGREES AND 34 DEGREES IN AUGUST AT 25 27 AND 28 DEGREES HE SAYS THE WEATHER WAS EXCEEDING HOT CAELUM CALIDISSIMUM I THUS DISTINCTLY MENTION AS THE AUTHOR DOTH THE HEAT OF THE SUN AND THE HEAT OF THE WEATHER BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT MEAN THE SAME THING I HAVING BEEN INFORMED BY THE WHALEFISHERS THAT IN GREENLAND THE HEAT OF THE SUN IS SCARCE TOLERABLE ON ONE SIDE OF THE SHIP WHEN ON THE OTHER SIDE IT FREEZES HARD AT BENGAL THE HEAT AT SOME TIMES SEEMS TO BE VERY INTENSE BY THE THERMOMETER BEING IN SOME MONTHS MORE DEGREES ABOUT THE 0 THAN THE POINT OF EXTREME HEAT IS AS PARTICULARLY IN APRIL MAY AND JUNE IT WAS 6 7 AND 8 DEGREES ABOVE 0 BUT THOSE EXCESSIVE HEATS ARE GENERALLY IN THE AFTER NOONS THE FORENOONS BEING MORE TEMPERATE AND THE TEMPERATURE OR WHAT THEY CALL COLD THERE IS AT THE SAME TIME OF THE DAY AND THE DEGREE OF THE THERMOMETER AT WHICH THEY RECKON IT COLDISH IS ABOUT409 ABOUT 15 DEGREES AND ON MAY 2D AT 8 O CLOCK IN THE MORNING MR BEILAMY SAITH THE GLALS BE ING THEN AT 204 DEGREE THE MORNING WAS LIKE WINTER WEATHER IN EUROPE WHETHER THIS SO DIFFERENT JUDGMENT OF GREAT COLD AT BENGAL WHEN THE THERMOMETER WAS ABOUT 20 DEGREES AND OF EXCESSIVE HEAT AT CHRISTIANA WHEN IT WAS BUT A LITTLE BELOW THAT VIZ AT 25 DEGREES C WHETHER I SAY THIS DIFFERENCE OF JUDGMENT ARISES FROM SOME PREJUDICE OF THE SENSES OR FROM SOME EXTRAORDINARY QUALITY IN THE AIR I LEAVE AS DR CYRIL DOTH TO THE JUDGMENT OF THE LEARNED SOCIETY AS TO THE WEATHER WINDS RAIN C OF THE SEVERAL PLACES IT WOULD BE ENDLESS TO MEDDLE WITH PARTICULARS AND THEREFORE A TRANSIENT VIEW OF EVERY MONTH MUST SUFFICE AT NAPLES JANUARY WAS A COOL MONTH FREQUENT RAIN WITH MUCH THUNDER AND STORMS OF WIND THE RAIN AMOUNTED TO 11112 MEASURES 23 OF WHICH MAKE AN ENGLISH INCH IN DEPTH WHICH IS 4 INCHES 1912 MEASURES OR NEAR 5 INCHES DEPTH VESUVIUS WAS PRETTY QUIET FEBRUARY WAS A DRIER MONTH THE RAIN AMOUNT ING ONLY TO 14 MEASURES WHICH IS BUT LITTLE ABOVE HALF AN INCH DEEP THE WEATHER WAS FOR THE MOST PART CLOUDY WITH SOME FROSTS VESUVIUS EMITTED A THICK SMOAK AT NAPLES IN MARCH IT WAS COLD WITH HAIL AND SNOW ON THE MOUNTAINS THE RAIN AMOUNTED TO 101 MEASURES WHICH MAKES 4 INCHES 9 MEASURES DEPTH THE WINDS WERE IN ALL THE POINTS VESUVIUS DIS CHARGED RIVULETS OF FIRE AT410 AT BENGAL THE FIVE LAST DAYS WHICH WERE ALL OB SERVED IN THIS MONTH WERE FAIR THE WIND S2 IN APRIL THE WINDS AT NAPLES WERE MUCH IN THE NORTHERLY POINTS COLD FREQUENT THUNDER THE RAIN ONLY 38 MEASURES WHICH MAKE 1 INCH 15 MEA SURES NO FIRE IN VESUVIUS THE BEGINNING OF THE MONTH BUT TOWARDS THE LATTER END DIVERS RIVERS OF FIRE AND SMOAK AT BENGAL THE WIND WAS MUCH AMONG THE SOUTHERLY POINTS CLOUDY SOME RAIN AND THUNDER THE WEATHER FOR THE MOST PART TEMPERATE BUT GREAT HEATS IN THE AFTERNOONS IN MAY AT NAPLES THE WIND LAY MUCH IN THE WESTERLY AND SOUTHERLY POINTS RAIN 10312 MEA SURES WHICH MAKES 4 INCHES 1112 MEASURES DEPTH WITH FREQUENT THUNDER VESUVIUS CAST OUT RIVETS OF FIRE WHICH REACHED ALMOST TO THE BOTTOM OF THE MOUNTAIN AT BENGAL THE WINDS VARYING BUT FOR THE MOST PART SOUTHERLY WITH MUCH CLOUDY RAIN AND THUNDER THE BEGINNING OF THE MONTH COLDER THAN ORDINARY AFTERWARDS EXCEEDING HOT IN JUNE AT NAPLES THE WIND WAS MUCH IN THE WESTERLY AND NORTHWESTERLY POINTS BUT LITTLE RAIN ONLY 612 MEASURES WHICH IS BUT ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN INCH DEPTH AT BENGAL MUCH RAIN WITH THUNDER AND HEAT ON JUNE 6TH IT IS NOTED WE ARE NOW PRETTY CERTAIN THE RAINS ARE SET IN AT CHRISTIANA THE OBSERVATIONS BEGIN ON JUNE 22D THE WEATHER TEMPERATE AND FOR THE MOST PART CLOUDY WITH THUNDER HAIL AND RAIN JULY411 JULY AT NAPLES WAS A VERY HOT DRY MONTH WITHOUT ANY RAIN BUT FREQUENT MISTS VESUVIUS QUIET AT BENGAL FREQUENT AND MUCH RAIN WITH THUN DER AND LIGHTENING FOR THE MOST PART CLOUDY WINDS PERPETUALLY VARYING AT CHRISTIANA GREAT RAINS WITH THUNDER FRE QUENT FOGS SOME FAIR AND COMPLAINTS OF VEHE MENT HEAT ALTHOUGH THE THERMOMETER WAS BUT AT 30 DEGREES IN THAT MONTH IN AUGUST AT NAPLES THE WIND WAS IN THE WESTERLY AND NORTHWESTERLY POINTS SHOWERS WITH THUNDER WERE FREQUENT WHICH AMOUNTED ON LY TO 4912 MEASURES WHICH IS BUT A LITTLE ABOVE 2 INCHES DEPTH AND ALTHOUGH BY THE TABLE THE WEATHER SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN WARM YET THERE ARE FRE QUENT COMPLAINTS OF THE AIR BEING COLD VESUVIUS CAST FORTH A LARGE RIVER OF FIRE AT BENGAL MUCH RAIN WITH THUNDER AND CLOUDY WINDS VARYING BUT PRETTY MUCH EASTERLY WEATHER SOMETIMES VERY HOT BUT FOR THE MOST PART MORE TEMPERATE THAN IN SOME OF THE OTHER MONTHS AT CHRISTIANA THE WINDS VARIOUS FREQUENT MISTS WITH CLOUDY AND SOMETIMES FAIR AND SOMETIMES RAIN GREAT COMPLAINTS OF HEAT ALTHOUGH BY THE THERMOMETER NO GREAT SIGNS OF IT IN SEPTEMBER AT NAPLES THE WINDS VARIOUS AND VERY STORMY TOWARDS THE LATTER END OF THE MONTH WITH HORRIBLE THUNDER LIGHTENING AND HEAVY RAIN WHICH AMOUNTED TO 22012 MEASURES MAKING 9 INCHES 1312 MEASURES IN DEPTH WHICH WAS MORE THAN FELL IN ANY MONTH OF THIS YEAR AND DROWNED THE MARSHES AND DID A GREAT DEAL OF DAMAGE TO I I I HOUSES412 HOUSES TREES C VESUVIUS WAS QUIET AT THE BE GINNING BUT FIERY AT THE END BENGAL HATH ONLY THE 7 FIRST DAYS OBSERVATIONS WHERE THE WIND WAS MOSTLY EASTERLY CLOUDY AND SHOWERY WITH THUNDER AND LIGHTENING THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE REMAINING MONTHS ARE ALL OF NAPLES WHERE IN OCTOBER THE WIND WAS VARIOUS AND SOMETIMES STORMY WITH THUNDER FREQUENT MISTS AND SOME TIMES HEAVY RAIN AMOUNTING TO 107 MEASURES WHICH MAKE 4 INCHES 15 MEASURES AND IN THE MOUN TAINS SNOW VESUVIUS TURBULENT IN THE BEGINNING OF THE MONTH AND EMITTED A RIVER OF FIRE NOVEMBER WAS FOR THE MOST PART A CLOUDY MIS LING MONTH WITH THUNDER AND RAIN BUT OF NO GREATER QUANTITY THAN 73 MEASURES WHICH ARE EQUAL TO 3 INCHES 4 MEASURES DEPTH ENGLISH THE WIND WAS MORE NORTHERLY THAN IN ANY OTHER QUARTER THE FIRE OF VESUVIUS LESS DECEMBER WAS A WETUNSEASONABLE MONTH THE RAIN BEING 179 MEASURES WHICH IS 7 INCHES 18 MEASURES IN DEPTH WHICH FOLLOWING THE RAINS AND UNSEASON ABLE WEATHER OF THE PRECEEDING MONTHS SO DAMAGED THE FRUITS OF THE EARTH THAT PUBLICK PRAYERS WERE ORDERED FOR FAIR WEATHER THE RAIN OF THE WHOLE YEAR THE ILLUSTRIOUS OB SERVER COMPUTES AT 3 ENGLISH FEET 7 INCHES AND

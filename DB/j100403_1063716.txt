THIS IS ALSO THE GENERALLY ACCEPTED DOCTRINE IN THIS COUNTRY2 BUT IN A FEW STATES IT HAS BEEN DISAPPROVED AND THE MORE REASONABLE RULE ADOPTED ALLOWING PARTNERSHIP CREDITORS TO SHARE PARI PASSU WITH INDIVIDUAL CREDITORS IN THE SEPARATE ASSETS AFTER EXHAUSTING PART NERSHIP ASSETS3 AN IMPORTANT EXCEPTION IF SOUND TO THE MAJORITY RULE ABOVE IN DICATED IS ESTABLISHED BY THE DECISION IN RE PECK4 WHERE CHASE J FOLLOWING THE DECISION IN RE BLACKFORD LAYS DOWN THE RULE THAT A CREDITOR WITH A JUDGMENT AGAINST A PARTNERSHIP FOR CONVERSION MAY SHARE PARI ASSU WITH SEPARATE CREDITORS IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE INDIVIDUAL ESTATES OF THE PARTNERS AND ALSO EQUALLY WITH PARTNERSHIP CREDITORS IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF PARTNERSHIP ASSETS HIS OPINION IS BASED ON THE GROUND THAT A TORT CLAIM AGAINST A PARTNER SHIP IS BOTH JOINT AND SEVERAL AND THEREFORE SHOULD BE GOVERNED BY THE SAME RULES GOVERNING JOINT AND SEVERAL CONTRACT CLAIMS6 THE LEARNED JUDGE FAILS TO DRAW THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE NA TURE OF A JOINT AND SEVERAL CONTRACT CLAIM AND THE PECULIAR CHAR ACTER OF A TORT CLAIM WHICH IS JOINT OR SEVERAL THIS DISTINCTION IS CLEARLY POINTED OUT BY BROWN J IN REYNOLDS V NEW YORK TRUST CO7 IN

AND SEVERAL BUT IS JOINT OR SEVERAL AT THE ELECTION OF THE PLAINTIFF THE PLAINTIFF MAY HAVE JUDGMENT AGAINST ONE OR MORE BUT HE MAY NOT HAVE TWO JUDGMENTS AGAINST THE SAME PERSON ON THE SAME TRANSACTION    A JOINT JUDGMENT IS A BAR TO A SEVERAL ACTION AND A SEVERAL JUDGMENT TO A JOINT ACTION AT LAW THEREFORE ONE WHOSE GOODS WERE CONVERTED BY PARTNERS COULD NOT HAVE BOTH A JOINT AND SEVERAL JUDGMENT BUT COULD HAVE EITHER AT HIS ELECTION    IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE PLAINTIFF SHOULD HAVE GREATER RIGHTS BEFORE JUDGMENT THAN IF IT HAD PROCEEDED TO JUDGMENT    WE ARE UNABLE TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSITION THAT JOINT TORT FEAS ORS ARE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY LIABLE IF BY THIS IS MEANT SUBJECT TO BOTH JOINT AND SEVERAL JUDGMENTS 316NOTES TREATED AS JOINT OR SEVERAL AT THE ELECTION OF

ENFORCED IN EITHER OF THE TWO WAYS BUT NOT BOTH9 A JOINT AND SEVERAL CON TRACT HOWEVER GIVES RISE TO TWO DISTINCT RIGHTS OF ACTION THERE BEING TWO SEPARATE OBLIGATIONS ONE OF THE PARTIES JOINTLY AND AN OTHER OF THE PARTIES AS INDIVIDUALS A STOCK ILLUSTRATION OF THIS IS WHERE ONE OF SEVERAL PARTNERS BECOMES SURETY ON A PARTNERSHIP NOTE HE THEREBY INCURS A JOINT LIABILITY AS A MEMBER OF THE PART NERSHIP AND A SEPARATE LIABILITY BY REASON OF HIS INDIVIDUAL UNDER TAKING OF SURETYSHIP10 IN SUCH CASE SINCE THERE ARE TWO DISTINCT RIGHTS BOTH MAY BE ENFORCED AND IT FOLLOWS AS A MATTER OF COURSE THAT BOTH MAY BE PROVEDONE AGAINST THE PARTNERSHIP ESTATE AND THE OTHER AGAINST THE INDIVIDUAL ESTATE OF THE SURETY WHILE IT IS TRUE THAT UPON A JOINT JUDGMENT AGAINST SEVERAL PERSONS FOR A TORT EXECUTION MAY BE ISSUED AGAINST AND SATISFACTION HAD FROM ANY ONE ALL OR ANY INTERMEDIATE NUMBER IL1 YET THIS DOES NOT GIVE SEPARATE RIGHTS IT IS MERELY A MATTER OF REMEDY IN THIS RESPECT IT IS NOT UNLIKE A JUDGMENT OBTAINED ON AN ORDINARY CONTRACT CLAIM AGAINST A PARTNERSHIP WHICH IS IN ITS NATURE ALWAYS JOINT12 IT IS FOR THE DEALING WITH JUST SUCH CLAIMS THAT THE RULE OF MARSHALLING GIVING PRIORITY TO INDIVIDUAL CREDITORS OVER PARTNERSHIP CREDITORS IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF SEPARATE ASSETS WAS ESTABLISHED IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE DOCTRINE ENUNCIATED BY THE DECISION OF RE PECK SUPRA IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE BEST REASONING AND THERE FORE SHOULD NOT ESTABLISH AN EXCEPTION TO THE GENERAL RULE OF MAR SHALLING SEPARATE ASSETS IN SUCH CASES BUT THAT THE OPINION IN REY NOLDS V NEWV YORK TRUST CO SUPRA CORRECTLY STATES THE LAW UPON FIRST SIGHT IT MAY SEEM POSSIBLE TO RECONCILE THESE TWO CASES THE FORMER INVOLVING A TORT ACTION FOR CONVERSION WHILE IN THE LAT TER THE TORT IS WAIVED AND ACTION BROUGHT IN ASSUMPSIT ON QUASI CONTRACT IT WILL READILY BE SEEN HOWEVER THAT THIS DISTINCTION COULD NOT AFFECT THE CONCLUSION THE DECISION OF THE POINT WHICH UNDOUBTEDLY IS THE SAME IN BOTH CASES RESTS UPON A QUESTION OF LEGAL RIGHTS13 AND SUCH RIGHTS SHOULD NOT BE AFFECTED BY THE NATURE OF THE REMEDY PAROL CONTEMPORANEOUS WAIVER IN INSURANCEPERHAPS NO BRANCH OF LAW PRESENTS MORE

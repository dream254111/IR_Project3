j100403,Virginia Law Review,1063716,Nature of the Liability of Individual Partners for Partnership Torts,i243786,NOTES Studley Case this additional element was not present and the dis tinction is all important The Massey Case and the Studley Case are the two leading cases on the topic under discussion and the foundation of all the de cisions though there is some dissent among the authorities The Ernst Case completes the range of the authorities and is typical of that group of cases the facts of which present all the elements of a voidable preference16 The discussion gives rise to an interesting case where the depos itor is not indebted to the bank except on an overdrawn account The debtor while insolvent and within the four months period deposits in the usual course of business a sufficient sum to cover the overdraft Upon a subsequent adjudication will the bank be compelled to surrender the amount deposited as a preference un der  60b It seems there should be no distinction between this case and those cases discussed above where the bank held an over due note The same reasons apply and the result should not be different17 NATURE OF THE LIABILITY OF INDIVIDUAL PARTNERS FOR PART NERSHIP TORTSIt is a well settled rule in England that upon administration in court of partnership estates and estates of the individual partners the individual creditors are preferred over

10 ILL LAW REV 602 610 it was said The facts of the Studley Case square with the principal case in all essential points except that the bank receiving the checks in the Studley Case did not have reason to believe etc This element as we think presents a fatal distinction The precise point here under discussion was decided a few months earlier than the principal case by the Supreme Court of Penn sylvania with a contrary conclusion in Knoll v Commercial Trust Co 94 Atl 750 35 A B R 379 Apr 1915 The Pennsylvania court bases its conclusion on Traders Bank v Campbell 81 U S 14 Wall 87 which arose under the statute of 1867 and finds the rule there stated concordant with the rule of the Studley case the element of knowledge being the decisive factor In Traders Bank v Campbell 81 U S 14 Wall 87 the transaction presented all the elements of a voidable pref erence This case is distinguished in the Massey Case and followed by In re Starkweather  Albert D C 206 Fed 797 where the circum

This is also the generally accepted doctrine in this country2 but in a few states it has been disapproved and the more reasonable rule adopted allowing partnership creditors to share pari passu with individual creditors in the separate assets after exhausting part nership assets3 An important exception if sound to the majority rule above in dicated is established by the decision in Re Peck4 where Chase J following the decision in Re Blackford lays down the rule that a creditor with a judgment against a partnership for conversion may share pari assu with separate creditors in the distribution of the individual estates of the partners and also equally with partnership creditors in the distribution of partnership assets His opinion is based on the ground that a tort claim against a partner ship is both joint and several and therefore should be governed by the same rules governing joint and several contract claims6 The learned judge fails to draw the distinction between the na ture of a joint and several contract claim and the peculiar char acter of a tort claim which is joint or several This distinction is clearly pointed out by Brown J in Reynolds v New York Trust Co7 in considering precisely the same point but arriving at a di rectly opposite conclusion A tort committed by several may be Ex parte Elton 3 Ves Jun 238 See Lodge v Prichard 1 De G   S 610  Murrill v

A N S 1223 35 App Div 330 54 N Y Supp 972  Chase J quotes at great length from the opinion in Re Blackford infra In considering this subject he quotes Nor do we see that the liability of joint tort feasors is different from that of parties to a con tract by which under its express terms they become jointly and sev erally bound This seems to be the basis of his decision the double proof of joint and several contract claims being conceded as an estab lished legal principle  110 C C A 409 188 Fed 611 26 A B R 698 where Brown J says The liability of one of several tort feasors is not both joint and several but is joint or several at the election of the plaintiff The plaintiff may have judgment against one or more but he may not have two judgments against the same person on the same transaction    A joint judgment is a bar to a several action and a several judgment to a joint action At law therefore one whose goods were converted by partners could not have both a joint and several judgment but could have either at his election    It seems impossible that the plaintiff should have greater rights before judgment than if it had proceeded to judgment    we are unable to accept the proposition that joint tort feas ors are jointly and severally liable if by this is meant subject to both joint and several judgments 316NOTES treated as joint or several at the election of the plaintiff but he can obtain only one judgment against any defendant A joint judgment is a bar to a several action and a several judgment to a joint action There is but one right which may be enforced in either of the two ways but not both9 A joint and several con tract however gives rise to two distinct rights of action there being two separate obligations one of the parties jointly and an other of the parties as individuals A stock illustration of this is where one of several partners becomes surety on a partnership note He thereby incurs a joint liability as a member of the part nership and a separate liability by reason of his individual under taking of suretyship10 In such case since there are two distinct rights both may be enforced and it follows as a matter of course that both may be provedone against the partnership estate and the other against the individual estate of the surety While it is true that upon a joint judgment against several persons for a tort execution may be issued against and satisfaction had from any one all or any intermediate number il1 yet this does not give separate rights it is merely a matter of remedy In this respect it is not unlike a judgment obtained on an ordinary contract claim against a partnership which is in its nature always joint12 It is for the dealing with just such claims that the rule of marshalling giving priority to individual creditors over partnership creditors in the distribution of separate assets was established It is believed that the doctrine enunciated by the decision of Re Peck supra is not consistent with the best reasoning and there fore should not establish an exception to the general rule of mar shalling separate assets in such cases but that the opinion in Rey nolds v Newv York Trust Co supra correctly states the law Upon first sight it may seem possible to reconcile these two cases the former involving a tort action for conversion while in the lat ter the tort is waived and action brought in assumpsit on quasi contract It will readily be seen however that this distinction could not affect the conclusion The decision of the point which undoubtedly is the same in both cases rests upon a question of legal rights13 and such rights should not be affected by the nature of the remedy PAROL CONTEMPORANEOUS WAIVER IN INSURANCEPerhaps no branch of law presents more hopeless confusion and conflict  Atlantic  Pacific R v Laird 164 U S 393 See Sessions v John son 95 U S 347  Reynolds v New York Trust Co supra 10 Wilder v Keeler 3 Paige Ch N Y 167 23 Am Dec 781 See

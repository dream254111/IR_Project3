PRINGLE BART P R S NATURALEM CAUSAM QUAERIMUS ET ASSIDUAM NON RARAM ET FORTUITAM SEN NAT QUAEST L II C 55 HAVING HAD SOME SATISFACTION IN THE DISCOVERY OF TWO GROUPS OF PRISMATIC BASALTINE COLUMNS IN THE VENETIAN STATE IN ITALY I THOUGHT THAT AN ACCOUNT OF THEM MIGHT POSSIBLY PROVE ACCEPTABLE TO YOU SIR AND TO THE OTHER LEARNED MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY I THEREFORE TAKE THE LIBERTY OF TRANSMIT TING TO YOU THE PRESENT TOGETHER WITH ACCURATE DRAWINGS OF THESE CAUSEWAYS REQUESTING OF YOU TO COMMUNICATE THEM TO THE GENTLEMEN OF THE SOCIETY SHOULD YOU THINK THEY MERIT THEIR ATTENTION I SHALL FIRST BRIEFLY EXPLAIN 3 THE REDDE NOV 24 17746 THE TWO DRAWINGS AND THEN ADD SUCH OBSERVATIONS AS HAVE OCCURRED TO ME UPON CONSIDERING MORE PARTICULAR LY THE CURIOUS ORIGINALS WHICH THEY REPRESENT N 1 IS A TOPOGRAPHICAL VIEW OF A PART OF THE SOUTH EAST SIDE OF A HILL CALLED MONTE ROSSO ABOUT SEVEN MILES DISTANT NEARLY SOUTH FROM PADUA IN THE VENETIAN STATE IN ITALY AND A MILE TO THE WEST OF ABANO A VILLAGE WELL KNOWN FROM THE CELEBRATED HOT BATHS OF THAT NAME AND WHICH ARE SITUATED AT HALF A MILES DISTANCE TO THE SOUTH OF IT THIS VIEW PARTICULARLY REPRESENTS A NATURAL RANGE OF PRISMATIC COLUMNS OF DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIZES WHICH ARE PLACED IN A DIRECTION NEARLY PERPENDICULAR TO THE HO RIZON AND PARALLEL TO EACH OTHER MUCH RESEMBLING THAT PART OF THE FAMOUS GIANTS CAUSEWAY IN IRELAND CALLED THE ORGANS AS MAY BE SEEN AT FIG 2 IN THE WEST PROS PECT OF THAT CAUSEWAY ENGRAVED BY VIVARES AFTER ONE OF MRS S DRURYS EXCELLENT DESIGNS N 2 IS A SIMILAR REPRESENTATION OF THE WEST SIDE OF ANOTHER BASALTINE HILL CALLED IL MONTE DEL DIAVOLO OR THE DEVILS HILL NEAR SAN GIOVANNI ILLARIONE ALSO IN THE VENETIAN STATE AND VERONESE DISTRICT ABOUT TEN MILES NEARLY NORTHWEST OF VICENZA THE PRISMATIC COLUMNS APPEAR TO BE RANGED IN AN OBLIQUE POSITION ALONG THE SIDE OF THE HILL NOT UNLIKE THE GROUP REPRESENTED UNDER THE ROCK MARKED FIG 9 IN MRS DRURYS WEST PROSPECT OF THE GIANTS CAUSEWAY THIS DRAWING HOWEVER REPRESENTS ONLY A PART OF THE CAUSE WAY OF SAN GIOVANNI WHICH CONTINUES ALONG THE SIDE OF A VALLEY NEARLY IN THE SAME MANNER TO A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCEPHILOS TRANS VOL LXV TABI TABI  67 DISTANCE THOUGH THE COLUMNS OF BOTH THESE HILLS ARE OF THE SIMPLE OR UNJOINTED SPECIES CORNEUS CRYSTALLISATUS PRISMATICUS LATERIBUS INORDINATIS WALLERII YET THEY DIF FER VERY REMARKABLY FROM EACH OTHER IN MANY RESPECTS BUT PRINCIPALLY IN THEIR FORMS AND THE TEXTURE AND QUA LITY OF THEIR PARTS THOSE OF SAN GIOVANNI COMMONLY AP PROACH A CIRCULAR FORM AS NEARLY AS THEIR ANGLES WILL PER MIT WHICH IS ALSO OBSERVABLE IN THE COLUMNS OF THE GI ANTS CAUSEWAY AND OF MOST OTHER BASALTINE GROUPS ON THE CONTRARY THOSE OF MONTE ROSSO RATHER AFFECT AN OB LONG OR OVAL FIGURE AS MAY BE MORE PARTICULARLY OBSERV ED IN THE ANNEXED REPRESENTATION OF ONE OF THEMA THE COLUMNS OF SAN GIOVANNI MEASURE ONE WITH THE OTHER NEAR A FOOT IN DIAMETER NOR DO THEY VARY MUCH IN THEIR SIZE THOUGH THIS IS OFTEN THE CASE IN SIMILAR GROUPS AND IS PARTICULARLY OBSERVABLE IN THAT OF MONTE ROSSO WHOSE COLUMNS SOMETIMES EQUAL NEARLY A FOOT IN DIAME TER WHILE OTHERS SCARCELY EXCEED THREE INCHES THE COM MON WIDTH OF THEM IS ABOUT SIX OR EIGHT INCHES THEY DIFFER THEREFORE VERY CONSIDERABLY IN SIZE FROM THOSE OF THE GIANTS CAUSEWAY SOME OF WHICH AS IS WELL KNOWN MEASURE TWO FEET IN WIDTH I CAN SAY NOTHING CERTAIN CONCERNING THE LENGTH OF THE COLUMNS OF SAN GIOVANNI SINCE THEY PRESENT ONLY THEIR TOPS TO VIEW THE REMAINING PARTS OF THEM BEING DEEPLY BURIED IN THE HILL AND IN SOME PLACES INTIRELY COVERED AS MAY BE SEEN IN THE DRAWING THE COLUMNS OF MONTE ROSSO AS FAR AS THEY ARE VISIBLE MEASURE ONLY FROM SIX TO EIGHT OR TEN FEET IN HEIGHT A FIG 1 WHICH8 WHICH IS ALSO A SMALL SIZE WHEN COMPARED WITH THE HEIGHT OF THOSE OF THE GIANTS CAUSEWAY SOME OF WHICH MEASURE NEAR FORTY FEET THE COLUMNS OF THE VENETIAN GROUPS MANIFEST HOWEVER ALL THE VARIETIES OF PRISMATIC FORMS THAT ARE OBSERVABLE IN THOSE OF THE GIANTS CAUSEWAY AND OTHER SIMILAR GROUPS BUT THEY ARE COMMONLY EITHER OF FIVE SIX OR SEVEN SIDES AND THE HEXAGONAL FORM SEEMS MOSTLY TO PREVAIL WHICH IF I MISTAKE NOT IS ALSO REMARK ABLE IN THE GIANTS CAUSEWAY AND AS I BELIEVE IN MOST OTHERS NOR IS THERE LESS DIFFERENCE IN THE TEXTURE AND QUALITIES OF THESE COLUMNS THAN IN THEIR FORMS THOSE OF SAN GIOVANNI PRESENT A SMOOTH SURFACE AND WHEN BROKEN APPEAR WITHIN OF A DARK IRON GREY COLOUR MANI FESTING ALSO A VERY SOLID AND UNIFORM TEXTURE IN WHICH CHARACTERS THEY CORRESPOND WITH THE COLUMNS OF THE GI ANTS CAUSEWAY AND THOSE OF MOST OTHER BASALTINE GROUPS BUT THE COLUMNS OF MONTE ROSSO ARE VERY DIFFERENT IN ALL THESE RESPECTS FOR THEY HAVE NOT ONLY A VERY ROUGH AND SOMETIMES KNOTTY SURFACE BUT WHEN BROKEN MANIFEST A VARIEGATED COLOUR AND UNEQUAL TEXTURE OF PARTS I HAVE BROKEN SEVERAL AND HAVE CONSTANTLY FOUND THEM OF THIS HETEROGENEOUS CHARACTER AND CONCLUDE THAT THE REST ARE AS USUAL OF THE SAME NOR DO I APPREHEND THAT AMONG THE WHOLE THERE IS A SINGLE COLUMN OF AN UNIFORM COLOUR AND TEXTURE LIKE THOSE OF MOST OTHER GROUPS THEY ARE COMMONLY SPECKLED AS IT WERE MORE OR LESS DISTINCTLY AND RESEMBLE AN INFERIOR SORT OF GRANITE OF WHICH MONTE ROSSO ITSELF IS FORMED AND WHICH SERVES AS A BASE TO THE RANGE OF COLUMNS IN QUESTION IT IS IN GENERAL NOT QUITE SOPHILOS TRANS VOLLXV TABIIS9 SO HARD AS THE ALPINE AND ORIENTAL GRANITES AND IS SOME TIMES EVEN FRIABLE LIKE THE SAXUM GRANITES PARTICULIS PA RUM ADHAERENTIBUS ANON MIN 270 N 1 OR SAXUM MICACEUM QUARTZOSUM SPATOSUMQUE SUBFRIABILE LINN SYST NAT TOM III P 76 EDIT HOLMIAE 1768 LINNAEUS JUSTLY OBSERVES THAT THIS SPECIES OF GRANITE ABOUNDS IN FRANCE FOR I HAVE LATELY SEEN LARGE TRACTS OF IT IN THE NEIGHBOUR ING PROVINCES OF AUVERGNE VELAY AND LIONNOIS AND APPREHEND THAT IT LIKEWISE ABOUNDS IN THE VIVAREY GE VAUDAN AND SEVENNES MOUNTAINS FROM THE AFFINITY OB SERVABLE IN THE PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY OF THOSE COUNTRIES BUT IT IS EQUALLY COMMON IN ITALY FOR BESIDES MONTE ROSSO THE BULK OF THE EUGANEAN HILLS IN GENERAL OF WHICH THAT IS A PART PRINCIPALLY CONSISTS OF IT AND THESE HILLS OC CUPY A CONSIDERABLE TRACT IN THE PLAINS OF LOMBARDY IT IS ALSO COMMON IN THE TUSCAN AND ROMAN STATES THE MOUNTAIN CLOSE TO VITERBO ON THE ROAD TO ROME IS IN TIRELY COMPOSED OF IT THE ITALIANS CALL IT GRANITELLO AND IT MUCH RESEMBLES THE LAPIS VARIOLATUS DESCRIBED BY ALDROVANDUS IN HIS MUSEUM METALLICUM THOUGH PARTIAL SPOTS OF THIS GRANITE ARE OFTEN FRIABLE ESPECIALLY ABOUT THE SURFACE YET IN GENERAL IT IS VERY HARD INSO MUCH THAT M GUETTARD COMPARES THE GRANITES OF FRANCE WITH THOSE OF EGPYTB THE COLUMNS OF MONTE ROSSO APPEAR THEREFORE OF A DIFFERENT CHARACTER FROM ANY HITHERTO DESCRIBED BY MINERALOGISTS WHO ONLY MENTION THOSE OF AN UNIFORM COLOUR AND TEXTURE IT HAS BEEN B MEMOIRES DE LACAD POUR 1751 VOL LXV C OBSERVED10 OBSERVED THAT THE MASS OF STONE IN THE HILL ABOVE THE GIANTS CAUSEWAY PORTIONS OF WHICH ARE REPRESENTED AT FIG 9 IN MRS DRURYS WEST PROSPECT IS OF THE SAME QUALITY AND TEXTURE WITH THE COLUMNS THEMSELVES WHICH AFFINITY I HAVE CONSTANTLY OBSERVED BETWEEN OTHER SIMI LAR BASALTINE GROUPS AND THE MASSES TO WHICH THEY BE LONG IT IS NOT THEREFORE EXTRAORDINARY THAT THE SAME SHOULD ALSO BE OBSERVABLE BETWEEN THE COLUMNS OF MONTE ROSSO AND THE SORT OF GRANITE ROCK ON WHICH THEY STAND AND WITH WHICH THEY SEEM IN A MANNER INTIMATELY CON NECTED FOR IT IS FURTHER REMARKABLE THAT THE MASSES OR STRATA OF THIS GRANITE THOUGH IRREGULAR ARE YET RANGED NEARLY IN THE SAME DIRECTION WITH THE COLUMNS ABOVE THEM AS MAY BE OBSERVED IF I MISTAKE NOT EVEN IN THE DRAWING BUT THE GREAT SINGULARITY HERE IS THAT SUCH A RANGE OF PRISMATIC COLUMNS SHOULD BE FOUND BEDDED AS IT WERE IN A MASS OF GRANITE AND COMPOSED NEARLY OF THE SAME SUBSTANCE OF WHICH I NEVER YET SAW OR HEARD ANY OTHER INSTANCE THIS CIRCUMSTANCE SEEMS THEREFORE TO REN DER THE CAUSEWAY OF MONTE ROSSO MORE CURIOUS AND SIN GULAR THAN THE FAMOUS ONE IN IRELAND IS KNOWN TO BE FROM THE REGULAR ARTICULATION OF ITS COLUMNS THE SAME PHAENOMENON HAVING LATELY BEEN DISCOVERED AT STAFFA ONE OF THE WESTERN ISLANDS OF SCOTLAND DIFFERENT GROUPS OF AR TICULATED BASALTINE COLUMNS HAVE LIKEWISE BEEN OBSERVED IN THE PROVINCE OF AUVERGNE IN FRANCE PARTICULARLY BY M BEOST DE VARENNESC AT BLAUD NEAR LANGEAC AND C SAGE ELEMENS DE MINERALOGIE DOCIMASTIQUE PARIS 1772 8VO BY11 BY M DESMARESTS NEAR LE MONT DORD M SAGE ALSO MENTIONS ANOTHER NEAR ST ALCON IN THE SAME PROVINCE THE MONTE ROSSO GROUP IS HOWEVER NOT ONLY CURIOUS IN ITSELF BUT VERY INTERESTING ON ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT LIGHT IT SEEMS TO THROW UPON THE ORIGIN OF GRANITES IN GENERAL AS I SHALL HAVE OCCASION TO OBSERVE MORE PARTICULARLY HERE AFTER IT IS REMARKABLE THAT THE COLUMNS IN THE TWO DIF FERENT GROUPS OF MONTE ROSSO AND SAN GIOVANNI PRESERVE RESPECTIVELY THE SAME POSITION NEARLY PARALLEL ONE WITH THE OTHER WHICH IS NOT COMMONLY THE CASE IN OTHER BASAL TINE GROUPS FOR THOUGH THE PRINCIPAL AGGREGATE WHICH FORMS THE GIANTS CAUSEWAY STANDS IN A DIRECTION PERPEN DICULAR TO THE HORIZON YET OTHER SMALL DETACHED GROUPS OF COLUMNS ALSO APPEAR IN THE HILL ABOVE THAT AFFECT BY THEIR POSITION DIFFERENT DEGREES OF OBLIQUITY AMONG THE NUMEROUS BASALTINE HILLS OF AUVERGNE AND VELAY IN FRANCE MANY OF WHICH I HAVE LATELY VISITED AND WHICH SEEM TO ABOUND IN THOSE PROVINCES MORE THAN IN ANY OTHER PART OF EUROPE AND PERHAPS OF THE KNOWN GLOBE NOTHING IS MORE COMMON THAN TO SEE THE COLUMNS OF THE SAME GROUP LYING IN ALL POSSIBLE DIRECTIONS AS IRREGULARLY ALMOST AS THE PRISMS IN A MASS OF COMMON CRYSTAL NOR IS THIS VARIETY OF POSITION SO OBSERVABLE IN SINGLE COLUMNS AS IN WHOLE MASSES OR RANGES OF THEM WHICH OFTEN PRE SENT THEMSELVES IN THE SAME HILL DISPOSED IN DIFFERENT STRATA OR STAGES AS IT WERE ONE ABOVE THE OTHER MANY OF WHICH AFFECT VERY DIFFERENT AND EVEN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS D DE ROME DELISLE ESSAI DE CRISTALLOGRAPHIE PARIS 8VO INFERRED1INFERRED772 C 2 THUS12 THUS FOR INSTANCE I HAVE OFTEN SEEN A RANGE OF HORIZON TAL COLUMNS PLACED AGAINST ANOTHER IN WHICH ALL HAVE APPEARED PERPENDICULAR WHILE A THIRD MASS ADHERENT TO ONE OR OTHER OF THE FORMER AND PERHAPS TO BOTH HAS PRE SENTED ITSELF WITH ITS COLUMNS OBLIQUELY DISPOSED IT AP PEARS THEN THAT A PERPENDICULAR POSITION WITH RESPECT TO THE HORIZON IS BY NO MEANS A CHARACTERISTIC PECULIAR TO BASALTINE CRYSTALLIZATIONS AS HATH BEEN COMMONLY PRE TENDED ON THE CONTRARY WHOLE GROUPS FREQUENTLY OCCUR THAT EXCLUSIVELY AFFECT PARTICULAR DEGREES OF OBLIQUITY AS IS EVIDENT IN THOSE OF MONTE ROSSO SAN GIOVANNI AND MANY OTHERS NOR IS EVEN THE HORIZONTAL POSITION THOUGH LESS COMMON TO BE EXCLUDED AS I HAVE JUST OBSERVED THOUGH I HAVE NEVER YET SEEN AN ENTIRE GROUP OF COLUMNS SO DISPOSED SUCH A GROUP MAY HOWEVER POSSIBLY BE FOUND AMONG THE GREAT VARIETY OF SIMILAR PHAENOMENA WHICH THOSE CURIOUS AND MOST INTERESTING PROVINCES OF AUVERGNE AND VELAY PRESENT TO OUR NOTICE THE CO LUMNS OF SAN GIOVANNI SEEM BEDDED IN A KIND OF VUL CANIC SAND WHICH IN MANY PARTS OF THE HILL INTIRELY COVERS THEM NOR DO I RECOLLECT WHETHER ANY OTHER SO LID MASSES APPEAR BESIDES THE COLUMNS THESE HOWEVER PROBABLY REST AT BOTTOM UPON A BASE OF BASALTINE ROCK OF THE SAME NATURE NOTHING IS MORE COMMON IN THE PRO VINCES OF FRANCE JUST MENTIONED THAN TO SEE ISOLATED BA SALTINE HILLS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY COMPOSED OF DIFFERENT LAY ERS OF COLUMNS WHICH PRESENT THEMSELVES IN STAGES ONE ABOVE THE OTHER OFTEN WITHOUT ANY OTHER STRATUM BE TWEEN THEM RESEMBLING IN SOME MEASURE SI MAGNA LICET COMPONER13 COMPONERE PARVIS A HUGE PILE OR STACK OF CLEFT WOOD THOUGH I DO NOT MEAN TO ENGROSS THIS PAPER WITH MY OBSERVATIONS ON THE AUVERGNE AND VELAY BASALTES WHICH I SHALL REFER TO A FUTURE OCCASION YET I CANNOT QUIT THE SUBJECT WITHOUT ADDING A FEW PARTICULAR REMARKS THAT IMMEDIATELY CONCERN THE PRESENT INQUIRY THOUGH THE COLUMNAR CRYSTALLIZATION OF MONTE ROSSO IS THE ONLY ONE I HAVE YET SEEN OR HEARD OF IN A MASS OF GRANITE YET OTHER GROUPS OF COLUMNS HAVE OCCURRED TO ME IN OTHER PARTS THAT ARE EQUALLY OF A HETEROGENEOUS SUBSTANCE OR TEXTURE THOUGH DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF MONTE ROSSO AS WELL AS FROM THE COMMON BASALTES BUT I SHALL MEN TION ONLY ONE INSTANCE AS THE MOST PERTINENT TO MY PRE SENT SUBJECT IN THE BASALTINE HILL CALLED LES RAMEAUX NEAR IFENCHAUX IN VELAY BY THEIR FORM SURFACE IN TERNAL COLOUR AND TEXTURE THE COLUMNS OF THIS HILL PAR TAKE OF THE CHARACTERS BOTH OF THE COMMON BASALTINE CO LUMNS AND OF THOSE OF MONTE ROSSO BEFORE DESCRIBED THEY APPROACH NEARER TO THE SUBOVAL THAN THE CIRCULAR FORM THEIR SURFACE IS ROUGH THOUGH NOT KNOTTY AND THOUGH THEY RATHER INCLINE TOWARDS THE DARK COLOUR AND HARD UNIFORM SUBSTANCE AS USUAL YET ON BREAKING SEVE RAL I FOUND THEM UNEQUAL BOTH IN COLOUR AND TEXTURE AND SOMETIMES INTERSPERSED WITH IRREGULAR PIECES OR PATCHES AS IT WERE OF A HETEROGENEOUS HARD SUBSTANCE WHICH BY ITS MICAE AND SMALL RHOMBOIDAL CRYSTALLIZA TIONS MUCH RESEMBLES A SORT OF GRANITE I HAVE FREQUENTLY SEEN THE MASS ON WHICH THESE COLUMNS STAND IS OF THE SAME MIXED CHARACTER AND TOWARDS THE BASE OF THE HILL A GRANITE14 A GRANITE PREDOMINATES OF THE SAME NATURE WITH THAT OB SERVED IN THE COLUMNS IT IS ALSO REMARKABLE THAT GRA NITE IN GENERAL THROUGHOUT VELAY AND THE NEIGHBOURING PROVINCE OF AUVERGNE IS FREQUENTLY INTERMIXED WITH THE BASALTINE AND OTHER COMMON VULCANIC HILLS I HAVE OB SERVED THE SAME IN ITALY PARTICULARLY IN THE EUGANEAN HILLS NEAR PADUA AND ON THE CONFINES OF THE ROMAN WITH THE TUSCAN STATE ABOUT VITERBO BOLSANO C WHICH TRACTS ARE ALSO MOSTLY VULCANIC THE MOUNTAIN OF RADICO FANI AND ITS ENVIRONS WITH THOSE OF AQUAPENDENTE ARE CHIEFLY OF THE SAME CHARACTER AND NEAR THE LAKE OF BOL SANO BY THE ROAD SIDE LEADING TO VITERBO IS THE GROUP OF PRISMATIC BASALTINE COLUMNS DESCRIBED BY KIRCHER IN HIS MUNDUS SUBTERRANEUSE AND WHICH IS THE ONLY ONE IN ITA LY KNOWN TO ME BESIDES THOSE OF THE VENETIAN STATE BUT THE PROFUSION OF BASALTINE PHAENOMENA IN THE PROVINCES OF AUVERGNE AND VELAY IS REALLY SURPRIZING IN A MORN INGS RIDE OF ABOUT A DOZEN OR FIFTEEN MILES ROUND ISEN CHAUX WHICH IS THE CENTER OF THE VELAY BASALTES I COUNTED TWELVE DISTINCT GROUPS OF COLUMNS IN SO MANY DIFFERENT HILLS DETACHED AND AT A DISTANCE FROM EACH OTHER AND AS THESE PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO MY VIEW ACCIDENTALLY WITH OUT GOING OUT OF THE WAY IN SEARCH OF THEM IT IS TO BE PRE SUMED THAT MANY OTHERS IN THE SAME NEIGHBOURHOOD PROBABLY ESCAPED ME THEY ALSO ABOUND ABOUT PUY THE CAPITAL OF VELAY AND STILL MORE SO THROUGHOUT ALL AU VERGNE NOR IS IT MERELY A CHURCH A CASTLE OR PERHAPS A VILLAGE AS IN OTHER COUNTRIES THAT SOMETIMES CROWNS E LIB VIII SECT 1 C 9 C THE15 THE BASALTINE HILLS OF AUVERGNE AND VELAY WHOLE CITIES ARE BUILT UPON THEM A REMARKABLE INSTANCE OF WHICH AMONG OTHERS OCCURS IN THE EPISCOPAL CITY OF ST FLOUR IN UPPER AUVERGNE WHICH COVERS THE SUMMIT OF A BASALTINE HILL AND BOASTS A GIANTS CAUSEWAY FOR ITS FOUNDATION THIS IS MORE PARTICULARLY SEEN AT THE SOUTHEAST CORNER OF THE HILL ABOVE THE BRIDGE AND ON THE OUTSIDE UNDER THE WALL OF THE TOWN WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES I MENTION IN CASE THE SAME CURIOSITY SHOULD EVER LEAD ANY OTHER TRAVELLER INTO THOSE PARTS AS ST FLOUR IS CONFINED TO THE ISOLATED SUMMIT OF A HILL AND IS VERY CLOSELY BUILT THE CIRCUMFE RENCE OF THE WALLS SCARCELY EXCEEDS MUCH ABOVE A MILE BUT THE SAME CAUSEWAY CONTINUES FROM UNDER THE TOWN ON THE NORTH SIDE TO A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE THROUGH THE REMAINING LOWER PART OF THE SAME HILL UPON WHICH THE HOSPITAL OF THE TOWN IS BUILT UNDER THIS HOSPITAL TO THE WEST AND BY THE SIDE OF A ROAD LEADING DOWN INTO THE VALLEY FROM THE TOWN THE CAUSEWAY IS QUITE OPEN TO VIEW FOR A GREAT EXTENT PRESENTING THE MOST CONSIDERABLE SUIT OR CONTINUED RANGE OF HIGH COLUMNS THAT I SAW THROUGH OUT THE WHOLE TOUR INCLUDING THE CONTINUATION OF THIS CAUSEWAY UNDER THE TOWN AND THE REMAINING PART OF THE HILL IT FORMS AN AGGREGATE OF COLUMNS WHICH FOR EXTENT AND IMPORTANCE MAY ALMOST BE COMPARED WITH THE FA MOUS GIANTS CAUSEWAY IN IRELAND WITH THIS SIGNAL AD VANTAGE IN FAVOUR OF THE AUVERGNE GROUP THAT IT AFFORDS THE FOUNDATION TO A CONSIDERABLE CITY THE COLUMNS OF ST FLOUR DIFFER ALSO FROM ANY I HAVE YET SEEN AMONG OTHER SINGULARITIES WHICH I SHALL NOT CONSIDER AT PRESENT I OBSERVED16 I OBSERVED THAT THEIR SHAFTS THOUGH OF THE USUAL PRISMA TIC FORM ARE NEVERTHELESS SOMETIMES WREATHED OR TWISTED LIKE THE ARTIFICIAL ROUND AND SPIRAL COLUMNS THAT ARE OF TEN THOUGH BARBAROUSLY INTRODUCED IN BUILDINGS THE SUBSTANCE OF THESE COLUMNS IS HOWEVER OF THE COMMON SORT LIKE THAT OF THE COLUMNS OF SAN GIOVANNI AND THE GIANTS CAUSEWAY THE TOWN OF CHILLAC A FEW MILES ABOVE OLD BRIOUDE ON THE RIVER ALLIER IN UPPER AUVERGNE IS ALSO BUILT ON A GIANTS CAUSEWAY CONSISTING OF HIGH STRAIT BUT UNJOINTED COLUMNS WHICH ARE OPEN TO VIEW TOWARDS THE RIVER BUT I SHALL GIVE NO FURTHER INSTANCES OF THIS KIND AT PRESENT ONLY MUST BEG LEAVE TO OBSERVE BEFORE I QUIT THE SUBJECT OF PRISMATIC COLUMNS THAT ALTHOUGH NO GROUP OF THEM HAS HITHERTO BEEN DISCOVERED IN OUR ISLAND YET I AM PERSUADED THAT THE MOUNTAINS OF WALES CONTAIN ONE HAVING IN MY TOUR OF THAT COUNTRY OB SERVED SEVERAL LARGE PIECES OF SUCH COLUMNS AT TOWEN ON THE SEA COAST OF MERIONETHSHIRE NOT FAR FROM DOLGEL THY PARTICULARLY ABOUT TOWEN CHURCHYARD WHERE THEY ARE USED AS POSTS I COULD NOT LEARN FROM WHENCE THEY CAME BUT SHOULD SUSPECT FROM THE CHARACTER OF THE ADJA CENT COUNTRY THAT THEY ARE FOUND IN THE MOUNTAINS TO WARDS DOLGELTHY AND PROBABLY SOMEWHERE ABOUT THE FA MOUS CADER IDRIS FOR I AFTERWARDS OBSERVED IN MY AS CENT OF THAT MOUNTAIN FROM DOLGELTHY THAT ITS PREDO MINANT MASS APPEARED TO BE A SORT OF VITRIFIABLE STONE SEEMINGLY OF IGNEOUS ORIGIN AND WHICH I SHALL HERE TAKE OCCASION TO OBSERVE GREATLY PREVAILS IN NORTH WALES PAR TICULARLY IN THE THREE ALPINE COUNTIES OF MERIONETH MONTGOMERY AND CARNARVON HAVING17 HAVING DWELT A LITTLE UPON THE SUBJECT OF BASALTINE ORGA NIZATION I SHALL BEG LEAVE TO ADD A FEW REMARKS CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF THESE BODIES THE SYSTEMATICAL MINERALOGISTS IN GENERAL ASSIGN THE SAME COMMON ORIGIN TO MOST LAPIDE OUS SOLIDS WHICH THEY SUPPOSE TO BE GENERATED BY DEPOSI TION FROM AN AQUEOUS FLUID IN WHATEVER MANNER THERE FORE THE PRISMATIC BODIES IN QUESTION ARE CLASSED UPON SUCH A PRINCIPLE NO ADEQUATE IDEA CAN THENCE BE ASCERTAINED CONCERNING THEIR ORIGIN WHICH SEEMS MANIFESTLY DIFFERENT FOR SURELY THE STRUCTURE AND OTHER PHAENOMENA OF THESE BO DIES SUFFICIENTLY PROVE THEM TO BE CRYSTALLIZATIONS OR CON CRETIONS OF A PARTICULAR KIND AND GENERATED IMMEDIATELY FROM AN IGNEOUS FLUID FOR THEY ARE NOT ONLY PECULIAR TO VUL CANIC TRACTS OF COUNTRY BUT DIFFER IN EVERY RESPECT FROM COMMON CRYSTALS PRODUCED FROM AN AQUEOUS FLUID EVERY ONE KNOWS THAT THE LATTER ARE FORMED STRATUM SUPER STRA TUM BY A SLOW AND SUCCESSIVE DEPOSITION AND JUXTAPOSI TION OF PARTS AS HATH BEEN PROVED SATISFACTORILY BY CAP PELER LINNAEUS AND OTHER WRITERS ON THIS SUBJECT THE SAME MODE OF GENERATION IS MORE PARTICULARLY EXPLAINED BY STENO IN HIS EXCELLENT TREATISE DE SOLIDO INTRA SOLIDU NATURALITER CONTENTO BUT THIS MODE DOES NOT SEEM AT ALL RECONCILEABLE WITH THE BASALTINE CRYSTALLIZATIONS IN QUES TION FOR HOWEVER THESE BODIES MAY VARY IN THEIR TEX TURE NONE OF THEM NOTWITHSTANDING AFFORD THE LEAST IN DICATION OF AN ORIGIN COMMON TO OTHER CRYSTALS BUT SEEM RATHER THE EFFECTS OF SOME INTRINSIC PRINCIPLE OF ORGANIZA TION BY WHICH THEY APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN PRODUCED SIMUL VOL LXV D TANEOUSLY18 TANEOUSLY IN A MANNER UPON THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE WHOLE MASS OF MATTER IN WHICH THEY LIE AND WITH WHICH THEY CONSTANTLY BEAR THE GREATEST ANALOGY AS I HAVE BE FORE OBSERVED IT IS FURTHER REMARKABLE THAT COMMON CRYSTALS ARE PARASITICAL BODIES WHEREAS BASALTINE CRYS TALLIZATIONS NOTWITHSTANDING THE PECULIARITIES OF THEIR FI GURES RATHER SEEM TO FORM INTEGRAL PARTS OF THE MASSES TO WHICH THEY ADHERE AND SEEM TO ACKNOWLEDGE WITH THEM ONE COMMON AND SIMULTANEOUS ORIGIN LIKE THE RHOMBOIDAL AND OTHER CRYSTALLIZATIONS IN GRANITES AND OTHER SIMILAR VITRIFIABLE COMPOUND STONES NOR DOES THE COMMON SLOW AND LIMITED PRINCIPLE OF CRYSTALLIZATION SEEM AT ALL ADEQUATE TO SO GREAT AN EFFECT WHICH SEEMS EX CLUSIVELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN IGNEOUS FLUID ON THE GENERAL CONCRETION OF WHICH THE ORGANIC PRINCIPLE MAY BE SUP POSED TO HAVE OPERATED SIMULTANEOUSLY IN A LARGE MASS AND PRODUCED THESE BODIES IN THE SAME MANNER AS A LIN GET OF METAL CONCRETES AT ONCE IN THE MOULD NO OTHER MODE OF GENERATION SEEMS RECONCILEABLE WITH THE PHAE NOMENA OF BASALTINE AGGREGATES AS I SHALL MORE FULLY PROVE IN THE ACCOUNT OF THOSE OF AUVERGNE AND VELAY NOR DO I PRETEND TO DETERMINE HOW STRICTLY THIS SIMULTA NEOUS CONCRETION OF PARTS MAY BE APPLIED TO THE ORGANI ZATION OF SUCH BODIES HAVING USED THAT EXPRESSION RATHER IN OPPOSITION TO THE FLOW AND INTERRUPTED SUCCESSION THAT TO ALL APPEARANCE TAKES PLACE IN THE FORMATION OF COMMON CRYSTALS IT SEEMS ALSO FURTHER EVIDENT TO ME FROM THE PHAENOMENA THAT PRISMATIC BASALTINE CRYSTALLIZATIONS AND OTHER REGULARLY FIGURED VULCANIC GROUPS FOR OTHERS HAVE19 HAVE LATELY OCCURRED TO ME IN AUVERGNE AND VELAY WHICH HAVE NEVER YET BEEN CONSIDERED AND OF WHICH I SHALL HEREAFTER GIVE AN ACCOUNT IT SEEMS I SAY EVIDENT TO ME THAT SUCH REGULAR BODIES HAVE BEEN GENERATED LOCALLY AND NOT IN THE MIDST OF THOSE VIOLENT CONVULSIONS OF NATURE WHICH ARE COMMONLY ASSIGNED FOR THE ORIGIN OF VULCANIC MOUNTAINS IN GENERAL THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF ORGANIZA TION WHATEVER IT BE OPERATES LOCALLY IN THE FORMATION OF THESE BODIES APPEARS I THINK SUFFICIENTLY EVIDENT FROM THE REGULAR DISPOSITION AND OTHER PARTICULAR CHARACTERS OF THEIR GROUPS FOR NOTWITHSTANDING THE VARIOUS DIRECTIONS OF THE COLUMNS AND MASSES COMPOSED OF THEM IN THE DIF FERENT GROUPS AS I HAVE BEFORE OBSERVED YET IN OTHER RESPECTS THE GREATEST REGULARITY OF DISPOSITION IS COMMON LY OBSERVABLE THEY FORM STRATA WHICH ARE UNIFORMLY ORGANIZED DISPOSED IN PARTICULAR DIRECTIONS AND OFTEN CONSTANT IN THE SAME TO A GREAT EXTENT THESE STRATA NOT ONLY MANIFEST A PARALLELISM BETWEEN THEIR REGULARLY FI GURED PARTS BUT IN THEIR WHOLE AGGREGATES WHICH OFTEN FORM EXTENSIVE HORIZONTAL BEDS AND OF AN EQUAL THICK NESS THROUGHOUT THIS PARALLELISM IS ALSO EQUALLY RE MARKABLE IN GROUPS THAT ARE COMPOSED OF MANY STRATA AS I HAVE PARTICULARLY OBSERVED IN THOSE OF MURAT AND THE CASTLE HILL OF ACHON IN UPPER AUVERGNE IN WHICH THE COLUMNAR STRATA ARE NOT ONLY PARALLEL IN THEMSELVES BUT PRESERVE IN THEIR POSITION A PARALLELISM WITH THE OTHER STRATA OF THE RESPECTIVE GROUPS WHICH LIE IN REGULAR STAGES ONE ABOVE THE OTHER AND SINCE THESE GROUPS COMMONLY FORM IN A MANNER INTEGRAL PARTS OF THE MASSES OR MOUN D 2 TAINS20 TAINS IN WHICH THEY ARE FOUND AND THESE MANIFEST ALSO SOME AFFINITY IN THEIR STRUCTURE IT SEEMS MOST REASONABLE TO ASSIGN TO BOTH ONE COMMON ORIGIN THE RECEIVED NOTIONS CONCERNING THE MODE OF ORIGIN OF VULCANIC HILLS DO NOT THEREFORE SEEM INTIRELY TO CORRESPOND WITH THE PHAENOMENA OF NATURE SINCE NATURALISTS GENERALLY SUP POSE THAT THEY HAVE ALL BEEN THROWN UP FROM THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH BY SUBTERRANEOUS EXPLOSIONS LIKE THE MONTE DI CENERE NEAR PUZZUOLI IN THE KINGDOM OF NAPLES THE ISLAND OF SANTORINO IN THE ARCHIPELAGO OR THE EJECTED EN TRAILS OF VESUVIUS AND AETNA BUT SURELY THIS MUST APPEAR A MISTAKEN NOTION TO ANY ONE WHO COMPARES THESE TUMUL TUARY AND INORDINATE AGGREGATES WITH THE REGULAR VULCANIC ORGANIZATIONS BEFORE DESCRIBED FOR IN FACT WHAT DOES VESUVIUS AETNA THE MONTE DI CENERE AND SUCH LIKE ERUCTED PILES PRESENT TO US BUT A HEAP OF RUINS WHICH EVIDENTLY MANIFEST THE CASUAL AND EXTRAORDINARY CAUSE TO WHICH THEY AVOWEDLY OWE THEIR ORIGIN BUT THIS ORIGIN SEEMS IRRECONCILEABLE WITH THE REGULAR STRUCTURES BEFORE MENTIONED AS MAY PERHAPS SATISFACTORILY APPEAR FROM MY CONSIDERATIONS ON THE PARTICULAR PHAENOMENA THAT CHARACTERIZE THEM AND THOUGH IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT SUCH ORGANIZATIONS MAY SOMETIMES TAKE PLACE UPON THE CONCRETION OF LIQUIFIED MATTER THROWN UP IN VULCANIC ERUPTIONS YET HOWEVER SIMILAR THEY MAY BE FROM THE NATURE OF THEIR ORIGIN I CAN HARDLY IMAGINE THEY CAN FORM OTHER THAN IMPERFECT AND IRREGULAR MASSES FOR HOWEVER WONDERFUL THE RIVERS OF LAVA OF VESUVIUS OR AET NA MAY APPEAR TO US THEY IN REALITY ARE BUT PARTIAL AND 4 TUMULTUARY21 TUMULTUARY EFFORTS OF NATURE THAT BY NO MEANS SEEM ADE QUATE TO THE PRODUCTION OF A GIANTS CAUSEWAY OR THE BA SALTINE ORGANIZATIONS OF AUVERGNE AND VELAY SEVERAL OF WHICH CONTINUE ALMOST UNINTERRUPTEDLY FOR MANY MILES THIS I HAVE MORE PARTICULARLY OBSERVED IN THE SOLITARY AND HORIZONTAL BASALTINE STRATA THAT CAP THE HIGH THOUGH FLAT VULCANIC HILLS IN AUVERGNE AND THE ADJACENT PART OF VELAY AS MAY BE MORE PARTICULARLY SEEN AT THE BROWS OF THOSE HILLS IN THE RESPECTIVE VALLIES THE CELEBRATED MDE BUFFON SPEAKING OF THESE HILLS STYLES THEM DES PLAINES EN MONTAGNES QUI FORMENT DES PAYS AU DESSUS DES AUTRES PAISF THEY ALSO PROVE THE MISTAKE OF SOME NATURALISTS WHO FALSELY ASCRIBING TO VULCANIC HILLS IN GENERAL THE SAME ORIGIN AS TO VESUVIUS AND AETNA EXCLUSIVELY ASSIGN TO THEM ALSO THE SAME CONICAL OR ORBICULAR FORMS BUT IF I MISTAKE NOT THE PARTICULAR AND RELATIVE CHARACTERS OF BA SALTINE AND OTHER REGULAR VULCANIC ORGANIZATIONS OF THE LIKE KIND CONTRADICT A CASUAL AND TUMULTUARY CAUSE AND EVINCE THE NECESSITY OF THEIR LOCAL ORIGIN UPON A MORE STEADY AND UNIFORM PRINCIPLE I SHALL ALSO FURTHER OB SERVE THAT I NEVER SAW ANY CERTAIN VESTIGE OF A REGULAR CRATER IN ANY SPOT CHARACTERIZED BY SIMILAR ORGANIZATIONS WHICH AS I BEFORE REMARKED FORM IN GENERAL INTEGRAL PARTS OF THE MASSES TO WHICH THEY ADHERE AND WHICH ALSO FREQUENTLY MANIFEST AN ANALOGOUS STRUCTURE HOWEVER IR REGULAR AND SO FAR ARE THEY FROM REPRESENTING THE RUIN OUS SCENES OF VESUVIUS OR AETNA THAT THEY OFTEN AFFORD NO LOOSE OR ISOLATED MASSES EXCEPT FRAGMENTS OF THE COLUMNS F HISTOIRE NATURELLE TOM II P 11 OF22 OF SUCH GROUPS WHICH HAVE GIVEN WAY THROUGH TIME THIS I HAVE MORE PARTICULARLY OBSERVED IN THE VULCANIC AND COLUMNAR HILLS OF ISENCHAUX IN VELAY IN WHICH THE GROUPS OF COLUMNS ARE OFTEN SO UNITED WITH THE BODY OF LAVA THAT THEY FORM IN A MANNER BUT ONE SOLID THOUGH FIGURED MASS MONTE ROSSO IS PRECISELY OF THIS CHARACTER NOR DID I OBSERVE A SINGLE COLUMN OR FRAGMENT EVEN LOOSE THOSE IN THE DRAWING BEING MERELY INTRODUCED TO SHOW THE FORMS OF THE COLUMNS NEITHER ARE THERE HERE OR IN THE BASALTINE HILLS NEAR ISENCHAUX ANY SIGNS OF A CRATER ON THE CONTRARY THESE HILLS AS WELL AS MONTE ROSSO ARE MOSTLY TERMINATED BY REGULAR CONVEX SUMMITS THAT FORM A SOLID MASS AND THAT FUSED MASSES SHOULD FREQUENTLY CONCRETE IN SUCH A FORM WE NEED NOT WONDER IF WE REFLECT ON THE EFFERVESCENT AND EXPANSIVE PROPERTY OF FIRE THE PHAENOMENON OF HORIZONTAL VULCANIC HILLS IS ACCOUNTABLE UPON ANOTHER PRINCIPLE AND SEEMS CHIEFLY TO DEPEND ON THE STATE OF THOSE HILLS BEFORE THEIR IGNITION AS I SHALL ENDEAVOUR TO PROVE IN MY ACCOUNT OF THOSE OF AUVERGNE AND OF WHICH THE VULCANIC HILLS OF THE VERO NESE AND VICENTINE DISTRICTS AFFORD ALSO SINGULAR INSTANCES WHICH I SHALL NOW CONSIDER IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY IN WHAT STATE VULCANIC HILLS OF A PARTICULAR AND REGULAR STRUC TURE LIKE THE BASALTINE HILLS FOR INSTANCE MAY HAVE PRE EXISTED BEFORE THEIR ALTERATIONS BY FIRE SINCE THEY AFFORD EVIDENT PROOFS NOT ONLY OF A LIQUEFACTION BUT OF AN IN TIRE NEW ORGANIZATION BY WHICH MEANS ALL MARKS OF THEIR FORMER CHARACTERS ARE TOTALLY EFFACED NOTWITHSTANDING WHICH SINCE THESE ORGANIZATIONS ARE GENERATED LOCALLY SOME23 SOME LIGHT IS OFTEN TO BE HAD EVEN IN THIS DIFFICULT QUESTION AND MERELY FROM THE PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY OF THE COUNTRY INDEPENDENT OF THE PARTICULAR STRUCTURE OF THE HILLS THEM SELVES FOR COUNTRIES HAVE THEIR EXTERNAL CHARACTERS AC CORDING TO THE NATURE OF THE HILLS THAT COMPOSE THEM THOUGH THESE CHARACTERS SELDOM FORM A PART OF THE GEO GRAPHERS INQUIRIES GEOGRAPHY HAVING NEVER YET BEEN FORMALLY CONSIDERED BUT AS SUBSERVIENT TO CIVIL HISTORY I SHALL NOT ENTER PARTICULARLY INTO THIS QUESTION AT PRESENT ONLY SHALL OBSERVE THAT THE DIFFERENCE IN THE EXTERNAL CHARACTERS OF MOUNTAINS ACCORDING TO THEIR INTERNAL STRUC TURE IS EASILY SEEN ON COMPARING FOR INSTANCE THE OUT WARD FORMS OF MOUNTAINS OF GRANITE OR OTHER SIMILAR VI TRIFIABLE COMPOUND STONES WHICH ARE OF AN IRREGULAR STRUCTURE WITH THOSE OF LIMESTONE WHICH ARE COMMONLY FORMED IN REGULAR STRATA SIGNAL EXAMPLES OF THIS ARE OBSERVABLE IN THE CHAIN OF MOUNT JURA WHICH IS EXCLU SIVELY CALCAREOUS AND OF A HORIZONTAL SUMMIT AND THAT OF THE ALPS WHOSE HIGHEST MOUNTAINS ARE MOSTLY OF GRANITE AND TERMINATE IN PICS PYRAMIDS AND OTHER IRREGULARLY POINTED FORMS ACCORDING TO THE NATURE OF SUCH MOUN TAINS WHEN THEREFORE A REMARKABLE SIMILITUDE IS OB SERVABLE BETWEEN THE FORMS AND DISPOSITION OF THE HILLS AND VALLIES OF A VULCANIC DISTRICT AND THOSE OF OTHER COUN TRIES OF A CERTAIN CHARACTER THAT HAVE NOT SUFFERED BY FIRE IT IS REASONABLE ENOUGH UPON THE PRINCIPLES BEFORE ADOPT ED TO SUPPOSE THE SAME SIMILITUDE EVEN IN THE PRIMARY STRUCTURE AND QUALITIES OF THE FORMER HOWEVER THEY MAY HAVE BEEN OBLITERATED BY THE INTERVENTION OF FIRE THE VULCANIC24 VULCANIC DISTRICTS OF AUVERGNE AND VELAY AS WELL AS THOSE OF THE VENETIAN STATE AFFORD PROOFS ENOUGH OF THE TRUTH OF THIS OPINION BUT I SHALL CONFINE MYSELF AT PRESENT TO THE LATTER AND PARTICULARLY TO THE PHAENOMENA OF THIS KIND WHICH I OBSERVED IN THE VICENTINE AND VERONESE MOUNTAINS AND WHICH IF I MISTAKE NOT WILL APPEAR DE CISIVE IN THE QUESTION BEFORE US THESE MOUNTAINS OCCUPY THE LOWER SKIRTS OF THE ALPSON THE NORTH SIDE OF LOMBARDY AND ARE PARTLY VULCANIC AND PARTLY OF LIMESTONE THEY FORM SUBDIVISIONS OR LATERAL BRANCHES OF THE GREAT CHAIN OF THE ALPS FROM WHICH THEY DIVERGE NEARLY AT RIGHT ANGLES AND EXTEND IN A SOUTHERN DIRECTION AND PARALLEL WITH EACH OTHER TOWARDS THE PLAIN SOME OF THESE BRANCHES ARE INTIRELY OF LIMESTONE WITHOUT ANY LAVA OTHERS ARE COMPOSED OF A MIXTURE OF BOTH AND OTHERS AGAIN ARE EXCLUSIVELY VULCANIC I HAVE RODE FROM THE POINT OF ONE OF THEM NEAR MONTEBELLO IN THE VERONESE TERRITORY TO BOLCA ALWAYS UPON LAVA FOR THE DISTANCE OF NEAR TWENTY MILES IT IS ALONG THIS BRANCH BY THE SIDE OF THE VALLEY LEADING TO BOLCA AND ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE MILES SHORT OF IT THAT THE CAUSEWAY OF SAN GIOVANNI ILLARIONE BEFORE DESCRIBED IS SITUATED THE WHOLE SOLID MASS OF THIS BRANCH AS FAR AS I COULD OBSERVE IS ALMOST INTIRELY COMPOSED OF LAVA WHICH ABOUT THE SKIRTS AND SURFACE PARTICULARLY IS OF VARIOUS KINDS AMONG OTHERS VERY CU RIOUS I REMARKED SOME AT THE FOOT OF THE CASTLE HILL NEAR MONTEBELLO CONCRETED IN DIFFERENT MASSES WHICH BY THEIR EXTREME HARDNESS HETEROGENEOUS TEXTURE AND COLOUR VERY MUCH RESEMBLE AN ORDINARY SORT OF PORPHYRY BUT I SAW NO25 NO GRANITE MIXED WITH THE LAVA IN THESE LOWER LIMESTONE SKIRTS OF THE ALPS THOUGH IT ABOUNDS SO MUCH IN THE NEIGHBOURING EUGANEAN HILLS AS WELL AS IN AUVERGNE AND VELAY AS I BEFORE OBSERVED NOTWITHSTANDING THE GENERAL VULCANIC CHARACTER OF THIS BRANCH OF MONTEBELLO ITS ORIGINAL STRUCTURE AND CHARACTERS ARE STILL VERY EVIDENT AND PERFECTLY CORRESPOND WITH THOSE OF THE NEIGHBOURING BRANCHES THAT HAVE NEVER SUFFERED FIRE FOR THOUGH SOME NEW IGNEOUS MODIFICATIONS HAVE ACCIDENTALLY AND PARTIAL LY TAKEN PLACE ABOUT THE SKIRTS AND SURFACE OF THIS BRANCH YET IN OTHER MORE INTERNAL PARTS NOT ONLY THE ORIGINAL HORIZONTAL POSITION AND PARALLELISM OF THE STRATA ARE MA NIFEST BUT SMALL THOUGH INTEGRAL PARTS OF THOSE STRATA HERE AND THERE REMAIN UNBURNT AND SHOW THEIR CALCA REOUS QUALITIES STRUCTURE AND EXTRANEOUS CONTENTS PER FECTLY SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE OTHER NEIGHBOURING MOUN TAINS THAT HAVE NEVER SUFFERED BY FIRE THIS I PARTICU LARLY OBSERVED ALONG THE BROWS OR UPPER LATERAL STRATA OF THE VULCANIC BRANCH JUST MENTIONED ABOVE THE VALLEY BE TWEEN SORIO AND MONTEBELLO THE FAMOUS FOSSIL FISH QUAR RY AT BOLCA SO WELL KNOWN TO ALL THE CURIOUS IN EUROPE IS ONLY AN UNBURNT CALCAREOUS AND SLATY POINT OR SIDE PROMONTORY AS IT WERE OF THE HIGHEST PART OF THE SAME VULCANIC BRANCH THAT DESCENDS INTO THE VALLEY FROM THE CHURCH AND VILLAGE OF BOLCA WHICH ARE BUILT UPON IT THIS POINT WITHIN UNITES IMMEDIATELY WITH THE LAVA FORMING IN A MANNER AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE SAME HILL IN OTHER PARTS AGAIN AND PARTICULARLY AT RONCA ALSO IN THE VERONESE TERRITORY A FEW MILES TO THE NORTHWEST OF VOL LXV E MONTEBELLO26 MONTEBELLO THOUGH THE MASS IS CONVERTED INTIRELY TO LAVA AND HAS EVIDENTLY CONCRETED FROM A FUSION YET THE MA RINE FOSSIL BODIES ORIGINALLY CONTAINED IN THE STRATA ARE DISTINGUISHABLE AND EVEN DISTINCT IN THE LAVA THOUGH VA RIOUSLY DISFIGURED ANOTHER OBSERVATION I MADE AND WHICH APPEARS TO ME VERY INTERESTING IS THAT MOST OF THESE BRANCHES IN THE VERONESE AND VICENTINE TERRITORIES WHETHER MARINE VULCANIC OR MIXED STILL PRESERVE NEARLY THE SAME EXTERNAL CHARACTERS DIRECTIONS AND PARALLELISM EXCLUSIVE OF THE TRIFLING ALTERATIONS PRODUCED AT THE SURFACE OF THE LATTER AS I BEFORE OBSERVED IT SEEMS THEREFORE SUFFICIENTLY EVIDENT THAT FIRE NOT ONLY OPERATES LOCALLY ON LAPIDEOUS SOLIDS BUT OFTEN ALSO IN SUCH A MANNER AS NOT IN TIRELY TO DESTROY ALL MARKS OF THEIR PRIMARY ORGANIZATION AND QUALITIES MUCH LESS TO ALTER THEIR DISPOSITIONS AND THE EXTERNAL CHARACTERS OF THE MASSES OR MOUNTAINS THEY FORM AND THOUGH ALL TRACES OF THE PRIMARY ORGANIZA TION OF THESE MASSES MAY BE EFFACED BY NEW MODIFICATIONS YET OFTEN SUFFICIENT PROOFS REMAIN OF THEIR FORMER CHARAC TERS IN THE FORMS DIRECTION AND DISPOSITION OF THE MOUN TAINS THEY COMPOSE AS APPEARS FROM THE INSTANCE I HAVE JUST CONSIDERED AND IS STILL MORE STRONGLY CONFIRMED BY THE PHAENOMENA OF AUVERGNE AND VELAY WHICH I SHALL CONSIDER UPON A FUTURE OCCASION IT DOES NOT THERE FORE SEEM IMPOSSIBLE NOR EVEN DIFFICULT TO TRACE THE LEAD ING ORIGINAL CHARACTER OF A COUNTRY THOUGH IT HAS SUF FERED BY FIRE A NEW MODIFICATION OF THE STRATA THAT COM POSE IT AND THE VULCANIC MOUNTAINS BEFORE DESCRIBED NOT ONLY AFFORD EVIDENT MARKS OF THEIR HAVING PREEXISTED IN27 IN ANOTHER STATE BUT MANIFEST ALSO PLAINLY THEIR PRIMARY QUALITIES AND STRUCTURE AND EQUALLY PROVE BY THEIR PAR TICULAR DIRECTIONS THAT THEY NEVER CAN HAVE BEEN THROWN UP FORTUITOUSLY FROM THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH LIKE THE MONTE DI CENERE C BUT HAVE SUFFERED FIRE IN STATU QUO OR LOCALLY WITHOUT THE LEAST APPEARANCE OF SUBVERSION OR CHANGE OF PLACE THE SAME SEEMS ALSO VERY PROBABLE OF MANY OTHER MOUNTAINS THAT ARE PURELY VULCANIC FROM THE NECESSITY OF THE LOCAL ORIGIN OF THEIR PARTICULAR ORGA NIZATIONS WHICH I HAVE BEFORE CONSIDERED AND SUPPOSING EVEN THAT SUCH MOUNTAINS MANIFEST NO INTERNAL NOR EX TERNAL SIGNS OF THEIR PRIMITIVE STRUCTURES OR QUALITIES FROM THE PRECEDING OBSERVATIONS IT APPEARS I THINK EVI DENT THAT SUBTERRANEOUS EXPLOSIONS AND ERUPTIONS ARE MERELY ACCIDENTAL PHAENOMENA THAT ARE BY NO MEANS ES SENTIAL TO THE PRODUCTION OF ALL VULCANIC MOUNTAINS AS HAS BEEN COMMONLY IMAGINED THIS NOTION SEEMS TO HAVE PROCEEDED FROM THE AFFINITY OFTEN OBSERVABLE IN THE QUALITIES AND EXTERNAL FORMS OF MANY SUCH MOUNTAINS AND THOSE OF REAL VOLCANOS BUT I HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED THAT THERE ARE MANY VULCANIC MOUNTAINS OF A TOTALLY DIF FERENT FORM FROM THE COMMON VOLCANOS AND THOUGH THEIR LAVA MAY SOMETIMES BE SIMILAR IN ITS QUALITIES YET THE REGULAR ORGANIZATION OF IT IN THE FORMER FREQUENTLY MAKES A MOST ESSENTIAL DIFFERENCE FOR AS I BEFORE SAID WHAT DOES VESUVIUS OR AETNA PRESENT TO US BUT A HEAP OF RUINS WHICH GIVE US NOT THE LEAST IDEA OF THE STRUCTURES TO WHICH THEY BELONGED AND THOUGH THEY MAY LEAD AND ENLIGHTEN THE CHYMIST YET THEY AFFORD BUT LITTLE INSTRUC E 2 TION28 TION TO THE PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHER A CONSTANT SAMENESS OF PHAENOMENA OCCURRING EVERY WHERE NOR HAVE WE ANY FOUNDATION FROM THE EXTERNAL APPEARANCE OF SUCH MOUN TAINS TO CONCLUDE THAT ALL OTHERS THAT HAVE SUFFERED FIRE ARE OF THE SAME CHARACTER WE SEE NOTHING BUT A HEAP OF RUINS CAST UP FROM THEIR BOWELS AND WE ARE APT TO IMAGINE THAT SUCH INORDINATE MATERIALS COMPOSE THE IN TIRE MASS AND ANALOGY TOO OFTEN SEDUCIVE IN SIMILAR MAT TERS LEADS US TO CONCLUDE THE SAME OF OTHER VULCANIC MOUNTAINS IN GENERAL BUT I AM MUCH INCLINED TO THINK THAT THE MATERIALS THROWN UP BY BURNING MOUNTAINS ARE ONLY LODGED SUPERFICIALLY AS IT WERE ON THEIR SIDES AND THOUGH THEY MAY CONSIDERABLY INCREASE THEIR BULK AS WELL AS ALTER THEIR FORM YET THEY DO NOT SEEM TO CON STITUTE THE INTIRE MASS OF THOSE MOUNTAINS AS MIGHT BE REASONABLY IMAGINED FROM THEIR EXTERNAL APPEARANCE FOR IT HAS BEEN OBSERVED BOTH BY PADRE DE LA TORRE M DE LA LANDE G AND OTHERS THAT THE INNER SIDES EVEN OF THE FUNNEL OF MOUNT VESUVIUS PRESERVE MANIFEST VES TIGES OF ITS PRIMARY ORGANIZATION IN REGULAR PARALLEL AND NEARLY HORIZONTAL STRATA LIKE THOSE OF OTHER COMMON MOUNTAINS AND DOES IT NOT APPEAR MORE THAN PROBABLE FROM HENCE THAT AN ORIGINAL MOUNTAIN LIES UNDER THE LAVA OF VESUVIUS SERVING IN A MANNER AS ITS BASE AND WHICH WHATEVER LOCAL ALTERATION IT MAY HAVE RECEIVED IN TRINSICALLY FROM THE SUBTLE ELEMENT THAT WASTES ITS BOW ELS STILL MAINTAINS ITS PRIMARY UNDISTURBED STRUCTURE LIKE THE VULCANIC MOUNTAINS OF THE VERONESE TERRITORY BE G VOYAGES DITALIE TOM VII P 169 176 FORE29 FORE DESCRIBED IT IS NOT THEREFORE LIKELY THAT THE WHOLE OF MOUNT VESUVIUS SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE AT SEVERAL TIMES BY THE EARTH AND CINDERS FLUNG UP OUT OF THE MOUTH THAT LIES IN THE MIDST OF THEM THE ASHES FALLING DOWN THE SIDES OF IT LIKE THE SAND IN AN HOURGLASS AS MR ADDISON H PARTICULARLY OBSERVES AND AS MOST PEO PLE ARE NATURALLY ENOUGH APT TO THINK AND HOWEVER CONSIDERABLY THE BULK OF THIS MOUNTAIN MAY HAVE BEEN INCREASED BY THE LOADS OF LAVA THROWN OUT AT THE SEVERAL ERUPTIONS YET NO GREAT ADDITION SEEMS TO HAVE ACCEDED TO ITS HEIGHT IF THE OBSERVATION JUST MENTIONED BE TRUE WHICH THOUGH I HAVE NEVER HAD IT IN MY POWER TO VERIFY YET I READILY BELIEVE NOT ONLY ON ACCOUNT OF THE RESPECTA BLE AUTHORITIES ABOVE QUOTED BUT ALSO FROM ITS CONSISTENCY WITH OTHER SIMILAR AND INDISPUTABLE PHAENOMENA OF WHICH THE VULCANIC BRANCH OF MONTEBELLO BEFORE DESCRIBED AF FORDS IF I MISTAKE NOT NO INCONSIDERABLE PROOF NOR DOES IT INDEED APPEAR AGREEABLE TO REASON THAT MOUNTAINS OF GREAT HEIGHT WHERE VOLCANOS EXIST SHOULD BE ENTIRELY VO MITED UP IN THIS MANNER SUCH VOLCANOS SEEMING TO RE QUIRE A SOLID AND PERMANENT CHANNEL FOR THE VIOLENCE AND FREQUENCY OF THE EFFECTS THEY PRODUCE IT SEEMS THERE FORE THAT A WAY OR CHANNEL ONLY HAS BEEN OPENED BY AN ORIGINAL EFFORT OR EXPLOSION THROUGH MOUNT VESUVIUS WHICH HAS SINCE BEEN DEEPLY BURIED BY THE MATERIALS SUC CESSIVELY THROWN UP FROM ITS BOWELS IN THE SEVERAL ERUP TIONS AND I AM INCLINED TO THINK THE SAME OF MOUNT AETNA FROM ITS SUPERIOR HEIGHT THOUGH I AM UNCERTAIN H TRAVELS P 184 WHETHER30 WHETHER BORELLI OR ANY OTHER OF ITS HISTORIOGRAPHERS TAKES NOTICE OF ANY FACT BY WHICH THIS CONJECTURE IS PROVED THE SAME SEEMS ALSO PROBABLE FOR SIMILAR REA SONS OF MOUNT HECLA THE PIC OF TENERIF C AND IF THIS BE TRUE OF SINGLE OR ISOLATED VOLCANOS LIKE VESUVIUS AND AETNA THAT CARRY SUCH STRONG EXTERNAL MARKS OF HAV ING BEEN EXCLUSIVELY PRODUCED BY THE ACCUMULATED LAVA OF ERUPTIONS MUCH MORE IS IT LIKELY TO BE SO OF OTHERS THAT ARE NOT ONLY CONSIDERABLY HIGHER BUT FORM PARTS OF A CONTINUED CHAIN LIKE THE VOLCANOS OF THE ANDES AS I IMAGINE IS IT NOT MOREOVER HIGHLY IMPROBABLE THAT CHIMBOROSO WHICH IS ONE OF THOSE VOLCANOS AND THE HIGHEST MOUNTAINS IN THE KNOWN GLOBE MEASURING AC CORDING TO THE FRENCH ACADEMICIANS 3220 TOISES WHICH EXCEED FOUR ITALIAN MILES ALLOWING 764 TOISES TO A MILE IS IT NOT I SAY HIGHLY IMPROBABLE THAT SUCH A MOUNTAIN SHOULD EXCLUSIVELY OWE ITS ORIGIN AND FORMATION TO THE ACCUMULATED MATERIALS OF ERUPTIONS ONLY MAY NOT THE SAME BE SAID OF THE MOUNTAINS ANTISANA KOTOPACSI PI CHINCHA AND THE OTHER VOLCANOS OF THE ANDES OF WHICH SOME ARE LITTLE INFERIOR IN HEIGHT TO CHIMBOROSO AND CONSTITUTE IN GENERAL THE HIGHEST PARTS OF THAT VAST CHAIN AND THOUGH THE SUMMITS OF THESE MOUNTAINS IN ALL PRO BABILITY FORM ISOLATED POINTS YET I PRESUME THEY UNITE IN AN UNINTERRUPTED MASS BELOW LIKE OTHER CHAINS OF MOUNTAINS AND IF THIS BE TRUE IT IS HARDLY CREDIBLE THAT THE MASSES WHERE THESE VOLCANOS RESPECTIVELY EXIST CAN HAVE BEEN INDEBTED SOLELY TO THEM FOR THEIR ORIGIN OR THAT THEY CAN HAVE BEEN FORTUITOUSLY CAST UP FROM THE 7 BOWELS31 BOWELS OF THE EARTH LIKE THE MONTE DI CENERE THE ISLAND OF SANTORINO C IF THEY FORM INTEGRAL PARTS OF A CON TINUED CHAIN AS IT IS NATURAL TO SUPPOSE IS IT NOT EVEN ABSURD TO IMAGINE THAT THEY CAN HAVE HAD SUCH AN ORI GIN IS IT NOT ON THE CONTRARY RATHER TO BE PRESUMED THAT CHANNELS ONLY HAVE BEEN OPENED ALONG THIS CHAIN BY DIFFERENT EXPLOSIONS WHERE THESE VOLCANOS RESPECTIVELY EXIST AND THAT THE SIDES OF THESE CHANNELS FORM INTEGRAL PARTS OF ITS ORIGINAL STRUCTURE AS IN THE CASE OF MOUNT VE SUVIUS BEFORE REMARKED AND WHICH HERE SEEMS TO RECEIVE THE STRONGEST CONFIRMATION FOR HOWEVER THE ERUPTIONS OF THE VOLCANOS OF THE ANDES MAY HAVE LOADED THEIR SIDES AND SUMMITS IN PARTICULAR PARTS YET SURELY INFERIOR MASSES EXIST OF A MUCH PRIOR ORIGIN AND WHOSE CONTINUITY SUFFI CIENTLY SEEMS TO PROVE THAT SUCH ERUPTIONS ARE RELATIVELY ONLY ACCIDENTAL PHAENOMENA THIS REASONING IS HOW EVER GROUNDED UPON THE SUPPOSITION THAT THE ANDES FORM A CONTINUED CHAIN LIKE THAT OF OTHER SIMILAR MOUN TAINS AND AS I PRESUME THEY DO FROM THE PRECEDING OBSERVATIONS IT SEEMS THEREFORE EVIDENT THAT WHETHER VUL CANIC MOUNTAINS PRESERVE OR NOT VESTIGES OF THEIR ANCIENT AND PRIMITIVE STATE OR IN WHATSOEVER MANNER THEY AP PEAR TO HAVE BEEN NEWLY ORGANIZED FEW OF THEM SEEM TO HAVE BEEN INTIRELY THROWN UP FROM THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH LIKE THE MONTE DI CENERE C ON THE CONTRARY THEY MOSTLY APPEAR TO HAVE PREEXISTED IN ANOTHER STATE AND TO HAVE SUFFERED BY FIRE ONLY LOCALLY AND MORE OR LESS PARTIALLY OF WHICH I HAVE GIVEN SUFFICIENT PROOFS OR HAVING AFFORDED ONLY PASSAGES TO EXPLOSIONS AND ERUPTIONS ARE32 ARE PARTLY IN AN ORIGINAL STATE WITHIN AND PARTLY INCREASED BY NEW AND ADVENTITIOUS MATERIALS SUPERADDED TO THEIR SURFACE BY SUCCESSIVE ERUPTIONS AS SEEMS TO BE THE CASE OF THE VULCANIC MOUNTAINS OF THE ANDES MOUNT VESUVIUS AND PROBABLY OF MOST OTHER VOLCANOS OF ANY GREAT HEIGHT MORE ESPECIALLY WHERE THEY FORM PARTS OF CONTINUED CHAINS AND IF SO FEW OF THE EXTINCT VULCANIC MOUNTAINS APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN THROWN UP FROM BELOW THE COM MON SURFACE OF THE EARTH LIKE THE MONTE DI CENERE C NOR EVEN THOSE INTIRELY WHICH MANIFEST ACTUAL VOLCANOS IT SEEMS HIGHLY IMPROBABLE THAT OTHER COMMON MOUNTAINS SHOULD HAVE HAD SUCH AN ORIGIN AS MANY RESPECTABLE WRI TERS I HAVE BEEN INCLINED TO THINK AND STILL MORE SO THAT SUCH SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE SOLE ORIGIN OF ALL MOUNTAINS AS A LATE ITALIAN WRITER K ON THE THEORY OF THE EARTH HAS VERY UNSUCCESSFULLY ENDEAVOURED TO PROVE IT ALSO PLAINLY AP PEARS IF I MISTAKE NOT FROM WHAT HAS BEEN BEFORE SAID THAT THE PHAENOMENA OF RECENT VOLCANOS ARE VERY LITTLE CAL CULATED TO GIVE US MUCH INSTRUCTION ABOUT THE MORE CU RIOUS IGNEOUS CONCRETIONS AND THE ORIGIN OF VULCANIC MOUNTAINS IN GENERAL AND THAT A FEW DAYS TOUR IN SUCH COUNTRIES AS AUVERGNE VELAY AND THE VENETIAN STATE ARE WORTH A SEVEN YEARS APPRENTICESHIP AT THE FOOT OF MOUNT VESUVIUS OR AETNA WHERE NOTHING BUT A HEAP OF UN INSTRUCTIVE RUINS AND A SAMENESS OF PHAENOMENA APPEAR AND SINCE OUR IDEAS CONCERNING VULCANIC EFFECTS

PHAENO MENA OF AUVERGNE VELAY AND THE VERONESE AND VICEN TINE TERRITORIES I SHALL BEG LEAVE TO ADD A FEW OBSERVA TIONS OF THE LIKE NATURE RELATING TO THE EUGANEAN HILLS MORE ESPECIALLY AS THEY PRODUCE OTHER VULCANIC CONCRE TIONS EQUALLY CURIOUS AND OF A VERY DIFFERENT CHARACTER FROM ANY OBSERVED IN THE PROVINCES BEFORE MENTIONED THE EUGANEAN HILLS FORM AN IRREGULAR GROUP IN THE PLAIN OF LOMBARDY ABOUT SEVEN MILES NEARLY SOUTH BY WEST FROM PADUA AND EXTEND FROM NORTH TO SOUTH AS FAR AS ESTE THE MOST CONSIDERABLE PART OF THEM COMPOSES AN IRREGULAR SORT OF CHAIN WHICH EXTENDS IN THE ABOVE DI RECTION WHILE OTHER PARTS ARE SEVERALLY DETACHED AND FORM ISOLATED MOUNTAINS ABOUT THE SKIRTS OF THIS CHAIN PARTICULARLY ON THE NORTHEAST SIDE TOWARDS ABANO THE OUTER SKIRT OF THE INTIRE GROUP MAY MEASURE PERHAPS FROM THIRTY TO FORTY ENGLISH MILES THE EXTERNAL CHARACTERS OF THIS GROUP EXACTLY CORRESPOND WITH THE FORMS COM MONLY ASCRIBED BY NATURALISTS TO VULCANIC MOUNTAINS IN GENERAL SINCE THE POINTS OF THE CHAIN BEFORE MENTIONED AS WELL AS THE ISOLATED MEMBERS OF IT ARE OF VARIOUS CONI CAL ORBICULAR AND ELLIPTICAL SHAPES AS THIS GROUP THERE FORE RESTS UPON A PERFECT PLAIN IT MAKES A VERY SINGULAR APPEARANCE AND EXACTLY ANSWERS TO THE FOLLOWING LINES OF OVID L WHICH I HOPE I MAY THEREFORE BE PERMITTED TO INSERT THOUGH IN A PHILOSOPHICAL PAPER L MET LIB XV VOL LXV F EXTENTAM34 EXTENTAM

ROUND ISENCHAUX IN VE LAY AFFECT ALSO THE SAME FORMS BUT AS THEY ARE MIXED WITH OTHER HILLS OF A DIFFERENT FORM AND THE COUNTRY ABOUT THEM IS BROKEN AND IRREGULAR THEY DO NOT PRODUCE SO SINGULAR AN EFFECT AS THE EUGANEAN HILLS WHICH SUD DENLY RISE FROM A PERFECT LEVEL I AM INFORMED THAT THERE IS A SIMILAR THOUGH SMALLER GROUP OF ISOLATED VULCANIC HILLS IN A PLAIN OF DALMATIA NEAR COSSOVO AND ANOTHER GROUP OF HILLS NEARLY OF THE SAME FORMS IN THE COUNTY OF DOWN IN IRELAND AND CALLED THE MOURN HILLS WHICH LIKE THOSE NEAR PADUA CONSIST AS I AM INFORMED MOSTLY OF GRANITE AND LAVA THE EUGANEAN HILLS HAVE MORE OVER A SUPERFICIAL AND PARTIAL COVERING OF SLATY AND CAL CAREOUS STRATA OF POSTERIOR ORIGIN AND THAT MANIFEST NO MARKS OF HAVING SUFFERED BY FIRE SUCH STRATA SLIGHTLY CAP MOUNT VENDA WHICH IS THE HIGHEST AMONG THESE HILLS THOUGH OF NO VERY CONSIDERABLE ELEVATION MEASURING ONLY ABOUT 252 FRENCH TOISES ABOVE THE VENETIAN LA GUNES ACCORDING TO ABBE TOALDO PROFESSOR OF ASTRONOMY AT PADUA WHO LATELY AT MY REQUEST OBLIGINGLY TOOK ITS ELEVATION FROM THE OBSERVATORY AT PADUA FROM THE LAVA AND GRANITE MIXED TOGETHER IN THE EUGANEAN HILLS THEY BEAR AN AFFINITY WITH THOSE OF AUVERGNE AND VELAY BUT DIFFER FROM THEM BY THE SUPERINCUMBENT UNBURNT STRATA OF LIMESTONE THIS THEY CALL SCAGLIA OR SCAGLIOLA FROM ITS35 ITS BEING COMPOSED OF THIN SLATY STRATA WHICH ARE OF A YELLOWISH COLOUR AND CONTAIN A FEW VESTIGES OF FOSSIL MA RINE BODIES BUT NO REGULAR BED OF THEM SOMETIMES AN IRREGULAR MASS OF MARBLE IS FOUND AMONG THE SCAGLIA AND NEAR ARQUA PARTICULARLY OF A MOST BEAUTIFUL KIND MUCH RESEMBLING THE NOTED FLORENTINE FIGURED MARBLE WITH THIS FURTHER ADDITION THAT BESIDES THE RUINS IT REPRESENTS IT IS ALSO VARIEGATED BY FREQUENT DENDRITES WHICH IF I MISTAKE NOT ARE VERY UNCOMMON IN THE FORMER PART OF THE TABERNACLE OF THE GREAT ALTAR IN THE CHURCH AT ARQUA IS OF THIS MARBLE WHICH ALSO TAKES A MOST BEAUTIFUL POLISH IF VAUCLUSE NEAR AVIGNON IN FRANCE IS BECOME CELE BRATED FROM THE MEMORY OF THE PLAINTIVE AND ELOQUENT PETRARCH ARQUA OUGHT STILL TO BE MORE SO SINCE NOT ONLY HIS REMAINS LIE THERE IN A LARGE SARCOPHAGUS OF RED VERONESE MARBLE IN THE CHURCHYARD BUT HIS VILLA AT ARQUA IS STILL IN BEING AND PRESERVES SOME PASTORAL AND HISTORICAL FRESCO PAINTINGS OF HIMSELF AND HIS LAURA OF NO INCONSIDERABLE MERIT HIS GREAT ARMED CHAIR AND THE SKELETON OF HIS FAVOURITE CAT ARE ALSO STILL IN BEING THIS VILLA WAS HIS RETREAT DURING HIS RESIDENCE AT PADUA WHERE HE WAS A CANON OF THE CATHEDRAL THE COMMON LAVA IS NOT SO FREQUENT AMONG THE EUGANEAN HILLS AS IN THE PRO VINCES OF AUVERGNE AND VELAY AND SELDOM FORMS INTIRE HILLS WHICH ARE MOSTLY OF GRANITE ON THE SURFACE OF WHICH WHERE THERE IS NO LIMESTONE THE LAVA IS PARTIALLY AND SU PERFICIALLY SCATTERED AND SOMETIMES MIXED EVEN WITH THE MASS OF GRANITE I HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED THAT THE PRIS MATIC GROUP OF MONTE ROSSO IS NEARLY OF THE SAME SORT OF F 2 GRANITE36 GRANITE WITH THE HILL AND IS THE ONLY ONE IN THOSE PARTS THE COMMON VULCANIC TRACTS AFFORDING NOTHING SIMILAR HAVING DWELT SUFFICIENTLY ON THIS GROUP IN THE BEGIN NING OF MY PAPER I SHALL BRIEFLY ADD A FEW OBSERVATIONS ON THE PHYSICAL TOPOGRAPHY OF MONTE ROSSO ITSELF WITH AN ACCOUNT OF SOME OTHER OF ITS VULCANIC PRODUCTIONS NOT LESS CURIOUS THAN THE GROUP OF COLUMNS BEFORE DESCRIBED MONTE ROSSO IS ISOLATED FROM THE PRINCIPAL CHAIN OF THE EUGANEAN HILLS OF AN ORBICULAR FORM AND MEASURES ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF IN CIRCUMFERENCE AT THE BASE IT CON SISTS PRINCIPALLY OF GRAY GRANITE WHICH IS DISPOSED IN BLOCKS AND IRREGULARLY PERPENDICULAR STRATA I HAVE AL READY MENTIONED THE QUALITY OF THIS GRANITE AND ITS RE SEMBLANCE WITH THAT OF AUVERGNE AND VELAY TOWARDS THE SURFACE OF MONTE ROSSO IT APPEARS SOMETIMES ROTTEN OR FRIABLE AND POROUS AS IT WERE LIKE A MOTLEY KIND OF LAVA WHICH I HAVE FREQUENTLY SEEN BUT I WAS SURPRISED ON EXAMINING THE GRANITE MASSES OF MONTE ROSSO TO FIND IN THEM PIECES OF COMMON POROUS BROWN LAVA WHICH DID NOT APPEAR TO BE CASUALLY LODGED THERE AND OF EXTRA NEOUS ORIGIN LIKE THE ROUNDED PEBBLES IN PUDDING STONE AND OTHER AQUEOUS STRATA BUT MANIFESTLY SEEMED TO FORM INTEGRAL PARTS OF THE MASS ITSELF AND TO HAVE CONCRETED WITH IT AT THE SAME TIME I OBSERVED A SIMILAR SORT OF PO ROUS LAVA BUT OF A BLACK COLOUR IN THE GRANITE OF THE CASTLE HILL AT MONCELESE NEAR ESTE AT THE SOUTH EAST SKIRT OF THE EUGANEAN HILLS AND I DOUBT NOT BUT THE SAME IS COMMON TO OTHERS THIS FACT ADDED TO MANY OTHERS WHICH I SHALL NOT INSIST UPON AT PRESENT SEEMS STRONGLY TO37 TO CONFIRM AN OPINION WHICH I HAVE LONG ENTERTAINED OF THE IGNEOUS ORIGIN OF GRANITES IN GENERAL SOME FURTHER PROOFS OF WHICH I SHALL HEREAFTER CONSIDER A DINGY RED OCHROUS EARTH COVERS PARTLY THE SURFACE OF MONTE ROSSO FROM WHENCE PROBABLY PROCEEDS THE NAME GIVEN TO THE HILL ROSSO IN ITALIAN SIGNIFYING RED MUCH IRON SAND ALSO ABOUNDS HERE AS IT COMMONLY DOES ABOUT OTHER VULCANIC AND GRANITE MOUNTAINS OR TRACTS IN GENERAL AMONG THE FIGURED CONCRETIONS OF MONTE ROSSO I OBSERVED A SMALL OPEN PERPENDICULAR BANK AT THE EAST END OF THE HILL WHICH PRESENTED A GROUP OF A VERY PECULIAR STRUCTURE IT IS FORMED BY AN AGGREGATE OF ANGULAR BODIES IATERALLY RANGED TOGETHER LIKE BALSANTINE COLUMNS BUT IN A HORI ZONTAL DIRECTION WITH THEIR TOPS IN FRONT AND PROMINENT AS THEY ARE REPRESENTED IN THE FIGURE M THESE PROMI NENCIES ARE OF A GLOBOSE FORM AND MADE ROUGH BY A NUM BER OF SMALL CRYSTALLIZATIONS OF A PARALLELIPEPID FIGURE THAT ARE CONCRETED IN THE MASS WHICH IS OF A YELLOWISH COLOUR AND RATHER FRIABLE SORT OF VULCANIC SUBSTANCE IN SOMUCH THAT I COULD NOT SEPARATE OR ISOLATE THE BODIES SO FAR AS PRECISELY TO DETERMINE THEIR PARTICULAR FORM THOUGH A CORRESPONDENT CONTINUATION OF THE EXTERNAL ANGLES AP PEARS WITHIN AND THEY SEEM TO CONTRACT A LITTLE PYRA MIDICALLY LIKE THE ISOLATED BODY FIGURED N AND WHICH SEEMS TO BE SOMEWHAT OF THE SAME KIND BUT OF A MUCH HARDER SUBSTANCE THIS IS ALSO FROM A PART OF MONTE ROSSO NEAR THE PRISMATIC COLUMNS THOUGH AS I BEFORE SAID THERE ARE VERY FEW OF THE EUGANEAN HILLS THAT INTIRELY M FIG 2 N FIG 3 CONSIST38 CONSIST OF COMMON BASALTINE OR OTHER LAVA LIKE THOSE OF AUVERGNE VELAY AND THE VICENTINE AND VERONESE TERRI TORIES YET SOME THERE ARE AND VERY CURIOUS WHICH I SHALL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE MONTE NUOVO OR THE NEW MOUN TAIN ABOUT A LEAGUE TO THE SOUTH OF ABANO AND NEAR BAT TAGLIA IS ONE OF THEM THOUGH CONNECTED WITH THE PRIN CIPAL CHAIN OF THE EUGANEAN HILLS BY A DEPRESSED NECK OR ISTHMUS YET IT CONTAINS NO GRANITE OR LIMESTONE LIKE THE REST OF THAT CHAIN BUT IS FORMED EXCLUSIVELY OF LAVA OF VARIOUS KINDS AND DIFFERENT FROM ANY LAVA I OBSERVED ABOUT THESE HILLS GREAT PART OF ITS SURFACE ESPECIALLY ABOUT THE TOP IS VERY ROUGH KNOTTY AND SINUOUS AND MANIFESTLY APPEARS TO HAVE CONCRETED FROM A FUSION BY FIRE THE SKIRTS AND BOTTOMS OF IT EQUALLY PROVE THE SAME CONSISTING MOSTLY OF ANOTHER SORT OF MIXED AND CONGEALED LAVA WHICH THE ITALIANS CALL LAVA BRECCIATA FROM ITS RE SEMBLANCE TO THE BRECCIA MARBLES IT IS FORMED BY MANY BROKEN AND IRREGULAR FRAGMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN ACCI DENTALLY LICKED UP AS IT WERE OR COLLECTED BY THE LAVA WHILE MELTED AND RUNNING AND CONCRETED WITH IT WITH OUT HOWEVER SUFFERING FUSION LARGE BROKEN MASSES OF THIS LAVA ARE SEEN ABOUT THE FOOT OF THE HILL VERY MUCH RESEMBLING FRAGMENTS OF ANCIENT ROMAN BUILDINGS RUIN ED INSOMUCH THAT I MISTOOK FOR SUCH THE FIRST MASS I SAW UNDER A PART OF THE HILL CALLED IL MONTE DELLA CROCE FROM THE CHURCH BUILT UPON IT THE MANNER IN WHICH THE ROMANS WERE ACCUSTOMED TO FILL UP THE INNER PARTS OF THEIR THICK WALLS WITHIN THE FACINGS EXACTLY RESEM BLES THIS KIND OF BRECCIA LAVA SINCE THEY USED IRREGULAR BITS39 BITS OF STONE CONFUSEDLY THROWN INTO AND CEMENTED WITH A LARGE BODY OF MORTAR THIS KIND OF LAVA IS COMMON ENOUGH ABOUT VESUVIUS AND OTHER RECENT VOLCANOS AND ALSO OCCUPIES LARGE TRACTS IN UPPER AUVERGNE ESPECIALLY BETWEEN MURAT AND AURILLAC WHERE IT COVERS THE SKIRTS OF THE HILLS BY THE SIDE OF A VALLEY FOR MANY MILES FORM ING THE MOST GROTESQUE FIGURES IMAGINABLE I HAVE ALSO OBSERVED IT IN PLENTY IN THE ENVIRONS OF PUY IN VELAY THE FAMOUS ST MICHAELS CHURCH AT PUY IS BUILT ON THE SUMMIT OF A HIGH ISOLATED AND ALMOST POINTED ROCK OF THIS LAVA AND MAKES A VERY EXTRAORDINARY APPEARANCE MONTE NUOVO SEEMS TO HAVE SUFFERED A MORE RECENT CON SLAGRATION THAN ANY OTHER OF THE EUGANEAN HILLS AS ITS NAME RATHER IMPLIES BUT THOUGH ITS SKIRTS AND SURFACE APPEAR ALMOST EVERY WHERE TO HAVE SUFFERED A FUSION YET PARTS OF THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE MOUNTAIN MA NIFEST HOWEVER THE PRIMARY HORIZONTAL DIRECTION AND PA RALLELISM OF THE STRATA AS I BEFORE REMARKED OF THE VERO NESE VULCANIC HILLS THIS I PARTICULARLY OBSERVED WITHIN THE PARK OF CATAIO PALACE WHICH IS SITUATED AT THE NORTH EAST EXTREMITY OF MONTE NUOVO AND HAS PARTS OF ITS UN DER APARTMENTS CUT OUT OF THE SOLID ROCK OF LAVA SUP POSING MONTE NUOVO ISOLATED FROM THE LOW NARROW ISTH MUS BEFORE MENTIONED IT WOULD MEASURE ABOUT SIX MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE AT THE BASE I SHALL FURTHER OBSERVE THAT IT FORMS A SORT OF HALF MOON ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE PLAIN NEAR BATTAGLIA AND STANDS IN THE CENTRE OF SEVERAL HOT SPRINGS AS THOSE OF ST ELENA AND SAN BARTOLOMEO TO THE SOUTH AND WEST THOSE OF ABANO AND MONTE ORTONE TO THE NORTH40 NORTH AND MANY OTHERS THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF MONTE NUOVO IS ALSO RENDERED INTERESTING TO NATURALISTS BY ITS FOSSIL GLASS VITRUM OBSIDIANUM PLINII PUMEX VITREUS SO LIDUS LINNAEI WHICH IS FOUND IN PLENTY UNDER THE WEST SIDE OF IT IN A SMALL VALLEY CALLED VAL SAN ZIBIO NEAR THE BATHS OF SAN BARTOLOMEO IT EXACTLY ANSWERS TO THE CHARACTERS GIVEN OF IT BY LINNAEUS AND OTHERS AS MAY BE SEEN BY SOME SPECIMENS OF IT WHICH I HAVE SENT AND WHICH WERE BROKEN FROM A VERY LARGE MASS IT ABOUNDS ABOUT THE VOLCA NOS OF THE ANDES PARTICULARLY BUT I FOUND NONE OF IT IN AU VERGNE VELAY OR THE VERONESE OR VICENTINE VULCANIC HILLS MONTE CASTELLO OR THE CASTLE HILL NEAR BAON AT THE SOUTH EAST SKIRT OF THE EUGANEAN HILLS AND ABOUT HALF A LEAGUE FROM ESTE AFFORDS ANOTHER VULCANIC CONCRETION OF A VERY REMARKABLE STRUCTURE THIS HILL IS MOSTLY FORMED OF HUGE OVAL AND LAMINATED MASSES O OF VARIOUS SIZES CONFUSEDLY CONCRETED TOGETHER LIKE A PUDDING STONE BUT IN A VULCA NIC MATRIX CONSISTING OF A SORT OF DARKBROWN STONE WITH ANGULAR LAPILLI IN IT OF A DINGYWHITISH COLOUR AND VISIBLY MANIFESTING AN AFFINITY WITH THE ORDINARY GRANITE OF THE OTHER NEIGHBOURING HILLS AND PERFECTLY SIMILAR TO THE FI GURED MASSES CONCRETED WITH IT IN OTHER PARTS AND PAR TICULARLY AT MONTE GALDA A SMALL ISOLATED ELEVATION IN THE PLAIN OF PADUA BETWEEN THE EUGANEAN AND VICENTINE HILLS I HAVE FOUND THESE LAMINATED MASSES OF A SPHERICAL FIGURE IN A BROKEN CAVITY OF A MIXED VULCANIC AND MA RINE HILL OF MONTE GALDA I SAW A GROUP OF THESE LAMINATED ROUND BALLS REGULARLY PLACED ONE ABOVE THE OTHER AND O FIG 4 PERPENFIG 2 FIG 1 FIG 4 FIG 3PHILOS TRANS VOL LXVTABIIIP40 41 PERPENDICULARLY IN COLUMNS AS IT WERE THE ANNEXED FI GUREP THOUGH SKETCHED CHIEFLY FROM MEMORY MAY SERVE TO GIVE SOME IDEA OF THIS PHAENOMENON I HAVE OFTEN OB SERVED THE GRANITE OF THE EUGANEAN HILLS PARTICULARLY AF FECTING SUCH ORBICULAR AND LAMINATED FORMS AS MAY BE SEEN IN THE FIGURE Q REPRESENTING A PERPENDICULAR SECTION OF A SIMILAR BANK IN THESE HILLS INDEED FROM THIS AND OTHER FACTS WHICH I HAVE OCCASIONALLY MENTIONED IN THE COURSE OF MY PAPER THERE SEEMS TO BE A STRONG ANALOGY BETWEEN GRANITES AND MANY PARTICULAR VULCANIC CONCRETIONS ANO THER OF THE EUGANEAN HILLS CALLED MONTE ULIVETO OR THE MOUNT OF OLIVE TREES NEAR TEOLO IS CHIEFLY COMPOSED OF A CONFUSED AGGREGATE OF SMALLER GLOBULAR VULCANIC BALLS WHICH ARE RATHER SOLID THAN LAMINATED AND OF A HARD FER RUGINOUS SUBSTANCE OF A DARKBROWN COLOUR MUCH RE SEMBLING SOME COMMON FERRUGINOUS GEODES I HAVE SEEN THE ANNEXED FIGURE R REPRESENTS A GROUP OF THEM THIS MAY SUFFICE FOR A SPECIMEN OF THE MORE CURIOUS VULCANIC PRODUCTIONS OF THE EUGANEAN HILLS AND UNITED TO THE OB SERVATIONS BEFORE MADE MAY PERHAPS SHOW HOW LITTLE WE ARE ACQUAINTED WITH THE STRUCTURE AND RELATIVE PHAENO MENA OF VULCANIC BODIES IN GENERAL I SHALL NOT ENTER INTO ANY ACCOUNT OF OTHER MORE COMMON PRODUCTIONS OF THIS KIND AND SHALL ONLY MENTION THAT DURING MY SUM MERS RESIDENCE AT THE BATHS OF ABANO I MADE A COLLEC TION OF THE EUGANEAN LAVA WHICH IS NOW IN THE PUBLIC MUSEUM AT PADUA SINCE SUCH PRODUCTIONS ARE RATHER CAL CULATED TO ILLUSTRATE THE PHYSICAL TOPOGRAPHY OF THE COUN P FIG 5 Q FIG 6 R FIG 7 V O L LXV G TRY42 RY TO WHICH THEY BELONG THAN TO ADORN A CABINET THEY MUST BE MORE USEFUL UPON THE SPOT THAN THEY POSSIBLY CAN BE ELFEWHERE WHICH CONSIDERATION WILL I HOPE SERVE AS MY APOLOGY FOR NOT HAVING TRANSMITTED THEM TO THE SO CIETY WITH THE OTHER SPECIMENS IT SEEMS RATHER EXTRAOR DINARY THAT SO CURIOUS A TRACT AS THAT OF THE EUGANEAN HILLS WHICH DIFFERS FROM ALL OTHERS IN ITALY SHOULD HAVE REMAINED SO LONG UNKNOWN ESPECIALLY BEING IN THE NEIGH BOURHOOD OF FREQUENTED BATHS AND A CELEBRATED UNIVER SITY FOR THOUGH BACCIUS IN HIS BOOK DE THERMIS SUP POSES SUBTERRANEOUS FIRE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE HEAT OF THE WATERS OF ABANO AND ALSO MENTIONS PUMICE STONES ABOUT THE BATHS THERE YET HE MEANS ONLY THE POROUS AND CAL CAREOUS CONCRETIONS FORMED BY DEPOSITION FROM THOSE WA TERS NOR DOES HE SEEM TO HAVE BEEN AT ALL ACQUAINTED WITH THE INDISPUTABLE VULCANIC PHAENOMENA WHICH THE ADJACENT HILLS IN PLENTY AFFORD NOR DOES VANDELLI EN TER INTO ANY OBSERVATIONS OF THIS KIND IN HIS MORE MO DERN AND EXPRESS TREATISE DE THERMIS PATIVINIS IF WE EX CEPT THE MENTION OF THE FOSSIL GLASS OF VAL SAN ZIBIO WHICH HE SEEMS TO HAVE FIRST OBSERVED I THEREFORE HOPE THAT THE FOREGOING OBSERVATIONS WILL BE THE MORE ACCEPTA BLE IT APPEARS ALSO FROM HENCE IF I MISTAKE NOT THAT THE VENETIAN TERRITORY IN GENERAL ABOUNDS FULL AS MUCH WITH VULCANIC PHAENOMENA AS ANY OTHER PART OF ITALY FOR BESIDES MY OBSERVATIONS IN THE PADUAN VERONESE AND VICENTINE TERRITORIES I HAVE SEEN LAVA IN THE PUBLIC MU SEUM AT PADUA FROM THE BRESCIAN HILLS AND HAVE OBSERV ED LAVA PEBBLES IN QUANTITY IN THE BEDS OF THE RIVERS FLOWING43 FLOWING FROM THE MOUNTAINS OF FRIULI I THEREFORE DOUBT NOT BUT THESE PROVINCES ALSO ABOUND WITH VULCANIC PHAE NOMENA THOUGH I HAVE NEVER HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO VI SIT THEM I MENTION THESE CIRCUMSTANCES MORE WILLINGLY SINCE IT HAS BEEN GENERALLY IMAGINED THAT THE NORTHERN PARTS OF ITALY CONTAINED FEW IF ANY SUCH PRODUCTIONS THEY ARE HOWEVER NOT ONLY FULL AS COMMON BUT IF I MISTAKE NOT MORE INSTRUCTIVE THAN THOSE OF ANY OTHER PROVINCE OF THAT COUNTRY FOR BESIDES THE PHAENOME NON OF MONTE ROSSO ON THE IMPORTANCE OF WHICH I HAVE ALREADY INSISTED AND THE OTHER CURIOUS VULCANIC PRODUC TIONS OF THE EUGANEAN HILLS I MUST OBSERVE THAT FROM THE INORDINATE COURSE OF THE APPENINES IN GENERAL THE VULCANIC HILLS OF THAT CHAIN AFFORD NO OBSERVATION SO IN TERESTING TO PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY AND THE THEORY OF SUCH PHAENOMENA AS THAT BEFORE REMARKED OF THE CORRESPON DENT DIRECTION AND PARALLELISM OF THE VULCANIC AND OTHER BRANCHES OF THE VERONESE AND VICENTINE DISTRICTS MY OBSERVATIONS ALSO ON THE VULCANIC BRANCHES OF THESE DIS TRICTS DO NOT SEEM TO AGREE WITH THE CELEBRATED MONS GUETTARDS PRINCIPLE WHO SUPPOSES S THAT ALL VULCANIC MATERIALS OBSERVABLE IN CALCAREOUS COUNTRIES ARE ADVENTI TIOUS THE CONTRARY OF THIS BEING INDEED DEMONSTRATED BY THE FACTS I HAVE ADVANCED NOR HAVE I ENTERED PARTI CULARLY INTO AN ACCOUNT OF MY VULCANIC TOUR IN THE VENE TIAN STATE THAT I MIGHT NOT ABUSE MYSELF OF THE SUFFERANCE OF SO RESPECTABLE A SOCIETY BY AN

DISTANCE BY THE SIDE OF THE TORRENT BELOW ANOTHER SIMILAR GROUP EXISTED NOR HAVE I THE LEAST DOUBT OF THE FRE QUENCY OF SUCH PHAENOMENA ESPECIALLY IN THE VICENTINE HILLS WHERE VULCANIC EFFECTS ARE MORE COMMON EVEN THAN IN THE NEIGHBOURING TERRITORY OF VERONA FOR OF ALL THE NUMEROUS LINES OR BRANCHES OF MOUNTAINS THAT DIVERGE FROM THE CHAIN OF THE ALPS AND INTERSECT NEARLY IN PAR ALLEL DIRECTIONS THE VICENTINE DISTRICT THERE IS NOT ONE I BELIEVE BUT WHAT CONTAINS MORE OR LESS LAVA AND IN QUANTITY WHEREAS MANY OF THE SAID BRANCHES IN THE VE RONESE TERRITORY ARE EXCLUSIVELY MARINE AND CALCAREOUS ESPECIALLY IN THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF VERONA ABOUT THE VAL PANTENA THE VAL POLICELLA AND TOWARDS THE45 THE ADIGE AND THE VERONESE MOUNTAINS THAT MOSTLY ABOUND WITH LAVA ARE THOSE OF THE EAST AND NORTHEAST QUARTER ABOUT THE CONFINES OF THE VICENTINE TERRITORY IN THE COMMON ROAD FROM VERONA TO VICENZA I FIRST PERCEIVED VULCANIC EFFECTS IN THE ENVIRONS OF CALDIERO WHERE THE HOT SPRINGS RISE THE IMMEDIATE HILLS ABOUT THEM WHICH ARE ISOLATED IN THE PLAIN THOUGH OF LITTLE ELEVATION ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY VULCANIC AS ARE LIKEWISE THE NEIGHBOURING POINTS OF THE ALPINE BRANCHES BEFORE MENTIONED NONE OF THE WRITERS ON THE BATHS OF CALDI ERO TAKE ANY NOTICE OF THESE FACTS THOUGH THEY SEEM AL MOST INSEPARABLE FROM THE CONSIDERATION OF THE ORIGIN AND PROPERTIES OF THOSE WATERS THE SAME DEFECT IS OBSERVA BLE ALSO IN THE WRITERS ON THE HOT SPRINGS NEAR VITERBO WHICH ARE IN THE CENTRE OF VULCANIC HILLS AND ON THE OTHER THERMAE NEAR RADICOFANI IN THE CONFINING PART OF THE TUSCAN STATE WHERE AS I BEFORE OBSERVED VULCANIC EFFECTS ALSO ABOUND THIS NEGLECT INDEED IS BUT TOO COMMON TO OTHER WRITERS ON THERMAE AND MINERAL WATERS IN GENERAL PHYSICAL TOPOGRAPHY SELDOM FORMING A PART OF THEIR IN QUIRIES HOWEVER PERTINENT AND EVEN NECESSARY IN ITSELF HAVING OFTEN HAD OCCASION TO SPEAK OF ABANO IN THE COURSE OF THIS PAPER I CANNOT CONCLUDE IT WITHOUT MEN TIONING AN EXTRAORDINARY PHAENOMENON IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM WHICH IS OBSERVABLE THERE NOTWITHSTANDING THE HEAT OF THOSE WATERS IN WHICH FAHRENHEITS THERMO METER RISES TO EIGHTYEIGHT DEGREES A PARTICULAR SPECIES OF BUCCINUM BREEDS AND LIVES IN THEM AND IS FOUND IN GREAT PLENTY IT IS OF THE FLUVIATILE KIND AND SEEMS TO BE PE CULIAR46 CULIAR TO THESE WATERS HAVING NEVER SEEN NOR HEARD OF THEM IN ANY OTHERS THEY ARE REMARKABLY SMALL SCARCELY EXCEEDING A LINE OR TWO IN LENGTH AND ARE PERHAPS THE SMALLEST UNIVALVE OR TESTACEOUS ANIMAL OF ANY SUCH KIND HITHERTO DISCOVERED IT IS MENTIONED AND FIGURED BY VAN DELLI IN HIS TREATISE DE THERMIS PATAVINIS BUT THE FI GURES ARE NOT GOOD AND MUCH TOO LARGE AS MAY BE SEEN BY THE ORIGINAL SPECIMENS HEREWITH SENT SUCH ARE THE OBSERVATIONS WHICH I HAVE THE HONOUR TO PRESENT TO YOU SIR AND TO THE OTHER LEARNED MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY UPON THE PRESENT OCCASION I SHALL THINK MYSELF VERY HAPPY IF THEY AFFORD ANY SATISFACTION AND MORE PARTICULARLY SO SHOULD THEY BE FOUND CONDU CIVE TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF SO INTERESTING A PROVINCE OF SCIENCE AS THAT OF PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY WHICH BEING GROUNDED UPON FACTS THAT REQUIRE OBSERVATION SEEMS HI THERTO TO HAVE SUFFERED FOR THE WANT OF IT IF CONTRARY TO THE COMMON OPINION I HAVE INSISTED ON THE LOCAL ORIGIN OF MOST VULCANIC TRACTS IT MAY FURTHER BE CONSIDERED THAT THIS SEEMS FULL AS CONSISTENT WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF THEIR ORIGIN AS IT IS AGREEABLE TO THE PHAENOMENA THEMSELVES FOR FIRE NOT ONLY PENETRATES PERVADES DESTROYS AND NEW MODIFIES THE TEXTURE OF THE MOST SOLID BODIES BUT IS ALSO OFTEN GENERATED IN THESE BODIES WITHOUT THE PREVIOUS IN TERVENTION OF OTHER FIRE WHICH CONSIDERATION ALONE MIGHT LEAD US TO THE OPINION I HAVE ADVANCED WERE THERE NOT SUCH EVIDENT PROOFS IN SUPPORT OF IT THESE WILL I HOPE RECEIVE A STRONGER CONFIRMATION FROM A MORE PARTICULAR ACCOUNT OF THE VULCANIC PHAENOMENA OF AUVERGNE AND VELAYFIG 5 FIG 6PHILOSTRANS VOLLXV TABIV P46 FIG 7 47 VELAY WHICH I PROPOSE MYSELF THE HONOUR OF PRESENTING TO THE SOCIETY UPON A FUTURE OCCASION IN THE MEAN TIME I AM WITH GREAT RESPECT AND ESTEEM SIR YOUR MOST OBEDIENT AND VERY HUMBLE SERVANT JOHN STRANGE P S SINCE THE TERMINATION OF THE FOREGOING PAPER I AM INFORMED BY MR CHARLES HAY OF BRECKNOCK IN SOUTH WALES THAT THE PRISMATIC BASALTINE COLUMNS OF TOWEN BEFORE MENTIONED WERE ACTUALLY BROUGHT FROM CADER IDRIS AT THE TOP OF WHICH MOUNTAIN THERE ARE PRO DIGIOUS QUANTITIES OF THEM WHICH ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE ROCKS AROUND THEM THIS INFORMATION MR HAY HAS LATELY RECEIVED FROM A PERSON INFORMED HAVING OBLIGINGLY MADE THE INQUIRY AT MY REQUEST I MAY PER HAPS BE ENABLED HEREAFTER THROUGH THE SAME CHANNEL TO TRANSMIT TO THE SOCIETY A MORE PARTICULAR ACCOUNT OF THE PHAENOMENON PRESUMING THAT IN SOME PART OR OTHER OF CADER IDRIS THESE COLUMNS FORM A REGULAR GROUP AS THEY COMMONLY DO IN OTHER PLACES III AN

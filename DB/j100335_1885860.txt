readers the reopening of the question as to the concept of capital will seem to call for an apology If after so much discussion the fundamental definitions have not been generally agreed upon some will say that further argument on terms and concepts is a waste of time While practical questions of great importance await pro founder study impatience of metaphysical quibbling is pardonable but in recent years many students have felt that there was need of earnest effort to make clearer and more consistent the fundamental concepts These are the tools which aid men to think on economic subjects A flaw in these concepts an unsuspected ambiguity in a word or phrase not only mars the conclusions of the student but affects the popular judgment on the most practical questions The circumstances and special prob lems of former generations have caused the grouping of unharmonized ideas under one term and it is the business of the economist to measure mark and correct the con2 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS cepts to make the parts consistent with each other and the whole fitted to the needs of social discussion The writer believes that there is no economic term to which this statement applies more fully than to capital and this belief is the apology for the present paper The concept of capital holds a central place in every economic system and on its treatment have always depended the leading categories in the theory of economics All agree what ever definition may be held that this is increasingly  a capitalistic age The place therefore of the concept in all practical problems is growing more and more dominant and a better definition of it is the most urgent need of the abstracter branch of economic science I B ORMBAWERK A point of departure admirably fitted for our purpose is found in the Positive Theory of Capital of Bohm Bawerk which was given to the English reading public in 1891 and at once gained a large following There are several advantages in beginning here As the authors purpose was to present not only a theory of interest but as the title indicates a Positive Theory  of Capital we get the most typical crosssection of the study We start with the known and we direct our criticisms not against abandoned errors but against views widely accepted BoihmBawerk undertook in his two large volumes to deal thoroughly with the theories of interest and to do so was led to deal with the concepts of capital for thought be it is capital for which interest is paid How ever much he disputed the relation of production and in terest he had no doubt in undertaking his study as to the relation of capital and interest Interest is the yield of capital in the broader sense and capital the source of  We will note later his abandonment of this idea calling the rent of

terms To clear the field for his own concept of capital B6hmBawerk therefore passes in review the various conceptions of capital that have been employed He begins by following the histori cal order and later groups the concepts in logical ordert In the chapter on historical development he begins with a mention of the medieval view of capital as an inter estbearing sum of money gives a few words to Turgots i saved goods  a very inadequate not to say mistaken interpretation of Turgots view and passes on to Adam Smiths division of these into consumption goods and capital that brings an income In Smiths treatment the author thinks he finds the germ of the productivity theory of interest which he considers false Smith in giving two varieties of the concept capital as a means of ac quisition to the individual and capital as a means of social production has in reality given says B6hm Bawerk two entirely independent conceptions resting substantially on quite different foundations and only con nected externally by a very loose bond t After devot ing several pages to discussing this difficulty the author abandons the historical order and enumerates eight other variations of the concept

goods and what he calls the true instrument of production is essential  Positive Theory p 24 ff t Ibid p 42 if I Ibid p 27  Ibid p 31 ff4 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS that labor must not be confused with capital that land must for many important reasons also be kept distinct and that capital should be looked upon not as a  sum of value hovering over goods but as the complex of goods  itself Among these many variations the author gives his ap proval to that of Adam Smith giving it  a more distinct formulation t however and distinguishing between the wider and narrower conceptions acquisitive private and productive social capital Of the former he says Capital in general we shall call a group of Products which serve as means to the Acquisition of Goods Under this general conception we shall put that of Social Capital as narrower conception t The problem of inter est he thinks is connected with private or acquisitive capital not necessarily with social or productive capital We may

general What judgment now is to be passed on this reading of the capital concept We must be struck by the fact that in the matter of simplicity the results of the authors study are not ideal But he asserts with a tone of tri umph that the conception meets all our logical and terminological requirements Logically it is unassail able  He concludes with this hopeful prophecy If then unbiassed people are ever to agree on the conception of capital we may expect that this will be the one chosen t His strongest ground for such a hope was the fact that he had made a place under the name  capital  for the two most generally employed concepts and that the concept of social capital is the one widely held products used for further production He did not claim much originality for this part of his work He says The heavy part of the Positive Theory of Capital lies in the theory of interest In the other portions of the subject he seems to mean the concept of capital I was able at least on the whole to follow in the footsteps of previous theorists t The immediate reception of this portion of the authors work largely justified his hopes His careful restatement of the concept and the authority of his name undoubtedly  Positive Theory p 59 t Ibid p 60 t Ibid Preface p xxiii6 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMIICS added to the prestige it already enjoyed The more usual point of attack on the author has been his interest theory not his capital concept which has been far less ques tioned in fact has usually been accepted as flawless Some protests however have already been raised against it and although it is still the dominant concept discon tent with this and other features of the older economic thought has been spreading The earnest teacher using the available textbooks and attempting to correct their treatment in accord with recent criticisms is in despair To one who has watched the course of the discussion it might seem that the service of BMhmBawerks work so far as it touches the capital concept lay not in settling but in reopening the whole question Remembering however that most students still accept BohmBawerks statement of the concept we turn to a group of thinkers who would give other readings to it and we shall con fine our study to the leading representatives of two differ ing views on the question II J B CLARK This part of the Austrian writers work especially was attacked by Professor John B Clarkt who defends the productivity theory of interest though that point we need not raise in this paper His own views had been published t at the same time as the German edition of the Positive Theory of Capital but more attention was at tracted to them it is probable as a result of this contro versy than at their first publication I shall not enter into the merits of the discussion as a whole It was carried on  Eg Horace White on  BohmBawerk on Capital Political Science Quarterly vii 133148 General Walker  B1hmBawerks Theory of Inter est in Quarterly

1888RECENT DISCUSSION OF THE CAPITAL CONCEPT 7 with great skill with some later confessed misunderstand ings and at times perhaps with an oversubtlety which makes it exceedingly difficult to follow I shall simply try to state the issue involved as to the capital concept In everyday speech and in the writings of economists there have been since before the time of Adam Smith two broadly marked ways of thinking of capital one views it as concrete goods such as tools and machines the other as the money expression or market value of the goods It is probable that no writer has long kept from the use of the term in both these ways no matter what his formal definition Frequently both uses will be found on the same page A few writers only have chosen to frame their capital concept in accord with the second of these ways of thinking BMhmBawerk has taken the former way defining capital as the concrete goods and in the interest problem he insists on the need of comparing goods of like kind and quantity Clark declares this to be an error and defines capital in harmony with the second way of thinking of it He says  There is in ex istence a permanent fund of productive wealth expres sible in money but not embodied in money and it is this that business men designate by the term capital t The concrete things which make up this fund he calls  capital goods In contrast with this list of goods he often speaks of his kind of capital as  true capital or  pure capital which as he says elsewhere  resides in many unlike things but consists of a single entity that is common to them all That entity is  effective social utility t Again he says SCapital goods are   vanishing elements True capital    is abiding  Elsewhere he clothes his defi nition which he calls the common and practical sense of the term in these words  Capital is an abiding fund of wealth employed in production 11 Positive Theory pp 33 34 t Yale Review ix 307 X Publications of American Economic Association iii 91  Yale Review ii 308 11 Quarterly Journal of Economics ix 2578 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS Needless to say BohmBawerk defends himself vigor ously against the charge of  sidetracking  the theory of capital in defining the concept as he had done The con troversy turned about the phrase  goods of like kind and quantity and the question as to the real nature of the comparison of present and future goods Clark holds that it is two sums of  quite different goods  that are com pared BMhmBawerk saves his phrase by the expedient of making the goods of like kind and quantity mean dollars exactly as does Professor Clark  This is not a novelty with him for as he points out4f he had in many and in some of the most important passages of the Positive Theory of Capital   used money as an illustra tion of the proposition that present are worth more than future goods Without quite endorsing Clarks comment on this point we may agree with him that this appears to surrender the entire question concerning the formula  of like kind and quantity t What meaning is in the phrase  the technical superiority of present goods over future goods when those goods are made to mean dollars What becomes of the elaborate analysis of the roundabout method of production  Certainly it means something very different when the present goods employed are taken merely as circulating medium which is not in the normal case retained by the individual producers nor used up by society The truth is BMhmBawerk had fallen into the common error of using two different conceptions of capi tal and at the first attack was found in an untenable position This phase of the controversy seems to end by showing that the conception of capital made use of by BohmBawerk himself when he discusses business prob lems takes the money expression and differs in important ways from that of concrete goods expressed in his elabo rately framed definition A word as to the relation of these two views It is to be noted that both parties  Quarterly Journal of Economics ix 116 t Ibid 380 t Ibid 263  Positive Theory pp 1723RECENT DISCUSSION OF THE CAPITAL CONCEPT 9 agree that economists must study wealth under both these aspects BMhmBawerk admits that he does so The point against him is that while framing his concept and basing his argument as to interest on the first he introduces the second view in some ways inconsistent without recogniz ing the shift of concept And Clark says that  the issue is not whether concrete capital goods are or are not to be studied at all For certain purposes they have to be studied  But he would confine the term  capital  to the sum of wealth or permanent fund constituted of the perishable goods The conception championed by Clark is of great signifi cance and before going further it is important to con sider some peculiarities and difficulties in Clarks way of setting it forth 1 The discussion is confined by Clark at the outset to social capital He uses this term in a wider sense than BMhmBawerk does as is explained in the next paragraph but not differently as to the exclusion of consumption goods Social capital is that kind which B6hmBawerk himself considers to be productive Clark gains thus a distinct tactical advantage over his opponent in uphold ing the productivity theory of interest though that is not of immediate importance to us here The fact however that BohmBawerk does not note this limitation but fights the issue on the ground chosen by his adversary shows that he himself is caught in the confusion of the two con cepts and is the strongest evidence of the inexpediency of the division of capital into social and privatet On the other hand the fact is of immediate interest to us that Clark gives this narrower content to the term capital confining capital to  material forms of wealth that do not directly minister to consumers wants and does not make a place for acquisitive consumption goods nor ex  Quarterly Journal of Economics ix 258 t Yale Review ii 304 1 A fuller discussion of this point is given later p 21  Yale Review ii 30710 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS plain the interest from them as is done by BbhmBawerk in his concept of private capital In this respect the con cept evidently needs addition or correction 2 In the second place Clarks explanation of the gene sis of capital is inconsistent with his own concept Land used productively for example a farm a waterfall a mine any rare and useful natural agentis capital ac cording to his definition In his earlier utterances such things are in plain words included In the later articles this is still the inevitable implication of the definition a fund of productive wealth expressible in money but a reader new to the authors doctrine would find no specific statement to this effect and there would be small chance that the meaning in question would be gathered The whole logic of the argument is against it  The genesis of capital we are told takes place by a process for which the good old term  abstinence is as I venture to maintain the best designation t This does not seem to give a place in capital to natural agents There are we are told two classes of accumulators the typical capital ists who save to make permanent additions to their capital and the quasicapitalists who  save sums now intending to spend them later t There is no place here for the unearned increment of a newly discovered mine which today forms for many men the chief productive wealth expressible in money If this is saving it is a sense so un usual as to require a special explanation by the author and it is difficult to see how it can consistently be given There certainly would be no attempt to evade the real question by assuming that the dollars that bought the mine had been saved for the mine may not have been sold and if so it is irrelevant to the issue If the defini tion adopted by Clark is consistently applied there are necessarily many things forming a part of capital which never have been saved and which never have called for  Publications of American Economic Association iii 95 112 t Yale Review ii 3093 1 Ibid 303 304RECENT DISCUSSION OF THE CAPITAL CONCEPT 11 abstinence as Clark employs that term In fact Clark seems to show here as did BihmBawerk some traces of the error of the labor theory of value so difficult to throw offt 3 Again Clark would seem to err by extreme state ment in making it in the nature of capital to be a  per manent fund  In creating capital we put the personal good away from us forever   An addition to the social fund of perpetual capital is brought into existence  Nothing generates capital that does not add to the perma nent fund of invested wealth t  True capital    is in the absence of untoward accidents perpetual and yields perpetual fruits  Many other expressions emphasize the same thought Now this evidently does not apply at all to the authors quasicapitalist who saves to spend later That of course is why he uses the term  quasi which evades the issue Either such savings are capital in which case why quasi or they are not capital and may be omitted from the concept The author after stating that a part of the accumulation of capital is due to these quasicapitalists proceeds as if there were none such If better or more tools and larger stocks were ac cumulated and were then allowed to deteriorate while in use without being replaced our author must certainly call them capital while they lasted and if so the element of permanency is no essential part of the capital concept Indeed if a fund of productive wealth must be permanent to be capital we cannot be sure that there is any such a thing for we have not the gift of prophecy and all  Yale Review ii 309 I must dissent from Clarks opinion that the term  abstinence  is in the discussion of value theories to be applied only to the first act of saving See this view in Quarterly Journal ix 260 261 In a more useful sense it is a power of choice that is continuously present during the foregoing of the right to consume wealth at every moment during which a man could convert the principal of interestbearing capital into a source of present enjoy ment t This point is treated more fully later p 30 X Yale Review ii 309  Ibid 31212 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS human interests are fleeting Clark himself says C Capi tal     normally will never perish but this is not saying that no capital ever perishes in fact t This says clearly enough that permanency is not an essential mark of the concept and makes meaningless both the word itself in that connection and a number of sentences be sides those quoted in which this feature is emphasized as a vital mark of the concept There is a valid thought in his contention but it is not that capital is in its nature per petual There is ambiguity in the phrases  increase of capital and decrease of capital because they may mean either some of the parts or the whole A part of capital may perish while the total amount of capital is preserved or even increased Clark would confine the ex pression to the whole of capital and objects to the form of statement capital is destroyed when the value of the concrete goods is passed on to other goods But what of the cases where the total value is not preserved The zeal of his attack carries him to an extreme and untenable expression and makes him insist upon an unessential 4 Less successful than his contention against B6hm Bawerk about goods of like kind and quantity  is Clarks claim that capital  synchronizes all industry and its fruition that because of capital industry and its fruition are simultaneous There are several objections to such an expression a I am not quite in sympathy with the point of view of either of the parties to the discussion but between them it is a question not as to what happens not of fact but of expression and BbhmBawerks opinion commends itself when he says  it is a  figure of speech  that is  misleading  to say that the real wages consisting of  consumption goods  received today for work done on goods not to be completed for years are the  true and  This has already been observed by Fisher Economic Journal vi 530 t Yale Review ii 309 t See further on this infra pp 1516  Quarterly Journal of Economics ix 124 125RECENT DISCUSSION OF THE CAPITAL CONCEPT 13 immediate fruit  of eg the tanners labor To the tan ner of course they are the  immediate  and only fruits since they are all he gets for his labor The question is does it seem logical and expedient from the general stand point in economic discussion to consider and speak of them as the true fruits  of that days labor The ex pression chosen appears to say merely that these things express the present market value of the laborers services that is it is a roundabout and somewhat whimsical way of stating the truism that they are the mans wages b Further it may be urged that the inaptness of this expression is more apparent when something other than subsistence goods are considered In the example chosen of the tanner it is at least debatable whether it is best to call the shoes he gets today the  true fruit  of his labor But in the case of the laborer receiving food and clothing for digging a canal or working on a marble palace it is straining the point further to use the expression If here too his wages are called the  true fruit  of his labor it still appears that the peculiar power ascribed to capital is due only to one part of capital the finished consumption goods No matter how large a stock of capital in the form of machines buildings and raw materials may be on hand if there be no stock of finished goods labor and its results are not synchronizedt c A further objection to this way of conceiving of the nature of capitals work is that it would if true be appli cable only to  produced  forms of capital As indicated by the phrases  industry and its fruition  labor and its fruits it implies vaguely the labor theory of value as to the origin of capital The picture of labor continuously flowing into the reservoir of capital and consumption goods at the same time flowing out t is not satisfactory as  Yale Review ii 312 f This is a somewhat different presentation of BohmBawerks argument in Quarterly Journal of Economics ix 125128 X Yale Review ii 310 31114 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS applied to products for it implies that the inflow of a quantity of labor forces out consumption goods whose quantity is determined or measured by the quantity of in flowing labor The value of consumption goods flowing out however is greater in varying degrees than the value of labor flowing in and it is only through their values that we can compare at all the quantities of the two streams Further it is not a happy figure for it suggests that all the goods that are a part of capital will eventually become consumption goods whereas in many cases this is not expected nor desired It is significant that Clark in describing the process speaks only of  the materials raw and partly wrought of which an article for consumption is made He ignores machines and durable goods It is only in the gradual passing on of their value as they are used up to the things that are made by them that machines and more durable agents can be said to ripen at all Even Clarks value conception of capital however though it explains this point better than does the concrete con cept of capital does not avoid the difficulty The point may be most clearly seen in the case of natural agents which as we have noted are in Clarks treatment included in the  fund  of capital If we consider not merely capital in the form of products more or less fitted for consumption but as his concept requires durable natural agents also the phrases we are criticising appear hardly short of ab surd Clark forgets this kind when he says  The capital goods that are set working are not permanent They pass away and are replaced t Natural agents the field the waterfall in so far as they are thought of apart from betterments upon them have not been originated by labor and they are not in a state of transformation that will eventually ripen them into consumption goods  BbhmBawerk appears to have very much the same conception of prod ucts ripening into consumption goods in his circles of production periods See Positive Theory 93 106108 t Yale Review ix 312RECENT DISCUSSION OF THE CAPITAL CONCEPT 15 They stand there to be used by man if he wishes as an aid in securing future harvests or products but neither the things themselves nor their value or money expression are  synchronizing  labor and its fruits If there is any synchronizing it is done not by this but by some other part of capital and is therefore not an essential mark of the capital concept 5 It is likely that to some points in what has been thus far said the answer will be made that they are due to misunderstanding of the authors meaning No doubt the author attaches great weight to the contrast he draws between true capital and capital goods which it might seem I had neglected The reply is a criticism stronger perhaps than any of the foregoing against Clarks capital concept There is in his mode of thinking of this con trast an overabstraction that is neither expedient nor logical and there results in his presentation some incon sistency of thought and statement In some passages capital is said to be as concrete a thing as can be It  consists in goods It is not an abstraction and it is not a force independently of matter It has substance If at any instant we could collect in one place all the material forms of wealth that do not directly minister to con sumers wants we should have the fund for the moment before our eyes in substantial embodiment  Capital is thus productive wealth expressible in money but not embodied in money t That is plain enough and we are still on solid ground we are not puzzled here by the entity effective social utility of the earlier statements where capital does not consist of the concrete things but is the fund that resides in many unlike things and is embodied in instruments of production This has the unpleasant flavor of Marxs labor jelly though it need not be taken as more than a loose convenient way of expressing the market value of the concrete things But  Yale Review ii 307 t Ibid t Publications of American Economic Association iii 1116 QUARTERLY JOURNVAL OF ECONOMICS the development that follows of the paradoxical contrasts between capital goods and true capital appears to be mis chievous subtlety The very adjectives true and pure  applied to capital are suspicious Why not plain capital We are told that the genesis of capital goods is unlike that of capital  It would seem that if capital consists of concrete goods then making concrete goods is making capital But the author says not unless those goods are net additions to the stock that is more than replace the capital destroyed in the same time 1 Build an altogether new engine That is creating capital Renewing an old one is only preserving capi tal t The simple mode of expression that some capital has been created while an equal amount has been de stroyed is thus not to be permitted Surely since cap ital has substance and consists in goods there is only one way in which its amount can be preserved while some of it is being destroyed and that is by creating more capital to replace that destroyed And what would be the circle within which the balance must be struck Would it be the individual the national or the world economy If John builds a machine while his neighbor lets one decay then has John created no capital It is true that care is often needed in speaking of any increase to indicate whether it is a net increase or not but no more needed in the case of a  fund of capital  than in that of a herd of cattle The striking antithesis of the goods that make up capital with the capital itself appears thus to be overabstraction and unreality To sum up the objections to Clarks conception of capi tal t 1 It includes only goods used in production and  Yale Review ii 308 t Quarterly Journal of Economics ix 275 t This article was in the editors hands before the appearance of Professor Clarks latest work The Distribution of Wealth The views of

recognize nor prepare to explain the interest bearing qualities of consumption goods 2 It is confused in attributing the genesis of capital to abstinence as he uses that word while including in capital natural agents for whose origin no abstinence was required 3 It errs in making permanency or perpetuity an es sential mark of capital 4 The statement that an important if not the chief function of capital is to synchronize industry and its fruition is a misleading figure of speech It can be affirmed even figuratively only of the part of produced goods that is to be at once consumed and is quite mean ingless as applied to the durable natural agents which are a part of his capital concept 5 The conception starting from concrete goods is developed away from them into a more abstract demateri alized pure  or  true  capital which is put into contrast with real things III IRVING FISHER We now turn to the notable contribution of Professor Irving Fisher He lays a basis for his own treatment with sound statements as to the requisites of a good definition and careful studies of the definitions and usage of the leading authorities He believes that a mistake has been made as to the real character of the problem that it is not one of the classification of wealth and that unavoid able difficulties attend every effort to delimit capital from  other wealth t His own conclusion then is that capital should be taken to mean simply all wealth at a point of time4 It is contrasted not with other wealth for that category is exhausted but with the same wealth as a flow

flow and still more important  between stock and rate of flow  This con ception is ingeniously developed use being made of mathematical terminology and is applied in criticism of rival definitions Finally the attempt is made to show how it could be employed in the discussion of various economic questions To grasp more fully the import of this radical proposal in economic terminology let us note in what regards it differs from the conceptions we have been considering 1 Its content is wider than that of any foregoing con cept BMhmBawerk excludes all natural agents and most consumption goods from his wider concept private capi tal and excludes the other consumption goods used in acquisition from the narrower concept of social capital Clark appears at first to include all natural agents though excluding all consumption goods then treats capital as if it originated only in labor and did not include natural agents and finally mystifies us by his contrast of capital goods and pure capital leaving us in doubt whether he would include any concrete things as such Fishers con cept takes them all in sweeps down the wall between the old concept of capital and consumption goods on the one hand and natural agents on the other To my mind this suggestion is the most fertile part of Fishers discussion 2 It agrees with B6hmBawerks and differs from Clarks conception in considering that the concrete things should be estimated by physical measurements and not in their money expression The objection to Clarks view in this regard he says  is not that this summation of value is inadmissible but that it is a secondary operation Ob jects of capital are antecedent to the value of those objects    Wheat must be measured in bushels before it is measured in dollars t He therefore finds it a  serious objection to Clarks definition  that he endeavors  to in e Economic Journal vi 515 t Ibid p 530RECENT DISCUSSION OF THE CAPITAL CONCEPT 19 elude different sorts of capital in the same fund reduced to a common equivalent in terms of value Here in my opinion is a radical defect in Fishers view a It is true that wheat must be measured in bushels before it can be measured in dollars but it must also be tested for quality One will not value as highly a small apple as a large one a sour as a sweet one a rotten as a sound one We could thus say that apples must be measured in sweetness be fore being measured in value But an inventory of all possible measurable qualities while helpful in estimating would not itself express the amount of capital for the things might after all have no value at all b Though an intelligible description of the quantity of any single kind of goods could be made in such terms yet the total quantity of many different kinds of goods cannot be expressed for economic purposes in a single sum except ing in terms of value A capital account in which five pounds of feathers were added to a bushel of wheat and a yard of cloth would give a curious total c Fisher is inevitably betrayed into inconsistency when he comes to estimate the quantities of wealth and express in percent ages the relation between the stock and rate of flow for this can be done only by comparison of values 3 This conception shares what I believe to be an error common with it to both of the otherst in that it makes the income of a community consist of  streams    of the very same commodities  4 that compose the total capital This again implies that all things of value originate in labor and are on their way towards the goal of consump tion goods whereas many things standing where they are may be made to push other things towards that goal though never getting nearer to it themselves e g ma chines and natural agents Fisher means by income a  flow of things

QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS satisfactions The bookkeeping of society will be thrown badly out of balance if services be not counted as a part of income but even if services be included as a part both of income and of capital at a point of time there are still many things as above indicated that are a part of Fishers capital only and never are a part of the flow of income They never have been made for consumption and never will be fitted for consumption 4 A final objection is that the term  capital  is made synonymous with wealth and two good words are em ployed in the same sense Fisher anticipates this objec tion and recognizing its validity if the fact be true de fends by saying that wealth presents the two aspects of income and stock capital differences important enough to merit separate terms This defence fails if the point made in the preceding paragraph is sound By wealth Fisher must mean here  all wealth As I have shown all capital must be considered wealth and all wealth capital by Fishers definition though all wealth has not been nor will all wealth become income Wealth and capital thus are synonymous while income differs from them not merely as an aspect but in the group of goods which com poses it The concept under discussion is credited in part to Professor Simon Newcomb is indorsed in the main by Mr Edwin Cannan and has received the approval of Professor Hadley in his Economics Its merits and the ability of its presentation by Fisher have surely attracted other followers to one or another feature of it It has therefore a worthy standing among the competing conceptions Some portions of the presentation are most illuminating and must be looked upon as distinct contributions to economic theory Careful distinction between a stock of capital

But this difficulty is not such as to call for the construction of the capital con cept with that distinction as the central thought On the whole there is little probability that this conception will triumph its defects both as to consistency and expediency being of an essential nature its points of merit being capable of adaptation to another and better central thought We now have finished our review of the more notable recent conceptions rivals to that put forward by Wihm Bawerk Though confined to a few names it has neces sarily taken a somewhat wide range in the points consid ered It is hoped to use the fruits of this study in the next two divisions in which the analysis of BWhmBa werks conception is resumed I shall then go on to formulate more positively a capital concept which will be free I trust from the many objections that have been considered IV PRIVATE AND SOCIAL CAPITAL AN ILLOGICAL DISTINCTION I have sought in the foregoing to give a clear statement to the capital concept of BbhmBawerk and its recent rivals those of Professors Clark and Fisher to show the main points of difference and finally to criticize in some detail the conceptions of these later writers We are now prepared to return to the criticism of BMhmBawerks views which were the startingpoint of our study and taking up more thoroughly than before some of the issues involved in his definition to work towards a positive con clusion The distinction between private and social capital is considered by BMhmBawerk to be of the very greatest importance and he deems his clear distinguishing of them to be one of his highest services to economic theory The failure to distinguish them he thinks is the chief22 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS reason for the  false  productivity theory of interest If the difference is not seen between capital the source of interest and capital the tool in production interest he argues is naturally thought to be due to productivity But if it is clearly seen that a part of interestbearing capital is not a tool in production then productivity can not be the one essential explanation of interest This point was evaded by Clark as I have shown  for he simplyl considers social or productive capital and omits mention of acquisitive consumption goods It was not raised in his discussion with Clark by BbhmBawerk him self for his attention was fixed on other points but in his reply to Walker it is put very clearly There is in terest without any production whatever   I refer for example to interest on consumption loans and to the re turn on durable consumption goods such as rented houses pianos and the like t Private capital is by his view social or productive capital plus some other things enjoy able and more or less durable products let for hire to the user Of what importance is this class of goods that makes all the difference between the two concepts He has here mentioned rented houses and pianos the stock illustration is the masquerade suit let by the costumer A complete list of these articles would include a very small amount of wealth compared with that in social capi tal and doubtless very much less than that in the rest of consumption goods Yet it would be wrong to claim on this account that it is not worth while to make a difference in the concept Logical differences of any importance call for distinctions in concepts no matter how slight be the quantitative differences I pass therefore to a criti cism of the logical grounds for such a distinction 1 There is no need to make an independent concep tion on

23 simpler way Here are two houses lived in by the owners in two neighboring towns They are called consumption goods bearing no income Owner A moves into another house paying 300 rent letting his own for an equal sum His house then becomes acquisitive capital Owner B does the same and his house becomes capital Chance or choice leads each to occupy the others house Each through a broker and without knowing who his tenant is pays the other 300 yearly and both houses are capital Shortly they move back into their own houses which at once cease to be capital and the income  of each man is reduced 300 The puzzle is an old one It compels us to say that a thing becomes capital or ceases to be capital not be cause of any change in its physical or economic nature not because it is more or less serviceable to the com munity not because the use to which it is put is al tered but simply because the man who owns it does or does not happen to be the one who enjoys that use Now BMhmBawerk himself in his interest theory has given us a hint of the way such an absurdity can be avoided with out the use of a separate concept though he does not see the application possible here The person who rents a house buys the  material services  of the thing during a definite period The whole value of the house is simply the sum of a long series of uses To the logical eye though not to the technical eye of the law the tenant or user is the owner of the thing during the time with only such conditions as will insure its safe keeping and return at the close of the period It may be looked upon as a sale to the tenant of a use or a group of uses defined by a period of time and with the agreement to return the use bearer when a group that has not been purchased begins to mature The value of the unpurchased uses does not appear in the transaction but they are bound up with the  Especially in Positive Theory 33934924 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS usebearer that is given and returned The dancer is often compelled to deposit the price of the masquerade suit when he takes it out After the ball is over his subjec tive valuation having fallen he is the gainer by returning it at an agreed price which to the costumer represents its worth as stock to him The latter keeps such things in stock because there are on an average enough such sales to pay his trouble expenses and a return on that amount of stock Such rented consumption goods being owned for the time by the user form then no exception to the general class of consumption goods The income of the dealer or the house owner is explained as a profit gained in exchange like that of any other retail merchant and in cludes a payment for services risk and income from stock employed To explain such transactions as the sale of a group of uses which is actually the temporary sale of the usebearer is entirely consistent with B6hm Bawerks treatment of interest and makes needless the elaborate distinction between private and social capital 2 The foregoing would seem to be a valid reply at all events as an argumentum ad hominem to BThmBawerk but it may appear to some to be too elaborate and artificial The distinction in question may then be attacked on the still stronger ground that it confuses things economic and legal It is based on an unclear view of the relations of economic and contract interest Let us look at this dis tinction Contract interest is the interest actually paid by one person to another as the result of an agreement Economic interest is the advantage attributable to the pos session and use of a thing during a given period regardless of its ownership There is economic interest when a man uses his own plough to raise a crop or his own storeroom as a place of business Now in the case of all the things included under social productive capital contract is based on and tends to conform to economic interest In all  I should add if the income is estimated as a percentage of the capital valueRECENT DISCUSSION OF THE CAPITAL CONCEPT 25 such cases it is economic interest that we seek to explain logically through the economic nature of the goods Con tract interest is a secondary problem a business and legal problem as to who shall have the benefit of the income arising with the possession of the goods It is closely connected with the question of ownership Only by acci dent mistaken judgment or old agreements can the con tract interest connected with social capital continue when economic interest does not The two are related as cause and effect Yet in the case of the relatively small group of consumption goods let for hire there is in the current view here represented by BMhmBawerk only contract inter est there being supposed to be no economic interest on which it is based The economists problem in distribu tion is essentially an impersonal one to determine the economic contribution regardless of the question of legal ownership Here if it be held that there is no economic interest or contribution we have an anomalous case where the final answer to the interest problem must contain a mixture of economic and legal elements No solution of this contradiction will I believe be found short of the view that contract and economic interest are normally inseparable By normally I mean that no man con tracts to pay interest or being free to choose actually does pay it unless he has reason to believe that he thereby will gain the benefit of what must be called economic in terest of a somewhat greater amount 3 This brings us to another objection to the distinc tion between social and private capital namely that it involves a wrong conception of the nature of income I shall maintain that income must be looked upon as a series or group of satisfactions not as a series or group of material things Though scattered authority may be found for this view it is at variance with the views alike of BdhmBawerk of Clark and of Fisher as well as those of the great majority of economists and requires explana26 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS tion and defence The thesis is that the economic goods which are  produced  either by human effort or by the material services of goods must in their last analysis be looked upon as satisfactions BohnmBawerk notices this view as expressed by Roscher and rejects it  yet the view is one peculiarly in harmony with the psychological treatment of value which B1lhmBawerk favors Indeed it seems to me the view to which that value theory logi cally and inevitably leads Roscher fails to apply this thought consistently as BMhmBawerk rightly shows t and with that we will not concern ourselves The view suggested looks upon all material goods as means of pro duction or capital their value being derived from the states of satisfaction to which they minister or which they enhance BMhmBawerks objection to this lacks valid ity He says Any unbiassed person can see how un fortunate this is Without due cause it obliterates the very important distinction between the production of goods which satisfy want and their consumption It christens for example the idler as a zealous producer always thinking how he may produce the personal goods of satiety of ease of contentment and so on It needs only to be replied to this that the idler in such case would be wrongly christened The term means of pro duction must be confined to objective means of pro ducing a subjective state not to subjective states to Buddhistic dreams that unite the dreamer with Nirvana The pleasure of basking in the sun is a fact of which economic theorists must take note but that pleasure can be secured usually by the use of free goods and thus is not an economic satisfaction It becomes an economic satisfaction when it is conditioned on the control of some scarce material agent or can be secured only by effort The test then of economic personal goods or satisfactions is dependence on either objective things or persons or on  Positive Theory p 44 t Ibid p 45RECENT DISCUSSION OF THE CAPITAL CONCEPT 27 reaction against the outer world by the man seeking the satisfaction If the objection of BMhmBawerk is urged beyond the extreme and inapplicable example he has given and is applied to the personal services of one man for another it leads to the old and abandoned distinction between productive and unproductive labor We do christen many men as zealous producers because they are producing the personal goods of satietyin other men Such services must be counted as ephemeral forms of wealth enjoyed or consumed at the moment of their production This is no more obliterating the distinction between production and consumption than eating a hot cake fresh from the griddle obliterates that distinc tion The two things are as logically separable in thought when they occur simultaneously as when a second or a decade intervenes We have ceased to con sider it essential to  productive  labor that it should be first embodied in material form however fleeting The same untenable distinction is adhered to almost univer sally in the case of the services of material goods Their productive contributions must be put on the same basis as those of labor to be measured by the intensity of the wants they aid in satisfying and the psychic states they help to produce The house of the millowner is logi cally considered producing directly his mill is producing indirectly for only after a devious journey will the con tribution of the mill reach its goal in the satisfaction of wants Our economic bookkeeping can be made to balance only when real income be looked upon as a flow of pleasure in all cases not as a flow of goods in some and a flow of pleasures in others as is done generally now 4 This view makes possible the correction in the con cepts of private and social capital of another fault which calls for our fourth and last objection to this part of the almost universally accepted treatment The fault is this Interest is looked upon as connected with a special class28 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS of goods it must be recognized to be connected with everything of value The value of anything is built up on its uses or services to men Wherever there is a post poned use that use is subject to a discount Its present worth is less than its worth will be at maturity Consider the case of consumption goods In the orthodox view a bushel of apples kept by the grocer from fall till spring is capital and normally shows economic interest in en hanced value Bought in the fall and stored in the cellar by the housewife it is a consumption good and economic interest is absent But that early purchase can only be rationally explained as we take account of the increment of value on the apples thus stored and this is economic interest Larger purchases in advance effect of course economy of labor and bring an additional motive to make them but this is not saying that the whole saving is wages and that no interest is gained The radical consequences of this view are evident It erases all distinction between the essential economic char acter of socalled productive and consumption goods The term  consumption goods  may still be conveniently re tained to mean as at present the material good in its final form in the hands of the one intending to use it but it ceases to be an essential economic category Every material good and every human service has value only as it is a condition to the satisfying of a present or prospective want The abiding value of the diamond is built on no more sub stantial foundation than its flash and sparkle Market values are the capitalized economic contribution of objec tive agents to psychic states and these states are the final highest only essential economic products To sum up the objections to the concepts of private and social capital 1 The distinction between them rests on a supposed Here we develop some of the thoughtful suggestions of Fisher though differing with his view in ways already suggested See Economic Journal vii 525RECENT DISCUSSION OF THE CAPITAL CONCEPT 29 difference in the interestbearing character of different groups of consumption goods This difference can be ex plained in a simple way that makes needless an additional concept 2 The distinction between them rests on legal not on economic grounds and involves a confusion of economic and contract interest 3 The distinction rests on an incomplete and illogical view of the nature of income and the services of goods The income that needs to be explained by economic theory is the flow of objectively created pleasures coming to the individual and the community 4 In these concepts the interestbearing quality is confined to the conventional production goods and such consumption goods as yield contract interest Many ac tions connected with consumption goods are left un explained The interest phenomenon is found wherever there is abiding value Our conclusion then is that the distinction between social or productive and private or acquisitive capital rests on illogical grounds BohmBawerk thinks it a great advantage that notwithstanding the material difference there is between capital the factor of production and capital the source of interest it is not necessary in his reading to make two conceptions of capital that are en tirely foreign to one another  We must assert on the other hand that the two conceptions he has given us are so largely foreign to one another t that instead of an ad vantage it is a source of much confusion that they are called by the same name as every careful reader of Bohm Bawerks work must have noted For example he defines capital at the beginning of his discussion t as nothing  Positive Theory p 40 f Ibid p 61 He says here flatly contradicting his own words just quoted  Substantially the conception of social capital is a quite indepen dent conception In every essential respect in definition in scientific employ ment and in scope it stands on entirely independent principles t Ibid p 2230 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOM3ICS but the complex of intermediate products which appear on the several stages of the roundabout journey By this he evidently means his social capital and he then proceeds to show that  capital in general  that is private capital is something more than such a complex The reader is frequently in doubt which one of these different concepts is designated when the word  capital  is used A great advantage will be gained when dropping un essential distinctions we are able to save the term from double meanings V CAPITAL AS PRODUCT THE LABORVALUE FALLACY Thus far we have considered only the question of the uses to which goods are put as determining whether they are capital WihmBawerks definition however in common with nearly all usage limits the conception of capital in another way namely with regard to its origin As well private as social capital consists of a group of products In the foregoing I have widened the term productive as applied to consumption goods but the products there mentioned feelings satisfactions being ephemeral do not increase the capital stock existing at a given moment And being final products these states of feeling cannot be used in further economic processes and do not therefore widen the definition BdhmBawerk has given us The test so far applied to these concepts has been alone that of economic function Confining capital to material  products as does BohmBawerk applies an additional and distinct test that of economic origin and must be separately examined The purpose of the adjective  produced  in the phrase produced means of production  is to exclude land While conceding that there are some good reasons for in cluding land under capital BdhmBawerk declines to do so for the reasons which we may enumerate as follows RECENT DISCUSSION OF THE CAPITAL CONCEPT 31 1 Land is immovable Capital is for the most part movable 2 Land is a gift of nature Capital is a result of labor 3 Land cannot be increased capital can be 4 The social and economical position of the landlord is essentially different from that of the capitalist 5 Property in land and property in movables are justi fied on essentially different grounds and they are com monly attacked by quite distinct people 6 Land is the special agent in a kind of production agriculture that is economically distinguished by many important peculiarities 7 The income from land differs in many ways from in come from capital 8 Using capital for all material means of acquisition leaves us no name for produced acquisitive instruments 9 Popular usage does not put land under capital but opposes the two 10 Usage does not apply the term  interest  to the in come from land He concludes that it is most convenient to keep land quite distinct from other kinds of productive wealth and that  there is a considerable balance in favor of defining capital as the  produced means of acquisition and against the inclusion of land t Of this formidable list it must be said that not a reason given considered singly is free from flaw some are quite mistaken and collectively they are not conclusive The worth of 1 is destroyed for purposes of definition by the limitation  for the most part It is not that a definition may not be based on a difference in degree where qualities grade off from one extreme to another and if something of importance depends on the degree it may often be expedient to draw a line of division more or less arbitrarily somewhere Here however it is not so Things like houses ditches trees that are as firmly fixed Positive Theory pp 55 56 t Ibid p 5632 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS as the soil itself and whose value would be quite lost if they were moved are without a question included in cap ital Turning to the other part of the statement that land is immovable it is found quite as untrue Parts of land are shifting from day to day It is usual for those who follow this definition to consider that a thing ceases to be land and becomes capital the instant it is moved by mans agency or effort but to appeal to this to prove the point is to confound  unmoved  with  immovable No matter is immovable To say that land means something that has not been moved by man begs the question and this is evidently an untenable definition of nature or material agents Some writers who have fol lowed out such reasoning have been led to narrow the essential concept of land down to mere situation or dif ferently expressed to the geometric relations in which any part of it stands to other parts f This is a very dif ferent idea from the one here defended by BohmBawerk and would not be consistent with some of the other reasons of this list Reason 1 in the list appears to be an illogical use of reason 2 it being falsely assumed that results of labor are necessarily movable in the relative sense in which we can use that term of material things and that gifts of nature are immovable No such parallelism exists and the two reasons are often in conflict Passing 2 and 3 for later and fuller consideration we take up 4 and 5 which appeal to social and personal grounds of distinction not to economic and impersonal ones Here is again a confusion of the political or legal question of ownership with the real economic question the function performed or contribution made by material agents This difference moreover in the social position of landlord and capitalist so emphasized can be shown to rest on accidental historical grounds which we cannot now discuss Again the emphasis of this difference is largely due to the misleading terminology which is under  Commons Distribution of Wealth p 29 t Marshall 2d ed p 198RECENT DISCUSSION OF THE CAPITAL CONCEPT 33 discussion And finally I would contest the statement that property in land and nmovables is justified on essentially different grounds They must be and are by most political theorists of today justified on exactly the same ground In 6 and 7 appeal is made to differences in economic nature In reason 6 there is again the fallacy of thinking of land as a field used for agriculture It must be said first that land in the sense of the word under discussion ie natural agents is an indispensable agent of the mill ing industry carpentry and every other art as well as of agriculture To call land the special agent of agri culture because that part of land which consists of fertile soil is necessary for plant life is to make a very crude distinction based on no logical principle At most a difference of degree only is involved in that a larger area is usually needed to produce a given value of food than is needed to produce that value of other things but the reverse is frequently true Secondly it may be said that  the important peculiarities  the chief of which no doubt is thought of as the law of diminishing returns here attributed to agriculture are in no way peculiar to it The belief that they are rests largely on the basis of a false terminology As to 7 likewise we have a begging of the question for the differences in our ways of regard ing interest and rent are primarily due to the terminology whose correctness is under discussion Finally it must be noted that when B6hmBawerk comes to explain interest from durable goods he refutes the statement that income from land differs in many ways from income from capital and  obeys many distinct laws of its own t He then finds that the two incomes have one common final cause I  Land rent is nothing but a special case of interest obtained from durable goods   Positive Theory pp 339357 f Ibid p 55 1 Ibid p 357  Ibid p 355 The explanation given by B6hmBawerk is open to serious criticism34 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS In 8 9 and 10 the appeal is to usage which is shifting and by no means uniform in the direction BihmBawerk assumes As to 8 the reply is that it will be an advantage not to designate by special names the group mentioned if it is shown as will be done later that such a group should not either for logical or practical purposes be marked off from the other parts of capital Indeed it is one of the most important advantages of a different terminology that it gets rid of the figment in question Reasons 9 and 10 contain doubtful statements Popular usage and economists even those who favor BMhmBawerks termi nology in many cases class land under capital speaking of the investment of capital in land and reckoning the land with the mans capital thereafter So when a loan is made in money we are always told that the thing really borrowed is what the money buys if machines then it is really these for which interest is paid if a farm then it is this for which interest is paid The moment you give the money aspect to the loan no attempt is made to distinguish between the income from land and the income from other material agents I have left to the last reasons 2 and 3 which stated to gether read that land is a gift of nature and cannot be increased while capital is a result of labor and can be increased This thought is the central one in the distinc tion it is the parent of all the other reasons and we here trace to their source the errors just considered The trail of the serpent the mark of the labor theory of value is over the whole treatment of capital as the product of former labor BMhmBawerk does not escape it He has indeed given a most able refutation of that theory and takes frequent opportunities to stamp it with his disap proval In his later volume he says that the phrase  stock of accumulated labor  is a metaphor and again  Capital and Interest passim but particularly pp 237387 t Positive Theory p 33RECENT DISCUSSION OF THE CAPITAL CONCEPT 35 that it is employing a mere  figure of speech  to speak of capital as  previous labor  or  storedup labor  In refuting socialist views he has shown that capital  is not exclusively  previous labor  f but he is not free from his own criticism when he adds but it is partly and in deed as a rule it is principally previous labor for the rest it is valuable natural power stored up for human pur poses t Later he again makes greater limitations on the proposition and says  The asserted  law that the value of goods is regulated by the amount of the labor incorporated in them does not hold at all in the case of a very considerable proportion of goods in the case of the others does not hold always and never holds exactly These are the facts of experience with which the value theorists have to reckon  In these statements we have the view that the value of capital is not in proportion to previous labor and that capital owes its value partly to scarce and valuable natural powers The same idea ap pears elsewhere Capital  to keep the same form of expression  is  storedup labor but it is something more it is also storedup valuable natural power II The part attributed to natural powers reaches at times the vanishingpoint as B6hmBawerk shows  but he does not draw the obvious inference that the part of labor reaches at times the vanishingpoint and that many products many things classed by him as capital are exclusively  storedup  natural powers Why continue to apply the phrase  products of labor  more than  products of nature  to those things which owe to labor proportions of their value varying from all to nothing Where there is no labor would BohmBawerk cease to call the thing capital Certainly not must be the answer if that is the only difference To take his own illustration used against Rodbertus for another purpose  If a lump of solid gold  Positive Theory p 53 t Capital and Interest p 341 X Ibid p 341  Ibid p 387 JPositive Theory p 99 TF Capital

we are criticizing it would not be capital but land being a gift of nature In truth BMhmBawerk does not concern himself about any such difficulties but speaks literally of capital in the very phrase he has called a metaphor He says  The next stage of the controversy brings us to the question whether we are to give the name of capital only to the products of labor that serve for acquisition the  previous storedup labor or are to include land t Again he ap proves the same usage when he says Mill has so far yielded to the pressure of facts as to admit that capital is itself the product of labor and that its instrumentality in production is therefore in reality that of labor in an indirect shape I It seems to BohmBawerk selfevident that capital is produced  Every child knows that a piece of capital say a hammer must be produced if it is to come into existence  Now there might be some un certainty taking the sentence alone as to just what is meant here by produced but the context shows that this means just what the lastquoted sentence does that capital is produced by labor In the discussion of the roundabout method of production he consciously omits 11 from the productive powers the uses of land for the sake of simplification and assumes that the annual endow ment of powers consists only of  labor years There is the danger in this omission that it may accustom the author aud his readers to the thought that capital indeed consists of storedup labor alone In fact most products are due to the use of both sources of production but sup posing he had omitted for the sake of simplification the labor years and had assumed that the productive powers of land alone produced all goods Such cases in  Capital and Interest p 338 t Positive Theory p 55 L Ibid p 98  Ibid p 117 il

occurred to BohmBawerk to speak of such goods as products if as is usually the case they were not fully fitted for consumption hence were intermediate goods I have looked in vain not only in his writings but through economic literature for an admission that capital may be a  product  of unassisted nature as fully as it can be the product of labor Yet there seems no valid reason why that view should not be held the only reason why it is not being that the labor theory of value still influences the thoughts and utter ances of men Our immediate study let us recall is the validity of a distinction between capital and land on the ground that the one is and the other is not the product of labor We have just seen the difficulty of applying it in the case of capital We must now note that BoThmBawerk gives up the attempt to apply it strictly to land He says that improvements on land so far as they are completely incorporated with it are to be kept separate from capi talfor the same reasons which made us keep land itself separate from capital t Evidently the author deceives himself He has forgotten one of the most important reasons for the distinction the one we are discussing namely that capital is the result of labor and land is not In this case he is classing the improvements with land not because but in spite of the fact that they are the results of labor He sees the difficulty and in a note says I may be accused of want of logic here on the ground that such improvements are always products which serve towards further production and therefore come under our definition of capital t But he argues  The criticism is correct as to the letter but wrong as to the spirit What can the spirit of the distinction be that is  The Italics are my own t Positive Theory p 65 X Ibid p 6538 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS so opposed to the words of the definition We get this answer A stay propped up against a tree is certainly not the tree itself but an outside body But who would still call it an outside body if after some years it had grown inseparable from the tree  So far as this has any application at all it disproves what the author wishes to support for we should not call a stick around which the tree had grown a part of the tree The tree has the unity of life and organization and the stay is no part of it The essential thing for us however is that here also is a set of cases in which B6hmBawerk finds it practi cally impossible to make the distinction between capital and land depend on whether their source is in labor Though the source of their value is in labor some things are to be classed with natural agents because they are physically inseparable from natural agents May we not ask why if the labor is incorporated in the land does not the land become capital  In some cases a touch of labor is all that is needed to  produce  goods of large value from natural materials which are then called capital Why call a combination of natural agents and labor land at one time and capital at another A satisfactory reason if there be one has never yet been given To sum up the objections to the attempt to make the distinction between land and capital rest on the absence or presence of labor 1 Some capital things treated as such by BohmBawerk and others is not the result of labor at all for example the meteoric lump of gold the annual crop of fruits on an untitled field the yield of a mineral spring 2 It is not logical to call capital a result or product of labor any more than to call it a result or product of land Nearly all capital owes in part its economic existence to labor but its value is not measured by the amount of labor whatever that may mean any more than it is Positive Theory p 65RECENT DISCUSSION OF THE CAPITAL CONCEI T 39 measured by the amount of uses of land In fact we have no way of expressing the amount of labor or of uses of land except through their value 3 If the mere presence of labor in producing the present values is what is meant by production then practically all land must be classed as capital for there is little of it that has not had its value enhanced by labor applied to it 4 The attempt to distinguish between the part of the value of a material thing that is due to labor and the part that is due to nature keeping thus nature or land and capital distinct is vain when once the labor has been spent This is recognized by BMhmBawerk in certain cases like permanent improvements on agricultural fields but this case differs in no essential from every other case where scarce natural materials are united with labor It is purely arbitrary to call some such combinations land and others capital 5 Finally it is not true that land as understood by the business man or the economist when he really comes to his problem consists only of the gifts of nature Large areas are made and reclaimed and then are treated pre cisely the same way as the land that exists little changed since coming from natures hand The reasons are so many and conclusive against this distinction that only the influence of the labor theory of value over those who think themselves emancipated from it can explain the persistence of the error Yet this dis tinction is of the essence of BohmBawerks concept of capital A consistent capital concept never can be based upon it40 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS VI A RESTATEMENT OF THE CAPITAL CONCEPT We have seen  that BMhmBawerk holds the view that capital should be taken to consist of concrete goods and that he opposes strongly any attempt to make some kind of abstraction the essence of capital t He does not think that capital should be spoken of as a  sum of value or as circulating power or as purchasing powerj He believes that capital consists of  the common material goods called mills looms ploughs locomotives It is these and not  an immaterial sum of value which  can grind corn or spin yarn or plough up land or carry a load  We have seen that the attack of Clark on the work of BMhmBawerk assumes that the concrete concep tion is the one that TihmBawerk makes use of and that it is a false one Our criticism of WihmBawerks treat ment is on a different line namely that he has not one but two concepts of capitals and that while defining capi tal as if it could be spoken of without reference to value or the use of value expressions he employs a value con cept almost entirely in his reasoning on the interest prob lem He makes a shift without being conscious of it and makes use of the concept which Clark criticises him for ignoring In the concept of capital must be united both the thought of concrete things and that of their value for their quantity is only measurable in a way that permits of comparison in terms of value There is nothing meta physical or abstract about this it is what business men are doing constantly They do not attempt to compare amounts of capital by physical standards of measurement Things which lose their value are no longer counted as See supra p 6 t Positive Theory pp 33 34  Ibid pp 58 59  See other definitions of capital as concrete in Positive Theory pp 22 65 and passim 11 One of which differs both from the social and the private capital three therefore including both of themRECENT DISCUSSION OF THE CAPITAL CONCEPT 41 capital no matter how large their amount A change in the quality involving a change in value or in value of a given quality is at once counted as a change in the quan tity of capital And the idea of capital is carried over to all things of value regardless of the question of the origin of the good B6hmBawerk illustrates this usage fre quently for example when he speaks of the  capital value of land  and again in making use of the word  capitalization in explaining the value of land and inter est arising from itt The business man followed by the economist when he comes to discuss practical problems starts with the thought of a man with a sum of money to spend for buy ing goods and this buying is called  investing  his capi tal or as the word originally meant  clothing the money in the form of other material things When the money is thus invested it may be in the form of machines buildings lands products on which labor has been em ployed If the investment has been fortunate we say comparing the values with the value of the money ex pended that the capital has increased Now there is of course some danger of confusing capital with money but no more than in every case where money is used to ex press the value of other goods What is the capital Either the money or the thing whose value is expressed in money Money is itself a concrete thing one in which the value of other things is expressed It is this expres sion and measurement of market value which is the es sence of the capital concept in much business usage as well as in most economic discussion no matter what may be the formal definition This must be recognized in our definition Capital in our conception is an aspect of material things or better it consists of material things considered in one aspect their market value It is under this aspect  Positive Theory p 344 t Ibid p

things in terms of dollars Things are thus capitalized A writer tracing the development of the wealth concept has well pointed out that at one time wealth was looked upon as consisting of things of use to the owner lands flocks herds usevalues to use the old phrase but that now it is looked upon as made up of things having exchange value estimated in terms of the general standard of value in the community He would confine the term 1 wealth  to this latter concept leaving the former without any special name while the proposal here is to confine the term wealth to the former con cept and apply to the latter the term  capital We thus adhere as closely as possible to popular usage We should thus speak of a mans wealth as consisting of a number of acres of land a herd of horses or cattle a number of ma chines or ships but we should say that his capital con sisted of so many thousand dollars worth of land cattle and the like We say that a company has a capital of so many thousand dollars and it is invested in buildings and machinery The distinction between nominal capital and paidup capital and that between the capital stock con sisting of paper certificates or shares and the capital of valuable material things present no serious difficulties Wealth and capital consist of precisely the same things Wealth is the popular expression for goods the exact valu ation of which is not stated Capital is merely the ordi nary market value expression of wealth As we cannot give to the value of anything an arithmetical expression except in terms of some other concrete thing we find it most convenient to express it in terms of money The increase or decrease of capital is not measured by any ulti mate standard The changes in its money expression do  Charles A Tuttle in Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science i 615 ffRECENT DISCUSSION OF THE CAPITAL CONCEPT 43 not necessarily reflect changes in the welfare of the com munity or of the individual Over periods of time changes in the quantity of capital can only be determined in a con ventional way by mens agreeing to accept one commodity or group of commodities as a standard But at any mo ment the different portions of capital are homogeneous and can be compared added or subtracted as we see men doing every day in business The term  property again is loosely used in place of wealth or capital but can be clearly distinguished from them as the legal not the economic aspect of valuable material things In short property has as its essence the idea of legal right and in connection with material things the important right is that of control Ownership is simply a greater or less degree of control The term property meaning legal rights of control is broader that is extends to more things than the terms  wealth  or capital for it includes patent rights legal monopolies valuable agreements from men to do or not to do certain things all having the common feature that the value is not attached to or connected with or attributed to a material thing but is due to the legal right to control or limit some persons action It seems inadvisable to try to make the content of wealth as large as that of property by considering that men become wealth to the degree that their rights are limited in the interest of others To illustrate the use of the terms  wealth  capital and  property we would say that a stock of goods is wealth it is or it represents a capital of 10000 and it is the property of Jones and the property is worth 10000 If Brown holds a mortgage of 5000 on the property how ever the lawyers may look at it we must consider that Joness property or right is only of the value of 5000 The property of Brown and that of Jones are both found within the capital of 10000 and in total value cannot  Such a view is taken by Irving Fisher Economic Journal vii 20644 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS exceed it The value of the property owned never can exceed the capital that is the object of the legal right Many absurdities in our laws of taxation have resulted from confusing the economic view of wealth with the legal question of ownership and of confusing still less excus ably the mere paper evidences of legal rights with the wealth to which those rights apply To restate the definition that has here been arrived at Capital is economic wealth whose quantity is expressed in a general value unit It is used as applying to a single thing or to a group of things There is no place in it for the distinction the inconsistencies of which have been discussed between individual and social capital We do not call the services of things that minister directly to satisfaction unproductive while calling the personal ser vices of men productive even where nothing material results We do not retain the distinction between con sumption and production goods as essential in economic discussion All valuable things of more than momentary duration are  intermediate goods are capital in that they are valuable because designed to satisfy future wants While the definition thus sweeps away any limitation on the content of capital because of a difference in future use it likewise sweeps away any limitation because of a difference in the origin or source of its value Capital is not thought of as made up only of goods whose value is the result of labor It has been shown that the pre vailing distinction between natural agents and pro duced agents of production involves radical defects of logic and is practically not maintained This definition is emancipated from the false labor theory of value In regard to the contending views first that capital consists of concrete goods and second that it is the value of goods the definition harmonizes them by defining capital as consisting of the concrete things but only when con sidered as homogeneous and comparable units of valueRECENT DISCUSSION OF TIE CAPITAL CONCEPT 45 I would not exaggerate the significance of the change here proposed in the capital concept yet it would be folly to ignore the consequences its acceptance would involve for economic theory Textbooks must be rewritten and many questions must be reexamined This is not because the concept is unused by the older writers but because they have used it without recognizing how different it was from their formal definitions and the concept employed in other parts of their work Many students of recent years have felt the need of a readjustment of the leading economic concepts This concept requires and makes possible such a readjustment The current theories of land value of rent of interest to a greater or less extent rest on the unsound ideas which have been criticized throughout this paper On another occasion the writer will attempt to state the outlines of an economic system of thought in harmony with the capital concept here presented FRANK A FETTER STANFORD UNIVERSITY

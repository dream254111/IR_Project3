J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1008703,THE GRANGE AND THE COOPERATIVE ENTERPRISES IN NEW ENGLAND,I242489,THE GRANGE AND THE COOPERATIVE ENTERPRISES IN NEW ENGLAND IN THIS AGE OF ORGANIZATION THERE IS SCARCELY A BRANCH OF INDUSTRY NOT ORGANIZED IN SOME WAY FOR THE PROMOTION OF ITS INTERESTS THE FIRST STRONG ORGANIZATION WHICH SOUGHT TO COMBINE THE FARMERS FOR COMMON PROTECTION ENCOURAGEMENT AND ENLIGHTENMENT WAS THE NATIONAL GRANGE OF THE PATRONS OF HUSBANDRY FOUNDED IN WASHING TON D C DEC 4 1867 A NATIONAL GRANGE WITH CONSTITUTION AND RITUAL WAS ESTABLISHED THEN SUBORDINATE GRANGES FIFTEEN SUBORDI NATE GRANGES MIGHT THEMSELVES ORGANIZE A STATE GRANGE ALL WERE OBLIGATED TO STRICT OBEDIENCE AND FEALTY TO THE NATIONAL GRANGE IN SPITE OF SOME OPPOSITION TO IT IN THIS MONARCHIAL FEATURE OF THE ORGANIZATION PROBABLY LIES THE SECRET OF THE SUCCESS WHICH HAS TIDED THE ORDER OVER MANY DIFFICULTIES THE GRANGE OWES ITS ORIGIN TO MR O H KELLEY A  PLAIN PRACTICAL FARMER A CLERK IN THE AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT AT WASHINGTON AFTER THE WAR PRESIDENT JOHNSON SELECTED MR KELLEY TO INVESTIGATE THE CONDITIONS AND NEEDS OF THE FARMERS IN THE SOUTH HE RETURNED FULL OF THE IDEA THAT IN ORDER TO BETTER THEIR CONDITION ORGANIZATION MUST BE EFFECTED ON CONSULTATION WITH FRIENDS INTERESTED IN THE FAR MERS WELFARE THE NATIONAL GRANGE OF PATRONS OF HUSBANDRY WAS CONCEIVED BY MR KELLEY AND SIX ASSOCIATES WOMEN WERE ADMITTED TO AN EQUALITY IN MEMBERSHIP THUS ADDING THAT DISTINCTIVE FEATURE WITHOUT WHICH IT IS CLAIMED THE GRANGE WOULD NOT BE IN EXISTENCE TODAY THE DECLARATION OF PURPOSES IS A BROAD AND WORTHY ONE ASPIRING TO PROMOTE ALL THAT IS BEST IN THE MENTAL MORAL SOCIAL AND SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS TO ADVANCE THE MATERIAL INTERESTS OF THE PATRONS AND MORE BROADLY TO INCREASE THE WELFARE OF ALL SOCIETY ANY 798THE GRANGE IN NEW ENGLAND 103 GRANGE IF TRUE TO ITS OBLIGATIONS CANNOT BE PARTISAN IN POLITICS RELIG ION OR IN ANY SUBJECT INVOLVING NATURAL DIFFERENCES OF OPINION IN 1868 MR KELLEY GAVE UP HIS GOVERNMENT POSITION AND STARTED FOR MINNESOTA HIS HOME ORGANIZING GRANGES AS HE WENT IN 1873 THE FIRST GREAT MEETING OF THE NATIONAL GRANGE WAS HELD IN GEORGETOWN D C AT WHICH ELEVEN STATES WERE REPRESENTED THIS MEETING PRAC TICALLY MARKS THE EPOCH OF ITS PERMANENT ORGANIZATION UNTIL THEN THE AFFAIRS WERE ENTIRELY IN THE HANDS OF THE FOUNDERS THE YEARS 1872 TO 1875 MARK A PERIOD OF PHENOMENAL GROWTH IN 1873 ALONE 13OOO SUBORDINATE GRANGES WERE ORGANIZEDT POLITICIANS TRIED TO USE IT WILD BUSINESS SCHEMES WERE ENGAGED IN IN SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY THOUSANDS BECAME MEMBERS WHO HAD NO INTERESTS IN FARMING THE REASON FOR THIS EXTRAORDINARY GROWTH IS FOUND LARGELY IN THE DISCONTENTS ARISING FROM THE CAUSES WHICH RESULTED IN THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 1873 AND FROM THE INDUSTRIAL DEPRESSION FOLLOWING THE INFLA TION OF THE CURRENCY AND THE INCREASE IN CREDIT THROUGH EACH VENTURE WERE INSTRUMENTS IN BUILDING UP GIGANTIC SPECULATIVE OPERATIONS WHICH FINALLY RESULTED IN A CRASH DURING THE APPARENT PROSPERITY OF TRADE MEN WERE ATTRACTED FROM AGRICULTURE TO TRADE FARM LAND DECLINED WHILE CITY REAL ESTATE ROSE SPECULATION AND CORNERS IN STAPLE FARM PRODUCTS CAUSED GREAT FLUCTUATIONS IN PRICES WHILE THE PRICES OF FARMERS NECESSARIES ROSE A FURTHER AND IMPORTANT REASON IS FOUND IN THE DISAFFECTIONS CAUSED BY THE REAL AND ALLEGED EXTORTION OF THE RAILROADS IN THE WEST AND SOUTH THE PRESSURE FROM THIS CAUSE WAS NATURALLY GREATEST SINCE FROM THESE THE GREAT SHIPMENTS OF GRAIN ARE MADE AND THERE THE GROWTH WAS LARGEST IN 1875 THE ORDER NUMBERED ABOUT 1500000 IN EVERY SECTION OF THE COUNTRY THE GRANGE NOW IN THE HANDS OF THE FARMERS THUS EXCITED OVER THEIR REAL AND ALLEGED WRONGS WAS IN DANGER OF BEING PERVERTED FROM ITS ORIGINAL EDUCATIONAL AND SOCIAL AIMS JUST AT THIS TIME OCCURRED THE FAMOUS  GRANGER  RAILROAD LEGISLATION WHICH AROUSED SUCH INTEREST THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IT WAS ESSEN TIALLY A FARMERS MOVEMENT BUT THE GRANGE AS A BODY IS NOT TO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE SINCE THE GRANGE WAS THEN IN THE ZENITH OF POPU LARITY ALL ACTS COMING FROM THE FARMERS WERE BRANDED AS GRANGER WITHOUT DISCRIMINATION HOWEVER THE GRANGE DOES NOT DISCLAIM AN INFLUENCE IN THE MATTER  SEE SECTION 5 OF THE  DECLARATION OF PURPOSES  T N J BUREAU OF STATISTICS NINTH ANNUAL REPORT P 336 1 MR C W PREISEN SAYS IN SPITE OF THE ASSERTIONS OF MR C F ADAMS AND OTHERS IT CAN BE SHOWN THAT THE GRANGE WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ILLINOIS LEGISLA TION WHEN THE CONSTITUTION OF 1870 AND THE LAW OF 1871 WERE PASSED THE GRANGE 7991104 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY VAST BUSINESS ENTERPRISES WERE ENGAGED IN BUT ENTERPRISES IN THE HANDS OF UNSKILLED AND OFTEN UNSCRUPULOUS HANDS FAILED THE FINAN CIAL BENEFITS LOST THOSE WHO HAD ENTERED FOR PURELY SELFISH MOTIVES RAPIDLY WITHDREW AND THE ORDER ASSUMED NOMINAL PROPORTIONS MR PREISEN 1838 SAYS  THE GRANGE STILL LIVES BUT ITS GLORY IS DEPARTED YET IT SEEMS THAT THE PART THAT WILL GIVE THE TRUER GLORY STILL REMAINS TO TEACH THE FARMER TO BE MORE SCIENTIFIC AND BUSINESSLIKE IN HIS METHODS OF WORK MORE ALIVE TO HIS OWN BEST INTERESTS AND THOSE OF THE COM MUNITY THE TRUE PROMINENCE OF THE EDUCATIONAL FEATURES AS CONCEIVED AND REITERATED BY THE GRANGERS THEMSELVES IS EMPHASIZED BY THE MASTER OF THE NEW YORK STATE GRANGE ISGI THESE FINANCIAL GAINS OR SAVINGS ARE MORE THAN GRATIFYING TO OUR MEMBERS YET THEY PALE INTO INSIGNIFICANCE IN COMPARISON WITH THE EDUCATIONAL BENEFITS OF OUR BE LOVED ORDER  WE HOLD THAT EDUCATION SHOULD EVER BE ACCORDED THE MOST PROMINENT PLACE IN OUR GRANGE DELIBERATIONS AND THAT NO PAINS SHOULD BE SPARED BY OUR GRANGE EDUCATORS TO IMPRESS THIS TRUTH THAT THE SUCCESS AND PERPETUITY OF OUR ORDER MUST AND WILL DEPEND UPON THE INTELLIGENCE OF ITS MEMBERSHIP T PERHAPS NO BETTER IDEA OF THE WORK THE GRANGE HAS ACCOMPLISHED AND CLAIMS TO HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN ACCOMPLISHING CAN BE GAINED THAN FROM THE PROCLAMATION ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL GRANGE ON THE OCCA SION OF ITS TWENTYFIFTH ANNIVERSARY 1891 AFTER MENTIONING ITS WORK IN ORGANIZATION INFLUENCE IN BROADENING THE SPHERE OF WOMAN AND THE INFLUENCE UPON THE HOME

ORGANIZATION AT PRESENT IS INTERESTED IN AGITATING ARE PASSAGE OF MEASURES TO PREVENT ADULTERATION OF FOOD PASSAGE OF THE WASHBURNHATCH BILL FREE DELIVERY OF MAIL TO RURAL POPULATION NONIRRIGATION OF THE ARID LANDS OF THE WEST BY THE GOVERNMENT ON THE GROUND THAT THE LANDS ARE NOT YET NEEDED THE SECURING OF LAWS TO REMEDY UNEQUAL TAXATION PROMOTION OF INTEREST IN AGRICULTURAL COLLEGES ACTION FOR BETTER ROADS ETCT NATURALLY THE GRANGE FIRST DECLINED AS A POWER IN THE WEST AND SOUTH WHERE ITS GROWTH HAD BEEN MOST PHENOMENAL DURING ITS DECADENCE OTHER ASSOCIATIONS OF FARMERS WITH SIMILAR PURPOSES THOUGH AVOWEDLY WITH MORE POLITICAL AIMS AROSE CHIEFLY THE FARMERS ALLIANCE BUT ITS STRONGEST FOOTHOLD SEEMS TO BE TAKEN IN NEW ENG LAND AND THE MIDDLE STATES WHERE THE EDUCATIONAL AND SOCIAL FEATURES ARE MOST EMPHASIZED IN NEW ENGLAND AT THE PRESENT TIME THE ORDER IS STEADILY GROWING IN 1886 IT NUMBERED THERE BETWEEN 25000 AND 30OOO000 RHODE ISLAND WAS NOT THEN REPRESENTED IN 1892 THE MEM BERSHIP WAS ABOUT 50000 11 AS HAS BEEN STATED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GRANGE IN NEW ENGLAND HAS COME SINCE THE PERIOD WHEN FINANCIAL INTERESTS WERE THE PRIME INDUCEMENTS FOR ORGANIZATION HENCE ITS DISTINCTIVE FEATURES HAVE REMAINED EDUCATIONAL AND SOCIAL AT THE PRESENT TIME HOWEVER INTEREST IN COOPERATIVE ENTERPRISES SEEMS QUITE STRONG A COMMITTEE REPORTING TO ONE OF THE NEW HAMPSHIRE STATE

PAPERS OF AMERICAN ECO NOMIC ASSOCIATION VOL I P 353 S C W PREISEN  OUTCOME OF THE GRANGER MOVEMENT POPULAR SCIENCE MONTHLY VOL XXXII P 20O I COMPILED FROM REPORT OF NATIONAL GRANGES AND REPORTS OF THE STATE GRANGES SOIIO6 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY FEELING THUS  IN THESE DAYS OF LOW PRICES AND PUSHING UNSCRUPULOUS COMPETITION WE FIND THE MIND OF THE FARMER OPENING TO THE IDEA OF COOPERATION WITH A DEGREE OF RECEPTIVITY AND APPRECIATION NEVER BEFORE OBSERVABLE IN MEN OF HIS CALLING AGAIN AND AGAIN IN LOOKING THROUGH THE REPORTS OF THE VARIOUS GRANGES WE FIND THE OPINION THAT  THOSE GRANGES THAT ARE THE MOST ACTIVE IN COOPERATIVE BUSINESS ARE THE STRONGEST IN EVERY POINT THE REASON FOR THIS IS NOT DIFFICULT TO SEE FOR THE SPIRIT PUSH  AND BUSI NESS ABILITY WHICH WOULD MAKE MEN SUCCESSFUL IN THESE ENTERPRISES MUST NEEDS MAKE THEM ACTIVE IN THE WIDER WORK OF THE GRANGE PERHAPS NO CLASS IS MORE AT THE MERCY OF THE MIDDLEMAN THAN THE FARMER THE PRICES OF THOSE THINGS WHICH HE BUYS ARE LARGELY CON TROLLED BY CUSTOM UNLESS HE LIVE NEAR SOME LARGE BUSINESS CENTRE AND THE MAJORITY DO NOT WHILE THE PRICES OF WHAT HE SELLS HIS GRAIN CATTLE SHEEP WOOL FRUIT ETC ARE SOLD AT THE COMPETITIVE PRICES OF A WORLD MARKET HIS DISTANCE FROM TRADES CENTRES WHERE COMPETITION KEEPS PRICES NEAR THE MINIMUM IS A REASON THEN WHY HE DESIRES ESPECIALLY THE BENEFITS OF CONSUMPTIVE COOPERATION YET THE VERY FACT OF THE FARMERS ISOLATION IS ONE OF THE CHIEF OBSTACLES TO COOPERATIVE ENTER PRISES AMONG THEM ANOTHER HINDRANCE TO THE COOPERATIVE SPIRIT IS THE EXTREME INDIVIDUALISM IN THE FARMERS CHARACTER FOUND PARTICULARLY IN NEW ENGLAND AS WRITERS UPON NEW ENGLAND CHARACTER NEVER TIRE OF REITERATING UPON THESE CONDITIONS THE GRANGE HAS POWER TO EXERT A CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE FIRST IT OVERCOMES IN A MEASURE THE FAR MERS ISOLATION BY MAKING HIM A UNIT IN THE ONE CENTRAL ORGANIZATION AND FURTHER BY DISCUSSING COMMON INTERESTS AND PLANS FOR COMMON IMPROVEMENT WITH HIS NEIGHBORS HIS SYMPATHIES ARE BROADENED AND HIS INTERESTS BECOME LESS SELFCENTRED WHILE THESE INFLUENCES ONLY PARTIALLY REMOVE THE HINDRANCES DUE TO SITUATION AND CHARACTER PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES ARE ALSO TO BE MET IN THE DIRECT OPERATION OF THE SCHEMES SUPPOSE FIRST THE COOPERATIVE STORE TO BE CONDUCTED ON THE PLAN OF GENERAL COUNTRY STORES BUYING A FARMERS SMALL PRODUCTS AS WELL AS RETAILING TO HIM NECESSARIES EVEN THEN THERE WILL BE THE TEMPTATION TO TRADE ELSEWHERE IF BUSINESS OR OTHER INTERESTS TAKES THE FARMER TO ANOTHER PLACEAND OFTEN THE ADVANTAGE GAINED BY BUYING OR SELLING AT A COOPERATIVE STORE CANNOT COMPENSATE FOR TIME AND INCONVENIENCE INVOLVED IN MAKING EXTRA TRIPS WHEN THE TRADING MAY BE DONE IN CON NECTION WITH OTHER BUSINESS IF THE STORE RETAIL GOODS ONLY THE OBJEC TIONS BECOME MORE WEIGHTY SINCE THE AVERAGE FARMER DEPENDS LARGELY UPON THE EXCHANGE OF HIS BUTTER CHEESE EGGS ETC FOR HIS NECESSARY GROCERIES WHILE HIS CASH IS USED IN PURCHASING CLOTHES FURNISHINGS IMPLEMENTS AND THE LIKE HENCE IT MAY BE FAR MORE TO HIS ADVANTAGE 802THE GRANGE IN NEW ENGLAND IO7 TO BUY WHERE HE CAN SELL HIS SMALL PRODUCTS EVEN THOUGH HE GET A DISCOUNT AT A COOPERATIVE STORE WHERE THE GRANGE EMPLOYS A PUR CHASING AGENT THE SAME OBJECTIONS HOLD AS WITH THE RETAIL STORE EXCEPT THAT INCONVENIENCES ARE APT TO BE MORE ACCENTUATED AND LESS PROVISION FOR A LATITUDE OF TASTES IS POSSIBLE IF STRONG COOPERATIVE STORES UNDER GOOD MANAGEMENT AND CONDUCTED ON STRICTLY BUSINESS PRINCIPLES WERE INSTITUTED IN THE BEGINNING THIS PHASE OF COOPERATION MIGHT SEEM MORE HOPEFUL BUT IN FARMING COM MUNITIES IT SEEMS THAT IT CAN BE LITTLE HOPED THAT PRESENT SELFINTEREST WILL BE SUFFICIENTLY SACRIFICED TO SURMOUNT THE DIFFICULTIES IN SMALL ENTER PRISES OR THAT CAPITAL AND SUPPORT WILL BE GIVEN TO LARGE ENTERPRISES AT ONCE COOPERATION AMONG THE NEW ENGLAND GRANGES HAS BEEN CONFINED ALMOST ENTIRELY TO THE BUYING OF COMMODITIES AND TO FIRE INSURANCE THE SUBJECT OF COOPERATIVE MARKETING IS BEING DISCUSSED WITH SOME CONFIDENCE PARTICULARLY THE MARKETING OF STAPLE PRODUCTS ONE YEAR AT LEAST THE NEW HAMPSHIRE STATE GRANGE EMPLOYED AN AGENT TO SHIP THE APPLES OF PATRONS TO ENGLAND BUT WITHOUT GREAT SUCCESS SINCE THE PATRONS WERE TOO FEARFUL OF TTIE VENTURE THE METHOD OF COOPERATIVE BUYING MOST PREVALENT IN NEW ENGLAND IS THAT BY TRADE DISCOUNTS OR TRADE LISTS THE STATE GRANGES MAKE ARRANGEMENTS WITH CERTAIN LARGE MANUFACTURERS AND WHOLESALE FIRMS FOR DISCOUNTS ON CASH PAYMENTS EACH SUBORDINATE GRANGE CHOOSES A PUR CHASING AGENT WHO RECEIVES THE LISTS AND MAKES THE PURCHASES THE AGENTS AND MEMBERS RECEIVING THE DISCOUNT ARE BOUND TO KEEP THE DIS COUNTS SECRET ANOTHER ANALOGOUS METHOD IS TO FURNISH MEMBERS WITH  TRADE CARDS ON PRESENTATION OF WHICH TO THE FIRMS UNDER CONTRACT WITH THE STATE GRANGE DISCOUNTS ARE ALLOWED THIS METHOD IS EM PLOYED LARGELY IN VERMONT RHODE ISLAND AND CONNECTICUT WHILE MASS ACHUSETTS HAS MERE PURCHASING AGENTS AND MAINE HAS ITS GRANGE STORE THE RESULTS OF THESE ENTERPRISES AS REPORTED TO THE SEVERAL STATE GRANGES IS AS FOLLOWS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE BUT LITTLE HAS YET BEEN DONE THOUGH CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IS MANIFESTED IN 1891 THE RICHDALE SYSTEM WAS URGED UPON THE ATTENTION OF THE GRANGES AS COMBINING THE BUYING AND MARKETING FEATURES AND AS A SYSTEM TOWARD WHICH IT WAS ADVISABLE TO WORK ADOPTING TRADE CARDS IN THE MEANTIME VERMONT REPORTS ONLY A BEGINNING IN COOPERATIVE BUYING WITH A FAIR DEGREE OF INTEREST OF THE SUCCESS AND EXTENT OF ENTERPRISES IN RHODE ISLAND WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO OBTAIN ANY DEFINITE KNOWLEDGE PROBABLY LITTLE IS DONE AS THE GRANGE HAS NOT BEEN LONG INSTITUTED THERE TRADE CARDS ARE USED TO SOME EXTENT HOWEVER 803IO8 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY IN MASSACHUSETTS THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE STATE GRANGE REPORTS AS FOLLOWS IN 1891  COOPERATIONTHE TRADE PROBLEMIS AS YET UNSOLVED AND WE HAVE THOUGHT THE MATTER OVER CAREFULLY AND WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT EACH SUBORDINATE GRANGE PLACE MORE CON FIDENCE IN THEIR PURCHASING AGENT OF NINETYFOUR GRANGES REPORTING TO THE STATE GRANGE IN 1891 SIX ONLY REPORT COOPERATIVE BUYING IN 1892 SEVEN OUT OF NINETYEIGHT REPORT SOME COOPERATIVE BUYING ONLY TWO OF THE SEVEN GRANGES ARE IDENTICAL WITH THOSE REPORTING IN 1891 OF THESE MANHAN GRANGE IN 1891 REPORTS A BUYING TO THE AMOUNT OF 3OOO WITH A MEMBERSHIP OF 102 IN 1892 WITH A MEMBER SHIP OF IIO IT REPORTS A BUSINESS AMOUNTING TO 2500OO DUDLEY GRANGE WITH 125 REPORTS BUSINESS TO AMOUNT OF 4654 IN 1891 BUT MAKES NO REPORT IN 1892 AT WESTPORT THE GRANGE COOPERATIVE UNION STORE SOLD ABOUT 7000 WORTH OF GOODS IN 1891 AND PATRONS RECEIVED FOUR PER CENT REBATE ON THE AMOUNT OF THEIR TRADE THE GRANGE NUMBERS NINETYTWO MEMBERS SUCH ISOLATED FACTS CAN ONLY BE USED AS BROAD INDICATIONS THEY SEEM TO JUSTIFY THE CONCLUSIONS THAT COOPERATION IS NOT A STRONG POWER IN THESE GRANGES OR WE SHOULD HEAR MORE OF IT IN THEIR REPORTS THEY WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE ALSO THAT THE ENTERPRISES WERE NOT OF A VERY LONG STANDING IN CONNECTICUT THE RESULTS ARE REPORTED AS NOT VERY ENCOURAGING IN 1891 THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE COMPLAINED THAT PATRONS GAVE AWAY PRICES AND DISCOUNTS AND LOANED THEIR TRADE CARDS T IN 1892 THE SAME COMMITTEE REPORTS THAT REPLIES TO CIRCULARS SENT OUT TO GRANGES AND TRADING HOUSES AS TO THE SATISFACTORINESS OF BUSINESS RELATIONS HAVE BEEN RATHER DISHEARTENING  WE FIND IN THESE RELATIONS TOO LITTLE HARMONY AND COOPERATION EXISTING BETWEEN PATRONS AND THOSE PARTIES WITH WHOM WE HAVE NEGOTIATED FOR MUTUAL BENEFIT AN ATTEMPT HAS BEEN MADE TO ORGANIZE GRANGE STORES BUT INTEREST WAS SLIGHT AND NO MONEY WAS PLEDGED THE COMMITTEE ADVOCATED A STOCK COMPANY OF SMALL SHARES MAINE FURNISHES NO DEFINITE REPORTS AND WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT COOPERATIVE ENTERPRISES HAVE LITTLE VITALITY THERE THE STATE GRANGE HAS A STORE AT PORTLAND WHICH IS SAID TO HAVE NEVER FAILED TO PAY SIX PER CENT INTEREST ON THE STOCK THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE FOR 1891 STATE THAT THE VOLUME OF TRADE HAS BEEN INCREASING STEADILY AND THE WORKING CAPITAL IS TURNED OVER ABOUT SIX TIMES IN A YEART IT MERITS  MASSACHUSETTS STATE GRANGE JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 1892 REPORT OF MASTER OF WESTPORT GRANGE T CONNECTICUT STATE GRANGE

IS LACK OF SUFFICIENT CAPITAL TO ENABLE THE MANAGERS TO BUY LARGE QUANTITIES AT THE BEST ADVANTAGE SHOWING THAT PATRONS DO NOT GIVE THE SUPPORT THEIR INTERESTS DEMAND THE STRONGEST COOPERATIVE

NEW HAMPSHIRE COMPANY IS THE STRONGEST IN 1892 IT HAD 16OO POLICIES COVERING INSURANCE TO THE AMOUNT OF 2200000 AS AGAINST 1399 POLICIES IN 1891 COVERING RISKS AMOUNTING TO 187267717 NO ASSESSMENTS HAVE BEEN NEC ESSARY THE RATE OF INSURANCE IS ONEHALF OF ONE PER CENT FOR THREE YEARS LESS THAN ONEHALF THE ORDINARY RATES IT IS TO BE NOTED THAT FEW ATTEMPTS AT COOPERATION OF LONG STANDING HAVE BEEN FOUND THE MAINE STATE GRANGE STORE HAS BEEN IN OPERA TION LONGEST ABOUT SIXTEEN YEARS IT IS ALSO TO BE NOTED THAT THE ENTERPRISES THUS FAR ATTEMPTED HAVE BEEN IN THE MAIN OF THE SIMPLEST CHARACTER THE DIFFICULT PROBLEMS IN COOPERATION HAVE SCARCELY BEEN TOUCHED THE FINANCIAL GAINS ALL TOLD CANNOT BE VERY CONSIDERABLE BUT THESE ATTEMPTS ARE CERTAINLY OF IMPORTANT EDUCATIONAL CHARACTER AS THEY STIMULATE INTEREST IN THE QUESTIONS BEFORE THE PEOPLE AND TEACH THE FARMERS BY PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE THE DIFFICULTIES ATTENDING THE APPLI CATION OF SOME OF THE PANACEAS FOR THE WORKINGMANS WOES

scriptive of the Gold Belt concluding with a generalized section of the formations of the Gold Belt 4 pages of text descriptive of the Jackson tract signed by H W Turner geologist and G F Becker geologist in charge a topographic map of the Jackson tract scale 1125000 a sheet showing the areal geology and a third of structure sec tions The area covered by the folio embraces a portion of the foot hills of the Sierra Nevada chiefly in the counties of Amador and Cal averas California The area is drained by the Mokelumne and Calaveras rivers The region is one of great economic importance and comprises a portion of the rich belt of goldquartz mines known as the Mother Lode One of these mines the Utica at An gels Camp is said to be paying about one million dollars yearly at the present time There are two distinct series of formations represented in this area The Calaveras and Mariposa formations of sedimentary origin and the associated igneous rocks form an older highly disturbed series on which a later series rests with a marked un conformity This later series represents the Tertiary and Pleistocene periods The Calaveras formation of Carboniferous age is composed of slates quartzite mica schists and limestone lenses and contains frequent goldquartz veins The Mariposa formation of Jurassic age is largely made up of clay slate There are two main belts of this formation and in the eastern one occur many of the goldquartz mines of the Mother Lode The igneous rocks associated with the Calaveras and Mariposa formations are of considerable variety but only three form areas of great extent These are serpentine granite and the porphyrites old andesites 787 and their tuffs The serpentine is undoubt edly an altered form of basic igneous rocks pyroxenite and peridotite and is intrusive The granite is likewise intrusive cutting through all the older rocks except the Mariposa formation and there is little doubt that it is later than this formation also and in adjoining districts it invades the Mari posa slates as well The porphyrites are largely altered forms of surface lavas and tuffs resembling andesite and in part be salt and these rocks have been folded and compressed along with the sediments of the Calaveras and Mariposa formations The areas called amphibolite schists on the geo logical map are chiefly metamorphic forms of these porphyrite tuffs The formation of the later series rest ing on these older rocks that deserves most attention is called the Auriferous gravel formation These gravels which are found chiefly on the ridge tops were deposited in Neocene time by rivers These old streams as may be seen by inspecting the map united into one trunk a little to the north of the Bear Mountains and there found an outlet into the gulf that then filled the San Joaquin Valley At many localities these old river gravels have been profitably mined for gold Forming a capping to the gravels are usually beds of volcanic ma terial chiefly andesite and rhyolite The Calaveras formation is of economie importance as containing frequent gold quartz veins and lenses of limestone Most of the latter are noted on the geological map The Mariposa formation affords a good roofing slate but is chiefly remarkable as containing in Amador county and in the north portion of Calaveras county the quartz veins of the Mother Lode The amphiboliteschist belts contain cop per deposits and goldquartz veins In the southern part of Calaveras county at An gels Camp the Mother Lode lies to the DcOExmBEx 13 1895788 SCIENCE east of the Mariposa slates and intersects a belt of amphibolite schist In the granite of the West Point are a are numerous goldquartz veins the ores of which contain a larger per cent of sul phurets than the ores of the Mother Lode mines and such ores are called base The serpentine areas contain chromeiron deposits at numerous points The tuffs overlying the gravels at Mokel umne Hill Valley Springs and other points have been found to make good building stone Sandstone quarries are marked in the foot hills in beds of Tertiary age and the deposits of the same age near lone afford large quantities of clay for pottery and of coal FOLIO 12 ESTILLVILLE KENTUCKYVIRGINIA TENNESSEE 1894 This folio consists of 5 pages of text by M R Campbell geologist a topographic map of the district scale 1125000 a sheet showing the areal geology another showing the economic geology a third of structure sections and a fourth giving a columnar sec tion north of Clinch River and another south of that river The territory represented by the folio is located principally in southwestern Vir ginia though the southern portion extends into Tennessee and the northwestern por tion into Kentucky Its area is 957 square miles fourfifths of which is in the Appa lachian Valley and onefifth in the Cumber land coal basin The surface features are quite varied In the Appalachian Valley they consist of a succession of narrow ridges separated by equally narrow valleys trending in a north east and southwest direction In the coal basin the ridges are less regular but higher reaching in two cases an elevation of over 4150 feet above the sea level The region is almost entirely within the drainage basin of the Tennessee River The N S VOL II No 50 principal tributaries of this stream are Holston Clinch and Powell rivers each of which is a stream of considerable impor tance The Kentucky portion of the terri tory is drained by the headwaters of the Cumberland River The geologic structure of the region is complicated In the Appalachian Valley the rocks have been squeezed in a northwest and southeast direction until they have been forced into great folds These are gen erally overturned toward the northwest and have in many cases been compressed to such an extent that they have broken allow ing one limb of the fold to be thrust over the other These faults are of frequent oc currence in this region Sixteen or seven teen can be counted on the geologic map In the coal basin the folding is less severe and the result is a broad basin in which dips are prevailingly light and in many places the rocks are horizontal The intense folding of the strata has brought to the surface all of the geologic formations from the Carboniferous to the Cambrian On lithologic grounds these are divided into twentytwo separate and dis tinct formations As a result of the original folding and subsequent erosion these for mations show at the surface in long narrow outcrops of limestone shale or sandstone which in the various folds are repeated over and over again It is this repetition of the hard beds that gives rise to the numerous ridges which are such conspicuous features of Appalachian topography In the coal basin the rocks are nearly horizontal and hence they show in outcrop around the flanks of the mountains or irregularly over the less rugged portions The mineral resources of this region are important though at present but slightly developed A belt of marble varying con siderably in composition and appearance outcrops along the northern side of Clinch Mountain Iron ore occurs in many partsDECEMBER 13 1895 SCIENCE

folio consists of 4 pages of text signed by N H Darton geologist and closing with a columnar section of the area a topo graphic map scale 1125000 a sheet show ing the areal geology of the district another showing the economic geology and a third exhibiting structure sections The area represented is about 1000 square miles of central Appalachian Vir ginia It comprises central and western Augusta county and portions of several ad jacent counties Staunton lies near the center of the eastern margin of the tract About a third of the area is in the Great Valley of Virginia and the remainder stretches halfway across to the Alleghany Mountains The geologic formations comprise mem bers from the Shenandoah limestone of the Great Valley to the Pocono sandstone of Lower Carboniferous age There are also some small dikes of diabase in the north western corner of the area The region is one in which relatively gentle folds pre dominate There is an overthurst fault which extends along the western side of the Great Valley for some distance and several other faults traverse the Shenan doah limestone The geological classification does not dif fer materially from that outlined by W B Rogers but geographic names have been applied to the formations The name Shen andoah limestone has been selected for the great series of limestones of the valley This series comprises several subdivisions but in the Staunton region they merge so gradually that no attempt has been made to differentiate them on the map The up per member contains a Trenton fauna and it is thought that the basal beds of the se NS VOL II No 5G ries extends into the Cambrian althoughno fossils have been discovered in them Next there is the representative of the Utica and Hudson shales which has been designated the Martinsburg shale It is overlain by the Massanutten sandstones which comprise the Oneida and Medina in terms of the New York series Next there are the Rockwood formation and the Lewistown limestone which include the formations be tween the Clinton and Lower Helderberg The Oriskany and associated sediments are here represented by a stratigraphic unit to which the name Monterey sandstone has been given The great series of Devonian strata lying above the Monterey has been divided into the Romney shale Jennings formation and Hampshire formation As they are not sharply separated from each other the patterns by which they are repre sented on the map are merged over a nar row zone along their boundaries Only a portion of the Pocono formation is included in the stratigraphic column in this region The principal economic resources are iron ores which lie on a local unconformity be tween the Monterey sandstone and the Rom ney shale and limestone for flux Some of the limestones are suitable for marbles and at many points lime is burned for local use There are several thin irregular beds of coal in the Pocono sandstone but they are not of economic importance Brick and pottery clays in the Great Valley complete the list of economic resources FOLIO 15 LASSEN PEAK CALIFORNIA 1895 This folio consists of 2 pages of text by J S Diller geologist descriptive of the Lassen Peak district supplemented by two pages with illustrations 9 figures devoted to recent volcanic activity a topographic map of the district a sheet showing the areal geology and another showing the economic geology The Lassen Peak district is situated inDEcECEMER 13 1895 SCIE northern California between the Sacra mento Valley and the Great Basin and ad joins the northern end of the Sierra Nevada It is bounded by the 121st and 122d merid ians and the 40th and 41st parallels and contains an area of 36344 square miles Within the district there are three dis tinct topographic features Beginning at the west it includes 1 a small portion of the eastern border of the Sacramento Val ley 2 the Lassen Peak volcanic ridge and 3 upon the east a portion of the Great Basin platform Twentytwo geological formations are shown upon the map Thirteen of these were deposited by water as sedimentary rocks The remaining nine are of igneous origin and were erupted from the interior of the earth in a molten condition Some of the sedimentary rocks especially the younger ones have not been materially changed since they were deposited but others such as the Auriferous slates have been greatly altered or metamorphosed and contain veins of quartz and metallif erous deposits By far the most abundant rocks of the Lassen Peak district are those of igneous origin The numerous volcanoes of the district have furnished a great variety of such rocks Beds of unaltered stratified rocks none of which are older than the Cretaceous are still nearly horizontal although uplifted they have not been compressed enough to produce folds On the other hand the Auriferous slates have been thrown into a series of anticlines and synclines and so greatly compressed as not only to close the folds leaving the strata in many cases ap proximately vertical but also to break and displace them along a series of thrust faults during the earth movements by which the mountains were produced Upon the economic map special attention is called to the distribution of auriferous NCE 791 slates in which alone there is any prob ability of discovering valuable deposits of precious metals These rocks are exposed in the southeastern and northwestern por tions ofthe area mapped and extend through under thelavas of the Lassen Peak district from the Sierra Nevada to the Klamath Mountains of the Coast Range The broad stretch of unaltered lavas about Lassen Peak does not contain any appreciable amount of precious metals and may be wholly neglected by the prospector Among the auriferous slates seven for mations have been distinguished ranging in age from the Silurian to the Jurassic in clusive Of these the Cedar formation of Triassic age has been the most productive By its disintegration it has furnished the gold for the placer mines of Indian Creek below Shoo Fly of Soda Creek Rush Creek the north fork of Feather River and Dutch Hill The Savercool mine by the north fork of Feather River is on this belt and active prospecting is g6ing on at a number of points Numerous copper deposits have been discovered in the Pit River region Intermingled with the auriferous slates there are eruptive rocks such as diabase porphyrite peridotite and diorite which have much to do in determining the distri bution of certain classes of ore bodies The areas of eruptive rocks have been outlined and it has been found that the most promis ing prospects of that region are located near the borders of these eruptive masses The ore deposits may be in the auriferous slates or the eruptive rock but in either case they are not far from the contact Traces of coal have been discovered in the Chico and lone formations but no de posits of considerable value are yet known in the region of Lassen Peak The Tuscan tuff has furnished some excellent material for chimneys hearths and water coolers The large deposit of diatom earth on Pit River having a thickness of over 100 feetN S VOL II No 50 and a length of several miles is of economic importance for polishing packing making explosives and other purposes FOLIO 17 MARYSVILLE CALIFORNIA 1895 This folio consists of 2 pages of text de scriptive of the Marysville tract signed by Waldemar Lindgren and H W Turner geologists and G F Becker geologist in charge a topographic map scale 1125000 of the tract a sheet showing the areal geol ogy another showing the economic ge ology and a third exhibiting structure sec tions The Marysville tract includes the ter ritory between the meridians 121030 and 122 and the parallels 39 and 3930 and contains 925 square miles The tract is located near the center of the Sacra mento Valley The larger part of it is oc cupied by the alluvial plains of the Sacra mento and Feather rivers The extreme northeastern corner includes the first rolling foot hills of the Sierra Nevada In the center of the tract rises the isolated moun tain group of the Marysville Buttes The alluvial lands consist of sands clays and gravels deposited by the shift ing currents of the streams The foothill region of the northeastern corner is prin cipally occupied by the gravels of Pleis tocene and Neocene age The area com posed of the bedrock series of the Sierra Nevada is sinall and consists of diabase and porphyrite The mountain group of the Marysville Buttes is an extinct volcano of probably late Neocene age the internal structure of which is to a certain extent laid bare by erosion The eruptive rocks of the buttes are andesites and rhyolites In describing the structure of the group three parts may be distinguished First the central core of massive andesite and rhy olite second the upturned sedimentary rocks surrounding the massive core evi by the force of the ascending lavas the sediments are of Eocene and Neocene age third the external ring of tuffs and brec cias The feature of greatest interest in connection with the Marysville Buttes is doubtless the presence of upturned sedi ments around the central core The shore gravels in the northeastern corner contain some gold and have been washed superficially Somewhat auriferous gravels are also found in the upturned sediments of the Marysville Buttes Coal and natural gas have been found in small amounts in the Marysville Buttes A GLACIER IN THE MONTANA ROCKIES THE section of the Rocky Mountains lying between the Great Northern Railway and the international boundary has thus far been but little explored Until the ad vent of the railway there was such diffi culty in reaching these mountains that only an occasional prospector or trapper pene trated their fastness As access has become easier it has been growingly evident that it is a region of remarkable scenic and geol ogical interest Thus far it has been reached largely from the eastern side but this has been troublesome from the fact that skirt ing the eastern slope of the mountains is the great Blackfoot Indian reservation over which it is impossible to travel without much annoyance Several glaciers have been known to exist in these mountains and two are located upon the military maps of the department of Dakota The largest of these is known as the Grinnell glacier from Mr George Bird Grinnell who has made a number of expeditions into the region and has done more than anyone else to attract attention to it The Grinnell glacier is not easily accessible and for some time efforts have been made to discover others which could be more easily reached by the ordinary dently brought into their present position tourist About a year and a half ago Dr 792 SCIENCE

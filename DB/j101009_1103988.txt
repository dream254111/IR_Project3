generation after generation of law students by the following passage from Blackstones Commentaries Book I 444 445 The husband also by the old law might give his wife moderate correction For as he is to answer for her misbehavior the law thought it reasonable to intrust him with this power of restraining her by domestic chastisement in the same moderation that a man is allowed to correct his apprenticesor children for whom the master or parent is also liable in some cases to answer But this power of correction was confined within reasonable bounds and the husband was prohibited from using any violence to his wife aliter quam ad virum ex causa regiminis et castigationis uxoris suae licite et rationabil iter pertinet The civil law gave the husband the same or a larger authority over his wife allowing him for some misdemeanors flagellis et fustibus acriter verberare uxorem for others only modicam castiga tionem adhibere But with us in the politei reign of Charles the Sec ond this power of correction began to be doubted and a wife may now have security of the peace against her husband or in return a husband against his wife Yet the lower rank of people who were always fond of the old common law still claim and exert their an cient privilege and the courts of law will still permit a husband to restrain a wife of her liberty in case of any gross misbehavior Those who accuse the makers of codes of a spirit of wanton radicaI ism might appropriately be confronted by the statutory definition of excusable homicide in the State of New York The board of statu tory consolidation in framing the consolidated laws were not at lib erty to change the substance or alter the form of existing law But it would seem that the adopters of the former penal code were im bued with a spirit of deep conservatism when they accepted section 203 which has now passed into section 1054 of the penal law This provision is as follows Excusable HomicideHomicide is excusable when committed by accident and misfortune in lawfully correcting a child or servant or in doing any other lawful act by lawful means with ordinary caution and without any unlawful intent It is of course still the law that a parent may administer corporal punishment in moderation to a child We should say however that lawfully correcting a servant in a manner that might inadvertently result in homicide is practically as obsolete as the lawful chastise ment of a wife An interesting moot court question would be how far under the doctrine of noscitur a sociis or something like it the statutory association of correcting a servant with any other lawful act by lawful means with ordinary caution and without any unlaw820 15 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb ful intent would serve as a defense civil or criminal in a case of the battery of a servant On February 24 1908 we called attention to an attempt to enforce an obsolete statute originally adopted by the Maryland legislative assembly in 1723 and incorporated into Aberts Compiled Statutes of the District of Columbia It prescribed the most rigid observance of The Lords Day commonly called Sunday under penalty of the forfeiture of 200 pounds of tobacco The Court of Appeals of the District of Coiumbia in District of Columbia v Charles Robinson 36 Washington Law Reporter 101 very properly held that the act was not enforcible Commenting upon the case we said The decision furnishes an illustration of the necessity of careful periodical revision of statute law The particular act seems to have been included in the Compiled Statutes of the District of Columbia without critical consideration and the present proceeding was the first attempt to enforce it It happened to be actually unconstitu tional so that it could be judicially condemned With regard to many statutes which have become obsolete in the sense that public opinion would not tolerate their enforcement yet are not repugnant to the organic law it is the custom for public prosecutors to treat them as dead letters It is much better however expressly to remove obso lete lumber from the statute bookChicago Legal News Concerning the Reading of CasesThe task of a law writer can very rarely be light if he undertakes personally to read the cases reported and to state the effect of them To ascertain the decision in a single case very frequently requires much patient thought and investigation and it will readily therefore be apprehended that to gather the law that results from a series of cases beginning perhaps at a distant period and most usually determined in different courts and by judges of unequal eminence is sometimes impracticable and is constantly exposed to the danger of error The authority of a case often depends on the court in which or the learning of the judge by whom it was decided The authority of a case may more over be strengthened by the circumstance that it was determined by a strong court by a court composed of judges of great reputation or by or with the concurrence of a single judge distinguished for his learning and be weakened by the circumstance that the court were equally divided or were not unanimous One authority or one series of authorities is contradicted by another a modern case and one determined some years ago or even two recent cases are found to be much if not directly at variance and cases that for years have uniformly flowed in a particular direction are not infrequently met by an opposing stream strong enough to stem the older current Ram on Assets

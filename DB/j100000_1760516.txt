reviews The London Daily telegraph states that an effort is at last being made to disinter the Sphinx The work of exhumation is intrusted to Brugsch Bey brother of the distinguished archeologist who will carry out a plan formed by Signor Mas pero About 20000 cubic metres of sand must be cleared away To expedite this task a little tram way has been constructed and 150 laborers are engaged for the more mechanical portion of the toil About Easter the work is expected to be completed Then when the rock out of which the statue has been hewn is laid bare a broad circular walk will be constructed ar6und it and a high wall built to guard against future encroach ments of desert sands A correspondent of the New York Herald says that it is very probable that Mr Rousseau who was sent by the French government to in spect the Panama canal must report that the present enterprise is inevitably to be changed from a sealevel canal to a canal with locks if it is ever to be finished by the present company thereby not merely falsifying M de Lessepss assurances a hundred times reiterated but also the very basis of the preference given to the Panama route over that of Nicaragua Regular subscriptions to the funds are exhausted and it is proposed to raise a hundred or more million dollars by a national lottery  It is expected that the Grecian canal con necting the gulfs of Corinth and Aegina will be completed by the end of the present year The canal will be less than three miles in length but the deepest cuttings are nearly two hundred and fifty feet in depth The canal will admit the passage of the largest ships and will shorten the sea distance between the Adriatic and the levant a hundred and thirty miles  In a recent paper the eminent French savant Alphonse de Candolle reproduces with approving comments the arguments of Prof A Graham Bell upon the production of a race of deafmutes in the United States In commenting upon the methods proposed to prevent this result he adds that the English language is the least favorable of all for spoken use among deafmutes as the movements of the lips are more often replaced by an accentua tion or intonation that does not produce any visible effect The vowels are articulated less clearly than and are not so sharply differentiated from each other as in the other chief European languages The French has very few words such as de and VOL VII No 161 crac in which the lips do not take part in the pronunciation while in English numerous sounds as of n th and h are formed almost wholly by the action of the tongue This is confirmed by the experience of intelligent deafmutes Mr Can dolle suggests in addition to the views of Pro fessor Bell that independently of deafmutism marriage between firstcousins should be wholly prohibited He also asks whether greater care given to newborn infants would not materially diminish the number of deaf persons  A new edition of Berghaus physikalischer atlas is announced to be completed in

connection with the use of oil on troubled waters is the frequency with which it appears as a new discovery Those who would dismiss the subject with a contemptuous sneer at the credulity of people imposed upon by sailors yarns know little of the prolonged attention the matter has received in the past and of the hon ored scientific men who have studied the problem There is no room here to quote the many observations at hand but only to sum them up and to present the explanation that has met with most favor The earliest reference at hand in English is found in Cavallos Philosophy  fourth American edition 1879 p 209 The author points out that oil spreads instantly over water that the wind has little effect in raising waves on the surface of oil or of water covered with a film of oil and that from early times this fact has been utilized in stilling the waves of the sea The experiments of Franklin and others are cited In Gehlers Physikalisches worterbuch  BerlinMARCH 5 1886 SCfIE 1837 band vi p 1750 ff there is a good presenta tion of the subject and many facts are cited Most of them are drawn however from the thirtypage discussion in Webers Wellenlehre 1825 Here one finds quotations from Aristotle Plutarch and Pliny which show that in early times the power of oil to quiet and so render more transparent the sur face of water was known References are made to other and later writers and to the facts collected by Franklin and details are given of experiments made by him Phil trans lxiv 1774 and later by the Webers From all these data as well as from the recent observations reported in Science especially vii p 134 it seems that the effect of the oilfilm is to diminish the  combing  of the waves and to prevent in part at least the formation of small waves and the growth and sharpening of the crests of the large ones by the continued action of the wind The exaggerated popular notion that the great waves are quieted seems to be erroneous The only known ways of destroying in the open sea the energy of a wave once formed are by fluid friction by rain and by an opposing wind But we must not under estimate the advantage of preventing the pilingup on a wave already dangerously high of another only a few inches high On the wellknown principle of superposition it must sometimes happen that the crests of waves belonging to two or more systems will coincide The resultant wave is then higher and exposes more surface to the wind  and the crest being sharper is more easily blown off by the wind so as the wave is likely to run faster than the ship it may break over her in a way that would not hap pen if it were only a little lower if onlv one of its smaller components could be suppressed It is further to be borne in mind in seeking an explanation for the indisputable and useful effect of oil that as the passage of a wave is the transfer of energy but not of matter the oil will not be carried onward by the wave  and that if the formation of new waves over a given large surface could be pre vented the old ones would speedily pass out of it and those coming into this surface from beyond would not be increased but would decrease some what because of the fluid friction The practical problem therefore before the ship master is to find some means 1Q of preventing the formation of new waves or the growth of old ones over a given surface to the windward of his ship and 2 of making this surface as large as possible He solves it more or less completely by the use of oil and now we seek an explanation of the action of oil from the physicist The German physicists of the first part of this century followed pretty generally the view attributed originally to Aristotle and elaborated by Franklin the Webers subscribe to it and Mfincke in  Gehler says it is generally held in a word the friction of the wind is less on the oil than on the water Stated in this way however the sentence is almost sure to convey a false impression We know of absolutely no proof that this is true if taken with its obvious meaning but the truth it embodies is simply that owing to the interposition of the oilfilm the force of the wind is not communicated to the water and this can be explained in a way consistent with mod ern physical notions Franklin had pointed out how a ripple raised by the wind gets higher broader and longer at each successive vibration and therefore WCE 215 travels faster he compares the effect of the wind to the setting of a heavy churchbell to swinging by properly timed impulses of a finger He thinks the adhesion between the oil and water is so slight if indeed the repulsion be not strong enough to main tain the film at a small distance from the water that the film can be moved a little by the wind without disturbing the water He suggests further that the wind can  catch hold of the large wave better when this is covered with ripples while if it be oiled the wind may press it down The Webers add some thing with reference to the resolution of the force of the wind which seems not quite sound in theory and Miincke has something to say about a slight bind ing of the surface of the water by the oil But some properties of fluids unknown to the earlier physicists have a bearing on the present prob lem Thus Daniell in his  Principles of physics p 247 says under the title  Superficial viscosity  To the same cause superficial tenacity we must at tribute the smoothing of the surface of a rough sea when oil is poured upon it the new surface has great superficial tenacity and small superficial ten sion and is not readily broken up into surf The bearing of this may be shown thus Imagine a per fectly calm lake a wind strikes it and it is covered with wavelets It is not the increase of pressure over the lake that causes the waves but slight differ ences of pressure between neighboring points due to the fact that the winds flow more or less in gusts not steadily If the surface were solid or very vis cous like mucilage or thick oil the momentary force due to the difference of pressure would cease to act before any sensible movement could take place The effect would be the same in kind though differing in amount however thin the film or slightly viscous the oil may be but we should remember that the super ficial viscosity which is effective here is usually greater than the viscosity calculated from experi ments where a considerable volume of the liquid is used The effect too would be the same in kind though the sea were rough instead of calm We see then that an oilfilm by its viscosity as well as by slipping over the water if Franklins view is cor rect delays the action of the winds force on the water for so long a time that the force may have ceased to act before any movement begins and then no work is done by the wind on the water Thus in an extreme case no new waves are formed and those driven on by the wind through the oilcovered sur face do not have their crests continually elevated and sharpened till they are ready to break What might happen in an extreme case does hap pen to some extent in every case where oil is used on the water Thus the wake of a ship generally shows a surface covered with bubbles more persistent than usual and comparatively free from small waves both effects being probably due to the traces of oil coming from bilgewater the cooks galley etc Where a ship is driven before the wind and the waves are running faster than the ship if oil is being used it is evident that the wind has to pass over a long oilcovered surface and the effect of the oil will be especially favorable Since it is essential to this explanation that the oil be spread to the wind ward little benefit is to be expected from the use of oil on waves coming from a distant storm nor when the wind is ahead unless means can be used to throw the oil a long distance ahead If this explanation be correct as we believe it to216 SUlTI be there is no violation of the fundamental law of modern physicsno destruction of energy The second practical problem is to cover as large a surface as possible with the viscous fluid Fortu nately this can be done easily in accordance with principles explained in many modern treatises on capillarity  for the surface tension of the film between water and air is so much greater than the sum of the tensions oilwater and oilair that a drop of oil is very rapidly drawn out over an enormous surface If this paper were not already so long some numeri cal data might be given The preference shown for animal or vegetable oils over mineral oils Science vii 133 is probably justified by the smaller surface tension and greater viscosity of the former though it may be noted that the greater the viscosity the slower the oil will spread other things remaining the same To render complete the explanation of this inter esting and at first sight puzzling action of oil experi ments are needed by physicists in the laboratory where for various oils the several physical properties above named shall be measured and also experiments and observations at sea when wind and waves are moderate enough to be measured and the captain may go in any desired direction without danger A few days observations where the conditions can be controlled would be worth hundreds of the desultory reports which the hydrographic office is wisely col lecting CHARLES K WEAD Professor Thorell and the American Silurian scorpion Professor Thorell who is perhaps the best authority upon the Scorpionidae both recent and fossil has rather severely taken to task some of my statements and determinations in connection with the recently discovered American Silurian scorpion see American naturalist for March 1886 p 269 In fact so sharp and pungent are some of his remarks that a person reading them would naturally infer that in Professor Thorells opinion I was hardly capable of making a reliable observation at least not upon a scorpion He has shown his good nature however in the outstart by admitting that the specimen is really a scorpion and not a Eurypteroid a con clusion the exact contrary of that jumped to by one critic upon reading the first announcement of its dis covery For this concession Professor Thorell has my heartiest thanks In his further criticisms how ever he is much less lenient and I wish to briefly notice his objections in their order After making the abovementioned admission Pro fessor Thorell proceeds to deal with the six ventral plates of this what he calls rather badly preserved fossil In my description in the American museum bulletin I mention that the specimen is greatly compressed  that the  dorsal crust is preserved over about twothirds of the surface mentioning the parts and that  over the rest of the praeab domen and what remains of the postabdomen or tail parts of the first five segments the inside of the ventral crust is exposed This feature of the specimen has I fear misled Professor Thorell and caused him to fall into an error into which if he had known the nature of the preservation of the fossils Eurypteroids found in the formations from which the scorpion was obtained he probably would not have fallen The specimen is greatly compressed i j NXCE VOL VII No 161 vertically as are all the fossils in the same rock Along the left side of the abdomen there is a line of fracture to the right of which the substance of the dorsal plates and the filling between them to the ventral plates below has been removed in split ting the rock and probably left on the other part Along this line the thickness between the two sides of the fossil dorsal and ventral is about a twentieth of an inch or less In speaking of this feature Pro fessor Thorell says The whole upper side of the abdomen is broken or cracked longitudinally and that the articulations of the ventral parts are all direct continuations of the articulations between the dorsals Neither of these assertions is entirely true The abdomen is partiallv removed but not  cracked  in the sense in which he uses the term  and the articulations between the joints of the ventral plates are not direct continuations  of those of the dorsal Besides this the overlapping of the plates show directly which is dorsal and which is ventral  and no zoologist would be apt to make the mistake If we examine the abdomen of a beetle roach or scorpion on the exterior we find the anterior plates all overlapping those behind both dorsally and ven trally but if we take off the crust and examine the inside we find the reverse to be the case that is the anterior edge of the plates overlaps the one an terior to it Now this is precisely what is seen on this specimen on the left side the anterior plates overlap those behind while on the right side the posterior overlap those in front and the surface of the plates is concave while on the left side they are convex so that a mistake is nearly impossible Pro fessor Thorells statement that if his interpretation of this character is the right one the want of spiracles on the plates needs no further explanation is therefore of no value as he reasons from false premises all his conclusions based upon his assumed features fall to the ground and the want of spiracles is yet unexplained There are six of these ventral plates plainly seen extending from beneath the dor sals Neither is the specimen a rather badly pre served fossil but instead an exceedingly well pre served and distinct one as far as the parts existed when the specimen was embedded In a footnote to his observations on the above structure Professor Thorell states that  even if the plates in question really were ventral plates the first or sixth when counted from behind forward would seem from its position to correspond to the anterior half of the first ventral in the ordinary scorpions and not to the small plate situated between the pectoral combs On this statement I will make no comment further than to say that I have failed to find in the living species which I have examined any case where the first or anterior ventral plate is even apparently articulated to the third ventral plate or has the lateral width of this one Professor Thorell next goes on to say that  Mr Whitfield thinks that whereas modern scorpions carry the tail postabdomen arched upward over the back Proscorpius and also Palaeophonus car ried it in the opposite way or curved downward He says  This would indeed be a character of fundamental importance for distinguishing the Silu rion scorpions from all other members of the group but that to him it is impossible to find any strin gent reason for adopting this strange hypothesis and that it would cause the animals gait to be exceedingly difficult and awkward if it were to walk

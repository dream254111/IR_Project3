FROGS I HAVE THOUGHT FIT TO CONSIDER OF THE ANIMALS OUR BUT CHERS CALL MAGGOTS WHICH OFTEN ARE FOUND IN THE LIVERS OF SHEEP WHEN WE HAVE WET SUMMERS WHEN THE SHEEP HAVE FILLED THEMSELVES WITH WATER WHEREIN THESE ANIMALS WERE THEY BEING CARRIED WITH THEIR FOOD OUT OF THE STOMACH INTO THE BEGINNING OF THE GUTS WHERE THE BLADDER OF GALL DOTH EMPTY ITSELF THESE ANIMALS BEING PLEASED WITH THE TASTE OF THE GALL SWIM AGAINST IT INTO THE BLADDER OF GALL AND FROM THENCE GO ON INTO THE VESSELS LIKE VEINS AND ARTERIES OF THE GALL FOR WHEN A GOOD WHILE AGO I DID SEARCH THE LIVER OF A SHEEP IN THE VESSELS WHERE OF WERE MANY OF THESE ANIMALS AND DID OPEN A NODOUS PART OF THE LIVER I DID FETCH OUT OF A GALL VESSEL ONE OF THESE ANIMALS WHICH WAS TWICE AS LONG IN THE VEIN AND WAS INDIFFERENT SMALL WHEN I HAD DISCOVERED THIS I DID FANCY THAT THE WORM HAD FORCED HERSELF INTO THE SMALL VESSEL SO THAT IT COULD NOT GET BACK AGAIN AND THEREFORE DID DYE WHICH HAD FIRST CAUSED A CORRUPTION IN THAT PART AND SECONDLY THE VEIN BEING STOPT UP BY THE WORM DID CAUSE A SECOND PUTRIFICTION AND MATTER TO DISCOVER IF POSSIBLE THE SAID ANIMALS IN THE WATER I DID GO IN AUGUST IN THE YEAR 1098 INTO SEVE RAL PASTURE GROUNDS ABOUT THIS CITY WHERE SHEEP DID FEED THAT WERE TROUBLED WITH THESE DISEASES AND THERE I HAD SOME WATER TAKEN UP IN A CLEAR GLASS OUT OF THE DITCHES510 DITCHES AND MOATS WHERE THE WATER WAS LOW WHICH I DID EXAMINE AND LOOK UPON WITH A MORE THAN ORDINARY MAGNIFYINGGLASS AND DID OBSERVE THAT SEVERAL SORTS OF ANIMALS DID SWIM IN THE WATER THE WATER WHICH I DID NOT LIKE I DID FLING AWAY AND THAT WHICH PLEASED ME I DID POWR INTO A GLASS BOTTLE THE GREATEST SORT OF ANIMALS WERE THESE THAT PRODUCE GNATS WHICH CARRY THEIR STINGS WHEREWITH THEY AN NOY BOTH MEN AND BEASTS ONE SORT OF THESE ANIMALS DID GENERALLY SINK TO THE BOTTOM AS SOON AS THEY CEASED TO MOVE THEIR BODIES AND WHEN BY MOVING OF THEIR BODY THEY CAME TO TOUCH THE SURFACE OF THE WATER WITH ANY PART THAT STUCK OUT THEN THEIR HEAD DID HANG DOWN AND THEY DID REMAIN HANGING ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER THE SECOND SORT OF THESE ANIMALS COULD NOT REMAIN AT THE BOTTOM BUT GENERALLY WERE CARRIED TOWARDS THE SURFACE OF THE WATER AND THERE THEY REMAINED HANG ING BY TWO HORNS THAT CAME OUT OF THE UPPER BODY ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER AND WHEN THEY WOULD GO TO THE GROUND THEY DID MAKE WITH THEIR BODY A STRONG AND VEHEMENT MOTION WHERETO THEY MADE USE OF AN INSTRUMENT THAT WAS TRANSPARENT AND WAS FIXED ON THE END OF THE TAIL WHEN I SAW THESE DIFFERENCES IN THE SAID ANIMALS I DID CONSIDER THAT AS THERE IS SEVERAL SORTS OF GNATS THAT TWO SORTS OF GNATS DID PROCEED OUT OF THESE ANI MALS VIZ GNATS THAT HAVE STINGS AND GNATS THAT HAVE NONE YET I FOUND MY SELF MISTAKEN IN MY OPI NION FOR I FOUND THAT ALTHOUGH THERE WAS TWO SORTS OF GNATS YET THEY BOTH HAD STINGS OUT OF THESE SAID WORMS CAME GNATS FROM TIME TO TIME WHICH DID PLACE THEMSELVES ON THE GLASS AND SAT ALSO DOWN SOMETIMES UPON THE WATER AND WHEN THEY DID SO THEY SPREAD OUT THEIR LONG LEGS ON THE WATER THIS511 THIS WATER I HAD ORDERED TO BE TAKEN OUT OF THE DITCHES ON THE 30TH DAY OF AUGUST AND WHEN I CAME HOME AND WAS BUSIE WITH VIEWING THE MULTIPLICITY OF THESE VERY SMALL ANIMALS THAT COME THROUGH THE WATER AND THAT OF SEVERAL SORTS I SAW VERY MANY GREAT ROUND PARTICLES OF THE BIGNESS OF A GREAT CORN OF SAND DRIVE AND MOVE IN THE WATER WHEN I BROUGHT THESE PARTICLES BEFORE THE MAGNIFY INGGLASS I DID NOT ONLY SEE THAT THEY WERE ROUND BUT THAT THE OUTWARD SKIN OF THEM WAS QUITE SET OVER WITH MANY PROTUBERANT PARTS WHICH DID SEEM TO ME TO BE TRIANGULAR AND POINTED TOWARDS THE END SO THAT IT SEEMED TO ME THAT IN THE GREAT CIRCLE OF THE ROUND NESS STOOD SUCH PARTICLES ALL ORDERLY AND EQUALLY FROM EACH OTHER SO THAT ON A SMALL BODY DID STAND ABOUT TWO THOUSAND OF THE BEFOREMENTIONED CONVEX OR PRO TUBERANT PARTICLES THIS WAS TO ME A VERY PLEASANT FIGHT BECAUSE THE SAID PARTICLES AS OFTEN AS I DID LOOK ON THEM DID NE VER LYE STILL AND THAT THEIR MOTION DID PROCEED FROM THEIR TURNING ROUND AND THAT THE MORE BECAUSE I DID FANCY AT FIRST THAT THEY WERE SMALL ANIMALS AND THE SMALLER THESE PARTICLES WERE THE GREENER WAS THEIR CO LOUR AND ON THE CONTRARY IN THE GREATEST THAT WERE AS BIG AS A GREAT CORN OF SAND THERE WAS NO GREEN COLOUR AT ALL TO BE DISCERNED ON THE OUTSIDE THESE PARTICLES HAD EACH OF THEM WITHIN INCLUDED 5 6 7 NAY SOME TO 12 SMALL ROUND GLOBULES OF THE SAME SHAPE AS THE BODY WAS WHEREM THEY WERE IN CLUDED AMONGST THE REST I DID OBSERVE ONE OF THE GREATEST ROUND PARTS SOMEWHAT LARGER IN A SMALL QUANTITY OF WATER BEFORE MY EYES AND DID PERCEIVE THAT THE OUT WARD PART BEGAN TO OPEN AND THAT ONE OF THE ROUND PARTICLES THAT WAS WITHIN IT AND WAS OF A DELICATE GREEN COLOUR DID SLIP OUT OF IT AND BEGAN TO MOVE IN THE K K K K WATER512 WATER AS THAT PART HAD DONE WHEREOUT IT DID COME AFTER THIS TIME DID THE FIRST ROUND PARTICLE REMAIN WITH OUT ANY MOTION AT ALL AND  WITHIN A SMALL TIME AFTER DID THE SECOND AND THE THIRD PART SLIP ALSO OUT ONE AF TER THE OTHER AND SO DID BY DEGREES ALL COME OUT AFTER ONE ANOTHER AFTER THE SPACE OF SOME DAYS THE FIRST ROUND PARTICLE AS IT WAS UNITED AGAIN WITH THE WATER FOR I COULD PER CEIVE NO SIGN OF IT AND WHAT DID ALSO SEEM VERY STRANGE TO ME WASTHAT IN ALL THE MOTIONS I DID SEE IN THE FIRST ROUND PARTICLE I COULD NOT OBSERVE THAT THE PARTICLES WITHIN DID IN THE LEAST CHANGE THEIR PLACE ALTHO THE PARTICLES NEVER CAME TO TOUCH EACH OTHER BUT DID REMAIN EQUALLY DISTANT MOST THAT SHOULD SEE THESE PARTICLES MOVE IN THE WA RER WOULD SWEAR THAT THEY WERE LIVE CREATURES AND THAT CHIEFLY IF THEY DID SEE THEM TUMBLE ABOUT FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER NOW AS THERE WAS A GREAT MANY OF THE SAID ROUND PARTICLES IN ONE GLASS WHEREIN WERE ALSO A GREAT MANY LIVING CREATURES I DID OBSERVE THAT IN THREE DAYS TIME THEY WERE ALL GONE SO THAT I COULD SEE NOR DISCERN NONE OF THE SAID PARTICLES IN THE GLASS MOREOVER I HAD A GLASS TUBE OF ABOUT EIGHT INCHES LONG AS FIG 4 A B AND OF THE THICKNESS OF A GOOSE QUILL WHEREIN I HAD PUT SOME DROPS OF WATER AS C D SHEWETH I LEFT ONE END AT A OPEN AND THE OTHER END B I DID STOP UP WITH A PIECE OF CORK SO THAT BETWEEN D AND B WAS NOTHING BUT AIR THAT THE WATER MIGHT NOT RUN OUT OF THE TUBE WHEN I CAME TO HANDLE IT THE AIR BEING SHUT UP IN THE TUBE BETWEEN D AND B IT CANNOT REMAIN IN THE SAME BIGNESS OR MAGNITUDE OR EXPANSION BUT DOTH CHANGE AS ONE MAY SAY EVERY MOMENT FOR YOU CANNOT COME NEAR THAT TUBE WITH YOUR HAND BREATH OR ANY PART OF THE BODY THAT IS A LITTLE513 LITTLE WARMER THAN THE AIR WHEREIN THE TUBE IS BUT THE AIR IN THE TUBE IS ALSO EXTENDED AND MORE MAGNIFIED THEREBY WHICH DOTH PUT THE WATER INTO A MOTION AND IS FORCED FROM D TO A ALTHOUGH WE PERCEIVE NO MOTION WITH OUR NAKED EYE NOW AS THE LEAST WARMTH DOTH EXTEND THE AIR THAT IS INCLUDED IN THE LESSER TUBE SO THE WARMTH IS ALSO EASILY GONE AGAIN FROM THE TUBE WHEREBY THE WATER DOTH RECEIVE A MOTION AGAIN FROM C TO B IN THIS WATER WERE TWO OF THE SAID SMALL ROUND PARTI CLES AND THAT OF THE GREATEST SORT AND IN EACH OF THEM WERE INCLUDED FIVE SMALLER ROUND PARTICLES WHICH IN CLOSED PARTICLES WERE PRETTY WELL GROWN IN BIGNESS AND IN A THIRD GREAT PARTICLE WERE LYING SEVEN LESSER ROUND PARTICLES WHICH LAST WERE INCOMPARABLE SMALL AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF FOUR DAYS SINCE THE NAMED PARTICLES HAD BEEN PUT INTO THE SAID TUBE I SAWTHAT TWO OF THE SAME THE OUTMOST SKINS WHICH WERE EXTRAORDI NARY THIN AND TRANSPARENT WERE BROKE IN PIECES AND THAT THE TEN PARTICLES THAT HAD BEEN SHUT UP IN THE TWO GREAT ONES BY THE MOVING OF THE WATER WERE MO VED FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER I OBSERVED FURTHER THAT AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF FIVE DAYS THE SMALL PARTICLES THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE THIRD GREAT PARTICLE WERE NOT ONLY INCREASED IN BIG NESS BUT I COULD ALSO THEN DISCERN THAT FROM THE INSIDE OF THE SMALL PARTICLES SHOULD COME FORTH ROUND SMALL PARTICLES AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF FIVE DAYS MORE THE THIRD ROUND PARTICLE WAS ALSO A LITTLE BROKE OPEN AND THE PARTICLES THAT DID LYE THERE WITHIN WERE ALSO GOT OUT AND ALTHOUGH IT WAS OPEN AT ONE SIDE YET DID IT TURN ABOUT IN THE WATER AND THAT AS NIMBLY AS EVER IT HAD DONE BEFORE SOME DAYS AFTER I COULD NOT DISCERN ANY BUT ONLY SOME SMALL PARTICLES WHEREOF THE GREAT ONE DID CON K K K K 2 SIST514 SIST WHICH ALSO IN A LITTLE WHILE DID VANISH I DID NE VER MISS A DAY BUT DID LOOK UPON THE SMALL PARTICLES THAT CAME OUT OF THE GREATER ONE AND DID OBSERVE THAT THEY DID NOT ONLY INCREASE IN BIGNESS BUT THAT THE IN CLOSED PARTICLES DID ALSO GROW BIGGER IN THE LATTER END OF SEPTEMBER I PERCEIVED THAT THE IN CLOSED PARTICLES WERE NOT SO EXACTLY ROUND AS THE GREAT ONES THAT INCLUDED THEM AND ALSO THAT SOME OF THEM WERE PROTUBERANT AND THAT THE LAST PARTICLES THAT WERE COME OUT OF THE GREAT ONES NOT BEING ROUND DID LYE AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE GLASS WITHOUT MOTION NOW THE LAST GREATER PARTICLES WHEN THEY WERE DIS CHARGED OF THEIR INCLOSED PARTICLES OR WERE BROKEN IN PIECES WERE ABOUT FOUR TIMES LESS THAN THESE THAT WERE COME FORTH FROM THEM WHEREFORE I MUST CONCLUDE THAT THEY HAD NOT THEIR FULL GROWTH OR NOT THEIR FULL FOOD I HAVE ALSO OBSERVED THAT THE SAID ROUND PARTICLES ARE OF AN EQUAL WEIGHT WITH THE WATER AND THIS BEING THEY MAY BY THE LEAST MOTION THE WATER RECEIVETH BY THE AIR ALSO BE PUT INTO MOTION I THOUGHT CONVENIENT TO GET DRAWN ONE SUCH BEFORE MENTIONED PARTICLE WITH THE PARTICLES INCLOSED WITHIN ITAS FIG 5 BY E F SHEWETHIN WHICH PART THE INCLUDED ROUND PARTICLESTHAT WERE INCREASED SO MUCHIN BIGNESS THAT THEY WERE READY TO BEINFERREDFLUNGOUTINFERRED DID NOT LYE IN ORDER SO WELL IN THE BEFOREMENTIONED AS IN THIS LATELY NA MED WHERE WAS NOT SUCH AN ORDINARY MOTION WHICH MADE ME BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS ONLY CAUSED BECAUSE THE INCLOSED PARTICLES DID NOT ALL LYE EQUALLY DISTANT FROM THEIR CENTER AND THAT THESE THAT DID LYE FURTHEST FROM THE CENTER DID MAKE THE ONE SIDE OF THE ROUND PARTICLE HEAVIER WHICH DID HINDER THE MOTION TO WHAT PURPOSE THESE ROUND PARTICLES ARE CREATED IS UNKNOWN TO US WHEN I DID PERCEIVE THAT THE MA NYFOLD ROUND PARTICLES THAT WERE IN THE GREAT GLASS WERE MIXT WITH A GREAT NUMBER OF SMALL ANIMALS WERE GONE IN THREE DAYS TIME I DID CONSIDER WHETHER THESE PAR515 PARTICLES WERE NOT CREATED AS FOOD FOR THESE ANIMALS NOW WHEN WE SEE THAT THE OFT BEFORE MENTIONED ROUND PARTICLES DO NOT PROCEED FROM THEMSELVES BUT BY PRO CREATION AS WE KNOW THAT ALL PLANTS AND SEEDS ARE PROCREATED VIZ THAT IN EACH SEED BE IT NEVER SO SMALL YET IT HAS ITS PLANT INCLOSED WITHIN IT WE CAN ASSURE OUR SELVES MORE THAN BEFORE CONCERNING PROCREATION OF ALL THINGS AS TO ME I PUT DOWN AS A CERTAIN TRUTH THAT THE SMALL ROUND PARTICLES THAT ARE FOUND IN THE GREAT ONES ARE SEEDS AND THAT WITHOUT THEM THE ROUND PARTICLES COULD NOT BE MADE I HAVE THIS SUMMER SEVERAL TIMES BEEN ABOUT THE WA TERS NEAR OUR TOWN TO EXAMINE THEM AND THE LAST TIME WAS THE 8TH OF OCTOBER 1699 BUT I COULD NEVER SA TISFIE MY SELF MORE I SAW AT THE SAME TIME A SMALL FROG LEAPING WHICH I DID JUDGE HAD BEEN AN EGG THE LAST SPRINGWHICH I CAUSED TO BE CATCHED AND WHEN I CAME HOME I DID PLACE IT IN A TUBE OF GLASS WHICH WAS AN INCH WIDE AND TEN INCHES LONG AND DID STOP BOTH THE ENDS UP WITH CORK YET AFTER SUCH A MANNER THAT AT ONE END THE AIR COULD GO OUT AND IN I DID VIEW THE TOES OF THE FORELEGS BY THE HELP OF A MAGNIFYINGGLASSTO SEE THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD WHICH I COULD NOT BUT WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY DISCERN BUT WHEN I CAME TO LOOK UPON THE HINDMOST LEGS AND DID LOOK UPON THE SKINS THAT ARE BETWEEN THE TOES WHICH ARE ON PURPOSE TO SWIM WITHAL AS WE SEE IN ALL THE FEET OF WATERBIRDS I SAW IN A GREAT MANY VEINS THAT WERE VERY SMALL THE BLOOD CIRCULATE WHICH DID PLEASE ME SO WELL THAT I DID LOOK UPON IT FOR SEVE RAL LAYS SUCCESSIVELY I DID ALSO OBSERVE THAT WHEN THE FROG WAS PUTTING OUT IS LEGTHAT THEREBY THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD WAS STOPT FOR A SMALL TIME BUT AS SOON AS IT STOOD STILL AGAIN THE BLOOD BEGAN TO CIRCULATE AGAIN WHEN I SAW THIS I DID IMAGIN THAT WHEN THIS ANIMAL DID THRUST ITS LEGS516 LEGS AGAINST THE GLASS TO CLIMB UP THAT THEN THE BLOOD VESSELS WERE THEREBY PRESSED AND SO THE CIRCULATI ON HINDERED AFTER THIS FROG HAD BEEN PUT UP ABOUT 24 HOURS IN THIS TUBE I SAW ITS EXCREMENTS IN A PLACE AS IT WERE ON A HEAP AFTER IT HAD BEEN THERE TWICE 24 HOURS IT HAD FOULD AGAIN THEN I DID LOOK UPON THE EXCREMENTS WITH A MAGNIFYINGGLASS IN THE FIRST EXCREMENT I SAW THAT IT HAD MADE USE FOR ITS FOOD OF AN ANIMAL WHOSE BODY WAS BESET WITH HAIR OF SEVERAL THICKNESSES WHICH WERE VERY SHARP POINTED WHICH I DID JUDGE TO BE OF SOME FLYING ANIMAL WHEN I DID LOOK UPON THE SECOND EX CREMENT I SAW NO HAIR IN THE BEGINNING THESE EXCRE MENTS DID LYE IN A CLEAR MOISTURE THAT WAS ROUND A BOUT THEM WHEREIN DID SWIM OR CREEP SOME EELS OR ABOUT 30 SMALL WORMS THE FORE PART OF THEIR BODY AND ALSO THE HINDER PART WERE VERY CLEAR I HAVE FORMERLY SAID THAT I DID OPEN THE SMALL EELS WHICH WE DID FIND IN VINEGAR AND DID TAKE OUT OF THEM SOME YOUNG EELS THESE EELS OF THE EXCREMENT OF THE FROGS ARE VERY LIKE THE BEFORENAMED ONES IF NOT ALTOGETHER THE SAME ONLY WITH THIS DIFFERENCE THAT THE EELS OF THE VINEGAR AS THEY COME OUT OF THEIR MOTHERS WOMB ARE SOME WHAT THINNER AND HARDER IN THE FIRST EXCREMENT I DISCOVERD ONLY TWO OF THESE EELS THE SECOND EXCREMENT I DID LAY ASUNDER THEN I DID NOT ONLY SEE SOME HAIR BUT ALSO A PIECE OF A FOOT PART OF THE EYE A PIECE OF A WING AND MANY PIECES OF THE SKIN OF AN ANIMAL WHICH I JUDGED TO HAVE BEEN A SMALL CREATURE WHOSE WINGS ARE COVERED WITH A SHEATH VERY LIKE THOSE WE CALL BEETLES WHEN I DID LOOK THE NEXT DAY AND SAW THAT THE MOISTURE WHEREIN THE SMALL EELS DID SWIM WAS PARTIY EVAPORATED AND THAT THE EELS DID MOVE BUT VERY LIT TLE I PUT A LITTLE RAIN WATER ROUND ABOUT THE EXCRE MENTS517 MENTS WHEREIN ALL THE WORMS AND EELS WERE THAT THEY MIGHT BE IN MORE MOISTURE THEN I PUT THE MOISTURE IN TO A SMALL GLASS TUBE WHEREIN WERE SIX EELS THINKING TO KEEP THEM ALIVE AND TO OBSERVE WHETHER THEY WOULD BREED ANY YOUNG ONES YET I FOUND THE CONTRARY FOR THEY DID MOVE LESS AND WITHIN A FEW HOURS AFTER SOME WERE QUITE WITHOUT MOTION AND THE OTHER DAY I SAW AFTER AN EXACT EXA MINATION ONLY ONE PART OF AN EEL LYE SO THAT I COULD FIND NO LIKELINESS OF AN EEL WHEREFORE I MUST CON CLUDE THAT THE EELS WERE DISSOLVED IN THE WATER SO THAT THERE DID REMAIN ONLY SOME STUFF WITHOUT ANY FIGURE OR FORM THE FROG HAD SO MOVED ABOUT IN THE GLASS TUBETHAT HE HAD SEPARATED THE DUNG HE HAD MADE FIRST WHEREBY I CAME TO SEE ALMOST A WHOLE WING OF A FLYING CREATURE HAVING BEEN ABOUT THE BIGNESS OF A  AND THIS WAS ALMOST QUITE WHOLE SO THAT I COULD SEE PERFECTLY THE GREAT NUMBER OF SMALL HAIRS WHICH DID GROW ALL OVER THE OUTSIDE AND ALSO UPON THE EDGE OF THE WING UNDERNEATH THIS WING I SAW THREE OF THE SAID EELS AND ANOTHER IN ANOTHER PLACE THAT HAD STILL A STRONG MOTION IN THEM ON THE FOURTH DAY AFTER THE EXCREMENTS HAD BEEN MADE I SAW SOME AS WELL ABOVE AS UNDER THE WING BEING ALIVE AND BEING THAT THE MOISTURE WHEREIN THEY DID LYE WAS BUT VERY LITTLE SO WAS THEIR MOTION BUT LIT TLE AND AFTERWARD I COULD PERCEIVE NO MOTION AT ALL FROM THESE OBSERVATIONS WE MAY VERY WELL CONCLUDE THAT THE WATER WAS NOT PROPER FOR THESE EELS BUT THAT THEY ARE COME OUT OF THE GROUND OR THAT THE ANIMALS WHEREOF THE FROG MADE USE OF FOR ITS FOOD WERE LOAD ED WITH THEM ON THE FIFTH DAY THE FROG HAD DUNGD AGAIN AND IT DID LYE OBLONG AGAINST THE GLASS WITHOUT ANY MOISTURE AT ALL I TOOK518 I TOOK IT OUT OF THE GLASS AND SPREAD IT ABROAD BE CAUSE IT WAS BLACKER TO THE EYE THAN THE BEFOREMEN TIONED AND DID SEE THAT THERE WERE ALSO PART OF FLYING ANIMALS AND AMONG THIS STUFF DID ALSO LYE SEVERAL OF THE BEFOREMENTIONED EELS BUT THEY WERE ALL DEAD AND SOMEWHAT LESS THAN THE FORMER FURTHER I HAD PUT THE FROG IN A GLASS WITH WATER WHEREOUT IT MADE ITS ESCAPE AND GOT AWAY DELFT JAN 2 1700

with STEINERS Extension of MALFATTIS Pro blem By ARTHUR CAYLEY MA Fellow of Trinity College Cambridge Com municated by J J SYLVESTER Esq FRS Received April 12Read May 27 1852 THE problem in a triangle to describe three circles each of them touching the two others and also two sides of the triangle has been termed after the Italian geometer by whom it was proposed and solved MALFATTIS problem The problem which I refer to as STEINERS extension of MALFATTIS problem is as follows To determine three sections of a surface of the second order each of them touching the two others and also two of three given sections of the surface of the second order a problem proposed in STEINERS memoir Einige geometrische Betrachtungen Crelle t i The geometrical construction of the problem in question is readily deduced from that given in the memoir just mentioned for a somewhat less general problem viz that in which the surface of the second order is replaced by a sphere it is for the sake of the analytical developments to which the problem gives rise that I propose to resume here the discussion of the problem The following is an analysis of the present memoir 41 Contains a lemma which appears to me to constitute the foundation of the analytical theory of the sections of a surface of the second order  2 Contains a statement of the geometrical construction of STEINERS extension of MALFATTIS problem  3 Is a verification founded on a particular choice of coordinates of the con struction in question  4 In this section referring the surface of the second order to absolutely general coordinates and after an incidental solution of the problem to determine a section touching three given sections I obtain the equations for the solution of STEINERS extension of MALFATTIS problem 4 5 Contains a separate discussion of a system of equations including as a parti cular case the equations obtained in the preceding section 44 6 and 7 Contain the application of the formulae for the general system to the equations in  4 and the development and completion of the solution  8 Is an extension of some preceding formulae to quadratic functions of any number of variables254 MR A CAYLEYS

most simple form the geometrical construction for the solution of STEINERS extension of MALFATTIS problem let the given sections be called for conciseness the determninators  any two of these sections lie in two dif ferent cones the vertices of which determine with the line of intersection of the planes of the determinators two planes which may be termed bisectors the six bisectors pass three and three through four straight lines and it trill be convenient to usethe term bisectors to denote not the entire system but any three bisectors passing through the same line Consider three sections which may be termed tactors each of them touching a determinator and two bisectors and three other sections which may be termed separators each of them passing through the point of contact  I use the words  determinators c to denote indifferently the sections or the planes of the sections the context is always sufficient to prevent ambiguitySTEINER S EXTENSION OF MALFATI S PROBLEM 255 of a deterrminator and tactor and touching the other two tactors the separators will intersect in a line which passes through the point of intersection of the determinators The three required sections or as I shall term them the resultors are determined by the conditions that each resultor touches two determinators and two separators the possibility of the construction being implied as a theorem The a posteriori verifica tion may be obtained as follows 3 Let x yO zO be the equations of the resultors wO the equation of the polar of the point of intersection of the resultors Since the resultors touch two and two the equation of the surface is easily seen to be of the form 2Yz2zx2xyw20 The determinators are sections each of th em touching two resultors but otherwise arbitrary their equations are ax 1   ox13i 2x w0 2jx2yy W0 The separators are sections each of them touching two resultors at their point of contact or what is the same thing passing through the line of intersection of two re sultors and all of them having a line in common Their equations may be taken to be yb 0 azcx0 bxayO the values of a b c remaining to be deternined Now before fixing the values of these quantities we nmay find three sections each of them touching a determinator at a point of intersection with the section which corresponds to it of the sections cybz0 azcx0 bxay0 and touching the other two of the lastmentioned sections and when a b c have their proper values the sections so found are the tactors For let Xvpyvzgw0 be the equation of a section touching the de terminator ax yzwO and the two sections bxay0 azcx0 and suppose A2X22 y2yg 2p 2 the conditions of contact with the sections bxay0 azcx0 are found to be baAbaXbap ba caA caXcafpcaP values however which suppose a correspondence in

the quantities X d v f are material thca Pba and therefore A2 2 22abc2b C22e Xbc2 or 2  2 axbc Whence the equation to a section touching bxay0 azcx0 is XxcaybazV2aXbc lw0 And to express that this touches the determinator in question we have Xbc 4az2abc2V2axbc and selecting the upper sign X2a2 2  whence  24aV2hc  2aXbc  2amV 2bc or the section touching the determinator and the sections bxtyO az

2bcw0 c4bx213b1  V2ca abz2b3V2caw0 bcxacy27cy V2abz2cyV2abw0 where a b c still remain to be determined Now the separators pass through the point of intersection of the determinnators the equations of these give for the point in question  Y z  W 2ry 1ca4ry2c3y  320r2 1  ez 2P2r2STEINERS EXTENSION OF MALFATTIS PROBLEM 257 and the values of a b c are therefore a In c2f rb1Ir2fy 2rxl1cAsr2c43 2 ap l

determinators x3W y IzwO 2y2yYyzwO And suppose as before A2x2 2 2 2pv20x 2p 22 the conditions of con tact are f3Lf3X 3Xp42g pr 7xrx7 yy where it is necessary for the present purpose to give opposite signs to the radicals For if the radicals had the same sign it would follow that or the equation xxpyyzgwO would pass through the point I 1 2 2 xyz  W0   or the section would be a tangent section of the two determinators of the same class with the resultor 0 which ought not to be the case The proper formula is i 3I3vp2 1ryyr  rDY2 0 And this equation being satisfied the section XxPyYvzgw0 passes through a point 1 1 2 2 x y z w22P 72 a The bisector passes through this point and the line of intersection of the determi nators its equation is 32xPY w x 24zwz  0 or reducing and completing the system the equations of the bisectors are 2Y  2 Z 1 22 Z 20X 2 p22  ai W 0 2   2L258 MR A CAYLEYS ANALYTICAL RESEARCHES CONNECTED WITH And in order to verify the geometrical construction it only remains to show that each bisector touches two tactors Consider the bisector and tactor 1 2x 12aY2 1 IjI 1I 2amV2bcx cay baz 2a4V2bcwn and represent these for a moment by XxPyvzwO XPyvzewO If A be the

theorem If two sections of a surface of the second order touch each other and are also tangent sections of the same class to two fixed sections then considering the planes through the axis of the fixed sections and the poles of the tangent sections and also the tangent planes through this axis the an harmonic ratio of the four planes is independent of the position of the moveable tangent

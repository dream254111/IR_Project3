WITH STEINERS EXTENSION OF MALFATTIS PRO BLEM BY ARTHUR CAYLEY MA FELLOW OF TRINITY COLLEGE CAMBRIDGE COM MUNICATED BY J J SYLVESTER ESQ FRS RECEIVED APRIL 12READ MAY 27 1852 THE PROBLEM IN A TRIANGLE TO DESCRIBE THREE CIRCLES EACH OF THEM TOUCHING THE TWO OTHERS AND ALSO TWO SIDES OF THE TRIANGLE HAS BEEN TERMED AFTER THE ITALIAN GEOMETER BY WHOM IT WAS PROPOSED AND SOLVED MALFATTIS PROBLEM THE PROBLEM WHICH I REFER TO AS STEINERS EXTENSION OF MALFATTIS PROBLEM IS AS FOLLOWS TO DETERMINE THREE SECTIONS OF A SURFACE OF THE SECOND ORDER EACH OF THEM TOUCHING THE TWO OTHERS AND ALSO TWO OF THREE GIVEN SECTIONS OF THE SURFACE OF THE SECOND ORDER A PROBLEM PROPOSED IN STEINERS MEMOIR EINIGE GEOMETRISCHE BETRACHTUNGEN CRELLE T I THE GEOMETRICAL CONSTRUCTION OF THE PROBLEM IN QUESTION IS READILY DEDUCED FROM THAT GIVEN IN THE MEMOIR JUST MENTIONED FOR A SOMEWHAT LESS GENERAL PROBLEM VIZ THAT IN WHICH THE SURFACE OF THE SECOND ORDER IS REPLACED BY A SPHERE IT IS FOR THE SAKE OF THE ANALYTICAL DEVELOPMENTS TO WHICH THE PROBLEM GIVES RISE THAT I PROPOSE TO RESUME HERE THE DISCUSSION OF THE PROBLEM THE FOLLOWING IS AN ANALYSIS OF THE PRESENT MEMOIR 41 CONTAINS A LEMMA WHICH APPEARS TO ME TO CONSTITUTE THE FOUNDATION OF THE ANALYTICAL THEORY OF THE SECTIONS OF A SURFACE OF THE SECOND ORDER  2 CONTAINS A STATEMENT OF THE GEOMETRICAL CONSTRUCTION OF STEINERS EXTENSION OF MALFATTIS PROBLEM  3 IS A VERIFICATION FOUNDED ON A PARTICULAR CHOICE OF COORDINATES OF THE CON STRUCTION IN QUESTION  4 IN THIS SECTION REFERRING THE SURFACE OF THE SECOND ORDER TO ABSOLUTELY GENERAL COORDINATES AND AFTER AN INCIDENTAL SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM TO DETERMINE A SECTION TOUCHING THREE GIVEN SECTIONS I OBTAIN THE EQUATIONS FOR THE SOLUTION OF STEINERS EXTENSION OF MALFATTIS PROBLEM 4 5

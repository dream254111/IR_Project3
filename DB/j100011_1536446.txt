cells by division and the germ cells form the vehicle of transmission from one generation to another If this be true we should look to the structure of the germcells fo an explanation of the phenomena that have been and are being found out in heredity Cytologists have discovered much concerning the structure of the germcells and the behavior of the chromosomes during the processes of maturation and division The combined knowledge of sex and sex ratio and the cytologi cal constitution of germcells has shown in many forms at least a correlation between the inheritance of sex and the dimorphism of spermatozoa or eggs or both However the vast amount of cytological work has been done with forms the behavior of whose characteristics in heredity is unknown On the other hand much of the work in heredity has been done with forms of which little or nothing is known of the structure of the germ cells It is the writers good fortune to have access to material of which some of the ancestry is known for eighteen generations covering a period of five years For a number of years Dr R K Nabours2 has been conducting experiments with regard to inheritance in Paratettix a genus of the shorthorned grasshoppers The characteristics used in his investigations are the color patterns of the pronotum and femora of the jumping legs and the lengths of the pronotum and wings The data show that the inheritance of the color patterns is Mendelian in its behavior In the F hybrid no part of the color pattern of one parent species is ever replaced by the color pattern of the other parent but the color patterns of both parents are present Reciprocal crosses give identical results The 1 Contribution from the Zoological Laboratory Kansas State Agricultural College No 7 2 The writer wishes to thank Dr R K Nabours for the grasshoppers which have furnished the material for this paper 262SPERMATOGENESIS IN PARATETTIX lengths of the wings and pronotum are not inherited but are closely correlated with the length of time required for the animal to reach maturity These grasshoppers have furnished the material for the present paper The work on the cytological constitution of the germcells of Paratettix has been undertaken for the purpose of discovering whether or not the microscope will reveal any differences in the germcells of very closely related forms which may be corre lated with the differences in the color pattern The spermato genesis of only one form Paratettix leuconotusleucothorax is given here Paratettix leuconotusleucothorax is a hybrid obtained by crossing P leuconotus with P leucothorax or by the interbreeding of two hybrids one being a hybrid of leuconotus with some other form and the other a hybrid of leucothorax with some other form No attempt has been made to show any relation between the structure of the germcells and the somatic structures This will be discussed in a later paper The chromosomal complex of the spermatogonia of Para tettix leuconotusleucothorax consists of thirteen rodshaped bodies which may be divided into two groupsone group con sisting of four larger chromosomes and the other of nine smaller ones Neither the larger nor the smaller chromosomes form equal sized pairs as Sutton has found in Brachystola magna and which is so frequently described for the Hemiptera and is ap parently characteristic of all Diptera All of the large chromo somes and one of the small ones are bent rods or slightly U shaped but the other eight are almost straight No one of these chromosomes has been surely identified as the accessory However in the early prophases there is always present a mass of chromatin which has a more compact consistency and stains more intensely than the remainder of the chromatin A Fig I This mass has not been identified with any chromosome nor is it associated with a vesicle as described by Carothers for Arphia simplex There appears to be no difference in the staining capacity nor in the compactness of the chromosomes in the late prophases Fig 2 The spermatogonial spindle is long and slender and has fine but distinct fibers which converge at the poles The centrosome 263MARY T HARMAN which is very distinctly visible in the metaphase stage is small and spherical It stains almost as intensely as the chromosomes The astral rays are short and indistinct The chromosomes are at right angles to the spindle fibers in the metaphase stage Fig 7 A metaphase plate always shows one chromosome nearer the center of the spindle than any other chromosome Sometimes it is completely surrounded by the others Figs 4 and 6 and sometimes merely one end is at the center of the spindle Figs 3 and 5 This chromosome is always one of the larger of the group of smaller ones but it is never the bent one Few anaphase and no telophaase stages have been observed Fig 8 shows an anaphase with rather indistinct spindle fibers which is characteristic of all the anaphase stages observed The cen trosome which shows distinctly in the metaphase stage Fig 7 is now invisible The chromasomes are no longer at right angles to the spindle fibers but are nearly parallel with them Fig 9 illustrates the condition of the cell at the beginning of the growth period The nucleus is large and comparatively clear Some of the chromatin is in a finely reticular condition and stains faintly with ironhaematoxylin However a mass of the chromatin retains the compact consistency and the density of stain of the chromosomes A Fig 9 It has a rounded form like a nucleolus The boundary between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is quite evident The nucleus continues to increase in size and the reticular chromatin which now has a greater staining capacity forms a thread or threads having a woolly appearance There is no polarization of the loops of the spireme but they occupy almost all of the space of the nucleus and form an irregular tangled mass The nucleolus remains at one side of the nucleus and does not have the woolly appearance that the spireme has Fig io In the synezesis or contraction stage the spireme seems to shrink away from the nuclear wall leaving a clear space between the cytoplasm and the chromatin material There is little difference between the character of the chromatin and its staining capacity in this stage and the preceding one The compact mass of chromatin never loses its identity and always remains at one side of the nucleus Fig II The boundary of 264SPERMATOGENESIS IN PARATETTIX the nucleus soon becomes irregular and the chromosomes of the primary spermatocyte is formed by a breaking up of the spireme thread into segments The compact intensely staining mass which has been traced through the growth period is shown in Fig 12 as a chromosome which differs in shape from the other chromosomes It is ovoid and without a constriction in the middle while all the other chromosomes are dumbbell shaped Not all of the chromosomes are formed at the same time The chromatin retains its loose woolly appearance until after it has broken up into parts then it gradually becomes more compact takes the stain more readily and each part assumes the characteristic dumbbell shape While this is taking place the boundary between the nucleus and the cytoplasm becomes more irregular and by the time the chromosomes are completely formed the cytoplasm has formed a vesicle around each of them Figs 13 and I4 The chromosomal complex of the primary spermatocyte con sists of six dumbbell shaped chromosomes and one ovoid chro mosome Of the six dumbbell chromosomes two are decidedly larger than the others and one of these is much larger than the other one as is shown in Figs 13 to I6 inclusive The ovoid or accessory chromosome is never among the other chromosomes but always lies near the periphery of the nucleus as it did in the growth period When the chromosomes have become arranged on the spindle the dumbbell chromosomes are well toward the center of the spindle while the accessory is always near the periphery It does not remain long in the metaphase plate but soon passes toward one pole undivided much in advance of the other chromosomes For this reason many sections of metaphase plates show only six chromosomes and those which show seven are often cut obliquely Not all of the chromosomes in the primary spermatocyte divide synchronously Fig 20 shows five of the dumbbell chromosomes divided while the largest one shows little constriction This division is transverse as is shown in Figs I6 and 20 There are no loops rings or Us which would give the least indication of a longitudinal division In the metaphase or early anaphases the centrosome is a small spherical body and takes the stain readily The 265MARY T HARMAN spindle fibers are fine but distinct The astral rays are similar to those of the spermatogonial divisions In the late anaphases the centrosome is no longer visible and the spindle fibers are indistinct There seems to be no resting stage between the first maturation division and the second maturation division The chromosomes of the second spermatocyte are ovoid Metaphase plates show six and seven chromosomes Figs 23 and 24 The accessory cannot always be distinguished from the other chromosomes It is either the second or the third largest It divides in this division and passes to the poles in advance of the others Fig 25 In the late anaphases all the chromosomes have coalesced although the number may yet be distinguished Fig 26 By the time the chromosomes have reached the poles they form a diffuse mass of chromatin at each pole and the cell has begun to constrict in the middle The centrosome which is similar to the centrosome of the primary spermatocyte has disappeared The spindle fibers have become indistinct As the constriction of the cell is completed the chromatin has migrated to the center of each daughter cell In the changing of the spermatid into the spermatozo6n two things are conspicuous from the beginning the changes in the character of the chromatin and the elongation of the cell body From the diffuse irregular mass there is formed an ovate body with the chromatin in a coarsely reticular condition largely around the periphery of it The cell becomes elongate and larger at one end than at the other The cytoplasm has changed from the tangled network to fibrillar strands of granules extending longitudinally across the cell The cell wall is quite distinct This condition is illustrated in Fig 29 The spermatid continues to elongate The nucleus becomes spherical and remains at one end of the spermatid The more granular cytoplasm lies toward the periphery of the taillike elongation There is a portion of the cytoplasm extending from the nucleus through the center of the tail which is more finely granular than the remainder and takes the stain less readily Part of the chromatin has become massed together forming a sphere situated to the side of the nucleus near the end of the lightly staining area of the tail The greater part of the remaining chromatin is dis 266SPERMATOGENESIS IN PARATETTIX tributed around the periphery of the nucleus Fig 30 As the tail becomes longer it becomes thinner and a filament extends from the nodule of the head through the entire length of the tail Very little cytoplasm now surrounds the head Fig 3I Finally the head becomes arrow shaped and stains very intensely The tail is long and filamentous and stains a little less intensely than the head The head and a portion of the tail are illustrated by Fig 32 The tail is more than four times as long as is shown in the figure McClung 14 says It seems very evident that in the spermatogonia of the Acrididae we are dealing with a chromo some complex of a very definite and precise organization which in the great majority presents itself without essential variation in number size and form fiber attachment arrangement in the metaphase and behavior during division of its elements Steno bothrus and Pamphagus seem to be definite exceptions in some of these respects   And again he says With the exception of the Stenobothruslike species and Pamphagus the students of the Acrididae have reported a reduc tion of the 23 spermatogonial chromosomes to 12 All of the genera of the family Acrididae1 discussed in McClungs paper belong to the three subfamilies Tryxalinae Edipodinae and Acridinae and none belong to the subfamily Tettiginae It would seem that with the general agreement of the great numbers of genera of this family which he and his students have studied as well as those of other independent workers that he would be justified in making the general statements concerning the family However Paratettix leuconotusleucothorax of the subfamily Tettiginae show some exceptions The spermato gonial number of chromosomes are thirteen instead of twenty three The number of chromosomes in the primary spermato cyte is seven This the writer has found to be true also for both the parent forms of the hybrid as well as for others belonging to the genus Paratettix 1 The writer is aware of the fact that there has been much shifting about of names of the shorthorned grasshoppers and that some taxonomists consider the the grouse locusts of family value If this should be the position which McClung takes then he would not consider Paratettix as belonging to the family Acrididae and it would follow that the observations recorded in this paper would not be excep tions to his statements concerning Acrididae 267MARY T HARMAN Robertson I5 says In the Tettigidae Tettiginse a sub family of the shorthorned grasshopper family Acrididae I have found for all the specimens of at least four different genera which I have examined the number of chromosomes to be uniformly 14 in the female and 13 in the male From the above data one would scarcely be justified in saying that the characteristic number of spermatogonial chromosomes of the subfamily Tettiginae is thirteen but the writer feels justified in saying that this is an essential variation in the number of chromosomes given in the above quotation from McClung as the number characteristic for the family Acrididae The writer has found no indication of multiple chromosomes In the prophase tetrad six of the chromosomes are always dumbbellshaped and one ovoid There are none of the irregu lar shaped chromosomes as described by McClung and no in dications of the annular chromosomes which he says that practically without exception every investigator of recent years who has made a careful study of the maturation stages in the Orthoptera has seen and figured If the dumbbellshaped chromosomes are similar to his Ishaped chromosomes they differ in that they do not have an enlargement in the middle but rather they have the appearance of a constriction This constriction is not due to the initiation of the division for it is present before the chromosomes are arranged on the spindle in fact they have their characteristic shape before the spindle is visible The presence of a mass of chromatin in the resting stage of the spermatogonial divisions which is of a different form and different staining capacity and also the presence of a similar mass in the growth period which can be identified as the accessory chromosome of the spermatocyte gives added evidence for the continuity of chromosomes as definite entities The spermatozo6n of Paratettix leuconotusleucothorax is very different from the spermatozo6n of Paratettix cuculatus as described by Hancock He describes and figures the head of P cuculatus as being small thin and acutely pointed In fact from his figure one would think that the head is very little thicker than the tail He says that the middle piece is formed into a 268SPERMATOGENESIS IN PARATETTIX high rather short protoplasmic keel No keel has been observed as forming a part of the middle piece of P leuconotusleucothorax The head is many times thicker then the tail and is decidedly arrow shaped The middle piece seems to continue from the head to the long filamentous tail without a definite dividing line between them SUMMARY I Paratettix leuconotusleucothorax has thirteen spermatogo nial rodshaped chromosomes four larger and nine smaller ones 2 Neither the larger nor the smaller chromosomes form equal sized pairs 3 The four larger chromosomes and one of the smaller ones are bent rods the others are almost straight 4 Neither spermatogonial chromosome has been surely identified as the accessory chromosome 5 In the growth period is a mass of chromatin which is more compact and stains more intensely than the remainder of the chromatin This is the accessory chromosome of the first spermatocyte 6 The first spermatocyte chromosomes are formed in vesicles 7 There are six dumbbellshaped bivalent chromosomes and one ovoid univalent chromosome in the primary spermato cyte 8 The accessory is near the periphery of the nucleus and passes to one pole undivided slightly in advance of the other chromosomes in the first spermatocyte division 9 The bivalent chromosomes divide crosswise 10 The accessory chromosome divides in the second division 11 The spermatozo6n has an arrowshaped head and a long filamentous tail BIBLIOGRAPHY Artom C 09 Cromosomi ed eterocromosomi nelli cinesi spermatogenetiche di Stauronotus

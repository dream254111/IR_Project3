British Museum New York Henry Frowde Oxford University Press American Branch 1902 pp xxiv 222  This is the first volume of the History of Egypt in the series entitled Books on Egypt and Chaldoea In the first chapter which embraces almost half the book the author gives an interesting account of excavations and investigations made during the past ten years by Petrie de Morgan Amelineau and others and discusses the results of the labors of these scholars He regards it as certain that many of the most important elements of Egyptian culture were brought into Egypt by a people who were not remotely connected with the Babylonians It would seem that this people having crossed into Africa probably from southern Arabia by way of the Strait of BabelMandeb conquered and overran Egypt and that the historical Egyptians are the descendants of the mingled conquerors and conquered Among the subjects discussed in this first chapter are the following Physical Characteristics of the Predynastic Egyptians Agriculture Domestic Animals the Predynastic Grave Religion Belief in a Future Life in the Predynastic Period Chapter II is devoted to an interesting discussion of Egyptian chronology Chapter III deals with the Legendary Period and with several predynastic kings Chapter IV treats of the kings of the first three dynasties The book is well printed on excellent paper has a map and some fortyfour illustrations and it may be warmly recommended to any one wishing to know the views of an eminent scholar in regard to the important period with which it deals J R JEWETT Die Religion

this opportunity to revise and enlarge the original edition Boston Ginn and Company 1898 To judge from this first of the ten projected parts the work will be considerably expanded Naturally as the author observes in his preface some portions of the whole work demand enlargement to a greater degree than others The first main division owes its expansion in large part to the necessity for dealing more fully with the themes of Chapter I Sources and Methods of Study and Chapter II Land and People The former topic islilior NVoices 58I ilow more broadly and freely handled for example in the statement of he present aspect of the Sumerian question pp I823 and the latter has all the advantage of the knowledge gained from the recent researches of the Pennsylvania expedition at Nippur the German explorations on the site of Babylon and the continued excavations of De Sarzec at Tello For the book as a whole this much is already clear as compared with the English edition it will gain in popular adaptation while losing nothing in scientific strictness and accuracy Especially useful will be the prom ised comparison at the end of the work between the Babylonian and the other ancient religions All who care for the history of religion must wish the gifted author success in the completion of his work in its new and expanded form J F MCCURDY MzVedieval JTiirope fromf 39510 1 270 By

often wished that this French text were available for general use in their classes  it was prepared by real scholars and seemed to have besides accuracy a certain combination of clearness with brevity and of definiteness with generalization that is not always found in such a book It is a pleasure to have it at last done into English and by competent hands Miss Sloan has usually given the exact meaning of the original though some times not its life Professor Adams has assisted in various ways in adapt ing the book to our conditions notably by modifying the references There are a good many misprints owing no doubt to the haste that was necessary in order to meet the demand of this year but they can readily be removed in another edition E W D Students of AngloNorman history will find little to interest them in the Histoie de lA4baye 1u Bcc by M le Chanoine Poree the first volume of which appeared in I9OI Evreux Charles Herissey pp xii 664 The story of the abbey is told in great detail often indeed in too great detail especially could much have been spared on the general monastic and religious history of the times already well told elsewhere In the treatment of its subject proper the book adds little to our knowledge and is to be noticed merely because it gives an account from the Norman side of much that relates to England of Lanfranc and Anselm and the abbey school of the English priories of the house and of the move ments on the continent of the Norman kings but these only in so far as they affected the abbey The authors interest throughout is wholly ecclesiastical and he turns aside to discuss independently none of the problems of Norman history The first volume brings the history down to near the close of the thirteenth century G B A582 Revziews

of in terest because it reminds one of how great an amiount of research has been expended in the last halfcentury upon the history of France in the six teenth and seventeenth centuries and of the stores of new material which have been brought to light When Miss Pardoe wrote The Cozurt and Reigrn of Fiancis I the portly volumes of YState Papers of the reign of Henry VIII edited by Dr Brewer i

beyond at least easy consultation As for authorities which Miss Pardoe dreamt not of one may mention the writings of the late De Miaulde la Claviere of Paulin Paris of Baumgarten of Phillip sohn of Hanotaux The author wrote when the brilliancy of Macaulay and Lamartine tinged historical writing She herself was gifted with a facile pen and transferred to her own pages something of the sprightliness she acquired from the reading of the memoirs and vivid chronicles of the age But as solid history verified by the witness of official documents and not de pendent upon the indirect and often inexact information of chroniclers and courtiers the limitation of her writings are manifest584 Reviews o B0ooks TFhe reviewer of illarIie le MAificis in the Atheneruln June I2 1852 may have been unduly prejudiced when he wrote W We object to liter ary millinery and added A compilation in English of French memoirs reads insipidly The present reviewer however is inclined to agree with him

in 1897 enumerated thirtyfour parish histories published in the province of Quebec Since that date an in creasing interest in local history has developed and an effort originating among the graduates of Laval University is being made to extend it to every parish in the province Quebec is singularly fortunate in having preserved a consecutive record in its parish registers which extend back to the days of the first settlement It was from these that LAbbe Tan guay was enabled to compile his massive Dictionnlaire GnMlogrique es Familes Caadizenlnes In addition to these the regular houses have either as landowners or as depositories preserved large numbers of papers so that the local historian has a mass of official material ready to his hand The Abbe Scott has just added to the series by the publication of the first volume of the history of the parish of SainteFoy situated in the well known selrneurie of Sillery four miles west of Quebec city and granted to the Jesuits in I640 Originally extending alonig the river St Law rence from the limits of the city to Cape Rouge it has been curtailed by the creation of two new parishes Saint Columb de Sillery in I856 and Cape Rouge in I862 With the exception of three short chapters de voted to the visit of Cartier and Roberval I54II543 the greater part of the first volume is devoted to an account of the famous Sillery miission to the Algonquins carried on amid much discouragement and suffering by the Jesuit fathers The author has gleaned most of his material from the Jesuit Relations Journal and other original authorities and has sup plemented it by printing as an appendix twentythree original papers either documents relating to land or baptismal registers Naturally his standpoint is that of the Jesuit fathers and intense admiration is ex pressed for their devotion and perseverance One interesting feature is a hitherto unpublished portrait of  Le Commandeur de Sillery pre served in the Seminary of Troyes in Champagne Of the five maps given in the volume tlhree have hitherto been unpublished On the whole it is an excellent piece of work worthy of  Une Paroisse Historique de la Nouvelle France  JAMES BAIN The New

local his tories there is apparently no end The field of the present one is quite accurately indicated by its subtitle  Stuaies Social and Topographical of the Town under Dutch and Early English Rule The author has made a selection of families and sites which figure in the records of his chosen period and has produced not a continuous narrative but a fairly interesting group of studies The houses of Dominie Bogardus and Van Cortlandt the affairs of Melyn and Van Couwenhoven and the incidents associated with the Bark Mill the  Ditch and Schreyers Hoek all receive careful attention In pleasant contrast with certain books of the kind the work before us bears traces of wide reading and has the hallmark of scholarship The writers familiarity with contemporary European conditions is mani fest though the descriptions of such matters as scenes in the Low Coun tries and events in the Thirty Years War are unnecessarily long The illustrations and maps are well chosen and there are an index and two appendixes Somewhat too specialized for the general reader the book can be commended as a scholarly and graphic sketch of life in old Man hattan EDMUND K ALDEN In the preparation of his recent volumes on the history of currency and banking in colonial Massachusetts Mr Andrew McFarland Davis examined the important rare pamphlets on the subject and became familiar with their contents Eighteen

with scholarly care and the papers are accompanied by satisfactory bibliographical notes The material in this form will be of use to the student of our financial history for as Mr Davis well says it

VOL VIII38586 Reviezvs of Books Series New York D Appleton and Company 1902 pp xxiii 330 Mr Mathews writes in vigorous style an interesting popular account of two series of historical events In the first seven chapters the successive Connecticut expansion nmovements into Wyoming and the Western Reserve are described after an introduction analyzing the nature of Connecticut as a community and its influence as a moral force in the nation The last five chapters deal with the composite origin of Ohio and show how under the influence of the Ordinance of I787 it pro duced the peculiar features of the first state constitution and led to the subsequent political prominelnce of Ohio in the Union Both parts of the book contain chapters giving lists of important persons born in Ohio and the Reserve The material is not original nor does the treatment in most respects fall outside conventional lines but the enthusiasm of the author and his complete sympathy with the Connecticut and other pioneers give the book a real value As an essay on the results of social and religious training in causing and affecting the settlement of new com munities it is of unusual interest But it is to be regretted that the authors enthusiasm was not placed under some restraint for the merits of the work are seriously obscured by the tone of unremitting and extrav agant eulogy which pervades it After the first two chapters the adjec tives huge colossal enormous sublime heroic un paralleled prodigious lose their significance through repetition and the whole perspective is felt to be distorted While no important error of fact has been notedexcept the statement that  the mantle of the dying John Quincy Adams fell upon the shoulders of Giddings  in I840 there is not a chapter which does not contain numerous claims for the unqualified superiority of Connecticut and Ohio in respects which will be challenged by the historians of almost every other state in the Union T C S A Hislory of fhe

The tale of the fortythree re maining years of the century is therefore left to the third volume which concludes for I900 with the visit of Paderewski to America the Hay Pauncefote treaty the centennial of the city of Washington and a Latin ode by Leo XIII At the beginning of the first volume between the authors preface and the body of his work is inserted a translation of Gerviniuss introduction to the history of the nineteenth century which first appeared in I853 This once famous pamphlet seems to have secured this honor from Mr Emerson on account of its eulogy of the democratic principle as exemplified particularly in the career of the English race in AmericaMAfwo Noices 587 Mr Emersons narrative has the merit of clearness It is always intelligible and easy to read despite the lack of continuity and perspec tive which its chronological plan entails Passages occur which are models of terse straightforward forcible sprightly description but at the end of them the reader falls upon pages heaped with the heterogeneous events of a decade  a sort of terminal moraine of unrelated facts If there is any one who wants to read the annals of one hundred years in their consecutive order he may find these volumes adapted to his desire Those who want a convenient work of reference concerning the events of the last century will however find here nothing but vanity and vexa tion of spirit for its one index is only a mockery and a sham Excel lence of narrative cannot excuse this fatal defect It is marvelous that the author should have been willinig to spend the time and thought neces sary to construct such a labyrinth of incidents and alltusions and should then have failed to prepare the clue which alone would render his work useful to the student TFhis criticism is the more inevitable because the authors view has so wide a range that quotations from the poets ac counts of battles and discussions of the fine arts jostle one another That page is not an unusual one Vol II p 635 which contains a reference to the Arctic voyages of Ross and Franklin to Mrs Shelleys Frankenstein and Keatss Endlyiiion to the first introduction of infant schools steamheating

titlepage calls attention to the fact that the work contains fortyeight pictures and two maps a ratio in illustration which may indicate that the books were originally intended for diversion rather than for study It is clear that the student who confines himself to Eng lish in his collection of handbooks of nineteenth century history must for the present continue to make use of such works as

prove informing to the general reader who wishes to learn at a glance or literally in an evening what great names and achievements political principles and diplomatic victories are connoted by the

sionally upon the Correspondzance de Nap oleDon je to illustrate the entire ocean blockade on the French and Spanish coasts In the principle of selection the volumes differ the first elucidating the system of blockade the second its general bearings The present volume opens with a project in June I804 by Captain Puget a sometime lieutenant under Vancouver whose name appears in Puget Sound to destroy the French fleet at Brest by fireships The bold but accurately laid plan fell throtugh partly by opposition in the admiralty In the succeeding pages AngloSpanish friction figures prom inently It centered in Ferrol where Cochrane was blockading a French and Dutch squadron and culminated in the seizure by the British in anticipation of pending hostilities of the Spanish treasureships from America For the rest the volume deals chiefly with Napoleons projected concentration of his fleets in the West Indies  the escape from Roche fort in January i8o5 of Missiessy whose direction was long a mystery to the British captains the sailing of Villeneuve from Toulon and Ganteaumes detention at Brest partly by Napoleons prohibition of an engagement with its blockaders On these and kindred topics welcome information is given Upon Cornwalliss division of his forces by dis patching twenty of his ships to meet Villeneuve on his return from America at Ferrol Mr Leyland ventures no distinct verdict Napoleon termed it an inszsne befise This censure need not discredit the opinion that these volumes prove beyond doubt Cornwalliss courage and strategic ability in general Napoleon in fact

of the personal side of Na poleon Bonapartes life character and surroundings Of the various monographs in this series those on the Emperors youth and his intel lectual and formative period are already completed those on his family his court and his generals are as yet unfinished Owing to the character of his plan M Masson is concerned with MarieLouise only as she affected Napoleon Hence he devotes the bulk of a stout volume of six hundred pages to the six years during which she was empress Although an en thusiastic Bonapartist he handles his problem in a broadminded and dis criminating fashion Seekinig neither to excuse nor to condemn he aims to describe MarieLouise in the light of original documents as she appeared to her contemporaries He attributes the erroneous judgments concerning her to the failure to take account of three facts that she was a German by race having no intimate or tender relations with the people among whom she was condemned to live in exile that she was an arch duchess by birth and carried to France an  historic atavism   and that she had been educated in an imperial court bitterly hostile to Napoleon and his subjects In spite of the fact that M Masson has been handi capped because of the disappearance of most of the correspondence be tween the Emperor and the Empress during the years from I812 to I814 his presentation is adequate and convincing The life and sur roundings of the Empress are described in minute detail but with a sense of discrimination and seriousness of purpose rising above the gossipy chronicle in this respect the picture of the Viennese court in the early years of the last century and the masterly treatment of the motives and influences leading to MarieLouises desertion of Napoleon are partic ularly noteworthy It is to be regretted that the author has not seen fit to indicate his sources But in an introduction which it should be said in passing contains many admirable suggestions on the method of treating a subject of this nature he frankly states his reasons for withhold ing his evidence They are in substance that footnotes break the con tinuity of the narrative  that unless given for every statement which is practically impossible they might as well be omitted altogether and finally that he does not care to be plagiarized or to be anticipated in the590 Reviews of Books part of the field still unworked Whether his explanations are satisfac tory or not perhaps M Massons position as a recognized authority in his subject will excuse him from neglecting the customary check against erroneous statement or unfounded assertion A L C La Principessa Belgiojoso i suioi Amici e Eemici i suo Tempo Da Memorie mondane inedite o rare e da Archivil segreti di Stato Per Raffa ello Barbiera Milan Fratelli Treves 1902 pp 436  Principessa Cris tina Belgiojoso is one of the most original of the many noble Italians whose collective activity roused the dormant patriotism hopes and cour age of the Italian peoples and soliciting the sympathies of Europe fin ished by creating Italian unity Born in I8o8 of the old and distin guished Lombard family Trivulzio endowed with delicate beauty a keen intellect an indomitable spirit and a fine independence which led her to disregard many of the conventionalities of society la Belgiojoso em bodied much that was noblest in the  Risorgimento while the story of her adventurous life opens before the reader epic scenes of exalted patriot ism and of heroic abnegation In Paris under Louis Philippe her salon was among the most brilliant in Lombardy her abilities and patriotism were so feared by Austria that she was tried for high treason and her rich property was twice confiscated but in united Italy her name has passed almost into oblivion from which the present volume may be said to have rescued it Barbiera is a fascinating writer whose facile pen in the present work reproduces with remarkable realism the dramatic scenes of which la Belgiojosos life is full and in a series of sketches drawn after diligent study he gives a clear and just conception of her character and career The volume is not an exhaustive biography nor has the writer succeeded in solving all the problems connected with the life of the Princess His method may perhaps be criticized as giving too great prominence to some of the celebrated characters with whom she came in contact and by whom especially in Paris she was surrounded  Thiers de Musset George Sand Mamiani Tommaseo Massari Gioberti Cavour It cannot be said how ever that the central figure is ever obscured but rather that the clever and generally faithful portraits of her satellites her fellowworkers her enemies all accentuate the readers interest in la Belgiojoso herself and heighten his appreciation of her radiating influence In the preparation of his work Barbiera has made extensive researches among both edited and inedited sources the results of which are of the first importance to the historian His studies in the royal archives of Milan have revealed pertinent facts relative to the police system and political persecutions of Austria in Lombardy during the early days of young Italy his studies of obscure published sources have enabled him to give a touching picture of the life of the Italian political exiles in Paris with its companion picture of the brilliantly intellectual and patriotic salon of the Italian Princess while other studies of inedited documents and correspondence lend origiMinor Noices 591 nality to his chapters upon the part played by la Belgiojoso in the revo lutions of I848I849 upon her theatrical entry into Milan at the head of two hundred volunteers equipped at her own expense and upon her weeks of tireless devotion to the wounded and dying in the hospitals of Rome termed by Barbiera  the apex of her greatness Her various writings and the fruits of her journalistic energy are examined with rela tive fulness Altogether the volume is a good piece of work worthy of Barbieras reputation as a writer of readable biography and history and takes its place with his II Salotto diella Contessa Maffei as the best of his publications HARRY NELSON GAY The publication of a new edition of Angelo Brofferios I miei Tempi Memorie in ten to twelve volumes has been undertaken by the editors Renzo Streglio e C of Turin it being the first part of a larger collection intended to comprise the writers principal literary and political works From the two volumes which have already been issued it appears that the Memorie are not being critically reedited and that excepting a brief preface and a possible but as yet unannounced subjectindex the new edition will contain nothing which is not to be found in the original edition of which Series I published in twenty volumes in Turin I857 i86i has been long out of print and is very scarce These Memorie have been widely quoted by historians and are recognized as a primary source indispensable to students of the social and political conditions of Italy during the first sixty years of the nineteenth century Brofferio lawyer poet dramatist and journalist was an honest and fiery leader of the op position in the Piedmontese Parliament from the date of its creation in I848 and parts of the later volumes of Series I deal at special length with the political questions current during the years i859I86o some chapters having been published also separately as polemical pamphlets directed against the policy and government of Cavour The work owing to its unchronological and confused arrangement presents great difficulties to the student who would consult it in research and it is to be hoped that the new edition will be provided with a full subjectindex unfortunately wanting iri the original edition The pub

psychological study of Joseph Smith Jr By I Woodbridge Riley with an introductory preface by Pro fessor George Trumbull Ladd New York Dodd Mead and Company 1902 pp xx 446 This book is a valuable addition to the literature of Mormonism It is an exhaustive study of the personality and the history of its founder As its title imnplies it is distinctly a psychological study but in making this the author has traced the family history for genera tions preceding that of Smith and has considered each detail of his life and work As a result we have an able argument in favor of Smith as the genuine author of the Book of Mormon and the leading power in Mor monism It is an interesting and forceful argument against the theories that charge Smith with forgery claiming that his ignorance made his author ship of the book impossible Mr Riley does not deny Smiths ignorance but claims that the abnormal activities of his mind give psychological proof of the possibility of such authorship His neuropathic antecedents his peculiar mentality the unnatural religious environment of his early life are all made accountable for the abnormal personality which was shown as  prophet seer revelator faithhealer exorcist and occultist  The book is not only of peculiar value to the students of psychology but it is written with a freshness and a clearness that appeal to the average reader The story of Smiths early life and environment is perhaps the strongest part of the book In a full appendix are given the contents of the Book of Morinon and an account of the SpauldingRigdon theory of this

outline of MaineJlluwlor Noices 593 from the time of the earliest explorations and settlement up to the present The remaining eight chapters are devoted to the analysis of the constitu tion and an exposition of the central and local government Of especial interest is Appendix B which contains excerpts from selected historical documents the early charters referring to Maine while a part of Massa chusetts the articles of separation and the acts admitting Maine into the Union together with the full text of the constitution For convenient reference to the general reader nothing better could be arranged than Appendix C which gives the state government in outline This appendix may also serve students as a tabulated form for review of the whole book Particularly interesting is Professor MacDonalds treatment of local government The people of the state ought to know minutely the work ings of county and town organization and of the party machinery em ployed while the student of politics everywhere needs just such an ex position of the peculiarities of each of the New England states in order to compare and contrast the very different systems of the western and south ern portions of our country GEORGE EMORY FELLOWS

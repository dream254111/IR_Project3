XXVIII A Supplement to Mons Pingres Memoir on the Parallax of the Sun In a Letter from him to the Royal Society Translated by M Maty M D F R S Gentlemen I Had the honour to send you my me moir on the Parallax of the Sun as de duced from the observations of Venus give me leave to add to it some remarks which I have since made and communicated to our academy The learned Societies of Europe amongst which yours holds a most distinguished rank will be the judges of the success of our expeditions A definitive decision will probably not be formed till after the observation of the transit of 1769 in expectation of further ac counts which may tend towards this decision there is at least one which I now submit to your ex amination Read May 17 1764 Supplement to my Memoir on the Parallax of the Sun I impatiently expected the first volume of the Philosophical Transactions of the year 1761 where I hoped to find some observations that might deter mine which of the observations viz that of Mess Mason and Dixon made at the Cape of GoodHope or that which was made at the island Rodriguez by Mr Thuillier and myself deserved the preference The first reduces the Suns Parallax to 8 12 at most 3 whereas153 whereas the latter increases it to near 10 12 the dif ference is too considerable not to deserve an enquiry into its causes The expected volume is at last come to hand and my first care has been to examine with the most scrupulous attention the observation made at the Cape I owe this testimony to truth that this observation as well as all the others of Mess Mason and Dixon appears to me to have been made with great judgment An exception might however be made as to the extensive description of an appulse of  Sagittarii to the Moons southern limb which is found page 389 This certainly was more than an appulse and the star was really immerged at the Cape In this same volume I found two observations which would be decisive if time and other circum stances had permitted them to be made with suffici ent accuracy I have very carefully calculated them both Mr Maskeline observed at the island of St Helena situated at 15d 55South latitude and ac cording to Dr Halley at 33 17 of time West of the Observatory at Paris but this determination of the longitude does not seem sufficiently exact I have compared many observations of Jupiters Satellites immersions and emersions made at the island of St Helena by Mr Maskeline with the corresponding ones made at Paris at the Marine Observatory by Mr Messier and have only found 31 56 for the differ ence of longitude between the two places and as the Marine Observatory is 2 East of the Royal Ob servatory I think I may conclude that the place where Mr Maskeline observed is only at 31 54 West of the Royal Observatory V O L LIV X The154 The clouds greatly obstructed Mr Maskelines observations he could make but one that was use ful At 7h 31 07 in the morning apparent time the bodies both of the Sun and of Venus being per fectly well defined the distance of the nearest limbs was by means of an objectglass Micrometer adapted to a reflecting telescope according to Mr Dollonds invention found to be 1 44 34 I have computed that by allowing 10 for the horizontal parallax of the Sun from that phasis to the internal contact of the limbs there must have passed 34 52 at St Helena I have even assured myself by some other calculations that by an alteration of one or two se conds in the parallax and of several minutes of time in the longitude of St Helena the interval which I have just now determined would suffer an increase or diminution but of very few seconds The internal contact of the limbs must therefore have happened at St Helena at 8h 05 59 in the morning One cant suppose it to have happened later because 17 after or at about 8h 23 the skies having cleared again nothing more could be seen and the external contact was over This observation being compared with that of Tobolsk would give 11 for the horizontal par allax which is a little too much Mr Maskeline observes that tho Venuss limb and the Suns appeared as defined as could be desired yet when the artificial internal contact of Venuss limb with the Suns was made by means of the objectglass micrometer Ve nuss limb dilated and contracted itself alternately getting and losing a small space within the Suns limb He adds that he endeavoured to take it in the middle of this vibration but dares not affirm that he ex actly155 actly did so Let the distance determined by Mr Maskeline be only diminished by 2 and his obser vation will perfectly agree with mine but in order to make it tally with that of the Cape it would be necessary to diminish this distance by 10 or 11 and it is not very likely that Mr Maskeline should have committed such an error His observation might likewise be brought to coincide with mine by mak ing a diminution of 40 or 45 in the Western longi tude of St Helena as I just now settled it whereas it would be necessary to take several minutes from that longitude in order to make the observation agree with that of the Cape which does not seem possible Hence though I dont take Mr Maskelines obser vation to be in itself absolutely decisive yet I am perswaded that it adds great weight to the exactness of mine Fort St George at Madrass is according to Mr Hirst 13 d 8North latitude and 3 4 of time East ward of Pondicherry and consequently at least 5h 12 54 Eastward of our Observatorys meridian Mr Hirsts observation is related in the Philosophical Trans actions the interval observed by him between the two internal contacts was 5h 51 43 greater by 2 49 34 than that which was observed at Tobolsk This would give 9 56 for the Suns horizontal parallax a quantity which is about a medium between the Cape observation and mine The comparison between the time of observing the contacts and that of the cor responding observations made in other places gives conclusions so vastly different that I dare not relate them here Mr Hirst gives a sufficient account of his instruments but he does not say whether his X 2 pendulum156 pendulum or clock was one with weights He says he regulated his clock by equal altitudes and then by meridional passages of Spica Virginis and of the Sun but why did he leave off the method of the equal altitudes which he made use of at first and in what manner did he observe these altitudes to deter mine the passage either of a fixed star or of the Sun over the meridian It does not appear that he had a quadrant or transit instrument I am sorry that this uncertainty about the means employed by Mr Hirst to determine the time of the phases puts it out of my power to make use of an observation which might otherwise have been extremely useful had the astronomer been equally well provided with instru ments as he appears to have knowledge and zeal It is to be observed that by increasing or diminishing by 10 the duration observed at Madrass the ques tion of the parallax will be decided conformably ei ther to the observation of Rodriguez or that of the Cape In the same volume of the Transactions are some observations of the same transit made at Abo and at Hernosand the total duration was observed in both places it may have been lengthened somewhat be yond its limits but these observations agree at least in this point with all the others that were made in the North viz that being compared with the To bolsk observation with regard to the duration of the transit they give above 10 for the horizontal par allax of the Sun I have likewise lately had the communication of Mr Rumowskis observation made at Selenginsk in Si beria I shall not expatiate upon the particulars here 2 supposing157 supposing that you Gentlemen have received it The latitude of Selenginsk is 51d6 6 I have settled the longitude to be 6h 57 50 from the Paris meridian Some immersions of the first and second satellite of Jupiter have given me 6h 57 15 6h 57 20 and 6h 58 31 by comparing the observations of Mr Rumowski with the tables corrected upon the obser vations made at Paris and at the Cape and estimat ing as well as I was able the different effects of the reflectors and telescopes The 15th of July Mr Le Monnier observed the meridional transit of  Sa gittarii at 18h 25 38 23 of his clock being at 76 00 45 from the zenith The preceding limb of the Moon passed at 18h 38 28 12 or at 11h 01 40 apparent time when the center passed the distance of the upper limb was at 75d 52 00 from the zenith and the lower at 76d 22 25 the threads which are 5 thick being entirely upon the Moon  Sagittarii had passed at 18h 35 22 12 the distance from the zenith being 75d 22 20 I have observed at Rodriguez the immersion of  Sagittarii at 14h 01 28 12 apparent time and Mr Rumowski observed at Selenginsk the immersion of  at 11h 24 51 apparent time Upon comparing all these things together I find the lon gitude of Selenginsk to be 6h 57 21 12 East from Paris But this goes upon the supposition that the error of the tables has been quite constant during near 7 hours which cannot be warranted Lastly the observation of the eclipse of the Sun made at Selenginsk June 3 1761 compared with the same observation made at Tobolsk and at Cajanebourg determines the longitude of Selenginsk 5h 16 41 12 East from Cajanebourg and at 2h 34 30 East from Tobolsk consequently 6h 58 22 East158 East from Paris These are the reasons which make me believe that the longitude of Selenginsk cannot be made less than 6h57 50 from the meridian of our Royal Observatory This being supposed the ob servation of Mr Rumowski compared with mine would give 10 1 for the horizontal parallax of the Sun in the month of June and 10 26 for that par allax when the Sun is at the mean distance Tis true the same observation compared with that of Mess Mason and Dixon would much reduce this par allax and therefore it can be of no use to decide the question unless we had some from Africa or from the adjacent seas I have one which I have not dared yet to lay be fore our Academy it appears to me a downright phe nomenon As it was made at the isle of France or Mauritius it might pretend to the glory of deciding between Mess Mason and Dixon and me but it is such a one as can only at most determine how far the difference of sights or that of telescopes could ex tend or shorten the duration of the exit I am ac quainted with the observer Mr de Seligny an officer in the service of the East India company and I think I can answer for his capacity talents zeal and accu racy He had no instrument but an eight foot teles cope and an excellent clock this he regulated by altitudes of the Sun taken the 5th and 6th of June with Hadleys quadrant That method is not strictly true but our observer could do no better and besides whether the clock went too fast by a few seconds more or less the difference cannot at all affect the duration observed by Mr de Seligny His clock on the 5th of June about 3 oclock advanced 18 12 upon the 4159 the apparent the 6th at the same hour it got only 9 The observer was obstructed by the clouds till near the instant of the exit of Venus This is his observa tion of the exit the times are those of his clock from which 2 0 are to be substracted to have the apparent time At 0h28 8 the preceding limb of Venus appeared to touch exactly that of the Sun at 0h22 0 one quarter of her diameter was got out at 0h25 10 Mr Seligny judged her to be half got out at 0h28 06 the three quarters of her diameter were emerged and 0h31 12 the exit was total and instantaneous These observations follow one another very well and they have been made by a man whom I know to be very skilful but how the exit of Venus could appear to him to have taken up but 12 34 I must leave to persons skilled in natural philosophy to account for The observation of the first contact or of the internal contact of the limbs would give you more than 12 for the parallax that of the last would reduce it to eight by a medium the parallax would exceed 10 You will undoubtedly have observed a pretty re markable difference between my observations of Venus as I had the honour to send them to you from Lisbon March 6 1762 and the same observa tions as I have related them in my memoir I ima gined I had sent the correction to some one of the members of your celebrated Society When I made the reduction of these observations at Rodriguez I found myself under disagreeable circumstances and it was probably my uneasiness at that time that occasioned a want of due attention which I was the longer in finding out as I could not easily sus pect160 pect it My clock went too slow that day at noon by 2 2 so that I ought to have added 1 2 to the time of the clock whereas I substracted as much from it This is the reason of the difference in the times The small variation in the distances of the limbs was owing to a stricter verification of the parts of my micrometer I am with the most respectful esteem Gentlemen Paris Feb 14 1764 your most obedient humble servant Pingre XXIX An

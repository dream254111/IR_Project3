AND ENGLISHED OUT OF THE JOURNAL DES SCAVANS CONCERNING SEVERAL SPOTS LATELY DISCO VERD THERE IN THE PLANET VENUS TO GIVE YOU SOME ACCOUNT OF MY PRESENT STUDIES I SHALL ACQUAINT YOU THAT HAVING BEEN A GOOD WHILE VERY ASSIDU OUS AND CAREFUL IN MAKING OBSERVATIONS OF VENUS TO SEE WHE THER THAT PLANET DID NOT TURN ABOUT ITS AXIS BY A MOTION LIKE TO THAT OF JUPITER AND MARS I MET AT FIRST WITH MANY DIFFICULTIES BUT AT LAST CONSIDERING THAT I SHOULD SUCCEED BETTER IN MY OBSER VATIONS AT A TIME WHEN VENUS IS AT A GOOD DISTANCE FROM THE EARTH THAN WHEN SHE IS NEAR THERETO I ATTENTIVELY OBSERVD WHEN SHE WAS RISEN SOMEWHAT HIGH ABOVE THE HORIZON AND SHIND BRIGH TER WHETHER I COULD NOT DISCERN IN HER SOME PART REMARKABLE EITHER BY ITS BRIGHTNESS OR OBSCURITY AMONG THE REST ESPECIALLY ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF HER DISK AND THIS I DID NOT IN VAIN FOR I DIS COVERD AT LAST TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF HER BODY A PART CLEARER THAN THE REST BY WHICH ONE MIGHT JUDGE OF THE MOTION OR THE REST OF THIS PLANET THE FIRST TIME I SAW IT WAS OCTOBER 14 1666 H 5 45 P M AND THEN THIS BRIGHT PART WAS VERY NEAR THE CENTER ON THE NORTH SIDE AND AT THE SAME TIME I OBSERVED WESTWARD TWO OBSCURE SPOTS SOMEWHAT OBLONG BUT I COULD NOT THEN SEE THAT RESPLEN DENT PART LONG ENOUGH TO CONCLUDE ANYTHING FROM THENCE NOR WAS I ABLE TO SEE ANY THING WELL OF THOSE PARTS TILL APRIL 28 1667 ON WHICH DAY A QUARTER OF AN HOUR BEFORE SUNRISING I SAW AGAIN A BRIGHT PART SCITUATED NEAR THE SECTION AND DISTANT FROM THE SOUTHERN HORN A LITTLE MORE THAN 14 OF ITS DIAMETER AND NEAR THE EASTERN RING I SAW A DARK AND SOMEWHAT OBLONG SPOT WHICH WAS NEARER TO THE NORTHERN THAN THE SOUTHERN HORN AT THE RISING OF THE SUN I PERCEIVED THAT THIS BRIGHT PART WAS THEN NO MORE SO NEAR THE SOUTHERN HORN BUT DISTANT FROM IT 13 OF ITS DIAMETER THIS GAVE ME GREAT SATISFACTION BUT T T T 2 I616 I WAS SURPRISED AT THE SAME TIME TO FIND THAT THE SAME MO TION WHICH WAS MADE FROM SOUTH TO NORTH IN THE INFERIOUR PART OF THE DISK WAS ON THE CONTRARY MADE FROM NORTH TO SOUTH IN THE SUPERIOUR PART WHENCE THE DETERMINATION OF THE MOTION MAY BE BETTER TAKEN FOR WE HAVE NO EXAMPLE OF THE LIKE MOTION EXCEPT IT BE IN THAT OF THE LIBRATION OF THE MOON THE NEXT DAY AT THE RISING OF THE SUN THE SAID BRIGHT PART WAS NOT FAR FROM THE SECTION AND DISTANT FROM THE SOUTHERN HORN 14 OF THE DIAMETER WHEN THE SUN WAS 4 DEGREES HIGH THE SAME WAS SCITUATED NEAR THE SECTION AND REMOTE FROM THE SOU THERN HORN 25 OF THE DIAMETER THE SUN BEING HIGH 6 DEG 10 MIN IT SEEMD TO HAVE BEEN PASSED THE CENTER AND THAT THE SECTION OF THE DISK DID CUT THE SAME THE SUN BEING 7 DEG HIGH IT APPEARED YET MORE ADVANCED NORTHWARD TOGETHER WITH TWO OBSCURE SPOTS SEATED BETWEEN THE SECTION AND THE CIRCUMFERENCE AND EQUALLY DISTANT FROM ONE ANOTHER AND FROM EACH HORN ON BOTH SIDES AND THE SKY BEING VERY CLEAR I OBSERVD THE MOTION OF THE BRIGHT PART FOR 1 18 HOUR WHICH THEN SEEMD TO BE EXACTLY MADE FROM SOUTH TO NORTH WITHOUT ANY SEN SIBLE INCLINATION EASTWARD OR WESTWARD MEANTIME I PERCEIVD IN THE MOTION OF THE DARK SPOTS SO GREAT A VARIATION THAT IT CAN NOT BE ADSCRIBED TO ANY REASON IN OPTICKS MAY 10 AND 13 BEFORE SUNRISING I SAW STILL THE BRIGHT PART NEAR THE CENTER NORTHWARD LASTLY JUNE 5 AND 6 BEFORE THE RISING OF THE SUN I SAW THE SAME BETWEEN THE NORTHERN HORN AND THE CENTER OF THIS PLANET AND I NOTED THE SAME IRREGULAR VARIATION IN THE OBSCURE SPOTS BUT WHEN VENUS BEGAN TO BE FURTHER REMOVED FROM THE EARTH IT WAS MORE DIFFICULT TO OBSERVE THESE PHAENOMENA I SHALL NOT PRESUME TO DECLARE MY SENTIMENT TOUCHING THESE APPARENCES SO BOLDLY AS I DID CONCERNING THE SPOTS FORMER LY DISCOVERD IN JUPITER AND MARS FOR THOSE SPOTS I COULD VERY WELL OBSERVE FOR A WHOLE NIGHT TOGETHER DURING THE OP POSITION OF THOSE PLANETS TO THE SUN I COULD CONSIDER THEIR MOTION FOR THE SPACE OF SEVERAL HOURS AND AT LAST SEEING THEM RETURN REGULARLY TO THE SAME PLACE I COULD JUDGE WHE THER THEY WERE THE SAME SPOTS OR NOT AND IN HOW MUCH TIME THEY617 THEY ABSOLVD THEIR RELATION BUT IT WAS NOT SO HERE WITH THE APPARENCES IN VENUS FOR ONE SEES THEM BUT FOR SO SMALL A TIME THAT IT IS FAR MORE DIFFICULT CERTAINLY TO KNOW WHEN THEY RETURN TO THE SAME PLACE YET THIS I CAN SAY SUPPOSING THAT THIS BRIGHT PART OF VENUS WHICH I HAVE OBSERVD ESPECIALLY THIS YEAR 1667 HATH ALWAYS BEEN THE SAME THAT IN LESS THAN ONE DAY IT ABSOLVES ITS MOTION WHETHER OF REVOLUTION OR LIBRATION SO AS IN NEAR 23 HOURS IT RE TURNS ABOUT THE SAME HOUR TO THE SAME SCITUATION IN THIS PLANET WHICH YET HAPPENS NOT WITHOUT SOME IRREGULARITY NOW TO AF FIRM SUPPOSING IT TO BE ALWAYS THE SAME BRIGHT PART WHETHER THIS MOTION IS MADE BY AN ENTIRE REVOLUTION OR BY A LIBRATION I DARE NOT YET DO IN REGARD I COULD NOT SEE THE CONTINUITY OF THE MOTION THROUGH A GREAT PART OF THE ARCH AS I DID IN THE OTHER PLANETS AND FOR THIS VERY REASON THAT WILL ALWAYS BE DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE

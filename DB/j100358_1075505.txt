j100358,The School Review,1075505,Editorial Notes,i244577,EDITORIAL NOTES GEORGE HERBERT LOCKE It is with great pleasure that we welcome still another of the admirable reports of that indefatigable and everinteresting investigator Mr M E Sadler This time his concern is with the opportunities for secondary educa REGARD 70 tion in Hampshire and we are reproducing his comments upon 8ECONDARY the function of secondary education in general that our readers EDUCATION FROM may get his point of view It is this feature of enunciating MR 8ADLERS LATEST REPORT principles that makes his reports literature instead of mere com pilations of facts and analyses of local situations It will be agreed that the most valuable results of secondary education do not consist in masses of book learning or in the possession of certificates it being only too easy to give people more knowledge than they can digest as well as the wrong kind of knowledge for their needs but in alertness and openness of mind in clearness of thought in the power of getting to the bottom of things of drawing right conclusions from facts and of grappling with difficulties in a practical and persevering way in ability to work with other people in firmness of moral principle in courage reverence and selfcontrol The merits of a school there fore should be measured not merely by the success of its pupils in examinations but by their general intelligence by their bearing by their sense of duty by their conduct when school days are over by their public spirit and by their habit of steady and thorough work To secure these benefits the essential thing to pro vide is a staff of teachers of high personal character and of cultivated mind So far as the course of studies is concerned it should not be prematurely specialized A general training on liberal lines is the best preparation for technical education and most likely to give the necessary power of selfadaptation to new and unfore seen conditions in the practical duties of adult life But the spirit of the education matters more than its form and the attitude of mind which it produces is more important than the amountof actual knowledge which it provides In point of curriculum secondary education should not be all of one type Different tem peraments and different types of mind have a natural affinity for different courses of study On the intellectual side the chief business of a secondary school is to secure a wide and discriminating outlook to make the learner quick to see the bearing of one thing on another and to train in him the power of concentrating his thoughts upon the work in hand The tone and tradition of the school the personal example and the influence of its teachers and the corporate life of the scholars are of no less importance 567568 THE SCHOOL REVIEW than the actual course of its studies But through the medium of a course of studies a school has necessarily to do the greater part of its intellectual and char acterforming work Therefore the right choice of a course of studies is a matter of great moment in educational policy But it is also owing to the vast range and variety of knowledge now available for the purpose a matter of extreme difficulty upon which there is at present great conflict of opinion among those best qualified to judge We are compelled to regard the whole question as being through the operation of intellectual and social forces which lie beyond individual control to some extent once more in an experimental stage Nevertheless in spite of our uncertainty on many points touching the curriculum of schools the forces of the time make it necessary to act In this and in other countries there is an unmistakable demand for new educational opportunities This demand springs from many causes The rise of a new and highly skilled artisan class has led to a desire for a more advanced kind of education than is at present usu ally given in the public elementary schools This is probably the most signifi cant feature in the new educational situation with which we have to deal A type of school is needed which will carry forward and supplement the work of the elementary school This development is often asked for under the name of secondary education Again there is a strong feeling that the elementary schools should themselves be improved the training made more individual and the classes smaller This has led to the need of more teachers and involves better provision being made for their educational and professional training In the third place modern business life in nearly all its forms makes greater demands than here tofore on the intellectual powers and therefore necessitates a better intellectual training in the case of those who are destined for posts of responsibility in indus trial and commercial life Fourthly the range of professional life has widened The secondary schools have to consider the needs not only of the older learned professions including the profession of the teacher but of a number of other callings such as accountancy public administration and the municipal service which are now as exacting in their intellectual demands And lastly there is a growing conviction that the civil welfare of the whole community calls for a widening of the intellectual outlook by means of well directed school training The chief difficulty in the way of developing intellectual keenness in our secondary schools lies in the temper of the time Many of the old aims which were implicit in educational work are passing through a phase of readjustment to changed social needs Secondary education is especially sensitive to psycho logical conditions and feels the influence of the uncertainties which arise in a period of rapid intellectual and social transition The new learning of our time has not yet found its fit form as an instrument of instruction for the generality of pupils in the secondary schools Patience is needed and the securing of men who will devote great intellectual power with strong moral purpose to the problem of what to teach in our English secondary schools and how best to teach it A good deal of the actual instruction as distinct from the corporate training given in many of our English secondary schools at the present time is of muchEDITORIAL NOTES 569 less value than it might be to many of those who receive it There are indeed many honorable and some brilliant exceptions to this and there is no reason whatever to feel disheartened for the future Everywhere there are signs of a new spirit in English secondary education Moreover in their hold upon char acter and in their regard for the personal welfare of their pupils our good English secondary schools are unrivaled in the world But much of what is actually taught in the way of lessons has often too little relation to the real needs of life There is apt to be too much working up for examinations and too much of the certificatewinning kind of training There is often too much reliance upon text books too close a following of the beaten and dusty way Too often the lessons are in no real sense the outcome of the teachers own intellectual life and con sequently they fail to arouse any intellectual interests or to engender a belief in the power of knowledge among those to whom they are given But it must never be forgotten under what disheartening difficulties great nrumbers of the teachers have to carry on their work Their intellectual life is often choked by poverty stunted by lack of opportunity of travel or further study deadened sometimes by years of drudgery prolonged into disappointed middle age And teachers can do but little unless their work is carried forward by some great intellectual or national movement of which it is the expression and from which it derives its power of appeal and its spiritual force It is just that in the reorganization which is now going forward in English secondary and higher education a movement which has had no real counterpart in our national history care should be taken to secure for countrybred children access to those opportunities for advanced education which are afforded by effi cient secondary schools The possession of a good education counts for more and more in the organization of modern life It is highly undesirable therefore that intelligent parents should feel that by living in the country they are endangering the intellectual welfare of their children Hence in the foregoing chapters of this report the needs of country children have been carefully kept in mind and suggestions have been made for meeting them by the provision i of efficient secondary or higher elementary schools at convenient centers throughout the country 2 of allowances to coverthe cost of railway fares in the case of Junior County Scholars who though at some distance from a secondary school live within daily reach of one and 3 of a number of boarding scholarships for children of special promise who live too far away from a secondary school to pass to and from their homes every day In view of the number of useful careers now open to women it is proposed that these facilities should be placed within the reach of girls as well as boys Modern business of all kinds whether it be carried on in town or country causes an everincreasing demand for the power of organization The power of organization if it is to be effectively used under modern conditions requires not only persistent application and accuracy in details but a wide range of knowledge and the trained use of the imagination It also involves the habit of applying knowledge to practical ends of bringing together different portions of knowledge570 THE SCHOOL REVIEW into new combinations and of quickly realizing the bearing of new developments of knowledge upon customary ways of doing things and upon the probable demand for new kinds of skilled service These qualities are capable of culture by means of appropriate school training It is part of the business of a good school and especially of a secondary school to cultivate them And thus an efficient system of secondary and higher education can supply the very kind of power which modern business relationships require Schools cannot actually create the power but they can develop or cultivate it and greatly increase its value The power is needed in the country as well as in the towns and in some respects the need for it in the country is the more pressing It is to the interest of the whole nation that this power wherever it is found should be developed to the utmost Second ary and higher education must therefore be looked upon as a matter of public concern and not as a luxury which can be left to take its chance without public help or supervision

some years since descended himself into those Mines to the depth of 200 Fa thoms and was led about in them for the space of three hours THE Mines of SalGemme in Poland a mile distant from Cracovia near the small Town of Wilizka which the Church excepted is altogether digged hollow under ground2000 ground hath Eight descents of which the two chief being in the Town it self are those through which the Salt is drawn up the other two do serve for letting down Tim ber and other necessaries These descents or holes are five square four or five foot long and as broad lined downwards thorough with Timber Above is a great Wheel with a strong rope of the thickness of a lusty arm drawn about by a Horse like in a Horsmill He that will descend must cover himself with a Frock and have another man that fastens another rope to the a foresaid big rope and having so tyed it about himself as to sit in it takes one in his lap and holds him fast about whereupon the big rope being let somewhat down ano ther fastens likewise a piece of rope to the other thick rope and does like the former seating himself in it and taking and clasping another man in his lap and being also let down a little way gives place to others to do the like in which manner thirty fourty and more persons may be let down all at once of whom the first having toucht the ground steps out and goes aside the rest following him and doing the like And thus they descend to the depth of 100 Fathoms But then they take a Lamp and lead people about by strange passages and Meanders still more and more descending till they come to certain Ladders by which they go down an 100 Fathoms deeper where there are double passages and holes one above another in a abun dance for the Minemen dig on still and cut out every where and on all sides as long as the Saltvein lasteth and Salt is found but the Vein being lost and no more Salt appearing in one place they search for other Saltveins whence come so many holes and passages out of one into another The great holes to secure both the Town a boveand the work below from falling in are very care fully filled out and supported by strong and wellcompa cted Timber of which there is enough in those Works to build a big Town with Out of these Mines they dig and cut out three sorts of Salt one is common course and black the second some what2001 what finer and whiter the third very white and clear like Chrystal The course and black Salt is cut out in great pieces roundish and three Polonian Ells long and one Ell thick which costs fifty to seventy Polonian Florins Mean time the inhabitants of Cracow have a priviledge whereby a certain number of pieces is to be deliverd to them eight such Florins the piece The great pieces lye at Cracow about the Streets before the doors of the Citi zens as also in the Country in the small Towns and Vil lages and before the Forts and houses of the Nobility Where the Cattel passing to and fro lick of those Salt stones which afterwards by Mills and other Engines are grownd and beaten small for use The Colour of these Saltstones is Darkish gray with some mixture of Yellow The Instruments wherewith they are diggd and cut out have almost all German names with Polonian terminations for when this Saltwork was first found which is now above four hundred years ago the Minemen that first began to work in it were Ger mans whence the Poles have retaind those names of the Tools but given them Polish terminations These Saltworks belong to the King of Poland who appoints and maintains the Officers of them and tis one of his best Royal Revenues amounting to considerable sums of moneys There is no less than a thousand men that are constantly employed in these Mines and there was then a provision of Salt valued at two Millions There are in these Works three Horses that stay always below having their Stable and other necessaries there they carry the Salt from the Places where tis cut and diggd out to those whence tis by the abovementiond Wheel and Ropes drawn up by a Horse above ground going round about The Horses after they have been a while underground grow blind from the sharpness of the Salt and all the three which then laboured there were quite blind and one of them that had been longest in those Mines had the hoofs of his feet grown as long again as they are usually so that each hoof was near a span long This2002 This Saltwork hath also beneath it certain Saltsprings whence the Saltwater is by Channels conveyed to several places where tis boyled to Salt But there is yet another Mineral Saltwork in Poland viz at Bochna but not so well orderd as the former Besides there are divers other places in Poland and in Russia also which yield Salt as at Holitz Colomeja Solum Pintz Oswentz c In the Podolian desert near the Ri ver Boristhenes is a Saltlake whose water is by the heat of the Sun wasted and turnd to Salt so that the people there ride into it with Horses and Waggons like unto Ice and cut it into pieces and carry it away as the Polish Historian Cromerus at large relateth who also affirms that in the aforesaid Saltwork at Bochna they find a Frozen sub stance which by them is called Carbuncle used by the peo ple to purge their Bodies by grating and drinking it in a convenient vehicle

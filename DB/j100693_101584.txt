WITH TIMBER ABOVE IS A GREAT WHEEL WITH A STRONG ROPE OF THE THICKNESS OF A LUSTY ARM DRAWN ABOUT BY A HORSE LIKE IN A HORSMILL HE THAT WILL DESCEND MUST COVER HIMSELF WITH A FROCK AND HAVE ANOTHER MAN THAT FASTENS ANOTHER ROPE TO THE A FORESAID BIG ROPE AND HAVING SO TYED IT ABOUT HIMSELF AS TO SIT IN IT TAKES ONE IN HIS LAP AND HOLDS HIM FAST ABOUT WHEREUPON THE BIG ROPE BEING LET SOMEWHAT

TIS BY THE ABOVEMENTIOND WHEEL AND ROPES DRAWN UP BY A HORSE ABOVE GROUND GOING ROUND ABOUT THE HORSES AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN A WHILE UNDERGROUND GROW BLIND FROM THE SHARPNESS OF THE SALT AND ALL THE THREE WHICH THEN LABOURED THERE WERE QUITE BLIND AND ONE OF THEM THAT HAD BEEN LONGEST IN THOSE MINES HAD THE HOOFS OF HIS FEET GROWN AS LONG AGAIN AS THEY ARE USUALLY SO THAT EACH HOOF WAS NEAR A

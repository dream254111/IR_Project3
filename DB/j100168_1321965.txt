and belong ing to another road are part of the ways works and machinery  of the railroad within the meaning of a statute similar to the English Employers Liability Act Bowers v Connecticut River R R Co 38 N E Rep 5o8 Mass While this case turns upon the construction of a statute yet it is interesting because of the prevalence of statutes of this kind A different construction was given the statute on facts which are hardly distinguishable in Coffee v R R Co 155 Mass 2I where it was held that empty cars belonging to another company and being returled to that company by the defendant were not part of  the ways works and machinery  of the defendant The point is now settled in Massachusetts in accordance with the principal case by St I893 c 359 which expressly provides that any car in the use of or in the possessioni of a railroad company shall be considered a part of its ways works and machinery AGENCY  PAROL AUTHORITY  A Statute of Illinois provides that city councils should allow street railroads to be built only when the landowners petition for such railroad There was a petition in this case and the city council granted permission to the defendanit railway company to build a line Plainitiff I1ow seeks to enjoin the buildinig of it oni the ground that the names of some of the landowners were signed by agents as appears on the face of the petition and that the authority does not appear The theory was that the authority had to be in writing Held a parol authority to signi was good and injunction will not be granted Tibbets v Westand Southz Towns St Ry Co 38 N E Rep 664 Ill In Illinois an authority to sell or lease lands must be in writing and the argument of the counsel for plaintiff was that practically land was sold here so the petition could be signed only by the owner or an agent authorized by writing The court answered that there was nothing in the statute changing the commonlaw rule by which an agent may sign the name of his principal to a writing under an authority not in writ ing They said the fee of the street belonged to the city of Chicago and that the petitions did not operate as a grant anyway AGENCY  RATIFICATION BY PRINCIPAL NONEXISTING AT DATF OF CONTRACT  One of the promoters of defendant corporation contracted with plaintiff on behalf of358 HARVARD LAW REVIEW defendant to pay plaintiff Iooo 0for services to be rendered the corporation The contract was entered into before the corporation had come into existence The pro moter afterwards became president of the corporation and ratified the contract it beilng within the scope of his authority to make or ratify contracts of this nature Held that such ratificationi made the contract binding upon defendant Gray and Fitch JJ dis senting Oakes v Cattarazgus Wazter Co 38 N E Rep 46I N V This decision entirely disregards the established rule of law that acts done on behalf of a nonexisting principal cannot afterwards be ratified by that principal The minor ity however stand by the doctrine Technically the established rule cannot be gain said for the ratification relating back to the time whein there was no principal seems an absurdity But practically it has often beeni necessary for the courts to look behinid the corporation and at the stockholders and it would not require such a very great stretch to do so in this case The body of men who form the corporation are in existence at the date of the contract and are acting in order to bind themselves only under another name that is the name of the corporation Is it not better then to say that the court in a case of this kind will look behind the corporate entity and at the real principals thus avoiding techniical rules effectuating the intention of the parties and bringing about more substantial justice  See I Morawetz Private Corporations  547549 BILLS AND NOTES  PROMISSORY NOTE  GARNISIMFNT  The maker of a note agreed to pay a certain commission if the note was not paid at maturity and was col lected by an attorney The maker was garnished in an action against the payee and while the garnishmenit was still pending the note fell due Immediately after the makers discharge consequent upon the dismissal of the suit against the payee he paid the principal and interest Held that these facts were no defence in this action to recover the commission for nonpaymenit of the note at maturity Brahan v The First Nat Bank of Clarksville I6 So Rep 203 Miss It is settled in Mississippi by the cases of Work v Glaskins 33 Miss 539 and Smith v BEazk 6o Miss 69 that a garnishee is liable for initerest accruing pendente lite and that to avoid such liability he must pay the money into court The court decide this case on the same principle and hold that if defendant wished to escape liability for these commissions he should have paid the notes as they fell due into court suggest inig the fact of their negotiation if known to him CARRIERS  RIGHT TO STOPOVER PRIVILEGES ON AN UNLIMITED TICKET  Plain tiff purchased an unlimited ticket from S to A and upon givinig it up demanded from the conductor a stopover check as he wished to leave the train at 0 an intermediate station This was refused him but he alighted at 0 and resuming his journey on the same day by a subsequent train was ejected for refusal to pay his fare Held under  490 of the civil code of California allowing the purchaser of a railway ticket to ride from the station at which the ticket was botught to the station of destination  and from any intermediate station to the station of destination the plaintiff has a right to stop off at any intermediate station and resume his journey without payment of additional fare Robinson v S P Ry 38 Pac Rep 94 Cal It is perfectly well settled that by the common law the purchaser of a railwav ticket has no such privilege as Js allowed by the decision in this case Whatever rights a ticket conifers are exhausted when the passenger is received on the train His ticket is used as soon as the train starts anid may be thereafter demanded and cancelled Auer bach v Ry 89 N Y 281 Evans v Ay I I Mo Ap 463 The performance oni the part of the railway to which the passenger is entitled is a unity and an unbroken series of authorities deny his right to force upon it the burden of carrying him from place to place between intermediate stations on a single ticket covering the whole distance travelled Cheney v Ry II Met I21 Vankirk v Ry 76 Pa St 66 Wymanl v Ry 34 Minn 210 Roberts v Koehler 30 Fed Rep 94 Cody v Ry 4 Sawy 114 It would seem that if the legislature of California had intended to make such a sweeping change as is involved in endowing all tickets with stopover privileges they would have used more explicit language Such however under the decision of the court is the effect of the section in question whatever the intention may have been when it was enacted CONSTITUTIONAL LAW  DESCENT AND DISTRIBUTION COLLATERAL INHERI TANCE TAX While the tax imposed by St 1891 c 425 on inheritances is in form a tax on property in effect it is an excise on the privilege of transmitting property in this way This privilege is a taxable commodity within the meaning of the Constitu tion anid an excise laid upon it is not unreasonable and void because certaill estates are exempt nor because kindred in the direct line are relieved from payment AMinot et al v Winthrop etal 38 N E Rep

represenitations a Statute of Min nesota required every venidor of nursery stocks grown outside the State to file an affidavit give bond and comply with other restrictive regulations none of which

the court is simply following Welton v Missouri g9 U S 275 and Cook v PennsylIvania 97 U S 566 and earlier cases to the effect that the power of Congress over the tranisportationi of a commodity conitiniues until the commodity has ceased to be the subject of discriminatinlg legislation by reason of its foreigni character but the second ground of the decision may be questionied as the statute apparenitly made no discrimination betweell the citi zens of Minnesota anid those of other States and the only explanation would seem to be that the court believed its position would be justified by the practical effect of such legislation CONSTITUTIONAL LAW  OBJECTS OF TAXATION  JUDICIAL QUESTION  In satisfaction of a claim by the relator againist a township for a certaini sum paid over to his successor in office by mistake the legislature enacted that the respondent shotild levy upon the taxable property in said towniship for the purpose of refunding the said sum with interest In error upon the award of a writ of mandamus to compel tlle levy it was heldi that the enactmnent was conistitutionial if supported by a sufficielnt moral or legal obligation but when the facts out of which

defendants in June I882 to purchase timberlanids for them He was to receive for his services a certaini percentage of the profits arising from the sale of the lanlds after deducting the amount of the taxes and initerest The defendants expressly reserved the right of de termining the timne and terms of the sale Plaintiff purchased accordilngly In August I883 defendants refused an offer for the lands which would have netted them a return of 300 per cent Plaintiff demanded his share of the profits based upon such offer but was refused and action was brought the verdict being in his favor On error Knowles J held that notwithstanding the express reservation the colntract was not to be so construed as to leave it to the option of the defendants whether or not a sale should ever take place In such contract as the present the law requires that a reasonable time for the sale be fixed and that a reasonable price be decided upon If the party havinig the discretion fails to conform to these requirements he becomes liable Nunez v Dautel 19 Wall 56o which cites Hicks v Shouse 17 B Mon 487 anid Ubsdecl v Cunnizgham 22 Mo 124 The learned juLdge seemed to think that the price offered had been

the judgment Gilbert J dissentinig thought that the defendants were under no obligation to accept the offer He admitted that the plaintiff might brinig action if the lands remained unsold after a reasonable time or if the profits had been ascertained as by accounting or admission but thought that nothing of the kind had occurred The two members of the court differing the verdict stood The learned juidges seem to differ rather as to the constructioni to be placed upon the facts than in their views of the principle involved Noyes v Barnard 63 Fed Rep 782 CONTRACTS  RESTRAINT OF TRADE

Nordenfelt v MaximAVordeVfelt Co L R I894 5 App Cas 535 48360 HARVARD LAW REVIEW The English law has been steadily tending of late years toward the abandonment of the old rule that every covenant not to engage in a particular trade was void if unlim ited as to space Pollock on Contracts p 315 This case definitely discards the old rule and lays down as the test of validity What is a reasonable restraint with refer ence to the particular case  The opinions of the judges are interesting because they show clearly the gradual development of the law as to such contracts and the steadily increasing tendency toward the result now finally determined upon by the House of Lords See NOTES CORPORATIONS  ULTRA VIRES AcTs  Held that the alienation by a corporation of a pipeline in which a

charged with the crime of murder or assault with intent to commit murder a person extradited oni the clharge of  assault with intent to commit murder  cannot be convicted of an assault with intent to do great bodily harm People ex rdel Young v StOut 30 N Y Supp 898 It was urged that a man could be extradited for one offence and convicted of another minor offence included within the one for which he was extradited In this case however the prisoner could not have been extradited at all for the minor offence of assault with intent to commit great bodily harm The court say that to allow a conviction for the minor offence under these circumstances would be a breach of faith and a violation of the treaty between Great Britain and the United States by which extraditioii for the major offence was made possible The precise question raised here is thought to be rather a novel one CRIMINAL LAWHOMICIDEINSANITY IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE Instruc tions held correct that if defendant by reason of insanity was rendered incapable of distinguishing right from wrong as applied to his act or if by reason of an insane de lusion he was deprived of his willpower and was compelled by an irresistible impulse to do the act then he is excused Wilcox v State 28 S W Rep 312 Tenn This it is submitted is the correct view Parsons v State 8i Ala 577 The de cisions in this country are in conflict as to whether an irresistible impulse will excuse from crime when defendant knew the difference between right and wrong Beales Cases on Criminal Law 254 Note on the Test of Insanity But if the impulse was really irresistible and was caused by a diseased state of mind there seems to be no good reason why defendant should be held responsible even though he knew right from wrong when he was unable to choose between right and wrong See contra 2 HARVARD LAW REVIEW 387 CRIMINAL LAWHOMICIDESELFDEFENCEThe defendant knowing that his life had been threatened armed himself and went where deceased was Held

EVIDENCE  JUDICIAL NOTICE  Testimony was given that a crime was committed in Monitean County three miles from California Held this is evidence that the crime was committed in Missouri for the court will take judicial notice that Moniteau County is one of the counties of Missouri and that California is a town in Moniteau Cotunty State v Penningon1 27 S W Rep Iio6 Mo In this country if a place is

Snitza v Flournoys Admr 47 Ala 345 at 367 Ala Gold Life Its Co v Cobb 57 Ala 457 But where the place is not withini their jurisdiction the courts have declined to take judicial notice that the place referred to is one place of the name rather than aniother Andrews v Hoxie S Tex 171  RNgin v Collier 6 Mo 568 These latter two cases follow the English case of Aeaztnev v king 2 B  Ald 30r See also Brune v 7hompson 2 Q B 789 In Kearney v King supra it was held that the court could not take judicial notice that a bill headed Dublin May i i86 was drawn in Dublin Irelaiid because there may be otther Dublins in the world lhe same reason might be applied where the place in question is within the jurisdiction of the court but as the subject of juLdicial notice is not at all technical and as it lies within the discretion of the court to take it or not and as it is not final if a party gives evidence thlat some other place is meant there is ample justification for the above distinction Of course the colurts will more readily take judicial notice that a certain place is meanit if there are other circumstaiices indi cating that fact as there usually are when the place is within their own jurisdiction PARTNERSHIP ATTACHMENT AND SERVICE A partnership havinig a usual place of business in Ohio and formed for the purpose of carrying on business there con sisted entirely of nonresident partners In an action against it Held a that since the partnership as such had no separate existence its property could be attached as that of the partners under the Ohlio law allowing attachment of the property of non residents b that a writ made out in the firm name served on the firm as such at its usual place of business was good Byers v Schzlpe 38 N E Rep 117 Ohio It would seem that the general reasons for allowing more stringent process against noniresidents do not apply to a firm doinig business within the State havinlg all its assets there and as the second holding shows fully amenable to service The second holding is based upon  50oi Rev Stat of Ohio which provides that a partnership may sue or be sued by the ordinary name which it has assumed and in such case it shall not be necessary to allege or prove the names of the individual members thereof The statute is so complete a recognition by the legislature of the separate existence of the firm that it jars unpleasantly with the refusal of the court to recognize anytlhing of the sort PARTNERSHIP INFANCY OF PARTNER  JUDGMENT AGAINST FIRM  Held that in a suit against a firm of which one of the partners was an infant judgmenit should be rendered against the firm  other than the infanit  and that bankruptcy proceedings should also be taken against the firm  other than the infant Lovell and Christmas v Beauchamp L R 1894 5 App Cas 607 This case treats the partniership as an entity to a certain extent and gives judgment against it as such thus making the firm assets pay the firm debts though one of the partners is an infant This is reachinig the right result in the right way In contrast with this case is Whittitnore v Elliott 7 flun 5i8 There the right result was reached in the wrong way Juidgmenlt was rendered against the adult members of the firm only but executioni was allowed to be taken out on all the firm property To prevent great injustice the common law had to give way somewhere anid the court rather than discard the commonlaw theory of a partnership allowed exectutioln to be taken out which did not follow the judgment but was against the property of those against whom no judgment had been renidered The result in the principal case was made possible by the English statute allowing partnerships to sue and be sued in the firm name and this now seems the only way to get rid of the commonlaw notion of a partnership and make it what it is really treated as being by merchants and partners themselves a legal entity PERSONS  BREACH OF PROMISE  FRAUD  As a defence to an action for breach of promise evidence was given that plaintiff had told defendant that she had obtained a divorce from her former husband but did niot mention the fact that he also had obtained a divorce from her onl the ground that she had a violent temper and had treated him with such cruelty that his health had been injured She told defendant also that she was a descendant of the finest white families in Charleston but omitted to state that her mother married a colored barber after the death of her first husband and that this negro was her reputed father Held that these facts constituted a good defence Van Houten v Morse 38 N E Rep 705 Mass The court expressly says that it is not the duty of a woman before accepting an offer of marriage to tell all the history of her family and herself butdecides the case on the ground that it was fraud for her to narrate part of such history and suppress the rest so that plaintiff was deceived as to the kind of woman he was promising to marry362 HARVARD LAW REVIEW The agreement to marry differs very often from other contracts in that it looks to the creation of a status  so in many instances the ordinary rules of contracts cannot be applied Whenever it is possible to apply them however without doing great injustice they should be and in this case we find such an application to a state of facts rather novel Mr Bishop in his Marriage Divorce and Separation Vol II  224 says  Any conduct by one of the parties amounting to actual fraud will justify the other who has been entrapped by it in withdrawing from the agreement This general propositionl wheni applied to the facts of this case would seem to justify plaintiff in refusing to performn his contract as a partial statement of facts is often as deceptive as a misstatement PERSONSDIVORCECOLLITSION The respondent and corespondent com mitted adultery without the connivance of the husband The wife had some property and the petitioner desired to have this settled on their child after the life of the respondent He therefore agreed to bring suit for divorce aild ask for no damages if the wife would so settle the money The wife also deposited ioo to pay the costs of petitionier As a result of this agreement the suit was begun and a decree nisi obtained The Queens Proctor here intervenes on the ground of collusion In his opinion the learned President of the Probate c Division says  there was no collu sion to present to the court false facts in proof of adultery  and it was not shown that there were any specific facts material to defence or recrimination which might have been brought forward by the wife The question therefore came squarely before the court whether collusion means an agreement to deceive the court by putting in false matter or suppressing material matter or whether an agreement merely as to the prosecution of the suit and costs was collusion The court held that collusion is to have the broader meaning and that there was collusion in this case So the Queens Proctor was entitled to succeed Churchward v Churchward and Holliday II The Times Law Rep 69 The English authorities are very carefully dealt with by Sir Francis Jeune who comes to the conclusion that there are two or three cases in point Lloyd v Lloyd I Swab  T 567 is very like the present case the only difference being that there an agreement as to the procurement of evidence existed In the principal case the matter is discussed on theory very ably The learnied President says  He petitioner appears before the court in the character of an injutred husband asking relief from an intolerable wrong but if at the same time he is subjecting his rights to pecuniary stipulation he raises more than a doubt whether in the words of Lord Stowell he has received a real injury and bonafide seeks relief Mr Bishop arrives at the same result 2 Bish Mar and Div  28 a PERSONSUSE OF WIFES SEPARATE ESTATELIABILITY OF HUSBAND Where a wife allowed her husband to take legacies to her separate use and spend them in the support of the family without any understanding whether they were a gift or a loan held that she might recover the amount taken Owing to the peculiar relation of husband and wife the inference arising from a tranisfer of her separate property to him is that a trust was intended The onus is on the party wishing to prove a gift Ham mond v Bledsoe 38 N E Rep 530 Ind The court distinguishes betweeni a use of the principal and of the income of the sepa rate estate saying that in the latter case the court will presume a gift This distinction runs through the books appearing at least as early as 2 P Wms 82 The reason for it seems to be that originally the principal of the separate estate was in the hands of a trustee who might be the husband and he might dispose of the property without his wifes knowledge so that it would have been unjust to presume that she conselnted as to the income however she knew when it became due and if she quietly allowed her husband to keep it her consent might fairly be presumed The reason for this distinction is past A married woman may hold property at law as in the principal case she may take actual possession of it if after that she hand any of it over to her husband whether principal or interest may not the courts fairly presume that she intended to make a gift PROPERTY  EQuITY  CANCELLATION OF A DEED  Where a grantor delivers a deed to the grantee without consideration on the uniderstanding that no title is to pass until certain security is given in return Held there is no valid delivery of the deed and the grantor may obtain cancellation of the deed at any time before such security is given Rountree v Smith 38 N E Rep 68o Ill The fundamental assumption upon which this case is decided is erroneous if the decision is correctly reported The exact words of the decree are not given but the idea of a conditional delivery in escrow to a grantee is opposed to the whole spirit of the law The authorities upon which the Illinois court rely for this peculiar decisionRECENT CASES 363 are all to the effect that delivery is necessary to the validity of a deed from which premise they conclude that there may be a delivery conditioned on the return of security that as this was not done the title never passed from the grantor Henice the deeds were merely a cloud on the title and should properly be canicelled by decree of a court of equity There is unidoubtedly a remedy by decree in such a juncture  but it is not found in assimilating the procedure where real property is involved to that ill vogue in cases of written contracts These may be delivered up and cancelled But it would seem that the proper decree in the principal case would be to reconvev or that the grantee furnish such security as had been agreed between the parties PROPERTY  EXCEPTION IN GRANT  FUTURE ESTATE  W H M conveyed lands to one H The deed conitainied the following clause  Reserving unto said W H M anld E M M a life lease of said abovedescribed premises for and during the life of each of them The question was what interest E M M plainltiff who was the daughter of W H acquired by this clause she being a straniger to the deed Held a  reservation  in favor of a stranger to the instrument is invalid as a reserva tioni yet in order to effectuate the intention of the grantor such a reservation has uniformly been treated as  exceptinig  from the grant the thinig reserved The lan giiage here used must be treated as exceptinig from the grant the use c of the lanid coniveyed during the lives of both father anid daughter anid at the death of the father the right to that use for the uneexpired portion of the period must be held to have descended to the heirs of W H M of whom the petitioner is oie Martin v Cook 6o N W Rep 679 Mich The purpose of the clause in this deed is clearly to create a future estate in fee That such estate could nlot be created by a commonlaw conveyance is of course clear on account of the impossibility of livery of seisin This difficulty however may be overcom by treating this coniveyance as a bargain and sale exectuted by the Statute of Uses 2 HIow Ann Stat chap 214  5565 inasnmuch as there appears to have be n a conisideration paid sufficient to raise a use A good case on this poinit is Rogers v Eale Fire Company 9 Wend 6i i The court in the prinlcipal case do not discuss this lpoint at all though it seems the only grounid oni which the desired result canl be attained The court devote most of the opinion to deciding that technical words of reservation will not prevenit the clause from being treated as aln exception if such appears to have been the initention of the parties It would seem that this is perfectly settled on principle and authority In support of the proposition that this has nlot beeen confined to cases where the reservationi had beeni previously carved out the court cite several cases of such exceltions they refer mostly however to persolnalty and for this reason do not seem precisely in point as there is no difficulty about creating future estates ill personal property The decision is sound but should be

the appoilntment thereby made was made  subject to the power of revocation and new appointment men tionied in the settlement After the death of the wife the husband executed a deed revoking the joint appointment and makiing a new appointment of the fund Held that the husband andwife had power in their joint appointment to reserve a power of revocation and new appointmenit to the survivor and that such power was effectualy reserved in the joint appointment In Re Harding L R 1894 3 Ch D 315 This is a question of construction and the court follow the rule laid down by Lord Keniyoni in Brudenell v Elves I East 442 Lord St Leonards states it as follows  If a particular power is given to two persons or the survivor of them with or withotLt power of revocation they may execute ajoint appointment and reserve a power to the survivor to revoke and appoinit again The argumenit against the validity of the power of revocation to the survivor was that the original power did not authorize a joint appointment to be defeated by any but a joint revocation But the joint apointment is allowed to be superseded by the revocation of the survivor Sugden on Powers 8th ed 364  6 PUBLIC SCHOOLS  SECTARIAN

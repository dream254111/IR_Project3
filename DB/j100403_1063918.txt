CITY ORDI NANCEIt has long been an established principal of law that a man could not be twice put in jeopardy for the same offense Un der the ancient common law however the plea of former jeopardy was allowed for different reasons and afforded a much broader protection to the offender than is the case under modern law It was first allowed in felony cases only and then because of the pe culiar manner of punishing felons at common law Under ancient criminal jurisprudence felonies were punishable by a total forfeiture of the offenders goods and a corruption of his blood It was early held in England that a person being thus attainted might plead the same in bar to a subsequent prosecution for any other felony whatsoever whether committed before or after the first convic tion for upon his once being attainted his entire possessions were forfeited his blood corrupted and he became dead in law and any further conviction or attainder would be fruitless1 This broad plea however was never received with favor even in England and consequently by judicial exceptions the rule became estab lished that the plea of former jeopardy was not admissible except where a second trial would be wholly superfluous Thus where the criminal was indicted for treason after an attainder of felony in which case the punishment would be more severe it was held that the former attainder would not prevent the second prosecution This holding prevailed in England until the passage of a statute 1 17 Am Dec 791 noteNOTES allowing the plea of former jeopardy only to second prosecutions for the same offense2 The principle discussed above has never been generally accepted by the American authorities but it is a fundamental principle of our law guaranteed by constitutional provisions that a conviction or an acquittal of a crime is a bar to any subsequent prosecution based upon the whole or any part of the same offense4 The doctrine of former jeopardy is often stated as a prohibition upon bringing a person a second time in jeopardy of life or limb 5 but the principle is a general one and prevents a second jeopardy in cases of all crimes whether felonies or misdemeanors6 To con stitute jeopardy the same offense must be twice dealt with pe nally and punishing the wrongdoer after he has been sued civilly for the same act is not double jeopardy As to when jeopardy be gins in a prosecution for a crime the authorities are not agreed but the better opinion seems to be that jeopardy does not arise un til after the jury is properly sworn to make due deliverance of the case7 Once it arises however no matter how short the time the trial must proceed to a legal termination otherwise the accused will be forever discharged of the criminal accusation against him and he cannot thereafter be indicted for the same offense8 It is held by the weight of authority that a prosecution for a lesser offense bars a subsequent prosecution for a greater offense in all cases where the lesser offense is a necessary and integral part of the greater and vice versa9 This seems to be sound upon principle because where a person is put in jeopardy for part and subsequently for the whole of a single crime it is plainly double jeopardy as to the part By a single act two distinct offenses may be committed against the same jurisdiction as in the case of a single sale of liquor without a license and to a minor where the law of the place of sale makes it a criminal offense to sell without a license and also a criminal offense to sell to a minor Here two distinct offenses are committed and a prosecution for one will constitute no bar to a prosecution for the other The doctrine of double jeopardy protects only against a second prosecution for the same offense and not a double prosecution for the same act constituting separate offenses10 2 Act of Parliament 7  8 Geo IV 3 There seems to be at least one court which has recognized the doc trine Crenshaw v State 1 M  Y Tenn 122 17 Am Dec 788 State v

S W 262 487VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW Again the same act may constitute an offense against two ju risdictions and in such case jeopardy in one is no bar to a prose cution in the other Thus the same act may be an offense against the United States and at the same time against one of the states and may be punished by both11 This seems sound upon reason and principle because the act violates the law of two separate and dis tinct sovereignties neither of which can forbid the other from pun ishing for a violation of its own law Nor can the offender complain because he has by the violation of the laws of both sovereignties committed an offense punishable by each This principle has been extended by some courts which hold that if the same act violates both a general state statute and a city ordinance both the state and the municipality may prosecute for the offense Thus in the recent case of Shreveport v Nejin La 73 South 313 the defendant was convicted under a state statute for selling liquor and it was held that such prosecution by the state did not bar a subsequent prosecution for the same act under a municipal ordinance Where a municipal ordinance pro hibits acts which are also penal offenses under the state law con siderable difficulty arises Unlike the case of the United States and the state discussed above the municipality is an agent or arm of the state government and has no powers except those granted it by the state Since a municipality is but the creature of a state it follows that no city ordinance can stand which is in conflict with a state statute nor can a city ordinance prohibiting acts which are also penal offenses under the state statute suspend or super sede the state statute But it is generally accepted that ordinances are constitutional and stand even though they cover the same crimes which are penal offenses under the state law both laws being equally in force at the same time and place12 The question still remains however Can an offender who by a single act vio lates both the state law and municipal ordinance be prosecuted therefor by both the state and the municipality It is believed that he cannot and that the act is punishable alone by that power which first takes jurisdiction13 If the municipality first takes jurisdic tion and prosecutes for the crime it is in reality the state punishing through its agent and for the state itself to later prosecute for the same crime would constitute double jeopardy The same thing holds true where the state first prosecutes it cannot later prose cute through its agent the municipality An interesting question arises in this connection Suppose that a state statute and a municipal ordinance cover the same crime but the ordinance makes the act a less serious offense than the state statute Will a prosecution under the city ordinance bar a sub sequent prosecution under the state statute The answer to this question should afford no difficulty and the statement that only n Commonwealth v Barry 116 Mass 1 COOLEY CONST LIM 6 ed p 239 3 Lynch v Cohn Ky 35 S W 264 488NOTES the first power that takes jurisdiction should punish seems to be true in this case when the purpose of the state statute is considered The general purport of the state statute is to protect the citizens of the state against the particular wrongful acts To a munici pality is delegated the power of prescribing by ordinance what acts committed within its jurisdictional limits shall constitute of fenses against the peace of its citizens and to punish such offenses that the people of that locality may protect themselves against the injuries of wrongdoers The ordinances passed by a munici pality in pursuance of this power are usually adapted to meet the peculiar needs of that locality It is seen therefore that the pur poses of the state law and of the municipal ordinance are identical Though it might be said that the violation of a state law is an injury to all its citizens yet the immediate injury falls upon the people of that locality in which the offense is committed and it would seem that the act done would be primarily in violation of the local ordinance A prosecution under it would satisfy the needs of the local citizens and should therefore satisfy the de mands of the state This same manner of reasoning would apply in the reverse case where the city ordinance makes the act a more serious offense than the state statute covering the same crime It is argued by some authorities that the single act constitutes two offenses one purely local against the police regulations of the municipality the other a violation of the state law14 And from this is often drawn an analogy to the concurrent jurisdiction of the state and federal courts15 This analogy however is unsound because the municipality is not a distinct sovereignty its only power emanating solely from the state It is believed a more sat isfactory reason for allowing a dual prosecution would be that the constitutional prohibitions against double jeopardy were never intended to apply to convictions under a mere police regulation16 And this view would seem to find support in those cases which permit conviction for the violation of the ordinance by summary proceedings where if the act were punished as a violation of the statute an indictment and jury trial would be necessary17 Another doctrine advanced to support these decisions is that the prosecution under the ordinance is a civil and not really a crim inal proceeding Such a view is not wholly without reason Where as at common law the enforcement of the ordinance is by an ac tion of debt for the fine brought in the name of the city the ac tion is admittedly civil8 But where the proceeding is in the na ture of a complaint the character of the action is much disputed The cases necessarily turn largely upon the particular wording of Mayor v Allaire 14 Ala 400 15 See State v Ambrose 6 Ind 351  State v Clifford 45 La Ann 980 1 Ogden v Madison 111 Wis 413 87 N W 568 Mclnery v Denver 17 Colo 302 12 DILLON MUN CORP  634 489VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW the state constitution and statutes19 In general it seems to be held that if the violation of the ordinance is also a misdemeanor by the statute or the common law the proceeding is criminal otherwise it is civil20 It is believed that this distinction is un sound The character of the violation of a city ordinance is not altered by the criminality or noncriminality of the act under the statutes The true test would seem to rest in the intention of the legislature in authorizing and of the city in passing such regula tions This is to be ascertained from the nature of the act pro hibited the penalty imposed and the method of procedure Where the purpose of the ordinance is to render reparation to the city by a fine the proceeding even though by complaint may well be considered civil as distinguished from criminal On the other hand if the object is to punish the offender it would seem that the proceeding to collect the fine unless it be an action of debt and clearly the proceeding to impose a penalty of imprisonment would be criminal in character The doctrine therefore that pro ceedings for violations of municipal ordinances are civil in char acter would seem to be too broad EXHIBITION OF INFANT AS EVIDENCE IN BASTARDY PROCEEDINGS An examination of the many decisions dealing with the pro priety of exhibiting an infant as evidence in bastardy proceedings reveals hopeless confusion among the courts of last resort From the apparently irreconcilable conflict of opinions three doctrines may be extracted that furnish the fundamental basis for various modifications and exceptions to be noted hereafter The first of these doctrines holds that an inference of paternity from resemblance is one upon which a jury may reasonably act when both parties have been subject to their direct observation Probative value is assumed without reference to the age or ma turity of the spurious offspring and the principle finds its justi fication in the theory that evidence should not be rejected merely on the ground that its bearing is not of a given degree of certainty1 In these cases the illusory nature of the resemblance is considered as rather imposing a duty on the court in conjunction with the weight to be given such proof than as militating against the rele vancy of the inquiry and in several cases an extension of the same doctrine has permitted such resemblance to be established by the testimony of witnesses without actual exhibition of the child in court2 As a practical issue the admissibility of such evidence in this latter instance may well be questioned and is denied by 19 See 33 L R A 33 note 0 State v Milwaukee 89 WVis 358 Killy v

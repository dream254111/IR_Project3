Surgeon RN HMS Bristol Communicated by GEORGE BUSK FRS Received May 3 1870 Besides its obvious bearing on the longvexed and still ulnsettled question of the unity of the human species and on the closely related one of accli matization the present inquiry is of great medical importance Tropical pathology whether of native or foreign races calnnot be fairly studied until we thoroughly know its physiology nor cani we recognize and properly estimate disturbed action of organs till we understand their healthy func tions Otherwise niatural phenomena may be mistaken for symptomns of sickness Many socalled tropical diseases are merely exaggerations of the ordinary effects of climate physiological merged into pathological pheno meiia a knowledge of the one is the first step to an accurate acquaintance with and philosophical method of treating or preventing the other No inconisiderable part of our present knowledge of the vital phenomena514 Dr Rattray on the effects of Change of Climate June 16 induced in the humani economy in passing from cold to warm regions or the reverse is derived from experiments carried out in artificially made or seldom encountered climates By hotair chambers we illustrate the effects of augmented temperature on the respiration pulse c and by the rarefied atmosphere of mountaintopsshow how diminished density acts Neither of these however are fair examples of natural climates Thus the former dry and warm is unlike the tropics with its triple combination of increased heat rarefied air and excessive moisture as the latter dry and chilly is dissimilar from the usual surfaceclimates of extratropical latitudes which conjoin cold condensation and moisture The dry and warm or dry and cold climates which occur in nature are usually local and limited Nor do such abrupt and temporary exposures to heat and cold have any parallel in ordinary life or are they likely to induce results similar to the comparativelv slow transition involved in an ordinary change of climate and though the rarefied air of heated chambers will decrease while that of great altitudes will accelerate respiration the former will do so less and the latter more than they otherwise would from the skin and especially the more slowly acting liver and kidneys being unable at once to increase their action so as to aid the lungs in eliminating carbon The functional changes so induced cannot tlherefore be taken as a fair criterion of what occurs in nature anid as mere approximates to truth such observations though in teresting are evidently wanting in practical importance I The Influence of Tropical Climates on the Respiration It has been ascertained by the experiments already alluded to that the respirations are diminished in frequency in warm and increased in cold air but we do not yet know what happens in the tropics where great heat rarity of air anid moisture are conjoined Nor has it yet been shown whether the quantity of air respired is greater in the tropics or less It is obviously necessary to ascertain both before we cani decide whether the total quiantity of air and oxygen respired and the amount of carbonic acid and watery vapour exhaled be different or not Tlhe following experiment will show that the capacity of the chest for air is miaterially affected by tropical climates1870 on the Human Economy 515 TABLE ITo show the effect of tropical weather

average gain of 24 cubic inches per man Column 3 gives the capacity thirtyeight days later in the equatorial doldrums and highest temperature of the return voyage 830 F shade and shows that in ten of the twelve cases this increase was still fuirther augmented by an average of 6 cuibic inches from prolonged tropical exposure It would be interesting to know the limits of this increase and whether it is as likely permanent The otlher two cases remained stationary The total average in the twelve cases during this fifty days residence in the tropics was 31 cubic inches 12 24 per cent In orderto test whether this was due to climatic causes or resulted from custom in using the instrument the same cases were again tested about three weeks afterwards oni return to England in September when it was found column 4 that the capacity of the cnest for air had again decreased in every case by an average of 26 cubic inches Although the temperatures were identical 65 F shade on quitting and returning to England the time was apparently too short to allow the capacity of the lungs to resume their first standard average of 256 cubic inches being still at 260 cubic inches Bult this result followed a subsequent reduction of temperature to 420 F shade in February 1870 when the average capacity of eleven of the same cases was found to be 253 cubic inches that is 3 cubic inches below the first trial This fact however goes far to prove that there is a limit to this reduction in the pneumatic capacity of the chest in health which was probably nearly reached The results among the other adults were identical and showed that the capacity of the chest for air is con siderably greater in the tropics than in temperate climates This was noticeable in five of the six cadets During the three weeks of the return voyage between the tropics and England when from faulty diet their growth was nearly or altogether stopped the capacity of the chest decreased con siderably when it might have been reasoniably expected that the dimilnished capacity from climatic causes would have been more than counterbalanced by expansion from growth usually very rapid at that age This actually occurred in the sixth Lees a tall growing youth in whom an increase of 27 cubic inches showed that his chest had enlarged considerably The greatest increase in the pneumatic capacity of the chest from this sojourn in the tropics of the twentyfour cases here recorded amounted to 39 cubic inches and the lowest to 21 This and the subsequent experiments were made at sea and in equable superoceanic temperatures  It will be interesting to kniow whether the same laws prevail in insular littoral and especially conltinental climates possessing a higher day lower night and greater diurnial anid annual range of the

was evidently too brief and the disease not sufficiently active in any of these cases for this to have resulted from the formation or increase of cavities in the lnngs and it can only be ascribed to the law that the pneumatic capacity of the chest varies with temperature increasing in tropical and diminishing in temperate and cold climates A knowledge of this law is evidently of practical application in prevent ing mistakes in the spirometric diagnosis of certairn lungdiseases Thus the capacity of the chest of anl individual debilitated by residence in the tropics and weakchested but

in winter labouring under catarrb with the pneumatic capacity of his chest reduced by from 25 to 35 cubic inches On the other hand a patient actually in incipient phthisis might be erro neously considered to have permanently recovered by a trip to the tropics having raised the capacity of his lungs for air by a similar amount i e al most or actually up to the normal standard for his age and height in a temperate climate A similar mistake might be made especially if the instrunment is carelessly used in the same climate e g that of England at different seasons of the year such as the height of summer and depth of winter when a considerable difference in the capacity of the lungs for air must not be taken as an index of disease  The greater the range between the summer and winter temperatures the more marked will be the differ ence in the spirometric indications But it is not by deep inspirations like these that ordinarv respiration is carried on and it is important to ascertain whether the air inspired in each ordinary breath undergoes a similar increase and decrease according to climate The difficulty in limiting and measuring the small quantity of air expired during our usuml faint breathings makes thi5s a far more delicate and difficult experiment than the preceding From analogy however we may infer that it does vary and the following will go far to prove it  My ordinary respirations ranged from 4 to 8 and averaged 6 cubic inches in a temperature of 440 F shade during the winter of England At Lisbon during an average temperature of 65 F shade they ranged from 5 to 13 and averaged 9 cubic inchest Unfortunately while in the tropics I had not the proper apparatus to ascertain how muclh they increase during the far greater temperature of equatorial regions As these results therefore only prove the existence of an increase and do niot show its extent it will be necessary as it is doubtless correct to calculate the minor from the major increase The following Table will show the negative effect of period of tlle day on the capacitv of the chest for air in the tropics TABLE IVThe capacity of the chest for air as influenced by period of the day

evening both in the tropics generally aind in its warmest part the equatorial doldrums are so very nearly identical that we may conclude that period of the day has very little influence on the capacity of the chest for air or the power of taking deep inispirationis Closely allied to the foregoing is the influence of tropical climates on the frequency of the respirations In heated airchambers respiration becomes less in man Vierordt and Ludwig also found that the respira tions are lessened in number in animals subjected to heatt Does this occur in natLLral tropical climates  We might infer that as the volume inspired increases so does the number of respirations But fact Table V proves the reverse and shows that as in hot artificial climates they are diminished in number

the average had incsreased to 16k and at freezingpoint 32 F to 17 With those results similar experiments carried out at my request by a colleague coincided and showed that though as in temperate latitudes the activity of the respiration differs in different individuals they are diminished in number in the tropics Thus while his respirations averaged 16077 per minute in the temperate climate of Englancl January average temperature 320 to 440 F they average  Parkes Practical Hygiene  Hooper  Physicians Vade Mecum c t Parkes ibid  Mr T El Kniott Assistanturgeon520 Dr Rattray on the effects

in England and 162 in the West Indies The same may be noticed in an artificial climate of a heated room in England Thus while my respirations out of doors in a tempera ture of 300 F were 17 5 per minute they rose to 158 shortly afterwards by simply standing before a fire in a temperature of 570 F From these data we find that the increased quantity of air and oxygen inspired in the tropics does not make ujp for the diminished number of respirations in supplying the same amount of air and oxygen for blood purification as in cold climates though doubtless a requisite quantity is inspired less probably being needed there as will presently appear to carry on the vital processes Thus taking the average number of respi rations in the temperate climate of England at 17 Table V and the quantity of air inspired each breath at 15 cubic inches this would give 255 cubic inches per mninute Now if the chest Table I gains in capacity by an average of 31 cubic inches 1224 per cent in the tropics the gain on each ordinary respiration would be 1P836 cubic inch thus raising the quantity inspired each breath to 16836 cubic inches The average number of respirations being taken at 14 this would give

the grand total difference in favour of a temperate climate after deducting the real decrease in volume and correcting for ex pansion by heat By again reducing the 9243 oz of carbon by 3614 per cent or 033409 oz we get 8909 oz as the total amount which the lungs throw off in the tropics the difference between the tropical andcl extratropical quantities being 11028 oz This result in the human species accords with Vierordts observation on the lower animals viz that less carbonic acid and presumably less water are eliminated when they are subjected to heat This then is probably the rule but in ex ceptional cases from idiosyncrasy accelerated or forced respiration may make the quantity of carboni which the lungs can exhale in temperate and tropical regions more nearly alike Thus the relative proportions of carbon thrown off by the several depu rating organs in the tropics differs from those of temperate latitudes Ioopert gives the latter as lungs 10k oz skin  oz faeces 2 oz urine 2 oz total 1 13 oz we have found that in the tropics the amount eliminated by the lungs is reduced by 1 oz Under judicious hygienic and especially dietetic management that for the skin liver and urine may not be materially altered from these figures but otherwise it is probably on the skin that the greatest share of its burden is thrown We may presume that the liverwork and bile are increased though perhaps only slightly in the tropics although this has not yet been actually proved The kidneys may assist to a greater extent for though the urine is diminished in quantity in the tropics the relative amount of solids is not correspond ingly altered Much of the latter mav be carbon for though the urea eliminated by the kidneys in the tropics is diminished the qua tity of uric acid which contains thrice the amount of carbon has not yet been ascertained The mutual bearing of these two closely related but very opposite re sults viz an increase in the capacity of the chest for air in the tropics with a decrease in the number of the respirations is an itnteresting if not important study Iasty inference might lead us to attempt to explain the former by a greater volunie of the rarefied and moistureladen air of the tropics being required to supply the system with the requisite quantity of oxygen But there are several objections to this theory e g 1 Nature might do this in health as she often does in disease such as phthisis pneumonia c by increasing the frequency of the respirations  Parkes  Practical Hygiene 2nid edit t Physicians Vade Mecurn I Parkes  Practical Hygiene 2nd edit p 448522 Dr lattray on thle effects of Change of Climate June 16 whereas here they are diminished in number To increase the one and diminish the other the first implying augmented and the second decreased energy in the respiratory muscles implies an anomnaly which it is un necessary to accept when the phenomena can be otherwise and better explained 2 External mneasurement mnoreover shows that there is actual increase in the capacity of the chest from its expansion by increased action by its inspiratory muscles Thus in three adults in which the chest was mea sured by the spirometer and tape in the winter of England average tem perature 3032 F and aoain at Lisbon average temperature 600 F though in all three there was a decided increase in the capacity of the lungs for air to an average of 11 cubic inbches there was no perceptible increase in the circulmference of the chest In one case the latter had apparently decreased by one inch as if from loss of muscular tone 3 It is more than doubtful if the svstem actually requires an increased quantity of air or as much oxygen to carry on the vital processes in the tropics as in cold climates and the abovementioned data prove that it actually gets less of both Less oxygeni is required in the high tempera tures of low latitudes because the tissues genierally decay less rapidly Owing to diminished mental and bodily exertion of the two which make up the bulk of the body viz the muscular and nervous less is required for the metamorphosis of waste particles WZJhere a diminished necessity and desire for food lessen the ingesta and jutdicious selection reduces the amount of carbon this contains less oxygen is requiired for direct combina tion with the elements of the food to generate heat Moreover it is certain that the increased absorption of oxygen by the functionally excited skin in the tropics where it acts vicariously for the lungs as a respiratory organ lessens materially the amount required by the lungs Furthermore the skin is aided in relievinrg the lungs in the decarbonizing process by the functionally excited liver and perhaps kidneys which throw off the carbon in forms which do not require much oxygen for their formation viz as bile and uric acid The true explanation appears to be that there is really no actual in crease in the capacity or size of tbe chest and elnclosed lungs but only an alteration in the relative proportion of blood and air contained in the lattert  Carpenter and others doubt this and believe Ithat they decay miore rapidly in other words that whon usecl thore is a greater waste for the same amount of work The stun total of this however for all the tissines will probably Rot be greater than the reduction dlue to the diminished amounLt of work which tlhe priincipal tissues hlavo to perform t With regard to the observation tihat thie increasecl capacity for air in the chest is only an alteration in the relative proportion of blood and air in the lungs there must be a reservation macie irn favour of a statement tlhough it still perhaps has to be proved that tlhe bases of the lungs have a reserved capacity for air any enlarge ment of which would of coturse have to be mlleasured not by expansion of the costal walls but by protuberalco of the abdomen through encroachment on its cavity by1870 on the Ihuman Economy 523 The bulk of thle lungs remaining the same in the tropics as in colder lati tudes or being eveu somewhat diminished from their comparative abeyanice as excreting and beatgenerating organs the blood diverted to the func tionally excited and congested skin and liver permits the ingress of a larger quantity of air into the pulmonary aircells and tubes whereas in colder latitudes this is reversed the lungs being more and the skin and liver less active the blood drawn from the latter to the former dimi nishes the calibre of the airvesicles and bronichi lessening the quantity of contained air as happens to a still greater extent in some lungdiseases e g bronchitis pneumonia pulmonary congestion  and phthisis tu bercle and not blood being in the latter the displacing agent Briefly the lulngs identical in size in both contain less blood and more air in tropical than in temperate climates The truth of the above explanation appears to be confirmed by facts noticeable in Table I viz that it is in thoroughly warm tropical regions where the skin acts most freely and the senisible perspiration is most abundant that the greatest difference is observable in the capacity of the lungs for air Thus the difference between the capacity near the equator temp 83 F and September in England temp 65 F was 26 cubic inches while between the latter and the winter of England Februarv temp 420 F wben the fuinctions of the skin were much more in abeyance was no more than six cubic inches Anld it corresponds with what Dr Francis Bengal Army t has observed viz that the lungs are lighter after death in Europeans in India than the European standard Parkes has made the same observation and remarks that it shows appa rently a diminished respiratory function A knowledge of this law in addition to its diagniostic value is evidently of considerable therapeutic importance as furnishinig a guide to the rational treatment of many and especially congestive or inflammatory diseases of the lungs By its facts the true rationale of the benefit derived in the earlier stages of phthisis or where it is merely immiinent from a sojourn in a subtropical climate is of easy explanation Residence in a warm atmosphere is followed by a decrease in the quantity of blood in the affected luns by diminished activity in the vital processes carried on therein by facilitated respiration and above all by diminished lungwork from vica rious action of the physiologically excited skin and liver  while the in lialation of milder more equable and less irritant air diminishes the chances of excitemenit or increase of distressinm local inflammation and lescent of theo diaphragmn  ancd the exceptional case above related of diminution of the costal circumlference may po3sibly be explained by the diaphragm counteracting the other respiratory muscles whilst unusually contracting in answer to tho room required bv this reservedl power of thle bases of the lungs being called into action  See anl admirable letter on  Swimmers Cramp in the  Lancet for October 9 I 869 p 531 by may friend Mr Hleniry Hales of Reigate who first suggested to me a satisfactory explanation of the above phenomena t Parkes  Practical lTygiene 2nd edit p 463524 Dr Rattray on the effects of Change of Climate June 16 those bronchial attacks so apt to break up old and canse the deposition of new tubercle Might we not wisely imitate this oftener than we now do in practice  The increased pneumatic capacity of the chest indicates a decrease in the quantity or bulk of blood in the lungs equivalent to the increase in the quantity of air If for example the latter is increased by 30 cubic inches this implies a permanent withdrawal of 1662 ounces of blood from the lungs to the skin and liver Now if we can imitate Natures operations and by increasing the temperature of a sickroom or ward in this the temperate climate of England can convert it into a local subtro pical or tropical climate we withdraw no inconsiderable amount of blood from the lungs to the skin and liver thus relieving its overburdened capil laries permitting freer access of air and so aiding the respiratory process a safe and sure mode both of relieving dyspncea and cough and aiding the vis medicatria In tropical hygiene the law appears equally suggestive Is not the de crease in the quantity of carbon which the lunigs can throw off by 14 oz an indication of the necessity for regulating the diet both as to quantity and kind and especially of making it less carbonaceous When this is attended to anc for other reasons already alluded to the quantity of oxygen taken in by the lungs is sufficient to enable them to throw off their allotted portion of carbon Even when the diet is unaltered the function allv excited and vicariouisly acting skin liver and perhaps kidneys may be able to eliminate surplus carbon up to the abovementioned amount and perhaps a little beyond it But this doubtless has a certain and pro bably individually varying limit and from a prolonged and excessive ingestion of highly carbonaceous food in the tropics all three organs are apt to suffer from overwork as may also the lungs in endeavouring to aid them by accelerated and perhaps forced respirations The importance of keeping the lungs the great carboneliminator in all climates and the skin one of the chief in the tropics in a state of the most perfect functional activity possible especially in the tropics will be equally apparent as will also in disease of any one of them the indication with regard to the rest  and considering the great importance of the skin in acting vicari oLsly for the lungs as an eliminator both of carbonic acid and water the necessity for constantly keeping it in healthy action during disease of the latter organis especially phthisis will appear imperative The following Table will show the relation of the frequency of the respi rations to the period of the day in the tropics18703 on the thuman Economy

as in colder latitudes In the former the lungs play a less active part as a heatgenerator and eliminator of carbonic acid and water Hence the respiration is calmer and more equable Thus in the tropics there is orily one respiration and a fraction more in the evening while in the temperate zone there is 1 nearly Had the season been winter instead of summer anid the weather colder the difference would have been greater II The Injfluence of Tropical Climates on the Pulse Like the previously detailed experiments on the respiration the present were made during a voyage from England lat 510 N to Bahia lat 1 P S and back i e across the equator and extend over 60 days 53 in the tropics and 7 in the latitude of England during which the thermo meter ranged from 570 to 840 F 270 F The observations were taken thrice a day in the standinig posture Table YII shows that as in tempe rate latitudes the highest pulse of the day in the tropics occurs though by no means invariably in the morning TABLE

June 16 The following Table shows first that the average pulse for the tropics 87O  is lower by 2k beats than that for the temperate zone 90 indicating a more languid circulation seconid that the same holds good for the average morning and evening pulse third that the average afternoon pulse is higher in the tropics than in temperate latitudes probably from solar heat greatest at that period of the day fourth that the highest and lowest pulse of the period occurs in the morning fifth that the morning pulse has the greatest and the evening the lowest range TABLE VIIHTo contrast the tropical and

 875 901 The reduction of the pulse in the tropics is doubtless related to the diminished respiratory function and further observation may prove what the latter fact suggests viz that the pulse is diminished not only in fre quency but in force The rise in the pulse towards afternoon and its subsequent fall are doubtless physiologically connected with a correspond ilng rise and fall in the temperature of the body at the same periods Table IX The relation however does not extend to the volume or number of the respirations the former being nearly alike during these three periods of the day anid the latter greatest towards night As these observations however on the most excitable of all organs the pulse were made on one individual only and at sea where motion of the ship weather c render it impossible to ensure day by day the identical conditions necessary to give completely satisfactory results their confirmationi is necessary TIT The Ianguence of Tropical Climates on the Temperature of the Body In this inquiry so intimately connected with the two previous ones viz the respiration and circulation the facts were ascertained by placing an ordinary Fahrenheit thermometer under the tongue thrice a day during the same voyage as last the temperature of the air in the shade on the verge of the tropics being 720 F at the equator 84 F and the average of the tropics generally 769 and the atmospheric humidity represented by a difference between the wet and dry bulbs of a Masons hygrometer of 00 to 7k0 the average being 308 F  Parkes  Practical Hygiene avers that the pulse is quicker in the tropies though perhaps not so full In animals moderate heat does not but great heat does quicken the pulse The latter however is evidently an uina tural temperature1870 on thie Human Economy 527 The followinig Table contrasts the average heat of the body in the tropics and in temperate climates Thus while in England during a summer and almost stibtropical temperatuire ranging from 60 to 70 F the average temperature of the body was 980 3 F it rose in the tropics to 986 and in the equatorial doldruns to 990 F The difference would have been greater had the season in England been winter or the latitude higher From column 3 it appears that the temperature of the body in the tropics is greatest during the afternoon when the sun is high and the body most active and least in the morningan interesting fact in connexion with the pulse likewise highest and lowest then TABLE IXTo contrast the bodily temperature in tropical and extra tropical latitudes Temperate

effects of Change of Climate yc June 16 tropics with the temperature of the air and probably the activity of the body and brain both greatest in the afternoon and again decrease with these towards evening The highest temperature 1000 occurred at 3 PM the most oppressive part of the day in the equatorial calms where the air was most stagnant humid and hot 810 to 84 F with no breeze to cool by carrying off the surface heat and facilitating evaporationl Their source could not be dietetic as little food was taken between 8 AM anid 6 PM and there was no rise after the latter hour For the same reason it could not be the result of local muscular activity The totals show that 990 was the most frequent temperattire and next to it 98 0 while 99 0 and 1000 form no less than 22 per cent of the whole Is not the blood itself likewise somewhat warmer in tropical than in extratropical latitudes  The range of the temperature of the body in health is thus about 20 F John Davy gives it as from 5 to 1 F Eydaux and Brown Sequard at from 10 to to 210 and 30 F The superoceanic atmosphere in which the present observations were made is never so highly saturated as to completely stop evaporation from the cutaneous surface otherwise the temperature of the latter would rise much higher Blagden and Fordyce bore a temperature of 260 in the dry air of a heated oven the temperature of their skin rising 22 F only but when the air of the heated oven is so moist as to hinder evaporation the temperature of the body rises rapidly Ludwig says as mnuch as 70 or 80 F and Oberrnier confirms this t Observations on this point are still wanted with regard to continental littoral and insular equatorial climates both dry and humid The following Table which shows the relation of the temperature of the body to that of the external air in the shade indicates a gradual though trivial increase in the temperature of the former with that of the tempera ture of the latter proving that the one is slightly influenced by the other Thus at first it was 980 F then 983 98 6 9863 98 8 99 08 succes sively as the temperature of the air rose from 570 F to 84 F the ave rage for the warmest part of the temperate zone being 983 and for the tropics somewhat more viz 98836 The Table further shows that 980 F is the prevalent temperature of the body in the temperate zone as it oc curred in 24 out of 37 markings while in the tropics 990 F is the most requent and 985 and 990 nearly as frequent These results correspond closely with those of Dr Davy  Parkes  Practical Hygiene t As quoted by Carpenter

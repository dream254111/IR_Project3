animals whereas it was formerly estimated at three million monthly The decrease is due to budrot Much work has been done on this trouble in the British West Indies where the destruc tion of sick trees and the use of Bordeaux mixture as a preventive have given good results Considerable attention has also been given to the budrot by the United States Depart ment of Agriculture which at the request of the planters sent Mr Wmin Busck to Baracoa to investigate the disease in 1901 The measures which he recommended are sub stantially the same as those which are now to be carried out The results of his work are given in Bulletin No 38 Division of Ento mology UI S Department of Agriculture In the spring of 1904 Dr Erwin F Smith of the U S Department of Agriculture spent some time in Cuba studying the disease Mr Busck had regarded it as caused by a fungus Pestalozzia palmarum but Dr Smith re garded it as a bacterial rot The results of Dr Smiths work are given in ScIENcE N S Vol XXI No 535 p 500 March 31 1905 During the past year his investigations have been continued at Baracoa and other West Indian coconutproducing points The subject has been written on largely by Cuban authorities notable among whom is Dr Carlos de la Torre of the University of Havana and the Department of Vegetable Pathology of the Estacion Central Agro nomica de Cuba has given it as much atten tion as possible among many other problems during nearly four years but without being able thus far to reproduce the disease at will The work for which the appropriation has just been made by the Cuban government is in continuation of investigations undertaken by the Cuban Department of Agriculture through the Estacion Central Agron6mica in March 1907 At this time Mr Win T Horne chief of the Department of Vegetable Pathology of the Estaci6n Central Agro nomica was sent to Baracoa to study means of eradicating the disease and during the sum mer he made three other visits The trouble was found widely distributed and progressing at an alarming rate The principal work done was the treatment of several small groves with the most thorough sanitation possible i e dead and hopelessly sick trees were felled and burned while new eases and sus pected trees were flamed out In two of the groves which were treated the disease was passing across killing every tree in its path The work showed that all trees with fairly well developed cases die It was thought that some very early cases were saved by the flaming at least the disease was checked It was not stamped out in the groves but the results were as satisfactory as could have been expected in decreasing the infection The work now to be undertaken is prob ably the most extensive measure ever adopted to control the budrot of coconuts and it is most sincerely to be hoped that this aid from the general government will sufficiently sup press the disease so that by a vigorous system of inspections it may be thoroughly and per manently held in check SPECIAL ARTICLES REGARDING THE FUTURE OF THE GUANO INDUSTRY AND THE GUANOPRODUCING BIRDS OF PERU1 To the people of Peru the importance of the guano industry needs no emphasis but it is well first to make clear just what is the alarming condition with which the country is confronted and what is the object to be striven for Every one knows that the great ancient deposits of guano are now almost nonexistent As these deposits have been successively ex hausted of various high grades there is now left only the lowest grades that it is profitable to extract and also some supplies of such very low grade that under present conditions they are not marketable However the birds are 1 The present paper very slightly modified from a report recently submitted to the Peruvian gov ernment and published officially in Spanish is presented in English with the kind permission of Sr Larrabure y Correa Director de Fomento in Lima 58 SCIENCEJULY 10 1908 SCIENCE each year making new deposits especially on their nestinggrounds and this new fresh guano usually has a very high per cent of nitrogen and a comparatively low per cent of sand Now as the remaining deposits of old guano are rapidly being exhausted the annual gross output of guano is bound to decrease very considerably and the industry will be dependent entirely upon the yearly deposit of the birds Probably the general impression held in other countries regarding the accumulations of guano in Peru has been that they were comparable to coal formations in that they represented the very gradual accumulations of untold years and were practically speaking a finished formation By the very nature of such deposits they would surely be exhausted sooner or later Unfortunately this partly erroneous impression seems to have been the controlling one both in Peru and outside For while many of the intelligent men of intimate acquaintance with the islands have recognized the producing value of the modern birds the whole policy of extractors and the government has been until rather recently that of making the most of the old deposits with general disregard of the productive birds When one sees one thousand tons of new guano of the highest grade taken from an area of twelve thousand square meters where the birds have been nesting for much less than one year when one observes on a neighboring island an area five times greater completely covered with birds at their nests when one later finds this latter flock increased by nearly fifty per cent as the birds have been driven from other islandswith such convincing ap peals to the eye and the mind one will not fail to recognize the present producing value of the birds For this new guano of annual production there is on the one hand the insatiable de mand of the export trade and on the other a steadily growing requirement for the needs of national agriculture Since it is generally estimated that the agriculture of Peru re quires about forty thousand tons per year and since this quantity is surely more than the present yearly production it follows that the impression regarding the exhaustibility of the guano deposits may doubtless will prove true as far as the North American or European consumer is concerned More than this it is inevitable that with the continuance of the present conditions national agriculture will soon be forced against an actual and dis astrous shortage of this fertilizer The hope of the future lies then in the effort to make the annual deposits of guano greater in future years than it now is National agriculture may have an additional hope also that arrangements may be made with the exporting company whereby a greater proportion if not all of the fresh guano of high grade may be available for domestic use I THE AIM IN VIEW To realize the hope that the annual deposit will be greater in future years it is necessary to cease treating the birds as wild animals whose homes men may invade almost like beasts of prey to seize the useful product regardless of the producing birds Under a wiser policy the birds will be looked upon as domestic animals engaged in a useful labor and from which a greater benefit will be derived the more an intelligent consideration is shown for their welfare By the protective rmeasures there are three ends to gain 1 The present number of birds may be per mitted to spend a greater proportion of their time upon their chosen nestinggrounds so that a greater proportion of the guano may be available The most useful birds the  guanay  Phalacrocorax bougainvillei Less a cormorant and the alcatras Pelecanus MoUinae Gr a pelican spend a great part of their time during the entire year upon the nestingfield or neighboring grounds unless frightened away by the presence of men In this case they are likely to spend much more time upon the water or upon the small islets and cliffs where the deposits are less available if not largely lost 2 The present tendency to decrease in numbers may be checked There is a wealth of reliable testimony from the older men of 59N S VOL XXVIII No 706 long experience in the industry that the use ful birds especially the alcatras were for merly vastly more abundant than now Con sidering the wellknown facts regarding the robbery of eggs on a large scale in past years the destruction of young and old birds and the disturbance of the birds in their nesting grounds by the extraction of guano it is in conceivable indeed that the birds have not decreased greatly in numbers If they have endured the treatment they have received without decrease in numbers then protection can hardly be worth while On the other hand if it is true as represented by every one who should know that there has been a great diminution in number of birds then 3 We may hope that the protection of the birds will result in a great increase in their numbers Before the working for guano on a large scale began and before the nesting grounds began to be plundered for eggs and fowls the birds must have existed in a con dition of abundance dependent upon their food supply their enemies and their natural prolificness New factors have entered in recent years which have caused the birds to decrease materially below this normal condi tion of abundance If these unfavorable fac tors are removed by wellconsidered and well executed protective measures why may we not see an increase in number toward the former normal abundance I think it conservative to say that the proper protection of the birds means the saving to Peru of hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of guano each year The wise action of the government in keeping closed during last season the south island of the Chinchas probably saved one thousand tons or more of guano of high grade during this year Be sides it has been a benefit to the birds which if properly followed up will yield results in all successive years The keeping closed of the north island of the Chinchas would not have saved much guano during that season but as the beginning of a plan for the fostering of the alcatras it might have yielded results in future years For it seems sure that the alcatras was once an abundant and important bird in this region Now it has practically abandoned the region but as I showed in a report published in the Boletin del Minis terio de Fomento of June 1907 the few alcatrases which remain had chosen this one island of all in the Chincha and Ballestas groups for their nestingground The islands of Lobos de Afuera were abandoned for two years and the alcatrases settled themselves chiefly in the northern part of the eastward island and on an islet near by Here now was an ideal arrangement while the extrac tion of guano on a large scale was in opera tion in the Lobos de Tierra Islands these timid birds were in undisturbed possession of the Lobos de Afuera Unfortunately this condition was not permitted to continue for last season the extraction of guano was re sumed on these islands and the birds were entirely routed They have now taken new positions more or less scattered but with an especial aggregation on the northern part of the westward island Now guano is again to be extracted from these islands and the peli cans will be routed again from their newly established homes Is it not time to awaken to the fact that the alcatras is gradually dis appearing  The three instances cited above are adduced to illustrate this point we need not merely look out for the next two years but may well plan for protective measures that are in tended to work progressively to the advantage of the industry for the next twenty years or more We want to see many more birds in 1915 than are present in 1908 and more birds in 1920 than in 1915 and this will not be accomplished by routing the birds from their nestinggrounds as soon as they are fairly established II ONE CONTRACTOR TO AN ISLAND As illustrating the effect of admitting more thian one concessionist to an island let us take the 1Ballestas Islands as worked in 1907 for example As directed by the government I visited these islands in May and June and again at the end of July In the last part of May the work of extraction had been in operation but a few weeks and practically no guano had been shipped yet every inch of 60 SCIENCEJULY 10 1908 SCIENCE nestingground on all three islands had been dug up and thrown into piles while every bird had been routed It was perfectly evi dent that the work of extraction had been carried on entirely without regard to the preservation of the useful birds I do not mean by this that there was much wanton destruction of the birds but that practically no consideration was given to the necessities of these fowls for the completing of the rear ing of their young or for the mating and other preparations for the next season of re production No inducement was offered to the birds to continue nesting upon the same islands A little more forethought and sys tem in the manner of working might have saved many tons of guano for the season which is now beginning Now this reckless mode of treating the birds will be continued as long as more than one contractor is licensed to work on the same ground It is easy to picture the be ginning of the work Two or more contract ors have concessions for certain quantities of guano on the north island of the Ballestas There is on the southwest corner of the island a deposit of several hundred tons of fresh guano Naturally this place is the goal of each concessionist The first to arrive or the strongest as the case may be devotes every effort to the digging up of this area of high grade guano since by the act of heaping it in piles his claim is established and no other contractor has the right subsequently to touch these piles Of course this area of new fresh guano is the chosen breeding ground of the birds and so the entire floclk of birds young and old is routed uncere moniously from the land of their recent nests As just the same policy is pursued simultane ously on each of the other two islands of the group it results that within the first few weeks of the open season every producing bird on the Ballestas Islands is driven from its nest From the testimony of eyewitnesses it ap pears that a large number of young fowls were unprepared to abandon their nests and that the enforced removal of the birds did not occur without the loss of an important num ber of helpless creatures From personal ob servation I know that even as late as the middle of June there were large numbers of young birds on the south island of the Chin chas that were still being fed from mouth to mouth by the parents and I must therefore believe that the complete routing of the birds from the Ballestas two months earlier in April must have been very harmful We need not be too quick to blame the con tractors in this case Driven by the force of a very severe competition they try to estab lish their claims immediately to as much as possible of the best guano and in the heat and bitterness of the competition they grasp for guano while they are blinded to the wel fare of the birds If but a single concessionist is admitted to an island then a more systematic method of extraction may be followed and more con sideration be given to the needs of the birds It would be better still if only a single con cessionist were admitted to the group Fur thermore the government can require of the concessionist that an intelligent and com petent man be put in charge of the work of extraction who shall be held responsible for the fullest protection of the birds I may also refer to the fact that such a measure would eliminate those many and unfortunate disputes between contractors which as is notorious have been occurring in recent years on these islands and which reach to the point of threatened and even actual personal violence III CLOSING ISLANDS FOR PERIODS OF YEARS The plan of working all islands simultane ously condemns itself and a system of pro ceeding from one island to the next as soon as the guano from the first is exhausted is little better than the plan of working all islands simultaneously An improvement on this is the plan which has been suggested sev eral times recently of dividing the islands into two groups the islands of one group to be worked one year while those of the other remain closed This however on considera tion is seen to be inadequate since the birds would thus be disturbed each year as they are 61N S VOL XXVIII No 706 driven back and forth from the islands of one group to those of the other The merit of a system of rotation depends on leaving the birds unmolested for periods of years the longer the period the better For example it would be an incalculable gain if the alcatrases which are now using the westward island of the Lobos de Afuera could be left undisturbed on their grounds for the next four or five years say until the extraction of old guano from Lobos de Tierra is concluded Then in turn the latter island would be left to the birds for another period of five years whether the Lobos de Afuera was exhausted in one year or in four years In other parts of the coast according to the conditions certain islands would be opened each year but in accordance with a plan which would permit the birds to remain un disturbed for periods of years In stating that the main hope of the guano industry consists in leaving the fowls unmo lested for periods of years I speak from my own observations on the habits of the birds and on the disturbing effect caused by the presence of even a single visitor At the same time it is not a new idea and the intel ligent men of long experience in the industry will insist upon the same principle I wish to add this the idea of a systematic closure of islands if adopted must be followed reso lutely It may sometimes mean the suffering of national agriculture or of the export trade for want of necessary fertilizer but the suf fering should be accepted rather than break the protective measures It is fair to choose between two courses either to plan for the future of the guano industry adhering to reasonable protective measures even if pres ent sacrifice is necessary in order to reap the future benefit or else continually to cater to present wants and caprices and let the future look out for itself IV CLOSED SEASON It was a most wise action of the govern ment in establishing a closed season of five months November to March when all of the islands were worked each year Too much dependence however can be placed upon this measure With a proper system of rotation and closure of islands for years the closed season for the summer months becomes a matter of secondary importance There is no season of the year when the birds may be dis turbed without harm In the middle of June last year there were numbers of birds in the Chinchas Islands which were still being fed from mouth to mouth by their parents At the same time the process of pairing for the next season had begun and by July 29 hun dreds of eggs had been laid as the beginning of the next seasons brood of young During what months then could work have been conducted on this island without injurious molestation of the birds The fostering of the birds will be accomplished only by leaving them unmolested for the entire year and for several years in succession If an island is to be opened it is not of vital importance whether it be opened in April or in June I believe it to be more harmful to open too late than too early To illustrate this let us make an imaginary case of the south island of the Chinchas If it be possible to do with out this island it will be most beneficial if the island may remain closed until April or May 1909 Suppose that it is now decided to keep this island closed and that later about August it is found that the supply of guano from other sources is inadequate and the de mands of national agriculture are such that it is deemed necessary to extract guano from this island The island is opened early in Augustwith what result  Just at the stage when the majority of the birds have mated for the season when a large number of eggs are newly laid and when the females are laden with eggs ready to be deposited in the prepared nestsjust at this critical time the birds are frightened from the island The newlaid eggs are abandoned and other eggs laid during this time of change may be lost as the birds chance to stop upon the neighbor ing rocks or islands For the change of home is not accomplished in a day it requires many days or weeks for the birds to realize that the old home must be abandoned to settle them selves in a new place and to recover from the demoralization attending the forced change 62 SCIENCEJULY 10 1908 SCIENCE More harm is wrought than if the birds had been routed in April then by the beginning ofthe new season of laying they might have found themselves established in the new homes The case is imaginary but it leads to the following important conclusion Be fore deciding whether to open or close the south island of the Chinchas the Lobos de Afuera the Zarate the Isla Blanca or any one of many large and small which have birds in reproduction it should be carefully considered how much guano is required and from what places it may be obtained The determination of which islands should remain closed and which open can then be made in telligently and the islands opened at once or else kept finally and absolutely closed It is hardly necessary to refer to the fact that the condition of the sea in the winter months is much more unfavorable for the extraction of guano than in April or May The closed season serves a most useful pur pose but for the future the dependence must be placed on closure for periods of years and less emphasis may be laid on the matter of a month or two V TO PLACE THE EXTRACTION OF GUANO FOR NATIONAL AGRICULTURE IN THE HANDS OF A SINGLE COMPANY Such a measure as this I believe to be a part of the ultimate solution of the problem Saying this I have no reference to any spe cial arrangements which may be pending and with the terms of which I am unfamiliar In making arrangements with a company many subsidiary problems arise such as the effective protection of the birds the proper system of rotation of the islands the manner of conducting the work the proper distribu tion of the guano in case the supply does not equal the demand the analysis of the guano and the selling by units of nitrogen and of phosphoric acid the guarantee of an equitable price etc Undoubtedly these problems will be carefully studied out before any permanent contract with a company is entered into The merit of placing the guano extraction in the hands of a company depends upon making the contract last for a period of years say for ten years or more By this means the company is induced to plan for the future which is the desideratum It is likewise very desirable that some ad justment may be made with The Peruvian Corporation Limited with entire regard to all natural obligations but with a view to se curing a harmonious plan of working for the protection of the birds and also to enabling the national agriculture to get the best of the guano at a reasonable cost and with prices proportional to the value of the guano It is difficult to believe that two companies working in rivalry for the same guano will not work to the injury of the birds unless each be strictly limited as to territory or some way be found of harmonizing the rival interests for the benefit of the industry There are other important questions which need not be discussed here but which should be suggested for consideration A govern ment bureau for the analysis of guano might be established in order to give to the small agriculturist the same advantage which the larger haciendas now enjoy namely of buy ing the guano by analysis I have known cases of the adulteration of guano by sand for the simple reason that the guano so re duced in quality could be sold by the con tractor at the same price as a guano of higher grade The price to all farmers large or small should be directly proportional to the value of the guano in the fertilizing elements as shown by analysis The matter of having deposits of guano on shore has sometimes been suggested This might serve to expedite the extraction of guano on the islands so that they could earlier be abandoned to the birds even if the fertilizer could not be sold and delivered at once The shore deposits might be utilized to equalize the annual supply and they might serve as the basis for mixing sta tions should this prove practicable where guanos of any desired strength of phosphoric acid and nitrogen could be prepared and sup plied according to order CONCLUSION It is seen then that there are many ques tions which require to be carefully studied 63N S VOL XXVIII No 706 out If the best solution is not attainable then the second best may be adopted but it may be the earnest hope of all that after the fullest consideration of the matter all parties interested may be led to cooperate in the at tainment of a plan by which the interests of national agriculture may be safeguarded with out the sacrifice of any legitimate interest The problem before the government the national agriculture and the exporting com pany is this How can the guano industry be saved to the future Certainly no legiti mate interest can be furthered by a continu ance of the present unsatisfactory system with its sacrifice of the birds I think the solution of the problem will be furthered if we put the question in this way What system of regulation will result in the greatest annual deposit of guano twenty years hence NOTE Without attempting at this time precise figures the following considerations are sug gestive and not misleading If we take a cubic meter of guano as a ton then with an average thickness of 10 cm 4 inches an area 10 meters by 10 meters or 100 square meters would yield ten tons of guano and on 60000 square meters there would be 6000 tons A point of significance economically speaking is the commercial value of permitting the birds to make the deposit even one centimeter thicker during the year The flock of cormorants Phalacro corax bougainvillei which covered very close ly an area of 60000 square meters 15 acres and was the largest single aggregation of birds on the coast of Peru was seen on the south Chincha island last year It is easy to find that the nests average about three to the square meter giving a total of about 180000 nests Allowing four birds to the nest that is a pair of adults and a pair of young we have 720000 birds Two months later I esti mated the flock as fifty per cent larger the island being at that time in fact practically entirely and densely covered with birds It is not extravagant then to say that there were at least one million birds Of course very much smaller flocks are commonly esti mated at millions Nor again does it seem out of reason to say that had this island been opened by the government for extraction of guano each month that the work endured would have caused the loss from this island of nearly 1000 tons of guano a part of which quantity it is true would have been deposited on other islands but a large part of which would doubtless have been irrevocably lost However the main point to bear in mind both from the point of view of the economist and from that of the naturalist is thisthat the continual disturbance of the birds means inevitably their gradual extermination ROBERT E COKEn LIMA PERU April 8 1908 SOCIETIES AND ACADEMIES THE PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY OF

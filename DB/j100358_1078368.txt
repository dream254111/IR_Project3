INTERESTED IN THE PROBLEMS OF HIGHSCHOOL EDUCATION CAN ESCAPE CONTACT WITH THE WORK OF THE UPPER GRADES FURTHERMORE THE METHODS OF SCIEN TIFIC STUDY OF SCHOOL PROBLEMS RECOGNIZE NO SHARP DIVISION BETWEEN LOWER SCHOOLS AND HIGHER SCHOOLS THE HIGHSCHOOL TEACHER IS DRIVEN ACCORD INGLY TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL THE SCIENTIFIC STUDIES MADE BY WORKERS IN THE ELEMENTARY FIELD INDEED SO MUCH MORE RAPID HAS BEEN THE PROGRESS OF STANDARDIZATION AND MEASUREMENT IN ELEMENTARY SUBJECTS THAN IN HIGHSCHOOL SUBJECTS THAT THOSE WHO WOULD PERFECT SCIENTIFIC TESTS ARE OFFERED BETTER EXAMPLES IN THE ELEMENTARY FIELD THAN THEY CAN FIND IN THE SECONDARY FIELD THIS ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION IS THE PREFACE TO THE EDITORIAL ANNOUNCE MENT THAT THE SCHOOL REVIEW HAS ENTERED INTO A CLOSER AFFILIATION THAN EVER BEFORE WITH THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL THE CLOSER UNION WILL NOT CARRY THE SCHOOL REVIEW OUT OF ITS OWN PROPER FIELD WHICH IS THE DISCUSSION OF HIGHSCHOOL PROBLEMS BUT THE REVIEW WILL AIM TO COORDINATE ITS WORK MORE FULLY WITH THAT OF THE OTHER JOURNAL THE COMBINATION IS UNDERTAKEN WITH A VIEW FIRST TO INSURING A MORE COMPLETE REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE OF EDUCATION THERE WILL BE IN BOTH JOURNALS MORE SPACE DEVOTED TO SUMMARIES AND REVIEWS IT IS HOPED 48EDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT 49 THAT NO SIGNIFICANT MATERIAL WILL ESCAPE ADEQUATE NOTICE IN ADDITION TO THE USUAL REVIEWS ARTICLES WILL BE PUBLISHED FROM TIME TO TIME SUMMARIZ ING THE WRITINGS IN PARTICULAR DEPARTMENTS SECONDLY BY UNITING THE FORCES OF THE TWO JOURNALS THE NEWS NOTES AND EDITORIAL COMMENTS WILL BE MADE TO SUPPLEMENT EACH OTHER THE REVIEW WILL CONTINUE TO GIVE FIRST PLACE TO NEWS REGARDING THE HIGH SCHOOL IT WILL COME OUT AS BEFORE ON THE FIRST OF THE MONTH THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL WILL COME OUT ON THE FIFTEENTH OF THE MONTH AND WILL CARRY ON THE SAME GENERAL LINE OF COMMENT ON EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENTS STRESS ING HOWEVER THE DOINGS OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS THIRDLY THE JOURNALS UNITE FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUPPORTING CERTAIN MONOGRAPHS OR LONGER PUBLICATIONS WHICH ARE TOO BULKY FOR THE JOURNALS THEMSELVES IT WAS ORIGINALLY PLANNED THAT THESE CHANGES SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PAGES PUBLISHED IN EACH ISSUE OF THE JOURNALS THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL HAS INDEED BEEN BROUGHT UP TO THE SIZE OF THE REVIEW BUT THE UNTIMELY INCREASE IN THE COST OF PUBLICATION HAS PREVENTED THE REVIEW FROM ENLARGING AT ONCE IT IS THE HOPE AND CONFIDENT EXPECTATION OF THE EDITORS THAT THEY CAN VERY SHORTLY EXPAND IN SPITE OF THE COST OF PAPER EVERY SUBSCRIBER ADDED TO THE LIST MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO ENLARGE THESE PUBLICATIONS THE REVIEW WILL BE ENLARGED AS FAST AND AS FAR AS ITS RESOURCES PERMIT THE REVIEW EXISTS FOR ONE SOLE PURPOSE NAMELY TO PROMOTE THE BETTER ORGANI ZATION AND CONDUCT OF SCHOOLS ITS EDITORS HAVE NO COMPUNCTIONS WHATSOEVER IN ASKING THOSE WHO KNOW THE REVIEW TO SUPPORT IT WITH CONTRIBUTIONS OF ARTICLES NEWS ITEMS AND COMMUNICATIONS AND WITH THAT FORM OF

COMING TO RECOGNIZE THE DEMOCRATIC INFLUENCES WHICH UNDERLY THE PRESENT TENDENCIES IN EDUCATION THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS RADICAL STEP WILL BE BETTER UNDERSTOOD WHEN WE RECALL THAT GOUCHER IS ONE OF

CARNEY STATE SUPERVISOR OF NORMAL TRAINING HIGH SCHOOLS MINNESOTA LEONARD P AYERS OF THE RUSSELL SAGE FOUNDA TION F J KELLY DEAN OF THE COLLEGE OF EDUCATION KANSAS SUPERIN TENDENT CHARLES E CHADSEY DETROIT PROFESSOR GEORGE C STRAYER TEACHERS COLLEGE COLUMBIA PRINCIPAL J STANLEY BROWN JOLIET ILLINOIS PRINCIPAL FRANKLIN W JOHNSON UNIVERSITY HIGH SCHOOL CHICAGO THE DANFORD LAW IN OHIO UNDER THE HEADING A DISGRACE TO THE PROFESSION THE OHIO TEACHER CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING VIGOROUS EDITORIAL THE OPERATIONS OF THE DANFORD LAW ARE SO PLAINLY INIQUITOUS THAT IT CAN HARDLY FIND A DEFENDER ANYWHERE IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE THE STRANGE THING ABOUT IT IS THAT SUCH A MEASURE COULD BE ENACTED THE DANFORD LAW WAS PASSED BY THE LAST SESSION OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY AND IS NOT A PART OF THE CODE PASSED IN 1913 ON CERTIFICATION OF TEACHERS IT PROVIDES THAT A PERSON WHO HAS NEVER HAD ANY HIGHSCHOOL EDUCATION MAY BE GRANTED A CERTIFICATE TO TEACH ONE YEAR SUCH TEACHER IS NOT REQUIRED TO HAVE ANY NORMAL TRAINING AFTER SUCH TEACHER HAS TAUGHT ONE YEAR THE STATE WOULD REQUIRE HIM TO HAVE AT LEAST ONE YEAR OF HIGHSCHOOL EDUCATION AND ALSO THE SAME AMOUNT OF NORMAL TRAINING THAT IS REQUIRED OF EXPERIENCED TEACHERS IN OTHER WORDS THE GREAT STATE OF OHIO SAYS THAT AN EIGHTEENYEAROLD BOY WHO HAS HAD NEITHER NORMALEDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT 53 TRAINING NOR HIGHSCHOOL TRAINING MAY BE GIVEN CHARGE OF THIRTY OR FORTY CHILDREN AND PRACTICE UPON THEM FOR ONE YEAR BUT AFTER THE DAMAGE OF MALPRACTICE HAS BEEN DONE THE STATE SAYS TO HIM HE IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY EQUIPPED TO TEACH A SECOND YEAR UNTIL HE HAS ACQUIRED FURTHER ACADEMIC PROFESSIONAL TRAINING THIS TEACHER WITH LIMITED EQUIPMENT COMPETES ON THE MARKET WITH TEACHERS WHO HAVE SPENT FOUR YEARS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND TWO YEARS IN NORMAL SCHOOL EACH MAY BE EMPLOYED AT THE SAME SALARY IF THE NORMAL COLLEGE GRADUATE DEMANDS MORE THAN THE MINIMUM SALARY SOME BOARDS WOULD PREFER TO EMPLOY THE CHEAPER TEACHER THE WHOLE MEASURE IS A DELIBERATE SLAP AT PROFESSIONAL TRAINING AND AT PROFESSIONAL TRAINING SCHOOLS THE STANDARD SET UP BY THIS LAW WOULD SATISFY THE DEMANDS OF THE PUBLIC A QUARTER OF A CENTURY AGO BUT NOT NOW OHIO HAS BEEN MADE THE BUTT OF RIDICULE BY OTHER STATES THROUGH THE OPERATIONS OF THIS MEASURE IT SHOULD BE REPEALED AT THE VERY FIRST OPPORTUNITY THE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY OF CHICAGO A FEW WEEKS AGO CHICAGO AND THE COUNTRY AT LARGE WERE PROMISED ANOTHER BITTER FIGHT BETWEEN  ADMINISTRATION  AND  ANTIADMINISTRATION  ALDERMEN THE REPORT WAS ABROAD THAT THE THOMPSON FACTION WAS PRE PARED TO FIGHT TO THE DEATH THE RECENT RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COUNCIL COMMITTEE WHICH HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING SCHOOL CONTROL HAPPILY AS WE GO TO PRESS OPPOSITION TO THE PROPOSED SCHOOL INNOVATIONS DOES NOT SEEM TO BE DEVELOPING MUCH STRENGTH INDEED IT SEEMS QUITE LIKELY THAT CHICAGO WILL SUBMIT TO THE LEGISLATURE A REQUEST FOR A THOROUGH REORGANI ZATION OF SCHOOL CONTROL ALDERMAN BUCKS COMMITTEE PROPOSES THAT THE MAYORS POWER OF APPOINTING BOARD MEMBERS BE TRANSFERRED TO THE ELECTORATE IN OTHER WORDS THAT SO FAR AS POSSIBLE SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION BE TAKEN OUT OF POLITICS OF COURSE NO ONE BELIEVES THAT SUCH A CONSUMMATION CAN EVER BE ACTUALLY ATTAINED ESPECIALLY IN A CITY OF OVER TWO MILLIONS THE PRO POSAL CONTEMPLATES THE ELECTION OF SCHOOLBOARD MEMBERS FOR CHICAGO ON THE SAME PLAN USED FOR ELECTING THE TRUSTEES FOR THE STATE UNIVERSITY IT IS TO BE REGRETTED THAT THE NAMES OF CANDIDATES FOR ANY SUCH POSITIONS HAVE TO APPEAR ON PARTY TICKETS WHO ARE THE MEMBERS OF ALDERMAN BUCKS COMMITTEE AND WHAT HAVE THEY INVESTIGATED  THEY ARE A COMMITTEE OF THE COMMON COUNCIL A SUBCOMMITTEE ON SCHOOLS UNDER CHAIRMAN ROBERT M BUCK OF THE THIRTYTHIRD WARD WHO54 THE SCHOOL REVIEW FOR NEARLY A YEAR HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING THE CAUSES AND THE EFFECTS OF THE SOCALLED LOEB RULES OF THE CHICAGO SCHOOL BOARD THE FIRST IMPORTANT LOEB RULE COMPELLED CHICAGO TEACHERS TO GIVE UP MEMBERSHIP IN A LABOR UNION CALLED A TEACHERS FEDERATION THE SECOND EXPELLED NEARLY ONE HUNDRED TEACHERS WHO HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED WITH FEDERATION ACTIVITIES TO BE SURE SOME OF THESE TEACHERS HAD BEEN RANKED INEFFICIENT BUT MOST OF THOSE EXPELLED HAD BEEN ACTIVE IN THE FEDERATION AND HAD BEEN RANKED GOOD TO EXCELLENT THE SCHOOL REVIEW ASSERTS THAT THE OBJECTIONABLE FEATURE OF THIS LOEB RULE IS GENERALLY OVERLOOKED IT IS NOT THE INJUSTICE TO CERTAIN GOOD TEACHERS ALTHOUGH THAT IS BAD ENOUGH THE CHIEF OBJECTIONABLE FEATURE IS NOT THE THROWING OF SEVERAL THOUSAND POSITIONS EACH YEAR INTO JEOPARDY AT THE WHIMS OF FACTIONS IN A POLITICAL SCHOOL BOARD THESE OBJECTIONS ARE BAD ENOUGH BUT BACK OF THEM AND OTHER OBJECTIONS LIES THE ESSENCE OF THE MATTER THE APPOINTMENT AND REMOVAL OF TEACHERS IS ESSENTIALLY AN ADMINISTRATIVE DUTY WHICH OUGHT TO BE LODGED NOT IN A SCHOOL BOARD BUT IN A COMPETENT FAIRMINDED AND COURAGEOUS CITY SUPERINTENDENT THE LOEB RULES THEN MADE POSSIBLE YES ALMOST INEVITABLE UNDER THE PRESENT SYSTEM ARE THE SUBJECTS OF INVESTIGATION OF MR BUCKS COM MITTEE WITH UNERRING LOGIC THE COMMITTEE HAS SEEN BENEATH THE RULES TO FUNDAMENTAL CAUSES NAMELY A LARGE SCHOOL BOARD APPOINTED SHOT THROUGH WITH POLITICS EXERCISING BOTH LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS CONTROLLING BOTH GENERAL POLICIES AND ADMINISTRATIVE DETAILS WHAT ARE THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMITTEE  AFTER OUTLINING A LONG LIST OF FINDINGS THE COMMITTEE SUBMITTED THE FOLLOWING RECOM MENDATIONS TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE COUNCIL THAT THE CITY COUNCIL ADOPT AS ITS POLICY THE CONSTRUCTIVE PROGRAM HEREIN AFTER SET FORTH AND SEEK TO UNITE THE FORCES OF THE CITY WHO ARE PATRIOTICALLY LOYALLY AND UNSELFISHLY INTERESTED IN THE WELFARE OF THE GREATEST OF OUR INSTITU TIONSTHE PUBLIC SCHOOLIN A CAMPAIGN TO OBTAIN THE RECOMMENDED LEGISLATION AT SPRINGFIELD TO INDUCE THE BOARD OF EDUCATION TO ENACT AN ADMINISTRATIVE CODE SUCH AS IS HEREINAFTER RECOMMENDED AND WHICH IT CAN NOW DO UNDER ITS PRESENT POWERS WITHOUT WAITING FOR NEW LEGISLATION AND IN A CITYWIDE EFFORT TO EDUCATE THE VOTERS OF THE CITY TO AN AWAKENED UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN MADE IN THE SCIENCE OF EDUCATION WHILE CHICAGO STOOD BY AND MARKED TIME AND TO TRAIN THEM IN EFFICIENCY IN GOVERNMENT OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM THAT MOLDS OUR FUTURE CITIZENS AND MAKES THEM AMERICAN OR NOT AS IT IS EFFICIENT OR INEFFICIENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE BE REQUESTED TO AMEND AT THIS SESSION THE SCHOOL LAW GOVERNING CITIES OF MORE THAN IOOOOO POPULATION SO THAT IT SHALL PROVIDE AS FOLLOWSEDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT 55 THE BOARD OF EDUCATION SHALL CONSIST OF SEVEN MEMBERS ELECTED AT LARGE THE TERM OF OFFICE OF MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION SHALL BE SIX YEARS EACH MEMBER SHALL RECEIVE A SALARY OF I5OO A YEAR THE MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION SHALL BE ELECTED AT THE REGULAR CITY ELECTION EACH EVENNUMBERED YEAR ON A NONPARTISAN BALLOT AT THE REGULAR CITY PRIMARY ELECTION THE SAME PRACTICE SHALL PREVAIL THE NAMES APPEARING ON THE PRIMARY BALLOT BY PETITION THE SAME BALLOT BEING USED BY THE VOTERS OF ALL PARTIES IF AT THE PRIMARY ELECTION ANY CANDIDATE OBTAIN A MAJORITY OF ALL THE VOTES CAST HE SHALL BE DECLARED ELECTED THE NAMES OF TWICE AS MANY AS FAIL TO OBTAIN A MAJORITY SHALL BE PLACED UPON THE TICKET AT THE ELECTION IN THE ORDER OF THE NUMBER OF VOTES RECEIVED AT THE PRIMARY BEGINNING WITH THE ONE RECEIVING THE GREATEST NUMBER THE NAMES SHALL BE ROTATED UPON THE BALLOTS BY WARDS OR PRECINCTS BOTH AT THE PRIMARY AND AT THE ELECTION THE TOP NAME IN ONE DIVISION BEING DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM IN THE NEXT WOMEN MAY VOTE FOR MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION AND ARE ELIGIBLE TO BE ELECTED TO MEMBERSHIP VACANCIES MAY BE FILLED BY THE BOARD UNTIL THE NEXT REGULAR CITY ELECTION WHEN THEY SHALL BE FILLED BY THE VOTERS AMONG THE POWERS OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION SHALL BE THESE TO APPOINT AN ATTORNEY AND A COMPTROLLER WHO SHALL BE DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE TO THE BOARD IN THE DISCHARGE OF ITS LEGISLATIVE INSPECTORIAL AND CUSTODIAN FUNCTIONS AND WHO SHALL NOT BE UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE SUPERINTENDENT TO APPOINT DISINTERESTED EXPERTS FROM TIME TO TIME TO REPORT DIRECTLY TO THE BOARD CONCERNING THE EFFICIENCY OF THE SCHOOLS AND THE EMPLOYEES OF THE BOARD TO EXECUTE A CONTRACT WITH THE GENERAL SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS FOR NOT TO EXCEED FOUR YEARS SUCH CONTRACT TO CONTAIN PROVISION FOR CANCELLATION FOR CAUSE TO SUBMIT QUESTIONS OF EDUCATIONAL POLICY TO THE PEOPLE BY REFERENDUM EITHER BY PASSING ORDINANCES CONTINGENT UPON APPROVAL BY REFERENDUM OR BY SUBMITTING QUESTIONS OF PUBLIC POLICY THE REPORT DIRECTS THAT THE LEGISLATIVE ACTION PERMIT THE PASSAGE OF AN ORDINANCE TO GOVERN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM WHICH SHALL DEFINE THE FUNCTIONS POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE GENERAL SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS HIS ASSISTANTS TEACHERS AND OTHER EMPLOYEES LET FRIENDS AND OPPONENTS OF THE PROPOSALS READ CAREFULLY THIS FIRST PARAGRAPH LET THEM BE SURE THAT THEIR MOTIVES REACH THE LENGTH OF THAT CIVIC APPEAL LET THE BATTLE BE JOINED ON THE MERITS OF THE PRO POSALS NOT ON THE DESIRE TO RETAIN POLITICAL POWER THE SUPERIORITY OF A SMALL UNPARTISAN BOARD IS PERHAPS NOT UNQUESTIONED THE WISDOM OF A 1500 SALARY IS PERHAPS DOUBTFUL THE MODE OF ELECTION MIGHT BE IMPROVED LET THE FIGHT TURN UPON THESE ISSUES THE ADMINISTRATION56 THE SCHOOL REVIEW OF MAYOR THOMPSON HAS ANOTHER LARGE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE ITS FOLLOWERS FALL INTO LINE THIS TIME FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS TO CRUSH THE IMPLICATION THAT ANTIADMINISTRATION ALDERMEN STAND FOR GOOD SCHOOLS WHILE ADMINIS TRATION ALDERMEN STAND PRIMARILY FOR GOOD POLITICS THE ADMINISTRATION HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO HELP THRASH OUT AN IMPROVED SYSTEM OF SCHOOL CONTROL BASED ON SOME MODIFICATION OF ALDERMAN BUCKS RECOMMENDA TIONS HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE TO SPRINGFIELD A REQUEST FROM A UNITED CHICAGO FOR SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT IN SHORT JUST NOW IF WE HAVE AN ADMINISTRATION BIG ENOUGH TO STOP PLAYING POLITICS ON A NONPOLITICAL MATTER AND TO SUBSTITUTE DISINTERESTED CITIZENSHIP CHICAGO MAY HOPE TO SEE LARGELY DISAPPEAR THE CONSTANT BICKERINGS AND JEALOUSIES AND WASTE AND UNREST THAT HAVE PLAYED HAVOC WITH OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM FOR TEN YEARS THE COUNCIL COMMITTEE HAS INDEED SEEN THAT THE DISMISSAL OF TEACHERS UNDER THE LOEB RULE WAS MERELY AN INDICATION A SYMPTOM OF A DISEASE WHOSE CAUSE LIES IN THE CONFUSING OF LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS IN A POLITICAL SCHOOL BOARD THE COMMITTEE DOES NOT FORGET HOWEVER THE SYMPTOM WITH THE SAME KEENNESS OF EDUCATIONAL PERCEPTION THAT CHARACTERIZES MOST OF ITS RECOMMENDATIONS THE COMMITTEE PROPOSES TO GIVE TO TEACHERS A REASONABLE SECURITY OF POSITION THE COMMITTEE WOULD MAKE A POSITION IN THE CITY SCHOOLS NO SINECURE JOB TO BE HELD INDEFINITELY PERMANENCY IS TO DEPEND ON CONTINUED AND INCREASING EFFICIENCY THE RECOMMENDATIONS PROVIDE THAT TEACHERS SHALL BE APPOINTED FROM YEAR TO YEAR FOR THE PROBATIONARY PERIOD OF THREE YEARS AFTER WHICH THEY SHALL BE REMOVED ONLY FOR CAUSE FOLLOWING A FULL HEARING OR FOR INEFFICIENCY OR NEGLECT OF DUTY AFTER NOTICE OF UNSATISFACTORY SERVICE AND OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE THEIR WORK ON THE CHARGE OF INEFFICIENCY OR NEGLECT OF DUTY AFTER NOTICE AND OPPOR TUNITY TO IMPROVE THE DECISION OF THE BOARD SHALL NOT BE SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY THE COURTS PROVIDED HOWEVER THAT SUCH DECISION SHALL BE BASED UPON THE WRITTEN DETAILED RECOMMENDATION OF THE GENERAL SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS AND UPON THE TEACHERS ANSWER WHICH RECOMMENDATION SHALL BE FILED SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE BOARD AND WITH THE TEACHER AGAINST WHOM THE CHARGE IS MADE AT LEAST THIRTY DAYS BEFORE THE DECISION BY THE BOARD AND PROVIDED FURTHER THAT THE TEACHER SHALL HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO ANSWER IN WRITING AND SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO CAUSE PUBLICATION OF THE RECOMMENDATION AND ANSWER WITHIN THE SAID THIRTY DAYS THE CRUX OF THE PROPOSAL THE VERY HEART OF THE PROPOSALS LIES IN A CAREFUL DEFINITION OF THE DUTIES OF THE CITY SUPERINTENDENT HE IS TO BECOME WHAT HE IS NOT NOWEDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT 57 IN CHICAGO AN EXECUTIVE OFFICER WITH PRACTICALLY UNRESTRICTED POWER IN HIS SPHERE HE SHALL INITIATE COURSES OF STUDY CHOOSE TEXTBOOKS DETER MINE SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT APPOINT DISCIPLINE AND DISMISS ALL TEACHERS AND ALL EMPLOYEES OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM NOT UNDER CIVIL SERVICE ETC AS THE SCHOOL REVIEW HAS REPEATEDLY POINTED OUT THE CITY SUPERIN TENDENT OUGHT TO ASSUME ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS JUST AS THE SUPERIN TENDENT OF A BUSINESS CONCERN ASSUMES HIS RESPONSIBILITIES HIS RELATION TO THE SCHOOL BOARD SHOULD BE LIKE THE RELATION OF A SUPERINTENDENT OF A BUSINESS CONCERN TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS THE LATTER MAY INITIATE NEW BUSINESS POLICIES USUALLY HOWEVER THEIR DUTIES LIE IN APPROVING AND MODIFYING POLICIES OUTHELD TO THEM BY THEIR SUPERINTENDENT SO IN THE CHICAGO SCHOOL SITUATION MR BUCKS COMMITTEE PROPOSES TO HAVE GENERAL EDUCATIONAL POLICIES DETERMINED BY THE SCHOOL BOARD AND EVEN IN SOME CASES BY THE CITY COUNCIL AND HERE LIES DANGER BUT THE PURELY ADMIN ISTRATIVE FEATURES OF THE SCHOOLS ARE TO BE DELEGATED TO THE SUPERINTENDENT IF HE PROVES INCOMPETENT THE REMEDY IS TO FIND SOME OTHER MAN WHO IS COMPETENT CORRELATION BETWEEN READING TESTS AND GENERAL ABILITY THERE IS NO PHASE OF EDUCATION THAT HAS UNDERGONE SUCH COMPLETE CHANGE IN METHOD OF PROCEDURE WITHIN THE LAST TEN YEARS AS HAS THE SCI ENCE OF EDUCATION ITSELF FORMERLY TEACHERS CONTENTED THEMSELVES BY STATING GENERAL TRUTHS ARRIVED AT FROM THEORETICAL AVERAGES TODAY NO POINT IS REGARDED AS CERTAIN UNLESS IT HAS WITHSTOOD EVERY KNOWN TEST THE VALUE OF A TEST DEPENDS UPON THE ACCURACY WITH WHICH IT MEASURES SOME SPECIFIC ABILITY AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT GIVES CLEARLY UNIFORM RESULTS UNDER SIMILAR CONDITIONS WHEN ONE IS MEASURING THE LIFTING POWER OF A MACHINE OR THE STRENGTH OF AN ACID THE SITUATION IS SIMPLE ENOUGH BUT WHEN BRAIN POWER IS TO BE MEASURED THERE IS AN ADDED UNCERTAINTY THAT LENDS ZEST TO THE EXPERIMENT THE EXPERIMENTER IS NEVER CERTAIN THAT HIS INSTRUMENT WILL REGISTER JUST WHAT HE IS TRYING TO GET AND HE IS NEVER QUITE SURE OF IDENTICAL CONDI TIONS AN EXPERIMENT CONDUCTED BY DR KING OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA IN THE SPRING OF 1916 IS AN INTERESTING CASE IN POINT DR KELLY IN RESPONSE TO AN INQUIRY STATED THAT NO CORRELATION BETWEEN THE KANSAS SILENTREADING TESTS AND OTHER SUBJECTS HAD YET BEEN MADE BUT THAT THERE WAS A GENERAL FEELING AMONG TEACHERS THAT THERE WAS SOME CORRELATION DR KING WITH THE HEARTY COOPERATION OF HIGHSCHOOL TEACHERS SET ABOUT FINDING THE RELATIONS HE REPORTS HIS RESULTS AS FOLLOWS58 THE SCHOOL REVIEW SOME FINDINGS REGARDING THE KANSAS SILENTREADING TEST AS A MEASURE OF ABILITY IN THE IOWA CITY HIGH SCHOOL THE FOLLOWING MEDIANS BY SEXES WERE FOUND GRADES GIRLS BOYS NINTH GRADE  21 24 TENTH GRADE  21 293 ELEVENTH GRADE  212 279 TWELFTH GRADE  308 345 IT APPEARS FROM THIS TEST THAT BOYS DO BETTER THAN GIRLS AND THAT THERE IS A SLIGHT CORRELATION WITH GRADE MORE NOTICEABLE IN THE CASE OF BOYS THESE GRADE MEDIANS ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE PUBLISHED ON THE SCORE SHEET ACCOMPANYING THESE TESTS VIZ NINTH GRADE 229 TENTH GRADE 258 ELEVENTH GRADE 260 TWELFTH GRADE 288 THE AVERAGE CLASS MARKS OF THESE STUDENTS OF THE IOWA CITY HIGH SCHOOL WERE COMPARED WITH THEIR GRADES IN THIS TEST AS FOLLOWS STUDENTS AVERAGING E MADE A MEDIAN GRADE OF 420 STUDENTS AVERAGING G MADE A MEDIAN GRADE OF 413 STUDENTS AVERAGING M MADE A MEDIAN GRADE OF 250 STUDENTS AVERAGING P MADE A MEDIAN GRADE OF 213 STUDENTS AVERAGING F MADE A MEDIAN GRADE OF 140 IT WILL BE SEEN THAT THERE IS A FAIRLY GOOD CORRELATION WITH CLASS STANDING AS FAR AS HIGHSCHOOL STUDENTS ARE CONCERNED THIS SAME SILENTREADING TEST WAS GIVEN CERTAIN GROUPS OF UNIVERSITY STU DENTS WITH THE FOLLOWING RESULTS FIFTYNINE FRESHMAN ENGINEERS AFTER ONE SEMESTERS WORK IN THE COLLEGE OF APPLIED SCIENCE MADE A MEDIAN GRADE OF 383 THIS TEST WAS UNFORTUNATELY GIVEN AFTER TEN OR MORE OF THE WEAKEST STUDENTS HAD BEEN ELIMINATED FROM THE CLASS AS FAILURES IN THE SPRING OF I916 94 LIBERALARTS JUNIORS AND SENIORS MOSTLY WOMEN WERE GIVEN THE TEST THEIR MEDIAN GRADE WAS 348 RANGE I64536 RANGE OF MIDDLE 50 PER CENT 299404 THERE WAS NO UNIVERSITY JUNIOR OR SENIOR WHO MADE A GRADE EQUAL TO THE TEST HIGHSCHOOL GRADE OF 68 MADE BY THE VALEDICTORIAN OF THE CLASS OF I916 VARIOUS COEFFICIENTS OF COORDINATION SPEARMANFOOT RULE FORMULA BETWEEN THE RANKS OF THE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN THE KANSAS SILENTREADING TEST AND THEIR RANKS IN CERTAIN OTHER TESTS OF ABILITY WERE CAREFULLY COMPUTED FRESHMAN ENGINEERS SPRING OF 1916 KANSAS SILENTREADING TEST AND HARDOPPOSITES TEST R O 18 KANSAS SILENTREADING TEST AND SCHOLASTIC RANK R 0 I2 HARD OPPOSITES AND SCHOLASTIC RANK  R 042EDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT 59 IT WILL BE SEEN FROM THE ABOVE THAT THE RESULTS OF THE HARDOPPOSITES TEST ARE A MUCH BETTER MEASURE OF THE SORT OF ABILITY THAT IS EXPRESSED IN CLASS RANKS THAN IS THE KANSAS SILENTREADING TEST IN THE CASE OF THE JUNIOR AND SENIOR LIBERALARTS STUDENTS EVEN MORE INTER ESTING RESULTS WERE OBTAINED THESE STUDENTS WERE TESTED TWICE READING TEST NO I AND READING TEST NO 2 FOR EFFICIENCY IN SILENT READING THE OBJECT OF THESE TESTS WAS TO DETERMINE THE RELATIVE EFFICIENCY OF SLOW AND RAPID READERS THE METHOD AND FINDINGS OF THIS INVESTIGATION WILL SOON APPEAR IN SCHOOL AND SOCIETY IT IS SUFFICIENT TO STATE HERE THAT THE RELATION BETWEEN SPEED OF READING AND COMPREHENSION OF MATTER READ WAS FOUND BY BOTH TESTS TO BE INVERSE OF NEGATIVE THESE TWO READING TESTS FURNISHED TWO SERIES OF RANKS FOR THESE 94 STUDENTS IN EFFICIENCY IN SILENT READING OUR FIRST SILENT READING TEST RANKS WHEN COM PARED WITH THE RANKS IN THE KANSAS TEST YIELDED A SPEARMAN COEFFICIENT OF O 12 TEST NO 2 COMPARED WITH THE KANSAS TEST YIELDED A SPEARMAN COEFFICIENT OF I17 THE RELATIVE CLASS STANDINGS OF THESE 94 STUDENTS WAS CAREFULLY MEASURED AND COORDINATED WITH THE KANSAS TEST GAVE A SPEARMAN COEFFICIENT OF 004 ON THE OTHER HAND READING QUALITY BY OUR TEST AND HARD OPPOSITES GAVE A SPEARMAN COEFFICIENT OF 0 29 CLASS RANKS AND HARDOPPOSITES RANKS R O31 THE RANKS OF THE READING TESTS I AND 2 GAVE A COEFFICIENT R 0 25 OUR READING TESTS WITH CLASS RANKS YIELDED 022 AND O 29 RESPECTIVELY THESE COEFFICIENTS OF COORDINATION MAY BE TRANSMITTED INTO APPROXIMATE COEFFICIENTS OF CORRELA TION BY MULTIPLYING EACH BY THE FACTOR I 5 IT WILL BE SEEN THAT THE KANSAS SILENTREADING TEST SHOWS QUITE LOW CORRE LATIONS WITH OTHER MEASURES OF ABILITY IN THESE STUDENTS IN FACT OUR READING EFFICIENCY RANKS AND RANKS IN HARD OPPOSITES ARE MUCH BETTER MEASURES OF ABILITY IN CONCLUSION THE KANSAS SILENTREADING TEST WHILE SHOWING SOME RELATION TO THE ABILITY OF HIGHSCHOOL STUDENTS DOES NOT SEEM TO BE A GOOD MEASURE OF ABILITY OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN OUR OPINION IT IS NOT A TEST OF READING AT ALL BUT OF ABILITY TO FOLLOW DIRECTIONS AND TO SOLVE SIMPLE PROBLEMS DIRECTED READING FOR A LONG TIME PERSONS INTERESTED IN EDUCATION HAVE FELT THAT CON SIDERING THE MONEY AND THE ENERGY EXPENDED THE RETURNS REPRESENTED BY A LOVE OF READING GOOD BOOKS HAVE BEEN VERY SCANT THE WISCONSIN STATE TEACHERS ASSOCIATION OF 1915 IN AN ATTEMPT TO MEET THE SITUATION FORMED AN ORGANIZATION TO BE KNOWN AS THE WISCONSIN TEACHERS AND YOUNG PEOPLES READING CIRCLE WHOSE BUSINESS SHOULD BE TO PUT THE RIGHT SORT OF READING INTO THE HANDS OF THE INEXPERIENCED AND TO STIMULATE INTEREST BY ACKNOWLEDGING IN SOME WAY THE EFFORT MADE60 THE SCHOOL REVIEW THE READING CIRCLE HAS JUST ISSUED ITS 191617 LIST MADE IN CON FORMITY WITH THE TOWNSHIP LIBRARY REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE PLAN SUG GESTED IN THE LIST ALL PUPILS OF SCHOOL AGE BEYOND THE SECOND GRADE WHETHER IN SCHOOL OR NOT ARE TO BE GIVEN CREDIT FOR READING ONE

ARRANGED BY SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES A READING COURSE FOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS FOR THE STATE OF NEW YORK BULLETIN FOR SEPTEMBER 15 1915 OF THE UNIVERSITY OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK IS A SIMILAR PLAN AS FAR AS THE LIST AND A PLAN FOR GIVING CITY OR COUNTY CREDIT FOR READING IS CONCERNED THE NEW YORK PLAN LIMITS THE FICTION TO ONEHALF THE BOOKS READ THERE ARE MANY OTHER VALUABLE LISTS AMONG THESE ARE THE

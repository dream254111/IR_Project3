been a not at all infrequent spectacle in the East is to all appearances in its preliminary stages in Ohio The movement involves first the consolidation of the chief public utilities of Cleveland and Cin cinnati under one head and thereafter the assimilation of the already separately unified interests of Toledo and Columbus Pre sented geometrically it describes a grand triangle over the entire state with Cincinnati Cleveland and Toledo at the vertices and the capital city Columbus appropriately equidistant within As the initial step in the Cleveland phase of the movement it seems certain that the illuminating and traction interests of the city will join hands In the first place a comparison of the boards of directors and leading stockholders of the two companies involved reveals a striking community of interests The case of Mr Horace E Andrews is typical of this identity he is both president of the Cleveland Railway Comnpany and chairman of the board of directors of the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company Secondly throughout the eightyear struggle of the traction company to maintain itself against the lowfare campaign of Mr Johnson the electric light concern has been anything but a passive bystander Reports have repeatedly reached the public ear concerning aid and comfort given to a distressed brotherinarms In the i908 refer endum over the security grant Mr Samuel Scovil vicepresident and general nmanager of the Illuminating company threw off all disguise and openly took the stump against the grant going so far as to invade one of Mr Johnsons tent meetings and engage him in a warm controversy over the merits of the measure Thirdly the recently announced intention of the Cleveland Railway Co to pur chase a considerable quantity of its motive power from the Illumi nating company is generally regarded as an additional tightening of interests precedent to amalgamation Fourthly the unexplained 1 Since this article was written Mr Andrews has resigned from the presi dency of the railway company His interests and holdings however still remain the same 388NOTES 389 cessation of competition on the part of the Cuyahoga Light Co the Illuminating companys chief competitor and the withdrawal from management of its president Mlr John F Keys the erst while nemesis of the larger concern have cleared the field of all competitive opposition And finally the action last summer of the Illuminating company in announcing the issuance of 30000000 of bonds to be floated in the next few years completes the chain of evidence supporting the theory of consolidation As the present capitalization of the Illuminating company is only 6500000 and as the first section of the new issue is to be devoted to the retirement of old bonds it is obvious that so tremendous a sale is hardly to be undertaken in behalf of a single enterprise For before the total issue can be marketed a corresponding 30000000 of stock according to the laws of the state must be legally author ized Such an issue however is quite out of the question Even conceding a continuation of the present prosperity of the Illumi nating company it is hard to believe that it can attain in the next fifteen years a custom sufficient to justify a fivefold expansion of its present capitalization A doubling of the present stock once every three years would thereby be demanded an occurrence prob ably without precedent in American public utilities history On the contrary the series of developments just described happening within the last few months points to the more credible hypothesis of a conjunction of the two dominant companies mentioned But the Cleveland alignment we have been suggesting in no way compares to the local consolidations that have already occurred in the other three cities of the state and that are in active contempla tion for the near future It is these that furnish the strongest foundation for the theory of statewide consolidation The leading incidents of these groupings is herewith given in outline In I906 the Columbia Gas  Electric Co was incorporated in West Virginia for the purpose of doing business in Ohio One of its first acts was to absorb the Union Gas  Electric Co of Cincin nati an important competitor It then commissioned its new protege to negotiate a 99year lease of the property of another competitor the Cincinnati Gas  Electric Co which was accomplished The leasing appetite persisted and on April i I907 the Columbia directors closed a goyear lease of the property of the Cincinnati Newport  Covington Light  Traction Co thereby gaining partial control of the traction situation in Cincinnati and complete390 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY control in her two suburbs By this series of mergers public utility matters in the main were neatly sewed up for a long time to come most of the franchise grants being either for a long term or indefinite The significance of these segregations thus far amounts to this the principal public utilities of Cincinnati and her suburbs are now united in a close holding concern the Columbia Gas  Electric Co whose avowed purposeto control public service corporations especially in Cleveland and Cincinnatiseems from the growing similarity of the men and interests involved to be rapidly reaching consummation inasmuch as the almost perfected consolidation of the traction and electricity interests of Cleveland will render possible intercity consolidation at one stroke Turningy to Toledo and Columbus we find the situation admir ably prepared for the statewide consolidation It would take too long to review the history of the local mergers which have been going on in each place and we shall content ourselves with a brief summary of the results thus far obtained In the firstnamed city the Toledo Railways  Light Co is the dominant public service corporation Incorporated in July i9oi in Ohio it now controls all the street railway electric lighting gas hot water heating and power business of the city Its holdings include the entire capital stock of the Toledo  Maumee Valley Railway the Toledo Waterville  Southern RR the Toledo Ottawa Beach  Northern Railway the Toledo Gas Electric  Heating Co the Toledo  Western RR Co and the Ottawa Park Street Railway The concern is controlled by the wellknown EverettMoore syndicate both of whose chief members are heavily interested in the CincinnatiCleveland concernthe Columbia Gas  Electric Co It is readily seen that only a stroke of the pen will be needed to effect a consolidation of the Toledo concern with the big merger In Columbus public utilities are in almost as close a state of cohesion as in Toledo and the combination effected is ready for absorption by the state combine as soon as the latter will make the necessary overtures The Columbus Railway  Light Co in corporated under the laws of Ohio in May I903 has acquired a longterm lease control over the properties of the Columbus Railway Co the Columbus Edison Co the Columbus Traction Co and the Columbus Light Heat  Power Co Only one or two more stepsNOTES 39I are needed to complete the work of consolidation and conditions are at present very favorable for this purpose Apparently all that is needed is the master hand of Mr A S White of Cincinnati or of Mr Everett and Mr Moore of Toledo to achieve the coup The work of state consolidation therefore centers upon the weldingtogether of the two Cleveland public utilities and the Columbia Gas  Electric Company Thence the movement should spread to Toledo and take in the merged public utilities of that city afterward proceeding to Columbus whose corporations in the in terim will have perfected a local unification In conclusion it will be interesting to note another direction in which the consolidation of public utilities is being effected This is revealed in the activities of the East Ohio Gas Co a concern controlled by the Standard Oil Co and supplying natural gas to cities in eastern Ohio Kentucky West Virginia and western Pennsylvania Up to a few months ago the methods of the com pany disclosed nothing unusual its mode of expansion being geographical in character The absorption however in February of this year of all its artificial gas competitors in Cleveland and Cuyahoga County throws a new light upon its underlying ambition From this action and the frank admissions of its president Mr M B Daly it is now clear that the more fundamental purpose of the company is to force all the artificial gas plants of the large cities in its district out of business and to gain control of the gas business in the abovementioned states The legal road to this goal is clear An opinion handed down by AttorneyGeneral Denman of Ohio declares that there are no statutory obstacles in the way of this or any other form of public utility consolidation The rather indefinite provisions of the Valentine antitrust law form the only hindrance and these were felt to be too inadequate to be made the basis of an action of dissolution Moreover by a recent decision of the Su preme Court of Ohio which affects every public utility in the state the potentialities of consolidation in the estimation of corporation lawyers have been considerably increased According to the court franchises containing no specific time limit and sought to be defined as to rates etc by ordinance or other act of local legislative bodies cannot be enforced against the companys right to withdraw if any conditions attempted to be imposed are not found agreeable In actual practice this will mean that where a monopoly of local utili 1 Vide East Ohio Gas Co v City of Akron October i9 I909392 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY ties has been secured by a concern like the Columbia or East Ohio company the municipality will have nothing to do in making rate agreements except to accede to the companys best offer for the law will permit the company temporarily or permanently to shut down its plant and leave the city to choose between acceptance and going without the service T L SIDLO WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY

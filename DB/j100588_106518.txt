MADE WITH A VIEW TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE EARTHS DIURNAL MOTION IS PERFECTLY EQUABLE IN A LETTER FROM MR WILLIAM HERSCHEL OF BATH TO WILLIAM WATSON M D F R S READ JANUARY 11 1781 S I R BATH OCTOBER 18 1780 THE VARIOUS MOTIONS OF THE PLANET WE INHABIT THE AN NUAL REVOLUTION IN ITS ORBIT THE DIURNAL ROTATION ROUND ITS AXIS THE MENSTRUAL MOTION ROUND THE COMMON CENTER OF GRAVITY OF THE MOON AND EARTH THE PRECESSION OF THE EQUI NOCTIAL POINTS THE DIMINUTION OF THE OBLIQUITY OF THE ECLIPTIC THE NUTATION OF THE EARTHS AXIS IN SHORT EVERY ONE OF THE MOTIONS THAT ARISE FROM THE ACTIONS OF THE SUN MOON AND PLANETS COMBINED WITH THE SPHEROIDICAL FIGURE OF THE EARTH AND THE PROJECTILE AND ROTATORY MOTIONS FIRST IMPRESSED UPON IT HAVE ALL BEEN CONSIDERED BY ASTRONOMERS AND THEIR REAL AND APPARENT INEQUALITIES INVESTIGATED AND TO THE GREAT HONOUR OF MODERN ASTRONOMERS IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT NO SCIENCE HAS EVER MADE SUCH CONSIDERABLE STRIDES TOWARDS PERFECTION IN SO SHORT A TIME AS ASTRONOMY HAS DONE SINCE THE INVENTION OF THE TELESCOPE THERE IS ONE OF THE MOTIONS OF THE EARTH HOWEVER WHICH IT SEEMS HAS HITHERTO ESCAPED THE SCRUTINY OF OBSERVERS I MEAN THE DIURNAL ROTATION ROUND ITS AXIS THE PRINCIPAL REASON Q 2 WHY116 MR HERSCHELS ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS WHY THIS HAS NOT BEEN LOOKED INTO IS PROBABLY THE DIFFICULTY OF FINDING A PROPER STANDARD TO MEASURE IT BY SINCE IT IS ITSELF USED AS THE STANDARD BY WHICH WE MEASURE ALL THE OTHER MOTIONS WE HAVE INDEED NO CAUSE TO SUSPECT ANY VERY MATERIAL PERIO DICAL IRREGULARITY EITHER DIURNAL MENSTRUAL OR ANNUAL FOR THE GREAT PERFECTION OF OUR PRESENT TIMEPIECES WOULD HAVE DIS COVERED ANY CONSIDERABLE DEVIATION FROM THAT EQUABILITY WHICH WE HAVE HITHERTO ASCRIBED TO THE DIURNAL MOTION OF THE EARTH AND YET IT IS NOT PERHAPS ALTOGETHER IMPOSSIBLE BUT THAT INEQUALITIES MAY EXIST IN THIS MOTION WHICH IN AN AGE WHERE OBSERVATIONS ARE CARRIED TO SUCH A DEGREE OF REFINEMENT MAY BE OF SOME CONSEQUENCE TO SHEW HOW FAR TIMEKEEPERS THOUGH EVER SO PERFECT ARE FROM BEING A PROPER OR AT LEAST A SUFFICIENT STANDARD TO EXA MINE THE DIURNAL MOTION OF THE EARTH BY I MAY ASK WHETHER IT IS PROBABLE THAT ANY CLOCK WOULD HAVE DISCOVERED TO US THE ABERRATION OF THE FIXED STARS AND YET THAT ABERRATION PRODUCES A CHANGE IN LONGITUDE AND OF CONSEQUENCE IN RIGHT ASCENSION WHICH CAUSES AN ANNUAL IRREGULARITY IN A STARS COMING TO THE MERIDIAN WHICH A TIMEPIECE WERE IT A SUFFICIENT STANDARD WOULD SOON HAVE DISCOVERED AND WHICH WE MIGHT HAVE ATTRI BUTED TO AN INEQUALITY OF THE EARTHS DIURNAL MOTION HAD WE NOT BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH ITS REAL CAUSE AND IF WE WERE TO FIND OUT ANY APPARENT IRREGULARITY ACCELERATION OR RETARDATION SHOULD WE NOT MUCH RATHER SUSPECT THE CLOCK THAN THE DIURNAL MOTION I MAY THEREFORE VENTURE TO SAY THAT THE ABERRATION OF THE FIXED STARS THOUGH ATTENDED WITH THE ABOVE MENTIONED CON SEQUENCE WOULD FOR EVER HAVE REMAINED A SECRET TO US IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOUND OUT BY OTHER METHODS THAN TIMEKEEPERS NOW IF TIMEPIECES DO FAIL US IN THIS CRITICAL CASE WHERE WE STAND IN THE GREATEST NEED OF THEIR ASSISTANCE IT IS ALMOST IN VAINON THE ROTATION OF THE PLANETS C 117 VAIN TO EXPECT ANY HELP FROM ANOTHER QUARTER FOR WHAT MECHA NICAL MOVEMENT ON EARTH OR MOTION OF THE HEAVENS IS THERE THAT CAN MEASURE OUT SUCH EQUAL PORTIONS OF TIME AS WE REQUIRE TO COMPARE THE DIURNAL MOTION OF THE EARTH TO HOWEVER TO PRO CEED SINCE WE HAVE ALREADY GREAT PROOFS THAT THE DIURNAL MOTION OF THE EARTH IS IF NOT PERFECTLY EQUABLE AT LEAST MORE SO THAN ANY OTHER MOTION WE ARE ACQUAINTED WITH IT WILL NOT APPEAR ABSURD TO SUPPOSE THE DIURNAL ROTATION OF THE OTHER PLANETS TO BE SO LIKEWISE THIS SUGGESTED TO ME THE THOUGHTS OF ESTI MATING THE DIURNAL MOTION OF ONE PLANET VERY EXACTLY BY THAT OF ANOTHER MAKING EACH THE STANDARD OF THE OTHER IN THIS MANNER WE MAY OBTAIN A COMPARATIVE VIEW BY WHICH FUTURE ASTRONOMERS IF THEY SHALL HEREAFTER BE INCLINED TO PURSUE THE SUBJECT MAY BE ENABLED TO MAKE SOME ESTIMATE OF THE GENERAL EQUABILITY OF THE ROTATORY MOTIONS OF THE PLANETS FOR IF IN LENGTH OF TIME THEY SHOULD PERCEIVE SOME SMALL RETARDATION IN THE DIURNAL MOTION OF A PLANET OCCASIONED BY SOME RESISTANCE OF A VERY SUBTLE MEDIUM IN WHICH THE HEAVENLY BODIES PERHAPS MOVE OR ON THE OTHER HAND IF THERE SHOULD BE FOUND AN ACCELERATION FROM SOME CAUSE OR OTHER THEY MIGHT THEN ASCRIBE THE ALTERATION EITHER TO THE DIURNAL MOTION OF THE EARTH OR TO THE GYRATION OF THE OTHER PLANET ACCORDING AS CIRCUMSTANCES OR OBSERVED PHAENOMENA SHOULD MAKE ONE OR THE OTHER OF THESE OPINIONS MOST PROBABLE NOW THIS METHOD OF COMPARING TOGETHER DIFFERENT ROTATIONS OF SEVERAL PLANETS SIMPLE AS IT MAY APPEAR WAS NOT WITHOUT SOME DIFFICULTIES IN THE FIRST PLACE IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE COMMON ACCOUNT OF THEIR DIURNAL MOTIONS  WHICH

GENERAL WAY WAS MUCH TOO INACCURATE FOR THIS CRI TICAL PURPOSE THE GYRATION OF VENUS WAS STILL LESS TO BE DEPENDED UPON BEING ONLY NOTED TO THE HOUR WITHOUT THE MINUTES IT BECAME THEREFORE NECESSARY TO PROCEED TO OBSERVA TIONS OF A MORE DETERMINATE KIND FROM WHAT I HAD ALREADY SEEN OF THE ROTATION OF THE PLANETS I CONCLUDED THAT MARS ON SEVE RAL ACCOUNTS WOULD BE THE MOST ELIGIBLE PLANET FOR MY PURPOSE FOR THE SPOTS ON JUPITER CHANGE SO OFTEN THAT IT IS NOT EASY IF AT ALL POSSIBLE TO ASCERTAIN THE IDENTITY OF THE SAME APPEAR ANCE FOR ANY CONSIDERABLE LENGTH OF TIME NOR DO THE DARK SPOTS ONLY CHANGE THEIR PLACE WHICH MAY BE SUPPOSED TO BE LARGE BLACK CONGERIES OF VAPOURS AND CLOUDS SWIMMING IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF JUPITER BUT ALSO THE BRIGHT SPOTS THOUGH THEY MAY ADHERE FIRMLY TO THE BODY OF JUPITER MAY UNDERGO SOME APPARENT CHANGE OF SITUATION BY BEING DIFFERENTLY COVERED OR UNCOVERED ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER BY ALTERATIONS IN THE BELTS IT WILL BE SEEN HEREAFTER THAT I HAVE OBSERVED THE REVOLUTION OF A VERY BRIGHT SPOT NOT SUSPECTED OF ANY CHANGE OF SITUATION TO BE FIRST BY ONE SET OF OBSERVATIONS AT THE RATE OF 9 H 51 456 AND AFTERWARDS BY ANOTHER SET IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING AT THE RATE OF 9 H 50 48 AS THE PRINCIPAL BELTS ON JUPITER ARE EQUATORIAL AND AS WE HAVE CERTAIN CONSTANT WINDS UPON OUR PLANET ESPECIALLY NEAR THE EQUATOR THAT REGULARLY FOR CERTAIN PERIODS BLOW THE SAME WAY  IT IS EASILY SUPPOSED THAT THEY MAY FORM EQUATORIAL BELTS BY GATHERING TOGETHER THE VAPOURS WHICH SWIM IN OUR ATMOSPHERE AND CARRYING THEM ABOUT IN THE SAME DIRECTION THIS WILL BY ANALOGY ACCOUNT FOR ALL THE IRREGULARITIES OF JU  SEE ACTA ERUDITORUM 1687 DR HALLEYS ACCOUNT OF PERIODICAL WINDS 4 PITERSON THE ROTATION OF THE PLANETS C 119 PITERS REVOLUTIONS DEDUCED FROM SPOTS ON HIS DISK THAT MAY HAVE CHANGED THEIR SITUATION FOR IF WE SUPPOSE THE ROTATION OF JUPITER ACCORDING TO CASSINI TO BE 9 H 56 THEN SOME SPOTS THAT I HAVE OBSERVED MUST HAVE BEEN CARRIED THROUGH ABOUT 60 OF JUPITERS EQUATOR IN 22 OF HIS REVOLUTIONS OR DAYS THIS WOULD CERTAINLY BE A VERY GREAT VELOCITY IN THE CLOUDS WHICH IS HOWEVER NOT UNPARALLELED BY WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN OUR OWN ATMOSPHERE BUT TO RETURN TO MY PURPOSE ON THE PLANET MARS WE SEE SPOTS OF A DISSERENT NATURE THEIR CONSTANT AND DETERMINED SHAPE AS WELL AS REMARKABLE COLOUR SHEW THEM TO BE PERMANENT AND SASTENED THE BODY OF THE PLANET THESE WILL GIVE THE REVO LUTION OF HIS EQUATOR TO A GREAT CERTAINTY AND BY A GREAT NUM BER OF REVOLUTIONS TO A VERY GREAT EXACTNESS ALSO SUPPOSING THEN THAT BY A METHOD I SHALL HEREAFTER DESCRIBE WE CAN DE TERMINE WHETHER A SPOT ON THE DISK OF MARS IS OR IS NOT IN THE LINE WHICH JOINS THE CENTER OF THE EARTH AND THE CENTER OF THAT PLANET TO HALF AN HOURS TIME WITH CERTAINTY I BELIEVE TEN OR TWELVE MINUTES WILL BE FOUND SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PUR POSE IN THIS CASE WE SHALL IN 30 DAYS HAVE THE REVOLUTION TRUE TO A MINUTE AND BY CONTINUING THESE OBSERVATIONS FOR THREE MONTHS WE SHALL HAVE IT TO 20 WHEN WE ARE SO FAR CERTAIN WE CAN EASILY ARRIVE TO A MUCH GREATER DEGREE OF EXACTNESS FOR AS WE NOW CAN NO LONGER MISTAKE A WHOLE REVOLUTION IF WE TAKE THE TIME OF ANY PARTICULAR SPOTS BEING IN THE LINE WHICH JOINS THE CENTERS OF THE PLANETS DURING ONE OPPOSITION OF MARS AND TAKE THE SAME AGAIN AT OR NEAR THE NEXT OPPOSITION WE SHALL HAVE AN INTERVAL OF ABOUT 780 DAYS WHICH WILL GIVE THE DIURNAL MOTION OF THAT PLANET TRUE TO ABOUT 2 THE NEXT OPPOSITION WILL GIVE IT TO ONE AND SO FORTH BY WHICH MEANS AND BY TAKING A PROPER NUMBER OF SUCH PERIODS WE MAY DETERMINE THE ROTATION OF MARS120 MR HERSCHELS ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS MARS TO AS GREAT AN EXACTNESS AS WE SHALL THINK NECESSARY FOR THE PURPOSE OF OUR COMPARATIVE VIEW HAD SUCH OBSERVATIONS AS THESE BEEN MADE TWO THOUSAND OR PERHAPS ONLY SO MANY HUNDRED YEARS AGO WE MIGHT NOW BY REPEATING THEM MOST PROBABLY BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH SOME CURIOUS MINUTE CHANGES OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM THAT HAVE HITHERTO PASSED UNNOTICED THERE IS A CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH WOULD ALMOST CREATE A SUSPICION THAT THERE HAS BEEN SOME RETARDATION IN THE DIURNAL MOTION OF THE EARTH THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE EQUATORIAL AND POLAR DIAMETERS OF THE EARTH BY ACTUAL MEASUREMENT HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE ABOUT 36 ENGLISH MILES AND 9 TENTHS BUT BY A CALCULATION WHEREIN THE PRESENT ROTATION IS MADE USE OF IT WILL ONLY AMOUNT TO ABOUT 33 MILES AND 8 TENTHS FROM WHICH IT SHOULD SEEM PROBABLE THAT WHEN THE EARTH ASSUMED THE PRESENT FORM THE DIURNAL ROTATION WAS SOMEWHAT QUICKER THAN IT IS AT PRESENT BY WHICH MEANS THE CENTRIFUGAL FORCE BORE A GREATER PROPORTION TO THE FORCE OF GRAVITY TO WHICH IT IS CONTRARY AND THUS OCCASIONED A HIGHER ELEVATION OF THE EQUATORIAL PARTS BUT I WOULD NOT LAY MUCH STRESS UPON THIS ARGUMENT FOR IN THE CAL CULATION IT HAS BEEN SUPPOSED THAT THE EARTH IS NEARLY OF AN EQUAL DENSITY AT THE SURFACE AND TOWARDS THE CENTER WHICH IT SEEMS IS NOT AGREEABLE TO SOME LATE CURIOUS EXPERIMENTS AND CALCULATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE UNDER THE CONDUCT OF THE ASTRONOMER ROYAL UPON THE ATTRACTION OF A MOUNTAIN  THE RESULT OF WHICH OUGHT NOW TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION AND THE CALCULATION REPEATED IF ALL THE DATA COULD BE EXACTLY DE PENDED UPON IT WOULD BE PRACTICABLE ENOUGH FROM THE LAWS OF  SEE MR HUTTONS ACCOUNT OF THE CALCULATIONS MADE FROM THE SURVEY AND MEASURES TAKEN AT SCHEHALLIEN IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN THE MEAN

FORM AND THENCE TO SHEW WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN ITS DIURNAL MOTION WHEN IT ASSUMED THE SAME HOWEVER THESE ARE RESEARCHES THAT IN MY PRESENT SITUATION I NEITHER HAVE OPPORTUNITY NOR PERHAPS ABILITY ENOUGH TO INVESTIGATE PROPERLY AND WHICH THEREFORE I HOPE SOME OF OUR EXCELLENT MATHEMATICIANS WILL THINK WORTH WHILE TO LOOK INTO I SHALL NOW RELATE MY OBSERVATIONS ON JUPITER AND MARS THE TELESCOPES I USED ARE OF MY OWN CONSTRUCTION AND ARE A TWENTYFEET NEWTONIAN REFLECTOR A TENFEET REFLECTOR OF THE SAME FORM AND A SEVENFEET REFLECTOR ALREADY MENTIONED IN MY PAPER ON THE MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON MY TIME I GAINED BY EQUAL ALTITUDES TAKEN WITH A BRASS QUADRANT OF TWOFEET RADIUS CARRYING A TELESCOPE WHICH MAGNIFIES ABOUT 40 TIMES FOR THE CORRECTION OF ALTITUDES TAKEN OF THE SUN I USED DE LA LANDES TABLES I KEPT MY TIME BY TWO VERY GOOD PIECES ONE HAVING A DEAL PENDULUMROD THE OTHER A COMPOUNDED ONE OF BRASS AND IRON BOTH HAVING A PROPER CONTRIVANCE NOT TO STOP WHEN WINDING UP THE RATE OF GOING OF MY CLOCKS I DETERMINED BY THE TRANSIT OF STARS OBSERVATIONS ON JUPITER IN THE YEAR 1778 FEBRUARY 24 CLOCK 1 10 TOO SOON ABOUT 9 OCLOCK I SAW A BRIGHT BELT ON ONE PART OF THE DISK OF JUPITER SEE TAB V FIG

FIG 4 V O L LXXI R FEBRUARY122 MR HERSCHELS ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS FEBRUARY 25 8 H THE SAME BRIGHT BELT I OBSERVED YESTERDAY EXTENDS ALL OVER 8 H 45 IT IS DIVIDED BY A DARKISH SPOT SITUATED AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE CENTER AS IN FIG 5 9 H 5 THE SMALL DARK DIVISION IS ADVANCED A LITTLE FARTHER THAN THE CENTER AS IN FIG 6 9 H 23 THE SPOT IS VISIBLY ADVANCED A CONSIDERABLE DEAL FARTHER MARCH 2 8 H

LINE BE DRAWN PERPENDICULAR TO THE EQUATORIAL BELT AND THROUGH THE CENTER THE END OF THE EQUATORIAL BELT NOW TOUCHES IT FIG 8 13 H 49 THE DARKISH SPOT IN WHICH THERE HAS BEEN SOME ALTERATION SINCE YESTERDAY SEEMS NOW TO BE IN THE CENTER FIG 9 MARCH 14 THE CLOCK ALTERED TO TRUE EQUATED TIME BUT THE RATE OF GOING NOT CHANGED BEING WELL REGULATED 7 H 35 THE SPOT IS NOW IN THE CENTER BUT DOES NOT SEEM QUITE TO FILL THE WHITE BELT NOR IS IT SO LARGE AND DISTINCT AS IT WAS BEFORE FIG 10 APRIL 7 9 H 31 THERE ARE THREE DARK SPOTS IN THE EQUA TORIAL BELT NEARLY IN THE CENTER SEE FIG 11 APRIL 12 7 H

IT WILL NOT BE AMISS TO OBSERVE THAT THE SPOTS AS WELL AS A GREAT MANY OTHER PHAENOMENA WERE WATCHED AS THEY CAME ON PASSED OVER THE CENTER AND WENT OFF THE DISK OF JUPITER BUT I HAVE ONLY SELECTED THOSE OBSERVATIONS THAT WERE NECESSARY TO MY PRESENT PURPOSE COMPARING TOGETHER THE OBSERVATIONS THAT WERE MADE IN THE YEAR 1778 FEBRUARY 24TH AND MARCH 3D WE OBTAIN AN INTERVAL OF 7 DAYS 34 MINUTES

SO EXCEEDINGLY VARIOUS THAT IT IS EVI DENT JUPITER IS NOT A PROPER PLANET FOR THE CRITICAL PURPOSE OF A COMPARATIVE VIEW OF THE DIURNAL MOTIONS NOR CAN THIS GREAT VARIETY PROCEED FROM ANY INACCURACY IN THE OBSERVATIONS FOR IN MY OPINION IT IS NOT WELL POSSIBLE TO MAKE A MISTAKE IN THE SITUATION OF A SPOT THAT SHALL AMOUNT TO SO MUCH AS FIVE MINUTES OF TIME THE OBSERVATION OF APRIL 23 1779 WAS MADE WITH A VIEW TO ASCERTAIN THIS POINT WHEN IT WAS FOUND THAT FIVE MI NUTES OF TIME MADE A SENSIBLE DIFFERENCE IN THE SITUATION OF A SPOT WHEN NEAR THE CENTER IF WE REDUCE THE SYNODICAL REVOLUTIONS TO SYDEREAL ONES THE RESULT WILL BE SO LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM THE ABOVE THAT I HAVE NOT THOUGHT IT WORTH WHILE TO DO IT IN THIS PLACE BY A COMPARISON OF THE DIFFERENT PERIODS IT APPEARS THAT A SPOT WHICH IS CARRIED ABOUT IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF JUPITER GENERALLY SUFFERS AN ACCELERA TION OR WHICH IS THE SAME THING PERFORMS ITS REVOLUTIONS BY DEGREES IN LESS TIME THAN IT DID AT FIRST FOR THE SPOT OBSERVED IN 1778 MOVED AT THE FOLLOWING RATES FROM FEBRUARY 25 TO MARCH 2 IN 9 H 55 20 TO MARCH 3 NEARLY THE SAME TO MARCH 14 IN 9 H 55 4 FROM MARCH 2 TO MARCH 3 IN 9 H 55 40 TO MARCH 14 IN 9 H 54 58 FROM MARCH 3 TO MARCH 14 IN 9 H 54 53 IN 1779 A SPOT MOVED FROM APRIL 14 TO APRIL 19 AT THE RATE OF 9 H 51 45 TO APRIL 23 IN 9 H 51 24 AND FROM APRIL 19 TO APRIL 24 IN 9 H 50 48 ALL WHICH IS AGREEABLE ENOUGH TO THE THEORY OF EQUATORIAL WINDS SINCE IT MAY PROBABLY TAKE UP SOMETIME BEFORE A SPOT CAN ACQUIRE A SUFFICIENT VELOCITY TO GO AS FAST AS THOSE WINDS MAY BLOW AND BY THE BY IF JUPITERS SPOTS SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF HIS YEAR AND BE FOUND IN SOME TO BE ACCELERATED IN OTHERS TO BE RETARDED IT WOULD ALMOST AMOUNT TO A DEMONSTRA TION OF HIS MONSOONS AND THEIR PERIODICAL CHANGES BUT IF HIS 7 AXISON THE ROTATION OF THE PLANETS C 127 AXIS SHOULD NOT BE INCLINED ENOUGH TO HIS ORBIT TO OCCASION SUCH A CHANGE THEY MAY PROBABLY ALWAYS BLOW IN THE SAME DIRECTION OBSERVATIONS

24 H 39 23 04 AS THESE THREE PERIODS ARE SUPPORTED BY OBSERVATIONS OF EQUAL VALIDITY I SHALL TAKE A MEAN OF THEM ALL FOR THE NEAREST APPROXI MATION TO THE TRUE SYDEREAL REVOLUTION OF MARS ON HIS AXIS WHICH THEREFORE IS 24 H 39 21 67 IT REMAINS NOW ONLY TO SEE HOW FAR WE MAY DEPEND UPON THIS DETERMINATION OF MARSS DIURNAL ROTATION AS COMING NEAR THE TRUTH AND LOOKING OVER THOSE CAUSES WHICH MAY POSSIBLY PRO DUCE ANY ERRORS WE FIND FIRST OF ALL THAT IN THE LONG BIENNIAL PERIODS A MISTAKE IN THE NUMBER OF REVOLUTIONS WOULD PRODUCE A CONSIDERABLE DEVIATION FROM TRUTH SECONDLY IN THE OBSERVA TIONS OF A SPOT WHICH MOVES SO SLOW WE ARE ALSO LIABLE TO SOME CONSIDERABLE MISTAKE IN ESTIMATING THE TIME WHEN IT COMES TO A CERTAIN PLACE AND THE MORE SO IF THAT PLACE IS NOT THE CENTER LASTLY THE TIME ITSELF IS LIABLE TO INACCURACY 3 ASON THE ROTATION OF THE PLANETS C 135 AS TO THE FIRST IT APPEARS FROM THE THREE MONTHLY PERIODS OBSERVED IN THE YEAR 1779 WHEN THE PROPER ALLOWANCES FOR THE GEOCENTRIC PLACES ARE MADE THAT THE SYDEREAL REVOLUTION OF MARS CANNOT WELL BE LESS THAN 24 H 39 5 NOR MORE THAN 24 H 39 22 BUT IF WE SHOULD DIVIDE ANY ONE OF THE THREE BIENNIAL PERIODS BY A SUPPOSED NUMBER OF REVOLUTIONS ONLY ONE MORE OR ONE LESS THAN WE HAVE DONE THE DIFFERENCE WOULD BE SO CONSIDERABLE THAT NOTHING BUT A MISTAKE IN EVERY ONE OF THE THREE MONTHLY PERIODS OF AT LEAST ONE WHOLE HOUR COULD JUSTIFY SUCH A SUPPOSITION AND THAT SUCH A MISTAKE IN THE SITUATION OF A SPOT ON MARS CANNOT HAVE BEEN MADE IN THOSE OBSERVATIONS I THINK IS EVIDENT ENOUGH FROM THE EXACTNESS WITH WHICH THEY WERE MADE AND FROM THEIR AGREEMENT WITH EACH OTHER THE SECOND CAUSE OF ERROR WHICH IS THE UNCERTAINTY IN ASSIGNING THE EXACT TIME WHEN A SPOT COMES TO THE CENTER IS OF SOME FORCE BUT IT SEEMS TO ME HIGHLY PROBABLE FROM THE MANNER IN WHICH I HAVE SEEN THE SPOTS ON MARS PASS OVER THE DISK OF THAT PLANET THAT THERE CAN HARDLY BE SO GREAT AN ERROR AS 10 IN AN OBSERVATION OF ANY REMARKABLE SPOTS COMING TO THE CENTER HOWEVER NOT BEING WILLING TO TRUST MORE TO THE EYE THAN I OUGHT TO DO I HAD RECOURSE TO THE FOLLOWING EXPERI MENT I DREW SEVERAL CIRCLES OF ONE INCH RADIUS TAKING CARE TO MAKE NO VISIBLE IMPRESSION OF A CENTER AND PLACED IN EACH A FINE POINT AT THE SEVERAL DISTANCES OF042406360848 IN TEN THOUSANDS OF AN INCH FROM THE REAL CENTER SOME TO THE RIGHT OTHERS TO THE LEFT THESE MEASURES ARE THE SINES TO RADIUS ONE OF 2 26 3 39 AND 4 52 WHICH ARE THE ARCHES A SPOT ON MARS PASSES OVER IN 10 15 20 MINUTES RESPECTIVELY I EX POSED THEM TO SEVERAL PERSONS UNACQUAINTED WITH MY DESIGNS AND FOUND THAT NOT ONE OF THEM MADE A SINGLE MISTAKE IN SAY ING WHETHER THE POINT WAS OR WAS NOT IN THE CENTER OF THE CIRCLE136 MR HERSCHELS ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS CIRCLE AND WHICH WAY IT DEVIATED FROM IT AS THE DIRECTION OF THE MOTION OF A SPOT ON MARS IS KNOWN I THOUGHT THE PERSONS WHO WERE TO JUDGE OF THE PLACE OF THE POINTS WERE INTITLED TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH THE LINE IN WHICH THEY WERE PLACED WHICH FOR THAT REASON WAS ALWAYS TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT ONLY THE POINTS THAT ANSWER TO THE EXCENTRICITY OF 15 AND 20 ARE INDEED SO VISIBLY OUT OF THE CENTER THAT I BELIEVE WE MAY SAFELY SAY THAT ANY MISTAKE IN ESTIMATING THE TIME OF A SPOT ON MARS COMING TO THE CENTER CANNOT WELL EXCEED A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AT THE OUTSIDE AS FOR THE THIRD AND LAST OCCASION OF ERROR THE TIME ITSELF I BELIEVE MY MANNER OF OBTAINING AND KEEPING IT IN THE YEAR 1779 WILL APPEAR SATISFACTORY AND MAY I THINK BE DEPENDED UPON TO A FEW SECONDS BUT THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE YEAR 1777 INDEED ARE FAR FROM HAVING THE SAME ADVANTAGE I WAS NOT THEN PROVIDED WITH AN ALTITUDE INSTRUMENT THEREFORE SET MY CLOCK BY A GOOD SUNDIAL WITH THE EQUATION OF TIME CONTAINED IN THE NAUTICAL ALMANAC AND FOUND IT TO AGREE GENERALLY TO A MINUTE OR TWO WITH THE TIME CALCULATED FOR THE ECLIPSES OF JU PITERS FIRST SATELLITE AS I DEDUCED IT FOR BATH FROM THE NAUTICAL ALMANAC HOWEVER IT WAS CERTAINLY LIABLE TO AN ERROR OF SEVERAL MINUTES THEREFORE ALLOWING NO LESS THAN 10 FOR THE CLOCK IN 1777 AND 20 FOR AN ERROR IN ESTIMATING THE SITUATION OF A SPOT IN 1779 IT WILL BOTH AMOUNT TO HALF AN HOUR THEN IF WE TAKE A MEAN OF THE THREE NUMBERS WHEREBY WE HAVE DIVIDED THE THREE BIENNIAL PERIODS WE HAVE 766 13 AND HALF AN HOUR DIVIDED BY 766 13 WILL THEREFORE GIVE US THE QUANTITY TO WHICH IT SEEMS CAN AMOUNT ALL THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE SYDEREAL DIURNAL ROTATION OF MARS WHICH IS 2 34 A NEARER APPROXIMATION TO TRUTH I HOPE TO OBTAIN AT THE NEXT OPPOSITION WHICH WILL HAPPEN ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF JULY 1781 6 I HAVEON THE ROTATION OF THE PLANETS C 137 I HAVE VENTURED TO CALCULATE THE TIMES FOR THAT OPPOSITION WHEN THE EDGE OF THE REMARKABLE DARK SPOT WILL BE SEEN NEAR THE CENTER AS IT IS IN FIGURE 23 OR WHICH IS THE SAME THING AS IT WAS THE 11TH OF MAY 1779 AT 12 H 17 THE SPOT NOT BEING VISIBLE AT THE TIME OF THE OPPOSITION I HAVE TAKEN THE NEAREST PERIOD BEFORE AND AFTER IN WHICH IT WILL PASS OVER THE DISK THERE IS HOWEVER A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH MAY MAKE THE APPEARANCE OF THE SPOT NOT QUITE SIMILAR TO THE FIGURE I HAVE DRAWN EVEN THOUGH THE ROTATIONS SHOULD PERFECTLY ANSWER AS TO THE TIMES FOR THE POSITION OF THE AXIS OF MARS BEING STILL IN SOME MEASURE UNKNOWN I COULD MAKE NO ALLOWANCE FOR A CHANGE WHICH A DIFFERENCE IN THE SITUATION OF NO LESS THAN TWO SIGNS MAY OCCASION THOUGH IN ALL PROBABILITY IT WILL NOT BE VERY CONSIDERABLE THOSE WHO ARE PROVIDED WITH PROPER TELESCOPES WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE HOW FAR THE CALCULATED TIMES AGREE WITH THE SPOTS APPEARANCE AND IT IS BY THIS MEANS I ALSO HOPE TO CORRECT AND IMPROVE THE TABLES I HAVE DRAWN UP FOR THIS PURPOSE AND FURTHER TO APPROXIMATE TO A TRUE THEORY OF THE GYRATION OF THIS PLANET NOT KNOWING THE EXACT DIFFERENCE OF MERIDIANS BETWEEN GREENWICH AND THIS PLACE I HAVE CALCULATED THE SPOTS AP PEARANCE FOR THE MERIDIAN OF BATH FROM AN ECLIPSE OR TWO OF JUPITERS SATELLITES OF WHICH BY THE FAVOUR OF THE REV MR HORNSBY I HAVE SEEN CORRESPONDENT OBSERVATIONS I SUP POSE THE DIFFERENCE CANNOT BE MUCH LESS THAN 9 WEST OF GREEN WICH AND AT THE SAME TIME I JOIN AN ACCOUNT OF THE SOLAR ECLIPSE OF THE 24TH OF JUNE 1778 WHICH MAY BE DEPENDED UPON AS A VERY COMPLEAT OBSERVATION AND MAY SERVE TO ASCER TAIN THE LONGITUDE OF THIS PLACE V O L LXXI T ECLIPSE138 MR HERSCHELS ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS C ECLIPSE OF THE SUN OBSERVED

should be addressed to the EDITOR at University Station Charlottesville Va BUSINESS communications to the PUB LISHERS THE Supreme Court of the United States in Williams v WVingo 20 Sup Ct 793 affirms the ruling of the Virginia Court of Ap peals on the question whether a ferry license granted by the County Court under Act of March 5 1840 Virginia Code of 1887 sec 1386 which forbids the granting of a license for one ferry within a half mile of another ferry constitutes a contract the obligation of which is impaired by Act of March 5 1894 authorizing the estab lishment of a ferry within the prohibited limit The Virginia Court of Appeals held that the former Act did not constitute a contract with owners of ferries established under it and this decision is approved on appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States The case is an excellent illustration of the principle that no man has a vested right in a mere rule of law THE opinion in Roehmn v Horst 20 Sup Ct 780 by Mr Chief Justice Fuller contains a masterly discussion of the mooted doctrine of anticipatory breach of contracts The defendant had entered into a contract to purchase of the plaintiff during a series of years a cer tain quantity of hops to be delivered in installments of stipulated quantities at stated periods The defendant subsequently repudiated the contract and absolutely refused to receive delivery of any install ment The court followed the English rule of which Hochster v De la Tour 2 El  B1 678 is the leading exponent and which generally prevails in America that the plaintiff in such case need not await the expiration of the stipulated period but may consider the breach of the contract as complete and sue for entire damages The opinion con tains a full review of the English decisions with a citation of numerous American authorities The leading case in opposition is Daniels v Newton 114 Mass 53019 Am Rep 384 followed in a strong opinion by the Supreme Court of North Dakota in Stanford v McGill 6 N D 536 38 L R A 760 72 N W 938 One of the grounds upon which these cases rest is that such a principle leads to the necessary result that the maturity of promissory notes and other commercial paper would be anticipated by renunciation of the promise in advance of maturity It is generally agreed however that the rule does not apply to ordinary promises to pay money since here the consideration has passed the contract is executed on one side and there is therefore no mutuality of obliga tion The other proposition upon which the adverse authorities rest is that the recalcitrant party may change his mind before the maturity of the contract during which interval there is a locus penitentiae pend ing which no damages can be suffered by the other party As said by Wells J in Daniels v Newton An executory contract ordinarily confers no title or interest in the subject matter of the agreement Until the time arrives when by the terms of the agreement he is or might be entitled to its performance he can suffer no injury or depri vation which can form a ground of damages There is neither viola tion of rights nor loss upon which to found an action The court in the principal case answers this contention most satisfactorily as shown in an extract from the opinion published elsewhere See  Notes of Cases  post The doctrine of the principal case was approved in a dictum in Burke v Shaver 92 Va 345 352 and apparently governed the de cision in James v Kibler 94 Va 165 It was also recognized obiter in Lee v Mutual etc Life Assocn 97 Va 160 and received practical application in Travellers Ins Co v Harvey 82 Va 949 under the theory of waiver of the term of the contract fixing a future date for performance A corollary of this doctrine is that where one party to a contract notifies the other that he will not perform his part of it the other has no right to thereafter proceed with the execution of the agree ment and thus enhance the damages but his remedy is to sue for the damages accrued by reason of the breach at that stage of the transaction Clark v Marsiglia 1 Denio 317 43 Am Dec 670 Davis v Bronson 2 N D 300 33 Am St Rep 783 and mono graphic note 1 Bishop on Contracts 839 It is interesting to note that in Ferguson v Wills 88 Va 136 this principle seems to have been regarded by the court as too novel for serious consideration In 1900 265 EDITORIAL266 6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Aug that case Ferguson made a contract with Wills to erect a church building and died before the work was begun Shortly after the in ception of the work Fergusons administrator served notice on Wills not to proceed further with it and that the estate of his decedent would not be responsible for any payment under the contract Wills disregarded the notice completed the building and sued the admin istrator for the contract price It was held that he was entitled to recover the contract price in full The court saying  That the ob ligation of the contract was not affected by the notice served by the administrator on the plaintiff above mentioned is too plain for discus sion If it was then all that a party to a contract has to do who wishes to rid himself of its obligation is to notify the other party not to perform his part of it and the contract is at an end But such a proposition is not sanctioned by any principle either of law or justice and connot be seriously contended for It is evident from this strong language that the court had not examined the authorities none are cited and the probabilities are that the case will not be followed when the question again arises

205 JOHN ERICSSON was a man with the best of brainpower with confidence in himself who lived at a time when the world was ripe for what he could best do He was essentially a great mechanical engineer And not only was he fortunate in the age in which he lived but he was wise in his choice of a place of residence The fate of mechanical inventions is like that of the seed in the parable the invention must fall on a proper soil and be nurtured by favor able circumstances of time and place in order to bloom into suc cess Thus Ericsson was early led from his home in Sweden to England where he found a congenial environment till the conser vatism of the English Admiralty drove him to this country He was a man accustomed to carry through to useful perfection any scheme which commended itself to his mind  and having confi dence in himself he found criticism difficult to endure He knew he was riglit in his propeller for steamvessels and quickly left the country which refused to adopt it for America where within two years the new device was in use on fortytwo vessels He knew he was right in his  Monitor and was mortified and indignant at the hesitation of the American naval board in giving him a contract for building the first of this class of warvessels His work in each of these cases was not simply the devising of a form of propelling apparatus which would be better than the old side wheel or of a form of ironclad which was the best there was at the VOL XIII No 319 time but every mechanical detail of the  Princeton  and of the Monitor received some improvement at his hands Such was the man and such was his work He had the perse verance the capacity to appreciate the importance of details and the confidence in himself which lead to success And what was his reward Doubtless he received considerable payments for much of what he did  but in the case of the  Princeton it is said the government is still his debtor and in that of the  Monitor he received only the amount due him on his contract As an inventor who supplied the government with an allimportant engine of war he received not a cent Nor would he listen to the suggestion fre quently urged on him by congressmen and others that Congress should be asked to recognize his claim and to provide for it The Legislature of New York passed a resolution thanking him for his services to the country which he insisted on freely giving and these resolutions he highly prized Ericsson is said not to have cared for money and this would certainly seem to be true The respect shown at his funeral was such as is seldom seen at that of any private citizen The streets in the neighborhood of his late residence were crowded from the early morning hours with thousands who for four hours passed through the house to pay homage to the departed genius New York is a place full of hu man beings so full that each pays little or no heed to his neigh bor yet the great respect for this man of science and of action was shown in the number and character of those who followed his remains to their restingplace in the uncovered heads as they were borne along the busy streets and in the impossibility of admitting to Trinity all that wished Ericsson was a man who could have endeared many to him but he had a strong sense of duty to his work which induced him to make few friends This final homage of the unmindful crowds of the great city was to his genius well applied PUBLIC HEALTH A PUBLIC DUTY THE address of President Charles N Hewitt at the sixteenth annual meeting of the American Public Health Association was full of suggestion and contained many valuable propositions It was entitled  Public Health a Public Duty and dealt with the organization powers and relations of local State and National boards of health In reviewing the work of the association and the progress made in sanitary science during recent years he said  As secretary of one of the oldest of the State boards Minne sota I had the honor of an election as an original member of this body and have known its history since In my own State beside I have been missionary at large and served as the organizer and counsellor of many a local board and as sanitary inspector and healthofficer as well I have seen our organizations grow from two feeble boards with illdefined powers in 1872 to over fourteen hundred united under a common code of law with largely increased powers duties and funds There is not today in Min nesota a community however small without such a board in direct communication with the State board  The State boards of health have increased from three in I873 to thirtyone in i888 Largely through their efforts popular knowledge and confidence have grown from the tentative methods of the past to the demand for and more liberal support of sanitary organization and positive work More and better legislation great sanitary engineering works andI a bountiful crop of private enter prises in the same direction are among the evidences that our field is widening and our responsibilities increasing We have seen the early examples of efficient State executive organization become a living force in many more of the States and Canada Various departments of modern science are our willing helpers Micro biology has opened up great stores of discovery and awakened great hopes which we trust may not fail We have seen the beSCIENCE ginnings of international cooperation for the crushingout of cholera yellowfever and other epidemics which must in the near future become a beneficent reality taking its place with arbitration in international disputes as the most valuable victories in our century  The first essential of any sanitary authorityDr Hewitt says is executive power and its systematic use in the regular and scrupulous performance of everyday duty as defined in the law and suggested by everyday experience This almost selfevident proposition is constantly neglected in legislation for organization and is very frequently violated by boards of health who seem to favor the popular idea that an exceptional occasion is necessary to the highest exercise of their power and infectious diseases of the classical type are their selection with a proper admixture of panic Panic is no advantage any longer if it ever was as a help to sani tary organization and work Infectious diseases are not the lead ing causes of our sickness and mortality It is only in the excep tional severity of plagues like yellowfever as it has prevailed in Florida for example that infectious disease counts the most vic tims in the sickness or death roll That epidemics prevail at all in our time and country is somebodys fault for if there is one thing more than another that modern hygiene ought to be able to do it is to forefend their attack or control them if they effect a lodgement and boards of health and healthofficers have to learn that the most public and pronounced activity after the invasion of infectious disease is no substitute for the quiet unobtrusive work which in daily faithfulness would have detected the first case and controlled its spread Another pressing need is a better classifica tion of causes of death for sanitary purposes to which should be added causes of sickness and of permanent ill health from disease At present our professional nomenclature is as vague sometimes as the popular one Cholerainfantum and heartdisease are little more accurate than  too weak to live a common popular cause of death under one year The general divisions of the English regis trargenerals tables are the best known but some of the subdivis ions are not satisfactory Isolation has become so important and efficient an aid in the control of many diseases that it is time to devise some changes in our customary methods which shall insure more thoroughness with the least interference with the liberty of the family It is a serious matter to restrain the breadwinning power of a laboring man or of his selfsupporting children and it is a still more serious matter to shut up a suspected family sick and well in a small house when the removal of perhaps a single patient might save the rest or some of them The isolation home under various names is the ideal method of us all but if we had one always available people must be educated to its use We need it most for diphtheria and scarlatina Another essential is an apparatus not too expensive or elaborate or too heavy for easy movement on wheels for disinfecting clothing bedding and the like by steam One to which steam could be supplied by the boiler of a thresherengine would serve our country districts and the same could be used where steamboilers are available else where It could be taken to the infected house charged closed and moved to the nearest available boiler connected disinfected and discharged of its contents with no danger and at trifling ex pense Still another need in this connection is a ready way of dis infecting the sickroom while occupied Its essential feature should be the removal of the infected air and dust disinfecting both as they escape and the introduction of fresh air so that quantity temperature moisture and movement may be as required by the sick but all to be clone with the most complete protection of the well The means must be easy comparatively inexpensive and available in the average houses of the laboring population The stove stovepipe or chimney affords the available means in such houses in cold weather In warm weather the open fire gas or kerosene might serve to provide the means for exhausting the foul air and introducing that of the open in its place Add to the sim plest form of apparatus the open fire or stovepipe exhaust clean liness fresh air sunlight thorough inunction and boiling water for infected clothing of the sick and attendants and you have a method almost everywhere practicable which will reduce the danger from such diseases to the minimum and the mortality as well  The very large mortality from noninfectious disease under I99 five years of age is in the light of our present knowledge no lon ger tolerable and boards of health should move now and positively for its material reduction By the last census this mortality was 437 per 000ooo of living population for the whole country while in thirtyone registration cities it was 884 per 000ooo The mortality under five years to total of all ages was given as 398 The deaths under one year were for the whole population I209 in iooo living while for the cities it was 2675 This does not tell the whole story as the statistics are estimated to fall from 5 to 30 per cent below the facts We have no means of accurately estimating the sickness rate which accompanies this mortality but may assume that it is enormous Another subject of increasing importance and which ought to receive the immediate attention of the State boards is the sanitary relation of certain diseases of animals as communicable to man notably tuberculosis trichinosis and glanders  and the increasing possibility that diphtheria and scarlatina may belong to the same class The relations of the diseases of the cow to the influence of milk as food are attracting widespread attention and as affecting a very important infant food deserve an attentive study with refer ence to sanitary control On this subject popular and certain pro fessional opinion has as usual gone to extremes From the use and even advocacy of distillerymilk some have come to refuse the purest supply except after boiling and their foolishness has been an acceptable and pecuniary advantage to the manufacturers of the proposed  substitutes for cows milk  which fill our markets and are tried on our children The importance of the subject has resulted in making the control of infectious diseases of domestic animals one of the duties of the State and local boards of health as in Min nesota where the experiment has proven eminently successful and satisfactory 1 For the Nation and the States the most urgent lesson is organization and efficient cooperation for this last experience of the epidemic of yellowfever in Florida but adds another to the accumulated evidence of the near past that no State or province on this continent can afford to be any longer without a board of health officered by experienced men who have the confidence of the people and governments they serve supplied with unquestioned legal authority and sufficient money and provided with every recognized means for dealing directly and to the best advantage with any disease of men or domestic animals threatening or actually invading the State It must also and for the same reason have authority and funds to act with similar authorities of other States in mutual cooperation for State and national defence It will not do to forget the established fact that epidemics are now to be looked upon as evidences of the failure of public health in or ganization or administration That they occur or spread is pre sumptive evidence when properly qualified authorities exist that they neglected to take the needed measures or were unable to take them I see no escape from this conclusion except it be shown in any case that prevention or control was beyond the resources of our art  A central State authority organized and equipped as proposed will find itself unable to do efficient preventive or restrictive work without thoroughly organized local sanitary authorities in every township village and city and further each local board should have the same powers and proportionate means as the State board in the locality it serves Enforcing the common law and inde pendent in all purely local administration the local authorities should be a unit for common purposes under the State board of which the control of infectious diseases is a conceded example  There are now in the United States thirtyone State boards of health The first was organized in I869 and others as well be fore any attempt at national organization was madle Some of these boards are fully equipped with legal powers and funds for the work we have found laid out for them The rest with varying degrees of speed are coming on to the higher level necessary for efficiency and all are growing in usefulness and experience  State boards of health are established and recognized forces today and any national organization attempted must to be suc cessful be a development from them in form and function for the purpose of carrying over to the nation as a whole the sanitary succor which the best of the State boards afford to the populations MARCH 15 1889200 SCIENCE they serve A national board of health must first supply the na tional need proven to exist by the conjoined efforts of the efficiently organized State boards and fill up the full measure of that work within the national boundaries So established in the same dig nified relation to the National Government that such State boards bear to the governments of the several States it is prepared to perform the twofold duty beyond our borders which results from our present knowledge of the modes of approach and attack of in fectious diseases It must protect the nation first by a thorough knowledge of the character location and movements of such diseases abroad  second by preventing by the bestknown methods the shipping to this country of infected persons animals or things third by insisting upon competent sanitary service on board ship with the best facilities for preventing controlling and crushing out any form of infection discovered on the passage out fourth by providing that the sanitary authority at the port of entry shall be fully informed of what is known of the sanitary history of the ship and her lading up to the date of arrival with later telegraphic report from the American consul and health officer at the port of departure if necessary  It is a fact that today if it will our government may learn all that is here proposed by locating competent healthofficers at the foreign shipping ports whence our greatest danger comes and might keep the seaboard quarantine authorities fully posted in these important particulars As to those local authorities it is time to call a halt in the criticism of their work till all sides in the controversy can be heard or better still till healthofficers of in land States can visit and see for themselves Until the State boards agree in organization and powers and in proper relations to local boards the reorganization of the National Health Service upon a sufficient and permanent basis will be difficult if not im possible THE RESOURCES OF THE NYASSA REGION EAST COAST OF AFRICA FOR a number of years two English companies have been carry ing on a profitable trade in the Nyassa and Tanganyika region which however has recently suffered a severe check by the upris ing of the Arabs against European influence In a recent number of the Journal of the Manchester Geographical Socizety Messrs James Stevenson and E ONeill consul of this district give some interesting reports on the state of affairs and on the resources of this country from which and from some observations of other travellers we take the following notes Mr Stevensons paper is accompanied by an interesting sketchmap reproduced here show ing the extent of the ravages of the slavetrade and the caravan routes in this region The map will be of interest as supplement ing the general map of Africa showing the extent of the slave trade published in Science of Dec 28 I888 The produce of the Nyassa region and the methods of trading are well described by Mr ONeill First in importance among the objects of trade is ivory To this most valuable of all exports  putting aside for the present any possible supply of minerals trade must chiefly look for an immediate return on its capital Perhaps there are no better elephanthunting fields in Central Af rica than the great marshes of the Shire River and on the west coast of Lake Nvassa The supply from these might he largely in creased to the benefit of trade the country and the people generally The Arab slavedealer is the chief collector of ivory in this country with the tusks of which he loads his slaves obtaining thereby cheap and profitable carriage to the coast The British trader upon the Nyassa obtains but a fraction of the whole amount col lected  just so much as the Arab chooses to part with to enable himself to renew his supply of bartergoods and to resume his collection in the interior While the operations of the British trader on the Nyassa are confined to his station on the shores of the lake he plays the dignified rdle of a storekeeper to Arab traders where they may renew their store and be relieved of a journey to the coast Much has been said of the check given to the slavetrade by the takingup of the ivory on the Nyassa from the hands of the Arab collector thus obviating the necessity for slavecarriage to the VOL XIII No 319 coast But it is certain that a very slight blow is struck by this means at the slavetrade Little good will really be effected until the collection in the interior is also carried out by the whites and the Arab trader is undersold and thus peacefully ousted from the collectingfield The British trader has every advantage on his side Watercarriage should place his goods upon the Ny assa cheaper than they can be carried there overland by the Arabs who have also to contend with the high percentage exacted from them for advances by the Indian trader of Zanzibar or Mozam bique Next in importance to ivory must be placed Indiarubber in which the country west of Nyassa stretching towards Lake Bang weolo is undeniably rich but comparatively little is collected as the natives know little of the value of the plant and have never been taught to collect it Its export might probably be indefinitely increased by the same means which would help to extend the ivorytrade There are many other products indigenous tothe country but few of those known are able to bear the present cost of carriage to the markets When the country comes to be better known the number of more valuable products will be undoubtedly increased Consul ONeill says in regard to this point  How completely valuable products may remain hidden until some chance brings them to light I can instance by the case of Stroinhantus KIombe of which some specimens were sent by me to the Foreign Office in I88i A demand for it as a drug for heartdisease shortly after sprung up and its existence in this country having been thus proved I was able to start its collection in the Shire and Nyassa districts and in the Gaza country The first consignment home proved to be so valuable to the collectors that soon a rush was made to collect it and the natives were quickly taught to bring down the pods in large loads In the same manner we may hope other valuable products will come to light and more profitable ex ports found than the oilseeds which now form the staple articles of production on the coast and the lower Zambezi and Shire Riv ers To estimate justly the probable development of this region it must be remembered how slow and gradual has been the development of trade on the African coast When the British Indian traders to whom a little more than a century ago the Portuguese viceroy of India granted a monopoly of the trade of East Africa arrived on

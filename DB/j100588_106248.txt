FYNNEY AN INGENIOUS SURGEON WHO IS SETTLED AT LEEK IN STAFFORDSHIRE HE DE SIRES THAT IT MAY BE LAID BEFORE THE ROYAL SOCIETY AND I SHALL THINK MYSELF MUCH OBLIGED BY YOUR COMPLIANCE WITH HIS REQUEST READ APRIL 10 1777 TOMR FYNNEYS ACCOUNT C 459 T O D R P E R C I V A L LEEK S I R MARCH 10 1777 UPON MAY 16 1775 BEING DESIRED TO VISIT ANN DAVENPORT A NATIVE OF THIS TOWN I BEHELD A TRULY MI SERABLE OBJECT WITH THE MOST CADAVEROUS COUNTENANCE I HAD EVER SEEN EMACIATED TO THE LAST DEGREE BY A HECTIC FEVER AND PROFUSE COLLIQUATIVE SWEATS SHE HAD A CON TINUAL THIRST HER APPETITE WAS TOTALLY GONE AND SHE WAS ALWAYS IN THE EXTREMES OF BEING TOO LOOSE OR TOO BOUND HER MOTHER INFORMED ME THAT SHE WAS THEN IN HER TWENTYFIRST YEAR AND THAT SHE HAD BEEN A STRONG AND SPRIGHTLY CHILD FROM HER BIRTH UNTIL SHE WAS ABOUT FIVE YEARS OF AGE FROM WHICH TIME SHE HAD BEEN A STRANGER TO HEALTH AND EVERY NOW AND THEN HAD BEEN SEIZED WITH EXCRUCIATING FITS OF THE COLIC ESPECIALLY WHENEVER SHE ATE OR DRANK ANY THING THE LEAST ACID THE YOUNG WOMAN TOLD ME THAT ABOUT A YEAR AGO SHE HAD FIRST PERCEIVED A SWELLING ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HER BELLY JUST ABOVE THE GROIN WHICH IF AT ANY TIME SHE ATTEMPTED TO STRETCH OUT HER THIGH GAVE HER INEX PRESSIBLE PAIN AS IF SOMETHING STABBED HER IN THAT PART O O O 2 THAT460 MR FYNNEYS ACCOUNT OF THAT THEREFORE SHE WAS ALWAYS OBLIGED TO KEEP UP HER KNEES MORE OR LESS TOWARDS HER BREAST BY WHICH MEANS SHE HAD IN SOME DEGREE LOST THE POWER OF EXTENDING HER LIMBS I ORDERED HER TO TAKE HALF A DRACHM OF POWDERED BARK IN A LITTLE RED PORT WINE EVERY FOUR HOURS AND AS MATTER HAD ALREADY FORMED WITHIN THE TUMOR I DESIRED THAT A MATURATING POULTICE MIGHT BE APPLIED EVERY NIGHT AND MORNING FOR I IMAGINED THAT NATURE WITHOUT SUCH ASSISTANCE COULD NEVER BRING THE ABSCESS TO A HEAD IN HER WEAK CONDITION JULY 10TH THE MATTER POINTING AT THE UPPER END OF THE TUMOUR VERY NEAR THE OS ILIUM I MADE A LARGE OPEN ING FROM WHICH WAS DISCHARGED AN AMAZING QUANTITY OF PUS BUT AS THE TENSION WAS STILL GREAT I APPLIED A LINSEED POULTICE OVER THE COMMON DRESSINGS NEVERTHELESS IN A FEW DAYS A SECOND ABSCESS BEGAN TO FORM TOWARDS THE VER TEBRAE OF THE LOINS BETWEEN THE FALSE RIBS AND THE OS ILIUM WHICH WAS RAPID IN ITS PROGRESS FOR IT WAS BROUGHT TO MATURATION AND OPENED ON THE 26TH ON THE 31ST I WAS ALARMED WITH A GANGRENOUS AP PEARANCE OF THE WHOLE INTEGUMENTS OF THE ABDOMEN FOR THIS SHE TOOK ONE DRACHM OF POWDERED BARK IN REDPORT EVERY THREE HOURS BUT AS VESICATIONS AND EVERY SYM 1 PTOMTHE CASE OF ANN DAVENPORT 461 PTOM OF A SPHACELUS CONTINUED TO INCREASE I

LARGELY LEFT THREE HOLES AT NEARLY EQUAL DISTANCES ONE FROM ANOTHER BETWIXT THE FIRST OPENING AND THE LEFT OS ILIUM BESIDES SEVERAL ONES IN DIF FERENT PARTS OF THE BELLY BUT AS THE DISCHARGE WAS IMMO DERATE I LOOKED UPON THE PATIENT TO BE IN THE UTMOST DANGER HOWEVER THE SAME COURSE WAS PERSEVERED IN AND AT THE LATTER END OF AUGUST ANOTHER ABSCESS APPEARED LOWER DOWN TOWARDS THE RIGHT GROIN I ORDERED IT TO BE POULTICED AND LEFT IT TO OPEN OF ITSELF WHICH IT DID ON THE 21ST OF SEPTEMBER I WAS IMMEDIATELY CALLED TO HER AND462 MR FYNNEYS ACCOUNT OF AND UPON CAREFULLY EXAMINING THE PART I FOUND A HARD SUBSTANCE DEEPLY SEATED WHICH I DIRECTLY EXTRACTEDA IT WAS MAKING ITS WAY TOWARDS THE INTEGUMENTS FROM THE EXTREMITY OF THE APPENDIX VERMIFORMIS OF THE CAECUM WHICH PROBABLY AND FORTUNATELY BY FORMER INFLAMMA TIONS HAD ADHERED TO THE PERITONAEUM THE LARGE END CAME FIRST AND THE SMALL END WAS WITHIN THE APPENDIX VERMIFORMIS OF THE CAECUM AT THE TIME I TOOK IT OUT FOR IMMEDIATELY UPON THE EXTRACTION SOME EXCREMENTS FOL LOWED AND AMONG THEM SOME DARK BROWN PARTICLES WHICH I DISCOVERED TO BE FILINGS OF IRON WHICH THE PATIENT HAD FORMERLY TAKEN IN A LARGE QUANTITY AS SHE HAD NEVER BEEN REGULAR LIKE OTHER WOMEN ON A CAREFUL EXAMINA TION I FOUND SOME OF THESE FILINGS QUITE REDUCED TO RUST A SEE PLATE IX THE FIGURES 1 AND 2 ARE DIFFERENT VIEWS OF THE EXTERNAL SURFACE OF THIS IRREGULAR SUBSTANCE AND OF SO MUCH OF ITS NUCLEUS AS PROJECTS OUT OF THE ROUND PART EXACTLY AS BOTH APPEARED ON BEING TAKEN OUT OF THE BODY THE WHOLE WAS OF A DUSKY BROWN COLOUR AND HAD A GREAT RESEMBLANCE TO A SMALL SHRIVELLED PEAR FIG 3 IS A SECTION OF THE ROUND PART WHICH SEEMED TO BE FORMED OF FINE FIBROUS SUBSTANCES CLOSELY CEMENTED TOGETHER BY AN EARTHY MATTER AND OF THE PEG OF CRABTREE WOOD ITS NUCLEUS THIS FIGURE LIKEWISE SHEWS HOW FAR THE PEG WENT IN AND ALSO AN INCRUSTATION OF STONY MATTER UPON IT THE NUCLEUS I BELIEVE IS THE SMALLER END OF THAT PART OF A SILK ENGINE CALLED A STAR AT WHICH MACHINE THE PATIENT HAD BEEN EMPLOYED BEFORE SHE WAS FIVE YEARS OF AGE THEREFORE IT MUST HAVE BEEN LODGED AT LEAST SIXTEEN YEARS WITHIN THE APPENDIX VERMIFORMIS OF THE CAUCUM AS SHE REMEMBERS NOTHING OF SWALLOWING IT AND AS DURING THAT COURSE OF YEARS SHE HAD FREQUENTLY BEEN AFFLICTED WITH THE SEVERE COLICS BEFOREMENTIONED BUTTHE CASE OF ANN DAVENPORT 463 BUT STILL RETAINING THEIR FORM AS THEY CAME FROM UNDER THE FILE SOME FAECES CAME THROUGH THIS LAST WOUND DAILY FRE QUENTLY MOST COPIOUSLY AND SOMETIMES THOUGH THE EX TERNAL ORIFICE WAS LARGE BY BEING CONFINED WITH THE DRESSINGS THEY INSINUATED THEMSELVES BETWEEN THE INTE GUMENTS OF THE ABDOMEN AND CAME THROUGH THE OTHER OPENINGS ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF FEBRUARY 1776 THE DISCHARGE OF THE EXCREMENTS BY THESE OPENINGS WAS SEN SIBLY DIMINISHED AND THE WOUNDS WERE ALL HEALED EXCEPT ONE BY THE LATTER END OF THE YEAR THROUGH WHICH A SMALL QUANTITY OF EXCREMENTS STILL CONTINUE TO PASS NOW AND THEN HER HEALTH IS WITHIN THIS SHORT TIME SURPRIZINGLY IMPROVED SHE IS NOW VERY FLESHY AND STRONG HAS HAD THE CATAMENIA AND I HAVE THE GREATEST REASON TO EXPECT THAT SHE WILL BE PERFCTLY CURED STRICT REGARD WAS ALL ALONG PAID TO THE NONNATURALS AS THE CASE ABOVE IS A VERY UNCOMMON ONE I PREVAILED ON THE REVEREND MR ROGERS MINISTER OF THIS PLACE TO VISIT THE PATIENT ALONG WITH ME AND HE WAS SO FULLY SATISFIED OF THE TRUTH OF

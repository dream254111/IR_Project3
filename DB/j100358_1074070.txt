Diincker Vol IV  in the lower valley of tlhe Nile on the banks of the Euphrates and Tigris and along the coast and on the heights of Syria that independelnt forms of intellectual and civic life grew up in the ancient world By the side of the early civilizations of Egypt and the Semitic races we filnd forms of culture developed among races very differ ent in their nature and temperament The MedoPersian civiliza tion is much later than the Egyptian or the Semitic but the branch of the Aryan race which crossed into India may claim an antiquity for civilized forms of life second only to that of Egypt and China I consider that the leading characteristic both of the Egyptian and Semitic national religions was their externality In some of the highest utterances of Egypt we find spiritual insight and doubtless in many meditations of the higller priesthood which have not been preserved we should have found that they occupied common ground with the seers of all ages The Semitic family have through Hebrew prophets and hymnwriters admitted all who choose to follow them within the vail Notwithstand ing it is true that the recotgnized religion of both these races was an external and superstitious system The spirituality of religion was lost in ceremonial and the ethics of the moral code was lost in external observances All externality is super stition it matters not what form it takes Even in its very highest form it is in truth but an elevated and beautified fetichism With superstition comes fear and the awe of arbitrary ullseen powers pro duces slavish minds In like manner in their political relations both Egyptian and Semite were slaves rather than subjects On ward development was impossible save by the introduction of a new principlethat of spiritual liberty which wherever it exists moulds political forms and social relations Christ alone cal niake nations free It is the living unity of the religious idea with moral ideas which alone lifts religion out of the category of superstition When we pass from the Egyptian and Semitic territories to the home of the Aryan races we feel like travellers ascending from moThe History of Early Education notonotis plains to a cool and invigorating tableland The region south of the Caspian which is still spite of recent scepticism re garded as the original seat of the Aryan or IndoEuropean race sent its Persian and Hindu emigrants to the southeast and successive waves of Kelt Sclave Teuton and Hellene to the north and west It is a striking fact that the spirit of this vigorous race could not sustain itself on the plains of India The Hindus succumbed to the influences of nature which were too great and overwhelm ing to admit of the free growth of the personality of man These influences developed characteristics in the Hindus akin to much that we find in the Egyptian and Semite and accordingly we shall speak of them before we ascend to the clearer atmosphere of the Persian hills where it is pleasing to think the true Aryan spirit which we inherit first manifested itself INDIA AND THR HINDUS It is apparent enough from the preceding chapters on educa tional history that it is quite impossible to give anything ap proaching to a correct view of what constitutes tle education of a people without first putting before the reader an outline of the peoples civilization And civilization resolves itself into the religious and moral conceptions of nations and their political or at least social organization At the same time to treat of the characteristics of a nations life and civilization in detail is to forget the precise object of the educational historian and even to obscure it Such a brief account of a people and their special activities as is essential to the understanding of the education which tradition and environment unconsciously gave to all the members of it is sufficient This must always be followed by a statement of the means the State more or less consciously took to bring up their children to maintain and perpetuate the ilational life if ally record of this remain When we approach the education of a country like ancient India or rather that portion of it which was Hindu we are at once met by the great and allinfluencing social fact of Caste Of this we may be certain as I have before pointed out more than once that wlierever in ancient times there was a distinct sacer dotal order or caste the higher education of the country is practically the education of that caste Even in Europe this was the case up to the I2th century With the rise of the 669The School Review universities rose the differentiation of the professions and it was by destroying sacerdotalism that Protestantism gained the kingdom of knowledge and culture for the people as a whole All are priests all are equal in the sight of God this was the new or rather the revived doctrine In Egypt the priestly order and in India the priestly caste included what in modern times we call the faculties of Law and Medicine nay even sometimes also the departments of Architecture and Music It thus comprehended all the learning of the time In so far as instruction outside this circle is met with it was in those cotuntries of a very slight and perfunctory character and aimed chiefly at putting in the hands of a limited portion of the people the neces sary mercantile arts of reading and writing and elementary arithmetic All else is the education of apprenticeship to arts an education in itself however of no mean character although not aiming at the education of mind as mind The idea of the education of the man and not of the technical ist first arose definitely with the Hellenic races among whom there was no sacerdotalism It was lost sight of however from the end of the third century till tlle fifteenth crushed out by the sacerdotal and monastic ideas The education of the man as opposed to the education of the technicalist is what we mean by a  liberal  education Even in China the education is not liberal The idea of culture is not imbedded in the system the aim is prac tical and technical the selection of men for the profession of administator the qualification being substantially a mastery of the old teachings scriptures and history and customs of China In these days there is a disposition throughout the civilized world of Europe and America to return to what are essentially barbarous conceptions and to educate chiefly with a view to technical results All arts and professions will suffer from this tendency if it gains the upper hand We must aim at producing the most capable men if in the struggle for national existence we are to hold our own Pericles according to Thucydides saw this clearly Indeed we may regard Pericles oration as an educational treatise of great value for statesmen The earliest civilization of India may be embraced within 2000 to 1400 B C the period of plastic traditions and of the Vedic hymns which contained the earliest religious and philosophic teach 670The History of Early Education ing of the nation The precise date of the earliest Vedic hymns it is impossible to fix with certainty but we cannot put them later than 1200 B C The second Epoch when these hymns were gathered up compiled and extended comes down certainly to the time of Buddha if not further During this period the Caste system arose Although Buddha was born in the 6th century B C the settle ment of the Buddhist scripture was not accomplished till 242 B C when the true Buddhist period may be said to begin The Sankya philosophy of which the leader was Kapila and which was rationalistic and agnostic is assigned to the eightli or seventh century B C It freely criticised the whole Brahmanical system and laid the foundation of a theory of knowledge Gautama Buddha founder of Buddhismn lived as I have said in the sixth cen tury B C The strictly Buddhist  period runs from 242 B C to 500 A D when the Brahmanical religion again gained ascendancy Then we have the Mahommedan conquest in II94 The Code of Manu in its present form cannot be put earlier than the 5th cen tury B C Williams but we must remember that the tradi tional knowledge which it contains is of much earlier date and handed down orally The RigVeda knowledge of thanksgiving is a collection of poems in ten books hymns and invocations which had descended in priestly families and had been the growth of cen turies From early Vedic timesI suppose we may say from 2000 years before Christ there was a tradition of learning and religion which we may call the tradition of the priesthood just as there was a tradition in every other occupation These things of course along with law and custom gave education to every young citizen everywhere  but we do not know at what time and in what circumstances educational institutions were organized for the priest hood nor to what extent they were taken advantage of by the people The most recent book written too by a Hindu is vague and un satisfactory and as deficient in true imagination as in dates like most of oriental products Dutts Civilization of Ancient India It would appear however that prior to 000o B C or about that date the courts of the more enlightened kings were the cen tres of such learning as existed Priests were of course in attend ance at the palaces of the various ruling princes and in connec tion with them there grew up what might be called schools Me gasthenes who lived in India three centuries B C and indeed all 671The School Review the Greeks speak of the Brahmanic Priests as the caste of philos ophers There also arose Brahinanic settlemenlts called Parishads which approximate closely to a collegiate institution of learning These Parishads were in later times understood to consist of twentyone Brahians wellversed in philosophy tlieology alld law but in their beginnings and about the date we are now speak ing of three able Bralhmans in a village learned in the Vedas and competent to maintain the sacrificial fire constituted a Parishad Dutt 1249 To these centres men who wished to devote their lives to learning and who belonged to the caste might go and re ceive instruction in the Vedas and in such law and astronomy and philosophy as was current Private schools also it would appear arose conducted by schol arly men at their own venture and to these many boys were sent for training giving personal and menial service in return for in struction And these boys did not necessarily belong to the Brah manical caste When the Caste system arose I400 to iooo B C it largely determined the area as well as the character of the edu cation By Caste we mean that the natural divisions of the peo ple were authoritatively fixed and made hereditary These divis sions were into priests including wise nlen anld legislators war riors including executive administration  merchanits including all industrial members of the community who employed labor and laborers One of the Hindu legends is that tlle supreme caste of Brahmans proceeded out of the mouth of Brahmnathe warrior and executive caste Kshatryas or Chuttrees out of tlle armsthe mercantile Vaisyas or Bais from the thigh and the servile class or Sudras from the foot Besides these tlere is a still lower class if not caste called Pariah in Southern India and Chandalas in other districts The Sudras and the other lowest caste are understood to have been the aborigilal inllabitants of India prior to the Aryan Hindu invasion and conquest Mixture of Castes was lnot absolutely forbidden but it en tailed and still entails disadvantagesespecially on the children The strict system of Caste lias except in the case of the Brah mans gradually been now much broken up and Castes within Castes are formed whicli indeed are little more than associations And indeed it would appear that the Caste organization was never so iron as has been sometimes represented although the Brahmans 672The History of Early Education naturally did all they could to perpetuate it The humblest member of the lowest caste might attain to union with Brahma and this fact must have largely influenced the way il which the castes regarded each other The following verses from the great Sanskrit Epic the MahaBharata are in this relation interesting They are however the expression of the postBuddllistic re formed Brallhanisiim THE PATH OF SALVATION A spirit Yaksha asks What is it makes a Brahman Birth Deep study sacred lore or worth  King Yudhishthira answers Nor study sacred lore nor birth The Brahman makes tis only worth All mena Brahman most of all Should virtue guard with care and pains Who virtue rescues all retains But all is gone with virtues fall The men in books who take delight Frequenters all of learnings schools Are nothing more than zealous fools The learns are those who act aright More vile than one of Sudra race That Brahman deem whose learned store Embraces all the Vedic lore If evil deeds his life disgrace That man deserves the Brahmans name Who offerings throws on Agnis flame And knows his senses how to tame But a caste system however it may be modified by a common hu manitarian religious sentiment necessarily restricts the area of education Passing from this to the substance or material of education among the ancient Hindus we have now as always to ask the question what was the Hindu philosophy of life  This deter mines the education of a people except in so far as it is industrial education Now it is difficult to generalize the philosophic and re ligious idea of a nation without falling into inadequacy if not  Translated by Dr J Muir 673The School Review error and it is all the more hazardous to do so when we have to do with an nation which has speculated on the problems of life for 2000 or 3000 years In the earlier Vedic thought we find characteristics which connect the primitive religion of the Hindus with the MedoPersian which found finally its highest expression in Zoroastrianism But the climatic influence of India told on the primitive genius of the people and as Brahmanisin developed we find in it elements wholly antagonistic to the Zoroastrian individualism and the continual contest between light and darkness good and evil which that religion teaches Philosophy and religion moreover have had in India their history and developmenet as well as elsewhere But after a certain date we find that through the whole there runs one general governing con ception Except in so far as it is agnostic it is pantheistic and the practical effects of tlie panthleistic temperament are visible for tlle highest moral aiml of the Hindu is not selfsacrifice in the sense of the sacrifice of all to the duties of this life which is the true Christian idea but it is rather tlle abnegation of life itself with a view to the absorption of the individual into the  All The blessed personal immortality of some of the Vedic hymns ceased to be an operative faith The idea of perfect reposea re pose amounting to the death of personality largely influenced daily life This was the nIatural outcome of their metaphysi cal dreamy and imaginative religious philosophy Before the AllOne the particular and the individual are in truth of no mo mentmere passing shows Such an idea if rooted into the na ture of a people is an effective check to all personal activity weakens all sense of individual responsibility and what may be called the ambition of virtue Even the daily duties of life are not done as the act of a free individual seeking thereby tlle good of others and the growth of himrself in virtue For the idea of fatalism though it may not find formal expression necessarily constitutes the undercurrent of the lives of men whose concep tions of the end of life are such as we have indicated Wuttke very well says that people of a strong personality pray  thy Kingdom come the Chinese pray  May thy Kingdom re main  the Indians  May that which thou hast created perish  that is to say May all existence be swallowed up in being It may be said that this is the Buddhistic conception  but in trutl the most abstract form of Brahmanlisml which contemplates ab 674The History of Early Education sorption in Brahman has the same essential characteristics as Buddhism Notwithstanding the interposition of intermediate states the doctrine of transmnigration and the natural breaking up of pantheism into numerous and popular local divinities the ultimate destiny of the soul must have had a powerful effect on the character of the Hindus The following verses sum up fairly well the supreme thought of the genuine Hindu priestphilosopher THE PRIEST OF BRAHMAN TO HIS DYING DISCIPLE  Boy  to fear death which only means That body and soul twin life in bonds Part and go forth their several ways  But I no longer am my individual self dissolved  That may be so  and yet if so it be What then  Thy soul goes gladly forth To mix with God sole Beingand live in Him Yielding its tribute to Universal Mind A spirit atom in the Eternal One Serving the more high destiny  to swell The bliss of Being which alone can be   This pleasing body to the grave so grim   Not so Say rather to the arms the kindly arms Of gracious mother earth from whence it sprang Who turns it quick into her vital sap That it may pass into a million forms And live in all the beauty of this world No longer but a part as now but interfused And dwelling in the life of grass and trees Made glorious in the budding flowers of Spring Melting into the green of tidal caves Rolling in thunder and the ocean storm Gracious and tender in the light of eve And splendid in the rise and set of suns For Soul and Body such the rapturous end In the popular form both of Brahmanism and Buddhism all sorts of corruptions have arisen it is scarcely necessary to say superstitions and idolatries abound The ethical virtues of a people whose views are essentially pantheistic are as might be expected temperance peaceableness 675The School Review patience docility gentleness and resignation These are accom panied by politeness which is the natural protection of peaceable ness among men respect for parents and elders and loyalty to the powers above them Duty in our commanding sense of that word and the virtues flowing from a strong personality are not distinctive marks of the Hindu The end of the highest education is thus expressed in Manus Book of LawsTo learn and to understand the Vedas to practise pious mortifications to acquire divine knowledge of the Law and of Philosophy to treat with veneration his natural and his spiritual Father i e the Priestthese are the chief duties by means of wllich endless felicity is attained  The Laws which were collected and written under the name of Manu were of great antiquity but their formulation does not date back prior to 600 B C If the above brief statement fairly sums up the Hindu philosophy of life it will give us the substance and aim of Hiindu education It formed  and forms a profound contrast to that in China  The Chinese  says Wuttke educate for practical life the Indians for the ideal Those for earth these for heaven i e either for individual blessedness or absorption Those educate their sons for entering the world these for going out of it Those educate for citizenship these for the priesthood i e as the ideal of life Those for industrial activity these for knowledge Those teach their sons the laws of the state these teach them the essence of the Godhead Those lead their sons into the world these lead theml out of the world into themselves Those teach their children to earn and to enjoy these to beg and to renunciate  This is a strong way of stating the case but it has a large element of truth But the writer has omitted to note the proni nence given to certain kinds of virtue and to social obligations generally in the ancient education of the Hindus and to which I have adverted above The ethical teaching of the Vedic hymns  I use the past tense in speaking of India but except in so far as modified by the British power native education seems to remain what it was It has also to be noted that the Mahommedans who preceded the British in India have their own schools and colleges 676The IHistory of Early Education was as pure as that of the Jewish prophets Though not enforced by a like definite divine sanction yet on the other hand there was greater inner moral freedom in their system and less of mere externality In this respect as in his more profound philosophy the Hindu vindicated his Aryan ancestry This is substantially true spite of the multitude of ceremonial acts which the Brahman ulti mately imposed on the people the reaction against which so power fully aided the new teachiiig of Buddha in the sixth century B C The earliest education in India consisted essentially of precepts and moral warnings conveyed often through fable Accordilngly it was at every stage essentially ethical The Religion was ritualistic that is to say an education of religious ceremonies Hiaving spoken thus generally let me now indicate the specific education of the Castes so far as known I The Brahmans as guardians of religion as supporters of the arts and sciences as counsellors of those who govern as judges or physicians were instructed in all the learning of India of which they were themselves the exclusive conservators 2 The second caste of Warriors Wlhich also includes the executive power were exercised in arms from their seventh year upwards 3 The third or Industrial caste were instructed in trades and the elements of agriculture and of mercantile affairs by their parents or masters A small proportion of these learned to read and write at venture scliools but at what date writing was brought in to aid the universal reliance on memory does not ap pearcertainly not if we believe Megasthenes till after 300 B C 4 The Sudras learned nothing They did the menial work of the nation Special care was always devoted to the higher schools of the Brahmans and the course of instruction extended over a long series of years These existing from the earliest times in some form or other developed in the course of time into important col leges In the schools at Benlares Frizine and NNuddeah instruc tion was given in grammar history and mathematics to those who though not Brahmans yet belonged to the second and third castes The Brahmanical caste had in addition instruction in poetry his tory philosophy astronomy the medical art and law But the 677Thle School Review highest instruction of the Brahmanical caste consisted in the study of the Vedas and tile commenltaries on them and included also the code of Manu So much had to be learned by heart that the higher education was an immense strain onl the memory We may say then generally speakicg of ancienlt and even pre Mahommedan India that the Brahmanical class alonie received the higher or even what we should call secondary  education A certain small proportion of the Kshatrya and Vaisya caste obtained some kinowledge of grammar poetry and mathematics But these two castes and even the fourth caste might all it would appear obtain if they desired it and took steps to provide a teacher more or less instruction in reading writing and aritlhmte tic and in those moral and religious duties which are conveyed through the reading books But education was never a matter of national organization or concern Megasthenes says 3oo B C that writing was not known among the Indians But this though incorrect is yet evidence that it was not in colmmon use and that education must have beeii oral The female sex was excluded from instruction but in quite the earliest times it was not so So strong was the prejudice against the education of women that the power to read and write was gen erally regarded as a reproach the only exception was in the case of the dancing girlsthese latter being the daughters of parents of various casteswho are devoted when young to the service of the templet Those who desire to read these must perform various ceremonies and wash themselves It was the custom at the beginning and end of every hour of instruction to embrace the feet of their instructor and they had to read with folded hands Only those they hold whose heart and speech are ever pure and attentive can elljoy the full fruit of the study of the Vedas It was considered a great offence to study the Vedas without the consent of an authorized instructor tAs servants of the temple and maidens of the God they had to culti vate their intelligence mothers of households on the contrary their heart only lest they should be drawn away by intellectual cultivation from do mestic duties The female servants of the temple are instructed in reading writing music dancing and singing Their duties are to sing the praises of the God they serve and to dance on festive occasions They were divided into two classesthe better class being confined within the temple and re stricted to temple services the second and lower class being allowed greater freedom and permission to perform at marriage festivities and the great banquets of the Nobility 678The History of Early Education Some of the school books are full of fable and contain some ex cellent educational utterances Their oldest collection of fables is called the  Pantschatantruti  but this is not preChristian it dates from the fifth century after Christ and was translated in the sixth century into Persian under the name of Thle friend of knowledge then from Persian into the Arabic from the Arabic into the Greek Turkish Syriaxi Hebrew Spanish Italian En glish and French and German In that book we find such utter ances as the following and when we cotlsider that the book is full of fable and allegory and consider fuirther thle style of the follow ing extracts we become alive to the spirit that animates Hindu life and education  As the tree shades the man who is about to cut it down and as the moon shines in the hut even of the lowliest Chandala so must a man love those who hate him Be humble for the tender grass bows itself unhurt before the storm while mighty trees are shattered to pieces by it  Virtue after which mlan ought to strive needs a mighty effort for a cocoa nut falls not through the shaking of a crow  A knowledge of arms and learning are both equally very famous but the first is in an old man folly the second is worthy of honour at every period of life A man without knowledge is undistinguished though lie possess youth and beauty and high birth He is like Kihnssae flowerwithout sweet odour  Education is higher than beauty and concealed treasures It accom panies us on our journey through strange places and gives us inexhaustible strength  The wise man must strive to gain knowledge and wealth as if he were not subject to death but the duties of religion he must fulfil as if death were hovering already on his lips  Like as figures on a new Vase are not easily washed out so is it with wisdom which is stamped upon the mind of youth through the charm of fable Such are some of the sentiments on which the Indian youth was rearedall conveyed through a mass of fable and allegory and given by the hands and under the sanction of the sacred order of the Brahmans to the few who sought it India was a dreamland The motive in giving instruction at all would seem to have been the teaching of submission and of the ordinary precepts of kindly intercourse No effort no ambition no virile ideal was possible under the Hindu system All that in so far as it exists now is an alien importation and truly a sort of masquerading in British clothes that will never fit 679The School Review The rise of Buddhism 600 years before Christ though virtually in its principles destructive of caste does not seem to have altered the conditions of Indian education A reformed Brahmanism drove Buddhism out of India To sum up the highest lifeaim of the educated Hindu mind was abstraction from tlle things of this world and philosophic and religious contemplation This also I have said was the highest aim of all education The foundation of the intellectual life was the sacred Vedic books and the Laws of Manu Philosophies arose out of these As regards the masses of the people a certain small proportion acquired the elements of reading writing and arithmetic when writing became conmmon and books could be had and through their instructors they were taught moral and religious precepts Their remaining education and the education of the great mass was outside the specific technical industries of each simply the education which the religion ceremonies traditions laws and above all the domestic and village life of their coun try gave them But through the whole there unquestionably ran a genuine ethical spirit and a spirit of obedience and devotion to powers seen and unseen MethodsAs regards Method there is little to be said Before the introduction of writing the pupil learned by rote from the recitation of the master a laborious and prolonged process And when they had books they were read aloud until they were known by heart without being necessarily understood Thus receiving of tradition from the lips of a master was necessarily the form of all teaching and the attitude of the learner was slavish acceptance Thils notion of instruction was characteristic of the Oriental gen erally and still is so The elementary schools adventure schools were like many in ancient Greece and Italy held in the open air the pupils sitting round the teachers under trees in front of a house and in bad weather in a covered shed In arithmetic only the merest elements were taught Writing with which instruc tion in reading was closely connected was first practiced in the sand then with an iron style on palm leaves and finally on planetree leaves with a kind of ink But all this belongs to the period after the birth of Christ In the school it was a common practice for one child to point out the letters to another They 680The History of Early Education also heard each other their lessons It was thus largely a system of mutual instruction Dr Bell took his monitorial system from what he saw at Madras The discipline was gentle and only in the extremest cases was there any severity Manu says Good instruction must be given to pupils without unpleasant sensations and the teacher who reverences virtue must use sweet and gentle words If a scholar is guilty of a fault his instructor may punish him with severe words and threaten that on the next offence he will give him blows and if the fault is committed in cold weather the teacher may dowse him with cold water The education of India by Great Britain can of course teach us little which is not better taught by the system of instrnction in our own country It is simply an attempt to plant British education in a foreign soil It is an exotic The native dialects are taught and natives largely employed This British system is based on a despatch of Sir Charles Wood dated Igth July I854 The main principle of the despatch was that European knowledge should be diffused through the languages understood by the great mass of the people but that the teaching of English should al ways be combined with careful attention to the study of the ver nacular languages With regard to the wealthier classes it was declared that the time had arrived for the establishment of univer sities in India conferring degrees and based on the model of the University of London They were not to be places of education but to test the value of education obtained elsewhere and to con fer degrees in arts law medicine and civil engineering Such universities have accordingly been established in Calcutta Madras and Bombay and since 1859 Government schools have been opened for the instruction of all classes of the Indian people In each province there is now a director of public instruction as sisted by school inspectors one of whom has under his care one circle or subdivision of the province There are also Colleges both Government and Missionary which prepare for the univer sity examinations Normal schools for the training of teachers have also been established and attempts are being made to spread female education It is stated in Chambers Cyclopaedia I892 that there are in all I34000 educational institutions of one kind or another in India S S Laurie University of Edinburgh  Chambers

ed  184 In Bowne v Wolcott I N Dak 415 419 the court in discussing this theory limited its application to cases of a total breach where nothing passed to the grantee by the deed Other cases hold that the judgment estops the grantee from setting up the deed as a conveyance of lands against the grantor Parker v Brown I5 N H I76 188 Bank v Mersereau 3 Barb Ch N Y 528 57I According to a third view after such a judgment the vendor is entitled to a reconveyance twhich equity will decree Park v Cheek 4 Cold Tenn 20 28 Recohs v Younglove 8 Bax Tenn 385 Shorthill v Ferguson 47 Iowa 284 In Vermont it is the practice to stay execution on the judgment until the grantee executes a quitclaim deed Catlin v Hurlburt 3 Vt 403 A sim ilar procedure was suggested in Ives v Niles 5 Watts Pa 323 In the principal case the court did not pass on whether the plaintiff was sufficiently protected by the judgment at law but having equity jurisdiction on other grounds proceeded to give the relief prayed for It would seem that if the grantor was not protected by the judgment at law equity would have jurisdiction to secure his protection McKinney v Watts 3 A K Mar Ky 268 It has been suggested that the point at which the grantors need of protection arises is not judgment but satisfaction Noonan v Ilsley supra Foss v Stickney 5 Greenleaf Me 390 INJUNCTION TO PROTECT RIGHT Or CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENTCom plainant joined a strike which was conducted by unlawful means at defend ants shoe factory Next day the shoe manufacturers of the same city blacklisted all employees that had taken part in the strike whereby com plainant was unaible to secure employment in any of the shoe factories He sought to enjoin the manufacturers from depriving him of the right of employment by means of a blacklist Held that the emlployee by reason of the unlawful methods in conducting the strike could not have his relief in equity but must seek his redress at law Cornellier v IHaverhill Shoe Mfrs Assn et al Mass I915 IO9 N E 643 Without discussing the conflict in the authorities of various jurisdictions the court above followed the principle that the legality of a strike depends on its purpose and on the means of maintaining it This is a question of law De Minico v Craig 207 Mass 593 94 N E 317 42 L R A N S 1048 After deciding that the strike in the principal case was illegal the court in applying the maxim that he who comes into equity must come with clean hands must necessarily have decided that plaintiffs participa tion in the unlawful strike was so closely connected with the unlawful blacklist as to be a part of the transaction sought to be enjoined McCon nell v ConnorsMcConnell Co 14o Fed 987 72 C C A 68I Kinner v Lake Shore  M S Ry Co 69 N E 614 69 Ohio St 339 Also in apply ing this maxim the court took with very little discussion equitable jurisdic tion over the right of contract of employment In Worthington v Waring I57 iMass 421 20 L R A N S 342 such injunction was denied on the ground that the right violated was a personal right and not a subject for 346RECENT IMPORTANT DECISIONS equity jurisdiction That a court of equity has no jurisdiction over a mere violation of a personal right see Burnett v Craig 30 Ala I35 Bayer et al v Western Union Telegraph Co 124 Fed 246 29 HARV L REv 93 KERR INJUNCTIONS Ist ed 12 Such violations are treated as a crime or past tort The actions of defendant in the principal case amounted to an action able wrong Blumenthal v Shaw 77 Fed 954 23 C C A 590 Willis v Muscogee Mfg Co I20 Ga 597 48 S E I77 New Cement Gun Co v McGivern 218 Mass I98 IO5 N E 885 Such actionable wrong may be the subject of injunction only when it involves a violation of a pecuniary or property right along with the violation of the personal right In re Debs I58 U S 564 15 S Ct 9oo Flacous v Smith I99 Pa St 128 48 Atl 894 The court in the principal case decided either that the right involved was a property right or that the nature of the right went to the courts discretion rather than to its jurisdiction On whichever ground this case illustrates the trend of modern decisions in extending the scope of the preventive rem edies of equity INSURANCEErEcT OF FRAUD ON WAIVER OF CoNDIrTINThe local coun cilor of the defendant mutual benefit life insurance company persuaded A a bartender to drop his other insurance and insure in the defendant com pany A knew that by the bylaws of the association bartenders were pro hibited from membership but following the advice of the local councilor he applied as a lunchroom man The application was accepted the policy issued and the premiums paid The laws of the company incorporated in the policy provided that no waiver of a condition could be made by the local lodge or members A died and his wife sued on the policy Held that the action of A and the councilor amounted to a fraud on the fcompany and that the doctrine of Iwaiver by act of the agent would not apply and recovery was denied Klein v Supreme Council of Loyal Assn 1915 I55 N Y Supp 580 The New York courts adhere to the doctrine that a breach of a condi tion in a policy may at the inception of the policy be waived by the general agent who delivers the policy with knowledge of the breach of condition even though the policy contain a provision that no such waiver may be made by the agent Wood v Am Ins Co I49 N Y 382 Stewart v Union Met Life Ins Co I55 N Y 257 Skinner v Norman 165 N Y 565 The contrary view is generally regarded as the weight of authority holding that the agent is prevented from waiving by reason of the pro vision of the contract where the insured has knowledge of the restriction Northern Assur Co v Grand View Bldg Assn I83 U S 308 Loeffler v Modern Woodmen of Am Ioo Wis 79 Ellerbe v Faust II9 Mo 653 Lippman v Aetna Ins Co io8 Ga 39I Phoenix Ins Co v Maxson 42 Ill App 164 Mallory v Metropolitan Life Ins Co 97 Mich 416 The principal case is distinguished from the previous New York decisions on the ground that the insured knew of the restriction and that his act under the direction of the agent was a deceit upon insurer and so placed the insured in such a position that he could not claim the benefit of the waiver 347

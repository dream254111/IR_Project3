J100438,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY,1005173,DESCRIPTION OF A MACHINE FOR MEASURING A SHIPS WAY THROUGH THE SEA BY F HOPKINSON ESQ,I241954,NO XL DEJFCRIPTION OF A MACHINE FOR MEAFURING A SHIPS WAY THROUGH THE SEA BY F HOPKINSON EFQUIRE RELADI JULY H E ERRORS AND UNCERTAINTIES INCIDENT TO THE II I783  MARINIERS LOG IN COMMON UFE ARE TOO OBVIOUS NOT TO BE UNIVERFALLY ACKNOWLEDGED WERE IT NOT FOR THE OBFERVATIONS NAVIGATORS ARE ACCUFTOMED TO MAKE OF A FHIPS PROGREFS BY THE APPARENT PAFFAGE OF THE WATER ALONG FIDE AND THE FIGNS THAT UFUALLY PREFENT ON APPROACHING THE LAND THE LOG ALONE WOULD BE A VERY UNFAFE DEPENDENCE SEVERAL ATTEMPTS HAVE THEREFORE BEEN MADE TO IMPROVE THE LOG AND RENDER ITS INDICATIONS MORE ACCURATE BUT WITH OUT FUCCEFS ALL THE MACHINES OF THIS KIND THAT I HAVE HEARD OF WERE COMPOFED OF A NUMBER OF WHEELS WHICH WERE TO BE PUT IN MOTION BY THE TWIFTING OF A LINE LET OUT AFTERN HAVING A DRAG AT THE END FO CONFTRUATED AS TO WHIRL ROUND FAFLER OR FLOWER ACCORDING TO THE MOTION OF THE FLIP THE OBJEAFIONS TO A MACHINE FO CONFLRUATED ARE FIRJL IF THE LINE IS NOT VERY LONG THE DRAG WILL BE CONFIDERABLY AFFEATED BY THE FHIPS WAKE AND IF IT IS VERY LONG THE TWIFTINGS WILL BE IRREGULAR AND THE LINE LIABLE TO KINK SECONDLY IF THE DRAG IS FO HEAVY AS TO FINK BELOW THE BOT TOMS OF THE WAVES WLHEN THE FHIP FAILS FAFT IT WILL BE TOO HEAVY AND FINK TOO DEEP WHEN FHE HATH BUT A FLOW PRO GREFFIVE MOTION OR OTLHERWIFE IF THE DRAG IS OF A PROPER WEIGHT WHEN FHE MNAKES BUT LITTLE WAY IT WILL FKIP FROIN WAVE TO WAVE THROUGH THE AIR WHEN FHE FAILS WITH A BRIFK GALE AND FO BE OF NO UFE AND THIRDLY IT WILL BE LIABLE TO MOAI OF THE OTHER IRREGULARITIES TO WHICH THE LOG IN CONIMON UFE IS EXPOFED Y Z THEX6O MACHINE FOIR MEASURING A THE MACHINE NOW PROPOFED WILL IT IS HOPED BE FREE FROM AT LEAFT FOME OF THEFE OBJEFAIONS AND ALTHOUGH IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO AFCERTAIN A FHIPS WAY THROUGH THE FEA TO A MATHEMATICAL PRECIFION YET IF IT FHOULD BE FOUND TO ANFWER THE PURPOFE BETTER THAN ANY INFIRUMENT HITHERTO CONTRIVED IT MAY BE ADMITTED AS AN ACQUIFITION TO THE ART OF NAVIGATION THIS MACHINE IN ITS MOFT FIMPLE FORM IS REPREFENTED BY FIG I PLATE 3 WHEREIN AB IS A FIRONG ROD OF IRON MOVE ABLE ON THE FULCRUM C D IS A THIN CIRCULAR PLATE OF BRAFS RIVETTED TO THE LOWER EXTREMITY OF THE ROD E AN HORIZON TAL ARM CONNEAED AT ONE END WITH THE TOP OF THE ROD AB BY A MOVEABLE JOINT F AND AT THE OTHER END WITH THE BOTTOM OF THE INDEX H BY A LIKE MOVEABLE JOINT G H IS THE INDEX TURNING ON ITS CENTRE I AND TRAVELLING OVER THE GRADUATED ARCH K AND L IS A FTRONG FPRING BEARING AGAINFT THE ROD AB AND CONFTANTLY COUNTERAATING THE PREFFURE UPON THE PALATE D THE ROD AB IHOULD BE APPLIED CLOFE TO ONE FIDE OF THE CUT WATER OR FLEM AND IHOULD BE OF FUCH A LENGTH THAT THE PALATE D MAY BE NO HIGHER ABOVE THE KEEL THAN IS NECEFFARY TO FECURE IT FROM INJURY WHEN THE VEFFEL IS AGROUND OR FAILS IN FHOAL WATER AS THE BOW OF THE FLIIP CURVES INWARD TOWARDS THE KEEL M THE PALATE D WILL BE THROWN TO A DIFTANCE FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE VEFFEL AL THOUGH THE PERPENDICULAR ROD TO WHICH IT IS ANNEXED LIES CLOFE TO THE BOW ABOVE AND THEREFORE THE PALATE WILL BE MORE FAIRLY AATED UPON THE ARM E HOULD ENTER THE BOW FOMEWHERE NEAR THE HAWFER HOLE AND LEAD TO ANY CONVENIENT PLACE IN THE FORECAFILE WHERE A FMOOTH BOARD OR PLATE MAY BE FIXED HAVING THE INDEX H AND GRADUATED ARCH K UPON IT IT IS EVIDENT FROM THE FIGURE THAT AS THE HIP IS URGED FORWARD BY THE WIND THE PALATE D WILL BE PREFFED UPON BY THE REFIFLING MEDIUM WITH A GREATER OR LEFS FORCE ACCORD ING TO THE PROGREFFIVE MOTION OF THE FHIP AND THIS WILL GPERATE UPON THE LEVERS FO AS TO IMMEDIATELY AFFET THE II DEX MAKING THE LEAFT ENCREAFE OR DIMINUTION OF THE HIPS WAYS H I PS WAY WAY VIFIBLE ON THE GRADUATED ARCH THE FPRING L ALWAYS COUNTERAAING THE PREFLLRE UPON THE PALATE AND BRINGING BACK THE INDEX ON ANY RELAXATION OF THE FORCE IMPREFFED A FHIP GOING THROUGH THE FEA OPENS A PAFFAGE FOR LHER FELF MAKING A HOLE IN THE WATER EQUAL TO HER IMINERGED BULK AS FHE PAFRES ON THIS VACANCY IS FILLED UP BY THE TUMBLING IN OF THE WATERS FROM EACH FIDE AND FROM UN DERNEATH AT THE FTERN WITHL GREAT VIOLENCE SO THAT THERE IS A FAIR CURRENT OF WATER FROM HER BOW TO HER FLERN PAF FING UNDER THE BOTTOM AND ALONG FIDE  THE FORCE OF WHIICLH CURRENT IS IN DIREA PROPORTION TO THE VELOCITY OF THE FHIPS PROGREFFIVE MOTION THIS MACHINE IS THEREFORE ADVAN TAGEOUFLY PLACED AT THE BOW OF THE FIHIP WHERE THE CURRENT FIRFT BEGINS AND AATS FAIRLY UPON THE PALATE IN PREFERENICE TO THE RERN WHERE THE TUMULTUOUS CLOFING OF THE WATERS CAUFES A WAKE VIFIBLE TO A GREAT DIFLANCE THE PALATE D IS FUNK NEARLY AS LOW AS THE KEEL THAT IT MAY NOT BE INFLU ENCED BY THE HEAPING UP OF THE WATER AND THE DAFHING OF THE WAVES AT AND NEAR THE WATERLINE THE ARCH K IS TO AFCERTAIN HOW MANY KNOTS OR MILES FHE WOULD RUN IN ONE HOUR AT HER THEN RATE OF FAILING BUT THE GRADUATIONS ON THIS ARCH MUFT BE UNEQUAL BECAUFE THE REFIFTANCE OF THE FPRING L WILL ENCREAFE AS IT BECOMES MORE BENT FO THAT THE INDEX WILL TRAVEL OVER A GREATER FPACE FROM ONE TO FIVE MILES WHICH I FUPPOFE TO BE A MEDIUM THAN FROM FIVE TO TWELVE LAFILY THE PALATE ROD FPRIILG AND ALL THE METALLIC PARTS OF THE INFIRUMENT FHOULD BE COVERED WITH A FTRONG VARNIFH TO PREVENT RUFT FROM THE CORROFIVE QUALITY OF THE FALT WATER AND FEA AIR IMPROVEMENT OF THIS MACHINE LET THE ROD OR FPEAR AB FIG I BE A ROUND ROD OF IRON OR REEL AND INFTEAD OF MOVING ON THE FULCRUM OR JOINT AS AT C LET IT PAFS THROUGH AND TURN FREELY IN A FOCKET TO WHICH FOCKET THE MOVEABLE JOINT MUFT BE ANNEXED AS RE PREFENTEDI62 MACHINE FOR MEASURING A PREFENTED IN FIG 2 THE ROD MUFF HAVE A FHOULDER TO BEAR ON THE UPPER EDGE OF THE FOCKET TO PREVENT ITS FLIPPING QUITE DOWN THE ROD MUFF ALFO PAFS THROUGH A LIKE FOCKET AT F FIG I THE JOINT OF THE LOWER FOCKET MUFT BE FIXED TO THE BOW OF THE FHIP AND THE UPPER JOINT OR FOCKET MUFT BE CONNEATED WITH THE HORIZONTAL ARM E ON THE TOP OF THE UPPERMOFT FOCKET LET THERE BE A FMALL CIRCULAR PLATE BEARING THE 32 POINTS OF THE MARINERS COMPAFS AND LET THE TOP OF THE ROD AB COME THROUGH THE CENTRE OF THIS PLATE FO AS TO CARRY A FMALL INDEX UPON IT AS IS REPREFENT ED IN FIG 3 THIS FMALL INDEX MUFT BE FIXED TO THE TOP OF THE ROD ON A FQUARE  FO THAT BY TURNING THE INDEX ROUND THE PLATE THE ROD MAY ALFO TURN IN THE FOCKETS AND OF COURFE CARRY THE PALATE D ROUND WITH IT THE LITTLE INDEX ALWAYS POINTING IN A DIREEAION WITH THE FACE OF THE PALATE THE FMALL COMPAFS PLATE FHOULD NOT BE FAFTENED TO THE TOP OF THE FOCKET BUT ONLY FITTED TIGHTLY ON THAT IT MAY BE MOVE ABLE AT PLEAFURE SUPPOFE THEN THE INTENDED PORT TO BEAR FOUTHWEFT FROM THE PLACE OF DEPARTURE  THE PALATE MUFT BE TURNED ON THE FOCKET TILL THE FOUTHWEFT POITNT THEREON LOOKS DIREATLY TO THE FHIPS BOW FO THAT THE FOUTHWEFT AND NORTHEAFT LINE ON THE COMPAFS PLATE MAY BE PRECIFELY PA RALLEL WITH THE FHIPS KEEL AND IN THIS POFITION THE PLATE MUFT REMAIN DURING THE WHOLE VOYAGE SUPPOFE THEN THE LHIP TO BE FAILING IN THE DIRED COURFE OF HER INTENDED VOY AGE WITH HER BOWFPRIT POINTING FOUTHLWEFT LET THE LITTLE ILNDEX BE BROUGHT TO THE FOUTHWEFF POINT ON THE COMPAFS PLATE AND THE PALATE D WILL NECEFFARILY PREFENT ITS BROAD FACE TOWARD THE PORT OF EFTINATION AND THIS IT MUFF AL WAYS BE MADE TO DO BE THE HIPS FAILING COURFE WHAT IT MAY IF ON ACCOUNT OF UINFAVOURABLE WINDS THE LHIP IS OBLIGED TO DEVIATE FROM HER INTENDED COURFE THE LITTLE IN DEX MUFF BE MOVED FO MANY POINTS FROM THE FOUTHWEFF LINE OF THE COMPAFS PLATE AS THE COMPAFS IN THE BINNACLE HALL FHEW THAT HIE DEVIATES FROM LHER TRUE COURFE SO THIAT IN WHATEVER DIRECCTION THE HIP HALL FAIL THE PALATE D WVILL ALWAVSSHIPS WAY 163 ALWAYS LOOK FULL TO THE FOUTHWEFT POINT OF THE HORIZON OR TOWARDS THE PORT OF DEFTINATION AND CONFEQUENTLY WILL PREFENT ONLY AN OBLIQUE FURFACE TO THE REFIFLING MEDIUM MORE OR LEFS OBLIQUE AS THE FHIP DEVIATES MORE OR LEFS FROMN THE TRUE COURFE OF HER VOYAGE AS THEREFORE THE REFIFT ANCE OF THE WATER WILL OPERATE LEFS UPON THE PALATE IN AN OBLIQUE THAN IN A DIREAT POFITION IN EXAAT PROPORTION TO ITS OBLIQUITY THE INDEX H WILL NOT FHEW HOW MANY KNOTS THE VEFFEL RUNS IN HER THEN COURFE BUT WILL IT IS EXPEDED INDICATE HOW MANY FHE GAINS IN THE DIREA LINE OF HIER IN TENDED VOYAGE THUS IN FIG 5 IF THE IHLIPS COTURFE LIES IN THE DIREAION OF THE LINE AB BUT IHE CAN FAIL BY THE WIND NO NEARER THAN AC FUPPOFE THEN HER PROGREFFIVE MOTIORN FUCH AS TO PERFORM AC EQUAL TO FIVE KNOTS OR MILES IN ONE HOUR YET THE INDEX H WILL ONLY POINT TO FOUR KNOTS ON THE GRADUATED ARCH BECAUFE THE GAINIS NO MORE THAN AT THAT RATE ON THE TRUE LINE OF HER VOYAGE VIZ FROM A TO B THUS WILL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HER REAL MOTION AND THAT POINTED OUT BY THE INDEX BE ALWAYS IN PROPORTION TO HER DEVIATION FROM THE INTENDED PORT UNTIL THE FAILS IN A LINE AT RIGHT ANGLES THEREWITH AS AD IN WHICH CAFE THE PALATE WOULD PREFENT ONLY A THIN FHARP EDGE TO THE REFILLING ME DIUM THE PREFFURE OF WHICH IHOULD NOT BE FUFFICIENT TO OVERCOME THE FRIDFION OF THE MACHINE AND THE BEARING OF THE FPRING L SO THAT AT WHATEVER RATE THE FHIP MAY FAIL ON THAT LINE YET THE INDEX WILL NOT BE AFFEDED SHEWING THAT THE GAINS NOTHING ON HER TRUE COURFE IN THIS CAFE AND ALFO WLHEN THE VEFFEL IS NOT UNDER WAY THE ADRION OF THE FPRING L IHOULD CAUFE THE INDEX TO POINLT AT O AS REPRE FENTED BY THE DOTTED LINES IN FIGURE I AND 4 AS THE TRUTH OF THIS INITRUMENT MUFT DEPEND ON THE EQUAL PREFFURE OF THE REFIFLING MEDIUM UPON THE PALATE D ACCORDINGR TO THE FLIIPS VELOCITY ANID THE PROPORTIONABLE ADCION OF THE FPRING L THERE FHOULD BE A PIN OR FCREW AT THE JOINTS C AND F FO THAT THE ROD MAY BE READILY UNFLIP PCD AND TAKEN IN IN ORDER TO CLEAN THE PALATE FROM ANY FOUL LUEFS164 MACHINE FOR MEASURING A FOULNEFS IT MAY CONTRAT WHICH WOULD GREATLY INCREAFE ITS OPERATION ON THE INDEX H AND THEREBY RENDER THE GRADU ATED ARCH FALFE AND UNCERTAIN FURTHER THE FPRING L MAY BE EXPOFED TOO MUCH TO IN JURY FROM THE FALT WATER IF FIXED ON THE OUTFIDE OF THE FHIPS BOW TO REMEDY THIS IT MAY BE BROUGHT UNDER COVER BY CONFLRUATING THE MACHINE AS REPREFENTED BY FIGURE 4 WHERE A B IS THE ROD C THE FULCRUM OR CENTRE OF ITS MO TION D THE PALATE E THE HORIZONTAL ARM LEADING THROUGH A FINALL HOLE INTO THE FORECAFILE M IS A FTRONG CHAIN FAFT ENED AT ONE END TO THE ARM E AND AT THE OTHER TO A RIM OR BARREL ON THE WHEEL G WHICH BY MEANS OF ITS TEETH GIVES IMIOTION TO THE FEMICIRCLE I AND INDEX H THE FPRING L IS IPIRAL AIND ENCLOFED IN A BOX OR BARREL LIKE THE MAIN FPRING OF A WATCH A FINALL CHAIN IS FIXED TO AND PAFLING ROUND THE BARREL IS FAFTENED BY THE OTHER END TO THE FUZEE W RHIS FUZEE IS CONNEALED BY ITS TEETH WITH THE WHEEL G AND COUNTERATTS THE MOTION OF THE PALATE D NN ARE THE TWO FOCKETS TLHROUGHI WHICH THE ROD A B PAFFES AND IN WHICH IT IS TURNED ROUND BY MEANS OF THE LITTLE INDEX R S IS THE IFMALL COMPAFS PLATE MOVEABLE ON THE TOP OF THE UPPER FOCKET N THE PLATE S HATH AN UPRIGHT RIM ROUND ITS EDGE CUT INTO TEETH OR NOTCHES FO THAT WHEN THE INDEX R IS A LITTLE RAIFED UP IN ORDER TO BRING IT ROUND TO ANY INTENDED POINT IT MAY FALL INITO ONE OF THEFE NOTCHES AND BE DETAINED TLHERE OTHERWIFE THE PREFFURE OF THE WATER WILL FORCE THE PALATE D FROM ITS OBLIQUE POFITION AND TURN THE ROD AND INDEX ROTUND TO THE DIREAION IN WHICH THE FHIP HALL BE THEN FAILING SLHOULD IT BE APPREHENDED THAT THE PALATE D BEING PLACED FO FAR FORWARD MAY AFFED THE FHIIPS FTEERAGE OR OBFLRUA HER FAILING IT FHOULD BE CONFIDERED THAT A VERY FMALL PLATE WILL BE FUFFICIENT TO WORK THE MACHINE I IFHOULD FUPPOFE THAT ONE OF THREE OR FOUR INCHES IN DIAMETER WOULD FULLY ANFWER THE PURPOFE AND YET NOT BE LARGE ENOUGH TO HLAVE ANY FENFIBLE OPERATION ON THE HELM OR FHIPS WAY THES H I PS W A Y I65 THE GREATEFT DIFFICULTY PERHAPS WILL BE IN GRADUATING THE ARCH K IF THE MACHINE IS CONFLRUATED AS IN FGURE I THE UNEQUAL DIVIFIONS OF WHICH CAN ONLY BE AFCERTAINED BY AAUAL EXPERIMENT ON BOARD OF EACH HIP REFPEDIVELY IN AS MUCH AS THE ACCURACY OF THEFE GRADUATIONIS WILL DEPEND ON TLHREE CIRCUMFIANCES VIZ THE POFITION OF THE FULCRUM C WITH REFPEA TO THE LENGTH OF THE ROD THE FIZE OF THE PALATE D AND THE FTRENGTH OR BEARING OF THE FPRING L WHEN THEFE GRADUATIONS HOWEVER ARE ONCE AFCERTAINED FOR THE MACHINE ON BOARD OF ANY ONE VEFFEL THEY WILL NOT WANT ANY FUTURE ALTERATIONS PROVIDED THE PALATE D BE KEPT CLEAN AND THE FPRING L RETAINS ITS ELAFTICITY BUT THE UNEQUAL DIVIFLONS OF THE GRADUATED ARCH WILL BC UNTNECEFFARY IF THE MACHINE IS CONFTRUIAED AS IN FIGURE 4 FOR AS THE CHAIN GOES ROUND THE BARREL L AND THEN WINDS THROUGH THE FPIRAL CHANNEL OF THE FUZEE W THE FORCE OF THE MAINFPRING MUFT OPERATE EQUALLY OR NEARLY FO IN ALL POFITIONS OF THE INDEX AND CONFEQUENTLY THE DIVIFIONS OF THE ARCH K MAY IN FUCH CAFE BE EQUAL AFTER ALL IT IS NOT EXPE6LED THAT A FHIPS LONGITUDE CAN BE DETERMINED TO A MATHEMATICAL CERTAINTY BY THIS INFTRU MENT THE IRREGULAR MOTIONS AND IMPULFES TO WHICH A FHIP IS CONTINUALLY EXPOFED MAKE FUCH AN ACCURACY UNAT TAINABLE PERHAPS BY ANY MACHINERY BUT IF IT FHOULD BE FOUND AS I FLATTER MYFELF IT WILL ON FAIR EXPERIMENT THAT IT ANFWERS THE PURPOFE MUCH BETTER THAN THE COMMON LOG IT MAY BE CONFIDERED AS AN ACQUIFITION TO THE ART OF NAVIGATION IT FHOULD BE OBFERVED THAT IN AFCERTAINING A FHIPS LONGI TUDE BY A TIMEPIECE THIS GREAT INCONVENIENCE OCCURS THAT A FMALL AND TRIFLING MIFIAKE IN THE TIME MAKES A VERY GREAT AND DANGEROUS ERROR IN THE DIFLANCE RUN WHEREAS THE ER RORS OF THIS MACHINE WILL OPERATE NO FARTHER THAN THLEIR REAL AMOUNT WHICH CAN NEVER BE GREAT OR DANGEROUS IF COR RECED BY THE UFUAL OBFERVATIONS MADE BY MARINERS FOR COR REDING THE COMMON LOG A LIKE MACHINE MADE IN ITS FIMPLE FORM AS AT FIG I FO CONFTRUDED AS TO CHIP AND UNFHIP MIGHT OCCAFIONALLY Y BEI66 A C C O U N T OR TIHE BE APPLIED ALONG FIDE ABOUT MNIDFIIPS IN ORDER TO AFCCR TAIN THE LEEWAY WHICH IF RIGHTLY ILHEWN WILL GIVE THE FHIPS PRECIFE LONGITUDE AS TO FEACURRENTS THIS AND ALL OTHER MACHINES HITHERTO INVENTED MUFF BE FUBJEA TO THEIR INFLUENCE AND PROPER ALLOWANCES MUFT BE MADE ACCORD ING TO THE FKILL AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE NAVIGATOR LAFLY FOME DIFCRETION WILL BE NECEFFARY IN TAKING OB FERVATIONS FROM THE MACHINE TO BE ENTERED ON THE LOGBOOK I MEAN THAT THE MOFF FAVOURABLE AND EQUITABLE MOMENT FLHOULD BE CHOFEN FOR THE OBFERVATION NOT WHILFT THE FHIP IS RAPIDLY DEFCENDING THE DECLIVITY OF A WAVE OR IS FUD DLENLY CHECKED BY A FIROKE OF THE FEA OR IS IN THE VERY AA OF PLUNGING IN ALL CAFES I FUPPOFE PERIODS MAY BE FOUND IN WHICH A IHIP PROCEEDS WITH A TRUE AVERAGE VELOCITY TO DIFCOVER WHICH A LITTLE EXPERIENCE AND ATTENTION WILL LEAD THE FKILFUL MARINER  AN INGENIOUS MECHANIC WOULD PROBABLY CONFTRUD THIS MACHINE TO BETTER ADVANTAGE IN MANY REFPECTS THE AUTHOR ONLY INEANT TO FUGGEFT THE PRINCIPLE  EXPERIMENIT ALONE CAN POINT OUT THE BEFT METHOD OF APPLYING IT HIE IS ENFILBLE OF AT LEAFL ONE DEFICIENCY VIZ THAT THE LITTLE INDEX R FIGURE 4 WILL NOT BE IFRONG ENOUGH TO RETAIIN THC PALATE D IN AN OBLIQUE POFITI ON WHEN THE IHIP IS FAILING BY THE WIND NIORE EFPECIALLY AS THE CONPAFS PLATE S IN WHOFE NOTCHLED RIM THE INDEX R IS TO IALL IS NOT FIXED TO BUT ONLY FITTED TIGHT ON THE FOCKET N MANY MEANS HOWEVER MIGHT BE CONTRIVED TO REMEDY THIS INCONIVENICNCECD    7C

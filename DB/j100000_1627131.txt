lard D Johnson U S G S read a paper on  Subsidence Basis of the High Plains  and DrC Willard Hayes U S G S one on the  Lake Re gion in Central America  Dr Hayes paper was based upon observations made recently in Cen tral America while working under detail as geologist to the Nicaraguan Canal Commission Abstracts of both papers follow Subsidence Basins of the Hgh PlainsThe Great Plains structural slope has been super ficially modified by streams from the Rocky Mountains in thr6e stages of gradationa first stage in which a hardrock topography was de veloped by degradation a second in which this topography by aggradation became buried under an alluvial waste sheet to depths within its valleys as great as 300 feet the third and present stage in which the mountain streams are again engaged in cutting and have trenched the aggradation plain with parallel valleys wide apart But left thus above grade this flat surface in the greater part has been eroded also by the drainage from its local precipita tion In notable exception is a transverse mid slope belt Here the flat surface suffers no erosion from its local precipitation and has vir tually no local drainage It therefore stands in light relief Transected by the mountain streams into broad plateaus of faint elevation it forms a belt of residual tables or upland flats of survival The Staked Plains plateau of north western Texas constitutes the best individual example These are the High Plainsto some extent locally socalled The Great Plains slope has a graduated climatefrom humid to arid east tb west The High Plains correspond in position to its  subhumid  belt In the arid belt to the westward the vegeta tionof grass and brushgrows in tufts It affords but slight protection against the feeble precipitation and the surface is conspicuously eroded Upon the High Plains within the sub humid belt however vegetation is wholly of grass which forms a universal closeknit sod This vegetal cover affords complete protection against the considerable local precipitation The High Plains are distinctively the short grass country  As a residual topographic belt within the climatic belt they are held by their sod The local precipitationso much of it as does not evaporateis absorbedJANUARY 27 1899 SCIENCE 153 These uneroded tables however have a faint topography due to subsidence The flat surface is extensively pitted with saucerform depres sions Their dimensions vary from a foot or two in depth and a breadth of 100 feet to 75 teet in depth and a breadth of two or three miles Wind action is plainly to be excluded Occasionally they are surrounded upon the hard sod flats by concentric cracks deep enough to cause injury to cattle and to entrap calves These forms large and small without differ ences in type are attributed to the operation of two distinct and unrelated processes 1 set tlement and compacting within the deep and unconsolidated mass of silt sand and gravel through instrumentality of the groundwater and 2 solution of salt and gypsum and conse quent caving within the rocks of the floor where those rocks are the Red Beds The concurrence of two unusual causes to produce alike within a limited area a result so unusual appears however to be intelligible on this assumption viz These processes are in fact of universal operation they are at the same time of too light effect to stand a chance in competition with erosive agency but the sodcovered subhumid plains remarkable in that they retain a flat surface unscored by erosion afford exceptional opportunity for the preservation of their delicate record The Lake Region in Central AmericaThe region described includes southern Nicaragua and northern Costa Rica extending from 10 degrees and 30 minutes to 12degrees and 30 minutes north latitude and from the Carribean to the Pacific It includes the route of the pro jected Nicaragua Canal and the largest lakes of the western hemisphere south of the glaciated region of North America The region is char acterized by two types of topography viz 1 the recent volcanic ranges and plateaus in which the original constructional forms are more or less perfectly preserved  and 2 the areas of Tertiary igneous and sedimentary rocks in which the drainage is mature and the forms are due to long continued subaerial erosion A note worthy feature is the absence of any continuous mountain range or chain of dominant peaks through this portion of the isthmus A shallow depression occupies the western portion of the region its longer axis being nearly parallel with the Pacific coast This contains Lakes Nica ragua and Managua The former is 110 miles in length with an area of 3000 square miles and a mean altitude of 106 feet Its greatest depth is 200 feet The climate of the region is tropical and in sular the annual range of temperature being small The rainfall is greatest on the east coast nearly 300 inches at Greytown and decreases somewhat uniformly westward being less than 80 inches on the west coast Connected with the decrease in the rainfall there is a striking change in the character of the vegetation the dense tropical jungle of the east coast giving place to open forests and savannahs in the west No rocks older than the Tertiary are formed along the line of the canal They consist of eruptive and sedimentary formations the former including basalt andesite and dacite and the latter calcarious sandstones and shales In ad dition to these Tertiary rocks there are exten sive recent alluvial deposits and the tuffs and lavas of the modern volcanoes The conditions throughout the region but particularly in its eastern portion are favorable for rock decay and the regolith is unusually extensive The late geologic history of the region is briefly as follows In early Tertiary time this portion of the isthmus may have been wholly submerged At any rate marine sediments were deposited throughout a considerable part of its extent and this was accompanied by intense volcanic activity In middle Tertiary time there was an uplift and long continued erosion the constructional volcanic topography being obliterated and the region at least toward the south being reduced to one of low relief The present basin of Lake Nicaragua was then occupied in part by a gulf connected with the Pacific to the northwest and in part by the valleys of tributary streams The conti nental divide then occupied the hilly or moun tainous region east of the lake crossing the present San Juan valley near Castillo In late Tertiary or postTertiary time the isthmus was elevated at least 300 feet and deeply dissected Following the elevation was a renewal of vol canic activity  A series of vents opened on the154 SCIENCE N S VOL IX No 213 Pacific side and their ejecta built a dam across the outlet of the gulf thereby forming the lake basin As this dam increased in height the waters behind it were raised until they over topped the continental divide and escaped to the Atlantic forming the present San Juan The region has suffered a recent depression by which the rivers were drowned and their estu aries thus formed have since been silted up WM F MORSELL

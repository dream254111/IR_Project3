the other half of a 1 mm sheet of aluminum a pinhole photograph of this double plate will show that the sheet of platinum emits a far greater number of Xrays than does the aluminum sheet this remark applying in either case to the side upon which the cathode rays impinge From the reverse side of the platinum however practically no Xrays are emitted but from the reverse side of the aluminum a relatively large number are radiated It is easy to con struct an explanation of this observation still it is to be recommended that before so doing we should learn a little more about the characteristics of Xrays It must be mentioned however that this fact has a practical bearing Judging by my experience up to now platinum is the best for generating the most powerful X rays I used a few weeks ago with excel lent results a discharge apparatus in which a concave mirror of aluminum acted as cathode and a sheet of platinum as anode the platinum being at an angle of 45 deg to the axis of the mirror and at the center of curvature  21 The Xrays in this apparatus start from the anode I conclude from experi ments with variouslyshaped apparatus that as regards the intensity of the Xrays it is a matter of indifference whether or not the spot at which these rays are generated be the anode With a special view to re searches with alternate currents from a Tesla transformer a discharge apparatus is being made in which both electrodes are concave aluminum mirrors their axes be ing at right angles at the common center of curvature there is a  cathoderay catch ing sheet of platinum As to the utility of this apparatus I will report further at a later date W K RONTGEN 72U BEHA TIOR OF SUGAR TOWARDS RONTGEKf RAYS THE fact that sugar is transparent to Xrays was ascertained at an early date after R6ntgens announcement of his mo mentous discovery It seemed however of interest to learn whether the structure of the sugar traversed by the rays might exercise any influence on the rays or modify their action on photographic plates Through the courtesy of Prof M I Pupin of Columbia University who kindly extended the privileges of his laboratory to the writer the following tests were made Two plates of sugar were selected The one was a disk 16 mm thick sawed from a titlar a titlar is made by pouring a magma of best white refined sugar into a cone shaped mould washing well with pure white sugar liquor and then baking the mass perfectly dry and hard This disk was therefore practically a solid agglom eration of pure sucrose crystals The other disk was made by dissolving perfectly pure white sugar in water evaporating to a cer tain consistency and then casting the mass in a copper ring This disk also measured 16 mm in thickness it was a perfectly clear and transparent solid of a yellow color and consisted of amorphous sugar candysocalled barley sugar A few preliminary trials were made by photographing with Xrays through these plates of sugarwith and without fluores cent screensvarying the time of exposure etc Finally the following experiment was carried out A photographic plate was placed in a box on the outside of which six metal disks were arranged in two groups of three each Each group consisted of a medal of alumin ium provided with figures and inscrip tions in basrelief a plain disk of aluminium and a silver quarter dollar One of these groups was covered with the crystalline the other with the amorphous MAY 15 1896SCIENCE sugar plate The Crookes tube was sus pended 61 inches above the plates and an exposure of forty minutes was given The conditions under which the two sugar plates were placed were therefore identical and the results obtained compara ble On developing the photographic plate it was found that both sugar plates had permitted the Xrays to pass through suffi ciently freely to form clear and well defined pictures of the metallic disks The figures and inscriptions on the alu minium medals were discernible in both in stances and the outlines of both the alumin ium disks and of the silver coins were also well marked The negative however showed unmis takably that the amorphous sugar is more transparent to the Xrays than the crystal line modification In the former case the background proved to have an even and darker hue showing that Xrays had passed through freely and evenly In the latter case the background was less dark and of a rather mottled appearance in some places exhibiting apparently a faint outline trac ing of the crystalline structure beneath which it had rested This fact may be of interest in view of the mooted question con cerning the power of diffusion and refrac tion of the Xrays In this connection it may not be amiss to also refer briefly to some tests made to ascertain whether or no the Xrays exercise any influence on polarized light To this end a tube was made of aluminium 200 mm in length and 31 mm in diameter the walls were 2 mm thick This tube was filled successively with solutions of sucrose dextrose levulose and raffinose This tube with its contents was placed in a sugar polariscope a ray of light was per mitted to pass through the tube and the deviation of the polarized light produced by the solutions was noted The polari scope with the filled tube was then placed underneath a Crookes tube in such a man ner that the tube was directly in the path of maximum intensity of the Xrays i e in the path of the cathode rays so that the rays would pass through the tube practically at right angles to the beam of polarized light which traversed the tube longitu dinally The times of exposure given varied seven minutes for the sucrose solution ten min utes for the levulose and the raffinose solu tion and fifteen minutes for the dextrose solution but in no instance was any de viation of the ray of polarized light notice able The polarization of the solutions were Sucrose  499 Raffinose 153 Dextrose  72 Levulose  88 Of course these tests alone are not suffi cient in number or kind to permit the draw ing of any conclusive inference as to whether the Xrays influence the plane of polarized light or not but they do establish the fact that under the conditions under which these tests were made no such influence was exerted FERDINAND G WIECHMANN THE XRAYS IN MEDICINE AND SURGERY ON April 22d I succeeded in applying the Xrays to the diagnosis of disease in such a manner as to make it seem that a very wide field was open to medical as well as to surgical investigations by means of the Xray Using a focussing tube powerfully driven I found it quite possible to cause calcium tungstate to fluoresce even though a human trunk or head be interposed be tween the tube and the fluorescing screen Further it became evident that the back bone the ribs the bones of the members and the outline of the skul and of the up per portion at least of the pelvis could be 730 LN S VOL III No 72

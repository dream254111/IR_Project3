War demonstrated the necessity for re form in the War Departments methods of dealing with the impor tant problem of military transportation During that emergency there seems to have been very little real cooperation between the railroads of the country and the government It was not until July i8 I898 more than three months after war was declared that the Transportation Division of the Quartermasters Department was created and charged with the supervision and control of all rail and water transportation1 A few years after the SpanishAmerican War the Quartermas ter Generals Office and the transportation companies began to co ordinate their efforts and to work together more cordially and more effectively than in I898 In i9o5 and again in I9I2 arrangements were made regarding thehandling of troops and supplies Through out 1914 and I9I5 it seemed probable that the United States would find it necessary to intervene in Mexico and during the latter year in order to avoid the possibility of a recurrence of the conditions of I898 the officer in charge of the Transportation Division of the Quartermaster Generals Office appeared before several transporta tion associations and outlined the plan of mutual cooperation which was practically the one later put into effect On October 26 I9I5 upon the recommendation of the Quartermaster Generals Office the Secretary of War suggested that the American Railway Asso ciation establish a committee on military transportation to whom the department could look for any information that might be desired as to the railroads of the United States and with a further view to coordination between the railroads and the WVar Department in the transportation of troops and supplies of the United States2 Shortly afterwards a  Special Committee on Cooperation with the Military Authorities  was appointed by the American Railway Association and Fairfax Harrison president of the Southern Rail way was named chairman of the committee During the winter of I9I5I9I6 the committee was in frequent session with the officers 1 General Orders no I22 War Dept Aug i8 I898 2 Report of the Quartermaster General I 9 I 6  464 Troop Movements on

June i8 I9I6 the Secretary of War through the governors of the various states called into the federal service the greater part of the organized militia and of the National Guard4 The special com mittee of the American Railway Association met at once in the office of the Quartermaster General in Washington with Lieutenant Colonel Chauncey B Baker who represented the Quartermaster General and the plans formulated during the previous winter were immediately placed in effect iCompetent railway officials were placed at the headquarters of the four territorial departments of the army at each mobilization camp of the National Guard and in the office of the Quartermaster General in Washington These officials or general agents as they came to be called acted as ad visers to the officers of the Quartermaster Corps on all questions affecting the railroads Upon notification that an organization was about to leave camp for the border the camp quartermaster con sulted with the general agent at the camp telling him the strength of the organization the approximate date of departure the number and kind of cars required etc The general agent then set about assembling all railroad equipment other than tourist sleepingcars in time for the movement The assignment of tourist cars for troop movements was handled from Washington by the Transpor tation Division of the Quartermaster Generals Office assisted by a representative of the Pullman Company at the capital By the adoption of these methods the War Department and railroads alike hoped to prevent a repetition during the operations in Mexico of the congestion which occurred during the war with Spain That they succeeded is generally agreed Both the Chief of Staff and the Secretary of War commended the special committee for its splendid cooperation with the government and the President warmly congratulated the American Railway Association on its patriotic efforts5 From the beginning of the Great War in I914 many persons in

National Defense which was authorized by the Army Appropriation Act of August 29 I9I6 An Advisory Commission of the Council consisting of seven members was formed and Daniel Willard president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and chairman of the Advisory Commission was named chairman of a Committee on Transportation and Communication Its function was the organization of the transportation facilities of the country for the rapid transportation of the large bodies of troops and the enormous quantities of supplies which would be needed if the United States should enter the war6 February i6 I9I7 at the request of Mr Willard the executive committee of the American Railway Association met in New York City and decided to enlarge the Special Committee on Cooperation with the Military Authorities and to designate it as a Special Com mittee on National Defense Though not officially a part of the Council of National Defense nor of its Advisory Commission it was closely associated with the latter and was sometimes regarded as a subcommittee of the Advisory Commission Its function was the organization of the railroads for mutual cooperation and co ordination in case of emergency Fairfax Harrison who had been chairman of the Special Committee on Cooperation with the Mili tary Authorities in I9I6 was named chairman of the new committee Four district committees eastern central southern and western were established corresponding to the four military departments of the United States with whose commanding generals they were to cooperate in connection with the work of the Council of National Defense The chairmen of these district committees with Mr liarrison as general chairman constituted a special executive com mittee The new Special Committee on National Defense met in Wash ington March I I9I7 in conference with the Secretary of War and representatives of the General Staff and the Quartermaster Generals Office At this meeting Colonel Baker representing the Quarter master General presented a definite plan for cooperation between the government and the railways The railway committee on March 2 decided that the district committees should get in touch with the military commanders of their respective departments as soon as pos sible It was also decided that in case of any large troop movements the transportation should be handled under the same plan as in I9I6 The central office of the executive committee in Washington 6 First Annual Report of the Council of National Defense Washington 1917Troop Movements on American Railroads 467 was put under the charge of George Hodges a man of wide railroad experience who had been in immediate charge of the transportation of troops in I9I6 By the first of April the organization was prac tically complete The railroads were the first great industry of the United States to perfect an organization to cooperate with the mili tary authorities and to offer its services to the Secretary of War7 The emergency for which the railroads had been preparing came on April 6 I9I7 when the United States declared that a state of war existed with the imperial German government The following day the Council of National Defense directed the chairman of the Committee on Transportation and Communication to call upon the railroads to organize for the utmost despatch in the movement of freight8 In answer to the chairmans summons nearly fifty rail way presidents representing the transportation interests of the entire nation assembled in Washington April II I9I7 and resolved to coordinate their operations in a continental railway system merging    all their merely individual and competitive activi ties in the effort to produce a maximum of national transportation efficiency a To accomplish this object the railway executives empowered the American Railway Associations Special Commit tee on National Defense to formulate and direct the carryingout of a policy of operation for all the railroads The four district sub committees composing the Special Committee were increased to six to agree with the territorial departments of the army which had on April 2 been likewise increased0 Fairfax Harrison remained general chairman of the committee An executive committee of five members was chosen from the general committee and Mr Harrison was appointed chairman with authority to select the four other members Daniel Willard repre senting the Advisory Commission of the Council of National De fense and Edgar E Clark of the Interstate Commerce Commis sion were ex officio members This committee which came to be known as the Railroads War Board directed the operation of vir tually all the railroads of the United States no less than 693 rail roads controlling over 260000 miles of track and employing almost 1750000 persons agreed to carry out its orders During the sum mer and autumn of I9I7 the War Board attempted to secure higher efficiency and better utilization of the available transportation

the spring of I9I7 was probably the most important and revolutionary step taken in the history of American railways to that time By placing the operation of all their facilities under the direction of a single com mittee of five for the period of the war it constituted them with certain limitations a single continental system  At the same time it placed the services of this great railway system unreservedly at the disposal of the government    Perhaps the most significant feature of the matter was that this act on the part of the railways was purely voluntary No law required it Another of its very significant features was that the step was taken without any pros pect of especial consideration or compensation having been held out by the government  This was in decided contrast with the situa tion in Etfgland where the government at the very beginning of the war assumed control of the railroads by law While the English railroads transported troops and munitions free of charge their earnings were guaranteed by the government Subordinate to the Special Committee on National Defense and acting under the direction of its executive committee were several subcommittees The more important of these were the Commission on Car Service and the subcommittees on Military Transportation Accounting on Military Passenger Tariffs and on Military Freight Tariffs This organization thus established with permanent head quarters at Washington with its staff of experts and employees with subcommittees both in Washington and in many cities through out the country was maintained wholly at the expense of the rail roads13 The organization described above was designed to control the operation of the entire continental system of railways and it was as much concerned with the private shipper and traveller as with the government To handle the problem of troop transportation there was built up at Washington in the office of Fairfax Harrison 1 Edgar E Clark Interstate Commerce

organization known as the Troop Movement Force which was placed under the immediate direction of George Hodges as sistant to thegeneral chairman Mr Hodges had been in charge of the troop transportation for the railroads in i9i6 and the sys tem used then was expanded and adapted to the greater emergency The functions of the central bureau of the Troop Movement Force were briefly these to gather all necessary information regarding equipment needed and available to arrange for the transfer of equipment from one road or section of the country to another to expedite the return of empty cars to keep informed as to threatened conditions of congestion and to make provisions for avoiding it and generally to assist in every way practicable in the smooth oper ation of troop trains1 In time this central bureau in Washington came to be divided into three sections a routing section which ar ranged routes subject to the approval of the Quartermaster General a transportation section which controlled the arrangements for the actual movement of troops over the railroads involved and kept in touch with all that concerned troop transportation by means of daily reports from the transportation general agents and a Pullman sec tion which apportioned the available tourist cars to the various troop movements under authorization for their use from the Quarter master General Liaison between the central bureau and the War Department was maintained through an officer of the Quartermas ter Corps and a railway representative Representatives or general agents of the American Railway Association designated by the Special Committee on National Defense were stationed at each of the six departmental headquarters of the army in the office of the governor or adjutant general of each state at the headquarters of the Construction Quartermaster and at each mobilization and con centration camp cantonment and port of embarkation At each place were two general agents one reporting to the Troop Move ment Force and the other to the Military Transportation Accounting Subcommittee The latter assisted the departmental and camp quartermasters in making out transportation requests bills of lad ing and the like The former was assigned as a transportation expert and it was his duty to keep in touch with the quartermaster at his post to see that all trains and cars were provided when needed that loading was properly done and in general to translate 14 Id Bulletin no 8 Mar 27 1917 also Special Regulations no 63 War Dept Apr 20 1917470 R H McLean into terms of action the

the movements of troop trains16 December 28 I9I7 the government assumed control of the rail roads and on the thirtyfirst the members of the Railroads War Board resigned Their subcommittees were either taken over by the United States Railroad Administration or dissolved and their functions were assigned to other parts of that organization7 The Troop Movement Force however did not at once become a part of the new administration and for some months its members continued their work as before and were still spoken of as American Railway Association representatives The governments assumption of con trol over the railroads occasioned no alteration in the functioning of their organization May 24 I9I8 the Troop Movement Force became the troop Movement Section of the Division of Transpor tation of the United States Railroad Administration George Hodges who had been in charge of the work since its initiation was appointed manager and the functions of the section were defined as the arrangement

who exercised his power through the General Staff the coordinating agency of the War Department Orders once approved by the Chief of Staff were issued by the Adjutant General of the army During I9I7

supervision After orders for the movement of troops and their equipment had been issued the duty of providing the means of transportation devolved upon the Quartermaster Corps19 The Transportation Division of the Quartermaster Generals Office handled all matters pertaining to transportation whether on land or sea and through its Land Transportation Branch it supervised all movements of troops and quartermaster supplies by land20 During the early months of the war the Land Transportation Branch when advised of a projected troop movement at once notified the department and camp quartermasters concerned as to the route to be used it also informed the Troop Movement Force of the American Railway Association The latter organization then issued instructions re garding the date of the movement the assembling of railway equip ment etc to its department and camp general agents directly con cerned who cooperated with the local quartermasters in arranging the details of the movement The routing and movement of parties of fifty or less might be ordered by any officer in charge at the point of origin the movement of larger parties within a department was controlled by the department quartermaster while all inter department movements of more than fifty men were authorized at first through the Quartermaster Generals Office at Washington and after the organization of the

to a port of embarkation until the details connected with the movement had been arranged directly with the commanding general of the port or with his subordinates23 The very serious congestion on the railroads in the autumn of I9I7 led to the taking over of the railroads by the government on December 28 as noted above On the same day the Storage and Traffic Division of the General Staff was created and placed under MajorGeneral George W Goethals January IO I9I8 in an effort to centralize and coordinate all army transportation General Goe thals appointed Mr H M Adams an experienced railroad man director of inland transportation24 and instructed him to organize a Division of Inland Transportation called after May I I9I8 the Inland Traffic Service which should have jurisdiction over all matters pertaining to the routing and transportation inland by whatever means of transport of all troops and property23 The new organization had to do primarily with the transportation of supplies and its activities in connection therewith cannot be dis cussed here In this article we are concerned only with its relation to the movement of troops and their unit equipment  Generally speaking it assumed the place formerly held by the Land Transpor tation Branch of the Quartermaster Generals Office The officer who had been in charge of that branch since December I I9I7 be came assistant to Mr Adams on January i8 i9I8 and exercised direct supervision over the handling of troops26 A Troop Move ment Section was established in the Division of Inland Transporta tion and after February 26 it was placed under an officer who had formerly been located in the office of the Quartermaster General as civilian representative of the American Railway Association The principal function of the Troop Movement Section was to act as a channel of communication between the Operations Division of the General Staff the Embarkation Service and the Troop Movement Section of the railroads After movements had been ordered by the Operations Division through the Adjutant General the department or camp quartermasters requested the Troop Movement Section of the Inland Traffic Service to supply routings dates of movements equipment etc this information it secured from the railroad or ganization and if it approved the routings proposed it informed the 23 Adjutant General to

Pullman and coach equipment and the scheduled dates for the movements The Troop Movement Section of the railroads issued the same instructions to the railroads interested and to their department general agents who informed the camp general agents27 The responsibility for carrying out instructions rested entirely upon the railroads and the local military authorities were not permitted to change a plan once decided upon nor to interfere with the operation of a train During I9I8 when an ever increasing number of troops was being shipped overseas a monthly conference was held at which the Operations Divisionthe Embarkation Service the Troop Move ment Section of the Inland Traffic Service and the Troop Movement Section of the railroads were all represented At this conference a tentative schedule for the next month was arranged The Opera tions Division stated what organization it desired to move overseas the Embarkation Service stated the probable amount of tonnage available and the railroad officials indicated the amount of equip ment they had on hand and to what extent they would be able to cooperate The date at which an organization was desired at the port of embarkation or at the embarkation camp was fixed by the commanding general of the port The Land Transportation Branch of the Quartermaster Generals Office continued to handle all trans portation matters not determined by the Inland Traffic Service but its work was taken over more and more by the latter and on June I5 i9i8 it was abolished28 The movement of troops with their impedimenta of selective service men and recruits may be divided into five phases first the movement of the Regular Army from the border to various camps second the movement of the National Guard to its training camps third the movement of the men of the National Army from their homes to the cantonments fourth intercamp movements to meet the needs of the service and lastly the movement of organizations from the camps to ports of embarkation29 This arrangement is not only a convenient one but it is in the large sense strictly chrono logical The active military forces of the United States at the outbreak

in China approximately 5o000 were on or near the Mexican border31 In May it was decided to concentrate the border troops at a comparatively small number of camps principally in the North and East where the various regiments might be utilized as nuclei for larger organizations recruits from depots be added and training for overseas service begun The first movements recorded by the Troop Movement Section of the railroads began on May i8 I917 when various regiments on the Mexican border began to en train for other points By June 4 this movement involving the transportation of approximately 25531 officers and men was com pleted Owing to the relatively small nuahber of men involved and their experience in travel the task of moving them was performed with great ease by the railroads The longest journey during this period was that of the I9I3 men of the 23d U S Infantry who travelled 2624 miles from El Paso Texas to Syracuse New York the shortest was that of the 1306 men of the I3th Cavalry from Fort Bliss Texas to Fort Riley Kansas a distance of 943 miles These organizations took with them all their baggage organization property and animals Where conditions warranted it the troop property and animals were loaded on a special train with only a few soldiers in other cases the trooptrain was composed not only of tourist sleepers for the men and baggage and boxcars for their impedimenta but also of flatcars for vehicles and stockcars for the animals It was at this time that the troops for the first convoy were con centrated at Hoboken for transportation to France Not one of the eight organizations comprising this first combatant force to cross the Atlantic travelled less than 2000 miles to the port of embarka tion One regiment of infantry travelled 2679 miles from Douglas Arizona the others came f rom various points in Texas The II234 men concerned travelled an average distance of 2392 miles to their destination The first units to leave the border were the supply companies of the four infantry regiments which entrained on May 3I the infantry regiments and the other units entrained June 23 and by June I0 the last train had arrived at Hoboken The Troop Movement Force of the railroads made all the arrange ments for this movement which has been characterized as the longest longdistance movement of troops that had ever been made 31 Report of the Adjutant General of the Army 19I7 table opposite p i9Troop Movements on American Railroads 475 at one time in the United States to that date32 It was a record often surpassed during the next seventeen months July 3 1917 the President issued a proclamation calling into the service of the United States the National Guard of thirty states The same proclamation provided that on August 5 the entire Na tional Guard of the nation should be drafted into the military service of the government83 At this time the National Guard consisted of sixteen tactical divisions Orders were issued for their concentra tion for organization and training at as many camps all of them located in the southern half of the country The movement of the state troops to camp involved the transportation by rail of about 343223 men and extended over a period of eleven weeks from August 4 to November 23 The entire movement was made by the railroads upon the schedule outlined by the War Department at the suggestion of the Troop Movement Force it was twice suspended for brief periods during the movement of increments of the Na tional Army to their cantonments34 The greater part of this move ment of the National Guard was completed before the middle of October I9I7 in November the New England regiments still in camp in the North were ordered to Camp Greene North Carolina In general when a unit of the National Guard moved from its home state to camp it carried with it all its organization property vehicles and animals Heavy tentage in most cases was shipped direct from depots to the training camps and not carried by the separate units Statistics are not at hand for the complete move ment of the Guard but up to October II 19I7 there had been transported to camp 294752 officers and men35 The average dis tance travelled was 770 miles in the South as a rule the National Guard went but a short distance to camp while the men from the Northern states often travelled great distancesthe Montana Na tional Guard for example journeyed 2645 miles to Camp Greene North Carolina In August I9I7 the War Department authorized the formation of a seventeenth National Guard division the Fortysecond from units selected from twentyseven states This division was concen trated at Camp Mills Long Island in the latter part of August I9I7 Those units possessing vehicles engineer signal corps and other heavy

National Army left their homes for the cantonments on September 5 I917 The process of mobili zation under the Selective Service Administration may be divided into three stages the requisition the call and the entrainment During I9I7 all requisitions and all calls were made for the run of the draft  ie for men either white or colored who were physically qualified for general military service Practically all of these men were sent to one or another of the sixteen National Army canton ments provided for the purpose But during I9I8 new conditions arose and men with certain physical occupational or educational qualifications were requisitioned Moreover the number of sta tions to which men could be sent was increased to include every post in the United States Alaska Hawaii and Porto Rico as well as hundreds of schools and colleges After the calls to be issued under a particular requisition had been allocated to the states which were to contribute to the levy induction telegrams were issued from Washington calling on the respective states for the entrainment of their quotas The railroads were then consulted the camp com manders notified and the proper supply bureaus informed Upon receipt of a call each state headquarters proceeded to allocate the call for that state among its local boards The time set for entrainment was generally made by the local boards an occasion of formality and ceremony and in most com munities it took on the marks of a public festivity There were public addresses parades and demonstrations at the railroad sta tions It was this public celebration on the day of entrainment which had much to do with popularizing the draft for  the general sentiment of military patriotism came thus to be associated in an open and emphatic manner with the processes of the draft 87 Prior to July 31 I9I8 drunkenness among drafted men en route to camp had occasionally led to disorders resulting in damage to railroad equipment and other property On that date certain changes were made in the Selective Service Regulations which pro vided for the wearing of a brassard in lieu of a uniform by all draftees thereby making it illegal to sell liquor to them for the 36 Report of the Acting Chief of the Militia Bureau I9I8 pp 8IO I39 37 Second Report of the Provost Marshal General to the Secretary of War Dec 20 I9I8 pp 232 ffTroop Movements on Amnerican Railroads 477 appointment of leaders for each contingent and for the distribu tion of regulations governing drafted men en route to camp These changes resulted in the practical elimination of all further trouble38 The 453I entraining points and in I9I8 the hundreds of sta tions to which the selectives were sent complicated the entrainment problem tremendously Before a call could be issued the Railroad Administration required fourteen days notice to enable it to com pile and print the train schedules for the movement which was usually distributed over a fiveday period and to make the neces sary arrangements with the railroads In I9I7 the entrainment schedules were all compiled and published by the several passenger associations of the country and a representative of the American Railway Association was placed in the office of the governor or adjutant general of each state to adjust any difficulties that might arise39 During I9I8 the United States Railroad Administration supervised the preparation of the schedules and replaced the  A R A man by a  military representative  of its Traffic Division These schedules which were most elaborate were prepared for each call in every state Each gave the number of the call the dates set for the movement the camp to which the men were to go the county countyseat and entraining station the number of men from each county the route to be followed the time of departure and the arrangements made for providing meals40 Copies of each schedule were placed in the possession of the railroads concerned and of every one of the local boards at points of origin As a result of this careful attention to detail the mobilization proceeded so smoothly that few persons in the community at large realized the enormous task which was being performed The Provost Marshal General in his reports on the operation of the Selective Service System41 expresses the utmost admiration of the work of the railroads throughout the war No more difficult transportation problem  he says  could be conceived  their work  was so satisfactorily performed that less than a dozen complaints were received during the whole year of I9I8 At times they were called upon to handle as many as 50000 selected men in one day and to transport within a single month over 400000 men for the selective service system alone Their performance on

route and were restoring the men to the original points of entrainment This achievement  continues the Provost Marshal General  stands out as a marvel of efficiency and is but an indication of the cooperation which they constantly ren dered The total number of men called under the selective service sys tem was 280I358 According to the records of the Provost Mar shal Generals Office 2755476 of these men were transported to camp by railroads controlled by the United States Railroad Admin istration42 The average number of miles travelled by each man was 388 the entire mobilization therefore involved the equivalent of I069I24688 miles of travel by one passenger It is estimated that the movements required for the mobilization under the selective draft represented about onefourth of the entire troop movement for the War Department By the middle of October 19I7 the greater part of the National Guard troops had reached their training camps in the South and nearly 450000 selected men of the first draft had been transported to the sixteen National Army cantonments The movements of the Regular Army already described involved about 36765 men Be ginning about the first of August 19I7 large intercamp movements of the Regular Army began in the course of which organizations were ordered from their stations to more convenient camps and con centration points and recruits were transported from various depots throughout the country to the camps One small group of recruits for example was ordered f rom Vancouver Barracks to Waco Texas a distance of 4078 miles In September and October train ing cadres of 96I men each were ordered transferred from the Regu lar Army to each of the sixteen National Army divisions43 During the autumn of I917 some 50ooo men of the Regular Army were transferred from their stations in the North to more comfortable winter quarters in southern camps As time went on the inter camp movements of the regulars increased in frequency and by 42 Second

general policy of the Operations Commit tee always to move troops from the West towards the ports of em barkation but it was not always possible or practicable to do so About the middle of October I9I7 the Operations Committee began to transfer from each National Army cantonment sufficient drafted men to bring the corresponding National Guard division to full strength In this connection an interesting situation developed in the South In September it began to appear that if the three southern National Guard divisionsthe 30th 3Ist and 39thwere to be brought to full strength by men drawn from Camps Jackson Gordon and Pike the corresponding National Army cantonments these latter camps would each be left with more colored than white troops which was deemed highly undesirable To concentrate all the white men from these three cantonments at one would leave the other two with no white men and all their negroes The problem was finally solved by distributingtheentirecolored draft throughout the country in such a way that the ratio of whites to colored was everywhere preponderant by filling up all the National Guard divi sions with National Army men from the corresponding canton ments by concentrating at Camp Jackson all the remaining white men in Camps Jackson Gordon and Pike and forming of them an AllSouthern  National Army division the 8ist and by form ing at Camps Gordon and Pike two composite National Army divi sions the 82d and 87th of men drawn from all the remaining National Army cantonments except Camp Lewis To accomplish all this necessitated the transportation of between i050o0 and I Ioooo more men than had been anticipated by the Operations Committee Beginning about December I5 many National Army troops were transferred to camps where Regular Army organiza tions were being recruited to full strength In the last ten weeks of I9I7 approximately I75000 drafted men were moved from one camp to another45 During 19I8 as the army continued to grow in size these inter camp movements increased in volume The practice of drawing on the drafted men to fill the National Guard and Regular Army divisions continued In March the Operations Division began to draw on the depot brigades of the National Army for men for vari ous special and technical servicesfor corps and army troops for 44 Memorandum of Capt T W Hammond General Staff for

Waco Texas for various flying fields and during the summer and autumn of i9i8 there was a steady stream of men to and from the National Army training detachments at various educa tional institutions throughout the country4 These intercamp move ments involved about 42 per cent of the total number of men trans ported by rail between January i and November ii I9I8 No accurate statistics are available regarding the number of men who travelled on furlough during the war but that extremely heavy demands were made upon the railroads by the furloughs granted at divisional camps for weekends and holidays is obvious At Thanksgiving and at Christmas 19I7 the number of men on leave was well above ioooCo in each case As for the number of men regularly on leave the general agent at Camp Meade for example estimated that about II500 men about 30 per cent of the total strength of the camp were granted passes or furloughs durinig the week of February I04 At Camp Sherman 30 per cent of the 32900 men in the camp were granted leaves of absence for Christ mas I9I7 and it was the custom at that camp to grant weekend passes to 25 per cent of the men in each unit48 The movement of troops to the ports of embarkation for trans portation overseas was necessarily conditioned by the War Depart ments plans regarding the composition and strength of the expe ditionary forces and a brief discussion of these plans is requisite for a complete understanding of the problem At the outbreak of the war and for some time thereafter the War Department had no definite plan of operation49 At the request of both the British and French governments however it was decided to despatch as soon as possible base hospitals ambulance units railway engineers and other auxiliary troops who could be

the urgent insistence of the French a small division of com batant troops was sent abroad and by January I I9I8 two com plete divisions and parts of three others were in France July IO I9I7 General Pershing transmitted to Washington his  general organization project  for the A E F which called for a force of twenty combat divisions and ten replacement divisions organized in five corps of six divisions each with the proper proportions of corps army and serviceoftherear troops50 This force about I328448 men was to be in France in time for an offensive in 1 91I8 51 September I I I917 the War College Division in a memorandum for the Chief of Staff discussed the problem of raising sufficient men by September I I9I8 to meet General Pershings request In stead of five corps they planned to create seven corps of six divi sions each with the necessary corps and army troops The last corps would have but four divisions Apparently their idea was that it would be possible to transport overseas four corps by April I I9I8 the fifth corps by June i the sixth by July i and the seventh by August i Such an army would have numbered i675 ooo men On October 7 I9I7 General Pershing sent to the War Department a Priority of Shipments Schedules in which was shown the order in which he desired the troops for the expeditionary forces despatched to France The schedule did not apply to the special and technical troops furnished the French and British nor did it cover the replacement drafts aviation troops and headquar ters personnel Its purpose was to provide a proper balance be tween all the various elements of the expeditionary forces The existing situation he said was difficult because the serviceofthe rear troops in France did not bear an adequate proportion to the combat troops already there or expected in the near future The schedule outlined a plan of shipment by phases  of which there were six in all Each phase except the last consisted of one corps of combat troops and the proper proportion of serviceoftherear corps and army troops He desired 50 per cent of the serviceof therear troops to precede the combat troops in each phase and the remaining 50 per cent to be shipped with the first half of the com 50 A E F proj ect of Sept I 8 I 9 I 7 51 In his memorandum of July Io I9I7 Pershing places his total forces desired at IIooooo Sept I8 I9I7 he

desire to have the first four phasesabout I020000 menin France in time for the I9I8 offen sive This date was usually set at June i I9I8 Throughout the winter of I9I7I9I8 an effort was made by the Operations Division to have the shipment of troops conform as closely as possible to the Priority of Shipments Schedule but various things conspired to make this difficult In March I9I8 Pershing cabled that altogether too many combat troops were reach ing France in proportion to serviceoftherear service of sup ply S 0 S corps and army troops52 But the chief diffi culty was the shortage of ocean tonnage especially cargo tonnage for obviously it was inadvisable to ship troops to France unless we were prepared to maintain them there The limited production of certain necessary supplies and the limited facilities for embarkation and especially debarkation still further complicated matters In February I9I8 the situation looked so black that the Director of Operations believed it would be virtually impossible to transport the first three phases8I900o mento France by August i I9I8 it might be practicable he thought to send over about 300000 men in addition to the 2750oo men of the first phase which he anticipated would be in France by March i But as a basis for requirements and estimates on the part of the supply bureaus he suggested a tentative strength table calling for the presence in France of 837000 men by June I I05I000 by August i and I372ooo by December i In other words the hope of fulfilling General Persh ings plan for an army of five corps in France in time for an offen sive in I9I8 was postponed until I919 On February 25 I9I8 the plans and recommendations of the Director of Operations were approved by the Secretary of War53 This is really the first  offi cial plan for the raising and transportation of the army The success of the German offensive which began March 2I was so great that the War Department was led to attempt what five weeks earlier had been considered impossible Ships were pro cured men and supplies were provided and the greatest troop move ment in history began The complete story of that achievement cannot be told here for its success was dependent rather upon ship 52 Memorandum of Gen Henry Jervey director of operations to the Adju tant General Mar 27 I9I8 53 Memorandum of Gen Henry Jervey to the Chief of Staff Feb i8 I9I8Troop Movemients on American Railroads 483 ping than upon the railroads But it must not be forgotten that every man shipped abroad had to be transported by rail to the port of embarkation before he could go aboard ship and that frequently detachments travelled farther by rail to reach the port of embarka tion than they did by army transport to reach the port of debarka tion in France or England Between the first of May I9I7 and the eleventh of November I9I8 the Troop Movement Section of the railroads supervised the transportation to the various ports of embarkation of 2I74455 men Of these I758033 or 8i per cent of the total were transported to Hoboken and the embarkation camps serving that port 250404 men or about i2 per cent to New port News and the rest to other ports54 Of the total number car ried to the ports of embarkation during the nineteen months of the war 76 per cent I653470 men were embarked for overseas in the seven months from April to November i9i8 The shipment of troops continued to follow the  Priority of Shipments Schedule of October 19I7 but with the emphasis upon combat troops and at no time during the war did the number of auxiliary troops or  S 0 S troops attain the proportions desired by General Pershing So far as divisions were concerned the first three phases had been completed by the middle of June by August 12 the combat troops at least of five phases were overseas and the Operations Division was planning to send the sixth and seventh phases of combat troops By November i i these seven phases had been completed July i8 I9I8 it was decided to increase the American Expeditionary Forces abroad to at least eighty divisions about 3360ooo men by June 30 I919 and the succeeding drafts were all calculated upon that basis55 But the signing of the armistice November ii halted the fulfillment of these ambitious plans At that time there were approximately 3757624 men in the United States Army of these some 2o860oo had been transported overseas and I67I000 re mained in the United States56 The limitations of space forbid any detailed discussion of the movement of troops to the ports of embarkation It must suffice to describe the method by which troops were despatched from camp to seaboard In the first place the Operations Division of the Gen eral Staff drew up from time to time priority lists  designating cer tain units for service overseas and giving the contemplated dates of 54 Annual Report of the Director General of Railroads I9I8  Operations  P 47 55Report of the Chief of Staff U S A to the Sec of War

officials the Inland Traffic Service the Troop Movement Section of the rail roads and the Operations Division General Staff usually covered shipments from camps to ports for a period of one month in ad vance They directed the various departments to prepare the troops thus designated for overseas service and when they were ready to notify the Director of Embarkation at Washington A copy of the list subject to change was forwarded to the port of embarkation where it was turned over to the  dispatch office  That office then sent to each organization listed a letter of instructions and the em barkation and debarkation regulations When a reply was received stating that the organization was fully equipped or equipped except for certain shortages that could not be supplied the Director of Embarkation was notified He in turn informed the Adjutant Gen eral who telegraphed the department or camp commander to f or ward the troops when their presence was desired at the port As soon as space was available at the embarkation camps or on trans ports and provided the organization stood in the proper place on the priority schedule it was ordered to port on the authority of the commanding general of the port of embarkation The general agent of the Railroad Administration notified the Troop Movement Sec tion at Washington of the movement and the latter then arranged the routing and train schedule to conform as closely as possible to the desires of the dispatch office  The movements of the troops to the ports were so timed as to fit in with all other rail movements throughout the United States so as to avoid congestion and an ex cessive demand for equipment during a limited period57 The various authorities of the port who were interested in the movement were also informed and were thus enabled to make the necessary preparations for the reception of the organization upon its arrival The general agent and the local quartermaster at the starting point were responsible for the assembling of equipment and the arranging of all the details of departure58 Such was the process followed in the case of troops not in divi sions With divisions the procedure was somewhat different When a division on the priority list was reported nearly ready to entrain for the port the dispatch office telegraphed for the division liaison officer and at the same time ordered into the embarkation camp the 57 Rept of the Chief of Staff U S A to the Sec of War 19I9 p 40 58 Report of Maj S J Chamberlin dispatch officer to the commanding gen eral at the port of embarkation Hoboken N J

troop movement began in April I9I8 an attempt was made to have the various elements of a division entrain in the order General Pershing desired them to arrive in France60 The first units to depart for the seaboard were generally the engineer regiment and field train field signal battalion and sanitary squad rons then came the division headquarters followed at a little inter val by the headquarters train and military police the remaining divisional trains half the medical complement of field hospitals and ambulance companies the bakery and butchery company and base hospital These were followed by the two infantry brigades the machinegun battalion and artillery brigade in the order named and the remaining auxiliary units brought up the rear The 32d Divi sion for example observed this arrangement quite closely in its movement from Camp MacArthur Waco Texas to Camp Merritt New Jersey The movement began January IO I9I8 and was not completed until February I3 To transport the 24874 men in the division required fiftyeight trains each averaging fifteen cars and carrying 428 men The distance travelled averaged I969 miles per train and was covered in five days and eight hours at an average rate of I53 miles per hour6 As general agents camp quartermasters entraining officers and railroad officials became more experienced in the handling of troop trains they constantly bettered their previous records One or two examples of what they accomplished will not be out of place here On June I9 I9I8 the gIst Division began its movement from Camp Lewis Washington to Camp Merritt Between that date and June 30 sixtyfour trains were despatched eastward carrying the 27085 men of the division The last train arrived at its desti nation at 9 oo PM July 6 These sixtyfour trains were sent over thirteen different routes the average distance travelled by each train being 3205 miles Running at about twenty miles per hour each train required an average time of six and a half days to make the journey across the continent The average number of cars per train was thirteen of men 42362 Perhaps the best performance of the war in the field of transportation was the movement of the

destination at an average rate of speed of 202 miles per hour The average time per train was seven days and three hours The efficient cooperation of all concerned in the movement made possible the despatch of all the trains on the minute scheduled with the exception of two which were respec tively four and five minutes late As a result of a competition in loading inaugurated among the train commanders few trains after the second day required more than five minutes from the time of arrival of the troops in the entraining area to the last man entrained Fifteen trains were loaded in less than three and a half minutes each63 The utmost secrecy was maintained in the despatch of troop trains to ports of embarkation and all telegraphic reports regarding their movements were transmitted in cipher While railroad offi cials had been authorized as early as September I3 I9I7 to notify accredited Red Cross representatives at points where trooptrains were scheduled to stop on December i i they were instructed not to impart this information in the case of trains moving toward a sea port64 This restriction remained in force until October I2 I9I8 when it was removed by order of the Director of Operations65 As regards equipment it was at first the policy of the War De partment to send troops to the ports of embarkation completely equipped with both personal equipment and organization property This was not always practicable however the artillery units almost without exception took no guns with them and horses or mules when taken were usually sent to Newport News for shipment to France In November I9I7 General Pershing was insistent that all divisions and other units sent to France should be completely equipped with the authorized transportation at least before leaving the United States66 The instructions to the ports of embarkation directed that all equipment so far as practicable be shipped on the same vessel with the organization to which it pertained67 but the 63 Report of Capt C D Gorton entraining officer 8th Div to commanding general 8th Div Oct 26 I9I8 64 Bulletins nos 30 30A Sept I3 Dec iI 1917 of ex com of Special Committee on Natl Defense Am

I9I8Troop Movements on American Railroads 487 heavy troop movements in the summer of i9i8 made this procedure difficult if not impossible July 5 i9I8 Pershing cabled that confu sion existed due to the fact that organizations were still arriving without their equipment He recommended that the organizations should be embarked with their equipment on the same transport if that were impossible organizations should be stripped of their or ganization property in the United States the property turned into depots and subsequently shipped in bulk without reference to any particular organization it would thus become available for general issue68 The second alternative was adopted August I0 I9I8 thoops were ordered to take with them overseas only individual equipment and clothing field ranges and organization records69 Until July II I9I8 each enlisted man was entitled to carry with him a barrack bag with extra equipment the weight being limited to seventyfive pounds after that date his clothing and equipment were reduced to that carried on the person Officers baggage also was reduced company officers being allowed to take only I50 pounds instead of the 250 pounds previously authorized 0 From May I9I7 when the Troop Movement Section began its work until November II i9I8 the railroads of the country trans ported 8714582 men an average of 502764 per month The maxi mum was reached in July I9I8 when no less than I47013 men were moved Retween September 5 I9I7 and the armistice 2287t 926 drafted men were entrained at 4531 separate points in larger or smaller units and moved on schedule to their stations in many cases upward of a days journey and in all cases were fed in transit71 It would be difficult to overestimate the amount of detail involved in routing scheduling moving and feeding these men It required II959 special trooptrains each averaging 8754 miles to transport 5o46092 men in addition to the drafted men referred to above and the I380564 men carried on regular trains This is undoubtedly the greatest longdistance troop movement by land in history The railroads carried 2I74455 men into the crowded port terminals for embarkation overseas without interfering with the heavy traffic already being handled through those ports and in the 68 Pershing cable no 14I9 July 5 I9I8 69 Circular War Dept Aug io i9i8 70 Id July i i I9I8 71 The figures given here are those of the Troop Movement Section Second Rept of the Provost Marshal General i9i8 p 24I says that 2755476 drafted men were transported to camp by rail It is quite possible that many men trans ported in regular trains were not reported to the Troop Movement Section which concerned itself primarily with the movement of special trains488 R H McLean adjacent territory During one period of thirty days more than twenty trooptrains each day were brought into the port of New York During the entire period of the war there were but sixteen train accidents involving death or injury but thirtynine men were killed and 335 injured Of the total number of men moved during the war about 262 per cent were draftpd men on their way to camp 249 per cent were troops moving toward the ports and the remain ing 489 per cent represents the mobilization of the Regular Army and National Guard and the intercamp movements To accomplish so vast an achievement required the use of ap proximately 704I3 sleepingcars I35756 coaches I6285 baggage and expresscars and 23075 freightcars The average number of men carried in each special trooptrain was 42I the number of cars per train was 126 and an average rate of I98 miles per hour was maintained Besides the II959 special trooptrains mentioned above it is estimated that 4576 special trains were required for drafted men It was not found necessary as in Europe to utilize freightcars for the transportation of troops and in fact it was cus tomary to furnish sleepingcars in all journeys which extended over twentyfour hours It was not always possible to do this of course but 267I074 men about 306 per cent of all troops moved were handled in Pullman cars2 The work of the railroads of the United States in transporting the soldiers of the American army to the camps from camp to camp and finally to the ports of embarkation for service overseas was not spectacular nor did it receive as much attention as it deserved from the people of the country for much of it was necessarily veiled in secrecy and the newspapers said very little about it But it was splendidly done nevertheless and it was by no means the least factor in the ultimate success of the United States in the war That the War Department so regarded it is shown by the fact that in March I919 it conferred the Distinguished Service Medal upon Mr George Hodges manager of the Troop Movement Section for meritorious services in connection with the movement of troops in the United States Ross H McLEAN 72 Annual Report of the Director General of Railroads

adverse ly a portion of the sidewalk on the corner of two public streets such occupancy having been continuous since March 27 I89o and now asks an injunction restraining the municipal authorities from forcibly removing him and his fruit stand from the premises held that the decree of the lower court dismissing the bill of complaint on demurrer should be affirmed Pastorino v City of Detroit et al Mich 1914 148 N W 23I There is an irreconcilable conflict in American cases as to whether the right of the public to use land dedicated for a street or highway may be extinguished by nonuser or adverse possession due to laches negligence or nonaction of municipal authorities The weight of the adjudged cases seems to be that the Statute of Limitations will not run against the municipality States holding to the contrary were Arkansas Connecticut Kentucky Minne sota Missouri Nebraska Vermont Texas Oregon and Michigan Prior to the passage of Act No 46 PUBLIC ACTS OF MICHIGAN I907 title by adverse possession could be established in lands owned by the municipal corporation the same as though owned by private individuals Flynn v Detroit 93 Mich 590 Leanard v Detroit 108 Mich 599 Schneider v Detroit 135 Mich 570 Vier v Detroit iii Mich 646 Big Rapids v Comstock 65 Mich 78 By that act however it was provided that Hereafter no rights as against the public shall be acquired by any person by reason of the occupa tion or use of any public street etc States enacting similar laws more or less recent are Missouri I865 Minnesota I899 Nebraska I899 Oregon I895 Texas I887 The statement in LaBarre v Bent 154 Mich 520 II8 N W 6 that it is clearly the law that under some circumstances a private person may acquire title to a highway by adverse possession would appear to be dicta and opposed to the terms of the statute BANKRUPTCYPREFERENCE THROUGH LEGAL PROCEEDINGSFINAL DIS POSITIONA petition filed against one of the respondents charged that within four months next preceding its filing said respondent committed an act of bankruptcy in that while insolvent she allowed a judgment to be recovered against her and an execution issued thereon and levied thereby giving a preference to such judgment creditor and further that at the time of filing the petition which was one day less than four months after the levy of execution she had not vacated or discharged the levy and resulting preferenceHeld that such failure to vacate or discharge the levy is not a final disposition of the property affected by the levy within the meaning of  3a 3 of the Bankruptcy Act of I898 providing against preferences by legal proceedings and further that there is nothing in the above named clause which suggests that the time when the lien is obtained has any bearing upon when the property must be freed from it to avoid an act ofMICHIGAN LAW REVIEW bankruptcy Citizens Banking Co v Ravenna Nat Bank et al 1914 34 Sup Ct 8o6 The contention of counsel that the act of bankruptcy was committed by failure of respondent to extinguish the lien five days before the expiration of the four months was undoubtedly predicated upon the decisions In Re Tupper I63 Fed 766 Folger v Putnam 194 Fed 793 but the Supreme Court repudiates such doctrine unmistakably and in so doing accords with Seaboard Steel Casting Co v Trigg 124 Fed 75 In Re Vastbinder 126 Fed 417 In Re Vetterman I35 Fed 443 In Re Truitt 203 Fed 550 The question is a hard one on the one hand the Supreme Courts decision makes it possible for an insolvent debtor to prefer one of his creditors by allowing the entry of a judgment and letting it sleep for four monthsthe judgment lien then becomes immune from attack by the other creditors on the other hand the contention that four months inaction amounts to a final disposi tion of the property subject to the judgment lien is farfetched and as pointed out in the principal case has no basis in the statute however salutary its effect may be In the words of the opinion a final disposi tion used in connection with the statute unquestionably means an affirma tive act of disposal not a mere lapse of time which leaves the lien intact and still requiring enforcement Succinctly put it is an act having sub stantially the effect of a salethe transfer of ownership and control from one to another BANKRUPTCYSTOCKBROKERSRATABLE DISTRIBUTION oS STocKBank rupts who were stockbrokers having incurred liability to their customers for 280 shares of stock failed with but IOO shares of such stock in their possession Held that each customer was entitled as against the general creditors to such proportion of the stock in the possession of the brokers at the time of the bankruptcy as the shares which the brokers should have held to his account bore to the total amount of shares which should have been in their possession In Re H B Hollins  Co I914 212 Fed 317 The decision in the principal case is in accord with the previously an nounced doctrine that where a stockbroker has in his possession at the time of his bankruptcy certificates of stock placed in his hands by a cus tomer but not yet sold or stock bought for a customer but not yet delivered to him he holds the same as an agent or bailee and the stock may be reclaimed from his trustee in bankruptcy In re James Corothers  Co 182 Fed 50i And it is immaterial that the certificates found in bankrupts possession are not identical with those bailed or appropriated to the cus tomer as his property by the purchasing broker since certificates of stock are but indicia of the property in the shares and not the stock itself and as one share of stock is not different in kind or quantity from every other share of the same issue and company the owners of such in the bankrupts posses sionas in

j100000,Science,1763662,Among the Publishers,i300594,SCIENCE results are of great interest He finds that the Bermudian fauna is essentially a winddrift and currentdrift fauna whose elements have been received in principal part from the United States and the West Indies Some portion of the fauna appears to have been derived from the west coast of Europe and Africa or from the Azores The fauna appears to be of considerable antiquity a conclusion which is supported by the fact that the predecessor of a group of Pulmonata now peculiar to the islands is found fossil or subfossil in the rocks of these islands Certain marked ele ments of the Bermudian fauna are of a distinctively Pacific type but it seems impossible at the present time to explain this mixed relationship The book is illustrated with good views from the Bermudas and a number of plates illustrating the concluding chapters on zoology AMONG THE PUBLISHERS THE second part of the  Contributions to the MicroPalaeon tology of the CambroSilurian Rocks of Canada published by the Canadian Geological and Natural History Survey is by Mr E 0 Ulrich of the Geological Survey of Illinois It consists of a de scriptivereport on some fossil Polyzoa Bryozoa and Ostracoda from Manitoba and is illustrated by two fullpage lithographic plates To facilitate the binding of the present part with Mr Foords previously published report the pagination and numbering of the plates of both have been made consecutive A new guidebook to Florida by Charles Ledyard Norton will be published by Longmans Green  Co early in December The scheme of the volume is similar to that of the wellknown Baedecker guides adapted to requirements of travellers in such a country as Florida Separate maps of the counties with postroads and the new railway systems are a noteworthy feature of the book This guidebook is a revival on a new and more comprehensive plan of  The Florida Annual  originally published and most favorably received by the public in I885 The Handbook of Precious Stones by M D Rothschild just published by G P Putnams Sons of this city is intended for the merchant workman and amateur Mr Rothschild is a well known diamonddealer of this city and he was led to write this book by finding how many of those having to do with diamonds rubies sapphires and emeralds know nothing of these precious stones The information is given in concise form we fear even too conciseLy but we trust that Mr Rothschilds ambition may be gratified and that a second and larger edition may appear in due time Mr Edwin Lassetter Bynner opens the December number of the Atlantic Monthly with an article of interest to the antiquarian and especially to the student of Old Boston This paper is devoted to  The Old Bunch of Grapes  Tavern one of the most famous New England hostelries of the last century and Mr Bynner gives an amusing account of the various events which took place within its hospitable walls Mr Henry Van Brunts paper on  Archi tecture in the West tells about the difficulties which Western architects have to struggle against and the new school of archi tecture which is gradually arising to solve the problem of making art keep step with progress without losing the finer and more deli cate artistic sense It will be studied by all Western men and all architects with a great deal of interest Professor N S Shaler of Harvard College contributes a paper on  School Vacations  and Mr William Cranston Lawton whose articles on the Greek drama have been among the best literary papers the Atlantic has lately had writes about  Delphi The Locality and its Legends  and 6Latin and Saxon America the relations of this country with South American countries forms the subject of a paper by Mr Al bert G Browne INDUSTRIAL NOTES Improved Belt Power AirPump and Condenser THE airpump and condenser here illustrated has been newly designed by the builders Conover Co 21I9 Market Street New ark NJ in answer to the demands of powerusers who are seek ing the greatest attainable economy in all details of the modern steamplant With the introduction of highspeed compound engines there is felt the need of a thoroughly efficient and simple condensing appa 377 ratus The power required to drive it must be reduced to a mini mum and this same power must be of the most economical sort otherwise the advantages gained by condensing will be seriously affected if not wholly counteracted In fact it is a matter of rec ord where tests have proven that certain engines have shown bet ter economy running noncondensing than when condensing owing to the very wasteful manner in which the power was applied to the condensing apparatus In presenting this airpump and condenser to the public the builders believe that they are offering a highly efficient simple and durable arrangement As will be seen by the engraving the air pump is run by belt which can be direct from the engineshaft or from a countershaft whichever may be the more convenient Being driven by the main engine it is obvious that the power used to operate the airpump must of necessity be of the same economy as the engine Thus if the engine in question be com pound condensing running on two pounds of coal per horsepower or less it necessarily follows that the airpump will be operated by a similar economy An examination of the engraving will make the operation of the condenser and airpump quite plain The POWER AIRPUMP AND CONDENSER spray distributes the injection water in such a manner that every particle of steam mut come in contact with the water and thus effect condensation with a minimum amount of water and at the same time heat the overflow to the maximum temperature The opening from the condenser to the airpump is shaped to allow the greatest quantity of water to flow through a given opening The pump is made amply large to remove the greatest quantity of water needed for condensing to the full capacity of the condenser The reciprocating parts are countdrbalanced by means of a weight in the wheel to insure smooth running As will be seen the air pump is vertical and singleacting and this the builders believe to be the best form to avoid airlocks In fact the design throughout looks to the avoidance of all corners or pockets where air can collect and remain This condenser is specially adapted to the re quirements of highspeed compound engines in electric light and power plants because it can be run at a speed independent of that of the engine or it may be attached to more than one engine It is also adapted to be applied to existing plants as a saver of fuel or an increaser of power on the same fuel The machine is made throughout of the best of the several materials All wear ing parts and valveseats that come in contact with injection water are made of best composition and the workmanship is of the best When the airpump is in operation the valves and stuffingbox are constantly covered with water effectually sealing them All parts are easily accessible without dismounting wheel or shaft NOVEMBER 29 1889

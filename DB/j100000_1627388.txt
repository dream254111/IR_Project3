OF AN AFRICAN FAUNA SEVERAL years ago the discovery of some new types of Rhinoceroses in this country directed my attention afresh to the study of the Tertiary fauna of Europe as parallel with that of America In the succession of European and American types it ap peared that there were most interesting similarities between rhinoceroses as widely separated as the present regions of Colo rado and Southern France but upon at tempting more than a general comparison I was confronted by a lack of definite time scale between the levels in which these ani mals occur The available correlations by Cope Filhol Scott Zittel and others proved too indefinite at certain points This diffi culty became so obstructive that a more ex act correlation of European and American horizons appeared to be an essential basis not only for the phylogeny of the Rhinoc eroses but for that of other types of mam mals of Europe and North America STRATIGRAPHICAL CORRELATION In an address before the Academy last year the various steps which have been taken to secure such correlation were de scribed The work proves to be a very diffi Address of retiring President New York Acad emy of Sciences February 26 1900SCIEWNE cult one and is by no means complete The kind cooperation of the leading pale ontologists of Europe was enlisted and as a result an approximate correlation sheet was prepared This was virtually a report of progress in this investigation main em phasis being laid upon geological succession In continuing the subject this year main emphasis will be laid upon faunal succession or the distribution of the different orders and families of mammals concluding with the latest views as to the succession of life during the Pleistocene period in Europe LYELLS SYSTEM lmerWCanParoex i UPPER

geological succession and correlation so far as it has been carried at present and illustrates the rapid progress of our knowl edge of our own horizons It includes the latest results of the American Museum ex plorations in the Miocene of Colorado and Kansas as roughly studied by Matthew but these correlations are not to be under stood as final Scott has already trans ferred our John Day of Oregon from the Miocene where it was formerly placed to the Upper Oligocene The lower part at least of these beds belongs in the Oligocene while the Upper John Day may prove to correspond with the Lower Miocene of Europe Our Pliocene record as compared with the magnificent Pliocene of Europe is extremely meagre and our Miocene succes sion rich as it is is not as fully understood as the Miocene of France We look for more exact results from the American Museum explorations which are now being collated It is only when we pass into the great time period from the Oligocene down wards that the American record becomes a superbly complete time standard for the whole Northern Hemisphere or Holarctic Region TERTIARY GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTIqN The importance of geographical distri bution was first recognized by Humboldt and set forth by Darwin in the  Origin of Species in 1858 In the same year Sclater divided the world into eastern and west ern divisions or Palaeogmea and Neogma to embrace the Old and New Worlds re spectively a division which has proved to be totally illogical This led Darwins dis tinguished colleague Alfred Wallace to his great work upon the Geographical Distri bution of Animals  and the division of the world into life regions in which Sclaters scheme was adopted and developed In 1868 Huxley divided the world into a north ern division Arctogmea and a southern division Notogaea to include the Northern and Southern Hemispheres respectively this division was a little nearer the truth than Sclaters Between 1868 and 1890  The history of opinion upon this subject is fully set forth by Lydekkers invaluable work the Geo graphical Distribution of Mammals published in 1896 562 N S VOL XI No 276SCIENCE Sclater Allen Newton and Blanford working upon living birds and mammals continued this investigation but it re mained for Blanford in 1890 to prove that the world zoologically should be divided into three great divisions an Australian a South American and a third region Arc togaea comprising North America Europe Asia and Africa Now it is clear that exactly as our under standing of the relations of living animals and plants to each other depends upon their fossil ancestors or upon their paleon tology so the final test of a scheme of zoological distribution must be a paleon tological test The animals of various families and orders have either originated in or migrated into their present habi tat in past time so that the geological record as to their order of appearance be comes of first importance Here again the necessity of an absolutely reliable correlation time scale such as we are now establishing becomes evident for the very first step toward an exact solution of the problem of past migration is to establish as far as pos sible the faunal parallels upon different continents we can then determine where certain types of animals first appeared and distinguish between the autocthonous en demic or native types and the migrant or new types This then is our problem to connect living distribution with distribution in past time and to propose a system which will be in harmony with both sets of facts The tests of synchronism between Euro pean and American depositions are four fold First the presence of a number of identical or closely allied genera and species Second similarity in the steps of evolution in related animals Third the predomi nance and spread of certain animals as of the oddtoed Ungulates in the middle Eocene and of the eventoed Ungulates in the Upper Eocene Fourth the sudden appearance of new types which have ap parently originated elsewhere and have en joyed an extensive migration so that they appear simultaneously in different regions of the earth An instance of this kind is afforded by the unheralded appearance of new types in the base of the Oligocene Rhinoceroses and of the Miocene Pro boscidia in Europe and America Unfortunately there is still no agreement among zoologists as to the faunal geograph ical divisions Lydekker well versed in both paleontology and zoology has for the first time brought together both classes of evidence in his recent valuable work upon the Geographical Distribution of Mam mals he shows conclusively that zoo paleontology favors the division of the world into three great realms as proposed by Blanford to these may be applied the terms Arctogsea Notogsea and Neogea as proposed anonymously in 1893 Chart II Geographically these realms are con nected by low lying portions of the earth which during long periods of submergence beneath the sea have completely isolated them At the same time we are forced to conclude that there were shorter intervals of elevation or land continuity at various times during the Tertiary period Now it is a wellknown principle of zoo logical evolution that an isolated region if large and sufficiently varied in itstopog raphy soil climate and vegetation will give rise to a diversified fauna according to the law of adaptive radiation  from primi tive and central types Branches will spring off in all directions to take advantage of every possible opportunity of securing food The modifications which animals undergo in this adaptive radiation are largely of mechanical nature they are lim So termed by the writer see Rise of Mammalia in North America 1893 and Origin of Mammals 1898 563 APRIL 13

276 above orders and the Hystricomorph rodents enjoyed their chief radiation In Notogcea two orders were cut off by the sea one of them a rapidly declining type the Mono tremes the other the Marsupials enjoying a very highly diversified radiation This hypothesis is expressed in Chart IV Two other orders of mammals the Sirenia prob ably a branch of the hoofed tribe took the CHART IIDivision of the World into three Realms and nine main Geographical Regions nental platform is raised to the 200 metre line showing the main Tertiary land connections scale but the similarity is never complete and exact When migrations are favored by overpopulation or geographical changes a new and severe test of fitness arises by the mingling and competition of the parallel types Now under the operation of these laws a most interesting generalization or hypothe sis can be made as to the three realms geographical isolation has been so continu ous and prolonged that great orders of mammals have been evolved Chart IV in each Thus Aretogcea containing the broad est and most highly diversified land area appears hypothetically as the center in which fourteen primitive and specialized orders radiated from each other In the southern portion of Neogcea at least four orders sprang from primitive members of the rivers and coasts of America Europe and probably Africa as their radiating center while the Cetacea occupied the fourth or oceanic realm Now we mean to express by this hy pothesis that Realms were the main centers of adaptive radiation of orders by no means the exclusive areas of distribution for dur ing the periods of land contact certain members of these orders found their way into adjacent realms Each realm there fore contains its pure autocthonous types and its migrant or derived types Regions on the other hand may be distinguished from realms as geographical and zoological areas which have been isolated from each other for shorter periods either by climatic barriers as in the case of the Arctic or cir cumpolar region or by great physical bar 0 E URASIATICi JNORTHfTEMPERATE NORTHIAMERIC V s PalaearcticL oJl tc  NearItI c CZ5INDOMALAYAN

Africa appear to have been so large dis tinct and isolated as to have become im portant centers of the radiation of certain orders of mammals and almost attain the rank of realms but regions in general are chiefly and permanently distinguished by the adaptive radiation of families of mammals Arctogeea may thus be still divided on the old lines into five or six regions the Arctic or Circumpolar the Ethiopian or African south of the Sahara the Indo Malayan or Oriental including southern Asia and the Malayan islands the Ma lagasy including Madagascar the Nearctic and the Palaearctic There is no question as suggested by Professor Newton in his term  Holarctic and by Professor Allen in 1892 in his term North temperate that the North American Nearctic and Eur asiatic Palaearctic regions are now so closely similar that they might be united into one When however the zoological or existing characteristics of these regions are put to a paleontological test it is found necessary to separate them because throughout the Tertiary period North America and Eurasia were so remote that to a certain extent they constituted cen ters not only of independent family but to a limited degree of ordinal radiation At the same time they were unified both by frequent intermigrations and by a simul taneous evolution of allied animals We now come to one of the greatest tri umphs of recent biological investigation namely the concurrence of botanical zoo logical and paleontological testimony in the reconstruction of a great southern conti nent to which the name Antarctica has been given Following Blanford 1890 in 1893 Forbes  made the first strong plea for this continent The flood of evi H O Forbes Geographical Journal 1893 Also Natural Science 1893 p 54 565 dence for the Antarctica theory has now become so strong that only a few de tails can be mentioned Forbes 1893 and MilneEdwards from the consideration of the birds Beddard 1895 from the study of worms and other invertebrates Moore 1899 from the study of the flora of South Africa Spencer 1896 from the study of the fauna of Australia Ameghino Hatcher and Ortmann from studies and collections of vertebrate and invertebrate fossils in Patagonia not yet fully published Moreno 1899 from the discovery of Miolania an Australian fossil reptile recently found in South America From these and many other sources has been brought forth the body of testimony which draws us almost irresistibly  to the conclusion that there was an Antarctic continent at various times connecting South America South Africa Australia and New Zealand Such a con nection strengthens Huxleys conception announced in 1868 that the zoological re gions were mainly upon lines of latitude rather than as suggested by the present configuration of the earth upon lines of longitude With the theoretical elevation of this submerged continent Chart III which may be called the Antarctic Re gion so as to connect the southern land masses at various times all present and past geographical distribution may be the oretically accounted for Elevation to the 10000 foot 3040 meter line still leaves a broad channel south of Africa Without such elevation we are still met by many in superable difficulties Among other problems a land connection between Africa and South America across the South Atlantic enables us to explain the remarkable distribution of the sirenia seacows dugongs and manatees now found exclusively in the tropical belt of Africa and the Americas See Sirenia Chart  After discussing the evidence with great

arboreal forms like the Opossum If we can draw a par allel with the adaptive radiation of the CHART IIIRestoration of Antarctica by elevation to the 3040 sounding line showing old continental lines

that the Jurassic Mam mals of England and Wyoming embrace primitive placentals or Insectivores as well as Marsupials and Multituberculates  Monotremes is now generally accepted placentals during the 3000000 years more or less of the Tertiary we may safely con clude that such a primitive family entering the Australian region during the Cretaceous period eitherby way of Antarctica Spencer or by way of the Oriental region Wallace and Lydekker might have peopled Aus tralia with all its wonderfully diversified forms of Marsupial life The Didelphyidae are to the Marsupials what the Creodonts are to

NOTOGEA by either of these routes North America is the only part of the globe whereCretaceous mammals are known at present In the late Cretaceous we ap pear to discover evidence of the existence lieved to be related to the HYRACOIDEA upon the affinities of these forms turns the problem whether South America derived the sources of its great radiation from Africa or from South America See Chart IV CHART IVOrder of Mammals placed in their hypothetical chief centers of adaptive radiation during the Tertiary Period of the following orders Insectivora Creo donta or ancestral Carnivores hoofed ani mals or Amblypoda and perhaps the earli est Monkeys or Mesodonta In the basal Eocene we certainly find primitive Mon keys or Mesodonta Rodentia and Taeni odonta or ancestral Edentata A land con nection with South America in the early Eocene would therefore have supplied Ne ogcea with the Edentates as well as the stem forms from which might have been derived its wonderful radiation of hoofed animals the LitopternaTypotheria and Toxodontia together with the remarkable radiation of the Hystricomorph or porcupinelike ro dents and of two families of Monkeys The exact zoological affinities of the oldest mammalian or Pyrotherium fauna of South America remain to be determined Pyrotherium itself is considered by Ame ghino 1895 as the source of the order PROBOSCIDIA while other ungulates are

this region with Africa via Antarctica this contact in addition to the problematical Proboscidia and Hyracoidea above alluded to apparently introduced stem forms of Edentates into the Ethiopian region from which were derived the Pangolins and Aard Varks these peculiar edentates together with Armadillos all occur in southern France in the lower Oligocene Fihol 1893 this land bridge also distributed the Cape Golden moles Chrysochloridce these facts and others too numerous to mention serve to show the vast importance of the ex plorations in Patagonia and make us im patient for the exact conclusions which are forthcoming from the materials brought together by Ameghino and Hatcher SCIENCE 567N S VOL XI No 276 The third migration into Neogaea estab lished its links with Australia bringing in Marsupials both polyprotodont and dipro todonts The fourth was from the north Arctogaea and is positively known it oc curred at the end of the Miocene and brought in the northern Carnivora Bears Wolves Cats and Sabretooth Tigers Rac coons and Mustelines the Artiodactyla deer and camels the Perissodactyla horses and tapirs three types of Rodents the Squirrels Mice and Hares or Rabbits and the Mastodon The Notog2eic types as well as the animals of the first invasion in the meantime had largely died out and the introduction of more vigorous Arctogaeic types especially the carnivores together with a change of climate exterminated a further portion of the autochthonous Neo gaeic fauna At the same time that is of this second invasion many of the South American forms entered North America they seem to have reached this continent in the upper Pliocene We now turn to ARCTOGAEA In the Eo cene period we find in Europe and North America what may be considered the pure or Autochthonous fauna of the Holarctic re gion in the absence of all knowledge of Asia Southern Asia is an absolute terra incognita the earliest known deposits in this region being in the Upper Oligocene in which the fauna is remarkably similar to that of Europe Northern Asia is un known paleontologically until the Pleisto cenehere is a region for explorers How ever we may consider it as part of a broad Eurasiatic land areaextending from the Rocky Mountain Region to Great Britain The faunal relations are astonishingly close between the new and old worlds at this time Every years discovery increases the resemblance and diminishes the differences between Europe and the Rocky Mountain region Distinguishing North America however are the Tylopoda this suborder includes the peculiar Artiodactyla of the Camelllama tribe these Professor Scott in a recent paper considers as including all the early types of American ruminants which we have been vainly endeavoring to compare with European types The radia tion of the Tylopod phylum into a great variety of types is quite conceivable and it is thoroughly consistent with the funda mental law of adaptive radiation which we find operating over and over again In Europe there are in the upper Eocene two classes of animals first those which have their ancestors in the older rocks The second class includes certain highly specialized animals which have no ances tors in the older rocksamong these per haps are the peculiar flying rodents or Anomaluridce now confined to Africa and secondly the highly specialized eventoed ruminant typesthe Anoplotheres Xipho donts and others the discovery of which in the Gypse near ParisCuvier has made famous It is tempting to imagine that these animals did not evolve in Europe but that they represent what may be called the first invasion of Europe by African types from the Ethiopian region It is a curious fact that the African con tinent as a great theater of adaptive radia tion of Mammalia has not been sufficiently considered It is true that it is the dark continent of paleontology for it has prac tically no fossil mammal history but it by no means follows that the Mammalia did not enjoy an extensive evolution there Although it is quite probable that this idea has been advanced beforemost writ ers speak mainly or exclusively of the in vasion of Africa by European types Blan ford and Allen it is true have especially dwelt upon the likeness of the Oriental and Ethiopian fauna but not in connection with its antecedent cause This cause I believe to have been mainly an invasion from south to north correlated with the northern ex 568 SCIENCAPRIL 13 1900 8sCENCE tension of Ethiopian climate and flora dur ing the Middle Tertiary It is in a less measure due to a migration from north to south Let us therefore clearly set forth the hypothesis of the Ethiopian region or South Africa as a great center of independ ent evolution and as the source of succes sive northward migrations of animals some of which ultimately reached even the ex tremity of South AmericaI refer to the Mastodons This hypothesis is clearly im plied if not stated by Blanford in 1876 in his paper upon the African element in the fauna of India The first of these migrations we may suppose brought in certain highly special ized ruminants of the upper Eocene the Anomalures or peculiar flying rodents of Africa with this invasion may have come the Pangolins and Aard varks and pos sibly certain Armadillos Dasypodidce if M Filhols identification of Necrodasypus is cor rect A second invasion of great distinct ness may be that which marks the begin ning of the Miocene when the Mastodons and Dinotheres first appear in Europe also the earliest of the Antelopes A third in vasion may be represented in the base of the Pliocene by the increasing number of Antelopes the great giraffes of the Egean plateau and in the upper Pliocene by the Hippopotami With these forms came the rhinoceroses with no incisor or cut ting teeth similar to the smaller African Rhinoceros R bicormis Another recently discovered African immigrant upon the Island of Samos in the Egean plateau is Pliohyrax or Leptodon a very large member of the Hyracoidea probably aquatic in its habits indicating that this order popularly known as the conies enjoyed an extensive adaptive radiation in Tertiary times It thus appears that the Proboscidia Hyracoidea certain edentata the Ante lopes the Giraffes the Hippopotami the most specialized ruminants and among the rodents the Anomalures the Dormice the Jerboas and among Monkeys the Baboons may have enjoyed their original adaptive radiation in Africathat they survived after the glacial period only in the Oriental or IndoMalayan region and that this ac counts for the marked community of fauna between this region and the Ethiopian as observed by Blanford and Allen Against the prevalent theory of Oriental origin of these animals is first the fact observed by Blanford and Lydekker in the Bugti Beds Sind that the Oligocene or lower Miocene fauna of the Orient is markedly European in type second that if these animals had originated in Asia some of them would have found their way to North America third the fact that all these animals appear suddenly and without any known ancestors in older geological formations These are the main facts in favor of the Ethiopian migration hypothesis In the meantime the unification of the North American and Eurasiatic regions was proceeding by intermigration In the lower Oligocene the giant pigs or elotheres the Tapirs and peculiar amphibious rhinoc eroses known as Amynodons found their way from America to Europe while Europe supplied us with a few Anthracotheres both Anthracotherium and Hyopotamus In the Miocene Europe sent us the true Cats and we supplied Europe with the de structive sabre tooth tigers in the upper Miocene Europe sent us our first deer and cattle or Cervidce and Bovidce also probably the Mastodons en route from Africa In the Pliocene we supplied Europe with the rab bits and hares and possibly with the rac coons if the Panda belongs to this family In the Pleistocene the Camels wandered into Asia from America while the Bears passed them en route to America These are a few instances out of many which are already well known On the other hand certain families had an 569N S VOL XI No 276 exclusively Eurasiatic history so far as we know These are among animals related to the horse and tapir the Palieotheres and Lophiodon among ruminants the Tragu line deer and Muntjacs among insectivores the hedgehogs among primates the An thropoid Apes and the lemurs The latter are peculiar to the Malagasy and Ethiopian regions At the same time America ex clusively raised the Titanotheres the Hy racodontidce or cursorial rhinoceroses the pouched rodents or Geomyidce all the early families of Tylopoda the peccaries It is paradoxical that so many animals which we are wont to consider typically American came from the Eurasiatic region while so many others which we always associate with Asia and Africa came from this country Herein lies the necessity of a paleontolog ical basis for zoogeography PLEISTOCENE DIVISIONS IN EUROPE The Pleistocene Quaternary or Glacial Age is the period in which the present dis tribution of animals and plants was de termined In this period the fulness of European investigation is in strongest con trast with the indecisive results of Amer ican work and in no other period can we anticipate more weighty inductions from Holarctic correlation It is especially im portant to determine the relative antiquity of the first recorded traces of man in the two continents It is true the Pleistocene history of Europe is still in a formative stage but it is absolutely evident that a final and posi tive time scale and subdivision of the early Age of Man is not far distant and that the vast labors of geologists botanists zoolo gists paleontologists and anthropologists will be rewarded with a harmonious theory of all its phenomena Combined attack by geological and bi ological methods has nowhere produced  A Titanothere is reported in Roumania more brilliant results The unaided testi mony of the rocks and soils fails to tell us of the successive advances and retreats of the ice but where owing to the obliteration of surface deposits geology is in confusion plant and animal life serves both biology and meteorology like a vast thermometer actually recording within a few degrees the repeated rise and fall of temperature This record consists of the invading and re treating life waves of river forest field barren ground steppe tundra and arctic types with increasing cold or the reversed order with diminishing cold in the same localities or geographical areas There seems to be sufficient evidence for a main division of the Pleistocene as follows Upper Pleistocene Postglacial f Upper  Middle Pleistocene  Middle Glacial L Lower J Lower Pleistocene  Preglacial Briefly the prevailing views in Europe as to the glacial age are told in Chart V 1 The preglacial stage presents a min gling of south temperate temperate and northern forms of mammals 2 The long first glacial advance was followed Pohlig by the Rixdorf stage intermorainal colder than the succeeding Mosbach and Thuringian stages which have a more temperate facies in the recurrence of some of the Forest Bed Fauna 3 The faunal evidence for a colder midglacial period is conclusive The evi dence for a second or midglacial advance between the first and last great glacial stages is mainly biological that is sub arctic are followed by more temperate life forms as we gather largely from studies of the rodent fauna by Nehring Studer and others The hypothesis of three distinct glacial advances and of two interglacial re treats rests therefore upon a combination of geological and biological evidence which is not as yet conclusive 570 SCIENCEAPRIL 13 1900 SCIENCE 4 There followed the postglacial neo lithic alluvial stage Geographically the beginning of the Ple istocene is remarkable for its broad land connections and it represents the last stage of that community of fauna which during the Pliocene distinguished the entire region of Europe Asia Africa and North America These connections may all be restored by

find the first arctic and sub arctic types of animals in central Europe MiddleStageThis stage Mosbach Sands Essex marks the recurrence of a more tem perate climate first observed by Lyell and Evans in England and abundantly known in Germany and France Two only of the characteristic Pliocene species recur the hippopotamus and straighttusked elephant These alone have been universally cited as evidence of a south temperate or even of a tropical climate but the more numerous hardy types which are found in this stage constitute still stronger proofs of a north temperate climate Geologically the deposits are of fluviatile origin consisting of river sands and gravels containing Hippopotamus Rhinoceros merckii and Mammoth The great beaver Trogon therium cuvieri makes its last appearance here Geographically the southern conti nental depression has not begun and the Lower Pleistocene land bridges persistedAPRIL 13 1900 SCIENCE The Mosbach and Essex fauna give the following percentages 4 Pliocene species including two living types 7 Pleistocene species now extinct 16 Living species including 2 Pliocene species The characteristic Pleistocene types which are first recorded in Mosbach are early varieties of the Irish Red and Roe deer the moose and the cave lion Felis spelcea Among the living species recorded for the first time or making their first appearance at this stage are the Reindeer Boar Horse Lynx Badger and Marmot Upper StageAccording to Pohlig the midPleistocene proper or succeeding stage was characterized by volcanic disturbances in central Europe and by the deposition of gypsum and tufas Probably these earth movements were connected with the marked geographical changes brought about by widespread depression of the continental borders and isolation which the same au thor assigns to this period The fauna typically represented in the Thuringian tufas indicates a cooler or north temperate climate Elephas antiquus is very abundant making its last appearance north of Italy The typical locality is the Thuringian tufa in which Pohlig records 61 species Par allel with this is the Taubach near Weimar fauna In 1895 Nehring reported from this level what he regarded as the oldest human re mains thus far found in Europe consisting of two very large molar teeth resembling in some respects those of the Chimpanzee this man he considered of the Ch6leen type In the same year Newton described a hu man skeleton of Esquimaux type in the still older  Higher Terraces  or Hippopota mus level of Kent England The antiquity of this skeleton is however rendered some what doubtful by the fact that the skull is of much newer type than those of Nean derthal and of Spy and the evidence for its extreme paleolithic age is not considered absolutely conclusive The faunal list is provisionally analyzed as follow 3 Pliocene species still living Castor Hymena Arvi cola 7 Pleistocene species now extinct 23 Living species including living Pleistocene Northern types The number of recorded living species increases there being a marked increase especially in the number of Reindeer The most important new living types are the steppe antelope Saiga prisca tartarica the moose Alces machlis the lemming Myyodes lennmus the Siberian jerboa Alactaga saliens the porcupine Iystrix the rabbit Lepus timidus These constitute a distinct inva sion of north Asiatic forms to the southern steppes 2 Upper MidPleistocene or Elephas primi genius Stage PohligAs we enter the next succeeding Loess and Cave Period of Central Europe the main life stage of the mammoth Elephas primigenius the wooly rhinoceros Rhinoceros antiquitatis or tichorhinus and the reindeer Rangifer tarandus we note the de cline of the broadnosed rhinoceros Rhino ceros merckii and the absence of the straight tusked elephant Elephas antiquusin geological deposits which are chiefly diluvial gravels and sand clays These facts alone indicate a prolonged colder period a north temperate or boreal climate The fauna presents a great variety adapted to different degrees of temperature but decidedly of northern type Other facts indicate that this colder period was initiated by a distinct advance of the ice followed by a gradual recession namely the occurrence of arctic and subarctic types succeeded by north temperate types in a number of localities typically near Schaff hausen Nehring Steinmann Schlosser These successive northern faunas in single localities are typically as follows 1 Tundre Fauna 2 Steppe Fauna 3 Forest Fauna 573N S VOL XI No 276 Europe now included a most remarkable diversity of life of Asiatic North Siberian Oriental and African origin The climate was cold and relatively dry The Reindeer first the barren ground then the woodland variety increased rapidly in number during this period and constituted its most distinc tive form hence this is known as the Rein deer period This stage is famous for the skeletons of man the man of Neanderthal and Spy very primitive in the structure of the skull the oldest human skeletal remains with the ex ception of the Pithecanthropus of Java III Upper Pleistocene Postglacial As above observed there is a difference of opinion as to the interglacial or postglacial age of the loess All the North Siberian Oriental and African types gradually dis appear the modern European forest and field fauna alone survives There is some evidence that both the Mammoth and Rein deer lived for a time in this period the latter being now confined to more northern Europe The Irish deer Megaceros hibernice the Reindeer the bovidae Bos taurus Bos longifrons and Bos brachyceros are the char acteristic ruminants Alces palmatus is a postglacial Russian moose The horse E caballus of larger and smaller varieties was now domesticated and used for food The carnivora rodentia and insectivora were all of modern type The detailed comparison of the Pleisto cene of Europe America and Asia is still under way and very important results may be expected from it It will be equally ser viceable to American anthropologists and paleontologists for our own Pleistocene is far from being understood The stages represented by our horse or Equus Beds which are usually considered Lower Pleis tocene as well as of the Megalonyx and Cave Fauna of the East remain to be exactly fixed Interest in this problem is greatly enhanced by the fact that we may at any moment discover the remains of man or of his ancestors associated with Equus excelsus and positively demonstrate the existence of man upon this continent at a period con temporaneous with his first appearance in Europe HENRY FAIRFIELD OSBORN CRUISE OF THE ALBATROSS IV MR AGASSIZS final letter to the U S Fish Commission on the voyage of the Al batross is dated Yokohama Japan March 5 1900 After coaling and refitting we left Suva on the 19th of December and arrived at Funafuti on the 23d stopping on the way at Nurakita the southernmost of the Ellice Islands I was of course greatly inter ested in my visit of Funafuti where a bor ing had been made under the direction of a committee of the Royal Society in charge of Professor David of Sydney after the first attempt under Professor Sollas had failed The second boring reached a depth of more than 1100 feet This is not the place to discuss the bearing of the work done at Funafiuti as beyond the fact of the depth reached we have as yet no final statement by the committee of the interpretation put upon the detailed examination of the core obtained and now in the hands of Professor Judd and his assistants In addition to the abovenamed islands we also examnined Nukufetau another of the Ellice group After leaving Nukufetau we encountered nothing but bad weather which put a stop to all our work until we arrived under the lee of Arorai the southernmost of the Gil bert Islands On our way to Tapateuea from there we steamed to Apamama and Maiana which we examined as well as Tarawa We next examined Maraki an atoll which is nearly closed with high 574 SCIENCE

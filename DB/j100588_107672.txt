J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107672,ON THE ELECTRICAL PHENOMENA EXHIBITED IN VACUO,I206977,L 64 J VIII ON THE ELECTRICALPHENOMENA EXHIBITED IN VACUO BY SIR HUMPHRY DAVY BART P R S READ DECEMBER SO 1821 THE PRODUCTION OF HEAT AND LIGHT BY ELECTRICAL DISCHARGES THE MANNER IN WHICH CHEMICAL ATTRACTIONS ARE PRODUCED DE STROYED OR MODIFIED BY CHANGES IN THE ELECTRICAL STATES OF BODIES AND THE LATE IMPORTANT DISCOVERY OF THE CONNECTION OF MAGNETISM WITH ELECTRICITY HAVE OPENED AN EXTENSIVE FIELD OF ENQUIRY IN PHYSICAL SCIENCE AND HAVE RENDERED INVESTIGATIONS CONCERNING THE NATURE OF ELECTRICITY AND THE LAWS BY WHICH IT IS GOVERNED AND THE PROPERTIES THAT IT COMMUNICATES TO BODIES MUCH MORE INTERESTING THAN AT ANY FORMER PERIOD OF THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY IS ELECTRICITY A SUBTILE ELASTIC FLUID  OR ARE ELECTRICAL EFFECTS MERELY THE EXHIBITION OF THE ATTRACTIVE POWERS OF THE PARTICLES OF BODIES  ARE HEAT AND LIGHT ELEMENTS OF ELECTRICITY OR MERELY THE EFFECTS OF ITS ACTION IS MAGNETISM IDENTICAL WITH ELECTRICITY OR AN INDEPENDENT AGENT PUT INTO MOTION OR ACTI VITY BY ELECTRICITY   QUERIES OF THIS KIND MIGHT BE CONSIDER ABLY MULTIPLIED AND STATED IN MORE PRECISE AND VARIOUS FORMS THE SOLUTION OF THEM IT MUST BE ALLOWED IS OF THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE AND THOUGH SOME PERSONS HAVE UNDER TAKEN TO ANSWER THEM IN THE MOST POSITIVE MANNER YET THERE ARE I BELIEVE FEW SAGACIOUS REASONERS WHO THINK THAT OUR PRESENT DATA ARE SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE US TO DECIDE ON SUCH VERY ABSTRUSE AND DIFFICULT PARTS OF CORPUSCULAR PHILOSOPHYON THE ELECTRICAL PHENOMENA EXHIBITED IN VACUO IT APPEARED TO ME AN OBJECT OF CONSIDERABLE MOMENT AND ONE INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH ALL THESE QUERIES THE RELATIONS OF ELECTRICITY TO SPACE AS NEARLY VOID OF MATTER AS IT CAN BE MADE ON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH AND IN CONSEQUENCE I UNDERTOOK SOME EXPERIMENTS ON THE SUBJECT IT IS WELL KNOWN TO THE FELLOWS OF THIS SOCIETY WHO HAVE CONSIDERED THE SUBJECT OF ELECTRICITY THAT MR WALSH BELIEVED THAT THE ELECTRICAL LIGHT WAS NOT PRODUCIBLE IN A PERFECT TOR RICELLIAN VACUUM AND THAT MR MORGAN DREW THE SAME INFERENCE FROM HIS RESEARCHES AND LIKEWISE CONCLUDED THAT SUCH A VACUUM PREVENTED THE CHARGING OF COATED GLASS NOW IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT IN THE MOST PERFECT VACUUM THAT CAN BE MADE IN THE TORRICELLIAN TUBE VAPOUR OF MERCURY THOUGH OF EXTREMELY SMALL DENSITY EXISTS I COULD NOT HELP THEREFORE ENTERTAINING A DOUBT AS TO THE PERFECT ACCURACY OF THESE RESULTS AND I RESOLVED NOT ONLY TO EXAMINE THEM EXPE RIMENTALLY BUT LIKEWISE BY USING A COMPARATIVELY FIXED METAL IN FUSION FOR MAKING THE VACUUM TO EXCLUDE AS FAR AS WAS POSSIBLE THE PRESENCE OF ANY VOLATILE MATTER THE APPARATUS THAT I EMPLOYED WAS EXTREMELY SIMPLE PI V AND CONSISTED OF A CURVED GLASS TUBE WITH ONE LEG CLOSED AND LONGER THAN THE OTHER IN THIS CLOSED LEG A WIRE OF PLATINUM WAS HERMETICALLY CEMENTED FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRANSMITTING THE ELECTRICITY OR TO ASCERTAIN THE POWER OF THE VACUUM TO RECEIVE A CHARGE IT WAS COATED WITH FOIL OF TIN OR PLATINUM THE OPEN END WHEN THE CLOSED LEG HAD BEEN FILLED WITH MERCURY OR ANY OTHER METAL WAS EXHAUSTED EITHER BY BEING PLACED UNDER THE RECEIVER OR CONNECTED WITH THE STOP COCK OF AN EXCELLENT AIR PUMP AND IN SOME CASES TO ENSURE MDCCCXXII K 65SIR HUMPHRY DAVY ON THE GREATER ACCURACY THE EXHAUSTION WAS MADE AFTER THE TUBE AND APPARATUS HAD BEEN FILLED WITH HYDROGENE OPERATING IN THIS WAY IT WAS EASY TO PROCURE A VACUUM EITHER OF A LARGE OR SMALL SIZE FOR THE RAREFIED AIR OR GAS COULD BE MADE TO BALANCE A COLUMN OF FLUID METAL OF ANY LENGTH FROM 20 INCHES TO THE 9OTH OF AN INCH AND BY USING ONLY A SMALL QUANTITY OF METAL IT COULD BE MORE EASILY PURGED OF AIR I SHALL FIRST MENTION THE RESULTS I OBTAINED WITH QUICKSILVER I FOUND THAT BY USING RECENTLY DISTILLED QUICKSILVER IN THE TUBES AND BOILING IT IN VACUO SIX OR SEVEN TIMES FROM THE TOP TO THE BOTTOM AND FROM THE BOTTOM TO THE TOP MAKING IT VIBRATE REPEATEDLY BY STRIKING IT WITH A SMALL PIECE OF WOOD A COLUMN WAS OBTAINED IN THE TUBE FREE FROM THE SMALLEST PARTICLE OF AIR BUT A PHENOMENON OCCURRED IN DISCOVERING THE CAUSE OF WHICH I HAD A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE WHEN I USED A SHORT TUBE OF FOUR OR FIVE INCHES LONG ONLY I FOUND THAT AFTER CONTINUED BOILING AND MUCH AGITATION OF THE MER CURY THOUGH THERE WAS NO APPEARANCE OF ELASTIC MATTER WHEN THE MERCURY ADHERED STRONGLY IN THE UPPER PART OF THE TUBE YET THAT AFTER ELECTRIZATION OR EVEN ON SUFFERING THE MERCURY TO PASS SLOWLY BACK INTO THE CLOSED PART A MINUTE GLOBULAR SPACE SOMETIMES APPEARED I THOUGHT AT FIRST THAT THIS WAS AIR WHICH THOUGH SO HIGHLY RAREFIED AS IT MUST HAVE BEEN BY THE EXHAUSTION ADHERED TO THE MERCURY AND I ENDEAVOURED BY LONG BOILING THE MERCURY IN AN EXHAUSTED DOUBLE SYPHON AND MAKING THE VACUUM IN ONE OF THE CURVES TO PREVENT EN TIRELY THE PRESENCE OF AIR BUT THE PHENOMENON ALWAYS OCCURRED WHEN THERE WAS NO STRONG ADHESION OF THE MERCURY  THE FIGURE WILL BEST EXPLAIN THE FORM OF THE APPARATUS 66ELECTRICAL PHENOMENA HIBITED IN VACUO TO THE GLASS THIS AND ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE NAMELY THAT WHEN THE LEG IN WHICH THE TORRICELLIAN VACUUM WAS MADE WAS 15 OR 16 INCHES LONG THE PHENOMENON WAS VERY RARELY PER CEPTIBLE AND ALWAYS DISAPPEARED WHEN THE TUBE WAS INVERTED AND THE MERCURY MADE TO STRIKE THE TOP WITH SOME FORCE LED ME TO CONCLUDE THAT THE MINUTE SPACE WAS REALLY FILLED WITH THE VAPOUR OF MERCURY THE ATTRACTION OF THE PARTICLES OF THE FLUID MERCURY FOR EACH OTHER PREVENTING THEIR ACTUAL CONTACT WITH THE GLASS EXCEPT WHEN THIS CONTACT WAS FOICIBLY MADE BY MECHANICAL MEANS AND I SOON PROVED THAT THIS WAS THE CASE FOR BY CAUSING THE MERCURY WHEN ITS COLUMN WAS SHORT TO DESCEND INTO THE MORE PERFECT FROM THE LESS PERFECT VACUUM WITH MORE OR LESS VELOCITY I COULD MAKE THE SPACE MORE OR LESS OR CAUSE ITS DISAPPEARANCE ALTOGETHER IN WHICH LAST CASE THE COHESION BETWEEN THE MERCURY AND THE GLASS WAS ALWAYS EXTREMELY STRONG I FOUND THAT IN ALL CASES WHEN THE MERCURIAL VACUUM WAS PERFECT IT WAS PERMEABLE TO ELECTRICITY AND WAS RENDERED LUMINOUS BY EITHER THE COMMON SPARK OR THE SHOCK FROM A LEYDEN JAR AND THE COATED GLASS SURROUNDING IT BECAME CHARGED BUT THE DEGREE OF INTENSITY OF THESE PHENOMENA DEPENDED UPON THE TEMPERATURE WHEN THE TUBE WAS VERY HOT THE ELECTRIC LIGHT APPEARED IN THE VAPOUR OF A BRIGHT GREEN COLOUR AND OF GREAT DENSITY AS THE TEMPERATURE DIMINISHED IT LOST ITS VIVIDNESS AND WHEN IT WAS ARTIFICIALLY COOLED TO 20 BELOW ZERO OF FAHRENHEIT IT WAS SO FAINT AS TO REQUIRE CONSIDERABLE DARKNESS TO BE PERCEPTIBLE THE CHARGE LIKEWISE COMMUNICATED TO THE TIN OR PLATINUM FOIL WAS HIGHER THE HIGHER THE TEMPERATURE WHICH LIKE THE OTHER PHENOMENON MUST DEPEND UPON THE DIFFERENT DENSITY OF 67SIR HUMPHRY DAVY ON THE THE VAPOUR OF MERCURY AND AT O FAHRENHEIT IT WAS VERY FEEBLE INDEED A VERY BEAUTIFUL PHENOMENON OCCURRED IN BOILING THE MERCURY IN THE EXHAUSTED TUBE WHICH SHOWED THE GREAT BRIL LIANCY OF THE ELECTRICAL LIGHT IN PURE DENSE VAPOUR OF MER CURY IN THE FORMATION AND CONDENSATION OF THE GLOBULES OF MERCURIAL VAPOUR THE ELECTRICITY PRODUCED BY THE FRICTION OF THE MERCURY AGAINST THE GLASS WAS DISCHARGED THROUGH THE VAPOUR WITH SPARKS SO BRIGHT AS TO BE VISIBLE IN DAY LIGHT IN ALL CASES WHEN THE MINUTEST QUANTITY OF RARE AIR WAS INTRODUCED INTO THE MERCURIAL VACUUM THE COLOUR OF THE LIGHT PRODUCED BY THE PASSAGE OF THE ELECTRICITY CHANGED FROM GREEN TO SEA GREEN AND BY INCREASING THE QUANTITY TO BLUE AND PURPLE AND WHEN THE TEMPERATURE WAS LOW THE VACUUM BECAME A MUCH BETTER CONDUCTOR I TRIED TO GET RID OF A PORTION OF THE MERCURIAL VAPOUR BY USING A DIFFICULTLY FUSIBLE AMALGAM OF MERCURY AND TIN WHICH WAS MADE TO CRYSTALLIZE BY COOLING IN THE TUBE BUT THE RE SULTS WERE PRECISELY THE SAME AS WHEN PURE MERCURY WAS USED I TRIED TO MAKE A VACUUM ABOVE THE FUSIBLE ALLOY OF BIS MUTH BUT I FOUND IT SO LIABLE TO OXIDATE AND DIRT THE TUBE THAT I SOON RENOUNCED FARTHER ATTEMPTS OF THIS KIND ON A VACUUM ABOVE FUSED TIN I MADE A NUMBER OF EXPERI MENTS AND BY USING FRESHLY CUT PIECES OF GRAIN TIN AND FUSING THEM IN A TUBE MADE VOID AFTER BEING FILLED WITH HYDRO GENE AND BY LONG CONTINUED HEAT AND AGITATION I HAD A COLUMN OF FUSED TIN WHICH APPEARED ENTIRELY FREE FROM GAS YET THE VACUUM MADE ABOVE THIS EXHIBITED THE SAME PHENO MENA AS THE MERCURIAL VACUUM AT TEMPERATURES BELOW O THE LIGHT WAS YELLOW AND OF THE PALEST PHOSPHORESCENT KIND 68ELECTRICALPHENOMENA EXHIBITED IN VACUO REQUIRING ALMOST ABSOLUTE DARKNESS TO BE PERCEIVED AND IT WAS NOT PERCEPTIBLY INCREASED BY HEAT I MADE TWO EXPERIMENTS ON ELECTRICAL AND MAGNETIC REPUL SIONS AND ATTRACTIONS IN THE MERCURIAL VACUUM BY ATTACHING TO THE PLATINUM WIRE TWO FINE WIRES IN ONE CASE OF PLATINUM IN THE OTHER OF STEEL TERMINATED BY MINUTE SPHERULES OF THE SAME METALS I FOUND THAT THEY REPELLED EACH OTHER WHEN THE WIRE WAS ELECTRIFIED IN THE MOST PERFECT MERCURIAL VACUUM AS THEY WOULD HAVE DONE IN USUAL CASES AND THE STEEL GLOBULES WERE AS OBEDIENT TO THE MAGNET AS IN THE AIR WHICH LAST RESULT IT WAS EASY TO ANTICIPATE IN SOME OF THE FIRST OF THESE EXPERIMENTS I USED A WIRE FOR CONNECTING THE METAL WITH THE STOPCOCK BUT LATTERLY THE RAREFIED AIR OR GAS WAS THE ONLY CHAIN OF COMMUNICATION AND THIS CIRCUMSTANCE ENABLED ME TO ASCERTAIN THAT THE FEEBLE NESS OF THE LIGHT IN THE MORE PERFECT VACUUM WAS NOT OWING MERELY TO A SMALLER QUANTITY OF ELECTRICITY PASSING THROUGH IT FOR THE SAME DISCHARGE WHICH PRODUCED A FAINT GREEN LIGHT IN THE UPPER PART OF THE TUBE PRODUCED A BRIGHT PURPLE LIGHT IN THE LOWER PART AND A STRONG SPARK IN THE ATMOSPHERE THE BOILING POINT OF PURE OLIVE OIL IS NOT MUCH BELOW THAT OF MERCURY AND THE BUTTER OR CHLORIDE OF ANTIMONY ANTI MONANE BOILS AT ABOUT 388 FAHRENHEIT I TRIED BOTH THESE SUBSTANCES IN THE VACUUM AND FOUND AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED THAT THE LIGHT PRODUCED BY THE ELECTRICITY PASSING THROUGH THE VAPOUR OF THE CHLORIDE WAS MUCH MORE BRILLIANT THAN THAT PRODUCED BY IT IN PASSING THROUGH THE VAPOUR OF THE OIL AND IN THE LAST IT WAS MORE BRILLIANT THAN IN THE VAPOUR OF MER CURY AT COMMON TEMPERATURES THE LIGHTS WERE OF DIFFERENT COLOURS BEING OF A PURE WHITE IN THE VAPOUR OF THE CHLORIDE 69SIR HUTMPIRY DAVY OL THE AND OF A RED INCLINED TO PURPLE IN THAT OF THE OIL AND IN BOTH CASES PERMANENT ELASTIC FLUID WAS PRODUCED BY ITS TRANS MISSION THE LAW OF THE DIMINUTION OF THE DENSITY OF VAPOURS BY DIMINUTION OF TEMPERATURE HAS NOT BEEN ACCURATELYR ASCER TAINED  BUTI HAVENO DOUBT FROM THE EXPERIMENTS OF MR DALTON AND SOME I HAVE MADE MYSELF THAT IT IS REPRE SENTED BY A GEOMETRICAL PROGRESSION THE DECREMENTS OF TEM PERATURE BEING IN ARITHMETICAL PROGRESSION AND IN THREE PURE FLUIDS THAT I OPERATED UPON THE RATIO SEEMED NEARLY UNIFORM FOR THE SAME NUMBER OF DEGREES BELOW THE BOILING POINT AND TAKING INTERVALS OF 20 DEGREES OF TEMPERATURE 369416 UPON THIS DATUM AND CONSIDERING THE BOILING POINTS OF MERCURY TO BE 600 THAT OF OIL 540 THAT OF THE CHLORIDE OF ANTIMONY 34O AND THAT OF TIN 5000 ALL ABOVE 52 AND THE ELASTIC FORCE OF VAPOUR OF WATER AT THIS TEMPERATURE TO BE EQUAL TO RAISE BY ITS PRESSURE ABOUT 45 PARTS OF AN INCH OF MERCURY THE RELATIVE STRENGTHS OF VAPOUR WILL BE FOR MER CURY OOOO15615 FOR OIL OO06819 FOR CHLORIDE OF ANTIMONY O1692 AND FOR TIN 370C5 PRECEDED BY 48 ZEROST IT IS NOT KNOWN WHETHER THE VAPOUR FROM SOLIDS FOLLOWS A SIMILAR LAW OF PROGRESSION AS THAT FROM FLUIDS AND THESE NUMBERS ARE ONLY GIVEN TO SW HOW HOW MINUTE THE QUANTITY OF MATTER MUST BE IN VAPOURS WHERE ITS EFFECTS ARE DISTINCT UPON ELECTRICAL PHENOMENA  AND HOW MUCH MORE MINUTE IT MUST BE IN THE CASE OF MERCURY ARTIFICIALLY COOLED AND ALMOST BE YOND IMAGINATION SO IN VAPOURS FROM SUBSTANCES REQUIRING VERY ELEVATED TEMPERATURES FOR THEIR EBULLITION  WATER CHLORIDE OF PHOSPHORUS AND ALCOHOL OR CARBURET OF SULPHUR T I AM OBLIGED TO CHARLES BABBAGE ESQ F R S FOR THESE CALCULATIONS 70ELECTRICALPHENOMENA EXHIBITED IN VACUO I MADE SOME COMPARATIVE EXPERIMENTS TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER BELOW THE FREEZING POINT OF WATER THE DIMINUTION OF THE TEM PERATURE OF THE TORRICELLIAN VACUUM DIMINISHED ITS POWER OF TRANSMITTING ELECTRICITY OR OF BEING RENDERED LUMINOUS BY IT TO ABOUT 2O THIS APPEARED TO BE THE CASE BUT BETWEEN 2O ABOVE AND 20O DEGREES BELOW ZERO THE LOWEST TEMPERATURE I COULD PRODUCE BY POUNDED ICE AND MURIATE OF LIME IT SEEMED STATIONARY AND AS WELL AS I COULD DETERMINE THE ELECTRICAL PHENOMENA WERE NEARLY OF THE SAME INTENSITY AS THOSE PRO DUCED IN THE VACUUM ABOVE TIN UNLESS THE ELECTRICAL MACHINE WAS VERY ACTIVE NO LIGHT WAS VISIBLE DURING THE TRANSMISSION OF THE ELECTRICITY BUT THAT THIS TRANSMISSION TOOK PLACE WAS EVIDENT FROM THE LUMINOUS APPEARANCE OF THE RAREFIED AIR IN THE OTHER PARTS OF THE SYPHON AND FROM THE DIMINUTION OF THE REPULSION OF THE BALL OF THE QUADRANT ELECTROMETER ATTACHED TO THE PRIME CONDUCTOR WHEN THE MACHINE WAS IN GREAT ACTIVITY THERE WAS A PALE PHOSPHO RESCENT LIGHT ABOVE AND A SPARK ON THE MERCURY BELOW AND BRILLIANT LIGHT IN THE COMMON VACUUM A LEYDEN JAR WEAKLY CHARGED COULD NOT BE MADE TO TRANSMIT ITS ELECTRICITY BY EXPLOSION THROUGH THE COOLED TORRICELLIAN VACUUM BUT THIS ELECTRICITY WAS SLOWLY DISSIPATED THROUGH IT AND WHEN STRONGLY CHARGED THE SPARK PASSED THROUGH NEARLY AS MUCH SPACE AS IN COMMON AIR AND WITH A LIGHT VISIBLE IN THE SHADE AT ALL TEMPERATURES BELOW 200OO THE MERCURIAL VACUUM WAS A MUCH WORSE CONDUCTOR THAN HIGHLY RAREFIED AIR AND WLLEN THE TUBE CONTAINING IT WAS INCLUDED IN THE EXHAUSTED RECEIVER ITS TEMPERATURE BEING ABOUT 5O THE SPARK PASSED THROUGH A DISTANCE SIX TIMES GREATER IN THE BOYLEAN THAN IN THE MER CURIAL VACUUM IT IS EVIDENT FROM THESE GENERAL RESULTS THAT THE LIGHT AND 717X SIR HUMPHRY DAVY ON THE PROBABLY THE HEAT GENERATED IN ELECTRICAL DISCHARGES DEPENDS PRINCIPALLY ON SOME PROPERTIES OR SUBSTANCES BELONGING TO THE PONDERABLE MATTER THROUGH WHICH IT PASSES BUT THEY PROVE LIKEWISE THAT SPACE WHERE THERE IS NO APPRECIABLE QUANTITY OF THIS MATTER IS CAPABLE OF EXHIBITING ELECTRICAL PHENOMENA AND UNDER THIS POINT OF VIEW THEY ARE FAVOURABLE TO THE IDEA OF THE PHBENOMENA OF ELECTRICITY BEING PRODUCED BY A HIGHLY SUBTILE FLUID OR FLUIDS OF WHICH THE PARTICLES ARE REPULSIVE WITH RESPECT TO EACH OTHER AND ATTRACTIVE OF THE PARTICLES OF OTHER MATTER ON SUCH AN ABSTRUSE QUESTION HOWEVER THERE CAN BE NO DEMONSTRATIVE EVIDENCE IT MAY BE ASSUMED AS IN THE HYPOTHESIS OF HOOKE HUYGENS AND EULER THAT AN ETHEREAL MATTER SUSCEPTIBLE OF ELECTRICAL AFFECTIONS FILLS ALL SPACE OR THAT THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ELECTRICAL STATES MAY INCREASE THE FORCE OF VAPOUR FROM THE SUBSTANCES IN WHICH THEY EXIST AND THERE IS A FACT IN FAVOUR OF THIS LAST IDEA WHICH I HAVE OFTEN WITNESSEDWHEN THE VOLTAIC DIS CHARGE IS MADE IN THE BOYLEAN VACUUM EITHER FROM PLATINUM OR CHARCOAL IN CONTACT WITH MERCURY THE DISCHARGING SUR FACES REQUIRE TO BE BROUGHT VERY NEAR IN THE FIRST INSTANCE BUT THE ELECTRICITY MAY BE AFTERWARDS MADE TO PASS TO CONSI DERABLE DISTANCES THROUGH THE VAPOUR GENERATED FROM THE MERCURY OR CHARCOAL BY ITS AGENCY AND WHEN TWO SURFACES OF HIGHLY FIXED METAL SUCH AS PLATINUM OR IRON ARE USED THE DISCHARGE WILL PASS ONLY THROUGH A VERY SMALL DISTANCE AND CANNOT BE PERMANENTLY KEPT UP THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THE INTENSITY OF THE ELECTRICAL LIGHT IN THE MERCURIAL VACUUM DIMINISHES AS IT IS COOLED TO A CER TAIN POINT WHEN THE VAPOUR MUST BE OF ALMOST INFINITELY SMALL DENSITY AND IS THEN STATIONARY SEEMS STRONGLY OPPOSED TO THE IDEA THAT IT IS OWING TO ANY PERMANENT VAPOUR EMITTEDELECTRICAL PHENOMENA EXHIBITED IN VACUO CONSTANTLY BY THE MERCURY THE RESULTS WITH TIN MUST BE REGARDED AS MORE EQUIVOCAL BECAUSE AS THIS SUBSTANCE CANNOT BE BOILED IN VACUO IT MAY BE ALWAYS SUSPECTED TO HAVE EMITTED A SMALL QUANTITY OF THE RARE AIR OR GAS TO WHICH IT HAS BEEN EXPOSED YET SUPPOSING THIS CIRCUMSTANCE SUCH GAS MUST BE AT LEAST AS HIGHLY EXPANDED AS THE VAPOUR FROM COOLED MERCURY AND CAN HARDLY BE SUPPOSED CAPABLE OF AFFORD ING THE DENSE LIGHT WHICH THE PASSAGE OF THE ELECTRICITY OF THE CHARGED LEYDEN PHIAL THROUGH THE VACUUM PRODUCES WHEN THE INTENSE HEAT PRODUCED BY ELECTRICITY IS CONSI DERED AND THE STRONG ATTRACTIVE POWERS OF DIFFERENTLY ELEC TRIFIED SURFACES AND THE RAPIDITY OF THE CHANGES OF STATE IT DOES NOT SEEM AT ALL IMPROBABLE THAT THE SUPERFICIAL PARTICLES OF BODIES WHICH WHEN DETACHED BY THE REPULSIVE POWER OF HEAT FORM VAPOUR MAY BE LIKEWISE DETACHED BY ELECTRICAL POWERS AND THAT THEY MAY PRODUCE LUMINOUS APPEARANCES IN A VACUUM FREE FROM ALL OTHER MATTER BY THE ANNIHILATION OF THEIR OPPOSITE ELECTRICAL STATES IN COMMON CASES OF ELECTRICAL ACTION THE QUANTITY OF THE HEAT GENERATED BY THE ANNIHILATION OF THE DIFFERENT ELECTRICAL STATES DEPENDS AS I STATED IN MY LAST COMMUNICATION TO THE SOCIETY UPON THE NATURE OF THE MATTER ON WHICH IT ACTS AND IN CASES WHEN ELECTRICAL SPARKS ARE TAKEN IN FLUIDS VAPOUR OR GAS IS ALWAYS GENERATED AND IN ELASTIC FLUIDS THE INTENSITY OF THE LIGHT IS ALWAYS GREATER THE DENSER THE MEDIUM THE LUMINOUS APPEARANCES THEREFORE IT IS EVIDENT FROM ALL THE STATEMENTS MUST BE CONSIDERED AS SECONDARY WHILST THE UNI FORM EXERTIONS OF ELECTRICAL ATTRACTIONS AND REPULSIONS UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES IN RARE AND DENSE MEDIA AND IN VACUO AND WITH RESPECT TO SOLIDS FLUIDS AND GASES POINT THEM OUT WHE MDCCCXXII L 7374  SIR HUMPHRY DAVY ON THE THER THEY BE SPECIFIC AFFECTIONS OF A SUBTILE IMPONDERABLE FLUID OR PECULIAR PROPERTIES OF MATTER AS PRIMARY AND INVARIABLE ELECTRICAL PHENOMENA I HAVE MENTIONED IN THE LAST PAGE THE SUSPICION THAT MELTED TIN MAY CONTAIN AIR I SHALL CONCLUDE THIS PAPER BY STATING THE GROUNDS OF THIS SUSPICION AND NOTICING A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH APPEARS TO BE OF CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE BOTH IN RELATION TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF BAROMETERS AND THERMOMETERS AND TO THE ANALYSIS OF GASEOUS BODIES RECENTLY DISTILLED MERCURY THAT HAS BEEN AFTERWARDS BOILED AND COOLED IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND WHICH PRESENTS A PERFECTLY SMOOTH SURFACE IN A BAROMETER TUBE EMITS AIR WHEN STRONGLY HEATED IN VACUO AND THAT IN QUANTITIES SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE WHOLE INTERIOR OF THE TUBE WITH GLOBULES AND ON KEEPING THE STOPCOCK OF ONE OF THE TUBES USED IN THE EXPERIMENTS ON THE MERCURIAL VACUUM OPEN FOR SOME HOURS IT WAS FOUND THAT THE LOWER STRATUM OF MER CURY HAD IMBIBED AIR FOR WHEN HEATED IN VACUO IT EMITTED IT DISTINCTLY FROM A SPACE OF A QUARTER OF AN INCH OF TLHE CO LUMN SMALLER QUANTITIES WERE DISENGAGED FROM THE NEXT PART OF THE COLUMN AND ITS PRODUCTION CEASED AT ABOUT AN INCH HIGH IN THE TUBE THERE IS GREAT REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THIS AIR EXISTS IN MERCURY IN THE SAME INVISIBLE STATE AS IN WATER THAT IS DISTRIBUTED THROUGH ITS PORES AND THE FACT SHOWS THE NECESSITY OF LONG BOILING THE MERCURY IN BAROMETER AND THER MOMETER TUBES AND THE PROPRIETY OF EXPOSING AS SMALL A SUR FACE OF THE MERCURY AS POSSIBLE TO THE AIR IT MAY EXPLAIN LIKEWISE THE DIFFERENCE OF THE HEIGHTS OF THE MERCURY IN DIFFE

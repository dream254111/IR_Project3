Mexican boundary survey my attention was first called to a peculiar species of pine growing on the Pacific coast at the mouth of the Soledad valley San Diego county by a casual inquiry from Dr J L LeConte then staying in San Diego asking what pine it was grow ing near the ocean beach at that locality Not hav ing any specimens to show he simply mentioned at the time its dense cones and its long stout leaves five in a sheath Not long after an opportunity offered to the writer for a personal investigation having been ordered by Major W H Emory to make a geological examination of the reported coal deposits on the ocean bluff above Soledad From the notes and collections there made a description was drawn up dedicating this wellmarked new species to an honored friend and instructor both of Dr LeConte and the writer viz Iinus Torreyana Parry Of the few specimens then collected a single cone and bunch was sent to Dr Torrey to be figured for the Mexican boundary report While there it fell under the notice of some inquisitive botanist who extracted some of the loose seeds which were planted but by some in advertence were mixed with another threeleaved species When growing the two different kinds be caine confounded and it was inferred that the present discoverer was mistaken in regarding this species as fiveleaved Prof Parlatore the elaborator of Co niferae in de Candolles Prodromus added to this confusion by ignoring the name first proposed and substituting that of Pinus lophosperma Subse quently frequent collectors have visited this locality bearing away to the remotest portions of the world seed of this pine which as far as is known is exclu sively confined to a coastline of not more than four miles lying between San Iieguito and about a mile below Soledad and extending scarcely a mile inland The bulk of the treegrowth is here mainly confined to a series of high broken cliffs and deeply indented ravines on the bold headlands overlooking the sea south of Soledad valley and within the corporate lim its of the town of San Diego Here within a radius of not more than half a mile this singular species may be seen to the best advantage clinging to the face of crumbling yellowish sandstone or shooting up in more graceful forms its scant foliage in the shelter of the deep ravines bathed with frequent seafog One of the finest specimens seen reaches a height of nearly fifty feet and shows a trunk eighteen inches in diameter at base The chair was instructed to appoint a committee of three to be named hereafter to report and act upon such measures as may be deemed best for the preservation of the remnant of the Pinus Torreyana at Soledad treated of in the communication of Dr Parry Additions to our flora and fauna by C R Orcutt  The writer stated that since the last annual meet ing over a dozen discoveries have been made in species of plants indigenous to this section while many more have been discovered unknown hitherto in California Notes upon spiders by Rosa Smith  Zilla rosa which I discovered at San Diego less than a year ago is the connmonest orbweaver in San Francisco and vicinity spinning its delicate snare on trees bushes and fences about the city at Golden Gate Park and at the Cliff IIouse Even inside the walls of the Cal ifornia academy of sciences I have seen its lovely web accompanied by silken cocoons of its eggs This spider is easily known by the free radius in the snare  a good wedge cut out of the pie Dr McCook expresses it  which is peculiar to the genus Zilla At Aptos near Santa Cruz I secured an Epeira and cocoon of eggs and young spiders which have revealed some curious facts in regard to insect para sites Of these Dr McCook writes  One interest ing thing about the Epeira atrata cocoon is that it is strangely infested by parasitic and other enemies no less than four There were first a number of small reddish ants alive probably a species of Solenopsis who no doubt were feeding upon the eggs and debris second several larvae of Dermestidae probably At tagenus pellio These were creeping into the silky interior at will though some of them were ensconced within the empty cells of some ichneumon Next I found alive a very small ichneumon fly I have never yet seen quite such a happy family within the bounds of a spiders eggnest The spiderlings seemed to be contented and indifferent to the pres ence of these intruders A few days later Dr Mc Cook sent more information as follows Since writing you I find from Mr Cresson that the larger ichneumon is a Pezomrachus and the small one as I conjectured a chalcid of some sort which is parasitic upon Pezomachus As Pezomachus is parasitic upon spiders eggs their presence within the cocoon is thus accounted for By the way there is a yet minuter chalcid that is parasitic upon the chalcid that is par asitic upon the Pezomachus that is parasitic upon the eggs of Epeira atrata and other spiders Natural science association of Staten Island Dec 8 Mr Hollick gave an account of the recent discoveries of fossil leaves at Tottenville There are three distinct kinds of rock containing these fossils  a hard red or gray ferruginous sand stone a soft gray sandstone and a peculiar con glomerate composed almost wholly of vegetable remains cemented together with what is apparently limonite or sesquioxide of iron In the soft gray 24SCIENCE sandstone the remains are not yet destroyed but are in the form of carbon or lignite In the other rocks the vegetable tissue has almost entirely disap peared and only the impressions remain The rocks are found in blocks or fragments none of them greater than a foot square scattered along the beach mostly at the base of the bluff which is composed of drift From our present knowledge it is not pos sible to decide whether they were torn up from an outcrop below highwater mark and cast upon the beach or washed out from the base of the bluff they no doubt belong to the cretaceous although our present proofs are not yet sufficient to state this to a certainty A note was read from Dr Britton of Columbia college in which he stated that the occurrence of similar fossiliferous sandstones on the beach near Glen Cove Long Island and vicinity had been known for some time There they are found in precisely the same position as at Tottenville and are associated with extensive beds of fireclay kaoline etc The Tottenville station is not immediately on these clays but they are found near by in several directions notably at Kreischerville That the two localities mark outcrops of the same geological formation and probably approximately of the same strata is almost certain The physical structure of the Glen Cove series is exactly parallel to that of certain of the clay beds of Middlesex county NJ which are well which are found upon Betula alba the white birch which will be given later in Psyche Mr G Dimmock showed the two halves of a split wing of Attacus cecropia in which the two layers of the wing had been separated by the following mode The wing from a specimen that had never been dried is put first into seventy per cent alcohol then into absolute alcohol and from the latter after a few days immersion into turpentine After renmaining a day or two in turpentine the specimen is plunged sud denly into hot water when the conversion of the tur pentine into vapor between the two layers of the wings so far separates these layers thtt they can be easily parted and mouLnted in the usual way as miscroscopi cal preparations on a slide This is an easy way of demonstrating the saclike nature of the wings of insects Dr II A Hagen showed preparations to illustrate organs of undetermined function found on the larvae of Gomphidae Libellulidae and Aeschnidae but not as yet found on Agrionidae which he believes to be traces of segmentai organs The organs in ques tion are little cavities or invaginations of the epider mis between the segments one on each side of the median ventral line on one two or three abdominal segments according to the family to which the larva belongs Ottawa microscopical society known to belong to the cretaceous epoch In the Dec 18Mr Henry M Ami read a paper on the absence of sufficient fossil evidence we cannot state use of the microscope in determining fossils with with absolute certainty that the two deposits are especial reference to the

researches in a more be indistinguishable but for the labels with the ex scientific manner had recourse to thin sections of ception of the leafy conglomerate before described these Monticuliporidae or

be detected JANUARY 4 1884SCIEj There was still a rich and wide field open for inves tigation in the study of the Monticuliporidae and care should be taken first to ascertain with the new and more scientific means the true relations and affinities of the species described previous to 1881 Mr Whiteaves exhibited a choice series of recent Polyzoa for comparison with the fossils described in the paper Ottawa fieldnaturalists club Dec 20  Mr James Fletcher read a paper entitled Notes on the Flora ottawaensis with special refer ence to the introduced plants which was explana tory of the lists of plants hitherto published by the club and in which the nonindigenous species are not indicated Mr Fletcher first defined the district from which the plants had been collected and which lies within a circle of twelve miles radius He then noted certain of the more interesting of rare or intro duced species and presented lists tabulating the lat ter plants under the headings of  Aggressive species Species able to perpetuate themselves indefinitely Species dying out after short periods etc An animated discussion ensued confined principally to the conditions affecting introduced plants and the spreading of certain species Philosophical society of Washington Mathematical section Dec 19 Mr MI H Doolittle gave a paper on the rejection of doubtful observations in which observ NCE VOL III No 48 ingerrors were sharply divided into two classes those resulting from blunders in recording pointing on wrong objects neglect of essential precautions in instrumental adjustment etc and those resulting from an unusual accumulation of similar elements of error The latter class because by their magnitude in one direction they indicate that the remaining ob servations are in error in the opposite direction he proposed to call instructive errors and claimed that the larger they were the more instructive and the greater the necessity of retaining them In practice however the best rule with suspected observations is to reject them when they exceed the limit of error pos sible to the instructive class and when they fall within it to assign a weight proportional to the chance that the error belongs to the latter class and not the former As the law of distribution of the former class of errors if any such law exist is very different from the recognized law of the latter class these questions cannot be decided by computation with a criterion but must be left to the judgment Prof A Hall gave as a general result of the debate of this vexed question by Peirce Airy De Morgan Stone Glaisher Chauvenet Gould Winlock and others that every one can devise a criterion that suits himself but it will not please other people He strong ly opposed using such machinery in the discussion of observations as eliminated the knowledge and judgment of the investigator and giving to results a fictitious accuracy by any sweeping rejection of dis cordant data INTELLIGENCE FROM AMERICAN SCIENTIFIC STATIONS GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS Geological survey Topographical fieldwork  Mr H M Wilson in charge of one of the topographical parties in Prof A H Thompsons Wingate division surveyed dur ing the season of 1883 about ten thousand square miles in northwestern New Mexico and northeastern Arizona The area covered by his work lies between parallels of latitude 36 and 37 and extends from meridian 109 to 111 He also worked some smaller detached areas outside of the limits thus indicated This region has hitherto remained a terra incognita partly on account of its aridity and barren condition and partly on account of the difficulty of traversilng it So little has been known of it that within the area surveyed by Mr Wilson a small mountain range has been indicated as occupying two places on the same map On the engineers map of 1879 it is called Calabesa Mountains in the northern place and Squash Mountains in the southern and on the landoffice map for 1882 both are indicated without names Mr Wilsons work proves that they are one and the same occupying a position very close to that assigned to the Squash Mountains On the 11th of September Mr Wilson and one of his men made the ascent of Navajo Mountain called by the Indians Natsisad and they are probably the first white Inen who have ever stood upon its sulmmit Navajo Mountain lies on or near the line between Utah and Arizona and is a domeshaped mass rising about four thousand feet above the gen eral level of the surrounding country and sixtyfive hundred feet above the beds of the San Juan and Colorado rivers which are close to its base the for mer on the north and the latter on the west Its ele vation above sealevel is ten thousand four hundred feet It slopes abruptly especially on the east to a plateau of six to seven thousand feet which extends southeastward for fifteen or twenty miles to the canon where Mr Wilson left his packtrain in camp This was on a trail that leads to Fort Defiance vid the nortli side of the Mesa de la Vaca and the valley of the Rio de Chelly Another trail leads south ward to Moeukapi a Mormon settlement and to Oraybe and the other Moqui villages From a point a few miles south of the Navajo Mountain a third trail leads westward to Lees Ferry on the Colorado River Mr Wilson thinks there is also a trail leading to the mountain from the northwest He says all the trails in this section are exceedingly rough and difficult to travel on account of the numerous canions of five hundred to a thousand feet in depth which are cut into tle red sandstones triassic that form the

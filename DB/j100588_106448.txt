J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,106448,EXPERIMENTS WITH CHINESE HEMP SEED IN A LETTER FROM KEANE FITZGERALD ESQ TO SIR JOSEPH BANKS BART F R S,I206937,46 V EXPERIMENTS WITH CHINESE HEMP SEED IN A LETTER FROM KEANE FITZGERALD ESQ TO SIR JOSEPH BANKS BART F R S READ JANUARY 17 1782 S I R E V E R Y THING EXTRAORDINARY IN ART OR NATURE FALLS IN SOME MEASURE WITHIN THE VIEWS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY BUT HOW FAR THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNT OF WHAT APPEARED TO ME AN EX TRAORDINARY PRODUCTION MAY BE WORTHY OF BEING COMMUNICATED TO THAT LEARNED BODY IS SUBMITTED ENTIRELY TO YOUR CONSIDERATION A FEW GRAINS OF CHINESE HEMPSEED HAD BEEN GIVEN TO ME BY THE LATE MR ELLIOT BROTHER TO GENERAL ELLIOT WHO HAD FORMERLY RESIDED FOR SOME TIME IN CHINA HE TOLD ME THE HEMP IN THAT COUNTRY WAS DEEMED SUPERIOR TO THAT OF ANY OTHER BOTH FOR FINENESS AND STRENGTH AND WISHED I WOULD TRY WHE THER IT WOULD COME TO MATURITY IN THIS KINGDOM HE GAVE ME BETWEEN THIRTY AND FORTY GRAINS OF SEED FOR THE PURPOSE WHICH I LAID BY AS I THOUGHT CAREFULLY WITH INTENT OF SOWING THEM THE SPRING FOLLOWING WHICH IS THE USUAL TIME OF SOWING HEMP IN THIS COUNTRY BUT I HAD UNLUCKILY FORGOTTEN WHERE I LAID THEM AND DID NOT FIND THEM TILL THE BEGINNING OF LAST JUNE BY WHICH TIME I IMAGINED THEM TO BE VERY UNFIT FOR VEGETATION BUT AS I CONCLUDED THEY WOULD BE STILL MORE SO BY KEEPING THEM TILL THE SUCCEEDING APRIL I HAD THEM SOWED THE 4TH DAY OF THAT MONTH AND WAS MUCH SURPRISED TO FIND THAT THIRTYTWO OF POLAND STREET DEC 17 1782MR FITZGERALDS EXPERIMENTS C 47 OF THE SEEDS HAD VEGETATED STRONGLY AND GROWN TO AN AMAZING SIZE SEVERAL OF THE PLANTS MEASURING IN HEIGHT MORE THAN FOUR TEEN FEET AND SEVEN INCHES NEARLY IN CIRCUMFERENCE BY THE MID DLE OF OCTOBER FOLLOWING AT WHICH TIME THEY CAME INTO BLOOM THERE WERE FROM THIRTY TO FORTY LATERAL BRANCHES ON A PLANT THESE WERE SET OFF IN PAIRS ONE ON EACH SIDE OF THE STEM POINT ING HORIZONTALLY THE OTHERS AT ABOUT FIVE OR SIX INCHES DISTANCE FROM THEM POINTING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AND SO ON TO THE TOP THE BOTTOM BRANCHES OF SOME MEASURING MORE THAN FIVE FEET THE OTHERS DECREASING GRADUALLY IN LENGTH TOWARDS THE TOP SO AS TO FORM A BEAUTIFUL CONE WHEN IN FLOWER WHICH WERE UNLUCKILY NIPPED BY A FEW NIGHTS FROST THAT HAPPENED TO BE PRETTY SHARP TOWARDS THE END OF THE MONTH AND THE PLANTS BEGAN TO DROOP AT THE BEGINNING OF NOVEMBER AT WHICH TIME I HAD THEM PULLED UP BY THE ROOTS AS I WAS BUT LITTLE ACQUAINTED EITHER WITH THE CULTIVATION OF THE SEED OR PREPARING THE PLANTS AFTERWARDS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF HEMP AND AS THESE PLANTS WERE VERY DIFFERENT IN THEIR SIZE FROM ANY I HAD EVER SEEN THE BEST METHOD THAT OCCURRED TO ME WAS THAT OF STEEPING THEM IN WATER WHERE I LET THEM REMAIN FOR A FORTNIGHT AND THEN PLACED THEM IN AN UPRIGHT POSITION AGAINST A SOUTH WALL TO DRY AND BLEACH ON TRYING WHETHER THE HEMP COULD BE EASILY SEPARATED FROM THE WOODY PART I WAS AGREEABLY SURPRISED TO FIND THAT ON PEELING A FEW INCHES LONGITUDINALLY FROM THE ROOT THE WHOLE RIND FROM THE BOTTOM TO THE TOP NOT ONLY OF THE STEM BUT ALSO OF ALL THE LATERAL BRANCHES STRIPPED OFF CLEANLY WITHOUT BREAKING ANY ONE OF THEM THE TOUGHNESS OF THE HEMP SEEMED TO BE EXTRAORDINARY AND UPON DRYING AND BEATING DIVIDES INTO AN INFINITY OF TOUGH FIBRES THE PLANTS WHEN STRIPPED ARE QUITE WHITE AND WHEN THE LATERAL BRANCHES ARE CUT OFF APPEAR 5 LIKE48 MR FITZGERALDS EXPERIMENTS LIKE HANDSOME YOUNG POLES THEY ARE PERFORATED IN THE MID DLE BUT THE PERFORATION IS NOT LARGER THAN THAT OF A GOOSE QUILL IN A STEM OF MORE THAN TWO INCHES DIAMETER THE WOODY PART SEEMS PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL AND IF THEY SHOULD BE FOUND OF ANY DURATION MIGHT BE APPLIED TO MANY USEFUL PURPOSES OR IF NOT I SHOULD IMAGINE THEY WOULD PRODUCE PLENTY OF GOOD ASHES BY BURNING THE ROUGH HEMP THAT HAS BEEN PEALED FROM THE THIRTYTWO PLANTS WHEN THOROUGHLY DRIED WEIGHED THREE POUNDS AND A QUARTER BUT I DO NOT THINK IT HAD COME TO FULL MATURITY THOUGH I CAN HARDLY DOUBT BUT THE PLANTS WOULD HAVE COME TO PERFECTION IF THE SEED HAD BEEN SOWN IN THE PROPER SEASON THE SUMMER WAS REMARKABLY DRY NOTWITHSTANDING WHICH ALTHOUGH THE SITUATION THEY WERE PLACED IN WAS VERY WARM AND THE GROUND NOT RICH I FOUND ON MEASURING THE PLANTS AT DIF FERENT TIMES THAT THEY HAD GROWN NEARLY ELEVEN INCHES PER WEEK AS THE CULTURE OF SO VALUABLE A KIND OF HEMP AS THIS PRO MISES TO PRODUCE APPEARS TO BE OF CONSEQUENCE TO A MARITIME AND COMMERCIAL KINGDOM I HAVE APPLIED TO THE DIRECTORS OF THE EAST INDIA COMPANY TO GIVE PROPER ORDERS TO THEIR FACTORS AND SUPERCARGOES IN CHINA TO PROCURE SOME OF THE BEST SEED THAT CAN BE OBTAINED AND SEND EVEN A SMALL PARCEL BY EACH OF THEIR RETURNING SHIPS WHICH THEY HAVE VERY OBLIGINGLY PRO MISED AND FROM WHAT HAS ALREADY APPEARED THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT OF ITS CONTINUING IN A STATE FIT FOR VEGETATION FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME THAN IS USUALLY REQUIRED FOR THAT VOYAGE IF THE SEED SHOULD ARRIVE IN SAFETY I CAN HARDLY DOUBT OF OB TAINING THE ASSISTANCE OF THE SOCIETY ESTABLISHED FOR THE ENCOU RAGEMENT OF ARTS MANUFACTURES AND COMMERCE AND SHOULD EXPECT FROM THEIR WONTED ASSIDUITY AND LIBERAL DISPOSITION OF PROPERWITH CHINESE HEMP SEED 49 PROPER REWARDS FOR THE CULTURE AND MANUFACTURE OF SO VALUABLE A COMMODITY TO SEE IT AS SUCCESSFULLY CARRIED TO PERFECTION AS SEVERAL OTHER BRANCHES HAVE HAPPILY ATTAINED BY THEIR CARE AND PROTECTION AND SHALL THINK MYSELF VERY HAPPY IN BEING ANY WAYS INSTRUMENTAL IN FORWARDING SO GOOD A PURPOSE AS YOU DID ME THE FAVOUR OF EXAMINING THE PLANTS IN A GROW ING STATE I NEED NOT TROUBLE YOU WITH ANY SPECIMENS FROM THEM BUT IF THEY SHOULD BE DEEMED WORTHY OF BEING LAID BEFORE THE SOCIETY I SHALL SEND SOME OF THE HEMP IN THE STATE IT WAS PEELED AND A PIECE OF THE STEM IT WAS PEELED FROM AS ALSO SPECIMENS OF THE LEAF AND FLOWER FOR THEIR EXAMINATION I AM C V O L LXXII H

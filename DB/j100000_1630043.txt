OF THX BRITISX ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE THE INFLIJENCE OF BRAINPOWER ON HIS TORY MY first duty tonight is a sad one I have to refer to a great loss which this Na tion and this Association have sustained By the death of the great Englishman and great statesman who has just passed away we members of the British Association are deprived of one of the most illustrious of our confreres We have to mourn the loss of an enthusiastic student of science who conferred honor on our body by becoming its President We recognize that as Prime Minister he was mindful of the interests of seience and that to him we owe a more gen eral recognition on the part of the State of the value to the nation o the work of sci entific men On all these grounds you will join in the expression o respectful sym pathy with IJord Salisburys family in their great personal loss which your council has embodied this morning in a resolution of condolence Last year when this friend of science ceased to be Prime Minister he was suc ceeded by another statesman who also has given many proofs of his devotion to philo sophical studies and has shown in many utterances that he has a elear understand ing of the real place of science in modern civilization We then have good grounds386 SCIENCE N S VOLXVIII N0 456 for hoping that the improvement in the position of science in this eountry mrhieh we owe to the one will also be the eare of his sueeessor who has honored the Asso eiation by aeeepting the unanimous nomi nation of your eouneil to be your President next year an ateeptanee whith adds a new lustre to this ehair On this we may tongratulate ourselves all the more betause I think although it is not generally reeognized that the eentury into whieh we have now well entered may be more momentous than any whieh has preeeded it and that the present history of the world is being so largely moulded by the influenee of brain power whieh in these modern days has to do with natural as well as human forees and laws that statesmen and politi eians will have in the future to pay more regard to edueation and seienee as empire builders and empireguarders than they have paid in the past The nineteenth tentury will ever be known as the one in whieh the influenees of stienee were first fully realized in eivilized eommunities the seientifie progress was so gigantie that it seems rash to prediet that any of its sueeessors ean be more important in the life of any nation Disraeli in 1873 referring to the prog ress up to that year spoke as follows IIow mueh has happened in these fifty years a period more remarkable than any I will venture to say in the annals of man kind I am not thinking of the rise and fall of Empires the ehange of dynasties the establishment of GLovernments I aln thinking of those revolutions of stienee whieh have had muth more effeet than any politieal eauses whith have thanged the position and prospeets of mankind more than all the eonquests and a11 the todes and all the legislaters that ever lived  The progress of seience indeed brings in many tonsiderations whith are luomentous in relation to the life of any limited com munity any one nation One of these eonsiderations to whith attention is now being greatly drawn is that a relative de eline in national wealth derived from in dustries must follow relative negleet of seientifie edueation It was the late Prinee Consort who first emphasized this when he eame here fresh from the University of Bonn Henee the  Prinee Consort s Committee  whith led to the foundation of the College of Chemis try and afterwards of the Stienee and Art Department ilfrom that time to this the warnings of our men of stienee have betome louder and more urgent in eaeh sueeeeding year But this is not all the tommereial output of one eountry in one tentury as eompared with another is not alone in ques tion the aequirement of the seienffie spirit and a knowledge and utilization of the forees of Nature are very mueh further reaehing in their effeets on the progress and deeline of nations than is generally imag ined Britain in the middle of the last een tury was eertainly the eountry whieh gained mostby the advent of seienee for she was then in full possession of those ma terial gifts of Nature toal and iron the eombined winning and utilization o whieh in the produetion of maehinery and in other ways soon made her the riehest eountry in the world the seat and throne of inven tion and manufaeturen as Mr Carnegie has ealled her Being the great produeers and exporters of all kinds of manufaetured goods we beeame eventually with our iron ships the great earriers and henee the su premaey of our mereantile marine and our present eommand of the sea The most fundamental thange wrought by the early applieations of seienee was ir  Xature S5ovenlbel 27 1873 Vol IN p z1SCIENCE 387 SEPTEMBER 25 1903J 1847 and 1849 gives them no pause for them new inventions railways and steam ships are negligible quantities the vast in erease in the worlds wealth in free trade and proteeted tountries alike eomes merely aeeording to them in response to some poltt tcal shibboleth We now know from what has oeeurred in other States that if our Ministers had been      more wlse ancl our unlversltles more numer ous and effieient ouru nzental resources would have been developed by improve ments in edutational method by the intro duetion of stienee into sehools and more important than all the rest by the teaehing of seienee by experiment observation and researeh and not from books It is betause this was not done that we have fallen be hind other nations in properly applying seienee to industry so that our appliea tions of stienee to industry are relatively less important than they were But this is by no means all we have laeked the strengthening of the national life produeed by fostering the seientifie spirit among all elasses and along all lines of the nations aetivity many of the responsible authorities know little and eare less about stienee we have not learned that it is the duty of a State to organize its forees as earefully for peate as for war that universities and other teaehing tentres are as important as battleships or big battalions are ln fact essential parts of a modern State s maehin ery and as suth to be equally aided and as eflitiently organized to seture its future well being  Now the objeets of the British Assotia tion as laid down by its founders seventy two years ago are To give a stronger im pulse and a more systematie direetion to seientifie inquiryto promote the inter tourse of those who eultivate seleenee in dif ferent parts of the British Empire with one another and with foreign philosophers to obtain a more general attention to the ob relahtion to produeing and earrying power With the winning of mineral wealth and the produetion of maehinery in other eoun tries and eheap and rapid transit between nations our superiority as depending upon first use of vast material resourees was re dueed Seienee whieh is above all things cosmopolitan planetary not national in ternationalizes sueh resourees at onee In every market of the world  things of beauty things of use Which one fair planet can produce Brought from under every star were soon to be found Henee the first great effeet of the gen eral progress of stienee was relatively to climinish the initial supremaey of Britain due too the first use of ntatertal resourees vvhieh indeed was the real souree of our na tional wealth and plaee among the nations The unfortunate thing was that while the foundations of our superiority depend ing upon our ntaterzal resources were be ing thus sapped by a eause whtch was be yond our control our statesmen and our universities were blind leaders of the blind and our other asset our mental resourees whieh was within our eontrol Fas oulpably negleeted So little did the bulk of our statesmen know of the part stienee was playing in the modern world and of the real basis of the nation s aetivities that they imagined polit ieal and fiseal problems to be the only mat ters of importanee Nor indeed are we very muth better off today In the im portant diseussions reeently raised by Mr Chamberlain next to nothing has been said of the effeet of the progress of stienee on prites The whole eourse of the modern world is attributed to the presenee or ab senee of taxes on eertain eommodities in eertain tountries The fatt that the great fall in the prite of foodstuffs in England did not come till some thirty or forty years after the removal of the torn duty between388 SGIENCE N S VOLXVIII No 456 jeets of stienee and a removal of any disad vantages of a puble kind whieh impede its progress  In the main my predecessors in this ehair to whieh Arou have done me the honor to eall me have dealt and with great bene fit to seienee with the objeets first named But at a eritieal time like the present I find it imperative to depart from the eourse so generally followed by my pre detessors and to deal with the last objeet namedn for unless by some means or other we obtain a more general attention to the objeets of seience and a removal of any dis advantages of a publie kind whieh impede its progress we shall suffer in eompetition with other eommunities in whieh seienee is more generally utilized for the purposes of the national life THE STRUGGIE FOR EXISTENCE IN MODERN COICICUNITIES Some years ago in diseussing the rela tions of seientie instruetion to our indus tries Huxley pointed out that we were in presenee of a new struggle for exist enee  a struggle whieh onee eommeneed must go on until only the fittest survives It is a struggle between organized speeies nations not between individuals or any class of individuals It is moreover a struggle in whieh seienee and brains take the plaee of swords and sinews on which depended the result of those eonfliets whieh up to the present have determined the his tory and fate of nations The sehool the university the laboratory and the work shop are the battlefields of this new war fare But it is evident that if this or any thing lile it be true our industries ean not be involved alone the seientifie spirit brainpower must not be limited to the workshop if other nations utilize it in all branehes of their administration and exec utive It is a question of an important ehange of front It is a question of finding a new basis of stability or the Empire in faee of new eonditions I am tertain that those familiar with the present states of things will aeknowledge that the Prinee of Waless eall sVVake up applies quite as mueh to the members of the Government as it does to the leaders of industry What is wanted is a tomplete organiza tion of the resourees of the nation so as to enable it best to faee all the new problems whieh the progress of seienee eombined with the ebb and flow of population and other faetors in international eompetition are ever bringing before us Every Min ister every publie department is involved and this being so it is the duty of the whole nation King Lords and Commonsto do what is neeessary to plaee our seientifie in stitutions on a proper footing in order to enable us to faee the musie whatever the future may bring The idea that seience is usefulonly to our industries eomes from want of thought If anyone is under the impression that Britain is only suSering at present from the want of the seientifie spirit among our industrial elasses and that those employed in the State serviee possess adequate brainpower and grip of the eon ditions of the modern world into which sci enee so largely enters let him read the re port of the Royal Commission on the War in South Afriea There he will see how the whole Csystem employed was in Sir Henry Braekenturys words applied to a part of it unsqlited to the requtrernents of an Army whtch ts matrbtatned to enable us to make war Ijet him read also in the address of the president of the Soeiety of Chemieal Industry what drastie steps had to be taken by Chambers of Commeree and a quarter of a million of working men to get the Patent Ilaw Amendment Aet into proper shape in spite of all the advisers and ofElcials of the Board of Trade VerySCIENCE 389 SEP17EMBEP 25 1903 few people realize the immense number of scientific problems the solution of whichX is required for the State service The na 7 tion itself is a gigantic workshop and the more our rulers and legislators administra tors and executive officers possess the sci entific spirit the more the rule of thumb is replaced in the State service by scientific methods the more able shall we be thus armed at all points to compete successfully with other countries along all lines of na tional as well as of commercial activity It is obvious that the power of a nation for war in men and arms and ships is one thing its power in the peace struggles to which I have referred is another in the lat ter the source and standard of national effi ciency are entirely changed To meet war conditions there must be equality or su periority in battleships and army corps To meet the new peace conditions there must be equality or superiority in univer sities scientific organization and every thing which conduces to greater brain power OUR INDUSTRIES ARE SUPPERING IN THE PRESENT INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION The present condition of the nation so far as its industries are concerned is as well known not only to the Prime Minis ter but to other political leaders in and out of the Cabinet as it is to you and to me Ilet me refer to two speeches deliv ered by Ilord Rosebery and Mr Chamber lain on two successive days in January 1901 Ijord Rosebery spoke as follows     The war I regardwith apprehen sion is the war of trade which is unmista kably upon us    When I look round me I cannot blind my eyes to the fact that so far we can predict anything of the twentieth aentury on which we have now entered it is that it will be one of acut est international conflict in point of trade We were the first nation of the modern world to discover that trade was an absolute necessity For that we were nicknamed a nation of shopkeepers but now every nation wishes to be a nation of shopkeepers too and I am bound to say that when we look at the character of some of these nations and when we look at the intelligence of their preparations we may well feel that it behooves us not to fear but to gird up our loins in preparation for what is before us Mr Chamberlains views were stated in the following words I do not think it is necessary for me to say anything as to the urgency and ne cessityof scientific training    It is not too much to say that the existence of this country as the great commercial nation depends upon it    It depends very much upon what we are doing now at the beginning of the twentieth century whether at its end we shall continue to maintain our supremacy or even equality with our great commercial and manufac turing rivals All this refers to our industries NVe are not suffering beeause trade no longer follows the flag as in the old days but be cause trade follows the brains and our manufacturers are too apt to be careless in securing them In one chemical estab lishment in Germany 400 doctors of scienee the best the universities there can turn out have been employed at different times in late years In the United States the most successful students in the higher teaching centers are snapped up the mo ment they have finished their course of training and put into charge of large con cernsso that the idea has got abroad that youth is the password of success in Amer ican industry It has been forgotten that the latest product of the highest scientific education must necessarily be young and that it is the training and not the age390 SCIENCE N S Vot XVIII No 456 whieh determines his employment In Britain on the other hand apprentices who ean pay high premiums are too often pre ferred to those who are well edueated and the old ruleofthumb proeesses are pre ferred to new developments a eonserva tism too often depending upon the masters own want of knowledge I should not be doing my duty if I did not point out that the defeat of our indus tries one after another eoneerning whieh both Ijord Rosebery and Mr Chamberlain express their anxiety is by no means the only thing we have to eonsider The mat ter is not one whieh eoneerns our industrial classes only for knowledge must be pur sued for its own sake and sinee thexfull life of a nation with a eonstantly inereas ing eomplexity not only of industrial but of high national aims depends upon the universal presenee of the seientifie spirit in other words brain power our whole na tional life is involved THE NECESSITY FOR A BODY DEALING WITH THE ORGANIZATION OF SCIENCE The present awakening in relation to the nation s real needs is largely due to the warnings of men of seienee But Mr Balfour s terrible Manehester pieture of our present edueational eondition  shows that the warning which has been going on now for morle than fifty years has not been foreible enough but if my contention that other reorganizations besides that of our education are needed is well founded and if men of science are to act the part of good eitizens in taking their share in en deavoring to bring about a better state of things the question arises has the neglect 4t  The existing educational system of this country is chaotic is ineffectual is utterly  be hind the age makes us the laughingstock of every advanced nation in Europe and America ptits us behind not only our American cousins but the Ierman and the Frenchman and the ltalian Ttgmes October 15 1902 of their warnings so far been due to the way in which these have been given  Ijord Rosebery in the address to a Chamber of Commeree from whieh I have already qvloted expressed his opinion that such bodies do not exereise so mueh in fluenee as might be expeeted of them But if eommereial men do not useall the power their origanization provides do they not by having built up sueh an organization put us students of seienee to shame who are still the most disorganized members of the eommunity  Here in my opinion we have the real reason why the seientifie needs of the na    tion fail to eommand the attention either of the public or of suceessive governments At present appeals on this or on that be halfare the appeals of individuals seienee has no eolleetive voiee on the larger na tional questions there is no organized body whieh formulates her demands During many years it has been part of my duty to eonsider sueh matters and I have been driven to the eonelusion that our great erying need is to bring about an or ganization of men of seienee and all inter evsted in seience similar to those whieh pXrove so effeetive in other branehes of hu man aetivity For the last few years I have dreamt of a Chamber Guild Ileague eallit what you will with a wide and large membership whith should give us what in my opinion is so urgently needed Quite recently I sketched out such an organiza tion but what was my astonishment to find that I had been forestalledand by the founders of the British Association  TIIE BRITISH ASSOCIATION SUCH A BQDY At the commencement of this address I pointed out that one of the objects of the Association as stated byits founders was to obtain a more general attention to the objects of science and a removal of anySCIENCE 391 SEPTEMBER 2D 1903 disadvantages of a public kind which im pede its progress  Everyone connected with the British As sociation from its beginning rnay be con gratulated upon the rnagnifieent way in which the other objects of the Association have been carried out but as one familiar with the Association for the last forty years I cannot but think that the object to which I have specially reMerred has been too much overshadowed by the work done in connection with the others A careful study of the early history of the Association leads me to the belief that the funetion I am now dwelling on was  strongly in the minds of the founders but be this as it may let me point out how ad mirably the organization is framed to en able men of science to influence public opin ion and so to bring pressure to bear upon Gkovernments whieh follow public opinion 1 Unlike all the other chief metropolitan societies its outlook is not limited to any branch or branches of science  2  We have a wide and numerousX fellowship in eluding both the leaders and the lovers of science in which all branches of science are and always have been ineluded with the ut most catholicity a condition which ren ders strong committees possible on any subject 3 An annual meeting at a time when people can pay attention to the de liberations and when the newspapers can print reports 4 The possibility of beat  ing up reeruits and establishing local eom mittees in different localitiess even in the Kings dominions beyond the seas since the place of meeting changes from year to year and is not limited to these islands We not only then have a scientifie par liament competent to deal with all matters ineluding those of national importance re lating to science but machinery for in fluencing all new councils and committees dealing with local matters the funetions of which are daily becoming more important The machinery might consist of our cor responding societies We already have affiliated to us seventy societies with a mein bership of 25000 were this number in creased so as to include every scientific so ciety in the Empire metropolitan and pro vincial we might eventually hope for a membership of half a million I am glad to know that the Council is fully alive to the importance of giving im petus to the work of the corresponding so cieties During this year a committee was appointed to deal with the question and later still after this committee had re ported a conference was held between this committee and the corresponding societies committee to consider the suggestions made some of which will be gathered from the following extract  In view of the increasing importance of science to the nation at large your commit tee desire to call the attention ofthe coun cil to the fact that in the corresponding societies the British Association has gath ered in the various centres represented by these societies practically all the scientific activity of the provinces The number of members and associates at present on the list of the corresponding societies ap proaches 25000 and no organization is in existence anywhere in the country better adaspted than the British Association for stimulating encouragingand coordinating all the work being carried on by the seventy societies at present enrolled Your committee are of opinion that further en couragement should be given to these so cieties and their individual working mem bers by every means within the power of the association and with the object of keep ing the corresponding societies in more per manent touch with the Association they suggest that an offlcial invitation on behalf o the Council be addressed to the societies through the eorresponding societies com mittee asking them to appoint standingscIsNas 392 CN S VOL XVIII NO 456 British Association subcommittees to be elected by themselves with the object of dealing with all those subjects of investi gation common to their societies and to the British Association committees and to look after the general interests of scienee and scientific education throughout the prov inces and provincial centers     Tour committee desire to lay special emphasis on the necessity for the extension of the scientific activity of the correspond ing societies and the expert knowledge of many of their members in the direction of scientific education They are of opin ion that immense benefit would accrue to the country if the corresponding societies would keep this requirement especially in view with the object of securing adequate representation for scientific education on the Education Committees now being ap pointed under the new Act The educa tional section of the Association having been but recently added the corresponding societies have as yet not had much oppor tunity for taking part in this branch of the Associawtions worli and in view o the re organization in education now going on all over the country your committee are of opinion that no more opportune time is likely to occur for the induence of scientifie organizations to make itself felt as a real factor in national education     I believe that if these suggestions or any thing like them for some better way may be ound on inquiry are aecepted great good of scienee throughout the Empire will eome Rest assured that sooner or later sueh a guild will be formed beeause it is needed It is for you to say whether it shall be or form part of the British Asso  ciation 77Ve in this Empire eertainly need to organize scienee as mueh as in Germany they find the need to organize a navy The German Navy Ijeague vvhich has branches even in our Colonies already has a member ship of 630000 and its income is nearly 200001 a year A British Science Ijeague o 500000 with a sixpenny subseription would give us 120001 a year quite enough to begin with I for one believe that the British Asso ciation would be a vast gainer by such an expansion of one of its existing functions Increased authority and prestige would fol low its increased utility The meetings would possess a new interest there would be new subjects for reports missionary work less needed than formerly would be replaced by efforts much more suited to the real wants of the time This magnificent strong and complicated organization would become a living force working throughout the year instead of practically lying idle useless and rusting for 51 weeks out of the 52 so far as its close association with its members is concerned ff If this suggestion in any way commends itself to you then when you begin your work in your sections or general committee see to it that a body is appointed to inquire how the thing can be done fRemember that the British Association will be as much weakened by the creation of a new body to do the work I have shown to have been in the minds of its founders as I believe it will be strengthened by beconzong Gom pletely effective in every one of the diree tions they indicated and for whieh eSec tiveness we their successors are indeed re sponsible rhe time is appropriate for such a reinforeement of one of the winffls of our organization for we have recently ineluded Edueation among our sections There is another matter I should like to see referred to the eommittee I have spoken of if it please you to appoint it The British Association which as I have al ready pointed out is now the chief body in the Empire which deals with the totality of science is I believe the only organizasaIEyas 393 SEPTEMBER 25 1903 tion of any consequence which is without a charter and which has not His Majesty the King as patron THE FIRST VORE OF SUCH AN ORGANIZATION I suppose it is my duty after T have sug gested the need of organization to tell you my personal opinion as to the matters where we suer most in consequence of our lack of organization at the present time Our position as a nation our success as merchants are in peril chiefly dealing with preventable causesbecause of our laek o f completely efficient universities and our neglect of research This researth has a double end A professor who is not learning can not teach properly or arouse enthusiasm in his students while a student of any thing who is unfamiliar with re search methods and without that training which research brings will not be in the best position to apply his knowlNedge in after life From neglect of research comes imperfect education and a small output of new applications and new knowledge to re invigorate our industries From imperfect education comes the unconcern touching seientific matters and lshe too frequent absence of the scientific spirit in the nation generally from the court to the parish council I propose to deal as briefly as I can with each of these points UNIVERSITIES I have shown that so ar as our industries are concerned the cause of nour failure has been run to earth it is fully recognized that it arises from the insufficiency of our universities both in numbers and efEciency so that not only our captains of industry but those employed on the nations work generally do not secure a training similar to that afforded by other nations No addi tional endowment of primary secondary or teehnieal instruction will mend matters This is not merely the olinion of men of seienee our great towns know it our Min sters know it It is  sufSeient for me to quote Mr Chamberlain  It is not everyone who can by any possibility go forward into the higher spheres of edueation but it ishfrom those who do that we have to look for the men who in the uture will earry high the flag of this eountry in eommereial seientifie and eeonomic competition with other na tions At the present moment I believe there is nothing more important than to supply the defieienees whieh separate us from those with whom we are in the elosest eompetition In Germany in Ameriea in our own eolony of Canada and in Australia thethigher edueation of the people has more support from the Government is earried further than it is here in the old eountry a3nd the result is that in every profession in every industry you find the plaees taken by men and by women who have had a university edueation And I would like to see the time in this eountry when no man should have a ehanee for any oeeupation of the better kind either in our faetories our workshops or our eountitghouses who eould not show proof that in the eollrse of his university eareer he had deserved the positiorl that was offered to him What is it that makes ad eountry 0f eourse you may say and you would be quite right  The general qualities of the people their resolution their intelligenee their pertinaeity and many other good qualities  Yes but that is not all and it is not the Kain ereative feature of a great nation The greatness of a nation is made by its greatest men It is those we want to edu eate It ivs to those who are able to go it may be from the very lowest steps in the Jadder to men who are able to devote theirSCIENCE 394 N S VOL XVIII NO 456 here and all the more beeause our indus tries are not alone in question WHY WE HAVE NOT MORE IJNIVERSITIES Chief among the causes which have brought us to the terrible condition of in feriority as compared with other nations in which we find ourselves are our careless ness in the matter of edueation and our false notions of the limitations of State flmetions in relation to the conditions o     modern clvlllzatlon Time was when the Navy was largely a matter of private and local effort Wil liaxn the Conqueror gave privileges to the Cinque Ports on the condition that they furnished fiftytwo ships when wanted In the time of iEdward III of 730 sail en gaged in the siege of Calais 705 were peo ple s ships  All this has passed away for our first line of defence we no longer depend on private and local effort Time was when not a penny was spent by the State on elementary education Again we no longer depend upon private and local efRort The navy and primary education are now recognized as properly calling upon the public for the necessary financial sup port But when we pass rom primary to university education instead of State en dowment we find State neglect we are in a region where it is nobodys business to see that anything is done We in Great Britain have thirteen uni versities eompeting with 134 State and prI vately endowed in the United States and twentytwo State endowed in Germany I leave other countries out of consideration for lack of time and I omit all reference to higher institutions for technical train ing of which Germany alone possesses nine of university rank because they are less im portant they instruct rather than edueate and our want is education The German State gives to one university more than the British Government allows to all the time to higher education that we have to loolQ to continue the position which we now occupy as at all events one of the greatest nations on the face of the earth And feeling as I do on these subjects you will not be surprised if I say that I think the time is coming when Governments will give more attention to this matter and perhaps find a little more money to forward its interests Ttnzes November 6 1902 Our conception of a university has changed Uniarersity education is no longer regarded as the lusury of the rieh whieh concerns only those who can afford to pay heavily for it The Prime Minister in a recent speech while properly pointing out that the collective effect of otlr public anci secondary schools upon British char acter can not be overrated frankly ac lQnowledged that the boys of seventeen or eighteen who have to be educated in them do not care a farthing about the world they live in except in so ar as it Goncerns the cricketfield or the footballfield or the river On this ground they are not to be taught scienee arld hence when they pro ceed to the university their curriculum is limited to subjects which were better tauvht before the modern world existed or even Galileo was born But the science which these young gentlemen neglect with the full approval of their teachers on their way through the school and the uni versity to politics the Civil Service or the eanagement of commercial concerns is now one of the great necessities of a nation and our universil7es must become as much the insurers of the future progress as battle ships are the insurers of the present power of States In other words university competition between States is now as potent as competitioll in building battleships and it is on this ground that our university con ditions beeome of the highest national con cern and therefore have to be referred toSGIENCE 395 SEPTEMBER 25 1903 universities and university Golleges in Eng land Ireland Seotland and Wales put to gether These are the

our Ministers of State know that other eivilized tountries grant effieient State aid and further that private effort has provided in Great Britain less than 10 per eent of the sum thus furnished in the United States in addition to State aid  Are they GOntent that we should go under in the great struggle of the modern world beeause the Ministers of other States are wiser and beeause the individual eitizens of another Gountry are more generous than our own If we grant that there was some exGuse for the State s negleet so long as the higher teaGhing dealt only with words and books alone had to be provided for the streets of IJondon and Paris have been used as elass rooms at a pinch it must not be for gotten that during thelast hundred years not only has knowledge been enormously increased but things have repiaGed words and fully equipped laboratories must take the plaee of books and elass rooms if uni versity training worthy of the name is to be provided There is muGh more differ enee in size and kind between an old and new university than there is between the old earavel and a modern battleship and the endowments must follow suit What are the faets relating to private en dowment in this Gountry In spite of the munifieenee displayed by a small number of individuals in some loGalities the truth must be spoken In depending in our Gounvtry upon this form of endowment we are trusting to a broken reed If we take the twelve English university tolleges the forerunners of universities unless we are to perish from laGk of knowledge we find that private effort during sixty years has found less than L0000001 that is 20000001 for buildings and 400001 a year intome This gives us an average of 1660001 for buildings and 33001w for yearly intome What is the seae of private efEort we have to Gompete with in regard to the AmeriGan universities In the United States during the last few years universities and Golleges have re eeived lnore than 400000001 from this souree alone private efRort supplied nearly 70000001 in the years 18981900 Next tonsider the amount of State aid to universities afRorded in Germany The buildings of the new University of Strass burg have already Gost nearly a million that is about as muGh as has yet been found by private effort for buildings in Manehes ter IJiverpool Birmingham Bristol New eastle and Sheffield The Government an nual endowment of the same German uni versity is more than 490001 This is what private endowment does for us in England against State endowment in Germany But the State does really Goneede the prineiple its present Gontribution to our universities and Golleges amounts to 155 6001 a year no eapital sum however is taken for buildings The State endow ment of the University of Berlin in 18912 amounted to 1687771 When then we tonsider the large endow ments of university edueation both in the United States and Germany it is obvious that State aid only ean make any valid Gompetition possible with either The more we study the faets the more statisties are gXone into the more do we find that we to a large extent 1aGk both of the sourees of endowment upon one or other or both of whiGh other nations depend We are be tween two stoolsa and the prospeet is hope less without some drastie ehanges And first among these if we intend to get out of the present slough of despond must be396 SCIENGZD LN S VOL XVIII No 456 the giving up of the idea of relying upon private effort That we lose most where the State does least is known to Mr Chamberlain for in his speeeh to whiGh I have referred on the University of Birmingham he said As the importanee of tshe aim we are pursuing betomes more and more impressed upon the zninds of the people we may find that we shal be more generously treated by the State  IJater still on the oteasion of a visit to University College Sehool Mr Chamber lain spoke as follows When we are spending as we are many milions I think it is 130000001 a year on primary edutation it tertainly seelas as if we might add a little more even a few tens of thousands to what we give to Uni versity and setondary edutation   Ttrres November 6 1902 To eompete on equal grounds with other nations we must have more universities But this is not all we want a far better endowmbnt of all the existing ones not for getting better opportunities for researeh on the part of both professors and students Another erying need is that of more pro Xessors and better pay Another is the re duetion of fees they should be redueed to the level in those eountries whith are eom peting with us to say onefifth of their present rates so as to enable more students in the setondary and teehnieal sehools to Gomplete their edueation In all these ways faeilities would be af forded for providing the highest instrue tion to a mueh greater number of students At present there are almost as many pro fessors and tnstructors in the universities and eolleges of the United States as there are day students in the universities and eol legeswof the United Kingdom Men of seienee our leaders of industry and the ehiefs of our politieal parties all agree that our present want of higher edu eation in other words properly equipped universitiesis heavily handiGapping us in the present raGe for tommereial suprematy beeause it provides a relatively inferior brainpower whiGh is leading to a relatively redueed national intome The faets show that in this eountry we ean not depend upon private effort to put matters right How about loGal effort Anyone who studies the statisties of mod ern muniGipalities will see that it is im possible for them to raise rates for the building and upkeep of universities The buildings of the most modern uni versity in Germany have Gost a million DIfor upkeep the yearly sums found ehiefly by the State for German universities of different grades taking the intomes of seven out of the twentytwo universities as examples are 130000 56000 48000 37000 1st

man standard a rate must be levied of 7d in the pound for yearly expenses independ ent of all buildings But the faets are that our towns are already at the breaking strain During the last ty years in spite of enormous inereases in rateable values the rates have gone up from about 2s to about 7s in the pound for real local pur poses But no university ean he a merely loeal institution NORMAN

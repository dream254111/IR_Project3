j100588,Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London,106720,An Account of the Mode Proposed to be Followed in Determining the Relative Situation of the Royal Observatories of Greenwich and Paris By MajorGeneral William Roy F R S and A S,i206944,188 XIX An Account of the Mode proposed to be followed in deter mining the relative Situation of the Royal Observatories of Greenwich and Paris By MajorGeneral William Roy F R S and A S Read February 22 1787 TWO years have nearly elapsed since an account of the measurement of a base on HounslowHeath was laid before the Royal Society being the first part of an operation ordered by his Majesty to be executed for the immediate pur pose of ascertaining the relative situations of the Royal Obser vatories of Greenwich and Paris but whose chief and ulti mate object has always been considered of a still more impor tant nature namely the laying the foundation of a general survey of the British Islands When the operation commenced in 1784 it was not doubted that in 1786 at latest we should have been able to have pro ceeded with the series of triangles from HounslowHeath to the neighbourhood of Dover but the contrivance and construction of an instrument new of its kind proposed to be made use of and more particularly the nicety of its division whereby it is hoped the angles may be determined to a degree of precision hitherto unexampled have required much more time than Mr 2 RAMSDENGen ROYS Account c 189 RAMSDEN himself at first imagined Without meaning to disappoint this ingenious artist was perhaps in the outset too remiss and dilatory and accidents having happened when the workmanship was already far advanced which he could not foresee or prevent the execution has thereby been greatly re tarded However since the instrument may at present be con sidered as nearly finished such parts as yet remain to be per fected being only of the smaller kind we may fairly conclude that early in the ensuing summer or as soon as the weather in this country will permit the trigonometrical operation may be begun In this state of things I have therefore judged that it might be proper to lay before the Society a short sketch of the mode which is proposed to be followed in ful H filling his Majestys commands accompanied by a very slight general map of the country only col lected from the common surveys but still suffi cient to shew nearly the disposition of the triangles that will be made use of in forming the junctions between the meridians of the two Observatories In this business it will be understood that I mean to adhere to such principles as have been univer sally received and admitted as just In every series of triangles where each angle is to be actually observed with the same instrument they should as near as the circumstances will permit be equilateral for were it possible to choose the stations in such a manner as that each angle should be exactly 60 degrees the half num ber of triangles in the series multiplied by the length of one side would as in the annexed R figure give at once the total distance not only the sides of the190 Gen ROYS Account of a the scale or ladder would be perfectly parallel but the diagonal steps marking the progress from one extremity to the other would be alternately so throughout the whole length The first side is supposed to be found by the measurement of a base H of about half its length and the last side to be verified by such another base R at the opposite extremity In any particular case where only two angles of a triangle can be actually observed these should be as near as possible each 45 degrees At any rate their sum should not differ much from 90 for the less the computed angle differs from 90 the less chance there will be of any considerable error in the inter section RomneyMarsh from its levelness as well as other advan tageous circumstances attending its situation which the bare inspection of the map will render obvious seeming to me to afford the best base of verification for the last triangle I have given the series the shortest direction from HounslowHeath to that part of Kent The right hand stations occupy in general the heights which extend across the Wealds Those on the left are placed on the great range of chalk hills which end on our side of the Channel between Folkstone and Wal merCastle and recommence on the opposite side between Cape Blancnez and Calais It will be perceived that I do not mean to make St Pauls a station in the suite because in that case Harrow and Hamp stead must likewise have been made use of all three extremely inconvenient for the reception of the great instrument Besides Greenwich Observatory being hidden from the country to the southwest by the Norwood heights and from that to the southeast by ShootersHill after having made the detour of Harrow and Hampstead and come across the smoke of the Capitalproposed trigonometrical Operation 191 Capital we should still have been obliged to make use of the two stations of Norwood and Shootershill without procuring so good an intersection of Bottlehill called in the common maps I believe erroneously Botleyhill as is obtained by means of the station at the Hundredacrehouse But although none of the stations of the series actually fall within London ne vertheless from those in its vicinity viz the Pagoda Norwood Greenwich Observatory and Shootershill we shall equally have it in our power to determine accurately the situations of Harrow Hampstead and St Pauls as well as many other chief steeples within the limits of the Capital Another principle I have endeavoured to adhere to in the disposition of the triangles is this that after having obtained sides in length from 12 to 18 miles I continue them at that length as much as the circumstances will permit for if they came to be reduced considerably below that extent the obvious advantages of a long base at the outset would be lost by the subsequent contraction towards the close of the operation The tower of Tenterden church being a very conspicuous object may be seen every where from the summit of the chalk hills as far west as the river Medway It likewise may be seen from the eastern extremity of the second base whereby the last triangle Tenterden Lid Allington Knoll is proposed to be verified This knoll is itself a very remarkable object more accessible and in other respects more proper too for the purpose of a station than Lymne church steeple which I had at one time thoughts of occupying The high ground which separates Romneymarsh from the Wealds of Kent passes immediately behind Ruckinge that is to say to the north westward of it and may therefore probably prevent the top of the chalk hills from being seen from the west end of the base 7 of192 Gen ROYS Account of a of verification but if TatterleesBarn or any other point on the range near it can be seen from Ruckinge then the sta tion on the knoll as well as that at Lymne will become equally unnecessary and the triangle of verification will be come Tenterden Lid Tatterlees It will be perceived that I propose to have a station on Fairlight Head a land of considerable height from whence there is a good view of the coast of France near Boulogne From this point and Tatterlees with the help of the Indian lights I have no doubt of obtaining a fine intersection of the signal of the Boulemberg a hill of some note behind the town of Boulogne and one of the stations made use of by the French Academicians in the execution of their triangles The advantages of obtaining a triangle of this magnitude whose sides are respectively in length about 45 36 and 25 miles are too obvious to require any comment The high chalk cliffs near Folkstone prevent Dover Castle from being seen from Lid or any where in the plain of Romneymarsh Hence it will become necessary to form two small triangles to the northward of Tatterlees in order to obtain an intersection of one of the turrets of the keep of that castle Of the center of the keep it will be perceived by the strong dotted lines that the French Academicians have pro cured from their stations at Calais Blancnez and Auding hen an acute intersection de la Grosse Tour de Douvres making in the whole an angle of 28 16 20 The points which are obviously the best for connecting our triangles with those of our neighbours are the Boulemberg Blancnez and Calais provided we could by any means obtain  Tatterlees Barn in PACKES Map of East Kent on the summit of the chalk hills 727 feet above the sea asproposed trigonometrical Operation 193 as good an intersection of teh last as we are certain of getting of the two first but the breadth of the range of chalk hills being little different on our side from what it is on theirs by confining ourselves to such a base as they will afford us we cannot any way obtain an intersected angle at Calais greater than about 29 or 30 Thinking that possibly from St Peters church in the isle of Thanet the tower of Notre Dame at Calais may be seen I have extended dotted triangles into that part of Kent because if the united heights should not be sufficient to raise the top of the tower above the curvature of the sea which is the only thing to be doubted we are always certain that the signal of Blancnez may by means of the Indian lights be easily seen since the whole range of chalk hills behind Calais are dis covered with the naked eye from the isle of Thanet when the weather is tolerably clear Having in this manner ascertained the relative situations with regard to the coast of England of three points on the coast of France forming a triangle whose sides and angles we already know from their trigonometrical operations we shall in like manner be enabled to determine the situation of the point M near Dunkirk where the meridian of the Royal Observatory of Paris intersects a line drawn from the great tower of Dunkirk to that of N D at Calais See Tab IX The distance MP on the meridian of Paris will then be had and that being added to 133417 fathoms the distance of M northward from the Royal Observatory we shall have the total terrestrial arc comprehended between the parallels of the two Observatories answering to an arc in the heavens of 2 38 26 or a difference of latitude between 51 28 40 and 48 50 14 VOL LXXVII C c In194 Gen ROY S Account of a In like manner the distance from Greenwich to P on the parallel of Greenwich will then be readily computed answer ing to the difference of longitude between the two Observa tories which as far as can be judged from the map of Kent corrected for the error in the direction of its meridian amounts to about 2 20 20 supposing always that no uncertainty remains with regard to the position of the point M But here some remarks become necessary which may probably suggest to the Academy of Sciences that a further investigation of this matter may be needful on their part By referring to the 57th page of the first part of M CAS SINIS Book La Meridienne verifiee it will be seen that Dun kirk by one series of triangles is eastward from the meridian of Paris 142653 and by another 141429 toises whereof the mean is 142041 equal to 1514 fathoms This difference of 612 fathoms or little more than half a second of longitude between the mean and extreme places of M is certainly very inconsi derable But in the 60th page where in verifying the meri dian of Paris by the comparison of the angle that Broulezele makes with the meridian of Dunkirk and the angle of con vergence of one meridian to the other a difference of 21 se conds between 10 16 13 and 10 16 34 is alledged to be almost insensible we do not think to be a conclusion so unex ceptionable This however is not the only cause of uncer tainty with regard to the just position of the point M one of more importance arises from the difference that is found by two sets of triangles in the angle of intersection of the meri dian of Paris with a line drawn through M from the tower of Dunkirk to that of Calais Thus by p 53 and 56 of the first part of M CASSINIS book Dunkirk being the station Broulezele makes an angle withproposed trigonometrical Operation 195 with the meridian of 10 18 25 towards the southwest and the angle between Broulezele and Hondscote being 78 11 42 their difference 67 53 17 is the angle that Hondscote is southeast from the meridian wherefore the complement of this last angle to 180 viz 112 6 43 is the angle that Hondscote makes with the meridian of Dunkirk produced northward By p 166 of the second part Dunkirk being the station the angle between Hondscote and MontCassel is shewn to be 51 7 15 that between MontCassel and Watten 42 6 35 and by p 167 that between Watten and Calais is 51 40 20 The sum of these three angles is 144 54 10 from which deducting 67 53 17 the angle that Hondscote is south eastward from the meridian there remain 77 0 53 for the angle of Calais southwestward from it and the complement of this angle to 180 viz 102 59 7 becomes the angle that the meridian of Dunkirk produced northward makes with a line drawn through M to Calais to which last adding the angle of convergence of one meridian to the other 1 5012 corresponding to the distance of 1514 fathoms equal to 1 2912 of a great cir cle we shall have 103 0 5712 for the angle which the meridian of Paris produced northward from M makes with the line joining Dunkirk and Calais Again by p 63 of the third part of M CASSINIS book Dunkirk being the station tbe angle that Gravelines makes with the meridian southwestward is 72 11 48 and by p 12 of the said third part the angle between Watten and N D Calais is 51 39 50 also that between Gravelines and Calais is 56 42 0 Now the difference between these two last 4 47 50 being added to 72 11 48 we shall have 76 59 38 and its complement 103 0 22 for the angles that the meridian of Dunkirk makes with the line drawn from thence through the point M to Calais to which last angle adding C c 2 the196 Gen ROYS Account of a the former convergence 1 5012 we have 103 2 1212 for the angle that the meridian of Paris produced northward from M makes with the said line but by the former set of angles it was found to be only 103 0 5712 wherefore the difference is 1 15 From M CASSINIS book it appears that Dunkirk is north from Paris 12551525 toises which make 133768 fathoms and the point M being south from the tower of Dunkirk 351 fathoms there remains for the distance of M northward from the Royal Observatory 133417 fathoms Now with this distance as radius the value of an angle of 1 15 is 4812 fathoms equal to 4 34 of longitude Thus the point M instead of being westward from Dunkirk 1514 fathoms will by the last set of angles only be removed from it 146512 fathoms wherefore the difference between the mean and extreme places of M in this way of considering it will amount to 2414 fathoms about four times as much as that resulting from the comparison stated in the 57th page In the parallel of Greenwich the extreme difference will amount to 584 fathoms or about 512 seconds of longitude not much more than onethird part of a second of time In this sort of uncertainty with regard to the precise point of intersection of the meridian of the Royal Observatory of Paris with the line joining Dunkirk and Calais the only thing that can be done on our part is to consider the mean position of M as just that is to say to suppose it to be 1514 fathoms westward from the great tower of Dunkirk and having connected it with the British triangles to shew then what angle its meridian will make with the line drawn from Dunkirk to Calais Comparisonproposed trigonometrical Operation 197 Comparison of the celestial arc of the meridian comprehended between the parallels of Greenwich and Perpignan with the corresponding portions measured and computed of the terrestrial arc of the said meridian between M and Perpignan In the consideration of this matter it is to be observed that M CASSINI has divided the celestial arc between the parallel of Dunkirk or which is the same thing between the parallel of M and Perpignan into four principal sections viz that from M to Paris from Paris to Bourges from Bourges to Rodes and from Rodes to Perpignan assigning to each section the measured portion of the corresponding terrestrial arc result ing from the triangles of the meridian By pages 110 111 112 of the first part of the book it appears from the mean observed zenith distances of four stars that the arc of the heavens between the parallels of Dunkirk and Perpignan o    contains      8 20 2 26 And from the mean of the observations of a like number of stars the parallel of Rodes is distant from that of Dunkirk  6 50 51 14 Wherefore Rodes is north from Perpignan  1 39 11 12 Bourges by the mean zenith distances of two stars is south from Dunkirk      3 56 59 55 Wherefore Bourges is north from Perpignan  4 23 2 31 And by another mean in p 112 it is   4 23 2 35 The mean of which two means gives for the distance of their parallels      4 23 2 33 Perpignan198 Gen ROYS Account of a o    Perpignan is south from the Royal Observatory at Paris by the mean zenith distances of four stars   6 8 11 52 Hence Paris is south from Dunkirk   2 11 50 34 Rodes is south from Paris by the mean zenith distances of two stars      4 28 59 45 Hence Perpignan is south from Rodes   1 39 12 7 And by a former result it was found to be   1 39 11 12 Hence the mean of the two means gives for the distance of the parallels of Rodes and Perpignan    1 39 11 28 The tower of the great church at Dunkirk is northward from what was the station of the sector 8414 toises equal to 898 fathoms which correspond to an arc in the heavens of  0 0 5 19 Wherefore the tower is north from Paris   2 11 55 53 But the point M is south from the tower 351 fathoms which answer to an arc in the heavens of    0 0 20 45 Hence the point M is northward from the Royal Observatory at Paris      2 11 35 8 Now from these data together with the latitude of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich 51 28 40 and that of Paris 48 50 14 we shall have the latitudes of the several stations between Greenwich and Perpignan with their dif ferences or the celestial arcs comprehended between them as underneath Stations

trigonometrical Operation 199 arcs as determined by the zenith distances of stars taken with a sector of six feet radius and where the observations are so nearly consistent among themselves as to leave little doubt of their accuracy but in the 290th page of M CASSINIS book so often quoted as well as in the 170th page of his Description Geographique de la France published in 1783 the latitude of Perpignan is given 42 41 55 which is 7 8 less than that deduced from the observations without any rea son that I can perceive being assigned for the reduction Perpignan the southernmost station of the meridian line extending from Dunkirk through the whole Kingdom of France is situated at no great distance from the bottom of the Pyrenean mountains where that lofty range ends at the Medi terranean sea M DE LA CAILLE was of opinion that the plummet of the sector must have been affected by the attraction which it would suffer from that cause a supposition which nevertheless has been doubted since the observations made in this country on the attraction of Schehallion for by these it appeared that the effect although sensible was but small even when the sector was placed as near as possible to the oppo site sides of the mountain It is indeed true that the Canigou the highest of the Pyrenean range being situated obliquely to the meridian and at a considerable distance from Perpignan would not probably occasion much deviation in the plummet yet on the other hand when we compare the very trifling quantity of matter in Schehallion with the immensity of the mass in the Pyrenees in the direction of the meridian I can not help being of M DE LA CAILLES opinion that the plum met of the sector would be sensibly affected that is to say it would be drawn to the southward out of its perpendicular direction and would thereby give the zenith distance of the pole200 Gen ROYS Account of a pole or any other northern star too little and consequently a latitude too great Until triangles shall have been extended beyond the Pyrenees and the sector placed on the south side of the range the quantity of this attraction by its double or countereffect cannot possibly be ascertained I will however only suppose it to have been 10 8 to be deducted from the latitude of Perpignan which will then become 42 41 52 only three seconds less than that assigned to it in M CASSINIS two books before mentioned Thus the arc between Rodes and Perpignan will be 1 39 21 36 and the total celestial arc between Greenwich and Perpignan will be 8 46 48 as may be seen by attending to the four columns towards the left hand of the annexed table of comparison With regard to the corresponding terrestrial arc under which head are arranged the eleven columns towards the right hand of the table it is to be observed that various measure ments have at different times been made in different latitudes of the lengths of the degrees of the meridian for the purpose of obtaining within certain limits at least the true figure and dimensions of the earth The most essential operations of this sort as having been executed with most care with the best instruments and at the greatest distances from each other have all been done within these last forty or fifty years namely in Peru under the equator in middle latitudes in France and Italy and in Lapland near the polar circle The attraction of mountains and unavoidable errors in the execution will ever prevent just conclusions from being drawn from the comparison of measurements made too near each other These last will always be found to differ more or less among themselves Sometimes even the results may become absurd or contradictory In cases of this sort a mean of several should no doubt be 5 takenproposed trigonometrical Operation 201 taken for a mean latitude unless there should be sufficient grounds for rejecting any from the number as differing too much from the others Hence it is that philosophers are not yet agreed in opinion with regard to the figure of the earth some contending that it has no regular figure that is to say not such as would be generated by the revolution of a curve around its axis Others have supposed it to be an ellipsoid regular if both polar sides should have the same degree of flatness but irregular if one should be flatter than the other And lastly some suppose it to be a spheroid differing from the ellipsoid but such as would be formed nevertheless by the revolution of a curve around its axis although in this case too one polar side may not be similar to but more or less oblate than the other In order therefore to put this matter in its true light and to enable every one to judge by simple inspection only which of the theories agrees best with actual measurement I have computed on ten different hypotheses and arranged in their order the lengths of the arc between Greenwich and Perpig nan as also some other chief properties of each figure which last fill up the space towards the bottom of the table This mode of collecting the results seemed to me to be the most distinct that could be followed to avoid that perplexity which must for ever occur in referring back to and comparing many numbers together computed on different systems when the whole are not placed before the eye at once The first of the eleven columns or that which comes next to the celestial arc contains the measured portions of the cor responding terrestrial arc as far as they have yet been exe cuted The blanks at top cannot be supplied until we shall VOL LXXVII D d have202 Gen ROYS Account of a have determined the length MP in the map being the space comprehended between the parallels of M and Greenwich In the second column are arranged the computed dimensions appertaining to the earth as a sphere supposing its semidiameter to be a mean between the longest and shortest of M BOUGUERS second spheroid It is from the magnitude of this sphere that I compute the degrees of a great circle for the sides of spherical triangles By adverting to the errors or differences between the measurement and computation in their respective places it will obviously appear that the earth differs very considerably from a sphere for although the arc M Perpignan of 813 only exceeds the truth by 609 fathoms yet an arc of equal length at the equator viz 833 x 3746 would give an excess of 3120 fathoms and at the polar circle 833 x 3352 would give a defect of 2792 fathoms After the sphere follow seven ellipsoids of different degrees of oblateness from the first whose semidiameters have to each other the ratio of 179047 to 178047 to the seventh where it is only that of 540 to 539 On the principles which have served as the foundation of the first and second it will be necessary to make some remarks but as to the others a few words will suffice for each With regard to the first ellipsoid supposing the earth to be homogeneous it is well known that the ratio of its semi diameters may be found by comparing with each other the lengths of the pendulums that vibrate seconds in different lati tudes which lengths are deduced from the seconds of accele ration that the pendulum so adjusted and unalterably fixed as to length at the equator would perform in 24 hours on being successively transported to different latitudes as far as the pole where the force of gravity being the greatest the acceleration would likewise be the greatest The calcu 3 lationsproposed trigonometrical Operation 203 lations for this purpose were first made soon after  Lord MUL GRAVES return from his Voyage towards the North Pole in 1773  The most northern experiments hitherto made with the pendulum are those at Spitzbergen in latitude 79 50 whereof an account has been given in the Voyage towards the North Pole in 1773 The machine made use of on that occasion belonged originally to the celebrated watchmaker Mr GRAHAM and was lent for the purpose by its present proprietor Mr CUMMING who has since obligingly permitted it to remain for several years at two different times in my possession where it now is Soon after the return from Spitzbergen I ascertained its rate of going by my observatory clock for a great while together in very different temperatures and thereby found that the variation from heat and cold namely 610ths of a second for each degree of FAHRENHEIT was consi derably more than had been allowed for it in determining the acceleration from London to Spitzbergen About this time likewise Dr HORSLEY discovered that an error had been committed by the astronomer the late Mr ISRAEL LYONS employed by the Board of Longitude on that Voyage in calculating the spherical triangle for the correction of the time between the 16th and 17th of July on account of the obliquity of the transitinstrument From Dr HORSLEYS printed letter on this subject in 1774 it appears that the difference from that cause amounted to 37 seconds in time as given by the observation with the instrument and by the watch And since there was reason to suspect that the telescope had by accident been moved one could not tell how much it was judged safest to adhere to the acceleration 7108 as given by the watch The correction for the greater contraction of the steel rod I found to be 258 to be subtracted where fore the acceleration from London to Spitzbergen became 685 and that from the equator to London being 156 the total acceleration from the equator to Spitzbergen consequently was 2245 Now supposing the length of the pen dulum at the equator to be as M BOUGUER made it just 389949 inches we shall have its length at Spitzbergen 391978 inches and thence the ratio of the semidiameters of the earth considered as an homogeneous ellipsoid will be that of 1931 to 1921 instead of 1837 to 1827 which the acceleration 727 uncorrected would have given And here it seems necessary to mention some other mistakes of computation inadvertently fallen into by the astronomer in deducing the ratios of the semidiameters of the earth as stated in the 179th page of the Voyage to the North Pole not hitherto noticed that I know of D d 2 With204 Gen ROYS Account of a 1773 I am aware that experiments with the pendulum have not yet been made with that accuracy that the delicacy of their nature With the accelerations indicated in that page as arising from different experi ments or depending on the systems of different philosophers the length of the Spitzbergen pendulum and consequently the ratios should have stood as in the annexed table with which it will be perceived they differ very considerably Sir ISAAC NEWTONS ratio is placed last as probably differing most from the truth Acceleration Length Ratio of the of the Experiments From the From Lon semi diameters

found for all the latitudes where the best or most consistent experiments had been made on its acceleration and these lengths having been successively compared with each other from Spitzbergen to the equator 119 results in the whole were produced But as this number comprehended the comparisons of those at the Cape of Good Hope and the Isle of France both in south latitude these being thrown out as well as the Porto Bello pendulum and some few others more irregular than the rest there remained at last 75 results the arithmetical mean of which gave the ratio 179047 to 178047 as mentioned in the text In case Mr CUMMINGS machine should at any time hereafter be employed in the same sort of experiments it may be proper to observe that the diameter of the brass ball is 3906 inches and its weight 63726 Troy grains The weight of its bulk of mercury is 106980 Troy grains Hence the weight of mercury is to the weight of this ball of brass in air of the heat of 62 of FAHRENHEIT as 1678752 to 1 and the weight of this brass to air is as 7673 to 1 The experiments for this purpose in which Dr GEORGE FORDYCE assisted were made in the house of Mr ALCHORNE at his Majestys Mint in the Tower on theproposed trigonometrical Operation 205 nature seems to require and which at some future period should and probably will be undertaken on a more extended plan with the very best machines that can be constructed for the purpose Many ages may elapse before measurements of any considerable portion of the surface of the earth can be made in very high southern latitudes so as to determine with any tolerable degree of exactness whether the southern semi spheroid be similar to the northern supposing both to be figures of revolution But by good experiments with the pendulum alone easily repeated in all latitudes the ratio of the semi diameter of the equator to the semiaxis on both sides may be readily obtained In the mean time I thought it might be use ful to shew the result of a comparison of the most consistent ex periments of that sort that have hitherto been made in different latitudes after having applied to those at Spitzbergen certain corrections which seemed necessary as further explained in the note Thus it appears that the arithmetical mean of 75 comparisons between Spitzbergen and the equator gives the the 8th of April and 6th of June 1776 and the beam made use of with 15 lbs weight in each scale was true to three grains The machine in its present state although better sitted for experiments than it was originally since it has a wheel added whereby it registers its own time and now goes for 12 hours without winding up is no longer the same that per formed at Spitzbergen for in the interim of the two times it has been in my possession the steel rod having by accident been broken Mr CUMMING substi tuted another as like to the former as possible with regard to size but which will in all probability be susceptible of a different expansion and contraction from the effects of heat and cold In the application of the machine I have usually loaded the top of it with about 24 lbs weight of lead in order to render the center of suspension as little liable to motion as possible yet notwithstanding this precaution a pointed plummet suspended to the top of the frame has a small degree of countervibration to that of the ball which no doubt must pro duce some effect ratio206 Gen ROYS Account of a ratio of the semidiameters formerly mentioned 179047 to 178047 On this hypothesis the arc MP should contain 27350 fathoms The error on the total arc M Perpignan amounts to 2078 fathoms M BOUGUERS degree at the equa tor being adhered to the 45th of latitude will exceed the truth 216 and that at the equator 148 fathoms The ratio of the semidiameters of the second ellipsoid which comes now to be spoken of has been obtained by the comparison of such measured lengths of the degrees of the meridian in different latitudes as have been found to be most consistent with each other Our countryman Mr NORWOOD was the first of late times who made any attempt of this sort But the measurement executed by him in the year 1633 between London and York has no pretence to exact ness since he himself tells us that when he did not measure he paced Besides his degree is as great or even greater than that in Lapland and these are surely sufficient reasons for rejecting it from the comparison The degree measured by M LIESGANIG in latitude 45 57 in that part of Poland lately fallen to the share of the Emperor and annexed to Hungary being so much shorter than degrees to the southward of it gives grounds to suspect that some error had crept into that operation or that the plummet had been affected by the attrac tion of neighbouring mountains and therefore is not made use of on the present occasion M DE LA CAILLES degree at the Cape of Good Hope being in south latitude and so much greater than those of the same height in northern latitudes is improper likewise to be brought into the comparison lest the difference may have arisen from a dissimilarity in the two polar sides of the ellipsoid The degree measured in the north of France compared with that in Austria

Now these six degrees being successively compared with each other fifteen results are thereby obtained whereof the arithmetical mean gives for the ratio of the semidiameters of the ellipsoid that of

polar circle near 88 fathoms The ratio of the semidiameters of the third ellipsoid 21606 to 21506 is obtained by adhering to the measured lengths of the degrees at the equator and polar circle According to this hypothesis the arc MP should contain 27301 fathoms The arc M Perpignan exceeds the truth 1288 and that at the 45th of latitude more than 128 fathoms The208 Gen ROYS Account of a The ratio of the semidiameters of the fourth ellipsoid 22255 to 22155 is the same as may be seen by referring to the table with that assigned by M BOUGUER to his first spheroid where the increments to the degrees of the meridian above that at the equator are as the second power or squares of the sines of the latitudes It was intended chiefly to shew how small the difference is between the magnitudes and nature of the curves of the two figures The arc MP should contain 27294 fathoms The arc M Perpignan errs in excess 1177 fathoms The 45th degree exceeds the truth 116 fathoms and that at the polar circle falls short of the measured length 21 fathoms M BOUGUERS degree at the equator being adhered to as the standard The ratio of the semidiameters of the fifth ellipsoid 230 to 229 is that assigned to the earth by Sir ISAAC NEWTON On this hypothesis the arc MP should contain 27241 fathoms The arc M Perpignan only exceeds the truth 202 fathoms because the 45th degree of the meridian is here adhered to as the standard length But then the degree at the equator falls short of the measurement 102 fathoms and that at the polar circle 14612 wherefore an arc of 813 in the first case would be defective 850 and in the last 1220 fathoms The ratio of the semidiameters of the sixth ellipsoid 310 3 to 3093 is obtained by adhering to the measured lengths of the degrees at the equator and 45th of latitude The arc MP should contain 27230 fathoms The arc M Perpignan only exceeds the truth 131 fathoms but on this hypothesis the degree at the polar circle would be defective near 217 fa thoms and consequently on 813 the error would be 1807 fathoms 7 Theproposed trigonometrical Operation 209 The seventh or last ellipsoid being that of the least flattening has for the ratio of its semidiameters 540 to 539 The arc MP should contain 27206 fathoms The 45th degree of latitude being adhered to as the standard the arc M Perpignan would only exceed the truth by 46 fathoms but on the other hand the degree at the equator erring in excess 12412 fathoms and that at the polar circle being defective near 303 therefore in the first case the error on 813 would be 1037 and in the last 2524 fathoms Hence it is obvious that the arcs of an ellip soid however great or small the degree of its oblateness may be will not any way correspond with the measured portions of the surface of the earth for if we retain the length of M BOUGUERS degree at the equator as the standard and make the ellipsoid extremely flat as in No 1 the figure will become too prominent in middle latitudes that is to say the curve will rise above the real surface of the earth and in proportion to the excess of the radius will always give degrees that exceed the measured length On the contrary if we give the ellip soid a small degree of flatness as in No 7 and adopt the mea sured length of the 45th degree as the standard the measured and computed arcs will nearly agree in middle latitudes but at the equator the curve will rise very considerably above the sur face and will thereby give degrees that are too great while at the polar circle it will fall below it and give degrees that are too little in the proportion of about 212 to 1 compared with the error at the equator From all which we may conclude that the earth is not an ellipsoid The two columns towards the righthand of the table contain the arcs of two spheroids differing from the ellipsoid The first is that adopted by M BOUGUER as his first hypo thesis where the increments to the degrees of the meridian VOL LXXVII E e above210 Gen ROYS Account of a above that at the equator follow the ratio of the second power or squares of the sines of the latitudes and to which he has suited his first table of degrees No 32 p 298 This spheroid differs but insensibly as has been already mentioned from the fourth ellipsoid They have both the same semidiameters but the arcs of the spheroid being somewhat longer than those of the ellipsoid the former thereby becomes in a trissing degree more prominent in middle latitudes On this hypo thesis the arc MP should be in length 27295 fathoms M Per pignan exceeds the measurement 1196 fathoms and the de gree at the equator being adhered to as the standard the 45th errs in excess 118 while that at the polar circle is defective only 20 fathoms The second spheroid is that whereon M BOUGUER founded his second hypothesis which supposes the increments to the degrees of the meridian above that at the equator to follow the ratio of the fourth power or squared squares of the sines of the latitudes and to which he has adapted his second table of degrees No 38 p 305 It will be perceived that the ratio of the semidiameters of this spheroid viz 1794 to 1784 differs little from that appertaining to the first ellipsoid but here the curve falling considerably within that is to say being less pro minent than the ellipsoid in middle latitudes the arcs are thereby contracted in such a manner as to agree within 5 fa thoms with the measured length of the meridian of France in an extent of about 813 comprehended between M near Dun kirk and Perpignan situated at the bottom of the Pyrenean mountains By inspection of the table it will further appear that the errors in the several sections of this arc are not only small but they are sometimes plus and sometimes minus a never failing proof that as far as our present data will enable usproposed trigonometrical Operation 211 us to judge the figure here assigned to the earth notwithstand ing what has been alledged to the  contrary is exceedingly near the truth According to this hypothesis the distance MP on the meridian of Paris which is yet to be determined by our trigono metrical operations should contain 27243 fathoms being only 35 fathoms less than what is given by the mean of the seven different ellipsoids a space not amounting quite to 2 of latitude The re sult of the measurement of this space answering to an arc in the heavens of 26 50 52 of latitude will be a further confir mation or otherwise of the justness of the theory The degree at the equator being adhered to as the standard it will be seen from the table that the 45th is defective 376 while that at the polar circle errs in excess 94 fathoms  Mr J KLOSTERMANN Inspector of the Corps of Pages at St Petersourg in his manuscript Memoir some time since transmitted to the Royal Society to the Academy of Sciences at Paris and also to that at Gottingen has endea voured to shew that the French trigonometrical operations are extremely erro neous It would seem nevertheless that he has attempted to prove too much He should certainly have confined his criticism to the triangles of the meridian only which are distinguished from the others in M CASSINIS book by being printed in larger characters without drawing conclusions from very acute angles which although inserted in the general register were not made use of in the determination in question But as the Royal Academy of Sciences will no doubt vindicate the credit of their own operations I shall only further remark on the Literary News from Gottingen Nachricht aus den Gottingischen Anzeigen von gelebrten Sachen 117 Stuck 1785 which accompanied the said Memoir and where it is said  That M BOUGUERS hypothesis of the 4th power fell to the  ground so soon as other degrees were measured than those on which he had  founded it that I confess myself to be quite of a different opinion not doubting that when the comparison is fairly drawn between this and every other system that has hitherto been submitted to the consideration of the public M BOUGUERS will be found to be justly entitled to the preference which I have here endeavoured to give it His works shew that he was a man of very superior abilities eminent as a mathematician and perhaps the best practical one that ever existed E e 2 Besides212 Gen ROYS Account of a Besides these two spheroids of M BOUGUER I had com puted the arcs of another between the two where the incre ments to the degrees of the meridian were in the ratio of the fractional power 342100 of the sines of the latitudes Thus the computed agreed accurately with the measured dimensions in three principal parts of the earths circumference namely at the equator 45 and 66 20 of latitude at the same time that the arc MP contained 27257 fathoms but the labour of com putation being hereby greatly augmented and the error on the total arc between M and Perpignan amounting to 290 fathoms in excess this system did not seem to me to deserve to be put in competition with the simplicity of that of M BOUGUER who indeed for the same reason preferred the fourth to the frac tional power 31011ths which he tells us was that which still came nearer the truth In short it must be from the results of future operations executed in very high latitudes and the measurement of degrees of longitude on the equator that we can hope to have sufficient authority for any correction or a melioration of the system of M BOUGUER Differences of longitude Hitherto there has been no particular reference to some lines at the bottom of the table containing the computed lengths of degrees of longitude on each hypothesis in three different lati tudes namely the equator 43 32 and 51 28 40 No measurements of degrees of longitude as far as I know have ever been executed with sufficient care and accuracy except that in the south of France as mentioned in the 105th and 106th pages of M CASSINIS book which was determined by theproposed trigonometrical Operation 213 the repeated explosions of gunpowder in the open air and found to contain 41618 toises equal to 443544 fathoms By attending to the table it will be seen that the error in excess of M BOUGUERS theory on the length of this degree trigono metrically measured amounts only to 19 fathoms which is little more than 110th part of a second of time In fixed Observatories where able astronomers have been for many years employed in repeating their observations of the heavenly bodies it seems surprising that any doubt should remain with regard to what is called the astronomical dif ference of longitude or in other words the difference of time between them yet it has been alledged that an uncertainty of this sort exists even with regard to the situation of Green wich and Paris which reckoned by its extremes extends to about 10 or 11 seconds answering in the latitude of Green wich to the enormous difference in space of between 1600 and 1700 fathoms But it will be considered as still more won derful if between two British Observatories Greenwich and Oxford which have been long supplied with great and costly instruments of the very best kinds there should remain an uncertainty in this respect of 2 or 3 seconds of time for in the latitude of Greenwich 3 seconds correspond to 477 and in that of Oxford to 47412 fathoms These however are points which must be left to the respective astronomers to settle in the best way they can and it is not to be doubted that the Astrono mer Royal will throw a new and very satisfactory light on the matter in the Paper which he proposes about this time to lay before the Royal Society along with M CASSINIS Memoir which for that purpose has now been nearly two years in his possession With214 Gen ROYS Account of a With regard to the trigonometrical operation which may be considered as infallible because by means of the base of verification it will prove itself and if small errors unavoidably arise in the course of a long suite of triangles the maximum of these may be always ascertained I have no doubt that the distance between Greenwich and the point P in the map may thereby be determined to a very small number of fathoms perhaps to fifteen or sixteen on a difference of longitude of about 2 20 20 and therefore to about 120th part of a second of time on each degree This for any useful purpose will certainly be admitted to be sufficiently near the truth and is probably considerably nearer than it will be brought for many years to come by a mean of the best observations of the hea venly bodies if these should be found in the present state of the matter to leave it yet doubtful to two or three seconds The astronomical difference of time may likewise be ob tained by experiments on the instantaneous explosion of light but these I would propose to be made subsequently to the trigo nometrical operations The station of Tatterlees towards the eastern extremity of our range of chalk hills or some point near it would seem to be the most proper for the place of ex plosion because it can be seen from Bottlehill on the same range and nearly in the meridian of Greenwich Observatory It is not to be doubted that Tatterlees may be seen from Fienne Windmill or even perhaps from that of the Brunemberg since they are both situations on the continuation of the same range in France the distance being shorter too and little land but chiefly sea intervening Let us then suppose that the two astronomers with their clocks and transitinstruments are posted one at Bottlehill and the other at the Brunemberg while gun powder is repeatedly exploded at Tatterlees or while the Indian lightsproposed trigonometrical Operation 215 lights are alternately exhibited and again covered by an extin guisher prepared for the purpose which operation may be repeated several times the same evening it is certain that a just mean being taken between the instants so marked by the respective clocks well regulated beforehand the difference of time between the two extreme stations will thereby be ob tained to a very considerable degree of accuracy and probably more to be relied upon than that resulting from the comparison of the observations of the heavenly bodies Rockets have been proposed by some to be applied in this way but even the largest sort carrying upon too small a body of white light could I think only be depended upon for short distances and since the actual error of observation would be the same on a short as on a long distance remote stations only should be chosen for conclusive experiments of this na ture It is imagined that by means of a balloon a set of lightballs might be sent up of such a volume as to be seen from their great elevation in the air at stations very remote from the place of explosion The balloon would ascend with a burning fuze attached to the first ball and having attained the wishedfor height it might be made fast below by means of a cord fixed to it for the purpose  The first ball on its explosion would communicate fire to the second and so in succession at intervals of time proportionable to the lengths of  It is to be understood that the practicability of fastening the balloon to the earth by means of a rope must be previously ascertained for if that should be found impossible without the wind forcing it down again to the ground then it must be sent up detached with burning fuzes fixed to it of still greater dimensions By means of these it is imagined that the track of the balloon in the air might be pointed out to the remote observers who might perhaps be better enabled thereby to watch for and distinguish the successive instants of the bursting of the white lights the216 Gen ROYS Account of a the fuzes Thus 8 or 10 instants might be marked from the experiment of a single balloon which might then be hauled down to be reloaded for a repetition But whatever might be the mode adopted as the best for conducting experiments of this nature the observers must not only be very attentive and dili gent but also quicksighted have their clocks nicely regulated indeed and the trials must be many times repeated before the uncertainty even in this way which seems to be the best mode could be reduced to less than 12 0th part of a second of time to which it may infallibly be brought by trigonometry Having in this manner shewn what probable degree of exact ness may be expected in the various but usual ways of ascer taining the difference of longitude between the Observatories of Greenwich and Paris and compared the results with the uncertainty that seems yet to exist in this matter from the state of astronomical observations let us next see how Mr RAMS DENS instrument is likely to perform when actually applied to the determination in question by the observed angle be tween the pole star in its eastern or western azimuth and a very remote station whose distance from the instrument is known by the series of triangles and distinguishable by the Indian lights at night for the purpose of this particular observation With an instrument carrying telescopes so good that the pole star may be seen in daylight it is obvious that the bi sected angle between the star in its eastern and western azi muths will give at once the polar distance of the star and the true meridian of the place as referred to any known sta tions visible at the time of observation But as cloudy wea ther may often prevent a complete observation of this sort from being obtained and since much time might be lost in 3 attemptingproposed trigonometrical Operation 217 attempting it therefore the declination of the star settled for any particular period being accurately known  its apparent distance from the pole may by the established rules be readily computed for any proposed day as well as the precise times of its greatest elongations twice in 24 hours when in its eastern and western azimuths at which times it will for several mi nutes appear as to sense stationary or without motion except in altitude These are therefore the best times for taking the angle between the star and any particular station since the observations may be repeated frequently in the space of a few minutes or until it shall be perceived that the star has again approached towards the pole Now suppose the station of the instrument to be at Tatterlees whose distance from the perpen dicular to the meridian of Greenwich and consequently from its parallel is known by the trigonometrical operation The latitude of the station becomes known likewise and let the colatitude be 38 54 20 Let us likewise suppose the distance of Bottlehill on one side to be 44100 fathoms equal to 43 286 of a great circle and that of the Brunemberg on the other to be 38250 fathoms equal to 37 426 of a great cir cle and further that on these two stations the Indian lights are exhibited for the time proposed Now let the angle be tween the meridian and Bottlehill and that between it and the Brunemberg be observed by means of the pole star corrected for its distance for the day and suppose the first to be 75 10  Since this Paper was written the Astronomer Royal has been so obliging as to furnish me with the mean distance of the pole star from the pole as settled at Greenwich by eight observations above and nine below it made in the year 1786 whereby it appears that the mean distance reduced to the beginning of that year was 1 50 835 and the mean annual precession in declination being 1955 consequently the mean distance for the 1st of January 1787 was 1 49 88 VOL LXXVII F f and218 Gen ROYS Account of a and the last 125 5 thus we shall have two spherical tri angles to compute in each of which two sides and the con tained angle are known and one side viz the colatitude is common to both Now from these data making use of the half sum and half difference of the sides we shall have the angles in these two triangles as  underneath and the angle of longitude between Bottlehill and the Brunemberg equal to that at the pole will be found to be 1 55 561 If from this angle we deduct about 30 or 35 for the space that the Bottlehill seems to be to the westward of the meridian of Greenwich there will then remain 1 55 21 for the east longitude of the Brunemberg being very nearly that expressed in the map of the triangles which accompanies this paper

meridians which are all parallel to each other at the equator on their departure from thence converge more and more as they approach towards the pole where the anlge of convergence becomes equal to the angle of longitude It may also be remarked that the angle of convergence augmented by the excess of the three angles of the spherical triangle above 180 is always equal to the angle of longitude or that at the pole And as this holds universally in all latitudes it affords a ready means of proving that the compu tations are just 3 Asproposed trigonometrical Operation 219 As far as we are enabled to judge at present from the exa mination of the divisions of Mr RAMSDENS instrument there is every reason to believe that in taking angles around the horizon the mena of several repetitions of the same angle as referred to different parts of the circumference of the circle will differ very little from the truth so little indeed that in many cases the error will totally vanish But in elevating the telescope towards the pole let us suppose that an error of 5 seconds on each of the contained angles at Tatterless has been committed and further that even an error of 5 seconds of latitude equal to about 8412 fathoms on the meridian may have been fallen into in estimating the colatitude which never can happen but is only here admitted to place the example in the most disadvantageous circumstances possible then whoever will give themselves the trouble to recompute the two triangles with these new data will find the result in longitude not to be varied thereby in the first case above 15th part of a second or 17 5th part of a second in time and in the last not quite 1 second or 11 5th part of a second in time Hence I conclude that the best mode of determining the differences of longitude will be by the instrument itself applied in this way in taking the angles between the pole star and very remote stations distinguishable at night by the help of the Indian lights and whose distance is accurately known This method will it is true be liable as well as astronomical observations to the imperfections of the instrument particularly those of the telescope and the unavoidable error in its application but on the other hand it will be entirely free from the irregula rities of clocks and the imperfections of vision in marking the instantaneous explosion of light When both methods have been repeated a sufficient number of times with all F f 2 imaginable220 Gen ROYS Account of a imaginable care we shall then and not till then be able to judge to which the preference may be due Thus five or six long stations in or nearly in the parallel of Greenwich such for instance as that of Shootershill Tower would reach from the east quite to the west of the island and as a very considerable degree of consistency might be expected among the results for equal portions of the parallel this methods seems to be as likely as any to furnish data for determining the nature of the spheroid or figure of the earth Table of the degrees of the earth constructed on the hypothesis of M BOUGUER Beside the table of comparison of the arc between Green wich and Perpignam which I have already endeavoured to explain this Paper is accompanied with another which as well as the former was originally intended solely for my own use With this view it was at first only computed for every five minutes of the 51st and 52d degrees of latitude that I might thereby be enabled more readily to compare the longitudes and latitudes of the respective stations in our progress towards the coast and more particularly to fit it for operations in the south parts of England as likely to be first carried into execution In order however to render it more generally useful it has since been extended to every five degrees in the higher and lower parts of the quadrant and to every single degree in inter mediate latitudes The table not only contains the degrees of the meridian and of longitude but also those of a great circle perpendicular to the meridian and likewise such as are oblique to it for the other seven points of the compass With regard to the construction of the table it is only necessary to make someproposed trigonometrical Operation 221 some remakrs on that column of it which contains the sum of the three equations or difference between the degree of the meridian and the corresponding degree of the great circle per pendicular to it which is the most troublesome to compute but must be found before the degree of longitude can be obtained The first part of M BOUGUERS equation consists of 71 5ths of the difference between the degree of the meridian at the equa tor and that at the pole viz 54512 fathoms to be constantly added Secondly 34ths of the increment of the corresponding degree of the meridian above that at the equator to be sub tracted and thirdly 415 of a third proportional to the excess of the degree at the pole above that at the equator as radius and the sine of the corresponding latitude to be added Now it will be found that this last part of the equation 41 5ths if uniformly applied would have produced absurd results at the 75th degree of latitude that is to say the degrees of a great circle would there have become greater than the degree at the pole The equation 41 6ths or 14th would in like man ner have produced absurd results between the 79th and 80th degree Even 29ths will not go on further than the 85th and the highest equation that will go through the whole qua drant uniformly applied must not exceed 8 03 7 0 parts of the third proportional M BOUGUER himself had found this and accordingly had applied the equation with a certain modifica tion or abatement which nevertheless he makes no mention of in his book Seeing therefore that the degrees of a great circle perpendicular to the meridian differ most from those of latitude about the tropics I have at the 20th degree applied the equation 41 5ths or 8 03 0 0 parts and made the divisor increase by unity for each degree of the quadrant above that point to the pole where it becomes 8 03 7 0 parts Below the 20th degree the222 Gen ROYS Account of a the divisor in like manner increases by unity to the equator where it becomes 8 03 2 0 parts With respect to the degrees of great circles obliquely situated to the meridian they were chiefly intended for facilitating the computations of curvature and refraction where in any particular case it might be come necessary to obtain to great precision the relative height of a very distant station with regard to that occupied by the instrument for in such cases in strictness the angle which the line makes with the meridian should be attended to The computations  for the construction of this table have been as may easily be judged sufficiently laborious but hav ing once begun I was induced to go through with them con ceiving that a table of this sort would be of general utility and that it might be very long indeed before the results of future operations yet to be undertaken in different and very remote parts of the globe would furnish data for any thing better It must be by the united efforts of englightened nations conspiring as it were together in promoting the cause of sci ence that great objects such as the determination of the magnitude and figure of the earth can ultimately be obtained Each should contribute to it and all have it more or less in their power according to their particular situation and that  Much care has been bestowed in the various computations for the con struction of the two tables appertaining to this Paper In the last which has been the most laborious the differences to go on so uniformly it is hoped no error of any consequence will be found Here it is proper that I should mention a typical erratum in one of the tables belonging to my Paper on the Barometer published in the LXVII volume of Transactions for 1777 It is in Tab VI containing observations on

surface which has fallen to their share in the general distribution of things Under the auspices and immediately under the eye of a Sovereign who loves and cherishes the sciences much may be done within the limits of the British islands which reckoning from Eastness in Suffolk to the western parts of Kerry in Ire land contain near 12 degrees of longitude and counting from the Channel on the south to the Orkney islands only on the north about 9 degrees of latitude With this general purpose in view and at the same time to lay the best foundation for the survey of the British islands I would propose as the opera tions preferably to be executed that serieses of triangles should be extended along different meridians particularly those of the chief Observatories and of some remarkable hills in the central parts of the island till they fall into the sea on the south and north and that across these a great number of serieses in the parallels likewise of the chief Observatories and of re markable hills or eminencies should be extended from the east to the west coast The Wrekinhill on the eastern skirt of Shropshire seems to be an eligible point being in a central situation sufficiently conspicuous and yet not so high as to render the frequent access to it very inconvenient If it should be found that longitudes may be determined by the instru ment to the degree of accuracy which is expected and that it may likewise be advantageously applied independently of the zenith sector in tracing any parallel whose latitude has been already ascertained or the parallel of any remarkable point whose meridian is known but not its latitude then the num ber of these parallel serieses cannot be too much multiplied for a great many of these operations executed with due care would absolutely224 Gen ROYS Account of a absolutely give the figure of the earth since the shortest distance from the surface to its axis would thereby be obtained The British dominions in the EastIndies offer a scene parti cularly favourable for the measurement of five degrees of lati tude on the coast of Choromandel as has been noticed by Mr DALRYMPLE F R S in his Paper on the Marine Survey of that Coast Two degrees of longitude at each extremity of this arc should likewise be measured The plains of Bengal directly under the northern tropic afford another situation where it would be of great consequence to determine the lengths of a degree or two of latitude and as many of longitude These two operations could not fail to be patronised by the EastIndia Company who should defray the expence since whatever tended so much to the improve ment of science in general and so directly to that of naviga tion in particular must be thought important to a Body of Merchants whose power as well as opulence stand at this day unequalled in the mercantile history of the world But these is one operation yet to be mentioned that would contribute more than any other to the determination of the figure of the earth which is the accurate measurement of some degrees of longitude on the equator because thereby the length of its semidiameter would be immediately known which hitherto has only been theoretically computed from the measured portions of the meridian The Portuguese seem to be possessed of the most advantageous situation yet known on the globe for that purpose for M DE LA CONDAMINE has told us that at the mouth of the river of Amazons near the fort of Macapa in three minutes north latitude there are 5 extensiveproposed trigonometrical Operation 225 extensive open plains where an operation of this sort would not have been so difficult as was at first imagined when he pro posed the scheme to the Academy of Sciences a year before the voyage to Quito was thought of Had this been adopted as the scene of their operations instead of that elevated valley comprehended between the lofty ranges of the Andes the business would have been much sooner accom plished with infinitely less labour and fatigue and still more satisfactorily since degrees of longitude as well as of latitude would probably have been measured Here then the Portu guese should determine the length of two or more degrees of longitude and as many of latitude by way of proof or cor rection of the Peruvian observations A well conducted ope ration of this kind could not fail to add to the celebrity of a nation who by their discovery of the new world in the west and having opened the route by the Cape of Good Hope to the eastern side of the globe may be considered as the founders of modern navigation With regard to operations in high northern latitudes which would doubtless be of great importance the Russian Empire must certainly afford a variety of situations more or less diffi cult for the purpose and an Empress who commands so great a proportion of that region of the world where it is said ex ploratory discoveries are at present carrying on by her order can scarcely be supposed to suffer a reign otherwise so bril liant to expire without directing something of this sort to be executed under the polar circle or as near to the pole as the severity of the climate will

relative Situation of the Royal Observatories of Greenwich and Paris See p 188 Read Nov 8 1787 I N the account of the proposed trigonometrical opera tion for determining the difference between the meri dians of the Royal Observatories of Greenwich and Paris I have at p 221 and 222 had occasion to remark on an inconsistency found in the sum of the three equations as stated by M BOUGUER for obtaining the lengths of de grees of great circles perpendicular to the meridian above their corresponding degrees of latitude without having been aware of the true source of the error for which I am in debted to the investigations of the Astronomer Royal who having found it out obligingly communicated the same to me about the time of the annual recess of the Society in the end of June last At p 289 and again at p 313 and 314 of M BOU GUERS Book the subtractive branch of the equation or the part of DG the gravicentric arc answering to the difference between the radii of curvature at the equator and given lati tude has erroneously been expressed in words 34ths instead of 45ths which the algebraic formula justly gives for it and ac cording to which M BOUGUERS table has been accurately computed Not suspecting any thing of this sort no intima T t t 2 tion466 tion of it appearing among the errata and no notice having been hitherto taken as far as I know of such a mistake existing in that justly celebrated work now so many years in circulation throughout the world instead therefore of 415ths or 80300 parts of the third proportional the last additive mem ber of the equation I substituted another with a certain modification however as stated in the beforementioned pages amounting only to 80370 parts of the third proportional being the highest that would apply to the whole quadrant without producing absurd results Thus I obtained approximate de grees of great circles and of longitude differing but little from those of M BOUGUER and compensating in a great measure although not altogether for the then undiscovered cause of the mistake of 120th part of the arc DG for 45  34  120 In this state of the case I have judged it incumbent on me to annex a supplementary table where the degrees of great circles and of longitude are accurately computed by the cor rected subtractive branch 45ths of DG instead of 34ths as it now stands in the original table From inspection it will appear that the maximum of correction amounts nearly to 512 fathoms at the 70th degree of latitude diminishing gradually from thence to the pole on one side and the equator on the other where it vanishes The maximum of correction for the degrees of longitude amounting to about 213 fathoms is applicable between the 58th and 59th degree of latitude where M BOUGUERS degree of the meridian becomes equal to his degree of longitude on the equator From this point it diminishes gradually to the pole on one side and the equator on the other where it in like manner disappears With regard to degrees of great circles situated obliquely to the meridian it is sufficiently obvious that they are so little affected as to render it of but small importance whether they 7 are467 are corrected or not but for such as are scrupulous to fractional parts of fathoms these may satisfy themselves with great facility and exactness by attending to and proportioning by the common tabular

observed that half of the correction is con stantly to be applied at the 45th degree of obliquity and since the differences between the terms in the progression equally removed on either side from 45 are always equal to each other it follows that the corrected differences are to be applied with the contrary sign those between 45 and the meridian being in diminution and these between 45 and the east or west points being in augmentation of the length till in the first case the degree becomes equal to that of latitude and in the last to that of a great circle perpendicular to the meridian The Table of Comparison p 227 is no where affected by the alteration which has been the subject of this discussion except in the two last lines from the bottom as adverted to among the errata subjoined to this supplement This intimation of M BOUGUERS mistake in expressing his formula in words was accompanied with the conversion of that468 that formula by Dr MASKELYNE into the following adapted to natural sines a x 11  8 x cos 2 lat  3 cos 4 lat30 a is the excess of the radius of curvature at the pole above that at the equa tor and the sign of either term is only to be changed when the doubled or quadrupled latitude become greater than 90 and less than 270 I embrace this opportunity of mentioning another circum stance wholly unknown to me at the time my Paper was com posed From what has been there said at p 216 and so on to p 220 it will probably be inferred that I considered the proposed mode of determining the differences of longitude by the observa tions of the pole star made with a very accurate instrument rather as new not knowing that the same idea or one nearly the same had before occurred to the Rev Mr MICHELL and been treated on by him in his very ingenious Paper in the Philoso phical Transactions Vol LVI for the year 1766 That I must have read that valuable performance about the time of its publication is not to be doubted but in the lapse of so many years every trace of it had gone from my remembrance otherwise I would have most certainly referred to it in the proper place and with the attention that it so well deserves However without entering here into particulars it will obviously appear that the one has not been borrowed from the other E R R A T A In p 195 l 27 for between Gravelines and Calais read between Watten and Gravelines And in l 28 for 56

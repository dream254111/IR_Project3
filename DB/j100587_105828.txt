INTERVENTION OF FIXED AIR,I206924,216 RECEIVED JUNE 8 1769 XXX A LETTER FROM MR LANE APOTHE CARY IN ALDERSGATESTREET TO THE HO NOURABLE HENRY CAVENDISH F R S ON THE SOLUBILITY OF IRON IN SIMPLE WATER BY THE INTERVENTION OF FIXED AIR ALDERSGATESTREET JUNE 5 1769 SIR THE VARIOUS IMPREGNATIONS OF MI NERAL WATERS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VERY DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN AND WHOEVER HAS READ THE DIVERS AND OFTEN CONTRADICTORY REASONINGS UPON THE SUBJECT MUST CLEARLY PERCEIVE THAT THERE IS STILL ROOM FOR DIS COVERIES IN THIS PART OF NATURAL HISTORY READ NOV 23 1769 YOU SIR BY YOUR ACCOUNTS OF FIXED AIR AND OF RATHBONEPLACE WATER RELATED IN THE LAST VOLUME OF PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS HAVE OBLIGED THE PUBLIC WITH MANY ADDITIONAL LIGHTS ON THIS BRANCH OF KNOW LEDGE AND FROM YOUR KNOWN ACCURACY AND DILIGENT PURSUITS IN MOST PHILOSOPHICAL INQUIRIES THE LEARNED WORLD HAS GREAT REASON TO HOPE FOR MANY OTHER NEW AND USEFUL IMPROVEMENTS TO YOUR JUDGMENT THERE FORE I SUBMIT THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTS WHICH ARE INTENDED TO SHEW THAT IRON IS SOLUBLE IN SIMPLE WATER BY217 BY THE INTERVENTION OF FIXED AIR AND THENCE THAT IT IS VERY PROBABLE MANY DIFFERENT CHALYBEATE SPRINGS SUSTAIN THEIR METALLIC CHARGE BY THIS MEANS ONLY THE SOLUTION OF IRON IN MINERAL WATERS ESPECIALLY IN SUCH AS BY EXPOSURE READILY LOSE THE PROPERTY OF STRIKING A PURPLE COLOUR WITH ASTRINGENT VEGETABLES HAS USUALLY BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO SOME SUBTILE GAS OR VO LATILE ACID CHYMISTRY HOWEVER DOES NOT DISCOVER ANY ACID SOLVENT FOR IRON BUT WHAT HAS GREATER AFFI NITY WITH ALCALIES AND BY MEANS OF WHICH THERE FORE THIS METAL WILL BE PRECIPITATED HENCE IF ANY WATER APPEARS WITH A PREDOMINANT ALCALI WHICH HAS ALSO THE POWER OF TINGING WITH GALLS AND ON BEING EXPOSED TO THE OPEN AIR LETS FALL THE IRON AND LOSES THAT PROPERTY MAY WE NOT CONCLUDE THE METAL TO HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED BY SOME OTHER MEDIUM THIS FOR EXAMPLE IS PLAINLY THE CASE IN GERMAN SPA WATER WHICH DR BROWNRIGG HAS PROVED TO ABOUND WITH FIXED AIR YOUR OWN VERY CURIOUS EX PERIMENTS BEFORE CITED HAVE CLEARLY SHEWN THAT CALCARIOUS EARTHS MAY BE SUSPENDED IN WATER BY THIS PRINCIPLE OF FIXED AIR AND THESE HAVE LED ME TO EXAMINE WHETHER IRON MIGHT NOT BE DISSOLVED BY THE SAME NATURAL MEANS I WOULD NOT HOWEVER BE SUPPOSED TO DENY THAT IRON IS FREQUENTLY FOUND UNITED WITH AN ACID THE FACT IS SUFFICIENTLY EVINCED IN THE PYRITES AND VI TRIOLIC EARTHS NOR CAN I DOUBT BUT THAT THESE SUB STANCES DO LARGELY CONTRIBUTE TO THE PRIMARY IMPREG NATION OF WATERS THEY BEING SO READILY SOLUBLE IN THEM BUT AS AN ALCALI OR ABSORBENT EARTH IS OFTEN FOUND MORE THAN SUFFICIENT TO SATURATE THE ACID IN MI NERAL WATERS THIS WOULD EFFECTUALLY DISENGAGE EVERY VOL LIX F F PARTICLE218 PARTICLE OF IRON DISSOLVED BY AN ACID UNLESS THE METAL WAS SUPPORTED BY SOME OTHER MENSTRUUM MY ENDEAVOURS THEREFORE TO DETECT THIS SOLVENT BY EXPERIMENTS ARE WHAT I NOW BEG LEAVE TO LAY BE FORE YOU IN THE ORDER I MADE THEM EXPERIMENT I A WIDEMOUTHED BOTTLE CONTAINING HALF A PINT OF DISTILLED WATER AND SIXTY GRAINS OF STEELFILINGS WAS SUSPENDED FORTYEIGHT HOURS OVER SOME DISTILLERS ME LASSES IN BRISK FERMENTATION SO AS TO RECEIVE THE FIXED AIR ESCAPING FROM THE FERMENTING LIQUOR THE SURFACE OF WHICH WAS TEN INCHES BELOW THE MOUTH OF THE BOTTLE IMMEDIATELY AFTER ITS REMOVAL THE CLEAR WATER WAS DECANTED FROM THE FILINGS AND OCHROUS SEDIMENT THIS LIQUOR HAD A BRISK AND FERRUGINOUS TASTE WITH A FLAVOUR OF THE MELASSES AN INFUSION OF GALLS OR GREEN TEA SOON CHANGED PART OF IT TO A COLOUR LIKE INK THE REMAINDER BEING EXPOSED TO THE OPEN AIR PRESENTLY BECAME TURBID THREW UP A PARTYCOLOURED PELLICLE AND DEPOSITED A YELLOWISH SEDIMENT THE WATER NOW RETAINED BUT VERY LITTLE POWER OF TINGING WITH GALLS AND IN A FEW DAYS LOST THIS PRO PERTY ENTIRELY EXPERIMENT II FOURTEEN OUNCES OF COARSE SUGAR DISSOLVED IN SEVEN PINTS OF WATER WERE MIXED WITH HALF A PINT OF YEAST IN A BOTTLE CAPABLE OF HOLDING MORE THAN TWICE THE ABOVE QUANTITY ONE END OF A BENT TUBE WAS LUTED INTO THIS VESSEL SO THAT NO AIR MIGHT ESCAPE BUT THROUGH THE219 THE TUBE THE OTHER END WAS LOOSELY INSERTED TWO INCHES WITHIN THE MOUTH OF ANOTHER LARGE BOTTLE CHARGED WITH FOUR HUNDRED GRAINS OF IRON FILINGS AND SIXTY OUNCES OF DISTILLED WATER AFTER REMAINING TWELVE HOURS IN THIS SITUATION THE SUGAR WORKING BRISKLY AN OUNCE PHIAL WAS LET DOWN GENTLY INTO THE BOTTLE AND FILLED THE WATER FROM THE PHIAL WITH ONE DROP OF TINCTURE OF GALLS  CHANGED IN A FEW MI NUTES TO A LIGHT ROSY PURPLE THE LIQUOR BEING SHAKEN AND ANOTHER PHIALFULL TAKEN UP SOON AFTER ONE DROP OF THE TINCTURE GAVE A DEEPER COLOUR THAN BEFORE IN AN HOUR AND HALF MORE AFTER BEING SHAKEN AGAIN THE PHIALFULL RECEIVED A STILL DEEPER PURPLE FROM THE LIKE QUANTITY OF TINCTURE THE BOTTLE CONTINUING AS BEFORE NEAR FIVE HOURS LONGER WHEN THE QUANTITY OF FIXED AIR FROM THE FERMENTING LIQUOR WAS SUPPOSED SUFFICIENT TO HAVE SATURATED THE WATER THE LIQUOR APPEARED VERY TURBID ON BEING SHAKEN AND AFTER STANDING ANOTHER HOUR UNDER THE TUBE TO SETTLE THE WHOLE WAS FILTERED THIRTY OUNCES OF THE CLEAR LIQUOR WAS POURED INTO TWO FLORENCE FLASKS AND THE REMAINDER INTO PHIALS WHICH WERE AFTERWARDS WELL CORKED TWO OF THESE PHIALS HAD THEIR CORKS DIPPED INTO MELTED RESIN SO AS TO COVER THE MOUTHS OF THE BOTTLES TWO OTHERS WERE ENCLOSED WITH A PASTE OR LUTE NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE PRECAUTIONS TO PREVENT THE ESCAPE OF AIR THE LIQUORS IN EACH SOON GREW TUR BID AND BY THE NEXT MORNING DEPOSITED YELLOW SE DIMENTS  THIS TINCTURE WAS MADE BY INFUSING HALF AN OUNCE OF POW DERED GALLS IN EIGHT OUNCES OF PROOF SPIRIT FOR FOUR DAYS WITHOUT HEAT F F 2 THIS220 THIS WATER HAD A SMART CHALYBEATE TASTE SOME WHAT RESEMBLING SPA WATER WITH A SLIGHT FLAVOUR OF THE FERMENTING LIQUOR ONE DROP OF TINCTURE OF GALLS GAVE A ROSY PURPLE COLOUR TO A WINEPINT OF THIS WATER SYRUP OF VIOLETS TURNED IT GREEN SOAP LEYS OR EVEN ALCALINE SALTS EITHER FIXED OR VO LATILE IN THEIR NATURAL STATES SOON CHANGED THIS LIQUOR GREEN AND RENDERED IT TURBID WHENCE A YELLOW SEDI MENT ENSUED BUT NEITHER OF THE ALCALINE SALTS WHEN PREVIOUSLY SATURATED WITH FIXED AIR PRODUCED ANY PERCEPTIBLE ALTERATION NOR DID ANY VISIBLE CHANGE HAPPEN ON THE ADDITION OF ACIDS THE THIRTY OUNCES OF WATER IN THE FLASKS BEFORE MENTIONED AFTER BEING BOILED TWENTY MINUTES TO EX PEL THE AIR BECAME VERY TURBID AND LET FALL SEDI MENTS THE CLEAR LIQUOR BEING DECANTED THE RE MAINDER WAS PASSED THROUGH A FILTER AND AFTER DRY ING THE PAPER APPEARED TO HAVE GAINED TWO GRAINS AND A QUARTER THIS OCHROUS RESIDUUM COULD NOT BE AGAIN DIS SOLVED IN WATER BY MEANS OF FIXED AIR BUT WAS SO LUBLE IN THE VITRIOLIC ACID THE SOLUTION DILUTED AND FILTERED RECEIVED NO COLOUR FROM GALLS UNTIL ALCALI WAS ADDED TO SATURATE THE REDUNDANT ACID AFTER WHICH IT STRUCK A PURPLE AS IN COMMON SOLUTIONS OF IRON  SIMPLE DISTILLED WATER SATURATED WITH FIXED AIR BY ANY MEANS I HAVE TRIED MAKES NO CHANGE IN SYRUP OF VIOLETS AND WHEN MIXED WITH SOAP DOES NOT CURDLE THE221 THE LIQUOR DECANTED AFTER BOILING NEITHER CHANGED COLOUR WITH GALLS NOR SHEWED ANY PRECIPITATION WITH LIMEWATER EXPERIMENT III A COMMON QUARTBOTTLE WAS HALF FILLED WITH DIS TILLED WATER TO WHICH WERE ADDED AN HUNDRED GRAINS OF STEELFILINGS TO THESE WAS INTRODUCED BY MEANS OF THE BENT TUBE AS MUCH FIXED AIR OBTAINED FROM A SOLUTION OF ALCALINE SALT IN THE VITRIOLIC ACID AS WAS JUDGED SUFFICIENT TO FILL THE BOTTLE THE WHOLE BE ING THEN SHAKEN WITH MY HAND OVER ITS MOUTH THE BOTTLE STUCK LIKE A CUPPINGGLASS ABOUT THE SAME QUANTITY OF AIR BEING AGAIN ADDED THE BOTTLE AFTER SHAKING HAD LESS ADHESION THAN BEFORE ON REPEAT ING THIS EXPERIMENT A THIRD TIME WITH FRESH AIR THE ADHESION WAS SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE AND AFTER THE FOURTH TRIAL A SMALL PORTION OF AIR WAS OBSERVED TO IS SUE FROM THE BOTTLE THE WATER NOW GAVE A DEEP COLOUR WITH TINCTURE OF GALLS THIS EXPERIMENT WAS REPEATED WITH FIXED AIR FROM DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS AS ALSO BY PASSING THIS AIR THROUGH A VESSEL OF PEARLASH TO ARREST ANY ACID WHICH MIGHT ESCAPE FROM THE EFFERVESCING MIXTURES BUT THE SOLUTIONS OF IRON IN ALL THE TRIALS APPEARED TO BE EXACTLY SIMILAR EXCEPT SOME TRIFLING DIFFERENCE IN TASTE AND SMELL EXPERIMENT IV A BOTTLE WITH THE LIKE QUANTITY OF STEELFILINGS AND DISTILLED WATER AS IN EXPERIMENT THE FIRST REMAINED IN222 IN A ROOM MANY WEEKS YET ALTHOUGH IT WAS FRE QUENTLY SHAKEN AND HAD AN OCHROUS SEDIMENT IT GAVE NO COLOUR WITH TINCTURE OF GALLS EXPERIMENT V A SINGLE GRAIN OF IRON IN SOLUTION DILUTED WITH A PINT OF DISTILLED WATER CHANGED TO A DEEP BLUE PURPLE WITH THE TINCTURE OF GALLS HALF A PINT OF THE LIKE MIXTURE EXPOSED MANY DAYS IN A WIDEMOUTHED GLASS COVERED LOOSELY WITH PAPER LET FALL A SLIGHT PRE CIPITATION BUT ITS PROPERTY OF TINGING WITH GALLS WAS NOT SENSIBLY DIMINISHED THE SAME QUANTITY BEING BOILED FOUR OR FIVE MINUTES IN A FLORENCE FLASK BE CAME TURBID AND DEPOSITED A SMALL PORTION OF AN OCHROUS SEDIMENT THE TINCTURE OF GALLS NEVER THELESS GAVE AS DEEP A COLOUR TO THE CLEAR LIQUOR AS IT WOULD HAVE DONE BEFORE BOILING THE FOREGOING EXPERIMENTS SEEM TO PROVE THAT IRON REMAINS QUITE UNAFFECTED BY PURE WATER BUT MAY EASILY BE DISSOLVED IN IT ON THE ADDITION OF FIXED AIR AND THAT IN WHATSOEVER MANNER THIS AIR IS GENERATED THE EVENT WILL APPEAR THE SAME THE LAST EXPERIMENT SHEWS THAT WHERE IRON IS SUSPENDED IN WATER BY AN ACID NEITHER EXPOSURE NOR BOILING WILL DESTROY ITS PRO PERTY OF TINGING WITH GALLS WHICH IS THE REVERSE OF WHAT WE FIND TO BE THE CASE WITH MANY FERRUGINOUS WATERS EXPERIMENT THE SECOND MORE PARTICULARLY  IRONFILINGS WERE DISSOLVED IN DILUTED OIL OF VITRIOL TO SATU RATION AND BY EXPERIMENT ONE GRAIN OF THE METAL WITH ABOUT TWO GRAINS AND A QUARTER OF THE ACID WERE FOUND TO BE CON TAINED IN SIXTYEIGHT GRAINS OF THE SOLUTION TEACHES223 TEACHES THAT THE IRON DISSOLVED IN WATER BY FIXED AIR IS AT LEAST EQUAL IN QUANTITY TO WHAT IS COMMONLY ASCRIBED TO MOST CHALYBEATE SPRINGS THAT THIS AIR BY WHICH THE METAL IS HELD IN SOLUTION IS SIMILAR TO THAT ELASTIC VAPOUR SO OFTEN MENTIONED BY WRITERS ON THESE SUBJECTS WHICH CANNOT BE WHOLLY RETAINED BY THE CLOSEST CORKING BUT GRADUALLY ESCAPING SUFFERS THE OCHROUS MATTER TO SUBSIDE AND THAT FIXED AIR HAS GREATER AFFINITY WITH ALCALIES THAN WITH IRON BECAUSE ADDITION OF ALCALINE SUBSTANCES NOT SATURATED WITH FIXED AIR WILL DISENGAGE THE METAL WHILE SUCH AS ARE CHARGED WITH THIS PRINCIPLE PRODUCE NO ALTERATION THESE CONCLUSIONS SEEMED TO ACCOUNT FOR MANY PARTICULARS RELATING TO MEDICATED SPRINGS BUT AS ALL MY TRIALS HAD BEEN MADE WITH IRON IN ITS METALLIC STATE WHICH IS RARELY FOUND IN NATURE IT WAS NECES SARY TO REPEAT THEM UPON THIS MINERAL IN THE STATE OF ORE I PROCEEDED THEREFORE TO DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTS UPON VARIOUS ORES BUT DID NOT FIND ANY OF THEM TO ANSWER MY EXPECTATION EXCEPT WHAT IS CALLED IRON SAND ORE WHICH SEEMS TO CONTAIN A PERFECT IRON THIS AT FIRST OFFERED A MATERIAL OBJECTION TO MY FORMER INFERENCE BUT UPON A LITTLE CONSIDERATION IT OCCURRED THAT WATERS BEING FIRST CHARGED WITH PYRI TICAL MATTER MIGHT AFTERWARDS HAVE THEIR ACID NEU TRALIZED WITH ALCALINE OR CALCARIOUS SUBSTANCES AND THE IRON YET REMAIN SUSPENDED BY AIR GENERATED IN THE SA TURATION AND I WAS THE MORE READY TO ADOPT THIS OPINION AS IT WOULD EXPLAIN VERY NATURALLY THE AP PLICATION OF FIXED AIR TO THIS BUSINESS OF SOLUTION WHICH I CONFESS HAD HITHERTO BEEN TO ME SOME WHAT DIFFICULT TO ACCOUNT FOR IT WAS NECESSARY HOWEVER TO EXAMINE THE TRUTH OF THIS THEORY BY THE224 THE TEST OF EXPERIMENT WHICH I DID IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER EXPERIMENT VI TO A PINT OF DISTILLED WATER MIXED WITH ONE GRAIN OF IRON DISSOLVED AS IN EXPERIMENT THE FIFTH WERE ADDED FORTY GRAINS OF SOAP LEYS AND TO TWO OUNCES OF LIMEWATER DILUTED WITH FOURTEEN OUNCES OF DISTILLED WATER WAS ADDED A GRAIN OF IRON IN SOLUTION IN BOTH CASES THE POINT OF SATURATION WAS INTENDED THE TWO MIXTURES INSTANTLY TURNED GREEN GREW TUR BID AND LET FALL SEDIMENTS OF THE SAME COLOUR THE LIQUORS BEING FILTERED GAVE NO TINGE WITH TINCTURE OF GALLS EXPERIMENT VII A QUART OF WATER WAS MIXED WITH TWO GRAINS OF IRON AS BEFORE TO ONE MOIETY THREE GRAINS OF SALT OF TARTAR IN SO LUTION WAS INSTILLED IT FIRST APPEARED GREEN SOON CHANGED YELLOW AND GAVE AN ORANGECOLOURED PRE CIPITATE TO ANOTHER PORTION TWO GRAINS OF POWDERED CHALK BEING ADDED IT PRESENTLY BECAME STRAWCOLOURED AND AFTER CONTINUING NINE HOURS IN A WELLCORKED PHIAL WAS YET TURBID WITH A YELLOW SEDIMENT THE WATERS BEING BOTH FILTERED PART OF EACH CHANGED TO A PURPLE WITH TINCTURE OF GALLS THE REMAINDER BEING BOILED A FARTHER PRECIPITATION EN SUED AND THE CLEAR LIQUOR NO LONGER PRODUCED ANY ALTERATION WITH GALLS 4 THIS225 THIS EXPERIMENT BEING REPEATED WITH MAGNESIA AND WITH THE EARTH OF ALUM SHEWED NO SENSIBLE DIF FERENCE THE QUANTITY OF IRON LEFT DISSOLVED IN THE LIQUOR WAS FOUND IN PROPORTION TO THE VOLUME OF AIR GE NERATED DURING THE SATURATION IF THE QUANTITY OF ALCALI OR ABSORBENT EARTH WAS IN SUFFICIENT TO SATURATE THE ACID PART OF THE IRON WOULD REMAIN IN THE WATER AFTER BOILING ALL WHICH WERE DISCOVERABLE BY THE TINCTURE OF GALLS EXPERIMENT VIII TO A PINT OF DISTILLED WATER BEING SATURATED WITH SIXED AIR AND CONTAINING FOUR GRAINS OF CHALK WAS ADDED A GRAIN OF IRON IN SOLUTION THE MIXTURE CON TINUED PELLUCID ANOTHER GRAIN OF DISSOLVED IRON WAS DILUTED WITH A LIKE QUANTITY OF WATER PREVIOUSLY SATURATED WITH AIR FROM A SOLUTION OF PEARLASH IN VITRIOLIC ACID EIGHT GRAINS OF SALT OF TARTAR CRYSTALLIZED WITH FIXED AIR AND DISSOLVED WERE ADDED TO THIS MIXTURE A SLIGHT DE GREE OF CLOUDINESS ENSUED BUT DISAPPEARED ON SHAK ING AFTER WHICH THE LIQUOR MUCH RESEMBLED SPA WATER ONLY IT TASTED STRONGER OF THE IRON THE QUANTITY OF CHALK AND ALCALINE SALT IN THIS EXPERI MENT WAS MORE THAN SUFFICIENT TO NEUTRALIZE THE ACID BOTH THE ABOVE MIXTURES ON EXPOSURE BECAME TURBID THREW UP PELLICLES DEPOSITED FERRUGINOUS SEDI MENTS AND LOST THEIR POWER OF STRIKING A PURPLE WITH GALLS VOL LIX G G SOLUTIONS226 SOLUTIONS OF IRON AND OF ITS ORES IN THE MARINE AND NITROUS ACIDS AS ALSO PYRITES DISSOLVED IN RAINWATER WERE SUBSTITUTED BY TURNS INSTEAD OF THE ORIGINAL IRON IN VITRIOLIC ACID AND THEY ALL GAVE A PURPLE COLOUR WITH TINCTURE OF GALLS THE TRIALS WERE REPEATED WITH LIMESTONE MARBLE ISLAND CRYSTAL OSTEOCOLLA AND MAGNESIA IN LIEU OF CHALK AND WITH VOLATILE AND MINERAL ALCALI REPLETE WITH AIR IN THE ROOM OF SALT OF TARTAR BUT NO MATE RIAL DIFFERENCE WAS OBSERVED THE SUCCESS OF THESE EXPERIMENTS COMPLEATLY AN SWERED MY EXPECTATIONS THEY SATISFIED ME THAT ANY ACID HOLDING IRON DISSOLVED AND DILUTED WITH WATER MIGHT NOT ONLY BE NEUTRALIZED BUT THE WATER CHARGED WITH AN EXCESS OF ALCALINE OR EARTHY MATTER WITHOUT PRECIPITATING THE METAL AND THAT THE SOLVENT IN THESE CASES COULD BE NO OTHER THAN FIXED AIR SINCE THE IRON REMAINED IN SOLUTION ONLY WHERE THIS PRINCIPLE ORIGINALLY ABOUNDED IN THE WATER OR WAS AFTERWARDS GENERATED IN THE SATURATION THUS MUCH BEING DETERMINED IT SEEMED EASY TO APPLY THE DISCOVERY TO THE MORE PERFECT ANALYZATION OF SOME WATERS AND TO THE REPRODUCTION OF OTHERS BY ART WHICH SHOULD EXACTLY RESEMBLE THOSE OF NATURAL MEDICATED SPRINGS THIS IS A TASK I SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE UNDERTAKEN AT LEISURE HAD I NOT BEEN INFORMED THAT DR WATSON JUNIOR BY WHOSE CONVERSATION MY THOUGHTS WERE FIRST LED TO THE SUBJECT IS ALREADY EN GAGED IN SOMETHING OF THIS SORT THIS GENTLEMAN SAW MANY OF THE FOREGOING EXPERIMENTS REPEATED AND AS HE IS SINCE GONE TO THE GERMAN SPA I DARE SAY HIS ABILITIES AND APPLICATION WILL SUFFICIENTLY IMPROVO THE227 THE OPPORTUNITY I SHALL GLADLY THEREFORE WAIT THE RESULT OF HIS ENQUIRIES TO CONCLUDE THEN IT APPEARS TO ME HIGHLY PRO BABLE THAT FIXED AIR IS GENERALLY NECESSARY TO THE IM PREGNATION OF MINERAL SPRINGS THAT BY THE RIGHT KNOWLEDGE OF THIS PRINCIPLE WE MAY NOW SOLVE MOST DIFFICULTIES THAT HAVE ARISEN ON THIS SUBJECT AND VERY POSSIBLY BE ABLE HEREAFTER TO IMITATE NATURE IN THE FORMATION OF MEDICATED WATERS WHETHER MY CON CLUSIONS ARE WELL FOUNDED I WITH PLEASURE REFER TO YOUR CANDID DECISION AND AM S I R WITH GREAT RESPECT YOUR MUCH OBLIGED HUMBLE SERVANT T LANE  G 2 XXXI ACCOUNT

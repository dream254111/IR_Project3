VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER THE JURISDICTION AND PRACTICE UNDER THE ACT OF CONGRESS APPROVED JUNE 11th 1906 RELAT ING TO THE LIABILITY OF COMMON CARRIERS TO THEIR EMPLOYEES It is designed to briefly note the jurisdiction and practice applicable to the recent act of Congress concerning the liability of common carriers engaged in interstate commerce under the act approved June 11th 1906 without attempting any discussion of the constitutionality of the act itself whLch is as follows An Act relating to liability of common carriers in the District of Columbia and Territories and common carriers engaged in commerce between the States and between the States and foreign nations to their employees Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of United States of America in Contgress assembled That every common carrier engaged in trade or commerce in the District of Columbia or in any Territory of the United States or between the several States or between any Territory and another or between any Territory or Territories and any State or States or the District of Columbia or with foreign nations or between the District of Columbia and any State or States or foreign nations shall be liable to any of its employees or in the case of his death to his personal representative for the benefit of his widow and children if any if none then for his parents if none then for his next of kin dependent upon him for all damages which may result from the negligence of any of its officers agents or employees or by reason of any defect of insufficiency due to its negligence in its cars engines appliances machinery track roadbed ways or works Section 2 That in all actions hereafter brought against any common carriers to recover damages for personal injuries to an employee or where such injuries have resulted in his death the fact that the employee may have been guilty of contributory negligence shall not bar a recovery where his contributory negli gence was slight and that of the employer was gross in com parison but the damages shall be diminished by the jury in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to such em ployee All questions of negligence and contributory negligence shall be for the jury Sec 3 That no contract of employment insurance relief benefit or indemnity for injury or death entered into by or on behalf of any employee nor the acceptance of any such insur ance relief benefit or indemnity by the person entitled thereto shall constitute any bar or defense to any action brought to 866 March1907 FEERAL LIABILITY OF CARRIER TO MPLOYEE recover damages for personal injuries to or death of such em ployee Provided hozeever That upon the trial of such action against any common carrier the defendant may set off therein any sum it has contributed toward any such insurance relief benefit or indemnity that may have been paid to the injured employee or in case of his death to his personal representative Sec 4 That no action shall be maintained under this act unless commenced within one year from the time the cause of action accrued Sec 5 That nothing in this Act shall be held to limit the duty of common carriers by railroads or impair the rights of their employees under the safetyappliance Act of March second eighteen hundred and ninetythree as amended April first eight een hundred and ninetysix and March second nineteen hundred and three The statute specifically applies to employees of common car riers or in case of the death of an employee to his personal representative for the benefit of his widow and children etc and to none others This is plain under the title of the act as well as in the language of the statute itself The suits being of a civil nature it is clear that the federal courts will have concurrent jurisdiction with the courts of the several states in all suits instituted under this act in accordance with the first section of the act of 1875 defining the original and general jurisdiction of the circuit courts of the United States as amended by the act of March 3rd 1887 This section as amended so far as pertinent is as follows That the circuit courts of the United States shall have orig inal cognizance concurrent with the courts of the several states of all suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity where the matter in dispute exceeds exclusive of interest and costs the sum or value of two thousand dollars and arising under the constitution and laws of the United States    The injured employee or his personal representative in case of his death who desires to enforce any liability incurred under this act may elect to sue either in the courts of the several states or in the circuit court of the United States in the latter case only where the jurisdictional amount exceeding 2000 is in volved If the plaintiff elects to sue in the state court he must observe 2 86712 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER the practice of that court as to the institution and conduct of the proceeding In Virginia therefore the practice as to the place of the institution of the suit service of process etc would conform to the practice now prevailing in all suits against common carriers that are corporations and against those other than corporations process would issue in accordance with  3228 Va Code The suit in the state court must therefore be instituted where the cause of action arose or at the place of the principal office of the defendant common carrier that is a corporation and the process of course must be served in accordance with the Vir ginia statute It would seem that the employee would have the right to further elect to institute his suit in the courts of the state other than that of which the defendant corporation is a citizen such place being where the cause of action arose or he may bring suit at the place of the principal office of the corporation in the state of which it is a citizen though the cause of action has arisen without that state Where the plaintiff elects to sue in the state court the de fendant has the right under  2 of the act of 1875 as amended by the act of 1887 25 St L 433 1st Sup Rev Stat 2nd Ed 611 to remove the suit to the eircuit court of the United States for the proper district provided the jurisdictional amount in excess of 2000 is in controversy In that court of course the proceeding will conform to the practice of the federal court obtaining in the respective states from which the case is re moved in accordance with  914 Rev State U S If the amount involved is not in excess of 2000 the plaintiff it would seem must sue alone in the state court The act of 1875 as amended by the act of March 3rd 1887 confines the jurisdiction of the circuit court of the United States in civil cases where the sum or value exceeds 2000 and the defendant in such case would not have the right of removal the jurisdic tional amount not being involved In cases arising under the act where the amount involved is 2000 or less both the plaintiff and the defendant would have the right to rely upon the act in the state court in other respects and the state court be governed thereby 868 March1907 FgDRAL LIABILITY OP CARRIER TO tMPLOYLE The plaintiff can sue in the state court under the act and claim its benefits regardless of the amount in controversy and regardless of the citizenship of the parties but the court would of course be governed by the decisions of the federal courts con struing and applying the act Either party it seems would be entitled to a writ of error from the final judgment in such cases under the 25th section of the judiciary act to the Supreme Court of the United States where the circumstances necessary for that court to assume jurisdiction concur If the state court in such case failed to apply the measure of damages provided under  2 of the act or otherwise denied the parties the benefit thereof it would seem that such decision would permit a writ of error on behalf of the plaintiff or de fendant from a final judgment of the state court to the supreme court of the United States If the plaintiff elects to sue in the courts of the United States he can only do so where the amount in controversy exceeds 2000 andmust institute his proceeding in the circuit court of the United States having jurisdiction of the place where the cause of action arose or at the place of the principal office of the defendant common carrier If the cause of action arises outside of the state of which the defendant common carrier is a citizen it would seem that the plaintiff would have a right to institute his suit in the circuit court of the United States having jurisdiction of the place in such foreign state where the cause of action arose or at his election he may sue at the place of the principal office of the common carrier in the state of which it is a citizen In some cases no doubt the plaintiff desiring to avail himself of the measure of recovery allowed under the statute may allege facts sufficient to prevent the declaration being demurrable but the defendant of course will have the right by proper plea to have those preliminary questions tried and in all cases the federal court will ultimately be the judge whether or not the liability is enforceable under the act in question If the suit is originally instituted in the circuit court of the United States or removed there by the defendant from the state court the course of appeal from the circuit court would of 86912 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER course be to the circuit court of appeals for the proper judicial circuit It may be that in such cases the plaintiff may desire to avoid the provisions of  3 of the act and may not sue thereunder but invoke the law of the state In this event the defendant would nevertheless it seems if the injury in fact occurred while the carrier was engaged in interstate commerce have the right to rely upon the act and avail itself by proper procedure of the setoff allowed to it urider  3 In cases not removed or removable from the state courts the trials will be governed by the practice of these courts though of course the law of the case will be the statute itself as con strued and applied by the courts of the United States and in cases instituted in or removed to the courts of the United States the trials will be in accordance with the federal practice sub ject however in both courts to the very farreaching provisions of  2 of the act as to contributory negligence in terms imposing upon the jury the decision of all questions of negligence and contributory negligence We do not suppose however that even this sweeping provision of the statute deprives the courts state or federal of the right of directing or setting aside the verdict of the jury JOHN T

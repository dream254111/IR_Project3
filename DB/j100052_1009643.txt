including the two cities of Pittsburg and Allegheny has inaugurated a plan for promoting the practical cooperation of charitable organizations and the elimination of that element of the poor who make a practice of living on charity by for ing a Charity Clearing House through which all applications for charitable relief and aid must pass The plan was tried with success on a limited scale in Allegheny under the administration of Mayor William M Kennedy the chairman of the clubs committee having the matter in charge The committee has sent to every organization church and society affording charity relief of any kind a list of questions to place it in possession of the information needed to make the plan a success The committee has also issued the following circular We have been requested to take steps to secure the organization of all the charities in the cities of Pittsburg and Allegheny so that each may know from what sources an applicant or recipient is receiv ing aid The indiscriminate bestowal of charity fills our streets and almshouses with paupers encourages idleness and begging  It is not purposed to curtail or in any way interfere with your work but with the assistance of all to so formulate the work that a complete record will be kept in such a way that no one can receive aid from more than one source without being discovered It is a well known fact that today families are being kept in our cities in very comfortable circumstances by receiving aid from many sources Large sums are spent by a number of societies in investigation the results of which are only useful for the present purposes of the one making the inquiry If this same work were done by a central organization in which all had a common interest and to which all could apply the record of the investigation would be useful so long as the subject lived This record should be equally accessible to every person Not only will this result in a large saving of money but will relieve us from the uncomfortable feeling that we are being constantly imposed upon by unworthy persons We hope at no distant date if you will give us your help to have all the charitable work carried on in our cities so systematized that by sending the name and address to a central office you will in a few hours be fully informed as to the worthiness of the one about whom  Contributed by Hon Clinton Rogers Woodruff 313ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY you inquire Within a short time you will be asked to send a repre sentative to a convention at which will be taken final action to carry out the purposes toward which we are now working Civic IdealsMr Frederic Harrison spoke recently to the students of the University Extension Societys Summer Meeting at the London University on the topic An Ideal London Whatever Mr Harrison has to say possesses a certain interest for a large circle of readers and although he does not take up the question of the ideals underlying modern city life from a strictly economic or social point of view some of his suggestions as to what would make modern London an ideal city are worthy of consideration He spoke first of the past and of the great changes that he had seen in London during sixty years residence there He then began to upbraid the modern Londoner for his lack of pride in his city and for the absence of high ideals concerning its possibilities Lastly he drew a picture of what London might be Such ideals may seem to the prosaic and skeptical somewhat visionary but they help along all the practical movements for the realization of brighter and better conditions of existence The following is an extract from the report of Mr Harrisons address as published in London for June i6 1898  It was one of the weak sides of moder civilization that it failed to set any limits to city life as they were known to the medieval world Of all nations the English took the least pride in her cities The historic cities of the world seemed to embody an epoch of civilization in themselves The ancients very idea of civilization implied a mother city as its home But with the English it was different The poor countryman too often regarded London as a place where he could get busy life variety and cheap amusement To the rich countryman it was a place where he could buy all things that money could furnish and when the three months Vanity Fair was over he would rush off with his purchases To the man of business it was a place where his toil energy and skill would enable him to make his fortune that in his old age he might retire to some rural retreat The city suffered within and without from this unworthy motive It was not thus that Rome Venice and Florence were looked upon by their citizens Nor was London so looked upon by the citizens in the time of the Norman and Plantagenet kings Elizabeth and the Stuarts The London of today was not a city It was a wilderness of houses There was an old saying that you cannot see the forest for trees  so they might say of London that they could not see the city for houses The ideal city the London that is to be would not exceed two million of inhabitants and its area would be less than onethird An ideal city must be coitrolled by limits of numbers and area How 314 142SOCIOLOGICAL NOTES this would be effected neither his time nor powers would enable him to tell them The thing was possible and within the conditions of modern civilization Why need they regard as hopeless a better state of affairs when they remembered what had taken place even in his time  Those who studied the topographical history of great cities could hardly say what bounds need be applied to the physical formation of the great cities They had witnessed in Paris London and elsewhere whole areas devastated and swept away to make way for magnificent avenues huge palaces and public structures They had seen great crowded centres of small houses depleted and replaced by vast blocks of tene ments This radical state of change was going on at a great pace and was rapidly transforming London He was no lover of tenements in themselves the ideal tenement had yet to be built But if people would live in cities of some millions they must adopt the tenement system As it was ninetenths of London did live in tenements or lodgings already only the lodgings were too often small rotten unwholesome old houses with only an average of about ten persons to the house whereas there might well be fifty or one hundred The ideal London tenement will be beautifully designed blocks each provided with baths lifts library playroom sickroom and even a mortuary All those conveniences and luxuries which are now only available for the few will be available for the many by wise cooperation With the ideal tenement system London would be swept of onequarter of its houses and this enormous area could be utilized for beautiful parks and broad boulevards even if the population continued to exceed 4000000 souls  The causes of excessive population and area were really temporary and incidental to political and economical conditions and were always subject to reaction He did not value Mother Shiptons prophecy that Hampstead Heath would eventually be the centre of London The parks and open spaces should be doubled if not trebled There should be a park within one mile of every mans doorstep if ideal life is to be possible One of the greatest wants of London was good play groundsplaygrounds of the size of the Oval and Lords During the last few years a great move has been made in the direction of pro viding recreation grounds and what has been done in Battersea Victoria and Regents Parks and elsewhere showed what they could do But they had not used all their opportunities The Thames in the ideal London would run as clear and pure as it did at the intake The great embankment would be carried along both sides of the river the whole length of the city with beau tiful wooded avenues making it as charming as the Richmond and 315 I43ANNAIS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY Twickenham of today The wharves would be carried underneath to docks leaving the embankment clear and open for traffic We should be carried up and down the river not by the present puffy smoky steam ers but by swift and graceful electric launches Steam engines of all kinds would be expelled from the city while in the good time coming no smoke will poison the air from millions of houses nor will ten thousand factory chimneys be suffered to belch forth fumes charged with soot to destroy our flowers and begrime our statues and buildings Such desecration would seem an abomination and crime to be repressed by law The citizens of ideal London when they read their history will hardly believe that such a thing was possible in the nineteenth ceitury In the good time coming rivers of pure water will be carried by aqueducts as they were in Rome Our water supply will come from inexhaustible lakes and reservoirs Rome with its eighteen aqueducts has never been surpassed In the good time coming they would not buy water from private speculators and the citizens of the ideal city would be surprised at the idea that we haggled in the market for our water As in Rome too baths would be established in every main thoroughfare Pure fresh water would be regarded as a necessity of liealth and as a primary public consideration Sanitary reform will do much in the reduction of the deathrate Sanitary science will not have said its last word until every sewer has been freed from poisonous gas as is the sink in every wellordered house In the last one hundred years the deathrate of London has been reduced by onehalf in spite of the enormous increase in population and during the last ten years it has been further reduced to eighteen per one thousand of the population But with purer water fresher air and more open spaces and the spread of science in preventable dis eases the deathrate in ideal London might be reduced to eight or ten per one thousand of the population and made the most healthy spot in Europe  The hospitals of ideal London will not be huge palaces occupying the most favored sites to support the medical traditions and to attract attention to themselves A number of small accident hospitals would be erected at convenient spots throughout London while the general hospitals would be removed to healthy suburbs where the patients would be transferred in trains and cars with lightning rapidity by some wonderful mechanical means He had no doubt that London would return to the ancient and honored custom of cremation in disposing of its dead instead of allowing the remains to decay in cemeteries in our midst and become a source of infection to all around The ashes of the sacred remains 3161 144SOCIOLOGICAL NOTES would beplaced ill urns and deposited either il the churches in specially constructed mosques in graveyards above or under ground in public or private yet void of offence where they coull be visited by the family with perfect ease National rowthThe annual address delivered before the Phli Beta Kappa Society of the University of Pennsylvania on June 7 1898 was given by Professor George Wharton Pepper who took for his topic  Our National Constitution as Related to National Growth a consideration of certain aspects of tile war with Spain Of Mr Peppers familiarity with questions of constitutional law and of his competency to speak on this subject there is abundant proof in the pages of the above address as published by the University of Penn sylvania A few passages will indicate the general trend of thought throughout the address In speaking of a centurys growth in our national life and institutions Mr Pepper reverts to the words of Washington concerning foreign entanglements and says To beware of the entanglements incident to foreign alliances was just such wise counsel as one would expect from the Father of his Country in speak ing to the nation in its childhood We may choose acquaintances for our children and keep them from contact with influences which seenm to us to threaten harm It can no longer be so when they have grown to malls estate The time must come when our admonitions cease to bind tliem when it is no longer possible or even expedient to attempt to control their free development Nations like individuals have work to do in their day and generation Like individuals they must make the world better for having lived in it There is such a thing as national character and it must be developed as individual char acter is developed In all phases of life the law of growth is a law of progress through struggle in the physical world the moral world the social world No progress can be true progress unless it costs There is therefore something childlike in the simplicity of those who are surprised to find that the universal law still holds and that the step from Spanish barbarism to English civilization can be taken only at the price of blood There are those amongst us who suppose that a dynastycan be made to die without a strugglethat Spain might peacefully have been persuaded to commit suicide that one of the proudest and least enlightened nations could have beeln nade to humble itself under the influence of pure reason What is there in our experience to warrant such a belief Children continue to be born in pain Character is still sanctified only by suffering Society is purified only by the operation of forces which for the nonce seem destined to overthrow it Our nation has suddenly awakened we know not why or how to a sense of her duty to civilization 317 I45146 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY Ill speaking of constitutional limitations to legislative action Mr Pepper says As is well known it is the peculiar function of the American judiciary to determine whether or not an act of congress or of a state legislature is constitutional The exercise of this vast power may be regarded as essential to a written constitution The supremacy of the judiciary over the legislature has been our boast  By a use of the judicial power that may well be regarded as inspired Marshall after Washington the greatest of Americans found it possible to make of us a nation By a wise exercise of the same power Miller and Bradley worthy successors of the great chief justice have removed the barriers interposed by states to even check the flow of national commerce Three important decisions are then discussed by the author the legal tender decision the income tax decision and the recent Nebraska transportation rates decision Emphasis is laid upon the fact that such decisions and indeed all decisions on constitutional points operate under our system practically as a part of the constitution of the future They are therefore often essentially limitations placed upon the exercise of sovereign powers The greater the responsibility accepted by the courts the more unworthy of confidence our legis lators become They no longer feel themselves to be the ultimate custodians of tlle liberties of the people They assume that the declaration of the unconstitutionality of an act redresses all wrongs and makes dangerous consequences impossible That such a declara tion by a court is a declaration which is of present advantage to the community no one can deny We are apt to forget however that every such decision becomes a part of our constitutional law and while it is a means of averting a present evil it may prove itself a source of serious trouble in the future It may be a good thing to protect those who control great municipal franchises from uncon scionable legislation by state legislatures by municipal councils and by boards of aldermen It may be a very serious thing to find our selves hampered by a long line of decisions rendered to vindicate such rights when the time comes for our municipalities to follow the example of the municipalities of the old world and place in the hands of the people the control and exercise of these protected franchises To those who rely upon the constitution as a sufficient objection to interpose in the discussion of new social legislation Mr Pepper replies  We have as a nation supposed that present conditions are eternal that existing economic conceptions are unchangeable and that by crystallizing them under the protection of a constitution we can check all onslaught upon them Fatal mistake What is a constitu tion that it should be so interpreted as to fetter a nations growth 318SOCIOLOGICAL NOTS Suppose all thle people say We will have an income tax and have it at once It is like the legal tender question The constitutional restraint imposed by the judicial decision would quickly melt away If not all the people but a great majority were to raise this cry the effect ultimately would be the same The constitution is as nothing when it ceases to reflect the nations will Do we delude ourselves by supposing that this nation is to be held back from territorial acquisition by the failure of our constitution to make express provi sion for colonial government  Do we propose to meet the singletax advocate by telling him that even if he convinces the nation the con stitutional difficulties in his way are insuperable Do we fondly dream that we are giving a conclusive answer to the socialist when we tell him that our constitution does not permit an acceptance of his theories Fatal misconception of a constitution We must meet each adversary in the open and unhorse him in a fair fighta fight fought in defence of the system for which the constitution stands We must not take refuge behind the constitution for the sake of avoiding the fight The constitution needs our protection Its function is not primarily to protect us Summer School in Philanthropy The training class in philan thropic work recently conducted during six weeks June 20 to July 30 by the New York Charity Organization Society has proven a suc cessful experiment The members of the class twentysix in number besides many visitors represented eleven statesfrom Massachusetts to California and included graduate students from fourteen educational institutions Columbia University Yale Radcliffe College Vassar Brown University Smith College Bryn Mawr Cornell Franklin College Bellevue Training School the Universities of Michigan Wisconsin Ohio and Leland Stanford Jr Those members who were iiot graduate students represented in each case some experience in philanthropic work and were members of charity organization societies residents of settlements or leaders in social reform in their respective cities How it may be asked was so high a standard of membershin secured including workers so widely separated as Mr Lincoln E Brown of Hale House in Boston and Mrs Mary Roberts Smith professor in Leland Stanford Jr University Miss Alice S Taylor general secretary of the Charity Organization Society in Providence and Mrs Anna Garlin Spencer of that city and Miss Katherine Conyngton and Mr E T Towne graduate students in the University of Wisconsin  The answer is this Contributed bv Philip W Ayres Ph D New York Charity Organization Society 319 147148 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY In the first place a careful plan was outlined and a group of speak ers of recognized authority in their several fields of work secured after which announcements were made not only in Charities and the Charities Review but also by ten or more teachers of economics in leading universities to their classes Furthermore starting well the work grew as the class advanced from day to day The plan required no tuition but that each member of the class should enter the service of the Charity Organization Society Each was to write one minor and one major report upon some subject connected with philanthropic work in New York City each was to have at least two weeks of actual work in the district offices of the society each to have one or two families in special care each was to read for general preparation Warners American Charities and to visit the almshouse and jail of his community The daily classwork and visits to institutions were arranged by subjects the first week being devoted to the management of private charitable societies and relief agencies the second to the care of dependent and delinquent children the third to public chari ties and outdoor relief the fourth to the sick poor the fifth to the health and street cleaning departments improved dwellings and other municipal and social improvements the sixth to prisons and prison ers with a return at the close to the subject of unity and cooperation in philanthropic work This plan with some minor changes was carried out The list of major reports follows The Abuse of Medical Charities in New York City Trained Nursing in New York Homes for Working Women Lodging Houses for Men Treatment of Delinquent Children Kindergartens in New York Day Nurseries and Creches in New York Social Settlements An Analysis of Pcpulations in New York The Hungarian Colony in New York The Italians of New York The Colored People of New York The Bohemian Colony in New York A Study of Food Values A Comparison of Registration in Charity Organization Societies in Brooklyn and New York Street Cleaning Department in New York Playgrounds for Children Relief Employment Bureaus and Industrial Agencies Public School Sittings in New York Newspaper Charities The Savings of the Poor A Study of the United Hebrew Charities The Financial Management of Charitable Institutions 320SOCTOLOGICAI NOTPES Social Relationships in Small Towns The Arrival anld Disposition of Immigrants Improved Tenements in Greater New York The program of speakers and of visits to philanthropic enterprises included much of the best that New York has to offer The super intendents of the leading societies took a cordial interest in the class There were addresses by Mr Homer Folks secretary of the State Charities Aid Association by Miss M V Clark of the same society by Mr N S Rosenau of the United Hebrew Charities by Dr William H Tolmuan and Mrs Fullerton of the Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor by Mrs Lucy S Bainbridge of the City Mission and Tract Society by Mr James B Reynolds of the University Settlement by Miss Mary M Kingsbury of the College Settlement and by Mr William I Nichols of the Brooklyn Bureau of Charities Each described his or her work giving opportu nity for discussion of the principles involved There were also the officials of the several departments and city institutions Mr J W Kellar president of the Charities Commissioners of the Greater New York Mr Robert W Hebberd secretary of the Board of State Charities Colonel George E Waring whose administration of the Street Cleaning Department amounted to an original creation for the city these and the several superintendents at the institutions visited aided in explaining the best methods involved in caring for their re spective wards In considering medical and hospital work the class had Dr S F Hallock for many years connected with the New York Demilt Dis pensary and Dr Henry S Chapin whose large experience among sick children makes him an authority These two though still young are veterans in the service Addresses were given also by Mr Jacob A Riis Dr E I Gould and Dr J S Billings the lastnamed with Professor MayoSmith of Columbia University speaking on the gathering and study of statistics in a way that determined each mem ber of the class to do his own work henceforth in a scientific manner A group of speakers from other cities brought to the class added intensity of interest The first of these was Mrs Glendower Evans of Boston whose description of the Lyman School for boys made the class skeptical of all other institutions for children in which the managers said eighty per cent of the graduates do well With the most painstaking care and careful supervision of graduates the Lyman School is unable to report more than seventy per cent doing well which leads to the conclusion that those who claim more really confess ignorance Mr Frank B Sanborn of Concord Mass gave 321 I49150 ANNALS OF THK AMERICAN ACADEMY a mlasterly address upon the curability of the insane Mrs Ellen C Johnson superintendent of the Massachusetts Reformatory Prison fbr Women at Sherborn touched the hearts and consciences of her hearers by enumerating the many ways by which the soul of the criminal woman may be touched and lifted up Dr S M Lindsay of the University of Pennsylvania gave the closing address showing the difficulties to be overcome by charitable workers who strive to secure cooperative action in widely diversified charities of a modern city As an illustration of how each of the topics was takell up and studied that of prisons and prisoners will serve The class visited the several police courts the station house lockups tlle Tombs House of Refuge Workhouse the Penitentiary on Blackwells Island and Sing Sing Prison thus observing the whole category of prison expe riences There were addresses by Mrs Johnson as indicated by Mr David Willard teacher of the Tombs by Colonel 0 V Sage warden of Sing Sing Prison and last but not least one of the most enjoyable trips which the class made to Grovelawn at College Point the home of Mr William M F Round secretary of the New York State Prison Association where addresses were given by Mr Round on the refor Ination of prisoners and care of discharged prisoners and an address by MrKimball the New York agent of the Elmira Reformatory No account of this first training class in philanthropy would be coum plete without reference to the almost daily attendance of Mrs Charles R Lowell whose kindly influence in leading each member of the class to see his individual brother in need among the poor was never failing The question naturally arises what bearing has this experimental class upon the plan for an endowed school of phlilanthropy as sug ested by Miss Richmond in the last number of the ANNALS  If it were not already sufficiently clear before the class has helped to demonstrate that there are at work a body of intelligent and trained people who do not feel that their studies or their work have given to them sufficient opportunity for practical observation in the phian thropic field at large Hence it is that the charitable workers fromr various cities the residents in settlements and college teachers were attracted even by this brief course In the second place it is to be noted that the general training which the student secures in a univer sity with or without postgraduate work does not fit him to take up technical administrative work in philanthropy It is this tecll nical knowledge of how to do it that is required of each new worker Whatever school of philanthropy may hereafter be estab lished it should not be closely affiliated with any university or 322SOCIOLOGICAL NOTS other educational institution to which the student will go to  take a course but rather it should hold the student to actual and useful philanthropic work with just enough guidance to help him in his work to synthetic thought Such a school of philanthropy which would not be a school at all but merely a group of scholarships enabling its students under a competent director to work for certain periods in several different cities and institutions will probably yield better results than any pro longed training in any one place Such a group of students could at certain times in the year be brought togetller for class instruction when they might be joined by the workers already started but seeking wider observation They could thus meet several specially well known workers but even this should have breadth and variety in practice rather than instruction about the  defective dependent and delinquent classes The scholarships should be generous in amount in order to attract the highest grade of our university graduates In such a plan everything would depend upon the care with which per sons were chosen to go into special training The analogy of a training school for library work has been used There are libraries that are not willing to receive the librarians trained iu a librarians school and prefer to train their own there would doubtless be institutions like the Elmira Reformatory preferring to train their own workers rather than to have any one  halfspoiled  by tnie school To be sure the library training schools have aided greatly in improving the administrative work in hundreds of smaller libraries but we do not want to start a training school that does not command the confidence of our highly specialized institutions To secure tlis confidence of the highly specialized the writer believes that a system of scholarships in the hands of a competent director will avoid the evils of conventionality so likely to injure even the best group of courses that any localized school of philan thropy may be able to offer Where are the publicspirited men who will bless their fellowmen by establishing a group of working scholarships for the benefit of charitable institutions at large I51

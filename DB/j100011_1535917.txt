UNDULANS FLORENCE A WATTERS It has been shown by Pearl o7 that in Paramcecium cultures the conjugants differ from the nonconjugants in size and varia bility and that a correlation in size occurs between the two members of conjugating pairs He has shown by statistical methods i that the conjugants are less variable in size than the nonconjugants 2 that the conjugants show a smaller mean size than the nonconjugants and 3 that a marked correlation in size exists between the members of the conjugating pairs the smaller uniting with the smaller and the larger with the larger Jennings I  took up the problem of size relationships in Paramwecium going into discussion of the reasons for the condi tions found which he based on very careful observations of the conditions existing in his cultures After careful measurement of a great many individuals he confirmed the results obtained by Pearl i e I that the conjugants are smaller than the non conjugating population of a culture 2 that they are less variable than the nonconjugants and 3 that there is a marked correlation in size between the members of the pairs so that on the whole larger individuals are found mated with larger smaller individuals with smaller It was with the idea of investigating the size relationships in another related form that the present work on Blepharisma undulans was taken up It will be possible here to give the facts of the size relationships only as they were found in material already mounted The individuals under consideration are from a pureline culture isolated at Woods Hole on July 20 I9II by Professor Calkins The six lots with which I shall deal were killed by him at various times during October I911 by means of sublimate acetic stained with Hoyers picrocarmine and mounted permanently in Canada balsam In measuring the individuals a Leitz projectoscope was used I95FLORENCE A WATTERS to throw a projection of each one upon the drawing table below A permanent record of each one was obtained by drawing a line perpendicular to the long axis at each end The figures given are the measurements of the projections rather than of the individuals themselves and are I92 times the actual size Thus in the table Longest Mm Shortest Mm Average Mm Nonconjugants  425 I35 2767 Conjugants  300 155 2012 the size of the projection rather than the actual size is given Translated these figures would be Longest ft Shortest u Average u Nonconjugants  22135 7031 I 4411 I Conjugants   15625 7812 10479 But since it is the relative length rather than the absolute length which is of importance in this case it has not seemed necessary to divide all the numbers given below by I92 and the figures denoting the size of the projection stand in the statistics which follow For the sake of overcoming any element of personal error which may have entered into the measurements all meas urements falling half way between one mm mark and the next are considered with those 5 mm larger The results obtained by careful measurements of six lots of Blepharisma undulans are in accord with the results obtained by Pearl 07 and Jennings Ii i e in Blepharisma undulans i the mean length of the conjugants is less than the mean length of the nonconjugants 2 the variation in length is much less among the conjugants than among the nonconjugants and 3 the correlation in size between the two members of a pair is distinctly marked the larger mating with the larger and the smaller with the smaller To take up first the difference in length between the conjugants and nonconjugants Table I shows that in all six lots the mean length of the conjugants is less than that of the nonconjugants1 Plate I shows that the mean length of the 1 The ordinates indicate the size of the individuals while the abscissas indicate the number of individuals thus the position of the column indicates the size while the height of the column indicates the number of individuals I96SIZE RELATIONSHIPS IN BLEPHARISMA UNDULANS 197 conjugants of lot I is 2I units and that the number of individuals increases rather rapidly from the extremes 17 and 30 toward the mean 2I also that the mean length of the nonconjugants is 29 and that the number of individuals increases slowly at first and then more rapidly from the extremes I8 and 40 to the mean 29 The average lengths of the conjugants and nonconjugants is in accord with the mean length being greater in the case of the nonconjugants and less in the case of the conjugants Table I Plate II shows that the mean length of the conjugants of lot 2 is less than the mean length of the nonconjugants the former being 22 and the latter 32 The number of individuals of the conjugants and nonconjugants increases from the extremes I85 and 28 in the case of the former and I85 and 425 in the case of the latter to the means 22 and 32 That the increase from extremes to means is much more gradual in lot 2 than in lot I is due to the fact that there are over twice as many individuals in lot I as in lot 2 The average length of the conjugants is less than that of the nonconjugants as in lot i being 2346 and 3388 respectively TABLE I SIZE

meanFLORENCE A WATTERS length of the former being 21 and that of the latter 25 The averages are 2006 and 2494 respectively The rapid increase in the number of individuals from the extremes I65 and 27 and I35 and 335 respectively is due to the larger number of indi viduals present in lot 3 Lot 4 Plate IV shows the same relative conditions as those found in the other lots the mean lengths of conjugants and nonconjugants being 20 and 29 respectively while the average lengths are 2077 and 2665 The small number of individuals occurring in lot 4 accounts for the lowness of the columns Lot 5 Plate IV is like lot 4 in the number of individuals and in the shortness of the columns There is greater irregularity of outline in lot 5 than in any other of the six lots but the mean length of conjugants and nonconjugants is in accord with the mean length of the other lots the former being 22 and the latter 27 Lot 6 Plate IV agrees with the rest in having the mean and average lengths of the conjugants smaller than those of the non conjugants the means being 23 and 32 and the averages 2280 and 3128 respectively Thus in every one of the six lots the mean and average have been less in the case of the conjugants than in that of the nonconjugants the difference being from 5 to 10 units in the case of the means and from 2 to 10 in the case of the averages From all this we should expect to find that the mean and average of the total number of conjugants are less than those of the total number of nonconjugants This is the case the mean for the total number of conjugants being 2I and the average 2012 and the mean for the total number of non conjugants being 27 and 28 or 275 and the average 2767 One interesting fact appears in Table I and Plates I to IV which is shown best in Plates IV and V i e the population including conjugants and nonconjugants shifts toward the left or right in the various lots Plate V shows this for the non conjugants of lots I 2 and 3 the means being 29 32 and 25 and the extremes I8 and 40 I9 and 43 and I4 and 34 respectively The means of the nonconjugants of lots 4 5 and 6 Plate IV are 29 27 and 32 respectively while the extremes are I8 and 35 19 and 34 and 17 and 40 The conjugating populations do not show I98SIZE RELATIONSHIPS IN BLEPHARISMA UNDULANS this so well since they vary less than the nonconjugating popu lations This brings us to the consideration of the second of the three problems i e the variation of conjugants and nonconjugants Table I shows very clearly that the variation between the extremes in the case of the conjugants is much less than that in the case of the nonconjugants being in the six lots 135 95 i05 95 7 85 in the former 22 24 20 i65 I65 235 in the latter the variation ranging from nearly two times to nearly three times as great in the case of the nonconjugants It is probable that some of the shortest nonconjugants are exconjugants which would however not change the general results very appreciably Finally the third problem as to co6rdination in size of the members of the same pair appears By plotting a graph using the length of the shorter of the two individuals as abscissa and the longer as ordinate the number of pairs of each combination which appeared was obtained Then by adding diagonally I obtained the number of pairs in which the individuals varied less than 5 mm or 22 microns actual measurement which varied 5 mm I mm 15 mm etc the following table resulting TABLE II CORRELATION IN SIZE OF MEMBERS OF CONJUGATING PAIRS Pairs Both members equal in length  35 One member shorter by 05 mm  57 One member shorter by Io mm  62 One member shorter by 15 mm  50 One member shorter by 2o mm  34 One member shorter by 25 mm  I7 One member shorter by 30 mm 9 One member shorter by 35 mm  8 One member shorter by 40 mm  2 One member shorter by 45 mm  2 One member shorter by 5o mm  2 One member shorter by 55 mm  I No two members of the same pair show a greater variation than 55 mm though conjugating individuals of different pairs show as great a variation as I45 mm and out of 279 pairs of con I99FLORENCE A WATTERS jugants only 7 pairs show a greater variation than 35 mm This indicates a very definite correlation of size between the two members of the conjugating pairs The same conditions which Pearl 07 and Jennings ii found to exist in Paramoecium then have been shown to exist in the case of Blepharisma undulans i e i the mean length of the conjugants is less than that of the nonconjugants 2 the variation of the conjugants is less than that of the noncon jugants and 3 there is a definite positive correlation in size between the members of the conjugating pairs the larger uniting with the larger individuals and the smaller with the smaller REFERENCES Pearl R 07 A Biometrical

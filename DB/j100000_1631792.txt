discussions of weather elements not on the basis of monthly and annual averages but on that of cyclonic control A further contribution to such investigations is a report by J A Udden On the Cyclonic Distribution of Rainfall Augustana Library Publications No 4 1905 The method employed is the one familiarly known as the composite portrait method The general region of a cyclone is divided into twentyfive areas separated by four concentric circles and by a series of eight radii The precipitation wind direction and cloudiness shown on the 8 AM weather maps for a series of selected stations were entered in the appropriate divisions and the results then summarized and charted The stations are Davenport Iowa Amarillo Dodge City Wichita Oklahoma Helena Miles City Leander Boise City Detroit and Buffalo In some cases the observations relate to the year 1899 only in others the period covers several years CLIMATIC NOTES ON THE SAHARA Last summer Professor E F Gautier of Algiers crossed the Sahara between Algeria and the Niger River being the first explorer to cross this wide part of the desert since Laing was murdered near Timbuktu in 1826 Gautier says that the Sahara viewed as a desert is much less extensive than has gen erally been believed The Adrar plateau from 2300 to 2700 feet above sealevel is not properly speaking a waste and while he was still 360 miles from Gao on the Niger he reached a wide belt of steppe which is the merging of the Sudan with the Sahara This steppe region has its rainy season with about six to twelve inches of precipitation every year This quantity suffices to cover the land with ponds and grass Animal life is abun dant Gautier distinguishes between the Tuaregs who ride oil camels and those who use horses The first inhabit the drierregions the Tua regs who use horses are on the whole more numerous and live in the steppe region and along the Niger The explorer found abundant evidences that this part of the Sahara once had a very large population of the Neolithic period of develop ment His finds included many arrowpoints and axes of polished stone Even the waste regions were inhabitable until a comparatively recent period Proofs of this are found in the thousands of drawings upon the rocks the graves in which everywhere the same kinds of implements and other objects were found and the stones used for grinding grain  These stones show that agriculture was practised here and that civilization was considerably advanced The gradual desiccation of this region ad vanced from the Sudan Today however the rainbelt is again extending more and more to the north Gautier distinguishes these three epochs the first was marked by dense population the second by desert condi tions and in the third or present period the land is again assuming a steppelike character Bull Am Geogr Soc Jan 1906 METEOROLOGY OF THE SOUTH ATLANTIC OCEAN THE Meteorological Committee London has published a twelvepage pamphlet on the relation between pressure temperature and air circulation over the South Atlantic Ocean this being a summary of the facts set forth on a series of elaborate charts published pre viously by the hydrographic department of556 SCIENCE N S VoL XXIII No 588 the British Admiralty The new pamphlet contains charts which show the variations the position and the intensity of the anticyclonic areas and their relation to the doldrums the distribution of gales fog etc Gales reach the South Atlantic by crossing the southern part of South America or by rounding Cape Horn to the eastward Fogs are rarely found north of the thirtieth parallel except near the land on either side of the ocean but it is increasingly frequent in higher latitudes Nature January 11 1906 METEOROLOGICAL SERVICES IN SOUTH AMERICA TIHE latest information regarding meteor ology in South America may be found in the Monthly Weather Review for September 1905 Previous accounts of the South American meteorological services are those of A Law

CRANBERRIES FROM FROST A CRANBERRY grower at Cameron Wis Mr A C Bennett protects his cranberries against frost in the following way The marsh is surrounded by banks twentyfive to thirtyfive feet high with sloping sides The principal reservoir is northwest of the planta tion and a trout stream is diverted around and outside of the marsh forming a succes sion of reservoirs entirely surrounding the latter from five to thirty rods wide As the cold air descends from the high surrounding banks it must cross these reservoirs of water and pass over the dams before it can reach the vinesMo Wea Rev Oct 1905 NOTES PROMPTED  by what has been urged against it by English physicists and others and by the inconclusive nature of the supposed re sults obtained by those who approve of it J R Sutton of Kimberley South Africa has devoted some time to the black bulb thermometer in vacuo His results have been published in Trans So Afr Philos Soc XVI Part 2 Oct 1905 THE typhoon of June 30 and July 1 1905 is discussed in the Bulletin of the Philippine Weather Bureau for July lately received Curves showing the barometer readings at Aparri and at Santo Domingo the latter a barograph curve are given Students of tropical cyclones will find the frequent discus sions of individual typhoons which are pub lished in these Bulletins of great interest ANOTHER account of a tropical cyclone is a very much belated one of the West Indian hurricane of August 11 1903 by Maxwell Hall in the Monthly Wecat her Review for September 1905 Several sets of barometer readings during the passage are given THE rapid progress which is being made in the exploration of the free air is evidenced by the fact that the British Weekcly Weather Report for January 6 contains for the first time observations made during kite ascents during the first week in January R DE C WARD

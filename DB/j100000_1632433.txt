science have published a monograph of seventyseven pages  En qute Scientifique sur les Vg6tariens de Bruxelles 1 In this monograph the question of vegetarianism is studied by several methods The authors have become convinced that the vegetarian regime is for the most part a more rational one than the highly nitrogenous diet ordinarily prevailing in Western Europe and America In the brief introduction general considera tions in regard to diet are mentioned and special emphasis given to the subject of toxins The authors quote in behalf of their conclu sions the eminent French dietitian Armand Gautier  who without himself being a vege tarian praises the good effects of the vege tarian r6gime The authors quote Gautier as follows The vegetarian r6gime modified by the addition of milk of fat of butter of eggs has great ad vantages It adds to the alkalinity of the blood accelerates oxidation diminishes organic wastes and toxins it exposes one much less than the ordinary r6gime to skin maladies to arthritis to congestions of internal organs This r6gime tends to make us pacific beings and not aggressive and violent It is practical and rational The authors while apparently classifying themselves as advocates of vegetarianism admit that in certain cases it is necessary to prescribe meat as a  medicament  just as one prescribes sometimes alcohol and other poisons The authors also observe that the transition to a vegetarian diet should be gradual The personal history is traced of fortythree vegetarians of Brussels Among other inter esting observations is the following For the most part the vegetarians appear younger than their age notably the ladies are distinguished by their clear and fresh complexion The experiments conducted by Mlles Ioteyko and Kipiani are restricted to vege tarians who have been such for several years The experiments were for the most part com parisons of strength and endurance So far as strength is concerned very little difference was discovered between vegetarians and carnivores In endurance on the other hand a very remarkable difference was found the vegetarians surpassing the carnivores from 50 to 200 per cent according to the method of measurement This result agrees with the experiment on nine Yale students described in SCIENCE2 These subjects by dint of thorough mastica tion gradually lost their taste for flesh foods At the end of five months while not becoming vegetarians they had reduced their consump tion of flesh foods to one sixth of the amount to which they had originally been accustomed Their strength remained practically stationary but their endurance according to the gym nasium tests was increased on an average by over 90 per cent The method of measuring endurance used by the Belgian investigators was by means of the Mosso ergograph One of the fingers is used to raise a weight as far as possible As the experiment proceeds and fatigue sets in the height to which the weight can be raised is gradually reduced until no further contrac tions are possible If a curve be constructed representing the height of the successive con tractions it is called a  curve offatigue and it is found that this curve is different for different individuals but is constant for the same individual from one day to another and even after an interval of several years if the 1 Brussels Henry

women with that of twentyfive carnivores students of the University of Brussels Com parisons for the right hand differed somewhat from those for the left the superiority of the vegetarians being greater for the latter than for the former Comparing the two sets of subjects on the basis of mechanical work it is found that the vegetarians surpassed the carnivores on the average by 53 per cent Comparing the two groups on the basis of the number oC contractionsor what amounts to the same thing the length of time during which the ergograph could be continuously operatedit was found that the vegetarians could work on the ergograph two or three times as long as the carnivores before reaching the exhaustion point This last result corresponds to conclusions of the present writer in an experiment in which fortynine subjects about half of whom were flesheaters and half fleshabstainers werecompared It was found that the flesh abstainers had more endurance as measured by gymnasium tests than the flesheaters to the extent of from two to three fold The Brussels investigators found also that the vegetarians recuperated from fatigue far more quickly than the meateaters a result also found in the Yale experiment An interesting mathematical study of the fatigue curve is made in which the equation H Hat  bt2ct is used In this equation n represents the height of the contraction at any time t repre sents time and H a b c are constants H is the height of initial or maximum contraction The authors believe that a is a parameter meas uring the toxicity of albumenoids in their effect on the muscles The numerical value of a is very small but as it is a coefficient of the cube of the time during which the experiment is continued the cumulative effects of these toxins is very ranid The parameter b is believed to refer to the excitability of the central nervous system and c to the utilization of carbo hydrates The authors refer to previous memoirs of J Ioteyko to justify these interpre tations of the coefficients After laborious computations it is found that the average of the coefficient a for the carnivores is 00305 and for the vegetarians 00015 The average coefficient b for the carnivores is 086 and for the vegetarians 023 The average coefficient c for the carnivores is 194 and for the vege tarians 146 The average of the constant H of the carnivores was 387 and for the vege tarians 317 The authors conclude by advocating a vege tarian regime as a proper system for working men and believe that its use would reduce the accidents on railways and in industry which come from overfatigue increase the produc tivity of labor as well as have other economic benefits The monograph of Mlles Ioteyko and Kipiani is especially interesting as confirming the trend of many modern studies It agrees in substance with the conclusions in a popular book published a year ago in England by T Russell on Diet and Strength The phi losophy however by which these harmonious results are explained by various investigators is not the same Russell and Illes Ioteyko and Kipiani regard the inferior endurance of meateaters as due to specific toxins in flesh foods and therefore are avowed vegetarians Under Professor Chittendens theory on the other hand the facts brought forward by Mlles Ioteyko and Kipiani as well as by Mr Russell and the writer would be interpreted as primarily due to the superiority of low proteid  rather than of a nonflesh diet For this and other reasons Professor Chittenden and most other modern physiologists avoid the term vegetarian as inappropriate and mis leading A vegetarian may through a wrong selection of his food materials suffer from the evils of high proteid and a flesheater may if he consumes flesh sparingly have the advan tages of a lowproteid diet It is possible that flesheating as ordinarily practised is injurious both because of ex  C The Influence of Flesheating on Endurance Yale Medical Journal

nutritious and that investigation has shown them to be poisonous Recently Dr F B Turck has found4 that dogs mice and rats fed on meat extractives exhibit symptoms of poisoning and often die The poisonous effect is aggravated by intestinal bacteria which find in these ex tractives an excellent culture medium Dr Turck concludes 1 It is clearly evident from these experi ments which correspond to the investigations of others that the injurious effects of meat are not due so much to the muscle proteid myosin as to the extractives 2 That the injurious effects of the extractives are increased through the action of intestinal bacteria Dr Turck does not find any evidence that the extractives in small quantities are in jurious Dr Turek therefore concludes that the high liver  who uses much flesh and also an excess of starch and sugar is a  bad risk  for life insurance companies He recommends if meat is to be used that the extractives first be removed by special processes which he ex plains He finds that the remaining part of the meat is highly nutritious and an invalu able aid in many cases of weak stomachs iHe supplies much clinical evidence of the evils of ordinary meateating as well as of the benefits obtainable from extractfree meat These investigations with those of Combe of Lausanne Mletchnikoff and Tissier of Paris as well as Herter and others in the United States seem gradually to be demonstrating that the fancied strength from meat is like the fancied strength from alcohol an illusion The  beef and ale of England are largely sources of weakness not strength Whether in modera tion they are harmful may still be a matter of conjecture While the trend of recent experi ments is distinctly against the excessive use of flesh foods there are still needed many more experimentsmedical athletic and industrial before the economics of diet can be estab lished on a secure basis The experiment with a vegetarian or semivegetarian diet at the University of Chicago which Director Stagg is to make with the athletic teams will be watched with interest Mlles Ioteyko and Kipiani seem to place a larger reliance on the ergographic tests than most physiologists A thoroughly reliable method of measuring endurance seems still to be a desideratum IRVING FISHER 4  Effect on Longevity of High Living by Fenton B Turek MD The Medical Exaiminer and Practitioner Vol

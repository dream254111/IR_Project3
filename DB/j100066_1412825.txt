COMMUNICATIED BY EDMUND C SANFORD XXI A PRELIMINARY REPORT OF EXPERIMENTS ON TIME RELATIONS IN BINOCULAR VISION By TIMOTHY J STEVIENSON and E C SANFORD The stereoscope as ordinarily arranged presents at the same time to each eye an appropriate picture In a special form de vised by Prof Miinsterberg however the pictures are not pre sented simultaneously but each eye sees its own picture for an instant while the other eyes picture is covered2 Still earlier Dvordik showed that stereoscopic vision was possible under cir cumstances similar to these and described certain illusions de pending on that fact3 Dvorak and later Exner studied also the least time interval that could be observed between visual stimuli offered separately to the two eyes4 The study now to be described belongs to this general group but the particular questions with which it deals are slightly different from any of these The first problem undertaken was that of determining what time interval if any may be inserted between the pre sentation of each picture to its proper eye without marked in terference with the perception of stereoscopic relief and the preliminary results to be stated have to do chiefly with what is to be observed when the interval is made so long that stereo scopic vision becomes difficult or impossible The Apparatus The apparatus used was in general terms a Wheatstone stereoscope fitted with notched disks in such a way that one eyes picture was first exhibited automatically 1In view of the fact that Mr Stevenson is no longer working in the laboratory and that the problem is about to be taken up by other hands it has seemed best to make this report of results which seem to be demonstrated 2Miinsterberg Psy Rev I 1894 5660 Studies from the Har vard Psychological Laboratorya

equal to the exhibition of the first eyes picture The details of the arrangement will be made sufficiently clear by the accompany ing plates and plans F F i H 7D  tt18 fiG I I3I S M IiI FIG II Plate I shows the apparatus as viewed from in front Plate II the same viewed from the side Fig I is a front elevation of the apparatus and Fig II its ground plan A and A in Fig I are two plane mirrors each about an inch and onehalf in diameter fastened over corresponding holes in two upright132 STIEVENSON AND SANFORD panels B and B standing at right angles to each other Figs I and II In order to secure easy and perfect fixation the silvering of each mirror was removed from a little spot at the centre through which the observer looked at a white fixation point on the black background E which was itself carefully set so as to lie in a definite plane of the stereoscopic solid Into coincidence with the fixation point just mentioned were also brought certain symmetrical points of the reflected images of the diagrams carried by the panels D and Dusually the centre points of the larger circle or polygon The rotating disks used to secure the separate presentations of the diagrams are indicated by F and F Figs I and II These disks were I6 inches in diameter and stood 45 inches apart In the edge of each was cut a square notch 300 wide and 25 inches deep The disks were carried by a horizontal axis G lying parallel to a line joining the centres of rotation of the eyes of the observer and 65 inches behind the centre of the mirrors On this axis they were held by nuts which allowed them to be moved stiffly with reference to each other and made it possible to set the notches in them quickly at any angular distance from each other up to 1500 1800 minus 300 The precision of the setting of the disks was tested by means of a straight edge attached to the frame of the apparatus and a scale of degrees marked off on one of the disks The disks were rotated by an ordinary fanmotor actuated by the commercial alternating current of the city working through a series of pulleys to reduce the speed The final pulley upon the axis of the disks is shown at H in the figures This pulley was connected with the rest of the driving appa ratus by a loose belt running over an idle pulley serving also as a belt tightener By this means the disks could be stopped or started as often as necessary without interrupting the move ment of the rest of the driving apparatus The rate of such a motor is usually quite constant and in this case was tested be fore and after each experimental sitting except one by three timings of one hundred revolutions of the disks each taken with a stop watch reading to onefifth of a second1 The average rate found was slightly over 8o seconds per hundred turns The greatest variation found in any single group of three countings was 04 seconds and the extreme variation between timings taken in different days was 32 seconds More exactly the average time for one rotation of the disk was 0804 seconds 1 On one or two occasions during the experiments the motor clearly slowed up for a few seconds at a time because of a temporary inter ruption of the current or for some similar cause At such times ob servations were of course suspended until the normal speed was resumedBINOCULAR TIM1E RIELATIONS 133 and thus for one degree 2230 for IO 2230 for 200 450 for 300 670 for

simply alternated at in tervals of 3350 measured from the end of the period of visibility of one to the beginning of that of the next The exposure time for each picture was constant at 670 seconds 300 or in common fractions about i15 of a second One each of the three pairs of stereoscopic diagrams used is to be seen in Plate I The one in the holder at the left and the right hand one of those in front of the instrument desig nated in the notes as Diagrams 13 and 15 are familiar forms The inner and middle circle of Diagram 13 however were colored the inner one red the next violet while the outer most was black This difference in color was unnecessary and a disadvantage as it possibly tended to suggest monocular re lief in ways which would not have been present with figures all in black Diagram I5 was drawn entirely in black but was unsatisfactory for another reason its oblique lines intro duced definite tendencies to monocular relief according as one or another of them was fixated and these monocular tendencies sometimes cooperated with and sometimes opposed the binocu lar relief The other figure known in the notes as Diagram 14 and shown in Figure III is a less common one copied from FIG III a collection of figures belonging to the Clark Laboratory To those unfamiliar with it this figure does not usually sug gest when uncombined the form brought out by combination When examined stereoscopically the diagrams show two dia mond shaped planes intersecting at an angle of nearly 9go Reversal of any of these diagrams in the holders of course134 STEVZNSON AND SANFORD brings about reversal in the apparent relief It was easy therefore with a little care to begin a test without the observ ers knowing what kind of relief he was to expect and this was the usual procedure Of the large disks three sorts were used one of black card board one of white the back of the black disks in this case which gave a fair but not exceptionally intense white and one of a medium gray These differences in brightness are by no means unimportant for the disks not only shut off the vision of the pictures after the required interval of exposure but the light which they reflect furnishes a general stimulation of the retina which has a profound effect upon the duration of the afterimages of the diagrams The illumination was ordi nary daylight and on several of the days when it was neces sary to experiment varied considerably Method The experimental procedure in the case of the more systematic experiments was as follows A pair of the diagrams was adjusted in the holders and covered up to prevent the ob server from knowing what form of relief to expect The disks were then set with their notches at a considerable angular dis tance usually 600 though sometimes 900go or 1500 was chosen and put in motion The observer took his place at the instru ment looked at the background and reported what he was able to observe The experimenter meanwhile recorded the ob servations asking questions when necessary to make the record definite The observer was allowed to adjust his head and to use his eyes in the way most convenient to him Occasional differences due to fixation and movement were reported After observations with a large interval the smaller were used in regular sequence 300 2o0 o00 oo and 300 The num bering of the scale of degrees was arranged to show the interval between the ending of the exhibition of the first picture and the beginning of that of the second Zero degrees therefore means that one exhibition began the instant the other ended and 300 means that the exhibition of both began at the same instantthat they were strictly simultaneous When observations had been made upon one pair of dia grams at the standard intervals another pair was substituted and the process repeated Similarly when all the diagrams had been worked through with one pair of disks another pair of disks was placed upon the axis and the observation of all the diagrams at all intervals was again undertaken The mat ters to which observation was especially directed were the na ture of the stereoscopic relief the apparent movement of the figures and the character of the afterimages Of the two chief observers one S has had quite a little experience with work of this kind The other T has hadBINOCULAR TIME RELATIONS 135 only a small amount of general training in the psychological laboratory A third observer P was like the first experi enced in psychological experimentation The note books con tain one full set of observations for S and T with all the disks and all the diagrams besides the records of some incidental testing taken while the apparatus was being perfected and at odd times during the taking of the regular set For P the records were taken with all the diagrams but part with the gray and part with the white disks Results The small number of systematic experiments and the complexity of the phenomena involved preclude our mak ing any quantitative answer to our first problem except a neg ative one It is qualitative statements chiefly that we can make and these for the most part with reference to what hap pens when the interval between the exhibitions of the two pictures is so long as to make stereoscopic vision difficult or impossible Our experiments have led us however to the conviction that practically no interval whatever can be inserted between the periods of excitation of the two retinas including the duration of the afterimage as a part of the first excitation without de struction of the stereoscopic relief It seems likely on the contrary that stereoscopic vision depends strictly upon the simultaneous excitation of the two halves of the visual appa ratus1 Further systematic experimentation on this point may show that a very minute interval can be inserted but it will certainly prove small even in comparison with the duration of the positive afterimage Upon the following points however our observations have been so uniform and consistent that we feel justified in making a definite report with regard to them i When the interval between the pictures is great enough to interfere with the usual stereoscopic apprehension of the diagrams their parts are apperceived as in motion They seem to change quickly from the position they occupy in one eyes diagram to that which they occupy in the other This is es pecially true of the parts that fall upon noncorresponding reti nal points but it is also true to a certain extent of the parts that fall upon corresponding points perhaps as a result of the relative way in which movement is usually perceived Double images in the ordinary sense are not seen at such times and in deed cannot be seen until the periods of retinal excitation over lap and are thus in part at least simultaneous For Diagrams 13 and 15 this movement was chiefly a change IIn Prof Miinsterbergs instrument the positive afterimages prob ably outlasted the entire interval136 STEVENSON AND SANFORD of place a sudden sliding or leaping from side to side of the in ner parts of the figure the diagrams having been so adjusted as to bring the outer parts approximately upon corresponding points This movement was not always strictly horizontal but at times in an oblique direction though there was nothing in the position of the diagrams or the observer that would easily suggest a reason In Diagram 14 the movement was an ap parent change in the shape of the figure itself diamond to square or vice versa This movement of the parts of the dia gram was most striking with the longer intervals and gradu ally decreased as the intervals were taken shorter and shorter until it finally disappeared when the setting reached oo or 300 In some cases the movement was apperceived as an excentric rotation in the plane of the background instead of a leaping from side to side and in a few cases when the inter val was short the movement seemed to be to and from the ob server in the third dimension instead of simply from side to side In most cases however the movement and the binocular relief seemed reciprocal phenomena the one decreasing as the other increases When the conditions are not present for the adequate perception of relief the apperceptive process takes on automatically another form the perception of movement In rare cases they are partially combined 2 As the interval is shkotened and the conditions become more favorable to the apprehension of stereoscopic relief the relief seems not to come in suddenly in full amount but gradually Let us say for example that in Diagram 14 the relations are such that under the conditions of ordinary stereoscopy the right hand point of the inner diamond would appear two inches in front of the right hand point of the outer diamond Then with the gradually decreasing intervals of our experiment it would appear at first perhaps only half an inch in front and would gradually draw forward as the time between the pictures less ened until with the o0 or 30o settings it would be seen at full two inches in front A corresponding but opposite change in the amount of the relief was to be observed when the interval between presentations was gradually lengthened from simul taneity The gradual alteration of the amount of stereoscopic relief 1It may be noted also in passing that it was usually the advance of some part of the figure from the plane of the fixation point toward the observer that was first and most easily to be observed The location of the portions back of that plane seemed more difficult and was slower in coming to observation A similar relation was demonstra ted to one of us by Dr J Carleton Bell in the Wellesley Laboratory some weeks before our experiments began We note in passing this confirmation of a result already obtained by himBINOCULAR TIME RELATIONS 137 just mentioned seems to us of some theoretic interest and so far as it goes to furnish an argument in favor of the theory that the perception of stereoscopic relief is due to a reflex ten dency of the eyes to move so as to fixate the different portions of an object seen in relief a tendency not by any means per ceived as such but simply in its result the binocular relief and especially to support Wundts account of the nature of the complex local signs in binocular vision If the matter were a reflex one we might very well suppose that the degree of bi nocular central excitation and accordingly of the tendency to movement would be roughly proportional to the time during which a very brief stimulus was operative binocularly and such a proportionality our experiments seem to indicate It may perhaps be suggested that this increase in stereoscopic relief with shortening time intervals was due not to the partic ular reflex relations above mentioned but to a general improve ment of the conditions necessary for an apperception of a third dimensional kind In other words that the relief seemed to grow greater as it actually grew clearer We are not inclined to think that this is the real explanation though of course the matter must await further explanation One other point has been emphasized in our own minds by these results and that is the rather misleading way in which binocular vision is often presented in the textbooks The sub ject is a complex one and much allowance is to be made but still it is customary to talk of binocular vision as though it were due to an actual psychophysical fusion of two simultane ously present but independent monocular images whereas it certainly should be regarded as the physiological result of a certain balance or distribution of excitations in a symmetrically constructed but unitary visual apparatus

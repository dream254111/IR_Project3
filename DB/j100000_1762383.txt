j100000,Science,1762383,To Keep WaterMounts Moist,i300555,170 SCII appears to me absolutely groundless The only velocity that can possibly remain constant or approximately constant during wheel ing is the velocity with reference to the supporting medium and as that velocity is according to his previous assumption not only small but negative there is no energy available to enable the bird to rise Indeed the bird in passing from a negative velocity rela tive to the air to a positive velocity relative to the air must pass through the phase of no velocity relative to the air in which he is practically helpless being compelled to fall vertically in order to acquire sufficient speed to steer Like Mr Pickering Professor MacGregor treats the subject as though the earth influenced the motions of a bird on the wing by some other means than gravita tional attraction He apparently fails to perceive that if the body of air in which the bird moves has no internal motion its relation to his flight is precisely that of a calm Let me illustrate A steamer propelled with uniform force on a calm ocean has its rudder turned constantly and by the same amount to the right and consequently describes a circle This circle is described on the ocean  it expresses a relation between the moving body and that by which it is supported It has no refer ence to the bottom of the ocean It makes no difference whether that part of the ocean is at rest or is part of a swift current The relation of the boat to the water is not affected by the relative mo tion of water and bottom Or consider a skater Having acquired momentum he is able to describe circles without propulsive effort until the storedup energy is consumed by friction and by the re sistance of the air The ice on which he circles may be frozen to the shores of a pond or it may float with uniform speed on a rapid river but his relation to the ice is the same in either case and his circles have the same pattern as engraved on the ice The case of the soaring bird is closely analogous His horizontal motions are related only to the air in which he moves and by which he is supported and they are not affected by the uniform horizontal mo tion of that air with reference to the ground A slight correction and I have done I assume as Professor MacGregor says that after wheeling the birds velocity relative to the medium in which he turns will be the same as before discount ing friction but I do not admit the implication that during the turn his velocity relative to the earth will change by an amount equal to twice the velocity relative to the earth of the medium in which the turn is made His velocity relative to the earth will change by an amount equal to twice his velocity relative to the medium G K GILBERT Washington DC Feb 25 IN two communications published in the last number of Science p 151 under the above title Professor Pickering and Professor MacGregor have developed with considerable ingenuity a theory of the possibility of a bird soaring in a uniform horizontal wind but it is certainly true that a bird cannot soar  that is perma nently sustain or elevate itself without expending energyin such a wind and it has therefore seemed to me to be important in the interests of clear thinking to show on dynamical grounds why soaring is impossible in this case Evidently the velocity of the wind relative to the earth has nothing to do with the question as it is the relative movement of wind and bird that causes the reactions between them and there fore can alone come into consideration Let the air therefore be supposed to be at rest relative to the earth and it becomes at once obvious that the bird cannot soar for suppose the bird to have any imaginable initial velocity and to wheel in the most artful manner it is still a mass falling under the influence of gravity and only resisted more or less by the fluid friction of the medium in which it is placed This fluid friction of the air against its wings can only delay its fall but can never prevent it just as it delays the fall of a feather A theory of soaring must explain how energy is given to the bird by the wind but it is clear that instead of the bird receiving energy it is expending either its kinetic energy as when in one of its whirls it sweeps upwards or potential energy when it sweeps downwards But the temporary increase of potential energy in a rise can never equal the corresponding loss of kinetic energy be cause energy is being continually expended in frictional heating There is thus a steady expenditure of energy and none received N NCE VOL XIII No 317 from the medium and the bird is therefore bound to come to the ground The only effect of the medium is to resist the mnotion in whatever direction it may take place whether up or down As soon as it is clearly seen that the only thing we are concerned with is the relative motion of air and bird and that the air may be at rest relative to the earth without affecting the question in the slightest the futility of any attempts to explain soaring in a uniform horizontal wind is apparent If any one wishes to discover the particular fallacies in the theories above mentioned let him attempt to follow out the reasoning as given in the communications referred to assuming however that there is no wind that the air is at rest relative to the earth re membering that the mere fact of the earths moving relative to the wind has no connection with the relation between the bird and the air The theory that soaring can be kept up by taking advantage of differentially moving layers of air is not open to the above criticism and may be the true explanation it is certainly not unreasonable on its face ARTHUR L KIMBALL Johns Hopkins University Baltimore Feb 23 To keep WaterMounts Moist IN biological work with the microscope it is frequently desirable to preserve watermounts for several days that growth develop ment etc may be observed from time to time Water lost by evaporation can be very successfully replaced to the glass slips from a beaker beneath by means of capillary tubes To make these hardglass tubing of about three millimetres bore is softened in a Bunsen flame and then drawn out to a diameter of from two tenths to threetenths of a millimetre This is then divided up into lengths of five centimetres and each piece bent at an angle of about 80 one centimetre from an end by holding it over a very small flame for an instant when of its own weight the end falls to the proper angle One tube is sufficient for a slip and is applied by first touching the longer limb in water when instantly the liquid will rise and fill the tube which may now be suspended by the shorter portion from the glass slip allowing one end to just touch the edge of the coverglass and the other to dip beneath the surface of the water in the beaker A thin film of water will run along the shorter limb and hold it securely in place The whole is then covered with a suitable belljar In this way mountings in water or nourishing solutions may be kept an indefinite time and are always ready for examination without disturbing them in the least Should it be desired to supply more fresh water or nourish ing solution to the mount than would ordinarily arise a bit of filter paper applied to the side of the coverglass opposite the capillary tube will accomplish this E B KNERR Parsons College Fairfield lo Feb i8 ColorBlindness a Product of Civilization THE following is a summary of a paper read before the Kansas Academy of Science at Leavenworth Nov i I888  The fact that blindness to certain colors exists among civilized people is well established also the percentage of cases to be found among males has been determined with considerable probability for the races of Europe and America There has been much di versity in methods of testing and the results of many reported de terminations might well be called into question Still it is prob ably not far from the truth that about four out of every hundred males are more or less deficient in colorsense Of females there have been reported B J JEFFRIES MD ColorBlindness p 74 as examined in Europe and America 39828 and of these only 60 were colorblind or 2 per cent Of both males and females 156732 have been tested and of these 6721 or 427 per cent are colorblind These statistical facts have naturally excited interest and discussion If so large a number as four out of every hundred are unable to distinguish colors there arises of course a practical question important to the railroads marine etc The gravity of this fact is already recognized more or less in all countries by the test examinations for colorblindness among employees But there is in these statistics also much of interest to scientists  II A

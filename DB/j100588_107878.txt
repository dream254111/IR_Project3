J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107878,ON THE DIFFERENCE OF MERIDIANS OF THE ROYAL OBSERVATORIES OF GREENWICH AND PARIS,I206982,C 286 J XIX ON THE DIFERENCE OF MERIDIANS OF THE ROYAL OBSERVATORIES OF GREENWICH AND PARIS BY THOMAS HENDERSON ESQ COMMUNICATED BY J F W HERSCHEL ESQ SEC R S READ MAY 17 1827 IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS FOR 1826 PART II MR HERSCHEL HAS GIVEN A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF OBSERVATIONS WHICH WERE MADE IN THE MONTH OF JULY 1825 FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASCERTAINING THE DIFFERENCE OF THE MERIDIANS OF THE ROYAL OBSERVATORIES OF GREENWICH AND PARIS WITH A COMPUTATION OF THESE OBSERVATIONS FROM WHICH THE MOST PROBABLE VALUE OF THE DIFFERENCE OF LONGITUDE APPEARS TO BE R 21 6 BUT I HAVE PERCEIVED THAT IN THE COPY OF THE OBSERVATIONS DELIVERED TO HIM FROM THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY OF GREENWICH AN ERROR OF ONE SECOND HAS BEEN COMMITTED AS THE TRUE SIDEREAL TIME OF THE OBSERVATION MADE THERE ON 9IST JULY OUGHT TO BE Y17 G38 5 7R1 IN PLACE OF X7H S8M 5G6IO SET DOWN IN THE TABLE P 104 WHICH HE INFORMS ME WAS COMPUTED AT THE OBSERVATORY AND OFFICIALLY COMMUNICATED TO HIM FROM THE ASTRONOMER ROYAL THIS ERROR SEEMS TO HAVE HAD ITS ORIGIN IN THE LITTLE TABLE AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE 1OS FOR ON SUB TRACTING THE ERROR OF THE CLOCK 4737 FROM THE TIME I8I 8M SO30 THE TRUE SIDEREAL TIME IS 18H 7M 43803 INSTEAD OF 18H 7M 4203 THERE GIVEN THE ERROR IN THE RESULT OF THAT DAYS OBSERVATIONS ARISING FROM THIS CAUSE HAS BEEN PARTLY COMPENSATED BY A MISTAKE OF THREE TENTHS OF A SECOND WHICHMR HENDERSON ON THE DIFFERENCE OF MERIDIANS C 287 HAS OCCURRED IN CALCULATING THE COMBINED OBSERVATIONS OF THE SAME DAY THE GAIN OF MEAN ON SIDEREAL TIME BEING STATED TO BE  4S54 PP 120 AND 122 IN PLACE OF 4S24 ON CHECKING THE OTHER OBSERVATIONS A FEW TRIFLING ALTERATIONS APPEAR TO BE NECESSARY UPON THE GREENWICH TABLE OF SIDE REAL TIME FROM THE DATA GIVEN ALONG WITH IT THESE SEEM TO BE OCCASIONED BY DIFFERENT METHODS OF CALCULATION AND INDEED ARE HARDLY WORTHY OF NOTICE THE FRENCH ASTRONO MERS NOT HAVING GIVEN THE DATA ON WHICH THE CALCULATIONS OF THE SIDEREAL TIMES AT PARIS ARE FOUNDED THEY ARE ASSUMED TO BE CORRECT THE EFFECT OF THE ALTERATIONS THUS MADE UPON THE ELEMENTS OF COMPUTATION IS TO REDEEM THE RESULT OF THE OBSERVATIONS OF 2 ST JULY FROM THE SUSPICION WHICH ATTACHED TO IT IN CON SEQUENCE OF ITS DISAGREEMENT WITH THE RESULTS OF THE OTHER DAYS AND TO PRODUCE A CHANGE OF ONETENTH OF A SECOND CORRESPOND ING TO ONE HUNDRED FEET NEARLY ON THE EARTHS SURFACE UPON THE MOST PROBABLE VALUE OF THE DIFFERENCE OF MERIDIANS FORMING THE SUBJECT OF INVESTIGATION IT NOW APPEARING TO BE 9L 2 1S AT THE SAME TIME THE CHRONOMETER WHICH WAS EMPLOYED FOR THE OBSERVATIONS AT FAIRLIGHT DOWN IS SHOWN TO HAVE KEPT A MORE UNIFORM RATE THAN WHAT PREVIOUSLY APPEARED IN THIS IMPORTANT NATIONAL OPERATION THE UTMOST ACCURACY IS DESIRA BLE AND IT HAS THEREFORE BEEN THOUGHT PROPER TO SUBJECT THE WHOLE OBSERVATIONS TO A NEW COMPUTATION THIS WILL MAKE MORE APPARENT THE NEAR COINCIDENCE OF THE RESULTS OF THE DIFFERENT DAYS OBSERVATIONS AND THE GREAT PRECISION TO BE EXPECTED FROM EXPERIMENTS OF THE NATURE OF THOSE IN QUES TION WHEN AS HAS HAPPENED IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE THEY ARE288 MR HENDERSON ON THE DFFERENCE OF MERIDIANS MADE WITH THE UTMOST CARE AND ATTENTION ON THE PART OF THE OBSERVERS THE DETAILS OF THE NEW COMPUTATION ARE

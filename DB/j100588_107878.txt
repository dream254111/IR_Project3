Meridians of the Royal Observatories of Greenwich and Paris By THOMAS HENDERSON Esq Communicated by J F W HERSCHEL Esq Sec R S Read May 17 1827 IN the Philosophical Transactions for 1826 Part II Mr HERSCHEL has given a detailed account of observations which were made in the month of July 1825 for the purpose of ascertaining the difference of the meridians of the Royal Observatories of Greenwich and Paris with a computation of these observations from which the most probable value of the difference of longitude appears to be r 21 6 But I have perceived that in the copy of the observations delivered to him from the Royal Observatory of Greenwich an error of one second has been committed as the true sidereal time of the observation made there on 9ist July ought to be Y17 g38 5 7r1 in place of x7h s8m 5G6io set down in the Table p 104 which he informs me was computed at the Observatory and officially communicated to him from the Astronomer Royal This error seems to have had its origin in the little Table at the bottom of page 1os for on sub tracting the error of the clock 4737 from the time i8I 8m so30 the true sidereal time is 18h 7m 43803 instead of 18h 7m 4203 there given The error in the result of that days observations arising from this cause has been partly compensated by a mistake of three tenths of a second whichMr HENDERSON on the difference of meridians c 287 has occurred in calculating the combined observations of the same day the gain of mean on sidereal time being stated to be  4s54 pp 120 and 122 in place of 4S24 On checking the other observations a few trifling alterations appear to be necessary upon the Greenwich Table of side real time from the data given along with it These seem to be occasioned by different methods of calculation and indeed are hardly worthy of notice The French astrono mers not having given the data on which the calculations of the sidereal times at Paris are founded they are assumed to be correct The effect of the alterations thus made upon the elements of computation is to redeem the result of the observations of 2 st July from the suspicion which attached to it in con sequence of its disagreement with the results of the other days and to produce a change of onetenth of a second correspond ing to one hundred feet nearly on the earths surface upon the most probable value of the difference of meridians forming the subject of investigation it now appearing to be 9l 2 1s At the same time the chronometer which was employed for the observations at Fairlight down is shown to have kept a more uniform rate than what previously appeared In this important national operation the utmost accuracy is desira ble and it has therefore been thought proper to subject the whole observations to a new computation This will make more apparent the near coincidence of the results of the different days observations and the great precision to be expected from experiments of the nature of those in ques tion when as has happened in the present instance they are288 Mr HENDERSON on the dfference of meridians made with the utmost care and attention on the part of the observers The details of the new computation are as follows As mentioned by Mr HERSCHEL rockets were exploded at Wrotham which were observed at Greenwich and Fair light down at La Canche on the French Coast which were observed at Fairlight and Lignieres and at Mont Javoult which were observed at Lignieres and Paris Before the difference of meridians can be eliminated from the observations the rates of the chronometers employed at Lignieres and Fairlight must be ascertained Let P be the sidereal time at Paris L the corresponding time indicated by the chronometer at Lignieres these times being deter mined by simultaneous observations of signals P and L the same times for a subsequent night then PP L L is the retardation of the chronometer at Lignieres on sidereal time during the chronometer time LL 247 x P  P Li L  L  L   r is the rate of the chronometer or the equation to be added to 24 hours of chronometer time to obtain the corresponding interval of sidereal time and 1 L is the equation to be added to any portion of chro

to deduce the rate for reducing the obser vations there by interpolation from the two nearest rates supposing that each answers to the middle of its interval In this manner are obtained the following rates for the observa tions at Lignieres July i8th 4 s341  but as this differs considerably from the rate which the chronometer had on leaving Paris the rate a 238 derived from the observations of the i8th and i9th has been retained as being probably nearer the truth gtlh 4n 1 138 2 st 3 57G63 s2d 3 5749 The rate of the Fairlight chronometer being sufficiently uniform the mean of the whole s 56 51

the corresponding chronometer time at Lignieres L and F corresponding chronometer times at Lignieres and Fairlight and F chro nometer time at Fairlight and G the corresponding sidereal time at Greenwich the intervals of chronometer times L L and F F must be reduced to intervals of sidereal time 1  and f f by the formulae given above Then P 4   1  f f G difference of meridians required as is

mean 9m 21s45 may be assumed to be near the truth But it may not be improper to ascertain the most probable value and its probable error by the calculus of probabilities as practised by GAUss BEssEL c to serve as a rule for other investigations of a similar nature in which it may be more requisite Each nights result is liable to an error occasioned by the errors in the observed times of the signals and of the transits of stars whereby the clocks were compared with the heavens The probable error of a single observation of a signal and a transit appears from a consi derable number of observations to be one tenth of a second and this divided by the square root of the number of these phenomena observed at any station gives the probable error of the mean of the observed times at that station But the results are exposed to other causes of error such as the small deviations of the transit instruments from their meri dians the peculiar state of the eyes of the different observers atmospheric circumstances and various others which fluc tuate from night to night but may be supposed constant during the same night Each nights result is equally liable to these errors which have no tendelcy to be diminished by an increased number of observations upon that night The probable error of each result arising from this cause is assumed to be two tenths of a second and it is not likely to be more Errors in the comparison of the chronometers employed for the observations of signals at Greenwich and Paris with the transit clocks are also to be apprehended which errors at each observatory may be supposed to be one tenth of a second A probable error of one tenth of a secondin the reduction of the interval at Lignieres on the i8th ought also to be taken into account By the theory of probabilities the square of the probable error in the result of each nights observations is equal to the sum of the squares of the various errors which by their combination produce the error in the result and the weight to be attributed to each result is expressed by the reciprocal of the square of its probable error The computation of these quantities is exhibited in the annexed Table in which A denotes the difference of meridians obtained from each nights observations e its probable error and W its weight Day of Obser eW W vation x S S 3 8 S   S 8 00 001 001 00l 01 001 0 O0 8th 9 2 144  3

probable value of the difference of meridians in question that it is likely that this determination is within two tenths of a second of the truth and that additional observations even to a very consider able number would not materially diminish the small uncertainty that still exists96 Mr HENDERSON on the dfference of meridians c The above rectification of the observations made to ascer tain the difference of longitude between Paris and Greenwich not only adds greatly to the merit of the distinguished observers employed in the work but trebles the value of their results by narrowing the

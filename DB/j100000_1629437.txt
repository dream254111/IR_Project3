eighteen months Rice and fish are the staple articles of diet for most Filipinos and in the provinces of the Camarines there is little variation from these two Fishes of every size and many varieties are prepared in every conceivable form but the samples enclosed are unique in that they are found here and no where else    Many varieties of fish abound in the lake but by far the most numer ous are these minute specimens They are called in the native Bicol tongue sinarapan and when dried in the sun on a leaf are called badi They are caught by a large sheet of close web which is dipped under wherever a school congregates They are put into tightly woven baskets from which the water soon drains leaving a compact mass of fish They are not minnows or immature fish They are adults and attain no greater size The natives buy them eagerly and when the little fleet of fishermen return from their mornings quest and place their baskets upon the ground on the market place they are instantly sur rounded by a crowd of waiting children who armed with every sort of dish are anxious to take home the family meal They bring three or four potato tubers a handful or two of rice or a few copper pennies and in exchange re ceive about a pint of fish In the kitchen the fish are made up with peppers or other spiced herbs and they do not taste bad The soldiers have become quite fond of this food and liber ally patronize the little native restaurants where it is served H M SMITH WASHINGTON D C DINOSAURS IN TIIE FT PIERRE SHALES AND UNDERLYING BEDS IN MONTANA IN the summer of 1900 I made a collection of Dinosaur and Mosasaur remains from the Ft Pierre beds near Fish Creek in Sweet grass County in Mlontana I have not noticed any account of the collecting of Dinosaurs from this horizon The beds are composed of darkcolored shales with occasional very thin lenses or layers of sand Sometimes the shales have no 31 grit sometimes they contain much fine sand There are many brown or grayish rounded concretions or concretionary layers These concretions are often very hard In these are many of the fossils both vertebrate and in vertebrate The mollusca are principally the wellknown characteristic Ft Pierre forms such as Ammonites Baculites Scaphites Nautali and many smaller forms In this locality the weathered surface of the beds forms a rolling grassclad prairie with occasional ravines cutting into the soft shales The bones are sometimes found in these ravines and cut banks and sometimes among the grass roots some of the bones projecting above the short grass The harder sandstones in the formation above form a line of bluffs or rimrock which for many miles marks the southern boundary of the Ft Pierre shales There are also dark shales interbedded with these sandstones This formation contains leaf impressions and many fragments of Dinosaur bones but the fossils have not been studied and no characteristic ones were recognized Below the Ft Pierre shales are hard rather thinbedded sandstones withinterbedded shales Still lower are hard and soft sandstones the latter predominating These contain plant impressions fossil wood a few apparently freshwater or brackishwater shells and Turtle and Dinosaur bones The latter many of them were in a beautiful state of preservation but no nearly complete skeletons were found In these beds are bands of peculiar black or very dark hard nodules that look something like basalt These sometimes contain bones The Dinosaur remains are of the Claosaurus type From the Ft Pierre beds the greater part of the skeleton of one Dinosaur and a good num ber of bones of another were obtained besides he skull and other parts of Mosasaurs The more complete Dinosaur skeleton is in the museum of the University of Montana It un doubtedly is a Claosaurus The other portion of a skeleton is in my collection It is much smaller and was undoubtedly quadrupedal in gait The sacrum is nearly complete and is different from anything else that I have seen JANUARY 3 190232 SCIENCE It is composed of three ankylosed vertebrae It is interesting to find Dinosaurs in these marine beds The marine fossils are found mixed with the bones While digging out the skeleton of Claosaurus nearly a dozen Nautali were found among the bones As a rule when bones are found a good part of the skeleton is there or there is evidence that it has been Several skeletons had been found and the bones removed for curiosities before I had visited this region The first skeleton I saw was shown to me by a young man Mr Albert Silberling who lived on the ranch from which the others were dug I think that very few fossilhunters would have looked for Dinosaur bones here It seems that these deposits were made in a shallow inland sea or an estuary which at least during a part of the time was cut off from the ocean for in places there is considerable gypsum Perhaps we should hardly expect to find such large marine mollusca in such a place but they evidently are not far from where they died There is no evidence of strong tides and if the shells had been washed up by these or the winds they would be broken not complete as we find them As a rule land animals are not very perfectly preserved in marine deposits In unearthing these animals therefore the question is always arising How did these bones get here  Did these Dinosaurs that have been so modi fied evidently fitting them for life on land still retain their swimming habits but occa sionally suffer shipwreck and their carcasses sink to the bottom of the sea By some in vasion of the sea were they forced to stay and starve or swim for life which proved in some cases to be for death I have seen no indica tions that they were killed by violence or their carcasses destroyed by large carnivorous ani malsthough there has been a little disturbance of the bones Did they die on some mud flat or did their carcasses float down some slug gish stream and get stranded in shallow water or get waterlogged and sink in deeper water These are interesting questions but more thorough and careful investigation is needed to decide the matter with any degree of certainty N S VOL XV No 366 The University of Montana hopes before very long to publish a bulletin describing these beds and whatever is of interest in the collec tions obtained from them EARL DOUGLASS PRINCETON N J MAGMATIC DIFFERENTIATION OF ROCKS SINCE the time when the celebrated chemist Bunsen first elaborated his theory on the na ture of rock magmas the subject has been of great importance to the geologist If one were asked to name three of the grander ideas which mark the progress of geology during the cen tury just closed this conception of magmatic differentiation of rocks would certainly be one of them Of late years contributions to the sub ject have been numerous and important Sev eral of the most recent are especially note worthy In the reconsideration by H S Washing ton Bulletin Geological Society of America Volume XI of the Igneous Complex of Magnet Cove Arkansas made exceptionally interesting through the elaborate efforts of J Francis Williams are recorded some observa tions on magmatic differentiation that are of unusual significance at this time Contrary to previously expressed opinion the several types of deepseated rocks represented in the com plex are regarded as integral parts of one great mass and as contemporaneous in origin and therefore not due to successive intrusions Furthermore the structure of the whole mass is probably laccolithic in character A remarkable feature connected with the zonal distribution of the various rocktypes is the complete reversal of the order almost in variably found among large masses of cooled magmas Ordinarily the borders are basic and the central parts more acidic But in the Magnet Cove mass the heavy constituents are in the center and the lighter silica alumina and alkali components are on the edges No table instances of similar character are re ported from Norway Finland and Montana The exceptional character of the Magnet Cove mass appears to suggest unusual condi tions While the general subject of the causes of differentiation is not discussed at length a possible explanation for the Arkansas complex

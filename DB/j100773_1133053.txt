CHESTER G VERNIER AND ELMER A WILCox APPEAL AND ERROR Cadenhead v State Okla App 117 Pac 462 Acceptance of Parole Pend ing an appeal from a conviction the prisoner accepted a parole from the governor and consented to the conditions thereof Held his appeal should be dismissed ARRAIGNMENT People v Heath Colo 117 Pac 138 No Arraignment and No Plea The trial court arrested a judgment of conviction because the record did not show that the defendant had been arraigned or that he ever pleaded or was required to plead to the information The prosecution appealed Held the error in the proceedings was not cured by a statute providing that No motion in arrest of judgment or writ of error shall be sustained for any matter not affecting the real merits of the offense charged in such indictment as that statute related to the merits of the offense as charged and not to proceedings during the trial And it was not cured by a statute providing that No indict ment or information shall be deemed insufficient nor shall the trial judgment or other proceedings thereon be reversed or affected by any defect which does not tend to prejudice the substantial rights of the defendant on the merits as this seemed to refer to defects in the information and not to errors committed by the court during the trial CONSTITUTIONAL LAW State v Rogne Minn 132 N W 5 Selfincrimination Without the prisoners knowledge or consent the sheriff and county attorney took from his premises certain articles tending to show that he had committed a crime and these articles were put in evidence at his trial Held not a violation of his constitutional right as he was in no proper sense compelled to give evidence against himself CONFESSIONS State z Brown Dela 80 Atl 146 Voluntary Character Confessions obtained at a coroners inquest under oath while accused were in the custody of the sheriff having been taken from jail handcuffed to the scene of the murder where the inquest was held were involuntary and inadmissible CONTEMPT U S v Barrett I87 Fed 378 Jurisdiction to Punish Where after a trial of a case in a Federal Circuit Court and while the jury were considering their verdict two persons interested in the corporation defendant made an assault on the plaintiffs attorney on the street in full view of the jury room 595JUDICIAL DECISIONS ON CRIMINAL LAW the court under its general jurisdiction to see that counsel practicing before it are not interfered with had jurisdiction to punish such individuals for contempt In re Shay Cal II7 Pac 442 By Attorney An attorney wrote to his client falsely stating that the justices of the Supreme Court had stated their opin ions to him on the case which was to be heard before them The letter was subse quently published Held to be contempt of court as it tended to create the false impression that the members of the court were on terms of undue intimacy with powerful litigants and such an impression must tend greatly to impair the confidence of the people in the integrity of the court EMBEZZLEMENT State v Geyer N J 80 Atl 489 By Agent Under Crimes Act P L I898 p 844 sec 184 making it a misdemeanor for any agent intrusted with the collection or care of money to fraudulently take or convert the same or any part thereof to his own use an attorney employed by a wife to defend a divorce suit who made an agreement with the husband that if the husband would place in the attorneys hands a certain amount for purposes of settlement of the wifes claim for alimony and an additional amount for traveling expenses the attorney would visit the wife and settle with her for as little as possible and that he should as between him and the husband be entitled to retain whatever was left was guilty of embezzlement not only as to a portion of the amount which she agreed to take in settlement and which he refused to pay her except upon her giving a general release but also as to the difference between the amount for which she agreed to settle and the amount committed to him for purposes of settlement EVIDENCE State v Badnelley R I 79 Atl 834 Res Gestae In a prosecution for assault with intent to commit rape where the prosecutrix had made complaint in the house to members of the household as they came in soon after the offense her complaint to her husband made about one hour after the offense is ad missible as a part of the res gestae People v Barnovich Cal App 117 Pac 572 Corroboration of Accomplice The only proof that the prisoner was the person who blew up Hartmans house with dynamite aside from the testimony on one admitted and one disputed accomplice was evidence that the prisoners shoes fitted perfectly in footprints found near the premises where the explosion occurred that he had dynamite on his person shortly before and immediately after the explosion and that he had repeatedly threatened to fix Mr Hartman with dynamite Held while this evidence standing alone might have but slight weight in connecting the prisoner with the crime it did tend to do so and was sufficient corroboration of the testimony of the accomplices State v Mattivi Utah II7 Pac 31 Similar but Unconnected Facts Harm less Error On a prosecution for statutory rape the prosecutrix was permitted to testify over the prisoners objection that they occupied the same room for three nights following that on which the offense was committed The prisoner took the stand denied that he had promised marriage and testified that the prosecutrix had told him she was above the statutory age but did not deny the 596JUDICIAL DECISIONS ON CRIMINAL LAW fact of intercourse Held it was error to admit the evidence of separate and independent acts of intercourse occurring after the one complained of as tending to prove independent offenses That it was not admissible as corrobora tion since she could not corroborate her testimony as to one fact by testifying to a similar fact occurring at a different time If the prisoner had not taken the stand it might have been necessary to reverse the judgment for this error as then his failure to deny any fact however inculpatory could not be used against him But when he took the stand and denied her testimony as to the promise of marriage but failed to deny that as to the intercourse he in effect conceded the truth of the latter testimony As the only effect of the evidence improperly admitted was to tend to establish this conceded fact the error was without prejudice hence the conviction should be affirmed EXTRADITION Gluckman v Henkel U S Marshal for the Southern District of N Y 31 Sup Ct Reptr 704 Good faith to the demanding foreign government re quires the surrender of the accused in extradition proceedings if there is pre sented even in somewhat untechnical form such reasonable ground to suppose him guilty of crime as to make it proper that he should be tried The effect of a variance between the complaint and the evidence in pro ceedings for the extradition of a person to a foreign country is to be decided on general principles irrespective of the law of the state where the proceedings are had FOOD AND DRUG ACT CONSTRUED U S v Johnson 31 Sup Ct Reptr 627 Misbranding False and misleading statements in the labels on a proprietary medicine as to its curative or remedial effects but which do not import any statement concerning identity are not misbranding within the meaning of the Food and Drugs Act of June 30 I9o6 34 Stat at L 768 chap 3915 sec 8 which defines that term as applicable to all drugs or articles of food the package or label of which shall bear any statement design or device regarding such article or the ingredients or sub stances contained therein which shall be false or misleading in any particular HOMICIDE Commonwealth v Colandro Pa 80 Atl 57I Killing in Passion Though the sudden passion which will reduce the killing to manslaughter is usually anger yet it is not limited thereto but sudden terror rendering the mind incapable of cool reflection is sufficient Commonwealth v Phelps Mass 58 N E 868 If accused without warning an officer to desist from attempting to arrest him in cool blood and with express malice intentionally killed the officer accused is guilty of murder though the officer acted unlawfully in attempting to arrest without a warrant People v Cleminson Ill 95 N E I57 Harmless Error A conviction of murder will not be reversed for erroneous admission of evidence where guilt is shown beyond a reasonable doubt by competent evidence People v Gukouski Ill 95 N E I53 Responsibility for Acts Done in Furtherance of a Common Design Evidence that defendants conspired with one 597JUDICIAL DECISIONS ON CRIMINAL LAW K a codefendant to upset a bakery wagon belonging to a baker whose men were on strike and destroy the bread and that K was to attack the driver and that on the arrival of the wagon K shot and killed the driver sustained a conviction for murder defendants being liable for the acts of K done in further ance of the common object INDICTMENTGRAM MATICAL ERROR State v Hawkins N Car 71 S E 326 An indictment for burglary charged that the prisoner unlawfully wilfully and feloniously break and enter the town ball Held that as the meaning of the charge was clear the omission of the word did was a clerical or grammatical error and was cured by the statute INDICTMENT AND INFORMATION People v Payne I29 N Y Supp Ioo7 Error in Information An informa tion for violation of the motor vehicle law referring to a chapter of the laws by a wrong number does not entitle defendant to a dismissal where the name of the law and the date of its passage are stated State v Lamb N J 80 Atl III DuplicityAmendment An indictment charging in the same count two distinct offenses of which the mode of trial is the same and the punishment is the same in character even though it be differ ent in degree where the same defenses are open to the accused it is not neces sarily bad for duplicity and upon a motion to quash the state may be per mitted to strike out one of the charges if what is left suffices to charge a crime Dukes v State Ga 71 S E 921 Exceptions Must Be Negatived An indictment charged that the prisoner did unlawfully sell and furnish cocaine contrary to the laws of said state etc The statute excepted from penalty sales made on prescription Held the statement that the sale was unlawful was not a statement of fact but a conclusion of the pleader Hence the indictment was fatally defective because it did not expressly state that the sale was not on prescription nor so specifically state the facts as to show by impli cation that it was not Conviction reversed I NSTRUCTIONS State v Burke N J 79 Atl 882 Presumption of Innocence An instruc tion in a criminal trial that if the circumstances incident to the situation admit of drawing an inference excluding any notion but that of guilt it would be sufficient to maintain the contention of the state that the presumption of innocence has been overcome is erroneous State v Papa R I 80 Atl 12 Invading Province of Jury An instruction in a prosecution for assault with a dangerous weapon that the flight of accused after the assault made a prima facie case of guilt on his part if not explained is erroneous since under Const Art I Sec 14 giving the accused the pro tection of the principle that every person is presumed innocent until he is proven guilty and under Art I Sec Io declaring an accused shall not be deprived of life liberty or property unless by the judgment of his peers or the law of the land it is the province of the jury to determine the weight of this sort of evidence 598JUDICIAL DECISIONS ON CRIMINAL LAW JURY People ex rel Stabile v Warden of City Prison of City of New York N Y 95 N E 728 Power of Court to Discharge Code Cr Proc Sec 428 authorizing the court to discharge the jury before verdict when after the lapse of a reasonable time the jury shall declare themselves unable to agree does not permit a discharge before the jury has declared their inability to agree and where the jury in a murder case retired for deliberation at 515 oclock p m their discharge five hours later without any request from the jury and on the foremans statement in response to a query that the jury had not yet agreed on a verdict was unauthorized LARCENY State v Smith Nev II7 Pac I9 Consent of Owner Pursuant to a conspiracy to steal gold amalgam one conspirator tried to fix the watchman thought he had succeeded and told the conspirator who was to steal the amal gam that it would be safe to do so when the watchman said All right The watchman had reported the matter to a deputy sheriff who was an employe of the company that owned the amalgam and had been ordered to feign compliance for the purpose of detecting the conspirators but not to touch any of the amalgam himself nor consent to the stealing The watchman said All right but refused to suggest any mode or proceeding or to receive the amalgam and hide it for the thief He told the thief that the agreement was he was to have nothing to do only turn his back on the proceedings and that it was not safe for him to touch the amalgam as the watchmen were possibly watched There was no evidence that either the watchman or the deputy was authorized by the company to induce the prisoner to take the amalgam or to aid in its removal Held as the offense was planned by the prisoner and every act necessary to constitute grand larceny was done by his confederates without the taking of the amalgam being suggested or advised by the company or its agents and the deputy sheriff and watchman allowed the amalgam to be taken for the purpose of detecting crime and entrapping the perpetrators    but did not plan urge or advise its taking or handle it or assist in its removal the company had not so consented to the taking as to prevent the prisoner from being guilty of larceny MONOPOLIES U S v Patton I87 Fed 664 Cornering the Market Since the operation of a scheme to corner the cotton market and thereby raise the price of cotton for the purpose of compelling a settlement by short speculators at an abnormally high price does not directly affect or restrain interstate commerce there being no direct relation between prices and such commerce an indictment alleging a conspiracy to run a cotton corner without any alleged intent to ob struct interstate commerce did not charge a violation of Sherman AntiTrust Act July 2 I890 Ch 647 Secs I 2 26 Stat at L 209 RAPE People v Marks I30 N Y Supp 524 Female under Age of Consent Neither the consent nor the previous chastity of a girl nor her representations 599JUDICIAL DECISIONS ON CRIMINAL LAW nor information derived from others as to her age nor her appearance with respect to age is a defense to a prosecution for rape on a girl under statutory age of consent SENTENCE State v Durham S Car 71 S E 847 Erroneous Sentence When the trial court imposes a sentence not authorized by law a new trial will not be granted but the sentence will be set aside and the case remanded for a lawful sentence TRIAL State v Thorne Utah II7 Pac 58 Misconduct of Juror After a capital case had been submitted to the jury one of the jurors in violation of his instruc tions left the others and talked with someone over the telephone An officer was with him Held as all communication was forbidden and the juror was a wrongdoer in talking to anyone without permission of the court prejudice would be presumed and as the state had not shown the communication to be harmless the conviction should be reversed It was said that if communication had not been forbidden prejudice would not be presumed from an unexplained communication even though from the attending circumstances it were of doubtful propriety Dowdell v U S 31 Sup Ct Reptr 590 Confronting Witnesses The right of the accused under the Philippine Island Bill of Rights of July I I909 32 Stat at L 69I Chap 1369 Sec IO to meet the witnesses face to face was not infringed by the action of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands upon suggestion of diminution of the record in ordering the judge and clerk of the court below to supply the failure of the record to show whether the accused pleaded to the complaint and were present in court during the entire trial State v Thomas Ia 132 N W 51 Limiting Crossexaminations The limits to be placed upon the crossexamination of witnesses are so largely within the discretion of the trial court that a conviction will not be reversed unless it is shown that the rulings were arbitrary or unfair and resulted in prejudice to the defendant State v McKay S Car 71 S E 858 Ordering Witness Arrested for Perjury A witness for the prosecution having sworn that he knew nothing about the case and that the testimony he had given against the prisoner at the pre liminary examination was false the prosecuting attorney in open court ordered the sheriff to arrest him for perjury The defendant objected on the ground that it was calculated to intimidate other witnesses from varying from the testimony given at the preliminary examination Held there was no prejudice and the prompt action was commendable as tending to prevent miscarriages of justice State v Battey R I 80 Atl Io Waiver of Jury Const Art I Sec 15 declares that trial by jury shall remain inviolate but that it may be waived in civil cases Gen Laws 1909 Ch 296 Sec 9 provides that allcriminal appeals shall be tried in the Superior Court with a jury Held that accused on an appeal to the Superior Court cannot waive a jury trial 600JUDICIAL DECISIONS ON CRIMINAL LAWr People v Kinney N Y 95 N E 756 Misconduct of Trial Judge Where the trial judge in rulings on evidence in giving directions to counsel for ac cused and in charging the jury inadvertently and unintentionally did things which in the aggregate were calculated to create such a prevailing atmosphere of apparent prejudice to the accuseds cause that the jury could scarcely escape its substantial influence accused was entitled to a new trial regardless of the strength of the peoples case on the question of guilt or innocence People v Toledo I30 N Y Supp 440 During adjournment after the evidence had been all introduced one of the jurymen was seriously injured whereupon it was agreed between the assistant district attorney and the de fendants attorney that a juror should be deemed withdrawn that the trial so far as it had taken place should be declared a mistrial that the eleven jurors be resworn that a new juror be impaneled and sworn to take the place of the absent juror that the testimony theretofore taken be read to the entire jury and that both sides then sum up and the court charge the jury in the usual manner This practice was carried out and the defendant convicted Held that since all the jurors had not the benefit of the testimony as given by the witnesses the legality of the procedure was sufficiently doubtful to entitle ac cused to a certificate of reasonable doubt UNNECESSARY PARTICULARITYVARIANCE State v Kelly N Dak 132 N W 223 An information charged that the prisoner maintained a common nuisance for the sale of intoxicating liquors in a building situated in the city of Minot    in the county of Ward The proof was that the building was about one hundred yards outside the city limits Held that though the information would have been sufficient had it merely stated that the building was situated in the county the state having unnecessarily charged a more particular description the description as laid in the information must be proven and the trial court erred in not advising a verdict of acquittal WITHDRAWAL OF PLEA OF GUILTY People v Walker Ill 95 N E 475 Discretion It was an abuse of dis cretion not to vacate the judgment on a plea of guilty in a bigamy case and permit defendant to withdraw his plea of guilty and allow him to submit his case to the jury he making affidavit that he did so on the advice of counsel on the assurance of such counsel that he had arranged with the states counsel that the bigamy charge was to be dropped he having pleaded to the charge of adultery 6oi

ACCURACY BUT AT THE SAME TIME LEAVES UNTOUCHED THE NECESSITY FOR DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF THE CONDITION OF THIS PORTION OF THE BRAIN IN PARTICULAR SPECIES I ALSO THINK IT NOT IMPROBABLE THAT RENEWED INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE HUMAN BRAIN MAY NECESSITATE SOME MODIFICATION IN THE CONCLUSIONS CONTAINED IN THE LAST PARAGRAPH SOME OF THE SPECIAL MONOGRAPHS UPON THE BRAINS OF QUADRUMANA

BE BASED UPON AN APPEAL TO NATURE AND NOT TO AUTHORITY THEREFORE WITH A DESIRE TO CONTRIBUTE SOME RELIABLE DATA TO AN INTERESTING BRANCH OF ANATOMICAL SCIENCE I HAVE TAKEN THE OPPORTUNITY RECENTLY AFFORDED BY THE EXAMINATION OF THE BRAINS OF NUMEROUS EXAMPLES BELONGING TO THREE FAMILIES OF QUADRUMANA OF MAKING THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS THE GREATER NUMBER OF THE SPECIMENS DESCRIBED ARE FROM ANIMALS WHICH HAVE DIED DURING THE PAST SUMMER IN THE GARDENS OF THE ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY FOR THEIR TRANSMISSION INTO MY HANDS WHILE IN THAT PERFECTLY FRESH CONDITION SO ESSENTIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF CEREBRAL INVESTIGATIONS I AM INDEBTED TO THE ATTENTION OF MR BARTLETT THE ABLE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE SOCIETYS COLLECTION AS OTHER CONSIDERATIONS BESIDES THOSE OF A PURELY ANATOMICAL CHARACTER HAVE BEEN SUP POSED TO BE INVOLVED IN INQUIRIES OF THIS NATURE I MUST STATE AT THE OUTSET THAT THESE HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ANY THEORY AS TO THE TRANSMUTATION OF SPECIES OR ORIGIN OF THE HUMAN RACE WHATEVER INFERENCES OTHERS MAY DRAW FROM THE FACTS RELATED FOR MY OWN PART I SEE NO REASON TO ASSIGN ANY SPECIAL IMPORTANCE IN DETERMINING THE VALUE OF SUCH A THEORY TO THE CONDITION OF THE PARTICULAR PORTION OF THE CEREBRAL ORGANIZATION NOW UNDER CONSIDERATION ESPECIALLY AS THE GENERAL CLOSE RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURE OF MAN AND THE QUADRUMANA HAS LONG BEEN A MATTER OF

IT MUST BE OBSERVED THAT IN THE HUMAN BRAIN THERE IS SOME VARIATION IN THIS RESPECT BUT THE AVERAGE DEPTH OF THE CALCARINE FISSURE IS WELL ILLUSTRATED IN THIS EXAMPLE AS ALSO THE USUAL SIZE OF THE POSTERIOR CORNU THIS CAVITY APPEARS IN SECTION AS A MERE FISSURE CURVED ROUND A DELICATE STRATUM OF WHITE SUBSTANCE WHICH COVERS INTERNALLY THE GREY MATTER OF THE CALCARINE SULCUS AND WHICH CONSTITUTES THE VENTRICULAR SURFACE OF THE HIPPOCAMPUS MINOR IN SECTION C NO TRACE OF THE OPENING CAN BE DISCOVERED SUCH IS THE APPEARANCE PRESENTED BY THIS PORTION OF THE BRAIN IN THE HIGHEST STATE OF PERFECTION WHICH THAT ORGAN ATTAINS A CONDITION HOWEVER ALWAYS THE LEAST FAVOURABLE FOR STUDYING THE MORPHOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE AND TRUE RELATIONS OF ITS SEVERAL PARTS THE ORIGINAL DESIGN NOW OBSCURED BY SPECIAL ADAPTIVE MODIFICATIONS CAN ONLY BE TRACED EITHER BY OBSERVING THE GRADUAL EVOLUTION OF THE SAME PARTS FROM THEIR MOST RUDIMENTARY CONDITION OR BY A COMPARISON OF SIMILAR STRUCTURES IN OTHER ANIMALS OF SIMPLER ORGANIZA TION BY THE FIRST METHOD WE LEARN THAT WHILE THE HEMISPHERES OF THE BRAIN ARE MERE SACS AND PERFECTLY DEVOID OF CONVOLUTIONS THE CALCARINE IS ONE OF THE FIRST OF

KNOWN LITTLE PHYSIOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE CAN HOWEVER BE ATTACHED TO THE SIZE OF THE LATTER AS COMMONLY ESTIMATED BY THE PROJECTION INTO THE VENTRICLE THE REAL AMOUNT OF CORTICAL OR GANGLIONIC NEURINE SURROUNDING THE CALCARINE SULCUS CAN ONLY BE ASCERTAINED BY AN EXAMINATION OF THE LENGTH DEPTH AND COMPLEXITY OF THAT SULCUS AND REMAINS UNALTERED WHATEVER MAY BE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE CAVITY OF THE VENTRICLE IS CLOSED JUST AS THE SIZE AND FORM OF THE CORPUS STRIATUM WOULD BE UNAFFECTED BY THE ABSENCE OR CLOSURE OF THE PORTION OF THE LATERAL VENTRICLE WHICH LIES IN CONTACT WITH IT SUCH AN EXAMINATION BOTH IN DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS OF THE HUMAN RACE AND IN THE BRAINS OF VARIOUS ANIMALS MAY SUPPLY IMPORTANT DATA IN FUTURE INVESTIGATIONS CONCERNING THE FUNCTIONS OF SPECIAL PORTIONS OF THE GREY MATTER ON THE SURFACE OF THE CEREBRUM  MANY OF THE VARIATIONS IN THE CONDITION OF THESE PARTS MUST BE ASCRIBED RATHER TO PATHOLOGICAL CHANGES THAN TO ORIGINAL CONFORMATION THUS IN AGED AND DEBILITATED SUBJECTS THE POSTERIOR CORNU IS OFTEN ENLARGED AND SOMEWHAT FUNNELSHAPED THE CALCARINE PROJECTION BEING ALSO MORE OR LESS OBLITERATED A CIRCUMSTANCE ARISING APPARENTLY FROM GRAVITATION OF

BACK WARDS AS COMPLETELY TO COVER THE CEREBELLUM BUT NOT TO EXTEND BEYOND IT BUT AN EXAMINATION OF THE INTERIOR OF THE CRANIUM FROM WHICH THE BRAIN WAS TAKEN SHOWS THAT THE SHRINKING OF THE HEMISPHERES HAS REDUCED THEIR DIMENSIONS IN THIS DIRECTIOIN IT IS THEREFORE PERFECTLY EVIDENT THAT THE POSTERIOR LOBES OF THE CEREBRUM ACCORDING TO ANY DEFINITION TAKEN FROM EXTERNAL CHARACTERS EXIST IN A VERY WELLDEVELOPED CONDITION ALTHOUGH NOT PROLONGED BACKWARDS TO QUITE SO GREAT AN EXTENT AS THEY USUALLY ARE IN THE HUMAN BRAIN TO EXAMINE THE INTERIOR THE UPPER PORTIONS OF THE HEMISPHERES WERE REMOVED TO THE LEVEL OF THE INFERIOR SURFACE OF THE CORPUS CALLOSUM AND THEN FURTHER PORTIONS WERE CARE FULLY DISSECTED AWAY SO AS TO EXPOSE THE LATERAL VENTRICLES WITH THEIR THREE CORNUA THE GENERAL

SECOND B IN MAN THE AVERAGE PROPORTION IN SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF A TO B IS AS 100 TO 53 IN THIS ORANGS BRAIN A MEASURES EXACTLY 2 INCHES AND B 1 INCH OR AS 100 TO 50 SO THAT THE POSTERIOR LOBE AS DEFINED BY INTERNAL STRUCTURE EXHIBITS THE SAME SLIGHT DIMINUTION UPON THAT OF THE HUMAN BRAIN AS WAS ALREADY ESTI MATED BY THE AMOUNT OF COVERING OF THE CEREBELLUM IT MUST BE REMEMBERED HOWEVER THAT THIS OBSERVATION IS TAKEN FROM A SPIRIT PREPARATION PRESBYTES LEUCOPRYMNNS OTTOAN ADULT FEMALE DIED IN THE ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETYS GAR DENS AUGUST 20 1861 AND THE BRAIN WAS EXAMINED WHILE IN A PERFECTLY FRESH

SCARCELY APPEARING ON THE SURFACE THE CALCARINE SULCUS DIFFERS FROM THAT NOT ONLY OF MAN BUT OF NEARLY ALL APES IN EXTENDING TO THE EXTREMITY OF THE LOBE AND EVEN TURNING ROUND TO THE OUTER SURFACE WITHOUT DIVIDING INTO BRANCHES THE THREE SECTIONS SHOW THAT THIS SULCUS PENETRATES MORE DEEPLY INTO THE SUBSTANCE OF THE HEMISPHERE THAN IN MAN BUT IT IS TOLERABLY SIMPLE IN ITS COURSE PASSING NEARLY DIRECTLY INWARDS THE POSTERIOR CORNU OF THE VENTRICLE IS DISTINCTLY OPEN TO WITHIN A VERY SHORT DISTANCE OF THE HINDER EXTREMITY OF THE LOBE AND IS OF CONSIDERABLE VERTICAL DEPTH BEING CURLED ROUND

SOMEWHAT BACKWARDS AND DOES NOT JOIN THE CALCARINE SULCUS BUT TERMINATES AT THE UPPER MARGIN OF A PROMINENT GYRUS THE SECOND INTERNAL ANNECTENT WHICH BORDERS THE LAST NAMED FISSURE SUPERIORLY THE SECTIONS SHOW THAT THE CALCARINE FISSURE EXTENDS TO A GREATER DEPTH THAN IN ANY OTHER GENUS YET EXAMINED AND HAS A SINGULAR COMPLEXITY OF FORM AS THERE IS CONCEALED WITHIN IT AND ATTACHED TO ITS FLOOR A SMALL BUT DISTINCT GYRUS PLATE II FIG 3 AND PLATE III FIG 7 26 THIS CONVOLUTION WHICH MAY BE CALLED FROM ITS POSITION CALCARINE COMMENCES ANTERIORLY BY A SLIGHT ELEVATION OF THE FLOOR OF THE CALCARINE FISSURE INCREASES AS IT PROCEEDS BACKWARDS AND COMES TO THE SURFACE WHERE THE SULCUS TURNS UP TOWARDS ITS TERMINATION THEN BOUNDED SUPERIORLY BY THE LOWER BRANCH OF THE SULCUS SWEEPS ROUND THE INFERIOR BORDER OF THE LOBE AND BECOMES CONTINUOUS WITH THE INFEROOCCIPITAL GYRUS OF THE OUTER SIDE IT APPEARS TO BE ALWAYS PRESENT IN CERCOPITLIECUS MICACUS AND CEBUSS AND PROBABLY IN ALL THE ALLIED GENERA BUT IS ABSENT IN THE HIGHEST AND LOWEST MEMBERS OF THE ORDER THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE DEPTH AND COMPLEXITY OF THE CALCARINE SULCUS IS THAT THE INVOLUTION OF GREY MATTER FORMING ITS WALLS IS MUCH INCREASED AND BEARS A VERY LARGE PROPORTION TO THE MASS OF THE LOBE AND THE CORNU OF THE VENTRICLE IS THROWN QUITE TO THE OUTER SIDE OF THE HEMISPHERE BEING AT ITS TERMINATION ONLY SEPARATED BY A THIN STRATUM OF WHITE MATTER FROM THE CORTICAL LAYER OF ITS EXTERNAL FACE THE WALLS OF THE CORNU ARE IN SUCH CLOSE APPOSITION THAT I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SATISFY MYSELF THAT IT IS IN THE ADULT CERCOPITIECUAS AN ACTUAL CAVITY IN THE SAME SENSE AS THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE VENTRICLE ESPECIALLY AS THE STAINING OF THE LINING MEMBRANE FOUND IN OTHER PARTS RARELY EXTENDS MORE THAN A QUARTER OF AN INCH UPON THE SURFACE OF THE HIPPOCAMPUS MINOR BUT AS FINE SECTIONS OF HARDENED BRAINS SHOW A LINE IN WHICH THE CEREBRAL SUBSTANCE IS ABSENT HAVING ALWAYS THE SAME DEFINITE EXTENT FORM AND DIRECTIONAS THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH WITH THE HANDLE OF THE SCALPEL WILL SEPARATE THE WALLSAS IN SOME GENERA IT IS UNDOUBTEDLY AS DISTINCTLY OPEN AS ANY OTHER PART OF THE CAVITY AND AS IT HAS BEEN SO CONSIDERED BY GRATIOLET HUXLEY AND OTHER COMPETENT OBSERVERS I HAVE NO HESITATION IN LOOKING UPON IT AS HOMOLOGOUS TO THE POSTERIOR CORNU 192OF THE CEREBRUM OF THE QUADRUMANA IN MAN WHETHER IT IS AN ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL CAVITY IS HOWEVER OF VERY LITTLE CON SEQUENCE AS THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION THAT THE PORTION OF THE BRAIN ANSWERING TO THAT WHICH IN MAN IS CALLED HIPPOCAMPUS MINOR ATTAINS IN CERCOPITHECUS A REALLY PRODIGIOUS DEVELOPMENT IN COMPARISON WITH THE SIZE OF THE CEREBRAL HEMISPHERE THE PROPORTIONATE LENGTH OF THE POSTERIOR LOBE AS MEASURED UPON A SECTION MADE WHILE THE BASE OF

THIS GENUS IS THE GREAT DEVELOPMENT OF THE OCCIPITAL LOBES IN A NEARLY FULLGROWN EXAMPLE OF C PORCARIUS I FIND THAT THEY PROJECT OTHS OF AN INCH BEYOND THE CEREBELLUM OR RATHER MORE THAN TH OF THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE HEMISPHERE PROPORTIONALLY MORE THEREFORE THAN IN MAN MEASURED INTERNALLY THE PROPORTION OF THE POSTERIOR TO THE ANTEROMEDIAN PORTION OF THE CEREBRUM IS AS 57 TO 100GREATER THAN IN

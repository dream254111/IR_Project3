his thought was to make specific gifts of the stock which he owned and this intent is not to be gathered alone from the item in which the gifts are made but gathered from the four corners of his will   After all how ever as has been said it is the intent of the testator that has to be found and in seeking it we are not confined to any particular word or phrase nor to any particular part of the will and the fact that the testator had the number of shares so given though not controlling is significant In Thayer v Paulding 200 Mass 98 it was said A very slight indication of an intention to give shares then in his ownership is enough to make the legacy specific in a case like this The Massachusetts Supreme Court in Trustees of the Unitarian Society in Harvard v Tufts 151 Mass 76 found nothing in Tifft v Porter supra inconsistent with the holding that a legacy of ten shares of the stock of the Worcester  Nashua Railroad Company was a specific legacy because the eighth clause of the will gave the balance of my stock as per my stock book my furniture and all other property not otherwise disposed of by me This language said Judge Holmes taken with the facts makes it pretty plain that the stock disposed of by the testatrix in the fourth clause was stock then belonging to her There is nothing in Brundage z Brundage 60 N Y 544 express ing a different view than that here stated As the number of shares bequeathed by James J Miller the de ceased was the same number which he owned at the time of mak ing his will what it has been asked would have happened in case he had owned at his death a less number In Drake Admr v True 72 N H 322 such a situation was met by dividing the stock left by the testatrix proportionately among the legatees These reasons supported by the above authorities lead to an af firmance of the order of the Appellate Division Intoxicating LiquorsStatutory ConstructionMaking for Per sonal Use as ManufacturingSection 36 art 1 of the Oregon Constitution and section 5 of Laws of Oregon 1915 p 151 forbid ding manufacture of liquor for beverage purposes are construed by the Supreme Court of that state in an opinion by Chief Justice Mc Bride in State v Marastoni 165 Pacific Reporter 1177 to apply to making wine for ones own use Portions of the opinion of the court are here given The principal question in this case is whether the defendant man ufactured the wine which he kept on the premises That he pressed the juice from the grapes put it in a vat and permitted it to fer ment by the usual natural process with the intenc to use part of it 53 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S in that state as a beverage for himself and family is admitted As to this portion of the liquid we are of the opinion that he is guilty of a violation of the statute Websters Dictionary defines the word manufacture to mean To make wares machinery or other prod ucts by hand by machinery or by other agency    We are of the opinion that the word manufacture as used in section 5 of the act referred to means to make irrespective of the quantity pro duced or the use to which it is to be put This is made clear by section 6 which provides that the provisions of the act shall not be construed to prevent any one from manufac turing for his own use unfermented wine or nonintoxicating cider wine for sacramental purposes or to prevent the manufacture of vinegar or nonintoxicating cider for sale In this case the exception proves the rule as to those things not excepted    It is claimed that because the defendant did no affirmative act to pro duce fermentation but simply put the grape juice into a vat and let nature take its course he did not manufacture the wine but this contention is unsound Under such a construction no wine ever has been or ever will be made by human agency The stipulation admits in substance that defendant placed the juice in the vat and there allowed it to ferment and that his intent was to use the greater portion as a beverage for himself and family as food with their meals and to allow the remainder to become vinegar He but pur sued the usual process of making wine The wellknown action of the air and the germs therefrom which produce fermentation were utilized and intended to be utilized in the process of manufacture Some of the most important compounds known to commerce and medicine are manufactured by bringing two or more substances in contact and allowing the chemical forces of nature to produce a new compound or substance The question is not as to the policy of the law but as to the power to enact it and this being found to exist the judgment of convic tion will be affirmed Limitation of Actions Suit by GovernmentStatutory Action for Injury to PropertyIn United States v Denver  R G R R in the United States

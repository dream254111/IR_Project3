their entire energies to the manufacture of small motors having built thirtysix hundred motors of i horse power and over five hundred i and A horsepower motors While this company have built motors as large as 5 horsepower they have not until recently when the new shops were completed undertaken to sup The machines present a few peculiarities The fieldmagnet cores are dropforged are circular in shape and are concentric with the shaft being oblong in crosssection and of a width equal to the axial length of iron in the armature These cores when bolted to the base of the polepieces completely surround the armature which is of the drum type and in its general proportions resembles a Gramme ring in which the radial depth is increased until the annular ring reaches the shaft thus forming a drum ar FIG iFIFTEENHORSEPOWER C  C MOTOR ply those of larger power their old shops having been fully occu pied with orders for small motors We recently described their new factory and since the company moved in Mr Lemuel William Serrell has designed for them mo tors as large as 25 horsepower The design of these larger motors is shown in the accompanying cuts Fig I is of a I 5 horse power Fig 2 of a 3 horsepower motor mature of large diameter This form requires little wire and the airspace resistance between the polepiece and the armature is re duced to a minimum The windings are calculated by dealing with the magnetic cir cuit as if it were an electric circuit following Ohms law magnetic potential taking the place of volts and lines of force current and the resistance of the iron when below saturation to the flow of    432 SCIENCE lines of force the resistance of a wire to an electric current The shortest possible length for the magnetic circuit is obtained by giv ing a circular form to the machine The result shows that the machines have come out very close to their estimated power the VOL XIII No 331 claimed to have considerable advantage over most slowrunning fans Two of these fans have been successfully employed to ven tilate a hall Ioo feet square being placed opposite each other and both used as exhausts Another method employed is to place one FIG 2

cities and towns received more attention than at present and perhaps no one thing has conduced to this state of affairs more than the discovery that certain salts contained in the earth act as renovaters of all socalled  spring  waters purging them so to speak of the foul matters held both in solution and in suspension Up to the time of this discovery it was thought that the earth acted merely as a filter or strainer on a large scale and that each grain or atom of earth acted its part toward opposing or arresting mpurities in the passing water in other words that only mechani cal straining or filtering took place and nothing more Multitudes of filters have been made and put in operation in all ages and countries with the expectation of seeing the water emerge from them as pure and sparkling as from a good spring and the greatest surprise has been manifested at the failure to secure the same results when apparently every condition was supplied The question remains  Was every condition supplied  Modern science answers No The peculiar action of the above salts upon the portion of im purities said to be held in solution is well illustrated by the effects produced by dissolving soap in a water of great so called hard ness The white flakes that almost instantly appear are composed not alone of dissolved soap for soft water would not show such individualized flakes but a mixture of soap and some substance hitherto held in undisturbed solution in the water but now with drawn from that condition and floating about in mechanical sus pension It will be plain that if this soaptreated water was now poured into the earth at one point and made to emerge at another some distance off it would be found purged of not alone the soap it con tained but also of the modicum of foreign matter held in its embrace and which went to make up the quality of hardness spoken of

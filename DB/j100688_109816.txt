portions of blood to be supplied to different parts of the body The facts which first led the author to entertain this opinion were the accidental consequence of an extremely painful application of pure kali to a wound which occasioned a general pulsation of the limb to which it was applied although the pulsations of distant arteries were at the same time undisturbed In order to be quite certain that this consequence was really dependent on the irritation of nerves the author made two experiments on rabbits in the neighbourhood of the carotid artery Having laid bare the par vagum and intercostal nerves a probe was passed under the former so as to separate it so that the irritation might be first given to this nerve alone but no sensible effect was thus produced upon the artery But when the same ap plication of pure kali was made to the adjacent intercostal nerve by which the artery is supplied the dilatations and contractions of the artery were considerably increased and the violence of the pulsations continued about three minutes before they began to subside The same experiment being repeated on a second rabbit was at tended with the same result and it was afterwards repeated on a dog without any perceptible difference These visible effects of the influence which the nerves possess over the arteries enable the author to comprehend more fully than he had done before how different supplies of blood are sent to particular glands how various secretions come under the influence of the mind and how the internal actions of the animal economy connected with the circulation of the blood are regulated If the healthy actions in the complete animal be thus dependent on nervous influence then also the restoration of parts injured the regeneration of parts lost and all even the most complicated forms of disease must be regulated by the natural or preternatural operation of the same machinery On the Means of producing a double Distillation by the same heat By Smithson Tennant Esq FRS Read June 30 1814 Phil Trans 1814p 587 When steam is passed through a tube surrounded with water it is well known that it becomes condensed on the sides of the tube so long as the water continues at a lower temperature than that of the steam but since the latent heat given out in the condensation of steam soon raises the temperature of the water to 2120 all transfer of heat ceases at that temperature and the steam then passes un condensed But since the temperature at which water may be raised into vapour depends on the pressure of the atmosphere the tempera ture of the surrounding water may be kept permanently lower by removing that pressure so as permanently to act in condensing the vapour of the first distillation and being itself raised into vapour by mere transfer of the same original quantity of heat may be received as an additional product of the same process by a suitable arrange ment of the apparatus515 For this purpose the vessel which serves as condensing wormtub to the first distillation requires to be fitted with a head and a receiver all perfectly airtight and it may with most convenience be so con structed that by application of heat in the first instance to this ves sel the water within may be made to boil completely so that the air within it will be thereby expelled and by a valve or cock may be prevented from returning when the heat is withdrawn An Account of some Experiments on Animal Heat By John Davy MD FRS Read February 17 1814 Phil Trans 1814 p 590 The experiments here detailed relate in the first place to the rela tive capacities of venous and arterial blood for heat secondly the comparative temperature of these fluids in different parts of the body during life is attempted to be ascertained and thirdly the author states those conclusions which he thinks may be drawn from his ex periments In his first experiments he endeavours to discover the relative ca pacities by the times of cooling equal volumes of venous and arterial blood regard being also had to the specific gravities of each When blood was taken from the jugular vein of a lamb and after the fibrin had been separated from it by stirring with a wooden spatula its specific gravity was found to be 1050 that of arterial blood from the same lamb similarly treated being 1047 The quantity of each taken for experiment was the same contained in the same vessel and heated to the same degree An equal quantity of water in this vessel had cooled from 120 to 800 in ninetyone minutes arterial blood cooled through the same interval in eightynine minutes and venous blood in eightyeight minutes and hence the author infers the capacity of venous blood to be to that of arterial as 92 to 93 7 that of water being 100 By other experiments made on various mixtures of these fluids with each other at different temperatures he estimates the proportion to be 93 to 93 7 In subsequent trials on the rates of cooling observed in blood that still contained its fibrin Dr Davy estimated the capacities of venous and arterial blood to be as 90 to 91 The next experiments were upon the proportional heat lost in a given time by mixtures of either kind of blood with water due allow ance being made as before for the difference of their specific gravi ties viz 1050 and 1049 In this mode of trial the proportions were nearly reversed the ca pacity of venous blood appearing to be 954 whilst that of arterial was no more than 948 But the author observes that these trials admit of less accuracy than the preceding and he would be inclined to consider the third set of experiments as most entitled to confidence Dr Davys first experiments on the actual temperatures of venous and arterial blood in the living body were made at the great vessels of the neck in lambs sheep and oxen and in each a difference was 2L 2

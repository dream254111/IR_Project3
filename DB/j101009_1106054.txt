Publishing Co v West decided re cently by the U S Dictrict Court for the Southern District of Geor gia the validity of the Espionage Act of Congress of June 15 1917 was sustained by Judge Speer Certain articles appearing in a pub lication issued by the plaintiff were held violative of the act and the court sustained the action of the Postmaster General in exclud ing the publication from the mails Post Master General Burleson ordered the secondclass mailing privilege of The Jeffersonian withdrawn and an injunction was asked to prevent compliance with the order The court refused a preliminary injunction but granted a rule to show cause why the injunction should not issue as re quested At this hearing the court decided that the petitioner was entitled to specific information as to the features of The Jefferson ian deemed so unmailable as to induce the conclusion that the pub lication was not a newspaper in the meaning of the law conferring the secondclass privilege This information having been furnished the case is stated and concluded as follows The question is pre sented Do the facts and the determination of the Postmaster Gen eral demand or justify a court of the United States in the interfer ence here sought with an administrative branch of government In the affidavit of the Postmaster General after the specification required by the court of the passages in The Jeffersonian held by him to be unmailable there appears the following statement 1917  537538 3 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S  Nov Deponent further says that in his judgment in their entirety the issues of The Jeffersonian evince a purpose and intent on the part of the publisher to willfully make or convey false reports or false statements with intent to interfere with the operation and suc cess of the military or naval forces of the United States to willfully obstruct the recruiting or enlistment service of the United States to the injury of the service   and that the circulation of such matter in causing antagonism and resistance among the people to the conduct of the war with respect to enlistments execution of the draft and the sale of bonds to raise revenue to carry on the war The Postmaster General further states under the sanction of his oath that he is advised and believes that there is an organized prop aganda which has inflamed a large body of people to such an ex tent that it constitutes in effect the advocacy of treason insurrec tion and forcible resistance to the laws of the United States Upon such information he states that this has been actually threatened and that prominent among the publications thus engaged is The Jeffersonian that the matter it produces to this end in contempla tion of the Espionage Act is nonmailable After due and thorough consideration deponent so decided but prior to his ruling that the issue of June 28 1917 was nonmailable the paper was submitted to the Attorney General of the United States and deponent was ad vised by the Attorney General that the paper was in violation of section 3 of title 1 of the Espionage Act For the same reason and because it contained matter of the same nonmailable description the Postmaster General after examination caused the postmaster at Thomason to be advised that the issue of August 16th was also unmailable Thus it will be seen that the court is advised of the concurrent opinion of two members of the cabinet the chief of the Post Office Department and the chief of the law department of the government in justification of the action of which plaintiff complains A supreme measure of legislation enacted by Congress for the successful prosecution of the great war in which the country is en gaged termed the Espionage Act in title 1 section 3 declares that whoever when the United States is at war shall willfully make or convey false reports or false statements with intent to interfere with the operation or success of the military or naval forces of the United States or to promote the success of its enemies and whoever when the United States is at war shall willfully cause or attempt to cause insubordination disloyalty mutiny of duty in the military or naval forces of the United States or shall willfully obstruct the recruiting or enlistment service of the United States to the injury of the service of the United States shall be punished by a fine etc In connection with this section 1 of title 12 of the same act must be considered This declares that every letter newspaper etc inviolation of any of the provisions of this act is hereby declared to be nonmailable and shall not be offered in the mails or delivered from any post office nor by any carrier The light afforded by these sec tions of a valid and vital law shone upon the pages of Thie Jeffer soniai when they were under the scrutiny of the members of the Presidents Cabinet Congress had declared war Thousands of the elite of the American army were on the soil of France At any mo ment the crash of their rifle fire and the thunders of their artillery in the vindication and defense of human liberty might be heard American menofwar manned by Americans were swiftly cleaving the waters forbidden by the enemy to our commerce questing every billow for his lurking and deadly craft By the thousands the gal lant youth of every American State were rallying to the flag In the vast oversubscription of the liberty bonds our people had proven that in thle common cause they will be as lavish of their treasure as of their blood Vith the utmiost nobility of soul with the selfsac rificial spirit of woman in the humane Red Cross and similar or ganizations our countrys daughters were no whit behind her sons At this juncture of the nations life the Postmaster General and the Attorney General have discovered in the plaintiffs publication which the Government through its mail was distributing to its peo ple siuch passages as this taken from the issue of June 28th Men conscripted to go to Europe are virtually condemned to death and everybody knows it President Wilson admitted as much in his Flag Day address   Why is your boy condemned to die in Europe Again in the issue of July 19th is a statement aimed at the Chief Magistrate of the United States That it is false that it was in tended to interfere with the operation or success of our forces that it was an attempt to cause insubordination disloyalty iimutiny or re fusal of duty by them the Postmaster General might well conclude Does he the President not know that the Conscription Act forc ing citizens out of the Union to die in Belgium and France is every bit as lawless as the action of the Phelps Dodge Copper Company in forcing these one thousand one hundred 1100 miners out of Arizona What are 1100 miners to six hundred and eightyfive thousand 685000 conscripts whom our Caesar has condemned to death in foreign fields of blood Nor is such reference as the following to the CommanderinChief of the Army and Navy of the United States made in time of war deterrent to insubordination disloyalty mutiny or refusal of duty Are welike the sow returning to her wallow and the dog to his vomitto go back to the medievalism of personal rulea Popes word ruling the church and a kings word ruling the State Why not call Woodrow Wilson by the name of king or kaiser 1917  539 NOTES OF CASES3 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S or czar if the constitution is to be treated as the kaiser treated the Belgian treaty The kaiser did not swear to support the Belgian treaty Wood row Wilson did swear to support the constitution And now within six months after taking that solemn and public oath the congressmen and president who did so are treating the constitution exactly as the kaiser treated the Belgium treaty Nor does Congress escape On page 4 of the issue of July 19th is printed the vote of the House on the question to create a national army This under the title these are the Representatives in Con gress Lower House who confiscated the liberty and the lives of your sons A more direct but not more effective effort to obstruct the re cruiting or enlistment service of the United States appears on page 7 of the issue of July 26 1917 I advise prints the editor of The Jeffersonian the conscripts to await the decision of the United States Supreme Court and not to be clubbed by the fact of conscription into enlistment Once you volunteer and sign up you can be sent anywhere and the law cant help you Equally but not more unmiailable in contemplation of tile act of Congress above quoted is the issue of August 16th In the affidavit before the court the Postmaster General as we have seen after charging the existence of an organized propaganda to discredit and handicap the government in the prosecution of the war declared that such matter is in violation of section 3 of title 1 and sections 1 and 2 of title 12 of the Espionage Act and is nonmailable That for these reasons the publication is not a newspaper or other pe riodical publication within the meaning of the laws of the United States governing mnailable matter of the second class and the de ponent so decided after due and thorough consideration of the mlat ters and things stated herein In this conclusion I find that he was fully justified In such crises in Lacedaenion the Spartan mother when her son went forth to battle was accustomed to exclaim return on your shield or with it How dissimilar how sordid is the cowardice The Jeffersonian would encourage What about a carload of German soap made out of our boy What about manuring German fields with our bravest youth and fattening German hogs on the choicest selection fromi American manhood I raised my boy to be a soldier says the song but did nlother raise him to be pig feed Had the Postmaster General longer permitted the use of the great postal system which he controls for the dissemination of such poi son it would have been to forego the opportunity to serve his coun try afforded by his lofty station 540 i NovNOTES OF CASES There is moreover an additional consideration of the weightiest character which obliges the denial of such an injunction as is here sought An appeal is made to an American court of equity to oblige the postal authorities of our country to contribute its mail ing facilities for the furtherance and success of a propaganda against the nation as distinct as it is truculent and dangerous Under the familiar rule in equity such an appeal is addressed largely to the discretion of the court It is to be determined by the conscience of the chancellor and always with proper regard to the public welfare This imports the countrys welfare and a party seeking this ex traordinary remedy under a rule equally familiar must come into court with clean hands Can one be said to come witli clean hands when the policy methods and efforts he would maintain may cause his hands to be imbrued in the blood of the demoralized and de feated armies of his countrymen If by such propaganda American soldiers may be convinced that they are the victims of lawless and unconstitutional oppression vain indeed will be the efforts to make their deeds rival the glowing traditions of their hero strain On the contrary the world will behold Americas degradation and shame the disintegration under fire of oivr line of battle the inglorious fight of our defenders like the recent debacle of the Russian army brought about by methods much the same the ultimate conquest of our country the destruction of its institutions and the perishing of popular government on earth The preliminary injunction is denied WillsConstructionLegacy of Corporate Stock General or SpecificWhether a bequest of corporate stock is to be construed as general or specific depends upon the intention of the testator In a recent case Re Will of Miller reported in New York Law Journal for August 8 1917 the New York Court of Appeals con strued a bequest whereby testator gave to each of his relatives and employees named a certain number of shares in a manufacturing company established and built up by him the aggregate being the whole number of shares owned by him and directed that at least three of such legatees should be present when the box containing the stock should be opened He further directed that all taxes ex penses of administration etc should be paid out of the proceeds of his other property to the end that the beneficiaries may receive their legacies without any deduction In holding the bequests specific the Court of Appeals said in part James T Miller died at Rochester N Y August 19 1913 leav ing a last will and testament wherein he bequeathed 2024 shares of the capital stock of the Kee Lox Manufacturing Company of Rochester in various amounts to thirteen relatives and seven em ployees of the company 1917  541

J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1014074,IS ECONOMIC REHABILITATION OF GERMANY ALONG SOCIALISTIC LINES POSSIBLE,I242681,IS ECONOMIC REHABILITATION OF GERMANY ALONG SOCIALISTIC LINES POSSIBLE BY ALFONS HORTENS BERLIN TRANSLATED BY KARL SCHOLZ PHD INSTRUCTOR IN ECONOMICS UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA GERMANYS NATIONAL DEBT TOTALS BETWEEN 260 AND 280 BILLION MARKS THE NATIONAL BUDGET FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 1920 ESTIMATES GOVERNMENT REVENUES AT ABOUT 42 BILLION AND EXPENDITURES AT ABOUT 109 BILLION MARKS AND CONSEQUENTLY SHOWS A DEFICIT OF ABOUT 67 BILLION MARKS ACCORDING TO THE REPORT SUBMITTED BY THE MINISTER OF FINANCE SEVERAL MONTHS AGO THE NA TIONAL RAILROADS ARE OPERATING AT A TOTAL ANNUAL LOSS OF SIXTEEN BILLION MARKS PRICES EVERYWHERE HAVE RISEN UNBEAR ABLY THE SUPPLY OF RAW MATERIALS AND ESPECIALLY OF FOODSTUFFS IS EXCEEDINGLY LOW IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF FOODSTUFFS AND OF MANU FACTURED ARTICLES THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE LARGE MASSES OF THE PEOPLE HAS BEEN EXHAUSTED CONSUMPTION HAS DE CREASED AND UNEMPLOYMENT HAS SPREAD ENORMOUSLY ACCORDING TO THE LATEST REPORTS OF THE NATIONAL DEPARTMENT OF LABOR THE TOTAL NUMBER OF WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY UNEMPLOYED AT PRESENT IS ABOUT THREE MILLION THE LARGE MASSES OF POPULATION EXPECT TO OBTAIN RELIEF BY SOCIALIZING ECONOMIC LIFE WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING CLEARLY WHAT IS MEANT BY SOCIALIZATION AND HOW IT IS TO BE BROUGHT ABOUT EVERYONE SIMPLY FEELS THAT SOMETHING DECISIVE MUST HAPPEN THAT AFFAIRS CAN NOT GO ON AS AT PRESENT AND IF SOME SORT OF RELIEF IS NOT SOON FORTH COMING GERMANY WILL HAVE TO FACE A HORRIBLE FUTURE IN THE FIRST PLACE WE MUST CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THE OBJECTIVES TO BE AT TAINED BY ALL RATIONAL SOCIALIZATION BEFORE WE CAN CONSIDER THE QUESTION OF SOCIALIZATION IN GENERAL OR TO BE MORE EXACT THE REHABILITATION OF GERMAN ECONOMIC LIFE WE MAY DESIGNATE THESE OBJECTIVES AS FOLLOWS 1 TO INCREASE PRODUCTION PARTIC ULARLY OF FOODSTUFFS AND INDUSTRIAL RAW MATERIALS 2 TO LOWER PRICES 3 TO SATISFY EMPLOYES AND WORK MEN 4 TO ELIMINATE UNEMPLOYMENT AND TO MAKE POSSIBLE FULLTIME EMPLOY MENT FOR ALL WHO ARE ABLE AND WILLING TO WORK THE FUNDAMENTAL OBJECTIVE IN THE QUESTION OF SOCIALIZATION THAT IS IN THE QUESTION OF HOW THE ABOVE FOUR DE MANDS MAY BE FULFILLED IS TO BE SOUGHT IN INCREASING THE PRODUCTIVENESS OF LABOR THIS AGAIN DEPENDS UPON IM PROVING LABOR CONDITIONS SUCH IM PROVEMENT HOWEVER AS HAS BEEN FRE QUENTLY DEMONSTRATED RECENTLY CAN BE ATTAINED NOT ONLY BY PROVIDING SUFFI CIENT NOURISHMENT AND CLOTHING AND BY PROTECTING THE LABORING CLASSES AGAINST THE DESPOTISM EXPLOITATION AND OPPRES SION OF THE EMPLOYER BUT ALSO BY GIVING THEM AN INSIGHT INTO THE CONDITIONS OF INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT AS WELL AS A VOICE IN THE REPRESENTATION AND A SHARE OF THE RESPONSIBILITY IN THE OPERATION OF THESE INDUSTRIES PARTICULARLY IN THE NEGO TIATIONS OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL FOR CARRYING OUT THE PROVISIONS OF THE AGREEMENT OF SPA THE DEMANDS OF THE WORKING CLASSES HAVE RECEIVED 142ECONOMIC REHABILITATION OF GERMANY DECIDED CONSIDERATION FOR NOT ONLY THE SPEAKERS FOR THE INDEPENDENT SOCIALISTS BUT ALSO THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE MAJORITY SOCIALISTS FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE WISSELL THE CHAIRMAN OF THE CHRISTIAN WORKMENS UNION IMBUSCH AND PROFESSOR HERKNER OF THE DEMO CRATIC PARTY UNANIMOUSLY DEMANDED FOR THE WORKMEN A VOICE IN THE MANAGE MENT OF INDUSTRY THEY CONSIDERED THIS A DECIDING FACTOR IN THE SOLUTION OF THE QUESTION OF SOCIALIZATION BY INCREASING PRODUCTION HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO YIELD TO THIS DEMAND OF THE WORKING CLASSES THE INDUSTRIES ARE SO TO SPEAK TO BE TURNED OVER TO THE WORKMEN AND NEVERTHELESS PRODUCTION IS TO BE INCREASED WHERE NOW THE INITIATIVE AND INTELLIGENCE OF OUR ABLEST PRIVATE ENTERPRISERS CAN ATTAIN ONLY INSUFFICIENT PRODUCTION A SOLU TION OF THIS QUESTION WHICH SEEMS TO EMBODY A REALIZATION OF TRUE SOCIALIZA TION APPEARS IMPOSSIBLE NEVERTHE LESS THERE IS A SOLUTION WHICH IS TO BE DEVELOPED FURTHER IN THE FOLLOWING TREATISE BEFORE TAKING UP A CONSIDERATION OF THE SOLUTION TO BE PROPOSED WE MUST FIRST EXPLAIN TWO CATCHPHRASES WHICH CONFUSE THE DISCUSSION OF SOCIALIZATION EVERYWHERE AND RENDER IT INEFFECTIVE THE FIRST CATCHPHRASE IS GOVERN MENT CONTROL OF INDUSTRY HAS FAILED PUBLIC WORKS WHICH ONE IS ACCUSTOMED TO DESIGNATE AS ENTIRELY SOCIALIZED OPERATIONS HAVE PRODUCED THE WORST ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL RESULTS IN CONSEQUENCE SOCIALIZATION OF INDUSTRY THAT IS TAKING OVER OF THE INDUSTRIES TO BE OPERATED BY THE STATE WOULD MEAN A FURTHER DECREASE IN PRODUCTION AND A FURTHER DEBASEMENT OF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THIS CATCHPHRASE IS ABSOLUTELY COR RECT THE OPERATION OF PUBLIC WORKS HAS FAILED COMPLETELY THE CAUSES FOR THIS ARE TO BE SOUGHT IN THE CUMBER SOME BUREAUCRATIC OPERATION AND IN THE SMALL PAY OF OFFICIALS WHO IN PER MANENT POSITIONS OBTAIN THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE PAY AT THE AGE OF 65 WHEN THEY ARE TOO OLD FOR EFFICIENT SERVICE AND WHO DEVELOP ONLY A VERY SLIGHT DEGREE OF INTEREST IN FAVORABLE ECONOMIC CONDI TIONS OF INDUSTRY AS A RESULT OF SHARES OF STOCK AND BONUSES ALLOTTED TO THEM STACKS OF RULES AND REGULATIONS KILL EVERY BIT OF INITIATIVE THEY MAY HAVE PROVIDING A FUND FOR PLANT ADDITION REQUIRES ABOUT ONE AND ONEHALF YEARS FROM THE TIME OF ITS PROPOSAL UNTIL IT BECOMES AVAILABLE WE CAN THERE FORE SEE THAT THE FAILURE OF GOVERNMENT OPERATION DOES NOT DEPEND UPON THE FACT THAT THE STATE IS THE OWNER OF THE PARTICULAR INDUSTRY BUT ESSENTIALLY UPON THE FACT THAT THE BUREAUCRATIC FORM OF CONTROL IN OTHER GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS IS EMPLOYED IN OPERATING INDUSTRIES SUCH CONTROL MUST BE DES IGNATED AS THE POOREST TYPE OF OPERA TION THAT CAN POSSIBLY BE DEVISED AS A RESULT OF THE UNIVERSAL CONDEMNA TION OF STATE CONTROL OF INDUSTRY THE LARGE MASSES OF THOSE WHO HAVE BUSIED THEMSELVES PERHAPS JUSTIFIABLY WITH THE WEIGHTY QUESTIONS OF SOCIALIZATION CONCLUDE THAT PRIVATE CONTROL OF INDUS TRIAL ENTERPRISES IN CONTRAST WITH STATE CONTROL IS THE ONLY CORRECT TYPE AND THAT ABOVE ALL THE SOCALLED INITIATIVE OF THE PRIVATE ENTERPRISER MUST BE PRESERVED EVEN IN EVERY TYPE OF SOCIAL IZATION IF OUR OWN ECONOMIC LIFE IS NOT TO BE DESTROYED THIS CATCHPHRASE THAT THE DELIGHT OF PRIVATE INITIATIVE OF THE ENTERPRISER MUST NOT BE IMPAIRED PLAYS BY FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE DISCUSSION OF SOCIALIZATION AT FIRST GLANCE IT APPEARS CORRECT TO THE LAYMAN BECAUSE IT CONTAINS SOMETHING PERTINENT BUT WHEN GENERALIZED IT LEADS TO THE MOST GLARING FALLACIES TO WHICH WE CAN TRACE THE UNIVERSAL CONFUSION THAT PREVAILS EVERYWHERE IN THE MINDS OF THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THE 143THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY QUESTION OF SOCIALIZATION IT THERE FORE REQUIRES AN EXACT INVESTIGATION BEFORE WE ENTER UPON AN ANALYSIS OF THE CONCEPT ENTERPRISER WE MUST CON SEQUENTLY FIRST BUSY OURSELVES WITH THE CONCEPT ENTERPRISE WE CAN DIVIDE THE SUM TOTAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES INTO TWO CLASSES TO THE FIRST CLASS BELONG THOSE INDUSTRIES THAT ARE STILL IN THE STATE OF FORMATION OR OF DEVELOP MENT ALSO THOSE THAT PRESENT MANY VARYING INDIVIDUAL PROBLEMS AND RE QUIRE QUICK DECISIONS IN OTHER WORDS THOSE IN WHICH THE CREATIVE ACTIVITY AND THE INVENTIVE SPIRIT OF THE INDIVID UAL ENTERPRISER ARE OF EXTREME IMPOR TANCE IN BRIEF IT INCLUDES PRODUC TION OF SPECIALIZED ARTICLES OF EVERY DESCRIPTION THE AGGREGATE OF NUMEROUS SMALL FACTORIES AND INDUSTRIAL PLANTS IN CONTRAST WITH THIS FIRST CLASS OF ENTERPRISES WE MAY DISTINGUISH A SECOND CLASS WHICH EMBRACES ONLY A RELATIVELY FEW LARGE INDUSTRIAL UNDER TAKINGS FULLY ESTABLISHED AND STAND ARDIZED HAVING PASSED THE STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT THEY ARE TODAY EMPLOYING UNIVERSALLY KNOWN METHODS OF PRO DUCTION WHICH ARE TAUGHT IN OUR TECH NICAL HIGH SCHOOLS HERE INVENTIVE ACTIVITY PASSES MORE INTO THE BACK GROUND WHILE THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY IS THE ESSENTIAL IN THE FIRST CLASS OF ENTERPRISES THUS WE WOULD INCLUDE WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY THE BUILD ING OF AIRPLANES SPECIAL CONSTRUCTION OF MACHINERY CABLE RAILWAYS CRANES AND THE ERECTION OF MASSIVE STRUCTURES BRIDGES TUNNELS AND THE LIKE IN CLASS 1 IN THE SECOND CLASS OF ENTERPRISES WHICH EMBRACES LARGESCALE PRODUCTS WE WOULD INCLUDE THE MINING OF COAL AND THE MAKING OF STEEL RAILS LOCOMO TIVES ELECTROMOTORS ELECTRIC CABLES CEMENT PAPER ETC THE INDUSTRIES IN CLASS 2 HAVE ALL PASSED THE STAGE OF CLASS 1 FOR AT AN EARLIER PERIOD THEY WERE IN THE STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT FOR EXAMPLE TELEPHONE AND ELECTRIC POWER TRANSMISSION WERE ALMOST EN TIRELY UNKNOWN THIRTY YEARS AGO WHILE TODAY THEY ARE QUITE INDISPENSABLE INDUSTRIES IN OUR ECONOMIC LIFE THE LINE OF DEMARCATION BETWEEN THE TWO CLASSES IS NOT SHARPLY DRAWN FOR THE INVESTIGATION HERE UNDERTAKEN WE MERELY NEED A GENERAL CONCEPT OF THIS DIVISION IF WE CONSIDER INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES FROM THE STANDPOINT OF SOCIALIZATION WE SEE THAT A CHEAP AND SUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF THE ESSENTIAL NECESSITIES OF LIFE IS THE FIRST OBJECTIVE OF ALL SOCIALIZA TION AND THAT EVERYTHING WHICH EXTENDS BEYOND THIS DOES NOT ENTER INTO THE CON SIDERATION OF THE QUESTION AT PRESENT EVERYTHING THAT IS A NECESSITY IS CON SUMED IN LARGE QUANTITIES AND THEREFORE MUST BE PRODUCED IN LARGE QUANTITIES SUCH PRODUCTION THEREFORE CAN BE BROUGHT ABOUT EXCLUSIVELY BY INDUS TRIES IN CLASS 2 CONSEQUENTLY WE NEED CONSIDER ONLY INDUSTRIES IN CLASS 2 IN OUR PROGRAM OF SOCIALIZATION THAT IS WELLKNOWN LARGESCALE PRODUCTIONS WHILE SPECIAL ENTERPRISES OF CLASS 1 MAY BE OMITTED FOR THE TIME BEING IF WE WANT TO CONSIDER IT AN INDUS TRIAL OPERATION AGRICULTURE IS APPAR ENTLY AN EXCEPTION BUT UPON CLOSER EXAMINATION WE DISCOVER THAT IT CAN ALSO BE PLACED IN THE ABOVE CLASSIFICATION CONTRASTED WITH INTEN SIVE AGRICULTURE ON THE LANDED ES TATES WHERE LARGESCALE PRODUCTION PREDOMINATES WE HAVE ALSO FARMING ON A SMALLER SCALE WHERE THE PERSON ALITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL LANDLORD SETS THE STANDARD IF WE NOW PROCEED TO THE ANALYSIS OF THE CONCEPT ENTERPRISER WE OBSERVE THAT THERE ARE VARIOUS CLASSES OF ENTER PRISERS EVEN AS THERE ARE A VARIETY OF ENTERPRISES THE INVENTOR THE CREA TOR THE VENTURESOME MERCHANT EN GROSSED IN HIS WORK WHICH FREQUENTLY EITHER THRIVES OR FAILS WITH HIM PRE DOMINATES IN THE ENTERPRISE OF THE FIRST 144ECONOMIC REHABILITATION OF GERMANY CLASS AFFAIRS ARE QUITE DIFFERENT WITH THE HUGE ENTERPRISE FOR LARGESCALE PRODUCTION HERE IN GENERAL TWO ESSENTIALLY AND FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFER ENT ENTERPRISERS APPEAR IN PLACE OF THE INDIVIDUAL ENTERPRISER ON THE ONE HAND WE HAVE THE INVESTOR IN THE LARGE ENTERPRISE GENERALLY ORGANIZED AS A COMPANY AND ON THE OTHER HAND THE DIRECTOR OF THE INDUSTRY CONSE QUENTLY WE HAVE TO DISTINGUISH THREE CLASSES OF ENTERPRISERS VIZ THE PRO DUCTIVE ENTERPRISER WHO IS THE GUIDING SPIRIT IN INDUSTRIES OF THE FIRST CLASS THE CAPITALISTIC ENTERPRISER WHO AP PEARS AS INVESTOR IN LARGER COMPA NIES FOR EXTENSIVE PRODUCTION AND THE ORGANIZING ENTERPRISER WHO GEN ERALLY PERFORMS MOST WEIGHTY ORGANI ZATION AND ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES IN COMPANIES ORGANIZED FOR LARGESCALE PRODUCTION IN A DISCUSSION OF SOCIALIZATION THE PRODUCTIVE ENTERPRISER DISAPPEARS SINCE AS HAS ALREADY BEEN SHOWN THE ENTERPRISE OF THE FIRST CLASS NEED NOT BE CONSIDERED IN CONNECTION WITH SOCIALIZA TION SO MUCH THE MORE IMPORTANT IS THE CONSIDERATION OF THE CAPITALISTIC AND ORGANIZING ENTERPRISERS AND THEIR MUTUAL RELATIONSHIP TO ONE ANOTHER IF WE INVESTIGATE THIS QUESTION PAR TICULARLY WITH REFERENCE TO SOCIALIZATION OF LARGESCALE PRODUCTION OF NECESSITIES WE FIND THAT HERE THE INFLUENCE OF THE CAPITALISTIC ENTERPRISER UPON THE ORGAN IZING ENTERPRISER IS EXCEEDINGLY DANGER OUS AND INJURIOUS TO SOCIETY THE INTEREST OF THE CAPITALISTIC ENTERPRISER IE OF THE INVESTOR CENTERS IN DERIVING A SUITABLY LARGE PROFIT FROM THE ENTER PRISE AND HE ATTAINS THIS WITHOUT CON SIDERATION OF PUBLIC INTEREST BY OFFER ING HIGH SALARIES AND LARGE SHARES OF STOCK TO THE ORGANIZING ENTERPRISER THAT IS TO THE DIRECTOR ENCOURAGING HIM TO OBTAIN A MAXIMUM INCREASE IN PROFITS IT IS DIFFICULT TO INCREASE THE PROFITS OF AN INDUSTRY BY LOWER 11 ING THE COST OF PRODUCTION AND MUCH EASIER TO ATTAIN THIS OBJECTIVE BY RAISING THE SELLING PRICE PARTICULARLY IN LARGESCALE PRODUCTION OF NECESSI TIES IT IS SIMPLY A QUESTION OF ELIM INATING COMPETITION OF THE INDUSTRIES BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT THE MASSES MUST AND WILL PAY THE HIGHER PRICES BECAUSE THEY NEED THE ESSENTIAL PRODUCTS THESE PRODUCERS AGREEMENTS LEAD TO THE ORGANIZATION OF MONOPOLIES SYNDICATES AND TRUSTS WHICH AS WE KNOW TODAY CONTROL OUR ENTIRE ECONOMIC LIFE AND EXTEND TO ALMOST ALL ESSENTIAL PRODUCTS THEY WERE NOT INJURIOUS TO GERMAN ECONOMIC LIFE BEFORE THE WAR PUBLIC CONTROL AND FOREIGN COMPETITION PREVENTED ANY EXCESSES BUT AS A RESULT OF THE WAR AND OF THE LOW EXCHANGE RATE AFTER THE WAR AND PARTICULARLY AS A RESULT OF THE COMPLETE HELPLESSNESS OF THE GOV ERNMENT IN GERMANY MORE SO THAN IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY THEY HAVE DEVEL OPED INTO A FRIGHTFUL MENACE TO ECO NOMIC LIFE THE PRICE OF COAL FOR EX AMPLE IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA IS ABOUT THREE TIMES THE PREWAR PRICE IN GERMANY EIGHTEEN TIMES WITH REFERENCE TO STEEL IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA PRICES HAVE LIKEWISE BEEN APPROXIMATELY TRIPLED IN GERMANY THE PRICE IS THIRTY TO FORTY TIMES THE PREWAR PRICE THE SAME HOLDS TRUE OF CEMENT AND OTHER IMPORTANT RAW MATERIALS FOR NATIONAL INDUSTRIES THE FEARFUL EFFECT OF THESE INCREASES IN PRICES OF RAW MATERIALS UPON THE ENTIRE ECONOMIC LIFE IS QUITE APPARENT FOR EXAMPLE SIMPLE CALCULATION SHOWS THAT THE ANNUAL DEFICIT OF OUR RAILROADS MENTIONED ABOVE AMOUNTING TO SIX TEEN BILLION MARKS MAY BE TRACED ALMOST ENTIRELY TO THE EXCESSIVE IN CREASE IN THE PRICE OF COAL AND PAR TICULARLY OF STEEL FOR THE EXORBITANT PRICES OF THESE PRODUCTS IN TURN CAUSE AN INCREASE IN PRICES OF MACHINERY FER TILIZERS AND BUILDING MATERIALS AND 145THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY CONSEQUENTLY IN THE COST OF PRODUCTION OF FOODSTUFFS WHICH AGAIN MEANS A RISE IN WAGES AND IN SALARIES WE SEE THEREFORE THAT WE HAVE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN HARMFUL AND USEFUL INITIATIVE OF ENTERPRISERS USEFUL INITIATIVE OF PRODUCERS IS THAT OF THE PRODUCTIVE ENTERPRISERS IN THE INDUSTRIES OF CLASS 1 THE INITIATIVE OF THE CAPITALISTIC ENTER PRISER WHO CONTROLS LARGE MONOPOLIES PRODUCING ESSENTIALS AND WHO RUINS OUR ECONOMIC LIFE BY IMPOSING MONOPOLIS TIC PRICES IS ON THE OTHER HAND EX CEEDINGLY HARMFUL AND FATAL IT ALSO EXERCISES A VENOMOUS EFFECT UPON THE INITIATIVE OF THE ORGANIZING ENTERPRISERS THE DIRECTORS OF THE INDUSTRIES WHO ARE FREQUENTLY PREVENTED BY THE DICTATES OF THE TRUST FROM EMPLOYING THEIR INITI ATIVE ENTIRELY FOR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL WELFARE THE ATTEMPTED OPPOSITION TO MONOPOLIES ON THE PART OF NATIONAL ECONOMIC BODIES THAT IS SUPERVISORY COUNCILS COMPOSED OF ENTERPRISER AND WORKERS HAS FAILED COMPLETELY THE GERMAN WORKMAN IS INFLUENCED BY THE ENTERPRISER TO SUCH AN EXTENT WITH PROMISES THAT HE GIVES HIS CONSENT TO ALMOST ABSURD INCREASES IN PRICES THE ONLY MEANS OF COMBATTING THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF CAPITALISTIC PRIVATE ENTERPRISERS IN MONOPOLY INDUSTRIES IS TO SUBSTITUTE PUBLIC CAPITAL FOR PRIVATE CAPITAL AT LEAST TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THE ABOVE CHARACTERIZED WRONGS MAY BE AVOIDED IN GENERAL WE MAY ARRIVE AT THE CONCLUSION THAT SOCIALIZA TION NEED BE CONSIDERED ONLY IN MONOP OLY INDUSTRIES PRODUCING THE NECESSI TIES OF LIFE FOR THESE THE BUREAUCRATIC FORM OF STATE CONTROL CAN NOT BE EM PLOYED WE MUST EMPLOY THE MORE SUITABLE FORM OF PRIVATE COMPANIES CORPORATIONS WHICH WILL INCREASE THE PLEASURE AND JOY OF WORK ON THE PART OF THE LABORER BY GRANTING HIM AN INTEREST IN THE MANAGEMENT AND A PART RESPONSIBILITY IN PRODUCTION OF THE PARTICULAR COMMODITY HOW IS SOCIALIZATION TO BE PUT INTO PRACTICE WHERE IS IT TO BEGIN COAL AND STEEL ARE THE BASIC PRODUCTS OF OUR ENTIRE INDUSTRY LEADING TO THE ULTIMATE SATISFACTION OF OUR REQUISITES IN TRANS PORTATION CLOTHING FOOD AND SHELTER IT WOULD BE WRONG TO BEGIN THE SOCIAL IZATION OF COAL ONLY THE IRON INDUS TRY IS BY NO MEANS TOO COMPLICATED TO PRESENT DIFFICULT PROBLEMS FOR SOCIALIZA TION IT CONSTITUTES A SIMPLE LARGE SCALE PRODUCTION WITH FEW PRODUCTS REMAINING UNIFORMLY THE SAME COAL AND STEEL INDUSTRIES ARE SO CLOSELY RELATED ECONOMICALLY THAT THEY CAN NOT BE SEPARATED WITHOUT INCURRING DECIDED ECONOMIC DISTURBANCES THE PRICE OF COAL IS ESSENTIALLY DETERMINED BY THE PRICE OF STEEL AND CAN ACCORDING TO THE NATURE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES BE RAISED OR LOWERED BY GRADATIONS IN STEEL PRICES FOR THIS REASON AND BECAUSE THE FLEECING OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC IS MUCH MORE PRONOUNCED IN STEEL PRICES THAN IN COAL THE SOCIALIZA TION OF THE STEEL INDUSTRY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT OF THE COAL INDUS TRY BOTH FINANCIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY IT IS EVIDENT THAT A SIMULTANEOUS SOCIALIZATION OF ALL COAL AND STEEL WORKS IS IMPOSSIBLE PARTICULARLY IF INDEM NIFICATION IS NOT PAID IN TERMS OF THE PRESENT INFLATED VALUE OF THE STOCK THE OPPOSITION OF THE CAPITALISTIC CLASS OF THE PUBLIC AND EVENTUALLY WITH THEIR ASSISTANCE THAT OF THE ENTENTE CAN NOT BE OVERCOME CONSEQUENTLY WE MUST GO FORWARD SLOWLY AND FIRST PROVE TO THE ENTENTE AND TO THE PUBLIC WITH A SUFFICIENTLY LARGE EXPERIMENT THAT IN A SOCIALIZED INDUSTRY INCREASED PRODUCTION AND LOWER PRICES CAN BE ATTAINED WHEN THAT HAS BEEN DONE A FURTHER CARRYING OUT OF SOCIALIZATION WILL PROCEED UNCHECKED THIS CON SIDERATION WOULD MAKE IT ADVISABLE FIRST TO EXPROPRIATE ABOUT 10 TO 15 PER CENT OF THE EXISTING COAL AND STEEL 146ECONOMIC REHABILITATION OF GERMANY INDUSTRIES AND TO ESTABLISH THEM AS A NEW STOCK COMPANY SHARES IN WHICH ARE HELD BY THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN THIS MANNER A LARGE MIXED INDUSTRY WOULD BE BROUGHT ABOUT WHICH WOULD BE SUPERIOR TO THE LARGEST GERMAN INDUSTRIES OF A SIMILAR NATURE AND WHICH WOULD BE MODELED EXACTLY ON THE OPERATING PRINCIPLES OF THE REMAIN ING PRIVATE INDUSTRIES THE PARTICIPATION OF THE WORKERS WOULD HAVE TO BE BROUGHT ABOUT SO THAT ONEHALF OF THE SUPERVISORY COUN CILS SEATS WOULD BE OCCUPIED BY RELI ABLE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE WORKMEN AND THE OTHER HALF BY RECOGNIZED INDUS TRIAL MANAGERS ECONOMISTS AND EXPERTS THAT IS BY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC IT NEED NOT BE FEARED THAT IN CONSEQUENCE A POLICY OF ONESIDED IN TERESTS OF THE WORKMEN IN THE COMPANY MIGHT BE BROUGHT ABOUT AS IS SHOWN BY THE FOLLOWING FACT IN OUR PRESENT MO NOPOLISTIC COMPANIES AND INDUSTRIES THE DIRECTORATE IS COMPOSED OF 100 PER CENT CAPITALISTIC INTERESTS THE PUBLIC ACTS AS COUNTERPOISE IN THE NEW COM PANY WE HAVE OPPOSED TO 50 PER CENT WORKMENS INTERESTS IN THE SUPERVISORY COUNCIL 50 PER CENT GENERAL INTERESTS AND THE LATTER ARE SUPPORTED BY THE PUBLIC WHO ARE REGULARLY INFORMED OF THE TOTAL OUTPUT COST OF PRODUCTION AND WAGES THE ASSURANCE THAT IN THE NEW COMPANY THE WORKERS INTEREST WILL NOT PREDOMINATE IS PERHAPS THREE TIMES AS GREAT AS IS THE ASSURANCE TODAY THAT IN OUR MONOPOLY INDUSTRY PRIVATE INTERESTS WILL NOT PREVAIL IN THE DIRECTORATE OF SUCH A COMPANY RELIABLE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE WORK MEN MAY ALSO BE EMPLOYED PARTICU LARLY IN THOSE DEPARTMENTS WHICH DEAL WITH SOCIAL QUESTIONS SUCH AS HOUSING PROBLEMS MANAGEMENT OF CONSUMERS ASSOCIATION PROVISION OF FOODSTUFFS FIXING SUITABLE WORK HOURS AND WAGES PREVENTING ACCIDENT INSURANCE ENTER TAINMENT EDUCATION AND ATHLETICS AS A RESULT OF THE COOPERATION OF THE RELIABLE REPRESENTATIVES IN THESE DEPART MENTS WITH THE REMAINING MEMBERS OF THE DIRECTORATE WHO SETTLE TECHNICAL AND COMMERCIAL QUESTIONS A MUTUAL CONFIDENTIAL RELATIONSHIP WILL BE ESTAB LISHED WHICH WILL ASSIST ESSENTIALLY IN INCREASING THE PLEASURE AND JOY OF PRODUCTION GOOD RESULTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN ATTAINED IN THIS RESPECT IN THE FACTORY VON FRESSE IN THE SOCIALIZED BUILDING OPERATIONS AND IN THE HOUSING PROJECT OF CAPTAIN SCHMIIDE EVEN VERY RADICAL COMMUNISTIC WORKMEN HAVE DECLARED AFTER TAKING INTO CONSIDERA TION THE ABOVE PROPOSALS THAT THE RESULTANT CONDITIONS IF SUFFICIENT NOUR ISHMENT IS OBTAINED MIGHT RESTORE FORMER PEACETIME PRODUCTIVITY IN THE COAL MINES THIS WOULD HAVE AN EXCEEDINGLY GREAT AND ALMOST INESTI MABLE BEARING UPON THE REHABILITATION OF GERMAN INDUSTRY THE DIFFICULT QUESTION OF PROFIT SHARING BY THE WORKMEN IN SOCIALIZED ENTERPRISES APPEARS IN QUITE A DIFFERENT LIGHT IF WE APPLY IT TO THE ABOVEMEN TIONED DIVISION OF THE VARIOUS ENTER PRISES INTO THE TWO CLASSES WE SEE THAT THE PROFITSHARING RESULTING FROM A POSSIBLE SOCIALIZATION OF ENTERPRISES IN CLASS 1 IS INSIGNIFICANT HERE WE HAVE FREE COMPETITION IT IS NOT A QUES TION OF ESSENTIAL PRODUCTS EXCESSIVE PRICES ARE THEREFORE PRECLUDED IN THE ENTERPRISES OF MONOPOLIES PRODUCING ESSENTIALS WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN CLASS 2 ON THE OTHER HAND THE INTEREST OF THE WORKER IN THE PRODUCTION IS EXCEED INGLY DANGEROUS IT WOULD MAKE THE WORKMAN A CAPITALIST AS IT WERE AND BEFORE LONG WE SHOULD NOTICE IN HIM ALL SYMPTOMS OF CAPITALISTIC GREED WITH WHICH WE ARE TODAY REPROACHING CAPITALISTS A FEW REMARKS MIGHT BE MADE CON CERNING SYNDICALISM AND GUILD SOCIALISM APPLIED TO THE PRACTICAL ILLUSTRATION OF 147THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY A HUGE MINING AND SMELTING PROJECT HERE EMPLOYED SUCH SOCIALIZATION WOULD MEAN THAT ALL SUPERVISORY COUNCIL SEATS WOULD BE OCCUPIED BY REPRESENTA TIVES OF THE WORKING CLASSES AND SINCE THE SUPERVISORY COUNCIL APPOINTS THE DIRECTORATE THE INFLUENCE OF THE WORKMEN WOULD SOLELY DETERMINE THE APPOINTMENT OF THE DIRECTORATE THE MONOPOLY INDUSTRIES PRODUCING ESSEN TIALS WOULD IN CONSEQUENCE BE SUBJECT TO THE DANGER OF A ONESIDED EMPHASIS OF THE WORKMENS INTEREST AS CON TRASTED WITH THE INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC THIS POSITIVELY MUST BE AVOIDED AS A CORRECT SOLUTION OF THIS PROBLEM IT APPEARS THAT THERE SHOULD BE A REPRESENTATION OF 50 PER CENT OF THE WORKERS AND 50 PER CENT OF THE PUBLIC IN THE SUPERVISORY COUNCIL AND ABOUT ONETHIRD OF THE CHIEF OFFICES SHOULD BE HELD BY RELIABLE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE WORKMEN IN THE DIRECTORATE AS APPLIED TO A LARGE MINING AND SMELTING PROJECT GUILD SOCIALISM PRE SENTS STILL OTHER PROBLEMS BY SEPARAT ING OUR INDUSTRIES INTO GUILDS SUCH AN ENTERPRISE AS MINING WOULD BE DIVIDED INTO FIVE OR SIX GUILDS WHICH WOULD PROBABLY MEAN HARMFUL RESULTS FOR IN DUSTRY IN GENERAL THAT WHICH WAS GOOD AND USEFUL UNDER OUR SIMPLE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS SEVERAL HUNDRED YEARS AGO IS NO LONGER SUITABLE FOR OUR LARGER INDUSTRIAL ORGAN IZATION TODAY AS IT HAS DEVELOPED IN OUR COMPLEX INDUSTRIES TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF OUR COMPLICATED ECONOMIC LIFE THE ADVANTAGES OF A SOCIALIZED LARGE COMPLEX INDUSTRY WHICH RELATIVE TO THE ORE AND COAL SUPPLY IS QUITE INDEPENDENT AND THEREFORE ABSOLUTELY OPPOSED TO ALL ATTEMPTS AT SABOTAGE MAY BE GLEANED FROM THE FOLLOWING IN THE FIRST PLACE IT MAKES POSSIBLE A LARGE CORPORATE ORGANIZATION ACCORD ING TO THE AMERICAN MODEL FURTHER MORE WITH THE HELP OF SUCH AN INDUSTRY THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE PRESENT MO NOPOLY PROFITEERING CAN BE CARRIED ON SUCCESSFULLY BY PUBLISHING REGULARLY THE COSTS OF PRODUCTION OF VARIOUS PRODUCTS SUCH AS COAL RAILS GIRDLES CYLINDERS AND WROUGHT IRON THEN THE FULL EXTENT OF PRESENTDAY PROFITEER ING WILL BECOME APPARENT AND WITH THE HELP OF THE PUBLIC WE CAN BEGIN THE LOWERING OF PRICES THIS WOULD MEAN THE BEGINNING OF THE REHABILITATION OF OUR FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC LIFE WHICH CAN NOT BE ACCOMPLISHED IN ANY OTHER WAY TODAY ADVANTAGES ARE ALSO TO BE DERIVED TO QUITE AN EXTENT FOR THE ENTIRE LABORING CLASS BY PUBLISHING WAGES WORK HOURS AND OTHER SOCIAL ARRANGEMENTS OF SUCH A SOCIALIZED IN DUSTRY THE WORKING CLASSES AND PAR TICULARLY THE INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS IN ALL OTHER INDUSTRIES OBTAIN AN EASY DEVICE WHICH AIDS THEM TO ESTABLISH SIMILAR WAGES AND SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THEIR PRIVATE ENTERPRISES TODAY THE IN DUSTRIAL COUNCILS ARE TO QUITE AN EXTENT INACTIVE BECAUSE ALL THIS DATA IS KEPT FROM THEM INTENTIONALLY IN VARIOUS INDUSTRIES MUCH DEPENDS UPON THE SUCCESS OF THE FIRST STEP IN SOCIALIZATION IN THIS MANNER PUBLIC OPINION AND THE ENTENTE MAY BE WON OVER TO SOCIALIZA TION AND AFTER THE NECESSARY EXPERI ENCE HAS BEEN OBTAINED WE CAN GO AHEAD MORE RAPIDLY IT DEPENDS UPON CONVERTING AT LEAST A DECIDED PROPOR TION ABOUT 20 TO 30 PER CENT OF THE PRODUCTION IN ALL ESSENTIAL INDUSTRIES IN THE MANNER ABOVE DESCRIBED AT FIRST IN THOSE INDUSTRIES WHICH OFFER A BASIS FOR QUICK DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICUL TURE THE PRODUCTION OF NITROGEN OF BUILDING MATERIALS OF AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND OF ELECTRICITY WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ABOUT TEN THOU SAND MODEL FARMS OF APPROXIMATELY 500 ACRES EACH AS BALLOD DESCRIBES THEM IN HIS WORK ON THE FUTURE STATE THE ENTIRE DOMESTIC NEED OF GERMANY IN FOOD STUFFS AND FIBRIN WOULD BE PROVIDED 148ECONOMIC REHABILITATION OF GERMANY FOR ALSO THE ELECTRIFICATION OF RAIL WAYS IF THE NECESSARY MACHINERY CAN BE PRODUCED IN LARGE INDUSTRIES WORK ING WITH LOWPRICED STEEL MIGHT BE BROUGHT ABOUT IN THE NEAR FUTURE THE ENORMOUS PROBLEMS HERE DESIG NATED WOULD ASSURE US THAT UNEMPLOY MENT WOULD DISAPPEAR FOR COUNTLESS YEARS TO COME WHETHER OR NOT ONE WILL CONTINUE BEYOND THE LIMIT OF 20 TO 30 PER CENT OF SOCIALIZED INDUSTRY AS INLICATED HERE TO 100 PER CENT ULTI MATELY MAY BE LEFT FOR FUTURE CON SIDERATION AFTER FAVORABLE OBSERVATIONS RESULTING FROM THE FIRST ATTEMPTS OF SOCIALIZATION ARE AT HAND MANY WEIGHTY REASONS CERTAINLY ARE AT HAND IN FAVOR OF LETTING CERTAIN TYPES OF PRIVATE INDUSTRIES EXIST TO COMPETE WITH SOCIALIZED INDUSTRIES THIS AT ALL EVENTS IS THE BEST WAY TO PREVENT RETROGRESSION AND OSSIFICATION THE QUESTION OF INDEMNIFICATION OF THE FORMER OWNERS HAS CAUSED A GREAT DEAL OF CONTROVERSY AS A RESULT OF THE PARTIAL SOCIALIZATION AS HERE PROPOSED WE ARRIVE AT A SATISFACTORY SOLUTION ON THE BASIS OF THE PRESENT HIGHLY INFLATED PRICES OF STOCKS INDEMNIFI CATION CAN NOT BE MADE FOR THEY CON TAIN EXCESSIVE PROFITS EXTORTED BY MO NOPOLISTIC EXPLOITATION OF THE PUBLIC PARTIAL SOCIALIZATION OFFERS THE POSSI BILITY OF LOWERING PRICES OF MONOPOLY PRODUCTS SENSIBLY AND CONSEQUENTLY OF BRINGIAG THE QUOTATION OF SECURITIES TO A SUITABLE LEVEL ON THE BASIS OF SUCH REDUCED QUOTATIONS ONE WILL THEN BE ABLE TO PAY INDEMNIFICATIONS UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS THE USURY AND EXCESSIVE MONOPOLY PROFIT OB TAINED DURING THE WAR AND AFTER THE WAR MIGHT ALSO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT A COMMISSION WILL BE APPOINTED TO ESTABLISH THE AMOUNT OF INDEMNIFICA TION THIS COMMISSION WILL PASS ITS DECISION ONE AND ONEHALF TO TWO YEARS HENCE IN PUBLIC SESSION BY THAT TIME THE LOWERING OF PRICES AND QUOTATIONS WILL HAVE BEGUN THE TRANSFER OF PROPERTY OF INDUSTRIES TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC WILL TAKE PLACE AT A TIME OFFI CIALLY SET BY THE COMMISSION UNTIL THAT TIME THE INDUSTRIES WILL BE LEASED TO THE PUBLIC DURING THIS COMPULSORY LEASEHOLD SUITABLE SUMS TO DEFRAY INTEREST CHARGES ON MORT GAGES AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE EXPRO PRIATED FIRMS AND INDIVIDUALS SHOULD BE ALLOWED A SUMMARY OF THE ABOVE DISCUSSION SHOWS THE FOLLOWING 1 IN THE FIRST PLACE SOCIALIZATION MUST BEGIN SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH STEEL AND COAL 2 IT MUST PROGRESS STEP BY STEP BY FIRST SOCIALIZING AN ECONOMICALLY QUITE INDEPENDENT AND WELLESTABLISHED INDUSTRY 3 THIS INDUSTRY WILL BE PLACED UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC TOGETHER WITH EQUAL PARTICIPATION OF THE WORKING CLASSES SO THAT THE INTER ESTS OF BOTH PARTIES MAY BE EXPRESSED PROPORTIONATELY 4 THE OPERATION OF THE INDUSTRY IN GENERAL MUST BE CONDUCTED ALONG LINES OF PRIVATELYMANAGED INDUSTRY BUREAUCRATIC CONTROL MUST BE ABSO LUTELY AVOIDED 5 WITH THE PUBLISHING OF THE COSTS OF PRODUCTION IN SUCH AN INDUSTRY THE INFLATED PRICES OF THE MOST IMPORTANT RAW MATERIALS CAN BE REDUCED AND CON SEQUENTLY OUR ECONOMIC LIFE CAN BE GRADUALLY RESTORED 6 WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PER FECT SOCIAL WORKING CONDITIONS IN A LARGE SOCIALIZED INDUSTRY IT IS MADE POSSIBLE TO CARRY OUT THESE WORKING CONDITIONS IN THE REMAINING INDUSTRIES BY MEANS OF INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS 149

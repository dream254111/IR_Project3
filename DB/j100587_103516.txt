V Praes T H E Design of this Treatise is to give an Ac count of some new Astronomical Discoveries re lating to the Planet Venus which the Author dispo ses under four Heads viz 1 The Description of the dusky Spots observed in her Disk 2 Her Rotation round an Axis the Position of which is determined by the apparent Motion of those Spots together with the Time of her Re volution 3 The Parallelism of that Axis to it self in all Parts of the Planets Orbit 4 Observations in order to determine the Horizon tal Parallax of Venus and consequently those of the Sun and other Planets 1 He159 He takes Notice of five remarkable Spots in her whole Surface the two smallest of which are placed one near each Pole the other three lie along the AEqua tor and cover good Part of a Zone extended to about 30 Deg of Latitude on each Side He represents them to be much like the larger dark Spots in the Moon which are usually called Seas but considerably fainter so as not to be easily discernable even to a sharpinferredinferred sighted Observer without the Assistance of a Tele scope capable of representing distinctly the Planet under an Angle equal at least to that under which the Moon appears to the naked Eye and with an Aperture of 3 or 4 Inches of the Roman Palm He then proceeds to give the Description of a Machine contrived by him to represent to the Sight the Mo tion of the Earth and Venus in their Orbits and by the Means of a Lamp placed in the Center to shew the Phases of the Planet and Appearance of the Curve Lines described by the Revolutions of the Spots round the Axis This Revolution he makes greatly different from those of the Earth and Mars the two Bodies next in order of the Planetary System both in the Positi on of the Axis and Time of the Period He places the Colurus Solstitiorum or Plane passing through the Axis of the Planet and Tropical Points of its Orbit about the 20th Degree of Leo and Aquarius and gives the Planes of its AEquator and Ecliptick an Inclination to each other of about 75 Degrees He determines the Time of the Revolution to be about 24 Days and 8 Hours instead of 23 Hours as it has been generally taken to be from some Observations made by Mr Cassini in the160 the Years 1666 and 1667 but which he himself did not seem much to rely on Now both these Periods may be very consistent with the same Observations provided that one of the Observers did not continue his Observations for any considerable Time at once For if the exact Situation of any Spot be observed at any given Hour one Day and at the same Hour the succeeding Day be found advanced about 15 De grees or 124 of the whole Revolutionit may still remain doubtful whether the Spot has moved only thro those 15 Deg in that Day or has made one or more en tire Revolutions besides in that Time This the Au thor was aware of and therefore waited for an Oppor tunity of attending to the Motion of a Spot as long at once as the Vicinity of Venus to the Sun would ad mit of Accordingly Feb 26 1726 a little after Sun set he observed a Spot near the Center of her Disk where their Motion is most perceptible in a short Time and about 3 Hours after perceived the same Spot not sensibly removed from which he concluded the Pe riod of its Revolution could not be so short as one Day since if it were so the Change of Place of the Spot must have been very sensible in that Time It were to be wished the Author had had Opportunities of con firming this Period by more Observations especially since it was necessary to begin them soon after Sun set and continue them till Venus was near the Hori zon the Strength of the Twilight in the first Case and the Thickness of the Atmosphere through which the Planet must be seen in the latter rendring the Observations very difficult The161 The next Article of his Observations is the Con tinuance of the Axis in the same Parallelism through the whole Orbit of the Planet This is so necessary and obvious a Consequence of the established Laws of Motion that there needs no more to be said about it The 4th Article contains an Account of some Ob servations made to determine the Parallax of Venus in the Year 1716 The Method he used for this Pur pose was to take the several Distances of Time be tween the Appulse of the Limb of Venus and of Re gulus which Star she passd by about that Time to a horary Circle very near the Meridian and to another about 6 Hours after which he measured by the Pul ses of a Watch of which 143 went to 1 first Minute of Time He likewise observed the Alteration of those Distances taken at the same Hour several Days one af ter another and allowing a proportional Alteration for the Time between the two Observations he com puted what the Difference of their right Ascension ought to have been in the latter of them if there were no Parallax then comparing this Difference with that observed he concluded the Disagreement to be the Parallax of right Ascension This Method the Author seems to depend on so much as to think that an equal Degree of Exactness is hardly to be expected from any other hitherto practised But if we consider that the whole Parallax of right Ascen sion amounts by his Observations to no more than 4 Pulses of his Watch and that he allows a Possibility of an Error of near one of those Pulses in taking each of the Transitsit is evident that if such an Error be actually committed in each of the Observations on which the finding of the Parallax depends and all of them hap Z pen162 pen to conspire the same Way the Result of all to gether may possibly be greater than the whole Paral lax found Upon the whole he makes the Horizon tal Parallax of Venus at that Time to have been 24 20 and that of the Sun 14 18 but as he takes no Notice of the Latitude of the Place in deducing the Horizontal Parallax from that of right Ascension they both ought to be encreased on that Account by about 13 or in Proportion of 3 to 4 If therefore there be no other Mistake in his Numbers the Ho rizontal Parallax of the Sun as deduced from his Ob servations should be about 19 He concludes with giving some Cautions to those who may attempt hereafter to repeat these Observati ons both in Regard to the Time proper for it and the Choice and Constitution of the Telescope to be made use of For greater Ease of the Observer there is at the End a double Table containing the Heliocentric and Geocentric Motions of Venus for eight Years after which Space of Time the Earth and Venus re turn very nearly to the same Situation In this Table he says are marked the most convenient Times for ob serving but these Marks by some Oversight are omit ted in the Table For a Telescope of 100 Roman Palms he allows an Aperture of 3 or 4 Inches of that Palm with an Eye glass whose focal Length may be from 7 to 11 of the same but what he directs in longer Instruments to increase the Breadth of the Aperture and focal Length of the Eyeglass in the same Proportion with the In strument must certainly be the Effect of some Mi stake For in this Case a longer Telescope will mag nify no more than the shorter but only have the 1 Strength163 Strength of Light in the Object

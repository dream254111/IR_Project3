binding in the Library journal Jan 1883 viii 6 7 Covers for these pamphlets are punched with holes in the hinge or flap at the same distances so that all covers fit all pamphlets One or one hundred pam phlets can be inserted in a cover The backs are made of heavy manila as wide as the thickness of the book with a margin folded over to be punched with holes so that the back is laced between the pamphlets and the cover By lacing the backs to the covers first with thread or otherwise and then in serting the pamphlets on a separate cord the covers do not fall away when the binding cords are with drawn Of course if desired the backs can be glued to the covers One objection to Mr Goodes method of having stubs permanently bound in the covers is that no such rearrangement can be made as may be desired The backs are also of definite width and cannot be enlarged as may be required for convenience A pamphlet cover made as I recommend if not tightly laced will admit of laying in 50 per cent more pam phlets than are tied in before it is necessary to re bind If for any reason it is desired not to mutilate a pamphlet by making holes in it it can be glued to a stub or placed in an envelope glued to a stub and the stub can be perforated Manila sheets can be prepared by the thousand perforated with the standard holes and newspaper scraps etc mounted upon them as desired and these bound with the pamphlets By pasting only on the recto and marking the guide words or sym bols on upper lefthand corner of verso these words or symbols can be readily caught by the eye as the leaves are turned When scraps occupy more than one sheet the several sheets can be glued or tied together so that they may afterward be handled as units It will be found better in the end to put but one scrap on a sheet so that the sheets may index themselves in the arrangement Next as to the arrangement and classification The Dewey decimal classification and relative index is pronounced by many of the foremost librarians to be the greatest invention of the century in library economy Its applicability ranges from that of assist ing the schoolboy to keep his notes to that of the president of the Royal astronomical society in classifying his library Its simplicity is that of the Roman alphabet and the Arabic numerals its com prehensiveness is that of assigning a subject number for instance to the spherical excess in the com putation of a triangulation in geodetic work viz 52641 or separately indicating songs for male voices 78487 and songs for female voices 78488 Its index in the new edition just issued contains nearly 9000 topics and three tables allow these topics to be developed fully one hundred fold without loss of simplicity One reference usually suffices to find the subject number of a topic and by it a set of ten manuscript notes could be marked so that they need not be marked over to locate them in a library of ten thousand volumes for the symbols would indicate not only what they were about but where they were The use of this system can be seen in my own library and manuscripts or in the catalogue I am making of the books and pamphlets in the entomo  NCE VOL VI No 144 logical division of the U S department of agricul ture A description of the system is given in chapter xxviii pp 623648 of the special report on libraries published by the U S bureau of education in 1876 I pay about one cent each for my pamphlet covers octavo or quarto They are serviceable but not elegant but they hardly show on the shelves B PICKMAN MANN Star catalogues Would you please tell me where I could obtain a catalogue of the stars and what would be the cheap est price I would have to pay H C I If our correspondent would state a little more definitely the use for which the catalogue is desired we should be glad to give the necessary information A great number of star catalogues are published no two just alike The star list of the American ephem eris to be obtained from the office of the American ephemeris Washington price 1 would perhaps answer his purpose while for identifying the con stellations etc Heiss Atlas ccelestis novus would probably be found most useful and Webbs  Celestial objects giving a valuable list of colored stars nebulee clusters etc should be owned by every one that possesses an astronomical telescope ED Calendar reform I notice in the supplement to No 140 an article on reform in our calendar by Mr Paul He refers to two changes in our method of reckoning time pro posed by M Jules Bonjean one affecting the monthly calendar the other the weekly Changes in the monthly calendar in past time have by no means been infrequent but of such a capri cious character as to result in great irregularities and an inconvenient arrangement This is a fair subject for reform by way of simplification But a change or break in the weekly cycle for the sake of beginning every year with the same nominal day of the week is quite another affair Here we should touch upon questions of religious belief which can not be discussed in the columns of Science But the monthly calendar being of human devis ing is open to improvement In regard to this M Bonjeans proposal and my own in No 108 Feb 27 agree in placing the intercalary day at the end of the year and in making the months to consist alternately of 30 and 31 days But he would begin the year by giving January 30 days and February 31 and thus proceed This method would require a change in the number of days in 8 months out of the 12 in ordinary years But by beginning the first half of the year with a month of 31 days and the second half with one of 30 days as in our present calendar only 3 months would be changed in an ordinary year including December and in leap year only February and July Thus convenience and symmetry would be secured with the least possible change EDWARD P GRAY The swindling geologist A thief representing himself as Leo Lesquereux jun and also as one Strong

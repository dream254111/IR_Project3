J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1011427,BUDGET PROVISIONS IN COMMISSIONGOVERNED CITIES,I242621,BUDGET PROVISIONS IN COMMISSIONGOVERNED CITIES BY L G POWERS CHIEF STATISTICIAN BUREAU OF THE CENSUS WASHINGTON D C THE COMMISSION FORM OF GOVERNMENT IS BEING ADVOCATED AT THE PRESENT TIME IN THE UNITED STATES BY THE TWO CLASSES OF PEOPLE WHO ARE AS WIDELY SEPARATED IN THEIR MOTIVES FOR URGING ITS INTRODUCTION AS THE POLES OF THE EARTH THE MEMBERS OF ONE OF THESE CLASSES FAVOR THE GALVESTON OR DES MOINES PLAN BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE IT WILL AFFORD THE MASSES A BETTER KNOWLEDGE OF AND CONTROL OVER MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS AND THAT THERE CAN BE NO PROGRESS OR IMPROVEMENT OF CITY GOVERN MENT WITHOUT THE ACTIVE PARTICIPATION OF THE PEOPLE AS A WHOLE IN SUCH GOVERNMENT THE SECOND CLASS ADVOCATE THE SCHEME FROM AN OPPOSITE MOTIVE ITS MEMBERS DESPAIR OF POPULAR GOVERNMENT AND FAVOR A BENEVOLENT DESPOTISM WHICH THEY CONCEIVE THE COMMISSION PLAN OF GOVERNMENT TO BE BUT STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM BOTH CLASSES URGE THE ADOPTION OF THE COMMISSION PLAN BECAUSE IT SECURES A GREATER PUBLICITY OF AFFAIRS AND THROUGH THAT PUBLICITY MORE ECONOMICAL AND EFFICIENT ADMINISTRATION BUT PUBLICITY OR PROVIDING INFORMATION FOR THE USE OF THE PUBLIC CANNOT BE A FACTOR OF CONTINUING GOOD GOVERNMENT UNLESS THE POPULAR JUDGMENT BASED ON THAT INFORMATION AND THE POPULAR CONTROL WHICH RESULTS THEREFROM ARE BENEFICIAL IN URGING THE ADDED PUBLICITY THAT FOLLOWS THE INTRODUCTION OF THE COMMISSION FORM OF GOVERNMENT AS A REASON FOR THE ADOPTION OF THAT FORM THE ADVOCATES OF A BENEVOLENT SYSTEM OF MUNICIPAL DESPOTISM IN REALITY DISCARD THEIR THEORETICAL POSITION AND RECOGNIZE THAT DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT BASED UPON POPULAR INTELLIGENCE IS THE ONLY FORM THAT CAN BE DEPENDED UPON TO BE EFFICIENT AND ECONOMICAL IN OTHER WORDS THEY TACITLY ADMIT THAT MORE DEMOCRACY IS THE CURE FOR THE ILLS OF DEMOCRACY AS WE NOW FIND THEM IN CITY GOVERNMENTS THE WRITER WILL NOT HERE DISCUSS THE QUESTION OF HOW THE VARIOUS CITIES INTRODUCING THE COMMISSION FORM OF GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN GIVEN GREATER PUBLICITY OF AFFAIRS AS THE RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF THE 798BUDGET PROVISIONS IN COMMISSIONGOVERNED CITIES NEW ORGANIZATION A HASTY AND THEREFORE MORE OR LESS IMPERFECT STUDY IN THIS FIELD DISCLOSES THE FACT THAT THE ADDED PUBLICITY AND THE INCREASED POPULAR INTEREST WHICH HAVE BEEN AWAKENED THEREBY RESULTING IN BETTER GOVERNMENT HAVE HAD DIFFERENT CONTRIBUTING FACTORS IN THE CITIES SO FAR INTRODUCING THE NEW FORM SOME OF THESE FACTORS ARE LOCAL AND TRANSIENT IN THEIR NATURE AND CANNOT REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO BE CONTINUOUS IN THEIR OPERATION AND HENCE ASSIST IN SECURING ECONOMY AND EFFICIENCY OF GOVERNMENT FOR ANY GREAT NUMBERS OF YEARS ONLY ONE OF THEM CAN BE MADE A CONTINUOUS AND POTENT AGENT OF GOVERNMENTAL PUBLICITY AND THAT IS THE BUDGET OR ANNUAL APPROPRIATION ACT IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT COMMISSIONS WHICH BY THE PRESENT POPULAR WAVE ARE BEING INTRUSTED WITH A LARGE PLACE IN THE GOVERNMENT OF OUR CITIES IF DESIROUS OF ADVANCING EFFICIENT AND ECONOMICAL AS WELL AS WISE ADMINISTRATION WILL FIND A SCIENTIFICALLY ARRANGED BUDGET SUPPORTED BY PROPER ACCOUNTS REPORTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY STATEMENTS THE MOST EFFECTIVE AGENT FOR KEEPING IN TOUCH WITH THE PEOPLE AND BRINGING THEM TO THE SUPPORT OF GOOD PLANS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF CITY FINANCES BUT HOW SHALL A BUDGET BE SO ARRANGED AS FITTINGLY TO BE CALLED SCIENTIFIC OR WHAT SHALL BE ITS PROVISIONS THAT IT MAY BY THE PUBLICITY THAT IT AFFORDS BE A CONTINUING FACTOR OF GOOD EFFICIENT AND ECONOMICAL GOVERNMENT IN PRESENT CITY GOVERNMENTS BY COUNCILS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS BUDGETS TOO FREQUENTLY ARE PATTERNED UPON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF PRIVATE CORPORATIONS WHICH ARE SO ARRANGED AS TO CONCEAL FROM THE STOCKHOLDERS AND FROM ALL BUT A SELECTED FEW THE REAL RESULTS OF FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS AND THE REAL CONDITION OF BUSINESS AFFAIRS THE PRIVATE CORPORATIONS REFERRED TO USE AS ONE OF THE AGENTS OF THIS CONCEALMENT WHAT ACCOUNTANTS CALL SECRET RESERVES OR ASSETS COV ERED UP UNDER DESIGNATIONS THAT MAKE THEM APPEAR AS NEGATIONS OF PROPERTY OR EVEN AS LIABILITIES SUCH STATEMENTS IN PRIVATE CORPORATE ACCOUNTING ARE NEARLY ALWAYS MADE FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENABLING THOSE MANIPULATING ACCOUNTS AND STATEMENTS TO SECURE A GAIN FOR THEMSELVES AT THE EXPENSE OF THE GREAT BODY OF THE STOCKHOLDERS AND WHETHER MADE WITH SUCH INTENT OR NOT THEY ALWAYS WORK TO THAT END GOVERNMENTAL BUDGETS FRAMED ALONG THE LINES OF PRIVATE COR PORATE ACCOUNTS AND STATEMENTS WITH SECRET RESERVES ARE STATEMENTS OF PROPOSED EXPENDITURES AND OF METHODS OF PROVIDING MONEY FOR 799 129THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY MEETING THE SAME WHOSE SIGNIFICANCE A LIMITED FEW IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODIES FULLY UNDERSTAND BUT WHICH IS NOT APPARENT TO THE AVERAGE PERSON WHO WILL GIVE TOIT A MEANING QUITE DIFFERENT FROM ITS ACTUAL SIGNIFICANCE SUCH BUDGETS MAY BE EMPLOYED BY CITY COMMISSIONERS BUT IF SO USED TO ANY GREAT EXTENT WILL INEVITABLY LEAD TO GRAFT INEFFICIENCY AND WASTEFULNESS AND THAT FORM IS DOOMED THE CORRELATIVE OF PRIVATE SECRET RESERVES IS USUALLY FOUND IN THE INCOM PLETENESS OF CITY BUDGETS AND THEIR LACK OF SYSTEMATIC ARRANGEMENT AND THUS OF LUCID OR INTELLIGENT PRESENTATION THESE DEFECTS WILL BE CONSIDERED IN THE ORDER HERE MENTIONED TO BE AN INSTRUMENT OF COMPLETE PUBLICITY CONCERNING PROPOSED FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS MUNICIPAL BUDGETS MUST HAVE THE SAME CHAR ACTERISTICS AS THE BUDGETS OF THE BRITISH NATIONAL GOVERNMENT FROM WHICH WE DERIVE THE WORD BUDGET WITH THE SIGNIFICANCE WHICH IT NOW HAS IN MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS THEY MUST BE COMPLETE STATEMENTS OF THE PROPOSED EXPENDITURES FOR THE ENSUING YEAR WITH FINANCIAL PROPOSALS FOUNDED THEREON INCLUDING STATEMENTS OF PROPOSED TAX RATES AND MONEYS TO BE OBTAINED BY THE USE OF GOVERNMENTAL CREDIT A COMPLETE BUDGET SUCH AS HAS BEEN HERE DESCRIBED WHETHER FRAMED ALONG INTELLIGIBLE LINES FOR DETAILS OR OTHERWISE SHOWS THE RELATION OF REVENUES TO EXPENDITURES AND THE NET EFFECT OF THE PRO POSED FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE YEAR UPON THE AMOUNT OF MUNICIPAL INDEBTEDNESS IT DISCLOSES WHETHER THE EXPENDITURES WILL EXCEED OR FALL SHORT OF THE REVENUES AND THUS WHETHER THE EXPENDI TURES MUST BE MET IN PART BY THE ISSUE OF BONDS OR OTHER FORMS OF CREDIT OR WHETHER THE END OF THE YEAR WILL FIND THE CITYS INDEBTEDNESS DECREASED OR ITS AVAILABLE RESOURCES INCREASED THIS INFORMATION IS NEEDED BY THE COMMISSION UNDER THAT FORM OF GOVERNMENT OR ITS MEMBERS CANNOT HAVE THE BASIS FOR ANY BROAD OR COMPREHENSIVE PLANS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF CITY FINANCE WITHOUT WHICH NEITHER THEY NOR ANY OTHER SET OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS CAN ADMINISTER MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS EITHER INTELLIGENTLY OR WELL FURTHER WITHOUT GIVING THE CITIZENS OF THE MUNICIPALITY THIS INFORMATION IN THE BUDGET OR OTHERWISE THERE CAN BE NO BASIS FOR AN INTELLIGENT POPULAR JUDG MENT CONCERNING THE WISDOM OF THE GENERAL PLANS FOR THE COMMUNITY THE CITY MAY HAVE A BENEVOLENT OR WELLMEANING DESPOTISM BUT SUCH WELLMEANING OR GOOD INTENTIONS IN GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS WITHOUT ADEQUATE KNOWLEDGE ARE USUALLY THE PAVING STONES OF AN INFERNO OF BAD AND INEFFICIENT ADMINISTRATION THAT WILL SURELY BE LET 800 130BUDGET PROVISIONS IN COMMISSIONGOVERNED CITIES LOOSE ON THE COMMUNITY NOT GOVERNED BY INTELLIGENCE OR DIRECTED BY WELLCONSIDERED FINANCIAL PLANS THE CITY WILL DRIFT UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WITHOUT ANY WELLDIRECTED POPULAR JUDGMENT CON CERNING ITS AFFAIRS AND THERE IS NO CHARM IN THE NAME COMMISSION THAT WILL SAVE THE COMMUNITY FROM LACK OF KNOWLEDGE FOR WHICH THE PEOPLE PERISH TODAY AS IN THE DAYS OF ANCIENT WRIT THE INCOMPLETENESS OF AMERICAN MUNICIPAL BUDGETS USUALLY RESULTS FROM PREPARING THOSE DOCUMENTS IN SECTIONS AT DIFFERENT TIMES CITIES WITH THE MOST DEFECTIVE FINANCIAL PROPOSALS OF THIS CHARACTER ARE THOSE WHICH INTRODUCE AND PASS REVENUE APPROPRIATIONS OR APPROPRIATIONS FOR DEPARTMENTAL EXPENSES AND OUTLAYS TO BE MET FROM REVENUE IN A NUMBER OF SECTIONS AT DIFFERENT TIMES CITIES WITH THE LEAST DEFECTIVE BUDGETS IN THIS RESPECT ARE THOSE WHICH MERELY SEPARATE APPROPRIATIONS FROM BOND ISSUES AND EXPENDITURES TO BE MET FROM SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS FROM OTHER APPROPRIATIONS THE VARIATION BETWEEN THESE CLASSES OF CITIES IS ONE OF DEGREE BUT NOT OF CHARACTER IN MAKING APPROPRIATIONS EXPENDITURES AND THE RESOURCES FOR MEETING THEM SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS PARTS OF THE SAME WHOLE AND NO BUDGET OF MUNICIPAL EXPENDITURES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED COMPLETE UNLESS IT IS ACCOMPANIED WITH TWO PROPOSALS SETTING FORTH HOW THE MONEY IS TO BE RAISED FOR MEETING THE PROPOSED EXPENDITURES IF AUTHORIZED THE NECESSITY FOR THIS COMPLETENESS OF BUDGET CAN BEST BE SEEN IN ONE OF ITS ASPECTS WHEN IT IS CONSIDERED IN ITS RELATION TO THE CITY PLANNING MOVEMENT THAT MOVEMENT HAS DEMONSTRATED THE DESIRABILITY OF HAVING COMPREHENSIVE PLANS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMMERCIAL POSSIBILITIES OF CITIES THE LOCATION AND ARRANGEMENT OF PUBLIC BUILDINGS IN ACCORDANCE WITH DESIGNS THAT FOSTER BEAUTY AND HARMONY OF ARCHITECTURAL ARRANGEMENT THE MAKING OF PARK PRO VISIONS FOR THE GROWING POPULATION THE DESIGNING OF GOOD STREETS BOULEVARDS AND SEWER SYSTEMS AND SECURING ADEQUATE SYSTEMS OF WATER SUPPLY THESE PLANS TO ATTAIN THEIR FULL REALIZATION WITHOUT UNDUE BURDENS OF DEBT OR TAXATION AND WITHOUT LONG DELAYS AND THEIR RESULTING ADDED COSTS MUST SECURE THE COOPERATION OF CITY OFFICIALS THE MEMBERSHIP OF COMMERCIAL BODIES AND OF ALL OTHER CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS SO FAR ONE OF THE DESIRABLE RESULTS OF THE ADOPTION OF THE COMMISSION FORM OF GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN THE STIMULATION OF THE CITY PLANNING MOVEMENT IN THE CITIES ADOPTING THE SAME BUT WISE CITY PLANNING CANNOT BE ADOPTED WITHOUT A LONG LOOK AHEAD AND 801 I3ITHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY SCHEMES FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS WHICH WILL SET FORTH FOR EACH OF THOSE YEARS THE RELATION OF EXPENDITURES TO THE MEANS ADOPTED FOR PROVIDING THE MONEY FOR MEETING THE EXPENDITURES AND THE PRESEN TATION OF ANNUAL BUDGETS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE CITY PLAN FURTHER ANY WAY OF TREATING EXPENDITURES OF THE BUDGET AND THE MONEYS FOR MEETING THEM OTHER THAN THE ONE HERE OUTLINED UNDER ANY FORM OF GOVERNMENT WHETHER COMMISSION OR OTHERWISE LEADS INEVITABLY TO DEPARTMENTAL AND PERSONAL FAVORITISM IT LEADS TO RAISING MONEY FOR CERTAIN CLASSES OF EXPENDITURES IN ONE SECTION OF THE CITY BY ONE METHOD AND IN ANOTHER PART OF THE CITY BY A DIFFERENT ONE IN ONE SECTION THE COSTS OF A CERTAIN CLASS OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE FINANCED BY SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS WHILE IN ANOTHER THE SAME COSTS WILL BE BORNE BY GENERAL TAXES OR FROM THE PROCEEDS OF BOND ISSUES THESE ARE EVILS WHICH MAY BE FOUND IN ALL CITIES WITH THE OLD COUNCIL FORM OF GOVERNMENT AND WITH INCOM PLETE BUDGET STATEMENTS SIMILAR EVILS MUST INEVITABLY RESULT FROM THE SAME METHOD OF PREPARING BUDGETS IN COMMISSIONGOVERNED CITIES HENCE I REPEAT ONE AND THE MOST ESSENTIAL PROVISION OF BUDGETS IN COMMISSIONGOVERNED CITIES MUST BE THEIR COMPLETENESS AS STATEMENTS OF ALL PROPOSED EXPENDITURES AND OF THE SOURCES FROM WHICH IT IS PLANNED TO SECURE THE WHEREWITHAL FOR MEETING THOSE EXPENDITURES AND THE WISDOM OR FOLLY OF ALL PROPOSED FINANCIAL MEAS URES AND THEIR RELATION TO POPULAR WELFARE NOW AND IN THE FUTURE BUT COMPLETENESS IS NOT THE ONLY PROVISION THAT SHOULD AND MUST BE EMBODIED IN THE BUDGETS OF COMMISSIONGOVERNED CITIES TO MAKE THEM EFFECTIVE FOR GOOD GOVERNMENT THE BUDGET MUST BE ARRANGED IN A SYSTEMATIC AND ORDERLY MANNER SO THAT IT BECOMES A LUCID AND INTELLIGENT STATEMENT OF ALL THE PROPOSALS WHOSE SIGNIFICANCE ANY ONE AT ALL FAMILIAR WITH MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS CAN EASILY GRASP THE CLASSIFI CATION OF EXPENDITURES SHOULD BE ALONG FUNCTIONAL LINES WITH ITEMS IN GROUPS AND SUBGROUPS AND ARRANGED UNDER HEADS AND TITLES WITH WHICH EVERY ONE IS MORE OR LESS FAMILIAR THE BUDGET IS NO PLACE FOR EXHIBITING THE ATTAINMENTS OF THE ACADEMIC SCHOOL MAN THE CLASSIFICATION MUST BE ARRANGED TO SET FORTH THE RELATION OF THE PROPOSED EXPENDITURES TO THE ACTIVITIES OF THE CITY AS THE PEOPLE KNOW THOSE ACTIVITIES IT MUST GIVE GROUP AND SUBGROUP TOTALS AND SUBORDINATE DETAILS FOR ALL SUCH FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITIES AS THOSE FOR THE POLICE DEPARTMENT FIRE DEPARTMENT HEALTH DEPARTMENT SCHOOLS 802 132BUDGET PROVISIONS IN COMMISSIONGOVERNCD CITIES CHARITIES HOSPITALS HIGHWAYS SEWERS SANITATION ETC WITH WHICH THE PEOPLE ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITHOUT AN ANALYTICAL PRESENTATION OF PROPOSED EXPENDITURES ARRANGED ALONG FUNCTIONAL LINES AS ABOVE DESCRIBED CITY BUDGETS IN THE PAST HAVE OFTEN BEEN THE PLAYTHING OF CITY BOSSES TO FOOL AND THROW DUST IN THE PEOPLES EYES WITH AN ANALYTICAL PRESENTATION ALONG SCIENTIFICALLY CLASSIFIED LINES THAT FINANCIAL STATEMENT MAY READILY BE MADE A MOST POTENT FACTOR FOR GUARANTEEING AN ECONOMICAL EFFICIENT AND ALTOGETHER SATISFACTORY ADMINISTRATION OF MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS SUCH A CLASSIFICATION AND PRESENTATION OF PROPOSED EXPENDITURES IN THE BUDGET TO ACCOMPLISH THE RESULTS LAST STATED SHOULD BE ACCOM PANIED WITH AN EXHIBIT OF THE EXPENDITURES AND RECEIPTS OR REVENUES AND RECEIPT FROM INCREASING DEBT FOR THE PRECEDING YEAR STUDENTS OF MUNICIPAL ADMINISTRATION BEGAN THE AGITATION FOR UNIFORM ACCOUNTS AND REPORTS QUITE A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO SUCH ACCOUNTS AND REPORTS THOUGH ACCOMPLISHING MUCH AS AIDS TO GOOD GOVERNMENT HAVE FAILED OF REALIZING ALL THE GOOD RESULTS ANTICIPATED AND FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS THEY ARE ALWAYS STATEMENTS OF PAST TRANSACTIONS IF BY CHANCE THEY ARE THE RECORDS OF WASTE INEFFICIENCY OR GRAFT IN ADMINISTRATION UNLESS SUCH WASTE INEFFICIENCY AND GRAFT ARE STRIKING OR EVEN SHOCKING IN THEIR MAGNITUDE THE EXHIBIT OF THE SAME DOES NOT EXCITE A GREAT MEASURE OF POPULAR INTEREST THE REASON FOR THIS FACT IS FOUND IN THE POPULAR SPEECH WHEN SUCH EXHIBITS ARE CALLED A STORY OF DEAD HORSES IT IS A CLOSED CHAPTER IN THE POPULAR MIND THE PUBLIC ARE UNWILLING TO WASTE A GREAT DEAL OF TIME AROUND THE STABLE DOOR AFTER THE HORSE HAS BEEN STOLEN NOW WHILE THIS IS TRUE THE SAME EXHIBIT OF GOVERNMENTAL EXPENSES PRESENTED AS AN ACCOMPANI MENT OF A COMPARABLE EXHIBIT OF PROPOSED TRANSACTIONS THAT CAN BE PREVENTED BY A POPULAR PROTEST OR AIDED BY A POPULAR ADVOCACY WILL AT ONCE ATTRACT ATTENTION AS HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY ILLUSTRATED BY THE RESULTS OF THE BUDGET EXHIBIT IN NEW YORK AND OTHER CITIES IN RECENT YEARS THE ANALYTICAL EXHIBIT OF PROPOSED EXPENDITURES AND PROPOSALS FOR PROVIDING THE RESOURCES FOR MEETING THE SAME IS TO BE COMMENDED NOT ALONE AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR AWAKENING POPULAR INTEREST TO PREVENT GRAFT WASTEFULNESS AND INEFFICIENCY THAT ARE FOSTERED BY IMPROPER APPROPRIATIONS THEY ARE MORE TO BE COMMENDED BY REASON OF THEIR 803 I33THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY INTIMATE RELATION TO THE WISE AND NECESSARY INCREASE IN MUNICIPAL EXPENDITURES WHICH IS CALLED FOR EVERYWHERE IN RECENT YEARS BY THE FACT THAT CITIES ARE FINDING OUT HOW BY ENLARGED PUBLIC EXPENDITURES THEIR GOVERNMENTS CAN BE MADE TO ASSIST THE PEOPLE TO ADDED HEALTH COMFORT STRENGTH AND PLEASURE THAT OTHERWISE IS UNATTAINABLE FOR THEM THE ANALYTICAL BUDGET SUPPORTED BY ANALYTICAL REPORTS OF PAST EXPENDITURES PROVIDES THE BASIS FOR POPULAR JUDGMENT CONCERNING THE RELATIVE MERITS OR CLAIMS OF THE SEVERAL BRANCHES OF THE DEPART MENTAL SERVICE FOR INCREASED APPROPRIATIONS FROM PUBLIC MONEY AND SUCH BUDGETS UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES TEND TO PREVENT FAVORITISM FOR ANY ONE OR MORE BRANCHES OF THE SERVICE AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS AND ALSO TEND TO SECURE A PROPER ACCOUNT FOR EACH AND EVERY DEPARTMENT WHETHER ITS HEAD IS A GOOD OR A POOR LOBBYIST OR LOG ROLLER FOR GRANTS OF MONEY TO BE UTILIZED UNDER HIS DIRECTION THE FACTS REVIEWED LEAD THE WRITER TO HIS SECOND STATEMENT OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PROVISIONS TO BE INCLUDED IN BUDGETS OF COMMISSION GOVERNED CITIES A BUDGET ARRANGEMENT WITH EXPENDITURES CLASSIFIED ALONG FUNCTIONAL LINES EASILY UNDERSTOOD BY THE PEOPLE WITH THE FURTHER PROVISION THAT THESE CLASSIFIED STATEMENTS OF PROPOSED EXPEN DITURES MUST BE SUPPORTED BY SIMILAR STATEMENTS OF THE EXPENDITURES OF PAST YEARS IN THECLASSIFICATION OF THE EXPENDITURES OF THE BUDGET A COM PLETE SEPARATION SHOULD BE MADE OF THE PROPOSED AUTHORIZED EXPENSES OR COSTS OF GOVERNMENTAL OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE AND OUTLAYS OR EXPENDITURES FOR THE MORE OR LESS PERMANENT PROPERTIES EQUIPMENT AND IMPROVEMENTS WITH A LIFE IN USE OF MORE THAN ONE YEAR THIS SEPARATION OF PROPOSED AUTHORIZED EXPENSES FROM OUTLAYS SHOULD NOT BE CONFOUNDED AS IT TOO FREQUENTLY IS WITH A SPECIAL LEGAL ACCOUNTING FOR THE PROCEEDS OF LONG TERM BOND ISSUES THE CHARACTER OF AN EXPENDITURE IS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT AND APART FROM THE SOURCES OR METHODS BY WHICH THE MONEY IS OBTAINED TO MEET THE SAME OR THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PROPER ACCOUNTING OF SUCH MONEYS BOTH EXPENSES AND OUTLAYS MAY BE FINANCED BY MONEYS OBTAINED FROM REVENUES OR FROM BOND ISSUES AND THE AMOUNT FROM EACH CLASS OF EXPENDITURE WHICH IT IS PROPOSED BY THE BUDGET TO BE FINANCED FROM REVENUE AND FROM BOND SALES SHOULD BE SEPARATELY AND DISTINCTLY STATED OTHERWISE THE BUDGET WILL NOT BE A CLEARCUT STATE MENT OF THE RELATION OF COSTS OF GOVERNMENT TO METHODS OF FINANCING 804 I34BUDGET PROVISIONS IN COMMISSIONGOVERNED CITIES THESE COSTS AND WITHOUT SUCH STATEMENT NO SOUND JUDGMENT CAN BE PREDICATED UPON THE BUDGET WITH REFERENCE TO THE OUTCOME OF THE PROPOSED FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE YEAR IN THE FOREGOING PAGES THE WRITER HAS BRIEFLY OUTLINED THE FUNDA MENTAL PROVISIONS THAT MUST BE CONTAINED IN THE BUDGETS OF COMMISSIONGOVERNED CITIES IN ORDER THAT SUCH BUDGETS MAY ASSIST IN SECURING POPULAR CONTROL OVER MUNICIPAL ADMINISTRATION AND AID IN MAINTAINING ECONOMICAL WISE AND EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT THOSE PROVISIONS MAY BE BRIEFLY SUMMARIZED BY SAYING THAT TO ACCOMPLISH THE ENDS DESIRED BUDGETS MUST BE A COMPLETE EXHIBITS OF ALL PROPOSED EXPENDITURES AND OF SUG GESTED METHODS OF PROVIDING MONEY TO MEET THE SAME AS WELL AS STATEMENTS OF THE EFFECT OF SUCH EXPENDITURES UPON MUNICIPAL INDEBTEDNESS B STATEMENTS OF THE RELATION OF THE CURRENT EXPENDITURES TO BROAD AND COMPREHENSIVE PLANS FOR CITY BUILDING AND PROPOSED SCHEMES FOR FINANCING THOSE PLANS IN FUTURE AND THE RELATION OF ALL THESE PLANS TO PRESENT AND FUTURE TAXATION AND INDEBTEDNESS C STATEMENTS OF EXPENDITURES CLASSIFIED IN GROUPS AND SUB GROUPS AND SUBORDINATE DETAILS SO ARRANGED AS TO SHOW THE COM PARATIVE WISDOM OF EACH AND ALL AND THE COMPARATIVE MERITS OF EACH THESE STATEMENTS SHOULD BE SUPPORTED WITH OTHER STATEMENTS TO AID IN FORMING CORRECT JUDGMENTS CONCERNING THE ECONOMY AND EFFICIENCY OF CURRENT ADMINISTRATION BUT NEITHER THE MUNICIPAL FINANCIAL PROPOSALS SUCH AS ARE USUALLY FOUND IN BUDGETS NOR THE CLASSIFICATIONS DESCRIBED WILL SUFFICE TO ACCOMPLISH THE ENDS DESIREDTHE ATTAINMENT OF THE MOST DESIRABLE ADMINISTRATION OF CITY AFFAIRS THEY WILL NOT AFFORD A CITY COMMIS SION ALL THE DATA NEEDED FOR THEIR GUIDANCE SINCE BY THEM THEY CANNOT TELL WHETHER THE BUDGET ITSELF IS FRAMED ALONG INTELLIGENT LINES FURTHER IF THIS INFORMATION IS NOT AT THE COMMAND OF THE COMMIS SION IT CANNOT BE IMPARTED BY THEM TO THE PUBLIC THE BUDGET TO BE FRAMED ALONG INTELLIGENT LINES MUST BE BASED UPON A MASS OF INFOR MATION RELATING TO GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS AND THAT INFORMATION MUST BE PLACED AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC AS WELL AS UTILIZED BY THE COMMISSION THE INFORMATION NEEDED FOR THIS PURPOSE MAY BE BRIEFLY SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS I STATEMENTS OF THE EXPENSES OF A SERIES OF PRIOR YEARS SO CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO FUNCTION AS TO DISCLOSE THE ACTUAL AND RELATIVE 805 I35THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY COST OF EVERY GOVERNMENTAL ACTIVITY FOR THOSE YEARS SUCH STATEMENTS BEING SUPPLEMENTED BY STATISTICS AND OTHER EXHIBITS SHOWING THE RELATIVE ECONOMY AND EFFICIENCY OF EVERY BRANCH OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMPARING ONE BRANCH WITH

TRUST AND OTHER SPECIAL FUNDS 2 STATEMENTS OF PAST OUTLAYS FOR THE MORE PERMANENT PROPER TIES AND PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS OF THE CITY AND OF THE APPROXIMATE VALUE OF SUCH PROPERTIES ETC OR THE COST OF REPRODUCING THEM IN PRESENT CONDITION SUCH STATEMENTS SHOULD BE SO ARRANGED AS TO SET FORTH THE AMOUNTS EXPENDED DURING EACH OF A SERIES OF YEARS FOR EVERY OBJECT OF OUTLAY AND THE AMOUNTS OF MONEY OBTAINED FOR MEETING THESE OUTLAYS FROM BOND ISSUES AND FROM GENERAL AND TRUST OR OTHER SPECIAL REVENUES 3 STATEMENTS OF THE RELATION OF NET FUNDED DEBT WHICH IS GROSS FUNDED DEBT LESS SINKING FUND

FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY IS NOT FAVORED AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS 5 STATEMENTS FOR ASERIES OF YEARS OF THE CURRENT CONTRIBUTIONS FROM REVENUE TO SINKING FUNDS AND FOR OTHER METHODS OF AMORTIZING FIXED DEBTS

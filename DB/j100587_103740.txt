THE DIFFERENCE OF THEIR SEXES BY THE REVEREND MR DERHAM F R S PREBENDARY OF WINDSOR IN THE BEGINNING OF JULY LAST 1723 HAVING FRE QUENT OCCASION TO BE ON THE TOP OF OUR COLLEGIATE CHAPEL IN WINDSOR CASTLE I OBSERVED MANY WASPS FLY ING ABOUT IT AND PARTICULARLY FREQUENTING A COVERING OF DEAL BOARDS AND THE PIECES OF TIMBER LYING ON THE LEADS I TOOK NOTICE THAT MOST OF THESE WASPS WERE OF A LARGER SORT THAN USUAL AND THOUGHT THEY CAME THITHER TO GNAW THE WOOD AND TO CARRY IT AWAY IN MOUTHFULS TO BUILD THEIR NESTS THE ARTIFICE OF WHICH I HAVE TAKEN NOTICE OF IN MY PHYS THEOL PARTICULAR LY B 4 CH 11 NOTE 21 AND CHAP 13 NOT 12 BUT HAVING CAUGHT SOME OF THEM AND AMONGST THE REST A LARGE QUEENWASP WHICH SORT OF WASP BY THE BY NEVER ENGAGES IN ANY LABOURS OF THE COLONY I BE GAN TO BE MORE STRICT IN MY OBSERVATIONS AND ON JU LY 6 I OBSERVED A CLUSTER OF ONLY THREE WASPS CLOSELY EMBRACING EACH OTHER ONE OF WHICH WAS A LARGE FE MALE54 MALE WASP THE OTHER TWO OF A LESSER SORT THIS MORE EXCITED MY CURIOSITY AND SOON AFTER I FOUND 8 OR 10 WASPS CLOSELY HANGING TOGETHER AND DIVERS OTHER SUCH LIKE PARCELS IN THE MIDST OF ALL WHICH WAS CONSTANTLY A QUEENWASP AND ONLY ONE THE REST BEING ALWAYS OF A DIFFERENT SORT FROM EITHER THE QUEEN OR THE COMMON WASPS WHICH GAVE ME A SU SPICION OF THEIR BEING MALE AND FEMALE AND THERE FORE EXAMINING ANOTHER COMPANY OF THEM WITH GREA TER STRICTNESS I FOUND THE QUEENWASP IN COITU WITH ONE OF THE OTHER WASPS SO CLOSELY JOINED TAIL TO TAIL THAT IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE THEY WERE PARTED AFTER THIS I CAUGHT ALL THE WASPS I COULD ON THE TOP OF OUR CHAPEL BUT COULD NOT SEE ONE OF THE COM MON LABOURING WASPS AMONG THEM BUT ALL WERE FOR THE MOST PART MALE WASPS WITH NOW AND THEN A QUEEN OR FEMALE AMONG THEM AND SHE GENERALLY IN COITU AND NOW FROM THIS HISTORY OF MY OBSERVATION IT APPEARS THAT THERE ARE THREE SORTS OF WASPS THE QUEENS OR FEMALES THE KINGS OR MALES AND THE COMMON LABOURINGWASPS EACH OF THEM VERY DI STINCT THE QUEEN OR FEMALEWASP BY MANY CALLED THE KINGWASP IS MUCH LONGER IN THE BODY AND LARGER THAN ANY OTHER WASP THE MALE WASPS ARE LESSER THAN THE QUEENS BUT AS MUCH LONGER AND LARGER THAN THE COMMON WASPSAS THE QUEEN IS LONGER AND LARGER THAN THESE THESE MALES ALSO HAVE NO STINGS WHICH THE QUEENS AND COMMON WASPS ALL HAVE AND THESE ARE THOSE WHICH MOUFET SAITH AUTHORS CALL  AND TAKE TO BE FEMALES ALTHOUGH HE IS OF ANOTHER OPINION IMAGINING ALL WASPS TO HAVE STINGS UPON HIS EXAMINING A WASPS NEST55 NEST AT HAM ANNO 1587 IN WHICH HE FOUND NO WASPS WITHOUT A STING BUT I WONDER HOW THAT CU RIOUS ENQUIRER MISSED OF THESE STINGLESS MALE WASPS SURELY HE WAS TOO HASTY IN HIS EXAMINATION AND NOT BEING AWARE OF THE DIFFERENCE HE THOUGHT THE MALES WHICH ARE BUT FEW IN NUMBER TO THE LABOURING WASPS WERE THE SAME AND HAD STINGS AS WELL AS THE REST OR ELSE HE MADE HIS ENQUIRY AT A TIME WHEN PERHAPS THE MALES HAD DESERTED THE NEST WHICH PROBABLY THEY MAY DO AS THE MALE OR DRONEBEES ARE FORCED TO DO OR ELSE THE YEAR 1587 IN WHICH MOUFET MADE HIS OBSERVATION MIGHT PRODUCE FEWER WASPS AT LEAST FEWER MALE WASPS THAN THIS LAST SUMMER OF 1723 DID IN WHICH I MADE MY OBSERVATION WHICH WAS OBSERVED TO HAVE A GREATER ABUNDANCE OF WASPNESTS THAN HATH BEEN KNOWN IN MANY YEARS AND IN ALL THE NESTS THAT I SEARCHED INTO I CONSTANTLY FOUND MALE WASPS EITHER MANY OR FEW ACCORDING TO THE SIZE OF THE NEST AND NUMBER OF WASPS THEREIN AND THE PART OF THE NEST WHERE THESE MALES ARE BRED OR AT LEAST WHERE I FOUND THEM MOST TO RESIDE WAS CHIEFLY THE TWO UPPERMOST CELLS OR PARTINGS BETWEEN THE COMBS BUT ONE BUT TO RETURN TO THE DISTINCTION OF OUR MALE WASPS ANOTHER THING BY WHICH THEY MAY BE KNOWN FROM OTHER WASPS IS THEIR ANTENNAE OR HORNS WHICH ARE LONGER AND LARGER THAN EITHER THOSE OF THE QUEEN OR COMMON WASPS AND WITH THEM THEY SEEM IN RUN NING TO FEEL MORE THAN THE OTHERS DO BUT THE GRAND AND CHIEF DIFFERENCE ARE THE PARTS OF GENERATION OF THESE MALE WASPS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM OTHER WASPS WHICH I DISSECTED WITH ALL CARE AND SHALL GIVE A DESCRIPTION OF AS WELL AS I CAN WITHOUT FIGURES WHICH I COULD NOT GET DRAWN PARTLY FOR WANT OF A DESIGNER AND PARTLY FROM MY REMOVALS BETWEEN WINDSOR AND UPMINSTER IN WHICH TIME THE 2 PARTS56 PARTS ARE SO DRIED UP OR EATEN WITH MITES THAT THEY CANNOT BE DRAWN TILL THE RETURN OF WASP TIME FOR THE DISCOVERY OF THESE PARTS IF THE ALVUS BE PRESSED AN HORNY OR SHELLLIKE PART WILL BE THRUST OUT OF A SHINING BLACK COLOUR WHICH CONSISTS OF TWO PARTS LIKE SHELLS SOMEWHAT RESEMBLING THE CASTAGNETS USED IN DANCING AT THE EXTREME PART OF EACH OF WHICH GROWS AN HOOK SOMEWHAT LIKE THOSE OF THE EARWIGS TAIL BUT MUCH LESSER IN THE MIDDLE BE TWEEN THESE HOOKS APPEAR THREE PARTS THE MID DLEMOST OF WHICH IS A STIFF BROWN TUBE VERY CURIOUSLY MADE WITH THE FOREPART LIKE A SPOON OR LAD E AND THE OTHER END WITHIN THE BODY IS NEATLY BRANCHED AND BRACED TO EACH SIDE WITHIN THE TWO INFERREDSHELLSINFERRED I SPAKE OF A LITTLE ABOVE WHICH BRANCHING IS A  OR SWELLING LIKE THAT OF A DOGS PIZZLE AND PERHAPS SERVES FOR THE SAME USE IF THIS TUBE IS AS I IMA GINE IT IS THE PENIS OF THE WASP ON EACH SIDE THIS PENIS LIES A STIFF PART IN NUM BER TWO BRANCHED AT THE TOP WITH SOMEWHAT LIKE HAIRS GIVING THEM THE RESEMBLANCE OF BRUSHES AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH ARE TWO CURIOUS BLACK CELLS WITH AN OPENING ON ONE SIDE LIKE THAT OF THE CONCHA VENERIS WITH SMALL WHITISH HAIRS GROWING ON ONE EDGE THEREOF WHAT THE USE OF THESE TWO BRUSHLIKE MEMBERS MAY BE I KNOW NOT UNLESS IT BE TO STRENGTHEN AND SUP PORT OR DIRECT THE PENIS IN COITU OR PROVOKE THEREIN BEHIND ALL THESE PARTS WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED MORE WITHIN THE BODY LIES A LONG CONTORTED WHITE VESSEL WHICH AT FIRST I TOOK TO BE THE REAL PENIS PE NETRATING THE LADLELIKE TUBE I SPAKE OF BUT UPON FARTHER EXAMINATION I RATHER TAKE IT TO BE THE SPER MATICK VESSEL AS TO THE USE OF THE TWO LITTLE HOOKS I MENTIOND AT THE END OF THE UROPYGIUM OR SHELLS I TAKE THEM 1 TO57 TO BE TO CATCH HOLD OF THE FEMALES PODEX AND TO DIRECT AND ASSIST THE PENETRATION OF THE PENIS IN COITU AS FOR THE PARTS OF GENERATION IN THE QUEEN OR FEMALEWASPS NOTHING WAS TO BE SEEN SO REMARKABLE AS IN THE MALE BUT THOSE PARTS ARE VERY LIKE WHAT WE SEE IN THE COMMON LABOURINGWASPS INDEED WITH THE MOST ACCURATE OBSERVATIONS I COULD MAKE WITH MY MICROSCOPES I COULD NOT PERCEIVE ANY DIFFERENCE AT ALL FOR WHICH REASON I SUPPOSE IT IS THAT MOST OF THE WRITERS UPON WASPS AND BEES HAVE BEEN VERY CON FUSED AND WAVERING ABOUT THE SEXES OF THESE TWO TRIBES OF INSECTS IT WOULD BE ENDLESS TO CITE THE AUTHORS AND THEIR OPINIONS ESPECIALLY CONCERNING THE BEETRIBE I THINK SWAMMERDAM A WHO AS HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THAT REJECTED EQUIVOCAL GENERA TION SO WAS ONE OF THE MOST JUDICIOUS WRITERS OF IN SECTS THAT HIS OPINION I SAY IS THE MOST JUST VIZ THAT OF BEES THERE ARE THREE SORTS VIZ 1 REX AUT VERIUS REGINA SIQUIDEM SEQUIORIS SEXUS EST 2 FU CI QUI MASCULI PROPRIE SUNT 3 APES OPERARIAE QUARUM SEXUM DISTINGUERE NON POSSUMUS CUM IN IIS NEC MASCULAS NEC

JOH VAN HORNE C AS FOR WHAT IS RELATED BY ARISTOTLE PLINY VIRGIL OR ANY OTHER ANCIENT AUTHORS OR BY OUR MORE NU MEROUS MODERNS CONCERNING THE PRODUCTION OF WASPS OUT OF HORSES OR BEES OUT OF OXEN OR YOUNG BULLOCKS AS ALSO OF THEIR POLITY THEIR EMPEROURS KINGS DUKES AND COMMON SUBJECTS THEIR EXACT DISCIPLINE AND JUSTICE VOL XXXIII K THEIR A SWAM HIST INSECT P 9258 THEIR STRICT TEMPERANCE AND OTHER VIRTUES WITH A GREAT DEAL MORE OF SUCH LIKE STUFF THIS IS SO VERY WHIMSICAL THAT IT IS NOT WORTH WHILE TO TAKE ANY FARTHER NOTICE OF IT BUT THERE IS A STORY SERIOUSLY TOLD BY MOUFET B THAT DESERVES OUR OBSERVATION VIZ THAT IN THE YEAR 1582 BEING ON THE HIGHEST RIDGES OF THE CARTMELHILLS I SUPPOSE IN LANCASHIRE HE SAW AMONG THE ROCKS TWO SPECIES OF WASPS DESPERATELY FIGHTING THAT THEY DIFFERED ONLY IN MAGNITUDE THAT THE LARGER TRUSTED TO THEIR STRENGTH AND THE LESSER TO THEIR NUM BERS THERE BEING SIX OF THE LESSER ENGAGED AGAINST ONLY ONE OF THE LARGER SIZE AND THAT THE BATTLE WAS NOT IN THE AIR BUT AMONG THE GRASS AND LASTED FOR SOME HOURS IN THE HOTEST SUN NOT BEING AT AN END IN TWO OR THREE HOURS SPACE THE CAUSE OF THIS ENGAGEMENT MOUFET THINKS WAS THAT THE GREAT WASPS ARE WONT TO ROB THE LESSER OF THEIR HONEY AND YOUNG OR DO THEM SOME OTHER SUCH LIKE MISCHIEF AND THE LESSER BEING VERY REVENGEFUL AND NATURALLY FULL OF COURAGE DID OUTBRAVE EVEN MARS HIMSELF IN ASSAULTING THEIR ENE MY BUT THIS ENGAGEMENT I TAKE TO BE SUCH ANOTHER AS THAT WHICH I HAVE GIVEN THE HISTORY OF NAMELY ONE UNDER THE CONDUCT OF VENUS NOT OF MARS AND AS THERE IS NO DOUBT TO BE MADE OF ITS BEING SUCH AND THAT THE ENGAGEMENT SEEN BY MOUFET WAS ON THE HIGHEST TOPS OF CARTMEL IN SUMMIS CARTMELI MONTIUM JUGIS AS THAT I SAW WAS ON THE VERY TOP OF OUR CHAPEL IT MAY DESERVE OBSERVATION WHETHER THE WASPS EVER COPULATE IN LOWER PLACES OBVIOUS TO DISTURBANCE AND EVERY ONES EYE OR ONLY ON SUCH EMINENCIES WHERE THEY CAN BE MORE OUT OF SIGHT AND CONSEQUENTLY IN GREATER SAFETY AND IF AT ANY TIME THEY SHOULD BE FOUND IN COPULATION THEY MAY ALL B MOUSET THEAT INSECT L 1 C 859 ALL WITH SAFETY BE SEIZED WITH THE NAKED HAND PRO VIDED IT CAN BE SECURED AGAINST THE QUEENWASP WHICH IS THE ONLY ONE IN THE COMPANY THAT IS PRO VIDED WITH A STING FOR A CLOSE OF THESE OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE SEXES OF WASPS I SHALL TAKE NOTICE OF MOUFETS EXPERIMENT WHICH I TRYD VIZ IF YOU TAKE A WASP BY THE FEET AND SUFFER HER TO BUZ THAT THOSE WASPS WHICH HAVE NO STINGS WILL FLY TO HER BUT NOT ANY THAT HAVE STINGS WHICH SOME HE SAITH USE AS AN ARGUMENT TO PROVE THAT SOME WASPS ARE MALES SOME FEMALES THIS EX PERIMENT I WAS MINDED TO TRY WITH A QUEENWASP MORE ESPECIALLY NOT KNOWING BUT THAT WASPS PARTI CULARLY THE MALES MIGHT BE AS FOND OF THEIR QUEENS AS THE BEES ARE OF THEIRS WHO WILL NOT FORSAKE THEM BUT WILL LIVE AND DIE WITH THEM BUT I DID NOT FIND IT TO SUCCEED SO AMONG THE WASPS FOR ALTHOUGH I PUT SOME QUEENWASPS AND OTHERS ALSO NEAR THE EN TRANCE OF SOME LARGE WASPNESTS YET I DID NOT SEE ANY FLOCK NEAR THEM ONLY NOW AND THEN ONE OF THE COMMON WASPS FOR A LITTLE WHILE TO SEE THEIR FELLOW CONFINED BUT INDEED THE QUEENWASPS WHICH I CON FINED WERE WEAK AND DID NOT BUZ LONG AS ALSO THE TIME OF COPULATION WAS PROBABLY PAST IT BEING AU GUST 12 WHEN I TRYD THE EXPERIMENT K 2 V OB

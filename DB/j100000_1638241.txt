FORD1 THE RAINEY AFRICAN EXPEDITION MR EDMUND HELLER who represented the Smithsonian Institution on Mr Paul J Raineys African Expedition writes from Kisumu British East Africa January 26 1912 that the expedition has been completed but that a delay has been caused in the ship ment of specimens collected by Mr Rainey and himself due to the lack of porters trans portation facilities etc The collection which arrived at Nairobi two weeks prior to the date of his letter has been packed and forwarded by him to the Smithsonian Institution While waiting for a steamer from Mombasa Mr IHeller put in a couple of months in making collections at various stations of the Uganda Railroad including some districts not touched by the Smithsonian Expedition under Colonel Roosevelt and also about Lake Victoria Nyanza By this means he has been able to add many species to the Smithsonian collec tion as well as to finish a really complete sur vey of the mammals of British East Africa He will probably spend a few weeks at the British Museum and at the Berlin Museum in comparing and identifying some of the specimens collected The trip was most satis factory in every way and Mr Heller estimates that the collection will rival that made by the Smithsonian African Expedition under Mr Roosevelt in 1909 and 1910 In all there are about 700 large mammal skins in salt 4000 small mammal skins and a large number of 1 Assistant professor of mineralogy in the Shef field Scientific School of Yale University and curator of the Brush Mineral Collection 411N S VOL XXXV No 898 birds and reptiles most of them coming from regions not visited by the previous expedition while some are from remote localities never before visited by naturalists After the com pletion of his studies in Europe Mr Heller will return to Washington to complete his re port on the mammals of British East Africa THE PACIFIC ASSOCIATION OF SCIEN TIFIC SOCIETIES THE second annual meeting of the Pacific Association of Scientific Societies will be held at Stanford University oa April 4 5 6 1912 Sessions will be held this year on one or more of the above days by the following eight societies The Technical Society of the Pacific Coast The Cordilleran Section of the Geological Society of America The Seismological Society of America Pacific Coast Branch of the American Historical Association The Pacific Slope Association of Economic Entomologists Pacific Paleontological Society The Biologial Society of the Pacific The California Section of the American Chem ical Society There will also meet with the Association the LeConte Club and the Mathematical So ciety of the Pacific Coast Friday evening will be used generally for dinners and banquets and on Saturday even ing will be held the general session of the as sociation President Jordan will give the ad dress of welcome and among the readers of papers will be Professor A C Lawson Uni versity of California Professor George Hempl Stanford University and Director W W Campbell of the Lick Observatory The Pacific Association of Scientific So cieties was organized in 1910  to promote co operation among the constituent societies It is to make possible the getting together of a number of smaller isolated societies an nually at the same time and place The ad ministrative machinery of the association is an Executive Committee composed of the presidents and secretaries or their representa tives of the constituent societies The prin cipal business of this committee is to suggest time and place of meeting and make arrange ments for such meetings Nine Coast Societies became members the first year The Technical Society of the Pacific coast The Cordilleran Section of the Geological So ciety of America The Seismological Society of America Pacific Coast Branch of the American His torical Association The Pacific Slope Association of Economic Entomologists Pacific Coast Paleontological Society The Philological Society of the Pacific Coast The Cooper Ornithological Club California Academy of Sciences The second year two more societies became members The Biological Society of the Pacific The California Section of the American Chem ical Society The present officers of the association are Chairman of the Executive Committee Mr Otto von Geldern Vicechairman Professor George D Louderback Secretarytreasurer Professor J N Bowman The first meeting of the association was held at the University of California on March 31April 1 1911 The different societies ac cepting the suggested time and place held their sessions on the campus on Saturday evening the general session of the association convened in California Iall At this session addresses and papers were given by Chairman Otto von Geldern President Benjamin Ide Wheeler President David Starr Jordan Pro fessor Vernon Kellogg Mr George W Dickie and Professor Bernard Moses The same gen eral plan will be followed this year at the sec ond annual meeting at Stanford University The work of the various secretaries is greatly facilitated by the committee on arrangements appointed by President Jordan and composed of Professors Townley Heath and Burlin game SCIENTIFIC

University Press I920 pp II9 320 This slender volume is of interest to American teachers for two reasons first for tlle information it gives directly or by implica tion upon the state of historyteaching in England and secondly for the practical quality of its criticisms and suggestions so wholly un affected by the airs and attitudes of the professional pedagogue Mr Hasluck speaks of a concentric programme according to which the full course of Eng lish history should be gone over each year political coniflicts one year wars and foreign policy another year constitutional developments another year He remarks that a continuous chrono logical treatment with the different threads interwoven still finds greater favor He inclines to use the concenitric metlhod within the limits of a single period for example i603i689 which would be the work of one term It is not a little curious that he feels obliged to argue that English boys should study something besides English history His own plan calls for about a dozen lessons in general on European history each term during three years for the older pupils boys of from fourteen to sixteen years of age The United States since the Revolutionary War receives a modest assignment Our national development glanced at from the easterni shores of the Atlantic does not take on the proportions we ordinarily ascribe to it His words are worth quoting  It seems  he says that we should have omitted something of importance if we neglected to give two or three lessons to the subject of the United States and their problems As regards selection of material Mr Hasluck does not believe in making the lessons too entertaining He thinks the  reaction against the grinding methods of our fathers has been excessive This does not implv an oldfashioned textbook treat ment He advocates the use of exercises in the sources although in his opinion the sourcebook enthusiasts have gone too far He emphasizes one characteristic of efficient work of this kind which is too often forgotten the presence in the hands of each student not only before the class exercises but during the class hour of a copy of the particular document or group of documents His stuggestions also for the utiliza tion of local hiistory are valuable H E B Archaic England ant Essay in Deciphering Prehistory fromit Mcga lithic Monuments Earthwarks Customs Coinis PlaceNames and Faerie Superstitionts By Harold Bayley London Chapman and Hall Ltd Philadelphia J B Lippincott Company I920 pp Viii 894 750 If one cotuld believe that Mr Bayley intended his book on Archaic England as a satire on the writings of a certain class of histortians and philolo354 Reviews of Books gists who seem able to reach important conclusions without much regard to the evidence his work would be comprehensible But a satirist rarely finds it necessary to extend his purpose over more than eighthundred large pages moreover the reading of a very few pages brings out the fact that the author intends that his account shall be taken as serious history Mr Bayleys work is primarily a study in folklore It is a discus sion of such topics as Gog and Magog Puck Oberon the Man in the Moon the White Horse and a host of others of the same kinship The author seems to believe strongly in the essential unity of the human race and human culture and that traces of this original unity can be found in folklore in placenames and in popular customs rites and ceremonies In this belief there is doubtless a great deal of important truth but in his effort to discover and present this truth Mr Bayley employs a method that makes the sifting process an impossible one He seems to have framed a principle that if any two words sound alike they are the same word no matter what may be the accident of origin If this principle is once accepted the rest is easy To begin with Mr Bayley believes that the English race speech and culture are fundamentally British and not AngloSaxon He rejoices in the Norman conquest through which the temporary ascendancy of German kultur was finally and irrevocably destroyed p 24 The English language he holds has descended in direct ancestry from the Welsh or Kymbric p 79  Mr Bayley is therefore largely occupied with Celtic lore terms and placenames He finds an evident connection between Janus the Roman divinity and  the innumerable Jones of Wales p 92 between the Greek hero Achilles and Achill in County Mayo p 82 between the Balkan Albania and the Scotch Albany p 84 and finally between Yankee and jonnock an English dialect ad jective meaning true straightforward and the like p 97 The term Kymry he explains as meaning the followers of King Bri p 3I0 Gretchen  resolves into Great Chun or Great Mighty Chief p 302 Mr Bayley is not so sure of the identification of Elgin with the Irish Hooligans p 290 or of Jehu with the exclamation Gehoh Gehoh which carmen use to their horses p 282 but he is quite clear that Yule was originally ye all p I32 It is scarcely necessary to illustrate the authors method further Examples might be presented in great numbers but enough have been given to prove that the publishers are correct in advertising Archaic England as a  remarkable book  L M L Feudal Cambridgeshire By William Farrer DLitt Cambridge University Press I920 pp xi 354 I200 The purpose of Dr Farrer in compiling the information contained in this calendar is to aid the student in the determination of the baronial honorial and manorial history of Cambridgeshire The calendar arranges the vills of the county conMinor Notices 355 veniently in their respective hundreds and gives for each vill a number of references from various printed sources sufficient to indicate in general its descent through various fees in the period from Domesday Book through the thirteenth century or its permanence as part of one fee It was probably necessary that the references should be summaries in English and not quotations from the original but there is a somewhat disquieting warning in the introduction that not all references to a given vill from the source chosen are included The speedy identification of fees will be undoubtedly facilitated by a careful work of this character which has entailed much labor and the pedigrees of baronial houses of which a number are given will prove very useful The calendar will contribute to the important studies of baronies and honors which are yet to be written In his extremely brief introduction Dr Farrer makes no attempt unfortunately for the student of history to draw his own conclusions from the material he has so patiently collected with regard to the difficult definition of  honor  or  barony  It is obvious that in a work of this kind there must be some definite limitations of the number of authorities included The student may rea sonably desire to know the exact considerations determining the com pilers choice of material within the wide field open to him and the exact works consulted The division between printed and unprinted is not logical although it may be convenient or even necessary Even within the restricted field of printed material however Dr Farrers choice is insufficiently designated The statement regarding sources in the intro duction is surprisingly brief and general especially for thirteenthcen tury material and there is no bibliography The student can never be sure what authorities other than those cited have been consulted for any particular vill This defect might be easily remedied to the greater usefulness of the work in the similar compilations which are we are told projected for several other counties There is occasionally more over an indefiniteness with regard to authorities especially for state ments made in the footnotes The inclusion of Norfolk vills in Wis beach and the failure to indicate which of the multiform possibilities of Wisbeach as hundred vill manor castle or barton is meant is a case in point Surely Elena la Zuche held sokelond  and not fokelond equated in the index with folkland in Swavesey see Rot Hund II 370 The full index of persons and places will prove of great service N NEILSON Belgium the Mlaking of a Nation By H Vander Linden Professor of History in the University of Liege Translated by Sybil Jane Ox ford Clarendon Press I920 PP 356 325 It was natural enough that Belgian scholars forced into foreign environment by the German in vasion should turn their attention to their own history as a whole no matter what their special field had been Others less well equipped also plunged headlong into the Belgian story and large has been the crop of356 Reviews of Books minor works works possessing as a rule but little significance as con tributions to Belgic history Monographs are valuable if their scope be limited but any small volurne covering centuries has the defects of its qualities In this instance the reader might have gained had the author limited himself to a consideration of modern Belgium even though his outline of the past has been sketched simply with a view to the dominating influences One would have liked him to treat the later periods with the delightful intimacy of men and times which he displays in his discussion of the bull of demarcation of Alexander VI That article published in the October number of this review I9I6 is a won derful example of a power to be as familiar with a past phase as one might be with current events It is an inspiring exposition of a justly original point of viewa vivid sidelight turned on an important transac tion a light kindled by the writers researches into colonial expansion As regards this volume it really seems as though M Vander Linden might have omitted the first I52 pages of his historic review giving a reference to the Belgian Democracy of Pirenne with whom he is in sub stantial agreement as to the theory that internationalism is the essential keynote of Belgian nationality The chronological narrative is too con densed to be vital The later chapters are richer in individuality and indicate what the author can do in charactersketches The intensive provincialism that persisted throughout the Austrian regime the Catholic influence in political situations the difference between French and Belgic definitions of liberty during the Revolution are acutely outlined as well as the good intentions of the Congress of Vienna and their failure in regard to the kingdom of the Netherlands The most readable chapters are however those dealing with the years I831I9I4 giving the evolu tion of the present realm from an agricultural to an industrial state a state burdened with capitalist proletarian and linguistic problems The differentiation of these problems from similar ones existing in other lands is particularly well put as is also the peculiar character of Belgian Liberalism In spite of all the incongruous elements seething in a small space there is a confidence in the existence of a peculiar Belgic national strength May that prove to be the case Het Voorspel van den Eersten Engelschen Oorlog Door Johan E Elias In two volumes The Hague Martinus Nijhoff 1920 pp Viii i85 vi 235 and 5 maps io fl A complete history of Dutch commer cial hegemony in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries would be enti tled to fill many volumes and would comprehend much of the economic history of Europe in that period It is to be hoped that the folios will some day be written but in the meantime students will be grateful for this synthesized and condensed survey of what the author has called not very descriptively Preliminaries to the First English War Mr Elias fixes upon the English War as the crisis when Dutch mercantile imperialism unbearably strained in the effort to maintain its monopoliesMflinor Notices 3 5 7 and supremacies in all parts of the world first gave groundnot so much before its English rival as before the new conditions of a new age From this point of view the entire economic development of the provinces is a preface to the war as the history of France is a preface to the Revolution Mr Elias has shorn away in so far as it was possi ble religious political and diplomatic ramifications and in another work he has dealt with the Dutch navy but even thus limited his task was extensive and intricate In its accomplishment he was greatly served by the numerous careful monographs on all aspects of the Republics Golden Age which stand to the credit of Dutch scholarship The book is then not the product of original investigations but of exhaustive reading and correlation of the masses of material available in print Although the author has been most scrupulous in furnishing references the absence of a bibliography is regrettable The first volume tells the story of the origin growth and integration of Dutch economic supremacy in Europe There is a chapter on com merce and the fisheries onean omnivorous but highly interesting chap teron shipbuilding the carrying trade industry labor and finance one on English commercial development and one expounding the rival Dutch and English theories of mare liberum and mare clausum The second volume describes Dutch expansion in Asia Africa and the Americas Although the English rivalry is emphasized throughout the writers concern is primarily with the history of his own land and his treatment of English affairs is designedly summary and incidental In reading the book one is strongly impressed by the fact that  peace ful penetration has not changed its methods greatly since the seven teenth century It meant then as it means now energy initiative ruthlessness long views large profits capital piling up credit unfolding industrial organization and combination labor sweated here restriction of output for the sake of

Timies to I857 By G E Cory Professor in Rhodes University Col lege Grahamstown South Africa Vol III New York and London Longmans Green and Company 1919 PP xiv 474 9oo The pub lication of this volume marks the third stage in an undertaking which the author began in I893 two years after his arrival from England to assume a professorship in Rhodes University College Grahamstown South Africa The two preceding volumes appearing successively in I9IO and I9I3 have already been noticed in this review However it is perhaps worth while to point out once more that the main titleThe Rise358 Reviews of Books of Southt Africais misleading though the subtitle A History of the Origin of South African Colonization and of its Development towards the East from the earliest Times to I857  indicates more correctly the very special character of the work As a matter of fact the third volume purporting to cover the period from I834 to I840 is with the exception of an excellent chapter on slavery and its suppression in South Africa devoted exclusively to the Kaffir War of I835 its origin course and aftermath Allowing for the restricted scope of the treatment both in time and area the author has made a valuable contribution of far more general interest than the particular incidents he actually describes Following his previous practice he supplements a careful study of the records by material drawn from interviews with early settlers and their descendants thus reproducing most vividly the frontier life of a bygone age with all its adventurousness and hardship More important still while aiming to be unbiassed he presents a vigorous brief for the colonists as against  Mr Mother Country the London Missionary Society and the policy for which they stood in deal ing with the nativesthe policy of lenient drifting and amiable persua sion as contrasted with the more drastic and aggressive methods advo cated by the frontiersmen This sharp conflict of policy together with acute differences of opinion regarding the respective responsibility of white and colored folk for the dreary succession of border wars is one of the most persistent problems of the greater part of South African history to say nothing of a not inconsiderable portion of British colonial history in many other parts of the farflung empire Professor Corv leaves the reader in no doubt as to where he stands It is always an easy matter he remarks for those at a safe distance to say what should have been done in the time of danger and not having suffered loss themselves to counsel mercy forbearance and forgiveness in those wlho have This is all very true indeed one may go further and admit that  indiscriminate and mistaken zeal on the part of benevolent people in Great Britain  contributed to many subsequent disorders and disas ters and certainly little or nothing can be said for somnolent and vacil lating secretaries like Lord Glenelg who was ultimately removed for incompetence On the other hand fear of criticism from the humani tarian element among the British public has always been a wholesome check on savage and irresponsible administration happily limiting the number of Governor Eyres and General Dyers But Governor Durban and Colonel later Sir Harry G Smith were apparently not of the brutal sort and were undoubtedly the victims of hysterical and inept meddling ARTHUR LYON CROSS Johann Peter Friedrich Ancillon und Kroitprinz Friedrich Wilhelm IV von Preussenz Von Paul Haake Historische Bibliothek heraus gegeben von der Redaktion der Historischen Zeitschrift 42 BandMinor Notices 359 Munich and Berlin Oldenbourg 1920 pp i8o M 20 The author of this book seeks to rescue Ancillon from the unfriendly interment in the AUgemeine Deutsche Biographie to which he was consigned by an anonymous hand He gives an excellent analysis of the ideas of this once famous preacher philosopher writer tutor and statesmanand of the strong antiliberal influence which he exerted upon Frederick Wil liam III and upon the crown prince whose guide he became in i8io His work is largely based on hitherto unused letters between Ancillon and the crown prince and he wisely lets the letters largely speak for themselves Ancillon born in I766 of a Prussian French Huguenot family was a child of the Age of Enlightenment His admiration for Frederick the Great and the system of government which he represented was unlimited He happened to be at Versailles during the Tennis Court Oath and the events which he witnessed in France turned him violently against all written constitutions and popular sovereignty On his return to Berlin he attracted so much attention by his eloquent sermons to the French community there that he was appointed in i8io as tutor to the crown prince who became king in I840 He was more than a mere tutor He speedily became to the crown prince a beloved guide philosopher and friendan intimate relationship which lasted for more than a quarter of a century and was broken only by his death in I837 But the clay in the potters hand was not of the best Even as a youth Frederick William IV often betrayed signs of that unbalanced ecstasy and fantasy which became more marked with age Nein u Ach u O Dieses Rheingau        he exclaimed in a letter to Ancillon in I8I5 at the age of twenty and the next sentence stating that the weather was divine and that the church bells were ringing is followed by twentyeight exclamation points Haake seems to think that Ancillon was at fault in not correcting earlier this ecstatic lack of selfcontrol but it is doubtful whether it would have been possible to do this There is a curious family resemblancesliglht but unmistakablebetween the hysterical outbursts of this medieval romantic Hohenzollern and the exKaisers private notes as recently published by Kautsky Most interesting to the general student of German history is the authors account of the way in which Ancillon opposed the adoption of constitutional government in Prussia Under the inspiration of the War of Liberation and of Hardenberg Frederick William III had signed on May 22 I8I5 a project for a Prussian parliament and constitu tion But Ancillon persuaded him to keep it locked up in his desk for some weeks After Waterloo Ancillon again secured the postponement of the execution of the project then its displacement by the Staatsrat of I8I7 and finally its abortion by a definite return to the old system of medieval estates SIDNEY B FAY360 Reviezws of Books Memoirs of the Empress Eugenie By Comte Fleury In two vol umes New York and London D Appleton and Company i920 pp 473 56T 750 The life of the Empress Eugenie afforded a rare opportunity for memoirs For the entire period of the Second Empire she played an important part No spectator had a better place from which to see and hear the play Then after the curtain fell there came to her a long period for deep and quiet reflection Her complex and elusive personality supplied an additional element of interest and signifi cance All who are interested in history may well rejoice that the memoirs which were to be expected have appeared so soon after the death of the empress With these as with all memoirs historians will first ask when and by whom they were written The books themselves give no direct state ment as to the date of writing But the internal evidence shows almost conclusively that the memoirs were completed except possibly for unim portant details about ten years ago The titlepages announce that the memoirs are by Comte Fleury There is however a report in circula tion that the empress dictated the memoirs to him The internal evi dence in my judgment indicates very clearly that in the main the empress was the real author1 The two volumes are of quite different character In the first the empress and her personal interests especially the prince imperial and the court life occupy a large place Her whole career is covered but there are only a few pages upon her youth and upon her later life in England after the fall of the Empire The second volume consists of fifteen chapters each dealing with some important feature of the history of the Second Empire mainly with its foreign affairs Nine of the fifteen chapters are devoted to the FrancoPrussian War Probably the first volume will interest the greater number of readers but historians will value the memoirs more for the second In both volumes but especially the second the recollection of the empress is supplemented by numerous contemporaneous documents many of them hitherto unpublished Among these are a good many re ports of conversations and memoranda by Napoleon III The remainder come from members of the imperial court especially from General Fleury It is unfortunate that for many of these documents exact in formation as to time of writing and authorship is lacking The memoirs contain no surprises There is nothing in them that will compel any very considerable rewriting of the history of the Second Empire They are interesting and clever Bonapartist propaganda plead ing for a more lenient judgment upon the Second Empire than has hitherto prevailed Almost everything in the life of France which went well is ascribed to the wisdom and benevolence of Napoleon III The 1 An article by the reviewer in the New York Evening Post Literary Review Oct 30 1920 p 14 gives the argument as to date of writing and authorshipMinor Notices 36I evils which his regime brought upon the country are by implication at least attributed chiefly to the malevolent opposition of his opponents in France Probably the most distinctive feature of the memoirs is the portrait they draw of the empress It is I think much too favorable inaccurate because incomplete But it is done with sincerity modesty and good taste It is a revelation of tlle empress as she would like to be seen FRAN K MALOY ANDERSON International Labor Legislation By Iwao Frederick Ayusawa PhD Columbia University Studies in History Economics and Public Law vol XCI no 2 New York Longmans 1920 pp 258 200 Mr Ayusawa describes his essay as a study of the history and progress of treaties conventions and congresses which have resulted in labor legis lation of international validity Twothirds of the report is given to a description of the attempts to secure such legislation from the early nine teenth century through the Great War The account begins with Robert Owens address before members of the Holy Alliance in i8i8 in which he contended that  the prime task of the governments of Europe was the international fixation of the legal limits of normal industrial condi tions  The development is traced through the rise of the international socialist organizations the Internationales the formation of inter national tradeunions the various treaties and agreements which Euro pean governments have entered into and the several nonofficial organ izations which have worked to secure these agreements the most im portant of which has been the International Association for Labor Legislation The sources from which the account is drawn are scat tered and the assembled material will be useful to the student in the field of labor even though he may be puzzled by several indefinite refer ences such as that to an international labor conference first men tioned on page 33 and by some errors possibly typographical as in the case of the year i8oo on page 30 The remainder of the report is devoted mainly to the first Labor Conferenice under the League of Nations held in Washington in the autumn of i919 to which were appointed members from different coun tries as provided for in the Treaty of Peace and which the author him self attended He describes its organization the adoption of the con ventions on the eighthouir day unemployment the employment of women and children and the recommendations on unhealthy processes which are to become the basis of legislation in different countries The ac count is given with a vividness which shows the writer to have been an interested observer particularly with regard to the provisions which were so significant for Japan Unfortunately the story stops short of the congress in Genoa and the activities of the International Labor Office AIkY HEWES362 Reviews of Books Literature in a Changing Age By Ashley H Thorndike Professor of English in Columbia University New York Macmillan Company I920 PP 3I8 300 The Changing Age is the Victorian era and the purpose of the book is to set forth the changes wrought in the content and manner of Victorian literature by the political economic religious and other developments of the period The points of contact between the life and the literature are the more numerous and varied because the authors conception of literature is broad not to say loose including much that is confessedly ephemeral and of small artistic value such as newspapers and magazines although he lays chief emphasis upon writing that  moves our imagination and sympathy  Introductory chapters discuss the permanent and the changing in literature and the literary inheritance from the generation of Wordsworth Byron and Keats which formed a point of departure for Victorian literature The Reading Public is the title of a chapter on changes in the numbers and taste of readers during the course of the century with special insist ence on the  Gargantuan appetite  of the modern public Carlyle as a powerful and pioneer figure is then considered at some length in rela tion to his environment much being made of his shift of interest from the mystical romanticism of Sartor Resartus to the economic and poli tical ills diagnosed in Past and Present and later works Subsequent chapters deal with the reflection in poetry novels and essays of the labor agitation the growth in England of the ideas of democracy and empire the transformation of theology under the influence of science the feminist movement and the effect of science invention and ma chinery upon modern life The last two chapters Beauty and Art and the Future affirm that Victorian conceptions of beauty widened to em brace a greater variety of subjects literature thereby becoming a more comprehensive and valuable transcript of the age and prophesy that this widening process will continue One always takes up with respect a work by Professor Thorndike but this book is below his reputation It is solid and sensible and pre sents truly the main facts about the period and its literature But the ground covered is so wide that little not already known to the student of history or of literature can be told within the small compass of the volume and the book lacks the unity lucidity and brilliancy which could alone make memorable so brief a treatment of so large and complex a subject WALTER C BRONSON Direct and Indirect Costs of the Great World War By Ernest L Bogart Professor of Economics University of Illinois Washington Carnegie Endowment for International Peace I9I9 PP vi 330 IOO Behind Professor Bogarts ambitious attempt to estimate and summarize the total cost of the war lies a mass of laboriously collected material presented in so usable a form that many a harassed student of the finanMinor Notices 363 cial policies of nations will turn to it gratefully The major part of the volume is concerned with the direct outlays of the belligerent countries Great Britain and her dominions the principal allied and associated powers and Germany and her allies are considered in turn In each case the authors procedure is to note important changes in the currency and to follow with numerical and descriptive statements of expenditures loans and taxation during the successive years of the war The in direct costs of the war which include casualties the death toll in civilian life property losses and the loss in production are treated briefly In the conclusion the costs of the war are combined and the final figure set at 337946I79657 As an analysis of the financial history of each of the great countries during the war period Professor Bogarts contribution is not only im portant but unique In the case of the larger countries the information is authentic and the gaps are few The brief sections are in effect sig nificant outlines of histories which are as yet largely unwritten But for Rumania Greece and Serbia the direct costs are almost whollv estimated and for thirteen other entente allies a blanket estimate of 500000000 in direct outlays is given The attempt to estimate the indirect costs of the war is correctlv described in the authors foreword as  attended with a considerable amount of conjecture and    to be regarded merely as the best guess which is possible at the present time  The loss of human life is now to a considerable extent a matter of record but the capitalized value of that life is a matter in which one mans guess is as good as anothers and possibly as good as the French actuarys estimates used by the author The figures for property losses on land and by sea are almost equally elusive The cost of war relief and the outlays of neutrals can perhaps be approximated Insuperable difficulties lie in the way of calculating the loss of production but the figure is placed at 45ooooooooothe largest single item in the list of indirect costs which total I5i612 542560 It is an axiom of statistical method that a numerical total is no more accurate than its weakest member In view of the estimate of 45 ooooooooo for loss in production the grand total of 337946179657 as the price which the world has paid for the war loses much of its mean ing It is not as an accurate summary of the costs of the war but as an outline of the financial history of the great powers that the book will prove permanently useful

aggression ch V A brief conclusion and three appendixes dealing more specifically with the atrocities complete the work The book proper repeats what is now a wellknown story The appendixes especially the account of the tragedy at Aerschot contribute testimony which cannot be ignored The work is very clear in style and remarkably restrained in tone The author who is well known not only for his numerous and re markable contributions in the field of early European history but also for his great work as a teacher of scientific method in history seems to have been rather unjustly regarded as proGerman in his intellectual sympathies He had frankly admired German historical scholarship and had sought to establish the history seminar in Belgium On the other hand he had equally admired the lucidity of French exposition and fully succeeded in making it his own The possibility of appropriating the excellent qualities of both without incurring intellectual vassallage to either would probably be admitted without argument by dispassionate students Certainly the present work reveals the author as a true patriot without prejudice to his reputation as a critical scholar Perhaps this is the chief motive of his literary executors in presenting this work to the world so late A C K The Russian Peasant and the Revolution By Maurice G Hindus New York Henry Holt and Company I920 pp xii 327 200 The problem of the Russian peasant is one of the most important and most trying problems of the Russian past and present It is sufficient to state that the peasants form 85 per cent of the Russian population and are steadily increasing much more than the citypopulation The problem presents itself broadly speaking as follows What is the Russian peasant and what is the part he will play in Russia in the future The book of Hindus tries to solve this problem Hindus seems to be personally acquainted with the life of the Russian peasant and has completed his personal impressions through wide reading of different Russian books The result of both is a book written with good knowledge of the subject with great sympathy for the Russian peasant and in a good style The best chapters are the first eight which depict the economic and the social life of the peasants My only objections to this vivid picture are i the author treats Russia as a whole for him the Russian peasant and the conditions of his life are the same everywhere this is mislead ing one type of the Russian peasant and one type of his economic lifeMinor Notices 365 do not exist they are utterly different in different parts of Russia 2 the author describes almost exclusively the economic life of the peasants I expected to find a larger amount of information on the re ligious habits and on the morals of the peasant 3 he gives a very rosy idealized picture of the character of the Russian peasant a picture usually given by the socalled Russian popularists narodniki 1 In dealing with the political side of the problem chs IXXVII Hindus is very keen in criticizing the different solutions of the agrarian problem proposed by the different political parties in Russia both liberal and socialistic He seems to advocate the thesis that the peasants were right in using the regime of the Bolsheviki for taking the land from the landowners without waiting for a general and fair solution of the agrarian problem by the Constituent Assembly I completely disagree with Hindus in this respect The tumultuous way of seizing the land and the elementary way of dividing it among the neighbors of the seized estates are unfair and seem to me a great regression both from the point of view of morals and of economics They bring Russia back to the conditions of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and their eco nomic results would make her an easy prey for her more advanced neighbors I am convinced that the solution of the agrarian problem in Russia is not yet found and that every new government of Russia even a peasants government will be obliged to start afresh with this tremen dous problem and to find a fair and just way of its solution M ROSTOVTSEV Handbooks prepared under the Direction of

Jainuarv I759May I766 Collections of the Connecticut Historical Societvy vol XVIII Hartford the Society I920 pp xxiii 457 300 With the issue of the second volume of the Fitch Papers the editor Mr Bates emerges from the confines of strictly Connecticut history and enters the broader field of imperial relations Some of the problems of the previous volume concerned it is true other colonies than Connecti ctut and brought us at times into touch with Great Britain but none of them rose to the dignity of major issues in the same sense as do those here presented connected as the latter are with the closing years ofMinor Notices 367 the Seven Years War the peace of Paris the renewal of the Molasses Act and the passing of the Stamp Act Even the Susquehannah ques tion which in its later phases as here depicted becomes AngloAmerican in importance was at first but a comparatively small matter and the Mohegan question though carried eventually up to the King in Council never became of more than local interest But from 1759 to I766 Con necticut steps out into the limelight and her leading problems are to an extent greater than ever before those of all the colonies Anyone deal ing with this period must reckon with the documents here printed for they throw light often in unexpected places From them we not only learn much about Connecticuts contribution to the war and her rela tions with General Amherst but obtain also such interesting incidental facts as that Connecticut men served with the British regulars and in the regiments of other colonies we acquire important information re garding the colonial agencies in London of Jackson Ingersoll Johnson and Life we understand better than before Connecticuts financial deal ings with England and her manner of handling the money received from Parliament we find here the text of the lost State of the Trade drawn up by the Boston merchants in I763 and in close connection with it Connecticuts own protest against the renewal of the Molasses Act and above all else we get valuable additions to our knowledge of the conferences and debates preceding the passage of the Stamp Act Some of this material has been printed before and some of it has been used by Professor Gipson in his account of Jared Ingersoll and by Miss Bailey in her paper on the Susquehannah controversy but it can all be used again with profit Mr Bates does not often nod but we cannot understand why he should twice refer to the  State Paper Office  as if it were a place where documents can still be found and we wonder a little that he should have passed by Samuel Marten to whom In gersoll wrote a long letter in I76I pp I31I34 as if he were a person easy to identify We are glad to be able to state that another volume of the series containing the papers and correspondence of Governor Pitkin is already in preparation and will probably be issued in the spring The Pitkin volume will be the last of a remarkably useful publication of which the Connecticut Historical Society may well be proud C M A Maine in the Northeastern Boutndary Controversy By Henry S Burrage State Historian State Librarian I919 pp xiv 398 350 This work is of the  local history  type relating with extreme particu larity and in great detail itncidents of interest primarily only to residents of the district or cummunity where the incidents occurred Nevertheless the Maine boundary question was and is of great importance in Ameri can diplomatic history and the author has made some contributions of fact and some corrections of error in his extremely painstaking though rather dreary presentation He gives excellent summaries of the argu AM HIST REV vOL XXVI24368 Reviews of Books ments advanced by Maine New Brunswick the United States and Great Britain all through the controversy of which Webster said the argu ments were as difficult to follow as the boundary itself An interesting fact stated by Mr Burrage is that whatever the truth of the accusation that Preble the American minister to the Netherlands sent advance in formation of the Netherlands award to Maine a month before he sent it to Washington there is at least no proof of this to be found in the Maine archives The author comments on a previous local history on the boundary controversy written by the Hon Israel Washburn that it is in error in naming two British and one American as members of the St Croix Commission of 1796 and then attacking the decision of the Commission as necessarily  British  Mr Burrage says that in fact there were two Americans and one British commissioner and defends the decision of the commission The archives of Maine evi dently have been very thoroughly studied by the author but he gives little evidence of acquaintance with the many monographs both British and American that have been written on various aspects of the Maine boundary controversy The work is better organized in the earlier than in the later chapters As a whole it constitutes an addition to knowledge which must be used by the general historian of the controversy E D A Auatobiography of Anizdrew Carntegie Boston and New York Houghton Mifflin Company I920 pp xii 385 500 The group of admirable biographies of the captains of industry which already in cludes important works on Jay Cooke Henry Villard James J Hill and Lord Strathcona is noticeably enlarged by this selfdrawn portrait of the steelmaster Although the book has been touched up here and there by the friendly pen of Professor John C Van Dyke it is essentially and convincingly the work of Carnegie himself The historian will regret that it confines itself more to portraiture than to documentation that it throws little new light upon partly known facts and that it has none of the elaborate accuracy likely to be found in the biography of a man who seeks to justify himself Andrew Carnegie was satisfied with himself and the rest of the Scotsmen f rom his earliest years With the simplicity of the great prestidigitator he transforms the humble errand boy into the associate of emperors and the benefactor of society He conceals the steps by which he rose if indeed he ever knew them The searcher for the principles upon which success is founded will find here little to illustrate any rule He will find maxims enough for Carnegie was only less fertile than Poor Richard in wise apothegms but he may end by wish ing for fewer maxims and more abundant proof It is highly improbable that Carnegie became leader in the developMinor Notices 369 ment of the use of steel by following his own motto never to go

Railroad he was giving an evidence of cool willingness to take risks He knew as well how to advertise His practice as a messenger boy in Pittsburgh to learn the faces of his customers and flatter them by de livering messages to them on the street is worthy of Franklin His advice to the officeboy to do something outside the line of duty in order to catch the attention of the boss comes close to

genuine devotion to the task of spread ing these values among his fellows The amiable delight that he re ceived from academic robes and festive orations was a slight price to pay for the facilities of education that he spread throughout the world He patronized the Kaiser as unconsciously as he did the humblest laborer in his mills Btit he could stir up movements that show him as a keen weigher of

Economics in DePauw University New York D Appleton and Company I920 PP 3I3 As its title implies Professor Carltons book is not a history of labor but of labors influence on American social and political development There is it is true a chapter of about thirty pages on the rise and growth of the labor movement but that is only by way of introduction It is followed by chapters on labors relation to the adoption of the Constitution to the public school system land reform labor legislation minor reform movements and political action The volume is therefore unique in that it attempts to bring eco nomic social and political history together and for that reason should be welcomed by both economists and historians It might very well supplement a textbook in either political or economic history The authors purpose however is not coldly scientific He shows a lively sympathy for the humane aspects of the labor movement Writing when370 Reviews of Books the zeal for reconstruction was abroad in the land he hoped for a new age of services cooperation and mutual aid to take the place of the old epoch of strife profits and international rivalry Indeed some passages were evidently written while the American utopia seemed within his grasp Still with a scholars caution he warns us that the vision may fade nay is now fading and that industrial chaos lies just ahead Leav ing advocacy and prophecy aside we may say that the author has ac complished his modest purpose of helping to bring American history into a truer perspective by showing the influence of the wageearner on the course of events As he remarks a great deal has been written on the influence of the frontiera thinig of the pastand the time has come to emplhasize a power that has been and is increasing Surely no one can quarrel with that MARY BEARD The New Frontier a Study of the American Liberal Spirit its Fronttier Origin and its Application to Modern Problems By Guy Emerson New York Henry Holt and Company I920 PP xii 314 200 If the prospective reader picks up this book with the expecta tion of finding a discussion of the frontier in its later manifestations he is doomed to disappointment for as the secondary title indicates it is a spiritual and not a physical frontier which Mr Emerson discusses As he states it  the main purpose of this book is to point out how this great heritage the spirit of the frontiersman may invigorate our work and keep fresh our inherent idealism  After a preface by Professor Hazen and a brief introduction the author attempts in a chapter on the Frontier of American Character to state the significance of the constantly advancing line of civilization in this he testifies to the influ ence of the works of Professor Lurner to whose writings he owes in large part his inspiration to put pen to paper The frontier he main tains is still with us but  it is a frontier industrial financial com mercial political social educational artistic diplomatic religious  The remaining chapters have indeed a slight thread in occasional refer ence to this frontier spirit which may be said to tie them into some sort of a unified whole but all might well have been printed separately as essays on such topics as the Leadership that made America What is a Liberal Human Resources or the American Spirit in World Affairs The last chapter entitled the New Frontier is an attempt to synthesize Americas problems and to state the attitude in which they should be faced Mr Emerson belongs to that somewhat neglected though numerous group of liberals as distinguished from radicals on the one hand and reactionaries on the other And it is to this inchoate and as yet largely inarticulate body that this country has to look for guidance if the tasks of the present are met as the pioneer faced the unsubdued wildernessMinior Notices 37 I with an Americanism which  is a basic love of the square deal of fair play    a love sometimes submerged in the show and bustle of twen tiethcentury achievement of rugged simplicity both of living and character  Written by a layman for laymen with a limited and somewhat un even bibliography appended for the use of readers not especially familiar with the development of the United States the book is interesting and valuable as an illustration of one type of thought which has to be taken into consideration by the student of forces making American history today L B SHIPPEE The  Corsair  is the War Zonze By Ralph D Paine Boston and New York Houghton Miffin Company I920 PP xiii 303 400 This wellwritten and attractively got up volume though primarily a more or less personal record of an armed yacht and her ships company nevertheless possesses undoubted historical value as the chronicle of a typical vessel of her class the mission of which was to make good the serious lack of destroyers and scouting craft in our navy in 19I7 The name Corsair has long held an honorable place in our naval annals for its former bearer rechristened the Gloucester made a dashing name for herself off Santiago in I898 under the heroic Wainwright It is unfortunate that the United States has never followed the example of Great Britain and enrolled in her naval reserve the best of her merchant steamers and it is therefore the more to the credit of American owners that they immediately placed their vessels at Uncle Sams disposition for a nominal rental The strenuous and varied career of the Corsair under Commander Kittinger and afterwards under Lieut Commander Porter her original yachting skipper is replete with in terest and is told by Mr Paine with simplicity and spirit It is well to have so detailed a record and so typical a one of the astonishing manner in which a lot of landsmen most of them innocent of salt water were turned in a marvellously short time into accomplished seamen and naval mechanics The book is a welcome and valuable minor contribution to the history of the World War The numerous and excellent illustrations greatly add to its attractiveness EDWARD BRECIC RussianAnmerican Relations AIarch i9i7March I920 Documents and Papers Compiled and edited by C K Cumming and Walter W Pettit New York Harcourt Brace and Howe 1920 pp xxviii 375 350 The executive committee of the League of Free Nations As sociation having resolved to undertake an inquiry into the relations between the United States and Russia since the revolution of March372 Reviews of Books I9I7 entrusted the inquiry to a committee of three Dr John A Ryan Mr J Henry Scattergood and Mr William Allen White who caused this volume to be prepared by Mr C K Cumming and by Captain Walter W Pettit who as a member of the Military Intelligence Division of the United States Army had accompanied Mr William C Bullitt in his brief mission to Petrograd in March I9I9 The result is the present collection of documents and papers some 270 in number dated from March i6 I9I7 to February 24 I920 and furnishing an extraordinary and welcome affluence of material illustrating the diplomatic and quasi diplomatic relations maintained by our government with that of Russia It is much to be wished that we might have many more of such books illustrative of our foreign relations especially in view of the sparing manner in which on the whole our Department of State gives forth documentary evidence respecting those relations Gratitude for the publication however should not impose silence as to its faults which are of such a character as to impair greatly its usefulness First of all the selection of documents besides being very slight for the period of the provisional and Kerensky governments has also somewhat of an ex parte character Out of 270 documents I37 have apparently been con tributed by Mr Raymond Robins whose attitude toward the administra tion is sufficiently well known a third of the rest are from the Izvestia the official organ of the Soviet government while other Russian authori ties have almost no representation most of the rest are from the New York Times and its Current History The reader will not fail to be struck with the entire absence of papers derived directly from the State Department except for five that are taken from one of its publications A more serious effort should surely have been made to procure authori tative material from that source and to the reviewers knowledge would not have been unsuccessful Such a recourse would have given greater completeness and fairness to the books exhibit We should like besides knowing what Colonel Robins and others cabled to Washington to know more of what was cabled in reply Such a recourse might also have improved the texts in some cases e g one of the most important docu ments is known to have had an important additional paragraph of which no trace is here given On the paper jacket of the book the publishers assert that all the available documents and papers which seemed im portant have been included but the editorial committee do not claim so much If however this partial publication shall cause the State De partment to print more frankly it will have done additional good Publications of the American Jewish Historical Society No 27 The Lyons Collection vol II The Society I920 pp xx 6i8 This second volume of the Lyons collection contains a great mass of notes on American Jewish history which the Rev J J Lyons with indefatigable industry collected during a long period of labor in that field Many ofMinor Notices 373 his data have been discovered independently by other workers in the same field and published during the long period between the time of his death and the date when by the generous gift of his children this volume has been placed within the reach of scholars His references and notes as to material already thus published are here calendared The rest of the book is a rich mine of material but consisting so largely of items as rather to defy reviewing Many of these items from manuscripts and from books of local history are of great interest and the sum total of what they contribute to American Hebrew history is extraordinary The items are systematically arranged and admirably indexed Stevensons Germany the Case Against Germiany in the Pacific By C Brunsdon Fletcher New York Charles Scribners Sons I920 pp xv 230 350 The purpose of this book is to show why the former German cdlonies in the Pacific should never be returned to her Robert Louis Stevenson is cited as the strongest witness against the late empire and his A Footnote to History is accepted as a strong and accurate in dictment But beyond the repetition of charges the volume contains very little of a positive nature This is naively explained by the oft repeated statement that there was almost a conspiracy of silence to with hold the facts concerning the treatment of the natives in the German possessions  No one cared to speak or to write against Germany and we are forced to argue from suggestion instead of being able to recite the facts of the case It would be easy  we are told for Germany to draw a terrible indictment against Great Britain and her Colonies in the Pacific from the attacks of English writers and publicists and it would be difficult for critics of Germany to retaliate on similar grounds if voluminous documents were essential However the author is con vinced that first in Samoa and then right through the ocean German ways with the natives have been full of treachery deceit and devilish ness  and the feeling throughout Australasia is that Germany can never be trusted again  Mr Fletcher is an Australian journalist who has already given us two books on the Pacific The present volume has little to commend it The organization is very faulty the materials used are slight and even they have not been presented as well as they deserved and there are certain obvious errors such as the reference to eight hundred millions of Chinese It would not be difficult for a more careful investigator to write a more useful study of the career of Germany in the Pacific P J T

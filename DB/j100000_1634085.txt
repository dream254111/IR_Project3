MERIT MANY of the problems that the writer had in view in the present research might be solved by the study of any group of a thou sand American men of science so long as they had been objectively selected The ob jective selection of a group sufficiently large for statistical treatment is however essential As cases can be quoted to illustrate the cure of nearly every disease by almost any medi cine so examples can be given in support of any psychological or sociological theory The method of anecdote as used by Lombroso may be readable literature but it is not sci ence A thousand names might have been selected by lot from all the scientific men of the country assuming a list to have been available but a group of the thousand leading men of science arranged in the order of merit has certain advantages Information in re gard to them can be better obtained than in the case of those who are more obscure Cor relations can be determined between degrees of scientific merit and various conditions The comparison with a similar group selected ten or twenty years hence or with a similar group of British French or German men of science would give interesting results The list itself if printed after an interval of twenty years would be a historical document of value Lastly the data can be so used as to carry quantitative methods a little way into a region that has hitherto been outside the range of exact science It is the last problem that I wish to take up in this paper It will be remembered that we have in each science the workers in that science arranged in the supposed order of merit by ten com petent judges who made their arrangements independently If the ten arrangements agreed exactly we should have complete con fidence in the result except in so far as it was affected by systematic or constant errors If there were no agreement at all the futility of any attempt to estimate scientific merit would be made clear The conditions are naturally intermediate There is a certain amount of agreement and a certain amount of difference of opinion Thus taking for example the ten astronomersI II III etcwhose average positions were the highest the order given to them by each of the ten observers A B C etc is as shown in the table TABLE I THE ORDER ASSIGNED TO TEN ASTRONOMERS BY TEN OBSERVERS I II III IV V VI VII VI IX X A 1 2 4 3 10 6 9 5 11 8 B 1 4 2 5 6  9 3 8 7

complete agreement that I is our leading astronomer He has been se lected as such by nine competent judges from the 160 astronomers of the country The probability that this is due to chance is en tirely negligible II stands next in scientific merit He is placed second by four of the observers third by two fourth by three and ninth by one The conditions are similar to observations in the exact sciences The av erage position or grade is 35 and the prob able error of this position is 045 i e the chances are even that this grade is correct within one half of a unit The grade of the astronomer who stands third is 48 and that of the astronomer who stands fourth is 55 There is consequently one chance in about fifty that IL deserves a grade as low as that of III and one in about one thousand that he deserves a grade as low as that of IV The order thus has a high degree of validity and this has itself been measured As we go further down the list the probable errors tend to increase the order is less certain and the difference in merit between a man and his neighbor on the list is less The variations in the sizes of the probable errors are as a rule significant When the error is small the work of the man is such that it can be judged with accuracy when it is larger it is because the work is more difficult to estimate The probable errors depend on the assump tion that the individual deviations follow the exponential law and they do so in sufficient measure for the purposes in view For those near the top of the list the distribution of errors is skewed in the negative direction that is there are relatively more large nega tive than positive errors Thus in the table there are four judgments marked with a star the deviation of each of which is more than three times the average deviation and these observations would be omitted by an ap proximate application of Chauvenets cri terion If these four observations are omit ted the grades of the ten astronomers are those given in the second line of averages The omitted judgments are not extremely di vergent barely exceeding the limits set by Chauvenets criterion and I do not regard them as invalid Indeed I believe that in view of the presence of systematic errors in these estimates the chance that they represent correct values is greater than that assigned by a strict application of the theory of proba bilities But the incidence of an extreme judgment might in special cases do injustice to an individual and in the order used Chau venets criterion has been applied2 This means that a compromise has been adopted between the median and the average judg ment but the departure from the average judgment is small affecting less than one fifth of the individuals and only to a slight degree The average deviations and probable errors used are those found when all the judgments are included Two probable errors are given in the table the first obtained through the error of mean square the second by taking it as directly proportional to the average devia tion The differences are not significant and for work of this character I regard it as use less to calculate the probable errors by the ordinary formula I have published else where3 a more technical discussion of the treatment of errors or deviations of this char acter and may return to the subject at some subsequent time The theory of errors com monly applied in the exact sciences is too crude for psychology and probably for the 1 In three cases where a question mark appears the astronomer did not give a position to himself In one case the name was not included among the slips 2 Among the some 15000 observations under consideration several variations might be expected to occur in a normal distribution as much as six times as large as the probable error and among the 1500 or more individuals several might be expected to deserve positions departing consider ably from those assigned But assuming that we have normal errors to deal with there is no reason why the particular individuals on whom the divergent errors fall should receive them rather than any other individuals Such errors should apparently be distributed among all the individuals Similar conditions must occur in the case of errors of observation in the exact sciences but so far as I am aware their signifi cance has not been considered Am Journ of Psychol 14 312328 1903NOVEMBER 30 1906 SCIENCE 701 sciences in which it is used Progress here will be blocked until there are psychologists who are mathematicians or mathematicians who are psychologists In order to illustrate further the serial dis tribution and the probable errors I have made a diagram for the fifty psychologists The grade of each no judgments being omit ted is shown by the vertical mark and the length of the line indicates the probable error or range within which the chances are even that the true position falls Thus the psy chologist who stands first on the list was like the astronomer given this position by the in dependent judgment of all The psychologist who stands second has as shown on the dia gram a position of 37 and a probable error of 05 i e the position 37 is the most prob able but the true position is equally likely to be within the short horizontal line between 32 and 42 or outside it It must however be remembered that the chances of the true position being far outside the range of this line decrease very rapidly Over it is roughly drawn the bellshaped curve of the normal probability integral The true position is along the base line covered by this curve and the chances of its being at any given point are proportional to the ordinate or height of the curve above the base line There is only one chance in about six that the true grade is above 27 or below 47 and only one chance in about 150 that the true grade is above 17 or below 57 It will be seen from the dia gram that while the positions of the psycholo gists II III and IV are the most probable the relative order is not determined with cer tainty On the other hand the chances are some 10000 to one that each of these psy chologists stands below I and above V It is evident that the probable errors in crease in size as we go down the list The curve of distribution drawn over No XL in dicates that the chances are even that the true FIG 1 The positions and probable errors of the fifty psychologists702 SCIENCE N S VOL XXIV No 622 position falls between the grades of XXXIV and L and that there is one chance in four that he does not belong among our fifty lead ing psychologists The increase in the size of the probable errors is irregular it being more difficult to assign a position to some men than to others It will be noted that the psychologists fall into groups the first twenty being set off from the next group though the two groups are bridged over by three cases At this point also the probable errors become almost sud denly about three times as large There are altogether about 200 psychologists in the country and it looks as if the first tenth forms a separate group of leaders There is a similar though less marked group of the first twenty astronomers but these groups seem to be partly accidental There is how ever as shown below an inflection point in the curve of distribution after about the first tenth of our scientific men The first twenty psychologists fall into four distinct groups and there are groupings in the other sciences They do not however appear to be sufficiently marked to lead us to distinguish species such as men of genius and men of talent It is however possible that the complicated condi tions may ultimately be analyzed so as to give such groups The probable errors not only tell the accu racy with which the psychologists can be ar ranged in the order of merit but they also measure the differences between them This indeed I regard as the most important result of this paper as science is advanced chiefly by the extension of quantitative methods and it might not have been foreseen that it would be possible to measure degrees of scientific merit Our data are concerned with the recog nition of scientific performance not with ab stract ability if such a thing is conceivable Merit is in performance not in nonperform ance and expert judgment is the best and in the last resort the only criterion of perform ance The difference in scientific merit between any two of the psychologists whose positions and probable errors are shown in the chart is directly as the distance between them and inversely as their probable errors If two of them are close together on the scale and if the probable errors are large the difference between them is small and conversely If the psychologists II and III were sepa rated by 05 and their probable errors were 05 as is approximately the case then the difference between them is so small that there is one chance in four that the position of III is above the grade of II If again the psy chologists XL and XLIX were separated by 6 and their probable errors were 6 as is ap proximately the case then there is again one chance in four that the true position of XLIX is above the grade of XL The dif ference between IL and III is thus about the same as that between XL and XLIX If we take the fifty psychologists in groups of 10 and thus partly eliminate the chance variations the average probable errors of the five groups are 07 18 42 58 62 These probable errors are subject to a correction for the range covered by the grades Thus the first ten cover a range of about eleven points and the last ten a range of about six points and the differences between the psychologists at the top of the list would be nearly twice as great as between those at the bottom of the list if the probable errors were the same When we take account of both factors the probable errors in the five groups are 06 19 18 64 and 107 While the probable errors are determined with a considerable degree of exactness which is itself measured the ranges covered by the grades seem to depend on the special conditions in the science they are not the same in the different sciences and their validity can not be determined with any exactness Subject however to a consider able probable error the range of merit covered by the fifty psychologists is inversely as the figures given and reduced to a scale of 100 would be 556 175 185 52 and 32 Thus we can say that the psychologists at the top of the list are likely to differ from each other about 18 times as much as the psychologists at the bottom of the list We have no zero point from which we can meas ure psychological merit Mlen who are 6 ft 2 in tall are likely to differ from each otherNOVEMBER 30 1906 SCIENCE 703 about ten times as much as men who are about 5 ft 8 in tall though the difference in their height is only as 6874 Even though we assumed the zero point to be where psy chological performance begins or at the sur vival minimum of human ability we should only obtain relative differences  The astronomers and the psychologists have been used as illustrations The number of students of astronomy and of psychology in the country does not differ greatly and it is assumed that they represent an equal range of scientific merit It is possible that it requires more ability to be an astronomer than to be a psychologist and it is equally possible that in view of the larger endowments longer his tory and more conventional problems less ability will suffice for the astronomer The curves of distribution might also vary for example it might be relatively easier to be an astronomer of moderate performance but more difficult to be a great astronomer There are indications of such differences but the data at hand do not disclose them with any degree of certainty There are 100 geologists and 100 botanists on the list who are about one fourth of all the geologists and botanists of the country These are assumed to cover about the same range of scientific merit as the astronomers or the psychologists The average difference between the geologists would consequently be about half that between the astronomers and the probable errors of position should theoret ically be about twice as large The anthro pologists are the smallest class of scientific men numbering in all about ninety of whom 20 are included in the thousand under con sideration They are again assumed to cover a range of performance equal to that of the astronomers or geologists the average differ ence between them being two and a half times as great as between the astronomers or five times as great as between the geologists The chemists are the most numerous class of scien tific men 175 being included in the thousand There are 150 physicists 150 zoologists 80 mathematicians 60 pathologists 40 physiolo gists and 25 anatomists In the accompanying table are given the TABLE II GRADES AND

science who were assigned positions at the head of each of the twelve sciences All the anthropologists are thus included in the table but only two fifths of the astronomers one fifth of the geologists etc In cases in which an individual stands relatively higher in an other science a star is attached It will be observed that the grades are as a rule lower than the positions As has been stated the distribution of the judgments or errors in the upper part of the list is skewed in a negative direction so that the average judgment is lower than the median judgment Further down the list this tendency disap pears and towards the bottom not given in the table except for the anatomists and an thropologists the skew is in the opposite direction Chauvenets criterion has been ap plied it causes but an insignificant difference in the order and for statistical purposes the extra calculations involved were superfluous As has been explained however the incidence of a divergent judgment which might be due to ignorance or prejudice might be unjust to an individual The probable errors have been obtained by taking them directly proportional to the average deviation and assuming that there were always ten judgments In the comparatively few cases where there were less than ten judgments the probable errors of the average are too small but the differences are not significant In the measurement of sci entific merit we are concerned not with the probable error of the average but with the average probable error which does not depend on the number of cases Figures for both might be given but they are so nearly alike and so lacking in significance that it is not worth while As the table shows there are in astronomy pathology and psychology men who are placed distinctly at the head In the other sciences those who stand first have grades varying from 16 to 36 In most cases the differences in grade are less than the probable errors or not much larger and the position is not deter mined to a single place though it is deter mined with a theoretically high degree of validity within a very few places Various groupings occur which seem to represent the existing conditions of the sciences Thus there are breaks of two or more units after chemists 4 and 8 physicist 2 zoologists 4 and 6 geologists 2 5 and 7 botanist 8 mathe maticians 3 6 and 8 pathologists 1 4 5 and 9 psychologist 1 physiologists 7 and 9 anat omists 2 and 9 and anthropologist 5 On the other hand there are cases in which consecu tive numbers are bracketed or practically bracketed Thus mathematicians 4 5 and 6 have a grade of 57 These various groupings appear to be about what the probable errors would lead us to expect The probable errors tend to increase as we go down the lists but with considerable ir regularity This irregularity is in part due to normal variability where the number of observations is small and the average devia tions are relatively large but the larger de partures are usually significant it being easier to assign a position to some men of science than to others Thus for example it is not easy to compare a man who has made one or two important discoveries with a man who has accomplished a large mass of useful work The tendency of the probable errors to in crease is however significant It is easier to assign the order at the top of the list and the difficulty increases as we go downward This subjective fact is measured by the probable errors It is in part due to less knowledge of those whose work is less important I know of no way to eliminate this factor or to measure its influence But the main factor is the real differences between the men and these are assumed to be inversely as the prob able errors and directly as the differences in grade In table III are given all the probable errors averaged in six groups for each of the sciences In the first and second groups are included one tenth of those in each science and in the remaining groups one fifth That is the probable errors are divided into five equal groups but the first group is divided into two subgroups in view of the fact that the probable errors of the first tenth are dis tinctly smaller than those of the second tenthNOVEMBER 30 1906 SCIENCE 705 TABLE III PROBABLE ERRORS IN EACH OF THE SCIENCES THE MEN OF SCIENCE BEING DIVIDED INTO SIX GROUPS U Q S 3   o 0 X 3 e o 0 bD    0

group and in the lower part these figures have been reduced to a common stand ard of a thousand so that the results for the different sciences may be comparable If the range of ability is the same in each science and if the difficulty of assigning the order in each science is the same then the figures in the lower third of the table should tend to be the same in the different sciences As the averages include from 2 to 35 cases they are subject to a probable error which varies considerably Thus to take for ex ample an intermediate casethe botanists the probable errors of the six entries in the upper part of the table are 025 033 018 028 022 025 They thus seem to be de termined with considerable validity When the probable errors are adjusted for the ranges a considerable  chance variation is intro duced If the figures were broken up into groups 3f different sizes the results would be differed t The figures in the last three groups of eac of the sciences seem scarcely to be signifik tnt of real differences in the sciences though they to a certain extent measure the actuall existing conditions The figures in the table give the validity with iw Lich the positions are determined and at the lame time measure the relative differ ences I Atween the men in the several groups Thus I Le first tenth of the chemists have on the av rage their positions determined rela tively   other chemists with a probable error of two Iaces and the last fifth with a probable error  25 places In relation to the first hundre l scientific men a chemist in this grouplas his position determined on the average apart from the error due to the in terpolation with a probable error of 11 places whereas in relation to the last 200 scientific men the place is determined with a probable error of 145 places706 SCIENCE N S VOL XXIV No 622 The figures also show that the average dif ferences between the chemists who are in the first tenth are about eight times as great as between the chemists towards the middle of the list and about twelve times as great as between the chemists towards the bottom of the list As has been stated there are considerable variations in the figures for the different sci ences In general however those in the first hundred differ from each other about ten times as much as those in the last four hun dred among whom there are no constant dif ferences It is scarcely safe to draw infer ences from the variations in the different groups and in the different sciences If the probable errors in one science were consist ently higher than in another it would mean that in the former science it is more difficult to make the arrangement which might be due to greater diversity in the work to be com pared or to greater similarity in the men The greater similarity in the men would prob ably be due to there having been relatively too many men included in that science But such consistent differences do not appear Thus the psychologists have the largest prob able error in the last group but the smallest in the third group and the mathematicians have the second smallest probable error in the last group but the second largest in the first group In so far as these figures are signifi cant they might mean that our able psycholo gists are more able than our able mathemati cians whereas our lesser psychologists are less able than our lesser mathematicians It is probably true that our leading psychologists would compare more favorably with those of Germany France and Great Britain than our leading mathematicians but inferences as to the variation in the distribution of ability in the different sciences can not be made from the data at hand with any considerable degree of validity It would however be of interest to have comparable data for different nations and for different periods The workers in the twelve sciences have been combined into one series by interpola tion it being assumed that the range of ability in each science is the same The probable errors have at the same time been increased to correspond with a thousand cases as shown in table III This makes the probable errors relatively correct but does not allow for the additional chance variations caused by the interpolation The list is of considerable in terest as it enables us to compare with more or less accuracy men of science working in diverse directions The order grades and probable errors of the fifty who stand first are given to illustrate the method We can thus say that the work of a certain physicist is equal in value to the work of a certain zoologist or that a certain TABLE IV THE ORDER THE SCIENCE THE GRADE AND THE PROBABLE ERROR OF EACH OF THE FIRST FIFTY MEN OF SCIENCE ON THE LIST Order Science Grade P E Order Science Grade P E Order

pathologist a result thai would not be possible by direct compari son The various factors which limit the ex actness of the method should be kept in mind but we have at least the beginning of a method which with further effort can be made more accurate Similar methods can be applied to comparing the value of performance in fields even more diverse than the several sciences 0 20 40 60 O 100 FIG 2 Distribution of the thousand men of science In the accompanying curvewhich is based on substantially the same figures as are given in table III except that a man is given a position only in the science in which he stands the highestis shown the distribution of the thousand men of science The 1000 scientific men are divided into ten group s th range of enunence or merit covered by each hundred being proportional to the space it occupies on the axis of the abscissas and the number of each degree of ability being proportional to the ordinates The range of merit covered by each hundred becomes smaller and there are more of each degree of merit as we pass from the first to the second hundred and so on for the first five hundred after which the differences become very small The first hun dred men of science cover a range of merit about equal to that of the second and third hundreds together and this again is very nearly equal to the range covered by the re maining seven hundred The average differ ences between the men in the first hundred are about twice as great as between the men in the second and third hundreds and about seven times as great as between the men in the remaining groups Or the differences among the first hundred are almost exactly ten times as great as among the last five hundred who differ but little among themselves It would be desirable to compare this distribution with that of the normal probability integral and with the salaries paid to scientific men but the data are not as yet at hand J MAKEEN CATTELL COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY

J100688,ABSTRACTS OF THE PAPERS PRINTED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,109798,FURTHER EXPERIMENTS ON THE LIGHT OF THE CASSEGRAINIAN TELESCOPE COMPARED WITH THAT OF THE GREGORIAN ABSTRACT,I207043,493 OF PLATES REQUISITE FOR COMPLETE POLARIZATION OF THE TRANSMITTED BEANM IS 30 AND SINCE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE WHOLE OF THE LIGHT THAT IS NOT REFLECTED AT THE FIRST SURFACE IS TRANSMITTED THROUGH THE WHOLE SERIES THE AUTHOR OBSERVES THAT TRANSMISSION IS NOT IN THIS CASE A MAXIMUM AT A PERPENDICULAR INCIDENCE AND THAT THE LAW EMPLOYED BY BOUGUER FAILS BY REASON OF THESE NEWLYDISCOVERED PROPERTIES OF LIGHT OF WHICH THAT DISTINGUISHED PHILOSOPHER WAS NOT AWARE THE CELEBRATED DISCOVERY OF MALUS OF THE POLARIZATION OF LIGHT BY OBLIQUE REFLECTION AND ITS CONNEXION WITH THE PROPERTIES OF DOUBLY REFRACTING CRYSTALS IS PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT DISCOVERY THAT HAS BEEN MADE IN OPTICS SINCE THAT OF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE ACHROMATIC TELESCOPE BUT THE AUTHOR OBSERVES THAT IT DOES NOT FURNISH US WITH ANY INFORMATION OF THE MANNER IN WHICH THESE CRYSTALS EFFECT POLARI ZATION AND THAT THE PRESENT DISCOVERY OF POLARIZATION BY OBLIQUE RE FRACTION SUPPLIES THE CONNECTING LINK BETWEEN THESE TWO CLASSES OF FACTS AND HOLDS OUT A PROSPECT OF A DIRECT EXPLANATION OF THE LEADING PHENOMENA OF DOUBLE REFRACTION SHOULD THE PRESENT PAPER MEET WITH THE APPROBATION OF THE SOCIETY DR BREWSTER PROMISES A FURTHER COMMUNICATION OF EXPERIMENTS ON THE POLARIZATION OF LIGHT BY REFLECTION IN WHICH HE DESIGNS TO SHOW THAT THE LAW OBSERVED BY MALUS IS NOT GENERAL AND THAT THE PRINCIPLE HAS BEEN COMPLETELY OVERLOOKED BY HIM AS IT DEPENDS ON THE PRO PORTION WHICH THE QUANTITY OF LIGHT REFLECTED BEARS TO THAT WHICH IS TRANSMITTED WHEN INCIDENT AT THE POLARIZING ANGLE WHEN LIGHT IS INCIDENT UPON WATER AT THE POLARIZING ANGLE HE REMARKS THAT ONLY RT4A IS REFLECTED THAT EVEN FROM GLASS ONLY R IS REFLECTED  BUT WHEN REALGAR DIAMOND OR CHROMATE OF LEAD ARE EMPLOYED THEN AT THE POLARIZING ANGLE THESE BODIES REFLECT AS MUCH AS ONE HALF OF THE LIGHT AND CONSEQUENTLY HAVE NOT POWER TO POLARIZE ALL THAT THEY RE FLECT FURTHER EXPERIMENTS ON THE LIGHT OF THE CASSEGRAINIAN TELESCOPE COM PARED WITH THAT OF THE GREGORIAN BY CAPTAIN HENRY KATER BRI GADEMAJOR IN A LETTER ADDRESSED TO THE RIGHT HON SIR JOSEPH BANKS BART KB PRS READ NOVEMBER 18 1813 PHIL TRANS 1814P 231 THE EXPERIMENTS DETAILED IN THE PRESENT LETTER WERE CONDUCTED EXACTLY IN THE SAME MANNER AS THOSE DETAILED BY CAPT KATER IN HIS FORMER COMMUNICATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF COMPARING A NEW CASSE GRAINIAN TELESCOPE MADE BY MR CRICKMORE OF IPSWICH WITH THE GREGORIAN USED IN THE FORMER EXPERIMENTS THE DIAMETER OF THE LARGE SPECULUM IN THIS INSTRUMENT IS 49 INCHES BUT WAS REDUCED BY A RING OF PASTEBOARD TO 36 IN ORDER TO RENDER THE ILLUMINATION EQUAL TO THAT OF THE GREGORIAN IN WHICH THE LARGE SPECULUM MEASURED 395 INCHES THE AREAS EXPOSED TO THE LIGHT BEING ESTIMATED AT 7152 AND 10593 AND THE MAGNIFYING POWERS AT THE SAME TIME BEING 157 AND494 125 RESPECTIVELY THE ILLUMINATING POWERS OF THE TWO TELESCOPES ARE INFERRED TO BE AS 678 TO 290 THE MEAN OF THIS AND THE TWO FORMER EXPERIMENTS WITHOUT MAKIFIG ALLOWANCE FOR THE IMPERFECT POLISH OF THE CASSEGRAINIAN IN ONE OF THEM GIVES THE COMPARATIVE SUPERIORITY IN THE ILLUMINATING POWER OF THE CASSEGRAINIAN MORE THAN 2 TO 1 OR IF THE EXPERIMENT WHICH THE AU THOR CONSIDERS LESS PERFECT BE REJECTED IT WOULD APPEAR TO BE 2 TO I IN FAVOUR OF THE CASSEGRAINIAN CONSTRUCTION ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS RELATING TO THE SIDEREAL PART OF THE HEAVENS AND ITS CONNEXION WITH THE NEBULOUS PART ARRANGEDFOR THE PURPOSE OF A CRITICAL EXAMINATION BY WILLIAM HERSCHEL LLD FRS READ FEBRUARY 24 1814 PHIL TRANS 1814 P 248 IN A FORMER COMMUNICATION TO THE SOCIETY THE AUTHOR ENDEAVOURED TO SHOW THE PROBABILITY OF A PROGRESSIVE CONDENSATION OF NEBULOUS MATTER SO AS TO PUT ON ULTIMATELY THE APPEARANCE OF STARS HIS PRE SENT OBJECT IS TO SHOW BY REFERENCE TO SELECT CASES FROM MANY THOU SAND FORMER OBSERVATIONS ON RECORD THAT A SIMILAR OPERATION OF GRA DUAL CONDENSATION IS ALSO TAKING PLACE AMONG CONDENSED CLUSTERS OF VISIBLE STARS AND CONSEQUENTLY TO RENDER IT PROBABLE THAT AN INTIMATE CONNEXION SUBSISTS BETWEEN THESE EXTREMES AND THAT THE SAME PRO CESS OF CONDENSATION CONTINUES FROM ONE END OF THE SERIES TO THE OTHER SO THAT THE MOST PERFECT STARS MAY POSSIBLY HAVE ORIGINATED FROM AN ACCUMULATION OF MERE NEBULOUS MATTER HIS FIRST OBSERVATIONS INDEED RELATE TO A MORE DIRECT COMMUNICA TION BETWEEN PRESENT STARS AND CONTIGUOUS NEBULOSITY IN DIFFERENT RELATIVE POSITIONS IN SOME INSTANCES A SINGLE STAR APPEARS TO BE ATTRACTING TO ITSELF A BRANCH OF NEBULOSITY SEEN EXTENDING FROM ONE OF ITS SIDES IN OTHERS TWO ADJACENT STARS APPEAR TO HAVE EQUAL POWER OVER A LINEAR PORTION OF NEBULA THAT EXTENDS FROM ONE TO THE OTHER THE PORTIONS OF NEBULA HOWEVER THAT ARE ADJACENT TO DIFFERENT SINGLE STARS VARY CONSIDERABLY IN THEIR APPEARANCE OF THOSE NEBU LOUS BRANCHES THAT EXTEND ONLY ON ONE SIDE SOME HAVE PARALLEL SIDES SOME ARE FANSHAPED OTHERS ARE IN A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE IRREGULAR SOME STARS HAVE EXTENDED NEBULOSITY ON OPPOSITE SIDES IN A LINE OF WHICH THEY OCCUPY THE CENTRE ROUND OTHERS IT APPEARS DIFFUSED EQUALLY AS IN A GLOBULAR FORM ON ALL SIDES AND IN SOME INSTANCES SUCH A GLOBULAR NEBULA APPARENTLY INCLUDES A CLUSTER OF SEVERAL STARS TOGETHER ALL THESE APPEARANCES AFFORD A PRESUMPTION THAT STARS AND NEBULAE ARE DRAWN TOGETHER BY MUTUAL ATTRACTION AND THAT THE ACCES SION OF SUCH A QUANTITY OF MATTER AS MUST BE CONTAINED IN AN EXTEN SIVE NEBULA WILL ULTIMATELY CAUSE WHAT MAY BE CALLED THE GROWTH OF STARS WHAT IN ITS FIRST STATE APPEARED AS A GLOBULAR NEBULA ALONE WOULD BY CONDENSATION PRESENT THE APPEARANCE OF A NUCLEUS IN ITS CENTRE THE GLOBULAR NEBULA WITH NUCLEUS WOULD BY INCREASING CON DENSATION BECOME A NEBULOUS STAR ITS NEXT STATE WOULD BE THAT OF A DISTINCT STAR WITH SURROUNDING NEBULOSITY AND THE LAST RESULT WOULD BE THE PERFECT SIMPLE STAR

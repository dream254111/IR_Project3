only is its foliage dense but its tapering spirelike crown offers but little resistance to falling snow In the light of the above facts forests may be too dense as well as too thin for the maxi mum conservation of snow The ideal forest seems to be one filled with glades whose area bears such proportion to the height of the trees that the wind and the sun can not reach the bottom These glades can be produced by the forester by judicious pruning and cutting as well as by proper planting However the mountain hemlock requires little or no prun ing to attain its maximum efficiency In the field of hydrology surveys of snow on the Mount Rose and Lake Tahoe water sheds have been made since the beginning of 1910 to indicate to ranchers and power com panies in the basin below the amount of water to expect during the season and thereby to as sure the better control of the reservoirs This work will be extended to include a study of the behavior of snow on typical slopes during ris ing temperature and wind with the view of forecasting the probability and extent of floods For the purpose of offering foresters in the national forests and others the ad vantage of the investigations in snow a course is now planned at the University of Nevada on the relation of mountains and forests to the conservation of snow including the improve ment of the storage of snow by the planting and pruning of forests to assure the control of stream flow and the increase of irrigation and power resources Other courses in general meteorology have already been provided The staff of the observatory consists of Pro fessor S P Fergusson formerly first assistant at Blue Hill Observatory who is associate meteorologist Mr Arthur L Smith observer in Lake Tahoe Basin and the writer who is in charge Besides annual reports and news bulletins the more important recent publications are Experiment Station Bulletin No 79 The Avoidance and Prevention of Frost in the Fruit Belts of Nevada and an article on the  Conservation of Snow Its Dependence on Forests and Mountains in Scientific Ameri can Supplement Vol LXXIV No 1914 Sep tember 7 1912 pp 15255 A bulletin con taining an elaborate presentation of the rela tion of mountains and forests to the conserva tion of snow is now being prepared J E CHURCH JR RENO NEVADA SPECIAL ARTICLES THE CULTIVATION OF AN ECTOPARASITIC NEMATODE OF A GUINEAPIG ON BACTERIOLOGIC MEDIA1 ON May 6 1912 while examining a guinea pig which had died of an unknown cause it was noted that the skin around and just an terior to the external genitalia was excoriated and covered by a yellowish cheesy exudate On examining the exudate under the low power a large number of actively motile em bryonic and adult nematodes were found On May 7 a second guineapig exhibiting a sim ilar but less extensive lesion and harboring the same ectoparasitic nematodes was discov ered Lately a third guineapig was encoun tered harboring the same nematode not only around the external genitalia but also on the normal skin of the abdomen and thorax Care ful examination of these and of a number of other guineapigs has failed to reveal the pres ence of the nematode in the gastrointestinal tract or in any of the internal organs A little of the caseous material from the first two guineapigs was inoculated onto moist earth and slants of Musgraves amceba agar and kept at room temperature about 24 C In a few days a large number of actively motile nematodes were found in these cultures The amoeba agar cultures have since then been carried through five sub cultures and the worms have also been suc cessfully carried through several subcultures on slants of plain agar and ascites agar The plain agar and the amoeba agar have proved to be the best media because the accompany ing bacterial growth is relatively limited in amount In several of the above subcultures A preliminary note from the laboratory of the Cincinnati Hospital 800 SCIENCEDECEMBERB 6 1912 the worm has been seen to pass through two complete cycles of development In one sub culture the worms have multiplied and re mained actively viable for 23 days without transplantation A striking peculiarity of the growth on the agar cultures is the tendency of the worms to crawl up on the side of the testtube opposite the slant and there clump themselves into macroscopic groups Under the low power these groups are seen to consist of an immense number of very actively motile nematodes in all stages of development As yet we have not determined the exact species of this nematode but in all probability it belongs to the Anguillulidae N BSince the above was written we have learned from Professor Henry B Ward of similar cultivation experiments carried out in his laboratory by H Metcalf2 WADE W OLIVER RECENTLY PROPOSED SPECIES OF THE GENUS DICERATHERIUM SINCE the opening of the Agate Spring fossil quarries in the Miocene formation of Sioux County Nebraska by the Carnegie Mu seum field parties some eight or nine years ago there has been great activity by many in stitutions and private parties in this general field As a consequence much material of fossil remains has been gathered of which the greater portion especially in the Agate Spring fossil quarries consists of bones pertaining to the Rhinocerotidse Pending the publication of a more extended work on the American Diceratheres now in progress the purpose of this note is to avoid the recurrence of certain interpretations on the part of students interested in the question of deciduous and permanent teeth In recent years there have been a number of new species described of Professor Marshs genus Diceratherium which will be duly con sidered later In 1908 Professor Loomis of 2 Cultural Studies of a Nematode Associated with Plant Decay Trans Amer Microscop Soc 1903 24 p 89 Amherst proposed a number of new forms1 One of these D aberrans p 59 is established on a second deciduous cheektooth of the left side Very recently Mr Harold J Cook has unfortunately used deciduous teeth as a type of still an additional species D loomisi2 The type of this latest species consists of a por tion of the right upper maxilla containing not P4 M1 and M2 as Cook states but the second the third and the fourth deciduous cheekteeth This is abundantly demonstrated in the large collection from the Agate Spring fossil quar ries now under study in the Carnegie Museum In this connection it is well to state that the formation of the permanent premolars 2 3 4 of Diceratherium starts comparatively late I have excavated maxillse Nos 2464 2476 Carnegie Museum of young specimens and often find that while the deciduous 2 3 and 4 are considerably worn the germ of P2 which is located immediately above the roots of D2 is only very slightly and more often not at all indicated At the same time Pl which is erupted in an early stage is on an even grind ing plane with the milk teeth and has received considerable wear more than half of the grinding surface of M1 appears through the alveolar border while M2 is represented by a large excavation immediately back of M2 In comparing Mr Cooks figures 1 c p 31 I judge that he has described a young specimen of D cooci in the stage of development de scribed above In a later stage of develop ment specimen No 1848 the formation of the permanent premolars is well advanced es pecially in 2 and 3 M1 is completely erupted M appears in a large triangular opening of the alveolar border while M8 is represented by a similar excavation to that of Nos 2464 and 2476 above described Thus it is repeat edly demonstrated that a large collection of a genus or species is extremely useful as a safe guard against the misinterpretations of which the systematists are surrounded 0 A PETERSON 1 American

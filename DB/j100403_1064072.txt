IN THE ACTIONS AT LAW AND THE PLAIN TIFFS WOULD BE SAVED THE NECESSITY OF COMBATING IT AND THUS MOST OF THE ACTIONS WOULD RESOLVE INTO MERE PROCEEDINGS TO ASSESS DAM AGES APPLICATION OF BULK SALES ACT TO THE TRANSFER OF A STOCK OF GOODS TO A CREDITOR IN SATISFACTION OF A DBTWHAT ARE COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE BULK SALES ACTS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN ENACTED IN MOST OF THE STATES THE DETAILS OF THESE STATUTES VARY SLIGHTLY BUT THEIR GENERAL PURPORT IS THAT A SALE IN BULK OR PORTION THEREOF NOT IN THE USUAL COURSE OF BUSINESS IS PRESUMED TO BE FRAUDULENT AND VOID UNLESS CERTAIN FORMALITIES EITHER OF RECORD OR NOTICE TO CREDITOR OR BOTH BE OBSERVED THE OBJECT OF THESE STATUTES IS TO PREVENT FRAUDS UPON CREDITORS WHICH A DEBTOR MIGHT EASILY PERPE TRATE BY CONCEALING THE CONSIDERATION RECEIVED FROM SUCH A SALE THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THESE ACTS WAS ATTACKED UPON THE GROUND THAT THEY MADE AN ARBITRARY CLASSIFICATION THAT THEY WERE CLASS LEGISLA TION AND THAT THEY DEPRIVED DEALERS OF THEIR PROPERTY WITHOUT DUE PROCESS OF LAW ALTHOUGH A FEW WERE HELD INVALID FOR THOSE REA SONS THE GREAT MAJORITY WERE FINALLY HELD CONSTITUTIONAL AC CORDINGLY SALES IN BULK NOT COMPLYING WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF NOTICE TO THE CREDITORS CONTAINED IN THE STATUTES ARE GENERALLY HELD TO BE FRAUDULENT AND VOID AS TO CREDITORS2 AS THESE ACTS ARE IN DEROGATION OF THE COMMON LAW THEY HAVE RE CEIVED A STRICT CONSTRUCTION SOME USE ONLY THE TERM SALE BUT MOST OF THEM PROVIDE FOR ANY SALE TRANSFER OR ASSIGNMENT OUT OF THE USUAL COURSE OF BUSINESS WHILE ON PRINCIPLE IT WOULD SEEM THAT THIS WOULD MAKE A MATERIAL DIFFERENCE IN THE APPLICATION YET IN MOST CASES THE TRANSACTION MUST PRACTICALLY COME WITHIN THE LEGAL DEFINITION OF A SALE IN ORDER FOR THE ACT TO APPLY HENCE IT HAS BEEN HELD THAT THE WORDS SALE TRANSFER OR ASSIGNMENT DO NOT IN CLUDE A CHATTEL MORTGAGE3 NOR A DEED OF TRUST TO SECURE CERTAIN CREDITORS4 A RECOGNIZED EXCEPTION OF THE APPLICATION OF THE BULK SALES ACT TO A SALE OF THE WHOLE

PARTNER SELLING HIS INTEREST TO HIS COPARTNER5 AS THE STOCK IS STILL LIABLE FOR THE CREDITORS CLAIMS IT BEING A MERE TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP AND NOT OF LIABILITY FROM ONE PARTNER TO THE OTHER THERE SEEMS TO BE NO REASON FOR THE APPLICATION OF THE ACT IN SUCH A CASE BUT THIS EXCEPTION IS LIMITED TO A SALE BETWEEN EXISTING PART NERS AND DOES NOT ALLOW A MERCHANT TO TAKE IN A PARTNER BY SELLING HIM AN INTEREST IN THE STOCK AND NOTICE OF SUCH A SALE MUST COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE ACT0 AS HAS BEEN SEEN THE MANIFEST PURPOSE OF THESE STATUTES IS TO PREVENT THE COMMISSION OF FRAUDS UPON CREDITORS BY FORBIDDING A MERCHANT TO CONVERT HIS STOCK INTO CASH OR OTHER CONSIDERATION WHICH HE MIGHT EASILY CONCEAL AND THUS DEFEAT THE CLAIMS OF HIS CREDITORS IT IS CLEAR THAT A SALE IN ITS STRICTLY LEGAL SENSE COMES WITHIN THE PUR VIEW OF ALL THE STATUTES AND IT WOULD LIKEWISE SEEM THAT A TRANSFER OF A STOCK TO A CREDITOR IN PAYMENT OF A DEBT WOULD ALSO BE INCLUDED ESPECIALLY WHERE THE ACT PROVIDES FOR A SALE ASSIGNMENT OR TRANS FER IN SUCH A CASE THE DEBTOR RECEIVES NO CASH OR OTHER CONSIDERA TION WHICH THE CREDITORS COULD IN ANY WAY SUBJECT TO THE PAYMENT OF THEIR CLAIMS WHILE THE AUTHORITIES ARE FEW SUCH A TRANSFER IS IT SEEMS MORE PROPERLY HELD TO COME WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE ACT7 AS THIS TRANSFER IS NOT A SALE IN THE USUAL COURSE OF BUSINESS SUCH HOLD INGS SEEM CORRECT ON PRINCIPLE BUT IN THE RECENT CASE OF DES MOINES PACKING CO V UNCAPHOR IOWA 156 N W 171 IT WAS HELD THAT AN ASSIGNMENT OF A STOCK TO A CREDITOR IN PAYMENT OF HIS CLAIM BY A SALE THEREOF WITH AN AGREEMENT TO PAY THE REMAINING SURPLUS TO THE DEBTOR DID NOT COME WITHIN THE ACT AND THE TRANSFER WAS VALID WITH OUT NOTICE TO OTHER CREDITORS THE COURT IN ITS OPINION SAID THAT THE IOWA ACT WAS NOT AS BROAD AS THOSE OF MASSACHUSETTS AND GEORGIA WHOSE COURTS HELD OTHERWISE THE IOWA STATUTE PROVIDED THAT NO RETAIL OR WHOLESALE MERCHANT COULD SELL ASSIGN OR DELIVER OUT OF THE USUAL COURSE OF BUSINESS WITHOUT NOTICE ETC WHILE THE MASSA CHUSETTS STATUTE INCLUDED ONLY A SALE OUT OF THE USUAL COURSE OF BUSINESS8 AND THE GEORGIA STATUTE PROVIDED FOR ANY SALE OR TRANS FER OUT OF THE USUAL

THAT OF EITHER MASSACHUSETTS OR GEORGIA AND THIS BASIS FOR THE DECISION SEEMS WHOLLY UNTENABLE AS THE TRANSACTION IN QUESTION WAS FOR THE CREDITOR TO TAKE THE STOCK AND SELL IT AND DEDUCT THE AMOUNT OF THE DEBT DUE HIM AND RETURN THE REMAINING PROCEEDS TO THE DEBTOR IT WAS TREATED AS ANALOGOUS TO A CHATTEL MORTGAGE AND NOT AS A SALE AND HENCE NOT WITHIN THE MEAN ING OF THE ACT OF COURSE THE TRANSACTION WAS NOT STRICTLY SPEAKING A SALE OR CHATTEL MORTGAGE BUT IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHY IT WOULD NOT COME WITHIN THE PROVISION OF THE IOWA ACT WHICH INCLUDED ANY TRANS ACTION TO SELL ASSIGN OR DELIVER EXTRATERRITORIAL OPERATION OF WORKMENS COMPENSATION ACTSWHERE A PROVISION AS TO ITS TERRITORIAL OPERATION IS INCLUDED IN A WORKMENS COMPENSATION ACT THIS PROVISION GOVERNS1 BUT WHERE THE ACT CONTAINS NO SUCH PROVISION THE QUESTION IS THEN ONE OF STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION AND IN CONSTRUING THESE ACTS THE COURTS HAVE TAKEN DIFFERENT VIEWS AS TO THEIR EXTRATERRITORIAL EFFECT IT HAS BEEN DECIDED THAT THE ENGLISH WORKMENS COMPENSATION ACT HAS NO APPLICATION TO INJURIES SUSTAINED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED KING DOM EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF SEAMEN2 A SECTION UNDER THIS ACT EX PRESSLY PROVIDES FOR ITS EXTRATERRITORIAL OPERATION IN THE CASES OF SEAMEN AND APPRENTICES3 THIS EXPRESS PROVISION SETTING FORTH ONE PARTICULAR CASE IN WHICH THE ACT SHALL OPERATE EXTRATERRITORIALLY IS THE CHIEF GROUND OF THE COURTS DECISION4 THE MASSACHUSETTS ACT HAS BEEN HELD NOT TO OPERATE OUTSIDE OF THAT STATE5 CERTAIN PECULIAR PROVISIONS OF THE MASSACHUSETTS LAW FURNISH ONE OF THE GROUNDS FOR THAT COURTS CONCLUSION IN THUS INTERPRETING THE STATUTE6 IT SEEMS APPARENT THAT THE ENGLISH AND MASSACHUSETTS DECISIONS AS TO THIS QUESTION ARE OF LITTLE VALUE AS PRECEDENTS BECAUSE OF THE SINGULAR PROVISIONS OF THE RESPECTIVE LAWS CONSTRUED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE QUESTION HAS ARISEN AND BEEN LITIGATED IN COURT THE VARIOUS ACTS HAVE BEEN CONSTRUED TO OPERATE EXTRATERRITORIALLY AND THUS TO EXTEND TO INJURIES INCURRED OUTSIDE OF THE STATE7 SUCH WAS THE HOLDING IN THE LATE CASES OF GOODING V OTT W VA 87 S E 862 AND POST V BURGER  GOHLKE N Y 111 N E 351 THESE HOLDINGS ARE SUSTAINED CHIEFLY ON THE THEORY THAT

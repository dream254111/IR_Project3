from the various states of the United States a note concerning the number of species in Texas may be of interest Texas is by considerable the largest state in the Union and this great size together with its peculiarly interme diate geographic position naturally lead us to expect a large and varied avifauna Nor does this expectation fail for the list of birds now known is decidedly larger than that of any other state amounting to 605 species and subspecies Of these 310 are perma nent residents that is they occur during both summer and winter at some place within the boundaries of the state though several of them do not so far as known breed with in its boundaries There are 78 summer residents which are species found during the summer at some locality in the state though not necessarily breeding but which do not pass the winter here Winter residents including all those that occur at this season in only one locality number 138 transients 42 casual visitors 23 and accidental visitors

savanna The bird when shot was clinging to some dry grass stalks growing in a swampy meadow enclosed by dikes This field formerly open salt marsh is near the north end of Woodley Island Hum boldt Bay California Mr J Grinnell examiled this sparrow in 1911 or 1912 and again in the fall of this year 1916 pronouncing it to be Passerculus s savanna Mr Grinnell wrote to me that as far as he was aware the Savannah Sparrow constitutes a new subspecies for the stateC I CLAY Eureka California December 25 1916 The Hooded Merganser in Stanislaus County CaliforniaLike many other spe cies of wild fowl this interesting bird Lophodytes cucullatus is becoming scarcer on the Pacific Coast and while still noted in some places it is seldom seen by most of us In fact it is something like thirty years since one has appeared within my horizon Hence it was a matter of surprise and pleasure to note a female of this species at the Rancho Dos Rios Stanislaus County California on October 26 1916 There was but a single individual feeding near a small bunch of Coots in a slough of seepage water something like a mile from the Tuolumne RiverJOSEPH MAILLIARD San Francisco Jan uary 17 1917 11   low 0 00

The one here given is very likely to have been thought of by other teachers and even published somewhere though I do not recall having run across it myself It is intended simply to show the com position of the birdlife of a locality at any one period of the year by sea sonal categories There are four of these Permanent Residents Summer Visitants Winter Visitants and Tran sients The portion of the annual cy cle in which each is present is shown and it becomes possible to demon strate the categories present in each one of the months Thus in January there are only the Permanent Residents plus the Winter Visitants and in April all the categories are presentJ GRINNELL University of California Berkeley February 13 1917Mar 1917 FROM FIELD AND STUDY 69 Notes on the Arizona Spotted OwlTwo specimens of Strix occidentalis lucida were taken by Mr E J Hands October 2 1915 at about 6500 feet altitude in Pinery Canyon west slope of the Chiricahua Mountains Cochise County Arizona They were male and female and sitting huddled close together on a fir limb The male Mr Hands reports was a little darker than the female which is now no 4441 collection of J E Law These are the first birds of this species noted by Mr Hands and his brother John Hands in the thirty years they have spent in these mountains as miners and rangers Compared with six specimens of S o occidentalis from southern California five from Los Angeles County no 494 coll C H Richardson nos 1392 1393 1395 coll G Willett no 1477 coll J E Law and one from Ventura County no 830 coll G Wil lett this female has very nearly the same tone of brown dorsally though nos 1392 and 1393 are slightly darker on hind neck but the light transverse bars of remiges and rec trices are conspicuously broader and whiter The southern California birds have these bars decidedly buffy The chest of the Arizonabird has conspicuous broad white bars giving predominance to the white coloration in striking contrast to the California birds which have the brown decidedly predominating on the chest In the Arizona bird the legs are slightly paler than in all the California specimens but no 1477 and the under side of tail remiges again has the white predominating as against the buffy of occi dentalisJ E LAW Hollywood California January 25 1917 Two Albino English SparrowsIn the museum collection of the Colorado State Agricultural College are two specimens of albino English Sparrows Passer domesticus One was taken at Fort Collins June 15 1915 the other at Las Animas January 5 1917 Both are males the Fort Collins specimen being an immature bird Both birds are pure white ncne of the feathers showing any trace of the normal colors eyes are pink and bills legs and feet fleshcolorW L BURNETT Colorado Agricultural College Fort Gol lins Colorado January 10 1917 Is the California Woodpecker a TipplerI once read that woodpeckers some times become intoxicated from drinking the fermented sap of certain trees I had thought that this might be only a dream of the nature fakirs but I have since seen something which leads me to suspect that the tale may have a foundation in fact In October 1911 I found a California Woodpecker Melanerpes formicivorus bairdi on the banks of the Sacramento River a few miles below Red Bluff which gave every evidence of being drunk It could use its wings for flight to a certain extent but could not steer a straight course in the air and soon fell to earth again when it tried to fly On the ground it tried to escape with uncertain sprawling motions I captured it and could find no injury though I examined it with some careW A SQUIRES San Francisco Jan uary 25 1917 Concerning two forms of the Bryant Marsh Sparrow in CaliforniaThe remarks of W A Squires in the NovemberDecember number of THE CONDOR upon the possibility of there being two forms of Passerculus sandwichensis bryanti in the vicinity of San Francisco Bay should bring out some observations or records from other parties and it is to be sincerely hoped that this will be the case The question is an interesting one and there seems a great likelihood that there really are two forms nearly alike but of different habits I have taken specimens of what I supposed was bryanti at different times and places high up on hills and ranges but except for the one mentioned in the notes from Humboldt Bay have never taken any at a high elevation in the height of the breeding season although a few were taken at dates very close to it These latter were supposed to be wanderers or nonbreeders at the time but recent events make me doubt this conclusion In our collection is a set of eggs taken by C A Allen at that time living at Nica sio Marin County California the data of which are as follows Western Savannah Sparrow Black Mt Marin Co Calif Apr 29 1877 Eggs fresh Nest on ground Male shot Nest on top of Mountain This is not the exact wording of the data but is the essence of it We did not see the parent of this set and have always been very skep tical concerning its identification or connection with the nest but have kept the set in abeyance all this time It looks now as if Allen might have been close to the truth and that the bird was this possible upland form As Allen sold all his skins at that time70 THE CONDOR Vol XIX this one is probably reposing in some eastern collection and if this note comes to the attention of any one who bought skins from him as far back as that I will esteem it a great favor if he will look the matter up and let me know Very likely this specimen is stowed away in some corner of the Biological Survey or National Museum in Washing ton D C Meanwhile this is an interesting matter open to all observers and this com ing spring will be a fine time to commence special investigations upon the question The Black Mountain mentioned is rather an isolated peak probably about 2000 feet high three or four miles north of Point Reyes Station mostly bare on the southerly and east erly sides and on topJOSEPH MAILLIARD San Francisco January 17 1917 The Arctic Horned Owl in the State of WashingtonPositive records of the Arc tic Horned Owl Bubo virginianus subarcticus for Washington are so scarce that it would seem advisable to mention all new ones in which the identity is certain It may consequently be of interest to know that a very fine one was recently in the possession of Mr Fred Edwards of Tacoma It was taken at Skagit Skagit County Washington and on account of its large size I should say that it is in all probability a female Mr Edwards is uncertain regarding the exact date of its capture but thinks it was in the winter of 1902 The horned owls taken during the winter in Washington show such a wide range of variation that some might easily pass for subarcticus were it not for the more or less distinct bars of dusky on the feathers of the legs and feet The specimen under discus sion is one of the lightest in color that I have ever seen the markings being paler than in many specimens of the Snowy OwlJ H BOWLES Tacoma Washington January 17 1917 An Invasion of California by the Eastern GoshawkThree Goshawks were re ceived at the California Museum of Vertebrate Zoology during the past autumn each of which I have identified as belonging to the subspecies Astur atricapillus atricapillus thus adding a new name to the state list of birds The

of the above three birds by which they uniformly differ from the ordinary Western Goshawk Astur atricapillus striatulus lie in the general paleness of coloration This analyzed consists in ashy tone of upper surface dorsum slategray of Ridgway 1912 instead of dark neutral gray as in striatulus markings every where beneath paler and narrower streaks on throat and chest mere lines not more than one millimeter in width mostly less one to three millimeters wide in striatulus flanks notably more lightly barred than in striatulus In all these characters the three birds designated agree accurately with specimens from the eastern United States and from northeastern Alaska these latter being unquestionable atricapillus All other birds examined from California Oregon and southeastern Alaska are striatulus Reports of the capture or observation of fully twentyfive other Goshawks have come in this winter from various localities from one end of the state to the other Where age has been specified only adults are concerned no birdsoftheyear have come to no tice The present announcement of the occurrence of atricapillus in California at once brings doubt as to the subspecies involved in all previous winter records of Goshawks for the state Striatulus is evidently the breeding bird in the Canadian zone within theMar 1917 FROM FIELD AND STUDY 71 state there are summer specimens at hand to prove it It is quite likely that birds of this relatively resident race scatter out over the lower territory to a greater or less ex tent in winter and thus it may be that all of the Goshawks recorded rather rarely in usual years and some of the Goshawks this year belong to the race striatulus But there is good ground for suspecting that there has been the past winter an invasion of California and probably most other western states by the extreme northern and east ern race atricapillus and that such an invasion is of very infrequent occurrence In the Auk xxxIv 1917 pp 8788 C D Bunker reports that a flight of Amer ican Goshawks has visited Kansas the past fall from October 27 to November 20 1916 nine specimens were brought in to the Museum of the University of Kansas The coinci dence of these dates with those of the Californiataken specimens is noteworthy In this connection this years invasion by the Snowy Owl into northern California is also of interest see Bryant Calif Fish and Game In 1917 pp 3738 It is possible that the Eastern Goshawks and the Snowy Owls came from the same summer home and that their unusually extended autumnal exodus was due to the same cause This cause may be supposed to have been a lessening supply of food rodents and birds succeeding a period of plenty when the owl and hawk population had augmented above its normal J GRINNELL Berkeley California February 13 1917 Del Norte County Bird NotesAugust 13 1916 proved not a day of evil omen the 13th but rather a most pleasant one and producing interesting notes Through the kind ness of Martin Lund the well known diver who was looking for lost treasure claimed to be on the Brother Jonathan when she sank off Point St George about fifty years ago I was placed by those on his launch on Castle Island off Point St George and three miles north from Crescent City Despite the fact that eighteen head of sheep roam over the broken flat on the north slope the Kaeding Petrel Oceanodroma kaedingi is nesting there to the number of a thousand or more and often their burrows are dug right in the sheeps trails On the steep crags to the north and oceanwards I counted fortythree nests of the Baird Cor morant Phalacrocorax p resplendens from one position The Tufted Puffin Lunda cirrhata was nesting in colonies and scattered pairs in suitable places along the rim of the hundred foot bluff The top of Castle Island is accessible only at the northeast end and towards the mainland It covers several acres reaching its highest point at the southwest where a row of pinnacles forms a barren ridge the nesting site of numerous Westeirh Gulls Larus occidentalis Nests of cormorants puffins and gulls all contained large young From a number of gulls nests the young had flown but those of cormorants and puffins contained birds in every instance The petrels had nearly all left the nests At the landing the water was dotted with exposed rocks several rising some thirty feet high the largest a continuation of the main island that could be reached by jump ing from boulder to boulder at low water At the waters edge on the main rock and on the one just mentioned I found two nests of the Pigeon Guillemot Cepphus columba each containing two large young While I was sitting at the waters edge two Wander ing Tattlers Heteractitis incanus quietly appeared through a crevice between the rocks and stood erect eying me at a distance of exactly six feet While sitting in the same place where the tattlers had appeared eating lunch and watching the California Murres Uria troille californica travelling between Castle Rock and the one at my back I observed a flock of about a dozen turnstones fly by Most interesting of all though were the actions of five Black Oystercatchers Haematopus bachmani They sat close together on a nearby rock alert and with their occasional calls accompanied by the sudden uplifting of the forward part of their bodies When I moved the piping became more frequent and when I arose and moved in the birds direc tion they circled about alighting on a nearby rock and again on the one from which they had flown Grinnells Distributional List of the Birds of California gives Trinidad Hum boldt County as the only locality in California where this species is known to occur north of the Farallon Islands and Point Reyes Castle Island off Point St George is probably the northernmost rock of any size on the California coast so the birds I saw probably hold the northern record for the stateC I CLAY Eureka California Decem ber 25 1916

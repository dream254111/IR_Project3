and a good collection of birds and mammals was secured The scarcity of birds in certain sections of the country was very noticeable The islands are all heavily wooded and as they rise abruptly from the water traveling was at times very difficult A curious Indian legend relative to the hooting of the Sooty Grouse was related by Mr Swarth The Indians believe that the Raven is the lord of all the birds and also that at one time both the Sooty and Spruce Grouse hooted thus making a great noise in the woods The Raven did not fancy so much noise so he forbade the Spruce Grouse to do any hooting and it has forever since remained silent Mr M S Ray presented a paper on A Defense of Oology see this issue of the CON DOR page 19 and the same was discust by those present Adjourned H W CARRIGER

morning and most of the day was spent on the island where the gull and auklet colonies were examined Many young of the Western Gull were seen running about the nesting colonies None of the young observed were able to fly but all used their legs to good advantage Two nests of the Western Gull containing two eggs each were found but as they appeared to be badly incubated they were not molested A nest and four eggs of the Island Horned Lark was taken by Mr Antonin Jay and Mr Lelande reported finding the San Clemnente House Finch breeding Leaving Santa Barbara Island about 3 p m the trip was made to San Nicolas Island reach ingcthe sand spit at the southeast end of the island about 8 p ti Sunday July 4 was spent on the island by most of the party some of whom walkt around the island and examined the Cormorant rookeries and the Indian burial grounds On returning to the landing it was found that the sea was so rough that it would be impossible to land a skiff so all hands turned to and collected firewood and were soon comfortable with a roaring fire in one of the caves above the tide line A hearty repast was made from one five cent package of chewing gum and while a more substantial meal would have been appreciated by the 11 left on shore no one complained of the lack of food but all were unanimous in their desire for drinking water However no one suffered all taking it good naturedly as tho it was part of the days work Monday morning the wind having gone down the skiff was landed easily and we reacht the launch with little trouble After a hearty breakfast much enjoyed by all Mr Linton and 0 WV Howard returned to shoreJan 1910 MINUTES OF COOPER CLUB MEETINGS 51 to find Lintons father who was camping at Northwest Harbor We expected this would take but a short time but as it developt it took all day and as the wind again blew as strong as the day before they were compelled to stay all night on shore On Tuesday July 6 after picking up Linton and Howard we started for Northwest Harbor and there found Linton Sr and after taking him aboard started for Long Beach which was reacht about 10 p m Many birds were found on both islands On Santa Barbara Island several nesting colonies were visited of both Western Gull and Cassin Auklet while on San Nicolas Island many gulls and cormorants were found but no auklet burrows were discovered A large number of Island Horned Larks San Clemente House Finches and a song sparrow of some species were noted on both islands Eighteen species of birds were seen on Santa Barbara Island and fourteen on San Nicolas besides

City Hall Los Angeles Thursday even ing Sept 2 1909 with members Evan Davis Win B Judson Pingree I Osburn Chester C Lamb Howard Robertson Prof Loye Holmes Miller H J Lelande Ozra W Howard Antonin Jay Alphonse Jay W Lee Chambers Geo Willett and J E Law present and as a guest Dr A K Fisher who is in charge of the Economic Investigations of the Bureau of Biological Survey United States Department of Agriculture The evening was spent in an informal talk by Dr Fisher outlining his work Interesting data was given in regard to extensive experi ments for extermination of destructive rodents Interesting data concerning bird destruction was presented The Smithsonian Institution has accumulated from the entire world 225000 bird skins in 55 years Careful data indicates that in one storm more than 2000000 birds were destroyed in an area of 20 miles and yet subsequent years showed no apparent decrease in the number of individuals of the species killed in this area Some years ago the Blue bird was almost exterminated in the eastern states by severe weather In a few years the Bluebird was as abundant as ever Statistics prove that the domestic cat destroys more birds than all natural enemies combined These statistics bear directly on the tendency today of so restricting ornithologists that intelligent research is almost prohibited The 5000 or 10000 birds accumulated in a lifetime by the average sincere ornithologist can make no im pression whatever on the bird population It seems only reasonable that ornithologists be protected in their collecting privileges Ad journed J

W PrestonNotes on the Northwestern Crossbill  and the other by Mr J Grinnell A new Cowbird of the Genus Molothrus Mr R Magoon Barnes one of our Eastern members of Lacon Ill gave a short talk of decided interest to the members dwelling particularily on his aviary of wild ducks The members plied Mr Barnes with questions and he very goodnaturedly answered them all Mr Barnes has succeeded in raising a large number of wild ducks from the eggs and in keeping them in confinement he finds the Woodduck easiest but Mallard Black Mallard and all pondducks readily adjust themselves to domestic conditions and become very tame He has also raised the Wild Geese and finds them all fairly sensible excepting the Canada Geese which he says have not sense enough to go under shelter even when the thermometer is 20 degrees below zero He says they seem to pick the coldest windiest spot they can find and just stay there No artificial heat is re quired until the thermometer goes beyond 10 degrees below zero and in the very cold weather that is when more that 20 degrees be low the ducks are not allowed to go into water Dampness seems to be a great deal more fatal than cold AdjournedJ E LAw

POSSESSION OF THE LANDS IN CONTROVERSY OR SOME PART THEREOF SINCE THE EMANATION OF THE ELDER PATENT FOR THE TIME OF LIMITATION FIXED BY THE STATUTE THE ACTION OF THE TRIAL COURT IN REFUSING TO GIVE INSTRUCTION D WAS THEREFORE RIGHT AS IT SEEMS TO US BOTH UPON PRINCIPLE AND AUTHORITY THE NEXT AND REMAINING ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR IS TO THE ACTION OF THE COURT IN REFUSING TO GIVE INSTRUCTIONS A AND B OFFERED BY THE PLAINTIFFS IN ERROR AND WHICH ARE IN THE FOLLOWING WORDS A THE COURT FURTHER INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT IF THEY BELIEVE FROM THE EVIDENCE THAT THE LAND IN CONTROVERSY IS COVERED BY THE FIELDS PATENT OF 19390 ACRES THEY WILL FIND FOR THE DEFENDANTS AND IN DETERMINING THIS QUESTION THEY SHOULD BE GUIDED BY WHAT IS OR WHAT BY THE LAW IS DEEMED TO BE THE MOST CERTAIN EVIDENCE THAT IS A WHEN CORNER TREES ARE CALLED FOR AND FOUND THE LINES OF SAID PATENT MUST BE RUN TO AND FROM SUCH CORNERS REGARD LESS OF COURSE AND DISTANCE B WHERE CORNER TREES ARE CALLED FOR BUT NOT FOUND NOR THE PLACE AT WHICH THEY STOOD LOCATED THEN THE LINES RUNNING TO AND FROM SUCH CORNERS SHOULD BE DE TERMINED BY THE COURSES AND DISTANCES CALLED FOR IN THE PATENT PROVIDED SUCH COURSES AND DISTANCES WILL RUN TO THE NEXT LOCATED CORNER C BUT IF SUCH COURSES AND DISTANCES WILL NOT RUN TO THE NEXT LOCATED CORNER THEN DISTANCE MUST GIVE WAY TO COURSE AND THE LINES BETWEEN LOCATED CORNERS MUST BE ESTABLISHED AND LOCATED BY LENGTHENING OR SHORTENING THE SAME SO AS TO RUN FROM ONE LOCATED CORNER TO THE NEXT LOCATED CORNER WITHOUT CHANGING THE COURT OF ANY OF THE SAID LINES B THE COURT FURTHER INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT IF THEY ARE SATISFIED FROM THE EVIDENCE AS TO THE TRUE LOCATION OF THE LAST CORNER OF THE FIELDS PATENT THEN THE LAST LINE OF SAID PATENT SHOULD BE LOCATED BY RUNNING A STRAIGHT LINE BETWEEN SUCH LAST CORNER AND THE FIRST CORNER OF SAID PATENT REGARDLESS OF COURSE AND DIS TANCE BUT IF ON THE OTHER HAND THEY ARE UPON ALL THE EVIDENCE IN THE CASE IN DOUBT AS TO THE TRUE LOCATION OF SAID CORNER THAT IS IF THEY ARE NOT SATISFIED BY A PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE AS TO THE TRUE LOCATION THEREOF THEY ARE ENTITLED AND IT IS THEIR DUTY TO LOCATE SAID LAST LINE BY REVERSING FROM SAID FIRST CORNER ON THE DEGREE CALLED FOR IN SAID PATENT AFTER ALLOWING FOR THE VARIATION OF THE NEEDLE PROPER AT THIS DATE IT IS CONCEDED THAT INSTRUCTION A IS A CORRECT STATEMENT OF LAW EXCEPT IN SO FAR AS IT DECLARES THAT WHERE CORNERS ARE NEITHER FOUND NOR LOCATED DISTANCE MUST GIVE WAY TO COURSE AND THE LINES BE TWEEN LOCATED CORNERS MUST BE ESTABLISHED BY LENGTHENING OR SHORTENING THE SAME SO AS TO RUN FROM ONE LOCATED CORNER TO ANOTHER WITHOUT CHANGING THE COURSE OF ANY OF THE LINES WHILE IT MAY BE AS ARGUED THAT CHAIN CARRIERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO MAKE MISTAKES IN MEASURING THE DISTANCE THAN THE SURVEYOR 1907 73512 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER IS IN ASCERTAINING THE COURSE IN SURVEYING LAND THERE IS NO ARBI TRARY RULE THAT DISTANCE MUST ALWAYS YIELD TO COURSE WHERE ONE OR THE OTHER MUST BE DISREGARDED IN SMITH V CHAPMAN 10 GRAT 445 IT WAS SAID BY JUDGE LEE IN DELIVERING THE OPINION OF THE COURT THAT TO SAY THAT DISTANCE SHALL YIELD TO COURSE OR VICE VERSA WHERE THERE IS A CONFLICT BE TWEEN THE DISTANCE OF ONE LINE AND THE TRUE COURSE OF ANOTHER WOULD BE ENTIRELY ARBITRARY AND THE TRUE RULE SEEMS TO BE THAT ONE OR THE OTHER SHALL BE PREFERRED ACCORDING TO THE

92 VA 253 MADE A CONSIDERABLE STRIDE TOWARD THE SOLUTION OF THE QUESTION THIS CASE WOULD SEEM TO FINALLY PUT AT REST ALL CONTROVERSY AS TO WHETHER THE JUNIOR PATENTEE MUST HAVE ACTUAL POSSESSION OF THE INTERLOCK OR WHETHER A MERE ADVERSE CLAIM WILL SUFFICE THE COURT DECIDES THAT THERE MUST BE AN ACTUAL INVASION OF THE BOUNDARY OF THE SENIOR PATENTEE BY SOME ACT OR ACTS PALPABLE TO THE SENSES AND WHICH WOULD SERVE TO ADMONISH HIM THAT HIS SEISIN IS MOLESTED TO OUST HIM AND THAT A MERE ADVERSE CLAIM HOWEVER CONNECTED WITH POSSESSION OF ANOTHER PART OF THE LAND WILL NOT HAVE THAT EFFECT IN

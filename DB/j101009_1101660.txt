Circuit Court Lee County Action by E M Pennington against James Green and others From a judgment in favor of plaintiff defendants bring error Affirmed Pennington Bros C 7 Duncan and Bullitt  Kelley for plaintiffs in error R T Irvine for defendant in error BUCHANAN J The action of the court in refusing to give instruction D offered by the plaintiffs in error defendants in the trial court is assigned as error By that instruction the court was asked in substance to tell tlhe jury that where a deed includes in part vacant land which has never been granted by the commonwealth and the grantee in the deed takes actual possession of a part of the tract but outside of the land of the commonwealth claiming title to the whole tract his possession extends to the boundaries of his deed and that if he continues such possession and adverse claim for the statutory period after the emanation of a grant by the com monwealth of her land covered by this deed his claim will have 732 JanGREtN V PENNINGTON ripened into a good title and the right of her grantee to recover the same will be barred As a general proposition it is no doubt true that actual posses sion of a part of a tract of land under color and claim of title to the whole is possession of the whole and that this principle ap plies to the lands of the commonwealth as against persons not lawfully claiming under her This proposition of law was recog nized and in part made the basis of the right of the plaintiff in Olinger v Shepherd 12 Grat 462 an action of unlawful entry and detainer to recover the possession of lands belonging to the commonwealth against the defendant who was held to be a mere trespasser That case does not however as the plaintiffs in error insist sustain their contention in this case but on the contrary Judge Moncure who delivered the opinion of the court said it was unnecessary to inquire what would have been the relative rights of the parties if the defendant had obtained a patent for the land in controversy before the institution of that action 12 Grat 474 Where one grant conflicts in part with another occasioning what is called a lap or interlock the elder patentee under his grant acquires at once constructive seisin in deed of all the land embraced within its boundaries although he has taken no actual possession of any part thereof The junior grantee under his grant acquires similar constructive seisin in deed of all the land embraced by his boundaries except that portion within the interlock the seisin of which had already vested in the senior grantee Koiner v Rankins Heirs 11 Grat 427 and cases cited In this state of the case as was said by Judge Lee speaking for the court in the case of Koiner v Rankin supra if the junior patentee settle upon that portion of the land within the interlock claiming the whole within his boundary he thereby ousts the senior patentee of his constructive seisin and becomes actually possessed to the extent of his grant IHere possession of part is possession of the whole But if his settlement be outside of the interlock there possession of part is to be construed in reference to the conflict of boundaries and with whatever claim it be taken it gives him possession of that part of the land only lying without the interlock Of that within he does not thereby acquire possession The constructive possession which he would have gained if there had been no conflict does not take effect and there is nothing which can serve to overcome the con structive seisin in deed of the elder patentee and work an ouster To effect this there must be an actual invasion of the boundary of the senior patentee by some act or acts palpable to the senses and which would serve to admonish him that his seisin was molested He is of course presumed to know his own bound ary and if that be invaded by plain open visible acts of pos 1907 73312 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER session on the part of the other and he submits or fails to assert his right an ouster will be accomplished and he shall be said to be disseised But if the acts be not of the character above in dicated if they amount to a mere adverse claim however con nected with possession of another part of the land they will not have that effect The consequence of a different rule as justly remarked by Judge Baldwin in Taylor v Burnsides 1 Grat 165 169 would be that a man might be disseised of his freehold not only without his knowledge but even without the possibility of knowing it 11 Grat 427 428 The reasoning of Judge Lee applies with equal if not more force to a case where one of the conflicting claimants to the interlock or lap does not claim under color of title from the commonwealth The fact that such a claimant was in the un lawful occupancyof the interlock or lap at the date the common wealths grant emanated cannot affect the question It is conceded and if it were not it is well settled that the rights of the commonwealth cannot be affected by any kind of possession of her land Gore v Lawson 8 Leigh 458 Overtons Heirs v Davisson 1 Grat 211 42 Am Dec 544 Shanks v Lancaster 5 Grat 110 50 Am Dec 108 Koiner v Rankin supra Olinger v Shepherd supra If neither actual nor constructive possession of her land can affect the rights of the commonwealth it follows that such possession cannot affect the rights of her grantee The estate of the commonwealth is divested by her grant and vested in the patentee Such grant confers title on her grantee and neces sarily seisin one of the essential requisites of complete title Dawson v Watkins 2 Rob 268 Overton v Davisson supra Koiner v Rankin supra The grant therefore put the first patentee of the land con structively into possession notwithstanding at the time of its emanation there may have been actual occupation of the premises by another person for such persons possession since the com monwealth is incapable of being disseised cannot be adversary 2 Minors Inst 1st Ed 565 566 and cases cited and being in the constructive possession of the premises he cannot be disseised or ousted except by an actual invasion of his boundary by some act or acts palpable to the senses and which will serve to admonish him that his seisin is molested otherwise as was said by Judge Baldwin he might be disseised of his freehold not only without his knowledge but without the possibility of his knowing it Although the question was not discussed by the court in Over ton v Davisson supra an instruction was approved which told the jury that in a controversy between parties claiming land under the elder and junior patentees respectively the party claiming under the latter to protect his possession by the defense of the 734 JanGREEN V PZNNINGTON satute of limitations must show an actual possession of the lands in controversy or some part thereof since the emanation of the elder patent for the time of limitation fixed by the statute The action of the trial court in refusing to give instruction D was therefore right as it seems to us both upon principle and authority The next and remaining assignment of error is to the action of the court in refusing to give instructions A and B offered by the plaintiffs in error and which are in the following words A The court further instructs the jury that if they believe from the evidence that the land in controversy is covered by the Fields patent of 19390 acres they will find for the defendants and in determining this question they should be guided by what is or what by the law is deemed to be the most certain evidence that is a When corner trees are called for and found the lines of said patent must be run to and from such corners regard less of course and distance b Where corner trees are called for but not found nor the place at which they stood located then the lines running to and from such corners should be de termined by the courses and distances called for in the patent provided such courses and distances will run to the next located corner c But if such courses and distances will not run to the next located corner then distance must give way to course and the lines between located corners must be established and located by lengthening or shortening the same so as to run from one located corner to the next located corner without changing the court of any of the said lines B The court further instructs the jury that if they are satisfied from the evidence as to the true location of the last corner of the Fields patent then the last line of said patent should be located by running a straight line between such last corner and the first corner of said patent regardless of course and dis tance but if on the other hand they are upon all the evidence in the case in doubt as to the true location of said corner that is if they are not satisfied by a preponderance of the evidence as to the true location thereof they are entitled and it is their duty to locate said last line by reversing from said first corner on the degree called for in said patent after allowing for the variation of the needle proper at this date It is conceded that instruction A is a correct statement of law except in so far as it declares that where corners are neither found nor located distance must give way to course and the lines be tween located corners must be established by lengthening or shortening the same so as to run from one located corner to another without changing the course of any of the lines While it may be as argued that chain carriers are more likely to make mistakes in measuring the distance than the surveyor 1907 73512 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER is in ascertaining the course in surveying land there is no arbi trary rule that distance must always yield to course where one or the other must be disregarded In Smith v Chapman 10 Grat 445 it was said by Judge Lee in delivering the opinion of the court that to say that distance shall yield to course or vice versa where there is a conflict be tween the distance of one line and the true course of another would be entirely arbitrary and the true rule seems to be that one or the other shall be preferred according to the manifest in tent of the parties and the circumstances of the case Citing Prestons Heirs v Bowmar 2 Bibb Ky 493 Loring v Nor ton 8 Greenl Me 61 Scamman v Sawyer 4 Greenl Me 429 which sustain the statement of the rule laid down by him as do the later cases of Clements v Kyles 13 Grat 468 and Ruff ner v Hill 31 W Va 434 7 S E 13 The instruction was properly refused Neither did the court err in refusing to give instruction B It required the jury in locating the last line and the last corner to adhere to the course and to fix the corner without regard to the topography of the ground at the corner as described in the title papers which was manifestly erroneous We are of opinion that there is no error in the judgment com plained of to the prejudice of the plaintiffs in error and that it must be affirmed KEITH J absent Note When we read the decision in this case the reasoning seems so convincing and the opinion of the court so clear and cogent that we marvel how any difference of opinion could ever have existed as to the conflicting rights of the true and colorable title holder of land within the interlock nevertheless this question has been the subject of many able and interesting articles in the Register in which different views have been taken and if in the language of Mr Minor in his able article in 3 Va Law Register 843 The decision of Stull v Rich Patch Iron Co 92 Va 253 made a considerable stride toward the solution of the question this case would seem to finally put at rest all controversy as to whether the junior patentee must have actual possession of the interlock or whether a mere adverse claim will suffice The court decides that there must be an actual invasion of the boundary of the senior patentee by some act or acts palpable to the senses and which would serve to admonish him that his seisin is molested to oust him and that a mere adverse claim however connected with possession of another part of the land will not have that effect In connection with the opinion in the principal case we call atten tion to the following articles in the Register in addition to the one by Mr Raleigh C Minor mentioned above The Open Question by Mr H C McDowell Jr in 3 Va Law Register 763 which is answered by Mr Minor in the same volume Adversary Possession or the Open Question in Virginia by Mr F W Sims 4 Va Law Reg 1 Others will be found referred to in a note to Fry v Stowers 6 Va Law Register 262 Jan 736

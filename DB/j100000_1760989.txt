cotton insulation It was wound on a warm rainy day and tested immediately showing the strongest polarization found driving the spotof light violently off the scale The coil was then baked in a hotair oven at 1500  for an hour and tested again when cool No trace of polariza tion could then be found though the charging cur rent was increased The previous observations of course indicated electrolytic polarization as the dis turbing cause aind the last showed that in the case of that coil it was electrolysis of water absorbed from the air by the cotton insulation The experi mental coil was then heated and soaked well with pure paraffine and drained while hot until it seemed to be as nearly as possible in the same condition as the 40000 Elliott coil and tested when cool No trace of polarization was shown It was then put aside in the instrument case to see whether it could still absorb water enough to polarize Ten days later just after the Buffalo meeting the coil was tested again and polarized strongly On heating it again the polarization entirely disappeared A drop of hydrant water placed on the coil caused polariza tion to reappear in five seconds and in five minutes the effect was so strong as to drive the needle to its stops The degree of error in measurement resulting from polarization was not examined but Professor Men denhalls statements show that it may be a consider able quantity It is obvious that unparaffined coils are on this ac count unsuited to the best work also that coils well paraffined as in the BA unit coil or coils freshly baked and paraffined are free from such error The paraffining of ordinary coils even when as thoroughly done as by the Elliotts is not a perma nent protection probably because of cracking of the mass of paraffine allowing vapor to reach the wire and insulation A test will quickly determine the condition of any particular coil A box might be made proof against polarization by filling entirely the space about the freshly baked coils with pure paraffine just warm enoughto flowfreely Tempera ture difficulties could be in part overcome by thermo junctions as in standards Another and on some accounts better plan would be to mount the coils in an impervious box with liquidtight joints and fill ing the interior with a petroleum oil which may readily be found in market of such quality as to exhibit no polarization With such a box there need be no uncertainty as to the temperature of the coils BENJ F THOMAS Columbus O Dec 27 Atmospheric lines in the solar spectrum The ingenious device recently published by Mr Conner for detecting the lines in the solar spectrum due to the earths atmosphere recalls a similar plan proposed by the writer some years ago In a letter dated Feb 21 1883 I wrote to Professor Rowland I hope that you will try the experiment of which I spoke to you last summer  forming two images of the sun and photographing the spectra of the oppo site limbs A glance would serve to distinguish the solar from the telluric lines An accompanying sketch showed that a doubleimage prism was to be placed between the slit and a lens forming an image VCE 13 of the sun upon it This prism was to be moved until the two images were in contact The east and west limbs were thus brought together and the slit was placed at right angles to their line of junction In the photograph telluric lines should cross the spectrumr undeviated while solar lines would be bent in opposite directions where they crossed the line of separation of the two spectra The advantages of this method over that of Mr Conner are first its simplicity as it is easily tried by any one who has a spectroscope giving a sufficient diffusion secondly the solar lines instead of becoming hazy continue well defined For these reasons I call attention to the matter and not to detract from the credit due to the eminent French physicist who has preceded me both in trying and publishing a solution of this very important problem EDWARD C PIcKERING Harvard coll observ Jan 1 1887 A brilliant meteor On Jan 3 1887 at 515 PM I observed a meteor of unusual brilliancy It started as nearly as I could make out from the constellation Ursa Minor pos sibly a little higher up moving with a rapid rush and brilliant light in an easterly direction As it neared the horizon its speed apparently diminished until it disappeared behind some trees It was visi ble fully thirty seconds and during the last part of its flight appeared to float slowly downwards A trail of considerable length was drawn behind giving it the appearance of a large rocket Its flight was unattended by any sound R W WOOD Jr Jamaica Plain Miass What was the rose of Sharon  I notice in your issue of Dec 31 an article on the rose of Sharon Without desiring to enter into the discussion of this subject I wish to refer those in terested to a few words upon this subject by an emi nent investigator Speaking of that part of the pleistocene plain near Jaffa bordering the Mediter ranean Sea Sir J W Dawson in his recent work on  Egypt and Syria says  In February we found it gay with the beautiful crimson anemone A coro naria which we were quite willing to accept as the  rose of Sharon while a little yellowishwhite iris of more modest appearance growing along with it represented the  lilyofthevalley  of Solomons song From this would it not be reasonable to in fer that this anemone is quite generally recognized as the  rose of Sharon  AMos W BUTLER Brookville Ind Jan 31887 Electrical phenomena on a mountain In confirmation of the observations of M F Science viii p

THE BOLYAI PRIZE AMERICA will rejoice that at last Hungary is honoring herself in honoring her wonder child John Bolyai His marvel diamond the most extraordinary two dozen pages in the history of human thought appeared in America in English before it appeared in Hungary in Magyar proud as they are of N S VOL XXII No 557 their language and more the American was reproduced entire in Japan before even the original was reproduced in Hungary An American not a European was the first from outside Hungary to make the journey to MarosVasarhely only for John Bolyais sake and to see there the letter in Magyar which constitutes his preemption claim and titledeed to the new universe and to publish for the first time that letter making the date 1823 ever memorable On its publication thus in America Charles S Peirce wrote in The Na tion MAarch 17 1892 p 212 in a review of Halsteds Bolyai There is a winningly enthusiastic letter from Bolyai Jdnos to his father telling him of the great step He says I have discovered such magnificent things that I am myself astonished at them It would be damage eternal if they were lost When you see them my father you will yourself acknowledge it At present I can not say more than that from nothing I have created a wholly new world Ten years later this letter was published in IHungary in Magyar and Latin and now comes the establishment of the great Bolyai prize Prix Bolyai by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences of which the statutes are as follows 1 On the occasion of the hundredth anniversary of the birth of John Bolyai the Hungarian Acad emy of Sciences wishing to perpetuate the memory of this illustrious scientist as likewise that of the profound thinker Farkas Bolyai his father and teacher has decided to establish a prize to be called the Bolyai Prize This prize which is to consist of a commemorative medalwhose ob verse will represent the academy with the view of Budapest and whose reverse will bear an in scriptionand of a sum of ten thousand crowns shall be adjudged for the first time in 1905 then every five years to the author of the best work in mathematics published during the five preceding years The prize may be given to any work deemed worthy of it whatever the language in which it be written and in whatever form it be published The announcement of the winner will take place during the general meeting of the academy in December 2 In case the work of a deceased author be deemed worthy the prize this shall be given to his heirs 3 The third section of the academy section ofSCIE CNCE sciences is entrusted with constituting at its March meeting a committee composed of two home and two foreign members whose duty it shall be to judge of the value of the works The committee will meet at Budapest in the first fort night of October and name from their number a president and a reporter In case of a tie the presidents vote is pre ponderant It shall be the duty of the reporter to present a detailed report on the committees decision This report is to be read at the general meet ing of the Academy of Sciences the day the prize is adjudged 4 The works of authors on the committee are excluded from the competition and they are not to be mentioned in the committees report 5 The foreign members designated as part of the committee and who participating in the delib erations will spend some days at Budapest shall receive a compensation of 1000 crowns The honorarium accorded to the reporter for his work is fixed at 300 crowns 6 The report is to be published in the journal Akademiai Ertesito The Hungarian Academy of Sciences will publish this report abroad and will make it known to all the associated acad emies In accordance with the above statutes in the course of this present year the Hungarian Academy of Sciences will confer for the first time the Bolyai Prize consisting of a medal and ten thousand crowns The commission constituted by the acad emy from its members and endowed with the powers of a jury consists of Gaston Darboux Paris Felix Klein Gottingen Julius Konig Budapest Gustav Rados Buda pest The deliberations of this commission will be held this October in Budapest If I may be forgiven for a bit of prophecy I venture to predict the prize goes to Poincare GEORGE BRUCE HALSTED KENYON COLLEGE GAMBIER OHIO SPECIAL ARTICLES ON THE PROBABLE ORIGIN OF CERTAIN BIRDS IT is my purpose to examine in this article the status of nine kinds of birds that have been recorded from North America and one that has been taken in southern Europe and 271 to discuss in some detail their relationship and probable origin Appended to the Checklist of North American Birds published by the American Ornithologists Union there is a Hypothetical List consisting of twentyeight different birds which for various reasons have an un certain status in the bird fauna of the region for which the list is given Of these twenty eight birds I shall consider nine as from the evidence at hand it would appear that together they throw much light on some hitherto ob scure problems The list includes Coopers sandpiper Tringa cooperi Baird Brewsters linnet Acanthis brewsterii Ridgway Town sends bunting Spiza townsendii Audubon Lawrences warbler Helmirthophila lawrencii Herrick Brewsters warbler Helmintho phila leucobronchialis Brewster Carbonated warbler Dendroica carbonata Audubon Blue Mountain warbler Dendroica montana Wilson Smallheaded warbler Wilsonia microcephala Ridgway Cuviers kinglet Regulus cuvierii Audubon Of these nine kinds of birds seven either are represented by single individuals or are known only from figures and descriptions in the works of Audubon and Wilson On the other hand the two remaining birds of this series are known by numerous specimens and my reasons for including them will be pre sented as each is considered in detail It seems essential at this point to call atten tion to the fact that a number of these birds were discovered at a time when field natural ists were not nearly so numerous as at the present day and that there may be no doubt as to the reality of at least some of these forms a number of the types still exist as will presently be shown COOPERS SANDPIPER TRINGA COOPERI BAIRD Coopers sandpiper is known from a single individual that was taken on Long Island in May 1833 The type is still in the National Museum at Washington The evident rela tionship of this bird to the knot Tringa canutus Linnaeus is at once apparent to a student and even an untrained eye might readily distinguish their similarity For the SEPTEMBER 1 1905

the commissionerssection by section line by linein the most thorough manner Several changes were suggested and the proposed law will be further considered next year This matter occupied the greater part of the time at the conference One session was devoted to the consid eration of a National Corporation Law and an address on that subject was given by Professor H L Wilgus of the University of Michigan This with the report of the Committee on a Uniform Incorporation Law of which Mr W S Logan of New York was chairman brought about a lively discussion of the question whether the state boards of commissioners were authorized to recommend Federal legislation Action was finally taken permitting the committee to proceed in such way as might seem most proper to it Pro fessor H W Wiley of the Department of Agriculture gave a short address on the necessity for uniform pure food laws Dean Ames of Harvard has consented to draft a uniform Partnership Law to be considered at the next conference At the suggestion of the American Warehouse Association and through their liberality in providing funds for the purpose Professor Williston was engaged to draw a uniform law of Warehouse Receipts The conference has recommended uniform laws relative to the transfer of stock in corporations adopted in five states to the execution of wills to the probate of foreign wills to divorce procedure to

tenth annual convention at West Baden Springs Hotel West Baden Indiana July 2529 I904 The League has a membership of over 1200 and the convention was well attended The Annual Address was delivered by the President Professor F L Siddons of Washington D C addresses were delivered by Professor H L Wilgus of the University of Michigan Ann Arbor Mich upon the topic Should there be a Federal Incorporation Law for Commercial Corporations by the Hon orable 0 O Provosty Justice of the Supreme Court of Louisiana on The Testamentary Law of Louisiana and by the Honorable T Moultrie Mor decai of Charleston S C on The Bankruptcy Law in its Relation to Com merce Mr M D Wilber gave a short address on System Mr E H Chamber one on Free Reporting from a Victims Standpoint and Mr Geo H Napier on Office Methods One of the objects of the League is to promote uniformity of legisla tion and practice in matters affecting commercial law and after reviewing the work of the League in other directions President Siddons urged the League to undertake as of vital importance the work of promoting uniform commercial legislation he also spoke of three matters of great commercial importancethe acquisition of the Panama Canal property by the U S 53MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW Government the Northern Securities Decision and the enormous increase in the number of corporations In speaking of the last he reviewed most interestingly the history of incorpation under Sections 605 et seq of the Code of the District of Columbia of March 3 I902 providing for the formation of corporations in the Districtrecounting how it had been advertised as a National Corporation Law how Mr J P Morgans New York Dairy Com pany had abandoned their 30000000 Delaware charter already paid for and secured a 25000000 charter under the District Act and that Mr Rocke feller has been and is now following the leader and how within eighteen months ending June 30 I904 1427 companies with a capitalization of 2903 415900 had been organized under the act nearly all for the express purpose of doing business outside the District If these had been organized in New Jersey she would have received under her liberal laws nearly 600000 whereas the District got only I78375 for her charters and she gets no annual tax except upon tangible property within the District The paper of Professor Wilgus on Federal Incorporation elicited considerable discussion during which many members advocated a national corporation law and expressed the opinion that the Federal power under the commerce clause was broad enough to authorize its adoption Judge Provostys address was a most scholarly presentation of a technical subject made intensely interesting by bits of personal history that he skilfully wove into the stories of the cases he used for illustration The address of Mr Mordecai led to much discus sion showing that the working of a bankruptcy law throughout so extensive a territory as the United States is not always satisfactory and is much crippled by the nonuniformity of state exemption laws The proceedings of the League including the addresses together with the reports of various committees and the animated discussions that occurred are reported in The American Legal News for September THE PHILIPPINE ISLAND CASES IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESDuring the past summer an unusual number of cases of special interest have been decided in the United States Supreme Court They cover a wide range of questions and several of them are of more than ordinary sig nificance to the student of politics social institutions and national tendencies We shall give a very brief review of some of the more important of these decisions First in general interest comes a group of Philippine Island cases repre sented by Kepner v United States 24 Sup Ct Rep 797 and Dorr v United States 24 Sup Ct Rep 808 involving the questions of double jeopardy for the same offense and trial by jury The opinion of the court in each of these cases was written by MR JUSTICE DAY who as a member of the Span ish treaty commission and as Secretary of State during the important period when our government was confronted by early problems of Philippine legis lation is especially well qualified to discuss the intricate and novel situation there presented In Kepner v United States the plaintiff in error a practicing lawyer in 54

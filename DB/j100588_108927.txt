CONSIDERING THE CONDITIONS FOR THE EXISTENCE OF GIVEN SYSTEMS OF EQUALITIES BETWEEN THE ROOTS OF AN EQUATION WE OBTAIN SOME VERY INTERESTING EXAMPLES OF THE COMPOSITION OF RELATIONS A RELATION IS EITHER ONEFOLD EXPRESSED BY A SINGLE EQUATION U 0 OR IT IS SAY KFOLD EXPRESSED BY A SYSTEM OF K OR MORE EQUATIONS OF COURSE AS REGARDS ONEFOLD RELATIONS THE THEORY OF THE COMPOSITION IS WELL KNOWN THE RELATION UV 0 IS A RELATION COMPOUNDED OF THE RELATIONS UO V0 THAT IS IT IS A RELATION SATISFIED IF AND NOT SATISFIED UNLESS ONE OR THE OTHER OF THE TWO COMPONENT RELATIONS IS SATISFIED THE LIKE NOTION OF COMPOSITION APPLIES TO RELATIONS IN GENERAL VIZ THE COMPOUND RELATION IS A RELATION SATISFIED IF AND NOT SATISFIED UNLESS ONE OR THE OTHER OF THE TWO COMPONENT RELA TIONS IS SATISFIED I PURPOSELY REFRAIN AT PRESENT FROM ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE THEORY OF COMPOSITION I SAY THAT THE CONDITIONS FOR THE EXISTENCE OF GIVEN SYSTEMS OF EQUALITIES BETWEEN THE ROOTS OF AN EQUATION FURNISH INSTANCES OF SUCH COMPOSITION IN FACT IF WE EXPRESS THAT THE FUNCTION X YT AND ITS FIRSTDERIVED FUNCTION IN REGARD TO X OR WHAT IS THE SAME THING THAT THE FIRSTDERIVED FUNCTIONS IN REGARD TO X Y RESPECTIVELY HAVE A COMMON QUADRIC FACTOR WE OBTAIN BETWEEN THE COEFFICIENTS A CERTAIN TWOFOLD RELA TION WHICH IMPLIES EITHER THAT THE EQUATION XX Y0 HAS THREE EQUAL ROOTS OR ELSE THAT IT HAS TWO PAIRS OF EQUAL ROOTS THAT IS THE RELATION IN QUESTION IS SATISFIED IF AND IT IS NOT SATISFIED UNLESS THERE IS SATISFIED EITHER THE RELATION FOR THE EXISTENCE OF THREE EQUAL ROOTS OR ELSE THE RELATION FOR THE EXISTENCE OF TWO PAIRS OF EQUAL ROOTS OR THE RELATION FOR THE EXISTENCE OF THE QUADRIC FACTOR IS COMPOUNDED OF THE LASTMENTIONED TWO RELATIONS THE RELATION FOR THE QUADRIC FACTOR FOR ANY VALUE

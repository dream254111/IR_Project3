577  XXIII On the Conditions fJr the existence of Three Egjual Boots or of Two Pairs of Equal Boots of a Binary Quartic or Quintic By A CAYLEY FB8 Received November 26 1867Read January 9 1868 IN considering the conditions for the existence of given systems of equalities between the roots of an equation we obtain some very interesting examples of the composition of relations A relation is either onefold expressed by a single equation U 0 or it is say kfold expressed by a system of k or more equations Of course as regards onefold relations the theory of the composition is well known the relation UV 0 is a relation compounded of the relations UO V0 that is it is a relation satisfied if and not satisfied unless one or the other of the two component relations is satisfied The like notion of composition applies to relations in general viz the compound relation is a relation satisfied if and not satisfied unless one or the other of the two component rela tions is satisfied I purposely refrain at present from any further discussion of the theory of composition I say that the conditions for the existence of given systems of equalities between the roots of an equation furnish instances of such composition in fact if we express that the function x yT and its firstderived function in regard to x or what is the same thing that the firstderived functions in regard to x y respectively have a common quadric factor we obtain between the coefficients a certain twofold rela tion which implies either that the equation Xx y0 has three equal roots or else that it has two pairs of equal roots that is the relation in question is satisfied if and it is not satisfied unless there is satisfied either the relation for the existence of three equal roots or else the relation for the existence of two pairs of equal roots or the relation for the existence of the quadric factor is compounded of the lastmentioned two relations The relation for the quadric factor for any value whatever of n is at once seen to be expressible by means of an oblong matrix giving rise to a series of deter minants which are each to be put 0 the relation for three equal roots and that for two pairs of equal roots in the particular cases n 4 and n 5 are given in my  Memoir on the Conditions for the existence of given Systems of Equalities between the roots of an Equation Phil Trans vol cxlvii 1857 pp 727731 and I propose in the present Memoir to exhibit for the cases in question n 4 and n 5 the connexion between the compound relation for the quadric factor with the component relations for the three equal roots and for the two pairs of equal roots respectively Article Nos 1 to 8 the Quartic 1 For the quartic function a  c d e3X y4 4 X2578 PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON THE CONDITIONS FOR THE tXISTENCE the condition for three equal roots or say for a root system 31 is that the quadrinvariant and the cubinvariant each of them vanish viz we must have Iae4bd 3c 0 Jaceadb2e2bcdC30 2 The condition for two pairs of equal roots or for a root system 22 is that the cubicovariant vanishes identically viz representing this by A B 5C IGD 5E F Gyx y60 we must have A a2d3abc24 0 B a2e

determinants formed out of this matrix must therefore vanish for I J 0 and also for A B C D E F G 0 that is the determinants in question must be syzy getically related to the functions I J and also to the functions A B C D E F G 4 The values of the determinants are 12343x 12353x 1245 13453X 23453X  1 alce 1 ade 1 a2e2 1 abe  1 ace2  3 ad 4 abee 2 abde 4 acde 1 ade  1 abe 1 abd 9 acle 3 ad3  3 be 14

symmetry from the first seven I have only written down the seven Tables the solutions for the first and second Tables were obtained without difficulty but that for the third Table was so laborious to calculate and contains such extraordinarily high numbers that I did not proceed with the calculation and it is accordingly only the first second and third Tables which have at the foot of them respectively the solutions of the linear equations 16 The results given by these three Tables are of course 66ca 110b 1aCp6a12340O 330dZ110c355bC9aM105 a12350 266478575 e2 617359490 dB3 144200810 cl

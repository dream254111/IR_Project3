Opinions Race Discrimination January 1 1915 p 59 is surprising in Separate Coach only one way and that is the amount LawsObiter of dicta in the case For the opinion is filled with points absolutely unnecessary to the decision but which we think absolutely justified by the importance of the case The State of Oklahoma passed in 1907 what is known as a separate coach law It provided that every railway company    doing business in this State as a common carrier of passengers for hire should provide separate coaches or compartments for the accommodation of the white and negro races which separate coaches or cars should be equal in all points of comfort etc etc that separate waiting rooms with equal facilities etc should be furnished and defined negro to include every person of African descent as defined by the State Constitution It further provides that nothing con tained in the act should be construed to prevent railway com panies from hauling sleeping cars dining or chair cars attached to their trains to be used exclusively by either white or negro pas sengers separately but not jointly Penalties etc were pre scribed for failure to observe the law On February 15 1908 just before the time when the statute by its terms was to become effective five negro citizens of the State of Oklahoma four of whom are appellants here brought this suit in equity against the Atchison Topeka  Santa Fe Railway Company the St Louis  San Francisco Railroad Com pany the Missouri Kansas  Texas Railway Company the Chicago Rock Island  Pacific Railway Company and the Fort Smith  Western Railroad Company to restrain these companies from making any distinction in service on account of race On20 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER February 16 1908after the act had been in operation for a few daysan amended bill was filed seeking specifically to en join compliance with the provisions of the statute for the reason that it was repugnant a to the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution b to the Enabling Act under which the State of Oklahoma was admitted to the Union Act of June 16 1906 chap 3335  3 34 Stat at L 267 269 and c to the 14th Amendment The railroad companies severally demurred to the amended bill asserting that it failed to state a case entitling the complainants to relief in equity The Circuit Court sustained the demurrers and as the complainants elected to stand upon their bill final decree dismissing the bill was entered This de cree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals 109 C C A 110 186 Fed 966 and the present appeal has been brought The conclusions of the court below as stated in its opinion were in substance 1 That under the Enabling Act the State of Oklahoma was admitted to the Union on an equal footing with the original States and with respect to the matter in question had authority to enact such laws not in conflict with the Federal Constitution as other States could enact citing Permoli v New Orleans 3 How 589 609 11 L Ed 739 748 Escanaba  L

of the other 4 That in determining the validity of the statute the doctrine that an act although fair on its face might be so unequally and oppressively administered by the public authorities as to amount to an unconstitutional discrimination by the State itself Yick Wo v Hopkins 118 U S 356 373 30 L Ed 220 227 6 Sup Ct Rep 1064 was not applicable as there was no basis in the present case for holding that any discriminations by carriers which were unauthorized by the statute were practiced under State authority 5 That the act in the absence of a different construction by the State court

667 20 Ann Cas 980 6 That with respect to the existence of discriminations the allegations of the bill were too vague and uncertain to entitle the complainants to a decree The Supreme CourtMr Justice Hughes delivering the opin ion the Chief Justice Holmes Lamar and Reynolds JJ con curring only in the resultupheld the lower courts decision upon every one of these conclusions except the third which in the opinion is held not to be sound because it makes the constitu tional right of the negro depend upon the number of persons who may be discriminated against whereas the essence of the con stitutional right is that it is a personal one and if the individual is denied by a common carrier acting under the authority of a State law a facility or convenience in the course of his journey which under substantially the same circumstances is furnished to another traveler he may properly complain that his constitu tional privilege has been invaded The peculiar feature of this case is that not a single one of 1915  783 EDITORIAL20 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER these conclusions was necessary to the decision of the case The learned Justice held that the bill had to be dismissed and the re lief prayed for denied because the suit was brought before the law went into effect and the amended bill filed very shortly there after and that there was no injury established as to complainants None of the complainants alleged that they had ever traveled on any of the roads complained of or even requested transportation or been refused accommodation in sleeper or diner or anywhere else Under the most elementary principles the complainants had no standing in court it not appearing that they had any need of relief or did not have an adequate remedy at law The bill was therefore dismissed upon this ground and whilst we are very glad to see the principles set out in the opinion approved by a majority of the court yet we are by no manner of means satis fied that this case is authority for a single principle laid down in it except the one that there was no equity in a bill filed under the circumstances For many years since in Carroll v Carrolls Lessee 57 U S 16 Howard 275 the Supreme Court of the United States said If the construction put by the court of a State upon one of its statutes was not a matter of judgment if it might have been decided either way without affecting any right brought into question then according to the principles ot colTm mon law an opinion upon such a question is not a decision To make it so there must have been an application of the judicial mind to the precise question necessary to be determined to fix the rights of the parties and decide to whom the property in con testation belongs And therefore this court as other courts or ganized under the common law has never held itself bound by any part of an opinion in any case which was not needful to the ascertainment of the right or title in question between the par ties We can very well see why the Chief Justice and Holmes Lamar and Reynolds JJ concurred only in the result At the same time in our judgment the opinion of Mr Justice Hughes upon all the conclusions of the lower court except the third merely reiterated and affirmed principles well settled by previous decisions of the court and his opinion in the third conclusion is clearly good law even if it was not necessary to the decision of the case We have always believed and reiterate our belief that 784  FebEDITORIAL when a constitutional question is fairly and squarely presented to a court of last resort it ought to be settled no matter upon what other grounds the case was affirmed or reversed See our editorial 20 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER 71 After long and tedious litigation the United Hatters of North America and the American Federation of Labor have learned the lesson which the Hatter impressed upon Knocked into a Alice Its very easy to make more than Cocked Hat nothing They have also learned that its a poor rule which doesnt work both ways and that tyrannical labor is no more above the law than tyranni cal capital The Supreme Court of the United States on the 5th of January handed down a final decision in the celebrated Dan bury Hatters case as it is generally called and the court is very severe in its strictures upon the practices and bylaws of the association first mentioned It sustained the verdict of the lower court that the defendant members of the Union were guilty of conspiracy in restraint of trade and liable for the heavy damages imposed in the lower forum Justice Holmes who handed down the courts decision said in part The substance of the charge is that the plaintiffs were hat manufacturers who employed nonunion labor that the defend ants were members of the United Hatters of North America and also the American Federation of Labor that in pursuance of a general scheme to unionize the labor employed by manufac turers of fur hats a purpose previously made effective against all but a few manufacturers the defendants and other members of the United Hatters caused the American Federation of Labor to declare a boycott against the plaintiffs and against all hats sold by the plaintiffs to dealers who should deal in them and that they carried out their plan with such success that they have re strained or destroyed the plaintiffs commerce with other States W5e agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals Justice Holmes ccntinues that a combination and conspiracy forbidden by the statute were proved and that the question is now narrowed to 5 1915  78520 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER the responsibility of the defendants for what was done by tne sanction and procurement of the societies above named It is a tax upon credulity to ask any one to believe that mem bers of labor unions of that kind did not know that the primary and secondary boycott and the use of we dont patronize or the unfair list were expected to be employed in the effort to unionize these shops The jury could not but find that by the usage of the unions the acts complained of were authorized and authorized without regard to their interference with commerce among the States Referring to the propriety of the evidence submitted in the lower court Justice Holmes said The introduction of newspapers etc was proper in large part to show publicity in places and directions where the facts were likely to be brought home to the defendants and also to prove an intended and detrimental consequence of the principal acts not to speak of other grounds It was in 1912 after a ten weeks trial that a jury found guilty the living defendants named in the suit against the Hatters Un ion thirtyfour having diedand rendered a verdict of 80000 as originally claimed which trebled made with the costs 252000 Appeal was again had to the Circuit Court of Ap peals That court affirmed the judgment From this decision the defendants appealed to the Supreme Court Most of the defendants it is said live near Danbury The illegal nature of the acts complained of had been settled in the case of the Retail Lumber Dealers Association zr United States but the decision in the present case fixes the personal lia bility of members of the offending unions and is salutary to the highest degree in that it establishes the fact that the same rule appliesas it ought to applyto those who supply capital and those who supply labor as to the illegal acts of each There has been some discussion as to the permanent value of this decision in the light ofthe Clayton AntiTrust Act passed by the Congress at its last session But that act in our judgment does not give the unions any new rights and certainly does not excuse members of any union from responsibility for the acts of those unions to which they gave their consent Nor should they be excused for once establish the fact that any man or 786  Febset of men are above the law or are separated from the rest of their fellows by reason of their position or occupation as to the effect of their illegal acts then a tyranny of the worst sort is established and life liberty and property are at the mercy of un restrained and lawless men The AntiAlien Employment Act which was adopted by the people of the State of Arizona upon an initiative has been held to be null and void by the Federal Court of The Initiation of that State and even the police power an Initiative failed to save it This was an act prohibiting an employer from employing more than twenty per cent of alien laborers An injunction was asked and granted against the enforcement of this act and the court now makes that injunction permanent The Supreme Court of the United States has recently held that the right to labor is a right of property The wisdom and correctness of this ruling cannot be called in question The Constitution of the United States provides that no State can deprive an individual of the right to property Whether this inhibition extended to the property of aliens has not always been free of doubt but the court in the present case expressly decides that it does In declaring the act null and void The law was intended the courts opinion says to be a police regulation but under guise of police regulation the State was in effect depriving the complainant of his right to la bor guaranteed to him by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution If under guise of police regulation a State can prohibit an em ployer from employing more than 20 per cent of alien labor it can prohibit him from employing more than 5 per cent and if 5 per cent any at all This decision may have and ought to have a far wider effect than is to be seen at first glance Not only does it establish the fact that the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States protects aliens as well as citizens but it opens a rather interesting question as to the future attitude of the courts upon the relations between union and nonunion labor and the 1915  787 EDITORIAL20 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER protection of labor from the assaults it so often has to endure at the hands of its friends The rights of aliens as against discriminatory laws passed by the States in violation of treaties between the United States and foreign nations may be widely extended by following the rea soning of this opinion That the decision is right few think ing men will question Its effect whether for good or evil can not be considered in the light of that fact Every decision upon this Act is of importance in view of the fact that there are yet many undetermined questions arising un der the statute In the case of Gar The Federal Employers rett v L  N R R Co U S S Liability Act C Advance Sheets January 1 1914 p 32 Mr Justice Reynolds speaking for the court declares it to be now definitely settled that the Act declares two distinct and independent liabilities resting upon the common foundation of a wrongful injury 1 Lia bility to the injured employee for which he alone can recover and 2 in case of death liability to his personal representatives for the benefit of the surviving widow or husband and children and if none then of the parents which extends ONLY to the pecuniary loss and damage resulting to them by reason of the death This case also settles the point that the right of action created by the Act in behalf of an injured railway employee is extinguished by his death as the result of such injury Nearly every State in the Union has remedied this last un just provision of similar statutes The Tnited States should do so as well The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has decided that a bond is a promissory note At least that is the effect of T D No 2110 which to the average Vir The Stamp Tax Again ginia lawyer reading the decision would Bonds and Deeds make him imagine that he was suffer ing a slight attack of D T No 1 The opinion is as follows 788  FebEDITORIAL In order to make plain the meaning of said Treasury Decision it may be stated that taxable bonds under the Revenue Act of October 22 1914 are divided into two distinct classes having neither in form purpose nor law any resemblance whatever to each other They are First Bonds issued as certificates or evidence of in debtedness generally based upon mortgages or some other character of security founded upon real or personal property Second Bonds of indemnity for loss to secure the per formance of the duties of any office or position or for the doing of any other thing therein specified The first class is taxed under the law at five cents on each one hundred dollars of face value or fraction thereof when issued by any association company or corporation If however they are issued simply by an individual and based either upon his individual credit or property and obligating him to pay a certain sum or sums of money at a specified time or times with or without coupons simply marking and indicating interest due thereon and whether or not based upon a mortgage of either personal or real property they fall within the taxation imposed upon promissory notes that is to say two cents when promising to pay a sum not exceeding one hundred dollars and two cents for each additional one hundred dollars or fractional part thereof The second class bonds or obligations of the nature of indemnity for loss security or guaranteeing official obliga tions are accompanied usually by sureties either personal or corporate When such bonds are executed only by per sons without charge therefor in the nature of premium they fall under the subdivision of class two which the law desig nates as bonds of any description    not otherwise provided for in this schedtvle fifty cents Such personal indemnity bonds therefore without premium are the only character of bonds within the revenue act subject to a fifty cent tax Indemnity bonds issued by any person associa tion or corporation transacting the business of indemnity insurance are taxable in all cases and for all purposes at the rate of onehalf of one cent on each dollar or fractional part thereof upon the total amount of premium charged The first class of bonds are almost uniformly based upon mortgages of either personal property or real property whereas the second class would rarely be issued in connec tion with a mortgage or other property used as security or collateral for the payment of a debt The nature and pur pose of the two bonds would fix their status for taxation and not the extraneous facts as to whether thev were issued 1915  78920 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER with or without mortgages Any inconsistent ruling here tofore made is modified in line with the foregoing In addition to this ruling we give the opinion of the Commis sioner in full in regard to the tax on deeds etc which seems to be founded on right reason though it is hard to reconcile the first clause of the decision with the exact terms of the Act The act provides that a deed instrument or writing whereby any lands tenements or other realty sold shall be granted assigned transferred or otherwise conveyed when the con sideration or value of the interest or property conveyed exclusive of the value of any lien or inctmbrance thereon exceeds 100 and does not exceed 500 shall be subject to a tax of 50 cents and for each additional 500 or fractional part thereof in excess of 500 50 cents For instance where a property is sold for 2000 1000 of which is received in cash and a promissory note for the balance the tax to be imposed upon the deed should be com puted on the basis of the cash received and the said prom issory note becomes subject to the tax imposed upon such in strunments that is 1 on the deed and 20 cents on the note In the case of a deed which states that the transfer is made for a nominal consideration or a consideration of 1 the tax must be computed upon the actual value of the inter est or property conveyed the amount of any lien or incum brance being deducted and the person who executes the deed is required to affix stamps thereto and becomes liable to penalty if stamps in a sufficient amount based upon the ac tual value of the consideration given are not so affixed A deed which is executed dated and delivered prior to Dec 1 1914 is nof subject to tax under the provisions of the said act and therefore may be accepted for record sub sequent to that date without having documentary stamps af fixed thereto A deed which was dated prior to Dec 1 1914 but was acknowledged before a notary public and delivered subse quently to that date is taxable Section 13 of the said act provides that it shall not be lawful to record or register any instrument paper or docu nient required by law to be stamped unless stamp or stamps of the proper amount shall have been affixed and canceled in the manner prescribed by law Where a deed is presented to a recording officer and it appears probable that an insufficient amount of internal rev enue stamps are attached thereto and he is not satisfied with 790  Febthe explanation furnished by the party offering the same for record he should notify the Collector of Revenue It is not expected that the recording officer will institute an in vestigation to see whether there has been any violation of the law nor is it thought that he should exact an affidavit showing the true consideration A contract for the sale of real estate which provides for the issuance of a deed at some future date upon the fulfill ment of certain conditions is not subject to tax if executed by the owner of the land If executed by a broker it is subject to a tax of 10 cents A partition deed which is operative in defining boundary lines or in showing by location each tenantincommons in terest is not subjected to tax A quit claim deed given for no consideration or merely the nominal consideration of 1 for the purpose of correct ing a flaw in title is not subject to tax No tax is imposed upon an option for the purchase of real property Oil leaves leases of mining property long term mining leases c which in themselves convey no title to or in terest in real property are exempt from tax Deeds in escrow do not become subject to the said tax until the final delivery is made Therefore if delivery of such a deed is made subsequent to December 1 1914 it becomes subject to the tax imposed upon conveyances Deeds of release and deeds of trust are exempt from tax under the provisions of the said act Deeds issued by Masters in Chancery Sheriffs c to cover transfer of property sold under a foreclosure or exe cution are subject to tax the cost of which may be added to the court costs Deeds to burial sites which do not convey title to land but only a right to sepulchre to erect monuments c are exempt from tax A deed issued to cover a gift of property from husband to wife or from parent to child or from an individual to a municipality or other political subdivision wherein the con sideration named is natural love and affection and 1 de sire to promote public welfare and 1 or 1 and other valuable considerations is not taxable In the case of an exchange of fwo properties the deeds transferring title to each are subject to tax which should in each case be computed on the basis of the actual value of the interest or property conveyed the amount of any lien or incumbrance being deducted A deed executed by a debtor covering an assignment of property to a trustee to be held for the benefit of a creditor 1915  791 EDITORIAL20 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER is not subject to tax When however the trustee sells or conveys such property either to the creditor or any other person the deeds executed by him are taxable A deed transferring title to property to a building and loan association for the purpose of securing a loan on the property so conveyed which property is immediately recon veyed to its owner is not subject to tax the deed of recon veyance being likewise exempt A deed given by a husband and wife to a straw man who immediately executes a deed reconveying the property to the wife is not subject to tax if given for no valuable consideration or merely the nominal consideration of 1 and likewise the deed of reconveyance is exempt Of course these decisions of Commissioner Osborne are not finalities Any one of them can be testel in the court but the amount involved is usually so small it is hard to find a suitor willing to undertake the task We would like very much to see the decision of the court upon those clauses in the Act which specifically say Bonds of any description not otherwise provided for in this schedule and when previously promissory notes except bank notes and renewals of same are taxed 2 cents per 100 If the Congress intended to use legal phraseologyand it is presumed it didit must have intended a bond to mean a bond and a note a note But the Commissioner doesnt think so and his opinion goes until reversed by some court And talking of sprightly neighbors we notice that the Green

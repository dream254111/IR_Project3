des gaz sous des pressions plus grandes que la pression de latmosphrre Ce travail a pour but de decider si la chaleur specifique dune meme masse de gaz reste con stante sous les diff6rentes densit6s que lon peut donner a ce gaz et de trouver la loi de la variation 10 Sur les chaleurs degagees ou absorbees par lair pendant sa compression ou son expansion Ce travail est celui qui ma le plus longtemps arrete et qui ma empech6 de publier lensemble de mes recherches Cest i cette occasion que jai etudie les phenomenes calorifiques qui se produisent pendant le passage des gaz comprimes a travers de petites ouvertures ou par des tubes capillaires suivant que le gaz est chaud on quil est frbid Jai etudie le meine sujet sur le gaz qui produit un travail raoteur 1 Completenent interieur an calorimetre 2 Exterieur au calorimletre et produisant un effet mecanique qui puisse etre assigne Je suis encore arrete dans les conclusions a deduire de ce dernier travail par suite de plusieurs anomalies dont je ne trouve lexplica tion par aucune des theories proposees 11 Sur les chaleurs sp6cifiques des vapeurs sous diverses pres sions Jai soumis a ces recherches un tres grand nombre de vapeurs mais en insistant plus specialement sur celles qui peuvent etre ob tenues a letat de purete parfaite et helas elles ne sont pas tres nombreuses La chaleur specifique que jai trouave a la vapeur deau sous la pression de latmosphere est 0475 par rapport a leau liquide Lensemble de ces recherches permettra de calculer numeriquement les effets mecaniques que lon peut retirer theoriquement de 1 kil de charbon suivant que lon applique la chaleur a la production de la vapeur deau ou dune autre vapeur sous diverses pressions a saturation ou sous detente ou quon lapplique a un gaz quelconque a detente ou sous pression constante En un mot jespere que les resultats obtenus dans ces recherches permettront de resoudre enfin avec quelque certitude les questions qui divisent depuis si longtemps les ingenieurs en menme temps quelle fourniront un grand nombre depreuves pour decider les diverses theories qui oat ete proposees pour la chaleur Je vous prie mon cher Colonel de donner lecture de cette lettre k la Societe Royale et den demander linsertion dans ses publica tions si elle ny trouve pas dempechement Jai lhonneur detre Votre devoue serviteur V REGNAULT 2 Extract from a letter from M Kamtz addressed to Colonel Sabine Translation Received April 10 1853 Dorpat 15th March N Style 1853 I have just completed the memoir on terrestrial magnetism which I mentioned to you in former letters It would follow from the ma terials which I have employed that the horizontal force requires constants which differ from those for the vertical force and the301 differences although for the most part not considerable are some times too large as it appears to me to be overlooked it is for observers to decide in this matter To avoid the introduction of insecure numbers I have not computed the potential but lave con tented myself with deriving the values of X Y and Z declination inclination and force horizontal and total being the quantities principally used for comparison A second calculation of the con stants for X and Y would have given rather more exact values but I think that with the existing data the result would scarcely repay the labour of so extensive a calculation for the tables would have to be entirely recomputed After obtaining the data from the theory I wished to compare them with observation I could take for the inclination and force the values which had served as the bases of the calculation there are indeed several observations of inclination without our knowing the force and a few of the force without inclination but on the other hand there are more extensive districts where I had no declina tions although the other two elements were well determined Under these circumstances I was obliged to have recourse to older observa tions which indeed I had occasion to use also for secular change and reduction for epoch to 1830 Thus the character of the work was gradually modified For the Atlantic Ocean I availed myself of your excellent Memoir Contributions No IX I only added the obser vations of Liitke dUrville and Rumker of older observations I took those of Abercrombie and Ekeberg only using them however in parts where they had observed the inclination and principally with the view of finding its secular change In the Pacific there was more deficiency with the exception of what has been furnished by Litke dUrville the ships of the Prus sian Merchant Service and in the neighbourhood of the magnetic equator by Duperrey modern voyages scarcely gave me anything for Becquerel in his detailed table omits all determinations made at sea I therefore took all I could get since the voyages of Byron Carteret and Wallis chiefly from lHansteens great work and reduced to 1830 taking from each observer the mean of all his determina tions within a space of 5 lat and 10 long I did not allow myself to exclude any observer for as all have errors from the ships iron it might easily happen that a man but little known may have given values which are much nearer to the truth than those given by a celebrated voyager A selection is no less objectionablej as it might easily lead to retaining observations which accord with a possibly not altogether correct theory and omitting others other wise good which might depart from it Moreover such a full com parison shows better what may be expected from the observations incomplete as are the data they afford yet when I arrange the re maining errors in latitude and longitude I rarely find groups in which the errors show a certain degree of systematic character over ex tensive districts so as to alter the declination or inclination a degree  Electricite tome vii PROCEEDINGS OF TIIE POYAL SOCIETY VOL VI No 96 21302 The inclination appears to me to be very incorrect

declination 413 I haye gained my principal object in the work by becoming my self better informed but I have thought it might perhaps not be wholly useless to others if only to stimulate travellers to make ob servations for comparison and I have therefore been at tlie pains of writing out the table of comparisons a task more irksome than that of calculation But to publish is very difficult on such a subject and under present political circumstances no bookseller in Germany would undertake it The Admiralty at St Petersburgh would per haps print it in their Memoirs but in the Russian language in which it would be as good as buried I turn to you asking whether it might not be possible to get it published in England not as a separate work for perhaps no bookseller would accept it but in a collection of similar papers To me it would be most agreeable if it could appear either in the Reports of the British Association or in the Philosophical Transactions and by preference in the latter because I have derived from thence the best part of my materials besides which the first re sults ihave already appeared in the Proceedings of the Royal Society Youwill be best able to judge for me I do not know what is the prae tice of either of those bodies in regard to writings not by their own members My memoir is I fear long but yet it consists chiefly of the table of comparisons Of maps I give declination inclination and total force two of each Mercator and Polar Unluckily I have no translator here who understands the subject 3o I could only uiake the attempt myself and as the memnoir consists chiefly of figures from whence simple deductions are derived there cannot be great errors iin the rest pray make the needful alterationis where there are glaring Germanisms if you think it possible the whole may be printed If not pray send me back the MSS at some future time not for publication but for my own use I finished yesterday and send this week to the British Embassy only I

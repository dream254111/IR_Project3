J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107553,ON THE MODE OF FORMATION OF THE CANAL FOR CONTAINING THE SPINAL MARROW AND ON THE FORM OF THE FINS IF THEY DESERVE THAT NAME OF THE PROTEOSAURUS,I206975,EC 59 3 XI ON THE MODE OF FORMATION OF THE CANAL FOR CONTAINING THE SPINAL MARROW AND ON THEFORM OF THE FINS IF THEY DESERVE THAT NAME OF THE PROTEOSAURUS BY SIR EVERARD HOME BART VVP R S READ MAY 4TH 1820 THE LAST COMMUNICATION RESPECTING THE BONES OF THE PROTEO SAURUS WHICH I LAID BEFORE THE ROYAL SOCIETY CONTAINED SO MANY IMPORTANT FACTS CONNECTED WITH THE SKELETON THAT THERE WAS NO ROOM LEFT TO HOPE I SHOULD EVER AGAIN CALL THE ATTEN TION OF ITS MEMBERS TO THIS SUBJECT YET SUCH HAS BEEN THE EXERTION MADE BY SOME PERSONS EMPLOYED BY COLONEL BIRCH TO EXPLORE THE CLIFFS AT LYME IN SEARCH OF FOSSIL ORGANIC REMAINS FROM AN EXPECTATION THAT THEY WILL RECEIVE THE FULL REWARD OF THEIR LABOURS THAT MANY NEW SPECIMENS HAVE BEEN LATELY COLLECTED IN ONE OF THESE WHICH COLONEL BIRCH HAS SUBMITTED TO MY OBSERVATION SEVERAL BONES ARE MET WITH THAT HAVE NOT BEEN DESCRIBED AND WHICH GIVE A VERY IMPORTANT CHARACTER TO THE VERTEBRAE AND ALSO FORM A MORE COMPLETE SET OF THE BONES OF THE FIN OF THESE I SHALL GIVE A DESCRIPTION WHERE THEIR APPEARANCE IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY ILLUSTRATED BY THE ANNEXED PLATE P1 XV ALTHOUGH THE BODIES OF THE VERTEBRAE OF THIS ANIMAL HAVE BEEN MORE FREQUENTLY MET WITH THAN ANY OTHER BONES THE MANNER IN WHICH THE CANAL FOR THE SPINAL MARROW IS FORMED HAS NOT TILL NOW BEEN MADE OUT IN THIS SPECIMEN WE FIND16O SIR EVERARD HOME ON THE CANAL FOR CONTAINING IN WHAT MANNER THAT IS DONE AND IN THIS AS WELL AS IN MANY OTHER PARTICULARS THE SKELETON DIFFERS FROM THAT OF OTHER ANIMALS IN ALL THE LIZARD TRIBE THE VERTEBRAE LIKE THOSE OF OTHER QUADRUPEDS CONSIST OF A BODY TWO TRANSVERSE AND ONE SPI NOUS PROCESS SURROUNDING A CENTRAL HOLE WHICH FORMS THE SPINAL CANAL THE VERTEBRAE OF THE DIFFERENT TRIBES OF PROTEUS HAVE THE SAME STRUCTURE AS IS SHOWN IN A PLATE ANNEXED TO MY FORMER PAPER UPON THAT SUBJECT IN CARTILAGINOUS FISHES THE MECHANISM IS VERY DIFFERENT THE BODIES OF THE VERTEBRAE PROPERLY SPEAKING FORM THE SPINAL COLUMN AND THE CANAL FOR THE SPINAL MARROW IS SURROUNDED BY SEPARATE CARTILAGES UNITED TO THE VERTEBRAE BY PROJECTIONS FITTED TO CORRESPONDING NOTCHES IN THE SIDE OF EACH VERTEBRA THROUGH THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE TAIL A SIMILAR CANAL IS FORMED UPON THE UNDER EDGE OF THE VERTEBRAE IN WHICH ARE CONTAINED AND DEFENDED FROM INJURY THE GREAT ARTERY AND VEIN IN THE FOSSIL REMAINS OF THE SHARK TRIBE THE BODIES OF THESE VERTEBRAE ARE VERY FRE QUENTLY MET WITH AND HAVE HITHERTO BEEN READILY DISTIN GUISHED FROM ALL OTHERS BY THESE PECULIARITIES THE STRUCTURE OF THE VERTEBRAE OF THE PROTEOSAURUS IS SOME THING INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN THE TWO KINDS WHICH I LIAVE DE SCRIBED IT IS COMPOSED OF BONE AS IN THE LIZARD TRIBE BUT CONSISTS OF A BODY ONLY BEHIND WHICH IS A CANAL FOR THE SPINAL MARROW AND THE SPINOUS PROCESS WITH TWO LATERAL BRANCHES WHICH BELONG TO IT QUITE DISTINCT FROM THE BODY OF THE VER TEBRA AND BETWEEN THESE THERE IS NO BONY UNION BUT A SPECIES OF JOINT PECULIAR TO THEMSELVES THE CANAL THUS FORMED DE FENDS THE SPINAL MARROW FROM INJURY EQUALLY AS WHEN THE WHOLE VERTEBRA IS IN ONE PIECE IT IS UNUSUALLY SMALL THETHE SPINAL MARROW C OF THE PROTEOSAURUS 6 BODIES OF THESE VERTEBRA WHEN MET WITH WITHOUT THE SPINOUS PROCESSES HAVE SO CLOSE A RESEMBLANCE TO THE VERTEBRAE OF THE SHARK IN A FOSSIL STATE THAT THEY HAVE TILL NOW BEEN MIS TAKEN FOR THEM AND I FOUND SEVERAL OF THEM PRESERVED IN THE HUNTERIAN COLLECTION MARKED AS BELONGING TO THAT FISH THE PARTICULAR STRUCTURE WHICH I HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO DESCRIBE WILL BE MORE READILY UNDERSTOOD BY A REFERENCE TO THE ANNEXED PLATE PI XV IN WHICH IT IS VERY ACCURATELY REPRESENTED IN THE SAME FIGURE IN WHICH THE MANNER OF SETTING ON THE SPINOUS PROCESS TO THE VERTEBRA IS SHOWN THERE IS WHAT I HAVE NEVER BEFORE MET WITH ONE OF THE FEET PADDLES OR FINS FOR IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY WHICH OF THESE NAMES IS THE MOST PROPERIN WHICH THE BONES ARE NEARLY COMPLETE FOR ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE SMALLEST ARE WANTING THERE ARE QUITE ENOUGH TO GIVE A TOLERABLY EXACT FIGURE OF THE OUTLINE OF THIS NO OTHER SPECIMEN HAS AFFORDED THE MOST DISTANT IDEA THIS OUTLINE CERTAINLY HAS MORE RESEMBLANCE TO THAT OF A FIN THAN TO ANY OF THE FORE FEET OF THE TRIBE OF LACERTA OR THE SEAL OR EVEN THE TURTLE AND WHAT IS THE MOST REMARKABLE CIRCUMSTANCE THERE IS NOTHING IN ANY WAY CORRESPONDENT TO THE THUMB OR CLAW FOR LAYING HOLD WHICH DISTINGUISHES THE ANIMALS THAT OCCA SIONALLY INHABIT THE SEA AND COME ASHORE FOR THE PURPOSE OF LAYING THEIR EGGS OR DEPOSITING THEIR YOUNG IT CERTAINLY HAS THE APPEARANCE OF A FIN BUT IF IN FUTURE IT IS TO BE DE SIGNATED UNDER THAT NAME IT IS ALWAYS TO BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS FIN CONTRARY TO EVERY THING HITHERTO KNOWN IN NATURE IS MADE UP OF BONY MATERIALS  AND IT IS FROM THE GREAT NUMBER OF BONES OF WHICH IT IS COMPOSED AND THE CORRESPONDENT162 SIR EVERARD HOIME ON THE CANALFOR CONTAINING NUMBER OF JOINTS BY WHICH THESE BONES ARE UNITED TO EACH OTHER THAT IT IS ENABLED TO PERFORM THE OFFICE OF ANY THING RESEMBLING THE FIN OF A FISH IN THE WHALE TRIBE THEY ARE NOT PROPERLY FINS ALTHOUGH THEY CANNOT DESERVE ANY OTHER NAME AS THEY CONTAIN THE SAME SERIES OF BONES AS IN THE SEAL AND YET NO REASON CAN BE GIVEN WYHY THAT IS THE CASE IN THE PROTEOSAURUS WHICH PARTAKES MORE OF THE FISH THAN OF THE WHALE TRIBE THERE IS PROBABLY A GREATER DEGREE OF NICETY OF ADJUSTMENT OF MOTION WANTED THAN IN THE WHALE AND CONSEQUENTLY A GREATER SUBDIVISION OF PARTS TO COMPENSATE FOR THE UNYIELDING MATERIALS OF WHICH THESE PARTS ARE COMPOSED AND IN THIS INSTANCE THERE ARE MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED BONES VWHICH MUST GREATLY EXCEED THE NUMBER OF CARTILAGES MET WITH IN THE FINS OF THE SHARK THE FACTS SHOWN IN THIS SPECIMEN IT WILL BE ADMITTED ARE OF CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE IN MAKING US MORE INTIMATELY AC QUAINTED WITH THE SKELETON OF THIS MOST EXTRAORDINARY ANIMAL THE SECOND FIGURE CONTAINED IN THE SAME PLATE PI XV IS OF A LESS INTERESTING NATURE BECAUSE THE PARTS HAVE BEEN REPEATEDLY SHOWN UPON FORMER OCCASIONS  AND ALTHOUGH THERE IS SUFFI CIENT RESEMBLANCE OF PARTS TO GIVE THE IDEA OF THIS FIGURE BELONGING TO THE SAME SKULL AS THE OTHER ON WHICH THE FACTS THAT HAVE BEEN DETAILED HAVE THEIR DEPENDANCE IF THAT IS ADMITTED MUCH INTERVENING SUBSTANCE MUST HAVE BEEN LOST IN THIS FIGURE THE TEETH ARE BETTER SEEN THAN IN ANY OTHER THAT I HAVE EXAMINED THEY ARE DISTINCTLY GROOVED ON THEIR SURFACE UP TO THEIR POINTS AND ARE FIRMLY FIXED IN THE JAW SO THAT THEY ARE ALL PRESERVED IN THEIR PROPER PLACE THE SECTION OF THE NOSE REPRESENTED IN P1 XVI SHOWS THAT THE NOSTRILS ARE CONTINUED ON TO THE POINT OF THE NOSE ANDTHE SPINAL MARROW C OF THE PROTEOSAURUS THE SECTION OF THE TEETH DETERMINE THEIR MODE OF GROWTH TO BE THE SAME AS IN THE CROCODILE AT THE CLOSE OF THIS PAPER I HAVE MUCH SATISFACTION IN STATING THAT THE BONES OF THE PELVIS THE ONLY ONES NOT YET DESCRIBED HAVE AT LAST BEEN BROUGHT UNDER MY OBSERVATION IN A SPECIMEN FOUND AT WATCHET IN SOMERSETSHIRE AND LATELY PURCHASED FOR THE MUSEUM OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS IN LONDON THE SPECIMEN IS FOUR FEET SIX INCHES IN LENGTH AND IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE BONES HAVING BEEN LITTLE DISTURBED IS IN ALL RESPECTS MORE COMPLETE THAN ANY OTHER SPECIMEN THAT HAS BEEN MET WITH THE BONES OF THE PELVIS ARE HOWEVER IN THIS SPECIMEN TOO MUCH PRESSED UPON ONE ANOTHER TO ADMIT OF A SATISFACTORY DRAWING BEING MADE CF THEM BUT THEY RESEMBLE SO CLOSELY THOSE OF THE CROCODILE AS TO MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION UNNECESSARY ALL THE FOSSIL BONES OF THE PROTEOSAURUS WHICH I HAVE DE SCRIBED BELONG TO THE SAME SPECIES BUT I HAVE SEEN BONES OF ANOTHER SPECIES WHICH DIFFERS FROM THIS IN THE FOLLOWING PARTICULARSTHE UPPER JAW IS MUCH LONGER NARROWER AND COMES MORE TO A POINT THE TEETH WERE SO LOOSELY FIXED IN THE JAWS THAT HARDLY ANY ARE MET WITH IN THEIR SOCKETS THAT PART WHICH HAD BEEN ENCLOSED BY THE GUM WAS GROOVED  THE OTHER PORTION IS VERY SLENDER HAS A POLISHED SURFACE AND COMES TO A SHARP POINT THE LONG BONE BELONGING TO THE ANTERIOR FIN IN BOTH SPE CIES IS AS LARGE AGAIN AS THAT BELONGING TO THE POSTERIOR BUT BOTH THESE BONES ARE FLATTER AND LONGER IN THE NEW SPECIES AND WHERE ARTICULATED WITH THE TWO SMALL BONES OF THE FIN SEND A SHORT PROCESS BETWEEN THEM THERE IS ALSO A DEEP NOTCH ON THE OUTER OR LOWER SIDE OF ONE OF THESE TWO SMALL BONES 163164 SIR EVERARD HOME ON THE CANALFOR CONTAINING C EXPLANATION OF THE

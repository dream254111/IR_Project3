cursory visits of the United States government expeditions in the Bibb 1869 Btake 18tTt8 and Al botross 188586 as well as to the explorations of Louis Agassiz 18505l and Alexander Agassiz 1881 Certain assistants of Alexander Agassiz have also studied the fauna of the Tortugas and several expeditions not under government control have visited the reefs notably that o the University of Iowa under a a Nutting in 1893 The latest expedition to the islands was that of the Museum of the Brooklyn In stitute of Arts and Sciences in 1902 the re sults of which have not yet been published Since 1898 the United States government has established a naval coaling station upon the Tortugas and frequent and regular com munication with Key West is now maintained by Ineans of a large oceangoing tug The region has thus recently becoine accessible and the tiine for the establishment of a research station upon the islands is now ripe The Tortugas group is composed of seven low sandy islands and numerous reef flats irregularly disposed so as to partially enclose a lagoon about ten miles long and six miles wide and having an average depth of about eight fathoins Two of the islands are inhabited Garden Key being occupied by Fort Jefferson and Loggerhead Key by the Tortugas Lighthouse The group is the Inost recent of the Florida reefs Pure deep ocean water surrounds them and there are none of the extensive mud llats or mangrovecovered shores so characteristic of the keys along the mainland coast of Florida The northern edge of the Gulf Stream lies about twentyfive or thirty miles south of the Tortugas and the east to southeast breezes which prevail during the spring and summer drift the surface waters of the Gulf Stream upon the Tortugas giving a reinarkable opportunity to study the life of the great tropical ocean current while at the saine time enjoying all of the advantages of a land station a combination of advantageous conditions which all who have been upon cruising expeditions will appreciate sonants are not the same I do not think the sense is changed but intend to have a new translation made Another interesting Indian manuscript in xny hands is the Mohawk version of the greater condoling songs La Forts is the Onondaga one used at the delivery of the wampum when the curtains are removed The others are sung at the wayside meeting and on the march to the councilhouse in which they usually end This version was very plainly nvritten by Chief George Key of the Grand River reservation Canada For mere con venience it is arbitrarily arranged in verses and it has the valuable feature of a division into syllables throughout The song with the names was written first perhaps as being of first importance but the remaining songs are an the order of IIales book There are slight variations from his version but none of essen tial importance except one Those who have attended a condolence will remember the con dinual repetition of  Haiii much pro longed and this hardly appears in his book In the great song with names before me it is written nearly a thousand times In the one he saw the writer may have spared him self the trouble of writing knowing just where it should be used The chiefs names occur in the usual order but some of those placed together in Mr Hales version are separated in this The variations in sense are very slight The greater songs are always used in the Mohawk rersion as this is better adapted to the music used This music I hope soon to secure NV M BEAuaHAxP Q04 MAPLE ST SYRACUSE November 19 1902 SHORTER ARTICLDE THE TORTUGAS FLORIDA AS A STATION FOR RE SEARCH IN BIOLOGY THE Tortugas Florida probably surpasses any other situation in the tropical Atlantic in the richness of its marine fauna and in natural advantages for the study of tropical life Until within recent years however the inaccessibility of the islands rendered it diffi cult to maintain even a temporary stationbYCIENCE 191 JANUARY 30 1903 S antittarunq   The manofwar hawk Fre gata aqutta and the Booby Sula suta are summer visitors Marine turtles especially the loggerhead Thatessochelys caretta were once abundant upon the Tortugas but are now becoming rare owing to indiscriminate and constant persecution A few females still crawl up on the sandy beaches from between the middle of May and the first week in August and dig their nests near the line of the bushes above the reach of the spray The eggs hatch in about six weeks and the young crawl immediately into the water The surface hauls obtained in the Tortugas appear to be richer than those gathered in the Bahama Islands and this is what we should expect from the prevailing winds which constantly drift the surface waters of the Gulf Stream upon the Tortugas whereas the Bahama Islands lie to the vnindward of the great current which as every one knowsts teems with pelagic life drawn into it from all parts of the tropical Atlantic  During the summer months the tempera ture of the air rarely exceeds 95 F The humidity is very high however although the nights are cool and the gentle breeze drifting almost constantly over the islands renders it possible to retain normal health and energy The accommodations at the Tortugas con sist in the oSicers quarters and barracks at Fort JeSerson the now deserted quarantine hospital on Bird Key and the buildings at tached to the lighthouse on ljoggerhead Key Officers of the United States government have upon all occasions displayed commend able interest in the labors of scientific men at the Tortugas and have always granted to wellqualified persons the privilege of living within the government buildings Indeed our knowledge of the Tortugas fauna is al most wholly due to the efforts of the gourern ment in forwarding research in this region and to the private eforts of Alexander Agas siz Were a permanent laboratory to be estab lished upon the Tortugas however a com fortable wellventilated wooden building ca pable of accommodating from six to twelve investigators would be required This should Not one of the pelagic animals which abound at the Tortugas has been found living permanently north of Cape Cod Massachu setts although a large number of Tortugas species are annually drifted upon the south ern coast of New DEngland by the prevailing southerly winds of the summer months The pelagic fauna of the Tortugas is on the other hand closely related to that of the Fiji Is lands both in the nature of the specimens themselves and in the relative abundance of characteristic forms although slight specific distinsetions can usually be perceived which separate the Tortugas from the Fijian forms About ten square miles of shallow reef flats lie around the Tortugas Islands and these support a fauna which for variety and abundance appears to be unsurpassed by that of any other situation in the Atlantic The Madreporaria however are poorly rep resented in the Tortugas but previous to 1878 the coral reef was remarkable for both the number and variety of species represented In October of that year a darkcolored water coming apparently from the mainland of Florida drifted out over the Tortugas reefs killing great numbers of marine animals Practically all of the stocks of Madrepora rnurciatcl were killed at this time and this coral is still extremely rare at the Tortugas only a few stocks being found at depths of two fathoms or more The genera Porites Orbtcellcl and Meondrtncl on the other hand appear to have survived in considerable num bers for many heads of these corals are now seen all being far too large to have been formed since 18t8  As a  result of one months collecting in shallow water it appears that about 265 species of marine animals are very abundant in water less than one fathom in depth while a far greater number of forms are rare or found in deeper water Several species of gulls nest upon the is lands during the summer months about four thousand of them annually

neighborhood It should be capable of making the journey to and fro between Miami or Havana and the Tortugas The time has come when American men of science should awaken to the fact that mre have at our very door a tropical fauna far surpassing in richness that of Waples With our great wealth and many able and energetic workers we should begin to perform the task for science which is being so ably done at Waples The great monographs of the Naples Laboratory should be our incentive to do even more and better things in the develop ment of knowledge concerning the marine life of tropical America ALFRED GOLDSBOROUGH MAYER MUSEUM OF THE BROOKLYN INSTITUTE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES EGGLAYING IN GONIONEMUS IPF a preliminary report on the lifehistory of Gonzonernqbs  Joqzr Borph Vol NI p 494 I stated that the cause of deposition of eggs was due to the withdrawal of lighta as the animals could be induced to deposit the eggs almost any time of day by placing them in the dark for an hour The next year 1896 some experiments were made with col ored light to find if egglaying could be brought about in more than one way and thus get nearer the cause As I was not able to continue these experiments and some one else may be in position to do so I give the substance of a few notes made at the time and the conclusion The medusa3 were ex s posed in a blackened boxa one end of which was closed with a sheet of the desired color glass First some medusa were exposed to yellow orange light for one hour The sun was not shining into the box no eggs were deposited These were then exposed for one hour to blue light cobalt glass and eggs were deposited they were abnormally slow in segmentation Next some of the animals were exposed under darker orange glass for two hours and no eggs were deposited This and a control set were then put in the dark or one hour and in both cases eggs were deposited normally Two females and a male were exposed under blue glass or one hour The sun was shining through the glass and it was therefore lighter than in the other exposure under the blue No eggs were deposited within the hour Sixteen females and one male were exposed under dark ruby glass for one hour and ten minutes the sun shining through the glass no eggs were deposited In two other trials under the ruby glass when the sun did not shine into the box eggs were deposited Im mediately after the first exposure to red above the animals were placed under blue glass and left for one hour and fifteen min utes and still no eggs were deposited It took over one and one half hours exposure to darkness before extrusion took place Whether the previous exposure to ruby light had a retarding eect or not was not deter mined The conclusion drawn was that the colors were not efective as such but merely as they obstructed the light It was also found at that time that the gonads remoa7ed from the animal deposit the sex products just as well as the intact animal L MURBACH DETROIT MICH

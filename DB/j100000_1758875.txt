sidelight which produced the same effect as the skylight with the horizontal camera Mr Smillie also attached to the side of the apparatus an endless screw whereby the distance could be readily regulated between the lens and the object to be photographed In 1871 and again in 1875 a camera of this kind was constructed specially for photographing the marine animals taken by the U S fishcommission at Woods Holl Mass Its advantages were readily seen by Professor Agassiz who asked and obtained Professor Bairds permis sion to construct for his own work a camera on a simlilar principle Not less than six thousand nega tives have been taken with the vertical camera by Mr Smillie G BRowN GOODE A tailed child The Commercial of this city for the 17th and 18th inst gave accounts of a tailed child recently born here As such cases are of scientific interest and are very rare a party of four including a prominent doctor and the writer concluded to investigate the case We found a female negrochild eight weeks old normally formed in all respects except that slightly to the left of the median line and about an inch above the lower end of the spinal column is a fleshy pedunculated protuberance about two and onehalf inches long At the base it measures one and one quarter inches in circumference A quarter of an inch from the base it is somewhat larger and from that it tapers gradually to a small blunt point It closely resembles a pigs tail in shape but shows no signs of bone or cartilage There seems to be a slight molelike protuberance at the point of attachment The appendage has grown in length about a quarter of an inch since the birth of the child The mother Lucy Clark is a quadroon seventeen years old and the father a negro of twenty both normally formed In Darwins Descent of man vol i p 28 he speaks of a similar case and refers to an article in Revue des cours scientifiques 186768 p 625 A more complete article is that by Dr Max Bartels in Archiv fiir anthropologie for 1880 He describes twentyone cases of persons born with tails most of them being fleshy protuberances like the one just described H W EATON Louisville Ky May 24 Hibernating mammals In Science No 68 Dr Merriam desires the evi dence upon which my statements concerning the hibernation of certain mammals were based to be well sifted and rightly if it is true that my observations upset the wellknown  laws that govern hiberna tion Now these laws may be in force in the Adirondack region but they are not in Central New Jersey I presume Dr Merriam will admit that the squirrels and Hesperomys occasionally take a nap during the winter that sleep is not wholly ignored by them In my original communication Science No 65 I stated very clearly that the Hesperomys slept much more during the winter months than at other times that its hibernation consisted of such additional slumber and nothing more So far as the moles are concerned I have never found evidence of activity in winter equal to that characteristic of the summer 673 months and specimens kept in captivity hibernated in the strictest sense of that term although food was kept within reach all of the time Of course star nosed moles may get out of the reach of freshets but I have never seen evidence of this and have often dug down to their burrows immediately the freshet subsided and found the animals where they were when the waters began to rise Since the appearance of Dr MTerriams critical remarks I have thought the matter over and believe it probable that these moles may close the openings to their burrows so effectually as to shut out the water from the central nest This it must be borne in mind is a supposition only In conclusion I would state that I am not given to ad ducing facts in proof of general statements Con vinced of their essential correctness I leave them with others to disprove or confirm by their independent observations In the case of the hibernation of certain mammals a comparison of my original com munication with the conclusions of my critic will show that there is no very marked difference in our impressions as to the habits of the animals named and whether extraordinary or improbable what I have said of the Hesperomys and starnosed mole is not simply substantially correct but absolutely so CIAS C ABBOTT MD May 25 THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF CANADA TIIE third session of this society was held at Ottawa commencing on the 20th of May and ending on the 23d Many members and delegates were present among the latter Dr Persifor Frazer of Philadelphia who represented the American association for the advancement of science and Dr C Hart Merriam of New York wh6 represented the American ornithological union An address of welcome was presented to the new governorgeneral of the Dominion the Marquis of Landsdowne inviting him to be come the honorary president of the society to which his Excellency returned a suitable reply The presidents address was delivered by the Hon P J O Chauveau in French and the vicepresidents by Dr T Sterry IHunt in English On the 22d of May the members and friends of tlhe society were invited by the Ottawa fieldnaturalists club to participate in an excursion to the Kings Mountain near Chelsea in the Laurentian country to the north of the city which proved eminently successfuLl The following officers were elected for the ensuing year president Dr T Sterry Hunt vicepresident Dr Daniel Wilson  treasurer Dr J A Grant reelected  honorable sec retary Mr J G Bourinot reelected The two scientific sections of the society are the third mathematical physical and chemi cal sciences and the fourth geological and JUxE 6 1884674 SCIE biological sciences  and our account covers only the more interesting or important papers in these two sections A full list will be found in our Notes In the physical section Mr F N Gisborne the superintendent of the government telegraph service described a new system devised by himself to obviate the evil effects of electrical induction in underground and aerial conduct ors A number of diagrams were presented illustrating the conditions obtaining in neigh boring circuits  and two or more circuits ar ranged in the ordinary way and the same arranged according to his method were com pared The advantages of the latter arrange ment were clearly set forth and proofs of its efficiency were presented in a tabular statement of experiments made with a section of cable about three thousand feet in length constructed under his direction and laid underground be tween two of the departmental buildings in Ottawa The cable contains twenty indiffer ently insulated conductors or wires which are divided into pairs two conductors being twisted together in each case Each pair constitutes a metallic circuit one conductor being used as a  return instead of the earthplates usually employed The peculiarity of the invention consists in the twisting of these metallic cir cuit conductors as both wires are thus made to occupy an equidistant relationship with respect to any other conductor or pair of con ductors in their vicinity It was explained that by this device a current introduced into a circuit is conducted down one wire and up the other and the position of both wires being the same with respect to neighboring circuits the inductive effect of the current passing down one wire is neutralized by the inductive effect of the same current passing up the returnwire It was also theoretically demonstrated that the twisting of the wires of the metallic cir cuits lessens the effect of induction of the current upon itself When the wires of a me tallic circuit are laid parallel throughout the current induced from one wire into the other is in the same direction as the current itself passing in that wire  the effect of the current is therefore prolonged and retardation expe rienced in a marked degree whereas when the wires are twisted closely say two turns to the inch the wires occupy throughout their length a position approaching right angles with respect to each other and the induced cur rents are thereby materially lessened and re tardation rendered less appreciable In the discussion which followed the reading NCE VOL III No 70 of the paper it transpired that if a conductor were enclosed and insulated within another conductor such for instance as a guttapercha covered wire drawn through a metal tube and both conductors were connected at either end with earthplates or other conductors so as to form two independent closed circuits the enclosel conductor might be employed to con vey electrical currents without any inductive effect being perceived in a circuit extending parallel with or in the neighborhood of the outside conductor The explanation of this condition is that the outside conductor which in this case cannot be used as a medium for communication intercepts the induced currents on all sides of the inducing circuit and in its closed circuit absorbs them As in such a system the outside conductors could not be utilized in the formation of circuits for purposes of communication it is admitted that apart from the bulkiness necessarily at tending it the first cost of construction upon that plan renders the system comparatively impractical whereas in the system advanced by Mr Gisborne the construction is much cheaper and all the conductors form an in tegral part of the communicating circuits so that space is economized to the fullest extent A good deal of interest is being manifested in this invention which Mr Gisborne has just now brought forward although it has been a subject of investigation with him for some years past the cable referred to in the paper having been ordered by the Dominion govern ment during the summer of 1882 Mr R Steckel presented a paper on the form of the contracted liquid vein affecting the pres ent theory of the science of hydraulics in which the author claims to propound a new theory of the efilux of liquids and describes experiments by which he has sought to test it Dr T Sterry Hunt in his paper on the origin of crystalline rocks maintained in op position to the plutonic and metamorphic hy potheses of the origin of these rocks a new one designated the crenitic hypothesis Greek Kp fvtq a spring according to which they were formed at an early period of the earths history by the agency of circulating subter ranean waters rising to the earths surface as springs Ie supposes the previous existence of a chaotic layer the lastcongealed portion of a globe consolidating from the centre which layer rendered porous and permeated by waters gave up to them the materials of quartz and the felspars after the manner of zeolites to be deposited at the surface The action of nonaluminous silicates allied to pectolite or theJUNE 6 1884 S CIE magnesian salts in seawater was the source of serpentine pyroxene etc The gradual re moval by solution from below of vast quantities of material and the iresulting contraction of the primitive stratum caused the universal corru gations of the upper acidic or gneissic layer From the undissolved basic residual portion have come such eruptive rocks as melaphyres and basalts while granitic and trachytic rocks are softened and displaced portions of the acidic or secondary layer TIhe author has developed at length this hypothesis which according to him affords a satisfactory expla nation of many hitherto unsolved problems in geology In a paper on the density and the thermal expansion of aqueous solutions of sulphate of copper Prof J G MacGregor gave an account of extended observations made to determine the density of solutions of differ ent degrees of concentration and at different temperatures As a general result of the ex periments it is shown 1 that the rate of vari ation of density with temperature in all cases increases with the temperature and with the degree of concentration 2 that at low tem peratures below about 25 C the rate of change of density with temperature is for all solutions greater than the same rate for water 3 that the difference between these rates diminishes as the temperature increases and 4 that for most solutions probably for all these rates are at sufficiently high temperatures 3050 the same as for water ie the thermal expansion of solutions is the same as that of water at these telmperatures The experiments also substantiate a result formerly obtained by Professor Ewing and the author that very weak solutions of this salt have a volume smaller than that of the amount of water which they contain Prof E IIHanel gave a continuation of his paper presented to the society last year on blowpipe reactions on plasterofparis tablets in which he described the effect of treating copper with hydrobromic acid and iron with hydriodic acid and showed how to distinguish between selenium and mercury He described also the coatings per se for the above tablets for selenium tiemannite arsenic silver alloys of bismuth lead and antimony with silver galena orpiment realgar mercury tellurium carbon cadmium and gold The same author gave a description of ap paratus for distinguishing flamecoloring con stituents when occurring together in an assay The apparatus consists of a spectacleframe furnished for the left eye with plain colorless NCE 675 glass and for the right eye with four glasses red green violet and blue These glasses revolve on an axis and can be brought either separately or in any combination before the right eye of the operator Prof N F Dupuis showed how to develop by simple algebraical methods certain functions ordinarily developed by the aid of the calculus Prof E J Chapman described a series of analyses of magnetic and other iron ores from samples obtained by him personally from vari ous parts of Ontario The geological condi tions of the deposits were also briefly given In the geological and biological section Dr A 1 C Selwyn gave an account of his observations in 1883 on the geology of a part of the north shore of Lake Superior in which he considered he was able to show that the great masses of columnar trap which form the summit of Thunder Cape Pie Island and McKays Mountain were not part of a  crown ing overflow as they have been described to be and newer than the Keweenawan series but that they are contemporaneous with the black slaty shales of the Animikie group which imimnediately and conformably underlie them Professor George Lawson presented a re vision of the Canadian Ranunculaceae The author referred to his monograph of Ranuncu laceae published in 1870 to the extensive col lections that had been subsequently made and to works published upon the NorthAmerican flora  all of which enabled a fuller and more accurate description of Canadian ranunculace ous plants to be given now than was possible when the previous paper was prepared The greater precision given to recent observation had also enabled the geographical range of these plants to be stated more fully The striking diversity of modification in the form number and arrangement of the several parts of the flower and of the fruit in the several gen era was pointed out The number of Cana dian species is seventyeight and of varieties eighteen Dr T Sternr Hunt presented a second part of his essay on the Taconic question in geol ogy in which he endeavored to show in the first place more fully than has yet been done the relations of the Taconian or lower Taconic series of stratified rocks to the succeeding Cambrian or upper Taconic which some geol ogists have confounded with the Taconian In this connection is given a critical discussion of the studies of Perry Marcou and others and the opinions of Dana as regards the Cam brian of the Appalachian region of North America In the second place is considered676 SCIE the probable equivalence of the Taconian to the Itacolumnite series of Brazil and to similar rocks elsewhere in South America and the WestIndian Islands as well as in Hindostan and southern Europe All of these compara tive studies it is said tend to establish the distinctness of the Taconian as a great and widely spread series of crystalline stratified rocks occupying a horizon between the Cam brian and the Mlontalban or younger gneiss series of Europe and North America Some deposits of titaniferous iron ore in the counties of HIaliburton and Hastings Ontario were discussed by Prof E J Chapman After referring to the occurrence of numerous depos its of magnetic iron ore in certain zones or belts of country in the counties of Victoria Haliburton Peterborough and Hastings he described their conditions of occurrence as those of large isolated masses or  stocks  forming in some cases sheathed stocks or stockscheiders and skblars of German and Swedish miners  as in the great ironore zone of Arendal in Norway While these stock masses of iron ore are for the greater part quite free from titanium one of vast size in the township of Glamorgan and another equally large mass in Tudor are shown to contain a considerable amount of titanium Detailed descriptions of these were given with analyses of the ore Prof E J Chapman also read an essay on mimetism in inorganic nature Mimetism as recognized in organic nature has been re garded on the one hand as the direct result of a protecting Providence and on the other as originating in minute approaches towards the imitated object these becoming intensified in successive generations until the imitation be comes complete or reaches its extreme limit In this paper the writer attempts to show that neither hypothesis may be absolutely correct but that the peculiarity may be due to some occult law of  localism by which associated forms often become impressed with mutual re semblances In support of this view he refers to several curious cases in which certain min erals normally and generally of very dissimilar aspect become closely mimetic under certain local conditions as seen in examples of quartz and zircon pyroxene and apatite etc in the phosphate deposits of the Ottawa region A monograph of Canadian ferns was offered to the society by Dr T J W Burgess and Prof J Macoun Professor Macoun stated that twenty years ago the total number of ferns known to occur in Canada was fortysix while at the present time it had increased to sixty N CE VOL III No 70 three In illustrating the range of the more interesting species he particularly noticed the occurrence of Phegopteris calcarea in Anti costi where he had found it in 1882 and re marked that the same plant had recently been collected by Drs G M Dawson and R Bell in the country around and to the east of the Lake of the Woods Prof L W Bailey in a paper on geological contacts and ancient erosion in the Province of New Brunswick summarized the more impor tant and wellestablished lines of physical con tact between the geological formations of New Brunswick as bearing upon the relative age of the latter and the disturbances to which they have been subjected Three wellmarked breaks separating groups of widely diverse character were recognized among preCam brian strata the supposed equivalents of Laurentian Huronian and possibly Montalban horizons a very marked one at the base of the Cambrian and others successively between later formations to the base of the trias The evidence of such breaks was shown to be of various character including discordance of dip and strike overlap igneous extravasations and intermediate erosion  and the bearing of the facts determined on the physical and geo logical history of northeastern America was briefly discussed The granites which con stitute so marked a feature in the geology of the Acadian provinces were described as in trusive and as the cause of the extensive alteration exhibited by the formations which they have invaded The erosion which ac companied or followed upon the disturbances described was shown to have been enormous Mr G F Matthew continued his illustra tions of the fauna of the St John group by presenting a paper on the Conocoryphidae with notes on the Paradoxidae The species of Con ocoryphe referred to and illustrated are C Matthewi Iartt with three varieties C ele gans Hartt C Baileyi Hartt with two varie ties and a new form which the author describes as C Walcotti Critical remarks are also made upon Paradoxides lamellatus Hartt and P acadicus In a description of a supposed new am monite from the upper cretaceous rocks of Fort St John on the Peace River Mr J F Whit eaves considered it to be an undescribed species of Prionocyclus closely allied to the type of that genus Ammonites Woolgari of Sowerby but with much more closely coiled volutions It occurs in flattened nodules in shales which are believed to be the equivalents of the Fort Benton group of the Upper Missouri section   I

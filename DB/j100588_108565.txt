FURNISHED THE REQUISITE ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE FOLLOWING MEMOIR ON SOME EXTINCT HERBIVOROUS ANIMALS WHICH INDICATE A PRIMARY GROUP OF THE UNGULATA DISTINCT FROM AND PROBABLY EQUIVALENT TO ONE OF THE GREAT DIVISIONS CALLED PROBOSCIDIA ARTIODACTYLA AND PERISSODACTYLA GENUS NESODON  O THE GENUS SO CALLED FROM MOST OF THE ENAMELFOLDS PENETRATING THE CROWN OF THE MOLARS BEING WHEN EXPOSED BY USE OF AN

CONTRIBUTOR OF MATERIALS TOWARDS THE ADVANCEMENT OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE ANCIENT ZOOLOGY OF SOUTH ATNERICA MORE EXTEN SIVE PORTIONS OF BOTH UPPER AND LOWER JAWS WITH TEETH OF THE GENERIC CHARACTER OF

ARTICULARIS OF TGLENOID CAVITY AND OF THE POSTGLENOID PROCESSAND BY THOSE ALSO OF THE LACRYMAL BONE OF THE ZYGOMATIC ARCH AND OF THE ORBITTHE TOXODONTIA ARE MOST CLOSELY MATCHED BY THE TAPIR AND RHINOCEROS IN THE PERISSODACTYLE ORDER THE DENTAL AND OSTEOLOGICAL CHARACTERS DETAILED IN THE TEXT WHILST THEY ILLUSTRATE THE CLOSER MUTUAL AFFINITIES BETWEEN THE NESODONS AND TOXODONS ESTABLISH THEIR CLAIM TO BE REGARDED AS TYPES OF A DISTINCT ORDER OF UNGULATA AND THEY ALSO TEND TO DIS SIPATE MUCH OF THE OBSCURITY SUPPOSED TO INVOLVE THE TRUE NATURE OF THE GENUS TOXODON AND TO RECONCILE THE CONFLICTING OPINIONS AS TO ITS PROPER PLACE IN THE MAMMALIAN CLASS THE FOSSILS ABOVE DESCRIBED WERE DISCOVERED ON THE COAST OF PATAGONIA TO THE SOUTH OF PORT ST JULIAN AND MY FRIEND MR CHARLES DARWIN FRS HAS KINDLY COM MUNICATED TO ME THE FOLLOWING OPINION AS TO THE FORMATION IN WHICH THEY WERE IMBEDDED  THESE BEDS RESEMBLE MINERALOGICALLY THE UPPER ANCIENT TERTIARY FORMA TION OF PATAGONIA BUT EHRENBERG FOUND THE INCLUDED MICROSCOPICAL ORGANISMS WHOLLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE ANCIENT TERTIARY FORMATION BEING OF FRESHWATER AND BRACKISH ORIGIN P 117 OF MY GEOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS ON SOUTH AMERICA HENCE THESE BEDS ARE OF UNKNOWN AGE PROBABLY YOUNGER THAN THE OLD TERTIARY AND OLDER THAN THE SUPERFICIAL BEDS IN WHICH MACRAUCHENIA WAS FOUND  MEMOIR ON THE ANTHRACOTHERIOID ANIMALS IN

terrane advanced by certain Neocene palmeon tologists There remain still many problems in the stratigraphy and chro nology of Gay Head Next year will doubtless offer opportunities for fresh conclusions at least on subordinate points to my friend or any other geologist There may even be good reasons for the sincere entertainment of almost fundamentally different opinions on the part of an equally skilful observer Among other problems not merely local is the circumstance that notwithstanding the incompatibility and irrationality of the idea in view of present contirnntal geography and topography no other inherent evidence has I believe been found as to the depo sition of the clays and sands of this series except such as tends to support the view of Professor Uhler that these middle or lower Cretaceous terranes are essentially fresh water formations DAVID WHITE Washington DC Nov 16 On the Vernacular Name of the Genus Harporhynchus THAT wellknown genus of American birds of which Harpo rhynchus rufus is the type is almost universally called in Eng lish by every ornithologist or indeed by every one who knows the species in the United States a Thrasher In New England and to the southward and westward it is known as the Brown Thrasher We find it printed Thrasher in the A 0 U Check List without any synonymic term or terms as is also the case in such an authorative work as Couess Key to North American Birds Now it is of interest to know that our British ornitho logical friends call these birds Threshers spelled with an e in the first syllable instead of an a Recently Professor Alfred Newton submitted me the proof of a contribution of mine to his extensive work on Ornithology now passing through the press wherein this word occurred spelled Thrasher in my text but Thresher in a supplementary note of his own Upon his attention being called to it I received from him the following in his reply I have not the least wish to interfere with your use of Thrashers there is some authority for it among English writers but I be lieve Thresher to be more correct A S perscan or pirscan Mid Engl preschen Chaucer threshen Seal preskja Old Dutch derschen Germ dreschen Gothic thrisken and prefer that form for my own use  though of course giving it the sound of short A as in many other words eg Derby Thrash would seem to indicate a pronunciation like Thrash almost tbrarsh  which is local and vulgar A N This communication is dated Magdalene College Cambridge England Nov 12 1892 Accord ing to this it would seem that our old timehonored name of Thrasher strictly speaking should give way to the more correct appellation of Thresher R W SHUFELDT Takoma D C Nov 29 Meteoric Shower THE meteoric shower here on the evening of Nov 23 was very fine The average of several observations from 7 to 10 PM  gave 250 goodsized meteors per minute with a great many very small ones resembling a fiery dust The meteors appeared to radiate from a point nearly overhead at 9 PM C W KEMPTON Austerlitz Mine Oro Blanco Pima County Ariz Nov 26 Remains of the Mastodon Recently Found in Ttnnessee NEAR Nieberts Springs seven miles south east of Knoxville some workmen recently unearthed four molar teeth of the masto don which were in a fair state of preservation They were found beneath about thirty inches of yellow tenaceous clay containing waterworn stones The largest tooth measured sixteen inches in circumference and bears on its grinding surface one small and four large ridges which are covered to the depth of one fourth of an inch with perfectly preserved enamel The smallest tooth measures twelve inches in circumference and has only three transverse ridges whose surfaces are so worn as to expose the 333 dentine in a number of places The roots are so decayed and broken that it is impossible to determine their original length or Dumber The University of Tennessee has in its possession other remains recently found in Hawkins County of this State These consist of part of a tusk measuring twentytwo inches in circumference by twelve inches in length and a molar tooth with only two ridgos The tooth is well preserved but the tusk is much de cayed S W MCCALLIE Uuiversity of Tennessee Knoxville Tenn The HummingBirds Food THE notes that have recently appeared in Science regarding the hummingbirds food would seem to show that the birds taste varies with the locality In southern New York their favorite flower is the swampthistle Cirstum muticum No better place could be selected for studying the feedinghabits of the ruby throats than a spot where these flowers abound Dr Gibbs thinks the individual flowers of the red clover too small for the rubythroats attention but in the thistles the flowers are even smaller Since it has been said that the bee gets pollen but not honey from the thistle it would appear that the birds visit these flowers for insects There is scarcely a flower that contains so many minute insects as a thistlehead Examine one with a lens and it will be found to contain many insects that can hardly be seen with the unaided eye If the rubythroat eats insects at all these are the ones it would take and because the larger ones remained the observer might conclude that none were eaten WILLARD N CLUTE Bitghampton New York Nov 21 AMONG THE PUBLISHERS GENERAL TAYLOR a biography by MajorGeneral 0 0 Howard U S A will follow

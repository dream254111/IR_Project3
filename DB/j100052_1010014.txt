j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1010014,The Progress of Southern Education,i242557,THE PROGRESS OF SOUTHERN EDUCATION By JOSEPHUS DANIELS ESQ of Raleigh N C There have been four great obstacles to educational progress in North Carolina I The negro enfranchised against the protest of the people who were forced against their will to pay a tax to educate him 2 Povertygrinding povertyfollowing war and reconstruc tion such as this generation cannot know 3 The lack of qualified teachers and the lack of inducement to capable men and women to become teachers 4 High mountain ranges and numerous water courses in the west where people live far apart and where compact school districts are impossible and great pocosins or swamps in portions of the east which present the same barriers to consolidation in many parts of the coast region that the mountain ranges present in the west These four obstacles but the greatest of these has been is now and must be at least in this generation the negro He has been the lion in the path the ever present and often insurmountable obstacle to public education There are those who assert that many opponents of taxation for public education on other grounds use the expenditure of money for negro education as a pretext and that if no share of public money went to educating the negro they would still oppose taxes for public education That may be true with some but the naked truth is that much of the money from taxation I had almost said the bulk of itthat has gone to negro education has been given against the judgment of Southern taxpayers Here where we are seeking to get at the real facts so that the best results may follow there is no need to look at things except just as they areto paint the picture as it really iswarts freckles and all Is it surprising that the Southern people in the ashes of a poverty that pride largely concealed from the world resented the enfranchisement of their slaves Is it surprising that they cried out against being taxed to educate the children of negroes newly freed when the losses of war sent their own children unused to manual work into the fields to perform the coarsest labors  When C310The Progress of Southern Education zealous women from the North with the missionary instinct to uplift the negro came South and themselves taught the negroes and in some cases mingled with them upon terms of social equality is it strange that the Southern people felt that these teachers had come South to put the bottom rail on top And when in some instances their teaching seemed at first to produce among some of the worst young negroes a vicious attitude is Southern hostility to negro education surprising When the statement is published upon the authority of leading teachers that the census reports show the negro to be four and a half times more criminal in New England where the negroes are better educated than in the black belt where illiteracy is greatest is it a matter of astonishment that men declare today that negro education is a failure The marvel of it all is not that many Southern people cried out against paying taxes to educate negroes believing that it did them no good but that notwithstanding their utter disbelief in its good results or their skepticism of its value they have gone on year after year spending more and more money to educate the negro children Nor must it ever be forgotten that all over the South before I860 good women had taught slaves to read and write so that when emancipation came there were not a few negroes who had been in an educational sense made fit for suffrage The Southerners believed then they believe now they always will believe with Henry Ward Beecher We should make the negro worthy first before giving him suffrage Tourgees hindsight better than his foresight caused him to prove that in the contrary policy pursued the attempt was to make bricks without straw There are many Southern people who believe thoroughly in educat ing the negro and believe that it helps him and the whole country and their unselfish efforts in his behalf are beyond all praise There are thousands and tens of thousands who do not believe in it at all and who are frank to say that in their judgment it does nobody good There are others who seeing the examples of negroes who have been helped by education and being surrounded by negroes whose smattering of education has done them harm are halting between two opinions There are othersand in this class I believe most of the thoughtful people of the South are to be foundwho feel that whatever may be the result they dare not shut the door of hope and opportunity which education may open to any people 3 1 67Thze Annals of the American Academy anywherethe negro in the South the Indian in the West the Filipino in Manila They do not expect of education that it will change the negro rapidly They know to the contrary They hope they believe they trust that eventually it will prove beneficial because they have faith that light and knowledge will surely bless wherever they abound The eloquent Southern Methodist bishop George F Pierce regarded by Toombs as the most eloquent of Georgians was once asked if he believed that the heathen would be saved if the Chris tians refused to send the Gospel to them It is not a question to you my friend replied the bishop whether the heathen will be saved if you do not help to send them the Gospel That is Gods business He commands you to send the Gospel The question for you to consider is Will you be saved if you disobey Gods com mand to send it  With this last class the question is not Can I demonstrate by statistics by mathematics by investigation to my perfect satisfac tion whether negro education is worth what it costs The ques ti9n is Would I dare to say to any human being You shall not have the chance which education may give of improving your mental moral and physical welfare Since I870 according to Hon W T Harris United States Commissioner of Education Report of U S Corn of Ed I889 I900 volume II page 2501 the South has spent Io9oooooo for negro education North Carolina alone has spent 538077074 Now if this money had been spent by people who sincerely believed it was being well invested these figures would not seem so large but when it is remembered that the majority of the men who paid this money either disbelieved entirely in the education of the negro were skeptical as to its value or favored it as Bishop Pierce said men must consider foreign missions it is seen to be all things con sidered the most remarkable and astounding investment of money that any people ever made The second obstacle to educational progress in the South has been poverty For almost a century most of the savings of the Southern people most of the Souths surplus of wealth had been invested in slaves In I86o the reported value of slaves was 60000000 If without any devastation of war any loss of earning capacity by the men 312 68The Progress of Southern Education killed or wounded in battle or diseased by exposure incident to camp life this immense sum of money had been taken from the South it would have been wretchedly poor Add to the loss of the accumu lations and savings of many years the losses in other property which the vanquished must always bear in war the even greater calamity in the death and maiming of its strongest and best bread winners and some faint idea of the poverty which the South faced in 1865 may be grasped This utter abject poverty involving the denial of the common necessities can never be known or appre ciated But the South is still poor I know that this will be denied by those who take a superficial view or think all the South is as rich as the Carolina truck gardens the Virginia cities the Texas oil wells or the Alabama coal fields The South is growing richer every day It is developing its resources its young men have gone to work in the factory the mine the field on every hand you see evidences of prosperity The future of the South industrially is assured Out of the poverty of war out of the disaster of recon struction by twenty years of welldirected industry it has built large cities and established great industries But while it has done wonders in these short years and laid the foundation for greater prosperity the South is relatively still poor The Southern Edu cator says that Ioooooo people live in log houses in Georgia In every state there are thousands whose incomes are so small as to make everything beyond the common necessities of life impossible There are fewer of these every year thanks to the building of rail roads which open new markets and avenues of wealth and the varied industrial development which is blessing the South But it will be generations before the South catches up with other sections of the Republic and recovers from the losses of war and reconstruc tion But she will do it Her sons are strong robust industrious confident selfreliant ready and willing to work with head and hand In the face of all the progress it is making I know it is not popular to say that the South is poor but those who are acquainted with the rural conditions know that while grinding poverty has passed the bulk of the people have succeeded as yet in making but small accumulations The third obstacle has been the lack of trained teachers and the lack o incentive to capable men to become teachers 313 69The Annals of the American Academy Most of the male teachers between 1865 and i880 were Con federate soldiers many of them teaching to secure bread Thev had gone into the army from schools in which they had but begun their education With one leg or one arm gone they were unfit when the war was over for the manual labor which their comrades undertook Equipped with meagre education but rigid discipline they taught the children the three rs and in the recess delighted them with stories of the war I knew such a teacher big of heart and brave as a lion who left a leg at Gettysburg who was one of the most popular teachers in his community He knew how to maintain discipline he could teach and teach thoroughlyup to partial paymentsand he could describe a battle with such graphic vividness as to make the hair of his pupils stand on end For twenty dollars a month for three months in the year that noble soldier was the pioneer postbellum leader in public education in his neighborhood He would not shine in a teachers institute but he taught the rudiments thoroughly and sowed the seed from which this generation is reaping The short terms and low salaries have not encouraged men and women to become teachers but the call to teach has in every year been heard and heeded by thousands who have found a compensa tion that is priceless in the love and gratitude of their students And so though the pay has been small the schools have been manned by teachers worth ten times the salary that they received Better normal instruction has provided better teachers the growing prosperity has multiplied graded schools which have offered better inducements to teachers and this obstacle of the lack of trained teachers is year by year disappearing People who live in compact communities can have little appre ciation of the obstacle to adequate public schools to be found in a sparse population In the mountains and in the low country the population is widely scattered and it is where the people live farthest apart the least progress has been made But even where the environ ment makes strongest against progress the people are becoming aroused to the necessity of better schools and longer terms and are bridging swamps and climbing mountains to give their sons and daughters a better chance in life So much for the obstacles We are alreadythe world is alreadyfamiliar with the statistics of illiteracy the figures showing 3I4 70The Progress of Southern Education appropriations for schools and the general spirit of enthusiasm and hope that pervades the South I have dwelt upon the serious obstacles because I have often thought that in some quarters the South has been too harshly judged by men who read nothing but statistics I am more familiar with North Carolinaits improvement as indicated by official figures and in the changed and improved and improving public sentimentand will confine myself to the devel opment in that state which has the distinction of being a leader in this and other progressive educational movements The story of North Carolina fairly tells the story of progress of all the Southern states I can remember when there was not a single city town or vil lage or a school district in North Carolina that levied a special tax for public schools and at that time the general school tax provided a fund that afforded only the most inefficient shortterm schools The first town that voted a local tax for graded schools was Greensboro in I874 Today there are seventyeight local tax dis tricts that support their public schools by public taxation quite a number of country districts are doing so and within the past year a large number of towns and school districts have voted a local tax to establish graded schools The legislature of I903 passed more special acts for establishing graded schools and erecting public school buildings than ever before in the history of the state But these figures in themselves do not adequately convey the real progress Many school districts have been consolidatedthat work is going on every month wisely and rapidlyand this is all preparatory to an accelerated increase in the number of districts that will within the next few years vote a special tax to improve the public schools in village and in rural district for almost every town of any importance now has its graded school supported by taxation A concrete example in one growing town will illustrate the new and better condition in the whole state It was my good for tune to grow up in the village in eastern North Carolina that had the best private schools and academies in that section of the state Twentyfive years ago in the town of Wilson there was a flourishing womans seminary and a prosperous academy for boys and young men They attracted students from twenty counties and had famous instructors and splendid wooden buildings But the public school 3I5 71The Annals of the American Academy open only about two months during the vacation of the private schools was taught in an abandoned carriage factory The teachers were good but the crowded classes and short terms made the public school largely a failure Few parents who could pay tuition thought of depending upon them A magnificent brick building costing 50ooo00 has been erected for a useful and strong denominational col lege The people have recently built a 35000 brick building for its excellent public graded school for white children Commodious and wellequipped btiildings had previously been erected for the graded schools for the negro children The change in most other communities has been even more marked for in many there were only indifferent and small private schools before the establishment of graded schools In those a transformation greater and more uplifting than any array of figures would indicate has been wrought for the influence of these schools of democracy has touched every phase of community life to bless it The progress in what we call higher education has been most gratifying In 1875 the doors of the State Universitythe oldest and one of the foremost institutions of learning in the South with an illustrious historywere closed Only one college had a dollar of endowment and that had been seriously impaired by war In 1875 only about three hundred young men were matriculated in all the colleges Today there are not less than twentyfive hundred Within the past fifteen years the state has established two great industrial institutionsthe A and M College for white boys at Raleigh and the A and M College for colored boys at Greensboro The aggregate appropriations and expenditures at both have been threequarters of a million dollars At Greensboro the state has established for women the State Normal and Industrial College the success of which has been almost phenomenal It represents the expenditure of more than half a million dollars in ten years The appropriation from the state treasury has been increased from 12500 to 40000 a year The state has added largely to the institution for the blind at Raleigh and erected commodious and modern buildings for a model school for the deaf and dumb children at Morgantown costing 200000 Private benefaction has con structed five new buildings at the University at a cost of over 20000o The appropriations from the state treasury for the Uni 3i6 72Thc Progress of Southern Education versity which reopened in 1876 with a state appropriation of 7500 per year have been increased to 37500 per year Eight normal schools for the training of teachers for the negro schools are main tained by the state at locations convenient and accessible The private academies and preparatory schools North Carolina from its earliest history has always been blessed with a few private schools worthy to rank with the best in England or New England have multiplied in numbers and attendance doing a great and needed work filling the gap between the public schools and the colleges The denominational colleges have gone forward steadily and rapidly The endowment in one alone Trinity College coming almost wholly from two menfather and sonhas grown to some thing like half a million Wake Forest has increased to a quarter of a million Davidson to a quarter of a million Elon during the past year received a handsome donation The endowments in the denominational colleges for women have not been so great but these colleges have shown a growth that tells mightily the story of the belief in educating women that has been the distinguishing educa tional characteristic of the state during the past ten years New colleges for women have been established and grown to great useful ness in a single year Among the most important forward steps that the state has lately taken I must name three I The legislature has now for four years made an appropria tion of 1ooooo a year out of the general funds to be applied to the schools in the poorer counties whose revenues are not sufficient to bring their school terms up to the constitutional requirement 2 It has made appropriations of I2500 for free rural libraries in connection with the public schools which supplemented by the counties and private subscriptions will amount to 37500 3 The general assembly which adjourned last month recog nizing that the pressing need in public education is better school houses upon the recommendation of the states able and wise superintendent of schools one of the first educators in wisdom and in executive ability in America today set aside the sum of 200000 and all funds hereafter arising from the sale of thousands of acres of public lands belonging to the state to be a Permanent Loan Fund for Building and Improving Public Schoolhouses 317 73The Annals of the American Academy The State Board of Education is directed to lend this money at 4 per cent to school districts which have not the money to build schoolhouses to be repaid in ten annual instalments This sum will be used to supplement local appropriations and contributions If it could be doubled and the entire school fund a large part of which has necessarily been used to build schoolhouses could be used exclusively to employ teachers the good result which we confi dently expect in ten years would be accomplished within one year I believe this is the most important step taken in public education in any Southern state You cannot secure a full attendance without comfortable schoolhouses Good schoolhouses must be at the foundation of all permanent progress in public education The loan fund established by North Carolina has the germ of the best work possible of early accomplishment that philanthropists and legislators can undertake These facts tell in outline the story of the educational progress in North Carolina as far as it can be told by brick mortar statutes and appropriations These are the visible signs of the revival that has like a living fire touched the minds and hearts of the people of the state But as the spirit is always superior to the material these facts and figures cannot convey the full story of the wonderful progress that this generation has witnessed That story will be found in the newer life of intellectual and industrial activity that dominates the South today and that will lead it into larger fields in the days that are to come North Carolinas contribution to the educational revival is found mainly within the state for the true Tarheel is ever mindful of the injunction Beginning at Jerusalem Perhaps we stay there too long and preach too much only to the saints But North Carolina has furnished educational leaders not only for its own schools and colleges but has furnished educational leaders also for the South and elsewhere Page of New York Alderman of Louisiana Branson of Georgia Pell of South Carolina Barringer of Virginia Houston of Texas all prominently connected with the Southern Education Conference and its work are natives of North Carolina while Wood row Wilson spent his boyhood in Wilmington and Dabney and Claxton of Tennessee D B Johnson of

North Carolina long enough to be indoctrinated with proper ideas of educational leadership Its present governor Charles B Aycock and Georgias foremost citizen Hoke Smith were both born in North Carolina Among public leaders in the educational progress of today the names of these two North Carolinians lead all the rest Today with this backward glance at what has been accom plished in spite of the negro burden the swamps and mountains the sparseness of population the lack of trained teachers and pov erty North Carolinians having come up out of great tribulations and rejoicing that they have reached Appi Forum thank God and take courage That good state is happy in that though the harvest is great it is ripe for the sickle and the laborers are not few Among the causes of congratulation today is the fact that at last the South has the sympathy and the cooperation of the most patriotic and broadminded men of the Republicmen who are moved by the highest motives and the purest patriotism in their interest in Southern education

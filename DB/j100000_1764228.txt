liberality of the credulous The changes in the elevation of the Caspian Sea and the Baltic have been discussed by Dr Bruckner in a lecture delivered at the meeting of the German Meteorological Society at Iarlsruhe and by W Seibt  Das Mittelwasser der Ostsee bei Travemunde  Both authors show by their separate methods that the influence of the wind upon lakes has been overrated and that the annual rain fall regulates the amount of water in lakes and seas communicating with the ocean through narrow channels The amount of xvater carried by the Volga regulates the elevation of the surface of the Caspian Sea and the same is the case with the Black Sea and its afiluents Bruckner shows that the easterly winds of May and the westerly winds of July and August have an influence upon the Baltic but the thorough discussion of the gauge observations at Travemunde by 07V Seibt proves that only in April May and Sep tember the height of the water corresponds to the direction and pressure of the wind It appears that the volume of water of the Baltic is subject to periodical changes While Bruckner believes that this is entirely due to the changes of the annual rainfall Seibt concludes that a periodical annuaI tide exists in the ocean which is observed only in seas in which the daily tide is insignificant  Over 60oooooo caterpillarcocoons were destroyed on the trees in Washington during

Licking County is selected see  Ancient Monuments by Squier and Davis Plate xxv F Running this by means of short chords of seventyfive feet in length taking the middle line of the top of the wall I found the number to be 44 and twelve feet in addition orthe perimeter of the polygon 33I2 feet The course of each chord was taken While the variation from one to the other if the figure were a true circle should be about 8 9 it was found to vary from one to fifteen de grees But somewhat to my surprise it was found that these variations compensated each other in short distances so that in measuring the quarters they almost wholly disappear the angle of the first quarter being 44 52 and its chord 747 feet the angle of the second quarter 45 and its chord 745 feet of the third quarter 44 52 and the chord 744 feet the fourth quarter was not measured owing to obstructions It is therefore apparent that the figure as a whole is very near a true circle But the most singular fact is presented by the diameters These as taken by careful measurements from the quarterstations are respectively IO54 and IO58 feet the average of which is IO56 feetfi precisely sixtyfour poles or sixteen

phenomenon especially when un usual or little studied is worthy of record we have put down a few notes about a series of waterspouts which passed here on Monday May 23 shortly after noon One of us saw at one time from ar elevation of about one hundred and fifty feet as many as nine ir various stages of their formation the other eight at an elevatiorl of fifty feet we lDeing about half a mile apart and some persons claim to have seen twelve in all Alassio is situated on a bay or rather roadstead which is about five miles from headland to headland in a straight line from that line to our zlillas is at least two miles On the 22d there was a severe storm throughout north Italy ex tending from Padua to Turin accompanied by hail and frost The mountains behind Genoa and all along the coast were again cov ered xvith snow This storm appeared to divide and while going through the mountains to the north not seen from here passed us about three miles out at sea at about I I AM Then there was no wind the sea was unusually smooth in the bay but the line of the storm was strongly marked and the roaring of the waves was distinctly heard A little later we had a very slight shower The morning of the 23d was unusually electrical so much so as to make every one feel uneasy and restless The wind dropped and there was a dead calm At a little after twelve we were called out by our gardeners and servants and looking out at seab saw a long black cloud lying in a straight line across the bay from which long descending tubessome straight as if drawn with a rule others txvisted like snakes were moving rapidly in proces sion in a southwesterly direction The surface of the sea boiled and the foam and spray rose many feet into the air with a loud roaring plainly heard on land In some cases as these tubes ap proached the sea with their dangling ends the water seemedt gradually to rise and meet them In other cases the ends swayeds to and fro above the waves either forming no connection with them or having already begun to break up In nearly every case the SCIENCEJ ULY I 5 I 887 SCIENCE The balloon is held captive by a threestrand insulated wire  hollow tube was distinctly visible the centre being clear like glass while the outside was wrapped in a smokelike mist Even with the naked eye we could distinctly see a spiral motion on the inside of the tube as if water were either ascending or descending in which direction it was irnpossible to tell Beyond the waterspouts be tween the cloud and the sea a blue sky with sunlit cumulus clouds was plainly seen These tubes moved at the rate of more than thirty miles an hour judgingfrom the time ordinarily taken by steamers in crossing the same space Estimates of the height of the cloud are difficult to make but at least half the tubes were seen over the promotory of Capo delle Mele which is about one thousand feet high and distant about five miles as the crow flies from the point of observation The phenomenon caused a great panic among the inhabitants owing to theiprediction of Falb that there would be a violent earth quake on that day There was subsequently a slight storm of hail and rain but farther westward on the coast the damage done was considerable at San Remo secular olive trees being torn up by the roots and whirled away No waterspout is however known to have burst on the land MAURICE HOWARD EUGENE SCHUYLER Alassio Riviera Italy May 26 How to make Meteorological Observations at a Distance above the Earths Surface THE progress of meteorology in the beaten tracks of the usual observations is very satisfactory but there are several new lines of work thal can be and ought to be carried out that receive scarcely more than an occasional mention or a regret that some body does not do something in the matter The observation of the conditions of the atmosphere above the earths surface is perhaps the most important of these questions I know of no meteorologi cal data so much to be desired as that which is now obtained for short irregular intervals by the occasional ascent of a balloon This however is a very expensive and risky method of observa tion and has always been looked upon as a novelty rather than a regular method The few observations made in balloonvoyages together with those obtained by means of an occasional captiveballoon ascent are very valuable and have been used over and over again in de termining constants The great expense of even a captive balloon where the observer must go up has prevented their general intro duction into meteorological work It has often been proposed to send up selfregistering instruments in smaller captive balloons but if this has been done I have not seen accounts of it The lighter forms metal thermometer and aneroid barometer could undoubtedly be used in this way but the ordinary registeringapparatus is very delicate and the swaying of the balloon might disturb the adjustments besides the original cost of the apparatus is considerable and moreover any damage could not be easily repaired In place of a balloon the kite has been suggested and E Doug lass Archibald has made some interesting preliminary experiments with this method I have seen only the account of his experiments as given in the MeZeoroZogzschve ZeitschrsXt for I885 p 47 but in this paper there are references to lMature Nov 20 I884 and 2uarterSy Jomr naS January T 883  Mr Archibald flies two kites the one to steady the other He carried on systematic observations with arl anemometer six inches in diameter for a year and finally got results for a height of eleven hundred feet above the ground I saw this paper on Mr Archibalds work a few days ago for the first time but it interested me very much as I had been consider ing the same problem A year and a half ago I devised a form of apparatus that would seem to promise good results but it was only some months ago that I suggested the following detailed construc tion which is given here for the benefit of any who might wish to carry on any such experiments The general form is seen in Fig I and consists of a balloon 5 which carries a basket 4 suspended from beneath and the basket carrying arl anemometer 6 with a weight below it 33 which is wound around a reel 2 and passes to a table 1 where the battery and keys are mounted The reel 2 must be firmly anchored and the wires arranged so there will be no danger from electric currents A cloth ring with the length of rope from the balloon written on it can be glued to the rope at every hundred feet so that the observer can see just how much rope is out and by means of some instru  ment for measuring vertical angles the altitude of the balloon carL be measured and the height of the baloon computed The apparatus as shown in Fig 2 might also be sent up in a balloon held captive by an ordinary rope if a small bichromateof potash battery with closed hardrubber cells and a clockwork to break the circuit esery five or ten minutes is also included The whole apparatus might also be sent up on a kite if one wished to risk the instruments which would be destroyed by the sudden falling of the kite The method here given allows the observer to control the time of observation and would seem best on that account The register ing apparatus as shown in Fig 2 iS practically Professor Wilds sys tem with some important differences however I was for a long time troubled about the means of moving the registrationpaper without clockwork but Wilds method ansnvers the purpose very well It must be borne in mind that only a very general descriptiors of the apparatus is given here The following apparatus is to be placed in the basket suspended from the lower end of the balloon The basket must be so ar ranged that the air will have free passage through it when the bal loon is ascending or descending The balloon need only be large enough to carry a few pounds fifty to the height of half a mile it is impossible to foretell just how much the whole apparatus would weigh A hair hygrometer could also be added to the instrumentsy but has not been put in the accompanying sketch The careening of the balloon would have no effect on the work ing of the apparatus as shown here because nothing of the regis tration arrangement is free to move except the pointers In making an apparatus the best arrangement would be somewhat different from the sketch given here The main advantage of this apparatus is the cheapness with which an ordinary aneroid barometer and metal thermometer could be applied to the purpose In Fig 2 R is a stand on which the long

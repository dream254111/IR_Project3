the latter being the form in which the rule as to partners as de fendants is usually expressed If every judgment in Virginia docketed only in the initialed surname of the defendant instead of the Christian name is to be regarded as undocketed as the Court declares the situation is indeed a serious one and calls for prompt legislative intervention The probabilities are that more than onehalf of the judgments and decrees standing today on the records of the Virginia courts do not indicate the Christian names of the defendants but the ini tials only If the Appellate Court means to cure the members of the bar of a bad habit as one might well wish it should hold them only for future conduct after full notice Perhaps this ju dicial outgiving may serve as such notice W M LILE INTERESTINTEREST AS DAMAGES FOR NONPAYMENT OF IN TEREST DUE BY CONTRACTThe rule early established in Vir ginia 1 and lately reaffirmed in the case of Blanchard v Dominion National Bank 2 is that where by the terms of a contract interest falls due at a fixed date and remains unpaid there can be no re covery of interest by way of damages for such nonpayment3 The decisions which establish this rule in Virginia do so arbitrarily No sound basis for the holding is given and we believe that there is none Interest upon interest is called compound interest Compound interest is not favored in the law and so isnot generally recovera ble The disallowance proceeds not upon the ground of usury but from motives of public policy because of its harsh and oppressive character It is not usury unless it exceeds the legal rate but it tends toward usury4 Though this is a well established principle it admits of several equally well establshed exceptions The better opinions refuse to enforce the rule when the reason for it disappears The ques tion as confined to the instant case comes down to this Is it op pressive does it tend toward usury to allow simple interest by way of damages for nonpayment of interest when due Clearly the answer is No When an installment of interest falls due it becomes a simple debt And it is axiomatic that justice de 1 Fultz  Davis 26 Gratt 903 1875 See Childers v Deane 4 Rand 406 1826 2 108 S E 649 1921 3 Whether an agreement between the parties to pay such interest would alter the rule has never been finally settled in this State though dicta can be found indicating that under certain circumstances such an agreement would be held enforceable See Blanchard v Dominion Natl Bank supra  HALE ON DAMAGES p 263 388VIRGINIA SECTION mands payment for the retention and use of the funds of another In a leading case on the subject the court said Call it interest rent or hire it becomes a debt at the time the party promised to pay it and from that time he is using the money of the creditor or the landlord or the bailor and ought to pay for it unless he be allowed to take advantage of his own wrong in not making payment at the day 5 Does not interest bear the same relation to the principal loaned as the hire for a horse bears to the horse Who would contend that a liveryman is not entitled to interest upon such hire if pay ment is not made when due Is it oppressive or is it simply just to award it Interest has been awarded upon defaulted install ments of the hire of slaves6 And the decision seems irreproacha ble How distinguish this from the hire of money Nor is it strictly accurate to say that simple interest by way of damages for nonpayment of interest is compound interest It is interest upon a debt past due Only if the interest due as damages were itself made to bear interest could it be said that compound interest was awarded It is safe to say that this would never be done The rule established by the better decisions and the sounder reasoning may be thus summed up Interest on the principal bears simple interest from the time it falls due until it is paid But in no case can any part of the interest upon interest be made to bear interest7 The different view maintained in Virginia not only avoids harsh ness to the debtor but goes the length of oppressing the creditor J E R THE EXISTENCE OF A LEGAL REMEDY NO LONGER A BAR TO IN JUNCTION OF ILLEGAL TAXESPrior to the year 1916 the law of Virginia as fixed by a long line of decisions was to the effect that a court of equity had concurrent jurisdiction with a court of law over the question of illegal tax assessments1 The fact that an adequate remedy at law was available to the taxpayer was held no bar to injunctive relief2 Naturally it became a frequent occur rence for the validity of an assessment to be tried in the equity courts in proceedings for an injunction And this was true even where the plaintiff had he paid the tax and gone into a court of law might have had complete justice done him there3 8 Bledsoe v Nixon 69 N C 89 12 Am Rep 642 1873  Hoyle v Jones 35 Ga 40 89 Am Dec 273 1866 A Anketel v Converse 17 Ohio St 11 91 Am Dec 115 1866 Goddin  Crump 8

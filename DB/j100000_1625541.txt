astronomer dividing his work among the several observatories in a spirit of helpful co6peration and assigning the labor of computation to those who are fitted thus to follow the lead of others What better service can we do for the Uni versity student than to set before him some of the problems in mathematical or physical chemistry that require patient toil and give him the pleasure of assisting in their solu tion by the use of logarithms and squares What is more practical than to utilize any service he can render  In conclusion I beg leave to suggest the appointment of a joint committee repre senting Sections A B and C of the Ameri can Association to consider the feasibility of striving towards the following ends 1 The compilation of all reliable data of physical chemistry in convenient form for reference distinguishing those determined directly from those calculated indirectly 2 The calculation of empirical formulas to combine any series of data when some better form of generalization is not already at hand 3 The preparation and use of rational formulas wherever possible to deduce the natural constants from series of observa tions and to express the conditions that may be expected to hold between observa tions of different kinds 4 The organization of a band of volun teer compilers and computers from among advanced students who with the counsel and aid of their instructors may assist in the work of compiling data and computing formulas j While the time did not seem ripe for the appointment of such committee at the late meeting of the A A A S the writer would be pleased to receive any further suggestions from those interested regard ing the points noted above ROBT B WARDER HOWARD UNIVERSITY WASHINGTON D C REMARKS ON SOME RECENT FUNGI EXSIC CA TI IT is still a favorite mode among mycolo gists to distribute exsiccati or series of specimens of fungi collected from time to time by various persons and in different lo calities In times past these exsiccati have served a very useful end in enabling collec tors to acquaint students with any new dis coveries and it has not been unusual to find many new species described in them Even at the present day this habit prevails to a greater or less extent and diagnoses of new species frequently occur in these collections In the writers mind however the custom although sanctioned by long usage is rep rehensibleespecially in those cases in which the species are not also described in some botanical journal At a period when such journals were few and when their circula tion was limited the distribution of exsic cati with these new species was justifiable but now with the great increase in means of publication and the facilities for illus tration the necessity for this has passed away It is indeed questionable whether such species can be regarded as published in the strict sense of the word Exsiccati are from their very nature ephemeral They are easily destroyed by insects and other pests They have no place on the shelves of the library They are very lim ited in their circulation and their limited numbers and relatively high price practi cally place them beyond the reach of the majority of students Only a small num ber of persons therefore have access to them and they must be sought for in the larger herbaria of the country The ma jority of botanists are therefore seldom cog nizant of the new species described in 654 SCIENCESCIENCE these exsiccati In many cases the speci mens are distributed in the general herba rium as fast as they are received and un less some record be kept of the new species they are soon lost to view in the great mass of specimens in the herbarium The dupli cation of names has been a frequent result of this practice and it is greatly to be de sired that it cease Let new species be de scribed in regular standard publications so that the majority rather than the minority of students will know of them Among the older distributions is that of Sydow Uredinece This has now reached Fascicle XIX Nos 901950 In this the genus Puccinia is the best represented no less than 25 out of the 50 specimens be longing to it Among them we note P simplex Korn Eriks  Hen which is a duplication of P simplex Peck 1881 34th Ann Rept N Y State Mus Nat Hist p 45 The old plan of writing the labels in stead of printing them is pursued to the great detriment of the appearance of the specimens and to the annoyance of those who attempt to decipher the names We would recommend that a change be made in this regard The newer distribution of Jaczewski Komarov and Tranzschel Fungi Rossice has reached its second fascicle Nos 51100 It is interesting in that it contains many specimens from little known or explored regions of eastern Russia and of Siberia The specimens are neatly put up and have well printed labels Fascicle No IX of Seymour  Earles Economic Fungi bears date of July 1 1895 and consists of Nos 401 to 450 It is made up of parasites on garden vegetables and fruit trees and does not contain any special novelties unless it be the new hosts of Plas modiophora brassicce lately recorded by Hal sted Bull Torr Bot Club XXI 761894 The latest arrivals are Fascicles IX and X of Fungi Parasitici Scandinavici by 655 Eriksson These come from the interest ing region of northern Europe They are accompanied by an index to the ten fascicles in which are given the names numbers and hosts of all the speci mens distributed Fascicle IX Nos 401 450 is devoted entirely to the Uredinese all but two being species of Puccinia P graminis is represented by 19 specimens several being given form names Two new species are described viz P pygmncea and P milii Fascicle X Nos 451500 is also largely devoted to Uredineae although some other orders are represented Three new species are described As it is be lieved that a useful purpose will be served by the publication of these descriptions they are given below from the original labels

of the Ameri can Society of Naturalists Dec 1894 a committee was appointed to consider Dr H H Fields plans for bibliographical re form the committee to report in print That committee would report as follows Dr H H Field in view of the well known imperfections and shortcomings of all existing records of zoological literature has formulated plans which will give the zoological world an approximately complete index of all current literature as promptly as possible This record will be issued in the form of bulletins each number of which will be distributed as soon as sufficient material has been accumulated to make a signature The same bulletin will also be issued printed only on one side of the page to allow for cutting up for special bibliographies Lastly the separate titles N S VOL II No 46 will be issued upon cards of the standard index size Each title will be followed by a few words giving the subject and scope of the article when this is not sufficiently indicated by the title while the cards will have in addition catch numbers so that any library assistant can readily incorporate them in the card catalogue The plan contemplates a union of exist ing bibliographies with this one In the case of the Naples Jahresbericht this will be brought about by cooperation the Naples series continuing practically as the yearly morphological analysis of the Bibliography It is to be hoped that the Zoological Record will consent to cooperate in a simi lar way devoting itself to the systematic side and by aid of the new facilities of co 6peration increase its present usefulness to students Arrangements have now pro gressed so far that it seems probable that the records of literature in the Zoologischer and Anatomischer Anzeigers will be merged in the new scheme and it is hoped that the one in Archiv fur Naturgeschichte will take the same course If sufficient encourage ment be given it is proposed to include physiology in the scope of the new plan The net gain will be fewer bibliographies wider scope nearer approximation to com pleteness and more prompt publication The central office of the work will be es tablished at Zirich Switzerland and it may be said that the cantonal government has already appropriated 2000 francs an nually to its support and will supply suit able quarters for its work France has promised a similar sum and aid is expected from Germany from the International Congress of ZoSlogists and from the British Association for the Advancement of Science Committees have been appointed in France Germany and Russia to co6perate in mak ing the record as complete as possible Lastly publishers stand ready to undertake the publication of the bulletins cards etc

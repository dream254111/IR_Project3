j100056,American Fern Journal,1544282,Other Records of Salvinia natans in the United States,i269020,AMERICAN FERN JOURNAL dried material may be seen on the upper side of the leaf In S natans the leaves are elliptical the trich omes borne on low papillae and the veins imbedded in the tissues of the leaf and very obscure The variety Olfersiana differs from typical S auriculata in having smaller and much thinner leaves in dried material they are rather thick and fleshy in the living plant with only 1530 lateral veins on each side and in the much greater hairiness of all the submerged parts including the sporocarps It is possibly a distinct species and is so treated by Britton in the Flora of Bermuda where there is an excellent figure which might easily have been drawn from the plant now growing at the University of Minnesota Both S auriculata and the variety are natives of tropical America and there is no evidence that either of them will survive a northern winter in the open Thus it becomes even more improbable that the sup posed Minnesota plant is really a native of this state or has ever lived there outside of greenhouses except possibly as a brieflived escape during the summer UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA OTHER RECORDS OF SALVINIA NATANS IN THE UNITED STATESBesides Minnesota three other localities for Salvinia natans are given in current manuals Some account of them may be of interest as a supplement to Professor Butterss note The earliest report of the species is in Purshs Flora of North America where it is said to have been found floating like Lemna on the surface of stagnant waters in several of the small lakes in the western part of New York No subsequent botanist has been able to find the plant in this region we must conclude either that it did not become permanently established or that it 50RECORDS OF SALVINIA NATANS is one of several very dubious records which Pursh by no means the most accurate of botanists admitted into his flora and which are now generally believed to be without foundation of fact A second New York locality is on Staten Island In regard to this Mr William T Davis of New Brighton in response to a request for information very kindly writes as follows The socalled Salvinia natans  was first reported by Mr Thomas Craig from a pond near the Moravian cemetery where he and I collected speci mens and where it was evidently planted along with a number of other aquatic plants Mr Craig also found it in Silver Lake which has since become a reservoir Under the heading Salvinia natans on Staten Island Mr Craig gave an account of his discovery of the plant in the Proceedings of the Natural Science Association of Staten Island for October 14 1893   At a later date I find that I made the following notes in my journal Sunday April 3 1899 I planted Salvinia natans in Ketchems Mill Pond as I did last spring I have not been able to find that any planted last year lived over winter September 23 1899 Saturday In the spring I planted some Salvinia natans in Ketchums Mill Pond and now there are count less numbers of fine plants This Salvinia did not survive the winter and the specimens reported by Mr Craig were doubtless like mine planted shortly before he collected them It is not surprising that the Staten Island Salvinia though growing vigorously for a short time could not be made to live through a winter for specimens of it which I have had the privilege of examining at the New York Botanical Garden and at the Gray Herbarium prove to be like the Minnesota material S auriculata var Olfersiana 51AMERICAN FERN JOURNAL The fourth locality given in the manuals is in Missouri Of this Rev C H Demetrio the original and only collector of the plant there has obligingly furnished the following account Like many other things Salvinia natans was found accidentally After a botanical excursion in the bluffs of the Boisbruli Bottoms of Perry Co Mo wemy friends and Iwere on the homeward way passing Dixons Lake I left the wagon to gather some Azolla caroliniana I took a stick and fished out a bulk of nearly everything I put the bulk in my botanical tin case because I had no time to clean up everything The next day I found besides the A7olla tangled in decaying leaves of Potamogeton and other stuff some plants with sporocarps in the form of little balls I sent a sample to the worldknown Nestor of Botany Prof Dr Asa Gray He pronounced it Salvinia natans   A month after the discovery of Salvinia I got a call from Emma Mo where I arrived December 9 1886 Since that time I have never seen Dixons Lake again I am therefore not able to state whether the Salvinia is growing there indigenous or spontaneous The land is low somewhat swampy and subjected to over flow by the water of the Mississippi River   Mr Demetrios specimen sent to Dr Gray is pre served at Cambridge and is true Salvinia natans Mr B F Bush and Mr E J Palmer who have col lected very extensively in Missouri in recent years state that they have never met with the plant The claim of Salvinia natans to a place in our flora rests then on one ancient and very doubtful report two misidentifications and a single authentic collec tion never repeated at a station which has not been rediscovered in 35 years It surely should not at present be included in our manuals There seems however to be no reason why true S natans might not become naturalized with us as its relative Azolla 52BOTYYCHIUM DISSECTUM A MUTANT 53 caroliniana has become at some places in Europe for it is not like S auriculata a tropical species but one of wide distribution in northern Eurasia where it must needs endure winters as severe as oursC A W IS BOTRYCHIUM DISSECTUM A STERILE MUTANT OF B OBLIQUUMThe question in the title Is Botry chium dissectum a sterile mutant of B obliquum is based on a recent article by C J Chamberlain in the Botanical Gazette 70 387 under the title Grouping and mutation in Botrychium The question is raised in the present instance not with the idea of casting doubt on Prof Chamberlains conclusions but because the problem is one to which readers of the FERN JOURNAL should be able to contribute additional information Will you not look over the following summary of the Chamberlain article for the purpose of comparing its data with your own collecting experience or of making it the basis of special study in the coming season We shall then be glad to hear reports from as many people and places as possible Botrychium is reported as almost invariably growing in groups of individuals not as isolated plants By groups in this case the writer does not mean neces sarily that the plants will be clumped together but that in a patch of thicket where one plant is found others are almost certain to exist Several such woods groups are shown plotted on crosssection paper in Prof Cham berlains article with the location of each individual plant marked and with different marks for different species of Botrychium Of particular importance to the present topic is another observation that B dissectum never occurs except in association with B obliquum and then always in smaller numbers In four plots mainly in different

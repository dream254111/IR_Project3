to type by the competition of the rest of the fauna by which they are surrounded I there were any way of determining approximately the time which has elapsed since the elevationv of the Bahamas above the sea in the Pleistocene epoch we should have a means of determining the rate at which evolution and specific differ entiation may proceed in such an assemblage of pulmonate mollusks placed in a suitable environment and not subjected to serious com petition PreCatnbrtan Rocks of the Ftron7clin Furnace Quadrcbnyle Mr A a SPENCER The view held by Rodgers Cooke and Brit ton that the gneisses of the New Jersey High lands are mainly metamorphosed sediments has not been seriously challenged up to the present time though two of the more recent investigators of tha field Nason in 1890 and Wolff in 1896 have left the way open for accepting an igneous origin for these banded feldspathic rocks Field work in the vicinity of Frallklin Burnace carried on during the summer of 1904 warrants the conclusion that so far as this particular field is concerned the only sediments are the white limestone and a few patches of quartzite the several types of gneiss being undoubtedly igneous and in large part demonstrably intrusive For the purpose of the geologic map five divisions of the pre Cambrian rocks will be recognized 1 the Franklin white limestone 2 a complex of diorites and granites showing more or less gneissic structure 3 blackf hornblende or pyroxene gneiss 4 white granite gneiss and 5 coarse granite or pegmatite Age relations have been established as fol lows The pegmatites cut all the other rocks the white gneiss cuts 2 and 3 the black gneiss cuts 1 and both phases of 2 and finally the granite phase of 2 cuts the lime stone 1 The relation of the diorite phase of 2 to the limestone has not been observed Consanginity in the Eruptive Rocks o f Cripple Creek Mr 1X a GRATON Mr Graton showed that three magmatic groups may be distinguished of which the most important is the series of rocks from the Cripple Creek volcano All the rocks of this group possess certain characteristics in com mon and are of particular interest in having a constant ratio o siTica to alumina a proo of their derivation from a single magma By making certain assumptions based on the field observations the relative volumes of these rocks were computed and by that means an analysis was obtained which was considered to approximate the composition of the total product from the magma reservoir i e the average rock of the Cripple Creek volcano The Big Stnk on the Lucin Route clcross

AND CORREXPONDENCE A NEMATODE DISEASE OF GRASSES IN Europe there have been known for many years certain diseases of grasses including wheat caused by nematodes which penetrate in the larval state the ovaries of the flowers and there reach maturity and lay their eggs The resulting larva reach a certain degree of development and then with the drying up of392 SCIENCE N S VOL XN1 S O DT3  the host plant coil up and dry out themselves In this driedout condition they may remain motionless hut alive for years On falling to the ground the affected seeds absorb mois ture and the worms uncoil bore their way out to freedom and finding new grass plants enter them and ascend to the flower thus completing the circle of development The aSected seeds are usually shorter some times however much longer than the normal seeds and are incapable of germination The glumes are much enlarged and the spikelets stand out at a dierent angle from and are often more crowded on the asis In fact the affected plants may appear to be specifically distinct and one case is known in America where a diseased plant was actually described as a new species the presence of the nematodes having escaped the notice of the investigator Although known in Burope for a long time practically no attention has been paid to this type of nematode disease in America On behalf of the Bureau of Plant Industry of the U S Department of Agriculture the writer has resumed his work interrupted four years ago on the nematode diseases of plants He has found the disease in question in grasses from Texas Oregon and Alaska in the genera Chagtochtocl Agropyron Etyrnus Catarna grostis and Trtseturn Two possibly three species of nematodes were found all belonging to the genus Tyle1wokus Cultural experi ments are now under way to determine if possible whether any of them are identical with T tritict of wheatin Europe In the meantime the writer would be very glad to receive all specimens of grasses and other plants suspected of harboring nematodes in their parts above ground as he wishes to de termine what plants are aSected and which species of nematodes cause the diseases ERNST A BESSEY U S DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE SPEClAL ARTI CLES THE OLYMPIC PENINSULA OF WASHINGTON A VISIT OF five weeks in western Washington in 1902 gave opportunity for the following notes on a region as yet almost unexplored The Olympic Peninsula forms the estreme llorthwest corner of the United States and as may be seen from any map is almost cut of by water on every side The clisnate is mild temperatures ranging at sea level from 22  in winter to 86 F in summer The annual precipitation amounts to 120 inches at Neah Bay Rain falls gently and is to be expected for ten months of the year In July and August there is usually no rain at all so that the forest litter becomes very dry and serious fires sometimes occur Snow is only ocea sional at sea level but at high elevations all of the precipitation is in the form of snow The peninsula is mostly occupied by the Olympic Mountains an irregular group ladi ating out from Xt Olympus 8150 feet Many other peaks rise from 7000 to 8000 feet and large areas lie above 6000 feet As the whole tract is only sixty miles wide from east to west and one hundred miles long the hills and valleys are extremely rugged and precipitous  Glaciers and snoxvfields are numerous in the central parts of the moun tains 2 Dodwell and Rixon Persons some times speak of the Olympids as volcanic but we saw no sign of volcanism either in the rocks or in the pebbles of the Quiniault or Queets rivers Along the coast a soft green marly Cretaceous sandstone lies in gentle folds each crest jutting out to sea as a steep headland 150 to 500 feet high Rivers occupy the synclines In the sandstone luany fossils are found Especially noticeable were stumps logs and fragments of wood at dif3erent levels and in various stages of transition to lignite Capping this stratum is a layer of recent yel low gravel varying from ten to forty feet in thickness and also enclosing logs and stumps Below Point Granville the beach is loxv and sandy but north of this steep cliffs risel di rectly from high water line At various points Copalis ISlaylock Creek government inspectors have found indications of petro leum but no other valuable minerals are known The vegetation of the Olympic Peninsula is truly remarkable Below 5000 feet is the great northwestern forest which must be seen to be appreciated Douglas fir tideland spruce and  red cedar 2 Thuja pticata reach

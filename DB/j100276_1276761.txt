j100276,Michigan Law Review,1276761,Contracts Void as Stifling Competition,i254541,MICHIGAN LAW REVlEW for or upon the sale of any interest in real estate shall be void unless the same or some memorandum thereof be in writing Defendant gave plaintiff a promissory note for the amount stated upon which note action was brought Held the note was an enforceable promise the consideration therefor being the moral obligation upon defendant to pay plaintiff his commission Bagaef v Prokopik I920 212 Mich 265 Under the influence of Lord Mansfield who was obviously impatient with the common law doctrine of consideration see for example Pillans v Van Mierop 3 Burr 1663 there was a marked movement about the middle of the eighteenth century to recognize moral obligation a species of past consideration as sufficient consideration to support a promise See Watson v Turner Bullers N P 129 Atkins v Hill Cowp 284 Barnes v Hedley 2 Taunt I84 Lee v Muggeridge 5 Taunt 36 Not long after Lord Mansfields death serious questions were raised as to how far moral consideration should be recognized In a learned note to Wennal v Adney 3 B  P 249 I804 the cases were examined and the following stated as the proper rule An express promise therefore as it should seem can only revive a precedent good consideration which might have been enforced at law through the medium of an implied promise had it not been suspended by some positive rule of law but can give no original right of action if the obligation on which it is founded never could have been enforced at law though not barred by any legal maxim or statute provision In 1831 in Littlefield v Shee 2 B  Ad S11 Lord Tenterden expressed doubts as to the Mansfield doctrine and in Eastwood v Kenyon II Ad  El 438 I840 the above quoted rule from the note to Wennal v Adney was approved This is the English view today See WILLISTON ON CONTRACTS  I47 LEAKE ON CONTRACTS 6th ed 443 In truth it would seem as said by Parker C J in Mills v Wyman 3 Pick 207 that wherever a man has deliberately made a promise he is morally obligated to perform In general the Amer ican courts follow about the same rule as applied in Eastwood v Kenyon See for example Mills v Wyman supra Lyell v Walbach 113 Md 524 33 L R A N S 741 However in a few jurisdictions there apparently is a disposition to adhere to the broader view of Lord Mansfield See Davis v Morgan Io7 Ga 504 applying a statute Sutchs Estate 201 Pa 305 The principal case indicates that in Michigan that view is well received particularly since contracts not complying with the statute there involved are treated as really void Scott v Bush 26 Mich 418 CONTRACTSVOID AS STIFLING COMPETITIONPlaintiff and defendant attended a British government auction and to avoid competition an agree ment was made for defendant to bid on their joint account and that what ever he purchased should be divided equally each paying onehalf the pur chase money After the sale defendant repudiated the contract Held the agreement is unenforceable as being against public policy at all events where the goods so sold are the property of the public Rawlings v General Trading Co I920 3 K B 30 650RECENT IMPORTANT DECISIONS WILLISTON ON CONTRACTS Vol III Sec 1663 states that in cases of this type the United States authorities regard the contract as void while in Eng land the contrary view is held The court in the principal case in referring to the former English decisions states that equity has taken a different view than the common law discussing In re Carews Estate 26 Beav 187 in which a sale by the court was not set aside although the two bidders agreed not to bid against each other but that one should bid up to I500 and divide the lot between them They bought it for 650 and the court held that this agreement furnished no ground for opening the bidding or annulling the sale as there was no fraud for the reserved price was put at 6oo In Galton v Emus I Coll 243 the vice chancellor held that an agreement between two persons who are desirous of purchasing an estate advertised for sale by auction that one of them shall not bid against the other is not illegal In Levi v Levi 6 Car  P 239 cited to support the principal case the jury were directed that an agreement between brokers for stifling competition was an indictable conspiracy In the United States the courts have disposed of this problem much more effectively 20 L R A 545 note In Doolin v Ward 6 Johns Rep I94 the Supreme Court of New York decided that such an agreement was void and against public policy as tending injuriously to affect the character and value of sales at auction The point was decided similarly in Ralphsnyder v Shaw 45 W Va 680 The case of Phippen v Stickney 3 Met Mass 384 points out the true principle by ruling that an agreement by two or more persons that one of them only will bid at an auction of property and will become the purchaser for the benefit of them all is illegal if it is made for the purpose of preventing competition at the bidding and depressing the price of the property below the fair market value Otherwise if the purpose of the agreement be to enable each of the parties to become a purchaser when he desires a part of the property offered for sale and not the whole lot or if the agreement be made for any other honest and reasonable purpose The test as applied in Fisher v Transpor tation Co 136 Mich 218 is that where the circumstances show that the consideration for the promise is in whole or in part an attempt to prevent competition at a public sale the contract is void and it would seem as though its application would effectually support the conclusion of the Eng lish court and point out the distinction in the cases discussed CRIMINAL LAWPOSTDATED CHECKS WITHOUT FUNDSA statute pro vided that the issuance of a check or draft on any bank without authority when there were insufficient funds to cover the same should be punishable by fine D issued a postdated check without authority or funds and was prosecuted under the statute Held the statute was not applicable to the execution of a postdated check Smith v State Ark I92I 226 S W 531 The only question in the case was whether a postdated check came within the provision check or draft The word check has generally been held to mean drafts payable presently upon a bank while the word draft includes instruments payable at a future date Thus it would seem

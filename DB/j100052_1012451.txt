Company I9I1 As the name implies this is a manual giving in briefest terms information on all subjects likely to be of interest to the agriculturist Would you learn the number of plants set one inch apart it takes to fill an acre or the grading of roses or stock just look in the book and see The wide sale of the three earlier editions is the best indication of its value Barker D A Cash and Credit Pp vi I43 Price 40 cents New York G P Putnams Sons In this day of cheap primers on scientific subjectscheap in quality but not in price when one considers their real valueit is a pleasure to find a primer like this one of Mr Barkers which is accurate and substantial in its exposition of principles and evinces a knowledge of the workaday world in its explanation of their application The book discusses such subjects as the relation of money credit and confidence to prices the theory and practice of the domestic and foreign exchangesa subject upon which the book is particularly strong and the principles and practice of banking Illustrations and descriptive material have reference principally to the Brit ish money market The book is open to a few criticisms but most of them are not serious In his treatment of the price equation pp I920 Mr Barker omits any reference to the important subject of the rates of monetary and of deposit turnover his explanation of the gold exchange standard is onesided being based especially upon the practice in India which differs very materially from the typical gold exchange standard There are minor inaccuracies in the reference to the Philippines p 86 that to Mexico p 87 and that to the United States p I23 All in all however Mr Barkers book is an excellent primer and well worth reading by any one who desires a brief but substantial survey of the principles of money and credit as exemplified in the British money market Beard C A and Schultz B E Documents on the Statewide Initiative Referendum and Recall Pp viii 394 Price 2oo New York Mac millan Company 1912 This is an excellent collection of source material The volume includes all of the constitutional amendments providing for a statewide system of initiative referendum or recall now in force several of the most significant statutes elaborating constitutional provisions all of the constitutional amend ments now pending adoption six important judicial decisions certain materials relative to statewide recall and some illustrative papers showing the system 317The Annals of the American Academy in ordinary municipalities and commissiongoverned cities In the appendix is the complete scheme of government suggested by Hon W S URen and others of Oregon and also the ballot titles for the Oregon election of I9I0 In order that students of government may have accessible the source materials needed for the study of these movements the compilers have promised to issue new additions from time to time as important constitutional amendments or statutes are enacted In the introductory note of sixtynine pages Professor Beard gives the history of the adoption of these measures showing that they are subjects of great practical consideration for all students of government and men of affairs He analyzes succinctly and comments favorably upon the significance of each of the movements The volume is well indexed As a collection of documentary material it has the rare merit of being exhaustive It is a valuable and timely book of reference Bergson Henri Creative Evolution Pp xv 407 Price 250 New York Henry Holt  Co I9II The title of this book attracts attention and this attention is held by the style of the author even though this is a translation Professor Bergson is one of the most known of present French philosophers and there are many who will welcome this English version In essence the author believes that the human mind is bound to attempt a philosophy of the universe that shall utilize the newer discoveries of the ways of natures Science must interpret the changes of matter in order that it may control matter Philosophy must go further back M Bergson at the outset specially emphasizes the role that the concept of duration time now plays and must play in science Indeed this part of his discussion is perhaps the most valuable contribution he makes Neither mechanism which is so characteristic of science nor finality dominant in the older philosophy can now be accepted as satisfactory In their places the author seeks refuge in a vague conception of some vital force which works in creative fashion time being as essential a feature as form The development of modern sciences particularly the biological is dis cussed and then the various systems of philosophy are reviewed The dis cussion is always interesting the criticism often searching In the reviewers opinion there is no good reason for accepting the by no means infrequent dogmatic utterances on vexed questions as final but the argument as a whole will repay careful study

I24 Price 60 cents Boston Houghton Mifflin Company I9II The school prepares in a measure for life but the specialization of modern 318Book Department industry has placed before the average student such a bewildering maze of choices that some effort must be made to direct the youth into the most desirable forms of employment Hence Mr Bloomfield and those working with him have organized vocational guidance bureaus both in the schools and in connection with social agencies outside of the schools As a result of this activity common action has become more easy social insight and the will to serve have increased In clear readable form the author has explained the system of vocational guidance detailing its advantages to the child and the society at large Campbell G L Industrial Accidents and their Compensation Pp xii I05 Price Ioo Boston Houghton Mifflin Company I9II In an essay covering slightly less than one hundred pages the author has attempted to sum up the problem of accident compensation The first por tion dealing with the statistics of industrial accidents and their social causes is notably incomplete in its failure to discriminate between the superficial work done by the average State Labor Bureau and such excellent studies of Industrial Accidents as those made by Miss Crystal Eastman in Pitts burgh and the Minnesota Bureau of Labor in I9o8 The author is either ignorant of or else he fails to recognize the incompetency which frequently shows itself in factory inspection and labor statistics departments The remainder of the work which deals with accident compensation includes a discussion of voluntary agencies of Employers Liability Laws in the United States and of Employers Liability Insurance The book ends with a chapter on Suggested Reforms Not only has the author failed to grasp the full social significance of the accident problem but his citation of remedies is distinctly below the standard of similar work done by Miss Eastman for the Pittsburgh Survey or for the New York Commission on Employers Liability Clark Sue A and Wyatt Edith Making Both Ends Meet Pp xiii 270 Price I50 New York Macmillan Company I9II Making Both Ends Meet consists in large part of the economic records of selfsupporting women living away from home in New York The data were collected through the National Consumers League Mrs Sue A Clark conducted the inquiry for a year and a half obtaining the workers budgets as they were available from young women who were interviewed in their rooms boardingplaces and hotels as well as at nightschools and clubs Edith Wyatt supplemented these accounts and rearranged them The book is not entirely the work of these two however and recognition is given of the help of the other contributors The unstandardized conditions in the work of women generally really form the chief topic of the book Trade legislation backed by conscientious inspection and powerful enforcement is concluded to be the most effectual method of reform The method of presenting the material is extremely interesting usually following the narrative form In short it is well worth the perusal of any 319The Annals of the American Academy one desiring information on the subject without the laborious task of wading through statistics Clay A Syndicalism and Labor Pp xv 230 Price 225 New York E P Dutton  Co I9I1 This work is a polemic against the radicalism so prominent in the labor movement of today Beginning with a discussion of the origin and meaning of the term syndicalism and of the place of syndicalism as a weapon of industrial warfare the author traces the development of the movement in France Italy Spain and the United Kingdom Interest centers of course in the last named country and the main purpose of the volume seems to be that of arousing public attention to the danger of allowing the trade unions and the movement for social reform to become pawns in the game of furthering socialistic designs The trade unions seem to be abandoning the old policy of conciliation and collective bargaining for a policy of class struggle and class aggrandizement The new unionism is merely collectivism under another name and social reform has become a label for a variety of schemes out of which the state socialists make much political capital This has been inevitable in the march of progress but it has led the country to a position in which political and social conditions combine to menace the stability of the system of social organization under whose aegis that progress has been made The middle classes should pause to consider the state to which humane sentiment is leading them They must be brought to realize their situation and to take an attitude that will not be misinterpreted as an encouragement to those who advocate violence and intimidation as the most effectual method of securing the redistribution of wealth Bias marks the whole treatment The author seems to have a morbid eye for anything that can be labelled socialistic and he assumes a sort of divine monopoly over progressive tendencies on the part of the middle classes But for all that the working out of the argument is so intelligent that it cannot be dismissed in cavalier fashion Crampton H E The Doctrine of EvolutionIts Basis and Scope Pp 3I2 Price I5o New York Columbia University Press I9II This book was not written for students of social science but for students of biology Nevertheless it is the best book yet published for those who wish to see what biology has to offer as a basis of or supplement to social studies The author avoids the technical terminology that makes scientific books so difficult He has a unique power of keeping in view the essential principles and of pointing out their application to related subjects The first half treats of evolution as a process It is the sort of biology that every one should know The latter half treats of man and his social evolution This is of course the difficult part but the work has been done so successfully that all can learn from it and few will be inclined to find fault If he occasionally overstates the influence of the biologic factors in social evolution the cor rectives are readily at hand for the economist and sociologist to supplement this view with their own No one interested in social science should miss 320Book Department this rare opportunity to broaden his view and gain a better appreciation of the ways of nature Dean M B Municipal Bonds Held Void Pp 122 Price 250 New York By the Author 1911 This work is stated by the author to be a compilation of all cases in the United States holding municipal bonds void or determining their illegality prior to issuance enjoining their issue denying registration or certificate or refusing their validation It is intended for use by owners and dealers in municipal bonds and banks loaning on such securities as collateral as a check against the illegal issues which are at the present time floating around the country like dere licts upon a sea The work is in reality a digest of the various cases coming to the authors attention bearing upon illegal municipal bond issues A feature of the work is three tables giving the names amounts and char acter of the bonds declared illegal or whose issue was enjoined the pur poses for which they were issued and other matters of a kindred nature Der Ling Princess Two Years in the Forbidden City Pp ix 382 Price 200 New York Moffat Yard  Co 1911 Devine Edward T The Spirit of Social Work Pp xi 23I Price Ioo New York Charities Publication Committee 1911 One of the best known social workers in the United States has sought to present in this volume his conception of the spirit of social work In nine addresses dealing with the Conservation of Human Life Housing Woman Suffrage Criminality Poverty and Philanthropy he presents once more his unfaltering belief in men and his firm conviction that a remodeled environ ment will relieve most of the maladjustments from which society now suffers The work which is clear and forceful should appeal to the widening circle of readers who are interesting themselves in the problem of social work Dodd W E Statesmen of the Old South Pp ix 242 Price 150 New York Macmillan Company I9II This little volume the subtitle of which is From Radicalism to Conserva tive Revolt will go far to confirm Professor Dodds right to be called a keen analyst of American history Only three statesmen are dealt with Jefferson Calhoun and Davis though others are necessarily given some attention because of their relation to these Jefferson is presented in a light which will be pleasing to the insurgent of today Not only was he an insurgent in I776 when he proposed but did not effect the democratiza tion of Virginia but such he remained and the same proposition he offered again in I816 He failed because the interests were too strong We can only wish that Professor Dodd had dwelt a little more on Jefferson as President Calhoun was always a nationalist at heart especially when the Presidency seemed within his grasp but he put property interests above nationalism and democracy and the kind of property he championed must 321The Annals of the American Academy look to the states for protection Jefferson Davis was his disciple and much against his will thinks Professor Dodd was driven to revolt in behalf of the interests Edler Friedrich The Dutch Republic and the American Revolution Pp viii 244 Baltimore The Johns Hopkins Press I9II Dr Edler has done an excellent piece of historical research though he would have made his study more valuable had he placed greater emphasis upon its economic and financial aspects And his work would have had more general interest had he put it in a more attractive literary form His purpose was to treat his subject primarily and largely from the diplomatic point of view and with all possible fullness of detail and he has achieved his purpose of making a scientific treatment of a subject slightly known and appreciated in the United States He has considered the many phases of politics in the United Provinces during the period of the American Revolution He has made it unmistak ably clear that the Dutch rendered very important aid to the Americans though in an indirect and clandestine manner and though almost wholly for the sake of Dutch commercial interests The Dutch were at the beginning of the war between England and the American provinces nominally neutral by its end they were openly the allies of the Americans and the enemies of the British Throughout the war they were especially eager to obtain a large share of their trade The agents of the American provinces and of France made use of the United Provinces for many secret negotia tions In many ways the Dutch rendered aid to the Americans and the French though by the terms of the treaty of peace between England and the Americans the Dutch were made the victims Franck H A Four Months Afoot in Spain Pp 370 Price 200 New York Century Company I9II Here is a book that is different from the ordinary book of travel With only 172 to cover all expenses the author goes by steerage to Gibraltar making the trip through Spain on foot and by thirdclass rail He departs from the usual line of travel and visits places unknown to the ordinary tourist His knowledge of the Spanish language and his wonderful adapt ability make it possible for him to mingle with the lower classes as one of them He makes friends with tramps and peasants eating their food and living as they live The book does not attempt to give any great amount of real informa tion It is just an easily flowing and often humorous account of his care free wanderings He gives interesting glimpses of life in Spain especially among the peasantstheir attitude toward church and State Like other travelers the author condemns the profligacy of the priesthood but he sees little to disapprove of in the bull fights Altogether the book is unusual and is delightfully interesting It com pares favorably with the authors earlier work A Vagabonds Journey Around the World 322Book Department Garner James W Government in the United States Pp 416 Price 100 New York American Book Company I9II This is a textbook designed primarily for use in high schools and academies The book happily begins with a discussion of local government From local government it proceeds to discuss in an inclusive manner the machinery first of state then of national government More than the usual amount of attention is devoted to the actual operation of governmental machinery For this reason the book will undoubtedly go far toward meeting the con stantly increasing demand for a text for secondary schools that will emphasize the personal relation existing between the citizen and his govern ment If may be questioned however whether the book goes far enough in this direction To be sure suggestive chapters are devoted to interesting discussions of suffrage and elections political parties and nominating methods citizenship and organization and procedure of Congress but is it not high time that secondary students be taught something as to law creating as well as to lawmaking forces Certainly at least one chapter might have been devoted to the formation and expression of public opinion and the means by which legislative and administrative bodies are actually influenced From the standpoint of pedagogy the book is entirely satisfactory The type is clear the arrangement is excellent the subject matter is well proportioned it is written with clearness of diction At the close of each chapter is a list of references and a list of questions through which the student may be taught the value and use of documentary material The questions will also serve as a point of departure for the discussion of interesting and pressing governmental problems of the day In the appendix are copies of the Articles of Confederation and of the Federal Constitution Garrett G Where the Money Grows Pp ii 66 Price 50 cents New York Harper  Brothers I9II This collection of short sketches descriptive of Wall Street and of the habits of those who frequent it has less value in book form than in the pages of a daily paper for which some of the sketches are very appropriate The two entitled The Way of a Client and Taking Trouble Home are the best Hackwood E W Good Cheer Pp 424 Price 250 New York Sturgis  Walton Company I9II The Romance of Food and Feasting the secondary title of this book gives a much better idea of its contents than its general title A wealth of material gathered from a great variety of sources is presented A few of the thirty seven topics discussed are Culinary Art the Mainspring of Civilization Foods and Culinary Practices of the Ancients Forks and Refinement The Roast Beef of Old England The Cook and his Art National Foods and National Prejudices Influence of Diet on National Character Curiosities of Diet The Aesthetics of the Dinner Table The materials are presented topically and without any semblance of scientific arrangement or logical development It is 323The Annals of the American Academy neither a history nor a scientific treatise and one must search diligently through the chapter analyses to find specific manners and customs of various peoples The index is of no assistance in this pursuit except as to items of food and a few general subjects The student of gastronomy however will find it interesting and entertaining It is rich in quotations without refer ences and is profusely illustrated Hard William The Women of Tomorrow Pp xi 211 Price I5o New York Baker  Taylor Company I9II Among the books which have recently appeared dealing with the question of women and their modern revolt against traditional dependence the present work stands out sharply marked off from the others by its brilliant easy style and its broad grasp of the fundamental principles underlying the woman movement Mr Hard in his present volume has contributed not a little to the available material on one of the most vital modern social problems Herrick C A Reclaiming a Commonwealth and Other Essays Pp viii 20I Price Ioo Philadelphia John J McVey I9II Under the above title Dr Herrick has put forth a volume of essays on educational topics that will command the serious attention of educators and of the thinking public generally Of special interest are the ones on Reclaiming a Commonwealth in which Dr Herrick narrates dramatically the struggle to raise North Carolina from illiteracy and utter lack of educational ideals to a creditable position among American commonwealths on Educa tion the Keystone of Power and Old and New Education wherein are clearly described certain educational ideals and tendencies and on Unconscious Education which discusses in delightful fashion the qualities essential to the true teacher and the rich rewards of the spirit which come to the man who devotes himself unreservedly to the training and development of youth The other essays are of a more practical sort and while adding to the readers storehouse of facts make less contribution to his mental furniture This little volume is an admirable one for the odd minutes that are too precious to be wasted and too few consecutively to be used for more exhaustive discussions Hicks F C Competitive and Monopoly Price Pp 39 Cincinnati Univer sity of Cincinnati I9II The viewpoint of this discussion proceeds from fairly well accepted premises in current theory and its development contains little that is new The con clusion reached seems to be a compromise such as would preserve the valu able elements both in competition and in combination The following is the authors summary of guiding principles I Fair price can be secured only by securing the proper balancing of competition and unity of action No policy can hope for success which regards competition as natural and beneficial in and for itself and unity of action as abnormal and injurious 2 Since under modern industry the healthy balancing of competition and unity of action cannot be attained through the spontaneous working of 324Book Department business interests there must be legislation and this legislation must have for its object not the impossible regime of free competition but the proper adjustment of both competition and unity of action 3 Mere general provisions as to acts that are in restraint of trade are not sufficient The dividing line between acts which in their ultimate effect do and those which do not restrain trade is altogether too indefinite to suit the needs of business The specific evils shown by experience to result from excessive unity of action and from excessive competition should be clearly defined and explicitly forbidden so that both the general public and those who manage industry may know just what is and what is not contrary to law

from the writers own experience It contains a brief sketch of the history of the movement and a discussion of the different problems which the district nurse is likely to encounter It teems with practical and sensible suggestions and will be found of value by all who have to do with this important phase of the movement for public health Jenkins Hester D Ibrahim Pasha Pp I23 New York Longmans

Macmillan Company 1912 Party control of the government the development of party organization in the United States the convention and the direct primary the national conven tion and the election of the President senatorial elections elections to the House of Representatives and to the state legislature party organization the ballot party problems and remedies and direct legislation and the recall are the main headings under which the author has classified his material The nature of the sources of the material will be gleaned from the fact that out of seventytwo readings one is an excerpt from a judicial decision two are excerpts from speeches three from constitutions five from state and federal statutes seven from newspapers nine from pamphlets twentythree from peri odicals and twentyfive from standard books The work is therefore pre eminently a collection of readings It is not a source book For instance out of the eleven readings on party organization but one the Rules of the Republican Party in Pennsylvania may be called real source material It would seem as though the party rules and regulations of at least a few other typical states might well have been given The volume contains no compara tive readings on party organizations and methods in other countries The book is admirably adapted for use in an introductory course in Party Organization and Methods Each reading is prefaced by a clean cogent paragraph succinctly stating the significance of the point at issue The volume will be of inestimable value in all courses that deal with and for all readers who wish to become acquainted with actual party government Jordan David S The Heredity of Richard Roe Pp 165 Price 120 Boston American Unitarian Society I9II Probably no man in America is doing more to popularize and interpret modern biology than the writer the president of Leland Stanford University Using the hypothetical man Richard Roe the author tells of his inheritance from his ancestors inheritances good or bad and the varied problems thereby introduced The little volume will be of great interest to the gentle reader who wants to know something of these vital questions The story is well told and in

Co I9II The reader turns from this book with a feeling that it has been decidedly misnamed Although it is called America of Tomorrow it deals in a very decided sense with America of today as it was seen by a visiting Frenchman The greater portion of the book is concerned with American manners and customs as they relate to educational institutions Aside from a short discussion of the probable results upon American life of the present Japanese problem the author fails entirely to reach Tomorrow 326Book Department Kurella Hans Cesare Lombroso A Modern Man of Science Pp vii I94 Price I5o New York Rebman Company This little volume written shortly after the death of the great criminologist is an attempt to evaluate the work of Lombroso and to describe the position which he occupied in the field of positive social science A concise bio graphical sketch is followed only by such discussion of his theories as is necessary to reveal his leadership in the revolutionizing of criminological science The work is admirably done No attempt is made to gloss over the errors or exaggerations They are frankly acknowledged but are regarded merely as incidental blemishes upon the otherwise great achieve ment of this man of the true scientific spirit In a very interesting appendix on Lombrosos spiritualistic researches the author narrates the circumstances led him into this field of investigations and the methods by which he was deceived and concludes To our enemies we freely give the Lombroso of senile decay for the Lombroso of youth forever young is ours In another appendix he gives a chronological list of Facts and Documents of Positivism I84I1865 The book is excellent reading for all students of Criminology and especially for such as seek an unprejudiced estimate of the work of the founder of the Italian school Lawrence W W Medieval Story and the Beginnings of the Social Ideals of Englishspeaking People Pp xiv 236 Price I50 New York Columbia University Press I9II The English people are a composite of Germanic Scandinavian French and Celtic elements fused in the meltingpot of the British Isles just as similar elements are now combining in the United States Among the methods of approach to an examination of the social ideals of these early peoples none is more suggestive than that of the great stories that grew into form during the medieval period These narratives serve not only as faithful records of the vices ambitions and social ideals of bygone days but picture as well the rise of class distinctions and the contrasting spirits of aristocracy and democracy Beowulf brings out the honor bravery and selfsacrifice of the AngloSaxon the story of Roland reveals the patriotism piety and prowess of the conquering Normans the Arthurian romances picture the magic and mystery and soaring imagination of the Celt The tone of the stories of Arthur is thoroughly aristocratic The note of democracy is struck in the History of Reynard the Fox and in the story of Robin Hood and finally in the Canterbury Tales all classes meet on common ground for the first time since the Norman conquest This reflects a recognition of popular rights by the ruling aristocracy and the rise of a democratic spirit in English life These developments are traced by Professor Lawrence in facile popular vein and the succession of lectures on the different stories makes absorbingly interesting reading Levy H Monopoly and Competition Pp xviii 333 Price 325 New York Macmillan Company I9I1 327The Annals of the American Academy Lincoln J T The Factory Pp xiv o04 Price

Business Pp v 339 Price I25 New York Macmillan Company 191I This book clearly recognizes that human efficiency is based on definite psychological principles The application of these principles is applied to the entire field of business activitynamely the labor of production the salesmen and the manager The treatment is humanizing in that the ideals which should govern any normal working individual are shown to be directly related to the minutiae of everyday working experience The mind qualities of imitation competition loyalty and concentration are discussed in their relation to specific business or labor problems Physical health is analyzed in its relation to human progress Pleasure and relaxation in con nection with our daily efforts are shown to be necessary factors in bring ing about a saner concept of human possibilities An observation of these principles results in scientifically controlled experiences When these experi ences have become habits the efficiency of men in fundamental occupations is shown to be greatly increased The book leaves one with the impression that the sociological worker has here found a psychological basis for cer tain of his institutions while an adjustment between human efficiency and wages tends to note a happy and sane commercial progress Squire Belle The Woman Movement in America Pp viii 286 Price Ioo Chicago A C McClurg  Co I9II The Woman Movement in America by Belle Squire of Chicago is a short account of the struggle for equal suffrage and equal rights beginning with Mary Wollstonecrafts Vindication of the Rights of Woman and tracing the movement down to the vigorous suffrage campaign of today The first few chapters of the book were written primarily for newspaper purposes In welding them with other chapters into book form the author has followed throughout the whole the method of the original chapters The style therefore is rapid graphic pictorial and somewhat inclined to exaggeration A criticism for lack of scientific method would hardly be just since the author so frankly confesses her haste and her purpose The book is calculated to appeal to the rapid casual reader rather than to

volume will be most welcome All these will join in a vote of thanks to Mr Stewart for putting so much of the writings of Mrs Lowell in available form To others it need only be said that Mrs Lowell was one of the finest of the many young women whom the Civil War left a wfdow Born of a noted New England family highly educated married early during the war she soon experienced its horrors in the deaths of her brother and her husband both highly esteemed officers The balance of her life she devoted to the care of her daughter and to social work In the effort to better social conditions Mrs Lowell soon became a leader Her main interests were in charity organization labor questions and civil service reform but there were few social betterment movements in New York City between I865 and 1905 in which she did not actively participate Entirely aside from the personal interest in Mrs Lowell this account of the early stages of recent philanthropic activity will prove of great value The editor of

social science at Yale from 1872 till June I9o9 only a few months before his death An incessant worker fearless outspoken indomitable prince of teach ers are the descriptive terms used by his students In his earlier years financial questions currency tariff were his main interests and his long service as protagonist of the free trade propaganda is well known In later life he bore an active part in developing the newer science of sociology and the process of social evolution supplanted the older interests Though not a voluminous writer preferring as he once said to correct his own mistakes Dr Sumner wrote and wrote well Aside from a few volumes of which The Mores is the most significant in view of his death before his projected magnum opus was far along there are many essays worthy of preservation As a memorial to Dr Sumner his student and colleague Albert G Keller has edited seventeen of these occasional writings with one exception written after I896 Former students will welcome the collection The keen incisive thought makes the essays valuable as a basis of discussion Those who do not know the other work of Professor Sumner have a treat ahead of them if they will dip into this volume Toynbee Gertrude Reminiscences and Letters of Joseph and Arnold Toynbee Pp xi I96 Price 2s 6d London Henry J Glaisher 1911 This little book reveals the characteristic mental attitudes of Joseph Toynbee and his son Arnold The former was a gentle scientist of great personal dignity and sweetness beloved by his family and friends The same mental tone belonged also to his more famous son who seemedto possess in addition a certain charming restlessness indicative of the beginning of the terrific spiritual upheaval chracteristic of the last half century Both father and son held a sympathetic attitude toward the changing religious and socialpolitical point of view They both had at any rate a strong inkling that from life alone can truth spring Forerunners of pragmatism in this respect they have added contemporaneous interest The letters are unduly devoted to the description of scenery from to days taste The letters are indeed homely domestic commonplace Yet shall one call commonplace letters whose implicit trust in life everywhere is indicated The Land Act is a great deal more intelligible to me after looking at peasants holdings and talking to peasants themselves The work Henry Georges book is remarkable as the firstor almost the firstAmerican treatise on an economical subject that reflects American experiences It is the product of a study of Ricardos Theory of Rent and observation of landgrabbing in California Arnold Toynbees view of life as a whole is nowhere better expressed than in his letter to Maitland Hobday in r875 It seemed to me that the primary end of all religion is the faith that the end for which the whole universe of sense and thought from the Milky Way to the lowest form of animal lifethe end for which everything came into existence is that the dim idea of perfect holiness which is found 331The Annals of the American Academy in the mind of man might be realized that this idea is God Eternal and the only reality that the relation between this idea which is God and each individual man is Religionthe consciousness of the relation creating the duty of perfect purity of inner life or being and the duty of living for others that they too may be perfectly pure in thought and action and lastly that the world is so ordered that the triumph of righteousness is not impossible through the efforts of the individual will in relation to Eternal existence This righteousness Toynbee saw could be realized only in fellowship East London became therefore a spiritual necessity to him Indeed the art of fellowship is still the central note of the social settlement White Horace Money and Banking 4th Ed Pp xiv 41 Boston Ginn  Co 1911 Both publisher and author are to be commended for their enterprise in keep ing this really valuable

literally burned the midnight oil to advance himself in knowledge his uncle chided him for thus causing him additional expense In a spirit of perfect obedience the boy submitted but managed by extra work to secure money to pay for the oil Again his uncle remonstrated saying that the money should be turned over to him to lessen the burden of his support Sontoku dutifully acquiesced but by laboring in the small hours of the night still secured enough to educate and fit himself for the great purpose of buying back his ancestral home and thus gratifying the spirits of his ancestors When this pious task was complete a nobler workto restore to prosperity certain poverty stricken villagescaused him to sell and forsake his ancestral home so as to follow the path the spirits of his ancestors would have desired His 332Book Department industry and his sagacity his noble example and scrupulous conformity to the best ideals of the Japanese religion impressed all about him and he was called from greater to ever greater tasks He extended more and more the field of his usefulness His deep religious feeling and strong personality gathered about him a band of disciples one of whom wrote his life of which this little book is the English translation The Japanese original has been circulated by the government Although Sontoku died at the age of seventy his work still lives and his example would seem to be in Japan what Tolstois is to the Russian peasant Besides the beautiful story of the sages simple life the reader will learn much about the real heart and ideals of Japan and will feel his sympathy for the Japanese people quickened Reverence for such a character as Sontoku would alone stamp the Japanese as a noble people REVIEWS Ashley W J British Dominiions Pp xxviii 276 Price I80 New York Longmans Green  Co I9I1 Men of long experience in colonial affairs or in foreign trade contribute to this unusually satisfactory survey of the British possessions No review of politics in the narrower sense nor of forms of government is attempted the main object is to sketch the material development that has been achieved and to point out the extent of present commerce and the possibility of future progress The dominions to which attention is drawn are with the excep tion of the West Indies the great nontropical settlement colonies Australia New Zealand South Africa and Canada The lectures with one exception were delivered during I9I0II under the auspices of the University of Bir mingham The opening discussion by the late Secretary for the Colonies the Right Honorable Alfred Lyttleton gives a general survey of English commercial policy toward the oversea possessions The two lectures on Australia cover much the same groundone from the point of view of the Colonial Admin istrator the other from that of a man engaged extensively in Australian trade Of the two on South Africa one deals with the recent political diffi culties the agricultural development and possibilities the labor problem relations of the Dutch and English and immigration questions the other with the ports transportation facilities and organizations for promoting business The Honorable W P Reeves late High Commissioner of New Zealand gives a graphic account of the development and socioeconomic experiments of that distant colony which though less an essay on commerce than the others is perhaps the most interesting to the majority of readers Of spe cial interest to American students is the essay on the West Indies in which the late Commissioner of Agriculture traces the steps by which those numer ous colonies have been lifted from the condition of impending bankruptcy 333

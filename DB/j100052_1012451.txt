WEAPON OF INDUSTRIAL WARFARE THE AUTHOR TRACES THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MOVEMENT IN FRANCE ITALY SPAIN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM INTEREST CENTERS OF COURSE IN THE LAST NAMED COUNTRY AND THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE VOLUME SEEMS TO BE THAT OF AROUSING PUBLIC ATTENTION TO THE DANGER OF ALLOWING THE TRADE UNIONS AND THE MOVEMENT FOR SOCIAL REFORM TO BECOME PAWNS IN THE GAME OF FURTHERING SOCIALISTIC DESIGNS THE TRADE UNIONS SEEM TO BE ABANDONING THE OLD POLICY OF CONCILIATION AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING FOR A POLICY OF CLASS STRUGGLE AND CLASS AGGRANDIZEMENT THE NEW UNIONISM IS MERELY COLLECTIVISM UNDER ANOTHER NAME AND SOCIAL REFORM HAS BECOME A LABEL FOR A VARIETY OF SCHEMES OUT OF WHICH THE STATE SOCIALISTS MAKE MUCH POLITICAL CAPITAL THIS HAS BEEN INEVITABLE IN THE MARCH OF PROGRESS BUT IT HAS LED THE COUNTRY TO A POSITION IN WHICH POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS COMBINE TO MENACE THE STABILITY OF THE SYSTEM OF SOCIAL ORGANIZATION UNDER WHOSE AEGIS THAT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE THE MIDDLE

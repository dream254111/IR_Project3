VII Conclusion 83 I IT has become the fashion of late to refer to the Marxian interpretation of history as an economic interpretation and to drop the term materialist used by Marx and Engels Indeed one recent writer goes so far as to say that there is no logical connection either way between philosophic materialism and what is called the materialistic conception of history    Economic causes operate through mens desire for pos sessions and would be supreme even if desire could not from a philosophic point of view be explained in materialistic terms 1 Thus this socalled economic interpretation becomes at last a psychological interpre tation Marx and Engels however use the term material ist in describing their theory While the writer be lieves for reasons that will become apparent later that this term describes their view more accurately than the term economic nevertheless it must be conceded 1 Bertrand Russell  Bolshevik Theory New Republic September 15 1920 7273 INTERPRETATION OF HISTORY that it is open to criticism on the ground that it is too broad There are various materialist interpretations of history  geographic climatic and technological The Marxian interpretation however is technological The special theory of Marx can best be set forth by quotations from his writings It is not the articles made but how they are made and by what instruments that enables us to distinguish different historical epochs Instruments of labor not only supply a standard of tle degree of development to which human labor has at tained but they are also indicators of the social condi tions under which that labor is carried on 2 Speaking of the technological comparison of different epochs of production he says However little our written his tories up to this time notice the development of material production which is the basis of all social life and there fore of all real history yet prehistoric times have been classified in accordance with the results not of socalled historical but of materialistic investigation These periods have been divided to correspond with the ma terials from which their implements and weapons are made viz into the stone the bronze and the iron ages 2 From Engels we have the following   the whole of history up to the present time is to be regarded as the history of the period extending from the time of the practical discovery of the transformation of mechanical movement into heat to that of the transformation of heat into mechanical movement 3 Clearly this is technology and not economics Marx it is true does refer to the economic structure of society as the foundation on which rise legal and political superstructures But at the base of the eco nomic structure of society he never allows us to lose 2 Capital Kerr edition vol i p 200 3 Engels Landmarks of Scientific Socialism translated by Lewis Kerr edition pp 148 14974 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS sight of the foundation stones of technology The eco nomic structure is referred to as relations of produc tion the technological foundation underlying the economic structure is referred to as methods of produc tion and material forces of production In the social production which men carry on they enter into definite relations that are indispensable and independent of their will these relations of production constitute the economic structure of society  the real foundation on which rise legal and political superstructures and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness The mode of production in material life determines the general character of the social political and spiritual processes of life  At a certain stage of their de velopment the material forces of production in society come in conflict with the existing relations of production   New higher relations of production never appear before the material conditions of their existence have matured in the womb of society  In broad out lines we can designate the Asiatic the ancient the feudal and the modern bourgeois methods of production as so many epochs in the progress of the economic forma tion of society 4 From these quotations it must be clear that while Marx looks upon the economic structure of society as the basis for the political and intellectual superstructure he finds the foundation upon which the economic structure is built in technology in the mechanical modes of pro duction He distinguishes in short between the eco nomic basis of society and the technological basis of society 4 Marx Critique of Political Economy translation by Stone pp 1113INTERPRETATION OF HISTORY II There are then according to Marx three distinct steps in the social process 1 changes in the technique of production 2 changes in the economic structure of society  in the relations of production the prop erty relations such as free competition freedom of enterprise private property on the one hand or monop oly public regulation public ownership and cooperation on the other 3 changes in political social and intel lectual institutions Changes in technique necessarily alter the economic structure of society which in turn affects government social institutions and the con trolling ideas of the age With Marx then the foundation upon which any society is built is the technique of production and trans portation Industrial society is conditioned by this technique The economic structure of society is the adjustment that human beings in all their economic interrelations have made to the conditions imposed by technology Political interrelations in turn must con form to the economic structure of society So also with other social institutions Thus the superstructure is reared on the basis of the economic structure which in turn rests on the technique of production Man makes his own history but he does not make it out of whole cloth he does not make it out of conditions chosen by himself but out of such as he finds close at hand 5 III Engels statement of the theory differs somewhat from that of Marx but he agrees in his emphasis on the technological basis of society He defines historical materialism as that view of the course of history 5 Marx The Eighteenth Brumaire translated by DeLeon p 9 7576 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS which seeks the ultimate cause and the great moving power of all important historic events in the economic developmlent of society in the changes in the modes of production and exchange in the consequent division of society into distinct classes and in the struggle of these classes against one another 6 From this point of view the final causes of all social changes and political revolu tions are to be sought not in mens brains not in mans better insight into eternal truth and justice but in the changes in the modes of production and exchange  From this it also follows that the means of getting rid of the incongruities that have been brought to light must also be present in a more or less developed condition within the changed modes of production themselves These means are not to be invented by deduction from fundamental principles but are to be discovered in the stubborn facts of the existing system of production 7 Engels statement of the theory may be summarized as follows 1 changes in the modes of production and exchange 2 the consequent formation of new class alignments 3 class conflicts growing out of this new alignment 4 reconstruction of economic social polit ical and intellectual institutions The fundamental difference between the Engels ver sion and the Marxian lies in the emphasis that Engels places on class alignments and class conflicts In his in troduction to the Communist Manifesto he tells us that the whole history of mankind has been a history of class struggles Marx places the matter on a broader basis With him the technical changes in the modes of production necessitate new human and social adjust ments to the changed technological environment True so far as changes in the economic and political institu 6 Engels Socialism Utopian and Scientific Kerr edition p 23 7 Ibid pp 94 95INTERPRETATION OF HISTORY tions of society are concerned such adjustments con stitute an effort on the part of society as a whole to come to terms with the new technological conditions And since any adjustment on the part of society as a whole to new situations involves injury and suffering for some groups and benefit and progress for others the neces sary result is a struggle arising out of opposing class in terests All adjustments involving social interrelations must result in conflict But many adjustments do not involve complex interrelations For example take Marxs discussion of the effect of capitalism on parental exploitation of children Marx tells us that it was the capitalistic mode of exploitation which by sweeping away the economical basis of parental authority made its exercise degenerate into a mischievous misuse of power 8 Clearly the class struggle had no part in the adjustment of family conditions to the factory system of production Another example would be the effect of modern industrialism on Sunday observance and re ligious belief On the other hand Marx points out that a persons intellectual outlook and ideals tho the in dividual himself may be unaware of it are frequently a product of class antagonisms based on a clash of eco nomic interests Upon the several forms of property upon the social conditions of existence a whole super structure is reared of various and peculiarly shaped feel ings illusions habits of thought and conceptions of life The whole class produces and shapes these out of its material foundation and out of the corresponding social conditions The individual units to whom they flow through tradition and education may fancy that they constitute the true reasons for and premises of his conduct 9 8 Capital Kerr edition vol i p 536 9 Marx The Eighteenth Brumaire translated by DeLeon p 48 7778 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS IV Social dynamics then go back ultimately according to Marx and Engels to changes in the modes of production But one may ask what brings about these changes in the modes of production In the Communist Manifesto Marx and Engels sought to explain how changes in the modes of production brought on the downfall of feudal ism What brought on these changes in technique which felled feudalism It was the widening of the market The East Indian and Chinese markets the coloniza tion of America trade with the colonies the increase in the means of exchange and in commodities generally gave to commerce to navigation to industry an impetus never before known    The feudal system of indus try under which industrial production was monopolized by close guilds now no longer sufficed for the growing wants of the new markets The manufacturing system took its place    Meantime the markets kept ever growing the demand ever rising Even manufacturing no longer sufficed Thereupon steam and machinery revolutionized industrial production The place of manufactare was taken by the giant Modern Indus try    This still leaves us hanging in midair What were the factors which brought on the widened market The answer of the Communist Manifesto is The discovery of America the rounding of the Cape   In short the development of the science of navigation And back of this scientific development lies the quest for treasure land and livelihood Engels expressed the causal relation as follows Although technique is mainly dependent on the condition of science it is still more true that science depends on the condition and needs of technique A technical want felt by society is more of an impetus toINTERPRETATION OF HISTORY science than ten universities 10 So Engels solved the riddle by arguing in a circle technique depends on science and science depends on technique By implica tion however one would infer that possibly ten uni versities interested in research for its own sake might contribute something to science independently of the impetus of the needs of technique But of course Marx and Engels did go back to more fundamental ultimates than those so far enumerated They were philosophical materialists They write It is impossible to separate thought from matter that thinks This matter is the substratum of all changes going on in the world From Marx we have the fol lowing I was led by my studies to the conclusion that legal relations as well as forms of state could neither be understood by themselves nor explained by the socalled general progress of the human mind but that they are rooted in the material conditions of life   12 One has only to read Engels Landmarks of Scientific Socialism to realize that he seeks for ulti mate causes in the forces inherent in cosmic evolution Physical evolution is there surveyed in terms of Kants nebular theory organic evolution in terms of Dar winism Why then are changes in the modes of production and exchange referred to as the ultimate cause of historic events Because Marx and Engels are trying to lay bare only the dynamics of human history They are not seeking to discover causal relations in the universe as a whole They are seeking to explain the social proc ess So far as human society goes they conceive that they have reached ultimate fundamentals when they 10 Engels letter of 1894 in Der Sozialistische Akademiker quoted in Seligman Economic Interpretation of History p 59 11 Marx and Engels Die Heilige Familie quoted in Engels Socialism Utopian and Scientific Kerr edition p 16 12 Marx Critique of Political Economy translation by Stone p 11 7980 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS have found the basis upon which social institutions rest For them all social institutions are human adjustments to the prevailing technique of production With the underlying causes for the changes in technique they are in the main not concerned Whatever may be the rea sons for these changes all the institutions of society economic political social intellectualare the results of the efforts of conscious struggling human beings to adjust their social relations to their technical environ ment V The accompanying diagram may help to place the Marxian theory against the broader background of fundamental factors and forces We start with Man and Nature Nature furnishes the natural environment ETERNAL

Science Philosophy Recreational Social customs 13 Cf Woodworth Dynamic PsychologyINTERPRETATION OF HISTORY which acts selectively upon human heredity resulting in races of men equipped with native instincts and capac ities sensations and emotions adapted to the selective environment The natural environment also offers stimuli evoking responses in the native equipment of man This native equipment has survived because it constitutes a workable adjustment to nature Different adjustments might no doubt have been possible but through the trial and error method of nature certain types of human equipments have survived Nature thus affects Man But this is quite a different thing from contending as would philosophical materialism that you can explain Man in terms of Nature It is not necessary to go into detail regarding the causal interrelations of native equipment acquired equipment natural environment and acquired environ ment A little reflection will soon convince one that the causal relation works both ways between any one of them and each of the other three For our purposes it is sufficient to point out that Marx and Engels were con cerned only with an explanation of social institutions and the law of social dynamics As philosophical ma terialists it is true they have always as a background for their thinking the imminent forces of cosmic evolu tion These forces expressing themselves through Man and Nature bring on changes in the technique of pro duction These changes serve as their starting point in explaining history For them there is but one active dynamic institution in society  the technical modes of production All other institutions of society are con ceived as passive They would never change were it not for changes in the modes of production An analogy may be found in Fishers equation of exchange Fisher conceives of M and T as active dynamic factors V M V and P are passive factors which change as M or T changes 8182 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS VI Enough has been said to show the severe limitations of the Marxian theory They may be summarized as follows 1 The theory starts with changes in the technological processes It does not reach back to the ultimate forces in life the drives inherent in the native instincts and capacities sensations and emotions in the acquired equipment of man and the stimuli afforded by the natural environment Here are to be sought the real wellsprings of individual and social life 2 The theory assumes that the one external condi tion to which man must make new adaptations in his social institutions is the technique of production The assumption is not true Changes in the natural environ ment in climate and geography for example profoundly alter the face of civilization as Huntington has so ably shown No doubt these changes work out their influ ence to a considerable extent through resulting changes in the modes of production but not exclusively so 3 The theory assumes that if no changes took place in the modes of production social institutions would not change The mere statenlent of this view of history shows how extremely mechanical it is It completely overlooks the instinct of contrivance and invention the constant effort of human beings through trial and error to find improved adaptations to their environment Even tho mans environment never changed social in stitutions would still change because of mans constant effort to find better adaptations to that environment 4 The theory assumes that all social institutions are adaptations to external environment It overlooks the fact that social institutions are also adaptations to the instincts capacities and emotions inherent in man himINTERPRETATION OF HISTORY self Hence even tho no changes took place in the modes of production man would still seek to contrive superior forms of selfexpression Changes would thus take place especially in religious intellectual and rec reational institutions 5 The theory assumes that but one single adaptation to given conditions is possible In the social produc tion which men carry on they enter into definite rela tions that are indispensable and independent of their will Hence the dogma of the inevitableness of social ism But in reality the whole history of man is an ap plication of the method of trial and error The very fact that we are constantly trying out various solutions none of which are perfect indicates that there is no one single solution VII Human beings are phlegmatic Tradition and inertia are strong Social institutions change slowly for the simple reason that any change must get the support of the existing dominant social forces or else the balance of power must be shifted Hence as a rule social institu tions are not changed until some powerful force comes along to pry them loose The Marxian theory is a bril liant recognition of this fact In modern times at any rate technological changes are taking place with aston ishing rapidity New social adjustments must neces sarily follow Profound technological changes compel attention to economic problems Modern social dynamics cannot be understood with out searching out the effect of technology on civilization It is one thing however to search out the influence of a single factor and quite a different thing to refuse to seek out the influence of other factors A useful tool need not be made a dogma ALVIN H HANSEN UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA 83

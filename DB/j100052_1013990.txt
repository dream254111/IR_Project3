WOMANS COMMITTEEk BY JESSICA B PEIXOTTO Executive Chairman Child Welfare Department Womans Committee Council of National Defense When appointed a part of the Council of National Defense April 21 1917 the Womans Committee organized at once into ten departments One of these was the Department of Child Welfare The primary business of the Womans Committee was to effect an organization of the woman power of the country and so put a force of no mean value for war work at the disposal of the govern ment This business of centralizing and coordinating the ninety two national organizations including about eleven million women now affiliated with the committee was no light task It occupied the Womans Committee for the first months of its existence When the state divisions had finally been organized when counties towns districts wards and even precincts had been provided with com mittees paralleling the organization of the Womans Committee at Washington the result of eight months of energetic effort was some ten thousand units of organization ready to take up the numerous services the war has laid upon the citizenship of the country A program of Child Welfare had been prepared In April 1917 Mrs Josiah Evans Cowles a member of the committee and also President of the General Federation of Womens Clubs became the national chairman of the Department of Child Welfare With admirable keenness of vision Mrs Cowles and the Womans Com mittee turned at once to Miss Julia Lathrop Chief of the Childrens Bureau of the United States Department of Labor inviting her to take the executive chairmanship of the Department of Child Welfare and direct the wartime program for children It was a fortunate arrangement this close cooperation between the Womans Committee and the Childrens Bureau Both parties to the plan were strengthened by it the community was assured a sound program of democratic work for children Allying itself with the Womans Committee the Childrens Bureau gained the use of an organization with a wider grasp and reach than any ever before effected in the nations history The Womans Committee on the 18 257THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY other hand was enabled to act with the least possible amateurish ness its Child Welfare Department became in the best sense an extension of a government bureau and thus from the start avoided those wastes that arise from paralleling government work Thus there are two groups always mutually dependenttrained govern ment investigators sobered by the discipline of regular research work and enthusiastic volunteers as rich in eager earnestness as they are apt to be poor in experience now collaborating to work out the program and push the events of the Childrens Year The period from May to December 1917 was a time of pre liminaries What correspondence went out to the state divisions of the Womans Committee went from the Childrens Bureau The Chief of the Childrens Bureau in her fifth annual report of June 1917 page 49 writes The pressing essentials of a reasonable childwelfare program for the United States in war time may be condensed under four heads I Public protection of maternity and infancy II Mothers care for older children III Enforcement of all childlabor laws and full schooling for all children of school age Standards should be maintained in spite of war pressure IV Recreation for children and youth abundant decent protected from any form of exploitation This program the Womans Committee adopted at their Decem ber meeting as the program of their Child Welfare Department It was plain that to set the details of such a program before fortyeight states and three territories would require much special attention Miss Lathrop knew her staff at the bureau was more than occupied with their regular service of research She therefore suggested that a separate service be provided through the Council of National Defense to make the connection between the bureaus program and the womens defense organizations of the country At the Decem ber meeting of the Womans Committee Dr Jessica B Peixotto professor of social economics at the University of California was invited to take charge of this service The separate service for the work of organizing corresponding and transmitting has in the period since January grown to a large clerical force busily and breathlessly engaged in sending out hundreds of letters thousands of leaflets pamphlets posters and other printed matter for propaganda and publicity and millions of weighing and measuring cards 258CHILDRENS YEAR AND WOMANS COMMITTEE During the months that lie between January 15 and the time of writing this report the Childrens Year has been announced the state divisions of the Womans Committee have accepted the re sponsibility the program lays upon them for the most part with alacrity and fine imagination Thoroughgoing child welfare de partments have been organized in all but one state One confer ence of the state chairmen of child welfare has been held at Washing ton Hearty participation in the work at such points as mutual objects permit has been given by the National Committee on Child Welfare of the General Medical Board under Dr S McC Hamill the Department of Civilian Relief of the American Red Cross through its director general Mr W Frank Persons the nursing section of the American Red Cross under Miss Jane Delano the nursing sec tion of the Council of National Defense through Miss Ella Phillips Crandall the United States Bureau of Education United States Public Health Service and the United States Department of Agricul ture and by more than a score of national societies interested in the recreation of children The plan all this machinery furthers the plan to take thought in time to save the children sensitive source of our future popula tion was named The Childrens Year When this Childrens Year program of prevention and protection was set before Presi dent Wilson by the Secretary of Labor the nations leader promptly expressed his belief in the wisdom and foresight of it The following letter addressed to Secretary Wilson appeared in the press April 3 Next to the duty of doing everything possible for the soldiers at the front there could be it seems to me no more patriotic duty than that of protecting the children who constitute onethird of our population The success of the efforts made in England in behalf of the children is evidenced by the fact that the infant deathrate in England for the second year of the war was the lowest in her history Attention is now being given to education and labor conditions for children by legislatures in both France and England showing that the conviction among the Allies is that the protection of childhood is essential to winning the war I am very glad that the same processes are being set afoot in this country and I heartily approve the plan of the Childrens Bureau and the Womans Committee of the Council of National Defense for making the second year of the war one of united activity on behalf of the children and in that sense a Childrens Year I trust that the year will not only see the goal reached of saving 100000 lives of infants and young children but that the work may so successfully develop as to set up certain irreducible minimum standards for health education and work for the American Child Cordially and sincerely yours WOODROW WILSON 259THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY The general challenge of the Childrens Year calls for a square deal for all children young and old The one most definite task set down in the program for the states is the summons to save 100000 babies The facts at home and abroad warranted the summons even in war time perhaps most of all in war time Careful investigations continuously prove at least onethird of the deaths of infants unnecessary The first draft showed that about onefourth of the defects which sent young men home humil iated by a discharge might have been remedied in childhood Life saving always a duty becomes imperative in war time physical deterioration is at such a time more than ever to be avoided To do away with preventable death and defect is the most definite busi ness of Childrens Year What had happened in other warring countries proved such a step not merely advisable but imperative Shortly after England entered into the war it was found that human life was being used up at two points Her men were dying on the battlefields of France but in great part because of war conditions her mothers and babies were dying at home faster than usual Alarmed at the situation the government took prompt steps to prevent such unnecessary loss of life Englands slogan adopted to advertise the situation was somewhat beyond the facts but artistic exaggeration is often more effective than scientific exactness The posters that warned Eng land of the danger menacing the future population bore the legend It is safer to be a soldier in France than a baby at home  The Childrens Year program should save us in the United States the thrill of horror that ran through the English as they read this legend England took prompt action The results show what intelligent group action can do for social improvement The death rate which had risen to 110 in a thousand was brought down to 91 in a thousand the lowest mortality rate on record for England France too in spite of the war that strains her heart and nerve has since 1914 taken steps to see that no woman is ignored and no child forgotten In Belgium the corrective and preventive work being done is first of all work for children in Italy thoroughgoing precautions are under way Germanys solicitude about the protec tion of her next generation has been unremitting These precedents of foresight added to our own investigations already mentioned were warrant for the challenge to save 100000 babies for the nation when life must be used up on the field of honor 260CHILDRENS YEAR AND WOMANS COMMIPTE 2 As first precautionary step a stocktaking as it were of the children of preschool age was suggesteda weighing and measur ing test The height and weight of a child is a rough index of its physical development The weighing and measuring test was therefore proposed to get this height and weight for every child of preschool age in the country The period from April 6the begin ning of the Childrens Yearto June 6 was the time appointed for carrying on this ambitious enterprise never before undertaken in this country All but one state have undertaken the test In most it is still going on The Childrens Bureau has issued and the Womans Committee has distributed over six million cards When these are filled out and returned the results will be tabulated and published In the meantime however in each community where the work of conservation with scales and a tape measure has wisely begun special notes have been taken and a stock of facts will call for special action Malnutrition that stunts growth should have been identified the appropriate treatment especially sufficient milk and other food should follow In general after the weighing and measuring test those spe cially interested in child hygiene will be urged to push other ade quate measures that save babies for the nation The best means for educating the individual and the community are public health nurses More of these trained women are needed more fully equipped and paid properly in money and repute One hundred per cent birth registration we must have instead of our present slat ternly social accounting Better prenatal care better obstetrical care more infant welfare stations and health centers are also to be urged In a word a widespread and unremitting propaganda for the best preventive health measures is to spread all over the land not only in the urban districts but in the rural as well To plan and to urge is the part of the central government The Childrens Bureau and the Womans Committee have done this work Thanks to a fine display of energy and initiative on the part of fortyseven state chairmen thanks to the hearty response from some 11000 unit chairmen a thing which needed to be done is being carried on in a manner that warrants high faith in the outcome On the whole it is possible to report progress in all but one state The work everywhere regularly improves in quantity intensity and quality The social chasms are narrowing Ingenuity 261THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY has raised money by special quest from private benevolence or in a dozen states from state funds The press has generously given publicity repeating facts again and again and with increasing detail answering doubts and teaching that children a part of the nations defense and strength must be protected not used up A dozen states have posters that blazon this forth In several states buttons of various devices decorate the person or testimonial cards hang in the homes of those whose little ones have been weighed Before the Childrens Year is over every publicity expedient will be tried Each week sees a widening circle of the men of the defense organiza tions and the general public quickening to the call of its program The Childrens Bureau provides the call the Womans Com mittee and the state divisions answer the men and women of the country are rallying so that it is fairly certain that the stigma of ignorance and failure to provide for the nations future citizens will not fall upon us New tasks and opportunities will come as the drives for healthy play more months of school and assured home care are added to the present wellannounced drive for health When children bear burdens the nation suffers when children lack school ing that prepares them for life the nation suffers when they lack mothers care and home life they and the nation suffer most of all The Childrens Year means constructive conservation If its pro gram can be realized the nations children will walk more freely to be the strength of the next generation 262

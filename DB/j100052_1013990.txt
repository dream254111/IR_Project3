DEPARTMENT OF AGRICUL TURE AND BY MORE THAN A SCORE OF NATIONAL SOCIETIES INTERESTED IN THE RECREATION OF CHILDREN THE PLAN ALL THIS MACHINERY FURTHERS THE PLAN TO TAKE THOUGHT IN TIME TO SAVE THE CHILDREN SENSITIVE SOURCE OF OUR FUTURE POPULA TION WAS NAMED THE CHILDRENS YEAR WHEN THIS CHILDRENS YEAR PROGRAM OF PREVENTION AND PROTECTION WAS SET BEFORE PRESI DENT WILSON BY THE SECRETARY OF LABOR THE NATIONS LEADER PROMPTLY EXPRESSED HIS BELIEF IN THE WISDOM AND FORESIGHT OF IT THE FOLLOWING LETTER ADDRESSED TO SECRETARY WILSON APPEARED IN THE PRESS APRIL 3 NEXT TO THE DUTY OF DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE FOR THE SOLDIERS AT THE FRONT THERE COULD BE IT SEEMS TO ME NO MORE PATRIOTIC DUTY THAN THAT OF PROTECTING THE CHILDREN WHO CONSTITUTE ONETHIRD OF OUR POPULATION THE SUCCESS OF THE EFFORTS MADE IN ENGLAND IN BEHALF OF THE CHILDREN IS EVIDENCED BY THE FACT THAT THE INFANT DEATHRATE IN ENGLAND FOR THE SECOND YEAR OF THE WAR WAS THE LOWEST IN HER HISTORY ATTENTION IS NOW BEING GIVEN TO EDUCATION AND LABOR CONDITIONS FOR CHILDREN BY LEGISLATURES IN BOTH FRANCE AND ENGLAND SHOWING THAT THE CONVICTION AMONG THE ALLIES IS THAT THE PROTECTION OF CHILDHOOD IS ESSENTIAL TO WINNING THE WAR I AM VERY GLAD THAT THE SAME PROCESSES ARE BEING SET AFOOT IN THIS COUNTRY AND I HEARTILY APPROVE THE PLAN OF THE CHILDRENS BUREAU AND THE WOMANS COMMITTEE OF THE COUNCIL OF NATIONAL DEFENSE FOR MAKING THE SECOND YEAR OF THE WAR ONE OF UNITED ACTIVITY ON BEHALF OF THE CHILDREN AND IN THAT SENSE A CHILDRENS YEAR I TRUST THAT THE YEAR WILL NOT ONLY SEE THE GOAL REACHED OF SAVING 100000 LIVES OF INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN BUT THAT THE WORK MAY SO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP AS TO SET UP CERTAIN IRREDUCIBLE MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR HEALTH EDUCATION AND WORK FOR THE AMERICAN CHILD CORDIALLY AND SINCERELY YOURS WOODROW WILSON 259THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY THE GENERAL CHALLENGE OF THE CHILDRENS YEAR CALLS FOR A SQUARE DEAL FOR ALL CHILDREN YOUNG AND OLD THE ONE MOST DEFINITE TASK SET DOWN IN THE PROGRAM FOR THE STATES IS THE SUMMONS TO SAVE 100000 BABIES THE FACTS AT HOME AND ABROAD WARRANTED THE SUMMONS EVEN IN WAR TIME PERHAPS MOST OF ALL IN WAR TIME CAREFUL INVESTIGATIONS CONTINUOUSLY PROVE AT LEAST ONETHIRD OF THE DEATHS OF INFANTS UNNECESSARY THE FIRST DRAFT SHOWED THAT ABOUT ONEFOURTH OF THE DEFECTS WHICH SENT YOUNG MEN HOME HUMIL IATED BY A DISCHARGE MIGHT HAVE BEEN REMEDIED IN CHILDHOOD LIFE SAVING ALWAYS A DUTY BECOMES IMPERATIVE IN WAR TIME PHYSICAL DETERIORATION IS AT SUCH A TIME MORE THAN EVER TO BE AVOIDED TO DO AWAY WITH PREVENTABLE DEATH AND DEFECT IS THE MOST DEFINITE BUSI NESS OF CHILDRENS YEAR WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN OTHER WARRING COUNTRIES PROVED SUCH A STEP NOT MERELY ADVISABLE BUT IMPERATIVE SHORTLY AFTER ENGLAND ENTERED INTO THE WAR IT WAS FOUND THAT HUMAN LIFE WAS BEING USED UP AT TWO POINTS HER MEN WERE DYING ON THE BATTLEFIELDS OF FRANCE BUT IN GREAT PART BECAUSE OF WAR CONDITIONS HER MOTHERS AND BABIES WERE DYING AT HOME FASTER THAN USUAL ALARMED AT THE SITUATION THE GOVERNMENT TOOK PROMPT STEPS TO PREVENT SUCH UNNECESSARY LOSS OF LIFE ENGLANDS SLOGAN ADOPTED TO ADVERTISE THE SITUATION WAS SOMEWHAT BEYOND THE FACTS BUT ARTISTIC EXAGGERATION IS OFTEN MORE EFFECTIVE THAN SCIENTIFIC EXACTNESS THE POSTERS THAT WARNED ENG LAND OF THE DANGER MENACING THE FUTURE POPULATION BORE THE LEGEND IT IS SAFER TO BE A SOLDIER IN FRANCE THAN A BABY AT HOME  THE CHILDRENS YEAR PROGRAM SHOULD SAVE US IN THE UNITED STATES THE THRILL OF HORROR THAT RAN THROUGH THE ENGLISH AS THEY READ THIS LEGEND ENGLAND TOOK PROMPT ACTION THE RESULTS SHOW WHAT INTELLIGENT GROUP ACTION CAN DO FOR SOCIAL IMPROVEMENT THE DEATH RATE WHICH HAD RISEN TO 110 IN A THOUSAND WAS BROUGHT DOWN TO 91 IN A THOUSAND THE LOWEST MORTALITY RATE ON RECORD FOR ENGLAND FRANCE TOO IN SPITE OF THE WAR THAT STRAINS HER HEART AND NERVE HAS SINCE 1914 TAKEN STEPS TO SEE THAT NO WOMAN IS IGNORED AND NO CHILD FORGOTTEN IN BELGIUM THE CORRECTIVE AND PREVENTIVE WORK BEING

ACCOUNTING BETTER PRENATAL CARE BETTER OBSTETRICAL CARE MORE INFANT WELFARE STATIONS AND HEALTH CENTERS ARE ALSO TO BE URGED IN A WORD A WIDESPREAD AND UNREMITTING PROPAGANDA FOR THE BEST PREVENTIVE HEALTH MEASURES IS TO SPREAD ALL OVER THE LAND NOT ONLY IN THE URBAN DISTRICTS BUT IN THE RURAL AS WELL TO PLAN AND TO URGE IS THE PART OF THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT THE CHILDRENS BUREAU AND THE WOMANS COMMITTEE HAVE DONE THIS WORK THANKS TO A FINE DISPLAY OF ENERGY AND INITIATIVE ON THE PART OF FORTYSEVEN STATE CHAIRMEN THANKS TO THE HEARTY RESPONSE FROM SOME 11000 UNIT CHAIRMEN A THING WHICH

DAVID M PROCTOR EARLE L BEATTY J REUBEN CLARK Jr RALPH J SCHWARZ J MARTIN GRIFFITH KAHL C BATES W CARR MORROW WILBUR L CUMMINGS RUSSELL T MOUNT NOTES TRIAL BY JURY FOR PErrY OFFENCESThe Constitution of the United States provides that the trial of all crimes except in cases of impeachment shall be by jury Art IlI  2 3 The pro vision is not expressly restricted as to the grade of crimes to which it applies and on its face appears to be absolute with the single mentioned exception The federal Supreme Court has however recently held that the provision does not apply to petty offences Schick v U S 1904 195 U S 65 The plaintiff in error in this case was prosecuted for receiving for sale oleomargerine not stamped according to law He was tried without a jury and the court im posed the statutory penalty of 5000 The Supreme Court in con sidering the effect of the Constitutional provision pointed out that in the original draft of a constitution in the Convention of 1787 the provision was for the trial of all criminal offences  by jury saying that the substitution of the expression  all crimes  for that of all criminal offences showed an intention to restrict the operation of the provision to grave offences and quoted the passage from Black stone where he says that crimes and misdemeanors are violations of public law and are properly mere synonymous terms but that in common usage graver offences only are called crimes and lighter ones misdemeanors The court ascribes to the framers of the Con stitution an intention to use the word crime in its vague popular meaning but it would seem more likely that a body of lawyers making use of the standard legal textbook of the day in establish ing the supreme law of the land would adopt the meaning therein declared to be the proper one Art XI  4 in the dratt of a constitution submitted to the con vention by its committee provided for the trial of all criminal offences in the State where committed and by jury This was unanimously amended to read in substantially its present form the arrangement of the section being changed provision made for crimes not committed in any State and the expression all criminal offences changed toall crimes MADISON says of the change The object of this amendment was to provide for a trial by jury of offences committed out of any State Madison Papers Vol III p 1441 MADISONS failure when stating one reason for the change to mention any such significance in it as the court finds and particularly his use of the rejected word offences would indicate that there was no deliberate change of the kind suggested by the court HAMILTON in the Fed eralist too says that all  criminal causes  are triable by jury No 83 Several passages in the Constitution indicate that when the operation of a provision is meant to be restricted to offences of a certain gravity such an intention is clearly shown In providing for the jurisdiction of federal courts the expression felonies on the high seas is used Art I  8 to in providing for indictment capital or otherwise infamous crime Amend V in defining the grounds for impeachment  treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors Art II  4 In providing for extradition the Constitution mentions treason felony or other crime Art IV  2 2 In Kentucky v Dennison 1860 24 How 66 TANEY C J speaking for the court declared that the use of the word  crime  in this clause instead of the expression  high misdemeanor as in the Articles of Confederation showed the deliberate purpose to include every offence known to the law of the State from which the party charged had fled In England many criminal offences particularly minor ones were punished summarily without the intervention of a jury at the time of the adoption of the Constitution but these summary convictions were not the result of any principles of the common law but of Acts of Parliament authorizing the trial of particular offences in that man ner Blackstone Bk 4 p 280 This practice was declared by BURN in his  Justice the eleventh edition of which appeared in 1770 to be a  tacit repeal of that famous clause in the Great Charter that a man shall be tried by his equals Vol I p 373 and BLACKSTONE protested against it as threatening the disuse ot our admirable and truly English trial by jury unless only in capital cases Bk IV p 281 In view of these strong expressions by writers conceded to have had a great influence on the members of the Constitutional Con vention it seems unlikely that the Convention intended to perpetuate the practice prevailing in England by the use of the simple expres sion  the trial of all crimes shall be by jury Nor does it seem that the Supreme Court has followed the English system In Callan v Wilson I888 127 U S 540 the petitioner was tried summarily convicted and sentenced to pay 2500 or in default thereof to thirty days imprisonment The offence was conspiracy to prevent a certain person from pursuing his lawful calling The court declared the petitioner entitled to a jury trial though in Rex v Vipont 176I 2 Burr 1163 on facts strikingly similar the defendant was summarily convicted by the English court A comparison of the principal case and Callan v Wilson shows a disposition on the part of the Supreme Court to treat the kind of punishment whether imprisonment or money penalty as an important and perhaps the determining factor though it is doubtful whether or not the court would make this an in variable test NO 2TES 49COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW The clause in the federal Constitution is conceded to refer only to the federal courts Eilenbecker v District Court 1889 134 U S 3I but jury trial is provided for in all the State constitutions In many perhaps a majority the provision is for the preservation of trial by jury Under such a provision a summary conviction valid before the adoption of the constitution would of course still be valid Byers v Comm i862 42 Pa St 89 In construing clauses similar to the federal provision however the cases are not uniform Many hold as in the principal case Ex parte Marx 1889 86 Va 40 Stale v Conlin 1855 27 Vt 318 while some reach the opposite re sult In re Rolfs 1883 30 Kans 758 Belatli v Pierce 1896 8 S D 456 In Callan v Wilson supra is a dictum that there are cases where jury trial is not required by the federal Constitution but while on the Kansas bench BREWER J pointed out the importance of the distinction between a provision preserving trial by jury and one requiring all crimes to be tried by jury In re Rolfs supra The distinction seems well taken and it applies with still stronger force to the case of the federal Constitution in view of the condemnation of the practice of summary convictions pronounced by influential legal writers of the time of its adoption The courts have been much pressed by practical considerations The very great inconvenience of requiring trial byjury for trivial offences and the long acquiescence in summary convictions and the conse quent revolution as it is termed by several courts which would follow a declaration of a universal right of trial by jury are considera tions of very great weight and it is these considerations which are perhaps a warrant for the result reached in the principal case There are however practical objections to the rule of the principal case for there is no definite line between the cases there declared triable by jury and those not necessarily so triable and instead of a uniform rule for all cases there are substituted two rules the extent of the application of which is and necessarily must remain more or less uncertain DOUBLE TAXATION BY COMPETING AUTHORITIESWhile the ancient principle that political allegiance formed the basis of the individuals fiscal obligation to the government has generally been abandoned the States are not always in harmony as to what principle shall supersede it Two views are constantly conflicting one that the owners domi cile shall determine the government to which the obligation is due and the other that the location of the property shall be the test Without exception the latter the socalled rule of situs is applied to real estate and the property is taxed where located With regard to personalty however many of the States have adopted a rule of the common law mobilia sequuntur personam as an expression of the principle and the property is taxed at the domicile of the owner Story Conflict of Laws 8th ed  362 383 550 Many of the States have even here applied the rule of situs some by statute Ind Rev Stat sec 6287 and some by judicial interpretation Hoyi v Comm i861 23 N Y 224 It is clear that neither principle applied to the exclusion of the other is entirely satisfactory from an economic standpoint Seligman

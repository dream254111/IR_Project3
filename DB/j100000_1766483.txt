generally in connection with silver argentiferous galena  and sometimes with gold Bismuth and antimony are found in combination witll ores of other metals but not as yet in considerable quantities Up to the present the deposits of coal discovered are not relatively so extensive as those of iron but its presence has been determined in Sao Paulo where the borings indicated its existence in quantities and situations that render probable a profitable extraction In Santa Caterina in the valley of the Tubarao bituminous coal exists and a concession has been granted by the Government for working the beds The State of Rio Grande do Sul appears to be the most favored in respect to coal deposits In the Candiota basin veins of coal crop out of a thickness varying from four to six feet but the only mines worked up to the present are those of Arrois dos Ratos which supply coal to the steamers that ply ion the river and to the Government railway Marbles are abundant and widely distributed they are of various colors and resist the disintegrating influences of the climate under conditions destructive of the marble imported from Europe In Rio Grande do Sul and Sao Paulo are various manufactures of works of marble Important de posits of loadstone are found in Minas Geraes In the State of Goyaz in the Sierra dos Cristaes Crystal Range are found in abundance the wellknown Brazilian pebbles whose pure quartz is employed in the manufacture of lenses and spectacles They are found near the surface usually covered with a coating of iron oxide In the calcareous caverns of the San Francisco plateau and of the river Velhas in MinOs Geraes saltpetre has for a long time been collected One of these grottoes near Diamantina furnished within a few days after its discovery forty tons of the pure crystals cGraphite is also found in considerable quantities in Minas Geraes one of the deposits yielding 83 per cent of carbon suitable for pencils THE CLIMATOLOGY OF BRAZIL A PAMPHLET by Sr H Morize entitled Esbo9o de uma Climatologia do Brazil has been issued from the Observa tory of Rio Janeiro The author divides the country into three great zones  tropical subtropical and temperate The first in which the mean temperature exceeds 77 F embraces the northern part of Brazil and is bounded to the south by a line running along the south side of the State of Pernam buco across Goyaz and somewhat to the south of Cuyaba The second lies between the isothermals of 77 and 68 and extends into S Paulo and Parana leaving a portion of these provinces with Sta Catharina and Rio Grande do Sul to form the third zone in which the mean temperature oscil lates between 68Q and 59 The tropical zone may be again divided into three regions the Upper Amazons Matto Grosso and the interior of the states on the Atlantic border and the Littoral On the Upper Amazons there are two rainy seasons the principal one last ing from the end of February to June and the other from the middle of October to the beginning of January During the intervening dry season the rivers fall sometimes as much as 46 feet Sr J Pinkas found that the mean temperature was 79 but the maximum was 103 which is comparatively low The heat however was very oppressive owing to the excessive moisture in the air The prevailing wind blows VOL XVIII No 460 from the southwest and is frequently interrupted by calms Towards the end of the great rains the phenomenon known as friagem occurs which is a sudden fall of temperature produced by an influx of cold air from the Andes It can only take place on a calm day and is preceded by a high temperature an almost complete saturation of the air and a barometric fall of about 2 inches In the second subdivision heavy rains occur in spring and summer and the thermometer often rises as much as 35 in a few hours These sudden changes are produced by the rapid alternations of northwest and southeast winds the former warm and moist the latter always very cold Dr Morsback gives the mean temperature as 7925 F The average rain fall is 459 inches and the number of raining days 85 In this region also there is a period of friagem The third subdivision is characterized by rains in summer and autumn and particularly during the month of April The differences of temperature are much less than in the other subdivisions 84 F having been recorded at Vizeu in Para during December the warmest month and 80 F at the same hour 9 AM during July the coolest month The mean rainfall is about 58 inches In the dry season the prairies are withered and scorched by the heat and the cat tle that feed on them suffer terribly Occasionally the rains do not make their appearance at all and then famine spreads throughout the country This calamity has occurred six times already during the present century The subtropical zone closely resembles the warm regions of the south of Europe Both the temperature and the rain fall vary considerably according to the situation The cli mate of the third zone is one of the finest in the world and therefore the States comprised in it have been almost exclu sively chosen by European immigrants The rainy season does not occur in the same months as in the other regions rain falls chiefly in the winter and autumn As the distance from the equator increases the transition between the wet and dry seasons becomes less distinct The meteorology of Sao Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul has already been noticed in the Scottish Meteorological Journal vol vi p 332 and vol vii 556 Sr Morizes paper is very useful for those who wish to study the subject minutely for he has col lected numerous records of observations from all parts of the country YEZO THE island of Yezo or Hokkaido has an area of about 30500 square miles Its population said to have been 27000 in 1869 was in 1889 254805 including the Kurile Islands according to the Japanese census reports The Government according to the Scottish Geographical Magazine is actively develop ing the country It is constructing a network of roads by convict labor and intends to form a new capital near the source of the river Ishikari The plan provides for 17472 colonists besides 1920 houses for Tondenhe These latter are military colonists each of whom receives a grant of about 8 acres of land and a house on condition of serving in war up to the age of 40 Another town is to be founded on the Sarachi A railway from Sapporo to Mororan has been pro posed the harbor at this place being more convenient than that of Orunai where the coal of Yezo is now shipped The dwellings of the inhabitants are by no means adapted to the rigor of the climate those of the military colonists are slightly superior and consist of two apartments Cultiva tion and fishing are the chief occupations Vegetables millet potatoes wheat barley rice and beetroot are cultiNOVEMBER 27 18911 SCIE vated the last for the making of sugar Cattle pigs and other domestic animals are kept in small numbers but little attention is bestowed upon them The Government has set up mills and sugar and hemp factories At present they have not been remarkably active owing either to the defi ciency of raw material or to the absence of a demand for the finished article Fishing is a far more important industry The annual value of the products of the sea is about 833000 and it is on them exclusively that the taxes are levied Herrings salmon and trout are extraordinarily plentiful on the northern and western coasts of the island and cod is caught in the deep water The native fishermen number about 60000 and in the season these are reinforced by hired men from the island of Nipon There are in the whole island about 17000 Ainos but their number is decreasing owing to the effects of disease and more than all intermarriage with the Japanese In the northeast they are still in a state of degradation but along the shores of Volcano Bay they are beginning to occupy themselves in agriculture They are well treated by the Government and enjoy the same rights as Japanese Where it is possible their children attend the Japanese schools PROFESSOR PICTETS LABORATORY AT BERLIN IT has often been remarked that purely scientific research frequently bears fruit of practical value A fresh illustration of this fact is afforded by the work of Professor Pictet the eminent man of science of Geneva who is turning to practi cal account the apparatus by which in 1877 he first reduced hydrogen and oxygen to the liquid state At Berlin where he now resides he has established on the scale of a small factory what he terms a  laboratoire a basses temperatures The following account of the work carried on and the results obtained is taken from papers read by the professor before different scientific societies of Berlin The refrigerating machinery driven by several powerful steamengines is intended to withdraw heat from the objects under observation and to keep them at any temperature be tween  20Q and 200 C as long as may be required Pro fessor Pictets experience has led him to the conclusion that among the refrigerating agents known such as rarefaction of gases dissolution of salts evaporation of liquids the latter is to be preferred A long course of research has further enabled him to choose the most convenient from amongst the great number of suitable liquids In order to avoid the great pressure required in handling the highly evaporative substances of lowest boilingpoint which serve to produce ex treme cold it is necessary to divide the difference of tem perature into several stages Each stage is fitted with especial apparatus consisting of an airpump worked by steam which drains off the vapors of the liquid from the refrigerator and forces them into a condenser whence reduced to the liquid state they are again offered for evaporation in the refrigera tor Thus the liquid without any loss beyond leakage passes through a continuous circuit and the operations can be carried on for any length of time The liquid made use of for the first stage is the mixture of sulphurous acid and a small percentage of carbonic acid called  liquide Pictet It is condensed at a pressure of about two atmospheres in a spiral tube merely cooled by running water Oxide of nitro gen laughing gas is the liquid chosen for the second stage Its vapors are condensed in the same way at a pressure about five or six times as great in a tube maintained at about 80 1 From Nature NCE 303 by the action of the first circuit As medium for a third stage in which however continuous circulation has not yet been attempted atmospheric air is employed which passes into the liquid state at a pressure of no more than about 75 atmospheres provided the condenser is kept at 135 by the first two circuits The evaporation of the liquefied air causes the thermometer to fall below 200 By this combination quite new conditions for investigating the properties of matter are realized In various branches of science new and surprising facts have already been brought to light Many laws and observations will have to be reex amined and altered with regard to changes at an extremely low temperature For instance a remarkable difference was noted in the radiation of heat Material considered a nonconductor of heat does not appear to affect much the passage of heat into a body cooled down to below 100 Or to state the fact according to Professor Pictets view  The slow oscillations of matter which constitute the lowest degrees of heat pass more readily through the obstruction of a socalled noncon ductor than those corresponding to a higher temperature just as the less intense undulations of the red light are better able to penetrate clouds of dust or vapor than those of the blue If the natural rise of temperature in the refrigerator starting from 135 is noted in a tracing and afterwards the same refrigerator carefully packed in a covering of cot tonwool of more than half a yard in thickness and cooled down afresh and the rise of temperature again marked on comparing the tracings hardly any difference will be found in the two curves up to  100 and only a very slight devia tion even up to 50 On this ground it is clear that the ut most limit of cold that can possibly be attained is not much lower than that reached in the famous experiment of liquefac tion of hydrogen The quantity of warmth which hourly floods a cylinder 1250 millimetres high by 210 millimetres wide the size of the refrigerator at 80 is no less than 600 calories and no packing will keep it out At a lower tem perature the radiation being even greater the power of the machinery intendedto draw off still more heat would have to be enormous And as 273 is absolute zero the utmost Professor Pictet judges to be attainable is about 255 As an example of the surprising methods which the re frigerating machine permits the investigator to employ it may be mentioned that in order to measure the elasticity of mercury Professor Paalzow had the metal cast into the shape of a tuningfork and frozen hard enough for the purpose in view On this occasion it appeared that quicksilver can be shown in a crystallized state the crystals being of a beautiful fernlike appearance Glycerine was likewise made to crystallize and cognac after having been frozen was found to possess that peculiar mellowness commonly only attained by long keeping But the most important application of the refrigerating machinery has been the purification of chloroform under taken by Professor Pictet at the instance of Professor Lieb reich of the Pharmacological Institute Berlin Chloroform has hitherto been considered a most unstable and easily de filed substance The action of sunlight the slight impuri ties retained from the different processes of manufacture perhaps the mere settling down during protracted storage have invariably resulted in a more or less marked decompo sition By the simple process of crystallization this unsta bleness is got rid of and a practically unchangeable liquid is produced The crystals begin to form at 68 first cov ering the bottom of the vessel and gradually filling it up

towards education and the reproach is largely merited by the masters of the people But it is not today merited by certain influential sections The commercial world for twenty years or morehas been vigorously pushing forward technical education recently physicians aroused by the physical deterioration of our city populations have petitioned the Board of Education to take steps to counteract this evil through the schools and above all poli ticians Liberal and Conservative have become sensible of the fact that in order to maintain its prestige as a nation England must reform its educational system from the infant school up to the university Agitation in these sections of the community has already brought forth a considerable quantity of books very few of which however have permanent value Ferment is also spread ing inside the schools the germs of which have not infrequently been carried to us from foreign lands American books are read by English teachers and would be more widely read if they cost less In order that Dr John Deweys ideas might become better known Professor Findlay of Manchester University lately edited with permission a small collection of his educational essays which is published at 25 cents1 Herbartianism has now found a few ardent disciples and critics and a controversy about Herbarts theory of education is arousing reflection on the subject of educational principles generally among teachers in secondary schools Under these four headings viz state and school organiza tion of education hygiene and physical training reformed 1The School and the Child Being Selections from the Educational Essays of John Dewey Blackie  Son 40ITHE SCHOOL REVIEW methods and theory of education we may group elastically nearly all the books issued during the last five years or so There is no work of first rank very few we think of second or third rank but taken as a whole they show a good deal of hack ing and hewing of old growths and planting for new First in order of importance for a student of English educa tional systems are the Blue Books issued by the Board of Educa tion at Whitehall2 Reports drawn up by various inspectors and specially engaged experts of work in elementary schools secondary schools training colleges and universities also Codes and Regulations for all educational institutions wholly or par tially supported by the state Usually these volumes and pam phlets are dry reading to outsiders but now and again M L Morant the permanent Secretary to the Board of Education inserts an illuminating little preface his Suggestions to Teach ers in Elementary Schools I905 practically a proclama tion that to quote a phrase of Pestalozzi the educational wagon is to be turnel round and driven on a new track forms probably the best brief handbook on pedagogical method for young children extant The new Regulations for Training Colleges coming into force in August I907 have spread consternation among the sectarian institutions by decreeing that in no circumstances may the application of a candidate be rejected on the ground of religious faith This is not a step forward it is a leap whether into the dark or into the light The Office of Special Enquiries and Reports is continuing the valuable series of Special Reports formerly edited by Professor M E Sadler Recent additions consist of Vol XV The Teaching of Domestic Science in the United States by Miss A Ravenhill Vol XVI Domestic Science in Belgium Sweden Norway Denmark Switzerland and France Vol XVII Schools Public and Private in the North of Europe This office is also issuing now a series of brief Edu cational Pamphlets in the first numbers of which an im portant aspect of secondary education The Modern Side 2 Publishers Wyman  Co Fetter Lane London W C Books issued by the Board of Education can be obtained unbound at a low price 402PEDAGOGICAL LITERATURE IN ENGLAND of Public Schools is being discussed The modern side at Harrow at Eton etc practically corresponds to the Real gymnasium in Germany Another direction of school organization engaging the atten tion of our highest authorities is that of the local supply and local control of educational institutions Professor M E Sad ler of Manchester University Professor Adams of London University and others during recent years have been asked to investigate the whole series of the educational institutions pri mary secondary and higher of certain borough and county authorities with a view to render the supply in their districts adequate in every grade and to establish the grades on a well correlated system In a report of I906 the Board of Education stated that more than fifty reports of varying scope length and elaboration dealing with higher secondary and elementary education and prepared and published since the beginning of I903 have come within the notice of the Board Of these reports eight are the work of Professor M E Sadler and two of Professor J Adams names that are a guarantee of the broad standpoint from which the investigations and plans for future extension are being treated Together with reports etc on the present state of education in England issued by educational authorities we may class two books of independent origin Graham Balfours Educational Systems of Great Britain and Ireland I903 is a standard work replete with carefully prepared statistics and next in order may be mentioned a collection of essays by various educa tionists on Education in the Nineteenth Century3 which con tains a paper by Professor Sadler on National Educational and Social Ideals a philosophical contribution which in thought and language sets forth an inspiring vista of educational pos sibilities Turning now to the books resulting from efforts to improve the bodily health of the people we find many new school text books on hygiene and physiology textbooks frequently written by physicians These include Readers for class use to be made 3 Published by the Cambridge University Press 403THIE SCHOOL REVIEW use of by pupils from seven years of age up Physicians as yet know little about the mental development of children hence these books of lessons on cleanliness temperance food etc contain matter frequently quite unsuitable for the age contemplated Of more real worth for teachers is the Health of the School Child4 a small volume by Dr Leslie Mackenzie chief medical instructor of Edinburgh It is written primarily for medical inspectors of schools and contains chapters on such subjects as The Normal Growth of Children and School Doctors in Ger many Dr Mackenzie regards regular medical inspection of all children in the public schools as a necessity To these we may add The Children of the Nation How Their Health and Vigour Should Be Promoted by the State largely a plea for the school feeding of children by Sir J E Gorst late parliamentary secretary to the Board of Education and School Buildings 5 by Felix Clay an admirably full and careful description of schools of all typestechnical secondary etcillustrated by numerous pictures and plans Passing to our third group books bearing directly on cur ricula and methods we find that of late production has surged highest around the religious question shall religious faith and doctrine be taught or only the Bible and that in the form of a collection of books which are of the highest religious historical and literary importance A preponderating opinion in favor of the latter proposition is spreadingnot only among the laitybut also among the clergy especially among those known as High Church or Anglican The clergy and ministers who hold this view turn to the family and to the Sunday school for support in the teaching of doctrine and hence an organized movement is spreading for reform in Sundayschool methods Here again few of the books will win more than a temporary vogue The sound est as far as my observation extends are Reform in Sunday School Teaching6 a criticism of the International Sunday Published by Methner  Co 6 Published by Batsford  Co Clarke  Co 404PEDAGOGICAL LITERATURE IN ENGLAND School Lessons with suggestions for amended courses by Pro fessor A S Peake of Manchester University and Religious Education7 an attempt to treat Sundayschool instruction from the point of view of modern psychology and ethics by A E Garvie Cognate with the efforts of orthodox churchmen to reform the teaching of religious doctrine in the secondary school are those of the Moral Reform League to organize definite teaching of morality both in day and Sunday schools The leaders of the Moral Reform League are inclined like the physicians to rely too much on courses of detached lessons hence they are bringing out a series of lessonbooks consisting for the most part of brief stories intended to inculcate certain definite moral concep tions The editor of this series is Mr F J Gould8 A book bearing on the historical aspect of religion of impor tance to the student is Miss G Dodgess Primitive Christian Education9 It is a product of considerable research under taken to prove that the early Christian church did not dis courage secular learning Books emanating from the schools from teachers and pro fessors who are seeking to establish methods and organize instruction on scientific lines are numerous As a rule reforms take root first in the newer institutions and hence we must look for reformers in modern sides of public schools in the new universities or new departments of the old universities and in technical schools The teaching of modern languages by natural or oral methods is becoming everywhere popular especially during the earlier stages This movement owes much to Dr Karl Breuil of Cambridge author of The Teaching of Modern Foreign Lan guage10 a book which contains a good bibliography of the 7 Sunday School Union 1904 8 The Childrens Book of Moral Lessons by F J Gould Watts  Co 17 Johnsons Court Flat St London W C 9Published by Clark  Co 0 The Cambridge University Press I906 405THE SCHOOL REVIEW subject to Professor Walter Rippmann1 and Professor Victor Spiers12 In reformed methods of geography teaching Dr H J Mac kinder director of the London School of Economic and Political Science and Professor A J Herbertson reader in Geography to the University of Oxford are the chief leaders The former is now bringing out four volumes of schoolbooks called Ele mentary Studies in Geographyl3 the latter is joint author with his wife of textbooks and also of a series of Descriptive Geographies 4 books composed mainly of selections from original sources In regard to mathematics the new technical and science schools are naturally impatient of studies of a purely abstract type They want only such studies as are directly applicable for real ends and such methods as bring results surely and rapidly Hence teachers like Professor Henry Armstrong and Professor John Perry 5 have persistently advocated before the Educa tional Science Section of the British Association and before teachers conferences for the advancement of science that in geometry the methods of Euclid be abandoned and that the teaching of mathematics during the elementary stages be ap proximated to the teaching of elementary science especially to the teaching of physics Professor Armstrongs volume on The Teaching of Scientific Method 16 is a collection of twentyfour addresses and papers which cover a period of about twenty years they are very unequal in merit School textbooks pro fessing to expound arithmetic or geometry on new experimental and inductive principles are numerous but while adhering more closely to scientific method they do not as a rule approach the mental attitude of young children It is interesting to note nVarious textbooks for teaching French and German published by Dent  Co 12 Various textbooks for teaching French published by Whittaker  Co 13 Published by Nelson  Sons 4 Publishers Adam  Charles Black 15Discussion on the Teaching of Mathematics edited by John Perry Macmillan  Co I900 16 Published by Macmillan  Co 406PEDAGOGICAL LITERATURE IN ENGLAND that the more intelligent of these practical teachers are attack ing the arithmetic required in technical classes by methods advo cated in McClennan and Deweys Psychology of Number a book which apparently they have never seen They tell us that the arithmetic usually taught in schools is almost valueless in the physics class and hence their textbooks on elementary physics are largely filled with new exercises in Arithmetic17 We should also note some collections of songs which although not primarily intended for school purposes are des tined to exert I think a greater and more beneficial influence on the development of both heart and aim than new ways of teaching languages or arithmetic I refer to the introduction into the schools of ancient folksongs For a decade or more Mr Cecil Sharpe Professor Hadow and others have gone far afield to the old folk in country villages and back lanes and have taken down from their lips songs which they received from generations before them gradually a store has thus been won of priceless value and young people learn and sing them with the simple pleasure in the musical rhythms and ringing choruses that their forefathers experienced The melodies are retained in their ancient form the words usually need modification Our musical directors recommend that they should be sung in unisonl8 When we turn to seek for books expounding the principles of mental development and the general theory of education we are obliged to confess to great poverty I do not find a thor oughly strong book of purely English origin dated later than Professor John McCunns Making of Character19 I900 This is concise comprehensive and alive to the bearing of the laws of heredity and evolution on the growth of character Two recent volumes which are having some vogue set out with an exposition of modern psychological principles but fail 17 See Earls Physical Measurement a textbook in elementary physics pub lished by Macmillan  Co 18English

Two small volumes that show the direction to which our infant school wagon is being turned are Child Life in Our Schools22 by Miss M E Brown and School Gardening for Little Children23 by Miss L R Latter Both come from headmis tresses of large infants schools and describe courses of work and experiments in teaching in large classes of young children inspired by the new spirit in education Miss Latters book will prove of much service to teachers who make gardening a central subject Of books that focus attention on the child or on psychologi cal principles rather than on classroom method Miss M Mac millans monographs Early Childhood24 and Imagination in Education25 are exerting the widest influence Gifted with keen insight and intense sympathy Miss Macmillan is arousing and quickening many teachers and parents who have fallen into dead routine As already mentioned the controversy about the doctrines of Herbart is another breeze stirring stagnant waters The teacher who lately said to me when visiting her socalled kindergarten class we are not Froebelians we are Herbartians here had at least found some ground upon which to build a scholastic faith The most ardent devotee not to say fanatic of Herbar tianism is Mr F H Hayward author of The Secret of Her bart26 The Critics of Herbartianism26 and The Meaning of Education as Interpreted by Herbart26 Mr Hayward is doing a good work In England hitherto it is for the most part only the shell and rind of Herbarts doctrine the law of correlation and the formal steps that have been studied Mr Hayward 20 Nelson  Son I904 a2 Swan

the spirit and aim of his theory his endeavor to organize the whole of instruction for moral ends Unfortunately the real value of his exposition is obscured by his persistent polemical attitude he writes as if he were always spoiling for a fight His chief adversary has been Professor A Darroch27 of Edinburgh University Professor Darroch up holds the theory of selfactivity and selfrealization as incon sistent with the instruction and externally stimulated activity advocated by Herbart and his disciple Hayward Happily a mediator has appeared I say happily because our limited group of thinkers about educational principles were being rapidly enrolled nolens volens into two camps viz Froebelians or selfactivity and Herbartians or education by instruction advocates The reconciler is Dr John Davidson a Scotch schoolmaster whose recent volume A New Interpretation of Herbarts Psychology and Educational Theory through the Philosophy of Leibnitz28 will prove of interest and value to a wider circle than those concerned with its particular problem Dr Davidson takes so it appears to me a thoroughly philo sophical view of the situation Herbartian interest he writes is as much a selfrealization as anything can be the question is which term is the better working concept And again Instead of being at variance with or contradictory of the category of selfactivity they Herbarts concepts indicate the only way in which the self can find its highest and best realiza tion Of these three writers Mr Davidson is distinctly the more thoughtful lucid and scholarly His views of the pyschological foundations of mental discipline and development appear to be in harmony with those of the most recent school of philosophical writers the school known as Pragmatists or Humanists connected in England with the name of Professor Schiller29 27 Herbart and the Herbartian Theory of Education The Children Some Educational Problems Longmans  Co 2s Blackwood 2 Author of Axioms and Postulates The Riddles of the Sphinx and Humanism 409THE SCHOOL REVIEW of Oxford and in America with that of Dr John Dewey and of Professor William James If interest writes Professor Schiller is to be tabooed the whole theory of thought becomes a mere mass of useless machinery for it sustains and guides the movement of our thought It effects the necessary selection among the objects of our attention accepting what is consonant and rejecting what is discrepant with our aim in thinking And again The stream of Truth which waters the fertile field of conduct has its sources in the remote and lonely upland inter apices philosophiae  Here lie our watersheds thither lead the passes to the realms unknown hence past our ways and here it is that we must draw the frontier lines of right and wrong o3 Both Froebel and Herbart climbed these philosophical heights and both obtained visions of the same truths but from differ ent sides Dr Davidson has sought to ascend the heights and get both visions and has then endeavored to distinguish above them the water parting which while apparently separating them is in reality their source He is we may confidently hope a precursor of many great thinkers who having both strength and leisure to climb to the lonely uplands will after ward descend to the lowland plains where teachers harrassed by daily practical difficulties become blinded by dust sometimes of their own raising and lose the power to see clearly beyond the radius of their daily tasks With you in America the practice has grown common for the greatest psychologists and philosophical thinkersDr John Dewey Professor W James and othersto quit the heights now and again for the mental confusion of teachers confer ences and there to enlighten and guide the thinking of the com monschool assistant For various reasons this has not yet be come a practice in England but the writings of Dr SchiIler and of others among the younger philosophers are so closely related intellectually and sympathetically with the new spirit in educa tion that it will not be long we may hope before the two ranges 30 F C S Schiller Humanism p 36 Macmillan I903 4IOPEDAGOGICAL LITERATURE

schoolroom we shall win a firmer foothold and find more solid foundations for the great system of public instruction which is now in the process of organization

MORALITY BOTH IN DAY AND SUNDAY SCHOOLS THE LEADERS OF THE MORAL REFORM LEAGUE ARE INCLINED LIKE THE PHYSICIANS TO RELY TOO MUCH ON COURSES OF DETACHED LESSONS HENCE THEY ARE BRINGING OUT A SERIES OF

COURAGE SECULAR LEARNING BOOKS EMANATING FROM THE SCHOOLS FROM TEACHERS AND PRO FESSORS WHO ARE SEEKING TO ESTABLISH METHODS AND ORGANIZE INSTRUCTION ON SCIENTIFIC LINES ARE NUMEROUS AS A RULE REFORMS TAKE ROOT FIRST IN THE NEWER INSTITUTIONS AND HENCE WE MUST LOOK FOR REFORMERS IN MODERN SIDES OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THE NEW UNIVERSITIES OR NEW DEPARTMENTS OF THE OLD UNIVERSITIES AND IN TECHNICAL

GEOGRAPHIES 4 BOOKS COMPOSED MAINLY OF SELECTIONS FROM ORIGINAL SOURCES IN REGARD TO MATHEMATICS THE NEW TECHNICAL AND SCIENCE SCHOOLS ARE NATURALLY IMPATIENT OF STUDIES OF A PURELY ABSTRACT TYPE THEY WANT ONLY SUCH STUDIES AS ARE DIRECTLY APPLICABLE FOR REAL ENDS AND SUCH METHODS AS BRING RESULTS SURELY AND RAPIDLY HENCE TEACHERS LIKE PROFESSOR HENRY ARMSTRONG AND PROFESSOR JOHN PERRY 5 HAVE PERSISTENTLY ADVOCATED BEFORE THE EDUCA TIONAL SCIENCE SECTION OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION AND BEFORE TEACHERS CONFERENCES FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE THAT IN GEOMETRY THE METHODS OF EUCLID BE ABANDONED AND THAT THE TEACHING OF MATHEMATICS DURING THE ELEMENTARY STAGES BE AP PROXIMATED TO THE TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY SCIENCE ESPECIALLY TO THE TEACHING OF PHYSICS PROFESSOR ARMSTRONGS VOLUME ON THE TEACHING OF SCIENTIFIC METHOD 16 IS A COLLECTION OF TWENTYFOUR ADDRESSES AND PAPERS WHICH COVER A PERIOD OF ABOUT TWENTY YEARS THEY ARE VERY UNEQUAL IN MERIT SCHOOL TEXTBOOKS PRO FESSING TO EXPOUND ARITHMETIC OR GEOMETRY ON NEW EXPERIMENTAL AND INDUCTIVE PRINCIPLES ARE NUMEROUS BUT WHILE ADHERING MORE CLOSELY TO SCIENTIFIC METHOD THEY DO NOT AS A RULE APPROACH THE MENTAL ATTITUDE OF YOUNG CHILDREN IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE NVARIOUS TEXTBOOKS FOR TEACHING FRENCH AND GERMAN PUBLISHED BY DENT  CO 12 VARIOUS TEXTBOOKS FOR TEACHING FRENCH PUBLISHED BY WHITTAKER  CO 13 PUBLISHED BY

THAT THE MORE INTELLIGENT OF THESE PRACTICAL TEACHERS ARE ATTACK ING THE ARITHMETIC REQUIRED IN TECHNICAL CLASSES BY METHODS ADVO CATED IN MCCLENNAN AND DEWEYS PSYCHOLOGY OF NUMBER A BOOK WHICH APPARENTLY THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN THEY TELL US THAT THE ARITHMETIC USUALLY TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS IS ALMOST VALUELESS IN THE PHYSICS CLASS AND HENCE THEIR TEXTBOOKS ON ELEMENTARY PHYSICS ARE LARGELY FILLED WITH NEW EXERCISES IN ARITHMETIC17 WE SHOULD ALSO NOTE SOME COLLECTIONS OF SONGS WHICH ALTHOUGH NOT PRIMARILY INTENDED FOR SCHOOL PURPOSES ARE DES TINED TO EXERT I THINK A GREATER AND MORE BENEFICIAL INFLUENCE ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF BOTH HEART AND AIM THAN NEW WAYS OF TEACHING LANGUAGES OR ARITHMETIC I REFER TO THE INTRODUCTION INTO THE SCHOOLS OF ANCIENT FOLKSONGS FOR A DECADE OR MORE MR CECIL SHARPE PROFESSOR HADOW AND OTHERS HAVE GONE FAR AFIELD TO THE OLD FOLK IN COUNTRY VILLAGES AND BACK LANES AND HAVE TAKEN DOWN FROM THEIR LIPS SONGS WHICH THEY RECEIVED FROM GENERATIONS BEFORE THEM GRADUALLY A STORE HAS THUS BEEN WON OF PRICELESS VALUE AND YOUNG PEOPLE LEARN AND SING THEM WITH THE SIMPLE PLEASURE IN THE MUSICAL RHYTHMS AND RINGING CHORUSES THAT THEIR FOREFATHERS EXPERIENCED THE MELODIES ARE RETAINED IN THEIR ANCIENT FORM THE WORDS USUALLY NEED MODIFICATION OUR MUSICAL DIRECTORS RECOMMEND THAT THEY SHOULD BE SUNG IN UNISONL8 WHEN WE TURN TO SEEK FOR BOOKS EXPOUNDING THE PRINCIPLES OF MENTAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE GENERAL THEORY OF EDUCATION WE ARE OBLIGED TO CONFESS TO GREAT POVERTY I DO NOT FIND A THOR OUGHLY STRONG BOOK OF PURELY ENGLISH ORIGIN DATED LATER THAN PROFESSOR JOHN MCCUNNS MAKING OF CHARACTER19 I900 THIS IS CONCISE COMPREHENSIVE AND ALIVE TO THE BEARING OF THE LAWS OF HEREDITY AND EVOLUTION ON THE GROWTH OF CHARACTER TWO RECENT VOLUMES WHICH ARE

LATTER BOTH COME FROM HEADMIS TRESSES OF LARGE INFANTS SCHOOLS AND DESCRIBE COURSES OF WORK AND EXPERIMENTS IN TEACHING IN LARGE CLASSES OF YOUNG CHILDREN INSPIRED BY THE NEW SPIRIT IN EDUCATION MISS LATTERS BOOK WILL PROVE OF MUCH SERVICE TO TEACHERS WHO MAKE GARDENING A CENTRAL SUBJECT OF BOOKS THAT FOCUS ATTENTION ON THE CHILD OR ON PSYCHOLOGI CAL PRINCIPLES RATHER THAN ON CLASSROOM METHOD MISS M MAC MILLANS MONOGRAPHS EARLY CHILDHOOD24 AND IMAGINATION IN EDUCATION25 ARE EXERTING THE WIDEST INFLUENCE GIFTED WITH KEEN INSIGHT AND INTENSE SYMPATHY MISS MACMILLAN IS AROUSING AND QUICKENING MANY TEACHERS AND PARENTS WHO HAVE FALLEN INTO DEAD ROUTINE AS ALREADY MENTIONED THE CONTROVERSY ABOUT THE DOCTRINES OF HERBART IS ANOTHER BREEZE STIRRING STAGNANT WATERS THE TEACHER WHO LATELY SAID TO ME WHEN VISITING HER SOCALLED KINDERGARTEN CLASS WE ARE NOT FROEBELIANS WE ARE HERBARTIANS HERE HAD AT LEAST FOUND SOME GROUND UPON WHICH TO BUILD A SCHOLASTIC FAITH THE MOST ARDENT DEVOTEE NOT TO SAY FANATIC OF HERBAR TIANISM IS MR F H HAYWARD AUTHOR OF THE SECRET OF HER BART26 THE CRITICS OF HERBARTIANISM26 AND THE MEANING OF EDUCATION AS INTERPRETED BY HERBART26 MR HAYWARD IS DOING A GOOD WORK IN ENGLAND HITHERTO IT IS FOR THE MOST PART ONLY THE SHELL AND RIND OF HERBARTS DOCTRINE THE LAW OF CORRELATION AND THE FORMAL STEPS THAT HAVE BEEN STUDIED MR HAYWARD 20 NELSON  SON I904 A2 SWAN

THE SPIRIT AND AIM OF HIS THEORY HIS ENDEAVOR TO ORGANIZE THE WHOLE OF INSTRUCTION FOR MORAL ENDS UNFORTUNATELY THE REAL VALUE OF HIS EXPOSITION IS OBSCURED BY HIS PERSISTENT POLEMICAL ATTITUDE HE WRITES AS IF HE WERE ALWAYS SPOILING FOR A FIGHT HIS CHIEF ADVERSARY HAS BEEN PROFESSOR A DARROCH27 OF EDINBURGH UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR DARROCH UP HOLDS THE THEORY OF SELFACTIVITY AND SELFREALIZATION AS INCON SISTENT WITH THE INSTRUCTION AND EXTERNALLY STIMULATED ACTIVITY ADVOCATED BY HERBART AND HIS DISCIPLE HAYWARD HAPPILY A MEDIATOR HAS APPEARED I SAY HAPPILY BECAUSE OUR LIMITED GROUP OF THINKERS ABOUT EDUCATIONAL PRINCIPLES WERE BEING RAPIDLY ENROLLED NOLENS VOLENS INTO TWO CAMPS VIZ FROEBELIANS OR SELFACTIVITY AND HERBARTIANS OR EDUCATION BY INSTRUCTION ADVOCATES THE RECONCILER IS DR JOHN DAVIDSON A SCOTCH SCHOOLMASTER WHOSE RECENT VOLUME A NEW INTERPRETATION OF HERBARTS PSYCHOLOGY AND EDUCATIONAL THEORY THROUGH THE PHILOSOPHY OF LEIBNITZ28 WILL PROVE OF INTEREST AND VALUE TO A WIDER CIRCLE THAN THOSE CONCERNED WITH ITS PARTICULAR PROBLEM DR DAVIDSON TAKES SO IT APPEARS TO ME A THOROUGHLY PHILO SOPHICAL VIEW OF THE SITUATION HERBARTIAN INTEREST HE WRITES IS AS MUCH A SELFREALIZATION AS ANYTHING CAN BE THE QUESTION IS WHICH TERM IS THE BETTER WORKING CONCEPT AND AGAIN INSTEAD OF BEING AT VARIANCE WITH OR CONTRADICTORY OF THE CATEGORY OF SELFACTIVITY THEY HERBARTS CONCEPTS INDICATE THE ONLY WAY IN WHICH THE SELF CAN FIND ITS HIGHEST AND BEST REALIZA TION OF THESE THREE WRITERS MR DAVIDSON IS DISTINCTLY THE MORE THOUGHTFUL LUCID AND SCHOLARLY HIS VIEWS OF THE PYSCHOLOGICAL FOUNDATIONS OF MENTAL DISCIPLINE AND DEVELOPMENT APPEAR TO BE IN HARMONY WITH THOSE OF THE MOST RECENT SCHOOL OF PHILOSOPHICAL WRITERS THE SCHOOL KNOWN AS PRAGMATISTS OR HUMANISTS CONNECTED IN ENGLAND WITH THE NAME OF PROFESSOR SCHILLER29 27 HERBART AND THE HERBARTIAN THEORY OF EDUCATION THE CHILDREN SOME EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS LONGMANS  CO 2S BLACKWOOD 2 AUTHOR OF AXIOMS AND POSTULATES THE RIDDLES OF THE SPHINX AND HUMANISM 409THE SCHOOL REVIEW OF OXFORD AND IN AMERICA WITH THAT OF DR JOHN DEWEY AND OF PROFESSOR WILLIAM JAMES IF INTEREST WRITES PROFESSOR SCHILLER IS TO BE TABOOED THE WHOLE THEORY OF THOUGHT BECOMES A MERE MASS OF USELESS MACHINERY FOR IT SUSTAINS AND GUIDES THE MOVEMENT OF OUR THOUGHT IT EFFECTS THE NECESSARY SELECTION AMONG THE OBJECTS OF OUR ATTENTION ACCEPTING WHAT IS CONSONANT AND REJECTING WHAT IS DISCREPANT WITH OUR AIM IN THINKING AND AGAIN THE STREAM OF TRUTH WHICH WATERS THE FERTILE FIELD OF CONDUCT HAS ITS SOURCES IN THE REMOTE AND LONELY UPLAND INTER APICES PHILOSOPHIAE  HERE LIE OUR WATERSHEDS THITHER LEAD THE PASSES TO THE REALMS UNKNOWN HENCE PAST OUR WAYS AND HERE IT IS THAT WE MUST DRAW THE FRONTIER LINES OF RIGHT AND WRONG O3 BOTH FROEBEL AND HERBART CLIMBED THESE PHILOSOPHICAL HEIGHTS AND BOTH OBTAINED VISIONS OF THE SAME TRUTHS BUT FROM DIFFER ENT SIDES DR DAVIDSON HAS SOUGHT TO ASCEND THE HEIGHTS AND GET BOTH VISIONS AND HAS THEN ENDEAVORED TO DISTINGUISH ABOVE THEM THE WATER PARTING WHICH WHILE APPARENTLY SEPARATING THEM IS IN REALITY THEIR SOURCE HE IS WE MAY CONFIDENTLY HOPE A PRECURSOR OF MANY GREAT THINKERS WHO HAVING BOTH STRENGTH AND LEISURE TO CLIMB TO THE LONELY UPLANDS WILL AFTER WARD DESCEND TO THE LOWLAND PLAINS WHERE TEACHERS HARRASSED BY DAILY PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES BECOME BLINDED BY DUST SOMETIMES OF THEIR OWN RAISING AND LOSE THE POWER TO SEE CLEARLY BEYOND THE RADIUS OF THEIR DAILY TASKS WITH YOU IN AMERICA THE PRACTICE HAS GROWN COMMON FOR THE GREATEST PSYCHOLOGISTS AND PHILOSOPHICAL THINKERSDR JOHN DEWEY PROFESSOR W JAMES AND OTHERSTO QUIT THE HEIGHTS NOW AND AGAIN FOR THE MENTAL CONFUSION OF TEACHERS CONFER ENCES AND THERE TO ENLIGHTEN AND GUIDE THE THINKING OF THE COM MONSCHOOL ASSISTANT FOR VARIOUS REASONS THIS HAS NOT YET BE COME A PRACTICE IN ENGLAND BUT THE WRITINGS OF DR SCHIILER AND OF OTHERS AMONG THE YOUNGER PHILOSOPHERS ARE SO CLOSELY RELATED INTELLECTUALLY AND SYMPATHETICALLY WITH THE NEW SPIRIT IN EDUCA TION THAT IT WILL NOT BE LONG WE MAY HOPE BEFORE THE TWO RANGES 30 F C S SCHILLER HUMANISM P 36 MACMILLAN I903 4IOPEDAGOGICAL LITERATURE IN ENGLAND 4II OF THOUGHT PHILOSOPHY AND EDUCATION WILL MAKE DEFINITE CON TACT THEN WHEN THE BOLD AND EXPERIENCED ALPINE CLIMBERS GIVE THEIR SUPPORT TO TEACHERS SEEKING A PATH UPWARD FROM THE SCHOOLROOM WE SHALL WIN A FIRMER FOOTHOLD AND FIND MORE SOLID FOUNDATIONS FOR THE GREAT SYSTEM OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION WHICH IS NOW IN THE PROCESS OF ORGANIZATION

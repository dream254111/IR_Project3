referred to as an example of drainage transferred from the gulf system to the Atlantic through the process of stream capture Dr C Willard IHIayes in his paper on The Southern Appalachians published as a National Geographic Monograph cited this case as an instance of recent capture and ascribed the falls on the Tallulah River one of the headwaters of the Savannah to the fact that the newly acquired drainage had not been in possession of the captor sufficiently long for the falls to be worn down to grade In a paper entitled Drainage Modifications Jour Geol 1896 Mr M R Campbell notes this capture under the heading remote changes shown in the streams of the Atlantic slope Mr Chas T Simpson SCIENCE 1900 in discussing The Evidence of the Unionidae regarding the Former Courses of the Tennessee and other Southern Rivers reports the finding of mollusks similar to the Tennessee and Coosa River forms in theMARCH 105 1907 SCIENCE 429 Chattahoochee and Savannah Rivers and mol lusks of the Savannah drainage in the Chatta hoochee River From this he was led to sup port the theory of a capture of the upper Chattahoochee drainage by the Savannah River since the diversion in question would effect the transferrence of freshwater faunas from one stream to the other A paper on The Geology of the Tallulah Gorge Am Geol 1901 by Mr S P Jones discusses the general geology of the region mentions the possibility of capture already suggested by Hayes and Campbell but reaches no con clusion in regard to the matter Other refer ences to this capture are found in the litera ture but need not be repeated here Believing that the upper Savannah would probably show evidence of river capture and desiring to make a test of certain principles which had been applied in the case of the supposed capture of the upper Tennessee River with only negative results the writer spent a month in the Tallulah district during the spring of 1905 studying the geologic and physiographic features of the district with special reference to the supposed changes in drainage The evidence in favor of capture appeared to be quite conclusive A detailed discussion of the various elements of the prob lem will be found in the Proceedings of the Boston Society of Natural History Vol 33 No 5 but it is desired to outline certain phases of the subject here The results of this study appear to justify the following conclusions 1 The upper Savannah Chattooga River formerly flowed southwest through the Chatta hoochee River into the Gulf of Mexico but was diverted to the Atlantic drainage by a process of stream capture as already an nounced by Hayes and Campbell 2 The capture furnishes an example of what may be termed remote capture having occurred so long ago that much of the direct evidence has been obliterated 3 The capture seems to have resulted from the advantage gained by the Atlantic drainage over the gulf drainage owing to the shorter course to the sea which streams of the former system enjoyed although the process may have been aided by crustal warping 4 The place of the capture was near the junction of the Tallulah River with the Chat tooga and probably just below that junction 5 The falls of the Tallulah River while initially caused by the capture exist today because of a hard rock barrier crossed by the river but not yet worn down by it 6 The similar falls which must have exist ed on the Chattooga River have been obliter ated by that stream since the great lapse of time since the capture has been ample for it to grade its course in the less resistant rock over which it runs The Tallulah district is crossed from north east to southwest by the southwestern exten sion of the Blue Ridge escarpment which is from 500 to 600 feet high at this point The escarpment connects a higher with a lower peneplain both of which are eroded on folded crystallines the higher one sloping gently to ward the west the lower one gently toward the southeast The streams on the higher level flow in fairly mature valleys cut but slightly below the general surface In like manner the streams on the lower level flow in broad shallow valleys but their upper branches are working actively headward into the higher level thus pushing the escarpment backward to the northwest and capturing additional drainage areas from the rivers flowing on the surface well above them In striking contrast to these two classes of streams on the lower and upper levels respect ively is a drainage system cut down into the upper level This is the upper TugalooChat tooga River which flows in a deep gorge cut 500 feet or more below the upper level until it breaks from its gorge at the face of the escarpment and flows out over the lower level in a fairly mature valley Nothing could be more striking than the contrast between this young stream with its picturesque steepsided chasm cut in the upper level and the mature streams in broad open valleys flowing onw the upper and lower levels The Tallulah River first flows through low mountains on the upper level but when near its junction with the Chattooga suddenly plunges down into a gorge430 SCIENCE N S VOL XXV No 637 known locally as the grand chasm and so joins the drainage system which is cut so deeply into the upper level The rapid descent into the chasm is made by a series of falls and rapids known collectively as the Tallulah Falls In connection with this peculiar feature of the drainage is a striking drainage pattern The Chattooga River flows almost due south west until it is joined by the Tallulah and then turns abruptly at a right angle and under the names Tugaloo and Savannah Rivers flows almost due southeast into the Atlantic Near the point where this sharp bend or elbow occurs a stream on the upper level Deep Creek takes its rise and continues the south west line begun by the Chattooga until under the names Soque and Chattahoochee Rivers it reaches the gulf It is this assemblage of features which has suggested that the Chattooga River formerly flowed southwest into the gulf drainage being continuous with and forming the upper part of the Chattahoochee that one of the head water branches of the TugalooSavannah sys tem succeeded in eating headward into the escarpment so far that it undermined the valley of the ChattoogaChattahoochee some 500 or 600 feet above thus diverting the upper part of that system into the Atlantic drainage and causing it to flow down to the lower level and so on southeast to the ocean As a result of this capture falls and rapids would be es tablished where the descent from the higher older course down to the lower new course was made These falls would be gradually worn back leaving a young valley or gorge below them in the vicinity of the sharp bend or  elbow of capture where the stream changed from the southwest to the southeast course From the elbow of capture the re maining portion of the beheaded stream would continue its southwest course flowing in a more mature valley on the upper level The features in the Tallulah district are so striking and so typical that it seems difficult to account for them on any other basis than the theory of capture Certainly the condi tions are eminently favorable for capture and when one sees the streams on the lower level actively engaged in gnawing headward into the steep escarpment and thus under mining the upper level he feels a growing conviction that the streams on the upper level are in imminent danger of diversion So when he witnesses those features which must necessarily follow capture he is not at all surprised but adopts the theory of capture as a matter of course There are certain fea tures of the Tallulah district which have caused some doubt as to the efficiency of river capture and which therefore deserve special attention It would appear that if the cap ture is so recent that the stream has not yet had time to wear back the falls and rapids produced by capture then there should be falls in the Chattooga River as well as in the Tal lulah The former is no larger a stream than the latter and so far as volume goes no better fitted to grade its course Recency of capture therefore does not seem competent to explain the falls in the Tallulah when there are no corresponding falls in the Chattooga AMr Jones concluded that there was no differ ence in the resistance of the rocks over which the two streams ran and was therefore led to doubt the fact of capture and to suggest some other alternative Professor Davis believed that the topographic features indicated cap ture and in order to account for the falls in the Tallulah and their absence in the Chat tooga suggested that the former courses of the rivers might have been such that the Chat tooga was captured first and the Tallulah not until a later period thus giving more time for the reducing of the falls in one case than in the other After careful investigation it appears that the difficulty lies in the interpretation of the character of the rocks over which the two streams run Instead of sameness of char acter there is seen to be the most significant difference in composition and ability to with stand erosion and weathering The Chat tooga River flows over a mica schist which in all parts of the region is seen to offer little opposition to stream erosion Occasional more quartzose bands have determined the location of minor falls or rapids along the smaller branch streams but even these smallMARCH 15 1907 SCIENCE 431 branches of the deeply incised drainage ex cept in the case of the very smallest examples have eroded deep valleys in the mica schist On the other hand the Tallulah River is found to cross a resistant barrier of dense hard quartzite near its junction with the Chat tooga This rock is wholly distinct from the mica schist contains little else than fine quartz grains firmly cemented into a massive bluishgray quartzite It is less apt to be sheared than the other rocks of the region having to a great degree withstood the crush ing incident to regional metamorphism it weathers with difficulty and wherever present forms a serious obstacle to stream erosion even a small layer of it determining the site of falls on some of the branch streams A great thickness of this resistant rock is crossed by the lower course of the Tallulah A tra verse of several miles along the lower course of the Chattooga resulted in the finding of nothing but mica schist in the ledges and in the boulders in the stream bed so it seems apparent that this stream has not encountered any of this hard rock in its downcutting but is located wholly on the weaker mica schist The presence of the falls in the Tallulah River and their absence in the Chattooga now become perfectly intelligible When the cap ture occurred falls were produced which at once began to be worn back After retreating to the junction of the Tallulah and Chattooga Rivers two series of falls were formed one retreating up the course of the former river and one up the course of the latter The falls in the Chattooga were worn back to grade during the long period of time which has elapsed since the capture for the weak mica schist offered no great obstacle to the rivers attempt to grade its course The falls in the Tallulah have not been thus worn back since the hardrock barrier with which that stream had to contend has made the process of grading a very slow one a retreat of but a few miles having been accomplished thus far and the work still continuing very slowly under the extremely unfavorable conditions which prevail There are many direct evidences of river capture which have been obliterated during the long period of erosion since the capture occurred The former channel of the Chat tooga across the divide to the southwest cannot be seen stream dissection has been extensive and all traces of that channel itself have been removed The valley of the Chat tooga has been so widened that no bench or terrace remains to indicate the abrupt change from the former mature upland valley to the deeply incised gorge The lack of adjustment between the shrunken beheaded stream and the broad valley made to accommodate the former larger river has given place to a newly established adjustment The evidences of recent capture are lacking and everything points to a great lapse of time since the cap ture permitting the effacement of the more temporary effects of capture and a consider able degree of adjustment to the new order of things The evidences of remote capture however are none the less conclusive The theory of capture has been supported on the basis of certain facts in the distribu tion of the freshwater faunas It appears that a few shells from the Chattahoochee and more western drainage basins are found in the Savannah River while a number of forms from the Savannah system are found in the Chattahoochee system It is argued that these forms must have passed between the two sys tems at the time of capture That the fauna of the upper Chattahoochee the Chattooga River might be transferred into the Savannah River by the capture would appear quite possible It is much more diffi cult to account for the transfer in the opposite direction however if we limit ourselves to river capture as the means Yet the main transfer is supposed to have been in that direction That shells could have passed from the lower level of the Tugaloo up 500 or 600 feet over falls and rapids to the higher lexel of the Chattahoochee does not seem probable It is possible of course that the headwater portion of the capturing stream may have been a more even slope instead of a series of falls but the evidence of other streams work ing headward into the escarpment suggests that the capture was most probably initiated by a series of more or less prominent cata432 SCIENCE N S VOL XXV No 63T racts These would effectually prevent trans fer through the water itself Furthermore there is reason to believe that the transfer of water may have been nearly or quite com pleted before an actual surface valley con nection was formed since as Lane has pointed out leakage through the rocks from the higher to the lower level will go on for a long time possibly increasing until all of the water from the higher level passes under ground to the lower stream leaving a dry channel for some distance below the point of capture in the upper valley Under these cir cumstances it would be difficult to conceive of any transfer of faunas from the lower to the higher stream which was dependent upon direct freshwater communication On the other hand there are so many means for the dispersal of freshwater shells and the evi dence in other localities is so conclusive that they have been dispersed by such means that we may reasonlably suppose shells from either of the two systems might be transferred to the other independently of the capture For this reason I do not believe that the distribu tion of the shells can be urged as a proof of capture although the fact of capture is well attested by other lines of evidence The conclusion in favor of the theory of capture is further confirmed by the presence of old river gravels along the former south westward course of the Chattooga In view of the fact that the capture occurred at a remote period we should not expect to find the former channel preserved nor to find the gravels deposited by the river along that channel in their proper place The stream dissection which we have already seen de stroyed all traces of the former channel would also wash the gravels down the slopes of the growing ravines and valleys in many cases removing them altogether but possibly leaving remnants in specially favored spots on the slopes and in the valleys A careful search revealed the presence of these gravels usually as scattered pebbles and boulders on the hillsides but occasionally as considerable patches in the bottoms of small branch val leys There was no mistaking their char acter The present streamborne material even in the largest of these branches is quite angular and evidently of local origin The gravels are beautifully rounded quartz pebbles cobbles and boulders somewhat roughened where exposed to the weather for a long time but perfectly smooth where recently unearthed In one place they were so abundant that a farmer had made numerous large piles of them in an ineffectual attempt to clear a small plot of ground for agricultural purposes Their occurrence together with the unequivo cal topographic evidence would seem to re move the question of capture from the realm of theory and place it definitely in the realm of known facts DOUGLAS WILSON JOHNSON CAMBRIDGE MASS

j100000,Science,1642446,Kentucky as an Oil State,i296509,KENTUCKY AS AN OIL STATE AT the present writing June 1917 Ken tucky stands in the limelight as a prospective oil state Due to the fact that the Irvine Dis 12 Ann der Phys 39 789 1912 trict of Estill County has been extended over a large area together with the greatly renewed activity in the older Kentucky fields operators are now turning their attention to the state as a whole This is particularly true of oil men from the Midcontinent Field So it ap pears that the latter part of this year and the early months of 1918 will forever settle the question as to the states potential rank in the production of petroleum and natural gas Test wells are to be drilled in nearly every county in the state and the most modern ap plications of petroleum geology are being freely used Up to the present time most of the wild cat work has progressed only to the mapping or leasing state but the high standing of the companies interested is a good indicator of the developments that undoubtedly will follow There are four important geological factors that are always met in the search for new oil fields When all of them are found to work in harmony great fields like those of Oklahoma Kansas and Texas or those of Pennsylvania Ohio and West Virginia are the result Geo logical  structure such as anticlines domes etc constitute only one of these factors A large number of structures do not produce oil or gas They may or may not produce salt water Furthermore they may lie in what would be considered favorable regions In such cases the detail which may have been ex pended in mapping them is of no avail Such conditions result from failure of one or more of the three other factors namely either 1 there is no open sand or other porous medium under the structure to serve as a re tainer for oil and gas or 2 there has never been present any salt water or other water in the sand to serve as a concentrating factor that is no gathering of oil and gas from a disseminated state to a commercial body or 3 there is an absence of petroliferous shale or other fossilbearing rocks that produce oil in a disseminated form Now the future of Kentucky as an oil state depends on the four factors above mentioned 1 structure 2 sand 3 water 4 original oil There can be no question about the state SCIENCE 279N S VOL XLVI No 1186 having three of the above points in its favor namely 1 structure 2 water 3 original oil There are numerous favorable structural conditions in various counties of the state The rocks contain plenty of water and there are some good beds of oilbearing shale The Devonian Black Shale is particularly a splendid carrier of original oil The fourth factor is however as yet to be proved of sufficient im portance to place Kentucky in high rank as an oil state namely  sand In great oil fields there are large bodies of sand or retaining reservoirs in close proximity to beds of oil bearing shale There are frequently several such  sands  in the geological column in close relationships to oilshale beds In Kentucky the  sands  or  porous beds near the Devonian Oil Shale are carrying most of the oil so far discovered In Wayne County these sands lie in the Waverly series above the Black Shale but in other districts the oil is held below the shale in porous beds of lime stone This is true of the oil fields at Irvine Cannel City Campton Menefee County and other districts of eastern Kentucky In the coal basins of eastern Kentucky and western Kentucky there are a large number of beds of porous quartz sandstone they lie in the Chester and Pennsylvania series but in con nection with these sandstone beds oil shales must be proved to exist in order that any par ticular structure may be found productive If for instance a bed of oil shale like the Devonian Black Shale could be found just above or below the Big Clifty Sandstone at the base of the Chester then an anticline contain ing these beds at sufficient depth would most certainly make a big oil and gas field like those of Oklahoma but it so happens that in a great many cases in Kentucky the oil shales do not lie near dependable porous reservoir rocks or else the porous sandstones in the higher por tion of the geological column such as those above enumerated do not have near them any great amount of typical oil shale In conclusion the writer desires to state it as his opinion that Kentucky is not to rank high as an oil state in comparison with many other areas in the United States where the four factors work in harmony and there are numerous porous sands near beds of oil shale however the writer wishes to emphasize the probability that a number of structures in Kentucky will find the four factors working together and will furnish new oil pools that will be highly valuable to those who are for tunate enough to discover them Careful studies by geologists working in the state will serve to gather a great deal of im portant information in addition to merely mapping suitable structural conditions in any particular locality JAMES H GARDNER TULSA OKLA

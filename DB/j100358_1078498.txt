Education University of Chicago General survey of art needs in lifeStudents of education are demanding more than ever before that definite objectives which meet the real needs of the pupil be determined in all subjects of the public school and that subjectmatter be incorporated into the curriculum which will meet these objectives In order to satisfy this demand in the field of art education it is necessary first to make a careful survey of the art needs in the home in the com munity in industry and in life in general It then becomes neces sary to determine what phases of these needs can be met by art training in the public school An analysis of the present demands for art viewed in terms of national social and industrial efficiency reveals the fact that there are several quite distinct but nevertheless closely interwoven forms of art service needed in American life I THE INDUSTRIAL SERVICE a Better quality in designThere is a demand at the present time more than in any other period of our national history for a greater number of better and more skilled designers in America Better commercial design in all our industrial products is neces sary to enable our manufacturers to compete successfully in the placing of their goods upon the markets of the world Eliminating the factors of technical quality and price the essential selling feature of goods of all kinds is their attractiveness through superior design Before the worldwar there existed keen competition between Great Britain France and Germany in respect to the artistic quality of their manufactured products Many efficient industrial art schools were established in these and other European countries to meet the trade demands in regard to 757758 THE SCHOOL REVIEW December art quality Since the close of the war we hear of the establish ment ofmany additional schools of arts and crafts and of design and industrial art That European peoples will do this in spite of the trying situation of reconstruction in which they find themselves proves the faith they have in their art as a national requisite Paris has set the standard of fashion for many years English French and German china has outsold American china even in our own markets Oriental silks rugs tapestries etc have held preference to similar American products due to the design quality they possess American manufacturers in some instances have demonstrated that this state of affairs is unwarranted Its con tinuance will be due to the failure of America to meet the problem through adequate schools for the training of designers Art courses in the public schools aid in this respect by providing a means of discovering and conserving art talent and so directing it that it will be of value to the nation Art is needed in industry to provide for better quality of design as a selling factor to avoid economic waste and to provide for more lasting enjoyment appreciation and satisfaction from the article to be sold The contemplation of quality remains long after the price is forgotten is a term used discreetly in advertising certain merchandise An object lacking art quality in its true sense appropriateness simplicity grace and refine ment soon fails to satisfy a new purchase is made before the serviceability of the object has been exhausted Hence from objects of this character there is waste in production waste in purchasing ability and waste in satisfaction and enjoyment b Originality and distinctiveness in American industrial design An American style of design is needed to give our manufactured products a distinctive place among the products of the world This does not mean that we should reject all good art of foreign peoples but that we must use foreign productions in developing our own art in such a way that it will not result in cheap imitation inappropriate and inconsistent motives and meaningless ornament We must do away with promiscuous copying and stealing of foreign ideas What we need is an American spirit in our art characteristic of our great national life environment and tradiX920 DETERMINING AIMS OF ART INSTRUCTION 759 tions We need art created in America and reflecting American ideals not those of Persia Greece Japan or any other foreign country Training in art in the public school will contribute much toward the bettering of American industrial art if it makes use of the wealth of distinctively American motives as a basis for problems and exercises II FINE ARTS SERVICE a Production of painting sculpture and architectureThere is needed better art training for the specialist the artist the pro ducer of the fine arts the landscape painter and painter of por traits the sculptor and the architect The fine arts contribute directly through visual instruction to science history literature and the tradition and culture sur rounding our national life They interpret the life of the past as well as of the present they picture the hopes and aspirations of the future The fine arts are a national asset b Art for culture appreciation of the fine artsIn the minds of many people there is a desire for familiarity with the fine arts as a purely cultural acquisition Such knowledge includes a history of the evolution of the arts and a critical survey of the works of art of all periods It involves a study of the lives of individual artists and a knowledge of the times the conditions and the spirit that fostered the art This type of art knowledge of cul tural value lays the foundation for the appreciation of the arts It is a phase of art understanding of value to the artist and to all people interested in the evolution and development of art III CIVIC DOMESTIC AND SOCIAL SERVICE There is need on the part of the public for good taste and artistic appreciation based upon a sound knowledge of those art principles which may be used in connection with ordinary things of common everyday life The supplying of this need is produc tive of greater contentment and satisfaction in surroundings and environment Attractive houses assist in the housing problem Beautiful city parks and environs tend to check unrest and migra tion The government has recognized this fact and is setting aside beautiful landscapes forests and parks as national assets Leaders760 THE SCHOOL REVIEW December of industry are using art as never before in attempting to interest their workers in their surroundings Better taste and enlightenment in regard to art quality which can be applied to common materials of everyday life result in increased capacity for enjoyment A type of art knowledge which assists in the problems of dress the home and the community has a double reaction for good It produces a demand for better products on the part of the people This demand in turn stimu lates manufacturers to produce goods of better artistic quality to meet the public taste Hence both consumer and producer may be encouraged to work together to raise the artistic standards in all things The democratizing of art also results in a direct benefit to art Art has always made its greatest progress when it has been most closely connected with the everyday needs of the human race IV ART FOR SELFEXPRESSION Drawing is recognized as a valuable means of supplementing expression in the written and spoken word Indeed drawing understood by nations with differing languages often becomes a more universal means of expression than language itself Strangers in a foreign country ignorant of the language must fall back upon gesture and drawing for communication In this respect at present our drawing courses make no large contribution they leave the average person with a very limited and hazy graphic vocabulary Graphic expression through the cartoon has great influence upon public opinion Evidence of this is found in the important part played by the cartoon during the worldwar and by the promi nence given to it by all modern newspapers A certain amount of practical drawing ability as an aid to expression is of great advantage in many occupations and pro fessions Descriptive diagrammatic and analytical drawing aid greatly in the accumulation and recording of knowledge in the sciences Drawing is of great value in constructive processes as an aid to the preliminary thinking necessary for designing or originating an object Nearly a decade ago President Eliot of Harvard made the follow ing statement at an educational conference I have examined all1920 DETERMINING AIMS OF ART INSTRUCTION 761 the courses offered by the university and I find but one the sub ject of theology in which a knowledge of drawing would not be of immediate value V GENERAL EDUCATIONAL VALUES In addition to the subjectmatter taught art work like other subjects in the school when properly presented aids in the develop ment of special mental processes and bodily reactions valuable to the pupil It aids in the promotion of better coordination of mind hand and eye development by doing and thinking through action By providing training in constructive analysis it stimu lates specific types of observation originality invention and initiative it increases the power of visualization aiding in the capacity of seeing things before they really exist It increases knowledge and understanding of the fine works of man and gives insight into a phase of nature not incorporated in the natural sciences ie the beauty of nature In general the training sup plied by art work is similar in scope to that of literature and music namely training in composition expression and appreciation There is also an avocational phase of art Many people obtain much enjoyment and pleasure from drawing sketching composi tion in photography and other forms of art work as a sort of recre ation or hobby This may be thought of as a byproduct and need not be considered on a par with the other needs for art THE PROBLEM OF ART EDUCATION IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL Very few people will question the importance of the develop ment of all these phases of art in our American life Students of education however justly criticize the tendency of some art 1 If a pupil is trained in the ability to see in plants grace and refinement of line and is taught to adapt such lines to the designing of furniture possessing refined and graceful lines he will be more observant of fine lines in nature and in furniture If a pupil is given the ability to see and analyze beautiful color harmonies in the plumage of birds in plants and all nature and is taught to produce similar harmonies in rugs and textiles he will observe more keenly the beauties of color in nature and in rugs and textiles Similar analogies may be made for all practical problems in art Such knowledge equips the pupil with initiative in the use of line form tone color and their arrangement as adapted to dress home furnishings and problems of design and construction wherever they may be encountered Many problems in art work require the creation of original units and forms or the adaptation of familiar forms in original ways Such training aids in imagination originality and invention762 THE SCHOOL REVIEW December educators in attempting to crowd all of the art activities into the public school All workers in the field of art education are more or less guilty of endeavoring to teach all of the phases of art as efectively as possible in the public school without first determining the essential of art appropriate to the public school What we need in our art litera ture is not  new ideas from everywhere but essentials of art for the public school from art supervisors and teachers who are students of education When we canvass the history of art education in this country we find that it has been exploited by commercial houses with sys tems to sell or supplies to market it has often been taken over by followers of fads and nicknacks it has fluctuated frequently from one extreme to the other from the fine arts on the one hand to the industrial or practical arts on the other The result has been that the fundamental purpose of art education in the public school at times has been nearly submerged by the multitudes of passing fashions of art teaching Substance is needed in our art work not mere eyeattracting superficialities The great question which confronts the public school is what phases of the fundamental art needs should be cultivated by the school  It is evident that the public school cannot in the limited part of the pupils life apportioned in the school equip the pupil to any great extent with practical ability in all phases of art It could not do so even if more time were allowed for this purpose than is now generally given to the subject of art education In general public schools do not attempt to give all pupils the broad type of art training needed for the art specialist To do so under the circumstances would be to disregard the principles of efficiency especially when we consider the many essentials which are to be taught to the child in order to equip him for life The comparatively short sojourn of the pupil within the school and the limited amount of time at his disposal for the study of different subjects constitute one factor of great significance in considering the relative importance value and time element of the various school subjects We must know the place of our subject in relaZ920 DETERMINING AIMS OF ART INSTRUCTION 763 tion to the other subjects and must so conduct our work that it will be in harmony and not in discord with the general purpose of the school and the advancement of education in general OBJECTIVES AND PLAN FOR COURSE OF STUDY IN ART FOR THE SECONDARY SCHOOL Art in the high schoolIn the high school art work has been quite generally elective Those pupils who have special talent or special desire to study art elect to do so Courses should be pro vided to aid such pupils in every way possible If it is found that such courses cannot offer in the limited time given them the necessary amount of training to make pupils competent to enter directly into the art professions including industrial arts then the courses should at least give them as good a foundation as is possible under the circumstances This is the case in science law and medicine Students from highschool departments are not expected to go into these professions without further training The high schools can equip their pupils with a good art foundation upon which to build when they enter upon the definite specialized train ing to be followed in the art or technical school In addition to courses in art for pupils of special talent and in close cooperation with them courses should be given dealing with the study of the art of the past and its interpretation This type of art training aiding greatly in the matter of appreciation and possessing a cultural phase can become in the high school a course in itself for those who wish to elect it Also greatly needed in the high school is a type of art course adapted to the needs of those students who do not intend to become artists or specialists in art but who wish to gain information knowledge and understanding pertaining to art work for its general benefit to them in life Almost all highschool pupils need more art training than has been supplied to them by the art courses of the elementary schools This training should be of a practical nature general not specific in scope full of functional informa tion and suited to the everyday art needs of life Such a course should be organized and become a required study during the first year of the high school764 THE SCHOOL REVIEW December In order to care better for the great majority of pupils in the high school who need more art knowledge and understanding to fit them for life but who do not expect to follow art work professionally and in order to differentiate between such pupils and those pupils who desire to take up specialized training in art as a foundation for a profession the art courses of the high school should be divided into three types of courses i general art course required 2 special art courses elective 3 course in the historical survey of art elective The general art courseThis course would continue the work of the elementary school broadened and extended to meet the more advanced and mature status of the pupil It should aim to equalize the training of pupils coming into the high school from various elementary schools where the art work may have been superficial in nature In addition to its main purpose of equipping the pupil with a good sound knowledge and understanding of art this course should build up a foundation in the fundamentals of art which will enable pupils later to enter the specialized courses with approximately the same training and skill In such a course the art work should be taken by all pupils alike as part of the regular process of education Since the art work here is not elective as in the later courses of the high school it must of neces sity be such as to meet primarily the demands of the great majority of pupils and not the few of special talent It is evident that good taste and artistic appreciation are qualities needed alike by both artist and artisan by both pro ducers and consumers of art quality by the industries making objects and material and by the people who use and purchase such material Hence a type of art training which will develop this ability may justly become one objective of a general art course required of all pupils Moreover it is desirable that all people have sufficient drawing ability to express ideas clearly and possess the added advantage to be secured from a practical use of this ability Hence a certain amount of skill in drawing is desirable and becomes a legitimate objective of such a course I See  CurriculumBuilding in Art for the Elementary School course of study based upon line form tone color and composition Elementary School Journal XXI December 19201920 DETERMINING AIMS OF ART INSTRUCTION 765 A limited appreciation of art and a limited art knowledge can be built up without training in technical proficiency and skill in artistic interpretation However appreciation and art knowl edge can be developed more effectively and quickly and they will have a more definite background if developed through actual practice in producing art quality and by clear recognition of the relation between appreciation and actual production For this reason the general art course should include the elements of crea tive and constructive design and the elements of design as applied to arrangement of materials and objects to produce artistic effects in interior decorations dress house planning community projects etc See Outline i A pupil will obtain more understanding and appreciation from exercises by which he actually participates in creative effort in connection with the material of his surroundings than is possible for him to obtain from formal abstract exercises with no practical result In the former case he will have entered into the experi ence with a tangible interest while in the latter he must adjust himself to foreign material of a superficial environment In order to undertake creative work in art of any great value it is first necessary that the pupil be able to draw Drawing thus has two values first as a means of graphic expression inde pendent of other forms of art and second as a foundation for design construction and creative art work SummaryWe must have in mind all of the phases of art out lined at the beginning of the discussion when building a course of study for the public school but we must realize that a radically different type of art work is needed to meet the objectives for the great mass of pupils who take art in a general way in the school from that needed to train the relatively small percentage of pupils of special talent who elect the specialized art courses of the school We must not confuse the problem of training of specialists with the general problem of art education The twofold aims of art in the public school have been kept in mind in developing the following synopsis material This may be used in organizing the course of study in art in the high school so as to provide for the needs of the two distinct groups of pupils766 THE SCHOOL REVIEW December Outline I is offered as an aid in planning the general art course Further details in

below the high school and that the com plete fulfilment of the objectives set up by such a survey is beyond the scope of the average secondary school In order to carry out such a comprehensive program a different type of school from the high school is necessary This work is being done in a few parts of the country by industrial art schools Such schools are in existence at Philadelphia Pa Providence RI Grand Rapids Mich and Newark and Trenton NJ with a few schools for special industries and several schools offering a few courses in industrial art in other parts of the country especially in the east Many more industrial art schools are needed to meet the industrial demands of this country In preparing the way for this type of school the public school can accomplish a valuable service by pro viding art instruction of a fundamental nature for pupils desiring to enter upon special training  In this connection read Industrial Art a National Asset Industrial Education Circular No 3 May I919

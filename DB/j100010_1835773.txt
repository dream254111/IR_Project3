EMBERS of the American Historical Association expect to find at the beginning of the April number of this journal an account of the transactions of the annual meeting of the Associa tion customarily held in the last days of December preceding and with it certain items of formal matter relating to the meeting such as the text of important votes passed by the Association or the Executive Council a summary of the treasurers report an exhibit of the budget or estimated receipts and expenditures or appropria tions and a list of the officers of the Association and of the various committees appointed by the Executive Council The thirtyfourth annual meeting which was to have taken place at Cleveland on December 27 and 28 was indefinitely postponed on account of a strong recommendation received from the health officer of that city a few days before the date on which the meeting should have taken place that it should be omitted because of the epidemic of influenza then prevailing in Cleveland Yet though there is no annual meeting to chronicle in these pages it will be convenient to members that the formal matter spoken of above should be found in its customary place Moreover though no meeting of the Asso ciation has taken place there was a meeting of the Executive Council held in New York on January 3I and February I I919 some of the transactions of which analogous to those of the Asso ciation in its annual business meeting may here for convenience be described In a few cases the text of votes passed is printed in an appendix to the present article The Council met at Columbia University with the president Mr William R Thayer in the chair Three expresidents of the Association Andrew D White Henry Adams and Theodore Roose velt and A Howard Clark who for thirty years had served the Association in the successive offices of assistant secretary secretary AM HIST REV VOL XXIV24 349350 American Historical Association and curator having died since the last meeting

of 25I9 as against an enrollment of 2654 on December I9 I9I7 and of 2739 on the same date in I9I6 A summary of the annual report of the treas urer Mr Charles Moore is presented in an appendix to these pages Invitations from Cleveland and Minneapolis for the annual meeting of I9I9 were before the Council It voted on account of the special conditions resulting from the war which seemed to make a central meetingplace desirable to hold the meeting in Cleveland in the concluding days of December I919 No action was taken respecting the place of meeting for I920 The omission of the annual meeting in I918 does not carry with it the omission of the annual report for that year The act of in corporation requiring the presentation of an annual report to the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution provision was made for a volume which will contain the usual formal records of the Asso ciation or so many of them as have been made together with materials supplied by some of the various commissions and com mittees The Historical Manuscripts Commission which reported through its chairman Dr Justin H Smith purposes to print in that report a body of correspondence of Santa Anna of the period of the war between the United States and Mexico It is planned that the annual report for I919 shall contain a large selection edited for the commission by Professor Robert P Brooks of the University of Georgia from the letters to John C Calhoun pre served among his papers at Clemson College After this the com mission expects to print a large selection probably three volumes of the papers of Stephen F Austin edited by Professor Eugene C Barker These proposals were authorized by the Council In the case of the Public Archives Commission which has nearly completed its round of activities in connection with theAmnerican Historical Association 35I archives of the several states provision was made for deliberation by Mr Paltsits and his associates upon a new programme of work The committee on bibliography Professor George M Dutcher chairman reported that the Bibliography of American Travel is nearly ready for publication this committee was charged also with the preparation in conjunction with the American Library Asso ciation of a manual serving the same purposes mutatis mutandis whiclh C K Adamss Manual of Historical Literature was designed to serve in its generation The report of the board of editors of the American Historical Review was presented by its chairman Professor Edward P Cheyney who at a later point in the proceed ings was reelected a member of the board for the period of six years now beginning The Justin Winsor Prize under the  new rules which admit printed as well as manuscript essays to the com petition was awarded to Professor Arthur M Schlesinger of the Ohio State University for his essay entitled The Colonial Merchants in the American Revolution I763I776 printed as volume LXXVIII of the Columbia University Studies in History Eco nomics and Public Law The committee appointed a year ago on the representation of the Association in the historical congress to be held in Rio de Janeiro in I922 was authorized to take appropriate measures to secure governmental recognition and a Congressional appropriation sufficient to insure for the United States adequate representation at the congress Provision was made for reconsidering the relations between the Association and the journal conducted by Professor A E McKinley hitherto known as the History Teachers Magazine but now called the Historical Outlook and for considering any method that it may be practicable to adopt for continuing in time of peace as far as is possible the services now performed to the government and the public by the National Board for Historical Service One particular activity of that board was immediately taken over by the Association namely its effort to prepare a report on the study of history in all schools of less than college grade which shall result in the better adaptation of curricula and methods both in respect to history and in respect to education for citizenship to the exigencies brought upon the country by the Great War American experience of that conflict has brbught home forcibly to many minds the need of better adjustment of the school work in these lines to the changed conditions of the nation and the world His torical training with its ability to induce openmindedness patient352 American Historical Association inquiry and sound judgment respecting human relations its em phasis on the idea of social development its power of evoking loy alty to principles and institutions by revealing the cost at which the elements of civilization have been secured offers the best means by which the school can achieve that better adjustment can equip the young American citizen with fuller knowledge and understanding of the nations and the worlds affairs Educators generally recognize that the war has definitely estab lished recent and contemporaneous history as indispensable features in the history courses of the future and that the curriculum needs to be remade in order that time may be found for these new and compelling interests Upon request by the National Education Association the National Board for Historical Service had in December appointed five gentlemen Messrs S B Harding W C Bagley F S Bogardus J A C Chandler and D C Knowlton a committee to prepare a report on the subject Upon report of these proceedings and upon request by the Board the Council voted to substitute for its committee on history in schools a special com mittee consisting of the five members already named together with Professors G S Ford A C McLaughlin and Joseph Schafer and to instruct this committee to prepare as soon as possible a report on the changes and readjustments which should be made in the study and teaching of history and civics in all schools elementary sec ondary rural vocational etc below the grade of college Mr Schafer has since become chairman of this important committee and invites correspondence I I40 Woodward Building Washington D C from teachers and others interested in its problems and endeavors After preliminary meetings in Washington and New York this Committee on History and Education for Citizenship in the Schools held a meeting in Chicago on February 28 supplemented by a help ful conference with a representative group of educators of the Mid dle West It hopes to make such supplementary conferences a con stant or frequent accompaniment to its meetings As its most urgent problem the committee will study the ques tion of the history courses in the high school and it will prepare a careful report on a first year of history and a second year of his tory in the high school the former to be a course in modern his tory the latter a course in the history of the United States In respect to historical work in the common schools the com mittee accepts the report of the former Committee of Eight of the American Historical Association as a basis but expects to studyAmerican Historical Association 353 that report with a view to adjusting its recommendations to the new situation which would result from a recasting of the high school work and with a view to making other improvements which may seem advisable and practicable One suggested change is to strengthen the sixthgrade history devoted to the European back ground of American history in order to make it serve as an intro duction to the modern history course in the high school as well as to the course in American history given in the seventh and eighth grades and to dignify it by making it a basis of promotion as is the history of the upper two years In the outlining of courses the committee will seek to avoid the evils that flow from repetition in one course of material already traversed in a course preceding In their forthcoming report which they hope to complete by June they expect to consider meth ods of teaching and not merely curricula to present specimen les sons and to lay greater emphasis than has heretofore been custo mary upon significant ideas and interpretations as opposed to a multiplicity of unrelated facts Perhaps the only other transaction of the Council of general interest to the members of the Association apart from those items whose text is given below was a vote authorizing the Council com mittee on finance to associate with itself seven additional members for the specific purpose of increasing the endowment fund of the Association This work begun by Mr Bowen in the last months of his treasurership but suspended on account of the entrance of the United States into the war is now expected to be actively resumed it is to be earnestly hoped that it will meet with great success and that members of the Association will interest them selves warmly both in contributing and in securing contributions Every historical student every friend of learning in America ought to bear constantly in mind the peculiar position with respect to the support of the higher sort of studies in which the United States is left at the close of the Great War While every European nation has suffered enormous pecuniary losses the plain fact is though it is not a fact of which we need be proud that America has suffered very little no more at any rate than in a brief period will be overbalanced by the energizing of our economic methods and of a million or more of our young men Relatively to that of Europe our situation is one of affluence Surely this brings its duties The springs from which European public enterprises of science and of high scholarship have been fed have been largely dried up It will for a long time be utterly impossible for European governments to354 AmZericant Historical Association spend as much money in sustaining learned publications and re searches as they have spent in the past It is for America to step into the breach It is not necessary f or us to claim a primacy in scholarship which we have not yet achieved though we ought to do our best to achieve it but we may well seek a primacy in expenditure for learned undertakings both international and national may well re solve to take a far larger part in sustaining the worlds scholarship than we have hitherto taken may well make our best endeavors that the American Historical Association our chief organization for the furtherance of historical learning may have ample means for the support and conduct of a wide variety of laudable enter prises both those which will specially advance historical scholarship in America and those which will be useful alike to us and to the historians of burdened Europe Have the elder races halted Do they droop and end their lesson wearied over there beyond the seas  We take up the task eternal and the burden and the lesson Pioneers 0 pioneers VOTES OF THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL Voted That any

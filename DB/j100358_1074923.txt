J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1074923,GREEK AND LATIN IN THE HIGHER SCHOOLS OF GERMANY II,I244489,GREEK AND LATIN IN THE HIGHER SCHOOLS OF GERMANY II IT WILL BE APPARENT TO READERS OF THIS PAPER THAT IT IS NO SIMPLE TASK TO DESCRIBE THE INSTRUCTION IN GREEK AND LATIN OF THE GERMAN SCHOOLS THE PRESENT IS A PERIOD OF TRANSITION UNCERTAINTY AND CONFUSION ARE TO BE FOUND IN MOST SCHOOLS AND NOT A FEW TEACHERS OPENLY ASSERT THEIR DISDAIN OF THE NEW ORDER AND EXPRESS A DETERMINATION TO CLING TO THEIR OLD METHODS TILL THE CURRICULUM SHALL AGAIN BE REVISED UNIFORMITY IN METHOD OR IN SCOPE OF WORK CANNOT BE EXPECTED UNTIL TIME SHALL REMOVE OR HARMONIZE THE MULTIPLICITY OF DISTURBING ELEMENTS THE OFFICIAL SYLLABUS ALLOWS CONSIDERABLE FREEDOM OF CHOICE IN THE MATTER OF TEXTBOOKS AND SUBJECTMATTER FOR THIS REASON ONE RARELY FINDS PRECISELY THE SAME WORK BEING DONE AT A GIVEN TIME EVEN IN THE SCHOOLS OF THE SAME CITY THEN TOO THERE IS A VARIATION FROM YEAR TO YEAR IN THE SELECTIONS FROM THE LITERATURE IN ORDER TO AVOID REPETITION FOR PUPILS SET BACK THE PLAN GIVES ZEST TO THE TEACHERS WORK AS WELL IN GIVING THE COURSE OF STUDY FOR A PARTICULAR SCHOOL IT SHOULD BE BORNE IN MIND THAT IT CAN AT BEST BE ONLY A TYPE NO OTHER SCHOOL MAY BE DOING PRECISELY THE SAME WORK THE DIFFERENCES HOWEVER ARE OF MINOR CONSEQUENCE FOR PURPOSES OF ILLUSTRATION I PRESENT HEREWITH AN OUTLINE OF THE WORK DONE LAST YEAR IN LATIN AND GREEK IN THE STDDTISCHES GYMNASIUM FRANKFORTONTHEMAIN THIS SCHOOL IS NOTED NOT ONLY FOR THE EXCELLENCE OF ITS CLASSICAL WORK BUT ALSO FOR ITS GENERAL PROGRESSIVE SPIRIT IN I894 WHEN I VISITED THE SCHOOL IT HAD ABOUT SIX HUNDRED PUPILS IN NINETEEN CLASSES UNDER THIRTYTWO TEACHERS IN REALITY HOWEVER THERE ARE TWO SCHOOLS OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED PUPILS EACH UNITED IN NAME AND UNDER ONE GENERAL MANAGEMENT BUT ESSENTIALLY DISTINCT IN INTERNAL ARRANGEMENT AND METHODS OF WORK THE PROGRAMME 664GREEK AND LATIN IN THE HIGHER SCHOOLS OF GERMANY 665 GIVEN BELOW IS FROM THE

TO THE THOUGHTCONTENT INTELLECTUAL AESTHETIC AND MORAL IN ALL CLASSICAL STUDY IS EVERYWHERE APPARENT IN THE NEW PROGRAMME IT DECIDES WHAT AUTHORS ARE TO BE READ AND THE RELATIVE WORTH OF EACH IT GIVES A NEW VIEWPOINT FOR ESTIMATING THE VALUE OF GRAMMATICAL RULES COMPOSITION AND THE ORAL USE OF THE CLASSIC TONGUES PUPILS ARE TO STUDY LATIN AND GREEK NOT FOR A MENTAL DISCIPLINE WHICH WILL ENABLE THEM TO SOLVE ANY INTELLECTUAL TASK NO MATTER HOW DIFFICULT OR DISAGREEABLE BUT FOR THE PURPOSE OF BRINGING INTO THEIR LIVES THE NOBLEST AND BEST INFLUENCES OF THE SPIRITUAL LIFE OF CLASSIC ANTIQUITY THE ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND AND INTERPRET THE LITERATURE RATHER THAN FACILITY IN USING THE LANGUAGE IS THE CHIEF END IT IS THIS VIEW EMPHASIZED SO STRONGLY IN THE CONFERENCE OF I890 THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PRESENT UNCERTAINTY IN METHODS OF TEACHING LATIN AND GREEK EACH TEACHER WHO ACCEPTS THE DICTUM OF THE GOVERNMENT IS OBLIGED PERFORCE TO READJUST HIS METHODS TO THE NEW CONDITIONS FORMAL GRAMMAR IS RULED OUT THE LATIN ESSAY IS BANISHED COMPOSITION IN LATIN AND GREEK MAY NO LONGER BE PRACTICED FOR THE SAKE OF STYLE NO TIME IS ALLOWED FOR DRILL IN SPEAKING LATIN CICERO THE LATINIST IS DETHRONED AND CICERO THE STATESMAN AND MORALIST EXALTED IN HIS STEAD NO WONDER THE SCHOLAR OF OTHER DAYS SEES ONLY RUIN AHEAD HIS IDOLS HAVE FALLEN AND WITH THEM HIS HOPE FOR THE FUTURE A GENERALLY ACCEPTED NORM IN METHODS THEREFORE CANNOT BE FOUND NOT A FEW TEACHERS DISDAINFUL OF THE NEWFANGLED NOTIONS AND DEVOTEDLY LOYAL TO THAT FORM OF TRAINING WHICH HAS CREATED FOR THEM A SECOND MOTHERTONGUE HOLD TO THE PEDAGOG ICAL OMNIPOTENCE OF THE LATIN LANGUAGE THE MAN THAT EXERCISES HIS INTELLECT IT IS CLAIMED IN THINKING WRITING AND SPEAKING LATIN BECOMES THEREBY TWICE A MAN WITH THIS CLASS OF TEACHERS MEMORY IS THE DOMINANT FACULTY AND METHODS OF INSTRUCTION ARE CHIEFLY DESIGNED TO EXERCISE THIS FACULTY REPETITION IS THE MEANS TO THE END THERE IS ANOTHER CLASS OF TEACHERS WHO ACCEPT THE NEW DOCTRINE THEORETICALLY BUT FOR LACK OF ADAPTABILITY ARE PRACTICALLY UNABLE TO LIFT THEMSELVES OUT OF THE OLD RUTS THEY DO AS THEY ALWAYS HAVE DONE BUT HOPE FOR DIFFERENT RESULTS 668GREEK AND LATIN IN THE HIGHER SCHOOLS OF GERMANY 669 LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THEMSELVES AND WANT OF ABILITY TO ADAPT NIEANS TO ENDS LIMIT THEIR SUCCESS THERE ARE TEACHERS HOWEVER MANY OF THEMWHO KNOWING WHAT IS WANTED AND HEARTILY SYMPATHIZING WITH ITS OBJECTS THROW THEMSELVES UNRESERVEDLY INTO THE WORK OF ESTABLISHING ORDER AMIDST THE PREVAILING CONFUSION IT IS THIS PARTY I BELIEVE THAT REPRESENTS THE LATEST AND WHAT BIDS FAIR EVENTUALLY TO BECOME THE PREVAILING MODE OF THOUGHT THEIR PRACTICE VARIED AS IT IS AT PRESENT TENDS TOWARDS UNIFORMITY ALONG CERTAIN LINES THESE LINES I SHALL ATTEMPT TO FOLLOW THE SUBJECT MATTER OF INSTRUCTION IN ALL CLASSES IS SELECTED WITH A VIEW TO ITS THOUGHTCONTENT RATHER THAN AS A MEANS OF EXERCISING THE LINGUISTIC FACULTY FORMS AND EXPRESSIONS OF RARE OCCURRENCE ARE AVOIDED THE LOGICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE LAN GUAGE WHILE NOT PUT PROMINENTLY FORWARD BY WAY OF GRAMMAT ICAL FORMULE IS NEVERTHELESS NOT NEGLECTED AT THE BEGINNING THE TEACHER PRONOUNCES A LATIN SENTENCE TRANSLATES IT WRITES IT ON THE BOARD THE CLASS READS IT AND GIVES THE GERMAN EQUIVA LENT AT FIRST SINGLY AND LATER IN CONCERT A SERIES OF SUCH SEN TENCES ARE LEARNED GIVING SEVERAL FORMS OF THE FIRST DECLENSION NEXT FOLLOWS THE EXPLANATION OF CASE ENDINGS OF FAMILIAR WORDS AND DRILL ON THE COMPLETE DECLENSION THE SAME PLAN IS FOLLOWED IN THE MATTER OF CONJUGATION ALL THE TIME AVOIDING IRREGULAR AND UNCOMMON FORMS PARADIGMS ARE THUS BUILT UP AND FOR EACH FORM THE PUPIL HAS A SENTENCE AT COMMAND THE SAME HOLDS TRUE OF RULES OF SYNTAX BY INDUCTION THE RULE IS FORMULATED AND FOR ILLUSTRATION OF ITS USE SEVERAL EXAMPLES ARE ALREADY AT HAND FURTHER A CAREFUL RECORD IS KEPT OF EACH NEW WORD AS IT OCCURS THUS VOCABULARY FORMS AND SYNTAX KEEP EVEN PACE DURING THE FIRST THREE YEARS THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE IN METHOD TEACHERS ARE OFTEN PROMOTED WITH THEIR CLASSES IN ORDER TO AVOID ALL POSSIBLE DISTURBING INFLUENCES IN TIME SHORT DETACHED SEN TENCES GIVE WAY TO CONNECTED DISCOURSE A TEXTBOOK IS DEPENDED UPON FOR NEW MATERIAL MORE AND MORE TIME IS GIVEN TO ORAL AND WRITTEN TRANSLATION INCESSANT DRILL AND REPETITION OFTEN CON DUCTED WITH SURPRISING RAPIDITY ARE THE MEANS EMPLOYED TO7HE SCHOOL REVIEW FASTEN IT IN THE PUPILS MIND AND ASIDE FROM A WELLLEARNED VOCABULARY FORMS AND RULES OF SYNTAX THE METHOD FAMILIARIZES THE PUPIL WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF COMMON PHRASES WHICH ENABLE HIM EVEN IN QUARTA TO RETRANSLATE SENTENCES INTO LATIN WITH SUR PRISING SKILL NEPOS IS READ AT SIGHT AS IT WOULD BE CALLED IN MOST AMERICAN SCHOOLS NEW WORDS AND CONSTRUCTIONS ARE EXPLAINED BY THE TEACHER THE REST MUST BE DONE BY THE PUPILS IN CLASS HOME STUDY FOR WHICH ONLY ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES ARE ALLOWED IS MAINLY GIVEN TO WRITING UP THE NOTEBOOK OR REVIEW ING A BIT OF TRANSLATION ALREADY DONE IN CLASS ONE POINT DESERVES NOTICE HERE WHEREAS THE INDUCTIVE METHOD IS IN HIGH FAVOR WITH THE BEST CLASSICAL TEACHERS THEY DO NOT SO FAR AS I KNOW EVER GO TO THE LENGTH OF DEPENDING UPON SOME STANDARD TEXT FOR ALL THE MATERIAL USED IN THE INTRODUCTORY COURSE TWO REASONS ARE URGED IN THE FIRST PLACE NEPOS MUCH MORE THEN CESAR OR XENOPHON GIVES TOO MANY IRREGULAR AND UNUSUAL FORMS FOR THE BEGINNER AND BESIDES SUCH AN AUTHOR DOES NOT FACILITATE THE BUILDING UP OF A SYMMETRICAL BODY OF GRAMMAT ICAL KNOWLEDGE AND WITHOUT A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF GRAM MATICAL FORMS AND PRINCIPLES NO FOREIGN LANGUAGE CAN BE LEARNED FROM A FEW RECITATIONS A WEEK HENCE LATIN FOR BEGINNERS MUST BE LATIN WRITTEN OR SELECTED FOR THE PURPOSE SOME SCHOOLS JENA FOR EXAMPLEUSE LATIN STORIES WRITTEN EXPRESSLY FOR CLASS USE A COMMONER PRACTICE HOWEVER IS TO MAKE SELECTIONS FROM STANDARD AUTHORS ELIMINATING UNDESIRABLE PARTS CAREFUL EDITING WILL WITH FEW CHANGES GIVE A CONTINUOUS NARRATIVE WHICH IS GEN ERALLY PREFERRED AFTER THE FIRST FEW WEEKS RETROVERSION SOCALLED IS AN EXERCISE MUCH USED IN ALL GRADES ONE PUPIL READS A LATIN SENTENCE SLOWLY ANOTHER REPEATS IT WITH BOOK CLOSED A THIRD TRANSLATES IT A FOURTH PUTS IT AGAIN INTO LATIN VARIATION WHICH IS BEGUN IN THE LOWER GRADES COMES INCREASINGLY INTO PROMINENCE HERE THE TEACHER GIVES A THOUGHT IN GERMAN A PUPIL IS ASKED TO RECAST IT IN BETTER GERMAN FORM THE NEXT PUPIL CONSTRUES IT IN GERMAN AND ANOTHER PUTS IT INTO LATIN THE READING OF THE DAY FURNISHES THE MATERIAL IN THE LOWER GRADES THE VARIATION IS MAINLY IN TENSE 670GREEKA AND LATIN IN THE HIGHER SCHOOLS OF GERMANY 671 NUMBER PERSON USE OF INTERROGATIVES ETC IN THE UPPER GRADES PARAPHRASING COMES INTO PLAY UNTIL ALL DANGER OF MISAPPREHEN SION OF THE THOUGHT HAS PASSED THE GERMAN FORMS ARE ALWAYS GIVEN AND CAREFULLY CONSTRUED IN THIS RESPECT PERHAPS AS MUCH AS IN ANY OTHER IS SEEN THE TENDENCY OF THE MODERN METHODS FORMERLY THE CUSTOM WAS TO HAVE MEMORIZED LARGE AMOUNTS OF THE TEXT PUTTING THE MAIN STRESS ON VOCABULARY TRANSLATION WAS AVOIDED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TODAY TRANSLATION IS TO THE FRONT THE EMPHA SIS IS PLACED ON THE THOUGHTCONTENT IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE THOUGHT THE PUPIL MUST ASSOCIATE IT WITH WHAT HE ALREADY KNOWS I E WITH THE MOTHER TONGUE THE DIVISION BETWEEN THE GYMNASIUM AND THE REALGYMNASIUM COMES WITH UNTERTERTIA THE PROGRAMME ABOVE GIVEN SHOWS THE LINES OF CLEAVAGE THE FORMAL GRAMMAR OF THE MIDDLE GRADES IS PRACTICALLY COMPLETED WITH UNTERTERTIA BUT UNTIL THE END OF THE SIXTH SCHOOL YEAR FULL ONEHALF OF THE TIME IS GIVEN TO EXERCISES INVOLVING AN APPLICATION OF GRAMMATICAL PRINCIPLES THE AIM HOWEVER AS I HAVE TRIED TO MAKE CLEAR IS THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE LITERATURE GRAMMAR IS AN IMPORTANT MEANS TO THAT END HENCE IT RARELY HAPPENS THAT AN HOUR IS GIVEN UP TO DRILL ON GRAMMAR THE PERIODS SCHEDULED FOR GRAMMAR IN THE MIDDLE GRADES ARE EMPLOYED IN CONSTRUING PARTS OF THE TEXT ALREADY READ AND IN PREPARING FOR FUTURE TRANSLATION INCIDENTALLY MUCH GRAM MATICAL DRILL IS GIVEN BUT THE IMMEDIATE END IS A BETTER UNDER STANDING OF THE TEXT IN ORDER TO FACILITATE TRANSLATION SINCE THE LATIN ESSAY AND VERSE MAKING ARE DONE AWAY WITH THE ONLY TEST OF THE STUDENTS APPRECIATION OF THE CLASSIC LANGUAGE IS IN THE SKILL HE DISPLAYS IN RETROVERSION AND THE EXCELLENCE OF HIS TRANS LATIONS THE LATIN COMPOSITION FORMALLY PRESCRIBED IN THE PRO GRAMME IS MERELY A SUMMARY OF THE  GRAMMAR WORK OF THE WEEK THE WORK OF THE LOWER AND MIDDLE GRADES IS BUT A PREPARA TION FOR THE REAL WORK OF THE COURSE WHICH IS TO BE FOUNDPAR EXCELLENCE IN THE UPPER CLASSES THIS IS DIVIDED INTO THREE MAIN LINESPOETICAL HISTORICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL THE READING OF POETRY WHICH IS BEGUN IN UNTERSECUNDA CULMINATES IN VERGILTHE SCHOOL REVIEW OVID AND HORACE AND IN HOMER BEGINNING WITH THE ODYSSEY AESCHYLUS AND SOPHOCLES HERE IN ADDITION TO A THOROUGH UNDER STANDING OF THE TEXT AN APPRECIATION OF ITS AESTHETIC QUALITIES IS INSISTED UPON A TASTE FOR THE BEAUTIFUL IN LITERATURE GROWS BY WHAT IT FEEDS ON MERE ADMIRATION OF THE BEAUTIFUL IS NOT SUFFI CIENT FULL POSSESSION DEMANDS THAT THE STUDENT MEMORIZE CHOICE SELECTIONS MAKE THEM HIS OWN A GERMAN PRIMANER HAS AT HIS TONGUES END MOST OF THE ODES OF HORACE AND MUCH OF ESCHYLUS AND SOPHOCLES ASIDE FROM THE PLEASURE WHICH SUCH POSSESSION GIVES IT HAS A PEDAGOGIC VALUE IN THE INTERPRETATION OF NEW MATERIAL A STUDENT KNOWING HALF OF HORACE BY HEART HAS NOT MERELY A WEALTH OF APPERCEPTIVE MATERIAL FOR THE OTHER HALF BUT A COMMAND OF PHRASEOLOGY METER AND HAPPY TURNS OF THOUGHT WHICH MUST NEEDS MAKE NEW TRANSLATION A PLEASURE WITH THE GREEK DRAMATISTS THE ACME OF POETIC STYLE IS REACHED AND IN THEM THE GREAT PROBLEMS OF HUMAN LIFE CONFRONT THE STU DENT NOWHERE IN THE COURSE IS THE POETS ART AT BETTER ADVAN TAGE NOWHERE IS THE ETHICAL CONTENT SO PROMINENT THE TRUE TEACHERHE WHO BELIEVES IN TEACHING MEN NOT BOOKSFINDS IN THE PAGES OF SOPHOCLES OPPORTUNITIES UNPARALLELED IN THE ANCIENT LITERATURE WITH A CLASS THOROUGHLY AT HOME IN THE TECHNIQUE OF THE DRAMA KNOWING PAGES OF IT BY HEART WHAT CAN NOT A TEACHER ACCOMPLISH I HAVE HEARD SUCH MASTERS AS DIREC TORS MUFF OF CASSEL REINHARDT OF FRANKFORT AND RICHTER OF JENANOT TO MENTION OTHERS TEACH SOPHOCLES IN A WAY TO MAKE ONE UNCERTAIN WHICH TO ADMIRE MOST THE MARVELOUS BEAUTY DEPTH OF EMOTION AND ETHICAL CONTENT OF THE TRAGEDY OR THE ARTIS TIC POWER OF THE TEACHER IN MAKING EVERY SCENE PULSATE WITH LIFE AND EVERY SENTENCE SPEAK STRAIGHT TO THE HEARTS OF THEIR STUDENTS THE ETHICAL THE AESTHETIC AND THE PATRIOTIC BLEND IN ONE THE LATIN HISTORIANS HAVE SOMETHING DEFINITE TO TELL THE GER MAN STUDENT OF HIS COUNTRYS HISTORIC PAST TACITUS AND CAESAR ARE BUT A STEP FARTHER REMOVED FROM HIS PRESENT THAN CHARLE MAGNE LIVY SALLUST AND THUCYDIDES ARE CONNECTING LINKS WITH ANTIQUITY THEY GIVE THE SETTING TOO FOR MUCH OF THE LITERATURE READ IN THE UPPER CLASSES HENCE IF THERE WERE NO 672GREEK AND LATIN IN THE HIGHER SCHOOLS OF GERMANY 673 DIRECT ARGUMENTS FOR PLACING HISTORICAL PROSE IN THE CURRICULUM IT WOULD STILL FIND A PLACE BECAUSE OF ITS INDIRECT VALUE THE PHILOSOPHICAL READINGS ARE MAINLY FROM CICERO AND PLATO FORMERLY AN INTRODUCTORY COURSE IN PHILOSOPHY WAS GIVEN IN ALL GYMNASIEN THE PRACTICE HAS LONG SINCE BEEN ABANDONED EXCEPT AS IT IS INCIDENTALLY THE OUTGROWTH OF CLASS WORK WITH CICERO AND PLATO IN MANY SCHOOLS TODAY SO GOOD A BEGINNING IS MADE THAT PHILOSOPHY MAY BE SAID STILL TO HAVE A PLACE AND JUST TO THE EXTENT THAT ATTENTION IS DIRECTED TO THE THOUGHT RATHER THAN TO THE LINGUISTIC FORMS IS PLATO MADE WORTH READING THE NEW PROGRAMME WILL I THINK GIVE CONSIDERABLE IMPETUS TO PHILOSOPHIC STUDY AT LEAST IT WILL SERVE TO AROUSE AN INTEREST IN PHILOSOPHY AT THE UNIVERSITY IT MAY BE PRESUMPTUOUS TO SAY IT BUT THE TENDENCY IN GER MANY TODAY IS AWAY FROM THOSE METHODS WHICH HAVE COME TO BE LOOKED UPON AS PECULIARLY GERMAN AND TOWARDS WHAT HAS LONG BEEN THE IDEAL OF THE BEST AMERICAN SCHOOLS THE MOVEMENT FOR THE EINHEITSCHULE IS ESSENTIALLY AN ATTEMPT TO PRESERVE THE CLASSICAL TRAINING AND AT THE SAME TIME PROVIDE A MEANS OF EASY TRANSITION FROM LOWER SCHOOLS TO THE CLASSICAL SCHOOL SO LATE AS THE TWELFTH YEAR OF AGE STATING IT IN ANOTHER WAY IT MEANS A SIXYEAR LATIN COURSE INSTEAD OF A NINEYEAR COURSE AGAIN THE REDUCTION OF TIME GIVEN TO CLASSICS HAS ELIMINATED MUCH OF THE FORMAL DRILL IN LINGUISTICS WHICH FORMERLY CHARACTERIZED THE INSTRUC TION THE INCREASED PRESSURE PUT UPON THE TEACHERS TO SECURE AS GOOD RESULTS AS BEFORE IS HAVING THE EFFECT OF MAKING METHOD MORE PROMINENT BUT THE MOST AMERICAN CHARACTERISTIC OF ALL IS THE IMPETUS GIVEN TO ANNOTATED AND ILLUSTRATED TEXTBOOKS THE OLD IDEA WAS THAT THE BAREST OUTLINE SHOULD BE PLACED IN THE PUPILS HANDSIN LANGUAGE WORK MERELY THE TEXT THE TEACHER WAS THE SOURCE OF ALL INSPIRATION AND INFORMATION WITHIN THREE YEARS THERE IS A MARKED TENDENCY TO GIVE THE CLASS TEXT BOOKS WITH INTRODUCTIONS OUTLINES EXPLANATIONS AND NOTES AS I WRITE I HAVE BEFORE ME COPIES OF THE CEDIPUS REX AND THE ANTIGONE PREPARED BY DIRECTOR MUFF OF CASSEL THESE BOOKS ARE EACH IN TWO SMALL VOLUMES ONE CONTAINS AN INTRODUCTION674 THE SCHOOL REV IEW TREATING OF THE GREEK TRAGEDY BEFORE SOPHOCLES THE LIFE AND WORK OF SOPHOCLES AN ANALYSIS AND CRITICISM OF THE THEME OF THE DRAMA EXPLANATIONS OF THE THEATER OF THE CHORUS AND THE ACTION OF THE PLAY THEN FOLLOWS THE TEXT WITH A SHORT INTRODUCTION TO EACH SCENE THE COMPANION VOLUME IS A COMMENTARY ON THE TEXT THIS SERIES OF TEXTS WHICH IS EDITED BY DIRECTORS H J MULLER BERLIN AND OSCAR JAGER COLOGNE AND PUBLISHED BY VELHAGEN AND KLASING LEIPSIC IS ONE OF THE LATEST AND MOST POPULAR UNDERTAKINGS IN THE LINE OF SCHOOLBOOKS IT AIMS TO SUPPLY TEXTS FOR THE ENTIRE COURSE THE NAMES OF THE EDITORS ATE EVIDENCE THAT THE WORK WILL BE SCHOLARLY THE PLAN IS AMERICAN BUT BIDS FAIR TO BECOME GERMAN AS WELL BUT EVEN THOUGH THE TENDENCY IN GERMANY IS TO SEEK THE IDEAL IN OUR DIRECTION WE HAVE STILL A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE ARRIVING AT THE MEETING POINT JAMES E RUSSELL UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO BOULDER COLORADO

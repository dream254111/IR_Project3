exposition of their present ideas of what constitutes the Grand Gulf formation by Messrs Smith and Aldrich SaIENaE July 3 pp 2026 I may say 1 That I withdraw the opinion that it is not new now that I understaend it clearly I re gard it as an absolutely new view 2 that so far as observed facts are concerned I am far lerom wishing to be understood as question ing the existence of a deposit of unfossiliferous clay which contains irrecognizable traces of vegetable matter which has a wide distri bution as claimed by these gentlemen and lies above the Chesapeake Miocene and below the socalled Lafayette from which it is not separated where I have observed it by any unconformity or characteristic peculiarity I would recall the fact that I have personally no knowledge of the Grand Gulf except what I have derived from such excellent au thorities as Wailes Iiilgard Smith IFangdon Professor G D Harris Miss Maury etc from their published writings and observations in the Seld My office has been after making Seld studies of the fossiliferous Tertiary es pecially the Chattahoochee and Chipola sec tions to endeavor to correlate with horizons of known age in the marine series the fresh or brackishwater formations almost destitute of ossils laid down about the margin of the Mississippi embayment during a long period of Tertiary time which have been xlamed bg the geologists above mentioned and to which so far no satisfactory kesr has been found84 SCIENCE N S VOL XVIII NO 446 The difference of opinion therefore be tween Messrs Smith and Aldrich and myself is in regard to ncbrnes and their application merely and not a calling in question of the accuracy of any observation made by thems It is an acknowledged fact I believe that at least since the period of the Vicksburg sedimentation a considerable part of the shores of the Mississippi embayment have been and still to some extent are the seat of a sedimentation of alluvial material in fresh or brackish water containing fragments of vege table Inatter converted into lignite and from which only a few rare specimens of fresh water molluscan fossils turtle shells etc have been obtained in half a century The rarity of freshwater shells is proof that the marshes or lagoons could not have been purely freshwater areas the absence of oysters etc shows that they were not permanently brackish and we are forced to offer the hypothesis that fresh and salt water so alternated over the area concerned that inhabitants of neither were able to nlaintain a footing and that the organic remains found are either drifted from elsewhere or the product of extremely local and temporary conditions The earlier deposits of this kind other things being equal we should expect to and I believe we do find at the greatest distance from the sea and in the most consolidated state though a comparatively recent trans gression has carried unconsolidated sediments over a large part if not all of the antecedent deposits Now it seems to me that in their interesting communication Messrs Smith and Aldrich have momentarily forgotten the l1is tory of research on this perplexing question Let us very briefly review it The Grand Gulf sandstone a rock  superior in hardness to granite itself  was first named by Wailes in 1854 who specifies as a typical exposure that on the bank of the Mississippi at Grand Gulf Claiborne Co Miss from which the formation was named Hence in the allocation of names to portions of the sedi ments which have since been hastily incluled under it we must reserve for this particular horizon the name of Grand Gulf Wailes helieved that more tractable rocks to the east ward were identical with this sandstone but everywhere it is described by him as a rock a hard or massive sandstone suitable in its softer phases for building stone millstones etc Beyond the AXississippi this sandstone reappears in Louisiana and according to Miss Maury extends across the state and as far as the Brazos River in Texas To the eastward near Oak Grove iFlorida the typical sand stones according to Professor Harris and Miss Maury  pass beneath the Oligocene Oak Grove sands indicating that the sandstone is approximately of the same age as the Chatta hoochee Ill Alabama the typical sandstone is rare and the series corresponding usually consists of clayey sands or joint clays  ac cording to the same authority In 1860 Hilgard in his valuable report on the  Agriculture and Geology of Mississippi considerably enlarged the scope of the forma tion taking in clays sands consolidated and unconsolidated over a large area of country Later as mentioned in my last communica tOIl he came to the conclusion that the series included a succession of sediments of ages between the Vicksburg and the drift The fact that at the typical locality the flinty sandstone is succeeded by the unconsolidated LaCayette or Orange Sand is of course no evidence of continuous sedimentation with out a break between the two such as appears to be the case in the aluminous clay of the Chattahoochee where no distinct line of de marcation is visible between the latter and the socalled Lafayette conformably above it As one of the problems to be solved this state of things has long attracted the atten tion of the few geologists working on the southern Tertiary Some fifteen years ago I received from Professor Smith what were hailed as fossils at last from the Grand Gulf sallds of Roberts Ala a horizon which in 1894 Professor Smith included in the Grand Gulf formationf They were very imperfect but fortunately contained one identifiable characteristic Oligocene species of the Chipola horizon Subsequently Mr 1j C Johnson obtained from what he pronounced to be Bull An Pal No 15 p 70 1902 t  Coastal Plain of Alabama p 102SCIENCE JULY 17 1903 85 Grand Gulf strata near Vernal Miss another series of fossils which I was able to determine as of late Chesapeake or early Pliocene age and which were then elitninated from the so called Grand Gulf and placed by Professor Smith at the top of the Miocene with the name of the Pascagoula formation op ctt p 94 In 1894 Professor Smith expressed himself in regard to the  Grand Gulf  in the follow ing language The barren Grand Gulf sands pass towards the east into the marine deposits of the Chattahoochee Oligocene  which are their time equivalent  op ctt p 17 and  The underlying division o the Grand Gulf X X its position is identical with that of the Chattahoochee limestone of Mr Ijangdon and there is no room for any reasonable doubt about their identity in age op ctt p 106 Since that time Professor Harris and his party of students have traced typical  Grand Gulf  sandstones beneath the Oak Grove Oli gocene sands near Oak Grove Santa Rosa County Elorida as already mentioned I have no prejudice as to the application of the name Grand Gulf to any particular series to which it can be shown to belong but I am not convinced that Professor Smith and Mr Aldrich in restricting the name in the manner and to the stratum now proposed have shown proof of its identity with the original formation described by Wailes I feel certain that the Pleistocene age of Wailes formation is unproved I believe it to be unlikely and in view of the record as above summarized I feel justified in referring it as heretofore to the upper Oligocene pend ing more exact and ample information WM H DALL SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION JU1Y 6 1903 ANSWER TO PROFESSOR COCKERELL REGARDING EIIGHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS OF NEW MEXICO TO THE EDITOR OF SCIENCE Professor T D A Cockerell has made some statements in his article on the condition of afEairs at the New Mexico Normal University which appeared in your columns May 8 which seem to me can hardly be passed without notice I do not care to discuss the matter which Proessor Cockerell presents concerning the conditions at the College of Agriculture anl Mechanic Arts or at the Normal School at Las Vegas It is always unfortunate whe there is a lack of harmonious relations be tween a board o regents and the president or faculty of any institution and still more unfortunate when such relations are the re sult of political influences There is no doubt but at times great injustice results to indi viduals and great harm to the institution and the broader cause of education lHew insti tutions of any considerable age have not had some differences arise between their managing boards and their faculties at some time in their history and no institution can boast that its organization is such that it is entirely saeguarded against any such unfortunate condition in the future It must be recog nized however that such breaches in the harmonious administration of the afEairs of an institution are usually very shortlived The organization of our public institutions may be such that they are more susceptible to such outbreaks than others but it is to be doubted In the public institution it is usu ally politicsCwhich interferes in private in stitutions it is personal prejudice in denom inational schools it is denominational creed or religious difference The character of the factor may vary but the result is nearly the same In all such cases it can usually be shown that some one has akused the powers and privileges of a position of authority In public institutions all parties fronl the gov ernor who usually holds the appointing power to membership on the board of regents down to the student in the classroom are servants of the people and all are working under a regularly established system of laws These laws determine the authoritative ranking of each Each party has a duty to the subordi nate elements of the organization and an obligation of obedience to the superior in rank In most institutions these duties and obligations are usually well defined by law

MAGNETISMNNO III BY LIEUTCOLONEL EDWARD SABINE RA FRS RECEIVED DECEMBER 16 1841READ JANUARY 20 1842 IN THE PRESENT NUMBER OF THESE CONTRIBUTIONS I PROPOSE TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF THE OBSERVATIONS ON THE MAGNETIC INTENSITY MADE AT SEA BY THE OFFICERS OF HER MAJESTYS SHIPS EREBUS AND TERROR ON THEIR PASSAGE FROM ENGLAND TO KERGUELEN ISLAND THE UNREDUCED OBSERVATIONS TRANSMITTED TO THE ADMIRALTY BY THE COMMANDERS CAPTAINS ROSS AND CROZIER HAVING BEEN PLACED IN MY HANDS FOR THAT PURPOSE THEY WILL BE DIVIDED FOR CONVENIENCE INTO TWO SECTIONS VIZ  5 OBSERVATIONS BETWEEN ENGLAND AND THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE  6 OBSERVATIONS BETWEEN THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE AND KERGUELEN ISLAND  5 OBSERVATIONS BETWEEN ENGLAND AND THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE THE OBSERVATIONS IN THE EREBUS WERE MADE BY THE STATICAL METHOD DEVISED BY MR FOX WITH ONE OF HIS INSTRUMENTS OF 71 INCHES DIAMETER THE INTENSITIES WERE MEASURED BY THE ANGLES OF DEFLECTION PRODUCED IN DIFFERENT LOCALITIES BY A CONSTANT WEIGHT APPLIED TO A GROOVED WHEEL ON THE AXLE OF THE NEEDLE AND THE RATIO OF THE INTEN SITIES IS INVERSELY AS THE SINES OF THE ANGLES OF DEFLECTION SUBJECT TO A CORRECTION FOR DIFFERENCES OF TEMPERATURE OF THE NEEDLE COMPUTED BY THE FORMULA 00016 I T T IN WHICH T IS THE STANDARD AND T THE OBSERVED TEMPERATURE IN DEGREES OF FAHRENHEIT 00016 A COEFFICIENT DETERMINED EXPERIMENTALLY BY MR FOX AND  THE OBSERVED INTEN SITY AT SEA WHERE THE MANIPULATION OF THE WEIGHTS CAUSES AN EXPOSURE OF THE NEEDLE WHICH IN BAD WEATHER PARTICULARLY IS LIABLE TO OCCASION INJURY THE PLAN RECOM MENDED BY MR FOX OF USING DEFLECTING MAGNETS INSTEAD OF WEIGHTS WAS FREQUENTLY RESORTED TO IN THIS CASE THE RATIO OF THE INTENSITY IN DIFFERENT LOCALITIES IS INVERSELY AS THE SINES OF THE ANGLES OF DEFLECTION AND DIRECTLY AS THE WEIGHTS EQUIVALENT TO THE DEFLECTING FORCE OF THE DEFLECTOR ON THE NEEDLE AT THE RESPECTIVE ANGLES OR T W SINV W SIN V WHERE I V AND W ARE THE INTENSITY ANGLE OF DEFLECTION AND EQUIVALENT WEIGHT AT A BASE STATION AND I V AND W CORRESPONDING VALUES AT ANOTHER STATION A TABLE IS USUALLY FORMED FOR EACH INSTRUMENT EXPERIMENTALLY UNDER MR FOXS OWN DIRECTION OF THE EQUIVALENT OR AS THEY ARE TERMED BY HIM THE COERCING WEIGHTS FOR EACH DE FLECTOR ON EACH OF THE NEEDLES AT THE DIFFERENT ANGLES WHICH ARE LIKELY TO OCCUR IN THE COURSE OF THE OBSERVATIONS THIS IS DONE BY PLACING THE DEFLECTOR SUCCESSIVELY AT MDCCCXLII CLIEUTCOLONEL SABINE ON TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM ANGLES FROM THE DIP EACH DIFFERING ONE DEGREE FROM THE PRECEDING THE NEEDLE IS THEREBY DEFLECTED TO A SMALLER ANGLE ON THE SIDE OF THE DIP OPPOSITE TO THE DEFLECTOR AND IS BROUGHT BACK TO THE DIP BY A WEIGHT APPLIED TO THE GROOVED WHEEL ON THE AXLE THIS WEIGHT IS CALLED THE COERCING WEIGHT CORRESPONDING TO THE ANGLE FROM THE DIP AT WHICH THE DEFLECTOR WAS PLACED FOR GREATER ACCURACY THE TABLE IS FORMED FROM RE SULTS OBTAINED BY PLACING THE DEFLECTOR SUCCESSIVELY ON EITHER SIDE OF THE NEEDLE OWING TO ACCIDENTAL CIRCUMSTANCES NO TABLE OF THIS DESCRIPTION WAS PREPARED FOR THIS INSTRUMENT BEFORE THE EXPEDITION SAILED THE PRESSURE OF OTHER DUTIES PREVENTED ITS BEING DONE AT ST HELENA THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE OR AT KERGUELEN ISLAND AND AT VAN DIEMEN ISLAND THE END OF THE AXLE OF THE NEEDLE BEING ACCIDENTALLY BROKEN THE NEEDLE WAS RETURNED TO ENGLAND TO BE REPAIRED AND WAS THUS SEPARATED FROM THE INSTRUMENT AND FROM THE DEFLECTORS UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WE HAVE NO OTHER RESOURCE FOR REDUCING THE OBSERVATIONS MADE WITH THE DEFLECTORS THAN TO FORM A TABLE FROM THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE WEIGHTS AND DEFLECTORS WHEN BOTH METHODS HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED AT THE SAME STATION WHICH SHALL ANSWER THE SAME PURPOSE AS A TABLE OF COERCING WEIGHTS FORTUNATELY THE NUMBER OF SUCH STATIONS IS CONSIDERABLE WE MAY FORM THIS TABLE IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER FOR THE PRIMARY OR BASE STATION LET V BE THE ANGLE OF DEFLECTION WITH A CONSTANT WEIGHT W AND V THE ANGLE OF DEFLEC TION PRODUCED BY THE DEFLECTOR PLACED AT THE DIP THEN IS W  W SIN V COSEC V W BEING THE WEIGHT EQUIVALENT TO THE DEFLECTING FORCE OF THE DEFLECTOR AT THE ANGLE V IF SEVERAL CONSTANT WEIGHTS WERE USED AT THE PRIMARY STATION THE VALUE OF W MAY BE OBTAINED FROM EACH SEPARATELY AND AN ARITHMETICAL MEAN TAKEN THEN AT ANOTHER STATION AT WHICH THE ANGLES OF DEFLECTION HAVE BEEN OBSERVED BOTH WITH THE DEFLECTOR AND WITH CONSTANT WEIGHTS THE EQUIVALENT WEIGHT WL TO THE ANGLE V PRODUCED BY THE DEFLECTOR MAY BE OBTAINED FROM I W SIN V I WSINV I BEING THE INTENSITY AT THE PRIMARY STATION AND I THE INTENSITY DERIVED BY THE METHOD OF CONSTANT WEIGHTS AT THE OTHER STATION THE

THE LATTER AS ABSCISSAE A LINE DRAWN BY THE EYE THROUGH THE TERMINATIONS OF THE ORDINATES WILL GIVE THE VALUES OF W FOR EACH DEGREE OF V PRODUCED BY THE DEFLECTOR IN THE INTENSITY INSTRUMENT OF THE EREBUS TWO DEFLECTORS WERE USED SOMETIMES SE PARATELY AND SOMETIMES COMBINED THEY WERE DESIGNATED N AND 8 ACCORDING TO THE POLE OF THE NEEDLE TO WHICH THEY WERE RESPECTIVELY APPLIED THEY WERE CONTAINED IN BRASS TUBES N WITH ITS NORTH POLE AND S WITH ITS SOUTH POLE TOWARDS THE END OF THE TUBE WHICH SCREWED INTO THE LIMB OF THE INSTRUMENT CONSEQUENTLY DEFLECTOR N IN THIS ANALYSIS MAY BE MADE

BY ITS CONTINUITY THAT THE FORCE OF THE DEFLECTOR REMAINED UNCHANGED DURING THE WHOLE OF THE SERIES IT EXHIBITS NO DISCORDANCES WITH ANY OF THE VALUES OF W BUT SUCH AS MAY WELL BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE UNAVOIDABLE DISCREPANCIES OF SINGLE OBSERVATIONS BY MEANS OF THIS GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION THE SUBJOINED TABLE HAS BEEN FORMED OF THE VALUES OF W FOR EACH DEGREE OF V PERMITTING THE INTEN SITIES I TO

SUBSEQUENTLY AND RECEIVED BY CAPTAIN CROZIER AT VAN DIEMEN ISLAND IN AUGUST 1840 AN IN STRUMENT OF ONLY TWO INCHES RADIUS FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING BOTH THE DIP AND INTENSITY AT SEA MIGHT PREVIOUSLY HAVE BEEN REGARDED BY MANY PERSONS AS SCARCELY MORE THAN A PHILOSOPHICAL TOY AND AS LITTLE LIKELY TO YIELD RESULTS HAVING THE PRECI SION WHICH IS NOW REQUIRED IN SUCH DETERMINATIONS IT HAS HOWEVER IN CAPTAIN CROZIERS HANDS FULLY JUSTIFIED THE EXPECTATIONS WHICH MR FOX FROM HIS OWN EXPE RIMENTS WITH IT HAD VENTURED TO ENTERTAIN ON LAND THE INSTRUMENTS OF THE EREBUS AND TERROR ARE FOR THE MOST PART AS FAR AS THEY HAVE YET REACHED US NEARLY IDENTICAL IN THEIR RESULTS CONFINING OUR ATTENTION TO THE INTENSITY AS THE SUBJECT IMMEDIATELY BEFORE US THE INTENSITIES AT JAMES TOWN IN ST HELENA

DECREASING LATITUDE THEIR CONSISTENCY IS NOT SO EASILY FOL LOWED BY THE EYE ON ATTENTIVE EXAMINATION OF THE MAP IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO TRACE WITHIN SMALL LIMITS THE COURSE OF AN IDEAL LINE WHICH SHOULD CONNECT THE POINTS IN THE SEVERAL MERIDIANS WHERE THE INTENSITY WAS WEAKEST AT THE EPOCH OF CAPTAIN ROSSS VOYAGE THE DETERMINATION OF THE POSITION OF THIS LINE IS EASIER AND IN SOME RESPECTS MORE SURE THAN THAT OF AN ISODYNARNIC LINE BECAUSE IT IS INDEPENDENT OF THE PERMANENCY OF THE MAGNETISM OF THE NEEDLE EMPLOYED FOR MORE THAN THE FEW DAYS OCCUPIED IN THE IMNMEDIATE RESEARCH  AND IT IS ALSO INDEPENDENT OF THE CORRECTNESS OF AN ASSUMED INTENSITY AT A BASE STATION IT IS THEREFORE TO BE EXPECTED THAT THE POSITION OF THIS LINE WILL BECOME IN FUTURE YEARS THE SUBJECT OF FREQUENT EXAMINATION SERVING TO MARK FROM TIME TO TIME THE PROGRESS OF THE SECULAR CHANGE IN ITS POSITION THIS MAY BE DONE WITH THE MORE INTEREST AND ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THERE IS REASON TO BELIEVE THAT ITSPOSITION IS CHANGING RAPIDLY IN THE SPACE REFERRED TO PARTICULARLY IN THE EASTERN MERIDIANS AND THAT THE SOUTHERN MAGNETIC HEMISPHERE IN SO FAR AS ITS BOUNDARY MAY BE INDICATED BY THIS LINE IS IN THAT QUARTER OF THE GLOBE GAINING RAPIDLY UPON THE NORTHERN IN THE FIRST OF THE PRESENT SERIES OF CONTRIBUTIONS THE LINE OF LEAST INTENSITY WAS DRAWN FROM OBSERVATIONS CORRESPONDING NEARLY TO THE EPOCH OF 1825 AND THIS LINE OF 1825 IS LIGHTLY RETRACED IN THE PRESENT MAP FOR THE PURPOSE OF COM PARISON IT WILL BE SEEN THAT WHILST ITS GENERAL DIRECTION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE OB SERVATIONS OF CAPTAIN ROSS IN 1840 ITS EARLIER POSITION IS EVERYWHERE THREE OR FOUR DEGREES SOUTH OF THAT WHICH WOULD BE NOW INFERRED IT IS READILY ADMITTED THAT MANY OF THE OBSERVATIONS FROM WHICH THE LINE OF 1825 WAS DRAWN ARE INFERIOR IN PRECISION TO THOSE OF CAPTAIN ROSS AND I REJOICE IN THE LATE IMPROVEMENT IN THIS CLASS OF OB SERVATIONS FOR WHICH WE ARE MAINLY INDEBTED TO THE METHOD AND INSTRUMENT DEVISED BY MR FOX AND TO THE ZEAL AND UNWEARIED PATIENCE OF OUR NAVAL OFFICERS TO AN OBSERVER HOWEVER WHO IS PROCEEDING IN A NEARLY NORTH AND SOUTH DIRECTION VERY LITTLE UNCERTAINTY ATTENDS THE DETERMINATION OF THE TIME AND PLACE AT WHICH HE FINDS THE WEAKEST INTENSITY AND IF WE COMPARE THE OBSERVATIONS OF DUNLOP ERMAN AND SULIVAN WITH THOSE OF ROSS AND CROZIER WE INVARIABLY FIND THAT THE EARLIER OB SERVER MAKES THE PLACE OF THE MINIMUM A LITTLE MORE SOUTHERLY THAN LATER DETERMI NATIONS A GLANCE AT THE MAP SUFFICES TO SHOW WHERE DETERMINATIONS ARE NOW MOST WANTED AND TO POINT OUT THE TRACK WHERE

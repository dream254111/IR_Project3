MagnetismnNo III By LieutColonel EDWARD SABINE RA FRS Received December 16 1841Read January 20 1842 IN the present number of these Contributions I propose to give an account of the observations on the magnetic intensity made at sea by the officers of Her Majestys ships Erebus and Terror on their passage from England to Kerguelen Island the unreduced observations transmitted to the Admiralty by the Commanders Captains Ross and CROZIER having been placed in my hands for that purpose They will be divided for convenience into two sections viz  5 Observations between England and the Cape of Good Hope  6 Observations between the Cape of Good Hope and Kerguelen Island  5 Observations between England and the Cape of Good Hope The observations in the Erebus were made by the statical method devised by Mr Fox with one of his instruments of 71 inches diameter The intensities were measured by the angles of deflection produced in different localities by a constant weight applied to a grooved wheel on the axle of the needle and the ratio of the inten sities is inversely as the sines of the angles of deflection subject to a correction for differences of temperature of the needle computed by the formula 00016 I t t in which t is the standard and t the observed temperature in degrees of FAHRENHEIT 00016 a coefficient determined experimentally by Mr Fox and  the observed inten sity At sea where the manipulation of the weights causes an exposure of the needle which in bad weather particularly is liable to occasion injury the plan recom mended by Mr Fox of using deflecting magnets instead of weights was frequently resorted to In this case the ratio of the intensity in different localities is inversely as the sines of the angles of deflection and directly as the weights equivalent to the deflecting force of the deflector on the needle at the respective angles or T w sinv w sin v where I v and w are the intensity angle of deflection and equivalent weight at a base station and I v and w corresponding values at another station A table is usually formed for each instrument experimentally under Mr Foxs own direction of the equivalent or as they are termed by him the coercing weights for each de flector on each of the needles at the different angles which are likely to occur in the course of the observations This is done by placing the deflector successively at MDCCCXLII CLIEUTCOLONEL SABINE ON TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM angles from the dip each differing one degree from the preceding the needle is thereby deflected to a smaller angle on the side of the dip opposite to the deflector and is brought back to the dip by a weight applied to the grooved wheel on the axle this weight is called the coercing weight corresponding to the angle from the dip at which the deflector was placed For greater accuracy the table is formed from re sults obtained by placing the deflector successively on either side of the needle Owing to accidental circumstances no table of this description was prepared for this instrument before the Expedition sailed the pressure of other duties prevented its being done at St Helena the Cape of Good Hope or at Kerguelen Island and at Van Diemen Island the end of the axle of the needle being accidentally broken the needle was returned to England to be repaired and was thus separated from the instrument and from the deflectors Under these circumstances we have no other resource for reducing the observations made with the deflectors than to form a table from the observations of the weights and deflectors when both methods have been employed at the same station which shall answer the same purpose as a table of coercing weights Fortunately the number of such stations is considerable We may form this table in the following manner For the primary or base station let V be the angle of deflection with a constant weight W and v the angle of deflec tion produced by the deflector placed at the dip then is w  W sin v cosec V w being the weight equivalent to the deflecting force of the deflector at the angle v If several constant weights were used at the primary station the value of w may be obtained from each separately and an arithmetical mean taken Then at another station at which the angles of deflection have been observed both with the deflector and with constant weights the equivalent weight wl to the angle v produced by the deflector may be obtained from I w sin v I wsinv I being the intensity at the primary station and I the intensity derived by the method of constant weights at the other station The values of w thus computed for all the stations where the weights and deflectors were both used being projected in a graphical representation with the corresponding values of v the former as ordi nates the latter as abscissae a line drawn by the eye through the terminations of the ordinates will give the values of w for each degree of v produced by the deflector In the intensity instrument of the Erebus two deflectors were used sometimes se parately and sometimes combined they were designated N and 8 according to the pole of the needle to which they were respectively applied They were contained in brass tubes N with its north pole and S with its south pole towards the end of the tube which screwed into the limb of the instrument consequently Deflector N in This analysis may be made when the needle is in other positions but Mr Fox now prefers the vertical one or when the needle stands at 900 the circle being perpendicular to the plane of the magnetic meridian 10LIEUTCOLONEL SABINE ON TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM the Table signifies that the deflector having its north pole towards the screw was placed opposite that division of the circle which the north end of the needle had pre viously indicated as the dip and the angle of deflection v is a mean of the deflec tions of the needle first on the one side and then on the other side of the deflector In the case of this deflector we have the angle v observed in London 22 57 and the value of w derived from the angles with the four constant weights of 1 2 3 and 4 grains  2114 grs Regarding London as the primary station and the intensity  1 the values of w at the several stations where both weights and deflectors were used are found by w  5422 I sin v The table of observations furnishes seventyfour occasions between England and the Cape of Good Hope in which this deflector was used in comparison with the con stant weights we have consequently so many values of w from which to form a table for each degree of deflection The angles v produced by this deflector increased fiom 22 57 in London to above 34 where the intensity was weakest and again de creased to 29 53 at the Cape consequently the ordinates corresponding to the smaller angles are derived partly from the earlier and partly from the later observa tions of the series The line drawn freely through the points forming the termina tions of the ordinates shows by its continuity that the force of the deflector remained unchanged during the whole of the series it exhibits no discordances with any of the values of w but such as may well be attributed to the unavoidable discrepancies of single observations By means of this graphical representation the subjoined Table has been formed of the values of w for each degree of v permitting the inten sities I to be computed relative to the force unity in London by the formula I  1845 w cosec v Values of w Deflector N In the case of deflector S the table of observations furnishes 109 occasions be tween London and the Cape of Good Hope in which the angle v was observed in comparison with the angles produced by the constanlt weights consequently we have 109 values of w to be combined in a graphical representation The line freely drawn through the terminations of the ordinates is continuous from August 1839 to the noonobservation of February 12 1840 when the continuity becomes interrupted and a second line corresponding to a diminished force in the deflector commences and continues unbroken to the Cape of Good Hope The loss of force in the de c 2 grs grs 23 2113 30 1929 24  2085 31  1904 25

values of w the one Table A corresponding to the force of the deflector between August 1839 and February 12th 1840 and the other Table B to the weaker force between February 12th and the Cape of Good

contains the observations made with the weights and deflectors on shore and on board the Erebus between London and the Cape of Good Hope Of 647 observations comprised in this Table I have only found it necessary to consider a single one as doubtful namely the second observation with the constant weight of one grain at the Cape of Good Hope its result differs so much from that of the ob servation on the preceding day with the same weight and with those of the prece ding and of the same day with the weight of 1 grain that I have thought it safer to omit it in taking the mean of the results at that station but the observation itself and its result are both given in the Table 1314 LIEUTCOLONEL SABINE ON TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM TABLE I Observations of the Magnetic Intensity on Shore and on

TerrorThe observations in the Terror were made with a Foxs needle of four inches diameter one of equal size with that in the Erebus which was not ready when the Expedition sailed having been sent out subsequently and received by Captain CROZIER at Van Diemen Island in August 1840 An in strument of only two inches radius for the purpose of determining both the dip and intensity at sea might previously have been regarded by many persons as scarcely more than a philosophical toy and as little likely to yield results having the preci sion which is now required in such determinations It has however in Captain CROZIERS hands fully justified the expectations which Mr Fox from his own expe riments with it had ventured to entertain On land the instruments of the Erebus and Terror are for the most part as far as they have yet reached us nearly identical in their results Confining our attention to the intensity as the subject immediately before us the intensities at James Town in St Helena and at Longwood in the same island measured by the instruments of the two ships the days and spots of observa tion being the same are by the Erebus in the proportion of 586 at Longwood to 611 at James Town and by the Terror as 587 to 611 The agreement is in this case the more valuable because we are justified by it in ascribing the difference thus found between places so geographically near to each other to a really existing differ ence viz to station error rather than to accident or to observation error as might have been done had only a single instrument been used A similar accord in the de terminations of the two instruments is shown by the results at the Cape of Good Hope and Kerguelen Island which though more properly belonging to the next section may be instanced here in evidence of the confirmation which the two instruments  Omitted in the mean 25 MDCCCXL1I ELIEUTCOLONEL SABINE ON TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM mutually afford each other  the Erebus making the intensity on shore at Christmas Harbour in Kerguelen Island to be as 1 068 to 0715 at Simons Bay and the Terror as 1 0675 to 0715 At sea where in consequence of the motion of the ship the inferior size of the fourinch instrument cannot be compensated by additional time given to the reading or by other arrangments conducing to minute accuracy the probable error of a single result appears as might be expected to be somewhat greater with the four inchthan with the 72inch needle but with this reservation the observations made at sea with the two instruments when the ships were in company are highly confirmatory each of the other The table which has been received from the Terror contains almost daily obser vations from the 1st of January 1840 until her arrival at the Cape of Good Hope in the following March The intensities were observed both by deflectors and by con stant weights which latter in the fourinch instrument were 5 and 3 of a grain St Helena is the only land station observed at in the passage the intensities ob served at sea have therefore been computed relatively to the observations at James Town St Helena taken as a base station  and the value of the intensity at Janmes Town has been taken as determined by the Erebus viz as 0611 to unity in London or as 0838 to 1372 in London The values of w for the Terrors deflectors N and S required instead of a table of coercing weights in computing the intensities when the deflectors were used have been derived by the method already explained Tables of these values for each degree of deflection are subjoined neither on a careful ex amination of the observations nor in the process of forming these tables does there appear any reason to suppose that the deflectors or the needle sustained any change in magnetic condition during the period embraced by the observations under notice Values of w Terrors Deflectors With the values of w taken fiom this Table the intensities at sea are obtained rela tively to 0611 at St Helena London

Cape of Good Hope the Expedition traversed three times that large space of the Atlantic in which the mag netic intensity is less than in any other part of the surface of the globe first in a southerly course in and about the meridian of 330 E a second time in beating up to St Helena in and about the meridian of 345 E and a third time in the course from St Helena to the Cape of Good Hope in and about the meridian of 350 E Before we examine more particularly the results of the observations made during these traverses it will be proper to clear them from the effects of the ships iron as far as the data furnished will enable us to do so It is obvious on a simple inspection of the results in the tables that in the southern hemisphere when the ships head was on the points from S E to SW the intensity observed was generally slightly in excess and on the contrary when on the points from NE to NW slightly in defect and that such was the case in both ships At St Helena and at the Cape of Good Hope an endeavour was made to ascertain more precisely the effect of the ships iron in modifying the results bv placing the ships head successively on the principal points of the compass and ob serving the intensity in each position At St Helena the experiment failed owing apparently to the disturbing influence of the island itself which even at the distance at which the vessels were anchored was found to be sufficient to mask the local at traction of the ship and to produce anomalies which were not experienced at sea At the Cape the geological character of the land interposed no such difficulty The following Table shows the differences found at Siinons Bay between the intensity observed on each of the sixteen principal points of the compass and the arithmetical mean of the whole Each difference has the sign prefixed which would be required for a correction to the arithmetical mean Allowing for discrepancies incidental to single observations the general aspect of the differences is sufficiently systematic to justify us in regarding them as principally occasioned by the influence of the ships iron Corrections Mean o the Corrections Mean of th Mean of the      Mean

experiments at the Cape and Kerguelen Island agree in indicating the points of greatest disturbance to be from SE through south to SW causing an augmen tationand from NE through north to NW causing a diminutionin the re gular magnetic intensity the augmentation on the southerly points being rather greater than the diminution on the northerly compensated by there being a greater number of the remaining points in defect than in excess the latter points being affected in a minor degree Considering that the differences shown in the two last Tables necessarily combine the errors of observation with the influence of local attrac tion we may regard the effect of the ships iron on the intensity needle as probably amounting in extreme cases to Tooth of the earths magnetic force but on much the greater number of points as probably far less than that amount In Table III which contains the results of the almost daily observations made in the Erebus be tween December 7 1839 and February 29 1840

Atlantic to which they refer and are examined in detail their systematic character beconmes much more obvious than in the Table where in consequence of the successive alter nations of increasing and decreasing latitude their consistency is not so easily fol lowed by the eye On attentive examination of the map it is not difficult to trace within small limits the course of an ideal line which should connect the points in the several meridians where the intensity was weakest at the epoch of Captain Rosss voyage The determination of the position of this line is easier and in some respects more sure than that of an isodynarnic line because it is independent of the permanency of the magnetism of the needle employed for more than the few days occupied in the imnmediate research  and it is also independent of the correctness of an assumed intensity at a base station It is therefore to be expected that the position of this line will become in future years the subject of frequent examination serving to mark from time to time the progress of the secular change in its position This may be done with the more interest and advantage because there is reason to believe that itsposition is changing rapidly in the space referred to particularly in the eastern meridians and that the southern magnetic hemisphere in so far as its boundary may be indicated by this line is in that quarter of the globe gaining rapidly upon the northern In the first of the present series of Contributions the line of least intensity was drawn from observations corresponding nearly to the epoch of 1825 and this line of 1825 is lightly retraced in the present map for the purpose of com parison It will be seen that whilst its general direction is consistent with the ob servations of Captain Ross in 1840 its earlier position is everywhere three or four degrees south of that which would be now inferred It is readily admitted that many of the observations from which the line of 1825 was drawn are inferior in precision to those of Captain Ross and I rejoice in the late improvement in this class of ob servations for which we are mainly indebted to the method and instrument devised by Mr Fox and to the zeal and unwearied patience of our naval officers To an observer however who is proceeding in a nearly north and south direction very little uncertainty attends the determination of the time and place at which he finds the weakest intensity and if we compare the observations of DUNLOP ERMAN and SULIVAN with those of Ross and CROZIER we invariably find that the earlier ob server makes the place of the minimum a little more southerly than later determi nations A glance at the map suffices to show where determinations are now most wanted and to point out the track where additional observations would be most valuable it would be nearly that of a vessel making the eastern passage to the Cape of Good Hope  Philosophical Transactions 1840 Plate V F 2 35wLIEUTCOLONEL SABINE ON TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM  6 Observations of Intensity between the Cape of Good Hope and Kerguelen Island On the 6th of April 1840 the Expedition quitted Simons Bay and on the same night the Erebus and Terror parted company and made their passage to Kerguelen Island on separate courses Although the weather was very unfavourable the prac tice of daily observation with the magnetical instruments was continued with very few exceptions by the Erebus during the whole passage and by the Terror from Simons Bay as far as the meridian of the Crozet Islands which was the first rendezvous The observations of intensity on board the Erebus were chiefly made with de flector S the other deflector N having been used only five times during the whole passage whilst the number of observations with S amounts to thirtysix For the values of w in the case of deflector S we have the comparisons with the constant weights at the Cape and Kerguelen Island and three good intermediate comparisons at sea viz on the 1lth 12th and 18th of April a fourth attempt on the 1st of May failed from some accidental error in the observation with the constant weight Pursuing the plan of graphical representation already described we find that the line connecting the terminations of the ordinates at the Cape and at Kerguelen Island passes either through or extremely near the terminations of the other three ordinates indicating the unchanged magnetism of the deflector and we obtain the following Table of the values of w for the degrees of deflection in the Table Values of w deflector S Erebus

the two intermediate comparisons at sea with the constant weights exhibit ing considerable discordances either from the unfavourable circumstances of weather or possibly in consequence of an actual small change of force in the deflector I have not attempted to deduce results from the observations either with deflector N or with N and S combined I have also omitted in the mean deductions the results of the observations with the constant weight of one grain on the 1st of May and 29th of June these observations being obviously affected with some accidental error For the Terrors deflectors

and Kerguelen Island are so nearly the same 733 at the Cape and 735 at Kerguelen Island that we may take the arithmetical mean 734 for all the intermediate stations without sensible inconvenience whence the for mula for the calculation of the intensity becomes I  388 cosec v As we have only the comparisons with the constant weights at the Cape and Kergue len Island from which to derive the values of w for the Terrors deflectors for all the intermediate degrees of v we might be disposed to fear that the data were scarcely sufficient for that purpose but when we examine the intensities deduced from the observations with the two deflectors both having been used at all the intermediate stationsexcept one we perlceive that their accordance is in general remarkably good which would scarcely be the case unless the elements of calculation were tolerably correct So close an agreement in the partial observations in a passage made in tempestuous weather is certainly very creditable both to the instrument and to the observers Those who interest themselves in examining the progress which magnetic maps of the portion of the globe occupied by sea are making towards accuracy will compare the intensities between the Cape of Good Hope and Kerguelen Island contained in the subjoined Tables with the isodynamic lines drawn from Mr DUNLOPS observa tions in the first Number of these Contributions The prolongation of those lines into the more southerly latitudes traversed by the Erebus and Terror would suit ex tremely well with the intensities which are here given  Philosophical

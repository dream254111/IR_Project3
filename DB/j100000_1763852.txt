line west to east through thecircular area corresponded very closely with the prolongation of a line running through the north border of the rectangular area In the southwest quadrant a slim pine seventy to seventyfive feet high was left standing surrounded by seven estumps or shafts varying in height from ten or fifteen to forty or more Seet and in distance from the standing tree from five to twenty five feet  Near the centre of the circular area two trees stood side by sidej east and west of each other and so near that their trunks at the bases could not have been more than a few inches apart if they did not actually touch The tree on the east side was thrown from west to east and the other in the opposite direction from east to west Two pines fifty to sixty feet high and thirty to forty feet tapart one in the southeast the other in the northeast quadrant and about equidistant from the east and west central line dividing these quadrants were thrown towards the central line the one from aorth to south the other from south to north tornado of Dec 22 I884 They apparently fell simultaneously and met in the fall sfor their broken trunks and branches  were mingled together in a confused heap the branches of one tree undistinguishable from those of the other The cabin of Isaac Johnson a negro laborer hsituated in the track near the western end of the rectangular area vas partially unroofed and otherwise damaged lIe stated that tis tablewareplates spoons knives and forks went flying out of the door like so many birds and after the storm he found his fanner securely poised on a stump bottom upwards about seventy yards from his cabin and on the fanner lay his nutmeggrater as though placed there by hand the fanner is a shallows traylike vessel made of straw The trunks of some trees pine and hickory seemed to have been rent asunder as by a splitting force acting within the trunks and in these cases the upper segmentwas scarce ly ever entirely separated from the stump and from both stump and upper fragment long thin lathlike splinters projected some of them eight to ten feet in length an inch or two in width and a half to threequarters of an inch in thickness About half a mile to the east of the eastern terminus of this tornadic area the second area of destruction begarl and presented a rectangular area like the first several hundred yards in length but here the conformity with the first ended the forces appearing to have become scattered The circular area was undeveloped the northeast and southeast quadrants being entirely wanting and the northwest quadrant de ectives in so far as the forces acting from north and northwest were concerned The southwest quadrant presented patches of destruction here and there with features similar to those of the like 3uadrant of the first area and here too was a single exception to the order in which the forces everywhere else acted namely a tree thrown from south overlying one from southwest The trees pros trated in the northwest quadrant were thrown from the same directions as those in the southwest as thoughSthe forces acting an this section had burst through the barriers of the central line or finding them defective had swept on through the northwest quadrant thus giving a zigzag shape to this area Appearances seem to indicate that the work of destruction began and progressed throughout all parts of each area almost if not quite stmultaneously During the tornado of Dec 22 I884 in Clarendon County alady percering the approach of the storm was in the act of closing a glazed door which extended down to the floor and opened on a piazza but before she could fasten it the house was enveloped by the tempest the door flew open and she was drawn out and dashed xriolently against the balustrade running around the piazza and re ceived injuries and bruises which confined her to bed for several weeks In the same room there was a heavypine press the door of which was locked This door was burst open torn from its hinges and in the language of the narrator  shivered into kin dling splinters There was no other damage done to the house at least none mentioned I have examined the tracks of three tor nadoes April 23 I883 Feb I9 I884 and Oec 22s I884 and they corresponded so exactly in their various parts that the convic tion is irresistible that the features described especially those indi cating the directions and order in which tlle forces acted will be invariably found in the track of every tornado Notwithstanding the intense atmospheric disturbance which judging from ordinary thunderstorms is of just such a character as to produce vast supplies of electricity the usual electrical mani festationss lightning and thunder are tame and out of all propor tion to the intensity of the atmospheric disturbance in the tornado as compared with an ordinary thunderstorm In the tornado there are never I think any discharges from the clouds to the earth objects are never struck by lightning the thunder whell it occurs is always high up among the clouds and rolls away across the sky in long reverberating peals showing that the static elec tricity is confined to the upper clouds and the supply by no means superabundant What then becomes of the electricity of the lower clouds  Does it remain dormant or does it in someway aid in the destruction  W W ANDERSON MD Stateburg SC The Study of Languages IN the number of Sczence issued July 8 of this year p I9 iS the following passage  The advantages of the ability to read an ordi nary classical author without the aid of a dictionary are so obvious as to need no commentt I was called from home immediately after reading the above hence my delay in seeking from the writer an extended explanation of the means by which the student can read an ordinary Latin author without a dictionary Is there really any practical method by which he can accomplish this except by employing his dictionary so faithfully that he has no further use for it   I do not beliesre an accurate knowledge of a language can be ac quired by reading at sight one page or any number of pages unless the student comprehends the exact signification of each word as he passes it It is true such an exercise increases his facility in under standing the words and sentences he has already studied Reading aloud over and over again what one has already read together with committing to memory poems and passages from prose authors is I believe the best if not the only practical methocl of acquiring an ability of reading Latin or any language at sight H LE Chicago Dec 20 Queries 20 STAR OF BETHLEHEMI see paragraphs going the rounds of the papers about the X Star of Bethlehem that is claimed to be a binary system and to give its maximum light once in three hun dred years Some claim it was the star in the east seen by the wise men Please tell us in Scietce if there is any thing in these rumors and if so where in the heavens the star can be seen JOHN D PARKER Fort Riley Kan Dec 24 2 I  GLOBULAR LIGHTNING The following report from the Hydrographic Office relates to one of the rarest and most inexplica ble forms of lightning Can any of the readers of Science give any information on the subject 2 A globe of fire floats leisurely along in the air in an erratic sort of a course sometimes exploding with great force at other times disappearing without exploding On land it has been observed to go into the ground and then re appear at a short distance and where it entered the soil it left a rugged hole some twenty feet in diameter Although there is no doubt as to the facts regarding the phenomenon no satisfactory explanation of the cause has ever been giaren It is of course en tirely different in character from St Elmos fires so often seen on board vessels cluring thunderstorms these remain stationary at the yardarms and mastheadst and are analogous to the s brush dis charge of an electric machine Captain Moore British steamship  Siberian reportss  Nov I 2 midnight Cape Race bearing west by north Elistant ten miles wind strong south by east a large ball of fire appeared to rise out of the sea to a height of about fifty feet and come right against the wind close up to the ship It then altered its course and ran along with the ship to a distance of about one and onehalf miles In about two minutes it again altered its course and went away to the southeast against the wind It lasted in all not over five minutes Have noticed the same phenomenon before off Cape Race and it seemed to indicate that an easterly or southeasterly gale was coming on

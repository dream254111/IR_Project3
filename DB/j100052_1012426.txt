MUNICIPALITY OF MODERN METHODS OF ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING BY JOHN M WALTON City Controller of Philadelphia Some time ago a prominent banker while discussing with me a prospective bond issue for the City of Philadelphia asked if a state ment could be had of the citys financial condition and the results of its operation I showed him our annual and other reports giving receipts expenditures and indebtedness but he intimated that he wanted to see more than this that he wanted to know what the city owned as well as what it owed the results of its operations each year the distribution of expenditures between permanent improve ments and current expenses Much the same questions in varied form have been put to me a number of times in the last few years and to such an extent that I determined in 1910 to have prepared an inventory of the citys permanent properties as the first step in plac ing the accounts of the city upon an asset and liability revenue and expense and fund basis The inventory was taken by the several departments and bu reaus of the city and county in November and December 1910 The unaudited total of the inventory as shown in the balance sheets at December 31 1910 amounted to 25035135263 The audit of the property inventory which included the taking up of properties not included in the original inventory resulted in a net increase of 1105679691 in the cost value of the unaudited inventory while the acquisition of lands structures nonstructural improvements and equipment during the year 1911 amounted to 950640855 leaving the property account at December 31 1911 amounting to 27091455809 All property was taken up at cost In some few cases where properties were originally returned at an estimated present value instead of at cost this method resulted in a consider able reduction in the audited figures The audit of the inventories was made to ascertain 1 that they had been made by responsible officials and that titles dates and signatures were correct 2 that all city property of a permanent 64Modern Methods of Accounting and Reporting nature had been included and that property not of a permanent nature had been excluded 3 that duplication of properties or entries in error did not exist 4 that all property was correctly described and classified and that clerical inaccuracies did not exist 5 that original cost values as shown were accurate and 6 that present values had been established with due regard to depreciation and obsolescence In determining whether all real estate and improvements had been reported and to eliminate duplications and other errors of entry the cooperation of the Board of Revision of Taxes and the Bureau of Surveys of the Department of Public Works was obtained In arriving at an adequate reserve for depreciation of permanent properties the assessed values of assessable property as determined by the Board of Revision of Taxes was taken as being their present value On all other structures and equipment a reserve based on their estimated life was calculated It is believed that the reserve for depreciation account will be of increasing importance as time goes on and more accurate data are collected bearing upon the varying rates of depreciation upon property When rates of depreciation have been accurately determined they form the most accurate basis for appropriations for the repair and replacement of property result ing from wear and tear and obsolescence An analysis of expenditures by funds general loan and park was begun as of January 1 1911 in order to distinguish between expenditures for expense and expenditures for capital outlays land buildings nonstructural improvements and equipment and to determine the relative use of loan moneys for expenses and general fund moneys for permanent improvements In 1911 the net use of general fund moneys for permanent improvements was 1184 95414 This analysis of expenditures furnishes currently and in detail the acquisition of permanent properties so that the records of the city controllers office may show at all times of what the city is possessed A property ledger contains in several hundred accounts the details that show the cost value of each class and subclass of property A property record contains the respective amounts of property by cost value chargeable to each department and bureau The analysis of expenditures is a first step toward the determi nation of cost of operation This is a new departure in municipal accounting it being thought in the past that exhibits of the cash 65The Annals of the American Academy receipts and expenditures of the government were sufficient to en lighten taxpayers as to the results of operation of their municipal governments If comparison is made between the latest reports of any of our well organized and managed railroads and industrial cor porations and the reports of the same companies going back a period of say thirty years an investigator is astonished at the wealth of detail data bearing upon the cost of operation of each department and division of the enterprise that has been developed in the later reports Revenues are also set forth in great detail The cash statement of receipts and expenditures is rarely if ever seen in modem corporation accounting I am convinced that in order to operate public business as private business is operated and that apparently is the natural evolution that may be expected from the conditions of today it is necessary to develop a system of accounting and report ing that will show year after year for comparative purposes and for efficiency tests the results of municipal operations In working toward this end the analysis of expenditures was commenced which in addition to developing the facts as above stated furnishes a secondary analysis by objects along the lines laid down by President Tafts Commission on Economy and Efficiency Pre viously only the classification by appropriation items for each de partment was available which made difficult if not impossible com parisons between departments and bureaus with a view to efficiency In order to establish and control the asset and liability revenue and expense and fund system of accounting a general ledger was opened as of January 1 1911 This ledger is designed to contain in summary form the accounts necessary to produce a set of financial statements showing the financial condition of the city the condition of its several funds and the results of operations for a given period let us say a month a quarter or a year A summary consolidated balance sheet as of December 31 1911 is here exhibited Many of these accounts in the general ledger control detailed ledgers such as the property taxes receivable water rents receivable miscellaneous accounts receivable appropriation and contract ledgers The purpose of the detail ledgers is to show the condition of each of a large class of accounts that are represented by one controlling account in the general ledger Thus arranged the detail ledgers may be proven periodically to their respective controlling accounts in the general ledger by means of a trial balance

depart ment the keeping of twentytwo appropriation ledgers and twenty two contract ledgers which were previously distributed among all the auditors has been assigned to two of the auditors as their exclusive work The other auditors are thus left free to give their entire time and attention to auditing work The concentration of the bookkeeping has greatly facilitated the preparation of reports upon the condition of appropriations balances and contract reserves Beginning with January 1912 reports have been made to city councils monthly showing the condition of each item of appropria tion

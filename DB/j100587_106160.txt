8 1773 XXXII AN ACCOUNT OF THE TOKAY AND OTHER WINES OF HUNGARY BY SYLVESTER DOUGLASS ESQUIRE COMMUNICATED BY EDWARD POORE ESQ F R S A S THE GROWTH QUANTITY AND VALUE OF THE TOKAY WINE ARE LITTLE KNOWN IN THIS COUNTRY AND THE POPULAR NOTIONS CONCERNING THEM ARE IN GENERAL ERRONEOUS IT MAY BE A MATTER BOTH OF SOME CURIOSITY AND USE TO THROW TOGETHER WHAT I WAS ABLE TO COLLECT ON THIS SUBJECT IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT GROWS AS WELL AS FROM THE CHIEF PROPRIETORS OF IT BOTH IN HUNGARY AND AT VIENNA I SHALL SUBJOIN A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE OTHER MOST RE MARKABLE HUNGARIAN WINES READ JUNE 10 1773 THE TOWN OR RATHER VILLAGE OF TOKAY FROM WHENCE THIS CELEBRATED WINE DERIVES ITS NAME STANDS AT THE FOOT AND TO THE EAST OF A HIGH HILL CLOSE BY THE CONFLUX OF THE RIVER BODRUG WITH THE THEIS OR TIBISCUS IN THE NORIMBERG MAP OF HUNGARY IT IS ERRONEOUSLY PLACED BETWEEN THESE RIVERS FOR IT IS ON THE WEST SIDE OF BOTH THE INHABITANTS ARE CHIEFLY EITHER HUNGARIANS OF THE PROTESTANT RELIGION OR GREEKS WHO CAME ORIGINALLY FROM TURKEY BUT HAVE GEOGRAPHY293 HAVE BEEN LONG SETTLED HERE FOR THE PURPOSE OF CARRY ING ON THE WINE TRADE DURING THE TWO LAST CEN TURIES THIS COUNTRY BEING ALMOST THE CONSTANT THEATRE OF WAR THERE WAS A CITADEL NEAR THE TOWN BUT NOW THERE IS NOT THE SMALLEST VESTIGE OF IT REMAINING THE HILLS ON WHICH THE WINE GROWS LIE ALL TO THE WEST OF THE RIVER BODROG AND BEGINNING CLOSE BY THE TOWN OF TOKAY EXTEND WESTWARD AND NORTHWARD FROM THENCE AND OCCUPY A SPACE OF PERHAPS TEN ENGLISH MILES SQUARE BUT THEY ARE INTERRUPTED AND INTERSPERSED WITH A GREAT MANY EXTENSIVE PLAINS AND SEVERAL VILLAGES SUCH AS TALIA MADA TARCZAL SZOM BOR BENYE AND TOLESWA NEAR SOME OF THESE PAR TICULARLY TALIA AND TARCZAL THE WINE IS BETTER THAN WHAT GROWS ON THE HILL OF TOKAY BUT IT ALL GOES UN DER THE SAME GENERAL NAME THE VINEYARDS EXTEND BEYOND THE 48TH DEGREE OF LATITUDE NORTHERN LATITUDE THE SOIL ON ALL THE HILLS WHERE THE WINE GROWS SOIL IS A YELLOW CLAYISH EARTH EXTREMELY DEEP AND THERE ARE INTERSPERSED THROUGH IT LARGE LOOSE STONES WHICH AS I WAS TOLD ARE LIMESTONE BUT I HAD NOT AN OP PORTUNITY OF EXAMINING THEM AS THE HILLS DO NOT RUN IN A REGULAR CHAIN BUT ARE EXPOSURE SCATTERED AMONG THE INTERVENING PLAINS YOU MEET WITH ALL KINDS OF EXPOSURES UPON THEM AND THERE IS WINE ON THEM ALL EXCEPT PERHAPS WHERE THEY ARE TURNED DIRECTLY TOWARDS THE SOUTH YET THE GENERAL RULE IS THAT THE EXPOSURES MOST INCLINING TO THE SOUTH THE STEEPEST DECLIVITIES AND THE HIGHEST PART OF THOSE DECLIVITIES PRODUCE THE BEST WINE THESE CIRCUMSTANCES SHEW THE ADVANTAGE OF CHOOSING YOUR WINE ON THE GROUND THE LATE MR WORTLYE MON Q Q 2 TAGUE294 TAGUE WAS SO WELL CONVINCED OF THIS THAT A FEW YEARS BEFORE HIS DEATH HE UNDERTOOK A JOURNEY FROM ENGLAND TO TOKAY AND CONTINUED THERE SEVERAL MONTHS IN ORDER TO BE SURE OF HAVING THE BEST AND MOST GENUINE WINE IT IS A VULGAR ERROR THAT THE TOKAY WINE IS IN SO SMALL QUANTITY AS NEVER TO BE FOUND GENUINE UNLESS WHEN GIVEN IN PRESENTS BY THE COURT OF VIENNA THE EXTENT OF GROUND ON WHICH IT GROWS IS A SUFFICIENT PROOF TO THE CONTRARY IT IS A COMMON DESERT WINE IN ALL THE GREAT FAMILIES AT VIENNA AND IN HUNGARY AND IS VERY GENERALLY DRANK IN POLAND AND RUSSIA BEING USED AT TABLE IN THOSE COUNTRIES LIKE MADEIRA IN THIS QUANTITY ANOTHER VULGAR ERROR IS THAT ALL THE TOKAY WINE IS THE PROPERTY OF THE EMPRESS QUEEN SHE IS NOT EVEN THE MOST CONSIDERABLE PROPRIETOR NOR OF THE BEST WINE SO THAT EVERY YEAR SHE SELLS OFF HER OWN AND PURCHASES FROM THE OTHER PROPRIETORS TO SUPPLY HER OWN TABLE AND THE PRESENTS SHE MAKES OF IT THE GREATEST PROPRIETOR IS THE PRINCE TRAUTZON AN OLD MAN AT WHOSE DEATH INDEED HIS ESTATE WILL ESCHEAT TO THE CROWN BUT MANY OTHERS OF THE GERMAN AND HUNGARIAN NOBILITY HAVE LARGE VINEYARDS AT TOKAY MOST OF THE GENTLEMEN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HAVE PART OF THEIR ESTATES THERE THE JESUITS COLLEGE AT UNGWAR HAS A CONSIDERABLE SHARE OF THE BEST WINE AND BESIDES THESE THERE ARE MANY OF THE PEASANTS WHO HAVE VINEYARDS WHICH THEY HOLD OF THE QUEEN OR OTHER LORDS BY PAYING A TYTHE OF THE ANNUAL PRO DUCE PROPRIETORS THERE IS NEVER ANY RED WINE MADE AT TOKAY AND AS FAR AS I RECOLLECT THE GRAPES ARE ALL WHITE THEY GRAPES295 THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A PARTICULAR FLAVOUR WHICH I OWN I COULD NOT PERCEIVE THOUGH THEY WERE BE GINNING TO BE RIPE WHEN I WAS THERE IN THE END OF AUGUST 1768 AND I HAVE OFTEN EAT OF SUCH AS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO VIENNA THE VINTAGE IS ALWAYS AS LATE AS POSSIBLE IT COM MONLY BEGINS AT THE FEAST OF ST SIMON AND JUDE OCTOBER 28 SOMETIMES AS LATE AS ST MARTINS NO VEMBER 11 THIS IS DETERMINED BY THE SEASON FOR THEY HAVE THE GRAPES ON THE VINES AS LONG AS THE WEATHER PERMITS AS THE FROSTS WHICH FROM THE END OF AUGUST ARE VERY KEEN DURING THE NIGHTS ARE THOUGHT TO BE OF GREAT SERVICE TO THE WINE BY THIS MEANS IT HAPPENS THAT WHEN THE VINTAGE BEGINS A GREAT MANY OF THE GRAPES ARE SHRIVELLED AND HAVE IN SOME MEASURE THE APPEARANCE OF DRIED RAISINS VINTAGE THERE ARE FOUR SORTS OF WINE MADE FROM THE SAME GRAPES WHICH THEY DISTINGUISH AT TOKAY BY THE NAMES OF ESSENCE AUSPRUCH MASSLASCH AND THE COMMON WINE DIFFERENT SORTS THE PROCESS FOR MAKING THEM IS AS FOLLOWS THE HALFDRIED AND SHRIVELED GRAPES BEING CARE FULLY PICKED OUT FROM THE OTHERS ARE PUT INTO A PER FORATED VESSEL WHERE THEY REMAIN AS LONG AS ANY JUICE RUNS OFF BY THE MERE PRESSURE OF THEIR OWN WEIGHT THIS IS PUT INTO SMALL CASKS AND IS CALLED THE ES SENCE 1 THE ES SENCE ON THE GRAPES FROM WHICH THE ESSENCE HAS RUN OFF IS POURED THE EXPRESSED JUICE OF THE OTHERS FROM WHICH THEY HAD BEEN PICKED AND THEN THEY TREAD THEM WITH THEIR FEET THE LIQUOR OBTAINED IN THIS MANNER STANDS TO FERMENT DURING A DAY OR TWO AFTER WHICH IT IS POURED INTO SMALL CASKS WHICH ARE KEPT IN 2 AUSPRUCH296 IN THE AIR FOR ABOUT A MONTH AND AFTERWARDS PUT INTO THE CELLARS THIS IS THE AUSPRUCH THE SAME PROCESS IS AGAIN REPEATED BY THE AD DITION OF MORE OF THE COMMON JUICE TO THE GRAPES WHICH HAVE ALREADY UNDERGONE THE TWO FORMER PRES SURES ONLY THEY ARE NOW ALSO WRUNG WITH THE HANDS AND THIS GIVES THE MASSLASCH  3 MASSLASCH THE FOURTH KIND IS MADE BY TAKING ALL THE GRAPES TOGETHER AT FIRST AND SUBMITTING THEM TO THE GREATEST PRESSURE IT IS CHIEFLY PREPARED BY THE PEASANTS WHO HAVE NOT A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF GRAPES AND CANNOT AFFORD THE TIME AND APPARATUS NECESSARY FOR MAKING THE DIFFERENT SORTS IT IS I BELIEVE ENTIRELY CON SUMED IN THE COUNTRY AND FORMS THE COMMON VIN DU PAIS THE FOURTH KIND THE ESSENCE IS THICK AND NEVER PERFECTLY CLEAR VERY SWEET AND LUSCIOUS IT IS CHIEFLY USED TO MIX WITH THE OTHER KINDS AND WHEN JOINED TO THE MAS SLASCH FORMS A WINE EQUALLY GOOD WITH THE AUS PRUCH AND OFTEN SOLD FOR IT THE AUSPRUCH IS THE WINE COMMONLY EXPORTED AND WHAT IS KNOWN IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES UNDER THE NAME OF TOKAY THE FOLLOWING ARE THE BEST RULES FOR JUDGING OF IT THOUGH IN THIS AND ALL SIMILAR CASES IT REQUIRES EXPERIENCE TO BE ABLE TO PUT SUCH RULES IN PRACTICE 1 THE COLOUR SHOULD NEITHER BE REDDISH WHICH IT OFTEN IS NOR VERY PALE BUT A LIGHT SILVER 2 IN TRYING IT YOU SHOULD NOT SWALLOW IT IMME DIATELY BUT ONLY WET YOUR PALATE AND THE TIP OF THE  I CANNOT ANSWER FOR THE ORTHOGRAPHY OF THIS AND THE FORE GOING TERM HAVING WRITTEN THEM BY THE EAR AS THEY WERE PRONOUNCED TONGUE297 TONGUE IF IT DISCOVER ANY ACRIMONY TO THE TONGUE OR BITE IT IT IS NOT GOOD THE TASTE OUGHT TO BE SOFT AND MILD 3 IT SHOULD WHEN POURED OUT FORM GLOBULES IN THE GLASS AND HAVE AN OILY APPEARANCE 4 WHEN GENUINE THE STRONGEST IS ALWAYS OF THE BEST QUALITY 5 WHEN SWALLOWED IT SHOULD HAVE AN EARTHY ASTRIN GENT TASTE IN THE MOUTH WHICH THEY CALL THE TASTE OF THE ROOT THE POLES PARTICULARLY ARE FOND OF THIS ASTRIN GENCY AND AUSTERITY IN THEIR TOKAY THERE IS SO GREAT A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TOKAY USED IN POLAND AND WHAT I DRANK BOTH AT TOKAY AND VIENNA WHICH I AM SURE WAS OF THE BEST AND MOST GENUINE KIND THAT I AM INCLINED TO THINK THEIR WINE IS COMPOSED OF THE MASSLASCH WHICH BY THE SEVERE PRESSURE IT SUFFERS MUST CARRY WITH IT MUCH OF THE ASTRINGENT QUALITY WHICH IN ALL GRAPES RESIDES IN THE SKIN AND A SMALLER PROPORTION THAN USUAL OF THE ESSENCE BUT THIS IS MERE CONJECTURE BESIDES THE QUALITIES ALREADY MENTIONED ALL TOKAY WINE HAS AN AROMATIC TASTE SO PECULIAR THAT NOBODY WHO HAS EVER DRANK IT GENUINE CAN CONFOUND IT WITH ANY OTHER SPECIES OF WINE THE ONLY SPECIES THAT BEARS A RESEMBLANCE TO IT GROWS IN A VERY SMALL QUAN TITY IN THE VENETIAN FRIULE AND IS ONLY TO BE MET WITH IN PRIVATE FAMILIES AT VENICE WHERE IN THE DIALECT OF THE PLACE IT IS CALLED VIN PICCOLIT THE TOKAY WINE BOTH THE ESSENCE AND AUSPRUCH KEEPS TO ANY AGE AND IMPROVES BY TIME I HAVE DRANK OF THE LATTER AT VIENNA WHICH HAD BEEN IN THE SAME CELLAR SINCE THE YEAR 1686 IT IS NEVER GOOD TILL IT IS ABOUT THREE YEARS OLD ALL AGE298 ALL THE SORTS ARE GENERALLY KEPT IN SMALL CAKS CALLED ANTHEILS WHICH LEGALLY HOLD 80 HUNGARIAN MEDIAE A MEASURE CONTAINING ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF AN ENGLISH QUART WHEN YOU BUY IT OF THE GENTLEMEN WHO ARE PROPRIETORS YOU HAVE COMMONLY MORE THAN THE LEGAL QUANTITY IN THE ANTHEIL IF FROM THE GREEK MERCHANTS ALWAYS LESS MEASURE THE PARTICULAR YEAR OR VINTAGE AND THE AGE VARY THE PRICE OF THIS AS OF ALL OTHER WINES PRICE THE MEDIUM PRICE OF THE ANTHEIL OF ESSENCE IS BETWEEN 60 AND 70 DUCATS IT IS SOMETIMES SOLD ON THE SPOT FOR MORE THAN 100 PRINCE RADZIVIL PAID 300 DUCATS FOR TWO ANTHEILS ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN THE PRICE IS 60 DUCATS AND THE ANTHEIL LARGE MEASURE THAT IS ABOUT 90 MEDIAE IT IS EXACTLY A DUCAT THE ENGLISH QUART THE PRICE OF THE AUSPRUCH IS FROM 26 TO ABOUT 30 DUCATS THE ANTHEIL THIS IS AT THE RATE OF TWO FLORINS OR NEAR A CROWN THE ENGLISH QUART THE EMPRESS QUEEN A LITTLE BEFORE I WAS AT TOKAY PURCHASED SOME OF VINTAGE 1754 AT 33 DUCATS AND THIS WAS LOOKED UPON AS AN EXTRAORDINARY PRICE THE VARIETY IN THE PRICES OF THE ESSENCE AND AUSPRUCH ACCOUNTS FOR THE OPPOSITE RELATIONS OF PEOPLE WHO SAY SOMETIMES THAT IT COSTS HALF A GUINEA SOMETIMES FIVE SHILLINGS ON THE SPOT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO COME EVERY YEAR FROM PO LAND ABOUT THE TIME OF THE VINTAGE TO CHOOSE THEIR OWN WINE ON THE GROUND AND SEE IT CAREFULLY MA NAGED BUT IT IS A FALSE OPINION OF MANY THAT THEY CONTRACT FOR THE WINE OF SEVERAL YEARS FORWARDS NO SUCH THING HAS EVER BEEN PRACTISED FOR THESE LAST TWENTY YEARS THE COURT OF PETERSBOURG HAS HAD AN 6 AGENT299 AGENT WHO RESIDES CONSTANTLY AT TOKAY FOR THE PUR POSE OF BUYING WINE THE PRESENT AGENT IS A MAJOR IN THE RUSSIAN SERVICE AND FORMERLY WAS A MAJOR GENERAL HE COMMONLY PURCHASES EVERY YEAR FROM 40 TO 60 ANTHEILS OF AUSPRUCH BUT NEVER OF ANY OTHER SORT ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL PROPRIETORS WHO RESIDES AT CASCHAW  TOLD ME THAT HE WOULD ENGAGE TO DE LIVER THE BEST OLD TOKAY I E AUSPRUCH IN BOTTLES AT LONDON FOR A DUCAT A BOTTLE CONTAINING TWO THIRDS OF A QUART OR CONSIDERABLY CHEAPER IN CASK AND WOULD PUT HIS OWN SEAL ON IT AND INSURE IT IT IS MUCH THE BEST WAY TO TRANSPORT IT IN CASKS FOR WHEN IT IS ON THE SEAS IT FERMENTS THREE TIMES EVERY SEASON AND REFINES ITSELF BY THESE REPEATED FERMENTA TIONS WHEN IN BOTTLES THERE MUST BE AN EMPTY SPACE LEFT BETWEEN THE WINE AND THE CORK OTHERWISE IT WOULD BURST THE BOTTLE THEY PUT A LITTLE OIL ON THE SURFACE AND TIE A PIECE OF BLADDER ON THE CORK THE BOTTLES ARE ALWAYS LAID ON THEIR SIDES IN SAND I AM PERSUADED AN ENGLISH MERCHANT OR COMPANY OF MERCHANTS WOULD FIND THEIR ACCOUNT IN ESTABLISH ING A CORRESPONDENCE WITH ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL PRO PRIETORS IN THE COUNTRY OR IN SENDING AN AGENT TO RESIDE AT TOKAY WHO MIGHT WATCH THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE GOOD VINTAGES CHOOSE THE BEST EXPOSURES AND BARGAIN WITH THE PROPRIETORS THEMSELVES THEY SHOULD HAVE CELLARS THERE TO KEEP THE WINE TO A PROPER AGE AND AN AGENT AT WARSAW AND ANOTHER AT DANTZIC TO RECEIVE IT THIS IS THE ROAD IT MUST TAKE THE CARRIAGE AS I WAS INFORMED FROM TOKAY TO THE FRON  THE BARON VESEY PRESIDENT OF THE CHAMBER OF CASCHAW V O L LXIII R R TIERS300 TIERS OF POLAND COSTS THE POLISH MERCHANTS TWO DUCATS THE ANTHEIL AND THREE FLORINS OF DUTY THE DUTIES IN POLAND AMOUNT TO ABOUT 14 FLORINS THE ANTHEIL THE CARRIAGE DOWN THE VISTULA CANNOT BE VERY EX PENSIVE EVERY CHARGE INCLUDED I AM PERSUADED THE BEST OLD TOKAY MIGHT BE SOLD IN LONDON AT HALF A GUINEA THE QUART BOTTLE WHICH IS 100 PER CENT LESS THAN WHAT THE WORST OFTEN COSTS OF THE OTHER HUNGARIAN WINES THERE IS NOT I BELIEVE IN EUROPE ANY COUNTRY WHICH PRODUCES A GREATER VARIETY OF WINES THAN HUN GARY I HAVE BEEN TOLD AT VIENNA OF AN ENTERTAIN MENT GIVEN TO THE EMPRESS QUEEN AT PRESBURG BY AN HUNGARIAN NOBLEMAN WHERE THERE WERE ABOVE A HUNDRED DIFFERENT SORTS OF WINE PRODUCED ALL THE GROWTH OF THAT COUNTRY MANY OF THEM ARE OF AN EXCELLENT QUALITY AND WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY BE A SOURCE OF GREAT COMMERCE AND RICHES TO THAT KINGDOM IF IT ENJOYED A MARITIME INSTEAD OF ITS INLAND SITUATION THE MOST VALUABLE WHITE WINES AFTER THE TOKAY ARE 1 THE ST GEORGE WINE WHICH GROWS NEAR A VIL LAGE OF THAT NAME ABOUT TWO GERMAN MILES NORTH OF PRESBURG AND IN THE SAME LATITUDE WITH VIENNA THIS WINE APPROACHES THE NEAREST OF ANY HUNGARIAN WINE TO TOKAY FORMERLY THEY USED TO MAKE AUS PRUCH AT ST GEORGE BUT THIS WAS PROHIBITED BY THE COURT ABOUT SIXTEEN YEARS AGO IT BEING SUPPOSED THAT IT MIGHT HURT THE TRAFFIC OF THE TOKAY WINE THE PROHIBITION SHEWS THAT THE METHOD OF PREPARING THE301 THE TOKAY IS THOUGHT TO HAVE A SHARE IN ITS PECULIAR QUALITIES 2 THE EDENBURG WINE RESEMBLING THE ST GEORGE BUT INFERIOR IN QUALITY AND VALUE EDENBURG IS A TOWN SITUATE ABOUT NINE GERMAN MILES NORTHWEST OF PRESBURG 3 THE CARLOWITZ WINE SOMETHING LIKE THAT OF THE COTE ROTIE ON THE BANKS OF THE RHONE CARLOWITZ IS THE SEAT OF THE METROPOLITAN OF THE GREEK CHURCH IN HUNGARY IT STANDS ON THE BANKS OF THE DANUBE BETWEEN 45 AND 46 DEGREES OF LATITUDE THE BEST RED WINES ARE 1 THE BUDA WINE WHICH GROWS IN THE NEIGH BOURHOOD OF THE ANTIENT CAPITAL OF THE KINGDOM THIS WINE IS LIKE AND PERHAPS EQUAL TO BURGUNDY AND IS OFTEN SOLD FOR IT IN GERMANY A GERMAN  AUTHOR OF THE LAST CENTURY SAYS THAT A GREAT QUANTITY OF THIS WINE USED TO BE SENT TO ENGLAND IN THE REIGN OF JAMES I OVER LAND BY BRESLAW AND HAMBURG AND THAT IT WAS THE FAVOURITE WINE BOTH AT COURT AND ALL OVER ENGLAND 2 THE SEXARD WINE A STRONG DEEPCOLOURED WINE NOT UNLIKE THE STRONG WINE OF LANGUEDOC WHICH IS SAID TO BE SOLD AT BORDEAUX FOR CLARET THE SEXARD WINE ON THE SPOT COSTS ABOUT 5 CREUZERS OR 212 D A BOTTLE IT BELONGS TO THE ABBOT OF CONSTANCE AND IS CHIEFLY CONSUMED IN GERMANY SEXARD IS ON THE DANUBE BETWEEN BUDA AND ESSEH 3 THE ERLAW WINE WHICH IS RECKONED AT VIENNA ALMOST EQUAL TO THAT OF BUDA ERLAW IS IN UPPER  HEVELIUS SILESIOGRAPH 2 VOLS ART BRESLAW R R 2 HUNGARY302 HUNGARY SOUTHWEST OF TOKAY BETWEEN 47 AND 48 DEGREES OF LATITUDE 4 THE GROS WARDEIN WINE A STRONG BODIED WINE AND VERY CHEAP IT BELONGS CHIEFLY TO THE DUKE OF MODENA WHOSE ANCESTOR GOT A LARGE ESTATE IN THIS COUNTRY IN GRANT FROM THE EMPEROR LEOPOLD AS A REWARD FOR HIS SERVICES IN THE HUNGARIAN WARS GROS WARDEIN IS AN OLD FORTRESS NEAR THE CONFINES OF TRAN SYLVANIA BETWEEN 46 AND 47 DEGREES OF LATITUDE XXXIII ON

would cle teriorate As it stands it may fearlessly challenge comparison with similar work by any European nation in precision elegance and economy Its work is for all time A RECORD of the opening and closing of navi gation at York Factory Hudsons Bay extend ing from 1828 to 1880 has been communicated by W Woods of the HudsonsBay company The latest date of open water in spring is June 1  the earliest closing of navigation Nov 3 The earliest opening was May 4 the latest closing Dec 9 The season then extends over from five to seven months with an average of six months open water The time when navigation would be available is limited however by the time of open water in Hudsons Straits by which the bay is reached This comprises only July August and September and possibly part of October but exact ad vices are not yet attainable The question of the navigability of the HudsonsBay route to Europe is of vast importance for the settlers of Manitoba and the Saskatchewan since if it be available they can by a comparatively short railwaytransit reach tidewater with their crops which otherwise cannot possibly com pete with those of the northwestern United States It is understood that a trial is to be made of the route and that a reconnoissance of Hudsons Bay of which there are no good charts will shortly be attempted LETTERS TO THE EDITOR ss Correspondents are requested to be as brief as possible The writers name is in all cases required as proof of good faith The deepsea fish Malacosteus IN reading the translation of Mr Filhols article on the deepsea fishes collected by the Talisman Science May 23 I have been somewhat surprised by recog nizing in A Tissaidiers figure of Malacosteuts niger an old acquaintance the source of which may be ob served in Bost journ nat hist vi plate v While upon this subject of Malacosteus it may be interesting to note that in several specimens of M niger now in the National museum the slender band conlnecting the tongue with the mandibular symphy sis which has long been regarded as a tangled hyoid NCE 747 barbel is really not free at either end and may be only a muscle concerned in the movement of the lower jaw I have not yet been able to find a true hyoid barbel The pectoral contains three rays in stead of five as counted by Dr Ayres and the caudal is forked and not convex TARLETON I BEAN Curator departnment offishes U S

Science et nature Those on p 621 came from the latter journal the others from the former but not all of them in connection with the article translated  ED  A bad habit of the foxsquirrel Sciurus niger var ludovicianus Madison people pride themselves not a little on the nunmber and tameness of their foxsquirrels which are found by scores in the shadetrees of the capitol park and the residence streets of the city Protected by a special ordinance they have multi plied rapidly and scarcely know what fear is run ning along before one on the sidewalk or fence and occasionally even stopping and allowing themselves to be touched in the hope of getting a nut We con sider them decidedly more ornamental and worthy of good treatment than the ubiquitous bluejay or sparrow and never tire of watching their pretty ways But today I noticed several engaged in far less commendable business than hiding or opening acorns While passing under a row of elms my attention was attracted by a number of short twigs lying on the sidewalk About a hundred were counted under the first tree They were of nearly uniform size six or eight inches long including the young growth of the season and a short piece of last years wood with one or two bunches of the nearly ripe fruit After a gale in the early fall the ground under the white elms is sometimes covered with leafy branches of about the same size which separate by a joint at the site of a former winter bud like the socalled brittle branches of poplars and willows which they also resemble in being a sort of natural cuttings serving in part for propagation1 In the present in stance however the ends of the twigs did not show the smooth surface of those which fall naturally and as there was no indication of the work of a pruner I turned my attention to the top of the tree where it was directed by a twig falling just as I looked up Following its course I saw a squirrel comfortably seated on one of the upper branches busily at work on the fruit of a second twig which was soon dropped for another No less than five were broken off in a single minute and while I watched the falling twigs averaged one a minute They were dexter ously snapped off just below the fruitcluster a bite or two often helping in the operation The seed was removed from each of the small samaras by a single adroit cut on one side and long before the rifled branch had reached the ground another was under going the same fate The dinner of this one squir 1 Frank devotes a few pages of his Krankheiten der pflan zen pp 34 35 to this spontaneous pruning which he considers a means of removing weakly twigs after their vegetative period is ended Its occurrence is mentioned as especially noticeable in Taxodium Quercus Populus and Salix but not by any means confined to these genera

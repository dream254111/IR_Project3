May 3 181 THIS earth is found in many places of New Jersey not usually of a blue colour when dug up but acquiring that colou after being exposed to the air I do not enter into any geo logical details because I have reason to believe this part of the subject will occupy the attention of a member of this so ciety better qualified from local knowledge to treat it than I am I offer to the Society the following experiments because I think the nature of the substance has been mistaken External Characters ist It has a moderately deep smaltblue colour neither verging toward copperred like indigo and Prussian blue nor toward green like mountain blue and blue fluor d Its appearance to the eye is earthy 3d When breathed upon it gives out a sliglit earthy odour 4th It is moderately hard when scratched by the point or edge of a common penknife the streak is bluish and dusty from the knife penetrating the substance of the stone but Nvhen scratched by the back of the knife or by the nail the streak is greyishwhite and shining B b194 ANALYSIS OF THE 5th It breaks with a fracture somewhat conchoidal 6th It adheres to the tongue with some force 7tlh When a drop of oil is poured on it the colour becomes black or of a deep blue approaching to black so that it pro mises to be useful as a pigment 8th Its specific gravity is 25338 9th It absorbs 35 per cent of water on immersion in that fluid Its Habitudes when exposed to Heat 1oth Before the blowpipe whether supported by char coal or on the bottom of a crucible it becomes of a brown colour and then melts into a shining greyish globule not attractable by the magnet unless this treatment with charcoal be continued 1 ith When this stone in powder is distilled at a low red heat for an hour in close vessels with a pneumatic appara tus no gas is collected except the common air expelled by rarefaction from the containing vessel moisture arises which by means of a cold atmosphere is condensed into pure water exhibiting no chemical qualities on dropping a drop of it into muriate of baryta or diluted tincture of galls The powder thus distilled loses from 23 to 24 per cent when the distilla tion has been urged i2th On calcining o00 grains in a full red heat for an hour 80 to 81 grains of a bright brown powder are procured con sisting as will be seen partly of the brownred oxyde of iron and partly of alumina 13th This calcined brown powder when treated in a cru cible with charcoal or when made into a paste vith wax and burnt three several times yielded 48 grains of iron by means of a magnet and there were left behind six and a half grains of a powder not acted upon by the magnet rhis last being dissolved in sulphuric acid diluted and precipitated by car bonate of ammonia possessed the common characters of aluminaBLUE IRON EARTH OF NEW JERSEY 195 14th When fused in small proportion with potash for the purpose of discovering the presence of manganese the trace of green colour was too slight to indicate any appreciable quantity of that substance Its Habitudes with Solvents 15th This stone does not dissolve perceptibly in pure rain water at the common temperature of the atmosphere nor does the water in which it has been infused exhibit any colour when tested by galls or triple prussiate of potass nor does it afford any precipitate by carbonat of potass 16th The sulphuric the nitric and tlhe muriatic acids dropt on this stone excite no effervescence they are diffused onit and sink into it 17dth It is not easily dissolved in sulphuric acid without the aid of moderate heat I used the top of the common ten plate stove of about 1500 of Fahrenheit butwith heat and after some hours digestion it becomes a white mass with this acid which mass is soluble entirely in boiling water pro ducing a clear solution there is no effervescence during the solution 18th Having dissolved 50 grains of the stone in sulphuric acid and diluted the solution with hot water I added a fil tered solution of triple prussiat of potass made in the common way by digesting carbonat of potass on Prussian blue till the latter no loniger became discoloured On continuing to add this while any precipitate appeared I obtained a quantity of the most intense and beautiful Prussian blue which when cal cined in a full red heat for an hour yielded forty grains of red oxyd The remaining liquor after filtration and precipitation by carbonat of ammonia afforded a precipitate which when carefully filtered and moderately dried weiglhed about 4 12 grainis it was alumina It weighed less in proportion tban the alumina of experiment 13 in consequence of not being so much dried The quantity thus obtained of iron and alumina 2196 ANALYSIS OF THE is probably not quite accurate owing to the iron contained in the triple prussiat but very near the truth 19oth This stone when powdered dissolves in nitric acid in the warm atmosphere of a summers day after 10 or 12 hours digestion without residuum 20th This nitric solution was evaporated to perfect dry ness the powdered residuum was digested in fresh nitric acid which was again evaporated to dryness A third portion of the same acid was now poured on the brownred powder and digested on it about iioth was dissolved as appeared on drying and weighing the residuum The solution mode rately diluted and filtered exhibited but very slight shades of colour with tincture of galls and solution of triple prussiat of potass so that but a trace of iron was taken up as was ori ginally presumed and intended The digestion in nitric acid and drivinog it off by heat being meant for the purpose of oxyding the iron beyond the point of solubility in that acid The last portion of nitric acid therefore took up nothiing but the earths These being precipitated by carbonat of anmmo nia afforded about nine per cent of earth when dried at the heat of 150 Fahrenheit and consisted entirely of alumina 21st Muriatic acid dissolves this stone by heat The solu tion is of a brownislyellow colour It leaves no residuum 22d Oxalic acid and oxalat of ammonia occasion no pre cipitate from any of these solutions hence there is no trace of any of the alkaline earths Experiments to discover the Presence of Puissic fkid in this Stone 23d Carbonat of potass digested on the powdered stone takes away the colour but does not dissolve the substance The solution of carbonat of potass so digested on the stone in fine powder being filtered produced no blue precipitate when poured into a solution of sulphat of iron 24th A piece of this stone suspended for many hours in a solution of sulphat of iron diffused no trace of blue colourBLUE IRON EARTH OP NEW JERSEY 197 either when immersed dry or moistened with an alkaline solution 20th The following experiment was suggested and made for me by Mr Cloud who appears to have investigated the properties of palladium more fully than any other clhenmist The nitromuriat of palladium and the nitromuriat of gold are not precipitated by the chromat of potass but they are precipitated by the prussiats When the red oxyd of mercury is triturated with Prussian blue and boiled with water for half an hour a prussiat of mercury is formed whicli occasions a fawncoloured precipitate whien added even in a very minute portion to the nitromuriat of palladium this precipitate is a prussiat of palladium Red oxyd of mercury was inixed with the blue earth in fine powder and water being added to the mixture was boiled in a sandbath for more than half an hour and constantly stirred during the time when cool the liquor was filtered and dropped into a nitromuriatic solu tion of palladium but no precipitate appeared Experiments to ascertain the Presence of Phosphoric Acid PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS When the native green phosphat of lead is melted before the flame of the blowpipe on charcoal it chrystallizeg on cooling into a polyhedral garnetlike kind of chrystallized mass so does the artificial phosphat of lead made by adding phosphat of soda to nitrat or acetat of lead in which case the phosphat of lead precipitates in a dense white powder speedily and distinctly These remarks have been made by Klaproth in his Analysis of the Phosphated Lead Ores When nitrat of lead or acetat of lead are added to any solution containiing phosphoric acid the solution of lead is instantly decomposed and a phosphat of lead is formed Thus when phosphat of iron made either directly by solution in phosphoric acid or by precipitation by phosphate of soda is dissolved even in small quantity in the nitric acid this goluAp198 ANALYSIS OF THE tion is immediately precipitated by any solution of lead these facts were previously ascertained Moreover solutions of iron in phosphoric acid were made both directly and by double decomposition as by precipitating a solution of sulphat of iron by phosphat of soda The phos phat of iron inboth cases when dried moderately assumes a slight bluish tinge by exposure to the atmosphere which may have led to the supposition of this blue stone being phos phat of iron These previous experiments were made to ascertain the colour of artificial phosphat of iron With these facts in view a solution of the blue iron earth or stone was made in pure nitric acid freed from muriatic acid by nitrat of silver and from sulphuric acid by nitrat of baryta precautions which were afterwards found unnecessary for this particular purpose the common nitric acid of com merce answering sufficiently well This nitrated solution of the substance under analysis was mixed gradually with nitrat of lead and subsequently in a distinct experiment with acetat of lead In neither case was there any precipitate produced as might have been expected to take place had even a trace of phosphoric acid combined or unconmbined existed in this nitric solution Again a considerable quantity of the substance in powder dried but not discoloured was rubbed up with about 1loth of its weight of lampblack in another experiment with i loth of sulphur in a tlhird experiment witlh 1loth of a a mixture of lampblack and sulphur The mixed powder was put into bottleshaped crucibles lhaving clay stoppers with a glass tube of about 116th of an inch diameter passishg through the stopper The clay wasburned to fit the aperture and during the experiments the stoppers were also well luted and attended toThe mixtures were exposed to a gradual heat for half an hour to dissipate the hygrometrical moisture if any should remain The stoppers constantly examined the heat was gradually increased to a full red at the close of an hour during this time a lighted paper was very fre quently applied to the orifice of the glass tubes whence theBLUE IRON EARTH OF NEW JERSEY 199 vapours from the blue earth issued but there was no trace of any thing inflammable to be discovered Nor was any the slightest lhosphorescence discovered on dropping the pow dered stone on red hot charcoal Hence I conclude ist Trhat the hard blue earth of New Jersey is probably the same substance with the blue earth of Jamison and Wer ner the fer azure of Hauy and the fer phosphate of Brochant and Brogniart but it seems to differ somewhat from the smaltblue fossil of the Vorau analysed by Klaproth 2d That this blue earth of New Jersey contains neither prussic or phosphoric acid 3d That it consists of suboxyd of iron intimately united with about 11oth of the earth of alum and 24 per cent of water probably in chemical union 4th rhat it contains no perceptible quantity of silica lime magnesia or the other earths 5th That its colour may be of vegetable origin but I cannot venture any probable surmise concerning it The chrystallized earth of New Jersey consisting of olive green chrystals upon a bluish green earthy stone is very similar in its geological and chemical characters to the blue earth just described but as I propose a more perfect analysis of these chrystals than I have yet made I shall say no more about them

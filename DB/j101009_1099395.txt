of the prisoner to appear unmanacled at his trialNOTES OF CASES IN Riley v Sherwood Mo 45 S W 1077 a case involving the testamentary capacity of a testatrix who was a native of Virginia but resided in Missouri the contestant introduced evidence of a passionate fondness of the decedent for dwelling upon the memories of olden times back in old Virginia and urged this as evidence of her insanity Gannt P J who probably has some of the blue blood of the Old Dominion in his own veins delivered the opinion of the court and thus disposes of this evidence of insanity Again it was considered evidence of insanity that Mrs Shootman in her old age delighted to recall the recollections of her childhood and young womanhood in Salem Virginia It was said the constant repetition of those events in her life was evidence of an unsound mind To one who never lived in the Old Dominion prior to the late war between the States the fondness with which all Virginians dwell upon those halcyon days sweetened with an unrivaled hospitality this tend ency to recall again and again the memories of that period may seem unnatural but to those who knew Virginia at that time even as casual sojourners instead of being evidence of weakness it would excite suspicion should a Virginian neglect for any considerable time to recrunt the glories and delights of that period In deed it can be said that such was the spell of that life that all who came within its influence became intoxicated with its charms and ever afterwards dwelt with loving reiteration upon its refinement We are unwilling to believe that any con siderable number of the most advanced neurologists would see in this amiable dis position to linger over the memories of youth and home the most remote evidence of unsoundness of mind Certain it is that the courts of this land reject it as evi dence of incapacity to make a will DISQUALIFICATION OF JUDGE FOR INTERESTMUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS In AMeyer v City of Diego Cal 53 Pac 434 it is held that a judge who is an inhabitant and a taxpayer of a city is disqualified by reason of his interest in the result to try any case in which the pecuniary interest of the city is involved di ectly and materially affecting the judge as a taxpayer The opinion is a learned one and contains a full review of the authorities The interest says Henshaw J  which one has in a public question merely because he is a member of the civic body to be affected by the question is not the interest which the law has in mind In the case from which we have just quoted the judge in probate was not held to be disqualified because in a will before him there was a bequest of money to trustees to be devoted to the use and benefit of indigent persons in certain towns of one of which the judge was an inhabitant So in Foreman v Town of Mariana infra the judge who was an inhabitant of the town was not for that reason held to be disqualified to sit in and determine upon proceedings for the annexation of territory to the townalthough an election had been called to pass upon the question of annexation and the judge had voted thereat And so in Sauls v Freeman 24 Fla 209 4 South 525 the fact that the circuit judge with other registered voters of the county had signed a petition addressed to the county commissioners asking for a change of the county site did not dis qualify him for interest for sitting in a mandamus proceeding to compel the com missioners to call an election upon the question In these and like cases the so 1898 261VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER called interest of the judge is found to be remote doubtful and speculative in no way certain in fact nor susceptible of precise measurement  But upon the other hand where in any litigation there is any certain defina ble pecuniary or proprietary interest or relation which will be directly affected by the judgment that may be rendered in every such case without exception so far as an exhaustive examination of the authorities goes the disqualification of the judge is held to exist Has the judge any pecuniary or personal right or privilege directly affected by or immediately dependent upon the result of the case As that question is answered so is answered the question of his disqualification for the interest which we have been considering Hesketh v Braddock 3 Burrows 1856 State v Stuart 23 Me 112 State v Wood ward 34 Me 293 Cor v Ryan 5 Mass 90 Pearce v Atwood 13 Mass 324 Tiustees v Bailey 10 Fla 213 Moses v Julian 45 N H 52 Inhabitants of North Hampton v Smith 11 Metc Mass 390 Foreman v Town of Mariana 43 Ark 324 Peck v

Fleet J dissented See 1 Dillon Munic Corp 4th ed 431 THE liability of a county to its employee injured by a defective machine in an insane asylum is denied in Hughes v Monroe County N Y 39 L R A 33 where the asylum is maintained by the county as a political division of the State although some revenue is incidentally derived from the sale of surplus farming products and from payments by those liable for the support of insane persons kept therein Although a county is declared to be a municipal corporation by statute it is held in Markey v Queens County N Y 39 L R A 46 that such statute does not create any new liability for torts or make the county liable for negligence in maintaining a bridge A long line of Indiana cases is overruled by Jasper County Comrs v Allman 142 Ind 572 39 L R A 58 which denies the liability of a county for negli gence of its officers in respect to keeping a bridge in repair A county which expressly authorizes or ratifies the tortious acts of its officers who assume to act under an unconstitutional statute to the injury of riparian rights is held in Schussler v Hennepin County Comrs Minn 39 L R A 75 to be liable for the damages With the four cases above named is an extensive note compiling the great number of authorities on the liability of counties in actions for torts and negligence See Fry v Albemarle County 86 Va 195 Field v Albemarle County Va

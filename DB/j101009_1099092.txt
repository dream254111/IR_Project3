THE ASSIGNMENT BY GEORGE E SIPE RECEIVER ETC TO H C PANKEY AND D T CLICK OF THE POLICY ASSENTED TO AS SET OUT IN THE NOTICE SO THAT THE ONLY QUESTIONS REMAINING TO BE DETERMINED AT THE TRIAL WERE WHETHER PLAINTIFFS HAD AN INSURABLE INTEREST IN THE PROPERTY OR WHETHER THE CLAUSE IN THE POLICY WHICH PROVIDED THAT IF THE ICE FACTORY CEASED TO BE OPERATED FOR MORE THAN TEN CONSECUTIVE DAYS THEN THE POLICY SHOULD BE VOID HAD BEEN WAIVED THE EXCEPTIONS BY THE DEFENDANT COMPANY TO THE RULINGS OF THE TRIAL COURT ARE EMBODIED IN THREE BILLS OF EXCEPTION DULY CERTIFIED BY THE COURT AND WE WILL CONSIDER THEM IN THEIR ORDER 1 THIS IS AN EXCEPTION TO THE OVERRULING OF THE DEMURRER AND THE MOTION TO DISMISS THE NOTICE IN THIS PROCEEDING TAKES THE PLACE OF BOTH THE WRIT AND THE DECLARATION AND THE DEMURRER THEREFORE ONLY RAISED THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS MATTER IN THE NOTICE SUFFICIENT TO MAINTAIN THE ACTION HENDERSON V STRINGER 6 GRATT 133 WE ARE OF OPINION THAT THE NOTICE DOES SET OUT SUFFICIENT MATTER TO MAIN TAIN THE ACTION AND THAT THERE WAS NO ERROR IN OVERRULING THE DEMURRER AS TO THE MOTION TO DISMISS THE MOTION WAS MADE ON THE GROUND THAT A PROCEEDING BY NOTICE UNDER SECTION 3211 OF THE CODE DOES NOT APPLY TO INSURANCE POLICIES THIS SECTION PROVIDES THAT ANY PERSON ENTITLED TO RECOVER MONEY BY ACTION ON ANY CONTRACT MAY ON MOTION BEFORE ANY COURT WHICH WOULD HAVE JURISDICTION IN AN ACTION OTHERWISE THAN UNDER SECTION 3215 OBTAIN JUDGMENT AFTER FIFTEEN DAYS NOTICE AND THE CONTENTION HERE IS THAT THIS PROCEEDING COMES UNDER THE EXCEP TION IN THIS STATUTE THAT IS THAT THE COURT DID NOT HAVE JURISDICTION OTHERWISE THAN UNDER SECTION 3215 BUT IT SEEMS CLEAR TO US THAT THE CIRCUIT COURT OF ROCKINGHAM HAD JURISDICTION OF THE ACTION UNDER SEC TION 3214 WHICH PROVIDES THAT  ANY ACTION AT LAW OR SUIT IN EQUITY EXCEPT WHERE IT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED MAY BE BROUGHT IN ANY COUNTY OR CORPORATION    IF IT BE TO RECOVER A LOSS UNDER A POLICY OF 1895 133VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER INSURANCE EITHER UPON PROPERTY OR LIFE WHEREIN THE PROPERTY INSURED WAS SITUATED OR THE PERSON WHOSE LIFE WAS INSURED RESIDED AT THE DATE OF THE POLICY IT IS FURTHER CONTENDED HOWEVER THAT THIS ACTION COMES UNDER THE EXCEPTION MENTIONED IN SECTION 3214 THAT IS THAT IT IS  OTHER WISE SPECIALLY PROVIDED BY SECTION 3251 OF THE CODE THIS CONTEN TION IS ALSO UNTENABLE BECAUSE SECTION 3251 ONLY PROVIDES THAT WHERE AN ACTION IS BROUGHT ON A POLICY OF INSURANCE THAT THE PLAINTIFF NEED NOT SET FORTH IN THE DECLARATION ALL OF THE CONDITIONS AND PROVISOS CONTAINED IN THE POLICY NOR ALLEGE OBSERVANCE THEREOF OR COMPLIANCE THEREWITH IN PARTICULARS ETC AND DOES NOT GIVE JURISDICTION TO THE COURTS IN SUCH ACTIONS BUT ONLY DEFINES WHAT IS NECESSARY TO BE SET FORTH AND WHAT NOT NECESSARY TO BE SET FORTH IN THE DECLARATION IN AN ACTION ON A POLICY OF INSURANCE BUT UPON ANOTHER GROUND THE MOTION TO DISMISS WAS PROPERLY OVERRULED AS WE HAVE SEEN JUDGMENT BY DEFAULT HAD BEEN RENDERED BY THE COURT AND WHEN SET ASIDE THE DEFENDANT APPEARED AND PLEADED TO THE MOTION AND IT WAS THEREFORE TOO LATE FOR IT AFTERWARDS TO SAY THAT IT HAD NOT BEEN REGULARLY BROUGHT INTO COURT HARVEY V SKIPWITH 16 GRATT 414 ALSO SECTION 3260 OF THE CODE 2 THIS IS AN EXCEPTION TO THE RULING OF THE CIRCUIT COURT IN REFUSING TO GIVE SIX INSTRUCTIONS TO THE JURY AS ASKED FOR BY THE DEFENDANT COM PANY AND IN GIVING IN LIEU THEREOF THE SIX INSTRUCTIONS WITH THE THIRD FOURTH AND FIFTH MODIFIED IT IS UNNECESSARY TO COMMENT ON THE MERITS OR DEMERITS OF THE SIX INSTRUCTIONS ASKED FOR BY THE DEFENDANT FOR THE REASON THAT THE INSTRUCTIONS AS GIVEN BY THE COURT CLEARLY AND FAIRLY LAY DOWN THE LAW APPLICABLE TO THE CASE INSTRUCTIONS THREE AND FOUR AS ASKED FOR INSTRUCTED THE JURY THAT IF THE SUBJECT COVERED BY THE POLICY SUED ON WAS A MANUFACTURING ESTABLISHMENT AND CEASED TO BE OPERATIVE OR BECAME VACANT OR UNOCCUPIED FOR TEN CONSECUTIVE DAYS PRIOR TO THE FIRE AND WAS SO VACANT AND UNOCCUPIED AT THE TIME OF THE FIRE THEN THE POLICY BECAME AND WAS VOID AND THAT THEY MUST FIND FOR THE DE FENDANT WHILE THE MODIFICATION AS MADE BY THE COURT WAS UNLESS THEY FURTHER BELIEVE FROM THE EVIDENCE THAT THE CHARACTER AND USE OF THE PROPERTY WAS KNOWN TO THE INSURER AND THAT IN VIEW OF THE KNOWN USE AND CHARACTER OF THE MANUFACTURING BUSINESS CONDUCTED ON THE PRERMISES AS AN ICE MANUFACTORY CONTINUOUS OPERATION OR CONTINUOUS PER SONAL OCCUPANCY WAS NOT PRACTICABLE NOR CONTEMPLATED BY THE INSURED AND INSURER DURING A PORTION OF THE TIME COVERED BY THE POLICY THE FIFTH INSTRUCTION AS ASKED FOR INSTRUCTED THE JURY THAT IF THEY BELIEVED FROM THE EVIDENCE THAT THE INTEREST OF THE ASSURED IN THE PROPERTY IN SURED WAS ANY OTHER THAN UNCONDITIHJNAL AND SOLE OWNERSHIP THEY SHOULD 134 JUNEMOROTOCK INS CO V PANKEY FIND FOR THE DEFENDANT TO WHICH THE COURT ADDED  BUT IF THEY FURTHER BELIEVE FROM THE EVIDENCE THAT AT THE TIME OF THE ISSUANCE OF THE POLICY IN SUIT THAT GEORGE E SIPE GENERAL RECEIVER FOR THE CIRCUIT COURT OF ROCKINGHAM COUNTY AS THE OWNER OF THE DEBT OF 3000 SECURED BY A DEED OF TRUST UPON THE INSURED PREMISES HAD AN INSURABLE INTEREST IN THE PROPERTY AND THAT AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSFER OF SAID POLICY TO THE PLAINTIFFS IN THIS SUIT THEY HAD BECOME THE PURCHASERS AT A JUDICIAL SALE OF THE INSURED PREMISES WHICH SALE WAS AFTERWARDS CONFIRMED BY SAID COURT AND THAT THE INSURED HAD KNOWLEDGE OF THE CHARACTER OF THE PLAINTIFFS TITLE AT THE TIME OF SAID TRANSFER THE JURY ARE FURTHER IN STRUCTED THAT THE PLAINTIFFS ARE NOT DEBARRED BY THE PROVISION OF THE CONTRACT AFORESAID  THE MODIFICATIONS INSERTED BY THE COURT IN THE IN STRUCTIONS PERMITTED THE JURY TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION ALL OF THE DEAL INGS OF THE PARTIES THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INSURER OF THE CHARACTER OF THE PROPERTY AND ITS USE BOTH AT THE TIME OF THE ISSUANCE OF THE POLICY AND AFTER AND ESPECIALLY AT THE TIME WHEN THE POLICY WAS ASSIGNED TO PANKEY  CLICK AND THEN TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE INSURER BE CAME ESTOPPED FROM SETTING UP THE BREACH OF THE CONDITION RELIED ON AS A DEFENSE THIS WAS EMINENTLY PROPER AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE VERY RIGHT OT THE CASE THE DECISIONS OF THE COURTS OF OTHER STATES UPON THE QUESTION OF WAIVER OF THE CONDITIONS OF AN INSURANCE POLICY ARE TOO NUMEROUS FOR CITA TION IF NOT IRRECONCILABLE BUT IT IS LAID DOWN AS THE LAW OF THIS STATE IN THE ABLE OPINION OF JUDGE BURKS SPEAKING FOR THE COURT IN GEORGIA HOME INSURANCE CO V KINNIERS ADMX 28 GRATT 88 AND NEVER SINCE QUES TIONED BY THIS COURT THAT A CONDITION IN A POLICY OF FIRE INSURANCE THAT IF THE RISK BE INCREASED BY A CHANGE OF OCCUPANCY OR OTHER MEANS WITHIN THE CONTROL OF THE ASSURED WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE INSURERS THE POLICY SHALL BE VOID BEING INSERTED FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE IN SURERS THEY MAY DISPENSE WITH A COMPLIANCE THEREWITH OR WAIVE A FOR FEITURE OF THE POLICY INCURRED BY A BREACH THEREOF AND THEREBY BECOME ESTOPPED FROM SETTING UP SUCH CONDITION AS A BREACH IN AN ACTION FOR A LOSS SUBSEQUENTLY OCCURRING AND SUCH WAIVER NEED NOT BE IN WRITING BUT MAY BE BY PAROL ANY ACTS DECLARATIONS OR COURSE OF DEALING BY THE INSURERS WITH KNOWLEDGE OF THE FACTS CONSTITUTING A BREACH OF A CONDITION IN THE POLICY RECOGNIZING AND TREATING THE POLICY AS STILL IN FORCE AND LEADING THE ASSURED TO REGARD HIMSELF AS STILL PROTECTED THEREBY WILL AMOUNT TO A WAIVER OF THE FORFEITURE BY REASON OF SUCH BREACH AND ESTOP THE COMPANY FROM SETTING UP THE SAME AS A DEFENSE 135 1895VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER WHEN SUED FOR A SUBSEQUENT LOSS  AND FURTHER THAT SUCH WAIVER NEED NOT BE FOUNDED ON ANY NEW CONSIDERATION THE EVIDENCE IN THE CASE AT BAR CLEARLY SHOWEDIN FACT IT IS NOT CON TROVERTEDTHAT DECHERT THE LOCAL AGENT OF THE PLAINTIFF IN ERROR AT HARRISONBURG CLOTHED WITH THE USUAL AUTHORITY CONFERRED UPON AGENTS OF AN INSURANCE COMPANY AND WHO ISSUED THE POLICY OF INSURANCE TO GEORGE E SIPE RECEIVER KNEW WHAT THE INTEREST OF THE ASSURED WAS IN THE PROPERTY COVERED BY THE POLICY THAT HE WAS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE PROPERTY THAT HE WAS ON THE PREMISES A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE POLICY WAS ISSUED THAT THE ICE FACTORY WAS ON THE DAY HE WAS THERE NOT IN OPERATION THAT IT WAS NOT SUSCEPTIBLE OF OCCUPANCY AS A DWELLING THAT IT WAS NEVER OPERATED IN THE WINTER AND THAT IT WAS NOT IN OPERATION WHEN THE ASSIGNMENT OF THE POLICY WAS MADE FROM SIPE RECEIVER TO PANKEY  CLICK DECHERT HIMSELF WHO WAS INTRODUCED AS A WITNESS FOR THE ASSURED TESTIFIED TO THE ABOVE FACTS AND FURTHER THAT THE ICE FACTORY WAS IN OPERATION ABOUT A MONTH AFTER THE POLICY WAS WRITTEN HE THOUGHT BUT NOT AFTER THAT THAT HE USED THE POLICIES OF THE PLAINTIFF IN ERROR MAINLY ON SPECIAL HAZARDS AND WHERE GOOD COMPANIES DECLINED TO WRITE THAT HE DID NOT MAKE ANY INDORSEMENT OF WAIVER AS TO CEASING TO OPER ATE ON THE POLICY THAT NOTHING WAS SAID ABOUT SUCH AN INDORSEMENT AND HE DID NOT THINK IT NECESSARY FROM THE NATURE OF THE BUSINESS OF AN ICE FACTORY AND THAT HE KNEW THEY WERE NOT OPERATED IN TOWNS DURING THE WINTER MONTHS THAT HE WAS AT THE SALE WHEN PANKEY  CLICK PURCHASED THE PROPERTY AND WHEN TOLD BY PANKEY THAT HE WANTED IT INSURED HE DECHERT THEN GOT THE TWO POLICIES WHICH HAD FORMERLY BEEN ISSUED TO SIPE AND TRANSFERRED THEM TO THE PURCHASERS ON THE DAY OF SALE THE EVIDENCE FURTHER SHOWS THAT DECHERT THE AGENT WAS ASKED BY PANKEY AT THE TIME WHETHER THE POLICIES HE HAD ASSIGNED TO PANKEY  CLICK WERE AS GOOD AS NEW ONES AND THAT HE REPLIED THAT THEY WERE AS GOOD AS NEW POLICIES AND THE MONEY WOULD BE PAID JUST AS SOON IF THERE WAS A FIRE AND THAT ON THE SAME DAY DECHERT ISSUED ANOTHER POLICY ON THIS SAME PROPERTY FOR AN ADDITIONAL INSURANCE OF 1000 MAKING A TOTAL INSURANCE OF 4000 ON THE PROPERTY SHOWN TO HAVE COST FROM 10000 TO 11000 ALL OF WHICH WAS PROMPTLY PAID UP EXCEPT THE AMOUNT OF THE POLICY HERE SUED ON THIS EVIDENCE WE THINK CLEARLY SHOWS THAT THE PLAINTIFF IN ERROR WAS LIABLE TO PANKEY  CLICK DEFENDANTS IN ERROR ON THE POLICY SUED ON AND THERE BEING NO QUESTION THAT THERE WAS A TOTAL LOSS BY THE FIRE OF MARCH 7 1893 THE INSURER WAS LIABLE FOR THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE POLICY 136 JUNEWILSON V CARPENTERS ADMR 1250 AND THE

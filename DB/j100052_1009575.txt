J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1009575,THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CENSUS,I242523,THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CENSUS THE CENSUS OF THE UNITED STATES FURNISHES A STRIKING INSTANCE OF THE GROWTH OF ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS ORIGI NALLY INTENDED AS A SIMPLE DEVICE FOR THE DETERMINATION OF APPORTIONMENT THE CENSUS HAS COME TO BE LOOKED UPON AS A GREAT NATIONAL BALANCESHEET ON WHICH FROM DECADE TO DE CADE THE RESULTS OF NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ARE TO BE RECORDED AND SUMMARIZED IN EXCEEDING THE LIMITS SET FOR IT BY THE LETTER OF THE CONSTITUTION IT HAS NOT ONLY SERVED REAL AND FANCIED NEEDS OF PRACTICAL ADMINISTRATION BUT HAS BECOME A LEADING INSTRUMENT IN THE SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION OF THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OF THE NATION THE PREPARA TIONS WHICH ARE NOW BEING MADE FOR THE TWELFTH CENSUS HAVE THEREFORE MORE THAN A PRACTICAL OR POLITICAL INTEREST THE CENSUS OPERATIONS ARE EAGERLY FOLLOWED BY ALL WHO ARE SEEK ING LIGHT ON THE MANY PROBLEMS OF PUBLIC POLICYWHETHER FOR THE SOLUTION OF A SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY OR FOR THE ATTAINMENT OF A PRACTICAL END THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CENSUS FROM HUMBLE BEGINNINGS TO ITS PRESENT PROPORTIONS PORTRAYS THE GROWTH IN NUMBER AND COMPLEXITY OF THESE PROBLEMS OF NATIONAL CONCERN A COMPARISON OF THE FIRST CENSUS OF I790 WITH THAT OF I890 SHOWS A TRULY REMARKABLE GROWTH WHICH CAN BE ROUGHLY MEASURED BY THE AMOUNT OF EXPENDITURE OR BY THE AMOUNT OF PRINTING INVOLVED WHILE THE FIRST CENSUS COST THE GOVERN MENT 4437728 THE LAST OR ELEVENTH CENSUS HAS COST UPWARDS OF I IOOO OOO THIS INCREASE IN EXPENDITURE HAS BEEN DUE IN PART TO THE GROWTH OF POPULATION BUT IN STILL LARGER DEGREE TO THE EXTENSION OF THE SCOPE OF STATISTICAL INQUIRIES AND THE GREATER ELABORATION OF THEIR RESULTS IF THE SAME PER CAPITA COST OF ENUMERATION HAD PREVAILED IN 1890 AS ONE HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE THE COST OF THE CENSUS 358THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CENSUS WOULD HAVE FALLEN SHORT OF IOOOOOO NOT ONLY HAS THE ENUMERATION OF THE POPULATION ITSELF BECOME INFINITELY MORE DETAILED BUT A LARGE NUMBER OF INQUIRIES HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THOSE RELATING TO THE POPULATION THE CENSUS REPORT OF 1790 RELATING TO POPULATION ONLY IS A THIN OCTAVO PAMPHLET OF FIFTYSIX PAGES WHILE THE REPORT ON POPULATION OF THE ELEVENTH CENSUS IS COMPRISED IN TWO QUARTO VOLUMES AGGREGATING 2I8I PAGES THE ENTIRE CENSUS OF I890 IS TO COMPRISE TWENTYFIVE QUARTO VOLUMES WITH UPWARDS OF TWENTYTWO THOUSAND PAGES OF PRINTED MATTER EXCLUSIVE OF THE COMPENDIUM THREE VOLUMES THE ABSTRACT AND THE ATLAS IN CONSIDERING THE STEPS BY WHICH THE CENSUS HAS GROWN TO SUCH PROPORTIONS OUR INQUIRY WILL BE FACILITATED BY CON SIDERING IN THE FIRST INSTANCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INQUIRIES RELATING TO POPULATION AND RESERVING FOR SUBSEQUENT CONSID ERATION THE ADDITION OF FURTHER INQUIRIES AN OBVIOUS REASON FOR SUCH A DIVISION OF THE SUBJECT AND ITS TREATMENT BY TOPICS LIES IN THE FACT THAT POPULATION IS THE ONLY SUBJECT COMPRISED IN THE ENUMERATIONS FROM START TO FINISH THE HISTORY OF THE ENUMERATION OF THE PEOPLE MAY BE CON VENIENTLY CONSIDERED IN THREE DISTINCT PERIODS THE FIRST WHICH IS ONE OF WHOLLY PRIMITIVE METHODS CLOSES WITH THE CENSUS OF I840 THE SECOND WHICH IS MARKED BY AN IMPROVEMENT OF THE SCHEDULES BUT AN ADHERENCE TO ANTI QUATED AND INEFFECTIVE ORGANIZATION BEGINS WITH I850 AND ENDS WITH I870 THE THIRD PERIOD BEGINS WITH I880 AND INCLUDES OUR EXPERIENCE DOWN TO THE PRESENT TIME FIRST PERIOD 179OZ84O PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF THE CONSTITUTION THERE HAD BEEN NO GENERAL NUMBERING OF THE PEOPLE IN THE COLONIES FROM TIME TO TIME THE BOARD OF TRADE AND PLANTATIONS DEMANDED REPORTS FROM THE VARIOUS GOVERNORS AS TO THE NUMBER OF INHABITANTS IN THEIR COLONIES STATEMENTS PREPARED IN RESPONSE TO SUCH ORDERS CONSTITUTE OUR CHIEF MATERIAL FOR A 359 3536 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY KNOWLEDGE OF POPULATION IN THE COLONIAL PERIOD THE FIG URES GIVEN REST CHIEFLY ON CONJECTURE AND ESTIMATE AND DO NOT CONSTITUTE AN ENUMERATION IN THE MODERN SENSE THE CENSUS OF I790 TAKEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CON STITUTIONAL PROVISION DIRECTING AN ENUMERATION OF THE PEO PLE TO BE MADE WAS NOT ONLY THE FIRST WHICH COVERED THE TERRITORY OF THE UNITED STATES AS A WHOLE BUT IT WAS ALSO THE FIRST DIRECT ENUMERATION MADE ANYWHERE IT NEEDS NO EXPLANATION TO SHOW THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION WAS DICTATED BY NO ENLIGHTENED INSIGHT INTO THE VALUE OF STATIS TICAL RESEARCH BUT BY THE PRACTICAL NEED OF ASCERTAINING THE NUMBERS OF THE PEOPLE FOR THE PURPOSE OF APPORTIONMENT THE CONSTITUTIONAL RULE WHICH PLACED THE REPRESENTATION OF SLAVES AND FREE PERSONS ON A DIFFERENT BASIS INVOLVED HOW EVER A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THESE TWO CLASSES IN THE ENUMER ATION THE LETTER OF THE CONSTITUTION WOULD HAVE BEEN FULLY SATISFIED HAD NO FURTHER DISTINCTIONS BEEN MADE YET THE FIRST CENSUS LAW SHOWS THAT THE IDEA OF UTILIZING THE CENSUS FOR OTHER ENDS THAN THE MERE REGULATION OF APPORTIONMENT HAD ITS ORIGIN AT THE OUTSET OF OUR HISTORY SOME FEATURES OF THE LAW TAT LEAST THOSE RELATIVE TO THE MACHINERY OF CENSUSTAKINGREMAINED IN OPERATION FOR A LONG TIME THE ACT PROVIDES THAT THE ENUMERATION OF THE PEOPLE SHALL BE MADE UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE UNITED STATES MARSHALS WHO MIGHT APPOINT AS MANY ASSISTANTS AS MIGHT BE NECESSARY TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK THE ASSISTANTS WERE REQUIRED TO MAKE THE RETURNS BY A PERSONAL VISIT TO EACH DWELLINGHOUSE  ALL PERSONS OVER SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE WERE  HISTORIES OF STATISTICS FREQUENTLY ASCRIBE TO SWEDEN THE HONOR OF HAVING IN 1748 TAKEN THE FIRST CENSUS THE ACCOUNT OF THE POPULATION PREPARED AT THAT TIME WAS HOWEVER A TRANSCRIPT OF THE PERMANENT REGISTERS OF THE POPULATION WHICH EXISTED IN SWEDEN AND NOT A DIRECT ENUMERATION TACT OF MARCH R I790 I IN THE ABSENCE OF AN ADEQUATE SUPERVISION OF THE WORK OF THE ENUMERATORS IT IS TO BE FEARED THAT THIS PROVISION WAS NOT STRICTLY CARRIED OUT AS LATE AS I860 IT WAS NOT INFREQUENT THAT IN THE RURAL REGIONS THE CENSUS WAS FILLED OUT ON COURT DAYS THE STORY OF THE MAN WHO TOOK A CENSUS IN A  BOOM  REGION BY ANNOUNCING THAT HE WANTED TO BUY REAL ESTATE AND COUNTING THE CROWD WHICH GATHERED ABOUT THE HOTEL IS NOT WHOLLY IMPROBABLE 360THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CENSUS REQUIRED TO MAKE THE RETURNS AND GIVE THE INFORMATION PRE SCRIBED BY THE ACT UNDER A PENALTY OF 2000 FOR REFUSAL THE PAYMENT TO ASSISTANTS WAS IOO FOR EVERY 150 PERSONS ENUMERATED A CURIOUS PROVISION OF THE LAW WAS THAT BEFORE MAKING THEIR RETURN TO THE MARSHAL THE ASSISTANTS WERE REQUIRED TO PREPARE TWO COPIES WHICH WERE TO BE POSTED FOR THE INSPECTION OF THE PUBLIC AND IN MAKING RETURNS TO THE MARSHALS THEY WERE REQUIRED TO ADD A CERTIFICATE FROM TWO REPUTABLE CITIZENS THAT THE RETURNS HAD BEEN POSTED AS THE LAW REQUIRED WHEN THE RETURNS WERE RECEIVED BY THE MARSHALS THEY WERE TO BE TRANSMITTED BY THEM TO THE PRESI DENT FOR THEIR LABORS THE MARSHALS RECEIVED FIXED SUMS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THE LAW VARYING FROM IOO TO 5OO00 THE LAW REQUIRES RETURNS ON THE POINTS INCLUDED IN THE FOLLOWING SCHEME IN EACH FAMILY THE NUMBER OF FREE WHITES NAME OF HEAD OH OF FAMILY  C FREE SLAVESRLL S FREE SLAVES U FE PERSONS 0 0 IO 2 C I 2 3 4 5 6 7     I THE SCHEDULE CONTAINED ONE LINE FOR EACH FAMILY WHEN IT WAS COMPLETED A NEW ONE WAS COMMENCED IT IS TO BE INFERRED THAT THE LOCALITY WAS INDICATED AT THE TOP OF THE SHEET AS THERE IS NO COLUMN FOR THESE NOTICES AS IN LATER CENSUS SCHEDULES IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT THE LETTER OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN FULFILLED IF COL UMNS 2 TO 5 OF THE ABOVE SCHEME HAD BEEN UNITED IN ONE WE HAVE NO EXPRESS RECORD OF THE PURPOSE IN MAKING THESE  THIS IS NOT AN EXACT REPRODUCTION OF THE SCHEDULE USED BUT INDICATES ITS FORM AND ESSENTIAL NATURE 361 3738 ANNALS OF THI AMERICAN ACADEMY DISTINCTIONS BUT IT IS EVIDENT TO STUDENTS OF STATISTICS THAT THE DIVISION OF THE FREE WHITE MALES INTO AGE CLASSES WAS DICTATED BY CONSIDERATIONS RESPECTING POSSIBLE MILITARY STRENGTH THE CENSUS RETURNS OF I790 WERE ISSUED IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR IN AN EDITION OF I50 COPIES ALL OF THEM SIGNED BY JEF FERSON SECRETARY OF STATE A TABLE OF RETURNS BY STATES ON THE FIRST PAGE REPRESENTS THE ONLY WORK WHICH WAS DONE BY THE CENTRAL AUTHORITY TECHNICALLY EVEN THIS IS DEFECTIVE SINCE THE INDIVIDUAL COLUMNS ARE NOT ADDED BUT ONLY THE FINAL COLUMN WHICH GIVES THE TOTALS FOR EACH STATE THE REMAINDER OF THE SCANTY VOLUME IS DEVOTED TO THE RETURNS OF THE MARSHALS WHICH ARE PRINTED IN EXACTLY THE FORM IN WHICH THEY WERE MADE BY THOSE OFFICIALS WITH A SCHEDULE SUCH AS HAS BEEN DESCRIBED THERE IS LITTLE POSSIBILITY OF OTHER THAN A GEOGRAPHICAL GROUPING OF FACTS IN THE NORTHERN STATES AS A RULE TOWN OR TOWNSHIP POPULATION IS GIVEN AS WELL AS THAT OF THE COUNTIES ALTHOUGH CONNECTICUT WHICH HAD A TOWNSHIP ORGANIZATION IS RETURNED BY COUNTIES ONLY IN THE SOUTHERN STATES WHERE THE COUNTY WAS THE UNIT OF LOCAL ORGANIZATION WE FIND NO FURTHER SUBDIVISION OF THE RETURNS SIMPLE AS THE SCHEDULE WAS THE MARSHALS FOUND IT POSSIBLE TO VARY THE REPORTS THUS THE MASSACHUSETTS MARSHAL GIVES THE NAMES OF HIS ASSISTANTS INDICATING THE DISTRICTS TO WHICH THEY WERE ASSIGNED AND THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PERSONS RETURNED BY EACH ENUMERATOR IN VIRGINIA EACH ASSISTANT HAD A COUNTY AND HIS NAME APPEARS IN THE REPORT IN GENERAL THE RETURNS ARE SIMPLY A SUMMARY OF THE CATE GORIES MENTIONED IN THE SCHEDULE IT IS HOWEVER OF INTEREST TO NOTE THAT THE MASSACHUSETTS MARSHAL GOES BEYOND THE INSTRUCTIONS ADDING COLUMNS GIVING THE NUMBER OF HOUSES AND THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES WHILE IN NEW YORK THE MARSHAL HAS ANALYZED THE FIGURES BY ASCERTAINING AND REPORTING FOR EACH TOWN THE EXCESS OF MALES AND THE EXCESS OF FEMALES OF COURSE SUCH A DIVISION MUST OF NECESSITY REFER TO THE FREE WHITES ONLY AS THE OTHER ELEMENTSNUMERICALLY 362THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CENSUS INCONSIDERABLE IT IS TRUE IN NEW YORKWERE NOT DIVIDED BY SEX THE CENSUS OF I790 REMAINED THE MODEL FOR SUBSEQUENT ENUMERATIONS DOWN TO THE YEAR I840 INCLUSIVE BOTH AS RESPECTS THE FORM OF SCHEDULE AND OF PUBLICATION NOT THAT THE CENSUS REMAINED STATIONARY BUT THE FUNDAMENTAL PRIN CIPLE REMAINED UNCHANGED DURING THIS PERIOD THE SCHEDULE UNDERWENT SEVERAL EXTEN SIONS AND AT EACH CENSUS IT WAS LARGER THAN AT THE PRECEDING YET THE LINE OF VARIATION WAS A VERY SIMPLE ONE RELATING AS IT DID CHIEFLY TO THE AGE DIVISIONS OF THE POPULATION IN THE ENUMERATION A SINGLE LINE REPRESENTED A FAMILY AND IN PUB LICATION A SINGLE LINE REPRESENTED A GEOGRAPHICAL UNIT WHETHER TOWNSHIP COUNTY STATE OR NATION IN I800 I8IO AND I820 THE SCHEME OF AGE DISTRIBUTION WAS PRACTICALLY THE SAME FOR WHITES IT COMPRISED FOR MALES AND FEMALES SEPA RATELY THE FOLLOWING GROUPS UNDER O0 10 TO 15 I6 TO 25 26 TO 44 45 AND UPWARD SLAVES AND FREE COLORED WERE ENUMERATED IN THE MASS IN THE YEARS I8OO AND I8IO WHILE IN I820 A SEX AND AGE DISTRIBU TION SIMILAR TO THE FREE WHITES WAS ADOPTED THE LATTER CENSUS ALSO HAD A COLUMN DEVOTED TO ALL OTHER FREE PERSONS EXCEPT INDIANS NOT TAXED A CATEGORY WHICH IT MUST BE ASSUMED INCLUDED CIVILIZED INDIANS BUT WHICH DISAPPEARED IN SUBSEQUENT ENUMERATIONS IN THE YEARS I8OO AND I8IO AS IN 1790 THE AGGREGATE POPULATION BY THE FAMILY OR GEOGRAPHICAL UNIT WAS THE SUM OF ALL THE INDIVIDUAL COLUMNS RELATING TO IT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN I820 COLUMNS APPEARED WHICH DID NOT ENTER INTO THIS TOTAL ONE OF THESE WAS AN ANOMALOUS AGE CLASS OF SIXTEEN TO EIGHTEEN YEARS FOR MALES ONLY THE PURPOSE OF WHICH IS NOT CLEARLY DISCERNIBLE AND A CATEGORY OF FOREIGNERS NOT NATURALIZED IN THE PUBLISHED REPORT A DOUBLE RULING SEPARATES THESE COLUMNS FROM THE ADJACENT ONES AND THE HEADINGS OF THE COLUMNS WERE PRINTED IN ITALICS APART THEREFORE FROM THE QUESTION RELATING TO 363 3940 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY CITIZENSHIP THE ONLY EXTENSION OF THE TABLES UP TO I820 INCLUSIVE WAS IN THE DIRECTION OF A MORE COMPLETE AND MORE UNIFORM AGE DISTRIBUTION FOR THE DIFFERENT CLASSES IN 1830 AND 1840 THE SCHEDULE WAS CONSIDERABLY ENLARGED THE AGE DISTRIBUTION OF FREE WHITES WAS IN FIVEYEAR CLASSES UP TO NINETEEN YEARS INCLUSIVE AND IN TENYEAR CLASSES THEREAFTER WITH A FINAL CLASS OF ONE HUNDRED YEARS AND OVER FOR EACH OF THE SEXES SEPARATELY FOR SLAVES AND FREE COLORED PERSONS A MORE SUMMARY DISTRIBUTION WITH SIX CLASSES IN EACH SEX WAS MADE THE AGE CLASSES BEING AS FOLLOWS UNDER IO 10 TO 24 24 TO 36 36 TO 55 55 TO IOO IOO AND OVER THUS ONLY WAS THE UNIFORMITY OF THE DISTRIBUTION DIS TURBED BUT AN EXACT COMPARISON BETWEEN WHITES AND BLACKS WAS RENDERED IMPOSSIBLE THE LACK OF ADHERENCE TO THE DECIMAL SYSTEM IN THE LENGTH OF THE AGE PERIODS HERE AS WELL AS IN THE GROUPING FOR FREE WHITES PRIOR TO 1830 IS UNACCOUNTABLE THE SCHEDULE SHOWED AN IMPROVEMENT INASMUCH AS ADDI TIONAL INQUIRIES DID NOT AS IN 1820 APPEAR IN THE MIDST OF THE SCHEDULE BUT WERE RESERVED FOR THE FINAL COLUMNS AFTER A COLUMN HAD BEEN PROVIDED FOR THE TOTAL POPULATION THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRED IN 1830 RELATED TO PHYSICAL DEFECTS DEAF AND DUMB IN THREE AGE GROUPS THE BLIND IN THE AGGREGATE FOR WHITE AND COLORED SEPARATELY AND ALSO TO CITI ZENSHIP IN 1840 INSANITY WAS ADDED TO THE PHYSICAL DEFECTS RECORDED WHILE FOR THE FIRST TIME THE CENSUS MADE A RECORD OF OCCUPATIONS WHICH HOWEVER WERE SUMMARIZED IN SEVEN GROUPS THIS CENSUS ALSO ASKED FOR THE NUMBER OF PENSION ERS ONE COLUMN RELATED FURTHER TO ILLITERACY AND A NUMBER OF COLUMNS TO SCHOOLS THOUGH HOW THE LATTER COULD HAVE BEEN RECORDED IN THE GENERAL POPULATION SCHEDULE IS NOT APPARENT THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT SHOWS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE QUESTIONS FROM 1790 TO I840

AND IT WAS THE DUTY OF THE MARSHAL TO FILL THEM OUT THROUGH HIS ASSISTANTS ON THE COMPLETION OF THEIR LABORS A SUMMARY WAS MADE AND SENT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE IN THE MAIN THE DEPARTMENT CONTENTED ITSELF WITH THE PREPARATION OF ONE GENERAL TABLE FOR THE UNITED STATES AND THE PRINTING OF THE MARSHALS RETURNS IN PUBLICATION THE CENSUS REPORTS FOLLOWED CLOSELY THE ORIGINAL SCHEDULE AND THE SIZE OF THE PAGES INCREASED FROM ONE CENSUS TO ANOTHER WITH THE NUMBER OF COLUMNS IN THE SCHEDULE AS LATE AS I820 THE RETURNS FOR THE DIFFERENT STATES VARIED CON SIDERABLY IN THAT YEAR VERMONT MADE NO RETURN OF THE POPULATION BY TOWNS WHILE IN SEVERAL CASES RHODE ISLAND CONNECTICUT DELAWARE MARYLAND AND MASSACHUSETTS THE COUNTY TOTALS ARE NOT ADDED FROM THE TOWN RETURNS AN OMIS SION WHICH THE STATE DEPARTMENT FAILED TO RECTIFY THESE OBVIOUS IRREGULARITIES LED IN I830 TO A PUBLICATION OF THE RETURNS OF THE MARSHALS IN TWO FORMS FIRST AS MADE AND THEN AS CORRECTED THE CORRECTION APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN TO SECURE UNIFORMITY IN THE PRESENTATION THE COUNTY TOTALS OMITTED BY THE MARSHALS MASSACHUSETTS MARYLAND INDIANA AND MICHIGAN BEING SUPPLIED IN I840 THE NEED OF A AN ANOMALOUS AGE COLUMN TA COLUMN  ALL OTHER FREE PERSONS 36542 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY PROPER EDITING SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN BETTER UNDERSTOOD AS THERE IS A SINGLE PUBLICATION OF THE RETURNS AS REPORTED AND CORRECTED IN THIS PERIOD THERE COULD BE NO TABULATION OF STATISTICS IN THE MODERN SENSE OF THE WORD IT WAS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO DO MORE THAN REPRODUCE THE SCHEDULE SINCE THE FACTS WERE NOT SO RECORDED AS TO BE SUSCEPTIBLE OF COMBINATION THUS IN THE I840 SCHEDULE NO RELATION COULD BE ASCERTAINED BETWEEN OCCUPATIONS ON THE ONE HAND AND SEX RACE AND AGE ON THE OTHER IN THE PUBLISHED RESULTS THE SIMPLEST GROUP ING WAS NOT MADE THE PRINCIPLE BEING PURSUED THAT EACH LINE ON THE SCHEDULE OR IN THE PUBLISHED TABLE MUST COUNT UP TO THE TOTAL AT THE END HENCE SUCH INTERMEDIATE SUMS AS THE TOTAL WHITE TOTAL FREE COLORED TOTAL SLAVES TOTAL MALES AND TOTAL FEMALES WERE NOT GIVEN IN THE TABLES AND IF NEEDED MUST BE LABORIOUSLY CALCULATED THE DEVELOPMENT DURING THIS PERIOD WAS SIMPLY IN THE DIRECTION OF GREATER DETAIL BUT THE CENSUS WAS STILL VERY CRUDE AS COMPARED WITH OUR MODEM ENUMERATIONS NOR HAD THE MACHINERY OF TAKING THE CENSUS DURING THIS PERIOD UNDERGONE ANY ESSENTIAL CHANGE THE FIRST CENSUS ENUMER ATORS WERE ALLOWED BY THE LAW NINE MONTHS FOR THE COMPLE TION OF THEIR LABORS AND THIS PRACTICALLY REMAINED THE RULE UNTIL THE YEAR 1850 IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS INCREASED SIZE OF THE SCHEDULE WHICH WAS AGGRAVATED BY THE INEFFECTIVENESS OF THE ENUMER ATION MACHINERY THE CENSUS RESULTS WERE LOOKED UPON WITH GREAT DISTRUST THE CENSUS OF I840 IN PARTICULAR WAS THE OBJECT OF MUCH HOSTILE CRITICISM WITH THE INCREASE OF THE NUMBER OF COLUMNS THE CONTROL OF THE CORRECTNESS OF THE RESULTS BECAME INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT THE MARSHALS WERE NOT REQUIRED TO TRANSMIT THE INDIVIDUAL SCHEDULES TO WASH INGTON BUT SIMPLY THE TOTAL RESULTS FOR GEOGRAPHICAL DIVI SIONS THE LABOR OF MAKING THESE SUMMARIES WAS THEREFORE ENTRUSTED TO THE VARIOUS MARSHALS AND THEIR ASSISTANTS SCAT TERED THROUGH THE COUNTRY WITH A COMPLETE ABSENCE OF 366THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CENSUS ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROL IT WAS NATURAL THAT THE CENSUS SHOULD CONTAIN MANY ERRORS AMONG THE EVIDENCES OF DISCONTENT WITH THE CENSUS WHICH HAVE BEEN PRESERVED IS A MEMORIAL ADDRESSED IN 1843 TO CONGRESS BY THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION THROUGH A COMMITTEE CONSISTING OF EDWARD JARVIS WILLIAM BRIGHAM AND J WINGATE THORNTON THE MEMORIAL CONTENDS THAT THE CENSUS IS SO OUTRAGEOUSLY DEFECTIVE THAT IT CANNOT BE CONSID ERED A TRUE PICTURE OF THE STATE OF THE COUNTRY AND SHOULD NOT RECEIVE THE SANCTION OF CONGRESS THEY POINT OUT THAT IN MANY CASES THE REPORTS ARE OBVIOUSLY INCORRECT A SPECIAL STUDY IS MADE IN THEIR MEMORIAL OF THE SCHOOL STATISTICS OF NEW ENGLAND THE FACTS RECORDED IN THE TABLES ARE NOT ONLY INCONSISTENT WITH ONE ANOTHER BUT ARE AT VARIANCE WITH OFFICIAL DATA COLLECTED AND PUBLISHED BY THE STATE ADMINISTRA TION OF GREATER INTEREST FOR OUR PRESENT PURPOSE IS THE DISCUSSION OF THE STATISTICS OF PHYSICAL AND MENTAL DEFECTS AMONG THE COLORED POPULATION THE COMMITTEE PRINTED A LIST OF SEVENTYFIVE TOWNS IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY WHERE THE NUMBER OF THE COLORED DEAF AND DUMB REPORTED BY THE CENSUS IS AS GREAT AS OR EVEN GREATER THAN THE TOTAL COLORED POPULATION IN A STILL LARGER NUMBER OF TOWNS A LIST OF WHICH IS GIVEN THE NUMBER OF COLORED INSANE EQUALS OR EXCEEDS THE COLORED POPULATION THESE FLAGRANT INSTANCES ARE IN THE MINDS OF THE COMMITTEE SUFFICIENT TO THROW A DOUBT UPON THE VALUE OF THE WHOLE WORK FROM THOMAS EARLE AND OTHER CITIZENS OF PENNSYLVANIA A MEMORIAL WAS RECEIVED BY THE HOUSE IN WHICH ATTENTION IS CALLED TO THE SAME FACTS IN MORE GENERAL TERMS IN COMMENTING UPON THESE MEMORIALS A SELECT COMMITTEE OF THE HOUSE  MR PRATT OF NEW YORK CHAIRMAN ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE FACTS ARE AS STATED THOUGH THEY CONFESSED THEIR INABILITY TO DISCOVER WHERE THE ERROR TOOK PLACE WHETHER IN THE ORIGINAL RETURNS IN TRAN SCRIBING OR IN PUBLICATION IT SHOULD HOWEVER BE REMARKED  H R REPORTS OF COMMITTEES FIRST SESSION 28TH CONGRESS VOL III NOS 579 AND 580 367 4344 ANNAIS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY THAT THE EVIDENCE OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION IS TO THE EFFECT THAT MANY ERRORS WERE TO BE FOUND IN ALL THREE OPERATIONS AT THE SAME SESSION CONGRESS WAS OCCUPIED WITH A PROJECT OF CREATING A BUREAU OF COMMERCE AND STA TISTICS IN THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT IN THE FIRST COMMITTEE REPORT UPON THIS MEASURE ITS ADVANTAGES ARE SET FORTH BY THE CHAIRMAN MR PRATT IN VERY EXPLICIT TERMS THE BUREAU WHICH WAS CONTEMPLATED WAS TO CONCERN ITSELF WITH SUCH QUESTIONS AS WERE SUBSEQUENTLY ASSIGNED TO THE BUREAU CREATED IN 1865 NEITHER IN THE FIRST FAVORABLE REPORT OF MARCH 8 1844 ON THIS PROJECT NOR IN A SUBSEQUENT ONE WHICH WAS PRESENTED FEBRUARY 27 I845 TOGETHER WITH A STRONG LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION FROM THE THEN SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY GEORGE M BIBB IS THE RELATION OF THE PRO POSED BUREAU TO THE CENSUS WORK CONSIDERED YET WHEN ON JUNE I7 I844 THE SAME SELECT COMMITTEE OF THE HOUSE COMMENTED UPON THE MEMORIALS WHICH HAVE BEEN MEN TIONED THE REPORT SAYS THAT THE DEFECTS OF THE CENSUS DIS CUSSED IN THE MEMORIALS FORM A STRONG ARGUMENT FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A BUREAU OF STATISTICS THEY MUST THERE FORE HAVE CONTEMPLATED AT THAT TIME THAT THIS BUREAU SHOULD TAKE CHARGE OF THE CENSUS WORK THOUGH THEY FORGOT THIS ARGUMENT IN FEBRUARY I845 WHEN THEY MADE THEIR SECOND REPORT NO ACTION WAS TAKEN AT THIS CONGRESS AND THE CON TEMPLATED BUREAU WAS NOT FINALLY ESTABLISHED UNTIL I865 SECOND PERIOD 1850Z870 IN PREPARING FOR THE CENSUS OF 1850 CONGRESS RECOGNIZED THE JUSTICE OF THE CURRENT CRITICISMS OF THE PREVIOUS CENSUS AND ENTERED SERIOUSLY UPON THE WORK OF REORGANIZING THE CENSUS AN ACT OF MARCH 3 I849 CREATED A CENSUS BOARD COMPOSED OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE THE POSTMASTERGENERAL AND THE ATTORNEYGENERAL AND CHARGED THIS BOARD WITH THE DUTY OF DRAFTING THE FORMS AND SCHEDULES WHICH MIGHT  H R REPORTS OF COMMITTEES FIRST SESSION 28TH CONGRESS VOL 1 NO 301 SECOND SESSION 28TH CONGRESS NO RIO 368THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CENSUS BE NECESSARY FOR THE SEVENTH CENSUS ITS EXACT FUNCTIONS WERE NEVER DISTINCTLY DEFINED AND SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATION RENDERED IT INEFFECTIVE CONGRESS HAD ON THE SAME DAY ESTABLISHED THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND TRANSFERRED THE CENSUS LABORS FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT TO THE NEWLY CREATED DEPARTMENT WHEN CONGRESS MET IN THE FALL IT APPOINTED A SPECIAL COMMITTEE UPON THE CENSUS WHICH PRO CEEDED TO PREPARE FOR THE SEVENTH CENSUS WITH LITTLE REGARD TO THE ACTIONS OF THE CENSUS BOARD SOME DOUBT WAS EXPRESSED ON THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE WHETHER SUCH A BOARD WAS COMPETENT TO PRESCRIBE SCHEDULES WITHOUT ACTION BY CONGRESS IN ANY EVENT IT IS SUFFICIENT TO SAY THAT CONGRESS TOOK THE MATTER IN ITS OWN HANDS THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE IN CONSULTATION WITH SOME OF THE BEST AUTHORITIES ON STATIS TICAL MATTERS PREPARED AN ELABORATE BILL IN THEIR MAIN FEATURES ITS RECOMMENDATIONS MET WITH THE APPROVAL OF CON GRESS THE SCOPE OF THE CENSUS WORK WAS INDEED GREATLY ENLARGED AND THE DEBATE WHICH WAS PROLONGED DEALT AT LENGTH NOT ONLY WITH THE EXPEDIENCY BUT ALSO WITH THE CON STITUTIONALITY OF ANY ENUMERATION BEYOND THAT OF THE PEOPLE AND FOR THE PURPOSE OF APPORTIONMENT IN THE END THE UTILITY OF STATISTICAL WORK OVERCAME THE CONSTITUTIONAL SCRU PLES WHICH WERE BROUGHT FORWARD BY ALEXANDER STEPHENS OF GEORGIA AND OTHER EMINENT SOUTHERN MEMBERS THE ACT OF MAY 23 I850 IS A DISTINCT ADVANCE UPON THE PREVIOUS LEGISLATION IT WAS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE FOR THE SEVENTH CENSUS AND IN THE ABSENCE OF SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATION FOR ANY FUTURE CENSUS IN FACT THE LAW GOVERNED THE CENSUS DOWN TO 1870 INCLUSIVE NO CHANGE WAS MADE IN THE ORGAN OF ENUMERATION THE MARSHALS AND THEIR ASSISTANTS FULFILLING THIS DUTY AS HERETOFORE UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A SUPERIN TENDENT OF THE CENSUS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR THE LAW PROVIDED NOT LESS THAN SIX SCHEDULES TWO OF WHICH ONE FOR FREE INHABITANTS AND ONE FOR SLAVES RELATED TO POPU LATION THE SCHEDULE PROVIDED FOR THE FREE INHABITANTS IS IN THE FORM OF A FAMILY SCHEDULE WITH A DISTINCT LINE FOR 369 4546 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY EACH MEMBER OF THE FAMILY WHO FOR THE FIRST TIME WERE RECORDED BY NAME BUT EACH SHEET WAS USED FOR AS MANY PER SONS AS POSSIBLE SEVERAL FAMILIES BEING ON THE SAME SHEET THE PRIVACY OF A FAMILY SCHEDULE WAS LACKING BUT THE PRIN CIPLE OF INDIVIDUAL ENUMERATION WAS ESTABLISHED IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT IN THE PREVIOUS CENSUS OPERATIONS THE SCHEDULE WAS FOR THE LOCALITY AND EACH LINE REPRESENTED A FAMILY THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY ONLY BEING DESIGNATED BY NAME AS THE SCHEDULE FOR 1850 PROVIDED A LINE FOR EACH PERSON THE INFORMATION REQUESTED AS TO AGE SEX ETC COULD BE RECORDED IN A SINGLE COLUMN AND THE SCHEDULE WAS THERE FORE MUCH SIMPLIFIED THE GROUPING OF THE FACTS INTO TABLES FOR PUBLICATION WAS NO LONGER LEFT TO THE MARSHALS OF THE VARIOUS DISTRICTS BUT ENTRUSTED TO THE CENSUS OFFICE THE MARSHALS HAD NO FURTHER DUTY THAN TO COLLECT THE SCHEDULES AND SEND THEM TO WASHINGTON WHERE THEY WERE TO BE TABU LATED IN A CENTRAL BUREAU THUS INSURING A GREATER GUARANTY FOR FORMAL ACCURACY AND UNITY OF EFFORT THAN HAD EXISTED BEFORE THE SCHEDULE FOR FREE INHABITANTS ASSUMED PRACTI CALLY THE FORM WITH WHICH WE ARE FAMILIAR TODAY THOUGH IT IS MORE LIMITED IN SCOPE THAN IN THE LAST CENSUS IN ADDITION TO THE NAME OF THE FREE INHABITANTS QUESTIONS ARE ASKED REGARDING AGE SEX COLOR AND PLACE OF BIRTH OF ALL OF THE INHABITANTS FURTHER COLUMNS RELATE TO PROFESSION FOR PER SONS OVER FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE AND ILLITERACY FOR PERSONS OVER TWENTY YEARS OF AGE PHYSICAL OR MENTAL DEFECTS OWNERSHIP OF REAL ESTATE MARRIAGE WITHIN THE YEAR OR SCHOOL ATTENDANCE WITHIN THE YEAR THE SCHEDULE FOR SLAVES IS SIMPLER AND INVOLVES SIMPLY AGE SEX COLOR PHYSICAL OR MENTAL DEFECTS AND SOME FEW QUESTIONS WHICH COULD NOT APPLY TO THE FREE INHABITANTS WITH THE CENSUS OF I850 THEREFORE WE FIND AN ENUMERA TION BASED ON SCHEDULES AKIN TO THOSE NOW IN USE THE SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENT OF THE CENSUS HAS INVOLVED NO CHANGE IN THE FORM OF THE SCHEDULES THE ADVANCE WHICH HAS SINCE BEEN MADE LIES RATHER IN THE INCREASE IN THE QUESTIONS 37THZ DZVILOPMNT OF THZ CENSUS ASKED AND ESPECIALLY IN THE UTILIZATION OF THESE QUES TIONS IN THE TABULATION THE CENSUS FOR I850 WHICH WAS CONDUCTED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF J B DE BOW SHOWED A MARKED ADVANCE IN THE STATISTICAL SPIRIT IN ITS PUBLICATIONS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF THE CENSUS WE HAVE AN ADEQUATE INTRODUCTION THIS GIVES IN THE FIRST PLACE AN ACCOUNT OF THE LEGISLATION UNDER WHICH THE CENSUS WAS CON DUCTED THE INSTRUCTIONS ISSUED TO THE ENUMERATORS AND SOME OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE DETAILS WITH REGARD TO THE MODE OF CLASSIFICATION ETC IT IS MUCH TO BE REGRETTED THAT THE GOOD EXAMPLE SET BY MR DE BOW HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN FOLLOWED THE STUDENT OF STATISTICS NEEDS IN MANY CASES THE OFFICIAL INTERPRETATION OF WORDS AND PHRASES WHICH CAN ONLY BE FOUND IN THESE ADMINISTRATIVE DOCUMENTS AFTER A DESCRIPTION OF THE CENSUS MACHINERY THE SUPERINTENDENT PROCEEDS TO AN ANALYSIS OF THE CENSUS RESULTS THE ANALYSIS TREATS OF POP ULATION BY TOPICS AND CONTAINS COMPARISONS WITH THE PRECED ING CENSUS ENUMERATIONS AND IN MANY CASES ALSO WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE GENERAL TABLES IN THE BODY OF THE WORK IS LESS COMMENDABLE IT IS PURELY GEO GRAPHICAL ALL OF THE STATISTICS OF MAINE NO MATTER TO WHAT SUBJECTS THEY RELATE BEING GIVEN FIRST AND THE OTHER STATES IN ORDER IF FOR INSTANCE WE DESIRE TO FIND THE ILLITERATES BY STATES WE CAN REFER TO THE INTRODUCTION BUT IF WE SEEK A TABLE FOR ILLITERACY THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES BY COUNTIES WE MUST TURN TO TABLE IX IN EACH ONE OF THE STATES THIS HOLDS TRUE OF COURSE OF ANY OTHER ITEM OF INFORMATION THE CENSUS OF 1860 FOLLOWED THE SAME METHODS AS THAT OF I850 BEING TAKEN UNDER THE SAME LAW AND WITH THE SAME SCHEDULE IT CAME AT A CRITICAL PERIOD OF OUR HISTORY AND DID NOT RECEIVE MUCH GENERAL CONSIDERATION BEFORE THE CENSUS OF 1870 WAS UNDERTAKEN A CAREFUL CON SIDERATION OF THE NEEDS OF THE CENSUS TOOK PLACE IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES A COMMITTEE PRESIDED OVER BY GENERAL GARFIELD PRESENTED JANUARY I8 I870 AN ELABORATE REPORT UPON THE CENSUS WITH SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPORTANT AND RADICAL 37I 4748 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY CHANGES IN THE CENSUS METHODS THE COMMITTEE PREPARED A VALUABLE HISTORY OF CENSUS METHODS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND IN THE UNITED STATES AND ITS REPORT HAS BEEN THE CHIEF SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN CURIOUS TO STUDY THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR STATISTICAL EFFORTS TOGETHER WITH THEIR OWN REPORT THEY PUBLISHED SOME ACCOUNT OF THE INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL CONGRESS WHICH HAD THEN RECENTLY DEVOTED MUCH CONSIDERATION TO THE SUBJECT OF POPULATION STATISTICS AND A VALUABLE PAPER BY DR JARVIS OF BOSTON ON THE NEEDS OF THE CENSUS WORK IN THE FIELD OF POPULATION STATISTICS THE COMMITTEE DID NOT FEEL JUSTIFIED IN RECOMMENDING ANY SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE AS TO THE PERIOD OF ENUMERATIONS THE PROPOSITION FOR A ONE DAY CENSUS WHICH HAD BEEN MADE BY DR JARVIS WAS REJECTED BY THEM ON ACCOUNT OF THE EXTREME DIFFICULTY WHICH THAT METHOD INVOLVES THE DISTINCTIVE ARGUMENT FOR THE UNITED STATES IS THE FACT THAT OUR CENSUS SCHEDULES OWING TO THE CENSUS BEING THE ONLY INSTRUMENT OF GENERAL STATISTICS  WERE MORE ELABORATE THAN THOSE OF COUNTRIES HAVING PERMANENT STATISTI CAL BUREAUS THE COMMITTEE HOWEVER ARE AGREED THAT THE TIME ALLOTTED TO THE ENUMERATION WAS TOO LONG AND THAT A PERIOD OF ONE MONTH SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT THE DELAY IN PUBLICATION OF THE CENSUS WHICH HAD GIVEN RISE TO VEXATIOUS COMPLAINTS AND WHICH AS WE KNOW HAS NOT YET BEEN ABOL ISHED IS ASCRIBED BY THEM IN PART TO THE LENGTH OF TIME ALLOTTED FOR ENUMERATION PURPOSES IN THE LIGHT OF THE EXPERIENCE OF I880 AND I890 HOWEVER THIS HAS PROVED TO BE A MINOR ELEMENT IN THE DELAY THE COMMITTEE URGED HOWEVER CERTAIN IMPROVEMENTS IN THE SCHEDULE AND ADDED TO THE QUESTIONS ALREADY ASKED THOSE RELATING TO RELATIONSHIP TO HEAD OF THE FAMILY TO CONJUGAL CONDITION TO PARENTAGE AND TO DWELLINGS THE MOST RADICAL CHANGE WHICH WAS PROPOSED WAS IN THE MACHINERY OF THE CENSUS TAKING THE ENUMERATION OUT OF THE HANDS OF THE UNITED STATES MARSHALS AND PLACING IT UNDER SPECIAL AGENTS THE OLD RULE HAD WORKED INEFFECTIVELY NOT 372THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CENSUS ONLY BECAUSE THE MARSHALS BEING JUDICIAL OFFICERS WERE ALREADY SUFFICIENTLY OCCUPIED WITH OTHER AND DIFFERENT FUNC TIONS BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THE INEQUALITY IN SIZE OF THE JUDI CIAL DISTRICTS WHICH HAD IMPOSED UPON SOME OF THE MARSHALS INEQUALITY IN THEIR JUDICIAL DISTRICT A DISTRICT OF MASSA CHUSETTS EMBRACING A MILLION AND A QUARTER INHABITANTS IS CONTRASTED IN THE REPORT WITH ONE IN FLORIDA WITH A POPU LATION OF SEVENTY THOUSAND AND ONE IN ALABAMA WITH A POPULATION OF THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND THE BILL FOR THE TAKING OF THE NINTH CENSUS PREPARED BY THIS COMMITTEE INVOLVES THE POINTS ABOVE MENTIONED TOGETHER WITH MANY OTHER DETAILS WHICH LOOKED TO A CHANGE IN THE MACHINERY OF CENSUS TAKING TO AN IMPROVEMENT OF CENSUS SCHEDULES AND AN ENLARGEMENT OF THEIR SCOPE UNFORTUNATELY THE LABOR WHICH WAS SPENT IN THE PREPARATION OF THIS BILL WAS FOR THE TIME BEING LOST WHILE IT PASSED THE HOUSE IT FAILED IN THE SENATE AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL I880 THAT ITS ESSENTIAL PROVISIONS WERE INCORPORATED IN THE LAW THE NINTH CENSUS WAS TAKEN THEREFORE UNDER THE ACT OF I850 IN DEFAULT OF ANY NEW LEGISLATION UPON THE SUBJECT THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE CENSUS GENERAL F A WALKER CHAFED UNDER THE OLD AND ANTIQUATED MACHINERY AND IN HIS INTRODUCTORY REMARKS DISCUSSED THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH HE ENCOUNTERED WITH PERFECT FREEDOM AND WITH THAT VIGOR OF LANGUAGE WHICH MARKED ALL HIS UTTERANCES ALL THAT CAREFUL TABULATION COULD SUPPLY HE GAVE HIS TABLES ARE ARRANGED BY TOPICS AND HIS TEXT COMMENTARY IS AN INVALUABLE AID TO THE COMPREHENSION OF THE FIGURES AND OF THE CHARTS WHICH FORM A DISTINCTIVE FEATURE OF THIS CENSUS PUBLICATION GENERAL WALKER IS EVEN MORE EXPLICIT THAN THE GARFIELD COMMITTEE IN HIS DISCUSSION OF CENSUS METHODS IN HIS INTRO DUCTORY REPORT HE CLAIMS TO HAVE MADE THE BEST CENSUS WHICH COULD BE MADE UNDER THE EXISTING LAW COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE CENSUS WERE FREQUENT THEY WERE GENERALLY OF A CLASS HOWEVER WHICH HAVE NOT YET DISAPPEARED COMPLAINTS THAT THE POPULATION ATTRIBUTED TO CERTAIN LOCALITIES WAS TOO SMALL 373 4950 ANNALS OF THEM AMERICAN ACADEMY THE ANIMUS OF SUCH COMPLAINTS IS PERHAPS BEST PORTRAYED IN THE WORDS OF THE INTRODUCTION WHICH REMARKS THAT THE COM PLAINTS IN THE GREAT MAJORITY OF CASES HAVE BEEN NOT SO MUCH ON ACCOUNT OF THE INADEQUATE REPRESENTATION OF THE TOWN OR CITY ITSELF AS OF THE SUPERIORITY ATTRIBUTED TO SOME IMMEDIATE RIVAL THESE CONTENTIONS ARE DISMISSED BY GENERAL WALKER AS WITHOUT FOUNDATION HE IS HOWEVER EMPHATIC IN DEAL ING WITH THE ESSENTIAL VICIOUSNESS OF A PROTRACTED ENUMER ATION  WHILE THE TIME ALLOWED FOR TAKING THE CENSUS HAD BEEN SOMEWHAT SHORTENED IT WAS NONE THE LESS UNDER THE LAW OF I870 IN ROUND NUMBERS ONE HUNDRED DAYS SUCH A PERIOD OFFERS WIDE OPPORTUNITY FOR OMISSIONS AND TO SOME EXTENT DUPLICATIONS IN THE CENSUS GENERAL WALKER IS OF THE OPINION THAT THE CENSUS MIGHT READILY BE TAKEN IN A SINGLE DAY IN THE LARGER CITIES IN A PERIOD OF THREE OR FOUR DAYS IN THE MANUFACTURING DISTRICTS OF THE COUNTRY AND A PERIOD NOT EXCEEDING ONE MONTH IN THE OUTLYING REGIONS THIS IDEAL HAS NOT YET BEEN REALIZED WHILE ACKNOWLEDG ING WITH COURTESY THE SERVICES OF THE MARSHALS WHO HAD ASSISTED HIM IN THE WORK OF THE NINTH CENSUS HE DOES NOT HESITATE TO CALL ATTENTION TO THE DEFECTS OF THE LAW IN IMPOS ING THIS SERVICE UPON THOSE OFFICIALS UNDER THE LAW THEY WERE CHARGED NOT ONLY WITH THE SUPERVISION OF THE ENUMER ATION BUT ALSO WITH THE PRELIMINARY WORK OF DETERMINING THE SUBDIVISIONS WITHIN THEIR DISTRICT MOREOVER IT WAS ALWAYS AN ANOMALOUS CONDITION THAT THE AGENTS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SHOULD FOR THIS PURPOSE BE UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR ANOTHER QUES TION WHICH HAS VEXED THE LEGISLATOR SINCE THE FIRST CENSUS WAS BEGUNNAMELY THE MODE OF COMPENSATION FOR ENUMER ATORSRECEIVES ATTENTION AT LENGTH FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT BUT ITS DISCUSSION HARDLY BELONGS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS PAPER THE SCHEDULE OF I870 WAS IMPROVED BY THE RECASTING OF THE HEADINGS AND THE INTRODUCTION OF A SUMMARY QUESTION PERMITTING A RECORD OF FOREIGN PARENTAGE 3741THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CENSUS IN THE CENSUS WORK THE GREATER EXACTNESS RESULTED FROM THE DISTINCT FORMULATION OF CERTAIN QUESTIONS NOTABLY THAT WITH REGARD TO OCCUPATIONS IN THE COMPILATION OF RESULTS GREATER CARE WAS EXERCISED THE UTILIZATION OF THE MATE RIALS WAS MORE COMPLETE THAN THE FORMER PERIODS IMPROVE MENTS ARE TO BE NOTED IN REFERENCE TO CLASSIFICATION OF AGES AND OF OCCUPATION IN SHORT IN THE INTERRELATION OF THE DIF FERENT FIGURES THIRD PERIOD 1880189O A NEW PERIOD IN OUR STATISTICAL HISTORY BEGAN WITH THE CENSUS OF I880 THE ACT OF MARCH 3 I879 PROVIDES FOR A CENSUS OF BROADER SCOPE THAN ANY WHICH HAD HERETOFORE EXISTED THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE GARFIELD COMMITTEE WERE SUBSTANTIALLY ACCEPTED IN THE FORMULATION OF THE LAW THAT WHICH CHARACTERIZES THE CENSUS OF I880 OVER AND ABOVE THOSE WHICH PRECEDED IT IS THE ENORMOUS EXTENSION WHICH WAS GIVEN TO THE SUPPLEMENTARY WORK OF THE CENSUS BEYOND THE ENUMERATION OF THE PEOPLE AS CONCERNS THE LATTER WITH WHICH WE ARE HERE OCCUPIED THE MOST IMPORTANT INNOVATION WAS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SPECIAL ORGANS FOR THE COLLECTION OF THE MATERIAL THE UNITED STATES MARSHALS WERE NO LONGER CHARGED WITH THESE DUTIES WHICH WERE ENTRUSTED TO SPECIALLY APPOINTED SUPERVISORS OF THE CENSUS THE RESULT WAS GREATER UNIFORMITY IN THE LABORS OF THE SUPERVISORS THROUGH THE GREATER EQUALITY OF THE DISTRICTS OVER WHICH THEY PRESIDED THERE WAS ANOTHER CHANGE FROM AN ADMINISTRATIVE POINT OF VIEW IN THAT CENSUS ENUMERATORS WERE DIRECTLY AMENABLE TO THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE CENSUS AND THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR WHO WAS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OPERATIONS OF THE CENSUS OFFICE THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE SCHEDULE WAS REPRESENTED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF QUESTIONS RELATING TO THE CONJUGAL CONDITION OF THE PEOPLE AND TO PARENTAGE THE PUBLISHED RESULTS OF THE CENSUS REFLECT THE MORE GENE ROUS SPIRIT IN WHICH THE APPROPRIATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR THIS WORK THE TABULAR STATEMENTS ARE SUPERIOR TO THOSE 375 5152 ANNALS OF THE AMTRTCAN ACADEMY WHICH PRECEDED THEM IN THE WEALTH OF THEIR DETAILS AND IN THE CORRELATION OF THE DIFFERENT FACTS WHICH WERE THE SUBJECT OF THE CENSUS ENUMERATION AS LATE AS I880 HOWEVER THE METHODS OF TABULATION PURSUED IN THE CENSUS OFFICE WERE OF A PRIMITIVE CHARACTER THEY AFFORDED MANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR ERRORS WHILE THEIR CLUMSINESS PREVENTED THE FULLEST UTILIZATION OF THE FACTS WHICH HAD BEEN COLLECTED BY THE ENU MERATORS THUS THE FIGURES FOR CONJUGAL CONDITION ARE NOT TABULATED AT ALL IN THE CENSUS OF I880 WHILE THOSE FOR PAR ENTAGE ARE TABULATED ONLY IN PART WHEN ONE CONSIDERS THAT THE TABLES WERE MADE UP BY THE PRIMITIVE METHOD OF READING THE SCHEDULES AND SCORING OFF THE RESULTS BY MEANS OF LINES LIKE THE SCORING OF POINTS IN A GAME IT WILL BE MARVELED THAT SO MUCH WAS ACCOMPLISHED IN THE ELABORATION OF THE TABLES PREVIOUSLY GIVEN AND IT CANNOT BE WONDERED THAT THE OFFICE FOUND ITS APPROPRIATIONS TOO LIMITED FOR A TABULATION OF THE ADDITIONAL ITEMS INVOLVED IN THE SCHEDULE WITH THE ELEVENTH CENSUS WE REACH A WORK SO RECENT THAT ITS GENERAL FEATURES ARE WELL KNOWN TO STUDENTS OF ECONOMICS THE PROMISE OF CURTAILING THE CENSUS WORK WHICH WAS MADE AT THE OUTSET HAS ONLY BEEN PARTIALLY FUL FILLED THE CENSUS OF I890 NUMBERS TWENTYFIVE LARGE VOLUMES AND EXCEEDS IN BULK THAT OF 1880 BUT THERE HAS BEEN A GREAT GAIN THROUGH THE ELIMINATION OF NONSTA TISTICAL MATERIAL WHICH CUT A PROMINENT FIGURE IN THE CEN SUS OF I880 SO FAR AS THE POPULATION IS CONCERNED THE SCHEDULES WITH WHICH WE ARE FAMILIAR WERE NOT ESSENTIALLY CHANGED THE PUBLICATION OF THE RESULTS HOWEVER IS FAR MORE AMPLE THAN ANYTHING HERETOFORE KNOWN AND IS MORE EXTENSIVE THAN THE CENSUS WORK OF ANY OTHER NATION THIS RESULT WAS MADE POSSIBLE THROUGH THE ADOPTION IN THE WORK OF TABULATION OF THE ELECTRICAL TABULATING MACHINE INVENTED BY MR HERMAN HOLLERITH THIS HAS BEEN A GREAT BOON TO STATISTICAL WORK AND PROMISES TO GIVE US IN THE FUTURE THROUGH THE MORE PERFECT AND COMPLETE ANALYSIS OF RESULTS A GREATER INSIGHT THAN WE HAVE HERETOFORE ENJOYED INTO THE 376THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CENSUS PHENOMENA OF POPULATION FOR NOT ONLY HAS THE UNITED STATES CENSUS OF I890 DEMONSTRATED THE EFFICIENCY OF THE MACHINE BUT ALSO THOSE OF EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WHERE IT HAS BEEN ADOPTED NOTABLY AUSTRIA HAVE GIVEN US A FAR MORE COMPLETE ANALYSIS OF THE PHENOMENA OF POPULATION THAN WE HAVE ENJOYED BEFORE THE GENERAL TREND OF CENSUS DEVELOPMENT WHICH HAS BEEN SHOWN IN THE FOREGOING PAGES IS TOWARD AN IMPROVEMENT OF CENSUS MACHINERY AN ELABORATION OF CENSUS SCHEDULES AND A MORE CAREFUL AND MINUTE PRESENTATION OF THE RESULTS OF STA TISTICAL INQUIRY IT HAS BEEN OUR PURPOSE TO BRING THESE FACTS TO THE ATTENTION OF THE READER THROUGH A STUDY OF POPU LATION THE ORIGINAL OBJECT OF CENSUS RESEARCH WHICH STILL REMAINS THE INCENTIVE AND BACKBONE OF THE OPERATION BUT THE HISTORY OF THE CENSUS IS NOT COMPLETE WITHOUT A CONSID ERATION OF THE SUBSIDIARY INQUIRIES WHICH HAVE GROWN OUT OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT OF AN ENUMERATION OF THE POPULATION SUBSIDIARY INQUIRIES AS THE CENSUS OF I890 DEVOTES BUT TWO VOLUMES OF ITS TWENTYFIVE TO THE SUBJECT OF POPULATION IT CAN READILY BE UNDERSTOOD HOW SUBSIDIARY INQUIRIES HAVE GROWN IN IMPOR TANCE SOME OF THEM ARE A DIRECT OUTGROWTH OF THE POPULA TION SCHEDULE AND REPRESENT AS INDEPENDENT INQUIRIES AN ELABORATION OF FACTS PREVIOUSLY EMBODIED IN THE POPULATION VOLUME AND EVEN YET IN PART ENUMERATED ON THE POPULATION SCHEDULE OF THIS CLASS THERE IS THE VOLUME RELATING TO THE DEFECTIVE CLASSES THE INSANE THE DEAF AND DUMB AND THE BLIND AS EARLY AS I830 THE POPULATION SCHEDULE CALLED FOR CERTAIN INFORMATION WITH REGARD TO THESE CLASSES AND THEY HAVE BEEN THE SUBJECT OF INQUIRY AT EACH SUCCEEDING CENSUS THE PECULIAR CHARACTER OF THE SCHEDULES IN VOGUE BEFORE I850 HOWEVER MADE AN ELABORATION OF THE DATA REQUIRED OUT OF THE QUESTION THE MERE FACT OF THE EXISTENCE OF THESE INFIRMITIES WITH SUCH DIVISIONS AS TO COLOR AND AGE WHICH 377 5354 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY MIGHT BE ASKED FOR ON THE SCHEDULE WAS ALL THAT WAS AVAIL ABLE FOR PUBLICATION WITH THE SCHEDULE OF 1850 THE RETURNS ARE AS BEFORE NOTED GIVEN INDIVIDUALLY AND STATISTICS IN RELATION TO THESE CLASSES ARE THEREFORE CAPABLE OF THE SAME ELABORATION AS THOSE OF THE GENERAL POPULATION ITSELF NONE THE LESS THE RETURNS WERE VERY DEFECTIVE AND THE PUBLICATION VERY MEAGRE IT WAS NOT UNTIL 1880 THAT A MORE DIRECT STUDY OF THESE CLASSES WAS MADE IN THAT YEAR AS WELL AS IN I890 A SPECIAL SCHEDULE WAS PROVIDED FOR THESE CLASSES IT GAVE NOT ONLY THE GENERAL FACTS CALLED FOR IN THE POPULATION SCHEDULE BUT ALSO A NUMBER OF SPECIAL INQUIRIES WHICH RELATED TO THE CAUSE AND NATURE OF THE SPECIFIC INFIRMITIES IN CONSEQUENCE OF THESE CHANGES A MUCH MORE COMPLETE STUDY OF THESE UNFORTUNATE CLASSES WAS POSSIBLE THE STATIS TICS THEN IN I890 AS COMPARED WITH THOSE FOR I880 SHARE IN THE GENERAL IMPROVEMENT OF ALL POPULATION RETURNS DUE TO THE INTRODUCTION OF IMPROVED METHODS OF TABULATION SIMILAR TO THE FOREGOING ARE THE STATISTICS OF CRIME PAU PERISM AND BENEVOLENCE THEY DATE FROM THE YEAR I850 WHEN THE POPULATION SCHEDULE CONTAINED A SPACE IN WHICH MIGHT BE RECORDED THE FACT OF PAUPERISM OR CRIMINALITY AS WELL AS PHYSICAL DEFECTS UNFORTUNATELY NO DEFINITION IS GIVEN IN THE INSTRUCTION OF THE WORDS PAUPER AND CON VICT  AND THE RETURNS APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN QUITE INCOMPLETE AT ANY RATE SUCH AN ELABORATION OF THE RETURNS AS WAS POS SIBLE WAS NOT UNDERTAKEN AND THE CENSUS CONTENTS ITSELF WITH RECORDING SIMPLY THE NUMBER OF PRISONERS AND PAUPERS DRAWN NOT FROM THE POPULATION SCHEDULE BUT FROM THAT OF SOCIAL STATISTICS SOMEWHAT MORE ELABORATE ARE THE FIGURES RELATIVE TO 1870 THOUGH HERE AGAIN THE TABULATION WAS CONFINED TO FACTS DRAWN FROM THE SOCIAL SCHEDULE THE PREPARATION OF THESE SCHEDULES RECEIVED GREATER ATTENTION FROM THE CENTRAL OFFICE AND EVERY EFFORT MADE TO SECURE UNI FORMITY IN THE RETURNS A CLEAR DEFINITION OF THE CRIMINALS IS NOT GIVEN AND WE ARE INFORMED IN THE INTRODUCTION THAT THE FIGURES DO NOT RELATE TO INMATES OF HOUSES OF CORRECTION 378THZ DEVELOPMENT OF THE CENSUS OR WORKHOUSES AGAIN SPECIAL SCHEDULES RELATING TO THESE CLASSES FIRST APPEAR IN THE YEAR I880 AND FOR THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE A STUDY OF THE SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CLASSES CONCERNED PRIOR TO THIS DATE WE HAVE NO INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO SUCH IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AS THE CHARACTER OF CRIME COMMITTED AND THE LENGTH OF SENTENCE FOR PRISONERS OR THE CAUSES OF PAUPERISM AND THE NATURE OF THE RELIEF AFFORDED TO PAUPERS THE TABULATION FOR THE YEAR I89O BASED UPON SIMILAR SPECIAL SCHEDULES AMPLIFIED IN CERTAIN DIREC TIONS IS A REMARKABLE ANALYSIS OF THE FACTS IN QUESTION NO MORE COMPLETE STUDY OF POPULATION GROUPS THAN THAT GIVEN IN THIS VOLUME EXISTS ANYWHERE TO THE WRITERS KNOWLEDGE IN PLACES INDEED THE FIGURES ARE OVERELABORATED AND TABLES CONSTRUCTED WHICH SERVE NO USEFUL PURPOSE BUT THIS IS A FAULT WHICH WILL CONCERN THE LEGISLATOR DESIROUS OF THE ECO NOMICAL USE OF PUBLIC MONEY RATHER THAN THE STUDENT UNLESS SUCH EXCESSIVE AND UNNECESSARY WORK IS AT THE COST OF MORE IMPORTANT INQUIRIES ELSEWHERE LESS OBVIOUSLY CONNECTED WITH THE POPULATION SCHEDULE ARE THE VOLUMES RELATING TO MORTALITY AND OTHER VITAL STATIS TICS IN THE UNITED STATES THEY GROW DIRECTLY HOWEVER FROM THE POPULATION SCHEDULE AND DATE FROM THE YEAR I850 WHEN THE FIRST ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO COLLECT VITAL STATISTICS THROUGH THE CENSUS AGENCY IN THAT YEAR A SPECIAL SCHEDULE FOR DEATHS WAS INTRODUCED AND SINCE THEN THE ATTEMPT TO COLLECT VITAL STATISTICS BY THIS METHOD HAS NOT BEEN ABAN DONED THE FIGURES RELATING TO BIRTHS AND MARRIAGES HAVE BEEN CALLED FOR DIRECTLY BY THE POPULATION SCHEDULE THOSE FOR DEATHS HAVE OF NECESSITY BEEN COLLECTED SEPARATELY THE GREAT INTEREST WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN FELT IN MORTALITY STA TISTICS IS DOUBTLESS THE CAUSE OF THE PERSISTENCE OF THIS SCHEDULE IN THE CENSUS THE STATISTICS OF MORTALITY TO BE INSTRUCTIVE MUST BE COMPLETE THOSE OF THE CENSUS ARE NOTORIOUSLY DEFICIENT WHEN FOR INSTANCE THE CENSUS OF I890 GIVES AS THE DEATH RATE IN THE UNITED STATES I39 PER THOUSAND OF THE POPULATION THE MEREST TYRO IN STATISTICS 379 5556 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY KNOWS THAT THE FIGURE IS INCORRECT IT REPRESENTS THE RATIO OF REPORTED DEATHS TO THE POPULATION AND NOT THE RATIO OF THE WHOLE NUMBER OF DEATHS IN SO FAR THEREFORE AS VITAL STATISTICS DEPEND UPON QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENTS THESE VOLUMES MUST BE CHARACTERIZED AS WORTHLESS FEW INQUIRIES IN THE CENSUS REPRESENT SO LARGE AN AMOUNT OF LABOR FOR SO SLIGHT A POSITIVE RESULT IT IS NOT TO BE DENIED THAT THESE STATISTICS GIVE SOME INDICATIONS OF THE PREVALENCE OF CERTAIN TYPES OF DISEASE IN CERTAIN REGIONS BUT THAT IS ALL THAT CAN BE SAID OF THEM THE NEXT GREAT FIELD OF CENSUS INQUIRY WHICH WE MUST CONSIDER IS NOT DIRECTLY CONNECTED WITH THE ENUMERATION OF THE POPULATION AND IS OF INDEPENDENT ORIGIN OF THE CENSUS VOLUMES WHICH HAVE NOT HERETOFORE BEEN NOTICED THE GREATER NUMBER CAN BE INCLUDED UNDER THE HEAD OF STATISTICS OF PRO DUCTION OF THESE THE MOST IMPORTANT ARE THOSE RELATING TO AGRICULTURE MANUFACTURES MINING AND TRANSPORTATION THE DEVELOPMENT OF POPULATION STATISTICS HAS SHOWN US THAT THE IDEA OF UTILIZING THE DECENNIAL ENUMERATION OF THE PEOPLE AS A MEANS OF SECURING IMPORTANT INFORMATION WAS AN EARLY ONE IT WAS NOT HOWEVER UNTIL I8IO THAT IT WAS PROPOSED TO EXTEND THE CENSUS INQUIRIES BEYOND THE STUDY OF THE POPULATION THE ACT OF MAY I I8IO DECLARES THAT THE MARSHALS SHALL REPORT UPON ALL THE ESTABLISHMENTS OF MANU FACTURING INDUSTRIES IN THEIR DISTRICT NO SCHEDULE WAS PRESCRIBED FOR THEIR GUIDANCE BY THE LAW AND THE MATTER SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN LEFT ENTIRELY TO THE DISCRETION OF THE SEC RETARY OF THE TREASURY NOR DID THAT OFFICER TAKE THE TASK SERIOUSLY AND ATTEMPT TO PRODUCE A UNIFORM SCHEDULE APPLI CABLE TO ALL BRANCHES OF MANUFACTURES HE SIMPLY MADE A LIST OF INDUSTRIES WHICH WERE TO BE REPORTED HE DID NOT MAKE IT CLEAR WHAT WAS EXPECTED UNDER EACH HEAD SOME OF HIS QUESTIONS APPEAR TO LOOK TO THE NUMBER OF ESTABLISH MENTS OTHERS TO THE AMOUNT OF THE PRODUCT IN BULK AND STILL OTHERS TO THE VALUE OF THE PRODUCT AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SUCH A HETEROGENEOUS SCHEDULE NO SUMMARY FIGURES COULD 380THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CENSUS BE OBTAINED IN A FORM CAPABLE OF COMPARISON WITH THE CENSUS FIGURES OF A LATER DATE THE MASS OF MATERIAL COLLECTED WAS TURNED OVER TO MR TENCH COXE WHO WITH A FREE USE OF ESTIMATE AND CONJECTURE PREPARED IN 8 14 A STATEMENT OF THE ARTS AND MANUFACTURES IN THE UNITED STATES FOR I8IO IN 1820 ANOTHER ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO SECURE MANUFACTUR ING STATISTICS AND THE SCHEDULE WHICH WAS PREPARED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN QUINCY ADAMS IS MUCH SUPERIOR TO THAT OF THE PREVIOUS CENSUS IT WAS AS FOLLOWS RAW MATERIALSKIND AMOUNT AND VALUE EMPLOYESMEN WOMEN BOYS AND GIRLS MACHINERYTHREE QUESTIONS EXPENDITURESCAPITAL WAGES CONTINGENT NATURE OF PRODUCT VALUE OF PRODUCT REMARKS IN THE ABSENCE OF DEFINITE INSTRUCTIONS IT WILL BE NOTICED THAT THE SCHEDULE IS SOMEWHAT VAGUE AND CAPABLE OF VARYING INTERPRETATION IN SOME OF ITS PARTS IN OTHER CASES THE QUES TIONS ARE DIRECT AND ON THE FACE OF IT SHOULD HAVE GIVEN FAIRLY SATISFACTORY RESULTS BUT THE ADMINISTRATION OF A CENSUS OFFICE OF THOSE DAYS WAS FAR FROM WHAT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN AND SO BADLY WAS THE INQUIRY MANAGED THAT THE RETURNS WHICH WERE PUBLISHED WERE ENTIRELY UNSATISFACTORY INDEED SO GREAT WAS THE DISSATISFACTION WITH THE RESULTS OF THESE INQUIRIES THAT IN 1830 THEY WERE ABANDONED ALTOGETHER IN 1840 THE MANUFACTURING SCHEDULE MARKS A CERTAIN IMPROVE MENT IT ENUMERATES THIRTYONE DIFFERENT CLASSES OF MANU FACTURING INDUSTRY GROUPING THE REMAINDER THOUGH THE PRINTED SCHEDULE IS NOT SPECIFIC IT APPEARS THAT UNDER EACH HEAD THREE QUESTIONS WERE ASKEDVALUE OF THE PRODUCT NUM BER OF PERSONS EMPLOYED AND THE CAPITAL INVESTED MEAGRE AS IS THE INFORMATION ASKED FOR THE RESULTS COULD HAVE BEEN OF SOME VALUE HAD THEY BEEN CARRIED OUT CONSISTENTLY BUT THE THREE QUESTIONS ARE NOT UNIFORMLY ELABORATED A 38I 5758 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY SUMMARY IN THE PREFACE TO THE TENTH CENSUS REPORT ON MANU FACTURES SHOWS THAT MANY ITEMS ARE OMITTED SO THAT TOTALS FOR THE UNITED STATES OR FOR ANY SINGLE STATE CAN NOT BE OBTAINED THIS SUMMARY ALSO SHOWS SIXTEEN SPECIAL INQUIRIES WHICH WERE NOT PROVIDED WITH THE GENERAL SCHEDULE AND HAVE LITTLE RELATION TO IT IT IS CLEAR THAT THE COMPLAINTS WHICH THIS CENSUS GAVE RISE TO IN RELATION TO POPULATION COULD HAVE BEEN MADE WITH EQUAL FORCE WITH REGARD TO MANUFACTURES PUBLIC OPINION BRANDED THE ENTIRE CENSUS AS WORTHLESS AS IN OTHER INQUIRIES WE FIND THE BEGINNING OF MODERN STATISTICS WITH THE CENSUS OF 1850 THE SCHEDULE OF MANU FACTURES IS SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE FORM WHICH WE USE TODAY AND MANY COMPARISONS MAY BE TAKEN BACK TO THAT DATE IT IS ESSENTIALLY AN INDIVIDUAL SCHEDULE EACH ESTABLISHMENT RECORDED BEING GIVEN A DISTINCT LINE THE SCHEDULE CON TAINS FOURTEEN COLUMNS OF WHICH FIVE DESCRIBING THE ESTAB LISHMENT RAW MATERIAL THE PRODUCT AND MOTIVE FORCE ARE NOT STATISTICAL IN CHARACTER THE REMAINING COLUMNS PRO VIDED FOR NUMERICAL STATEMENT OF THE VALUE OF CAPITAL THE AMOUNT AND VALUE OF RAW MATERIAL THE HANDS EMPLOYED MALE AND FEMALE THE AVERAGE MONTHLY WAGES MALE AND FEMALE AND THE AMOUNT AND VALUE OF THE PRODUCT THE STATISTICS OF INDUSTRY UPON SUCH A BASIS MUST NECESSARILY BE COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE IT IS OBVIOUS THAT ONLY TWO PRINCI PLES OF CLASSIFICATION ARE PRACTICABLE A CLASSIFICATION BY LOCALITIES AND A CLASSIFICATION BY INDUSTRIES NO FURTHER DEVELOPMENT IN MANUFACTURING STATISTICS TOOK PLACE UNTIL THE YEAR I880 IN THAT YEAR THE SCHEDULE WAS IMPROVED ESPECIALLY AS REGARDS THE CENSUS OF THE STATEMENT OF WAGES THE QUESTION ASKED IN THIS CENSUS IS AS TO THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF WAGES PAID AND NOT THE AVERAGE WAGE IT IS OBVIOUS THIS QUESTION CAN BE ANSWERED MORE READILY AND MORE CORRECTLY THAN THE PREVIOUS ONE YET THE GREATEST IMPROVEMENT WHICH MARKS THE CENSUS OF I880 WAS IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE MACHINERY THE CENSUS ACT PERMITTED THE SUPERINTENDENT TO WITHDRAW THE SCHEDULES OF INDUSTRY FROM 382THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CENSUS THE HANDS OF THE ORDINARY ENUMERATORS AND PLACE THEM IN THE CARE OF SPECIAL AGENTS AND WHEREVER THERE WAS A GREAT CONCENTRATION OF INDUSTRY AS IN THE CASE OF CITIES THIS WAS DONE WHEREVER THEREFORE INDUSTRY WAS ON A LARGER SCALE THE FACTS WERE COLLECTED BY MORE HIGHLY QUALIFIED AGENTS IN THE MORE DISTINCTIVELY RURAL DISTRICTS THEY REMAINED IN THE HANDS OF THE ENUMERATORS OF THE POPU LATION ANOTHER IMPROVEMENT WAS THE EMPLOYMENT OF EXPERTS UPON SPECIAL TOPICS THEIR REPORTS COMPRISED ABOUT ONE HALF OF THE BULKY VOLUME ON MANUFACTURES OF THE TENTH CEN SUS SOME OF THEM ARE STATISTICAL AS IN THE CASE OF MR HOLLERITHS REPORT ON THE POWER USED IN MANUFACTURING WHILE OTHERS ARE LARGELY HISTORICAL AND DESCRIPTIVE AS IN MR WRIGHTS REPORT ON THE FACTORY SYSTEM THREE VOLUMES OF THE TENTH CENSUS ARE DEVOTED TO THE SUBJECT OF MANUFAC TURES AND ALLIED TOPICS NAMELY VOLUME II MANUFACTURES VOLUME XX WAGES VOLUME XXII POWER AND MACHINERY EMPLOYED IN MANUFACTURES THE WAGES INQUIRY DID NOT RESULT DIRECTLY FROM THE SCHEDULE OF MANUFACTURES BUT WAS A SPECIAL UNDERTAKING COMPRISING A VAST MASS OF INFORMA TION PRINTED IN BULK WITHOUT CLASSIFICATION IN THE ELEVENTH CENSUS MANUFACTURES AGAIN OCCUPIED THREE VOLUMES WHICH SHOW AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE SCHEDULE AND IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE FEATURES A MUCH LARGER PROPORTION OF THE WORK WAS COLLECTED BY SPECIAL AGENTS THAN HERETOFORE WHILE IN THE GENERAL SCHEDULE WE FIND AN ITEMIZATION OF THE FACTS RELATING TO CAPITAL EMPLOYES AND WAGES WHICH SHOULD BE IN THE DIRECTION OF GREATER ACCURACY IN THE PUB LISHED VOLUME WE HAVE A REMARKABLY FULL AND COMPLETE ANALYSIS OF THE RETURNS IN THE OTHER STATISTICS OF PRODUCTION TRANSPORTATION IS MOST CLOSELY ALLIED TO MANUFACTURES IN THE THOROUGHNESS OF THE INQUIRY AND IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS THIS INQUIRY IS A COMPARATIVELY NEW ONE AND FOUND NO PLACE IN THE CENSUS BEFORE THE YEAR I88O 383 5960 ANNAIS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY AGRICULTURE FIRST APPEARS AS A TOPIC FOR CENSUS INQUIRY IN THE CENSUS OF I840 THE DEFECTIVE SCHEDULES OF THAT CENSUS ASKED A FEW QUESTIONS AS TO THE VALUE OF THE PRINCIPAL CROPS BUT NOTHING FURTHER IN I850 WE HAVE A SEPARATE SCHEDULE DEVOTED TO AGRICULTURE EMBODYING INQUIRIES WITH RELATION TO THE SIZE AND VALUE OF FARMS AND THE PRODUCT OF THE MORE FAMILIAR CROPS IN THE NATURE OF THINGS THESE SCHEDULES MUST HAVE BEEN FILLED OUT BY THE SAME ENUMERATORS AS ARE OCCUPIED ON THE POPULATION SCHEDULES AND EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT TOO GREAT AN ELABORATION OF THE QUESTIONS DEFEATS THE PURPOSES OF THE INQUIRY THERE HAS BEEN THEREFORE NO SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE SINCE THE SCHEDULES OF I850 QUESTIONS APPEAR FROM TIME TO TIME AS PUBLIC INTEREST SUGGESTS THE DESIRABILITY AND DISAPPEAR AS EXPERIENCE PROVES THE IMPRAC TICABILITYOF SECURING ADEQUATE INFORMATION UPON THESE POINTS GENERAL RETURNS FROM AGRICULTURE BY THE CENSUS METHODS ARE THEREFORE OF NECESSITY LIMITED TO A FEW TOPICS THE CHANGE WHICH HAS COME OVER THE CENSUS REPORTS ON AGRICULTURE RELATES RATHER TO THE UTILIZATION OF THE RESULTS OBTAINED THAN TO AN ENLARGEMENT OF THE FIELD OF INQUIRY IN I880 WE FIND FOR THE FIRST TIME THE INTRODUCTION OF MONOGRAPHS AND A SEPA RATE TREATMENT OF THE LEADING CROPS AS COMPARED WITH MANUFACTURES THE AVAILABLE MATERIAL IS SCANTIER AND THE ANALYSIS IS LESS COMPLETE MINERAL PRODUCTION WAS AN OBJECT OF CENSUS INQUIRY IN 1840 BUT DISAPPEARED FROM THE LISTS UNTIL I880 IN THE YEAR I880 WE HAVE A VOLUME ON MINERAL PRODUCTION AND ALSO ONE ON MINING LAWS THE LATTER IS OMITTED IN I890 THE FIGURES FOR MINERAL PRODUCTION IN THE CENSUS HAVE BEEN COLLECTED BY SPECIAL AGENTS AND LACK COORDINATION WITH THE OTHER FORMS OF CENSUS INQUIRY THE PUBLISHED REPORTS ARE MAINLY HISTORICAL AND DESCRIPTIVE AND WHILE THEY AFFORD A VALUABLE MONOGRAPHIC TREATMENT OF THE DIFFERENT MINERAL PRODUCTS DO NOT ENTER INTO THE GENERAL SCHEME OF THE CENSUS WORK THUS FAR WE HAVE TRACED THE STATISTICS OF POPULATION AND 384THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CENSUS THE STATISTICS OF PRODUCTION IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO MENTION IN DETAIL ALL OF THE TOPICS WHICH HAVE BEEN SUBJECTS OF INQUIRY AT THE CENSUS SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT IN ADDITION TO THE TOPICS ALREADY MENTIONED THE ELEVENTH CENSUS CON TAINS VOLUMES RELATING TO CHURCHES TO WEALTH DEBT AND TAXATION TO INSURANCE TO ALASKA INDIANS MORTGAGES FARM AND HOME PROPRIETORSHIP AND INDEBTEDNESS IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO RECOUNT THE STAGES BY WHICH THESE INQUIRIES HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE CENSUS IT IS ENOUGH TO NOTE THE FACT THAT THEY WERE INCLUDED IN IT THE UTILIZATION OF THE CENSUS AS A MEANS OF SECURING STA TISTICAL INFORMATION HAS PROGRESSED TO A POINT WHICH MAKES IT A MOST GIGANTIC UNDERTAKING TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT THE CENSUS SHOULD BE CONFINED TO ITS CONSTITUTIONAL OBJECT THE ASCERTAINMENT OF THE POPULATIONALL OF THESE INQUIRIES ARE OBVIOUSLY SUPERFLUOUS WHILE IN TIMES PAST SUCH A NARROW VIEW HAS FREQUENTLY BEEN EXPRESSED BY MEN EMINENT IN THE COUNCILS OF THE NATION IT HAS NOT BEEN HEARD SO FRE QUENTLY OF LATE THE UTILITY OF CENSUS WORK MAY BE DEEMED DEFINITELY ESTABLISHED CURRENT CRITICISM OF THE MAGNITUDE OF CENSUS OPERATIONS IS BASED ON THE DUPLICATION OF LABOR BY THE CENSUS OF WORK CARRIED ON BY OTHER ORGANS OF THE GOV ERNMENT AND AGAIN ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES WHICH SURROUND SO HUGE AN UNDERTAKING IT IS NOT PROBABLE THAT A CENSUS WILL AGAIN BE UNDERTAKEN OF THE SIZE OF THE ELEVENTH OR OF THE TENTH IT IS FELT THAT THE EXPANSION OF THE CENSUS WORK HAS BEEN AT THE COST OF ACCURACY AND EFFECTIVENESS AND THAT IT HAS BEEN A PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE DELAY IN THE PUBLICATION OF CENSUS RESULTS WHICH HAS BEEN SO FREQUENTLY CRITICISED MEASURES NOW UNDER CONSIDERATION LOOK TO A REDISTRIBUTION OF CENSUS INQUIRIES SO THAT THE CON CENTRATION OF THE NUMEROUS INQUIRIES IN A SINGLE YEAR MAY BE AVOIDED IT IS TO BE SINCERELY HOPED THAT THESE PLANS WILL NOT LEAD TO THE OMISSION OF ANYTHING WHICH IS REALLY VALUABLE IN THE CENSUS WORK AS THIS WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE A STEP BACKWARD A CRITICAL ESTIMATION OF WHAT IS GOOD AND 38562 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY WHAT IS BAD WHAT INDISPENSABLE AND WHAT SUPERFLUOUS WOULD LEAD FAR BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THIS PAPER SUCH AN EXHAUSTIVE CRITICISM IS MUCH NEEDED BUT MUST BE A COOPER ATIVE WORK SINCE IT MAY WELL BE DOUBTED WHETHER ANY STA TISTICIAN OF REPUTE HAS THE OMNISCIENCE ESSENTIAL TO SUCH A LABOR OR THE TEMERITY TO UNDERTAKE IT ROLAND P FALKNER

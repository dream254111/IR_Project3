Mexico and other govern ments and scientific societies of Europe and America it has been decided to establish an International School of American Archeology and Ethnology in the City of Mexico and as the honor of being the first director of the school has fallen to my share I beg leave to place before this illus trious assembly the reasons which deter mined the patrons and protectors of the school to found it and to dwell a little more fully on the ends that we hope to achieve in this new institution We call our school the International School of American Archeology and Eth nology that is to say we wish to treat two sciences the importance of which is more and more clearly recognized in our day and which are in reality sistersfor what we call archeology is but a branch of ethnology from which it differs rather in method than in aim Archeology has reached its highest development and 1 Inaugural address of the director at the open ing of the International School of American Archeology and Ethnology in Mexico City on January 20 Porfirio Diaz president of the Mex ican republic opened the school in the presence of the ministers of state and public instruction of the republic of the ambassadors of countries that participate in the establishment of the school and of many prominent citizens After the inaugural address by Professor Seler and an address by Sefior Ezequiel A Chivez subsecretary of public instruction who dwelt on the impor tance of international cooperation in the estab lishment of the school the president declared the school openedN S VOL XXXIII No 846 achieved its greatest triumphs in classical archeology and in the prehistoric archeol ogy of Europe For centuries the political and civil history of the Romans Greeks and Oriental nations have been taught in the schools of the Old World By the efforts of thousands of learned and industrious investigators whatever knowledge could be obtained from descriptions and reports of historians from the study of monuments that have survived the destruction of the old world has been recorded and secured for the benefit of scientists and of the gen eral public We may say without exag geration that an exact knowledge of the political and social life and of the char acteristics of the individual life of the people of antiquity a true concept of the extent of the influences arising therefrom of the influences these civilizations re ceived from the neighboring countries and of the source from which they sprangwas not attained until ancient history applied archeological methods until by the use of the spade were unearthed the homes graves utensils arms ornaments cos tumes the remains of human bodies and the wormeaten literature of that ancient people Thus it was proved that field work was most necessary for the progress of arche ology underground lie the documents truthful witnesses of the ancient civiliza tions about which we read underground lie also the remains that are witnesses of civilizations and the forms of primitive development of which no historian has written a single word It is only neces sary to bring them to light However for this kind of work the energies of a single man are insufficient no matter how skill ful diligent or learned he may be Nor are the means sufficient which a scientist standing alone has at his disposal For these reasons in different countries of the European continent the govern ments have taken upon themselves to es tablish and support institutions to appoint directors and assistants who are charged with the task of exploring the centers of ancient civilizations in the classic soil of Italy Greece Egypt Babylonia Assyria and other parts of the world Associations of private citizens interested in this subject compete with the governments In this way were organized the French German English and Austrian schools and those of the United States of America and other nations in Rome Athens Smyrna Cairo Crete Babylon etc In establishing the institutions the gov ernments scientists and scientific societies had a double purpose The first and fore most was of course to learn as accurately and as completely as possible the character istics of that great civilization whose heirs are we who live in Europe now and which has spread to this continent and to other parts of the world To accomplish this purpose it was important to preserve the relies that were found to collect small ob jects and to note the places where they were discovered and the manner in which they had been deposited and to keep them in museums The other object which the governments and scientific associations wished to attain was more particularly of an educational character This purpose was partly ac complished by the museums which were enriched by the finds made by archeological research The peculiar traits as well as the artistic character of the remains that had been collected were admirably adapted to impress the imagination and to teach the young There are however a great many things which can not be kept in museums and there are many others which can only be seen and studied in the museums of the countries in which they have been found 398 SCIENCEMACOH 17 1911 There aremost important of allthe people the descendants of the ancient civil ized nations their countries their skies their climate their whole environment their way of living and the whole combina tion of imponderable agencies the knowl edge of which enables the student to under stand the thousand peculiarities of the life and fate of the people All of these and the particular methods of investigation were what was desired to teach the young in the schools of archeology that have been established with so much liberality in the classic countries of the Old World Work of this kind has been in operation for generations and with marked success Whole cities arose anew from the accumu lation of debris of thousands of years that had covered them temples with rich orna mentation were restored the secrets of the Egyptian pyramids of the temples of Babylonia and Assyria were brought to our view together with countless objects many of which were of inestimable value These were preserved to delight the eye and satisfy the mind of mankind and from them many students have learned to see understand and work On the American continent in the United States and in the Dominion of Can ada great interest was manifested in the ethnology of the Indian races and in its antiquities ever since the middle of the past century Scientific associations and private parties rivalled in collecting data and documents and the governments aided by liberal means undertook the direction of the investigation Recently archeolog ical investigations have also been instituted on a larger scale in South America in the Argentine Republic particularly in the Andean region of that republic Some thing has also been done in Brazil Bolivia Peru and Ecuador by the cooperation of private parties institutions of the United States and the governments of South America Some foreigners have also worked in the republics of Central Amer ica as well as in Yucatan and Chiapas the Englishman Alfred P Maudslay the Frenchman D6sire Charney the investiga tors of the Peabody Museum of Cambridge Mass the Germans Berendt and Teoberto Maler the Swedes Bovallius and Hartman Great additions to our knowledge of the ancient peoples of those regions were de rived from their work In Mexico the ex plorations authorized by the government in Xochicalco Cempoallan Monte Alban and Teotihuacan have contributed much to en large and deepen our knowledge Magnifi cent monuments which were little known and which were covered by dbris or hid den by tropical vegetation were unveiled This work awakened more and more in terest among the educated classes of other countries and especially among our neigh bors to the north Thus arose the idea of cooperation of the union of efforts of the necessity of establishing a center to direct the work at which the young student can learn who full of enthusiasm for those studies might wish to come here to learn what books and the objects accumulated in museums could not teach him This was the object and aim in founding a school of the same kind as existed in Rome and with the same aims but international in character It is not necessary to enter into details to show the particular opportunities of such a school in this country but we shall be grateful to those who initiated and fathered the idea for the zeal and per severance with which they worked to ac complish their end We must be grateful particularly to the government of this re public that owns this soil and to the min istry of public instruction whose solicitude for the study and preservation of all the archeological treasures of this country is SCIENCE 399N S VOL XXXIII No 846 well known and which with great kindness supported the project and lent it its effi cient aid Permit me now to set forth in a few words the tasks that this new institution will have to take up and the way in which I think the work should proceed The historian places the highest value on the testimony he can gather from living witnesses The descendants of the ancient peoples of this country in so far as they still speak their old languages and observe their old customs are in a way living wit nesses whose testimony is of value for the knowledge of ancient history ancient polit ical and social life The Indian of this country holds so tenaciously to his old cus toms he is so devoted to the soil of his birth and that of his ancestors that only by main force can he be taken from it When we remember that since the time of the Conquest all hostilities and wars between the tribes have ceased we may take it for granted that on the whole and with few exceptions the geographical dis tribution of tribes that exists today is the same as at the time of the Conquest that is to say that if a certain native language is now spoken in a certain place we may assume until the contrary is proven that the same language was spoken there at the time of the Conquest For this reason it is of the greatest importance not only for the ethnologist but also for the historian and archeologist to have an exact knowledge of the geographical distribution of the Indian languages spoken today and for this rea son I consider the preparation of a map that will give all the details of this dis tribution as one of the labors that should occupy the attention of the International School of Archaeology and Ethnology es tablished today The people who speak the same language do not necessarily form a homogeneous group there are differences among them which correspond to the diversity of place and condition in which they live or lived and to their history Such differences ex press themselves even in language and for this reason the study of the dialects is also essential for historical investigation and will form one of the tasks of the Inter national School We are grateful to my distinguished colleague Dr Boas who of fers his thorough knowledge and experi ence in this laborious enterprise Another help in our investigation that may be of great value are the Indian people of today in so far as they still retain the customs of their forefathers of the time of the Conquest and in so far as they still retain the traditions beliefs and tales adulterated or not which belonged to the time of paganism The folklore of the Indian tribes of this country will be an other and very important part of the labors of our school Lastly we should not forget to study the industries and art of the Indian people however much they may have been influ enced mixed and changed by the artistic style and the industries that the Spaniards brought with them there remain in many places the survivals of ancient industry designs and forms that remind us of an cient styles that will be of value for pur poses of comparison and that may complete the history of ancient design and help us in its interpretation Archeology properthat is to say the ethnology of the races and peoples that no longer existhas the same aims as ethnol ogy but its methods are much more lim ited The archeologist can not collect at will from living people the elements of the language that was spoken the traditions the tales the beliefs and all the evidence of mental development He must be satis fied with what writers of earlier times 400 SCIENCEMABcH 17 1911 8CIEW1V investigators historians or general writers considered worth while to note down Nor can the archeologist investigate the entire cultural work of a race or people He can only depend upon the little that good fortune has saved from general de struction caused by the violence of man by his negligence and the destructive agen cies of time climate and vegetation The more is it important for the scientists to collect all the evidence important as well as that of seeming insignificance to keep account of the notes that refer to the evi dence to its origin etc and to utilize thoroughly the written documents the de scriptions of historians and of the contem poraries of those times in order to obtain from these documents all possible help for the interpretation of the history of the people Useful documents are not lacking in this countrythat is in the region with which historians have particularly occupied them selvesin this valley in the environment of the capital and among the Tlatepotzcas people that live beyond the mountains in Cholula Tlaxcala and its dependencies the home of the nation or nations that were leaders in this country Beyond the limits of the central region in the provinces the reports and documents are very scarce There is no Sahagun for Michoacan and the northeast nor for the Otomis near neighbors of the Mexicans of the central region nor for the gulf coast nor for the great and rich provinces of the Zapotecas and Mixtecas and the same is true of the region of the isthmus and the different parts of the people of the Maya family Regarding all these large provinces we have not more than scattered notes and few incoherent accounts Here archeology is the only means that can furnish the data or any data necessary for the reconstruc tion of the history of these ancient people and the characteristics of their civiliza tions The International School in its arche ological department will in the first place study the monuments that are in existence and that are accessible making compari sons and trying to interpret them by means of the old trustworthy accounts and by means of what may be gleaned from the paintings the contemporaries of pagan times or of those made not long after the Conquest The Maya monuments are a problem in themselves As this people had developed the art of writing to a higher degree than any other people on this continent having originated very nearly a true hieroglyphic writing and as at the same time they used these characters and signs frequently in their books as well as in their architecture the Maya monuments should teach us more than those that are found in other parts Unfortunately in that region an authori tative interpretation is lacking entirely Some of the characters have been de ciphered much more remains to be de ciphered The International School will also apply its efforts to this important but difficult branch of the investigation The principal work with which the In ternational School will occupy itself will be the search for new material choosing appropriate places for which the authori ties in whose charge the preservation of the monuments of the country is placed will give the needed authority discovering measuring and studying what is found looking for and bringing together detached pieces taking photographs and drawings of entire monuments of special details opening burials and securing the contents for the museum of the nation The school will make efforts to fill in the fragmentary picture of our knowledge in order to give us a better idea of the differ 401N S VOL XXXIII No 846 ent civilizations that existed in this coun tryan idea that unfortunately the writers of earlier times did not give us At the same time we must not forget to study the cultural strata to see if there be in some place some means of arriving at a classification or chronological order in which the civilizations followed one an other a history that we have not been able to establish up to this day All these propositions will require the cooperation of the young who will learn and will in turn become our teachers who will con tinue our work disregarding and boldly setting aside the doubts and hesitancies of the old and who will not fear to open new paths and with youthful vigor bring to a happy end what we have only been able to begin EDUARD SELER THE PLACE OF RESEARCH IN UNDER GRADUATE SCHOOLS1 THE aim of this academy is the encour agement of research along scientific lines by establishing and maintaining inter course among those engaged therein thus stimulating them by a consciousness of companionship in productive intellectual activity In a small society embracing in its scope all the sciences one does not ex pect in these days of specialization to find others engaged in just the same field of investigation as himself it is through in spiration rather than information that the investigator profits by these meetings It is now hardly necessary to emphasize even to the nonscientific public the impor tance of scientific research to it mankind owes in a large measure not only his ma terial prosperity comforts and conve niences which is sufficiently obvious but what is even more important his intellec tual freedom The changes that have taken place within the last century in our 1Address of the president of the Indiana Academy of Science November 25 1910 physical environment with the innumer able applications of science to useful pur poses are no more profound than our in tellectual advance and the growing per vasiveness of the scientific spirit in all lines of thought and endeavor for human better ment physical social and moral Our in creasingly extensive and effective philan thropies our giant strides in sanitary ad ministration and the tottering barriers between the sects of Christendom are very tangible evidences of the spirit that is not satisfied with precedent or authority but craves certainty as to the facts and reason able explanations for them as well as the application of all knowledge to the uses of man The membership of this academy hap pily includes scientific workers in many fields Some apply the results of research to the needs of the state in developing its resources and protecting its citizens against the injuries inflicted by ignorance and fraud others make science the servant of industry and commerce others again are active in applying it to the preserving and restoring of the health of our bodies A large part of our membership however is made up of those whose chief occupation is teaching While it has not always been the case it is probably true at present that the most valuable contributions to human knowledge are made by those engaged in this profes sion of teaching This is not surprising for the nature of his calling demands that the teacher to be effective must ever con tinue to be a student and the thorough study of any subject reveals the limits of our knowledge in that field and tempts the man of active intellect to the task of ex tending those boundaries there is surely no keener pleasure than the learning by ones own search some truth however in conspicuous not previously known 402 SCIENCE

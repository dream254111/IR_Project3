economic factors In a recent trip to the Louisiana strawberry fields April 1915 I found the same fungi present upon berries still in the fields The fungi have been isolated in pure culture and inoculations made It seems desirable there fore to call attention to them at this time A complete presentation of their study will be made later Strawberry Fruit Rot Due to Patellina Sp This rot begins either on green or ripe berries as a microscopic spot which enlarges slowly in green berries and more rapidly in ripe ones In ripe berries the spot becomes sunken the area tan colored The margin is quite definite The surface is soon studded thickly with sporodochia which vary from globular to patelliform to saucershaped usually with a distinct often wrinkled sterile margin In color they vary from hyaline to tan or when resting on the ripe berry they may take on completely the color of the berry The core of the diseased spot is completely occupied by the mycelium rendering it of spongy tenacious texture The host cells along a narrow line separating the diseased from the normal area are softened and separ ated from each other evidently by enzyme action It is therefore possible to lift out in its entirety the diseased tissue The spot in a ripe berry increases in size sufficiently fast to involve the whole of a large berry in about four days The fungus has been isolated and positive inoculations have been made It clearly belongs to the genus Patellina and ap pears to be as yet undescribed Strawberry Fruit Rot Due to Spheronemella e11  Sp THIS rot occurs with or separate from the one above described It differs distinctly in character of spot and is much less rapid in its effects The spot is not definitely bounded nor is there such evidence of enzyme action as de scribed above The affected berry soon becomes completely covered with the pycnidia which are tancolored to black distinctly rostrate arnd are of such peculiar gelatinous texture that berries affected with this disease can be dis tinguished by feeling of them The causal fungus has been isolated and positive inoculations have been made It is a Sphtcronemella apparently quite distinct from Zythia fragaric Laib and seems to be un described Each of the above fungi has been found re peatedly on market berries and they are clearly present in sufficient frequency to render them of considerable economic significance Strawberry Black Rot Due to SplEcropsis LAST year both in Louisiana and in the market here I frequently found berries which showed a very peculiar blackening or a bronzed appearance Such berries rotted down dry and eventually shrivelled Examination showed the presence of abundant dark coarse mycelium similar to that of Sphcropsis malorum and of pycnidia and spores also as yet indistinguish able from that fungus This disease was not nearly so abundant as the two above described and is not of much economic significance F L STEVENS URBANA ILL May 3 1915 SOCIETIES AND ACADEMIES THE BOTANICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON THE 105th regular meeting of the Botanical So ciety of Washington was held in the Assembly Hall of the Cosmos Club at 8 PM Tuesday May 4 1915 Thirtythree members and four guests were present Dr George R Lyman was elected to membership Dr Camillo Schneider general secretary of the Dendrologischen Gesellsehaft of AustriaHungary was present as a guest of the society The scientific program was as follows The Botany of Western Yunna China DR CAMILLO SCHNEIDER Dr Schneider has just returned from a years journey in the high mountains of western Yunna He has carried on in the region of the upper Yangtze investigations in botany zoology and ethnology He obtained a great number of colored photographs taken from nature Lumiere auto chromes of which he exhibited 25 with the lan 913N S VOL XLI  No 1068 tern These showed most interesting plant types of the high mountains near Li Chiang at an ele vation of 10000 to 17000 feet Especially strik ing was a new Primula first discovered a few years ago with a spiked inflorescence which more resembles an orchid than a Primula It has been named P Littoniana The buds are of a dark purple while the open flowers are colored A very peculiar plant of biological interest is a new Saussurea which inhabits limestone boulders at about 17000 feet and has the flowers hidden among the leaves which are densely hairy and protect them from snow and frost The virgin forest of the Li Chiang zone consists of Pinus Massoniana various Piceas Abies Delavaya Tsuga Ytincnanensis evergreen oaks many Rhodo dendrons and numerous other shrubs and herbs The cryptogamic flora is also very rich Dr Schneider has collected over 3000 different species of phanerogams and ferns The Genus Endothia DR N E STEVENS To be published in full elsewhere Endothia Pigments Da LON A HAWKINS To be published in full elsewhere Identification of the Teonanacatl or Sacred Mushroom of the Aztecs with the Narcotic Cactus Lophophora Williamsii and an Account of its Ceremonial Use in Ancient and Modern Times MRn W E SAmrORD The early Spanish writers describe certain feasts of the Aztecs in which a narcotic called by them teoanancatl or sacred mushrom was used as an intoxicant Bernardino Sahagun writing be fore 1569 states that it was the Chichimeca In dians of the north who first discovered the proper ties and made use of these evil mushrooms which intoxicate like wine Hernandez distin guishes them from other mushrooms nanacame plural of nanacatl which are used as food by the distinguishing adjective teyhuinti inebriating quoniam inebrare solent The belief survives that the drug thus used was a mushroom accord ing to REmi Sim6on the teonanacatl is une espece de petit champignon qui a mauvais gout enivre et cause des halluciations 1 Investi gations of the author have proved that the drug in question is not a fungus but a small fleshy spine less cactus endemic on both sides of the Rio Grande in the vicinity of Laredo Texas and in the state of Coahuila ranging southward to the states of Zacatecas San Luis Potosi and Queretaro a re gion inhabited in ancient times by the tribes 1 Diet de la langue Nahuatl p 436 1885 called Chichimecas The drug is prepared in two principal forms 1 discoid in which the head of the plant is cut off transversely and when dried bears a close resemblance to a mushroom 2 in longitudinal pieces or irregular fragments in which the entire plant including the tap root is sliced longitudinally into strips like a radish or parsnip bearing no resemblance whatever to a mushroom and designated by early writers as peyotl and also as raiz diabolica or devils root  The first to call attention to the ceremonial or religious use of this drug by the Indians of to day was Mr James Mooney of the Bureau of American Ethnology in a paper read before the Anthropological Society of Washington November 3 1891 Since the time of Mr Mooneys observa tions the use of the drug has spread widely among the Indians of the United States by whom it is commonly called mescal button or peyote Efforts have been made to prevent the Indians from using it chiefly because it is believed by some of those interested in the Christianizing of the Indians that it has a tendency to make them revert to their primitive condition and to their heathen beliefs Action was taken in the courts to prosecute a certain Indian for furnishing this drug to the Indians of the Menominee Reservation of Wisconsin on March 15 1914 It developed that the drug was received by parcel post from the vicinity of Laredo Texas In a paper before the Lake Mohonk Conference in October 1914 affi davits of certain Indians of the Omaha and Winnebago tribes of the Nebraska reservation were read The evidence showed that there is a religious organization among the Indians called the Sacred Peyote Society the ceremonial meetings of which are remarkably like those of the ancient Mexicans in which the sacred mush room was eaten and the physiological effects as described by those partaking of the drug were identical with those attributed by the early writers to the teotanacatl The chemical proper ties of the drug have been studied in Germany and the United States especially by Lewin of Berlin Heffter of Leipsic and the late Ervin E Ewell of the Bureau of Chemistry U S De partment of Agriculture and the physiological ef fects by Drs D W Prentiss and Francis P Mor gan of Washington D C but it is not possible to give the detailed results of these investigations in the scope of the present paper As far as the author knows this is the first 914 SCIENCEJUNE 18 1915 SCIENCE time the identity of the sacred mushroom or Cflesh of the gods with the narcotic cactus known botanically as Lophophora Williamsii has been pointed out That the drug was mistaken for a mushroom by the Aztecs and early Spaniards is not surprising when one bears in mind that the potato Solanum tuberosum on its introduction into Europe was popularly regarded as a kind of truffle a fact which is recorded by its German name Kartoffel or Tartuffel PERLEY SPAULDING Corresponding Secretary THE BIOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON THE 542d meeting of the society was held in the Assembly Hall of the Cosmos Club Saturday May 15 1915 called to order at 8 PI by President Bartsch with 43 persons present On recommendation of the Council Francis N Balch Boston Mass and Ernest P Walker Wrangell Alaska were elected to active member ship Under heading exhibition of specimens Dr L 0 Howard showed lantern slides from photographs of the moth Ceratomia amyntor bringing out its protective coloration while at rest on bark The first paper of the regular program was by C H T Townsend Two Years Investigation in Peru of Verruga and its Insect Transmission Dr Townsend said The four stages of verruga are defined as incu bative fever quiescent and eruptive The most important symptom of the fever stage is the pres ence of bacilliform bodies Bartonia bacilliformis Strong et al in the erythrocytes The histology of the eruptive papules is not yet sufficiently de fined for positive diagnosis in the absence of the clinical history but its chief feature is a marked proliferation of angioblasts Verrugas Canyon is the best known and prob ably one of the strongest endemic foci of the dis ease Extended investigations were carried on there both day and night at all seasons of the year The result was an ecological demonstration of Phlebotomus verrucarum Townsend as the vec tor of the disease This demonstration is built on the unique etiological conditions already known Verruga can be acquired only by direct inocula tion into the blood is only contracted at night is confined to very restricted areas within which it is almost universally contracted at any time of year by nonimmunes who remain from seven to ten consecutive nights These conditions necessitate a bloodsucking vector which is abundant active only at night but throughout the year and whose dis tribution is coterminous with the infected areas The above Phlebotomus is the only bloodsucker which meets these requirements Clinical verification of the vector was obtained from the history of numerous cases of verruga ob served by Dr Townsend Transmissional demon stration in laboratory animals lacked completeness only by reason of the impossibility of positively diagnosing verruga eruptive tissue papules having been produced in the animals by injections of the crushed Phlebotomus A biting experiment in man was carried through resulting in what appeared to be a light infection This was the case of McGuire who exhibited all the symptoms but with a paucity of the bacilliform bodies in the erythrocytes Papules appeared sparingly after the subject had been discharged Dr Townsend s assistant Mr Nicholson acci dentally received many Phlebotomus bites thereby furnishing a clean experiment with two checks The checks were Dr Townsend and his assistant Mr Rust both of whom were subjected to ex actly the same conditions as Mr Nicholson except that they did not receive the bites They did not contract the disease while Mr Nicholson showed a wellmarked case with both the bacilliform bod ies in the erythrocytes and the characteristic eruption Lizards were suggested as a possible reservoir of verruga from the fact that they were the only vertebrates aside from man domestic or wild at Verrugas Canyon whose blood showed bacilliform bodies The lizards inhabit the numerous loose rock walls which everywhere in the Andean region take the place of fences and these are the favorite diurnal hiding places of the Phlebotomus swarms Injection of the lizard blood into guineapigs re sulted in similar bodies in the erythrocytes of the injected animal The unity of verruga was insisted on in opposi tion to the thesis of Dr R P Strong and his as sociates The entire Peruvian medical fraternity concur in this view The facts given in support of it appear to be irreconcilable with the opposite view Prophylactic measures were outlined and the remarkably perfect climatic conditions of the ver ruga zones unequaled for sanatoria were dwelt on The paper will be published in full in the Amer ican Journal of Tropical Diseases and Preventzve Medicine Dr Townsends paper was illustrated by lantern 915N S VOL XLI No 1068 slides made from photographs of Bartonia bacilli formis of clinical cases of the micropathology of the Phlebotomzus and of Verrugas Canyon etc It was discussed by Admiral G  W Baird and medical inspector H E Ames The second paper of the regular program was by W Dwight Pierce The Uses of Weevils and Weevil Products in Food and Medicine Mr Pierce described in particular the trehala manna of Syria which is the cocoon of the large weevil known as Larinuts nidificans These cocoons are used by the natives as a food similar to tapioca and are also commonly sold in drug stores for use in making a decoction said to be efficacious against bronchial catarrh The cocoons are made by an abdominal excretion of the larva and contain a large percentage of sugar known as trehalose as well as a carbohydrate a little gum and a small amount of inorganic mineral matter Specimens of the trehala manna and of the weevil were exhibited The third communication was by L 0 Howard Some Observations on Mosquitoes and House Flies Dr Howard spoke of the work which is being done in New Jersey against mosquitoes de scribing the organization of county inspectors which was effected at Atlantic City in February at an antimosquito convention He showed a series of lantern slides illustrating the very effec tive work done by the Essex County Commission in the vicinity of Newark N J He then spoke of work done by Mr Hutchinson of the Bureau of Entomology in regard to trapping the maggots of the house fly illustrating his remarks with lantern slides showing a large outdoor maggot trap in use during the summer of 1914 under Mr Hutchin sons direction at College Park Md The illus trations in question appear in U S Department of Agriculture Bulletin No 200 The last communication was by A L Quaint ance Remarks on Some Littleknown Insect Depredators  Mr Quaintance called attention to certain spe cies of insects which have but recently come into prominence as of economic importance and to other species which although long known to ento mologists as occasional pests have recently at tracted attention in view of local outbreaks A species of Jasside Typhlocyba obliqua is at the present time seriously destructive to apples in por tions of the Ozark mountain region and in Kan sas These insects occurred in countless numbers in some orchards infesting the lower surface of the leaves causing the foliage to drop with subse quent injury to the fruit crop and the trees A Tineid insect of the genus Marmcara was reported to have caused a good deal of injury to certain apple orchards in Albemarle County Virginia The caterpillar makes long serpentine mines under the skin of the apple resulting in blemishes The eeping quality of the fruit is also lessened The common walking stick Diapheromera femorata while often the cause of more or less local defolia tion in forests occasionally becomes a serious pest in orchards especially in orchards adjacent to woodlands These walking sticks have recently been coinmined of on account of important in juries to apple and peach orchards in Virginia and West Virginia Rhabdopterus picipes a Chrysome lid beetle has recently been discovered as damag ing cranberries The insect is a near relative of the grape root worm Fidia viticida and the larvme work on the roots of cranberry feeding principally on the fibrous roots but also stripping the bark from the older roots Investigations of the insect by Mr H B Scammell indicate that it is re stricted in cranberry bogs to the higher and sandier soils Nezara hilaris one of the stink bugs and long known to feed on vegetation of various sorts has recently become very abundant and destructive to peaches in the Marblehead district in northern Ohio These plant bugs in feeding insert their beaks in the developing fruit causing the peaches to become knotty and misshapen as they grow and many of which fall from the trees Parandra brunnea better known as the chestnut telephone borer following investigations by Mr Snyder has been determined by Mr Fred E Brooks to be very generally present in the heartwood of old apple trees and as a result of its work the trees are often so weakened that they are easily broken or blown over by winds Various species of Cecidomyidme are known to be serious crop pests as the sorghum midge the pear midge etc A new midge pest Contarina johnsoni has during recent years come into prominence on account of its in juries to grapes in the Chautauqua and Erie grape belts The adults oviposit in the blossom buds which may contain from 1070 maggots though the average number is much less Many blossoms are thus destroyed resulting in very ragged and imperfect bunches of grapes This paper was illustrated by lantern slides showing the insects and their work from photo graphs prepared mostly by Mr J H Paine At 1015 the society adjourned until October M W LYON Ja Recording Secretary 916 SCIENCE

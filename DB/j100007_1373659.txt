attracted the attention of zoologists Since the times of Cuvier the subject has been treated by H v Meyer Pomel Riitimeyer Owen Major Neh ring Woldrich and many others and a great number of forms have been described until in 1886 Lydekkerl provisionally grouped them under two headings Equus caballus Linnaeus and Equus stenonis Cocchi Thus matters stood when in 1899 Boule2 in a most suggestive paper pointed out that in addition to these a third species Equus robustus Pomel could be distinguished which although approaching the caballus type was he thought more nearly related to stenonis Since 1904 Professor Ewart3 of Edinburgh has taken up the subject with a view to elucidating the origin of domestic horses According to his theory4 three types of domestic and ancestral wild horses can be distinguished a Plateau variety including the Celtic pony and the Arab which can be traced back to the Pliocene Equus sivalensis5 a Forest variety typified by the heavy draught horses of continental Europe and descended from Pomels Equus robustus and a Steppe variety still found in a wild state in Mongolia Equus przewalskii which has influenced some of the races of European carthorses Some more recent papers by Soergel6 Antonius7 and Boule8 may be mentioned here and finally an elaborate paper by v Reichenau9 in which a num ber of new species and two new genera are described which however has more confused than cleared the subject 1 Cat Foss Mamm B M III pp 6971 7388 1886 2 Bull Soc Geol France 3 XXVII pp 53142 text fig 122 1899 March 1900 3 The most important of these papers are the

150SCHWARZEUROPEAN FOSSIL HORSES The evidence afforded by fossil bones and teeth found in Europe Asia and Africa appears to admit only two general types In the species named stenonis atlanticus persicus etc the anterior pillar protocone of the premolars and molars is short generally only one third of the total length of the tooth with the anterior lobe scarcely developed and the interior margin mostly convex straight or only slightly bent in at the middle The enamel folds are moderately developed the paracone and metacone are thick and their lateral sur face convex and the parastyle and mesostyle narrow and if at all only doubled in the anterior premolars The eye sockets are some what projecting and the angle of the lower jaw is deep In the limbs the lower portions radiusmetacarpal and tibiametatarsal are com paratively long and narrow the upper portions humerus femur shorter than in the next species0 In the other type to which such names as caballus pticidens robus tus sussenbornensis mosbachensis przewalskii etc have been applied the anterior pillar of the cheek teeth is generally longer usually more than one third of the total length of the tooth with the posterior lobe always and the anterior one in many cases of considerable size the interior margin being always bent in or even sharply divided at the middle The enamel folds are more pronounced the paracone and metacone distinctly lunate and their outer border concave and the parastyle and mesostyle more imposing and doubled in most of the cheek teeth the eye sockets are not projecting and the angle of the lower jaw is much less deep The metatarsals and metacarpals are as a rule comparatively shorter and broader in specimens from older strata but about as slender as in the former species in more recent ones The upper portions of the limbs humerus femur are however some what longer compared to the lower portions tibia metatarsus etc It has hitherto been supposed that Equus sivalensis belongs to the first or stenonis type But a renewed examination of Mr Lydekkers beautiful plates1 makes me believe that it is a member of the caballus series The shape of the protocone paracone and metacone and of the para and mesostyle are decidedly of this type This is still more so in Equus namadicus which is probably the direct descendant of E sivalensis and apparently similar in the Ceylon tooth described by 0 Lydekker Guide to the specimens of the Horse family p 26 1907 11 Mem Qeol Surv India Palaentologia Indica 10 II pl XIV XV 1882 151JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY Wayland12 as Equus zeylanicus and in Equus leptostylus Matsumoto13 from Honan China Lydekker has made a strong case of the presence in E sivalensis E stenonis and the Arab of a preorbital depression but since the same character is found in the southern but not in the northern local races of E quagga I cannot regard it as of specific value It has frequently been maintained that the horses of the second caballusrobustus type were derived from those of the stenonis group chiefly on the assumption 1 that stenonis is older Pliocene 2 that in some of the older specimens of robustus only a rather small proto cone is found in the cheekteeth This is disproved however by a tooth from the Red Crag of Bawdsey Suffolk4 contemporaneous with or even older than stenonis and distinguishable except in size from the most recent teeth of E cabaltus only in details discussed below I am not quite satisfied whether the remains usually referred to E stenonis and robustus respectively from the Oreston Cave near Ply mouth from Kents Hole near Torquay from the lower deposits at Mosbach near Wiesbaden and from the older Auvergne strata are all found in the same horizon but this is of little importance since the Bawdsey tooth5 is older than either of them There is no doubt therefore that both species occurred together in Europe during upper Pliocene and probably also basal Pleistocene times I shall now designate the first of these types as Equus stenonis The names atlanticus ligeris mauretanicus persicus16 and stenonis decidedly belong to this species and may be races of it their exact value and relation among each other I am not at present prepared to state Remains of Pliocene age have been found at Maragha in northern Persia in the Val dArno Italy at various localities in France southern Germany AustriaHungary and southern England some as those of Mosbach or the Norfolk Forest Beds as well as some of the British caverns are early Pleistocene the most recent materials appear to be those from northern Africa which have been described 12Spolia Zeylan X pp 261280 1916 the tooth of E caballus figured for comparison obviously belongs to an Indian domestic horse and is of the Arab or

from the lower or middle Pliocene of Maragha Persia 152SCHWARZEUROPEAN FOSSIL HORSES by Pomel Ph Thomas Boule and other French authors and are in part from late Pleistocene deposits There is however no doubt that everything found in continental Europe and especially in England is not more recent than early Pleistocene about corresponding to the first Interglacial of Penck The modern Arab thoroughbred shows all the main characters of this type which have been pointed out above in addition it possesses only five lumbar vertebrae a feature not hitherto corroborated in fossil material the available skeletons being of a very fragmentary nature But there is ample reason to believe from the facts known that it is from this type that the Arab Barb and the highbred Orien tal races have been developed Since it has been shown that E sivalensis is distinct it becomes highly probable that the thoroughbred races have been bred from the North African race of Equus stenonis which in a wild state survived up to the human period The second type which should be known as Equus caballusl7 includ ing a very great number of names the exact status of which is not yet determinable first appears in the Pliocene Red Crag of England and the upper upper Pliocene deposits of the Sivalik Hills and is still found in a wild state in Mongolia From the oldest to more recent forms a gradual decrease in size seems to exist which leads from the large tooth from the Red Crag figured by Owen as E plicidens and the coarse limb bones mentioned by Lydekker8 as belonging to a very large species to the small lightlimbed horses of late palaeolithic and neolithic times and Przewalskis horse of Mongolia It would appear that this evolution has not taken place in a continuous series in at least those parts of western Europe which underwent glaciation had their fauna destroyed by the ice and only in interglacial and post glacial times regenerated from districts where it had been preserved This assumption would explain the gaps between the large preglacial E c plicidens the middle sized second stage E c robustus and the small third stage of the E c spelaeusprzewalskii type At present only in one casel9 have transitional stages been described and these 17 Fixed by Ewart Trans Highl Agric Soc Scotland 5 XVI p 264 on the Norwegian Fjordhest I cannot agree with Stejneger Smith Misc Coll XLVIII p 470

89 1886 from the Norwich Crag 19 Soergel ic from Steinheim ad Murv Wiirttemberg 153JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY are from an area which has remained free from ice during the whole Pleistocene This gradual evolution may be observed in another important character in the older forms the protocone of the cheek teeth is somewhat detached from the main body of the tooth and becomes more adpressed in more recent ones the anterior lobe of the protocone is on the whole rather long and has been described as very characteristic of E c przewalskii by Lydekker20 it appears to be constantly so in the living and the more recent fossil forms but in teeth which have been described from the lower Pleistocene of central Europe it is sometimes much smaller than the posterior lobe from which it is generally clearly separated though this is far from being constant even in teeth from the same locality The oldest tooth known Bawdsey is almost in distinguishable in this particular character from the most recent types It is this type with a rather heavy head and six lumbar vertebrae that has transmitted its principal characters to modern heavy races such as the Pinzgauer and Belgian draught horses Their far superior size compared to that of the wild tarpan is most certainly the product of conscious breeding for certain purposes which has taken place in historical times and even within a rather short period It has frequently been supposed that the most heavy types are derived from the middle sized horse of the robustus type but this is impossible as that form had long ceased to exist at the time when horses were first domesticated On the contrary all the available evidence afforded by fossil and prehistoric remains points to the fact that the most an cient domestic horses were of a type closely resembling the wild tarpan of Mongolia in their rather light build and somewhat clumsy head Professor Ewart believed that the Celtic pony is of another type than the tarpan It has been already shown by Lydekker2 that the skull characters adduced by him are not very reliable and it has also been shown above that slender limbs are found in E stenonis as well as in the more recent forms of the caballus type It would further appear probable that the presence of only five lumbar vertebrae in some of the skeletons examined by Professor Ewart is due to infusion of southern blood22 I have ascertained23 that the Lofoten pony pre served in the Bergen Museum and regarded as of pure Celtic origin 20 Guide to the specimens of the Horse family p 14 fig 16A 1907 21 Guide p 15 22 Ridgeway The Origin and Influence of the Thoroughbred Horse pp 419420 1905 and Lydekker The Horse and its relatives p 121 1912 23 With the kind help of Professor Brinkmann 154SCHWARZEUROPEAN FOSSIL HORSES both by him and all those who have examined it has six lumbar verte brae I should think that the original Celtic pony was of northern blood and that the southern characters presented by a number of the present ponies are entirely due to mixture with horses imported from the Mediterranean region within historic times The remarkable fact that in Europe alone both species of horse were found together will be understood by the following zo6geographical deductions In the later Tertiary Europe had a land connection with North Africa as well as western Asia immigration being possible both from the East and South Thus Equus stenonis reached Europe from northern Africa as a representative of the western or Mediterranean Equus caballus from central Asia with the eastern or Asiatic component of the Pliocene steppe fauna During the Glacial Period the greater part of both faunse disappeared from central Europe But when the ice had made its retreat the Mediterranean landbridge was no longer in existence and reimmigration was possible only from the East In postglacial times Equus cabatlus ranged again all over northern and central Asia and the greater part of Europe and has given rise through its various geographical subspecies to the primitive domestic races of Russia and Asia and the heavy draught horses of western Europe Equus stenonis however was held back in northern Africa where it has become the ancestor of the thoroughbred stock of Barbs and Arabs24 Frankfort a M Germany 24 It is interesting to note here that a tooth from Wadi Halfa Nubia described by Lydekker Quart Journ Geol Soc XLIII pp 16163 1887 as nearly re lated to E sivalensis appears to me quite different If conclusions may be drawn from a single specimen it seems to approach E quagga more than any thing else 155

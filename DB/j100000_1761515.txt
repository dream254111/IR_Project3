took up the carmine the epithelium of the ciliated chambers soon ejected the granules while the cells of the upper surface of the subdermal cavity gave them off to the amoeboid wandering cells of the mesoderm which after they had partly digested the carmine transmitted it to the cells of the ciliated chambers for ejection He con cluded therefore that although all the cells had the power of absorption as is the case in man still the digestive function in the species upon which he ex perimented was centralized in the upper wall of the subdermal cavities Other authors have held differ ent views and in a subsequent paper he himself has concluded that it cannot yet be decided whether sponges digest with the ectoderm or the entoderm though he considers it not improbable that both layers may have that function His papers will be found in the Proceedings of the Linnean society of New South Wales R von Lendenfeld has also described in the Annals and magazine of natural history for December 1884 a new variety of Medusa which mnay prove to be a new species evolved within the last forty years The species is Crambessa mosaica which Huxley in 1845 described from Sydney Australia as blue to gray but which is now found in this locality distinctly brown in color due to a parasitic alga which infests the flesh near the surface The evidence is sufficient to cause von Lendenfeld to state that it is probable that this new variety has been born since Huxley described it in 1845 He also mentions the case of another Medusa Cyanea annaskala which has hitherto been found only at Port Philip where it is abundant but which has recently been found at Port Jackson in warmer water Those in the latter place differ from the typical species in being much larger and besides in possessing deeppurple pigmentcells around the moutharms which he thinks may be able to perceive light He makes a new variety from this variation of color THE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE BRAIN IN THEIR RELATION TO MENTAL DISORDERS TREATISES upon insanity have been appear ing recently in quick succession both in this country and abroad There is none however which will command more notice and prove more suggestive than this work Professor Meynert who has been at the head of the department of psychiatry in the Univer sity of Vienna for the past fifteen years was one of the first to advance the opinion that a study of mental disease must be preceded by an understanding of healthy mental action Regarding mental action as the subjective side Psychiatrie Klinik der erkrankungen des vorderhirns be griindet auf dessen bate leistungen und erndhrung Von Dr THEODOR MEYNERT Erste halfte Wien Braumiiller 1884 10 288 p illustr 8 VOL V No 112 of a physiological process in the brain he seeks primarily to ascertain the function of the organ from its anatomical structure The logi cal order which is followed in this work is therefore first the anatomy of the brain sec ond the physiology of the brain that is the mechanism of mind and lastly disturbances of the mechanism that is mental disorder The first volume is devoted to the structure and functions of the organ of mind The po sition which Professor Meynert holds as the founder of modern brainanatomy entitles him to a respectful hearing on this subject Since the appearance of his first articles in Strickers Handbook of histology in 1870 he has been the chief authority in Germany and almost every one of the younger scientific men who have done original work in this department has been imbued with his enthusiasm by personal contact with him in his laboratory Within a hundred and twentyfive pages he has succeeded in giving a clear statement of the complex subject of the arrangement and relations of the gray masses and white connectingfibres which make up the brain An important aid to the comprehension of the structure will be found in the numerous excellent drawings of dissections and of microscopic sections The gray matter of the nervous system is the part in which sensory impulses are received and registered and in which motor impulses are initiated The white matter is made up of threads which transmit the impulses without modifying them The structure and functions of the gray matter differ in different parts simple functions being performed by that in the spinal cord more complex functions in the gray masses within the brain the most complex and the conscious functions being assigned to the layer which is spread out upon the surface of the brain and which is thrown into folds by its convolutions Each part of the surface of the body is in anatomical connection by means of nervefibres with its own part of the surface of the brain and thus it is not difficult to im agine a projection of a map of the body upon the braincortex The fibres which act in this manner to bring the external world into con sciousness are named by Meynert the pro jection system of tracts This  projection system  was announced in 1870 and was the startingpoint to which all the recent discov eries regarding the localization of functions in various regions of the brain can be traced It is today the groundwork for many arguments in favor of the theory of localization a the orv to which Meynert gives his hearty support At present investigations in brainanatomyMARCH 27 1885 SCIE are directed to tracing the course of the tracts which unite the gray masses and form the parts of the projection system Owing to the discovery of new methods of investigation progress has been rapid of late It is not to be wondered at therefore that in regard to some details the statements of Meynert which were already in print three years ago cannot now be accepted eg as to the course of the lemniscus pp 9497 and the connection of the tracts in the spinal cord with those in the cerebral axis pp 120125 The diagram fig 58 is especially misleading It is proba bly on account of these errors that an appendix is promised to appear with the second volume and to contain a review of the more recent dis coveries These minor defects do not however impair the usefulness of the work as a general textbook of brainanatomy and it is a matter of congratulation to those who are unable to master the very difficult style of the author that an English translation is soon to appear It is by means of the projection system that impulses from without reach the braincortex and become conscious perceptions To asso ciate these perceptions and make connected thought possible there exists a second system of fibres which unites the various regions of the brainsurface with each other This is the  association system Meynert illustrates the action of these systems by analyzing the sim ple act of winking If a pin touches the eye of an infant the lid closes This is a reflex act carried out by a simple mechanism inde pendent of any act of consciousness but coincident with the reflex act a number of im pulses are sent along the projection fibres to the brain which on reaching the cortex give rise to the conscious perception of the appear ance of the pin of the pain of the prick and of the motion which has been performed Each of these perceptions occurs in a different part of the brain since each impulse reaches it by a different fibre But the three occur simulta neously and as all parts of the cortex are joined by association fibres the three percep tions are associated both in perception and in memory Hence when the pin is seen again the memory of the pain arises and also the mem ory of the motion which stopped the pain and thus the mere sight of the object may lead the child to close the eye The perception of the reflex motion has given the infant the knowl edge of the possession of a muscle which will move and the motion having once become conscious can be reproduced voluntarily by an effort which excites to action those cells which retain the memory of the motion pp 144148 TNCE 259 Every perception and motion has its appropri ate cell and lest this should seem to demand too great a number of cells Meynert has exam ined the cortex microscopically and has found that it contains over a milliard of these bodies p 140 Each physiological action is at tended by the acquisition of a new memory and as we go on in life the number of cells un occupied becomes less and less so that it is probable that a physical limit to the power of memory and consequently to the power of in tellectual growth is determined by the number of cells in the cortex p 140 This is the standpoint of an extreme materialist But Meynerts materialism is not of the theoretical kind it is based upon facts of observation which cannot be ignored The structure of the brain its comparative development in various species the evolution of mind in animals the growth of knowledge in children the results of experi mental physiology and the symptoms of men tal dissolution in a class of cases in which disease has reduced the individual to the level of the infant or even to that of the brute have been called on to furnish the data for Mey nerts mechanism of thought Psychologists are slowly coming to the conclusion that a wholly subjective method of research is inade quate to settle the questions which for so many years they have been unable to answer and are beginning to pursue an objective method by studying the development of mind and the disorders of mind which are associated with actual loss of brainsubstance To psycholo gists therefore this book is of great impor tance for it opens up many new subjects it throws light on many obscure subjects it set tles finally some disputed subjects Physiological processes are attended by the consumption of material hence the nutrition of the brain enters as a factor in mental action When a part of the brain is exercised more blood passes to that part than to other parts to supply oxygen as it is needed The rapidity and quality of the mental process is dependent to some degree upon the proper bloodsupply These are facts determined by experiment on animals and man Mental labor is attended with a rise of temperature in the brain an in dication of increased oxidation processes If a dogs brain is laid bare the vessels are seen to be less distended with blood during sleep than when it is awake If the dog dreams the vessels dilate An abnormal flow of blood to the brain interferes with the natural action of the organ it may cause an irritation of the cells containing memory pictures and con sequently a conscious perception of the object260 SCIE remembered by the cells ie hallucinations So too an abnormal lack of blood may ex haust the brain may render a person incapable of carrying on mental processes and may even cause such a degree of hunger for oxygen in the cells as in turn to produce irritation and thus again hallucinations followed by loss of memory It is evident that Meynert regards many forms of mental disease as dependent upon abnormal nutrition of the brain either from hyperaemia or anaemia a position in which he by no means stands alone The description of physiological processes in the brain forms a fitting introduction to the study of its disorders This division of the subject is to be taken ulp in the second volume which will be eagerly looked for by those who have read the first It will doubtless be as suggestive and original as this volume Meynerts book should be read both by medical men and those interested in the prob lems of psychology Its technical parts will be of great service to those who study the minute anatomy of the brain Its physiological portion is of general interest and will excite much notice and comment The facts and the conclusions are entitled to careful con sideration as they are the product of most mature and thorough work even though the materialistic explanation is at times inade quate Meynert is not to be placed in the ranks of German philosophers He does not grapple with the problems of psychology as Lotze or Wiindt have done he writes from the standpoint of an alienist who seeks to resolve a mental process into its simplest elements and to detect in any given case of mental dis order the particular element which is lacking The explanation of the manner in which we acquire the idea of space is unsatisfactory p 166 The causal relation is not sharply differentiated from the simple association of ideas by correlation in time p 164 The time element in memory is not exhaustively discussed There are doubtless many trains of thought which are largely the simple rising into consciousness of associated memory pic tures There are others which are not to be so easily accounted for and to which no clew can be gained by a study of association fibres and of variations in the bloodsupply To the psychologist therefore this work will be of service only as a collection of facts in one department bearing upon his science facts which he must consider but which by no means carry with them the explanation of the problems involved The work raises many questions which the NCE VOL V No 112 author does not attempt to answer It would perhaps be unjust to demand from him the attempt for he does not pretend to be writino as a psychologist As a study of thought mechanism and as an introduction to a study of psychiatry to which alone it lays claims it is more satisfactory than any work which has recently appeared ENGINEERING GEOLOGY IT is now generally admitted by mining and civil engineers that a knowledge of the princi ples of practical geology is necessary for the successful execution of those plans depending upon a correct conception and understanding of the character of the surface of the earth and underlying rocks where engineering works such as bridges railroads canals and even buildings are to be constructed and through which as in the case of railroadtunnels and mines excavations are to be made The rapid progress which has been made in America during the past fifteen years in prac tical geology has so completely absorbed the active professionalist that none of our field geologists have found time to contribute a treatise to our literature such as Geikies Field Pennings Engineering and Pages EcoInomic geology Burats  Geologie applique and the more recent work by Wagner on I The relation of geology to the engineering sciences This last work is an elaborate and strictly technical discussion of the application of prac tical geology to tunnelwork and closely relat ed subjects It contains superior plate quarto photolithographs and text illustrations and will prove a work of great value not only to professional fieldgeologists but to students in practical geology and engineering in defin ing some of the more useful and economically important applications of geology to engineer ing work Some of the geological crosssections in the text clearly illustrate the geotectonic principles referred to but evidently perpetuate an abom inable custom long since abandoned by the best Ameriican geologists of exaggerating the vertical scale The chapter on explorations by boring is not up to the standard of our home practice The practical examples cited from Wagners own experience add much value and interest to the work which would be more useful to Die beziehungen

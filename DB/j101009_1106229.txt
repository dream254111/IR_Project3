of his worthy labors for his profession and his city he has fallen He passed away at his home in St Louis Wednesday January 4th Though bnly fortysix years of age he had made a record of service as a lawyer and citizen which would do honor to any man He graduated in law at Washington University in 1898 and im mediately entered the law office of Judge J G Woerner In 1900 he became editor of the Central Law Journal which position he held until his death What his rare worth as editor has been all readers of the Journal know He gave to this work the best of his broad scholarship abundant energy and wholesome progressive spirit He has moreover kept the columns of the Journal open to the discussion of matters of interest to the Bar and particularly to the American Bar Association of which he was an active and loyal member He was the author of American Advocacy published in 1904 and a work on Conflict of Laws published in 1914 For many years he was lecturer on the Law of Real Property and Conflict of Laws in St Louis University Institute of Law To the American Bar Association there was none more loyal and few if any more useful In 1917 he was appointed by Governor Gardner as one of the members of the Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws which works in harmony with the American Bar Association In 1920 he was chairman of the Committee on Publicity and in 1921 chairman of the Committee on Arbitration of this Conference He was chairman of the Committee on Uniform State Laws of the Missouri Bar Association and gave much time and thought to this subject The Uniform Bills of Lading Act and the Uniform Ware house Act came in for his attention He also appeared before the legislature at recent sessions to urge the passage of the Uniform Sales Act In both the American and State Bar Associations and through the Journal he has been an untiring advocate of the reform of judicial procedure In this work he was a friend and ally of Mr Thomas W Shelton of Norfolk Virginia Chairman of the American Bar Associ ation Committee on Uniform Judicial Procedure Mr Shelton speaks in but modest terms when he wires The Bar the state society and journalism have lost a noble fearless and unselfish member at the height of his intelligent usefulness As a lawyer and as a citizen he was a progressive Both in his profession and as a citizen he had the courage and vision of the reformer combined with the practical sense of the advocate and 1922  789 MISCELLANY7 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S statesman In his work as a lawyer whether in the courts at the editors desk in the lecture room of the schools or in bar associa tions he sought to make straight and easy the paths that should lead to equal and exact justice As a citizen he has always stood for what he conceived to be just and right regardless of popular fancy or favor Many just but un opular causes have found in him an able and dauntless advocate In 1921 Governor Hyde appointed him a member of the Board of Election Commissioners of the city of St Louis which position he held at the time of his death To the boards work he was giving the very best of his ripe judgment practical sense and patriotic devotion Mr John B Edwards Chairman of the Board of Election Com missioners says of his work as a member of the board During practically the entire year of 1921 Mr Robbins served as Secretary of the St Louis Election Board To this work he un stintingly gave his time and energy In the various legal questions which arose he took a lively interest investigated the law and con tributed much toward their solution He was well grounded in the law careful in his decisions judicious in his suggestions of policies to be adopted and possessed of a large fund of common sense He gave himself wholeheartedly to an effort to secure for the city clean elections He helped formulate laws which seemed to be necessary for enactment and gladly responded to all requests for service His untiring effort to select good men for judges and clerks must have contributed somewhat to the cause of his illness In his shirt sleeves he worked day after day interviewing citizens who were being examined as to their qualifications for judges and clerks and in mak ing selections of those who are to serve from those so examined Up to the night of his illness he was at the boards office from morn ing until night working faithfully earnestly and prompted by a keen desire to do his best By those who worked with him in this position he will be greatly missed It almost seems as if the place cannot be filled by another so well equipped to render the service Amid all of his activities as a lawyer and as a citizen he was a loyal and active worker in his church Indeed he was one of the citys finest examples of the educated Christian in professional and civic lifeCHARLES M HAY in Central Lawc Journal Inventor May Keep His SecretIn proceedings supplementary to execution in the New York Supreme Court at Special Term for Kings County the examination of the judgment debtor showed that he claimed to have invented a device for sound production for use on phonographs and that he had made some models of the device He had neither applied for a patent nor given his ideas to the public Whether he should be compelled to answer questions which would 790  FebMISCELLANY reveal the nature of the invention was the interesting question the court had to decide If the subjectmatter of the ideas constituted property rights he would have to answer otherwise not Judge Cropsey wrote the opinion which is published under the title of Rosenthal v Goldstein 183 New York Supplement 582 After discussing the law relating to the rights of inventors generally in respect to their inventions the opinion closes with the following statement The right of the inventor to guard and preserve his secret is as well established as is his right to secure from the government a monopoly by disclosing his secret And section 8957 Barnes Fed Code U S Comp St  9453 provides that no witness shall be guilty of a contempt for refusing to disclose any secret invention or discovery made or owned by himself This may well be a statutory declaration of the inviolability of the commonlaw right of the in ventor to preserve his secret It clearly seems opposed to the con tention that he may be compelledto file an application and so reveal his secret This provision is in harmony with the result arrived at namely that the right of an inventor before he has disclosed his se cret is not property in the general sense of the word The judgment debtor need not answer the question to which ob jections have been made Secretary of State Must Submit Proposed Constitutional Amend mentInitiatory petitions properly signed pursuant to the state constitution were filed in the office of the Secretary of State propos ing an amendment to the state Constitution He upon being advised by the Attorney General that the proposed amendment was uncon stitutional as in conflict with the Constitution of the United States and should not be submitted to the electors at the fall election re fused to submit it Mandamus proceedings were instituted in the Michigan Supreme Court to compel its submission and the writ was granted in Hamilton v Vaughan 179 Northwestern Reporter 553 Chief Justice Moore wrote the opinion in which he said If the respondent in this case may decide whether the proposed amendment is constitutional and thus refuse to submit it may he not in any case in which it is his judgment that the proposed amend ment is unconstitutional decline to submit it If he may exercise this power is not he going much farther than his duties as a ministerial officer authorize him to go If the proposed amendment should re ceive a majority of the legal votes cast there will then be time enough to inquire whether any provision of the federal Constitution has been violated Until that time comes we must decline to express any opinion as to the unconstitutionality of the proposed amendment 1922  791792 7 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S  Feb Immunity of State Executive from ArrestOn July 20 1921 the grand jury of Sangamon County Illinois returned an indictment against Len Small governor of the state charging him with embezzle ment of public funds during a previous term as State Treasurer Counsel for Governor Small appearing as amici curiae urged that the governor was immune from arrest during his term of office and sought to have the clerk of the court restrained from issuing a capias The court decided that there was no such immunity and or dered the clerk to issue process and the sheriff to make the arrest unless the governor voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of the court1 The question of whether the chief executive of a state may be ar arrested on a criminal charge during his term of office has iiever been directly decided2 Nor is any express provision as to the question to be found in the constitution or statutes of Illinois Certain officers are specifically exempted from arrest under certain circumstances3 but there is no such provision regarding the governor He is made liable to impeachment4 but this does not exclude the possibility of criminal prosecution5 People v Small Ill Circ Ct 7th Jud Circ E S Smith J de cided July 27 1921 The opinion may be found in the Chicago Tribune for July 28 1921 The governor refused to submit vol untarily to the jurisdiction of the court and was arrested He was released on bond and the case is now awaiting trial after a change

REV STATS 107  9 In none of these cases does the immunity extend to cases of felony or breach of the peace This in itself disposes of the argument that in the principal case the governor should be considered a mem ber of the legislature on account of his veto power and hence exempt See ILL CONST Art V  15 5Ibid Art IV  24 The party impeached whether convicted or acquitted shall nevertheless be liable to prosecution trial judg ment and punishment according to law In the Constitutional Con vention an attempt was made to amend this section so far as it ap plied to the governor by adding the words after the expiration of his term of office but this was debated and rejected See 1 DEBATES AND PROCEEDINGS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION OF 186970 792 This indicates that the framers of the constitution did not intend the governor should be exempt from arrest during his term of office Nor can it be said that impeachment is a condition precedent to trial If this were so every subordinate official constitutionally liable to1922  MISCELLANY 793 The ordinary rule of the common law is that an official is not exempt from liability for his unlawful acts while in office6 even when he pre sumes to act as an official but acts ultra vires7 The general policy is that all men are equal before the law A fortiori election to a public office does not in the ordinary case carry with it immunity from prosecution for crime committed before election But there are certain exceptions to these general principles Where the official is a personal sovereign such as the King of England or the personal representative of such a sovereign8 he is immune from all process civil or criminal It can hardly be contended that the governors of the several states come within this category Another exception exists where the suit against the official is in substance a suit against the state9 which is clearly not the case here Should there be a further exception in the case of the governor of a state qua governor One argument in support of the exemption is that the courts can not enforce the arrest of the chief executive10 It is said that the ulti mate sanction of the courts process is the military power of the state which is under the control of the governor and hence it will be vain for the court to attempt his arrest But as has been forcibly pointed out1i it must be presumed that the governor will obey the law and will not call out the militia to prevent its enforcement That he may act unlawfully is no reason why the court should refuse to enforce the law so far as it is able12 and where as in the present case the offense was one committed be fore election to office trial would be impossible while the offender held office 6 Burton v United States 202 U S 344 1906 Williamson

to enforce obedience and not for constitutional reasons  See Ekern v McGovern 154 Wis 157 142 N V 595 1913 See also Ballantine Is a Governor Privileged by his Office from Arrest and Prosecution for Crime 93 CENT L J 111 2 A variant of this argument is one based on the pardoning power It is said that although the governor is convicted he will remain governor and can pardon himself and hence the courts action will be nugatory Even if this were true which may will be doubted794 7 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S  Feb It is also urged that the constitutional principle of the separation of powers 13 prevents the courts from in any way coercing or restraining the chief executive14 On this ground it is held by a majority of the states that the governor is not subject to mandamus even as to acts purely ministerial15 and this is the settled rule in Illinois1 The rule as to injunction is generally said to be the same17 though it is significant that the Supreme Court of Illinois has considered on the merits two bills for an injunction against the governor18 But the re fusal of the courts to control the chief executives official acts by mandamus or injunction is not conclusive of the present case There the court is controlling an official act here it is enforcing the law against a person whose wrongful act has no connection with his official position Moreover though the arrest of the governor may indirectly interfere with his official acts19 the principle of the separa tion of powers is not thereby violated The effect of that principle is to forbid any department of the government to exercise the power such a pardon would not completely wipe out the effects of the con viction Under the constitution of the state the misappropriation of public money without more makes the wrongdoer ineligible to pub lic office See ILL CONST Art IV  4 The conviction would es tablish this though there were a later pardon See Williston Does a Pardon Blot Out the Offense 28 HARV L REx 657  This principle is expressly embodied in the constitution of Illinois See ILL CONST Art III 4 This is the principal argument urged in a recent article dealing with the principal case See Gillespie A Governor cannot be Law fully Arrested or Put upon Trial while in Office 93 CENT L J 149 Mr Gillespie was of counsel for Governor Small See MERRILL IANDAMUS  9296 The prevailing view is that mandamus will not issue even where the act is purely ministerial But a few courts allow it in such cases McCauley 7 Brooks 16 Cal 11 1860 Cotton v Ellis 7 Jones L N C 545 1860 18 People ex rel Billings v

prevailing view on the ground that in them the governor did not object to the jurisdiction It has been held in Illinois that if the governor submits to the jurisdiction the court may direct a mandamus to him People ex rel Stickney v Palmer 64 Ill 11 1872 But if the court has no constitutional power to act it would seem that the fact of the governors failure to object to the jurisdiction should be

to another except within more or less elastic limits20 It is a rule of separation of function not of special privileges and im munities It may well be that when a court by mandamus or injunc tion controls the performance of an official act it is exercising execu tive power but this is certainly not the case when the executive is arrested although his performance of his official duties may be ham pered thereby Nor is such indirect interference forbidden by a con stitutional principle that no department of the government is to hamper any other in the performance of its duties It is claimed by some that there is such a principle which rests on the practical necessities of government21 But it is very doubtful whether an ex ception to the commonlaw denial of official immunity can be sup ported on this basis22 How much less then can a constitutional exemption fixing an immutable rule which even the legislature can not alter be implied in the absence of any constitutional provision even remotely bearing on the point23 The most forcible argument in favor of executive immunity is the practical one It is said that public policy demands that the governor be free to devote all his time to his official duties unhampered by liability to stand trial in the criminal courts24 It must be admitted See 1 STORY COMMENTARIES ON THE CONSTITUTION 3 ed  525 See also Greenwood Cemetery Land Co v Routh 17 Colo 156 163 28 Pac 1125 1127 1892 Cf THE FEDERALIST No 42 The doctrine of the separation of powers does not prevent the courts from taking jurisdiction in quo zwarranto to determine who

Pac 162 165 1888 There is no express provision in the constitution nor in any statute exempting any member of the executive department chief or other wise from being sued in any action    civil or criminal    or from being liable to any process or writ properly issued by any court    and if any one of such officers is exempt    it must be because of some hidden or occult implications in the constitution or statutes or from some inherent and insuperable barriers founded on the structure of the government itself    Ordinarily constitutional limitations must be traceable to express provisions here there are none while the traditional common law as to official immunity is the other way See COOLEY CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS 6 ed 201 An express provision is especially needed when dealing with the executive department since the constitution of Illinois is construed as a grant to the executive and judiciary and a limitation on the legislature so that any residuary powers are in

and that it has apparently prevailed in some cases where it was sought to compel the governor to testify as a witness25 But the alleged testimonial immunity of the chief executive had been severely criticized26 and it may well be doubted whether it exists27 Even if it does it is submitted that the public policy that crime shall be punished according to law is weightier than that which requires all competent witnesses to testify Further in the subpoena cases there was no positive statute to be construed away28 In dealing with the practical argument little is to be gained by imagining possible extreme cases It is not enough to show that the governor might conceivably be kept so busy answering vexatious criminal charges that the state government would be virtually with out a head29 nor to point out on the other hand that a governor immune from arrest might conceivably commit crimes with impunity If such situations arise they will be met by extralegal action The real question is whether executive immunity from arrest is of sufficient practical necessity to require a departure from the traditional Anglo American principle of equality before the law and to justify reading an exception into criminal statutes in their terms absolute30 To give an elected governor the personal immunity of an hereditary king is so contrary to the spirit of American institutions that a greater practical necessity than exists in this case should be required in order to reach that result31 2 See Thompson v Railroad Co 22 N J Eq 111 1871 Appeal of Hartranft 85 Pa St 433 1877 But see note 24

follow is shown by experience in England The prime minister and other cabinet members are of course liable to arrest and to civil process See King v Lords Commissioners of the Treasury 5 N  M 589 1835 Ellis v Earl Grey 6 Sim 214 1833 Yet we do not hear of the English government being hampered by continual vexatious criminal prosecutions against the prime minister 80 The procedure following the return of an indictment is entirely regulated by statute See 1913 HURDS REV STATS 877  414420 It is provided that the judge shall fix the amount of bail  414 that the clerk of court shall issue process of capias  415 and that the sheriff shall make the arrest  417 None of these officials are given any discretion in the matter 81 It may be argued that no one could take the governors place in case he is convicted The constitution provides for the conduct of the government in case of death conviction on impeachment failure1922  MISCELLANY 797 Judicial readiness to resist the executive prerogative when carried beyond its legal limits has been one of the glories of the commonlaw tradition Bacon to the contrary notwithstanding the judges have not been lions under the throne The action of the Illinois court in this case in the face of a threat by the governor to call out the militia to resist arrest is reminiscent of Cokes sturdy resistance to James I in the famous Case of the Prohibitions32Harvard Law Review Automobile Salesman Shot by Sheriffs PosseAn automobile salesman whose duty required him to visit local dealers and help them organize their territory and secure subdealers therein called upon a dealer and introduced himself After some conversation he was invited by the dealer to go automobile riding and together with two other persons the party started out They first towed in a dis abled car and then took the road towards another town On the trip the dealer who was driving showed signs of mental derangement but not to an extent to cause the others in the automobile to interfere with his driving even when going at high speed A sheriff who had been informed that a large car had been stolen learned of the dealers peculiar actions on the road and believing it to be the stolen car he telephoned one of his deputies to summon aid and intercept the car The deputy secured a number of armed men and stationed them along the road and when the dealers car which was being driven at high speed and with the muffler open failed to stop on command some of the posse opened fire in an attempt to stop the car by hitting the tires as they had been instructed to do The agent who was sitting on the front seat with the dealer was struck by a bullet and killed The agents minor children were awarded compensation under the Workmens Compensation Act and the Supreme Court of Minnesota affirmed the judgment in Wold v Chevrolet Motor Co 179 North western Reporter 219 Judge Holt wrote the opinion in which it was held that the evidence sustained findings that the injury was accidental and that it arose out of and in the course of the agents employment to qualify resignation absence from the state or other disability of the governor See ILL

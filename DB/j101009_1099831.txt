Virginia 1887 The con struction placed upon these statutes must hereafter be left entirely to the trial courts as the Court of Appeals will grant no more writs of error in cases arising under them Western Union Telegraph Company v Reynolds 8 Va Law Register 371 This leaves many doubtful questions of construction to be decided which questions it is hoped the General Assembly will remove by appropriate legisla tion It has been contended on behalf of the telegraph companies that there can be no recovery under section 1291 for mere negligencethat bad faith and partiality must be proven Judge Wellford of the Circuit Court of Richmond has decided in the case of Maury  Co v Western Union Telegraph Company in a written opinion delivered by him that the statute requires proof not only of the failure to transmit the dispatch faithfully but also failure to transmit it im partially Under this construction recoveries under section 1291 would be ex ceedingly rare if not impossible We understand however that other judges have taken a different view The early Virginia statutes as to telegraphic serv ice will be found in Acts of Assembly 18467 p 80 Acts 1852 p 122 The annotations to the statutes following are extracts from Mr Pollards forth coming Annotated Code of Virginia SEC 1291 Receipt and transmission of dispatcheIt shall be the duity of every telegraph or telephone company doing business in this State to receive dispatches from and for other telegraph or telephone companies or lines and from and for any person and upon the payment of the usual charges therefor according to the regulations of the company to transmit the same faithfully and impartially and as promptly as practicable and in the order of delivery to the said com pany For every failure to transmit a dispatch faithfully and impartially and for every failure to transmit a dispatch as promptly as practicable or in the order of its delivery to the company the company shall forfeit the sum of one hundred dollars to the person sending or wishing to send such dispatch But nothing herein shall prevent any such company from giving preference to dis patches on official business from or to officers of the United States or the State of Virginia or from making arrangements with proprietors or publishers of newspapers for the transmission to them for publication of intelligence of general and public interest out of its regular order 18656 p 218 In an action against a telegraph company the line of which extends through several States though it appears that some of the defendants live out of the State this is not cause for arresting the judgment against the company If it is good ground for objection to the jurisdiction of the State court it must be taken by plea in abatement before the defendants plead in bar Wash  New Orleans Tel Co v Hobson  Son 15 Gratt 122 Telegraph comanies are not public carriers in the strict sense of the term yet on account of the public nature of their employment they have in many cases been held to a similar responsibility W U Tel Co v Reynolds 77 Va 17366 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER May The regulations of the company must be reasonable They cannot relieve themselves from liability for the improper or negligent conduct of its employees or the defective character of their instruments Id This section applies to cipher messages as well as intelligible mes sages Id In order to recover more than nominal damages it is not necessary that the company have knowledge of the plaintiffs liability to loss by reason of its failure to transmit promptly and correctly Id Manager of StrawBoard Association telegraphed a member that the price of straw board had been advanced and a few hours later that old price had been restored About midnight of same day telegraph company by mistake sent him a copy of first telegram marked Dup Held Member was entitled to presume the last telegram to be an original dispatch and his failure to detect it as a duplicate was not such want of ordinary care as prevented him from re covering damages for losses resulting from the mistake W U Tel Co v Va Paper Co 87 Va 418 This being a penal statute in suits thereunder the declaration is fatally defec tive unless it clearly states all the circumstances necessary to support the action W U Tel Co v Powell 94 Va 268 Under section 2900 as amended Acts 19012 p 385 damages for violation of this statute as well as for the penalty imposed in this or the following section may be recovered in a single action of trespass on the case Telegraph companies cannot rely on endorsements made on message blanks to restrict their liability when plaintiff never signed the blank nor authorized any one to do so for him Id Writ of error dismissed because the constitutionality of this and following section had been passed upon W U Tel Co v Goddin 94 Va 513 W U Tel Co v Reynolds 41 S E Va 856 Not yet officially reported Where the initial and terminal points are both in the same State and the tele gram is transmitted over the wires of the same company and concerns only citizens of that State the message is a domestic message and its character in that respect is not altered by the circumstance that the line passes in part over the territory of another State Nor is it affected by the fact that the company has established a relay office in such other State The statute deals with the company not its agents W U Td Co v Reynolds 41 S E Va 856 Not yet officially reported Under a somewhat similar statute the Supreme Court of Georgia has decided that prepaynment or tender is condition precedent to the enforcement of the penalty Langley v W U Tel Co 15 S E Ga 291 Agent not bound to know hour of closing terminal office See note 7 Va L R 728 For

it is to be transmitted to cause the same to be forwarded by a messenger to the person to whom the same is addressed or his agent and upon the payment of any charges due on this dispatch to deliver it provided such person or agent reside within the city or incorporated town in which such station is or that at such point the regulations of the company require such delivery It shall also be the duty of such company to forward a dispatch promptly as directed where the same is to be forwarded For every failure to deliver or forward a dispatch as promptly as practicable the company shall forfeit one hundred dollars to the person sending the dispatch or the person to whom it was addressed 118656 p 218 as amended 18991900 p 996 The penalty prescribed is a fine and a justice has no jurisdiction to recover the same as it exceeds 20 Code sec 2939 W U Tel Co v Pettyjohn 88 Va 296 Does not conflict with the Interstate Commerce clause of the United States Constitution W U Tel Co v Tyler 90 Va 297

Act 18991900 p 724 Gonnelly v W ET Tel Co 7 Va L R p 704 Not yet officially reported Although telegraph company may violate this section it was not intended by section 2900 allowing damages for

the transmission of a telegram is made in a state the laws of which do not allow damages for mental anguish for its breach is held in Gray v West U Tel Co Tenn 56 L R A 301 not to prevent a recovery of such damages for neglecting to deliver it promptly in a state whose statutes make such neglect a public offense subjecting the offender to liability for the injuries thereby caused and whose courts permit the consideration of mental anguish in fixing the damages A note to this case collects the authorities on conflict of laws as to measure of damages See 8 Virginia Law Register 379 See also in this general connec tion the case of Bright v W U Tel Co N C April 1903 43 S E 841 We are glad to note that Virginia is now among those States of the Union which have taken steps for the promotion of uniform legislation in the United States An Act approved March 28 1903 reads as follows 1 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Virginia That within thirty days after the passage of this act and every two years thereafter the governor shall appoint three commissioners who are hereby constituted a board of com missioners by the name and style of commissioners for the promotion of uni formity of legislation in the United States It shall be the duty of said com missioners to examine the subjects of marriage and divorce insolvency the form of notarial certificates descent and distribution of property acknowledg ment of deeds execution and probate of wills and other subjects on which uni formity is desirable to ascertain the best means to effect uniformity in the laws of the States and to represent the State of Virginia in conventions of like com missioners heretofore appointed or to be appointed by other States to consider and draft uniform laws to be submitted for approval and adoption of the several States and to devise and recommend such other course of action as shall best accomplish the purpose of this act The term of office of said commissioners shall be two years The said commi8sioners shall receive no compensation for their services but their necessary traveling expenses in effecting the object of this act not to exceed fifty dollars each per annum shall be paid out of any fund not otherwise appropriated when the account for the same has been ap proved by the governor 2 This act shall be in force from its passage In compliance with this Act Governor Montague has appointed Messrs R T Barton A A Phlegar and John Garland Pollard as the Commissioners from Virginia As to the form accuracy and prompt publication of session acts the following suggestions by Mr Robert H Whitten of the New York State Library were approved by the Conference of State Boards of Commissioners and by the National Association of State Librarians held in 19021903 MISCELLANY 69 1 Public acts should be numbered consecutively and citations should give number and section rather than page title or date 2 Arabic numerals should be used for chapter numbers in place of the anti quated and obscure roman numerals 3 For rapid reference act or chapter number should appear as part of each page heading and each section should have a side head or a marginal summary 4 Session law indexes of all States should be based on a uniform system of subject entries 5 Each volume of session laws should contain a tabulation of all changes in statutes since the last edition of revised statutes 6 For citations dates and amounts arabic numerals should as a rule be used 7 Acts should be published separately as soon as signed distributed to regular exchanges and sold at a nominal price to individuals 8 Session laws should be well bound printed on good durable paper ex changed freely for other publications and sold at a moderate price 9 All bills should be drafted or revised as to form by a permanent specially trained official 10 A uniform statutory construction law should be prepared for adoption by all the States The following presents in detail the reasons for suggestion 9 supra 9 Bill Drafting All bills should be drafted or revised as to form by a per manent specially trained official For drafting bills special technical knowledge that can be acquired only by much practice is essential Each bill must be adjusted to an existing intricate system and its object must be expressed concisely clearly and with legal pre cision It is moreover highly important for clearness and ease of construc tion that all acts passed should be alike in form Great Britain and many British colonies and provinces have official draftsmen who draw most of the bills In New York three persons are appointed by the speaker of the Assembly and the temporary president of the Senate to draft bills examine and revise proposed bills and advise as to the consistency or other effect of proposed legislation In South Carolina this work is performed by the State solicitors under direction of the attorney general and in Connecticut by a special clerk of bills In New York and South Carolina only such bills are drafted by the official draftsmen as the individual members or committees see fit to refer to them In Connecticut on the other hand every bill favorably acted on by a committee is referred before being reported to the clerk of bills who revises it as to form and returns it to the committee though the committee is not obliged to accept his amendments it is very probable that it will do so  Some single official should be made responsible for the form phraseology annotation indexing and publication of all acts passed The acts at present are cumbered with useless verbiage and are so inaccurately expressed that it is im possible to be certain as to their meaning Constant litigation is the result With the drafting and publication in charge of a permanent trained official all this could be changed and in time other reforms would follow

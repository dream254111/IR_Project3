particularly the Spars or Crystals found in the Cornish Mines called Cornish Dia monds In a Letter to Emanuel Mendez da Costa Esq F R S from the Rev Mr Wm Borlace S I R S I N C E among your Searches into Natural History you think it worth your while to be particularly inquisitive after our crystallized Spars commonly called Cornish Diamonds I will give you the best Information I can concerning them assuring myself that you will make proper Allowances for the want of such As sistances as are not to be had in my present Situa tion Read Dec 14 1749 May 3 1750 I shall consider Spar here as the Genus at the Head not only of all the Species of common Spar and In crustations of what Colour soever but of Crystals and Gems which are here understood only as finer and purer Substances of the Spar Kind 1 There 1 The Properties of Crystal assigned by a late Treatise Mr  Nat Hist of Fossils such as keeping itself unaffected by Acid Menstrua remaining unaltered in a moderate Fire and giving  Sparks of Fire by Collision whereby that Author dis tinguishes it from Spar are here reckoned rather to be accidental and classical Differences owing to a purer stony Juice less  and 5251 There are several Sorts of these sparry Productions which are carefully to be distinguishd from each other but they may all be considered first with regard to their original State or what they have been and in the next Place as to what they now are that is as to Form Size Colour Hardness Texture of Parts and Direction of their Shoots in the Mines or Quarries These Particulars separately discussed may possibly lead us to several probable Conjectures concerning the Original and most distin guishing Properties of these Bodies such as may af ford some Light to this perplexed and intricate Subject S E C T 1 That all Spar has been at one time or other in a State of Fluidity may be maintained I think with great Reason as well as supported by the Authority of some of the most eminent Naturalists 2 In some Spars are found Straws and other light Bodies and we may therefore as justly conclude them to have been once fluid as the Amber that incloses the Bee In some Stones whereon were sparry Concretions and terrene than that of the common Spar than to any essential and radical Difference in the Principia of these Bodies  There is in  all Spar more or less of Crystal Woodwards Nat Hist Fossils 158 For many Spars there are which are opaque and yet in the same hexagonal Form as Crystals whence it appears that Spar and Crystal do not differ in Substance and Nature but in Transparency Colour and different Degrees of Purity  Spars much the same with Crys  tals says Dr Plot Oxf p 98  52 And Boetius doubts not but they viz Spars are of the same Matter with Gems ib  53 2 Woodwards Catal of Foss Vol 1 p 151 and 157 No 78 alibique passim I i 2 Dr252 Dr Woodward found Fragments of Shell and Pel  of the Ova of Fishes a certain Evidence that this sparry Production was not anterior to the De luge for the Stone must have  and hardened upon the Shell before the sparry Concretion could have fixed upon the Surface of the Stone and as I apprehend the Learned are now very well satisfyd that such extraneous Fossils as are mentioned above are not the Lusus Naturae but the Exuviae of Ani mals brought where we find them by the Waters of the DelugeWhere ever any Number of the shotten Spars occur there may be seen successive Incrusta tions and Crystals fixing on other Crystals some Incrustations broken off and shewing their concave Base shaped by the Cuspis or Apex of the Diamonds on which they were once fastened which shews that there has been a Succession of separate and dis tinct Indurations  In several Places we find wavy Processes  formed in thin Plates on the perpendicu lar Sides of the Rocks by the Spars flowing down in the same Manner as one Wave succeeds another on the SeaShore to which we may add the fre quent Formation of sparry Efflorescencies Accre tions on Walls and Stalactites hanging down from the Vaults and Caverns of deserted Mines Evidences sufficient of the modern Date of such Productions That we may the easier apprehend this Truth of Spars having been once a Fluid upon which much depends it may here be observed that something very like this Process I mean Liquors hardening into Stone is commonly seen in the Effects of pe trifying Waters where as soon as the stony Juice  See Tab V Fig 22 meets253 meets a proper Nidus of Wood Reed Grass or the like it will forsake its State of FIuidity and become a solid Stone Why then should it seem more un accountable or difficult to conceive that the same Alteration should happen in the Bowels of the Earth and in larger Masses of Matter For as the same Cause will in like and equal Circumstances produce the same Effect so to produce a greater Effect viz an Alteration of Form or Motion in a greater Quan tity of Materials there is need only of a propor tionably greater Force in the Cause it being as easy for a powerful Effort to produce a Rock or a Moun tain as for a smaller Force to congeal a Pebble or form the smallest Gem If it were possible there fore for us to be as attentive Witnesses of the Changes which happen under the Surface as we are of those which appear on the Banks of every petrifying Spring we should discover many new Stones produced every now  and  then which by their Firmness appear now to have been as old as the World 3 It is indeed a vulgar Mistake to imagine that Time has added or shall add to the Firmness of a Spar or because it is so hard and compact a Body that it cannot therefore but be as old as the first Formation of Things for Spar be comes as hard at the first Time of its consolidating as it will be ever after as we find by the exact 3 Since the Writing of the following Treatise Mr Hill Nat Hist of Fossils p 157 by a curious chemical Investigation of the lapideous Contents of Water says  That Stones and Minerals  formed of Crystal and Spar need not be supposed all of them as  old as the Creation or Deluge but may be and unquestionably  are formed to this Day Shape254 Shape and the smooth Sides which Cornish Dia monds make in Incrustations and all after and se condary Concretions This sparry Liquor is stiff and sluggish and apt to harden but it is a Liquor how ever before it becomes a Stone  Nor is this Opinion singular but adopted by many of the Mo derns as well as Antients Pliny 4 from the Re semblance that Crystals have to Water carried this Hypothesis much too far and thought them to be nothing more than Water congealed by excessive Cold and Diodorus esteems them no better than a Concretion of pure Water assigning however a dif ferent Cause concluding them hardend by a divine Heat Agricola makes the Succus lapidescens the original Matter of which Stones are formed some by the Heat others by the Cold 5 they meet with during the State of Fluidity 6 Mr Geoffroys Hy pothesis supposes Crystal to be formed of thin equable Plates that Water is the Vehicle of cry stalline Parts and when those Parts meet together in any Quantities the Water easily evaporating leaves the Crystals to form themselves into hard pellucid Bodies Mr Boyles Opinion was that these Bodies were originally in a fluid State 7 4 Lib 37  2 5  Utroque enim modo effici potest Lapis Ag de Ort Subt Lib 4 Basil Edit p 57 6 Ib p 56 7 See Boerhaaves Theory of Chemistry by Shaw Not 120 S E C T255 S E C T 2 Whence this Fluidity Tis Water that first occasions and afterwards maintains this Fluidity and the Reason why we find none of this sparry Mass in its fluid State nor ever see this lapideous Juice is because that whilst it remains incorporated with the Water it is not to be distinguishd from the Liquor in which it swims and as soon as ever it is deserted by the Water that circulated it in the Bowels of the Earth and other necessary Cir cumstances concur to produce that Change it be comes Stone By Water it is that the sparry Atoms are washed forth out of their Repositories 8 col lected into a thick transparent or opaque Juice the stony Particles attracting each other as much as the intermediate Water will give leave and as soon as the redundant Water is drained off or evaporated the lapideous Parts now more at Liberty accede to a closer Union and are assisted greatly therein as well by the condensing Nature of Cold which com presses the Parts and forces them nearer one to the other as by sudden evaporating Heats and thus the Stone forms itself so much Water resting in the Pores and Interstices of the Parts in proportion to the Number and Magnitude of those Pores as is neces 8 Woodwards Nat Hist of the Earth 2d Edit p 189  Water is the only Agent that educes the Matter of which they  viz Spar and Crystal consist out of the Strata and compiles  and forms it in the perpendicular Fissures Woodwards N Hist of Foss Vol 1 p 150 sary256 sary to fix it into a Consistency for as I apprehend there is no compound Body but by means of the Chemists Fire will yield some Water but as soon as all the Water is thrown off the Body loses its Hardness and Continuity and turns to a Calx and Powder Here Sir I beg Leave to propose a few Queries to you 1st Query Whether Spar is not the universal Glu ten of Stones distinguished from each other by the various Mixtures of earthy mineral or metallic Particles but all united by the sparry Liquor Of this I should be glad to have your Opinion for it seems to me that there is scarce any Sand Nodule Stone or Ore which either by the naked Eye or Glasses may not be discerned to have a certain Por tion of Spar clear or opaque in its Composition 2d Query Whether it is not reasonable to be lieve that Stones in all Ages have been and are still forming in the Earth in some such Manner as is here mentioned whenever the necessary Materials and Cause concur with proper Incidents 3d Query Whether this Hypothesis is not better adapted to account for testaceous and other extrane ous Bodies found inclosed so often in Masses of Stone than Dr Woodwards Supposition that all Stones were reduced into a fluid Mass by the Waters of the Deluge which Waters being those of the Ocean we cannot allow to have any such dissolving Power257 Power inherent in them and therefore they could produce no such Effect 4th Query Whether there are not Quarries of Stone which when left idle or unwrought for some Time yield a fresh Supply of Stone in the Chanels and Hollows of the said Quarries which had been before thoroughly cleared by the Workmen 9 and whether this will not confirm the Supposition that Stones formed since the Deluge in Places where Shells Teeth and the like Bodies were deposited by the Waters inclosed them in their Substance You will excuse this Digression S E C T 3 Different Appearances of Spar Our Cornish Spars are either plain simple and unfigured or figured into various and rectilineal Shapes All sparry Liquor is in itself stiff and sluggish and covets no Shape but being intimately mixed with Water which is the restless Agent to disperse col lect and renew all subterraneous Nature it moves as a Fluidby the Rules of Gravitation that is from an higher to a lower Position till meeting with a reten tive Bed the Water no sooner retires and leaves it exposed to a drier or colder Air than it dries and hardens into Stone in Shape and Size as the At traction and Quantity of its own Parts determine or 9 See Addisons Travels into Italy and Bp Burnet K k the258 the circumambient Bodies will give it Leave to fix and extend itself Plain Spars Sometimes we find the sparry Liquor spread into thin Plates on the horizontal or oblique Planes of Rocks sometimes we trace it in Sheets down the Sides of  sures and where it meets with Impediments of Gravel or Stoneit will resemble branched Limbs Clay Boughs and Stumps of Shrubs sometimes it drops from Vaults and Roofs of Caves whence it has the Name of Stalactites 10 In all these Cases it is plain that the Juice had no other Motion whilst a Juice nor appears in any other Shape now a Stone than what its own Weight or Gravitation during its State of Fluidity inclind it to In these unin formd rude Productions it is very plain I think that the Juice wanted those active Principles what ever they be which enable it at other Times to shoot into regular Forms Fig 1 TAB IV 11 is a Spar Pebble its Sur face about the Roughness of the Peachskin in closed in Part of its Socket which is also of Spar angular and puculated which latter Property is rarely met with The Coat or Socket is mixed with solid white Mundic and Cockle which last or the same Principle which throws Cockle 12 into this oval Figure seems to have determind this Spar to its singular viz orbicular Shape for it is observed that 10 It also veins or granulates or both every Kind of Stone and is oftentimes found to compose whole Loads or Veins without any metallic or mineral Mixture or any particular Shape more than the Fissure in which it rested compressed it into 11 N B The following Figures referred to are intermixed in TABB IV and V259 that where Cockle is plenty SparNodules round as Musket Balls and black in Sockets of the same Colour and Substance are frequently found  But as this Pebble was not black as Cockle always is it may therefore be questioned whether the Shape of it may not be owing to some metallic viz Iron or Copper Principle rather than to Cockle and whe ther Cockle itself be not more probably indebted to other Powers for its orbicular Nodules in such Sheaths than derive them from any inherent Acti vity of its own  The Exterior of the Shell or Socket has a thin Incrustation of gritty cinercous Mundic It came out of Wheal Royal Mine in the Parish of Cambron Cornwall Of Incrustations The next Appearance of Spar Bodies which I shall here take Notice of is that of Incrustations these sometimes make one continued Sheath Lump or Mass and inclosed in them we find Cornish Diamonds Grains of Tin and other adventitious Bodies plainly of a different Texture and Colour from the Crusts which surround them so that In crustations must be cautiously distinguished from the entire Sheaths or Laminae which compose the Co lumn of hexagonal Crystals and which are really formd at the same time with that Column 13 where as Incrustations are additional and after Concretions made on the before settled original Grains and Columns 14 sometimes these Incrustations are but Sprink 12 Cockle is a black shining light Stone free of all Metal different from MockLead common in the Tin Mines of Cornwall 13 See p 274 Note 26 K k 2 lings260 ings of the crystal Drops without any Continuity or mutual Contact and in this Case when the pearly Drops are themselves bright and transparent and the Stone they fix on of an Agate Colour or any lively Opposition the Incrustation is exceedingly beautiful On one shotten blisterd Spar I find the Incrustation white not pellucid flowing in parallel Threads by each other Fig 2 TAB V in several Places passing from one Tubercle to another with out touching the interspersd Hollows by which I conclude that this Spar was fixed on the perpendi cular Side of a Fissure that the Juice of this In crustation was of the Stalactites Kind and proceed ing from the same Cause descended in a similar Di rection Fig 3 TAB V Is a Bunch of semipellucid Spar shot into reclined Cones making an Angle of 30 Degrees with the Surface of the Stone the Sides of these Cones are a very curious Fretwork of little Spires or Bristles many of them sharp as the smallest Needle and pointing nearly in the same Di rection as the Cone on which they rise The Sur face of these Shoots is of a ferrugineous Tint but their inner Substance pellucid very little short of that Spar which for its Clearness is called Crystal and 14 Incrustations are so many evident Proofs of Stones not being formed all at the same Time for many Cornish Diamonds and columnar Shoots of Tin Cubes of Mundic and Grains of Lead are often broke off from these their Inclosures but the angular Cavities with their strait Edges and smooth Sides still appear in the Incrustation which plainly shews that the Diamonds and Tin Shoots c were first formd and hardend and then surrounded and united into one Lump by a successive Induration of these Crystal or Spar Crusts261 and more transparent than many hexagonal Shoots tis the only one I have seen of its Kind Fig 4 TAB V Is an Asterisk of the clearest Spar its Shoots or Rays are hexagonal  or gibbous in the Middle their Sides not plain or of one level Surface as our Cornish Diamonds generally are but ridgd near the Edges and some what hollow but not uniformly in the Middle the Points or Terminations were entire and sharp but not to that Degree aculeated as the former conic Spar but it is very plain that these Spires never had any hexagonal Apices The undermost Shoots spread horizontally but the other rise gradually making a greater Angle till the middle ones make nearly a right Angle with the Base which has a ferrugineous circular Spot in the Middle from whence the Rays regularly proceed on every Side Fig 5 TAB V These are some of the most singular Spars which have reachd my Obsetvation but the general Shape of our figurd Spars is hexagonal and these Hexa gons either consist of a Shaft or Column and a Point with the same Number of Sides correspondent to the Column Fig 6 TAB IV or are only Points that is pyramidal Hexagons stuck on at their Base upon the Surface of their stony Beds Fig 7 TAB IV In a thin Cake or Lump in my Possession one Half of the Spar shoots from one Side the other Half from the other and so incrusts the Planes of both Sides with hexagonal Apices Fig 8 TAB IV Here the Spar as appears by the Tendency of its Fibres when the interior Texture is examind strug gled to form Stems or Stalks to these Cuspides but either the Effort was not vigorous enough or through the Impurities of the Juice the sparry or 2 crystalline262 crystalline Principles had no room to extend or pro trude themselves into the Shape they seem inclinable unto so they lie blended and their Lincaments scarcely to be distinguishd from the general Mass Some Spars rise out of the general Surface into large orbicular Blisters thick set with hexagonal Points diverging as Rays from a Center Fig 9 TAB IV These Blisters or Protuberances are in other Spars subdivided into Numbers of other small orbicular Excrescencies and the Cuspides very small but like the pointed Shoots of most Cornish Spars hexagonal Fig 10 TAB IV At the Root or where they join to the Rock these globular Masses shew in what Direction the Juice exerted itself springing commonly as from one general Center and extending itself equably on every Side When the Juice is simple and of one Sort only the Rays are continued from the Center to the Extremities as Fig 11 TAB IV But when the Juice is of two or more different Mixtures and Impregnations which will generally appear from the different Colours and Degrees of Transpa rencythen theEffort is various and successiveprotrud ingtheJuiceaccordingand in proportion to the different Activity of the Stamina of which it consists and in both these Cases I find the coarsest and most terrence Part of the sparry Lump next the Center and the most transparent and purest shot forth to form the pyramidal Cuspides of the Circumference Though the Effort is various and multiple the several Juices preserve a Parallelism to each other and to the Ex tremity each Juice proceeding no farther than its own263 own Impregnation would carry it and therefore settling in parallel Lists or Lines behind each other and their Angles less and less perfect that is becom ing more obtuse till you come to the Rock or lifeless Lump of Spar which the Effort had no Power to move and thro which the impregnated and purer Juices escaped according to their Degree of Mobility The Base of one of these orbicular Lumps which has seven distinct Lists or Fillets one within the other besides lesser Lists markd h will explain what is here suggested Fig 12 TAB IV  These hexagonal Points do not always sit close to the Body of the Rock but are as often found mounted upon columnar Shoots of the same Num ber of Sides and these are what are commonly called Cornish Diamonds They are generally found larger somewhat at the Base where they fasten on the Rock than at the Top where they support the Cus pis Fig 13 TAB IV Some of these Shoots have also hexagonal Points at each End as Fig 14 TAB IV and are some times found single that is detachd and without a Root as the Naturalists say but I have them also in Lumps fixed Side by Side but in no parallel Direction Fig 15 TAB IV 15

Fillet of purpled Spar fort was faint and the Shoots e Flockwhite scarce perceivable 15 These Shoots are not always strait but are found sometimes bent or crooked but as this Deformity is owing to some accidental inter264 This is the general and most common Appearance of our Cornish figurd Spars and Crystals viz either hexagonal Points on the Rock or common Spar or fixed on Shoots or Columns of the same Figure but we must not imagine that Spar assumes no other Shape but what has been here mentioned There are also trigonal and cubical Spars but of these Sorts I have not yet seen any in Cornwall however as our Observations in this inquisitive Age are daily grow ing more extensive it is very probable that new and undescribed Shapes of Spars may often fall under our Notice What I have here mentioned seem most worth notice but to pretend to number them all would be very extravagant for they are varying every Day upon our Hands and new Mines throw forth new Forms according to the different Combi nations of their Solids and the Impregnation of their Waters S E C T 4 Whence the hexagonal Shape of Spars It has been observed before p 257 that Water and the sparry Juice considered simply without any other Aid will produce only the irregular shapeless Masses of Spar incapable of any Activity or Struggle towards Shape and Figure and deter mined only by the common Principle of Gravita tion to that Position in which we find it We must call interposing Force or Obstruction during the Time of forcing it will not I apprehend make the Body of a different Species as long as all the other common Properties are continued265 call in therefore the Assistance of some other Prin ciple to account for the rectilineal regular Phaeno mena of these sparry Productions As the general Appearance of our Cornish Spars is hexagonal and uniform there must be some one ge neral Principle to which this great Uniformity is to be referred If these Spars owed their Form to any metallic Principle that Metal would be found when the Fluor was thrown off by Fire But the contrary is apparent the clearest Spars yielding no Metal And indeed it may here be observed that when the stony Juice meets and coalesces with any metallic Particles that Juice shoots not into its na tural Form but by Tin is forced into Prisms and va rious Speculums by Lead into Cubes and by other Metals into other Forms So that it never retains its hexagonal Shape but when free of Metals As therefore there is no Metal in our regularlyfigurd Spars we must have recourse to another Origination and Salt as I take it is most likely to be that active Principle by whose Force the Fluid in which it is mixd be it pure Water or lapideous Juice is made to shoot forth into regular rectilineal Masses agree able to the original Shape and Figuration in which these Salts were first created Tis by the Force of Salts that liquid Bodies are thrown into all the geo metrical Planes Angles and more compounded Shapes the Variety of which is no less surprising than the Constancy and Uniformity of each particu lar Species the same Salt shooting still into the same Figure as is plain from all artificial Crystallizations when not streightened in Room or otherwise deter mined by heterogeneous Mixtures To produce Salt L l from266 from any liquid Body two things are requisite First that the redundant Liquor in which the saline Par ticles are kept too dispersed and remote to attract each other be discharged which is usually performed by Evaporation and that the Remainder be exposed to a colder Air This simple plain Process will pro duce all the Varieties of Crystallization the Salts contained will shoot into their peculiar Forms point ing forth their Darts regular Planes or Spires into such Figures as are proper either to their native or compounded Salts From this easy and incontestable Procedure of Liquids into figurd and solid Bodies to which nothing more is required than Heat and Cold may it not appear probable that something like this has happened and does still happen among our SparLoads in the Mine For Instance When the Juice of Spar impregnated strongly with Salts which have been from time to time imbibed is suf ficiently drained from the Water which not only col lected the sparry Mass but kept it in a fluid State either by natural Heat so common in Mines or by the Waters running off into Crevices where the stiffer Stonejuice cannot follow it in other Words when the Water deserts the Spar the Spar as soon as a colder Air succeeds 16 shoots and is protruded into Figures by the Salt which it contains 17 and thus 16  Crystallus est succus quem frigus intra terram conglutinavit Agric p 282 17 Mr Boyles Opinion is that such Stones viz Spars and Crystals were originally in a fluid State that the Figure of them is determinate and geometrical like the Crystals produced by Alum Nitre Vitriol in Water and their Texture like the Congelations of Salt produced in Crystallization by Cold Grew267 thus it happens that we have such figurd Bodies from the Spar which without those Salts would shew us no such Shoots as we call Cornish Diamonds but fix quietly into Sheets and even Plates or drop down whereever its own Weight would carry it What sort of Salt it is which inclines Spar to this hexagonal Form is the next thing to be inquired into and most probably will appear to be that of Nitre if we consider that the Resemblance betwixt the Figure of what we call Cornish Diamonds and that of the pure unmixd Nitre is so great that no two things can be more exactly alike  The known Figure of  Nitre says Grew Cosmol p 15 is a sexangular  Prism  Particulas nitri Listerus deprehendit  sexangulas tenues longas lateribus parallelo  grammis  ex altera parte in pyramidale acumen  desinentes Phys Cler 8vo tert Edit p 150 This exact Resemblance is sufficient to make us con jecture that these sparry Productions may owe their general Figure to a nitrous Salt which exerted itself at the time when the Juice of Spar became Stone and I shall endeavour to support this Conjecture only by one Authority which is that of the curious and in the Studies of Natural History indefatigable Linnaeus which he favoured me with in Answer to some Que ries jointly with the Opinion of the present Dr John Frederick Gronovius of Leyden  The Origine of  those Crystals 18 is a most intricate thing but  you may conclude  quod omnis crystallizatio a L l 2  sale Grew Cosmol p 14 after talking of the Regularity of Forms and the Salts of Bodies proceeds thus  Arguing says he that the Atoms  of the lapidific as well as of the saline Principle being regular do  therefore concur in producing regular Stones 18 Cornish Diamonds sent to Dr Gronovius from Cornwall268  sale quod crystalli gaudent figura nitri quodque  omnes generentur in cavo Hi viz crystalli quo  magis simplices eo magis puri  pellucidi Hinc  nitro originem debent quemadmodum gemmae istae  quae prismaticam nitri figuram exhibent As Nitre may be reasonably conjectured to give the ordinary and general hexagonal Figure to Crystals it may be as justly inferred that when they depart from this Uniformity it is owing to some mineral earthy or metallic Mixture some heterogeneous Salt which impedes the Nitre in its shooting and turns it into trigonal cubical conic or other unusual Figures S E C T 5 Of their S I Z E The next thing to be considered is the Cause to which the different Size in which these Bodies do ap pear may be owing Some Crystals are said to be a Cubit high Livia Augusta dedicated one in the Capitol of fifty Pounds Weight 19 and Dr Isaac Lawson late Physician to the Army in Flanders informed me that he saw a Crystal in a foreign Mine with its Edges well preserved which he be lieved might weigh about 200 Pounds Dr Wood ward reckons among his Cornish Diamonds a single Column or Shoot very large if it be three Inches in Length and one Inch and half in Diameter near the Base The largest I have yet seen in Cornwall weighs somewhat more than three Pounds is about ten Inches in 19 Pliny lib 37 c 2 Sir Hans Sloane has one Block of Crys tal which weighs between 40 and 50 Pounds and another about 20 quite clear and regular C M 20 Catal 158 f 98269 in Girt at the largest End and more than seven high from which Size there are of all Degrees down to the Bigness of a small Pin As the Size of this last mentioned is very unusual I have given a Drawing of it Fig 16 T A B V The largest proceed out of a large Course or Load of Spar but the smallest of all from small Bits or Lumps of Spar and the small pyramidal Apices are generally stuck on upon the Side of the large ones sometimes in distant Spangles other times in thin and broken Incrustations Now the Cause of these different Sizes seems to be this Whereever great Masses of the sparry Juice have happened at the same time to be in a State of Fluidity the exuberant Water drained off sud denly and consequently left Cavity sufficient for the Salts to extend themselves there the great Quantities of nitrous Salts mixed with the lapideous Juice in cline it to shoot vigorously and form large Crystalliza tions and from proportionably lesser Masses whilst they are indurating proceed lesser Diamonds If the whole Mass be impregnated with nitrous Salts the whole Surface of the Rock shall rise into Points or Spires 21 according as the Mass is more free or more stubborn to comply with the Agitation If the nitrous Salts are not intimately mixed but swim in Clouds and Bunches those Lumps only where the Nitre is shall be shot and the rest be plain This is the Cast when the sparry Juice gets into its proper Nidus or rests in its Fissure But where small scat terd Quantities of this stony Juice circulare in the subter 21 See Fig 4 and Fig 3 T A B V and Fig 8 and 11 T A B IV270 subterraneous Waters some trickle down the Sides of Stones and Fissures and alreadyformed Diamonds and sticking in little Globules form a Crust by Juxta position whose Points are sexangular their Columns short sometimes crooked and unfinishd At other times Water charged with these sparry Juices falling from higher into lower Parts of the Mine cannot but be dashed and dispersed about the Cavity in all Directions and thus it is perhaps that the distant Spangles like the Dew or Mist that rises from a Cas cade sprinkled on the Surfaces of all Bodies in their Reach are there congealed and shot by their Salts S E C T 6 Of their C O L O U R Spars are of different Colours and different De grees of Transparency some yellow some reddish brown green purple black some of a cloudy fleecy white some freckled with little Specks of various Colours and Magnitudes and others of a Water not inferior to the purest Crystals The Yellow is sup posed to be indebted for its Tinge to Sulphur and Iron or Lead or both the Red to Iron and per haps Gossan that general Companion of Copper Green to the Solutions or Rust of Copper Copper will also probably impart its Purple for of that Co lour we find some of our most beautiful Copper Ores to the Juices near it Black may possibly be indebted to Copper also of like Colour to Tin or the Par ticles of Coal but the most transparent owe that Advantage to the Purity and Simplicity of the Juices of which they are formed What this Purity is owing 2 to271 to cannot be so easily determined Some think to Percolation or straining through the Pores of other Bodies the lapideous Juice depositing the Sediment and Impurities which it may have contracted in its Passage Now it is not impossible but that the Water and that liquid Spar of which these Bodies are prin cipally formed passing by their own Weight thro a soft porous sandy Stone in the Oxford Bath and otherlike Quarries may undergo a Change for the better and acquire a greater Degree of Transparency but it cannot be so with our Spar on which we find the Crystals abovementioned For besides that these Crystals are found on both Sides the Stone 22 which in the Procedure of Percolation could never happen and in very large Shoots our Spar will no more transpire or exude than Glass it is of such Con sistency and Hardness So that whatever Filtration has happened to these Crystals must have befallen them during a former Percolation before they rested in their present Beds not from any sweating thro that Bed in which we find them as Dr Plot ima gines 23 Crystals therefore it is certain owe their Trans parency and Purity to the simple State of the Juices that form them but to what that State and Condi tion is owing is uncertain Whether it may be to some purifying Menstruum or Spirit that precipitates every kind of Sediment I do not presume to say I shall only observe that in Cornwall the clearest Diamonds are for the most part found in a dry lax sandy Soil where 22 See Fig 8 TAB IV 23  p 98 and Ramundus in Alonzo  p 36272 where no dirty or darkcolourd Loam Mineral or opaque Stones prevail So we may conclude in gene ral that if during the Fluidity of these Bodies no metallic or mineral Fume no Dust Clay or Sand was imbibed the Water and lapideous Juice make up a clear pellucid Mass If the Case was otherwise whatever Impurities the Waters contracted and had not at the time of forming discharged are still to be seen in the Stone S E C T 7 Of their H A R D N E S S As to the Hardness of our Cornish Crystals all I have to observe is that they cut well into Seals when they have no Flaws Their natural Points also will cut Glass but not freely or deep in which Particu lar they fall much short of the true Diamond Conjectures relating to the Properties of the true Diamond Of this I shall not pretend to assign any other Reason than that the true Diamond seems to have more lapideous Juice included and more intimately and congenially united under an equal Surface than any other Body in the World It has also very little Salt in it as Dr Grew observes Cosmol p 14 and his Opinion is confirmed by its being found in such small Masses and by its great Weight it can have little Water both which Observations are supported by its great Resistance and almost Immutability in Fire So that the true Diamond has little Salt and little Water consisting almost intirely of stony Juice con creted273 creted to which Properties its great Hardness may therefore be attributed Whereas in our Diamonds there is much Salt and much Water comparatively speaking which two Ingredients mixd with the lapideous Juice may incline those Bodies to be more friable and tender and deprive them of that Hardness which a lessreduced lapidific Juice would certainly have had This sems to me the real Cause of the true Diamonds Hardness and of our false ones fall ing as much short of it in this Particular as in Lustre But I must acknowlege that for want of sufficient Experiments relating to both I cannot decide per emptorily However by weighing the Cornith Dia monds in Water I find they are generally to the Weight of our common Watter at a Medium as 10 12 is to 4 and I apprehend that if they had more lapideous Particles they would weigh more as they find the true Diamond really does  I find also the clearest and brightest Cornish Diamonds weigh much heavier than the other which are more shady and opaque That they have much Salt also may be con cluded from their being projected sometimes into such large regular hexagonal Columns S E C T 8 Of the T E X T U R E of Cornish Diamonds There are some little Varieties in the Texture of our Cornish Diamonds which are sometimes to be ob served in their broken Sides and Edges but always and more distinctly in their Base Some are uni form of one Colour and Transparency throughout M m some  The Weight of Crystals to Water is as 2 12 to 1 of Diamonds as 3 12 to 1 See these Transactions No 488 p 451 C M274 some have hexagonal Sheaths described one within another as in Fig 17 TAB V In the first Case the shotten Juice was of one and the same Nature and Con sistency equally impregnated and the Production of one Effort in the latter Case where the Sheaths are one within another tis also the Product of one Effort or Shoot the Concretion of one and the same time as the tremulous Undulations upon the Surface of Water on throwing in a Stone are all the Offspring of one Force tho the first be strongest and the rest gradually fainter and less distinct But the Juices being differently mixd gave way to the Effort in proportion to their Sensibility of the Impregnation the most agile flying off to the greatest Distance from the Center and the most mixd coarsest and most opaque re maining nearest the Center 24 That this is he true Process and that those different Sheaths are the Pro duce of one Effort or Birth and not formed at dif ferent times and in Succession as Steno and Aldro vandus and some others say 25 is plain I think from the two following Observations 26 If the Juice which forms these Sheaths was impregnated and  at different times it would not form in Sheaths round what appears to be the Central or Mastershoot but would project itself into its natural hexaedral Fi gure If it were not impregnated but mere Spar only without Nitre or any other active Principle it would form itself as the Stalactites in a pendulous undulating Direction Drop or Wave upon Wave and in this Case these Sheaths could never surround in that neat and exact manner the central Shoot but 24 See Fig 12 TAB IV and its Description p 263 25 See Plots Oxf p 98 26 See p 259 Note 13275 but would be found only on the under Part of that Shoot where its own Gravity would inevitably carry it For it would be observed immediately that these Diamonds in the Mine point forth in all Directions which must consequently prevent every unimpreg nated Juice from hardening into a regular uniform Sheath It is also to be noted that these Sheaths are often found broke and interrupted But this cannot be owing to their being Gemmae inchoatae  non per fectae 27 for the abovementioned Reasons but to the Insufficiency and Want of Juice or to some ac cidental Impediments of Stone Earth or Sand which make those Breaks and prevent it from forming a complete Sheath S E C T 9 Of their D I R E C T I O N in the Mine Not long since I went with a Friend or two into a Mine called Pillion Erth in the Parish of St Just on purpose to survey the Cornish Crystals in their na tural Situation The Cave to which we were intro duced was not much larger than a common Bakers Oven and much of that Figure We had two Candles with us by means of which we saw the Roof which might in the Middle be about five Feet high from the Floor in the other Parts not so much The Roof was the most surprising Piece of Fretwork ima ginable and consisted intirely of Spar shot into Cornish Diamonds of which the large one Fig 16 T A B V was a Part I could not discern any coveting a Position M m 2 exactly 27 As Plot ibid ut supra276 exactly perpendicular to the Horizon but in every indifferent Direction they pointed forth very plenti fully of several Sizes sometimes in Groupes and Clusters sometimes single now crossing each other and now standing by each other with parallel Sides Some were smooth shining and clear others rough and opaque some veind with red like Porphyry others speckled thick with the smallest Spots of deep Purple and a bluish Cast But the finest of all were those which had innumerable little Diamonds or Sparks of the clearest Water stuck upon their Sides and by means of the Candle had a Lustre not to be conceived We gazed here in this incommodious but beautiful little Cave till we could no longer hold up our Heads and then crept out as we came in upon our Knees Now among the great Numbers of sparry Pro ductions which I saw in this Mine I could not ob serve but that they pointed indifferently in all man ner of Directions which I suppose owing to the great Unevenness of the Surface on which the Bases of these little Columns were fixd and for the same Reason I doubt not but in all concave Beds the Points converge as in all convex they turn the contrary Way and diverge as from a Center So that the natural Cause of these different Directions is pro bably no other than the accidental Form of that ge neral Mass from whence these Shoots proceed I would say that as the Figure and Regularity of the lapidific impregnated Matter happens to be when drained of all superfluous Moisture and by the Cold Heat or Dryth disposed to shoot so will the Ten dency of the Shoots both Column and Point be If the277 the concave Part for Instance of the Voluta of the Cornuammonis be set with Crystals their Points must tend inwards to the Center where the Tail ends being thereto compelled by the regular Contour of the Shell and indeed they are so in Fact as see Fig 18 T A B V But if the Crystal Juice chance to fix on or proceed from a convex Bed to which its Nidus and other Causes may contribute or be itself an orbicular Lump and equally impregnated on all Sides then will the Fibres spring as from one com mon Center and at their Extremities point forth their Cuspides in a circular Figure as in Fig 19  T A B V If there be a thin Plate of Spar equally exposed to Cold on each Side and having equal Room and Force to shoot it will throw forth its Points on each Side and the Line from whence the Fibres began to spring shall be exactly in the Middle of such Plate of Spar and the Figures shall cut the said Line at right Angles as in Fig 8 T A B IV whence it seems rea sonable to conclude that the Direction in which these sparry Productions shoot forth is generally rectangu lar or very near it to the Beds or Masses from which they proceed and that all the seeming Confusion in Pointings of the Cornish Diamonds in Pillion Erth was owing to the great Variety of Planes and Sur faces into which that large Body of Spar was harden ing when these Diamonds shot from its Extremities I am Sir Ludgvan OCt 18 Your most obedient

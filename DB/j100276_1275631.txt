subsidiary companies A dividend was received by the main corporation from the subsidiaries Plaintiff Internal Revenue Col lector attempted to tax such dividend under the Income Tax Act Oct 3 1913 c I6 38 Stat 114 Held taxable as income Lewellyn v Gulf Oil Corp C C A 3rd Cir 1917 245 Fed I Since the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution which gave Congress the power to collect taxes on income from whatever source derived was held constitutional Brushaber v Union Pacific 240 U S I the question has often arisen what constitutes taxable income of corporations In Southern Pacific Co v Lowe 238 Fed 847 it was held where all the stock of a corporation was owned by another corporation which handled the money of the former and kept its accounts the surplus earned by the former was nevertheless its property so that a dividend declared was income of the holding corporation It has been held that where property lying idle earning no money but having increased to double its original value and sold for such increased value that a distribution of the proceeds did not constitute a division of income with in the meaning of the act Lynch v Turrish 236 Fed 653 Money earned as interest and distributed as dividends is without contradiction taxable in come So why not where the property lying idle increases in value and the sale price divided amongst the shareholders If the original owners of the idle property had continued in possession and had issued stock dividends equal to the increased value of the property no one would question that it would be taxable income The decision in Lynch v Turrish is to be reviewed by the Supreme Court Income is defined to be receipts which constitute an accretion to capital and this would include increased value of idle property The instant case holds that an ordinary dividend from accumulated earnings is income The government cannot tax undistributed surplus as income but must wait until it is declared as dividends and paid This is true whether the dividends be paid to a stockholder or to a holding corporation Union Pacific v Frank 226 Fed 906 INNKEEPERIMPLIED WARRANTYLIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURYPlain tiff became a guest for reward at defendants hotel During the night fire broke out and in endeavoring to escape from the hotel plaintiff was severely 202RECENT IMPORTANT DECISIONS 203 injured The jury found that the premises were not as safe as reasonable care and skill could make them and that the fire resulted from negligence of an independent contractor who carried out the kitchen fire scheme Held that de fendant impliedly warranted that his premises were as safe as reasonable care and skill could make them and that as they were not defendant was liable Maclenan v Segar I917 2 K B 325 The defense in this case relied upon the rule that the duty of an occupier towards a person who is lawfully upon the premises is a duty to use reason able care for the safety of that person Indermaur v Dames 36 L J C P i8I The failure of defendant to inspect was not found to be tiegligence The court refused to be found by Indermaur v Dames supra and held de fendant liable upon an implied warranty This higher degree of liability arises whenever the occupier of premises agrees for a reward that a person shall have the right to enter and use them for a mutually contemplated pur pose In Francis v Cockrell 39 L J Q B 113 the proprietor of a race stand was held to have impliedly warranted that his premises were reasonably fit for the purpose for which they were to be used This same warranty was extended to theaters Cox v Coulson 85 L J K B Io8I But in the case of Sandys v Florence 47 L J Q B 598 the court impliedly held that a guest must prove negligence on the part of an innkeeper or his servants to recover for personal injuries In Walker v Midland Ry Co 55 L T 489 the House of Lords also discussed the innkeepers liability on the same principle though the case turned on a different point The conflict of authority in America on the innkeepers liability may be traced to the same error The courts have confused the innkeepers duty with that owed to an invitee An innkeeper is liable for injury to a guest upon the same principle as is applicable in other cases where persons come on the premises at invitation of owner or occupant Patrick v Springs I54 N C 270 The obligation resting upon an innkeeper to

impliedly contract that a guest shall be treated with due consideration for his safety and comfort Clancy v Barker 7I Neb 83 Lehnen v E J Hines  Co 88 Kan 58 The The significance of this decision is well illustrated by Stanley v Bircher supra where plaintiff failed in tort but could have recovered had the liability been contractual LIBEL AND SLANDR  QUALIFIED PRIVILEGtINTREST Plaintiffs opened an

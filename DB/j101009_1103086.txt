advance ment of the music department thus imposing on him the duty to exercise a higher degree of skill and diligence than is ordinarily im plied by law in a contract between master and servant Defendant was discharged by plaintiff and in an action for the discharge there was evidence that defendant was inattentive to his duties rude to pupils and other teachers and had in short about destroyed the music department The court attempted to cover the whole case by a charge to find for defendant if plaintiff by his negligence and discourtesy so conducted himself as to injure plaintiffs

higher degree of skill and diligence than is ordinarily implied by law in the relationship of master and servant 4 TrialInstructionsSufficiencyPresentation of Whole Case An instruction given as

the commission when so acting shall observe and administer the commonlaw and statutory rules of evidence should not except in rare cases call witnesses not introduced by either patty and if it does call such witnesses should swear them as witnesses called by the parties are sworn 2 Same Appeal Harmless Error Admission of Evidence Error of the State Corporation Commission in admitting evidence is not ground for reversing their order in reference to the location of a railroad crossing unless the other evidence in the case is not suffi cient to support its finding 3 SameNotice of Proposed CrossingUnder Code 1904  1294b cl 3 providing that before a railroad which crosses another road commences to work upon such crossing the general managing officer of the former road shall submit plans and specifications to the general officer of the latter and the general officer of the latter may apply to the State Corporation Commission to inquire into the necessity of the crossing within 15 days

tracks and which was served by the latter road with a notice in substantial compliance with the statute of the proposed crossing and which within 15 days after re ceiving such notice commenced proceedings before the corporation commission to have the propriety of the crossing determined could not contend before the commission that the notice was not a sufficient compliance with the statute 4 SameQuestion InvolvedUnder Code 1904 c 1294b cl 3 pioviding for proceedings before the State Corporation Commission for the determination of the necessity for a proposed railroad crossing and the place where and manner in which such crossing should be made and further providing that in case the method of crossing is determined upon the compensation to be paid by the party desiring to make the crossing shall be ascertained according to the laws regu lating the exercise of the right of eminent domain the question of whether the crossing of the tracks of one railroad by another is a taking of property within the constitutional prohibitions against tak ing property without compensation and without due process of law is not involved in the proceedings before the commission 5 SamePropriety of Crossing DeterminationConst  166 Code 1904 p cclxi provides that railroads shall have the right to parallel intersect connect with or cross any other railroad Code 1904  1294b cl 62 authorizes railroads to cross other railroads in the manner prescribed by section 1294b The latter section requires crossings to be so constructed as not to impair or obstruct the works and operations of the railroad sought to be crossed and requires them to be supported by proper structures etc Held that while a railroad ordinarily ought not to be permitted to cross the throat of the yards of another railroad at grade there may be exceptional conditions which will render such a crossing proper and the ques tion whether the locality of a proposed crossing is such that the cross ing should not be permitted is to be determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case 6 SameCode 1904  1294d cl 38 declaring it to be the policy of the state that the crossings of one railroad by another shall wherever reasonably practicable pass above or below the existing structure does not prohibit crossings at grade where the establish ment of an overhead or underground crossing is not reasonably prac ticable and would involve an unreasonable expense STOKES ADMX v SOUTHERN RY CO Jan 18 1906 52 S E 855 1 RailroadsAccidents at CrossingsEvidenceAdmissibility In an action against a

URTHER improvement in underlying conditions is on the whole reflected by the movements of the curves of our Index Chart in July but there is still no clear indication as to how soon we may expect a definite revival of business activity As in June curve B gives evidence of approaching business stabili zation During July it moved downward very slightly as the result of the opposing tendencies of the two series of statistics upon which it is based The series represent ing average wholesale prices moved slightly upward while that representing bank clearings outside New York City declined enough to offset the price movement and to incline curve B slightly downward In view of the fact that June clearings were increased by income tax payments not too much emphasis should be placed on the decline in the July figures 3 per cent and we may say that curve B has been practically unchanged in both these months Curve C commercial paper rates corrected for sea sonal variation fell more sharply than in any month since the peak was reached a year ago The actual rate on commercial paper is now 66k per cent compared with 8 per cent a year ago 81 per cent last autumn and 7 per cent or upward between January and May I92I This indicates encouraging progress in readjustment and gives grounds for believing that this fall will see better conditions in business Curve A however representing speculation which has forecast business recovery in previous periods of de pression moved downward chiefly as a result of the very small volume of trading on the New York Stock Exchange In view of the fact that the federal reserve system is absorbing surplus funds and reserves are not piling up in New York Clearing House banks as they formerly did it is probable that curve A will anticipate an upward turn of curve B business by only a short period As we have said repeatedly we consider the 2t LX X XW1  I II 12 I 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 IO II i2 I 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 IO II 12 I 2 3 4  i9i8

SPECULATION New York Bank Clearings Shares Traded on the New York Stock Exchange Price of Industrial Stocks GROUP B  BUSINESS Bank Clearings Outside New York City Bradstreets Price Indices GROUP C BANKING Rate on 46 Months Commercial Paper Rate on 6o9o Day Commercial Paper EXPLANATION Each of the three curves on the Index Chart is obtained by averaging a group of statistical series each group being composed of series homogeneous in character i e when corrected for the seasonal influence and normal growth the series of each group move in the same direction up ward or downward at the same time The series were all expressed in com parable units before averages were taken Our interpretation of the fluctuations of the three curves of the current index chart is based upon the relationship which was discovered among simi lar curves for the period I903I4 All three curves had wave movements but the upward swings and the crests of the waves were not reached simultane ously The major movements of speculation preceded those of business by 4 to I0 months and the movements of business preceded those of banking by 2 to 8 months The persistent decline of curve A and the equally persistent rise of curve C both movements beginning in November i9i9 indicated that a decline of business activity and commodity prices curve B would be inaugurated in the spring of I920 In fact business unsettlement was noticeable in April of that year The existence of the federal reserve system enabled us to avoid a financial panic but not a severe industrial depression Since last January curve C representing money rates has declined and curve A representing speculation has moved sidewise or downward Money is still relatively high and this fact together with the depression in speculation indicates that there is no prospect of a marked change in business conditions in the immediate future The movement in June and July of curve B represent ing business indicates that the decline of business which has lasted fourteen months is at or near an end 25I 2 5 2 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STATISTICS movement of interest rates at the present time a more significant index of the underlying conditions than the movement of the curve representing speculation II ECONOMIC SUMMARY SPECULATION The decline of curve A in July was almost entirely due to a great decrease in the volume of speculation the average price of industrial stocks 6850 being less than one per cent below the June average 69io The number of shares sold on the New York Stock Ex change was approximately 9290000 a decrease of 49 per cent from the June sales Some of this decrease is due to the two stock exchange holidays but the aver age for the other days of the month was much lower than the daily average in June New York bank clear ings decreased from i6850 million dollars in June to I5360 millions in July or 9 per cent This drop is accentuated by the fact that June clearings were in creased by income tax payments In the past July clearings have usually been about the same as those in June Dullness continues to characterize security markets The volume of trading has been small so far during August and the prices of stocks have not maintained the gains made during the last week in July The prices of railroad stocks have been somewhat less af fected than industrials The gradual increase in bond prices which occurred through July and the first week in August has been followed by a slight decrease Prices for August I7 were o9 per cent below those of August 4 the highest point since January of this year The continued stiffening of call rates since the end of July has had an unfavorable influence on all types of se curities BUSINESS Bradstreets index of wholesale prices was iio6 on August I an increase of 3 per cent over the index for July i This change the second consecutive increase seems to indicate that the decline of priceshas been definitely checked Further evidence of the same sort is afforded by Duns index which also showed a rise 24 per cent on August I by French wholesale prices which rose 2 per cent in July and by Sauerbecks index of British wholesale prices which rose i6 per cent in July Fruits and metals are the only groups entering into Bradstreets index which recorded considerable price declines The volume of business as shown by bank clearings outside New York City fell from 13230 million dol lars in June to 12800 millions in July or 3 per cent In the past July clearings have usually been somewhat greater than those of June The following table shows that the greatest decreases were in the Southern and Pacific states Business sentiment is becoming more hopeful or at least less pessimistic Although improvement is very gradual and hardly general as yet

brought its crop of unpleasant developments growing out of the depression of last year and there are still many uncertainties both at home and abroad But fundamental conditions seem to be slightly better and should continue to improve even though it may be slowly In the table above we give some figures showing the effects on the relative position of various commodities of the price changes of recent years From these figures it appears that the sellers of certain commodities such as brick coal and wheat received a larger share of the total selling price of the twentysix commodities in June I92I than they did in I913 while others received a smaller share A few commodities coal coke cotton goods which show a gain in the above comparison have lost ground as compared with June I920 while others eg cattle copper leather which show a loss as compared with I9I3 have improved their relative position during the past year BANKING The banking situation steadily improves Opinions differ as to the wisdom of the recent reductions in re discount rates in the New York Boston Philadelphia Cleveland and San Francisco districts but this action gives further evidence that the credit stringency is largely past The easing of market rates which has developed points in the same direction The commer cial paper rate is now 66k per cent and time money is in larger supply Call money was quoted at 3i per cent on July 28 the lowest official rate since the fall of i9i9 Since that date call rates have increased reaching a maximum of 6 per cent It is asserted by competent observers that there is now an ample supply of funds for ordinary commercial needs though borrowing for speculative purposes is not favored and in the country as a whole there is still a large amount of credit that can be liquidated only slowly On August 6 the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland followed the lead of New York Boston Philadelphia and San Francisco by reducing its rediscount rate to 51j per cent The ratio of reserves to demand liabilities of the combined federal reserve banks has continued to rise since July 20 on August I 7 it was 658 per cent During the same period bills on hand fell from I7I0 millions to i554 millions total deposits increased from 1693 millions to 1705 millions on Au gust 3 and have fallen to 1671 millions since that date federal reserve notes in actual circulation decreased from 2565 millions to 2504 millions The highest re serve ratios are reported by the Boston New York and Cleveland districts Bills to the amount of 54 mil lions were discounted by the other reserve banks for the Richmond Atlanta Minneapolis and Dallas banks on August 17 as against 6I millions on July 27 This decrease in interbank borrowing indicates an easing of the strain in these predominantly farming districts Tim TRADE BALANCE OF THE UNITED STATES DURING RECENT MONTHS Our favorable trade balance showed a very rapid growth during the last half of I920 In December the excess of exports of merchandise excluding silver over imports was 454oooooo the largest favorable monthly balance of trade reached during that year A marked decline took place from January to April this decrease amounted to 36i000000 or 8i per cent During both May and June on the other hand there was a considerably larger favorable balance than during April The decline of the merchandise trade balance during the first four months of the year was due to a decrease in exports at a time when imports were increasing although standing at a lower level than during I920 The recovery in May and June was due in turn to a decided drop in imports while exports for these two months did not differ greatly from those in April Both imports and exports decreased in July the resulting balance I44000000 was somewhat less than that in June The rapid decrease of our favorable balance during the first three months of the year may be partially ac counted for by the different rates at which the price levels of imported and exported commodities declined From July to December I920 the Federal Reserve Boards index of export prices declined 4I per cent and their index of import prices 46 per cent During the first quarter of I92i however the export price index fell I2 per cent while the import index was identical for January and March and only one point lower for BALANCE OF MERCHANDISE

exports had remained the same in bulk for these three months there would have been a reduction in the favorable balance of our trade due to the falling price of exports Of the total decrease of 36ioooooo in our favorable balance between January and April Europe and North America together account for 250000000 The trade balance fell off in about the same proportion for each continent imports from North America however held up better than those from Europe Our balances with Asia and South America both of which had been unfavorable to us for the years i919 and I920 were each favorable for some months during I92I For the latter continent in fact the balance for the twelve months ending June I92I was in our favor The balances with South America as a whole were favorable during each of the five months beginning October I920 The balance with Argentina has been favorable to us continually since that month it reached its highest point i8500000 in January I92I declined to 2000000 in April and has since increased III STATISTICAL SUMMARY A THE SPECULATIVE GROUP New York City bank clearings were I5360 million dollars in July a decrease of 9 per cent from i6850 million dollars in

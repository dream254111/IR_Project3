No 40 of the Coast and Geodetic Survey bearing the title Investigations of Gravity and Isostasy written by Mr William Bowie SCIENCE 350SCIENCE This volume is so important to geodesists and geologists that the undersigned believes that its appearance warrants more attention than merely a review of the ordinary kind and length Hence the present article is pre sented The volume is of especial interest because it is based on many more observa tions of gravity than were formerly available in the Coast and Geodetic Survey and be cause the discussion of the data is much more searching and complete than anything here tofore published The last preceding publication on this sub ject from the Coast and Geodetic Survey was issued in 19121 The conclusions in that publication were based almost entirely upon the 124 gravity stations in the United States and 10 in Alaska In the present publication conclusions are based primarily upon observa tions at 219 stations in the United States and are tested by observations at 42 stations in Canada 73 in India and 40 in other parts of the world374 stations in all This increase in the number of stations and of the area covered by them is important because the reliability of the conclusions drawn depends upon the completeness with which effects peculiar to a given station or a locality are eliminated and upon the extent to which sup posed general laws are found to be confirmed by the evidence from widely separated areas Within the past four years there has been one radical change in the relative method of observing gravity in the United States with the halfsecond pendulums the standard method of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Formerly each gravity observer carried a tran sit instrument with him and determined the errors of his chronometers on each clear night Now he determines the chronometer errors by the time signals sent out from the Naval Observatory at Washington special studies having shown that these signals are of ample accuracy for the purpose The time and ex pense necessary for securing a gravity deter mination at a station is thus materially re 1  Effect of Topography and Isostatic Compen sation upon the Intensity of Gravity  by William Bowie Special Publication No 12 351 duced and the rapid increase in the number of gravity stations which is the prime essen tial of future progress is facilitated The most severe test which may be applied to a theory or a supposed understanding of a group of facts is a test by prediction Such a test has been applied by the writer recently to the Coast and Geodetic Survey theories as to the intensity of gravity including the method there used for computing the effects of topography and isostatic compensation In the 1912 gravity publication already referred to Special Publication No 12 there is a map of the lines of equal anomaly for the new method of reduction This map based upon 124 gravity stations in the United States may be used in combination with computa tions for which the methods have been fully published to predict the intensity of gravity at any point in the United States Such pre dictions for 95 gravity stations based on the 1912 map have been made by the writer2 and compared with the observations made after 1912 at those stations The difference of prediction and observation was less than 02 dyne 149000 part in 54 out of the 95 cases Such a prediction may be made in about three days by an expert computer in Washington at a cost to the government of about 25 On the other hand if a physicist undertakes to determine gravity in his own laboratory by an absolute method past experience shows that after many weeks of time and an expenditure including salaries of many hundreds of dol lars it would be an even chance whether his final result would be within 03 dyne of the truth To reduce the probable error suffi ciently to be equal to that of the prediction which may be made in Washington in three days by a computer would require the equiv alent of months of time by an expert physicist Still more accurate predictions are certainly now possible by the use of the 1917 map based on 261 stations in the United States and Canada which is necessarily a decided im provement for prediction purposes over the 2 The writer took advantage in making these pre dictions of detailed computations which had been made at Washington of the effects of topography and isostatie compensation at these stations APRIL 13 1917352 SCIENCE 1912 map which was based on 124 stations only Mr Bowies general conclusion in regard to isostasy in the United States is as follows The group of publications of the Coast and Geo detic Survey dealing with deflections and gravity values shows that isostasy exists in a form nearly perfect in the United States as a whole also that there is nearly perfect isostasy in areas which form comparatively small percentages of the area of the entire country The abundant evidence presented supports this conclusion fully It is important to note that a conclusion of this general character was originally based not much more than ten years ago on a small fraction of the evidence now available and that although the amount of evidence has increased greatly and the evidence has been studied much more in tensely the general conclusion has simply been confirmed abundantly and repeatedlybeing modified only in details The largest anomaly noted in the United states to date at Seattle Washington 093 dyne was recognized as a very large anomaly as early as 1910 when only 89 gravity stations were available in the United States Since that time with an increase in the number of stations to 219 it is interesting to note that no other anomaly larger than 059 dyne has been found in the United States So also when the study was extended to Canada 42 stations the largest anomaly there discovered was only 045 and in India 73 stations the largest discovered was 078 dyne In other parts of the world only four anomalies have been found which are larger than that at Seattle Each of these four is on an oceanic island or near a steep continental shore The anomalies referred to in this paragraph are the residuals after topography and isostatic compensation have been taken into account in the computation The extension of the com putation of isostasy in a form based upon a few stations in a restricted area to other sta tions and to other areas shows an agreement with the facts which is substantially as close at the new stations and in the extended area as at the original stations in the original area Two additional gravity stations having now N S VOL XLV No 1163 been occupied near Seattle it is evident that this largest anomaly in the United States 093 dyne is a comparatively local matter not a characteristic of a large area The writer understands that additional unpub lished observations emphasize this statement still further It is evidently desirable to supplement studies of gravity made by means of stations scattered widely and somewhat uniformly over a large area such as the United States by intensive studies of selected small areas in which a large number of stations are con centrated The beginning of one such study has been made in the vicinity of Washington D C where observations have been made at seven stations within twenty miles of the capitol No discernible general relation is found be tween areas of recent erosion or recent deposi tion on the one hand and areas of negative anomaly or of positive anomaly respectively on the other hand The strength of the proof of the validity of the method of computation used in the Coast and Geodetic Survey for taking into account the effects of topography and isostatic com pensation upon the intensity of gravity de pends in part upon the extent to which the remaining anomalies seem to be independent of the topography around the stations Hence special intensive studies upon this point have been made repeatedly at the survey The latest evidence as set forth in this publica tion shows the remaining anomalies to be almost if not quite independent of the topog raphy There is a slight apparent tendency for coast stations to have negative anomalies But the indications are that this tendency is due to the prevalence of Cenozoic formations along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of the United States not to the nearness of the sta tions to the coast No other method of computation which has been published gives anomalies which are thus independent of the topography There is found to be a decided tendency for gravity stations located on Cenozoic forma tions in the United States and in India toSCIENCE have hegative anomalies that is for the inten sity of gravity to be below normal at these stations On the other hand for stations in the United States on preCambrian forma tions there is a decided tendency toward posi tive anomalies that is for gravity to be in excess The evidence of a tendency toward defective gravity in regions in which the sur face geologic formations are comparatively recent and toward excessive gravity where old geologic formations occur at the surface is full of inconsistencies and is weak except for the two extremes the Cenozoic and the preCambrian It is very suggestive that as the number of stations considered was in creased the evidence has become more clear and convincing The writer believes that the apparent relation cited is real and that it is important to determine if possible the true reason why the relation exists At this as at many other points Mr Bowie is properly cautious in interpretation though vigorous in presenting the facts and in calling attention to the evidence of relations between the facts Mr Bowie examined fourteen pairs of grav ity stations in which the two stations of each pair are at very different elevations although they are separated by a comparatively short distance in a horizontal sense In one typical pair one station Yavapai Arizona is on the edge of the Grand Canyon of the Colorado and the other station of the pair although only 2600 meters away in the horizontal sense is 1330 meters lower in the bottom of the canyon It is found that in thirteen of the fourteen cases the anomalies remaining on the Coast and Geodetic Survey basis of computa tion are such that if the anomaly at the lower station is subtracted from the anomaly at the higher station the remainder is positive The average of the fourteen differences is  014 dyne This seemed to indicate that there is some error in the formula used to compute the correction to gravity for elevation But  a careful study of the matter showed no error in the formula but it seemed to indicate that the difference in the anomalies could re sult from the combination of several causes 353 no one of which could alone make the differ ence Mr Bowie has made an extensive ingenious and careful study to determine from gravity observations the most probable depth of com pensation The methods of study and the re sults are fully set forth in the publication Much difficulty was encountered arising from the intimate manner in which this unknown quantity is unavoidably entangled with other unknowns in the computations and from the nonsensitiveness 6f the computed results to an assumed change of depth There is also some evidence of systematic errors affecting the computed depth Nevertheless Mr Bowie has succeeded in getting from the gravity ob servations an independent determination of the depth of compensation His conclusion is that the most probable value of the depth of compensation is 96 kilometers and that future values derived from much more extensive data will fall between 80 and 130 kilometers Having a keen realization of the difficulties of determining the depth of compensation the writer recognizes this as a welcome confirma tion of the independent and stronger deter mination of the depth by means of observed deflections of the vertical The conclusion from the deflections of the vertical in 1910 was that the most probable value of the depth of compensation is 122 kilometers and that it is practically certain that it lies between 100 and 140 kilometers8 Both these computations of the limiting depth of compensation are based upon the as sumption that the compensation is uniformly distributed with respect to depth In each case also the value is believed to be the aver age depth it being conceded that the depth may possibly be different in different regions Mr Bowie has computed the reciprocal of the flattening of the earth from gravity ob servations at 348 stations of which 216 are in the United States and the remainder in Canada India and Europe and finds it to be S Supplementary Investigation in 1909 of

observed deflections of the vertical in the United States was 2970  05 The very close agreement between these two independent values an agreement which is well within the probable error of either one is strong evidence both of a very high degree of accuracy of each and of very successful elimination of systematic errors Helmerts value of 1915 is 2967  04 It is based upon 410 gravity stations in various parts of the world These stations were selected carefully with reference to their rela tion to topography a precaution which is nec essary with Helmerts method of computation though not with Mr Bowies method Hel merts method of computation differs radically from that used by Mr Bowie yet the two end results are in close agreement It is the writers opinion that Mr Bowies monograph on the topic Investigations of Gravity and Isostasy is a notable contribu tion to geodesy It furnishes a new and broader basis for further studies by geologists and students of geophysics It furnishes new evidence of the steadily increasing skill and energy with which the Coast and Geodetic Survey is attacking the scientific problems which come within its scope It is hoped that this article touching upon a few of the main points in the monograph will help arouse such interest as will lead to study of the monograph itself JOHN F HAYFORD COLLEGE or ENGINEERING NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY EVANSTON ILL

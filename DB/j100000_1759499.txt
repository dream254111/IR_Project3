leads to a set of smaller rooms under the gallery of the lectureroom intended for special work and to be more ftilly fitted ul at some future time or as the needs of investigation shall make desirable Under the seats and openings into two of these small rooms are closets dotted in the plan which are convenient places for storage The first of these rooms is known as the weighingroom It contains a delicate bal ance Bl on a firm shelf and a Wiedemanns galvanometer Gm fixed on a pier near the door The telescope TI of the latter is attached to a column in the centre of the room In the corner is a small refrigerator R with a wastepipe This room as well as its neiglhbors has water gas and wires fiomn the tower Thl next or  darik room has no windows and is intended for optical experiments or for any work requiring the exclusion or perfect control of daylight A shutter near the door to the south permits any arrangement of diaphragms and lenses which can possibly be called for At some ftlture time a Thomson galvanometer will be set up in this room The corner room known as the  lightroom has no special purpose but is to be used for such work as may require a very good light and perfect quiet The position of tllis room in the corner of the building farthest removed from the streets is very favorable for uninter rupted quiet investigation In one corner is the  photographroom  for the preparation andl development of the plates Against the wall in the opposite corner a lpen1dulum myo griaph PM is fastened permanently in posi tion and covered by a dustproof case This is the instrument made by Dr J J Put nalr and described b him in the Journal of physiology ii p 206 Wires run fiomn this apparatus to the adjoining closetan arrangement that is found convenient for experiments with reaction time One of the southern windows of the lightroom has also a broad heliostat shelf HS outside so that a beam of light may be sent even into the assistants room or by a suitable disposition of mirrors into any part of any other room The remaining door of the lilghtroom opens upon a passageway which leads to the chemical laboratories and makes the departments independent of the main hall or the lectureroom for communi cation NCE 135 KRA KA TOA THE more the information accumulates with re gard to the eruption of Krakatoa on Aug 27 1S83 the more this phenomenon proves to liave been re markable and unique as a series of violent explosions From Nature of July 17 we learn tlat at the meet ing of the Meteorological society of Mauritius on May 22 several interesting communications were made with regard to this eruption among others a letter from a M Lecomte dated at Diego Garcia latitude 7 20 south longitude 72 35 east of Greenwich on April 24 describing how at breakfast on the morning of Aug 27 they had heard detona tions low but violent and attributing them to a vessel in distress had run and had sent men to dit ferent points of the shore of the island who were unable to see any thing to cause such sounds also how the captain and mate of the Eva Joshua just leaving Pointe de lEst to anchor at Pointe Marianne these places I cannot find but suppose from the account that they are near Diego Garcia had heard the same detonations and sent men to the mast heads without seeing any thing These with the previous reports from Rodriguez showed that in three distinct cases the sounds of the Krakatoa explosions were plainly heard at distances of at least twenty two hundreld miles and in the case of Rodriguez of nearly three thousand It will be remembered that in Nature May 1 it was stated by Herr R D M Verbeek tlat these sounds were heard in Ceylon Burmah Manila New Guinea and at Perth on the west coast of Australia and in fact at all places within a radius of about 0 or two thousand miles But these later reports from Rodriguez and Diego Garcia show that across the waters of the Indian Ocean with no land interven ing they were carried distinctly to much greater dis tances The still more remarkable atmospheric gravity waves which travelled round and round the globe in all directions from the Straits of Sunda and which were fortunately registered on the selfrecording pressureguage of the large gasometer at Batavia close by Krakatoa were also registered on the baro grams at Mauritius and here there were distinctly recorded four successive transits of the waves from east to west alnd three from west to east the same as shown by Gen Strachey to have occurred at some of the European stations But what is still more remarkable there is a faint trace of a fifth transit of the waves from east to west on the morning of Sept 2 ie more than six days after the explosions and when the waves liad travelled more than four times round the earth or about a hundred and two thousand miles The most sensitive barograph at the signaloffice in Washington also shows small waveswhich are probably the record also of this fifth transit and barely possibly of the succeeding sixth transit the same but tle phenomena at Washington as complicated by the fact that it is within about 330 of the anitiodes of Krakatoa and that the waves have different velocities east and west136 SCIE and also that the great circle through Krakatoa and Washington passes nearly over the poles and in this direction the velocity seems to be still smaller so that the phenomena for this region become lmore and more complicated for each succeeding transit and after the first two or three in each direction rather difficult to unravel Unfortunately the other few barographs in use on this side the Atlantic  to all of which the great circles from Krakatoa take an entirely different direction from that to all the eastern stations  are not so sensitive as the best Washington barograph and do not help much beyond the first two transits of the waves in cacl direction It is noteworthy that these barometric disturbances were first noticed at Mauritius early in September soon after their occurrence and were at once inde pendently attributed to the Krakatoa eruption but were supposed to be due to successive series of ex plosions day after day until the publication long after in Nature Dec 20 of the liscovery of Mr Scott and Gen Strachey sliowed them to be due to a single series of waves travelling round and round the globe from the explosions of Aug 27 Perhaps the most interesting and important fact appearing from these Mauritius records in connec tion with these waves is the difference in time of transit round the earth as compared with that de duced from the European stations by Gen Strachey The paths of the waves from Krakatoa to the latter stations are on the average something like 40 north of west from Krakatoa and to Mauritius about 20 south of west so that tile great circles make an angle of about 60 The difference in time of transit on these circles and in the two directions on each are best showii in the table below where following Gen Stracheys nomenclature the successive waves are nulmbered from i to vii and the odd numbers denote the transits from east to west and the even those from west to east

via Europe is Im 40m greater going west than going east vidMauritius it is lh 6m less indicatingas far as atmospheric currents are concerned an opposite effect on these two great circles which make roughly an angle of 60 NCE VOL IV No 80 with each other The peculiar progression in the individual periods for successive transits can hardly be wholly accidental and is in opposite irections the waves vid Europe going in each direction faster and faster anld vi Mauritius being retarded Per haps the most striking difference is that the mean period regardless of direction is nearly l h less via Mauritius than vi Europe a fact most strikingly shown by taking the wliole interval viii which for the five European stations where vii was traced gives 110 h 50 m and for Mauritius 103 h 54 m showing the wave to liave gone three times round the earth seven hours quicker vid the more equatorial route which is probably partly due to the higher tempera ture of the atmosphere along this patll andl also perhaps to the fact that this great circle passes over about as little land as any that can be Irawnl through Krakatoa These facts show more forcibly how complicated the phenomena must llave been near the antipodes of Krakatoa andl also at tlle latter place upon the returns of the waves thiere It is evident that when the Krakatoa committee of the Royal society sliall have collected all the data many interesting problems will arise in connection witli these atmospheric waves and in connection with the distribution of Krakatoa dust by the upper currents which it may now be regarded as pretty well settled was the cause of the widespread redsunset phenomena tle explo sive eruption of Krakatoa promises if thoroughly investigated to teach us more about the circulation of our

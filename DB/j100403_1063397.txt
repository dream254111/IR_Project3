INVESTIGATIONS FREQUENTLY PROVE ACCUSATIONS GROUNDLESS AND RETRACTIONS ARE MADE BUT THE MISCHIEF HAS BEEN DONE AS THERE IS NO SUCH THRILL IN READING OF THE DISCHARGE OF A PRISONER AS THERE IS IN IMAGINING A FARREACHING CONSPIRACY AND NO EXCITEMENT TO BE GATHERED FROM NEWS THAT EXAMINATION HAS PROVEN SUSPICION GROUNDLESS CRITICISM OF OFFICIAL CONDUCT IS PERHAPS ESSENTIAL IT IS CER TAINLY CUSTOMARY BUT THERE SHOULD BE SOME ADEQUATE PROTEC TION TO PRIVATE REPUTATION ESPECIALLY IN TIMES LIKE THESE WHEN THE PRINTED CHARGE IS SO EAGERLY RECEIVED IN MANY INSTANCES A WIDE PUBLICATION OF AN ACCUSATION OF DISLOYAL CONDUCT HAS WRECKED BUSINESS AND DESTROYED HAPPINESS YET WHEN REDRESS IS SOUGHT THE PARTY LIBELLED IS CONFRONTED BY THE FACT THAT AS THE PUBLICATION MADE WAS MERELY AN ACCOUNT OF LEGAL ACTION TAKEN A DAMAGE SUIT WOULD BE FRUITLESS IT IS AN APPROPRIATE TIME THEREFORE TO ASK WHAT PROTECTION DO THE EXISTING LAWS AFFORD AGAINST THE PRINTING OF PROCEEDINGS HAD IN COURTS OR CHARGES MADE TO INVESTIGATING COMMITTEES DIS TRICT ATTORNEYS AND LEGISLATIVE BODIES IS THE PROTECTION AFFORDED ADEQUATE AND IF NOT CAN THERE BE A PROPER REMEDY WITHOUT IN TERFERING WITH A LAWFUL

WHERE THOSE WHO PLACE THEM ON RECORD ARE LIABLE FOR THEIR ACTION IN SO DOING MOREOVER WHEN THE REASONS WHICH HAVE ACTUATED THE COURTS IN PERMITTING THE PRESS TO GO TO THE LENGTHS WHICH IT HAS DONE IN MANY INSTANCES ARE ANALYZED THEY SEEM NOT TO BE BASED UPON ANY PRINCIPLE WHICH WOULD PREVENT A CHANGE OF RULING IN FAVOR OF FURTHER PROTECTION TO THE INDIVIDUAL THE LEGISLATURES HAVE FOLLOWED THE TENDENCY OF THE COURTS AND IN MANY JURISDICTIONS THERE HAVE BEEN STATUTES PASSED UN DER WHICH A RIGHT OF THE PRESS TO PUBLISH LIBELLOUS MATTER CON CERNING INDIVIDUALS HAS BEEN GREATLY ENLARGED SOME OF

UNDER NO RESPONSIBILITY WHATEVER PROVIDED THAT THEY DO NOT GARBLE THEIR REPORT OR WITH HEADLINES CHANGE ITS PROPER IMPORT AND MEANING THIS SEEMS TO BE SINGULARLY UNFAIR IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE COURTS THEMSELVES AND THE ATTORNEYS PRACTICING IN THEM ARE ALWAYS UNDER SOME SORT OF LIMITATION AS TO THEIR ACTIONS A CLEAR VIEW OF THE SUBJECT CAN BE HAD BY EXAMINING IN DETAIL THE RIGHTS OF THE COURTS AND ATTORNEYS AS COMPARED TO THOSE OF NEWSPAPERS IN THE VARIOUS STAGES OF THE PROCEEDINGS WHEN A SUIT IS INSTITUTED FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS A LIMITATION UPON THE MATTER WHICH MAY BE CONTAINED IN

ABSOLUTELY PRIVI LEGED19 YET THERE HAVE BEEN INTIMATIONS THAT EVEN THE HIGHEST JUDGE IN THE LAND CAN BE HELD LIABLE IF HE UTTER MATTER NOT RELE VANT TO THE CASE OR MAKE STATEMENTS AFTER IT IS CLOSED20 SO IF A JUDGE SHOULD FOR EXAMPLE AFTER A PRISONER HAS BEEN AC QUITTED BY THE JURY FOLLOW THE CUSTOM IN VOGUE IN SOME LOCAL ITIES OF EXPRESSING TO THE ACCUSED AN OPINION AS TO HIS GUILT VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE JURYS VERDICT A DAMAGE SUIT MIGHT LIE AGAINST THE JUDGE FOR THE UTTERANCES BUT NONE COULD BE HAD AGAINST THE NEWSPAPER WHICH PRINTS THEM PROVIDED IT DID SO IN FULL OR GAVE FAIRLY THE SUBSTANCE THEREOF IT WILL THUS BE SEEN THAT EVERYONE CONNECTED WITH A TRIAL AT LAW IS UNDER SOME SORT OF RESTRAINT THE PLEADER CANNOT ALLOW HIS FEELING TO RUN AWAY WITH HIS JUDGMENT THE WITNESS MUST CONTROL THE VENOM OF HIS TONGUE THE LAWYER MUST KEEP HIS AR GUMENT WITHIN BOUNDS AND EVEN THE JUDGE MUSTTRAVEL WITHIN LIMITS HOWEVER BROAD THEY MAY BE YET IF EVERYONE OF THE PARTIES TO THE SUIT IS GUILTY OF FOULLY LIBELLING HELPLESS INDIVID UALS IN THE COURSE OF THE PROCEEDINGS A NEWSPAPER CAN PRINT THE ENTIRE MATTER WITHOUT FEAR OF ANY SORT OF LIABILITY FOR DAM AGES NOR IS THIS POWER OF PUBLICATION LIMITED TO WHAT WOULD IN ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES BE CONSIDERED AS COURT PROCEDURE THE MODERN RULE SEEMS TO BE THAT EX PARTE PROCEEDINGS BEFORE PO LICE MAGISTRATES AND JUSTICES OF THE PEACE

SUCH A BROAD LATITUDE SHOULD BE GRANTED TO THE PRESS WHY THEY SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO PUBLISH MATTERS FOR WHICH THE AUTHORS ARE SUBJECT TO SUITS FOR LIBEL THE DECISIONS SEEM TO GIVE NO REALLY COGENT REASON WHY SUCH A POWER SHOULD BE VESTED IN THE PRESS AND IT IS APPARENTLY THE GREAT GROWTH AND INFLUENCE OF THE PRESS WHICH HAVE LED TO THE ABANDONMENT OF THE EARLIER AND CERTAINLY SAFER DOCTRINES SO FAR AS THE INDIVIDUAL WAS CONCERNED THE GENERAL IDEA IS AS STATED IN AN ENGLISH CASE THAT THE COURTS OUGHT IN MY OPINION TO MAKE AS WIDE AS POSSIBLE THE RIGHT OF THE PUBLIC TO KNOW WHAT TAKES PLACE IN ANY COURT OF JUSTICE AND PROTECT A FAIR BONA FIDE STATEMENT OF THE PROCEED INGS THERE 26 THE THEORY SEEMS TO BE THAT THERE IS DANGER IN SHADE AND DARKNESS AND SAFETY IN LIGHT AND PUBLICITY AND THE CASES ADVOCATING AND DISCUSSING THE RIGHT OF PUBLICATION REFER TO THE PROCEEDINGS OF STAR CHAMBER AND TO THE FEAR THAT THE IN TEGRITY OF THE BENCH MIGHT BE JEOPARDIZED BY SECRET PROCEED INGS OR HEARINGS THEY ALSO ALLUDE TO THE NEED OF KNOWING WHAT RULINGS THE COURTS AREMAKING AND WHAT RIGHTS ARE BEING DETERMINED BUT IS THERE ANY REASON WHATEVER WHY SUCH FEAR OF SECRET HEARINGS SHOULD EXIST AT THE PRESENT TIME ALL OF OUR COURTS ARE EXPRESSLY REQUIRED TO BE OPEN AND ANYONE INTERESTED CAN ATTEND ANY HEARING WHICH IS FIT FOR PUBLIC EARS AND CURIOUS MALES CAN EVEN ATTEND THOSE WHICH ARE

CONSTRUED AS A JUDICIAL PROCEEDING FOR THE PURPOSES OF NEWS PAPER PUBLICITY IT IS WELL KNOWN TO THE BAR THAT WHEN AN INJUNCTION IS PRE SENTED TO THE COURT FOR ITS EX PARTE ACTION THAT NO REAL INVESTI GATION IS MADE OF THE CHARGES OF THE BILL IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER ALL OF THEM ARE PERTINENT OR NOT THE COURT EXAMINES THE PLEADINGS TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY ON THEIR FACE MAKE OUT A REASON FOR THE ISSUANCE OF A FIAT SO THAT THE MOST SLANDEROUS BILL CAN READILY PASS THE SCRUTINY OF THE JUDGE IF IT CONTAINS IN ADDITION TO THE SLANDER ALLEGATIONS SUFFICIENT TO SUSTAIN AN IN JUNCTION IF TRUE THUS THE RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES CAN BE JEOPARDIZED AND THEIR CHARACTERS RUINED BY THE PRINTING OF A PAPER CONTAINING CHARGES AS TO WHICH NO PROOF MAY EVER BE OFFERED AND AS TO WHICH NO PROOF MAY BE

CORESPONDENT IN A DIVORCE SUIT UPON GROUNDS OF ADUL TERY SIMPLY BECAUSE SUCH A BASELESS CHARGE IS PERTINENT TO THE CHARGE MADE AND SUCH CHARGE PERTINENT OR IMPERTINENT COULD BE WITH IMPUNITY PRINTED PROVIDED THE BILL ASKED FOR LAN INJUNCTION TO RESTRAIN THE DEFENDANT HUSBAND FROM DISPOSING OF HIS PROPERTY THE INJUNCTION WOULD BE IN NO WAY RELATED TO THE CHARGE BUT ITS GRANTING WOULD BE JUDICIAL

LIBEL WOULD DO NO HARM TO A MAN TO HAVE IT PUBLISHED THAT A WITNESS HAD ACCUSED HIM OF A CRIME WHEN THE REPORT AT THE SAME TIME DECLARED THAT A JURY HAD FOUND HIM NOT GUILTY OF IT BUT THE PRINTING OF THE CHARGE ON ONE DAY IN GLARING AND CONSPICUOUS HEADLINES AND THE PRINTING OF THE ACQUITTAL ON THE NEXT IN A MUCH LESS CONSPICUOUS WAY MAY WELL CAST A TAINT WHICH YEARS ALONE WILL OBLITERATE THE

NESS OR FOR THE PUBLICATION OF EVERY SENSATIONAL BILL AS SOON AS IT COULD BE DONE WITHOUT LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES THE ARGUMENT OF CERTAIN CASES THAT A MATTER OF PUBLIC INTEREST MIGHT LAST FOR DAYS

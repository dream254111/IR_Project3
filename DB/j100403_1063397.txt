glaring headlines charges against either private individ uals or officials accusing them of misconduct ranging all the way from mere incompetency to actual treason Counter charges follow investigations frequently prove accusations groundless and retractions are made but the mischief has been done as there is no such thrill in reading of the discharge of a prisoner as there is in imagining a farreaching conspiracy and no excitement to be gathered from news that examination has proven suspicion groundless Criticism of official conduct is perhaps essential it is cer tainly customary But there should be some adequate protec tion to private reputation especially in times like these when the printed charge is so eagerly received In many instances a wide publication of an accusation of disloyal conduct has wrecked business and destroyed happiness yet when redress is sought the party libelled is confronted by the fact that as the publication made was merely an account of legal action taken a damage suit would be fruitless It is an appropriate time therefore to ask what protection do the existing laws afford against the printing of proceedings had in courts or charges made to investigating committees dis trict attorneys and legislative bodies Is the protection afforded adequate and if not can there be a proper remedy without in terfering with a lawful freedom of the press The power to prohibit by legislative enactment the publishVIRGINIA LAW REVIEW ing of immoral matters or other things unfit for circulation is very clear 1 and where a newspaper has as its most promi nent features immoral and degrading articles which as the Court says tend to taint the social atmosphere the power to suppress such publication exists2 Of course the right to a free press does not authorize one to publish articles advocating and advising revolution and murder or otherwise seditious3 These classes of cases however belong more to the realm of public offenses than to that of private wrongs and will not be considered further The State seems able to protect itself at all times from any serious attacks upon the part of the press and from any real abuse of its powers On the other hand the rights of the in dividual have apparently decreased in importance and the modem tendency seems to be to allow publication of matters which are of record even in cases where those who place them on record are liable for their action in so doing Moreover when the reasons which have actuated the courts in permitting the press to go to the lengths which it has done in many instances are analyzed they seem not to be based upon any principle which would prevent a change of ruling in favor of further protection to the individual The legislatures have followed the tendency of the courts and in many jurisdictions there have been statutes passed un der which a right of the press to publish libellous matter con cerning individuals has been greatly enlarged Some of the courts have courageously refused to yield to the growing in fluence of the press and have declared these statutes unconsti tutional4 But in other jurisdictions such statutes have been sustained although construed rigidly in favor of the party li belled5 1 State v McKee 73 Conn 18 46 Atl 409 State v Van Wye 136 Mo 227 37 S W 938 2 In re Banks 56 Kan 242 42 Pac 693 3People v Most 171 N Y 423

514PUBLICATION OF RECORD LIBEL The protection afforded to private reputation by the older decisions seems to have been almost completely swept away in many respects so that there is no remedy for an individual so long as the matter published has been placed on record and some sort of court action taken upon it Under these circum stances the general rule seems to be that a newspaper can pub lish as much as it pleases so long as its report is fair impartial and accurate6 In other words so long as the newspaper pub lishes what the papers really contain or what was really done in court they are under no responsibility whatever provided that they do not garble their report or with headlines change its proper import and meaning This seems to be singularly unfair in view of the fact that the courts themselves and the attorneys practicing in them are always under some sort of limitation as to their actions A clear view of the subject can be had by examining in detail the rights of the courts and attorneys as compared to those of newspapers in the various stages of the proceedings When a suit is instituted for example there is a limitation upon the matter which may be contained in the pleadings filed even where the courts seem to have allowed the broadest lati tude to the pleader They require that the allegations in the bill must be pertinent to the issue or fairly supposed to be so although not in the strictest sense relevant7 and this rule seems to be one of general acceptation8 Even this rule is sub ject to considerable opposition and to those solicitous of the reputation of individuals the dissenting opinion in Crockett v McLanahan9 seems to contain much more humanity and char ity if not better law than the majority decision But although the pleader is

which desires to publish the pleadings is unlimited in its power Its authority seems to be to publish any paper upon which court action has been taken10 and the action of the court may be taken ex parte and may even be a hearing for a continuance or change of venue Thus it has been held that where a bill containing slanderous statements had been presented to a chancellor for a fiat and he had issued an injunction thereon that such action constituted sufficient court action to make the publication by the newspaper a privi leged one1 And where a change of venue was asked and no proof whatever taken the action of the court upon the motion was held sufficient court action to entitle a paper to publish the allegations of a very vigorous answer12 After the case has been brought to issue and actually placed on trial the right of publication on the part of the press seems almost unlimited Whatever takes place in court can be printed irrespective of whether the proceedings were material to the issue or howsoever scandalous and libellous they may be The courts of course possess the right to prohibit the pub lication of their proceedings entirely 13 but this right is one which is exercised again in the interest of public policy and not for the protection of any individual who may be slandered by testimony So long as the newspaper account contains sub stantially what occurred it is protected although the witness who uttered the language published may be held for libel The witness indeed must make his answers responsive to pertinent questions and must answer without malice and in a way that is generally competent14 The witness is not required to determine definitely the ma teriality or responsiveness or pertinency of his answersl5 But on the other hand he cannot without inquiry and influenced 10 American Pub Co v Gamble 115 Tenn 663  American Pub Co v Gamble supra Meriwether v George Knapp  Co 211 Mo 199 109 S W 750 16 L R A N S 953 13 Tate v State 132

to the lay mind16 He must bona fide believe that the facts stated by him are true and with some show of reason be of the opinion that his testimony is material But when the witness who because of malice and illwill has subjected himself to a libel suit by his testimony has ac tually delivered his venomous attack a newspaper may publish it without liability When counsel arise to address the jury they are under some restrictions however their language may oftentimes appear to indicate the contrary The lawyers argument must be perti nent to the question in hand and cannot be mere personal abuse of witnesses or counsel without relation to the case For example where a lawyer as he claimed gently advising a sprouting member of the Bar said to him You are a vermin you are a disgrace to the Bar and are starting out in the wrong way as a young lawyer This will give you a black eye You and your client committed perjury You suborned your cli ent it was held that such language was not pertinent to the issues was personal to the party addressed and could be made the basis of a suit for libel17 And the annotator in discussing the case makes the statement that there is no dissent in the au thorities from the rule laid down in the reported decision Yet again although action will lie against the lawyer who spoke the words unless as in the case alluded to he has a de fense of provocation a newspaper can publish the attack with impunity provided it publish exactly what took place If a newspaper publishes a fair and honest report of a trial stating what was the character of the controversy and embracing the comments of counsel actually made during the progress of the trial there could be no recovery for such publication unless it was made to appear that the publisher was animated by express malice and this would be true notwithstanding that there were contained in the publication as a part of the comments of counsel words which if uttered elsewhere would have rendered the speaker and publisher liable in damages 18 16 Buschbaum v Heriot 5 Ga App 521 63 S E 645 17 La Porta v Leonard N J 97 Atl 251 L R A 1916E 779 18 Atlantic News Pub Co v Medlock 123 Ga 714 51 S E 756 517VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW Although there are the highest motives of public policy in protecting the utterances of the court during the course of a trial so that its statements are regarded as absolutely privi leged19 yet there have been intimations that even the highest judge in the land can be held liable if he utter matter not rele vant to the case or make statements after it is closed20 So if a judge should for example after a prisoner has been ac quitted by the jury follow the custom in vogue in some local ities of expressing to the accused an opinion as to his guilt very different from the jurys verdict a damage suit might lie against the judge for the utterances but none could be had against the newspaper which prints them provided it did so in full or gave fairly the substance thereof It will thus be seen that everyone connected with a trial at law is under some sort of restraint The pleader cannot allow his feeling to run away with his judgment the witness must control the venom of his tongue the lawyer must keep his ar gument within bounds and even the judge musttravel within limits however broad they may be Yet if everyone of the parties to the suit is guilty of foully libelling helpless individ uals in the course of the proceedings a newspaper can print the entire matter without fear of any sort of liability for dam ages Nor is this power of publication limited to what would in ordinary circumstances be considered as court procedure The modern rule seems to be that ex parte proceedings before po lice magistrates and justices of the peace swearing out of war rants and reports of grand juries are matters which newspa pers may publish with impunity Thus a fair report of an af fidavit stating that the defendant had stolen property made before a police magistrate was held privileged21 And the re port of an ex parte proceeding applying for a summons before three justices was also held privileged22 The American rule is apparently the same A fair and im 9 Houghton v Humphries 85 Wash 50 147 Pac 641 20 Kendillon v Maltby Car  M 402 P Ackerman v Jones 5 Jones  S 43  Kimbler v Press Assn 1893 1 Q B 65 518PUBLICATION OF RECORD LIBEL partial publication of an application for an affidavit to insti tute a prosecution was held privileged although never sworn to or signed 23 and likewise proceedings before a committing magistrate resulting in dismissal and even proceedings in a municipal court and statements of what occurred there24 And even proceedings before judges at chambers have been so held25 Is there any real reason why such a broad latitude should be granted to the press why they should be permitted to publish matters for which the authors are subject to suits for libel The decisions seem to give no really cogent reason why such a power should be vested in the press and it is apparently the great growth and influence of the press which have led to the abandonment of the earlier and certainly safer doctrines so far as the individual was concerned The general idea is as stated in an English case that the courts ought in my opinion to make as wide as possible the right of the public to know what takes place in any court of justice and protect a fair bona fide statement of the proceed ings there 26 The theory seems to be that there is danger in shade and darkness and safety in light and publicity and the cases advocating and discussing the right of publication refer to the proceedings of Star Chamber and to the fear that the in tegrity of the bench might be jeopardized by secret proceed ings or hearings They also allude to the need of knowing what rulings the courts aremaking and what rights are being determined But is there any reason whatever why such fear of secret hearings should exist at the present time All of our courts are expressly required to be open and anyone interested can attend any hearing which is fit for public ears and curious males can even attend those which are really unfit for any ears Under such circumstances what possibility is there that the 2 Beiser v ScrippsMcRae Pub Co 113 Ky 383 68 S W 457  Lewis v Levy 4 Jur N S 970 Moore v Dispatch Ptg Co 87 Minn 450 92 N W 396 Blodgett v Des Moines Daily News Iowa 113 N W 821  Ackerman v Jones supra 519VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW court should indulge in secret proceedings to the detriment of the liberty of the citizens The idea that some sort of action should be taken before proceedings should Ibe published underlies all of the decisions but they allow the most unimportant action by the court to be construed as a judicial proceeding for the purposes of news paper publicity It is well known to the Bar that when an injunction is pre sented to the court for its ex parte action that no real investi gation is made of the charges of the bill in order to determine whether all of them are pertinent or not The court examines the pleadings to decide whether they on their face make out a reason for the issuance of a fiat so that the most slanderous bill can readily pass the scrutiny of the judge if it contains in addition to the slander allegations sufficient to sustain an in junction if true Thus the rights of third parties can be jeopardized and their characters ruined by the printing of a paper containing charges as to which no proof may ever be offered and as to which no proof may be possible To take the case cited by Justice Wilkes in his dissenting opinion in Crockett v McLanahan27 the purest and most inno cent woman of the highest standing might be with impunity li belled as corespondent in a divorce suit upon grounds of adul tery simply because such a baseless charge is pertinent to the charge made And such charge pertinent or impertinent could be with impunity printed provided the bill asked for lan injunction to restrain the defendant husband from disposing of his property The injunction would be in no way related to the charge but its granting would be judicial action suffi cient to authorize the broadcast spreading of an indelible slur upon a womans honor Now if the public interest is in the rulings of the courts and in their action and this is a justification for publication what hurt is done if the report of the action of the court is delayed until after action has been taken and the case decided It 2 109 Tenn 517 520PUBLICATION OF RECORD LIBEL would do no harm to a man to have it published that a witness had accused him of a crime when the report at the same time declared that a jury had found him not guilty of it but the printing of the charge on one day in glaring and conspicuous headlines and the printing of the acquittal on the next in a much less conspicuous way may well cast a taint which years alone will obliterate The earlier cases both in the United States and England held that ex parte reports of proceedings were not privileged28 This was upon the idea that there was no final action contem plated whereby the truth or falsity could be determined a prin ciple apparently both sound and humane In an earlier English case29 the idea was advanced that pro ceedings should not be published until they had been termi nated Publication of results seems to be all that is necessary in order to appraise the public of the doings of their courts and to keep the fount of justice unsullied by means of the pure stream of publicity If it were really the integrity of the courts with which the papers were concerned there would be no need for daily re ports of the testimony of every slanderous and venomous wit ness or for the publication of every sensational bill as soon as it could be done without liability for damages The argument of certain cases that a matter of public interest might last for days before a decision is splendid from a newspaper view point but not sound when private rights are the main factor concerned What harm can be done in requiring newspapers to publish merely the fact that a suit has been instituted and the legal steps taken therein omitting comments and refrain ing from publishing the statements of the witnesses until a de termination has been reached Clearly the public is in a better position to judge of the value of testimony after it has all been delivered and passed upon than it is while the trial is in prog ress Stanley v Webb 4 Sand F 21 Rex v Fisher 2

clearly not the object of the pitiless newspaper publicity This appears from the relative prominence which is given to a suit on the civil side of the courts involving hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars as compared to the sensational divorce or criminal proceedings in many instances with parties of no consequence It is the sensational and the salacious which se cure the front page and the big heads while the really impor tant legal propositions are being decided in the unnoticed civil case If it be alleged that secrecy or temporary reticence would result in oppression of the lowly and the friendless the an swer is found in the newspapers themselves When the hum bler and poor criminal is on trial his case is unnoticed or dis missed with a paragraph It is the important malefactor pro tected with every safeguard money can secure who receives the special writers the first page heads and the extra editions Newspaper advocates will assert that their influence is needed to attack and overthrow those strongly intrenched by wealth and position They even aver that they have convicted cer tain criminals If this last claim is true it shows that the press is polluting not protecting the stream of justice To urge trial to criticize official fear or delay these are pre rogatives of the press which no one will criticize or seek to limit But when the trial is had it must be in the calm of the court room in an atmosphere of impartial justice not in the turmoil of the editorial sanctum choked with the poisonous gas of prejudice or sensationalism So clearly is this princi ple recognized that the right of courts to protect their proceed ings is established30 If we grant that the newspaper publicity has gone to lengths which demand some sort of curb what is to be the remedy We cannot directly prohibit the publication of articles on ac count of the freedom of the press guaranteed by both Federal and State constitutions But we can protect the litigants by statutes from the publication of matters pending in courts prior 39 Tate v State supra 522PUBLICATION OF RECORD LIBEL to a decision That the courts can do this themselves when they think it necessary is not enough as the hunger of the newsmongers would often make them use their most potent forces to influence judicial discretion in favor of publication and sometimes successfully Moreover we could largely extend the field of forbidden publications by declaring the publication of matters which are vulgar and sensational to be contra bonos mores and therefore unprintable It has been held that the execution of a criminal convicted of murder is a subject about which the newspapers can be prohibited from printing articles31 and we have already alluded to the power of the court to prevent the publication of immoral matter A declaration by statute that reflections upon the honesty and integrity of men and the purity and decency of women made in court should not be printed until proven would not in terfere with any constitutional right of the press if the deci sions above set out are to be followed Or if these remedies are too drastic what objection could there be to placing the press under at least as great a limita tion as the witnesses and the advocates and treating as libel lous the publication of all matters not pertinent and material As it is evidence ruled out by the court arguments reproved as improper and pleadings ordered stricken from the file can be printed with impunity Malignantminded advocates can thus ruin innocent people with the aid of a sensational press We protect ourselves against assaults upon our ears our sense of smell and even our aesthetic ideas of beauty and de clare such offenses to be a nuisance Should our sense of dec ency infinitely more valuable be outraged with impunity under the guise of protection of the courts An examination of any metropolitan journal will show that it devotes scant space to court procedure as a rule As a result in practically every large city special papers are published in or der that lawyers may be informed as to action taken in court What reason is there then why a sensational murder trial should 31 State v Pioneer Press Co 100 Minn 173 110 N W 867 523VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW be spread over column after column of the paper except the desire to give readers fed upon sensationalism another chance to gratify their taste The protection of private rights should be the first care of the State It is to secure such rights that society was originally instituted and as we have abolished all forms of private re dress for slanderous words have made duelling murder and cowhiding a crime there should be the amplest possible protec tion afforded to the individual against slanderous assault It is not an unusual thing for the courts to be made the me dium of such attacks through the filing of suits which are never prosecuted through testimony of witnesses maliciously given and frequently through matters put into court solely to protect newspapers in the publication thereof It is true that the press is so powerful that restrictive legislation cannot be enacted at the present time without its consent unless the lawyers present a united front but the press itself is so powerful that it does not need the lure of sensationalism to bring it readers and it could well subsist upon legitimate items of news particularly since the war has crowded even the salacious divorce to a place on the inside page Chas M Bryan MEMPHIS TENN 524

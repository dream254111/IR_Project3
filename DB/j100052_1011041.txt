J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1011041,AMENDMENT OF THE SHERMAN ANTITRUST LAW,I242591,AMENDMENT OF THE SHERMAN ANTITRUST LAW1 BY THEODORE MARBURG BALTIMORE MD LAST AUTUMN THE NATIONAL CIVIC FEDERATION CALLED A CONFERENCE ON COMBINATIONS AND TRUSTS IN CHICAGO THE PRESIDING OFFICER WAS NICHOLAS MURRAY BUTLER HE SOUNDED THE NOTE OF ANTAGONISM TO THE SHERMAN ANTITRUST LAW AND THAT NOTE WAS ECHOED THROUGH OUT THE THREE DAYS PROCEEDINGS I MUST CONFESS I WAS SURPRISED I HAD NO IDEA THERE WAS SUCH WIDESPREAD CONVICTION THAT THE TIME HAD COME FOR A MODIFICATION OF THE SHERMAN ANTITRUST LAW TRUE THIS LAW HAS BEEN ON THE STATUTE BOOKS EIGHTEEN YEARS AND ONLY RECENTLY HAVE WE WITNESSED A MOVEMENT FOR ITS MODIFICA TION THAT IS BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT ATTEMPTED SERIOUSLY TO ENFORCE IT UNTIL WITHIN THE PAST FEW YEARS WE SEE WHAT DIS ASTER HAS ATTENDED THE VERY BEGINNING OF THIS ATTEMPT AS A RESULT OF THE CIVIC FEDERATION CONFERENCE THERE IS A MEASURE BEFORE CONGRESS INTENDED TO CORRECT THE EVILS OF THE SHER MAN ANTITRUST LAW IT IS THE HEPBURN BILL CRITICISMS UPON THE MEASURE SINCE ITS INTRODUCTION INTO THE HOUSE HAVE LED ITS FRIENDS TO MODIFY IT IN SEVERAL PARTICULARS FIRST BY LEAVING UNDER THE BAN OF THE LAW THE POOLING OF TRAFFIC BY RAILROADS WHILE PERMITTING REASONABLE RATE AGREEMENTS SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION SECOND BY PROVIDING FOR AN APPEAL FROM THE DECISION OF THE COMMISSIONER OF CORPORATIONS TO THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COM MISSION AND THEN TO THE COURTS THIRD BY SO MODIFYING THE CLAUSE RELATING TO LABOR AS TO REMOVE ALL DOUBT ABOUT THE BOYCOTT AND BLACKLIST STILL COMING UNDER THE PROHIBITION OF THE SHERMAN LAW THAT LAW IT WILL BE REMEMBERED PROHIBITS ALL COMBINATIONS IN RESTRAINT OF INTERSTATE TRADE WHETHER SUCH COMBINATION BE REASONABLE OR UNREASONABLE IT MAKES NO DISTINCTION OWING TO THE SCALE OF BUSINESS TODAY THERE ARE VERY FEW COMBINATIONS OR AGREEMENTS 1DISCUSSION BEFORE THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE PHILADELPHIA PA APRIL 11 1908 34AMENDMENT OF THE SHERMAN ANTITRUST LAW WHICH MAY NOT BE INTERPRETED AS IN RESTRAIAT OF INTERSTATE TRADE MANY OF THEM ARE THOUGHT TO BE NECESSARY TO THE SUCCESSFUL CON DUCT OF BUSINESS IN ITS PRESENT SCOPE I E ARE REASONABLE IN THEIR PURPOSE AND RESULT IF THE SHERMAN LAW WERE IMPARTIALLY AND GENERALLY ENFORCED IT WOULD BRING ABOUT CHAOS IN THE BUSINESS WORLD THE MERE UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHOM IT MAY STRIKE HAS DEVELOPED A FEELING OF UNREST AND CONCERN WHICH IS INIMICAL TO THE BEST INTER ESTS OF THE COUNTRY RIVALRY IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF BUSINESS AND CRUSH ING THE COMPETITOR IS A NECESSARY COINCIDENT OF RIVALRY BY SUPERIOR ORGANIZATION OR INVENTIVE GENIUS A BUSINESS MAN SUP PLIES COMMODITIES SO GOOD OR SO CHEAP AS TO CAUSE A RIVAL TO RETIRE FROM BUSINESS HAS HE DONE ANYTHING THAT IS MORALLY WRONG QUITE THE OPPOSITE TO A CERTAIN DEGREE PROGRESS IS ACTUALLY DEPENDENT ON HIM CRUSHING THE COMPETITOR IS SIMPLY ELIMINATING THE UNFIT THE PUBLIC SUFFERS ONLY WHEN THE PROCESS HAS GONE SO FAR AS TO GIVE A VIRTUAL MONOPOLY TO THE TRIUMPHANT PARTY BECAUSE THEN THE VERY INSTRUMENT OF GOOD RIVALRY CEASES TO EXIST IN OTHER WORDS WHILE THERE IS STILL NO MORAL WRONG THERE DOES ARISE AT THIS POINT A QUESTION OF PUBLIC EXPEDIENCY IT IS ON THE GROUND OF PUBLIC EXPEDIENCY ALONENOT ON MORAL GROUNDSTHAT MONOPOLIES ARE TO BE PREVENTED IF POSSIBLE BY STATE INTERFERENCE CERTAINLY THE PUB LIC SUFFERS BY MONOPOLYAND THE DUTY OF THE GOVERNMENT TO PUT DOWN MONOPOLY IS BEYOND QUESTION THE WHOLE PROBLEM IS THE VERY DIFFICULT PROBLEM OF DISCRIMINATING ACTION WHICH WILL CONTROL WITHOUT RUINING THE SPLENDID BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE DONE SO MUCH TO GIVE OUR COUNTRY ITS PRESTIGE IN THE WORLD OF AFFAIRS NOW MANY OF US HAVE LONG BELIEVED THAT THE MOST EFFECTIVE INSTRUMENT IN CHECKING MONOPOLY AND KEEPING ALIVE POTENTIAL COM PETITION IS PUBLICITY I E SUCH KNOWLEDGE OF THE AFFAIRS OF A COR PORATION AS WILL ENABLE THE PUBLIC TO JUDGE OF MONOPOLISTIC PRACTICES OR UNFAIR METHODS AND THIS IS THE CENTRAL IDEA OF THE HEPBURN BILL THE BILL PROPOSES TO MODIFY THE SHERMAN ANTITRUST LAW SO AS TO EXEMPT FROM THE OPERATION OF THE LAW SO FAR AS PROCEEDINGS BY THE UNITED STATES LIE REASONABLE COMBINATIONS IN RESTRAINT OF TRADE INCLUDING STRIKES AND LOCKOUTS IT PROPOSES TO DO THIS IN THE WISEST WAY IN A NEGATIVE WAY AS A CONDITION PRECEDENT TO THE ENJOYMENT OF THE BENEFITS OF THE BILL CORPORATIONS OR ASSOCIATIONS FOR PROFIT WILL BE REQUIRED TO REGISTER AND TO FURNISH CERTAIN INFORMATION 35THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY TO BE PRESCRIBED BY THE PRESIDENT INFORMATION RELATING TO ORGANIZA TION FINANCIAL CONDITION CONTRACTS AND CORPORATE PROCEEDINGS THE COMMISSIONER OF CORPORATIONS IS REQUIRED TO REGISTER ALL CORPORA TIONS OR ASSOCIATIONS FURNISHING SUCH INFORMATION WHETHER HE APPROVES OF THEM OR NOT BUT AFTER THEY ARE REGISTERED THEY WILL BE ASKED FROM TIME TO TIME TO FURNISH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND IF THEIR FUTURE ACTS AFTER REGISTRATION ARE REGARDED AS IN UNREASON ABLE RESTRAINT OF TRADE THE REGISTRATION MAY BE WITHDRAWN THEY WILL THUS BE CONSTANTLY UNDER THE EYE OF THE COMMISSIONER IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT THE BILL IS NOT COMPULSORY NO CORPORA TION OR ASSOCIATION IS COMPELLED TO GIVE THE INFORMATION PRESCRIBED BY THE BILL BUT UNLESS IT DOES GIVE IT IT WILL CONTINUE UNDER THE BAN OF THE SHERMAN LAW EVEN SO FAR AS REASONABLE COMBINATION IS CONCERNED NOW WHAT ARE JUDGE GROSSCUPS OBJECTIONS TO THIS BILL AS HE STATED THEM LAST NIGHT HIS FIRST OBJECTION IS THAT THE BILL SETS UP ONEMAN POWER HE COMPLAINS THAT WE ARE PUTTING IN THE HANDS OF THE COMMISSIONER THE POWER TO STAMP A CORPORATION WITH LEGALITY THE TERM ONEMAN POWER DOES NOT FIT BECAUSE THE DECISION OF THE COMMISSIONER IS NOT FINAL IF HIS DECISION BE ADVERSE AN APPEAL LIES AS ALREADY STATED TO HIGHER TRIBUNALS IF ON THE OTHER HAND HIS DECISION BE FAVORABLE THE LAW DEPARTMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT IS STILL PERMITTED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE BILL TO DIFFER WITH HIM AND TO PROCEED AGAINST THE CORPORATION ON THE GROUND OF UNREASONABLE RESTRAINT OF TRADE IN OTHER WORDS ONLY REASONABLE COMBINA TIONS CAN BE STAMPED BY THE COMMISSIONER WITH LEGALITY AND THAT AT THE RISK OF HAVING HIS DECISION OVERTURNED BY SUCCESSFUL PROSE CUTION ON THE PART OF THE LAW DEPARTMENT IT IS OBJECTED THAT WE ARE SETTING UP A BUREAU TO DO WHAT SHOULD BE LEFT TO THE LAW AND THE COURTS THE ANSWER IS THAT THE POWERS CONFERRED BY THE BILL ARE WHOLLY NEGATIVE UNDER ITS PROVISIONS THE BUREAU CAN DENY CER TAIN PRIVILEGES IT CANNOT INSTITUTE PROCEEDINGS AGAINST ANYONE NOR CONFER DEFINITELY ANY RIGHTS UPON ANYONE WITH THESE LIMITATIONS LIMITATIONS WHICH MAKE THE POWERS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE CON FERRED UPON THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION AND ON THE UTILITIES COMMISSIONS OF THE VARIOUS STATES THERE IS A DISTINCT ADVANTAGE IN PARTIALLY SUBSTITUTING FOR A SWEEPING LAW WHICH ATTEMPTS THE IMPOSSIBLE A TRIBUNAL EMPOWERED TO DISCRIMINATE AND FOREWARN A TRIBUNAL WHICH CAN MEET BUSINESS METHODS WITH BUSINESS METHODS 36AMENDMENT OF THE SHERMAN ANTITRUST LAW THE OBJECTIONS ADVANCED ARE THE CRY FIRST AND FOREMOST OF THE INEFFICIENT WHO WOULD BREAK UP THE GREAT INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATIONS OF THE DAY BY MAINTAINING AND ENFORCING THE PRESENT LAW INDIS CRIMINATELY AGAINST ALL COMBINATIONS WHETHER IN REASONABLE OR UNREASONABLE RESTRAINT OF TRADE THEIR PLEA IS THAT THE PRINCIPAL OBJECT OF ALL COMBINATIONS IS THE CONTROL OF PRICES THAT IS NOT TRUE THE OBJECT OF MANY COMBINATIONS IS PROFIT BUT THAT OBJECT MAY BE REACHED BY CHEAPENING PRODUCTION AS WELL AS BY RAISING PRICES THERE ARE FURTHER COMBINATIONS TO EFFECT OBJECTS WHOLLY UNCONNECTED WITH PRICES OR PROFITS OTHER CRITICISMS LEVELED AGAINST THE BILL REPRESENT THE OBJEC TIONS OF EMPLOYERS WHOM THE ABUSES PRACTICED BY LABOR UNIONS HAVE SO ANTAGONIZED THAT THEY WOULD MAINTAIN THE SHERMAN LAW AT ANY COST WITH A VIEW TO CURBING THE AMBITIONS OF LABOR AND EVEN CRUSH ING THE LABOR UNIONS COMPLETELY SUCH MEN FAIL TO REALIZE THE VAST BENEFITS THAT LABOR UNIONS HAVE BROUGHT TO SOCIETY AS A WHOLE BY RAISING WAGES AND SHORTENING HOURS THEY FAIL TO REALIZE MORE OVER THAT ONE OF THE CONDITIONS OF A SUCCESSFUL WAR ON THE VERY GREAT EVILS PRACTICED BY THE UNIONS IS THAT WE START BY BEING JUST TO THE UNIONS AS WELL AS TO LABOR NOT EMBRACED IN THE UNIONS THAT WE HELP LABOR TO REALIZE ALL ITS LEGITIMATE AIMS FOR ITS OWN IMPROVE MENT MOREOVER AS MR GOMPERS HAS STATED TO MAKE LABOR UNIONS UNLAWFUL IS SIMPLY TO TURN THEM INTO SECRET SOCIETIES WITH MEASURE LESS POWERS FOR EVIL AS ALREADY STATED THE BILL DOES NOT LEGALIZE ANYTHING UNLESS IT BE REASONABLE COMBINATION IT OPERATES ONLY TO SUSPEND CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE SHERMAN ACT THERE IS NO INTENTION TO INCLUDE THE BOYCOTT IN THIS EXEMPTION BUT EVEN IF IT WERE INADVERTENTLY SO INCLUDED IT COULD HAVE NO SUCH RESULT AS LEGALIZING THE BOYCOTT FOR THE REASON THAT CONSPIRACY AND BOYCOTT WOULD STILL BE UNDER THE BAN OF THE COMMON LAW IN THE SEPARATE STATES SUING IN COURTS OF EQUITY IN ALL THE SEPARATE STATES INVOLVES ADDED PHYSICAL DIFFICULTIES BUT THAT IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM SAYING THAT THE BILL EVEN THOUGH DEFECTIVE IN THIS PARTICULAR WOULD LEGALIZE THE BOYCOTT THE OBJECTION RAISED TO THE PUBLICITY FEATURES OF THE BILL WOULD BE ADVANCED AGAINST ANY FORM OF PUBLICITY IN FACT THE BILL DOES NOT CONFER ANY NEW POSITIVE POWERS IN THIS RESPECT ALREADY AT THE PRESENT TIME POWERS OF INVESTIGATION ARE LODGED IN THE BUREAU OF CORPORATIONS AND IN TWO OTHER ACTIVE BODIES THE INTERSTATE COM 37THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY MERCE COMMISSION AND THE LAW DEPARTMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT WHAT RETURN DOES THE VICTIM WHO IS INVESTIGATED BY THEM TODAY GET ANXIETY OF MIND HABITS OF SECRECY AND A GROWING HOSTIL ITY TO GOVERNMENT UNDER THE HEPBURN ACT ON THE OTHER HAND HE WOULD GET A TANGIBLE BENEFIT IN RETURN FOR THE INFORMATION SUPPLIED HE WOULD BE RELIEVED OF THREATENED FINE AND IMPRISON MENT FOR ACTS WHICH ARE INSEPARABLE FROM BUSINESS ON ITS PRESENT SCALE MUCH OF THE CRITICISM OF THE HEPBURN BILL ON THIS PLATFORM AND ELSEWHERE TURNS ON THE EVER PRESENT QUESTION OF CENTRALIZED VERSUS LOCAL GOVERNMENT A QUESTION UPPERMOST IN THE PUBLIC MIND SINCE THE FOUNDING OF THE UNION AND ONE THAT IS LIKELY TO REMAIN UPPERMOST TO THE LAST DAY OF THAT UNIONS EXISTENCE THE FUNDA MENTAL CONSIDERATION HERE IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROBLEM WE ARE DISCUSSING IS THE UTTER FAILURE OF THE STATE LEGISLATURES TO DEAL SUCCESSFULLY WITH THAT PROBLEM IT BECOMES CLEARER EVERY DAY THAT THE BIG CORPORATIONS ENGAGED IN INTERSTATE TRADE CAN BE CONTROLLED SUCCESSFULLY ONLY BY AN AUTHORITY COMMENSURATE WITH THE FIELD OF THEIR ACTIVITIES IMPROVED COMMUNICATION HAS BROKEN DOWN STATE LINES AND THE PROBLEM BEFORE US IS THE PROBLEM OF INTERSTATE COM MERCE MOREOVER IS IT TRUE THAT WITH THE EXERCISE OF GREATER POW ERS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LOCAL ACTIVITIES ARE DIMINISHING IS THERE NOT RATHER A READJUSTMENT OF ACTIVITIES WITHOUT ANY LOSS OF VOLUME AS REGARDS LOCAL GOVERNMENT ARE NOT THE MUNICIPALITIES AND THE STATES THEMSELVES EXERCISING POWERS WHICH THEY DID NOT EXERCISE A FEW YEARS AGO WE SEE THEM TURNING THEIR ATTENTION TO SUCH THINGS AS MUNICIPAL OWNERSHIP OF WATER GAS AND ELECTRIC LIGHT TO THE OPERATION OF STREET RAILWAYS AND TO HOUSING WE FIND THEM ENTERING A MUCH LESS QUESTIONABLE FIELD THAN THE ABOVE SUCH AS THE PROVISION OF FREE PUBLIC BATHS WADING POOLS OUTDOOR GYMNASIUMS AND MUSIC UNDER THE POLICE POWERS THEY ARE MULTIPLYING SANI TARY MEASURES INCLUDING MILK INSPECTION AND PURE FOOD LAWS THE SUPPRESSION OF SMOKE IN CITIES AND ARE EVEN DEALING WITH THE UNSIGHTLY IN THE FORM OF OBJECTIONABLE BILLBOARDS IN THE FIELD OF EDUCATION THE INCREASE OF LOCAL ACTIVITY IS ENORMOUS CROWNING THE COMMON SCHOOL SYSTEM WE SEE TODAY MANY FLOURISHING STATE UNIVERSITIES AND EVEN CITY UNIVERSITIES AS IN CINCINNATI AND NEW YORK CORN TRAINS ARE BRINGING TO THE FARMERS DOOR RESULTS OF SCIENTIFIC WORK AT STATE AGRICULTURAL STATIONS AND FOR SOME YEARS WE WITNESSED A STATE ACTUALLY 38AMENDMENT OF THE SHERMAN ANTITRUST LAW ENGAGED IN THE SALE OF LIQUOR AN EXAMPLE OF A NEW MUNICIPAL ACTIVITY OF GREAT VALUE IS THE SALE OF MILK FOR INFANTS EXTENDING TO ITS FREE DISTRIBUTION WHERE NECESSARY IN SOME OF THESE ACTIVITIES THERE IS NOTHING WHATEVER TO PREVENT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WORKING SIDE BY SIDE IF THERE IS ANY ONE THING THAT CAN AND SHOULD BE CENTRALIZED IT IS THE COLLECTION AND DISSEMINATION OF KNOWLEDGE WITHOUT A CENTRAL ORGANIZATION THERE IS DANGER OF GREAT WASTE THROUGH PARALLEL EFFORT IN EXPERIMENT AND IN COLLECTING DATA AND CORRESPONDING WASTE IN DISSEMINATION AS A PEOPLE WE HAVE MADE UP OUR MINDS ONCE FOR ALL THAT VAST EMPIRE SUCH AS OUR HOME AREA ALONE CONSTITUTES TODAY CAN BE MAINTAINED ONLY IF BASED UPON HEALTHY LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUT WE ARE EQUALLY DETERMINED NOT TO BE SO FOOLISH AS TO ENDANGER THE SYSTEM BY CARRYING IT TO EXTREME E G BY DENYING TO THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT POWER OVER PROBLEMS WHICH IT ALONE CAN DEAL WITH SUC CESSFULLY A FURTHER OBJECTION OF JUDGE GROSSCUPS TO THIS BILL IS THAT IT LACKS THE HUMAN ELEMENT NOW WHAT DOES JUDGE GROSSCUP MEAN BY THE HUMAN ELEMENT FROM THE REST OF HIS WONDERFULLY ABLE ADDRESS I GATHER THAT HE MEANS ACTUAL PARTNERSHIP ON THE PART OF LABOR IN ALL THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH LABOR IS ENGAGED WELL ROBERT OWEN HAD HIS DREAMS ABOUT THIS A CENTURY AGO HOW FAR HAVE THEY BEEN FOUND PRACTICABLE BEFORE I GO ON I WANT TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN COOPERATIVE PRODUCTION AND COOPERATIVE DISTRIBUTION THE LATTER OFFERS LESS DIFFICULTIES THAN THE FORMER THE TROUBLE WITH COOPERATIVE PRO DUCTION IS THAT WHILE IT MAY WORK BEAUTIFULLY IN PROSPEROUS TIMES IT FAILS UTTERLY IN HARD TIMES WHEN THE LABORERS DIVIDENDS ARE REDUCED HE WANTS TO KNOW WHY AN EARLY RESULT BEING A DEMAND ON THE PART OF LABOR FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE MANAGEMENT NOW PRO DUCTIVE INDUSTRY IS IN ITS NATURE AUTOCRATIC THE NUMBER OF FAIL URES IN THE BUSINESS WORLD SHOWS HOW RARE IS THE TALENT THAT CAN HANDLE BIG BUSINESS OPERATIONS SUCCESSFULLY AND IF YOU CROWD THIS TALENT ASIDE THE RESULT WILL BE A LOSS OF INTELLIGENT DIRECTION I E GREATER LABOR WITH LESS RESULT IF JUDGE GROSSCUP HAD SAID PROFITSHARING THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE ANOTHER THING YOU MAY HAVE AN INSTITUTION LIKE A GREAT DEPART MENT STORE WHERE EVERY SALESMAN GETS A SHARE OF THE PROFITS AND THAT MAY BE PERMANENT BECAUSE THE SALESMAN HAS NO CERTIFICATE OF 39THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY PROPERTY WHICH HE CAN PART WITH OR ON WHICH HE CAN MAKE A LEGAL OR MORAL DEMAND FOR INTERFERENCE SO LONG AS HE CONTINUES IN THAT ESTABLISHMENT HE ENJOYS A SHARE OF THE PROFITS ACCORDING TO HIS SALES BUT EVEN IN COOPERATIVE DISTRIBUTION IF YOU ATTEMPT TO MAKE HIM PART OWNER WHAT HAPPENS SUPPOSING TODAY IN MR WANAMAKERS ESTABLISHMENT EACH EMPLOYEE SHOULD BE GIVEN CERTIFICATES OF STOCK HOW LONG WOULD ALL THE EMPLOYEES IN THAT ESTABLISHMENT CONTINUE TO BE HOLDERS OF THAT STOCK  WOULD NOT SOME OF THEM SELL ITHAVE TO SELL IT WOULD NOT OTHERS THROUGH THEIR SUPERIOR THRIFT GATHER IT TO THEMSELVES SO THAT AS IN MOST OF THE SOCALLED COOPERATIVE STORES TODAY YOU WOULD SOON HAVE THE FEW THRIFTY EMPLOYEES OWNING ALL THE STOCK AND BECOMING EMPLOYERS WHILE THE GREAT MASS OF FORMER STOCKHOLDERS HAD LAPSED INTO SALARIED EMPLOYEES THE DIFFICULTY IS INHERENT THERE ARE SOME THINGS WHICH ARE DEPENDENT ON TIME AND PLACE BUT TO MY MIND THE PARTICIPATION OF LABOR AS AN OWNER IN PRODUCTIONNOT IN SHARING PROFITS BUT AS AN ACTUAL OWNERIS INHERENTLY IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE IT INVOLVES INTER FERENCE WITH THE MANAGEMENT WHICH IS IN ITS VERY NATURE AUTO CRATIC NOW JUDGE GROSSCUP LIKEWISE REFERRED TO THE TREMENDOUS CON CENTRATION OF INDUSTRY IN THE HANDS OF A FEW MEN SOME OF US AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS MOVEMENT SAID THAT WHILE YOU WOULD HAVE GREAT FIELDS OF INDUSTRY GATHERED UP BY A FEW MEN THE NET RESULT PROVIDED ALWAYS THERE IS ADEQUATE REGULATIONI LAY DOWN THAT ONE CONDITION PROVIDED YOU HAVE ADEQUATE REGULATIONTHE NET RESULT WOULD BE LESS WASTE OF HUMAN ENERGY I E CHEAPER THINGS OR BETTER THINGS FOR THE SAME MONEY SO THAT IN THE LONG RUN HUMAN EFFORT WOULD BE MORE AND MORE FREED FROM THE NECESSITY OF PRODUCING THE MATERIAL THINGSTHE THINGS WHICH ENABLE MEN TO EXISTAND BE SET FREE FOR THE HIGHER THINGS THE THINGS WHICH ENABLE MEN TO LIVE NOW WHAT ARE THE INDICATIONS STATISTICS OF I900 COMPARED WITH I89O SHOW INCREASE OF DIFFUSION AND DESPITE THE CAUTION OF THE CENSUS BUREAU THAT THIS SHOWING IS DUE TO COMPLETER CANVASS SOME VERY GOOD AUTHORITIES BELIEVE THAT THE DIFFUSION IS REAL THE STATIS TICS OF MANUFACTURES FOR I905 THROW NO LIGHT WHATEVER ON THE TEN DENCY IN QUESTION FOR THE REASON THAT THEY EXCLUDE THE BULK OF THE SMALLER NEIGHBORHOOD AND MECHANICAL INDUSTRIES THREEFIFTHS OF ALL THE GRIST MILLS AND NEARLY ONETHIRD OF ALL THE LUMBER MILLS IN THE COUNTRY FOR EXAMPLE BEING THROWN OUT FROM THE ENUMERATION AND 40AMENDMENT OF THE SHERMAN ANTITRUST LAW FOR THE FURTHER REASON THAT THE CENSUS DOES NOT PRETEND TO INCLUDE THE PROFESSIONS INDUSTRIES WHICH LEND THEMSELVES TO COMBINATION ARE NOT LIKELY EVER TO BE BROKEN UP UNLESS THE LEGISLATOR DELIBERATELY SETS TO WORK TO HAMPER THEM ON THE CONTRARY MEANS ARE LIKELY TO BE FOUND FROM TIME TO TIME TO SUCCESSFULLY COMBINE INDUSTRIES WHICH PERHAPS CANNOT BE COMBINED TODAY THE POINT IS THAT THIS VERY PROCESS AIDED BY THE GROWING CONQUEST OF NATURE IN EVERY DIRECTION WILL SO CHEAPEN PRODUCTION AS TO SET FREE THE ACTIVITIES OF A LARGE BODY OF THE PEOPLE AS ALREADY STATED FOR HIGHER PURSUITS THESE HIGHER PURSUITS MAY TAKE THE FORM EITHER OF HANDIWORK TO WHICH SOME FEEL ING AND CHARACTER WILL BE IMPARTED BY THE INDIVIDUAL WORKMAN A DEMAND FOR WHICH IS LIKELY TO BE BROUGHT ABOUT BY GROWING WEALTH AND CULTURE OR OF IMPORTANT ACCESSIONS TO THE PROFESSIONS YOU MAY HAVE MORE SCHOOL TEACHERS PAINTERS AND SCULPTORS MORE MEN TO LET IMAGINATION RANGE IN THE WALKS OF LETTERS MORE MEN TO DEVOTE THEIR TIME TO THE SCIENCE OF GOVERNMENT WE ALL REALIZE THE MANY DRAWBACKS THAT HAVE COME WITH THE FACTORY SYSTEM THE TENDENCY TO WHICH REFERENCE HAS BEEN MADE WILL OFFSET THESE DISADVANTAGES WHILE THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT THIS TENDENCY HAS ALREADY SET IN IT WILL NATURALLY BE A LONG TIME POSSIBLY SEVERAL GENERATIONS BEFORE IT WILL BECOME IMPORTANT THIS IS PERHAPS AN OPTIMISTIC VIEW BUT IT IS AN OPTIMISM WHICH I BELIEVE TO BE BASED ON A CORRECT READING OF HUMAN HISTORY WHEN WE ANALYZE MONOPOLY WE FIND IT OF THREE PRINCIPAL KINDS THAT WHICH HAS BEEN TERMED MONOPOLY OF EXCELLENCE WHICH IS BETTER OR CHEAPER SERVICE AND GOODS MONOPOLY BASED UPON GOVERN MENT FAVOR SUCH AS A PATENT OR FRANCHISE AND MONOPOLY BASED UPON CONTROL OF THE SUPPLY OF THE RAW MATERIAL NO OTHER FORM OF MON OPOLY CAN BE PERMANENT NOW PUBLICITY WILL GO A LONG WAY TOWARD DEALING WITH THE ABUSES PRACTICED BY THESE MONOPOLIES EVEN MONOPOLY WHICH STARTS AS MONOPOLY OF EXCELLENCE MAY AFTER IT HAS CLEARED THE FIELD OF RIVALS RESORT TO EXACTIONS AND BECOME OPPRESSIVE IT THEN BECOMES THE DUTY OF THE STATE TO REINTRODUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF COMPETITION BY MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR THE MONOPOLY TO CUT PRICES IN A RESTRICTED AREA WITH A VIEW TO KILLING OFF INCIPIENT COMPETITION WHILE MAKING LARGE PROFITS FROM A MAINTENANCE OF PRICE ELSEWHERE WE ARE PROB ABLY NOT YET PREPARED TO SAY TO THE INDUSTRIAL CORPORATIONS THAT 4ITHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY THEY MUST FOLLOW THE RULE OF PUBLIC UTILITIES AND HAVE ONE PRICE FOR ALL COMERS BUT IF BY PUBLICITY WE CAN SHOW GREAT DISCRIMINATION IN PRICE PUBLIC OPINION IS LIKELY IN THE LONG RUN TO SUCCEED IN BREAK ING UP THE PRACTICE FOR MONOPOLY BASED UPON GOVERNMENT FAVOR THE OBVIOUS REMEDY IS FORESIGHT I E PROPER CONDITIONS LAID DOWN WHEN THE FRANCHISE OR PATENT IS GRANTED THE THIRD KIND OF MONOPOLY THAT BASED UPON CONTROL OF THE SUPPLY OF RAW MATERIALS IS THE MOST DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH POSSIBLY THERE IS NO REMEDY FOR IT EXCEPT GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP UNDER WHICH SUCH THINGS AS MINES COULD BE LEASED ON A ROYALTY NOT OPERATED BY THE GOVERNMENT SUCH A SYSTEM WOULD PLACE THE GOVERNMENT IN CONTROL OF THE SITUATION AND PUBLICITYTHE PUBLICITY WE ARE SEEKING TO SET UP UNDER THE HEPBURN BILLWOULD SHOW EXACTLY WHAT ARE THE PROB LEMS WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH TO AMEND THE SHERMAN LAW BY SIM PLY INSERTING THE WORD UNREASONABLE WOULD ACCOMPLISH SOME OF THE OBJECTS AIMED AT BY THE PRESENT BILL BUT WE WOULD BE THROWING AWAY THE OPPORTUNITY TO SECURE PUBLICITY OF A LARGE KIND TO SECURE IT IN A NEGATIVE WAYNOT COMPULSORYAND UNDER A SYSTEM WHICH WOULD BE AUTOMATIC AND WOULD NOT DEPEND ON THE INITIATIVE OF ANY DEPARTMENT OR OFFICIAL THIS DEVICE WOULD OF COURSE RESULT IN A MUCH GREATER VOLUME OF PUBLICITY THAN AT PRESENT AND THE OBJECTION THAT INFORMATION SO GIVEN TO THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT MIGHT BE SEIZED UPON BY THE SEPARATE STATES AND USED AS THE BASIS OF PROSECUTION UNDER STATE STATUTES IS A SERIOUS OBJECTION IT IS IN FACT THE ONE SERI OUS OBJECTION ADVANCED AGAINST THE BILL AN ANSWER TO IT HAS NOT YET BEEN FOUND AND IT IS HIGHLY DESIRABLE THAT ONE SHOULD BE FOUND BECAUSE THE SAME OBJECTION WOULD HOLD AGAINST ANY CONCEIVABLE PLAN OF PUBLICITY UNDER THE FEDERAL POWER 42

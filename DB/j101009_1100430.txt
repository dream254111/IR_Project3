OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS BOTH THE DIRECTORS AND THE OFFICERS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ACT AS AGENTS YET THE CHARACTER OF THEIR AGENCY IS QUITE DISSIMILAR THE ACTS OF THE DIRECTORS COME UNDER THE HEAD OF CORPORATE ACTS WHILE THOSE OF THE OFFICERS ARE SUBJECT TO THE GENERAL RULES OF THE AGENCY THE DIRECTORS OF A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION ACTING IN A FIDUCIARY EA PAPITY BEAR PRACTICALLY THE RELATIONSHIP OF TRUSTEES TO THE BANKS STOCKHOLDERS AND CREDITORS THAT WE MAY HAVE A MORE COMPREHEN SIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR LIABILITIES WE WILL CONSIDER FOR A FEW MINUTES THE SUBJECT OF THEIR DUTIES AND AUTHORITY AS IT IS A BREACH IN THE OBSERVANCE OF THESE POWERS WHICH MAKES THEM LIABLE THE GENERAL MANAGEMENT OF AN INSTITUTION IS VESTED IN ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO THEIR JUDGMENT IS ENTRUSTED ABSOLUTELY THE INVEST MENT OF ALL FUNDS AND THE SELECTION OF OFFICERS DIRECTORS HOWEVER HAVE NOT ANY INDIVIDUAL POWER IT IS NECES SARY THAT THEY CONVENE AND DELIBERATE TOGETHER AT A PROPERLY CALLED MEETING IN ORDER THAT THEIR ACTS MAY BE EFFECTIVE IT HAS BEEN HELD IN NEW HAMPSHIRE THAT WHERE THE CASHIER OF A BANK RECEIVED THE SEPARATE ASSENT OF THE MAJORITY OF THE BOARD AUTHORIZING HIM TO EN DORSE A NOTE THE BANK WAS NOT BOUND BY THE ENDORSEMENT AS SUCH SEPARATE ACTION WAS NOT EFFECTIVE THE LAW OF THAT STATE PROHIBITING SUCH ACTION ON THE PART OF THE CASHIER EXCEPT BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IT MAY BE STATED AS A GENERAL RULE THAT THERE MUST BE A MAJORITY OF THE BOARD PRESENT IN ORDER THAT THE BUSINESS TO BE TRANSACTED MAY BE EFFECTUAL IN SOME STATES THERE AXE EXCEPTIONS TO THIS RULE IT BEING PROVIDED THAT A NUMBER OF DIRECTORS LESS THAN A MAJORITY OF THE BOARD MAY FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES CONVENE AND EFFECTIVELY TRANSACT BUSINESS BUT WITHOUT SUCH POWER A MAJORITY WOULD BE ACTING SOLELY AS INDIVIDUALS ACTING IN THEIR FIDUCIARY CAPACITY THEY MUST NOT BE INTERESTED ADVERSELY IN MATTERS UPON WHICH THEY PASS JUDGMENT CONTRACTS BE TWEEN THE INSTITATION AND ONE OR MORE OF ITS DIRECTORS WHILE PERMIS SIBLE EXCEPT WHERE THE LAW EXPRESSLY PROHIBITS SUCH RELATIONSHIP WILL BE SET ASIDE ON THE SLIGHTEST GROUNDS184 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER JULY LOAN CONTRACTS HAVE BY CUSTOM BECOME SO FREQUENT THAT THEY ARE LIOT SCRUTINIZED WITH AS JEALOUS AN EYE ALTHOUGH THEY SEEM TO BE AN EVASION OF THE GENERAL RULE RELATING TO THE AUTHORITY OF DIRECTORS TO CONTRACT WITH THEIR BANKS THERE IS CONSIDERABLE CONFLICT OF OPINION AS TO WHAT CONSTITUTES A STANDARD BY WHICH THE ACTS OF DIRECTORS SHALL BE MEASURED IN SOME JURISDICTIONS THE INQUIRY IS HAVE THE DIRECTORS EXERCISED THAT DILI GENCE AND CARE NECESSARY TO A THOROUGHLY SUCCESSFUL DISCHARGE OF THE DUTIES IMPOSED UPON THEM IN CASES WHERE THE MOST ASSIDUOUS ATTENTION IS REQUIRED THE DIRECTORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SLIGHTEST NEGLECT IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS IT HAS BEEN HELD THAT THE DIRECTORS ARE ONLY REQUIRED TO EXERCISE THE SAME DEGREE OF CARE WHICH WOULD DISTINGUISH THE ACTS OF A REASONABLY PRUDENT MAN IN THE MANAGE MENT OF HIS BUSINESS AFFAIRS A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE MAXIMUM LIABILITY RULE WHICH HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY FOLLOWED IN OTHER STATES CAN BE HAD FROM A NEW Y7ORK DECISION BY JUSTICE EARLE IN WHICH HE STATED THAT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IT WOULD BE A MOST MONSTROUS PROPOSITION TO HOLD THAT TRUSTEES INTRUSTED WITH THE MANAGEMENT OF THE PROPERTY INTERESTS AND BUSINESS OF OTHER PEOPLE WHO DIVEST THEMSELVES OF THE MANAGE MENT AND CONFIDE IN THEM ARE BOUND TO GIVE ONLY SLIGHT CARE TO TLLE DUTIES OF THEIR TRUST AND ARE LIABLE ONLY IN CASE OF GROSS INATTENTION AND NEGLIGENCE I HAVE FOUND NO AUTHORITY FULLY UPHOLDING SUCH A PROPOSITION WE FREQUENTLY FIND DIRECTORS ENDEAVORING TO AVOID THEIR LIABILITV BY SHOWING THAT AT THE TIME THE BUSINESS COMPLAINED OF WAS TRANS ACTED THEY WERE ABSENT FROM THE INSTITUTION THE SUFFICIENCY OF THIS DEFENSE IS ENTIRELY INADEQUATE IF IT APPEARS THAT THE ABSENCE OF THE DIRECTOR WAS DUE TO SOME KNOWLEDGE OR BELIEF THAT THE AFFAIRS OF THE BANK WERE NOT BEING CONDUCTED IN A PROPER MANNER IN SUCH CASES HE WILL BE CONSIDERED A PASSIVE PARTICIPANT WE ALL KNOW THAT IT IS COMPULSORY UPON A DIRECTOR THAT HE QUALIFYT AS SUCH AND ONE OF THE USUAL REQUISITES IS THAT HE SHALL MAKE OATL TO HIS BEING OWNER OF A GIVEN NUMBER OF SHARES OF THE STOCK OF THE BANK AND THAT THE SAME IS NOT HYPOTHECATED OR PLEDGED AS SECURITY AN OATH WRONGFULLY MADE WITH FALSE INTENT RENDERS THE OFFENDER GUILTY OF PERJURY AND SUBJECTS HIM TO A CRIMINAL PROSECUTION DIRECTORS OFTEN INVOLVE THEMSELVES UNNECESSARILY TO AN ACCOUNT ABLE DEGREE BY INDULGING THE DESIRE TO INCREASE THE PROFITS OF THE1904 LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS 185 BANK TO THE GREATEST POSSIBLE EXTENT THIS QUITE FREQUENTLY RESULTS IN CASES WHERE IN ORDER TO SECURE A GREATER RATE OF INTEREST THE LAWS OF USUARY ARE TOTALLY DISREGARDED IN SUCH CASES IT HAS BEEN HELD THAT IT IS REASONABLE TO PRESUME THAT THEY HAVE NOT SELECTED THE BEST CLASS OF SECURITY AND IN SO DOING HAVE PLACED THEMSELVES BEYOND THE PROTECTION OF THE LAW EVEN THOUGH THEIR ACTIONS HAVE BEEN PURE LY UNSELFISH IT BEING CONSIDERED THAT THEY HAVE WANTONLY BROKEN THE LAWS WHICH WERE ENACTED TO PREVENT THEM FROM TAKING EXCESSIVE RISKS THE RECEIVING OF DEPOSITS BY DIRECTORS WHEN THEIR BANK IS IN AN IN SOLVENT CONDITION IS SUFFICIENT TO MAKE THEM PERSONALLY LIABLE PRO VIDED THEV KNEW OF THE INSOLVENCY OF THE INSTITUTION AT THE TIME OF RECEIVING SUCH DEPOSITS IF THEIR LACK OF KNOWLEDGE IN THIS RE SPECT IS DUE TO A DISREGARD OF THEIR DUTIES THEN THEY WILL NOT BE RELEASED A SIMILAR ACCOUNTABILITY IS CREATED BY LENDING THE FUNDS OF THE BANK IN A GREATER PERCENTAGE THAN IS PRESCRIBED BY LAW MANY DIRECTORS HAVE BEEN ASKED TO ACCOUNT IN DAMAGES FOR DE CLARING DIVIDENDS WHEN NOT EARNED AN ADEQUATE DEFENSE CONSISTS IN ESTABLISHING PROOF THAT THE DIVIDEND WAS DECLARED THROUGH AN ERROR IN JUDGMENT AS TO THE NET EARNINGS OF THE BANK THE MAKING OF FALSE STATEMENTS AS TO THE SOLVENCY OF THEIR INSTI TLTION ESTABLISHES A RIGHT OF DAMAGES TO THOSE RELYING UPON SUCH STATEMENTS IF THEY HAVE SUFFERED A LOSS FOR EXAMPLE WHERE DEPOSITS HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE INSTITUTION OR ITS STOCK PURCHASED BY THOSE SO NMISLED THE RIGHT ON THE PART OF THE DIRECTORS TO DELEGATE THEIR AUTHORITY TO OTHERS AND TO WHAT EXTENT THEY MAY DO SO IS NOT GOVERNED BY A UNIFORM RULE IN SOME STATES THEY ARE PERMITTED TO DELEGATE THEIR AUTHORITY TO ONE OR MORE OF THE OFFICERS OF THE INSTITUTION TO MAKE LOANS IN OTHER STATES THIS PRIVILEGE IS DENIED TO THEM AND IN SUCH STATES A LOSS RESULTING FROM SUCH DELEGATION OF THEIR POWER AND DUTY RENDERS THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO THEIR BANK IN THE EXERCISE OF THEIR PREROGATIVE OF APPOINTING THE OFFICERS OF THEIR INSTITUTION THE DIRECTORS DO NOT BECOME SURETY FOR THE FIDELITY OF THEIR APPOINTEES UNLESS THEY HAVE SELECTED SOME ONE KNOWN TO THEM TO BE DISHONEST OR OF A NOTORIOUSLY BAD CHARACTER WHEN DIRECTORS RETAIN A DEFAULTING OFFICER IN THE EMPLOV OF THE INSTITUTION AFTER THEY BECOME COGNIZANT OF SUCH DEFAULT  THEY186 1 0 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER JULY BECOME LIABLE FOR ALL LOSSES WHICH THE BANK MAY SUFFER FROM THE TIME WHEN THE DEFICIENCY BECAME KNOWN TO THEM AND TO THAT EXTENT THE DEFAUILTING OFFICERS SURETY IS RELEASED IT HAS BEEN QUITE FREQUENTLY HELD THAT ALL OFFICERS FOUND ENGAGED IN STOCK GAMBLING SHOULD BE IMMEDIATELY DISMISSED I AM OF THE OPINION THAT DIRECTORS SUBJECT THEMSELVES TO PERSONAL LIABILITY IN FAILING TO COMPLY WITH THIS REQUIREMENT FRAUDULENT ACTS OF OFFICERS CANNOT BE CONDONED BY THE BOARD OF DI RECTORS AS SUCH A POWER VESTED IN THEM WOULD PLACE ANY OFFICER WHO CONTROLLED HIS BOARD IN A POSITION TO ROB HIS INSTITUTION WITH IM PUNITY HAVING BRIEFLY ANALVZED THE LIABILITIES OF DIRECTORS IT WOULD BE WELL FOR US TO PREFACE OUR DISCUSSION OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF IN DIVIDUAL OFFICERS WITH A CURSORY INSIGHT INTO THE ACTS FOR WHICH OF FICERS IN GENERAL ARE ACCOUNTABLE OFFICERS IN GENERAL OF A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION SERVE IN THE CAPACITY OF AGENTS FOR IT THEY DERIVE THEIR AUTHORITY TO SO ACT EITHER FROM THE CHARTER UNDER WHICH THE BANK EXISTS ITS BYLAWS OR FROM POWER DELEGATED TO THEM BY THE DIRECTORS THEY CANNOT SUBJECT THEIR IN STITUTIONS TO LIABILITY BY MAKING AN ULTRA VIRES CONTRACT IN OTHER WORDS THEY CANNOT BIND THEIR BANK IN MAKING A CONTRACT WHICH IS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF ITS CORPORATE POWERS OFFICERS ARE NOT LIABLE TO THE SAME DEGREE AS ARE THE DIRECTORS THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR CONDUCT IS USUALLY CONFINED TO FRAUDULENT OR MALICIOUS ACTS AND NOT TO MERE NONFEASANCE THEY ARE LIABLE FOR LOSSES INCURRED BY THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN IN DUCED THROUGH THEIR FALSE STATEMENTS AS TO THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE BANK TO DEPOSIT THEREIN OR TO PURCHASE STOCK THEREOF THEY ARE ALSO HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR SELLING OVER ISSUES OF STOCK WITH FRAUDULENT INTENT THE CLAIMANT MUST PROVE HOWEVER THAT THE CERTIFICATE ON WHICH SUIT IS BROUGHT WAS IMPROPERLY ISSUED THEY ARE NOT ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE DIMINUTION IN THE VALUE OF THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THEIR BANK UNLESS IT IS CLEARLY SHOWN THAT SUCH RE DUCTION HAS BEEN CAUSED SOLELY THROUGH THEIR WILFUL MISCONDUCT OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE IN CONSIDERING THEIR AUTHORITY IT IS HARDLY NECESSARY TO ADD THAT ANY ACT OF AN OFFICER WHICH IS INVALID UNDER THE BANKS CHARTER CAN NOT BE VALIDATED BY RATIFICATION NOR CAN AN OFFICER WHO HAS INTEN TIONALLY COMMITTED A WRONG DEFEND OR EXCUSE HIMSELF BY SHOWING1904 LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS 187 THAT HIS ACT WAS PERFORMED UNDER THE INSTRUCTIONS OF A SUPERIOR OF FICER THE LAWS ON THIS POINT BEING WELL SETTLED THAT ALL PERSONS DI RECTLY CONCERNED IN THE COMMISSION OF A FRAUD ARE TO BE TREATED AS PRINCIPALS LEAVING THE SUBJECT OF OFFICERS IN GENERAL WE WILL NOW TURN OUR ATTENTION TO TWO OFFICERS IN PARTICULAR NAMELY THE PRESIDENT AND THE CASHIER THE OFFICE OF TREASURER BEING TREATED UNDER THE HEAD OF CASHIER THE POWERS OF THE PRESIDENT ARE EXTREMELY LIMITED UNLESS EXTEND ED BY THE CHARTER OR BY AUTHORITY FROM THE GOVERNING BOARD OF WHICH HE IS THE EXECUTIVE AGENT THE PRESIDENT IS USUALLY REPRE SENTED TO THE PUBLIC AS HOLDING THE POSITION OF MANAGING OFFICER OF THE INSTITUTION WHICH CUSTOM HAS SO LARGELY EXTENDED HIS AUTHORITY THAT THE INSTITUTION IN SUCH CASES IS HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR SUCH OF HIS ACTS AS THE PUBLIC MAY BE JUSTIFIED IN BELIEVING TO BE VESTED IN HIM THE PRESIDENT HAS NOT INDIVIDUAL AUTHORITY TO CONVEY THE REAL PROPERTY OF HIS INSTITUTION AND HE IS IN LIKE MANNER DEBARTED FROM MORTGAGING THE SAME NOR CAN HE BIND HIS BANK BY AGREEING TO PAY A SUM WHICH IT DOES NOT OWE HE IS PROHIBITED FROM RELEASING WITH OUT DUE CONSIDERATION A JUDGMENT OR DEBT NOR HAS HE THE POWER TO CERTIFY HIS OWN CHECK HIS OBLIGATION SO CERTIFIED SHOWS ON ITS FACE SUCH A PALPABLE EXCESS OF AUTHORITY THAT THE BANK CANNOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS PAYMENT THE PRESIDENT IS LIABLE WHEN HE INCURS A LARGER INDEBTEDNESS ON BEHALF OF HIS INSTITUTION THAN HE IS PERMITTED TO HAVE BY LAW OR WHEN HE ALLOWS A PERSON WHOM HE KNOWS TO BE WHOLLY IRRESPONSIBLE TO DRAW FUNDS FROM HIS BANK WITHOUT REASONABLY ADEQUATE SECURITY THE PRESIDENT MAKES HIMSELF PERSONALLY LIABLE IF HE FAILS TO TAKE PROPER CARE OF THE SECURITIES OF HIS BANK FOR EXAMPLE HE BECOMES INDIVIDUALLY RESPONSIBLE BY LENDING TO CUSTOMERS OF THE BANK FOR INSPECTION VERIFICATION OR FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE SECURITIES HELD AS COLLATERAL IF IN SO DOING HE CAUSES THE BANK TO MEET WITH A LOSS THE DUTY OF INSTRUCTING THE OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES OF A BANK AS TO WHAT CONSTITUTE THEIR DUTIES DEVOLVES UPON THE PRESIDENT ESPE CIALLY THE DIRECTING OF THE PROPER EMPLOYEES NOT TO PAY AN INSTRU MENT WHICH IS IMPROPERLY DRAWN OR EXECUTED AND WHEN THROUGH HIS NEGLECT OF THIS OFFICE THE BANK SUFFERS A LOSS HE CAN BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE HE IS LIKEWISE RESPONSIBLE FOR A LOSS RESULTING FROM A FAILURE ON188 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER JULY HIS PART TO SEE THAT TRUSTED OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES OF HIS INSTITUTION GIVE BOND FOR THE FAITHFUL PERFORMANCE OF THEIR DUTIES THE DEGTEE OF CARE AND SUPERVISION EXPECTED OF THE PRESIDENT IS LARGELY DEPENDENT UPON THE COMPENSATION WHICH HE RECEIVES THE DEGREE OF VIGILANCE REQUIRED BEING LESS IN A CASE WHERE THE SALARY IS ONLY NOMINAL THAN IT IS IN A CASE WHERE HE IS REIMBURSED FOR THE EX PENDITURE OF HIS ENTIRE TIME FROMII A TIME WHEN THE MEMORY OF MAN RUNNETH NOT TO THE CON TRARY THE CASHIER OR TREASURER HAS BEEN REGARDED AS THE SECOND OF FICER OF A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION SUBJECT TO THE PRESIDENTS SUPERVISION FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT THE CASHIERS AUTHORITY EXCEEDS THAT OF THE PRESIDENT AS HE BEARS MORE THE RELATIONSHIP OF AGENT TO THE CORPORA TION THAN HE DOES TO THE DIRECTORS HE IS THE EXECUTIVE OF THE FINAN CIAL DEPARTMENT OF HIS BANK AND WHILE ACTING WITHIN THE SCOPE OF HIS AUTHORIZED POWERS HE BINDS HIS INSTITUTION ALTHOUGH HE HAS EX CEEDED HIS INSTRUCTIONS THE CASHIER AS AGENT IS SUBJECT TO PERSONAL LIABILITY FOR SUCH LOSS AS HIS PRINCIPAL HAS SUFFERED THROUGH FAILURE ON HIS PART TO EXERCISE REASONABLE SKILL AND ORDINARY CARE IN THE PERFORMANCE OF HIS DUTIES AND WHEN ITHERE IS EVIDENCE OF BAD FAITH PARTICULARLY IN THEGRANT INIG OF LOANS HE IS ESPECIALLY LIABLE FOR SUCH LOSS AS HIS BANK MAY INCUR THROUGH HIS ACT ALTHOUGH IT LIES WITHIN THE POWER OF THE CASHIER TO ISSUE CERTI FICATES OF DEPOSIT YET THE SAME RESTRICTIONS EXIST IN THIS INSTANCE AS GOVERN HIM IN THE CERTIFYING OF CHECKS HE IS NOT PERMITTED TO ISSUE A CERTIFICATE TO HIMSELF THEREFORE SUCH AN INSTRUMENT IS VOID ON ITS FACE IT BEING APPARENT TO ANY ONE THAT THE CASHIER IS ACTING IN A DUAL CAPACITY WHERE THE FUNDS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO WARRANT HIS ACTION HE MAKES HIMSELF PERSONALLY LIABLE TO THE BANK FOR ISSUING CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSITS ON CERTIFYING CHECKS HE INCURS A LIKE RESPONSIBILITY BY RELEASING A DEBTOR SURETY JUDGMENT OR MORTGAGE WITHOUT DUE CONSIDERATION HE IS NOT AL LOWED TO REVIVE A DEBT BARRED BY THE STATUTE OF LIMITATION OR PROMISE TO PAY A CHECK WHERE THE DRAWER AT THE TIME OF THE PROMISE HAD NOT PLACED WITH THE BANK SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO COVER THE AMOUNT HE CANNOT UNDERTAKE TO PAY A DEBT WHICH HIS BANK DOES NOTOWE THE CASHIER THOUGH REQUIRED TO USE REASONABLE DILIGENCE IN OB SERVING THE CONDLUCT AND WORK OF THOSE OFFICERS WHO COME UNDER HIIS1904 LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS 189 SUPERVISION IS NOT HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR HONESTY AND FIDELITY IT IS HARDLY NECESSARY TO ADD THAT EACH OFFICER IS INDIVIDUALLY LIABLE TO HIS BANK FOR SUCH LOSS AS IT MAY SUFFER BY REASON OF HIS FRAUDULENT ACTS AND THAT THESE WRONGS CANNOT BE CONDONED AS IT IS NOT WITHIN THE POWERS OF THE BOARD TO GRANT TO ANY OFFICER THE RIGHT TO PLUNDER THE FUNDS OF HIS INSTITUTION J HECTOR MCNEAL

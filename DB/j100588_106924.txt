J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,106924,EXPERIMENTS IN WHICH ON THE THIRD DAY AFTER IMPREGNATION THE OVA OF RABBITS WERE FOUND IN THE FALLOPIAN TUBES AND ON THE FOURTH DAY AFTER IMPREGNATION IN THE UTERUS ITSELF WITH THE FIRST APPEARANCES OF THE FOETUS BY WILLIAM CRUIKSHANK ESQ COMMUNICATED BY EVERARD HOME ESQ F R S,I206952,1 97 1 IX EXPERIMENTS IN WHICH ON THE THIRD DAY AFTER IMPREGNATION THE OVA OF RABBITS WERE FOUND IN THEFALLOPIAN TUBES AND ON THE FOULRTB DAY AFTER IMPREGNATION IN THE UTERUS ITSELF WITB THE FIRST APPEARANCES OF THE F TUS BY WILLIAM CRUIKSHANK ESQ COMMUNICATED BY EVERARD HOME ESQ F R S READ MARCH 23 1797 THE ANCIENTS IMAGINED THAT THE WOMAN HAD HER TESTICLES AS WELL AS THE MAN AND HER OWN SEMEN THEY TAUGHT THATI IN THE COITUS THERE WAS A MIXTURE OF THE MALE AND FEMALE SEMEN IN THE UTERUS AND THAT FROM A PROCESS LIKE FERMENTATION BE TWEEN THOSE TWO FLUIDS AN EMBRYO WAS PRODUCED LEWENHOECK SAID THE EMBRYO BELONGED TO THE MALE AND SAW OR THOUGHT HE SAW ANIMALCULES IN THE MALE SEMEN RESEMBLING THE ANI MALS TO WHICH THEY BELONGED SPALLANZANI SAYS THAT THE SEMEN OF MALE ANIMALS HAVING NO ANIMALCULES IMPREGNATES AS CERTAINLY AS THAT OF THOSE WHICH HAVE THEM THIS SHOWS THAT THOSE ANIMALCULES ARE NOT EMBRYOS STENO OBSERVING THAT THERE WERE ROUND VESICLES IN THE TESTICLES OF WOMEN LIKE THE EGGS OF BIRDS CALLED THEM OVARIA AND SAID THEIR STRUCTURE WAS EXACTLY SIMILAR TO THE OVARIA OF BIRDS AFTER THIS THE IMMORTAL HARVEY BROACHED THE DOCTRINE OF OMNIA AB OVO  THAT ALL ANIMALS WERE PRODUCED FROM OVA NOS AUTEM ASSERIMUS ANIMALIA OMNIA ET HOMINEM IPSURN EX QUIBUSDAM OVIS NASCI THE OVA IN THE OVARIA OF RABBITS ARE PARTICULARLY DESCRIBED BY DE GRAAF WHENCE HALLER CALLS THEM OVA GRAFFIANA198 MR CRUIRSHANLKS EXPERIMENTS BUT THE OVARIA OF QUADRUPEDS OFTEN CONTAIN VESICLES OF THE HY DATID KIND AND IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN WHAT ARE VESICLES AND WHAT ARE OVA THE MARK WITH ME IS THIS THE OVA ARE INCLOSED IN A CAPSULE HIGHLY VASCULAR FROM ARTERIES AND VEINS CARRYING RED BLOOD THE HYDATID VESICLES ARE NOT VASCULAR AT LEAST THEIR VESSELS CARRY NO RED BLOOD THE CALYX AND THE OVUM AFTER IMPREGNATION AND EVEN BEFORE IT IN THE STATE IN WHICH THE QUADRUPED IS SAID TO BE HOT BE COME BLACK AS INK FROM THE GREATER DERIVATION OF BLOOD AND THE OVA RESEMBLE DARK SPOTS THEY ALSO COME NEARER THE SUR FACE OF THE OVARIUM SO AS TO POUT OR PROJECT AT LAST LIKE THE NIPPLE IN A WOMANS BREAST SOME HOURS AFTER IMPREGNATION THE CALYX AND THE COVERINGS OF THE OVARIA BURST AND THE OVUM ESCAPES MAY FALL INTO THE GENERAL CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN AND FORM AN EXTRAUTERINE FOETUS BUT LMST ALWAYS FALLS INTO THE MOUTH OF THE FALLOPIAN TUBE WHOSE FIMBRIX LIKE FINGERS GRASP THE OVARIUM EXACTLY AT THE PLACE WHERE THE OVUM IS TO ESCAPE WHAT THE APPEARANCE OF THE OVUM WAS WHEN DEPRIVED OF  ITS CALYX OR WHEN DESCENDING THE FALLOPIAN TUBE FFWAS NOT KNOWN DE GRAAF DISCOVERED THIS IN THE FALLOPIAN TUBES OF

EXPERIMENTS NOW THAT LECTURES ARE OVER AND THAT I HAVE THE SUMMER TO MYSELF YOU SHALL MAKE THEEXPIV MENTS SAID HE C AND I SHALL BE AT ALL THE EXPENCE AC CORDINGLY HE CARRIED ME TO CHELSEA INTRODUCED  ME TO A MAN WHO KEPT A RABBIT WARREN AND DESIRED HIM TO LET ME HAVE  AS MANY RABBITS AS I PLEASED I MADE THE EXPERIMENTS AND SHALL NOW LAY A COPY OF MY JOURNAL THEN MADE BEFORE THIS SOCIETY EXPERIMENT I MAY 3O 1778 I TOOK A FEMALE RABBIT HOT AS THE FEERS TERM IT THAT IS READY TO BE IMPREGNATED AND DISPOSED TO RE CEIVE THE MALE THIS THEY FIND OUT NOT BY EXPOSING HER TO THE MALE BUT BY TURNING UP THE TAIL AND INVERTING PART OF THE VAGINA ITS ORIFICE AND INTERNAL SURFACE ARE THEN AS BLACK AS INK FROM THE GREAT DERIVATION OF BLOOD TO THESE PARTS HAVING RUN THE POINT OF A DOUBLEEDGED DISSECTING KNIFE THROUGH THE SPINAL MARROW BETWEEN THE ATLAS AND DENTATA SHE INSTANTLY EXPIRED I PREFERRED THIS METHOD OF KILLING HER BECAUSE WHEN THE CIRCULATION STOPPED THE INTERNAL PARTSWOULD BE FOUND RESPECTING VASCULARITY EXACTLY AS IN THE LIVING BODY UPON EXAMINATION SOME TIME AFTER I FOUND THE INTERNAL PARTS OF20O MR CRUIKSHANKS EXPERIMENTS GENERATION EXACTLY IN THE SAME STATE AS THE EXTERNAL THAT IS AS BLACK AS INK  THE OVARIA HAD IMMEDIATELY UNDER THEIR EX TERNAL SURFACES A GREAT NUMBER OF BLACK ROUND BLOODY SPOTS SOMEWHAT LESS THAN MUSTARD SEEDS THESE BLACK SPOTS ARE THE CALYCES OR CUPS WHICH SECRETE THE OVA THEY ARE EXTREMELY VASCULAR  THE OVA THEMSELVES CARE TRANSPARENT AND CARRY NO VISIBLE BLOOD VESSELS THESE CALYCES ON THE EXPULSION OF THE OVA ENLARGE AND BECOME YELLOW PROJECTING ABOVE THE EXTERNAL SURFACE OF THE OVARIA AND FORM THE CORPORA LUTEA A CERTAIN MARK OF CONCEPTION IN ALL QUADRUPEDS AND IN WOMEN THEM SELVES WHETHER THE EMBRYO IS VISIBLE OR NOT THE USE OF THE CORPORA LUTEA IS NOT YET MADE BUT BUT THE ORIFICE THROUGH WHICH THE OVUM BURSTS INTO THE FALLOPIAN TUBE IS OFTEN EX TREMELY MANIFEST AND ALWAYS HAS A RAGGED BORDER AS LACERATED PARTS USUALLY HAVE THE FALLOPIAN TUBES INDEPENDENT OF THEIR BLACK COLOUR WERE TWISTED LIKE WREATHING WORMS THE PERI STALTIC MOTION STILL REMAINING VERY VIVID THE FIMBRIAE WERE ALSO BLACK AND EMBRACED THE OVARIA LIKE FINGERS LAYING HOLD OF AN OBJECT SO CLOSELY AND SO FIRMLY AS TO REQUIRE SOME FORCE AND EVEN SLIGHT LACERATION TO DISENGAGE THEM EXPERIMENT II I OPENED A FEMALE RABBIT TWO HOURS AFTER SHE RECEIVED THE MALE THE BLACK BLOODY SPOTS JUST MENTIONED NOW PROJECTED MUCH ABOVE THE SURFACES OF THE OVARIA SOME OF THE RUPTURED ORIFICES WERE JUST VISIBLE BUT IN MANY OF THESE SPOTS THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST VESTIGE OF AN ORIFICE WHENCE I CONCLUDE THAT THEY HEAL VERY QUICKLY IN GENERAL WHILE THE ANIMAL WAS YET WARM I INJECTED THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM WITH SIZE COLOURED WITH VERMILION WHENCE EVERY THING I HAD BEFORE SEEN BECAME NOWTO DISOVER THE OVA OF RABBITS 01 MORE DISTINCT AND THE BLACK SPOTS WHICH I BEFORE CONJECTURED TO BE CONGERIES OF VESSELS WERE NOW PROVED TO BE SO EXPERIMENT III I OPENED AANOTHER FEMALE RABBIT THE THIRD DAY AFTER IMPREG NATION THAT SHE WAS IMPREGNATED I COULD HAVE NO DOUBT FOR I NEVER KNEW IMPREGNATION FAIL IF THE FEMALE WAS HOT AND THE MALE HAD NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY EXHAUSTED BESIDES THE CORPORA LUTEA IN THE OVARIA FULLY PROVED IT THE APPEARANCES WERE THE SAME AS IN THE LAST ONLY THE CORPORA LUTEA WERE LARGER BUT THOUGH I EXAMINEDJTHE FALLOPIANT TUBES IN THE SUNSHINE AND WITH GREAT CARE JI COULD NOT FIND ANY OVA NEITHER IN THEM NOR IN THE HORNS OF THE UTERUS EXPERIMENT IV I OPENED ANOTHER FEMALE RABBIT THE FIFTH DAY AFTER CONCEP TION THE APPEARANCES WERE MUCH THE SAME AS IN THE FORMER ANIMAL ONLY THE CORPORA LUTEA WERE INCREASED IN BULK BUT THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST VESTIGE OF AN OVUM ANY WHERE THATI COULD DISCOVER I WAS NOW READY TO EXCLAIM WIITH HALLER VIX LICEAT ADMITTERE EXPERIMENT V I OPENED ANOTHER FEMALE RABBIT ON THE EIGHTH DAY AFTER SHE HAD ADMITTED THE MALE THE OVA WERE IN THE CAVITY OF THE UTE RUS AND PROJECTED THROUGH ITS SUBSTANCE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A LARGE GARDEN PEA WHEN I CUT OFF THE MOST SUPERIOR PART AND CUT INTO THE CAVITIES OF THE OVA THE LIQUOR AMNII ESCAPED IN A PROPORTIONATE QUANTITY BY THEIR ADHESIONS TO THE INTERNAL SUR FACE OF THE UTERUS THEY REMAINED EXTENDED NOT COLLAPSING IN MDCCXCVII D D2O2 MR CRUIKSHANKS EXPERIMENTS THE SMALLEST DEGREE THE FOETUS WAS NOT VISIBLE BUT I HAD OFTEN MADE THE CHICK IN MY EXPERIMENTS ON THE INCUBATED EGG BE COME VISIBLE BY DROPPING ON THE SPOT WHERE I KNEW IT MUST BE A DROP OF DISTILLED VINEGAR BY DROPPING THE VINEGAR ON THE BOTTOM OF THE LITTLE CUPS I HAD MADE BY CUTTING OFF THE TOPS OF THE CELLS THE FOETUS INSTANTLY BECAME VISIBLE EXPERIMENT VI OPENED ANOTHER NINTH DAY FOETUS CONTAINED WITHIN ITS AM NION FLOATS IN ANOTHER FLUID BETWEEN CHORION AND AMNION WHICH ARE NOW AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE THIS FLUID JELLIES IN PROOF SPI RIT SOME CORPORA LUTEA HAVE CAVITIES OTHERS NONE NOR THE LEAST APPEARANCE OF ORIFICE THE CORPORA LUTEA KEEP INCREASING AS THE FOETUS INCREASES ARE OF A SANDRED COLOUR AND VERY VASCULAR EXPERIMENT VII OPENED A DOE THE ELEVENTH DAY AFTER COITUS OVA VERY LITTLE LARGER THAN THE LAST NOR THE FOETUS THERE WERE BUT TWO OVA THOUGH SEVERAL CORPORA LUTEA SOME PELLUCID HYDATIDS APPEARED HANGING ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE FALLOPIAN TUBES COULD THESE BE OVA WHICH HAD MISSED THE PASSAGE  THEY WERE VASCULAR THE HEART OF THE FOETUS WAS FULL OF BLOOD THE UMBILICAL VESSELS VERY DISTINCT BUT NO CHORD AS YET CONTRARY TO DE GRAAF EXPERIMENT VIII OPENED A DOE THE FOURTEENTH DAY SEVEN CORPORA LUTEA IN ONE OVARIUM AND ONE IN THE OTHER ONLY TWO OVA IN THE HORNS OF THE UTERUS ONE IN EACH THAT IN THE HORN NEXT ONE OF THE OVARIA WITH ONE CORPUS LUTUM WAS BLIGHTED AND THE FOETUS INVISIBLE EVEN WITH DISTILLED VINEGAR IN THE OTHER IT WAS INCREASED PROMTO DISCOVER THE OVA OF RABBITS 203 PORTIONABLE TO THE TIME THE UMBILICAL CHORD NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME DISTINCT AND THE TAIL DETACHED FROM THE UNDER SURFACE OF THE UTERUS THEREWAS SOMETHING UNINTELLIGIBLE ABOUT THE HEAD IT WAS BIFID ON THE SIDE NEXT THE MOUTH WITH A HOLE IN EACH EX TREMITY THE INTESTINES WERE NOW APPARENT AT LEAST THE RECTUM AS WERE THE LOWER EXTREMITIES EXPERIMENT IX OPENED A DOE SIXTH DAY COMPLETE FOUND THE OVA LOOSE IN THE UTERUS AS DESCRIBED BY DE GRAAF AND CORRESPONDING NEARLY TO THE CORPORA LUTEA SIX IN ONE HORN AND FOUR IN THE OTHER THE OVA WERE TRANSPARENT AND OF DIFFERENT SIZES THEY WERE DOUBLE AND CONTAINED EACH AN INTERNAL VESICLE THERE WAS A SPOT ON ONE SIDE IN MOST OF THEM WHICH I CONCEIVED TO BE THE INTENDED POINT OF ADHERENCE BETWEEN THEM AND THE UTERUS THE INTERNAL VESICLE WAS NOT EQUALLY IN PROPORTION TO THE EXTERNAL BUT IN SOME LARGER IN OTHERS LESS I  EVEN SUSPECT I SAW SOMETHING OF THE FOETUS A POLYPOUS EXCRESCENCE IN THE UTERUS NEAR THE ORI FICE OF THE FALLOPIAN TUBE HAD DETAINED FOUR OF THE OVA AT THAT PLACE OTHERS WERE SCATTERED IN THE UTERUS JUST WHERE ONE OF THESE VESICLES HAD BECOME STATIONARY A WHITE VASCULAR BELT WAS BEGINNING TO FORM AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS A CAVITY WHERE THE VESICLE LAY THE INNER MEMBRANE I TAKE TO BE AMNION THE OUTER CHORION EXPERIMENT X OPENED A DOE THE SEVENTH DAY THE OVARIA WERE SHRUNK THERE WERE SOMETHING LIKE THREE CORPORA LUTEA BUT NOT DISTINCT THERE WERE TWO POLYPI OR SOLID EXCRESCENCES IN THE LEFT HORN OF THE UTERUS BUT NO OVA DD 2MR CRUISHANKS EXPERMENTS EXPERIMENT XI THE DAY AFTER A DOE HAD RECEIVED THE MALE I MADE A SMALL OPENING ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ABDOMEN GOT DOWN UPON THE UTERUS JUST WHERE THE FALLOPIAN TUBE GOES OFF TIED THE LEFT TUBE CLOSE TO THE UTERUS WITH A VIEW TO INTERCEPT THE OVA THE RESULT OF THIS MENTIONED AFTERWARDS EXPERIMENT XII OPENED A DOE THE SEVENTH DAY AFTER COITUS OVA ALL FIXED AND ADHERING TO THE UTERUS EVEN MAKING A SENSIBLE SWELL IN FORM OF BELTS AT DIFFERENT PARTS THE AMNION APPEARED IN SOME NEARER THE CHORION THAN IN OTHERS THE LIQUOR BETWEEH AMNION AND HORION VERY GELATINOUS IN MANY OTHERS LESS SO SAW NOTHING OF FOETUS EXPERIMENT XIII OPENED A DOE EIGHTH DAY AFTER COITUS THERE WERE ABOUT TEN OR ELEVEN OVA FOETUS DISTINCT IN ALMOST EVERY ONE BUT NOT WITHOUT THE APPLICATION OF DISTILLED VINEGAR FOR TWO OR THREE MINUTES AND AFTERWARDS IMMERSED IN PROOF SPIRIT IN SOME I FOUND THE BRAIN SPINAL MARROW AND VERTEBRAE FORMING TWO COLUMNS AT SOME DISTANCE THEY AFTERWARDS GRADUALLY AP PROACHED FOR IT WAS IN ONE OF THE LEAST FORWARD THAT THIS WAS MOST EVIDENT EXPERIMENT XIV OPENED A DOE TWENTYFIRST DAY AFTER THE COITUS FIVE VESSELS WERE SEEN GOING OUT OF THE NAVEL IN ONE OF THE FOETUSES BESIDES THE URACHUS THE OMPHALOMESENTERIC ARTERY WAS VERY DISTINCTTO DISCOVER THE OVA OF RABBITS 205 AND DIVIDED INTO TWO AS IT CAME TO THE MESENTERY COULD NOT SEE THE URACHUS OR ALLANTOIS WELL NOR THE MEMBRANE TO WHICH THE OMPHALOMESENTERIC ARTERY GOES EXPERIMENT XV OPENED A DOE THE FIFTH DAY AFTER COITUS FOUND THE OVA LOOSE IN THE UTERUS TO THE NUMBER OF SIX EVEN THESE HAD A LESSER COAT IN THE INSIDE CORRESPONDING TO AMNION NONE IN THE TUBES EXPERIMENT XVI OPENED FOURTEEN DAYS AFTER THE OPERATION THE DOE WHOSE FALLOPIAN TUBE I TIED THE UTERUS OF THE RIGHT SIDE WAS THE SIZE OF THE SIXTH DAY THE OVARIUM AND UTERUS HAD GONE BACK WARDS AS TO THE PROCESS AND THERE WAS NO APPEARANCE OF FOETUS THOUGH PLACENTA WAS VERY EVIDENT ON THE LEFT SIDE THERE WAS NO APPEARANCE OF CONCEPTION IN THE UTERUS NO PLACENTA THE FALLOPIAN TUBE WAS VERY LARGE SOFT AND TENDER THE OVA RIUM TWICE THE SIZE OF THAT ON THE OTHER SIDE RED AND COVERED WITH EXTRAVASATED COAGULABLE LYMPH THERE WAS AN HYDATID IN THE COURSE OF THE TUBE CONTAINING A CLEAR FLUID BUT NOTHING LIKE FOETUS I SUSPECT THAT TYING THE TUBE PREVENTED THE OVA ON THIS SIDE FROM COMING OUT OF THE OVARIUM AND THAT THOUGH THEY RATHER INCREASED IN THE OVARIUM THE PROCESS SOON STOPPED THAT THE PROCESS WENT ON HOWEVER IN THE OTHER SIDE FOR A FEW DAYS AND THEN STOPPED LIKEWISE THERE WAS UNIVERSAL INFLAMMA TION ABOUT THE UTERUS AND COLON OF THE LEFT SIDE WITH GREAT QUAN TITIES OF WHITE EXTRAVASATED COAGULABLE LYMPH THERE WAS WATER IN THE ABDOMEN AND ALL THE APPEARANCE OF PERITONEAL INFLAMMA TION THIS PROCESS SEEMS TO GIVE BUT LITTLE PAIN FOR THE ANIMAL AT THE TIME SHE WAS KILLED WAS EATING AND LOOKING AS USUAL206 MR CRUIKSHANKS EXPERIMENTS EXPERIMENT XVII OPENED A DOE THE THIRD DAY AFTER THE COITUS THE POUTING PARTS OF THE CORPORA LUTEA VERY TRANSPARENT BEFORE THE UTERUS WAS TOUCHED BUT AS SOON AS THE SPERMATIC AND HYPOGASTRIC ARTERIES WERE DIVIDED IN ORDER TO CUT OUT THE UTERUS THEY ALL AS IF STRUCK WITH SOME SHOCK LIKE ELECTRICITY BECAME OPAQUE THE POUTING PART I BELIEVE IS THE OVUM AND STANDS UPON THE TOP OF CORPUS LUTEUM IT IS VERY VASCULAR PARTICULARLY AT ITS BASIS BUT AS SOON AS PERFECT OR READY FOR EXPULSION CARRIES NO RED BLOOD IT CONTINUES TO GROW OF ITSELF IN UTERO WITHOUT ADHERING TO THE UTERUS FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS THEN TAKES ROOT AND BECOMES VERY VASCULAR NOTHING IN THE TUBES OR UTERUS EXPERIMENT XVIII OPENED ANOTHER THE FOURTH DAY IN THE MORNING BUT IT HAD NOT CONCEIVED AND WAS IN THE STATE OF ONE HOT EXPERIMENT XIX OPENED ONE IN THE EVENING OF THE FOURTH DAY THE APPEAR ANCES WERE LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE FIFTH MORNING THE OVA WERE ONLY LESS DISPERSED THROUGH THE UTERUS AND ALL ACCU MULATED ABOUT THE ORIFICE OF THE TUBES THE AMNION WAS LIKE WISE CLOSER TO THE CHORION EXPERIMENT XX OPENED ANOTHER AT THE END OF THE THIRD DAY OR RATHER ON THE BEGINNING OF THE FOURTH THE OVARIA WERE DARK BROWN THE FALLOPIAN TUBES AND UTERUS ALMOST BLACK FROM THE GREAT QUAN TITY OF BLOOD DERIVED TO THEM AT THIS TIME I OPENED THIS UTERUSTO DISCOVER THE OVA OF RABBITS 207 ON THE UPPER EDGE AND IN THE BODY SO THAT THE PARTS ALL RE MAINED TURGID THE SPERMATICS AND HYPOGASTRICS NOT CUT THROUGH THE CORPORA LUTEA WERE VERY VASCULAR AN ARTERY RUN INING ACROSS RAMIFIED FROM BOTH SIDES BUT PARTICULARLY SPENT ITSELF IN THE CENTRE THE UPPER PART OF THE CORPUS LUTEUM OR CENTRE WAS A LITTLE CONCAVE LIKE THE HEAD OF A TURNED SMALL POCK BUT NO EVIDENT FORAMEN I BELIEVE THE OVA WERE GONE OUT BUT I COULD SEE NOTHING OF THEM IN THE TUBES NOR UTERUS THE FIMBRKE WERE MORE VASCULAR THAN I EVER SAW THEM AND WHOLLY COVERED THE OVARIA THE PERISTALTIC MOTION OF THE TUBES WAS VERY EVIDENT AND GREATER THAN EVER I HAD SEEN IT THE INNER SURFACE OF THE HORNS WAS GRANIFORM WITH WHITE SPOTS THIS I SUPPOSE DECIDUA OR PERHAPS CORPUS GLANDULOSUM EVERRAHDI DE GRAAF SAW THE OVA IN THE TUBES THIS DAY EXPERIMENT XXI OPENED A RABBIT AT SIX DAYS AND A HALF OVA IN THE HORNS OF THE UTERUS WERE JUST BEGUN TO FIX BUT DID NOT ADHERE BY VES SELS THEY WERE VERY MUCH ENLARGED COMPARED WITH THE SIXTH AND THE SIDE NEXT THE UTERUS HAD A ROUND ROUGH SPOT IN IT NOW VERY CONSPICUOUS THE CHORION AND AMNION WERE ALMOST IN CONTACT WITH ONE ANOTHER THEY WERE EASILY TURNED OUT OF THE UTERUS WHICH EMBRACED THEM EVERY WHERE LOOSELY BUT AT THE BOTTOM THE CORPORA LUTEA NOW INCREASED EXCEEDINGLY IN VAS CULARITY AND NOURISHED BY A LARGE VESSL RUNN NG ACROSS THE TUBES REMARKABLY PALE AS HAVING DONE THEIR DUTY THE GRA NIFORMN APPEARANCE ON THE UTERUS INTERNALLY NOT OBSERVABLE AS IN THE LASTEXPERIMENT XXII OPENED A DOE THE SEVENTH DAY COMPLETE AFTER THE COITUS TURNED OUT BUT WITH DIFFICULTY ONE OF THE OVA A LITTLE LARGER THAN IN THE LAST THE SUBSTANCE OF THE UTERUS OVER THESE WAS BECOME THIN AND TRANSPARENT SO AT FIRST SIGHT YOU WOULD IMA GINE IT WAS THE OVUM NAKED NEITHER WAS THIS PART SO VASCULAR AS ONE MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED CONSIDERING THE PRINCIPAL CHANGE WAS GOING ON HERE THE OVUM BURST THE MOMENT IT WAS DISEN GAGED FROM THE UTERUS A GELATINOUS COAGULABLE FLUID ISSUED OUT BUT NO APPEARANCE OF FOETUS EVEN IN THE MICROSCOPE EXPERIMENT XXIII OPENED ANOTHER RABBIT AT THE END OF THE THIRD DAY SAME APPEARANCE AS IN EXP XX SEARCHED IN VAIN FOR THE OVA ON THE RIGHT SIDE AT LAST BY DRAWING A PROBE GENTLY OVER THE FAL LOPIAN TUBE ON THE LEFT SIDE BEFORE IT WAS OPENED MORE THAN AN INCH ON THE SIDE NEXT THE UTERUS I PRESSED OUT SEVERAL OVA WHICH SEEMED TO COME FROM ABOUT ITS MIDDLE AS I BEGAN THE PRESSURE THERE AND THE OVA DID NOT APPEAR TILL THE VERY LAST THE AMNION MADE A CENTRE SPOT AND APPEARED SMALL COMPARED TO THE CHORION NO OVA IN THE UTERUS EXPERIMENT XXIV OPENED ANOTHER AT THREE DAYS AND A HALF OVARIA HAD THE APPEARANCE AS IF THE OVA HAD NOT YET GONE OUT HOWEVER MANY OF THEM WERE FOUND IN THE UTERUS AND MANY IN THE TUBES I GOT ABOUT SIX OTHERS WERE LOST FROM THE GREAT DIFFICULTY IN SLITTING UP THE FALLOPIAN TUBES WITHOUT BRUISING THE OVA WITH THE FINGERS OR WITH THE POINT OF SCISSARS THERETO DISCOVER THE OVA OF RABBITS 209 WERE EIGHT OR NINE CORPPRA LUTEA IN ONE OVARIUM AND TWO ONLY IN THE OTHER ON THE SIDE OF THE TWO I ONLY FOUND ONE OVUM BUT TWICE AS LARGE AS THOSE ON THE OTHER SIDE I OBSERVED THAT THE REDNESS OF THE UTERUS DEPENDED ON NOT LOSING MUCH OF THE ANIMALS BLOOD FOR WHEN THEY HAD BEEN SO KILLED THAT MUCH BLOOD WAS LOST THE FALLOPIAN TUBES AT LEAST AND OVARIA WERE ALWAYS PALE EXPERIMENT XXV OPENED ANOTHER RABBIT AT TWO DAYS AND A HALF AFTER THE COITUS OVARIA IMPREGNATED BUT FOUND NO OVA IN THE TUBES NOR ORIFICES IN THE CORPORA LUTEA EXPERIMENT XXVI OPENED ONE THIRD DAY COMPLETE FOUND ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN OVA IN THE FALLOPIAN TUBES NEAR THEIR END OR ABOUT AN INCH WITHIN THE TUBE ON THE SIDE NEXT THE UTERUS IN THE MICRO SCOPE THE OVUM APPEARED AS HAVING THREE COATS THE MIDDLE ONE PERHAPS BECOMES ALLANTOIS OR MEMBRANA QUARTA EXPERIMENT XXVII OPENED AGAIN ANOTHER AT TWO DAYS AND HALF AND THOUGH THERE WERE A GREAT MANY COIPORA LUTEA I COULD NOT DISCOVER ANY OVA THEY WERE PROBABLY TOO SMALL TO BE PERCEIVED FOR ON THE THIRD DAY COMPLETE SOME OF THE OVA WERE NOT PERCEPTIBLE TILL THEY WERE PUT INTO A FLUID AND VIEWED IN THE MICROSCOPE EXPERIMENT XXVIII OPENED ONE THE THIRD DAY ALL BUT TWO HOURS FOUND SIX OVA IN ONE FALLOPIAN TUBE AND SEVEN IN THE OTHER WHICH CORRES MDCCXCVII E EMR CRUIXKSHANKS EXPERIMENTS PONDED EXACTLY TO THE NUMBER OF CORPORA LUTEA IN EACH OVARIUM THE OVA HAD THREE MEMBRANES AS BEFORE THE CIRCLES IN THE CI CATRICULA OF THE HENS EGG ARE PERHAPS SIMILAR TO THESE THE OVA SEEM TO ENLARGE IN THEIR WAY DOWN THE TUBE AS A PEA SWELLS IN THE GROUND BEFORE IT BEGINS TO TAKE ROOT EVEN IN THE UTERUS FOR TWO DAYS THEY ARE EITHER LOOSE AND UNCONNECTED BY VESSELS OR THE VESSELS ARE SO SMALL AS NOT TO BE DISCOVERED BY THE MICROSCOPE THE CORPORA LUTEA WERE FLATTER ON THE HEAD THAN I HAD EVER SEEN THEM BEFORE EXPERIMENT XXIX I OPENED ANOTHER AT EIGHT DAYS AND A HALF EVERY THING MORE DISTINCT AND MORE ADVANCED THAN ON THE EIGHTH DAY THE HEART NOW VISIBLE AND RESEMBLING MUCH THE APPEARANCE OF THE INCU BATED EGG IN THE FORTYEIGHTH HOUR THERE WERE SEVEN CORPORA LUTEA IN THE RIGHT OVARIUM AND BUT FOUR OVA IN THE RIGHT HORN OF THE UTERUS THERE WERE ALSO THREE IN THE LEFT OVARIUM THOUGH BUT TWO OVA IN THE LEFT HORN GENERAL CONCLUSIONS IST THE OVUM IS FORMED IN AND COMES OUT OF THE OVARIUM AFTER CONCEPTION 2DLY IT PASSES DOWN THE FALLOPIAN TUBE AND IS SOME DAYS IN COMING THROUGH IT 3DLY IT IS SOMETIMES DETAINED IN THE FALLOPIAN TUBE AND PRE VENTED FROM GETTING INTO THE UTERUS 4THLY DE GRAAF SAW ONE OVUM ONLY IN THE FALLOPIAN TUBE IN OVIDUCTUS DEXTRI MEDIO UNUM  I SAW THIRTEEN IN ONE IN STANCE FIVE IN ANOTHER SEVEN IN ANOTHER AND THREE IN ANOTHER IN ALL TWENTYEIGHT TO DISCOVER THE OVA OF RABBITS 211 5THLY THE OVUM COMES INTO THE UTERUS ON THE FOURTH DAY 6THLY DE GRAAF DID NOT SEE THE FOETUS TILL THE TENTH DAY I SAW IT ON THE EIGHTH 7THLY THESE EXPERIMENTS EXPLAIN WHAT IS SEEN IN THE HUMAN FEMALE FOR A I SHEW A CHILD AT LECTURES WHICH REMAINED IN THE OVARIA TILL IT WAS THE SIZE OF THE FIFTH MONTH ITS FLUIDS WERE ALL WASTED AND ITS SOLIDS WERE HARD AND COMPRESSED INTO AN OVAL FORM IT HAD THE CHORION AND AMNION ITS CHORD AND PLACENTA B I ALSO HAVE IN MY POSSESSION THE UTERUS AND OVARIA OF A YOUNG WOMAN WHO DIED WITH THE MENSES UPON HER THE EXTER NAL MEMBRANES OF THE OVARIA ARE BURST AT ONE PLACE FROM WHENCE I SUSPECT AN OVUM ESCAPED DESCENDED THROUGH THE TUBE TO THE UTERUS AND WAS WASHED OFF BY THE MENSTRUAL BLOOD G THE OVUM SOMETIMES MISSES THE FALLOPIAN TUBE FALLS INTO THE ABDOMEN AND FORMS THE EXTRAUTERINE FOETUS THIS SOME TIMES GROWS TO ITS FULL SIZE LABOUR PAINS COME ON AT THE NINTH MONTH THE CHILD MAY THEN BE TAKEN OUT ALIVE BY THE CAESAREAN SECTION OR DYING AND WASTING BUT NOT PUTREFYING MAY REMAIN WITHOUT MUCH INCONVENIENCY TO THE MOTHER FOR MANY YEARS D THE OVUM ALTHOUGH IT HAS GONE SOME WAY DOWN THE FALLOPIAN TUBE MAY BE ARRESTED IN ITS COURSE AND BECOME STA TIONARY AND FORM WHAT IS CALLED THE FALLOPIAN TUBE CASE A REMARKABLE CASE OF THIS KIND ISGIVEN BY DR HUNTER IN HIS BOOK ON THE GRAVID UTERUS WHERE THE TUBE BURST AND THE MO THER BLED TO DEATH E LASTLY THE OVUM COMES INTO THE UTERUS WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR ITS ENLARGEMENT AND A PASSAGE FOR ITS EXIT FROM THE BODY EE 2212 MR CRUIKSUANKS EXPERIMENTS P S THESE EXPERIMENTS HAVE BEEN READ AND THE PREPARD TIONS AND ENGRAVINGS SHEWN IN THE LECTURES ON THE GRAVID UTERUS GIVEN AT WINDMILLSTREET EVERY YEAR SINCE THE ORIGINAL DATE OF THIS JOURNAL EXPLANATION OF THE PLATE TAB IV IT WAS NOT THOUGHT NECESSARY TO DELINEATE THE WHOLE UTERUS OF THE RABBIT AS IT EXACTLY RESEMBLES THE UTERUS OF OTHER QUADRU PEDS CONSISTING OF A VAGINA COMMON TO TWO HORNS TWO FALLO PIAN TUBES AND TWO OVARIES ANY ONE WHO WISHES TO SEE THIS MAY SEE IT IN DE GRAAFS LITTLE BOOK TOLERABLY WELL EXECUTED FOR THE AGE IN WHICH HE LIVED BUT I AM MORE CONCERNED IN HIS FIRST APPEARANCES OF THE OVA THAN IN HIS GENERAL ANATOMY OF THE UTERUS OF THE RABBIT AND THEREFORE PROCEED TO EXPLAIN THE COPY OF A PLATE PREVIOUSLY ENGRAVED NINETEEN YEARS AGO THE FIGURES MARKED 3D DAY ARE OVA OF THE FALLOPIAN TUBE FOUND AFTER IMPREGNATION ON THAT DAY THE THREE FIRST ARE OF THE NATURAL SIZE THE THREE NEXT ARE MAGNIFIED IN THE SIMPLE MICROSCOPE IN ALL OF THEM THE CHORION AND AMNION ARE EVEN NOW DISTINCT AND IN SOME OF THEM THE ALLANTOIS AS I SUSPECT THE FIGURES MARKED SI DAY ARE OVA STILL MORE ADVANCED SIMILAR TO WHICH I FOUND MANY IN THE TUBES MANY IN THE HORNS OF THE UTERUS THE THREE FIRST ARE OF THE NATURAL SIZE THE TWO FOLLOWING ARE MAGNIFIED ALSO IN THE SIMPLE MICRO SLCOPE THE FIGURES MARKED 4TH DAY ARE MORE ENLARGED OVA IN THE HORNS OF THE UTERUS LOOSE NOT ADHERING CAPABLE OF BEINGTO DISCOVER THE OVA OF RABBITS 213 MOVED FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER AFTER THESE HORNS ARE OPEN ED BY THE GENTLEST BREATH BLOWN THROUGH A BLOWPIPE THE FIGURES MARKED 5TH DAY ARE OVA OF THE FIFTH DAY STILL LOOSE IN UTERO AND STILL CAPABLE OF BEING BLOWN WITH THE GENTLEST BREATH FROM ONE PART TO ANOTHER THEY RESEMBLE THE LAST IN EVERY THING ONLY THAT THEY ARE LARGER THE THREE FIRST ARE OF THE NATURAL SIZE THE THREE LAST MAGNIFIED AS THE FOR MER OVA THE FIGURES MARKED 6TH DAY ARE OVA FOUND IN THE HORNS OF THE UTERUS ON THAT DAY SENSIBLY LARGER THAN THE PRECEDING NOT ADHERING EVEN NOW TO THE INTERNAL SURFAE OF THE UTERUS BUT EXACTLY AS THE LAST IN THIS RESPECT THE FOUR FIRST ARE OF THE NATURAL SIZE THE THREE LAST MAGNIFIED AS BEFORE BUT AS KEPT SOME YEARS THE AMNION HAS RECEDED FROM THE CHORION TO A CON SIDERABLE DEGREE THE FIGURES MARKED 7TH DAY ARE OVA OF THE SEVENTH DAY THE FIRST SHEWS THE OVUM IN ITS CELL IN THE HORN OF THE UTERUS LAID OPERR THE THREE NEXT ARE SIMILAR OVA TAKEN OUT OF THEIR CELLS AND RESEMBLING THE FORMER THE THREE LAST ARE OF THE SAME PE RIOD AND ALSO REMOVED FROM THE UTERUS BUT MAGNIFIED BY THE SAME MICROSCOPE AS THE PRECEDING OVA THEY ARE SEEN AFTER HAVING BEEN KEPT MANY YEARS AND THE SECESSION OF THE AMNION FROM THE CHORION IS STILL MORE APPARENT AND GREATER THE FIGURES MARKED 8TH DAY THE FIRST SHOWS THE FOETUS NOW FIRST VISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE BY DROPPING DISTILLED VINEGAR ON IT IN ONE OF THE CELLS OF THE UTERUS OPENED A LITTLE ABOVE IS SEEN A CELL TURGID AND UNOPENED AND BELOW A CELL HALF DIVIDED THE TWO NEXT FIGURES IN THE SAME LINE WITH THE FOETUS MEN TIONED ARE FOETUSES OF THE SAME PERIOD FROM OTHER RABBITS214 MR CRUIKSHANKS EXPERIMENTS C MAGNIFIED THEY SHOW THE RUDIMENTS OF THE VERTEBRA AND THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF THE SPINAL MARROW THE THIRD IN THE SAME ROW IS ALSO MAGNIFIED IT SHOWS ALSO THE EARLIER APPEARANCES OF THE TWO HEMISPHERES OF THE BRAIN OF THE FIGURES MARKED 9TH DAY ONE SHOWS THE FOETUS NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME OF ITSELF VISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE ADHERING NEAR THE TAIL TO THE PLACENTA IN THE CLOSEST MANNER THE NAVEL STRING AS YET TOO SHORT TO BE VISIBLE AS CONTRARYTO DE GRAAF AS POSSIBLE THE SECOND SHOWS THE SAME FOETUS MAGNIFIED THE FIGURE ON THE OUTSIDE OF WHICH IS NO LO SHOWS AFAL LOPIAN TUBE ON ONE SIDE OF THE UTERUS OF THE RABBIT WITH ITS FIMBRIATED ORIFICE

PRINTED BY TAYLOR AND FRANCIS RED LION COURT FLEET STREET MDCCCLIXeA D V E R T ITS EM E N T THE Committee appointed by the Royal Society to direct the publication of the Philosophical Transactions take this opportunity to acquaint the Public that it fully appears as well from the Councilbooks and Journals of the Society as from repeated declarations which have been made in several former Transactions that the printing of them was always from time to time the single act of the respective Secretaries till the Fortyseventh Volume the Society as a Body never interesting themselves any further in their publication than by occasionally recommending the revival of them to some of their Secretaries when from the particular circumstances of their affairs the Transactions had happened for any length of time to be intermitted And this seems principally to have been done with a view to satisfy the Public that their usual meetings were then continued for the improvement of knowledge and benefit of mankind the great ends of their first institution by the Royal Charters and which they have ever since steadily pursued But the Society being of late years greatly enlarged and their communications more numerous it was thought advisable that a Committee of their members should be appointed to reconsider the papers read before them and select out of them such as they should judge most proper for publication in the future Transactions which was accordinglydone upon the 26th of March 1752 And the grounds of their choice are and will continue to be the importance and singularity of the subjects or the advantageous manner of treating them without pretending to answer for the certainty of the facts or propriety of the reasonings contained in the several papers so published which must still rest on the credit or judgement of their respective authors It is likewise necessary on this occasion to remark that it is an established rule of the Society to which they will always adhere never to give their opinion as a Body upon any subject either of Nature or Art that comes before them And therefore the a 2I iv  thanks which are frequently proposed from the Chair to be given to the authors of such papers as are read at their accustomed meetings or to the persons through whose hands they received them are to be considered in no other light than as a matter of civility in return for the respect shown to the Society by those communications The like also is to be said with regard to the several projects inventions and curiosities of various kinds which are often exhibited to the Society the authors whereof or those who exhibit them frequently take the liberty to report and even to certify in the public newspapers that they have met with the highest applause and approbation And therefore it is hoped that no regard will hereafter be paid to such reports and public notices which in some instances have been too lightly credited to the dishonour of the Society The Meteorological Journal hitherto kept by the Assistant Secretary at the Apart ments of the Royal Society by order of the President and Council and published in the Philosophical Transactions has been discontinued The Government on the recom mendation of the President and Council has established at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich under the superintendence of the Astronomer Royal a Magnetical and Meteorological Observatory where observations are made on an extended scale which are regularly published These which correspond with the grand scheme of observations now carrying out in different parts of the globe supersede the necessity of a continuance of the observations made at the Apartments of the Royal Society which could not be rendered so perfect as was desirable on account of the imperfections of the locality and the multiplied duties of the observerA List of Public Institutions and Individuals entitled to receive a copy of the Philoso phical

J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107686,SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE BUFFY COAT OF THE BLOOD C,I206977, 271 1 XXI SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE BUFFY COAT OF THE BLOOD C BY JOHN DAVY M D F R S READ APRIL 18 1822 1 THE BUFFY COAT AS IT IS TECHNICALLY CALLED WHICH APPEARS ON BLOOD DRAWN FROM PERSONS LABOURING UNDER INFLAMMATORY DISEASE HAS BEEN REFERRED BY MR HEWSON TO TWO CIRCUM STANCES TO INCREASED TENUITY OF THE BLOOD AND TO ITS SLOW COAGULATION BUT IN THE EXPLANATION WHICH IS NOW USUALLY GIVEN OF THE PHENOMENON IT IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE LATTER CIRCUM STANCE TO THE ENTIRE NEGLECT OF THE FORMER THE REVERSE OF THIS I BELIEVE WOULD BE MORE CORRECT FOR IN CASES IN WHICH THE INFLAMMATORY DIATHESIS IS BEST MARKED THE SEPARATION OF THE RED PARTICLES FROM THE BLOOD DRAWN IS MOST RAPID OFTEN OCCURRING IN ONE OR TWO MINUTES AND IN SOME DISEASES PAR TICULARLY IN ERYSIPELAS THE BLOOD TAKEN FROM A VEIN COAGULATES AS RAPIDLY AS HEALTHY BLOOD AND YET EXHIBITS THE BUFFY COAT IN INSTANCES OF THIS KIND WHEN I HAVE WATCHED THE COAGULA TION OF THE BLOOD THE RED PARTICLES HAVE SUBSIDED IN THE SHORT SPACE OF TWO MINUTES LEAVING A SUPERNATANT STRATUM OF COAGU LABLE LYMPH TRANSPARENT AND LIQUID THE BUFFY COAT IN THESE INSTANCES DID NOT APPEAR ON THE BLOOD COLLECTED IN THE COM MON BLEEDING CUPS ONLY WHEN SMALL VESSELS AS WINEGLASSES OR SMALL GALLIPOTS WERE USED AND QUICKLY FILLED AND INSTANTLY SET ASIDE TO REST MAY IT NOT THEREFORE BE INFERRED GENERALLY  AN EXPERIMENTAL INQUIRY INTO THE PROPERTIES OF THE BLOOD WITH REMARKS ON SOME OF ITS MORBID APPEARANCES BY WILLIAM HEWSON F R S LONDON 1771 P 56 AND 59572 DR DAVYS OBSERVATIONS ON THE THAT THE BUFFY COAT IS PRINCIPALLY OWING NOT TO THE SLOW COAGU LATION OF THE BLOOD ON WHICH IT APPEARS BUT TO ITS INCREASED TENUITY OR IN OTHER WORDS TO THE DIMINISHED VISCIDITY OF COAGULABLE LYMPH THE EFFECT OF MORBID VASCULAR ACTION CON NECTED WITH THE INFLAMMATORY DIATHESIS MR HEY HAS ASSERTED IN OPPOSITION TO MR HEWSON THAT THE COAGULABLE LYMPH IS NOT ITSELF ATTENUATED IN INFLAMMATORY DISEASES AND THAT WHEN IT APPEARS TO BE SO IT IS FROM DILUTION WITH SERUM WERE THIS OPINION CORRECT SUCH BLOOD SHOULD BE OF LOW SPECIFIC GRAVITY WHICH IT IS NOT AS I HAVE SATISFIED MYSELF BY NUMEROUS EXPERIMENTS MADE BOTH IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN CEYLON IN GENERAL I HAVE FOUND THE BLOOD ON WHICH A BUFFY COAT HAS APPEARED OF HIGHER SPECIFIC GRAVITY THAN HEALTHY BLOOD 2 IT IS AN OPINION PRETTY GENERALLY PREVALENT THAT THE AGE OF THESE MORBID ADHESIONS WHICH ARE SO FREQUENTLY MET WITH IN THE DISSECTION OF BODIES CONNECTING TOGETHER SEROUS MEM BRANES MAY BE GUESSED AT BY THEIR STRENGTH THUS WEAK ADHESIONS ARE USUALLY CONSIDERED OF RECENT ORIGIN AND FIRM ADHESIONS OF LONG STANDING IS THIS OPINION CORRECT AND DOES IT AGREE WITH THE PROPERTIES OF COAGULABLE LYMPH OF WHICH THESE ADHESIONS ARE PRINCIPALLY FORMED  MANY CIRCUM STANCES OF WHICH IT WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MENTION A FEW LEAD TO A REPLY IN THE NEGATIVE WOUNDS IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT HEAL BY THE FIRST INTENTION ARE OFTEN FIRMLY UNITED IN TWENTYFOUR HOURS I HAVE OBSERVED STRONG ADHESIONS FORMED IN THE SAME SPACE OF TIME BETWEEN THE SURFACES OF THE PLEURA IN CONSEQUENCE OF INFLAMMATION ARTIFICIALLY EXCITED AN INSTANCE MAY BE GIVEN OEBSERVATIONS ON THE BLOOD BY WILLIAM HEY F R S LONDON 1779 P 4749BUFFY COAT OF THE BLOOD AT COLOMBO IN THE ISLAND OF CEYLON IN JANUARY I819I MADE THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENT ON A YOUNG DOG NEARLY FULL GROWN AN OPENING WAS MADE WITH A SCALPEL BETWEEN THE RIBS OF THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE CHEST THROUGH WHICH ABOUT A SCRUPLE OF ARRACK WAS INJECTED INTO THE CAVITY OF THE PLEURA THE LUNG WAS SLIGHTLY WOUNDED AIR PASSED FREELY THROUGH THE OPENING AND A LITTLE FROTHY BLOOD WAS DISCHARGED THE ANIMAL AT FIRST SEEMED TO SUFFER MUCH PAIN AND TO BE VERY LANGUID BUT LEFT TO ITSELF IT GRADUALLY RECOVERED AND IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY TOOK SOME FOOD AT THE EXPIRATION OF TWENTYFOUR HOURS IT WAS HOT BUT APPARENTLY NOT SUFFERING PAIN IT WAS RUNNING ABOUT AND THE WOUND WAS CLOSED IT WAS NOW KILLED AND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY EXAMINED A GOOD DEAL OF VASCULAR COAGULATED LYMPH WAS FOUND UNDER THE SKIN ROUND THE WOUND CONNECTING THE CUTIS AND THE INTERCOSTAL MUSCLES THE ADJOIN ING CELLULAR MEMBRANE WAS INFLAMED SOME BLOODY SERUM WAS EFFUSED INTO THE RIGHT CAVITY OF THE CHEST MANY PRETTY FIRM AND LONG ADHESIOM HAD FORMED BETWEEN THE PLEURA PUL MONALIS AND COSTALIS BOTH WHICH WERE OF A REDDISH HUE  THERE WERE MANY ADHESIONS TOO BETWEEN THE PLEURA AND PERICARDIUM AND THE PERICARDIUNL WAS INFLAMED AND GENERALLY ADHERENT TO THE SURFACE OF THE HEART THE COAGULATED LYMPH OF THE BUFFY COAT OF THE BLOOD MAY BE USED AS AN ILLUSTRATION AND CONFIRMATION OF THE SHORT TIME IN WHICH STRONG ADHESIONS MAY FORM LIQUID WHEN THE BLOOD IS DRAWN COAGULABLE LYMPH GRADUALLY BECOMES FIRST VISCID AND AFTERWARDS SOLID IN THE VISCID STATE AS I HAVE FREQUENTLY OBSERVED WHEN IT IS STILL TRANSPARENT IT HAS THE TENACITY OF MUCUS AND A IMITS OF BEING DRAWTN OUT INTO FIBRES AND BANDS WHICH SOON BECOMING SOLID AND OPAQUE VERY WELL REPRESENT MDCCCXXII N N 073DR DAVYS OBSERVATIONS ON THE THE ORDINARY ADHESIONS OF THE LUNGS AND IN A VERY FEW HOURS ATTAIN THEIR MAXIMUM OF STRENGTH THIS VISCIDITY WHICH COAGULABLE LYMPH ACQUIRES IN PASSING FROM A LIQUID TO A SOLID FORM HAS NOT THAT I AM AWARE BEEN NOTICED BY AUTHORS AND THE FORMATION OF ADHESIONS IS USU ALLY EXPLAINED WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THIS QUALITY THOUGH I BELIEVE THE COMMON OPINION TO BE UNTENABLE THAT THE AGE OF ADHESIONS CAN BE DECIDED BY THEIR STRENGTH IT IS FAR FROM MY INTENTION TO MAINTAIN THAT THEY DO NOT BECOME FIRMER IN PROGRESS OF TIME OR THAT THEIR DURATION MAY NOT OCCASIONALLY BE CONJECTURED FROM THEIR APPEARANCE AND RE SISTANCE G IT IS BELIEVED BY MANY THAT THE SMALL PORTIONS OF SEROUS FLUID WHICH ARE FOUND AFTER DEATH IN THE CAVITIES OF SEROUS MEMBRANES ESPECIALLY IN THE PERICARDIUM AND THE VENTRICLES OF THE BRAIN MAY HAVE BEEN POURED OUT AFTER THE CESSATION OF LIFET I AM NOT AWARE THAT THIS OPINION IS OTHER THAN HYPO THETICAL OR THAT IT IS SUPPORTED BY ANY PRECISE FACTS AS A THEORETICAL CONCLUSION ITS CORRECTNESS SEEMS DOUBTFUL I HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO PUT IT TO THE TEST OF EXPERIMENT AND THE RE SULT HAS NOT BEEN FAVOURABLE TO IT I HAVE NOTES OF THREE DIF FERENT EXPERIMENTS ON DOGS WHICH WERE MADE IN CEYLON IN 1818 ALL WHICH SEEM TO SHOW THAT UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUM STANCES NO EFFISION OF SERUM OR EXUDATION SO AS TO OCCASION ACCUMULATION TAKES PLACE AFTER DEATH THE EXPERIMENTS WERE BRIEFLY THE FOLLOWING IN EACH INSTANCE A HEALTHY DOG WAS  VIDE THE

QUANTITY OF SERUM WAS FOUND IN IT WHICH WAS RE MOVED WITH A SPONGE AND THE INCISIONS MADE WERE CLOSED BY SUTURES AT THE END OF TWENTYFOUR HOURS THE SUTURES WERE DIVIDED AND THE PERICARDIUM WAS AGAIN EXAMINED NOT A SINGLE DROP OF FLUID HAD COLLECTED IN IT IN ANY INSTANCE THOUGH IN TWO OF THE TRIALS THE RIGHT AURICLE AND VENTRICLE WERE CONSIDERABLY DISTENDED WITH BLOOD IF THESE RESULTS BE CONCLUSIVE AGAINST FLUID BEING EFFUSED INTO THE PERICARDIUM AFTER DEATH IN DOGS THE CONCLUSION FROM THEM ADMITS OF BEING EXTENDED BY ANALOGY TO OTHER CAVITIES OF THE SAME TEXTURE AND TO MAN AND I AM NOT ACQUAINTED WITH ANY PATHOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS IN OPPOSITION TO IT THE DISCOVERY OF SEROUS EFFUSIONS IN EXAMINATIONS POST MORTEM NO SYMPTOMS OF THEIR OCCURRENCE OR EXISTENCE HAVING BEEN NOTICED DURING LIFE IS SURELY NO EVIDENCE OF THEIR HAVING TAKEN PLACE AFTER THE CESSATION OF VITAL ACTION IT IS TOO WELL KNOWN TO BE INSISTED ON THAT LARGE PORTIONS OF FLUID MAY ACCUMU LATE IN THE PERICARDIUM AND EVEN IN THE VENTRICLES OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT A SINGLE SYMPTOM TO INDICATE THE FACT FORT PITT CHATHAM MARCH 5 182Z

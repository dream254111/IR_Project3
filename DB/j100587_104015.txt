Letter from Dr Robert James of Lichfield to Sir Hans Sloane Bart Pr R S containing some Expe riments made upon Mad Dogs with Mercury Lichfield June 3 1735 S I R IN pursuance of your Commands I here give you an Account of some Experiments that have been made upon Mad Dogs with Mercury which I apprehend I have some Reason to believe is the 3 most245 most effectual Preservative against and perhaps even a Cure for the Hydrophobia About Michaelmas 1731 I waited on Mr Floyer of Hints a Gentleman who is very curious in Fox Hounds He complaind that He was afraid of a Madness amongst his Hounds for that Morning one had run mad in the Kennel and he was appre hensive that most of the rest were bit by him I took this Opportunity of telling him that I had long believd that Mercury would if tryd prove the best Remedy against this Infection and that if the Idea I had formd of this Poison was just I was pretty sure the Medicine would answer notwith standing the Difficulty there is of determining the Effects of a Medicine a priori and that it was at least worth while to try Mr Floyer neglected this Advice till the February following Mean time he tryd the Medicine in Bates commonly known by the Name of the PewterMedicine as also every thing else which was recommended to him by other Sportsmen but to no Purpose for some of his Hounds run mad almost every Day af ter Hunting Upon this he took his Hounds to the Sea and had every one of them dipt in the Salt Water and at his Return brought his Pack to a nother Gentlemans Kennel six Miles distant from his own But notwithstanding this Precaution he lost six or seven Couple of his Dogs in a Fortnights Time About this Time which was in February I waited on him at his new Habitation and found him in that Distress not unusual with Sportsmen up on these Occasions I askd him if he had tryd the Experiment I recommended He said he had I i 2 not246 not but that two of his Hounds were then mad and he would that Night do it He shewed me the Dogs and they were both as far gone as I ever have seen any They refusd Food of all Sorts par ticularly Fluids slaverd much and had all the Symp toms of a Hydrophobia to a great Degree He sent immediately to Lichfield for all the Turpeth Mine ral he could get and that Night gave twelve Grains apiece to the two Dogs which vomited and pur ged them gently Twentyfour Hours after this he gave to each twentyfour Grains and after the same Interval he gave fortyeight more to each The Dogs salivated considerably and soon after lapd warm Milk At the End of twentyfour Hours more he repeated to one Dog twentyfour Grains more and omitted it to the other The Dog that took this last Dose lay upon the Ground salivated extreamly was in great Agonies and had all the Symptoms of a Salivation raisd too quick but got through it and is at this Time alive The other relapsed and died To all the rest of the Pack he gave seven Grains of the Turpeth for the first Dose the second twelve at twentyfour Hours distance which was repeated every other Day for some little Time The Me thod was repeated at the two or three succeeding Fulls and Changes of the Moon From this Time he lost not another Hound and though several have since been bit by strange Dogs the Turpeth has always prevented any ill Consequences I and my Friends have tryd the same Thing since upon a Multitude of Dogs and it has never failed in any one Instance though Dogs bit at the same Time247 Time and by the same Dogs have run mad after most other Methods had been tryd As to the Experiments made upon Mankind I have had Opportunities of making but three The first was about two Years and a half ago up on a Girl about fourteen Years old The Calf of her Leg was so torn by a Mad Dog that the Sur geon was obliged to use Means to prevent a Morti fication from the Bite She was vomited by the Turpeth Three Days before the next Change of the Moon the Vomit was repeated and again the very Day of its changing The same Method was pursued the next Full Moon The Girl is very well The second was a Boy of about ten Years of Age He had Four Holes in one of his Legs made by a Mad Dog in November last The Turpeth was given as above and the Wounds dressed with Digestives and he continues well These two livd near Burton upon Trent and Mr Towndrow of that Place was Apothecary The third Case was that of a young Man near Tamworth of about eighteen The Bite was up on the Hand A great Number of Dogs were bit at the same Time in the Town where he livd About six Days after the Mischief was done several Dogs that had been wounded ran mad upon which he applied himself to Mr Wilson Apothecary in Tamworth to whom I had communicated the Suc cess of the Turpeth in this Case The young Man was at this Time very melancholly and dejected had Tremors and slept very little for some Nights before though he was not apprehensive that the Dog which248 which bit him was mad He had a dry Scab upon his Hand He was upon applying to Mr Wilson vomited with Vin Benedict  The next Thing he took was made according to the following Prescription  Turpeth Min gr xij Lap Contrayerv 3i Ther Androm q s M F Bol No 3 sumat unum singulis

Tre mors went off and slept better After this he went into the ColdBath and continues perfectly well But what is remarkable in this Case is that the Wound ran a thick digested Matter after this Me thod and threw off the Scab like an Escar after which it healed of itself I will not presume to philosophize upon these Cases when I am writing to one who is so much better capable of doing it than I can pretend to be Much less shall I pretend to determine whether Mercury has these Effects from its specifick Pro perties which enables it to prevent or dissolve those inflammatory Concretions which cause the Hydro phobia or from the Evacuations it causes Instead of discussing this Point give me leave to make an Observation or two upon the Antiquity of this Dis ease which I the rather choose to do because Caelius Aurelianus in his Account of it does not seem to build so much upon the Authority of Homer as in my humble Opinion he might have done Indeed he quotes a Passage out of the eighth Iliad249 Iliad where Teucer calls Hector   but does not seem to think this sufficient to prove that Homer was acquainted with this Madness But he omits two more Passages in the same Author which joined with this amount to a Demonstra tion that Homer was by no means ignorant of it The first is in the ninth Iliad where Ulysses is up on his Embassy to Achilles He describes to the last mentioned Hero the Distress the Grecian Ar my was in through his Absence and when he has painted Hector as terrible as he can he compares his Fury to the Rage of a Mad Dog Iliad Lib ix l 237      Hector vero valde trucibus oculis ad spiciens Furit terribiliter fretus Jove nec quicquam honorat Viros neque Deos ingens autem ipsum rabies invasit If Homer had designd to describe a Mad Dog as a Physician he could not have expressd his Looks by a more proper Word than  It must also be considerd that this Discourse is directed to Achilles who having studied Physick under Chiron was consequently more capable of receiving an Idea of the Mischief Hector did to his Countrymen by this Metaphor In the thirteenth Iliad Hector is again calld  by Neptune It must be observd that   and  can properly and in their natural Signifi cation250 cation be applied to no other Madness than that which is peculiar to a Dog though metaphorically it may as in the Instances I have given as also in Sophoclis and Euripides The Word  or  is used to signify the Madness of Dogs by Aristotle Galen and Dioscorides And   is used by the last mentioned Author to signify a Man bit by a Mad Dog  is used by Aretaeus in this Sense and  by Plutarch to express the same Thing What I would infer from this is that Homer was certainly acquainted with the Madness of Dogs and if Dogs in his Days ran mad tis probable they would bite Men and if so to be sure an Hydro phobia would be the Consequence notwithstanding that Plutarch will have it that it was first taken Notice of in the Days of Asclepiades who was fa mous for his Practice in Rome before the Death of Mithridates Another strong Evidence of its Antiquity is that Instinct which directs every Dog to avoid him that is mad upon smelling seeing or even hearing him If this is not Instinct it is Reason and that in a higher Degree than we ourselves can pretend to Now Instinct must be coeval with the Creation or at least the Fall and therefore Madness must not be much younger I heartily ask Pardon for taking up so much of your Time from Business of much greater Import and I beg Leave to subscribe myself S I R Your most obedient humble Servant R O B E R T J A M

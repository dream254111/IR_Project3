J100587,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16831775,104818,OF THE VARIOUS GENERA AND SPECIES OF MUSIC AMONG THE ANCIENTS WITH SOME OBSERVATIONS CONCERNING THEIR SCALE IN A LETTER FROM JOHN CHRISTOPH PEPUSCH MUSIC D  FRS TO MR ABRAHAM DE MOIVRE F R S,I206909,III OF THE VARIOUS GENERA AND SPECIES OF MUSIC AMONG THE ANCIENTS WITH SOME OB SERVATIONS CONCERNING THEIR SCALE IN A LET TER FROM JOHN CHRISTOPH PEPUSCH MUSIC D  F R S TO MR ABRAHAM DE MOIVRE F R S S I R IN COMPLIANCE WITH YOUR REQUEST I HERE SEND YOU SOME OF MY THOUGHTS ON THE VARIOUS GENERA AND SPECIES OF THE GREEK MU SIC READ NOV 13 1746 BERE PRINTED WITH ALTERATIONS267 SIC WHAT THEY WERE AND HOW FAR THE DOCTRINE OF THE ANCIENTS IN THIS RESPECT IS RECONCILEABLE WITH THE TRUE NATURE OF MUSICAL SOUNDS ARE YOU KNOW QUE STIONS WHICH HAVE NOT A LITTLE PERPLEXED THE LEARNED THAT MUSICAL INTERVALS ARE FOUNDED ON CERTAIN RA TIOS OR PROPORTIONS EXPRESSIBLE IN NUMBERS IS AN OLD DISCOVERY NOBODY IS BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THESE PROPORTIONS THAN YOURSELF AND I AM NOT A LITTLE OBLIGED TO YOU FOR THE LIGHT YOU HAVE HEREIN GIVEN ME IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT ALL MUSICAL RATIOS MAY BE ANALYSED INTO THE PRIME NUMBERS 2 3 AND 5 AND THAT ALL INTERVALS MAY BE FOUND FROM THE OCTAVE FIFTH AND THIRD MAJOR WHICH RESPECTIVELY CORRESPOND TO THOSE NUMBERS THESE ARE THE MUSICIANS ELE MENTS FROM THE VARIOUS COMBINATIONS OF WHICH ALL THE AGREEABLE VARIETY OF RELATIONS OF SOUNDS RESULT THIS SYSTEM IS SO WELL SOUNDED ON EXPERIENCE THAT WE MAY LOOK UPON IT AS THE STANDARD OF TRUTH EVERY INTERVAL THAT OCCURS IN MUSIC IS GOOD OR BAD AS IT APPROACHES TO OR DEVIATES FROM WHAT IT OUGHT TO BE ON THESE PRINCIPLES THE DOCTRINE OF SOME OF THE ANCIENTS SEEMS DIFFERENT WHOEVER LOOKS INTO THE NUMBERS GIVEN US BY PTOLEMY WILL NOT ONLY FIND THE PRIMES 2 3 AND 5 BUT 7 11 C INTRODUCED NAY HE SEEMS TO THINK ALL FOURTHS GOOD PROVIDED THEIR COMPONENT INTERVALS MAY BE EXPRESSED BY SUPERPARTI CULAR RATIOS BUT THESE ARE JUSTLY EXPLODED CON CEITS AND IT SEEMS NOT IMPROBABLE THAT THE CONTRA DICTIONS OF DIFFERENT NUMERICAL HYPOTHESES EVEN IN THE AGE OF ARISTOXENUS AND THEIR INCONSISTENCY WITH EXPERIENCE MIGHT LEAD HIM TO REJECT THEIR NUMBERS ALTOGETHER IT IS PITY HE DID HAD HE MADE A PRO PER USE OF THEM WE SHOULD HAVE HAD A CLEARER INSIGHT INTO268 INTO THE MUSIC OF HIS TIMES HOWEVER WHAT RE MAINS OF THE WRITINGS OF THIS GREAT MUSICIAN JOINED TO MY OWN OBSERVATION AND EXPERIENCE HAS ENABLED ME I HOPE TO THROW SOME LIGHT UPON THE OBSCURE SUBJECT OF THE ANCIENT SPECIES OF MUSIC BY THE MANNER IN WHICH EUCLID AND OTHERS FIND THE NOTES OF THEIR SCALE IT MUST HAVE BEEN COM POSED OF TONES MAJOR AND LIMMAS HENCE THE SEVEN INTERVALS OF ONE OCTAVE WOULD BE THUS EXPRESSED IN NUMBERS 98 256243 98 98 256243 98 98 SOME MODERN AUTHORS HAVE FROM THIS INFERRED THE IMPERFECTION OF THE GREEK MUSIC THEY ALLEDGE WE HERE FIND THE DITONUS OR AN INTERVAL EQUAL TO TWO TONES MAJOR EXPRESSED BY 8164 INSTEAD OF THE TRUE THIRD MAJOR EXPRESSED BY 54 AS THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION OF THE BEAUTY AND ELEGANCE OF THE LATTER THE FORMER THEREFORE MUST BE OUT OF TUNE AND OUT OF TUNE BY A WHOLE COMMA WHICH IS VERY SHOCK ING TO THE EAR IN LIKE MANNER THE TRIHEMITONE OF THE ANCIENTS FALLS SHORT OF THE THIRD MINOR BY A COMMA WHICH IS ALSO THE DEFICIENCY OF THEIR HEMI TONE OR LIMMA FROM THE TRUE SEMITONE MAJOR SO ESSENTIAL TO GOOD MELODY THESE ERRORS WOULD MAKE THEIR SCALE APPEAR MUCH OUT OF TUNE TO US THIS I READILY GRANT AND ADD THAT IT APPEARED OUT OF TUNE TO THEM SINCE THEY EXPRESLY TELL US THAT THE INTERVALS LESS THAN THE DIATESSARON OR FOURTH AS ALSO THE INTERVALS BETWEEN THE FIFTH AND OCTAVE WERE DIS SONANT AND DISAGREEABLE TO THE EAR THEIR SCALE WHICH HAS BEEN CALLED BY SOME THE SCALA MAXIMA WAS NOT INTENDED TO FORM THE VOICE TO SING ACCU RATELY BUT WAS DESIGNED TO REPRESENT THE SYSTEM OF THEIR MODES AND TONES AND TO GIVE THE TRUE FOURTHS AND269 AND FIFTHS OF EVERY KEY A COMPOSER MIGHT CHOOSE NOW IF INSTEAD OF TONES MAJOR AND LIMMAS WE TAKE THE TONES MAJOR AND MINOR WITH THE SEMITONE MAJOR AS THE MODERNS CONTEND WE SHOULD WE SHALL HAVE A GOOD SCALE INDEED BUT A SCALE ADAPTED ONLY TO THE CONCINNOUS CONSTITUTION OF ONE KEY AND WHEN EVER WE PROCEED FROM THAT INTO ANOTHER WE FIND SOME FOURTH OR FIFTH ERRONEOUS BY A COMMA THIS THE ANCIENTS DID NOT ADMIT OF IF TO DIMINISH SUCH ERRORS WE INTRODUCE A TEMPERATURE WE SHALL HAVE NOTHING IN TUNE BUT THE OCTAVE WE SEE THEN THE SCALE OF THE ANCIENTS WAS NOT DESTITUTE OF REASON AND THAT NO GOOD ARGUMENT AGAINST THE ACCURACY OF THEIR PRACTICE CAN FROM THENCE BE FORMED IT WAS USUAL AMONG THE GREEKS TO CONSIDER A DE SCENDING AS WELL AS AN ASCENDING SCALE THE FORMER PROCEEDING FROM ACUTE TO GRAVE PRECISELY BY THE SAME INTERVALS AS THE LATTER DID FROM GRAVE TO ACUTE THE FIRST SOUND IN EACH WAS THE PROSLAMBANOMENOS THE NOT DISTINGUISHING THESE TWO SCALES HAS LED SEVERAL LEARNED MODERNS TO SUPPOSE THAT THE GREEKS IN SOME CENTURIES TOOK THE PROSLAMBANOMENOS TO BE THE LOWEST NOTE IN THEIR SYSTEM AND IN OTHER CENTURIES TO BE THE HIGHEST BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT THE PROSLAMBANOMENOS WAS THE LOWEST OR HIGHEST NOTE AC CORDING AS THEY CONSIDERED THE ASCENDING OR DESCENDING SCALE THE DISTINCTION OF THESE IS CONDUCIVE TO THE VARIETY AND PERFECTION OF MELODY BUT I NEVER YET MET WITH ABOVE ONE PIECE OF MUSIC WHERE THE COMPOSER APPEARED TO HAVE ANY INTELLIGENCE OF THIS KIND THE COMPOSITION IS ABOUT 150 OR MORE YEARS OLD FOR FOUR VOICES AND THE WORDS ARE VOBIS DA TUM EST NOSCERE MYSTERIUM REGNI DEI CAETERIS AUTEM AUTHOR270 IN PARABOLIS UT VIDENTES NON VIDEANT ET AUDIENTES NON INTELLIGANT BY THE CHOICE OF THE WORDS THE AUTHOR SEEMS TO ALLUDE TO HIS HAVING PERFORMED SOME THING NOT COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD I SHALL HERE GIVE YOU AN OCTAVE ONLY OF THE ASCEND ING AND DESCENDING SCALES OF THE DIATONIC GENUS OF THE ANCIENTS WITH THE NAMES FOR THEIR SEVERAL SOUNDS AS ALSO THE CORRESPONDING MODERN LETTERS ASCENDING DESCENDING A PROSLAMBANOMENOS G 98 89 B HYPATE HYPATON F 256243 243256 C PARHYPATE HYPATON E 98 89 D LYCHANOS HYPATON D 98 89 E HYPATE MESON C 256243 243256 F PARHYPATE MESON B 98 89 G LYCHANOS MESON A 98 89 A MESE G WHERE YOU SEE THE SAME GREEK NAMES SERVE FOR THE SOUNDS IN THE ASCENDING AND DESCENDING SCALES IN THE OCTAVE HERE GIVEN FOUR SOUNDS VIZ THE PROSLAMBANOMENOS HYPATE HYPATON HYPATE MESON AND MESE WERE CALLED STABILES FROM THEIR REMAIN ING FIXED THROUGHOUT ALL THE GENERA AND SPECIES THE OTHER FOUR SOUNDS BEING THE PARHYPATE HYPA TON LYCHANOS HYPATON PARHYPATE MESON AND THE LYCHANOS271 LYCHANOS MESON WERE CALLED MOBILES BECAUSE THEY VARIED ACCORDING TO THE DIFFERENT SPECIES AND VARIE TIES OF MUSIC I COME NOW TO DETERMINE THE QUESTION WHAT THESE DIFFERENT GENERA AND SPECIES WERE YOU KNOW THAT BY GENUS AND SPECIES WAS UNDERSTOOD A DIVISION OF THE DIATESSARON CONTAINING FOUR SOUNDS INTO THREE INTERVALS THE GREEKS CONSTITUTED THREE GENERA KNOWN BY THE NAMES OF ENHARMONIC CHROMATIC AND DIATONIC THE CHROMATIC WAS SUBDIVIDED INTO THREE SPECIES AND THE DIATONIC INTO TWO THE THREE CHRO MATIC SPECIES WERE THE CHROMATICUM MOLLE THE SESQUIALTERUM AND THE TONIAEUM THE TWO DIATONIC SPECIES WERE THE DIATONICUM MOLLE AND THE INTEN SUM SO THAT THEY HAD SIX SPECIES IN ALL SOME OF THESE ARE IN USE AMONG THE MODERNS BUT OTHERS ARE AS YET UNKNOWN IN THEORY OR PRACTICE I NOW PROCEED TO DEFINE ALL THESE SPECIES BY DE TERMINING THE INTERVALS OF WHICH THEY SEVERALLY CON SISTED BEGINNING BY THE DIATONICUM INTENSUM AS THE MOST EASY AND FAMILIAR THE DIATONICUM INTENSUM WAS COMPOSED OF TWO TONES AND A SEMITONE BUT TO SPEAK EXACTLY IT CONSISTS OF A SEMITONE MAJOR A TONE MINOR AND A TONE MAJOR THIS IS IN DAILY PRACTICE AND WE FIND IT ACCURATELY DEFINED BY DIDYMUS IN PTOLEMYS HARMONICS PUBLISHED BY DR WALLIS THE NEXT SPECIES IS THE DIATONICUM MOLLE AS YET UNDISCOVERED AS FAR AS APPEARS TO ME BY ANY MODERN AUTHOR ITS COMPONENT INTERVALS ARE THE SEMITONE MAJOR AN INTERVAL COMPOSED OF TWO SEMITONES MI NOR AND THE COMPLEMENT OF THESE TWO TO THE FOURTH BEING M M272 BEING AN INTERVAL EQUAL TO A TONE MAJOR AND AN EN HARMONIC DIESIS THE THIRD SPECIES IS THE CHROMATICUM TONIAEUM ITS COMPONENT INTERVALS ARE A SEMITONE MAJOR SUC CEEDED BY ANOTHER SEMITONE MAJOR AND LASTLY THE COMPLEMENT OF THESE TWO TO THE FOURTH COMMONLY CALLED A SUPERFLUOUS TONE THE FOURTH SPECIES IS THE CHROMATICUM SESQUI ALTERUM WHICH IS CONSTITUTED BY THE PROGRESSION OF A SEMITONE MAJOR A SEMITONE MINOR AND A THIRD MINOR THIS IS MENTIONED BY PTOLEMY AS THE CHRO MATIC OF DIDYMUS EXAMPLES AMONG THE MODERNS ARE FREQUENT THE FIFTH SPECIES IS THE CHROMATICUM MOLLE ITS INTERVALS ARE TWO SUBSEQUENT SEMITONES MINOR AND THE COMPLEMENTS OF THESE TWO TO THE FOURTH THAT IS AN INTERVAL COMPOUNDED OF A THIRD MINOR AND AN ENHARMONIC DIESIS THIS SPECIES I NEVER MET WITH AMONG THE MODERNS THE SIXTH AND LAST SPECIES IS THE ENHARMONIC SALI NAS AND OTHERS HAVE DETERMINED THIS ACCURATELY ITS INTERVALS ARE THE SEMITONE MINOR THE ENHARMONICA DIESIS AND THE THIRD MAJOR EXAMPLES OF FOUR OF THESE SPECIES MAY BE FOUND IN MODERN PRACTICE BUT I DO NOT KNOW OF ANY THEO RIST WHO EVER YET DETERMINED WHAT THE CHROMATICUM TONIAEUM OF THE ANCIENTS WAS NOR HAVE ANY OF THEM PERCEIVED THE ANALOGY BETWEEN THE CHROMATICUM SES QUIALTERUM AND OUR MODERN CHROMATIC THE ENHAR MONIC SO MUCH ADMIRED BY THE ANCIENTS HAS BEEN LIT TLE IN USE AMONG OUR MUSICIANS AS YET AS TO THE DIA TONICUM INTENSUM IT IS TOO OBVIOUS TO BE MISTAKEN 6 ARISTOXENUS273 ARISTOXENUS AND OTHERS OFTEN MENTION THE TONE AS DIVIDED INTO FOUR PARTS AND THE SEMITONE INTO TWO THEREBY MAKING TEN DIVISIONS OR DIESES IN THE FOURTH AND THIS IS TRUE IF WE CONSIDER THESE SOUNDS IN ONE TENSION THAT IS EITHER ASCENDING OR DESCENDING BUT ACCURATELY SPEAKING WHEN WE CON SIDER ALL THE DIESES OR DIVISIONS OF THE FOURTH BOTH ASCENDING AND DESCENDING WE SHALL FIND THIRTEEN FIVE TO EACH TONE AND THREE TO THE SEMITONE MAJOR BUT THEN IT IS TO BE OBSERVED THAT SOME OF THESE DIVISIONS WILL BE LESS THAN THE ENHARMONIC DIESIS FOR IF WE DIVIDE THE SEMITONE MAJOR INTO THE SEMITONE MINOR AND ENHARMONIC DIESIS ASCENDING FOR INSTANCE E  E F AND THEN DIVIDE IN LIKE MANNER DESCENDING F B F E WE SHALL HAVE THE SEMITONE MAJOR DIVIDED INTO THREE PARTS THUS E B F  E F WHERE THE INTERVAL BETWEEN B F AND  E IS LESS THAN THE ENHAR MONIC DIESIS BETWEEN E AND B F AND BETWEEN  E AND F AS IS EASILY PROVED NOW IF WE SUPPOSE THESE SMALL INTERVALS EQUAL BY INCREASING THE LEAST DIVISION AND DIMINISHING THE TRUE ENHARMONIC DIESIS WE SHALL THEN HAVE A FOURTH DIVIDED INTO THIRTEEN EQUAL PARTS AND CONSEQUENTLY THE OCTAVE DIVIDED INTO THREE SUCH EQUAL PARTS WHICH GIVES US THE CELEBRATED TEMPERATURE OF HUYGENS THE MOST PERFECT OF ALL FROM THIS IT APPEARS THAT THE DIVISION OF THE OCTAVE INTO 31 PARTS WAS NECESSARILY IMPLIED IN THE DOCTRINE OF THE ANCIENTS THE FIRST OF THE MODERNS WHO MENTIONED SUCH A DIVISION WAS DON VINCENTINO IN HIS BOOK INTITLED LANTICA MUSICA RIDOTTA ALLA MODERNA PRATTICA PRINTED AT ROME 1555 FOLIO AN INSTRUMENT HAD BEEN MADE ACCORDING TO HIS NOTION WHICH WAS CONDEMNED BY ZARLINO AND SALINAS WITH M M 2 OUT274 OUT SUFFICIENT REASON BUT MR HUYGENS HAVING MORE ACCURATELY EXAMINED THE MATTER FOUND IT TO BE THE BEST TEMPERATURE THAT COULD BE CONTRIVED THO NEITHER THIS GREAT MATHEMATICIAN NOR ZARLINO SALI NAS NOR EVEN DON VINCENTINO SEEM TO HAVE HAD A DISTINCT NOTION OF ALL THESE THIRTYONE INTERVALS NOR OF THEIR NAMES NOR OF THEIR NECESSITY TO THE PER FECTION OF MUSIC I MUST OBSERVE TO YOU THAT I RECEIVED SOME TIME AGO A MANUSCRIPT FROM FLORENCE WHERE A MUSICIAN OF THAT CITY HAD RIGHTLY NAMED THESE INTERVALS OF THE OCTAVE I FOUND THEIR NAMES YOU KNOW MANY YEARS AGO IN HUYGENSS TEMPERATURE THE TONES ARE ALL EQUAL BUT IN A TRUE AND ACCURATE PRACTICE OF SINGING THEY ARE NOT SO AND I MUST ADD THAT THE TONE DIVIDED IN EVERY SPECIES MUST BE THE TONE MINOR FOR THE DIVISION OF THE TONE MAJOR IS HARSH AND INELEGANT SO THAT IN THE DIVISION OF THE FOURTH IT IS TO BE OB SERVED THAT IN EVERY SPECIES THE TONE MAJOR MUST EITHER BE AN UNDIVIDED INTERVAL OR MAKE PART OF ONE YOU MAY PERHAPS WONDER HOW THE FOREGOING DOC TRINE CAN BE FOUND IN THE WRITINGS OF THE ANCIENTS SINCE THE DISTINCTION OF TONES INTO MAJOR AND MINOR IS NO WHERE MENTIOND IN THEIR WRITINGS BUT IT IS TO BE OBSERVED THAT THOUGH THE TERMS DO NOT OCCUR YET THE THING ITSELF WAS NOT UNKNOWN TO THEM I OWN THEY HAVE NOT EXPRESSED THEMSELVES FULLY YET FROM THE WHOLE OF THEIR WRITINGS COME TO OUR HANDS I THINK THE DOCTRINE BEFORE LAID DOWN MAY BE WELL SUPPORTED BUT AS IT WOULD REQUIRE SOME TIME TO PUT THIS IN A JUST LIGHT I MUST DEFER IT TO ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY I AM C IV

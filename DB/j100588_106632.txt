transit of Mercury was to happen a few days after my arrival at this place from England Although I brought no astronomical instruments with me I wished to observe this phaenomenon and upon application to M THYSBAERT President du College Royal a very distinguished Member of this University he supplied me in the politest manner with the following instruments and a convenient place for the ob servation He carried his attention to the most trifling circum stances in order to make my situation in every respect agreeable The instruments he provided me with were a Gregorian reflector of 21 inches focal length with an aperture of 412 inches the magnifying power of which I esteemed about 70 or 80 with a good quadrant 18 inches radius and a com pound pendulum clock steadily fixed beating dead seconds These instruments were made in London and used for the observationMr N PIGOTTS Observation of the Transit of Mercury 385 observation of Mercury The rate of the clock and the appa rent times thence deduced were obtained by equal altitudes of the sun taken with the quadrant These were the only in struments I had and therefore such observations as are not dependent on the measure of time are to be considered as made by estimation however the most important the internal and external contacts of Mercury and hence the egress of his center and the interval of time between the two contacts were made in a very satisfactory manner About six oclock when I attended for the observation there being a great number of solar spots Mercury might easily have been mistaken for one but his motion soon removed every doubt in that respect Flying clouds obscured the sun at intervals but during the last half hour the weather was fine the sky clear the limb of the sun well defined Mercury round and very black There seems to have been some mistake in respect of this phaenome non either in the calculation or the printing of the Con noissance des Temps of this year the emersion of the center of Mercury is there set down at 19 h 45 apparent time at Paris whereas by my observation the egress of the center at Lou vain was at 20 h 47 28 or 29 apparent time Taking here no other equation into consideration except the difference of meridians between Paris and Louvain which by a great number of observations I determined in 1775 to be 9 37 in time  the emersion of the center at Paris must have been at 20 h 37 51 or 52 which differs nearly 53 from the com puted time By the same reasoning I should suppose that the emersion of the center of Mercury at Greenwich was ob served at 20 h 28 35 or 36 Mercury being so very near  See Philosophical Transactions vol LXVIII p 654 the386 Mr N PIGOTTS Observation of the earth the effects of parallax must be considerable and the western situation of Greenwich of 18 53 in time from this place must occasion a retardation which on computation may be hereafter allowed for and added to the supposed time of the egress abovementioned deduced from my observation here While I am writing this Paper the respective situation of Greenwich and Louvain strikes me The latitude of Green wich is 51 28 40 that of Louvain 50 53 3  the dif ference little more than half a degree Greenwich is 9 16 west and Louvain 9 37 east of the Paris Observatory the parallax abovementioned is therefore nearly but in a contrary sense equal at the two places and thus the effects of both are compensated relatively to Paris What other advantage may result from this circumstance would require consideration I have not leisure at present to revolve it in my mind as I am desirous to lay this Paper before the Royal Society as soon as I can by the favour of Dr MASKELYNE our Astronomer Royal  See Philosophical Transactions vol LXVIII p 643

time and the duration of total egress was 3 m 35 s N B The reasons why the nine first observations are all marked at 30 is that in reality they were set down at the minute only and that I have added 2 30 to each to reduce the time by the clock to apparent time more nicety would have been superfluous but the four last were rigorously computed

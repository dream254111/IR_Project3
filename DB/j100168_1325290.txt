equity be the owner of realty the legal title being held by one or more partners in trust for the firm1 On the basis of this equitable recognition of the firm as an entity it would seem that the character of a partners right in firm realty is dependent not upon any fiction of conversion of realty into personalty but rather upon a determination whether the firm owned the entire title or had merely during the firm existence the use of the property with a power of sale for firm purposes2 In the former case the partners right is not to any specific property but merely to an accounting and being thus a mere chose in action it should be governed in its descent and transfer by the rules ap plicable to personalty3 But if the firm has only the use of the property the individual partners interest in remainder in the unconsumed realty is a right in realty and must be governed in its descent and transfer by the rules applicable to real estate4 The courts have however worked out the rights of the partners and of their representatives on the basis of an implied trust to sell for firm pur poses In England in the absence of agreement to the contrary there is an implied agreement that all property shall be sold in winding up the firm This is held in equity to deprive the partner of any real interest in land owned by the firm regardless of the state of the legal title and is generally spoken of as out and out conversion5 In this country the presumed agreement is that the realty shall be sold only so far as may be necessary for firm purposes6 There are two views as to the effect of this i The partner has no specific interest in firm realty until it is determined that the land is not needed for firm purposes7 2 The land remains that of the partners as individuals but may be sold so far as is necessary to satisfy firm needs8 Either of these views sustains the holding of a recent case that there may be partition of firm realty not needed in the settlement of firm accounts and that the heirs or devisees of a deceased partner may bring the bill Schleissner v Goldsticker 120 N Y Supp 333 Sup Ct App Div As to the right to demand an exoneration of the firm realty by the personalty there is some conflict9 Hartnett v Stillwell 121 Ga 386 Henry v Anderson 77 Ind 361 Shanks v Klein 104 U S I8 2 Cf Beales note PARSONS ON PARTNERSHIP 4 ed 360 Smith v Smith 5 Ves I88

realty many refuse to recognize it as a present right in real estate0 and hold that a partners interest in a firm owning realty may be transferred as personalty1 that the wives have no inchoate right of dower12 and that judgments against the individual partners do not affect their interest in firm realtyl3 In explaining these decisions the courts have advanced the doctrine that the partners interest is personalty during the firms existence and is not reconverted into realty until it is deter mined that it will be unnecessary to sell the land in winding up the firm Such a result seems opposed to the cases which decide that the nature of a cestuis right for purposes of descent is determined at his deceasel4 Fur thermore it is of doubtful propriety where no writing evidences such an agreement15 SUIT UNDER FOREIGN STATUTE GIVING THE PERSONAL REPRESENTA TIVE THE RIGHT TO RECOVER FOR DEATH BY WRONGFUL ACT  It is established by the weight of authority that as a general rule suit may be brought in a foreign jurisdiction upon a cause of action arising under a statute giving damage for death by wrongful act As the obligation sued on is raised wholly by the statute of the place where the injury occurred that statute governs as to the party to bring suit2 When the statute gives the right of action to the personal representative of the deceased inas much as there may be different administrators in different jurisdictions a further question arises as to which administrator should sue Perhaps the most probable intent of a legislature in using the phrase personal representative is to designate the representative appointed in its own state that is in the locus delicti since such a statute applies only to death caused within the jurisdiction3 Certainly no case has arisen in which a court in construing its own statute has so interpreted it as to deny a right of action to the administrator of the locus delicti 4 and in this as in other cases of statutory interpretation the construction given to a statute by the courts of the jurisdiction in which the statute was passed should be 0 But see Shearer v Shearer supra Hewitt v Rankin 41 Ia 35 1 Greenwood v Marvin IIi N Y 423

Vertebrae,i207006, 719  XXXI On the MEGATHERIUM JMegatherium Americanum BLUMENBACH By Professor OWEN FRS 8fc Part IPreliminary Observations on the Exogenous Processes of Vertebre Received November 8 1850Read January 9 1851 BEFORE entering upon the description of the skeleton of the Megatherium it is requisite to premise some remarks on the vertebrae of the Mammalia in general Hitherto these parts have been described by means of the terms supplied by Human Anatomy But the skeleton of Man is one which deviates most from the common archetype some parts are developed in excess other parts which are present as a general rule in the Mammalian series are either rudimental or absent The latter is more particularly the case with those processes of the vertebrae which are developed in relation to the attachment and force of the muscles and which being connected with particular modes and media of motion become eminently significative of the habits and affinities of the species The consideration and comparison of these processes therefore most of which have received no names in Human Anatomy are essential to a right determination of the habits and affinities of the Megatherium and in order to make intelligible the terms in which the vertebral peculiarities of that great extinct animal will be described I propose first to illustrate them by giving a comparative survey of the principal modifications of the exogenous processes in the vertebrate series The exogenous processes of a vertebra are those which grow out of the pre viously ossified parts and are so classified and named in contradistinction from the autogenous parts or elements of a vertebra which are developed from their own proper centres of ossification In the sixth cervical vertebra for example of the human foetus the part which SOEMMERRING the most exact and classical autlhor on Anthropotomy calls iradix prior seu antica processus transversi vertebraet is developed fiom a separate centre and for some time continues to be a distinct bar of bone whilst the part called  radix postica processus transversi vertebrae grows out of the base of the  radix arcus posterioris  as SOEMMERRING denominates the autogenous part which I have called neurapophysis and from this element or from the arch formed by its coalesence with its fellow when it constitutes the arcus posterior vertebrae of SOEMMERRING other processes grow out as for example the processus obliqui seu  On the Plesiosaurus macrocephalus Geological Transactions vol v 2nd series p 518 1838 t De Corporis Humani Fabrica 8vo 1794 tom i pp 239

direction when traced through the vertebrate series in the course of which comparison the anatomist meets with other exogenous processes traceable with equal certainty from species to species and determinable under all their various modifications whence it becomes necessary for the purpose of brief and clear description to indicate each of such processes by a single definite name capable of being formed into an adjective to express the pro perties or appendages of such processes The convenience of such terms will be admitted by the Human Anatomist who considers that the processes in question have as yet received no distinct substantive names in Anthropotomy and who knows from Osteogeny how vaguely some of the descriptive terms as transverse process for example are applied to parts obviously very different in their nature and constitution The transverse process of a dorsal vertebra is a simple exogenous growth from the neurapophysis commonly affording an articular surface for a rib the  transverse process of a sacral vertebraf is an autogenous part which continues distinct long after birth the transverse process of a cervical vertebra is partly exogenous partly autogenous consisting in fact of two distinct processes and a rudimental rib but distinguished in Anthropotomy from other transverse processes only by being perforated But if such common phrase of  transverse process with a note of distinction as that it is perforated in the cervical vertebrae be sufficient for the exigencies and applications of Human Anatomy it becomes quite inadequate and often totally inap plicable to the answerable parts in the lower animals in the Crocodile for example the cervical rib is much more developed and maintains constantly a free articulation by a head with a welldeveloped inferior transverse process  radix antica SOEMM and by a tubercle with an equally distinct superior transverse process  radix pos tica SOEMM In the Wombat Plate XLIV fig 12 the Hare the Pig and most other quadrupeds the transverse process of the lumbar vertebrae consists of an exogenous base and an autogenous apex this apex being as THEILE and MULLER have shown a rudimental rib like the autogenous part of the transverse process in the neck In entering upon the descriptions of the extinct species of the Reptilian class the most varied extraordinary and heteroclite as

fossil remains consisted of vertebrae or parts of vertebrae and that a definite idea of these complex bones with a substantive nomenclature for their parts was indispensable in order to give a clear and intelligible description of them In a memoir on the Plesiosaurus macrocephalus read before the Geological Society April 1838 I therefore defined the parts of the typical vertebra distinguished the autogenous elements from the exogenous parts and proposed the nomenclature which I have since used and further illustrated in subsequent works Referring more particularly to my  Lectures on the Comparative Anatomy of the Vertebrate Animals and my work On the Archetype of the Vertebrate Skeletont for the fuller exposition of the views entertained by anatomists on the nature of the vertebra it is sufficient for the present purpose to remark that the term parapophysis was proposed for the inferior transverse process or  anterior root of the perforated transverse process of the cer vical vertebrae the term diapophysis for the superior tlansverse process or posterior root of the perforated transverse process and the tetrm  pleurapophysis for that element which essentially the same in different regions of the spine is short styliform and speedily anchylosed in the neck of Man is remarkable for its length and freedom of motion in the back and is as remarkable for its breadth thickness and wedged fixedness in the sacrunm which is hatchetshaped and free in the neck of the Crocodile and Plesiosaurus and is as broad and flat in the first dorsal seg ment of a Whale as the ordinary mammalian scapula or any of the flat bones in Anthropotomy The necessity for a definite technical term for this vertebral element was the greater because the name costa or rib has not only been withheld in Human Anatomy from the element in question under every modification save that in which it retains its individuality and mobility with a certain length and slenderness but it has been extended to another and quite distinct element viz the haemapophysis which from being commonly cartilaginous in the thorax of Man has obtained the namne of cartilage of the rib or pars cartilaginea costee As this part however is most commonly a distinct ossified part in the airbreathing Vertebrata it has been called in Comparative Anatomy the sternal rib in contradistinction to the vertebral rib or pars ossea costae of Anthropotomy Both however are distinct elements of the vertebra in its true or wider anatomical sense each may exist independ ently of the other and the haemapophysis is often present in other regions besides the sternal or thoracic one The subject however of the present communication being the exogenous parts of the vertebrae I shall return to it by remarking that in Human Anatomy other processes have been recognized besides the spine the zygapophysis oblique or articular process the diapophysis transverse process and radix postica in the neck and the  parapophysis part of the  radix antica in the neck MONRO for 721 t 8vo VAN VOORST 1848  8vo LONGMANS 1846PROFESSOR OWEN ON THE MEGATHERIUM example the first exact describer of Human Osteology when treating of the lumbar vertebrae observes5 Betwixt the roots of the superior oblique and transverse processes a small rising may be observed where some of the musculi erectores trunci corporis are fixed And SOEMMERRING bears testimony to the accuracy of MONROS observation of this small rising as a constant part by calling it  processus accessorius processui transverso et articulari superiori interpositust There are in fact two such accessory processes as SOEMMERRING indeed seems to indicate One of these small risings or accessory processes although it seems so insignificant and is so small as to be commonly passed over without notice in our modern an thropotomical compilations is not only so constant as to merit unfailing notice in the human subject but in extending our comparisons from Man to the lower mam malia we find it speedily in the Quadrumanous Order for example gaining a de veloprnent which makes it in the dorsal and lumbar regions miore conspicuous than the articular processes themselves whence CUVIER observing its relation to the anterior of these processes calls it une seconde apophyse articulaire  and M DE BLAINVILLE struck rather wittl the shape of the process calls it  apophyse styloide 1  whilst M STRAUSDURCKHEIM regarding it as a sort of accessory transverse process prefers to call it apophyse plagiennes  I have termed it the anapophysis The second tubercle is usually a somewhat larger process situated between the diapo physis and the upper or anterior zygapophysis it is equally constant in certain ver tebrae in Man and attains in some mammals the Armadillos for instance as great a length as the spinous process itself The part in Man to which I allude is that which the accurate BOURGERY has depicted in his beautiful plates and indicated as the face rugueuse de lapophyse articulaire superieurett STRAUSDURCKHEIM mtiistakes it for the superior articular process itself in the feline quadrupeds calls it apophyse antoblique and denies the existence of anterior oblique processes in the third to the ninth dorsal vertebra inclusive which do in fact possess the articulating surfaces so called but want the accessory process which becomes so markedly deve loped in the posterior dorsal and lumbar vertebrae For this accessory process I hiave proposed the name of metapophysisfl and have noticed some of its modifica  The Anatomy of

Aurochs in which as in most other Ruminants the anapophysis is not present  The process which is developed sometimes singly sometimes in pairs from the under part of the centruin in some mammals and in most birds and reptiles I have called hypapophysisf I propose in the first place to trace the homologies and to indicate the chief modi fications of the metapophyses and anapophyses in the mammalian class and thereby to vindicate their title to distinct names and demonstrate the utility if not the necessity of such signs for parts so constant in existence and so variable in character in a great proportion of that class I may remark also that as I shall fiequently have to allude to the anterior as distinct ftom the posterior zygapophyses I shall call the former  prozygapophysis and use the term zygapophysis simply to signify the posterior pair   With regard to the vertebrae of the trunk of the Aurochs I may remark that the only accessory pro cess in addition to the ordinary zygapophyses and diapophyses is the  metapophysis which appears as a stout tubercle above the diapophysis in the middle dorsals and gradually advances and rises upon the anterior zyg apophyses in the posterior dorsal and lumbar vertebrae This process is developed to an equality of length with the spinous processes in the Armadillos It is commonly associated with another accessory exogenous process to which I have given the name  anapophysis in the Catalogue of the Osteological Series in the Royal Col lege of Surgeons This process which in most of the Rodentia rises at first in common with the metapo physis as a tubercle above the diapophysis separates from the metapophysis as the vertebrwe approach the pelvis and in the lumbar series the anapophysis is seen projecting backwards from the base or a little above the base of the diapophysis its office being usually that of underlapping the anterior zygapophysis of the suc ceeding vertebrw and strengthenling the articulation whence CUVIER has alluded to it as an accessory articular process but its relation to the zygapophysial joint is an occasional and not a constant character The tenth dorsal vertebra of the Sawtoothed Seal Leptonyx

of the socalled  transverse process is plainly demonstrated The diapophysis more over is not suppressed on the last dorsal vertebtra as in some of the Quadrumana Carnivora and Rodentia The serial

process named  transverse in the thoracic vertebrae  that process to which I restrict the namne  diapophysis is continued distinctly into the lumbar region and is there lengthened out by a superadded pleurapophysis which is ossified from a distinct centre in the Wombat but is not so ossified in the human skeleton in which only a mere epiphysis like that at the extremity of the spinous process is superadded to the end of the transverse process of the lumbar vertebrae In the skeleton of the Great Kangaroo Macropus major with d 13 1 6 both  The author of the article Skeleton in the Cyclopmedia of Anatomy and Physiology Part XXXV March 1839 cites p 628 the following passage from my work on the Archetype and Homologies of the Ver tebrate Skeleton Each of the five succeeding segments is represented by the same elements coalesced that constitute the socalled dorsal vertebra they are called lumbar vertebrae they have no ossified pleurapophyses with the following comment Professor OWENs pleurapophysis is the rib or costal appendage of his typical vertebra While he states therefore that the lumbar vertebra has no pleurapophysis he means that it has no rib or costal piece This oversight which with all respect I believe it to be has arisen from the evident error of mistaking the lumbar transverse process as being the counterpart or homologue of the dorsal transverse process which if such were the case would leave the lumbar vertebra without a rib The passage so commented on is taken from a  Section of my work treating of the specialities of the Human Skeleton in the  Section treating on lumbar vertehre in general I state The lumbar vertebre which in some mammals show in the fxetal state distinct rudiments of pleurapophyses more minute than those in the neck have them soon anchylosed to the extremities of the diapophyses which are thus elongated p 94 No one proposing fairly to criticise my opinions on the transverse process of a lumbar vertebra in general ought to have repre sented them by a quotation of a description of the lumbar vertebra of a particular species But taking the passage upon the human skeleton as cited above the conclusion of the Critic that I  leave the lumbar vertebra without a rib can only be sustained by the omission of a word in that passage What I do state is that in them  they have no ossified pleurapophyses Now in a previous part of the work quoted from it is shown that a vertebral element may exist in three states  fibrous  cartilaginous  osseous and that its absence was not to be assumed merely because it had not passed into the bony stage I have never met with a human lumbar vertebra showing the transverse process lengthened out by a distinct autogenous ossification meriting like that of the Wombat Plate XLVII fig 12 L 1 to be regarded as a pleurapophysis the whole is an exogenous outgrowing diapophysis with a minute epiphysis which begins to be ossified about the age of sixteen and is comparable in my opinion with that at the extremity of the metapophysis and neural spine As to the opinion that the transverse process of the dorsal vertebra is homologous with the tubercle of the lumbar vertebra whether by  tubercle is meant the metapophysis or the anapophysis I need only refer to those skeletons of mammalia in which as in the Wombat Kangaroo and Dasyure the true diapophysis is not suppressed on the last dorsal vertebra in order to ensure a conviction in every impartial observer that the exogenous part of the transverse process ofrtebra is the serial homologue or tallying part with the

zygapophyses are overlapped as in other mammals by the posterior zygapophyses in the succeeding dorsals beginning with the seventh the posterior zygapophyses seem to be overlapped and concealed by the

vertical the anterior looking inwards But in the figure which he refers to of the fourth dorsal vertebra ofthe Delphinus Delphis the accurate artist M LAURILLARD represents the metapophyses as distinct fiom the prozygapophysis or anterior articular process although less so than it is in nature and it is incontestably the progressive development of this superadded pro cess which gives rise to the change of position of thle articular surface of the connate prozygapophysis and the metapophysis continues to be developed as the figures in the Ossemens Fossiles detnmonstrate long after the

of the vertebrae present their greatest and most complex developments in this order but by no means with that degree of uniformity which renders their modifications characteristic of some of the preceding Orders The twc extremes in the degree of development are in fact presented by the muchdiversified families of the present extraordinary group of mammals The spinous processes are almost obsolete in a great part of the unusually long dorsolumlbar region of the Twotoed Sloth Bradypus didactylus and the metapo physes would be hardly recognizable if their modifications had not been previously traced in other mammals The first indication of them is seen in the penultimate dorsal vertebra where they appear as angular productions firom the upper and fore part of the diapophyses in the last dorsal they have advanced clear of the diapo physis to the outer side of the prozygapophysis the articular surface of which begins to ascend upon them  and they conltinue as low and long tuberosities above the pro zygapophyses throughout the lumbar region In the sacral vertebrae they are obso lete No anapophyses are developed in this species of Sloth  In assigning with CUVIEn  this formula to the dorsal region of the spine I have been guided by characters which have appeared to me more demonstrative of the homology of the eighth and ninth vertebrae of the Ai with the last two cervicals of other mammals than the sometimes persistent freedom of their short pleurapo physes are of their homology with the first two dorsals The penultimate cervical vertebra for example has a wellmarked and constant character in most mammals in the greater anteroposterior extent of its anchylosed pleurapophysis and I find this character repeated in the eighth vertebra counting from the atlas in the Three toed Sloth Subjoined are the chief particulars which are noticeable in the cervical region of the skeleton of the mature specimen of that species in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons The hindpart of the bodies of the second to the sixth cervical vertebrae inclusive are produced backwards and underlap the forepart of the body of the succeeding vertebrae The transverse process of the atlas is imperforate but the base of the neural arch is pierced by the vertebral artery anteriorly and by the cervical nerve posteriorly The spines of the cervical vertebrae are moderately and more equally developed than in other mammals that of the dentata being little larger than the rest The pleurapophysial part of the transverse process of the eighth cervical is anchylosed and is more extended anteroposteriorly than in the preceding cervicals in which respects it resembles the sixth cervical vertebra in ordinary quadrupeds The pleurapophysial part of the transverse process of the ninth cervical is free and is more extended in the direction of its length but is very short com pared with the homologous part of the succeeding vertebra The slender neck and head of this little rib joining the forepart of its centrum occasions the perforated character of the ninth as in the antecedent cervical ver tebrae In the fourth cervical however the vertebral artery perforates the right transverse process but only grooves the left on its anterior part The transverse processes of the second and third cervical vertebrae are both irnperforate The homology of the vertebra succeeding the ninth with the first dorsal of the Unau and of other mammals is demonstrated by the junction of its rib with the manubrium by the superadded haemapophysial element which is here however ossified and anchylosed with both its pleurapophysis and the manubrium Nine pairs of ribs directly articulat e to t sternum which consists of eight bones these are compressed and progressively in crease in depth The hinder ones are divided into a larger posterior and a smaller anterior part between which are four articulated facets on each side for the bifurcated extremities

the back part of the liapophysis which it equals in length The anapophysis decreases in size in the fol lowing lumbar vertebrae and disappears in the last the metapophysis also decreases in size but is continued throughout the lumbar series and along part of the sacral The transverse processes of the three anterior sacrals join the ilia those of the three posterior ones coalesce to formn a broad depressed plate with the posterior angles produced but not joining the ischia A long and strong process is sent out from above the tuber ischii Metapophyses are developed firom the outside of the ante

Anteater exhibited by Dr MELVILLEi at the meeting of the Zoological Society on December 12 1848 in order to demonstrate that the Edentata had no posterior or backwardly projecting processes from the diapophyses is not of a true Anteater but of an Orycteropus in which although the development of the anapophyses is much less than in the species of Myrmecophaga they are nevertheless sufficiently recognizable In no order of Mammals as I shall presently show are the anapophyses or backwardly projecting processes more extraordinarily developed than in the Edentata MDCCCLI 5 C 741PROFESSOR OWEN ON THE MEGATHERIUM vertebrae The anapophysis a commences on the seventh dorsal projecting back wards behind the base of the diapophysis and presenting on its upper side an arti cular surface for that beneath the base of the succeeding metapophysis The anapo physis increases in length but more so in vertical thickness in the succeeding ver tebrae The diapophysis d subsides to a mere ridge in the last dorsal and disap pears in the lumbar vertebrae where the transverse processes are formed by parapo physes In the penultimate dorsal vertebra the anapophysis is notched posteriorly and developes a small surface from below its inferior division for articulating with the head of the last rib The succeeding anapophysis developes a similar surface for articulating with a short and thick exogenous process or  parapophysis and this complex condition of the anapophysis is continued throughout the lumbar region the last vertebra having a longer and narrower anapophysis Thus on each side of the

esubstantive names for the several processes and applying them adjectively to such modifications as I have described is not one of the least advantages of such substantive names to the descriptive Anatomist Thlese lifferent articulations form double tenonandmortise joints on eacht side of the ver tebrae But their comparison with these joints in artificial carpentry affords but a meagre idea of their true nature and complexitv whilst the supposition of their lhomology with the similar tenonandmortise joints of the t ofbackbone of Serpents is as I shall presently demonstrate unsupported by exact comparison In the Dasypus tricinctus the true or moveable vertebrae present the following amongst other characters The spine of the third cervical has cotmpletely coalesced with that of the dentata which is thick and high but more extended forwards than backwards The spine of the fourth cervical is applied to its back part The neural arches of the succeeding cervicals have no spines but form tllin transverse bars of bone above which are incomplete in the middle at the fifth and sixth cervicals upon which the rest are strongly bent backwards Their bodies are extremnely broad in proportion to their length or anteroposterior diameter The articular bed for the head and tubercle of the first dorsal rib is contributed to in equal shares by the last cervical and first The

surfaces one above for the under part of the metapophysis m another below for the upper part of the parapophysis p Thus the veitebrae are interlocked by tenonandmortise joints as CUVIER has described

the two joints one on the inner and the other on the under side of their base Nothing can be more distinct than the anterior and poste rior zygapophyses of the sixth dorsal vertebra but equally distinct are the met apophyses which coexist with them in the seventh dorsal to confound these two processes or to describe the longer metapophyses in the subsequent vertebrae as developments of the

characters desirable The vertebral formula is seven cervical eleven dorsal three lumbar nine sacral sixteen caudal The second and third cervicals have coalesced together and they develope a strong

lateral mortises behind the vertebra are all of them below the true zygapophyses and are the result of the additional processes called  metapophyses and  anapophyses  whilst a second air of  tenons

intelligibly made known without the use of names for the parts and as I trust that I have shown the parts to be not mere subdivisions of the diapophyses but constant characteristic and independent processes definite names for them cannot be reasonably deprecated as unnecessary Before leaving this part of mny subject I may point out a few of the modifications of the exogenous processes of the vertebrae by which different genera of Ophidia may be distinguished In the genus Coluber Plate LI fig 2932 the diapophysis besides develop ing the articular tubercle d for the rib sends a long process d outwards above that tubercle between it and the prozygapophysis z and a very short process d like a parapophysis downwards below that tubercle the neural spine ns is low in proportion to its anteroposterior extent the zygosphenal surfaces z s are nearly vertical and the zygantra z a are wide apart the hypapophysis fig 32 hy beyond the anterior fourth part of the vertebral column is reduced to a straight ridge and is not produced posteriorly In the SeaSerpent Hydrus fig 33 the diapophysis also sends out a process above and below the articular tubercle but that which seems to underprop the zygapophysis does not extend so far out as in the Coluber The neural spine fig 33 ns is higher in proportion to its anteroposterior extent a very small hyp apophysis projects below the articular ball of the centrum and a low ridge is con tinued froni it along the under part of the centrum In the Naja or Cobra di Capello the neural fig 34 ns spine is lower but the hypapophysis hy is longer than in either of the preceding genera The diapophysis presents a welmarked articular tubercle fig 35 d upon its upper part and both the upper dand lower d processes are wellmarked although the former is shorter than in the gnus Coluber The RattletSnake Crotalus fig 3639 is remarliable for the development of the hypapophjsis h to an equal length with the neural spine ns trhroughout the

they could be inteigibly described without determinations and names What is truly to be deprecated is the unnecessary chang of names when once rightly applied MDCCCLI 5 D 749PROFESSOR OWEN ON THE

end of the zygapophysis z fig 37 I refiain fiom giving names to these upper and lower processes because they really are nothing more than mnere subdivisions of the diapophyses and characterize the vertebrae of a few genera of a single order of Reptiles In the Boas and Pythons fig 2427 the divisions d and d of the diapophysis are wholly wanting that process is entirely occupied by the articular surface for the rib which is vertically oblong convex in the axis of the centrum and convex verti cally at its upper half but concave vertically at its lower half The base of the neural arch swells outward froni its confluence with the centrum and developes from each angle a zygapophysis which is much longer transversely than in any of the preceding genera of Serpents fig 27 z z The zygosphene fig 25 z s is nar rower in proportion to its height and the zygantrum fig 26 z a is correspondingly deeper and more circumscribed In an African Constrictor Python regius which measured 15 feet 6 inches in length and had 348 vertebrae the firt seventy had long hypapophyses which afterwards subsided into the obtuse ridge ard tubercle shown at fig 27 hy Of the value of the minute and apparently insignificant modifications of the verte bral processes above described some idea may be formed by their application to determnine the nature and affinities of the great Serpent of which tbe vertebrae have been found fossil in the eocene tertiary deposits of Kent and Sussex The veritable Ophidian nature of the fossils in question is demonstrated not only by the super added zygosphenal z s fig 45 and zygantral z a fig 46 articulations but by the solidity of the zygosphene by the size and form of the centrum by those of its articular cup c fig 45 and ball c fig 46 and of its hypapophysis y and also by the size and prominence of the diapophysis d The largest vertere probably from about the middle of the body as compared with the vertebrae fiorn the same part of tie skeleton of a Python Sebce

forwards as far as but not beyond the apex of the anterior zygapophysis z forming the angle between the lateral and anterior surfaces whilst the horizontal articular facet forms the third surface of that threesided conical process In the Python the nonarticular part of the same zygapophysis is convex and the process is much more extended outwardly the proportions of the zygapophysis in the Palceophis more resemble those in the Coluber and Hydrus bult differ from these as also fiom Naja and Crotalus in the nonextension of the diapophysial point beyond the articular surface A ridge or horizontal rising of the bone extends from the anterior to the posterior zygapophysis but is more or less blunted or subsides midway and is by no means so produced outwards as in Python in this respect more resembling that in Coluber and Hydrus Below the middle of this ridge on a level with the upper surface of the centrum there is a short nearly parallel rising in Palceophis fig 44 Thle zygosphene fig 45 z s is slightly excavated anteriorly and shows no trace of the tubercle which characterizes the middle of that surface in the Python fig 25 it is also broader in proportion to its height But perhaps the most characteristic feature of the vertebre of the Palceophis is the peculiar production of the posterior border of the neurapophysis into an angle n fig 44 directed upwards outwards and backwards there is no trace of this process in the Hydrus fig 33 or the other existing genera f Serpents The posterior zygapophysis resembles of course the anterior one in its much less extent especially transversely as compared with that in the Python and the posterior border of the neurapophysis fig 44 z n rises from its apex vertically or a little inclined outwards and backwards giving a squarish form to the slurface of the neural arch in which the zygantra z a fig 46 are ex cavated these cavities in proportion to the articular ball beneath are smaller and less deep that in

constant location of the inferior exogenous pro cesses from the centrum is in the caudal region where they are frequeitly associated with a haemal arch and spine In the Cape Hare or Jerboa Helamys

purposes of correct and definite de scription being sufficiently answered by distinguishing under the name  hypapo physis those commonly exogenous inferior processes of the centrum whether single or in pairs from the autogenous haemal arches and spines with which they have usually been confounded In the anterior tioracic and the cervical region of Crocodiles and Lizards the hypapophysis is

pair of hypapophyses in the Iguana and Mosaszurust as likewise in Ruminants This bifid modification is more commonly found ii the caudal vertebrae of Reptiles as it is in Mammals but in the Iguanodon some of the caudal vertebrae have the hypapophysis single where eg it supports the coalesced bases of the haemapophyses of such vertebrae In the Sawtoothed Seal Leptonyx serridens the cervical and anterior dorsal vertebrae have a hypapophysial ridge which in the latter is produced into a tubero sity the lutmbar vertebrae are characterized by a pair of hypapophyses from near the hinder end of the centrurm In the Phocz grtenlandica the strong hypapophysial ridge of the lumbar vertebrae also divides into two tuberous processes These processes indicate the great develop ment of the arterior vertebral muscles eg the  longi colli and psoae and relate to the importmnt share which the vertebrae and muscles of the trunk take in the locomotion of the Sealtribe especially when on dry land where

developed from the two succeeding cervicals beyond which the hypapophysis gra dually subsides to the seventh cervical In the Camel Camelus bactrianus the atlas has no hypapophysis but this com mences as a ridge from the hinder half of the centrum of the dentata expands as it proceeds backwards and divides into two tubercles In the third and fourth cervicals it is principally represented by the pair of posterior tubercles vhich subside in the fifth cervical vertebra The dentata of the Giraffe has a strong hypapophysial ridge from near the fore part of its body In the Monottemes the atlas is remarkable for a modification cf the hypapophysis similar to that which it undergoes in the caudal vertebrae of rost Mammrals it forms eg a pair of processes which diverge fiorn one another in the

plate simply expanded at its end and growing somewhat shorter to the last fig 51 ID  hy In the Sphamiscus minor the first dorsal vertebra or the fourteenth vertebra from the head presents three hypapophyses which appear to be blended together in the next vertebra so as to form the common base of a pair of diverging plates The hypapophyses in the Penguins have an analogous function to that in the Seals extending thesurface of attachment of the powerful muscles on the ventral aspect of the vertebrl column which so materially aid in the shuffling gasteropodal move ments of bothkinds of

MEGATHERIUM as the homologue of that arch The perforated haemal arch in the cervical vertebrae of the Pelican and the parallel descending processes similarly protecting the caudal artery in the Python Plate LI fig 28 are alike exogenous growths from the cen trum and are serially homologous with the hypapophysis not with the haemapophysis The total absence of true ossified hremapophyses throughout the trunk and tail vertebrae is a striking characteristic of the Ophidian reptiles as it is of fishes The determination of the homology of the autogenous haemal arches in the tail carries with it that of the question of their relation to the inferior and sometimes perforated exogenous processes of the centrum in more advanced parts of the verte bral column The vast difference in point of size between the socalled  chevronbone of the Crocodile and the bony arch formed by the sternal and vertebral ribs of a thoracic vertebra seems at first sight to discountenance the idea of any homology between them But the difference is not greater than that between the neural arch of the parietal segment of the skull in Man and the arch formed above the middle dorsal vertebra yet I think it may be now assumed as a settled point in anatomy that those arches are homotypes or serial homologues The difference in point of size is indeed much less in the coldblooded and smallbrained Vertebrates than in Man but the transition from the abdomninal to the caudal haemal arches in fishes is much more gradual than that of the cranial to the abdominal neural arches in the same class whilst the similarity of the neural and haemal arches to one another is so close throughout the region of the tail as to impress the mind with a conviction that they are alike the result of modified annular elements in short vertical homotypes CUVIER accordingly designates them by the same descriptive phrasest The general proposition that the chevron bones or inferior annular part and spine of the vertebrae in the tail of fishes are modifications of the haemal arches in the trunk may be deemed to be unassailable But the haemal arch is a complex whole and may include diapophyses or parapophyses with pleurapophyses haemapo physes and haemal spine In the abdomen of fishes the bony arch is incomplete below and in its most complex state consists only of parapophyses and pleurapo physes With the exception of the clavicular and pubic arches bony haemapophyses are developed in no part of the trunk of fishes When therefore we rigidly scru tinize the composition of the haemal arches in the tail we find them composed of parts quite distinct from true haemapophyses and also composed of different vertebral elements in different species of fishes a fact which adds to the proof of the essential serial homology of those arches in the tail with the haemal arches in the trunk In many osseous fishes the haemal arches in the tail are formed by the gradual bending down and coalescence of the parapophyses in some the union  Cartilaginous appendages to the pleurapophyses in Serpents may be viewed as rudimental haemapophyses t Les caudales ont une partie annulaire et une apophyse epineuse en

Polypterus and LepidosteusY and in the nearly allied Protopterus and Lepidosiren the true pleurapophyses gradually bend down and unite to forn the haemal arches in the tail whilst in the Amia calva the pleurapophyses coalesce to form the inferior spine continued from the haemal arch formed by the coalesced parapophyses In the Codtribe Gadidce the progressively reduced pleurapophyses coalesce with the parapophyses to form the haemal arches In Ophidians as in Fishes the transition from the trunk to the tail is not interrupted by the modification of any of the vertebral segments to form a pelvis The ribs are supported by diapophyses with which they become confluent in the tail where some of thEe pleurapophyses are singularly modified bifurcate or thickened at the extremity but never bent down and united together to form the haemal arch as there aie no bony haemapophyses completing the haemal arch in the trun the trunksuc ceeding segments of the tail retain or have been influenced by the same modifica tion of vertebral development and the analogue of the haemal arch is formed as I have before observed by a pailr of parallel exogenous hypapophyses Plate LII fig 28 hy and is open below like the incomplete haemal arches throughout the trunk In Lizards and Crocodiles a new vertebral element appears to be introduced to com plete the haemal arch in the chest it is however only a repetition of an element which under a more developed and modified form completes the haemal arches in the head in both fishes and reptiles viz the haemapophysis this element is called upper and  lower jaw and  horn of the hyoid in the head sternal rib or  cartilage of the rib in the chest the same element is retained to form the pelvis where it is called  pubis and  ischium and it is

pair of hameapophyses become confluent at their distal ends and form the socalled chevron bones in the Crocodile and most other Saurians Under all these modifications the haemapophyses coexist with pleurapophyses in the thorax the pelvis and the tail only in the latter region the pleurapophyses become anchylosed to the diapophyses or to the centrum and stand out as transverse processes fig 60 d pl The sudden diminution in the size of the haemal arch in the tail as contrasted with its expanse in the pelvis is apt at first to excite some doubt as to the serial homology of the  chevron bones

latter fig 66 combines two re markable modifications which are separately presented by the occipital vertebra of the skull in the Frog and in Man In the Frog as in all other batrachians the occipital vertebra articulates with the succeeding vertebra called atlas by a transverse pair of convex condyles similar to those shown at c c figs 65 and 66 in the Human subject as in all manmmalia the centrum of the occipital vertebra processus basilaris ossis occipitis is flattened and united to that of the atlas processus odontoides by a liga ment the back part of the centrum of the eighth cervical in the Trionyx fig 66 c is in like manner reduced to a depressed plate and is joined by a ligament to the succeeding centrurn viz that of the first dorsal vertebra The last cervical vertebra of the Trionyx resembles the first cervical in Man by having no neural spine it is further remarkable for the peculiar development and form of its anterior z and posterior z zygapophyses Fig 64 shows the two concavities at the back part of the centrum of the seventh cervical vertebra which receive the two con vexities at the forepart of the eighth 764 I 1Phil Traw Mi C C  11 PIl LUi  764 f 6 X 1T h4 1 d

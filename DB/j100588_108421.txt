1850READ JANUARY 9 1851 BEFORE ENTERING UPON THE DESCRIPTION OF THE SKELETON OF THE MEGATHERIUM IT IS REQUISITE TO PREMISE SOME REMARKS ON THE VERTEBRAE OF THE MAMMALIA IN GENERAL HITHERTO THESE PARTS HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED BY MEANS OF THE TERMS SUPPLIED BY HUMAN ANATOMY BUT THE SKELETON OF MAN IS ONE WHICH DEVIATES MOST FROM THE COMMON ARCHETYPE SOME PARTS ARE DEVELOPED IN EXCESS OTHER PARTS WHICH ARE PRESENT AS A GENERAL RULE IN THE MAMMALIAN SERIES ARE EITHER RUDIMENTAL OR ABSENT THE LATTER IS MORE PARTICULARLY THE CASE WITH THOSE PROCESSES OF THE VERTEBRAE WHICH ARE DEVELOPED IN RELATION TO THE ATTACHMENT AND FORCE OF THE MUSCLES AND WHICH BEING CONNECTED WITH PARTICULAR MODES AND MEDIA OF MOTION BECOME EMINENTLY SIGNIFICATIVE OF THE HABITS AND AFFINITIES OF THE SPECIES THE CONSIDERATION AND COMPARISON OF THESE PROCESSES THEREFORE MOST OF WHICH HAVE RECEIVED NO NAMES IN HUMAN ANATOMY ARE ESSENTIAL TO A RIGHT DETERMINATION OF THE HABITS AND AFFINITIES OF THE MEGATHERIUM AND IN ORDER TO MAKE INTELLIGIBLE THE TERMS IN WHICH THE VERTEBRAL PECULIARITIES OF THAT GREAT EXTINCT ANIMAL WILL BE DESCRIBED I PROPOSE FIRST TO ILLUSTRATE THEM BY GIVING A COMPARATIVE SURVEY OF THE PRINCIPAL MODIFICATIONS OF THE EXOGENOUS PROCESSES IN THE VERTEBRATE SERIES THE EXOGENOUS PROCESSES OF A VERTEBRA ARE THOSE WHICH GROW OUT OF THE PRE VIOUSLY OSSIFIED PARTS AND ARE SO CLASSIFIED AND NAMED IN CONTRADISTINCTION FROM THE AUTOGENOUS PARTS OR ELEMENTS OF A VERTEBRA WHICH ARE DEVELOPED FROM THEIR OWN PROPER CENTRES OF OSSIFICATION IN THE SIXTH CERVICAL VERTEBRA FOR EXAMPLE OF THE HUMAN FOETUS THE PART WHICH SOEMMERRING THE MOST EXACT AND CLASSICAL AUTLHOR ON ANTHROPOTOMY CALLS IRADIX PRIOR SEU ANTICA PROCESSUS TRANSVERSI VERTEBRAET IS DEVELOPED FIOM A SEPARATE CENTRE AND FOR SOME TIME CONTINUES TO BE A DISTINCT BAR OF BONE WHILST THE PART CALLED  RADIX POSTICA PROCESSUS TRANSVERSI VERTEBRAE GROWS OUT OF THE BASE OF THE  RADIX ARCUS POSTERIORIS  AS SOEMMERRING DENOMINATES THE AUTOGENOUS PART WHICH I HAVE CALLED NEURAPOPHYSIS AND FROM THIS ELEMENT OR FROM THE ARCH FORMED BY ITS COALESENCE WITH ITS FELLOW WHEN IT CONSTITUTES THE ARCUS POSTERIOR VERTEBRAE OF SOEMMERRING OTHER PROCESSES GROW OUT AS FOR EXAMPLE THE PROCESSUS OBLIQUI SEU  ON THE PLESIOSAURUS MACROCEPHALUS GEOLOGICAL TRANSACTIONS VOL V 2ND SERIES P 518 1838 T DE CORPORIS HUMANI FABRICA 8VO 1794 TOM I PP 239 241  IB  LB P 236 4 Z 2PROFESSOR OWEN ON THE MEGATHERIUM ARTICULARES SUPERIORES ET INFERIORES THESE DIFFERENT PROCESSES OFFER MANY MODIFICA TIONS OF SIZE AND SHAPE AND A CERTAIN CHANGE OF POSITION AND DIRECTION WHEN TRACED THROUGH THE VERTEBRATE SERIES IN THE COURSE OF WHICH COMPARISON THE ANATOMIST MEETS WITH OTHER EXOGENOUS PROCESSES TRACEABLE WITH EQUAL CERTAINTY FROM SPECIES TO SPECIES AND DETERMINABLE UNDER ALL THEIR VARIOUS MODIFICATIONS WHENCE IT BECOMES NECESSARY FOR THE PURPOSE OF BRIEF AND CLEAR DESCRIPTION TO INDICATE EACH OF SUCH PROCESSES BY A SINGLE DEFINITE NAME CAPABLE OF BEING FORMED INTO AN ADJECTIVE TO EXPRESS THE PRO PERTIES OR APPENDAGES OF SUCH PROCESSES THE CONVENIENCE OF SUCH TERMS WILL BE ADMITTED BY THE HUMAN ANATOMIST WHO CONSIDERS THAT THE PROCESSES IN QUESTION HAVE AS YET RECEIVED NO DISTINCT SUBSTANTIVE NAMES IN ANTHROPOTOMY AND WHO KNOWS FROM OSTEOGENY HOW VAGUELY SOME OF THE DESCRIPTIVE TERMS AS TRANSVERSE PROCESS FOR EXAMPLE ARE APPLIED TO PARTS OBVIOUSLY VERY DIFFERENT IN THEIR NATURE AND CONSTITUTION THE TRANSVERSE PROCESS OF A DORSAL VERTEBRA IS A SIMPLE EXOGENOUS GROWTH FROM THE NEURAPOPHYSIS COMMONLY AFFORDING AN ARTICULAR SURFACE FOR A RIB THE  TRANSVERSE PROCESS OF A SACRAL VERTEBRAF IS AN AUTOGENOUS PART WHICH CONTINUES DISTINCT LONG AFTER BIRTH THE TRANSVERSE PROCESS OF A CERVICAL VERTEBRA IS PARTLY EXOGENOUS PARTLY AUTOGENOUS CONSISTING IN FACT OF TWO DISTINCT PROCESSES AND A RUDIMENTAL RIB BUT DISTINGUISHED IN ANTHROPOTOMY FROM OTHER TRANSVERSE PROCESSES ONLY BY BEING PERFORATED BUT IF SUCH COMMON PHRASE OF  TRANSVERSE PROCESS WITH A NOTE OF DISTINCTION AS THAT IT IS PERFORATED IN THE CERVICAL VERTEBRAE BE SUFFICIENT FOR THE EXIGENCIES AND APPLICATIONS OF HUMAN ANATOMY IT BECOMES QUITE INADEQUATE AND OFTEN TOTALLY INAP PLICABLE TO THE ANSWERABLE PARTS IN THE LOWER ANIMALS IN THE CROCODILE FOR EXAMPLE THE CERVICAL RIB IS MUCH MORE DEVELOPED AND MAINTAINS CONSTANTLY A FREE ARTICULATION BY A HEAD WITH A WELLDEVELOPED INFERIOR TRANSVERSE PROCESS  RADIX ANTICA SOEMM AND BY A TUBERCLE WITH AN EQUALLY DISTINCT SUPERIOR TRANSVERSE PROCESS  RADIX POS TICA SOEMM IN THE WOMBAT PLATE XLIV FIG 12 THE

FOSSIL REMAINS CONSISTED OF VERTEBRAE OR PARTS OF VERTEBRAE AND THAT A DEFINITE IDEA OF THESE COMPLEX BONES WITH A SUBSTANTIVE NOMENCLATURE FOR THEIR PARTS WAS INDISPENSABLE IN ORDER TO GIVE A CLEAR AND INTELLIGIBLE DESCRIPTION OF THEM IN A MEMOIR ON THE PLESIOSAURUS MACROCEPHALUS READ BEFORE THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY APRIL 1838 I THEREFORE DEFINED THE PARTS OF THE TYPICAL VERTEBRA DISTINGUISHED THE AUTOGENOUS ELEMENTS FROM THE EXOGENOUS PARTS AND PROPOSED THE NOMENCLATURE WHICH I HAVE SINCE USED AND FURTHER ILLUSTRATED IN SUBSEQUENT WORKS REFERRING MORE PARTICULARLY TO MY  LECTURES ON THE COMPARATIVE ANATOMY OF THE VERTEBRATE ANIMALS AND MY WORK ON THE ARCHETYPE OF THE VERTEBRATE SKELETONT FOR THE FULLER EXPOSITION OF THE VIEWS ENTERTAINED BY ANATOMISTS ON THE NATURE OF THE VERTEBRA IT IS SUFFICIENT FOR THE PRESENT PURPOSE TO REMARK THAT THE TERM PARAPOPHYSIS WAS PROPOSED FOR THE INFERIOR TRANSVERSE PROCESS OR  ANTERIOR ROOT OF THE PERFORATED TRANSVERSE PROCESS OF THE CER VICAL VERTEBRAE THE TERM DIAPOPHYSIS FOR THE SUPERIOR TLANSVERSE PROCESS OR POSTERIOR ROOT OF THE PERFORATED TRANSVERSE PROCESS AND THE TETRM  PLEURAPOPHYSIS FOR THAT ELEMENT WHICH ESSENTIALLY THE SAME IN DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE SPINE IS SHORT STYLIFORM AND SPEEDILY ANCHYLOSED IN THE NECK OF MAN IS REMARKABLE FOR ITS LENGTH AND FREEDOM OF MOTION IN THE BACK AND IS AS REMARKABLE FOR ITS BREADTH THICKNESS AND WEDGED FIXEDNESS IN THE SACRUNM WHICH IS HATCHETSHAPED AND FREE IN THE NECK OF THE CROCODILE AND PLESIOSAURUS AND IS AS BROAD AND FLAT IN THE FIRST DORSAL SEG MENT OF A WHALE AS THE ORDINARY MAMMALIAN SCAPULA OR ANY OF THE FLAT BONES IN ANTHROPOTOMY THE NECESSITY FOR A DEFINITE TECHNICAL TERM FOR THIS VERTEBRAL ELEMENT WAS THE GREATER BECAUSE THE NAME COSTA OR RIB HAS NOT ONLY BEEN WITHHELD IN HUMAN ANATOMY FROM THE ELEMENT IN QUESTION UNDER EVERY MODIFICATION SAVE THAT IN WHICH IT RETAINS ITS INDIVIDUALITY AND MOBILITY WITH A CERTAIN LENGTH AND SLENDERNESS BUT IT HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO ANOTHER AND QUITE DISTINCT ELEMENT VIZ THE HAEMAPOPHYSIS WHICH FROM BEING COMMONLY CARTILAGINOUS IN THE THORAX OF MAN HAS OBTAINED THE NAMNE OF CARTILAGE OF THE RIB OR PARS CARTILAGINEA COSTEE AS THIS PART HOWEVER IS MOST COMMONLY A DISTINCT OSSIFIED PART IN THE AIRBREATHING VERTEBRATA IT HAS BEEN CALLED IN COMPARATIVE ANATOMY THE STERNAL RIB IN CONTRADISTINCTION TO THE VERTEBRAL RIB

PRESENT IN OTHER REGIONS BESIDES THE STERNAL OR THORACIC ONE THE SUBJECT HOWEVER OF THE PRESENT COMMUNICATION BEING THE EXOGENOUS PARTS OF THE VERTEBRAE I SHALL RETURN TO IT BY REMARKING THAT IN HUMAN ANATOMY OTHER PROCESSES HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED BESIDES THE SPINE THE ZYGAPOPHYSIS OBLIQUE OR ARTICULAR PROCESS THE DIAPOPHYSIS TRANSVERSE PROCESS AND RADIX POSTICA IN THE NECK AND THE  PARAPOPHYSIS PART

AUROCHS IN WHICH AS IN MOST OTHER RUMINANTS THE ANAPOPHYSIS IS NOT PRESENT  THE PROCESS WHICH IS DEVELOPED SOMETIMES SINGLY SOMETIMES IN PAIRS FROM THE UNDER PART OF THE CENTRUIN IN SOME MAMMALS AND IN MOST BIRDS AND REPTILES I HAVE CALLED HYPAPOPHYSISF I PROPOSE IN THE FIRST PLACE TO TRACE THE HOMOLOGIES AND TO INDICATE THE CHIEF MODI FICATIONS OF THE METAPOPHYSES AND ANAPOPHYSES IN THE MAMMALIAN CLASS AND THEREBY TO VINDICATE THEIR TITLE TO DISTINCT NAMES AND DEMONSTRATE THE UTILITY IF NOT THE NECESSITY OF SUCH SIGNS FOR PARTS SO CONSTANT IN EXISTENCE AND SO VARIABLE IN CHARACTER IN A GREAT PROPORTION OF THAT CLASS I MAY REMARK ALSO THAT AS I SHALL FIEQUENTLY HAVE TO ALLUDE TO THE ANTERIOR AS DISTINCT FTOM THE POSTERIOR ZYGAPOPHYSES I SHALL CALL THE FORMER  PROZYGAPOPHYSIS AND USE THE TERM ZYGAPOPHYSIS SIMPLY TO SIGNIFY THE POSTERIOR PAIR   WITH REGARD TO THE VERTEBRAE OF THE TRUNK OF THE AUROCHS I MAY REMARK THAT THE ONLY ACCESSORY PRO CESS IN ADDITION TO THE ORDINARY ZYGAPOPHYSES AND DIAPOPHYSES IS THE  METAPOPHYSIS WHICH APPEARS AS A STOUT TUBERCLE ABOVE THE DIAPOPHYSIS IN THE MIDDLE DORSALS AND GRADUALLY ADVANCES AND RISES UPON THE ANTERIOR ZYG APOPHYSES IN THE POSTERIOR DORSAL AND LUMBAR VERTEBRAE THIS PROCESS IS DEVELOPED TO AN EQUALITY OF LENGTH WITH THE SPINOUS PROCESSES IN THE ARMADILLOS IT IS COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH ANOTHER ACCESSORY EXOGENOUS PROCESS TO WHICH I HAVE GIVEN THE NAME  ANAPOPHYSIS IN THE CATALOGUE OF THE OSTEOLOGICAL SERIES IN THE ROYAL COL LEGE OF SURGEONS THIS PROCESS WHICH IN MOST OF THE RODENTIA RISES AT FIRST IN COMMON WITH THE METAPO PHYSIS AS A TUBERCLE ABOVE THE DIAPOPHYSIS SEPARATES FROM THE METAPOPHYSIS AS THE VERTEBRWE APPROACH THE PELVIS AND IN THE LUMBAR SERIES THE ANAPOPHYSIS IS SEEN PROJECTING BACKWARDS FROM THE BASE OR A LITTLE ABOVE THE BASE OF THE DIAPOPHYSIS ITS OFFICE BEING USUALLY THAT OF UNDERLAPPING THE ANTERIOR ZYGAPOPHYSIS OF THE SUC CEEDING VERTEBRW AND STRENGTHENLING THE ARTICULATION WHENCE CUVIER HAS ALLUDED TO IT AS AN ACCESSORY ARTICULAR PROCESS BUT ITS RELATION TO THE ZYGAPOPHYSIAL JOINT IS AN OCCASIONAL AND NOT A CONSTANT CHARACTER THE TENTH DORSAL VERTEBRA OF THE SAWTOOTHED SEAL LEPTONYX

REPRESENTED BY THE SAME ELEMENTS COALESCED THAT CONSTITUTE THE SOCALLED DORSAL VERTEBRA THEY ARE CALLED LUMBAR VERTEBRAE THEY HAVE NO OSSIFIED PLEURAPOPHYSES WITH THE FOLLOWING COMMENT PROFESSOR OWENS PLEURAPOPHYSIS IS THE RIB OR COSTAL APPENDAGE OF HIS TYPICAL VERTEBRA WHILE HE STATES THEREFORE THAT THE LUMBAR VERTEBRA HAS NO PLEURAPOPHYSIS HE MEANS THAT IT HAS NO RIB OR COSTAL PIECE THIS OVERSIGHT WHICH WITH ALL RESPECT I BELIEVE IT TO BE HAS ARISEN FROM THE EVIDENT ERROR OF MISTAKING THE LUMBAR TRANSVERSE PROCESS AS BEING THE COUNTERPART OR HOMOLOGUE OF THE DORSAL TRANSVERSE PROCESS WHICH IF SUCH WERE THE CASE WOULD LEAVE THE LUMBAR VERTEBRA WITHOUT A RIB THE PASSAGE SO COMMENTED ON IS TAKEN FROM A  SECTION OF MY WORK TREATING OF THE SPECIALITIES OF THE HUMAN SKELETON IN THE  SECTION TREATING ON LUMBAR VERTEHRE IN GENERAL I STATE THE LUMBAR VERTEBRE WHICH IN SOME MAMMALS SHOW IN THE FXETAL STATE DISTINCT RUDIMENTS OF PLEURAPOPHYSES MORE MINUTE THAN THOSE IN THE NECK HAVE THEM SOON ANCHYLOSED TO THE EXTREMITIES OF THE DIAPOPHYSES WHICH ARE THUS ELONGATED P 94 NO ONE PROPOSING FAIRLY TO CRITICISE MY OPINIONS ON THE TRANSVERSE PROCESS OF A LUMBAR VERTEBRA IN GENERAL OUGHT TO HAVE REPRE SENTED THEM BY A QUOTATION OF A DESCRIPTION OF THE LUMBAR VERTEBRA OF A PARTICULAR SPECIES BUT TAKING THE PASSAGE UPON THE HUMAN SKELETON AS CITED ABOVE THE CONCLUSION OF THE CRITIC THAT I  LEAVE THE LUMBAR VERTEBRA WITHOUT A RIB CAN ONLY BE SUSTAINED BY THE OMISSION OF A WORD IN THAT PASSAGE WHAT I DO STATE IS THAT IN THEM  THEY HAVE NO OSSIFIED PLEURAPOPHYSES NOW IN A PREVIOUS PART OF THE WORK QUOTED FROM IT IS SHOWN THAT A VERTEBRAL ELEMENT MAY EXIST IN THREE STATES  FIBROUS  CARTILAGINOUS  OSSEOUS AND THAT ITS ABSENCE WAS NOT TO BE ASSUMED MERELY BECAUSE IT HAD NOT PASSED INTO THE BONY STAGE I HAVE NEVER MET WITH A HUMAN LUMBAR VERTEBRA SHOWING THE TRANSVERSE PROCESS LENGTHENED OUT BY A DISTINCT AUTOGENOUS OSSIFICATION MERITING LIKE THAT OF THE WOMBAT PLATE

THE TRUNK AND TAIL VERTEBRAE IS A STRIKING CHARACTERISTIC OF THE OPHIDIAN REPTILES AS IT IS OF FISHES THE DETERMINATION OF THE HOMOLOGY OF THE AUTOGENOUS HAEMAL ARCHES IN THE TAIL CARRIES WITH IT THAT OF THE QUESTION OF THEIR RELATION TO THE INFERIOR AND SOMETIMES PERFORATED EXOGENOUS PROCESSES OF THE CENTRUM IN MORE ADVANCED PARTS OF THE VERTE BRAL COLUMN THE VAST DIFFERENCE IN POINT OF SIZE BETWEEN THE SOCALLED  CHEVRONBONE OF THE CROCODILE AND THE BONY ARCH FORMED BY THE STERNAL AND VERTEBRAL RIBS OF A THORACIC VERTEBRA SEEMS AT FIRST SIGHT TO DISCOUNTENANCE THE IDEA OF ANY HOMOLOGY BETWEEN THEM BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS NOT GREATER THAN THAT BETWEEN THE NEURAL ARCH OF THE PARIETAL SEGMENT OF THE SKULL IN MAN AND THE ARCH FORMED ABOVE THE MIDDLE DORSAL VERTEBRA YET I THINK IT MAY BE NOW ASSUMED AS A SETTLED POINT IN ANATOMY THAT THOSE ARCHES ARE HOMOTYPES OR SERIAL HOMOLOGUES THE DIFFERENCE IN POINT OF SIZE IS INDEED MUCH LESS IN THE COLDBLOODED AND SMALLBRAINED VERTEBRATES THAN IN MAN BUT THE TRANSITION FROM THE ABDOMNINAL TO THE CAUDAL HAEMAL ARCHES IN FISHES IS MUCH MORE GRADUAL THAN THAT OF THE CRANIAL TO THE ABDOMINAL NEURAL ARCHES IN THE SAME CLASS WHILST THE SIMILARITY

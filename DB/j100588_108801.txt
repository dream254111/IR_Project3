J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,108801,ON THE INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE ON THE ELECTRIC CONDUCTINGPOWER OF THALLIUM AND IRON,I207018, 369  XVI ON THE INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE ON THE ELECTRIC CONDUCTINGPOWER OF THALLIUM AND IRON BY A MATTHIESSEN FBS LECTURER ON CHEMISTRY IN ST MARYS HOSPITAL AND C VOGT PHD RECEIVED FEBRUARY 12READ MARCH 12 1863 IT HAS BEEN SHOWN  THAT THE CONDUCTINGPOWER OF SEVERAL OF THE PURE METALS DECREASED BETWEEN 0 AND 100 TO THE SAME EXTENT NAMELY 29307 PER CENT ON CONTINUING THE RESEARCH WITH OTHER METALS AND ALLOYS WE HAVE FOUND THAT THALLIUM AND IRON FORM AN EXCEPTION TO THE ABOVE AND IN THE FOLLOWING WE WILL DESCRIBE THE EXPERIMENTS MADE WITH THESE METALS THE THALLIUM WAS KINDLY LENT TO US BY MR CROOKES THE DISCOVERER OF THIS NEW METAL WHO WITH GREAT READINESS PLACED A SMALL QUANTITY OF IT AT OUR DISPOSAL ON ACCOUNT OF ITS EXTREME SOFTNESS FOR IT IS MUCH SOFTER THAN PURE LEAD IT WAS EASILY CUT WITH A KNIFE TO FIT ONE OF THE SMALL PRESSES DESCRIBED IN THE  PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE FEBRUARY 1857 AND PRESSED WITHOUT THE APPLICATION OF HEAT THE WIRE AS SOON AS IT CAME OUT OF THE SMALL HOLE OF THE PRESS PASSED INTO A TUBE FILLED WITH WATER FOR ALTHOUGH THE METAL READILY OXIDIZES IN AIR YET IT MAY BE KEPT UNDER WATER FREE FROM AIR FOR SOME TIME WITHOUT OXIDATION WHEN HOWEVER THE WIRE IS EXPOSED TO THE AIR FOR A SHORT TIME IT LOSES ITS LUSTRE AND IS SOON COVERED WITH A COATING OF OXIDE WHICH AS IN THE CASES OF LEAD AND ZINC PROTECTS IN A GREAT MEASURE THE METAL FROM FURTHER OXIDATION THE ERROR CAUSED BY THE SLIGHT OXIDATION DURING THE SHORT TIME WE WERE OBLIGED TO MANIPULATE WITH THE WIRE IN AIR MAY THEREFORE BE OVERLOOKED MORE ESPECIALLY AS WIRES OF THE SAME PIECE OF METAL SHOWED THE SAME CONDUCTINGPOWER WHEN PRESSED AT DIFFERENT TIMES NOW IF THE SLIGHT OXIDATION HAD ANY MARKED EFFECT WE OUGHT TO HAVE FOUND GREAT DIFFERENCES IN THE CONDUCTINGPOWER OF DIFFERENT WIRES FOR IT CAN SCARCELY BE SUPPOSED THAT IN ALL CASES THE SAME AMOUNT OF OXIDATION HAD TAKEN PLACE AGAIN ALTHOUGH THALLIUM APPEARS TO BE ATTACKED BY ALCOHOL YET WE FOUND WE MIGHT VARNISH THE WIRE WITH A SOLUTION OF SHELLLAC IN ALCOHOL FOR THE SMALL QUANTITY OF ALCOHOL CONTAINED IN THE FIRST COATING OF VARNISH VOLA TILIZES SO QUICKLY THAT IT HAS VERY LITTLE TIME TO ACT ON THE WIRE IN FACT THE RESISTANCE OF THE WIRE WAS FOUND TO BE THE SAME WHEN DETERMINED BEFORE BEING VARNISHED AND AFTER THREE OR FOUR COATINGS OF VARNISH HAD DRIED ON IT THE REASON OF VARNISHING THE WIRE WAS TO PROTECT THE METAL FROM THE ACTION OF THE HOT OIL THE

IT SEEMED TO US OF PECULIAR INTEREST TO SEE WHETHER IN ITS ELECTRIC BEHAVIOUR IT WOULD RESEMBLE THAT METAL NAMELY IF WHEN ALLOYED WITH TIN CADMIUM OR ZINC THE CONDUCTINGPOWER OF THE ALLOY WOULD BE EQUAL TO THE MEAN CONDUCTINGPOWER OF THE VOLUMES OF THE COMPONENT METALS WE ARE INDEBTED TO MR CROOKES FOR AN ALLOY OF THALLIUM AND TIN CONTAINING ONLY TRACES OF THE LATTER METAL AND ON TESTING ITS CONDUCTINGPOWER WE FOUND IT LOWER THAN THAT OF PURE THALLIUM SHOWING THAT THE ADDITION OF A BETTER CONDUCTOR THE CONDUCTINGPOWER OF TIN BEING AT 0 12366 CAUSES A DECREMENT IN THE CONDUCTINGPOWER OF THE METAL AGAIN WE ALLOYED A PORTION OF M LAMYS THALLIUM WITH TRACES OF CADMIUM AND HERE WE ALSO FOUND THE ABOVE OBSERVATION CONFIRMED THE CONDUCTINGPOWER OF CADMIUM BEING AT 0 23725 THALLIUM

OBVIOUS NAMELY THE HIGHER THE CONDUCTINGPOWER THE HIGHER THE PERCENTAGE DECREMENT IN THE CONDUCTING POWER BETWEEN 0 AND 100 IN FACT WE HAVE ALWAYS FOUND THIS TO BE THE CASE AND FROM EXPERIMENTS MADE WITH ABOUT 100 ALLOYS IN THIS DIRECTION WE HAVE NOT FOUND A SINGLE CASE WHERE THE PERCENTAGE DECREMENT IN THE CONDUCTINGPOWER BETWEEN 0 AND 100 IS GREATER THAN THAT OF THE PURE METALS FURTHER WE HAVE FOUND THAT WE MAY DEDUCE THE CONDUCTINGPOWER OF THE PURE METAL FROM THAT OF THE IMPURE ONE WHEN THE IMPURITY IN IT DOES NOT REDUCE IT MORE THAN SAY 10 TO 20 PER CENT FOR WE HAVE PROVED EXPERIMENTALLY THAT WITHIN THOSE LIMITS THE PERCENTAGE DECREMENT BETWEEN 00 AND 100 IN THE CONDUCTING POWER OF AN IMPURE METAL VARIES IN THE SAME RATIO AS THE CONDUCTINGPOWER OF THE IMPURE METAL AT 100 COMPARED WITH THAT OF THE PURE METAL AT 1000 THUS THE PER CENTAGE DECREMENT IN THE CONDUCTINGPOWER OF PURE IRON BETWEEN 0 AND 100 IS 38261 PER CENT THAT OF NO 5 36 07 PER CENT NOW IF THE ABOVE STATEMENT BE CORRECT BY 3 8261 MULTIPLYING THE CONDUCTINGPOWER OF NO 5 AT 100 BY 36070G WE SHALL OBTAIN THE CON DUCTINGPOWER OF THE PURE METAL AT 1000 AND THE CONDUCTINGPOWER AT 0 BY DIVIDING THAT NUMBER BY 061734 IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE WE GIVE THE RESULTS OF SUCH A CALCULATION WITH THOSE SPECIMENS OF IRON THE CONDUCTINGPOWERS OF WHICH DO NOT VARY MORE THAN 20 PER CENT FROM THAT DEDUCED FOR THE PURE METALON THE

CONDUCTINGPOWER OF ALLOYS ONE GLANCE HOWEVER WILL SHOW THAT THE DEDUCED VALUES AGREE AS WELL TOGETHER AS CAN BE EXPECTED CONSIDERING THAT THE RESULTS MAY BE MODIFIED BY THE PRESENCE OF CARBON SULPHUR C IN CASES WHERE WE MAY ASSUME THAT WE HAVE ONLY SOLUTIONS OF ONE METAL IN ANOTHER THE CONCORDANCE IN THE DEDUCED VALUES IS VERY GREAT IN FACT WHEN WE EXPERIMENT WITH METALS WHOSE CONDUCTINGPOWER IN A PURE STATE IS KNOWN AND WHEN THE IMPURITY IS ONLY DISSOLVED IN IT THEN THE DEDUCED CONDUCTINGPOWER AGREES ALMOST EXACTLY WITH THAT FOUND EXPERIMENTALLY FOR RESISTANCETHERMOMETERS AS DESCRIBED BY SIEMENS THE USE OF AN IRON WIRE WOULD GIVE MUCH GREATER DIFFERENCES FOR THE SAME INCREMENT OF TEMPERATURE THAN COPPER FOR THE RESISTANCE OF PURE COPPER WIRE INCREASES FOR EACH DEGREE ABOUT 04 PER CENT WHEREAS THAT OF PURE IRON INCREASES ABOUT 06 PER CENT FOR EACH DEGREE WHEN WE FOUND THAT IRON DECREASED IN CONDUCTINGPOWER BETWEEN 0 AND 100 MORE THAN THE PURE METALS AND HERE AGAIN WE WILL CALL ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT WE HAVE AS YET FOUND NO ALLOY TO DECREASE IN CONDUCTINGPOWER BETWEEN 0 AND 100 TO A GREATER EXTENT THAN THAT WHICH THE PURE METALS COMPOSING IT WOULD DO WE THOUGHT THAT ITS BEING A MAGNETIC BODY MIGHT POSSIBLY BE THE REASON OF IT BUT AFTER HAVING TESTED THALLIUM AND FOUND THAT THE CONDUCTINGPOWER OF THAT METAL ALSO DECREASES MORE THAN THAT OF THE PURE METALS WE KNEW THAT THIS COULD NOT WELL BE THE CASE FOR THALLIUM IS STRONGLY DIAMAGNETICT HEARING HOWEVER THAT PROFESSOR WOHLER POSSESSED SPECIMENS OF PURE COBALT AND NICKEL WIRE PREPARED BY M DEVILLE WE WROTE AND ASKED

PER CENT FROM OUR EXPERIMENTS WITH ALLOYS WE SHOULD DEDUCE THAT THE COBALT AND NICKEL WIRESON TIIE ELECTRIC CONDUCTINGPOWER OF THALLIUM AND IRON WERE NOT PURE AND WE ARE JUSTIFIED IN MAKING THIS STATEMENT BY THE FACT THAT WE HAVE NOT YET FOUND ANY METAL IN A PURE AND SOLID STATE TO DECREASE IN CONDUCTINGPOWER BETWEEN 0 AND 100 LESS THAN 29307 PER CENT AND FURTHER WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT ALTHOUGH THESE METALS MAY HAVE BEEN PURE WHEN IN THE STATE OF POWDER YET VERY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THEIR BEHAVIOUR TO THE CRUCIBLES AT THE HIGH TEMPERATURES AT WHICH THEY FUSE IT IS WELL KNOWN HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO PROCURE CHEMICALLY PURE IRON IN A FUSED STATE ON ACCOUNT OF ITS DECOMPOSING THE CRUCIBLES IN WHICH IT IS MELTED AND TAKING UP SOME IM PURITIES ASSUMING THEREFORE THAT COBALT AND NICKEL BEHAVE LIKE MOST OTHER PURE METALS NAMELY DECREASE IN CONDUCTINGPOWER BETWEEN 0 AND 100 29307 PER CENT WE MAY DEDUCE FROM THE ABOVE DATA THE CONDUCTINGPOWER OF THE PURE METALS THE CONDUCTINGPOWER OF PURE COBALT WOULD THEN BE 17223 AT 0 AND THAT OF PURE NICKEL 13106 AT 0 WE HOPE SHORTLY TO BE ABLE TO PREPARE SOME PURE COBALT AND NICKEL BY DEPOSITING GALVANOPLASTICALLY THOSE METALS IN THE FORM OF FOIL FROM SOLUTIONS OF THEIR PURE SALTS AND SO TO CHECK THE ABOVE DEDUCED VALUES FOR THE CONDUCTINGPOWER OF THE PURE METALS IN CONCLUSION WE GIVE IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE THE

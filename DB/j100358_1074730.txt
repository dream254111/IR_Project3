J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1074730,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE DIAGRAM,I244497,COMMUNICATIONS THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE DIAGRAM THE GIST OF PROFESSOR BARBOURS CONTRIBUTION IN THE APRIL NUMBER OF THE SCHOOL REVIEW TO THE DISCUSSION OF THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE DIA GRAM SEEMS TO BE THE TIMEHONORED OBJECTION OF THE PEDAGOGUE TO EVERY INNOVATION IN EDUCATIONIT CANNOT BE ADJUSTED TO FIT OUR METHODS DOUBTLESS IT IS TRUE THAT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL GENESIS OF THE SENTENCE WILL NOT AVAIL TO TEACH THE SUBJECT OF GRAMMAR AS THAT SUBJECT IS TODAY COMMONLY UNDERSTOODTHAT IS ACCOUNTING IT TO BE THE SCIENCE OF CRYSTALLIZED OR FOSSILIZED THOUGHTSTRUCTURE THE ANATOMY NOT THE PHYSIOLOGY OF SENTENTIAL EXPRESSION IF THAT IS THE GRAMMAR WE WANT TO TEACH NOW AS WE HAVE DONE IN THE PAST LET BE THE STRAIGHTLINE REED AND KELLOGG DIAGRAM WILL ADEQUATELY SERVE US BUT THOSE WHO STILL INSIST UPON THIS DIAGRAM AND THUS UPON THE OUTWORN CONCEPTION OF GRAMMAR WHICH IT IMPLIES SEEM NOT TO REALIZE THAT THEY ARE FIGHTING THE FLOOD OF IRRESISTIBLE PROGRESS IN EDUCATION THE ALL BUT UNIVERSAL DISFAVOR INTO WHICH THE SUBJECT OF GRAMMAR HAS FALLEN NOT ALONE IN THE HIGHER CIRCLES OF PEDAGOGICAL THOUGHT BUT AMONG THE PRACTICAL AND PROGRESSIVE TEACHERS OF OUR PRIMARY AND SEC ONDARY SCHOOLS BEARS WITNESS TO THE FACT THAT THIS SUBJECT IS GOING THE WAY OF BOTANY AND ZOOLOGY OF PSYCHOLOGY AND LOGIC WHOSE CONVERSION FROM FORMAL TO BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES IS A MATTER OF COMPARATIVELY RECENT HISTORY THE ADVOCATES OF THE STRAIGHTLINE DIAGRAM ARE PLAYING TODAY THE ROLE OF OBJECTORS FIFTY YEARS AGO TO THE STUDY OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY HOW DOES THE EMBRYOLOGY THE PHYSIOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE PLANT STRUCTURE HELP US TO CLASSIFY A BUTTERCUP IN THE GENUS RANUNCU LACEEE  THEY INQUIRED SCORNFULLY BUT WE HAVE FOUND THAT THERE ARE THINGS MORE VITAL IN THE SCIENCE OF BOTANY THAN THE LINNSEAN CLASSIFICA TION IT IS NOW SOMEWHAT LATE IN THE DAY FOR PROTEST AGAINST THE DOMINANT TENDENCY IN EDUCATION TO VIEW ALL STRUCTURES FROM THE STAND POINT OF GROWTH OF EVOLUTION THIS TENDENCY HAS BEEN UNSUCCESSFULLY RESISTED IN SCIENCE AND IN PHILOSOPHY CAN WE HOPE THAT EVEN THE STERN ENCASEMENTS OF GRAMMAR WILL BE ABLE TO PREVAIL AGAINST IT  470THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE DIAGRAMI IT IS TRUE THAT THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SENTENCE HAS NOT YET BEEN DIGESTED INTO A DETAILED METHOD OF TEACHING GRAMMAR BUT PATIENCE NO GENUINE SYSTEM OF TEACHING ANY SUBJECT SPRINGS FULLGROWN INTO BIRTH BUT FORMS ITSELF SLOWLY OUT OF A NEW POINT OF VIEW SUCH AS IN GRAMMAR THE LATER THEORY OF SENTENCESTRUCTURE AFFORDS AND CERTAINLY THE SUGGESTION THAT THE ORGANIC CONSTITUTION OF THE SENTENCE BE REPRE SENTED BY THE GROWING DIAGRAM SUCH AS THAT OF THE TREE THE AMOEBA OR THE SOLAR SYSTEM RATHER THAN BY THE STATIC DIAGRAM OF CROSSING STRAIGHT LINES IS NOTHING UNLESS IT BE A PRACTICAL SUGGESTION LOOKING TOWARD THE PEDAGOGY OF THE NEW GRAMMAR THE WHOLE POINT OF THE PAPER READ AT THE ENGLISH CONFERENCE IN ANN ARBOR AND LATER PUBLISHED IN THE EDUCATIONAL REVIEW WAS THE RECOMMENDATION THAT A DIAGRAM BE USED IN TEACHING GRAMMAR WHICH REPRESENTS TRULY THE BIOLOGICAL DEVELOP MENT OF THE SENTENCETHOUGHT THIS THE TREE DIAGRAM DOES THIS THE STRAIGHTLINE DIAGRAM DOES NOT AND SINCE IT IS COMPLAINED THAT CER TAIN ADVANTAGES ACCRUING FROM THE USE OF THE STRAIGHTLINE DIAGRAM HAVE BEEN IGNORED LET IT BE SAID THAT BOTH THESE ADVANTAGES THOSE OF REPRESENTING SENTENCESTRUCTURE TO THE EYE OF THE PUPIL AND OF SERVING AS A STENOGRAPHIC DEVICE FOR THE TEACHER ARE SECURED EQUALLY WELL BY THE USE OF THE BIOLOGICAL DIAGRAM AND FURTHERMORE IF THIS WERE NOT SO NO CONCEIVABLE ADVANTAGES COULD NEUTRALIZE THE TREMENDOUS DISADVAN TAGE OF UNTRUTHFULNESS IF THE STRAIGHTLINE DIAGRAM IS NOT TRUE TO THE STRUCTURE OF THE SENTENCE ITS SUPPORTERS HAVE NO ARGUMENTS FOR IT STRONG ENOUGH TO OVERBEAR THAT FACT THE WHOLE MATTER LIES HERE THERE IS ONLY ONE QUESTION TO SETTLE AND THAT IS THE QUESTION DOES THE STRAIGHTLINE DIAGRAMI TRUTHFULLY REPRESENT THE ACTUAL STRUCTURE OF THE SENTENCE AND FOR THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WE HAVE NO APPEAL BUT TO MODERN PSYCHOLOGY WHICH AT ONCE AND EMPHATICALLY NEGATIVES PROFESSOR BARBOURS STATEMENT THAT THE STRAIGHTLINE DIAGRAM DOES IN A GENERAL WAY FAIRLY REPRESENT THE GRAMMATICAL STRUCTURE OF THE ENGLISH SENTENCE THE STRAIGHTLINE DIAGRAM UNQUALIFIEDLY MISREPRE SENTS THAT STRUCTURE AS IT IS UNDERSTOOD BY THE ACCREDITED PSYCHOLOGY OF THE PRESENT DAY AND IN THE FACE OF THIS FACT ALL MINOR CONTENTIONS FADE INTO THE BACKGROUND ALLOW ME TO CORRECT A MISAPPREHENSION ON THE PART OF PROFESSOR BARBOUR THE GENESIS OF THE SENTENCE IS NOT OF HISTORICAL INTEREST ALONE OR EVEN CHIEFLY SINCE SUCH GENESIS TAKES PLACE IN THE MIND OF EVERY CHILD WHO UTTERS A SENTENCE IT IS THE DEVELOPMENT IN THE SPEAKERS MIND OF THE INCHOATE THOUGHT INTO CLEARLY DIFFERENTIATE UTTER 471THE SCHOOL REVI EW ANCE THAT CONCERNS US I SHOULD NOT CARE TO AFFIRM THAT THE INTERJECTION WAS HISTORICALLY THE EARLIEST FORM OF SPEECH THOUGH FROM PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS I MIGHT BE INCLINED TO THAT VIEW THAT PUZZLE HAS I BELIEVE BEEN RELINQUISHED BY PHILOLOGISTS AND I AM NOT SO RASH AS TO ATTEMLPT ITS SOLUTION OFFHAND WHAT I DO ASSERT IS ONLY THAT THE INTER JECTION REPRESENTS ADEQUATELY THE FIRST VAGUE STAGE OF A THOUGHT IN THE MIND OF THE PERSON WHO AFTERWARDS UTTERS FROM IT A SOMEWHAT PRIMITIVE SENTENCE FROM INTERJECTION TO DEVELOPED SENTENCE IS THE PROGRESS OF A SINGLE THOUGHT IN A SINGLE HUMIAN BRAIN BEYOND THAT WE NEED NOT FOR OUR PURPOSES GO PROFESSOR BARBOUR RIGHTLY SAYS IF WE TEACH GRAMMAR PEDAGOGI CALLY WE SHALL MAKE THE SENTENCE OUR POINT OF DEPARTURE I WOULD NOT ONLY INDORSE THIS STATEMENT BUT GO A STEP FURTHER STILL AND SAY THAT THE SENTENCE MUST BE OUR POINT OF DEPARTURE AND ALSO OF RETURN IT IS AT ONCE THE STARTING POINT AND GOAL IT IS RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD THE WHOLE SUBJECT OF GRAMMAR AND IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT I LNUST AGAIN URGE THE FUNDAMENTAL NECESSITY OF REGARDING THE SENTENCE FROM THE PSYCHOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW NOT AS THE MATHEMATICAL FORMULA SUB JECT  PREDICATE  SENTENCE BUT AS A LIVING AND GROWING ORGANISNM WHICH HAS DEVELOPED FROM A SIMPLE TO A COMPLEXER UNITY LET US HAVE DONE AS SPEEDILY AS MAY BE WITH THE MECHANICAL EPLURIBUS UNUM CON CEPTION OF THE SENTENCE AND READ THE DEVELOPMENT OF EXPRESSION AS WE HAVE COME TO READ THAT OF LIFE AND OF THOUGHT IN TERMS OF BIOLOGICAL GROWTH GERTRUDE BUCK INDIANAPOIIS IND 472

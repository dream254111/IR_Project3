preservation of their estate On the con trary it appears that the income from the estate is insufficient to furnish a support for Mrs Leavell and her family and that they possess no other source of revenue either to keep down the accruing interest on the loan or to discharge the principal sum at maturity The debt of Mrs Grasty constitutes a charge both on the life estate of Mrs Leavell and the estate in remainder of her infant children and should therefore be borne proportionately by both Yet in the circumstances detailed the result of the proposed arrangement would inure to the benefit of the life tenant espe cially if the interest were not paid at the expense of the remain dermen The debt must ultimately be paid out of the estate and it is to the interest of the infants that such payment shall be made as soon as practicable in order that the life estate may bear its due proportion of the common burden 1 In the absence of some provision in the will on the sub ject we know of no

VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Error to Law and Chancery Court of City of Norfolk Assumpsit by the City of Norfolk against the Norfolk  Portsmouth Traction Company There was a judgment for plaintiff and defendant brings error Affirmed H W Anderson of Richmond and Walter H Taylor of Norfolk for plaintiff in error Geo C Cabell of Norfolk for defendant in error WHITTLE J This is an action of assumpsit brought by the defendant in error the city of Norfolk against the plaintiff in error the Norfolk  Portsmouth Traction Company to recover by way of damages the cost of materials and labor furnished and done by the plaintiff in laying wood block paving in repav ing between and for two feet beyond the outer rails of the de fendants tracks on Granby street and for similar repaving with wood block and bitulithic paving on Botetourt street also for furnishing materials and laying extra concrete base under the defendants tracks in connection with such repaving The de fendant paid the cost of labor for the work but denied liability for the cost of materials There was a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff for 2206093 to which judgment this writ of error was awarded The question for our determination is whether the defendant is responsible for the cost of materials furnished by the plaintiff 1 On January 4 1866 the General Assembly incorporated the Norfolk City Railroad Company the predecessor of the plaintiff in error granting the company the privilege of laying its tracks in the streets of the city of Norfolk but upon condi tion that the consent of the council of the city should be first ob tained Clause 3 of the charter provides That said company shall keep that portion of the street occupied by its track or tracks embracing the space between said tracks and a distance of at least two feet beyond the outer rails thereof well paved and in good repair without expense to the corporation of the city of Norfolk and the rails used for said tracks shall be of the most approved pattern for such purposes and shall be laid at the distance of five feet five inches between the outer ridges or flanges thereof so as to form as little obstruction as practi cable to the passage of carriages or other vehicles along or over said tracks This controversy arises not so much over the interpretation of the foregoing clause the language of which is free from ambiguity as it does with respect to the attempted modifica tion of the obligations thereby imposed upon the company by 278 Aug1913 NORFOLK ETC CO V CITY OF NORFOLK section 9 of an ordinance passed by the city council December 14 1887 Section 9 is as follows The said railway shall be so made and laid down as to conform to the established or proposed grades of the several streets to be occupied by it as given by the city engineer and in case the several streets occupied by it shall in the future be paved or repaved the city of Norfolk shall furnish and deliver the material therefor upon said streets and have the work done but the proprietors or lessees of said railway shall pay the said city for the cost of labor for paving the same between the tracks and two feet on each side thereof such amount in case of nonpayment by the company for a period of thirty days after the work is done to be recoverable by legal proceedings in the name of the city And in case the grade of said streets or any of them or any part thereof shall be changed hereafter the proprietors or lessees of the said rail way at their own expense shall make corresponding alterations of the said tracks and the owners proprietors or lessees of the said railway shall keep the streets covered by said tracks and extending two feet on the outer limits of each side of said tracks in thorough repair at their own expense We have no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that as an original proposition the predecessor of the defendant was under charter obligation to keep its portion of the streets as therein defined well paved and in good repair and at its own expense The charter so declares in language too plain to call for con struction or to admit of controversy See also Va Code 1904  1294i 3 which authorizes a street railway company with the consent of the municipal authorities to lay its tracks in the streets but likewise imposes upon such company the duty to re store the pavements of the streets and to maintain them in good condition The apparent conflict among the authorities on the subject of the extent of the liability of these companies is due to differ ences in the language of their charters For example in the case of Chicago v Sheldon 9 Wall 54 19 L Ed 594 so much relied on by the plaintiff in error the charter there construed was quite different from this charter It required the company to keep its portion of the street in good repair while the language here employed is to keep it well paved and in good repair In construing language similar to that found in the present charter in cases arising in some of the most progressive and important cities of the country the trend of the more recent and best considered decisions is to hold street railway companies 27919 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER to a high degree of responsibility and strict compliance with their charter duties in relation to their occupancy of streets The courts proceed upon the theory that franchises granted to such companies are in derogation of common right and are considered an encroachment upon the primary use of the streets by the public and the principle is fundamental that such grants are to be construed most strongly against the grantee Hence it is said A charter having the elements of a contract granted to a street railway company is to be strictly construed against the company and it has no doubtful rights under such charter for when there are doubts they are construed against the grantee and in favor of the city Western Paving  Supply Co v Citizens St R Co 128 Ind 525 26 N E 188 28 N E

doctrine that the obligation resting upon a street railway com pany to keep its portion of the streets well paved and in good repair or language of like import necessarily involves the duty to keep pace with the growth and progress of the city and to conform its work to the policy of the municipality in the matter of street improvement Hence for a company to pave with cobblestones could not be regarded as a compliance with its duty to keep its part of the street well paved and in good repair where the rest of the street is laid with wood block or bitulithic pavement In District of Columbia v Washington R R Co 4 Mackey D C 214 it was held That where a street railway com panys charter required it to keep its tracks and the space be tween the rails and two feet outside well paved and in good re pair it could be required to construct a pavement where one did not exist before its road was built anad to construct such kind of pavement as the authorities should direct So in the case of Mayor of the City of New York v Harlem Bridge M  F Ry Co 186 N Y 304 78 N E 1072 the clause of the charter provided The said grantees or their successors shall keep the surface of the street inside the rails and for one foot outside thereof in good and proper order and repair and conform the tracks to the grades of the streets or avenues as they now are or may hereafter be changed by the 280 Aug1913 NORFOLK ETC CO V CITY OF NORFOLK authorities of the aforesaid towns The court construing this clause says While this statute does not itself specify as in the case of the railroad law that this shall be done under the supervision of the municipal authorities and in accordance with their specifications that necessarily follows from the general duties and powers conferred upon such authorities by law Therefore when the proper authorities in view of the condition of the street as show to exist decided that a granite block pave ment should be laid we think that the requirement for repairing and keeping in good order compelled the defendant to cooperate with the city and put the space between its rails in the same con dition as the rest of the street even though that necessitated the laying of a new pavement It has been held elsewhere by this court that an obligation couched in substantially similar language resting upon a railroad company will compel it under proper conditions to lay a new kind of pavement    The ques tion of what shall constitute keeping a pavement in the tracks of a railroad company in good order and repair is to be determined somewhat at least by reference to existing and surrounding conditions and in our judgment it would be altogether too nar row a view to hold that where a municipality had for sufficient reason decided to pave a street with asphalt or other new pave ment a railroad might discharge its obligations to keep its part of the street in good order and repair by merely patching up a dirt road or some species of pavement which had become anti quated and out of condition and which was entirely different from that adopted in the remainder of the street Columbus St Ry Co v City of Columbus 43 Ind App 265 86 N E

materials furnished and work done on the extra concrete base were rendered necessary by the in creased size and weight of the defendants rails and rolling stock and was of nO benefit to the city except to prevent damage to the surface of the street from inadequate foundation The case in that aspect is controlled by the case of Washing ton  Georgetown Ry Co v District of Columbia 108 U S 522 2 Sup Ct 865 27 L Ed 807 The court there held Where a street railway company is by law bound to keep the space within its tracks and for two feet beyond them well paved which part of the paving is more costly than that of the rest of the street the extra and separable expense of such part of the paving should be assessed exclusively to the company and such company is not entitled to be relieved from a tax for paving the 28119 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER street by paving the proportion thereof which the width which it is obliged to pave bears to the width of the whole street 3 We shall next consider the contention of the plaintiff in error that whatever may have been its original charter obliga tions it has been released by the city ordinance from all respon sibility in the matter of paving its part of the streets except only the liability to pay the city the cost of labor in doing the work We are of the opinion that the paving and repairing clause of the charter is mandatory and that the city ordinance which un dertakes to repeal it in whole or in part is ultra vires and void The General Assembly in granting the charter saw fit to impose upon the company the duty of keeping the part of the streets oc cupied by its tracks as therein defined paved and in good re pair without expense to the corporation of the city of Norfolk and the city council had no power to shift that burden from the company to the municipality 4 It is said however that this controversy is only between the city and the company and therefore that the state is not in terested in the result and that the city is estopped to question the validity of its own ordinance The question is not one of policy as to whether the expense shall be borne by the city or the company but of power If the city has power to relieve the company from one of its mandatory charter obligations it has power to relieve it from all and any agreement that leads to such a result cannot be sound If the ordinance be ultra vires and void it cannot of course operate as an estoppel In Roanoke Gas Co v Roanoke 88 Va 810 14 S E 665 it was held that the powers of a municipal corporation with respect to its streets are continuing and inalienable So in Basic City v Bell 114 Va  76 S E 336 it was doubted whether the doctrine of equitable estoppel exists in this state as regards the powers and obligations of a municipal cor poration over its streets In City of Reading v United Traction Co 215 Pa 250 64 Atl 446 7 Ann Cas 380 see also notes to the principal case it was held that a street railway company in the absence of ex press contract or statutory direction is bound to keep the por tions of the streets occupied by its right of way in proper repair The court also observes That the streets of a city belong to the state for the use of the people at large To the municipality as its agent it commits the duty of at all times keeping them in proper repair for the convenience and safety of the public This duty of the municipality does not shift except when it is ex pressly or imposed upon another City of Richmond v Smith 101 Va 161 43 S E 345 Bellenot v City of Richmond 108 Va 282 Aug1913 NORFOLK ETC CO V CITY OF NORFOLK 314 61 S E 785 White Oak Coal Co v City of Manchester 109 Va 749 64 S E 944 132 Am St Rep 943 These principles are grounded upon the general proposition that the Legislature subject only to constitutional limitation has supreme control over streets and highways while on the other hand the power of a municipality is dependent upon and meas ured by delegation from the government and is held and ex ercised in subordination to its will The one exerts sovereign power the other granted power and holds its streets as trustee for the general public The opinion handed down at the present term in the case of Danville v Danville Ry  Elec Co 76 S E 913 is in harmony with the views herein expressed Upon the whole case we are of opinion that the judgment is without error and shotrld be affirmed Affirmed Upon Petition to Rehear PER CURIAM The specific ground upon which a rehearing of this case is sought is because it is said the traction company was not called on in the first instance by the city to repave its portion of the streets And granting that the company was under char ter obligation to do such repaving nevertheless until after no tice it had refused to comply with such demand the city had no authority to do the work at the companys expense and therefore could not maintain an action to recover the cost of the work done It is said that this proposition is so plainly correct that it is un answerable and complaint is made that it was not noticed in the opinion of the court 5 The omission was not an inadvertence The assignment was not discussed in the opinion simply because no such ques tion was properly raised by the record and it was therefore not within the cognizance of an appellate court So far as the record discloses no such defense was relied on in the trial court and no exception was taken on that ground If the question had been raised in the lower court non constat but that the city could readily have proved notice and demand The company was si lent when it should have spoken and it will not be heard to speak when it should be silent It affirmatively appears from the agreed statement of facts that the question involved in this case is the liability of the Nor folk  Portsmouth Traction Company for the cost of the material used in laying wooden blocks on the portion of Granby street and Botetourt street lying between the tracks and two feet on each side thereof in the year 1910 and for the cost of the material in an extra concrete foundation under the tracks 28319 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER It is a fundamental rule of practice that exceptions of every kind when necessary at all should be taken in the court whose judgment is to be reviewed Otherwise the appellate court would be converted into one of original jurisdiction See note to War ren v Warren 2 Va L Reg 195 196 Burks J in Redd v Supervisors 31 Grat 72 Va 695 at page 711 observes We can only review the case made and as made by the parties in the court below We cannot go outside of the record and decide a case upon facts dehors This would in my judgment be a palpable and flagrant abuse of appellate ju risdiction So also in Camden v Doremus 3 How 515 11 L Ed 705 it was said It would be more extraordinary still if under the mask of such an objection or mere hint at objection a party should be permitted in an appellate court to spring upon his ad versary defects which it did not appear he ever relied on and which if they existed and had been openly and specifically al leged might have been easily cured Warren v Warren 93 Va 73 24 S E 913 Lambert v Jenkins 112 Va 376 71 S E 718 Ann Cas 1913B 778 Authorities could be multiplied upon this obvious and settled rule of appellate practice but the foregoing sufficiently illus trate it It was upon these considerations that the court did not feel called upon to notice in its opinion the assignment to which at tention is now invited Rehearing denied Note The duty of a street railway company to keep in good repair that portion of the street occupied by its roadbed seems to be well set tled in all jurisdictions this responsibility not depending upon con tractual relations The duty to keep in good repair and the duty to pave or repave however are placed upon entirely distinct and different grounds of liability In regard to the former duty the railway company stands in the shoes of the municipality and as sumes the burden originally resting upon it The duty to repair and keep the streets in good order primarily belongs to the municipal ity exercising the authority delegated to it by the state and when a railway company is granted the right to use the streets such grant carries with it the liability to keep in good repair unless it be spe cifically exempted therefrom by the terms of the grant or charter The duty of a street railway company to pave or its liability for the expense of paving its right of way depends entirely upon the statutory enactment or contract as expressed in the statute or or dinance There is apparently considerable conflict between decisions as to the liability of a street railway company for paving or repaving its right of way and specified distances adjacent thereto but this is due chiefly to the different terms and provisions of the various statutes or ordinances The right to require such duty of a rail way company is unquestioned A general statute which requires 284 Aug1913 NORFOLK ETC CO V CITY OF NORFOLK 285 street railway companies to pave and repave a certain space be tween and outside their tracks and to pay the cost thereof is not an unreasonable exercise of the reserved power to amend or alter the charter which required such companies to keep the street be tween its tracks and for two feet on each side thereof in good and sufficient repair and is not unconstitutional as depriving the com pany of its property without due process of law or as impairing the obligation of the contract contained in the original grant or fran chise to use the streets 5 U S E 584 Citing Fair Haven etc R Co z New Haven 203 U S 379 51 L Ed 237 27 S Ct 74 In the present case there is no question of the liability of the railway company for its proportionate share of the expense of pav ing certain streets its statutory charter clearly providing for such responsibility The two questions of peculiar interest presented here are First can a municipality by ordinance or contract with a street railway company decrease or lessen the duty of the com pany to pave or repave between its tracks and for certain specified distances adjacent thereto as provided by statute secondly can a company be held liable for the cost of such paving or repaving where the city fails to give due notice that such paving is required and proceeds to do the work itself and afterward demands payment of the company for its proportionate share This latter point was not passed on by the court in the present case for the reason that it was not raised by the record and therefore was not properly be fore the court for determination The giving or failing to give this notice may well govern or fix a railway companys liability and we have collected the authorities on this point as will appear further in this note The right of a municipality to decrease the liability of a street railway bound by statutory provisions to pave between its tracks and within specified distances therefrom has been passed on by the New York court which reached the same conclusion as our own court in the present case In Kent v Common Council of City of Binghamton 81 N Y Supp 198 40 Misc Rep 1 the court said Where under its char ter a street railway company is bound to pave between its tracks and for two feet on either side of them an agreement by it with the city that it shall be liable for only onefifth of the expense of the paving is invalid In the case of Conway v City of Rochester 157 N Y 33 38 51 N E 395 396 the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeals uses expressive language prohibiting such a gift by a municipal corporation in favor of a railroad company The mu nicipal authorities are given no power to relieve a railroad corpora tion of the whole or any portion of the needed repairs or to impose the whole or any portion of the cost upon the abutting owners or the city at large The learned Appellate Division adopts that rea soning in its disposition of the case at bar Kent v Common Coun cil 61 AppDiv 323 70 N Y Supp 465 Id 72 App Div 623 76 N Y Supp 584 This doctrine in effect was affirmed by the Court of Appeals in

Council of City of Binghamton 56 N Y Supp 105 26 Misc Rep 208 The common council of the city of Binghamton was wholly without power to exempt the defendant19 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER from the provisions of the general railroad law No such power is found in the charter of the city and none can be implied To hold that the common council possessed such power would be to hold that the common council of every city could by resolution or con tract render nugatory the general railroad law so far as it imposed upon street surface railroad companies the duty of sharing the expense of paving Nor where the charter of a street railway company fixes the lia bility of the company for street paving can the city enlarge it When the extent of the liability of the corporation to the mu nicipality for the taxes or street repairs has been fixed by the leg islature the city has no power to enlarge it The attempt to do so would not be regulation of the manner of the exercise of the priv ilege but the imposition of a condition which would operate as a denial In this case the liability of the Philadelphia  Darby Comn pany was fixed by the legislature Its duty was to repair so much of the street as lay between its tracks and no more The duty of the defendant its lessee is to bear the burden imposed by law on its lessor and the city can no more add to the burden of the one than of the other City of Philadelphia v Philadelphia City Pass R Co 177 Pa 379 35 Atl 720 721 In Fort St etc R R Co z Schneider 15 Mich 74 it was shown that the railway company was authorized by a city ordinance ac cepted by it to construct a railway on Croghan street By an amendment to that ordinance also accepted by it the railway com pany was obligated as follows to wit If the city of Detroit pave Croghan street contemporaneously with the laying of the track on said street said railway company shall pave their track on said street and two feet four inches on either side thereof at their own expense This contemporaneous paving the city resolved to do and did do The assessment which was made against the com plainants embraced an item for grading and excavating as well as for paving said portion of said street It was held that by the terms of said amended ordinance the obligation to pave assumed by the complainants did not indlude an obligation to excavate with ref erence to grade but that the city was to provide for all the work preliminary to the actual paving Where an ordinance of a city which grants to a horse railway company the privilege of using its streets requires such railway to keep portions of the street on which it operates in good repair the city cannot by a subsequent ordinance compel the company to pave such portions of its street with specified materials or punish anyone concerned for operating the cars of the company where the paving was not done Such later ordinance would be an inter ference with the contract between the city and the railway as con tained in the ordinance granting the latter its franchise Kansas v Corrigan 86 Mo 67 Preliminary Demand or Notice by CityUnder an ordinance re quiring a street railway company to pave after notice by the high way

CITY OF NORFOLK it was held in an action against a street railway company by a city to recover for paving a portion of a street with asphalt the citymust show that the repairs were necessary that notice had been given by the city to the defendant to repair the tracks by paving them with asphalt and that the repairing was reasonable neces sary and proper In the case of Conway v City of Rochester 157 N Y 33 51 N E 395 the action was brought by a taxpayer and also an abutting owner upon the street to enjoin the city from paving the space be tween the tracks of the Rochester Railroad Company and charging the expense thereof upon the abutting owner It was held con struing  98 of the railroad law that the duty of making such pave ment devolved upon the railroad company after it had received a no tice from the city so to do and if it did not comply with the require ments of the notice the pavement should be made at the expense of the company and not that of the abutting owners It is true that it was also then held that it was the duty of the municipal authorities to give the street railroad company 30 days notice which under  98 was mandatory but that pertained to a paving of the street practi cally the making of a new street and did not have reference to a hole existing which endangered the lives and property of persons pass ing over the street Schuster v FortySecond St M

certain kind of paving between the rails and afterwards conform to such style of paving as the city might order In case the road refused or omitted to pave the same was to be done by the city at the roads expense The city charter as amended by Laws 1889 c 317 provided that whenever the city should order the paving of any street onehalf the expense was to be borne by the city and the other half by the property benefited hut that nothing therein should be held to repeal or affect any ex isting license or contract A resolution of council afterwards passed ordered the property owners on River street to pave the street within ten days or in default the city would pave and apportion the expense to the property benefited Held that such resolution did not contemplate paving under the ordinance and as the railroad was not given the notice required by the ordinance nor reasonable time it was not liable for the paving between the rails amounting to about onethird of the assessment but only for its pro rato share of onehalf the expense of paving the entire street Tray etc R Co v Coffey 66 Hun 160 21 N Y Supp 34 Sufficiency of NoticeWhen after notice the company fails to do the work so

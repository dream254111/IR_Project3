terrible massacres of the Jews in I391 form a turning point in Spanish history They mark the end of the ages of toleration during which the Peninsula afforded a refuge to the unfortunate children of Israel and the commencement of the fierce spirit of persecution which rendered the Inquisition inevitable which expelled the Jews and Moors and which by insisting on absolute uniformity of belief condemned Spain to the material and intellectual lethargy that marked its period of decadence The popular temper which rendered the massacres possible had been in course of development for a generation but the outbreak was the work of one man Ferrand Martinez Archdeacon of Ecija who presents himself to us as the ideal example of the mediaeval zealot The document hitherto inedited appended to this paper throws some light on the movements preliminary to the massacres and on the unbending resolution of the man to accomplish what he re garded as his duty to God1 In spite of the canon law which condemns the Jews to per petual servitude in punishment for the Crucifixion and in spite of the repeated urgency of the Holy See Spain up to the fourteenth century had consistently treated them with a reasonable degree of equity They were not popular favorites however for their keen intelligence and business capacity had enabled them to control the finances of the land both public and private and the occupations of farmers of the revenue taxcollectors and moneylenders which 1 Amador de los Rios in his monumental Historia tie los 7udios de Espafia has printed several papers relating to these events but the present one apparently escaped his researches as it shows that some of the minor details in his narrative are incorrect  229210 H C Lea were almost exclusively in their hands were not calculated to ingratiate them with the people while the ostentation with which their wealth was displayed was provocative of illfeeling There was thierefore a certain amount of latent popular prejudice which was capable of being aroused to activity and to this task the Church of Spain addressed itself The general council of Vielnne in I31113I12 althoucrh it did not add to the numerous oppressive canons directed against the Jews took occasion to reprehend in the strongest manner the freedom of worship allowed in Spain to the Moors and it sharpened the decrees against usury The Spanish prelates at the council in their intercourse with their brethren from other lands doubtless had full opportunity of learn ing what was thought of Spanish tolerance towards both Moors and Jews and they seem to have returned home fully inspired with the proscriptive spirit for the provincial councils subsequently held throughout Spain eagerly endeavored to separate the races and to destroy the kindly intercourse and neighborliness which had existed from time immemorial2 Undoubtedly these efforts must have stimulated prejudice and sharpened antagonism but they were barren of visible results for the Jews were too useful to the ruling classes to lack protectors Not only were they indis pensable to the royal filnances but the heavy taxation levied upon them formed a notable and most reliable portion of the revenues of the crown and of the nobles the churches and the municipalities Pedro the Cruel was a friend of the Jews and it is a sign of their growing unpopularity that his rebellious bastard brother Henry of Trastamara found his account in persecuting them When in I355 Henry and his brother the Master of Santiago entered Toledo to liberate Queen Blanche of Bourbon confined in the alcazar they sacked the smaller Juderla and slew its twelve hundred inhabitants without sparing age or sex they also be sieged the principal Juderla which was defended by Pedros friends until his arrival with reinforcements compelled the assail ants to withdlraw Five years later when in I360 Henry invaded Castile with the aid of Pedro IV of Aragon on reaching Najara he ordered a nmassacre of the Jews and as Ayala states that this was done to win popularity it may be assumed that he granted free license to plunder When at length in 1366 Henry led into 1 Clementin Lib

Companions the slaughter of the Jews was terrible Multitudes fled and the French chronicler deplores the number that found refuge in Paris and preyed upon the people with their usuries The Alfama or Jewish community of Toledo purchased exemption with a ransom of a million maravedises raised in fifteen days to pay off the mer cenaries but as for a time the whole land lay at the mercy of the reckless freebooters pillage and slaughter were general Finally the assassination of Pedro at Montiel in 1349 deprived the Jews of their protector and left Henry undisputed master of the land When the news of the fratricide reached Avignon Urban V asked the Bishop of Sarlat whether the Pope and the Church ought to rejoice over Pedros death slain by his bastard brother seeing that he was a rebel towards the Church a fautor of Jews and Moors a propagator of infidelity and a slayer of Christians To this the bishop replied that he rejoiced at the expiation of crime but pitied the man when Urban sternly rejoined Have you not read in the Psalms The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the ven geance  2 Thus the people were becoming educated to slaughter and pillage of the dlefenceless Jew but he was too necessary to the state to be abandoned and even Henry of Trastamara was forced to give him a measure of protection Yet legislation was becom ing unfriendly and the ecclesiastics had freer scope to excite abhorrence and stimulate popular passion The conditions existedl for a catastrophe and Ferrand Martinez was the man to precipi tate it He was not only Archdeacon of Ecija but he occupied a distinguished position in the great archiepiscopal see of Seville where he was canon of the cathedral and Official or judicial rep resentative of the archbishop Pedro Barroso He was a man of indomitable firmness and thougrh without much learning he was highly esteemed for his distinguished piety his solid virtues and his eminent charity the latter of which qualities he evinced by founding and maintaining the Hospital of Santa Marla in Seville3 Unfortunately he was a fanatic and the Jews were the object of hiis renmorseless zeal which his position gave him ample oppor tuinity of exercising to their injury In his sermons he denounced them savagely and excited against them the passions of the people keeping them in constanit fear of an outbreak as ecclesiastical 1 Ayala

I395 n 2 ailo 1404 n 4212 H C Lea judge he extended his jurisdiction over them against all law and precedent and his decisions naturally followed the bent of his prejudices to their great loss and disadvantage Moreover in conjunction with other episcopal officials he issued letters to the local authorities of the towns of the diocese ordering them to expel the Jews and to suffer none to reside within their limits letters which he endeavored to enforce by personal visitation The Aljma of Seville which was the largest and the richest in the kingdom became seriously alarmed and made complaint to the king Little as Henry of Trastamara was favorably disposed to the Jews the threatened disturbances boded consequences too serious to his finances to be disregarded and in August I378 he addressed a formal command to Ferrand Martinez to desist from his evil courses nor was this the first time as is shown by an allusion to previous letters of the same import To this Martinez paid no obedience he continued to persecute the Jews judicially and to inflame the people against them in his sermons The AJiama had recourse to the Holy See and procured certain bulls for their protection which Martinez disregarded as contemptuously as he had done the royal mandate Complaint was again made to the throne and Juan I who had succeeded his father Henry II in I382 again commanded Martinez not to preach agrainst them and to abandon his usurped jurisdiction over them This did not silence him for another royal letter of 1383 complains that he asserted in his sermons that he knew that the king would regard it as a service if any one should assault or damage or slay the Jews and that all such might feel assured of impunity As this portended the complete destruction of the Juderla of Seville the king threatened him with severe and exemplary punishment unless he should desist Yet matters went on as before and the next information we have is in I388 when the frightened AIama sum moned Martinez before the alcaldes of the city and had the three royal letters read publicly requiring him to obey them He replied with insults and a week later put in a formal answer to the effect that he could not preach otherwise than he did for he only repeated what Christ and the prophets had said of them that when he endeavored to enforce the laws requiring complete sepa ration between Christian and Jew he was but obeying the com mands of the archbishop and that if he were to execute the law he would tear down all the twentythree synagogues in Seville seeing that they had all been illegally erected 1 Amador de los Rios II 57989 It is not much to the credit of Christians that Martinez was justified in his assertion as to the synagogues As early as 423 HonoriusFerrand Martinez aind thie Massacres of 1391 2I3 The dean and chapter became alarmed at the archdeacons intemperate zeal and appealed to the king to suppress it but Juan in place of enforcing his neglected commands merely replied that he would look into the matter the zeal he said of the arch deacon was holy but it must not be allowed to cause disturbance for although the Jews were wicked they were under the royal protection This royal vacillation naturally encouraged Martinez who became more inflammatory in his harangues than ever and symptoms of popular excitement against the Jews became mani fest No one dared to interfere in their defence but at length Martinez furnished an excuse for silencing him by asserting in a sermon that the Pope had no power to license the erection of synagogues This involved the papal authority and not the Jewish question and the opportunity was seized of summoning him before an assembly of theologians and doctors From a sentence pronounced August 2 1389 by Archbishop Barroso we learn that he refused to answer except before the people and on his per sistingr in this he was ordered not to preach about the power of the Pope but he disobeyed thus rendering himself contumacious and suspect of heresy He even taught that the Pope could not grant dispensations to the clergy to marry and that he could not absolve from sins wherefore on August 2 the archbishop suspended him both as to jurisdiction and preaching till his trial should be concluded2 This afforded the Jews a breathingspace but Archbishop Barroso died July 7 1390 followed October 9 by Juan I The chapter must have secretly sympathized with Martinez for it elected him one of the provisors of the diocese sede vacantc thus clothing him with greater power than ever and we hear nothing more of his trial for heresy which evidently was discontinued with the archbishops death Juan had left as his successor Henry III known as ElDoliente or the Invalid a child of eleven and quarrels threatening civil war at once arose over the question of the regency Martinez had now nothing to fear from any quarter and he proceeded to put his convictions into practice by sending December 8 to the clergy and Theodosius II enacted that no new synagogues should be erected although existing ones were to le protected from the zeal of those who might endeavor to destroy them Cod Theodios Lib XVI Tit Viii 1 25 and this prohibition was sedulously maintained in the canon law cap iii viii Extra Lib V Tit vi The twentythree synagogues referred to were evidently those in the diocese of Seville In the city itself as we shall see there were but three at the time of the outbreak 1 Zufniga Annaees de Sevilla afno 1379 n 3 afno 1388 n 3 2 Amador de los Rios Il 5924214 H C Lea of the various towns commands under pain of excommunication to tear down within three hours the synagogues in which the enemies of God calling themselves Jews performed their idolatry the books including the Law were to be sent to himi and the building materials to be used for the repair of the churches if resistance were offered it was to be overcome by force and an interdict was to be laid on the towns until the work was accom plished These orders were not universally obeyed but enough ruin resulted to cause the frightened Aijama of Seville to make earnest representations to the regency threatening to emigrate if they could not be protected from Martinez The response to this we have in the subjoined Acta Chitular From this it appears that the regency acted with promptitude and decision On December 22 a missive was addressed to the dean and chapter which was formally read to them assembled for the purpose on January TO 1391 It recited the acts of Martinez for which it held them responsible seeing that they had elected him provisor with full knowledge of his character and had not prevented his unlawful proceedings wherefore they were liable for the cost of rebuildingr the ruined synagogues and for all damages suffered by the Jews It required them at once under pain of makingy good all past and future damages and of a fine of a thousand gold doblas each with other arbitrary punishment at the royal pleasure to remove Martinez from the provisorship and to force him by excommunication to rebuild the synagogues and to abstain from preaching and all other acts injurious to the Jews Letters of similar import were at the same time addressed to Martinez himself On January 15 the chapter again assembled and made a formal reply With the exception of one member Juan Ferrandez they protested their implicit submission to the royal commands they deprived Martinez of the provisorship and forbade him to exercise the office or to preach anything injurious to the Jews and ordered him within a year to rebuild and repair all the synagogrues destroyed by his orders This they presented as their official capitular action which Martinez must obey under pain of excommunication Then Martinez arose and made his reply The secular sword he said was in the hands of the king to coerce his lay subjects and defend the faith The spiritual sword was in the hands of the prelates who were not subject to the royal jurisdiction the royal letters invaded the ecclesiastical jurisdiction and were in valid The dean and chapter could not proceed against him or 1 Amador de los Rios 11 613Ferrand Martintez and lze Massacres of 1391 215 deprive him of his office or require him to rebuild the houses of the devil xvhich were synagrogues of Satan and in which thrice daily Christ and the king and all the Christian people were cursed for all the synagogues in the land had been built in violationi of the law and the canons As the sentence against him was null and void being rendered by those who were not his judges no appeal from it was necessary but as Christ and the hioly Catholic faith were the parties concerned he appealed to them to judge the matter and to inflict due penance oni those who conitravened their commands saving always the king whose ignorance ren dered him worthy of mercy Moreover he alleged truly eniough that he had been accused and conldemlined without an opportunity of defence He could prove that the synagogues had been de stroyed by order of the late Archbishop Barroso who had given them to his squires to do as they liked with them secing that they had been unlawfully built without licence andI two of them he had torn down durinig the archlishops life He concluded by declaring that he did not repent of anything that hie had done This dauntless defiance of the royal authority and of the capit ular sentence shows not only the intractable fanaticism of the man but his confidence in the support of his iellows and of the people whose passions he had been exciting for so many years The sequel proves that his confidence was not misplaced Whlat an swer the regency made to his denial of its jurisdiction over him we have no means of knowingr but whatever it was it exercised no restraint upon him His preaching continued as violent and incendiary as ever and the Seville mob grew excited with the prospect of gratifying at once its zeal for the faith and its thirst for pillagre In March the aspect of affairs was more alarming than ever the rabble were feeling their way with ouitrages and insults and the Juderla was in hourly dangrer of being sacked Juan Alonso Guzman Count of Niebla the most powerful noble of Andalusia was adelantado of the province and alcalde mayor of Seville and his kinsman Alvar Perez de Guzman was alguazil mayor On March I5 they seized some of the most turbulent of the crowd and proceeded to scourge two of them but in place of awing the populace this led only to open sedition The Guzmans were glad to escape with their lives and popular fury was directed agrainst the Jews resulting in considerable bloodshed and plunder but at length the authorities prevailed with the aid of the nobles and order was apparently restored By this time however the agitation was spreading to Cordoba Toledo Burgos and other cities Everywhere fanaticism and greed were aroused and the2I6 H C Lea Council of Regency vainly sent pressing commands to all the large towns in hopes of avertingr the catastrophe yet a royal orcler of April I5 withdrawing the privilegre that in Seville no building should be erected within crossbowshot of the Juderla could only be regarded as a conicession to the passions of the mob The archdeacon continued his inflammatory harangues and sought to ttirni to the advantagre of religion the storm which he had aroused by procuringr a general forcible conversion of the Jews The excitement grew till it became uncontrollable and on June 9 the tenmpest buirst in a general risingcr of the populace against the Junderia It was sacked and left a desert Few of its inhabitants escaped the number of the slain was reckoned at four thousand and those of the survivors who did not succeed in flying only preserved their lives by accepting baptism Of the three syna gogrues two were converted into churches for the Christians who settled in the Jewish quarter and the third sufficed for the misera ble remnanit of Israel which slowly gathered together after the storm had passed From Seville the flame leaped through Castile from shore to shore In the paralysis of public authority during the summer and early autumn of 1391 one city after another followed the example the Juderias were sacked the Jews who would not sub mit to baptism were slain and fanaticism and cupidity held their orgies unchecked The Moors escaped for although maniy wished to include them in the slaughter there was a wholesome restrain ing fear of reprisals upon the Christian captives in Granada and Africa The total number of victims was estimated at fifty thou sand but this is probably an exaggeration For this wholesale butchery and its accompanying rapine there was comnplete immu nity No attempt was mnade in Castile to punish the participators It is true that when Henry attained his majority in I395 and came to Seville he caused Ferrand Martinez to be arrested but the penalty inflicted must have been trivial for we are told that it did not affect the high estimation in which he was held anid on his death in 1404 he bequeathed valuable possessions to his foundation of the Hospital of Santa Maria2

the Castilian disturb ances afforded ample warning it was impossible to control the passions of the mob From July 9 when the Jews in Valencia were massacred until October the subterranean flame burst forth successively in one city after another Barcelona Palma Gerona Lrida Saragossa witnessed the same exhibitions of savage fanati cism Yet if Juan I found himself unable to prevent the massa cres he was determined to punish them and during the winter of 1391139g2 there were numerous executions of the most guilty participants Thus the Church had at last succeeded in Opening the long desired and irreparable chasm between Christian and Jew It had looked on silent if not approvlng while the Archdeacon of Eciija was bringing about the catastrophe nor did pope or prelate utter a word of reproach to stay the long tragedy of murder and spolia tion which they regarded as an act of God to bring the stubborn Hebrew into the fold of Christ The old friendliness between the races was a thing of the past and the final introduction of the Inquisition was rendered inevitable throu h the creation of a new classthat of the Conversos Marranos or New ChristiansJews who professed conversion to escape from slaughter At this dis tance of time it is of course impossible to apportion thei motives which led to the massacres between the attracti6n of disorder and pillage for the dangerous classes the odium entertained by many for the Jews and the faniaticism which served as an incentive and as a cloak for baser passions That the religious element however predominated would appear from the fact that everywhere the Jews were offered the alternative of death or baptism and that wherever willingness was shown to embrace Christianlity the mur derous work was at once suspended The pressure was so fierce and overwhelming that whole communities were baptized At Valencia an official report of the municipal authorities made on June 14 five days aft6r the massacre states that all the survivors except a few who were in hiding had already been baptized they came forward demanding baptism in such droves that in all the A Amador de los Rios IL 3924 In the eas of Jayme dez Mas aceued of

out nor was this by any means the only miracle which showed that the whole tragedy was the mysterious work of Providence to effect so holy an end The chiefs of the synaao ues were included among the converts and one can believe the statements current at the time that in Valencia alone the conversions amounted to eleven totu sand Moreover it was not only in the scenes of massacre that the good wxork went forward So startling and relentless was the slaumhter that panic replaced the unyieldinc fortitude which the Jews had so often displayed u nder trials equally severe In maniy places they did not wait for a rising of the Christians but at the first menace or even in anticipation of trouble they came eagerly forward and clamored to be received into the Church In Aragon the total number of conversions was reckoned at a hundred thou sand anid in Castile at as many more nor is this probably ati exaggeration1 Nowhere do ye hear of any atteimnpt at armed resistance The terrorstricken wretches either submittecd to slaughter or saved their lives by fliht or baptism In this tempest of conversion Ferrand Martinez yields the place to San Vicente Ferrer The former sowed the seed but the latter garnered the harvest and in fact it was to the fervor of his preaching that subsequently was attributed the excitement leading to the massacres2 This doubtless does him injustice as far as I

fatal July 9 may perhaps be an indi cation that he contributed to their continuance His eloquence was unrivalled  immense crowds assembled to drink in his words no matter what was the vernacular of the listener we are told that his Catalan speech was intelligible as was experienced by Moor Greek German Frenchman Italian and Hungarian while the virtue wlvich flowed from him on these occasions liealed the infirm and he repeatedly restored the dead to life1 Such was the man who during the prolonged massacres and subsequently while the terror which they excited continued to oppress the unfortunate race traversed Spain from enid to end with restless and indefati gable zeal preaching baptizingy and numbering his converts by the thiousand On a single day in Toledo he is said to have con verted no less than four thousand It is to be hoped that in some cases at least he may have restrained the pious zeal of the tnur derous mob if only by hiding its victims in the baptismal font That hiis methods however did not commend themselves to those who desired peace would appear from the story that when he wished subsequently to carry on his work in Portural and applied to Joai I for permission to enter his dominions the monarch replied that he could come but only on condition of wearing upon his head a redhot iron crown  an offer which he wisely declined2 Whatever may have been San Vicentes share in prolonging the massacres there can be no doubt that their commencement is attributalble to Ferrand Martinez who therefore is entitled to be bracketed with Cardinal Ximenez as the two Spaniards wlho have contributed most largely to the downfall of their countrys pros perity and power In the horror excited throughout the civilized world by the atrocities committed on the Armenians it is perhaps wholesome for us to be reminded that Christian fanaticism has been capable of still greater enormities and that even in the nineteenth century a cultured scholar like

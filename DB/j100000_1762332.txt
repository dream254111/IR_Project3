articles such as steel and iron shingles for roofing builders hardware artistic ironwork furniture springs polished parts of steam engines and other machinery boilertubes nuts and bolts water meters steamradiators and similar easily handled articles but the intention is to apply the process on a larger scale to archi tectural and structural iron and steel telegraph wire and probably to iron and steel plates for boiler construction ship building and similar uses As described by Professor Haupt and Dr Gesner this process does not produce a magnetic oxide upon the surface of the metal as is the case in other processes for making iron rustproof nor does it alter the dimensions of the articles treated It changes the body of the surface of the metal into a compound of hydrogen iron and carbon which is designated a double carbide of hy drogen and iron as determined by analysis Being an integral part of the metal it cannot scale or peel off and it prevents in definitely the rusting of the metal through exposure to the VOL XV No 365 necessary to reproduce here it being sufficient to summarize the results as given in the report The pieces were gauged both before and after treatment and showed no change The tests show practically no effect whatever upon the iron with the ex ception of a slight decrease in the elongation As the area is not reduced it would be impossible without further evidence to say whether or no the ductility were affected At any rate the duc tility being so low this small reduction if proved to exist would be of comparative unimportance in affecting the value of the metal The steel is benefited The annealing undergone during the treatment has softened it to some extent It has lost about five per cent in strength but gained five per cent in elon gation This metal as originally would not have come up to specifications being insufficient in stretch The treatment has not reduced the tensile strength below the assigned limit at the same time it has brought the elongation up to requirements Pieces of both iron and steel were bent cold to an angle of forty five degrees without showing any fracture or scaling of the treated surface  THE STOREY ELECTRIC MINING LOCOMOTIVE weather steam damp earth etc It is also found that cast iron is to some extent annealed in the process and its pores filled so that thin castiron pipe which before treatment would leak at five pounds pressure per square inch will stand a pres sure of fifty pounds without leakage after undergoing the pro cess It also improves the quality of steel The following is the report of Barton H Coffey ME of the Henry Warden Iron Works Philadelphia on the results of tests to determine the effect of the hydrogen tieatment on the physical properties of iron and steel  These tests were determined pon to decide if the hydrogen anticorrosive treatment had any adverse effect and if so to what extent upon the strength anO esilience of wrought iron and steel suitable for boiler ship and bridge purposes Five test pieces of iron were cut from a single plate onehalf inch thick and five more similarly from a threeeighth inch steel plate These were machined to suitable sizes for the standard eightinch testpiece giving a sectionof about 71 of a square inch for the iron and 51 of a square inch for the steel Three of each of these sets were forwarded to Dr Gesner for treatment who retained one and returned the remainder The tests were made with a 200000pound Olsen machine and the measurements with Brown  Sharpe micrometer gauges and are believed to be accurate  The results were recorded upon testblanks which it is un In conclusion the report says The hydrogen process does not affect the value of iron and steel for engineering purposes The treatment benefits steel by the annealing undergone in the pro cess The treated surface possesses elastic properties of the highest value ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVE FOR METAL MINES WE show in another part of this issue a view of a new electric rotary diamond drill manufactured by the Sprague Electric Railway and Motor Company of New York which has shown gratifying results in the tests to which it has been put and which promises to fulfil a longfelt want in electric mining On this page we show another special electric mining application ie an electric locomotive This locomotive is simple powerful and compact and is built with special reference to the rough usage and arduous duties required of such a machine The gauge of the accompanying locomotive is eighteen inches but it can be accommodated to any gauge in ordinary commercial work In order to protect the machine from damage all the working parts are completely boxed in as shown in the view The speed of the motor is under complete control by a switch which throws the winding of the field intoSCIENCE different electrical combinations thus varying the speed of the motor without the use of any wasteful resistance The direc tion of rotation is also governed by the same switch so that the operation of the motor is very simple and it can be put in charge of an ordinary workman Any system of conveying the current from the dynamo to the locomotive can be used either using the rails as one side of the circuit for the return of the current or else employing a com plete metallic circuit by the use of a double overhead trolley wire In this latter case a trolley pole shown in the view carrying at its upper end two trolley wheels for making run ning contact with the overhead wires is attached on the rear of the locomotive car This mining locomotive is now being manufactured by the Sprague Electric Railway and Motor Company from designs made by Mr I E Storey One of the most noticeable advances made in modern mining science is the adoption of electricity as a medium for transmitting power and producing light and 69 the same wires which supply current to the drill and when in such use are connected in multiple arc across the main current wires These drills are manufactured and sold by the Sprague Electric Railway and Motor Company of New York under patents granted to Mr I E Storey We understand that the Sprague Company is now at work on and will soon be able to furnish a number of special mining applications among which is an electric percussion drill THE LATEST THEORIES ON THE ORIGIN OF THE ENGLISH1 WHEN one is sometimes tempted to ask in sheer weariness will any man be able to say the last word on that question of the West which bids fair to be as eternal as any question of the East  the question whether we the English people are our selves or somebody else That formula is not a new one ELECTRIC MINING DRILL such applications as the above indicate the growing demand of mining companies for just such apparatus and the ability of the leading electric companies to supply the need ELECTRIC ROTARY DIAMOND DRILL THE accompanying view shows a new electric mining rotary 4drill which has shown good results in experimental work and which will soon be applied to regular miningwork in several leacing mines A good electric mining drill has always been desired by miners and this drill seems to meet all the requirements It is light compact simple and easy to operate The motor is completely incased so that it is impossible for dust dirt or stray stones to lodge in the working parts The whole drill is mounted on an adjustable frame so that it can be very easily set in any position desired or set at work at any part of the mine The current for operating the drill is supplied at a constant voltage or potential the number of volts depending on the potential used for transmitting power throughout the mine If lamps are needed they can be supplied with current from Some of us have in season and out of season through evil report and good report been fighting out that question for not a few years If it is wearisome to have to fight it out still there is some little relief in having to fight it out in a wholly new shape and with a wholly new set of adversaries It is an experience which has aft least the charm of novelty when we have to argue the old question who are we whence we came from a point of view which ight make it possible with the exercise of a little ingenuity avoid ever using the words Celt Briton or Romani at all On the other hand the strife in its new form has become more deadly the assault has become more threatening Hitherto we have fought for victory for dominion for what if one adopted the highpolite style of a lord mayors feast one might call the imperial instincts of the AngloSaxon race We have hadto fight to prove our greatness against people who told us that we were not so great as we thought Angles and Saxons we were told were only one element perhaps a very inferior element in the population of Britain Still nobody denied that we had some place in the world some place in this island It might be a very small place compared with that of the

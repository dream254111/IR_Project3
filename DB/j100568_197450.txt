application of the terms youth  maturity and old age to the progressive stages in the development of topographic forms has proved so helpful to a proper appreciation of the significance of many of these forms that all students of physiography are justly grateful for their introduction into physiographic terminology In discussing the use of these terms with classes making a study of topography I have found certain misapprehensions apt to arise unless specially guarded against It seems to me important to emphasize the fact that the terms in question are used by physiographers to indicate certain stages of development rather than degrees of age as measured by the lapse of time Because in the case of man stages of development termed youth maturity and old age are usually characteristic of certain periods of years we attach considerable importance to the time element in the interpretation of the terms That there is a difference between stage and age is apparent when we say that  some children mature while yet quite young or that  a man ages rapidly If this difference in the possible interpretations of the terms youth maturity and old age is brought clearly to the attention of the student and he is made to see that the terms as used in physiography refer to stages rather than to age he will have no difficulty in recognizing that a stream may be young where it cuts across a band of hard rock and mature both above and below where the rocks are soft notwithstand ing the fact that all of the parts of the stream in question may have existed for the same length of time This distinction has of course been made by those who have used the terms to such good advantage in the past but seems to require special emphasis when brought before the student for the first time In a paper on  The Geological Dates of Origin of Certain Topo graphic Forms on the Atlantic Slope of the United States  Pro fessor Davis makes clear the meaning of  age terms when used in a geographic sense He says When topographic forms are thus described age is not to be taken as a measure of time but only as indicating the degree of development of the region concerned a mushroom may grow old

nearly to baselevelthat is to a nearly featureless peneplainwhile in another part of the world a very hard mass in a dry climate might scarcely lose its constructional form in the same time One would have become old in the same measure of absolute time as that marking the youth of the other The two might have the same geological date of beginning but one would become geographically old while the other was still geographically young Some difficulties have arisen as a result of the application of the terms youth maturity and old age to the general topography of a region rather than to the individual features which go to make up that general topography Remembering that these terms are applied C  IOlaa CiI   X hsh c FIG IYOUNG STREAMS IN YOUNG PLAIN LASALLE QUADRANGLE ILLINOIS SCALE ABOUT I MILE TO THE INCH CONTOUR INTERVAL IO FEET to stages in the development of topographic features and that dif ferent topographic features have totally different methods of devel oping it will appear that confusion might easily arise if we try to classify a region characterized by diverse features as young mature or old For example the development of a river from youth to maturity is characterized by the establishing of a graded course the retreat of the valley walls the formation of a floodplain the acquiring of meanders etc the development of a plateau from youth to matur650 Youth Maturity and Old Age of Topographic Forms ity is marked by the progressive dissection of the plateau more and more of the plateau surface being lost as the branching streams remove the rock until that surface is nearly or quite destroyed Now it is conceivable that a large volume of water flowing across a newlyelevated plain or plateau might develop a mature valley before the plain or plateau on either side had suffered any marked dissection We would then have a mature stream valley cut in a young plain or plateau To speak of such a case as an example of either youthful or mature topography without further designation would hardly be correct On the other hand it is possible for a plateau region to be thor oughly dissected by an intricate network of streams the streams having steepsided narrow valleys but having branched so exten sively that the former level surface of the plateau is nearly or quite destroyed We would then have youthful stream valleys in a mature plateau Such a region has been called a region in maturity From the standpoint of the plateau this would be correct but from the standpoint of the stream valleys the region is one of youth Unless the beginner has some other means of knowing what is referred to the statement that such a map represents a region in youth or ma turity might cause no little misunderstanding It is necessary clearly to understand that the entire topography of a region need not develop uniformly from youth to maturity and old age but that the various elements of that topography may have different modes and rates of development For the sake of clearness it seems better to recognize the various elements of a complex topography separately even where they happen to be in the same general stage of their several develop metts It is interesting to compare the extreme youth of a river with its extreme old age It would seem that we are less familiar with types of these two stages of stream development than we are with the inter mediate types The first stage is so exceedingly short that we do not find many streams in that stage at any given time The old age of a stream is so exceedingly long that before a stream can become well advanced in that stage some interruptional force such as crustaI elevation intervenes to change the whole process of development or start a new cycle The conditions under which streams may have their beginning are so diverse that it is unsafe to assume any one type of extreme youth as normal regarding other types as abnormal If water finds itself compelled to flow down the irregular hummocky surface of morainal topography the first stages in the development of streamsYouth Maturity and Old Age of Topographic Forms 651 in that region will be marked by features quite different from those characterizing the first stages of stream development where water finds itself flowing down the even slope of a coastal plain but in each case the features may be perfectly normal for the region in question As a rule some of the water which traverses landforms for the first time has been collected into definite streams on adjoining FIG 2YOUNG STREAMS IN MATURE PLATEAU CHARLESTON QUADRANGLE WEST VIRGINIA SCALE ABOUT 2 MILES TO THE INCH CONTOUR INTERVAL 100 FEET preexisting regions and so finds its way across the new region in a concentrated amount from the very first The features normal to the streams developing under these conditions may be different from those normal to streams formed wholly by the runoff of the new region alone Thus the streams which flow from the  old land area out

2 MILES TO THE INCH CONTOUR INTERVAL 20 FEET from the same stage of a similar stream which flows out across the nearly level surface of a lake plain In the latter case the conditions approach those existing on the floodplain of a mature river There being no definite slope of a marked degree and the material of the lake plain being more or less fine and homogeneous the stream is readily deflected by trifling obstacles and acquires good meandersYouth Maturity and Old Age of Topographic Forms 653 It is thus seen that one of the features most frequently observed in mature or old streams may characterize the earliest stages of youth in a stream formed under certain conditions Judging from available maps and reports the Red River near Fargo North Dakota affords a good example of this type of topography It can hardly be regarded as an abnormal type but is rather to be considered as one among a number of different types of youth all of which are equally normal under their respective conditions of development MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY THE FIFTEENTH GERMAN GEOGRAPHICAL CONGRESS IN DANZIG BY DR AUGUST WOLKENHAUER Assistant in the Geographical Department in the University of G6ttingen The German Geographical Congress founded in I88I by the well known African explorer Nachtigal held its fiftieth meeting during Whitsuntide week in the old and honoured trade town of Danzig which with its historical buildings and characteristic environs must have delighted all the visiting geographers The local authorities made excellent arrangements for the Congress which will rank worthily with the meetings held at Breslau in I90I and at Cologne in I903 The Fifteenth Congress was particularly interesting because almost all the members of the German South Polar Expedition were present to give their official account of the results of their journey It will be remembered that the return of the German Expedition to Africa was telegraphed to the Congress at Cologne Five scientific sessions were held with a special topic for each meeting The first session on Tuesday morning was devoted to the German South Polar Expedition Professor von Drygalski of Ber lin the leader of the party gave a general account of the enterprise As is well known the German Geographical Congress under the leadership of Neumayer until recently director of the German Naval Observatory in Hamburg had worked for twenty years to bring about a renewal of Antarctic exploration At the Geographical Congress held in Bremen I895 the movement began to take shape The German Reichstag later granted means for the building of the

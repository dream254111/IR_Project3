j100168,Harvard Law Review,1322585,The Dreyfus Case,i256865,THE DREYFUS CASE Alfred Dreyfus a Jew captain of the French artillery in December 1894 was conivicted of a charge of treason by a courtmartial proceedings of which were not made public Subsequently it has appeared that the conviction was largely based on the belief that Dreyfus was the author of the bordereae a document extracted from a wastebasket of a foreign embassy supposed to be in his handwriting It announced the transmission of military information to the foreign government is agreed to be autlhentic and is clearly treasonable It is understood that certain other documentary evidence to be noted later reinforced the belief in his guilt In January I898 the Dreyfusites brouglht to public trial Commandant Esterhazy this again a military courtmiiartial on a charge of having written the  bordereau One of the main points of the Dreyfusites was the similarity of Esterhaizys handwritinig to that of the  bordereau The theory of the defence was that it was written by Dreyfus but that in attempting to avert suspicion he had imitated Esterhazys hand a curious inconsistency in the light of the line of proof which brought about the conviction of Dreyfus for the bordereau was then it seems supposed to have been written by Dreyfus in his own hand The court refused to allow the prosecution to give evidence or to make any reference to the Dreyfus trial to contradict that verdict declaring it chose uge Naturally Esterhazy was acquitted The conduct of the trial showed pretty clearly that the result was rendered under order and the only point scored by the Dreyfusites was in showing  conclusively  that Esterhazy was a thorouighgoing rascal In 1898 Emile Zola received tlhree trials and a final conviction in an action for libel for impeaching the justice of the Esterhazy courtmartial See ii HARVARD LAW REVIEW 539 These trials were important largely in that they brought to light certain portions of the evidence on which Dreyfus was originally convicted  and the thinness of it By this time the aspect of affairs had greatly changed Through the efforts of one Colonel Picquart and the Dreyfuisites it became clear that it was strongly probable that a certain amount of the evidence against Dreyfus had been manufactured to reinforce the original verdict and again that this was done with the cogniizance of some members of the general staff of the French army In August 1898 Colonel Henry an ardent antiDreyfusite and through his official position as chief of the Secet Service Bureau succeeding Picquart most prominent in the series of trials committed suicide after arrest but before his death confessed to having forged certain proof of Dreyfuss guilt a document purporting to come from a foreign government referring to their connec tion with Dreyfus The document had been used though not shown in the first Zola trial Not until after this did Dreyfus obtain a retrial In the present year at the petition of the Minister of Justice the Court of Cassation thle supreme court of criminal appeal in France because of the presentation of new evidence reopened the Dreyfus case and finally decided on a new courtmiartial For a short description of the powers of the court ofNOTES 2 I 5 Cassation see Mr Richard Hales The Dreyfus Story page 23 The work of the Court of Cassation was not a retrial but practically an examination of the Dreyfus side of the caseits process was largely secret It is to be noted that in neither English nor American law is there a like provision for the reopening of a criminal case after verdict because of new evidence Texas seems the sole exception  there a court of criminal appeal may review the facts after verdict The retrial of Dreyfus began on August 8 I899 and continued until September 8th The trial  save four days which were occupied with the examination of docu ments was public The evidence as far as we know it given at that trial sums up to the ordinary reader something thus there had been a leakage ill the offices of the general staff by which important military informnation had gone to foreign nations It seems Dreyfus was rather a prying busybody not a very efficient officer There appeared no direct evidence connecting DreyfLis with any treasonable practice Certain methods of French procedure at that trial  as in the whole series of trials seem to the AngloSaxon absurdities The witnesses told their stories ideas and beliefs and lugged in extraneous matter as they pleased There was no efficient crossexamination allowed hearsay from unreliable sources mere gossip was constantly reported that no English or American court  even military  would receive the deposi tions of foreign attach6s who presLImably had knowledge of the affair were refused perhaps on sound political reasons a great part of the testimony was devoted to besmirching Dreyfuss personal character the generals of the army consistently bullied the minor officers who sat as judges and more than all these there was as there had been in all the trials a constant dwarfing of the prisoners right to a fuill hearing when it came or seemed to come in conflict with the political interests of the coulntry and the French army That is for us the amazing aspect of the case That the rights of the individual must yield before the necessities of state is a fundamental proposition of the French law on it the sole system of socalled administration law of continental countries rests Perlhaps we AngloSaxons cannot understand that principle or the extent to which it should be carried but it seems impossible to get away from the conclu sioIi that it was flagrantly misused to convict a man against whom there were insufficient proofs Under such conditions Dreyfus was found guilty of treason with extenuating circumstances to be immediately pardoned hv President Lonhet

woodwork trimmings of doors windows and cases are of oak The frame work of the building is of steel construction The staircases are of iron with treads of Tennessee marble The hallways are tiled up to seven feet from the floor with 8 x 6 white tile the baseboard being of Tennessee marble The windows are very large and the glazing is of plate glass First FloorAssay Laboratory 54 x 52 ft This laboratory furnishes desk accommodation and furnace room for seventyfour students at once which is the largest fireroom accommo634 SCIENCE N S VOL XXV No 642 dation in the country The furnaces consist of eighteen large muffles for scarification and cupellation and fourteen pot furnaces for crucible work Each furnace has a separate flue The students desks are topped with an inch and a half slab of Alberene stone and each contains drawers for the accommodation of apparatus The supporting legs are of iron Water is supplied at the ends of the rows of desks where are situated sinks of Alberene stone The other furniture of the laboratory consists of anvil blocks tables for bucking plates orecrushers and racks for cooling crucibles Quantitative Laboratory 44 x 16 ft This laboratory has accommodations for twenty stu dents at a time in quantitative analysis It is excellently lighted The students desks are topped with Alberene stone supported upon iron supports and containing four drawers for apparatus with storage room below each desk for larger pieces The large hood accommo dation is provided with hot plates and water bath the hoods being made of angle iron painted with aluminum paint and are glazed with corrugated glass Water is supplied in sinks of solid porcelain Gas air blast and suction are also at hand A special weighing room 7 x 16 ft opens off this laboratory where the balances are supported on Alberene stone bracketed to a brick wall of especially heavy construction Next to this balance room is a second balance room similarly fitted up and containing the assay balances for the students in the assay laboratory Instructors Room 19 x 13 This room opens both into the assay laboratory and into the quantitative laboratory and is fitted with hood water blast suction and the other requi sites for a complete private laboratory for the instructor in that department It is also ar ranged to accommodate the supplies of ma terials issued to students as examination topics in both the courses over which it has control The Stock Rooms are four in number 9x16 12x26 9x16 5x16 and are fitted with appropriate shelving to accommodate the chemicals and apparatus required for general laboratory purposes The Sulphuretted Hydrogen Room 8 x 6 is ventilated by special device directly into the open air and contains the sulphuretted hydrogen apparatus from which the gas is piped to the thirtysix outlets in the main qualitative laboratory on the floor above The gas is delivered under a pressure of about ten inches of water Fuel Bins 11x 8 for the coal and coke necessary for the assay laboratory are ar ranged so as to permit the fuel to be shot through coalholes in the roof which is on the level of the roadway above Second FloorMain Qualitative Labora tory 50x80 ft This room is lighted by large windows on four sides and by a skylight extending over half its area On each end are the hoods made of metal and glass eight in number and each 6 feet in length making a total hood accommodation of nearly 100 linear feet These hoods contain the hot plates and the steam baths for boiling and evapora tion and they also contain the thirtysix out lets wherefrom students can secure sulphur ettedhydrogen gas for purposes of precipita tion The steam baths are two in number with accommodations for fifty steam evapora tions at once the steam being admitted to chambers of Alberene stone directly from the steam pipes of the heating system Each hood has its own individual outlet flue for fumes The laboratory has accommodations for one hundred and thirty students at a time in qualitative analysis Students desks are topped with Alberene stone and are furnished with four drawers and two closets for appa ratus Water is supplied to each desk and the sinks are of solid porcelain Each stu dent is provided with forty reagents in glass bottles which are supported by shelves of plate glass resting upon metallic uprights The heating of this laboratory as of all other rooms in the building is furnished from the steam plant in the department of electrical engineering Radiators are everywhere placed under the windows and in addition to the heat so supplied a further quantity is furnished by the ventilation system Air is sucked in from the outside passed over heated steamAPRIL 19 1907 SCIENCE 635 coils and is then blown by an electric fan through ducts opening in the side walls of the laboratory Fumes pass Gut not only through the individual fume flues of the hoods but also through numerous flues opening a little below the ceiling along all the walls These flues have also openings near the floor so that either opening may be used as occasion de mands Spectroscope accommodations are furnished in the four corners of this labora tory One feature worthy of notice is the broad eightfoot aisles between the lines of desks This gives abundant room to every student Supply Room 6 x 16 This room is of two stories and is intended to be used for the issuing of reagents and as a storage room for smaller glass apparatus Instructors Room 12 x 16 Because of the great height of its ceiling this room has a gallery around two sides thus greatly in creasing the storage space for chemicals be cause of the increased wall space for shelving The distilledwater apparatus is here located and the supply of distilled water is here stored in a tinlined copper tank the water being tapped off therefrom to a spigot in the main laboratory The room is equipped with com plete apparatus suitable for a private labora tory Ward Room 10 x 16 Fitted with the usual accommodations for receiving hats and coats of the students Organic Combustion Room 8 x 16 This room is fitted with Alberene stone tables gas blast and suction and is arranged to receive the combustion train for the usual work in organic combustion Third FloorThe Lecture Room 50 x 41 ft 6 in has seating accommodations for two hundred men It contains the large lec ture table with pneumatic trough and the other essentials to fit it for lecture uses It is lighted by three small and six very large windows On the wall opposite the lecture table there projects a gallery intended to hold the electric lantern for illustration work This gallery is entered from the floor above Private Laboratory 16 x 24 This room is fitted as a private laboratory for the professor of chemistry and contains the usual comple ment of heeds water baths and other appli ances suitable to such use The Laboratory for Gas Analysis 11 x 16 contains Alberenestone table water gas and blast accommodations with suitable shelving to accommodate the apparatus for which the room is intended to be used The Special Laboratory 10 x 16 is fitted in the same manner as that of gas analysis and is intended to be used for such special work as the examination of food products etc Fourth FloorWater Laboratory 20 x 31 This laboratory is fitted with Alberenetopped tables and with water appliances suitable to the very complete examination of questions dealing with the examination of potable min eral and boiler waters Appliances are here established for undertaking such examinations from both the chemical and the bacteriological sides An especially devised table for the determination of free and albuminoid am monia permits of the analysis of six waters at once Suitable provision is made for the sterilizers incubators and other apparatus pe culiar to a water laboratory Section Room 20 x 20 This room is fitted with blackboards and is intended for use as a recitation room in chemistry It has accommodations for a section of about twenty five men at a time The HallsThe halls throughout the build ing are eight feet in width LightingThe building is piped for gas but it is as a precaution only inasmuch as electricity is to be depended upon for lighting purposes W P MASON

of carpenter work in our article of agreement of given date was held nonnegotiable Reynolds v Richards 14 Pa 205 And a note to pay a certain amount for value received in one machinery as per con tract of certain date was burdened with all defenses which could be set up to an action on the contract First National Bank of Richmond v Badlham 86 S C 170 68 S E 536 There is a contrary line of decisions which hold such a reference as that of the instant case to be a mere recital of consideration and hence it does not affect the negotiability of a note So a recital that this note is given in accordance with the terms of a certain contract under the same date and between the same parties did not destroy the negotiability of the note Markey v Corey 108 Mich 184 66 N W 493 36 L R A 117 62 Am St Rep 698 It seems that the latter is the better vew since it is the policy of the law to favor negotiable instruments For a discussion as to when an exten sion of time affects negotiability see 3 VA LAW REV 145 COMPROMISELIABILITY INSURANCEDECREASING THE AMOUNT INSURED AGAINSTThe plaintiff was insured by the defendant to the extent of 5000 against liability for accidents resulting from the operation of an automobile A party injured by the automobile brought an action of damages for 25000 A clause in the policy reserved to the insurer the right to defend such accidents or to settle on the best terms pos sible Before trial of the action for the injury the claimant through negotiations of the insurer agreed to accept 3150 in satisfaction of his claim The defendant advised the plaintiff that this was a reason able offer and that if the case proceeded to trial it might result in a judgment much larger than the amount covered by the policy but refused to agree to the proposed settlement unless the plaintiff would bear 750 of the loss In order to avoid the risk of a judgment in ex cess of the amount of his policy the plaintiff contributed the money towards the proposed settlement and then brought an action to re cover such amount from the defendant Held the plaintiff can not re cover Levin v New England Casualty Co 166 N Y Supp 1055 Although the facts in the instant case seem to present a question of first impression yet it seems that they should be governed by the principles applicable to compromises which are governed by the gen eral rules applicable to all contracts Armijo v Henry 14 N M 181 89 Pac 305 25 L R A N S 275 See 5 R C L 876 However the law favors such contracts as tending to prevent litigation Smith v Smith 36 Ga 184 91 Am Dec 761 While the controversy is fresh the parties themselves know more completely than any one else what jus tice requires at their hands Doyle v Donnelly 56 Me 26 The principal elements necessary to a valid compromise are the re ality of the claim made and the good faith of the settlement Trenton St Ry Co v Lawlor 74 N J Eq 828 71 Atl 234 While the adequacy of the consideration will not be inquired into the want of any consid eration whatever may be inquired into Creutz v Heil 89 Ky 429 12 S W 926 The holding in the instant case seems to be wholly dependent upon 285VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW the question of good faith The insurer undoubtedly had a right to have the case against the insured proceed to judgment and the sur render of this right might be held as a valid consideration for the money contributed by the insured On the other hand the insurer agreed to indemnify the insured up to the amount named in the policy but it stipulated for the option to compromise or defend actions against the insured in order to protect itself against unjust claims it therefore seems manifestly inequitable to allow the insurer to thus reduce its liability at the expense of the insuredto just that extent the efficacy of the policy is nullified It is ccnduct of this sort on the part of the insurer that has resulted in so much unwise legislation on the subject of insurance EVIDENCENEGLIGENCERES IPSA LOQUITURThe plaintiff purchased in the defendants restaurant a cake prepared baked and wrapped in waxpaper by the defendant While eating the cake the plaintiff bit tipon a nail concealed therein whereupon she brought an action against the defendant for the injuries resulting To sustain her action the plaintiff relied upon the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur Held the doc trine of res ipsa loquitur does not apply Jacobs v Childs Co 166 N Y Supp 798 The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur the thing itself speaks is an excep tion to the general rule that negligence is not to be inferred but must be affirmatively proved Johns v Petnnsylvania R Co 226 Pa 319 75 Atl 408 28 L R A N S 591 This maxim is founded upon the principle that evidence of an injury which may only be palliated or explained by facts within the peculiar knowledge of the perpetrator carries with it proof of its wrongful character and places upon the perpetrator the burden of offering a just excuse Thompson v St Louis Southwestern Ry Co 243 Mo 336 148 S W 484 See WIGMORE EVI DENCE  2509 In a Georgia case a person who was injured by swallowing bits of glass contained in a bottle of beverage was allowed to recover by merely showing the presence of the bits of glass While the court did not mention the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur it evidently applied that principle Watson v Augusta Brewing Co 124 Ga 121 52 S E 152 110 Am St Rep 157 1 L R A N S 1178 And in a New York case a woman was allowed to recover for injuries received from a nee dle by merely showing its presence in an unfinished seam of a dress Garvey v Natmm 36 App Div 815 121 N Y Supp 442 In these cases however the substance causing injury was used in the production of the finished article in which it was found and the natural presumption would be that it was left there through the negligence of the defend ant It has been contended that an entirely foreign substance should not so readily be presumed to have found its way into the article through the defendants negligence Authority on the precise point involved in the instant case is scant This case purports to follow Hasbrouck v Armour  Co 139 Wis 357 121 N W 157 23 L R A N S 876 but aside from this case there seems to be no authority for the doctrine here laid down 286

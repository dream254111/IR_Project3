J100438,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY,1004871,AN ACCOUNT OF SOME OF THE PRINCIPAL DIES EMPLOYED BY THE NORTHAMERICAN INDIANS EXTRACTED FROM A PAPER COMMUNICATED BY THE LATE MR HUGH MARTIN,I241955,NT XXVI AN ACCOUNT OF FOME OF THEPRINCIPAL DIES EMPLOYED BY THE NORTHARNTERICAN INDIANS EXTRADED FROM A PAPER BY THE LATE MR HUGH MARTIN READ O H E INDIANS DIE THEISR RED WITH A FLENDER ROOT 4TH I782A WHICH IS CALLED IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE SHAW ANOES ZAU TA THE CAUGH UPON MY FIHOWING A FPECI MENI N D I A N D I E S 223 MEN OF THIS ROOT TO THE DIERS IN PHILADELPHIA THEY INFORM ED ME THAT IT WAS MADDER AND THAT BY TRANFPLANTING AND CULTIVATING IT FOR A FEW YEARS IT WOULD BECOME EXAALY ILINILAR TO THE IMPORTED MADDER OF THE FHOPS IN ITS NATURAL FLATE IT GROWS IN LOW FWAMPY GROUNDS AND FPREADS ALONGR THE GROUND NEAR THE FURFACE THE ROOTS ARE OF VARIOUS LENGTHS FOINE OF THEM BEING NOT MORE THAN AN INCH OR TWO WHILIF OTHERS ARE TWO FEET LONG THEIR THICKNEFS FELDOOM EXCEEDS THAT OF A FIRAW THEFE ROOTS WHEN FREFHF FOR THE MOFT PART PUT ON AN ORANGE APPEARANCE THOUGH FOME OF THEM ARE YELLOW BUT AFTER THEY ARE DRIED WHICH THEY MUFT BE BEFORE TTHEY CAN BE UFED WITH FUCCEFS THE OUTFIDE APPEARS OF A DARK BROWN WHEN BROKEN HOWEVER THE INFIDE APPEARS RED FRONI EVERY ROOT ARIFES ONE LIMBER FTALK WHICH IS COMMONLY FROIN FIX TO EIGHTEEN INCHES LHIGH AT THE DIFLANCE OF ABOUT HALF AN INCH THERE ARE FOUR FMALL LEAVES AND ON THE TOP IS THE FEEDVEFFEL WHICH COMES TO MATURITY IN SEPTEMBER AND IS OF A CONIC FORIN IN FOME FWAMPY FITUATIONS I HAVE FOUND THIS VEGETABLE GROWING FO PLENTIFULLY THAT FEVERAL HANDL FULLS OF IT MIGHT HAVE BEENI GATHERED WITHIN THE COMPAFS OF A YARD OR TWO THE INDIANS POUND THE ROOTS OF THE HAU TA THE CATUGH IN A MORTAR WITH THE ADDITION OF THE ACID JUICE OBTAINED FROM THE CRABAPNLE THEY THEN THROW THE WHOLE INTO A KETTLE OF WATER ALONG WITH THE FUBFLANCE TO BE DIED AND PLACE THE VEFLEL OVER A GENTLE FIRE UNTIL THE COLOUR IS PRO PERLY FIXED IT IS LY THIS PROCEFS THAT THE INDIANS DIE THE WLHITE HAIR OF DEERTAILS AND THE PORCUPINEQUILLS WITH WHIICH THEY OR NAMENT TLHEMFELVES OF A RED COLOUR I HAVE ALFO FEEN A FPECIMEN OF WROOL WHICH ONE OF THEM HAD DIED OF A BEAU TIFUL RED IN THE FARNE MANNER I MADE EXPERIMENTS WITH THIS RED AND THE VEGETABLEACID AND FUCCEEDED I ALFO EM PLOYED224 AN ACCOUNT OR SOME PLOYED THE VITRIOLICACID INDALUM C WHICH MADE IT OF A DARKER COLOUR THE ORANGE VOLOUR EMPLOYED BY THE INDIANS IS OBTAINN ED FROM THE ROOT OF THE POCCON THE OUTFIDE BEING PARED OF AND ALFO FROM THE PLANT CALLED 7OUCHMENOT THE VEGE TABLEACID BEFORE MENTIONED IS LIKEWIFE UFED AS A FIXER TO THE COLOUR OF THEFE TWO PLANTS I FOUND THAT BY MIXING THE RED COLOUR OF THE RLAU TA THE CAUGH WITH THE YELLOW COL OUR OF THE PLANT OF WHICH I AM NEXT TO FPEAK I MADE AN ORANGE THE INDIANS DIE THEIR BRIGHTYELLOW WITH THE ROOT OF A PLANT WHICH GROWS FPONTANEOUFLY IN THE WEFLERN WOODS AND WHICH MIGHT VERY PROPERLY BE CALLED RADIX FLAVA AMNERT CANA THIS ROOT IS GENERALLY FROM ONE TO THREE INCHES LONG AND ABOUT ONE HALF OF AN INCH IN DIAMETER AND FENDS OUT A GREAT NUMBER OF FMALL FILAMENTS IN EVERY DIREATION EXCEPT UPWARDS  THEFE FILAMENTS ARE AS YELLOW AS THIE BODY OF THE ROOT ITFELF FROM THE ROOT THERE GROWS UP A FLALK ABOUTA FOOT FROM THE GROUND AND AT THE TOP IS ONE BROAD LEAF A RED BERRY IN FHAPE AND FIE REFEMBLING A RAFPBERRY BUT OF A DEEPER RED GROWS ON THE TOP OF THE LEAF THIS BERRY IS RIPE IN JULY I MADE FOME EXPERIMENTS WITH THISROOT AND THE VEGE TABLEACID ON FILK LINNEN AND WOOLEN AND FUCCEEDED I TRIED IT AGAIN WITH THE VITRIOLICACID AND LIKEWIFE FUCCEEDED I ALFO TRIED IL WITH THE VEGETABLEALKALI AND WITHOUT ANY OF THEFE FUBFLANCES AND WAZ LUCCEFSFUL IN OBTAINING A GOOD YELLOW IN ITS FIMPLE FLATE I PREFENTED A FPECIMEN OF THIS ROOT TO THE DIERS WHO FOUND IT TO BE A VALUABLE ARTICLE IN MAKING A YELLOW AND WITH THE ADDITION OF INDIGO IN MAK ING A GREEN THEIR GREEN IS MADE BY BOILING VARIOUS BLUE FUBFLANCES IN THE LIQUOR OF SMOOTHHICKERY BARK WHICH DIES A YELLOW IN THIS MANNER I HAVE FEEN BLUE CLOTH AND YARN CHANG EDT N D A N D I E S 223 ED TO A GREEN BUT THE GOODNEFS OF THE GREEN DEPENDED ON THAT OF THE BLUE THERE ARE OTHER FUBILANCES WHICH DIE A YELLOW COLOUR AND WITH WHICH THE INDIGO WILL FORM A GREEN BUT AS THEY ARE FOUND TO BE INFERIOR TO THE RADIX FLAVA OR YELLOWROOT IN MAKING A YELLOW AND WITH THE INDIGO A GREEN NOTHING NEED BE FAID OF THEM IN MAKING THEIR GREEN THE INDIANS DIFCOVER GREAT CCO NOMY THEY CAREFUILLY UNRAVEL FMALL PIECES OF GREEN CLOTH AND PIECES OF OLD GREEN GARMENTS THEFE THEY THROW IN TO A KETTLE WITH A FUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF WATER AND THE CLOTH TO BE DIED THE WHOLE IS THEN FET OVER A GENTLE FIRE UN TIL THE COLOUR IS MADE THEY INFORMED ME THAT BY THIS PROCEFS THEY DIE THEIR PORCUPINEQUILLS GREEN THE BLUES ARE FO WELL KNOWN TO BE MADE BY THE INDIGO OF OUR OWN CONTINENT THAT NOTHING NEED BE FAID CONCERN ING THEM HERE UTNDER THIS HEAD HOWEVER T BEG LEAVE TO OBFERVE THAT THE WOAD IS THE NATURAL PRODUCE OF OUR WEILERN FOIL AND THAT WITHOUT IT NO DEEP OR LAFTING BLUE CAN BE MADE THE INDIATNS DIE THEIR BLACK WITH THE SUMACH OF THIS COUNTRY THEY LIKEWIFE MAKE A BEAUTIFUL BLACK WITH THE BARK OF THE WHITEWALNUT AND THE VEGETABLEACID FOR THEY HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE MINERAL ACIDS WITH THIS BARK I HAVE FEEN THEM DIE THEIR WOOLEN CLOTHS AND THE INTEFTI RIES OF VARIOUS IPECIES OF ANIMALS AT BEARS C VOL III I F NO XXI

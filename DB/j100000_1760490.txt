we have taken no account of the present and future trade of the Atlantic ports of South America and the An tilles with all parts of the Pacific which cannot be reckoned at less than half a million tons Neither have we attempted to estimate the in crease of European and North American tonnage which must result from the impetus given to the trade with the Pacific and Oceania and which probably would not amount to less than an addi tional one or two million tons The aggregate tonnage therefore that will an nually pass through the canal must be reckoned at about eleven or twelve million tons The cost of the canal is estimated at about 50000000 and the interest due annually to share and bondhold ers amounts to 8000000 FERDINAND DE LESSEPS A PLEA FOR THE SENSE OF SMELL THE division of the five senses into higher and lower has carried with it both a moral and an aesthetic implication While it is granted as a general proposition that sight and hearing have been the aesthetic educators of our race yet at various times have attempts been made to rescue one or other of the remaining senses from the aesthetic degradation to which they were con signed The aesthetic value of the tactilemater group of sensations is deduced from the educa bility of the blind as regards artistic conceptions That taste and smell play a real and worthy role in aesthetic life is the claim of every epicure The very word which we use to denote artistic appreciation taste owes its origin to this class of sensations A recent writer 1 in this field urges the claim that the sense of taste has no right to the aesthetic position it occupies and that it has usurped the place that of right belongs to smell The question discussed is that of the  gastronomic value of odors The point of view can be most briefly described as epicurean The thesis is that the pleasures of the table usually assigned as  matters of taste  are really  matters of smell Taste and smell have all along acted in such close association  have so to speak gone to the same school learned the same lessons enjoyed the same pleasures and suffered the same pains that they have almost come to be regarded as one sense only by special artificial means do we fully realize their dual nature That a blindfolded person clasping his nose tightly will not be able I Henry T Finukq Contemporary review November I WE 3VOL VIII No 200 to distinguish between beef mutton veal or pork will be similarly confused by bits of chicken turkey and duck etc is a familiar experience Apart from the different kinds of feeling which these foodstuffs produce in the mouth they are distinguished by smell alone Hence to get the real pleasure of eating one must smell the food True society discountenances this proceeding if done in the ordinary way but says Mr Fincks there is a second way of smelling not usually recognized except unconsciously by gastronomists viz by exhaling through the nose In ordinary expiration the air does not touch the olfactory region of the nostril but by a special effort the air laden with all the perfumes that make up the epicures paradise can be turned into that direc tion On this depends the art of eating There are great individual differences in the power of accomplishing this result and perhaps colorblind ness has its analogy in smell On the other hand gastronomic practice for smell is as essential as artistic training for color In both cases the teaching is largely unconscious and instinct points out the best method of enjoying food The mistake is that we call every mouthsensation a taste and do not analyze it physiologically Taste is a very meagre sense at best we dis tinguish six kinds  alkaline metallic bitter sour sweet and saline The first two have no gastronomic value salt is at best  that which spoils the soup if it isnt put in and is not relished for its own sake while a taste for bitter is a morbid craving for contrast at which the unsophisticated tongue of children would revolt Even sour and sweet must be allied with fra grance to yield much pleasure What we call sour is usually a combination of tastes smells and touches We distinguish one sour from another by the accompanying odor Sweetness is the only original and genuine pleasure of the overrated sense of taste Yet even here the pleasure would be small if smell did not aid  Were taste alone to be considered confectioners might as well close their shops and leave the sale of sugar to grocers No one cares much for plain sugar even children soon learn to prefer candy ie flavored sugar I A few gifted mortals known as epicures have had an instinctive knowledge of the importance of odors and the same is true of a few original and immortal cooks The two main obstacles to the recognition of the gastronomic reform em bodied in the principle that the object of cookery is to develop the  countless delicious perfumes latent in the raw material of food or to add others when the food is deficient in natural fla vor are the amazing gastronomic indifferenceDECEMBER 3 1886 SCIEi of mankind  and the notion that there is some thing unrefined in the undisguised enjoyment of a meal The cure for the first is a right educa tion the second is a relic of asceticism shown at its worst in the superstition that it is exquisitely refined and feminine for a girl to have no appe tite Epicures are healthy because they live on the quintessence of food by constantly breathing through the nose The epicures habit of retain ing this pleasure as long as possible leads to slow eating and complete mastication Odors stimu late the flow of saliva and the other alimentary juices and thus a gastronomist will never be a dyspeptic Epicureanism is not gluttony it is the ability to get pleasure out of commonplace foods He may prefer canvasback duck to roast goose but he alone knows what an oriental rosegarden of magic perfumes may be found in the simplest crust of wholemeal or grahaml bread and butter In this strain Mr Fincks develops the science of eating and of cooking and applies its principles to several important classes of foodstuffs He even proposes a new industry namely of so feeding poultry and other animals as to produce a special brand of meat with original nuances of flavor And finally he promises us that the rec ognition of the royal position of smell in the gas tronomic hierarchy would bring about an increase of twenty per cent or more in the average health and happiness of the community The notorious Jaeger holds that the soul is a smell we have now been given reasons for be lieving that smell is at the least the breath of life J J A RECENT CONTRIBUTION TO THE DIS CUSSION OF HYPNOTISM THE French psychologists seem to be making their own the study of whole groups of mental phenomena Of late years almost all the valua ble contributions to the subject of hypnotism and all phenomena have come from them In fact they have discovered so many new and striking facts that almost all the old generalizations have been overthrown and the multiplicity of facts has hardly as yet been digested into any new theory One of the most interesting of recent dis cussions is that of Burgson in the November num ber of the Revue philosophique It is valuable not only for the new light thrown upon some of the most mysterious phenomena of hypnotism but for the suggestions which it offers to a study of the whole complex field of thoughttransfer rence From time to time there have been reports of hypnotic persons who could see through opaque WVCE 521 objects tell what was going on at a distance etc The case of some boys who could tell the title of the chapter at the head of a page or the number of the page when a book was opened but was held with its cover towards them was reported to Burgson Upon trying it he found that one of the boys told correctly at least every other time what was required Some experimenters would have stopped short with this and would have heralded abroad a remarkable case of telepathic action But Burgson continued experimenting He noticed three things When the hypnotized subject was asked how he knew for example the figures of a page he replied that he saw them and when he was asked to touch the back of the book instead of touching the cover he put his hand under and touched the open page Another fact was that when the boy did not guess right the first time he would often correct it if the book were moved a few inches nearer or farther from the eye of the operator The third thing was that the figures were often read reversed as 213 for 312 This suggested to the operator that the patient seemed to be reading as if in a nmirror and he began to wonder if it were possible that the latter read the figures or word as reflected in the cornea of himself the operator Simple ex periments revealed that if the operators eyes were closed as soon as the figure had been seen the patient was rarely successful that the atti tude which gave the best chance for the forma tion of a distinct image was that in which the guess was most uniformly successful and that the correctness of the guess decreased as the light was changed so as to obscure the reflection The image in the cornea could not be however more than 1 mm in size In spite of the wellattested hyperaesthesia of organs in hypnotic subjects there might be some doubt of an ability to see any thing so small Experiments were then tried with a view to deciding this point The most satisfactory consisted in giving the subject a pre pared section of an orchid the cells of whose tissue were only 06 mm in diameter and telling him to draw the same With microscopic fineness of vision this was done It only remained to see if the hypnotic patients power of forming conclusions from very subtle and ordinarily imperceptible signs was confined to corneareading It was easily proved that it was not The operator hypnotized the subject sitting before him and then made the latter be lieve that he was one with the operator so that whatever affected him would also affect the sub ject Then a third person standing behind the operator pricked some part of the latter gener ally a part of his hand held behind his back The

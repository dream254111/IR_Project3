stream The general trend of modern legislation is towards the latter course no doubt due largely to the influ ence of the increasing number of State Boards of Health but why not make it a question of municipal economy If Newark for example wants her water supply from the Passaic river whose waters are polluted does it not seem absurd speak ing broadly that she should be required to purify her supply of twenty million gal lons a day when the pollution comes per haps from one mill discharging only one million gallons If one woolen mill on a stream causes pollution that obliges a dozen cities further down the stream to construct filtration works provided they are to drink the water with any degree of safety would it not be more economical to oblige the one mill to purify its compara tively small amount of waste before it is allowed to enter the stream instead of per mitting the pollution of the whole river Vice versa streams already devoted to the service of mills and manufacturies may better serve the general economy by con tinuing in that service and the one or two cities can build filtration plants at less cost than that of purifying the wastes of all the manufactories Only a careful study of the condition of the communities along the banks can ascertain in which way the gain to the whole people is found in which way public economy is best main tained HENRY N OGDEN CORNELL UNIVERSITY MARINE LABORATORY OF THE UNITED STATES FISH COMMISSION A T WOODS HOLE STATION SUMMER SEASON OF 1895 THE present Laboratory of Scientific Re search was constructed after Professor This has been an especially active season at the Government and Marine Biological Laboratories at Woods Hole At our request Professor Peck who Bairds designs in the year 1884 as part of the large building which serves the depart ment of fish culture This is therefore the eleventh season during which scientific re search has been prosecuted under these con ditions both by government patronage and by individual responsibility and it is in structive to look back over these years and see how many wellknown workers have been accommodated here and of how much service these advantages have been to the learned institutions which they rep resent such as Yale Princeton Harvard Johns Hopkins Columbia and the Univer sity of Pennsylvania besides a large num ber of smaller colleges both East and West There have been present at the Labora tory this summer thirty workers represent ing twenty important educational institu tions of this country and one German uni versity four of these institutions are vari ous high schools of the city of Chicago These thirty have been engaged upon such a wide range of problems that only the more notable can be mentioned One piece of research by Prof H V Wilson upon the sponges from the Gulf of California and the Galapagos Islands col lected by the U S steamer Albatross under the direction of Professor Alexander Agas siz has drawn our attention to the value of that side of biological work Embry ology naturally fills a large place here and two phases of it have been followed The first by Prof W Patten deals with ab normal development in Limulus embryos A certain small proportion of the eggs pass through the normal formation of the perfect embryo only to then reverse the process and fade back to the original simple egg condition or a double embryo may be formed or a triple embryo in regu lar sequence or one side of the embryo has been in charge of the research work at the Gov ernment station this summer sends to SCIENCE this informal report SCIENCE 543N S VOL II No 43 may disappear It is expected that the singular behavior of these eggs will throw some light upon the physiology of growth in the embryos It has been the good fortune also of another of our number Dr Lewis Murbach to have obtained the eggs of the beautiful medusa Gonionemus which this season has been unusually abundant in the  eel pond An account of the oc currence of the adult in this locality is be ing prepared while material for a very complete study of the development has also been secured This piece of investigation is well under way and has contributed much of interest to all who have followed its progress Interesting stages in the larval de velopment of Perophora have been observed by Mr George Lefevre as the free swimming tadpole larva settles down to the fixed state with loss of tail and sense organs Much cytological study has been directed upon the ganglion cells of the central nervous system The center of this line of research was at the room of Dr Ira Van Gieson who with his assistant Mr I Strauss made many careful preparations of the ganglia of the invertebrates Mollusca Tunicata An nelida for comparative study while some of the clearest results were obtained from the large motor cells from the brain of the Torpedo Neurological work in other di rections has attracted several investigators and one might mention in this connection the very successful application of the me thyline blue method by Mr J E Peabody to the study of the distribution of the nerve termini in the sense ampullse of the dogfish and Torpedo The workoriginally sug gested and directed by Professor H Ayres is tending toward important results as to the sensory or glandular nature of these characteristic structures Altogether in cluding several students working under the direction of the investigators before men tioned there have been seven of our number engaged in special study of nerves by means of Nissls method the Golgi Weigert and methyline blue methods Another line of research by Dr T H Montgomery Jr was concerned with the histology of the Nemertine worms and has added many interesting features to the anatomy histology and embryology of that group especial attention having been paid this season to the development of the pro boscis It is very encouraging to note how much of the work heretofore enumerated is defi nitely upon its way to publication by the authors Some of it is already promised to leading journals some of it will be incor porated in theses to be offered for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at our universi ties and all of it will I believe find its way into important and useful channels One piece of research by the present writer was advanced directly under the auspices of the U S Fish Commission This relates to the food of fish fry especially of the earliest stages after the embryo becomes capable of freeswimming existence and able to take food the nature of the food of fry of from a quarter to half an inch in length of several families is demonstrated while the results will be published together with previous studies upon planktonic material and the food of certain adult fishes for the Fish Commission Much might be said about the students who have come to this station for their first seaside studies who ask common questions about common things or common questions about rare things or sometimes rare ques tions about common things Their work never grows old is never finished and seems more important each year than it did the year before Inasmuch as no regular in struction is provided at the laboratory much depends upon the careful outlines of work to be furnished students who come here alone by those who have them in charge Great help can be given to students by fur 544 SCIENCEOCTOBER 25 1895 nishing in advance definite ideas of what forms to select for work how to proceed and what to read and if possible by put ting the student into communication with some one who is willing to give an occa sional word of advice This help may be well given in advance at the universities and colleges from which students come as is proved by our experience this season much time thereby is saved for them and their work is more consistent and fruitful Another advantage of the presence of students who are doing work of a more gen eral character is the custom of regular towing and of constantly bringing into the Laboratory fresh supplies of living material of many kinds The tow net is also drawn each day by Collector Vinal N Edwards of this station and this together with the large and beautiful aquaria in the exhibition room of the Laboratory keeps all the men engaged in special research in association with general phenomena of the most at tractive kinds It is very interesting also to see how much material for future work is each year taken from this Laboratory Every re search worker carefully collects all that he can to furnish his basis of study during the winter to come every teacher secures also a collection of forms for class de monstration in the coming academic year while some come here entirely for such general collecting In this way biological work in all of the twenty universities colleges and secondary schools represented here this season will derive many advan tages from this station In this connection we feel that too much cannot be said of our appreciation of the excellent collecting facilities offered here by the equipment of boats and other apparatus nor of our grate ful recognition of the invariable courtesy and co6peration of the U S Fish Commis sion authorities immediately in charge of this station Some of the most pleasant occasions of the summer were the informal gatherings held each Monday evening at one of the large rooms of the Residence at which some of the older members of the Labo ratory described the results of their various lines of investigation Seven different themes of original research were thus presented while the interest was much increased by the very general discussions and questions which followed each talk Altogether this has been a very success ful season at the Laboratory there has been an earnest tone of work that has made it self felt throughout We also owe very much to the advantages coming from our proximity to the Marine Biological Labora tory and consider that much of our success is due to being so near to the active work of that institution We learn just at the closing of the season of the death of the Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries Marshall MacDonald Our grief is very deep at this sad news for he was to all of us who have been associated with him a personal friend whom we loved even as we respected his most liberal mind His generous appreciation of all purely sci entific work was a direct fulfilment of the original design of Professor Baird Com missioner MacDonalds kindness sympathy and personal interest in the young men working at this Laboratory will ever remain as most cherished memories by those who thus knew him J I PECK GEOGRAPHY AT THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION AT the Ipswich meeting of the British Association the Geographical Section was distinguished by the exceptionally small number of papers offered for reading and several of those which were presented were read contrary to the usual practice in the absence of their authors These facts must not be taken as implying any loss of interest SCIENCE 545

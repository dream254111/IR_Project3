J SMEATON THIS ENGINE CONSISTS OF A RECEIVER A STEAM AND AN INJECTIONCOCK A SUCTION AND A FORCINGPIPE EACH FURNISHED WITH A VALVE TOGETHER WITH A BOILER WHICH ON ACCOUNT OF ITS BULK AND WEIGHT IS NOT SENT WITH THE REST BUT AS IT MAY BE OF THE COMMON GLOBULAR SHAPE AND HAVING NOTHING PARTICULAR IN ITS CONSTRUCTION A DE SCRIPTION OF IT WILL NOT BE NECESSARY AS ALSO THE REST OF THESE PARTS ALREADY MENTIONED BEING ESSENTIAL TO EVERY MACHINE OF THIS KIND A FURTHER ACCOUNT OF THEM MAY BE DISPENSED WITH WHAT IS PE CULIAR TO THIS ENGINE IS A FLOAT WITHIN THE RECEIVER COMPOSED OF A LIGHT BALL OF COPPER WHICH IS NOT LOOSE THEREIN BUT FASTENED TO THE END OF AN ARM WHICH IS MADE TO RISE AND FALL BY THE FLOAT WHILE THE OTHER END OF THE ARM IS FASTEND TO AN AXIS AND CON SEQUENTLY AS THE FLOAT MOVES UP AND DOWN THE AXIS IS TURNED ROUND ONE WAY OR THE OTHER THIS AXIS IS MADE CONICAL AND PASSES THROUGH A CONICAL SOCKET WHICH LAST IS SOLDERD TO THE SIDE OF THE RECEIVER UPON ONE OF THE ENDS OF THE AXIS WHICH PROJECTS BEYOND THE SOCKET IS FITTED A SECOND ARM WHICH IS ALSO MOVED BACKWARD AND FORWARD BY THE AXIS AS THE FLOAT RISES OR FALLS BY THESE MEANS THE RISING OR FALLING OF THE SURFACE OF THE WATER WITHIN THE RECEIVER COMMUNICATES A CORRESPONDENT MOTION TO THE OUTSIDE IN ORDER TO GIVE READ NOV 9 1752PHILOS TRANS VOL XLVII TAB XIX P 437 G G K L R T S M N I FORCING PIPE N K O C FORCING

INJECTIONPIPE COMMUNICATING BETWEEN THE FORCINGPIPE ABOVE THE VALVE AND THE TOP OF THE RECEIVER R S IS THE ARM BY WHICH THE KEY OF THE STEAMCOCK IS WORKED I K TWO ROLLERS ANNEXED TO THE BALANCE WHICH BY STRIKING UPON THE ARM R S OPEN AND SHUT THE STEAMCOCK AS THE BALANCE IS MOVED BACKWARD AND FORWARD R N O IS THE STEAMCOCKS KEYTAIL WHICH IS FURNISHED WITH TWO SMALL ROLLERS N O WHICH OPEN AND SHUT THE INJECTIONCOCK BY ACTING UPON THE ARM O M IN SUCH A MANNER THAT WHEN THE STEAMCOCK IS OPENED THE INJECTION IS SHUT AND VICE VERSA T IS A BELL OF ADVICE WHICH MOVING ALONG WITH THE BALANCE CONTINUES TO RING AS LONG AS THE ENGINE IS AT WORK V IS A COCK WHICH SERVES TO DISCHARGE THE AIR FROM THE RECEIVER AND IS OPEND BY HAND WHEN NECESSARY W IS A WEIGHT SUFFICIENT TO RAISE THE BALANCE TO A PER PENDICULAR POSTURE WHEN IT IS INCLINED TO THE RIGHT AND ALSO TO OVERCOME THE FRICTION OF THE FLOAT AXIS PULLIES CHAIN C TO PUT THE ENGINE IN MOTION PRESS DOWN THE ARM AB WHICH WILL BRING THE BALANCE OVER TO THE RIGHT SIDE AND IN ITS MOTION WILL OPEN THE STEAMCOCK AND SHUT438 SHUT THE INJECTION SET OPEN THE COCK AT V THAT THE AIR MAY BE DISCHARGED BY THE ENTRANCE OF THE STEAM INTO THE RECEIVER THIS BEING DONE SHUT THAT COCK AND LET GO THE ARM THE WEIGHT W WILL BRING OVER THE BALANCE TO THE LEFT AND IN ITS MOTION SHUT THE STEAM COCK AND OPEN THE INJECTION THIS PRESENTLY CONDENSING THE STEAM INTO WATER IN A GREAT MEASURE LEAVES A VACUUM IN THE RECEIVER THINGS REMAIN IN THIS SITU ATION TILL THE PRESSURE OF THE ATMOSPHERE HAS CAUSED THE WATER TO MOUNT THRO THE SUCTIONPIPE INTO THE RE CEIVER WHERE AS ITS SURFACE RISES IT CAUSES THE FLOAT TO ASCEND AND DEPRESSING THE ARM A B RAISES THE BA LANCE TILL IT HAS PASSED THE PERPENDICULAR AND IN ITS DESCENT WHICH IS DONE BY ITS OWN GRAVITY THE ROLLER K LAYS HOLD OF THE ARM R S AGAIN OPENS THE STEAMCOCK AND SHUTS THE INJECTION THE RECEIVER BEING NOW AL MOST FILLED WITH WATER THE BALANCE CANNOT RETURN TILL THE SURFACE OF THE WATER THEREIN SUBSIDES AND SUFFERS THE FLOAT TO DESCEND THIS IS PERFORMED BY THE ELASTI CITY OF THE STEAM WHICH AT THE SAME TIME THAT IT FILLS THE RECEIVER DRIVES OUT THE WATER THRO THE FORCING PIPE AND WHEN THE SURFACE IS DESCENDED SO LOW AS TO SUFFER THE WEIGHT W TO BRING THE BALANCE BEYOND THE PERPENDICULAR TOWARDS THE LEFT IT THEN FALLS OF ITS OWN ACCORD AND IN FALLING THE ROLLER I LAYS HOLD OF THE ARM R S SHUTS THE STEAMCOCK AND OPENS THE INJECTION AS BEFORE WHEN THE ENGINE IS DESIRED TO BE STOPPD OBSERVE WHEN THE BALANCE LIES TO THE RIGHT TO TURN ROUND THE ARM O M OF THE INJECTIONCOCK SO THAT THE TAIL OF THE STEAMCOCK MAY MISS IT IN THE NEXT MOTION SO THAT AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE RECEIVER IS FILLD WITH STEAM AND THE STEAMCOCK SHUT THE INJECTION NOT BEING OPENED THE MOTION WILL STOP FOR WANT

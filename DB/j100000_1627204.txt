natural sequence in the appointment of a politician as Director of the Twelfth Census The best that can be said of exGovernor Merriam is that he had a credit able record as Governor of Minnesota The New York Evening Post speaks of the appoint ment as follows Mr Merriam is appointed Director of the Census simply because there was no other good office vacant at home or abroad He has never had any experience as380 SCIENCE N S VOL IX No 219 a statistician and possesses none of those expert qualifications which the place imperatively de mands He is a spoilsman and can be trusted to run the bureau on a spoils basis from top to bottom No appointment could be made which would so certainly secure the failure of the next census as a trustworthy and creditable work MR F H WINES who has been appointed Assistant Director of the Census is an expert statistician THE nomination of Mr Barrows as Librarian of Congress has failed of confirmation by the Senate It is to be hoped that the action of the Senate was due to the fact that Mr Barrows is not a librarian by profession and not to the fact that he is a good executive officer who would probably have administered the National Library

William Rutherford professor of physiology in the University of Edinburgh which occurred on February 21st from a relapse following influ enza We learn from the London Times that Professor Rutherford was born at Ancrum Craig Roxburgshire in 1839 and was educated first at Jedburgh Grammar School and after wards at Edinburgh University where he grad uated with honors in 1863 obtaining a gold medal for his thesis He held office as house physician and house surgeon in the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary under Dr Rutherford Haldane and Professor Spence and then taught anatomy for a year in the Surgeonshall under Dr Struthers He afterwards went to the Conti nent and studied at the great medical schools of Berlin Vienna and Paris In 1865 he was ap pointed University assistant to the late Pro fessor John Hughes Bennett In 1869 when only 30 years of age he was appointed profes sor of physiology in Kings College London a post which he filled for five years during three of which he was also Fullerian professor of physiology in the Royal Institution London His reputation as a teacher and lecturer spread rapidly and in 1874 on the resignation of Pro fessor Hughes Bennett he was appointed to the chair of physiology in Edinburgh University382 SCINCLE N S VOL IX No 219 Here he labored till the close of his life and did much to develop the practical teaching of phys iology both in lectures and by the institution of practical classes His chief work was The Action of Drugs on the Secretion of Bile and he was also the author of  Outlines of Practical Histology and a  Textbook on Physiology besides many papers on various scientific sub jects His recent efforts were chiefly directed to the study of hearing sight and other special senses He was also the inventor of the freez ing microtome which has proved of great value in microscopical research and demonstration In 1876 Professor Rutherford was elected a Fel low of the Royal Society of London THE French Mathematical Society is making active arrangements for the International Con gress of Mathematicians to be held at Paris from the 6th to the 12th of August 1900 Re plies have already been received from 900 in tending

of which Professor Newcomb is the chairman is collecting information in regard to the best methods for observing the total eclipse of the sun on May 28 1900 The track of the shadow runs from New Orleans to Norfolk and across to Spain and Algeria Ar rangements are also being made by the British Astronomical Society A paper was read by Mr A C D Krommelin before the Society on February 22d As a result of a close study of the weather statistics the conclusions he drew were 1 That Algiers was certainly worth occupying on account of its low cloud ratio it accessibility and its excellent harbor 2 that the Portuguese stations had a higher cloud ratio but a longer totality 1 mim 36 sec as compared with 1 min 6 sec at Algiers 3 the region south of Madrid had a low cloud ratio and several railway lines cut the shadow track so that there would be no difficulty in trans porting instruments 4 the Alicante region seemed less clear than central Spain but more so than Portugal The Associations special steamer could land detachments at various points on the Portuguese and Spanish coasts and then proceed to Algiers with the remainder of the party It could remain at Algiers as a floating hotel to the party and after the eclipse return by the same route picking up the various detachments American Gardening New York City offers prizes amounting to 150 for papers on hybrid

work on pear blight conducted by Mr M B Waite of the Division of Vegetable Physiology and Pathology United States Department of Agriculture an interest ing feature has been developed in the way of growing the bacillus of blight on dormant pear shoots The fact that the organism could be grown in this way was discovered by Mr Waite about two years ago and it furnishes means of throwing light ona number of points connectedMARCH 10 1899 SCIENCE 383 with the disease For illustrative purposes in class rooms or elsewhere it forms one of the most striking examples of the effects produced by a bacterial plant disease Shoots the size of a lead pencil or a little larger are cut from pear trees and after being washed in a clean water their upper ends are cut in a slanting way with a sharp sterilized knife The shoots are then placed in a glass containing water with the slanting ends free The glass and its con tents are now set in a plate or dish containing water and a bell jar or large beaker placed over them in such a way that the rim is im mersed in the water in the plate This insures a saturated atmosphere and other conditions unfavorable to the shoots but favorable to the germs themselves Infections with pure cul tures of the blight bacillus on the slanting cut surfaces of the shoots begin to show as beautiful pearlywhite beadlike colonies in from 36 to 48 hours and as the disease progresses which it does more or less rapidly under varying con ditions of heat the changes in the host and para site may be easily watched THE new Turbinia of 220 feet in length and 330 tons displacement is as we learn from the London Times in an advanced state of construc tion at Ellswick and hopes are being enter tained of her being tried in two months from the present time The modifications found to be desirable after the exhaustive trials of her predecessor are considerable The new vessel has eight propellers on four shafts instead of the original Turbinias three shafts and nine propellers Her  goingastern  arrangements are far in advace of those of the pioneer boat whose extreme speed caused great excitment in the Solent at the time of the Naval Review of 1897

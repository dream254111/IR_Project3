THE PRONOUNCED TENDENCY OF THE COURTS TO HOLD THE INSURANCE COM PANIES LIABLE IN ANY EVENT HAS SHOWN ITSELF IN THESE CASES THUS IN TWO NOTABLE CASES ON ALL FOURS WITH THE PRINCIPAL CASE THE POLICIES

48 L R A N S 184 THE PRINCIPAL GROUND UPON WHICH THESE TWO HOLDINGS AND THE CASES FOLLOWING THEM ARE BASED IS THE FACT THAT THE INSURER EXERCISING HIS OPTION UNDER THE INSURANCE POLICY DEFENDED THE SUIT AGAINST THE INSURED THIS WAS CONSTRUED TO CHANGE THE POLICY OF INDEMNITY TO ONE BY WAY OF LIABILITY ON THE GROUND THAT THE WORD DEFEND AS USED IN THE POLICY MEANS A SUCCESSFUL DEFENSE THROUGH ALL THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE SUIT TO EXECUTION ISSUED ON A JUDGMENT THUS THAT IF THE INSURER CHOSE TO DEFEND THE SUIT WHICH TERMINATED IN A JUDG MENT AGAINST THE INSURED THE FORMER AT ONCE BECAME LIABLE

MUST BE DETERMINED ON GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW NOT UNTIL THE RELATION OF DEBTOR AND CRED ITOR EXISTS BETWEEN INSURER AND INSURED DO THIRD PARTIES AS CREDITORS OF THE INSURED HAVE ANY RIGHT TO SUBJECT

AN ACTION OF FRAUD AND DECEIT AGAINST FOUR JOINT TORTFEASORS EXECUTED A GENERAL RELEASE UNDER SEAL DISCHARGING TWO OF THEM BUT EXPRESSLY RESERVING TO HERSELF ALL RIGHT IN AND TO THE JUDGMENT AND THE

N Y SUPP 974 IT IS WELL SETTLED THAT THE RELEASE OF ONE JOINT TORTFEASOR IN THE AB SENCE OF ANY RESERVATION OF RIGHTS AGAINST THE OTHER TORTFEASORS OP ERATES AS A DISCHARGE IN LAW OF ALL GILPATRICK V HUNTER 24 ME 18 AL DRICK V DARNCLL 147 MASS 409 BUT THERE IS A DECIDED CONFLICT AS TO THE EFFECT OF A RELEASE OF ONE OR MORE OF SEVERAL JOINT TORTFEASORS WITH AN EXPRESS RESERVATION OF RIGHTS AGAINST THE REST SOME OF THE COURTS HOLD THAT THE RESERVATION IS VOID AND THAT ALL ARE RELEASED NOTWITH STANDING THE ATTEMPTED RESERVATION MCBRIDE V SCOTT 132 MICH 176 93 N W 243 102 AM ST REP 416 61 L R A 445 THE REASONING UPON WHICH THIS DOCTRINE IS BASED IS THAT AS THE TORT IS INTEGRAL AND INDIVISIBLE ANY CLAIM FOR INJURIES THEREFROM IS ALSO INDIVISIBLE AND IF THE INSTRUMENT IS HELD TO BE A RELEASE OF ANY ONE IT MUST NECESSARILY EXTINGUISH THE WHOLE CLAIM AND RELEASE ALL THE JOINT TORTFEASORS FROM ANY LIABILITY THEREUNDER ABB V NORTHERN PACIFIC RY CO 28 WASH 428 68 PAC 954 92 AM ST REP 864 58 L R A 293 THE RESERVATION IS VOID AS BEING REPUGNANT TO THE LEGAL EFFECT AND OPERATION OF THE RELEASE ITSELF GUNTHER V LEE 45 MD 60 OTHER COURTS HOLD AND THIS DOCTRINE SEEMS TO BE MORE IN ACCORD WITH THE MODERN VIEW THAT SUCH AN IN STRUMENT SHOULD BE GIVEN EFFECT ACCORDING TO THE OBVIOUS INTENT OF THE PERSON EXECUTING IT AND THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE TREATED AS A TECHNICAL RELEASE OPERATING TO DESTROY THE CAUSE OF ACTION AS AGAINST ANY OR ALL OF THE JOINT TORTFEASORS BUT RATHER AS A COVENANT NOT TO SUE THE PARTY IN WHOSE FAVOR THE INSTRUMENT RUNS GILBERT V FINCH 173 N Y 455 66 N E 133 61 L R A 807 CARY V BILBY C C A 129 FED 203 BUT A DIFFERENT AND SOMEWHAT BETTER SETTLED QUESTION ARISES WHEN THE RELEASE IS MADE TO SOME OF THE JOINT TORTFEASORS WITH AN EXPRESS RES ERVATION OF ALL RIGHTS AGAINST THE REST AFTER A JUDGMENT HAS BEEN OB TAINED AGAINST ALL AS IN THE PRINCIPAL CASE FOR A CAUSE OF ACTION FOUNDED ON TORT WHEN REDUCED TO A JUDGMENT BECOMES AS TO ALL A JOINT INDEBTEDNESS MISSOURI K  T

BEFORE OR AFTER JUDGMENT BROWNS ADMINS V LITTLE KY 170 S W 168 CONTRA DULANEY V BUFFUM 173 MO 1 73 S W 125 IT APPEARS THAT THE SOUNDEST BASIS UPON WHICH TO PLACE THE DECISION IN THE PRINCIPAL CASE IS THAT THE JUDGMENT CREATED A JOINT INDEBTEDNESS AND THAT THE STATUTE ALLOWED A PART OF THE JOINT DEBTORS TO BE RELEASED WITHOUT DISCHARGING THE REST THE RELEASE CAN NOT REASONABLY BE CONSTRUED A COVENANT NOT TO SUE SINCE SUIT HAD AL READY BEEN BROUGHT AND A JUDGMENT OBTAINED BEFORE IT WAS EXECUTED DUCEY V PATERSON 37 COL 216 86 PAC 109 MIARRIAGEANNULMENT ON THE GROUND OF FRAUDTHE DEFENDANT

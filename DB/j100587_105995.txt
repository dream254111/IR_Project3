XVI A Description of a petrified Stratum formed from the Waters of Matlock in Derbyshire By Mathew Dobson M D Communicated by Dr Fother gill DURING a short stay at MATLOCK this summer I made some ob servations on the petrifying quality of the waters and examined a very singular Stratum which has been formed in their course Redde Jan 13 1774 This Stratum I found about 500 yards in length in several places near 100 yards in breadth and where thickest from 3 to 4 yards in depth The manner in which this body of stone has been pro duced is easily ascertained Within the memory of some persons now alive the waters of Matlock were not appropriated to the purposes either of bathing or drinking They issued from near the bottom of the hill which lies to the west immediately behind the present houses and ran at random down a de clivity of about 100 yards to the river DERWENT In their course they formed large petrified masses intermingled with great quantities of petrified moss nuts leaves acorns pieces of wood and even trunks of trees 3 The125 The waters were thus constantly raising ob stacles to their own progress and were frequently therefore forced into new channels so as by de grees to be extended over a surface of at least 500 yards in length And by being repeatedly re turned into the same channels a Stratum of con siderable thickness has been formed On examining this Stratum some parts are dis covered to be extremely hard and others so soft as easily to be cut The soft parts however on exposure to the air become as hard as flint and on being struck sound like metal The reason of this difference in the hardness of different parts appears to be this as the waters frequently changed their channels and repeatedly likewise returned again to the same channels if in the in tervals there were any parts considerably raised and consequently longer before they were covered with fresh incrustations these from a longer ex posure to the air would acquire a greater degree of hardness Whole houses in the neighbourhood are built of this stone which they find more durable than any other they meet with and as it has the ex cellent property of growing harder from being exposed and has likewise many little cavities and interstices good mortar so insinuates itself into these as to form a wall as firm as one continued stone This Stratum affords very curious and beauti fully varied petrifactions Moss exhibits great varieties for it is evident that the moss has con tinued to vegetate after the roots and lower parts had126 had been penetrated by the stony particles and thus stretching itself to a considerable extent it has in some places been mixed and interwoven with other substances In some parts snails have been arrested in their sluggish walks and locked up in the stony concrete In others the petrify ing matter has shot in different directions and formed an intricate kind of network And in others again there are large masses which on being broken asunder are found hollow and their cavities ornamented with branches of petri faction somewhat resembling coral but of a darkishwhite colour and generally of a rough and granulated surface Under the Stratum there is from a foot to a foot and a half of good soil and immediately under this lies the limestone rock The soil is of the same nature with that of the adjoining fields which form the slope of the hill and is evidently a continuation of that soil Any further additions to this petrisied Stralum are now inconsiderable and in many places none at all for the two principal springs are confined to their channels covered from the day through the greatest part of their course and are rapid in their motion Had proper observations been made on the pro gress of this Stratum a tolerably exact estimate might have been formed with respect to the time when these waters were first impregnated with their mineral ingredients From these two con siderations however that the Stratum is not very thick and that the soil immediately under it is a continu127 continuation of that which lies on the slope of the neighbouring hills it is probable that many centuries have not been requisite to its production and consequently that these mineral waters are not of very antient date And if we may rely upon an observation which I had from a plain inquisitive and intelligent man on the spot the source whence these waters derive their impregnation is in some degree ex hausted This person assured me from his own experience that pieces of moss and other sub stances put in the course of the waters and in the same circumstances as formerly require more than double the time for their petrifaction that they did thirty years ago The Stratum therefore from which the Matlock waters are impregnated must either be considerably exhausted or the waters have de viated from their former course and are now only partially distributed over this Stratum Leverpool Oct 15 1773 XVII

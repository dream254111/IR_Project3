of the City of New York HT HE socalled Payasyougo policy for the City of New York which has been practically abolished by recent legislation can be understood only in the light of con ditions existing prior to its adoption This policy was first put into effect by resolutions adopted by the Board of Estimate and Apportionment in September 1914 and was afterwards made mandatory by an act of the legislature passed in the early part of 1916 On May 13 1918 Governor Whitman signed a bill which then became a law suspending the operation of the previous statute for the period of the war and for one year thereafter For all practical purposes this may be regarded as its total repeal From the earliest times it has been the policy of the City of New York to meet the expense of public improvements of an enduring character such as public schools hospitals engine houses police stations correctional institutions courts water supply docks and rapid transit by the proceeds of the sale of longterm bonds commonly known as corporate stock The longest period for which such corporate stock has been permitted to be issued is fifty years Provision is made for the payment of interest on such corporate stock and its redemption at maturity by including in the annual tax levy of each year a sum sufficient to pay the interest for that year and to provide a sinking fund which at maturity shall equal the par value of the corporate stock In this manner the cost of such public improvements of an enduring character was spread over the life of the improvement and those who enjoyed the benefits from year to year made payment there for in the tax levy of such year In theory at least this was a just apportionment of the costs and benefits of such public improvements The difficulty with this principle in actual practice was that longterm corporate stock 1Read at the National Conference on War Economy June 6 1918No 1 PAYASYOUGO POLICY IN NEW YORK was issued for improvements which in many instances were of very brief duration It has been conventional for writers upon this subject to accuse Tammany administrations of having bought per ishable supplies with the proceeds of fiftyyear corporate stock The accusation has been made in such form as to imply that the practice in question was peculiar to Tammany administrations Such however is not the case Those who have proceeded in this manner are found in every administration of whatever party or combination of parties it may consist Under fusion or reform administrations material of the most perishable and unenduring character has been acquired with the proceeds of fiftyyear cor porate stock As late as the 17th of April 1914 by unanimous vote of the fusion Board of Estimate and Apportionment fifty year corporate stock was appropriated the proceeds to be used for the removal of piles and foundations of the Old Iron Pier and for the removal of other piers and jetties from the beach fronting Seaside Park at Coney Island This offense against the principles of sound finance was not actually confined to the use of fiftyyear corporate stock for this purpose but the appropriation was so diverted that it was substantially exhausted leaving the principal work unfinished The consequence was that the present Board of Estimate and Apportionment four years later had to make an additional appropriation to do the work in question the cost of which was met from a budgetary item Under the Low administration horses horse collars cans and can carriers and like paraphernalia for the use of the street clean ing department was purchased with the proceeds of long term corporate stock running mostly for forty years This was for a ten years longer maturity than had been authorized by any prior administration This practice was wholly discontinued in the second McClellan administration For many years it was the practice in the dock department to meet the ordinary expenses of administration maintenance and operation by the proceeds of longterm corporate stock This practice also was discontinued in the second McClellan administration and a charter amendment was procured making it unlawful During the Low administra tion a large amount of longterm corporate stock running mostly for forty years was authorized for the purpose of repaving the streets of the city It is needless to say that the average duration of any pavement is substantially less than forty years At the 95CONFERENCE ON WAR ECONOMY present time about 58000000 of corporate stock of the City of New York issued for repaving is outstanding practically all of which runs for forty or fifty years In the Gaynor administration this practice was abandoned and since that time corporate stock for repaving has not been issued for a greater period than ten years The extent of such practices and the constant criticism thereof usually aimed at Tammany administrations as though they were the sole offenders when in fact they have established reforms must have materially affected the credit of the City of New York When therefore the enormous issues of corporate stock necessi tated for the Catskill water supply and the dual subway system were pressed upon the market from year to year it was inevita ble that a large portion of such sales should be undigested and the price materially affected This has been reflected in the ad vancing interest rate prior to the outbreak of the present war in 1914 and also in a constantly lower level of prices for New York city corporate stock These were some of the elements of the situation that existed when the socalled Payasyougo policy was adopted in September 1914 In its full scope and operation that policy prohibited the use of corporate stock for any period whatever for any of the various classes of public improvements that were not of a revenuepro ducing character The payasyougo policy implied that all such public improvements of whatever duration and for whatever pur pose if nonrevenueproducing were to be paid for by the taxes raised in the year in which the improvement was made The policy was put into effect by stages In the first stage it was provided that such improvements authorized thereafter in 1914 and in 1915 should be financed onequarter from the tax levy and threequarters from fifteenyear serial bonds Those authorized in 1916 were to be paid onehalf from tax levy and onehalf from serial bonds Those authorized in 1917 were to be paid threequarters from tax levy and onequarter from fifteen year serial bonds Finally all such improvements authorized after January 1 1918 were to be paid out of the taxes of the year in which they were made Such was the situation that confronted the present administra tion in New York city on January  1918 It was found in practice that the payasyougo principle as thus applied had a VOL VIII 96No 1 PAYASYOUGO POLICY IN NEW YORK marked tendency to increase the tax rate in order to meet the cost of necessary public improvements of a nonrevenueproduc ing character The city was confronted with an unfinished sub way system which if the work had progressed according to the original program with negligible exceptions would have been completed and in operation A vast amount of work and expense was required to complete the dual subway system The carrying charges for interest and amortization upon the outlays required and the deficits which the city is compelled to meet were making a constantly increasing drain upon the citys resources and a ma terial addition to its tax rate In order for the city to have suffi cient borrowing capacity to embark upon the dual subway enter prise and to keep the tax rate within constitutional limits there was resort to the device of increasing the assessed valuations of real estate all over the City of New York This increase was car ried to an extent that has evoked the criticism that in many instances the assessed valuation is greatly in excess of the actual value The president of the department of taxes and assessments under the preceding administration officially stated to the state tax commissioners representing the State Board of Equalization at Albany that the assessments in the Borough of Manhattan in 1916 averaged 106 of the sales value of property sold against which the assessments could be checked Until such time as the population of the undeveloped portions of Brooklyn Queens and Bronx boroughs had increased to a point where there was sufficient traffic to support the newly constructed dual sub way lines there was a constantly increasing peril that the assessed valuations in those boroughs would suffer a decrease from the lack of such operation and settlement To diminish the deficits that the city has to meet under the dual subway operation it is necessary that the population of these three boroughs in particular be speedily increased so as to provide reve nues for the new subway lines Any increase in the tax rate in those boroughs was a distinct check upon private improvements and increase in population and operated to defeat the objective that the city must attain to carry the dual subway system The tax rate in Queens for 1918 was 256 except for a special act of the legislature which became a law the day before the rate was fixed and permitted a part of the tax to be deferred to a later year so that the actual rate for 1918 is 241 9798 CONFERENCE ON WAR ECONOMY VOL VIII The mounting rate of taxation due to the operation of the pay asyougo policy manifested two serious consequences First it repelled improvements No sensible business man would locate a manufacturing plant or other industry subject to such a rate especially when by a slight shift in location he could either be entirely outside the City of New York or in an adjoining state Second the mounting tax burden superinduced an increased num ber of mortgage foreclosure and tax lien sales Property owners were unable to bear the additional strain particularly under war conditions As the number of such forced sales increased market valuations inevitably declined Indeed as a matter of strict legal right other property owners would be entitled to have their assess ments reduced to the level of market values thus made Thus the city might easily be forced to exceed its debt limit without any increase in its indebtedness because of the reduction in assessed values of real estate Moreover large appropriations had been made particularly for educational purposes which the payasyougo law made practically unavailable This was due to the circumstance that the purposes for which such appropria tions were originally made had been modified by the educational authorities But the appropriations could not be modified because if the old appropriations were rescinded a new appropriation could not be made after January 1 1918 except upon the pay asyougo basis or to be met 100 out of current taxes About 12000000 of appropriations previously made for the department of education were thus affected and rendered prac tically unavailable This condition if continued would greatly aggravate congestion in public schools and the parttime evil Moreover we must reckon with the ever increasing burdens of the present war and the direct state tax By way of analogy it may be said that if the federal govern ment met all of the expenses of the present war by taxation with out resorting to the sale of liberty bonds we should have the pay asyougo policy as applied to the war and every person who now holds a liberty bond would instead be the possessor of a tax receipt Under such circumstances the present controller of the City of New York prepared and had introduced into the legislature a bill to repeal the payasyougo act passed in 1916 and to substi tute therefor what he considers the correct payasyougo prinNo 1 PAYASYOUGO POLICY IN NEW YORK ciple This principle is that the payasyougo policy is applicable alike to revenueproducing as well as nonrevenueproducing im provements and that the cost of all such improvements of an enduring character should be met by corporate stock or serial bonds the maturity of which can in no event exceed the normal life of the improvement paid for thereby The cost of such improvements is contributed by each years taxpayers who enjoy the benefits thereof and whose taxes provide for the interest for such year and if a serial bond for the instalment thereof due that year and if a sinkingfund bond for the proper contribution to pay it at maturity No reasonable distinction can be made between revenuepro ducing and nonrevenueproducing improvements in the applica tion of this principle The bill in question was drawn after extended conferences with those familiar with the subject many of whom had been interested in the adoption of the prior policy In order to avoid the excesses from vicious financing of earlier days the bill expressed the duration for which corporate stock for various purposes should be issued For example for the acquisition of real estate water supply rapid transit and like improvements it was very generally conceded that fifty years was proper maturity Unquestionably real estate unless for a sea side park would endure for fifty years and ordinarily its value would be as great then as now In England they are issuing obligations running for seventyfive years for the acquisition of real estate for public purposes The reference to the kind of real estate that might be part of a seaside park is in relation to a large seaside park near Neponsit since the acquisition of which forty seven acres have been carried away by the tide hardly a very enduring piece of real estate Part of it is now over on the Jersey coast Corporate stock for fireproof buildings and similar improve ments was limited in its duration to forty years Other periods were specified for improvements of a less enduring character The resolution of appropriation is required to express the dura tion of the improvement and fix the maturity of the corporate stock authorized As an illustration of that I might say that officials who have acquired the habit from former administrations have recommended that longterm corporate stock be issued to pay for window shades in one of the hospitals that is being equipped 99CONFERENCE ON WAR ECONOMY We make them pay for these out of their budget appropriation for 1918 This is merely an illustration of how deeply ingrained is the disposition to use longterm bonds for the most ephermal improvements These were the reasons for the payasyougo policy and I think we have now discovered the correct application of it This bill as originally prepared was in the form of an amend ment to the Greater New York charter to correct the changes made by the payasyougo act of 1916 In the course of dis cussion in the legislature it appeared that it would be more expe dient to leave the charter provisions for the present as they stand and to change the form of the bill in question to an emergency act Accordingly the bill was slightly changed by providing a new title describing it as An Act for the Relief of the City of New York in Financing its Obligations During the Period of the War and One Year Thereafter in Reference to the Issuance of Corporate Stock and Serial Bonds It then provided that 15 000000 of such securities may be issued in any single year in addition to any that may be authorized under existing laws The existing laws provide for the issuance of corporate stock for revenueproducing purposes and for special purposes including rapid transit and water supply such as the new court house and site Bronx Parkway and change of grade crossings I commend to you that you make an assault upon the state legislature of New York at its next session to repeal those special acts which permit bodies that are not accountable to taxpayers to appropriate longterm corporate stock for such purposes as the Bronx Parkway practically without limit Of course we have the courthouse site for which no more money can be spent be cause it is not there to spend but that property could be made available for other public purposes if the courthouse act were repealed As the matter now stands that property is practically condemned to idleness until such time as the city may see fit and may have the funds to build a new courthouse or may abandon the enterprise entirely That is a matter absolutely in the hands of the legislature We got a bill through the senate this year to make that change so as to render the property available for war purposes but the assembly smothered it for political reasons The practical effect of the 15000000 provision is to permit authorizations to that extent for nonrevenueproducing purposes 100 VOL VIIINo 1 PAYASYOUGO POLICY IN NEW YORK such as school houses hospitals correctional institutions fire and police protection The limitation of 15000000 was agreed upon as the minimum requirement of the City of New York after an exhaustive inquiry into the subject The policy of the present Board of Estimate and Apportion ment is not to authorize a public improvement of any kind that is not distinctly of a war character There is no chance what ever for any appropriations being made for the acquisition of new parks or the improvement and erection of buildings of any kind that do not distinctly and directly contribute to the success ful diligent and speedy prosecution of the war This bill passed both branches of the legislature without oppo sition except of a political character This opposition was con tinued before the governor to the very last moment of the thirty day period It was of a purely political character doubtless intended to cripple and embarrass the present city administration in dealing with war conditions and caring adequately for educa tional hospital fire and police necessities Although Governor Whitman was of the same political faith as the most insistent opponents of the measure he took the broader point of view being convinced that the relief provided by the bill was imperatively required This was the last bill that the Governor signed before the expiration of the thirtyday period It became a law by his signature and is known as chapter 658 of the laws of 1918 101

possibility of killing a human being by electricity without inflicting torture the death to be instantaneous and the progress of the arrangements for the worlds fair to be held here in I892 At the electrical hearing all shades of opinion have been expressed by those called upon to testify By some it is maintained that death is by no means sure to follow the application of currents of high potential that the ac tion of the electricity is liable to be erratic and that the attempt to put to death by electricity the criminal now under sentence may lead to unlawful torture By others including Mr Edison it is testified that death will be sure and painless on applying the strong electric currents proposed The exhibition plans have progressed to the stage of a meeting of prominent citizens at the mayors office for a discussion of preliminaries The daily papers of this city as well as many of the more prominent ones of other cities have taken up the subject energetically and appear to be unanimously in favor of the project One or two of the larger Western cities seem to think that the proper place for such an exhibition would be at one of the great cities of the West somewhere nearer the centre of the continent than New York but the general consensus of opinion seems to be that the metropolis of the continent is the place at which to fitly celebrate the four hundredth anniversary of that continents discovery VOL XIV No 338 ANTS IN the second bulletin issued by the Hatch Experiment Station of the Massachusetts Agricultural College an account was given of experiments made for the destruction of ants in lawns and walks but no methods were given for those that find their way into houses and become an intolerable nuisance because of their desire for sugar and other sweets These are more frequently the small species but what they lack in size they usually make up for in numbers Mr C H Fernald is inclined to the opinion that they enter the houses and discover the coveted articles by chance that their scouts in exploring find these articles not by keen sight or smell but by mere accident When one has found some choice dainty she these wingless workers are undeveloped females not neuters as some have supposed sips her fill and at once starts for home where by some means she communicates the information of the locality of untold treasures to others which return with her and they in turn appear to spread the information on their return home and soon the throngs that come and go are sufficient to disturb the most amiable of housekeepers Various remedies have been suggested one of which is to draw a chalkmark on the floor around the sugarbarrels or other articles to be protected from themf It is undoubtedly true that ants travel in a regular beaten track as it were by the sense of smell and if this be removed from the ground over which they travel they are at a loss and often wander around for some time before they find the trail again They may be thrown off the trail by drawing a chalkmark or even the finger across it This is only a temporary protection however for sooner or later they will find their way across and then travel goes on as uninterruptedly as before It has been recommended to sprinkle sugar into a sponge and place it in their path and as it fills up with ants several times a day immerse it in hot water to kill those adhering to it This will undoubtedly prove successful if carefully followed up for some time but when we remember that the females are constantly laying eggs to produce workers which will take the places of those already destroyed the task seems almost hopeless There can be no doubt that a better method would be to follow the ants carefully and discover if possible where their nest is and then destroy the entire community by making one or more holes down through the nest and then pouring in a teaspoonful of bisul phide of carbon carefully stamping down the ground afterwards to close the holes The fumes of this substance will penetrate the nest in all directions and destroy the entire community COLIC OF HORSES BULLETIN No 2 Vol II of the Ohio Agricultural Experiment Station is a comprehensive treatise on colic of horses by Dr H J Detmers the veterinarian of the station It begins with a brief introduction and a definition of what is understood by the term  colic showing that the same is applied not to a single disease but to quite a number of morbid processes which have their seat in the digestive canal and produce violent manifestations of pain It then dwells at length on the various causes and not only explains their action or their effect upon the animal organism but also draws attention to formerly overlooked facts which throw light upon the origin of many cases of colic and the morbid processes of the same which cannot be accounted for in any other way It fully and comprehensively describes the symptoms gives all the data necessary for the diagnosis and prog nosis and finally in plain language maps out a rational treatment which is simple enough to be understood by everybody and easy enough of application to be executed by any intelligent person One plate illustrating the cause of certain morbid changes peculiar to horses and mules and predisposing the same to the most frequent of these diseases usually called colic accompanies the treatise In the  Fifth Annual Report of the Ohio Agricultural Experi ment Station for I886 pp 296303 Dr Detmers published a brief article on the causes of colic of horses He then stated that his observations had confirmed Professor Bollingers assertion that nearly every aged horse has an aneurism a soft pulsating tumor in an artery in the anterior mesenteric artery that such an aneu rism is produced by the presence of a small worm Sclerostomum

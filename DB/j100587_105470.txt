T O N President To the C O U N C I L and F E L L O W S Of the R O Y A L S O C I E T Y This DISCOURSE is with all Humility inscribed By their humble Servant Thomas Hornsby THE observations of the late Transit of Venus though made with all possible care and accuracy have not enabled us to determine with certainty the real quantity of the suns parallax since by a comparison of the observations made in several parts of the globe the suns parallax is not less than 812 nor does it seem to exceed 10 From the labours of those gentlemen who have 1 attempted Read Feb 13 1766327 attempted to deduce this quantity from the theory of gravity it should seem that the earth performs its annual revolution round the sun at a greater distance than is generally imagined since Mr Pro fessor Stewart has determined the suns parallax to be only 6 9 and Mr Mayer the late celebrated Professor at Gottingen who hath brought the lunar tables to a degree of perfection almost unexpected is of opinion that it cannot exceed 8  In this uncertainty the astronomers of the present age are peculiarly fortunate in being able so soon to have recourse to another transit of Venus in 1769 when on account of that planets north latitude a difference in the total duration may conveniently be observed greater than could possibly be obtained or was even expected by Dr Halley from the last transit The experience which we gained in the year 1761 the knowledge of the errors from whatever cause they may arise which must unavoidably be committed in observations of this kind will enable us to put in practice every method of solving this problem and to determine with what degree of ac curacy and within what limits the true quantity of the suns parallax may be obtained and consequently the dimensions of the whole solar system But before I proceed to give a computation of the effect of parallax at the several places where this transit ought to be observed it will be necessary to pre mise the principles upon which the general calculus was  Mr Machin Professor of Astronomy at Gresham College deduced the same quantity many years ago See a tract entitled The Laws of the Moons Motion according to Gravity p 24 formed328 formed Having found by computing the observa tions made on the transit in 1761 that when the Abbe de la Cailles solar tables are used the epoch of the mean motion of Venus for 1761 as given in Dr Halleys tables requires a correction of  52 12 and that the place of the ascending node was at the beginning of the same year in 2 14 31 10 having collected also by computing the observations of Mr Horrox in 1639 with the assistance of Dr Halleys tables of Venus and the solar tables above mentioned that the motion of the planets mean longitude is 6 19 12 22 and of the node 52 18 in 100 Julian years I have supposed the mean longitude of Venus in the beginning of the year 1769 to 0 5 23 48 and the place of the node to be in 2 14 35 21 and have assumed the rest of the planets elements as given in Dr Hal leys tables According to these numbers and the Abbe de la Cailles solar tables the ecliptic conjunction will happen on June 3d 1769 at 9h 59 24 mean time at Greenwich the planets geocentric lati tude being 10 13 5 N The log of the earths distance from the sun  50065166 the log of Venuss distance from the sun  48610947 and of the planets distance from the earth  44606784 and the equation of the praecession of the equinoctial points   177 By computing the geocentric longitude and latitude of the planet three hours be fore and three hours after the ecliptic conjunction I find the planets hourly motion from the sun in the ecliptic  3 57 7 the hourly motion in the re lative orbit  4 0 3 the hourly motion in lati tude  0 35 45 the angle of the planets path with329 with the ecliptic  8 29 02 the angle of the ecliptic with the equator  7 02 54 and there fore the angle made by the planets visible path with the equator  15 31 56 The geocentric lati tude is as has been observed  10 13 5 and hence it is easily determined that the least distance of the centers will be 10 06 8 and the interval between the time of the ecliptic conjunction and the middle of the transit  22 21 of time As the planet has not yet passed its node the middle of the transit will therefore be at 10h 21 45 mean time at Greenwich In every inferior conjunction the motion of Venus is retrograde and therefore the effect of the aberration of light in long  37 when reduced to time  55 is to accelerate the several phases of the transit the equated mean time of the middle therefore will be at 10h 20 50 But the place of the planet is also affected by the aberration of light in latitude and as Venuss lati tude is decreasing the least distance of the centers will be increased by 1 35 The equated least distance of the centers therefore will be 10 08 15 Now supposing the semidiameter of the sun  15 456 and of Venus  29 the semi durations or intervals between the middle and the external and internal contacts will be found  3h 10 08 5 and 2h 51 132 The equation of time is about 2 14 at the middle of the transit by which quantity the apparent time is before the mean and decreases at the rate of about 2 in 6 hours Therefore the apparent times of the several phases of this transit for the meridian of Greenwich are as follows VOL LV U u First330 App time h   First external contact June 3 7 12 56 Total ingress   7 31 52 Middle    10 23 04 Beginning of egress   13 14 16 Last contact   13 33 11 Hitherto we have had no regard to parallax and the above times are such as would be observed from the earths center To the British isles and to the neighbouring parts of the continent the effect of parallax is nearly at a maximum and will consider ably accelerate the times of external contact and in gress If we suppose the suns parallax on the day of the transit  87 the horizontal parallax of Venus from the sun will be 2187 and the times of the external and internal contacts visible in England will be accelerated by the joint effects of parallax both in the direction of the planets path and perpendicular to it the former by 7 09 the latter by 7 12 And therefore Venus will be seen to touch the suns limb at 7h 5 47 more than an hour before the time of sunset when the apparent altitude of the planet above the horizon will be about 8 degrees and the total ingress will happen at 7h 24 40 when the planets altitude will exceed 5 degrees If the suns parallax should be one second larger than we have supposed or 97 the time of ingress will happen at 7h 23 51 These times are not here given with any great de gree of confidence but as the errors in the planets orbit will in June 1769 be nearly the same with those331 those which were observed 8 years before it may be presumed that the foregoing computation will be found not to differ very widely from the truth Having rectified the globe to the declination of the sun at the middle of the transit22 26 40 and also at the times of the two internal contacts I find that the whole transit will be visible to a considerable part of Swedish Lapland the northernmost parts of Asia and the northern and N W parts of North America for the circle of illumination at the first internal con tact passes along the western coast of Africa from Cape Verd through the Straits of Gibraltar to Cler mont in France leaving Paris about a degree and a half to the West from thence it passes through Germany and along the Baltic Gulf through Wi bourg and Archangel along the northern coast of Asia and then traversing the N E parts of Siberia it passes over Japan enters the great Atlantic ocean leaves the Marian isles and New Zealand on the West and running round Cape Horn and near Falkland isle passes on to Cape Verd through the Ethiopic ocean in a direction nearly parallel to the eastern coast of South America All places situated under the first part of this line from Nova Zembla towards Cape Horn will see Venus enter upon the sun at the time of sunsetting and at sunrising un der the other half of it The circle of illumination at the beginning of egress enters Europe to the North of Drontheim in Norway and crossing the Bothnic and Finland gulfs passes over Muscovy and the Caspian sea and running through Persia traverses the Arabian gulf going southward near the isles of Mal divia and taking a large circuit towards the South U u 2 Pole332 Pole returns through Mexico Louisiana Canada and the southern parts of Greenland to Drontheim So that almost all Africa is deprived of a view of this transit and a very considerable part of Europe If we examine the observations of the transit in 1761 in places where there were more observers than one and where the contacts were observed when the sun was near the horizon and at higher altitudes we may safely conclude that the observations will be made with sufficient accuracy when the sun is at such altitudes above the horizon as not to be greatly affected by the vapours At the Observatory at Upsal when the suns altitude at the ingress was 3 12 degrees three observers differed 22 whereas at the egress when the sun was 4414 high the difference amounted only to 6 It should seem therefore that observers ought not to be sent to places where the sun will be much less than 5 high at the time of either of the contacts It appears by computation that the joint effect of the parallaxes both in longitude and latitude to lengthen the total duration will be the greatest to those places which are about 24 or 25 to the East of Greenwich in the 66th or 67th degree of N lati tude when the suns altitude is about 5 at each con tact or if the suns altitude at each contact be re quired  10 the latitude of places under the same meridian must be 73 or 74 N In the former case this transit may be very advantageously observed at Tornea Kittis and the adjoining parts of Swedish Lapland in the latter at Wardhus and in the neigh bourhood of the North Cape for an error of one or two degrees either in longitude or latitude will make but333 but a very inconsiderable difference in the parallactic time as will sufficiently appear from an inspection of the following Table which contains the joint ef fect of the parallaxes of longitude and latitude in accelerating the times of the two internal contacts at Tornea Kittis and Wardhus for each of which places the parallactic

total duration at such places to which observers may conveniently be sent let us ex amine how far we may be enabled to obtain observa tions in such parts of the earths surface where the effect of parallax will be contrary and consequently where the total duration will be as short as possible By the assistance of calculation it may be found that in the latitude of about 54 South and in 155 of West longitude nearly the total duration will be the shortest when the suns altitude is 5 or in about 47 of South latitude under the same meridian when the sun is 10 high And accordingly by computing the parallactic angle for the latitude of 55 South and the meridian opposite to that of Tornea I find 4 that334 that the total duration will be shortened by parallax no less than 12 53 supposing the suns parallax  87 and consequently that there might be ob served a difference in the total duration between this place and Tornea of 24 33 a difference consider ably greater than was expected by Dr Halley in 1761 and supposing with that astronomer that the observations at each contact may be taken true to a single second which indeed experience will not warrant sufficient to determine the suns parallax within 17 5 0 th part of the whole But as this and the other point fall in the great South sea where it does not certainly appear that there is any land let us enquire in what parts of the South sea we may reasonably expect to find land From the accounts of some of the circumnavigators it should seem that there are islands scattered here and there about the tropic of Capricorn particularly the island or islands of St Peter in about 150 of W longitude from Greenwich and in about 21 of S latitude I have therefore computed the parallactic angle for a place 10h 22 50 to the West of Green wich and in 21 of S lat and find that the ingress will happen 6 10 later and the beginning of egress 6 6 sooner than if seen without parallax that the total duration is therefore shortened 12 16 by parallax and consequently that there is a difference of 23 56 in the total duration between Tornea and this island supposing the suns parallax  8 7 on the day of the transit or of 26 39 if that parallax be supposed  9 7 About the latter end of the 16th century Don Pedro Fernandez de Quiros made two voyages for the335 discovery of the southern continent and islands under the patronage of the Viceroy of Peru From several memorials which he presented to the court of Spain in the year 1609 with a view to procure a settlement of the countries he had actually discovered it appears that he had found many islands and particularly a large tract of land lying in or near the 15 of S latitude well peopled and well cultivated the inhabitants generally of a peaceable disposition The produce of this country is represented to be such as to render it a fit object to any commercial nation consisting of gold silver pearl spices of many sorts and sugarcanes He describes several safe and commodious harbours particularly Puerto de la Vera Cruz in lat 15 40 S capable of holding 1000 ships with a safe anchorage in every part and where he himself actually staid thirtysix days with three ships From the wholsomeness of the air the fertility of the soil and many other cir cumstances peculiar to this continent he makes no scruple to prefer it to every country which the Spa niards had conquered whether in the E or W In dies  I must however observe that if this country be 195 to the W of London the whole of the transit in all probability will not be visible as Venus will enter wholly upon the suns disk at or a few minutes before the time of sunrising The Spaniards gave the name of the Islands of Solomon to certain countries in the South seas re ported to be very rich in gold They were first dis covered by Alvarez de Mendoza in 1527 and are sup posed by some to be the very lands which were after wards found by Fernandez de Quiros The Spaniards  Harriss Voyages 2d Edit Vol I p 63 are336 are said to have had very clear and satisfactory accounts of these islands but to have destroyed them for po litical reaons by express orders from Old Spain when Sir Francis Drake sailed into the South seas  Their situation is not known and from some fruit less attempts to find them it has been and is still perhaps questioned whether there be any such islands  Some time after the year 1720 while Capt Betagh Commander of the Marines on board of Capt Shelvockes ship was in Peru the discovery of these islands was again attempted upon some fresh information by command of the Viceroy  but without success for the latitude of these islands is not even nearly known They are however supposed to lie between the 10th and 20th degree of S latitude in about 175 of W longitude from London accord ing to the best English and French maps or accord ing to some geographers these islands are only 120 to the W of London Soon after the government of the Dutch in the East Indies was settled at Batavia it was thought proper by the Dutch EastIndia company that an exact survey of their countries already disco vered should be made and preserved For this purpose Capt Abel Jansen Tasman sailed from Ba tavia in 1642 In this voyage several lands were discovered particularly the two islands of Amsterdam and Rotterdam lying in 21 and 20 of S latitude and in 173 or 174 of W Longitude The island ers are represented to be of a civil and peaceable dis  Harriss Voyages 2d Edit Vol I p 63  Id ib p 245 position337 position and to all appearance unacquainted with the use of arms the lands well cultivated and planted with all kinds of fruittrees   Not far from these two islands are nineteen or twenty more in 17 or 18 of S latitude and 4 or 5 to the W of the for mer Mr de Chabert in the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences for 1757  has given an account of four islands in the South sea lying in about 10 of S la titude and 134 or 135 to the West of London discovered in July 1595 by Alvaro Bendano de Neyra commander of a Spanish squadron of four ships in his second voyage for the discovery of the Solomonisles  The first and easternmost he named the Island  of Magdalene It is about six leagues in circuit  with high coasts and mountains in the middle and  is extremely well peopled More than forty In  dians came on board the ship  To the N W at the distance of about ten  leagues lies the island of St Peter near three  leagues in circuit and presenting an agreeable  prospect to the eye  About five leagues to the S W of St Peter is  another and larger island named Dominica about  fifteen leagues in circumference well peopled and  affording beautiful prospects  To the South of this island is St Christine near  eight leagues in circumference  Harriss Voyages 2d Edit Vol I p 327  Memoires de lAcademie des Sciences pour 1757 p 50 V O L LV X x The338  The whole squadron passed between this island  and Dominica and anchored in a very good ha  ven to the West of St Christine in the latitude  of 9 30 near which they found a rivulet of  very fine and fresh water The coasts of all the  islands seemed in general very safe and commodi  ous for shipping  In this harbour they found all kinds of re  freshment as fowls hogs sugarcanes plan  tanes cocoa nuts and many sorts of other fruits  They conversed with the natives of the country  and erected three crosses Besides the countries already mentioned it should seem from Mr de Lisles map of the southern he misphere that there are many islands situated be tween the parallels of 5 and 23 of South latitude in the great Pacific Ocean the most remarkable of which together with those already mentioned are given in the following Table W S Lon Lat Island of St Peter according to some maps  130 18

Prince William Islands   178 17 Terra Australis   190 15 It339 It appears I think not only possible but highly probable that observers may be stationed in the South seas I have therefore computed the parallactic angle for different longitudes and latitudes answering to such places whose positions seem to be most cer tainly known the result of which calculations is given at one view in the following Table First Second Tot eff Difference in Wlong S lat Places Names intern intern of par totdur from contact contact 8 7 Tornea         155 42 21 0 Island of St Peter 6 10 6 06 12 16 23 56 135

be stationed in any of the above places perhaps in any part of the South seas where the whole transit is visible and the total duration observed there be com pared with that at Tornea we may obtain a differ ence in time from 20 to 24 minutes which is in deed so considerable that the suns true distance must be ascertained more exactly than can possibly be ex pected from any other method But if it should be found impracticable to station an observer in the South seas the loss may in a great measure be repaired if the transit be observed in such parts of North America where the whole is visible At Mexico the total ingress will happen when the sun is very near the meridian and if the longitude of the place and the general computation may be de pended upon the beginning of egress will happen towards the time of sunset when the apparent alti tude of the sun will not much exceed four degrees X x 2 Observers340 Observers therefore should be stationed farther to the West about Cape Corientes at which place and at Mexico though in about 20 of N latitude the ef fect of parallax will still be considerable particularly at the egress as appears from the following Table First in Second Total ef

made at either of the above places or in any of the neighbouring parts with those of Tornea a difference of more than seventeen minutes in the total duration may commodiously be obtained by which the quantity of the suns parallax may be determined agreeably to the method proposed by Dr Halley in the case of the last transit and in which no error but that of the observation can take place supposing the situation of the two places to be nearly known When Dr Halleys computation was examined and it was found that so great a difference in the to tal duration of the transit at any two places as had been expected could not conveniently be obtained another method was proposed and was accordingly carried into execution viz to station two observers in such a manner that one of the internal contacts might be observed with the greatest difference possible arising from a contrary effect of parallax at the two places This method though necessarily inadequate because341 because the longitude of the two stations must be ri gorously known may be practised at both contacts in 1769 It appears by computation that the time of the first internal contact in the evening is accelerated as much as possible by parallax in 48 42 of N latitude and 6 to the East of Greenwich at or near Nancy in France But this computation is framed upon a supposition that the suns center is in the very horizon in which circumstances no observation can be taken If the suns altitude at the time of the contact should be required equal to 5 or 10 degrees then it will appear that Greenwich and Dublin are stations very advantageous and we have already seen that the time of ingress at the former place will happen 7 12 sooner than if seen from the earths center on account of parallax Indeed the effect of parallax will be nearly the same to every part of Great Bri tain The part of the earths surface where the effect of parallax upon the planet at the same contact will be as great as possible in a contrary direction when the suns altitude is about 5 is in 46 of S latitude nearly and in 168 or 169 of W longitude from London in the great Pacific Ocean where it does not at present appear that there is any land If how ever an observer should be stationed in any of the islands in the South sea for which a computation has already been made even in the islands of Mendoza the morning ingress will be found to be retarded by parallax 4 31 and consequently a difference at this contact of 11 43 may be obtained by comparing the observation of the first internal contact with the observations at Greenwich or 11 24 if the same observation be compared with that at Tornea 5 In342 In order to see the beginning of egress accelerated by the greatest effect of parallax possible when the altitude of the sun is 5 an observer must be stationed in about 123 of West longitude from London and in about 19 of S latitude or as it does not appear at present that there is land there the observer may be stationed with considerable advantage either in the islands of Mendoza or in the island of St Peter The same contact will be as much retarded on account of parallax to an observer placed under the tropic of Cancer in about 67 of E longitude from London This point indeed falls into the Gulf of Sindi but as a difference of many degrees either in longitude or latitude will occasion but a very inconsiderable dif ference in parallactic time this contact may be very advantageously observed on any part of the coast from the mouth of the Indus to Cape Comorin and from thence along the coast of Coromandel and Golconda as far as the mouth of the Ganges It may naturally be expected that the end of the transit will if the weather be favourable be observed at many of our own settlements in these parts I have therefore computed the effect of parallax at the egress for Madrass and Calcutta at which places the last transit was observed and find that the time of the second internal contact will happen 6 41 later on account of parallax at the former and 6 44 at the latter than if seen from the earths center By com paring the observations made at either of the above places with the corresponding observation at Mexico we may obtain a difference of 11 44 a difference greater than could be obtained by any observations that could conveniently be made at the egress in the transit of 1761 Upon343 Upon the whole the necessity of sending an observer into the South seas sufficiently appears whether it be proposed to determine the suns parallax by the dif ference in the total duration of the transit or by the observations of the internal contacts either at the in gress or egress For if there should happen to be no land in the meridian opposite to Tornea and in about 21 of S latitude yet if an observer can be stationed either in the islands of Mendoza or in the islands of Amsterdam and Rotterdam a difference in parallactic time will be obtained as in the following Table Difference Difference Difference Places compared in total at ingress at egress duration       Tornea and Mendoza Isles 23 00 11 24 11 36 Tornea and Amsterdam or Rotterdam 22 41 13 12 9 29 Tornea  the opp merid in 21 S lat 23 56 13 03 10 53 If the sky should prove favourable the observations made at Torena and in any of the above places will enable us to determine the suns parallax with great precision and independent of the exact knowledge of the longitude of either place But as the situation of Tornea is perhaps very exactly known if it should be convenient to the southern observer to continue long enough upon his station to determine the exact longitude of it to which the situation of Jupiter at that time will greatly contribute both methods might be practised at the same time and they would mu tually confirm and illustrate each other An opportunity of observing another transit of Venus will not again offer itself till the year 1874 It behoves us therefore to profit as much as possible by 3344 by the favourable situation of Venus in 1769 when we may be assured the several Powers of Europe will again contend which of them shall be most instru mental in contributing to the solution of this grand problem Posterity must reflect with infinite regret upon their negligence or remissness because the loss cannot be repaired by the united efforts of industry genius or power How far it may be an object of attention to a commercial nation to make a settlement in the great Pacific Ocean or to send out some ships of force with the glorious and honourble view of discovering lands towards the South pole is not my business to enquire Such enterprizes if speedily undertaken might fortunately give an advantageous position to the astronomer and add a lustre to this nation already so eminently distinguished both in arts and arms Oxford December 1 1765 I N D E X

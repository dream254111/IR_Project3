IS WITH ALL HUMILITY INSCRIBED BY THEIR HUMBLE SERVANT THOMAS HORNSBY,I206920,326 RECEIVED DECEMBER 12 1765 XXXIV ON THE TRANSIT OF VENUS IN 1769 TO THE R I G H T H O N O U R A B L E THE EARL OF M O R T O N PRESIDENT TO THE C O U N C I L AND F E L L O W S OF THE R O Y A L S O C I E T Y THIS DISCOURSE IS WITH ALL HUMILITY INSCRIBED BY THEIR HUMBLE SERVANT THOMAS HORNSBY THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE LATE TRANSIT OF VENUS THOUGH MADE WITH ALL POSSIBLE CARE AND ACCURACY HAVE NOT ENABLED US TO DETERMINE WITH CERTAINTY THE REAL QUANTITY OF THE SUNS PARALLAX SINCE BY A COMPARISON OF THE OBSERVATIONS MADE IN SEVERAL PARTS OF THE GLOBE THE SUNS PARALLAX IS NOT LESS THAN 812 NOR DOES IT SEEM TO EXCEED 10 FROM THE LABOURS OF THOSE GENTLEMEN WHO HAVE 1 ATTEMPTED READ FEB 13 1766327 ATTEMPTED TO DEDUCE THIS QUANTITY FROM THE THEORY OF GRAVITY IT SHOULD SEEM THAT THE EARTH PERFORMS ITS ANNUAL REVOLUTION ROUND THE SUN AT A GREATER DISTANCE THAN IS GENERALLY IMAGINED SINCE MR PRO FESSOR STEWART HAS DETERMINED THE SUNS PARALLAX TO BE ONLY 6 9 AND MR MAYER THE LATE CELEBRATED PROFESSOR AT GOTTINGEN WHO HATH BROUGHT THE LUNAR TABLES TO A DEGREE OF PERFECTION ALMOST UNEXPECTED IS OF OPINION THAT IT CANNOT EXCEED 8  IN THIS UNCERTAINTY THE ASTRONOMERS OF THE PRESENT AGE ARE PECULIARLY FORTUNATE IN BEING ABLE SO SOON TO HAVE RECOURSE TO ANOTHER TRANSIT OF VENUS IN 1769 WHEN ON ACCOUNT OF THAT PLANETS NORTH LATITUDE A DIFFERENCE IN THE TOTAL DURATION MAY CONVENIENTLY BE OBSERVED GREATER THAN COULD POSSIBLY BE OBTAINED OR WAS EVEN EXPECTED BY DR HALLEY FROM THE LAST TRANSIT THE EXPERIENCE WHICH WE GAINED IN THE YEAR 1761 THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE ERRORS FROM WHATEVER CAUSE THEY MAY ARISE WHICH MUST UNAVOIDABLY BE COMMITTED IN OBSERVATIONS OF THIS KIND WILL ENABLE US TO PUT IN PRACTICE EVERY METHOD OF SOLVING THIS PROBLEM AND TO DETERMINE WITH WHAT DEGREE OF AC CURACY AND WITHIN WHAT LIMITS THE TRUE QUANTITY OF THE SUNS PARALLAX MAY BE OBTAINED AND CONSEQUENTLY THE DIMENSIONS OF THE WHOLE SOLAR SYSTEM BUT BEFORE I PROCEED TO GIVE A COMPUTATION OF THE EFFECT OF PARALLAX AT THE SEVERAL PLACES WHERE THIS TRANSIT OUGHT TO BE OBSERVED IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO PRE MISE THE PRINCIPLES UPON WHICH THE GENERAL CALCULUS WAS  MR MACHIN PROFESSOR OF ASTRONOMY AT GRESHAM COLLEGE DEDUCED THE SAME QUANTITY MANY YEARS AGO SEE A TRACT ENTITLED THE LAWS OF THE MOONS MOTION ACCORDING TO GRAVITY P 24 FORMED328 FORMED HAVING FOUND BY COMPUTING THE OBSERVA TIONS MADE ON THE TRANSIT IN 1761 THAT WHEN THE ABBE DE LA CAILLES SOLAR TABLES ARE USED THE EPOCH OF THE MEAN MOTION OF VENUS FOR 1761 AS GIVEN IN DR HALLEYS TABLES REQUIRES A CORRECTION OF  52 12 AND THAT THE PLACE OF THE ASCENDING NODE WAS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SAME YEAR IN 2 14 31 10 HAVING COLLECTED ALSO BY COMPUTING THE OBSERVATIONS OF MR HORROX IN 1639 WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF DR HALLEYS TABLES OF VENUS AND THE SOLAR TABLES ABOVE MENTIONED THAT THE MOTION OF THE PLANETS MEAN LONGITUDE IS 6 19 12 22 AND OF THE NODE 52 18 IN 100 JULIAN YEARS I HAVE SUPPOSED THE MEAN LONGITUDE OF VENUS IN THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR 1769 TO 0 5 23 48 AND THE PLACE OF THE NODE TO BE IN 2 14 35 21 AND HAVE ASSUMED THE REST OF THE PLANETS ELEMENTS AS GIVEN IN DR HAL LEYS TABLES ACCORDING TO THESE NUMBERS AND THE ABBE DE LA CAILLES SOLAR TABLES THE ECLIPTIC CONJUNCTION WILL HAPPEN ON JUNE 3D 1769 AT 9H 59 24 MEAN TIME AT GREENWICH THE PLANETS GEOCENTRIC LATI TUDE BEING 10 13 5 N THE LOG OF THE EARTHS DISTANCE FROM THE SUN  50065166 THE LOG OF VENUSS DISTANCE FROM THE SUN  48610947 AND OF THE PLANETS DISTANCE FROM THE EARTH  44606784 AND THE EQUATION OF THE PRAECESSION OF THE EQUINOCTIAL POINTS   177 BY COMPUTING THE GEOCENTRIC LONGITUDE AND LATITUDE OF THE PLANET THREE HOURS BE FORE AND THREE HOURS AFTER THE ECLIPTIC CONJUNCTION I FIND THE PLANETS HOURLY MOTION FROM THE SUN IN THE ECLIPTIC  3 57 7 THE HOURLY MOTION IN THE RE LATIVE ORBIT  4 0 3 THE HOURLY MOTION IN LATI TUDE  0 35 45 THE ANGLE OF THE PLANETS PATH WITH329 WITH THE ECLIPTIC  8 29 02 THE ANGLE OF THE ECLIPTIC WITH THE EQUATOR  7 02 54 AND THERE FORE THE ANGLE MADE BY THE PLANETS VISIBLE PATH WITH THE EQUATOR  15 31 56 THE GEOCENTRIC LATI TUDE IS AS HAS BEEN OBSERVED  10 13 5 AND HENCE IT IS EASILY DETERMINED THAT THE LEAST DISTANCE OF THE CENTERS WILL BE 10 06 8 AND THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THE TIME OF THE ECLIPTIC CONJUNCTION AND THE MIDDLE OF THE TRANSIT  22 21 OF TIME AS THE PLANET HAS NOT YET PASSED ITS NODE THE MIDDLE OF THE TRANSIT WILL THEREFORE BE AT 10H 21 45 MEAN TIME AT GREENWICH IN EVERY INFERIOR CONJUNCTION THE MOTION OF VENUS IS RETROGRADE AND THEREFORE THE EFFECT OF THE ABERRATION OF LIGHT IN LONG  37 WHEN REDUCED TO TIME  55 IS TO ACCELERATE THE SEVERAL PHASES OF THE TRANSIT THE EQUATED MEAN TIME OF THE MIDDLE THEREFORE WILL BE AT 10H 20 50 BUT THE PLACE OF THE PLANET IS ALSO AFFECTED BY THE ABERRATION OF LIGHT IN LATITUDE AND AS VENUSS LATI TUDE IS DECREASING THE LEAST DISTANCE OF THE CENTERS WILL BE INCREASED BY 1 35 THE EQUATED LEAST DISTANCE OF THE CENTERS THEREFORE WILL BE 10 08 15 NOW SUPPOSING THE SEMIDIAMETER OF THE SUN  15 456 AND OF VENUS  29 THE SEMI DURATIONS OR INTERVALS BETWEEN THE MIDDLE AND THE EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL CONTACTS WILL BE FOUND  3H 10 08 5 AND 2H 51 132 THE EQUATION OF TIME IS ABOUT 2 14 AT THE MIDDLE OF THE TRANSIT BY WHICH QUANTITY THE APPARENT TIME IS BEFORE THE MEAN AND DECREASES AT THE RATE OF ABOUT 2 IN 6 HOURS THEREFORE THE APPARENT TIMES OF THE SEVERAL PHASES OF THIS TRANSIT FOR THE MERIDIAN OF GREENWICH ARE AS FOLLOWS VOL LV U U FIRST330 APP TIME H   FIRST EXTERNAL CONTACT JUNE 3 7 12 56 TOTAL INGRESS   7 31 52 MIDDLE    10 23 04 BEGINNING OF EGRESS   13 14 16 LAST CONTACT   13 33 11 HITHERTO WE HAVE HAD NO REGARD TO PARALLAX AND THE ABOVE TIMES ARE SUCH AS WOULD BE OBSERVED FROM THE EARTHS CENTER TO THE BRITISH ISLES AND TO THE NEIGHBOURING PARTS OF THE CONTINENT THE EFFECT OF PARALLAX IS NEARLY AT A MAXIMUM AND WILL CONSIDER ABLY ACCELERATE THE TIMES OF EXTERNAL CONTACT AND IN GRESS IF WE SUPPOSE THE SUNS PARALLAX ON THE DAY OF THE TRANSIT  87 THE HORIZONTAL PARALLAX OF VENUS FROM THE SUN WILL BE 2187 AND THE TIMES OF THE EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL CONTACTS VISIBLE IN ENGLAND WILL BE ACCELERATED BY THE JOINT EFFECTS OF PARALLAX BOTH IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PLANETS PATH AND PERPENDICULAR TO IT THE FORMER BY 7 09 THE LATTER BY 7 12 AND THEREFORE VENUS WILL BE SEEN TO TOUCH THE SUNS LIMB AT 7H 5 47 MORE THAN AN HOUR BEFORE THE TIME OF SUNSET WHEN THE APPARENT ALTITUDE OF THE PLANET ABOVE THE HORIZON WILL BE ABOUT 8 DEGREES AND THE TOTAL INGRESS WILL HAPPEN AT 7H 24 40 WHEN THE PLANETS ALTITUDE WILL EXCEED 5 DEGREES IF THE SUNS PARALLAX SHOULD BE ONE SECOND LARGER THAN WE HAVE SUPPOSED OR 97 THE TIME OF INGRESS WILL HAPPEN AT 7H 23 51 THESE TIMES ARE NOT HERE GIVEN WITH ANY GREAT DE GREE OF CONFIDENCE BUT AS THE ERRORS IN THE PLANETS ORBIT WILL IN JUNE 1769 BE NEARLY THE SAME WITH THOSE331 THOSE WHICH WERE OBSERVED 8 YEARS BEFORE IT MAY BE PRESUMED THAT THE FOREGOING COMPUTATION WILL BE FOUND NOT TO DIFFER VERY WIDELY FROM THE TRUTH HAVING RECTIFIED THE GLOBE TO THE DECLINATION OF THE SUN AT THE MIDDLE OF THE TRANSIT22 26 40 AND ALSO AT THE TIMES OF THE TWO INTERNAL CONTACTS I FIND THAT THE WHOLE TRANSIT WILL BE VISIBLE TO A CONSIDERABLE PART OF SWEDISH LAPLAND THE NORTHERNMOST PARTS OF ASIA AND THE NORTHERN AND N W PARTS OF NORTH AMERICA FOR THE CIRCLE OF ILLUMINATION AT THE FIRST INTERNAL CON TACT PASSES ALONG THE WESTERN COAST OF AFRICA FROM CAPE VERD THROUGH THE STRAITS OF GIBRALTAR TO CLER MONT IN FRANCE LEAVING PARIS ABOUT A DEGREE AND A HALF TO THE WEST FROM THENCE IT PASSES THROUGH GERMANY AND ALONG THE BALTIC GULF THROUGH WI BOURG AND ARCHANGEL ALONG THE NORTHERN COAST OF ASIA AND THEN TRAVERSING THE N E PARTS OF SIBERIA IT PASSES OVER JAPAN ENTERS THE GREAT ATLANTIC OCEAN LEAVES THE MARIAN ISLES AND NEW ZEALAND ON THE WEST AND RUNNING ROUND CAPE HORN AND NEAR FALKLAND ISLE PASSES ON TO CAPE VERD THROUGH THE ETHIOPIC OCEAN IN A DIRECTION NEARLY PARALLEL TO THE EASTERN COAST OF SOUTH AMERICA ALL PLACES SITUATED UNDER THE FIRST PART OF THIS LINE FROM NOVA ZEMBLA TOWARDS CAPE HORN WILL SEE VENUS ENTER UPON THE SUN AT THE TIME OF SUNSETTING AND AT SUNRISING UN DER THE OTHER HALF OF IT THE CIRCLE OF ILLUMINATION AT THE BEGINNING OF EGRESS ENTERS EUROPE TO THE NORTH OF DRONTHEIM IN NORWAY AND CROSSING THE BOTHNIC AND FINLAND GULFS PASSES OVER MUSCOVY AND THE CASPIAN SEA AND RUNNING THROUGH PERSIA TRAVERSES THE ARABIAN GULF GOING SOUTHWARD NEAR THE ISLES OF MAL DIVIA AND TAKING A LARGE CIRCUIT TOWARDS THE SOUTH U U 2 POLE332 POLE RETURNS THROUGH MEXICO LOUISIANA CANADA AND THE SOUTHERN PARTS OF GREENLAND TO DRONTHEIM SO THAT ALMOST ALL AFRICA IS DEPRIVED OF A VIEW OF THIS TRANSIT AND A VERY CONSIDERABLE PART OF EUROPE IF WE EXAMINE THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE TRANSIT IN 1761 IN PLACES WHERE THERE WERE MORE OBSERVERS THAN ONE AND WHERE THE CONTACTS WERE OBSERVED WHEN THE SUN WAS NEAR THE HORIZON AND AT HIGHER ALTITUDES WE MAY SAFELY CONCLUDE THAT THE OBSERVATIONS WILL BE MADE WITH SUFFICIENT ACCURACY WHEN THE SUN IS AT SUCH ALTITUDES ABOVE THE HORIZON AS NOT TO BE GREATLY AFFECTED BY THE VAPOURS AT THE OBSERVATORY AT UPSAL WHEN THE SUNS ALTITUDE AT THE INGRESS WAS 3 12 DEGREES THREE OBSERVERS DIFFERED 22 WHEREAS AT THE EGRESS WHEN THE SUN WAS 4414 HIGH THE DIFFERENCE AMOUNTED ONLY TO 6 IT SHOULD SEEM THEREFORE THAT OBSERVERS OUGHT NOT TO BE SENT TO PLACES WHERE THE SUN WILL BE MUCH LESS THAN 5 HIGH AT THE TIME OF EITHER OF THE CONTACTS IT APPEARS BY COMPUTATION THAT THE JOINT EFFECT OF THE PARALLAXES BOTH IN LONGITUDE AND LATITUDE TO LENGTHEN THE TOTAL DURATION WILL BE THE GREATEST TO THOSE PLACES WHICH ARE ABOUT 24 OR 25 TO THE EAST OF GREENWICH IN THE 66TH OR 67TH DEGREE OF N LATI TUDE WHEN THE SUNS ALTITUDE IS ABOUT 5 AT EACH CON TACT OR IF THE SUNS ALTITUDE AT EACH CONTACT BE RE QUIRED  10 THE LATITUDE OF PLACES UNDER THE SAME MERIDIAN MUST BE 73 OR 74 N IN THE FORMER CASE THIS TRANSIT MAY BE VERY ADVANTAGEOUSLY OBSERVED AT TORNEA KITTIS AND THE ADJOINING PARTS OF SWEDISH LAPLAND IN THE LATTER AT WARDHUS AND IN THE NEIGH BOURHOOD OF THE NORTH CAPE FOR AN ERROR OF ONE OR TWO DEGREES EITHER IN LONGITUDE OR LATITUDE WILL MAKE BUT333 BUT A VERY INCONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCE IN THE PARALLACTIC TIME AS WILL SUFFICIENTLY APPEAR FROM AN INSPECTION OF THE FOLLOWING TABLE WHICH CONTAINS THE JOINT EF FECT OF THE PARALLAXES OF LONGITUDE AND LATITUDE IN ACCELERATING THE TIMES OF THE TWO INTERNAL CONTACTS AT TORNEA KITTIS AND WARDHUS FOR EACH OF WHICH PLACES THE PARALLACTIC

TOTAL DURATION AT SUCH PLACES TO WHICH OBSERVERS MAY CONVENIENTLY BE SENT LET US EX AMINE HOW FAR WE MAY BE ENABLED TO OBTAIN OBSERVA TIONS IN SUCH PARTS OF THE EARTHS SURFACE WHERE THE EFFECT OF PARALLAX WILL BE CONTRARY AND CONSEQUENTLY WHERE THE TOTAL DURATION WILL BE AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE BY THE ASSISTANCE OF CALCULATION IT MAY BE FOUND THAT IN THE LATITUDE OF ABOUT 54 SOUTH AND IN 155 OF WEST LONGITUDE NEARLY THE TOTAL DURATION WILL BE THE SHORTEST WHEN THE SUNS ALTITUDE IS 5 OR IN ABOUT 47 OF SOUTH LATITUDE UNDER THE SAME MERIDIAN WHEN THE SUN IS 10 HIGH AND ACCORDINGLY BY COMPUTING THE PARALLACTIC ANGLE FOR THE LATITUDE OF 55 SOUTH AND THE MERIDIAN OPPOSITE TO THAT OF TORNEA I FIND 4 THAT334 THAT THE TOTAL DURATION WILL BE SHORTENED BY PARALLAX NO LESS THAN 12 53 SUPPOSING THE SUNS PARALLAX  87 AND CONSEQUENTLY THAT THERE MIGHT BE OB SERVED A DIFFERENCE IN THE TOTAL DURATION BETWEEN THIS PLACE AND TORNEA OF 24 33 A DIFFERENCE CONSIDER ABLY GREATER THAN WAS EXPECTED BY DR HALLEY IN 1761 AND SUPPOSING WITH THAT ASTRONOMER THAT THE OBSERVATIONS AT EACH CONTACT MAY BE TAKEN TRUE TO A SINGLE SECOND WHICH INDEED EXPERIENCE WILL NOT WARRANT SUFFICIENT TO DETERMINE THE SUNS PARALLAX WITHIN 17 5 0 TH PART OF THE WHOLE BUT AS THIS AND THE OTHER POINT FALL IN THE GREAT SOUTH SEA WHERE IT DOES NOT CERTAINLY APPEAR THAT THERE IS ANY LAND LET US ENQUIRE IN WHAT PARTS OF THE SOUTH SEA WE MAY REASONABLY EXPECT TO FIND LAND FROM THE ACCOUNTS OF SOME OF THE CIRCUMNAVIGATORS IT SHOULD SEEM THAT THERE ARE ISLANDS SCATTERED HERE AND THERE ABOUT THE TROPIC OF CAPRICORN PARTICULARLY THE ISLAND OR ISLANDS OF ST PETER IN ABOUT 150 OF W LONGITUDE FROM GREENWICH AND IN ABOUT 21 OF S LATITUDE I HAVE THEREFORE COMPUTED THE PARALLACTIC ANGLE FOR A PLACE 10H 22 50 TO THE WEST OF GREEN WICH AND IN 21 OF S LAT AND FIND THAT THE INGRESS WILL HAPPEN 6 10 LATER AND THE BEGINNING OF EGRESS 6 6 SOONER THAN IF SEEN WITHOUT PARALLAX THAT THE TOTAL DURATION IS THEREFORE SHORTENED 12 16 BY PARALLAX AND CONSEQUENTLY THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE OF 23 56 IN THE TOTAL DURATION BETWEEN TORNEA AND THIS ISLAND SUPPOSING THE SUNS PARALLAX  8 7 ON THE DAY OF THE TRANSIT OR OF

PATRONAGE OF THE VICEROY OF PERU FROM SEVERAL MEMORIALS WHICH HE PRESENTED TO THE COURT OF SPAIN IN THE YEAR 1609 WITH A VIEW TO PROCURE A SETTLEMENT OF THE COUNTRIES HE HAD ACTUALLY DISCOVERED IT APPEARS THAT HE HAD FOUND MANY ISLANDS AND PARTICULARLY A LARGE TRACT OF LAND LYING IN OR NEAR THE 15 OF S LATITUDE WELL PEOPLED AND WELL CULTIVATED THE INHABITANTS GENERALLY OF A PEACEABLE

DAYS WITH THREE SHIPS FROM THE WHOLSOMENESS OF THE AIR THE FERTILITY OF THE SOIL AND MANY OTHER CIR CUMSTANCES PECULIAR TO THIS CONTINENT HE MAKES NO SCRUPLE TO PREFER IT TO EVERY COUNTRY WHICH THE SPA NIARDS HAD CONQUERED WHETHER IN THE E OR W IN DIES  I MUST HOWEVER OBSERVE THAT IF THIS COUNTRY BE 195 TO THE W OF LONDON THE WHOLE OF THE TRANSIT IN ALL PROBABILITY WILL NOT BE VISIBLE AS VENUS WILL ENTER WHOLLY UPON THE SUNS DISK AT OR A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THE TIME OF SUNRISING THE SPANIARDS GAVE THE NAME OF THE ISLANDS OF SOLOMON TO CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN THE SOUTH SEAS RE PORTED TO BE VERY

QUANTITY OF THE SUNS PARALLAX MAY BE DETERMINED AGREEABLY TO THE METHOD PROPOSED BY DR HALLEY IN THE CASE OF THE LAST TRANSIT AND IN WHICH NO ERROR BUT THAT OF THE OBSERVATION CAN TAKE PLACE SUPPOSING THE SITUATION OF THE TWO PLACES TO BE NEARLY KNOWN WHEN DR HALLEYS COMPUTATION WAS EXAMINED AND IT WAS FOUND THAT SO GREAT A DIFFERENCE IN THE TO TAL DURATION OF THE TRANSIT AT ANY TWO PLACES AS HAD

TWO STATIONS MUST BE RI GOROUSLY KNOWN MAY BE PRACTISED AT BOTH CONTACTS IN 1769 IT APPEARS BY COMPUTATION THAT THE TIME OF THE FIRST INTERNAL CONTACT IN THE EVENING IS ACCELERATED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BY PARALLAX IN 48 42 OF N LATITUDE AND 6 TO THE EAST OF GREENWICH AT OR NEAR NANCY IN FRANCE BUT THIS COMPUTATION IS FRAMED UPON A SUPPOSITION THAT THE SUNS CENTER IS IN THE VERY HORIZON IN WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES NO OBSERVATION CAN BE TAKEN IF THE SUNS ALTITUDE AT THE TIME OF THE CONTACT SHOULD BE REQUIRED EQUAL TO 5 OR 10 DEGREES THEN IT WILL APPEAR THAT GREENWICH AND DUBLIN ARE STATIONS VERY ADVANTAGEOUS AND WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN THAT THE TIME OF INGRESS AT THE FORMER PLACE WILL HAPPEN 7 12 SOONER THAN IF SEEN FROM THE EARTHS CENTER ON ACCOUNT OF PARALLAX INDEED THE EFFECT OF PARALLAX WILL

THEREFORE COMPUTED THE EFFECT OF PARALLAX AT THE EGRESS FOR MADRASS AND CALCUTTA AT WHICH PLACES THE LAST TRANSIT WAS OBSERVED AND FIND THAT THE TIME OF THE SECOND INTERNAL CONTACT WILL HAPPEN 6 41 LATER ON ACCOUNT OF PARALLAX AT THE FORMER AND 6 44 AT THE LATTER THAN IF SEEN FROM THE EARTHS CENTER BY COM PARING THE OBSERVATIONS MADE AT EITHER OF THE ABOVE PLACES WITH THE CORRESPONDING

TRANSIT OR BY THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE INTERNAL CONTACTS EITHER AT THE IN GRESS OR EGRESS FOR IF THERE SHOULD HAPPEN TO BE NO LAND IN THE MERIDIAN OPPOSITE TO TORNEA AND IN ABOUT 21 OF S LATITUDE YET

INDEPENDENT OF THE EXACT KNOWLEDGE OF THE LONGITUDE OF EITHER PLACE BUT AS THE SITUATION OF TORNEA IS PERHAPS VERY EXACTLY KNOWN IF IT SHOULD BE CONVENIENT TO THE SOUTHERN OBSERVER TO CONTINUE LONG ENOUGH UPON HIS STATION TO DETERMINE THE EXACT LONGITUDE OF IT TO WHICH THE SITUATION OF JUPITER AT THAT TIME WILL GREATLY CONTRIBUTE BOTH METHODS MIGHT BE PRACTISED AT THE SAME TIME AND THEY WOULD MU TUALLY CONFIRM AND ILLUSTRATE EACH OTHER AN OPPORTUNITY OF OBSERVING ANOTHER TRANSIT OF VENUS WILL NOT AGAIN OFFER ITSELF TILL THE YEAR 1874 IT BEHOVES US THEREFORE TO PROFIT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BY 3344 BY THE FAVOURABLE SITUATION OF VENUS IN 1769 WHEN WE MAY BE ASSURED THE SEVERAL POWERS OF EUROPE WILL AGAIN CONTEND WHICH OF THEM SHALL BE MOST INSTRU MENTAL IN CONTRIBUTING TO THE SOLUTION OF

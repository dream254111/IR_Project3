Professor Hobbs presents a portion of his results obtained in work for the U S Geological Survey in the Connecticut region see 2ist Annual Report U S Geological Sur vey Part III I9O1 pp II62 His theme in this article is to show the relation between stream course and the joint and fault planes Hobbs points out that the tendency of the modern school of physiographers seems to be to ascribe little importance to geo logical structure planes as a factor in determining the position and the orientation of watercourses He calls attention also to the fact that at an earlier period there was a tendency to assign marked importance to this possible cause of stream course He calls particular attention to the fact that the Norwegian geologists Kjerulf and Br6gger find a marked relationship between stream course and fault fissures In describing the south Norway region Brogger for example remarks that as a final result of his observa tions in the region he finds that almost every valley every cleft is formed along a fault fissure With this introduction Hobbs proceeds to a consideration of the Connecticut region which he has studied with especial care in the Pomperaug valley It is a wellknown fact that the JuraTrias Newark strata of the eastern United States are complexly faulted and that these faults extend into the underlying and surrounding metamorphics in which of course it is much more difficult to trace the faults than in the areas of sedimentary strata The detailed study which Hobbs has given to the Pomperaug valley has developed the fact that a complex system made up of intersecting series of par allel nearly vertical joints and faults there divides the crust into a large number of orographic blocks the smaller of which have dimensions of less than one hundred paces He further remarks It was found in studying the area that the streams large and small for considerable distances adhere with great fidelity to the directions of some of the prevailing faults and that in many cases after being diverted from them it was noted that they had returned persistently to the old direction This correspondence of drainage lines to geological structure planes is far too close to be accidental 416Physiographic Notes Extending the study beyond the limited area which he has exam ined carefully Hobbs has traced maps of the Connecticut drainage from the United States Geological Survey charts and upon them marked a theoretical extension of the fault planes observed in the Pomperaug area These maps certainly develop a striking orienta tion of the streams in coincidence with the theoretical direction of the faulted areas But the weak points in the paper are the failure to consider other explanations such as superimposition and the extremely hypothetical nature of the evidence outside of the Pom peraug valley The peculiarities of the drainage of southern Connecticut have long been a puzzle to physiographers but Hobbss study furnishes us a possible explanation of this peculiar drainage His hypothesis is well worthy the careful consideration of physiographers and if further detailed study of crystalline rocks of Connecticut reveal as close parallelism between stream course and structure planes as seems to be the case in the Pomperaug valley area it will introduce to physiographers an element which many of the American school have been quite apt to consider unimportant The lesson supplied by the Far West and elsewhere has tended to lead us to believe that fault plains have had very slight influence on stream course and it will require very complete evidence to offset this view Abundance of joint planes on the other hand are known in a num ber of cases to have had an influence on the direction of stream course Is it not perhaps the influence of joint planes rather than of faulting that accounts for the phenomena to which Hobbs has called attention  RECENT PAPERS BY PROFESSOR DAvISIn a paper read before the 7th International Geographical Congress in 1899 Sonderab druck aus den Verhandlungen des VII Internationalen Geographen Kongresses in Berlin i899 pp 221231 Professor Davis makes a clear statement of his views upon the geographical cycle which are so well known to American students One of the important points which he makes in this paper is that geographers in their studies which accompany travel should add to mere description an appre ciation of the scientific aspects of geography This point he states in the following words Geographers have been too long content to work without the aid of the faculties of imagination invention deduction and verification whose exercise has been found so highly advantageous to the progress of other sciences If the adoption of the scheme of the geographical cycle will lead the geographer to think more it will cer tainly not cause him to see less Owing to a too great reliance on observation alone 417Physiographic Notes geographers have left to their allies the geologists and the biologists who are more skilled in methods of scientific investigation the discovery of the two most important general principles that are today involved in geographical study one being the evolution of landforms and the other the devolution of organic forms Is it not then now incumbent on geographers at least to make active application of these principles and of the methods by which they were discovered  As a fair example of the kind of discussion which the foregoing paper proposes reference may be made to Professor Daviss own paper describing an excursion in Bosnia Herzegovina and Dalmatia Bulletin Geographical Society of Philadelphia Vol III No 2 Feb I9go This paper is a popular description of an experience which Professor Davis had in 1897 on an excursion with Professor Penck of the University of Vienna It is as interesting as most accounts of travel though lacking the grotesque features which so often mar such attempts at scientific description Yet notwith standing its interesting and popular nature the paper is full of valuable information and deduction from scientific observations Another illustration of Professor Daviss methodfar less popu lar however but of its kind a perfect illustrationis his recent paper describing An Excursion to the Grand Canyon of the Colo rado Bull Museum Comparative Zoology Vol XXXVIII I90o pp 107201 It is difficult to summarize Professor Daviss care ful analysis but in general it may be said that he agrees in the main with the conclusions of earlier workers though differing from them in his interpretation of some of the minor details He also finds from his study that some of the interpretations of observed fact are not necessary One important result of his study is his statement of the evidence indicating that the Colorado is not in any marked degree an antecedent river but rather one of conse quent origin In this connection he says The Colorado itself may be in part antecedent to some of the many dislocations that the district has suffered but it seems to be for the most part consequent on the dis placements caused by faulting in the later part of the great denudation and on the form that the surface had assumed at that time Professor Davis notes the bearing of certain facts in the Colo rado Cafion on the question of glacial erosion He and others have held that side valleys tributary to a main stream and entering at a higher level are in the case of the Alps Norway and some other regions indication of glacial erosion These highlevel tributary valleys have been given the name of hanging valleys Some students of the subject have held that these hanging valleys are the normal result of the more rapid deepening of the main valley by the larger stream thus leaving the tributary valleys behind in the work of 418Physiographic Notes erosion so that their bottoms are now high above the bed of the main stream Professor Davis pointedly says that if this view is correct then surely the discordance of side and main valleys ought to be very strong in the Grand Canyon where there is no question of glacial erosion where the disparity of volume between trunk river and side streams is notoriously great and where the main valley is still so young that no significant widening of its floor has been yet accomplished Yet singularly enough the side canyons of the Colorado join the main canyon at accordant levels in nearly all cases We have come to expect from Professor Davis the introduction of new geographical names and descriptive terms in his publica tions and in the paper under consideration this expectation is not disappointed While most of his terms are sound and descriptive it seems to some physiographers rather questionable whether new names are not multiplying with altogether too great rapidity Already the time has come when no one but a trained physiographer can read the literature intelligently There is actual need of a glos sary of physiographic terms The introduction of this great mass of names must tend to interfere with the very object which Pro fessor Davis has in his appeal to geographers to adopt more scien tific methods for it is plainly evident that without an extensive reading of the whole literature the new physiography with its varied terms is almost inaccessible to the geographer No one will question the desirability of introducing a new term when one is actually demanded but to introduce them in advance of such a need as Professor Davis has done in his diagram on page 193 really seems uncalled for and of questionable value Even a trained physiographer unless he has a strong leaning toward classification must recoil from the task of learning the proper use of the follow ing names which are marked in Professor Daviss diagram fig 17 page 193 Splitting ravine peakheaded ravine saddleheaded ravine ridgeheaded ravine left basal ravine right basal ravine right side ravine forking valley split

others the Basin Ranges owe their peculiar forms in large part to faulting but some workers notably Dana have dissented from this view which is based largely upon physiographic evidence Spurr Bull Geol Soc Amer Vol XII 1901 pp 217 270 basing his conclusions on a study of the literature and of parts of the field strongly dissents from the common interpretation of 419Physiographic Notes faulting for he does not see in the physiography of the region suf ficient proof that the form is to be ascribed to this origin Instead of persistent monoclinal ridges he finds that the mountains almost invariably merge into folds Faults that are ascertainable accord ing to his viewsthat is faults in this region that are proved by stratigraphic evidenceare not in general associated with mountain fronts In fact where faults are present near the mountain front they are rarely attended by fault scarps but on the contrary the steep mountain faces appear to be due to erosion From his studies he considers the features of the Basin Ranges to be natural and normal results of erosion of the folded rocks Their present form is the result of denudation which has been in operation since Jurassic time The older faults of the region are obscured byero sion and new ones only are expressed in the topography The question which Spurr thus raises is most interesting and worthy of careful future study It is evident from what he has to say that the work of previous observers in this region has not been published in sufficient detail to support the broad conclusions which have been drawn from it with force enough to convince the writer of the paper The reconnaissance nature of the work done in this field may perhaps account for this difficulty It seems fairly certain however that there has not been a sufficiently critical study of the physiographic evidence to warrant the acceptance of faulting as an established explanation But further than this it seems impossible to go for as Professor Davis has clearly and vigorously stated in his review of Spurrs paper Science Vol XIV 1901 p 457 Spurr on the other hand has equally failed to establish his own thesis because he has failed to discuss critically and disprove the evidence of a physiographic nature which previous observers have put forth In fact he does not appear to have a proper appre ciation of the independent value of physiographic evidence since faults inferred by such evidence are not considered by him as hav ing proper foundation There ought in America to be no ques tion at this time concerning the value of purely physiographic evi dence Doubtless in the enthusiasm for this youngest branch of geology its votaries have in some cases made it carry too heavy a burden but these are merely mistakes of individuals The princi ples of physiography itself have become so well established that when a discussion is undertaken in which some of the facts are in the nature of physiographic evidence it has come to be necessary to consider them as carefully as if they were stratigraphic or petro graphic evidence It is in his failure to recognize this fact that 420Physiographic Notes Spurrs paper is weak and it is because of this weakness that his conclusions cannot be accepted as proved They may be correct but further consideration of the physiographic evidence is neces sary before his contention can be considered established LANDSLIPS IN NORWAYReusch Norges Geologiske Under sogelse No 32 Aarbog for I900 describes some interesting land slips which occurred in Norway some years ago In the Vaerdal landslip of May I893 in which fully 55000000 cubic metres slid into the valley of a small stream the stream had been cutting against a clay bank in which there was  quick  clay beneath the soil The action of the stream in lateral erosion caused numerous small slides and the movement culminated at midnight on the Igth of May with the great slide which killed III people and dammed up the stream forming a lake with an area of three square kilo metres In the same vicinity a great landslide occurred three years before Farther up stream in the same year there occurred a peculiar change in the river At one point the stream was flowing in a cut over rock at the base of which it turned sharply at right angles cut ting against a bluff of marine clay which separated the lower course of the river from the upper course above the rock barrier By cut ting and weathering the clay barrier between the two sections of the stream was so lowered and narrowed that there was evident danger of the stream taking that channel and abandoning its rock valley In consequence of this danger it was proposed to strengthen the clay barrier but before anything was done during a time of flood the water in the upper course of the river spilled over the clay divide at first as a tiny stream then in the course of an hour as a roaring muddy torrent which quickly cut so deep into the clay that the rock section of the valley was abandoned This of course lowered the grade of the stream which had previously been held back by the rocky barrier and the river began rapidly to deepen its valley up stream and at the same time the side streams near their mouths began to cut narrow gorges in the clay beds The result was that in a short time the old broadbottomed valley was transformed to a canon and the side valleys became young in form By pictures and a series of drawings Reusch illustrates the develop ment of the cafion condition up stream and one picture shows strik ingly what a tremendous change took place where in order to pass from one side of the valley to the other instead of going by even grade as formerly it had become necessary to travel across from 421Physiographic Notes one side of the old floodplain to the other in a cage suspended from wire ropes With this rejuvenation of the stream valley owing to the steep slopes numerous landslides naturally occurred as the clay slipped and by this means farms were destroyed and roads ruined Reusch points out that this case well illustrates on a small and rapid scale what would happen in the elevation and consequent rejuvena tion of a stream system upon a coastal plain SOME TOPOGRAPHIC FEATURES OF NORWAYIn the same Aar bog in which the above account of landslides is given is an inter esting interpretation of the topography of portions of Norway There is much detailed description of individual fjords valleys and falls accompanied with interpretation of their origin and illustrated by numerous clearlymade sketches The high plateaux are inter preted as peneplains not being due to marine denudation as is the case in some of the lower coastal plains such for example as that near Bergen Of the many sounds inlets etc near Bergen some are due to the action of the sea and many of them owe their position to struc ture and joint planes In accounting for the fjords Reusch agrees in part with Professor Davis that the hanging valleys which enter on the side at levels well above the fjord bottom and even in some cases fully half a mile above the present sealevel are an indication of glacial erosion but he states that he cannot agree that the fjords have been entirely formed by glacial erosion Norway was once apparently higher than at present and water action must be in part invoked to account for the phenomena Some fjords show signs of complex origin in which interglacial water erosion and several periods of glacial erosion are involved The glaciers in moving down these valleys not merely enlarged them but also partly destroyed the side valleys by wearing back the sides of the main fjord valley Owing to the rather full English summary that is in the back part of the volume these physiographic and geological articles are ren dered accessible to Englishspeaking students THE ANDES OF PATAGONIAPartly due to the attempted settle ment of the boundary dispute between Chile and Argentina the literature on the hitherto littleknown Patagonia has of late been decidedly increased One of the latest accounts of importance is by Gallois Les Andes de Patagonie Annales de Geographie tome X 190o The article contains much interesting description of 422Physiographic Notes surface features and is illustrated by a series of splendid panoramas in which are shown the grander features of topographythe rugged mountains with their waste slopes and extensive snow fields and glaciers It is also illustrated by a new map I90o by Moreno on which is shown the western boundary of Argentina Upon this map the topography is shown by shading in such a way as to bring out clearly the rugged mountain chain to the west and the broad level plains of the east It shows with marked clearness also the contrast between the regular eastern coast and the deeplyfjorded west coast A new series of maps published in London on Argentine evi dence in the ArgentineChilian boundary dispute has just appeared They portray in a very clear manner some of the larger features of the physiography of Argentina NIAGARA FALLSNotwithstanding the already extensive litera ture devoted to Niagara Falls the recent paper by Grabau Bull N Y State Museum No 45 Vol 9 1901or is a distinct addition which will be greatly welcomed by large numbers of people It is prepared with the special purpose of affording to visitors to Buffalo during the season of the PanAmerican Exposition in I9qo a viaticum in their tours through this region renowned for its scenic features and classic in its geology Owing to the object with which it is prepared this paper is natur ally a summary of our knowledge of the Niagara Falls region gained as the result of the labours of large numbers of investigators It is however more than this for from a number of points Grabau introduces new ideas concerning the interpretation of the physio graphy of the region as for example in his interpretation of the early drainage His long acquaintance with the region has fitted him admirably for the task which he has undertaken It happens that most workers in this region have looked at the Niagara pro blem from its physiographic standpoint with the result that there is scarcely anything that is full and complete on the details of the stratigraphic aspect It is in this direction that Grabaus paper is especially strong and his description with figures of the fossils of the Niagara gorge will be found of great use to those who go to study in this region One of the unique and extremely valuable portions of the report is Chapter V by Miss Letson upon the post pliocene fossils of the Niagara River gravels There is also a fairly complete bibliography of the Niagara geological literature 423Physiographic Notes THE ADIRONDACKSIn a recent number of Appalachia Vol IX 1899 Smyth has stated the main facts in the history of the Adirondack region In the complex of rocks of this mountain group some are evidently altered sediments others granites syen ites gabbros etc of plutonic origin greatly altered by metamor phism since their intrusion Thus a gneissic banding has been introduced even in the igneous members of the series Following the intrusion of the great bosses of plutonic rocks were apparently two periods of minor igneous activityone preCambrian the other postOrdovician After the preCambrian intrusion of dikes constructive action in the Adirondacks ceased for a long time A period of pro found erosion followed laying bare the rocks which had been formed or metamor phosed or both as the case might be at great depths in the earths crust Concerning the condition of the Adirondacks in Cambrian time Smyth puts forward two hypotheses from which he does not feel that the facts yet warrant a selection of either one as demon strated On the one hand it is possible that during upperCambrian time the Adirondack region formed a rugged island rather smaller than the present area of crystalline rocks and with a very irregular coast line On the other hand it is also possible that the region was reduced to low relief by preCambrian denudation and that the Potsdam outliers have been faulted into their present position 424

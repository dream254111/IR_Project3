existence of implicit functions of real variables defined as the solution of one or more equations demand that the initial point or known solution shall be an interior point of the region of definition of the functions in the given equa tions In other words the existence continuity etc of the functions occurring in the equations to be solved must be given in a complete neigh borhood of the initial point Moreover it is easy to see that these theorems do not hold at a boundary point For example the function y  x2 defined in the region y  0 vanishes at the origin but at no other point of the region although it satis fies all the conditions which would be sufficient at an interior point to insure the existence of a continuous solution of the equation y  x2  0 in the neighborhood In fact it would be obvious without an example that the boundary might be so drawn as to cut off the solution It is scarcely obvious however that the ordinary conditions may be fulfilled at a boundary point and yet the solution may not be single valued in the neighborhood This is illustrated by the following example Let Fx y be defined in the region x  iyl being equal to y when x  0 equal to y2x2 when x  0 and y  x2 and equal to y  2x2 when x  0 and y x2 This function is easily seen to be continuous together with its first order derivatives within and on the boundary of the region of definition and aFay  0 at the origin Yet the solution of Fx y  0 is obviously twovalued when x  0 since it consists of y  2x2 and y   2x2 These examples show that in the ordinary theorems the restriction of the initial solution to an interior point is an essential one The purpose of this article is to derive theorems for the case where the known solution occurs at a boundary point of the region of definition of the given functions still retaining the condition that the Jacobian of these functions shall be dif ferent from zero at the initial point The method of treatment agrees with that of Kowalewskit in that it proceeds without induction and reverses  Cf G A Bliss Princeton Colloquium Lectures  1 t Leipziger Berichte vol 60 1908 pp 1019 This paper has evidently been overlooked by Bliss For his methods for establishing existence and uniqueness are practically the same as those given by Kowalewski in this article although the latter is not referred to either in the Col

POINT 171 the more usual order by treating first the inversion of a transformation and deriving from this the solution of a system of equations 2 Preliminary Definitions The notation of Bolza by which a func tion is said to be of class C if it is onevalued and continuous and has its derivative or all its partial derivatives of the first order continuous will be extended to transformations and systems of equations if all the functions appearing explicitly in them are of class C A transformation or system of equations of class C will be called regular at any point or in any region where its Jacobian is different from zero By a region unless the contrary is stated will always be meant a com plete region i e a continuum together with all its boundary points More over at any boundary point of a region at which a given partial derivative can not be formed that derivative of any function will be called continuous if its value in the interior of the region approaches a unique boundary value and this will be called the value of the derivative at the boundary point A region will be called uniformly connected if there exists a constant G such that any two points of the region can be connected by a broken line lying wholly in the region and having a length not greater than G times the distance in a straight line between the points An example of a region which is not uniformly connected is furnished by the portion of a plane external to a cusp A function of n variables fxi  Xn will be called uniformly differ entiable in a region if there exist n variables a  n  such that n fai  hi  an  hn  fal  an  E hifx4al  an  al and such that the as approach zero with the hs uniformly for all values of a  an in the region By the vicinityt of a boundary point of a region will be meant that part of a complete neighborhood of the point which belongs to the region or if no region is mentioned then merely some part or perhaps all of a complete neighborhood 3 Lemma on Uniformly Differentiable Functions A function of class C in a uniformly connected region including its boundary is uniformly differ entiable in this region The proof will be given for two variables but is exactly the same for any number Let fx y be the function and a b be any point of the region either  Calculus of Variations pp 6 7 t Cf Pierpont Theory of functions of real variables vol 1 p 155172 L S

region is given by the function Fx y defined in  1 Incidentally we have derived by this lemma a sufficient condition that a function of two or more variables be totally differentiable at a boundary point of a region in which it is known to be of class C This property however can be established under a much less stringent condition which we may state by saying that the boundary point must be  uniformly acces sible i e the broken line joining it to any point in the vicinity must be less than G times its distance from the point where G is a constant 4 The Inverse of a Transformation THEOREM 1 If a transformation T Yi  fiXi Xn i  1   7 is regular in a uniformly connected region S of which a  a  an is a boundary point carried by T into a point b  b1  be then there exists a vicinity of a Va in which T possesses an inverse X  jiYi  yn  1  7 which is regular To prove this we must show first that if Va is suitably restricted T1 is onevalued i e no two points of Va are carried by T into the same point If two points x  x1  Xn and x  xi   Xn are trans formed by T into the same point the increment Afi of each fi in passing from one point to the other must be zero Now by the Lemma n 1 Af  E xi  xifijx  ari i  1 n j1 where fiOfilxj and each ai approaches zero as x approaches x the approach being uniform for all points x Hence by taking Va sufficiently small the maximum value of xj  xi will be restricted so that each aCij is arbitrarily small This together with the continuity of the functions fi and the continuity of a determinant as a function of its elements shows that in a sufficiently small vicinity of a the determinant of the coefficients of x  xi in 1 will remain different from zero Hence setting Af1  Af2    Aftn  0 makes xi  x j  1  n and two points having the same image must be identical The proofs that the functions io are continuous and have continuous  Cf Bliss op cit p 9 where it is stated that essentially this same determinant will remain different from zero in any region in which the Jacobian remains different from zero the fact being apparently overlooked that the arguments are in general different in the elements of different rows This is obviously an oversight as it would imply directly that a transformation with a nonvanishing Jacobian would have a onevalued inverse for any convex region as a whole174 L S DEDERICK partial derivatives are identical with those given by Kowalewski for an interior point so that it is not worth while to reproduce them here When these are supplied and the Jacobian of T1 shown in the ordinary way to be different from zero the proof is complete This theorem states properties which are practically the same at a boundary point as at an interior point Under these circumstances the theorem must necessarily lack one feature of the theorems for an interior point namely a proof of existence for this is essentially different at a boundary point This topic is discussed in the two following theorems THEOREM 2 If the transformation T is subject to the conditions of Theorem 1 the image of the boundary of S in the neighborhood of a divides the neighborhood of b into two parts of which it forms the common boundary such that at every point of one part the inverse T exists but at no point of the other Let s denote the boundary of S and s its image and let 1 and b be any two points in the neighborhood of b but not on s Then if T1 exists at b and not at b we must show that any curve joining b and b and remaining in the neighborhood of b must meet s Since b is not on s it is the image of an interior point of S and is therefore surrounded by a complete neighborhood in which T1 exists Since T1 does not exist at b there must be a boundary point d on the curve such that T1 exists at all points of the curve between b and d but fails to exist at some point of the curve in any arbitrarily small neighborhood of d As a point moves along the curve from b to d it will have an image in S which from the continuity of T1 will move along some curve from a to some limiting point c which from the continuity of T must have the image d The point c tan not be an interior point of S because in that case T1 would exist in a complete neighborhood of d It is therefore a point of s and hence d is on s This completes the proof It is easily shown in like manner that the image of S in the neighborhood of a forms a connected region THEOREM 3 If a is a nonsingular point of s the boundary locus of S Theorems 1 and 2 are applicable and b the image of a is a nonsingular point of s the image of s provided T is restricted to a sufficiently small neighborhood of a To prove the first statement we merely need to observe that in the neighborhood of a the region S must obviously be uniformly connected To prove the second statement we may assume without loss of generality that the boundary s in the neighborhood of a has the form xi  COx2    x  Loc cit  3 4 These proofs however are very simple and may easily be supplied by the readerIMPLICIT FUNCTIONS AT A BOUNDARY POINT 175 where co is of class C Then its image s will be Yi  fiWX2 X Xn X2 X z    n  4iX2y  Xn being written in parametric form It is readily seen that the functions  are of class C and that consequently a necessary condition for a singularity of s for sufficiently restricted values of the parameters is that the matrix of the partial derivatives of the functions 4i6 shall be of rank lower than n  1 But since da cIfs ax c afi 0 X n axi axl lxj clxj j 2  n this would make J  0 because this matrix can be obtained by an elementary transformation from that formed by striking out the first column of J Therefore b is a nonsingular point of s the new boundary These theorems are more than sufficient to justify certain statements on this subject which were made without proof in a recent article by the author on transformations with vanishing Jacobian It is easy to derive various other details of the properties of a regular transformation in a uniformly connected vicinity of a boundary point A number of them may be roughly summed up in the statement that at such a point as at an interior point a regular transformation is approximately projective 5 The Solution of a System of Equations The problem of solving a system of equations is easily expressible in terms of finding the inverse of a transformation whether it be at an interior point or at a boundary point Let it be required to solve for the xs the equations 1 Fjx1  xn Ul  Urn  0  n This will be accomplished if we can find the inverse of the transformation U y  Fixi X n ul  Un  n U vi  us L  MY in the form Xi  IYly   n Vw  Xi1    n For we can then set y  Y2    0 and get the solution of 1 in the form Xi b oya  no U11 qu U 1 n  Am Math Soc Trans vol 14 pp 143148 the second footnote and the last176 L S DEDERICK Accordingly if we merely observe that the Jacobian of U has the same value as that of 1 we may from Theorem 1 immediately derive THEOREM 4 If the system of equations 1 is regular in a uniformly connected region S of which a c  a  an Cl  Cm is a boundary point and if a c is a particular solution of 1 then in whatever vicinity of c  cl cm a solution of 1 exists it is of the form 2 Xi  f4u Ur i  1 n where the functions fi are all of class C provided the vicinity forms part of a sufficiently small neighborhood It now remains to determine for what values of ul  un the functions fi are defined The following theorem answers this question in general for the case that a c is a nonsingular point of the boundary THEOREM 5 If the system of equations 1 satisfies the conditions of Theorem 4 where the boundary of S is defined by the equation 3 Wx1  x n u1  um  0 in the neighborhood of a c Q being of class C and if at this point the matrix IaF1 aF 1 aF1 aF1i ax awn a3Ul aim x1   u    am IaFn aFn Wn aFn IX    U l 1 43X a 0 U1 am is of rank n  1 then the solution 2 exists in a vicinity of c  cl  cm of which the boundary may be written Oul    ur  0 where 0 is a function of class C which at c is equal to zero but has some nonvanishing partial derivative Since J the Jacobian of the functions Fj with regard to the xs is not zero the matrix will contain a nonvanishing n  1rowed determinant of which J is a minor Let us call this K and assume as a matter of notation that the additional column in K is that containing 0Fj0u1  Some element of the last row in K must be different from zero and we shall assume also as matter of notation that this is aUaxi The case that the only nonvanishing element in the last row is O0Oul is not essentially different but it will be considered separately With these assumptions we may solve equation 3 for xi getting the  B6cher Introduction to Higher Algebra  19 Theorem 1IMPLICIT FUNCTIONS AT A BOUNDARY POINT 177 boundary of S in the form xl  wX2  Xn U1   ur in a suitably restricted neighborhood as always If we apply to this the transformation U we get the boundary of S the image of S written in parametric form y  Fj0x2  x U1  ur X2  n xn U  Urn 4  4x2  Xn U U U i 1 n V  ui m Here it is to be noted that the functions it which are obviously of class C are defined in a complete neighborhood of a2  an Cl Cr n Moreover their Jacobian at this point with respect to x2 Xn and u1 is not zero For if U1 be called xX1 we have Oit Fi oF  j F  ax  OFi i  1 n Oxi ax1 ax Oxj Oxl1Q  xi Jj 2  n 1 and this is precisely the form taken by the typical element in the minor of OQOx1 in the determinant K after all the remaining elements of the last row have been made zero by the usual process Since this determinant is not zero the ordinary theorem on implicit functions tells us that there is a solution of the first n equations of 4 in the form 5 lU  xiYl  Yn U2  Un  Xi  xiY1 y n U2  Um X  2  n where the xs are of class C If in 5 the first of these equations we replace the us by vs we have the equation VI  x1Y1  yn V2  V  which represents the boundary of S that is to say U1 is defined in the vicinity of 0  0 cl cm in which v1  xi and not in that wherev1  xi This will be true in particular in the domain V formed by setting Y1  Y2    0 the boundary then being VI  x1A O0 v2 V m  XVl  Vm Now A is carried by the transformation U1 into a region z of which the boundary is u  XU2  Un This if written in the form Oul  ur  0 will satisfy the conditions of the theorem178 L S DEDERICK The treatment is very little changed in the excepted case where au2ui is the only nonvanishing element in the last row of K Here we solve equation 3 for ul and the equations corresponding to 4 for xi  Xn and substitute the values of the latter in the expression for ul This leads to an equation having exactly the same properties as 5 The reasoning and remaining details are exactly the same as before and the proof is hereby completed If the matrix mentioned in this theorem is of rank n we may expect the boundary of 2 to have a singularity at the point in question The character of this singularity may be determinedat least formallyby substituting in Q the values of the xs and us from U1 provided the necessary higher partial derivatives of Q and the Fs exist and are continuous 6 Conclusion The principal results of this article may be summed up in the following statement If the given functions are of class C the ordinary theorems on implicit functions can be extended to the case where the initial solution is a boundary point with only such changes as are obvious provided the region in the neighborhood of this boundary point is uniformly connected

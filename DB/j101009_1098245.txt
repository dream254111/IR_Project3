Supreme Court of that StateMorris v State Mutual Life As surance Co 39 Atl 52 Jan 31898 the only difference being that in the lat ter case the policy was payable not to the assured but to his wife The appli cation contained a clause against sui cide but as in the Ritter Case it was excluded under the Pennsylvania stat ute so that the policy as construed contained no stipulation as to suicide The trial court excluded evidence offered by the defense that the assured took his life while sane On appeal the com pany relied upon the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals in the Ritter Case but the court held the ruling of the trial court proper and distinguished the case from the other by reason of the fact that the policy was payable to the wife and not to the personal representa tive of the assured The same question as to the effect of suicide by the assured when sane was recently presented in another Pennsyl vania case decided by the Supreme Court of that StateMorris v State Mutual

McClellan 43 S W 641 Court of Civil Appeals of Texas Nov 13 1897 it was held that the innkeepers lien did not extend to drummers sam ples when it appeared that the innkeeper knew all along that the goods were the property not of the drummer but of his employer Before the decision in the present case this question had arisen only twice In Covington v Newberger 99 N C 523 1888 the same conclusion as in the prin cipal case was reached See also Broadwood v Granaray 10 Exch 417 1854 The next question arose in Robins  Co v Gray 1865 2 Q B 501 and the result is in open conflict with Covington v Newberger supra In that case Lord 1898 121VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Esher held that the question of the innkeepers knowledge as to the ownership of the samples is immaterial It is obviously impossible to harmonize these two lines of cases It is respectfully submitted however that as the inkeeper is bound to receive the goods of a guest without inquiries as to his title Gordon v Silber 25 Q B D 491 1890 the innkeeper should not be deprived of his lien even if he knows the goods to belong to a third party American Law Register Samples of a traveling salesman belonging to his employer are held in Brown Shoe Co v Hunt Iowa 39 L R A 291 to be subject to a lien for the hotel bill of the salesman under a statute authorizing such lien on all property under the control of the guest and this statute is held constitutional SUBSTANTIVE LAW UNDER THE GUISE OF EVIDENCE The ordinary party to an action if he feels that justice has been done especially if it inclines to his side generally accepts the final decision as being the sole matter of interest to him It is not so with the judicial mind to which the correctness of the result is of no greater interest than the principles on which that result rests A de cision recently handed down by the United States Supreme Court in the case of the Richmond  Alleghany R R Co v R A Patterson Tobacco Co 18 Sup Ct Rep 335 is interesting from both these points of view A statute of Virginia declares that a carrier who accepts goods for transportation to a point beyond his own route is responsible for them as a common carrier unless he shall have contracted in writing that beyond the terminus of his own line he is to be responsible only as a forwarding agent The court holds that such a statute merely lays down a rule of evidence and does not so infringe the right of the carrier to limit his liability by contract as to amount to a regulation of interstate commerce The substantial justice of this class of decisions has been recently touched upon See 11 Harvard Law Review 544 Turning however to the other aspect of the question can it be said as a matter of principle that the true ratio decidendi is that which is intimated by the court It is true that it is commonly said of the clauses in the Statute of Frauds and similar statutes that the requirements laid down by them are those of the law of evidence It may perhaps be ques tioned whether this is not  obscuring the difference between substance and form and whether it would not possibly be more correct on principle to say that these are simply cases of substantive law couched sometimes for the sake of conveni ence in terms of evidence To draw an illustration from another field of law it could hardly be maintained that the requirement of a seal for a covenant or of witnesses for a will belongs to the law of evidence The requirement is simply a rule of substantive law that a document without a seal is not a covenant or with out witnesses is not a will It is readily conceivable that there might be an abun dance of probative matter by which the agreement of the parties in the one case or the desires of the deceased in the other could be established beyond cavil The proof might be wholly unobjectionable on any of the laws of evidence and yet all this endeavor would be in vain7 not because of any law of evidence but because the law in regard to instruments makes it necessary that a deed should have a seal and a will witnesses and these documents do not fulfil the requirements Similarly in the present case the real difficulty that the appellant encountered was not that he could not establish that had been agreed upon but that because 122 June1898 AMONG OUR EXCHANGES 123 of the substantive law of Virginia in regard to carriers the agreement would not do him any good when he had established it his trouble is that he is trying to do something which is legally inadmissible not that he is trying to do a permis sible thing by means of evidence which is objectionableHarvard Law Review A BUREAU OF JUSTICE The Bureau of Justice in this city has done a great work and is in every way worthy of the confidence of the bar and the people of this city It has during the last ten years protected hundreds of worthy people struggling to preserve the little household goods they have left from socalled legal sharks and pre vented their being sent to the poorhouse The following call signed by directors of the bureau to the public has been sent out and we know it will meet a hearty response from the public DEAR SIR As members of the bar and directors of the Bureau of Justice we would like to bring to your attention the work of an organization which we be lieve should appeal peculiaHly to lawyers The Bureau of Justice was organized some ten years ago for the purpose of giv ing legal advice to poor people and its record shows that the work accomplished should commend it as an institution worthy the liberal support of the citizens and most especially worthy the recognition and support of the bar Of the 38832 cases presented covering every phase of the civil and criminal law only 2472 were taken into court proving what the directors claim that the bureau is a court of conciliation Of the 2472 cases taken into court 124 were withdrawn and 124 were lost In other words nine out of every ten cases were won The bureau neither prosecutes nor defends personal injury suits nor suits for divorce and it thoroughly investigates before it sues It is a consummation devoutly to be wished that the bureau may be main tained by the legal profession as the free dispensaries are maintained by the medi cal profession The bar as an organization could well and easily afford to do this and save much valuable time to busy attorneys who would then send the worthy cases in which they were interested to the bureau for attention As it is not ten per cent of the subscriptions are made by lawyers In 1897 thirtyone attorneys contributed 257 The bar should make a better showing than this Subscrip tions from lawyers of ten dollars and upwards are most earnestly requested The bureau needs your moral as well as your financial aid Will you not make this your favored philanthropy and send your check to C E Kremer treasurer to help in the maintenance of this The Legal Philanthropy Chicago Legal News SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACT FOR INTEREST IN RAILWAY FRANCHISE DENIED In Hyer v Richmond Traction Co 18 Sup Ct Rep 114 it appeared that two persons who had made separate applications to the City Council for the grant of a street railway franchise had entered into a contract between themselves to unite their interests to mutually cooperate in acquiring the franchise and to divide between them the profits realized from the enterprise that thereafter the City Council with full knowledge of this contract granted the franchise to one of the parties exclusively which party then formed a corporation issuing all the stockVIRGINIA LAW REGISTER to himself and his associates and entirely excluding the other party The latter party brought an action for the specific performance of the contract praying for a decree declaring him to be the owner of an interest in the franchise and property and requiring a transfer to him of his proper proportion of the shares of stock in the corporation thus formed by his associate It was held that this was not a case in which specific performance of a contract would be decreedand this although the contract might be considered as one for the transfer of stock and although the stock was not without a recognized market value since the present value of the franchise and consequently the damage caused by the repudiation of the con tract could be estimated by a jury from a consideration of the miles of track in volved the population adjacent to the line and the cost of construction and operation In the opinion of the court the remedy of the plaintiff was an action at law Doubt will arise among the profession as to the soundness of this deci sion So many elements of a more or less speculative character enter into the question of the value of a street railway franchise that it cannot be said that the plaintiff in this case had an adequate remedy at law It is the constant practice of the best courts to sustain the granting of injunctions where the plaintiff has even a plainer remedy at law than this and the right to a specific performance ought to stand on the same ground Moreover the courts ought to take into con sideration the view more than they do that where a party has under the terms of a contract a right to a distinct thing the law ought to give him that thing when it can do so as well as not and not remit him to the opinion which a jury may have as to the damages which he has suffered through its being denied him In this particular case a jury might award the plaintiff not more than half or onethird of his real damages and he would be remediless Equitable remedies of the character of the one in question ought to be expanded rather than cur tailedAmerican Law Review 124 June

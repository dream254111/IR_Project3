communicated by a Learned and Inqui sitive Physitian in Holland considerably enlarging the Obser vation made of the same Case by the famous Dr Tulpius lib 4 Obs c 48 SOme years since there came to Dr D a young Woman of a bout 17 years of age unmarried and reputed a Maid of a florid countenance and strong body having a good stomach periodice menstruata and wanting none of other due evacuati S 2 ons132 ons not troubled with headach nor sleepiness nor difficulty of breathing nor drought nor any of the symptoms incident to Hydropical persons This young woman having her belly swollen to excess in three months time was much suspected by the Physitian whom she addressed herself to as if she had been deflowered which yet with many imprecations she denied though in vain the Physitian disbelieving her asseverations and particularly that she had her periodical lochia because she look ed so well nor had any signs of an hydropical Distemper upon her except the tumor of her belly which being felt afforded some considerable signs to dispossess the Physitian of the o pinion he had of this person seeing it was not a prominent nor roundish tumor nor any such as is usual in women with child besides that she made not such a coloured and crasse Urine as Childbearing women are wont to do Yet there appearing no symptoms of a Dropsy no complaints of the stomack liver spleen kidneys no swelling of the loins or inferior limbs no leanness in the body or superior parts no flaccid nor disco lourd breasts but all being thus far in a good constitution the Physitian sent her away without giving or prescribing her any Physick putting her in mind of that saying That the whole need no Physitian but the sick Yet she returnd soon after importu ning him to give her his advice against the Dropsy He con sulting with other Physitians about it found them as well di stracted between both as he was himself Yet some of them in clining rather to the opinion of a Dropsy with appropriate Medicines made her void abundance of water yet without un swelling her belly Whereupon she addressed herself to Mounte banks who voided her purse without voiding her belly of the water This made her give over for a while the use of all Re medies committing the whole business to Nature and so conti nuing for six months But then hearing of another Hydropical woman that had been cured by her first Physitian she returnd to him with tears in her eyes beseeching his assistance He now finding her body dryed and bloodless her breath short her temples fallen in her nose sharp her eyes hollow her skin wan and illfavourd her pulse creeping her appetite prostrate her tongue dry her voice weak her evacuations sparing and all her133 her strength dejected in a word liker a Sceleton than a living Body he calls together divers of his Colleagues to view this miserable Creature who being now sufficiently convinced of the nature of this Distemper did though the case was how de sperate resolve upon the use of a paracentesis or incision which the Patient abhorring she was left to herself and dyed three months after Her body being opend there soon appeard a great lake of water whence at first it seemd to be a common Ascites a tumour of waters stagnating in the abdomen Then the Liver being lookd after it was no where seen Next the other viscera being sought for viz the Mesentery Pancreas Spleen and Kidneys none of them all appeard neither to the astonish ment of all that were present who searching further and meet ing with the Peritonaeum found it to be turned into a bagg by a seperation made of its interior membrane from its exterior and so enclosing within it the whole bulk of that rest gnant water that not a drop of it had been able to get out into the abdomen This costed no small trouble to render it conspi cuous by emptying this sack of all the Serum and so discove ring both sides of the bagg made up of the double peritonae um whose inner skin had been severd from the outer sticking to the traniverse Muscles of the Epigastium the hydropical waters having forced the inner membrane inwards into the hol low of the abdomen and so forming it into the shape of a bagg whose compass reached from the pubes unto the diaphragme and from the left region of the loyns to the right so that the nervous body of the eritonaeum being here very thick and close withal was by little and little expanded as the capacity of the womb in gravidation is still more and more enlarged Where it seems worth inquiring Whence this peritonaeum had acquired this extraordinary thickness being thicker and closer than any Oxehide where as naturallytis as thin as any silken webb But to proceed This bagg of the peritonaeum being removd the vicera came to view which were not gravelly nor tartareous nor chalky as they often are in Hydropical bodies but only decayed and colourless Which decay by the timely use of an Incision might have been prevented An

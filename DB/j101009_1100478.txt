Wytheville June 11 1903 1 MARINE INSURANCEStress of weatherProximate causeCollision In an action on a marine policy insuring a ship and its machinery against loss or damage occasioned by the breaking of machinery caused by stress of weather or collision a declaration which charged that the ship collided with some sunken or floating obstruction in the river while proceeding on her journey that there was a freshet and strong current in the river and that the injuries to the machinery particularly set forth and enumerated in the declaration were caused by such collision with such obstruction in the then prevailing freshet and strong current does not state a good cause of action The proximate cause of the injury to the machinery was not the Stress of weather and striking a  sunken or floating obstruction  was not a  col lision  in the sense in which that term is used in Marine Insurance 2 INSURANCE Conditions and restrictive provisions Code sec 3252 con strued Section 3252 of the Code provides in what size type  conditions or restrictive provisions  of insurance policies shall be printed but has no application to the general indemnity clause of the policy nor to specifica tions merely of the loss or damage for which the insured had assumed re sponsibility Stipulations with respect to the risks instired against which impose no onus on the insured and with respect to which he could not be guilty of any act of omission or commission which could affect his right of recovery are not within the statute Error to a judgment of the Court of Law and Chancery of the city of Norfolk rendered JanuLary 24 1902 in an action of assump sit wherein the plaintiff in error was the plaintiff and the defend ant in error was the defendant Affirmed The opinion states the case Edward R Baird Jr for the plaintiff in error Ilughes  Little and Daniel Hf Hayne for the defendant in error  Reported by M P Burks State Reporter318 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Aug WHITTLE J delivered the opinion of the court This was an action of assumpsit on a policy of marine insurance covering the plaintiffs interest in the steam tug Annie The policy was issued from the Baltimore office of the defendant com pany and was mailed by its agents there to the plaintiff who then resided in the city of Richmond The contract of insurance consists of a policy in usual form with a rider attached and contains the stipulation that the provi sions of the rider are to be regarded as a substitute for those of the poliev in case of conflict After a general indemnity clause embracing the hull tackle apparel and furniture engines boilers machinery and stores of the good tug called Annie there is excepted from the risks assumed loss or damage caused by the bursting or collapsing of boiler or boilers or the breaking of machinery unless caused by stress of weather stranding burning or collision The trial court sustained a demurrer to the last amended declara tion and rendered judgment for the defendant To that judgment a writ of error was allowed by one of the judges of this court The declaration avers that the said tug Annie   while proceeding down the James river from the port at Richmond sus tained injuries whereby her connecting rod lightpressure cylinder highpressure cylinder headstrap and key and crosshead were broken and her piston rod bent and    that the injuries aforesaid were caused by collision and stress of weather that when said tug    was off Chaffins Bluff the said tug collided with some sunken or floating obstruction that there was a freshet and strong current in the river that the injuries aforesaid were caused by such collision with such obstruction in the then prevailing freshet and strong current It will be observed that the gravamen of the complaint is damage to the machinery and it appears from the statement in the declara tion as to the manner in which the accident happened that the proximate cause of it was impact with the sunken or floating ob struction and not stress of weather If there had been no obstruc tion in her course it is quite apparent that the tug would have been unaffected by the prevailing freshet and strong current in the river The law cannot consider the causes of causes and an insurer is only liable for losses proximately occasioned by the perils insured1903 CLINE V WESTERN ASSURANCE CO 319 against the maxim being Causa proxima non remota spectatur Brooms Leg Max 217 Insurance Co v Reynolds 32 Gratt 613 Insurance Co v Adams 123 U S 67 8 Sup Ct 68 31 L Ed 63 Magoun v Insurance Co 1 Story 164 Fed Cas No 8961 Peters v Insurance Co 14 Pet 109 10 L Ed 371 In the view taken by this court of the case it involves the con sideration of two propositions 1 Was the disaster which is the ground of action caused by a collision within the meaning of the policy  And if it was not 2 Does the type statute Code Va 1887 sec 3252 apply to and render invalid the machinery clause of the rider for the reason that it is printed in type of smaller sizethan long primer type It is not pretended that the injury described in the declaration was caused either by stranding or burning and as remarked the contention that it was proximately caused by stress of weather is not maintainable Unless therefore striking the sunken or floating obstruction constituted a collision in the sense of the policy there can be no recovery under the first proposition It must be borne in mind that the court is dealing with a con tract of marine insurance and it is in that relation that the mean ing of the term collision is to be ascertained Bouvier defines it to be the act of ships or vessels striking together or of one vessel running against or foul of another Bouviers Law Dict Rawtes Revision 349 The case of Richardson v Burrows decided in Queens Bench December 16 1880 is precisely in point The action was on a marine policy which contained the following clause Warranted free from particular average partial loss unless the ship or craft be stranded sunk in collision or on fire and the question was whether striking a sunken wreck was a colli sion within the meaning of the policy Lord Coleridge who re sided at the trial held that it was not and says in that connection It collision means collision with another ship and does not mean either rock or sand bank or floating wreck or anything but thne ordinary meaning in my judgment of collision The case was not appealed In the case of Hough v Head 54 L J Q B 294 the charterers were operating a vessel under a charter party which provided That in the event of loss of time by deficiency of men collision320 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Aug breakdown of engines and the vessel becomes incapable of steam ing or proceeding for more than fortyeight working hours pay ment of hire to cease until such time as she is gotten in an efficient state to resume her voyage The charterers had taken out a policy against loss of freight on the vessel being operated under the charter The vessel while passing through the Straits of Magellan struck some soft substance with her bottom amidships but did not lose headway At the end of the voyage it was discovered that her keel was broken and that she had become incapable of steaming for some time Suit was brought against the underwriters for loss of freight while the vessel was undergoing repairs Among other defenses it was insisted that there was no collision Grove J said I am also in favor of the defeudant on the other two grounds though it is really unnecessary to say much about them I think that what happened did not amount to a col lision The vessel probably ran on to a bank and this was not as it seems to rne a collision within the ordinary acceptation of that term such as would be the case if a vessel struck another vessel or other navigable matter such as a raft On these grounds the defendants are in my opinion entitled to judgment It will be noticed that in order to bring the collision clause into operation there must be a collision between the ship insured and some other ship or vessel and that the only damages insured against are in the ordinary forms of the clause sums payable to the owners of the latter vessel in consequence thereof The ship owner is therefore not protected against liability due to his vessel running into a dockwall breakwater pontoon or anything that is not another ship Nor even where there has been a collision be tween his ship and another ship is he indemnified in respect to any damages which he may in consequence thereof be compelled to pay to any third person 2 Arnold on Marine Ins secs 795 796 See also 2 Marshall on Marine Ins bk 1 sec 2 p 494 Emerigon on Ins Meredith Ed p 327 2 Browne on Civil and Admiralty Law p 111 Everard v Kendall L R 5 C P 428 Robson v The Kate 21 Q B D 13 The authorities relied on by counsel for plaintiff in error cannot be fairly said to be in conflict with the foregoing citations Spencer on Marine Collisions sec 10 says The term col lision in the strict nautical and legal acceptation of the term1903 CLINE V WESTERN ASSURANCE CO 321 means the impinlging of vessels together Common usage however has extended the application of the term so as to include the impact of a vessel with other floating objects The author proceeds to divide collisions into two classesthose occurring between vessels and other floating objects and those occurring with fixed and stationary objects He quotes the decision of The Maxey F C 9894 to sustain the doctrine that common usage has extended the application of tlhe term so as to include the impact of a vessel with other floating objects The real language of that opinion is This clearly is not a case of collision within the nautical acceptation of that term which imports the impinging of vessels together whilst in the act of being navigated Common usage however applies the term equally to cases where a vessel is run foul of when entirely stationary or is brought in contact with another by swinging at her anchor The author also states that Lord Coleridge held in Richardson v Buirrows supra that the striking of a ship on a field of ice is not a collision As has been seen his lordships ruling in that case was in respect to a ship striking a sunken wreck and not a field of ice as supposed In the concluding paragraph of the section the author says Our courts have repeatedly held that actions may be maintained in admiralty for damages arising from contact of a vessel with rafts and a variety of floating objects and no reason is apparent whv these mishaps may not be designated as collisions Courts of admiralty have jurisdiction over all torts occurring on navigable waters and the cases with which the decisions adverted to dealt were marine torts and not collision 3 Joyce oD Ins sec 2252 is relied on to sustain the contention that where a vessel is insured against a collision a recovery may be had for an injury occasioned from running against a snag The English case referred to as supporting the text is that of Reischur v Borwickl 2 Q B 548 decided in the year 1894 The language of the policy sued on was Only against risk of collision as per clause attached and damage received in collision with any object including ice The court held that the first part of the sentence alluded to col lisions between ships but allowed a recovery because the injury fronm the snag was embraced by the language collision with any object322 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Aug Lindley L J says The risk of collision as per clause attached refers to collisions with other ships and may be disre garded The other risk refers to and includes such a collision as took place in the present case viz a collision between the ship in sured and a snag in the river which she was navigating Lopes L J says This is a policy indemnifying the insured against the risk of collision by which I understand collision with other ships and damage received in collision with any object in eluding ice  In section 2753 of Joyce on Insurance the quotation is from the case of Insurance Co v Borwivck 2 Q B 279 decided in the year 1895 The language of the policy there was Against risk or loss or damage through collision with any other ship or vessel or ice or sunken or floating wreck or any other floating substance or har bors or wharves or piers or stages or similar structures The judge says It is contended that the losses in the present case do not come within a clause insuring against loss by collision but the clause in question here is much more extensive in its ex emption Borrows v Bell 4 B  C 10 E C L 736 was a case in which a vessel coming into a crowded harbor during a storm struck upon an anchor and springing a leak was beached by the crew The question involved was whether that was a case of stranding It does not appear that the policy contained anything on the subject of collision The remaining authority relied on is the case of London Assur Co v Campanhia 167 U S 149 17 Sup Ct 785 42 L Ed 113 in which it was held that vessels may be in collision within the meaning of an insurance policy although but one of them is in motion while the other is at a wharf fully loaded and ready to proceed upon her voyage It seems clear that it cannot be predicated of the foregoing authorities that they sustain the contention that the injuries com plained of are covered by the collision clause of the policy in ques tion To the contrary the decisions are practically unanimous the other way The second proposition involves the constructioll of section 3252 of the Code of Virginia of 1887 which reads as follows In any action against an insurance company or other insurer  no failure to performi any condition of the policy or viola1903 CLINE V WESTERN ASSURANCE CO 323 tion of any restrictive provision thereof shall be a valid defense to such action unless it appears that such condition or restrictive pro vision is printed in type as large as or larger than that commonly known as long primer type or is written with pen and ink in or on the policy It is insisted that the paragraph in the rider to the policy War ranted free from claim for loss or damage caused by the bursting or collapsing of the boiler or boilers or the breaking of machinery unless caused by stress of weather stranding burning or collision is invalid because it is printed in smaller type than that prescribed by statute It may be remarked that the paragraph in question and the general indemnity clause are printed in the same type So there is nothing in the circumstance that the machinery clause is in smaller type than long primer type to indicate a purpose on the part of the insurer to mislead the insured with respect to the provisions of that clause The statute in terms specifies conditions and restrictive pro visions which impose upon the insured the performance of some function the nonperformance of which would defeat a recovery in an action on the policy provided such condition or restrictive provision is printed in type of the size required or is written with pen and ink It can have no application therefore to the ma chinery clause since that clause imposes the performance of no duty upon the insured and in no event could his right of recovery be affected by any act done or omitted to be done by him in regard to it It is apparent that the policy of the statute is to require such conditions or restrictive provisions as impose an obligation upon the insured to do or to abstain from doing some act to be so plainly printed as not to escape observation Otherwise as ex perience has proved his right of recovery might be defeated by the neglect to perform a requirement of the existence of which he is wholly ignorant In other words the design of the enactment is to protect the insured from being entrapped by the use of small type into omitting the performance of some act required as a con dition precedent to a recovery such as furnishing an appraisement proof of loss and the like But stipulations of the policy with respect to the risks insured against which impose no onus on the insured are not within the statute324 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Aug The machinery clause is plainly of the latter class It enjoins no duty upon the insured and with respect to it he can be guilty of no offense either of commission or of omission which could by possibility affect his right of recovery in an action on the policy It contains a specification merely of the loss or damage for which the insurer has assumed responsibility and there can be no more reason for holding that the type statute applies to that clause than to the general indemnity clause The statute does not prescribe the size of type in which that class of stipulations shall be printed The case of Life Association v Berkeley 97 Va 571 34 S E 469 is relied on as sustaining a different construction of section 3252 but the condition of the policy construed in that case was dis tinctly of the character prescribed by the statute The association issued a policy on the life of F B Berkeley for 2000 in consider ation of bimonthlv premiums of 1250 to be paid upon the death of the insured less any indebtedness due the company On the inner sheet of the policy in fine type there was a provision that the policy should be charged with any unpaid portion of a gross premium of 1110 In other words the policy entitled the bene ficiary to receive 2000 upon the death of the insured in considera tion of the payment of the bimonthly premiums whereas the pro vision referred to required the payiment in addition of such part of a gross premium of 1110 as might remain unpaid by the bimonthly prenmiums at the death of the insured The provision imposed an obligation not embraced in the body of the policy which if upheld would have defeated pro tan to a recovery on the policy The court therefore properly held that the stipulation was within the prohibition of the statute and therefore invalid So in Burruss v lNaltiotal Life Assn 96 Va 543 32 S E 49 the court after declaring the application to be a part of the con tract of insurance said In the case at bar it is conceded that the conditions and restrictive provisions found in the application the failure to perform wvhich is relied on by the defendant in part as its defense to the plaintiffs motion are in type smaller than that required by the statute The clause in the application obnoxious to this provision of the statute must therefore be disregarded and the case considered as if no conditions or restrictive provisions were embodied in the contract sued on It was also insisted on behalf of defendant in error that the policy becamne effective in Maryland and for that reason the Vir1903 RICHMOND PASSENGER ETC CO V RACKS 325 ginia type statute does not apply but the case having been dis posed of on other grounds the decision of that question is deemed unnecessary In both aspects of the case this court is of opinion that the law on the demurrer is with the defendant and that the judgment of tlhe trial court in so holding is without error and must be affirmed Affirmed

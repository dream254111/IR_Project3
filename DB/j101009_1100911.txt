Stats U S 435 a petition for removal from a State court in Virginia to the Federal court must be filed on or before the rule day on which under the practice in the State court a plea in abatement must be filednamely on or before the return day of the writ if the declaration be filed on that day IDEM Defendant a nonresident corporation filed its petition in the State court for removal to the Federal Court on the ground of diverse citizenship of the parties after the time permitted by the State practice for filing pleas in abatement but within the time permitted for filing pleas in bar Held That the petition is too late and will be disallowed Mahoney v Building A88n 70 Fed 513 and Wil8on v Railroad Co 82 Fed 15 disapproved On a petition praying that R M Hubbard be enjoined from pro ceeding with an action at law against the Fidelity  Casualty Com pany in the Corporation Court of Danville Va Green Withers  Green for F  C Co Peatross  Harris for Hubbard MIcDOWELL District Judge delivered the opinion of the court It appears that on May 9 1902 R M Hubbard a citizen of Virginia sued out from the office of the clerk of the Corporation court of Danville a summons requiring the company a citizen of New York to appear at first June rules 1902 and answer a de claration in trespass on the case the damages being laid at 4000 The summons was served in due time At first June rules the declaration was filed and the common order was entered At second June rules the common order was confirmed and writ of enquiry ordered as the company had failed to appear The first term of the court at which a defence on the merits could be made commenced on June 7 1902 On that day the company filed its petition for removal to this court on the ground of diverse citizen ship which is in due form On the ground that the petition was offered too late the Corporation court refused to accept it410 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Oct The time for filing the petition and bond under the Act of 1875 18 Stats 471 was before or at the term at which said cause could be first tried and before the trial thereof The language of the Act of 1887 24 Stats 554 and of the Act of 1888 25 Stats 435 is as follows it   may   file a petition in such suit in such State court at the time or at any time before the defendant is required by the laws of the State or the rule of the State court in which such suit is brought to answer or plead to the declaration or complaint of the plaintiff     It shall then be the duty of the State court to accept said petition and bond and proceed no further in such suit   Under the Virginia statute Code 1887 sec 3287 3288 the office judgment in common law causes does not become final until the last or fifteenth day of the next following term And prior to such day of the term the defendant can interpose a plea to the merits The filing of such plea sets aside the office judgment In chancery causes the decree nisi is taken on the return day of the writ and at the next nrle day the decree pro confesso is taken Code 1887 sec 3284 but by sec 3275 answer may be filed at any time before final decree The question to be decided turns on the proper construction of the Act of Congress of August 13 1888 25 Stats 435  Does the language of the Act refer to the time when a pleading to the merits is required to be filed or to the time when dilatory pleas are re quired to be filed If this question could be treated as an open one there are reasons aside from the very short time given a defendant to pre pare and file removal papers which lend force to the argument that the former is the true construction of the Act The Act of 1875 clearly allowed the petition for removal to be filed at the trial term If Congress in enacting the statute of 1887 and in correcting it by the statute of 1888 had intended to make a radical change in the removal practice it seems that it would have plainly indicated such an intent Yet the language in the later statutes is suscept ilble and easily susceptible of being construed to mean that the time for filing the petition and bond is the time when pleadings in bar must be filed Again the statute requires that the petition and bond are to be presented in the State court Not in the clerks office and not before the judge thereof Under the Virginia prac tice and I think this is true in many of the States the time for1902 FIDELITY  CASUALTY CO V HUBBARD 411 filing dilatory pleas is during the vacation of the court and the place is the clerks office Congress might be presumed to have known this and if it had been the intention that the petition for removal must be filed at the time that dilatory pleas are due it would seem to be fairly argued that provision would have been made for offering the petition and bond to the judge of the State court in vacation or for filing them in the clerks office It is not conclusive against this argument that the intent was that the Federal court should be the one to pass on the validity of dilatory pleas as well as of pleas in bar Under the construction requiring the petition and bond to be filed at or before the time when pleas in bar are due the defendant by filing the removal papers on the return day of the writ could secure a hearing in the Federal court on his dilatory pleas And by failing to file his petition until term time it is difficult to find in the statute any intent that he should thereby lose the right to have the Federal court try the cause on its merits However there are dilatory pleas that are technically known pleas to the declaration For instance for variance between writ and declaration 4 Minors Iusts 3d ed Pt 1 p 754 Hence it is clear that the statute is capable of being construed as meaning tlle time when the earliest pleading of any kind is due But the question is not as I think open to construction by a sub ordinate Federal court In Mariin v B  0 R Co 151 U S 673 which went up from West Virginia the facts were the same as in the case at bar The defendant did not appear or plead on the return day of the writ nor at the next rules but at the next term of courtnot having filed any pleadingsit presented its petition for removal and bond The court held that the defendant was not a citizen of West Vir ginia that its petition for removal was filed too late and that as no objection to the removal had been made in the lower courts this objection had been waivedL The language of the opinion is in part as follows  It was therefore filed at or before the time at which the defendant was re quired by the laws of the State to answer or plead to the merits of the case but after the time at which he was required to plead to the jurisdiction of the court or in abatement of the writ  Was this a compliance with the provision of the Act of Congress of 1887 which defines the time of filing a petition for removal in the State court We are of opinion that it was not for more than one reason This provision allows412 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Oct the petition for removal to be filed at or before the time when the defendant is required by the local law or rule of court to answer or plead to the declaration or complaint These words make no distinction between different kinds of answers to pleas and all pleas or answers of the defendant whether in matter of law by demurrer or in matter of fact either by dilatory plea to the jurisdic tion of the court or in suspension or abatement of the particular suit or by plea in bar of the whole right of action are said in the standard books on pleading to oppose or answer the declaration or complaint which the defendant is sum moned to meet Stephen PI lst Am ed 30 62 63 70 71 239 Lawes PI 36 The Judiciary Act of September 24 1789 chap 20 sec 12 required a petition for removal of a case from a State court into the Circuit Court of the United States to be filed by the defendant at the time of entering his appear ance in such State court 1 Stats at L 79 The recent Acts of Congress have tended more and more to contract the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States which had been enlarged by intermediate acts and to restrict it more nearly within the limits of the earliest statute Construing the provision now in question havinig regard to the natural meaning of its language and to the history of the legislation upon this subject the only reasonable inference is that Congress contemplated that the petition for removal should be filed in the State court as soon as the defendant was required to make any defense whatever in that court so that if the case should be re moved the validity of any and all of his defenses should be tried and determined in the Circuit Court of the United States In Mahoney v Butilding Assn 70 Fed 513 Judge Simonton holding the above opinion to be obiter ruled that the petition and bond may be seasonably filed at the rule day next succeeding the return day of the writ And the reasoning in the opinion covers the facts in the case at bar In Wilson v Railroad Co 82 Fed 15 the supcena was issued and served in October returnable to November rules At the November rules the bill was filed but the decree nisi was not taken At December rules the defendant filed its petition for removal Judge Jackson also holding the opinion in Martin v B  0 R Co to be obiter held that the petition was filed in due time reason ing that the time intended by the removal statute is the time wheln pleas to the merits must be filed This ruling was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals 99 Fed 642 but apparently this point was not pressed on argument before the court and does not appear to have had the full attention of the court If the Supreme Court had left the question here I should feel at liberty to regard the opinion in llartin v B  0 R Co as a dic tum because not necessary to the decision of that case and to hold that the petition for removal can be filed at the term of court when1902 FIDELITY  CASUJALTY CO V HUBBARD 413 pleas in bar are first due But the Supreme Court has rendered at least three subsequent opinions which cannot be disregarded They are Goldey v Morning News 156 U S 518 Wabash R Co v Brow 164 U S 271 and Powers v Railway Co 169 U S 92 In Goldey v Morning News the opinion reads in part It has been held by this court upon full consideration that the provision of this Act    requires the petition to be there filed at or before the time when the defendant is    required to file any kind of plea or answer whether    in suspension or abatement of the particular suit or by plea in bar of the whole right of action    because as this court said the only reasonable inference is that Congress contemplated that the petition for removal should be filed in the State court as soon as the defendant was re quired to make any defence whatever in that court so that if the case should be removed the validity of any and all of his defences should be tried and determined in the Circuit Court of the United States Martin v Baltimore  0 B Co 151 U S 673 In Wabash R Co v Brow 164 U S 271 this part of the opinion in Martin v B  0 R Co is again quoted And in Powers v Railway Co 169 U S 98 it is said Undoubtedly when the case as stated in the plaintiffs declaration is a removable one the defendant should file his petition for removal at or before the time when he is required by the law or practice of the State to make any defence whatever in its courts The reason that inferior courts are not bound by obiter dicta of the superior courts is that expressions of opinion thrown off by the way are presumably not deliberate and settled conclusions such as are intended to control in future cases But the above quoted opinion in Martin v B  0 R Co cannot now be regarded as a dictumn It was rendered upon full consideration by an un divided court and has ever since been treated by the Supreme Court as its final and conclusive construction of the removal statute of 1888 See also Fidelity Co v Newport Co 70 Fed 407 Firist Bridge Corp v Conn Co 71 Fed 225 Collins v Stott 76 Fed 613 Fink v Blaclkinton 80 Fed 306 18 Ency P1  Pr 288 In this State no plea in abatement can be filed after the defend ant has demurred pleaded in bar or answered to the declaration or bill nor after a decree nisi or conditional judgment at rules Code 87 sec 3260 Acts 978 p 198 By sec 3284 of the Code of 1887 the decree nisi or conditional judgment is taken if the de fendant has not appeared and if the bill or declaration has been414 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGITER Oct filed on the return day of the writ if then executed In the case at bar the writ was duly executed and returned to first June rules and at the time the declaration was filed The defendant did then enter an appearance Conseauently the time when a plea in abate ment was due was the first June rules At that time the petitioni for removal and bond must have been filed It follows that this cause is properly pending in the Corporation court of Danville and that the injunction must be refused In this case no bond was filed at the time the petition was offered It is of course unnecessary to consider the bearing this fact may have or the reasons alleged in excuse for the failure to comply with this provision of the removal act Nor have I considered the propriety of issuing an injunction where the removal papers have been properly filed NOTEThe ruling in this case establishes an important point of Federal practice in this State to which the especial attention of the bar of the two Vir ginias is called Since the decision by Judge Simonton in Mahoney v Building Assn 70 Fed 513 followed by that of Judge Jackson of West Virginia in Wilson v Winchester 82 Fed 15 many members of the bar in Virginia and West Virginia have doubtless supposed the point to be settled that a petition for removal to the Federal court from the State couirt may be filed at any time within the period allowed by the practice in the State court for the filing of pleas in bar In the rincipal case however the ruling in these cases is disap proved and it is held in accordance with what would seem to be an authorita tive interpretation of the Removal Act by the Supreme Court of the United States that the petition for removal on the ground of diverse citizenship must be filed before lapse of the period allowed for the filing of pleas in abatement in the State court which practically means that the petition must be filed on or before the return day of the writ This ruling renders of especial importance the question as to when pleas in abatement may be filed in the State court In the principal case it is said obiter that if the declaration be then filed the plea in abatement and hence the petition for removal must be filed not later than the return day of the writ This is undoubtedly true if the defendant fail to appear at the return day of the writsupposing the declaration or bill filed But the defendant may prolong the period within which the plea in abatement may be filed by simply entering his appearance in the clerks office on the return day If he fail to appear on that day a conditional judgement or decree nisi is entered against him Code sec 3984 and by provision of sec 3260 amended by Acts 189798 p 198 no plea in abatement may be filed after a conditional judgment or decree nisi But under sec 3284 if he enter his appearance in the clerks office on the re turn day of the writ instead of a conditional judgment or decree nisi against him he is given a rule to plead which under sec 3239 is to the next rules after the return day So that if he enter his appearance at the first rules as defend ant appears to have done in the principaal case he may file his plea in abatement and hence petition for removal to the Federal court at the second rules since when the plea is offered at the second rules there is no conditional judgment or decree nisi and hence no prohibition against the filing of a plea in abatement under Virginia Code sec 3260 as amendedthe prohibition of that section against filing pleas in abatement being expressly predicated upon a previous conditional judgment or decree nisi See 6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER 484

DECISIONS Syllabi prepared by M P Burks State Reporter THURSTON V HUDGINS AND OTHERSDecided at Richmond Jan uary 24 1895Buchanan J 1 OYSTER INSPECTORSDuties quasi judicialMandamusActs already done The duties imposed upon an oyster inspector under the provisions of sections 2137 and 2153 of the Code relating to the location of oyster grounds are quasi judicial and he cannot be compelled by mandamus to exercise the discretion vested in him in any particular manner Nor will a mandamus lie to compel him to undo what he has done in the exercise of his judgment and discretion and to do what he had already determined should not be done MANGUS V MCCLELLANDDecided at Wytheville June 27 1895 Keith P 1 EQUITABLE DEFENCES AT LAWSec 3299 of CodeA plea by way of special setoff under section 3299 of the Code cannot be relied on which sets up equitable grounds of defence which require a rescission of the contract in suit and a reinvestment of the vendor with the interest alleged to have been sold This defence can only be made in a court of equity 2 CONSTRUCTION OF STATUTESEffect of reenactment after haring been construed Where a statute has been construed by the courts and afterwards reenacted by the legislature the construction given to it by the courts is presumed to have been sanctioned by the legislature and thenceforth becomes obligatory upon the courts EXCHANGE AND DEPOSIT BANK AND OTHERS V FUGATE AND OTH ERsDecided at Richmond January 15 1896Keith P Absent Cardwell and Buchanan JJ 1 USURYSums appropriated to interest by borrower and lenderReeovery back Limitations Where the borrower and the lender have agreed to appropriate and have actually applied payments made by the borrower to the extinguishment of the interest as it accrued on the sum loaned the borrower cannot after the lapse of nearly six years recover back the amounts so paid even though the interest be in excess of the rate allowed by law But where usurious interest is charged in the original note it should be expunged and a decree rendered for the residue with interest thereon from the date of the decree SPILMAN ADAMS  CO V GILPINDecided at Richmond Novem ber 19 1896Keith P Judges Harrison and Buchanan dissenting 1 CHANCERY PRACTICEContinuanceRehearingVerbal agreements of coun The first three cases have only recently been directed to be reported 853VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER selCase at bar Refusal to continue a chancery suit in a proper case for a con tinuance is good ground for a motion to rehear an interlocutory decree but the decree should as a general rule show that a motion for a continuance was made and overruled If however the decree fails to show that the motion was made but it is averred in the petition for rehearing and not denied this is sufficient The granting of a rehearing to an interlocutory decree is a matter within the sound discretion of the court and courts are more liberal in granting rehearings than in reviewing final decrees especially if a case has not been heard on its merits Verbal agreements of counsel especially if disputed will as a rule be disregarded but if such agreement results in surprise to one of the parties and is likely to work injustice to him the court may grant him relief on equitable terms In the case at bar the petition for rehearing presents a case in which the petitioner has a defence to the claim asserted against him which if presented at the proper time would have been a complete answer to the claim but which was not presented at the proper time because petitioners counsel honestly believed that an agree ment existed between him and the opposing counsel that the cause was to await the hearing of another cause in the same court involving the same question in which depositions had been taken and that the depositions should be read in both causes and therefore had not taken proof in petitioners cause Under these cir cumstances the rehearing should have been granted COOL V COMMONWEALTHDecided at Richmond December 3 1896 Keith P 1 CRIMINAL LAwHouse breakingIndictmentTime when offence committed An indictment for breaking and entering a millhouse with intent to commit larceny therein must charge the time at which the alleged breaking and entering took place for if done between February 12 1894 and January 9 1896 the offence was not a felony while if done before the first date or after the latter the offence is a felony Time is of the essence of the offence BENJAMIN  Co v MADDENDecided at Richmond December 3 1896Riely J 1 FRAUD PER SERetention of personal property after salePresumptionCase at barSec 2877 of CodeThe retention of the possession of personal property by the vendor after an absolute sale is primafacie fraudulent against creditors of the vendor but not as against a subsequent purchaser for value without notice of the prior sale but this presumption may be rebutted by proof In the case at bar there was a bonafide sale for value of a stock of goods and delivery of possession and the facts that the vendor did not transfer his license to the vendee before levy on the stock that the name of the vendor upon the window shades which had constituted his only sign remained as before and that the vendor and his former clerk remained in the store and sold goods do not in view of other evidence in the cause establish a case of fraud upon creditors of the vendor Nor under the admitted facts does sec 2877 of the Code apply 854 March

REFUSAL TO CONTINUE A CHANCERY SUIT IN A PROPER CASE FOR A CON TINUANCE IS GOOD GROUND FOR A MOTION TO REHEAR AN INTERLOCUTORY DECREE BUT THE DECREE SHOULD AS A GENERAL RULE SHOW THAT A MOTION FOR A CONTINUANCE WAS MADE AND OVERRULED IF HOWEVER THE DECREE FAILS TO SHOW THAT THE MOTION WAS MADE BUT IT IS AVERRED IN THE PETITION FOR REHEARING AND NOT DENIED THIS IS SUFFICIENT THE GRANTING OF A REHEARING TO AN INTERLOCUTORY DECREE IS A MATTER WITHIN THE SOUND DISCRETION OF THE COURT AND COURTS ARE MORE LIBERAL IN GRANTING REHEARINGS THAN IN REVIEWING FINAL DECREES ESPECIALLY IF A CASE HAS NOT BEEN HEARD ON ITS MERITS VERBAL AGREEMENTS OF COUNSEL ESPECIALLY IF DISPUTED WILL AS A RULE BE DISREGARDED BUT IF SUCH AGREEMENT RESULTS IN SURPRISE TO ONE OF THE PARTIES AND IS LIKELY TO WORK INJUSTICE TO HIM THE COURT MAY GRANT HIM RELIEF ON EQUITABLE TERMS IN THE CASE AT BAR THE PETITION FOR REHEARING PRESENTS A CASE IN WHICH THE PETITIONER HAS A DEFENCE TO THE CLAIM ASSERTED AGAINST HIM WHICH IF PRESENTED AT THE PROPER TIME WOULD HAVE BEEN A COMPLETE ANSWER TO THE CLAIM BUT WHICH WAS NOT PRESENTED AT THE PROPER TIME BECAUSE PETITIONERS COUNSEL HONESTLY BELIEVED THAT AN AGREE MENT EXISTED BETWEEN HIM AND THE OPPOSING COUNSEL THAT THE CAUSE WAS TO AWAIT THE HEARING OF ANOTHER CAUSE IN THE SAME COURT INVOLVING THE SAME QUESTION IN WHICH DEPOSITIONS HAD BEEN TAKEN AND THAT THE

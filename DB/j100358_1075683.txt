COMMITTEE APPOINTED BY THE ENGLISH CONFERENCE TO INQUIRE INTO THE TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOLS OF THE MIDDLE WEST GEORGE W TANNER Murray F Tuley High School Chicago At the last meeting of this conference held in November 19o4 this committee was appointed to investigate and report on the teaching of English in the high schools of the Middle West with special reference to the College Entrance Requirements and the attitude of the highschool teachers toward those require ments The committee was instructed to include outside or home reading also within the scope of its inquiry In committee it was decided to take the conference schools as typical of the schools of the Middle West The following questions were prepared and sent to each of the schools on the conference list I What books are taken up in class during each year of the English course in your school II If you have any objections a to the College Entrance Requirements or b to the new list approved for IgogII either for general reading or for study and practice please state them concisely III If you are dissatisfied with the abovementioned lists will you make out a suggestive list to take their place IV Is the student required to do any general reading outside of that mentioned in I home reading  How many books in each year V A Are these books the same for all the pupils of one year V B If so give the titles of those required during the year I9045 V C If not give the lists from which selections may be made V D What is the principle governing the makingout of these lists V E How do you determine the care with which these books have been read  The replies to these questions were tabulated first in order to discover if there is any marked unanimity among the teachers as to the best books to be read both in and out olf class and second to present to the conference teachers in condensed form 32TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN MIDDLE WEST 33 the results of the experience of other teachers in the matter of general or home reading The following report is in sum only a presentation of the tabulated results but it is hoped by the com mittee that it may be productive of subjects for discussion and may be as helpful to all the teachers in suglgesting various methods which may be tried as it has been to those who analyzed the various answers Upon considering the replies to the first question it was thought that it might interest the teachers to know the amount of reading done by different schools Accordingly Table I was pre pared The body of the table shows the number of schools in which are read the number of books indicated in the first column It appears that in the schools which replied 67 in all 4 books is the popular number for required firstyear reading with 3 books close to it in the second year 4 books ranks highest with 5 books a close second in the third year 4 and 6 are the two highest while in the fourth year the numbers go up to 6 and 7 In some schools the readings which were listed were evidently illustrative selections to accompany a course in literature and the number of titles given in one case was over forty Such cases are tabulated as indefinite TABLE I NUMBER OF

Requirements would show itself in a narrow range of books read But to their surprise the exact reverse was found to be the case as shown by the following figures In the 67 schools that replied to the questions 82 different books were listed as firstyear reading 92 as second year reading 102 as thirdyear reading and 107 as fourthyear reading The popular books in the different years are shown in the following lists the number following each book indicating the number of schools in which that book is used In these lists no book appears which was not reported from the same year in at least five schools FIRST YEAR The Vision of Sir Launfal 24 The Sketch Book 23 The Lady of the Lake 16 Ivanhoe i6 The Merchant of Venice 12 The Last of the Mohicans 9 Silas Marner 9 Tales of the White Hills 9 The

is placed in most schools Table II was prepared In this table the numbers refer to schools e g Julius Caesar is placed in the first year in 7 schools in the second year in 39 schools in the third year in Io schools and in the fourth year in 5 schools Sixtyone schools out of 67 have it somewhere in their courses In this table as in the previous lists no book appears which is not used in the same year in at least 5 schools with the exception of the last one which appeared worthy of special mention as indicating the progress of a new movement in Englishteaching in the direction of added interest for the pupils The question naturally arises To what extent do these lists represent the real choice olf the teachers and to what extent are they influenced by the College Entrance Requirements At the time these lists were made out the requirements for 19o068 affected all but the pupils at that time in first year An asterisk36 THE SCHOOL REVIEW TABLE II SHOWING BY YEARS THE

Requirements 190911 marks those books which are on the list of requirements either for study and practice or for reading for the years 19o68 and a dagger after the title indicates those books which are on the list of requirements for 19o9 Ii The asterisk therefore should be noted in connection with the second third and fourth years as shown in the table and the dagger in connection with the first year It would appear from this table that the College Entrance Requirements have to say the least a strong influence on the choice of books read though what the courses would have been had the teachers been free to make their selections the committee had of course no means of learning Some light is thrown upon this point by the answers to Question II Before leaving this question it is perhaps worth noting that no one of the requirements is to be found in all the schools that Macaulays Johnson though required for study and practice for 19o068 is found in only onethird of the schools and that Macaulays Milton though dropped from the requirements still retains its place in nearly half the schoolsTEACHING OF ENGLISH IN MIDDLE WEST 37 The answers to Question II show that the teachers generally do not approve of the present college requirements Of the 67 replies 40 contained some objection Ii expressed satisfaction and 16 did not answer that question Most of the objections were to particular books as shown by the following list The numbers show how many objected Books too difficult or not suited to the presentday needs of highschool pupils Burkes Conciliation 13 Macaulays Ad

Elaine  I  Other objections were as follows Lists not sufficiently broad 8 no continuity 5 not adapted to any scheme of rhetoric i prose overbalances poetry 2 English literature over balances American I not enough modern literature i nothing from the literature of science I selections too heavy 3 They seem to deaden any love for literature a pupil may have is the way one teacher expressed it two of Macaulays essays unprofitable 6 should be permitted to use the lists for 1909II now I  entrance should be by diploma I That the list for 19o9II is considered a great improvement is shown by the fact that of the 67 schools only i i objected 28 expressed themselves as satisfied and 28 said nothing This list also received commendations from a number of schools Again the objections are largely to particular books Besides the books already mentioned Emerson Webster and The House of the Seven Gables are mentioned once each as being too difficult or un suitable The Ancient Mariner Silas Marner Ivanhoe and The House of the Seven Gables are listed once each as worthy of being in the critical study group Sir Roger de Coverley is objected to as not being Addisons best work To quote from one answer Macaulays Milton should be retained His Addison and John son are arranged on a chronological basis and do not offer the same opportunities for the study of the organization of material38 THE SCHOOL REVIEW as his Milton This presupposes that the essays are studied as models of exposition Other criticisms of a more general nature are Group VI too good to have all but two omitted I selections of the same group of unequal value e g Chaucers Prologue and The De serted Village 2 study list not sufficiently broad I essay and oration given undue prominence I One answer sums the matter up as follows The principle is wrong Study list is too short Attempt to prescribe for the schools within such narrow limits is impertinent The commendations are as follows More latitude 8 American authors on list 2 more good fiction I time in fourth year for contemporary writers I but one essay of Macaulay I The following summingup of the matter from the answer of the Milwaukee Downer College seems worthy of being quoted in full The new list has the advantage of giving a wider range to choose from and in the hands of a wise teacher who has in mind the unity of literature and knows how to correlate subjects and where to place emphasis regardless of her own personal likes and dislikes such an opportunity for choice should bring desirable results If the subjects could be distributed according to years of the course to fit into a definite uniform standard of teaching litera ture the list would not tend to produce scattering futile results as is so often the case More depends upon the general aim of the course the large view of the whole four years training than upon the mere insistence upon the reading of this that or the other masterpiece The subjects are all taught too much as a mere medium for giving information about subject matter or for vapid moralizing and too little for their intrinsic merit as works of art and for the perfect models they furnish for students composition Summing up the objections and commendations it seems that a broadening oif the College Entrance Requirements is what is needed to meet the various conditions in different schools and the different personalities of the teachers One teacher finds that The House of the Seven Gables does not appeal to her pupils another wants it put on the list for critical study From one school comes the complaint that the majority of the pupils haveTEACHING OF ENGLISH IN MIDDLE WEST 39 never read a book outside of school while other schools have pupils capable of studying Burke Macaulay and Carlyle in the second year Surely it appears illadvised if not impertinent to prescribe the same courses for these various schools From the nature of the objections already mentioned it fol lows that most of the suggestions given in the answers to Ques tion III are for individual substitutions It seemed to the com mittee hardly worth while to set them down in this report inas much as no two are alike and not one of them outlines a complete course They are on file with Mr Linn of the English depart ment of the University in case this conference decides to follow the matter up and work out a suggestive course of study Some of the more general suggestions are The study of American writers in such order as to illustrate rhetoric study in the first year and the same for English writers in the second and third years a chronological study of English literature with selections to illustrate Make the course as extensive as it can be made It is not of so much concern what particular author is read as the spirit that enters into the reading Texts are so little and the power of personality is so great that each school must work out its own problems College entrance examinations should as a rule not be on the books read but on passages that the pupil never saw before and should show his power not memorywhat he can get from a selection not what the teacher has crammed him with Teachers and pupils should have more liberty There should be a very long list or none at all When pupils go to college let them be judged by their ability to write and speak on what masterpieces they knowmasterpieces they have had some part in selecting Let there be a more liberal interpre tation of the term intensive study than is indicated by the exami nation questions set by many colleges in which technicalities of diction are called for that teachers themselves might have to look up Secure uniformity not so much through choice of subject matter as through a common aim in teaching the subject Examiners in their questions should take into account the fact that these boys and girls cannot have the maturity of judgment that comes with years of study and research The examinations40 THE SCHOOL REVIEW should call for appreciation and partial interpretation rather than masterly criticism From the foregoing it would appear that a broad list to gether with a broad view in making out the examination ques tions would meet the objections of practically all the teachers We have so far dwelt chiefly upon the objections to the requirementsi To be fair we must bear in mind the fact that I I schools are satisfied with the requirements as they now stand and 28 are satisfied with the requirements for o909I I In one case however this satisfaction was expressed as follows They are as good as any lists could be which may be variously inter preted It is a pity that for the purpose of a complete presenta tion of the subject those who favor the requirements did not give their reasons but the fault lies with the committee as the word ing of the questions would not call for such a statement It is hoped that this may be remedied in the discussion and that both sides may have a full and fair hearing A different note is sounded in the following This questionaire to my mind touches only the hem of the subject of College Entrance Requirements in English The reading is not the important part of the subject Composition is the garment What colleges are asking for as far as I can find out is not knowledge of books but the ability to write clear correct English Of course reading aids composition in many persons but not to any great extent in students preparing for college The colleges are right in asking for clear correct expression for it is handmaid to all other subjects If a student does not enter college expres sion both written and oral is still the important branch for him to master In my experience I have noticed that if the taste for writing is cultivated the student desires to read Of course students differ The master has to work with the individual This is the whole Law and the Prophets This concludes that part of the questionaire which deals with the College Entrance Requirements The committee has en deavored to place before you the gist of the replies in the spirit in which they seemed to be written and to avoid as far as possible all personal bias If such bias appears in the report the com mittee pleads that it was forced in by the evidence not carried in consciously Leaving this matter then in the hands of the con ference we will pass to the consideration of the second general subject treated of the subject of outside or home readingTEACHING OF ENGLISH IN MIDDLE WEST 41 From the answers to Question IV it appears to be the opinion of nearly all teachers that outside reading should be controlled to some extent by the English teachers Of the 67 schools 55 require it 3 advise it 6 do not require it and 3 did not answer Table III shows the number of books required or advised in each year The figures in the body of the table again refer to schools The numbers for the different years do not foot up the same because in some schools the course is but three years long so that no answer was given for one year and because in some cases the answer was incomplete TABLE III NUMBER OF BOOKS READ OUTSIDE OF CLASS BY YEARS

five books or fewer is the general practice Question V asks Are these books the same for all the pupils of one year The answers are yes i I no 39 part optional and part required 7 no answer I Of those schools that require all the pupils to read the same books four except the fourth year and of those that allow the pupil to select within limits his readings I excepts the third year and i the fourth year Upon taking up the lists of books for outside reading the42 THE SCHOOL REVIEW committee found itself somewhat at a loss just what to do The lists themselves are so full of suggestions that it is very much to be regretted that they cannot be given here An attempt was made however to extract from them some general conclusions which it is hoped will be of interest Considering first the lists sent in from schools where all the pupils of one year are required to read the same books it was hoped to find some common ground some 3 or 4 or 5 books which were considered by a fair number of teachers as essential It was found that the most popular book was Ivanhoe required in Io schools olf the 18 that fall within this group But this book is one of the College Entrance Requirements which seemed to rob it largely of its value as an index of the teachers choice Search was then made for the most popular book not on the list of requirements This was found to be The Last of the Mohicans used in 7 schools After careful consideration it was decided that any list in which the most popular book was the choice of only about onethird of the teachers would be more misleading than helpful The plan olf making such a list was therefore abandoned The attention of the compilers was then directed toward the nature of the lists as a whole and the apparent aim of the teach ers who made them out This ground is partly covered by the replies to question VD and those who looked over the papers congratulated themselves upon the close agreement between their analysis and the expressed aim of the teachers It seemed to the committee that their analysis was a little more detailed in most instances and therefore it is given here in Table IV It should be borne in mind that this table refers only to those books which are required as outside reading from all the members of one year Under the headingSupplementary to Class Reading are grouped the following classes a other books by the same authors as those read in class b biographies of authors studied in class c books illustrative of the times of the authors studied in class and d readings to accompany a study of the history of

English literature chronologically Romantic poetry 4 9 I I   3 8 8 I   4 9 4 3  4 6 8 I I Among the schools where all the pupils of one year are not required to read the same books a wide divergence in aim and method obtains Some teachers allow a choice from a compara tively short list 20 or 30 books others have lists of 200 or 300 books from which the pupils may select at will In one school the school library of 2000 volumes is the field in which the pupils may browse and that may be supplemented at the option of the teachers Any attempt to compile a list of books favored by the majority of teachers would of course in such circumstances be a failure In fact in many instances no list of books was sub mitted the remark being made that the pupils were allowed to choose at will subject to the approval of the teacher Two sharply contrasting points of view as to method were presented in the replies In some schools the titles are arranged in groups and the pupils are required to read one or two books of each group Illustrative of this plan one list for firstyear reading calls for one book from each of the following classes I Cooper II American poets III short stories IV Haw thorne V narrative poems VI Scott novels By this means a wellrounded course of reading is aimed at As opposed to this method the following statement is quoted from one reply I know of no better way to kill interest in reading than the plan of requir ing the reading of certain books What should be a pleasure becomes toil in most cases The better way as it seems to me is to stock a library with good books and let the pupils choose for themselves All day long they44 THE SCHOOL REVIEW have acquired knowledge from books under a rigid system of school govern ment and instruction why not give them entire freedom when they go to the library A large majority of the teachers take a middle ground not requiring strict adherence to any predetermined outline but not allowing the pupil absolute freedom Upon reading the lists and the accompanying statements the committee reached the conclu sion that in the majority of cases the attempt is made by the teachers to ascertain the individual needs of the pupils and by personal influence to guard against a narrow course of reading Another device to secure interest in the home reading is re ported from one school Lists of readings arranged in groups are prepared to accompany each course in English and additional credit is given to any student who reads a certain number of books from each of the groups The number required is one for some courses and two for others The lists are worthy of notice as being with one exception the only ones reported which con tained the Bible The groups for most of the courses are I Bible II poetry III history biography miscellaneous IV fiction The selections vary in difficulty with the various courses and in the highest course is added a group made up of magazines and newspapers The principles underlying the preparation of the homereading lists were reduced to the following supplementary to class reading correlation with history courses individual needs of the pupils first year wide acquaintance with books later with par ticular authors to guide those who wish an orderly course in reading to encourage pupils to select from many kinds of litera ture to raise the standard of reading by gradual steps To quote one reply in full The lists are the combined judgments of each group of teachers as to what the pupils like coupled with some ideal as to what they ought to like The object is solely to carry the pupils over from the trashy material they have been reading into good literature No instruction is aimed at simply the development of good taste in reading The means taken to learn how carefully the outside reading has been done are given as follows discussions with writtenTEACHING OF ENGLISH IN MIDDLE WEST 45 tests 20 discussions with themes I I reports oral and written 8 written tests 7  book reviews 4  discussions in class 3 discussions outside of class 3 notebooks 3 starchamber examinations I This concludes the inquiry conducted by the committee and it now submits this report to the conference for such action as the conference may see fit to take In such a summary as this many matters of interest were necessarily omitted but it is hoped that enough were retained to give the report a certain value in the eyes of the teachers In conclusion the members of the com mittee wish to express their sincere thanks to the chairman of the conference Mr Linn for the assistance he gave them in indicat ing lines of inquiry in the analysis of the replies and for his helpful criticisms of the report as it was being prepared and also to Mr Hosic of the Chicago Normal School for his careful reading of the report and the suggestions he made for its improvement

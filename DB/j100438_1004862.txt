KINSON EsQ by Mr R PATTERSON Read Mar HII E happy influence of mufic on the human 71788 1 charaer is univerfally acknowledged what ever therefore may have a tendency to facilitate the pro grefs of this fcience will not I am perfuaded be thought unworthy of your notice I have long regretted that the art of printing which more than any other modern invention has contributed to the progrefs of trfeful knowledge amnong men has in the fcience of mufic been hitherto exercifed in fo limited a degree It is true there is a method of printing mufic by types made for the purpofe few printers however efpecially in America are furniffied with founts of this kind and in general when one would publifh a piece of mnufic he is obliged to have recourfe to the troublefome and expenfive mode of a copperplate impreffilon and hence it is that publicationfs of this kind are fo very rate anmong us and yet J apprehend that no good reafon can be giv en why mufical founds might not be reprefented by the common alphabetical charaSters as well as tie articulate founds of a language In mufical founds Iwo things you know Sir are chiefly to be confidered namnely tone and time The latter according to the common notation is denoted by peculiar charaaters appropriated to the different lengths or intervals of the mufical founds and the tones them felves by lines and fpaces on which the aforeraid charac ters are placed Muficians have been long agreed to de nominate thefe lines and fpaces by the feven firft letters of the alphabet now if the tones of mufical notes inflead S 2 of140 New NOTATION OF MUSTC of being reprefented by lines and fpaces were denoted by the letters which denominate thefe and their times by the common flops or marks of pauife in reading fubjoined to the letters this notation of mufic would certainly be as natural as the common one and would moreover have this great advantage that mufic might then be printed with the common alphabetical types by which means all the in convenience and expence attending the publication of mu fic according to the ufual notation woiild be avoided a magazine or common newspaper would then become a convenient vehicle for publifhing the moft celebrated airs or pieces of mufic which any one might afterwards if he fhould think it neceffary prick off for himfelf in the common form and thus contribute to diffufe a more ge neral knowledge of this ornamental and hlumanizing fci ence To explain this matter more fully Let the feven notes a b c d e f g on one of whidh the cliff is plac ed be printed in frnall Roman letters the feven notes next above thefe in fmall Italics the next feven when any of them fhall occur in Italiccapitals and the feven notes below the cliffodave in Roman capitals Thefe four odtaves vilz A B C

beginning of a tune when tranfpof ed from its natural key as atfo the cliff time mood or other circumflance may be expreffed in words at length after the title of the tune Accidental flats fharps and naturals to deviate as little as poflible from the common notation I would exprefs as follows the flat by a fmall b placed before the note affedced and fet a little higher than the other letters in the line This may be done ei ther by ufing a letter of a fialler body and Ijacing it up orNEw NOTATION or MUSIC 14t or by what printers call a frperior letter fuclh as are com 7monly ufed for notes of reference The pofition and fize of this b will fufficiently diftinguilf it from the note of that name The afteriirn or if it fhould be thought better a fmall x placed before the note will very well ex prefs an accidental fiharp and the letter n a natural arid though tlhefe charaaers for fharps and naturals can never be miflaken for notes yet for the fake of uniformi ty and to prevent all poiible embarraffment in reading I would place them alfo a little higher than the other letters in the line Two or more notes founded together as is frequent on clarvicords harps and other ilfringed inftru rnents may be expreffed by fetting fuch notes one over the other As for the times of notes which is the fecond thing to be conCidered in mufical founds they may I think be very naturally expreffed by the following marks which are ufied for a fimilar purpofe in common reading Semidemiquavers which are fung or played as rapid ly as the fyllables of a word are pronounced may be ex preffed by the hyphen which in reading only feparates fyllables placed after fuch notes  Semiquavers by the comma  QMavers by the femicolon  Crotchets by the colon   Miniums by the period  And femibreves Iy the m dafh  A pricked note may be expreffed as in common nota tion by an inverted period let after the mark fignifying the time of the note When two or more notes of equal time come together in the fame bar the mark of time need only be expreffed after the lafi of fuch notes and underflood to the reft and the different fyllables in a bar may when it is thought neceffary be diflinguidhed by interpofing a fpace between fuich fyllables Refts142 NEW NOTATION OQ MUSIC Refis will be very well expreffed by the foregoing rec fpeative marks of time fet alone or not immediately pre ceded by a note A fingle bai

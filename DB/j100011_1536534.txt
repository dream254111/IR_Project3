periments on unicellular organisms and Echinoderm eggs it was found necessary to construct a micropipette that could be more readily and more accurately controlled than could either Bar bers1 pipette or Chamberss2 modification of the same An apparatus was needed with which it was possible not only to inject definite amounts of fluid and extract special parts of cells but also with which these could be electrically stimulated Such an apparatus was devised and although it was only in the process of being perfected nevertheless with it fluid could be injected and the membrane and other parts of Echinoderm eggs extracted and these as well as unicellular organisms electrically stimulated It was possible for instance to stimulate different parts of Vorticella and to determine that the contractile sub stance of the stalk of this special species differed from the con tractile substance of the frogs striated muscle fibers in that it did not follow the law of All or Nothing which was discov ered for these muscle cells by Pratt4 with his very valuable and interesting microelectrode The results pertaining to my ex periments with these devises will be published in the near future At present only the microelectrode imperfect though it be shall be described in the hope that it will be improved by some one who has the opportunity and is interested in the experimental fields requiring its use The microelectrodes are Barber pipettes so modified as to be employed for unipolar stimulation They are glass tubes about twelve centimeters long six millimeters in diameter and drawn 1 From the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory and the University of Kansas 1 Barber M A The Philippine Jr Sc Sec Trop Med 9 307 2 Chambers R Am Jr Phys I9o1 p 189 BIOL BULL 1918 34 P 121 3

one The other end of the glass pipettes are more or less bent If they contain mercury they have a platinum wire sol dered into them and are fitted airtight with rubber tubing and clamps The rubber tubing and clamp are supported on a pulley that allows this end to be raised or lowered thus aiding in the adjustment of the mercury in the bent tip The pipettes are supported and regulated on the microscopic stage of the Barber pipette holder and their tips are operated inside of a Barber moist chamber The pipettes may contain mercury or some electrolytic solu tion Or the indifferent one mercury and the active one a solu tion or partly mercury and only the tip a solution Or both pipettes may contain fine wire The active one connected with Pratts glasscoated platinum tip sharpened to a point of 8 mi crons and the indifferent one platinum Or it may be platinum and the active one contain an electrolyte When nonpolarizable Porter boot electrodes are introduced in the circuit the pipettes and the dish containing the boots may be filled with sea water Or by means of pressure applied from the rubber capped end of the pipette mercury can be forced toward the tip Then by diminishing the pressure it can be brought back into the capillary a certain distance drawing after it some of the solution desired from a hanging drop in the moist chamber An equilibrium is then established that will remain constant as long as the condi tions are not changed Or the active pipette electrode may be filled with mercury either in accordance with Barbers method or filled under pressure as far as possible and then placed with the indifferent electrode in contact with a mercury hanging drop If now the circuit from a battery is closed the current enter ing the anode traverses the hanging drop and the cathode At the moment of the establishment of the current the equilibrium of forces that holds the mercury at a certain point in the capillary is disturbed The end of the fine thread of mercury moves up ward or downward a certain distance owing to a change in sur 131I H HYDE face tension The direction and distance of the movement de pends of course upon the strength and direction of the current introduced into the active pipette When the mercury is brought to the tip of this the pressure clamp is closed the mercury held near the top which may end in a drop of the same solution that surrounds the organism that is to be stimulated If the active electrode be cathodal a stimulus of a minimal break shock will stimulate for instance the stalk or any desired part of a Vorticella that is in the hanging drop and near contact with the active electrode and the effect of the stimulation is observed under the microscope A diagram of one microelectrode is shown in Fig I

movements of the mercury due to changes in surface ten sion by a force sufficient to overcome capillary attraction in augurated by the passage of an electrical current made it pos sible to employ this devise as a capillary electrode The fact that the meniscus of mercury moves more or less in either direction in the tip of the micropipette by altering the strength and direction of the current and thus ejecting a solution that lies between the mercury and the tip of the micropipette or drawing in a solution due to suction led to the idea that it could be adapted for the injection or extraction of minute quantities of substances from unicellular structures But the mechanism needs further improvements before it can be satisfactorily em ployed for very accurate work I therefore was agreeably surprised while this paper was going 132A MICROELECTRODE 133 to press to find that Taylor1 devised an accurately controllable micropipette that seemed to fulfill the requirements of the apparatus needed for injection and extraction I believe that by soldering plantinum wire into the capillary containing the mer cury and connecting it to batteries comutator and coil that it will answer equally well for electrical stimulation 1 Taylor C V Science 1920 June i8

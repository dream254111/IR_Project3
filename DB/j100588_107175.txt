J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107175,SOME ACCOUNT OF TWO MUMMIES OF THE EGYPTIAN IBIS ONE OF WHICH WAS IN A REMARKABLY PERFECT STATE,I206960,XVIII SOMTE ACCCOUNIT OF TWO MUINRNIES OF THE EGYPTIAN IBIS ONE OF WHICH WAS INL A REMNARKABLY PERFECT STATE BY JOHN PEARSON ESQ FRS READ JUNE 13 1805 TH1 E ANCIENT EGYPTIALIS WERE NOT MORE REMARKABLE FOR THEIR ATTAINMENTS IN SCIENCE THAN FOR THE EXTRAORDINARY ATTENTION THEY PAID TO THE BODIES OF THEIR DECEASED RELATIVES PRESERVING THEIR REMNAINS BY ARTS WHICH ARE NOW EITHER UNKNOWN OR IMPERFECTLY RECO RDED AND DEPOSITING THEM IN SUBTERRANEAN STRUCTURES WHICH TO THIS DAY EXCITE THE CURIOSITY AND WONDER OF THE PHILOSOPHIC TRAVELLER THE PRACTICE OF EMBALMING WAS NOT CONFINED AS IS WELL KNOWN TO THE CONSERVATION OF HUMAN BODIES EXCLUSIVELY IT WAS LIKEWISE EMPLOYED TO PROTECT THE REMAINS OF SEVERAL OF THEIR SACRED ANIMALS FROM THAT DECAY AND DISSOLUTION WHICH USUALLY ENSUES ON THE EXPOSURE OF ANIMAL SUBSTANCES TO THE ACTION OF THE EARTH OR OF THE ATMOSPHERE WE LEARN FROM HERODOTIUS THAT AMONG THE DIFFERENT ANIMALS WHICH THE EGYPTIANS HONOURED WITH THIS PECULIAR MODE OF SEPULTURE WERE THE CAT THE ICHNEUMON THE MUS ARANEUS TER RESTRIS THE IBIS AND THE HAWK  BUT WHETHER THIS BE A COMPLETE ENUMERATION OR NOT IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE AT THIS PERIOD OF TINE TO DETERMINE MUMMIES OF THE HAWK AND OF THE IBIS HAVE BEEN OFTEN DRAWN OUT OF THE CATACOMBS AND OLIVIER ASSERTS THAT HE HAS NOT ONLY MET WITH THE BONES OF THE MUS  EUTERPEMR PEARSONS ACCOUNT OF TWO AMUMMIES C 65 ARANEUS TERRESTRIS BUT ALSO WITH THOSE OF SEVERAL OF THE SMALLER SPECIES OF QUADRUPEDS AND THAT THE BONES OF DIFFERENT ANIMALS ARE NOT UNFREQUENTLY CONTAINED WITHIN THE SAME WRAPPER IT IS HOWEVER CONFIDENTLY AFFIRMED BY DIFFERENT WRITERS THAT THE MORE MODERN EGYPTIANS HAVE FREQUENTLY INCLUDED A SINGLE BONE OF SOME QUADRUPED WITHIN THE USUAL QUANTITY OF CLOTH WHICH THEY HAVE ARTFULLY TAKEN FROM SOME DECAYED MUMMY IN THE CATACOMBS AND THEN FRAUDULENTLY SOLD THIS SOPHISTICATED PRODUCTION AS AN ANCIENT MUMMY HENCE ANY GENERAL CON CLUSIONS FOUNDED ON MEETING WITH THE BONES OF OTHER QUADRU PEDS MUST BE RECEIVED WITH DIFFIDENCE AND SUSPICIONT THE MUMMIES WHICH ARE TAKEN OUT OF THE CATACOMBS OF THE BIRDS AT SACCARA AND AT THEBES ARE INCLUDED IN EARTHEN JARS CLOSED WITH A COVER OF THE SAME MATERIAL THE CLOTH WHICH ENVELOPES THE MUMMY IS SOMETIMES TOLERABLY FIRM AND PERFECT BUT ON REMOVING THIS WE COMMONLY MEET WITH A QUANTITY OF DUST RESEMBLING POWDERED CHARCOAL IN ITS APPEARANCE INTER MIXED WITH THE BONES OR THE FRAGMENTS OF BONES BELONGING TO THE CREATURE WHICH HAD BEEN CONTAINED IN IT THE DECOMPOSITION IS OFTEN SO COMPLETE THAT NO TRACES OF THE ANIMAL REMAIN BUT ON OTHER OCCASIONS THE INTIRE COLLECTION OF BONES WITH THE BILL OF THE BIRD HAVE BEEN FOUND IN A CONDITION SUFFICIENTLY PERFECT TO CONSTRUCT A SKELETON WITH THEM IN THE FOURTH VOLUME OF THE ANNALES DIZ IAUSEZUM NEZTIONAL DHISTOIRE NATURELLE NM CUVIER HAS PUBLISHED AN INTERESTING ME MOIR ON THE IBIS WITH AN ENGRAVING OF THE SLKELETON OF THAT BIRD WHICH HAD BEEN FORMED OF THE BONES COLLECTED FROM THE CATACOMBS AT THEBES THAT ABLE

MUMMIES ASSIGNS IT A PLACE AMONG THE SPECIES OF CURLEW UNDER THE NAME OF NUMENIUS IBIS THE ACCOUNTS OF THE MUMMY OF THE IBIS WHICH HAVE BEEN NITHERTO MADE PUBLIC WERE COLLECTED FROM OBSERVATIONS MADE ON IT IN A DECAYED STATE I PRESUME THEREFORE THAT A DESCRIP TION OF THE MUMMY OF AN IBIS IN A CONDITION UNUSUALLY PERFECT MAY NOT BE UNACCEPTABLE TO THE CURIOUS AMONG THE CURIOSITIES NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL WHICH WERE COLLECTED BY THE LATE MAJOR HAYES IN THE YEARS I8O2 AND 18 03WERE TWO SMALL MUMMIES WHICH HE TOOK OUT OF THE CATACOMBS AT THEBES IN UPPER EGYPT THEY WERE CONTAINED IN EARTHEN JARS AND WERE ENVELOPED IN CLOTH SIMILAR TO THOSE WHICH ARE BROUGHT FROM SACCARA AT THE REQUEST OF HIS FAMILY I FIRST EXAMINED THE LARGER OF THE TWO AND FOUND THE COVERING TO CONSIST OF BANDAGES OF CLOTH STRONG AND FIRM AND ABOUT THREE INCHES BROAD THE FIRST CIRCUMVO LUTIONS OF THE ROLLER SEPARATED EASILY BUT AS I PROCEEDED THEY ADHERED MORE FIRMLY TO EACH OTHER AND WERE AT LENGTH SO CLOSELY CEMENTED TOGETHER BY A RESINOUSLIKE SUBSTANCE THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO DIVIDE THE FOLDS OF THE CLOTH WITH A STRONG KNLIFE EACH LAYER OF THE BANDAGE APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN IN BUED WITH SOME BITUMINOUS OR RESINOUS SUBSTANCE IN A LIQUID STATE AND THE ROLLER WAS FARTHER SECURED BY STRONG PIECES OF THREAD SO THAT THE WHOLE MASS WVAS RENDERED EXTREMELY HARD AND COHERENT WHEN I HAD REMOVED THE GREATER PART OF THE 1OVERING I FOUND THAT IT HAD CONTAINED A BIRD WHICH WAS TLIICKLY COVERED WITH THE SAME KIND OF SUBSTANCE THAT HAD CEMENTED THE DIFFERENT STRIPS OF THE ROLLER THE EXAMINATION  THIS ACCOMPLISHED YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO SERVED DURING THE LATE CAMPAIGN ILL EGYPT DIED JULY 26 1803 AT ROSETTA AGED Z5 YEARS BY HIS PREMATURE DEATH HIS AUNTRY LOST AN ABLE OFFICER AND A ZEALOUS PROMOTER OF THE INTERESTS OF SCIENCEOF THE EGYPTIAN IBIS 67 WAS NOW CARRIED ON MORE SLOWLY BY PICKING OUT CAREFULLY ALL THE LOOSE BITUMINOUS MATTER THAT COULD BE REMOVED WITHOUT INJURING THE MUMMY AND AFTER THE LABOUR OF MANY HOURS I SUCCEEDED IN DISPLAYING THE WHOLE BIRD AS IT HAD BEEN DEPO SITED BY THE EMBALMER THE OPERATOR WHO HAD EMBALMED THIS BIRD HAD PREVIOUSLY DISPOSED ITS SEVERAL PARTS WITH GREAT ORDER AND REGULARITY THE NECK WAS TWISTED SO AS TO PLACE THE VERTEX OF THE HEAD ON THE BODY OF THE BIRD A LITTLE TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE STERNUM THE CURVED BILL WITH ITS CONCAVE PART TURNED UPWARDS DE SCENDED BETWEEN THE FEET AND REACHED TO THE EXTREMITY OF THE TAIL EACH FOOT WITH ITS FOUR CLAWS TURNED FORWARDS WAS BENT UPWARDS AND PLACED ON EACH SIDE OF THE HEAD THE WINGS WERE BROUGHT CLOSE TO THE SIDES OF THE BODY IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO REMOVE MUCH OF THE BITUMINOUS MATTER FROM THE BACK AND WINGS WITHOUT INJURING THE MUMMY BUT I TOOK AWAY A QUAN TITY SUFFICIENT TO SHOW THATTHE PLUMAGE WAS WHITE THE FEATHERS BEING TIPPED WITH DARK BROWN AT THEIR EXTREMITIES I COULD NOT HOWEVER UNCOVER THE TAIL FEATHERS SO AS TO DETERMINE THEIR COLOUR THE BIRD HAD ATTAINED ITS FULL GROWTH FOR THE QUILLS OF ONE WING WHICH HAD SUFFERED SOME INJURY IN REMOVING THE BANDAGE WERE IN A PERFECT STATE THE LARGEST OF THESE QUILLS IS DELINEATED OF THE NATURAL SIZE IN THE ANNEXED PLATE THE FOLLOWING ARE THE DIMENSIONS OF SUCH PARTS OF THE IBIS AS ARE ACCESSIBLE LENGTH OF THE BIRD FROM THE TERMINATION OF THE NECK INCHES TO THE EXTREMITY OF THE TAIL   12 LENGTH OF THE NECK IN WHICH TEN VERTEBRA CAN BE TRACED

EXHIBITING NO PARTICULAR MARKS OF DECAY ALTHOUGH IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE GREATER PART OF 3000 YEARS HAS ELAPSED SINCE IT WAS INTERRED FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF THE EGYPTIAN THEBES IS OF AN EARLIER DATE THAN THE FOUNDATION OF ANY CITY NOW EXISTING THE AP PEARANCE OF THE MUMMY RENDERS IT PROBABLE THAT THE BIRD WAS IMMERSED IN THE BITUMINOUS MATTER WHEN IT WAS IN A LIQUID STATE AND CAPABLE OF INSINUATING ITSELF INTO ALL THE INEQUALITIES ON THE SURFACE OF THE BODY THE SEVERAL FOLDS OF THE BANDAGE MUST HAVE BEEN LIKEWISE COVERED WITH THE SAME VARNISH BUT THE ANIMAL WAS CERTAINLY NOT BOILED IN THE LIQUID AS GREW SUPPOSED SINCE THE FEATHERS ARE NOT AT ALL CORRUGATED NOR INDEED MATERIALLY CHANGED FROM THEIR NATURAL APPEARANCE THE EXAMINATION OF DIFFERENT MUM11MIES OF THE IBIS PROVES INDU BITABLY THAT THE SAME CARE HAS NOT BEEN USED NOR HAVE THE SAME METHODS BEEN FOLLOWED IN THE PREPARING OF THEM BUT WHETHER THE DIFFERENCE OBSERVED DEPENDED UPON THE CONDITION OF TIE BIRD WHEN IT WAS EMBALMED OR UPON THE UNEQUAL SKILL AND DILIGENCE OF THE OPERATORS CANNOT NOW BE ASCERTAINED THIS HOWEVER IS SUFFICIENTLY EVIDENT THAT THE VARIETY EXHIBITED IN THEIR APPEARANCE DOES NOT DEPEND ON THE PLACE WHERE THE BIRD WAS DEPOSITED SINCE MANY MUMMIES OF BIRDS HAVE BEEN TAKEN MUSAWIM REGALIS SOCIETATIS ZOF THE EGYPTIAN IBISI 269 FROM THE CATACOMBS AT THEBES IN AS IMPERFECT AND DECAYED A CONDITION AS THOSE WHICH HAVE BEEN PROCURED FROM SACCARA I HAVE BEEN FAVOURED WITH THE PERMISSION TO UNROLL ANOTHER MUMMY OF THE IBIS ALSO SENT FROM THEBES BY MAJOR HLAYES WHICH HAD BEEN EMBALMED IN A DIFFERENT MANNER FROM THAT I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED THE CLOTH WHICH SURROUNDED IT WAS OF A COARSER TEXTURE AND HAD NOT BEEN SO THOROUGHLY IMBUED WITH BITUMEN NOR WAS THE ROLLER CONTINUED DOWN TO THE BODY OF THE BIRD FOR WHEN I HAD REMOVED AS MUCH OF THE BANDAGE AS REDUCED THE MUMMY TO ABOUT  OF ITS ORIGINAL BULK I FOUND THAT INSTEAD OF CIRCULAR BANDS IT WAS WRAPPED INR SEVERAL DIFFERENT PORTIONS OF COARSE LINEN CLOTH EACH OF THEM LARGE ENOUGH TO CONTAIN THE WHOLE IBIS THIS IBIS WAS IN A DECAYED STATE AND HAD SO LITTLE COHERENCE THAT ITS SEVERAL PARTS SEPARATED ON HANDLING IT THERE WAS A SMALL PORTION OF THE NECK WITH WHITE PLUMAGE UPON IT REMAINING BUT NEITHER THE HEAD THE HILL NOR ANY REMAINS OF THEM COULD BE DISCOVERED THE FEATHERS OF THIS BIRD ARE OF A DARK BROWN COLOUR IN SOME PARTS TIPPED WITH WHITE THE NECK AND THE TAIL HAVE A WHITE PLUMAGE AND AS MUCH OF THE TAIL AS COULD BE PRESERVED DIS PLAYED THE TUFTED APPEARANCE DELINEATED IN THE ENGRAVING OF M CUVIER TWO SPECIES OF THE IBIS THE BLACK AND THE WHITE HAVE BEEN NOTICED BY HERODOTUS ARISTOTLE AND PLINY BUT PLU TARCII HAS ONLY MENTIONED THE WHITE IBIS  ARISTOTLE AND PLINY HAVE CONTENDED THAT THE BLACK IBIS WAS FOUND ONLY AT DAMIETTA PELUSIUM AND THAT IN ALL THE OTHER PARTS OF EGYPT THE WHITE IBIS ONLY WAS SEEN WHETHER THE TWO BIRDS WHICH I  EUTERPE T HIST ANIRMALIUM LIB IX C XXVIIO  C PLINXI NAT HISS IB X C XXX  DE

IS OF A DARK COLOUR BUT THE PLUMAGE BENEATH IS WHITE MANY OF THE DARK FEATHERS ARE NOT AT ALL MARKED WITH WHITE THE MOST ANCIENT AND PROBABLY THE MOSTAUTHENTIC ACCOUNT WHICH WO E POSSESS OF THE EGYPTIAN ART OF EMBALMING IS DELI VERED BY HERODOTTTS  AND WHAT IS OFFERED UPON THIS SUBJECT BY SUBSEQUENT WRITERS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN COPIED FROM THIS EARLY HISTORIAN THEIR NARRATIVES RELATE PRINCIPALLY TO THE CON SERVATION OF HUMAN BODIES AND IN THE PREPARING OF THESE IT APPEARS THAT THE CONTENTS OF THE ABDOMEN AT LEAST WERE RE MOVED BY INCISION OR WERE CORRODIED BY INJECTING A LIQUOR EXTRACTED FROM THE CEDARTREET BUT IT IS ALMOST CERTAIN THAT BIRDS WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY OPENED NOR WAS ANY ART EMPLOYED TO REMOVE THE STOMACH AND INTESTINES FOR ON EXAMINING THE INTERIOR PARTS OF THE DARK COLOURED IBIS I MET WITH A SOFT SPONGY SUBSTANCE LYING QUITE LOOSE CONTAINING A GREATNUMBER OF SCARABAI IN AN IMPERFECT STATE THESE HAD PROBABLY BEEN TAKEN AS THE FOOD OF THE BIRD AND WERE NOT DIGESTED AT THE TIME OF ITS DEATH BUT REMAINED IN THE ALIMENTAR CANAL TO THE PRESENT PERIOD CUVIER ALSO REMARKS THAT HE FOUND WITHIN THE MUMMY OF A IBIS PART OF THE SKIN AND SCALES OF A SERPENT AS LARVAE OF DERMESTIDES AND OTHER INSECTS HAVE BEEN DETECTED AMONG THE DUST AND BONES OF A MUMMY IT MAY BE PRESUMED THAT THE IBIS WAS NOT ALWAYS EMBALMED IN A FRESH STATE WHICH MAY INDEED ACCOUNT IN PART FOR THE VERY IMPERFECT CONDITION IN WHICH MANY OF THESE BIRDS ARE FOUND THE IBIS WAS HELD IN GREAT VENERATION BY THE EGYPTIANS FOR  BUTERP F PANCIROLLUS RERUM MEMORAB PARS I TIT XLIIBO   I1 XAT

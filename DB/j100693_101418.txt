the same Gentleman who predicted that of the former Monsieur Auzout the same Person that not long since com municated to the World his Ephemerides touching the course of the former Comet and recommended several Copies of them to the Royal Society to compare their Observations with his Ac count and thereby either to verifie his Predictions or to shew wherein they differ hath lately sent another Ephemerides con cerning the Motion of the Second Comet to the same endthat invited him to send the other In37 In that Tract he observes first in General that this second Comet is contrary to the precedent almost in all particulas se ing that the former moved very swift this pretty slow that a gainst the Order of the signs from East to West this following them from West to East that from South to North this from North to South as far as it hath been hitherto that we hear off observed that on the side opposite to the Sun this on the same side that having been in its Perigec at the time of its Op position this having been there out of the time of its Con junction where he taketh also notice that this Comet differs in brightness from the other as well in its Body which is far more vivid and distinct as in its Train whose splendor is much great er since it may be seen even with great Telescopes which were useless in the former by reason of its dimness After this he descends to particulars and informs us that he began to ob serve this Comet April the second and continued for some days following and that as soon as he had made three or four Ob servations he resolved to try again an Ephemerides but that having no instruments exact enough and the Comet being in a place destitute of Stars and subject to Refractions he feared to venture too much upon Observations so neer one another since in such matters a perfect exactness is necessary and wish ed to see some precedent Observations to direct him which having obtained he thereby verified what he had begun and resolved to carry on his intended Ephemerides especially being urged by his Friends and engaged by his former undertaking that so it might not be thought a meer hazard that made him hit in the former as also that he might try whether his Me thod would succeed as well in slower as in swifter Comets and in those that are neer the Sun as in such as are opposite there unto to the end that men might be advertised of the determi nation of its use if it could not serve but in certain particular Cases He relateth therefore that he had finishd this New Epheme rides April the sixth and put it presently to the Press in doing of which he hopes he hath not disobliged the Publick seeing that though we should loose the sight of this Star within a few days by reason of its approach to the Sun yet having found that38 that it is always to rise before the Sun and that we may again see it better when it shall rise betimes towards the end of May and in the beginning of June if the cleerness of the Daybreak hinder us not he thought it worth the while to try whether the truth of this Ephemeride s could be proved He affirms then that the Line described by this Star resem bles hitherto a Great Circle as it is found in all other Comets in the midst of their Course He finds the said Circle inclined to the Eclipt que about 26 d 30 and the Nodes where it cuts itto wards the beginning of Gemini and Sagittary that it declines from the Equator about 26 d and cuts it towards the 11 d and consequently that its greatest Latitude hath been towards Pisces where it must have been March 24 and its greatest De clination towards the 25 d of the Equator where it was to have been April 11 He puts it in its Perigee March 27 about three of the Clock in the Afternoon when it was about the 15 degrees of Pisces a little more Westerly then Marchab or the Wing of Pegasus and that it was to be in Conjunction with the Sun April 9 Where yet he noteth that according to another Calculation the Perigee was March 27 more towards Night so that the Comet advan ces a little more towards the Eastand retards towards the West which not being very sensible in the first days differs more a bout the end and in the beginning which he leaves to Obser vation He calculateth that the greatest Motion it could make in one day hath been 4 d and 8 or 9 in one hour about 10 and 25 so that its Diurnal Motion is to its lest distance from the Earth a little more than as 1 to 14 and its Hourly Motion as 1 to 330 He wonders that it hath not been seen sooner the first Ob servations that he hath seen but made by others being of March 17 Whereas he finds that it might have been seen since January at least in the Months of February and March when it rose at 2 of the Clock and before because it is very likelythat considering its bigness and brightness when it was towards its Perigee it was visible since that towards the end of February it was not three times as much remote from the Earth than when it was in its Perigee and that towards the end of January it was not five times as much In39 In the interim saith he the other Comet could be seen with the naked eye until January 31 when it was more than ten times further remote than in its Perigee although it was not by far so bright nor its streamer shining as this hath appeared He wishes that all the changes that shall fall out in this Comet might be exactly observdbecause of its not being swift and the Motion of the Earth very sensible unless the Comet be extream ly remote we should find much more light from this than the former Star about the Grand Question whether the Earth moves or not this Author having all along entertained himself with the hopes that the Motion of Comets would evince whe ther the Earth did move or not and this very Comet seemed to him to have by design appeared for that end if it had had more Latitude and that consequently we might have seen it before Daybreak He wishes also that if possible it may be accu rately observed whether it will not a little decline from its great Circle towards the South Judging that some important truth may be thence deduced as well as if its motion retarded more than the place of its Perigee which will be more exactly known when all the passed Observations shall have been obtained and its greatest Motion doe require He fears only that it being then to rise at Break of Day ex act Observations cannot be made of it but he would at least have it sought with Telescopes his Ephemerides directing where about it is to be April 10 it was to be over against the point of the Triangle and from thence more Southerly by more than two degrees and April 11 over against the bright Star of Aries April 17 over against the Stars of the Fly a little more Southerly and May 4 it is to be over against the Pleiades and about the fourth or fifth of the same Month it is to be once more in Conjunction with the Sun after which time the Sun will move from it Eastward and leave it towards the West which will enable us to see it again at a better hour provided the cleerness of the Daybreak be no impediment to us He addeth that this Star must have been the third time in Conjunction with the Sun about the time when it first began to appear and foresees that from all these par ticulars many considerable consequences may be deduced It40 It will cut the Ecliptick about the end of July new Style a lit tle more Eastwards than the Eye of Taurus at which time there will be no seeing of it except it be with a Telescope It will be towards the End of April new style twice as far distant as it was in its Perigee thrice as far May the fourthfour times May the eighteenth and five times June the first c He would not have Men surprised that there have been two Comets within so short a time seeing saith be there were four at least three in the Year 1618 and in other Years there have been two and more at the same time What he adds about their signification we leave to Astrologers to dispute it with him He concludeth with asking pardon if he have committed mis takes which he hopeth he shall obtain the sooner because of the small time he hath had for these calculations and he wishes that he could have made all the Observations himselfseeing that it is easie to fail when one must trust to the Observations of o thers where of we know not the exactness where he instan ceth that according to his Observations the way of the Co met should go neerer the Ecliptick than he hath marked it even without having any great regard to the Refractions but since he would subject himself to others he hath made it pass a little higher which he saith was almost insensibly so in those few days that he was observing and writing but that this may per haps become sensible hereafter which if it be sohe affirms that it will cut the Ecliptick and Equator sooner than he hath mar ked it c However he thinks it convenient to have given a forehand a common Notion of what will become of a Comet to prepare men for all the Changes that may fall out concerning it which he affirms he hath endeavoured to do the rest being easie to correct as soon as any good Observations somewhat distant have been obtained considering that there need but two very exact ones a little distant when the Star is not swift to trace its Way although there must be at least three to find out all the rest But then would he have it considered that al though his Method should be very exact if there be not at hand Instruments big enough and Globes good enough to trust to nothing can be done perfectly in these kind of Predictions A Relation

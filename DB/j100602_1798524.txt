iatelBetha on the Tigris and Tel Ibrahim l 61 the autumll of 1862 Several things occllrred to prevent tlie completion of the sheet till the autumn of 1865 In the first place the Montafik rebellion rendered the country ullsafe for a time As soon as this aSair was settled my services were required by the Political Agent in connexion with the telegraph then being erected between Baghdad and iBusreh NVhen I was again able to go on with the survey Commander Selby had retired and I hacl succeeded him as surveyor in Mesopotamia In attempting to give a brief description of the country con tained in this sheet I purpose following down as far as possible the course of the old navigable canals which call still be tracecl I shall confilae myself almost entirely to a description of the ancient strearns canals and ruins for the present appearance of the country oSers a sad contrast to the lIesopotamia of GUreek and Roman authors or even to the Jezireh of the time of the Abbasside Khalifs of Baghdad Little need be saicl of the felv modern canals and scant cultivation of the present clay In the northeast corner of this sheet and less than a mile and a half from the Tigris is the bed of an old stream now callefl Es Sook or the Bazaar It runs down towards Baghdad the environs of which city it formerly supplied with water It appears to have been regularlv built as ruins lun along botll banks till within a mile and a half of the town or suburb of Baghdad called Kathernain It is supposed by Chesney to be identical witll the Ishaki canal dug according to Abul Feday in the tirrle of the Khalif Muta Wakkel AD 850 by Ishak Ib Ibrahim  Expedition to the Euphrates and Tigris vol i p 27 Its present name of Es Sook or the Bazaar is give to it by the Arabs from its bearing in places where it has beell deepened some fanciful resemblance to a bazaar This name is not an uncommon one apparently for old canals there being two so called close to Baghdad I may here remark that as a rule the canals which appear to have been navigable have low banks but slightly raised aboTe the surrouncling level They generally wind considerably andX have ruins on their banks often lining them for miles In some places near large ruins they appear to have regularly built sides From these streams irrigants were given oS and led over the country in every direction possible These have  fie quently lligh banks of flom 20 to 30 feet and in some instances even higher This is accounted for frozn the fact that the running streams were kept clear by the rush of water through them whereas the derivations from them were only used during the spring or early summer when the rivers are high These had to be cleared out yearly of the deposit left by the muddy waters This was heaped up on tlle sides till they had reached such a VOL XNVII X162 BEWSHER on P t of Mesopotamia conSined between height that it became less laborious to dig a new canal than to travel up the steep sides ot the old one with the mud dug Ollt of the bottom Thtls five or si canals with fornlidable high banks mas be seen rtlnning side by side for miles the parent stream being so irldistinct that at times it is difficult to trace it This system of deepening and diggillg new canals is carried on at the present day The supposed navigable canals or constant streams are marliecl orv the map with two open lilles the supposed unused irrigants with black lines The ruins on the banks of the Sook are so con siderable that several have supposed the site of Sittaki to be here Though the swamp froTn the Saklawiyeh callal has dolle its best to obliterate these ruins yet the country around is still covered with bricks and debris of buildings to sueh an estent that there are at first sight good grounds for this supposition There ale two hollows along the line of the Sook which htave apparelltly beell made by the rush of water bom the SaklanJiveh marsh They are llalf a mile apart The southern one is called Ain or AineX Hadawiyeh and the northern Ain Serakha Ain is the Alabic for a spring of water The Serakha pond is about 180 yards in diameter and so deep that watel remains in it all through the hot season On the eastern bank there is aw ruill comletely below the level of the ground It is composed of bricks elllbedded ill bitumen These are 13 inches squa1le and 22 to 4 illches thick tlley are cut out of the litumen in vl1ieh they are embedded and carried to Baghdad for sale The town o Wathemain is clustered round and derives its name from the tomb of two Itnams buried there These are Imam Musa

the Bombay Government Records No XLIII It will be sufEcient to note here that Baghdad was built in the year 145 of the IIegira AD 762 by Munsoor the second Khalif The accounts given by the Arab historians are both interest ing and amusing Many of these stories concerning the building of the town and the exents that occurred during the reigns of the Abasside Khalifs have found their way into  Crichtons Arabia7 and other worles In AH 656 Mustassem Billah the last Khalif was put to death by IIulaka ilihan when he captured the city Most of the public buildings were then destroyed and it is probably due in a great measure to this prince that Baghdad of the present day shows but few traces of its former rnagnificence After being taken and retaken by the Turks and Persians Baglldad was finally conquerecI by Sultan Murad IV in AD 1638  Since that period to quote richton  the once illustrious city of the Abbassides has been degraded to the seat of a Turkish Pashalic Amollg the few retnaining ruins that markthe Abbasside dynasty in Baghdad may be seen the Medresseh or College built by Mustanser in the year 630 of the Hegira AD 1232 The inscription on it is being now restored One of the oldest buildings in the town is the lninaret tof a nosque called Jatna es Sook el Ghuzl after the thread market near which it is Commander Jones determined the position of this minaret whicll he gives in his map of Bahdad as in lat 33 20 N long 44 25 E Close to the westward of Baghdad are several deep openings of the Saklaviyeh canal or sore properly speaking of the marsh formed by the Saklawiyeh Through one of these Masaoodi Captain Lynch brought the Ez6phrtes steamer in 1838 The Saklawiyeh is llOW closed both on the Euphrates and Tigris The large and conspicuous ruin now called Akr Kuf is 102 iles a little north of west from the bridge of boats at Bagh clad This ruin is conlposed of sundried bricks 14 inches square and nearly 4 inches thick Between the layers of bricks is one of reeds or mats and between every seventh and eighth an estra thickness of these reeds can be noticed This mass of sundlied bricls is solid to all appearance is nearly square in shape and stands on a ruin of apparently kilnburnt bricks and lime It is surrounded by extensive ruins which have been partially opelled by Mr Loftus A canal appears to have passed close to the eastward of Akr Suf but as I have traced it till it was lost in the Saklawiyel 264 BEWSHER on Part of Mesopotamia contained betweewz swamp I am unable to say from which river it came Akr Kuf is spoken of by Chesney and also in Rawlinsons  Ancient Monarchies as being on the Saklawiyeh It is supposed by General Rawlinson to be the ruin of a Parthian town occupying the site of an earlier Chaldean city Note to p 27 vol i 4 An cietlt Mlionarchies It is marked in Chesneys map as the ruin of Accad of the Bible aild in WIr Pawlinsons work as tlle site of Duraba Its summit is now 126 feet above the level of the raised glound near it and the shapeless mass can be dis tinctly seen from both rivers Yakuti speaking of Akr Ruf says it was supposed in his time about H 613 to have been the burial place of Sassanlan kings The Abu Ghurraib is a modern canal now in use emanating fronz the Euphrates at a point 34 uliles west of Baghdad and about 68 miles direct from Hillah This canal appears to haxe been cut in the bed of the Nahr Aeesa an old canal of the time of Munsoor the founder of Baghdad The Saklaviyeh canal which leaves the Euphrates about 6 miles above the Abu Ghurraib is supposed by Shesney Expedition to the Euphrates and Tigris vol i pp 32 and 55 and others quoting him to correspond with the Wahr Aeesa My reasons for thinking that the Abu Ghurraib and the Nahr Aeesa correspond are as fbllows Tllere is a ruin of a tomb now in existence on the Abu Ghurraib canal which is described in the  AIajm el Buldan of Yakuti as being on the Nahr Aeesa Besides tllis evidence there is that of the Zoaba Arabs the present culti vators of the Abu Ghurraib district who frequently told me that their canal was cut in the bed of an older stream callecl the Aeesawi Chesney considers the Abu Ghurraib to coincide with the Nahr Serser of Abul Feda AIap No 7 of the Series and vol i p 55 of his work vet ill the next page he says the Abu Ghurraib corresponds with the El Melik a canal to the southward which I will presently describe also at p 281 vol i where he says the ruins of iliush are on the Nahr tialka these ruins he has previously identified with Sindiyeh and placed them on the Abu Ghurraib or Wahr Serser There is great confusion in the letterpress as to these canals but in the map they are very distinct and the Abu Ghurraib is luarked as the supposed Wahr Serser of Abul Feda Either of the two canals now called Abu Sumak and Sewadiyeh might correspont with Abul Fedas Serser These may have been cut in the bed of older streams but they had not sufficiently the characteristies of navigable canals to warrant llly rnarking them as such The old name of Serser as applied to a canal seerrls quite unknown to the present Arabs Abul Feda says the Serser left the Euphrates below theSEteriatelBeytha on the Tigris and Tel Ibrahim 165 teesa till it comes to Serser which is describecl by Edrisi as a flourishing commercial town 9 lniles from Baghdad on a navigable canal on which there is a bridge of boats After watering all these countries he says it joins the rligris between Baghdad and Modain  Expedition to the Euphrates and Tigris vol i p 56 Yakuti in the Majm el Buldan says  Serser  two villages within the limits of Bathdad the great Serser and tlle little on the Nahr Aeesa and somettes callect the Xahr sSerse and the distance between the little Serser ancl Baghdad is two fersakhs and it is on the road to the IIaj flom Baghdad and was called in former days Serser Ed Ieir Where two such good authorities as Abul Feda and Yakuti disagree it is difficult to form an opinionv but it seems probable that the Nahr Serser was a branch of the Nahr Aeesa At a place called Alunfuth rneaning a place xvhere water flows the old stream which I have thought was the Nahl Aeesa bifurcates one branch going on to the Tigris a little south of Baghdad and the other taking a lllore southerly direc tion There are ruins in great abundance at this spotin fact in wonderful profusion aold the distallce from Bahdad of 17 niles almost corresponding with that given by Edrisi they might very probably be the ruins of the town of Serser in lYhich case the southern branch canal mitht be the Serser as described by Yakuti Senadiyeh or SinditTeh which I have previously mentionecl is the ruin of a handsomelybuilt mosque or tomb It is on the Abu Ghurraib and is distant 20 miles from Baghdad frozn which it bears about wsw It is falling fast into decay the dome having Mallen in Yakuti mentions this place and says that it took its nalne from a man of Sindlvan wllo was in or overned the district and he seelus to sav for he is not very distinct on the subject that this man died there in AH 503 The tornb is apparently of a later or Abasside tizue The appearallce of the ground in the neighbourhood would show that this as zmost other buildings now standing was erected on others then in ruins This spot was visited accolding to DXAnville by both 13albi and Texeira A rnile and a half to the eastward of Senadiyeh a branch canal leaves the Aeesa going to the northward it is called the Akatum and has every appearance of having been a permanent or naxtigable stream as the rnins on its banks are very considerable 1 have only traced this stream 7 miles from the forlc as my work ends there I may be wrong in saving this stream came fiaom the Aeesa for I had no level and have not ascertained the dip of   Serser rabic for cricket166 BESSHER on Part of Mesopotamia contained between the country This is generally from north to south ancl I may find that this canal took that course There are several very peculiar old beds of streams or canals to the westward of Senadiyeh such as I have only met with ill this part of the country They are 35 to 40 paces broad and run for miles in a perfectly straight line They have no ruins on their banks and in a distarlse of 30 miles have ouly two branch canals emanating from them Had it not been for these two canals I should have taken them for old embankmentsn although they are now ouly a foot or twzro above the level of the ground The Arabs use them in the winter when the grounci is swampy as roacls and call them all  Towaeel whieh is the dimillutive of the word mealling length They have no idea what they were for or when they were used and they are equally a puzzle to lue I have marked them on the map with tvo opell lines as navigable canals Four miles to the westward of Senacliyeh is a mound called uneeseh or Kunaseh This nalne at once attracted our atteil tion from the fact of the battle of Kunaxa having been fought in the neighbourllood and frozn the strange similarity of the two nalYles Kunaseh being the nearest approach that arl Aral could make to Kunasa In a country where names of mouncls are frequently changedexcept indeecl the larger ones it seeirls improbalule atad almost too good to be true that this one particular spot the site of which has leen so lollg soutllt foa should llave kept its nanze intact for nearly 2300 years Chesney ancl Ainswortll who have been over the very ground have not noticed the name of Kuneeseh wllich is the more remalkablen as this mound seerns to corresporld with that callecl Abu Ghurraib ill the map of the expeditioll under Chesney Euneeseh is the Arabic for  church and I believe the Hebres word is very similar I venture to think that the name Sunaxaw given to the leattle on the authority of Plutarch may be a CO1 ruption of the Hebrew word and that the battle was actuallfr fought at this spot There could llOt be a better authority oB this point thall Mr Grote who says  Following therefore the distance given by Plutarch probably copied from Ktesias Xe should place liunaxa a little lower down the river tharl lSelujah this seems the most probable supposition  Grotes IIistory of Greece vol is lwote 2 to p 56 The mouncl of IVuneeseh is 17 miles from Felujah and 51t in a direct line from Babel the northern mound of those marking the supposed site of Babylon This agreess as nearly as may be with the 500 stadia of Plutarch which he gives as the distallce betweell the tnTo places Whether this supposition be correct or llot there is llOtlllllggSheriateZBeytha on the Tigris and Tel IbraAlim 167 I think in Xenophons account of the advance or retreat of the Greeks that would disprove it In following the tracks of the Greeks I will take Pylte as a startingpoint This is learked in Chesneys map as 22 miles from Hit Commander Jones of the Indian Navy a former surveyor in Mesopotamia thinks it should be identified with a place called Bekaa 9 miles to the southeastward of lfit from the fact of the Arabic word Bekaa having about the same meaning as the Greek Pyloe and fronz the fact that there is actually a narrow pass at that place  Bombay Selections No XTTTT p 263 note From Pylee the Greeks in three days marched 12 parasangs then in one day 3 parasangs It was in the middle of this march that they came to the trench supposed to have been cut by Artaxerses and passed it by a narrow passage of 20 feet This description will exactly apply to all irrigating canal in the process of cor struction A passage of about 20 feet broacl is always left to keep out the water of the river while it is beillg dug or till the time for vvatering the land arrives Further on Xenophon says it was llOt the time for watering the crops p 88  Spelmans Xenophon As to the trench extending 12 parasangs to the Median wall this could onlv have been stated on hearsay evi dence Xenophon then mentions the four canals which are in the plain Chesney seems to lay great stress on this passage for in vol ii p 216 he says The Isa the Nahr Serser and other canals were so many successive lines of defence NVhereas these canals were cut more than eleven hundred years after the battle Mr Grote in the map accompanying the 9th volume of his History of Greece has placed these canals to the southward of Kunaxa IIe also notes that ASajol Rennel Ritter Mr Ainsworth and Chesney have wrongly interpreted the words of Xenophon who does not say that Cyrus ever passed the wall of Media or these four canals before the battle of Eunasa  History of Greece vol ix p 88 Xenophon says the water was derivecl from the Tigris and fell into the Euphrates and he repeats this statenlent about the two canals passed after the battle This seems to be a tnistake as all the canals in this part of the country would from its dip be necessarily cut from the Euphrates to the Tigris To COll tinue in the botsteps of the Greeks Thev hacl alreacly marchecl from Pylee 15 parasangs and if 7 parasangs are allored for the next two marches it will give 22 parasangs from Pyloe to tlle fielcl of battle Bekaa is distant from the mound of Kuneeseh 59 lniles in as straight a line as it is possible to go This divided by 22 would give nearly 2 miles to the parasang which is about correct It is worth noticing that the pebbly ridge close to IVuneesell would exactly answer to the descrip168 BEWSHER on Part of MesopotGlania contained between tion of the hill lnenfoned key Xenophons on which Artaserxes cavalrxr made a stand after retreating fiom the

Abdulla a mound a little to the southward saw mounds on the opposite bank leading to Deir evidently the continuation of the canal The other canals I did not quite follow to the banles high brushwood intervening but they all centered in the same spot and the people there informed me that they all reappeared on the opposite bank  Extract of a letter to Colonel Kelnball CB Political Besident Baghdad The mounds of Deir are situated according to Lieutenant Collingwoods map at a distance of 67000 yards from Babel and 66000 vards from the mouth of the Diyala River near which spot Mr Sawlinson places Opis and to which I shall allude further on The Greeks after three days march passed the wall of AIedia The position of this wall has been much discussed 3from the discoveries of Captain Lyncll and lAr Ross it was supposed that the ruins of the Median wall could be traced stretchint across from the Tigris at latitede 34 3 x in a southsouthwesterly direction to the Euphrates Commander Jones who exatnined the spot in 1850 says of it neither in its construction or extent will it in any way answer the descrip tion of the arlciellt writers Bombay Government Records No XTjTTT p 263 tir Grote qlloting this says From this important communication it results that there is as yet no evidence now remaining for determining what was the line or position of the wall of DIedia which had been supposed to be a datum positively established servirlg as premises froln whence to deduce other positions lnentioned by Xenophon vol is note p 88 A lille drawn from Tel Kuneeseh to the ruins of Oeir would esactly touch the ruin of a wall now called Hubl esSukhr or line of stones or bricks The ruins of this wall anay be now traced for alDout 2 milesv and are about 6 feet above the level of the

north wald has done lnuch towalds reducing this wall The to caravanserais at lihanezzad are also in a gleat measure built of bricks froln it and it has doubtless supplied materials for many other buildillgs There is a considerable quantity of bitumen scattered about and it was probably macle of bricks set ill bituluen I can see nothing in Xenophon which would show that this is not the wall the Greeks passed for what he says of its length was merely what was told hm I think that this mtlst be the ruin of the wall called that of Atedia which Xenophon descrites but I lnention this supposition with much difZidence and for the benefit ot those better able than myself170 BEWSHER on Pare of Mesopotamia contained between to judge of its being correct The distallce fiom the nortllerll point of tllis wall as now seen from the encampment might be allowing for a ddtour abollt 32 miles Whether this was done in three or four days marching has been disputed lout I do not think that this is of much importance either way  From thence they made in two days ularch 8 parasangs and passed two canals one upon a bridge and the other upon seven pontoons These two canals might have been the Nahr Malka and the old canal the beci of which is now called Hubl edDthehheb This latter was either a continuation of the Nahr Malka oll a streatn from the Tigris Allowing the 8 parasangs to be 24 miles and that the Greeks clossed the seconci canal at the end of these marches the woulcl have dolle so at a point nearly 12 miles south of Ctesiphon and nearly 15 miles from Deir which I have alreadr said seems to mark Mr Rawlinsons Sittaki XenopElon aftei stating that they crossed these canals says  thence they came to the river Tigris near which stood a large and populous cita called Sitace at the distance of 15 stadia 12 lnile kom the river Spelmans Xenophon p 94 It seems to me that another days march could be allowed from the eanal crossed by a pontoon bridge The island on which Xenophon says Sitace stood would have been formed by the Tigris on olle side the old streaul now called Hubledlthehheb Oll the other and perhaps two branch canals After crossing the Tigris the Greeks luarched 20 parasangs in four days to the river Physcus on which stood the large town called Opis The position of this spot has llOt been determined as yet Mrs Rawlinson in his map accompanying vol i of Jais Ancient Monarchies puts it on the OiyaleX which he supposes was the Physcus and about 3 luiles from the Tigris Cheslley has placed it 57 miles to the northward of Baghdad close to olle of the heads of

the Romans were compelled to retire In AD 363 Julian after capturing Perisabor and Moaga Malka also tried to take Ctesiphon but failed Perisabor was a corruption of Ferooz Sabool a city which was also

it and debris of buildings eover the soil for miles I have no idea what the meaning of the word is I have not I am sorry to say a eopy of Ammianus Mareellinus but I see that Gibbon says after the

is now the ouly Parthian or Sassaniall ruin in this part o the world not converted by time and decay into a heap of rubknish It was Sually conquered by the Mahomedans soon after the death of thc Prophet Of the two cities of Seleucia and tesiphon or el Modian there are not as many ruins as might be expected to mark their sites Of the former Tel Omer and Sirhann two mounds of no great size The former was opened by Mr Taylor now Eer Majestys Consul at Erze room and Diarbekr There are also the remains of a wall which atut on the river where it is upwards of 30 feet high This was built of sundried bricks and appears to have sur rounded the mound of Silhan It corltinues ill the same direc tion on the eastern bank of the Tigris and if we did not know that the rivers separated the two cities as it now does their ruins one would be apt to think that it formerly ldowed to the orthward of the latter city There is a swamp zaeal Tel Omer which has cloubtless swallowed up nlany of the ruins of Seleucia as low mounds and ridges of bricks and lime can be traced all over it Round about Tak Kesra are some low ruins of buildings and a few small mounds A canal seems to have passed close to the westward of the palace and was probably flom the Nahrwan To the svestward of the palace are the ruins of a wall similar to that on the opposite side This forms an arc of a circle both ends abutting on the river with ruins of buildillgs enclosed A nwile and a half to the eastsouth eastward is another wall callecl by the Arabs SoorelBostan or garderl wall It fortns a right angle with both

bight are the traces of a canal or navigable strealll which I have previously mentioned called HubledDthehheb There are marks in the Ctesiphon bight wllich would show that in former years the bottom of the bight was to the northward of a line drawn across connecting the two streams I cannot help thinking that the BubledDthehheb was a continuation of the Nahr Malka I am aware that almost a11 the ancient autho rities Pliny Ammianus and Polybius agree in stating that the Wahr Malka fell into the Tigris at Seleucia but PtolemvS I believe says it fE11 illtO that river some distance below Seleucia It would certainly have been of enormous advantage to the country to the southward of Seleucia if lhe waters of the Euphrates brought down by the Nahr 3Ialka had been con veyed over it It is true that this might have been done by irrigallts still leaving water enough to form a navigable canal flowing into the Tigris at Seleucia lhat the Nahr Malka and IIubledDthehheb appear to have been one stream a glance at the map will show Aloul Feda says the el Melek was the next canal to the southward of the Serser Yaliuti says it is beyond the Nahr Aeesa and watered 360 villages and that it was dug by Solo mon the son of lavid according to some and by Alexanclel the Great according to others The branch that leaves the Yuseffiyeh at Abu Hubba again bifurcates at a place four O1 five miles to the southeastward called KhushmedDhteeb or the Wolfs Nose There are several smaller canals at this spot radiating in diSerent directions and extensive ruins lie scattered about The stream at this point must have been frequentlv deepened as the callals have very high banks One of the main branches passes close to the ruin called Shaishebar which I have previously mentioned From ShushmedDtheeb the other branch goes to the south turning aftex 11 mile due eastS gradually assuming the appearance of an irrigating canal Close to the sollthward and passing within a few hundred frards of this last stream is the bed of another old navigable one the Arabs call this Abu Dibbis It leaves the river 34 miles above Babel and flows close to the northward of a ridge of pebbly formation It is very indistinct in places the ground having at one time been a swamp Numerous high banked canals seemecl to have joined these two streams taking the water of the northern into the southern one after its OWll rnouth had becomeSheriat elBeythaS on tA2e Tigris and Tel Ibrahim 177 ehoked up or unused This spot is also called Kllushmed Dtheeb and the old canals form a perfect network and cross one another

abrupt endings of the higil banked irrigants it wouldn in places7 be impossible to trace it This stream lnUSt have taken nearly a11 the water of the Euphrates left by the Nahr Atallva if it was llot that river itself Froll1 the paucity of 1uins on the Euphrates to the southwarcl of the Abu Dibbis and f1oul the immense nunlber on this stream it would appear that the old Eu hrates flowed to the

flows A ea1lal might have been cut through this ap which graclually enlarged till it took the xvhole of the river What would seeln to lnake this probable iS the fact that the old strealn which flowed

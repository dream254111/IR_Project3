J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1074711,THE STUDY OF ENGLISH IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS,I244454,THE STUDY OF ENGLISH IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS A REPORT HAS RECENTLY BEEN MADE TO THE OVERSEERS OF HARVARD COLLEGE BY THE COMMITTEE ON COMPOSITION AND RHETORIC THIS REPORT SHOWS THE VERY FAULTY USE OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE BY A CLASS OF STUDENTS IN THAT ANCIENT AND HONORABLE UNIVERSITY IN THE REPORT A LARGE NUMBER OF THE PRODUCTIONS OF THOSE STU DENTS ARE PRINTED IN FACSIMILE REDUCED TO ONEHALF THEIR ORIGINAL SIZE BEYOND A DOUBT THOSE STUDENTS HAD NO COMMAND OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE THOUGH THEY HAD PASSED THE HARVARD EXAMI NATIONS AND ENTERED THE INSTITUTION THIS IS CONCLUSIVE PROOF THAT THE STANDARD OF ADMISSION TO HARVARD WAS LOW THE REPORT DEPLORES THE FACT THAT THE PROFESSORS ARE OBLIGED TO SUPPLEMENT THE DEFECTIVE PREPARATION OF STUDENTS IN ENGLISH BEFORE GOING ON TO THE MORE ADVANCED WORK APPROPRIATE TO THEM AND IT SEEMS TO LAY THE FAULT AT THE DOOR OF THE PREPARATORY SCHOOLS BUT THE PREPARATORY SCHOOLS HAD MET THE REQUIREMENTS THEIR STUDENTS HAD PASSED THE ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS THESE SCHOOLS MIGHT WITH EQUAL PROPRIETY COMPLAIN THAT THE PUPILS WHO COME TO THEM ARE NOT WELL FITTED FOR THE WORK APPROPRIATE TO THESE FITTING SCHOOLS AND THE LOWER SCHOOLS MAY LIKEWISE INSIST UPON A BETTER TRAINING IN ENGLISH IN THE PRIMARY SCHOOLS AND SO ON TO THE KIN DERGARTEN THE HOME AND EVEN TO  HEREDITARY TENDENCY AND EN VIRONMENT  AGAIN EVEN THE GRADUATES OF HARVARD AND OTHER COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES DO NOT ALL WRITE GOOD ENGLISH TO QUOTE FROM ONE OF THEM  PROFESSOR PICKERING OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY MAKES A STRONG POINT IN HIS ENDEAVOR TO SECURE FUNDS TO PROPERLY EQUIP THE HARVARD OBSERVATORY IN PERU BY THE STATEMENT THAT OWING TO THE UNSTEADY CHARACTER OF THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN EUROPE TELESCOPES OF HIGH MAGNIFYING POWER CAN NOT BE USED SO THAT EVEN THE GREAT LICK TELESCOPE OF 36 INCHES APERTURE IS ABLE TO DO NO BETTER WORK THAN PROFESSOR PICKERING HAS BEEN ABLE TO DO IN PERU WITH A LITTLE I3INCH INSTRUMENT A STATEMENT THAT WOULD BE READILY ACCEPTED BY THOSE WHO HAVE WATCHED IN VAIN FOR THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF ASTRONOMICAL DISCOVERIES FROM THE LICK OBSERVA TORY  ANOTHER IT IS CERTAINLY MOST UNFORTUNATE LOOKED AT FROM A STANDPOINT ENTIRELY OUTSIDE OF REPUBLICAN PARTISANSHIP THAT IF MR CLEVELAND WAS TO BE ELECTED IT COULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED THATTHE STUDY OF ENGLISH IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SUCH A RESULT OF THE VOTING AS WOULD HAVE THROWN THE ELECTION INTO CONGRESS IN WHICH CASE THOUGH THE EX PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE BEEN AGAIN PLACED IN THE PRESIDENTIAL CHAIR THE COUNLTRY WOULD HAVE BEEN SPARED THE PLACING OF SUCH A MAN AS MR ADLAI E STEVENSON IN DIRECT LINE OF SUCCESSION TO THE PRES IDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES NO ONE WOULD FOR ONE MOMENT SUPPOSE THAT THESE OVERLOADED SENTENCES ARE THE RESULT OF THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION AT HARVARD NEITHER IS THE DEFECT IN THE TRAINING OF STUDENTS WHO ENTER THAT IN STITUTION NECESSARILY OR PROBABLY DUE TO POOR TEACHING IN THE PREPARATORY SCHOOLS THESE DEFECTS MAY BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO A VARIETY OF CAUSES AND AMONG THESE CAUSES IS ONE WHICH IS SUG GESTED AT THE CLOSE OF THE FOLLOWING QUOTATION FROM A COLLEGE GRAD UATE EDUCATION DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A PANACEA FOR TEMPORAL DISTRESS IN THAT LAND OF THE HIGHLY EDUCATED GERMANY FOR ONE OF TLHE GERMAN OFFICIALS DECLARES THAT THERE ARE LAWYERS PHYSICIANS AND DOCTORS OF PHILOSOPHY AMONG THOSE WHO ARE REGULARLY RE LIEVED BY THE POOR BOARD BUT IT IS MANIFESTLY UNFAIR TO LAY THIS CONDITION OF THINGS IN GERMANY TO THE DISCREDIT OF EDUCATION WHICH CAN NOT BA EXPECTED TO MAKE SUCCESSFUL LAWYERS MINISTERS OR DOCTORS OUT OF DOLTS LET IT BE NOTED THAT THE IMPERFECT PRODUCT OF THE SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES IS NOT ALWAYS DUE TO FAULTS IN THE SCHOOLS BUT WITHOUT BANDYING THE BLAME FROM THE EDITOR TO THE COLLEGE WHEN HE FINDS THAT THE STUDENT FRESH FROM COLLEGE CAN NOT WRITE GOOD ENGLISH FROM THE COLLEGE TO THE FITTING SCHOOL FROM THE FITTING SCHOOL TO THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL AND SO ON TO THE PRIMARY SCHOOL AND THE KINDERGARTEN LET US ADMIT THAT THE STUDY OF ENGLISH HAS BEEN DE FECTIVE AND LET US SEEK A REMEDY IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF FRANCE THE STUDY OF THE FRENCH LAN GUAGE AND LITERATURE OCCUPIES ONEFIFTH OF THE TIME IF THE EN GLISH LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE WERE TO OCCUPY AS LARGE A PROPOR TION OF THE TIME IN OUR SCHOOL CURRICULUM THE EDUCATION OF OUR CHILDREN WOULD BE GREATLY IMPROVED FOR THERE IS NO STUDY IN THE WHOLE COURSE WHICH MAY BE MADE A BETTER INSTRUMENT OF CULTURE THAN THE STUDY OF ENGLISH IT CONCERNS ITSELF WITH CLOSE AND ACCURATE THINKING AND THIS KIND OF THINKING IS THE VERY END AND AIM OF EDUCATION I THE STUDY OF ENGLISH INCLUDES ORAL SPEECH AND WRITTEN OR PRINTED LANGUAGE THE FIRST OF THESE IS AS IMPORTANT WITH YOUNG 199THE SCHOOL REVIEW PUPILS AS IS THE LAST AND WITH ADVANCED STUDENTS THE CAREFUL STUDY OF THEIR ORAL SPEECH IS OF GREAT VALUE THOUGH IT HAS GEN ERALLY RECEIVED BUT LITTLE ATTENTION IN SOCIETY CONVERSATION IS FREQUENTLY CARRIED ON IN A CARELESS THOUGHTLESS WAY WORDS ARE OFTEN USED WITH VERY LITTLE REGARD TO THEIR MEANING EXPRESSIONS ARE EMPLOYED BECAUSE THEY ARE NOVEL OR STRIKING RATHER THAN BE CAUSE THEY ARE APPROPRIATE AND FITTING AND QUITE GENERALLY A WORD DOES DUTY IN ORAL SPEECH IN A SENSE VERY REMOTE FROM ITS REAL MEANING AWFUL ALMIGHTY SPLENDID ARE WORDS COMMONLY USED TO EXPRESS A MERE SUPERLATIVE THE SAME BAD HABIT OF ORAL SPEAKING IS NOT UNFREQUENTLY ALLOWED IN THE CLASS ROOM THE PUPIL RECITES IN SLOVENLY LANGUAGE HE TRANSLATES A FOREIGN LANGUAGE INTO ENGLISH WHICH IS INAPPROPRIATE UNIDIOMATIC AND INCORRECT HE DEMONSTRATES A PROBLEM IN GEOMETRY IN LAN GUAGE BOTH INELEGANT AND FRAGMENTARY IN HIS RECITATION IN HIS TORY OR GEOGRAPHY THE STATEMENTS ARE BROKEN AND DISJOINTED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO NARRATE A CIRCUMSTANCE OR TO EXPRESS AN OPINION HE IS CARELESS ABOUT THE LANGUAGE EMPLOYED AND IN ALL THESE CASES THE TEACHER IS WATCHING SO CLOSELY FOR THE GLIMMER OF THE THOUGHT THAT HE FAILS TO NOTICE THE LANGUAGE IN WHICH THE THOUGHT IS EX PRESSED THE STUDY OF ENGLISH THEN SHOULD BEGIN WITH ORAL SPEECH AND ESPECIALLY IT SHOULD SO BEGIN THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL IN THE LOWEST GRADE THIS CAREFUL ATTENTION TO ORAL LANGUAGE MUST NOT BE OMITTED AT ANY STAGE OF SCHOOL LIFE ORAL SPEECH PRECEDES WRITTEN LANGUAGE AND IF THE WRITTEN LANGUAGE OF PUPILS IN SCHOOL AT FIRST AND ALL ALONG WERE MADE THE BASIS OF THE WRITTEN WORK THE THEMES AND COMPOSITIONSTHESE EXERCISES WOULD BE ROBBED OF ALL THEIR TERROR THE CHILD BEGINS TO TALK AT A VERY EARLY AGE AND HE KNOWS THE MEANING OF MANY WORDS LONG BEFORE HE CAN PRONOUNCE THEM ON COMING TO SCHOOL HIS VOCABULARY IS MUCH LARGER THAN WE HAVE CREDITED HIM WITH AND HIS POWER OF EXPRESSION IS GREATER THAN MOST TEACHERS SUPPOSE IT HAS BEEN ASSUMED THAT THE VOCABULARY OF A CHILD FOUR OR FIVE YEARS OLD CONTAINS THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED WORDS FEW PEOPLE WOULD PLACE THE NUMBER AS HIGH AS FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED FROM A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS COVERING A LARGE FIELD AND MADE WITH THE PURPOSE OF ASCERTAINLING CERTAIN OTHER FACTS AS WELL AS THE EXTENT OF THE CHILDS VOCABULARY IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT THE ORDINARY CHILD AT THE AGE OF FOUR OR FIVE YEARS HAS THE 200THE STUDY OF ENGLISH IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS COMMAND OF TWELVE HUNDRED WORDS AND MANY CHILDREN AT THE AGE OF FIVE KNOW THE MEANING AND THE USE OF FIFTEEN HUNDRED WORDS NOW THE FIRST AND THE CHIEF DUTY OF THE TEACHER IS TO INDUCE THE CHILD JUST ENTERING SCHOOL TO TALKTO EXPRESS HIMSELF HE KNOWS A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN HE GETS CREDIT FOR THERE IS A PRE SUMPTION OF BRAINS OF THOUGHT AND OF ABILITY TO SPEAK OF COURSE THE LITTLE CHILD IS TIMID AND AMIDST THE UNUSUAL SUR ROUNDINGSTHE ENVIRONMENT TO USE AN EDUCATIONAL TERMHE RETIRES WITHIN HIMSELF IT IS THE DUTY OF THE TEACHER TO SECURE HIS CONFIDENCE AND TO INDUCE HIM TO REVEAL HIS INNER SELF HIS THOUGHT AND TO DELIGHT IN THIS REVELATION I HAVE CALLED THIS THE CHIEF DUTY BECAUSE THE EXPRESSION OF THOUGHT BEGETS THOUGHT IN THE CHILD THE THOUGHT MAY BE STIM ULATED BY OBJECTS TOYS THE KINDERGARTEN GIFTS AND OCCUPATIONS OBJECTS OF NATURE OF EVERY VARIETY STORIES PLAYSANYTHING WHATEVER THAT INTERESTS HIM THE ORAL LANGUAGETHE CHILDS OWN MAY NEXT BE WRITTEN UPON THE BLACKBOARD FOR HIM TO READ AND THE WRITTEN CHARACTERS SHOULD BE TO HIM THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SOUNDS HE HAS MADE IN SPEAKING  I SEE A CAT WRITTEN UPON THE BLACKBOARD MEANS TO THE CHILD I SEE E CT WHEN THE EXPRESSION IS CHANGED TO  I SEE A HAT A MAT HE WILL AT ONCE NOTICE THAT THE C THE H AND THE M EACH MODIFIES THE MEANING IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN THOUGHT NOT TO EXPLAIN AT LENGTH THIS ELEMENTARY PROCESS OF TEACHING READING THE IMPOR TANT FACT IN THIS CONNECTION IS THAT THE CHILD CONNECTS HIS ORAL SPEECH WITH THE WRITTEN LANGUAGE HE IS LED TO SEE THAT WRITTEN LANGUAGE IS THE EXPRESSION OF THOUGHT HIS OWN THOUGHT AND THUS THE READING IS VITALIZED SO TO SPEAK MADE A LIVING THING FROM THIS STAGE IT IS ONLY A STEP FOR HIM TO PERCEIVE THAT WRITTEN LANGUAGE MAY ALSO BE THE EXPRESSION OF ANOTHER PERSONS THOUGHT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT HE SO LOOK UPON IT LATER WHEN HE SEES THE WRITTEN OR PRINTED LANGUAGE IN A BOOK SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH LEARNING TO READ FROM THE BLACKBOARD THE VISIBLE REPRESENTATION OF HIS ORAL SPEECH AND TO TRANSLATE THAT AND OTHER WRITING INTO ORAL LANGUAGE THE CHILD MAY BE OCCUPIED WITH WRITING HIS SPEECH UPON THE SLATE OR ON PAPER WITHOUT THE PRELIMINARY STEP OF UTTERING IT WITH HIS MOUTH AND SEEING IT WRITTEN BY THE TEACHER THE CHILD IS TAUGHT TO THINK TO EXPRESS HIMSELF IN WORDS TO RECOGNIZE THE WRITTEN LANGUAGE AS ANOTHER FORM OF HIS OWN THOUGHT AND TO RE PRODUCE HIS THOUGHT IN VISIBLE FORM AND INCIDENTALLY HE LEARNS 201THE SCHOOL REVIEW THAT ALL WRITTEN OR PRINTED LANGUAGE IS THE EXPRESSION OF THOUGHT HE THUS LEARNS AT THE VERY OUTSET OF HIS SCHOOL EDUCATION TO LOOK BEHIND THE LANGUAGE WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN FOR THE THOUGHT THAT LIES WITHIN THE ABOVE IS NOT INTENDED MERELY TO BE AN ESSAY ON THE FIRST STEPS IN TEACHING READING ITS SIGNIFICANCE IN MY VIEW CONSISTS IN THIS THAT THE PROCESS HERE OUTLINEDTHE THOUGHT ITS ORAL AND VISIBLE EXPRESSION AND THE PERCEPTION OF THE THOUGHT IN PRINTED OR WRITTEN LANGUAGETHAT THIS PROCESS IS THE SAME IN EVERY STAGE OF THE STUDY OF ENGLISH THE PROCESS BEGINS IN THE PRIMARY SCHOOL AND IT NEVER ENDS LANGUAGE IS THE EXPRESSION OF THOUGHT IT IS THIS ONLY IT SHOULD ALWAYS SUGGEST TO THE STUDENT THE THOUGHT WHICH IT EMBODIES AND THE STUDENT SHOULD LOOK BEYOND THE MERE FORM AND PERCEIVE THE IMMATERIAL ESSENCE II THE ORAL EXPRESSION WHOSE VALUE I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO EM PHASIZE AT THE VERY START IN SCHOOL LIFE OUGHT IN MY JUDGMENT TO RECEIVE EQUAL ATTENTION AT EVERY STAGE OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS THE PUPIL OUGHT TO BE ACCUSTOMED TO EXPRESS IN CLEAR CONCISE AND APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE WHATEVER HE HAS SEEN OR THOUGHT OR BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT THIS ORAL EXPRESSION SHOULD BE A DAILY PRACTICE EVERY RECITATION OUGHT TO BE MADE A STUDY OF ENGLISH THE FORM AND THE FITNESS OF THE EXPRESSION SHOULD BE LOOKED UPON AS OF EQUAL IMPORTANCE WITH THE MATTER TO BE EXPRESSED FOR THERE IS NO DEFINITE THOUGHT WITHOUT DEFINITE EXPRESSION VAGUE LAN GUAGE INVOLVES VAGUE THOUGHT AND THIS CAREFUL ATTENTION TO THE LANGUAGE CONSTANT AND UNREMITTING IS A GREAT PART IF NOT THE BEST THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF SCHOOL EDUCATION OF TWO PART NERS IN A BUSINESS FIRM THE OLDER HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY ILL FOR MANY YEARS AT LENGTH THE YOUNGER FAILED IN HEALTH AND FINALLY DIED SOME ONE REMARKED THAT IT WAS FUNNY  THAT THE YOUNGER MAN HAD DIED FIRST IT WAS NOT FUNNY AT ALL IT MAY HAVE BEEN REMARKABLE OR STRANGE BUT IN CRITICISING LANGUAGE IN THIS WAY IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE TO FALL INTO A HABIT OF BEING FINICAL AND OVER NICE LANGUAGE ALSO WHICH MAY BE APPROPRIATE IN ORAL SPEECH MAY NOT BE AS APPROPRIATE WHEN WRITTEN IT REQUIRES MUCH OB SERVATION AND PRACTICE AND A DELICATE SENSE OF FITNESS TO DISCRIM INATE WITH CERTAINTY AND PRECISION BETWEEN WORDS AND EXPRESSIONS THAT ARE COLLOQUIAL AND FORCIBLE AND THOSE WHICH ARE COARSE OR BORDERING ON THE VULGAR A TASTE TOO FASTIDIOUS IN THE USE OF LANGUAGE MAKES THE STYLE STIFF AND STILTED 202THE STUDY OF ENGLISH IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THE SCHOOL REVIEW VOL I NO 2 MR BRAINERD KELLOGG OF THE POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE BROOKLYN GIVES US CERTAIN WORDS AND PHRASES WHICH THE USAGE OF THE BEST WRITERS SAYS WE MAY EMPLOY BUT WHICH PURISTS TELL US WE MAY NOT MUST NOT USE WE MAY USE EACH OTHER OF MORE THAN TWO THINGS AND ONE ANOTHER OF ONLY TWO A WORD OR TWO AS WELL AS ONE OR TWO WORDS HAD RATHEROR HAD BETTER WITH THE PRESENT INFINITIVE ETC THE IMPORTANCE OF CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE SPEECH CONSISTS LESS IN THE WORDS AND EXPRESSIONS WHOSE PROPER USE IS LEARNED THAN IN THE HABIT OF ATTENDING TO THE EXPRESSION IT IS THE STUDY OF BOTH PUPIL AND TEACHER WHICH PRODUCES THE GOOD HABIT OF THOUGHT AND THIS HABIT LEADS NOT ONLY TO CORRECT EXPRESSION BUT TO CORRECT AND ORDERLY THINKING AND THIS IS VASTLY MORE IMPORTANT FROM THIS HABIT OF MUCH TALKING BY THE PUPIL UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF THE TEACHER THE HABIT OF WRITING GROWS NATURALLY HE HAS EX PRESSED HIS THOUGHT IN SPEECH LET HIM TAKE HIS SEAT AND IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS TEACHER AND HIS SCHOOLMATES LET HIM WRITE SIMPLY AND STRAIGHT ON THE SAME WHICH HE HAS SPOKEN WITH NO PARTIC ULAR ATTENTION TO THE WRITING OR THE FORM OF EXPRESSION THAT IS WITH NO MORE ATTENTION THAN HE GAVE TO HIS LANGUAGE WHILE SPEAK ING IN BOTH CASES EQUALLY HIS ATTENTION IS UPON THE THOUGHT AND HE NOTICES THE LANGUAGE ONLY AS IT EXPRESSES HIS THOUGHT AT THE END OF THE PERIODFIFTEEN OR TWENTY MINUTESTHE PAPER MAY BE FOLDED AND LAID UPON THE TEACHERS DESK AT THE NEXT EXERCISE THIS PAPER MAY BE EXAMINED CAREFULLY BY THE PUPIL AND HE WILL THEN SEE HOW NEARLY HE HAS SAID WHAT HE INTENDED TO SAY AND HE MAY CORRECT THE WRITING IN ANY WAY HE CHOOSES SUBSEQUENTLY THE TEACHER MAY EXAMINE AND CORRECT THE PAPER OR THE PUPIL MAY REWRITE IT IT IS MY FIRM BELIEF THAT CHILDREN BROUGHT UP IN THIS WAY WOULD FIND NO MORE DIFFICULTY IN WRITING WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY THAN THEY WOULD HAVE IN SPEAKING IT ORALLY IT WOULD IN FACT BE ABOUT THE SAME THING WE ARE ASSUMING OF COURSE THAT THIS HABIT OF EX PRESSION BOTH ORAL AND WRITTEN HAS BEEN CONTINUOUS THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOLS AND THAT THE TIME FOR EACH EXERCISE AND THE MATTER TALKED AND WRITTEN ABOUT HAVE BEEN ADAPTED TO THE AGE AND CAPACITY OF THE PUPIL III THUS FAR IN THIS DISCUSSION NOT MUCH HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT A MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE IN EXERCISES OF THIS KIND THAT IS THE SOURCE FROM WHICH THE IDEAS TO BE EXPRESSED ARE TO BE DERIVED 203THE SCHOOL REVIEW IN THE PRIMARY SCHOOL THESE IDEAS COME FROM OBJECTS PLAYS STORIES ETC AND IN THE MORE ADVANCED GRADES MANY OF THE IDEAS COME NATURALLY FROM THE OTHER STUDIES OF THE SCHOOLTHE GEOGRA PHY THE HISTORY THE NATURAL SCIENCE ETC AND FROM THE PLACES OF INTEREST THE FACTORIES THE SHOPS AND THE VARIOUS PROCESSES OF MANUFACTURE WHICH THE PUPIL MAY BE INTERESTED IN VISITING AND DESCRIBING BUT THE MAIN RELIANCE FOR THE IDEAS TO BE THOUGHT ABOUT AND WRITTEN ABOUT MUST BE BOOKS ADAPTED TO THE AGE OF THE PUPIL BOOKS OF NATURAL HISTORY FAIRY TALES BOOKS OF TRAVEL BI OGRAPHY AND HISTORY AND THE READING AND THE STUDY OF WELL SE LECTED BOOKS ALL ALONG IN THE COURSE IS ANOTHER MEANS FOR THE STUDY OF ENGLISH THE CAREFUL READING OF BOOKS IN CONNECTION WITH THE SPEAKING AND THE WRITING OUTLINED ABOVE SERVES A TWOFOLD END IN THE FIRST PLACE THE READINGALWAYS WITH THE ATTENTION CHIEFLY UPON THE THOUGHT AS SAID ABOVEFILLS THE MIND WITH SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT AND TO TALK AND WRITE ABOUT AND IN THE SECOND PLACE THE LANGUAGE THE FORM OF EXPRESSION THE STYLE OF THE WRIT ING IMPERCEPTIBLY AND UNCONSCIOUSLY MOULD THE FORM OF SPEECH OF THE PUPIL AND THIS WITHOUT HIS KNOWING IT HE SHOULD NOT ATTEMPT OF COURSE TO REPEAT ORALLY OR TO WRITE IMMEDIATELY AFTER HE HAS FINISHED THE READING SOME TIME SHOULD ELAPSE BETWEEN THE READING AND THE WRITING IN ORDER THAT THE NEW IDEAS MAY AS IT WERE DIGEST IN THE MIND AND BE ASSIMILATED WITH HIS THOUGHT SO AS TO BECOME HIS OWN THE EXACT LANGUAGE WILL NOT BE REMEM BERED AND YET THE NEW IDEA SUGGESTED BY THE READING WILL RE TAIN SOMETHING OF THE FORM OF EXPRESSION IN WHICH IT WAS CLOTHED THE THOUGHT AND THE EXPRESSION ARE SO NEARLY ALLIED AND THIS FORM WILL AFFECT THE WRITTEN LANGUAGE OF THE PUPIL THUS THE READING BOTH EXPANDS THE THOUGHT OF THE PUPIL AND ENLARGES THE POWER OF EXPRESSING THAT THOUGHT THIS HABIT OF READING AND OF REPEATING ORALLY AND IN WRITING THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT HE HAS READ INTRODUCES THE PUPIL TO THE BEST LITERATURE GRADUALLY AND IN STEP WITH HIS GROWING APPRECIA TION AND HIS INCREASING POWER OF EXPRESSION  AND THERE IS NO LIMIT TO THIS POWER OF EXPRESSION SO LONG AS THE MIND MAY EXPAND AND THERE IS THOUGHT TO BE EXPRESSED M FRANGOIS GOUIN IN HIS ADMIRABLE BOOK THE ART OF TEACHING AND STUDYING LANGUAGES SAYS THAT LANGUAGE IS OF TWO KINDS OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE THE OBJECTIVE LANGUAGE BE ING THAT WHICH EXPRESSES THE THOUGHT SUGGESTED BY SOME EXTERNAL 204THE STUDY OF ENGLISH IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OBJECT AND THE SUBJECTIVE LANGUAGE BEING THAT WHICH EXPRESSES WHAT ORIGINATES IN THE MIND ITSELFITS OWN EMOTION OR REFLECTION AS IT WERE  THE WHEEL TURNS AROUND FOR EXAMPLE EXPRESSES A FACT PERCEIVED THROUGH THE SENSES A FACT IN THE EXTERNAL WORLD THAT IS RIGHT ON THE OTHER HAND IS THE EXPRESSION OF A REFLEC TION IN THE MIND ITSELF THIS OBJECTIVE LANGUAGE EXPRESSES A KIND OF THOUGHT WHICH IT APPEARS TO ME A DUMB CREATURE AN IRRATIONAL ANIMAL AS WE SAY MIGHT HAVE THE CHILD SAYS THE WHEEL TURNS ROUND THE TRAINED ANIMAL NOTICES THE MOTION OF HIS MASTERS HAND COM PARES IT WITH FORMER EXPERIENCES AND FORMS A JUDGMENT AND HE ACTS ACCORDINGLY WHY DOES NOT THIS MENTAL PROCESS IN THE INTELLI GENT ANIMAL CORRESPOND WITH THE HUMAN THOUGHT EXPRESSED IN WHAT MR GOUIN CALLS OBJECTIVE LANGUAGE THE THOUGHT EX PRESSED BY THE SUBJECTIVE LANGUAGE IS OF A MORE EXALTED KIND IT IS THE RATIONAL THOUGHT OF A HIGHER ORDER OF INTELLECT IT IS A KIND OF THOUGHT ABOVE AND BEYOND THAT WHICH IS PRODUCED BY MATERIAL OBJECTS OR SENSE PERCEPTIONS AND MANUAL OCCUPATIONS IT IS A KIND OF THOUGHT TO WHICH ALL RIGHT EDUCATION LEADS UP THIS HIGHER KIND OF THOUGHT IS EXPRESSED IN OUR LITERATURE IN THIS LITERATURE ARE EXPRESSED THE FEELINGS THE EMOTIONS PASSIONS POETRY AND THE SENSE OF BEAUTY THE HOPES AND ASPIRATIONS THE FEARS AND THE DESPAIRS OF HUMAN HEARTS ENGLISH IS TO BE STUDIED IN ITS LITER ATURE AND THE STUDY OF THIS LITERATURE IS THE STUDY OF THE RACE AND OF HUMANITY NOW LANGUAGE CANNOT EXPRESS TO ANY ONE VERY MUCH BEYOND THAT WHICH HE HAS LIVED AND EXPERIENCED IN ORDER TO FIND A RESPONSE IN THE MIND THE LANGUAGE MUST APPEAL TO SOMETHING AL READY IN THE MIND THERE MUST BE IN THE MIND OF THE READER A CORRESPONDENCE SOME RESEMBLANCE SOMETHING WITH WHICH TO COMPARE HENCE A YOUNG CHILD COULD HAVE NO CONCEPTION OF PAR ADISE LOST FOR EXAMPLE NOW AS THE POWER OF EXPRESSION SHOULD GROW BY USE BOTH IN ORAL SPEECH AND IN WRITTEN LANGUAGE AS I HAVE ENDEAVORED TO POINT OUT AS THE THOUGHT SHOULD GROW CORRESPONDINGLY AND BE NOUR ISHED BY OBSERVATION AND READING AND BY EXPRESSION ALL ALONG THROUGH THE ELEMENTARY STAGES SO IT APPEARS TO ME THE STUDENTS OWN LANGUAGE SHOULD FORM THE BASIS OF HIS STUDY OF LITERATURE THAT IS TO SAY HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE STRUCTURE THE FORCE AND THE BEAUTY OF THE LANGUAGE SHOULD BE DEVELOPED FROM WITHIN  SHOULD BE A GROWTH AND NOT A MERE ACCRETION 205THE SCHOOL REVIEW TO BEGIN AGAIN AT THE BOTTOM IS SPELLING TO BE LEARNED  THE WORDS ONE USES ARE OF MOST INTEREST IS THE GRAMMATICAL STRUCTURE OF THE SENTENCE TO BE STUDIED  FOR THIS STUDY THE PUPILS OWN LANGUAGE SHOULD BE EXAMINED IT IS HIS OWN HE KNOWS WHAT IT MEANS AND HE CAN THEREFORE MORE EASILY APPRECIATE THE FORCE WHICH HE HAS PUT INTO EVERY PART OF IT AND CAN UNDERSTAND THE EFFECT UPON THE SENSE WHICH ANY MODIFICATION OF ITS FORM AND STRUCTURE MAY PRODUCE IS RHETORIC TO BE LEARNED  HOW CAN THE NATURE OF A FIGURE OF SPEECH BE BETTER UNDERSTOOD BY THE STUDENT THAN BY RECOGNIZING THE ONE WHICH HE HIMSELF HAS USED THE SAME IS TRUE OF THE ORDERLY AND EFFECTIVE ARRANGEMENT OF WORDS AND OF EVERY OTHER PRINCIPLE OF RHETORIC THE STUDENT MAY STUDY GRAMMAR INDEFINITELY BUT HE WILL NEVER REALLY KNOW GRAMMAR TILL HE HAS USED THE LANGUAGE AND IT IS BETTER FOR HIM TO STUDY THE GRAMMAR IN HIS LANGUAGE THAN TO ATTEMPT TO LEARN THE GRAMMAR AND THEN TO CONFORM HIS LANGUAGE TO IT HE MAY STUDY RHETORIC FOR YEARS WITHOUT APPRECIATING FULLY WHAT IT IS UNLESS HE HAS PUT ITS PRINCIPLES IN PRACTICE IN ACTUAL WRITING NOT MERELY IN INVENTING EXAMPLES AND DISSECTING THE EXAMPLES OF OTHER PEOPLE WHICH IS GENERALLY WORSE THAN A WASTE OF TIME DOES ANY BODY SUPPOSE THAT ANY ONE OF OUR GREAT WRITERS MACAULAY FOR EXAMPLE WHILE WRITING EVER STOPPED TO SAY TO HIMSELF  NOW I WILL INTRODUCE A STRIKING METAPHOR  NOW I WILL SET FORTH THIS INCIDENT IN A BRILLIANT PERIOD   HE COULD NOT HAVE MADE THOSE GLOWING SEN TENCES OF HIS IN SUCH A WAY IF HE HAD TRIED HE WAS FULL OF HIS SUBJECT AND THE WRITING AND THE ILLUSTRATIONS WERE PERFECTLY SPON TANEOUS MUCH LESS CAN ANY YOUNG STUDENT WRITE WELL WHEN HE IS THINKING OF WRITING WELL INSTEAD OF THINKING OF HIS SUBJECT AND WHAT HE HAS TO SAY ABOUT IT IN THE STUDY OF GRAMMAR WHICH IS THE STUDY OF ENGLISH I WOULD HAVE EVERY PRINCIPLE POINTED OUT IN THE LANGUAGE WHICH THE PUPIL HAS USED THOSE GRAND DIVISIONS THE SUBJECT AND THE PREDI CATE THAT WHICH IS SPOKEN OF AND THAT WHICH IS SAID MAY BE POINTED OUT VERY EARLY THE USES OF WORDS IN THE SENTENCE AS NOUNS VERBS ADJECTIVES ETC MAY BE MADE VERY CLEAR BY REFER ENCE TO THE CHILDS OWN WRITING OR SPEAKING ALL THE REST MAY BE FOUND IN SOME ONE OF THE BRIEF MANUALS SUCH AS THE FIRST CHAPTERS OF FOUNDATIONS OF RHETORIC LATELY ISSUED BY PROFESSOR HILL OF HARVARD AND THE MANUAL OF ENGLISH COMPOSITION BY NICHOLS PUBLISHED BY MACMILLAN  CO 206THE STUDY OF ENGLISH IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THE REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ALREADY REFERRED TO IT IS NOTED THAT SKILL IN ATHLETIC SPORTS CANNOT BE ACQUIRED FROM BOOKS IT MUST BE ATTAINED BY PRACTICE IF AT ALL AND THE VALUE OF THE SCIENTIFIC INSTRUCTION IN THE BOOKS CONSISTS IN DIRECTING MERELY AND CORRECT ING THE PRACTICE THE SAME IS TRUE IN LEARNING THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND THE INFERENCE FROM THE REPORT IS THAT STUDENTS COME TO HARVARD WELL FITTED IN ATHLETICS AND POORLY PREPARED IN EN GLISH THIS INFERENCE UNDOUBTEDLY CORRESPONDS TO THE FACTS AND MY AIM IS TO INTRODUCE INTO THE LEARNING OF ENGLISH THE PRIN CIPLE OF PRACTICE NOW USED IN LEARNINLG THE ATHLETICS BUT THE STUDY OF ENGLISH DOES NOT CONSIST MERELY IN LEARNING HOW TO USE THE LANGUAGE THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE STUDY IS TO MINE FROM THE LITERATURE THE TREASURES EMBEDDED THERE IV FOR THE THOROUGH OR EVEN A PARTIAL DISCUSSION OF THIS IM PORTANT PART OF THE STUDY OF ENGLISH THERE IS NOT NOW TIME NOR IS THERE VERY MUCH NECESSITY BECAUSE THE GROUND HAS BEEN CARE FULLY COVERED IN THE VARIOUS WORKS IN THE TEACHING OF LITERATURE THE LATEST TO COME UNDER MY OBSERVATION AND ONE OF THE BEST IS A LITTLE WORK ENTITLED LONGER ENGLISH POEMS EDITED BY J W HALES MA AND PUBLISHED BY MACMILLAN  CO LONDON AND NEW YORK TO SHOW WHAT MAY BE DONE IN THE STUDY OF ANY SELECTION OF PROSE OR POETRY IN AN INTRODUCTORY ESSAY SUGGESTIONS ON THE TEACH ING OF ENGLISH THE AUTHOR HAS TAKEN UP SCOTTS ROSABELLE  THE PIECE IS FIRST LEARNED BY HEART ITS MEANING IS NEXT CONSIDERED MI NOR SUBSIDIARY MATTERS ALLUSIONS TO MANNERS AND CUSTOMS ETC ARE THEN TAKEN UP HEREUPON THE QUESTION OF PROSODY OR OF RHYTHM RE CEIVES CONSIDERATION SOMETHING ABOUT THE AUTHOR COMES NEXT AND MATTERS OF GRAMMAR FOLLOW THE WORDS OF ROSABELLE ARE STUDIED WITH REFERENCE TO DERIVATION AND ORIGIN AND FINALLY THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE POEM HAVING BEEN CONSIDERED IN ITS VARIOUS ASPECTS AN ATTEMPT AT CRITICISM MAY BE ENCOURAGED AND A RECAPITULA TION OF THE WHOLE IS ADVISABLE AFTER SOME SUCH LESSON AS THAT JUST ATTEMPTED THE AUTHOR GOES ON TO SAY PROPER CURTAILMENTS AND EXPANSIONS HAVING BEEN MADE WILL NOT THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE PUPIL HAVE BEEN THOROUGHLY EXERCISED WILL NOT HIS PREVIOUSLY ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE HAVE BEEN CALLED INTO USE AND ARRANGED BETTERWILL HE NOT HAVE ADDED SOMETHING TO THAT BETTER ORDERED STORE WILL HE NOT WHILE AWAKING TO A PLEASANT CONSCIOUSNESS OF WHAT THE POWER OF HIS MIND IS AND WHAT APPAR 207THE SCHOOL REVIEW ENT ENTANGLEMENTS IT CAN UNRAVEL IF PROPERLY TRAINED AND DIRECTED LEARN ALSO HOW MUCH THERE IS THAT IS BEYOND HIS REACH AND HOW OF WHAT LIES WITHIN HIS REACH THE BETTER PART MAY NOT BE WON WITHOUT DUST AND HEATLEARN THE GREAT LESSON WHICH CONCERNS NOT ONLY HIS SCHOOLBOY DAYS BUT ALL THE DAYS OF HIS LIFE THAT THERE IS NOTHING WORTHY TO BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT SINCERE UNDAUNTED NEVER WEARYING INDUSTRY   FOR THIS KIND OF STUDY I COMMEND THE LITTLE POEM ON COLUMBIAS EMBLEM THE GOLDEN CORN TO BE RECOGNIZED I TRUST AS THE TYPI CAL PLANT OF

Gladston v Minnesota 17 Sup Ct 627 the Supreme Court of the United States sustains the validity of a State statute re quiring railroad companies to stop all passenger trains save those entering the State from other States at stations at county seats Such a regulation is held not to be an interference with interstate commerce nor with the carrying of the United States mails but is a valid exercise of the police power of the State The case is distinguished from the recent case of Illinois Cent R Co v Illinois 163 U S 142 where a statute was declared invalid which required a fast train carrying interstate passengers and the United States mails from Chicago in the State of Illinois to places in other States south of the Ohio river over an interstate high way established by authority of Congress to delay the transportation of such pas sengers and mails by turning aside from the direct interstate route and running to a station three miles and a half away from a point on that route and back again to the same point and thus traveling seven miles which formed no part of its course before proceeding on its way and as the court observed the question whether a statute which merely required interstate railroad trains without going out of their course to stop at county seats would be within the constitutional power of the State was not presented Another recent case upholding the police power of the State in connection with interstate transportation is New York etc R Co v New York 17 Sup Ct 418 where a New York statute prohibiting the heating of passenger cars by stoves on railroads over fifty miles long was held valid MECHANICS LIENSPUBLIC PROPERTYA bridge built on a county road under a contract with the county is held in First National Bank v Malheur County Or 35 L R A 141 to be exempt from liability to mechanics liens because of the public character of the bridge The annotation to the case reviews the other authorities as to mechanics liens on public property It seems to be a well settled principle that for reasons of public policy public buildings and structures are not subject to mechanics liens although they are not expressly excepted in the statute conferring the lien Thus it has been repeat edly held that courthouses jails firedepartment buildings county bridges public school houses municipal waterworks and buildings connected therewith are not subject to such liens Judge Dillon says on this subject It is clear that prop erty owned by a municipal corporation and used for public purposes cannot be sold by virtue of an execution issued on a judgment rendered against the corpora tion As one of the results of this general rule there is no right to a mechanics lien against such property Thus county bridges schoolhouses courthouses and other public buildings which cannot be sold under an execution cannot with out a plain statute to that effect be sold on foreclosure of a mechanics lien  it is only such property as can be sold under judicial process that is subject to such lien Laws creating liens in favor of mechanics are enacted with reference to that class of property which may be so sold The remedy of the mechanic is to obtain judgment against the municipal corporation and then to enforce its payment by mandamus 2 Dillon Municipal Corp 4th Ed 577 See further on the sub ject Leonard v City of Brooklyn 71 N Y 498 27 Am

public necessity must for the same reason be equally exempt from the operation of the mechanics lien law unless it appears by the law itself that property of this description was meant to be included and to warrant this inference something more must appear than the ordinary provisions that the claim is to be a lien against a particular class of property enforceable as judgments rendered in other civil actions See also 2 Jones on Liens 1375 NEGATIVE TESTIMONYThe following extract from Judge Tuckers opinion in Rowton v Rowton 1 H  M 91 96 will serve admirably for quotation by counsel in sustaining the positive evidence of his single witness against the multi tude of hostile witnesses whose testimony is merely negative We commend it specially to railroad counsel whose engineerwitness swears that the whistle blew and the bell rang he remembers it because he put it down in his little note book Mem  Killed a brindled steer got on the track right in front of engine blew whistle rang bell and put down airbrakes while the whole neighborhood swears that no alarum of bell or shriek of whistle went upward with the soul of that brindled ox The italics are in the original  I consider it an undeniable position both at law and in equity that one wit ness whose credibility is not impeached who deposes clearly and positively in affirmation of any fact to which that witness was privy is entitled to more belief than a dozen witnesses who merely depose to their own ignorance of that particu lar fact though by possibility they might have been in such a situation as to have seen or heard the same if their attention had been called to the acts or words of the parties at the time As if a question were made upon the plea of nil debet at law whether the supposed endorser of a bill of exchange actually did write his name on the back of it if one witness present in a coffeehouse or exchange innuendo saloon should swear that he saw the party write his name upon the bill such evidence if the credit of the witness be unimpeached ought to weigh more than the testimony of a dozen persons present in the same coffeehouse at the same time who should swear that they did not see himn write his name on the bill though all of them were in such situations as that by possibility they might have seen him do so or might have remembered that he did so had their atten tion been equally drawn that way as that of the witness affirming the fact And such testimony ought moreover to countervail that of fifty witnesses declaring that they heard the supposed indorser declare that he never indorsed a bill of exchange in his life nor ever would as long as he should live BAR EXAMINATIONS IN VIRGINIAAs an aid to candidates for admission to the bar in this State we publish below a form of

Ct 619 the Supreme Court of the United States holds that the owner of unused internal revenue stamps has an insurable interest therein notwithstanding that the commissioner of revenue is authorized by statute to replace the loss by other stamps or to refund amount paid for them And the insurance companies having paid the loss they are held entitled to recover in the name of the insured the value of the stamps from the government by way of subrogation The court further held on what would seem to be the soundest principle that as between the government and the insured suing for the benefit of the insurer the question of interest of the insured in the subjectmatter of the insurance was one of indifference since the govern ment was bound to refund the value of the destroyed stamps and the insurance company having seen fit to pay the loss without raising the question of interest the government was not concerned in the destination of tile amount to be refunded Mr Justice Peckham in delivering the opinion of the court said  When the stamps have been destroyed under the circumstances detailed in this case and those who paid for them apply to the government to be reimbursed for their value what materiality is there in the fact that the applicant has been paid the value of such stamps by an insurance company under and by virtue of a sepa rate contract made with that company on the part of the claimant upon good con sideration That circumstance does not alter the fact that the government has been paid for the stamps which were to be used for a certain purposethe pay ment of taxes thereafter to become due the governmentand that by reason of the destruction of the stamps by fire they cannot be used for the purpose for which they were intended Whatever sales of tobacco might be thereafter effected by the tobacco company would have to be evidenced by the attaching of other stamps upon the packages sold Unless therefore the government repaid the value of these stamps so destroyed or provided other stamps in lieu thereof without any further payment the government would be in the position of one who retained money to which it had no equitable right It would be no answer to that fact to show that some other person had reimbursed the claimant the amount it had paid for the stamps That would not alter the position of the government We cannot think that the payment to the claimant by the insurance companies ab solved the government in the slightest degree from the duty under that statute of paying back the money which it had received and for which it had delivered stamps that had been destroyed by fire before the contemplated use of them hadMISCELLANEOUS NOTES been made Whether or not the insurance companies could have made a success ful defense to the extent of the value of the stamps in question to an action on their policies by the assured because of an alleged lack of insurable interest in the stamps by the assured is beside the question They were not bound to make such defense Having received the premiums they had the right to fulfill their contract and the tobacco company after such payment might still ask the govern ment to pay to it the value of the stamps in order that it might thereafter repay the insurance companies The government loses nothing by payment in such case It simply repays money which it has no equitable right to retain The technical question of insurable interest does not arise in this case which involves simply the construction of the statute cited and the right of the claimant to recover As was said in Mason v Sainsbury 3 Dougl 60 64 by Mansfield Lord Chief Justice in reference to a defense of payment by the insurance companies The case is clear the act puts the hundred for civil purposes in the place of the trespassers and upon principles of policy as in the case of other remedies against the hundred I am satisfied that it is to be considered as if the insurers had not paid a farthing This was a case against the hundred upon a statute making it liable for damages to property caused by a mob Although the insurance company had paid the damages the action in the name of the owner of the property was sustained ex actly the same as if there had been no payment by the insurers The liability of the hundred under the statutes was not thereby in the least affected This case under the statute cited is still stronger because the government suffers no actual loss by the repayment while it would secure an unjust and inequitable profit by its refusal to pay We are also of opinion that the tobacco company had an insurable interest in the stamps It owned them absolutely having purchased and paid for them The right of reimbursement under the conditions named in the statute did not affect that insurable interest nor prevent the possibility of loss or prejudice arising from the destruction of the stamps Because an owner of property may be able to reimburse himself in case of its destruction from other sources is no reason for denying to such owner an insurable interest in the property An owner has an insurable interest in his property to the extent of the value of the building on it notwithstanding the existence of a mortgage on the property sufficient to absorb it Per Bradley J in Royal Ins Co v Stinson 103 U S 25 29 May Ins secs 81 82 The amount of interest or its character is not material in determining the question whether a party who attempts to recover under ra policy has an insur able interest Royal Ins Co v Stinson supra May Ins secs 81 82 In Tyler v Ricamore 76 Va 443 the right of subrogation was enforced in favor of an insurance company which had insured certain property afterwards burned by the negligence of a railroad company The insurance company having paid the loss successfully sustained a recovery against the railroad company in the name of the assured to the extent of the amount paid under the policy notwith standing that the defendant pleaded a release by the assured after action brought See further on the right of subrogation in cases of this character Phoenix Ins Co v Erie etc Co 117 U S 312 Wager v Providence etc Co 150 U S 99 An derson v Miller Tenn 33 S W 615 Mobile Ins Co v Columbia etc R Co S C 44 Am St Rep 725 and extensive note A difficult question under this head and one upon which there seems to be little 1897 155156 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER June discussion in the books is whether a life insurance company which has been obliged to pay a loss by reason of the death of the assured caused by the wrong ful act of a third person may recover the loss or any part of it from tile wrong doer It is a settled doctrine that where the right of subrogation exists at all it s necessarily restricted to such rights as the insured had Hence at common law where the death of the insured is caused by the wrongful act of a third person the insurer has no right of recovery by subrogation since the insured himself or his representatives had no such right Mobile Life Ins Co v Brame 95 iJ S 754 Nor was there ground for an independent action by tile insurer in his own right and in his own name both because of the lack of privity and of the remoteness of the injury Connecticut Mut Life Ins Co v New York etc R Co 25 Conn 265 65 Am Dec 571 Rockingham Miut Fire Ins Co v Boshe 39 Me 253 63 Am Dec 618 This doctrine while admitted to be the law is severely criticised in 2 May on Insurance Analysis of ch XXIII sec 453 These cases and others many of which are cited in the leading case of Mit Life Ins Co v New York etc R Co supra clearly establish the principle that one who destroys the life or property of another does not in legal contemplation injure third persons not in privity with the wrongdoer or to whom he owes no special dutyand hence that an insurance company is not in a legal sense injured by a wrong done to the per son or property of the insured which wrong the insurer by virtue of his policy is obliged to make good If the insurer has any rigllt at all it is a right to stand in the shoes of the insured after he has fully indemnified the latter for his loss But how is the question of the life insurers right of subrogation affected by Lord Campbells Act which hlas been adopted with more or less modifications in most of thle States The solution of this question would seem to depend upon the terms of the Act and of tlle policy If the statute gives the right of action to the personal representative for the benefit of the estate of the deceased and the policy is payable to the insuredl himself or his representatives then on principle the insurers right to subrogation ought to exist But if either of these features were lackingif the policy were payable to the wife and children for example and the recovery for the wrongfill death were by the statute made a part of the decedents estateor doubtless though the latter were directed by statute to be distributed amongst the wife and childrenthe right of subrogation would seem to fail See Mobile Life Ins Co v Brame supra In Virginia the recovery for the wrongful death is assets for the estate only in case the decedent leaves no wife husband parent or child Va Code 1887 sees 29034 It would appear therefore that in Virginia if A whose life is insured by tlle X company in the sum of 10000 by a policy payable to himself or his representatives should be killed by the wrongful act of a railroad company leaving none of the relatives mentioned in the statute upon payment of the loss under its policy the insurance company would be entitled by subrogation to whatever amount the personal rep resentatives might recover in action against the railroad company in the way of damages for his deathbut not otherwise NATIONAL BANKS LIABILITY OF SHAREHOLDERS PLEDGEESIn the recent case of Pauly v State Loan  Trust Co 17 Sup Ct 463 an important ruling is made by the Supreme Court of the United States with respect to theMISCELLANEOUS NOTES liability of pledgees of the shares in national banking associations The point involved was whether one who is in fact a pledgor of shares and who is regis tered as such on the official list of shareholders is liable to assessment as a share holder when the bank becomes insolvent So far as it involves this precise point the case is one of first impression though kindred questions have frequently come up before the court for adjudication In an extremely interesting opinion by Mr Justice Harlan the court holds that the pledgee in such case is not responsible as a shareholder The court had already held in Pullman v Upton 96 U S 328 that one who held such shares in his own name and appeared on the official list as the legal owner could not evade responsibility by proof that he was in fact a mere pledgee A somewhat similar decision was made in Germania National Bank v Case 99 U S 628 wlere a pledgee corporation after default by the pledgor and under power granted in the contract of pledge had the shares transferred to itself presumably as purchaser and subsequently to escape liability transferred them to one of its clerks with an understanding tlat he should hold merely as agent for the trans ferror Upon the failure of the bank the transferror as real owner was held liable to assessment upon the shares though they stood in the name of anotherthe latter being regarded merely as a man of straw To the same effect is Bowden v Johnson 107 U S 251 Another phase of the pledgees liability is presented in Anderson v Warehouse Co 111 U S 479 In that case the shares were registered in the name of the pledgee apparently as real owner but were within a few days retransferred to an employee of the pledgee who executed to the latter an irrevocable power of attorney to control tile shares under the original contract of pledge The bank was then solvent and the pledgor regularly received the dividendsthe pledgee neither being held out as a shareholder nor enjoying the privileges as such It was lield that there was no ground upon vwhich the pledgor could be held responsible In discussing the liability of the pledgee who appears as such on the official register of shareholders Mr Justice Iarlan says in the most recent case men tioned above  It is true that one who does not in fact invest his money in such shares but who although receiving them simply as collateral security for debts or obligations holds himrself out on the books of the association as true owner may be treated as the owner and therefore liable to assessment when the association beconmes in solvent and goes into the hands of a receiver But this is upon the ground that by allowing his name to appear upon the stock list as owner lie represents that he is such owner anll hle will not be permitted after the bank fails and when an assessment is made to assume any other position as against creditors If as be tween creditors and the person assessed the latter is not lleld bound by that rep resentation the list of shareholders required to be kept for the inspection of creditors and others would lose most of its value  But this rule can have no just application when as in this case the creditors were informed by that list that the party to whom certificates were issued was not in fact and did not assliume to be the owner of the shares represented by them but was and assumed to be only a pledgee having no general property in the thing pledged but only a right upon default to sell in satisfaction of the pledgors obligation Upon inspecting the stock registry or any list of shareholders or of 1897 157VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER transfers kept by the bank creditors will know that they cannot regard a pledgee as the actual owner If the certificates in question had been extended so as to give the name of the pledgor it would not be supposed that upon any principle of justice or upon grounds of public policy the pledgee could have been held to the liability imposed by section 5151 upon shareholders But the liability being purely statutory the result ought not to be different because of the circumstance that the name of the pledgor was omitted from the certificates since that which did appear in them was sufficient to inform creditors that the State Loan  Trust Company was only a pledgee and by slight diligence they could have ascertained the name of the pledgor  It may be suggested that if the pledgee is not held liable as a shareholder in respect of the shares of stock standing in its name as pledgee then no one is lia ble to assessment as the owner of such stock But it is a mistake to suppose that Havermale and Collins pledgors ceased to be shareholders for the purposes of the liability imposed by section 5151 They remained notwithstandingthe pledge the actual owners of the stock a right which they would have promptly asserted if the pledgee had assumed to be the owners and had sold the stock appropriating to itself all the proceeds of sale The object of the statute is not to be defeated by the mere forms of transactions between shareholders and their creditors The courts will look at the relations of parties as they actually are or as by reason of their conduct they must be assumed to be for the protection of creditors Con gress did not say that those only should be regarded as shareholders liable for the contracts debts and engagements of the banking association whose names appear on the stock list distinctly as shareholders A mistake or error in keeping the official list of shareholders would not prevent creditors from holding liable all who were in fact the real owners of the stock and as such had invested money in the shares of the association As already indicated those may be treated as shareholders within the meaning of section 5151 who are the real owners of the stock or who hold themselves out or allow themselves to be held out as owners in such way and under such circumstances as upon principles of fair dealing will estop them as against creditors from claiming that they were not in fact owners From the adjudicated cases the opinion deduces the following rules relating to the shareholders liability in national banking associations 1  That the real owner of the shares of the capital stock of a national bank ing association may in every case be treated as a shareholder within the meaning of section 5151 2 That if the owner transfers his shares to another person as collateral security f6r a debt due to the latter from such owner and if by the direction or with the knowledge of the pledgee the shares are placed on the books of the association in such way as to imply that the pledgee is the real owner then the pledgee may be treated qs a shareholder within the meaning of section 5151 of the Revised Statutes of the United States and therefore liable upon the basis pre scribed by that section for the contracts debts and engagements of the association 3  That if the real owner of the shares transfers them to another person or causes them to be placed on the books of the association in the name of another person with the intent simply to evade the responsibility imposed by section 5151 on shareholders of national banking associations such owner may be treated for the purposes of that section as a shareholder and liable as therein prescribed 158 June1897 MISCELLANEOUS NOTES 159 4 That if one receives shares of the stock of a national banking association as collateral security to him for a debt due from the owner with power of at torney authorizing him to transfer the same on the books of the association and being unwilling to incur the responsibilities of a shareholder as prescribed by the statute causes the shares to be transferred on such books to another under an agreement that they are to be held as security for the debt due from the real owner to his creditorthe latter acting in good faith and for the purpose only of securing the payment of that debt without incurring the responsibility of a shareholder he the creditor will not although the real owner may be treated as a share holder within the meaning of section 5151  and 5 That if the owner of the shares transfers them to another person as col lateral security for a debt and the shares are registered on the books of the associ ation in the name of the creditor as pledgeethe latter acting in good faith and for the purpose only of securing the payment of the debtsuch pledgee will not be treated as a shareholder within the meaning of section 5151 It may be observed that by special provision of sec 5152 of the Revised Statutes of the United States it is provided that persons holding stock as executors administrators guardians or trustees shall not be personally subject to any liabil ities as stockholders but the estates and funds in their hands shall be liable in like manner and to the same extent as the testator intestate ward or person inter ested in such funds would be if living and competent to act and hold the stock in his own name THE LAW AND THE LADYBy the Constitution of the American Bar Asso ciation it is made the duty of the President  to open each annual meeting of the Association with an address in which he shall communicate the most noteworthy changes in statute law on points of general interest made in the several States and by Congress during the preceding year In performing this task President Moorfield Storey communicated the following changes on a point of general interest under the head of Amusements Report Am Bar Assn 1896 p 234  Under this head come the statutes intended to prevent women from interfering with the pleasure of others by wearing hats at theatres It is melancholy to con fess that such laws are necessary for it would seem impossible that any woman should be willing to make a public parade of her petty selfishness and vanity but we find them in the statute books of Ohio and Louisiana It is more melancholy still however from the masculine standpoint to find in these statutes a public confession that the woman no longer conclusively presumed to act under her hus bands coercion is beyond the control even of the law Instead of boldly grap pling with the evil forbidding either man or woman to wear any hat which ob structs the view of other spectators and imposing a penalty for disobedience the cowardly legislature in each State has shirked the responsibility and imposes a penalty on the proprietor or manager who allows any person to wear such a head dress thus throwing upon this helpless individual with no legal power to enforce his commands a task which the State itself with the entire police power of the community at its back is afraid to undertake  In Louisiana indeed the legislature is yet more pusillanimous for after boldly imposing its penalty it adds a proviso which permits an opera bonnet to be worn160 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER June I may be pardoned for expressing the strong sympathy which I feel for the the atrical managers of Louisiana thus forced by law to decide in a pie poudre court in the presence of an audience of whom perhaps half are actively hostile and the rest hopelessly cowed to what legal class a particular bonnet belongs PRESUMIPTIONS OF FACTPRESUMPTIONS OF INNOCENCEIn the case of Dun lop v United States 17 Sup Ct 375 Mr Justice Brown clearly states the doctrine as to when the presumption of the innocence of the accused will not prevail over other presumptions of fact The defendant was charged with sending through the mails copies of a newspaper of which he was publisher containing obscene advertisements There was no direct evidence that the newspaper in question was deposited in the mails by authority of the accused but there was abundant testimony establishing the fact that the paper had a large daily circulation through the postoffice and that the copies produced in evidence were found in the private letterbox of the postoffice inspector where it was the duty of the delivery clerks to deposit the inspectors mail and that he had regularly received his mail in that way for ten years and that the copy was received in response to an order sent by him through the mail to the publisher The accused asked for an instruction that while such testimony might ordinarily raise a presumption that the paper was sent by the accused and through the mail yet such presumption could not prevail over the legal presumption of innocence The position of the defendant in this case says Mr Justice Brown  is that the presumption of the defendants innocence in a criminal case is stronger than any presumption except the presumption of the defendants sanity and the pre sumption of knowledge of the law and that he was entitled to a direct charge that the presumption of the defendants innocence was stronger than the presumption that the messengers who deposited these papers in their proper boxes took them from the mails If it were broadly true that the presumption of innocence over rides every other presumption except those of sanity and knowledge of the law it would be impossible to convict in any case upon circumstantial evidence since the gist of such evidence is that certain facts may be inferred or presumed from proof of other facts Thus if property recently stolen be found in the possession of a certain person it may be presumed that he stole it and such presumption is sufficient to authorize the jury to convict notwithstanding the presumption of his innocence So if a person be stabbed to death and another who was last seen in his company were arrested near the spot with a bloody dagger in his possession it would raise in the absence of explanatory evidence a presumption of fact that he had killed him So if it were shown that the shoes of an accused person were of peculiar size or shape and footmarks were found in the mud or snow of cor responding size or shape it would raise a presumption more or less strong accord ing to the circumstances that these marks had been made by the feet of the accused person It is true that it is stated in some of the authorities that where there are conflicting presumptions the presumption of innocence will prevail against the presumption of the continuance of life the presumption of the continuance of things generally the presumption of marriage and the presumption of chastity But this is said with reference to a class of presumptions which prevail inde pendently of proof to rebut the presumption of innocence or what may be termed abstract presumptions Thus in the prosecution for seduction or for enticing anMISCELLANEOUS NOTES unmarried female to a house of illfame it is necessary to aver and prove affirma tively the chastity of the female notwithstanding the general presumption in favor of her chastity since this general presumption is overridden by the pre sumption of the innocence of the accused People v Roderigas 49 Cal 9 Cor v Whittaker 131 Mass 224 West v State 1 Wis 209 Zabriskie v State 43 N J Law 640 1 Greenl Ev 35 This rule however is confined to cases where proof of the facts raising the presumption has no tendency to establish the guilt of the de fendant and has no application where such proof constitutes a link in the chain of evidence against him In such cases as the one under consideration it is not so much a question of comparative presumptions one against the other as one of the weight of evidence to prove a certain fact namelyl that these papers were taken from the mails It was a question for the jury to say whether the facts proven in this connection satisfied them beyond a reasonable doubt and notwith standing the presumption of innocence that these papers were taken from the mails and the abstract instructions requested would only have tended to confuse them since if literally followed it would have compelled a verdict of acquittal It may be observed that the dictum of the court as to presumption of innocence overriding that of chastity of the female in a prosecution for seduction is contrary to the doctrine established in the Virginia cases of Barker v Commonwealth 90 Va 820 823 and Mills v Commonwealth 2 Va Law Reg 675 There is some confusion in the books on this subject due in large part to a failure to note the peculiar language of the statutes of seduction upon which the various decisions are based Some of the statutes as in Virginia make the previous chastity of the female an express condition while in others her previous chaste character is made an essential element of the crime by construction The preponderance of authority seems to be largely in favor of the doctrine that where the statute in express terms prescribes that the female shall be of previous chaste character the pre sumption of innocence prevails over that of chastity and the burden is on the commonwealth to establish the latter but if the chaste character of the female is made an element of the offense merely by construction and as necessarily pres ent in order to constitute seduction since an unchaste female cannot be seduced  then the presumption of chastity will prevail over that of the inno cence of the accused Thus the case of People v Brewer 27 Mich 134 upon which Barker v Common wealth supra is mainly based rests upon the Michigan statute which does not in express terms make the chastity of the prosecutrix an element of the offense Judge Cooley who delivered the opinion distinguishes the case from other ap parently conflicting cases on that very ground The case of Polk v State 40 Ark 482 also cited in Barker v Commonwealth is likewise not in point since the statute under which the indictment was formed did not make the chastity of the female an element of the crime the language being  obtaining carnal knowledge of any female by virtue of any feigned or pretended marriage or of any false or feigned promise of marriage This opinion likewise points out the distinction noted above The same may be said of Wilson v State 73 Ala 527 also relied upon in the Virginia cases The cases of Oliver v Commonwealth 101 Pa St 215 47 Am Rep 704 State v Lockerby 50 Minn 363 36 Am St Rep 656 State v Eckler 106 Mo 585 27 Am 1897 161VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER St Rep 372 together with those of People v Roderigas 49 Cal 9 Commonwealth v Whittaker 131 Mass 221 West v State 1 Wis 209 and Zabriskie v State 43 N J Law 640 39 Am Rep 610 cited in Mr Justice Browns opinion are all con trary to the Virginia cases and all are based on statutes prescribing in express terms that the female shall be of previous chaste character or of good re pute or using similar words and in a somewhat careful search we have been able to find the doctrine of the Virginia cases of Barker v Commonwealth and Mills v Commonwealth upheld only in the State of Iowa State v McClintic 73 Iowa 663 Andre v State 5 Iowa 389 67 Am Dec 708 The same distinction in the language of the statutes is noted and discussed in Ferguson v State 71 Miss 805 42 Am St Rep 492 In the Zabriskie case cited above the New Jersey court thus states the doctrine Such presumption of chastity it is manifest would destroy the presump tion of innocence which is ever present as a protection to the accused and sub stitute for it the presumption of guilt A woman who comes into court with a bastard child in her arms is not a representative of her sex happily she repre sents a very insignificant portion of it The fact that she has sacrificed that vir tue which was her glittering crown casts such a shadow upon her that in the most charitable view of the case it should be left without presumption either way to be determined by competent evidence what her prior repute has been Her im moral conduct unless mitigating circumstances are shown classes her with the vicious and disreputable and as to her negatives the presumption of purity so universally accorded to her sex The question is not whether the vast majority of females are of good repute but whether in this case it shall be presumed as a fact against the defendant that the woman with whom the crime is alleged to have been committed and who carries with her the evidence of her shame is of good repute The rule if well founded must be of universal application and involves the broad proposition that of the entire class of women who bear illegiti mate children it must be presumed that every one who may prefer a charge of this kind is of good repute for chastity It will be more reasonable to reverse the presumption If the prosecutrix was upon trial for an offense which impeached her prior purity the law would humanely presume that no infirmity in that respect existed but when the character of this defendant who is equally entitled to the presump tion of innocence is assailed the fact of her good repute to overthrow and destroy that presumption must be affirmatively established by the prosecution 162 June

in the practise of the British Association Prom the foundation of our society until 1884 its meetings had always been held in the British Isles in that year however the association met in Montreal and a step was taken which changed us from an insular into an imperial associa tion For this change which now I think meets with nothing but approval Canada is mainly responsible Men of science wel come it for the increased opportunities it gives them of studying under the most pleasant and favorable conditions differ ent parts of our empire of making new friends such meetings as these not only promote the progress of science but also help to strengthen the bonds which bind together the different portions of the kings dominions This year for the third time in a quarter of a century we are meeting in Canada As if to give us an object lesson in the growth of empire you in Winnipeg took the opportunity at our first meeting in Canada in 1884 to invite our members to visit Manitoba and see for themselves the development of the province at that time Those who were fortunate enough to be your guests then as well as now are con fronted with a change which must seem to them unexampled and almost incredible Great cities have sprung up immense areas have been converted from prairies to pros perous farms flourishing industries have been started and the population has quad 1 Winnipeg 1909SCIENCE rupled As the president of a scientific association I hope I may be pardoned if I point out that even the enterprise and energy of your people and the richness of your country would have been powerless to effect this change without the resources placed at their disposal by the labors of men of science The eminence of my predecessors in the chair at the meetings of the British Asso ciation in Canada makes my task this even ing a difficult one The meeting at Mon treal was presided over by Lord Rayleigh who like Lord Kelvin his colleague in the chair of Section A at that meeting has left the lions mark on every department of physics and who has shown that vast as is the empire of physics there are still men who can extend its frontiers in all of the many regions under its sway It has been my lot to succeed Lord Rayleigh in other offices as well as this and I know how diffi cult a man he is to follow The president of the second meeting in Canadathat held in 1897 at Toronto was Sir John Evans one of those men who like Boyle Cavendish Darwin Joule and Huggins have from their own resources and without the aid derived from official positions or from the universities made memorable contributions to science such men form one of the characteristic features of British science May we not hope that as the knowledge of science and the interest taken in it increase more of the large num ber of men of independent means in our country may be found working for the advancement of science and thereby ren dering services to the community no less valuable than the political philanthropic and social work at which many of them labor with so much zeal and success I can however claim to have some ex perience of at any rate one branch of Canadian science for it has been my privi lege to receive at the Cavendish Laboratory many students from your universities Some of these have been holders of what are known as the 1851 scholarships These scholarships are provided from the surplus of the Great Exhibition of 1851 and are placed at the disposal of most of the younger universities in the British Empire to enable students to devote themselves for two or three years to original research in various branches of science I have had many opportunities of seeing the work of these scholars and I should like to put on record my opinion that there is no educa tional endowment in the country which has done or is doing better work I have had as I said the privilege of having as pupils students from your uni versities as well as from those of New Zealand Australia and the United States and have thus had opportunities of com paring the effect on the best men of the educational system in force at your uni versities with that which prevails in the older English universities Well as the result I have come to the conclusion that there is a good deal in the latter system which you have been wise not to imitate The chief evil from which we at Cambridge suffer and which you have avoided is I am convinced the excessive competition for scholarships which confronts our students at almost every stage of their education You may form some estimate of the preva lence of these scholarships if I tell you that the colleges in the University of Cambridge alone give more than 35000 a year in scholarships to undergraduates and I sup pose the case is much the same at Oxford The result of this is that preparation for these scholarships dominates the education of the great majority of the cleverer boys who come to these universities and indeed in some quarters it seems to be held that the chief duty of a schoolmaster and the 258 Na S VOL XXX Nio 705AUGUST 27 1909 best test of his efficiency is to make his boys get scholarships The preparation for the scholarship too often means that about two years before the examination the boy begins to specialize and from the age of sixteen does little else than the subject be it mathematics classics or natural science for which he wishes to get a scholarship then on entering the university he spends three or four years studying the same sub ject before he takes his degree when his real life work ought to begin How has this training fitted him for this work I will take the case in which the system might perhaps be expected to show to greatest advantage when his work is to be original research in the subject he has been studying He has certainly acquired a very minute acquaintance with his subject indeed the knowledge possessed by some of the students trained under this system is quite remarkable much greater than that of any other students I have ever met But though he has acquired knowledge the effect of studying one subject and one sub ject only for so long a time is too often to dull his enthusiasm for it and he begins research with much of his early interest and keenness evaporated Now there is hardly any quality more essential to suc cess in research than enthusiasm Research is difficult laborious often disheartening The carefully designed apparatus refuses to work it develops defects which may take months of patient work to rectify the results obtained may appear incon sistent with each other and with every known law of nature sleepless nights and laborious days may seem only to make the confusion more confounded and there is nothing for the student to do but to take for his motto Its dogged as does it and plod on comforting himself with the assurance that when success does come the difficulties he has overcome will increase the pleasureone of the most exquisite men cnh enjoyof getting some conception which will make all that was tangled con fused and contradictory clear and con sistent Unless he has enthusiasm to carry him on when the prospect seems almost hopeless and the labor and strain incessant the student may give up his task and take to easier though less important pursuits I am convinced that no greater evil can be done to a young man than to dull his enthusiasm In a very considerable ex perience of students of physics beginning research I have met with moremany morefailures from lack of enthusiasm and determination than from any lack of knowledge or of what is usually known as cleverness This continual harping from an early age on one subject which is so efficient in quenching enthusiasm is much encouraged by the practise of the colleges to give schol arships for proficiency in one subject alone I went through a list of the scholarships awarded in the University of Cambridge last winter and though there were 202 of them I could only find three cases in which it was specified that the award was made for proficiency in more than one subject The premature specialization fostered by the preparation for these scholarships in jures the student by depriving him of ade quate literary culture while when it ex tends as it often does to specialization in one or two branches of science it retards the progress of science by tending to isolate one science from another The boundaries between the sciences are arbitrary and tend to disappear as science progresses The principles of one science often find most striking and suggestive illustrations in the phenomena of another Thus for example the physicist finds in astronomy that effects he has observed in the labora tory are illustrated on the grand scale in SCIENCE 259N S VoL XXX No 765 the sun and stars No better illustration of this could be given than Professor Hales recent discovery of the Zeeman ef fect in the light from sunspots in chem istry too the physicist finds in the be havior of whole series of reactions illustra tions of the great laws of thermodynamics while if he turns to the biological sciences he is confronted by problems mostly un solved of unsurpassed interest Consider for a moment the problem presented by almost any plantthe characteristic and often exquisite detail of flower leaf and habitand remember that the mechanism which controls this almost infinite com plexity was once contained in a seed per haps hardly large enough to be visible We have here one of the most entrancing problems in chemistry and physics it is possible to conceive Again the specialization prevalent in schools often prevents students of science from acquiring sufficient knowledge of mathematics it is true that most of those who study physics do some mathematics but I hold that in general they do not do enough and that they are not as efficient physicists as they would be if they had a wider knowledge of that subject There seems at present a tendency in some quar ters to discourage the use of mathematics in physics indeed one might infer from the statements of some writers in quasi scientific journals that ignorance of mathe matics is almost a virtue If this is so then surely of all the virtues this is the easiest and most prevalent I do not for a moment urge that the physicist should confine himself to looking at his problems from the mathematical point of view on the contrary I think a famous French mathematician and physi cist was guilty of only slight exaggera tion when he said that no discovery was really important or properly understood by its author unless and until he could explain it to the first man he met in the street But two points of view are better than one an4 the physicist who is also a mathe matician possesses a most powerful instru ment for scientific research with which many of the greatest discoveries have been made for example electric waves were dis covered by mathematics long before they were detected in the laboratory He has also at his command a language clear con cise and universal and there is no better way of detecting ambiguities and discrep ancies in his ideas than by trying to express them in this language Again it often happens that we are not able to appreciate the full significance of some physical dis covery until we have subjected it to mathe matical treatment when we find that the effect we have discovered involves other effects which have not been detected and we are able by this means to duplicate the discovery Thus James Thomson starting from the fact that ice floats on water showed that it follows by mathematics that ice can be melted and water prevented from freezing by pressure This effect which was at that time unknown was after wards verified by his brother Lord Kelvin Multitudes of similar duplication of phys ical discoveries by mathematics could be quoted I have been pleading in the interests of physics for a greater study of mathematics by physicists I would also plead for a greater study of physics by mathematicians in the interest of pure mathematics The history of pure mathematics shows that many of the most important branches of the subject have arisen from the at tempts made to get a mathematical solution of a problem suggested by physics Thus the differential calculus arose from at tempts to deal with the problem of moving bodies Fouriers theorem resulted from 260 SCIENCEAUGUST 27 1909 attempts to deal with the vibrations of strings and the conduction of heat indeed it would seem that the most fruitful crop of scientific ideas is produced by cross fertilization between the mind and some definite fact and that the mind by itself is comparatively unproductive I think if we could trace the origin of some of our most comprehensive and im portant scientific ideas it would be found that they arose in the attempt to find an explanation of some apparently trivial and very special phenomenon when once started the ideas grew to such generality and importance that their modest origin could hardly be suspected Water vapor we know will refuse to condense into rain unless there are particles of dust to form nuclei so an idea before taking shape seems to require a nucleus of solid fact round which it can condense I have ventured to urge the closer union between mathematics and physics because I think of late years there has been some tendency for these sciences to drift apart and that the workers in applied mathemat ics are relatively fewer than they were some years ago This is no doubt due to some extent to the remarkable develop ments made in the last few years in experi mental physics on the one hand and in the most abstract and metaphysical parts of pure mathematics on the other The fas cination of these has drawn workers to the frontiers of these regions who would other wise have worked nearer the junction of the two In part too it may be due to the fact that the problems with which the ap plied mathematician has to deal are ex ceedingly difficult and many may have felt that the problems presented by the older physics have been worked over so often by men of the highest genius that there was but little chance of any problem which they could have any hope of solving being left But the newer developments of physics have opened virgin ground which has not yet been worked over and which offers problems to the mathematician of great interest and noveltyproblems which will suggest and require new methods of attack the development of which will advance pure mathematics as well as physics I have alluded to the fact that pure mathematicians have been indebted to the study of concrete problems for the orig ination of some of their most valuable conceptions but though no doubt pure mathematicians are in many ways very exceptional folk yet in this respect they are very human Most of us need to tackle some definite difficulty before our minds develop whatever powers they may possess This is true for even the youngest of us for our school boys and school girls and I think the moral to be drawn from it is that we should aim at making the education in our schools as little bookish and as prac tical and concrete as possible I once had an illustration of the power of the concrete in stimulating the mind which made a very lasting impression upon me One of my first pupils came to me with the assurance from his previous teacher that he knew little and cared less about mathematics and that he had no chance of obtaining a degree in that sub ject For some time I thought this esti mate was correct but he happened to be enthusiastic about billiards and when we were reading that part of mechanics which deals with the collision of elastic bodies I pointed out that many of the effects he was constantly observing were illustrations of the subject we were studying From that time he was a changed man He had never before regarded mathematics as anything but a means of annoying innocent under graduates now when he saw what impor tant results it could obtain he became en SCIENCE 261N S VOL XXX No 765 thusiastic about it developed very consid erable mathematical ability and though he had already wasted two out of his three years at college took a good place in the mathematical tripos It is possible to read books to pass exam inations without the higher qualities of the mind being called into play Indeed I doubt if there is any process in which the mind is more quiescent than in reading without interest I might appeal to the widespread habit of reading in bed as a prevention of insomnia as a proof of this But it is not possble for a boy to make a boat or for a girl to cook a dinner without using their brains With practical things the difficulties have to be surmounted the boat must be made watertight the dinner must be cooked while in reading there is always the hope that the difficulties which have been slurred over will not be set in the examination I think it was Helmholtz who said that often in the course of a research more thought and energy were spent in reducing a refractory piece of brass to order than in devising the method or planning the scheme of campaign This constant need for thought and action gives to original research in any branch of experimental science great educational value even for those who will not become professional men of science I have had considerable ex perience with students beginning research in experimental physics and I have always been struck by the quite remarkable im provement in judgment independence of thought and maturity produced by a years research Research develops quali ties which are apt to atrophy when the student is preparing for examinations and quite apart from the addition of new knowledge to our store is of the greatest importance as a means of education It is the practise in many universities to make special provision for the reception of students from other universities who wish to do original research or to study the more advanced parts of their subject and con siderable numbers of such students migrate from one university to another I think it would be a good thing if this practise were to extend to students at an earlier stage in their career especially should I like to see a considerable interchange of students between the universities in the mother country and those in the colonies I am quite sure that many of our English students especially those destined for pub lic life could have no more valuable ex perience than to spend a year in one or other of your universities and I hope some of your students might profit by a visit to ours I can think of nothing more likely to lead to a better understanding of the feel ings the sympathies and what is not less important the prejudices of one country by another than by the youths of those countries spending a part of their student life together Undergraduates as a rule do not wear a mask either of politeness or any other material and have probably a better knowledge of each others opinions and points of viewin fact know each other better than do people of riper age To bring this communion of students about there must be cooperation between the uni versities throughout the empire there must be recognition of each others examina tions residence and degrees Before this can be accomplished there must as my friend Mr E B Sargant pointed out in a lecture given at the McGill University be cooperation and recognition between the universities in each part of the empire I do not mean for a moment that all univer sities in a country should be under one government I am a strong believer in the individuality of universities but I do not 262 SCIENCESCIENCE think this is in any way inconsistent with the policy of an open door from one uni versity to every other in the empire It has usually been the practise of the president of this association to give some account of the progress made in the last few years in the branch of science which he has the honor to represent I propose this evening to follow that precedent and to attempt to give a very short account of some of the more recent developments of physics and the new con ceptions of physical processes to which they have led The period which has elapsed since the association last met in Canada has been one of almost unparalleled activity in many branches of physics and many new and unsuspected properties of matter and electricity have been discovered The his tory of this period affords a remarkable illustration of the effect which may be pro duced by a single discovery for it is I think to the discovery of the Rontgen rays that we owe the rapidity of the progress which has recently been made in physics A striking discovery like that of the RSnt gen rays acts much like the discovery of gold in a sparsely populated country it attracts workers who come in the first place for the gold but who may find that the country has other products other charms perhaps even more valuable than the gold itself The country in which the gold was discovered in the case of the Rontgen rays was the department of physics dealing with the discharge of electricity through gases a subject which almost from the beginning of electrical science had attracted a few enthusiastic workers who felt convinced that the key to unlock the secret of elec tricity was to be found in a vacuum tube Rontgen in 1895 showed that when elec tricity passed through such a tube the tube emitted rays which could pass through bodies opaque to ordinary light which could for example pass through the flesh of the body and throw a shadow of the bones on a suitable screen The fascina tion of this discovery attracted many work ers to the subject of the discharge of elec tricity through gases and led to great im provements in the instruments used in this type of research It is not however to the power of probing dark places impor tant though this is that the influence of Rontgen rays on the progress of science has mainly been due it is rather because these rays make gases and indeed solids and liquids through which they pass conduc tors of electricity It is true that before the discovery of these rays other methods of making gases conductors were known but none of these was so convenient for the purposes of accurate measurement The study of gases exposed to Rontgen rays has revealed in such gases the presence of particles charged with electricity some of these particles are charged with positive others with negative electricity The properties of these particles have been investigated we know the charge they carry the speed with which they move under an electric force the rate at which the oppositely charged ones recombine and these investigations have thrown a new light not only on electricity but also on the structure of matter We know from these investigations that electricity like matter is molecular in structure that just as a quantity of hydro gen is a collection of an immense number of small particles called molecules so a charge of electricity is made up of a great number of small charges each of a per fectly definite and known amount Helmholtz said in 1880 that in his opin ion the evidence in favor of the molecular constitution of electricity was even stronger than that in favor of the molecular consti AUGUST 27 1909 263N S VOL XXX No 765 tution of matter How much stronger is that evidence now when we have measured the charge on the unit and found it to be the same from whatever source the electric ity is obtained Nay further the molecu lar theory of matter is indebted to the mo lecular theory of electricity for the most accurate determination of its fundamental quantity the number of molecules in any given quantity of an elementary substance The great advantage of the electrical methods for the study of the properties of matter is due to the fact that whenever a particle is electrified it is very easily identified whereas an uncharged molecule is most elusive and it is only when these are present in immense numbers that we are able to detect them A very simple calculation will illustrate the difference in our power of detecting electrified and un electrified molecules The smallest quantity of unelectrified matter ever detected is probably that of neon one of the inert gases of the atmosphere Professor Strutt has shown that the amount of neon in one twentieth of a cubic centimeter of the air at ordinary pressures can be detected by the spectroscope Sir William Ramsay esti mates that the neon in the air only amounts to one part of neon in 100000 parts of air so that the neon in one twentieth of a cubic centimeter of air would only occupy at atmospheric pressure a volume of half a millionth of a cubic centimeter When stated in this form the quantity seems ex ceedingly small but in this small volume there are about ten million million molecules Now the population of the earth is estimated at about fifteen hundred millions so that the smallest number of molecules of neon we can identify is about 7000 times the population of the earth In other words if we had no better test for the existence of a man than we have for that of an unelectrified molecule we should come to the conclusion that the earth is unin habited Contrast this with our power of detecting electrified molecules We can by the electrical method even better by the cloud method of C T R Wilson detect the presence of three or four charged particles in a cubic centimeter Rutherford has shown that we can detect the presence of a single a particle Now the particle is a charged atom of helium if this atom had been uncharged we should have required more than a million million of them instead of one before we should have been able to detect them We may I think conclude since electri fied particles can be studied with so much greater ease than unelectrified ones that we shall obtain a knowledge of the ultimate structure of electricity before we arrive at a corresponding degree of certainty with regard to the structure of matter We have already made considerable progress in the task of discovering what the structure of electricity is We have known for some time that of one kind of electricitythe negativeand a very inter esting one it is We know that negative electricity is made up of units all of which are of the same kind that these units are exceedingly small compared with even the smallest atom for the mass of the unit is only 700 part of the mass of an atom of hydrogen that its radius is only 1013 centi meter and that these units corpuscles as they have been called can be obtained from all substances The size of these cor puscles is on an altogether different scale from that of atoms the volume of a cor puscle bears to that of the atom about the same relation as that of a speck of dust to the volume of this room Under suitable conditions they move at enormous speeds which approach in some instances the veloc ity of light The discovery of these corpuscles is an 264 SCIENCEAUGUST 27 1909 interesting example of e way nature re sponds to the demands made upon her by mathematicians Some years before the discovery of corpuscles it had been shown by a mathematical investigation that the mass of a body must be increased by a charge of electricity This increase how ever is greater for small bodies than for large ones and even bodies as small as atoms are hopelessly too large to show any appreciable effect thus the result seemed entirely academic After a time corpuscles were discovered and these are so much smaller than the atom that the increase in mass due to the charge becomes not merely appreciable but so great that as the ex periments of Kaufmann and Bucherer have shown the whole of the mass of the corpuscle arises from its charge We know a great deal about negative electricity what do we know about positive electricity Is positive electricity molecu lar in structure Is it made up into units each unit carrying a charge equal in magni tude though opposite in sign to that carried by a corpuscle  Does or does not this unit differ in size and physical properties very widely from the corpuscle We know that by suitable processes we can get corpuscles out of any kind of matter and that the cor puscles will be the same from whatever source they may be derived Is a similar thing true for positive electricity Can we get for example a positive unit from oxy gen of the same kind as that we get from hydrogen  For my own part I think the evidence is in favor of the view that we can although the nature of the unit of positive electricity makes the proof much more difficult than for the negative unit In the first place we find that the positive particles canalstrahlen is their tech nical namediscovered by our distin guished guest Dr Goldstein which are found when an electric discharge passes through a highly rarefied gas are when the pressure is very low the same what ever may have been the gas in the vessel to begin with If we pump out the gas until the pressure is too low to allow the dis charge to pass and then introduce a small quantity of gas and restart the discharge the positive particles are the same what ever kind of gas may have been introduced I have for example put into the ex hausted vessel oxygen argon helium the vapor of carbon tetrachloride none of which contain hydrogen and found the positive particles to be the same as when hydrogen was introduced Some experiments made lately by Wel lisch in the Cavendish Laboratory strongly support the view that there is a definite unit of positive electricity independent of the gas from which it is derived these ex periments were on the velocity with which positive particles move through mixed gases If we have a mixture of methyl iodide and hydrogen exposed to Rintgen rays the effect of the rays on the methyl iodide is so much greater than on the hydrogen that even when the mixture contains only a small percentage of methyl iodide practically all the electricity comes from this gas and not from the hydrogen Now if the positive particles were merely the residue left when a corpuscle had been abstracted from the methyliodide these particles would have the dimensions of a molecule of methyliodide this is very large and heavy and would therefore move more slowly through the hydrogen mole cules than the positive particles derived from hydrogen itself which would on this view be of the size and weight of the light hydrogen molecules Wellisch found that the velocities of both the positive and nega tive particles through the mixture were the same as the velocities through pure hydro gen although in the one case the ions had originated from methyliodide and in the SCIENCE 265N S VOL XXX No 765 other from hydrogen a similar result was obtained when carbon tetrachloride or mercury methyl was used instead of methyliodide These and similar results lead to the conclusion that the atoms of the different chemical elements contain definite units of positive as well as of negative electricity and that the positive electricity like the negative is molecular in structure The investigations made on the unit of positive electricity show that it is of quite a different kind from the unit of negative the mass of the negative unit is exceedingly small compared with any atom the only positive units that up to the present have been detected are quite comparable in mass with the mass of an atom of hydrogen in fact they seem equal to it This makes it more difficult to be certain that the unit of positive electricity has been isolated for we have to be on our guard against its being a much smaller body attached to the hydrogen atoms which happen to be present in the vessel If the positive units have a much greater mass than the negative ones they ought not to be so easily deflected by magnetic forces when moving at equal speeds and in general the insensibility of the positive particles to the influence of a magnet is very marked though there are cases when the positive particles are much more readily deflected and these have been interpreted as proving the existence of positive units comparable in mass with the negative ones I have found however that in these cases the positive particles are moving very slowly and that the ease with which they are deflected is due to the small ness of the velocity and not to that of the mass It should however be noted that M Jean Becquerel has observed in the absorp tion spectra of some minerals and Professor Wood in the rotation of the plane of polari zation by sodium vapor effects which could be explained by the presence in the sub stances of positive units comparable in mass with corpusctes This however is not the only explanation which can be given of these effects and at present the smallest positive electrified particles of which we have direct experimental evidence have masses comparable with that of an atom of hydrogen A knowledge of the mass and size of the two units of electricity the positive and the negative would give us the material for constructing what may be called a molecular theory of electricity and would be a startingpoint for a theory of the structure of matter for the most natural view to take as a provisional hypothesis is that matter is just a collection of positive and negative units of electricity and that the forces which hold atoms and imolecules together the properties which differentiate one kind of matter from another all have their origin in the electrical forces exerted by positive and negative units of electricity grouped together in different ways in the atoms of the different elements As it would seem that the units of posi tive and negative electricity are of very different sizes we must regard matter as a mixture containing systems of very differ ent types one type corresponding to the small corpuscle the other to the large posi tive unit Since the energy associated with a given charge is greater the smaller the body on which the change is concentrated the energy stored up in the negative cor puscles will be far greater than that stored up by the positive The amount of energy which is stored up in ordi nary matter in the form of the electro static potential energy of its corpuscles is I think not generally realized All sub stances give out corpuscles so that we may assume that each atom of a substance con tains at least one corpuscle From the size and the charge on the corpuscle both of which are known we find that each cor 266 SCIENCEAUGUST 27 1909 puscle has 8 X 107 ergs of energy this is on the supposition that the usual expres sions for the energy of a charged body hold when as in the case of a corpuscle the charge is reduced to one unit Now in one gram of hydrogen there are about 6 X 1028 atoms so if there is only one corpuscle in each atom the energy due to the corpuscles in a gram of hydrogen would be 48 Xl101 ergs or 11 X 109 calories This is more than seven times the heat developed by one gram of radium or than that developed by the burning of five tons of coal Thus we see that even ordinary matter contains enormous stores of energy this energy is fortunately kept fast bound by the cor puscles if at any time an appreciable fraction were to get free the earth would explode and become a gaseous nebula The matter of which I have been speak ing so far is the material which builds up the earth the sun and the stars the matter studied by the chemist and which he can represent by a formula this matter occu pies however but an insignificant fraction of the universe it forms but minute islands in the great ocean of the ether the sub stance with which the whole universe is filled The ether is not a fantastic creation of the speculative philosopher it is as essen tial to us as the air we breathe For we must remember that we on this earth are not living on our own resources we are de pendent from minute to minute upon what we are getting from the sun and the gifts of the sun are conveyed to us by the ether It is to the sun that we owe not merely night and day springtime and harvest but it is the energy of the sun stored up in coal in waterfalls in food that practically does all the work of the world How great is the supply the sun lavishes upon us becomes clear when we consider that the heat received by the earth under a high sun and a clear sky is equivalent ac cording to the measurements of Langley to about 7000 horsepower per acre Though our engineers have not yet discovered how to utilize this enormous supply of power they will I have not the slightest doubt ultimately succeed in doing so and when coal is exhausted and our waterpower in adequate it may be that this is the source from which we shall derive the energy nec essary for the worlds work When that comes about our centers of industrial ac tivity may perhaps be transferred to the burning deserts of the Sahara and the value of land determited by its suitability for the reception of traps to catch sun beams This energy in the interval between its departure from the sun and its arrival at the earth must be in the space between them Thus this space must contain some thing which like ordinary matter can store up energy which can carry at an enormous pate the energy associated with light and heat and which can in addition exert the enormous stresses necessary to keep the earth circling round the sun and the moon round the earth The study of this allpervading substance is perhaps the most fascinating and impor tant duty of the physicist On the electromagnetic theory of light now universally accepted the energy streaming to the earth travels through the ether in electric waves thus practically the whole of the energy at our disposal has at one time or another been electrical energy The ether must then be the seat of elec trical and magnetic forces We know thanks to the genius of Clerk Maxwell the founder and inspirer of modern electrical theory the equations which express the re lation between these forces and although for some purposes these are all we require yet they do not tell us very much about the nature of the ether SCIENCE 267N S VOL XXX No 765 The interest inspired by equations too in some minds is apt to be somewhat Pla tonic and something more grossly mechan icala model for example is felt by many to be more suggestive and manageable and for them a more powerful instrument of research than a purely analytical theory Is the ether dense or rare Has it a structure Is it at rest or in motion are some of the questions which force them selves upon us Let us consider some of the facts known about the ether When light falls on a body and is absorbed by it the body is pushed forward in the direction in which the light is traveling and if the body is free to move it is set in motion by the light Now it is a fundamental principle of dy namics that when a body is set moving in a certain direction or to use the language of dynamics acquires momentum in that di rection some other mass must lose the same amount of momentum in other words the amount of momentum in the universe is constant Thus when the body is pushed forward by the light some other system must have lost the momentum the body ac quires and the only other system available is the wave of light falling on the body hence we conclude that there must have been momentum in the wave in the direc tion in which it is traveling Momentum however implies mass in motion We con elude then that in the ether through which the wave is moving there is mass moving with the velocity of light The experiments made on the pressure due to light enable us to calculate this mass and we find that in a cubic kilometer of ether carrying light as intense as sunlight is at the surface of the earth the mass moving is only about one fiftymillionth of a milligram We must be careful not to confuse this with the mass of a cubic kilometer of ether it is only the mass moved when the light passes through it the vast majority of the ether is left undisturbed by the light Now on the electromagnetic theory of light a wave of light may be regarded as made up of groups of lines of electric force moving with the velocity of light and if we take this point of view we can prove that the mass of ether per cubic centimeter carried along is pro portional to the energy possessed by these lines of electric force per cubic centimeter divided by the square of the velocity of light But though lines of electric force carry some of the ether along with them as they move the amount so carried even in the strongest electric fields we can produce is but a minute fraction of the ether in their neighborhood This is proved by an experiment made by Sir Oliver Lodge in which light was made to travel through an electric field in rapid motion If the electric field had carried the whole of the ether with it the velocity of the light would have been in creased by the velocity of the electric field As a matter of fact no increase whatever could be detected though it would have been registered if it had amounted to one thousandth part of that of the field The ether carried along by a wave of light must be an exceedingly small part of the volume through which the wave is spread Parts of this volume are in mo tion but by far the greater part is at rest thus in the wave front there can not be uniformity at some parts the ether is moving at others it is at restin other words the wave front must be more analo gous to bright specks on a dark ground than to a uniformly illuminated surface The place where the density of the ether carried along by an electric field rises to its highest value is close to a corpuscle for round the corpuscles are by far the strong est electric fields of which we have any knowledge We know the mass of the cor puscle we know from Kaufmanns experi 268 SCIENCEAUGUST 27 1909 ments that this arises entirely from the electric charge and is therefore due to the ether carried along with the corpuscle by the lines of force attached to it A simple calculation shows that one half of this mass is contained in a volume seven times that of a corpuscle Since we know the volume of the corpuscle as well as the mass we can calculate the density of the ether attached to the corpuscle doing so we find it amounts to the prodigious value of about 5 X 1010 or about 2000 million times that of lead Sir Oliver Lodge by somewhat different considerations has ar rived at a value of the same order of mag nitude Thus around the corpuscle ether must have an extravagant density whether the density is as great as this in other places depends upon whether the ether is com pressible or not If it is compressible then it may be condensed round the cor puscles and there have an abnormally great density if it is not compressible then the density in free space can not be less than the number I have just mentioned With respect to this point we must re member that the forces acting on the ether close to the corpuscle are prodigious If the ether were for example an ideal gas whose density increased in proportion to the pressure however great the pressure might be then if when exposed to the pressures which exist in some directions close to the corpuscle it had the density stated above its density under atmospheric pressure would only be about 8 X 1016 or a cubic kilometer would have a mass less than a gram so that instead of being al most incomparably denser than lead it would be almost incomparably rarer than the lightest gas I do not know at present of any effect which would enable us to determine whether ether is compressible or not And although at first sight the idea that we are immersed in a medium almost infinitely denser than lead might seem inconceivable it is not so if we remember that in all probability matter is composed mainly of holes We may in fact regard matter as possessing a birdcage kind of structure in which the volume of the ether disturbed by the wires when the structure is moved is infinitesimal in comparison with the vol ume enclosed by them If we do this no difficulty arises from the great density of the ether all we have to do is to increase the distance between the wires in propor tion as we increase the density of the ether Let us now consider how much ether is carried along by ordinary matter and what effects this might be expected to produce The simplest electrical system we know an electrified sphere has attached to it a mass of ether proportional to its potential energy and such that if the mass were to move with the velocity of light its kinetic energy would equal the electrostatic poten tial energy of the particle This result can be extended to any electrified system and it can be shown that such a system binds a mass of the ether proportional to its poten tial energy Thus a part of the mass of any system is proportional to the potential energy of the system The question now arises Does this part of the mass add anything to the weight of the body If the ether were not subject to gravitational attraction it certainly would not and even if the ether were ponderable we might expect that as the mass is swim ming in a sea of ether it would not increaseo the weight of the body to which it is at tached But if it does not then a body with a large amount of potential energy may have an appreciable amount of its mass in a form which does not increase its weight and thus the weight of a given mass of it may be less than that of an equal mass of SCIENCE 269SCIENCE some substance with a smaller amount of potential energy Thus the weights of equal masses of these substances would be different Now experiments with pendu lums as Newton pointed out enable us to determine with great accuracy the weights of equal masses of different substances Newton himself made experiments of this kind and found that the weights of equal masses were the same for all the materials he tried Bessel in 1830 made some ex periments on this subject which are still the most accurate we possess and he showed that the weights of equal masses of lead silver iron brass did not differ by as much as one part in 60000 The substances tried by Newton and Bessel did not however include any of those substances which possess the marvel lous power of radioactivity the discovery of these came much later and is one of the most striking achievements of modern physics These radioactive substances are con stantly giving out large quantities of heat presumably at the expense of their poten tial energy thus when these substances reach their final nonradioactive state their potential energy must be less than when they were radioactive Professor Ruther ford s measurements show that the energy emitted by one gram of radium in the course of its degradation to nonradioactive forms is equal to the kinetic energy of a mass of one thirteenth of a milligram moving with the velocity of light This energy according to the rule I have stated corresponds to a mass of one thir teenth of a milligram of the ether and thus a gram of radium in its radioactive state must have at least one thirteenth of a milli gram more of ether attached to it than when it has been degraded into the non radioactive forms Thus if this ether does not increase the weight of the radium the ratio of mass to weight for radium would be greater by about one part in 13000 than for its nonradioactive products I attempted several years ago to find the ratio of mass to weight for radium by swinging a little pendulum the bob of which was made of radium I had only a small quantity of radium and was not therefore able to attain any great accu racy I found that the difference if any in the ratio of the mass to weight between radium and other substances was not more than one part in 2000 Lately we have been using at the Cavendish Laboratory a pendulum whose bob was filled with uran ium oxide We have got good reasons for supposing that uranium is a parent of radium so that the great potential energy and large ethereal mass possessed by the radium will be also in the uranium the experiments are not yet completed It is perhaps expecting almost too much to hope that the radioactive substances may add to the great services they have already done to science by furnishing the first case in which there is some differentiation in the action of gravity The mass of ether bound by any system is such that if it were to move with the velocity of light its kinetic energy would be equal to the potential energy of the system This result suggests a new view of the nature of potential energy Poten tial energy is usually regarded as essen tially different from kinetic energy Po tential energy depends on the configuration of the system and can be calculated from it when we have the requisite data kinetic energy on the other hand depends upon the velocity of the system According to the principle of the conservation of energy the one form can be converted into the other at a fixed rate of exchange so that when one unit of one kind disappears a unit of the other simultaneously appears 270 N S VoL XXX No 765AUGUST 27 1909 Now in many cases this rule is all that we require to calculate the behavior of the system and the conception of potential energy is of the utmost value in making the knowledge derived from experiment and observation available for mathematical cal culation It must however I think be admitted that from the purely philosoph ical point of view it is open to serious ob jection It violates for example the prin ciple of continuity When a thing changes from a state A to a different state B the principle of continuity requires that it must pass through a number of states inter mediate between A and B so that the transition is made gradually and not ab ruptly Now when kinetic energy changes into potential although there is no discon tinuity in the quantity of the energy there is in its quality for we do not recognize any kind of energy intermediate between that due to the motion and that due to the position of the system and some portions of energy are supposed to change per sal turn from the kinetic to the potential form In the case of the transition of kinetic en ergy into heat energy in a gas the discon tinuity has disappeared with a fuller knowledge of what the heat energy in a gas is due to When we were ignorant of the nature of this energy the transition from kinetic into thermal energy seemed discontinuous but now we know that this energy is the kinetic energy of the mole cules of which the gas is composed so that there is no change in the type of energy when the kinetic energy of visible motion is transformed into the thermal energy of a gasit is just the transference of kinetic energy from one body to another If we regard potential energy as the kinetic energy of portions of the ether at tached to the system then all energy is kinetic energy due to the motion of matter or of portions of ether attached to the mat ter I showed many years ago in my Applications of Dynamics to Physics and Chemistry that we could imitate the ef fects of the potential energy of a system by means of the kinetic energy of invisible systems connected in an appropriate man ner with the main system and that the potential energy of the visible universe may in reality be the kinetic energy of an invisible one connected up with it We naturally suppose that this invisible uni verse is the luminiferous ether that por tions of the ether in rapid motion are con nected with the visible systems and that their kinetic energy is the potential energy of the systems We may thus regard the ether as a bank in which we may deposit energy and with draw it at our convenience The mass of the ether attached to the system will change as the potential energy changes and thus the mass of a system whose potential en ergy is changing can not be constant the fluctuations in mass under ordinary condi tions are however so small that they can not be detected by any means at present at our disposal Inasmuch as the various forms of potential energy are continually being changed into heat energy which is the kinetic energy of the molecules of mat ter there is a constant tendency for the mass of a system such as the earth or the sun to diminish and thus as time goes on for the mass of ether gripped by the ma terial universe to become smaller and smaller the rate at which it would dim inish would however get slower as time went on and there is no reason to think that it would ever get below a very large value Radiation of light and heat from an in candescent body like the sun involves a con stant loss of mass by the body Each unit of energy radiated carries off its quota of mass but as the mass ejected from the sun SCIENCE 271N S VoL XXX No 765 per year is only one part in 20 billionths 1 in 2 X 1013 of the mass of the sun and as this diminution in mass is not neces sarily accompanied by any decrease in its gravitational attraction we can not expect to be able to get any evidence of this effect As our knowledge of the properties of light has progressed we have been driven to recognize that the ether when transmit ting light possesses properties which be fore the introduction of the electromag netic theory would have been thought to be peculiar to an emission theory of light and to be fatal to the theory that light con sists of undulations Take for example the pressure exerted by light This would follow as a matter of course if we supposed light to be small particles moving with great velocities for these if they struck against a body would manifestly tend to push it forward while on the undulatory theory there seemed no reason why any effect of this kind should take place Indeed in 1792 this very point was re garded as a test between the theories and Bennet made experiments to see whether or not he could find any traces of this pres sure We now know that the pressure is there and if Bennets instrument had been more sensitive he must have observed it It is perhaps fortunate that Bennet had not at his command more delicate appa ratus Had he discovered the pressure of light it would have shaken confidence in the undulatory theory and checked that magnificent work at the beginning of the last century which so greatly increased our knowledge of optics As another example take the question of the distribution of energy in a wave of light On the emission theory the energy in the light is the kinetic energy of the light particles Thus the energy of light is made up of distinct units the unit being the energy of one of the particles The idea that the energy has a structure of this kind has lately received a good deal of support Planck in a very remarkable series of investigations on the thermody namics of radiation pointed out that the expressions for the energy and entropy of radiant energy were of such a form as to suggest that the energy of radiation like that of a gas on the molecular theory was made up of distinct units the magnitude of the unit depending on the color of the light and on this assumption he was able to calculate the value of the unit and from this deduce incidentally the value of Avo gadros constantthe number of molecules in a cubic centimeter of gas at standard temperature and pressure This result is most interesting and im portant because if it were a legitimate de duction from the second law of thermody namics it would appear that only a par ticular type of mechanism for the vibrators which give out light and the absorbers which absorb it could be in accordance with that law If this were so then regarding the uni verse as a collection of machines all obey ing the laws of dynamics the second law of thermodynamics would only be true for a particular kind of machine There seems however grave objection to this view which I may illustrate by the case of the first law of thermodynamics the principle of the conservation of energy This must be true whatever be the nature of the machines which make up the uni verse provided they obey the laws of dy namics any application of the principle of the conservation of energy could not discriminate between one type of machine and another Now the second law of thermodynamics though not a dynamical principle in as 272 SCIENCEAUGUST 27 1909 strict a sense as the law of the conservation of energy is one that we should expect to hold for a collection of a large number of machines of any type provided that we could not directly affect the individual machines but could only observe the av erage effects produced by an enormous number of them On this view the second law as well as the first should be incapable of saying that the machines were of any particular type so that investigations founded on thermodynamics though the expressions they lead to may suggestcan not I think be regarded as provingthe unit structure of light energy It would seem as if in the application of thermodynamics to radiation some addi tional assumption has been implicitly in troduced for these applications lead to definite relations between the energy of the light of any particular wavelength and the temperature of the luminous body Now a possible way of accounting for the light emitted by hot bodies is to suppose that it arises from the collisions of cor puscles with the molecules of the hot body but it is only for one particular law of force between the corpuscles and the mole cules that the distribution of energy would be the same as that deduced by the second law of thermodynamics so that in this case as in the other the results obtained by the application of thermodynamics to radia tion would require us to suppose that the second law of thermodynamics is only true for radiation when the radiation is pro duced by mechanism of a special type Quite apart however from considera tions of thermodynamics we should expect that the light from a luminous source should iii many cases consist of parcels possessing at any rate to begin with a definite amount of energy Consider for example the case of a gas like sodium vapor emitting light of a definite wave length we may imagine that this light consisting of electrical waves is emitted by systems resembling Leyden jars The en ergy originally possessed by such a system will be the electrostatic energy of the charged jar When the vibrations are started this energy will be radiated away into space the radiation forming a com plex system containing if the jar has no electrical resistance the energy stored up in the jar The amount of this energy will depend on the size of the jar and the quantity of electricity with which it is charged With regard to the charge we must remember that we are dealing with systems formed out of single molecules so that the charge will only consist of one or two natural units of electricity or at all events some small multiple of that unit while for geo metrically similar Leyden jars the energy for a given charge will be proportional to the frequency of the vibration thus the energy in the bundle of radiation will be proportional to the frequency of the vibra tion We may picture to ourselves the radia tion as consisting of the lines of electric force which before the vibrations were started were held bound by the charges on the jar and which when the vibrations begin are thrown into rhythmic undula tions liberated from the jar and travel through space with the velocity of light Now let us suppose that this system strikes against an uncharged condenser and gives it a charge of electricity the charge on the plates of the condenser must be at least one unit of electricity because frac tions of this charge do not exist and each unit charge will anchor a unit tube of force which must come from the parcel of radiation falling upon it Thus a tube in the incident light will be anchored by the condenser and the parcel formed by SCIENCE 273N S VOL XXX No 765 this tube will be anchored and withdrawn as a whole from the pencil of light incident on the condenser If the energy required to charge up the condenser with a unit of electricity is greater than the energy in the incident parcel the tube will not be an chored and the light will pass over the condenser and escape from it These prin ciples that radiation is made up of units and that it requires a unit possessing a definite amount of energy to excite radia tion in a body on which it falls perhaps receive their best illustration in the re markable laws governing secondary Ront gen radiation recently discovered by Pro fessor Barkla Professor Barkla has found that each of the different chemical ele ments when exposed to RSntgen rays emit a definite type of secondary radiation what ever may have been the type of primary thus lead emits one type copper another and so on but these radiations are not excited at all if the primary radiation is of a softer type than the specific radiation emitted by the substance thus the sec ondary radiation from lead being harder than that from copper if copper is ex posed to the secondary radiation from lead the copper will radiate but lead will not radiate when exposed to copper Thus if we suppose that the energy in a unit of hard RIntgen rays is greater than that in one of soft Barklas results are strikingly analogous to those which would follow on the unit theory of light Though we have I think strong reasons for thinking that the energy in the light waves of definite wavelength is done up into bundles and that these bundles when emitted all possess the same amount of energy I do not think there is any reason for supposing that in any casual specimen of light of this wavelength which may subsequent to its emission have been many times refracted or reflected the bundles pos sess any definite amount of energy For consider what must happen when a bundle is incident on a suface such as glass when part of it is reflected and part transmitted The bundle is divided into two portions in each of which the energy is less than the incident bundle and since these portions diverge and may ultimately be many thou sands of miles apart it would seem mean ingless to still regard them as forming one unit Thus the energy in the bundles of light after they have suffered partial re flection will not be the same as in the bundles when they were emitted The study of the dimensions of these bundles for example the angle they subtend at the luminous source is an interesting subject for investigation experiments on inter ference between rays of light emerging in different directions from the luminous source would probably throw light on this point I now pass to a very brief consideration of one of the most important and interest ing advances ever made in physics and in which Canada as the place of the labors of Professors Rutherford and Soddy has taken a conspicuous part I mean the dis eovery and investigation of radioactivity Radioactivity was brought to light by the Rontgen rays One of the many remark able properties of these rays is to excite phosphorescence in certain substances in cluding the salts of uranium when they fall upon them Since Rontgen rays produce phosphorescence it occurred to 3ecquerel to try whether phosphores cence would produce Rontgen rays He took some uranium salts which had been made to phosphoresce by exposure not to Rontgen rays but to sunlight tested them and found that they gave out rays possess ing properties similar to R6ntgen rays Further investigation showed however that to get these rays it was not necessary SCIENCE 274AUGUST 27 1909 to make the uranium phosphoresce that the salts were just as active if they had been kept in the dark It thus appeared that the property was due to the metal and not to the phosphorescence and that uranium and its compounds possessed the power of giving out rays which like R6ntgen rays affect a photographic plate make certain minerals phosphoresce and make gases through which they pass conductors of electricity Niepce de SaintVictor had observed some years before this discovery that paper soaked in a solution of uranium nitrate affected a photographic plate but the ob servation excited but little interest The ground had not then been prepared by the discovery of the Rintgen rays for its re ception and it withered and was soon for gotten Shortly after Becquerels discovery of uranium Schmidt found that thorium possessed similar properties Then Mon sieur and Madame Curie after a most diffi cult and laborious investigation discov ered two new substances radium and polonium possessing this property to an enormously greater extent than either thorium or uranium and this was followed by the discovery of actinium by Debierne Now the researches of Rutherford and others have led to the discovery of so many new radioactive substances that any at tempt at christening seems to have been abandoned and they are denoted like po licemen by the letters of the alphabet Mr Campbell has recently found that potassium though far inferior in this re spect to any of the substances I have named emits an appreciable amount of radiation the amount depending only on the quantity of potassium and being the same whatever the source from which the potassium is obtained or whatever the ele ments with which it may be in combination The radiation emitted by these substances is of three types known as a 3 and y rays The a rays have been shown by Rutherford to be positively electrified atoms of helium moving with speeds which reach up to about one tenth of the velocity of light The 3 rays are negatively electrified cor puscles moving in some cases with very nearly the velocity of light itself while the y rays are unelectrified and are analogous to the Rontgen rays The radioactivity of uranium was shown by Crookes to arise from something mixed with the uranium and which differed suf ficiently in properties from the uranium itself to enable it to be separated by chem ical analysis He took some uranium and by chemical treatment separated it into two portions one of which was radioactive and the other not Next Becquerel found that if these two portions were kept for several months the part which was not radioactive to begin with regained radioactivity while the part which was radioactive to begin with had lost its radioactivity These effects and many others receive a complete explana tion by the theory of radioactive change which we owe to Rutherford and Soddy According to this theory the radioactive elements are not permanent but are grad ually breaking up into elements of lower atomic weight uranium for example is slowly breaking up one of the products be ing radium while radium breaks up into a radioactive gas called radium emanation the emanation into another radioactive sub stance and so on and that the radiations are a kind of swans song emitted by the atoms when they pass from one form to another that for example it is when a radium atom breaks up and an atom of the emanation appears that the rays which con stitute the radioactivity are produced Thus on this view the atoms of the radio SCIENCE 275N S VOL XXX No 765 active elements are not immortal they per ish after a life whose average value ranges from thousands of millions of years in the case of uranium to a second or so in the case of the gaseous emanation from ac tinium When the atoms pass from one state to another they give out large stores of energy thus their descendants do not in herit the whole of their wealth of storedup energy the estate becomes less and less wealthy with each generation we find in fact that the politician when he imposes death duties is but imitating a process which has been going on for ages in the case of these radioactive substances Many points of interest arise when we consider the rate at which the atoms of radioactive substances disappear Ruther ford has shown that whatever be the age of these atoms the percentage of atoms which disappear in one second is always the same another way of putting it is that the ex pectation of life of an atom is independent of its agethat an atom of radium one thousand years old is just as likely to live for another thousand years as one just sprung into existence Now this would be the case if the death of the atom were due to something from outside which struck old and young indis criminately in a battle for example the chance of being shot is the same for old and young so that we are inclined at first to look to something coming from outside as the cause why an atom of radium for ex ample suddenly changes into an atom of the emanation But here we are met with the difficulty that no changes in the external conditions that we have as yet been able to produce have had any effect on the life of th e atom as far as we know at present the life of a radium atom is the same at the temper ature of a furnace as at that of liquid air it is not altered by surrounding the radium by thick screens of lead or other dense ma terials to ward off radiation from outside and what to my mind is especially signifi cant it is the same when the radium is in the most concentrated form when its atoms are exposed to the vigorous bombardment from the rays given off by the neighboring atoms as when it is in the most dilute so lution when the rays are absorbed by the water which separates one atom from another This last result seems to me to make it somewhat improbable that we shall be able to split up the atoms of the non radioactive elements by exposing them to the radiation from radium if this radia tion is unable to affect the unstable radio active atoms it is somewhat unlikely that it will be able to affect the much more stable nonradioactive elements The evidence we have at present is against a disturbance coming from outside breaking up of the radioactive atoms and we must therefore look to some process of decay in the atom itself but if this is the case how are we to reconcile it with the fact that the expectation of life of an atom does not diminish as the atom gets older We can do this if we suppose that the atoms when they are first produced have not all the same strength of constitu tion that some are more robust than others perhaps because they contain more intrin sic energy to begin with and will therefore have a longer life Now if when the atoms are first produced there are some which will live for one year some for ten some for a thousand and so on and if lives of all durations from nothing to infinity are present in such proportion that the num ber of atoms which will live longer than a certain number of years decrease in a con stant proportion for each additional year of life we can easily prove that the expec tation of life of an atom will be the same whatever its age may be On this view the 276 SCIENCEAUGUST 27 1909 different atoms of a radioactive substance are not in all respects identical The energy developed by radioactive sub stances is exceedingly large one gram of radium developing nearly as much energy as would be produced by burning a ton of coal This energy is mainly in the a par ticles the positively charged helium atoms which are emitted when the change in the atom takes place if this energy were pro duced by electrical forces it would indicate that the helium atom had moved through a potential difference of about two million volts on its way out of the atom of radium The source of this energy is a problem of the deepest interest if it arises from the repulsion of similarly electrified systems exerting forces varying inversely as the square of the distance then to get the requi site amount of energy the systems if their charges were comparable with the charge on the a particle could not when they start be further apart than the radius of a cor puscle 1013 cm If we suppose that the particles do not acquire this energy at the explosion but that before they are shot out of the radium atom they move in circles in side this atom with the speed with which they emerge the forces required to preyent particles moving with this velocity from flying off at a tangent are so great that finite charges of electricity could only pro duce them at distances comparable with the radius of a corpuscle One method by which the requisite amount of energy could be obtained is sug gested by the view to which I have already alludedthat in the atom we have electri fied systems of very different types one small the other large the radius of one type is comparable with 1013 cm that of the other is about 100000 times greater The electrostatic potential energy in the smaller bodies is enormously greater than that in the larger ones if one of these small bodies were to explode and expand to the size of the larger ones we should have a liberation of energy large enough to en dow an a particle with the energy it pos sesses Is it possible that the positive units of electricity were to begin with quite as small as the negative but while in the course of ages most of these have passed from the smaller stage to the larger there are some small ones still lingering in radio active substances and it is the explosion of these which liberates the energy set free during radioactive transformation The properties of radium have conse quences of enormous importance to the geologist as well as to the physicist or chem ist In fact the discovery of these proper ties has entirely altered the aspect of one of the most interesting geological problems that of the age of the earth Before the discovery of radium it was supposed that the supplies of heat furnished by chemical changes going on in the earth were quite insignificant and that there was nothing to replace the heat which flows from the hot interior of the earth to the colder crust Now when the earth first solidified it only possessed a certain amount of capital in the form of heat and if it is continually spend ing this capital and not gaining any fresh heat it is evident that the process can not have been going on for more than a certain number of years otherwise the earth would be colder than it is Lord Kelvin in this way estimated the age of the earth to be less than 100 million years Though the quantity of radium in the earth is an ex ceedingly small fraction of the mass of the earth only amounting according to the de terminations of Professors Strutt and Joly to about five grams in a cube whose side is 100 miles yet the amount of heat given out by this small quantity of radium is so great that it is more than enough to replace the heat which flows from the inside to the SCIENCE 277N S VOL XXX No 765 outside of the earth This as Rutherford has pointed out entirely vitiates the previ ous method of determining the age of the earth The fact is that the radium gives out so much heat that we do not quite know what to do with it for if there was as much radium throughout the interior of the earth as there is in its crust the temperature of the earth would increase much more rap idly than it does as we descend below the earth s surface Professor Strutt has shown that if radium behaves in the in terior of the earth as it does at the surface rocks similar to those in the earths crust can not extend to a depth of more than fortyfive miles below the surface It is remarkable that Professor Milne from the study of earthquake phenomena had previously come to the conclusion that rocks similar to those at the earths surface only descend a short distance below the surface he estimates this distance at about thirty miles and concludes that at a depth greater than this the earth is fairly homogeneous Though the discovery of radioactivity has taken away one method of calculating the age of the earth it has supplied another The gas helium is given out by radio active bodies and since except in beryls it is not found in minerals which do not contain radioactive elements it is probable that all the helium in these minerals has come from these elements In the case of a mineral containing uranium the parent of radium in radioactive equilibrium with radium and its products helium will be produced at a definite rate Helium how ever unlike the radioactive elements is permanent and accumulates in the min eral hence if we measure the amount of helium in a sample of rock and the amount produced by the sample in one year we can find the length of time the helium has been accumulating and hence the age of the rock This method which is due to Pro fessor Strutt may lead to determiinations not merely of the average age of the crust of the earth but of the ages of particular rocks and the date at which the various strata were deposited he has for example shown in this way that a specimen of the mineral thorianite must be more than 240 million years old The physiological and medical properties of the rays emitted by radium is a field of research in which enough has already been done to justify the hope that it may lead to considerable alleviation of human suffer ing It seems quite definitely established that for some diseases notably rodent ulcer treatment with these rays has pro duced remarkable cures it is imperative lest we should be passing over a means of saving life and health that the subject should be investigated in a much more sys tematic and extensive manner than there has yet been either time or material for Radium is however so costly that few hospitals could afford to undertake pion eering work of this kind fortunately how ever through the generosity of Sir Ernest Cassel and Lord Iveagh a Radium Insti tute under the patronage of his Majesty the King has been founded in London for the study of the medical properties of radium and for the treatment of patients suffering from diseases for which radiumn is beneficial The new discoveries made in physics in the last few years and the ideas and poten tialities suggested by them have had an effect upon the workers in that subject akin to that produced in literature by the Renaissance Enthusiasm has been quick ened and there is a hopeful youthful per haps exuberant spirit abroad which leads men to make with confidence experiments which would have been thought fantastic twenty years ago It has quite dispelled 278 SCIENCEAUIGUST 27 1909 the pessimistic feeling not uncommon at that time that all the interesting things had been discovered and all that was left was to alter a decimal or two in some phys ical constant There never was any justi fication for this feeling there never were any signs of an approach to finality in science The sum of knowledge is at pres ent at any rate a diverging not a converg ing series As we conquer peak after peak we see in front of us regions full of in terest and beauty but we do not see our goal we do not see the horizon in the dis tance tower still higher peaks which will yield to those who ascend them still wider prospects and deepen the feeling whose truth is emphasized by every advance in science that Great are the Works of the Lord J J THOMSON ROBERT EDWVARDS CARTER STEARNS DR ROBERT EDWARDS CARTER STEARNS died at Los Angeles Cal July 27 in his

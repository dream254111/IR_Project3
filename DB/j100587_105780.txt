Robertson Lib R S THE great advantages arising from the use of Arthmetic particularly in philosophy and commerce is sufficiently known therefore every step taken towards its perfec tion has always been countenanced by those who were best acquainted with its nature and value On these motives I have been induced to offer the annexed paper to this learned Society Read Nov 24 1768 Regiomontanus it is said first among Europeans added to the then known arthmetic an operation by decimal fractions which he exemplified in his triangular table Its utility was readily seen and embraced in many nations and particularly in this where it appears to have been cultivated in its theory and facile modes of operation more than in other places Many writers have remarked its excellency in nu meral computation and have pointed out compen diums to avoid the trouble of writing down super fluous figures particularly in the operations with concrete numbers or those relative to money weight and measure where the gradations from one deno mination to another do not proceed in an uniform progression In finding the decimal values of the fractional parts of concrete and other numbers it often hap D d 2 pens208 pens that those decimals do not terminate or end with a few figures only and sometimes are infinite or never end and among these are many which have one or more figures constantly recurring as in the following proportions viz 3 2 10000 c 06666 c and 12 5 10000 c 04166 c also 7 3 10000 c 0428571428571 c In operations with such recurring decimal frac tions particularly in multiplication and division the work will either be longer than necessary or be very inaccurate if the numbers are not considered as cir culating ones and to come at the true results of such operations several authors have given precise rules and some of them have shewn the principles upon which those rules were founded In the annexed paper those principles are en deavoured to be exhibited in a different and in a more general and concise manner than has hitherto been shewn but the modes of working are not here annexed as they are to be found in Cunn Malcolm Marsh and others and may hereafter be fully ex emplified in a treatise of Arithmetic by the author hereof considered in a more mathematical order than what has hitherto been appropriated to this most useful science G E N E R A L P R I N C I P L E S 1 Number is supposed to begin at unity and from thence to ascend and descend those terms ascending above unity are integers and those descending be low unity are fractions When209 When in the ascending and descending parts of the scale the gradation proceeds by a tenfold value from the right hand towards the left the rank of numbers thus generated is called the decimal scale As every place in this scale is ten times the value of its next right hand place therefore the first place in thefractional part is 11 0 of the place of units and the second third fourth c descending places in the fractional part is 11 0 0 11 0 0 0 11 0 0 0 0 c part of the place of units Therefore every decimal fraction is equal to a series arising from m ulti plying the first second third fourth c terms of the decreasing geome trical progression 11 0  11 0 0  11 0 0 0  11 0 0 0 0 c by the first second third and fourth c terms in the given fraction respectively Thus Let the given fraction be 03587 or 3 5 8 71 0 0 0 0 Then 0358711 0 X 3  11 0 0 X 5  11 0 0 0 X 8  11 0 0 0 0 X 7  31 0  51 0 0  81 0 0 0  71 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 01 0 0 0 0  5 0 01 0 0 0 0  8 01 0 0 0 0  71 0 0 0 0  3 5 8 71 0 0 0 0 2 Every decimal fraction arises from division when the dividend is less than the divisor For divisor dividend 10 first term of the fraction  100 sum of the first and second terms  1000 sum of the first second and third terms c And according to the ratio of the divisor to the dividend the quotient or decimal fraction will be finite or infinite 3 Among those decimal fractions which are infinite or do not end some of them recur or circulate that is the same figure or figures run over again and again ad infinitum As 0333 c 02323 c 0758758 c 0999 c Here 0333 c 31 0  31 0 0  31 0 0 0  31 0 0 0 0 c 02323 c 21 0  31 0 0  21 0 0 0  31 0 0 0 0 c 0785785 c 71 0  81 0 0  51 0 0 0  71 0 0 0 0  81 0 0 0 0 0  51 0 0 0 0 0 0 c 0999 c 91 0  91 0 0  91 0 0 0  91 0 0 0 0 c V O L LVIII E e The210 The circulating fraction 0999 c is equal to 10 For the difference between 10 and 0999 c is less than can be assigned To save a repetition of figures it is usual to mark the first and last of circulating expressions with points over the figures Thus 0333 c is wrote 03 02323 c 023 0785785 c 0785 4 Like circulating decimal fractions are those which have each the same number of circulating places and begin to recur each at the same name Every finite decimal fraction may be considered as infinite cyphers being used as the circulating part Either place of a circulating expression may be taken as the first observ ing that the number and order of the circulating places be not altered For as the decimal fraction arises by division if either place of the re curring figures be taken for the first the others will from thence re gularly circulate Hence several unlike circulating decimal fractions may be made to begin and end at places of like names 5 If in the decimal scale 10 100 1000 10000 100000 1000000 c continued indefinitely be selected any rank of equidistant terms such that whatever term therein is taken for the first term and the first term is made the common ratio to the rest then will the sum of the reciprocals of those terms be equal to the reciprocal of the number which is unity less than the first term Thus 110  1100  11000  c  19 10 being the 1 st term 1100  110000  11000000  c  199 100 being the 1 st term 11000  11000000  11000000000  c  1999 1000 being the 1 st term For211 For 110  1100  11000  c  100  10  11000  111 c1000 c 1100  11000  11000000  c  10000  100  1000000  10101 c1000000 c 11000  11000000  11000000000  c  1000000  1000  11000000000  10010011000000000 c But 111 c  9  1000 c by 3d Then 111 c1000 c  19 10101 c  99  100000 c Then 10101 c1000000 c  199 1001001 c  999  1000000000 c Then 1001001 c1000000000 c  1999 Hence the reciprocal of a number consisting of n places of 9s is equal to a circulating number of n places the right hand figure being 1 and the rest 0s Thus 19  111 c1000 c  0 1 199  10101 c1000000 c  001 1999  1001001 c1000000000 c  0001 19999  10001001 c1000000000000 c  00001 6 If the reciprocal of a number consisting of n places of 9s be multi plied by a number D not exceeding n places the product will be a cir culating decimal fraction of n places the right hand ones being the same digits as are in the number D Let D  3 or D  23 or D  785 or to any other number E e 2 Now212 Now 19  111 c1000 c 199  10101 c1000000 c 1999  1001001 c1000000000 c by 5th Therefore 19 or 111 c1000 c  3  333 c1000 c  03  3  30303 c1000000 c  003 199 or 10101 c1000000 c  23  232323 c1000000 c  023  3  3003003 c1000000000 c  0003 1999 or 1001001 c1000000000 c  23  23023023 c1000000000 c  0023  785  785785785 c1000000000 c  0785 7 Hence every circulating decimal fraction will be equivalent to a vulgar fraction wherein the numerator is those circulating figures and the denomi nator consists of as many 9s as are figures in the numerator Thus 03  39 For 19  3  39  03 by 6th 003  399 199  3  399  003 023  2399 199  23  2399  023 8 Hence a circulating decimal fraction of any number of places being multiplied by a number of as many 9s will give a finite expression having the same figures as are in the circulating one Thus 06  9  6 For 9 1 6 06 006  99  6 99 1 6 006 025  99  25 99 1 25 025 0625  999  625 999 1 625 0625 Hence213 Hence it appears that in common multiplication the product of a cir culating number by its proper denominator in 9s will be deficient of the true product by that circulating number Thus 06  9  54 then 54 6  6 For 69  06 006  99  594 then 594  006  6 For 699  006 0625  999  624375 then 624375  0625  6250 Hence Any finite number is in proportion to the same number re curring as the proper denominator of the circulate is to that denomina tor increased by unity Thus 9 10 6 6 For 6  9  6  10 99 100 25 25 For 25  99  25  100 S C H O L I U M If to the preceding articles be joined the compendiums of multiplying and dividing by any number of 9s they will constitute the whole of the theory upon which depend all the operations with circulating numbers for as these have 9s for their denominator wanting unity in the lowest place to make them 10s therefore unity for every 9 is applied in some additions and multiplications Or the circulating parts being reduced to finite number then working with them by the common rules will give finite results which results are to be reduced to circulates by contrary operations to what were used to reduce the circulates to finites XXXIII A

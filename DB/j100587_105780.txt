J100587,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16831775,105780,OF THE THEORY OF CIRCULATING DECIMAL FRACTIONS BY JOHN ROBERTSON LIB R S,I206923,207 XXXII OF THE THEORY OF CIRCULATING DE CIMAL FRACTIONS BY JOHN ROBERTSON LIB R S THE GREAT ADVANTAGES ARISING FROM THE USE OF ARTHMETIC PARTICULARLY IN PHILOSOPHY AND COMMERCE IS SUFFICIENTLY KNOWN THEREFORE EVERY STEP TAKEN TOWARDS ITS PERFEC TION HAS ALWAYS BEEN COUNTENANCED BY THOSE WHO WERE BEST ACQUAINTED WITH ITS NATURE AND VALUE ON THESE MOTIVES I HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO OFFER THE ANNEXED PAPER TO THIS LEARNED SOCIETY READ NOV 24 1768 REGIOMONTANUS IT IS SAID FIRST AMONG EUROPEANS ADDED TO THE THEN KNOWN ARTHMETIC AN OPERATION BY DECIMAL FRACTIONS WHICH HE EXEMPLIFIED IN HIS TRIANGULAR TABLE ITS UTILITY WAS READILY SEEN AND EMBRACED IN MANY NATIONS AND PARTICULARLY IN THIS WHERE IT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN CULTIVATED IN ITS THEORY AND FACILE MODES OF OPERATION MORE THAN IN OTHER PLACES MANY WRITERS HAVE REMARKED ITS EXCELLENCY IN NU MERAL COMPUTATION AND HAVE POINTED OUT COMPEN DIUMS TO AVOID THE TROUBLE OF WRITING DOWN SUPER FLUOUS FIGURES PARTICULARLY IN THE OPERATIONS WITH CONCRETE NUMBERS OR THOSE RELATIVE TO MONEY WEIGHT AND MEASURE WHERE THE GRADATIONS FROM ONE DENO MINATION TO ANOTHER DO NOT PROCEED IN AN UNIFORM PROGRESSION IN FINDING THE DECIMAL VALUES OF THE FRACTIONAL PARTS OF CONCRETE AND OTHER NUMBERS IT OFTEN HAP D D 2 PENS208 PENS THAT THOSE DECIMALS DO NOT TERMINATE OR END WITH A FEW FIGURES ONLY AND SOMETIMES ARE INFINITE OR NEVER END AND AMONG THESE ARE MANY WHICH HAVE ONE OR MORE FIGURES CONSTANTLY RECURRING AS IN THE FOLLOWING PROPORTIONS VIZ 3 2 10000 C 06666 C AND 12 5 10000 C 04166 C ALSO 7 3 10000 C 0428571428571 C IN OPERATIONS WITH SUCH RECURRING DECIMAL FRAC TIONS PARTICULARLY IN MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION THE WORK WILL EITHER BE LONGER THAN NECESSARY OR BE VERY INACCURATE IF THE NUMBERS ARE NOT CONSIDERED AS CIR CULATING ONES AND TO COME AT THE TRUE RESULTS OF SUCH OPERATIONS SEVERAL AUTHORS HAVE GIVEN PRECISE RULES AND SOME OF THEM HAVE SHEWN THE PRINCIPLES UPON WHICH THOSE RULES WERE FOUNDED IN THE ANNEXED PAPER THOSE PRINCIPLES ARE EN DEAVOURED TO BE EXHIBITED IN A DIFFERENT AND IN A MORE GENERAL AND CONCISE MANNER THAN HAS HITHERTO BEEN SHEWN BUT THE MODES OF WORKING ARE NOT HERE ANNEXED AS THEY ARE TO BE FOUND IN CUNN MALCOLM MARSH AND OTHERS AND MAY HEREAFTER BE FULLY EX EMPLIFIED IN A TREATISE OF ARITHMETIC BY THE AUTHOR HEREOF CONSIDERED IN A MORE MATHEMATICAL ORDER THAN WHAT HAS HITHERTO BEEN APPROPRIATED TO THIS MOST USEFUL SCIENCE G

THE DECIMAL SCALE AS EVERY PLACE IN THIS SCALE IS TEN TIMES THE VALUE OF ITS NEXT RIGHT HAND PLACE THEREFORE THE FIRST PLACE IN THEFRACTIONAL PART IS 11 0 OF THE PLACE OF UNITS AND THE SECOND THIRD

COMPENDIUMS OF MULTIPLYING AND DIVIDING BY ANY NUMBER OF 9S THEY WILL CONSTITUTE THE WHOLE OF THE THEORY UPON WHICH DEPEND ALL THE OPERATIONS WITH CIRCULATING NUMBERS FOR AS THESE HAVE 9S FOR THEIR DENOMINATOR WANTING UNITY IN THE LOWEST PLACE TO MAKE THEM 10S THEREFORE UNITY FOR EVERY 9 IS APPLIED IN SOME ADDITIONS AND MULTIPLICATIONS OR THE CIRCULATING PARTS BEING REDUCED TO FINITE NUMBER THEN WORKING WITH THEM BY THE COMMON RULES WILL GIVE FINITE RESULTS WHICH RESULTS ARE TO BE REDUCED TO CIRCULATES BY CONTRARY OPERATIONS TO WHAT WERE USED TO REDUCE THE CIRCULATES TO FINITES XXXIII A

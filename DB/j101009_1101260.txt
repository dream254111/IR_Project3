WILL GIVE ORIGIN TO THE REBUTTABLE LEGAL PRESUMPTION OF A GRANT EVEN THOUGH THE USE IN ITS INCEPTION WAS A TRES PASS596 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER DEC BUT IT WAS NOT MEANT BY THIS THAT THE LEGAL PRESUMPTION OF A GRANT COULD BE REBUTTED OR OVERCOME BY PROOF THAT THE OWNER OF THE FEETHE SERVIENT ESTATE HAD NO ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE CLAIM TO AN EASEMENT AND DID NOT EXPRESSLY ACQUIESCE IN THE DOMINANT USE IT WAS ONLY INTENDED THAT THE PRESUMPTION COULD BE REBUTTED BY SHOWING THAT THE USE WAS BY EXPRESS PERMISSION OR THAT THE OWNER OF THE SERVIENT ESTATE WAS UNDER A LEGAL DISABILITY AND COULD NOT THEREFORE GIVE CONSENT OR LEGAL ACQUIESCENCE OR IN OTHER WORDS BY THE INTER POSITION OF ANY OF THE EXCUSATORY PLEAS THAT ARE OPEN TO A PLAINTIFF IN EJECTMENT AGAINST A PLEA BY THE DEFENDANT OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS SO THAT ALTHOUGH TECHNICALLY THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS DOES NOT APPLY TO AN EASEMENT STILL BY JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION THE RESULT IS THE SAME AS IF THE STATUTE DID SO APPLY UNDER THE FIRST CONTENTION THE PLAINTIFF ASSERTS THE SUBCONTENTION THAT THE BURDEN IS UPON THE DEFENDANT TO SHOW THAT SUCH EXERCISE OF SUCH AN EASEMENT WAS WITH THE KNOWLEDGE AND ACQUIESEENCE OF THE OWNER AND THAT IN THIS CASE SO FAR FROM THE DEFENDANT SO PROVING IT APPEARS THAT MARY E BOYCE DID NOT KNOW THAT THE TRACKS WERE ON THE LAND UNTIL 1890 AND JOHN OFALLON DELANEY DID NOT KNOW THAT FACT UNTIL 1895 THEORETICALLY THE USE AND EASEMENT ARE WITH THE KNOWL EDGE AND ACQUIESCENCE OF THE OWNER AS MUCH AS IS THE ADVERSE POSSESSION OF A DEFENDANT IN EJECTMENT FOR THE LAW PRESUMES THAT EVERY MAN KNOWS THE CON DITION AND STATUS OF HIS LAND AND IF ANYONE OUSTS HIM OR TRESPASSES UPON HIS LAND OR ENTERS INTO POSSESSION AND SETS UP AN ADVERSE CLAIM THERETO AND THE OWNER DOES NOT ASK LEGAL AID TO DISPOSSESS HIM WITHIN THE TIME LIMITED FOR BRING ING SUCH ACTIONS THE LAW ASSUMES THAT THE OWNER HAS ACQUIESCED IN THE ADVERSE CLAIM THAT IS THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS SETS AT REST ALL SUCH QUESTIONS UNLESS THEY ARE PROPERLY PRESENTED FOR ADJUDICATION WITHIN THE STATUTORY PERIOD OF LIMITATION IN POINT OF FACT THE OWNER LIKE THESE OWNERS MAY HAVE HAD NO ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE AND THEREFORE DID NOT EXPRESSLY ACQUIESCE BUT THE LAW IM PLIES KNOWLEDGE AND THEREFORE CONSENT THIS IS AS TRUE OF CLAIMS TO EASEMENTS AS IT IS TO CLAIMS TO THE LAND ITSELF 10 AM  ENG ENC LAW P 426

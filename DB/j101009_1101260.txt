permanently laid on land without condemnation proceedings or contract with or license from the owner and so remained and was used for the purposes of the road for the statutory period all the elements of adverse possession existing Held that such possession by the road like an original and tortious possession by an individual ripens into title by limitation whether the true owner actually saw or knew of the possession or not Boyce v Mo Pac B Co Mo 68 S W 9201902 NOTES OF CASES 595 The opinion by Marshall J contains a review of the authorities pertinent to the theory adopted by the couirtthat of a lost grant The court says in part  Originally in England easements were said to lie wholly in grant Ease ments are incorporeal hereditaments and statutes of limitations were held to apply only to actions for the recovery of land Afterwards the fiction of a lost grant was adopted by the courts that is the courts presumed from the long possession and exercise of right by the defendant with the acquiescence of the owner that there must have been originally a grant by the owner to the claim ant which had become lost It was called a  lost grant not to indicate that the fact of the existence of the grant originally was of importance but to avoid the rule of pleading requiring profert Railroad Co v McFarlan 43 N J Law 605 It was considered the duty of the couirt to enforce the fiction not however because either the court or the jury believe the presumed grant to have been actually made but because public policy and convenience require that longcontinued possession shall not be disturbed Jones Easem sec 161 p 138 Pollock B in the recent case of Bass v Gregory 25 Q B Div 481 decided in 1890 said the fiction of lost grant has been adopted by almost all civilized nations for the furtherance of justice and the sake of peace Formerly it was held to apply only to cases where the defendant claimed a right to posses sion by prescription that is that his right began at a period beyond the  time whereof the memory of man runneth not to the contrary Lately in England and in most of the United States the rule has been adopted that the period for acquiring an easement in lands corresponds to the local statute of limitations as to land For it was said It would be irrational to hold that an easement may not be acquired by the same lapse of time required to confer title to the land by adverse possession Jones Easem sec 160 p 134 and cases cited in notes And this is the doctrine ably announced by Ellison J speaking for the Kansas City court of appeals in Houwe v Montgomery 19 Mo App loc cit 179 after an exhaustive review of the modern authori ties Hence while statutc of limitations do not directly apply to actions in which easements or other incorporeal hereditaments are involved still by judicial construction an adverse user of an easement for the period specified in the statute barring a2tions fcr the recoveryv if jaaad is no v by aalogy held to be a conclusive judicial presumption of a preseriptive right bv a lost grant Jones Easem sees 161 162 and cases cited 10 Ara  Eng Enc Law 2d Ed p 426 and cases cited It is the accepted rule however that the user toperfect title by prescriptionto an easement must be exercised by the owner of the dominant tenement and must be open peaceable continuous and as of right Illinois Cent R Co v City of Bloomington 167

Harris 162 Pa 397 29 Atl 874 This doctrine was recognized by this court in Pitzman v Boyce 111 Mo 387 19 S W 1104 33 Am St Rep 536 and it was there said And such adverse user for the statutory period will give origin to the rebuttable legal presumption of a grant even though the use in its inception was a tres pass596 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Dec But it was not meant by this that the legal presumption of a grant could be rebutted or overcome by proof that the owner of the feethe servient estate had no actual knowledge of the claim to an easement and did not expressly acquiesce in the dominant use It was only intended that the presumption could be rebutted by showing that the use was by express permission or that the owner of the servient estate was under a legal disability and could not therefore give consent or legal acquiescence or in other words by the inter position of any of the excusatory pleas that are open to a plaintiff in ejectment against a plea by the defendant of the statute of limitations So that although technically the statute of limitations does not apply to an easement still by judicial interpretation the result is the same as if the statute did so apply Under the first contention the plaintiff asserts the subcontention that the burden is upon the defendant to show that such exercise of such an easement was with the knowledge and acquieseence of the owner and that in this case so far from the defendant so proving it appears that Mary E Boyce did not know that the tracks were on the land until 1890 and John OFallon Delaney did not know that fact until 1895 Theoretically the use and easement are with the knowl edge and acquiescence of the owner as much as is the adverse possession of a defendant in ejectment For the law presumes that every man knows the con dition and status of his land and if anyone ousts him or trespasses upon his land or enters into possession and sets up an adverse claim thereto and the owner does not ask legal aid to dispossess him within the time limited for bring ing such actions the law assumes that the owner has acquiesced in the adverse claim That is the statute of limitations sets at rest all such questions unless they are properly presented for adjudication within the statutory period of limitation In point of fact the owner like these owners may have had no actual knowledge and therefore did not expressly acquiesce but the law im plies knowledge and therefore consent This is as true of claims to easements as it is to claims to the land itself 10 Am  Eng Enc Law p 426

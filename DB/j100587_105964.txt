J100587,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16831775,105964,AN ATTEMPT TO DETERMINE THE HEIGHT OF THE SUNS ATMOSPHERE FROM THE HEIGHT OF THE SOLAR SPOTS ABOVE THE SUNS SURFACE IN A LETTER TO MR J ELLICOT F R S FROM THE REV MR HORSELEY F R S,I206922,398 XXXVIII AN ATTEMPT TO DETERMINE THE HEIGHT OF THE SUNS ATMOSPHERE FROM THE HEIGHT OF THE SOLAR SPOTS ABOVE THE SUNS SURFACE IN A LETTER TO MR J ELLICOT F R S FROM THE REV MR HORSELEY F R S I RETURN YOU MANY THANKS FOR YOUR OBLIGING COMMUNICATION OF THE OBSER VATIONS OF THE LATE TRANSIT OF VENUS BY MAYER AND ROHLIUS THE PHAENOMENA WHICH THEY RELATE OF THE ATMOSPHERE OF THAT PLANET ARE HIGHLY CURIOUS THEY WERE PERHAPS THE MORE INTERESTING TO ME AS THEY CONFIRMED SOME CONJECTURES OF MY OWN CONCERNING THE GREAT HEIGHT OF THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE SUN AND OF THOSE OF THE TWO NEARER PLANETS I ONCE ATTEMPTED TO MAKE A ROUGH COMPARISON BETWEEN THE HEIGHT OF THE SUNS ATMOSPHERE AND THAT OF OUR OWN BY COM PARING THE HEIGHT OF THE SOLAR SPOTS ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE SUN WITH THAT OF OUR CLOUDS ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH WHICH I DID IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER READ JULY 9 1767 THE INCLINATION OF THE SUNS EQUATOR TO THE PLACE OF THE EARTHS ORBIT IS SO SMALL THAT IN THIS ENQUIRY I THINK IT MAY SAFELY BE NEGLECTED AND I CONSIDER THE TWO PLANES AS ONE LET T BE THE CENTER OF THE EARTH S THAT OF THE SUN JOIN T S AND LET DEFBE A GREAT CIRCLE OF THE SUNS SPHERE FORMED BY THE INTERSECTOR OF THE PLANE OF THE EARTHS ORBIT WITH THE SUNS SUR 1 FACE399 FACE LET A B C BE THE CIRCLE DESCRIBED BY THE REVO LUTION OF A SPOT FROM T DRAW TF AND TD TOUCH H F C B S E T A G D ING THE CIRCLE DE F IN F AND D AND CUTTING A B C IN C AND A JOIN D F THROUGH S DRAW H S G PARALLEL TO DF JOIN S C S A S D THE SPOTS ARE HID BE HIND THE SUN THREE DAYS LONGER THAN THEY ARE VISIBLE THAT IS THEY ARE HID 15 DAYS AND ARE SEEN ONLY 12 THE EARTHS MOTION IN 15 DAY IS 14 17 THE SPOTS TRAVERSE THE LIKE AREA IN 1 D 0 H 50 NEARLY HENCE IF THE EARTH STOOD STILL THE SPOTS WOULD BE HID ONLY 13D 23 H 10 AND THEIR WHOLE SIDEREAL PERIOD BEING 25 D 5 H THEY WOULD BE VISIBLE 11 D 5 H 50 AND THE TIME OF THEIR OCCULATION WOULD EXCEED THE TIME OF THEIR APPEARANCE BY 2 D 17H 20 HENCE THE ARC A C IS LESS THAN THE ARC A B C BY THE MOTION OF 2 D 17 H 20 THAT IS BY 38 52 56 AND THE SEMICIRCLE BEING A MEAN ARITHMETIC BETWEEN A C AND A B C A C WILL BE LESS THAN THE SEMICIRCLE BY HALF AS MUCH THAT IS BY 19 26 28 HENCE EACH OF THE ANGLES G S A H S C IS 9 43 14 THE ANGLE B S D  D T S  16 1 27 THEREFORE D S A IS 9 27 12 HENCE S A  1 013767 SUCH PARTS AS S D IS 1 THE400 THE DISTANCE THEREFORE OF THESE SPOTS FROM THE CENTER OF THE SUN IS 1 013767 SEMIDIAMETERS OF THE SUN AND THEIR DISTANCE FROM HIS SURFACE IS IN IN DE CIMAL PARTS OF HIS SEMIDIAMETER013767 HENCE IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE HEIGHT OF THE SOLAR SPOTS ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE SUN IS ABOVE 54 SUCH PARTS AS BEAR EACH TO THE SUNS SEMIDIAMETER THE PROPORTION OF ONE PARIS MILE TO THE SEMIDIAMETER OF THE EARTH WHICH IS THAT OF 1 TO 3923 NEARLY THE HEIGHT OF OUR ATMOSPHERE IS GENERALLY RECKONED ABOUT 50 MILES THAT OF THE LIGHTEST CLOUDS FALL SHORT OF ONE MILE THE WHOLE HEIGHT OF OUR ATMOSPHERE THERE FORE IS AT LEAST 50 TIMES THAT OF OUR HIGHEST CLOUDS IF THE WHOLE HEIGHT OF THE SUNS ATMOSPHERE BEAR AS LARGE A PROPORTION TO THE HEIGHT OF THESE SOLAR SPOTS OR CLOUDS AND I THINK THE PROPORTION IS LIKELY TO BE MUCH LARGER THE HEIGHT OF THE SUNS ATMO SPHERE IS NOT LESS IN PROPORTION TO HIS SEMIDIAMETER THAN 54 TIMES THAT OF THE EARTHS AND EXCEEDS TWO THIRDS OF HIS SEMIDIAMETER BEING IN DECIMAL PARTS THEREOF68835 THE PROBABILITY SEEMS TO BE THAT THE HEIGHT OF THE SUNS ATMOSPHERE IS ALMOST DOUBLE OF THIS FOR I QUESTION WHETHER THE MEAN HEIGHT OF OUR CLOUDS EXCEEDS 12 A PARIS MILE THE SOLAR SPOTS THEREFORE ARE 108 TIMES AS HIGH IN PROPORTION AND THEN SUPPOSING AS BEFORE THAT THE WHOLE HEIGHT OF THE SUNS ATMOSPHERE BEARS THE SAME PROPORTION TO THE HEIGHT OF HIS SPOTS AS THE WHOLE HEIGHT OF OUR AT MOSPHERE TO THE MEAN HEIGHT OF OUR CLOUDS THE SUNS ATMOSPHERE WILL BE 108 TIMES AS HIGH IN PRO PORTION TO HIS SEMIDIAMETER AS OURS IS AND WILL RISE 7 TO401 TO THE DISTANCE OF MORE THAN 43 OF HIS SEMIDIAMETER FROM HIS SURFACE LET PHILOSOPHERS CONSIDER WHETHER THESE INDICA TIONS OF THE VAST HEIGHT OF THE SUNS ATMOSPHERE GIVE ANY DEGREE OF PROBABILITY TO A CONJECTURE OF SIR ISAAC NEWTONS THAT THE DISSIPATION OF THE SUNS SUBSTANCE WHICH MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO ENSUE FROM HIS INTENSE HEAT MAY IN GREAT PART BE PREVENTED BY THE PRODIGIOUS PRESSURE OF THE INCUMBENT ATMO SPHERE THE HEIGHT OF THE ATMOSPHERE OF VENUS IS CON SIDERABLY GREATER ACCORDING TO THE OBSERVATIONS OF MAYER AND ROHLIUS THAN THEY IMAGINED ROHLIUS FOLLOWS CASSINI IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE SUNS APOGEE SEMIDIAMETER WHICH CASSINI OVER RATED BY 3 45 THIS QUANTITY THEREFORE IS TO BE ADDED TO THE HEIGHT OF VENUSS ATMOSPHERE 155 AS STATED BY ROHLIUS WHICH MAKES THE TRUE HEIGHT 1925 THAT IS ABOVE 13 OF THE DIAMETER OF THE PLANET I CANNOT BUT RE FLECT WITH SOME DEGREE OF NATIONAL TRIUMPH ON THE GREAT PART THAT OUR OWN COUNTRY MAY JUSTLY CLAIM IN MANY OF THE MOST CURIOUS DISCOVERIES IN ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD MR MEYER GENEROUSLY CONFESSES HOW MUCH HE STOOD INDEBTED TO ENGLISH ARTISTS YOU TOLD ME THAT IT IS YOUR INTENTION TO PRESENT THAT CURIOUS TRACT TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY YOU MAY LIKEWISE COM MUNICATE THIS IF YOU THINK IT CONTAINS ANY THING WOR THY OF THEIR NOTICE I AM SIR WITH GREAT ESTEEM YOUR MOST OBEDIENT AND MOST HUMBLE SERVANT BROADSTREET JUNE 11 1767 SAM HORSLEY V O L LVII F F F XXXIX

PHILOSOPHY AND ASTRONOMY IN KINGS COLLEGE COMMUNICATED BY THOMAS BELL ESQ FRS RECEIVED JUNE 14READ JUNE 21 1838 THE SURFACE OF ANY TURBINATED OR DISCOID SHELL MAY BE IMAGINED TO BE GENERATED BY THE REVOLUTION ABOUT A FIXED AXIS THE AXIS OF THE SHELL OF THE PERIMETER OF A GEOME TRICAL FIGURE WHICH REMAINING ALWAYS GEOMETRICALLY SIMILAR TO ITSELF INCREASES CONTI NUALLY ITS DIMENSIONS IN DISCOID SHELLS THE GENERATING FIGURE RETAINS ITS POSITION UPON THE AXIS AS IT THUS REVOLVES AS IN THE NAUTILUS POMPILIUS PLATE IX FIG 3 AND THE ARGONAUT IN TURBINATED SHELLS INCLUDING THE GREAT FAMILIES OF TROCHI TURBINES MURICES AND STROMBI IT SLIDES CONTINUALLY ALONG THE AXIS OF ITS REVOLUTION FIG 4 IN SOME GREAT CLASSES OF SHELLS AS THE AMMONITES THE NAUTILUS SCROBICULATUS THE NAUTILUS SPIRULA THE HELIX CORNEA THE TROCHUS PERSPECTIVUS THE NERITA THE GENERATING FIGURE INCREASES ITS DISTANCE FROM THE AXIS AT THE SAME TIME THAT IT INCREASES ITS DIMENSIONS AND RE VOLVES AMONG THE GENERATING FIGURES OF CONCHLOIDAL SURFACES ARE TO BE FOUND VARIOUS KNOWN GEOMETRICAL FORMS THE GENERATING FIGURE OF THE CONUS VIRGO IS A TRIANGLE THAT OF THE TROCHUS TELESCOPICUS AND OF THE TROCHUS ARCHIMEDIS A TRAPEZOID THE SPECIES OF THE GENUS TURBO HAVE FOR THEIR GENERATING FIGURE A CURVE OF DOUBLE CURVATURE OF A CIRCULAR OR ELLIPTIC FORM TO WHOSE PERIMETER THE AXIS OF REVOLUTION IS A TANGENT THE NAUTILAS POMPILIUS IS GENERATED BY THE REVOLUTION ABOUT ITS SHORTER DIAMETER OF A PLANE CURVE APPROACHING VERY NEARLY TO A SERNIELLIPSE FIG 3  AND THE CYPROEA BY THE RE VOLUTION OF A SIMILAR CURVE ABOUT ITS LONGER DIAMETER THERE IS A MECHANICAL UNIFORMITY OBSERVABLE IN THE DESCRIPTION OF SHELLS OF THE SAME SPECIES WHICH AT ONCE SUGGESTS THE PROBABILITY THAT THE GENERATING FIGURE OF EACH IN CREASES AND THAT THE SPIRAL CHAMBER OF EACH EXPANDS ITSELF ACCORDING TO SOME SIMPLE GEOMETRICAL LAW COMMON TO ALL TO THE DETERMINATION OF THIS LAW IF ANY SUCH EXIST THE OPERCULUM LENDS ITSELF IN CERTAIN CLASSES OF SHELLS WITH REMARKABLE FACILITY CONTI NUALLY ENLARGED BY THE ANIMAL AS THE CONSTMUCTION OF ITS SHELL ADVANCES SO AS TO FILL UP ITS MOUTH THE OPERCULUM MEASURES THE PROGRESSIVE WIDENING OF THE SPIRAL CHAMBER BY THE PROGRESSIVE STAGES OF ITS GROWTH OF THESE PROGRESSIVE STAGES OF THE GROWTH OF THE OPERCULUM DISTINCT TRACES REMAIN  THE BEAUTIFUL SHELL TURBO SCALARIS VENTLETRAP MAY BE TAKEN AS AN EASY ILLUSTRATION OF THE PROPERTIES TO BE DESCRIBED IN THIS PAPER352 THE REV H MOSELEY ON THE GEOMETRICAL FORMS ON ITS SURFACE UNDER THE FORM IN THE TURBINES FIG 1 OF CERTAIN CURVED LINES AND IN THE NERITOE FIG 2 OF CERTAIN STRAIGHT LINES PASSING FROM THE MARGIN OF THE OPER CULUMI WHICH IF PRODUCED THEY WOULD INTERSECT TO A CERTAIN SPIRAL LINE MARKED DEEPLY UPON ITS FACE TO THIS SPIRAL THEY ARE TANGENTS AND MAY BE SUPPOSED TO GENERATE IT BY THEIR CONSECUTIVE INTERSECTIONS THE SPIRAL EVENTUALLY PASSES INTO THE MARGIN OF THE OPERCULURN AND FOR A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE TRACES IT IF THE EYE BE MADE TO TRAVERSE ONE OF THE CURVED LINES FIRST SPOKEN OF IN THE OPER CULUMR OF THE TURBO OR ONE OF THE STRAIGHT LINES IN THE NERITA FROM ITS MARGIN TO THE POINT WHERE IT LOSES ITSELF IN THE SPIRAL AND IF IT THEN FOLLOW THE SPIRAL UNTIL IT RETURNS TO THE POINT IN THE MARGIN WHENCE IT SET OUT IT WILL HAVE TRAVERSED THE BOUNDARY OF A FIGURE WHICH WAS ONCE THE ACTUAL BOUNDARY OF THE OPERCULUM WHICH THEREFORE IN DICATES ONE STAGE OF ITS GROWTH AND OF WHICH ALL SIMILARLY TRACED WILL BE SEEN TO HAVE SIMILAR GEOMETRICAL FORMS IT WILL FURTHER BE APPARENT FROM THIS EXAMINATION THAT THE OPERCULUM HAS INCREASED AT EACH STAGE OF ITS GROWTH NOT THROUGHOUT ITS WHOLE MARGIN AT ONCE BUT ON A SERIES OF DIFFERENT PORTIONS OF IT LYING IN DIFFERENT CONSECUTIVE POSITIONS ROUND IT EACH SUCH ADDITION BEING SO MADE AS TO PRESERVE THE ABOVEMENTIONED GEOMETRICAL SIMILARITY OF THE WHOLE IN ALL THE SIMILAR GEOMETRICAL FIGURES THUS VISIBLE UPON THE FACE OF THE OPERCULUM AND WHICH HAVE IN SUCCESSION CONSTITUTED ITS LIMITS THE POLE OF THE SPIRAL WILL MOREOVER BE SEEN TO OCCUPY A SIMILAR POSITION THE LINEAR DIMENSIONS OF ANY TWO OF THEM P1 C Q1 AND P2 C Q2 ARE THEN TO ONE ANOTHER AS THE RADII VECTORES DRAWN TO SIMILAR POINTS IN THEM AND THEREFORE AS THOSE P P1 AND P P2 DRAWN TO THE EXTREMITIES OF THE BOUNDARY BY WHICH THEY UNITE TO DETERMINE THEREFORE THE LAW ACCORDING TO WHICH THE LINEAR INCREASE OF THE OPER CULUMR TAKES PLACE THAT IS THE LAW ACCORDING TO WHICH THE LINEAR INCREASE OF THE SEC TION OF THE CHAMBER OF THE SHELL TAKES PLACE WE HAVE ONLY TO DETERMINE THE LAW ACCORD ING TO WHICH THE RADII VECTORES DRAWN TO SUCCESSIVE POINTS OF THE SPIRAL VISIBLE UPON THE OPERCULUM INCREASE THAT IS WE HAVE ONLY GEOMETRICALLY TO DETERMINE THE SPIRAL NOW IN EVERY CASE THIS SPIRAL IS THE LOGARITHMIC SPIRAL A SLIGHT INSPECTION OF IT IS SUFFICIENT TO SUGGEST THE PROBABILITY THAT THE ANGLE AT WHICH IT INTERSECTS ITS RADIUS VECTOR IS EVERYWHERE THE SAME AND THIS SUPPOSITION IS FULLY CONFIRMED BY DIRECT ADULEASUREMENTS GROUNDED UPON THE FOLLOWING PROPERTY OF THE LOGARITHMIC SPIRAL THAT THE DISTANCES OF SUCCESSIVE SPIRES MEASURED UPON THE SAME RADIUS VECTOR PRODUCED FROM THE POLE AND FROM ONE ANOTHER ARE RESPECTIVELY IN GEOMETRICAL PROGRESSION THE COMMON RATIO OF THE PROGRESSION BEING IN BOTH CASES 52GRCOTA WHERE A IS THE CONSTANT ANGLE OF THE SPIRAL T THE WHOLE CLASS OF SHELLS HALIOTIS AFFECTS

PROGRESS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE AS THE SUCCESSIVE RADII VECTORES OF ITS SPIRAL THE INCREMENTS OF ITS LINEAR DIMENSIONS ARE THEN AS THE INCREMENTS OF THESE RADII VECTORES BUT BY A FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTY OF THE LOGARITHMIC SPIRAL THE INCREMENTS OF ITS RADII VECTORES CORRESPONDING TO EQUAL INCRE MNENTS IN THEIR ANGLES OF REVOLUTION ARE AS THE RADII VECTORES THEMSELVES THUS THEN IT FOLLOWS THAT THE INCREMENTS OF THE LINEAR DIMENSIONS OF THE OPERCULUM CORRESPOND ING TO EQUAL ANGULAR DISTANCES ROUND ITS POLE ARE AS ITS EXISTING LINEAR DIMENSIONS AND THEREFORE THAT THE INCREMENTS OF THE LINEAR DIMENSIONS OF THE SECTION OF THE SPI RAL CHAMBER CORRESPONDING TO THESE ARE EVERYWHERE AS ITS EXISTING LINEAR DIMENSIONS THE ANIMAL AS HE ADVANCES IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF HIS SHELL INCREASES CONTINUALLY HIS OPERCULUMN SO AS TO ADJUST IT TO ITS MOUTH HE INCREASES IT HOWEVER NOT BY ADDITIONS MADE AT THE SAME TINE ALL ROUND ITS MDCCCXXXVLL 2 Z354 THE REV H MOSELEY ON THE GEOM1ETRICAL FORMS NARGIN BUT BY ADDITIONS MADE ONLY ON ONE SIDE OF IT AT ONCE ONE EDGE OF THE OPER CULURN THUS REMAINS UNALTERED AS IT IS ADVANCED INTO EACH NEW POSITION AND PLACED IN A NEWLY FORMED SECTION OF THE CHAMBER SIMILAR TO THE LAST BUT GREATER THAN IT THAT THE SAME EDGE WHICH FITTED A PORTION OF THE FIRST LESS SECTION SHOULD BE CA PABLE OF ADJUSTMENT SO AS TO FIT A PORTION OF THE NEXT SIMILAR BUT GREATER SECTION SUP POSES A GEOMETRICAL PROVISION IN THE CURVED FORM OF THE CHAMBER OF GREAT APPARENT COMPLICATION AND DIFFICULTY BUT GOD HATH BESTOWED UPON THIS HUMBLE ARCHITECT THE PRACTICAL SKILL OF A LEARNED GEOMETRICIAN AND HE MAKES THIS PROVISION WITH ADMIRABLE PRECISION IN THAT CURVATURE OF THE LOGARITHMIC SPIRAL WHICH LHE GIVES TO THE SECTION OF THE SHELL THIS CURVATURE OBTAINING LIE HAS ONLY TO TURN HIS OPERCULUM SLIGHTLY ROUND IN ITS OWN PLANE AS HE ADVANCES IT INTO EACH NEWLY FORMED PORTION OF HIS CHAMBER TO ADAPT ONE MARGIN OF IT TO A NEW AND LARGER SURFACE AND A DIFFERENT CURVATURE LEAVING THE SPACE TO BE FILLED UP BY INCREASING THE OPERCULUM WHOLLY ON THE OTHER MARGIN RRO NAKE THIS APPARENT LET THE FOLLOWING BE RECEIVED AS A CHARACTERISTIC PROPERTY OF THE LOGARITHMIC SPIRAL THAT LINES ANYWHERE DRAWN FROM ITS POLE INCLINED TO ONE ANOTHER AT THE SAME ANGLE WILL INTERCEPT BETWEEN THEM BRANCHES OF THE CURVE WHICH HOWEVER DIFFERENT THEIR LINEAR DIMENSIONS WILL BE GEOMETRICALLY SIMILAR TO EACH OTHER SO THAT IF TWO LINES GIVEN IN POSITION BE IMAGINED TO BE DRAWN FROM THE POLE OF SUCH A SPIRAL PARALLEL TO ITS PLANE AND THE SPIRAL BE THEN IMAGINED TO BE PUT IN MOTION IN ITS OWN PLANE ROUND ITS POLE THEN AS ITS CURVE REVOLVED UNDER THESE LINES THEY WOULD INTERCEPT PORTIONS OF IT CONTINUALLY INCREASING OR CONTINUALLY DIMINISHING IN DIMEN SIONS AND CONTINUALLY RECEDING FROM OR APPROACHING THE POLE BUT ALL GEOMETRICALLY SIMILARLY TO EACH OTHER ALD SIMILARLY PLACED NOW EACH NEW SECTION OF THE CHAMBER OF THE SHELL BEING SIMILAR TO THE PRECEDING SEC TION BUT GREATER THAN IT IF THE OPERCULLUM WERE THRUST FORWARD INTO THIS GREATER SECTION WITHOUT BEING TURNED ROUND IN ITS OWN PLANE ANY PORTION OF ITS EDGE WOULD MANIFESTLY PRESENT TO THE CORRESPONDING PORTION OF THE PERIMETER OF THE NEW SECTION A SIMILAR BUT A LESS CURVE WHICH COULD NOT BE MADE TO COINCIDE WITH IT IF HOWEVER THE OPERCU LUIN BE IMAGINED TO BE TURNED ROUND IN ITS OWN PLANE ABOUT ITS POLE IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO THAT IN WHICH THE SPIRAL INCREASES THE CURVE PRESENTED BY IT TO THIS POR TION OF THE PERIMETER OF THE SECTION WILL CONTINUALLY APPROACH IT INCREASING ITS DIMEN SIONS BUT REMAINING SIMILAR TO IT SO THAT AT LENGTH IT WILL COINCIDE WITH IT AND THUS ONE MARGIN OF THE OPERCULUM WILL BE MADE EVERYWHERE TO FIT ITSELF TO THE SIDE OF THE CHAMBER THE COINCIDENCE OF THE OTHER MARGIN REMAINING TO BE PRODUCED BY NEW MATTER ADDED TO IT IT WILL BE APPARENT FROM A SIMPLE INSPECTION OF THE OPERCULUMN THAT THE ANIMAL DOES THUS TURN IT ROUND IN ITS OWN PLANE AS HE ADVANCES IT WITH WHAT IS CALLED A SCREW MOTION SUCH IS THE THEORY OF THE GROWTH OF THE OPERCULURN THERE IS TRACED IN IT THE AP PLICATION OF PROPERTIES OF A GEOMETRIC CURVE TO A MECHANICAL PURPOSE BY HIM WHO MUETES THE DIMENSIONS OF SPACE AND STRETCHES OUT THE FORMS OF MATTER ACCORDING TO THEOF TURBINATED AND DISCOID SHELLS 355 RULES OF A PERFECT GEOMETRYPROPERTIES WHICH LIKE SO MANY OTHERS IN NATURE MAY HAVE ALSO THEIR APPLICATION IN ART IT INSTRUCTS US HOW TO SHAPE A TUBE OF A VARIABLE SECTION SO THAT A PISTON DRIVEN ALONG IT SHALL BY ONE SIDE OF ITS MARGIN COINCIDE CONTINUALLY WITH ITS SURFACE AS IT ADVANCES PROVIDED ONLY THE PISTON BE MADE AT THE SAME TIME CONTINUALLY TO REVOLVE IN ITS OWN PLANE THE INVESTIGATION HAS NOW ARRIVED AT A POINT FROM WHICH THE LAW OF THE GEOMETRICAL DESCRIPTION OF TURBINATED SHELLS CAN BE ENUNCIATED WITH GREATER PRECISION THEY ARE GENERATED BY THE REVOLUTION ABOUT A FIXED AXIS THE AXIS OF THE SHELL OF A CURVE WHICH CONTINUALLY VARIES ITS DIMENSIONS ACCORDING TO THE LAW THAT EACH LINEAR INCRE MENT CORRESPONDING TO A GIVEN ANGULAR INCREMENT SHALL VARY AS THE EXISTING DIMEN SIONS OF THE LINE OF WHICH IT IS THE INCREMENT THE LAW OF THE DESCRIPTION OF THE LOGA RITHMIC SPIRAL AND WHICH CURVE EITHER RETAINS ITS POSITION UPON THE AXIS OR MOVES ALONG IT WITH A MOTION OF TRANSLATION IN THE DIRECTION OF ITS LENGTH THIS LAW IS READILY SUBJECTED TO VERIFICATION BY ADMEASUREMNENT IT IS CLEAR THAT IF IT OBTAIN SIMILAR LINEAR DIMENSIONS MEASURED AT SIMILAR POINTS OF SUCCESSIVE WHORLS SHOULD BE IN GEOMETRIC PROGRESSION THUS IF THE GENERATING CURVE AS IN THE NAUTILUS POMPILIUS REVOLVE ABOUT THE AXIS WITHOUT AT THE SAME TIME SLIDING ALONG IT AND A SECTION BE MADE THROUGH THE CENTRE OF THE SHELL PERPENDICULAR TO THE AXIS THEN WILL THE SECTION BE IF THIS LAW BE TRUE A SPIRAL CURVE WHOSE DISTANCES FROMT THE AXIS MEASURED ON THE SAME RADIUS VECTOR ARE IN GEOMETRICAL PROGRESSION AND WHICH IS THEREFORE A LOGARITHMIC SPIRAL IN THE MORE GENERAL CASE IN WHICH THE GENERATING CURVE AS IN THE TURBO SCALARIS SLIDES FORWARDS UPON THE AXIS AS IT REEVOLVES INCREASING AT THE SAMNE TIME ITS LINEAR DI MENSIONS ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF THE LOGARITHMIC SPIRAL IT IS CLEAR THAT THE SURFACES OF THE SUCCESSIVE WHORLS WOULD INTERFERE WITH ONE ANOTHER AND THAT THUS THE UNI FORMNITY OF THE SPIRAL CHAMBER WOULD BE DESTROYED UNLESS THE MOTION OF TRANSLATION OR THE SLIDING MOTION OF THE CURVE BY WHICH THE SPACE ALLOWED TO EACH WHORL UPON THE AXIS IS DETERMINED WERE GOVERNED BY SOME LAW CORRESPONDING TO THAT WHICH GOVERNS THE LINEAR DIMENSIONS OF THE WHORL UNLESS IN SHORT THE SPACES ALLOWED TO THE WIDTLHS OF SUCCESSIVE WHORLS UPON THE AXIS VARIED IN THE SAME PROGRESSION AS THE WIDTHS THEMSELVES VARY A SIMILAR PRINCIPLE APPLIES TO THE DISTANCES OF THE WHORLS MEASURED UPON THE SURFACE OF THE SHELL IN THE SAME PLANE PASSING THROUGH THE AXIS THESE DISTANCES ARE IN FACT IN THIS CASE SIMILAR LINEAR DIMENSIONS OF SUCCESSIVE WHORLS AND ARE THEREFORE SUBJECT ACCORDING TO THE THEORY TO THE LAW OF THE LOGA RITHMIC SPIRAL AND LIKE THE DISTANCES OF SUCCESSIVE WHORLS OF THAT SPIRAL ON THE SAIMLE RADIUS VECTOR ARE IN GEOMETRIC PROGRESSION NAUTILUS POMPILIUS THESE CONCLUSIONS WERE DIRECTLY VERIFIED BY THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS A SHELL OF THE NAUTILUS POMPILIUS WAS CUT THROUGH THE MIDDLE IN A DIRECTION PERPENDICULAR TO ITS AXIS AND A TRACING WAS TAKEN OF THE SECTION OF ITS SPIRAL SURFACE THIS TRACING IS COPIED IN FIG 6 2 Z2356 THE REV H MOSELEY ON THE GEOMETRICAL FORMS IT WAS MADE FROM THE DARK LINE WHICH SHOWS ON THE SECTION OF THE INTERNAL WHORLS OF THE SHELL THE LINE OF THAT PEARLY SURFACE WHICH THE ANIMAL DEPOSITS AS A COVERING TO ITS COMPLETED PORTION AS IT ADVANCES IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF IT IT IS IMPORTANT TO MAKE THIS OBSERVATION BECAUSE AS IT EXTENDS ONE WHORL OF ITS SHELL OVER ANOTHER THE ANIMAL DEPOSITS CONTINUALLY UPON THE PEARLY SURFACE OF THIS LAST A NEW COATING OF SHELL AND THICKENS IT AND IT IS IN THE CENTRE OF THIS THICKENED SECTION THAT IS TO BE FOUND THAT SECTION OF THE PEARLY SURFACE OF WHICH THE EDGE OF THE EXTERNAL WHORL IS A CONTINUATION AND FIONM WHICH THIS TRACING WAS TAKEN IT WILL BE FOUND THAT THE DISTANCE OF ANY TWO OF ITS WHORLS MEASURED UPON A RADIUS VECTOR IS ONETHIRD THAT OF THE TWO NEXT WHORLS MEASURED UPON THE SAME RADIUS VECTOR THUS A B IS ONETHIRD OF B C D E IS ONETHIRD OF EF G H IS ONETHIRD OF H I I K IS ONETHIRD OF I M THE CURVE IS THEREFORE A LOGARITHMIC SPIRAL TURBO DUPLICATUS FROM THE APEX OF A LARGE SPECIMEN OF THE TURBO DUPLICATUS A LINE WAS DRAWN ACROSS ITS WHORLS AND THEIR WIDTHS WERE MEASURED UPON IT IN SUCCESSION BEGINNING FROM THE LAST BUT ONE THE MEASUREMENTS WERE AS BEFORE MADE WITH A FINE PAIR OF COMPASSES AND A DIAGONAL SCALE THE SIGHT WAS ASSISTED BY A MAGNIFYING GLASS IN A

SHELLS OF THE GENERA TROCHUS STROMBUS AND MUREX SOME OF THEM WERE CUT THROUGH THE AXIS LONGITUDINALLY AND SIMILAR MEASUREMENTS WERE MADE BY DRAWING LINES FROM THE APEX ACROSS THE SECTION FROM ALL THESE THE SAME RESULT WAS OBTAINED THUS TO EACH PARTICULAR SPECIES OF SHELL IS ANNEXED A CHARACTERISTIC NUMBER BEING THE RATIO OF THE GEOMETRIC PROGRESSION OF SIMILAR SUCCESSIVE LINEAR DIMENSIONS OF

THIS NUMBER OR THIS ANGLE CONNECTED AS IT IS OF NECESSITY WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE ANIMALS GROWTH AND THE MANNER OF ITS EXISTENCE IS DETERMINABLE BY ACTUAL ADMEASUREINENT AND MAY BE AVAILABLE FOR THE PURPOSES OF CLASSIFICATION IT MAY SUGGEST RELATIONS TO WHICH THE OBSERVATIONS OF NATURALISTS MAY USEFULLY BE DIRECTED AND EVENTUALLY BECOME LINKED WITH CHARACTER ISTIC FORMS AND MODES OF MOLLUSCOUS EXISTENCE  THE WHOLE RACE OF LAND SHELLS FOR INSTANCE WILL CERTAINLY FROM THE NATURE OF THE CASE BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE AQUATIC SHELLS BY A WIDE DIFFERENCE IN THE NUMBERS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE SPECIES OF THE TWO GROUPSOF TURBINATED AND DISCOID SHELLS 39 WHY THE MOLLUSKS WHO INHABIT TURBINATED AND DISCOID SHELLS SHOULD IN THE PIO GRESSIVE INCREASE OF THEIR SPIRAL DWELLINGS AFFECT THE PARTICULAR LAW OF THE LOGARITHMIC SPIRAL IS EASILY TO BE UNDERSTOOD PROVIDENCE HAS SUBJECTED THE INSTINCT WHICH SHAPES OUT EACH TO A RIGID UNIFORMITY OF OPERATION THIS UNIFORMITY MANIFESTS ITSELF IN TURBINATED SHELLS IN RESPECT TO THEIR AXES NOW THE LAW OF THE LOGARITHMIC SPIRAL CONSIDERED UNDER ITS MORE GENERAL FORM OF A CURVE OF DOUBLE CURVATURE IS THE ONLY ONE ACCORDING TO WHICH THE MOLLUSK CAN WIND ITS SPIRAL DWELLING IN AN UNIFORM DIRECTION THROUGH THE SPACE ROUND ITS AXIS IN RESPECT TO THAT AXIS UNDER THIS GENERAL FORM IT MAY BE GEOMETRICALLY DEFINED AS THE CURVE WHOSE TANGENT RETAINS ALWAYS THE SAME ANGULAR POSITION IN RESPECT TO ITS AXIS ANDL IN RESPECT TO A LINE DRAWN FROM THE POINT WHERE IT TOUCHES THE CURVE PERPENDICULAR TO THE AXIS OR IN OTHER WORDS WHICH TRAVERSES THE SPACE ROUND THE AXIS ALWAYS IN THE SAME DIRECTION IN RESPECT TO IT A SECOND PROPERTY OF THE LOGARITHMIC SPIRAL EQUALLY REFERRING ITSELF TO THE UNIFORMITY OF THE ANIMALS OPERATIONS ABOUT THE AXIS OF ITS SHELL IS THIS THAT IT HAS EVERYWHERE THE SAME GEOMETRICAL CURVATURE AND IS THE ONLY CURVE EXCEPT THE CIRCLET WHICH POSSESSES THIS PROPERTY CERTAIN PHYSIOLOGICAL FACTS HAVING REFERENCE TO THE GROWTH OF THE MOLLUSK ARE DE DUCIBLE FROM THE GEOMETRICAL DESCRIPTION OF ITS SHELL IF IT BE A LAND SHELL ITS CAPACITY MAY BE SUPPOSED REASONING FIROM THAT PRINCIPLE OF ECONOMY WHICH IS AN OBSERVABLE LAW IN NATURE TO BE PRECISELY SUFFICIENT FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE ANIMAL WHO BUILT IT IF IT BE AN AQUATIC SHELL IT SERVES THE ANIMAL AT ONCE AS A HABITATION AND AS A FLOAT ENABLING IT TO VARY ITS BUOYANCY ACCORDING AS IT LEAVES A GREATER OR A LESS PORTION OF THE NARROWER EXTREMITY OF ITS CHAMBER UNOCCUPIED AND THUS TO ASCEND OR DESCEND IN THE WATER AT WILL NOW THAT ITS BUOYANCY AND THEREFORE THE FACILITY OF THUS VARYING ITS POSITION MAY REMAIN THE SAME AT EVERY PERIOD OF ITS GROWTH IT IS NECESSARY THAT THE INCREMENT OF THE CAPACITY OF ITS FLOAT SHOULD BEAR A CONSTANT RATIO TO THE CORRESPONDING INCREMENT OF ITS BODY A RATIO WHICH ALWAYS ASSIGNS A GREATER AMOUNT TO THE INCREMENT OF THE CAPACITY OF THE SHELL THAN TO THE CORRESPONDING INCREMENTS OF THE ANIMALS BULLK THUS THE CHAMBER OF THE AQUATIC SHELL IS INCREASED NOT ONLY AS IS THE LAND SHELL SO THAT IT MAY CONTAIN THE GREATER BULK OF THE MOLLUSK BUT SO THAT MORE AND MORE OF IT MAY BE LEFT UNOCCUPIED NOW THE CAPACITY OF THE SHELL AND THE DIMENSIONS OF THE ANIMAL BEGAN TOGETHER AND THEY INCREASE THUS IN A CONSTANT RATIO THE WHOLE BULK OF THE ANIMAL BEARS THEREFORE A CONSTANT RATIO OF GREATER INEQUALITY TO THE WHOLE CAPACITY OF THE SHELL IN AQUATIC SHELLS IN LAND SHELLS IT IS PROBABLY EQUAL TO IT NOW LET THE GENERATING CURVE OF A SHELL BE CONCEIVED TO DESCRIBE AS IT REVOLVES ROUND ITS AXIS A SERIES OF SUCCESSIVE EQUAL ANGLES REPRESENTED EACH BY A 0 CORRE SPONDING TO THESE EQUAL INCREMENTS OF THE ANGLE OF REVOLUTION OF THE GENERATING  SO THAT MOVED PARALLEL TO ITSELF UNTIL IT INTERSECTED THE AXIS IT WOULD ALWAYS INTERSECT IT AT THE SAME ANGLE T THE CIRCLE MAY IN FACT BE CONSIDERED A LOGARITHMIC SPIRAL THE CONSTANT INCLINATION OF WHOSE TANGENT TO ITS RLADIUS VECTOR IS A RIGHT ANGLE OF ALL CURVES THIS SPIRAL CONSIDERED AS THUS INCLUDING THE CIRCLE IS THE SIMPLESTTHE REV HI MOSELEY ON THE GEOMETRICAL FORMS CURIVE WILL BE CERTAIN INCREMENTS OF THE CAPACITY OF THE SHELL AND IT APPEARS FROM THE FOLLOWING MATHEMATICAL INVESTIGATION OF THE PROPERTIES OF CONCHOIDAL SURFACES SEE EQUATION 19 THAT THE INCREMENTS OF THE CAPACITY OF THE SHELL THUS TAKEN WILL BE IN A CONSTANT RATIO TO THE THEN EXISTING WHOLE CAPACITIES OF THE SHELL THE INCREMENT OF THE ANIMALS BULK CORRESPONDING TO EACH OF THESE INCREMENTS OF THE SHELL MUST THEN BE IN A CONSTANT RATIO TO ITS THEN EXISTING HULK  THAT IS THE ANIMALS GROWTH CORRESPOND ING TO A GIVEN INCREMENT A 0 IN THE ANGLE DESCRIBED BY THE GENERATING CURVE OF ILS SHELL IS PROPORTIONAL ALWAYS TO ITS EXISTING GROWTH LET US NOW SUPPOSE THAT THE PHYSICAL LIVING ENERGIES OF THE ANIMAL THOSE BY WHICH IT GROWS AT ANY TIME ARE PROPORTIONAL TO ITS THEN EXISTING GROWTH AND THEREFORE THAT ITS GROWTH IN ANY INCREMENT OF TIME IS PROPORTIONAL TO ITS GROWTH UP TO THAT TIME A SUPPOSITION WHICH POSSESSES AN INDEPENDENT PROBABILITY FROM THE CONCLUSION BE FORE ARRIVED AT AND FROM THIS SUPPOSITION IT FOLLOWS THAT THE GROWTH OF THE ANIMAL CORRESPONDING TO A GIVEN INCREMENT A 0 IN THE AINGLE OF REVOLUTION OF THE GENERATING CURVE AND THE GROWTH CORRESPONDING TO A GIVEN INCREMENT OF TIME ARE EACH PROPOR TIONAL TO THE ANIMALS WHOLE THEN EXISTING GROWTH AND THEREFORE TO ONE ANOTHER AND SINCE THEY BEGIN TOGETHER THAT THE WHOLE ANGLE 0 OF REVOLUTION OF THE GENERATING CURVE OF THE SHELL IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE WHOLE CORRESPONDING TIME OF THE ANIMALS GROWTH AND THEREFORE THAT THE WHOLE NUMBER OF WHORLS AND PARTS OF WHORLS IS PRO PORTIONAL TO ITS WHOLE AGE A CONCLUSION WHICH LIKE THE SUPPOSITION WHENCE IT IS DE DICED POSSESSES AN INDEPENDENT PROBABILITY THE SEPARATE PIOBABILITY OF EACH OF THE TWO SUPPOSITIONS  THAT THE PHYSICAL ENERGIES OF THE MOLLUSK AS DEVELOPED IN ITS GROWTH IN A GIVEN INCREMENT OF TIME ARE PROPOR TIONAL TO ITS WHOLE THEN EXISTING GROWTH AND THAT ITS AGE IS ALWAYS PROPORTIONAL TO THE WHOLE ANGLE WHICH IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE SHELL IT HAS THEN DESCRIBED ROUND ITS AXIS IS GREATLY INCREASED BY THE NECESSARY RELATION WHICH IS HERE SHOWN TO OBTAIN BETWEEN THEM A RELATION BY REASON OF WHICH EITHER SUPPOSITION BEING MADE THE OTHER BECOMES A CONCLUSION THE FORM OF THE MOLLUSK BEING SUPPOSED TO REMAIN GEOMETRICALLY SIMILAR TO ITSELF THE SURFACE OF ITS MANTLE BY WHICH ORGAN IT DEPOSITS ITS SHELL OF NECESSITY VARIES AS THE SQUARE OF ITS LINEAR DIMENSIONS WVHILST THE WHOLE BULK OF THE ANIMAL VARIES AS THE CUBE OF ITS LINEAL DIMENSIONS BUT AS ITS XVHOLE BULK VARIES ITS ACTIVE LIVING AND GROWING ENERGY AND THEREFORE THE AMOUNT OF THE LEPOSITION OF ITS SHELL IN A GIVEN TIME THIS LAST THEN VARIES AS THE CUBE OF ITS LINEAR DIMENSIONS BUT THE SURFACE OF THE DEPOSITING ORGAN THE MANTLE VARIES ONLY AS THE SQUARE OF THE SAME LINEAR DIMEN SIONS BESIDES THEN THE ORGANIC INCREASE OF THE SURFACE OF THE MANTLE THERE MOBUST BE AN INCREASED FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY OF ALL ITS ORGANS VARYING AS ITS SIMPLE LINEAL DI MENSIONS THIS INCREASED FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY OF THE SURFACE OF THE DEPOSITING ORGAN VARYING MAY NOT THIS LAW OF THE GROWTH OF A MOLLUSK HAVE ITS ANALOGY IN OTHER FORMS OF ANIMAL LIFE AND PERHAPS IN VEGETABLE LIFE OF TURBINATED AND DISCOID SHELLS 361 SIMPLY AS THE LINEAR DIMENSIONS OF THE ANIMAL OR ITS SHELL OFFERS AN ANALOGY AND HAS PERHAPS A RELATION TO THE INCREASE OF THE SECTION OF THE SHELL ACCORDING TO THE SAME LAW OF ITS SIMPLE LINEAR DIMENSIONS SUBJOINED TO THIS PAPER IS A MATHEMATICAL DISCUSSION OF THE FOLLOWING GEOMETRICAL AND MECHANICAL ELEMENTS OF A CONCHOIDAL SURFACE ITS VOLUME THE DIMENSIONS OF ITS SURFACE THE CENTRE OF GRAVITY OF ITS CONTAINED SOLID THE CENTRE OF GRAVITY OF ITS SURFACE THESE ELEMENTS ARE DETERMINED THE LAW OF THE LOGARITHMIC SPIRAL BEING SUPPOSED BY CERTAIN TRANSCENDENTAL FUNCTIONS HAVING CONSTANT FACTORS DEPENDENT FOR THEIR AMOUNT UPON THE STATICAL MOMENTS AND THE MOMENTS OF INERTIA OF THE GENERATING FIGURES AND OF THEIR AREAS THE OBJECT PROPOSED IN THE DETERMINATION OF THESE ELEMENTS WAS THEIR APPLICATION TO A DISCUSSION OF THE HYDRAULIC THEORY OF SHELLS YET FURTHER IF POSSIBLE TO DEVELOPE THAT WISDOM OF GOD WHICH SHAPED THEM OUT AND MOULDED THEM AND ESPECIALLY IN REFERENCE TO THE PARTICULAR VALUE OF THE CONSTANT ANGLE WHICH THE SPIRAL OF EACH SPE DIES OF SHELL AFFECTSA VALUE CONNECTED BY A NECESSARY RELATION WITH THE ECONOMY OF THE MATERIAL OF EACH AND WITH ITS STABILITY AND THE CONDITIONS OF ITS BUOYANCY  THE PAPER CONCLUDES WITH A DISCUSSION OF THE GENERAL EQUATIONS TO A CONCHOIDAL SURFACE IN RESPECT TO SYSTEMS OF POLAR AND OF RECTANGULAR COORDINATES TO DETERMINE THE VOLUME OF A CONCHOIDAL SOLID SUPPOSE THE GENERATING CURVE TO BE A PLANE CURVE

THIS REMARK IT MAY HERE BE MENTIONED THAT THE SHELL OF THE NAUTILUS POMPILIUS HAS HY DROSTATICALLY AN ASTATICAL SURFACE IF PLACED WVITH ANY PORTION OF ITS SURFACE UPON THE WATER IT WILL IMME DIATELY TURN OVER TOWARDS ITS SMALLER END AND REST ONLY ON ITS MOUTH THOSE CONVERSANT WITH THE THEORY OF FLOATING BODIES WILL RECOGNISE IN THIS AN INTERESTING PROPERTY MIDCCCXXXVIII 3 A362 THE REV H MOSELEY ON THE GEOMETRICAL FORMS AND THIS IS TRUE FOR ALL VALUES OF  DV D 3M AND V FM D IF WE IMAGINE THE PLANE C Q TO SLIDE ALONG THE AXIS A Z FIG 4 WITHOUT OTHERWISE ALTERING ITS POSITION THE ELEMENTARY SOLID INCLUDED BETWEEN IT AND P C WILL RETAIN THE SAME VOLUME AS IT HAD BEFORE FOR THE TWO PLANES P C AND Q C MAY BE DIVIDED INTO THE SAME NUMBER OF SIMILAR ELEMENTS WHOSE CORRESPONDING ANGLES BEING

higher degrees were offered for work in research the example of the German seminar was naturally the one to be followed Our scholars had studied in Germany and the German methods of teaching including the lecture system were generally adopted in spite of the fact that conditions prevailing in America were different from those in German institutions Although the problem method or the laboratory method of teaching introductory and advanced courses of economics has now practically won the day against the American recitation system as well as against the German lecture system the German type of seminar still obtains in most universities Remem bering that in most courses in German universities the professor supposedly an expert in his special field followed the strict lectureI70 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY method a seminar in which discussion and reports by students were made possible stood out as a signal departure from the lecture method The seminar on one general subject for all students in which discussion and reports were a feature was however nothing more than what would be called an advanced course in our American universities In most if not all depart ments of economics in our large institutions advanced courses are now carried on by discussion and reports which in Germany would be deemed seminars The only true seminar obviously is that in which supervision is given to serious research but when several students work on the same subject it is sometimes the purpose of the instructor thereby to obtain student help in writing one of his own books without much regard to the training of the student A further development appeared in the group seminarnow in common vogue in this countryin which students each carrying on a separate investigation meet together perhaps once a week to listen to the professors criticism The step from advanced courses in which discussion and reports were usual to the group seminar in which each student had chosen a separate subject for research was easy and obvious That step however records no advance over the German method The group seminar has obvious disadvantages If each student has a special topic he is obliged to listen to the report upon a subject foreign to his own in which other methods other sources than his own are used and in which the criticism has little or no bearing upon his own case If he has made any substantial progress in his special research other students will be unable to discuss his position in fact he must in the nature of things have come to know more about it than anyone else At the best the only one from whom he can obtain hints as to treatment methods sources and proportion is his instructor Hence he is an indifferent listener in the group while another is getting criticism and the one not on the grill must feel that his time is illy spent Much as we have been indebted to Germany in the past the development of American universities and American scholarship has brought us to a point where imitation is no longer fruitful and where evolution from our own status is obligatory ConsequentlySEMINAR METHODS OF ECONOMIC INSTRUCTION I7I after some years of experiment with the group seminar it was forced upon my judgment that the individual seminar was the only practicable solution of many difficulties encountered in the group seminar and more than eighteen years of experience with it has confirmed me in this judgment That is the true purpose of the seminar can be gained only by an appointment once a week with each individual student carrying on research Of this it may be said that it is extravagant of time by the instructor That of course is obvious and it is quite foreign to the usual willingness of the German professor to divert his attention from his own scholarship to the training of many advanced students In fact the great amount of time spent in the individual seminar on many studentsand which can be met by perhaps two hours each week in a group seminarwill greatly stimulate the productivity of the student but it will seriously diminish the productivity of the professor It is a choice between the gain of self and the gain of others And no matter how willing no one professor can care for more than about ten or twelve active investigators One must face the facts as to the training and quality of American graduate students A great number of them have awakened late to the possibilities of the higher education and of those who have early known a definite purpose in this direction not all have had good instruction It is surprising to find so many eager students who have been going through the motions but have never been educated The first demand for a serious piece of work on their own initiative in a new field discloses the lack of the fundamental qualities of accuracy capacity to see the central point control of English logical reasoning and a ready command of general economic principles Most commonly the greatest lack is in the power of simple clear orderly exposition In the main this is due to an untrained mind Therefore in my experience an integral part of the work of the teacher must be that of showing the willing overeager hungry but inexperienced student how to educate himself Never having had contact with firstrate instruc tion he has no conception of his deficiencies When put to the test he is usually quick to realize his shortcomings and acquire the humility necessary to the real scholar172 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY It is only too true that few graduate students are properly trained They have read more or less but they do not know anything thoroughly Both the secondary and the college educa tion are at fault We waste at least two years in the period before the student enters college If these two years were fitly used for good training we should hear little of the proposals to shorten the college course in order to get earlier into the professional schools or of the pernicious scheme for counting a year of the college course twice once toward the Bachelors degree and again for the professional degree But even the college course from which our graduate students get their training is still in the meltingpot The college problem has not yet been worked out Few graduate students obtain with the Bachelors degree for instance the ability to read French and German and their grasp and method of work are sadly deficient Of course much of the lack is due to imma turity as well as to poor training although on the other hand many come up for a higher degree at an age when the mind no longer has any capacity to take on flexibility Bearing these practical conditions in mind it is clear that graduate students should get a year or two of a very severe grind in advanced courses before they should be admitted to the seminar Then too one should be willing to give careful consideration to the objective in the seminar What are the ends to be gained  There may be obvious differences of opinion on this point but it can be assumed that there would be agreement on the purpose of stimu lating the mind to individual selfreliance to independence of thinking to impartial weighing of evidence to looking at a subject from different angles to exhaust one topic before leaving it as finished to know the value of firsthand evidence to obtain a high personal standard of achievement and to see the relation of a detailed investigation to the broad field to which it belongs It is one thing to set these aims down on paper but it is quite another thing to enable a student to translate them into practical usage To see that a student actually does apply these aims to some one particular piece of research is in my judgment the objective of the seminar These aims should of course govern work in all advanced courses and if present in all work preliminary to theSEMINAR METHODS OF ECONOMIC INSTRUCTION I73 seminar the student will have an immense advantage in his research work But ordinarily the main part of the task now is to be accomplished in the seminar In my judgment it is not possible to do much toward this end in the group seminar since it is so largely dependent upon getting into close and frequent contact with the mind of each student Whatever the subject chosen by the student for his investigation in the seminar the objective should be the acquisition of methods rather than the acquisition of knowledge Of course no research is worth the name that does not bring forth knowledge and it may seem that new truth is the only real aim But methods are more important than any one set of facts no matter how original because methods once rightly learned become the permanent tools for organizing other series of new and accurate facts Once the student has acquired the experience of applying the proper methods in one investigation he has obtained the most valuable thing he can secure in the seminar In the group seminar in which the worker gets only an occasional personal criticism and that of a general nature supposed to apply also to others and in the main only on completed sections of his task he is left to find out methods for himself after much waste of time and many unnecessary blunders In the individual seminar on the contrary the student although working independently is put to a weekly test of his performances and erroneous methods are immediately corrected A satisfactory thesis subject is generally twosided involving i the accumulation of material and 2 the organization and formulation of the material Not so very long ago in some places untrained students were set to collecting newspaper clippings and material of like sort which wasso to speakchucked into a bag tied up and offered to the world as a Doctors thesis Something more than patient industry is required in a real investigation The power of analysis of establishing relations in fact the organiza tion and formulation of the material is far and away the most serious part of the investigation It is this which more than anything else tests the maturity and capacity of the seminar student In this connection we come upon a matter which is essential to any really valuable production It is what I shouldI74 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY call relative emphasis or a sense of proportion in deciding upon the relative values of various facts or reasonings By the immature or untrained person little discrimination is exercised in separating the large from the small the valuable from the trash the relevant from the irrelevant To him all materials seem about equally important Moreover not until he has grasped his subject in its general relations or seen it as a whole can he pass any serious judgment upon the relative value of any specific fact To see that a student carries out this process in one case is the greatest service an instructor can render It does not seem possible in the group seminar especially if large In the individual seminar proper methods can be explained in general then a specific task is undertaken and a part of it is completed in the best form possible by the student After the most drastic criticism both as to content and exposition it is returned to be rewritten In no other way does the student so completely reveal to the instructor his mental powers and his mental defi ciencies Then it is possible to give advice as to how his short comings may be overcome even if years of watchfulness and care are required Personal suggestion of this sort is rich in result The individual seminar is thus a direct path to productivity Having found himself once by actual performance the student gains selfreliance independence and gives evidence of the power to do equally good things in the future when left entirely to himself Once taught to walk he is taught for the future to use his own power of locomotion To some it might seem that the individual seminar smacked of coddling that the German habit of leaving the student entirely to himself produces a more individual quality and cultivates independence of view To my mind after a long experience the individual seminar rather forces independence and forces it earlier and without waste of time It is not coddling to teach a child to walk by himself he is then more free and more likely to use his own individual force Once the investigator does a thing rightly by himself his competence for the next task is vastly improved The group seminar has its serious advantages but perhaps it appears more satisfactory as a finishingoff place for the studentSEMINAR METHODS OF ECONOMIIC INSTRUCTION I75 who has had the individual seminar When the investigator has run the gauntlet of his instructor and obtained some definite results then it is good for him and for his fellowstudents to lay his performance before the group and stand fire from all possible quarters Graduate students who have had this kind of training find when they go to Germany that the teaching of economics there has not advanced as far as in this country J LAURENCE LAUGHLIN TiiE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO

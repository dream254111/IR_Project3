j101009,The Virginia Law Register,1098515,Back Matter,i245822,940 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER April NOTES BY THE PU1RTTS1H P S THE first volume of the REGISTER ends with this number and with the May issue we begin the publication of the second volume It has been the aim of the Publishers to keep the typographical accuracy and general mechanical appearance of the REGISTER up to a standard in keeping with the merit of its contents That this has been done is attested by the many voluntary letters of approval not only from the legal profession in Virginia who have been liberal in their endorsement but from leading exchanges and publishers in distant parts of the United States The Publishers take this method of returning thanks for the many congratulations and words of encouragement received during the first year of the existence of the VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER and of adding the promise that their efforts will not be relaxed in the least during the coming year Considering that the REGISTER has just rounded out its first year its list of subscribers is large It has received additions constantly from month to month during the year and while the record in this direction is encouraging we know that there are many members of the legal profession in the State who intend to send in their subscriptions but have not yet done so We think the REGISTER is especially entitled to the fill support and encouragement of the bench and bar of Virginia With the enlargement of its subscription list comes a natural increase of its usefulness If you have not subscribed we ask you to think about it seri ously now and if you conclude that the undertaking is worthy to be sustained send in your subscription at once If you are already a subscriber you can materially aid the good cause by suggesting to your neighbor that now is the time to subscribe for the next volume As the REGISTER will be frequently quoted by the courts it will be found con venient for reference to have all the numbers preserved by permanent binding The present number completes the first volume and the title page and index to the whole volume are included with this number that those who wish to do so may have them thus preserved in permanent and easy reference form In the August number the first page of professional cards was by oversight printed on back of page 307 and in the March number some Acts of Assembly were printed on back of page 855 As this would destroy the uniformity in bind ing the numbers pages 307 and 855 as they should appear are inserted in this number so that they can be substituted by the binder The Publishers have a limited supply of each number in the volume and will supply missing numbers at 50 cents each or the whole of the twelve numbers com prising the volume May 1895 to April 1896 inclusive unbound for 500 bound in sheep 600 delivered Subscribers who will send us their numbers paying post or express charges both ways may have them bound in sheep for 100 The Acts of Assembly published in the January February and March num bers should be omitted in binding the REGISTER They were published for tem porary use in advance of the official publication The omission of these will cause several breaks in the paging of the bound volume Printed slips are there fore sent with this number to be inserted at these points by the binder

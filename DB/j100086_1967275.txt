area of which are expressible in rational numbers in particular we shall be chiefly concerned with triangles whose sides and area are expressible in integers The method we shall employ will bring to light new properties of these triangles and at the same time will give a deeper insight into formula and theorems already well known A triangle with integral sides and area we will call an integral triangle and if the three numbers representing the sides have unity for their greatest com mon divisor the triangle will be called a reduced integral triangle We start from the following wellknown theorem THEOREM I Thie sides a b and hypotenuse c of any integral right tri angle satisfy the proportion a b c2a  a2 82 a282 Wiere a  13 are integers a 8  O To prove this we observe that we may write the hypotenuse c equal to b  3a a where 8a is some proper fraction We thus obtain a2b 2 bc22 2abI a 2 a a whence we derive at once b a2M2 a 2a3 Also since co b2 a2la  This proof of the theorem Is to be found in Euler Com Arith Vol i p 2425 The fol lowing more general theorem was proved by Frenicle Traite des triangles rectangles en nom bres Paris 1676   xxiv xxv pp 5961 Any integral right triangle the greatest common divisor of whose sides is a square or twice a square i given by integer values of a fi in the formula a  2a  b a2 M c conv er  ely and conversely 97 7Vol 198 LEHMER wc oet C a2  62 a 2a6 An angle whose sine and cosine are both rational we will call a rational angle It is clear that such an angle A if we assume it less than 1800 will be an internal or external angle of an integral right triangle and therefore by Theorem I snA 2a8 si 2  l Sa a2 2 Cos  A  2 THEOREM 1I If A and B are rational angles s0 also zw A  B This appears by expanding sinA  B and cosA  B It follows from this theorem that if two angles of a triangle are rational so also is the third THEOREM III An integral triangle has rational angles and conversely a triangle with rational angles is either an integral triangle or similar to one For let the sides be a b c and the area K From the relations 2Kfi sin A bc b2  c2  a2 Cos A 2b we see that for integer values of a b c and K the angle A is rational To prove the converse we may assume one side rational For we may divide through by any side and get one side unity without disturbing the an gles Let a be rational Then hia B  sin A which is rational if the angles are Similarly for c Also K i bsin A which is rational Multiplying up by the least common denominator of a b c and Tithe theorem follows It follows from this theorem that we may represent the sines and cosinesRATIONAL TRIANGLES 99 of the angles of an integral triangle by the following formula taking C as the largest angle and therefore the only one whose cosine can be

areproportional to the sines of the opposite angles we get the theorem THEOREM IV The formula3 a  a 8 y2  82 b  a 88y a7 Fy 8 Cy a282 give the sides of integral triangles for integer values of a 6 a S Conversely by the above formule an integral triangle nmay befound similar to any given one We might have taken sin A  42 cos A 2a  a2  082a2 with similar variations for the other angles We should thus have obtained formule apparently different from the above but easily thrown into the same form  This theorem and the one following are given by Mr Blichfeldt in the ANNALS OF MATHE MATICS 1st Series Vol 11 p 57 He derives the above formulae in a very different way a way which gives him no hint of the geometrical meaning of the parameters a B y d The formulae of this theorem seem to have been familiar to Euler Commentationes Arithmeticem Vol Ii p 648 who gives them in the form abc y2 all CL5y7CyT as  2 a bc  Eulers method of obtaining them is not given the article being a fragment of which the first twentysix paragraphs are missing The following theorem is also contained by implication in paragraph 33 of the same fragment 7100 LEHMER THEOREM V In a reduced integral triangle the common factor of any two sides is the sum of two squares This appears from the formula asb2 c22bc2 a For in a reduced triangle a and 8 must be taken relative primes If then 8 divides b and c it will also divide a unless it divides a2  82 But the divisors of a2  82 are all the sum of two squares Cf Dirichlet Dedekind Zahlen theorie p 164 THEOREM VI The area of the triangle given by the above formulce is Aa8 7cabiey ayF8 THEOREM VII The radius of the circle circumscribed about the triangle given by the above fornulk is Ri a2  8 72  S2 It follows from the last theorem that in a reduced triangle the odd primes in 4R are all of theform 4n 1 Also from the proof of Theorem V it follows that every divisor of two sides of such a triangle appears as a factor in four times the radius of the cir cumscribed circle THEOREM VIII I wvefix a and o and let ry and 8 vary the resulting triangles will all contain the angle A or its sipplement THEOREM IX For any particular values of theparameters a  fy 8 wre get two triangles inscribed in the same circle For in both the triangles of Theorem IV R a282 y282 We may therefore superpose the circle circumscribing one triangle upon the circle circumscribing the other The two triangles are also seen to be such that two sides of one are equal respectively to two sides of the other THEOKEM X The two triangles of the preceding theorem may be placed in the same circle so that a side of one shall coincide with an equal side of the other The extremities of this common side together with the two opposite ver tices furnish the vertices of an inscribed quadrilateral with rational sides areaRATIONAL TRIANGLES 101 and diagonals By producing opposite sides of this quadrilateral till they meet we get a cluster of siX rational triangles Further the triangles formed by joining the vertices of the quadrilateral to the centre of the circle are also rational Finally by proper multiplication we have all the lines and areas integral To prove this theorem let AB be the common side and let the two integral triangles be ABC and ABC OD Then the angle BCCBAC is rational Also the A angle CBC is rational being the sum of two rational C angles Then the triangle CBC has two rational angles and is therefore rational The diagonal CC is Z5 FIG 1 therefore rational Also the angles of BDC are ra tional so that BD is rational Similarly for all the other lines of the figure COB is also a rational triangle having all its sides rational and the angle at 0 twice the rational angle CAB THEOREM XI A circle of rational radius may be found in which may be inscribed any specified number of integral triangles Choose a number m which is made up of k distinct primes all of the form 4n  1 We can then obtain 2k1 different solutions of the indeterminate equation y2  2 m Cf Dirichlet Dedekind Zahlentheorie p 164 Give now a and 8 any fixed values For every solution of the above equation we can construct two tri angles whose circumscribed circles have a radius ion a2  61 By choosing k at will the theorem follows THEOREM XII We may cut up any rational triangle into an indefinite number of r ational triangles Let ABC be a rational triangle Since an equilateral B triangle is not rational one angle A must be less than one other say B Lay off BD making the angle DBC equal to the angle A The triangle BCD has two rational angles  and one rational side and is therefore rational The same A D C reasoning applies to the triangle ABD The same process FIG 2 may be applied to these two rational triangles and so on sequentially102 LEHMER Knmmer has developed formulae for quadrilaterals with rational sides areas and diagonals Such a quadrilateral is divided by its diagonals into rational triangles and the diagonals make with each other a rational angle These facts might be of service in deriving formulae for such quadrilaterals Uxivznsr oir CrIcAGo JANUARY 1900  Kummer Ueber die Vierecke deren Selten und Diagonalen rational sind Creile Vol 37

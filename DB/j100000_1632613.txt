Demonstrations on pathology will be given from 2 to 6 PM daily MR E IH PLUMACHER the American consul at IMaracaibo has written the following letter to the assistant secretary of state under date of December 3 I should have reported sooner to you about the different convulsions of mother earth in this consular district during the month of November Excuse circumstances I was not in a condition to report upon such small affairs as I had enough to do to save my reputation We had since the tenth of November two slight ones here but heavy felt in the Andes states Then we had three sharp convulsions of little duration coming from the southeast The days were cloudy and no wind but it was very hot In day time those shakings are taken rather cooly but when in night time such freaks of nature occur and you hear the rafters creak and the tiles on your roof move and your bed shakes it is not exactly pleasant We had them but without much damage The damage came from an unexpected quarter It began to rain from 5 AM to 1230 PM in such a style that it seems as if tons of water were thrown upon the country I marked five and a half inches before 10 oclock AM All our houses were floated no tile roof after the shaking could stand such a flood I intended to go to the city anyhow at 830 in the morning on horseback to see to the condition of the consular office in town but it was impossible a stream of water six feet high with the rapidity of lightning came down the streets and I knew that was more than horse could cross There was no communication in town that day but next day I was at six oclock in the morning at the office only to find three inches of water in all the rooms not come by flooding but by leaking roofs not much damage was done in the office we can with little expense put everything in first class order The damage done to property by the water is great For ten years we had no rain sufficient to serve for the agriculture not speaking of the suffering people but now it came down in such an abun dance that the poor people can drink once more sweet fresh rain water The cisterns are full everybody can now hope for a good crop and there is water enough for the cattle in the plains and plenty food for them in a short time The Scottish Geographical Journal gives the following details in regard to the plans of the Mylius Erichsen expedition The in tention is to make a start about the middle of June 1906 on board the Denrmark the party consisting of twentyone persons among whom will be a zoologist a painter a doctor a botanist and a biologist Seventy sledge dogs and some motor boats are to be taken The vessel is to be steered for the east coast of Greenland and it is hoped that a harbor may be found in lat 700 From this harbor an expedition consisting of twelve men with sledges and dogs will start in March 1907 for the extreme north where its members hope to map part of the unknown coast of eastern Greenland This party is expected to return in July 1907 and if conditions are favorable it is contemplated that another party may be sent into the interior or may even attempt to cross the country from east to west in a high latitude say along the 70th120 SCIENCE N S VOL XXIII No 577 or 75th parallel The expedition is expected to finally return in the summer of 1908 and the sum of 11000 is given as its probable cost

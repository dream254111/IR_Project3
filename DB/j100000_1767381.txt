NOTES ON ANTHROPOLOGY I Edited by D G Brinton MD LLD Evolution of the Human Skull DR PAUL TOPINARD of Paris whose studies in physical anthropology place him in the front ranks of that science has summed up in a recent number of LAnthropologie the results of several years investigations concerning the trans formation of the animal into the human skull He demon strates that this change is brought about by the gradual de velopment of the brain and the resulting mechanical pressure on the hard parts adjacent The pressure exerted by the enlarging hemispheres on the occipital bone is in a direction backwards and downwards so that what is its su perior surface in ordinary mammals becomes the posterior in man and its posterior face the inferior The occipital foramen instead of looking backwards is in man turned downwards The increase in size of the anterior lobes of the hemispheres brings about still greater changes in that portion of the cranium The orbits are pressed from a lateral into a frontal position the face instead of being in front and ob lique becomes vertical and below the frontal lobes and numerous minor alterations in the anatomy of the parts are necessitated by these changes It is easy to arrange a per fectly graduated series of skulls illustrating this development from the lowest mammals up to man Next to him are the monkeys below these the lemures and then follow the infe rior mlammals Everywhere the principle of harmonic ac commodation of organ to function is strikingly shown Al though the general statement of this evolution has been frequently advanced it has never before received so complete a demonstration Physical Types in the Natives of South America The effort has repeatedly been made to subdivide the na tive tribes of South America on purely physical characters It was attempted more than fifty years ago by Alcide DOr bigny in his  LHomme Americain  but his plan has not VOL XIX No 475 proved satisfactory The latest scheme is that of Dr Deni ker who accompanied the French scientific expedition to Cape Horn He measured some eighty odd Yahgans a tribe who live on the southern shore of Tierra del Fuego He found them of short stature head large and mesocheph alic prominent superciliary ridges and malar bones fore head narrow low and retreating eyes small and horizontal orbits medium mouth large lips thick slight prognathism On the strength of these measurements Dr Deniker has urged in various scientific publications that we find in the Yahgaus a race quite different from tle Patagonians and allied to the Botocudos the Coroados and the Aymaras as well as to the ancient Lagoa Santa peoples This grouping allowing that it is anatomically accurate serves to illustrate how useless is an ethnographic classification based on small anatomical points The Aymaras Botocudos and Yahgans are as far apart in language culture and character as any tribes which could be selected in Soath America More over the Botucudos differ widely among themselves is phys ical aspects as Dr Paul Ehrenreich has abundantly shown In fine it is high time to dismiss the anatomical subdivisions of the American race and rely on language as after all when prudently employed our best guide Denikers theories will probably attract the more attention by being brought into relation with the interesting recent discoveries by Florentino Ameghino in the eocene beds of Patagonia This eminent geologist has described in a late number of the Revista Argentina de Historia Natural the remains of four species of monkeys from what he believes to be the lower eocene  which would place them far more re mote than any found in Eurasia the oldest there exhumed being from the middle miocene Ameghino therefore claims Patagonia as the cradle af the first Primates and of the im mediate precursors of Man Nor does he hesitate in this connection to add that in his opinion the very oldest relics of mans activity have been found in the same district We must however temper this enthusiasm by some hesi tancies When Ameghino assigns these beds to the lower eocene he does so entirely on palmontologic grounds The more cautious geologists are getting to rely less and less on these and to demand more and more stratigraphic testi mony This is alone convincing The native fauna of Aus tralia today is much older in type than that of Eurasia and similar instances no doubt existed in all ages of the worlds history Moreover the remains which Ameghino describes are strictly American in type His Anthropops perfectus although it had its teeth disposed in a semicircle as in man had nevertheless thirtysix teeth as had all the American monkeys both recent and fossil His Homunculus Pata gonicus was yet more Lemurian in type The evidence is far from adequate therefore to substantiate the daring in ductions which Ameghino draws from these finds The Question of the Celts The latest contribution to the vexed question of the ethno graphic position of the Celts is from the pen of the veteran anthropologist of Bonn Professor Schaaffhausen It is pub lished in the Festschrift zum Fiinfzigjdhrigen Jubildum des Vereins von Alterthumsfreunden im Rheinlande It includes a careful review of the classical authorities on the Celts and Gauls in which one is surprised to find a denial that theN bands who overran Italy in 393 BC were Celtic Surely the title of their chiefs brennus  king is evidence enough that they spoke a Celtic dialect The professor is also sadly out in attributing the North African blonds to immigration from Europe The blond type is essentiallyMARCH II 1892 SCIEIl that of the Hamitic Berbers who have lived in the vales of the Atlas from the remotest times In attributing the meg alithic monuments of western Europe and northern Africa exclusively to Celtic and Germanic peoples he proceeds be yond what archaeologists have conceded The difficult problem of the conflicting physical types among the Celtic nationsthe one short in stature brachycephalic and brown the other tall dolichocephalic and blond  he sum marily solves by supposing either an intermixture with other types or a change in mode of life and climatic environment The Celtic language he places as do now all leading lin guists within the Aryan group and in that category most closely allied to the Italic stock The same topic is discussed very ably by the French an thropologist Dr R Collignon in one of the recent bulletins of the Societe dAnthropologie After setting forth in strong lights the embarrassing nature of the evidence he finally leans to Brocas opinion that the small brown brachyceph alic Celts are a mixed type while the true and primitive type which we may call the Kymric was one of tall stat ure with reddish or blond hair and dolichocephalic crania An interesting portion of Dr Collignons memoir is where he points out the persistency of various physical types in portions of France for many centuries even for thousands of years as an examination of ancient sepulchres has proved MOTION AND HEAT Continued from p 135 BUT nature has other means of compensation for the molar motion converted into heat Incalculable units of heaten ergy are stored up in vegetable and animal organisms and in evaporation still more countless units of heatenergy are converted first into molecular and then into molar motion in its most terrific forms Evaporation and the function it performs in the economy of nature are as yet little understood It appears to be a form of expansion and like expansion it increases with elevation of temperature but it does not stop when expan sion ceases for it is well known that ice continues to evapo rate below zero C It is undoubtedly the great instrumentality for converting heat into motion It is constantly acting and in the trade wind region eleven feet of the oceans deptlh is annually lifted up and carried off by this silent process Molecule by molecule the aqueous vapor is torn from the liquid mass each one carrying or embodying so much heat and thus re ducing temperature in other words each molecule moved in evaporation furnishes work in the form of motion for so much of the force or energy which was dynamic in the form of heat Molecular motion evidenced by gaseous expansion in a closed vessel is governed by the general laws of motion and it seems incredible and anomalous to hold that the inert molecule moved in evaporation which unites with its fel lows as aqueous vapor and comes down again as rain is not governed by the same laws of the motion which this force or energy in the form of heat imparts to it in the atmos phere If these laws of motion do apply to the motion imparted by converted heat to evaporated molecules we have an ori gin for the trade winds far more simple than the generally supposed convection The trade winds blow over the tropi I Molecular Motion in the Radiometer etc p 16 CE 47 cal water where convection is smallest and not over tropical land where it is greatest But it is sufficient for the present purpose to show that heat is converted into motion in the process of evaporation and that even if the force or energy which in the form of molar motion is directly converted into heat by resistance cannot be directly reconverted from heat into molar motion there is in terrestrial nature a law of compensation which tends to convert any surplus of dynamic heat into dynamic motion and thus preserve the equilibrium which has been observed Professor Tyndall has taught us how to trace radiant en ergy from one body to another and how the dark or heat rays may be concentrated into the more intense light rays after they have left the body which sent them forth And Faraday Joule Mayer Grove and others have taught us the law of conservation by which we know that this energy when it disappears is not annihilated and when it reappears it is not a new creation We see its manifestation in mo tion molar and molecular we feel it in heat we see it in light and color and hear it in sound The motion may cease light may be extinguished in darkness colors may fade and sound give place to profound silence but the en ergy or force which caused all these phenomena was the same before they appeared as during their continuance and its potential existence remains after their disappearance with the same measurable units as when it was dynamic and subject to observation When the demon was cast out of the man and went into the swine and they ran into the sea it was the swine and not the demon who were drowned He doubtless passed out into demon land ready to again become dynamic when occasion offers This force or energy we are trying to trace while dy namic can only do so much work at one time If it is en tirely occupied in moving a mass it cannot do other me chanical work and if entirely occupied in molecular motion it cannot elevate temperature nor become radiant as heat or light And when rendered entirely potential as when a ball thrown up is lodged on the roof of a house or when heat becomes latent in liquefaction or evaporation or when the suns energy is locked up in the molecular structure of vegetable and animal organisms it can do no work at all until again rendered dynamic Its power and capacity when released is identically the same neither more nor less than when it was locked up This is true whether it was locked up as motion or locked up as heat It has always seemed to me to be unfortunate and mis leading that Professor Tyndall should have adopted  Heat a Mode of Motion  as the title of the book in which he gives to the world an account of his great and valuable researches in the delimitation of this force Like the term  Mechani cal Equivalent of Heat it results from mistaking the thing done for the thing doing it the effect for the cause hIeat is not a mode of motion and it would be just as inaccurate to call gravity a mode of weight or magnetism a mode of pull and even less inaccurate to call motion a mode of heat Motion and heat are forms or manifestations of the same force or energy and when radiant as heat and light it is more nearly disconnected from ponderable matter than when it assumes the form of molar or molecular motion Motion in all its forms is the transference of material substance ponderable or imponderable matter from one place or part of space to another it is the state of pondera ble matter in which the forces acting on it are not in equi

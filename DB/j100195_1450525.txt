Menasseh ben Israel came to England in the hope of obtaining from the Lord Protector and the Council of State permission for Jews to settle in England and to practise without secrecy or restraint the rights of their religion After two and a half centuries the history of Menassehs mission its origin its incidents and its conse quences has for the first time been setforth in the volume prepared by Mr Lucien Wolf for the Jewish Historical Society of England 1 In an admirable narrative Mr Wolf tells the story of the Resettlement and indirectly he makes it clear why the story has never before been fully told Whoever is at all acquainted with the sources from which the history of the seventeenth century has to be written knows that of all periods it is the most perplexing and intractable

Introduction and Notes by Lucien Wolf London Macmillan 9gor VOL XIV BTHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW had long vanished from human sight have had to be rediscovered and perused Private letters begging peti tions a Marrano merchants will the depositions of a common informer the gossip reported in News Letters the information conveyed in the dispatches of ambassadors have all had to be collected interpreted and judged before the historian could say with any accuracy or completeness what led Menasseh to England what he achieved here and what he failed to achieve Naturally a certain portion of the material that Mr Wolf has used was known to earlier writers who have attempted to deal with the Resettlement some papers also of which the earlier writers could not have known have now been made easily accessible through the publication of the Calendars of State Papers but the greater part of the documentary evidence that Mr Wolf has used has been brought to light through his own researches extending over nearly twenty years His predecessors had no notion of bestowing such pains on history Tovey gave a scanty and inaccurate account of Menassehs mission and em bellished it with reflections which are based upon the supposition that poor Menasseh whb probably never knew a years freedom from pecuniary troubles was the master of great treasures with which he bribed the Protector and the more godly members of the Council of State Dr Kayserling in his biography of Menasseh kept close to the facts which were within his knowledge but he was not intimately acquainted with the general course of English history in the seventeenth century nor did he use the best sources of information Some additions to the common stock of knowledge were made by Graetz Picciotto and Dr Hermann Adler but without disparagement to their historical zeal it may be said that their contributions are very modest as compared with the results of Mr Wolfs researches The writers who have been named were of course familiar with Menassehs pamphlets with some of the State 2MENASSEH B ISRAEL S MISSION TO CROMWELL 3 Papers and with two or three publications by Christian authors of the time relating to the Jewish question in England From these sources they were acquainted with Menassehs peculiar views as to the bearing of Scriptural prophecies on the resettlement of the Jews in England and with some details of his visit to this country and of the proceedings of the Whitehall conference They were aware of Cromwells friendly attitude of the favourable opinion expressed by the Judges in 1655 as to the right of Jews to remain in England and of the fact that before the end of the Commonwealth a small Jewish community was established in London But these scraps of knowledge were as tan talizing as scattered pieces of a puzzle until Mr Wolf equipped with a copious supply of new facts relating to the founders of the Jewish community and with a minute knowledge of the history of the Commonwealth was able to show how the puzzle should be fitted together It would have been impossible for any writer who had not studied with equal care the English and the Jewish history of the period to deal adequately with the Resettlement as indeed it is impossible without similar preparation to do justice to any important episode in the history of the Jews of England Just as the history of the English Jews before the Expulsion exhibits not only the fortunes and sufferings of some hundreds of Jewish families but also and as clearly the shifting relations of the Kings of England with their baronage the citizens of their towns and the Papal power just as the records of the Emancipation struggle serve both as a chronicle of an epoch of vital importance to the Jewish race and as a faithful epitome of the progress of Liberalism in the English nation so the Resettlement movement now that its course has been adequately described is seen to be at once a result and an illustra tion of the working of two sets of forcesof which the one compelled the Jews of Europe in the seventeenth century to seek new homes and new opportunities for the exercise of their commercial activity while the other caused BTHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW a portion of the English nation partly through tolerant feeling partly through a peculiar view of religious duty partly through commercial ambition to desire the un concealed residence of Jews in this country It is due to Mr Wolfs researches of which the results are set forth in his present essay and in his many earlier writiigs on kindred subjects that it is now possible to understand the nature of the forces at work and their reciprocal action The Inquisition in Spain and Portugal and in the dominions outside Europe possessed by those countries was the most potent of the causes that imposed on the Jews of the seventeenth century the necessity of looking for new homes in countries from which they had hitherto been excluded Great numbers of cryptoJews remained in Spain and Portugal after the great Expulsions of I492 and I496 and many of them acquired or retained wealth and distinction But when once they fell into the hands of the officers of the Inquisition their fate was torture and spoliation There is unhappily no lack of evidence to show how cruel were the outbursts of persecution by which the Spanish and Portuguese Marranos were at all times liable to be attacked Experience of suffering and the sense of insecurity which must have surrounded them even at the time of their greatest apparent prosperity drove one family after another of Spanish and Portuguese cryptoJews to seek a home in countries where they might hope to live unmolested The stream of emigration flowed steadily on during the sixteenth and the first half of the seventeenth century Marrano refugees settled in Amsterdam Rotterdam Antwerp Bordeaux Nice Hamburg Reggio Pernambuco and Bahia In the reign of Charles I and the early years of the Commonwealth a few merchants from Spain and Portugal attracted to this country no doubt by its Protest antism and its growing commercial importance founded a Jewish settlement in London They sought no authorization they raised no questions as to their right to live and carry 4 MENASSEH B ISRAELS MISSION TO CROMWELL 5 on trade within the British dominions nor for many years was any question of the kind raised to their detriment Their houses were unmolested and their business affairs flourished Thanks to Mr Wolfs researches a considerable amount of information has been collected bearing on the history of this community up to 1656 the year in which the Government of the country first had official cognizance of its existence The names of twentysix Jewish heads of families who lived in England before that date are known and information is available as to the early history of five Of these four are known to have been driven from home either by the experience or the prospect of persecution by the Inquisition and there is good reason to believe that this was the case with the fifth One of them Antonio Robles had first fled from Spain to the Canary Islands to escape tortures such as those under which his father had died and his mother had been crippled and from his new home in the Canary Islands he had come to England because orders had been sent out by the Inquisition for his arrest Another Domingo de la Cerda had for the same cause left Spain and taken refuge in England Duarte Henriques had been despoiled of his estates in the Canary Islands because he was a Jew David Abarbanel Dormido had been arrested by the In quisition put to cruel torments on the rack and kept in prison for five years Antonio Ferdinando Carvajal had probably been compelled by the Inquisition to leave his early home at Fundao In the middle of the seventeenth century the need for new homes for refugee Jews became more pressing than it had ever been before There was no cessation of persecution in Spain and Portugal the rising of the Cossacks under Chmielnicki in I648 drove thousands of Jews from Poland the conquest of Brazil by Portugal in 1654 threw back on to the old world many Jewish families who had for a time enjoyed prosperity in Pernambuco and Bahia And whether they came from Spain or Portugal fromTHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Eastern Europe or from America the refugees turned first for succour to their happilyplaced brethren who formed the Jewish communities of Holland To the Jews of Holland desirous of helping their coreligionists but confronted with a task to which their resources were unequal the fact that a small cryptoJewish settlement had recently been established in London would by itself have been enough to suggest that what had already been done in this country secretly and on a small scale might be done on a larger scale and with the express permission of the Government If Mr Wolfs only considerable discovery had been that of the existence of a cryptoJewish community in London in the early years of the Commonwealth he would have done more than any of his predecessors to explain the origin of Menassehs mission But this represents only one branch of his researches While the Jews of the seventeenth century were enduring in many parts of the world troubles which compelled them to look for new harbours of refuge there had risen into temporary pro minence in the political and religious thought of England two ideas which inevitably suggested proposals for legal izing the residence of Jews in this country In the fifth decade of the seventeenth century many of the sectaries and soldiers who were to become keen supporters of the Commonwealth adopted the principle of the unrestricted toleration not only of all forms of Christianity but also of Judaism and other religions Within the same period men of a different cast of mind endeavoured to persuade their fellow countrymen that it was one of the duties of England as a Christian country more especially with a view to hastening the Millennium to seek all possible opportunities for converting the Jews Mr Wolf has studied with great care these two movements of thought and their bearing on the Resettlement and he has been rewarded by discovering among the pamphlets and official documents of the period a remarkable number of proposals and expressions of opinion favourable to the readmission 6 MENASSEH B ISRAELS MISSION TO CROMWELL 7 of the Jews which are of a date antecedent to the publi cation of the first suggestion on the subject by a member of the Jewish race In 1643 Roger Williams in his Bloudy Tenent of Per secution for Cause of Conscience Discussed argued with frequent reference to the Jews that all forms of worship should be freely tolerated and that nonChristian systems of religion  are only to be fought against with that sword which is only in soul matters able to conquer to wit the sword of Gods Spirit the Word of God In 1646 there was published a reprint of the pamphlet on Religions Peace in which Leonard Busher had advocated forty years earlier a policy of complete freedom of conscience in accordance with which the Jews should inhabit and dwell under His Majestys dominion to the great profit of his realms and to their furtherance in the faith the which we are bound to seek in all love and peace so well as others to our utmost endeavour In i647 Hugh Peters published A Word for the Army and Two Words to the Kingdom in which among other remedies for the ills of the kingdom he proposed That merchants may have all manner of encouragement  and strangers even Jews admitted to trade and live with us that it may not be said we pray for their conversion with whom we will not converse we being all but strangers on the earth In the same year the Council of Mechanics at Whitehall voted A Toleration of all religions whatsoever not excepting Turkes nor Papists nor Jewes In 1648 appeared An Apology for the Honorable Nation of the Jews by Edward Nicholas in which the admission of the Jews was advocated in order that the English people might escape the punish ment that was due to them on account of their cruel treatment of Jews in earlier times and might in the future share the blessings which according to Divine promise the Jews were to enjoy In 1649 there was presented to Fairfax and to the Council of Officers a Petition from Johanna Cartwright and her son asking that under theTHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Christian banner of charity and brotherly love the Jews might again be received and permitted to trade and dwell amongst you in this land as they now do in the Netherlands This Petition  was presented to the generall Councell of the officers of the army under the Command of his Excellency Thomas Lord Fairfax at Whitehall on Jan 5 I649 And favourably received with a promise to take it into speedy consideration when the present more publike affaires are dispatched In the same year there appeared three further pamphlets of strongly proJewish tendency vizSadlers Rights of the Kingdom Durys Epistolical Discourse and Thorowgoods Jews in America while Chilmead published an English translation of Leon de Modenas Historia dei Riti Ebraici It was not only in print that proJewish sentiment showed itself in various parts of England and Wales Christian enthusiasts took to the practice of Jewish rites and ceremonies while the epitaphs in the Jewish cemetery at Amsterdam show that a whole family of English Christians migrated to that city to be received as members of the Synagogue Any member of the Jewish race whose thoughts had ever been occupied with speculations as to the methods by which the troubles of his fellow Jews in Spain Portugal and elsewhere could be relieved must have been deeply inter ested by this outburst of feeling in England Doubtless there were many Jews in the Netherlands in Italy in Spain and in Portugal by whom the new movement was watched But there was one man who for many reasons followed its progress with peculiar attention Menasseh ben Israel one of the ministers of the Jewish congregation of Amsterdam had lived in Holland since his boyhood but as the son of a Marrano who had left Lisbon after being persecuted by the Inquisition he had a personal concern for the fortunes of  such as sat in the Inquisition in Spain and Portugal and as a scholar who was in frequent correspondence on questions of Hebrew learning with English students of theology he was exceptionally 8 MENASSEH B IS1AELS MISSION TO CROMWELL 9 well informed as to the progress of religious feeling in England His disposition was such as to make him very ready to aspire to a prominent part in any movement for the improvement of the condition of the Jews He was a restless publicspirited man full of confidence that by the workings of Divine Providence a glorious future was being prepared for the scattered remnant of Israel and far from disinclined to believe that Providence might well regard him as one of the most suitable agents to be used in carrying out its designs Well acquainted with the existence of the cryptoJewish community of London he could not fail when his Christian correspondents wrote to him about the progress of proJewish sentiment in England to be struck with the idea that it might be possible to derive therefrom some practical advantage for his co religionists And there was a peculiarity of his Christian friends in England which strengthened the other motives leading him in this direction Among his English correspondents were men who attached great importance to what are known as Millennarian speculations They believed that the Millennium the period of a thousand years of peace and prosperity for the saints on earth of which they found predictions both in the Old and the New Testaments was near at hand Now it was generally recognized in accordance with the text of Scriptural prophecies that the Millennium must necessarily be heralded or accompanied by the restoration to the Holy Land of the Jews from all parts of the earth and on this subject Menassehs friends sought from him information and guidance Some questions which one of them put before him in 1649 set at work in his mind a train of ideas which led to a curious result It chanced that in the year 1644 a Portuguese Jew named Antonio Montezino or Aaron Levi visited Amsterdam and related in the presence of Menasseh ben Israel and other Jews of the city how in South America he had encountered Jews of the tribe of Reuben Five years afterwards when Menasseh wasTHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW consulted by his Millennarian friends in England as to the restoration of the Jews it occurred to him that this story might have an important bearing on the matter He had convinced himself from his Scriptural studies that before the Jews could be restored it was necessary that their dispersion over the earth should be complete The discovery of the tribe of Reuben in America showed that their dispersion was already much wider than had been known Indeed if they could only gain admission to Englandso the thought must have flashed on himtheir dispersion from one end of the earth to the other would be complete and their restoration to the Holy Land that event which to Jews and Christians was equally momentous would be so much the nearer Satisfied with the validity of his own reasoning Menasseh published in 1650 a pam phlet entitled the Hope of Israel in which he repeated and defended the story of Montezino hoping that the English people might recognize that it was their duty to expedite the ultimate restoration of the Jews to the Holy Land by allowing them to settle in England The practical object of the publication could be easily detected by a careful reader but was not definitely stated in the body of the pamphlet In order however that there might be no uncertainty on this point Menasseh dedicated his little book to the Parliament the Supream Court of England and to the Right Honourable the Councell of State In his Epistle Dedicatory he explained his reasons for doing so As for me most renowned Fathers he said in my dedicating this Discourse to you I can truly affirm that I am induced to it upon no other ground than this that I may gain your favour and good will to our Nation now scattered almost all over the earth neither think that I do this as if I were ignorant how much you have hitherto favored our Nation for it is made known to me and to others of our Nation by them who are so happy as near at hand to observe your apprehensions that you do vouch safe to help us not onely by your prayers yea this hath TO MENASSEH B ISRAELS MISSION TO CROMWELL II compelled me to speak to you publickly and to give you thanks for that your charitable affection towards us and not such thanks which come only from the tongue but such as are conceived by a grateful mind Give me leave therefore most renowned fathers to supplicate you that you would stil favor our good and farther love us That Menassehs intentions were fully understood by English readers was made clear by the controversial literature which his pamphlet called forth Shortly after the publication of the Hope of Israel he applied for facilities to visit England in order to plead for the admission of the Jews and he was supplied as he relates with  a very favourable passeport  From what has been said above it will be seen that there is no uncertainty as to the causes which led Menasseh to conceive the idea of his mission to England In view of the conditions that have been indicatedthe need of a new home for the Spanish and Portuguese Jews the hopefulness of the prospect in England as disclosed by the prosperity of the small cryptoJewish community in London the spontaneous display by English writers and public men of friendly feeling towards the Jews and finally Menassehs belief in the connexion between the return of the Jews to England and their restoration to the Holy Landit may fairly be considered that the inception in r650 of the Resettlement movement has been adequately explained The explanation is almost entirely due to Mr Wolf and it is he also who was the first to recognize the next important link in the chain of events When Menasseh first thought of advocating the admission of the Jews to England he counted no doubt on a large measure of support from influential sections of the English nation but he cannot have anticipated that the Lord Protector of the Commonwealth would be one of his most ardent helpers Yet Mr Wolf has shown that this was the case and by devoting the necessary attention to the trade 1 Vindiciae Judaeorum p I44 of Mr Wolfs editionTHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW policy of Cromwell and the commercial conditions of the time he has been able to show why it was the case In 1651 the English Parliament on the recommendation of the Council of State passed a Navigation Act which provided that henceforth there should not be imported into any part of the British dominions the produce of any country in Asia Africa or America except in vessels owned by Englishmen and that European products should be imported only in English vessels or in vessels owned by natives of the exporting country The object of this Act was to transfer to England the commercial supremacy of Holland Hitherto the latter country by virtue of the com mercial ability and large capital of its merchants had enjoyed a predominant share in the carrying trade and financial business of the world but if the Act should be effective the Dutch  would be disabled from bringing into England or her colonies anything but the scanty produce of their own soil  Now the Act could not succeed unless Eng land was able to command an abundant supply of capital and of business enterprise and ability The English nation which within the preceding halfcentury had magnificently inaugurated its career of colonial expansion by establishing outposts in the East Indies the West Indies and the con tinent of America was not wanting in the qualifications that commercial greatness required But a statesman with Cromwells breadth of view and widereaching ambition for English commerce could not fail to be anxious that the countrys resources should be further strengthened by the immigration of large capitalists experienced in the success ful conduct of foreign trade He was well aware that the continental Jews had won for themselves a preeminent position in the trade between the different countries of Europe and between Europe and the East and West Indies and Brazil2 he knew also that some cryptoJews were S R Gardiner History of the Commonwealth and Protectorate II 823 2 An interesting passage in a letter written by one Royalist agent to another shows that Englishmen abroad realized the importance of 12 MENASSEH B ISRAELS MISSION TO CROMWELL 13 already in England carrying on the same pursuits It was inevitable that when he heard of Menassehs suggestion that the right of Jews to live in England should be recog nized he should at once welcome a proposal that was so closely in accord with his commercial ambitions and with his inclination towards toleration in matters of religion The time and manner of Menassehs first communication with the English Government are not known with any exactness From the passage in the Vindiciae to which reference has been made above it appears that he wrote to the Council of State immediately after the publication of Cromwells action in 1655 In a letter to Sir E Nicholas dated Brussels September 20 I655 Sir Marmaduke Langdale writes  I am very sorry that they the Jews agree with Cromwell The Jews are considerable all the world over and the great masters of money If his Majesty could either have them or divert them from Cromwell it were a very good ser vice I heard of this 3 years agone but hoped the Jews who understand the interest of all the princes in the world had been too wise to adven ture themselves and estates under Cromwell when they may by his death or other alteration in that kingdom run the hazard of an absolute ruinNicholas Papers edited by G F Warner for Camden Society III 51 1 On p xxix of his Introduction Mr Wolf says that the Readmission of the Jews to England was one of Cromwells own schemes   there is ample evidence that he was the mainspring of the whole movement and that Menasseh was but a puppet in his hands On p xxxiv referring to Dbrmidos visit to England he says Cromwells action can only be explained by the theory that he was as I have suggested the instigator of the whole movement I am unable to agree with these statements Menasseh was certainly acting on his own initiative when in I650 he inaugurated the Resettlement movement by the publication of the English and Latin editions of the Hope of Israel with the remarkable dedication to the English Parliament and Council of State According to his own statement he was acting equally on his own initiative when almost immediately after the publication of his pamphlet he applied for permission to visit England Vrindiciae p I44 of Mr Wolfs volume It appears to me that in the absence of any direct evidence to the contrary Menassehs account should be accepted Of course my dissent from the suggestion contained in the sentences quoted in this note does not lessen my appreciation of the remarkable service which Mr Wolf has rendered by drawing attention to Cromwells vigorous and con sistent support of the Resettlement proposals and to the causes to which it was dueTHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW the Hope of Israel in 1650 There is no doubt that in the spring of 165I it was believed in Amsterdam that Cromwell intended to sanction the residence of the Jews in England and on this account as Menasseh wrote a few years later the Ambassadors of England were received in the Synagogue with as great pomp and applause Hymns and cheerfulness of minde as ever any Sovereigne Prince was For our people did in their owne mindes presage that the Kingly Government being now changed into that of a Common wealth the antient hatred towards them would also be changed into goodwill In October 1651 another letter from Menasseh was received by the Council of State and it is probable that a second passport was then issued to enable him to come to England Similar passports were issued in November I652 December I652 and September 1653 but the war between England and Holland July I652 to April 1654 and the difficulties of his own position in Amsterdam deterred him from making the journey In 1 654 David Abarbanel Dormido Menassehs brotherinlaw a merchant who had fled from Brazil to Amsterdam at the time of the Portuguese conquest came to England and acting no doubt in accordance with Menassehs advice presented to Cromwell a petition asking that the Jews might be permitted to settle in this country Cromwell urged his Council to return a favourable answer but they declined to take any action Within the next few months however Cromwell was able to give two remarkable indications of the good will with which he regarded the Jewish cause In February 1655 he took the unusual step of writing a letter to the King of Portugal asking that payment might be enforced of certain debts due by Portuguese subjects in Pernambuco to relatives of Dormido who of course was not a British subject and had no claim to the Protectors good offices In August I655 he granted a patent of denization to Antonio Ferdinando Carvajal and his two sons who were all members of the cryptoJewish community of London 14 MENASSEH B ISRAELS MISSION TO CROMWELL 15 In October 1655 after five years of waiting Menasseh at length decided to visit England c I could not he says be at quiet in my mind I know not but that it might be through some particular divine providence till I had anew made my humble addresses to his Highnesse the Lord Protector whom God preserve And finding that my coming over would not be altogether unwelcome to him with those great hopes which I conceived I joyfully took my leave of my house my friends my kindred all my advantages there and the country wherein I have lived all my life time under the benign protection and favour of the Lords the States General and Magistrates of Amsterdam in fine I say I parted with them all and took my voyage for England Several of the incidents of his stay in England are well known from accounts given by himself and by contem porary writers but on some points of the first importance Mr Wolf has been able by careful study of the authorities to correct statements hitherto repeated in all works on AngloJewish history When Menasseh arrived in London in October 1655 he brought with him petitions from the Jews of various parts of Europe and the English manuscript of his own Humble Address The latter was at once printed and published and on October 31 he went to Whitehall and presented copies to the Council of State The Humble Address asked in behalf of the Jewish nation for the free exercise of the Jewish religion  that we may have our Synagogues and keep our own publick worship as our brethren doe in Italy Germany Poland and many other places A detailed list of the concessions that the Jews desired was then drawn up and embodied in a petition presented by Menasseh to Cromwell in person The concessions were i security of life and property 2 liberty of public worship 3 the right to acquire a cemetery 4 permission to trade  in all kinds of merchan dise like other merchants 5 the appointment by Crom well of an officer to examine the passports of JewishTHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW immigrants and to compel them to swear allegiance to the Government 6 jurisdiction to be exercised by the Chief of the Synagogue in disputes between Jews with a right of appeal to the civil courts 7 that  if peradventure there existed any laws against the Jews they might for the sake of greater security be rescinded Menassehs detailed petition was referred by Cromwell to the Council of State and the Council appointed a com mittee of six of their number to consider it On Nov 14 it was decided in view of the novelty and importance of the issues raised to summon a conference representative of outside public opinion to assist the Committee of Council with their advice The persons summoned included three judges two wellknown politicians seven eminent mer chants and seventeen clergymen The conference met four times viz on December 4 7 12 and i8 under the presidency of Cromwell Of the proceedings of these days several accounts are extant and though none is complete there is enough evidence to show what was the general course of the discussion The two questions submitted by Cromwell were I whether it was legal to admit the Jews and 2 supposing it to be legal what were the conditions on which it was fitting that they should be received The first question was soon decided Of the three judges who had been summoned to the conference only two attended viz Chief Justice Glynne and Chief Baron Steele They both stated that there was no law forbid ding the Jews to return to England The discussion therefore resolved itself into a consideration of the second question Cromwell spoke several times indicating clearly his desire that the full concessions for which Menasseh asked should be granted but he professed that he had no engagements to the Jews but on Scripture grounds Sir H Laurence the president of the Council and General Lambert spoke to the same effect as the Protector Among the clergy who were more than half of the nonofficial members of the conference a clear majority4 MENASSEH B ISRAELS MISSION TO CROMWELL 17 favoured the view that there was no objection to the return of the Jews provided that suitable conditions were imposed to prevent them from attacking the Christian religion Some of the clergy were prepared to go much further and to support a resolution setting forth that it was not only permissible but was actually a Christian duty to receive and harbour Jews and to allow them to carry on divine worship This view was supported by an appeal to the prospect that England might by admitting the Jews take its share in the glorious work of converting them and might also escape the divine retribution to which the nation was liable on account of the cruelty with which Jews had been treated before the Expulsion in 1290 On the other hand a minority among the clergy fearing lest Jews might be more likely to convert Christians than to be converted by them desired that nothing should be said or done to encourage them to return to England The most strenuous opposition to the grant of any con cession whatever was offered by the representatives of the mercantile interest The explanation of their action is of course very simple Being in possession of Englands foreign trade they objected to a proposal that they should share it with Jewish rivals Merchants who each had his own affairs and his own profit to consider were naturally little touched by Cromwells far  reaching anticipations of the increase in the total trade of the country that might result from the introduction of Jewish capital and ability There is nothing remarkable in this but there is some interest in observing that the spirit displayed towards the Jews by the chief representative of the mer cantile interest at the conference was precisely the same that was displayed on other occasions towards English merchants The chief opponent at the conference of the admission of the Jews was Sir Christopher Packe  Of all the head pieces that were there says a contemporary poli tician he was thought to give the strongest reasons against their coming in Now Sir Christopher Packe was VOL xiv CTHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW the governor of the Company of Merchant Adventurers which existed in order to maintain and exploit the prin ciple that the right to engage in foreign trade should be the exclusive privilege of a close corporation and frequent complaints were made to Parliament in the seventeenth century by English manufacturers and free merchants  of the oppressive rigour with which the Company of Merchant Adventurers exercised the monopolies which it enjoyed On all such occasions during the Commonwealth Sir Christopher Packe showed himself the most active and capable defender of the vicious economic principle on which the Company was founded It is well to bear in mind these facts because they show that the violent opposition of the merchants to Menassehs proposals was neither an out come of antiSemitic feeling nor an isolated instance of commercial exclusiveness but the application to a particular case of an economic theory which was still widely accepted Apparently the view of the merchants was that although under the existing law Jews were at liberty to settle in England the Government should adopt measures to prevent them from doing so This view had no chance of accept ance since Cromwell himself several members of the Council of State and the majority of the clergy had declared themselves in favour of admitting the Jews under certain conditions But some of the clergy were willing that the conditions should be stringent and accordingly attempts were made to arrange a compromise One ridiculous proposal was made by a benevolent clergyman who in the hope of overcoming the opposition of the merchants suggested that the Jews should be confined to certain decayed seaports and should pay customs duties on goods transported between those ports and the rest of England besides the duties payable on goods transported between 1 Adam Smith Wealth of Nations Book V chapter i part 3 Of the public works and institutions which are necessary for facilitating particular branches of commerce I8 MENASSEH B ISRAELS MISSION TO CROMWELL 19 England and other countries In another resolution which appears to have been drafted by a responsible official or a member of the Government in order to express in definite form the wishes of the majority of the conference a different set of restrictions was suggested The draft resolution sets forth that to allow Jews to have synagogues and places of worship is not only eville in itselfe but likewise very scandalous to other Christian churches and that great prejudice is like to arise to the natives of this common wealth in matter of trade which besides other dangers here mentioned we find very commonly suggested by the inhabitants of the City of London A series of conditions is accordingly proposed of which the most important are that they be not admitted to have any publicke Judica toryes whether civill or ecclesiasticall which were to grant them terms beyond the condition of strangers that c they bear no publicke office or trust in this commonwealth and that so farre as may be they be not suffered to discourage any of their owne from usinge or applyinge themselves to any which may tend to convince them of their error and turn them to Christianity And that some severe penalty be imposed upon them who shall apostatize from Christianity to Judaisme To Cromwell who as a matter of statesmanship wished to hold out liberal inducements to the Jews to bring their capital to England the adoption by the conference of any recommendation in favour of admitting them subject to onerous restrictions would have been useless and worse than useless The legal right of the Jews to settle in England had been authoritatively declared and under the laws of the Commonwealth any person living in England was practically at liberty to celebrate any form of religious worship that was not Papistical Prelatical or licentious  1 The Recusancy Acts by which heavy fines were imposed on all persons neglecting to attend the Parish Church were repealed in I65Q S R Gardiner Constitutional Documents of the Puritan Revolution pp 3003 The Instrument of Government of I653 provided that no person was C 2THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW When therefore the inclination of the conference in favour of imposing special disabilities became manifest Cromwell at once dealt with the situation in the true Cromwellian manner He dissolved the conference without allowing it to formulate any conclusion and told the members that he and the Council of State had much need of all their prayers that the Lord would direct them so as may be to His glory and to the good of the nation In spite of Cromwells concluding remark no official communication was made by the Council of State to Menasseh nor do the records of their proceedings show that they devoted any further consideration to his pro posals Menassehs public participation in the attempt to secure the legal resettlement of his coreligionists in Eng land may therefore be regarded as having ended with the dissolution of the advisory conference His name is found indeed among the signatures to a petition presented to Cromwell on March 24 1656 by six members of the Marrano community of London and in April of the same year he published the most interesting and impressive of his English writings the Vindiciae Judaeorunm in which he defended the members of the Jewish race against some of the wild accusations that had been circulated during the discussion of the proposals for the Readmission But this tract admirable as it is does not appear to have excited at the time any large measure of public interest Apparently it was less read than its mystical predecessor the Hope of Israel Nevertheless during the months following on the White hall conference the position of the Jews in England was greatly strengthened Cromwell informally assured the members of the Marrano community that he would assist them to maintain the rights which they had been shown to to be compelled by penalties or otherwise to profess Christianity ibid p 324 Although no form of nonChristian public worship was recognized as legal ibid Article XXXVII there was apparently no penalty provided against the public celebration of Jewish worship 20 MENASSEH B ISRAELIS MISSION TO CROMWELL 2I possess provided they exercised them quietly and with discretion They acted in accordance with his advice carrying on their occupations as before and worshipping in a private house Their numbers were no doubt in creased by the occasional arrival of new immigrants The security of their position was successfully tested in the spring of 1656 in the course of an inquiry relating to the affairs of a Jewish merchant of London Antonio Robles Under the authority of a proclamation of the Privy Council declaring all Spanish money merchandise and shipping to be lawful prize property belonging to Robles was seized by the Government He claimed resti tution on the ground that he was a Jew of Portuguese origin and several of his coreligionists testified before the court of inquiry that he and they professed the Jewish religion In due course the goods of Robles were restored to him and the right of Jews to live in England was thus implicitly recognized by a quasijudicial authority Two facts of purely communal interest also indicate the security of the Jewish position in England during the later years of the Commonwealth In 1657 Carvajal and Caceres signed a lease for a Jewish cemetery at Mile End and in I659 Carvajal made a will in which he bequeathed 30 to the Jewish poor of London Thus in spite of the failure of the Whitehall conference and the silence of the Council of State Menassehs mission led directly to the establishment on a recognized legal basis of the Jewish community of England The result came about in a very different fashion from that which he desired and his disappointment was possibly due to some extent to his mistaken method of advocacy The restrictive proposals made at the conference by divines whose in clination was friendly to the Jewish cause may have been partly suggested by the complacent references in Menassehs pamphlets to cases in which Christians in other countries had been converted to Judaism Other passages in which he showed how large a share of the profits of foreign tradeTHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW had fallen into the hands of Jews in countries where they were well treated may have alarmed the London merchants and intensified their opposition Nevertheless in spite of his errors of judgement and the apparent incompleteness of his success Menasseh had performed a great and timely work for the Jewish race The favourable condition of the English law which the Judges set forth at the conference of 1655 had been previously unknown It was due to Menassehs mission that the true state of the law was declared by Chief Justice Glynne and Chief Baron Steele and this declaration was a greater boon to the Jews than any success that the most brilliant advocacy could have achieved There is no passage in Mr Wolfs essay which shows a more masterly understanding of the forces which were shaping the fortunes of the Jews in England during the critical period of the Commonwealth than that in which he points out how much English Judaism gained through the unostentatious manner in which the Resettle ment question was settled If the solution of the Jewish question arrived at towards the end of 1656 was not wholly satisfactory it was precisely in that fact that its real strength lay Experimental compromise is the law of English political progress From the strife of wills  had emerged a compromise which conformed to this law and which consequently made the final solution of the question an integral part of English political evolution The great merit of the settlement was that while it disturbed little it gave the Jews a future in the country on the condition that they were fitted to possess it The fact that in its initial stage it disturbed so little rendered it easy for Charles II to connive at it Had Menasseh ben Israels idea been realized in its entirety the task of the restored Monarchy would have been more difficult London would have been overrun by destitute Polish and Bohemian Jews driven westward by persecution some fanaticised by their sufferings others plying the parasitic trades into which commercial and industrial 22 MENASSEH B ISRAELS MISSION TO CROMWELL 23 disabilities had driven the denizens of the Central European Jewries Many of them would have become identified with the wild Judaical sectaries who were the bitterest enemies of the Stuarts while others would have given new life to the tradition of Jewish usury which for nearly four hundred years had been only an historical reminiscence in the country Under these circumstances we can well conceive that a reexpulsion of the Jews might have been one of the first tasks of the Restoration From this calamity England and the Jews were saved by the restricted character of the compromise of 1656 To Menasseh worn out prematurely by the sorrows of a troubled life the outcome of his mission may well have presented itself under a different aspect Mr Wolf states that he regarded it as a compromise of a purely selfish nature and conjectures that it was his refusal to rest content with the new settlement that prevented him from becoming the Rabbi of the London congregation The statement as to Menassehs attitude is somewhat more definite than the evidence justifies But it is certain that the man who had ventured into a strange country in the hope of securing a home for the Jews of his own and future generations found there no restingplace for himself Within a year after the conclusion of the Whitehall conference he was sick and destitute and yet it was not to the rich Jewish merchants of London that he turned I make my moan to your Highness he wrote to Cromwell as the alone succourer of my life in this land of strangers to help in this present exigence Cromwell in order to relieve his necessities granted him first a gift of 25 and then a pension of Ioo In September 1657 his son died and on his deathbed exacted from his father a promise to bury him in his native Holland Again Menasseh turned not to his coreligionists but to Cromwell and undertook to surrender his pension of which no part had yet been paid to him on condition that he should receive 200 wherewith to discharge his debts and meet the expenses of his journeyTHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW This sum was never issued Menasseh left England in the autumn of I657 and died at Middelburg in Zeeland on November 20 In the preceding pages some of the chief results of Mr Wolfs researches have been summarized but any student who would appreciate the remarkable value of his contribution to historical knowledge must familiarize himself not only with his latest essay and with his earlier writings on the subject but also with the accounts of the Resettlement that had previously been published In this way alone is it possible to realize how much more complete intelligible and interesting is his narrative than that of any of his predecessors The elements of the story which he was the first to make known include the existence of the cryptoJewish community in London before Menassehs mission the personal history of its members the growth of pro  Jewish sentiment in England before 1650 the relation between the Jewish question and Cromwells commercial policy and the quasilegal recognition in the period between the Whitehall conference and the end of the Protectorate of the existence of the Jewish community in London Until these pieces of knowledge were supplied it was impossible that the first chapter of modern Anglo Jewish history should be intelligibly written All that was possible was either an honest statement of disconnected facts or a narrative invested by hazardous conjectures with an appearance of completeness When such was the state of knowledge there was little to be gained from the study of this period of AngloJewish history As Mr Wolf has now told the story it is one of romantic interest so great are the issues with which it deals so varied the influences by which the result was shaped so unexpected the vicissitudes which six years witnessed And there is more than interest to be found in the story If the Jews of Europe are to be well equipped for meeting the troubles which may threaten them in the future they must be acquainted with the relations that have existed in the 24 MENASSEH B ISRAELS MISSION TO CROMWELL 25 past between their coreligionists and their nonJewish fellow citizens and when the history of a crisis in the affairs of the Jews in any country is faithfully told a great service is rendered to the race Such a service Mr Wolf has rendered He has for the first time made it clear who were the friends and who the opponents of the Jews in England in the seventeenth century against what prejudices they had to contend and what were the forces that worked in their favour By his treatment of one great episode he has shown how the history of the Jews in England should be written and in so doing he has shown why it should be written

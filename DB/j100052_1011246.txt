j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1011246,Our National Parks and Reservations,i242604,OUR NATIONAL PARKS AND RESERVATIONS BY WILLIAM ELEROY CURTIS Washington Correspondent of the Chicago RecordHerald Within the last few years three kinds of reservations have been authorized upon the public domain which now include I99672240 acres and fiftyfour game and bird reservations under the control of the Agricultural Department for the protection and preservation of the wild game and feathered denizens of our land Several other reservations are proposed including one for the permanent pas turage of the last large herd of elk which have been evicted from their hereditary winter grazing grounds in Wyoming south of the Yellowstone Park and find it difficult to get food enough upon the ranges that have not been taken up by farmers or eaten off by domestic stock There are four kinds of reserves the National Forests which embrace I94505325 acres in the United States proper Alaska and Porto Rico the national parks which include 3624472 acres national game preserves embracing about one million acres national monuments which include 1542443 acres and the numerous small bird preserves which have not been surveyed except in a few cases After years of labor by the American Institute of Archaeology the Geological Survey the General Land Office and patriotic individuals an act of Congress was passed in I906 authorizing the President to declare by proclamation historic landmarks prehis toric structures and other objects of historic and scientific interest situated upon the lands controlled or owned by the United States to be national monuments and to reserve as a part thereof parcels of land the limits of which in all cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected All persons are forbidden under heavy penalty to injure destroy or excavate at such places except for the benefit of museums universities colleges and other scien tific or educational institutions under proper permits from the proper officers Under this law twentythree national monuments have been created 231The Annals of the American Academy National Forests Until a few years ago the great timber areas of the United States were everybodys field for plunder and the mountains and plains were rapidly stripped of trees The consequences as shown by the floods and droughts along the water courses that were fed by springs formerly sheltered by this timber as well as the appal ling wastage by forest fires and timber pirates finally impressed Congress so that a law was passed authorizing the President to withdraw from sale and settlement such forest areas as in his opinion should be protected and preserved Under the authority of that act National Forests have been created in the several states as follows States Acres California 27968510 M ontana  20389696 Idaho  20099029 Oregon  16221368 Colorado  15698439 Arizona  15258861 W ashington  12065500 New Mexico  10971711 W yom ing  8998723 Utah  7436327 N evada  5I09415 Arkansas  3I89781 South Dakota  1294440 Minnesota

reserves within the boundaries of the United States proper there are two in Alaska with a total of 26 761626 acres and one in Porto Rico of 65950 acres making a grand total of I94505325 acres in one hundred and fifty National Forests 232 I6Our National Parks and Reservations For the convenience of administration this vast territory is divided into one hundred and fortynine national forests each in charge of a supervisor In all cases the supervisor is selected for his wide practical knowledge of the West and of the lumbering and grazing particularly For each of the many lines of work to be carried on in the forest men with special experience are required Those who pre pare and tend the nurseries must be experienced in raising and car ing for young trees The lumberman who cruises and estimates timber helps to plan logging operations sees that the scaling is correctly done and that the rules for logging are properly observed must be an experienced and capable woodsman The ranger patrols his district of the forest and sees that fire and trespass are pre vented that the range is not overgrazed that logging regulations are enforced and that the privileges granted by permit for the use of the various forest resources are not abused He also must be hardheaded practical and thoroughly honest an ablebodied citi zen of the West with plenty of experience in all the problems with which he may have to deal The National Forests are administered by the Forest Service a branch of the Department of Agriculture The forester with an assistant forester in charge of each of the four branches timber sales and planting grazing accounts and timber testing has general supervision while for field administration the western half of the United States is divided into six districts under district foresters with headquarters at Missoula Denver Albuquerque Ogden San Francisco and Portland National Parks The national parks and reservations under the jurisdiction of the Interior Department are as follows Acres Yellowstone in Wyoming Montana and Idaho 2142720 Yosemite in California   719622 Sequoia in California   I6597 General Grant in California  2536 Mount Rainier in

cities in the southwest a col lection of prehistoric cliff dwellings and several scenic wonders and natural phenomena which should be forever preserved from desecration Mount Rainier in Washington and Crater Lake in the southern part of the Cascade range of Oregon which is the deepest 234 I8Our National Parks and Reservations body of fresh water known It occupies the crater of an extinct volcano at the top of a mountain 9ooo feet high and is encircled by a continuous wall of cliffs from one thousand to two thousand feet in height There is no break in the wall which is so nearly perpendicular that it cannot be scaled except in a few places Wind Cave in the southwestern part of South Dakota east of the Black Hills near the town of Hot Springs is a remarkable nat ural curiosity as well as a health resort The interior of the cave has never been thoroughly explored It is like a honeycomb with more than three thousand rooms or cells and more than a hundred miles of corridors Some one has likened it to a sponge several miles in length depth and breadth composed of narrow passages connecting at different points with caverns large enough to enclose the capitol of the United States and beautifully decorated with feathers and crystals of gypsum that glisten like diamonds The atmosphere in the cave is so dry that it is recommended as a specific for diseases of the throat nose and lungs The Casa Grande Ruins in Arizona are the largest and best example of prehistoric architecture in this country Although par tially destroyed by vandals and the tooth of time fiftyseven large rooms still remain which have been put in order under the direc tion of the National Museum The Yosemite Valley now belongs to the national government having been receded by the State of California in May I905 It was accepted by Congress that year in a clause inserted in the sun dry appropriation bill but some of the California state commis sioners who had been opposed to the recession refused to sur render the property until formal resolution of acceptance was adopted by Congress June II I906 Since the government took possession of the Yosemite a steam railroad has been built to connect with the Southern Pacific and the Sante Fe lines at the town of Merced It carries visitors to a sta tion called El Portal at the boundary of the park A traveler can leave San Francisco in the morning reach El Portal without change of cars in the evening stay over night at a comfortable hotel and take a stage ride of fourteen miles through the valley to the Sentinel Hotel in about four hours It is also possible to go in from Ray mond by stage via Wawona in two days as formerly Since the railway was opened in I907 there has been a very large increase 235 I9The Annals of the American Academy of visitors but they are still amazingly few in number compared with those who go to Europe every year and obtain very much less enjoyment at a very much larger price The Yosemite will hereafter be open in the winter At the recent session Congress passed an act authorizing an exchange for the Calaveras big tree forest which was owned by a Minnesota lumber king patriotic enough to wait patiently for years for Congress to accept a grove of the most majestic sequoia trees in the world for timber land of equal value elsewhere on the public domain The chain of parks in that section of California belonging to the government now embraces 882ooo acres including the Mari posa the Sequoia General Grant and Calaveras groves of big trees all of which should be connected by perfect roadways so that the public can enjoy their wonders without discomfort and fatigue They are all within a forest reserve of nearly 4000000 acres which will belong perpetually to the government The House Committee on Public Lands has reported favorably a bill which passed the Senate last May creating Glacier National Park west of the summit of the Rocky Mountains and south of the Canadian boundary line in Montana It includes about 1300 square miles of the finest mountain scenery upon the continent averaging about o0000 feet above the sea level containing about two hundred and fifty lakes and sixtyeight glaciers Those who are interested in this enterprise are confident that the Canadian government will reserve a similar area on its side of the border it has already made a beginning which will make this the greatest park for natural beauty and the greatest preserve for wild animals in the civilized world It is proposed to put it under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Agriculture who already ad ministers it as a National Forest and who will permit shooting and fishing at such times and under such rules and regulations as he deems best There is practically no agricultural land and no mineralbearing formations of commercial value but in the canyons are roaring streams fed by melting ice and snow and there are more than two hundred and fifty lakes which abound in fish of many varieties The region is inhabited by a greater variety of large wild animals than can be found in any other one district of the United States Mountain goats and sheep grizzly and black bears 236 20Our National Parks and Reservatioins caribou elk moose and two kinds of deer are found as well as a great variety of other mammals and birds The animals use it as a breeding ground because they can find perfect protection The waters flow in three directions finding the Hudson Bay the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean Some of the mountains are of unparalleled beauty one of the highest peaks having been named in honor of the late Grover Cleveland Cinder Cone is a great lava field of extraordinary scientific interest within the national forest of California and is perhaps the best illustration we have of volcanic phenomena The Gila Cliff dwellings in New Mexico are among the most perfect and extensive remains of the prehistoric race which once occupied irrigated and cultivated the southwestern section of this country They are situated in the canyon of the Gila river in the southwestern part of New Mexico The Grand Canyon of the Colorado is well known It is in many respects the grandest natural spectacle in the world Jewel Cave is situated within the Black Hills national forest in Custer county South Dakota thirteen miles southwest from the town of Custer and was so named because metallic stones of bril liant colors are found there in large quantities It was discovered in 900o by two brothers named Mishaud who were prospecting for gold in that vicinity and has been explored for several miles A strange phenomena is the action of the wind which alternately and with great regularity blows in and blows out of the cave Lassen Peak or Mount Diabolo marks the southern terminus of a long line of extinct volcanoes in the Cascade range of moun tains in California and is not only a landmark of great beauty but is of special importance in tracing the history of the volcanic phe nomena in that vicinity The Pinnacles about nine miles due east from the Southern Pacific Railroad station Soldad San Benito county California are a collection of jagged peaks of impressive grandeur and much scientific interest The Tonto national monument is a group of prehistoric ruins located in the region commonly known as the Tonto drainage basin Gila county Arizona and is of great ethnological and educational interest as a relic of vanquished civilization The Wheeler national monument is near Wagon Wheel Gap 237 21The Annals of the American Academy station on the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad in California near the summit of the continental divide at an elevation of II500 feet The fantastic forms resulting from the erosion of rock and soil make the spot of exceptional beauty The numerous winding can yons and pinnacles form striking picturesque effects such as are seldom found elsewhere Historic interest attaches to the place because an expedition led by General John C Fremont was over taken by disaster in that immediate vicinity Skeletons of mules bits of harness and camp equipage have been discovered near the spot The Devils Tower is a conspicuous landmark in the form of a monster obelisk composed of lava and granite rising IIoo feet on the banks of the Belle Fourche river in the Black Hills in south eastern Wyoming The obelisk is 376 feet wide at the top and 796 feet wide at the base It is associated with many Indian legends and more than one fierce battle has been fought around it by the savages The Petrified Forest near Flagstaff Arizona is well known It is a few miles from the tracks of the Sante Fe railroad and covers a large area which is strewn with the trunks and limbs of trees that have been turned into stone by some mysterious process of nature It is unique among the freaks of nature Montezumas Castle is an enormous ruin situated about 60o feet above the bed of a creek fortyeight miles south of Flagstaff Arizona and 125 miles north of Phcenix Arizona It contains twenty large and eight small rooms besides a number of closets and alcoves evidently used for storerooms What the original dimensions of the building were is purely conjectural but the struc ture remaining measures fortyeight feet from the base to the sum mit being five stories in height and about one hundred feet long Other ruins of smaller dimensions are found in the same locality which were built and occupied by an extinct race that had consid erable knowledge of mechanics and an advanced civilization When and how it vanished from the earth is unknown but it is conceded by archaeologists that this is the oldest ruin in the southwest and that it was deserted long before I540 when Coronado made his expedition from the City of Mexico in search of the fabulous cities of Cibola El Moro or Inscription Rock is another important landmark fiftyfive miles east of the Zuni pueblo and fifty miles south of the 238 22Our National Parks and Reservations Sante Fe road near Wingate station It is a quadrangular mass of white sandstone nearly a mile in length and more than two hun dred feet in height Upon its weatherbeaten surface are numerous inscriptions in Spanish some of them deeply and beautifully en graved and dated as far back as I506 These inscriptions contain brief records of the visits of explorers and Spanish soldiers on the march of conquest or early Franciscan friars penetrating the wilderness to convert the heathen A special agent of the Land Office says that the Inscription Rock is one of natures most unique obelisks wrapt in the profound silence of the desert It is hard to realize that 500 years ago these same walls echoed the clank of steel harness and coats of mail and that with the implements of Spanish conquest the pathfinders of the new world were carving historic records upon the eternal rocks Chaco Canyon is another collection of cliff dwellings of great interest Muir Woods is a wonderful natural forest in California The Tuma Cacori national monument is the ruins of a church and monastery built by the Jesuit missionaries during the time of Spanish domination two miles south of Tubar station near the Southern Pacific Railway in Arizona The walls are of burnt brick twelve feet thick and only partially preserved Portions of mural paintings still remain on the walls of the chancel The natural bridges in eastern Utah and north of the Navajo Indian Reservation are not accessible to the public because there are no roads to reach them but that country is developing quite rapidly and means of transportation will ultimately be provided The bridges are more lofty and have greater spans than any other natural bridges known to exist Besides them the Natural Bridge of Virginia which is associated in every childs history with an incident in the youth of George Washington is a mere miniature The Utah natural bridges were created by the erosion of streams which worked their way through them years ago They have been seen and described by members of the Geological Survey agents of the Land Office and other scientists who estimate them as among the greatest wonders of the world The Lewis and Clark Cavern is a limestone cave of enormous dimensions containing a number of large vaulted chambers It is situated one mile from Limespur station on the Northern Pacific Railroad in Montana It has two entrances which are about one 239 23The Aznnals of the American Academy hundred yards apart in the walls of a deep canyon of the Jefferson river about five hundred feet below the rim and overlooks for a distance of fifty miles the trail of Lewis and Clark on their expedi tion to Oregon The vaults of the cavern have never been fully explored but those that are known are magnificently decorated with stalactites and stalagmites of great variety in size form and color similar to those of the Luray Caves of Virginia The area covered by the park system of the District of Colum bia covers 773 acres divided into 317 separate reservations varying in size from 250 square feet to 301 acres Of this area 117 plots of 361 acres are highly improved 125 of 324 acres are partially improved and eightyseven of about eightyeight acres remain unimproved What is known as Potomac Park west of the railroad embankment contains a little more than three hundred acres exclu sive of water surface In treating of this subject it is impossible to overlook the recent gift of Mrs E H Harriman to the State of New York of a tract of ten thousand acres of land and one million dollars cash for its improvement and the accompanying gift of I625000 cash from seventeen patriotic men and women of New York City to be used in purchasing adjoining land The intention is to make a park sixty miles long varying from 1200 feet to twelve miles wide upon the rim of the Palisades and along the west bank of the Hudson River from the boundary line of New Jersey to the city of Newburg above West Point It is understood also that the family of the late Abram S Hewitt intend to make a similar gift of eight or ten thousand acres south of the boundary to the State of New Jersey provided the legislature of that state makes an appropriation for its care and improvement When this scheme is completed it will be in several respects the most notable playground in the world embracing a total area of 45000 acres along the bank of a great thoroughfare and immediately accessible to three or four million people The United States is beginning to take care of its property Our people are beginning to realize the value of their possessions and are providing for their care and protection If the present administrations policy had been applied to the national domain fifty years ago it would have made an enormous difference in our national wealth but it is more important to look after future conservation than to waste tears over what we have lost 240 24

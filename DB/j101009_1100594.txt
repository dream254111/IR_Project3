TRANSACT BUSINESS IN THIS STATE UPON ANY COMPANY WHICH HAS ALREADY PAID THE FEE OR TAX HERETOFORE IM POSED BY LAW UPON ITS CHARTER OR FOR AUTHORITY TO TRANSACT ITS BUSI NESS IN THIS STATE DEALING WITH THE LAST DEFENSE FIRST IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT THE FEE REQUIRED BY SECTION 1104 IS WHAT IS KNOWN AS A CHARTER FEE THIS APPEARS FROM THE CONCLUDING PORTION OF THAT SECTION ANY FOREIGNI CORPORATION WHICH

LICENSE TO TRANSACT BUSINESS IN THIS STATE BE RE QUIRED TO PAY SUCH FEE AGAIN NOR TO FILE A COPY OF THE CHARTER WITH THE SECRETARY OF THE COMMONWEALTH IF A COPY THEREOF IS ALREADY ON FILE IN HIS

LICENSE TAX ONLY THE STATE CANNOT OR AT LEAST DOESNT INTEND TO NOW ATTACH THE REQUIREMENT OF THE PAYMENT OF A CHARTER FEE TO THE FOREIGN CORPORATION WHICH HAS ALREADY OB TAINED AND BEEN GRANTED THE RIGHT TO DO BUSINESS IN THIS STATE THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT AN AVERMENT THAT IT HAD PAID THE CHARTER FEE ITS WHOLE INSISTENCE INDEED IS THAT IT WAS NEVER LIABLE FOR THE CHARTER FEE BUT THAT IT HAD BEEN

York from a decision of the State Corporation Commission imposing a fine on appellant for transacting business without having obtained the license required by law Affirmed Wyndham R Meredith for appellant The Attorney General and William A Anderson for the Com nonwealth KEITH P This is an appeal from a decision of the State Corporation Corn mission imposing a fine upon appellant for transacting business in the State of Virginia without having obtained a license in accord ance with section 1104 of the Code of 1887 as amended by an Act of Assembly approved May 15 1903 That section provides that  Reported by West Publishing Company1904 AMERICAN SURETY CO V COMMONWEALTH 309 every incorporated company doing business in this State shall have an office in the State at which all claims against such company due residents of the State may be audited settled and paid Every such company incorporated under a jurisdiction beyond the limits of this State and hereinafter designated as a foreign corporation shall before doing business in this State present to the State Cor poration Commission a a written power of attorney executed in duplicate appointing some person residing in this State its agent upon whom all legal process against the corporation may be served and who shall be authorized to enter an appearance in its behalf b two duly authenticated copies of the charter of the corporation and c a certificate of the Auditor of Public Accounts showing the payment into the treasury of the fee required by law to be paid by such corporation and shall obtain from said Corporation Com mission a license to transact business in the State If it shall be made to appear to the State Corporation Commission that said cor poration has complied with the law relative to the licensing of a foreign corporation of the character of the applicant corporation then said dorporation Commission shall issue to said corporation a license to transact business in the State There are other pro visions of this sectioni which need not be at present adverted to This law is broad and comprehensive in its terms It applies to every incorporated company doing business in the State and upon its face embraces foreign as well as domestic corporations The appellant having been served with notice by the State Cor poration Commission to appear and show cause why a fine should not be imposed upon it for doing business without having complied with the section just quoted appeared and answered resting its defense upon two grounds First that sections 1104 and 1105 as amended were not intended to apply to it but that it was gov erned by a s 3ial law found as originally passed in Acts 1893 94 pp 758 764 cc 661 662 and amended at the session of 1895 96 Acts 189596 pp 284 423 cc 248 406 and second that it had tendered to the Auditor the specific license tax of 200 im posed upon it for the year 1904 and that section 1104 has refer ence to this license fee and not to the charter fee required in sec tions 3740 inclusive found at pages 178180 Acts Assem 1902 1904 and further that even though a charter fee was by law re quired of it it comes within the exception found in section 40 supra which provides that nothing contained in this section or310 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Aug the three preceding sections shall be construed to impose a fee for a charter or for authority to transact business in this State upon any company which has already paid the fee or tax heretofore im posed by law upon its charter or for authority to transact its busi ness in this State Dealing with the last defense first it seems clear that the fee required by section 1104 is what is known as a charter fee This appears from the concluding portion of that section Any foreigni corporation which has heretofore paid the fee required by law to entitle it to transact business in this State and has otherwise com plied with the laws heretofore existing relative thereto shall not on application for license to transact business in this State be re quired to pay such fee again nor to file a copy of the charter with the Secretary of the Commonwealth if a copy thereof is already on file in his office It seems too plain for argument that this has reference to a charge which is paid once for all and not to the license tax which is paid each and every year Nor does the appel lant in any event come within the exception for it nowhere ap pears that it has at any time paid this charter fee Its statement upon this subject is cautiously made Referring to section 1104 as amended appellant says in its petition to the Corporation Comn mission for license to do business in the State for the year 1904 that it only required those foreign corporations which have always been governed by section 1104 to pay the charter fee where suclh corporations are attempting to do business without ever comply ing with that section or with the law relating to charter fees All such foreign corporations are by the Act of May 15 1903 required to now pay this charter fee The Act leaves untouched that class of foreign corporations which were not governed by section 1104 as is the case with surety companies and your petitioner in particular In other words if a right to transact business in this State has once been granted on the payment of a charter fee and an annual license tax or on the payment of a license tax only the State cannot or at least doesnt intend to now attach the requirement of the payment of a charter fee to the foreign corporation which has already ob tained and been granted the right to do business in this State This is certainly not an averment that it had paid the charter fee Its whole insistence indeed is that it was never liable for the charter fee but that it had been permitted to do business without the payment of such fee and was therefoce entitled to continue its1904 AMERICAN SURETY CO V COMMONWEALTH 311 business upon the same terms There is neither allegation nor proof of the payment of the charter fee and therefore appellant is not within the terms of the exception to the operation of sections 3740 The case of appellant must stand or fall by its first contention Is it controlled by the law applicable to corporations in general whether foreign or domestic or is there a special law which applies to that particular class of corporations to which appellant belongs 9 The Constitution of Virginia section 156a art 12 provides that subject to the provisions of this Constitution and to such re quirements rules and regulations as may be prescribed by law the State Corporation Commission shall be the department of govern ment through which shall be issued all charters and amendments or extensions thereof for domestic corporations and all licenses to do business in this State to foreign corporations and through which shall be carried out all the provisions of this Constitution and of the laws made in pursuance thereof for the creation visitation supervision regulation and control of corporations chartered by or doing business in this State By section 1104 as found in the Acts of 19021904 at page 360 and which has already been quoted every incorporated company doing business in this State is re quired to pay a charter fee The amount of that charter fee is fixed by sections 3740 already referred to and the penalty for doing business without complying with the law is imposed by section 1105 Whatever may have been the interpretation of the law as it existed before the adoption of the Constitution now in force and the passage of the laws in pursuance thereof including section 1104 as amended there seems no room for question that appellant in common with every incorporated company doing business in this State must pay a charter fee or bring itself within the operation of the exception It would serve no useful purpose to inquire whether by a true construction of the statutes upon the subject in force prior to the adoption of the Constitution the appellant was liable to pay the tax and escaped by the oversight or inadvertence of those charged with the execution of the laws or whether the legislature had seen fit to place such companies upon a more favorable footing than all other corporations doing business in the State for whether this company has hitherto escaped by inadvertence or in accordance with the intent of the legislature there is nothing in the nature of a contract nothing in the nature of an estoppel upon the State to312 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Aug interfere with its unquestioned power of taxation Therefore whatever opinion might be entertained with refefence to the laws as they heretofore existed the Constitution and laws as they now stand unmistakably place all corporations upon a fotting of equal ity and all are required to pay a charter fee as the condition pre cedent to doing business in this State with a proviso that this charter fee shall not be exacted of those corporations by which this fee has been at any time paid The Corporation Commission which is the department specially clharged with the duty of grant ing licenses to do business in this State to foreign corporations nas given this matter careful consideration has found that the laws do not discriminate in favor of appellant that it is not within any exception that it was doing business in violation of the law and has imposed upon it the minimum penalty for its offense We discover no error in its ruling and it is therefore affirmed

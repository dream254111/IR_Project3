J100587,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16831775,105142,A LETTER TO SIR PETER THOMPSON KNT F R S CONTAINING EXPERIMENTS ON THE COPPER SPRINGS IN WICKLOW IN IRELAND AND OBSERVATIONS THEREON BY JOHN BOND M D,I206913,XXVIII A LETTER TO SIR PETER THOMPSON KNT FRS CONTAINING EXPERIMENTS ON THE COPPER SPRINGS IN WICKLOW IN IRELAND AND OBSERVATIONS THEREON BY JOHN BOND M D S I R Y O U MAY REMEMBER I HAD THE HO NOUR OF SPENDING AN EVENING WITH YOU IN JUNE LAST AND HAPPEND TO MENTION A SPRING IN THE COUNTY OF WICKLOW IN IRELAND WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE THE SURPRISING QUALITY OF CHANGING IRON INTO COPPER BUT YOUR CONSTANT LOVE OF TRUTH AND STRONG AVERSION TO VULGAR ERRORS MADE YOU DOUBT THE FACT WHICH AT THAT TIME I COULD ONLY AFFIRM ON THE REPORT WHICH PREVAILED AMONG THE CURIOUS IN THAT COUNTRY YOU THEN PROPOSED SEVERAL JUDICIOUS QUE RIES AND SEEMED DESIROUS OF BEING FURTHER INFORMED CONCERNING IT WHICH RAISED MY CURIOSITY TO TAKE THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY OF INQUIRING MORE PARTICULARLY INTO THE FOUNDATION OF THAT MARVELLOUS ACCOUNT READ MAY 10 1753 HAVING SOON AFTERWARDS OCCASION TO GO TO DUBLIN I WENT TO THE SPRING WHICH IS FROM THENCE ABOUT THIRTYEIGHT MILES AND MADE SEVERAL EXPERIMENTS ON THE182 THE WATER THE RESULT OF WHICH I BEG LEAVE TO PRESENT YOU WITH HOPING IT MAY AFFORD YOU SOME SATISFACTION IN EXPLAINING THAT PROCESS OF WHICH YOU SO JUSTLY DOUBTED THE ACCOUNT GIVEN BY SOME CREDULOUS AUTHORS WHO MISTOOK IT FOR A REAL TRANSMUTATION A RIDICULOUS DOCTRINE WHICH DESTROYS THE ESSENTIAL QUALITIES OF BO DIES WHICH WERE IMPRESSED BY THE GREAT CREATOR ON ALL MATERIAL SUBSTANCES IN ORDER TO DISTINGUISH THEM FROM EACH OTHER AND THEREFORE ARE INTRANSMUTABLE AS THE HISTORY OF THIS DISCOVERY HAS ALREADY BEEN ACCURATELY RELATED IN SEVERAL PAPERS READ BEFORE THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF WHICH YOU HAVE THE HONOUR OF BE ING A WORTHY MEMBER I SHALL ENDEAVOUR TO AVOID RE PETITION AND CONFINE MYSELF TO THE CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF THE WATER WHICH I AM TOLD HAS BEEN HITHERTO OMITTED THIS WATER FLOWS FROM A RICH COPPER MINE AND IS OF A SHARP ACID TASTE AND LIGHTBLUE COLOUR IT IS RE CEIVED AND COLLECTED IN PITS WHEREIN IRON BARS ARE PUT WHICH AFTER LYING IN THE WATER ABOUT THREE MONTHS ARE INTIRELY CONSUMED AND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PITS A QUANTITY OF COPPER GREATER THAN THAT OF THE IRON IS FOUND IN THE FORM OF COARSE SAND THIS FACT IS CONFIRMED BY PROFITABLE EXPERIMENTS OFTEN RE PEATED SINCE THE DISCOVERY THE HONOUR OF WHICH IS DUE TO MR MATTHEW JOHNSTON A WORTHY OLD GENTLE MAN AND ONE OF THE PROPRIETORS OF THE MINE WHO FIRST PROPOSED THIS METHOD OF COLLECTING THE COPPER AS THIS EFFECT IS CERTAINLY PRODUCED BY SOME ACTIVE PRINCIPLE IN THE WATER I SHALL FIRST INQUIRE WHAT THIS PRINCIPLE IS AND MENTION PARTICULARLY THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH I MADE WITH THIS VIEW THAT YOU MAY THE BET TER JUDGE OF THE INFERENCES DEDUCED FROM THEM 2 EXPERIMENT183 EXPERIMENT 1 INTO SOME OF THIS WATER TAKEN OUT OF THE STREAM ABOVE THE PITS WHERE THE IRON BARS ARE PLACED I POURD A SOLUTION OF AN ALKALINE SALT WHICH RAISED A STRONG EFFERVESCENCE AND PRECIPITATED A LARGE QUANTITY OF A DARK BROWN SUBSTANCE COROLLARY THIS EXPERIMENT SHEWD THAT THE WA TER CONTAIND A STRONG ACID WITH A SOLUTION OF THE SUBSTANCE PRECIPITATED EXPERIMENT 2 I PUT SOME AQUAFORTIS OR SPIRIT OF NITRE INTO SOME WATER TAKEN OUT OF THE SAME PLACE AND OBSERVED THAT THE STRONG ACID IMMEDIATELY DESTROYD THE BLUE COLOUR COROLLARY FROM THIS EXPERIMENT WE MAY CON CLUDE THAT THE SUBSTANCE WHICH WAS PRECIPITATED BY THE ALKALI IN THE FIRST EXPERIMENT WAS SO PERFECTLY DISSOLVED BY THE ACID SPIRIT IN THE SECOND AS TO TRANS MIT ALL THE RAYS OF LIGHT EXPERIMENT 3 SOME SMALL IRON NAILS PUT INTO THIS WATER WERE IN FOUR MINUTES SO CLOSELY COVERD WITH SOME SUBSTANCE OF A COPPER COLOUR THAT WITH A MAGNIFIER OF HALF AN INCH FOCUS I COULD NOT DISCERN THE IRON THROUGH IT IN THAT TIME THE NAILS GAINED FOUR GRAINS THE WATER HAD THE SAME EFFECT ON SILVER AND TIN BUT NOT ON GOLD COROLLARY THE COLOUR AND INCREASE OF WEIGHT WERE OWING TO THE ADHESION OF THE PARTICLES OF THE MATTER DISSOLVED IN THE WATER BY AN ACID THAT COULD NOT PE NETRATE GOLD EXPERIMENT184 EXPERIMENT 4 IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF THE MATTER IN THE WATER I PUT TWO DRACHMS OF SMALL IRON NAILS INTO THREE OUNCES OF IT AND LET THEM STAND TWENTYFOUR HOURS THEN EXAMIN D AND FOUND THE SUR FACE OF THE WATER COVERD WITH A THICK SCUM LIKE THAT OF A CHALYBEAT SPA IT LOST THE BLUE COLOUR AND SHARP VITRIOLIC TASTE IT WAS QUITE TRANSPARENT AND AT THE BOT TOM THERE WAS A QUANTITY OF A BROWN PONDEROUS POW DER WHICH WHEN DRIED WEIGHD 14 GRAINS THIS POWDER MELTED WITHOUT ANY FLUX PRODUCED 12 GRAINS OF PURE COPPER THE NAILS LOST 8 GRAINS IN THE WATER AND WERE IN SEVERAL PLACES COVERD WITH A SOLID LA MINA OF PURE COPPER THE WATER IN WHICH THE NAILS LAY AFTER BEING FILTRATED AND EVAPORATED AFFORDED A GREEN VITRIOL WHICH IN EVERY RESPECT RESEMBLED SAL MARTIS AND PRODUCED THE SAME EFFECTS WHEN DIS SOLVED AND MIXD WITH ANY ASTRINGENT TINCTURE EXPERIMENT 5 FROM THE SPRINGWATER TREATED IN THE SAME MAN NER I OBTAIND A BLUE VITRIOL THE BASIS OF WHICH IS COPPER FROM ALL THESE EXPERIMENTS IT APPEARS THAT A MI NERAL ACID IS THE ACTIVE QUALITY IN THIS WATER WHICH BEING DIFFUSED THRO THE COPPER ORE UNITES ITSELF WITH THAT METAL AND FORMS A VITRIOL WHICH IS DISSOLVED BY THE WATER AND REMAINS SUSPENDED IN IT TILL IT MEETS WITH IRON IN THE PITS BY WHICH THIS ACID IS MORE STRONGLY ATTRACTED THAN BY THE COPPER THERE FORE185 FORE IT QUITS THE COPPER CORRODES THE IRON AND CHANGES IT INTO A VITRIOL WHICH IS AGAIN DISSOLVD AND CARRIED OFF IN THE STREAM CONTINUALLY FLOWING FROM THE PITS WHILST THE COPPER DESERTED BY THE ACID FALLS BY ITS SPECIFIC GRAVITY TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PITS BY THIS ACCOUNT IT IS EVIDENT THAT THIS ADMIRABLE PROCESS IS A SIMPLE PRECIPITATION OF THE COPPER BY MEANS OF THE IRON HENCE IT HAS BEEN IMPROPERLY CALLED A TRANSMUTATION OF IRON INTO COPPER BUT LEST ANY DIFFICULTY SHOULD STILL REMAIN CONCERNING THE CON SUMPTION OF THE LARGE QUANTITIES OF IRON PUT INTO THE PITS I SHALL ADD THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS TO SHEW THAT IT IS DISSOLVED AND CARRIED OFF IN THE WATER OBSERVATION 1 THE WATER IN THE PITS IS COVERD WITH A THICK SCUM OCCASIOND BY THE AIR BUBBLES CON STANTLY RISING AND BURSTING ON THE SURFACE WHICH IS AN EVIDENT SIGN OF THE SOLUTION OF THE IRON OBS 2 THE IRON IS GRADUALLY CONSUMD IN THE PITS AND ABOUNDS WITH IRREGULAR DEPRESSIONS LIKE OLD IRON A STRONG SYMPTOM OF ITS BEING CORRODED BY AN ACID OBS 3 THE CHANEL OF THE STREAM RUNNING FROM THE PITS IS FURRD WITH RED OKER WHICH AFTER BEING ROASTED IN A STRONG FIRE WAS ATTRACTED BY THE MAGNET AS THIS OKER IS ONLY FOUND IN THE STREAM BELOW THE PITS IT APPEARS TO BE PART OF THE IRON DISSOLVD IN THE WATER OBS 4 THE QUANTITY OF COPPER FOUND IN THE PITS AFTER THE IRON DISAPPEARS IS GENERALLY THAN THAT OF THE IRON WHEN FIRST PUT IN FOR THE PROPRIETORS AS SURED ME THAT SOMETIMES A TON OF IRON WILL PRODUCE OR RATHER PRECIPITATE A TON AND HALF OF COPPER A A THIS186 THIS FACT ALONE WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO PROVE THAT THE IRON IS NOT CONVERTED INTO COPPER SINCE ACCORD ING TO SIR ISAAC NEWTONS TABLE THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF COPPER IS TO THAT OF IRON AS 9000 TO 7645 WHEN I WAS AT THIS SPRING IN AUGUST LAST IT RAN AT THE RATE OF 12 OUNCES EVERY SECOND AND BY PUT TING IRON INTO THE WATER OF THE STREAM RUNNING FROM THE PITS I FOUND THAT EVERY OUNCE CONTAINED THREE GRAINS OF COPPER HENCE BY CALCULATION IT APPEARS THAT 129600 GRAINS OF COPPER ARE CARRIED OFF EVERY MINUTE AND CONSEQUENTLY 124100 POUNDS TROY WEIGHT IN A YEAR SUPPOSING THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF THE WATER TO CONTINUE THE SAME HENCE WE MAY EASILY ACCOUNT FOR THE DEATH OF THE FISH AND OTHER PHAENOMENA IN THE RIVER WHICH RE CEIVES THIS VITRIOLIC STREAM IN A HOT SUNNY DAY WHEN THE WATER IS EXHALED THE HEAPS OF MOLD RAISED OUT OF THE OREPITS ARE CO VER D WITH A VITRIOLIC EFFLORESCENCE HENCE IN RAINY WEATHER THE WATER APPEARS LIKE A STRONG SOLUTION OF VERDEGRISE WHOEVER IS DESIROUS TO IMITATE THE PROCESS CARRIED ON IN THESE PITS MAY READILY GRATIFY HIS CURIOSITY BY PUTTING PIECES OF IRON INTO STRONG SOLUTIONS OF VITRIOL IT IS A COMMON EXPERIMENT TO TINGE POLISHD IRON BY RUBBING IT WITH ROMAN VITRIOL WHICH DEPENDS ON THE CAUSE BEFOREMENTIOND VIZ THE ACID IN THE VITRIOL PENETRATES THE IRON AND LEAVES THE COPPER ON THE SURFACE THIS EXPERIMENT IS ALSO TAKEN NOTICE OF BY THAT EXCELLENT CHEMIST AND CELEBRATED PHILOSOPHER MR BOYLE WHO CALLS IT A SYMPATHETIC PRECIPITATION IN HIS ESSAY ON SPECIFIC MEDICINES AS187 AS SOON AS THE ATTRACTION BETWEEN THE COPPER AND THE ACID CEASES THE MUTUAL ATTRACTION BETWEEN THE MINUTE PARTICLES OF THE METAL PREVAILS SO AS TO FORM LARGE SOLID MASSES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PITS NINETEEN TWENTIETHS OF WHICH ARE PURE COPPER THESE SOLID MASSES ARE PARTLY OCCASIOND BY THE PRESSURE OF THE INCUMBENT HEAP OF GRANULATED COPPER CONSTANTLY IN CREASING HENCE WE SEE THAT THE ART OF ESSAYING OR SEPA RATING METALS FROM THEIR ORES CHIEFLY CONSISTS IN EVA PORATING AN ACID WHICH PREVENTS THE MUTUAL ATTRAC TION OF THE METALLIC PARTICLES FOR WHEN THE ACID IS DRIVEN OFF BY THE VIOLENCE OF FIRE THE PARTICLES FALL INTO THEIR PROPER SPHERE OF ATTRACTION AND ASSUME A SOLID FORM FROM WHAT HAS BEEN OFFERD ON THE THEORY OF THIS AD MIRABLE PROCESS SEVERAL PRACTICAL HINTS MAY BE TAKEN TO RENDER SUCH SPRINGS MORE PROFITABLE AND PERHAPS AN EASIER METHOD MAY BE DISCOVERD OF SEPARATING COP PER FROM ITS ORE BY PRECIPITATION THAN BY CALCINA TION BUT SUCH IMPROVEMENTS I REFER TO THOSE MORE CONVERSANT IN THE PRACTICE OF METALLURGY HAVING I HOPE GIVEN A SATISFACTORY ACCOUNT OF THE EFFECTS OF THIS WATER ON IRON AND PROVED THAT IT IS OWING TO A STRONG MINERAL ACID WHICH IT CONTAINS I SHOULD NEXT INQUIRE INTO THE SOURCE OF THIS ACID BUT AM AN TICIPATED IN THAT CONJECTURAL RESEARCH BY MANY INQUI SITIVE GENTLEMEN WHO HAVE PENETRATED DEEPER INTO THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH AND DISCOVERD OR RATHER TAKEN FOR GRANTED A VAGUE ACID WHICH THEY SAY IS DIF FUSED THRO THE WHOLE MINERAL KINGDOM AND BEING UNITED WITH DIFFERENT MINERAL SUBSTANCES FORMS VITRIOLS OF DIFFERENT KINDS THIS HYPOTHESIS APPEARS THE MORE A A 2 PROBABLE188 PROBABLE SINCE IT IS ALLOWD BY MODERN CHEMISTS THAT ALL ACID SPIRITS THO EXTRACTED FROM DIFFERENT MI NERALS PRODUCE THE SAME EFFECTS AND CONSEQUENTLY ARE OF THE SAME NATURE THE SPIRIT OF SEA SALT ONLY EX CEPTED WHICH ALONE DISSOLVES GOLD SINCE VAST QUANTITIES OF SULPHUR ARE FOUND IN THIS MINE MIXD WITH THE COPPERORE IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE ACID OF THE SULPHUR IS ATTRACTED BY THE COPPER AND FORMED INTO A VITRIOL WHICH IS AFTERWARDS DISSOLVED BY THE WATER A FARTHER INQUIRY INTO THE ORIGIN OF THIS ACID I LEAVE TO THOSE CURIOUS GENTLEMEN WHO HAVE SOLVD THE PHAENOMENA OF VOLCANOS EARTHQUAKES HOTSPRINGS ETC FROM ITS EFFECTS THE INGENIOUS DR ROBINSON HAS LATELY ILLUSTRATED THIS DOCTRINE OF ACIDS  BY PROVING THAT AN ACID AND LIGHT ARE THE SAME THING FOR HE INFERS FROM SIR ISAAC NEWTONS PHILOSOPHY THAT WHATEVER ATTRACTS OR IS MUCH ATTRACTED IS LIGHT THEREFORE AN ACID IS LIGHT THIS SPRING PERHAPS IS AS REMARKABLE FOR ITS MEDI CINAL AS ITS METALLIC QUALITIES THO PHYSICIANS GENE RALLY RECKON COPPER TAKEN INTERNALLY POISONOUS YET THE MINERS AND OTHER PEOPLE DRINK THIS WATER FRE QUENTLY WITHOUT ANY ILL CONSEQUENCES IT PURGES AND VOMITS SEVERELY AND IS BECOME THEIR SPECIFIC IN SEVE RAL DISEASES PARTICULARLY IN CUTANEOUS ERUPTIONS ARISING EITHER FROM AN ALKALINE ACRIMONY IN THE BLOOD WHICH STIMULATES THE SENSIBLE EXTREMITIES OF THE CUTANEOUS AR TERIES AND OCCASIONS A PUSTULE OR FROM THE IRRITATION OF INSECTS LODGD IN THE SKIN BOTH WHICH CAUSES MAY BE REMOVED  SEE HIS ESSAY ON THE OPERATIONS OF MEDICINES189 REMOVED BY THE STRONG ACID IN THIS WATER IT IS AN EXCELLENT DETERGENT FOR SCORBUTIC ULCERS AS HOFFMAN JUSTLY OBSERVES IT HAS ALREADY PERFORMD SEVERAL RE MARKABLE CURES OF THIS KIND I HAVE OFTEN RECOM MENDED IT IN SUCH CASES WITH SUCCESS JOIND WITH PRO PER INTERNAL MEDICINES FOR I AM NO FRIEND TO SPE CIFICS HOW FAR THE SUCCESS OF PRACTICE OF THE MINERS WHO DRINK IT FREQUENTLY MAY BE DEPENDED ON LONGER EX PERIENCE MUST DETERMINE CERTAINLY A GREAT ALLOW ANCE MUST BE MADE FOR THE STRENGTH OF THEIR CONSTITU TIONS AND THE INSENSIBILITY OF THEIR NERVES CONSTANTLY EXPOSED TO THE NOXIOUS STEAMS OF DAMP PITS I NEVER VENTURD TO PRESCRIBE IT INTERNALLY AND AS THE MATERIA MEDICA AFFORDS VOMITS AND PURGES OF A MORE INNOCENT KIND I THINK IT IN THAT RESPECT UNNECESSARY I HAVE REASON TO IMAGINE FROM THE EFFECTS WHICH THIS WATER HAD ON SOME EARTHWORMS THAT IT IS A VERY POWERFUL ANTHELMINTHIC IF CAUTIOUSLY GIVEN SOME FRESH FILINGS OF IRON PUT IN THIS WATER SOON PRECIPITATE ALL THE COPPER AND MAKE IT A STRONG AND AGREEABLE CHALYBEAT HENCE IT MAY BE USD AS A SUB STITUTE TO SPAWATER WHOSE VIRTUE DEPENDS ON THE IRON SOME PREPARED FILINGS OF IRON REMAIND EIGHT DAYS IN THIS WATER WITHOUT PRODUCING THE LEAST AL TERATION HENCE IT APPEARS THAT THIS MEDICINE CAN HAVE BUT A WEAK EFFECT IF ANY AT ALL IN ABSORBING ACIDS IN THE FIRST PASSAGES THUS HAVING COMMUNICATED ALL THAT AT PRESENT OC CURRD TO ME RELATING TO THIS SPRING IF THESE OBSERVA TIONS RENDER THE HISTORY OF IT MORE PERFECT AND IN THE LEAST CONTRIBUTE TO GRATIFY THAT LAUDABLE CURIOSITY WHICH YOU ALWAYS SHEW IN REMOVING PREJUDICES RECTIFYING190 RECTIFYING MISTAKES AND ENCOURAGING EVERY BRANCH OF USEFUL KNOWLEDGE I SHALL THINK MY TIME WELL EM PLOYD IN THIS INQUIRY WHICH HAD ITS RISE FROM YOUR INSTRUCTIVE CONVERSATION I AM WITH THE HIGHEST RE SPECT S I R LONDON APRIL 15 YOUR MOST OBEDIENT AND 1753

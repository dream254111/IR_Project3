J100438,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY,1005167,LETTER TO MR NAIRNE OF LONDON FROM DR FRANKLIN PROPOSING A SLOWLY SENSIBLE HYGROMETER FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES,I241954,NO V LETTER TO MR NAIRNE OF LONDON PAJJY NEAR PARIS NOV I3TH 1780 S I R READ JANUA HE QUALITIES HITHERTO FOUGHT IN A HYGROME RY 28 I786 TER OR INFTRUMENT TO DIFCOVER THE DEGREES OF MOIFTURE AND DRYNEFS IN THE AIR FEEM TO HAVE BEEN AN APTITUDE TO RECEIVE HUMIDITY READILY FROM A MOIFT AIR AND TO PART WITH IT AS READILY TO A DRY AIR DIFFERENT FUBFTANCES HAVE BEEN FOUND TO POFFEFS MORE OR LEFS OF THIS QUALITY BUT WHEN WE HALL HAVE FOUND THE FUBFLANCE THAT HAS IT IN THE GREATER PERFEALION THERE WILL FTILL REMAIN FOME UNCER TAINTY IN THE CONCLUFIONS TO BE DRAWN FROM THE DEGREE FHOWN BY THE INFIRUMENT ARIFING FROM THE AATUAL FLATE OF THE INFIRUMENT ITFELF AS TO HEAT AND COLD THUS IF TWO BOTTLES OR VEFFELS OF GLAFS OR METAL BEING FILLED THE ONE WITH COLD AND THE OTHER WITH HOT WATER ARE BROUGHT INTO A ROOM THE MOIFFTURE OF THE AIR IN THE ROOM WILL ATTACH ITFELF IN QUANTITIES TO THE FURFACE OF THE COLD VEFFEL WHILE IF YOU ADTUALLY WET THE FURFACE OF THE HOT VEFFEL THE MOIFLURE WILL IMMEDIATELY QUIT IT AND BE ABFORBED BY THE FAME AIR AND THUS IN A FUDDEN CHANGE OF THE AIR FROM COLD TO WARM THE INFIRUMENT REMAINING LONGER COLD MAY CONDENFE AND ABFORB MORE MOIFTURE AND MARK THE AIR AS HAVING BECOME G 2 MORE52 ON HYGROMETERS MORE HUMID THAN IT IS IN REALITY AND THE CONTRARY IN A CHANGE FROM WARM TO COLD BTUT IF FUCH A FTIDDENLY CHANGING INFIRUMENT COULD BE FREED FROM THEFE IMPERTEDTIONS YET WHEN THE DEFIGN IS TO DIFCOVER THE DIFFERENT DEGREES OF HUMIDITY IN THE AIR OF DIF FERENT COUNTRIES I APPREHEND THE QUICK FENFIBILITY OF THE INFIRUMENT TO BE RATHER A DIFADVANTAGE FINCE TO DRAW THE DEFIRED CONCLUFIONS FROM IT A CONFLANT AND FREQUENT OBFER VATION DAY AND NIGHT IN EACH COUNTRY WILL BE NECEFFARY FOR A YEAR OR YEARS AND THE MEAN OF EACH DIFFERENT FET OF OB P2RVATIONS IS TO BE FOUND AND DETERMINED AFTER ALL WHICH FOME UNCERTAINTY WILL REMAIN REFPEAING THE DIFFERENT DE GREES OF EXADITUDE WITH WHICH DIFFERENT PERFONS MAY HAVE MADE AND TAKEN NOTES OF THEIR OBFERVATIONS FOR THEFE REAFONS I APPREHEND THAT A FUBILANCE WHICH THOUGH CAPABLE OF BEING DIFLENDED BY MOIFTURE AND CON TRAD6ED BY DRYNEFS IS FO FLOW IN RECEIVING AND PARTING WITH ITS HUMIDITY THAT THE FREQUENT CHANGES IN THE ATMOFPHERE HAVE NOT TIME TO AFFED IT FENLIBLY AND WHICH THEREFORE FLIOULD GRADUALLY TAKE NEARLY THE MEDIUM OF ALL THOFE CHANGES AND PREFERVE IT CONFLANTLY WOULD BE THE MOFT PRO PER FIIHFTANCE OF WHICH TO MAKE FUCH AN HYGROMETER SUCH AN INFIRUMENT YOU MY DEAR FIR THOUGH WITHOUT INTENDING IT HAVE MADE FOR ME AND I WITHOUT DEFIRING OR EXPIDING IT HAVE RECEIVED FROM YOU IT IS THEREFORE WITLH PROPRIETY THAT I ADDREFS TQ YOU THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNT OF IT AND THE MORE AS YOU HAVE BOTH A HEAD TO CONTRIVE AND A HAND TO EXECUTE THE MNEANS OF PERFEDING IT AND I DO THIS WITH GREATER PLEAFURE AS IT AFFORDS ME THE OPPOR TUNITY OF RENEWING THAT ANTIENT CORREFPONDENCE AND AC QUAINTANCE WITH YOU WHICH TO ME WAS ALWAYS FO PLEATING AND FO INFIRUAIVE YOU MAY POFFIBLY REMEMBER THAT IN OR ABOUT THE YEAR 1758 YOU MADE FOR ME A FET OF ARTIFICIAL MAGNETS FIX IN NUMBER EACH FIVE AND A HALF INCHES LONG HALF AN INCH BROAD AND ONE EIGHTH OF AN INCH THICK THEFE WITH TWO PIECESON HYYGRONIETERS 53 PIECES OF FOFT IRON WHICH TOGETHER EQUALLED ONE OF THE MAGNETS WERE INCLOFED IN A LITTLE BOX OF MAHOGANY WOOD THE GRAIN OF WHICH RAN WITH AND NOT ACROFS THE LENGTH OF THE BOX AND THE BOX WAS CLOFED BY A LITTLE IHUTTER OF THE FAME WOOD THE GRAIN OF WHICH RAN ACROFS THE BOX AND THE ENDS OF THIS FHUTTING PIECE WERE BEVELLED FO AS TO FIT AND FLIDE IN A KIND OF DOVETAIL GROOVE WHEN THE BOX WAS TO BE FHUT OR OPENED I HAD BEEN OF OPINION THAT GOOD MAHOGANY WOOD WAS NOT AFFEAED BY MOIFLURE FO AS TO CHANGE ITS DIMENFIONS AND THAT IT WAS ALWAYS TO BE FOUND AS THE TOOLS OF THE WORKMAN LEFT IT INDEED THE DIFFERENCE AT DIFFERENT TIMES IN THE FAME COUNTRY IS FO FMALL AS TO BE FCARCELY IN A COM MON WAY OBFERVABLE HENCE THE BOX WHICH WAS MADE FO AS TO ALLOW FUFFICIENT ROOM FOR THE MAGNETS TO FLIDE OUT AND IN FREELY AND WHEN IN AFFORDED THEM FO MUCH PLAY THAT BY FFAKING THE BOX ONE COULD MAKE THEM FIRIKE THE OP POFITE FIDES ALTERNATELY CONTINUED IN THE FAME FTATE ALL THE TIME I REMAINED IN ENGLAND WHICH WAS FOUR YEARS WITH OUT ANY APPARENT ALTERATION I LEFT ENGLAND IN AUGUFL 1762 AND ARRIVED AT PHILADELPHIA IN OAOBER THE FAME YEAR IN A FEW WEEKS AFTER MY ARRIVAL BEING DEFIROUS OF FHOWING YOUR MAGNETS TO A PHILOFOPHICAL FRIEND I FOUND THEM FO TIGHT IN THE BOX THAT IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY I GOT THEM OUT AND CONFLANTLY DURING THE TWO YEARS I REMAIN ED THERE VIZ TILL NOVEMBER 1764 THIS DIFFICULTY OF GET TING THEM OUT AND IN CONTINUED THE LITTLE IHUTTER TOO AS WOOD DOES NOT IHRINK LENGTH WAYS OF THE GRAIN WAS FOUND TOO LONG TO ENTER ITS GROOVES AND NOT BEING UFED WAS MIFLAID AND LOFT AND I AFTERWARDS HAD ANOTHER MADE THAT FITTED IN DECEMBER I 764 I RETURNED TO ENGLAND AND AFTER FOME TIME I OBFERVED THAT MY BOX WAS BECOME FULL BIG ENOUGH FOR MY MAGNETS AND TOO WIDE FOR MY NEW FFUTTER WHICH WAS FO MUCH TOO FHORT FOR ITS GROOVES THAT IT WAS APT TO FALL54 ON HYGROMETERS FALL OUT AND TO MAKE IT KEEP IN I LENGTHENED IT BY ADDING TO EACH END A LITTLE COAT OF FEALINGWAX I CONTINUED IN ENGLAND MORE THAN TEN YEARS AND DURING ALL THAT TIME AFTER THE FIRFI CHANGE I PERCEIVED NO ALTERATION THE MAGNETS HAD THE FAME FREEDOM IN THEIR BOX AND THE LITTLE FHUTTER CONTINUED WITH THE ADDED FEALINGWAX TO FIT ITS GROOVES TILL FOME WEEKS AFTER MY FECOND RETURN TO A MERICA AS I COULD NOT IMAGINE ANY OTHER CAUFE FOR THIS CHANGE OF DIMENFIONS IN THE BOX WHEN IN THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES I CONCLUDED FIRFT GENERALLY THAT THE AIR OF ENGLAND WAS MOIFLER THAN THAT OF AMERICA AND THIS I FUPPOFED AN EF FEA OF ITS BEING AN IFLAND WHERE EVERY WIND THAT BLEW MUFT NECEFFARILY PAFS OVER FOME FEA BEFORE IT ARRIVED AND OF COURFE LICK UP FOME VAPOUR I AFTERWARDS INDEED DOUBT ED WHETHER IT MIGHT BE JUFT ONLY FO FAR AS RELATED TO THE CITY OF LONDON WHERE I REFIDED BECAUFE THERE ARE MANY CAUFES OF MOIFLURE IN THE CITY AIR WHICH DO NOT EXIFT TO THE FAME DEGREE IN THE COUNTRY FUCH AS THE BREWERS AND DYERS BOILING CALDRONS AND THE GREAT NUMBER OF POTS AND TEAKET TLES CONTINUALLY ON THE FIRE FENDING FOURTH ABUNDANCE OF VAPOUR AND ALFO THE NUMBER OF ANIMALS WHO BY THEIR BREATH CONTINUALLY INCREAFE IT TO WHICH MAY BE ADDED THAT EVEN THE VAFT QUANTITY OF FEA COALS BURNT THERE DO IN KINDLING DIFCHARGE A GREAT DEAL OF MOIFTURE WHEN I WAS IN ENGLAND THE LAFT TIME YOU ALFO MADE FOR ME A LITTLE ACHROMATIC POCKET TELEFCOPE THE BODY WAS BRAFS AND IT HAD A ROUND CAFE I THINK OF THIN WOOD COVERED WITH FHAGRIN ALL THE WHILE I REMAINED IN ENGLAND THOUGH POFFIBLY THERE MIGHT BE FOME FMALL CHANGES IN THE DIMENFIONS OF THIS CAFE I NEITHER PERCEIVED NOR FUFPEDED ANY THERE WAS ALWAYS COMFORTABLE ROOM FOR THE TELE FCOPE TO FLIP IN AND OUT BUT FOON AFTER I ARRIVED IN AME RICA WHICH WAS IN MAY I 775 THE CAFE BECAME TOO FMALL FOR THE INFTRUMENT IT WAS WITH MUCH DIFFICULTY AND VARI OUS CONTRIVANCES THAT I GOT IT OUT AND I COULD NEVER AFTER GETOX HYGROMETERS SS GET IT IN AGAIN DURING MY FLAY THERE WHICH WAS EIGHTEEN MONTHS I BROUGHT IT WITLH ME TO EUROPE BUT LEFT THE CAFE AS UFELEFS IMAGINING THAT I FHOULD FIND THE CONTINENTAL AIR OF FRANCE AS DRY AS THAT OF PENNFYLVANIA WHERE MY MAG NET BOX HAD ALFO RETURNED A FECOND TIME TO ITS NARROWNEFS AND PINCHED THE PIECES AS HERETOFORE OBLIGING ME TOO TO FCRAPE THE FEALINGWAX OFF THE ENDS OF THE IHUTTER I HAD NOT BEEN LONG IN FRANCE BEFORE I WAS FURPRIFED TO FIND THAT MY BOX WAS BECOME AS LARGE AS IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN IN ENGLAND THE MAGNETS ENTERED AND CAME OUT WITH THE FAME FREEDOM AND WHEN IN I COULD RATTLE THEM AGAINFT ITS FIDES THIS HAS CONTINUED TO BE THE CAFE WITHOUT FENFIBLE VARIATI ON MY HABITATION IS OUT OF PARIS DIFTANT ALMOFT A LEAGUE FO THAT THE MOIFT AIR OF THE CITY CANNOT BE FUPPOFED TO HAVE MUCH EFFEAL UPON THE BOX 1 AM ON A HIGH DRY HILL IN A FREE AIR AS LIKELY TO BE DRY AS ANY AIR IN FRANCE WHENCE IT FEEMS PROBABLE THAT THE AIR OF ENGLAND IN GENERAL MAY AS WELL AS THAT OF LONDON BE MOIFTER THAN THE AIR OF AME RICA FINCE THAT OF FRANCE IS FO AND IN A PART FO DIFLANT FRORMT THE FEA THE GREATER DRYNEFS OF THE AIR IN AMERICA APPEARS FROM FOME OTHER OBFERVATIONS THE CABINET WORK FORMERLY FENT US FROM LONDON WHICH CONFIFIED IN THIN PLATES OF FINE WOOD GLUED UPON FIR NEVER WOULD FLAND WITHL US THE VAN CERING AS THOFE PLATES ARE CALLED WOULD GET LOOFE AND COME OFF BOTH WOODS FHRINKING AND THEIR GRAINS OFTEN CROFFING THEY WERE FOREVER CRACKING AND FLYING AND IN MY ELEC TRICAL EXPERIMENTS THERE IT WAS REMARKABLE THAT A MAHO GANY TABLE ON WHICH MY JARS FLOOD UNDER THE PRIME CON DUDOR TO BE CHARGED WOULD OFTEN BE FO DRY PARTICULARLY WHEN THE WIND HAD BEEN FOME TIME AT NORTHWEFT WHICH WITH US IS A VERY DRYING WIND AS TO IFOLATE THE JARS AND PREVENT THEIR BEING CHARGED TILL I HAD FORMED A COMMUNI CATION BETWEEN THEIR COATINGS AND THE EARTH I HAD A LIKE TABLE IN LONDON WHICH I UFED FOR THE FAME PURPOFE ALL THE TIME I REFIDED THERE BUT IT WAS NEVER FO DRY AS TO REFUFE CONDUCTING THE ELETRICITY NOW36 ON HYGROMETERS NOW WHAT I WOULD BEG LEAVE TO RECOMMEND TO YOU I8 THAT YOU WOULD RECOLLEAC IF YOU CAN THE FPECIES OF MAHOGA NY OF WHICH YOU MADE MY BOX FOR YOU KNOW THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF DIFFERENCE IN WOODS THAT GO UNDER THAT NAME OR IF THAT CANNOT BE THAT YOU WOULD TAKE A NUMBER OF PIECES OF THE CLOFEFT AND FINEFT GRAINED MAHOGANY THAT YOU CAN MEET WITH PLANE THEM TO THE THINNEFS OF ABOUT A LINE AND THE WIDTH OF ABOUT TWO INCHES ACROFS THE GRAIN AND FIX EACH OF THE PIECES IN FOME INFTRUMENT THAT YOU CAN CON TRIVE WHICH WILL PERMIT THEM TO CONTRAL AND DILATE AND WILL HOW IN FENFIBLE DEGREES BY A MOVEABLE HAND UPON A MARKED FCALE THE OTHERWIFE LEFS FENFIBLE QUANTITIES OF FUCHL CONTRATION AND DILATATION IF THEFE INFTRUMENTS ARE ALL KEPT IN THE FAME PLACE WHILE MAKING AND ARE GRADUATED TOGETHER WHILE FUBJE TO THE FAME DEGREES OF MOIFTURE OR DRYNEFS I APPREHEND YOU WILL HAVE FO MANY COMPARABLE HYGROMETERS WHICH BEING FENT INTO DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND CONTINUED THERE FOR FOME TIME WILL FIND AND HOW THERE THE MEAN OF THE DIFFERENT DRYNEFS AND MOIFTURE OF THE AIR OF THOFE COUNTRIES AND THAT WITH MUCH LEFS TROUBLE THAN BY ANY HYGROMETER HITHERTO IN UFE WITH GREAT EFTEEM I AM DEAR FIR YOUR MOFT OBEDIENT AND MOFT HUMBLE FERVANT B FRANKLIN DEFCRIPTION
